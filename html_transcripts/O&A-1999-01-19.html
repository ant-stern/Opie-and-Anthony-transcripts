<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their "Two for Tuesday" music playlist, admitting they didn't always enjoy the songs. This transitioned into a humorous segment analyzing the New York Jets' recent loss, incorporating a Star Trek theme with William Shatner's commentary.  Listener calls and faxes followed, with one comparing the Doomsday Machine to a giant marijuana cigarette.

The show then covered a colleague's radio award win, which the hosts found uninteresting.  This led into a discussion of their "Tuesday Night Hummer Club" and listener-submitted songs.  Mick Jagger's marital status and jokes about older women were also part of this segment.  A listener submitted coloring book pages of *Big Comfy Couch*'s character, prompting sexually suggestive jokes about the actress.  They promoted their "Get Your Aggression Out" event, involving object destruction, and mused on other ideas like smashing TVs with bowling balls.  The Knicks' potential Sprewell signing and the Islanders' losing streak were briefly touched upon.

An interview with an injured Jets fan was mentioned, followed by a discussion about a woman flashing her breasts at an event and Black Earl's photographic failure due to his camera's slow shutter speed. The woman, Karen, called in and offered a repeat performance for photos.  Bill Clinton's State of the Union address and one host's Tomb Raider 3 marathon were briefly mentioned. The show concluded with more Hummer Club songs, Joe DiMaggio's recovery and Steinbrenner's reaction, a bizarre "Popeye Dice Clay" caller suggestion, and a final mention of Stephen Lynch's upcoming appearance.  A humorous anecdote about Regis Philbin being hit at a hockey game ended the segment.

The next segment opened with a recounting of a humorous physical altercation between Regis Philbin and Stone Cold Steve Austin on Regis's show.  The hosts discussed extending the show's runtime, expressing some uncertainty about their producer Gary's feelings.  The conversation shifted to the upcoming guest, Stephen Lynch, and his songs about hermaphrodites, kittens, and a priest.  They discussed favorite past guests including Mark Golan (Maxim), Lewis Black (Economy Central), and their highly selective guest policy.  They explicitly detailed their "list" of approved guests, including Black Earl, "Ben the Fag," and the "Hummer Queen," emphasizing their strict criteria to maintain the show's energy and avoid disruptions. They concluded by describing their new, formalized guest admittance system, featuring a velvet rope and Black Earl as the gatekeeper.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with R.E.M.  That's the Sorry song.  A lot of people don't know what the real title of that song is, Anthony.  Ah.  It's called South Central Rain from the reckoning CD.  And Orange Crush from Green before that.  And there's 2 for Tuesday.  On the way, we got some ACDC.  Oh, we're playing Money Talks today.  Very cool.  All right.  It's Edge CD, a fine CD by the band.  You have the music in front of us there, Opie.  Are we rocking today?  We are definitely rocking, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  I must say.  Let me take a little peek at the 2 for us coming up.  Take a little 2 for a peek.  I'm going to take a peek at the 2 first.  You too.  Stones, Springsteen, like it.  Petty, okay.  Very good.  Harald Smith, Metallica, Adores.  Oh, good, good.  Meat and Potato, Rock and Roll.  That's what I like.  I like it.  Van Halen, Bowie, Crows.  And Melonhead.  Very nice.  Nothing silly in there?  Honestly, no.  Good.  I think I like every song we're playing.  Well, except for that one. 
[00:01:00]  But that's okay.  But you can't like them all.  That's obvious.  But as long as there's nothing silly.  No, nothing silly.  We'll make believe we love every song.  Okay.  Well, just stating the truth.  All right.  I mean, you can't honestly say, you know, you tune in your favorite radio station.  You honestly think the jock likes every song he plays?  Well, and they talk like this, they do.  That's kind of silly.  Hey, I like every song we're playing.  It's kind of silly to think that.  Yeah.  And I guess if you're in the business, it's sacrilegious to talk bad about the music you play. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  So there's a song in there that you don't really care for.  One or two, yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll try to figure them out.  No, no.  I'll try to figure them out.  All right.  You can try to figure out as we go along today.  You can play along at home.  Try to figure out which songs Opie doesn't like.  Listen for the sarcasm.  All right.  What do you want to do here?  There's a lot to do.  We're getting a ton of faxes and phone calls. 
[00:02:00]  People want to hear the William Shatner game analysis from the Jet Broncos.  Well, everybody's been doing game analysis.  You know, and they look at the game.  They see what the problems were, where the Jets went wrong.  It's been hashed and rehashed.  Maybe on the fan, you heard,  back in the man, dog.  How about that Jet team?  They deserve a lot of credit for their spectacular run that you had all season long.  Obviously, had quite a problem with the Broncos.  Are they still talking about the game over there, you think?  Oh, of course. 
[00:02:30]  Got to give Bill Parcells a lot of credit.  He's coming back for another season.  Bill Parcells obviously has to come back,  and he wants to go out a winner.  So he's got the team.  We can go all the different, maybe next year.  That's right, Maggie.  That's right, Maggie.  All right, listen.  We can make this our Jets break.  This group, is it Scott Van Dusen?  Yeah.  Is this the same Scott Van Dusen I worked with in Rochester?  You radio people.  You all know each other. 
[00:03:00]  You all show one big happy family.  No, I worked with a Scott Van Dusen in Rochester at WCMF.  Anyway.  Didn't I work with Seymour Dix back out in Frisco?  No, I believe it was 68.  Sure, that was Seymour Dix, wasn't it?  Was it the Seymour Dix?  No, no.  There was a Seymour Dix out of Missouri, I remember, at KL and Q.  And then there was a Seymour Dix out in Frisco and a Seymour Dix out in San Diego.  You know, the sad part is there's another Opie working in this business. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And this has been my stupid nickname since I was Ken.  It's not even a radio name.  Yeah, you got screwed.  I really did get screwed.  You picked the wacky radio name.  Opie!  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, I would have picked this one.  And then I have to be, my real name has to be Anthony, so people get confused going,  Oh, Opie and Andy, that's cute, it's a Mayberry thing.  Oh.  All right, would you like to hear the Jets song?  Yes.  I want to hear this.  This is about the Lost Sunday. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  As soon as you don't like it, tell me and we'll get rid of it.  All right.  I can almost remember the smell of that dream.  Not bad, not bad.  First time you told us that you've been in the Super Bowl soon.  Oh, he can sing.  Oh, that's a little rough. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a low blow. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Oh, and why is it a day at my heart's stadium?  Oh, and why is it a way to end your season?  Oh, yeah, better, but better.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, better, but better. 
[00:05:30]  Well, that was all right. 
[00:06:00]  It had potential.  They only had two days to write it, though.  I just wonder what David Coverdale's been up to.  All right, well, there you go.  All right, you want me to file this?  Yeah, you could file the Jets losing song.  We'll probably play it again, right?  Later on, I think.  Because it's really good?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, I'm sure all the people that suffered through watching the Jets lose really appreciate hearing that. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, so why don't you put it aside so we can play that?  All right.  All right.  Yeah, that'll stay right there.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday with ACDC, off the Razor's Edge, that is Money Talks.  This Razor's Edge CD, very, very good.  Very good.  It's overlooked by many rock stations around the country, unfortunately, but there's a bunch of ditties on this thing that are great songs for the radio, including Thunderstruck. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  You don't care about my little ACDC rap?  I'm looking, as you're talking, I'm looking at instant feedback.  I'm jotting some things down, Opie.  I'm very busy on this side of the console.  Sure you are.  What are you doing over there?  I was writing some stuff down.  Oh, for our Clinton bit that's coming up?  I mean, oops.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that could be, maybe. 
[00:07:30]  Something like that.  Okay.  All right.  Well, let's play the William Shatner from yesterday, if I can find it here.  Yeah.  I mean, we don't want to just, you know, pound the Jets' loss to death here, but William Shatner was in yesterday, and he analyzed the Jets' performance against the Broncos.  Unique analysis.  So check this out.  Greetings.  I have a few thoughts on the game, Opie, Anthony.  You would let me speak.  Okay. 
[00:08:00]  This John Elway is a lot like the Gorn, I find, with those huge teeth.  I believe if a couple of members of the Jets could have found some sulfur and diamonds and a bamboo tube and fashioned an impromptu cannon, they could have fired it at him, as I did against the Gorn.  Plus, Karen, being victory.  Tyrell Davis, much like the burrowing Horta made of rock, was able to burrow through solid rock with acid. 
[00:08:30]  Why didn't Parcells mind-meld with Tyrell, telling him they were on a mission of peace for the good of man?  That would have worked, I believe, in stopping Tyrell.  Well, how about Vinny Testaverde?  If only they could have implanted the Romulan cloaking device in him, rendering him invisible. 
[00:09:00]  Well, they could not see where he was passing the ball, only to become visible as he passes the ball.  Well, that seems illogical.  Why couldn't they get the Romulan cloaking device?  And finally, maybe if they would have defeated them as I defeated the Gamesters of Triskelion, with a battle to the death, with a morgue, thus freeing the enslaved thralls.  This could have worked. 
[00:09:30]  It's my analysis on the game.  Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.  Well, you make a lot of sense.  Oh, there he goes.  I kicked it.  Wow, he did make a lot of sense.  If only they could have fashioned a cannon and shot Elway with it like he did the Gorn.  It makes perfect sense.  You know, you have too much time with your hands.  America.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW, two for Tuesday with U2 from the Joshua Tree, Bullet the Blue Sky. 
[00:10:00]  By the way, my favorite CD of the 80s.  Is it?  Joshua Tree.  Not many great albums came out of the 80s.  No.  Appetite Destruction did.  Joshua Tree.  What is your favorite album of the 80s?  Of the 80s?  Would it be Kajagoogoo's Greatest Hits?  Uh, yes, yes.  Yeah, I couldn't get enough of Too Shy Shy.  That you had to buy the whole album?  Oh, yeah.  See if they had a follow-up hit?  Yeah.  Culture Club.  Culture Club was one of your favorite of mine.  One of your faves?  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  I think you were into that band, huh?  Just give me any 80s fag band.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm there, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At a man?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Goodie Two Shoes?  That fits you.  Of course.  You're a jackass today?  I'm just smart as you're all wound up.  I'm wound up and filled with sarcasm today.  Well, I think congrats are in order for Jimmy.  Yes. 
[00:11:00]  No matter how much we bitched about the evolution of the rock of New York.  Remember that little dark period that we had to go through?  Well, he won an air award.  Yes, he did.  It's an, what is it, artist in radio?  In radio or something like that.  Yeah.  It's truly an honor.  Right.  And Jimmy brought home the hardware for NEW.  Because he did a great job on it.  Yes.  You know?  He produced the whole thing.  Yeah.  All the cool sweepers and the news clips and the montages. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And it was very well produced.  And he walked away with the award.  We just didn't agree with the concept at the time.  No.  No.  Jimmy was rewarded for his hard work today.  And we want to congratulate him.  Congratulations.  All right.  We didn't get any awards.  We didn't even submit.  I don't think we'll be getting any awards.  We didn't even submit, though.  I know.  We don't submit to awards.  I know.  It's a big kiss-ass.  I hate awards.  I know.  We were voted runner-up Best Afternoon Drive Show in the country, though. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that funny?  I guess our peers.  It was in one of the trade magazines.  Well, I'm honored, Opie.  Did our peers feel that?  That came out December 18th, I think.  Yeah.  But we didn't get an award for that, because I guess we were runner-ups or something.  Runner-ups.  Always sloppy seconds for the Opie and Anthony show.  Who cares?  All right.  On line one, we got someone that has an observation about Star Trek.  Okay.  One of your favorite shows, Anthony.  Good.  Hi, N.E.W. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, N.E.W., is it just me, or did that doomsday machine look like a giant doobie?  A big doobie, yeah, and it was even burning kind of thing.  It was.  It had, like, you know, it had a live head, you know.  Yeah.  It was a little pinched down.  It looked like it might have been, you know, chewed on a little bit on the end.  But it was a big, fat doober.  And you said something the other day that just killed me, man, but I can't remember the friggin' name of it.  You remember Gummy the Dwarf from the, what was it, the Tholian Web? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  What drink did he offer Kirk?  Captain Kirk, have some Tranya.  Tranya.  Oh, my God.  How the hell do you remember that s***?  Tranya.  Tranya.  Well, listen, I got a work call, guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  The word of the day is...  Tranya.  Captain Kirk.  We are a lot alike.  Both proud of our ships. 
[00:13:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was Ron Howard's brother.  Yes.  What's his name?  Clint Howard.  Clint Howard.  He was a little fidget back then, and they put him in the spaceship.  And he's sitting in that chair, and he's...  With that big, huge forehead of his.  Oh, he had a shaved head and everything.  A lightbulb head that he's got working.  Yeah, this huge lightbulb head and these, like,  gnarly teeth, Captain Kirk.  I was testing you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Have some Tranya.  Love that show, damn it.  Hey, we want to say hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[00:14:00]  Checking in.  Yeah.  Up to the program this afternoon, we got the, uh, the Hummer Queen song here.  Oh, yeah.  For all the members.  And we are encouraging everyone out there to send in their Tuesday Night Hummer songs.  Oh, Opie, Opie.  People will never learn how to use the internet.  I got an email here from, uh, Joe.  He says, hey, guys, I listened last Friday.  It sounded like loads of fun.  But the pictures on the website are too small and do not do the event justice it deserves. 
[00:14:30]  He's talking about the Smash the Bronco thing we did Friday.  Yeah.  And see if you can enlarge the pics and repost them to the site.  Rock on.  Uh, Joe, those are what are called thumbnails.  See, they're a little preview of the picture that if you click on it, they get bigger.  Much bigger.  Yeah.  They look great on the website.  They really look good.  So, if you're online right now, go to www.wnaw.com.  Joe, you're a nut.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW.  The Rolling Stones, two for Tuesday. 
[00:15:00]  Monkey Man.  So, now Mick Jagger's claiming in the paper that he was never officially married to Jerry Hall.  Yeah.  That's cute.  Yeah.  Damn, Mick, banging all our broads.  Save some for the rest of us, will ya?  This guy is unbelievable.  Think she's going to get the money eventually?  Uh, she'll get something.  She wants 50 million.  50 million.  How does anyone rate that kind of change in a divorce settlement?  I don't get it.  I don't get it either. 
[00:15:30]  What is it like that?  Or the lawsuits that people bring up that, you know, I lost my, uh, my pinky, so I want  a million dollars.  Or, I want 50 million dollars.  Or you spill coffee on your lap.  Yeah.  Your fault, and you're suing for 10 million dollars.  Usually it's some old bag.  She, she's shaking while she's taking the lid off, and she spills it in her lap.  I think a younger woman should get more money if she spills hot coffee in her lap.  At least she's using it or something.  It's not like you're damaging anything that's being used, lady. 
[00:16:00]  Now, how dare you state that old people don't F.  Hey, I don't want to think about it.  Anytime that stupid Golden Girls show is on, and they're all talking about sex and how,  oh boy, I was with this man last night, and oh, we had a, oh, Rue McClenahan?  I want to think about that.  You know, we got to start doing our radio show from our car.  I, I guess we got to expose another one of our bits when we drive in.  Uh-oh.  Yoshi the Pork Man developed when we were driving into Manhattan. 
[00:16:30]  And we saw all the, uh, you know, Asian delivery guys and their bikes with their delivery, uh, basket and stuff.  Yeah.  That's where that, that bit developed, just coming into the city.  You're going to get into this.  Our new one is, when we're at, we're, we're just, we're just not meant for society.  We should be locked up.  But when we, when we stop at, uh, the lights in Manhattan, we look around and we, we just goof on every single person we see, first of all.  That's what everyone does.  And then when we see a really old lady, this is terrible, Anthony goes, you know, there was a time when she was hot. 
[00:17:00]  She went.  She was, she went.  Think she still goes?  Yeah, you can picture, you know, it's like 1910.  Yeah.  And she's just, you know, going to town.  She's a hot, you know, uh, chick living in Manhattan and then she goes.  Yeah.  But now she's really old and wrinkled up.  It's just like decrepit with the walker with the little spokes on them.  Like the four pronged walker, which is walking down the street with the training walker attached. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or she's in a little rascal scooter.  And then you just look and think like, man, maybe, you know, 1920.  She used to go.  Yeah.  There's a prohibition going on.  She goes to the speakeasies, you know, she's a flapper.  It's like, now look at her.  And she's like, Hey, she's a hot looking dame.  23 skidoo hubba hubba.  You know, and she's getting some.  Yeah.  And now it's just like, she's kind of walking down the street.  It's just a bad bit. 
[00:18:00]  Just, just horrible.  You know, you got to wonder.  Of course you wonder.  Not in a sexual way.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not looking at these old women thinking, uh, no hottie.  Just thinking, you know, in their past, which ones were like the whores and which ones.  No, because even now, you know, there are girls.  That's how far you go with the bed, too.  Well, there are girls that are.  You decide if, you know, if she was a virgin when she got married or if she was a slut and did everyone.  It's a poor old lady with a walker on the side of the road. 
[00:18:30]  It doesn't matter.  Look now.  There are women and girls, women that are, that are virtuous, you know.  And then there are whores.  It wasn't any different back then.  And you see an old woman with that funny hats that they wear and the big shellacked hairdos that they have done at the parlor every month.  And you wonder, you know, was she a whore?  Or was she one of the virtuous ones?  Do a lot of thinking on the way in.  Yeah, we keep ourselves entertained. 
[00:19:00]  Fax Line, 212-957-WNEW.  Chris, we get our best stuff from the faithful listeners.  Yes, we do.  Chris writes, I found some photos of Anthony's new crush.  I hope you enjoy them and have your crayons to color them all in.  What is it, coloring book pages?  Well, he sent seven pages from the Big Comfy Couch coloring book, Anthony.  Oh, man.  I didn't even know about this show until yesterday.  Hey, I like Alice in Court.  And now explain what the Big Comfy Couch show is all about. 
[00:19:30]  I've never seen it.  I saw her do a little appearance on Rosie O'Donnell the other day.  And she's a lunette, this clown.  She has pigtails.  Yeah, yeah.  And freckles and a clown nose.  And Anthony thinks she's hot.  Well, she's 25.  And out of makeup, she's really hot.  All right.  Well, Chris sent in the pages from the coloring book.  And there's your new girlfriend sitting on our cute, you know, comfy couch with her little comfy couch doll.  And underneath it says, let's get comfy, Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  How old is this guy?  Come on.  He sent you a coloring book page?  Yeah, and you're supposed to color these in.  Oh.  And then you got your new girlfriend.  She's on her big comfy couch.  And she's got her doctor gear on.  Yeah.  And she's got the scope on the comfy couch doll.  And underneath it says, I'd like to get naked and play doctor.  Now there's your hot girlfriend with her pigtails bending over the big comfy couch rearranging things.  Yeah.  And then underneath it says, let me tidy things up. 
[00:20:30]  Gee, I hope that there isn't some greasy looking perverted sicko standing behind me while I bend over here.  She's a dirty clown.  Our listeners have way too much time.  And then, this is brutal.  You got your brand new girlfriend in her clown get up with her comfy couch doll on the big letter F block.  Right.  She's on a block with the big letter F on it.  I wonder what this person wrote.  Anthony, F me, you big perverted clown loving pedophile.  Come on. 
[00:21:00]  She's 25 years old.  But she's playing an 8-year-old.  No, she's not.  She's playing a clown.  She's playing an 8-year-old.  Do you hear how she talks?  She is not.  Look at her.  Look at her.  I got pictures of her here out of makeup.  She's supposed to be a little girl on her comfy couch with her comfy couch little dolly.  I've never seen the comfy couch show.  Just because the actress is 25, she's playing an 8-year-old and you think she's hot.  I've never seen the comfy couch show.  I'm saying the girl, Allison Court, that plays Lunette the Clown is hot. 
[00:21:30]  Not Lunette the Clown.  I don't even know why I have to explain things like this.  All right.  There you go.  Thanks for sending that in.  Oh, wait.  Why am I throwing that away?  I'm sure you're going to want to color this in.  Of course, I'll be.  Yes.  I'm coloring it in now.  Yeah.  Here you go.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Bruce Springsteen.  Adam raised a cane and devil with the blue dress from the No Nuke soundtrack.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Getting some email here on the pictures that are up on the WNEW website. 
[00:22:00]  A little Jets promotion that we did on Friday.  That was a huge success.  We got front page of the record over the weekend.  Yeah.  And it was shown on TV all over the ball field.  It was pretty good.  Had a lot of people there.  And it was a party.  See, Jeff says, I've never seen a Bronco destroyed like that.  Excellent promo.  Can't wait to see the next sick idea you guys come up with.  We already have the next idea.  If you want to check out the pictures, they're on the NAW website. 
[00:22:30]  There's about 15 of them or so.  Yeah, I think so.  Our next idea, we want to start this concept where we go out every, I don't know, once a month or so.  Maybe a little longer than that.  Yeah.  And it's called Get Your Aggression Out on Friday or something like that.  It's tied into FU Friday.  Yeah.  To get your aggressions out, we're going to give you the opportunity to destroy certain things that might just piss you off.  Yes.  During life.  Now, we've partied in Manhattan.  We've taken the show to Jersey. 
[00:23:00]  We want to go to Long Island next.  Want to find a cool bar that has a cool happy hour.  Want to get everybody out there.  This is down the road.  We're not going to do it like this Friday, but maybe in a couple weeks or so or maybe in a month, whatever.  No, this was a good icebreaker because we're going to do a lot more.  We love being out there.  We love being out and about.  So, we want to get a bunch of pianos and have people smash that with sledgehammers because I think that would sound really wild on the radio.  A little sledgehammer concerto.  Yes.  And then we want...  Like chopsticks.  And then I want to challenge Anthony to a round of Tic Tac Rosie. 
[00:23:30]  Mm-hmm.  And it's a concept we came up with last night on the ride home.  I like it.  Big TVs.  Nine of them.  We need...  Set up like Hollywood squares.  Yes.  And then we just have Rosie on all the TVs.  Yes.  And me and you throw bowling balls at it and try to get a Tic Tac Toe.  Yes.  Because a bowling ball through a TV is just...  God, you've got to love how that looks and sounds.  Especially when the TV is plugged in. 
[00:24:00]  It's pretty fun.  It's got Rosie on there.  Yeah.  So, that's what we're trying to develop for the next road show.  Yeah.  Okay?  Stay tuned.  And if you have an idea, we listen to everyone.  Some of our best ideas come from you guys.  Yeah.  You know, you could either email us or send some instant feedback or you could fax us.  Just get a hold of us with your wacky ideas.  Thank you.  Okay?  We had an exclusive yesterday, Anthony.  Yes, we did.  We don't want to keep talking about the Jets' loss.  It's kind of sad.  The Giants fans are all laughing and saying, I told you so and all that. 
[00:24:30]  It hurts.  There's no need to get like that.  It hurts.  Yeah.  But we'll move on.  I guess.  Well, I can't follow the Knicks, especially if they sign Sprewell.  Ah, Sprewell.  Probably getting signed to the Knicks.  That's crazy.  They're going to give Jeff Van Gundy neck braces?  Big metal collar.  Big metal collars for every game. 
[00:25:00]  New York doesn't need a championship that bad that they have to go out and get Sprewell.  A thug.  Another reason I'm not following basketball this year, even though I know every move that  is happening in the NBA, I'm that pathetic.  As much as I try not to pay attention.  And now I've got the Islanders.  That's my team.  Oh.  Have they lost like, what, 250 games in a row at this point?  What happened?  Start of the season off on the right foot, and now they've lost, I think, 89 games in 
[00:25:30]  a row, Anthony.  I don't know.  Maybe they're afraid that scoreboard's going to fall on their head at the Coliseum.  That's what's happening.  That's right, remember?  It's a Knicks scoreboard.  Yeah, they didn't even want to play at the Coliseum.  They want a new place to play because they said the scoreboard isn't safe.  It's going to come crashing down on the ice.  So do you think that maybe the team is too busy looking up instead of playing the game?  That's it.  If you were looking where you're supposed to be passing and shooting the puck, instead  of going, oh God, is it going to fall this time as you skate under the scoreboard, 
[00:26:00]  I say give them a new place.  And they'll do better?  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  But I'm going to state right now, Islanders, my team, my team.  Just so in years to come.  So in 10 years when they maybe make it back into the cup.  You're not a bandwagon jumper.  Right.  You guys will know that I've always followed the bastards.  Okay.  All right.  Anyway, speaking of the Jets game, this was an exclusive for us in our show.  Very proud, but it's a national story now.  There was a fan at the game on Sunday at Mile High Stadium. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And he got hurt really, really bad.  A Jets fan, yeah.  And who does he call?  Does he call Larry King?  Does he call CNN?  Does he call ESPN?  No, he called us, Anthony.  I know.  It's two for Tuesday with Aerosmith on the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW, Last Child and What It Takes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  How are you?  Very well.  Once again, I want to say hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Being inducted as we speak.  And to the people that aren't members yet, good luck to you tonight. 
[00:27:00]  Good luck.  We got another one of our Tuesday Night Hummer Club songs on the way.  Yeah.  It's a fan favorite, the Blow Me song.  Oh, yeah.  You hardly even know me.  Haven't played that in a couple weeks, so stick around for that.  So?  Um, I think we got a guy on line six here that has some observations about you.  Me?  Yeah.  What do I do?  The faithful listeners, they listen very closely and they pick up on things, Anthony.  Okay.  Hi, Andy W.  Opie, Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  It's Paul.  How are you?  Hey, Paul.  I'm worried you guys are getting into the pedophile stuff.  You started talking about that and this is what I thought of.  School buses, Anthony Sportswood.  Comfy couch, Anthony Sportswood.  Teenage tennis players, Anthony Sportswood.  And which one of you were into the Olsen twins?  Uh, Anthony.  I just said we were six.  Sportswood.  I just said we were six years away from being able to have a legitimate threesome with the Olsen twins. 
[00:28:00]  I have never made any pedophile jokes.  You said that O.J. Simpson's daughter used to be hot.  And then she got fat.  Come on.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  I did see that.  You guys are going under the surface.  The FCC is coming after you.  Come on.  All right.  Well, let's get off the subject.  I just want to wish Jody Sweeten a happy 17th birthday.  The blonde girl from Full House.  One year to go. 
[00:28:30]  You're a dirty man.  All right, man.  We got to go.  Okay.  Thanks, Paul.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, one year.  Happy birthday, Jody.  You're 18 in one year.  I saw some new pictures of her somebody sent me.  Really?  Yeah.  There's a girl out there that.  She's a dirty girl.  There's a girl out there that loves when you do the dirty girl voice.  Yeah.  Where's that instant feedback?  We're getting a lot of instant feedback today.  Thank you, people.  Jackie from Ramsey.  She goes, I love the you're a dirty girl, aren't you voice. 
[00:29:00]  It gives me the chills every time I hear it.  Love you, Anthony.  Thank you, Jackie.  Jackie out there in Ramsey.  Oh, you're such a dirty girl, aren't you, Jackie?  You're a dirty, filthy girl.  You like it dirty, don't you?  I bet.  Yes, you do.  I'm watching you.  It's like the perverted Bob Ross.  I'm going to put some lizard and crimson on your ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is how I work my brush. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, look how I paint mushrooms.  I dip this in the brown.  There, it's a mushroom.  It's a dirty mushroom, isn't it?  My big afro looks like a 70s porno film, doesn't it?  Yeah.  My God.  Oh, damn.  Bob Ross is dead.  Yeah.  I used to have so much fun just watching him paint. 
[00:30:00]  It's like, wasn't that fun?  It's like, how the hell did he do that?  Yeah.  Like a half hour, he would do this mint painting.  You couldn't even fathom being able to paint like that.  And he's like, yeah, you just pick up a spatula, you know.  Now get your mixer from the kitchen and it's beautiful.  It's a mountain.  Yeah.  If I did, it would look like I used a spatula and a mixer.  It makes a forest.  It makes you feel retarded, like you can't do this.  Yeah.  Look, we just dip my big afro into some liquid white. 
[00:30:30]  And I'm just going to push my head into this canvas.  There.  Look at those buffy clouds.  Isn't that great?  Let me get my beard.  I'm going to dip my beard in this brown color.  There's a happy little bush.  I made it out of my beard.  That's where the rabbits live.  And my big hairy ass.  Oh, here we go.  My big hairy ass.  I'm going to sit in a little bit of this blue, this aqua blue. 
[00:31:00]  I'm going to make a river.  Here we go.  There it is.  I just took my big hairy afro ass, sat it in the blue.  Look at that.  It's got a little water hole, isn't it?  I made a watering hole.  Look at that little cave where the little snakes live.  I never use regular painting utensils.  Paint with a brick.  What else is going on?  Well, I see in the paper, Bill Clinton, Opie. 
[00:31:30]  Always a favorite.  You want to save the Clinton bit?  Save it?  I think we gave the listeners a lot this break here.  You're a pisser.  I think we should let them just kind of hang out and sit back and reflect on what we just gave them, Anthony.  Coming up next, we'll be talking about Bill Clinton.  Got to spread out the bits a little bit here.  Wow.  What, are you listening to Gary Waltz?  All right.  No comment. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  And also on the way, is Corky Steinbrenner really making an appearance today?  Hey, where's Black Earl?  Black Earl.  We need to talk to Black Earl in a little while here.  About?  I was just reading all the instant feedback while the commercials were playing.  Yeah.  And everyone's checking out the pictures from the Smash the Bronco thing we did Friday at Manny's and Minaki.  Yes.  And everyone loved the pictures.  Check them out for yourself on the NAWD website.  But all the faithful listeners are sitting there going, where's the picture of the girl that flashed her boobs on top of the Bronco? 
[00:32:30]  The girl got on top of the Bronco and flashed the entire crowd.  She whipped them out.  It was great.  And she swears she's going to be the one that does it on the Today Show for the $1,000, by the way.  Yeah, that's what she said at first.  And we're like, well, why don't you give these people here a preview?  And, of course, everyone just was like, wow.  They freaked out.  Yeah.  We got to talk to Black Earl.  It was his job to get the photo of the girl.  He got every single, every other photo but that one.  I want to find out what happened.  You think he was shaking too much with the camera or something? 
[00:33:00]  Maybe.  That was, as my brother likes to say, Major Dairy.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday.  Metallica from Garage Inc.  Whiskey in the jar.  And until it sleeps from load.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Now, Anthony, you got the pictures.  Up and running.  Yeah.  WNEW.com.  Mm-hmm.  Got 15 pictures from our Smash the Bronco thing we did Friday at Manny's and Minaki. 
[00:33:30]  Good pics.  You see the Bronco in various states of being destroyed by the people that were down there and a nice group shot of all the people on the overturned Bronco with weapons and things they used to destroy the Bronco.  But some people are emailing us, some, just about every single one of our listeners, there's a picture that's mysteriously missing.  Picture mysteriously absent.  Unsolved mysteries.  Earl took the pictures, but when they made it to the website, the pictures of the boobs were mysteriously absent. 
[00:34:00]  Hmm.  We went to Earl.  Well, we got Black Earl in the studio.  What happened, Earl?  And you see, I have to separate Black and Earl because a lot of people think I say Black Girl.  It's Black Earl.  Black Girl.  Now, da-da-da.  Earl was in charge of taking the pictures.  Earl was in charge of our whole broadcast at Manny's now that I think about it. 
[00:34:30]  So maybe we shouldn't write him too hard here.  But it was one of his jobs to take all the pictures.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  What happened when the girl was showing her boobs on top of the Bronco?  Now, you told me on air, and you can hear it on the air say, Earl, take a picture.  So I got the camera ready, took the picture.  Now, when we downloaded the shot, now, the digital camera isn't as quick as a regular camera.  Oh, right.  You're not going to get like, nothing like that.  Yes, it's very slow.  Very slow.  So I took one shot.  So I figure if it's a slow camera, you would wait until you have visual boobage and then snap it. 
[00:35:00]  Okay, go.  So I took the shot, and when we downloaded it to look at the picture, she was only halfway up.  Oh, gosh.  So why didn't you wait until you saw the brights shining in your...  Well, that's just it.  I'm thinking, like...  You were anticipating, weren't you?  Like a regular camera.  I was...  It was just bad time.  Oh, yeah.  Earl, you let us all down.  He lost the shot.  I lost the shot.  That prize shot. 
[00:35:30]  That was the only shot we cared about.  Who cares about the stupid Bronco that smashed?  We got 50 shots of the smashed Bronco.  The one picture of the girl that exposed herself to the crowd with the huge globes.  And it's Karen, right?  Karen's online?  Maybe she'll recreate the scene for us.  Karen.  Yes?  We don't have a picture of your lovely boobs on our website.  I'm sorry.  Earl wasn't fast enough with the camera.  See, and I did it for a good amount of time, so...  Yeah, you did.  And you started jumping up and down. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  They were moving.  Earl, you could have got 20 shots.  I know.  20.  We just needed one picture of it.  I was a little busy.  Digital camera doesn't go fast.  It's like he's using a Kodak Brownie, like one of those old original cameras.  What?  Would you have, like, the flash powder on the stick?  Wait a minute.  I'm...  Come on, Earl.  How long did it take to reload?  Oh, my...  My batteries were going...  Batteries.  Earl's underneath the big cloth.  You know how you have to pull the... 
[00:36:30]  Like a 19th century photographer.  You've got to pull the rag over your head.  Smile.  Push the plunger.  I like playing 19th century photographer when I go out on weekends.  Go up behind a...  Go up behind a girl and pull the dress up.  Smile.  Take a pull.  Film's got to be changed.  Well, Karen, we don't have a picture of you, but we have 20 other pictures from our event this past Friday.  Yeah, I know.  I look.  What the heck is wrong with the phone today?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah, well, maybe one of the next things we do, you could come down and we could get a recreation or something. 
[00:37:00]  I would so be there.  Or maybe you could come down to the studio tomorrow and we'll take a few shots.  Or that.  I can do that.  And we could have them on our website by 4 o'clock tomorrow.  I can so do that.  Because so many people want to see what your boobs look like.  I'm sure.  And there's a big argument going on.  A lot of people thought that only one of your nipples were pierced.  No.  Two.  Both.  Both.  See?  Most people only saw the one.  Both.  And was there a tat? 
[00:37:30]  Yes, there was.  Okay.  A butterfly tattoo.  See, we have to do this all from memory, unfortunately.  From memory.  Well, it was a little busy.  I think the best was the chair.  You had no problem taking pictures of all the guys.  No, stop it.  Yeah, the group shot.  The group shot.  That's a nice picture, you know.  Yeah.  But, you know, we don't have your boobs.  I'm highly insulted.  All right.  Well, talk to Rick.  We'll try to set some up for maybe tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  Cool.  Because our perverted listeners would love to see you.  And so would you guys, I'm sure. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, no.  We don't like that at all.  Oh, please.  Whatever.  We're professionals.  This is just for our listeners.  Yeah, we're doing it for our listeners.  Yeah.  That's about it.  All right?  Like you didn't enjoy it.  Anyway, okay.  So, what are the odds of you doing this for the Today Show thing?  Oh, they're so good.  I can tell you that.  They're so good.  Really?  It's a matter of picking a day.  All right.  Well, that money's still on the line.  First girl shows her boobs during the Today Show.  And it has to say Opie and Anthony, right?  Yeah.  That would be nice.  Or we'll accept any W. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Opie and Anthony would be nice, though.  All right.  Or op and acc.  You know, something like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on for Rick.  Okay.  All right.  There she goes, Karen.  Off and running.  Yes.  All right.  Clinton's State of the Union address tonight.  Care.  Why is it on 50 channels?  I don't know.  They list all the channels his address is going to be on.  Couldn't we just pick two?  Maybe CNN and Channel 2?  No, because they all have to show it so that they have their anchor after tell you what he said.  But you heard the president speak of the economic state of the blah, blah, blah. 
[00:39:00]  But I find it weird that HBO scheduled Boogie Nights on at the same time.  You're saying?  Yeah.  Same time as the State of the Union address.  You can watch Boogie Nights.  Boogie Nights.  On HBO.  That's great.  You can see one or the other.  Well, it's another night of Tomb Raiders 3 for me, I guess.  You're addicted, aren't you?  Yeah, of course I am.  Tomb Raiders.  I do the PlayStation thing. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't...  And I've been reading about Tomb Raiders 3 and I finally got into it and I've been playing  for, I don't know, 20 straight hours now.  See?  I take a break to come in here to do the radio show.  You found one that you got addicted to.  Yes.  Now, how long is the longest you have spent online or on the PlayStation playing Tomb Raider?  Um, eight hours.  Eight hours.  Eight hours.  And you were laughing at me for ten.  Eight hours before the jet game.  And then another four after the jet game.  Remember him laughing at me for spending ten hours playing Half-Life? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And you're like, oh my God, that's crazy.  Eight is fine.  Ten, now you're crazy.  Hey, man, I had to figure out, you know, what to do with Lara.  I agree.  Gotta get Lara through the jungle.  There's tigers coming at me and stupid monkeys that are grabbing my med packs and stuff.  Now, you, I found the shotgun.  I'm blowing away the monkeys.  They tell you not to blow away those stupid monkeys, but I'm blowing them away.  And shoot the monkeys.  They tell you where to go.  Well, yeah, but...  They guide you.  It's fun when you see them explode, though. 
[00:40:30]  Isn't it, though?  Yes.  Now, uh...  And then I found the river and then I had to jump in and now I'm underwater in these tunnels  and I popped out in this ancient temple that's filled with water.  With waterfalls and I don't know what to do now.  This is only the first quarter of the game.  See, you're hooked.  I am hooked.  I've, uh...  I think I've settled down a little.  I've calmed down.  Yeah.  With my computer game.  Yeah.  I think, oh, yeah, yeah.  Half-Life, I'm only on there for 12 hours. 
[00:41:00]  As a matter of fact, uh, Optima Cable went to my house earlier today.  Uh-huh.  Cable modem.  Whoa.  For my multiplayer, uh, habit.  Wow.  I'll beat you people that I play with online.  I'll be kicking your ass tonight.  Yeah.  And I got Metal Gear on the side waiting to play.  Do you?  That's the next one.  When I get done with, uh, Tomb Raiders 3.  Metal Gear's good, man.  Yeah, with Snake.  Yeah.  Snake Rocks.  Also, uh, new Duke Nukem coming out soon.  Yeah, I gotta play that one as well. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  So they're just piling up in my house.  Oh, yeah, there's plenty of death and destruction for everybody.  It's fun.  You know, I...  Speaking of PlayStation, I tried, uh, I don't know, John Madden's NFL 99 or whatever.  Yeah.  And I...  I don't know how you figure out how to play a football game with the PlayStation.  Yeah!  Woo!  Yeah, 102.7 WNEW with Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  That's becoming the theme song for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, I believe.  It's very appropriate.  And I like the other one as well. 
[00:42:00]  Which one?  From the Hummer Queen that was sent in to us.  That's a good one.  It's a quickie.  Sure, sure.  Let's listen to it real fast.

Alright  What else we got, Anthony?  Well, I'm looking through the paper, Opie  I see Joey D  The Yankee Clipper  Man, who would have figured on this one? 
[00:43:30]  Well, they were saying he was pretty much dead  That's it?  They were using words like very dire situation  Would you like some peanuts?  Last rites were given  Oh, no thank you  Okay  You're an idiot  Sorry  I'm just trying to get my workbook out here  And I noticed I had some peanuts  The family signed a do not resuscitate order  Remember that?  It was really bad  And then the next day would come by  And Jolton Joe's making a comeback  Yes  He's looking good  Yes  He was caught in a rundown between life and death  And he was running back towards life 
[00:44:00]  And then the next day  Oh, my God  He's going back towards death  So then finally he said  Hey  You know  Knock it off  Wait until this pans out  And then  Yeah  Just shut up  No reports  No more reports on my health  Leave me alone  And then a month goes by  And it hits the news yesterday  That he's out of the hospital  He was released  Yeah  Yeah  84 years old  And not only that  George Steinbrenner  Corky Steinbrenner  Has come out and said  That he will probably throw out the first pitch 
[00:44:30]  No  Next season  Yogi  Remember he had  He had made up with Yogi Berra  Mm-hmm  Because everyone thought  That Joe D was going to drop dead  So then Yogi would throw out the pitch  Yogi would be  You know  Yeah  The surviving  The man  Yankee  Whole time  Great  Right  So now it looks like  Yogi's going to catch  Joe D's pitch  Is that what they're saying though?  Yeah  Come on  I'm not kidding  You read that somewhere?  Yeah  It's right here in New York  God 
[00:45:00]  I want to see that  I know  Come on  He can't  Yogi can't crouch down  In that position anymore  Yogi  Not crouching  But you think Joe  He's going to have to stand  Two feet away  From him  I mean we all love  Joe D  The jolting  The jolt and jolt  Yes  But I mean  84 years old  He was  Saying hi to St. Peter  A couple of weeks ago  I don't know if he's going to be  Winging that ball  You know?  Maybe we could give him  A wiffle ball 
[00:45:30]  That might work too  But of course  Corky  Steinbrenner  Once again  Very emotional  Now is this an actual quote  That we can find  In the paper  Anthony?  Of course  Where is it?  It's page  Four  Of Newsday  It's got  George Steinbrenner  It's all bold letters  And he's saying  About the recovery  That Joe D made  This is one of the greatest moments  In Yankee history  You might remember his previous quotes 
[00:46:00]  This is the best team  In baseball  Getting this trophy from you  Makes it even better  From a man I've known  For 20 some odd years  20 some odd years  So what is his latest quote again?  I gotta hear that again  This is one of the greatest moments 
[00:46:30]  In Yankee history  So Corky  Corky's very happy  That Joe D  Will probably be thrown out  The first pitch  I think we're all happy  Very happy  Oh no  Here he comes  Corky Steinbrenner  Very happy  Yeah  Joe D  To have a  Football game  Champion  99  Season  Joe D  Joe D  Joe D  Where's my conduct?

[00:55:30]  See ya  76 years jog  Happy birthday to ya  Alright here's the deal  Cause we gotta play these spots  Uh  Stephen Lynch is coming in tomorrow  Our pal  If you're a faithful listener to the show  You know Stephen Lynch  He sang the Special Olympics song  He sang  He sung the Gerbil song  He sung the  Sang  Sang song  Sorry  Sing did it  He sing did  He sing did  That all those goof songs  That we've been playing for the last three months  He's coming in with a whole batch of new songs tomorrow 
[00:56:00]  It's gonna be very exciting  You must be 21 or older to win  It's all from WNUW and your friends at Zoom.com  Anthony can we hear your cute little Zoom.com voice one more time?  Five Thousand Dollars  Come on they tell me  And I do  It's opening  We're just about out the door  Tony Pig up next  Tony  Hey  Tony  Babes  What's up Tony  How you doing  Hey Popeye  Love you guys  What's going on bro? 
[00:56:30]  Nothing  Are you gonna rock tonight?  I'm gonna rock my socks off  And yours too  But you know Regis is asking about you  Uh oh  When you gonna get him on the show?  Um  Yeah we gotta get him on  We were supposed to have him on about a month ago  He's a mad man  Then something happened  Is his shoulder okay from Brian Leach's shot the other morning?  I saw that  Yeah I haven't asked him but it looked like it hurt  Brian Leach was taking shots at Regis  Regis in full goalie attire  Except for shoulder pads  He had no shoulder pads  But no one knew that  And Brian Leach takes the final shot 
[00:57:00]  And nails Regis in the shoulder  And all of a sudden Regis drops his glove and his stick  And lifts his mask up and goes  I don't have any pads  And you could hear the hush over the crowd  They were freaking  You could hear the thunk when you hit him too  Yeah  Just nailed him in the shoulder  And Brian Leach  I don't know  Regis is a tough guy  Yeah  I'm telling you he's a very tough guy  But Brian used maybe like 30% of his power  And still nailed Regis right in the blade  Could have went right through his arm if he went 100%  No bruise this morning though he said 
[00:57:30]  Oh good  He wasn't black and blue  Well tell Regis we said hi  How about the one where Stone Cold Steve Austin  From WWF Wrestling was on  He loves Stone Cold Steve Austin  And they got in like a little goof play wrestling thing  Because Stone Cold can like snap him in half  He hurt him  Yeah he spun around and hit him in the nose  With his arm accidentally  And Regis grabbed his nose  He's like ah  And Stone Cold's like  Hey what's the matter  I get you in the snout  I thought that was great  In the snout  Opened up a can of whoop-ass 
[00:58:00]  On you Regis Philbin  And that's the bottom line  Cause Stone Cold said so  We want to stay  Can we do another hour?  Would you do it?  Really?  Yeah well you know how Gary enjoys when we stay late  Yeah  Does Gary like that?  I would love to do it  I'm not sure  Some days he likes it  And other days he wishes we would  Not come in at all  So  Even start at three  Right  Well tomorrow  Thanks Tony  We'll see you next on the radio 
[00:58:30]  Okay  Alright man  Stay tuned  Tomorrow we got Stephen Lynch  Our buddy  Our pal  Who comes up with all the goop songs  That you've come to know and love  Yes  Can't wait  He's got a couple songs tomorrow  He's got a song about hermaphrodites  Is that true?  That's a great little subject for a ditty  And he's got a song about kittens  Alright  Kill a kitten or something like that  And  Get the phones ringing  And a cute little song about a priest  Right?  Oh  Sure it's touching  I can't wait  He's our  I think he's  Could be our favorite guest  He is 
[00:59:00]  He's right up there  Between him  Mark Golan from Maxim  And  Lewis Black from  Economy Central  Yeah  Matter of fact  That's the only guest we have  Yeah that's true  That's about it  Chased everybody else away  Well we say no to everyone else  Because if you don't get the vibe in here  We don't want you in here  You bring the energy down man  That's right  Yeah  Alright  Tony's on the list too  He's allowed to come in at any time  Yeah you made our list Tony  Oh cool  You're good energy man  Oh Earl  You know Lewis Black is an old friend of mine  Lewis is great  He's a great guy  He's coming in soon I think 
[00:59:30]  Next Thursday or something like that  Alright  Andrea wanted to know if she was on the list  Andrea  She's quiet when she comes in here  Yeah  I don't know  You know something  We gotta draw the line  No  What?  She gives us the cool music to play  We'll have to discuss her  It's gonna turn into everybody  It's just like the bomb shelter episode of Happy Days  How big is the list?  And then before you know it  Fonzie's coming with his motorcycle  Well  Well yeah  There's three people on the list  That are allowed to come in during the show Tony 
[01:00:00]  I'm honored  It's Black Earl  Ben the Fag  And the Hummer Queen  Those are the only three  You've heard that about Ben already?  Took me a long time to figure that one out  So those are the three people that are allowed to walk in while we're doing our thing  If they don't wreck the energy or the chemistry or the feel of the room  There are other people  They come in here and they suck the air right out of here  People can inadvertently ruin the energy just by having to conduct business while we're on the air  That's the Andrea thing  Right  If she wants to come in just to hang out, that's one thing 
[01:00:30]  But if it's business oriented, energy down the toilet  I say Andrea is allowed to come in, Anthony  Okay  As long as she's not conducting business  She wants to come and hang  She's a good hang  It's nothing personal  It's strictly business  True  But we have a list outside the door now  We locked the door at 3 o'clock  And we have a velvet rope  And Black Earl stays out there  And he checks the list to see if you're allowed to come in or not  And that's how it's going to be for now on 
[01:01:00]  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Alright </pre>
