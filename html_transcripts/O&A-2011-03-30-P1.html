<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton joking about their controversial past and FCC violations, immediately establishing a vulgar and sexually suggestive tone.  They discussed a turkey burger and a bizarre tangent about roasted chickens.  The hosts then announced upcoming guests: Colin Quinn, Norm MacDonald, and Brock Lesnar.  A significant portion of the show focused on a video from Andy Levy showing a Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) crew removing a basketball hoop, with the homeowner's wife attempting to prevent its removal.  The hosts vehemently criticized DelDOT, the police officer's demeanor, and the perceived overreach of local government, speculating on the motives of the complaining neighbor.  They engaged in a lengthy discussion about permits, regulations, and bureaucratic absurdity, playing audio from the heated exchange captured on video.

The show then transitioned to a video showing a man removing basketball hoops from a white neighborhood, leading to a discussion about racial bias and noise complaints.  This segued into a previous tree removal dispute and contrasting views on "tree-huggers," contrasted with their own redwood bar top.  A preview of Jim Norton's pre-recorded segment, "Jim Norton Hates Trees," was played, showcasing his intense dislike of trees. The hosts then revisited a past discussion about the movie *Up in the Air* with Danny McBride, playing audio clips to highlight their inconsistent opinions.  A humorous discussion about t-shirt folding techniques ensued, comparing different methods. A listener called in with a rumour about Eric Clapton's laundromat habits.  The show again announced Colin Quinn, Norm MacDonald, and Brock Lesnar as guests.  Further discussions included President Obama's NYC visit and motorcades, a news story about a morbidly obese man fused to a chair, and a story about a Staten Island man setting fire to his ex-girlfriend's door with feces.  This segment ended with a discussion about racial slurs and stereotypes, particularly about Asian drivers, just as Colin Quinn entered the studio.

Colin Quinn, discussing his Broadway show and upcoming HBO special (premiering April 9th), became the focal point.  Jim Norton recounted attending Quinn's HBO taping, sharing crude jokes.  They discussed Quinn's career journey and humorous anecdotes about avant-garde theater and off-track betting.  Nick DiPaolo's absence from Quinn's show led to insults exchanged between Opie and DiPaolo, and Anthony shared his experience attending DiPaolo's show.  The hosts expressed their amusement (and disgust) with Chip Chipperson.  The missing Bronx Zoo cobra became a recurring topic, with a snake handler (John Brennan) from Hicksville, Long Island, joining the discussion, leading to numerous crude jokes. Anthony shared a story about a past band experience involving blackface makeup and joked about suing the Naked Cowboy.  The hosts reminisced about Sandy Kane propositioning Opie and his offensive response to her rejection.  A significant portion of the show focused on nostalgic stories about Long Island bars and nightlife in the 1980s, including encounters with celebrities like Robbie Krieger.  They mentioned a Facebook page dedicated to 80s Long Island clubs and reiterated Brock Lesnar's upcoming interview, with Norton expressing his obsessive preparation.

The show continued with more discussion about Colin Quinn's autograph acquisition methods, including "extortion" anecdotes involving encounters with Ellen Barkin, Robert De Niro, and Snoop Dogg.  They discussed Quinn's HBO special, "Long Story Short," and his upcoming comedy festival appearances.  The conversation included stories about Quinn's interactions with Robert De Niro and his wife, a violent recurring incident at a Hamptons diner, and a lengthy bit about photos of Ava Braun with Hitler.  Norm MacDonald arrived late, causing playful frustration.  The conversation then switched to MacDonald's new Comedy Central sports show and his Twitter habits. Kevin Farley briefly appeared.  The discussion flowed to aging, mortality, and the differences in comedy over the years, with stories about Redd Foxx and LaWanda Page. Chip Chippitino made brief appearances.

The final segment focused on life insurance difficulties, stemming from Norm MacDonald's medical history and his struggles to obtain a policy.  MacDonald recounted a significant gambling loss, culminating in throwing $60,000 into the ocean. He detailed his intense reactions to bad luck in blackjack. The arrival of Brock Lesnar caused chaos as fans rushed for photos.  Once settled, Lesnar discussed his altercation with The Undertaker, clarifying it wasn't planned for WrestleMania. He talked about his transition from wrestling to MMA, the physical demands, the backstabbing nature of wrestling, and a serious health scare with diverticulitis. He discussed his recovery, his role on *The Ultimate Fighter*, his hunting, and his firearm collection.  Lesnar demonstrated a leg lock submission hold on Opie, showcasing his skills.  Colin Quinn made a brief appearance to promote his HBO special.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show?  Yeah, the crazier, the better. Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable. Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fucker. Have a good time. What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  How's everybody doing today? Grand, I hope.  Yeah, we're doing all right.  Is it hump day?  It's whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, that's what we called it.  Good old whip-em-out Wednesday.  Remember that?  I still tasted a turkey burger right last night.  I ate a place right by the corner from us.  It's a new place.  Turkey Burger Emporium?  Ted's Turkey Burger Emporium?  No, that place burned down.  It did?  It really did.  Hamburger fuckers opened.  And they think they had something to do with it.  Is it the healthy place?  It's like a little market.  They have some good...  A little market?  Why are you talking in code?  Are you Bangladesh? 
[00:02:00]  Where were you?  It's on 65th Street.  65th Street?  Oh, I thought you showed it to me.  Oh, the supermarket?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You got a turkey burger.  You got a turkey burger at a supermarket?  It's a pre-cooked thing, like in Jubilee.  Oh, okay.  I like when they do that.  They have little chickens on a spit.  I hate that.  I was so bad for the chickens.  Ah, fuck, I'm that delicious.  I always talk to them as they're going around.  How are you?  I'll get to you in a second.  How are you?  Is that...  You're trying to make it fun for me?  Is that fun?  Yeah.  Hey, are you yelling wee or are you screaming because you're being burned alive?  I can't hear you. 
[00:02:30]  Do you need some suntan lotion?  Yeah.  You look very hot in there.  Baste you.  Fucking stupid chickens.  Fuck them.  You need some FPF 14,000.  All right.  FPF.  What is it?  SFP.  SPF.  Whatever.  HIV.  No, no, no.  SPF?  SPF.  Jimmy's used to rubbing HIV on the girls.  No, I'm not.  They don't get a tan, but they do get some dark spots on them. 
[00:03:00]  Wow, that was record time.  Yeah, we're off and running.  Actually, he's still playing in the background.  I know.  AIDS jokes.  Really fast because this show is going to move real quickly today.  Colin Quinn at eight.  Nice.  Norm MacDonald at nine.  Yeah, Norm.  And then the great Brock Lesnar at 930.  Very cool.  There's a nice buzz around here that we're going to have Brock on.  A cavalcade of stars.  Oh, yeah.  So we've got to get all our other crap out of the way before the guests start arriving.  All our bullshit and shenanigans. 
[00:03:30]  Are we ready for our guests?  I think.  Are we ready?  I'm prepared.  You're prepared?  Jimmy's always prepared for the likes of a Brock Lesnar, of course.  Yeah.  Well, he had a file.  The Brock Lesnar interview file, remember.  That's the file.  From yesterday.  Colin Quinn's a no-brainer.  And I mean that literally.  He has no brain.  And Norm.  Norm.  Norm's great.  Saw his special.  It's fantastically funny.  Is it funny?  Oh, God.  Very funny.  Yeah, and he's doing a sports thing for Comedy Central.  Doing a sports thing for Comedy Central.  And he's a new Twitter sensation. 
[00:04:00]  He sure is.  Him and the Cobra.  Yeah.  I was watching the Oscars that was a couple of months ago, I guess, when that was on.  And our own Travis, I know he had gotten it from somebody else.  And maybe even Andy Levy.  I'm not sure.  But Travis had gotten it from somebody and tweeted how funny Norm's tweets were.  And I was like, let me follow this Norm MacDonald.  I didn't know he was tweeting.  And I was reading them during the Oscars, and they were hysterical.  Absolutely.  And now he's been the king of Twitter since. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That Andy Levy is a good one to follow, because I think Andy has no social life whatsoever.  Yes.  And I don't think he sleeps.  So he's perfect for Twitter.  He's all-knowing.  He is.  He keeps up to date with everything happening on the news, because he works for Red Eye.  He's on Red Eye on Fox weekdays at 3 a.m. here on the East Coast.  And midnight on the West Coast.  I'll be on tonight.  Oh, you're on tonight.  Nice.  I was on...  I'm going on vacation. 
[00:05:00]  So I got the call.  I'll be on April 21st on the Red Eye.  So stay tuned, because that's a good one.  Even better than Jimmy.  Well, shit.  They're writing that down right now.  No!  Set your DVRs, people.  They're writing it down right now.  Put a cassette in your VCR.  May check the tracking.  Top load.  You need to pull the VCR out first.  Yeah.  Top loader.  Get your top loader out.  Speaking of Andy Levy, he turned me on to a video yesterday, and I just turned Anthony on to the video. 
[00:05:30]  And then Anthony sort of just turned Jimmy on to the video, even though Jimmy hasn't seen the video.  But Jimmy is very pissed off already without seeing the video.  The story annoyed me when I read the story.  I think I got your tweet, actually.  Wait till you see this fucking video.  Yeah, you have to see the video.  I tweeted it somewhere on my Opie Radio Twitter.  I don't know how far down.  But it's basically out of Delaware.  Real quick, without looking at anything, how long ago was Reagan shot?  Go.  30 years ago.  You looked right at the TV. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't feel like playing today.  I looked right over your head and it said 30 years.  I know.  I'm sorry.  That's why I prefaced it without looking at anything, except the TV that said that.  You should have went, um, like you were thinking for a second.  Know what happened, though?  As soon as you said that, it made me look.  You were already looking.  Like, something made me just look.  I didn't.  I'm sorry.  For some reason, I don't think that shit's that long ago.  I'm sorry.  You played my silly games.  I should have played your silly game.  I couldn't help myself.  I looked right over your head.  Next time, I'm looking straight down at the answer. 
[00:06:30]  I didn't mean to.  No, that's fucked up, man.  30 years ago.  That went by pretty quickly.  I was 11?  God damn.  God damn.  I was 25?  And we lost, uh, Ferraro, huh?  Did we even talk about her dying?  No.  She had blood cancer.  It's a horrible cancer.  That doesn't sound like a good one to have, huh?  That doesn't sound like something they could just replace.  That's kind of heinous.  There is no God.  You can't filter your blood out?  Yeah, you can't just, like, do surgery on each individual blood cell. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  Oh, there's a little tumor on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me cut that off.  Only 86 trillion to go.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of surgeries.  Your insurance only covers 84 trillion.  So you still have two trillion left that are no good.  It's God's way, though, you know.  It is God's way.  It's very mysterious.  It's God's way to give people blood cancer, especially if it's a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  That's God's way.  It's always good.  So Andy Levy last night, I was checking out his Twitter.  TV's Andy Levy.  TV's Andy Levy.  On Twitter, Andy Levy.  Yeah.  And he tweeted this fucking video, and it's called, the name of it sucks a dick. 
[00:07:30]  It's Del Dot.  Del Dot removes Basketball Hoop Delaware Online News Video is the name of the fucking video.  I think it's doing well, so I guess, what do I know?  It's the Delaware Department of Transportation.  Del Dot.  Del Dot.  God, what assholes.  Wait till you see this, Jimmy.  So the setup is very easy.  This guy is doing an interview with the news.  I guess some asshole in the neighborhood has decided that basketball hoops need to be removed from the neighborhood. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And this guy's been fighting his basketball hoop being removed from the neighborhood for a little while, it seems like.  Yeah, he's sending appropriate letters you hear about in this story.  And now he's doing an interview about, you know, what's going on.  And it's key to the story.  I think he says it.  The hoop's been in place for 60 years in front of his house.  So obviously, probably before he was even fucking bored, because he doesn't look like a 60-year-old man.  It's been there forever.  And I think also pertinent to the story is the fact that the news was there interviewing him because the DOT had come there previously to remove the basketball hoop. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  But this guy's wife crawled up and sat on top of the hoop so they couldn't remove it.  Right.  So the news, I guess, thought that was kind of a newsworthy thing, sent a crew down there to interview this guy.  And in the middle of the interview, the DOT shows up again with police.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, we'll stop it so we can fill in the blank.  This is annoying me already.  The country's supposed to be broke, and this is what they're wasting their money on? 
[00:09:00]  That's what Ann said earlier.  Yeah, they're wasting their money on this.  And what really comes into play in this is the fact, and we've talked about this so many times,  the fact that you don't own fucking shit.  You think you own your house?  You think you can do whatever you want on your own fucking property?  No, you don't own shit.  You want to do anything, you need to fucking grease a representative so you get a permit  and fucking pay through the nose so they can get their cut on everything you do.  It's mobster tactics. 
[00:09:30]  And they're permit crazy.  We've been talking about this off and on for last year.  Permit everything you do in your house you need a fucking permit for?  How is this now my property, my house?  I pay a fuckload of taxes on it, yet I'm not allowed to fucking put a hoop on there  or build an addition or change a room or remove a tree or put in a pool  or put up a fence or a sidewalk or go through a million fucking things, change the roof color?  So you need a permit to put up a fence?  You need a permit to take a tree down? 
[00:10:00]  You need a permit to use the parks now on Long Island?  Yes.  Permit, permit, permit, permit, permit.  Nothing but permits everywhere.  When I went to put my...  What the fuck are they doing?  When I went to get my backyard done, my backyard was, when I moved in, it was flat grass.  It was just mud.  Mud.  Mud all around it.  I remember those days.  Just a muddy, grassy mud.  It was just flat.  It had grass on it.  That was it.  I'm like, you know what I want?  You had a vision.  Yeah.  You certainly had a vision.  Because I'm an American, I've achieved a certain place in my life that I'm very happy with, 
[00:10:30]  I want a pool, I want a fence around my yard to keep the riffraff out, I want a pool house,  and I want certain other things, maybe a built-in barbecue, I want everything.  So now some trees have to be removed, things have to be brought in, holes have to be dug,  pools, pool parts, all that shit.  The amount of permits that I had to get to do this was astounding. 
[00:11:00]  Probably no less, I'll say more, no less than a dozen permits.  Come on.  All of them money, time.  Just to redo your backyard?  Just to put in what I wanted to put in on my own fucking property that I'm paying for.  Name the permits.  I don't believe you.  Permits?  A dozen.  How about just a pool permit to have the pool, right?  That's one.  That's one.  Then every aspect of the pool needs to be inspected, and you've got to pay the inspector,  and he's got to sign off on it.  Plumbing, the wiring, the cement work, proper drainage. 
[00:11:30]  You need a sump-type thing just in case something happens.  Then there's the fence.  They only allow a three-foot fence in my neighborhood.  To get a six-foot fence or a four-foot fence, to get a six-foot fence, you need a variance.  Why the, why the, what, this shit drives me nuts.  Yes.  Yes.  What's the difference between a four-foot and a six-foot fence?  Oh.  Luke Costello and Abbott.  What is, Tommy Lee. 
[00:12:00]  What is the difference?  Uh, two feet.  No, the difference, the difference is.  You're being literal.  The difference is simple.  Yeah.  If you want the six-foot, which most people obviously would want.  Pay more.  Pay more.  You know you're going to have to pay more.  Tree removal.  Now, there were trees in the way of getting this pool and fence installed.  Yeah.  To remove every tree, you need a permit for the tree.  The pool house, an external structure on your property.  Now you need a guy to come out and assess the distance between. 
[00:12:30]  So now you need a survey done on your property line.  You have to pay for all this, by the way.  This isn't supplied by anyone.  You really got to stop.  You got to stop.  No, no, I'm continuing.  You asked.  I'm having a survey.  I'm out of my mind.  And survey your property and make sure the non-attached structure on your house, the pool house,  is within your property, the proper leg.  It can't be close enough to the fence.  The pool can't be close enough to the fence.  Why?  What's the problem there?  I should be able to tuck it right against the fence, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, why?  Nope, sorry.  Because the fence is supposed to protect from kids and stuff jumping in the pool.  Sorry.  All right, now the pool's going to take up more electricity and shit like that.  So I had to put new service in, 240 service, had to go in.  Now the electrical inspector has to come by and inspect the electricity and the wiring  and make sure everything's up to code.  And now, bam, more cash is coming out of my pocket for that motherfucker.  How about your barbecue?  You want to build a brick, a standing barbecue that isn't something you wheel out and stuff? 
[00:13:30]  That's a permanent structure.  You need an inspector to come up.  Why?  Because they need their money to claim that they're fucking broke.  Why?  If you're just wheeling a barbecue out in your backyard, that's way more dangerous than  if you actually build a nice structure.  There you go.  With cement and bricks all around.  And now the fence, by the way.  Oh, wait, I brought up the fence already, didn't I?  Oh, how about the guy that's got to come over and make sure your fence is safe?  And there are alarms on every entrance from outside to inside the area with the pool. 
[00:14:00]  So if some little toddler opens it up, it goes, meh, meh, meh, meh.  You have to pay a guy for that?  A guy has to inspect that to make sure it's there.  So why do you have to pay the inspector?  Because no one else is.  I pay him.  And he probably gets a paycheck.  Why?  He probably gets a paycheck from the state or the county that I'm paying my taxes for.  If we're paying our taxes, then that should just go with it.  And the inspector comes out and fucking makes sure it's all on the up and up.  Why are you paying extra?  This shit is driving me nuts in this country.  And this is just to have the all-American backyard that I wanted on my own property. 
[00:14:30]  You would think I went to a neighbor and just started doing work in his yard.  Sure.  And people are like, hey, hey, what are you doing?  Obviously, you've got a lot more going on in your backyard than the average person.  You know what?  Not really.  I like bringing it back to the average guy.  Not really.  Most of that stuff, the average guy has to deal with.  If a guy wants a pool, you don't have to be fucking a rich guy to get a pool.  I know a lot of people when I was working that also worked and had pools.  And they have to go through the same thing.  If you want to play down anything, a sidewalk, this, change something, these have to be inspected. 
[00:15:00]  Who started this?  Who fucking started it?  And again, we're a representative government.  Who was the representative that suggested this, that was voted into office, that everybody said,  now this is why I put him in here.  So we could be fucking extorted like the mob can extort us to do things around our own houses.  I'm doing my breathing exercises today.  Yeah, do it.  I'm doing my breathing exercises.  By the way, I apologize for taking off yesterday. 
[00:15:30]  I took a day off and I do have a twin cousin.  You're back.  That's very mellow.  Yeah, it looked like you.  I know, he did.  He came in.  We've been, like, our looks are impeccably identical.  Well, we were calling him Anthony.  What's his name?  Yeah, his name's Pete.  Pete, so we'll know for next time.  Pete Cumia.  He came in and I was listening to the show a little bit.  Don't you have an Uncle Pete?  Well, it's always Petey.  Oh, shit.  I'm in trouble with the mob. 
[00:16:00]  And he was embarrassing to listen to.  He was.  Because the things he was saying.  I was, like, listening to the Obama speech and he was like, oh, I don't care.  And I'm just like, ah, I'm ready to go crazy on the guy.  I kind of like the Pete guy.  I hate Petey Cumia.  Can Pete come back?  What an asshole.  He's a fag.  I like the Pete guy.  Slow down with the fag thing, but I like the Pete guy.  No, there was something else.  Oh, so what do you think?  Local government, they all get together.  At the, where?  At the, what do they call it? 
[00:16:30]  At their little town hall or whatever it is.  The town hall.  And what are they, just bored so they just make up shit to bother us?  Yeah.  Yes, they justify.  Is that what it's coming down to?  It's another version.  Look down the hallways here.  It's another version of justifying your job.  Like, hey, I'm an inspector.  I got to inspect.  Right.  What can I add to my schedule of inspecting?  And then if something isn't right, enough to code?  They don't want to work either, by the way.  No one wants to work.  Most people don't want to work.  No.  But there's an incentive because they're getting a little action. 
[00:17:00]  Because you have to pay the guy to come out.  You've got to pay the guy.  You've got to pay the guy.  And God forbid something isn't up to code because of some reason, and you have to change something.  Oh, then the fines have got to be ridiculous, right?  And then you have to change it, there's no fine yet, but he'll go, all right, you change that, I'll be back in a couple of days.  And then you pay him again.  You have to pay him for the second visit.  And the amount of, oh, here's another thing.  The amount of paperwork to get the permits in the first place costs you money.  And you've got to fill out things that are ridiculous.  Here's an example.  I have a tree.  It's your tree. 
[00:17:30]  It's dying.  It's a dying tree.  I want to have it.  I have to have it removed, or this thing's going to fall onto my house at some point.  So let me slow you down.  If it falls down on your house, then what happens?  I guess the insurance company's got to pay.  Town isn't fucking responsible.  You should fucking sue the town.  Yeah, you could, but you know what that's going to take.  You know why?  Because I know where you're going with this.  So you tell those fuckers, look, I couldn't afford to take the tree down, so I had to keep it up, and now it fell on my property, so now I'm suing you.  As they say, you're sitting with pina coladas in my jacuzzi.  I can't afford to have this tree removed. 
[00:18:00]  Bring it back to the average guy.  I know, yeah.  I'm sure the situation's where the average guy has a dead tree, and he can't afford to get it removed.  The average guy's situation got nothing to do with it.  So let the fucking tree fall on your house, and then sue the county.  Yeah.  And go, look, I couldn't afford to take this away, so I took my chances.  They would say, like, hey, it's your property.  That's when they'd go, hey, it's your property.  Oh, yeah, now it's your property.  But it's not your property, because now you're going to pay somebody, the county, all sorts of fees and shit to remove the fucking tree.  None at all. 
[00:18:30]  Sorry, go back to the story.  I was going through this form with Keith that you have to fill out in order to have a tree on your own fucking property removed, and not just any tree.  This tree's dying and shit.  But the questions, is the tree sick?  Is the tree posing a danger?  How big is the tree?  Please measure the tree around from the ground, four feet up.  Give us the diameter of the tree.  There's questions up the ass. 
[00:19:00]  And then you've got to go down to the town hall and file this form with money.  Of course, everything is money.  And then an inspector now comes out and inspects the tree to make sure it's ill-fated, doesn't interfere with your neighbors in any way.  Do you have to pay the inspector?  Oh, yeah.  I'm out of my mind.  Again.  I'm serious.  And now I've got to pay the people that cut the tree down, obviously.  That's got to be paid.  But I don't mind that, because that's what I'm having them do.  But it's the lead-up to that. 
[00:19:30]  And I'll have a lot of fucking firewood next year, because that's a big goddamn fucking tree.  How much money is it going to cost you before the company comes in and takes the tree?  It's at least a cup.  Because that's something you expect, obviously, like you said.  I'll tell you, before anything, before that tree gets touched, about two grand.  No.  Yes.  There's no fucking way.  Yes.  There's no fucking way.  Filing fees, inspection fees.  There's no tree.  Who can afford that besides you?  A fucking arborist.  I have to hire an arborist to come up and inspect the tree to make sure there isn't some kind of fucking... 
[00:20:00]  It's not an endangered tree.  It's not a home to a fucking spotted owl.  It's not...  No shit!  An arborist!  I'd rather hire an arsonist and burn the tree down!  Sounds like arborist.  It does.  It's not funny, but it sounds like arborist.  That was an excellent point.  Yes.  All good points aren't funny.  That was just very valid.  Well, not at all.  Yes.  That one just happened to lack humor in every way, shape, or form. 
[00:20:30]  Someone's saying I should just hire Jill.  Holy shit.  Or burn it.  It's very funny.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Or call an abortionist, they're saying.  There you go.  Or how about an abolitionist?  An abolitionist!  Oh, man.  Get rid of him, too.  This guy.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  I can't take it anymore.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You gotta be kidding me.  Dude, this tree is just retarded.  How is this happening? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And I gotta deal with a neighbor, but the neighbor's been pretty cool.  Like, Keith has been over there and talked to him, because there's no way a truck can  get in on my side of the property, because of the fence and everything like that.  And my backyard's all done.  It's got gates and everything.  And my neighbor's driveway is, like, right next to the fence and that tree.  Right, right, right.  So I think the tree-cutting company is gonna have to go into his driveway and stuff.  I'll grease him.  I don't care.  You know, you pay off a neighbor.  You gonna pay your neighbor?  Well, I won't.  I don't have to, but I'll throw him a few bucks for the convenience.  I wouldn't take it if I was a neighbor.  I would just be neighborly. 
[00:21:30]  Nah, it's cool.  I don't mind things like that.  That's kind of just like...  How much are you gonna give, like 500 bucks?  Nah, I was thinking a couple hundred.  All right, I thought...  Just for fucking...  I thought 200.  Just a couple hundred.  You know, there's gonna be a truck in his fucking driveway.  It could be inconvenient for a while, so here you...  And if he doesn't take it, that'll be cool.  He never...  You know, I never offered it or he never said he would take it.  For once, it's nice to be your neighbor.  Yeah, that's it.  Because most of the time, he's probably like, oh, this fucking asshole.  This guy does.  No, believe me, during the summer, he's probably peeking over the fence.  And enjoying the view, right?  Looking at what's going on.  Topless girls in the jacuzzi.  You keep the trees a little low for him so he can check shit out. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  Oh, that tree being removed, by the way?  Oh, you see.  I think it leads a complete opening from one of his upstairs windows into the jacuzzi.  Oh, shit.  So, he's...  He's in heaven.  He's gonna be like, yeah, cut it down.  I don't care.  Yeah.  He's gonna show up with a fucking hammer and a saw.  I'll be sure to help.  I'll do it.  He's trying to pay me.  Is the fence thing...  This is what...  Is the fence thing where you can't have something too close to...  We had a problem with the neighbor years ago.  Because they built something too close to our property. 
[00:22:30]  And the overhang was over our property.  And then the squirrels were jumping into our tree from his fucking roof.  I wonder if that's what it is.  All these neighbor disputes that have popped up over the years.  There is something like that.  Obviously, if you have a structure that's leaning over their property line, that's a problem.  And I can agree with that problem.  But the thing is, then keep it after it happens or something.  Have the neighbor complain.  Then have somebody come down.  Whatever.  Or have a talk and say, here's where it is.  Or you see it going up as a neighbor. 
[00:23:00]  Go like, hey, isn't that close?  And then settle it.  I had to move my pool drawings.  They drew out where my pool was gonna go.  We submitted it.  They said, okay.  It was 10 feet off the property line.  Then they said, no, it's gotta be 20 feet.  Why?  And then I was like, wait, you said 10 fucking feet.  And they're like, no, it's 20 feet.  And then they came back and said, 25.  And I'm like, motherfucker, I've gotta draw this pool where it's gonna go on my property.  Whether it's gonna be, you know, perpendicular to a fence or slightly askew or shit like that. 
[00:23:30]  I gotta fit it in here.  If you have a fence, why?  Exactly.  Just because they're...  They just wanna bust your balls and make a little extra money.  It's all about the money.  It's all about fucking them just shaking you down.  It's a shakedown.  It's like a fucking bad cop going to a drug dealer and just shaking him down because they can.  Because the homeowner has no recourse.  Where are you gonna go? 
[00:24:00]  They're all in it.  And there's a town hall somewhere today where they're making up more shit to just bother you.  More shit that's gonna cost you money.  They get money.  And then they cry poverty and raise your taxes on the property you can't do anything on.  Right.  How are they crying poverty on top of it?  So it leads to this video that Andy Levy really, really kicked into high gear last night on his Twitter.  Just in case you're tuning in, we go back to this video.  You wanna explain it again, Anne?  So you got the, what is it?  Yeah, the Department of Transportation for Delaware is going out and just plucking basketball hoops off of people's property. 
[00:24:30]  They're close to the street because you know how kids like, especially in cul-de-sacs, like to play basketball.  But the net is on the property, the people's property, but they're playing in the cul-de-sac.  It's been done for years, this shit.  Basically, the pole's on your property.  Yeah.  Or maybe not because I think they have some kind of fucking law where they technically own three or four feet into your property.  Yeah, whatever that is.  And now the actual hoop, when you make the basket, the ball goes down onto the street.  We all know this. 
[00:25:00]  We all grew up with these hoops.  We've seen it a million times.  They've been around forever when no one's done this.  Well, they've been plucking these things out, the Department of Transportation.  Why?  Because they had nothing better to do.  They were gonna pluck it out of the ground.  Seriously?  In front of this guy's house.  But the guy's wife decided to climb the pole and sit on it.  So she, obviously they couldn't remove it.  Would she call for advice, Fonzie?  Hey!  She's getting a little carried away, too.  It's not exactly a fucking redwood, the cutting down lady.  I hate them, too.  She chained herself to it. 
[00:25:30]  So, but she was doing that.  And then the news came down and thought it was an interesting story.  Was interviewing the husband right there in front of his property.  And then he went, oh, here they come again.  And the DOT came with police this time.  And it's the exchange between the guy, the police, and the DOT.  Yeah, the female voice you're gonna hear is, uh...  Is a police, uh, woman.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  And she's just a cunt on wheels.  Big fucking time.  And this guy is making valid points.  And, uh, she's blatantly lying to the guy.  Uh, really, I, it's, it's amazing to me that this happens. 
[00:26:00]  And the guy is relatively young and he's got a cane in his left hand.  So, you know, he's, he's a little...  Maybe he's just classy.  Did he have a monocle?  Yeah.  He had a top hat.  Maybe he was putting on a show in the driveway.  He's a bit disabled.  So, here's the video.  The audio, anyway.  It's on our Facebook if you want to check it out.  Yeah.  My wife, uh, was dropping off my daughter from school this morning and coming back through Ashburn Hill.  Don't say Stephen King.  She saw, uh, about five or six DELDOT trucks.  Big ones. 
[00:26:30]  DELDOT.  Um, monster dump truck with a couple basketball.  Already having two basketball hoops in the back of it.  Not just the hoops, by the way.  The entire pole and everything.  Two or three guys to every truck.  Fucking assholes.  Um, coming out, pulling basketball.  A picture with a truck filled with basketball hoops right now.  If you drive through the neighborhoods, it's not every basketball pole in the neighborhood  that would be quote-unquote in violation.  Look at all those basketball hoops in the back of the truck.  It's on one of our neighbors at the end of the street's route out of the neighborhood, and he's the one who made the anonymous complaint that started this all back in September. 
[00:27:00]  Some asshole.  One neighbor.  Burn him!  Burn him!  Sixty years.  Been there sixty years.  Why all of a sudden did it become a problem?  She saw the trucks coming, and they started pulling in down the street, and they started  down at the bottom.  So she said, I'm going up the pole.  Right on, man.  Get me a cup of coffee.  One jerk-off neighbor.  She should have used some conditioner up there.  I watched.  I got her a cup of coffee.  She climbed up the car.  Straw head.  Sat up on the pole.  Minute.  Oh, here they come.  Here he is.  See, now they're coming back in the middle of the interview. 
[00:27:30]  This is beautiful.  With the cops.  You never get to see.  They're back.  How they treat the average person.  I may have to end this interview.  Unfortunately, I can understand your.  It's the policewoman.  Unfortunately, Delta has the right of way.  They've sent out certified letters.  I don't want to.  But we have.  We have responded back to those letters myself and my state representative.  And we have not gotten responses to our responses to them.  So we felt this matter was still pending.  And for them to come out here and ambush us at 8.15 in the morning and start stealing 
[00:28:00]  basketball poles is not right.  Here's what I'm going to tell you right now, though, okay?  Can I have two hours to get my TRO filed?  No, you may not.  Why?  The car needs to be moved right now.  I'm in the car.  I do not want to arrest you or your wife.  Arrest you.  Could you pause that a minute?  Could you pause that?  Go back slightly.  There is a threat of arrest right now over a basketball hoop for this guy that is just  trying to give his side of the view. 
[00:28:30]  He's not in any way being violent.  He's not in any way being he's not trying to incite her into anything.  He's just discussing this.  And she immediately goes with the arrest threat over a fucking hoop that's on his goddamn  property.  I don't hate her.  I don't hate her, though.  Not yet.  Oh, you'll hate her.  Not yet.  Okay, at this moment, I don't.  Okay.  You'll hate her.  Yeah, not yet.  Okay.  I guess technically you could say she's doing her job.  Right, yeah, right now she's just going, don't go up in the thing.  But there's no fucking reason to even... 
[00:29:00]  That the police are involved is astounding.  And the fact that it's not, it hasn't been fully gone through whatever process is kind  of annoying.  Yeah.  Well, it shouldn't even be a process.  Just leave the fucking basketball hoops alone and go figure something else out.  But he's filed papers and everything.  And what, there can't be an injunction of a removal until this is done.  I mean, if you want to take the whole legal aspect that this hoop legally doesn't belong  here and we're ripping them out, well then, as an American, you should be able to refute  that with legal paperwork and using your representatives and hash this thing out and get some kind of 
[00:29:30]  injunction.  But they don't want to hear it.  It's not in there.  No, fuck you.  We're taking it.  You really are just yelling into a room by yourself with stuff like this.  No one is listening.  No one can listen because they're all in it.  The people that are supposed to be listening are in on it.  This is what we want our local governments doing, though?  Right.  We're going around neighborhoods and pulling out fucking basketball hoops?  Really?  How about...  Are you fucking kidding me?  I wonder how many people are playing basketball in these hoops because they don't have fucking 
[00:30:00]  jobs.  What scumbag...  What scumbag anonymous neighborhood anonymous complaint?  Can you just picture the person in your head?  We can all relate to that.  I can picture who that is in my head.  There's always one asshole.  Cowards.  The whole neighborhood is always torches and pitchforks and do them old school.  All right.  So back to this.  Oh, by the way, so you know, because it's a visual, obviously, like I said, the video  is on our Facebook page, but the van, the minivan is right under the hoop.  Yeah, he...  Trying to protect the hoop.  Right.  And that's what she said.  Move the fucking car. 
[00:30:30]  I want to arrest you or your wife, but that is where this is gone.  The car needs to be moved.  She'll be up that pole again in two seconds.  She will not be up that pole again.  Okay?  Why?  Because we're not going to allow her.  It's disorderly conduct if anybody goes up the pole.  I think the car moves right now.  Disorderly.  Am I still going to be allowed to keep my pole?  They're not taking the pole.  They're putting them...  They've asked people if they want to keep the lady in the garage.  Well, I would like my pole, yes, because...  They let everybody keep it.  That's not what I saw.  My neighbors didn't tell me that. 
[00:31:00]  The law is supposed to take it, but they offer you the courtesy of letting you keep it.  You may stand here.  You may not talk to them.  You may not talk to them.  She said taunt them.  Oh, did she?  Can you pause that because it's worth...  And you've got to go back.  He starts screaming in the background, March Sadness.  March Sadness.  That's pretty good.  You can barely hear it.  March Sadness.  I take off, obviously, on March Madness. 
[00:31:30]  He's calling it March Sadness.  And what you see is a fucking...  What is that?  A front loader?  Yeah, a big front loader.  A big front loader is about to just rip the hoop out of the ground that's been there 60 years.  Who is the fucking asshole in this?  It's like these guys, these DOT guys are hateable, but they're just doing it.  Someone told them to go do it.  They don't give a fuck.  Someone told these cops, look, there's a fucking problem now.  You've got to go protect the DOT workers.  You can't have this.  So they're doing what they're told.  But there's somebody, if you go up the chain... 
[00:32:00]  Up the chain is the cunt.  Is the prick.  Somebody is the motherfucker who's saying, not too bad, and that's who you want to hate.  But it's like, who is it?  I hate them all.  The DOT...  And you're going to hate this blonde in a moment.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially after what was said.  And I think from your own property, you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want  to these DOT people.  And you can't.  Don't taunt them.  Don't...  Whatever.  I'll say whatever the fuck I want.  Yeah.  From my property?  I'm not making threats.  Right.  I'm fucking commenting.  You're allowed to taunt.  I'm giving running commentary on them fucking, you know, abusing my right as a homeowner. 
[00:32:30]  I would not survive this situation.  You'd have three in the chest.  No, I know my limit.  You'd be like a chimp in Connecticut if he's running at the cops.  Biting off noses and testicles.  Not even being cocky.  I would not be able to survive this situation.  I would have a major fucking problem on my hands.  That's crazy.  Did you back it up so we hear March sadness?  I didn't hear that.  March sadness is fun.  March sadness is pretty good.  I'm sure you will. 
[00:33:00]  March sadness.  You take kids.  That's a good one.  There goes 60 years of history, guys.  Look at it.  And the thing just falls down.  That pole's staying, please.  What?  You just told me I can keep it.  You lied.  You said we had the option to keep in the pole.  You can come and pick it up.  No, you didn't say that.  You said I can keep my pole. 
[00:33:30]  Your kids right now.  Go in the house.  All right, pause it.  Pause it.  There's a lying fuck right there.  Yeah, she did lie.  Right to his face.  It's on camera.  We'll put it in the driveway.  We'll lay it in your driveway.  Yep.  You could keep it.  Yeah.  And then they're loading it on the front loader where they're then going to put it in  a dump truck.  And he goes, wait, I want that in my driveway.  Yeah.  And they're like, no, you could come pick it up or something.  And then she says, go in the house.  And go in the house.  Fuck you, go in the house.  Yeah, fuck you is right.  There ain't no reason for that guy to go in his house.  He's standing on his property, voicing a complaint against a civil fucking servant. 
[00:34:00]  And it's well within his fucking right.  No one likes you to object anymore.  People now think that objection, or even being loud when you object, is fucking cause for  arrest.  Right.  On an airline, you can't object.  Nope.  They don't know the difference between justifiably being pissed off and objecting.  And voicing your opinion.  And somebody running, yelling, Allah Akbar, with a fucking bomb to the chest.  Really?  You don't know the difference?  Right.  I hope she's catching some shit for this.  I, I, I, in her life, I just hope that people are recognizing her and going, wow, man. 
[00:34:30]  I wonder if she's a sub sexually, she's a female cop.  A lot of them are fucking dirty.  I wonder if she just said that.  Do you think she just said that to, to get the situation?  Of course.  Just like that.  She didn't want to deal with the guy and, and said, uh, yeah, well, we're giving everybody  the option to keep the pole.  We'll lay it in your driveway.  She didn't even say giving everybody the option to keep the pole and then end it right  there where it's like, well, we give you the option, but you got to come pick it up.  So she said, we'll lay it in your driveway.  She didn't say that.  She fucking lied right there.  And why can't they just lay it in the driveway? 
[00:35:00]  That's fair enough.  Of, of the guy's property.  Yeah, exactly.  She doesn't want the headache of it going back up, but that's not her fucking place.  Yep.  Yep.  If he, if it puts it back up, then so be it.  Then deal with it, but leave the fucking pole in his driveway.  It's his property, but they had to drag it away.  Why?  And they're all just taking it away.  And they leave it to fall and bend.  And then they dump it in a dump truck where God knows that, you know, they're not going  to individually take it out.  That fucking dump truck's going to go and just dump them all out at a junk pile.  What do you think?  They're saving it in the, just in case you want to come pick up your basketball hoop section 
[00:35:30]  of town hall.  That's going to the dump motherfucker.  Pile them all up in the corner of the evidence locker back at the station.  Yeah, and label each one with names on it and go, yeah, this is the Smith's pole.  Yes, and here, Mr. Smith, take your pole away.  She did fucking, she lied.  She said he could keep it.  Lied right to him.  And she said, we'll put it in your driveway.  And thank God it's on camera, because you would go to the town officials and go, look,  they'd lie to me, and they'd be like, yeah, okay.  And she'd go, no, I didn't say that.  There's an edited part that they edited out. 
[00:36:00]  You're a fucking liar.  I hit it.  Let's go.  Let's get to the end of this.  We had the option of keeping the pole.  You can come and pick it up.  No, you didn't say that.  You said I can keep my pole.  You're a chance right now.  Go in the house.  Go in the house.  Real brave.  Go in the house.  We can stand out here.  We cannot talk these people.  The wife.  You just lied to me, officer.  You can talk to me.  Roll the tape back.  You know what?  You just told me we can keep that thing. 
[00:36:30]  And now you lied.  That's a great use of force and money power today.  And I have the freedom to speak.  It's the United States' First Amendment rights.  Speak my will.  They fill in the hole.  Well, they're filling in the hole so a kid doesn't trip in it and break his ankle and sue them.  And they're, watch this.  And look at this.  Here's his hoop.  Here's 60 years.  They just, front loader, bam, right into the dump truck.  It's infuriating.  I'm so out of my mind.  That bitch did say he could keep it. 
[00:37:00]  Yep.  And then the truck goes away with the basketball over the back.  And there it is.  I think that's it.  There it is.  I love how the wife said, you make me sick.  Yeah.  And then the guy's like, yeah, I'm fucking, I'm on my own property.  I'll say what I want.  Go in the house?  What are you, my mommy?  Go in the house.  What are you, my mommy, you bitch?  Shitty Delaware accent.  Fuck you.  All over a dumb basketball hoop that's been there forever, not bothering anyone.  And she said, you lay it in your driveway if you want.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And he said, yeah, I want to keep that. 
[00:37:30]  Now you could come pick it up.  Pick it up.  She just wanted to, she was just saying whatever she had to say.  It's James and Lars.  To get out of there.  What?  It looks like James and Lars.  It's not Lars.  It looks like, that's James.  It is Hetfield.  Yeah.  They're probably on a location somewhere, though.  It's not Lars.  I don't know who that is.  No, the story could possibly be on Fox News.  That's not Lars.  No.  No, that's not Lars.  Anyway.  It looked like him for a second when I saw James.  A big thank you to Andy Levy bringing that to you. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  Infuriating, though.  A lot of people's attention.  God damn.  Isn't that just driving you fucking nuts?  It's a great example of what's going on in this fucking country with the local governments  and...  Local government, state, federal.  I mean, this is all it.  It's just getting in your business for no fucking reason.  We're in a fucking mommy state.  This is a mommy state that we're living in these days.  You're not allowed to do anything.  Like Jimmy said, you can't dissent anymore without being labeled something. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You used to be able to just talk and speak your mind, and that was that.  Whether you got results from it or not, at least it was open for debate and stuff.  Now, you're instantly slapped with one of these labels.  You're difficult.  It goes from being difficult to being a fucking terrorist, and everything in between.  And nobody ever can make a snap decision and go, oh, you know what?  That's a good point.  Right.  It's like, on the airline, when they charge me for that food, the fucking shit flight attendant  couldn't just go, ah, you know what?  That is kind of shit. 
[00:39:00]  They didn't have the meal they're supposed to have for you.  Let's just do it the right thing.  Those fucking people couldn't go, you know what?  The guy makes a good point.  The cop couldn't go, you know what?  All right, he has this thing in motion.  None of these fucking dumb robots can just improv on the spot and go, you know what?  That's a great point.  Let's not do this.  Or let's put this on hold.  And honestly, did that, and the guy said he had paperwork in, he's working with a representative.  Did it really have to be ripped out at that minute?  No, it didn't.  Right then?  He asked for a little time to get something filed, I guess. 
[00:39:30]  Like, he was going through a legal procedure since he was notified that this was going to happen.  I would be even pissed off if he wasn't going through the legal, proper legal channels.  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, because it's crazy.  But granted, he was.  It's even worse that he was going through all of the legal procedures, and they probably put him off, put him off, and did it really have to be ripped out at that minute?  Was it such a hazard, or whatever the fuck they're calling it, that it had to be taken out like that? 
[00:40:00]  It wasn't ticking.  This thing wasn't ticking and full of C4.  Did we point out it was at the end of a cul-de-sac?  Yes, it's in a cul-de-sac.  A dead-end basis.  It's the same hoop you've seen growing up forever.  A million fucking times.  Some cocksucker neighbor.  Why don't you hate your neighbors?  Oh, fucking with those goddamn...  Who's complaining about the hoop?  Who cares?  Somebody that probably didn't like the noise.  Yeah.  Tick-oom, tick-oom, tick-oom.  I got a hoop.  Actually, the neighbor that I got to ask if I could use his driveway to get my tree out, he's got a hoop. 
[00:40:30]  And it's actually facing the fence and my yard.  And every so often, during the summer, we're in the pool, the basketball just comes flying over the fence and land in the pool.  And it's just the kids, and they're like, hey, mister, can I have my ball?  Don't you love when that happens?  Oh, I love it.  And then I get to play a game because I have to now shoot the basketball over the back of the hoop and try to get it into the fucking...  I got to shoot it over the rear of the backstop and get it in the hoop.  And I've done it a few times. 
[00:41:00]  It's a lot of fun.  That is fucking...  I'm annoyed now at that video.  I'm so annoyed.  Someone just sent me another video.  I'm trying to see if there's more to it.  She did.  Are you curious about why the state police would act this way?  The internet has a theory.  A theory?  Uh-oh.  Let me tell you my theory.  On Google Street View, go to Hillsdale, then just follow down the street until you reach the dead end.  So you can Google Earth and get to the dead end.  While we walk, did you ever wonder how a neighbor got so many state troopers just to deal with the basketball hoop? 
[00:41:30]  Hmm?  Who could possibly get such excellent service from the Delaware state troopers?  Ah, okay.  Who was the complainer?  I'm waiting for the next one.  Going down...  Judge smells.  Okay.  I want these basketball hoops taken down.  I want them slapped with an injunction.  Make their heads spin.  Yeah, they're suspicious that it took all those troopers showed up for that.  So maybe this person that complained is pretty powerful.  A little powerful.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Sounds like a conspiracy. 
[00:42:00]  This fucking video's got legs, man.  Oh, yeah.  This one's going to be on the news.  It's got legs.  And again, it just shows you something also.  The fact that the news isn't playing this right now.  This will be like, eh, Friday.  Probably.  They'll hit it.  And it'll be like a news story.  Probably.  Meanwhile, everybody that is into any kind of...  Social networking.  Social networking.  Social networking is all over it already.  The internet.  You've seen it already.  Andy has an update.  Andy has an update.  State police investigating a hoop incident.  Legislator works to get basketball pulled back. 
[00:42:30]  No, Andy Levy had an update.  Oh.  They're conducting an internal investigation into last week's confrontation between that  family and the trooper, which I guess is the woman.  Well, they have to because it's on video.  Now it's on the news.  That's one good thing.  Once it hits the news, then they have to do something just to shut everybody up.  Whatever fucking asshole probably made the decision is now worried that they're going  to look bad, so then they'll just do something to clean it up.  Yeah.  And then the news people go, oh, we're very happy we got the thing back. 
[00:43:00]  And our neighbor was executed.  We asked for our neighbor to be burned alive with a stick in his ass that he was.  Yeah, it was good.  Actually, ironically, we tied him to a basketball pole and burned him.  The officer's flating us.  Does anyone know why it's a problem to begin with?  Something about a code.  Something we all grew up with and was never really a problem.  It's some code.  It's called a free zone that they have in Delaware, where I guess it's a public property  or city property, town property.  And if it overhangs that property, that it has to be removed. 
[00:43:30]  So if the hoop is overhanging a curb, as it would be because you're playing on the cul-de-sac,  that is some type of problem.  Now, why it's a problem?  I don't know.  Because they were bored at the town hall and said, look, we got to make up more shit.  And that's a made-up reason because some guy down the street didn't like the ka-chunk,  ka-chunk, ka-chunk of the basketball hitting the street, kids playing, laughing, having fun, perhaps. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, probably this guy hates the kids in the cul-de-sac and said, well, if this is a law,  if I can get rid of that fucking hoop, I'll have a more peaceful existence.  They knew who it was.  That guy seemed to know who it was.  Just fucking move, then.  Asshole.  It's astounding, though.  The whole lack of freedoms that we have on our own property, what is supposed to be our own houses.  Because the ability for government to come in and use police and troopers at the same time 
[00:44:30]  to come in and completely just not acknowledge your freedoms under some guise of some weird law  or statute or fucking just some ordinance, whatever the fuck it is.  They have the power to do anything, to transcend your constitutional rights and do anything to you.  But the other side will say, well, they were breaking the law.  Exactly.  And my point is really simple.  There shouldn't be a law like that. 
[00:45:00]  There's other things to worry about before you start making laws about basketball hoops at the end of a cul-de-sac.  A law or a city or town ordinance can be whipped up and you could be held responsible or arrested  or fined for things that should just be you enjoying your life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness  in your own fucking home.  But those days are gone.  Gone.  Someone noticed, I didn't notice that, there are portable basketball hoops in the truck. 
[00:45:30]  So those could have very easily been just moved into a driveway.  Right, right, right.  The wheels, the wheels, they fold up actually a little bit.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that.  Amazing.  Because that's an easy one and just knock on the door and go, look, it's sort of breaking a law  because you move your fucking hoop into the driveway.  Yeah.  But no, why would you do that?  Unbelievable.  The person who made the complaint was an 86-year-old man who doesn't like the kids playing in the street.  That makes sense, you life hog, die.  For 86 years old, why don't you just fucking, why don't you get the DOT to fucking dig a nice hole? 
[00:46:00]  And you crawl into it face first.  Just die.  I think I hate the kids too.  So I would hate them too, running around, punks.  Probably would be, but what are you going to do?  You can't do anything.  Requiring the area immediately next to the pavement and subdivisions to be free of obstructions.  Now that makes sense if you're talking about a, you know, if you want to build a shed in front of your house in the cul-de-sac, 
[00:46:30]  that would fall under that free zone requiring the area immediately next to the pavement in the subdivision to be free of obstructions.  But why do they have to make that?  There's not an obstruction.  They just, you could use any law.  It's worded in a way that they could use that for anything from even a car parked on your street.  But what else was that meant for besides basketball?  Probably the fact that they don't want any kind of permanent or temporary structure being built in front of your house that might go into the roadway. 
[00:47:00]  But a basketball hoop technically might fall into that.  But again, like Jimmy says, you should be able to talk reasonably with somebody,  not make it such a black, white, yes, no issue, and say, oh, it's a basketball hoop?  Yeah, you know what? Those are fine.  And then in the end, if you're going to take the fucking thing, you'll put it in the driveway like you told them you would.  Yeah, because it is there.  Yeah, there's two problems here.  Why do you feel like you have to now take it away?  Yeah, hauled it away like the rest of them.  So fucking inferior. 
[00:47:30]  It really is irritating.  Then they took them all and loaded them into, I heard they loaded them into boxcars and drove them to a basketball pole camp where they're under horrid conditions.  You think they're removing basketball hoops in Harlem?  I don't know.  You think they go to the black neighborhoods?  Hey, first they come for your basketball hoops and no one helped.  That's right.  And then in the end, when they came for my basketball hoop, there was no one left to help.  Where's that from?  Holocaust. 
[00:48:00]  All right, we're going to take a break.  Enough of that.  The video's everywhere.  It's on our Facebook page.  It's on my Twitter.  It's on Andy Levy's Twitter.  You'll see it.  You'll see it.  If you're a social network guy, you're going to see that video today.  Oh, by the way, I agree with the guy because it's a white neighborhood.  Of course, if this was black people having their hoops removed, I'd go, look at him again being nasty to the police.  And can I, you know what?  And can we point out that if they showed playing basketball, if the news had showed like the white family and eight black kids playing, 
[00:48:30]  and the daughter was dating a black guy and him and his friends would all play.  And the neighbors complained about the noise.  I wonder if they were a different tune out of him.  What?  They're fucking running around making noise.  You pay for your house.  And there they are yelling and whooping with rap music.  I'd be there myself pulling those hoops down and having chats with those girls.  Well, would that be a tune changer?  Of course it would.  Good.  Troublemaker.  Troublemaker.  Exactly. 
[00:49:00]  Behave.  Just behave.  Why don't they behave?  Let him take the hoops.  It's against the law.  You're breaking the law.  Why doesn't he behave?  Leave your cane in the house.  Again, a problem with the cops.  Although he wouldn't have been able to go back into his house after being tased and shaking on the street.  They probably would have tased the guy.  They probably would have.  Listen, E-Rock, I actually want the lady that was in the tree crying.  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember that? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Because this started with Anthony's tree that he has to remove.  I forgot what it's called.  Remember the...  Yeah, the woman should climb one of these fucking redwoods, I think.  Or the...  Or wasn't it a circle of people crying over the trees?  Yeah, because they didn't want the tree cut down.  And, you know, those people...  And they were holding their ground and...  They get pretty fucked up.  Crying over the trees.  They did do good stuff, the redwood savers, though.  I actually am agreeing with the redwood savers.  I love a good...  I like the tree huggers.  I like that.  My whole bar top is made of old redwood. 
[00:50:00]  It's 6,000 years old, the tree that it was taken from.  They hacked it down slowly.  Making every ring feel it.  Yes.  Every ring felt yes.  The saw blade.  I actually have a mark on a ring on my bar top where...  The time where Christ was born.  And do you like your bar top?  Oh, I love it.  It went from being a lovely, giant, living thing for thousands of years  to having beer rings on it. 
[00:50:30]  To your fucking...  You're and Danny's four elbows on it.  Four elbows on some vomit.  You fucking...  You're giving awful...  You fucking...  Space is endless.  Your dumb drunk talks at four in the morning on a Tuesday.  Fucking infinity.  I can't comprehend it.  Ah, fuck them.  Dumb tree.  When they can run away from the axe, then I'll be like, okay, we should save them.  And you know that little ring is the tree's ear and it has to just hear all this shit? 
[00:51:00]  It's like a writer and I heard this.  Fucking babble.  We know, we know, we heard.  It's endless space.  We don't get it.  I was 400, you cunt.  You cut me down.  Ah, fuck.  Oh, people.  What do we got?  We got it, Iraq?  You don't have the people crying over the trees.  Can you find it?  Not the news thing.  I found a little worse of peace.  It's three minutes.  It's the crab apple tree lady?  No, that was the two old ladies.  Oh, okay.  Then that's not it.  Oh, no.  Remember the two old ladies that sat down in their little lounge chairs? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, that's kind of fun.  In front of their apartment and didn't want that.  That was a Massachusetts story.  Yeah.  What happened with that one?  I don't want a tree.  Good day.  You can play that.  It sort of goes with the first hour.  What the hell?  If you can't find the other thing, play that.  When we get back, Iraq pulled some audio.  Oh, cool.  Remember yesterday Danny McBride was in?  Pulled some pork.  And remember, I love pulled pork.  It's delicious.  Right, Iraq?  Pork shoulder is delicious.  Ah, it is.  Pork shoulder?  Pulled pork shoulder, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  I need to eat the shoulder.  Because it's delicious.  Poor pig is just walking around looking like Joe DeRosa.  It's impossible for it now to be middle of the road.  He can't just go, meh.  He can't shrug at all.  He looks silly.  Yeah, no shrugging pig, motherfucker.  That's what his friends call him, you no shrugging pig, motherfucker.  Shoulderless pig.  He always has to be decisive when they ask him, where do you want to go to eat?  How do you feel?  He has to just do his eyebrows. 
[00:52:30]  Dumb pig.  Poor guy just wants to shrug and dummy's chewing on his shoulder.  Ah, fuck.  Someone's mentioning mailboxes.  What?  They could have started yanking up mailboxes then, right?  Ah, you know what?  That probably falls into the same fucking thing.  It would be the same fucking thing.  Because they make the mailboxes over the road a little bit.  They're over the road so the driver can go in and shove it right in there.  You think they'll start fucking pulling up mailboxes next?  Ah, no.  Fucking assholes.  Hey, uh, E-Rock did pull audio for right after the break.  Danny McBride was in yesterday and we were praising him in Up in the Air and saying how 
[00:53:00]  great Up in the Air was.  Uh-oh.  Or I said, I love that movie.  Yeah.  Well, uh, E-Rock pulled some, uh, audio from December 8th, 2009.  Oh, great.  And from, uh, Jimmy, January 25th, 2010.  Oh, boy.  It was a two-day thing, huh?  Oh, yeah, it was.  So, we'll play that right after the break.  It was a little different back in 2009, 2010 when we were talking about the air.  You say we changed our tunes?  Oh, boy, did we.  All of a sudden, Opie, uh, quote, loved it. 
[00:53:30]  And I really don't remember not liking the movie until the stupid fucking listeners pointed  it out.  So, now E-Rock had to get the audio to prove that I was just a big fucking douchebag.  I remember hating it, but I didn't remember that Danny was in it until he mentioned it.  And I'm sure that came up yesterday.  Yeah, okay.  Actually, we're going to play Jim Norton Hates Trees.  We found another bit.  Oh, good, yeah.  That kind of ties in nicely.  I love when Jimmy hates things.  Check this out.  Trees are shit-thicks.  Petrified forest.  Bunch of fucking scared trees. 
[00:54:00]  Fucking knock it over already.  What the fuck do we need trees for?  Just make air.  Remember I said this.  Trees are for queers.  I don't value fucking plant life at all.  It's shit.  No one thinks about plant life as life.  You fucking step on it all the time.  If there were little fucking baby puppies on your front property instead of grass, would  you walk all over it?  And cut it, yes.  And cut it?  Got to mow the fucking grass just as it's starting to grow up and come of age. 
[00:54:30]  It's starting to see the world finally.  We have to mow it with our mowers.  I want to see a baby sapling and fucking just karate kick it.  I've always wanted to be big just so I could fucking bend trees with my foot.  Baby sapling.  Like a little one.  Just like a little sap comes out.  The first apple is hanging off it and I just come over and break it.  You should see the look on a tree's face when I fucking hook a handcuff up to my fucking  trailer hitch and I drive away with it. 
[00:55:00]  Just rip it out by the roots and giggle.  Birds hang out and shit all over your car.  It's not helpful.  I hate blades of grass too.  A blade of grass.  Yeah.  Just cut it all.  Make cement.  Fuck the difference.  Parking lots.  All front yards should be parking lots.  Not handier.  Exactly.  All your friends should come over.  Park anywhere.  What happened to those trees?  They were annoying me.  They were blocking my view. 
[00:55:30]  Fucking cut them all down.  Pave the whole joint over.  Fucking bowl in the front yard if you want to know.  So I guess you're enjoying these wildfires, Jimmy, if you don't like trees.  I love them.  There's nothing that makes me happier than seeing a bunch of black just smoke where trees used  to be.  I fucking love it.  Like when you see a landscape and they're all even, all even Steven.  Even Steven.  But look, it looks sad.  That's where trees and bushes and plant life goes, Jimmy. 
[00:56:00]  Exactly.  What do they do to stop the fire?  Trees beg for fire.  They really are.  I'd rather have gas cans in front of my house.  They're fucking totally worthless.  How do they beg for fire?  They do nothing.  Every year there's fire.  And every year they just stand there like dummies and take it.  How about you fucking, you drip a little, you save some rainwater or something, you fucking  asshole.  They just drink it up like dopes.  Spit some rainwater back at it. 
[00:56:30]  They just, they just, they're built to be walked on.  Fucking birds live in them.  Fucking like bees hang out on them.  We make paper out of them.  They do nothing.  We wipe our assholes with trees.  Is that great?  Big, big, mighty creature.  That's what you get.  Anything that wants to fuck with a tree can.  They have no defense.  Fucking bark.  So they should save some of the water and keep themselves nice and moist.  Of course they shouldn't.  Next time a fire comes, they fucking contribute a little.  They're just waiting for us to do all the legwork. 
[00:57:00]  They just sit there waiting for the fire.  Well, they do.  They're probably just shaking, like looking at each other like, is someone going to help?  I cannot wait to see that animation.  Sirius 197 XM 202, The Virus.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's got to be Clapton's birthday, huh?  Two brilliant songs in a row right there.  All right, slow down a little bit. 
[00:57:30]  It's a bit of a...  I was going to say a drop-off.  I don't know.  Drew Boogie and Clapton.  I say Boogie is God.  Boogie is God.  Boogie is God.  Clapton is 66 years old today.  66.  Wow, I hit the post.  Wow.  I still got it.  That was good.  I think it was TMZ.  They're showing Clapton doing his own laundry.  Does anyone know why Clapton is doing his own laundry?  I had a laundromat, too.  No way.  No, you don't.  I don't like the laundromat idea because there's something that embarrasses him. 
[00:58:00]  He either sharts a lot or he has cum in the back of his underpants.  I just want to explain that to an Asian woman.  Or he just likes to wear panties or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Washing his unmentionables.  You know what?  You're probably not to something.  I think it was TMZ.  He was there once and then they caught him again.  Clapton at a laundromat.  We're saying it for the record.  Eric Clapton is gay.  Wow.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Why is he in the laundromat?  I don't know.  He's Eric Clapton.  When you find that story, it's a week or two of them. 
[00:58:30]  Maybe he's one of those guys.  Old already.  Maybe he's a cheapskate or maybe he's one of those guys that he's been so famous for so  long.  There's little weird things.  Doing laundry is kind of comforting.  I like doing laundry.  You like doing laundry?  Yeah, but it's just my stuff.  I fucking hate it.  I don't, though, dude.  I do it right in my apartment.  I like to fold a little bit.  I like folding.  Shirt sleeve, shirt sleeve, shirt half over, shirt half over, shirt doubled, shirt doubled.  Wow.  You can fold a shirt properly?  Why would my nickname be what it is if I couldn't do that?  What's your nickname?  The shirt folding key. 
[00:59:00]  My shirts, when I fold them, it's really wide up top.  It's like the backs of the girls that blow me.  It turns out into a, it's like a triangle, kind of.  I can't fucking fold shirts properly.  I'm amazed by people in stores who can do it in midair.  I have to be on the bed when I do it.  I lay it flat, face down.  Talking about a girl?  Yes, I lay it flat.  I cut diamonds in her back.  Face down.  Relax, Frederica.  And I lay it face down on the shirt, and I take the little sleeve, short sleeve shirt, 
[00:59:30]  and I fold the sleeve in.  I take the other sleeve and I fold it in.  So now my shirt is almost a rectangle.  Right.  And then I take the shirt, and I fold it in half one way, into a third, and then a third.  So now it's a much thinner rectangle.  Oh my God.  You fold crazy.  And then I fold it into thirds again, starting with the bottom.  Fold up a third, fold up a third, and I turn upside down.  Is it the size of a stamp when you're done?  Yes, it is!  Jesus!  Is it perfect?  It's not perfect.  Is it like Gap?  No.  I mean, look, it's funny you say stamp, too, because I was going to get a tattoo that said 
[01:00:00]  stamp shirt's been gillicuddy.  Get me a t-shirt.  Bring me a t-shirt.  I want to see what Jimmy's fucking talking about.  Bring me one of yours, and I'll see if I can strain a muscle lifting it up.  Yes, we're doing laundry folding tips here on the Opie and Anthony show.  And there's Clapton in the laundry bag.  Wow.  I would've got a picture with him.  That's fucking Clapton.  What are you doing?  Oh my God.  What is he doing?  I would've got a picture with him.  Maybe he's trying to pick up chicks.  Ah, you know.  Maybe he's hoping that someone goes, hey, you're Clapton. 
[01:00:30]  He doesn't need to do that.  A laundry bag.  You never know, man.  Plus, the women in the laundry bag are probably not Clapton fans.  My clothes are in there first, motherfucker.  You don't know why he does his laundry, and no one knows?  The English laundromat he's in, it does look very clean and nice, though.  Was it in England?  Right?  I don't know.  I don't know where it was.  I don't know.  Well, anyway, whatever laundromat he's in, look at those shiny machines.  It's probably his basement.  Is he that rich?  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Now that would make sense.  All right.  Well, we'll figure out why Clapton does his laundry, hopefully, in a minute or two.  Don't forget, we've got Colin Quinn, Norm MacDonald, and Brock Lesnar on the show today.  Yes.  So we've got to move through a couple more things before it gets busy.  So yesterday, we had Danny McBride, and his new movie looks like it's going to be great.  Looks funny.  I think I'm seeing it tonight.  Oh, you are?  I think I found a screening.  What is it called again?  Your Highness?  Your Highness.  No, not Your Highness.  Isn't it Your Highness?  Something Highness.  It is. 
[01:01:30]  Your Highness.  Your Highness.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's like a hard R.  Yeah.  And looks great.  He was fun yesterday, man.  I like Danny.  Danny's cool.  He's a great guest.  He's a good hangout guy.  He hasn't forgotten about us, which is nice.  He will.  He shouldn't.  None of them should.  No, he should have forgotten about us by now, Ant.  Yeah, he's that big.  I think we got past the hump with him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  T-shirts have arrived.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, look at these.  Now, there's one way to do it, is when you're holding it.  Now, I'm holding it?  Can I show you my? 
[01:02:00]  Sure.  Because you're going to be the king of this.  You can do like this.  Let's see how Obie does this.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's going to fuck your arms up.  That's actually not that bad, dude.  Seriously?  It's a little sloppy on the bottom.  A little.  Ant's doing it.  You can just do it that way.  Ant's holding it.  That's too wide.  Yeah, it is too wide.  Oh, no.  And then you go like that.  No.  Here's what you do.  Here's what you do.  Mine's really thin.  Yours is too wide.  Here's what you do.  Here's what you do.  Fold this, bitch.  And you throw it to your girlfriend. 
[01:02:30]  That is the easiest way to do it.  Can we end the bit there?  Because no one cares.  No.  Dude, I want this.  Dude, how are you not filming this?  This is a good...  I filmed the yogurt toss yesterday.  Holy shit.  This actually turned out all right.  Hey, well, you folded.  I folded it.  And look, the whole logo's on the back.  It's not going to look right.  See, my technique...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but yours is...  Look at this.  No.  That's too much.  Holy shit.  He actually knows what he's doing.  Wow. 
[01:03:00]  That is a tiny little shirt when you're done.  Of course it is.  You know why?  Because I carry these motherfuckers in my pocket.  I like to fold shirts and put two or three in my pocket.  Jimmy's a folded motherfucker.  Jimmy, do it.  No joking.  Do that again.  Because I can't fold t-shirts.  You might have sit...  So you do what?  Sleeves in.  Now you have a rectangle.  Okay.  A third.  A bing.  A bing.  And then you go like this.  And then you go like that.  And you have a nice little thing.  Holy shit.  And then you go like this.  Hey, shit. 
[01:03:30]  Kick that motherfucker.  Because you feel gay from folding, so you've got to be tough.  So the key is to fold the sleeves in first.  Yes.  Sleeves in first.  Well, the long sleeves are even different.  Long sleeves are different.  I need the flip fold.  Give me a flip fold.  Wow, look at that thing.  Folds in five seconds.  The flip fold.  Yeah.  Who fucking thought of this?  I like the flip fold.  Yeah, what a fuck.  It's a giant mechanism.  It's plastic, and it's got hinges on it.  Do you know how sloppy that looks?  Dude, I would get the flip fold in a second. 
[01:04:00]  The flip fold fucking blows.  Look how perfect everything is.  Neat and wrinkle three.  That wouldn't hurt your OCD at all.  Flip folding.  You'd just be flip folding.  No, no, no.  My OCD has nothing about being neat.  God, that looks good, Anthony.  I know, marble cake.  I mean, your cock bulge.  Oh, right.  That's a good one, Joe.  Couldn't resist.  42, and that's where I went with that joke.  I did jokes.  Check out how to fold a t-shirt in Japan on YouTube.  Why?  Are they shitting on someone's face while she cries?  I've seen people do this at the laundromat.  Like, I've seen Asian people do this, and it's crazy. 
[01:04:30]  What?  Why?  It's just the way they do it.  Insert their small penises into the change machine.  No, no, no.  They do a very specific thing.  How many ways there are?  And we got the answer to Clapton.  Which one do you want to do first?  Clapton first.  Let's do Clapton.  We're actually talking about folding t-shirts.  Why not?  That's the kind of show we do.  It's called Lousy.  Larry in Mississippi.  Hold on.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey.  You're going to find your shirts folded in the hallway, Larry.  I'm an old gray-haired fart, but I like my stuff done a certain way. 
[01:05:00]  I don't even want my wife washing my clothes.  I know how I want my clothes.  Wait.  Excuse me, Larry.  Do you have something on Eric Clapton?  Well, that's probably...  Well, no, no.  Well, I'm saying he's in the laundromat because he probably likes to wear...  That's right.  I thought he had an answer to the Larry...  No.  ...the Eric Clapton.  I almost called him Larry.  I think he was saying that Eric Clapton probably feels like this guy does.  Right.  But why wouldn't you do it at home with a washing machine and dryer and not in the laundromat?  Maybe there's a problem.  Maybe they're being fixed or replaced.  Oh.  Now, look, Larry was an abysmal disappointment, but he raises a point. 
[01:05:30]  There's probably something Larry doesn't want his wife to see.  Like the fact that, again, like there's cum and blood and jimmies from ice cream in his fucking underpants.  In the front and back.  Yeah.  He doesn't want anybody in the rally.  Surprise again, Jim, with the humor.  What's this video?  Well, it's just, I guess, I mean, I don't know what exactly the video is.  I just know how Japanese people fold shirts, and I'm assuming that this is it.  All right.  Well, how can it be different than what we do, or Jimmy does?  Great.  Abby and I are here to demonstrate to you the art of Japanese T-shirt folding. 
[01:06:00]  Aye.  What you have to do is imagine your T-shirt exactly in half.  Then imagine point A, point B, and point C.  The first thing you want to do is grab the fabric of the T-shirt at point A.  They grab from the middle?  This is crazy.  And do the same at point B.  Ah.  Ah.  Now, take point B, and gently fold it up and over your hand to point C.  Wow, no way!  Now pull point A through point B and C. 
[01:06:30]  Turn the shirt over and lay it flat.  Then flip it over on top of the sleeve.  There's stuff hanging out over there.  And there you have it.  Voila!  A perfectly folded bag.  Wow!  Thank you, Eddie.  I hate this woman.  I'd take a dump on the shirt.  Jimmy, try to do what they just did.  Mine would be all wrinkled.  How the fuck?  You saw how slow that she did it, you know, for instructional purposes?  I've seen people do that at the laundromat where they're just flying through T-shirts. 
[01:07:00]  Jesus Christ.  They just do everything.  It looks like it would be all fucked up.  It looks...  What?  I don't need that.  Point A, point B.  Try the point A, point B, Ant.  It's going to be very difficult.  Try the point A, point B.  Okay, here we go.  I'm grabbing from here.  Yeah.  And I'm grabbing from...  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, do the point A, point B.  Do I have the front and the back, or just the...  Yeah, right there.  You got the point A, point B.  All right, you got the points properly.  I got it.  All right, go.  Now what?  Now I go like this.  That's great.  Sorry.  You just choked yourself. 
[01:07:30]  I apologize, everyone.  You are a bag of shit, private files.  That's a great visual.  What a fucking T-shirt.  I saw it.  You didn't watch?  I didn't learn.  I watched with zero comprehension.  I didn't get that.  Is she going to do the same thing?  I think so.  Be flat and a side on to you.  Uh-huh.  Step two.  Pinch.  Pinch one.  Draw an imaginary line with your finger across the middle of the T-shirt.  Oh, middle.  Stopping short at the edge.  I do this, Dan, while they're doing it.  Pinch the T-shirt between your thumb and...  Hold on, hold on.  Who wants to pinch this T-shirt? 
[01:08:00]  I don't want to pinch it.  Why are you yelling?  Pinch the T-shirt.  Pinch the T-shirt.  All right, we're, uh...  Okay, okay.  I'm imagining a line.  You'll be able to do it.  You'll be able to do it.  Surve a T-shirt.  Yeah, that's all right.  All right.  Step one.  Lay it flat.  Lay it flat.  Lay the T-shirt so that it's completely flat on the side on to you.  Flat.  Flat.  Flat enough.  Step two.  Pinch.  Pinch one.  Pinch one.  Draw an imaginary line with your finger across the middle of the T-shirt, stopping short at  the edge.  Yeah.  Pinch the T-shirt between your thumb and forefinger on your left hand at this point. 
[01:08:30]  You've got the first pinch.  Making sure that you've gripped the front and the back of the T-shirt fabric.  Step three.  Where's pinch two?  Pinch two.  Oh, up by the shoulder.  Pinch two.  All right, you got the pinch two.  With your other, draw a line directly up the T-shirt.  I'm there.  And pinch on the shoulder seam of the T-shirt directly above this point again.  Okay, I got it.  Always top.  I got it, I got it.  Making sure that you've gripped the front and back of the T-shirt fabric.  I'm there.  Coming back.  Step four.  Pinch three.  Pinch three.  Bring pinch two down behind your hand.  Okay.  And pinch the T-shirt at the bottom, directly beneath the two pinches.  And pinch the bottom along with your original pinch, again making sure that you've gripped 
[01:09:00]  the front and back of the T-shirt fabric.  Okay.  You should now have the top and bottom of the shirt pinched between the thumb and forefinger  of your right hand.  Now what?  Your hands should be crossed.  They are.  Step five.  The flick.  Keeping a firm pinch with both hands.  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Bring pinch one in your left hand up and away.  Now what?  Now the sleeves just hang in there.  That's okay.  The flop and fold.  Did you do the flop and fold?  You should now have the T-shirt hanging down from your two hands. 
[01:09:30]  Lower the T-shirt, sleeve first, back onto your flat surface, creating a fold on the  T-shirt that is symmetrical with the line between your original two pinches.  Bring the T-shirt down flat.  The T-shirt had a stroke.  I almost had it.  You almost had it.  That sucks.  Ah, fuck this.  Language.  I didn't even know you could fold a shirt like that.  Oh, and.  Owns a flip and fold.  Greatest thing ever.  Yeah, I think we all should get those for-  Fuck the flip and fold. 
[01:10:00]  For bonuses from SiriusXS.  Flip and folds for everyone.  I'm going to figure that out.  Okay.  So, Danny McBride.  That's what we were talking about.  Yes.  His new movie looks like it's going to be terrific.  And he was great yesterday.  He was.  And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Up in the Air came up because he was in that movie  and we forgot.  And I went, oh!  I loved it.  Actually, we got the clip.  Oh, okay.  We make it very easy for everyone.  So, this is what happened yesterday with Danny McBride.  Just wondering if working with George Cooney is as good as everybody says it is, or if  he's kind of a douchebag. 
[01:10:30]  No, he was totally cool.  You know, that movie, Up in the Air, that I did with him, I never had met him before.  I literally walked onto the set.  I forgot you were in that.  I love that fucking movie.  Fucking Oscar nominated movie.  Fucking liar.  I forgot all about that.  We haven't talked to you.  Fucking liar.  I forgot about Up in the Air.  Jeez.  It's a great movie.  You're a fucking liar.  I didn't even believe what I was saying.  I said it four times.  Yeah, it was really the worst sell ever.  I said it three, four times.  Three or four times.  I love that movie.  So, that's what I said yesterday. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  You go back to December 8th, 2009.  This is never good.  Doesn't it suck?  Everything is recorded?  A year and what?  Three, four months ago, I said this.  What do we got, Ant?  So, we got...  No one gives a shit about Up in the Air, so we can move on from that.  Right away, you just fucking trashed it.  Right away, you trashed it.  Nobody gives a shit.  Nobody gives a shit.  Sounds like your favorite flick. 
[01:11:30]  Phony.  You loved it.  Nobody gives a shit.  It's just a very blah movie.  I don't know why the reviewers loved it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, you loved it, too, didn't you?  Yeah, you don't know why the reviewers loved it.  You loved it.  The only thing I can say, and I've said it three or four times now, I don't remember not  liking the movie when I said that yesterday.  I just have no recollection I didn't enjoy this movie.  I want to start over.  Yeah, please.  What do we got, Ant?  So, we got...  No one gives a shit about Up in the Air, so we can move on from that.  It's a very... 
[01:12:00]  It's just a very blah movie.  I don't know why...  I don't know why the reviewers love this movie so much.  Because you just said it.  It's a blah movie, and they're blah people.  From what I saw, it looked like him hooking up with some chick.  You're not going to see this movie.  Jimmy won't see this movie.  You'd be surprised what I'll see.  Jimmy might see this movie on a flight or something.  Wow.  It's just a very blah movie.  So, Jimmy didn't see the movie at that point, and then a month later...  I guess a month later, he saw it, right?  Jimmy saw the movie and had this to say.  And you were all in yesterday with the Up in the Air. 
[01:12:30]  No, I didn't say I liked it.  I knew I hated the movie, and I wouldn't have said I liked it, but I wouldn't have said  I hated it either.  I was phony, too, by not saying I didn't like it.  You just...  But I just wasn't as despicably phony as you, by apparently praising it like it was Citizen Kane.  That's why critics love this hunk of shit.  Oh, you went right to it, didn't you?  So this is, yeah, Jimmy, a month later, back in 2010.  That's why critics love this hunk of shit.  Terrible movie. 
[01:13:00]  Up in the Air.  Yeah, it wasn't good.  Danny McBride was fun.  I will not stop.  Even Danny McBride couldn't do it.  There was no reason for him to be in that movie.  Thank God I saved myself a little bit, because I said that yesterday, too.  He saved himself a little bit.  Jimmy, not so much.  But it wasn't attacking Danny.  I was just saying that there was nothing he could do in this movie.  Yeah.  I hated it that much.  I want to play the clip from yesterday again, and I want to listen for Jimmy.  Oh, right.  That's true.  I want to hear what Jimmy said.  I did say...  All right, here's where I was slightly phony. 
[01:13:30]  Perhaps I was a little closer to your complete phoniness than I'd like to acknowledge.  I did say, with enthusiasm...  Oh, I forgot you were in that movie.  Which implies, through my faggoty lilt, that I enjoyed the movie.  Yeah.  You know what?  So I was a little phony, but I was just...  We...  I couldn't...  I didn't say it.  We'll go back to yesterday again.  So you heard the two clubs, me and Jimmy, hating the fucking movie.  Yes.  And now back to yesterday again, with Danny McBride in studio.  Just wondered if working with George Clooney is as good as everybody says it is, or if  he's kind of a douchebag. 
[01:14:00]  No, he was totally cool.  You know, that movie up in the air that I did with him, I never had met him before.  I didn't, you know, and I literally walked onto the set.  I forgot you were in that.  I love that fucking movie.  Fucking Oscar-nominated movie.  I forgot all about that.  We haven't talked to you since then.  I forgot about Up in the Air.  Jeez.  It's a great movie.  Fucking Oscar-winning movie.  Oscar-nominated.  Three, four times.  Nominated, yeah.  Nominated, yeah.  What the fuck?  You were really just like, wow, is this the best movie ever? 
[01:14:30]  I must have had an aneurysm or something.  I don't know what happened.  Jesus.  Holy crap.  What a fuck.  And then it's just like, there's a piece of shit.  Fucking phony.  I love it.  I'm embarrassed.  Come on, that's funny.  Oh my God.  It wasn't even close.  Shit like that happens.  There's the complete opposite.  Complete opposite.  So do I like it?  No.  I don't even know.  You hate it.  It sucked a pile of dicks.  I'm going to watch it again now, because now I've got to figure out if I liked it or 
[01:15:00]  hate it.  You hated it.  I hated it.  Of course you did.  It stunk.  Can we go back to Anthony folding t-shirts?  Ah, that was good.  You almost had that.  Damn it.  You almost had it.  I almost had it.  I was stunned when I twisted it and the sleeve fell out.  You should have him try again from memory.  No, I can't do that.  See how far you can get.  Memory.  What the hell's that?  I wouldn't.  I absolutely wouldn't know.  That's short-term memory.  That shit is shot.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, God.  I wanted to, I guess the only way, well, if anybody wants to come over in a locked, soundproof 
[01:15:30]  room, I would do my break on Obama visiting the Museum of Natural History.  I'm not doing that here.  He went to Harlem yesterday.  Yes, he did.  For a Democratic fundraiser.  $30,000 a seat.  $1.5 million he raised.  Some chicken place, was it?  Of course.  I think it was.  See, I'll do that for you today.  Up there?  Of course.  I was just saying.  It's like a famous place up there.  What is wrong with liking chicken so much?  I eat.  Chicken is fucking delicious.  99% of what I eat is chicken.  What's wrong with it?  Chappelle had a very funny bit years ago about how he hates eating white chicken when white 
[01:16:00]  people are around.  Because if they look at it, they're like, there it is.  Just like it says in the encyclopedia.  They love it.  You're not Chappelle delivering.  It was really funny.  That is great.  That motherfucker.  That's great.  What's wrong with liking it?  Who cares?  I know.  It's just a, I don't know.  He went to the museum, huh?  Yes.  And then he went to the Museum of Natural History and took a look around.  So they had to close the whole museum for the day? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I don't think you could just walk around while he's there.  No, I don't think they were allowed there.  I saw quite a few motorcades yesterday on my way home.  You did?  On the parkway and shit.  Because I guess they, you know, have to bring them up from Kennedy Airport.  So they kind of, motorcades come up and block off certain roads and shit.  But, and they were doing massive construction on the westbound lanes and it was completely  tied up.  And one of these motorcade things was just stuck in traffic. 
[01:17:00]  No, really?  You would think, you would think they could coordinate maybe not to do construction that  day.  So the motorcade isn't stuck in traffic.  Wow, that's scary for those guys.  It was like so stupid.  I'm like, well, I was, I was in the other, you know, direction.  And I'm looking, just going, what the fuck is this?  You saw his motorcade stuck in traffic?  You think it was his?  A motorcade.  It could have been other dignitaries that are coming in with him and shit like that.  But it's like, you would, you know that, that people are coming in.  No, you would have, you would, you would have known if it was his motorcade.  It wasn't Obama's.  It wasn't Obama's, but let me tell you. 
[01:17:30]  I've seen Bush's motorcade close up in Obama the last time he was in.  Me and Jimmy hung out on the corner.  It is a spectacle to see.  It is unbelievable.  You know when the president's coming down your street.  It is unlike, and there was, there's no doubt in your mind.  I saw another motorcade last night.  It was a dignitary by NYU.  I was walking in the cellar and on McDougal Street, a block from, two blocks from the cellar  is NYU.  And it was blocked off.  Like there was one cop blocking it.  And I thought there was an ambulance.  I walked down the street and there's a limo parked on this side of the street and a limo 
[01:18:00]  parked and a few cars were cops in them, black limo, like a town car.  I'm like, it must be a dignitary is in town.  Yeah.  So coming back from the cellar, me and Colin are walking and then the guy was leaving and  there was like two or three limos in it and a few cops.  We're like, well, who was that?  And as they drove away, the guy's like, I was the president of Italy.  So he had a little bit of a motorcade and the street was blocked.  But I knew it wasn't even Biden.  I'm like, there's no way it's Obama.  I'm like, I know it's not even Biden because you wouldn't be able to walk here.  Yep.  We actually just stood there and watched the guy walk out. 
[01:18:30]  Like, yeah, you don't get near him yesterday.  Driving home, though, in the opposite lane, I saw it was had to be in the lead.  A dozen motorcycle cops and all all lights.  That might have been Obama or Biden.  And then behind that shitload of NYPD cars and SUVs.  And then behind that, black SUVs and every one of them had lights on, lights on, lights  on, the vans.  And then, yeah, well, SUVs.  I didn't see any vans. 
[01:19:00]  I saw, like, a lot of SUVs.  And then a couple, a few limos.  And then behind that were more NYPD.  Were there presidential limos with the flags on them?  No, no, no flags.  You know what?  It could have been fucking Ahmadinejad or it could have been the Syrian president.  A lot of times those fucking, those guys have big entourages, too, because they can't  have them getting killed here.  It was some important shit.  But you would think, like I said, that they wouldn't fucking lead them into giant traffic  jams that were not moving because they're doing fucking pothole repairs because the day was 
[01:19:30]  sunny.  That means it definitely wasn't Obama.  Yeah.  They would have done a workaround or something.  They're not going to have them stuck in construction.  Never.  I'd love to watch, uh, I would love to watch Air Force One come in one day, like a Kennedy.  Yeah.  Let's do that.  That would kind of be fucking cool.  We know people.  You know?  Let's get that done.  Yeah, yeah.  I would like to see that because that's supposed to just look insane.  Why?  It just looks great.  It's just a plane coming in.  Yeah, but it's the paint job and the fucking, it just looks really cool.  Very majestic.  There's fighters around it, too, aren't there? 
[01:20:00]  There's fighters that come in before.  They come in, yeah, with it and helicopters.  Do they have two?  Is there like a dummy one?  Not a dummy Air Force One.  Well, you could call it that now with the president.  I want Pete.  Hey, dummy Air Force One.  I want Pete back.  You want Pete, my cousin Petey back in here?  Who was in yesterday.  Petey Kumia, my twin cousin.  I didn't explain that earlier.  Oh, he was terrible.  He has no passion for politics or anything else.  I like that motherfucker.  Or freedoms in this country. 
[01:20:30]  Jesus.  We had a fatso, I think it was in Massachusetts, found a fusion.  I thought you meant to be, I'm not going to say it.  No, I'm going to leave him alone.  He would never sit in a chair for two straight years like this guy did.  This guy was in a chair for two straight years.  Two years?  And the news story just sucked.  Someone tweeted.  I was hoping they had video of them getting the guy actually out of the house.  What did you do in the chair for two straight years?  He was stuck to the chair.  One of those things.  They had to cut him out of his own chair. 
[01:21:00]  How did he shit?  And then cut him out of his own house.  And then the people, the officers, I guess, that were involved with this.  Let me see.  They had to change their uniforms.  They had to throw their uniforms away.  Because of the stench?  Yeah, it was so bad.  What was worse?  His stench or Danny's farts from yesterday?  Danny, close second.  That stunk the whole studio up for the entire day.  It was great.  I had to make.  You had to make.  I don't have the story in front of me, I guess.  He was fused to the chair. 
[01:21:30]  Now, we heard a story about a woman that was fused to her couch a few years back,  which Jimmy wound up turning into a hysterical fucking bit.  Thank you.  It was very funny.  It's on my new CD, actually.  I never put that on my CD.  I never put that bit on my CD.  Oh, very funny then.  Despicable.  It's on Despicable?  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah, and this is a man that was found fused to his chair.  Now, how did he shit?  Wait, was this guy dead?  Did they cut out or alive?  No, he was alive, I believe.  I don't have the story in front of me.  He's got to give it a shit.  Yeah, he was shitting right where he was. 
[01:22:00]  A morbidly obese Ohio man was in the hospital Tuesday after police found him fused to a chair  he had not moved from for two years and was forced to cut a hole in the wall of his house  just to get him out.  The unnamed man lived with two able-bodied roommates, including his girlfriend.  How?  Who officials said fed him since he never got up.  Fucking codependent slobs.  The roommate called police upon finding the man unresponsive on Sunday. 
[01:22:30]  Officers who responded to the scene said that the man's skin had fused to the fabric of the chair  and that he was sitting in his own feces and urine with maggots visible.  So he was just shitting there, literally.  Now I'm not talking like Voss.  He was shitting in his chair.  One of the officers said the worst thing he had ever responded to.  Another told a local TV station they had to throw away the uniform after helping remove the man from the chair.  The living room where the man had the chair was very filthy, very deplorable. 
[01:23:00]  It's unbelievable that someone could live in conditions like that.  A local city code enforcer.  I'm sure they fined him something.  I instructed the landlord this morning and the people that the tenant at the house,  they had to get it cleaned.  There was no way they could live in something like that.  So they're working on it, he added.  The landlord told the news that the man used to be an active person. 
[01:23:30]  Said he had no idea how bad his condition was since he had covered himself with a blanket every time she came to visit.  You couldn't tell from the stench?  Of course you could tell.  That's fucked up.  Why are you feeding him?  The people around him.  So now I guess he was naked in his chair because it fused.  Maybe his clothes rotted away.  His clothes rotted off and he was just pissing and shitting sitting in the chair.  What the fuck?  And maggots. 
[01:24:00]  There were maggots crawling around.  Isn't that fucked up how your skin can grow right into fabric if it's there long enough?  Like one of those trees that grow into the signs.  You ever see a tree eat like a sign that's been there for a long time?  Yeah.  You see that?  It just fucking...  It grows right around the sign.  It's exactly what skin can do to fucking fabric and shit.  And then they had to cut a hole in his own house, one of those guys, to get him out.  Yep.  But Jimmy's right.  It's the people around him that are more despicable.  Enablers.  Why are you feeding into that shit? 
[01:24:30]  Go get your own chocolate cake.  How did he have a girlfriend?  She must have been a kook.  Yeah, yeah.  She must have been quite a kook.  I think you're right.  Well, that's fucked up.  That bicycle looks like someone put an old bicycle in the crotch of a tree many years ago.  And the tree just completely grew around the bicycle.  Oh, that's cool as shit, man.  Unless it's a gag.  It's a fake.  Although shit's not cool.  Unless somebody cut a bike in half and shoved the first part in.  And made an art project and took the next part out.  It's art.  But trees will do that. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I'm sure.  I hate trees.  I know.  We just heard.  Oh, a tree eating a park bench.  Hey, before people forget, Travis just ran in the Dave Chappelle chicken bit.  Oh, shit.  And he gave it a big thumbs up.  So, we were talking about chicken and then Jimmy, yeah.  She both referenced this.  You know, like a lot of people would be telling me, Dave, you know, you just got to relax.  The racism thing would be bugging you too much.  I'd be thinking about it.  Sometimes shit will happen.  You know, a lot of black people can relate to this.  Have you ever had something happen that was so racist that you didn't even get mad? 
[01:25:30]  You were just like, God damn, that was racist.  That was racist.  I mean, it was so blatant.  You were just like, wow.  Like, it almost like it didn't even happen that it was like a fucking movie.  That was like he was watching Mississippi Burning.  Wow.  That happened to me.  I was in Mississippi.  I was in Mississippi doing a show.  And I go to the restaurant to order some food.  And I say to the guy, I say, I would like to have, and before I even finish my sentence, 
[01:26:00]  he says, the chicken.  What the fuck?  I could not believe it.  Could not believe that shit.  This man was absolutely right.  I said, how did he know that I was going to get some chicken?  I asked him, I said, how did you know that?  How did you know I was going to get some chicken?  He looked at me like I was crazy.  Come on, buddy.  Come on, buddy. 
[01:26:30]  May everybody know, as soon as you walk through the goddamn door, you're going to get some chicken.  It is no secret down here that blacks and chickens are quite fond of one another.  Then I finally understood what he was saying, and I got upset.  I wasn't even mad.  I was just upset.  I wasn't ready to hear that shit.  All these years, I thought I liked chicken because it was delicious. 
[01:27:00]  Turns out I'm genetically predisposed to liking chicken.  I said, why?  I got no say in the man.  I got ruined chicken for me.  I'm scared to eat it in public.  I don't want somebody to see me and say something.  You know what I mean?  Like you be eating some chicken.  Look at him. 
[01:27:30]  He loves it.  Just like it's said in the encyclopedia.  Look how happy he looks.  I didn't realize I was blowing the punchline at the end.  But you didn't know we were going to play it.  That's true.  The journey was nice, though, Jimmy.  It really was.  I kind of liked the journey on that one.  One more story before break,  and then we're going to get Colin Quinn in here,  and then we got Norm MacDonald,  and then we got Brock Lesnar.  I want Colin canceled. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  I want that bum canceled.  He's a big star.  Is he done with that?  Yeah, but I think they're doing it in East Hampton.  HBO shot it.  He's doing it for 3H in East Hampton.  East Hampton?  Oh, the HBO thing is done already.  He shot that already.  That was great.  All right.  We'll catch up with Colin in a little bit here.  Yes, I love the Colin Quinn.  One more story.  You hear about the Staten Island man angry at his pregnant ex-girlfriend.  He sure pulled some shenanigans.  Arrested for flaming excrement attack. 
[01:28:30]  Yes.  The Staten Island man angry at his pregnant ex-girlfriend smeared excrement on her apartment door and set it on fire.  That's great.  He loves playing with his own shit.  Neither the six-month pregnant girlfriend or two small children with another man or a fourth person inside the apartment were injured.  The suspect, Rasheem Harrison, 24, was arrested Sunday morning at the seam.  But he wasn't done yet, Anthony.  Harrison relieved himself inside a cell at the 120th Precinct Station House and decorated the walls there with his excrement. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Forcing police to finally take him to Bellevue for observations.  Yeah, you don't do that if you're normal.  He was later charged with arson, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, menacing, and endangering the welfare of a child.  Is that a picture?  Yeah.  There's burnt shit and a little bit of flames, like residue up the door.  Yeah.  Residu-doo.  Oh, look at that.  You can see the burnt shit. 
[01:29:30]  Would you ever play with your own doo-doo?  Never.  Have you ever?  No, I've always been disgusted by shit.  I have no memory that I ever did that.  Sometimes I get done and I get off the bowl and I just look in before I flush and I go,  Ugh, shit.  We've all had the finger break through the toilet paper.  That's tragic.  It happens.  You only hope to God you'd clipped your nails right beforehand.  Oh, fuck, you're so right.  Because, you know, to clean under there.  You're so right.  Oh, boy.  Harrison, whose nickname is Illuminati, told police he was angry at his ex-girlfriend because 
[01:30:00]  she stole his cell phone.  Well, all right.  He had a reason.  All that because of a stolen cell phone.  He did have a reason.  He also used...  I don't know why this last line is not highlighted in the story.  It's so worth saying.  He called using the N-word on her, even though he's also black.  Oh, well, that's okay.  Now, that's a part of the story, too.  They're saying when black guys say nigger, they're actually reporting that as news?  Yes.  Holy shit.  Because they like, you know, implication there. 
[01:30:30]  I hate the press.  They're like, at least they mentioned race in the story.  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's all because a black guy said it to a black woman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why would a black guy say it to a white woman?  That would be so stupid.  I bet they do, though.  You know?  It's just kind of a thing you say.  I have no point.  It doesn't mean literally.  You know, like when I'm driving home, I don't literally mean it.  I mean, you're in my way and can't drive.  And you're of a certain ethnic background.  I wouldn't say it to an Asian person.  I use something completely different for that.  Which one do you use?  I got to go on.  I just use the CH one. 
[01:31:00]  I use the CH word.  You can say it.  No, I'm not going to say it.  You should say it.  Because I only use it in anger.  You should say it.  I'm making it sound like, see, this is the logical way that everybody should think.  But it is the way everybody thinks.  You should say it.  No.  Yeah.  I say it every day driving home.  As I'm passing someone on the left lane, on the right, doing fucking 50 miles an hour,  I look and go, up!  Uh!  And then racial epithet.  And then I go, that figures all the time. 
[01:31:30]  A Chinaman?  Well.  Okay.  Just any kind.  That's a CH.  An Asian person who stereotypically, as we know, has that stereotype that they are not  the best of drivers.  And a lot of times on my way home, it has been proven to be true.  They're not.  Look.  Even Asians know you're good at a lot of things.  Right.  Driving is 483rd on the list.  Yeah.  You can't be good at everything.  You always know.  What are they good at?  Map.  You see a very, they're very. 
[01:32:00]  Folding shirts.  Folding shirts.  Folding shirts, apparently.  I would say, honestly, let's make a list.  What's some of the other things Asians is good at?  They're good at folding shirts.  I think Asians are good.  Making Moogoo Gopin.  I think Asians are good citizens.  Asians have a great work ethic.  Great work ethic.  General soul chicken.  Family.  Great food.  You know, they're great at filmmaking, martial arts.  I love Chow Yun fat.  Throwing hand grenades in helicopters on pointer hats.  Massaging.  Packing themselves into the train. 
[01:32:30]  I will say this, though.  Driving.  You always know, because you see, like, the slow driver and the jet black hair, and you're  like, I just know.  You just know.  And when I pass, I see, and they don't, they're not looking in the mirrors.  You don't see their heads.  Yeah, I know.  They're not looking in the mirrors.  They're not doing anything.  Their hands are, I tend to, they're scrunched up at the steering wheel, and they're just  looking straight ahead, oblivious that there is a parade behind them. 
[01:33:00]  And when I pass them by, I get real close, and I turn my head and look, like, make eye  contact, motherfucker.  I want you to know you're fucking up.  Don't you know why cars are flying past you?  What's your favorite thing to see on the highway?  Favorite thing to see on the highway that makes me mad?  Or makes you chuckle?  Makes me chuckle?  Anything.  I'll start, because I brought it up.  All right.  When you see the work van that is graffiti, graffiti, graffiti riddled, where you know 
[01:33:30]  he just parked his van in just a bad neighborhood, and now he has to just drive around with  this horrific graffiti.  Not a little bit.  I'm talking like they got you.  Usually an Asian guy driving those.  I think that's why I bring it up, because I think it is usually the Asian work trucks.  Graffiti riddled vans.  It's usually some triad fucking graffiti.  It makes me laugh every time.  I'm like, that poor guy.  That, um...  You got one?  I don't know if it's something, because I take the tunnel, and what gets me... 
[01:34:00]  Oh, hold on.  ...and makes me laugh is seeing people that cannot drive through the tunnel.  They freak the fuck out.  I gotta stop this break, because Colin Quinn's calling from down the hall.  Oh, okay.  Yes, Colin.  Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt, but I've been down the hall for like 20 minutes.  They told me don't come in and wait until after the break.  What?  Which I...  I mean, I'm down the hall, but they don't want me to just run in and wait until after  the break, and I don't want to interrupt this fascinating conversation about folding  shirts, fucking driving Asian drivers, what was that, a 70s stand-up bed from the fucking 
[01:34:30]  comedy store, and the world's fattest man stuck in his chair.  Colin's been here that long?  You guys are fucking tedious.  Let me on the show you.  Just walk in, Colin.  Yeah, yeah, Colin.  20 minutes?  Colin, please, come up.  What?  I had no idea Colin was here.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll have Colin Quinn on next.  We're going to take a quick break.  You guys are tedious.  Fucking asshole he is.  Colin Quinn next.  Stay there.  Hey-oh!  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now. 
[01:35:00]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just got to acknowledge that's Coke Logic.  We didn't need the sweeper after that.  We could have came right back, but whatever.  But Coke Logic did a great job with that.  A viral video and then throwing Roland in there as well.  Yeah, Roland's in there.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Yes.  Hi, guys.  How are you, Colin?  Good, guys. 
[01:35:30]  We got to make believe we are seeing you for the first time.  We just talked to you for about 20 minutes.  Yeah, why not?  We had a lovely chat.  We just did all our best material before you came in here.  Isn't that what always happens?  Everything starts off with like, oh, let me tell you about this.  And then we were all just like, stop.  Don't say it.  Save that gold for the air.  There were a lot of laughs in there, Colin.  There were.  For four people instead of a, who knows how many people.  For us.  Broadway's own Colin Quinn.  Not anymore.  Well, on the heels of his Broadway show, he is rejoining us again. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Colin Quinn.  And we were talking before, while Jim was in the powder room.  Yes.  We were talking about how during the HBO taping, you know, I'm here for the old HBO.  It's on next week, April 9th.  April 9th.  Long story short, premieres on HBO.  And we talked about how it kind of aggravates me when Norton shows up as Mr. First Nighter  for anything because he's got that thing like of trying to be like a gentleman.  Like, yeah, I go for the, you know, like he's just got like, it reminds me of like those 
[01:36:30]  mob guys that used to always be like, yes, I have the envelope and I set it up like a  gentleman.  Is Jimmy trying to be the gentleman when he comes in?  Yeah, like Mr. First Nighter.  And he probably thinks to himself, like I take Jen out.  We go to the first night.  Meanwhile, you know, it's not really a date.  It's just on the arm kind of stuff.  But he probably thinks, yeah, I'm in the business and this is how I behave.  No.  Is that it, Jimmy?  Is this accurate?  No, I went because how many empty seats can you look at during an HBO taping?  And I had to go.  I wanted to go to the Thursday because I heard that one was good. 
[01:37:00]  No, I went on Thursdays, but I think I was on the road doing a gig.  It's all true what he's saying.  It was very good.  But that doesn't deny what I'm saying, which isn't there a little part of you that goes  out at night like, ah, you know, I really have things down.  I got my shit together.  I'm like a real guy.  I feel like I'm living because my sex addiction is so bad that I spend so much time literally  alone just torturing my cock.  I'm like, this is what a person does.  I'm alive.  Oh, this is when?  Yeah, my friend's taping an HBO special. 
[01:37:30]  I'm going to see.  I'm living.  I didn't want to go.  I wanted to just hear, hey, how was it, Carl?  Good.  Glad you had fun.  But you're actually doing something other than just biding time playing with yourself.  Yeah, just squeezing pre-cum all over my fucking dick.  I went and saw my friend.  And now I feel like I can reward myself with a fucking eight-hour tranny movie marathon.  That's great, though.  April 9th, Saturday, April 9th at 10 p.m. on HBO.  Next Saturday.  Should be a real home run.  That's very cool. 
[01:38:00]  How did this happen, man?  It started out as a tiny little show way downtown, and then they moved into Broadway.  Way downtown.  It started in Levittown before?  Yeah, that's what governors, that's why I started working it out.  Really?  Like all the great avant-garde theater guys.  Yes, yes.  Governors in Levittown is a mecca for avant-garde art.  It's the last place they had an OTB.  They still have that OTB.  Yeah, I see.  Is it still functioning? 
[01:38:30]  I don't think so, but I think the sign is still up.  They were saying, actually, speaking of fun articles, just yesterday in the paper they  were talking about how all the bookies are doing well now because OTB closed.  Because OTB closed?  They're making a comeback.  Well, how come OTB couldn't make it work?  I don't know.  It's a bookie agency.  How do you not make that work?  You fuck that up.  If that doesn't say a lot for what's going on out there.  I want to say something, too, because you mentioned governors.  Go ahead.  Colin mentioned governors.  I heard from Colin now.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo gave me explicit instructions last night. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  When I spoke to him, and he goes, yeah, tell Anthony thanks.  I did four good shows because I figured he'd be there at one of them.  He wasn't even at the fucking shows.  I fucking worked my ass off just because I figured he'd be at one of the shows.  He didn't even show up.  Tell that guinea cocksucker I was at the first fucking one, Friday night, the 8 o'clock show.  I went there.  Hey, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.  I went.  I fucking talked about it on this show.  How fucking funny it was. 
[01:39:30]  It was great.  He was lambasting some people in the audience and shit.  And I found it hysterical.  Well, I don't think that's a big show.  I just, what I didn't do was, and it was the 8 o'clock show I went to, so in between shows,  I don't like going back and fucking, you know, the guy's just resting.  He just did a whole fucking show.  Here?  He's resting here?  I don't feel like going back and doing the, hey, how you doing?  Great show kind of thing.  And being a person.  So I saw the show.  Yeah, I want to do the whole thing, like make the guy feel good about himself.  I want to get out of there and drink. 
[01:40:00]  I just want to, I want a free show and not even a thank you.  No, I paid.  Rotten person.  I paid.  I did pay.  I just want to squirrel away.  You paid?  Yeah, I don't want to.  You know what it is?  Why should two people get fucking a free seat?  You paid for anything.  Shut up.  Don't vote it for the rest of us.  It's not like a crazy amount of money.  You should get comped into that.  And if it wasn't, if I had set it up with Nick and said, Nick, I'm coming down on Friday  and stuff, he guaranteed he would have me hooked up and on a list.  Of course.  But I walked in, I fucking paid my money, of course. 
[01:40:30]  Did a part of you hope to be recognized that go, it's for you, Anthony, no chance.  No, I really, you know what?  A part of you, he's asking, of course.  Do you think a part of him was hoping he'd be recognized?  Yes, my wallet.  Well, your bank account now.  Oh, Chip.  That's kind of what I meant.  On a smaller scale, Chip.  Chip was on fire last night.  Oh, God, I bet.  You're a big fan of Chip, huh?  Just the walk from the cellar to his car, I was almost demoralized. 
[01:41:00]  Because Chip, it's not just Chip and himself, it's like he represents a whole subset of humanity  that's just fucking depressing, you know?  Yes!  And it's so many people like that.  They're not funny, but think they are.  Oh.  And then some, like, the president of Italy was in there with NYU dorms.  Yeah.  You were just talking about that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I would say that they'll probably eat a lot of pizzas.  Are you doing that?  It's a good joke.  I know it is.  You think he does go for pizza?  Well, the worst part was one of the Secret Service guys, like, recognized me, so I start  talking to him.  So I start riffing, of course, on Berlusconi and his teenage girls. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And I could just see Norton's disgusted look like he goes, come on, let's go.  And just walk away like, yeah.  Oh, shit.  He caught me being, like, comedian, like, hey, guys, Berlusconi.  I was like, Robin Williams, like, walking the street.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Stop trying to be.  I could see his disgusted look.  Stop trying to be water cooler talk at the station house.  Hey, guess who I saw?  Is that where the Secret Service hang out at the station house?  Exactly.  They certainly do.  I don't listen to you.  They go in.  Are you a fucking good?  Is there a kid on the desk with a backwards hat on and eating an ice cream cone?  Wait, was that really? 
[01:42:00]  I thought it was a local cop.  The station house.  I didn't know it was Secret Service.  Oh, well, I saw Colin Quinn the other day.  Let me tell you, he's funny.  Hey, Clancy, you saw him.  Station house.  I didn't realize it was Secret Service.  Secret Service?  Secret.  Secret Service?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what you want to do.  Start doing taxi driver fucking impressive.  Six-digit phone number you give him?  Yeah.  I like the fuck there's some terrible in New Jersey. 
[01:42:30]  That is great, man.  I have a fucking college.  What the fuck?  We got your old pal Norm MacDonald's coming up.  I know.  Norm MacDonald.  We've never talked to him, believe it or not.  All these years.  Yeah, all these years.  We've never had Norm on.  And he's been in twice.  It was so awkward.  Yeah, he just sat there.  Norm is into the Twitter thing now.  Oh, he's the king of Twitter.  And it's now, yeah, now he's the guy to follow.  And it started with the Oscars.  Yeah.  Because he just started tweeting during the Oscars.  And it spread like, I would say, wildfire.  Everybody was just like, you've got to follow fucking Norm. 
[01:43:00]  And it was hysterical.  And now everybody's following him.  He's got a lot of followers.  And he did the special.  He just did his special.  It was fucking hysterical.  It's good to see him back out in the public eye.  And isn't it funny that he just started Twittering and now he's just like 30 a day?  That's crazy, yeah.  How come you're not Twittering anymore?  I just noticed that you stopped Twittering.  Yeah, what happened?  Because the only time I was good at Twitter was talking about Chip.  And then I'd get all these people going, tsss.  And then when I Twittered on my own, I just felt like forced.  Like, I don't want to come up with some fucking... 
[01:43:30]  I mean, Norm's really good at it.  But it's like, you know, I don't know.  You'd be good at it, Carl.  Just do it.  I don't like doing it.  I tried to do it.  Just do it.  It's Twitter.  Just do it.  It's Twitter.  It can't be any worse than Steve Martin.  It's like an obligation.  You want to see Martin bed?  Oh, boy, is he bed.  He had his King Tut hat on yesterday.  Waiting for a call.  Waiting for the Egyptian Cobra.  So he could go up to the Bronx and get the Cobra.  He actually said, I'm waiting for the Egyptian Cobra.  I have my King Tut hat on.  And I'm waiting by the phone. 
[01:44:00]  Are you doing a Twitter callback from 35 fucking years ago?  I got an update on that.  CNN read that tweet and thought it was hilarious.  Of course they did.  And yesterday, we read that tweet and beat the shit out of him.  Of course they did.  So what's wrong with this picture?  I thought it was hilarious.  They thought it was hilarious.  They're like, even Steve Martin.  And they had it full screen on CNN and everything.  You've got to enjoy it.  Be a good sport.  They all show the tweets.  And you know the other thing about the Cobra?  You know it's a tiny little nothing of a snake and they're making it look like it's that 
[01:44:30]  big ass fucking Cobra that you see in the Indiana Jones movies.  It's a little Egyptian Cobra.  It's nothing.  Well, I don't know.  I've seen some snakes on dirty jobs that were pretty fucking big.  I didn't tweet for like 24 hours the other day.  Right.  And actually, people were ready to call like an ambulance or the police to come to the  house.  Like, whoa, Anthony hasn't tweeted in over 20 hours.  It's like, what?  Now you're obligated.  And I think that's what Colin's saying.  That's not what I'm saying at all.  I'm saying I suck at it or I do it all day. 
[01:45:00]  You don't suck at it.  There feels this obligation now to get a few in a day, whether they're clever or not.  You're just you have to put something down.  You don't have to, though.  No, I don't feel Twitter pressure.  That's why I don't feel it either.  But that's what like the that's what the thing is that's with with people that tweet.  They're like, oh, I have to just because I haven't.  Well, first of all, obviously, you do feel pressure.  And you just got through telling us a five minute story.  I already swamped you.  And this fool says one word and you go, oh, me neither. 
[01:45:30]  I don't feel pressure either.  No, I didn't feel.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I said I hadn't tweeted in 24 hours, but people feel I should.  And you feel pressure.  I don't feel I should.  No, no pressure.  Yes, you do.  You feel pressure to your fans.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No, I'm going to do now.  I'm tweeting the fact that you're telling me I feel pressure.  Tweet that he.  I don't like that.  Tweet that Colin Quinn's an asshole.  Colin Quinn.  That's Colin Quinn.  No, it's I am Colin Quinn is an asshole.  I am Colin Quinn.  I am Colin Quinn.  Like, that's a mighty statement.  I am.  How about we all tweet that right now?  We got a few listeners. 
[01:46:00]  I like the real, too.  When people call themselves the real somebody.  Well, I had to in my email because Jim Norton was taken.  What am I going to say?  I like the fact that he trashed it and you go, well, but I had to.  All kidding aside.  The real Jim Norton.  Lest you mistake this man.  That's right.  I understand.  That's right.  I'm a man of means.  Philip Drummond.  A man of means.  What the hell else?  Well, you tell us. 
[01:46:30]  What have you been up to, Colin?  Well, guys.  We're catching up with you.  I'm going out to L.A. next.  You're not going to be in L.A. next week.  You're doing an L.A. thing?  I'm going to.  I've never seen Jim Norton.  A couple of days.  But I'll be out there in a couple of weeks to do something.  For what?  What are you doing in L.A., Colin?  Just TV shows.  Which one is it?  Just to promote the show, but I figured if Norton was out there.  I've never seen Norton in L.A. really, you know.  Which shows?  It would be kind of fun, you know.  Which shows you got?  Conan, Bill Maher, TV, you know, morning TV, L.A.  You like the Bill Maher?  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  I don't really watch it, but.  I don't like him.  It doesn't like the Bill Maher.  Don't blow up Colin's spot, though.  I did like Religious.  I liked Religious, his movie about religion.  It was very good.  I like it.  I just didn't like the anti-religious parts of it.  Well, yeah.  I got a little sensitive there when he was talking about my religion.  It sounded too much like Ridiculous, too.  That's why I didn't like it.  Thanks a lot, Roland.  Look at this.  Did you see Religious, Colin?  No.  Yeah, it's good.  You like it.  It's good.  Yeah.  Smart.  It's just him talking about religion and how ridiculous it is and how everybody will cling 
[01:47:30]  to this notion of just this fairytale thing and really get defensive if you even talk about  it.  They're talking about the Bronx Zoo Cobra on TV.  Sorry to interrupt.  Of course they are.  And there's a snake handler.  Isn't there a meltdown happening?  Isn't there a fucking three wars?  Welcome to the show.  How are you doing?  First off, there's no getting a python in here?  There's a baby python in there.  This is relevant to the size, roughly to the size of the Egyptian Cobra that's missing  at the zoo.  Where's this guy from?  Is this an animal wrangler? 
[01:48:00]  Guaranteed he's from Long Island.  This guy.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed he's from Long Island.  It's nice to make light of it the way everybody is, but I mean, it's a very serious thing.  He's from Bayshore.  Whoa!  Sure enough.  He's from Bayshore.  He's highly venomous.  This snake is harmless.  You can get it at any pet shop throughout New York.  What's his name?  We've got to get his name to look him up and see where he's fucking from.  You said relatively harmless.  Because this guy is definitely from Long Island.  It's harmless.  It's harmless.  Okay.  It's harmless.  It's harmless.  Nice.  It's harmless.  This is about the same size.  Yeah, he's from like a town who's like into the dead.  The girth of this snake.  He's like...  So the Cobra that's missing could just about squeeze through anything, which is probably... 
[01:48:30]  They're really doing stories on the missing Cobra?  Yeah.  That fucking thing is...  Eh, fuck Japan.  You know, ah, stories late.  Come on, let's all take guesses before we look them up.  Oh, right.  I'm saying Bayshore.  What are you saying?  He's a North Shore guy.  North Shore?  Yeah, he is.  With that fucking...  I'm going Queens.  Fabio head?  Colmack!  Colmack.  We don't mention Colmack enough on this show.  All right.  I'm going to go with Hampton Bays because I feel like with his long hair...  Hampton Bays.  I know it's a crazy gasp, but, you know... 
[01:49:00]  I say Queens.  They're going to say his name, and then I'm sure if you just pop him up on...  What do you do?  You work on movies?  You work on television shows?  On television shows?  Yep.  Really?  They showed his name.  Yeah.  Steve Irwin, a crocodile hunter.  Hunter.  Sherm Carlson.  I have his little...  Oh, Jim, government guzzlers.  Don't you have that movie?  They'll say, we want to thank...  Blah, blah, blah.  It could kill somebody or not.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It could kill you.  You know, almost like a baby.  A baby or an adult, same venom, you know? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, boy.  So, yeah, about 15 minutes for a human.  I've got to get to Bird's Place in Ronkonkoma.  My chick is dancing.  It can, but I would think it's going to be seen by...  John...  John Brennan.  B-R-E-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A.  It's an animal wrangler.  Sorry.  B-R-E-N-A-N-A-N-A-N.  Animals and rumps.  All snakes are perfect escape artists.  He said escape artists, not escape.  They're perfect escape artists.  Depending out of anything. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, huh?  It could be a screw-up.  Let's put the little one away, and the next one's a big one.  That was the name of the guy from the Jerky Boys, John Brennan.  John Brennan.  That's right.  Oh, man.  John Brennan.  I see a...  Animal Wrangler.  We got him?  Well, that's the guy.  Is he from Little Ferry, New Jersey?  Or that's where he lives now?  Shit.  Is he on Wikipedia?  His accent, there's no way that's a Jersey accent.  Is he Wikipedia?  That's a Long Island accent.  It really is.  I said Queens.  His business seems to be located... 
[01:50:30]  Well, get his bio.  He should be a...  Yeah, where's his bio, man?  Yeah, because Colin Quinn loves Long Island.  Get his bio.  It's important.  It really is.  I can't get enough of Long Island.  I tell you, I was on Fallon spewing every Long Island reference.  Shout-outs.  No port, quorum, everywhere.  And what did he do?  Just stared at you?  Just sat there and kind of caggled.  IMDB?  Is that him?  Who's booking Fallon now?  Who's booking Fallon?  I mean, John Brennan's going to be...  There's going to be quite a few, I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How great would it be if he was bitten and killed on this show? 
[01:51:00]  Animal Wrangler.  But then there's an IMDB link for Animal Wrangler.  Oh, please.  John Brennan down a little further.  Right there.  Down, down there.  Is that him?  Are we still doing this?  Probably.  I mean, I don't know what kind of info you...  Is there a bio?  There's no bio?  Because sometimes there's a bio.  Animal Trainer?  Why don't we just call him?  You never know.  Call him and say, where'd you grow up?  Fuck you.  Don't give us that little furry New Jersey shit.  Yeah.  8 to 10 feet, but now he's looking more like 13 feet.  You mentioned you can tell when they're happy or not happy.  How's this one?  Yeah, they're not happy when they're squeezing your fucking intestines out of your ass. 
[01:51:30]  And if you look close, Greg, he's missing an eye.  Whoa, yes, he is.  It looks like he was born that way, though.  Actually, he wasn't.  He was...  You asshole.  It's like it was born that way.  They left a live rat in there with him, and it took his eye out when he was a baby.  You said you rescued him.  A lot of folks try to keep something like this as a pet.  They don't know what they're doing.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's a big problem.  It wasn't a big problem.  Yeah.  But now more and more people are getting out of trying to keep animals like this.  I've had it with this guy.  I've had it with him and his dumb snake. 
[01:52:00]  Stupid snake.  Enough with big snakes.  I hate people that walk around with snakes.  Oh, I'd like to be weird.  Exactly.  Sorry.  How about a wildebeest?  Carry one of those on your back.  I'd love a photo with a wildebeest.  Yeah, I'm sick of that guy, and I'm just saying he is from Long Island.  I don't know where he's from.  But the other anchor's getting involved now.  This could get a little crazy for everybody.  Exact luck.  This is getting crazy.  Public slithers right up her dress.  Did you see what happened to that Israeli model with the snake?  What?  Bitter clit.  Bitter tit. 
[01:52:30]  And then bitter implant tit.  And then the snake died, right?  I'm sorry.  I'm a little uneasy around this game.  Meanwhile, the whole time Norton's trashing this, I'm just imagining him and Jay would  like some koala bear.  Whoa!  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  That's right.  I would run.  Jay, this thing's a little crazy.  Go on, Jim.  Don't be scared.  Jay will play it.  These things are harmless.  It's supposed to be harmless or something.  It doesn't look harmless to me, Jay.  Exactly what I'd say.  Jim would play his part.  Jim, you might want to take this off my shoulder, Jim.  I'm not touching it, Jay.  You're crazy.  You make the big bucks.  I'm not touching it. 
[01:53:00]  We're working it out right here for you.  Band leader laugh shot.  I don't know.  You get to get some of those.  I want to see Chip on Jay.  I've been on already, stupid.  No, you haven't.  Yes, I have.  No, it hasn't.  I see the Tonight Show, but they're showing us at the 12, it's tomorrow.  And then you're watching it.  It's like a big loop and he's laughing.  I want you to have the balls to go into Jay next week and sit down and go, Jay, guess  what?  We're having fun.  I have a character I want to do on the show.  I don't introduce characters like that. 
[01:53:30]  They just come out.  No.  I want you to go to Jay and go, Jay, I want you to introduce Chip, Chip or something.  Why don't you introduce him on Conan first and we'll see how that goes.  I will gladly.  You talk about Chip on Conan and I'll do him on Jay.  All right.  He's going to do it.  You know Colin will.  Colin will do it.  I know.  Colin will.  And I know I won't.  He's like that.  That's the beauty of it.  I love Chip.  Hey, we got the answer to where he's from.  Where?  Brian in North Carolina.  I don't know how Brian knows, but...  How does he know?  Hi, fuckers.  I just know for a fucking fact that John Brennan is from Hicksville and every time 
[01:54:00]  scenes from an Italian restaurant comes on, he gets super fucking pumped.  Hicksville.  Fucking Hicksville.  It is true.  That's a little dude of Colin, man.  I love when he's on and he makes fun of Long Island Town.  It just fucking makes him crack up.  But he's got a good point, which is that the reverence for Billy Joel is a little nauseating.  It's crazy.  We don't have anything else, Colin.  Yeah.  Who else do we have?  Pat Benatar.  Twisted Sister.  Eddie Money.  A little Zebra action. 
[01:54:30]  Zebra.  That's it.  That's all we got.  Hallecon.  Yeah.  Hallecon.  Rat Race Choir.  Ryan Starr.  Rat Race Choir.  Ryan Starr.  Come on.  Ryan Starr.  Pepe Marcello.  Rat Race Choir.  What about...  Good Rats.  That was a Good Rats.  Yeah, who was in Rat Race?  Good Rats.  Who was in Rat Race Choir?  I have no idea.  I think Rat Race Choir was the Yes cover band.  No, wait.  What was the other band from fucking...  Oh, that was Crystal Ship.  Oh, no, it was Doris.  Crystal Ship.  What was the other fucking Long Island band?  Rotgut.  Rotgut?  Yeah, you asshole.  That's a good spirit. 
[01:55:00]  I think it was a band called Rotgut.  It was mandatory.  You had to be in a band.  I promise you I'll bring up Chip Chipperson on Conan, but we got to think of the context  of it.  I know.  I wouldn't have the balls to do it, Andre.  Come on, it'd be so funny.  It would be for us.  No one in that audience would enjoy it.  If Jay shoots in fucking...  If he does a show in Staten Island, I'll be happy to do it.  Can you imagine Chip at some convention or something?  It would be so creepy.  That is true.  Not the couch, but you're doing a...  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Not on the couch.  It's like, hey, how you doing? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, like just one of those...  We hear at the Consumer Electronics Show and there's things they plug in.  Yes.  You know?  We're doing this here at Spring Break.  Feels more like a summer to me, though.  I'm just pausing for the laugh.  See, it would work.  It works here.  It should work on Leno.  There's Anthony's old band.  You never saw this?  You never saw it?  Live at the Apollo.  And you a singer?  Yeah, yeah.  The guy with Harold Ramis hair in the middle.  Oh, my God, Anthony.  Yes. 
[01:56:00]  That's pretty horrendous.  Yeah, we're all in blackface.  Very politically incorrect.  Oh, we're out on the edge then.  Why is your face blacker than the rest of the band?  Yeah.  Is it an ego thing?  You had to be blacker?  Yeah, yeah.  Was it in your contract?  I was like the Al Jolson and the other guys were the, you know, they were the bit players  around Al Jolson.  Were they...  Also, I also have a white hat.  Did you play any...  They were scared to commit, those guys.  They knew they were going to go back to regular jobs and knew that...  Oh, they knew I was going to radio?  Yeah.  This is well before radio. 
[01:56:30]  They weren't willing to commit to the character.  Tin-knocking Anthony.  And the whole play on words, live at the Apollo, and instead of the Apollo Theater in the  background, it's the Saturn V Apollo rocket taking off Bound for the Moon.  See, that's the twist.  And what kind of songs do you guys do?  It was a big chili pepper ripoff.  Was it really?  Yeah.  You got some?  No.  You got to let me hear one.  No.  Oh, this is Naked Cowboy.  Well, I'd rather be in the news.  Yeah, man.  I just wear my boots.  My cow work with their suits.  It rocks to my book with black and blue. 
[01:57:00]  It's always goof, you know.  Well, I want to be a naked cowboy.  This was Naked Cowboy before there was a Naked Cowboy.  Oh, really?  I should sue him, right?  Yeah.  And you know who he's been fighting with me years.  Yes.  Sandy Kane.  She won.  She won.  She won the fucking...  We haven't even talked about it.  Fucking Sandy Kane won the lawsuit.  I think it was last week or the week before that, and she won.  She fucking won.  Let's not forget, she was the one who made the famous statement one day when I was on  a break, and she goes, hey, Opie, you want a blowjob? 
[01:57:30]  And he goes, ew, no.  And instead of being like humiliated, I thought it was like a sad movie, she goes, what are  you, gay?  She was so, so confident.  She was amazed that someone would turn her down.  She has no clue what she looks like.  And isn't she the reason that Jim quit smoking?  Because of twatting?  No.  No.  Wait, it's a serious moment.  No.  No.  There's a lot of things we joke about on this program. 
[01:58:00]  We don't joke about that.  Hey, no.  No.  Oh, Colin.  Too soon.  Yeah, too soon, Colin.  Too soon.  My lungs are no laughing matter.  That's right.  Your lips are God's ears.  And this guy, we don't have time, but he wants everyone to know there's 100,000 rattlesnakes  loose in California, but New York loses their shit over one dumb fucking cobra.  Yeah, they fucking live there.  We have one snake that can kill you.  They have hundreds of thousands out there.  And then one's talking about the snakes.  You should do a John Brennan reality show. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  The snake catcher.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  He just runs over them on the bike.  Yeah.  Bisects them.  Whatever.  I'm going to be over at Westbury Music Fair talking about fucking snakes.  One man's show with a snake.  Now, Rocco would be at Frank Cariola's.  The Roxy.  Yeah, the Roxy.  Or Mad Hatteras, Stony Brook.  Or fucking Huey's.  80s night.  80s night.  Where was 80s night?  Huey's.  My father's place. 
[01:59:00]  My father's place.  Under the viaduct in Roslyn.  I told you about the time we had a big...  There was a big riot at the Ramones.  Oh, were you there?  Was that...  I don't think I was there.  You spent a lot of time on Long Island when you were younger?  Yeah, we used to go out there all the time.  That was the place to be.  That was the place to be.  Yeah.  That was the place to be.  Did you vacation on Long Island?  Yeah.  Not really, but...  Baby Huey's.  We would go there all the time, me and my friends, and go like...  OBI.  Yeah, we hit all the bars.  Penrods.  Penrods.  And Malibu. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Malibu.  I still say I saw the stray cats.  Yeah, that was 80s now.  But I think that was just one of those things that everybody thought they did, or someone  said it.  I think somebody said it, and then I lied and said it happened to me, you know?  And then it just becomes fact.  Yeah, I was like, yeah, the stray cats, and now I even believe it.  Even if you did, who gives a shit, really?  What's that?  Even if you did, who cares?  The stray cats?  That's not true.  Stray cats were big.  How about the Rum Run O' Voice to Bay?  Rum Warners.  The Rum Run O' Voice to Bay.  And Spit. 
[02:00:00]  I remember when the world started changing, when Spit was like this punk club.  That was a punk club down there, and where was it?  Long Beach, somewhere around there?  No, I think it was a massive peak.  What is Malibu?  Is that a place that's like a, is it by a beach?  Is it by a beach?  It's right by, it was right by my father's, but it was on, it was close.  I think a shore bar.  Oh, fuck.  There's a, how do you miss Hammerheads?  Hammerheads.  Hammerheads.  Hammer.  You had to say hammer.  Sharks were hanging up all over the place.  It looked like you were in a big aquarium.  And then there was a Cheers on Deer Park Avenue.  That was another one.  That's right. 
[02:00:30]  Sparks was down the road.  T.J. Spratz.  Yeah.  Where did Robbie Krieger play?  God, there were a lot of fucking places to go on Long Island.  And where did Robbie Krieger play?  Hey, well, there's a lot of people.  Oh, shit.  He played the same place you did.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  Robbie Krieger from the Doors.  There was another place South Shore.  There was an Islander game going on, and they had the pool tables going, and you couldn't  even hear Robbie Krieger, because the game was on louder than the music.  And I'm sitting there going, it's the, he's from the fucking,  The Doors, give a little respect.  That happened once.  And it was a tiny little place.  We were playing the same place once. 
[02:01:00]  Just playing a bar gig.  And they would keep the TV on, you know, but you couldn't hear the TV over the band.  And a fucking Islander, because there was an Islander play, so they would just kick the  fucking Islander game on.  Always had the game on.  And the end of one of our songs coincided perfectly with the fucking Islander goal.  With Pod Van Sucks.  Yeah, Pod Van Sucks.  With a chant.  And so we stopped the fucking song, and everyone goes, yeah!  And for two seconds, we're like, wow, this is great.  And then we look up, and they're all not even looking at us.  They're looking up at the TV going, yeah, fuck it!  They scored a goal. 
[02:01:30]  I was like, what are we doing here?  But for two seconds, I was like, nice!  Fuck it.  Oh, that's right.  We suck, and they don't like us.  That's just depressing.  Oh, it was.  That reminds me of so many bad Jersey bars.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Fuck does that bring back memories, man.  New Jersey and Long Island are like fucking conjoined twins.  Just hell gigs.  Cousins.  They're cousins.  They are cousins.  Yeah.  Same shit.  Because they don't like each other, but they don't realize how similar they are.  Just rotten gigs.  Yeah.  Fucking terrible. 
[02:02:00]  We got a DJ from...  We used to call bad gigs, we'd look at a place and go like, we would just look at  each other and go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  And what that meant was, you would drive up, look at the club, and instead of even stopping  and unloading the shit and playing, you just beep the horn a few times and keep driving  like, nah, nah, nah, we pass by, fuck you, that you guys never do.  Oh, you guys didn't do it?  It blows.  Yeah, yeah.  There were a couple of nah, nah, nah, nahs.  There were no cars in the parking lot yet?  No cars.  The place is empty.  We went into one gig once, and there was this band, I swear, they were dressed like fucking... 
[02:02:30]  They were Klingons or some shit, and the drummer had a kit that looked like he literally  took a monkey bar set from a schoolyard, put it on the stage, and fastened the drum  to every single fucking bar on the thing.  And the club owner's like, yeah, they're going for about 15 minutes more, and then there's  one other band, and then you go up.  And I'm thinking, you know how long it's going to take this drummer to even strike that fucking  kit?  Turn around, nah, nah, nah, nah, get the fuck out of here. 
[02:03:00]  And there were so many gigs like that.  Hey, we got a guy, he's really mad because we're getting all the bars wrong and where they're  located.  Joe's going to set us straight.  Joe on Long Island.  This will mean nothing for the rest of the country.  Whatever.  They got their own bars in town.  Get some Long Island, man, but you got...  Uncle Sam's and Spit was the same place.  Spit was the back door.  Oh.  Uncle Sam's and Spit.  And that was by governors, right?  By governors.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That was in Levittown.  Yeah, by governors, right around the corner.  There was an older Spit, though, my friend.  There was an older Spit?  Yeah, there was a Spit that was on the South Shore. 
[02:03:30]  No.  Don't try to win the argument.  Just the guy's right.  All right, Spit and Uncle Sam's.  My father's place was on the North Shore, and Malibu was on Lido Beach.  Lido Beach, that's right.  All right.  He's setting us straight.  Oh, no, that place in Lido Beach.  I think Lido Beach turned into...  What about the big scandal with my father's place?  Let's face it, there's a lot of...  That's a book, right?  That's another Goodfellas right there.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened there?  Is it still in existence?  No.  Ask him.  Yeah, what happened with my father's place, Joe? 
[02:04:00]  What happened with my father's place?  We lost him.  We got a DJ that used to work in Malibu.  That guy was pissed off, too.  He was pissed.  Get your fucking name wrong at clubs from 25 years ago.  This is homecoming.  This is homecoming for us now.  We got Peter, who used to be a DJ in Malibu.  Peter, he's in Arizona now.  Stray Cats.  Stray Cats.  How are you doing, guys?  Is Malibu still there?  No, none of them.  No, it's not there.  It's changed hands.  None of these players.  I was a DJ in a lot of those clubs back in my college days.  Yeah.  And what about the Stray Cats? 
[02:04:30]  I was definitely in Lido Beach, though.  Were the Stray Cats there in Malibu?  They had a lot of bands.  When they were first starting out, would come into Malibu and start out, because it was  like the big thing back then, was the play at Malibu.  I mean, if you were starting out and you were in New York, it was one of the places you  went to.  I don't know why.  Long Island was a place that, if you had a band back then, there were so many places  to play and get ripped off by the scumbag club owners.  All the club owners were in the mob.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  It was all mobbed up.  And it was always, L.I.R. was a great radio station.  Right.  So all the bands would go, hey, this sounds like a great place.  And they come in here, the guy's like, yeah, we didn't make any money.  Sorry, kid.  How many people?  You didn't really bring any people.  He had some fucking jamoke at the door with a counter, not counting anything.  Yeah, we got like 20 people.  You drank some beers.  You did that.  And you're like, ah, we're leaving with no money.  Yeah, you had that happen again so many times.  Yeah.  Anthony, John Brennan is from Long Island.  He used to work at the Reptile Museum in Hicksville. 
[02:05:30]  So the guy was partially correct.  All right.  See, I just fucking.  Damn it.  You could tell.  You could hear Hicksville.  But none of us are right about where he's from.  No, no.  Hicksville is right in the middle there, too.  Yeah, Hicksville, nobody gets pregnant.  Well, we don't know where he's from yet.  That's TBT.  That's very judicious of you.  TBT.  Might have just worked there.  We're going to go with Hicksville now.  I can send you the high school yearbook.  He went to Lawrence High School in the Five Towns where I went.  Oh, okay.  Five Towns.  Could be a big fucking score for you.  All right.  Fucking Five Towns.  Five Towns.  Thanks, Peter. 
[02:06:00]  I love the local commercials.  I learned music at Five Towns.  It's like, yeah, where'd you go?  How many Five Towns graduates do you know that went anywhere?  You guys want a story about Jay Spratz?  Jay Spratz.  TJ Spratz.  Do you remember Spratz?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  What do you got, brother?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Love you.  Love the show.  Of course you do.  It wasn't TJ Spratz.  It was Jay Spratz.  Jay Spratz.  And I used to bar back there during a couple of summers, which basically consisted of me  drinking with the owner.  And the owner was his guy named Frankie B, whose father gave Henry Hill his no-show job 
[02:06:30]  at Channel 80 down in Island Park.  Channel 80?  After he got out of jail.  They were all mobbed up, these guys.  Does this make sense to anyone?  Yes, totally.  What's Channel 80?  That was that other bar in Lito.  Was that Lito Beach Show?  Channel 80 was a bar down in Island Park.  It became Jay Spratz.  Now, I don't even know what it is now.  Patty McGee's.  It became Patty McGee's. 
[02:07:00]  I think after Jay Spratz on the water.  It's just a multitude of these places.  I used to fight from Jay Spratz on the water all the time, and I think Mark Gastineau  got arrested there once.  Oh, yeah.  That was during the time when Gastineau would be roaming around Long Island just getting  arrested at all these bars.  That's right.  And Jerry Cooney.  Yeah, Cooney was out, too.  Cooney would wander around.  Well, he used to own that bar.  Cooney, you see, he's doing a little sports bar, right?  It's so sad.  I was just remembering when I was trying to have happy memories of all these new clubs when 
[02:07:30]  they opened, like Channel 80.  And I just remember going, like, loser friends.  And we'd be all dressed up like we were, like, and we barely, we just got assholes.  Hey, not on the town.  We barely had enough to buy, like, a couple of, we just got assholes that didn't even  want there.  We weren't losers.  It's Colin and his boys doing the Long Island scene.  But it's not like we had, like, Coke, but we thought we did.  Like, somebody had, like, a quarter gram of Coke.  Colin's going to the back door with fucking baby Hueys. 
[02:08:00]  Through the basement.  He don't wait up front.  Holy shit.  That's so sad.  Like, you go in there like, yeah, we're going to have a big night this night, you know.  A big night out on the town.  Yeah.  Friday night was the night for the wives and girlfriends.  Saturday was the night for me and the boys, though.  One day, I remember, Pepe Marcello from the Good Rats sent us down a bottle of Miller Genuine 
[02:08:30]  Draft.  Oh, shit, man.  And then Spider came in and he got shot by his friends.  Chip.  Chip.  Chip.  Chip.  I think we should make T-shirts Chip Strikes again.  That's great.  Fucking Long Island.  I love that shit, man.  That's so funny. 
[02:09:00]  This guy on Twitter writes, irony of the day, Colin starts all this Long Island talk.  It calls you guys tedious.  The balls on this guy.  The balls.  Didn't you call us from down the hall and say that we're being tedious today?  Yes, but we're talking tedious.  And now we got this Long Island horse shit we're talking about?  First of all, just for that last fucking bit alone.  It's true.  We brought it together.  It's well worth it.  We brought it together.  You know what it is with people, and I understand this.  The whole local thing versus national because we're on a national platform.  But everything.  And the specific is the universal.  Yeah, you know, the names are one thing, the towns are another, but you've all been to 
[02:09:30]  these places.  Yes.  So fucking, you've all had these experiences.  What do you think?  Colin was the only dickbag dressed to the nines of the time in his fucking shitty Long Island  club.  Oh, my God.  In his Sid's pants suit.  Going to fucking, going to these great clubs.  Would you wear a tie?  No, I don't think it was that.  Skinny tie?  Skinny tie?  Oh, my God.  It was like, no, I wouldn't wear a skinny tie, but I had like this jacket, and it was  all purpose.  Like fucking early 80s. 
[02:10:00]  Lapels?  No, it was like a short jacket, almost like a, you know, like a bolero type jacket.  Oh, shit.  Styling.  I would just go in, yeah, and I was styling my fucking hair, and I had a mullet mustache.  No.  That was before the mullet.  You were doing well.  Oh, yeah, this was way before the mullet.  And I just come strutting in with my friends, like, hey, this is it.  Hey.  And you got to look around, like, hey, where are the chicks?  We're all looking for chicks.  Mustache.  Jerk.  Yeah, it's a jerk.  Oh, my God.  Have a mustache.  Mustache, totally.  I had like a fucking...  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Look at these guys.  What are these pictures?  This is the Facebook club, Long Island Clubs from the 80s.  Travis, Long Island Clubs from the 80s?  This is perfect.  This is exactly what we're talking about.  This is great.  Oh, shit.  Any one of us could be in one of these pictures.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, this is the exact...  Look how shitty the clubs looked.  All the guys are like, yeah.  Look at him in his stripe.  He's wearing a Frankie Says shirt under his members-only jacket.  It says, who gives a fuck what Frankie Says?  Oh, there you go. 
[02:11:00]  That's like fucking...  What kind of town is that guy from, Colin?  Yeah.  Definitely Franklin Square or Island Park.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  I had a Send Rambo to Lebanon shirt.  Send Rambo to Lebanon?  Hey, yeah.  That'll show him.  Send Rambo to Lebanon, motherfucker.  What is this Facebook page again?  Because this brings the whole bit together for the people.  This is Long Island Clubs from the 80s.  Oh, boy.  Damn.  They were proud of their clubs.  It's great. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, and every guy looked the same, man.  Oh, God.  Uncle Sam's.  There it is.  That was right there.  Damn.  What are some of those bands?  Sundance.  Go back to the one you were just at.  Look at Sundance.  Jack Bruce from Cream was there.  Yeah, because there was always that other thing.  Warzone.  Where you felt like, hey, I'm a real music lover.  Yeah, because there...  I'll go see Jack Bruce.  Yeah.  I'll go see Jack Cassidy, you know.  God damn.  I'm going to go see fucking Cintron. 
[02:12:00]  Where's George Cintron now?  Holy shit.  Or like Leo Kotke if you were really like, hey, man, I really know guitar.  What about Randy Jackson doing the whole thing?  One man show.  One man zebra show.  What?  You never saw Randy Jackson do the one man zebra show?  Because he didn't want to pay the guys anymore?  No.  Oh, man.  You never saw that?  Yeah, yeah.  He's behind the drums and he's got a guitar.  Yeah, he would sample shit and...  Oh, man.  You missed out.  Hey, I'm going to go see Soft White Underbelly at Hammerheads and you know who that is, don't 
[02:12:30]  you?  Blue Eyes to Cull.  B.O.C.  Motherfucker.  Really?  Yeah.  Blue Eyes to Cull used to go out to the clubs and play small venues under Soft White Underbelly.  What else we got?  Channel 80.  Rocked.  Yeah.  A VIP Channel 80 fucking sticker.  It really is a good...  All that shit is Goodfellas.  All those...  All those clubs.  Oh, yeah.  They were all those clubs and they all just...  They all died under mysterious circumstances.  Yeah.  I remember Sparks literally burst into flames.  That whole place burnt down.  Oh, yeah.  I did a few gigs there.  My father's... 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  I did a few gigs at Sparks.  Uh-huh.  Where was that again?  That was on...  Sparks?  Deer Park Avenue?  That was Deer Park Avenue across the street from Cheers and a little...  I did some gigs.  ...down the road.  Just Deer Park Avenue alone just gives you an image.  A vivid image.  You mean Babylon Speedway?  That place was...  Hey, let's go down to Babylon Speedway!  That place was supposed to burn down.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Deer Park Avenue is where every fucking muscle head took his muscle car and raced other people  and just drove around in circles like it was American graffiti. 
[02:13:30]  Chevys?  Chevys was Hammerheads.  Turned into Chevys.  Chevys was in Bayshore, my friends.  But Hammerheads wound up turning into Chevys.  I think the original Chevys went away and Hammerheads changed its name.  I don't know.  That's where I went and saw the Opie look-alike contest on my fucking...  I came out from seeing something, some band, and in my windshield was a flyer for, I guess  it was BAB, and I pulled the flyer out, and there was a picture of Opie on there, and  it was like, come to some club for the Opie look-alike contest. 
[02:14:00]  It was Chevys.  It was Chevys, yeah.  Come to Chevys for the Opie look-alike contest.  And I'm looking, and I just remember...  And this is me, so wow, everybody else was a really fucking...  I just remember taking it and going, ugh, and rumbled it up and threw it away.  Yeah, you did.  What was first prize then?  Like a hundred bucks?  Yeah, probably.  The funny part is...  Plastic surgery.  No one knew what I looked like.  I was a night DJ.  How the fuck would they even care?  No one would even know what you looked like. 
[02:14:30]  First of all, you'd have to care.  That's not happening.  And then you would have to know what I looked like.  It was a big bust.  It was a big bust.  It was a big bust.  It was a big bust.  It was a big bust.  Yeah, sales.  I like the fact he still remembers the name.  It was a bust.  It was a bust.  It was a bust.  How many people showed up?  I swear to God.  More than a hundred?  No way.  Twenty guys.  Twenty guys.  They would just be there to drink anyway.  Yeah, and they probably had all the shit going on.  Like tickets to see Zebra or something, you know.  I saw Buckman a few times at Cheers.  He was hosting events.  And he used to be able to bring in a good crowd if there was a pretty decent band there. 
[02:15:00]  They brought in good crowds for Long Island.  Yeah, BAB was like the Long Island station.  They knew how to get people to the clubs.  Yeah, and there were plenty of clubs and plenty of drunks.  I remember not worrying or minding that I was driving like 50 miles from Huntington out  East to go to some club and drink like a motherfucker and then just hop in the car and drive home  without thinking that you'd ever get a Dewey or anything like that.  It was a different time.  You know, Colin, different times. 
[02:15:30]  How about Greg Buttle?  Didn't he have that club?  I think I did comedy.  Like all these Jets.  All the Jets were like partial owners of these little strip mall bars.  The mob guys would get them involved somehow.  Greg Buttle.  Greg Buttle.  Yeah, the mob guys would get these big southern boys to put their names on the club.  Yeah, put your name on the club.  Hey, you know, you make a few dollars.  And maybe, you know, maybe you could have some of your other football friends come in.  I imagine Greg Buttle is still paying to this day.  It was like Midnight Cowboy.  For getting involved with this guy.  Come on, come on.  I was like, yes, sir. 
[02:16:00]  Okay, ratso.  Greg Buttle.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he had a club.  They all had these Long Island clubs where you do comedy.  Greg Buttle was like Huntington Station.  Oh, no, that was Boozer had a club at Huntington Station.  Emerson Boozer.  Emerson Boozer.  Emerson Boozer.  Another ex-Jet that got stuck with some people maybe he didn't want to be with.  Large turnaround.  We should break because we're going to have Norm MacDonald here.  Norm.  And then Brock Lesnar.  Probably back to back.  Where's Norm from, by the way?  Canada.  Oh, he's Canadian, right?  He's the least Canadian Canadian.  Canada Canadian. 
[02:16:30]  He's the least Canadian, right?  Maybe.  Yeah, he should.  You stay.  You guys know each other.  You stay.  I know Norm, but I don't know who I want to say when Brock Lesnar gets here.  He's going to be all the crowd in here.  Oh, boy.  Hey, he's pretty big.  Colin, you've got to stay because we don't know much about Norm.  We want to make sure it goes well.  But here it is.  Colin Quinn, long story short, premieres on HBO next Saturday night at 10 p.m.  Twitter that he should be doing, but he doesn't.  Maybe he'll start up again.  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  I'm going to go to break with a little piece from your one-man show.  Oh, brother.  So maybe you don't want to hear this.  How come?  We're going to play a track called Working in America. 
[02:17:00]  Not that one.  Here's the great Colin Quinn.  We send all our jobs overseas while people come over here from overseas looking for jobs here.  But people still risk their lives every day coming over here climbing mountains, scaling walls, running roads to get a job at one of our gyms, picking up our towels, watching us climb fake mountains, scale fake walls, run fake roads.  They probably think we're making fun of them, but we're not. 
[02:17:30]  We're just doing what we do, reenacting life as we live it.  All right, we got Colin Quinn in studio.  Norm MacDonald should be here in minutes, hopefully.  And then Brock Lesnar at 930, I guess. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Jimmy's not in studio right now.  Where is he?  I don't want...  Can you hear this?  I don't know.  I told Colin not to mess with the Brock Lesnar interview because Norton's taking it very seriously.  He's got a folder on his computer, the Brock Lesnar interview.  Yeah.  He's been working on his questions.  He wants his questions to be perfect.  That's great.  Because Jimmy, really, I like MMA.  So do I.  But Jimmy really likes the MMA.  I think that's great to have somebody you really love like that.  He's obsessed.  And also, he made Club Soda Kenny get MMA gloves because he likes the guys to sign the MMA gloves. 
[02:18:30]  That's great.  So I told Colin, don't mess with his MMA gloves.  And as we sit here...  Hold on.  Yeah.  So we got Brock Lesnar coming in in a half hour.  We're waiting for Norm MacDonald.  Great.  So are you set for the Brock Lesnar interview, Jimmy?  I was telling Colin...  What, have you got questions?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  I know that they're...  I think I have a few questions for him.  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  Did you ever hit somebody so hard you thought they might die? 
[02:19:00]  That's professional.  Yeah.  He should be...  I think Brock will be a fun interview.  Yeah.  I think so, too.  Totally.  He sounds like...  From the last interview I heard with him...  Of course, it wasn't us.  But he sounded very well-spoken.  Yeah.  Very intelligent.  Not like a jamoke, as I like to call big, burly guys that can't really talk to each other.  Yeah.  He'll be fine.  And don't mess with Jimmy's picture.  He's going to get a picture with Brock Lesnar.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I already have a picture with Brock.  Oh.  Is that where you're going to get signed? 
[02:19:30]  I want to get it signed, yeah.  Do you have it?  Is that it?  I already know that something happened while I was gone.  No.  Let me say this.  I'm sure...  Nothing happened while you were gone.  No, I swear.  No one's going to fuck with your pictures.  Yeah.  See, the picture's fine.  Look.  See?  You got a picture you're going to get signed.  And then me and my nephew...  My nephew has one, too.  Yeah.  So I got my nephew who was coming in to meet Brock.  Colin wouldn't do anything to you, man.  Colin's awful.  He would certainly humiliate me.  You got your picture.  See?  Nothing happened.  I don't know what it is.  He's like something from...  He did something to my beverage. 
[02:20:00]  He's like the turtle song.  He's like Salazzo.  He's like...  Salazzo.  Salazzo.  You think too much of me.  Too much of me.  I'm the hunted one.  Don't be so...  I can't even drink my iced latte.  Don't be so...  No, I don't touch it.  I swear.  No.  Don't be so paranoid, you jabroni.  Yeah, you're paranoid.  Jabroni.  Colin didn't do nothing.  You see?  You got your picture and you got your interview.  Everything's set.  Everything's good.  Everything's set.  See?  What else could there be?  What else could there be?  You think I don't know?  You don't know.  Of course I do.  What do you know? 
[02:20:30]  That they're missing.  What's missing?  The gloves by my feet.  I knew they'd be missing.  Something's missing.  The gloves are missing.  What were you going to do with the gloves?  I was going to get to sign one to me.  You should have got me to sign one.  I don't like...  I was just...  Actually, I wasn't going to do anything, but it's not trying to bust your balls.  It's just I'm offended that you didn't have a list of...  A little folder with questions for me today.  I don't need the questions.  I don't need the questions.  I have something for me to sign.  I'm like a long story short CD.  I would love you to sign something, but you just won't.  Colin, where's his gloves?  I'm sure they threw them out. 
[02:21:00]  Let's see.  I know where they're at, Jack.  Oh, there they are.  What a shock.  What a shock.  What a shock.  I guess we've all known each other too long.  Where would they be?  They don't even go.  Surprised you didn't put my laptop in there.  Whoa.  Colin, you're lazy.  You could have thrown them somewhere else.  Where the hell was I going to throw them?  The garbage is the right place for them.  He knew what to do with them.  That was the correct move.  I was explaining to Colin that you're taking the interview very seriously, and then, of  course, Colin has to blow up your spot and throw your gloves away, Jim. 
[02:21:30]  It just aggravates me.  Brock's a tough one to get.  He's a very tough guy to get in the studio for radio interview.  He doesn't do a lot of radio.  No.  He was very tough to get.  All right.  You'll get your gloves signed.  Yeah, no, I know.  I actually really want to interview him, though.  All right.  It's Jim's.  It's just that Jim's.  All his autographing it for years had bugged me, and he knows that.  But I got a good one with Snoop yesterday.  My Snoop picture signed.  Ah.  Exactly.  Every idiot in the world has a Snoop picture signed.  No, they don't.  You don't.  No.  Almost every idiot. 
[02:22:00]  But I've just always hated it ever since he used my reputation with Ellen Barkin and  Gabriel Byrne to get his pictures.  Ellen Barkin.  She's not meeting with her family.  They were in the middle of, like, a horrible divorce.  They're finally together with, like, eight kids' attention.  You can feel it at the table.  Oh, shit.  This idiot has to walk up.  I walk up and see my friend, Gabriel Byrne.  And then I am introduced to Ellen Barkin, and then this jabroni goes over, and she goes,  I really don't want to do it right now.  You know, I'm with my kids.  Oh.  And he goes, I'm friends with Colin.  We're the ones that always talk about your movie. 
[02:22:30]  And she's like, okay, I guess I'll.  Oh, no.  You didn't beg like that.  You bet I did.  No, I wasn't begging.  It was like extortion.  It was just like, yeah, using my questionable reputation.  Exactly.  Your moderately fucking good name, which, here's the beauty of it.  I got the picture, and she forgot about it five seconds later.  So now I have an Ellen Barkin picture.  Yeah, that's true.  But in the back of her mind, she'll always hate my guts, and she won't remember why.  Right, yeah.  There'll always be something.  There'll always be something there.  You just left a bad taste in her mouth for no reason. 
[02:23:00]  She'll be like, oh, that's that Colin Quinn.  But I did get you and Bob De Niro back together, did I not?  Fucking, you're welcome, motherfucker.  I was talking.  You tried to woo me with Bobby.  When Bobby D was at the Comedy Cellar, and he watched my set, and I hear him laughing.  Whatever, what's he going to do?  Of course he's laughing.  Killing.  And his wife, Grace, we were talking upstairs after, and I didn't ask for a photo, just  because, again, he was there to possibly watch comedians to maybe play. 
[02:23:30]  I'm like, even I knew it was the wrong time to ask him.  I just didn't want to bother him there.  It's true.  Even he knew, but he could tell me he was chomping at the bit.  I wanted to.  He was chomping at the bit.  And he probably would have, but I didn't want him to be uncomfortable and not come back  to the Comedy Cellar.  So I didn't want to, to me, that was the bigger picture.  So I said to his wife, his wife, thank you, Colin.  High road.  Good point.  That's what I was looking for when I said bigger picture.  I said the high road.  The high road, yeah.  Two professionals.  Were you smoking pot on the road, all of a sudden you're high? 
[02:24:00]  All of a sudden you're high.  He's saying hello to the road.  High road.  I like that he's got the PG version and the R-rated version.  Yeah, yeah.  For that high road joke.  So I say to Grace, I'm like, I'm just talking about Colin bombing at De Niro's birthday party.  And she's like, oh, yeah.  She said that was like a fun night.  That was a weird night or something.  But we chatted about it for a minute.  I just told her how happy it made me.  And she laughed because my friend bombed at his party. 
[02:24:30]  But then he got to talk to Bob afterwards and the whole thing got squashed.  I don't feel like it got squashed.  I feel like you brought up a painful memory because I thought I noticed in her face and Bob's  face like a pained look like they're like, oh, down, like the same look Ellen Barkin's  going to have when she's like, well, you think they wouldn't have remembered it anyway by  seeing you when you when you fucking walked in?  How did you did you get a picture finally?  No.  Why?  No, he took the high road.  That was a while ago.  The high road.  Right.  I met De Niro twice.  First time he turned me down that time.  I didn't ask.  I'll get him again.  Why wouldn't you ask that time, though? 
[02:25:00]  Because the comedy is possibly going to play.  He's investigating playing a comic.  I don't know if he's going to.  And Jeff Ross.  Rupert Pupkin.  Exactly.  Jeff Ross brought him in and he watched the show in the back.  Hit me.  Don't you want to graduate?  And the last thing you want to do is take a picture with the guy and make him feel like,  oh, it's going to be this and then have him go to another comedy club and not the cellar.  I didn't want to do that to the cellar or to Jeff who brought him in.  And Jeff was cool.  Jeff brought him over me over after my set.  He goes, you know, Janice, Robert De Niro.  And we shook hands.  He's like, oh, you're very funny.  So it's like I didn't want to be a dick and wreck it for Jeff because he was cool. 
[02:25:30]  But my sister did wind up growing up to be a fine man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's not even.  I was there before it was.  It was a joke.  I'm from New Jersey.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm from where?  Which at that time wasn't a crime.  You grow up and they ship you out to New Jersey.  And his best, by the way, his best comic moment is not as Rupert Pupkin.  It's as La Mata.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When he goes, if he's a degenerate, when he trips over degenerate, it's the greatest fucking 
[02:26:00]  comedian's flub ever.  It is.  And I love how he handled the hecklers.  Yeah.  Oh.  Fuck you.  And then he breathes.  Fuck you.  And the horse you came in on.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And the whole, he just keeps tagging a bomb.  That is great.  It's amazing.  And the horse you rode in on.  I like that he keeps pushing the payoff to the judge's joke and he just snows a drink.  Oh, God.  He goes, oh, yeah, another drink here.  Something happened.  Something happened.  Carlo.  I think that was, he reminded me of, like, that's probably every owner of my father's 
[02:26:30]  place.  Channel 80.  All those shitty places we just talked about.  Frank Cariola.  Don't forget the Bordy Board.  Yeah, here's something happened.  Another drink here.  Something happened.  But the Bordy Board was the funniest place because here's the nice Hamptons.  You're coming back from a nice trip to the Hamptons.  Yeah.  And you'd have to pass because traffic was stopped.  And every Sunday, I mean, I went there a few times.  There'd be a brutal, bloody ball on a Sunday afternoon, like 3.30 in the afternoon.  A beautiful Sunday summer day. 
[02:27:00]  And people just punching the shit out of each other.  And it's like everybody's, oh, in the call, like, watching every week for, like, 12 years.  And nobody said a word about it.  Same spot, too, right at the diner, right?  Yes.  You've got to make the turn.  Right.  Yeah, what the fuck are they fighting about?  I don't know.  They loved it.  And my brother wants you to mention Marrakesh because he used to bar.  Oh, yeah, Marrakesh in West Hampton.  I went there a couple times.  So there you go.  He's listening right now.  Where's Norm?  Norm finished up with Howard.  He should be here any second.  He's arriving shortly.  We're out of schedule today.  Let's go.  That's fine.  I'll say this, though. 
[02:27:30]  If anybody wants to know, the Antisocial Network will be in Washington, D.C., Las Vegas,  and the Chicago Comedy Festival opening night.  Just go to antisocialcomedy.com for details and tickets.  They're all going on sale, I think, Saturday.  I like that he said that like it was a political statement.  I want to say, I'll say this.  I'll say this.  Let me submit this to you, gentlemen.  The Antisocial Comedy Network.  Perfectly clear.  Yes, but it's important to plug.  You know how it is.  Of course.  Got to get the folks in the seat.  Kenny, update.  I'm going to go to Vegas.  Uh-oh.  We have an update. 
[02:28:00]  What's the problem?  Hi, Kenny.  There's going to be a top-secret password coming out soon to get pre-sale tickets.  For the antisocial?  Yeah.  Did you come up with it?  Because I'm going to guess blithering.  Wrong.  It's idiots.  It's easier to spell.  Yeah, it should be tall, dumb guy.  It's not loud at all.  It's not loud at all.  Chip Chippitino.  You're so funny, Chip.  Thanks, Chip. 
[02:28:30]  Could you do his cousin from Italy, Chip Chippitino?  Get over here.  We're going to have our pizzas.  It's not like that.  I got a big boot for a country.  I'll kick you right in the butt.  Oh, because it's shaped that way.  I know.  Oh, sorry, Chip.  That's a mess.  That's the beginning.  It's working blue.  Norm's going to sit over there.  Take your fucking sandwich away.  What is Norm supposed to do?  Start eating sandwiches over here?  I'd be crazy, Chip.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Your hat? 
[02:29:00]  Thugging computers?  Chip's a very literal guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He can just look at something and he sees funny.  But I just like the anger in his eyes when he talks about his mother.  Like you said, he loves his mother, but his anger in his eyes.  I do love her.  She's a saint on her tongue.  It's all angry face.  Her friends of color would always help her fix the rug.  What was always wrong with the rug?  I don't know, but she'd always be laying there and it'd be laying right next to her on top  of a sometimes fix in a rug.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  I've seen that where they got to move back and forth to get the rug back into the corner.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Turn that one.  We're going to move into Brock Lesnar time.  This is going to be a little...  What happened?  What would happen?  What's going to happen, Jimmy?  What would happen if Brock Lesnar comes in here when Norm Macdonald is still here?  Is that a problem?  No, not at all.  Norm just moves over and Brock sits.  That would be a problem.  No, it wouldn't be.  That would be a fight.  No, it wouldn't be.  Hey, who's the big guy? 
[02:30:00]  Hi, Brock.  How are you?  Well, Norm will know he's being on a sports show.  Hi, Norm.  How are you?  Want to act it out?  Yeah.  All right, Norm.  Brock's here.  What night's that show on?  Take care.  Get home safe.  What?  What?  Come in.  Yeah.  Where is he?  You finna out.  Hey, I know it was a short one, but, you know, tardiness.  Not our fault.  You decided to be late.  Hey, take care.  Godspeed.  Good luck with the program.  Jim's got his program with his little questions for Brock lined up. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Listen, I have to get to each one of these.  Jimmy's right.  Jimmy, this is what Jimmy's really thinking, by the way.  He wants the Norm thing to be nice and short.  I like Norm.  I think Norm is great.  I know him.  I'm not wrong.  Yeah, but he's late.  That's not our fault.  It's fine.  He's late.  It'll all work out.  It's all going to work out, guys.  Yeah.  Oh, in the end.  Why don't we plug the big HBO thing, Colin?  Before we say goodbye to you.  Oh, shit.  Because we need the seat.  Jesus Christ.  I don't want to call it.  Hey, Colin.  I got a good one.  Tell us how you really feel.  Oh, God. 
[02:31:00]  That's a good one.  He's been saying that all the time.  This Colin Quinn made it to HBO, and we're happy.  Made it back to HBO.  We'll have to break character.  We're very happy for Colin Quinn.  Last time I was at HBO, I had a mullet.  1992.  Damn, I saw that one.  Yeah.  Great.  Very cool.  Pirate jacket.  Yeah.  Long story short, premieres on HBO Saturday.  A week from Saturday.  Yeah.  April 9th at 10 p.m.  Saturday.  Saturday.  And then you're taking the show to the Hamptons.  I'm going to do it in the Hamptons for a couple of weeks.  Yeah.  East Hampton.  It'll be in East Hampton, but maybe, you know. 
[02:31:30]  For the rich people.  So now you're going to have to stay out there, though, for like a couple of weeks?  A few weeks, yeah.  That's like, I mean, I understand there's a nightlife type thing going on out there.  I'll tell you, it could do a lot worse.  Ma-ha!  What do you mean?  That's like what?  I don't know.  It's a pain in the ass.  You seem like a city guy, you know?  Well, then why don't you fucking invite me to one of your stupid parties once in a while?  Open invite.  Open invite.  Which means don't show up.  He doesn't invite anybody.  He doesn't invite anybody.  He really doesn't.  I invite through Twitter.  Open invite.  I say, if you've ever been to my house and have not stolen anything, you are cordially 
[02:32:00]  invited to this.  Did you get any of those Ava Braun pictures?  You see those new Ava Braun pictures?  Yes.  No.  You see those?  Yeah, it's like the new Ava Braun pictures with Hitler.  Oh, good.  They're hanging out.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  It's those tender moments.  What are they doing?  Booing a synagogue?  It's those tender, sentimental moments that you don't see in most of the...  They're tender.  When have you guys got to have Dice on again?  Tender.  Look at the fury.  He's just sitting there going, I'm getting some food.  I'm ordering. 
[02:32:30]  I'm at the restaurant.  Give me something that a Jew didn't touch.  Okay?  That's what he's doing.  Dice.  Dice is a great.  Dice Hitler, huh?  Yeah, Andrew Dice Hitler.  Yeah, give me some, I don't know, some Wiener schnitzel or something German.  Something pure and Aryan.  Look, I hate to make requests, but can you at least do Dice Kelly before I leave?  Oh, wait.  Wait, wait.  Dude! 
[02:33:00]  Dude, I broke my knee, dude.  Hold my hand.  Hey, hold my fucking hand, you cocksucker.  That looks delicious.  Look at Hitler.  Oh my God, look at Hitler.  Hitler with a little kid.  That's a tender little moment.  He has no mustache.  That is a tender...  You're right, no mustache.  Look at Ava's got a fucking...  That's pussy bulge.  Yeah, she's got a big pussy toe.  Jesus, don't know he liked her.  She's got a camel toe, big tits.  Go back to...  Let me see...  Heinrich Hoffman.  Heinrich Hoffman.  Shop there. 
[02:33:30]  Her awful hair.  Yeah, she had a little short-haired, a little...  Every girl had their hair like Miss Crabtree back then.  That's right.  Hair rascals.  Terrible.  There's Hitler, I guess Ava.  What was that?  Just sitting around the table.  You could always sense Miss Crabtree was like...  Had to like blow Harry Cohn to get that fucking jaw off.  She's like...  Everybody's like ideal teacher.  She's fucking jerking off Hal Roach.  Who's that?  Is that Ava?  Probably.  Look at those gams.  Nice gams.  Yeah.  Oh my God, it's a cabaret. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, they're doing like a cabaret thing to cover Life magazine.  There's some young Nazis.  Yeah.  Young little Nazi children.  That's cute.  Oh, look at the portrait.  Hey, that's my room.  How did they get that?  Right above her dresser.  Yeah.  Is Norm coming down the hall?  Yeah, he's coming down.  All right, good.  Ah.  Yeah, those are some pictures.  I'll stay right on the side.  I want to take a seat.  No, stay right there.  What's wrong with you?  You're a big...  No, he's a friend of yours.  Get in front of the Ava Braun pictures.  Don't move.  No.  Sit there.  Bad feng shui.  Jesus. 
[02:34:30]  It's been a feng shui.  All right.  Ah, well, grab a mic.  You never know when you want to perk up.  I should take my welcome Brock sign off this right now.  Oh, yes.  You move the welcome Brock.  Welcome Brock.  He's got it reserved for B. Lesnar on the chair.  Yeah, hey, no, we're, uh...  Yeah, he was on Stern, I guess, so it takes a little while.  Walk from that end of the building all the way to this one.  It's like an airport.  You've got to take those moving sidewalk-y things. 
[02:35:00]  It's a very long walk.  That's what I'm trying to let everybody know.  It's a train.  It's very...  What is he promoting?  Leave the pictures of Ava Braun just to see what he says.  Norm's Sports Show will be premiering Tuesday, April 12th, 1030 on Comedy Central.  I hear he used to like to gamble.  We should ask him about that.  I'll talk to him about that because I still like, you know, placing a little bet or two.  You don't do sports gambling, though, do you?  No.  Remember you guys I used to see all the time about OTB when it was open?  OTB.  Well, that was you going into OTB. 
[02:35:30]  You just happened to see us there.  No, I remember I'd see you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when we sealed the relationship.  Did you like betting on the ponies?  I did, but now what are you going to do?  Get an online account.  Maybe I'll go to...  Yeah, I know, but it's...  I like the whole idea of going to the old OTB.  It was more like a New York moment.  Yeah, just stunk in there.  Everybody's in there.  Tickets, all the old guys there, smacking their fucking...  Smacking their programs in their hand.  Come on!  Come on!  And it was the most multicultural place before anything was multicultural.  Where people are just getting along. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  Blacks, Asians, white guys, all impoverished trying to get pulled out of that hole.  Are you guys talking about Lisa Lepp and Ali's vagina?  What is this, a roast?  I just had to.  Couldn't think of who else fucked black guys.  A roast you're not invited to?  Why would I be?  You know, it's the situation, and Snoop should do the roast.  You should do a Chip Chippinson roast.  Yeah.  You should do one.  Wow, showed us.  Yeah.  Sure did.  What is this?  Sam keeps coming up there.  What is he, stopped?  Now what happened?  Taking pictures?  He was stopped in the lobby for a moment, but he's literally walking up right now. 
[02:36:30]  What do you mean, stopped in the lobby?  For what?  For what?  What's more important?  They got me waiting in the lobby!  Doesn't this make you feel bad that we're eagerly awaiting, and we made you sit in the  office for 20 fucking minutes while we discussed shirt folding?  I don't like eagerly awaiting anybody.  Not at all.  Unless it's Ozzy.  I don't know why.  It probably should.  It probably should.  You know you're better than this.  When you're a friend of the show, you just go in, boom, sometimes you wait a couple  hours. 
[02:37:00]  So what, dude?  You know what?  It's family.  Sometimes you go to see your cousins, right, dude?  You got to sit in the living room for a little while.  Big deal.  Dude, I consider myself a guest here.  You know, and when you're invited, you don't make your own rules, dude.  This is not my home, dude.  Uh-oh, another update.  Norm MacDonald is in the restroom.  What the fuck?  I gotta take a pee, too, man.  I'm going to pee right now.  Are you gonna go see him?  Let's go pee.  You're gonna go see his dick?  Keep the cell on.  Oh, God. 
[02:37:30]  Don't fuck with my stuff, Colin.  I ain't gonna touch nothing.  What are you gonna do?  I'm just going to the bathroom.  What do you think?  Is he shitting?  This is gonna take him forever.  I mean, it's not gonna take him forever.  He's gonna be...  He's gonna be...  He's gonna be...  He's gonna be...  You're gonna see him walking on the way back.  We'll walk together.  You think Norm's...  I don't think Norm's a hand washer after he pees kind of guy.  He just doesn't come across like that.  Would you lock the door?  You lock him out?  Yeah, lock him out.  It's probably the right move.  What does Colin's day entail after this? 
[02:38:00]  Maybe I'll go to breakfast.  Me and Adrian will go to breakfast.  Adrian, do you want me to go to breakfast?  So you do.  And why...  Not that it's bad, but Adrian shows up with you every time.  Yeah.  For a long time now.  And she's wanted to talk to you.  What is she compiling?  No, I wanted to...  I think we traded numbers, didn't we?  We exchanged numbers.  Yeah, I know she's wanted to talk to me.  Absolutely.  She's been writing about comedy.  She's a serious writer.  She wrote this book called Random Family.  Which is like this brilliant book that won all these awards.  And it's a pretty popular book, too. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, it wasn't just an award winner.  It was also like, you know...  Like a real good book.  Great book.  It's all about the Puerto Ricans in the Bronx.  Puerto Rican women in the Bronx in the 80s.  So she followed...  She takes people seriously.  So she follows...  So she took comedy seriously.  Even though every dumb comedian after two years is like,  Why is she still writing?  No, they're waiting for like a shitty article online.  And she's actually taking it like a real artist.  An in-depth book.  Kind of a thing.  Now, just...  Without just glossing over a comedian and his material,  what more are you trying to get in? 
[02:39:00]  Like, what?  The mind of a comic?  And what makes them like that?  Well, we're done with you.  There he is.  Norm!  Did you get my fucking text about your show?  No.  I love it.  We're on the air.  It's okay.  Yeah, of course.  It's good.  They're greeting each other.  Oh, hey.  Norm MacDonald.  Anthony.  What's up, boys?  Have a good one.  I see you.  Come on.  It's in your kids.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's awesome.  I do my YouTube videos and stuff.  Yeah, it's awesome.  It's fun.  You know, you fuck off a little bit here and there. 
[02:39:30]  Kevin Farley.  Kevin Farley.  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Take a seat.  I think we're kind of running out of seats.  Take the couch right there.  There's a special, too, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Saw the special the other night.  We're not on the fucking radio.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do that.  You can say fucking, fucking.  That's how we roll.  We're on the radio right now?  We just bring it in and let it roll.  That's how that works.  I know.  You're looking at the picture.  Colin's looking at a picture of Hitler.  That's my room.  I'm looking for different motifs. 
[02:40:00]  That's your screensaver?  That's my screensaver.  I didn't put it on my cans, man.  You know Jim Norton?  Yeah, well, you saw Jim.  Jimmy Norton, man.  You can see it.  See, we like bringing everybody in at different times.  The host of the show, the guests.  This is fun.  I saw you guys on YouTube, you know?  I saw you and Jim and you.  Yeah, yeah.  It was awesome.  On YouTube.  It's fun on the YouTube.  Yeah, you never watch fucking YouTube?  What the fuck?  Yeah, you watch the TV.  This fucking guy.  I know.  TV's no shit.  TV's like extinct now. 
[02:40:30]  TV's for the old fuckers.  I watch the YouTube fucking face, all that shit.  Yes.  What about this new thing?  What's that?  No, it's called Colors.  Have you heard about it?  Oh, we were just talking about that.  Hey, I'm a fan of Colors.  We were just talking about that.  Isn't that fucking weird?  No, but it's only 150 yards.  Yeah.  People within 150 yards.  Yeah.  You got it yet?  I don't know.  It seems a little fucking weird.  It is weird.  Like a guy in your apartment building can see what you're doing depending on where he is.  Yeah.  Maybe you could figure out where a lady was looking at the layout of her apartment. 
[02:41:00]  And then maybe, I don't know.  I think it'll come in handy for football players on the field because it's 150 yards, so he  pretty much covers the field and they could probably figure out what the other team's  going to do based on what they're doing with their color.  You don't watch a lot of football, right?  No, none at all.  150 yards.  Well, you know, you've got to consider the end zone.  Canadian football.  I was considering the end zones.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  You know, the entire field.  You're still off, though, a little bit. 
[02:41:30]  Why?  How long are the end zones?  10, right?  It's got to be longer than 10.  No, it's not.  It's got to clear.  In Canadian football?  No, no, no.  No real football.  You got the 100 yards and then how wide is the end zone?  It seems about 10, right?  Yeah.  Let's go with a 10.  That's it?  So you were off by 30 yards.  30.  What about after there, but behind the end zone to the wall?  All right.  Now you're talking 150 yards.  What if they jump in the stands?  Yeah.  I've seen that happen.  Give me a break.  Hold on.  I've got to get this up.  So, Norm, you were on Saturday Night Live. 
[02:42:00]  What a professional.  Yeah.  I'm telling Colin show, right?  I know.  Colin took your gig.  He took my gig?  He took my apartment?  Did he take the apartment, too?  Yeah.  I moved in the same building as Norm.  No way.  No, you really are a fuck.  Single white female.  No, there was one moment.  Colin probably doesn't remember it.  But I was walking to the elevator, and he was coming off the elevator.  Do you remember that?  Wouldn't it happen all the time?  No, I know.  There's a little more detail.  That time you took the elevator.  This was after I had left, and you had come on, and it was like, I don't know, it was poignant 
[02:42:30]  to me.  Oh, sort of a changing of position.  You went to shake Norm's hand, and he spit in your face.  Do you remember that time?  No.  No, Colin was awesome, though.  You didn't have any animosity towards Colin after that.  Not towards Colin.  No, I love Colin.  I heard you were taken off of that show because of the OJ situation.  I don't know.  I don't think it was really bad.  You don't think that was it?  No, I don't really think it was bad.  Because you gave OJ a little guff, and most people were just treating him like a saint. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, but I don't know.  I know people said that and shit.  But you know what I think it was?  It's because I didn't get laughs all the time and shit.  And like, Ole Meyer was watching Leno, who would get laughs wall to wall every fucking night.  Yeah, but that isn't what it was about.  I know, but I can understand his point.  I kind of liked the delivery and the fucking very dry wit of that whole thing.  Well, the problem is, if one guy don't like you and he owns the cameras, you're fucked.  Yeah, but I think it was also that Ole Meyer, when he actually would say something about like OJ,  like, you know, if you get pissed, then Norm would just say, all right, fuck him, and do like five more. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, okay.  Other people would go like, hey, okay, I'll keep my gig.  Yeah, we didn't listen to anybody.  And also, I don't think also we were listening to people within Saturday Night Live, which was probably a mistake, too.  You know, because Jim was, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  How about my impression of Jim that everybody hates?  Yeah.  I hate it, too.  How could they hate that?  It's great.  It's right on the money.  I don't even know who it is.  It sounds like him.  It's perfect. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, man, who got a comedy award?  Anybody here?  Damn, I think one person did.  Huh?  Who?  You?  Did you get one?  I'm saying the comedy awards.  No, the comedy awards.  You don't know about the comedy awards?  It was a big event the other night.  Big event.  Well, I wasn't there.  The Lifetime Achievement Award.  Tina Fey, I think.  No, Eddie.  Eddie Murphy.  Well, that.  No, what did Tina get?  The Mark Twain Award.  Why do you get that one?  You have to be as good as Mark Twain.  That's like, that's a dumb fucking award name. 
[02:44:30]  I was nominated for one, but I didn't get anything.  You didn't get Mark Twain?  No.  You were nominated for anything.  I was nominated for special?  Shout out of most consecutive roasts.  I was nominated for the fucking network.  Yeah, he doesn't like that network very much.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I did edge him out.  You were shout out of fucking roasts without me.  Why are you screaming at me?  We both hate the same people.  It's not each other.  Remember the time you were getting in the elevator after that award show?  Colin, fucking.  Yeah, why don't you do roasts, man? 
[02:45:00]  That roast you did already was fucking awesome.  Because they don't fucking bring me on as roasts.  Why?  I don't know.  They shouldn't be very funny.  They don't bring Jimmy on either.  They always want the new people.  Oh, hey, guess what?  There's a young girl that's middling attractive that swears a lot.  Let's get her.  Is that the new fucking thing?  Yeah.  Sarah Silverman is hysterical.  Right.  Who's funnier than her?  Nobody.  No, except dudes.  Nobody.  But I think she's fun. 
[02:45:30]  These other ladies, they forget that she's funny.  And they think the whole point is just to be attractive and then talk about sucking cock.  You've got to show a lot of leg.  You've got to show a lot of leg with little skirts on.  And then, yeah, talk about sucking cock and manipulating balls with your hand.  And it's hysterical.  Bring back Phyllis Diller.  Some ugly old bag.  Like Rosemarie.  Rosemarie.  Those were the funny ladies.  Wow. 
[02:46:00]  Whoa, that is old.  The funny ladies always used to be ugly old bags.  Yeah.  Or Roseanne.  You know what I mean?  No one was funny.  When they would have a comedian on like What's My Line or something like that.  A comedian.  Comedian.  They never called comedians.  Now a chick can be called a comedian.  But it was always a very funny.  Whenever I'm at a club and I hear, let's give it up for a very funny comedian.  I'm like, oh, it's time to take a piss.  Time to take a fucking piss.  I tell you, man.  You guys got to get this tape.  I don't know if I ever show you this tape.  But, you know, everybody thinks they're edgy and all this shit. 
[02:46:30]  I got a fucking tape.  A CD of LaWanda Page.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Ann Esther.  Ann Esther.  This was from the fucking 50s or 40s or some shit.  And she's in Harlem doing the filthiest stuff.  Like, really fucking funny.  You can't even believe it.  You can almost imagine.  I washed my ass.  You can almost imagine because, yeah, Red Fox and her.  Peanut butter pussy.  Obviously.  What was that joke?  I'm sorry, son.  What was the joke?  Peanut butter pussy? 
[02:47:00]  What the hell?  Easy to spread.  Something like that.  Easy to spread.  Who is LaWanda Page?  LaWanda Page.  Ann Esther.  Fucking funny as shit.  Yeah.  I like Red Fox and he told her he was going to slam her face into cookie dough and make gorilla  cookies.  You can't say that anymore.  I saw one time he had a joke.  He said, man, I take one of those.  He goes, I saw this lady.  She's taking...  Fuck.  It's all right.  You got the voice right.  I can't remember. 
[02:47:30]  He goes, this lady, she's taking the male hormones.  And, uh, oh my God, she had, uh, she's an ugly lady.  She had, she had a hair all the way from her neck, all the way down to her dick.  That's not a good impression.  I don't know.  That works.  The joke's there.  Yeah.  You're fucking, uh, special.  I watched it the other night.  It's hilarious.  It's fucking great.  It's so good to see you back on, uh, TV like that.  Yes.  It was so fucking good.  And, and, and the thing about you, I don't know what it is with that, that, that voice 
[02:48:00]  of yours.  When I read your tweets, everybody that I talk to also reads them in Norm's voice.  And it makes it that much funnier.  Everybody started, during the Oscars, we all start tweeting our shit during the Oscars,  past Oscars.  And, um, one of my buddies, Travis actually, uh, retweeted and said, you gotta follow Norm  McDonald.  And I'm like, I didn't even know you were on a shit, so I, I started following you.  And they were hilarious.  Like, uh, like, the funny thing, when are you gonna thank the computer? 
[02:48:30]  Every fucking tweet.  When are you gonna thank the computer?  Just shit like that is stuff that no one else was tweeting.  It's out of your mind shit.  I just found out about that tweeter shit.  It's great.  And you got, you got so many followers really quickly and didn't have to pull a Charlie Sheen  with it.  It was just funny shit, man.  It's, but when you go to hit the send, you fuck for a second, you go, wait, like,  cause it's just off the top of your head.  And it's right there.  Yeah.  And, and, and I don't do drugs or alcohols, thankfully. 
[02:49:00]  Cause, you know, I'm sure guys could really fuck up and say bad things.  They have.  They have.  You know, Louis CK has had to delete entire threads of things he's Twittered.  Oh my God.  Oh yeah.  The worst thing is too.  And especially if you have a lot of followers.  Because that's what he does though.  I mean.  Oh yeah.  Sometimes even, I guess like he'll even feel bad about it.  And just go back and delete it.  A lot of times if you tweet something, uh, and you want to delete it, even a second later,  if you have a lot of followers.  They got it.  It's already been, been retweeted and you can't delete theirs.  So, you know, if you've got 10 followers and you write something about, Hey, those Japanese 
[02:49:30]  people, by the way.  And then they can retweet it exponentially.  Yeah.  And then it just goes on and on.  That shit was censorship, man.  He made fun of a nuclear breakdown.  It's, you know, we should be able to talk about anything, man.  It's America.  Norm's tweets, like some of them are not supposed to be funny.  They're like profound, like poetic.  Poetic.  Yeah.  I deleted a lot of that.  Cause I'd read my responses and they'd go, you fucking asshole, you're funny.  I'm like, I don't know.  That's just it.  You can't stop being like, if you're funny and then you got like a serious comment, like 
[02:50:00]  I would, I would tweet some ridiculous shit, but then I'd go like, ah, you know, Obama  gave his speech.  Let me give a little feedback on what I believe Obama.  You racist, fucking conservative, fucking rich motherfucker.  Some people too, fucking think it's serious.  Like I tweeted, I tweeted one that I, I said, uh, my, uh, some, I don't know.  I said like, uh, my father was brutally murdered the last week and it's only now I can look back  and laugh. 
[02:50:30]  These people would fucking answer.  They'd go like, I'm so sorry.  Like, uh, uh, it's closure takes a while now.  So I had to go, no, no, it was a joke.  How does anyone read that and not, especially from you and not think it's kind of a joke.  People are so stupid.  That's something this whole thing has opened up where you're, you're kind of communicating  with people you never would talk to or meet that, that, you know, don't understand what  a sense of humor even is. 
[02:51:00]  So the responses you get sometimes like, just like, Hey, I was like, Hey, you know, God,  uh, it's spring, but I'm looking outside and there's still a little snow on my back table.  At least you're alive.  Motherfucker.  You know, I, that was from a dead guy.  I'm getting tweets from the dead.  I guess he had a loved one pass on, perhaps a father that was brutally murdered a week  ago.  I guess to sum it up, everybody's a critic.  Huh guys?  Your special should have been called the voice of reason. 
[02:51:30]  You're doing a sports show.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Now, uh, I, I guess I didn't know you were that into sports, but then again, I don't  know much about football.  I'm into sports a lot, but not enough to, uh, like now I have to go on fucking like these  sports.  Yeah.  You're going to be like the sports guy.  I don't know that much shit.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like I know, I know a lot about sports, but if you asked me like who won the Superbowl  six years ago, I'd have to really think about it. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Those are those sports guys that just know stats.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I go on, now I have to go on these sports talk shows where they know everything.  And then the fucking phone callers, what do you call them?  Uh, phone callers.  Fat guys in the basement.  They know even more.  So it's like, Hey, what do you think of, uh, some guy you've never heard like, uh, stats  that year?  Or some fucking, uh, yeah, you're like, I know Frank Mahavlich, but I know Frank Mahavlich,  the big M you throw me soft balls. 
[02:52:30]  I have no idea what that's about.  He was a hockey player.  He knows them.  He knows things from the seventies.  So what's going to be the gist of this sports show?  Is it going to be like, uh, yeah, just me doing jokes.  Oh, okay.  About sports.  Yeah.  About sports, but it's going to be accessible to people that don't know nothing about sports  too.  Oh, that's good.  That's me.  It's going to be on.  The guests going to be on.  Yeah.  It's hoping you come on.  Yeah, of course.  Colin, I know everything about sports.  You do know sports. 
[02:53:00]  Tell us when the seventies.  Colin knows sports when like they wore leather helmets.  Yeah.  Those good old days.  What do you know about sports?  Colin, give us some knowledge and ask me anything before 1973.  I know everything, I know everything, but after that, I don't know nothing.  Norm, go ahead, man.  Okay.  This is his audition.  Yeah.  I could be the announcer.  Norm MacDonald.  How many, uh, sports show?  How many, uh, uh, how many, I guess I'd say how many, uh, world series did, uh, Babe Ruth  win? 
[02:53:30]  Five.  He goes, he was making the three thing.  He goes, five.  Yeah.  And it was, it was three.  He won one with the Boston Red Sox.  It was three.  As a pitcher.  He was a pitcher.  Yes.  No, he went two with the Yankees.  I'm talking about like 1968 to 73.  You have five years to 73.  Five fucking years.  You stink at sports.  I'll give you an easy, easy one.  All right.  Who was the quarterback on the Colts against, uh.  Johnny Unitas.  Earl Marle.  Against the Jets in 69. 
[02:54:00]  Johnny Unitas, then Earl Marle.  Who played in the Super Bowl?  Both of them.  Johnny Unitas played like five minutes and Earl Marle played the rest of the game.  That's pretty impressive.  What happened to Johnny Unitas?  He was old.  Tendinitis.  He was five minutes older and they had to take him out?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That's pretty impressive.  That is impressive.  That is impressive.  You can be on the warm show now.  You never saw that again.  That's good.  That's almost a trick question there.  It's like a trick question.  And you gave me a trick answer because I had no fucking clue.  Oh, you didn't know? 
[02:54:30]  No, that's why you said two.  I'm like, oh.  Five minutes, they took him out.  I had no idea because he was old.  Yeah, they brought him in like, you know, symbolically.  Oh, like, hey, he's playing.  Oh, no, they brought him in at the end.  That's what happened.  Oh.  All morals started, but then at the end, they're like, we're losing to the fucking AFC.  And they blessed me and Johnny.  You look good, man.  You haven't gained any weight or nothing.  Oh, thanks.  No, it's cool.  He looks the same.  Because we worked together in Boston.  We did this movie.  Oh, what a blast.  Yeah.  We did Grown Ups.  Oh, Grown Ups. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot you guys were in there.  It's the highest grossing picture of all time.  Yeah.  It did make a lot of fucking money.  It did make a lot of cabbage.  You got any points on that one?  We didn't get any Maseratis.  They gave Maseratis, yeah.  They gave out the Maseratis.  They gave Rob Schneider.  Stanley gave Rob Schneider, Rock, Spade, and Kevin James Maseratis.  Four guys that don't need them.  Me and Norm need Maseratis.  What did you guys get?  iPods.  What did we get?  What did you get?  Nothing.  We got Ugats.  Ugats.  What did you get?  He gave me something.  I said I had a joke. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  I did have a joke.  I said they gave us a weekend.  They gave us a zip car for the weekend.  Nice setup.  You guys work well together.  They're beautiful.  I see the magic.  We walk around Boston every day.  We go shopping for clothes.  We fucking...  Whatever.  Whatever.  This son of a bitch.  Every store we go into is like the nice part of Boys and Boylston Street now.  It's all these nice stores so they know us, you know.  I don't know.  I've never dressed in my life.  I don't know how to dress. 
[02:56:00]  He dressed like a hip-hop kid, like a 60-year-old black kid.  No, I just wear whatever is the loosest thing.  It's comfortable.  Do you not like your body?  That's why I wear loose clothing.  I don't like my body at all.  I don't like anything that shows my body.  My tits or my stomach or the side fat.  No, I hate it.  But you seem to be in shape, Norm.  He's in grand shape.  I'm not in shape at all, no.  That's because he wears loose clothing.  I'll tell you something.  This is weird because I was always fucking skinny, right?  And I go to the doctor and he says, we're going to measure your fat.  I said, no, man, I'm skinny.  I don't need to measure my body fat.  I'll call it Dr. Man.  He checks. 
[02:56:30]  He was Dr. Man.  He checks my body.  He goes, no, you're fat.  He goes, you're both skinny and fat.  You're skinny and fat.  Basically like bones and fat.  Like the muscle.  There's no muscle there.  So not a good combo.  But anyways, he takes me shopping.  I take him shopping.  But every story he goes in, he creates a fucking ruckus.  But like guys like, you go to semi, you know, metrosexual guys.  Metrosexual.  Would you like to go in the back?  Now, don't you think if a person said you look metrosexual, isn't that the same fucking 
[02:57:00]  thing as saying you look gay?  Exactly.  What the fuck's the difference?  That's gay.  But then the guy's like, we're in like these nice stores and the guy's like, hey, why  don't you go in the back and take off your shirt?  What?  I don't like showing my fucking body.  You want me to take my shirt?  Hey, this guy wants me to take my shirt off.  Start screaming.  Everybody that comes in the store is like, yeah, don't ask them to take their shirt off.  You can't just accuse them of trying to sexually hurt.  I actually heard a guy fucking so, when I was young, I was fucking skinny and shit.  And when you're skinny, when you're a boy, people don't talk about that. 
[02:57:30]  They always have little fat girls, have tough, but when you're fucking little or skinny as  a boy and people can beat you up, it fucking sucks.  So you didn't take your shirt off even as a kid?  I would wear, this is how stupid I was, when I was three or four or whatever, I'd wear  five shirts over each other.  Just to look bigger?  I reckon I was full.  Dude, you used to have to, in gym class, I know they used to play like shirts and skins.  Right.  And I hated that, and I was like, please make me a shirt, because I, as a kid, didn't  like fucking taking my shirt off either.  You're probably thin. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, I was a very skinny kid and everything.  And I was like, please, and then when they'd say skins, I'd be like, how can I get out of  this?  And then I'd have to go, oh, I got a stomachache.  There's two kinds of dudes, you know?  Like, there's ones where they can go through a shower and shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In a locker room, naked.  Got 12 years old, fucking showering.  Got a hairy big cock.  Right, right.  And, well, you know, two guys fucking a lady and all that stuff.  I can't do that.  No.  How about, no one played hockey with Gretzky when he was a kid? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Really?  But the finest one was, you've got fucking hot stories, but there used to be a guy on  the Philadelphia Flyers by the name of Dave the Hammer Schultz.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This guy was a fucking enforcer.  He was an animal.  Don't force him, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when I was a little kid, you know, at the fucking, where the Kanadzim played, you  know, at the Forum, I was back at fucking Schultz, you know, the big fucking bad Flyers  and shit, you know?  I couldn't find Bobby Clark, but Schultz was standing outside the bus with a big fur coat 
[02:59:00]  on.  It looked like from Slap Shot or something.  And so I ran up to him.  I was a little kid.  I'm like, hey, man, can I get your autograph, you know?  Are you smoking a cigarette?  He threw the cigarette at me.  Oh, Jesus!  It was so funny!  And then I was traumatized, but then later on I was like, that's way cooler than getting  a lot of...  Yeah, that's a lot of...  Yeah, being burned.  Were you good at hockey, Norm?  I was.  I pulled my tendon.  I pulled my fucking tendon.  You guys are young, man.  Well, not really. 
[02:59:30]  A fellow like me.  Yeah.  Getting up there.  Less...  Listen...  Did you have a shot?  Listen, as Colin Wells knows,  I've seen more sunsets than I'm going to see.  Oh, boy.  No, but I tore my tendon, and this is the first time I've been immobile in my life,  because I still have this crazy competitive fucking thing where I'll play 20-year-old kids  and pick up basketball and get the shit beat out of me, but I still think I'm young.  But this was the first time I was immobile for about three or four months. 
[03:00:00]  If you guys ever get there, it's a fucking portal to the future.  You go, holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I noticed those aches and pains that start coming up that you didn't weren't there before.  Oh, yeah.  And you just kind of...  Now you've got to work through them.  And Louis C.K. talks about it, too, when he goes to the doctor, and it's just like,  oh, that's just, you know...  Oh, that's what it is.  That's never going away.  Ever.  Yeah, exactly.  There's no cure for it.  There's nothing.  You've got to live with it.  And it's like, oh, great.  That's just the beginning of the falling apart sequence to death.  I fucking cardiologist. 
[03:00:30]  68-year-old man.  And he's like, you've got to keep walking.  He goes, at our age...  I go, our age?  Like that.  And then I realized that I think I am in his bracket compared to my kid, you know, who's  18.  I'm not in his fuck.  I'm closer to this 68-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, whatever.  Whatever happens, happens.  I talk about this in my new book, Perspectives.  Perspectives.  That's right.  But you wish you had the...  You know what everybody fucking says? 
[03:01:00]  They're like, hey, man, I don't care.  When I get to be 80, I'll just do heroin.  That's what everybody fucking says.  Right, right, yeah.  But I think when you get to be 80, you're like, oh, you're just scared the whole time.  You're not going to do heroin.  I noticed during your...  I'm just hoping young people don't fucking beat you up.  Imagine you're walking down the street.  Every fucking guy could beat every fucking guy and lady.  Just kick your ass.  Yeah.  And they don't give a fuck about you.  I saw an old guy. 
[03:01:30]  This is another thing.  You ever notice this?  You see a fucking old guy, like 80, fucking looks like a skeleton or some shit, right?  In your stupid head, you don't think you're going to get like that.  No.  I don't know why, but...  You think it's going to be just so, like, long and something might change in science or  something, like, and I've noticed on your special, you do have a lot of bits that are  very funny, but, like, very dark as far as the, um...  Death.  Death and growing old and disease and things like that. 
[03:02:00]  One of the funniest goddamn things you were saying was, you know, your odds of getting  attacked by a terrorist or a million and one, but your heart attacking you.  Yeah.  It's just somebody, your heart attacks you.  The heart's not...  What are the odds of your heart attacking you?  Your heart attacking you.  I thought that was offensive.  It was very offensive.  Well, the people who've had artifacts called, it's a good point.  It's very offensive.  Funny to us.  It's too soon.  It's too soon.  But, like, where is that...  Like, where are you as far as that goes?  Are you authentically petrified of the end or of falling apart? 
[03:02:30]  I mean, I shouldn't think about it as much as I do, but...  You do?  Do you lay there?  I go fucking, uh...  I get a lot of tests on.  Do you?  Yeah, make sure everything's cool.  This happened to me one time, because, like, people say, you're a hypochondriac and shit,  but I'm like, no, fuck, that's not it.  It's like, the only chance you got is early detection.  That's all you got.  And so I used to go to the Mayo Clinic, you know, in Rochester, Minnesota, every year, and 
[03:03:00]  I would have...  This is what I'd do.  Because I don't...  Every...  This is what doctors do.  They'll just fucking...  You go, hey, I got a cough.  That's probably a cold.  Right.  You know what I mean?  They just brush everything off, especially if they know you're a hypochondriac.  That's what they told Jim Henson.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So what I would do is I'd go to the...  This is what happened to me.  I went to the Rochester Mayo Clinic, and I would exaggerate all my symptoms.  So I'd go to the fucking...  I'd go to the stomach guy.  He goes, what do you got?  I go, I'm fucking shitting blood.  I'm coughing up blood. 
[03:03:30]  He goes, holy fuck.  So he'd give me a full thing.  I wanted to make sure I got a full thing.  So every fucking guy, blood was coming out of my nose and ears and asshole and everything.  So anyways, just so I'd get a full, clean bill of health.  So I did, and then that's when I'm most happy is just when I'm walking out of that place.  Now, how long does that last?  It doesn't last long, because obviously...  Something can pop up.  Obviously, two days later, the fucking thing can start.  But then, a fucking six months later, I decided... 
[03:04:00]  I'd never had insurance before, so I decided to get life insurance.  Couldn't get it, right?  So I was like, holy fuck, because sometimes they mix up files and shit.  I said, something...  I must have something wrong with me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  And so I fucking said, why the fuck can't I get...  Nobody will accept me for life insurance.  Anyway, it turns out that the life insurance people are privy to all the doctor's notes.  Oh, so you were saying...  So they got the doctor's notes.  Even though I had a clean bill of health, they go, this guy's shitting blood.  Fucking blood everywhere, you know?  I can insure this motherfucker.  So they said, he must have some unknown disease. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So it took me a long time, and then finally I had to get that fucking Ed McMahon life insurance.  I like those guys.  They're like, hey, man, will nobody fucking give you life insurance on account of you're  fucking old and sick and going to die?  Here, we can give it to you.  A dollar a month.  If you're 65 or older, you could get term life insurance, and then it says it doesn't  kick in for three years, premiums, you know? 
[03:05:00]  Plus, imagine if you're the fucking guy that's asked to do that commercial.  And it's like, and no medical tests.  We won't ask any medical questions.  Imagine you're an actor.  Like, you're fucking like Robert Wagner.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know, that's a tough...  You know...  You're like, hey, man, do you think about death every fucking day like me?  Did you never fucking think of taking care of your family at any point?  Until right now when you're on your deathbed? 
[03:05:30]  Until now.  Holy shit, man.  Yeah, I did notice during the special there were a lot of those things, but you make them  funny.  It's very rare that you could use the word cancer in a bit and actually make it funny.  It was just...  Yeah, no, I'm not like...  That's not what I talk about.  It's not...  That was just a certain period of time when I was...  No, that's what I mean, you know.  Thinking about shit.  Do you...  I noticed because I'm very bad with me being alone with my own... 
[03:06:00]  My own thoughts at night.  A lot of times if I'm just in a quiet room without the TV on, like, I'll just think too  much to go to sleep.  And it could be anything.  It could be like, oh, there's a kind of a program I want to maybe work on tomorrow on  the computer.  Or it could be, hey, I wonder when I'll die.  You know, and that...  So I like having the TV on just for that.  Are you good with your own thoughts just laying there in the quiet?  I'm no good.  No?  I try to...  Because, you know, you try something to get after whatever the fuck you'd use to quiet 
[03:06:30]  your mind, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Whether it's booze or whatever the fuck.  Sure, sure.  Whatever it is.  But I try...  So I try...  Meditation.  Try that, you know.  To me, it worked the opposite.  Like, I'm sitting in a room with people.  They go, just close your eyes.  They go, thoughts will happen.  No fucking kidding.  Erasing hellish thoughts, you know.  And then the guy's like, just let them go.  I'm like, ah.  And then you open your eyes.  You look at some other fuckers right beside you.  Yeah.  And I tried it three times.  I could never get to any place of quiet. 
[03:07:00]  No, I need a lot of distractions.  And I could still operate and work.  Like, I could make myself, you know, go to sleep.  Or if I'm working on a computer or something, I'm good with the TV on or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But I need this constant little distraction.  Because if you're just left alone to your own devices, your thoughts will turn horrid.  I stumped a fucking psychiatrist once.  I said to the guy, because I was fucking gambling all the time, shit, right?  I had a gambling addiction.  I'm over it now, but shit. 
[03:07:30]  But he said...  I bet you're not.  That's a good one.  He almost lost everything.  We haven't met Chip.  Yes, Chip Chipperson is very funny.  But he said, the psychiatrist, he said, you're using gambling, you're fixating on gambling in order to escape your real thoughts.  And I said to him, isn't that why you do everything in life? 
[03:08:00]  And literally, I stumped him.  He had no answer.  He was like, huh?  And then he recovered and tried to make it.  But isn't that why you do everything?  Yes.  So you're not sitting at home...  Just thinking.  Just thinking about what's really going to happen to us.  Where it all ends.  What was your gambling poison there?  What did you...  Sports.  Sports was the worst.  Sports gambling.  Sports was the worst.  You weren't a casino guy?  No, I did everything.  But sports was the one that you think you can pick. 
[03:08:30]  You know what I mean?  You delude yourself into going...  You've sports gambled, aren't you?  I've never sports gambled.  In your life?  Well, maybe once I got that slip and I knew nothing and I filled shit out.  I could have won.  What about you?  A little bit.  Yeah, not like you.  I've heard the Norm stories.  I'm a blackjack guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I play blackjack.  Oh, do I love blackjack.  What was your biggest loss?  Did you talk about it?  Not really, huh?  Yeah.  I don't blame you.  A lot.  It was a lot.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  You're over it, though.  I did a stupid thing one time.  Okay.  He's ready to talk.  This was my big statement.  I threw over at Atlantic City on the boardwalk.  I threw 60,000 into the ocean.  No way.  Yeah, to quit.  That was my thing.  I'm going to quit.  Why did you just quit and keep the 60?  It was supposed to be like I felt like I was in a movie.  Wow. 
[03:09:30]  That was a symbolic kind of a thing.  Was it money or chips?  No, it was money.  It was money?  Holy shit.  I said chips, and he goes, what's that?  Wait, so you threw 60, because you had a moment where you're like, this is cleansing.  This is like, to the ocean I committed.  The same way a drug addict would throw his drugs into the ocean.  How long after it left your hand did you regret it?  I regretted it pretty grand.  See, I would have thrown the fucking dealer into the...  That's how I would get over it.  Those stone-faced idiots.  I'm surprised that people like dealers don't get... 
[03:10:00]  Killed.  Killed.  Yeah.  It really is amazing, because they can piss you off.  I've seen dealers do things where it's like...  Oh, where they're motherfuckers?  In succession, where you're like, all right, look, I'm finally getting good cards.  I'm pulling 20s out here.  And the dealer's consistently showing a dumb 4 or a 3, and that 7, 8 pops up, and here's  the ever-present picture card.  Or any time they're dealing around, and I'm like, okay, king, and now they go around  for the second one, four.  Or...  But whenever you see them showing a picture card, that down card, it's always a face 
[03:10:30]  card or an ace.  Oh, it's every time.  Insurance.  Is that your game?  That's your game?  Yeah, I have yelled...  I've gotten to the point where the guy, my security guy, Keith the cop, had to get a  pillow and bring it down, because I was turning around and punching him in the shoulder so hard  when they would pull this bullshit on me.  And I was yelling where, like, the floor guy would come over and go, hey, Mr. Cooney,  you're going to have to keep it down.  Because I'm just like, God, you motherfucker!  Fuck!  So, the pillow... 
[03:11:00]  Do you know how people recognize you?  Yes, they do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, it's humiliating.  Yeah, yeah.  And I would also use the pillow to bury my face and go, like, you're gonna have a fucking  shit!  And I have to tell the dealer, look, it's not you personally.  It's the cards.  I'm yelling.  You reacted to an ace of diamonds the way most people react to a rape.  Yeah!  Screaming into a pillow.  Well, I fucking had an 11 and I doubled down and you're throwing fucking almost 30 grand  out there and they give you an ace?  I never get an ace! 
[03:11:30]  It's funny when you see a famous guy.  It used to be a guy, a weatherman here in New York named Spencer Christian.  Oh, yeah, I remember Spencer Christian.  ABC, Good Morning America.  I think he also wrote, I think he was a smart guy or some shit.  But anyways, I seen him in the casino at the Trump, you know, and you can spot a compulsive  gambler.  Oh, yeah.  His eyes are, and he's on a bad roll.  It's that kind of roll where you keep leaving the tables and they're like, better luck next  time.  You know, that kind of shit.  And he's just the next table and he's putting money, everything's losing, you know, and 
[03:12:00]  he's just saying.  Anyway, this big fat fucking family from Ohio, they go, there's my brother, man!  Oh, no, you don't want to talk to anybody.  So they're taking a picture and he's like this.  Shut up and deal.  Oh, man.  Oh, exactly.  I hear you.  And the other fucking horrible thing is you'll like lose money.  You'll walk away from a table, a fucking craps table, right?  Down like 35 fucking thousand.  And as you walk away, some motherfucker goes, yeah, it's like two bucks for us.  Yeah.  Hey, no, it's not.  It's not. 
[03:12:30]  It's not.  Norm, can we move you over one seat?  Well, actually, oh, yeah.  Oh, Brock Lesnar is here.  I'm here.  Norm has to go.  Oh, you have to leave?  Norm's a busy man.  Your people are telling us that you have to go.  I mean, if you want to stay, it's up to you.  Can we do a quick, quick break?  You run.  We'll start with them in a few minutes.  I'll talk to Brock.  Go, go, go, go.  You run.  Yeah, I just want to...  Norm and Brock will sit there.  And if you can stay, you can stay.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  I want to get a picture of Norm.  Take your hat.  Do you think I'll...  No, I'll give you a thing out.  Could you snap a picture?  Yeah.  I'll take one with that.  Come sit.  Hey, Brock, come on.  Come on over.  It's just a busy day. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, they snuck in.  Someone show Brock where he is.  Brock's right here.  Oh, he's waiting for the picture.  Okay, all right, all right, all right.  I'm going to meet you guys, man.  Come on, resistance.  All right.  Colin, you're out of here, too.  Come on, buddy.  Come on, buddy.  Colin Quinn, long story short, premieres on HBO a week from Saturday at 10 p.m.  Melinda.  See you soon, Colin.  Hi, Melinda.  That's your ex?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you want to...  I hope not.  There you go, buddy.  Where'd Colin go? 
[03:13:30]  Colin just ran out.  It's a fucking mess.  I love it.  It's a clusterfuck.  Don't be around.  Colin, where are you going?  Where are you going?  We actually are on the air.  Hi, Brock.  How are you?  Yes.  Sorry about that.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for coming in.  You know Norm MacDonald behind you, just so you know the people?  That's Norm.  Colin Quinn and Norm MacDonald.  Yeah.  So.  Are you there?  Yes.  Go somewhere?  Go somewhere.  Hey there, man.  Good.  I'll be back.  I'm just...  I'm just taking a lot of pictures.  All right.  Can they do it outside?  They can do it outside, right? 
[03:14:00]  Can they take the pictures outside?  Oh, my God.  All right.  We're taking pictures.  Brock Lesnar.  Jesus.  You really walked into a clusterfuck.  But we're happy that you're here.  Thanks for coming.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Thanks for doing our show.  It was...  It wasn't easy to get you on the show.  Yeah.  I'm happy to do it.  What time did you get up this morning?  Way too fucking early.  So you said you're texting me that you're coming out.  Can we do this outside?  Can we...  Everybody do this outside, please?  I...  Not to fuck with everybody.  Norm.  Nice to meet you.  I love you, Norm. 
[03:14:30]  Good seeing you, buddy.  I'm happy you're here.  No, I love you very much.  I love you to laugh.  Because he loves Brock Lesnar more.  Because I'm happy Brock is here.  And people are doing a photo session in the fucking booth.  Don't wear it out.  We knew this would be a clusterfuck.  That's all right.  I wanted to ask him about the 50,000 he lost on the home run.  But next time.  Norm MacDonald was great on the show today.  Oh, yes, he was.  Holy shit.  Brock, sorry.  Brock is here.  Sorry, Brock.  All right.  Now we are ready.  Yes.  For Brock Lesnar.  We don't want to start off on the wrong foot. 
[03:15:00]  No, of course not.  Your friend wants to come in.  Are you the other guy who wants to come in?  There goes everybody.  No.  You're good?  I'm good.  Yeah.  Okay, buddy.  All right.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's exhausting.  Yeah.  We knew it would bleed because Norm was late coming from Stern.  Like, we know it's going to bleed in.  I said, I'm late, too.  You're Brock, though.  You can be late.  Doesn't matter.  They say you don't like to do a lot of radio.  They said that you kind of...  Me?  Yeah, yeah.  Have you had bad experiences on it or not?  No, not at all.  Uh-uh.  Who said that?  I don't know, but I better come up with the right answer. 
[03:15:30]  Who do I not want to say the wrong guy?  Get somebody beaten for no reason.  We heard the comments you were making about The Undertaker and stuff.  That was on what show?  Ariel Hawani.  Yeah, we played the audio yesterday.  We played the audio, and it was the first, I think, very candid interview you had about  that situation.  Do you have anything to add to that?  Like, why that happened?  No.  And a lot of people, are you willing to deny that this isn't some kind of work for WrestleMania  because a lot of people are bringing that up on websites?  Yeah, why would I want to promote a show that I'm not even on? 
[03:16:00]  Well, that's just it.  Are you?  See, that's what they say, though.  They're like, oh, yeah.  From here, I'm actually going to Atlanta.  They won't let it go, though.  We played the audio yesterday.  No, no.  No, it's a work, see?  You don't understand.  You know the wrestling fans.  It annoyed me a lot.  It's a real fucking beef he's got with The Undertaker.  You didn't explain, and I guess it's too personal, what was actually said, which is fine.  You know, it boils down.  It's really freaking, I mean, it's just, it's really nothing other than, you know. 
[03:16:30]  It was such an odd thing to happen.  Like, after, that was a huge fight.  I mean, obviously, you were not happy with the results.  No.  You walked out of there, and then to have something like that happen was kind of like, what  the fuck am I looking at here?  Yeah, I was, it was just a weird, it was a weird deal.  I mean, there it was.  I got out of the octagon.  I didn't know where I was.  You know, I knew where I was, but I mean, it was like, and I'm walking out, and I, and  I had heard that he might be there, and, you know, so I wasn't, you know, it was just 
[03:17:00]  one of those weird, you bump into somebody, and it's like, yeah, so you really said that  about me, and, you know, so.  By the way, calling him Mark in that interview was brilliant, because it just, that's the  one thing that really made me laugh in that, it's like, Undertaker, Undertaker, The Undead,  this, that, the other thing, it's like, oh yeah, Mark, and I was just laughing, like,  oh, that fucking, that's a screw turner right there. 
[03:17:30]  Ha ha, Mark!  I just thought it was a shitty timing, it's like, you know, a guy loses a real match,  I mean, it was, it was, it was, you know, the heavyweight championship, and to pull some  shit like that on the way out, it's like, it's not your fucking, it's not your show.  I don't even know why he was there, really.  It's not your show, Elias.  I guess he likes MMA, though, he's been to a few.  Yeah, he does, and, and, and I used to, I used to, you know, hang out, I mean, we're  acquaintances, everybody, you know, I don't keep in touch with anybody from, from there, 
[03:18:00]  you know, it's all, you know, you keep your friends close and your enemies closer in that  business, and so, it just is what it is.  Is it a very backstabbing kind of business?  I think I still got some knives in my head.  Well, there has to be a certain amount, and you brought it up, a certain amount of jealousy  as far as the fact that, look, you're in MMA, you're very popular, I mean, you're one of  the faces of MMA, and a lot of those guys could never do what you do, yet at the drop of a 
[03:18:30]  hat, you could always just go back and do what they do.  Yeah, you know, I mean, here's the beauty of what I've been able to do is because of,  I've been able to pave my way because of who I am, you know, my amateur background and whatnot,  but when you're in that business, the guy that's stroking the pencil is, is in charge.  I'm in charge of my own destiny in this, in this game that I'm doing, and when you're  working for a company like that, you're not. 
[03:19:00]  Is that why you wanted to leave?  Well, I left for a number of different reasons, and, you know, I'm here to promote the ultimate  fighter that is airing tonight.  And also, I got a tell-all book that's coming out May 24th.  So, I go into why I decided to leave the company, and there was some other reasons.  Because MMA is harder.  I mean, it's like, not that wrestling isn't a grind, but MMA, you're really being hit a 
[03:19:30]  lot harder than you're getting hit in wrestling, in the face.  I mean, guys like Shane, first of all, Shane Carwin, how did you survive?  I couldn't believe that you kept kicking him off.  No, I got a head like a horse.  I have other things like a horse.  Ass.  You brushed over one thing.  He's a true athlete, and, you know, MMA is a real sport.  I mean, the wrestling thing is entertainment, so he probably felt the competitive edge, and 
[03:20:00]  you wanted to get into fighting.  Yeah, I mean, it was just, I wasn't built for the road.  I wasn't built for being on the road 300 days a year.  You know, it wasn't for me.  They kill you.  We've had a lot of you, well, I mean, now you've moved on.  A lot of you guys.  No, I meant wrestlers.  We're friends with a lot of the guys, and that's the one thing that comes up a lot.  It's like, the grind will kill you.  Yeah, it's a grind.  So when you were fighting, I got to say, too, because I watched the Kane fight was  really, I was surprised he beat you. 
[03:20:30]  I know you were obviously surprised.  Did he hurt you with an elbow?  There was an elbow.  It looked like he hit you with it.  It was inadvertent.  It didn't look like he meant to do it.  I don't know why I had to explain inadvertent.  Who knows what inadvertent means?  Fucking dope, I am.  Say a word, man.  We inadvertently hired him.  Inadvertent is something you say when you come too fast.  Well, that was inadvertent.  I apologize.  I'll pay for the cleaning.  So did he hit you with an elbow that kind of, it looked like right before he pounced  on you, he hit you with an elbow.  Well, I've reviewed the fight quite a bit, and the thing that we picked up is there was 
[03:21:00]  a scramble that we got into, an exchange, where then he shot in and took me down, and  I was able to get back up to my feet, and there was just a left, I don't know if it's  an uppercut or a hook that catches me right on the button, and that's where I end up spinning,  lose my equilibrium, and then we get into another scramble. 
[03:21:30]  He hits me with a knee, which pretty much takes, puts me on the street that I, on the  clear street.  Oh, did you know when you got hit with the uppercut, does it flash to your mind like,  oh shit, I'm in trouble?  Oh shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know when you're, when you can't, when your mind is telling your body to do something,  it's not reacting, that's a shitty place to be.  And you know he's not in that position.  Yeah, he's not.  So you better just, you're looking for exit stage left to try to get your bearings back. 
[03:22:00]  Damn, man.  When you tapped, when you, I mean, when you first fought Frank Miros, obviously it was  one that you were new, so he got you with something that an experienced guy would get  a newer guy with, I mean.  Yeah, he got me in a fair and square knee bar, but I think I gave that, I gave that fight  to him.  I stepped right in for it, and it was just foolish.  We had known, and I had trained for that, and for me to actually do it.  That's why I was, there was a lot of anger when I, for the rematch, for me, there was 
[03:22:30]  a lot of...  Because you trained just for that situation.  Well, yeah, we did, you know.  And when it happened, you're probably like, what did I do?  You're like, fuck.  It was like, it was like I was in drilling, and I was like stepping in and giving the guy  my leg so I could get out of it, and then I gave it to him.  Oh, shit.  So it was like, you dumb shit.  Brock's funny, man.  Do you dislike me or no?  Because it seems like you hated him.  I don't, I didn't dislike him as a person, nonetheless, I just more disliked him because 
[03:23:00]  he beat me.  Is there that thing, like after a fight, when you get beat, I mean, do you feel differently  about the person, and is it personal or strictly professional?  You know, once you get over the, especially if you win, then it's like, turn the page,  I'm on to the next guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.  But, you know, we forget about that, but now when you lose, for me anyways, those things  haunt me until I can seek revenge.  Now, when you do get a rematch, do you look at what happened when you lost and say, I mean, 
[03:23:30]  obviously you're going to say, I'm not going to let that happen again, but do you train  differently so it doesn't happen again?  Absolutely.  Is there something different in your training?  Yeah, you always want to, you know, capitalize and do the best and be better and fix your  mistakes, obviously.  And mentally, is there anything different when you go into a rematch that you lost that  you're like, oh, fuck, this guy did beat me last time?  Is it harder?  No.  No?  I don't, not for me, it's not. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, I haven't lost a lot in my life.  You know, so, but I mean, the losses that I do, that I have suffered are painful to  me.  You know, I've got a loss in 1999 at the NCAA tournament against a guy by the name of Steven  Neal who plays now for, I think, still plays for the Patriots, but those, that's a loss  that sticks with you for a long time and, you know, prevented me from becoming a NCAA champion  and I had to, you know, of course, the next year I was, but then, you know, Frank Muir 
[03:24:30]  and now Cain Velasquez and so, yeah, those are.  Yeah, why are we talking about him getting his ass kicked?  How about his victories, goddammit?  And also to promote, too, Brock is, he's one of the coaches on The Ultimate Fighter and  Junior Dos Santos is the other coach and the way it works, for those who don't know, is  the two, the coaches, you know, they fight each other at the end and their fight will  be June 11th in Vancouver at Rogers Arena.  Wow.  Every year, I don't need to say it's going to sell out, but that's going to be a massive 
[03:25:00]  fight.  Of course.  And it airs, it premieres tonight, 9 o'clock on Spike.  The show, the show, the show Ultimate Fighter airs tonight at 9 on Spike TV and it's me and  Junior Dos Santos are the coaches.  We're coaching, each got seven individuals.  These guys come, move to Las Vegas for five and a half weeks, no cell phones, no newspapers,  no television.  They're all locked in a house together and the winner takes all.  The winner gets a UFC contract. 
[03:25:30]  Wow, damn.  Was it weird for you having taken the role as a coach and kind of mentoring a younger  fighter?  I was refreshed by doing it.  I think it was, I had experience coaching wrestling throughout my career and so it was  like, it was one of those things where I felt like I had no pressure.  I could go in, these guys wanted, there was the same objective that they wanted to win and  I want to get my title back.  So we were all, we were all there learning.  Do you see some people when, when you go into this and think like, poof, this guy ain't 
[03:26:00]  got a chance in hell?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you do.  Sometimes I look in the mirror and say that.  No, I'm just kidding.  Quit, quit.  Yeah, because I can only imagine there's a few people that are involved in the show that  you're coaching where it's just like, dude, find a trade.  Yeah.  Don't quit your day, Jack.  Can we talk about the health thing?  Because when that hit, everyone was like, holy crap, what's going on with Brock?  People, the rumors, when Dana said that you were out.  Even Dana.  Yeah, I was dead for like a day or two. 
[03:26:30]  Well, Dana, Dana and Joe Rogan both were pretty close with it.  They came on our show like, guys, we can't say much, but this is not good.  Yeah, it wasn't good.  And they were hinting that this is, you know, they were more worried about you living than  ever fighting again.  Yeah, it was a scary deal.  I mean, I got, I was training for the fight against Shane Collin the first time, and I  had to pull the fight because I couldn't train for two weeks.  I was so exhausted.  My stomach had worn my immune system down, and I wasn't aware of it. 
[03:27:00]  Jesus.  And I go on and explain in my book about this whole story as well.  But I, so I pull out on the fight.  I ask my doctor if I can go to Canada where I've got, me and my brother have got some property  and do some hunting.  And I get up there, and next thing I know, I'm in a cold sweat, and I feel like I got  shot in the stomach.  Wow.  And I'm bouncing around from hospital to hospital up there trying to figure out and get the right 
[03:27:30]  health care and the right machines to take pictures of me.  And it was a scary deal.  So this is an illness that a lot of people have, and they're unaware of it, and I can't  really put my finger on the cause of it, and nobody really can.  But I dodged a bullet by not having to have the surgery.  Right.  Because they remove, they want, all the doctors want to remove 12 to 14 inches of my comb. 
[03:28:00]  And that's a career ender.  Well, and shit in a sack for six months.  Oh, really?  Fuck that.  You know?  So I deferred that and just said, I'm going to try to do this on my own and change my diet  up and make it easier for my system to digest food.  You kicked a disease's ass.  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  It is amazing.  My God.  I can't even drop 10 pounds on the elliptical by drinking juice.  And you fucking beat diverticulitis. 
[03:28:30]  Hey, you mentioned your brother in there.  What does he do?  He's a farmer.  He's a farmer?  Yeah, we're farmers.  He doesn't fight or anything like that?  No.  Those days are over.  He'd like to, I think.  Is he a monster like you?  He's a big hoss.  He's a big hoss, yeah.  Pulling a plow.  Yeah.  He's a workhorse.  Were you ever bullied growing up or no?  Were you the guy who was bullied?  Yeah, we were just talking about that on the ride yesterday.  You know, this whole bullying thing pisses me off.  You know, I think it's all right for some, to an extent, for somebody to get bullied builds character a little bit. 
[03:29:00]  Absolutely.  I mean, these, you know, cops or moms and dads that want to run around and protect people.  There's life on the street.  There's nobody.  It's you out there.  Yeah, I think part of social skills growing up is getting a fist in your face every so often or at least getting called names and having to defend yourself.  I think it's so different now, the age of technology and, you know, everybody's just sheltered.  Yeah.  They don't have to communicate.  We communicate via text messaging.  Cyber bullying. 
[03:29:30]  And, you know, I don't know.  Do you tweet?  Do you do any of that shit?  No, I don't.  I don't Facebook.  I don't tweet.  I don't.  Yeah, we learned that about him.  He likes to go in the woods and hunt for him.  Yeah, I just.  You like to get away when you're not in the spotlight, right?  I just don't like.  Why would I want to put my life out for everybody?  I don't like to be contacted.  They say it's hard to get a hold of him.  Yeah.  You've got to go wander around in the woods to find Brock.  Shooting flares up in the air.  I think Joe said that. 
[03:30:00]  I think Joe Rogan said that.  When Dana finally needs Brock, they've got to kind of wander around.  Do you have a cell phone at least?  In the woods.  Sometimes I do.  See, sometimes.  Do you bow hunt or rifle?  Yeah, I bow hunt.  Strictly bow?  No, no.  Yeah?  No, I shoot guns.  You like guns?  I like guns, yeah.  So do I.  Yeah.  You know, one of my biggest sponsors is Federal Premium Ammunition.  Federal ammo?  Yeah, Fusion.  I'm the spokesperson for Fusion Ammunition.  And I just love them.  Rifles?  Do you like pistols, too?  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
[03:30:30]  Guns and NRA all the way.  Me, too.  I was lucky enough to get my New York City carry permit, which is almost impossible to  get.  And I love going to the range.  I'm not a big hunter, especially here in New York.  It's kind of rough to go out on Long Island and shoot a bunny rabbit on some poor Jewish  neighbor's lawn.  But, no, I love target shooting and just challenging yourself.  Me, too.  I do a lot of bench.  Putting that target out further and seeing that.  It's a lot of fun.  Let me ask Brock a question.  Do you have a .50 cal on your kitchen table? 
[03:31:00]  I got a .50 cal in my bedroom.  Oh, in the bedroom.  All right.  Well, at least that's for defense.  He had it on his kitchen table.  I picked up a Barrett, a .50 cal, and going out to Calverton out on East Long Island.  I got a Desert Eagle.  Yeah, I got a Desert Eagle.  I got a McMillan Custom.  How fun is it the first time you shoot that eagle?  You laugh.  Absolutely.  And it's funny.  You just start laughing.  It's like sitting on a tank, but you're not.  It's in your hand.  The howitzer.  That must look like a Walther PPK in your hand, though.  That's a big weapon. 
[03:31:30]  That's a big gun, yeah.  But, you know, all my guns are loaded.  Yeah.  So am I.  No, I mean my guns.  Wait a minute.  It's a drunk joke.  I think, for me, I think it's...  It's a part of your, you know, it's part of our rights here.  It's my life.  It's my life.  I grew up that way, and, you know, we could drive around with the guns in the back window,  and, you know...  Yeah, you come from a place where it was a little easier.  Yeah, back in the day, I brought guns to school.  Yeah.  They were to go hunting.  They were shooting clubs.  I didn't think about shooting anybody. 
[03:32:00]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yep.  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  Now, if you draw a picture of a gun in school, you're off to the fucking shrink, and you're  suspended for a certain amount of time.  I think it...  And I honestly do think it's a healthy thing.  It's challenging.  It's fun, and it doesn't...  I think if you don't grow up around it, or if you're uneducated about it, you're probably  pretty scared.  There's things that I disagree with, and I probably would admit that I'm uneducated about it.  Would you wear a gun?  Let me say this.  Would you wear a gun? 
[03:32:30]  Here we go.  And I'm just concerned, but Anthony, would you wear a gun in the house?  He's armed in his house.  He has...  Well, you know what?  I have a big house.  I've heard of a lot of home invasions in my neighborhood, and I'm not paranoid to think  the door's going to bust open or something, but when my guns are upstairs in the safe,  upstairs locked, it's very hard at a certain point to, if something suddenly does happen,  and I do need to get to one of my guns, to go and get it when I'm cut off from the stairway.  Well, that's the worst.  That's why every gun in my house is loaded all the time. 
[03:33:00]  That's what you've got to do.  An empty gun is useless.  It's useless.  Are we going to throw it at the guy?  Yeah.  You know what?  The Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez, when he was killing these old women, and the woman had  a rifle under the bed, and she pulled it out, and she aimed it at him, click, because  her grandchildren had visited, and the husband had unloaded the gun a few days earlier, and  she didn't realize that, so...  That's not good.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I didn't mean to stop the interview.  I mean, as my kids get older or whatnot, you know, they're aware, but I got really young  children, but as they get older, I'm going to have to be more, you know, way more careful. 
[03:33:30]  And the best thing is, because a lot of parents, I think, try to just shield the kids  from the gun.  And the best thing to do is completely educate them.  Explain it.  My daughter is totally educated.  Yeah.  She shoots guns.  She shoots bows.  You know, I mean, she's totally educated about how they work.  My dad did a great job of educating us growing up.  He showed me the gun when I was a kid.  He said, you fucking touch this thing.  I'm belting you in the fucking face.  It was great. 
[03:34:00]  He was a great dad when it came to you.  Pistol whipped the shit out of you.  He actually did.  He pistol whipped me like fucking Goodfellas.  How old's the daughter there, Brock?  She'll be nine.  Nine, and she's already working the guns.  And his son, he's got a few years before a poor son of a bitch has to knock on your door.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Hey, there's this lovely girl.  I want to take her out.  Let me say, oh, the dad is Brock Lesnar.  Yeah, this is great.  He's going to open the door, and they're just going to go, you know what?  I'm gay, and they leave. 
[03:34:30]  Now, do you have sons, which I think the names are the greatest names.  Turk and Duke are your son's names.  You can't pick more fucking man names than Turk and Duke.  Go for it on that one.  And you just like the names, or were you thinking?  No, I just like the names.  The Duke, you know, he was the man back in the day, you know.  And Turk, I don't even know.  There was a guy in amateur wrestling that had the name Turk, 
[03:35:00]  and the television show with Robert De Niro, his name, the role he played on the show was Turk.  Oh, the movie.  The movie, yeah.  Oh, God, a righteous kill.  A righteous kill.  A righteous kill.  Rooster and Turk.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Tell them how much you love those names.  We didn't love the film.  We didn't appreciate the movie.  We made fun of Pacino's lift.  No, we didn't like the movie.  I was at the premiere, and I didn't get to meet either one of them.  It was humiliating.  I had to sit in front of Erwin Winkler, the producer.  And Pacino's lifts, you can see at the end. 
[03:35:30]  Watch the last scene when he's like, continue with success, and then he dies.  And when the camera pans, you can see Pacino's little lifts, and we've just become obsessed.  The lifts on his shoes.  They're just adorable.  Because he's a little guy.  Little fella.  He's a little guy.  We're running out of time.  Are you going to get a rematch with Velasquez, or what?  Well, I'm going to beat the Santos, and then I will.  Well, we already know that's going to happen.  Is that what happens when the winner of this goes and fights Cain?  Oh, fuck.  That's cool.  He's out.  He had an operation. 
[03:36:00]  I guess whatever happens, nobody comes back.  He fights where he fights.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't pay attention.  I just pay attention to me.  Who am I beating up?  Who hit harder?  Was it Cain or Shane Carlin?  You know, really, that's the stupidest thing that I can hear.  It's not a stupid question.  No, it is.  It's all right.  Because I don't think anybody really hits any harder than anybody else.  It's just a matter of getting hit in the right spot. 
[03:36:30]  Where it is.  And I thought that, too.  How many times in a row it is.  My nephew wanted me to ask.  He's here tonight, and he goes, please ask.  I'm like, bro, I'm not going to like that question.  So, Nicholas, I asked for you.  Oh, he sold you out.  No, but I'm not saying, but it's just like, people that don't get hit are, you know, like,  well, how do you train to get hit?  You don't like getting hit.  You don't want to get hit.  Obviously, yeah.  You don't, you know, nobody, you know, I'm sure some guys hit harder than others, but  I don't have a hit monitor on my face or anything or something like that in that respect. 
[03:37:00]  But all I know is that Shane Carr brought the thunder, and I withstood it and was able  to capitalize, and, you know, Cain Velasquez hit me in the right spots, and he was the  better fighter that night.  I don't fight professionally.  I just want to clarify, because a lot of people see guys like me and Brock, and they just assume.  But I don't, what we do, like, we have a lot of guys, we've interviewed a lot of guys 
[03:37:30]  come in.  And I know you kind of did it on Fallon, but we've been doing it for a while, where  I try to ask him to put me a very...  Well, you want to go to sleep.  No, no, no.  I really don't.  He's gotten very subtle armbars where it's like...  BJ Penn armbarred me, Couture and Cain both, Cain Guillotine choked me, and Fedor did mostly  my arm, and then he choked me, and he really enjoyed it.  Like, if you watch the video, he's like, he didn't smile for the whole interview until he's  choking me.  He is laughing.  And that was technically his last victory.  And so I wanted to know if you would put me in something, but I tap very quickly. 
[03:38:00]  He taps so quickly.  Really quick.  I'll just do something really simple.  Oh, he's grabbing my leg.  Yeah, this is...  Hold on, where do I tap now, Brock?  That's a very important...  Because you...  This is just something really simple.  All right, he's got him around the calf.  Okay, my hand is here.  With his arm.  Okay, he's got my...  I'm around the calf.  He's got my calf, and he's like...  And now he's putting the front on the...  Now, what Brock did was he took my leg.  He's got my leg under his arm.  Yeah, yeah.  And you'd be surprised.  We could do that just one more time, but not for a long time.  The leverage he's got on his shin. 
[03:38:30]  Is there another one?  That's an Achilles lock.  That's an Achilles lock?  Oh, okay.  Oh, good.  This would be a heel hook.  A heel hook.  Oh, that looks...  Wow!  That's not good.  Oh, I don't like the heel hook at all.  Oh!  Wow!  Do you know how you knew that was going to suck?  Because as he's explaining, there's no pressure being applied.  I'm like, I don't like this already.  That's how you would beat me.  If we were fighting and you just went heel hook, I'd go, all right.  I'm fucking finished.  He tapped at the fucking monologue.  Wow.  Oh, damn.  That's great. 
[03:39:00]  Well, I know that we have very limited time with you today.  Yeah, yeah.  This has been great, though, man.  Fantastic.  I appreciate you guys for having me.  I do.  I love that you came in.  Yeah.  I think it's great you're doing this.  It's great for the show.  Because you are...  It's amazing.  You came in and were automatically the biggest name in the UFC.  And your name just evokes a lot of feelings from people.  People love you.  People hate you.  But, I mean, they watch.  So, it starts tonight, 9 o'clock, against Dos Santos and Brock's team on Spike.  And, of course, June 11th in Vancouver, Rogers Arena. 
[03:39:30]  That's going to be huge.  Yes.  They will have...  And then the winner of that fights me.  And I'm going to see what I can do about that heel hook.  Wow.  Try to defend against that.  Dude, that's really an awful feeling.  You don't like that one?  I want to go home and just wake my girlfriend up like that.  Do it while we're fucking.  Nice to hear her.  Put her heel hook.  Yeah.  Finally hear her go, ow.  All right.  So, I guess that's it for today.  Thanks, guys.  Brock.  Great Brock Lesnar.  Thank you, buddy.  Brock, really cool, man.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:40:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Or the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
