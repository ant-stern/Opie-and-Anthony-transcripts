<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties before the hosts abruptly announced their immediate firing from YSP radio in Philadelphia.  They attributed this to declining ratings (which they disputed, citing strong performance in key demographics) and the departure of supportive station personnel, specifically blaming the new program director, John Cook, whom they heavily criticized and accused of dishonesty.  The announcement sparked a flood of angry calls from listeners across various markets, many vowing to boycott YSP.  Opie vehemently declared he’d return to Philadelphia radio for free to spite the station. The hosts explained their return to terrestrial radio from satellite wasn’t financially motivated, but rather a strategic move to reach a broader audience.

The show then veered into a discussion of Rudy Giuliani's surprising declaration of Red Sox fandom, speculating on political motivations or loyalty to Joe Torre. This transitioned into a highly offensive and sexually explicit discussion of Hillary Clinton and her relationship with Bill Clinton.  The hosts returned to the YSP firing, reiterating their anger and frustration with Cook and the low listener numbers reported in Philadelphia, engaging in a humorous exchange with their only remaining Philadelphia caller.

Further segments covered a seemingly underreported shooting by an off-duty police officer; the California wildfires and their handling compared to Hurricane Katrina; and the arrest of child psychologist Dr. James Bonsek for possessing child pornography on his computer. The hosts also found humor in a video of a small Turkish woman using an axe to fend off an armed robber, employing highly offensive and demeaning language in their commentary.  A listener contest was also promoted throughout the broadcast.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about the aforementioned axe-wielding woman, followed by a segment on Halloween candy and unhealthy treats. This included anecdotes about E-Rock's childhood candy habits,  criticism of “healthy” Halloween alternatives promoted in the news,  and humorous exaggerations of parental candy inspection. Dan Gross from the *Philadelphia Inquirer* called in to discuss the YSP situation, corroborating the hosts' frustrations with the station’s lack of communication and transparency. Opie reiterated his willingness to work for free in Philadelphia.

The show included additional off-color jokes, animal rants, a caller's story about his father stealing candy, and jokes about Japanese game shows.  They discussed a news item about a man who married an 82-year-old woman who subsequently died, followed by graphic and darkly humorous speculation. A segment featuring listener-submitted audio clips, curated by Renee, was also included.  Arlie Ermey was slated to call in later.

A segment featured a funny video of an excessively boastful gym-goer, followed by an interview with Arlie Ermey. Ermey discussed the enduring popularity of *Full Metal Jacket*, a car accident during filming, challenges on set, and his involvement in “Take a Vet to School Day.” He also shared anecdotes about his early stand-up comedy career, his work on *Apocalypse Now*, and his revised show, *Trigger Time*.  Ermey used frequent profanity throughout his appearance. Listener calls, further discussion of Ermey’s career, and office banter about Sam’s pranks followed. A show about phobias, featuring a woman with a fear of bubblegum, was also mentioned.

The show concluded with the "Line of the Day" contest, featuring runner-up jokes and a winning joke about a former First Lady and STIs.  The hosts then reacted to an FCC warning about their on-air language, responding with highly vulgar and sexually explicit language and threats (presented comedically).


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and you went, boom, like go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say? 
[00:01:00]  Jodie Foster?  Great.  That's good.  What happened?  Now it just sounds like part of the promo.  What happened?  We're live.  What happened?  What's today's problem?  What happened?  Problem?  Problem.  What happened to our intro?  Any clue? 
[00:01:30]  Are we on the air even?  Yeah, this is, I would say this is on the air.  You think this is on the air?  Who knows?  Screw it.  Where's our, um...  What happened?  Where's our rage?  What happened?  I just want to know if anyone has a clue.  What happened?  Iraq, do you know what happened?  No, it plays from the other studio.  Okay, so why don't we go to the other studio and find out what happened?  Travis, what happened?  Steve's in there now.  Steve's in there.  Ah.  Then what happened?  Fix everything. 
[00:02:00]  What happened?  Then, report?  From the bridge?  The preliminary report is that the computer that plays that just stopped playing it.  Or the file was bad, it just stopped it.  It just, before it was over.  The file was bad.  Bad file.  Bad file.  Hi, welcome.  Boom, boom, boom.  Bad file.  It's a digital world we live in. 
[00:02:30]  We live in a digital world.  Ah.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Right about now, Philly is realizing that they don't have Opie and Anthony anymore.  Oops.  In three, two, one.  And there go the phones. 
[00:03:00]  Dude.  And there go the phones.  How do you want to hear it?  Tom Petty is playing on YSV.  That is so much better than the Opie and Anthony show.  If that doesn't prove that they just don't get it.  It's kind of an insult to us that they think Tom Petty, an old, tired Tom Petty record, is better than the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:30]  This business sucks a big, Harry.  Running down a dream.  Dude, it is running down a dream.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was, you know, let's get to the point.  Let's roll.  Another dimension.  Because you can't say joint.  Yeah, I guess we don't have any listeners.  Ah, the phones are lit.  It's all Philly calls.  What happened?  They're saying, what happened?  And I'm kind of disappointed with the fan sites because those idiots just allowed, like, our enemies to take over the message boards. 
[00:04:00]  You guys are really stupid and got to regroup and wake the F up.  Seriously.  You got to wake the F up.  You got to regroup and wake the F up.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Well, we got to address the Philly thing.  Obviously, I went off on a pretty impressive rant yesterday, I must say.  Well, it got the attention of the GM and the PD, apparently. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, finally.  That was my intention.  And then I did some research and stuff.  And everyone's getting their facts wrong on fan sites and stuff.  Here's the deal.  This is what I learned yesterday.  Because of my rant, they decided they no longer want to continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  But here's the interesting part of that.  They were going to get rid of us within 10 to 14 days.  Oh, really?  So I just sped up the whole process. 
[00:05:00]  Sped it up?  Sped it up.  I speeded it up.  What?  No, just sped it up.  I sped it up.  So they were getting rid of us either way, but they didn't have the balls to tell us in  any form.  They were going to just allow us to continue with the Opie and Anthony show in Philly.  And then one day, we'd come in here and not be on in Philly anymore.  Like today.  Huh?  Like today.  Well, yeah, but at least we found out before we went on the air instead of coming in here  like dopes and going, hey, Philly. 
[00:05:30]  And then someone calls and go, hey, you're not on here today.  So that is the first fact.  The second fact is YSP, as we know it, is dead.  It's been dead for a really long time.  And I almost posted on one of the message boards because one of the guys is like, you  know, Opie said when they first went back to regular radio how YSP gets it and they're  already printing wow stickers and and they got promos and there's an excitement that is  all true at the time when I said that YSP did get it. 
[00:06:00]  They were printing wow stickers.  They were making promos.  They were very excited to have us back in Philly.  But some some things changed since that day and and recently.  And that was getting rid of, you know, Karen Buck, who was like a soldier for this show  down there.  And also they changed PDs.  Yeah.  Once that happened, there was a guy, Gil Edwards.  I can't believe I have to explain this to people, but there was a guy named Gil Edwards  who really got the show as well.  They got rid of him. 
[00:06:30]  The company got rid of him.  They went decide to go into another direction.  They hired this John Cook guy that never believed in us, obviously, but came up here  anyway and lied to our faces that that, you know, that he was very excited about working  with us and and they're going to flip formats and we're going to be a big part of that.  And there was an excitement.  Then we went down, I think, a mere two or three days later.  We broadcast it live for two days, had had a great turnout from the the Philly fans.  And then we did our virus show and we had, I don't know, close to what, 10,000 people 
[00:07:00]  in the venue.  Yeah.  And then sat for close to two hours after the show signing autographs.  We got a huge audience in Philly, but for some reason, because we've been left in the  dark, they don't want this show in Philly anymore.  OK, and you can't really blame ratings.  We we and this is interesting because I'm reading the articles and they're saying that,  you know, our ratings weren't that great.  They kind of were all right.  I mean, men, 18 to 49.  That's why we do the Opie and Anthony show.  That's why we do it.  And we're in fourth place and moving up.  OK, nothing to brag about, but it's not too shabby. 
[00:07:30]  In men, 18 to 34, another real key demo for this radio show, we were in third place.  OK, and I've been doing radio a long time.  And I know what people hate when I say that, but I have and I'm pretty educated.  You don't get rid of a radio show that is fourth, men, 18 to 49 and third, 18 to 34 in  men.  You just don't do it.  You just don't do it.  Just shows how stupid they are down there.  They're absolutely stupid.  Well, they did it.  And it's really frustrating to sit here and take this one because, you know, we just did 
[00:08:00]  an article for FMQB and we were talking about, you know, syndicating a radio show.  And the reality is, you know, you get thrown into a bunch of markets and in some markets  you're going to do great, like like Boston, like Buffalo.  I hear we're doing very well in Syracuse.  And and then in other places, you're just you're just not going to ever find your audience  for whatever reason, like Detroit.  We never found our audience.  Chicago, they kind of messed with our time slot and it never got better after that.  We're on like 5 a.m.  to 8 a.m.  It's a little weird. 
[00:08:30]  We understand we're going to lose Chicago and that doesn't that's fine.  That's fine with us, you know, but losing Philly is so ridiculous and infuriating.  I can't even tell you.  And I told corporate yesterday, I'm like, we have to lose Philly, a very important market  to us because they hired a bunch of dummies down there that don't get it.  That is so frustrating to me.  So frustrating.  Yeah, it is. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, would have liked to have stayed on in Philly, but it didn't work out.  What are you going to do?  Bobby, what's up?  We have our first syndicated market that we were in.  Hey, Bobby, what's going on?  Hey, Bobby, can you hear me?  Yeah.  What's up, Bobby?  I don't get it.  I don't I don't get how how they just they didn't get the show.  It seems like the O&A show is something that Philly can really sink their teeth into as 
[00:09:30]  opposed to these, you know, dopey President Steve.  How do they get that but not get O&A?  I just don't freaking get it.  Well, I mean, we did all right.  I mean, YSP, the fact is the legendary YSP is a very damaged radio station, has been for  a while.  And, you know, it was going to take even more time to get the ratings up.  And unfortunately, we don't get that chance now.  So I mean, the phones are just they're just lit.  John, what's going on? 
[00:10:00]  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, John?  Well, I drive pretty far to work every day, spanning Jersey to Philly.  And I can't believe you guys are off.  Everything in Philly sucks, basically.  All the radio stations.  And I hate the city in general, to be honest.  But well, I don't hate Philly because I don't want this to be an F Philly thing.  I say FYSP, absolutely.  But, you know, I mean, our show really, really caught on in Philly over the years. 
[00:10:30]  You know, we brought our comedy tour down there for a reason.  Those guys really, really are hardcore fans and get the radio show.  So is there any plans like of another station in Philly?  Like, have you talked to anybody else or?  No comment at this time there, sir.  Let's say hi to Justin.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just can't move to Philly.  I came from New York.  And I thought I was going to have the L&A show. 
[00:11:00]  I guess not.  What the hell?  I got to move to XM now?  Yep.  Well, you could get an XM, that's for sure.  But I guess they dump out XM mentions over here.  The guy did yesterday.  He should have.  He admitted he shouldn't have.  Oh, okay.  So they're not dumping out today?  No, why would they?  Well, they dumped out yesterday.  That's why.  All right.  Well, I didn't know that until just now.  Thank you, Justin.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, not much, guys.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  I just want to say, I already hear that you guys are going in Philadelphia. 
[00:11:30]  You know, screw YSP.  I was a long-time listener with Howard and everybody else.  And, you know, I don't like the rock and roll.  So, F-YSP.  I strongly suggest that you don't support that radio station.  Get the word out.  Do not support that effing station.  And it's going to be a lot of...  Jesus.  What?  I don't know.  I just don't think the rest of CBS is going to enjoy hearing that.  Oh, I don't give a crap.  Yeah, I know.  I don't really give a crap anymore.  I understand you don't.  I ain't going to sit back and take this crap. 
[00:12:00]  Absolutely, we can tell our listeners not to support YSP and get the word out.  Don't support YSP.  Mike in Philly, what's up?  Mike, what's up?  You want to get thrown off on every station?  We're not going to get thrown off every station.  Do you want to?  No, I don't want to.  Oh.  I'm just wondering because saying don't support a CBS station, no matter how much you hate  it, gets up to management and management goes, you know something?  We don't need the headache of these idiots. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, we're idiots.  I'm not saying we're idiots.  I'm saying management will say...  We were just treated like crap, dude.  Of course we were.  All right?  But I'm just saying...  We're not idiots.  If you bash...  I'm not bashing CBS.  Did you hear me?  I'm bashing YSP.  They treated us like crap.  They threw us out with the morning garbage.  You will not.  And now I want our fans not to support YSP.  I didn't say one thing about CBS.  I didn't say one thing about the other radio stations. 
[00:13:00]  I just know how management thinks.  Well, then so be it.  Then we just go over to XM and we'll have a little fun.  What can I tell you?  It's almost impossible to sit here and take this crap.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Philly.  Eddie.  I sat through syndication underground.  I sat through the suspension.  I sat and waited.  And you know what?  Now I got to deal with this?  With this?  Are you kidding me? 
[00:13:30]  It's just ridiculous.  I don't care what you guys have to do.  Get back down here because you know what?  You got such a strong fan base down here.  And if they don't get it, you know what?  You're right.  F them.  I'm never going to listen to that station again.  I didn't listen to that station before when Idiot Boy was on.  I'm not going to listen to them now.  I got to wake up on Pearl Jam.  I'm sorry.  If I want to listen to Pearl Jam, I'll listen to my iPod.  Okay?  They know what they're doing.  Pearl Jam is much more important than the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:14:00]  Bob in South Jersey.  What's up?  O&A.  All right.  This is bull.  All right.  Whatever it takes.  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  I listen to O&A all morning long.  I'm going to go through my company, get a petition put together, and get the idiot that  got used gang to fire.  There's enough truck drivers that I deal with every day that I can do it.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Let's go to Rob in Pennsylvania.  We're going to band together the truck drivers. 
[00:14:30]  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I've just been listening on hold on my cell phone since YSP.  It has no action going on except Pearl Jam, Papa Roach.  That's good.  And they did.  I was incorrect.  They did dump out of the reference to satellite radio because just now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll do that.  That's how they operate.  That's how they operate.  Hey, guys.  I'll just keep it alive on 202. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Dan in Syracuse.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good.  Syracuse.  I love you, man.  I filled you in after Howard.  Love you guys.  I just don't know what the heck Billy's thinking about, man.  I'll tell you the truth.  All right.  Not a couple.  I'll tell you.  But you guys go off at 9 o'clock here.  I wish you were on for a full shot, man.  I really do.  Oh, well, thank you, Dan.  I appreciate it.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing today?  Hey, pretty good. 
[00:15:30]  It's a dark day in Philly, man.  It's a dark day.  It's so ridiculous, I can't even tell you.  Usually is.  You guys coming to any other stations around here or not?  We're going to figure that out, sir.  Is there anything going to be on the website?  Check it out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Just keep checking the websites.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I couldn't wait while we were going to listen to that shit.  Oh, sorry.  Listen to that stuff here.  Tom Petty on there.  So I flicked on the X7 in the house on the satellite. 
[00:16:00]  I was really thinking.  They took away every talk show on it that was funny, and they blow you guys.  I gave my X7 to my girlfriend.  I'm stealing it back now from my car.  In fact, I can't deal with this anymore.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Off.  Off.  Oh, well.  That does explain why he wasn't calling back. 
[00:16:30]  Well, it certainly does.  That is kind of revolting.  I won't ever say that guy isn't a douche.  He certainly is.  What do you mean?  What are you going to do?  What the hell are you going to do?  I just hate, you know, you look at the papers and go, oh, okay.  This is how they report it.  This is nice. 
[00:17:00]  Truth of the matter is, we were going to be off in a couple of weeks, but yesterday someone  got their feelings hurt in Philly.  Yeah, it's like nobody tells you anything.  It's like they really don't operate.  I mean, there really is truth to the fact they don't operate like men because they don't  just tell you what's going on.  Nobody ever tells you what's going on.  Nah.  Nah, they're afraid you're going to say something and ruin their plan, their big plan that everybody  figures out anyway before it happens. 
[00:17:30]  I've never seen a radio secret that has lasted until they want to pop it.  People usually rat, catch on, the word gets out, but they're all just phony.  I think there's a new rock station in Philly which has been kicking YSP's ass, which is,  I think, a clear channel station or whatever.  And I think that's why they made the format flip because they had MMR and then that new  station, I think.  Yeah, they're running Jockless or something.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Just music.  Yeah.  Like an iPod.  Delson, what's up?  Man, I'm listening to music.  I feel like killing myself in Philly this morning.  What song is on?  Right now, let's see.  Now it's a commercial.  That's better than what the hell I was just listening to.  They know what they're doing down there, though.  Oh, man.  It's killing me, dude.  Jimmy, you killed it at the Philadelphia tour.  Thanks, bud.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:30]  Harry, Philly, what's up?  Harry.  What happened?  We kind of just explained the whole thing.  They know better.  YSP knows better.  You know, the great YSP.  I don't want to trash them too much because I've got to try to keep my job.  The great YSP.  They know better than we do.  I apologize.  I encourage everyone to go listen to music for the coming weeks until they make their announcement.  I don't want to piss off the company too much. 
[00:19:00]  I'm looking forward to hearing Jet reruns 11 times a day.  What's not the love?  Thanks.  Have a good one.  Punching out.  Chris, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Chris.  Yeah, I'm just calling a complaint.  Did you know I'm down in Philly?  Did you know that this is going to be happening this morning?  We found out yesterday afternoon.  Yeah.  But they were going to do it within 10 days to two weeks anyway, so.  It was crap.  No, they know what they're doing down there.  I fully support the move. 
[00:19:30]  I think it's a great one for Philly and radio in general, so.  What's up?  You got a fan missing you, man.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  I knew I didn't like the guy, what was his name, John Cook?  John Cook.  Cook.  I knew I didn't like him when, I think he was the guy, because I said he looked like  Mohammed Atta, because of his hairdo.  Yeah.  And he got mad.  It was like, he came in and he goes, wow, you can come up with a better one than that,  and I immediately know, you're not a funny person.  No, because that was a good one.  I'm sorry you look like him.  I didn't say you act like him.  But the fact that, exactly what he was, he was just a douche in a suit. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Who got annoyed that he got teased.  Yep.  And the moment that happened, I was like, ugh, what a tool.  That's exactly what happened.  He got his little feelings hurt.  Yeah.  Oh, you come up with a better one than that.  No, that was the reference.  No, that was a good one.  It was my son of the idiot.  It was a good joke.  Well, we could just keep taking calls from Philly, but we'll take a break.  We got $1,000 to give away today. 
[00:20:30]  Gibson S.  With the sound that wasn't approved, that no one liked in management.  Why?  Because it's too short.  Really?  Yeah.  It was too short.  I forget what it was.  It's, you know.  Where'd you?  It's a great one.  I'll find it on my machine.  Well, here's the sound you're...  We need to play it.  Here's the sound you're listening for if you want to win $1,000 today.  Between $7 and $7.30. 
[00:21:00]  We have to find it, but it sounds like...  Where'd you?  It sounds just like it.  It's like that, but half the length.  There it is on number four.  Remember that.  It's on four.  Where'd you?  There you go.  When you hear that between $7 and $7.30, you'll win $1,000 if you're the 10th caller.  877-212-O-N-A.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Phones are lit.  Yep.  There's a bit of turmoil down there in Philly.  It's going to be rough.  Huh?  It's going to be rough to get, like, calls that aren't this, but...  But let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, Joe.  Hey, you know, I get on the...  You know, my car is going to go to work.  I turn on the radio, and there's stupid music on.  I couldn't believe it.  I was like, what is going on?  Well, they think playing music is much better than listening to our radio show, which is  the biggest insult, by the way.  So far, they've played Tom Petty, Running Down a Dream, Pearl Jam, Corduroy, Holy S, P.O.D.  Alive, Jet, Are You Going to Be My Girl, Rush Limelight, and the Toadies Possum Kingdom. 
[00:22:30]  Rush Limelight?  I like Rush.  I like Limelight.  I haven't heard that on the radio in the last...  No.  Oh, keep babbling.  Why don't you, Joe?  Just keep babbling.  All right.  Thank you, Joe, for your support.  I appreciate it.  Ken in Delaware.  Ken, what's up?  Ken.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, I don't want to repeat what that guy just said, but basically the same thing happened  to me this morning.  What? 
[00:23:00]  I said, I don't want to repeat what that guy just said, but the same thing happened to  me this morning in the car.  Oh, you tuned in, and hey, we weren't there.  We weren't here.  Yeah, that's how it works in radio.  All of a sudden, like, it was hilarious because, like, the decision went down.  Within seconds, they wipe any trace of us off their website, off the actual radio station.  I think they had the van repainted already.  It's so infuriating.  And instantaneous. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I was going to go to work and check out the website, but I guess I won't bother  then.  No, there you go.  There you go.  Do you guys have any plans to go to another station down here?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Oh, really?  Absolutely.  This is the funny thing, by the way.  A lot of people thought Anthony and I went back to regular radio because we wanted to  make more money.  The fact is, the deal we made is okay.  It's not, you know, blowing anyone away here.  No, it's not the be-all, end-all radio deal, that's for sure. 
[00:24:00]  And it's so funny when I read about that, that, oh, they just went back to regular radio  because they wanted to make more money.  No, what we really wanted to do is we went back to regular radio because we wanted our stuff.  We just did a really long article for FMQB, by the way.  It's coming out Friday, and we'll make sure it's on the website.  It came out very well.  And we explained that we went back to regular radio because we want a lot more people hearing  our stuff.  That was the main reason why we went back to regular radio. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  We like the satellite.  We like the freedom it gives us, but, you know, we weren't talking to a lot of people.  At this point, you're not going to get as many people as you get on regular radio.  You know, there's an article that came out today about satellite radio ratings, and Howard  is talking to one point, I believe, I don't want to misquote this, so I think it's 1.2 million  people, okay, if you can believe the satellite radio ratings.  He used to talk to 20 million.  Yeah.  And that's exactly how we felt when we were just exclusive to satellite. 
[00:25:00]  We were frustrated.  We were like, we want our show and our stuff to be heard by a lot more people.  It wasn't about the money.  And some of the really hardcore fans of the show are convinced that's why we went back  to regular radio.  No.  First and foremost, we want to be heard by as many people as possible.  Yeah.  That's what you do with a radio show.  You know?  That's what we wanted.  I mean...  We did.  I mean, you could have true freedom if you just hang out with your buddies at a bar and 
[00:25:30]  talk.  But, you know...  No one's going to hear it.  No one's going to hear it, but you're going to have no censorship.  You could say whatever the hell you want.  You know?  And that's kind of the dilemma with the satellite and the regular radio.  But we thought it was important to try to talk to a lot more people at this time.  And while the whole satellite radio world, like, continues to grow.  Yeah.  That was the reason we went back to regular radio.  I'll bet you that number is very accurate because they're going through merger talks.  And everything has to be reported to the Justice Department.  So, I mean, their books are wide open.  I mean, that's probably a really accurate number. 
[00:26:00]  Well, if it's accurate, they're saying that we're talking to a lot less than how it is  on satellite radio.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What a liar.  Well, and that's what's weird because the company had told us differently.  So, who knows?  I know this much, though.  You talk to less people.  I heard the survey was done when we were suspended.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, well, they're not going to...  That's good.  I'm not kidding.  But they're not going to report that.  No, of course not.  You know, because already I see on some of the radio sites, you know, people are laughing 
[00:26:30]  at us that Howard's talking to five times more people on satellite than we are.  Yeah.  But now you're saying that that survey was done when we were suspended for 30 years.  Uh-huh.  But that won't be reported.  No.  It won't be reported that when they did suspend us, like, a lot of listeners dropped their...  Yeah, canceled.  Canceled their subscription to satellite.  So...  Weren't listening.  So, we did not go back to regular radio to make a lot of money.  The deal wasn't that great.  What was great about the deal was it gave us the opportunity to talk to a lot more people, 
[00:27:00]  and we continue to talk to a lot more people.  Mm-hmm.  As frustrated as I am about the Philly situation, because I really think that those two guys  down there are just a bunch of dopes, and it will be proven in the end.  It's always proven in the end.  You know, it's going to be proven they don't know what the F they're doing.  Okay?  Simple as that.  But, and I told, like, you know, corporate, I'll say it again, how frustrating it is that  we have to lose a key market for us because they don't know what they're doing down there.  They just don't.  Mm-hmm.  You know? 
[00:27:30]  And that's not a slam on the company.  And someone then says on instant feedback, because I went silent for a while there, that  I was getting chewed out by management.  I absolutely was not being chewed out by management.  Okay?  I had a nice talk with Tom in the hall as soon as we went to break.  I was not getting chewed out.  I can't tell you the last time I got chewed out by management.  I run the show.  I run the show.  What the hell is it?  It's junior high.  Chewed out.  And to prove that it's not about money, this is, this is, I'm speaking for myself. 
[00:28:00]  All right?  We're not on affiliate anymore.  We're not on YSP anymore.  This will prove, hopefully, to a bunch of idiots out there that we're not doing this  completely for the money.  I want to be back on in Philly sooner than later.  We got to look at the dumb contract to see what our rights are.  But I think Bob is too busy negotiating a deal to have Kid Chris replace us.  That's just terrific.  That's not going to drive me nuts whatsoever, by the way.  That's another story for another day.  But here's the deal.  Simple as this. 
[00:28:30]  I want to get back on in Philly.  I want to be back on in mornings.  I want to take out YSP.  And I want to take out Preston and Steve.  Simple as that.  And I want to do it for free.  I want to do radio in Philly for free to prove that I'm not doing this for money.  Proving that I have the passion to do this.  And we're not done in Philly.  That's what I do now.  And I want to get the word out.  We'll call some of the radio sites like FMQB and R&R and Inside Radio and All Access. 
[00:29:00]  And we'll call Dan Gross in Philly who writes the gossip column.  Simple as this.  I, Opie, want to get back into the Philly radio market and I will work for free.  Simple as that.  That's how much I believe in this show and how much it's going to work in Philly.  And I don't want any station owners all confused like, oh, God, I don't know if we can afford them.  Well, let's just take that out of the equation.  I work for free in Philly.  I work for free in Philly radio. 
[00:29:30]  That's what I say today.  Can I have your money?  I'll give you a few shekels.  But that's what I do because I'm sick of people saying that, you know, oh, they're just going for the money.  They're just going for the money.  They don't really care anymore.  No, I care too much.  That's my problem with this whole thing.  So that's what I do today.  I work for free.  Get me back in a station in Philly.  I work for free.  For slave wages. 
[00:30:00]  Not even.  Free.  Free.  I work for free for another radio company down there in Philly.  Free.  That's what I do now.  And let's get the word out.  Get Dan Gross on the phone.  Let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy, what's up?  Nothing.  I just started on the radio earlier.  What happened to you guys?  What's the boy take you off?  Yeah, well, John Cook thinks that playing the Toadies Possum Kingdom is going to get the job done in morning radio. 
[00:30:30]  That song's catchy.  It is catchy.  Make up your mind.  It's catchy when we played it 10 years ago.  Yeah.  How my mornings suck.  No, that's really smart.  Get rid of Opie and Anthony and then compete with iPods.  That's brilliant.  Now they're playing No Sleep Till Brooklyn.  Well, that's a pretty good, yeah, that's a deeper track by the Beastie Boys.  That's a good one.  I like that one.  I actually have that one on my iPod.  Apparently you ever hear that one.  All right, we're going to move on to other things. 
[00:31:00]  We're going to try.  Ronnie, girl, Philly, what's up?  I'm angry.  I just woke up and my alarm clock was music and it wasn't you and I'm really, my day sucks.  Oh, no.  It's just so funny how radio works, too, because you really become part of some of these people's lives.  Like, they wake up to you, they get into the show, they go out and support the show,  the radio station makes it sound like it's one big family, and then one day they just chop your head off. 
[00:31:30]  I mean, it's just amazing to me.  You're disowned by the family.  Right.  Can I be a pain in the butt for a minute?  Huh?  Can I be a pain in the butt for a minute?  And can I ask, like, can you guys just keep me on hold so I can put you on a speakerphone  and listen to you while I get ready for work?  Yeah, sure.  We can do that for you today.  Love you.  We're just going to take one listener at a time in Philly by the phone.  She's on hold.  There you go.  Our audience just went up by one person in Philly. 
[00:32:00]  We're back on.  We're back on in Philly.  On the phone.  Talking to one.  What kind of ratings could you get for one person listening?  I don't know.  What if she listens 24 hours a day?  I think we get an impressive number.  That would be pretty good.  I think we get an impressive number.  I listen on hold.  What station is that?  No, hold on the phone.  Not the hold.  Let's go to Tony in Chicago.  Tony, what's up, buddy? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, man.  I just want to say I support you guys 100% here in Chicago.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, sir.  I pray to God they don't take you off.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  Don't miss us.  You'll miss us.  It was interesting.  I know how much I could say, but there is some happiness with us and the company, and  they're working on things.  I could say that much.  And they're talking to the radio stations we're on.  And I found this kind of funny.  Remember how we...  And I'm not speaking out of turn.  It's just kind of funny. 
[00:33:00]  You know how West Palm doesn't really like this show and doesn't want it and stuff?  Yeah.  They haven't said no to the negotiations that are going on.  They haven't said no.  I'm starting to like that, West Palm, because they're just weird.  They're just weirdos down there.  They're just weirdos.  They've hated the show since we went on in West Palm Beach a year and a half ago.  They hated us.  From day one, the first memo we got, they basically said, yuck. 
[00:33:30]  A year and a half later, we have this weird relationship with West Palm Beach.  And it was brought to my attention that, let's just put it this way, they could have said  no by now.  Yeah.  And they haven't.  Is that promising?  Honestly, I don't think so.  We're rocking on the buzz, dude.  Right.  But it was just funny to me that they're kind of taking their time and thinking about it  a little bit.  Yeah.  Which I find hilarious.  Just waiting.  Maybe they haven't found the right person. 
[00:34:00]  Maybe they're just going, ah, we'll see what they do.  A little out of sight, out of mind.  And I'll say it again, the West Palm Beach situation, man.  I truly, and I'm not kissing ass right now, because I heard this news yesterday, and my  gut feeling is we're going to be gone in West Palm Beach.  But I have to say it again.  I do respect the PD down there, because he always told us where we stood.  Always.  From day one.  Right.  Which was far away from him as human.  Right.  All of a sudden, he had meetings he had to go to when we were down there. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Had to go play golf.  And then they had their big concert that we were kind of part of, and we had the last  dressing room that was kind of attached to the parking lot.  We get it.  They did the bare minimum for us, and I respect that.  There was really no O&A stuff at the show.  No.  Yeah, that was a fun day.  We went down there 10 months ago.  10 months ago.  And we thought we were going to lose the show as soon as we got back to New York.  It's been another 10 months, and we're just kind of still limping along for them in West 
[00:35:00]  Palm Beach, Florida.  God bless.  And it was brought to my attention that they haven't ruled out.  They haven't ruled it out yet.  Yeah.  If I was a betting man, though, you know.  Come on.  Please.  I mean, please.  But I just found that kind of funny.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Mike in Philly.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, long-time listener.  I'm just wondering why I'm not hearing you on the radio today. 
[00:35:30]  Well, they decided that music's more important, and someone's feelings got hurt yesterday when  I called John Cook a wussy boy.  He really should look up Dave Douglas' career.  It's going to be a lot of fun in the coming months and coming year.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  So they're doing music now.  But, I mean, because then I heard the stupid Opie blew the whole thing up.  No, I'm not stupid, by the way. 
[00:36:00]  I really am pretty calculated.  And it was proven to me yesterday when the corporate told me, no, they were going to  get rid of you guys in 10 to 14 days.  I just beat them to the punch and got some fine shots in.  So, Mike, they're playing music instead of us, so enjoy.  Enjoy.  Have fun with that.  I'm sure that'll work for everybody.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Dan in Philly.  Dan, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I've been listening to you for, like, three months now. 
[00:36:30]  Well, and pretty sad to hear that you guys are going.  Jimmy, you are hilarious, dude.  Thank you, mister.  I loved you and Lucky Louie.  Who didn't?  The critics.  Oh, damn sorry, Jim.  Thanks, buddy.  On the rain kicks ass.  Thanks, fella.  All right, sir.  And it's pretty sad, man, that you guys aren't on anymore because you guys are awesome.  Well, we'll figure something out.  But I mean it, man. 
[00:37:00]  My word has always been my word.  I want to get back on in Philly, and I will work for free to prove to the critics we're  not doing this solely for money.  For free.  I can't wait to hear you guys.  It was a sad day when Karen Buck left.  She was very good to us down there.  That kind of sucked.  Yeah, that was like a final straw kind of a thing right there.  Karen Buck was like the backbone of that station for many years.  And we ran into Tim Sabine for the first time at the Pat Cooper roast.  And I gave him props. 
[00:37:30]  I'm like, man, Tim, it just hasn't been the same since you left.  You knew how to work this radio show in a syndicated market.  You know, that's really, really important.  But yeah, Karen Buck was the final blow.  One by one, they were leaving.  And it just isn't the same radio station that we know and love.  And that was told to me yesterday, too.  Look, all the people that really were behind you guys and got the show.  Are long gone.  It's a new team of managers.  New regime.  New regime.  And I swear to God this was told to me. 
[00:38:00]  And I hope I don't get in trouble for this.  But they decided to roll the dice instead of continue with us.  That's not too infuriating.  They're just going to roll the dice.  Ouch!  I hope he rolls the dice and it comes up positive.  Oh, it's going to get interesting.  It's a stupid fruit.  It's going to get very, very interesting in the coming weeks and months.  I hope he hangs himself.  I hope he auto-asphyxiates with cancer on his ankles and his stupid family finds him. 
[00:38:30]  Yuck!  Didn't like my joke, did you?  Corporate douche.  No.  Didn't like your fine joke.  It was a gem.  Of course it was.  Why your hair blonde?  Creepy Arab.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave?  Yes, sir?  What's up?  Hey, they rolled the dice and it comes up crap.  Not even craps.  Just comes up crap.  They're moving in a different direction towards the fag world. 
[00:39:00]  What a bunch of bitches.  There you go.  Well, there was an email I didn't read on the air that we had a mole within the wall.  And they said the programming department smells of family values.  There's a whiff in the air of family values.  Was written in one of the emails that was snuck out of the YSP compound.  Did the guy say that?  There was a whiff of family values coming from the programming department.  So good luck with that. 
[00:39:30]  That's proven to be very successful when a radio station decides to go that way.  John Cook was moving into a different direction.  Hopefully it was into a gentleman's lap.  Head first.  Let me talk into this.  Silly goose.  Family values.  And what's infuriating is they just couldn't tell us man to man what the F was going on.  That's why I have a massive problem with this.  Massive.  We've been kicked off radio stations before and people told us to our face. 
[00:40:00]  Like Dan Mason when we ran into him and do one of our meetings every once in a while.  He looked us right in the eye and goes, guys, not looking good in some of these markets.  We're going to have to make some changes.  That's a man.  It's frustrating.  You're like, oh, come on, man.  Why don't you support the show a little bit and maybe throw some marketing behind it?  But at least he's a man.  He looks you right in the eye and goes, look, it's not looking good for some of these markets.  And he listed a couple markets.  And guess what?  A few months later, we were gone from those markets.  I respect that.  I really do.  I respect the other PDs that had the balls to freaking look me in the eye and say, you're wrong or this is what's happening. 
[00:40:30]  So don't get me wrong here.  I don't respect the wussy boys that go hiding behind, not even hiding behind emails.  He didn't even do that.  No.  He wasn't even brave enough to send an email that is not looking good.  And don't tell me that, you know, I couldn't play my card or something.  There's things you could do to at least show, look, I'm in a tough situation here.  You're not looking good or something.  Instead of just hiding.  You know what I heard last night?  That he had said he called both of us and we never got back to him. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, wow.  And I was like, I just said, that's an outright lie.  The guy did not even make an attempt to get in touch with us.  There you go.  There's the type of guy John Cook is.  That got me.  He'll just blatantly lie.  That got me.  To try to cover his ass.  That's pretty infuriated.  John Cook, John Cook, John Cook, enemy of the show.  John Cook, John Cook on the old F-O list. 
[00:41:30]  The old F-O list.  An F-O.  I hope he's caught in a rest area with a power drill.  Making a hole to make new friends.  The old F-O list is back.  The old peek-a-boo hole.  Caught in an airport bathroom with tap shoes on.  Like, either you're Gregory Hines or you're going to jail.  Jessica in Philly, what's up?  I don't want anyone not to hear me.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys, I love the show. 
[00:42:00]  I went two years in a row to see you guys in Philly at the virus report, and it was amazing to me.  You were awesome.  Thank you.  I just want to see if you guys, you know, if you don't get back on in Philly, I have you guys on 202, so it's okay with me.  But I want to see if you guys, if you do another virus report, are you guys still going to come down to Philly?  Philly is really important to us no matter what.  We would love to go down to Philly for another comedy show.  But we might be doing something different next year anyway. 
[00:42:30]  We've got to keep mixing it up.  That's good, guys.  We'll still be going down there for appearances and stuff.  It's a huge market for us.  It's a huge market for Jimmy and all the comedians we have on this show.  So it's just a huge, huge market for us.  The ratings weren't as good as we would have liked, but it wasn't like we were a complete disaster, okay?  Thank you, Jessica.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We're going to give away $1,000 between 7 and 7.30.  Do you want to play that sound for everybody, the short sound that Tracy had a problem with? 
[00:43:00]  What's the difference if it's a short sound or a long sound?  She said the promos.  I think they have a promo written.  The home?  What?  Oh.  Oh, no.  They run stations in Philly.  I don't really look like him.  Okay, good point.  You do, stupid.  She said the promos have to be.  That's why.  Because it was hard to put into the promos.  There you go.  That's what you're listening for.  That's what you're listening for. 
[00:43:30]  Not right now.  Good luck.  See, it's short, but the faithful listeners know that clip very well.  Yeah.  The prize pigs might be a little confused trying to figure out what the sound is, but the faithful  listeners are right there with us.  Boom.  Yep.  Right there.  So when you hear that between 7 and 7.30, call and 10th caller, we'll get $1,000.  We're going to attempt to move on.  You know what's one more thing that's annoying about being off at YSP?  It's that we were attacking the other morning show.  It's like, what are you going to do? 
[00:44:00]  Just roll over and bite a pillow and take it?  At least we were attacking the other show and trying to make their lives a little miserable.  Yeah.  Calling out their awful, stupid bits.  It was going to happen, too.  That pillow biter.  I have no doubt in my mind it was going to happen.  Bet you're right.  Bet you John couldn't call because every time he spoke, feathers flew out of his mouth from  biting a pillow.  Just a...  He coughs and feathers just fly out and down.  And people didn't like my choice of insults. 
[00:44:30]  Wussy boy I went with.  Sorry, but half the other stuff I want to say, I can't say anymore.  So wussy boy is what we're down to.  And he is a wussy boy.  He's not a man.  Nowhere's near a man.  That's right.  If you don't see your family, you can never be a true man.  All right.  We'll step aside Giuliani.  Wow.  Wow.  There's some outrage in New York City, and it involves Boston.  Yes.  This is terrific.  We'll get into that next, and we'll do some other things.  We've got to talk about the doctor and the screensaver.  Just amazing. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  And then Hillary had some fun things to say about her marriage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought that was really funny.  Yuck.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Can I point out an interesting stat?  Yeah.  Oh, statistics.  It's always fun.  7 o'clock is the stats hour.  iPhone mystery.  1.4 million sold. 
[00:45:30]  250,000.  Quarter million never activated.  A quarter million iPhones never activated.  And I don't know how that happened.  Other than the fact that my girlfriend and I were having dinner the other night, and Brooke  Shields was at the table behind me.  Did I tell you this?  No.  And she was going to text me, because she didn't want to say it, because she was right  behind us.  So she's like, I'm texting you.  And an hour and 20 minutes later, I got the text, because apparently sitting across from  someone, and finally she's like, did you get my text?  I'm like, no.  And then she had to mouth, Brooke Shields is behind you.  And I went, where's Brooke Shields? 
[00:46:00]  Did you have a signal?  Yes.  You got an hour and a half later?  Yeah.  Well, I figured out the reason, the way it works with AT&T is that when you send a text,  somebody jots it down and runs it to a messenger service down the street, and then they re-text  it.  That's what happened.  Oh, okay.  That is really frustrating.  With AT&T.  Yeah, it really is.  When you're three feet away from the person that is texting you, and you get an hour and  a half later.  I actually caught myself biting my phone.  Did you bite it? 
[00:46:30]  When I put it through the case, I went, ha, ha.  You like to bite things.  The only way I can express.  You're a biter.  Yes, I am.  The iPod thing with the quarter million, not activated?  Presence.  Presence.  That people just didn't want.  That's a good point, too.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  It has a birthday gift or an anniversary gift, and you're like, people waiting for their old  contracts.  But I like my phone, or waiting for their contracts then.  Okay, that makes sense.  Yeah, absolutely.  And also people that were buying them to sell on eBay.  Right.  Yeah, because everyone thought they had a perfect scam. 
[00:47:00]  By the way, just keeping track, we're not on in Philly anymore.  Well, what our fine listeners in Philly are getting to hear this morning is the Beastie  Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Zeppelin, What Is and What Should Never Be.  Oh, thank God.  Green Day, Basket Case.  I bet you they dedicated that one to me.  Corn Freak on a Leash, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Give It Away.  They think, sorry, they think that this will get the job done instead of having our show 
[00:47:30]  on their radio station.  I hate corporate research.  Godspeed.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Dave in Virginia.  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I want to wake up my spouse.  Okay.  Oh, goody.  She's been bitching for a week about the ice maker not working.  Well, guess what's working?  The ice maker.  It's beautiful.  I've got the bucket right here filled with ice.  Okay.  It is wake up your spouse Wednesday.  Too bad he's not the ice man. 
[00:48:00]  It'd be great to hear him wake your spouse up.  Bucket of acid.  All right.  You know how we want this, right, sir?  I got to get the phone right.  I'm going to plant it next to her, and then I'm going to go back and get the ice bucket,  and then I'm going to dump it.  All right.  That sounds good.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Wake up your spouse.  Mm-hmm.  Dave is a bucket of ice.  Wake up Philadelphia!  Man, it'd be great to hear her.  Um, yeah.  Wake up Philadelphia. 
[00:48:30]  And I swear to God, he hung up.  Yes.  I had no idea what that was supposed to be.  Was he going to play another radio station?  Was he going to play YSP?  What was he doing?  They really screw up with this show because they should just stay on the air.  There's a real panic that happens when people try to prank us.  I don't know why.  I think we're very intimidating.  They really do.  They want to get out of it very quickly.  But what does wake up Philadelphia mean at the end of that?  Was that even a prank or was he yelling at us?  And then there was sort of a radio station.  I don't know which station.  Yeah.  What station was he trying to promote? 
[00:49:00]  One that's on in Philly?  Maybe his spouse is John Cook.  I don't get it, sir.  All right.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  We're going to be there on Friday for the big Halloween party.  Yes.  Looking forward to that.  I've been hashing over what costume I want to wear.  I don't want to do the same old thing.  And I kind of came up with an idea last night. 
[00:49:30]  But I want it to be a surprise.  What are you going to dress as?  I'm going to dress like I do every year in my regular clothes.  Regular clothes.  Jimmy, I think it's just creepy when adults dress up for Halloween, man.  But it's a party.  It's kind of creepy.  Women can get away with it.  Hot women dressing up for Halloween rocks.  Yeah.  But then, I don't know.  It's kind of creepy.  It's not my thing.  No.  No.  It's kind of fun. 
[00:50:00]  I don't trust that.  There I am in that picture.  That's a wonderful shot.  I wish I did enjoy it.  Oh, you don't.  No.  But I kind of wish I did.  I'm a shy boy, too.  But I like.  Can you give us a hand on your costume for Friday?  No.  It's just an idea.  I don't know.  I might just end up with the same old thing.  You know.  I kind of like carrying a sword around.  Makes me feel safe.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Well, this is amazing. 
[00:50:30]  Rudy Giuliani.  You know, we got the World Series.  And the World Series is about to begin tonight, right?  Game one.  Yeah.  You got the Sox and the Rockies.  And, of course, you got to go with the Red Sox.  No joke in here, by the way.  Go, Sox, go.  I think most of the country is because, you know, sorry there, Colorado Rockies.  But no one really cares about you.  I want to see the Sox over the stupid Rockies.  You do, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because you hate the Yankees now.  I don't.  And when they put the Orpheum in Colorado and I have to perform there someday, I'll be 
[00:51:00]  happy to root against them.  But right now, Boston's a much better market for me.  So the Rockies can die.  There you go.  Well, everybody knows who Rudy Giuliani is, the former mayor of New York City.  Got us through 9-11, even though on September 10th, most of the city hated him.  Hated him.  But by September, I don't know, 17th or 18th, everyone just was in love with Rudy Giuliani.  He was a hero.  America's mayor, they call him.  It's amazing how he was able to turn everyone around.  Almost everyone. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Almost everyone.  I know I'm talking to some guys out there that are like, I'm not willing to forget.  Some people have never turned.  No.  Right.  But he was a diehard Yankee fan.  Right.  I mean, he'd be at all the games.  It was always about the Yankees.  The Yankee hat and jacket.  He'd be sitting there in his great seat talking to George, talking to Joe.  Uh, just a New York Yankee fan.  Right.  When he was the mayor of New York.  Now he's running for president of the United States. 
[00:52:00]  And it's a little different.  And, uh, yeah.  This is what he's saying today.  Rudy Giuliani, once proudly tossing out the first ball during a Yankees game.  Ball.  He's, uh, um, a Red Sox fan.  I'm rooting for the Red Sox.  Wow.  She should just stop trying to.  What was that?  She's trying to do like a, he's like, hold on to your hats, folks.  Here it comes.  I, uh, well, he is a, uh.  You're trying to act. 
[00:52:30]  Those people are trying to act.  I gotta hear this again.  You're, you're just a news.  Rachel.  You're just a news bimbo.  Just, just tell us what, what he's doing.  Rudy Giuliani, once proudly tossing out the first ball during a Yankees game.  Is, uh, um, a Red Sox fan.  What is that?  Because here's what, I'll tell you exactly what's happening.  She's a woman who doesn't understand what sports rivalry is about. 
[00:53:00]  So she's trying to feign indignation, but she's never felt it for a team because she obviously.  I think I'm with Jimmy on this.  I don't, she doesn't know the, she doesn't understand the importance of a Yankee fan rooting for the Red Sox.  I think Jimmy nailed it.  I really do.  So she's, uh, uh, like, uh, so she's trying to sell it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm with you, Jimmy.  That could just as easily be said as he is rooting for the Red Sox.  Do you understand?  You understand.  You don't have to go, he's rooting for, and then look left and right.  Bang! 
[00:53:30]  The Red Sox!  Ah, hold on, folks.  You're not going to believe this one.  I'm ready to pull over, folks.  I'm ready to deliver a doozy.  Can we hear that again?  Can we hear her awful acting again?  That's great.  Not as great as the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Give it away.  Oh, I love that song.  Give it away now.  Maybe they'll put it under the bridge, and we can talk about what it means.  Yeah, man.  Anthony Kiedis wrote that when he was really in the depths of addiction, man.  Oh, sorry.  Can't talk about it too much more.  I've got to get to the next song.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Sing out the first ball during a Yankees game is a Red Sox fan.  God, does she suck on every level.  It's infuriating to hear her.  Oh, it just makes me angry.  Let's get to the rest of the clip.  Red Sox fan.  I'm rooting for the Red Sox in the World Series.  It's hard enough to say, but for New Yorkers, the betrayal is tougher to swallow.  He betrayed them. 
[00:54:30]  The former mayor dropped his bombshell while campaigning in rival territory, Boston and New Hampshire,  which, by the way, is the state for the nation's first primary.  Hint, hint.  I think he's doing it for politics.  Politicians will tell you anything.  Anything you want to hear.  Get elected.  There you go.  How about this?  I like the fact that at least he's saying a team as opposed to most of these scummy politicians  who will only go, oh, you know, I want a good, safe game.  Who won't, yeah.  A good, safe game.  And keep it above the belt. 
[00:55:00]  The bottom line is we care about what the guy wants to be the leader of the free world.  Yeah.  And we're concerned with which men he's hoping hits the ball farther than the other men.  And more times.  Right.  Who cares?  Than the other men.  He always told it like it is.  And this seems a little different.  Like, here in New York, you've got two massive teams.  You've got the Mets and the Yankees.  So when you admit that you're a Yankees fan, it doesn't make the Mets fans happy, especially  if you're in public office.  But he had no problem with that. 
[00:55:30]  He's like, I'm a Yankee fan.  I'm a proud Yankee fan.  I'm going to throw out the first pitch.  I'm a Yankee fan.  Then you get Hillary Clinton.  Well, I like both teams.  I don't know.  I like both teams.  Both teams.  But this is kind of weird for Rudy to do this.  Rudy Giuliani is a...  Red Sox fan.  I think if it was the old Rudy Giuliani, he would just go, look, as a Yankee fan, it's 
[00:56:00]  just a known thing.  You can't root for the Red Sox.  The old Rudy would have done that.  Well, maybe not, but he wouldn't have answered the question and say he's rooting for the  Red Sox.  Because it's the Rockies as an expansion team, he probably would rather see an old rival  with a team that has kind of taken it in the face for many years.  That's how I feel about Boston.  Even if I was...  I would still rather see...  You would like to see the...  If you were still a Yankee fan, you would like to see the Red Sox win the World Series? 
[00:56:30]  Over the Rockies?  Yeah, I think so.  No, I don't think so.  No way.  Maybe not.  How about this?  How about this scenario?  He's really good friends with Joe Torre and feels a little, you know, loyalty for the  supposed diss that Joe Torre got.  So he's like, screw him.  Yeah, that diss.  Yeah, the five million diss.  Wow.  He is really big, good friends with Joe Torre, but yeah, five million dollar diss. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, we won in seven years.  Here's five million plus a possible three more.  Yeah.  If you win the World Series and Torre's hurt, beat it.  Very hurt.  Wow.  Scott from Chicago.  I'm hearing these rumors too.  I can't confirm this.  CKG, the station we're being heard on at this very moment, is thinking of going to a Spanish  language format.  Oh.  Wow.  Will they carry this show?  That's the question.  How funny would it be if they refused to let us go?  They went urban or Spanish and kept the show. 
[00:57:30]  I've heard that rumor.  I have no idea, but wow.  Gotta love this business, man.  It is just terrific.  Let's see how we're doing in Philly today.  It's Ronnie.  We put her on hold a while ago.  Oh, right, right.  Ronnie.  Oh, it might be on the speakerphone as she's in the shower, though.  Oh.  Can you hear her?  Yeah, she's been on the bowl.  Forget the Philadelphia Inquirer open to page 75.  Still can't go.  All right, well, you said you had something on Hillary, speaking of Hillary. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah, Hillary, apparently they're starting to talk about her relationship with Bill Clinton  because when you're running for president, you need a stable marriage and relationship  if you're married, and we all know what happened with Bill Clinton and the famous Oval Office.  But in Hollywood, you could be like a single parent and make it into the White House and 
[00:58:30]  stuff.  And then you get to date as you're the president of the United States.  Yeah, in Hollywood.  Only in Hollywood.  What movie is that?  Yeah, where he's dating and dancing and people aren't outraged.  Right, right.  People would be just outraged at everything a single president did.  Oh, and rumor has it, a woman was in the White House last night.  Right.  Thank you.  But that would be great.  It was a terrific movie, Dave.  Was it Dave?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:00]  Wow, wow.  Just the gifts.  Did you say the romantic gifts he brings her?  Yes.  We're getting to that.  This is some of the romantic.  Now they got to talk about this Bill and Hillary Clinton romance that's going on, this whirlwind  romance that's going on between this cold fish, Hillary Clinton, and this I'll F anything  Bill Clinton.  He brings her romantic gifts like Mentos and cigars.  Yeah.  It says Hillary Rodham Clinton says, husband Bill often brings her romantic gifts. 
[00:59:30]  This giant wooden giraffe from an African trip, for example, and a Chanel watch that reminded  him of teeth.  Wow, maybe because she has choppers like Mr. Edge, is that it?  Could be.  The Howdy Doody teeth.  And this is my favorite line.  He's so romantic, the former first lady said it in an interview for a November issue of  Essence Magazine.  He's always bringing me back things from his trips.  Like chlamydia and the clap. 
[01:00:00]  Crabs.  Here's a giraffe, whore.  Here you go, you distant iceberg.  Here's a giraffe.  And here's a way to really face up to what happened and really put it in honest terms.  Now, obviously, we've had challenges, as everyone in the world knows.  She calls what happened in the Oval Office with an intern a challenge.  Sure.  To me, maybe the loss of a child is a challenge to a marriage. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  Money problems.  You got kids and you can't afford to send them to college.  But these are challenges.  Your hubby getting some action in the Oval Office, that's not a challenge.  That's him cheating.  And you staying with him.  And she tries to pawn it off as being a strong woman because she knew what she wanted. 
[01:01:00]  She wanted her man.  Just more sickening, neutral language from a mullet idiot who never takes a stand.  Yeah.  She said, while sticking it out might not be for everyone, well, it sure was for Bill Clinton.  Mrs. Clinton said, women should support each other in choices they make in their marriages.  So women should support a woman that stays by her man after he disgraces the office of the presidency, 
[01:01:30]  their marriage, and just stay right by him because you're running for president.  And when she doesn't become president of the United States, how long will it take for her to file for a divorce?  Oh.  Because she's not fooling anyone.  No.  No.  She's doing this because you need to have a stable family life.  Right.  I think you said that, right?  Yeah.  That's why they're starting to pull all these things and then Chelsea shows up in the news every so often  and goes, look, we have a daughter, too. 
[01:02:00]  So they all can't seem to be in the same place at the same time ever.  When was the last time?  I held my grandma's hand more romantically than these two hold hands.  Seriously.  That's the best you see from, quote, this loving couple is like this awkward hand-holding every once in a while.  It's bizarre.  I want to know when the last time the three of these people, this family, was actually together.  Oh, and if you thought it was sick that I said that I hold my grandma's hand more romantically 
[01:02:30]  than they do, what makes it really sick, my grandma's dead.  Oh.  And when I hold her hand, it's still more romantic then.  You keep her in the parlor?  Yeah.  Just her hand sticking out like in the Addams Family, but it's still more romantic.  Hold it.  This is the last line.  She goes, I think it's so important for women to stand up for the right of a woman to make  a decision that is best for them. 
[01:03:00]  She's trying to spin this, her cheating husband and her just being a schmuck that's staying  with him and that stayed with him.  She's spinning it into this empowerment thing.  You know what woman did what was best for her?  Monica Lewinsky.  That's a woman who did what's best for her.  Yeah.  What a dope.  The fact that women buy this crap from her and think she's this powerful, strong woman  is revolting.  Is that how desperate women are for a strong woman? 
[01:03:30]  She knows that she needs her husband to better her chances at becoming the president, which  she just will not be.  But she needs a husband.  She needs a daughter.  She needs the family to look like they're actually a family.  This is the most dysfunctional, separated family I've ever seen.  Not even out of politicians, out of anybody.  They're never seen together.  And Bill Clinton's out on the campaign trail for her. 
[01:04:00]  And you just see him pretty much disgusted with the whole thing.  He's just got disgusted faces on.  He makes these quotes when they ask him questions like, hey, he'll have to ask her that.  And Belly's up to the bar for another drink.  Yeah.  Looking for another chippy.  He can have another 15 years of disgustingly raucous sex wherever he goes.  What, is he 60 now?  I think he just turned 60.  Sure.  Plenty of time left.  By the way, Russ from Alabama.  Opie held Danny's hand more romantically. 
[01:04:30]  Romantically.  Yes.  It just, whatever.  I lost it.  Okay.  Opie held Danny's hand more romantically than Bill and Hillary.  All right.  Hey, Ronnie.  Hello?  Ronnie.  Yo.  Are you still listening to us?  It doesn't sound like it.  Of course I'm listening to you.  I'm getting ready for work.  I got you on a speakerphone.  Oh, speakerphone.  All right.  We're talking to our only listener in Philly at this point. 
[01:05:00]  Shut up.  Well, you are.  Well, you are.  No, no joke.  We're not on.  And I'm talking commercial radio, of course.  No, you're the only person in Philly listening to the Opie and Anthony show today.  Do you feel privileged?  Of course I do.  You're the only one we put on hold.  Unless they found another way, maybe through the internet, satellite, obviously.  But we're talking about just the average listener like Ronnie that would just tune us in on YSP.  So you're the only listener today.  How does it feel? 
[01:05:30]  I rock.  You're special.  I am.  I am freaking special.  Now, if you tell a friend, tomorrow we could have two listeners.  I can't believe nobody else asked you to do that, though.  No, they did not.  That's just gay.  But you're going to have to tell somebody.  And we're going to put two people on hold tomorrow to hear the fine show.  So we could double our audience in Philly.  Yep.  If I call tomorrow, will you do that for me again?  Absolutely.  A hundred percent increase in listenership if she gets a friend. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Then we could put out a press release and show everyone how great we're doing.  Okay.  Now, are they really thinking about replacing you with Kid Chris?  Because if that's true, I'm going to shoot myself in the head.  Don't shoot yourself.  It's pretty obvious that's what's going to happen.  I mean, you know.  No.  Oh, I hate Kid Chris.  Well, no.  Don't shoot yourself.  It's a loser on hold listener.  Could you shoot yourself, though, live on the show?  If you had to.  Okay.  Because that certainly would create a buzz.  If you had to. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  The news would have to report on that, and then everyone would have to tune in that show  to go, wow, this is the show that had a listener kill themselves live on the show.  This is great.  Then we'd be off for a while.  I might shoot myself in the foot or something.  What?  I might shoot myself in the foot.  Maybe not, you know, kill myself, because I do have a daughter.  All right.  I'm going to put you back on hold.  Don't want to lose our only listener in Philly, so I'm going to be very nice today.  There you go.  Ronnie's back on hold, the only listener listening in Philly right now.  All right.  There you go on Clinton, right? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, just a phony statement about a phony relationship, just so she can get some votes  from the, you know, the Midwest, the people that are like, eh, I'm not too sure about  that, but, you know, she is married to the ex-president.  There you go.  My God, man.  Sometime.  Oh.  What?  What happened?  Huh?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Congratulations to Paul. 
[01:07:30]  He won $1,000.  Courtesy of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Paul, what do you have to say for yourself?  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Uh-huh.  Sounds so excited.  Uh-huh.  I, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, congratulations on the $1,000 there, buddy.  Thank you very much.  What are you going to do with the $1,000?  I'm going to spend it.  What do you think?  There you go.  All right, Paul.  Thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Thank you very much. 
[01:08:00]  We got to get a new sound for tomorrow's contest.  Uh, you got one over there?  Possibly?  Yeah.  Uh, something longer?  Uh-huh.  Uh, I like how that guy was, uh, very responsible with his $1,000.  He's going to spend it, of course.  It's called, it's called, um, a word, uh, we can never, ever use, rich.  That's what they call it.  That's what he's going to be.  A horrible banned word, rich. 
[01:08:30]  That's going to be now banned.  Uh, John and Philly, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm missing you already.  I don't know what to do.  Let me send Luca Brasi over there.  Thank you, John.  No, that wasn't the sound for tomorrow.  Uh, thank you, John.  Yeah, that's not tomorrow's sound.  Well, you could do that sound.  Uh, no, I don't think it would be, uh, accepted.  What do you mean?  Let's see.  I do want to point something out while we're looking for the sound. 
[01:09:00]  Sure.  This is why I love the press.  An off-duty cop in a road rage incident shot and killed an unarmed guy.  I think this, the kid he shot was a, was a black kid here in New York named Jason Tirado.  I think so.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, you know, 19 hours later, he was an off-duty cop, and 19 hours later, he turned  himself in, and it's on page 19 of the Daily News, and I think it's on page 13 of the New  Post, or something like that.  Okay.  Off-duty cop shoots and kills an unarmed guy in a car over a road rage incident. 
[01:09:30]  I wonder why it's on page 19 of the Post, of the Daily News, and page 13 of the Post.  I wonder why it's not headline news.  Yeah, that would be a big story, right?  Sure.  Should be a big story.  Like when, uh, Fat Nick, uh, used a racial epithet to attack somebody with a bat, it  was first page news, uh, first page news for weeks.  Oh, for weeks.  Weeks.  But I guess this one's not, oh my god, that's right, both of them are black. 
[01:10:00]  That's what the thing was.  Ah.  Both black.  Okay.  Yeah, here he is, page 13.  Page 13, page 19.  Do you think newspapers are scared to put, uh, those type of stories, like, front and center?  Yes.  Uh, well, it's not, it's scary, it's, again, we know that their political affiliation is  typically, uh, very liberal, and with that comes guilt.  And I'm not trashing all liberals, but I'm saying when it comes to racial stuff, liberals,  you have to admit, you're awful.  Mm-hmm.  With a lot of other stuff, you're right, but with the racial stuff, you're terrible. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  There you go.  Wonderful.  Good.  Page 19, page 13.  Hey, uh, what do we know on the California fires, besides the fact that California is a  burn-it?  Is a burn-it?  Well, uh, the governor spoke.  This morning.  And no one understood what you were saying.  And I have no, no clue.  Either the whole place is burning down, or the fires are out.  Yeah, no.  It's just the oddest thing, still.  They had him, uh, dramatically looking at the fires from above, like he's in a helicopter  or a plane.  Yeah, I get to the chopper. 
[01:11:00]  And he had a cameraman with him, and he was just, like, deep in thought, looking out the  window.  Yeah, you're like, wait, that's surveying the damage.  It's Conan, the barbarian.  It's, yeah.  Yeah.  These are multi-million dollar homes just going down one after another.  Yeah.  They suck.  It's, uh, it's just amazing.  And, uh...  How many houses?  A huge evacuation.  1,300 houses, something like that already?  Destroyed.  Completely destroyed.  Half a million people evacuated.  This is, like, more people are being evacuated than they did for Hurricane Katrina, I believe. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  At this point, right?  Yeah, and then yesterday I heard on the news about how, um, they're putting, uh, some people  in Qualcomm Stadium.  Right.  Down there in San Diego.  And, uh, how it's like, a different scene than we saw, uh, during Katrina.  Um, these people are getting gourmet food massages.  They're getting massages, gourmet food, uh, water, uh, everything they need.  So, basically, you're trying to say that, uh, people aren't just, like, uh, finding a spot 
[01:12:00]  to take, uh, you know, Washington.  No, no.  All the facilities that they could possibly want.  It's, it's really...  It's just amazing how different things are.  It is.  Because a lot of people were saying, I would like to see a similar disaster, uh, in a  predominantly white area.  Although there's a lot of, uh, Mexican, uh, people down there in San Diego.  But I think they'd just skedaddle back across the border until the, uh, the fires go out. 
[01:12:30]  Then they could come back.  But, uh, you know, some well-to-do areas there.  Like you said, these are multi-million dollar houses going up in flames.  And I guess that's, you know, everybody's answer now.  Everyone got their answer.  Um, gourmet food and massages because they, they get tense.  People get tense when their houses burn down.  I see there was some kind of tent city.  I saw one of the pictures.  It looked like tent city.  Uh, yeah.  Well, I always wonder, where the hell do they get all these tents on a, on a moment's notice? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  All the military.  Somebody's making some cash.  On tents.  They were doing massages, though.  In New Orleans, it was the, uh, face and fist massage that was going on.  That's called an adjustment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, hey, uh, we got your story of the day.  So, yeah, that's still, uh, nowhere's near under control, right?  Now, they said that, uh, the winds are dying down a little bit.  Uh, they've got a few of the fires, uh, under control, uh, a lot more than they did. 
[01:13:30]  And it's one of them up to 85% under control, but there's still others that are 15%.  And I don't know how you get a percentage on control of a fire.  Look, uh, one gust of wind.  What's his name on Good Morning America?  He found a flame to do his live report from.  That looks like a gas line.  Uh, it must be, right?  Wow.  Of all the flames you could pick for your live shot, he picked a four-foot flame coming out of the ground like it's just a gas thing.  What a douche.  He's standing in front of a hibachi doing a new report.  A moron. 
[01:14:00]  The heat here.  It's amazing.  And then GMA went real dramatic.  They showed a, uh, a charred kid's bicycle.  They found a charred kid's bicycle.  Oh.  Had a video of that.  It had a kid on it, and he was, like, in mid-newspaper throw.  All right.  Hey.  Nothing really happened.  That is good.  I was reading something about, uh, Arnold.  What was that?  I was reading, uh, I was reading, uh, Arnold needs to activate the alien water sprinklers hidden beneath California. 
[01:14:30]  Pat from Anaki.  Oh.  A little Total Recall, uh, thing.  He needs to put his hand in the, I need to get advice from Quato.  He's looking for Quato so he can get advice on the fires.  Amazing.  Uh, you can see the smoke from space, too.  That's a biggie.  When some of this, uh, stuff happens, you can see the smoke from space.  From space.  When 9-11 happened, you could see the, you know, the fire and the smoke from space.  People do get amazed when you could see things from space, but it's just the planet. 
[01:15:00]  It's higher up.  Look.  Yeah.  It's like, wow, you know?  You could see it from space.  It's...  But isn't it only...  How many miles is that?  Space?  100?  Technically, just, like, 64, 65 miles.  Something like that, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know.  Look at it.  It's, it's, it's blowing out.  The smoke, the plume of smoke is probably going out over the Pacific further than California  is wide.  Oh, easily.  So you could probably see it from space. 
[01:15:30]  You know what else you can see from space?  Uh, you could see, like, quasars, which are probably 10 million light years.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You could see stars.  Other, other, uh, solar systems, suns.  Jimmy makes a great point.  Yeah.  You could see the smoke from space, but guess what?  From Earth, when we look into space, we're seeing pretty far.  Seeing pretty far.  Let's just, let's just go with the moon.  Let's go easy.  How many miles is that?  250,000 or something?  Yeah.  We could see that. 
[01:16:00]  See that pretty well.  It's really funny, like, the Hubble telescope was designed to see the beginning of time.  They can't get through this certain space dust.  There's certain stuff they can't see through.  But they, they said the equivalent of how good it is, is if you were in New York, you  could differentiate between two fireflies in, uh, in Tokyo.  But why would you want to do that?  Because what happens is, fireflies hate when you lump them together.  Like, a lot of people would say, oh, fireflies look alike, and they, they've gotten a lot of 
[01:16:30]  their special interest groups together, and firefly Americans are very offended.  Yes.  Yes.  And they said, if you can't differentiate between us with a silly telescope and it's  crap.  From halfway around the world.  We agreed.  There's a problem.  There's one.  Oh my God, there's the other.  Send this thing up.  Hey, let's, uh, let's go to Larry, and of course, uh, uh, we, all right.  What happened to Larry?  Larry.  Your mother, Larry.  Larry.  All right, he's gone.  Hey, this, uh, story made us laugh really, really hard in the office, and it's a tough 
[01:17:00]  day for us to be, uh, laughing.  Yeah.  But this one definitely made us laugh.  Uh, listen to this dummy.  Well, prosecutors are asking the public for help in their investigation against a Manhattan  child therapist caught with porn on his computer.  Dr. James Bond.  All right, porn on his computer.  Child psychologist, yeah.  That's right.  Oh boy.  That's not what made us laugh, obviously.  That's probably not, by the way, that's probably not, I'm gonna, I'm gonna guess, I've not  heard this story, but I'm gonna guess that's not the whole story, because that's not really 
[01:17:30]  bad.  W-Y-S-P sucks dot com.  Interesting.  Yes.  Um.  And after, by the way, excuse me, after that last awful point I just made, I now understand  why they took us off the air.  They're using jokes like that.  Ah, this is where it, uh, gets exciting and fun.  Man, we live for this crap.  Secretly, we live for this crap.  Uh, no, Jimmy, there's more to the story.  Did a child, was it a child psychologist working with kids?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, child porn on his computer.  What would make you laugh? 
[01:18:00]  Hmm.  Seriously, think it out though, Jimmy, seriously.  Um, if there were photos of him having sex with me in 1970.  Would get a chuckle.  Your irony would be like, wow, I don't remember you.  I know.  Wait, wait till you hear this one.  On his computer, Dr. James Bonsek was arrested Thursday after a maintenance worker found pornographic  pictures of young boys on his screensaver.  Bonsek, actually. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  Oops.  Exactly.  You know, maybe.  Dude, we didn't even hear the rest of the story.  We just started howling in the office.  Howling.  On his screensaver.  On his screensaver.  Set to go into screensave mode every 30 seconds.  Right, right.  Gotta save this screen.  That's a, that's a rookie mistake.  How, how frothed up are you that you have to have it right on your screensaver?  On your screensaver, and you know, your screensaver is meant to save your screen, so it had to  move around a little bit.  So it was just some awful kiddie porn going from corner to corner of his screen. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, just bouncing from, from border to border.  I guarantee what happened was this dummy, like my, I did the same thing, opened it, I stole  an idea, which was like, I never had my screensaver be my photos.  I was at his place, and his screensaver is pictures of, you know, his photos.  So I set my, my computer to do that, and I guarantee this guy didn't realize.  That it was going through his whole library of photos.  Yeah, like a slideshow.  He didn't know how it worked.  So it just, yeah, popped up. 
[01:19:30]  Bonsek was arrested Thursday after a maintenance worker found pornographic pictures of young  boys on his screensaver.  Bonsek actually lost his job as a school social worker in 1996, after former students accused  him of misconduct.  How amazing is that, though, on your screensaver?  What's wrong with the Apple?  Nothing at all.  It's actually, Renee just brought me an Apple, but the bottom line is, it's tapering.  The Apple is wide on top and very narrow on the bottom.  It looks like my Apple has jaw cancer. 
[01:20:00]  You ever see somebody after their jaw's taken off, and they're talking into a spit bag?  They just look silly.  They really do.  It's just don't talk.  Write it down.  Just IM me.  Hey, this is Jamie in Philly.  I'm just saying, I miss you guys already.  Thank you.  We're missed.  Hello?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys there?  Yeah.  You know what?  I just, I know you're probably tired of explaining it, you know, but I turned on YSP and heard 
[01:20:30]  music, and right away I knew something was wrong.  So, I mean, I tried calling you guys before and never got through, and luckily I got through  this time.  Can you just tell me, you know, what happened?  What's YSP?  I guess, yeah, having been listening for the last month, we've been hinting at this.  Like, there was something wrong down there, and they decided to go in another direction,  which I think is really, really stupid.  Really stupid.  So, yeah, I've been listening. 
[01:21:00]  I guess I'm just, I'm just kind of thick.  No, I don't mean to trash you.  Maybe you weren't listening when we were talking about that situation over the last month,  but it's been painfully obvious ever since our virus show down there that something was  going on, and for some reason they were, I don't know, they just lied to our faces.  The latest one is now this John Cook is saying that he did call Ant and I, and that's just  a flat-out lie.  No, we never called.  But that's what a wuss boy will do. 
[01:21:30]  You know, they'll just panic and then start making up lies to try to save face, but it's  too late at this point.  Everyone knows he's not a man.  He's just not a man, this John Cook down there.  It's one of these situations where the station was what it was back in, as they say, the  day, and there were people there that were supportive of the show, very cool, we got along with them  very well, and then they bring in new people, and when new people come in and the old people  go out, you got to figure out if you're going to get along, if they have these new harebrained 
[01:22:00]  ideas, if they're going to keep you, and apparently this guy didn't want us.  It's weird, in radio, it's the strangest thing, when a new PD comes in, for some reason they  can't work with the old people at the station, they have to completely clean house and bring  in their own people, which I just never understood.  Because why not embrace the show that's doing pretty well on that station, and try to make 
[01:22:30]  it even better?  Maybe that's your job, is to try to now make it even better and get it back to where it  was when we were doing afternoons for YSP, back in the day.  But this guy was just a complete, just a complete, dude, in all my years in radio, I mean, he's  right there with this Dave Douglas from our old station AAF in Boston.  He is right there with Dave Douglas, just a wussy boy, not a man, will look you in the  eye and tell you something that is just flat out not true, and then goes and hides after 
[01:23:00]  he tells you that he's looking forward to working with you, and flipping the station  back to rock, it's going to be great for the station, great for you guys, and we can't  wait to have you guys down here.  I mean, they actually drove to New York and sat across from a table, and I'm sitting here  going, well, what changed between that and a mere three days later?  Yeah.  What the F could have happened?  He just didn't like the show, and he's a megalomaniac and a douche. 
[01:23:30]  All right, if he didn't like the show, then you know what, then have some weird excuse  why he couldn't make the trip to New York, or don't come to New York at all.  Something happened where he just didn't like it.  Something happened, and I would love to know what.  My comment, I'm sure, didn't help.  Family values.  Family values.  I don't know how you get rid of a top-rated show.  I just don't know how you do that.  We try to keep it, I'll be honest, Tim, I'll be honest, we do try to keep it honest on  this show.  We weren't a top-rated show, but we weren't stuck into a point where we should have been thrown  off the air, okay? 
[01:24:00]  I mean, the fact remains, because they will report it differently in the paper, the last  ratings period that was important, we were in fourth place, men 18 to 49.  That's why we do this radio show, to talk to, sorry, to the ladies.  I mean, we want them, too, obviously.  But in general, we really want to do very well, men 18 to 49.  We were okay.  We were right there.  And actually, the last few trends, we were kind of trending up.  So it looked like the show was moving in the right direction.  Men 18 to 34, which is pretty important, too.  We were in third place, all right?  We weren't, like, setting the Philly ratings on fire. 
[01:24:30]  I mean, Preston and Steve had a big lead, but we were doing okay.  And we were looking forward to the next growth period.  Right.  You know, it doesn't make sense.  And, you know, time will prove my point.  Time will prove my point.  You know, we're not going to forget about this anytime soon.  We still think of Dave Douglas and that douche.  That douche that had no you-know-what.  Well, hopefully I'll catch you guys on XM.  And this is why terrestrial radio isn't going to go anywhere, you know? 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Hey, Jimmy, I saw your show.  I think it was on HBO.  I didn't notice.  But it was, like, an hour show.  And you were great.  Thank you.  You were awesome.  It was on HBO, yes.  By the way, just a quick thing.  We've been plugging the Monster Inn DVDs, which are in stores.  A lot of people, I mean, a lot of people have told me they're having trouble finding them.  I think they're supposed to be in Best Buy.  They're in FYE.  I just don't know what stores they're in.  I know Walmart turned us down, which we knew they would, and one more.  But they're in Virgin, so try to find them there. 
[01:25:30]  I got a lot of complaints in Connecticut, so my apologies.  Hey, Tim, you know, we're going to try to get back on in Philly.  And I announced earlier, and I got to get it to Dan Gross from the Philadelphia Inquirer.  I am more than willing to work for free in Philadelphia, more than willing, to prove that it's not about money  and that it's about passion and believing in the show and knowing we can do a good job down there.  So we're going to do everything we can.  And we – what?  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah.  All right, Tim, thank you. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go to Michael in South Jersey.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, man, I must know what I feel like how the Baltimore fans felt when they woke up  and the Colts were gone that morning.  That was one of the most amazing things that ever happened in sports.  I mean, it is right up there.  One morning, yeah, Baltimore woke up and realized that in the middle of the night,  they had moving vans, moving the team out of Baltimore.  No one had a clue.  You guys are like the Eagles to me, man.  I feel the same way that the Eagles jumped up and moved, man. 
[01:26:30]  But see, here's the difference.  We didn't want to move.  We were kicked out, kicked out in such a bad way.  I hope I have communicated that.  Yeah, but the Baltimore thing was amazing.  They were able to pack that whole stadium overnight.  I mean, the logos and everything were gone off the stadium, man.  They just – they hauled ass in the middle of the night.  Right.  I know what they feel like now, man.  All right, Michael.  I can't believe I woke up.  You guys were gone.  Yeah, well, I think more and more people are realizing that because now they're just lit again. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Do we have tomorrow sound?  Did we play it?  Yes, I have it, but we didn't play it.  All right.  Do you want to play it?  Yes, here it is.  This one dedicated to the month of Eroctober.  I bring nothing to the table.  When you hear that tomorrow between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller, you're going to win the next $1,000.  Okay?  And that sound will be up on onaradio.com. 
[01:27:30]  That's the place to go for the show rundowns as well.  And the key is, remember, you have to hear that phrase, not when you see evidence of it in Eric's work.  Right.  Because it'll be tempting at 6.03 to start calling.  Sorry, Eric.  Let's go to Mike in Philly.  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to say my buddy listens to you guys all the time, and all I hear from him all the time is how you bash Preston and Steve all the time.  And I just want you guys to say how we beat you guys. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I know.  We're up here.  What?  We're number one, and we got you all kicked off the air.  Now, first of all, we didn't bash Preston and Steve all the time.  We did take our shots.  And good for you.  There's a lot of people listening to Preston and Steve.  We honestly think that it's a sucky show.  What can I tell you?  Oh, it sucks about it.  It doesn't suck because they frunkus.  I hate you, Mike, more than anything.  I got to like Mike.  I hate you.  It's hurting my feelings.  It's suck because they frunkus. 
[01:28:30]  Let me think that over for a while.  For those of you that keep asking me what frunkus means, it is from the Latin root meaning to frunk.  To frunk.  Yes.  It's F-R-U-N-K with a silent C-H-E at the end and those two stupid dots over one of the letters.  Stupid dots.  What are those things called?  The Germans can't get enough of them?  Humlaut.  Humlaut.  Wow.  What is it called?  Humlaut.  How do you know?  Are you a linguist? 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  Okay.  He's a cunning linguist.  All right.  Unfortunately, the Philly situation has really shut down the phones today.  No one can get through to do Wake Up Your Spouse or any of the other fine things we do with this radio show on a Wednesday.  It is Whip Em Out Wednesday, but it's all Philly calls.  Yeah.  Passionate Philly listeners pissed off today.  There you go.  Maybe you can just tune on YSP and listen to some Chili Peppers that you're not listening to on your iPod because you're bored of it. 
[01:29:30]  Enjoy.  Well, no, Jimmy.  Recently, instead of having us on, they played U2 Pride in the name of love.  Uh-huh.  I'm a big U2 fan, so that's tough to handle, that one.  Nirvana.  I'm a huge Nirvana fan.  They played Lithium today.  Foo Fighters, Times Like These.  Linkin Park Crawling, which is cool.  And then Ozzy Osbourne.  Mom, I'm coming home.  He's only playing Ozzy because he's expecting me to now speak highly of the face.  Oh, right.  Right.  True.  I'm not that shallow. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Ozzy can fall into a ditch filled with feces.  What are you thinking of them apples?  Stupid otta face.  What are you thinking of that?  You do look like him.  Sorry.  He didn't like your joke.  I know he didn't.  And I hated his faggoty corporate smile.  His little fruity corporate smile when he went, hey, you couldn't come up with a better  one than that?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Don't be passive aggressive.  That's a woman's quality.  That was a good one.  You come up with one.  That meant that he was very bothered by that.  Of course he was. 
[01:30:30]  Very bothered.  Unfunny people hate being teased.  And we're talking about John Cook, wussy boy, that's now in charge of YSP.  He knows what he's doing.  You know, instead of listening to this show, it's tunes that you've heard a million times.  Yeah.  A million effing times.  Like, I try to get into people's heads sometimes.  I'm like, I'm sitting there.  I'm like, all right.  How would you even think that playing this crap is better than what we're doing?  Seriously.  Yeah.  We're not on every day, but our average is pretty up there.  Like, is someone really just like, oh, God, Mom, I'm coming home. 
[01:31:00]  I haven't heard this song in at least 10 minutes.  I got to crank it up.  I got to crank this one up.  Yeah.  I just don't get it.  He didn't like the fact, I guarantee this is a personality thing, because he also didn't  like the fact, and this is, that it was pointed out, how sloppy the format change was done.  All right.  That was sloppily handled.  No fault of Kid Chris's.  I mean, that wasn't Chris's fault.  I didn't say that on the air.  We did.  We said it, because it was weirdly done.  Can I just jump in here, Jimmy? 
[01:31:30]  All right.  All right.  It should be brought up.  Yeah.  I was very, very bothered when we were part of that format switch, and I knew something  was like, I felt like the guy really didn't know what he was doing.  I really did.  They promoted all day, or for maybe more than a day, that there was going to be a huge announcement  on Kid Chris's show at 5 o'clock on YSP.  Right, right.  And everyone knew that that meant probably The Rock is coming back, but they were going  to officially announce that, and they wanted Aunt and I and Jimmy there, and we came in,  and we hung out with Kid Chris, and we had a good time with him, whatever. 
[01:32:00]  And then all of a sudden, I see a camera guy in there, and there's a banner on the wall  that's like a plastic banner that is not even put on the wall straight.  It's kind of sideways, and it's the old logo, the Free FM logo.  And it was tiny.  It was tiny.  That was the only idea you had at this station was changing formats, and it was just us in  the studio.  And there was a camera guy in there.  I'm like, wow.  And I'm thinking as a radio guy, I'm like, what a great opportunity.  You're going to flip formats, and this is going to be on the news.  They have a good connection with Fox down there. 
[01:32:30]  And the banner is just kind of askew, just kind of hanging.  They had to try to keep taping it.  Remember the Scotch tape?  It kept falling.  It kept falling and showing the new logo, and the camera guy's even like, all right, well,  maybe I can make something out of this.  This is the big reveal.  And then the big reveal, they pulled the banner, and then there's the new logo.  And I'm like, wow.  It just should have been much more exciting than this.  A lot bigger.  And then Kid Chris made the announcement, and then they played this long production piece  talking about how The Rock is back.  And then I'm thinking to myself, what a great opportunity. 
[01:33:00]  You got a huge amount of people listening right now.  You should hang and have a party atmosphere for at least a half hour to an hour.  Like, wow, it's back, and MMR's in trouble, and we're going to be playing rock, and we  got the attitude back, and we're so excited.  Maybe beers and champagne, maybe a little party.  And that was it.  All of a sudden, Kid Chris plays the first song, and John Cook goes, all right, cool.  Thanks, guys.  And that was it.  And we walked out awkwardly like, wow, this is the first day of this. 
[01:33:30]  And I thought to myself, they're in trouble.  And I immediately, because then we went to the steak joint, I think, or that was the next  day, whatever.  I immediately called corporate.  I'm like, I'm really bothered with the situation down here.  I'm really bothered.  It was handled badly.  And we teased him on the air.  I know you said something, but it wasn't horrible what you said.  It was just pointed out.  It was sloppily done.  It was poorly done.  And the bottom line is, again, a guy, an unfunny corporate men's room tapper, which  is what he is.  He's a men's room tapper. 
[01:34:00]  He brings his own empty shopping bags into every men's room just in case.  I cannot handle being criticized or things like that.  And that's, I think, a big part of the problem.  And that was the issue I had with YSP when we went back to them, is that the lack of passion  as far as a radio station goes.  I'm like, wow, there is no passion in this place.  And there was Karen Buck, and she finally gave up.  I don't know what her issue was, but I feel like she gave up.  And she had no choice.  She just had it. 
[01:34:30]  Because she was still trying to do the rah-rah, I know what this place could be.  And it was just like, it was nothing.  Yeah.  And this was stuff I was saying behind the scenes of corporate.  I'm really bothered.  They seem really lost down there.  And if this format flip and how they did it is any indication, I don't really see how  they're going to turn this thing around anytime soon.  Turn this thing around.  It would have been cooler if they just had somebody say, the Rock is back, and they  went, ta-da.  It was horrible.  And again, it wasn't Chris's fault. 
[01:35:00]  I'm not even trashing him.  I don't know what he's all about, because people are like, oh, you're going to start  trashing him?  I don't really know what he's about.  He's been able to play it perfectly where he's friends with us and Howard, which is  amazing.  But whatever.  You know, we'll see what his true colors are as this moves forward.  But I don't have an issue with the guy, as I sit here today.  No.  He never, like, trashed us that I know of.  No.  But the banner then curled up.  And then the Fox guy is like, can someone, like, string that out? 
[01:35:30]  So the camera guy is even like, can someone string that out?  I'm trying to get a good shot of this for, you know, TV.  All right.  They're playing Dirty Deeds on Dirt Cheap.  I like ACD.  I happen to like Bond Scott a lot, and let's hope that John Cook winds up the same way he  did, choking on his own vomit in a chilly car.  Guess who you look like.  And now it's Beck.  Now it's Beck Loser.  I guess we're the losers, so maybe they could dedicate that to us today. 
[01:36:00]  Attack.  What?  Oh, we got a break?  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm very happy today in 2L on the side for the awful film situation.  In two hours, we got R. Lee Armie calling in.  Oh, yeah.  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. 
[01:36:30]  I'm very happy.  Hoorah!  He's very entertaining.  I was gone when he was in the studio.  Yes.  He's called us a couple times.  He gives some good radio there.  Oh, man.  He was talking about his past.  Oof.  No wonder he ended up in the Marines.  Not the best relationship with his dad.  No.  Oof.  Oh, yeah.  Brutal.  Maybe we'll get into that later today.  One million people forced to flee California wildfires.  That's just an amazing number if you think about it.  Yeah.  One million people. 
[01:37:00]  It's got to be five, ten houses.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  How many houses are done?  1,300?  I don't know.  I would think more than that.  1,300 plus.  1,300 plus.  Well, finally, there's a half a million left other than their houses are all burned.  Yeah.  What are they?  30?  30 to a home?  And the winds are going to die down by, what, later today, I think.  I think they're saying later today, finally.  I don't know how they can figure that out, but they've figured out that the winds will die  down later on today. 
[01:37:30]  The Santa Ana winds.  And then they'll probably get a better grasp of the situation out there in California.  I used to like that.  When I lived out there, the Santa Ana winds, it was like nice, warm heat.  Just a hot breeze.  Mmm.  You really like that?  Yeah.  It's fresh.  It's warm.  Why would you like that?  Because it was like around this time of year, and in California, usually it's the start  of the rainy season.  It's just raining.  Yeah.  And then you get the Santa Anas coming in, and it would be nice and dry and hot. 
[01:38:00]  They sure could use some rain right about now.  Well, let me tell you.  Let's go to the map and see if they're going to get that well-needed rain here, and then  we'll talk about the southeast.  In a drought situation, they're going to be out of water in about 80 days.  There you go.  That's what they say.  Georgia, going to be out of water in 80 days.  Oh, really?  So that means everyone in Georgia will die of thirst, I guess.  They make it sound that imperative.  What do you mean they're going to be out of water?  There's a huge drought going on. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, no.  And the reservoirs will just dry up, and they won't have any water.  You'll turn your faucet, and nothing will come out for the first time ever.  I've got to get into some of that bottled water stock.  Yes.  I'll be shipping those down there.  Like crazy.  Hey, in other news, by the way, to the faithful listeners, thanks for bearing with us today.  We greatly appreciate it.  It's a weird day for us.  Some idiot on Instant Feedback.  Get over it.  They're saying get over it.  John C. from Philly. 
[01:39:00]  It's like, we get it.  You're not on in Philly anymore.  Get over it.  Dude, it's two hours old.  You've got to give us a break every once in a while.  It's two hours old.  This is next week, and we're like, and another thing.  And it's not, you know, the mic isn't working, and we're just going off on that.  It's kind of important.  It's a bit of a distraction.  And seriously, it's two hours old.  Like, I could go to the phones right now.  People are finding out for the first time right now that we're not on down in Philly 
[01:39:30]  because they listen to the show later on in the morning because they don't have to get up as early.  Look at the phones.  They're all about what the F is going on.  But one is the feedback, or he's going to talk for everyone.  Why don't you just get over it already?  It's been two hours.  Get over it.  Okay.  Maybe you don't understand passion.  Maybe you don't understand what passion is all about.  How about you get over, you know, something that happens in your life.  Right.  That kind of affects you and changes your job status or something like that. 
[01:40:00]  Just get over it.  In two hours.  Yeah.  Seriously, it's two hours old officially.  Tiny store clerk swings axe at robber.  This is the dumbest story ever.  This is the video of the day on all the news shows.  They're showing this one ad nauseum.  Some little Turkish woman.  What?  Little Turkish woman.  And recently you were telling me that this is the type of videos you like watching on YouTube  and Break.com.  Oh, absolutely.  All the other video sites. 
[01:40:30]  Surveillance camera footage from convenience stores being robbed is just an all-day event.  You can sit there at break and just watch them.  They're fascinating.  Sometimes people get killed.  Sometimes not.  Sometimes the bad guy gets killed.  Sometimes no one gets killed, but it's a great fight.  Yeah.  It's just entertaining.  It's real-life crap.  And this one, some Turkish woman defended herself against an armed gunman with an axe.  Yeah, let's follow this story closely because this isn't going to play out well in the coming months. 
[01:41:00]  No.  Because most of the time when a clerk's in one of these situations and the news tries to interview them,  they're like, ah, no comment, no question.  They don't want any attention on the fact that they just fended off a scary, scary robber.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, because now the robber, I'm thinking, we'll get to the audio in a second here,  now the robber's friends are laughing at him.  Yeah, he's being mocked.  He's being mocked at a 90, I think she was less than 90 pounds. 
[01:41:30]  85 pounds.  85-pound Turkish woman with an axe fended him off.  Not exactly the videotape you want to take back like in Menace to Society.  Right, right, right.  You want to take that one back and show your buddies.  Right.  But here's the story.  Oh, by the way, she's under five feet tall, too.  Yeah, she's like a progeria kid with an axe.  Yeah.  Stupid thing on her head.  She's officially a midget.  I think midget starts at, what, 410, something like that.  I think she's officially a midget. 
[01:42:00]  She's little and she's just rail thin.  Right.  The surveillance video is really stunning.  A tiny clerk right there defending her store from an armed robber by brandishing an axe.  This happened on Long Island.  CBS 2's Jennifer McLogan spoke to the brave young woman about her frightening experience.  She stands less than five feet and weighs only 90 pounds, but Hafizeh Sahin can wield an axe like Paul Bunyan.  I said, get out of here, please, get out of here. 
[01:42:30]  I don't want you here.  I grabbed an axe and then trying to hit him.  Did you fear for your life?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, this is a perfect example why ONARadio.com rules Stephen S. from Bayshore.  He does the show rundown.  Now, you've got to see this video.  This video will be up on that site later on today.  Later on this morning, matter of fact.  Because you've got to see this tiny little thing with this really strange-looking axe, by the way.  It looks like she brought the axe from her homeland in Turkey. 
[01:43:00]  It's like I explained it as a witch's axe.  It's bizarre looking.  It's like a shortened Grim Reaper, a little sickle.  This is how it should have ended.  Get out of store.  Leave me, leave me.  That's how it should have ended.  They call her a brave woman.  She's being stupid.  Yeah, we look at this stuff a little differently when you had the subway Superman jumping on the tracks to save that guy and having the train run over him.  Yeah.  Everyone was praising him as a hero, and we weren't praising him. 
[01:43:30]  We were saying, this guy's stupid.  Yeah.  He's a dummy.  And this woman, stupid.  Stupid.  Especially because she's talking to the press about what she did.  Yeah.  Guy's going to come in there and go, you made me look the fool.  That's right.  Today at her workplace, friendly, quick mart of Brookhaven on the Montauk Highway, with her dad and stepmom looking out,  Havisi demonstrated how, alone in the store, she protected herself from a robber who aimed a gun at her head and threatened to pull the trigger.  Police say it was all caught on videotape. 
[01:44:00]  He produces a handgun, as you can see, he's pointing it directly at her head, demanding money.  We think he's trying for either telephone there or to take money from her personally.  This is where she removes the axe to defend herself.  And you can see him pointing the gun at her.  And she chases him out of the store.  She was just hysterical, you know, crying.  But she beat the guy off.  I'm surprised that he was like, he was about 62.  She beat the guy off, huh?  Yeah, she was really upset. 
[01:44:30]  Wow, man.  That's what was, uh...  Doesn't seem like she was that upset if she beat the guy off.  That was the quote.  Yep.  The funny thing is, uh, that I like the reference they used to Paul Bunyan.  Yeah.  Couldn't they have updated with the axe?  He swings an axe like Jack Torrance.  Right.  She could barely swing the axe.  She could barely get it over her head.  There was no real swinging of the axe going on.  It's got a long stick with a little teeny Hitler mustache blade on it.  And the, uh, the, uh, gunman was quoted as saying,  I couldn't believe when she brought out the ask. 
[01:45:00]  I did try the best what I can do, you know.  Havise is a co-owner here, a new bride, recently married.  She says she wants to have children and would not hesitate again to pick up that axe.  Reporting from Brookhaven, Jennifer McLogan, CBS 2 News.  Well, police are still searching for the robber.  And while they say Havise was remarkably brave,  they also say she was very lucky. 
[01:45:30]  They do not recommend putting up a fight against an armed robber.  There you go.  Someone with some sense to them.  And we recommend you never talk to the media about it  and brag about how your tiny, tiny little body fended off a monster.  We're actually saying don't do anything this idiot from Turkey did.  Right.  What a dolt.  Really dumb.  Gun beats axe in a fight.  Every time.  Face to face. 
[01:46:00]  Gun beats axe.  Don't make a maniac out of me.  I would sit there and go, look, I don't make enough money for this.  Take whatever the hell you want.  It's not the store owner.  It's a clerk.  Let him have whatever the F he wants at that point.  The family owns it, I think.  Oh, the family owns it?  Which doesn't matter.  They should still give the money up.  Wow.  Well, of course you give the money up.  A little stupid long axe.  You do.  Shorts all insured.  All right.  It's not an axe.  Quickie Mart.  Following the news here, well, Halloween is eight days away or something like that. 
[01:46:30]  Less than eight days, I guess, right?  I know.  I've got to hang that stupid sign on my door.  It is the law, Jim.  And every day we're just giving you a little taste of what the news is doing as far as Halloween goes.  Yeah.  Doing their Halloween stories.  Mm-hmm.  You know, because there's scary people out there.  They want to scare you.  Or they want you to have healthy treats for the kids.  Oh, really? 
[01:47:00]  Is that another thing?  Healthy treats.  Here's today's Halloween angle.  Every day is something different.  Trick or treat!  Ah!  With the years.  Hey!  Sorry, that would be me.  Hey!  That's me on Halloween.  Let's separate a little bit.  I enjoy the screaming kids saying trick or treat.  It's adorable.  That's me.  Trick or treat!  Hey!  Just firing out the window.  Look, it's a little soldier coming to my door. 
[01:47:30]  I hope you're armed for real.  Now get off my lawn.  It's mined.  That would be great if you mined your lawn.  I'll just mine it.  Candy here.  Good luck.  Daddy, what does face toward enemy mean?  Leave the trick or treaters alone.  Oh, okay.  I won't shoot them.  It's an Oral Team commercial. 
[01:48:00]  Spookiest holiday approaching.  Consumers are looking to celebrate.  The most popular Halloween activity this year?  Of course.  Giving out the treats.  Now, candy everybody wants.  But with childhood obesity rates on the rise, how can parents make sure their kids don't  overdo it?  I know.  For Halloween that you should throw little gym memberships into their bags.  Yeah, they'll love it.  You throw them in their bags.  They open their bag.  You throw a set of parents that knows how to control their little fat pig child's eating 
[01:48:30]  habits.  Who cares?  A bottle of water for the kids?  You know what?  Let the kids have their stupid candy on Halloween.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Life's tough.  Give them their day to just eat as much effing candy as they want.  Worry about their health issues another day.  Yeah, but then you might end up like the Nagels.  Huh?  Having to worry about their boy.  Did you stuff the candy in your little fat face, E-Rock?  Yeah, he would store it in his neck pouch for winter.  When did we start talking about enabling? 
[01:49:00]  We're talking about- E-Rock, did you just like, as you're trick-or-treating, you went  home with no candy in the bag, just empty wrappers because you were just shoving candy  in your face?  No.  Okay, hey, I-  No?  No.  Every November 1st, he would just wake up with a bellyache in the runs.  Just firing out candy corn like a machine gun.  And he would actually eat so fast, he would eat a bunch of wrappers too, not knowing.  He'd pick him home from Halloween with his little hands all chocolatey, and he'd go, 
[01:49:30]  I ate all my candy, and he was 16.  You know, I just got a bad retard.  Swallowing your gum and having problems as it's trying to exit.  There wasn't a lot of Halloween candy I could eat.  Why?  Because I can't eat chocolate and caramel and stuff.  Why?  You're that fat and you can't eat chocolate?  No, I don't like it.  It doesn't agree with me at all.  What are you, lactose intolerant?  No, I just, I never liked chocolate or caramel or marshmallows, things like that. 
[01:50:00]  I'm a communist.  What is your favorite candy?  Yeah, what is your favorite candy?  What are you fattening up on?  Probably like Starburst.  Starburst fruit chews.  I know.  Compared to chocolate.  Starburst, one Starburst is good.  Anything after one, it just makes you feel like you're going to go into a diabetic coma.  My sister's married to Mike, right?  Mike's side of the family, love all the sweet candy.  Just all that awful green apple sour.  Like when you were a kid, yeah.  All that stuff I would just throw away.  Like, I don't want any of this crap. 
[01:50:30]  And hates chocolate.  And our family just loves chocolate and hates all that over-the-top sweet and sour stuff.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yeah, never a big fan of the chocolate stuff.  What else did you like?  Those long papers with the little dot candies on it?  No, those were bad.  He probably liked that, and he liked taffy.  And what are those sugar daddies, those awful...  Oh, sugar daddy.  Did you eat Mary Janes?  Those awful peanut butter...  Why are they still making Mary Janes?  Pull your fillings out?  No one likes them. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know who the hell makes those.  The public has spoken.  It's trying to retire Mary Janes.  Yes, and don't forget about E-Rock's costume.  He was a Go-Bot.  We are looking at a picture of him in a Go-Bot costume.  Why would a Go-Bot carry a pumpkin to carry your little treats in?  Why not make it Go-Bot-centric?  I don't know.  I guess whatever was cheapest.  Yeah?  And are you wearing... 
[01:51:30]  It's by the quality costume, though.  Yeah, the costume is...  What is it, paper?  It's like the same material you make those cheap tablecloths out of.  It came in a box for like five bucks.  Yeah.  How old are you?  Those were a lot.  I'm under 10, so probably like seven or eight in that photo.  Well, E-Rock's Halloween costume, when he was younger, will be up on O&A.  Oh, of course.  Back home later today.  Let's get back to this.  So, you know, you got to worry about your kid's fatness during Halloween. 
[01:52:00]  Don't overdo it.  What you want to do is take them to the store and make sure that the snacks you're giving out are healthy ones.  And let them participate in that process of picking things that are going to be good for their friends.  Enough with the news experts.  Yeah, try talking a kid into eating something healthy, especially for Halloween.  Yeah, good luck.  Are you crazy?  It's not what it's about.  Like, they try to take these holidays and just change them into something completely different than it was.  It's about just getting horrid candy and eating it for a day. 
[01:52:30]  And just eating as much as humanly possible, where you do have the bellyache and where you do make the poop castles the next day.  That's kind of disgusting.  So you went thumbs up on that, though.  Of course you did.  Yeah.  Did you have anybody have to go through your bag?  Oh, yeah, my dad.  But my dad was hilarious because he knew that there was no poisoning of the candy.  He knew it was an opportunity to get some really good stuff from us.  Like, okay, no, you don't need this. 
[01:53:00]  He literally would go, oh, you can't eat that, that, that.  It's not wrapped.  And then later on in the night, I'm watching him eat all this stuff he pulled out of our bags.  My father would go through my bag and throw lead paint chips in.  There you go.  All of a sudden, he's in the kitchen with the apple razor blades.  Yes.  The razor blade in the apple has got to be the funniest one ever because who wouldn't notice that there's a razor blade in an apple?  I know.  How are you covering up the skin of the apple after you put the razor in? 
[01:53:30]  It turns all brown in two seconds.  That one always made me laugh.  That and the pins.  Like, you're not going to notice that the skin of the apple has been, like, you know, compromised.  Yeah.  Even as a kid, I was like eight.  I'm like, this is the most ridiculous thing.  No one is putting razor blades in apples.  And if they are, then you're going to know.  So maybe your kids have selective hearing when it comes to their Halloween candy haul.  You want to dump all of the candy out onto the dining room table and sort through it all. 
[01:54:00]  So anything that was handmade by neighbors, which is a very sweet gesture, really, you should get rid of.  All right.  Why should you get rid of it?  Poison.  I got to bring the Culture of Fear book in.  Someone remind me.  Poisonous.  I'll read the chapter on the air.  No one is getting poisoned by candy on Halloween.  The news would like you to think they are, but they're not.  There's been one.  The guy from Culture of Fear went way back and looking through all sorts of records.  And I forgot how many, but he found four or five cases over decades.  And it turned out, I think all of them except one were kids being poisoned by their own family for insurance money. 
[01:54:30]  Now, are they saying not to accept this stuff because, like, somebody else raised food allergies, which is one reason that they don't allow it in schools anymore?  Is that what she's saying?  Or is she being paranoid?  Nah, I think she's paranoid.  Hosebag.  Just scare the crap out of everybody.  Poor old bags are cooking things.  This is a very sweet gesture, really, you should get rid of.  And some alternatives to the sugar.  They can look for some sugar-free candies.  Also, you can look for products that have sweet benefits.  So that's something maybe where something has been added, like vitamin C or calcium. 
[01:55:00]  Also, look for candies that contain natural fruit juices.  I want to put on lead shoes and dropkick her in the throat.  Heavy lead shoes.  Natural fruit juices.  Another news expert that is just filled with nonsense.  This is just nonsense.  If you can get the kids interested in this sort of scavenger hunt in the aisles of the supermarket for something their friends are going to like, then you're creating a pattern in them to actually go looking for that stuff themselves. 
[01:55:30]  Participating in the fun is important to keep kids on a healthy Halloween track.  By the way, it wasn't explained in that clip.  The scavenger hunt in a supermarket is a scavenger hunt looking for healthy stuff.  Healthy stuff.  And that way, when they go out, they'll be more inclined to get the healthy stuff.  No, you won't.  Let's talk to the parents that have eight-year-olds right now.  Take your eight-year-old to a supermarket and say, I want you to run around and find healthy foods. 
[01:56:00]  I want this.  No, I want this.  Shut up.  Yay.  Ma, I found the radishes.  Good boy.  All your friends will love them.  Kids would rather get stool samples dropped in their bags.  Radishes.  Radishes.  Where's the vegetable?  What do you say?  The radish.  I love radishes.  That's why I brought up the bid.  I don't want very good.  I like the radish.  You like a radish? 
[01:56:30]  Sure do.  I steal radishes all the time when I'm in the supermarket.  Like, pluck one off and start chomping away while I'm doing my shopping.  No.  Wipe it on my leg.  That's clean enough, and I get right in there.  I wish they'd all be going to the Joneses, because the Joneses are giving out celery with  peanut butter on them.  People would give that out.  I go with...  Celery.  I go with worse vegetable.  I go with squash.  Yeah.  Brussels sprouts.  I love Brussels sprouts.  I don't mind a good Brussels sprouts.  Do you really like Brussels sprouts?  I can't get enough of them.  Good God.  With lemon juice on it. 
[01:57:00]  They're good, right?  Yeah.  I used to hate...  I used to hate...  Because they hate popcorn.  I used to hate asparagus, and then I just realized that my mom didn't know how to  cook asparagus growing up.  Yeah.  She'd boil the crap out of it to the point it was just this mushy thing on the plate.  And now asparagus is one of my favorite vegetables.  I'm kind of new to the asparagus thing myself.  A little grilled asparagus, amazing.  But as a kid, I would cry if I saw that coming from me.  But Brussels sprouts.  Beats.  I like a Brussels sprout.  You should have grown up in my house with your...  A squash. 
[01:57:30]  ...your awful portions.  It wouldn't give you time to hate the food.  A little sliver of meatloaf.  Here's your portion.  Oh, really?  My mother's awful portions.  Oh, she didn't put out a good portion.  I didn't know our portions sucked so bad.  Portions.  A dollop of little potatoes until somebody came over and goes, that's all?  Oh, what?  You had an honest friend or something?  Yeah.  My mother's meatloaf with the way too red sauce on top.  Oh.  It was like Carrot Top after being just burned.  We had burned Carrot Top head. 
[01:58:00]  It was my meatloaf.  Meatloaf is supposed to be like meatloaf, not like...  I used to hate that red sauce on the top.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  And what was it?  Just a little sliver?  I never knew how stinky the portions were.  Rotten little awful portions.  Here's a portion.  Go about your stomach, Rowley.  I used to wake up with flies on me.  What was the small portions all about?  I don't know.  The Nortons.  Just like the Nortons are a small portion family. 
[01:58:30]  That's funny.  I don't know why.  Your mom looks bird-like.  She eats like a bird.  She's very...  Maybe to her, that was a big meal.  That was a big meal.  Just a little...  Speaking of portions, I read, I think it was yesterday, when you go to a restaurant, what  they give you on average is the equivalent of three portions.  Why?  Because they want to give you a lot of food.  Because the biggest fear if you own a restaurant is having someone walk away hungry, so they  will overfeed you.  And on average, it's the equivalent of three portions. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  That's why so much of it gets thrown into the dumpster or on the street outside this station  to stink in the morning.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Laura in Jersey.  Laura.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  I just want to tell you, my little guys started kindergarten, right, this year, and they send  home all these pamphlets and everything else.  But for their birthday, you can't have cupcakes, you can't send any other, send healthy snacks  and all this crap. 
[01:59:30]  For their birthday, they want you to send in carrot sticks and ranch dressing.  Seriously?  Seriously.  Yeah, I'm learning a little bit about the kid thing because my, you know, my sister and  my brothers, they got kids up at that age.  And some of the stuff that is going on in these schools is just amazing.  What has changed?  We all grew up and our friends, they would have a birthday and their mommy would cook  freaking homemade cupcakes, bring them in.  You had a nice homemade cupcake treat.  And now, if you bring any of that stuff in, it has to be store-bought and it can't be unwrapped. 
[02:00:00]  It has to be sealed.  So what happened?  Was there an epidemic of kids being, you know, killed and poisoned?  No.  We all grew up fine eating this.  But absolutely nothing with peanuts either.  You have to read every ingredient.  Oh, yeah.  Even the brownie box.  Poisoned little bastards.  Sub it out to somebody and they have meat containing peanuts.  So you can't have peanuts.  There's another thing.  When we were growing up, no peanut allergy.  Sorry.  There just wasn't a peanut allergy.  Yeah, I don't know.  We'd have beat up a kid that said he had a peanut allergy.  Shove peanuts on his throat. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Choke him.  Hey, Anthony, can you do me a favor?  What?  Talk about your ex-mother-in-law, please.  No, she's not around anymore.  Yeah, she does.  She does.  What?  She passed.  She passed on.  And she's not around.  Laura's all uncomfortable now.  Oh, sorry.  Did she really die?  No.  Yeah.  I know you don't really care.  She's gone.  Oh, God.  Well, she went home.  She had to circumnavigate her way to heaven by only making right-hand turns. 
[02:01:00]  Because she didn't make left-hand turns, and she realized three rights make a left.  Now, I'm together again with Chester, and he has told me, because in heaven, you can talk  to your pets.  Shut up.  Because it's heaven.  Shut up.  Chester told me that he didn't die of natural causes. 
[02:01:30]  Chester died from a kick to the liver.  Shut up.  A hard kick to the liver, delivered by Greg Opie Hughes.  You can't confirm that.  Chester was very hungry one day, and he partook in a little bit of Opie's dinner. 
[02:02:00]  An entire steak and his potatoes.  Prime rib.  Prime rib.  I mean, if this was...  It was a prime rib.  If this was true, I would be eating prime rib.  And Opie went downstairs to watch the basketball game, and I heard a little yelping from Chester. 
[02:02:30]  And I went, Chester, are you okay down there?  And he came limping up the stairs.  That's not true.  And he was never the same.  I used to have to carry him up to bed.  And then one day, I was told he had a liver cancer, and he died.  But we all know the truth now.  The law told me that Opie had killed my dog.  How did I give your dog liver cancer? 
[02:03:00]  Explain that one.  You kicked my Chester in the liver.  And that caused cancer?  I heard him yelp.  And that caused cancer?  Yes.  It caused something, because he was in an urn for quite a while.  Thank you, Laura.  Thank you very much.  Hey, what's tomorrow's sound for the $1,000?  Ah, what?  You're on.  You're on. 
[02:03:30]  The sound?  Yeah.  Oh, crap.  I gotta get the other template.  Here it is.  This is what you're listening for.  For tomorrow, to win $1,000.  I bring nothing to the table.  We'll play that between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll mop up next.  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous CJ.  Opie and Anthony.  Phones are still lit about the Philly situation.  We'll move on from that in the very near future.  Don't worry.  Once again, to the faithful listeners, thanks for hanging in there today. 
[02:04:00]  Just, uh, it's a major distraction.  What can I tell you?  We got, uh, Dan Gross from the Philadelphia Inquirer on the line here.  Dan.  Yo.  What's going on, buddy?  Not too much.  Uh, sorry to hear about your, uh, your situation down here.  Thank you.  Yeah, we're not happy about it, that's for sure.  Yeah, that's what I was, that's why I called, uh, Steve yesterday.  I was hoping that, you know, if, if you guys were pissed, you would be happy to tell me  so I could have, uh, worked it into my story today.  Okay, so, did that sort of take you off guard? 
[02:04:30]  Uh, we, we had a feeling it was coming, even though no one was talking to us down there  anymore.  I mean, I, I mean, I, hopefully you've been listening to the show, but basically, um,  uh, David, the GM, and, uh, John Cook, the new PD, they came up to New York to tell us  they were going to flip to, uh, back to the, you know, to the rock at YSP, and they wanted  us to be a big part of it, and they were showing us new logos, and they came to New York  just to tell us before they told anybody else, and they were excited to work with us, and 
[02:05:00]  John Cook's like, I'm a big fan, and I'm friends with Tim Sabian, I've heard a lot of great  things about you guys, and I can't wait to work for you, and it was, all right, this  is really cool, we're, we're pumped, and then we went down there a mere few days later, we  broadcasted live, uh, the reaction was amazing, we did our comedy show, there was close to 10,000  people in Camden, and then we signed autographs for two hours, I'm like, wow, really feeling  good about this whole Philly thing, and finally, I think we have a real good chance  to make, uh, the ratings pop in Philly, because we really believed that us anchoring a rock 
[02:05:30]  station could work, and then we go back to New York, and, uh, we never heard from the  guy again, and it's, it's gotta be pointed out that he made it perfectly clear when he  was face-to-face with us, he's like, I'm gonna bother you guys on a daily basis about what's  going on in Philly, so, uh, so, you know, you could bring some of the Philly stuff to your  syndicated radio show, and I'm like, in a good way, he was gonna, yeah, supply us with  information, so we can make, uh, make sure we're on top of the top stories, and this  and that, and I'm like, that's great, that's exactly what we, we look for in a PD, we want 
[02:06:00]  to be in touch with the PDs, and we want them feeding us info, and then it's up to us to  filter it, and try to, you know, make it interesting for the rest of the country, that's what you  do with a syndicated show, and then we come back to New York, and we never hear from the  guy again, and we start bitching, complaining on the air, off the air, I was calling corporate,  I'm like, what the F is going on, why won't this guy, you know, talk to us, and obviously,  uh, they, somewhere between this great meeting in New York, and coming back from our visit,  they, uh, they decided to go in another direction, but they, they weren't men enough to, you know, 
[02:06:30]  let us in on this whole thing.  Yeah, it did seem bizarre, because, you know, it was, I mean, I had reported, I guess, I think  it was September 20th, that this rumor was out there that they were gonna drop you guys  in the fall, or in the spring, and bring, uh, Chris to mornings, but that was, like, just  after you guys left town, and you had the big successful show, and everything.  Yeah.  And Dan, let's be honest, it's not a rumor, you got some really good connections, and  when I saw you print that, I went right to corporate with this, right to corporate.  I was like, what is going on, and why isn't this guy calling us back, and no one- 
[02:07:00]  And they didn't give you a straight answer?  No.  No, absolutely not.  So then we started, obviously, trashing them, going, what is, what is up with this guy,  this John Cook?  And I called him a wussy boy, and, uh, we went off yesterday, and then, uh, they obviously  took us off the air, and then we found out yesterday that, uh, um, you know, that they  were done with us, but the funny thing is, then corporate admitted to me that, uh, well,  they were gonna take you off in 10 to, 10 days to two weeks.  So I kind of beat him to the punch, is, is all.  So do you think you sped it up by calling them names and stuff on air? 
[02:07:30]  Oh yeah, it was told to me.  But what, what's the difference?  Right.  I'm not, you know, what's the difference?  If, if you don't want the show, then why continue, you know, get rid of us immediately?  You know, that's a big insult to us.  I think that's, that's what they did, you know, that's what they did here when, when  I had reported that the station was about to flip, and then basically every host was  starting to worry whether they were gonna get fired, and the station couldn't take, uh,  having to try and lie to everyone, so they just moved it up.  Right.  A couple days ahead of schedule. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, radio secrets don't, uh, last very long, that's for sure.  Not really.  And, and we started trending, uh, you know, better in recent months.  I, I mean, and we're pretty honest with the show, Preston Steve, we're still kicking our  ass, but we, we were showing some, uh, some pretty good improvements.  You know, some of the radio, uh, sites are saying we were absolutely awful in the ratings  in, in Philly.  That's not true.  We, the latest book, we were, uh, fourth men, 18 to 49.  And that's the reason we do this radio show.  You want to be really good with the men.  So we were almost there and, and men, 18 to 34, we were in third place. 
[02:08:30]  That's not the type of show you just, you know, throw out with the morning garbage.  Right.  You just don't.  Well, I think that, you know, I mean, there had been rumors before Chris even came to  town that he was, you know, coming in to be the, uh, the morning guy, you know, once,  uh, once Stern left the air.  And then of course, somebody at CBS decided to go with David Lee Roth, uh, which was obviously  a horrible mistake.  Um, I, I wish him luck, but I think the station is in just an awful, awful place.  And we've had been saying that it's, it's not us now saying it because we're not part 
[02:09:00]  of it.  You know, I, I kind of bitched the corporate about going, look, I'm really concerned about,  you know, YSP and what they're doing down there.  There's a lack of, uh, passion.  And there's, there doesn't seem to be a guy at the helm that really knows what they're  doing.  Well, the weird thing I think is now, you know, Chris is the only actual person, like  the actual host that they have.  And then the rest of the day they're playing like, you know, weird, uh, alternative rock  songs from like 1998.  Like people have heard 7,000 times, but no, great.  Stone Temple Pilots are on.  I'm going to keep this on, you know? 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Well, good luck.  Good luck to you, but I don't, I don't see it happening, you know?  And, and it was told to me yesterday that they've decided to, uh, cancel the Opie and Anthony  show and they're going to roll the dice.  That's what you want to hear, that they don't even have a really good plan in place, but they,  they're willing to roll the dice with something different.  You watch the, the stupid answer he gives you when you talk to them about it too.  He'll go, ah, just, you know, different direction.  You know, he'll just give you some pukey, noncommittal answer.  Yeah, I mean, that's, that's usually what you get from, from radio people.  Well, John Cook is a wussy boy.  And then, uh, now he's claiming that he did try to call me an aunt a few, uh, what, a 
[02:10:00]  couple of weeks ago, and it's just a flat out lie.  Never got, never got a call.  And that's what wussy boys do.  Now they'll just lie to try to save face and, and kind of try to show, you know, people that  you might be a man after all.  Do you, um, do you guys think you're going to try and get something else in Philly or I  guess is that like a CBS deal because you're running out of CBS stations?  No, absolutely.  Uh, I said it earlier this morning because a lot of people thought we went back to commercial  radio, uh, for the money.  And I want to prove that we went back to radio, uh, commercial radio cause we wanted more people 
[02:10:30]  to hear what we do.  And it's, it's not always about the money.  So I, I announced it this morning and I'm going to stick to this.  You can print this.  I will work for free in Philly to prove that I'm doing it for, for the, for the passion  of the whole thing.  I don't, I don't need money to be heard in Philly.  I will work for another station for free.  That's how much I believe in this show and how much I believe in the Philly market.  And I don't want any, you know, uh, any, uh, uh, owner down there going, uh, I kind of 
[02:11:00]  like these guys, but they're a little bit expensive for my taste.  So let's get that right out of the way.  My salary free, free.  So any, any Philly station that wants you guys can call today and you'll, you'll entertain  the notion of working for them for nothing.  I Opie say today that I will work for free on the, uh, uh, uh, on the Philly airway.  I'll do it for like 10 bucks.  Yes.  How about Norton?  How much does he want?  Uh, I, I, I take what the remainder of their salaries and I add it to mine and I divvy it 
[02:11:30]  up as I see fit.  I 10 bucks.  Anthony's just taking what I already make.  I want to, I will work for free to prove a point that I'm doing it.  Cause I really believe in the show.  I believe in, uh, Philadelphia and I, I want to make it work and I want to, I want to show,  uh, Philly that we can be, you know, Preston and Steve, if we have the right people behind  us, pushing the show.  Absolutely.  Cool.  Well, hopefully somebody will take you up on this.  There you go.  All right, Dan.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  Thanks.  Take it easy, man.  Later on.  Dan Gross from the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Tomorrow we won't talk about this as much.  I promise.  Thanks for hanging in there today.  Yeah.  Hello, Phil.  Oh.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:12:30]  Opie and Anthony.  And here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  Rainy day in New York City.  It's not going away.  What's wrong?  Jimmy, you blasted one right before showtime.  I did when I walked in the door.  I didn't mean to.  I was just trying to get in on time.  And sometimes, like when I run really fast, my insides cramp up and it propels me forward. 
[02:13:00]  I hate being late.  You're jet propelled.  Yeah.  Did you notice how I zipped in here?  You're just pushing out some fear.  Oh, thank you.  I just need this now.  You smell bad in here now.  No, it'll smell great.  I honestly don't smell it at all.  Dude, it must have went directly up my nostrils then.  Because it was horrific.  All right. 
[02:13:30]  We got Arlie Ermey calling in at 10 o'clock.  Arlie Ermey.  What's he promoting?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's a good cause.  I have no fucking clue.  He works with the boys.  Top 25 most influential talk radio hosts.  Influential.  Oh, we actually made the list.  Did we? 
[02:14:00]  For what?  We're not influencing anyone in Philly, but as far as America goes, we do all right.  15th place out of 25.  Russell Limbaugh is in first.  O'Reilly second.  I'm his third.  He doesn't even have a show.  Yeah.  Howard beat us on this survey.  13th place.  We're in 15th.  We're beating out such unbelievable talk show hosts as Randy Rhoads, G. Gordon Liddy, Larry Elder, Michael Reagan, and Tom Lakers. 
[02:14:30]  I heard some more of that fucking phony-voiced idiot when I was in L.A.  Yeah.  I just can't believe he talks like that.  I don't get it.  Bob from a car phone.  Why don't you leave her?  Why do I talk like this?  I don't know.  Likas 100.  Come on.  He knows everything about women.  With his stupid members-only jacket. 
[02:15:00]  And his sunglasses.  I have...  Oh, and one of the...  It's funny.  We talked about Penn and Teller today.  I have a Bullshit, which was a good show that those guys do.  And in it, they have...  I forget what the talk radio segment is, but they have Tom Likas.  And they have him talking, regular.  And then you see him on the air, and it's so funny.  He's such a stiff cunt.  He's standing there with his arms down, and he's like, with his sunglasses, like,  look it up, just talking.  This is the way it is, people.  You get fat, and you hit your wife with a yule lock. 
[02:15:30]  Allegedly.  Ah, it's just his opinion.  Yeah.  I know, I'm just...  Whatever.  There was a...  Yeah, I don't know.  I remember a police report.  Fuck him.  It's not domestic violence as long as you sing Silent Night while you're beating her.  You fucking fat cunt.  Shut up.  By the way, it's got to be pointed out.  Hood E from Philly.  Jimmy's bear rant just made me cry laughing.  One of the funniest rants ever on the show.  We were just sitting here before the show listening to it, and we were fucking laughing. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  That is so funny how you just wanted to burn the bear and push him over.  I actually enjoyed that one myself.  It's really weird.  Like, I don't mind listening to animal rants like this.  I don't mind listening to myself, but I will admit I did enjoy that one.  The animal rant.  And my favorite part of it was how you described the burnt bear's ears as veiny Doritos.  Poor little burnt bear ears. 
[02:16:30]  You could just crack it off like a Dorito.  Fuck him.  You're all pink and sore.  Have to give him some vinegar earmuffs.  Here you go, shit dick.  Fucking give him an orange hunter's hat.  Keep yourself warm with these in the winter.  He'll feel so silly wearing the hat of the enemy.  He'll feel dumb.  Wow.  Make all staff exercise for an hour, says top health advisor. 
[02:17:00]  What?  What is this?  It's like communist China?  A radical plan to improve the nation's health, including a workplace exercise hour, has been  unveiled by a leading government advisor.  Could you imagine?  That's like, I think they're taking that from Japan.  I'm talking to the people in the workplace right now.  Could you imagine that you have to like exercise for an hour during work hours?  An hour?  New figures today show England is the fattest country in the EU. 
[02:17:30]  We're called the US.  They're called the EU.  Now, Professor Julian Legrand, chairman of Health England, hopes to encourage people to improve  their diets, give up smoking, and exercise more.  Oh, so this is a story that's from across the pond.  It's an England story.  Who gives a shit?  I hate England stories.  Why?  They're just, I don't think they're real, ever.  Like, I think England exaggerates their news more than even we do.  Well, their tabloids are worse than ours.  The mirror and whatever else. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the mirror.  They have some nude chick in their paper.  You open up, you're three pages in, and there's some completely naked English broad with fucking  fence post teeth.  A big hairy English bush like the woman that got out of the tub in The Shining.  Before she turned into the old broad.  Just awful stories.  Diana's clit was seen vacationing with Dodie's surviving fucking lobe.  Give us a fuck.  Who cares about England? 
[02:18:30]  And in other news, this is a new segment we're trying out.  All the stuff we didn't get to, it's called.  Because some of this stuff is really good, usually.  It's called O&A's Leftovers.  Leftovers.  Backseat toilet to end mishaps and traffic jams.  Ah.  Now here's something we can use.  If you're stuck in traffic when Mother Nature calls, of course it's Japan.  Of course it is.  It's Japan's Kaneko Sengaiwaka company has developed a loo for you.  The manufacturer of plastic car accessories drew back the curtain on Tuesday on its new portable 
[02:19:00]  toilet for cars.  What the fuck?  The toilet comes with a curtain large enough to conceal users and plastic bag to collect  waste.  Yuck.  The plastic bag is actually a woman in a fucking bridal outfit and it comes with a video  camera to put it up on YouTube when you're finished.  Lovely culture.  The commode will come in handy during major disasters such as earthquakes or when you  are caught in a traffic jam.  If you're caught in an earthquake, who gives a shit where you shit? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You have bigger problems on your hand.  Exactly.  You probably fall off the ball anyway with the whole planet rumbling.  Shit all over your front seat.  And here is some audio of someone actually using the toilet.  Or not.  Or, uh, there we go.  That should have been on.  You know the Japanese will probably use that in one of their game shows. 
[02:20:00]  Some host, some smarmy Japanese host will come over with a microphone and will quiet.  And then rip the door open while someone's taking a dump.  He'll laugh.  They're just cruel to each other.  And in the funny toilet, they put like a fucking M80.  He's going to blow some guy's fucking smooth hairless bag off.  His fucking balls are on the headliner of the car. 
[02:20:30]  And they're just laughing at him.  Those Japanese don't care what they do to each other.  His fucking groin.  It looks like a mouth that's been hit with a baseball bat.  It's just a big bloody gaping fucking area.  And little balls have been blown off.  They're just hitting.  They're just stuck to the fucking headliner.  Like Tyson gave him an uppercut.  And the guy's like writhing in pain holding his balls.  But when he sees the hidden camera, he's like, oh.  And he laughs. 
[02:21:00]  He laughs.  Who's...  Who's...  Who's...  Who's...  Who's...  Who's...  Jesus.  No 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Most of all of you are  No songs  what's he doing to the guy you want to know yes all right japanese man tries to learn english 
[02:22:00]  while classroom full of other japanese people try to remain quiet if they laugh they are  gained on their asses they are sick what the is it a game show i don't even know how they get away with  this yeah yeah it's so funny how about this nation how about this one 
[02:22:30]  i know what that is i i can't get enough of this man the more you can find any the better for the  show dude that one was violent what was that what do you think that was i actually know what that was  all right jimmy that was uh there was a pregnant woman in a sushi restaurant and she ordered a 
[02:23:00]  california roll so instead they had a ram come out and hit her in the stomach with his horns  you are correct  it's called stew the tomato 
[02:23:30]  okay i gotta know what the fuck that was women stare at a huge magic eye on a wall right you  know those magic eye yeah books and posters well picture a whole wall that just looks like a magic  eye oh and there are these maybe four or five women uh and they're staring at it trying to see the  pattern turn into something when  when a guy dressed in a spandex suit with the magic eye pattern on the spandex suit jumps out of the 
[02:24:00]  obviously false wall and scares the shit out of these japanese women and one of them the one that  screams is actually screaming as she's passing out and she's just out on the floor and that's why they  play the little ambulance  the first time i saw that i think me and thad watched it probably 50 times it was just too funny  the best part is they went through the trouble of making his outfit match the wall he was jumping  through but like it's just scary to have a guy jump yeah he could have been in a suit but the 
[02:24:30]  thousandth of a second where they realize it matches the wall he's coming out of is completely  irrelevant but they took the time to make sure he matched the wall he was jumping out of  um i i just don't get them yeah they're great some some dude in syracuse if you caught an earthquake  you don't need a toilet you need new underwear good point and then someone's trying to guess the sound  well kevin from connecticut a faithful listener he writes that was a japanese radio show angry about  losing the kobe affiliate 
[02:25:00]  we have one more today  holy shit jason c from georgia wow the stupidest you get the the you get the award of being the  stupidest listener today wow good good for you jason c from georgia he writes fuck do a tv show 
[02:25:30]  already and then he continues he goes this is why you're not on in philly barely describing anything  the whole bit is not to describe this you idiot let your imagination run wild and then then you  tell everybody what it is oh my god you're an idiot you are the stupidest listener today  october 24 2007 you get the title what's the name jason c from georgia congrats a dummy 
[02:26:00]  time  it  is  Oh my god, that is so annoying. 
[02:26:30]  How long does this go on?  How long are you?  Oh my god.  Sounds like people's shadows being burnt into a building wall. 
[02:27:00]  Exactly.  Who the fuck is it?  Almost over.  It's probably a guy with a Godzilla costume just walking into a place.  Freaking out.  See, the clip has to be that long, because when you find out what it is, it just makes  it that much better.  Ah, I've seen this video, by the way. 
[02:27:30]  This is probably one of the only ones I've ever seen as far as these Japanese game shows  go.  As far as I'm concerned, this is probably one of the best ones I've ever seen, as far  as creativity goes.  Yeah.  It's the best.  I mean, you want me to...  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, please.  It's...  Picture a platform, a raised platform with holes in it.  And around...  There's like a fiberglass wall that surrounds the entire thing.  Mm-hmm.  And through these holes on this bottom platform, Japanese girls poke their heads through, wearing  like meat headbands.  They look like steak doctors. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, like surgeons, but instead of that metal thing, it's like a piece of steak, right?  And then they let what I can only describe as a Komodo dragon loose.  And the Japanese woman, the last Japanese woman to leave her head in this cage wins.  Because the minute this Komodo dragon starts running for them, they all, you know, duck out  of the way.  They freak out.  Yeah.  Whoa, yeah, I got to see that one, too.  It's fantastic.  It's like...  It's the best thing ever. 
[02:28:30]  Where...  Where did they...  I don't know where they even take this up.  We'll have a...  Komodo dragon.  Meat hat.  Women.  A meat headband.  Who pitches these in fucking front of executives?  And they say yes.  Yeah.  Which ones didn't they take?  Exactly.  Well, one guy said they lay on their back with meat and they're cunts and they can't run.  And the fucking...  The winner is the last one.  The Komodo dragon actually pops his head through her stomach. 
[02:29:00]  She's the winner.  Too...  Take too long.  They all laugh.  Yeah.  Other shit we didn't get to on the first half of the show.  We actually had this story.  We got an update on the man who was 24 and he married a broad that was 82.  Remember this story?  From a couple weeks ago?  Yep.  A 24-year-old man married an 82-year-old woman.  Well, the Argentine woman, she died. 
[02:29:30]  Oh.  Already.  It's only been a few weeks.  She died as a result of heart problems.  Well, he was probably...  I think he...  Tagging her.  He fucked her to death, basically.  What a way to go out.  Her last words were, no one ever put it in there.  She fucking grabbed her chest and collapsed onto the fucking rug with a doily in her hand  and shit all over his dick as it popped out uneventfully.  Fucking awful.  Her asshole probably stuck to his dick.  Like, I bet you when she fell, there was like a pink sock slinky. 
[02:30:00]  She's dead on the floor and his dick is attached.  Her asshole would not let go.  It looked like a giant pink earthworm.  But it was really her asshole skin.  And she fucking...  She died with a doily in her hand.  She just grabbed the first thing she could find.  It was a doily.  It looked like one of the graboids from Travers.  Travers.  Yeah.  Wow.  Pinks. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, she never thought it would hurt that good.  Oh.  How funny is that?  He's got to pull his shitty dick out of her corpse.  It was just...  I know.  But as she fell and died, he was coming and you could see it gurgling down the pink sock  pipe.  It looked like a long snake eating a fucking rat or a mouse. 
[02:31:00]  82 years young.  They were married September 28th and their honeymoon was in Brazil.  And shortly after their return from their honeymoon, she died of heart problems.  Wow.  And was she wealthy?  Is this why this guy married her?  No.  Their love is said to have blossomed when this dude went to live with his future bride after  his mother's death when he was 15.  Oh, I see.  So he was a mama's boy.  His mom dies.  Yeah.  So he goes to live with her. 
[02:31:30]  And that was when he was 15.  Amir, what, nine years later, he marries the broad.  Yeah.  Something was going on then when he was...  Of course.  iPhone mystery.  We already explained this.  1.4 million sold.  250,000 never activated.  Yeah.  That's like people waiting for contracts to end and gifts.  I don't know what that means.  That they probably didn't want.  Wild elephants electrocuted in India after drinking rice beer.  Who cares?  Oh, this is a good one.  The driver stopped for having too many air fresheners. 
[02:32:00]  A man reportedly stopped by Frederick County Sheriff's deputies for having too many air  fresheners on his rear view mirror says he suspects the real reason he is that...  What?  He suspects the real reason he is that he is Hispanic.  That's how it's written.  Oh, stop it.  And it's AP copy.  So he thinks he got pulled over because he's Hispanic and not because he had too many air  fresheners.  Don't pull you over if you have too much shit hanging from that rear view mirror.  They're obstructing your view. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  And they're just saying, you know, he's saying they found an excuse to stop him and check  his immigration status.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Well, if that's the case, so be it.  Was he legal?  I don't know.  Who gives a shit?  I had a roach clip with a feather on it, man.  And I hung it from my rear view.  And then going into like Sunken Meadow State Park one day, going through the toll, and this  prick just like waves me over and starts giving me shit.  I can write you up for that. 
[02:33:00]  That's obstructing a view.  For a roach clip hanging?  Yeah.  It's like, you know, a little roach clip thing.  And then there was a big blue feather hanging from it.  Right.  Man.  Wow.  Like the earrings the chicks used to wear in the 80s.  Jesus.  Big feather earrings.  And then, yeah, he gave me all kinds of shit.  And I was with a girl at the time, so it was just like embarrassing.  Mm-hmm.  Can't tell him to go fuck himself because he's got a gun.  I actually have a black light poster hanging from my car window. 
[02:33:30]  It's a really cool, like, dragon snake.  I put a little black light on my car.  Girls love it.  They think I'm the keenest.  Seats glow in the dark with your jizz under the black light.  It's funny.  Yeah, you can see where every load was shot.  Ninety percent of them are fucking in my own area.  On the headrest.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:34:00]  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too.  Here comes the world's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects and  A few lines that don't make no sense and  Hope an ant will be so proud of me.  Hey, epic guy.  I've missed the point completely  I should kill myself discreetly 
[02:34:30]  This jingle was around my seas, I know  My life's been kind of rough  And eighteen years is long enough  My dad should have hopped the gun away  Yay!  I got  Nothing  They're all coming over  That's what I heard  Shit  I heard everybody is going over  Everybody?  They're all going to be there 
[02:35:00]  Are we going over there or are they coming over here?  No, everyone's going there  There?  Yeah  Everybody  Like when I say every  Like everybody  Is going there  How is that possible?  How are they going to fit it all?  I don't know  Don't know  That's what I'm hearing  That's not my problem  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio  I want to say hi to everyone that showed up today 
[02:35:30]  A nice little crowd on the bleachers on this fine rainy day  What's up, buddy?  Buddy boys and girlies  There's four guys and two lovely gals  And one of the guys who had a great idea  He had a YSP shirt  And he goes  Do you want to take a shit on this?  I really do  Because I haven't shit in like a day and a half  And it would be a fucking lava smoothie shit  A masterpiece

I said, I'm doing something  We got Arlie Ermey on the phone  Oh, nice  You gotta cut your segment short  I'm sorry, Renee  And she's right in the middle of a story  And she's right in front of us  Awkward 
[02:46:30]  Thank you, Renee  One of the greatest movie characters ever  Is calling in right now  Yes  You got it  Thank you, Renee  We'll talk to you a little later  After we're done with one of the greatest film characters ever  Arlie Ermey  Good morning, girls  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show, sir  It's always a pleasure  Last time you were here  We went deep with you, sir  Talking about your upbringing and everything  Well, you know 
[02:47:00]  Everybody's got a background  Everybody's got a history, right?  So I don't have anything to hide  Do you get sick of Full Metal Jacket  Like people questioning you on that  Or like we did other stuff  Like Mississippi Burning  Do you kind of wish people would concentrate on the other stuff you've done, too?  Well, it just seems  And there's no question about it  Full Metal Jacket lives on  The damn film just keeps going  It never stops  It just  It seems like it gets more popular 
[02:47:30]  It's got ups and downs  You know  It's not a day goes by  But what I don't sign a couple of coffees  A Full Metal Jacket  Warner Brothers told me  It sold more film than any  Sold more DVDs and videos  Than any film they've ever done  Wow  So it's like  It's a ritualistic film  Passed from father to son  We had  Matthew Modine was in  And he was saying that  We didn't even know  You had a car accident or something 
[02:48:00]  As the filming of that was being done  Right in the middle  Right in the middle of the  The shooting of Full Metal Jacket  I  I  Hit some black ice  In Epping Forest  Coming down a winding road  In Epping Forest  And  Slept off the road  Took out a  Took out a  A black walnut tree  On the way  And ended up in the middle of a golf course  That totaled the car out  And  Broke six ribs  A collarbone 
[02:48:30]  Dislocated my hip  And  Let's see what  I guess that's about it  Oh well  It dislocated my shoulder  My right shoulder as well  And you were still able to  Get in there and  Do the movie  It took me two months  I was on the mend for two months  And the first scene that we did  When we came back from  When we came back to  To shoot  Was the  Obstacle course scene 
[02:49:00]  Oh  Beautiful  And the first damn day  That I was back  Guess what  Vince the owner  Frio  Pulled a hamstring  Oh  And we were off  Another god damn week  And the  And the actors  Were going  Out of their minds  They all wanted to go home  You know  They're young guys  They like to be home  So  Had a major mutiny  On our hands  Stanley and I  Wow  But it worked out okay  And everybody was happy 
[02:49:30]  With the product  And  And seeing it was  Certainly worthwhile  Hey guys  The good folks  At the History Channel  Came  Came to me  With a project  Good idea  Here  Earlier this year  I want to talk about it  Okay  It's  Take a vet to school day  Yeah  Take a veteran to school  It's going to be on the History Channel  Right  Well  It's not a show  It's not a program  It is a  It is a program  That we're offering 
[02:50:00]  To the schools  And  About 200 schools  Are signed up so far  To take a vet  To school day  And all it  Simply entails  Is  Taking a veteran  Asking a veteran  To come to your classroom  And talk to the kids  Tell them his stories  I've had  I was a bit skeptical  When they first came to me  With the idea  And so I went up to Las Vegas  And I got the  The third graders 
[02:50:30]  In Las Vegas together  And I  And I gave them  A little talk  And I was happy  To find out  By the way  That  About 30% of them  Were big fans  Of Mail Call  And  And most of the rest  Of them  Knew me  From shows like  Toy Stories  And the Simpsons  And  Family Guy  And things like that  This take a veteran  To school program  Didn't work very well  With Charles Whitman  Well  Charles  Had a little bit  Of a hang up there 
[02:51:00]  From that book  Suppository building sir  Charles  Insisted on bringing  His fucking rifle  He certainly did  Some of them  Just can't get there  Without their rifle  They just gotta have  Their rifle  Outstanding  Our veterans  Will not bring  Their rifle  No  No  These are level headed  Very intelligent veterans  Anyway  I talked to the kids  In the third grade  Up at Las Vegas  And then after  I finished my little spiel  I opened it up 
[02:51:30]  For questions  And I was expecting  A sprinkling of hands  When I asked for questions  But  Almost every hand  In the auditorium  Went up  So  They were very  Enthusiastic about it  I had one kid  That asked me a question  About  His uncle  Had been in Somalia  Could I explain  That to him  Another kid  Well  A bunch of kids  Actually asked questions  About Vietnam  How come people 
[02:52:00]  Spit on the  Veterans  And the soldiers  When they came back  From Vietnam  How come the war  Was so unpopular  I was able to  Explain to them  That the media  Was doing exactly  What they  The communist  Liberal media  Was doing exactly  What they were doing  Now  And they were  Lying to the  American people  And they had  The American people  Convinced that we  Were losing 
[02:52:30]  The war in Vietnam  That we were losing  We were sending  Young men over  To die  For no reason  For no good reason  And the liberal  Media by the way  Is doing that  Again right now  But anyway  These veterans  Are falling  By the wayside  Boys  And we're losing  World war 2 veterans  And Korean veterans  By the droves now  And we need  They've gone  Taking good  Great stories  To the graves  With them  So why not  For show and tell 
[02:53:00]  Take a vet to school  That's a pretty cool  Idea  I like it  It works  Opie and Anthony  It works for the  Vets too  It makes them  Feel better  Of course  It makes them  Feel needed  You know  They get to air  Their feelings  But anyway  It works both ways  It's a good program  Arlie I got a question  For you  Off the subject  Which we will  Absolutely  I just reading  Something here  And it's very  Interesting to me  And I didn't know it  It said you did  Study drama  At the University  Of Manila  In the Philippines  And it said  That Coppola  Cast you in  Apocalypse Now 
[02:53:30]  While filming in the area  Yeah  Yeah  What did you do  In Apocalypse Now  I was a helicopter pilot  I did not  Fucking know that  That's because  I'm young and handsome  Back in the day  But you're actually  That's why  I had jet black hair  I was built  Like a stud  What scene are you in  Are you in  When they're playing  Shall we dance  Is that this  I was a helicopter pilot  While they  Were  Duvall was talking 
[02:54:00]  About jolly  Don't surf  Right  It was  I  My chopper  And I  Flew in  And blew up  A bridge  Where there was  A car crossing  Bridge  I remember that  Yeah  So anyway  And it was also  Assistant technical  Advisor of the show  Yeah  Oh my god  So I was  Involved with  That show  Apocalypse Now  Is not one  That I'm very proud of  Because  Every Vietnam  Veteran in the world 
[02:54:30]  Hates  The Apocalypse Now  Because  It made us look like  A bunch of  Real nitwits  To the dopers  And  Yeah  Druggies  And idiots  You know  However  I was there  And I did need  A paycheck  And so I was  On board  I love  I love Mail Call  It's a great show  We're changing  That around  We're  The history channel  There again  Came to me  About last

[02:56:00]  And running over  The watermelons  I think  Yeah that was  That was fun  They actually  They actually  Set the watermelons  Up the first time  And I actually  Made it all the way  Through the obstacle  Course of watermelons  Without breaking any  And so the next  Trip around  My director  Producer  Rob Lahani  My director  Producer and friend  Rob Lahani  Said  That wasn't very  Interesting  Gunny  Why don't you  Run over them 
[02:56:30]  And I said  Well shit  Okay  That's what I'll do  And that time  When I came through  I maneuvered  To the point  Where I ran over  About half of them  I think  Then I ran through  A stack of straw  Yeah  It was an interesting day  That was one of our  Geez  That was one of our  Very first shows  You've been watching  For quite a while  Oh for a long time  About five years ago  Watch you drive that jeep  Across that lake  With the tarp  Oh yeah
