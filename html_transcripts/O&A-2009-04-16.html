<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the FEMA website, Whoopi Goldberg's hypocrisy regarding flying (fearing it but using private jets), and John Madden's aversion to flying and questionable diet.  Joe DeRosa filled in for Anthony, who was attending his grandmother's funeral.  DeRosa participated in a sound effects game, and the show heavily featured discussion of Susan Boyle's "Britain's Got Talent" appearance, with much crude commentary on her looks.  Numerous anecdotes about Bob Kelly's volatile personality were shared. The hosts then debated United Airlines' proposed policy of charging heavier passengers more, transitioning into a discussion about obesity and the annoyance of crying babies on airplanes, marked by extreme and provocative statements.  Darkly humorous anecdotes about funeral experiences, including awkward moments and mishaps during burials, were recounted by the hosts and guests.  Listener calls further fueled conversations about Susan Boyle and funeral experiences, including one caller describing lights going out during a body viewing and another detailing a casket collapse requiring a second funeral.

The show continued with discussions of Mark Fidrich's death and the practices of exhuming bodies, including listener accounts of unusual funeral situations like a deceased person's legs being amputated to fit a coffin, and the use of donated bodies in science (car crash tests and makeup experiments). Opie, Anthony, and Joe DeRosa engaged in a humorous exchange about Twitter and an unflattering picture of DeRosa posted by Bobby Kelly.  Jim Norton's views on death and atheism were briefly mentioned, along with the upcoming arrival of the new Cardinal of New York, with explicit instructions to avoid any "shenanigans." A George Carlin bit on golf courses was played, followed by Keith Robinson joining the broadcast, expressing his annoyance at the earlier conversation between Opie and DeRosa about comedians, leading to a heated debate about Richard Pryor's comedic style between Keith and Joe.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion about the Catholic Church's stance on homosexuality and gay marriage, sparked by a blurry photo of a potential future Pope, touching upon the age of Popes and the Church's evolving views.  This segued into a debate on alternative comedy between the hosts and Keith Robinson, further fueled by Robinson's brother being a bishop.  An anecdote about Robinson's brother's car accident and subsequent Tai Chi practice was shared. Jamie Foxx's apology for controversial remarks about Miley Cyrus was discussed, contrasting his motivations (an upcoming movie) with Opie and Anthony's approach to edgy humor. A listener email highlighted the media's role in amplifying such controversies, potentially harming children.

Bill Donahue, a conservative activist, joined the show, discussing his successful campaign against Miller Brewing Company and engaging in a lengthy debate on gay marriage, arguing from a perspective rooted in natural law. The hosts and other guests challenged Donahue’s views, touching upon civil unions, adoption rights, and conflicts between religious institutions and government policies.  The discussion included tangents on female genital mutilation, incest, child marriage, bestiality, and the views of various public figures. The debate ultimately concluded without resolution.

A later segment focused on the Old and New Testaments, the Catholic Church's interpretation of biblical texts, and contemporary issues like same-sex marriage and the handling of child sexual abuse scandals.  Bill Donahue participated as a phone guest, along with Opie, Jim Norton, and Joe DeRosa in-studio.  The discussion included disagreements about the Church's rejection of the Old Testament, the New Testament's stance on marriage, the Bible's creation process, and the Church's handling of child sexual abuse.  The film "Angels & Demons" and its portrayal of the Catholic Church was critiqued. A caller, Andrew from Brooklyn, joined the debate on same-sex marriage, expressing conservative views.  The segment concluded with comedic anecdotes, including a story about a man ejected from Yankee Stadium and a doctor's discovery of a tree in a patient's lung, along with a discussion about Woody Allen's lawsuit against American Apparel.

The final segment centered on listener calls about incessant telemarketing calls about car warranties,  with callers sharing unsuccessful strategies for stopping them and one successful tactic: claiming the person is deceased.  The conversation then expanded to other annoying scams.  The show included many tangents: a story about a man exposing himself at a gas station, the Octomom trademarking her name, the hosts’ experiences with tax issues and telemarketers, a deep dive into a repetitive children's song, and a discussion of Joe DeRosa's appearance, his gigs, and a physical altercation with his son.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of John Madden's unexpected retirement.

[00:03:30]  www.fema.org  www.fema.org  www.fema.org 
[00:04:00]  www.fema.org  www.fema.org  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Now you can look a little better.  Exactly. So I have a blindfold I hand and go and she comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show is the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  www.fema.org  www.fema.org  www.fema.org  www.fema.org  I'm just looking at page six and it says Whoopi takes to the air.  And it's Whoopi Goldberg.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  They taped the view in LA and she had to take a bus back and forth to LA because she's so afraid to fly.  Like I had a fear of flying for many years and I can't, I just can't comprehend still being that afraid of it that you take a bus to Los Angeles.  I'm afraid to fly but not so afraid to fly to take a bus from New York to LA.  Yeah.  That's when my fear goes away.  Yeah.  I mean maybe I will drive to Buffalo or Rochester to see Brother Weez because you can do that. 
[00:05:30]  But a bus all the way to LA because you're afraid to fly? Nah.  That makes sense.  John Madden's like that.  On the NFL he will not fly.  He will take a bus everywhere.  You know what?  John Madden should be afraid of his diet because he lives in our neighborhood.  Yeah.  Or used to.  I haven't seen him in the last year or two.  And that guy walks in and out of these restaurants eating the most greasy crap.  He should be worried about his heart.  And stop this, you know, fear of flying thing.  It's always odd to me that people like, when you have a phobia, like for years I was like, I can't fly. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  I'll never be, my career is going to get injured because I can't, I can't get on a plane.  And now you start doing it and you're like, what the fuck was I scared of?  Yeah.  Like I was in LA recently, I'm like, I wasn't scared once or maybe for five minutes during the six hour flight.  And to be that afraid where you got to get on a bus and travel for two and a half days.  Jesus, Whoopi.  What's a two and a half days?  That's what cross country takes.  I mean, nonstop.  They probably have drivers.  Yeah.  That, that.  Enough with the music.  Jesus.  We get it. 
[00:06:30]  We're outrageous.  Jesus.  Let's start our broadcast.  Very important stuff.  I know.  I'm starting off like a fucking gossip girl.  Did you hear that Whoopi won't fly?  But, uh, yeah, she will not, uh, play.  I don't, she flew to London now.  She's like, she took a private plane to London, uh, to see something or some musical of, of  sister act.  Yeah.  As they said are the ones that go down.  Well, she, I guess.  I mean, look at the track record on those things lately. 
[00:07:00]  But how, how could a, how could a 52 hour bus ride seem feasibly safer in your head than  a three hour flight or four hour flight?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, and the famous, it's more dangerous to drive than fly.  You know, many opportunities for that bus to careen off a cliff or something.  Dude, it's, it's, it's the illusion of control.  Right.  You could always say, stop, I want to get off.  Like, with a plane, you're just helpless.  But with a bus, you can technically go stop.  It's just, let's just stop this.  And, uh, she flew private. 
[00:07:30]  But the thing was, she had a doctor with her.  They said armed with sedatives in case she panicked.  That's the advantage of being an Oscar winner.  You know, you can fucking get away with that.  You can get Club Soda Kenny to do that for you, Jimmy.  Yeah, just talk to me.  Just talk to me.  It's time for your sedative, Mr. Norton.  I, I, I hope it was a local bus.  It should have stopped like fucking six times before she got to Pennsylvania.  Right.  Yeah, was it a Capitol Trailway?  A Peter Pan fucking eight-dollar round trip. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, man.  We got to welcome Joe DeRosa to the show today.  Thank you for having me, man.  And before, you know, it gets back to Anthony.  Anthony's out today.  His, uh, his, his grandma died.  Yeah.  And he's at a funeral today.  Uh, Joe is sitting in Anthony's seat.  Yes.  He just has to.  This place is too small.  It's better because for a triangle to work, it's just easier to look at Joe on the left  and you there.  Yeah.  Than to look at Joe to the right.  It's just, there's no reason for Anthony's seat to be empty.  This place is panicking because tomorrow we got Doug Stanhope, uh, Kevin Smith and somebody 
[00:08:30]  else.  And we don't know where to put all these guys.  So I think they're going to set up microphones in front of those little couches we have in  here.  You put one, we could probably put two guys at the counter here.  Yeah.  It is, uh, between where Anthony and I normally sit and in between where Danny and I are.  You could probably get two guys.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  It's going to be kind of fucking creepy and homoerotic.  God forbid one of them has tits.  There's fucking six more dudes in here.  A bunch of fags.  Well, I won't touch any of these buttons he has over here.  No, you can. 
[00:09:00]  You can.  Yeah, touch one of the buttons.  He has mine.  Can I just touch one?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Uh-huh.  It's not plugged in.  Why isn't it plugged in?  I don't know.  I guess it's not turned on.  Dude, I've been asking for one of those machines for six years.  I can't have one.  What's the one that goes, you're going to be okay?  I want to put it.  There's different banks.  Look at the templates.  Oh, boy.  You're not going to be able to figure that out in one sitting, Joe.  I'll just punch one of these.  Yeah, just hit any button to try it.  Just push a random one.  Ready?  No, no, no.  It's still booting up. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  It's got to boot up.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Well, once it's booted up, I'm going to press the one that's...  I'm looking at the stuff we're going to cover today.  Doctors find tree growing in Russian man's lung?  Ew.  What?  Yep.  All right.  We'll get to that a little later.  Was it growing or did he swallow it?  I don't know what happened.  I saw that in the...  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  Well...  Oh, shit.  Hey!  Perfect.  You're one for one.  Joe DeRosa is one for one. 
[00:10:00]  That's the game we're going to play today.  How many...  Just take a chance and randomly hit a button when you feel like something needs to be accented.  Okay.  Okay.  And you're one for one so far.  All right.  All right.  But I'm only going to stick in bank one here.  I can't get into switching these fucking...  Well, if you need another bank, just let Danny know.  Raise your hand and he'll just give you another bank.  Yes.  Raise your hand and scream bank switch.  Yeah.  Danny will run over.  Danny, bank!  He sure will.  All right.  We could start with this Susan Boyle thing just because Joe DeRosa hasn't...  He doesn't know about Susan Boyle. 
[00:10:30]  The international sensation.  Yeah.  I'm excited.  Actually, Jimmy brought this to our attention.  I just saw...  I've been out of touch the last few days as far as the news and stuff goes and Jimmy's  like, we got to talk about this broad.  I only saw her because of one of our many monitors.  I saw this...  Obviously, the thing is she's ugly.  She's really fucking homely.  And she was making a big splash on Britain's Got Talent, the America's Got Talent of England.  Why do I have to explain that?  She gets what it is.  And I'm like, oh, she probably is a good singer. 
[00:11:00]  And she was.  But everybody's talking about her.  But she's just an ugly woman who's a good singer.  She looks like Bobby Kelly with a wig on.  You know, it's funny.  They talked about her on Red Eye last night.  I really did think of Bob Kelly.  I'm like, she looks like Bob Kelly.  But I didn't say that because...  Yeah.  Who knows Bob Kelly?  Oh, a few of us don't.  Why did I say that?  He's my friend.  I was going to say the same thing.  You know what, dude?  I don't need that out there, dude.  Bob is so weird.  Bob is really playful.  And once in a while, you'll hit a nerve. 
[00:11:30]  He's like, you know what, dude?  Fuck you.  I don't...  What the fuck?  All right, Bob.  Sorry.  Jesus.  That happened.  He could snap on a dime, that guy.  Bob snaps immediately.  He got...  One of the dumbest things, too.  I'm sorry.  No, go, Joe.  He'll get a little bit of an internal fucking hurt sometimes.  I was at his house the other week, and we were...  He was fucking with me the whole time I was there.  And he's going, look at your fucking posture, dude.  Ugh, you lump.  You know, and all that shit.  And I go, you know, Bobby, you haven't lost all the weight yet.  So stop talking like you have. 
[00:12:00]  And he got like all quiet and walked away for a minute.  And I literally, I was like, Bobby, I was just kidding, man.  Like, I felt fucking bad.  Right.  And then I was like, you know what?  Fuck you, dude.  You're sitting here making fun of my slouch and all this shit.  Yeah, you were defending yourself.  Yeah.  Bob, you can't be a sensitive bully.  Bob did the same thing to me.  You know, because he's brutal.  You'll walk in, and he's, you know, hey, sock puppet.  And, you know, hey, turtle.  And then I said something to him about being fat. 
[00:12:30]  And he's like, dude, you're fatter than me.  I'm like, no, I'm not, Bob.  You're fatter.  And he goes, all right, dude, I'll take off my shirt.  You take off your shirt.  I'm like, great comedy response.  Fucking asshole.  Don't make it real.  He has to make it real.  He's nuts.  He got mad at me one time at the cellar.  I sat down, and Bob really gets mad if he teases weight.  Yeah.  Because he has lost a lot of weight.  So if you're listening, shithead, we know you've lost.  Yeah, relax.  You look good.  65 to 70% of the weight you had to lose.  You've lost. 
[00:13:00]  A lot of it.  Yeah.  Maybe 80%.  You only got 25 pounds to go.  We know.  Yeah.  You've lost fucking 80 pounds.  But that's the one, that's Bob's fucking, I guess, Achilles dorsal fin.  If you want, he just can't take weight jokes anymore.  He gets so fucking angry.  Yeah.  And he really reacts like Paulie in Rocky.  You know what I mean?  He really gets into that like, I'm something too.  You know?  I'm like, Jesus.  I'm sorry.  I was just fucking around, man.  Hey, Bob, I'm just having fun.  I'll throw the turkey out the window. 
[00:13:30]  Let's get back to Susan Boyle.  So, she's on Britain's Got Talent.  Well, let's play this for Joe DeRosa.  This is her going on the stage.  You're going to hear a lot of laughing.  Okay.  Because she's just hideous.  She's the nicest, nicest thing ever.  She's so sweet.  She'd be the perfect wife if you could get past the visual.  She would never give you a problem.  You would never have a fight with her.  She would do anything for you. 
[00:14:00]  She'd not embarrass you publicly.  She is a fucking, an atrocity.  It's interesting that she's never kissed a man.  She's never kissed anything in her life.  But here's how it went down one more time for Joe DeRosa.  You know who she looks like?  Fucking Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.  Nerds!  You know what I'm finding out too?  The picture of Susan Boyle that everyone's checking out from Britain's Got Talent.  That's her all, like, gussied up.  The pictures Danny are showing. 
[00:14:30]  Holy crap!  She's way worse.  Yeah, she's brutal.  Way worse when she doesn't have the makeup artists and the hair people and the nice lighting.  She's got the same hair as Danny.  She really does have fucking Danny Ross slash Gene Wilder hair.  She's fucking terrible.  She looks like Kathy Bates if Kathy Bates was retarded.  She looks like Kathy Bates if she were Philip Seymour Hoffman. 
[00:15:00]  You got one, Joe?  Making a trifecta.  That one kind of put me over.  I thought that was a good closing.  Alright, let's go with this then.  Alright, what's your name, darling?  My name is Susan Boyle.  Okay.  Susan, where are you from?  I am from Blackburn near Bathgate, West Lothian.  It's a big town.  It's a sort of collection of...  It's a collection of...  Villages.  And how old are you, Susan?  I am 47. 
[00:15:30]  Britain is brutal, man.  I thought we were brutal in America, but...  I know a comic that moved to England and, you know, he's been over there for a few years  and I saw him at the Comedy Cellar one night and he goes...  I go, how's England?  How's England?  And he goes, you know what?  You know what?  Everybody says...  Evidently, the comic is Bobby Kelly.  That's the only fucking voice I can do.  I was just saying.  Sounds like Bob.  Yeah.  But he goes, everybody says it's so fucking smart over there and everything.  He goes, the crowds are dumber and they heckle you three times as much as they do here. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And it just popped the whole illusion that I always had about England being like...  Mm-hmm.  They're just fucking tea sipping, you know?  No, not at all.  They're brutal.  Patrice brutalizes England, man, because he spent a lot of time over there.  And I've always refused to go for that reason.  You should go.  I don't think they'd like me.  I'm not...  My impression of England, it could be wrong, is that they only like certain type of American  comedians.  The guys that are like, yeah, you know, America's a bunch of redneck.  Like, they like the ones that just kind of shit on America, because I think deep down 
[00:16:30]  the British citizens don't like us.  I don't think they like us.  But you should go and film it, because your fans would love to see how you're treated over  there.  Can you imagine?  That would be very interesting.  Sure.  Back to Susan Boyle.  And you hear the crowd, they're chuckling and just mocking her.  And that's just one side of me.  Okay, what's the dream?  I'm trying to be a professional singer. 
[00:17:00]  And why hasn't it worked out so far, Susan?  I've never been given the chance before, but here's hoping it'll change.  Okay, and who would you like to be as successful as?  Elaine Paige.  Elaine Paige.  What are you going to sing tonight?  I'm going to sing I Dreamed a Dream from the Miserables.  So there's the set up.  Alright.  What did she say she's going to sing?  I Dreamed a Dream from the Miserables.  Oh, Les Miserables.  Okay.  Les Mizz.  Okay.  Les Mizz.  Listen what comes out of this monster. 
[00:17:30]  I Dreamed a Dream in time gone by.  You used to match by that, did you?  Did you?  No.  My dream and love would never die.  I'd never thought it would be for me. 
[00:18:00]  When I was young and unafraid.  When dreams were made and used and wasted.  There was no ransom to be paid.  No swung and swung, no wine tasted. 
[00:18:30]  Unreal.  She's good, right?  Yeah, she's really good.  And she should have turned to that audience and said, you know what?  You're all cunts.  Yeah.  You fucking laughed at me and you booed me and I could sing.  Yeah.  But she's semi-retarded.  You just animate that with the hottest, you know, animated chick and they got something.  Yeah.  Like a Jasmine from Aladdin.  Yeah.  Type of thing.  There you go.  We're the most average animated animal.  Doesn't even have to be the hottest chick.  Can be a fucking, a mediocre seal.  Whatever it is.  An animated badger.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Kev Baloo from the Jungle Book.  Singing that fucking thing.  She is a fucking brute.  Oh.  Yeah, she's rough.  But the update, so everyone's checking her out online.  Her videos have been seen by, it's now up to 12 million people.  Wow.  In the last like two, three days.  Now do you think-  12 million views.  Do you think she can carry the, like take the ball and run with it with the singing  or do you think like she knows one song and she can bail out that song?  If not, she could take the ball and balance it on her nose for a little while.  They're saying, I mean, what do we know? 
[00:19:30]  But they're saying that she's going to be like the favorite now.  Jesus Christ.  That's Britain's Got Talent.  We do.  America's Got Talent, obviously, so.  Yeah.  But now we're going to all be paying attention to that show.  The-  No.  No, no, no.  It is so weird and it's the obvious point that we've all, we made it yesterday  and it's an obvious point but it is amazing how like you look at somebody and the bottom  line is if she was pretty and she sang like that, you'd go, wow, she's a good singer.  But because she's ugly, she inspires surprise that she's good. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And even the judge even says it at the beginning of that clip.  He goes, whoever it was, he goes, you weren't expecting that, were you?  It's like, why not?  No, some guy from the side of the stage.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, the Ryan Seacrest guy.  Why wouldn't-  Because every one of these shows is formulated the same now.  Like, you wouldn't expect an ugly woman to be able to sing okay?  Like, I don't understand that.  Where's the logic?  Don't you expect all ugly women to sing real well?  Because what else are they doing?  Yeah, exactly.  They're practicing their vocal talent.  It's like how a blind person has a heightened sense of hearing.  Yeah.  They're real surprised. 
[00:20:30]  Well, of course.  She probably knows how to sing a tune and suck a mean cock.  She probably knows.  And that's it.  Me sucky sucky.  There you go.  Hey, you looked.  No.  You looked.  No, I didn't set that up.  I saw me sucky sucky and I fucking hit the goddamn-  Is he allowed to look at the buttons?  Yeah, I think he should be allowed to look.  All right, Joe DeRose is two for two.  Oh, you're saying I gotta just hit him without looking.  Yeah.  That was fun.  Oh, okay, I'll do that.  Because you nailed it with the first one.  I'll totally do that.  All right.  Okay, hold on. 
[00:21:00]  All right, so we're gonna take that one away from you.  You wanna try it again though?  Yeah, go ahead.  So what-  Wait, what were we talking about?  So we think she would give you the greatest head ever, right?  Yeah.  She knows how to sing a tune and suck a mean cock.  All right.  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Still not bad.  You know what?  Danny will be the judge.  I think he pulled it off.  You know what I'll do?  Every so often, I'll just change the banks so that I'll give that nice random element.  I'm gonna give you that one just because he said, is that so?  After your comment.  And I'll go like this before I do it. 
[00:21:30]  I'll put a finger up as a fucking-  That is fun.  Wow.  Every picture you find of her gets worse.  This one looks like she's a tranny.  Show Jimmy this one.  She's kind of made up, but who the fuck does she look like in this?  She's driving me nuts.  Well, she looks like-  What's her face?  Julia-  Julia Childs?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  Yesterday we said Lithgow.  She does look like John Lithgow.  She's a really bizarre looking woman.  She's a very homely woman. 
[00:22:00]  She's also got one of those British midget heads.  Even though she's not a midget.  She looks like one of the time bandits.  I mean, these people are sitting far away from-  This is an interview clip we're watching of her from Britain.  And they just-  They're kind of sitting far away across the desk.  How is it being as visually unpleasant as you are?  Nosferatu.  Now she should just stay ugly.  Well, obviously.  I mean, then I could be able to do too much with her, but-  Yeah, please.  She should really ugly it up. 
[00:22:30]  Ugly it up.  Yeah.  Or make a home porno tape with some fucking black ex-prisoner.  Yeah.  How could they make-  If she got a stylist to make her own ugly, they'd be like,  Can we do that pitbull, eat your face off thing?  Yeah.  And then we'll build you a new face.  Like Travis the Chimp rip her fucking lips and eyes off and that awful hairdo and her neck fat start over.  How great would it be if she, you know, continues down this path and then it comes out that she's the greatest serial killer of all time.  They find the bodies. 
[00:23:00]  Or she was just lip syncing the whole time.  Yeah.  There's a great picture of her-  Oh, that's her horrible house.  Oh, is she awful?  Here she is.  She's making-  Look at her.  Her feet are enragingly fucking fat and awful.  She's standing-  It looks like she's crossing a street.  And you know the thinker, how the thinker is sitting down and he's got his, like, fist kind of curled up against his forehead?  Mm-hmm.  She's doing that pose, but she's standing to the side in a street.  Yeah.  And it looks like she's baking bread in her shoes.  That's-  Yeah, she really has, like, a little fat, swollen feet.  Poor little fat, tubby feet. 
[00:23:30]  Can I see her house again?  Oh, my God.  Where do you expect an ugly bra to live?  Yeah.  A barn.  I thought maybe God gave her a break somewhere.  She'd have a big house.  She's like, I did well in the market.  Right.  You know, like something.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  You know what's sad about the picture of her house?  They're not showing the whole house, so that means she only has a part of that horrible house.  Oh, God almighty.  Dude, when it sucks in England, it really sucks.  Oh, boy.  And now she's got her house dress on in this picture. 
[00:24:00]  Danny is-  And she pretty much can touch each wall of her living room because she has her hands out.  Oh, Jesus Christ almighty, dude.  Oh, there she is.  Why would you have a mirror in your house?  Yeah.  So she can practice her Les Miserables songs.  That's, you know, that's what she's doing.  Look at that fucking couch, dude.  Oh.  That's the kind of couch-  Ah, never mind.  All right.  There's also a story kind of related to being fat, and we talked about flying.  Oh, yeah.  The flying story is awesome. 
[00:24:30]  Um, I fucking love United Airlines, because I'm a continental flyer, and they're starting  to join with-  What are we looking at?  By the way, we got-  Every phone is lit, but I don't know what they want to talk about.  Are we having a problem with the phone still?  Uh, apparently.  If we-  They're all lit.  No, I see them.  Can we get them?  Let's see.  But I don't know what they want to talk about.  Hold on, man.  We're still, like, kind of tweaking the new studio here at Sirius.  Hmm. 
[00:25:00]  All right, we'll have to figure that out during the break.  Yeah, let's just grab them randomly.  They probably have some nice monster comments.  Can we get to them?  Can we just click on them and see what they want?  Yeah, I don't give a crap.  That's it.  We could certainly do that.  That's like DeRosa with the fucking bank over there.  We have no idea.  All right.  Dang it.  Hi, who are you?  Hello?  Yeah, we got a problem with the phones.  Is it hooked up right?  That...  I'll try another one.  What is...  Hello, hello, hello.  I love the guy coming in.  Hello, hello. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  All right, there's Danny's biopi now looking.  I like how people, and it's not our people.  When we have a problem, they kind of saunter around to get to the problem.  Oh, that's nice.  We're live.  This is a pressure cooker.  Will you run for us, please?  Yeah.  We're sitting here like...  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  We don't want moseying.  We don't want meandering.  We don't want to fucking bolt in here and fix it.  Yeah, they're just like...  You need staples or something like that.  Yeah, they're just like, all right. 
[00:26:00]  We're live.  But it's amazing when you're live how you know that everyone's listening, so you panic  and you look at everybody.  I actually just looked at the interns and I'm like, what the fuck is he just standing  there?  What is he going to do?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've done other shows here before and this is the first show, obviously, because of the  stature of the show.  Yeah.  Where there's not like four guys just in the room standing over.  Burr and I did a promo thing here once where we did like sort of an hour together and there 
[00:26:30]  was just like four guys standing behind us and...  Why?  We don't know.  And they were telling us like how to take calls and what not to do.  Oh, shut up.  And then Bill's like, dude, I didn't fucking take calls.  You know, like he was really getting like hot about it.  Sure.  I was too, but he had the authority to say something because it was his fucking show.  All right.  Well, we'll get to the phones in a minute.  It looks like they're, you know, they got good stuff.  You can just tell because every phone is ringing.  That means they really want to jump in on this monster talk. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, does Pete Dominick still have a show here?  Does anybody know?  He's a guy, he's a comedian we know.  Yeah.  Who I like.  And he has a pretty good show.  I mean, I've been on it.  I haven't actually listened to it.  I don't know.  It was good when I was on it.  I don't know.  Does nobody know?  I think he still has it.  What do we know about United there, Jimmy?  Oh, just that they're...  This is something that has been one of Norton's pet peeves for a long time.  I guess it's a pet peeve of all of us.  Who are we kidding?  Anybody who flies deals with it.  United is going to start charging heavier passengers twice the amount to fly for two seats. 
[00:27:30]  And when I was coming back from L.A., I saw some people...  Like, in the first seat in coach, there's a middle and two ends.  There's three seats.  And the guy, there's a black dude in the middle seat.  And he was built like fucking Eric Williams from the Cowboys.  Jesus.  He was...  Good topical reference, Jim.  Eric Williams retired like 98.  I'm in on the reference.  But the guy was...  He was massive.  But he wasn't an obese guy.  He was...  He might not be a good example, because he was a big dude. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  But he was literally hanging over, and there's like a little white businessman in each seat  just kind of cowering out.  And it's like, that's a cross-country flight.  You should never have to fucking be subjected to somebody else's obesity.  Yeah.  It's like, that's an addictive behavior, and it's like, their addiction's affecting you.  It's like, I'm an alcoholic.  I can't drink.  So if I drank on the plane and was affecting other people with my fucking drinking, they'd  throw me the fuck off.  Obesity...  Excuse me.  Obesity's a tough one, because it's like, that is the only addiction where you are forced 
[00:28:30]  to consume the thing you're addicted to.  Like, alcohol, you can avoid the alcohol or drugs.  So I do feel bad for fat people.  And also, too, that it is a little genetic.  I eat like an animal, and I don't gain weight, except for a little bit here or whatever.  Yeah.  So it sucks, but at the same time, there's always that point where it's like, bro, look,  if this is your lot in life, this is your lot in life.  And if you gain weight like that, don't just keep eating, and then I gotta deal with your fat folds.  I can't have the fucking armrest down, because you're too big. 
[00:29:00]  But it's also what they eat, too.  Like, I've watched them do it.  And I know it's an addiction.  But I've watched people who weigh like 350, 400, eating like shit.  And it's like, you know what, man?  No one likes eating healthy.  It sucks.  Yeah, that part's not an addiction.  That part is just fucking...  You're making those choices.  If you have to eat a lot, whatever, sure.  But, you know, it has to be Oreos every single time.  My solution's very simple.  And you're right.  It's fucking...  On the seat rest, you have a seat rest, right? 
[00:29:30]  The seats should now be equipped where on the seat, on the armrest, you should be able  to, if you want, to split the armrest for you and I both to get 50-50, a little piece  of plastic that you raise six inches.  Almost like a little piece of plastic window that comes up.  Yeah.  So if you want just a little bit of privacy and to lean against it, you raise it like that.  And if somebody's fat, they'll kind of be trapped in their fucking section.  That's a great idea.  And for years, I've been thinking that.  It's like a little privacy thing that goes up.  And this way, either person can do it and you both get half the armrest. 
[00:30:00]  The problem with sitting next to some of those guys, you know, by the time you get off your  flight, you need a chiropractor because you've been leaning to the right the entire flight.  And then you walk in and something just doesn't feel right.  I also think you should, I'm not trying to be funny.  I'm serious.  I think you should absolutely be charged extra, too, if you're bringing a baby on the flight.  I mean, that drives me fucking crazy.  It's like, I don't give a shit if you have to get somewhere with your baby.  I have nothing to do with that at all.  I got to do a five-hour flight to LA. 
[00:30:30]  Your baby's crying the whole fucking time.  I shouldn't have to deal with that, man.  Where are you at with babies?  My thing is very easy.  Drown them.  Yeah.  You can't avoid them, you know, in life.  In life, but all I want is the parent to show me they're trying to control their kid.  That's the only thing I ever asked for.  Exactly.  I mean, that's it.  And the kid continues to cry after that, I could deal.  But these parents where, you know, the kid is just completely out of control and they just  let the kid keep going, that drives me nuts. 
[00:31:00]  Well.  Nuts.  They're tired and they're, you know, they're spent and you don't know what it's like to  have a three-year-old.  Right, right.  I don't give a shit.  It's like the fat thing.  This is the position you're in.  This is your lot in life.  This is not my fucking deal right now.  Deal with this shit, man.  How about when you're on a plane, the baby's crying, crying, crying, finally falls asleep.  We've told this story a few times on the show.  Now it's peaceful.  It's a peaceful flight.  And the stupid parent that's unaware of everybody else wakes up the kid before the plane lands. 
[00:31:30]  So now the kid is now crying for the last half hour of the flight?  Mm-hmm.  You couldn't let the kid sleep until we land?  No.  It's one of the most inconsiderate, you know, behaviors that I can think of is this mentality  that the whole world has to appreciate and understand what my dealing with my kid is like.  Mm-hmm.  I don't give a fuck.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's absurd.  It's ridiculous.  And you couldn't do that with any other thing. 
[00:32:00]  Like, if you were, if you had a sick parent that shits their pants all the time, you know,  you couldn't just bring the sick parent out and go, hey guys, well, he shits all over stuff  and rubs it on the walls because he's senile.  You know what I mean?  I go, sorry guys!  You know what I mean?  Like, only with a baby do people expect you to go, oh, okay, you know.  I would like to go to that party, though.  Yeah.  Sorry, my husband's abusive.  He hits.  Sorry, lady.  That's just what he does.  We have some of our bigger listeners checking in.  They're saying, look, it's not, not every fat person you see is a result of food addiction. 
[00:32:30]  That's Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  He's a regular.  I think Joe said it, though.  Part of it is genetic.  We understand that.  Yeah, there are people.  I've always said you're born with a body type and then it's up to you decide if you're going  to be on the low end of that body type or the, or the high end.  Because I'm like you.  I could eat anything and I don't really gain that much weight.  I put weight on.  I think you put weight on easy.  You have to kind of watch.  I have to watch what I eat.  It would be hard for me to balloon up to fucking obese weight, like 300.  But I could get, I'm probably between 156 and 160 right now. 
[00:33:00]  I could get to 190.  I know I could get up to 200 if I ate wrong.  It would be very hard for me to fucking really go beyond that.  So you pretty much, your body type, you could be anywhere from one.  Is my body pepper sushi?  Just fucking mush.  But you could probably go from 150 to 200 is probably your body type.  In there, yeah.  I mean to me 150 is a great weight for me.  I'm like, you know, I'm like fine right now, but I could be a few pounds lighter or  a few pounds heavier and live. 
[00:33:30]  I don't like to be, you know, 180 for me is a devastatingly fat weight.  If I got 180, I'd be fucking finished.  I mean, so we're acknowledging that it is a genetic thing too.  But it's hard to, Blue Heeler or anybody, you have to admit, how many people do you know?  And look, sometimes it's hard to eat.  Like down south, you go on the road, man.  Everywhere you go, they have, we don't have skim milk.  It's like, well, why don't you?  Right.  How fucking hard is it to buy a skim milk, you assholes?  Right.  It's like, it is hard sometimes in restaurants to eat healthy, like because they just don't  have anything that's healthy. 
[00:34:00]  But how many times do you see someone fucking 400 pounds who literally is eating like salads  and being careful about what they eat and eating whole wheat bread?  You don't.  Yeah.  Last night I was in our supermarket.  Jimmy and I live relatively close.  Yeah, we're neighbors.  We're neighbors.  My building and his building, basically.  Yeah.  And I was down there getting some dinner, some quick dinner.  And there was a country pork chop, all made, ready to go, deep fried.  I wanted that so bad. 
[00:34:30]  And then I looked to the left and it was the lame, boring chicken breast.  Pick the chicken breast.  Yeah.  I think-  I wasn't happy about it.  Actually, I kind of wish I did the pork chop last night though.  Was it breaded and just-  Oh, it was ready to rock.  It looks so good, man.  It was breaded and deep fried and cooked.  You just popped that in the microwave for, I don't know, 90 seconds and you're good to go.  Yeah, 130.  I was so ready to just, you know, grab that.  And you pick up that bone at the end of it and just suck all the gristle and fat. 
[00:35:00]  Nothing better than a pork chop if it's cooked right.  But, you know, I don't even think that stuff's that bad if you eat, you know, not a deep fried pork chop, but it's like, you know, when I eat right, I eat steak, I eat pork, I eat chicken, and I eat it with salad.  And I just don't deep fry any of it.  I don't put oil all over it.  I use Italian dressing on my salad.  I eat a little bit of starch with it.  Yeah.  That's eating healthy, man.  It's just like, guys go out, you know.  A lot of fat guys don't eat, they don't eat all day.  What they do is they wait.  They don't eat properly. 
[00:35:30]  They wait, and then they hit like a Wendy's and it's like, I'll take the triple whatever burger and a salad with ranch dressing on it or whatever.  Yeah, and that's why, and then they gain weight because they're eating in the wrong, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, and the reason I like, it's like, it is like fucking decision making.  It's like, I know that I can, again, not get to probably 350 unless I really try, but I know that I can get really a lot worse than I am now.  A lot worse.  And it's like, I don't want to, so I don't fucking, I don't get the pork chop. 
[00:36:00]  You think I don't want to?  I hate not eating cake.  I fucking love cake.  I would eat cake every night.  Who wouldn't?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I'm trying to eat a little better right now, and I'm fine all day.  I do everything right all day, and then at like midnight, every deli I'm like, I just want to go get six of those Nemo's chocolate cakes.  You are talking everyone's language that attempts to eat right.  You do it, you eat perfect the entire day, and then you have a breakdown late, and then all of a sudden you're eating like 2,000 calories at 10 o'clock at night. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  What am I doing?  It's like I can't even do it.  I'm like, I can't even walk in that deli because I'll look like a cake bukkake.  I'll have it all over my fucking face.  You just want to, you just want to attack it.  It's, I can't, dude, I tap out at like 2, 10.  That's like the most I can get up to.  Like if I ever got some acting role, like Raging Bull, where they're like, you have to get fat.  I'd be like, I can't.  It's like, which I'm very lucky about, but at the same time, it's kind of scary, because it's almost being like a blackout drunk, where I'm like, I could eat McDonald's all the time, constantly, and I don't have the physical, outside physical effects of it. 
[00:37:00]  But God knows what's going on inside my body.  You know what I mean?  Joe would put weight on like a woman, I think.  You'd put it on in your hips and your hiney.  I can see you getting like fucking, like older fat lady body.  Like, because your upper body is kind of small, like your thin shoulders.  And I can see you putting on like lower hips. 
[00:37:30]  They're asking when, well, let me read this one.  When are you fags going to stop talking about cake?  We are lame.  We are.  And I wanted to get to a call you hung up.  Susan Boyle, one last observation.  She looks like Shrek's wife.  That one has to be said.  I don't know who she is.  I've never seen Shrek.  Pop up Shrek's wife.  Can we get phoned yet or no?  Yeah, I think so.  But now there's, there's nothing really worth going to.  Why don't we take a break?  Got Joe DeRosa in for Anthony today.  And also Keith Robinson coming in.  Finally, that fucking bastard. 
[00:38:00]  Uh, Keith is coming in at 730.  Dude, you're, and Joe, you're at comics tonight.  Yeah, I'm hosting a show at comics tonight.  Alright, very cool.  Anything else you want to promote?  Uh, I'll be at the Eastville Comedy Club this weekend at 10,  on the 10 o'clock and midnight shows Friday, Saturday.  Where's that, Joe?  It's down, it's on 4th Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue.  What the fuck?  Uh, it's been there about six months.  What the hell's going on with all these comedy clubs popping up?  Next week, Burr.  Me and Burr, Columbus, Ohio, at a club that I'll have to find the name of after the break. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know what club is in Columbus.  Uh, I can't remember.  I'll re-plug it again later.  I think people can look it up.  Alright.  Uh, Joe in Jersey was one of the many that said Susan looks like Shrek's wife.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Shrek's wife is actually hotter.  Just gotta make the eyebrows a little bushier and it's a match.  Alright, we're gonna continue.  Opie and Anthony...  And Steve, by the way, congratulations.  It's the worst shirt I've seen in six months.  Thank you. 
[00:39:00]  Holy shit.  Thank you.  That's what we do.  Shake it in. 
[00:39:30]  Dance, motherfuckers!  Dance, motherfuckers!  Dance, motherfuckers!  I want into music, man. 
[00:40:00]  Shut, shut, shut your face.  I want into music, man.  Shut, shut, shut your face.  I want into music, man.  I want into music, man. 
[00:40:30]  I want into music, man. 
[00:41:00]  that's the real feel 
[00:41:30]  yeah  but the virus is P, 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the real deal  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the kick  Yeah, that's what we do  I like it  I like it  I like it  I like it 
[00:42:30]  I like it  Yeah, we're live  Holy crap, I gotta give props to Drew Boogie  I haven't heard that remix in a long time  That was one of the first ones he did  That's the real deal  If anyone gave a shit about us  That could be a cool single  And Drew Boogie's got a CD out 
[00:43:00]  With all his remixes on it  And that's all I know  I don't even know where you could go to get it  I'm sorry, Drew  Oh, hold on  Go ahead, Danny  There's links everywhere  You know, the regular sites  And also, I do believe he's got some stuff up on iTunes  You can get a lot of those remixes up on iTunes  Right on  Joe DeRozan filling in for Anthony today  Anthony's at a funeral  Those are always fun  That sucks  Yeah  I hate funerals  I mean, you know, everyone does  But I'll tell you why I hate them  Because, you know, your own sadness 
[00:43:30]  You could kind of control  And then you go in the room  And everyone else's sadness  Brings you down to a level  That you had no intention of going down to  You know, the relative that falls down on the ground  And the other one that is like, you know  Crawling her way into the coffin  Yeah  Take me with you  It's like, this already sucks  Do you have to make it worse for everybody else?  You know  Now you're just being embarrassing  Right  Let's just pull it together  This is  I always  I'm so out of touch with my emotions 
[00:44:00]  I go to a funeral  And the whole time I'm like  I don't understand why I'm not sad right now  Why am I not crying?  Yeah  And then I have that moment at the cemetery  Where I have a complete breakdown  And need, like, my mom to hold me  I'm like, oh, there's all that suppressed emotion  Yeah, that forever thing really creeps you out  Oh my God  I remember  My grandma  I think she was like 92 when she passed  90, somewhere around there  Same thing  I was cool until we got to the cemetery 
[00:44:30]  And then we're in this, like, beautiful  I don't even know what it's called in the cemetery  Where they put the casket before they put it in the ground  It's this beautiful thing  And everyone gathers around  And puts the rose on the coffin  The final thing  And then me and my brother  Because we're pretty damn curious about  Just everything going on in the world and life  We're like, wow  What happens after this point, right?  And the priest is there  It's like, this now concludes  The ceremony for your dead grandma 
[00:45:00]  Meaning go home  And now the coffin's just sitting there  We're like, screw that  So we kind of hung out  And they wheel it out the back  And then you see the hole that is freshly dug  And it's a bunch of Mexicans  In this case it was  With shovels  Like, looking at their, like, watches  Like, can we get this over with?  We want to do lunch  You realize it's just their job  To get this dumb coffin in the ground  And get some dirt over it  So they can move on to their next task  That's a bummer, isn't it? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  You think it's some glorious thing that happens  After you leave the cemetery  But no, they're pretty much  And you know they're not going to be, you know  Careful with the coffin  They're going to drop that thing  Yeah, they drop the one end in first  Oh, I'm sure  And then your grandma's got a crooked neck  For eternity  When my grandfather died  He was in the Knights of Columbus  And when he died  The, you know  They sent the Knights of Columbus  To the service  To the church service part of the funeral 
[00:46:00]  To give him, you know  His send off  And everybody, you know  The whole family was like  It's going to be really nice  And this is really special  Or whatever  And the Knights of Columbus came in  And they gave this speech  For my grandfather  And they go  They go  We will miss and honor your memory  Joe De La Rosa  And my fucking family was living  My uncle's in the lobby of the church  They can't get the fucking name right  Jesus  Like  Yeah  Oh my God  Oh, it was brutal 
[00:46:30]  But then they did the  You want to talk about getting choked up  He was in World War II  They did the military  Oh yeah  Salute at the grave  And this soldier  Who didn't even know  He never even met my grandfather  Did the speech and the salute  He started crying  Because he got so worked up  About like the honor  You know what I mean  Of the soldier  Sure  And it was brutal  That's when I broke down  Yeah, that's heavy stuff  And then they hand the flag  Oh, Jesus, dude  And our families  You know, they handed it to my mom 
[00:47:00]  Because my dad was a military guy  Yeah, that's a moment  Yeah, right  Oh, wow  Yeah  Wow  That's hardcore, dude  Nothing but respect for those guys  Because they didn't know my father  But they played right through to the end  Well, there's something so impressive, too  About a guy that just like  You know, to see those soldiers  Like to see somebody that believes in something that much  And is that passionate about it  You're like  You know, you don't see that very often, obviously  I don't see it in myself  You know, I lose interest in the 
[00:47:30]  You know, I'll drift off halfway through this conversation  Yeah, sure  Yeah, passionate about furthering the agenda of a fascist regime  Oh, boy  Did Bill Hicks just walk in here?  People who just knee-jerk react against the military  Like, what?  Hey, uh  Before we move on  And instant feedback  Some of you guys had instant feedback from your cell phones  Leave your name so you get a little credit  This guy writes  We were talking about being fat and stuff, right?  I love this one 
[00:48:00]  I was at a diner that had a dessert  That was 12 scoops of ice cream  And 12 fudge brownies  And here's the kicker  If you eat the whole thing  You get a free poster  Wow  The poster is you jerking off  While hot women run the opposite direction  Fucking  What's the poster of?  I don't know, man  If the guy could, you know  Give me a part two on that  Probably Leonard Lawrence  Like on the toilet  In full metal jacket  Because that's what you should do 
[00:48:30]  It's probably just a poster of the dessert  Congratulations  You ate this  Oh my god almighty  They should put that poster  Over your front door  Like the fucking  Oh fuck  Never mind  Go ahead, start over  What was that Jewish holiday  Or the fucking Passover  Where they put the blood  That's what I was going for  And I lost it  And fuck it  Oh my god  Steven S. from Bayshore  I'm not even sure if he's going for the joke here  Because this is part funny  And part true  Hey Ope  Have you ever whispered about another relative 
[00:49:00]  And said  Hey  She's ruining the funeral  Yes  I have  You've actually said those words  She's  Not the one in the casket  Because there's always one  That just brings you down  To a level that  You had no intention of going to  Yeah  You know  I had a string of people  Die in my family  And you know  You mourn privately  After all that's done  In general  But some people  They have to let it all out  Right there in front of everybody 
[00:49:30]  You know what the worst is  Do you ever  Like the people  They get that fake fucking  They get that fake sentiment  At a moment like that  Where they're just standing there going  Life man  Oh yeah  Oh fuck off  Yeah  You know  This sucks  Let's go get wasted  This sucks  In my family  There are the cool members of the family  That are in the back  While the body's up front  And they're in the back of the room  Making jokes  And just having a good old time  You know  I like that  Yeah  I like that  I love the ones 
[00:50:00]  That try to make  They try to be so positive  They're like  You know  Someone's dead  They're like  Why are we all so sad  Because they're dead  Asshole  We get it  They're in a better place  They're not in a better place  The Mexicans are dropping them  In the fucking hole  Yeah  They're in a terrible place  They're dead  Well  We got some guys  That worked at a cemetery  I don't even know  If we want to go down this road  Yeah  Of course we do  Let's go to Pittsburgh  And say hi to Tim  Pittsburgh  A big O&A market  What's up Tim  Hey boys 
[00:50:30]  How you doing  Pretty good  Joe DeRosa  Filling in for Anthony  Doing a great job today  I just want to say  Joe  Thanks  Go ahead Tim  Hey I used to work  In a cemetery  And I got a fucked up story  If you want to hear it  Sure  Alright  So the wife is grieving  And this is all just so bad  Everybody's crying  I know I'm used to it  Whatever  Let's throw him in the fucking ground  And let's go to lunch  We're lowering him in  To the ground  Into the vault  Because the casket goes  In the cement vault  And the fucking straps break  The fucking coffin falls down there  And there's an arm hanging out  And everybody loses it 
[00:51:00]  Loses it  My boss looks  I'm just in college  He's like  Get down there  And I'm like  What the fuck do you mean  Get down there  He's like  Get in there motherfucker  Look at them  They're losing it  I had to go in there  And put the arm back in  Swear to God  Oh my gosh  You talk about having a bad day  That's all it would take too  An arm popping out  Of one of those  Effing coffins  It was the worst  The widow lost it dude  She lost it  I don't need to laugh  Alright boys  Punch it out  Have a good day  Good job Tim  Let's go to John in Indiana 
[00:51:30]  John  Yeah  They make sure you're good and dead  They also put water inside the coffin there  To make you know the level of ground  So you know that way you fucking drown  If they're not dead already  Wait they put water where?  No way  They put water in a hole  Yes  Settle the ground  They fill the hole full of water  Alright and then that water  Kind of like  You know  Goes into the earth  Did you hear what his explanation  In case you're not already dead  You'll drown  Right right  Alright  Thank you John  Let's go to New Hampshire 
[00:52:00]  Ken  This is a humane way of doing it  Hey Ken how are you?  Not too bad  How are you doing?  Pretty good Ken  Yeah same story  Like the guy before  Was talking about how the arm fell out  Yeah  We were doing a removal  Where it was a veteran  Getting moved to a  To a veteran cemetery  So you have to dig down in the coffin  The guy had been in the hole  For eight years  Cement box  So the cement's all  It's pretty much just like clay  It's really soft  My boss goes  Hop down in the hole  I jump down in the hole  I go right through the box  Right through the coffin 
[00:52:30]  I'm standing on the guy's chest  I crush  Yes  My boss goes  Jesus Christ  Thank God the fucking family's not here  Can I tell you how great Carlin was  His bit about how  How fucking  The ritual of burying the dead  We have a homeless problem  He's like  Just get rid of the graveyards  He's like  It's an old idea  Just plow those motherfuckers  Into the river  And fucking use the land  To put people  It was a great bit 
[00:53:00]  And it really is  Is it a long bit?  We should play that  I honestly don't remember  It might just be a line he used  I don't remember where it was  Do a little research  See if it's a little bit we can play  Because you know  Nothing wrong with playing some Carlin  It is creepy  Like my mom's real  Yeah I come from an Italian family  My mom's real big  I'm like let's go visit the grave  And I never go with her  I'm like I don't want to do that  It's weird  Like  It's just weird  I go every once in a while  To my dad's site  And it's like  Alright now what  And he didn't believe in that either  So I guess I got that from him 
[00:53:30]  Because he told me  He never went to his own dad's grave  So I'm like  Why am I at your grave then?  And every time you go to a grave  You have to do that obligatory  Tap the head stuff  Tap tap tap  I miss you buddy  You know  Like you have to do all that  You have to have the speech  It's just  It's like  It's awkward  It's  Do as far as Gump did  Just throw them in the backyard  Under a tree  Fucking mosey out  Chat with them  And go inside  Take a nice fucking  Coffee shit  Go on with your day  I don't go to  I don't ever go to  Graves  It's creepy 
[00:54:00]  Just think about the person  You don't need to stand  On their corpse  Just think about them  Yeah exactly  And tell a story about  How a candle blew out  And you knew that it was them  Should we  I knew they were in the room with me  Really?  Out of the window was open  Fucking shit  Shut up  They weren't in the room with you  Wouldn't that creep you out?  If you were having a moment  And grandmother blew out the  Because then I'd be starting to think  Like she was in the car  Every time I got blown  By a fucking prostitute  She was there  Every time I clipped  Clipped on questionable websites  Or  Ran out of steam in a joke 
[00:54:30]  Like there  Did I tell a story on the air  When  When we were going through  When we were going through  My dad's wake  It was in a funeral home  Where they had  You know  Two or three other  Wakes going on  But like ours ended  Then the other one started  Or somehow they were able  To kind of organize  This whole thing  And I was bored  Because I had to be there  The whole time  Had to  Sorry dad  I mean  You know  He probably would have  Only done a couple hours himself  That's where I got it from  And  Seed him believing all that  But  I started wandering around  The funeral home 
[00:55:00]  And there was an empty room  With all the chairs set up  Coughing in the front of the room  Walked up  Once again  Being curious about crap  Walked to the front of the freaking room  There's grandma  Not my grandma  Someone's grandma  But the stereotypical grandma  The  The cotton candy hair  That's kind of bluish  Pearls  Really nice  Like Sunday outfit on  Just laid out  The casket is open  Waiting for the freaking wake  I lean in to take a  Closer look  Swear to god  The lights go off in the room  And to this day 
[00:55:30]  I really need to know  Why the lights went off  Oh my god  I wonder if it was someone  I mean  I got some jokesters  In my family  And if one of them  Was around  They could have maybe  You know  Quickly turned the lights  Off and on  But I'm like  What the fuck  Is this about  Did you grab her tits  That would be the greatest  Story ever  If the lights went out  And it could be a ghost  And you just grabbed her tits  That's fucking hilarious  Like I know what you want  My grandma  When my grandfather died  I had to sleep  I had to stay at my  Grandmom's house 
[00:56:00]  For like a week  For all the stuff  Whatever  And I had to sleep  In the bedroom  I used to sleep in  When I was a kid  When I'd stay at her house  When I was a kid  It freaked me out  And I've never gotten over it  And you know  It's already sad and weird  Because he's dead  And everything  And I'm laying in the bed  Trying to go to sleep  And I roll over  And I'm all creeped out already  I roll over  She moved the chair  That he always sat in  Into the fucking room  And it's directly  Like in my eyeline  Next to the bed  And I'm like  So now I'm starting to think 
[00:56:30]  I'm going to wake up  He's going to be sitting  In the goddamn chair  And I was like  Thanks Nana  This week wasn't  Traumatic enough  Yeah you had to  Make it worse  Yeah we're in this  Fucking polder guy  Situation right now  Okay yeah  Let's take a few more  Of these morbid calls  Highway from North Carolina  Hey what's up guys  Hey Highway  Hi  Yeah the worst thing  Is when they play  A song right before  They take the body  To the grave site  And you know  All the families  There listening  My grandparents ruined 
[00:57:00]  Everybody Hurts  By R.E.M.  No one can listen  To that song now  But why even  It's amazing  Why play that stupid song  Yeah why bring you down  Even  I'm not a fan  Of bringing you down  Further than you  Already are  Like there's music  That could accent  All this stuff  And make you feel  Way worse  There's nothing positive  Coming out of playing  Everybody Hurts  At a funeral  One of the worst  Saddest songs  Ever already  Know what song  I can't do  Is a time of  What is it called  The Green Day song  Time of Your Life 
[00:57:30]  Yep  Or whatever it's called  Yeah  Everyone knows the song  I don't know it  I can't even hear it  Seriously for real  Cause same thing  They ruined it for me  All I can think of  Is  This is at a funeral  Think of this  But think about  How hip his parents are  They're listening to R.E.M.  My parents would  My parents would have  Played some Glenn Miller  But why not  Play something  A little like  Uplift  This is not uplifting  A Pennsylvania polka  Right  And then everybody  Runs through  And punches the body  In the face  If you're having  A threesome  This song  Is it gonna bring you up 
[00:58:00]  Oh Jesus Christ  Is it gonna bring you down  Could you imagine dude  Just playing this song  You got two chicks  Naked on your couch  Hold on girls  I'm gonna set the mood  Right  And you just start  Sharpening a knife to it  The hottest naked broads ever  There you are  Crying like a baby  Everybody hurts  Why  Why do we do this  To ourselves  I know  Oh now I gotta hang up  Alright  Yeah yeah alright  I'm sorry bro  And then you know  Like  This is the final song  That's the other thing 
[00:58:30]  About  When someone dies  You walk around  Like a zombie  For three days  It's  You're a zombie  If you wanna know  What a zombie  How a zombie lives  You know  When someone dies  That's close to you  You're gonna find out  Cause that's all you do  Alright now  It's time to go  To my aunt's house  For the six foot  Hero  And pasta dish  Alright now  We have to go  And visit  Where she used to live  Alright now  We're gonna go  To my mom's house  Like it's  You just wander around  For three days  Like a zombie 
[00:59:00]  That is the only good part  About a funeral  Is you get that  Carnival food afterwards  Right  Like hot roast beef  And meatballs  Yeah  That's alright  Usually get together  For a meal  And make believe  That the person  Didn't die  All of a sudden  Everything's happy  It's just the dumbest thing  I hate it  Yeah it sucks  I hate it  What's your ethnicity  By the way  What are you  I'm a mutt  I'm gonna guess  You're a little  German Irish  Tiny Irish  A lot of people  A lot of people  Think I'm very Irish 
[00:59:30]  But I have barely  Any Irish in me  I got  Unfortunately  I got a lot of Polish  Quarter Polish  Is the big one  The reason I ask  German  Aunt would be proud of that  Little Irish  I have a grandfather  That's from Canada  So whatever the hell  He was  Yeah  Do you guys do a lot of  Do you do like  The drinking thing  No  Because Irish and Italian  After a funeral  You just get  Loaded  Not a lot of drinkers  In my immediate family  The uncles 
[01:00:00]  Well they're another story  So  Yeah they rock  Well yeah  It helps after a funeral  It kind of takes the sting off  Well the phones are lit  Do you want to keep doing this  Absolutely man  I'm talking about this shit all day  You tell me which one you want  Had to bury your father twice  Casket fell sideways  I say that's a good one  Alright let's go to Ty in Atlanta  Ty  Yeah how's it going  Hey buddy  My father-in-law  At his funeral  He was a big dude  One of the straps broke  The casket fell in sideways 
[01:00:30]  They couldn't get it all the way in  They had to take it back out  Well then it wouldn't fit in the vault  So  My wife and her sister  Had to have two funerals  And we had to go back the next day  And do it all over again  Oh my god  To say they were a wreck  Yeah  Yeah  And then the guys that did it  Didn't really seem to give a shit  One way or another  They were just trying to get out of there  No it's  It's their job  We all have jobs  And that's  We just want to get the job done  We don't  We don't think of the emotional part of it  Did you laugh?  Did people laugh?  I mean like  Something like that 
[01:01:00]  Could be horrific  Or everybody could just laugh  Well everyone was pretty much gone  And it was just  Just the immediate family around  Yeah  The girls didn't take it too well  No  Dude he really  And then the next day  Wasn't a whole lot better  You know  Now you talk about it  It's not a big deal  They can laugh about it  But at the time  It was pretty traumatic  Sure  Yeah right on  Watching other people sad  Makes me sad  Like if I'm in a funeral  That's what I'm saying  That's the worst part  Like there are people  Who are just  Not even being drama whores  That's what I'm saying 
[01:01:30]  Who are just fucking  That's the worst  But I get pissed  I'm like  I don't need to see this  Yeah it's  Go outside  It's  It's brutal  It's almost like  Is this necessary right now?  I mean you gotta grieve  And you gotta respect  What just happened  But is it necessary?  Yeah  It's almost like a wedding  It gets to a point  Where it's almost gaudy  Where you're like  This is too much  We're indulging too much  In this thing right now  The wake was enough  We all came out  We looked at the body  We went up  We knelt there  You go down the line 
[01:02:00]  And shake the hands  That's enough  You don't have to go  To the cemetery  And watch them lower  A casket into the ground  Patrick Kaye from Texas  Oh the screen just went dead  Hey Opie  I wonder if someone  Tossed a rosin bag  On Mark Fidrich's  Mound of dirt  He's under now  I am  You don't know  Who Mark Fidrich is?  I don't know why  That fell flat  That is a funny joke  Because  Do you know who  Mark Fidrich is?  I think we're  Hoping for the  Joe DeRosa laugh  You got a good laugh  You should have laughed there 
[01:02:30]  Mark Fidrich died  Early this week  You don't know who  Mark Fidrich is?  He had one of the  Greatest rookie seasons  In baseball history  Are you a sports guy?  I don't follow sports  At all  That's why  Mark Fidrich comes out  Of nowhere  What happened?  Oh  No I was  You hit a button  You're going to try  To hit a button?  No but I was going to  I didn't want you to  I was just saying  I was just signaling  When you say this  I'm going to hit a button  Okay  But sorry  Mark Fidrich  Mark Fidrich  I believe  Rookie season went 
[01:03:00]  19-9  He was a sensation  He would talk to the ball  He would pat the mound  He was a lunatic  And baseball fell in love  With this guy  And then what happened  After that  He just sucked  I think he had an injury  Or something  He must have got hurt  Yeah and then  He only made it  Five years in the major leagues  After a 19-9 first season  His career record was  I think 29-19  So he went 10-10  Over the next four years  Complete disaster  Then he tried to come back 
[01:03:30]  With the Red Sox organization  82 or 83  I sound like Mad Dog  I got all this in my head  But he didn't make the comeback  Okay so he retires  And he's like a truck operator  In Northboro, Massachusetts  And now you know  They need his truck  Because of all the potholes  In the Massachusetts area  And he's under his dump truck  Getting it ready for the season  And something went horribly wrong  And Mark Fidrich  Is no longer with us  Oh Jesus Christ  My thing is this though  Like how much did he make  Because if it was  Sometimes you hear about 
[01:04:00]  Those sports stories that suck  Yeah  And then you figure  Look if the guy got hurt  Let's say he made  Say six million dollars  Well probably back then  That's a lot of money  For a young guy  They didn't get paid  Six million up front  But if you made  Five or six million bucks  And you know  Thirty years ago  If you invested it right  Alright you got a great life  After that  But I guess Don Mattingly  When Mattingly made  Nineteen and a half million  For five years  That was considered  An outrageous salary  So I imagine  Fidrich didn't get near that  Do you want to kiss me?  Fuck Joe  It was the button 
[01:04:30]  It didn't fit  But yet somehow  I'm okay with it  You wanted me to  Cover the buttons  I don't know what it said  I'm not looking at all  I'm not looking at all  That was just awkward  For everyone though  Maybe Mark  Owned that trucking company  Maybe that was his thing  Maybe  Maybe he owned the truck  Yeah maybe he invested  His money in that  You'd like to think he did  I loved that guy  When I was growing up  I'm like this guy's a lunatic  He yelled at the ball  He was a weird guy  Yeah look up some video  Of Mark Fidrich  If you care  Was he definitely broke 
[01:05:00]  Or was he just doing  The truck thing  To keep himself busy  I don't know financially  Where he was at  I'm not sure  He probably didn't have  A big contract  If he was a rookie  Maybe he signed  For a couple nice years  Then memorabilia  He probably  He probably did alright  For himself  He had signings  But that's why  Those guys charged to sign  People think they're being dicks  The older guys  Like when Demond  I never mind when  Those older guys charge  Because they never made  Fucking 8 million  Or 9 million dollars  In a year  And they were better  Than half of these  Douchebags playing now  Sure  Rookie year  He made 16,000 
[01:05:30]  Wow  Stop  Maybe  Hey rookie  Back in  What was that  1979  I'm guessing  I think he was  He made his comeback  In 82 or 83  Alright yeah  Late 70s  Late 70s  76  16,000  I was 8 years old  When that fucking guy  That's amazing  That's like the money  You make when you  Start doing comedy  It's the same thing  You have this idea  Of this business  If I can only get in  And make money  And then you make money  You're like  Oh really  It was $20,000  You know what I mean 
[01:06:00]  What is that today though  What does $16,000 say  Is there a way to look  Yeah I can find that  Convert that  Cause it's like  I'm guessing it's like  40 grand today  It still is a shit  I was gonna guess 45  Oh Joe  Let's not quarrel  I'm gonna guess  37,500  Really  I like that you threw  The 500  Come on Dan  It's amazing  Danny can pull up  Fucking like  If you mention like  A fucking  An African hemorrhoid  He's got a photo of it  In 30 seconds  But a simple math equation  I got no idea  Let's challenge Danny  With that one today 
[01:06:30]  African hemorrhoid  After you find the answer  To the Mark Fidrich question  That'll probably be  Way easier than this  That's what he was saying  I accidentally set  Grandfather's graveyard  On fire  In Japan  When he cremated  Family takes the bones  My friend was buried  In the wrong grave  You tell me which one  You want here Jimmy  My family has  Fights at funerals  I hate when they play taps  Let's go with the fights  Cause taps I don't mind  Taps is a military thing  Let's go with  Or cop  I don't mind taps either  Cause you're right  Military thing  It's when you take  The pop song 
[01:07:00]  That you know  It's gonna bring  Everyone down  Yeah taps is respectable  We had funeral home  Cut man's legs off  Because he was too long  For a coffin  That's a good one  That's uh  Yeah cause you don't  Want to wreck up  The cemetery  Of the cemetery  That's an episode  Of Tales from the Crypt  I don't  You're not buying it  No  Alright let's find out  That's an episode  Of Tales from the Crypt  Jack South Carolina  Hey fellas  Welcome aboard Jack  Hello Jack  This is your best show  Yet in the new studio  I just want to say  But anyways  Hey listen yeah  This guy died  He was 6 foot 7 
[01:07:30]  This happened in  Allendale South Carolina  So you can look it up  6 foot 7  And it turns out  That the casket  That they bought  Wasn't long enough  So unbeknownst  To the family  The funeral home  Cut his legs  At the ankle  And at the calf  And just put his shoes  On his feet  And then buried them  And then had the  Had the funeral  And everything  And then buried them  And they  Exhumed his body  Back in 2004  They just exhumed his body  And it turns out  They cut his legs off  So he would fit 
[01:08:00]  In the casket  Why'd they exhumed  The body  Who gives a fuck  And the name of  The funeral home  Was the cave funeral home  And they did it  Because  Well I guess  It's like  Desecrating a body  Or something  You know what  You can get him  In a box  And fucking  Throw dirt on him  Is there  Is there a worse  Sentence than  Exhumed the body  Every time you hear  About a body  Being exhumed  Yeah  And you see  Like the backhoe  In a cemetery  Some guy's been dead  For 30 years  And they need to  Exhum the body 
[01:08:30]  Yeah  The cow's a preacher  Anytime they exhume  A body  They're looking for  Traces of semen  Or something  I have the answer  And now this guy's  Just throwing out  Weird facts  Guy's a preacher  Yeah  Alright  Thank you sir  For calling  And a democrat  Alright  We buy it  It wasn't a task  From the dark side  He had bunions  He's now walking  Around like a goat  Alright  Can we go home  Now please  How much was it Dan  Well according to  This inflation calculator  16,076 would roughly  Be about 60,000  In 2008  Okay  Whoa  That's still shitty 
[01:09:00]  Because right now  Thanks to Travis  Traipsing in  Minimum 2008  Baseball salary  390  390,000  390,000  Is the minimum  You can make  Thanks to the  Fucking baseball union  Yeah  Jesus Christ  Can we go with  The exhume the body  A little more  I just need to  I don't know  I don't know  Where to go with this  But  Well one body  They should have  Exhumed  To shut a lot  Of people up  Or maybe they didn't  Because they didn't  Feel they needed to  Was the Kennedy body  I mean  Because there's rumors  Now  Because there's always  Like what happened  To the brain  Of the president  Where is it  Right  And then there's rumors 
[01:09:30]  That there was another  Private service held at night  Where they said  Bobby Kennedy  Allegedly put certain  Things in the casket  And they think  That that was  Parts of the body  Like the brain  And things like that  But they could  Exhume the body  I'm a Catholic  In the Catholic faith  Don't you have to  Have the whole body  In there  Well maybe  Because it was  Blown apart  Or the  There might have  Been a reason  Yeah  Well the body  Was in all  Sorts of labs  Disarray  Yeah it was here  And there  And everywhere  Wait  Wasn't that the book  That Bilbo Baggins wrote  Wait a minute 
[01:10:00]  You said Bobby Kennedy  He put pieces  Of the brain  In the  No  He allegedly  Placed something  In the casket  With Jack  You know  With the immediate  Family  There's a private  Service held  For the immediate  Family  They had a look  At the brain  And stuff  But who  Who gets the job  Of exhuming  The body  Oh  Corner  And then you have  To open that  The horror show  That is facing  After that  That's all mummies  Are  Exhumed bodies  We're just 
[01:10:30]  Digging up  People's relatives  And sending them  Around the world  And going  Look  Look at this  Thing wrapped up  A little more  On Fidrich  For the sports fans  That was  The family  Owned the  Trucking company  So after  Fidrich  You know  Stopped his  Baseball career  He had to move  Back to the  Family farm  And the  Family business  Yeah dude  He had such  A talent  Proves there's  No god  Didn't coach  Why would he do  That to Mark  Fidrich  All we want to  Do is pat his 
[01:11:00]  Mound and talk  In the ball  Maybe god  Did him a favor  Maybe he was  An average talent  And god gave him  One good year  To now go fuck  Yourself  You'll get under  A truck in 30 years  I like how you  Spin it  Now do you think  I have a question  For the two of you  Sure  Do you think  That exhuming  The body  As you asked  Who gets to do it  And you say  Coroner  Do you think  The coroner  Dreads that  Like dude  This isn't gonna  Be good for anybody  Or do you think  He's like dude  You never get to  Fucking do this  We're gonna dig  I think they get excited  I think those creeps  Enjoy it 
[01:11:30]  And by the way  You know why  It's worse than a mummy  Because a mummy  Isn't in a Sears suit  That's a good point  Mummies have  Wrappings and gold  Things  They look old  And like you can't  Connect to them  You can't relate  To a mummy  They look like  Your fucking  Uncle Murray  Same socks  Mummies don't have socks  You assume the body  And the guy  Has a Mets cap on  It's a bit creepy  Yeah  Well look  At least the suit  Held up  Yeah  That's a good shape  Still  Right  Alright 
[01:12:00]  They should bury you  In fucking  In like  What's the word  Biodegradable clothing  Because it is creepy  That the clothes survive  And you don't  Like the suit  They put you in  Will survive  For a thousand years  I mean there will be  Some remnants of the suit  There on your skeleton  It's fucking creepy  You exhume the body  Of your uncle  And he's in a  Saturday night fever suit  Because  Because it was in  When he died  Or something  Out of a coke overdose  At Studio 54  Yeah  Right  One pinky nail  Is a little longer 
[01:12:30]  Than the other ones  The other pinky nail  Just keeps growing  Longer than the other ones  Right  Yeah that is weird  They should buy  They should just bury you  They should just  That's a  Fucking bury you naked  Why are they  Bury you in anything  Why are they wasting  A suit  That's just gonna  Sit in the ground  Because you don't want  Your relative  To be cold  To be cold  Alright  Well you get the weird thoughts  Like you know  First day at range  You're like oh great  In a graveyard somewhere  Getting wet  Yeah I guess you know 
[01:13:00]  Are we done with this  Morbid topic  I  It's weird  I wanted to go with  The songs a little more  And we had a few  But they had to hang up  Some of the songs  That we play  To make sure we're  Even sadder than we are  I wanna be cremated now  I'm so claustrophobic  That's what my pops went for  Oh that's smart man  It's weird though  Because like his bones  Were like  His bones went one way  He always wanted to like  Donate his body  To science  But by the time he died  It was like  You know  He's older yeah  The only thing they could

[01:14:00]  I'm not believing  I have body image issues  So I certainly get it  Let's go to Scott in Boston  Scott  Sorry Joe  That's okay  I'm thinking  Jim C might have  Exhumed a few bodies  God damn  Why didn't I think of that  I don't know  If Jim C's around today  It's amazing  Do we have Jim C around  I always get a kick  And I'm digging them up  And bringing the family in  Why would you bring the family in  Jim C  Because they get sad  Sam  Imagine the clueless coroner 
[01:14:30]  Bringing the family in  Like oh you gotta check it out  You gotta check out  What has happened to the body  Since we buried it  Jesus  Just no clue  It's amazing  All this coroner talk  And I didn't  I forgot Jim C existed  We're still getting used  To the new place  It's the new studio  I don't think they've done  Ted yet  A little Jim C today  I've done one Ted line  We'll get there  Three days  You know my new bit  For Twitter  Is finding  Ted  Ted  Businesses

[01:19:30]  After you die  Like meaning  What they do  To cure it  For the ground  Nope  You have no idea  What you could do  With someone's body  After it dies  They actually use them  In car crash experiments  You know  We've all seen  The car crash dummies  There are people  That will write off  And allow  Their dead relatives  To be used  In car crash experiments  There are some people  That are used 
[01:20:00]  To try out new makeups  After you die  Alright  Which is creepy  For the person  That has to put the makeup  On the dead person  But they're trying out shit  There are people  That will allow your body  To be shot at  Shot at  After you die  That's a good one  I would donate my body  I'm trying to remember  The rest of them  Body farm was another one  Where they  You know  Throw you in a field somewhere  And see how you rot  And stuff  So they could like  You know  Figure out shit  I'm trying to remember  Those were some 
[01:20:30]  Of the better ones  What was the makeup one  I don't even get  Would your body  Even have the same reaction  To makeup  I don't remember anymore  But yeah  Something to do with makeup  And the body  Yeah  Or is that for necrophiliacs  You can  This makeup works  This doesn't smear  On the corpse  You can dress her up  Nice and pretty  Yeah  I got it figured out  By the way  You got the picture  Figured out  No no no  I'm not even taking  A picture Joe  I'm not even taking  A picture  I'm checking my email  You're just checking  Your email right now  See look  Look what I just did 
[01:21:00]  For you Joe  Okay  I can't see it  All natural laughing  Nice  Having a good time  That's the one  I'm gonna  Send to everybody  Thank you  Thank you  Oh sorry  I wanted to hear  More of what they do  To the body  That's all I remember  If anyone else  Read the book stiff  Maybe they could help me out  With a few other things  They do with the dead body  Why are we so morbid today  Would you do any of those  Anthony's at a funeral  That's why  Yeah  That's how I got started  Would I do any of those  What when I go  I would donate my body  To one of those  Yeah  I don't really give a crap 
[01:21:30]  What happens to my body  After I'm done  Do you believe in heaven  And all that shit  I don't know man  I think there's  I don't think it's been  We shouldn't maybe go down  This road today  Because we actually have  What the big guys  Coming by today  I hear  The new archbishop  Of New York  Is he  Or the cardinal  What is he called  The cardinal  Yeah right  We're not allowed  On that side of the  Floor today  There's a whole thing  Going on  We can't go over there  The new cardinal  We were told  To just not have  Any shenanigans 
[01:22:00]  Planned for  The new cardinal  For what  New York City  How far does his  Power go  That I'm not sure  I think it's just  I think it's just  The New York  Cardinal  Security is on high alert  To keep the ONA crew  Away from the new cardinal  We're not going to fuck  With the cardinal  Jesus  There was memos  And everything  No joke  Right Danny  We're not allowed  On that side of the building  When he comes in  In another hour or so  Yeah I think it actually  Starts right now  Seventh  I think he was  Is he over there  He might be  I think it was  7.30 on  Can we get some of that 
[01:22:30]  God stuff into our lives  By just looking at him  What happens  Dude  I went full fledged atheist  As of like  A month ago  I finally just accepted it  Really  And it's scaring the shit  Out of me more than anything  Really  I like to think  That we just haven't  It hasn't been explained  Properly yet  That's my  That's my new thing  Yeah  That's a nice way to do it  I'm not a big fan  Of the organized religion  In general  Now  But I just think  There's  I like to think  There's something 
[01:23:00]  But we just haven't  Really explained it yet  Actually Norton said  Something once  At the cellar  When I  Jim when I first  Moved to New York  It was one of the  First times I ever met you  You said something  That made so much sense  And it freaked me out  So bad though  You were like  I believe when you die  You just become energy  And you just go into  You know  You release energy  Like anything  That's decomposing wood  You break down  And your energy  Releases into the soil  Or whatever  And that was it  And that was the most logical  At that point  The most logical  And scientific explanation 
[01:23:30]  I had heard of it  As far as like  You know  Sort of finding  Some sort of medium  Between a soul  And being released  From you or whatever  And actually what could happen  And that's  That's what started  Or that was one of the things  That sparked my atheist  Route  And now I'm full  I'm full on  Just atheist  Great  Because of Jim Norton  You're gonna be  You know  You're not gonna be able  To live in eternity  That's smart  Nobody meets Jim  And goes  You know I wanna find God  I wanna go  Actually maybe they do  Or they thank him  But they're not me  I don't even know 
[01:24:00]  Where I stand on God  I'm not an atheist  I'm not an agnostic  But I'm not really  I don't know  I mean I pray  I don't know  You don't pray  I do  You do  Nah  Not often  But  I do the OM  OM  You meditate  Joe  I don't know  A little yoga yet  No yoga  Did a little yoga  No yoga  I like  I like the yoga  I think I might start  I should do something  I like  I got this guru  She's like  She was part of the original movement  And one 
[01:24:30]  That is a story I told  But one  One yoga session  I found myself  On my back  With my bare feet  On her huge  Warm  70 year old boobs  Oh  It was very comforting  Was it?  Yeah  You liked it?  I didn't like it  Because of a sexual feeling  I was getting  It was just very  Mothering and nurturing  It was very nurturing  Yeah  You didn't get turned on  A little bit  Like in a creepy dark place  I was impressed  As far as how firm  The 70 year old boobs 
[01:25:00]  Still were  Very impressed  I'm getting it  And they were very warm  Very warm Joe  You're kind of fucking  Making me tingle  A little bit right now  I want to feel  The 70 year old boobs  I gotta be honest  It was nice  Like Jimmy's saying  In a nurturing way  I don't know  What's appropriate  Like I got a  Thai massage  A while ago  Yeah  And that's when  You lay on the floor  And you know  Thai massage  She'll kind of  Put her foot  On your side  And stretch your arm  It's really a good massage  And it's not  A sensual massage  You're dressed 
[01:25:30]  You actually have  On shorts  Or sweatpants  Or whatever  But like  The moments  Of body contact  Like I'm always  I'm such a sexual  Fucking creep  Like I don't know  What's appropriate  Body contact  What is appropriate  Contact between people  That is not sensual  Not sexual  It's almost like  If she leans over  And her breast  Would touch the back  Of my arm  I'm like  She means that  To happen  That's something  Oh really  Dick Hardy  I'm such a  You're just working  It the whole time  In your head  Yes  It's like  Instead of realizing  That during  A legitimate massage 
[01:26:00]  Occasionally there's  Going to be  A contact  That's not  Sexually intended  The massage  For me  I find it weird  That you don't  Know this person  They're a complete  Stranger  They come into the  Room  And next thing  You know  They're rubbing you  That's always bizarre  To me  Yeah  Because you can't  Do that at work  You can't all of a sudden  Just start touching somebody  Right  Well  I mean  After a while  Maybe you start  Shaking someone's hand  Or giving them  The hand  You know  Chest bump  Or something  But out of nowhere  Like you meet the person  And you're pretty much nude 
[01:26:30]  And they're rubbing  Your entire body  For the most part  Well there's a  That's very strange to me  There's an agreement there though  Yeah there's an understanding  I understand  Yeah  You know  If somebody at work  Said give me a massage  You can give them a fucking massage  But your space is pretty sacred  You know  You know what I mean  You don't allow many people  To move into that space  But as far as getting massaged  Like yeah go ahead  Do whatever you want  I went  I went one time to one  I mean they'll just put their hands  All over your shit  They don't even  You know  And I got off the bus  I was taking the bus back  From Philly one day 
[01:27:00]  And I hadn't showered  And I had swamped  I just stunk  And I called my buddy up  I go dude  We're going  We're going to the fucking geese  Right now  Like I'd just gotten that evil  Like let's go  And we went in dude  I took my pants off  I could smell my stink  And this chick  Played with my asshole  And beat me off  And did all of it  Like the soldier she was  She a hooker?  I tuned out of that story 
[01:27:30]  Not  It was a Yankee Joe  It was a Yankee Cranky shop  And he wasn't  Yeah yeah  He wasn't properly  You know  Groomed for it  But no here's what it was  Not that I wasn't  Listening to you  But I looked at the cover  Of the Daily News  It was Timothy Dolan  Who's the new archbishop  Right  And I just was thinking  To myself  Do you call him father?  Like I don't know exactly  What would you call the archbishop?  Would you call him  Yes sir  Yes father  I don't know what you'd call him  And then I got brought back  Into it when Joe goes  And I had cranky ass  And she was playing  With my ass like a soldier  I'm like wow  I went away for a second  And really missed something 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  Let's  Call him your eminence  By the way  Oh is it your eminence?  Yeah  Let's go to Eric in Jersey  Eric  Thank you Heathen  Yeah they were doing  Plastic surgery on the bodies too  Boob jobs and nose jobs and shit  Oh they do that too?  Okay  That's all I got  Thank you sir  I mean say hi to Josh in Tampa  Josh  Hey  Hey  I had gone for a perfectly  Legitimate  Reflexology treatment  Where they like massage your foot 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  And they're able to tell you  That you dislocated your shoulder  And things like that  Because my wife was reviewing the spa  And I fell asleep  And you know  When she woke me up  I had definitely cum in my shorts  You made cumzies?  Wow  Yeah  Reflexology works  A little embarrassing  What toe did she put the pin in  To make that happen?  That's fucking worth it  Wow  Cumzies  Oh yeah  We like that term here  That's great  One more from  What's your name  In Boston? 
[01:29:00]  Elise  Elise  How are you Elise?  Good  Good  What do you got?  Well  I did read that book  Stiff  That you had mentioned  Yeah  She  She actually wrote about  Well basically  When you donate your body to science  What  What are the things that  They could possibly do with it?  So I actually  If I remember correctly  The families didn't know  What the bodies  Were being used for  They just know that 
[01:29:30]  Their loved one  Wanted their body  Donated to science  So  Oh is that  Oh is that the deal?  So when you  I kind of  I think something's  Going around today  Because I checked out  Of your phone call  For a second  So when you  Give your relative  To science  It's a general thing  Right  So you don't really know  Exactly what they're  Going to do  So my dad could have been  Part of some cool thing  Maybe  Right  I don't want to know  What they did to him now 
[01:30:00]  You hope that that's what it was  You hope it was part of a cool thing  Right  You don't want to think  That he was just  Thrown in the trunk  Because they want to see  What happens  During damp temperatures  Yeah  So they can check out  For murders and stuff  But that's what  Half those bodies  Want to be  Having done to them  You know I know  Thank you Elise  I know DeRose is a fan  Of Bill Hicks right  Yeah  Yeah  I kind of hear a little  Bill Hicks in your act  I mean you're  You're an original  Don't get me wrong  But I see the influence  When I see you  And I like it a lot  Actually  Yeah  We should play  The Bill Hicks bit  Where he talks about  You know  Donating your relatives 
[01:30:30]  To like action movies  And stuff  At the end of their lives  You ever hear that bit  You know what  No I haven't heard that one  I don't know  What the name of it is  I think it's off  Relentless  I think  If we could find it  Really fast  It would be a good way  To go to break  Basically saying  Look instead of  Watching your relative  Like rot away  Wouldn't it be cool  To like have your grandma  Or something  In some kind of action movie  That's funny  And they completely  You know  Take out grandma  In that way  That's a cool way  To go out  Yeah  I mean I'm just  You know paraphrasing  The entire bit 
[01:31:00]  But it's a nice little bit  I like a lot of the Hicks stuff  A lot of it's really  It still holds up  That's what amazes me man  I have never listened to him  But it's not to be a dick  Or to be different  I just don't want to be  Influenced by him  Because by this point  In my life  I haven't heard him  So I don't want  It's like  I don't want to  All his stuff  I've heard he's great  Relentless is a great place  To start with Bill Hicks  And is it a shock  By the way  That our black friend  Is now 16 minutes late  Keith Robinson  Will be joining the program  I don't know  Ah shit  I had stupid traffic  God damn it 
[01:31:30]  Yeah  Do we have that bit  See I need to see  The guys in the booth  Oh Travis  He's got his middle finger  Up at you  It's like dude  Just look for the bit  The uh  Okay  Yeah go ahead Joe  Yeah the uh  We  What the  You just said  About Bill Hicks  The uh  He is  He is  Like he is a very  Infectious guy  You know what I mean  Like he was the  I first started listening  When I first started  Doing comedy  And he was one of  The first guys I heard 
[01:32:00]  Because I was such  A Carlin fan  But Hicks did  Like the Carlin thing  But he did it  In like the sort of  Sort of alternative  Comedy approach to it  Where it was very  Conversational  And it wasn't monologuish  You know what I mean  It sounded very off the cuff  And that was  That's what's so  Infectious about him  Because he  For me at least  I was like wow  You can really  Go to these certain places  And talk about like  Weightier shit  But also do it  Just very like  Whatever man  I'm just fucking  Talking about this shit  And it's not gonna be  That threatening  I'm just gonna tell you 
[01:32:30]  What I think  And I'm gonna put it out there  If you don't like it  Fuck off  Or whatever  To me that's what  Great alternative comedy  By the way should be  Is that what you just said  It's like  Not necessarily being  Monologuish  Or whatever  But it's just kind of  Whatever  Talking  To me that's a good  Definition of alternative comedy  Yeah I agree  I agree  Yeah once it starts  Getting into like  The realm of like  You know pie charts  And all that stuff  Or just phony  Detached irony  I like the thought  Provoking comedian  At times  And Bill Hicks  And there's a few guys  Like this  Where you hear just  Dead silence in the room 
[01:33:00]  Because everyone  Is listening  Like they're really  Listening to what  He has to say  And then the jokes  Still come  That's  Yeah  I love that  Well that's the best  Thing that I've found  About a lot  I've been doing  Some more of those  Quote unquote  Alt rooms  In between the clubs  And the best thing  I found about those  Crowds is  They will stay with you  You could do a  Five minute bit  That leads up to  A funny closing  But in that  Five minute bit  There's periods  That aren't supposed  To be funny  And they'll hang in there  And they'll stay with it  A lot of club audiences 
[01:33:30]  As you know  You know  They're like  You know  I've done those  Same bits in clubs  Where they're like  Get to the point bro  And you're like  Dude seriously  You can't just  Fucking listen to this  And like  Go on the ride  That's the ADD crap  But is it  And again  I've done some of  The small rooms  Like that too  Which I kind of like  Yeah  My problem with  Alternative rooms  Is they tend to be  Too politically hypersensitive  They tend to be  Very politically correct  Which annoys me about them  But the club audience  Is saying  Get to it  At times means  They're impatient assholes  But is it 
[01:34:00]  Way of saying  That the joke  Needs to be  Gotten to faster  Because I'm  Like  And I'm not saying  Your bit was bad  But I look at a guy  Like  Alright Pryor  Pryor worked out  In clubs  And Pryor always  Like you'd wait  For Pryor sometimes  Because  You'd always wait for him  But you knew  He was getting  To something  Really fucking funny  And he never  Made you wait  That long  Like he'd make  A couple of points  And he'd hit you  With something really funny  And then he'd make  His point  He had a great way  Of fucking  Of coming in  And hitting you  Often enough  That you didn't  Lose interest  Right 
[01:34:30]  Right  Yeah well  It's you know  It's certainly  The balancing act  Of that  But I always liked  And of course  I'm not  I'm not Carlin  Obviously  And I haven't  Had that career  But I mean  I always liked  I like how you  Had to explain that  Yes  Well I'm just  Always so scared  That I'm gonna  Say something  That people  Misinterpret  As you think  Yeah yeah  I hear John  We know you're  Not Carlin  Stupid  Go ahead George  What are you  What are you saying  Go ahead  Go ahead Lenny  Yeah I gotta get 
[01:35:00]  This out before  Keith gets in here  Cause he's calling  In and saying  He's annoyed  At what I'm saying  Right now  Keith is annoyed  At Jim and Joe  Well fucking  Where is he  Alright cool  We should  Finish it though  Cause we gotta  We do have to  Hit a break here  I was just gonna say  I just love how  On those specials  He'll go five minutes  And just be like  This is what we're  Talking about here  It's a point  That I'm making  And then  He jumps back  You know what  We're not gonna  Get the break  Cause Keith is  Marching down the hall  And he is like  Ready to roll  By the way  Bert and Philly  The premise  On the Bill Hicks bit 
[01:35:30]  Terminally ill  As stunt people  Yes  Okay  That's  Hey Keith  Hi Keith  Are you just annoyed  Are you annoyed  Already  It's making me sick  Go ahead Keith  Keith Robinson everyone  Yeah well  By the way  First time on our show  In four years  The fact that you're  Talking to Joe  About great comics  Makes me want to  Throw up  Ask Joe about  How it is  Driving Bill Burr around  That's what you  Need to know  Oh well  Carl when you see  You make me  That is the worst  Conversation I've ever  Seen  You getting annoyed 
[01:36:00]  By it  Oh it was infuriating  I was punching the air  I was so angry  And Joe  You know  And how you let him  Skip over Richard Pryor  Cause Joe  Does not like  Richard Pryor  No that's not true  You've been hanging  Shut up with your  High pitch voice  You've been hanging  That over my head  For five years  I like Pryor just fine  I like Pryor just fine  Name one of his  Bitch stupid  One of them  Mudbone  Oh  You know what  That's  That's the one  I'm a windmill  Kick him right out the chair 
[01:36:30]  Mudbone  Alright go with two  My father died  In your pussy  I don't know  That fucking bit  I'd be in that long  Motherfucker Jack  I know all the  Fucking prior bits  Dude  I have  Was it something I said  I have  That  He's shaking  He can say it  I have  Live on the Sunset Strip  I have  Here and Now  I have  Live and Smokin  Either way  We want you to stop  You want to talk 
[01:37:00]  Let's talk great comedy  But not with you stupid  I want you to stop wearing those sweatshirts  Not with Joe DeRosa  Jesus Christ  He has the body of a Somalian pirate  He stinks  He's out of breath  Cause he was running down that really long hall  To give you a beating  Oh it just infuriated me  Listen to Jim  Sitting back like Bill Moyer  Going over  Going over  I was trying to discuss it like a gentleman  Yeah  Trying to be a true gentleman  Well Joe  I see that you  In alternative rooms 
[01:37:30]  And Bill Hicks  But in alternative  The thing is  The point is  In alternative rooms  At times they'll give you a little bit more time  Sometimes you know  A club audience  Can be fucking  Like you are trying to get to something  Or you're doing something  That's like a little bit paced  And they get impatient  Alternative comics stink  A lot of them  No not a lot of them  All of them  They stink  Anybody that puts themselves on an alternative  Has to stink  But it depends on what you call alternative  Like a guy like Hicks  No but Hicks was  To be  Was Hicks an alternative  He wasn't no damn alternative comic 
[01:38:00]  He wasn't  He wasn't  He didn't call himself an alternative comic  He was out there doing what he was doing  That was a comic  It was a comic  That was when no one labeled their comedy  They just went up and did their thing  Well I still don't think they should label it  But stop labeling comedy  You know why they label it?  Because they stink  You have to have an excuse for not being funny  And that's what it is  But that's not true  A lot of those guys are really funny  Who?  Oh for Christ  Really?  We gotta get into this game now?  If you're not gonna get into it  Shut up  Patton Oswalt's a great example 
[01:38:30]  He's hilarious  Oh shut up  And he's one of those guys  Patton Oswalt stopped being funny in 88  Oh  I know everybody's quiet  But I said it  Shut up  Take it  We're gonna take a break  We got Keith Robinson  Keith you playing the Stress Factory?  Yeah I'm at the Stress Factory  Yeah I'm annoyed  What is  Honda Sykes headlining?  Yes she is  Yes  She is headlining  No it's me  It's just me there with I don't know who  7-3-2-5-4-5  When?  Tonight?  Ha-ha  Or all weekend?  I don't even know 
[01:39:00]  It was like some emergency  Somebody  Good old Vinny  Good old Vinny  Oh Vinny fired somebody?  I don't know what happened  J.B. Spoo was supposed to be there  What did Vinny get all angry at somebody?  Yeah  Oh great so it's gonna be fucking Keith  With a room full of angry Curb Your Enthusiasm fans  Who the fuck are you?  You're not J.B. Spoo  I do  Oh yeah I know  Yeah yeah yeah  Oh  Oh that would make me happy  If nobody knew you were gonna be there  Right for fucking J.B.  No why would I have  I wouldn't be on here  If there was  Loaded with people  No it must have not been enough people 
[01:39:30]  All right we'll figure it out  So we got Keith Robinson  Stress Factory  We got Joe  Where are you again Joe?  Comics tonight right?  Comics tonight  And I think we're going to break  With that George Carlin bit  We're gonna give it a shot  The one you referenced  About cemeteries  How he thought cemeteries were outdated  Yeah let's see if this works  And we'll continue  O.B. and Anthony  Without Anthony today  He's at his grandma's funeral  Because people are wondering  I've got just the place  For low cost housing  I have solved this problem  I know where we can build  Housing for the homeless  Golf courses  Perfect 
[01:40:00]  Golf courses  Just what we need  Just what we need  Plenty of good land  In nice neighborhoods  Land that is currently  Being wasted  On a meaningless  Mindless activity  Engaged in  Engaged in primarily  By white  Well to do  Male businessmen  Who use the game  To get together  To make deals  To carve this country  Up a little finer  Among themselves  I am getting tired 
[01:40:30]  Really  Getting  Tired  Of these golfing  Cocksuckers  In their green pants  And their yellow pants  And their orange pants  And their precious little hats  And their cute little golf carts  It is time to reclaim  The golf courses  From the wealthy  And turn them over  To the homeless  Golf is an arrogant  Elitist game  And it takes up  Entirely too much room  In this country  Too much room  In this country  It is an arrogant game 
[01:41:00]  On its very design  Alone  Just the design  Of the game  Speaks of arrogance  Think of how big  A golf course is  The ball  Is that fucking big  What do these  Pinheaded pricks  Need with all that land  There are over  17,000 golf courses  In America  They average from  150 to 200 acres  A piece  That's 3 million  Plus acres  4,820 square miles 
[01:41:30]  You could build  Two Rhode Islands  And a Delaware  For the homeless  On the land  Currently being wasted  On this meaningless  Mindless  Arrogant  Elitist  Racist  There's another thing  The only blacks  You'll find  In country clubs  Are carrying trays  And a boring game  Boring game  For boring people  You ever watch  Golf on television  It's like watching  Fly's fuck  And a mindless game  Mindless  Think of the intellect  It must take  To draw pleasure  From this activity  Hitting a ball 
[01:42:00]  With a crooked stick  And then  Walking after it  And then  Hitting it again  I say  Pick it up asshole  You're lucky  You found the fucking thing  Put it in your pocket  And go the fuck home  You're a winner  You're a winner  You found it  No  Never happened  No  No chance of that happening  Dorko  In the plaid knickers 
[01:42:30]  Is gonna hit it again  And walk some more  Let these rich  Cocksuckers  Play miniature golf  Let them fuck  With a windmill  For an hour  And a half or so  See if there's really  Any skill  Among these people  Now I know  There are some people  Who play golf  Who don't consider  Themselves rich  Fuck them  And shame on them  For engaging  In an arrogant  Elitist  Pastime  Hey  Here's another place  We could put some  Low cost housing  Cemeteries 
[01:43:00]  There's another idea  Whose time has passed  Saving all the dead people  If for one part of town  What the hell  Kind of a medieval  Superstitious  Religious bullshit idea  Is that  Plow these motherfuckers up  Plow them into the streams  And rivers of America  We need that  Phosphorus for farming  If we're going to recycle  Let's get serious  Thank you  Thank you 
[01:43:30]  I appreciate it  Checking out the  Opie and Anthony show  Got a full house today  We got Joe DeRosa  To my right  And we got Keith Robinson  Who came in here  Very angry  I walked in  I walked in  Because the Archbishop  Is being interviewed  Down the hall  So we went  Me and Opie  Went down to look at him  Just to watch him  He's a bright dude  He's you know  Yeah  Giving a good interview  And I'm going to try  To get him in here  To talk for a few minutes  But I don't think  It's going to happen  That ain't happening  There were memos  They want us to  Stay away from the guy 
[01:44:00]  We would give him  A good interview  We would give him  A great interview  I have some very good questions  I wouldn't fuck with the Archbishop  Maybe if I say it like that  There's no way to get him  Yeah you can't say  I wouldn't fuck  But I really wouldn't  I would ask him  Legit questions  So he's the most powerful  Catholic in New York State  New York City  I think  Manhattan  I don't know man  Midtown Manhattan  No he's St. Pat's  Which is the  You know the biggest  I think Catholic church  Hence why they want us  To stay away from the guy  We have a little history  With the St. Pat's thing  Yeah  They're still paranoid 
[01:44:30]  I don't know  I mean Bill Donahue  I would love to ask about this  Because he knows  I want to know  How powerful this guy is  Jim you say  What questions would you ask  The Archbishop  Give me one of your questions  Okay  What is the line you would draw  With the Catholic church  Between a kind of  Holding true to what  Your morals are  And what made you what you are  And changing with the times  Like  Certain things have to change  With the times  And how much of the moral  Structure is like  Okay it's got to be this way  Because it's been this way  For centuries  And how much of it 
[01:45:00]  Should you change  To changing times  Where you're not selling  That your  So you would ask  The Archbishop  Does he Twitter  No  I'm sure he doesn't  Speaking of that  Jimmy  I took a picture  You didn't take the picture  So now I'm going to  I'm going to tweet the picture  Of the big powerful Catholic  Nah he's all over the place  I mean I would like to get  A photo with him  I'm going to run down  With my camera  Yeah but you're not going to see  A blurry picture  Like the one I took  Through double glass windows  And security  And paparazzi  And cameraman  If you look through all that 
[01:45:30]  You get a little glimpse  Of the guy  You know what I mean  That's why I'm great  At the tweet  I would get yelled at  For taking a picture with him  But I still would  Oh I was  I would like to see  Take a nice swing  How great it would be  If I asked for a photo  And he put his hand  In my face  And said I'm busy  And he mushed me  I would love it  I couldn't even  What are you going to say  Are you going to try  To get a picture  With the guy  Nah probably not  He's uh  He might be the Pope someday  You never know  Yeah you know what  That's a good point  All of a sudden  Things happen  And when you get  A picture with the Pope  He won't be the Pope  They never have an American Pope 
[01:46:00]  Nah you're right  They don't  Joe is actually  Yeah but maybe  The times are  Times  He's young too  I mean  He's probably  What's he 60  Or in his 50s  He's not like  Yeah you know what  He's probably not old enough  To be Pope  You probably have to be  Farther along in the hierarchy  By this point  Like you have to  Probably already be  In fucking Rome  Um  I wouldn't curse  If he was here  But you know  Fucking Rome  But I'm saying  That's probably  You probably already  Have to be in the Vatican  By this point in your life  That's true of your eminence  Is it true that you have to 
[01:46:30]  Be in fucking Rome  Yeah that's really  Not going to help us  As far as getting the guy  In studio Jim  He's uh  Well Cardi Ligon was uh  77  So I want to know  How old is uh  He's 59  He's 59  How old are you  Before you become Pope  They want you old  When you're Pope  Because they don't want you  Around for that long  Like they don't want you  To have a 30 year run  Of the Catholic Church  They don't  They want you to be  Kind of in a transient position  Where you're not the boss  For 30 years  You get too powerful  And you can affect it  Too much  So they seem to want 
[01:47:00]  Very very old guys  For that reason  Jim kind of knows  A lot about this  I like that  Yeah we like this  Yeah I wouldn't ask him  Stupid questions  But  And I don't think that  Guys like that  Don't mind answering  Those questions  Because they understand  That in a lot of ways  The church and religion  It seems irrelevant  To a lot of people  It's like how do you stop  What do you do  To stem this whole tide  Of it seeming irrelevant  To a lot of younger people  And it is  They're gonna  It's like anything else  They're gonna eventually  Crack on a lot of these issues  They're gonna change their  I guarantee within 10 years  15 tops 
[01:47:30]  The Catholic Church's stance  On homosexuality  Is gonna be completely different  I don't think so  I do  Oh no  They're losing too many people  They're not gonna have  They're not gonna change  The scriptures  Just for  To accommodate  Gay marriage  Stupid  But they changed them  Alright  The Second Vatican Council  In 1962  Changed everything  And it was by  Decree of the law  Is that a real thing  No  Yes  Yes  So they rewrote the scripture  No but  Dude  Like for instance  A man shall lay with a man 
[01:48:00]  For instance  The scriptures say  You can never eat meat  On Friday ever  And that's gone  That's completely gone  Now that was because  It was the Old Testament  Stupid  That was when you  You can't live no longer  By Old Testament rules  I don't know if they're gonna  Change scripture  You obviously can't do that  But  A lot of it's up for interpretation  Like  The way you look at it now  Like the way they interpret it  In the 15th century  Is different than the way  They interpret it now  They interpret it much harsher  Than  And the penalties  And the punishment  So it's like a lot of that stuff  Is up for interpretation 
[01:48:30]  And there's a lot of  Religious documents  You can't misinterpret  Men should not lay with men  There's no way to go  I wonder what they meant  No but  There's gotta be other things  In there that would balance  It where someone could go  No this is what he meant  You know  They have so many ways  Of interpreting what Christ said  Or what was meant  Exactly  Exactly  How about they just use the facts  That it was passed down  Orally for  40 to 100 years  Before any of it was written down  Oh right right right  Yeah it's true  The bible 300 years after Christ's death 
[01:49:00]  Was a bunch of  Most popular stories  In the church put together  There's a lot of writings  That aren't even in there  Yeah  Well they decide  Which ones to be in there  That's one of the problems  I have with the church  They got rid of a lot of stuff  They're like  No one needs to see  These stories  And Tom Hanks  Is gonna get to the bottom of it  Right  In his new movie  My brother is a bishop  Of a church  You talk about the archbishop  Let's talk about my brother  The bishop of South Philly Church  Yeah  Yeah for real  Keith's brother is a bishop  He's a bishop  And that really annoys me  That you have turned out  To be such a piece of shit  You have a holy man 
[01:49:30]  In the family  You know  He was in an accident  A car accident  The other day  It was a really bad accident  And I guess he was saying  You know that  The ambulance was passing him by  It was a little racist  But what happened is  We didn't know  Is that  His car was hit pretty bad  But he couldn't breathe  But he was outside the car  Doing Tai Chi  So the reason that  The ambulance was passing him  They see a guy  Doing kung fu moves  To the air  And he was like  Oh it's nobody hurting  And they were just 
[01:50:00]  Pulling past  Why was he doing the Tai Chi  Just to calm his body down  Breathing exercise  Just to try to get some air going  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  That Tai Chi's weird though  Because it's all  I don't get the Tai Chi  That's like meditation  But you're moving  I don't know what it is  But he's  Doing like karate moves  Doing karate moves  And a big wreck  And the ambulance  Like oh  It's just a good  Yeah it's just some nut  Who fucking  Doing kung fu moves  It is part of becoming a bishop  That's part of the training  You gotta do the Tai Chi  Some Tai Chi  So is he against gay marriage 
[01:50:30]  Yes  But there are people in the church  Like there are like  Whether it's priests  Or like the more liberal  Factions of the church  That sanction it  And say it's okay  It's almost like  There's gay priests allowed  And a lot of other faiths  Right  So it's like  Those faiths are not  Completely ignoring  Because no religion  If you look back at it  Like over the years  Has said homosexuality is good  Or whatever  So there's ways of interpreting  Where they say it's okay  Like you know what I mean  Like I don't  How are other faiths  Allowing it  Well  We're saying it's cool  You're gonna get the chance 
[01:51:00]  To ask him  Because here he comes  Down the hall  No he's not  I made you look dumb  You fucking certainly did  I'm like am I sounding smart  Maybe he's listening to the show  Maybe he's a secret ONA fan  I can see the hall  And I fucking look  That's how dumb I am  I'm like where  Where  You saw the empty hall  Before you looked  I'm throwing you Joe  Hey when we  I walked in  I'm sorry  I walked in  And Keith and Joe  Were going at it  Yeah  That's why I said to Joe  Why don't you go look at the bishop  Why were they going at it  I don't know  If this alternative comedy  Oh you're still on that 
[01:51:30]  Well it heats me up a little bit  You know  Because it's never happened  You know in school  You didn't have alternative  Funny guys  You didn't look over  To a room of silence  To see a bunch of guys  Being quiet  And you know  They're just alternative  Right  The funny guys  With a funny guy  Funny's funny right  Back of the bus guys  Be fair Keith  Nobody argued that point  You got all hot  When I said  That doing those rooms  In addition to the clubs  Has made me a better comic  And you said that  That was bullshit  Well one would debate that  You said that was bullshit  That's fair  I mean that's a ridiculous thing 
[01:52:00]  To combat  I'm playing different rooms  And it's helping  But you're saying  Alternative comedy rooms  Just doing different rooms  Made you funnier  Stupid  Not the room itself  Not the alternative comedy room  Different rooms  Fine  The rooms where  That type of show  Is happening  Help me out  I mean  Joe I've been funny  All my life  You think I'm gonna allow you  To come here  With your awful body  And tell me about funny  Why are you getting so mad  Because Joe  I've been a thug nigga  Since I was a rug nigga  Back of the bus nigga  Hand on the trigger  But I didn't shoot 
[01:52:30]  From the hips  I threw from the shoulder  Until I got older  See  You feel that right  Oh that was beautiful  I was angry  I was angry  But I liked the way  You danced around with that  And put a cute smile  On my face  Well I gotta say  In Keith's defense  It's not even  It's like back of the  The back of the bus guys  Is a great description  Not in a tough guy way  But just in the fucking guys  That were just kind of  Being assholes  Sitting in the back  Fucking teasing everybody else  Those are typically  And the guys that run comedy  Or in the decision making  Are the guys 
[01:53:00]  The nerds  That kind of sat in the front  But Jim  In all fairness  And I know you're a fan of the man  Woody Allen is certainly  Not a back of the bus personality  And he's hilarious  But Woody Allen's thing is  Woody Allen is just  Nothing but fucking  Like I mean  And he's one of the greatest  Joke writers ever  He is  Joke after joke  After joke  Woody to me  Is like what an alternative comic is  Like because he was so alternative  To what everybody was back then  It was like  Take my wife please  Look at that  The kitchen  And then Woody came up  And he was Jewish  And he was nebbishy 
[01:53:30]  And no one was doing it  But he was an alternative comic  Yeah he didn't label it  Stop putting  Don't put Woody Allen  In the category of alternative comics  This is where you're wrong though  This is where you're wrong  How  Because I have a book  Called Seriously Funny  The Rebel Comedians  Of the 50s and 60s  And they talk specifically  In that book  About how Woody Allen  Mort Sahl  Don Rickles  Phyllis Diller  And fucking so on  Were the alternative comics  Of the era  Because they started to play  The rooms  Instead of the cat skills  Because they thought  The cat skills stunk 
[01:54:00]  Wait a minute  They never called themselves  Alternative comics  Well just because  They used the word  Well why you use the word then  Because that's what it's called now  Who gives a shit  What changes this  I give a shit  Because I'm a comic  It's morphed into where  Good quiet  It's morphed into where  A lot of people  But it's like  You're getting caught up  In the term alternative  It's morphed into where  A lot of unfunny people  Hide under the moniker  Of I'm an alternative comic  Whereas a guy like Woody  Was brilliantly funny  And he was just alternative 
[01:54:30]  To the style that was happening  Back then to me  Alternative was more of a style thing  And it wasn't where  Certain people who aren't funny  Made their excuse for not being funny  By saying I'm alternative  Woody was funny  You know what I mean  It's like  I agree  Just don't label it  It's like you go up there  And be a comic  Be funny  Right  Just go do what you do  I'm not a fan of labeling  All that crap  I'm not a fan of the theme comedy show  Either by the way  No it's terrible  Where you get three Italian comics together  And they have a cute name for  Joe was on the Egyptian tour  I believe 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  Did you do some of those  I do Arab American shows sometimes  Yeah  And it's a theme show  Well it's  They'll have Arab American comedy shows  Where it's  I'm sorry  I'm sorry Joe  Okay it's okay  I'm sorry too  That I sink that low  To make a buck  Speaking of comics  Let's move on to the  Jamie Foxx thing  Oh yeah man  We can go back to the alternative  Comedy argument  Anytime  No problem  Yeah Foxx was on  Leno  Leno  And he was apologizing  For the Cyrus thing 
[01:55:30]  The Miley Cyrus thing  This isn't our wheelhouse obviously  He doesn't want to apologize  But he's got a big movie coming out  I don't blame him for this one  He's like  He's an Oscar winner  He's like  There's too much money at stake  He's like  Ugh  Cares  You know the  You know the controversy  He's thinking as an actor  He's thinking as an actor  I think it's no big deal really  Calling her what  A white bitch  He didn't call her a white bitch  Someone on the show did  Right  Yeah they were just being funny  And he's like  He's like fucking  You know  He was talking about her big gums  It was you know  Just shit talking 
[01:56:00]  And getting chlamydia  From the bicycle seat  Or something like that  Yeah it was fucking funny  Solid  You gotta rap it  He's gotta rap it  Eminem would be great at that  And he wouldn't apologize  Yeah  Right  Yeah  You gotta give him some lines for  But we understand  What this is about  With a big movie coming out  He's like  You know what  I'll just make this go away  There's no reason  To apologize for this stuff  When we said it a million times  You're hanging out  With a bunch of dudes  Well in his case  There's a girl on the show  And you're just trying to be funny  And entertain the people  Plus you don't mean anything  By this shit usually  You don't want to jam your middle finger up at Disney 
[01:56:30]  Which is basically what that's doing  Because there's too much money for him  Because Jamie  I will probably never make money  Doing Disney work  He will  He's a guy that can make fucking  Fifteen million on a Disney film  Why would he say  Basically go fuck yourself  To one of the biggest stars  It's stupid  Alright let's go to Leno  And see what Fox said last night  I think it was last night  Yeah I think he apologized last night  I gotta ask you something  Yo  I was reading some stuff  Now what's going on with you and Miley Cyrus  What happened there  Did you say something inappropriate  Yeah 
[01:57:00]  Yeah  I so apologize to  Yeah  And this is sincere  Because I am a comedian  And you guys know  That whatever I say  I don't mean any of it  Right  And sometimes as comedians  As we do  We go a little bit too far  Right  I have a radio show  XM 149  Foxhole  106 on Sirius  Right  Now we're really the black Howard Stern  And so you know how 
[01:57:30]  We go at everybody  But there was a  There was a situation  With Miley  Miley Cyrus  And I just want to say  I apologize for what  I said  I didn't mean it  Maliciously  And you know  I'm a comedian  I know I know that  You know that  I know  You know my heart  I know you  No I know you're a good guy  So what can I look into the  Miley I apologize  So I'll call you  No see I think that's  That's sincere right  That's true  I mean  I mean  And as a comedian 
[01:58:00]  And I got a daughter too  And you know  And so I completely understand  And this has really been bothering you  This has really bothered  Because I'm a comedian  I don't want to  Do I lose my comedic license  Or can I keep my comedic license  You know okay  I'm gonna  I'll put it down as a warning  But yeah  But on the real  I want to  But I want to nip it in the bud  Because what happens is  Is that  What we do on our radio show  Is completely blue  But what they do  They pluck it off of the radio show  Then they play it on the internet 
[01:58:30]  And they make it seem like  Out of the blue  I said these crazy things  About this younger  And it's not like that  So I want you guys  To nip it in the bud  When you see  The TMZs  And the  You know all of that stuff  You know  Just hey  It's just jokes  Smart guy  Because he heard that little  I'll tell you what he was worried about too  Is that one of them  Did say that white bitch  Right  And he just knows  That that can blow up  And become a fucking mess  Right  He's not a dummy  I got an email  From my brother overnight  And he makes a really good point here  About this thing  He writes 
[01:59:00]  A little venting  He says  I haven't heard what was said  And I probably would find it humorous anyway  But I'm irritated by the  Jamie Foxx  Miley Cyrus thing  This is what he says  His nine year old daughter  Is asking questions about it  Alright  Not because she heard it on an obscure XM channel  But because it's being repeated  All over the freaking media  Over and over again  Because they find it  Quote shocking  It was truly shocking perhaps  If it was truly shocking  Perhaps they shouldn't be exposing it  To all the young fans  Who would not have heard anything about it 
[01:59:30]  And that's one of the problems  We have with the media here  You know  They go on and talk about  How shocking something is  As they play it over and over  And over again  Exposing it to so many more people  That would have never heard this damn thing  Well David  David Cross used to have that thing about  Like when  When the Columbine shootings happened  Right  And they were saying  It's because of violence in the media  And he was like  That fucking Columbine footage  Was violence in the media  You showed them  Pulling that body out of the window  A million times  Over and over  He's like  That's violence in the media  But I don't know man  I kind of 
[02:00:00]  Look  I guess he did what he had to do  But there was something  A little weaselly about  I mean  I don't want to say he's a wease  That's the wrong word  But like  If that's what it is  Then it's like  Fuck it  That's what it is  He didn't do it  You know what I mean  Like  And I guess you gotta play ball  Cause he's got this movie coming out  Like you're saying  You can hear he's playing ball  But it's like  If he didn't have a movie coming out  I bet you he would have handled that  A little differently  Yeah  I really think  Well he knows what it is  It's like again  There's a way  There's a line between  Where you're going out  And you're saying  Fuck you  And then you're backtracking  And then there's a line 
[02:00:30]  Where you just get caught up  In a conversation  And it's like  Look  He has a movie coming out  He's thinking as an actor right there  It doesn't bother me  His apology  It really doesn't  Well you know what  Because I would too  In his position  I wouldn't  Well yeah  I got nothing to lose  But  He's an Oscar winner  He's got millions of dollars at stake  It's stupid not to  I mean I won  I was up for star  So it's 100 grand  I have plenty to lose  But I  Molly Cyrus bugs me  Yeah  She annoys me  So if I wanted to say  Molly Cyrus annoys me  She annoys me  What's that  The Jonas Brothers  They really bug me 
[02:01:00]  With their promise rings  Oh my god  I wish Michael Jackson  Was at the height  Of his pedophilia  Just so he could  Take him to the  Take him to the magic room  Wipe out three little memories  In one swipe  And Miley Cyrus is going to end up  Going down the same road  As Britney Spears  Of course  Eventually right  She already did  She already took those  Like half topless pictures  She's just getting started  Yeah  I think she's older  We're talking about  Mean  Doing a little heroin 
[02:01:30]  To the veins and stuff  She's going to go all in  I'm thinking  Did Britney do a little heroin  I don't know  You wouldn't apologize  No I would  No  No  Not at all  I would probably  Of course you wouldn't  I would dig myself  Deeper and deeper  Yeah  Keith just  Blows up his spot  Wherever he goes  Yeah  The publicist  And go look  You don't want to say  You're sorry  But you didn't have to  Call her an ugly  Little white bitch  Again  You didn't have to  Add ugly to it 
[02:02:00]  Keith Robinson's  A really funny guy  But not a smart dude  Not at all  I'll tell you why  Because he had a great  Appearance on our show  A great one  Where we're like  Oh my god  Let's make him a regular  Like the rest of the guys  We would love to have  Keith as part of this  O&A thing right  His last appearance  Was February 16th 2005  And how many times  Have we asked you  To do the show  A lot  I can't even count that high  The thing about it man  I'm an eccentric businessman  I fly  You're not a businessman  Keith is a fucking  You just don't want to  Drive from Philly  Keith is a bum 
[02:02:30]  That's what's keeping you  A little drive up the turnpike  I'm horrific  I admit it  But if you had more  Prostitutes here  I would really  Make an effort  Wait why don't you  Start getting some more  Whores in here  Because Keith is a  Fucking old school pig  Yeah I need more  You go old school  I love whores man  I'm you know  It's my thing  Yeah  A nice whore  Skanky or  Nah just a  A prostitute  It just feels good  Street corner  Craigslist  Craigslist  I've been  You know  I read Craigslist  Like the  Daily news  Every morning 
[02:03:00]  Get up and look through  To see who's new in town  Just visiting  Just visiting  Looking for a generous friend  Is that great  New in town  New in town  I'm excited  I start to shake  When I see new in town  Fucking  Is there anything worse though  When you see like a really hot ad  And then you see the same ad  With just a different picture lower  And you know  That some agency  Putting out the ad  You're like god damn it  That one seemed really genuine  That's right  Bill Donahue is available now  You want to talk to him  Yeah let's ask him a quick question 
[02:03:30]  I would like to ask him real quick  Alright  Well we do have the archbishop here  Yes  We're not going to get him  Yeah  Look I mean there's security  Like preventing us  From going down certain hallways  They're so paranoid around here  Yeah  We'd actually give the guy  A good time  Yeah  Get a couple whores in here  Queue up two girls  One cup for the man  Bishop you're an old school pig  Right  Jesus  Just like Keith  Wow  Sorry just a bad lead in  To the guy we're about to  Yeah he's ahead of the Catholic league 
[02:04:00]  Yeah but he loves  He loves his drink though  So go down that road  People get mad at us  I'm not going to say a fucking word  Bill Donahue  I don't want to be the guy  Who gets everybody in trouble  People get mad at us  Because we like this guy now  Like a lot of the fans  Get angry  Is he on?  No I'm still holding a grudge  I'm not at all  I think you're alright with him  I think that's sort of okay with him  Yeah  I hold a motherfucking grudge  Keith can understand that right  I feel you man  You being real  I wandered the earth for two and a half years  I believe because he really 
[02:04:30]  You know pumped up our situation  My grudge is against the old management there  Who knew the deal for real  And reacted in a way  Instead of saying no no this is what it is  Alright here he is  He didn't stick with us  Hey Bill  Hello Bill  How are you?  How's everything going guys?  Well we got the head guy  Here at Sirius today  Archbishop Dolan  Is he the archbishop?  Is he the cardinal?  We're trying to figure this stuff out  He's the archbishop  He's not a cardinal yet  That'll probably take place 
[02:05:00]  I don't know  Maybe a year  Or less than a year  What's the difference?  What makes him a cardinal?  You have bishops in certain cities  And if it's a big city  In a big state  You have an archbishop  But there's only about 10 cardinals in the country  That's like the higher rung so to speak  So I mean an archbishop  You could be an archbishop of Denver  Like Archbishop Chaput  But he's not a cardinal  The cardinal is like  That's like the top rung  So New York being New York  Obviously at some point 
[02:05:30]  He will be a cardinal  Sometime within probably a year  Bill can we talk in like sports terms  Is he still in the minor leagues?  Is he like a triple A player?  Or is he now in the majors?  Sounds like he's majors  Let me tell you something  I met him twice yesterday  I'd spoken to him before  I worked with him in 2007  In the fall of 2007  When I took on the Miller Brewing Company  I hate to go after any kind of an alcohol company  Because I'm very pro-alcohol  But I did go after the Miller Brewing Company  Because of a vile anti-Catholic gay event 
[02:06:00]  You know guys having sex in the street  That's the kind of stuff these guys do at these events  And they also took crucifixes  And used them as sex symbols  Had a stripper  And a guy dressed as Jesus  Hoisted by a crane  In a cage above a Catholic church  Guys dressed as nuns  You know that kind of stuff  So I said to Miller  I want an apology  For four specific anti-Catholic incidents  And I got one  I said no I need three more  Suffice it to say that in six weeks  After a boycott 
[02:06:30]  And Chaldean Catholics in Michigan  Throwing the beer into the streets  And I sent pictures of all these guys  Performing oral sex on each other  All over Milwaukee  The pride of Miller  To churches and mosques  And synagogues and civic groups  And finally they got the message  And Dolan was fantastic  He told the Miller boys  Donnie is not going to give up  I'm on his side  This is outrageous what you're doing  You've got to stop this sponsorship  And so we won  So when I met him on the steps of St. Pat's yesterday  And then over at the reception 
[02:07:00]  I was very happy  To be with him  And I'm happy that Daily News  Will run a column by me tomorrow  Talking about  This guy  I mean he's not from New York  But you would never know it  He strikes me as if he's been  New York his whole life  This is Keith Robinson  Are you like the Al Sharpton  Of the Catholic Church?  No I should pay my taxes  Now Bill we saw him  He's being interviewed today  Down the hall  We can kind of hear 
[02:07:30]  Some of his interview  They're putting it out  Over the speaker  And he seems to be a very bright guy  You know what are the odds  Of us getting him in here  In the studio  And having a chat  If we were nice?  I don't know  I'm going to be meeting with him  And he told me yesterday  That's going to happen pretty soon  And I'm going to work closely with him  I think he's a great guy  I can mention it to him  I think that you guys  Would be respectful  I'll tell you one thing  He's tough skinned 
[02:08:00]  And I don't think he's afraid  Of the media  And I think you're going to see  Him be more vocal  More out of the mold  Of O'Connor  So I wouldn't rule it out  Well that's all good  Does he have a sense of humor though?  He has a great sense of humor  I mean I know you guys  Are a little edgy  Which doesn't bother me  I don't think it would bother him  Per se  But you know  Somebody over there  Where he's at  At the headquarters  Might say well you know  Opie and Anthony  Shock jocks and whatnot  So I can at least  You know drop it  In his ear 
[02:08:30]  We're not going to do edgy  Let's put this out there  We're not going to do edgy humor  With the archbishop  I like working here  There's no way  To do edgy humor  With the archbishop  But I would have some questions  I would like to  Ask Bill  Bill knows all this  He could beat me up  No no no  Not even nasty  Because Keith's brother  Keith  A comedian friend here  His brother's a bishop  In Philadelphia  And also does Tai Chi  Yes and does Tai Chi  Which is apparently  Not a very good driver  Which is really smart  If you're in a car accident  But we were saying like  Jesus 
[02:09:00]  We were talking about  The catholic church  I mean  I said Jesus  To build on you  That's alright  I feel bad  He says it a lot  I would like to ask  The archbishop  About the catholic church  Where's the line  You keep between  Alright remaining true  To your principles  And your values  And all the things  That you kind of think  Are right  And bending a little bit  Or changing a little bit  To stay relevant  Do you know what I mean  Without considering  Yourself selling out  Like it's like  Something with gay marriage  Or homosexuals  I think that  You know 
[02:09:30]  The idea of being relevant  Is really of little interest  To the catholic church  After all  If it's survived  2,000 years  As one assistant  To a cardinal  Told Napoleon  He said  If you think  You're going to destroy us  You'll never do it  After all  Look at all the popes  And cardinals  And priests  That we've had  Have been incompetent  Over the last 2,000 years  But Bill  If they haven't destroyed it  You're not  I gotta say  Just interrupt you  For one second  And then I'll let you  The passing of information  Now is so much different  And you have to admit  In the last 50 years  The church has taken  Some tremendous hits 
[02:10:00]  Which I mean  Probably more damaging things  That like  Became public knowledge  And became apparent  To a lot of people  Than it happened  In hundreds of years  Combined before  Well listen  There's no question about it  The scandal rocked the church  It was a disgrace  The way it was handled  By some of these bishops  And certainly  Some of the monster priests  That we've had  But fortunately  There's just a few  Of those kind of priests  That we've had in the past  Most of that damage  Was done in the 60s  70s and 80s  But look  The thing as far as  Gay marriage 
[02:10:30]  There's no way  In the world  A Catholic church  Is going to say  Tom and Dick  Get married  Because then Harry  Wants to get in  And make it a trio  And they're not  Going to do that  They're not going to  Ben on gay marriage  Because Bill  This is Joe DeRosa  Who?  Exactly  That guy's  Oh you're expecting  Something  No I just was  Keith did it  So I did it too  Bill just  Some people confuse him  For being George Carlin  So just to bring it  All together  For real  Everybody turns on you  All at once  Joe's a comedian 
[02:11:00]  Friend of ours  I don't understand  You'd think the  Catholic church  Will never approve  Gay marriage  Because you think  It means that  A third man  Will  Is that what  You just said  I'm sorry  That's Bill Donahue  And his sense of humor  Joe  No I was just  I didn't understand  I was just  Let me put it to you  Very clearly  Here's the way  It works  Okay  You can't  The whole purpose  Of marriage  Is not about  The man  It's not about  The woman  It's about  When they procreate  Which means  Vaginal intercourse  That's the only way  It works folks  Nature says  The man and the woman 
[02:11:30]  Have a nice  Goodness of fit  Okay  To use a statistical term  And then  When it works  Then you have children  Children need  A stable environment  They don't need  Two fathers  I mean after all  We have Mother's Day  Coming up  So what do you say  To the little kid  And when you believe  In the politics  Of inclusion  Now you've excluded  The kid on Mother's Day  And then in June  You'll exclude him  From Father's Day  If he has two mothers  No the way it works  Is you have to have  A father and a mother  And they typically  Will have children  And we're not going  To change on that  Just because 
[02:12:00]  Our country  Has gone delirious  When I was a kid  If somebody said  Two men should get married  Somebody might have  Want to call 911  Get the asylum ready  Get out the straight jackets  Because these people  Have flipped  Now we have a governor  And a mayor  Who are just as nuts  As the people  Used to be in the asylum  Bill don't forget  Just because  In fairness  When you look back at it  Like sometimes  The older times  Like if you say  When you were a kid  Just because that's  The way it was  Doesn't mean that  It wasn't incorrect  Because when you were  A kid also  You know blacks  And whites drank  At different water fountains  It's like sometimes  Things have to kind of change 
[02:12:30]  And when you talk about  Nature doesn't change  No no no  Nature doesn't  But sometimes  Our interpretation  Of what's proper  Of what's proper in nature  Could change  Like when you talk  About a kid  I agree with you  On one thing  Like when it came  To gay adoption  I was like  Well I don't know  Is it going to damage  The kid at all  To have two dads  Or two moms  Yes  Will it?  I don't know  I don't think  There's been enough  Case history to show  Yes or no  It will  But how about  Families where  There's alcoholism  I mean there's so many  Dysfunctional and bad  Regular mother father  Situations  Could 
[02:13:00]  Let me tell you  Where the damage  As  Look  When you grow up  As a kid  Any kid  Hasn't grown up  With his father  Wants to know  Where his father is  So if you have  A situation  Where a person  Like a woman  Can't teach a man  How to be a man  A man can teach a man  How to be a man  So you know  I mean  In that case  Like you got two women  Raising a boy  That never going to be  Able to give that kid  The instruction  That he should have 
[02:13:30]  Have you seen  Lesbians  One of them would  Take that role  Believe me  Lesbians  One has a mullet  You can't take that role  Listen my little cousin  A woman cannot be  A father figure  Hold on  That's true  My little  My little  My little cousin  Was just  Was just born  Her parents  Were  Had drug issues  Okay  She was  The custody of the child  Was taken away  Upon birth  From the parents  Because they were  Incapable  And are still  Quite frankly  Incapable of raising  This child  She went to a  Lesbian couple  They're doing a  Tremendous job with her 
[02:14:00]  They love her  They're thrilled  It's brought meaning  To their life  And to insinuate  In any way  That this kid  Would have been  Better off  With two drug  Addicted parents  That were not  Capable of raising  A kid  Versus two women  That actually love  Her and are capable  Of raising her  It's crazy  Yeah but you don't  Make social policy  Based on the exception  And by the way  It wasn't just in the  1950s that we had  Marriage between a man  And a woman  It's been that way  For thousands of years  The only people  Who think it's good  For gay people  To get married  Are white people  Who are well educated  In the United States 
[02:14:30]  In Europe  And in Canada  Don't try that talk  In the Middle East  Don't try it in Africa  Yeah well they're very  Reasonable over there  Don't try it in Asia  Because they know better  And I'm on the side  Of the non-whites  They're a lot smarter  Than the white people  When it comes to marriage  But don't forget though  Over there though Bill  Culturally there's so many  Other different things  I mean they happen  To agree with you  On this one issue  But when you look  At their treatment of women  Well come on  They're removing clitorises  In a lot of these places  They're not good examples  Of socially you know  Relevant people  I'm not going to go along  With that kind of savagery  Obviously 
[02:15:00]  But I'm just  Any kind of female mutilation  I'm not even big on tattoos  We had a marriage story yesterday  What it was  An eight year old  Yeah like in Saudi Arabia  Marrying some 50  Something year old  The court has said  They will not  They will not  Stop the marriage  Of the older man  To the eight year old  As long as he promises  Not to have sex with her  Until she's pubescent  It's like  I mean so if you're  Going to raise  The Middle East  As kind of a barometer  Of morality  Or of proper living  You have to take  Other stuff into consideration too  I gave you most of the world  I didn't just choose  The Middle East  I'm not going to  Let's not forget 
[02:15:30]  Let's not forget  About the rape demonstration  Yesterday too  Where the women  Were like protesting  They don't want to be  Raped anymore  And then the guys  Were there throwing rocks at them  Yeah it's awful  Women that's not that bad  In all fairness  Bill you did also mention  Communist China  Where they take your babies  Away from you  And  To have most of history  The idea of two men  Getting married  Is a positively  An insane idea  Up until somebody  Rolled out of bed here  About 20 years ago  And I'm not sure  What side of the bed 
[02:16:00]  And with whom  And decided this would be  A good idea  And most Americans  Don't want it  As a matter of fact  Even in New York State  The Quinnipiac poll  Showed that only 41%  Of New Yorkers  Wanted it  Not even a majority  Of the Democrats  Want it  So why is  Patterson trying to  Force speed  And shove it down our throat  This idea that  We have to have  Gay marriage  We have a mayor  Who's out of touch as well  They do not represent  New York  And in 30 states  Where this has been  On the ballot  The scorecard folks  Is 30 to 0  I'll tell you why  30 to 0  I'll tell you why  I think it matters Bill  Because I think in our country  The minority voice 
[02:16:30]  Has to be protected  To a certain extent  Like  They shouldn't have to win  They can have their free speech  I don't think it affects  The rest of society  I think that if people  Want to do that  And live  I think it is their business  And I think it's  It's so weird  Like  I want less government  And it's amazing  The conservatives  Typically are less government people  But they want more government  When it comes to  How people live their lives sexually  And it's amazing  How it's not  They're live and let live  With most things  But when it comes to that  They want a little bit 
[02:17:00]  Of government intrusion  And if people want to get married  I mean  It's basically  It should be their right  Because  But you're acting like  As if we don't even have a society  That we don't have a moral consensus  That we all go about  Willy nilly  Making up our own minds  You guys couldn't get to work  This morning  Unless people agreed  On what a red light means  I mean  We have to have a consensus  You don't have to have unanimity  But you have to have a consensus  You just can't go around there  And say  Well different strokes  For different folks  We have a 13th amendment  Which forbids me  From owning somebody as a slave  Yes  But I  It's not just up to you  What you want to do  In every case 
[02:17:30]  Not in every case  But I think  When it doesn't affect other people  There you go  I don't think that does  When it goes to the children  I just gave you an example  What are you going to tell the kid  On Mother's Day next month  When he has two fathers  Well Bill  Like you said  You can't set policy  Because of the exception  You said that  And because of  An American holiday  Father's Day and Mother's Day  Twice a year  You can't  It's not just that  They banned Mother's Day  And Father's Day  And some of these  These hippie  Well I don't agree  With that either 
[02:18:00]  You're right  I don't agree  With that either  Of course not  You can't make fathers irrelevant  You can't make mothers irrelevant  Of course not  No that's what you  When you argue the point  That's what you do  You've got to understand  The importance of a father  And a mother  And you can't lower that  For your own gain  You have a point  You have a point here  You have a point  With some of the stuff here  When I was a kid  Mother's Day  Was my favorite day of the year  Never mind Christmas  Or any of that stuff  If I didn't get to celebrate  Mother's Day  No kid gives a shit  About Mother's Day 
[02:18:30]  They just don't  That's wrong  They don't  That's completely wrong  Look I do  I love my mom  And I buy her something  On Mother's Day  But no kid is going to be  Sitting there going  Why don't I get to  Celebrate Mother's Day  The kids just don't get  And Jim to call back  A point you made earlier  About the separate water fountains  There was a time  In this country  When the majority  Of the country  Thought that blacks  Were not equal  And blacks acted  Against nature  And blacks shouldn't  Be allowed to raise  Children at all  And have freedoms  And all this stuff  And the reason  That ended  Was not because  Of the majority  It was because 
[02:19:00]  Lincoln as the president  Put his fist down  And said it's over  I'm vetoing this  Race versus behavior  It's not a good analogy  Look a vegetarian  Is defined by what he eats  He eats vegetables  A homosexual  Is defined by what he does  And we know what he does  Yeah but Bill  The whole thing is  The racial argument  That people make  Like when I said  To you about  The separate water fountains  And your point was  Yeah but that's not  Nature  But the argument  Being used  To keep blacks separate  Was basically the same 
[02:19:30]  Well they're savage  They won't interact properly  People were using  That argument  They were saying  That it was based  In nature  White people are  Of a different nature  Than blacks  And then the more  That became ridiculous  And obviously incorrect  You know society changed  And I think  That's the point  Obviously a nature based  Difference between  Male and female  If we're going to  Try to say  That that's a social  Construction  Then we really do  Have to call the asylum  But is it  Science to me  Has not proven  Conclusively  Whether or not  You're born  Let's just say 
[02:20:00]  For the sake of argument  If you could just  Say this  Let's just say  That people are born  Gay  Now a lot of people  Think it's a choice  You make  They're not born gay  But let's just say  That someday science  Proves that Bill  Just to play devil's advocate  Would you at least  Have changed your feelings  Ed if you realize  That people are  Actually coming into  The world that way  No of course not  Because again  The whole purpose  Of marriage  Is for the creation  Of families  Which by definition  Nature has excluded them  You know there are  Problems with nature  And with nature's god  And I don't think  Society should be  Working against 
[02:20:30]  What nature does  It should ratify  And take its cues  From nature  The fact of the matter  Is that a person  Who's homosexual  Is entitled to the same  Dignity and respect  As everybody else  But when it comes to marriage  You're tinkering  With an institution  And quite frankly  You better be prepared  Once you go down the road  Of saying Tom and Dick  Can get married  The state cannot have  There will be no principle left  Upon which you cannot say  Three people can get married  Whether it's polygamy  With gays  Or with straight  There's simply nothing left  Bill I have a question 
[02:21:00]  Because you keep  Bringing up nature  Where in nature  Does dead rising  From the grave  And the seas parting  And water turning into wine  And God speaking  Directly to people  Where does that all  Fall into nature  Well you're talking  About religion now  Which is different  From nature  I thought you were  Talking about human nature  No but we're talking  About the church's stance  On this  And you're bringing up nature  I'm just asking  Where in nature  Do these things fall  First of all  I wasn't giving  A catholic argument  I happen to be a catholic  I'm giving what I think  What I think is pretty much  Of a bio 101 argument 
[02:21:30]  That there are fundamental  Differences rooted in nature  Between men and women  And you know  We can go on like this  Larry Summers got fired  From Harvard University  For mentioning this  But he wound up  Now rooting the economy  Under Obama  So I guess you can get promoted  After you do something like that  But quite frankly  Anybody who made arguments  About you know  Race based differences  Those people were racist  I mean you're not a racist  If you acknowledge  That there are fundamental  Differences between a man  And a woman  And that only a man  And a woman  Can yield the family 
[02:22:00]  I mean this is basic  And now we're so caught up  With treating people equally  That we've lost  All common sense  No but you  Bill you have to say  You did mention nature  You did bring that up  You're saying the nature  And then you said  That homosexuals  Should be afforded  The same dignity  And stuff like that  Yeah  But then you said  You're tinkering  With an institution  Now an institution  Does kind of go under  The same subheading  To me as the  Black and white water fountains  That's a society  Type of a thing  That's a thing  That can change  In society  That you know  When you mention institution  To me that is 
[02:22:30]  Kind of covered  By the same thing  That would cover  The black and white water fountain  And not nature  I think what the best thing  To do in this country  Is to have a discussion  On why don't we  Just do away with marriage  No I don't think so  But I think  Wait wait  Give me a reason  Why we shouldn't  You know what  I can't give a good argument  Because marriages  They fall apart so quickly  What's that?  Because of children  That's why we shouldn't  Get rid of it  But that gets back  To my principle  I have a principle  I think you guys  Are going on feelings  And emotions  And you know what  I can't do  Well isn't that  What kind of makes  A principle though  Your feelings  And your emotions 
[02:23:00]  Kind of define  Your principles  Aren't they all  Kind of tied  To the same thing  You deal with emotions  You're talking girly talk  No we all have emotions  Come on  That's not true  Jim's a woman  Hold on  I resent that  You know  You already know  That I feel fat  Let me jump in  For a second  Mongo comes up  With a good point here  Talking about marriage  So Bill  You've got a sterile couple  They're sterile  They can't have kids  Should they be allowed  To marry  Absolutely  And I'll tell you why  Because they provide  For a ready reserve 
[02:23:30]  In the case of the death  Of the father and the mother  They can step in  And they can still be  A father figure  And a mother figure  Okay  And Nate  So you've got to have  That kind of thing  In reserve  Look  Why can't we just deal  With civil unions  Why does it have to be marriage  But you see  I knew once we went down  The road with civil unions  The next step  Will be  Let's go from third base  Right down to hallway  You know what's going to happen  We're going to have  A constitutional amendment  Probably about eight years from now  Which will make sure  That marriage is between  A man and a woman  Because you're going to  Finally push the American people  To the point where they'll say 
[02:24:00]  Let's see  We won 30 out of 30  In the states  And if you can't win  In California and Oregon  Hey folks  I guess it looks like  The American people  Don't want it  And they don't want it  According to the  Quinnipiac poll  In New York State  Two weeks ago  And yet we have these people  Trying to shove it down our throat  It's not like  There's a groundswell  Of people saying  We want two guys  To get married  It's just the opposite  These little totalitarians  Out in California  They had the referendum  And they're trying to get  The courts to rig it now  And say  We don't care  What the people want  This is really becoming  Democratic despotism 
[02:24:30]  But to me  That they're people  Who are fighting  For what they want  Like the fact is  These are people  Who are fighting  For the right to get married  It's almost like  The church  Who looks at marriage  As a very sacred thing  Or an important thing  The way marriages are going now  They're falling apart  At a horrible rate  And I think  They're going to do wonders  On gay marriage  Gay men  They have a great reputation  Of staying together  Don't they?  No, no  I'm not saying  That they have  Because they're men  I bet you gay women  Are probably a lot better  Because gay men are men  No  They're right about that 
[02:25:00]  But what I'm saying is  These are people  Fighting for the right  To get married  And I don't think  That their marriage  Divorce rate  Is going to be any worse  Than what's happening now  It's horrible  What are we over  50-60%?  Something like that  And you know that  So the polygamists too  They can make the same argument  Right?  People who want to marry  Different people?  No, I mean  Three people  I mean three people  Look, I don't think  You should be able  To marry three people  Again  Why?  Look, again  Are you close-minded?  No  And look 
[02:25:30]  This is where you get  Into the slippery slope thing  You should be allowed to  Why not?  I'm a princess  It kind of got you there  Look, it's a tough  It's a tough point to debate  You know he had it  When Jim used slippery slopes  Yeah, right  No  You're slippery slope  No, I know that  But to me  Just because I can't  Defend the point  About polygamy  Just because I would  Kind of go with you  On polygamy  And go  Personally, I don't care  About polygamy either  I mean, that doesn't bother me  If some guy in Utah  Wants to marry  Six of these maniacs  What about Sam and Sally?  They're brother and sister 
[02:26:00]  They have a twisted relationship  What about you?  Oh, the plot's just hot  Again  I don't know  Do we have the right to say  That they can't marry?  Look at British royalty  Bill, look at British royalty  There's been incestuous things  From British royalty  For centuries  If a brother and sister  Want to get married  Look, I don't care  I really don't  All right, let me tell you something  So we just let it all  Let it all hang out, man  Professor at Princeton University  By the name of Peter Singer  He says that bestiality  Is okay with him  He thinks it's okay 
[02:26:30]  For parents to kill their kids  Up until the 28th day  After the kid is born  But Fred and Fido  That's okay  Now, Dan Aykroyd actually said  I'm in favor of bestiality  Except for the fact  That I don't think  The door can give a consent  That's because  He's not smart enough  Like Peter Singer  Who teaches at Princeton  Who has indicated  That the door can give you  Some body language  Indicators that he can consent  I'm not making this up  I can show you the evidence  So we are going to go down the road  With Fred and Fido  Oh, Aykroyd's bored, huh?  But yeah, but you know what 
[02:27:00]  Just because  I said slippery slope  Because just because  There are those ludicrous arguments  Coming out  It doesn't mean  That the basic  Do men getting married  Is ludicrous  Well, to you it is  But it's actually something  That's been  Nobody's putting bestiality  On the ballot  There really isn't  There aren't millions of people  Who are for  Are there so much for the marriage  Or do they want the benefits  Of being married  Why shouldn't they get  The benefits of being married  Well, the civil union  Is just as good  Right, right, civil union  What's the difference, Bill  Between this  I'm sorry, Joe  What's the difference  Between a civil union  And a marriage technically 
[02:27:30]  I actually don't know  Well, it depends on the state  And what kind of perks  They're going to give  And the like  But I think  The idea is that  We still look  I guess what it comes down to  Is if marriage is special  It has to be treated  As a special thing in law  If it's not special  Then we can just have  Guys and gals  Who cohabit  Just let them get  The same benefits  Let the polygamists  Let the homosexuals  Let them all have  The same benefits  Bill, do civil unions  Give people partner benefits  And death benefits?  Yes, in certain states it does 
[02:28:00]  Okay, so  Would you say in most cases  That marriage and civil union  Are the same thing  With the exception  Of one being called civil union  And one being called marriage?  I think that  It's my understanding  That in some states  You're probably right  Or pretty close to be  It's not 100%  But it's pretty close  So basically  In this whole fight  People are just holding on  To it being called a marriage  I mean, you're making arguments  About nature  And what it says in the Bible  And what they are basically saying is 
[02:28:30]  We don't want it called marriage  We'll almost live with the fact  That they can have the same benefits  They can live together  Do civil unions allow for adoption?  Let me give you an example  What happened out in San Francisco  They had a question about this  And the archbishop was against it  And they said, listen  Here's the way we're going to resolve it  Any person who lives with another person  That has nothing to do with sex  That person can claim that other person  If he's a dependent  So that would mean  That a son taking care of his father  Could claim the father as a dependent 
[02:29:00]  Or a gay guy could claim his partner  That was a way to kind of neutralize it  Without it making it so  In your face  That this is a gay legislation  And it actually didn't exclude people  Like the example I gave  Where there's a guy  A 40-year-old  Taking care of his 80-year-old father  Otherwise he would be excluded too  Just because they don't have sex  What about adoption  Stuff like that?  Do civil unions allow for adoption?  No, that's a different question  Usually where you'll see one  You'll see the other  But those are different questions  But, yeah, listen  This is pretty serious stuff 
[02:29:30]  Because in 2007 in New Jersey  There was a Methodist-owned facility  Some entity  And they denied lesbians  To have their wedding party there  And they were threatened  And did lose their tax-exempt status  So people say  Oh, well, religion can still do what they want  They don't even know what they're talking about  If they are going to go down the road  To try and have the law  That will come later  The government will try to tell the religions  That you have to allow people to get married  Or you'll lose your tax-exempt status 
[02:30:00]  Look, Obama's already said  He'll sign the Freedom of Choice Act  Which, if it gets passed  I don't know that it will  But if it did  It could arguably close Catholic hospitals  Why?  Because if they don't perform abortions  They don't get any federal funds  I kind of have to jump back to your point then  But what you said  Being relevant is not important  To the Catholic Church  I think that in that case  It has to be important to the Catholic Church  And I don't mean it like  It's a business, man  But I mean it does greatly affect  The way they conduct themselves  And the way they survive  If that's what's happening 
[02:30:30]  If that's what we as a country  Or whoever politicians say  Then being relevant  Has to somehow be appealing to the Catholic Church  No, no  I'll give you an example  In the 1980s and 90s  New York City said to the Catholic Church  You have to have affirmative action for gays  And if you don't  We're going to cut off money  For your foster care agencies  And O'Connor said  I'll close the foster care agencies  I'll close the schools  I'll close everything  You're not going to tell the Catholic Church  What to do  And let me tell you something 
[02:31:00]  The bishops in this country  Will close the Catholic hospitals  And everyone will suffer  Before they're ever told  That it's a condition of receiving federal funds  It kind of goes against the religion, huh?  Yeah, but do you  Bill, do you really think  That's what Jesus would do?  Do you think Jesus would want it that way?  You'd turn away sick and needy people  To make a point?  That's pride, Bill  That's pride  And pride is a sin  Bill, that's an excellent point by Joe, Bill  That really is pride  One for Joe  One for Joe  One for Joey  I got the scorecard here  What's that, Bill?  What about the kid in the womb? 
[02:31:30]  You think Jesus would say  It's okay to kill the kid?  No, but you want to talk about  Different issues  One for Bill  That's a different issue  No, it is  We're talking about  We're talking about  A Catholic hospital being told  That as a condition  Oh, okay, okay, okay  Yeah, no, I  I agree  If it's an abortion issue  That's one thing  But when we're talking  We're talking about  I can understand a Catholic hospital  Saying we will not take federal funds  And perform abortion  Like, I don't agree with that  But I can understand  Why they would be that strict about it  We're not saying that belief, though  That's a belief  I'm talking about  Let's stick with the issue 
[02:32:00]  Of gay marriage  And things like that  Do you really think  That, like, when Cardinal  Because you said  Didn't Egan say  Or O'Connor say  Go ahead, we'll close all the  These things  If we have to have gays forced on us  So let's stick with that issue  Do you really think  That Christ would want  These institutions closed  Knowing the type of rebel  That Christ was  And the fact that he was  Bucking society  Do you really think  That he would want  These helpful institutions closed  Well, I've never seen  Anything in the Bible  That talked about homosexuality  That wasn't opposed to it  Particularly in the Old Testament 
[02:32:30]  So I think that, you know  You may have to write  What about it?  What about adultery?  I mean, why don't we just  Keep open-minded about things?  So the Catholic Church  Takes its teachings  From the Bible  And the Bible's pretty strong  On this, fellas  You can't bring particularly  Old Testament into this  Second Vatican Council  In the 60s  Basically made the Old Testament  Irrelevant  And declared that all of it  Was figurative talk  And metaphor  And all that stuff  And they were stories  No, no  The Catholic Church  Has never rejected  The Old Testament like that  I went to Catholic school  For 12 years  And that seemed to be 
[02:33:00]  A pretty common lesson learned  I think you fouled  That one off, Joe  Yeah, you fouled that off  Bill, what's your response  To that?  Because I don't know well enough  But it sounds to me  Like you're really giving up  To give up here  To give Joe an answer  He's going to give Joe  A good beat  Yeah, I find it hard to believe  Joe, I've got to be honest  I don't want to agree with Bill  But I find it hard to believe  That Catholics have said  The hell with the Old Testament  We don't need that  No, no, no, no, no  No, no, let me clarify  How long have you been  You went to Catholic school  For how long?  My whole life  My whole life  My father's in the clergy  How long have you been  Dealing with Catholic school  Catholic  Hold on a second 
[02:33:30]  Hold on a second  If I did not phrase that  As eloquently as I should have  Then I apologize  I'm not saying the Catholic  I don't mean to say  The Catholic Church  Has disregarded the Old Testament  What I'm saying though is  It was taught to us  Frequently throughout  Catholic school  Mainly in high school  That Adam and Eve  For example  The story of Noah's Ark  All these things  In the Old Testament  These tall tales  Oh, it was bullshit  No, they said basically  Look, these were things  That were embellished  To describe the act of God 
[02:34:00]  They are not taken as literal  By the Catholic Church  Any longer  Fundamentalists  Fundamentalists  Take them as literal  Okay, so you can't  Bring the Old Testament  And that's a point  That Jim was making  About changing with the times  There was a time  When the entire Catholic Church  Believed that even  The Old Testament  Was literal  And then when that  Started to be thought  As insane  By the majority  Of the public  Then all of a sudden  You know what guys  That part's not literal  That part's figurative  The New Testament  Is literal  From the Catholic Church  Rejecting the Old Testament  Which you've now agreed 
[02:34:30]  That that was never the case  To the Catholic Church  Looking at it  Looking at it  In a literary  Metaphorical sense  Which of course  Has always been the case  We are not the fundamentalists  In the Catholic Church  We've always looked at it  In a poetic stance  And to look at the  Whole ideas behind it  And that's why  You have these  Constant interpretations  But where you'll never see  Forget the Old Testament  If you want  You'll never see anything  In the New Testament  Which would ever  Give countenance  To anything  Outside of marriage  Being between a man  And a woman  It's simply not there  You can't even read it 
[02:35:00]  Between the lines  But don't forget Bill  Also back then  When you talk  About 2,000 years ago  When Greeks did plays  They would have men  Play the women  And you know  Talk about the Bible  Because I said to you  What do you think  Christ would do  And again  Not with the abortion issue  Because I think  He'd probably give you  The nod on that one  But when it comes to  Just closing  Closing helpful institutions  To keep gays out  I mean don't forget  The Bible  You would know  Much better than I  How many years  After Christ's death  Did they vote  On the most popular  Church stories  And make them  Into what we know 
[02:35:30]  Is the Bible  Like there were  Plenty of teachings  And readings  And things that  Were written by Christ  And spoken by Christ  That were not  Included in the Bible  Someone had to edit  That stuff  You're right  I mean it's basically  Oral history  Starting about 60 years  After Christ's death  And it continued on  Then you know  For a number of years  Obviously after that  And you get the  Council of Nicaea  In the 4th century  And the like  So it's been an oral history  Some of the accounts  Most of the accounts  Jive pretty well  I can't tell an accurate story  From a year ago  That's what 
[02:36:00]  Yeah Bill  With all due respect  And I have family  That are  I have family  That are clergy  Sincerely  I don't practice anymore  But with all due respect  Do you really think  Logically  That something  That started orally  60 years after  The death of Christ  And wasn't even documented  For God knows  How long after that  Could not have been  Tampered with  Could not have been  No because you had  Eyewitnesses as well  And then everybody  Would have to be lying  I mean you're talking  About a conspiracy  So wild  That even Oliver Stone 
[02:36:30]  Wouldn't believe  No no no  Not lying  No no not lying Bill  No no no  But people like you say  There were these  Like you say  Certain things you look at  As interpretive and poetic  And people retelling  The stories of Jesus  Or again  Especially 60 years after  A lot of them  Were probably second generation  By that point  By 60 years after Christ's death  If he died when he was 33  His friends were probably 33  That would make a lot of them 90s  Back then people really  Didn't live that long  So you're probably dealing  With a second generation  Telling by then  Isn't it possible  That a lot of what they said 
[02:37:00]  Was interpretive and poetic  Without the motive of lying  Or being deceitful  But just of kind of  Getting their point across as well  And everyone likes to  Pump up a story a little bit  Just a little bit  There's no question  That there's ongoing  Interpretations of the New Testament  But there are even people  In the Jesus Seminar  Who are wackos  Even they agree  There are certain fundamentals  Which cannot be disputed  And you have people  Who rejected the idea  Of Christ being the Son of God  Who certainly understood  His humanity  That he existed  And whatnot  So I mean  It gets extremely complicated 
[02:37:30]  But I think  Getting off the subject here  I see nothing  That Jesus has ever taught  That would ever confirm  The idea that marriage  Could be something  Other than what it's supposed to be  Which is namely  Between a man and a woman  But just the idea  Like when you look  At a guy like Christ  I mean he  A guy like Christ  Yes  I'm saying that  Because he came as a man  And when you look at  The way he was  The way he looked differently  Than the people of the time  I mean if you want to believe  You know again  People think he was this  People think he had long hair  He was definitely white  Washing a leper's feet  Like that went against 
[02:38:00]  The grain of the way  Society looked at lepers  People looked at lepers  Like they were these disgusting  These disgusting things  That should be cast out  And he knelt  He cleaned somebody's feet  What did they do with the leper  I don't know these stories  You would know  I think there's a huge difference  Between tending to the dispossessed  The needy  And the forgotten  And the human trash  That we've done in our society  The way we've treated  Blacks and others  I mean there's no question  That that is sinful  But again I think  It's a hell of a leap 
[02:38:30]  To go from  You know  Trying to care for the leper  And saying that  Tom and Dick can get married  It sounds like a big leap  But when you look at the way  Society at that time  Viewed the leper  And you look at the way  Society views homosexual  It comes from the way  Society is looking at things  And we look at lepers now  It's like wow  They're human beings  They should be treated with respect  They should be treated medically  Back then they didn't  And Christ was bucking the system  And he would say  I'm going to treat this person  Beautifully and differently  Than you all will  And you are all wrong  For not treating them well  Treat an individual 
[02:39:00]  Is one thing  For example  We don't throw homosexuals  Out of windows  As they do in Muslim countries  And things of that nature  But what we do say  Is that while everyone  Is entitled to equal respect  We don't think  We should make marriage  Between a man and woman  An alternative lifestyle  That's why we don't  Give the same benefits  To a guy and a gal  Who cohabit  In other words  What used to be called  Shacking up  They don't get the same benefits  According to what you're saying  We're leaving them out too  They're another victim  In our society  More people have been excluded 
[02:39:30]  You know what the hell  With them  If they don't want to get married  They should get nothing  But Bill  Isn't like  You just said  I just actually  Just lost my point  As you were speaking  I looked up at the television  And my mind just shut down  I had something to say  My hand is actually  In the air  I'm going to tell you  And my brain just said  Nothing is coming out  Let's go to Keith  You go ahead  Well I'm going to just  Say this right now  My brother who's a bishop  Would really give Joe  A good beating  On all his horse shit  That he's been saying  Joe made a couple  Good points on man  He did  He did halfway good  I got to say  He did halfway good  But you know 
[02:40:00]  My brother has a  You know  He's very extensive  In his knowledge  About the church  Yeah my dad's a deacon  What's your point  A deacon  Shut up  No I won't shut up  You know what a deacon is  Yeah it's a step below  A priest stupid  It's a street sweeper  It's a step below  A priest stupid  And my dad  Doesn't completely  Agree with my stance  Obviously he's a deacon  In the catholic church  He has his own beliefs  I'm an atheist  You're an atheist  So we have  Completely separate beliefs  But the point is  Dude  This is what kills me  And I'm not trying  To take a dig at you Keith 
[02:40:30]  But it's the God's honest truth  I want you to take a dig at me  It's like  You are  You're preaching  All this church  No I'm not preaching  Church  You're not Christ-like  In any way  Listen to me  Joe I understand  You're wanting  Two women to be married  You're shaped like a woman  You got tits  He looks like a lesbian  That really  That really made Bill happy  I heard the laugh  Bill enjoyed that one a lot  But I'm saying  No no no  I see what you're saying  But you know  I just think that  You know  Everybody  You got mixed up 
[02:41:00]  From what we were  Originally saying  It's about the kids  And it's about the kids  A mother and a father  We want a thousand  We went way over that  And nobody stayed on that  Does that mean nobody  I'm sorry to interrupt you Joseph  I gotta say this one thing  And I called you Joseph  You talk about  It's about the kids  And Bill acknowledges  The barbaric way  The church  For a long time  Handled the scandals  With the kids  And they do handle it  A lot better now  But come on  I mean  It was only society's push bill  That caused the church  To handle the pedophilia scandals  The way they did  For many many years 
[02:41:30]  It was the unspoken  Ugly secret  That the good  Even the good priests  And the good  Or the well meaning  Cardinals and stuff  Buried it for the  Better good of the church  Let me just say  And I'm certainly not  Going to exculpate  The Catholic church  In this  But I'll say this  For many many years  Every institution  From the public schools  To the Boy Scouts  To the  Whatever group  You want to talk about  That dealt with kids  Every group was told  By the psychologists  That we can fix these men  And we'll give them 
[02:42:00]  Some therapy  And rehabilitation  And then we'll put them  Back into the field  So to speak  And of course  If these psychologists  To me  And I have a doctorate  In sociology  And I had psychologists  Working for me  For a number of years  When I was a professor  These people  Are absolutely wrong  In the way  They've given this advice  They haven't paid  A price for this  The cardinals  Like the school  Superintendents  Figured okay  Well Joe wasn't a bad guy  What he did was wrong  But now he's been fixed  According to Dr. Psycho  And of course  Now he's put back in 
[02:42:30]  And the same thing  Happened again  I don't think  I don't think  I don't think  You can blame  Come on  I don't think  That's fair  I don't think  You can blame  The way for many  Many many years  The church handled  Those scandals  Which was to keep  A hush on it  I don't think  You can somehow  Throw the blame  On bad advice  From school superintendents  And psychologists  I think that's a way  Of diverting it  From you  Example here  I mean first of all  We're talking  In a sweeping way  Just take New York City here  We didn't have  A major problem here  It was certain places 
[02:43:00]  Like Boston and L.A.  And other places  It's not as if  Every single diocese  Okay  One of the reasons  Why they didn't have  A big problem in New York  Is because they're  A good priest  Like Father Benedict Rochelle  Who's a Columbia University  Ph.D. in psychology  Who dealt with these situations  But so we have to be careful  About making sweeping generalizations  But look  We've got a terrible problem  About this  In the Catholic  In the public schools  Dr. Carol Shakespeare  Is the nation's  Leading authority on this  And she estimates  That the problem  In the public schools  Is 100 times  Greater than what it is 
[02:43:30]  In the Catholic Church  And so  We had 10 accusations  Last year  Over 40,000 priests  Now you know  It doesn't make  Because it's not a big thing  But quite frankly  Most of the damage  Was done in the 60s  70s  And the first half  Of the 80s  Well Bill  Here's what I think  When I'm looking at Joe  And Joe  Is a little angry  About his Catholic school  Experience I believe  And I think Joe  Had a certain  Do you want to tell us  Something Joe  Did you have an experience  Did you have an experience  No  I wish I did  To tell you 
[02:44:00]  It would bring the funny  Back to this  Raging debate  That we're having  We should do a speed round  And get Bill off the phone  Bill  Did you see  Religious  Bill Morrisville  No I didn't  I told him  And he keeps going  On Larry King  Saying Bill Downey  Who said he wants  To beat me up  I did say in jest  That I'd like to meet him  In Madison Square Garden  Put on the Everlast  And even though  I'm older than him  I know I could kick his butt  Why wouldn't you see that movie 
[02:44:30]  And then you know  Comment about it  Right  Because it was a pretty  It was a pretty big movie  It wasn't one of these  Little features  Little indie films  That no one saw  I know  I used to go to pubs  On weekends to relax  Well he did get into  The Vatican too Bill  I mean it's not  I mean Bill Maher  We know he's very very liberal  But he did actually get  You know he did actually  Interview guys  Who worked very closely  With the Pope  Priests  I mean you know  People who really are  In the know  He didn't just talk  To a bunch of fringe players  Right  Yeah I look  The movie  We've covered enough  Of this  What this guy's had to say  In the past  At least in the movie 
[02:45:00]  From everything we've learned  We did have people  Here at the office  Go to see it  And give me  Give a report on it  But shouldn't you say it  He didn't single out  He didn't single out  The Catholic Church  The way he typically does  With his vicious comments  And when he's been relentless  Look the guy's a punk  Alright  As far as I have no use  For Bill Maher  And I have got a whole lot  Of use for this other punk  Ron Howard  And his friend Dan Brown  Coming out with this movie  May 15th  Angels and Demons  What a bunch of crap  This is  What is it  I've not heard of it  It's the sequel  To Da Vinci  Yeah  What about this punk 
[02:45:30]  Joe DeRosa  What do you think about him  Hold on  I want to hear about  The new Ron Howard film  Yes  Still was on a rant there  Go ahead  Yeah  They're saying  They're saying  There's this group  The Illuminati  Which existed  In the 1600s  And they persecuted  They were angry  That Galileo  Was persecuted  By the Catholic Church  And so  They're seeking revenge  They're alive today  And they're going to  Blow up the Vatican  Of course  Robert Langdon  The Harvard professor  Played by Tom Hanks  He's going to come 
[02:46:00]  To the rescue  Of the Vatican  And what not  Let me tell you  Something first  First of all  Galileo was never  Persecuted by the  Catholic Church  I can talk about that  If you want  The Illuminati  Didn't exist  In the 1600s  Folks  It was founded  In Bavaria  On May the 1st  Of 1776  And it folded  In 1787  So why is Dan Brown  Conjuring up  This crazy  Bill  Bill  To go after  The Catholic Church  On science  Bill  It's a work  There's a word  Called fiction  It's a work  Of fiction  It's a fictitious  Book  You know what else  Bill  You know what else 
[02:46:30]  Didn't happen  The Tarantino movie  Coming out  The Inglorious Bastards  That didn't happen  Where Brad Pitt  Didn't rally together  Six soldiers  To go kill Nazis  Mercilessly  During war  It's a story  That takes place  In a historical context  But it's a work  Of fiction  Nobody  Dan Brown  Has never claimed  Any of that work  To be true  In fact he's come out  That's not true  He's come out openly  And said  To these accusations  That it's a work  Of fiction  I don't understand  What everybody's upset about  Bill  What did he say  What did he say  On his website Bill  The first page 
[02:47:00]  Of the Da Vinci Code  Before you even  Get into the story  He lists three facts  All of which  Are demonstrably false  And in Angels and Demons  If you go on to  Dan Brown's own website  It'll say  It's an historical fact  That the Illuminati  Were formed in 1600  I mean the guy  Plays both sides  Of the street  Is another guy  Like Oliver Stone  And it's half fact  It's half fiction  And let me tell you  Something  CBS doesn't show  The reruns  Of Amos and Andy  That was fiction  But African Americans  Take great umbrage 
[02:47:30]  At being stereotyped  Like that  And that's why  They don't show it  Because they don't  Want to offend  African Americans  And they're not  Going to make a movie  Out of the protocols  Of the elders of Zion  Which is an anti-Semitic  Screed  In the late 19th century  Because it'll affect Jews  When it comes to Catholics  Oh we can make it up  We can invent dirty laundry  We can do what we want  It's the same old crap  I've seen it time and time again  It's only one group  You can dump on with impunity  And that's Catholics  And I'm fed up with it  Alright Bill  Well we're going to wrap it up  But you're always  A compelling guest  We're working on you 
[02:48:00]  It's going to take a while  We're trying to bring you around  It's going to  A work in progress  We should do a drinking show  With Bill Donahue  I want to bring Bill  In studio  In studio  Bill would you ever  Come in studio  And talk about  Everything but religion  With us  I would love to see  Your take on other shit  Well I mean yeah  I mean listen  I'm a regular guy  I'm a Yankee fan  Although I'm very dispirited  This year because  These guys have become  Such rip-off artists  And whatnot  But no  I have a new book  Coming out by the way  You guys hope  I mentioned very briefly 
[02:48:30]  It's a book called  Secular Sabotage  I've never mentioned this  By the way before  On radio or TV  How liberals are destroying  Religion and culture  In America  Wow  That's strong  That looks like a good read  Alright well  You gotta come in one time  I was told  Cause I'm one of those guys  Anthony's not here by the way  You've been talking to Opie  Keith Robinson  I'm Jim Norton  And Joe DeRosa  A little Opie  Mostly Joe and Jimmy  For the last hour and a half  Jesus  But I  Shut up Joe  I happen to take photos 
[02:49:00]  With people  I like doing it  And they said that  The Archbishop  I wouldn't be able  To take a photo with him today  Cause they didn't want  To overwhelm him  On his first day  I don't think that was  Coming from him obviously  He was busy  So I accept that  But I'd like you to  Throw the word out  Well I got a picture  Of the Archbishop  That I'm going to be  Tweeting in about  Two minutes here  Bill Donnie  And I'm actually  In the photo too  Cause you can see  My reflection in the glass  As he's well protected  So I technically  Got a photo with the guy  Jimmy  He's a good man  He's got a great  Humor  And I think he's  A great fit for New York 
[02:49:30]  I really do  Alright well  We would love to have him in  And thanks Bill  For coming on  It's always a fun debate  Thank you guys  Take care  Alright  Guy knows his facts  Yeah I mean  Joe was going at him  A little bit  I gotta give  Oh Joe  Good job Joe  The funny part is  I'm going to tell my dad  I met that guy  And he'll probably be like  Oh really  What was that like  We screamed at each other  For 20 minutes  Joe wasn't that bad  He was worked up  He got so worked up  He took his glasses off  I love that  Joe was good 
[02:50:00]  And then he was rubbing  His ball bag for a while  You saw that too  Right Danny  Joe's having a problem  With his ball bag today  What's wrong  I don't know  It's riding up  In these button fly jeans  Cause he don't have  Dick separation  That means he has  A small penis  Your dick usually  Takes it  And knocks everything loose  Can't argue it  I got a tiny dick  You need the big dick  To give yourself a scene  Yeah you gotta  I got some  After the church  Now we can talk  We got  We got someone on the line  We haven't heard from  In a long time 
[02:50:30]  Before we go to break  I don't want to lose him  Bill Donahue  Andrew  Anyone  Good morning  Andrew from Brooklyn  Right  You're big on NASA  Right  Let's talk about NASA  This time  No I'm talking about NASA  What's it about  We were talking recently  About the issue  The gay marriage issue  You know like  Bill Donahue  Is absolutely right  About this issue  About gay marriage  Cause you know  You know  The state of California  You know  Most people in that state 
[02:51:00]  Do not like gay marriage  Several years back  I think it was 2000  They voted against  Gay marriage  They did not  They  They  They  They  Those  Proposition on the ballot  Where they voted  Completely against gay marriage  They shall endeavor  Okay  Sorry  No no no  That's okay  Because you're right  They did vote against gay marriage  And it's funny you call Andrew  Because we were discussing  During the break  It's very ironic  That you called  During this gay marriage issue  Because we were talking  About how a few years ago 
[02:51:30]  The  We saw that the  The  The  Oh was it  The Challenger  Come back in  And blow up  What was it that just blew up  A couple years ago  The Challenger right  No  It was a different shuttle  It's not about a shuttle  Forget about it  No no no  I know  But I want to know  Because we were just talking about it  It was Columbia  It was Columbia  What's the one that's active now  Discovery  Atlantis  And Endeavor  That's it  Okay  And now back to the issue 
[02:52:00]  And then last year  You had  Those  A bunch of people  Went over to the  California Supreme Court  And then said  Well we want gay marriage  And then  These four  Justices  On the California Supreme Court  Forced  That  Down  The state  Of California's  Throats  There was no  Voting  There was no  Nobody  In California  The state of California  Had to say  It was just  Four  Stupid ass  Justices 
[02:52:30]  So you basically  The four justices  Yeah they did actually do that  I mean I can't even argue that  But do you think  Let me ask you  Does this have anything to do  Like how are you feeling  I want to talk about NASA  For a few  Did you call to talk about NASA  No it's not about NASA  It's about gay marriage  I came here  To talk about this issue  And then  In October  Well in November  They voted  They put proposition  On the  They put proposition  On the ballot  And this proposition 
[02:53:00]  Would put an end  To gay marriage  The vast majority  Of the state  Voted  For proposition  Eight  And these are not  Just conservatives  These are people  That vote  For Obama  Liberals too  These are people  That vote for Obama  Huh  And then  And then they were like  Oh  And then they said  All these gay groups  They're like  Oh they violated  Our civil rights  They took away  Our rights  To be married  I mean  This is ridiculous 
[02:53:30]  But Andrew  Do you think  Hold on  Andrew  You're on a roll here  I'm not even disagreeing with you  You're making some valid points  As usual  Yeah absolutely  But the point we were trying  To make was  That like  Now they're talking about  Sending  A manned mission  To Mars  Which  I mean  Do you foresee that  As being a smart move  For NASA  Or is that something  That's going to fail miserably  Well  Wherever  Wherever they want  To go through  Is  It's their choice  Is that what you 
[02:54:00]  Is that what you basically  Did you call to discuss that  No  I'm not here to call  For that  I'm here to talk about  This issue  That you all  Are talking about  Okay  We were discussing that  With Bill Donahue  Sometimes  Whenever you call  Because we were discussing  Space  Do you want to  Do you want to talk  A little bit about  The Challenger  Because we were going over  I had watched a frame by frame  Thing with NASA  Where they actually go over  Every single  Let me interrupt  Andrew he's a little confused  Why are you calling the show  Yeah not that we don't watch you  Do we like you  Yeah Jimmy just came into the studio  And moral issues 
[02:54:30]  That is what is  That is what I called for  For what  No back to what I was saying  Jimmy  What were you talking about  NASA  The issue of gay marriage  That's the one I'm sticking with  Oh okay  Okay  Alright so gay marriage  And alright  We can talk about that  For a few minutes  We were on that  But we saw your name  On the screen  We thought you had called in  To talk a little bit  About the Challenger  Yeah you're an expert  On the space shuttle  So that's where  Jimmy's a little confused  But Andrew's not calling 
[02:55:00]  For that today  He's calling for something else  Okay Andrew  Yes now back to what I was saying  You don't want to talk about  The Challenger at all  Huh  You're not here to talk about  The Challenger or the Endeavor  No I'm definitely not here  To talk about anything  Space or anything else  I'm just talking about  The issue of gay marriage  And moral issues  I'm against the Endeavor  That's what I was saying  About Proposition 8  Like  So the state of California  Voted for Proposition 8  And then  And they supported  Overwhelmingly 
[02:55:30]  And then  All these gay actors  Were like  Oh they stole our rights  Wait who said  They stole our rights  The gay activists  Okay  And then  There were  So many protests  They went after  The Mormon church  Now  Honestly I'm not a Mormon  I'm not a Mormon  Definitely  What religion are you  What religion are you  Andrew  We don't know much about you  Christian  Oh okay  Christian  Do you need a tissue  No I'm fine  And then  They just ripped them  They were smearing Mormons  And then  There were  There were 
[02:56:00]  Several gay activists  Who were on the internet  Spreading Mormon churches  Wanted to do this and that  And then there were  Some of these protests  Where they went after  Black voters  Well Andrew  You're not wrong though  Hold on  You're not wrong  Because gay activists  The really  When you looked at  The gay activists  Really did  Kind of target  The Mormon church  Are you  How do you  Do you feel  The gay activists  Were very  Very aggressive  Yes they were aggressive  They were  They were like  They were just  Ripping  They were friending them 
[02:56:30]  On the internet  And then they  They kept attacking  Black voters  For supporting  Saying how  Oh  Oh like you  Like you  You have  Like how gay marriage  Is a civil rights issue  Are you black  Since when  Gay marriage  Is a civil rights issue  So yeah  No no  Keith is asking  If you're a black man  Andrew  Yes I'm a black  Man  Of course  I'm a black man  We don't know  Anything about you  Andrew  You say that  Of course  We don't know  I hate to say it

[03:08:30]  At the  Stress Factory  Tonight  Vinny's Club  In New Brunswick  New Jersey  I don't know what  Mike you're on  There Keith  Am I on the  Right Mike  Keep talking  Yes  Testing one two  Alright got it  Here I am  My DJ voice  I like that DJ voice  We were just talking  About Keith Robinson  And I was saying it  To his face  Even though he's  In the room  You never know  Where he's coming  From  Yeah you do  Find the shittiest  Place  That's where  Keith is coming  From  Sometimes you feel  Like he's with you  But any second  He can just  Punch you in the face  He's very confusing 
[03:09:00]  To figure out  Keith will stab you  In the back  Faster  Keith is  Joe Pantoliano  In the Matrix  Like he's the guy  That's like on the team  And then you catch him  Eating dinner  With Agent Smith  Yeah  I like having fun man  And you guys are fun  See I don't know  Where he's going  I have no idea  How sensitive  Is Bob Kelly  We were talking about  This before too  About how Bob  How fucking real  Does he get  When you make fun  Of his weight now  Like he  Bob is brutal  Bob is brutal 
[03:09:30]  And yet as soon as  You go to the weight  He gets real  And he gets sensitive  But the thing with Bob  Is that even though  He's lost weight  You really can't tell  He looks like a guy  That's about to be fat again  Yeah  So he's never really  In shape  Like you go  Man this guy's in shape  Cause he's like  You know  Young Dom DeLuise  That's what he looks like  And Cannonball Run  If you were to look  Dude  Burr and I were watching  This is when Bobby  Was still heavy  Burr and I were watching  Cannonball Run one day  And we rewound  That scene  Where they get pulled over 
[03:10:00]  In the ambulance  Four fucking times  Because it looks so much  Like Bobby  Really  And Billy was like  We were both saying  Like I was gonna ask  Bobby if he would go out  But I was too afraid  He'd get angry  But I wanted to go out  Like that as Halloween  On Halloween with Bobby  Where I'd be Burt Reynolds  And he'd be dumb  But it's like  You can't propose that  To a man  Without him getting hot  I mean that's not  A compliment in any way  Shape or form  So he's hanging on  For dear life though  He could be a fat guy  By you know  June  Oh he gets so sad  He's hanging on  He's gone 
[03:10:30]  He's gone to be fat  You think so  Yes  But you say that to him  I put money on it  And instead of teasing you back  He's like  Dude I'm not fat anymore  You can't say that  Jesus Bob  I'm kidding  I'm not really  A shellless turtle  But I'll take it  When I walk in the room  I mean I'm really  A mammal  Yeah Bob  He gets real sensitive  About his weight  And his smartness  His intelligence  He gets really  Infuriated  You should get Bobby  On the phone  So he can maybe  Defend himself  Just once in his life  Just once in his life  Bob wants to hear  Damn Bob  I didn't think of that 
[03:11:00]  Yeah  Just once  Bob wants someone  To say that  Unbelievable Bob  Yeah just once  He wants that  Let's move on  We got a good Yankee  Yankee story here  Someone getting kicked  Out of the stadium  You hear this one yet  No I have not  This is a good story  Let's go  One to ten  How much of an emergency  Was it  You know  I wouldn't say  It was a ten  But it was certainly  You know  At least a seven  Between the seven  And a break in the  Baseball game  Web guy Brad  Campbell Lurion  Thought it would be  A good time  To take care of business  Only he says  He got the foul  Business end 
[03:11:30]  Of two NYPD officers  Who ejected him  From Yankee Stadium  I have my arms  Twisted behind my back  His indiscretion  He says  Was to try to take  His pee break  During the playing  Of God Bless America  As they threw me  Out of the gate  They told me  To get out of their  Country if I didn't  Like it  Out of their country  Are you  What's your heritage  Are you a U.S. citizen  I'm an American citizen  Born and bred  So it's my country as well  So basically  The guy  He got kicked out  Of Yankee Stadium  For getting up  To pee during  America the Beautiful 
[03:12:00]  You know what  You can't throw  A guy out for that  Of course not  Fucking stupid  Of course not  Let him go piss  I thought he was  Doing it right there  In the seat  Into a cup  No  He's taking it  So seriously  Wouldn't you be laughing  No  He got thrown out  Of a $400 seat  You wouldn't laugh  Your ass off  If that happened  If somebody threw you out  I took a dumb  Pee break  No  You'd be  Hungry out  At the fucking  Pee stadium  Keith would be  Swinging the whole way  Out to the parking lot  Yeah I would have to  I love fighting  A good cop  No I'm joking  The story just keeps 
[03:12:30]  Going on and on  It's just a simple  Dumb story  But  Now whatever it was  That got him  Thinking about a  Bathroom run  We can only speculate  But we can tell you  The playing of  God bless America  What does that mean  By the way  This is Arthur  Chien  The one we got fired  Oh yeah  Yeah oops  Sorry Arthur  Good to see you  Working again though  But we can tell you  The playing of  God bless America  At baseball games  Began after 9-11  And in some stadiums  Continues today  The Yankees  Actually have a policy  Restricting movement  Of fans 
[03:13:00]  During that sign  It was fine  The year after 9-11  But it's gotten tired  Yeah they should go  To the bathroom  100%  Because when you  Gotta go  You gotta go  Others though  Are a little bit tougher  On Brad's bladder  I would want it in  Oh yeah  How old are you  I'm 11  Yeah you can hold it in  For a long time  At 11  Yes I can  Yeah cause you're 11  Exactly  Get up to our age  You can't hold it in  See they would have  Throw him out  If he would have  Just peed right in  On the spot  If he would have  Stayed there  You know  Just peed right there  He should just 
[03:13:30]  Piss his pants  Irrespectful  I've taken 10 pees  In the last  Two and a half hours  Yeah  He didn't want to  Hear the song  He just said  Fuck it  I don't want to  Hear this shit  I'm going to the bathroom  Yeah so then  I can see the  Star of the game  That's the 7th inning  What  God bless America's  In the 7th inning  Yeah  It is  I thought that's how  They opened the game  Joe knows nothing  About sports  Yeah  Ever since 9-11  It's a new thing  Oh yeah  I'm sorry  You're not a sports  Joe's not a sports  We got the NYPD  We got the NYPD guy  With this  The NYPD says  Brad was ejected  Because he was cursing 
[03:14:00]  Disorderly  And reeked of alcohol  Though he was neither  Arrested nor issued  Any summonses  He and his lawyers  At the New York  Civil Liberties Union  Have filed a lawsuit  Designed to stop  Officers from enforcing  A policy on patriotism  The police obviously  Should be doing  The business of  Enforcing the law  They should not be  In the business  Of enforcing Yankee policy  Much less a Yankee policy  That requires people  To participate  In a patriotic ritual  And now we allow Brad  To have the last shake  And when you force someone  To be patriotic 
[03:14:30]  You know  You devalue  The very freedom  That patriotism  Stands for  In the first place  Well he got the last shake  Yeah  His stupid Nicolas Cage voice  Is annoying me too  He got the last shake  You diminished the approach  For it to shut up  You know he's right  Even though he's right  I hate him  I should have shot him  You got a couple of the Yankees  Shooting steroids in the ass  And throwing this poor bum out  Yeah  He'll get a  He'll get another game  Out of it  They'll throw him a game  Just for PR reasons  Just to shut him up 
[03:15:00]  Yeah they'll probably  Let him sit down  In the little batter's box  Yeah he'll be able  To fucking run around  Yelling fucking  A lock bar  During the national anthem  We got Bobo on the line  Bobo  I got a little song  About the Endeavor guy  Wait  Andrew from Brooklyn  Who likes to say  Endeavor  Space shuttle  And we also found out  He says issue  And California  Was a good one too  California  Alright go ahead Bobo  Andrew  He seems to be a big expert

[03:17:30]  But what surgeons found  Left them simply shocked  It's still not clear  How this happened  The patient said  It's possible  He inhaled a tree bud  At some point  But this biologist  Said it's absolutely  Impossible  That a green plant  Could grow inside  A human body  From a seed  She noted  That certain conditions  Light, water  And a certain temperature  Are needed for a plant  To grow from a seed  The patient  A heavy smoker  Had complained  Of chest pains  He was back at work  Less than a week  After having  The small tree removed 
[03:18:00]  The doctor said  They intend to file  A report  On the unusual case  Don't we have enough  To worry about  Now we got to worry  About like trees  Growing in our lungs  Jesus Christ  I don't like these stories  I'm so dumb  I'm sitting there going  Well maybe he just  Swallowed like a piece  Of a tree  And then I'm like  You can't swallow  Something into your lung  Moron  How big  Can we see the picture  I would love to see that  That is bizarre  It was a redwood  Yeah did they say  How big the  Was it like a little  Fucking  We see a photo  You know  What did he  Did he smoke  A lot of weed 
[03:18:30]  Maybe he smoked  A lot of weed  And maybe it was  A pot plant  Yeah a little pot plant  Right  That's what I believe  A little seed  I'm going with it  Yeah  I'm going with a little pot  Growing in his lungs  Let's smoke that shit  Re-smoke that shit  Re-smoke that shit  Yeah  A lot of reefer  Is that the picture  I say reefer  Do they even say reefer anymore  No they don't  Old man  Reefer sticks  Want to sell some  Mary Janes  Fucking  You kids smoking  Some wacky tobacco  Over here  I think reefer

[03:20:30]  It's close enough  On a ruler I do believe  Oh  What  .39  What Travis  .39  It's like pie  Kind of  Yeah it just keeps  Going and going  And he had to get  Surgery to remove this  Yeah  One thing I'm  You want to  Want to go somewhere  Jimmy what do you got  Woody Allen  Has got to be in hell  Because he's such a  Private guy  And he's suing  American Apparel  Because they put him  In the rabbi  Which is one of his movies  And we're not asking  They just put him in an ad 
[03:21:00]  And he says he doesn't  Endorse  Products in this country  In this country  But he'll do it  Elsewhere  What's that about  I don't know  He's just  He's an artist  And he's weird  And he's Woody  You know  The Tonight Show  Wants him so bad  They've offered him  The entire show  They'll give it to him  Like a whole  The whole hour  With just Jay and him  And he's like  He's a fucking weird guy  Why wouldn't he do that  He's Woody  He doesn't have to  He doesn't have to  And he doesn't want to  It's Woody Allen  I mean it's like  He's just a  And that's when  You know you made it  Yeah  Don't have to  Letterman did that too  Letterman offered  A whole episode  To who

[03:22:00]  The dude never stopped  Doing it  Was he really  It was hilarious  I don't remember that  It's on YouTube  It was hilarious  He came out  And he did a five minute speech  And it was essentially stand up  And it was  It was hilarious  Do we have that  I would love to hear that  Because I have  Yeah  It's online  I forget who he was talking about  Fuck online  We'll just throw it on our show  Four less minutes for us  Exactly  You're a smart man Joe  Gonna keep you around  You see  You see it  Alright so what do we got  On Woody Allen  He's suing him for 10 million dollars  And he's 73 years old  And they're fucking aggressively 
[03:22:30]  Going after his personal life  They're saying  We didn't destroy his reputation  He did that  And they want to go into  His whole  Soon-Yi Previn  Hook up  And you know  They're just being scumbags about it  I mean  I'm completely on Woody's side  You can't throw a guy  In a fucking ad  Without asking him  You can't do it  And they're  Yeah they're saying  He ruined his own reputation  A long time ago  So  They're being total  Fucking scumbags  Their scumbag store too  I bought a sweatshirt there  And you know  Like two hours after I bought it  I was like  Why did I buy this  I don't want this 
[03:23:00]  It was 50 bucks  It's a piece of shit  I don't want it  And I went to bring it back  And they're like  No you can't  Store credit only  And I was like  What  And they're one of those stores  That puts the tiny sign  Down where you're not  Fucking looking  That says  You know  All purchases are fine  I'm like  You guys are fucking dirt balls  How is store credit legal?  I don't even know if it is legal  It can't be legal  You should say  Fuck that  You know what  Maybe  I don't want your stupid store credit  If the product is defective  You might be able to get a full  Maybe they can do that  I'm guessing  If the product is defective  You can get your money back legally 
[03:23:30]  But maybe if you just don't want it  Well  The phone's lit up  And I got really excited  Like we were going to go into  Some fun directions here  But  No  Everyone wants to let Danny and Travis  And everybody else know  That 2.54 centimeters make an inch  That was so important  That everybody called at the same time  Nobody calls during the Bill Donahue debate  Yeah  No they actually  Actually  I mean  If he would shut up for a minute  We would have went to the phones  Oh really?  Bill knows how to fill up the space  With words 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  Dude  You don't know when to get in there  I'm proud that I don't know  How many centimeters are in an inch  Exactly  That's fine  He was screaming like Jimmy Hoffa  During those Senate hearings  Right  He is  I want it stricken from the record  I am not a communist  I was like  Jesus Christ  Yeah  The  Wait  Jimmy's got a phone call  Oh  Those motherfuckers  Factory wall  How do we stop these people?  They call me all the time  How do we stop these people? 
[03:24:30]  It's not too late  Please don't make the mistake of driving without a warrant  How the fuck do we stop these people?  They really are bugging me  This is the final call  These fucking scumbags  Dude  Here's how you do it though  We're all getting these phone calls  Every single one of us now  Yes  And they found the email too  They do it on the email  Oh this is good  Are you going to go with it?  I'm going to  I know how to get out of 
[03:25:00]  No they're going to laugh at you  I've tried  I guarantee there's going to be a laugh and a hang up  That's what I'm guessing  This is the second notice on your warranty on your car  That one?  Yeah  Yeah  They call me all the time  I want to know what the scam is  Because I don't have warranties on my car  Cars  You can protect yourself from the high cost of auto repair  These pieces of shit  I don't have a car  I guarantee they got the  I guarantee they got the information 
[03:25:30]  They probably bought it  From the car dealerships  I'm going to call up GM  I want to know if they sold my information  I don't know what's going on  We're all getting these calls  There's not  Yeah  There's not one person out there  I think at this point  Not getting this exact call  I press one  And I'm on hold  I just need to ask you a simple question  Okay  Oh yes  This is James Norton's father  Are you calling for James Norton? 
[03:26:00]  Well this number that you're calling  That was James Norton  But he passed away  This number you have to  What's that?  Yes that is the phone number 
[03:26:30]  And James died  And we've been trying to tell people  And we're being harassed by telemarketers  But he passed away  Thank you very much  What do they say?  That's how you get rid of them  No fucking way  You're not getting rid of them  No way  Yeah  Keep us updated on that  There's no way that's going to work in the end  I guarantee this is why  When you say  What'd she say?  We'll get rid of that number  We apologize for the call  We'll put down the do not call list  Did you just come up with the solution to this?  No I didn't do it  It was told to me  Oh my god 
[03:27:00]  When you say take me off the list  Right  If you say put me  There's a way to do it  Well hold on hold on  Because that's what we tried at my house  Take us off the list  They put you on another list  The lady laughed openly  And then hung up  They put you on another list  And they do it simply by phone number  So they have it by phone number  So you have to say  Someone told me  Just say that you died  Or the person is dead  And they won't call  Because they don't take that as a rejection  They take that as  Oh we can't make this sale  So then you really do come off 
[03:27:30]  That's what I've been told  But there's different companies doing this  I get them at my home number  I got woken up yesterday  By the one at my home number  These motherfuckers  Who is selling them this information  Because they didn't know my name  They just had the phone number  Yeah they're just getting phone numbers  So then it's got to be the cell phone company  Has to be  No but they're saying vehicle warranty  Yeah I apologize  Yeah but no no no  The vehicle warranty is just all  I mean a ton of people are on instant feedback  Saying I get the same call  I don't even own a car  So that's just the excuse to get you on the line 
[03:28:00]  Okay  There must be other directions  They go with those phone calls  Hold on I got Chris in Atlanta  Chris go ahead  These people are based out of Smyrna Georgia  They are our local news  They're the whole story on  And I know how to stop them from calling  How?  When they call my phone  I told them I gave them their street address  And I told them the first fucker  That comes out of that building  Is going to total fucking ass whooping  If they call my phone again  I hadn't heard of them in two months  Probably two months  Three months  I ain't heard nothing out of them  Oh wow really  So you basically just threatened them  I told them I said hey 
[03:28:30]  I know exactly  Kate's nodding  He likes that word  What's the name of the company  That's making these factory warranty calls  There's different ones though  It's America something  I know  I can look online  And get it to Danny  On his boundary  Yeah get it  Danny  No Danny  How can he get it to you?  Jeff in Staten Island  Is writing  Get on the do not call list  I don't think that helps  I'm reading an article right here  On MSNB  On our local news  They said that they  Put you on the do not call list  And then they still call you  Yeah  That's what's happening  I just told them  The first person to walk out 
[03:29:00]  Of a fucking building  Is toting an ass whooping  And I hadn't heard of them  In two, three months  Danny how can he send you  The information  So you can get the address?  If he just emails me  At Danny at opianthony.com  I will have all the info there  Alright cool  Alright I'll see  Thank you brother  Thanks man  Let's go to Ziggy in Jersey  Ziggy  Yeah how you doing guys  Listen  I tried that  Do not call dot gov  And that really works  I cut down about  Two  99% of the  Of the calls  Come into my house  And my cell phones  It does really work  So it's do not call dot com 
[03:29:30]  Do not call dot gov  G-O-V  Oh G-O-V  I'm sorry  Do not call dot gov  G-O-V  And you could register  Your business phones  You could register  Your personal phones  Cell phones  Whatever phones you want  You want them  To not call you  That's all you have to do  Yeah I don't think  It's a big secret  I think  But these  These car scam companies  Are not minding  The do not call list  And they're calling people  Anyway even if they are  On the do not call list  Then you could get  The number that calls you  And you could make a complaint  To the government on that 
[03:30:00]  And they'll take care of it  Well it's funny you should say that  Because that leads into  The next thing that's going on  Where you get these  Missed calls  From these bizarre numbers  With extremely strange  At times area codes  877  Where you look up  The area code  On Google or whatever  And it comes up  As a nothing  But then you  You call it back  Because I think  We're all curious  Like who the fuck  Is calling me  What's that about  Are they making money  Off us calling them back  Dude  Just out of curiosity  That is correct  Those calls  Those  Most of those calls  Are from 
[03:30:30]  Dominican Republic  And all those  Weird countries  Dude  Every  Every  Well I shouldn't  I got  I kind of  Blowing my spot a little bit  Well I got  I got people  Watching my stuff for me  And I passed a number  On to somebody  To check into  And like  There's too many numbers  And then I checked  My phone again  And it was absolutely  The numbers  That I gave this person  What is that  What is that about  And it wasn't  And it wasn't  Because it was  An international call  It came up 
[03:31:00]  As an area code  In the United States  But there were a couple  There were like  Two extra numbers in it  When it came up  On my cell phone  Maybe they're using  Some fucking  Caller ID  Alters it  I don't know  I don't know  But that's a new one  That just  Hit last week  With me  Another thing  You guys could do  Just don't give out  Let's say you go  To the store  And they ask you  For the phone number  Or they ask you  For the email address  Just don't give out  That in the store  I never do  Hell fucking no  I say no no no 
[03:31:30]  I never give that  One guy was like  Well you have to give  We need it  I'm like  You're not getting it  Why do you need it  I was so fucking  Aggravated  Never  Never  Right  Give those douchebags  That the cash registers  Your information  Never  They all  I go look  I live in New York City  I got a tiny mailbox  No  I can't give you my address  Because I know  What you're gonna do  You don't need that information  Yeah I don't need  Your dumb fucking pamphlets  And whatever  What's your phone number  No I don't have a phone  Oh they get mad too

[03:33:00]  I just don't know it  Because my bills go somewhere else  Not to get too much into this  And I don't know the zip code  Because sorry  I'm like no  It's my fucking card  Look at the signature on the back  It looks like a lot of  And it happened  Two out of the three gas stations  So it looks like  That's the new thing  With gas stations  I actually like it  Because this way  They  If someone steals your card  Or steals your wallet  They have to know your card  I mean then again  The address is probably  On your license  But  I was almost fucked  I was on empty too  Third gas station  They didn't have that  You know  As their thing yet
