<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course.  The show started with a discussion of Banksy’s guerilla art project in New York City, focusing on his low-cost Central Park art stand and the subsequent vandalism and theft of his work.  This transitioned into a critical discussion of Criss Angel’s magic,  a feud with Tony Orlando’s daughter, Jenny Rose (who was called a "dumb bitch" by one of the hosts on Twitter), and Bob Costas’ commentary on the Washington Redskins name controversy, with the hosts vehemently disagreeing with Costas’ stance.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the increasingly large and expensive children’s birthday parties and nostalgic reflections on Valentine’s Day heartbreak in school, including numerous caller contributions to the Redskins debate, with suggestions of other potentially offensive team names.

The next segment began with a discussion of childhood anxieties, particularly the trauma of not receiving Valentine’s Day cards and the strict allergy policies in modern schools.  The hosts launched into crude jokes about children with disabilities, followed by complaints about school policies on Halloween costumes, birthday party passwords, and grade redos.  This segued into criticism of Reverend Al Sharpton and commentary on a police interaction video, bookended by a humorous anecdote about one host eating his own dried skin.  The segment then featured a discussion of a Chuck E. Cheese brawl,  a Criss Angel magic trick (levitating Shaq), and a lengthy, almost-entirely musical interlude playing a significant portion of Jethro Tull’s "Thick as a Brick," interspersed with discussion of the band's history and Ian Anderson's life, including a caller revealing that Anderson’s drummer had undergone a sex change, prompting further offensive comments from the hosts. The segment wrapped up with discussion and playback of a viral video called "Chinese Food" featuring young white girls singing about Chinese food, concluding with a final caller and the show's sign-off.


The third segment opened with a mixed review of the movie "Gravity," leading into a preference for an unnamed "boat movie."  This launched "Jocktober," a segment targeting the Rochester radio show "The B Morning Coffee Club" hosted by Terry Clifford and Jeremy.  The hosts anticipated a reaction from co-host "Weez," and played clips from the target show, speculating about its social media presence and a potential Facebook page shutdown.  A caller, Nick from Tennessee, offered a strange detail from a NASA photo.  The segment was unexpectedly interrupted by an in-studio visit from Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger.  A brief, somewhat awkward interview followed, featuring a humorous moment of Avril Lavigne inadvertently exposing her rear end through a studio window. Post-Avril, the hosts continued their "Jocktober" preparations, analyzing Nickelback's music and popularity (or lack thereof). The segment concluded with more "Jocktober" material about Terry Clifford and a final interview with William Shatner, who discussed his new progressive rock album, his piloting experiences (including rejecting a flight offer from Richard Branson), paramotoring, gliding, and a hawk encounter.


A later segment featured a discussion about musical tastes, specifically the hosts' dislike of disco and love of jazz, focusing on Al Di Meola.  This transitioned to a discussion of the guest’s appearances on *Columbo*, the show’s writing challenges, and its notable directors and actors, also touching on Rod Serling.  William Shatner, promoting his album "Ponder the Mystery," was the main guest. The discussion included his experiences filming *The Twilight Zone* episode "The Man on the Way Up There," special effects anecdotes, and Shatner’s piloting experience, contrasted with his fear (or lack thereof) of flying.  A humorous moment involved Anthony's attempt at a Vulcan salute at Shatner through the studio window.  The segment also included participation from recurring in-studio personalities ("Club Soda Kenny," Craig Schickle, and others), a running gag about a smudged autograph on Shatner's album, promotion of another guest's comedy shows, and a Russell Peters Netflix special.


The final segment discussed the hosts’ surprising fondness for Avril Lavigne's music. It started with a tangent about a song with confusing storylines and a caller, Matt, sharing his fantasy of Avril Lavigne fighting for his affection.  The main focus became a detailed critique of Avril Lavigne's performance of Metallica's "Fuel" at an MTV Icon tribute, with a caller, Stu, declaring his appreciation for Avril Lavigne his "most indefensible statement."  The discussion included comparisons to Korn and other pop artists, and hypothetical Avril Lavigne tattoos.  A studio intern, Nikki, joined the conversation, revealing her surprising musical preferences, including Matchbox 20.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Avril Lavigne's music, the hosts' bewilderment at their past appreciation, and a promise to tweet a photo of an old Avril Lavigne item.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What? Where did we live with them?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  An entity?  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening. It sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang over here. Don't listen to the dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know. Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone. 
[00:01:00]  Here we are.  Fud, fud, fud.  I want to praise Travis.  Praise.  I want to praise Travis.  I want to praise you.  I want to...  That's what I hear.  There it is.  My praise, I hope you need fire. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, he wants to be...  A little Fat Boy Slam.  A little praise.  Dun, dun.  He's called Dr. Gay.  And it was...  I just want to hear the part.  Like a shit. 
[00:02:00]  Children.  I remember there was an awards show.  And Fat Boy Slim was winning everything.  Yeah.  And they had a shot of Madonna in the...  I never forgot this.  In the crowd.  And she's just rolling her eyes.  Oh, really?  She didn't think he was a real, like, artist or musician.  Wow.  Anyway, I want to praise Travis because we were just talking about the Banksy thing.  And I was so sick of reading Facebook posts and tweets. 
[00:02:30]  It's like, oh, man, I wish I walked by that art stand in Central Park, man.  Yeah, he's been all over New York, I guess, for the month.  Yeah, the Banksy guy is doing a project every day.  Some of his stencil shit, some of his other shit.  Are the homies still guarding the one in East?  No, that was actually...  In East New York?  ...destroyed the morning we were talking about.  Destroyed.  What happened?  I don't know.  Somebody probably walked by and just chipped it out.  But what happened to the curators? 
[00:03:00]  I don't know.  I guess they got passed out, probably.  They got tired?  I mean...  You idiots!  They had a long night of drinking.  They were drinking a lot of malt liquor, man.  What idiots?  I'm the curator!  I fell asleep!  They had a guarantee in their neighborhood.  Now it's all going.  Oh, God.  They had a solid, solid fucking thing going.  The one he put up yesterday got tagged.  Really?  In Queens.  In Woodside.  What was that one? 
[00:03:30]  I'm one day behind.  That was a cursive writing of a gladiator quote.  Right.  What you do in life is what reflected...  Echoes in Eternity.  Right.  There's a guy washing out eternity.  Ah.  See, it's kind of like a play on what he does in his life.  Got it.  Does not echo.  No.  Costas.  Ugh.  No.  Why didn't you show me that?  But anyway, Banksy's doing one a day for the month of October here in New York City. 
[00:04:00]  And the other day, it's actually, I think, Central Park South it was set up.  I think it was like 59th Street.  Yeah.  It was, right?  Okay.  So Central Park South.  So just before you get into Central Park, there's an art stand set up with an old guy  with all this stencil art.  And it turns out it's all Banksy's shit.  Yeah.  And you could have got a Banksy for $60.  Yep.  And these things, I heard only $20,000.  Travis is saying you could get close to $100,000 for these things. 
[00:04:30]  Absolutely.  And they were just laying around at this art stand for $60.  You wouldn't give it a second glance.  Because no one knew it was a Banksy.  Wouldn't even give it a second glance as you walked past.  My point, and Travis answered this correctly, I was so sick of hearing everyone going,  Oh, man, I wish I walked by there.  I would have bought the whole thing.  No, you wouldn't.  That's the whole gag.  You wouldn't have bought anything.  I wouldn't have bought any of this.  You would have walked right by and said, Oh, did you sign them?  Huh?  Are they signed like you?  They were signed on the back.  Oh, on the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, but no one knew is the point. 
[00:05:00]  A ton of people walked by and a ton of people that, not a ton, but at least a bunch that knew  who Banksy was.  And they didn't buy any of it.  Yeah, like these are all very famous Banksy images.  Right.  And you're walking by.  If I walked by that stand, I would say, Oh, look, there's some overpriced knockoff Banksy,  which is what is intended.  But everyone thinks they're smarter than everyone else.  Oh, I would have bought.  Oh, I would have bought.  No, you wouldn't.  That's the whole bit.  And Travis answered correctly.  He goes, Thank God I didn't walk by.  Because if I walked by, saw that, and then didn't buy, and then realized what it was, 
[00:05:30]  I would have to kill myself.  Then I wouldn't be thinking that this is brilliant.  Lottery ticket.  Yeah.  Right.  Laying on the ground, didn't pick it up.  Well, it would be even worse if you bought eight and then returned them.  That sucks.  If you really would have bought them, then go on eBay today.  You can buy them for half the price from any amount of people that just make knockoffs  and sell them on eBay.  Knockoffs, yeah.  Right.  I mean, if you really were going to buy them for $60, you can go buy them for $40.  A lot of the art stands in and around such a park are knockoffs. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  You could get that really famous John Lennon picture with the Imagine t-shirt.  Mm-hmm.  You could get that.  From anyone.  From anyone.  But what?  One day you're walking by and go, Oh, I know better, so I'm buying that one because that's  the original photograph.  Yeah.  No.  See?  It's all readily available.  This isn't that big of a deal.  You could get this Banksy painting for $25 on eBay.  Wow.  Is it real?  Is it his?  It might be.  Yeah.  It's his large canvas Banksy.  Oh, really?  $25. 
[00:06:30]  Put on that one.  Oh, this one's only $33 in its color.  Start bidding.  Right.  How do people know what he was doing?  Who finally figured out what he was doing?  No one.  He posted it on his website.  He said these were originals?  Yeah.  After it was over.  Yeah.  It's a great video because it's like yesterday I set up a shop in Central Park selling 100% authentic  signed Banksy canvases.  With this old guy.  Look.  This old guy just selling them.  Next to the guy with all the shitty fucking pictures.  Three people bought them.  I actually bought that one one year.  Three people?  I'm embarrassed.  You see the one of the Poets Walk with all the different seasons? 
[00:07:00]  I bought that once.  Yikes.  You can get that at every art stand.  This guy's a pretty original thinker, man.  I can come up with that stuff.  It's a great commentary on how hype is bigger than just liking actual art.  If you like something, just buy it.  And what?  Only three people bought?  Yeah.  See the old guy's sitting there.  He's just fucking eating, waiting for his first buy.  And it's the weekend.  So there's just hundreds and hundreds of people walking by this.  Look.  They're just walking by. 
[00:07:30]  They have no idea what he's selling.  And those are all originals.  Yes.  Original spray paint canvases signed on the back.  So I can tell we're really short.  Look, see?  They're just walking by.  Like Ann said, it's sort of a lottery ticket.  Just waiting.  Just sitting there.  Waiting for you.  It's a house.  Those are really nice paintings, too.  And you look at it on the bed.  Yeah, he's talented.  Yeah, framed out of here.  Look, an old guy.  He's just yawning, waiting for a sale.  No one's buying. 
[00:08:00]  That's hilarious.  What a bunch of douchebags.  Still nobody buying.  No one's buying at one o'clock.  Only $60.  We'll put this video on our Facebook page.  He's just eating a sandwich, waiting.  Yeah.  He's...  He just hired a guy to be the seller.  People just walking back.  Just walking by.  I don't know.  But you would have been the one that would have known.  Does the old guy know who he is, you think?  Or is he part of it? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I mean, he was probably hired by...  I don't know if he knew exactly what he was doing,  but he was probably paid to...  $3.30, finally the first sale.  He's been out there all day.  A lady buys two small canvases for her children.  Only after negotiating a 50% discount.  Yeah, and negotiate it down.  So there she...  There, she's got two of them.  She's putting it...  Oh, boy.  They're putting it in a big glue bag,  and she walks off.  And Travis is saying up to $100...  That's $100,000?  For those large ones, you could...  I guarantee $100,000.  Yeah.  Wow.  The smaller ones, $10,000. 
[00:09:00]  She just walked off with two for $30.  There's college.  A piece.  Damn.  Oh, man.  Nice score right there.  At 4 o'clock, a lady from New Zealand buys two.  So it's $120 in her bag.  Worth...  $1,000.  Oh, my...  Travis is up to $100,000.  Yeah.  Each.  Each.  5.30.  A man from Chicago is decorating his new house.  I just need something for the walls, he says. 
[00:09:30]  And he buys four.  Four of them.  Oh, man.  Big ones, too.  Oh, he's rich.  You're saying that's $400,000 he's walking away with?  Possibly?  A one-off signed canvas tied to this event.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So that guy's walking off at $400,000 right there.  I mean, possibly, yeah.  And now the guy's taking his art stand down.  Especially because they're tied to this.  Six o'clock, it's closed, total takings for the day, he made $420. 
[00:10:00]  Right, just bucks.  He made $420.  Look at all those unsold canvas.  The frustrating thing is you know how much money that's worth.  Oh, my God.  You're looking at this pile of cash.  But, you know, but, you know.  It's worth as much as you're willing to pay for it.  That's true.  But you got the people that are saying they would have known.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, you would have known.  I didn't know it was a Banksy.  You would have been the guy who knew this was for real.  Shut up with your dumb name.  That fucking tweet you sent out last night was hilarious. 
[00:10:30]  It had a picture of a Banksy, which was pretty impressive.  It was Banksy from, yeah, his latest one.  I had not seen it.  And I was like, it was funny that you got a hold of it and no one else did.  Yeah, it was the latest Banksy.  Oh, you have the new one?  Yeah.  Ooh.  What do you got?  I was like, of all people to, uh, there it is.  It's the latest Banksy from the bus terminal.  Is that up on his website?  It's confirmed?  Well, no. 
[00:11:00]  Not yet.  Are you saying his art is shit, sir?  No, but it could be.  That's very, very funny.  Wow.  It looks like dinty more beef stew in a toilet bowl.  Yeah, it's pretty rank.  Well, that's pretty brilliant on Banksy's part.  Holy shit.  November is going to be such a boring month.  Compared to October.  Oh, you're going to miss Banksy?  Yeah, I'm going to be really depressed on November 1st when I don't have anything to go run to after the show.  I'm going to watch Exit Through the Gift Shop again.  Oh, shit.  It's so good.  I like a couple of these. 
[00:11:30]  I haven't seen it.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  They're good.  In years.  I do like a couple, too, yeah.  And the one with the guy that kind of, like, praying with the hood.  He's actually a really good artist.  Yeah.  Man.  I should have bought eight of these.  Yeah.  He's bought four.  That's pretty good.  That guy bought four.  Four of those is pretty fucking good.  Russ is saying that's $400,000.  Could be.  I'm saying it could be, yeah.  Even conservatively.  Even the $30,000, they say $200,000.  You see the guy tagging Banksy's work yesterday?  No.  He was not happy.  Yeah.  Keep calling him.  Listen to the people. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I guess this is the onlookers.  Oh, this is a video of somebody tagging one of his?  This is yesterday's piece.  I guess he did it at night.  So, and this is just some asshole that got there first to tag it?  But then, don't other people?  Yeah, but you know what?  It was up all day.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Don't other people tag over the other guy's tag, too?  Eventually, yeah.  Why do they tag the R?  Why do they ruin it?  They don't like Banksy.  Man!  They don't like Banksy.  They don't like Banksy.  They like Banksy.  They know this is an opportunity to get their stupid tag out there.  There's probably some jealousy to it.  There's some territorial stuff to it. 
[00:12:30]  This is my neighborhood.  Oh, yuck.  I do my insignificant tag.  It's my turf, yo.  Yuck.  My turf.  You think they used a Twitter voice as they're tagging over a Banksy?  This is my wall!  Jesus.  People are exhausting.  Oh, God.  They just are exhausting.  Let's hear this guy.  Why can't you let the Banksy fucking breathe for a few days?  How long do they stay up for?  This one was probably one of the longer ones. 
[00:13:00]  This one was up for a day, yeah.  For a day?  Nice.  That's good.  Close to 12 hours.  The one that he did with the car and the truck down on the lower east side, both car doors  are gone now.  Someone stole the car doors.  That's pretty great.  People are just fucking animals.  Someone stole the back door.  Get a lot of money for those car doors.  And then the other door was taken.  Those things are going to sell really well online.  I wonder if it was the guy who owns it that actually did it.  I don't know.  I mean, they're stolen, but you can get some money for them. 
[00:13:30]  Sure.  Not as much as it was like...  Let me see this.  So this guy is tagging a Banksy and everyone's there with their phones recording it.  Calling him an asshole.  Yeah.  Let me see this.  But they're just letting it happen. 
[00:14:00]  Ew.  Bansky.  One guy thinks that that could be Bansky.  Bansky.  Isn't that the second person that's called him Bansky?  What's going on?  I mean, look.  That would be pretty smart to have Bank...  Banks...  How do they say that?  Bansky.  Bansky take his own shit.  Why would he do it?  Why would he do it?  Awful penmanship.  What is that?  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  It's tough art critics.  Yes.  All right.  From Child NYC, Banksy Beardo.  Oh, shut up.  From Child NYC.  Damn.  That guy...  Your penmanship stinks.  Oh, that's terrible penmanship.  Why would he do that?  What an asshole.  I don't know.  Where do the people go for the Banksy shit?  We got the website.  I know he's on Instagram.  BanksyNY.com.  BanksyNY.com.  Yeah.  To follow along with what he's been doing all month here in New York City. 
[00:15:00]  It's pretty cool.  It's so much fun.  So much better before the tagging.  Oh, you stink, man.  Why would you do it?  Yuck.  AJ Pooley shit.  Yeah, just like, I'll slap you away.  Get away from that wall.  You're ruining it.  Just some chubby Asian guy painting.  It's not him if you're that messed up.  So, uh...  So there you have it. 
[00:15:30]  I'm looking forward to his, um...  Can't wait.  The next one.  To his next little thing.  Can't wait.  Yeah, they've been pretty cool so far.  You know?  What do you think he's gonna do?  Like, the grand finale?  Like, kill himself?  Yeah.  Throw himself off a building and he'll be, like, splattered on the sidewalk and it'll be a Banksy?  You guys think there's gotta be a grand finale.  Yeah, yeah.  Something very large.  Something huge.  I hope it's like David Blaine.  Something exciting like that.  Like, maybe he'll freeze himself.  Really exciting.  Fucking Blaine. 
[00:16:00]  I hope it turns out Banksy is David Blaine and then everybody hates him.  God damn it, Banksy.  Do you think if he came out and everybody knew who he was, he'd have less value on his  heart?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because the intrigue is gone.  Part of the intrigue is that he never gets caught and that nobody...  He's like...  Well, there's that one picture.  Well, I mean, there's...  So don't people know who that guy is now that that picture's out there?  It's not confirmed.  Yeah, but it's not confirmed.  But somebody knows who that person is. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Sure.  I mean, everybody knows who someone is.  It's still like a superhero.  You know what I mean?  Like, once it's like, hello, I'm the guy.  Then it's like, oh, you're just a guy painting.  He's kissed before they took their makeup off.  Is he a superhero like the mind freak?  Oh, man.  Kind of like the mind freak.  Mind freak.  Yeah, like once you find out he's just walking on plexiglass, this nail to a pool wall.  I got yelled at.  Well, that's why I bring it up.  You had to deal with those people.  The Chris Angel trick itself was kind of all right, but just how he pulls it off is so 
[00:17:00]  lame.  The presentation is horrible.  I would love to talk to the guy about it.  Like the legless woman that you turned us on to, and then she walks away on her hands?  That would never happen.  No.  It's just awful.  Way over the top.  Leave your legs behind.  I mean, you know they're all in on it.  Everyone around in his crowd, the random crowd of people, they're all in on the gag. 
[00:17:30]  They're all part of his act.  When he's walking across the pool, obviously, it's a, obviously, it's glass.  Plexiglass.  Plexiglass.  And you could swim under it.  Yeah.  And he has to show that by having a woman swim under it, and then she turns like all dramatically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, that's just not how it would go down if you want it to be believable.  I wonder if there's any people who are in repeat videos.  Anybody is in one video.  I wonder if there are people, any one of the other people who works for him.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  That would be fun to find out if you catch one.  One of the people that were really pissed off at me is apparently Tony Orlando's daughter. 
[00:18:00]  Tony Orlando's daughter.  Tony Orlando's daughter is mad at me.  She should be.  She's delightful.  Oh, I have no idea who she is.  But it seems, and then Tony Orlando's son also is pissed off at people for goofing on  the daughter because she's defending Criss Angel.  I guess Tony Orlando and Criss Angel are friends.  All right.  Good for them.  That sounds about right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does. 
[00:18:30]  But Criss Angel is a really nice guy.  We've had him on.  Yeah, but I just.  His presentation is kind of lame.  I think he's terrible.  He's a mind freak.  I think he's terrible.  That awful, heavy metal, rock and roll magician.  Fuck.  The guy makes millions off it.  Oh, I know.  That video we were watching before he was a magician.  Oh, God.  Well, he was a music video.  He was in a music video.  He's doing like fucking rock, like butt rock fucking hairband metal and magic. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  On stage.  Like, wow, look at that.  That sounds good.  Yeah.  He cut his hair.  He looks like Michael Jackson.  Oh, he cuts hair?  You are not alone video.  Yeah.  Lisa Marie Presley awkward with no shirt on.  That's how he looks now?  Yeah.  Oh, what is he doing?  He cut his hair.  He's more mysterious than ever.  That's right.  I always thought Metallica was more mysterious once they cut their hair.  Well, that's true.  That hair looks like a lot of work.  Why would you want a hairdo? 
[00:19:30]  Is that a lot of work right there?  Why would you want a hairdo that needs a lot of work?  A lot of product.  You need a lot of product.  But it's cut in such a way that you have to make sure it's exactly that way before you leave the house.  Why do you do that?  Oh, my God.  It looks stupid.  Everything he does is lame.  I feel bad because he came in and he was really nice.  He's a fellow Long Islander.  We like to support the Long Island guys. 
[00:20:00]  Is he from Long Island?  I believe so, yeah.  But the presentation, I would love to sit him down and go,  Your presentation, what are you doing?  He's way over the top.  Didn't Penn mock him on his show?  Like when he's doing, I thought during Penn and Teller they said something about him.  Yeah.  So anyway, what's up with the Orlando siblings?  Well, they're just like, you're an asshole.  He has more talent than you'll ever have.  How do you know Tony Orlando's daughter?  Because it is.  Oh, did she send you a yellow ribbon on everything she writes? 
[00:20:30]  Everything.  Her name's Candia.  Yeah, yeah.  Tony Orlando.  Tony Orlando's daughter.  It's not even Tony Orlando.  Gives me Twitter shit because I'm fucking.  What is she doing with her life?  I don't know.  I don't even fucking know.  Getting her mind freaked.  So wait.  Mind freaked, right?  Did she tweet you?  Well, she retweeted.  Okay.  One of my.  That said what?  One of my comments.  She said that Tony Orlando has. 
[00:21:00]  Tony Orlando.  That mind freak there has more followers and more fans than I ever will.  And that he's more talented than I could ever be.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's just stupid.  Kim Kardashian has.  How many?  See?  A billion.  And she doesn't even have a brain cell.  I could have thrown that at her.  She's got what?  15 million or something?  More than Tony Orlando.  More than your pops.  How old is she?  I don't know.  Oh, God. 
[00:21:30]  She's got to be ancient.  Tony Orlando's like Orlando.  Has to be pushing 80 at this point, right?  Oh, man.  Really?  Has to.  I don't think so.  Dude.  Come on.  I want to see him live in Vegas.  I want to go see Tony Orlando.  Three times.  Oh, yeah.  And I would do this on the floor.  Twice on the pipe.  Ding, ding.  He's 69.  Oh.  You had him at 80.  This is his daughter.  Is his daughter hot?  Yeah, but those guys pad.  I think he's pad in a few.  I think so. 
[00:22:00]  Come on.  He's not 69.  Tony Orlando, 69.  I don't know.  69.  69.  Yeah.  The Negro.  Oh.  Hey, girl, what you doing?  Down there.  Dancing alone.  You like this, Jim?  That's what I say when I'm getting toothy heads.  Let's go home.  It's not going to get better than that tonight.  Oh, jeez.  I can feel you fine.  This way again. 
[00:22:30]  One foot below me.  You don't even know me.  I love you.  Is that her?  Oh, my darling.  Not three times on the scene.  If you want me.  Is that Dawn singing on the background?  Yeah.  Twice on my pipe.  Yeah.  The answer is no.  No.  Oh, my sweetness.  Means you'll meet me in the hallway.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh.  She loves Criss Angel. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's going on here?  Damn.  There's a photo on her Twitter of her and a friend kissing a Criss Angel demonic painting.  A giant fucking painting.  Is that which one?  Who's got the hiney?  That's her friend.  Brunette is.  Damn.  Her friend's got a fucking.  Wait, bump.  That's a fucking hoochie mama ass.  Tony Orlando has a midget offspring.  I'm not.  How short is she?  Maybe the other chick's tall.  Are they young?  How young are they?  The other chick is a giant.  Or Tony Orlando's daughter is very, very tiny. 
[00:23:30]  She's very pretty.  Look at that.  She looks like a young Amy Fisher in that one photo.  That's all right.  Right?  Hopefully she acts like that, too.  I love a young Amy Fisher.  Oh, wow.  All right.  In that picture, she's like, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  She's attractive.  I'll give her that.  Oh, wow.  Not so much there.  What happened there?  A little more Tony Orlando in that picture.  Oh, okay.  I see what's going on.  Well, she's cute.  It depends on the angle.  You get a good angle.  This broad is hot.  She's a two-face. 
[00:24:00]  She loves the Jonas.  She's got to be looking back at you a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you get a good shot of her.  Oh, this is with, yeah, Nick Jonas, huh?  Oh, oh.  Is that your newest Twitter beef?  Tony Orlando's daughter.  That's my newest little Twitter battle.  I'm battling Tony Orlando's daughter.  Jenny Rose, I guess her name is.  Yes.  Yeah, Jenny Rose.  Read a few of her tweets.  What does she tweet about?  Well, what was she?  Criss Angel.  She apparently is the biggest Criss Angel fan. 
[00:24:30]  I didn't know.  But she...  I didn't know I was getting fucking Tony Orlando's daughter all riled up.  But she's a fan because, you know, she thinks he's a bit on the sexy side.  Well, yeah.  If Criss Angel was a pig doing those tricks, she wouldn't be a fan.  Yeah, that's true.  She likes that rock and roll.  I don't see her fucking pining over the amazing Jonathan.  Exactly.  You know?  She retweeted.  It was amazing, by the way. 
[00:25:00]  He was amazing until he did the exact amazing show for 25 years.  That's amazing, by the way.  That you can do the same act for 25 years.  It wasn't so amazing after a while.  It's like, how about you get a new amazing illusion?  Illusion.  Well, look out.  You're going to get fucking somebody all pissed off.  Charo's son will fucking come at you.  Very funny.  Fucking people.  Enough. 
[00:25:30]  Did you respond?  I was going to.  I actually had something typed out.  And I'm like, fuck it.  What am I bothering for?  It was some bash on her father, too.  Oh, wow.  Of course, I was going to...  Going right for the Joe you like.  I'm such a scumbag on Twitter.  If I'm not blocking people outright, just fucking blocking them for nothing, I'll do  horrid comments.  It's not cool to block people on Twitter, man.  I fucking...  Don't do that.  I'm a blocking machine.  Not cool, brother. 
[00:26:00]  I blocked a bunch yesterday.  It was wonderful.  It feels great.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Because you guys know, I take a different angle on the Redskins than you do, so I  was tweeting it.  And people were coming, like, being, like, dicks about, not saying, like, I don't agree  with what you're saying, but, like, you're fucking, you fake, you're against free speech.  Oh, God.  Block.  Block.  I forgot.  That's my response, by the way.  Yeah, he did.  I didn't know it was Tonya Landa's daughter when I first responded.  So she wrote, you don't even have half of his success, so please shut up. 
[00:26:30]  Also, it's Chris, C-R-I-S-S.  True.  Not C-H-R-I-S.  She's two for two in information.  Right.  And then Anthony.  I wrote, ha, ha, a dumb bitch white knight.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, um, I called her a dumb bitch.  You called Tonya Landa's daughter a dumb bitch.  Yeah.  Don't fuck with me.  So you blocked people over the Bob Costas thing? 
[00:27:00]  No, I didn't talk about Bob Costas.  I was talking about the Redskins, but Bob Costas, I don't...  You said you blocked a whole bunch of people, and I heard Bob Costas.  I'm confused now.  No, I didn't say Bob Costas.  I said, I have the Redskins.  I was talking about the Redskins, not Costas.  Oh, oh.  Even though he commented on them.  I was talking about the team.  He drives me fucking nuts.  Yeah.  Because my point on this is really, really simple.  Bob Costas should have said this 25 years ago.  You know, like his timely lectures?  No, he's just jumping on a stupid bandwagon.  If he truly felt this way, he should have said it 20, 25 years ago. 
[00:27:30]  What is he talking about?  He's really close to sports.  It's his job.  But now he's brave enough to come out because Obama said something?  I fucking hate Costas.  I've hated him for a long time.  When we were growing up, he was kind of cool, I guess.  But somewhere along the line, he went into the fucking hated category.  Yeah, I remember a point where I really liked him.  But there's something about him.  He's so douchey.  Do you believe in douchebags? 
[00:28:00]  You don't like that?  Do you believe in miracles?  No.  I like him.  That's one of the greatest sports calls ever.  What's wrong with you?  God.  You don't like the shot heard around the world either?  No.  Do you believe in miracles was awesome.  It's one of the best sports calls ever.  Yeah.  By the way, they still had to play one more game for the gold medal.  Ah, a lot of people don't know that.  A lot of people think that was for the gold medal.  Oh, no, no, no.  That was Al Michaels, by the way.  Yes, it was.  Al Michaels, who was OJ's friend. 
[00:28:30]  OJ.  The juice.  What famous thing did Bob Costas say?  He hasn't had a famous one.  He hasn't had a good one?  What's his most famous call?  Wow, I couldn't even tell you.  I couldn't even tell you.  This guy's a douche, though, man.  I mean, he should have said this 20, 25 years ago.  Uh-huh.  Now he's saying it?  What, are you kidding me?  He doesn't like the Redskins game.  Can I hear this?  Name.  Oh, here he goes.  In Washington playing Dallas here tonight, it seems like an appropriate time to acknowledge  the ongoing controversy about the name Redskins. 
[00:29:00]  Let's start here.  There's no reason to believe that owner Daniel Snyder or any official or player from his team  harbors animus toward Native Americans who wishes to disrespect them.  I harbor animus over there at North Point.  This is undoubtedly also true of the vast majority of those who don't think twice about the longstanding moniker.  And in fact, as guests can be determined, even a majority of Native Americans say they are not offended.  But, having stipulated that, there's still a distinction to be made.  What do you mean, but?  Objections to names like great. 
[00:29:30]  There's no but after that.  Right.  That is the argument.  If most Native Americans don't have a problem with this, then shut your fucking mouth.  Don't have a problem with it.  The team owner and the fans and whatnot aren't using it animus.  There's no animus.  And that's it.  There.  Now, but.  And here comes his fucking fake.  And his but is always so stupid.  His fake morality.  And self-serving bullshit.  His butt always takes two minutes.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  His butt always takes two minutes.  Yes. 
[00:30:00]  And who said it?  It was said brilliantly.  He talks to you like he's talking down to you.  Yeah.  Like you're not on the same intelligence level as a Bob Costas.  I would hate him as a kid.  Oh, his kid must be like, oh, my dad's a dick.  Right.  You can't just discuss it.  He's, he, yeah, all right.  I said it.  Yeah, his kid must harbor animus to him.  Sure.  Animus.  Chiefs, Chiefs, Warriors, and the like, strike many of us as political correctness run amok.  These nicknames honor rather than demean. 
[00:30:30]  They're pretty much the same as Vikings, Patriots, or even Cowboys.  And names like Blackhawks, Seminoles, and Chippewas.  Well, tell me one thing the Vikings did that was positive.  Well.  Killed people.  Nice hats.  Holy fuck.  Fucked a lot of chicks.  Made a lot of cool boats.  Yeah.  I'm not saying.  I'll see the boat movie.  I'm not saying what they did was, you know.  I'll see the boat movie.  And they built kick-ass boats.  They did. 
[00:31:00]  Were the Vikings positive in the end?  They were.  Capital One commercials.  They were brutal.  They were pretty brutal.  The Vikings were brutal.  Very conquering people.  Let's learn about Vikings today.  I really don't know what.  I don't know the positive spin on the Vikings thing.  Yeah, but I don't think there's any Vikings left.  But he's not saying like, I think he's saying like.  He's showing the comparison.  The names.  Like Vikings is just a name.  They're Vikings.  If it was murderous Vikings, then they'd be like, oh, wow. 
[00:31:30]  That's, you know.  He's using the argument that people have been using.  Like he's kind of using that.  Like he's giving the example that people have been.  Because people are saying, how come Vikings isn't offensive?  How come Cowboys isn't offensive?  How come that's not offensive?  Well, I think he's saying because those are just names and some of them do honor the bravery of the Indians and whatnot.  But Redskins, he's saying, is out of that category.  It's an insult.  It's a slur.  Let's hear him say.  I didn't realize he was separating them. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course he is.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Seminoles and Chippewas, while potentially more problematic, can still be okay, provided the symbols are appropriately respectful.  Which is where the Cleveland Indians, with the combination of their name and Chief Wahoo logo, can sometimes run into trouble.  Sometimes Chief Wahoo.  Mostly in the college ranks, have changed their names in response to objections.  The Stanford Cardinal and the Dartmouth Big Green were each, once the Indians. 
[00:32:30]  The St. John's Redmen have become the Red Storm.  And the Miami of Ohio Redskins, that's right, Redskins, are now the Red Hawks.  Still, the NFL franchise that represents the nation's capital has maintained its name.  But think for a moment about the term Redskins, and how it truly differs from all the others.  Ask yourself what the equivalent would be if directed toward African Americans.  Blackskins. 
[00:33:00]  Asians.  Browskins.  Yellowskins.  Yellowskins.  When considered that way, Redskins can't possibly honor a heritage or a noble character trait.  Nor can it possibly be considered a neutral term.  It's an insult, a slur, no matter how benign the present day is.  Well, he changed my mind.  Okay.  It's fair to say that for a long time now, and certainly in 2013, no offense has been intended.  But if you take a step back, isn't it clear to see how offense might legitimately be taken? 
[00:33:30]  Offense.  For more on this topic, including Daniel Snyder's take.  He's irritating.  He's irritating because he should have said this years ago.  Sorry, Dan.  What, what, things have just changed?  It's the same shit.  I know.  The Redskins had the same meaning when he was broadcasting way back in the day.  And I've also heard that, you know, they would paint their faces red to go into battle.  Ugh.  So what's the true meaning of them, of the term Redskins? 
[00:34:00]  I don't know.  I've heard many different things.  I've heard that's how they got ready for battle.  Right.  Part of his smugness, too, is the way he looks at the camera.  He's a dick.  As if to say, admit it, I'm right and you're wrong.  I'm right.  Why don't you know better, but you're wrong.  Yes, he's a dick.  What bothers me about it is it's not that I'm offended by it.  Or I don't think, oh, it's politically incorrect.  Of course not.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the fact that they grovel in the NFL. 
[00:34:30]  Like, fucking, that Eagles player says nigger at a Kenny Chesney concert and it gets a different team.  He has to apologize.  Oh, it's crazy.  Like, they're so selective where they show bravery.  Like, if they started cartooning other cultures, I would be 100% behind them.  But I would love to see how the team would handle that if that player was on the Redskins.  Same way.  I guarantee it's the same way.  We don't know for sure because this guy's hanging in there.  The same way.  Most people would have caved by now, by the way. 
[00:35:00]  Most owners would have caved by now.  This is a special situation.  This guy's like, fuck you.  I'm not changing the name.  But eventually they will when that guy's long gone.  No, I think he's going to change it.  Yeah.  You think?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Oh, God.  But look at other teams.  See, but then they're going to go after something else, Jimmy.  That's why, I mean, this is never going to end.  It's rare that I agree with it.  It's almost like, and I hate political correctness so much.  But you're giving them too much fucking power because then they're going to go after the  next fucking thing.  That American Indian. 
[00:35:30]  Again, that Chief Wahoo.  Chief Wahoo.  Put a fucking Chinese face or a black, you can't, if they started doing that.  I think we should.  I would, you know what?  I'd be fine with that.  Should be allowed to do that.  I'd be totally fine with that.  This is just really, just horrific images and names.  You're making a great argument, but the problem is that you know how these people are and you  know they're not going to stop.  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  So I want to keep it just how it is because why give these fucking guys any more power? 
[00:36:00]  Because in this way.  I mean, and the Indians logo is way worse than the Redskins.  I don't, I don't have a problem with either one, but the, the Indians logo, they're goofing  on the Indian.  He looks like a complete jackass in that logo.  It's all cartoony with a dumb look on his face.  Dumb smile.  Big teeth.  Big teeth and nose.  Right.  Chief Wahoo.  That's way more insulting, I think.  If they, if they end up changing the Redskins name, you have to think that's the next thing  to go.  Of course.  Why the Indians are still dealing with this shit? 
[00:36:30]  Because they don't have the fucking, the same voice that blacks have or other special  interest groups, or they haven't had the same political influence.  So people just kind of, ah, fuck them.  Just, that, it just annoys me because they're taking shit and we don't give it to anybody  else.  Be brave everywhere.  This guy, Jason in Detroit says there are high schools on reservations with the name  Redskins.  Oh.  Is that true?  Can we look that up?  Crazy.  Ah, let's say hi to Jason in Detroit.  Ah, we lost him, alright.  Whatever.  The D. 
[00:37:00]  It's hard to take the side of the politically correct side.  It's not comfortable for me to take that side.  But I've been saying this for years about this.  I'm not jumping on this.  For fucking years I've said that I hated that name and I thought it was shitty.  Ever since I saw that group of American Indians explaining themselves, and it was fucking  on Donahue or whatever it was.  Right.  It made me think different about it, that's all.  Well, the St. John's Redmond changed to the Red Storm.  Yeah.  A storm, an actual storm has affected a lot of fucking people in this area. 
[00:37:30]  Redmond never did any of those people harm, but a super storm called Sandy certainly did.  So wouldn't those people be offended by the name change?  They watch F Troop, they got the Hakawi Indians, and they got that name because they were  lost, and they said, where the Hakawi?  It's like, who are you?  And they go, where the Hakawi?  And they're like, oh, you're the Hakawi Indians. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, I like that.  We got one.  We got one.  Don in Michigan.  Don.  Is that Don on the phone?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Here comes a doozy, by the way.  Go ahead, Don.  Hey, I think women should be offended by the Detroit Red Wings.  Well, they're in the name.  I know.  I want to.  All right.  That's pretty good.  I wanted to hate it, but okay.  The Red Wings.  The Red Wings.  Yes, they fly on the wings of a maxi, and then if they have a heavy flow day, those wings 
[00:38:30]  might get a little red.  Red Wings.  Yeah, exactly.  Gotcha.  It's all over your face.  It's a good time.  Right.  I don't think these teams are being pussies by not going after other groups.  I mean, Indians were fucking warriors, man.  We all grew up thinking Indians were warriors.  Their argument is that redskins is a slur.  Right.  That's their only argument.  But the Native Americans are saying they don't give a fuck about it.  Some do, some don't.  Yeah, some care, some don't.  But it's just their lack. 
[00:39:00]  It's not that they don't want them to go after.  Like, if one of their players said faggot in the locker room and a reporter heard it,  the team would make them apologize and grunt.  Like, if the Redskins stood tall and said, you know what, we don't care what you say,  or if the NFL said, you know what, that guy said nigger at a concert, so what?  It's not our business.  Right.  Then I would feel differently.  But they're fucking such selectively brave examples, little moments of bravery.  I don't think they're being brave.  I think they made these team names a long time ago, not thinking they were being brave 
[00:39:30]  or edgy.  I think they had these names because it was powerful for their team.  I think at the time, you're probably right.  But why no blackface?  How about the fucking Zulus?  Why not a blackface on the side of a helmet?  That would rock.  I would do that.  Why not, though?  You know how much merch they would sell?  Oh, man.  My God.  They wouldn't do it.  They should have the Zulus.  That would be a good team.  Were the Zulus that good, though?  Yeah, they're pretty tough.  They were pretty kick-ass.  I didn't learn about the Zulus growing up.  I learned about Native Americans, though.  Hard to fight once you, you know.  But it's just getting... 
[00:40:00]  Floated guns in there when they're still throwing spears.  But yeah, they did pretty good for what they had.  The whole thing is ridiculous is what I'm getting at.  I mean, you can't even say, you know, sit Indian style anymore.  It's criss-cross applesauce.  I witnessed that for the first time in my son's school.  I wanted a pew.  The teacher goes, okay, everyone sit criss-cross applesauce.  What does it have to do with applesauce?  It rhymes.  It could have been tomato sauce.  Very offensive to Italians. 
[00:40:30]  And reflux Americans.  Reflux Americans.  But isn't that how Indians sat?  Yeah.  So why is that a problem?  How else do you sit on the floor?  Yeah.  They didn't have chairs back then.  Engine style.  They had logs.  Yeah.  They would sit on the ground.  You'd squat.  And it's pretty impressive to sit like an Indian.  It's not easy on the back.  Criss-cross applesauce.  That's what they say now. 
[00:41:00]  It's unbelievable.  That's ridiculous.  And then I was watching a show the other day,  and instead of saying shut the fuck up,  obviously you can't say that,  they said shut the front door.  Shut the front door.  What does that mean?  I've never heard that.  That's been around for a while.  It's so stupid, though.  But it sounds like you're going to say shut the fuck up.  Right.  Shut the front door.  Oh.  How about cheese and rice instead of Jesus Christ?  Cheese and rice.  Is that?  Oh, yeah.  That's terrible. 
[00:41:30]  Cheese and rice is terrible.  But wouldn't the Lord be mad  because he knows exactly what you meant to say there?  Jesus knows.  Jesus knows.  You actually were going to say Jesus Christ.  Yes.  Bull spit.  Bull spill.  Bull spit.  Since the Cowboys killed so many Indians,  shouldn't they change their name, too?  Oh.  That's a great point there, Bill, Georgia.  The whole thing is ridiculous.  Cowboys.  You can look at almost every team.  Right.  They were drunken thugs, most of them.  Cowboys.  Right?  You think Cowboys were ethical? 
[00:42:00]  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  There's one episode of Bonanza the other day  and a bunch of cowpoke came into a town  and they had to shut the town down.  Damn it.  Because they go crazy.  And then the people were pissed off  that the mayor and the sheriff shut the town down.  So they said, fuck you.  We're going to open the town  because we want to make money off of these cowpokes.  And they opened the town and you know what happened?  They trashed the fucking place.  Of course they did.  And they were like, I told you so.  Told you. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah, Cowboys were a little fucking crazy.  Matt in New York has something on the Redmen.  I don't know if this is true.  I'm going to learn something today.  Go, Matt.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  The reason why they were known as the Redmen  had nothing to do with Indians.  They wore red shorts  and they were known as the Redmen  and then all the time  they adopted the whole Indian thing.  Oh, I heard that too.  Yeah, yeah.  They had nothing to do with it.  And the NCAA forces in the district  because they won't give them money.  Huh?  I think they were named after Redman. 
[00:43:00]  Redman.  The rapper.  Oh.  Look at Redman.  He's fucking...  He loves his weed.  Look at...  He's sniffing some bud right there.  He had the best episode of Cribs.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  You thought Syracuse had a ridiculous team name  when they were the Orange Men?  The Orange Men.  Until they changed this to just the Orange.  Why did they change it?  Because the women teams.  Oh, because men.  Because they didn't want the women's sports  to be called Orange Men.  Then call them Orange.  So now everyone is just called...  We're just... 
[00:43:30]  What?  There was a time that the women's basketball team  were called the Orange Men?  Technically all teams were just the Orange Men.  How about the Orange Women  or the Orange for the Women?  Why did they ruin the men's?  That's for you.  That's...  Now everything is just the Syracuse Orange.  Why does Syracuse have to be fucking uniform like that?  It's just one Orange.  Call them what they are.  The Bull Dykes.  Because it goes back to my point.  Everyone's losing their minds with this PC shit.  That's why I try to defend all of it in the end.  The Orange.  It's ridiculous.  And look at their mascot.  It's just an orange blob.  Don't shit on Otto. 
[00:44:00]  Terrible.  It's Otto the Orange.  Otto the Orange.  Oh, is he an orange?  He's an orange.  Like, you eat.  Right, he's Otto the Orange.  There's nothing like...  There's nothing strong about an orange representing your team.  And it's one.  It's not even the oranges.  Like, there's a bunch of them.  Some goofy guy has to dress in the orange costume, and that's supposed to show strength  for your fucking athletic team?  We are an orange!  Oh, wow!  Look out.  Look out, everyone. 
[00:44:30]  Who wins in a fight?  It's the Warriors versus an orange.  One orange.  One.  One orange.  Let me say hi to Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin.  Good morning, boys.  Glad you're back.  Hey, I think the New York Yankees should change their name, because Yankees burn cities to  the ground and start civilians.  So, if it's good for the Redskins, it's good for the New York Yankees.  But Yankees was pretty much, that wasn't a good term if you were from the South.  Yeah, this guy's doing what I used to do when I was 13 years old, when I would argue 
[00:45:00]  with my mom, and I would try to make what I thought was a really bright point, which  was word-twisting the other way.  But you and I both know the difference.  Like, it's easy to, you could take any team and cleverly go, well, technically, didn't  they, what about when the, and you know, we could do that and play wordplay and semantics  games, but we all know the difference.  Yeah, I know.  Let's.  That guy.  No, no.  All right. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mike in Frisco.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, just a little interesting story.  So, you know, Columbus Day was yesterday, obviously, right?  Supposedly still holiday in the United States.  Well, San Francisco, probably about 10 years ago, actually banned the name, and they used  to have a parade.  They still have a parade.  It's called the Italian Heritage Day now.  They got rid of the name Columbus Day because of the Indians fucking protested it so many 
[00:46:00]  times.  But then, you know what?  They don't have the parade at all, because that's what happened.  That's the only reason you're having a parade.  Right.  That he came to America.  And, quote, discovered it, even though there were people here already.  A country raping murderer by any other name.  Right.  It's also that fucking heritage shit I hate, too.  Yeah, I know.  Like, why are you going to celebrate your heritage, but you get mad if everybody lumps criminals  into the same category as you?  Right.  But you don't mind accepting all their good shit.  Yeah.  Right.  So, I hate those heritage parades, too.  They stink.  Then cancel the fucking parade, man.  It's a waste of fucking... 
[00:46:30]  A bunch of traffic tied up.  People can fucking march down the streets.  Columbus came to America, discovered it, and then, you know, brought his boys, and they  fucking slaughtered everybody that was here before they were here.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  That's what you did back then.  So, you either celebrate that, or you just don't have the parade.  Or you just don't have the parade.  Exactly.  Or you get still out there, and he'll make sure the parade happens.  Exactly.  I've seen him in Sopranos with the Columbus Day protest. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Gotta tell you, somebody's got a good point about the Jets.  Oh!  My team, the Jets, who look fucking shitty against the fucking Steelers!  I think we're going to be playing some semantics games here.  Nope.  Okay, cool.  No, we're not.  Eddie in Georgia.  Eddie.  Hey, what about the Jets?  Didn't they take down the World Trade Center?  There you go.  There you go.  That's true.  There you go.  Change the name.  Change the name.  Right.  True.  Yeah, you could pretty much get every single name. 
[00:47:30]  Sure.  13-year-old Jimmy always could.  I bet he was adorable, too.  Oh, I thought I was a little lawyer.  Well, Mom.  A little lawyer.  Jesus.  Well, you know how immature.  I think if most of the Native Americans don't have a problem with this,  then let's move on to something else, period.  Yeah.  Period.  Why give Bob Costas his stupid moment?  Bob Costas is an ass. 
[00:48:00]  What a fucking douchebag.  And this leads to the other thing that I was telling Travis about,  about the invites at school.  Oh, yeah.  And you've told me that this has been going on for a while,  but I've seen it for the first time.  Yeah, I've heard of this for a while.  Like, invite all the class-to-birthday parties.  Oh, God.  Yeah, this is...  Or, don't invite anybody.  Don't invite anybody.  Shoot, shoot, shoot, 20 years later.  Or don't invite anybody.  So, you have to invite the entire class,  or you can't invite anybody.  That's ridiculous.  My, uh... 
[00:48:30]  It's part of growing up.  Yeah, so spend a shitload of money.  Scorned.  Or, you know, just don't have a party.  We're all gonna...  They just want us all to be the same fucking person eventually.  Everyone's a friend.  My kid started school recently,  and the birthday invites have gone out.  He's been invited to one, I think.  And he hasn't been invited to others.  Guess what?  He don't give a fuck, and we don't give a fuck.  That means we have a free Saturday.  I don't want to go to birthday parties every fucking Saturday. 
[00:49:00]  You know what a birthday party is?  It's a bill.  Yes!  You have to go buy a gift for someone.  It's a waste of fucking time.  It's a waste of time.  The whole day is fucking shot, right?  And when his birthday comes around,  I already know which kids in his class I'll invite.  All of them.  No!  All the white ones.  I don't want all of them there.  No, I don't want them all there.  Of course not.  I'll invite the ones that he's obviously getting along with.  That's how the world works.  Why is my voice so high? 
[00:49:30]  Wow, they really are...  Yeah, I've heard the same thing about bringing treats to school.  Or like, oh, that's where I heard it.  Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day.  Bring everyone a Valentine.  Everyone needs a Valentine.  Or you can't get them.  That's where you got your crushing blows in school.  That's how you learned that people sucked.  And that you couldn't always get what you wanted.  And that pretty girl that you wished gave you a Valentine didn't.  You can't always get what you want.  Exactly. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, it was Valentine's Day heartbreaking.  It was just the worst.  It really was the worst.  Oh, please, I hope she gives me...  And she don't even know who you are.  And she hands a Valentine to the other guy.  Or you get that friend Valentine.  Oh, God.  Did you have an empty locker?  I had an empty locker.  I never got Valentine's.  I opened up that locker hoping for a miracle.  No little hearts for the opester.  We used to have them just like right on our desk.  You know, you make the little mailbox on your desk. 
[00:50:30]  No, mine was empty.  Some people just had a shitload.  It is nice that the really good-looking people are getting knocked down to the rest of our level, though.  The thing that makes them special, which is only their looks and their dogshit personality does nothing.  Now you get the same amount of cards on the desk as I do.  Now what?  Fuck, I'll do it.  Now what are you going to do?  You get shit handed to you all the whole life.  Everybody treats you better because you're handsome or you're pretty.  Now you got five and I got five. 
[00:51:00]  What?  I think disappointment builds character.  Period.  It builds fucking character.  You need a little of that.  A little disappointment.  You're going to lose some of these fucking sporting events.  Yeah.  You're not going to fucking get the invite to the birthday party from the cool kid.  You're not going to get the Valentine's Day card from the hot chick.  No, you're not.  That hurt.  No, you are now.  Because this is where we're going with all this shit.  It's phony, though.  My school.  She don't want to be your Valentine.  It's going to be really crushing because when you get that I choo choo choos you card and you find out she doesn't choo choo choos you at all. 
[00:51:30]  No.  Yes, then you realize she meant choo choo choos you and it's for Penn Stein.  You can't bring in treats for your fellow classmates anymore?  I mean, you can't bring in anything.  Because of this new thing called the peanut allergy, which, by the way, we didn't have growing up.  I want to say that again.  Yeah, my kid, she can't bring any peanuts into her class.  Well, okay.  Because one kid has a...  All right, then tell the kid to stay home. 
[00:52:00]  Everyone's going to enjoy some peanut butter cookies.  That's a peanut butter Tuesday.  That's all I'd bring in is peanut butter stuff.  All right, here's a bag of peanut butter dust.  And I'd kick it in the air.  Holy shit.  Yeah, bring peanut butter cookies for everyone and celery for that weirdo kid.  Here's your celery as we enjoy peanut butter cookies.  I do feel like the peanut butter allergy thing might be the exception since kids' throats close.  Yeah, maybe.  There's physical evidence. 
[00:52:30]  It was just called asthma when we were growing up.  I'll give you asthma.  We didn't have this, is my point.  We didn't have one kid drop to the ground because he ate a peanut butter cookie while we were growing up.  And there were peanuts everywhere.  Everywhere!  In my shit.  They had peanuts in everything growing up.  We didn't have kids rolling around on the ground.  No.  Trying to find an EpiPen.  Yeah, a bunch of EpiPens coming out.  Little fucking kid EpiPens slamming them into their leg. 
[00:53:00]  Can't sell Snickers in school anymore.  Yeah, it's...  The name?  It's because of the name?  Yeah.  Sounds too close.  It's like that Louie bit, you know.  I love the Louie bit.  We played it recently, too.  And we got a kid in my extended family that's got the peanut thing going on.  So, but, with that said, it's just completely ridiculous.  It's probably all the Wi-Fi that did it.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what changed, but...  You're right about that. 
[00:53:30]  George Washington Carver just getting fucked over again.  Do you remember a goddamn white people?  A guy comes up with his peanut, peanuts his whole fucking life, and then white people  got to fuck it all up with their dumb peanut allergy, and now they can't even experience  the wonder that is the peanut.  The wonderful peanut that he worked his whole life's fucking work was the peanut.  Oh, God damn.  Do you remember one kid?  White people.  Do you remember one kid growing up that had some issue with food?  Every once in a while, maybe, and you'd hear him go, I gotta go to get a better... 
[00:54:00]  I gotta go get a better tool at the nurse's office.  I'm feeling a little stuffed up.  That was nothing compared to...  Because I grew up in the realm of mainstreaming kids with mental and physical handicaps.  Nice.  And they'd put them in our regular classrooms.  So a peanut allergy would have been nothing compared to the kid with the giant light bulb  head and the fucking pupils that looked like goat eyes, and he'd swing his head around  like this all day. 
[00:54:30]  Why does that kid have to be in school?  No one's gonna hire him.  I don't know.  And then there was another kid.  He wasn't really a midget.  He just looked like a squished kid.  Like his head was squished.  He looked like he should have been going, meh, meh, shit.  And he was a kid.  Like a Dick Tracy villain.  Yeah.  And he was real short.  He should have had a fedora on.  Meh, meh.  One of them is talking to his friend, and he's going, and this other guy had an afro and  played with dolls.  Cried all the time.  Cried a lot.  He was a queer.  Old pissy eyes. 
[00:55:00]  He was so queer.  We had one girl in our high school.  She was so handicapped that it looked like she was walking around in a drum kit.  She had so much shit going on around her.  Oh, she had like a cage with wheels on it.  It was everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  Well, they didn't make the wheelchairs as well as they do today.  No.  They were the kids that had the fucking key to the elevator around their neck.  You know, they had the little key, and they'd wheel around in the wheelchair, kind of, 
[00:55:30]  oh.  And all the black kids tried to get rides in the elevators.  Of course.  Yes, they would.  Of course they would.  She went down to my school.  I ain't walking up no stairs.  The good old days.  All this shit built character.  It did build some character.  I'll tell you that.  My kids' school, no Halloween costumes.  I still don't know why.  I've got to find out.  We can do that.  Is it the mask thing?  You're allowed to.  Yeah, we're having a Halloween party.  I don't know, because why wouldn't you just say, costumes, no masks?  Why no masks?  Ah, because it's a school shooting.  It's a safety issue, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  With your, oh, oh, oh.  I'm sure it's a safety issue for, like, to see, visually, if you're walking.  Oh, sure.  Remember those horrible, like, cheap plastic masks we had growing up?  Oh, yeah.  And what they smelled like from your breath?  Yeah.  And your breath and your, and your runny nose?  You're running across the street with fucking, like, you have horse blinders on.  You can't see shit.  Those are horrible.  Staples are just poking in your stomach.  I had a piece of elastic. 
[00:56:30]  I had a big head, so the elastic would always break and smack me in my head.  It'd hurt so bad.  You have a big head.  I had a big head, and that little band would snap and just whip me in the side of my head.  You have a fucking HGH head.  You have a fucking freakishly fast-growing head.  Couldn't keep that little mask on.  Ah, shit.  I wasn't using that yet.  Birthdays, they can't even talk about it in school.  They need a password.  What does that mean?  What?  Hold on, man.  We go down this road a bunch, I understand.  But I like when we get new shit. 
[00:57:00]  Jim in Pennsylvania, go ahead.  Yeah, today, so a kid's feelings aren't hurt for not being invited to the birthday party.  Your kids now have to have a special password amongst them.  And if they want to talk about the birthday party, they can't say, oh, tonight, the birthday party, we're doing this.  They have to say some other word.  Yeah.  Fuckfest.  Fucking child orgy.  Beat the minority party we're having. 
[00:57:30]  They just make it even worse.  We're having an exclude that retard party.  Basically, they want your kid to suck from a tit until they turn 18 years old.  Yeah.  Well, 18, how about 22?  Because this shit's going on in college, too.  It's unbelievable.  Aren't they raising the age of...  Yeah, what is it, 26 now or something?  Yeah, of adolescence.  No, adolescence.  Yeah, in the UK.  Well, of course they have to.  Because we're raising a whole bunch of fucking pussies.  But if you listen to this radio show, you're the exception to the rule. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yes, of course.  Is that also because we live longer, you think?  Like, everything is relative to how long you live?  I think they're saying that you're not done maturing at 18.  Maybe they're right.  Maybe they're right.  Of course they're right.  You're right, but that doesn't mean you change the name of what it is.  I think it's strictly for, like, child psychologists.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Fucking.  Let's say hi to Robin in Delaware.  She's a regular to the Opie and Anthony show.  I recognize you, Robin. 
[00:58:30]  Hi, good morning.  Good morning, Robin.  Hi, Robin.  Hi, Robin.  I'm a teacher, and basically we are dumbing down the kids so much that they have a policy  now where they can redo any assignment that they want and then get the higher grade, no  matter what.  Sick.  Redo it and then get the higher grade.  That's great.  I love it.  I wish I had that option.  Yeah, it would be cool.  Trust me.  We wish we had that.  Yeah, I would never do my homework. 
[00:59:00]  Just scribble in some bullshit and then be like, oh, I'll just fix it later.  Yeah.  Well, and it's for tests and stuff, and they have to be given the same test.  So if you give a kid a test, and they get like a 20 on it, then they can redo it and  they get the higher grade.  And also, they can actually not get lower than a 50, no matter what.  So even if they do nothing, they get a 50.  Wow.  I would love those rules.  What the fuck?  Then with the curve, you're getting like an 80.  Nice.  I remember the big fucking F.  I like the curve.  The big red F. 
[00:59:30]  Was that fucking great coming around for the whole class to see?  Claring.  And the teacher, you would be so angry about it.  You could tell there was like some fucking...  It was like Mr. Hand when he was handing it out.  F.  F.  I remember sitting at my desk just being, please be a D.  Please be a D.  Please be a D.  I got a...  It was like a 32.  They put the F would be in red.  You did a big red F.  I got a...  You failed. 
[01:00:00]  I got a 30 on a quiz on fractions once.  And my teacher gave it back to me.  And he goes, Sam, what happened here?  This quiz was like a gift.  Oh, I remember that.  You're stupid.  You're so stupid.  I know.  It would make you feel bad.  Oh, yeah.  It's bad enough you got the F.  Then they got to make it hurt.  Did you study?  One time in college, RoboCop was my teacher.  Right.  I heard about that.  Literally, the guy that played RoboCop was your teacher.  I can't remember.  Weller.  Peter Weller. 
[01:00:30]  Peter Weller.  He was my teacher in Roman Empire Through Film class.  And he gave us quizzes.  Roman Empire Through Film?  Yeah.  He gave us quizzes every week.  Niche class.  And I would never read the books or watch the films.  So I would just take the quizzes.  He wants...  And it was like a 200-person class.  In front of the entire class, he once handed me back a quiz and said,  Sam, you got to crack a book, man.  Oh, wow.  But I thought it was awesome because he was the RoboCop.  That is awesome.  Yes, sir.  He knows me.  I called my dad and told me. 
[01:01:00]  RoboCop now knows who I am.  Citizen.  You fail.  Oh, shit.  I was like, you were in Buckaroo Banzai.  Well, that's why he's teaching now.  You got to crack a book, man.  Now he's on Sons of Anarchy.  And I was like, that guy told me to crack a book.  Oh, he's making a comeback.  Yeah, he was in Dexter for a season.  All right.  Good for him.  Let's go to Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe.  Yeah, hey, hi, hi.  Hey, hold on.  Because you reminded me of something, Philly.  Do you got the cops talking to the Utes? 
[01:01:30]  Are you talking to me?  Yeah.  No.  We'll find it during the break.  I guess the cops did a little stop and frisk.  This was Reverend Al's big...  It was on crutch.  This is Reverend Al's big thing.  At 6 o'clock, I got to just say this.  At 6 o'clock, you can't watch a news program.  Because Reverend Al's on, who's horrendous.  Because everything's black to him.  Yeah.  And then you got probably the worst news show ever invented.  They brought Crossfire back.  Have you seen this yet? 
[01:02:00]  No, I haven't.  How awful it is?  I haven't even seen it.  And it's someone we like.  S.E. Cups is one of the hosts.  Yeah.  But they're strangling her.  The show looks bad.  The pacing of it, the rhythm of it is horrendous.  I don't think anyone's watching.  I haven't.  And S.E. Cups is talented.  But she's not going to make it with that show.  I'm telling you right now.  The show's horrible.  And now we lost a guy.  What channel is that?  The guy in Pennsylvania.  CNN.  Oh, that's CNN.  She has a gig on CNN? 
[01:02:30]  That's good.  Yeah, gross, man.  But it's horrible, man.  They got Newt Gingrich, who could be entertaining in small doses.  But now he's got to carry a fucking news show every day.  His delivery is horrible for that shit.  Yeah, he's a hateable guy, Newt Gingrich.  So then I went to Reverend Al because I just wanted to fucking be angry at him.  Yeah.  That's what happens when you watch him.  Oh, yeah.  And then you got some cops that are doing a little stop and frisk in Philadelphia.  And I think they had every right to ask these kids what they were doing in the neighborhood.  Some teens.  And then the one kid was filming. 
[01:03:00]  And this is where the cops fucked up.  They said, you know, get rid of that fucking camera.  We don't want to be fucking filming.  Yeah.  So the youth was smart enough to go, all right.  And he just put it in his pocket.  It was still recording.  Wood shampoo.  And then he caught the cops going, we don't want you here.  Hey, maybe they don't.  We'll get the clip for the next break.  But Reverend Al goes, all dramatically, he looks into the camera and goes, we will be watching  this one very closely.  And gives those eyes.  Like, don't fuck with me and my people. 
[01:03:30]  Meanwhile, there's a bunch of pastors up there in Harlem that want to fucking throw him out.  Yeah, I saw that.  They're all pissed off at him.  Why?  Because they're saying he's just self-serving and he's just looking for publicity.  He's not doing anything for the community.  The community.  Why didn't MSNBC give him a show?  Well, not only do they give him a show, I noticed something that has changed recently  with Reverend Al, because I do take a peek.  Everyone that goes on that show has to address him as Reverend.  Reverend? 
[01:04:00]  It's so stupid.  And some will shorten and go, Rev.  But something was said to all these guests that that's how you address Mr. Sharpton.  I call him race baiter.  The guy's a twat.  Oh, yeah.  He really is a twat.  You get the picture signed?  I don't think he came in that day.  Oh.  I got a good picture with him when I was, my fat face, he was coming off a roast dais.  He's a twat, but you're going to get that picture signed.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I don't know, I think he'd sign it. 
[01:04:30]  He will, he don't give a fuck.  If not.  All right.  What is that?  Is that the thing?  It's 16 minutes.  No, they had a shorter version.  Maybe, um...  Oh, God.  That's just stringy skin from my mouth.  Oh, hell.  Oh, God damn it!  Do it.  Would you eat that?  Stop it.  Oh, he's in his mouth.  Look at him, he's eating it.  Oh, it was in my mouth already, so I might as well...  Yeah, it's already.  It's part of you.  Might as well digest it now. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, fuck.  Cannibal.  It's cannibalistic.  Oh, so where were we?  The school where you can't...  You gotta either invite all the kids or none.  Yeah.  That's so stupid.  And I'll end it like I always do.  Like, I've been doing my own research now that I have a kid in school.  The parents don't want this shit.  No.  And I really thought for all these years before I had, you know, kids, that it was the fucking  parents being wimpy. 
[01:05:30]  They're not the ones, I'm telling you.  Somebody in the article...  Who are catering to the minority in this country for whatever reason.  They make a great point that, you know, for the average parent, do you want to pay for  five kids to do something at a birthday party, or do you want to pay for 30 kids to do something  at a birthday party?  Birthday parties get expensive.  Not if it's BYOB.  True.  My kid was in a dumb little program before actual school, and we decide, fuck it, if  it was a small classroom, we'll invite everybody.  And then I'm at the birthday party going, he's not going to be friends with any of these 
[01:06:00]  kids.  It just looks impressive that he had a lot of kids at his party.  But you're right, it was really fucking expensive, too.  Yeah, do you want to bring 30 kids to Chuck E. Cheese?  No!  Yes!  Bring five or six.  Yeah.  That's a great place where black people go to fight.  Chuck E. Cheese.  There's so many great videos on World Stock Hip Hop.  There's a Chuck E. Cheese in Hempstead.  Oh, boy.  That we stopped at one day.  No!  Yeah, and they have a sign outside their door that says, guns are not allowed. 
[01:06:30]  How to Chuck E. Cheese!  Amazing.  You should have taken a picture of that.  I should have.  We'll go back.  There's such great videos of just...  I saw one where a woman was actually holding a baby and swinging the other arm, punching  some other woman as she's holding a child in her hand.  It's just astounding.  Love it.  I might have great news for you, Anthony Cumia.  What?  Did you see the Criss Angel clip? 
[01:07:00]  I was just checking my Twitter real fast.  Which one?  Well, have you seen the new Criss Angel where he levitates Shaq?  No.  No.  I haven't.  Hold on.  I'm checking.  I might have talked too soon here.  Tony Orlando.  Oh, yeah.  He's doing it.  Okay.  Go to...  Where are we going?  Spike.com.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's where his new show is going to be.  Sure.  Okay.  Spike.com.  We started with Criss Angel.  We might as well end this break with Criss Angel.  Believe. 
[01:07:30]  No.  There's nothing to believe because his presentation sucks.  Believe.  Criss Angel.  Is this the Shaq?  This.  This is the Shaq.  All right.  Let's watch the Shaq.  They're levitated by the great Criss Angel.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  How you guys doing?  Oh, there's Shaq.  I can't see it, Sam.  I want to see the trick.  But an opportunity to levitate somebody over seven feet tall, probably 370 pounds. 
[01:08:00]  If I could lift him up...  We'll play a game.  Pause.  That would be amazing.  I mean, for the world...  Now, look.  Yeah.  He's into illusions.  That's fine.  Sure.  But let's point out where he fucking goes horribly wrong with his presentation.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Magic.  But if I could do anything greater than that, that would be something to see.  I've known Shaq for some time, and he loves magic.  Chris!  It's working!  He would go to the press.  He's a good actor.  I want Chris Angel to make me float.  I challenged Chris Angel to make me float. 
[01:08:30]  Challenge?  And he kept on taunting me about it.  And so when I had this opportunity, I said...  Yeah, because he's in on it, Chris.  Call him out and see if he'll come to Vegas.  Of course he will.  Will he allow me to attempt to make him the biggest guy that would ever be levitated in the history of my art?  His personality.  He's like a kid.  Shut up.  To try to control his personality, to levitate him?  That's a whole nother set of circumstances that need to be dealt with.  This cowlick is enraging.  And see if this is something that we can really bring to life.  Shaq, relax. 
[01:09:00]  Relax.  Levitate Shaq.  Oh, it's Norma T.  That's the next thing.  That's right.  Chris Angel to leave.  Tuesdays at 10, starting October 15th.  Oh, it's...  Today?  Tonight.  All right.  I gotta see it.  We just plugged this dumb show.  Look at us.  He wanted to promote it on our show.  Oh.  Oh, well.  It's good.  You know what?  I think a lot of people are going to be checking out Chris Angel tonight.  Hell yeah.  That's right. 
[01:09:30]  Mind Freak.  Tony Orlando's daughter will.  Mind Freak.  Yeah.  Be checking that out.  Oh.  Does he do the Mind Freak thing anymore?  Or has he moved on?  It's Believed.  It's Believed.  It's Believed now.  Yeah.  But Mind Freak means, all right, I'm fucking with your brain.  Right.  But now he's like, fuck that.  My superpowers are so goddamn good now.  Now you just gotta believe.  Believe.  But look.  Look how it's spelled.  Look what's capitalized in Believed.  Lie.  Asshole.  Lie.  L-I-E.  What is that? 
[01:10:00]  Whoa.  I don't know.  Maybe from he's the expressway.  Maybe because he's from Long Island.  Or maybe it's B-E.  He's trying to highlight B-E.  He's got transsexual tendencies.  By the way, because I went on a stupid tangent, the guy from PA.  Yeah.  So he had to go to work, I guess, but he was called into HR.  Puffin's.  See, this has gone way past the school shit that happens in the workplace. 
[01:10:30]  The guy brought in, I don't know why, but he brought in peanut butter cookies for everybody.  Oh, man.  And a chick on the job with him went to HR.  Because he brought in peanut butter cookies.  Oh, my God.  I would love to hear that story.  Bring a German shepherd with him also.  That old gag.  I would love to hear that story if the guy is still out there.  Aren't we all adults?  Can't you just say no, thank you? 
[01:11:00]  My throat will close.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks, I'll die.  You can't be that much of a dust thing because you go to restaurants, and in restaurants,  they have to have certain things with peanuts in them.  So don't act like it's only about peanut dust.  Just have EpiPens laying around the classroom so everyone else can enjoy a good peanut butter cookie.  How long until we read about a company banning peanut butter from their house?  I'm sure it's already happened.  I'm certain of it.  Or you make the employee sign something saying,  if I fucking grab my throat and fall face first on the floor, I won't sue you for not banning peanut butter. 
[01:11:30]  That's all.  They know that I'm going to sue.  It's going to end up being a legal thing.  Well, yeah, because people sue.  That's why companies do this, because fucking greedy people in the public keep suing.  Sue everyone.  Wait till HR in this company finds out there are Uncrustables in the vending machine.  God, I love Uncrustables.  What's an Uncrustable?  It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with no crust.  No, but it has crust.  Tucked into the...  Because they pinched the side, so that's now the crust.  Yeah, but it's not crust.  It's crust.  It doesn't taste crusty.  Anything that doesn't have the goodness in between it is crust to me. 
[01:12:00]  You don't like crust?  You don't like that word?  Sounds sick.  Can I eat your crust?  Oh, God.  Crust.  Pizza crust.  I love pizza crust.  I do like a good piece of pizza crust.  It's crusty.  Foreskin crust does not sound good.  No, it doesn't.  It's crusty.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Is Iraq getting all excited?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I had Iraq's money.  Fuck.  What?  How much?  I'm not saying how much.  Oh, man.  We didn't get the amount.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, I'll pay you, Iraq.  Uh-oh.  I forgot it.  Tomorrow's.  We never got the full amount at the end of that bit.  Can I jot him down a check?  Yep.  Can I give him some cash?  Cash?  Cash or check? 
[01:13:00]  I guess cash.  If it's cash, it's probably not as much as he was hoping it was.  Fuck him.  Oh, man.  Did he negotiate it down a little bit?  No, I did.  Did you knock some shit off?  Oh, yeah.  I just said, this is what it's going to be.  Oh, man.  But it's impressive.  Because he wanted a lot.  It's impressive.  He wanted the whole shebang.  What is it?  What percent did you say?  50%?  Did you 50% him?  No.  No less?  What was the total, Erick?  What were you looking for? 
[01:13:30]  Do you want the actual total?  Yeah.  You just asked for it on the radio.  Really, Jim?  Give me the actual total of what I owe you.  All right.  The actual total was...  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:00]  By the way, today's William Shatner Day.  William's been doing our show for a long time now.  I am.  He's always got something going on.  Always.  God, he's fucking productive, man.  What is he promoting?  Hardest working man in the show business.  It's Ponder the Mystery, a new CD.  What is this?  Like spoken word stuff again?  I don't know.  What is it?  It's an album. 
[01:14:30]  It's an album.  It's an album.  Oh, he's on it.  It's a...  Oh, it's a prog rock concept album.  What?  I wasn't a big fan of the prog rock.  You didn't like prog rock?  Who are some of your big prog rock artists?  Yes.  Yes was a biggie, right?  Yes is...  What's prog rock?  Yes is involved with that, I think, yeah.  Actually, one of the Yes dudes is the producer on this.  Ah.  Billy Sherwood.  Oh.  The album features artists such as Rick Wakeman, George Duke, Robbie Krieger. 
[01:15:00]  Robbie Krieger.  Edgar Winter.  That's a good one.  Out.  Yeah, yeah.  Steve Vai.  Were you a big Steve Vai fan?  Not really.  What, he knew how to work his way around a fucking guitar, man.  He certainly could.  People are coming up with King Crimson.  King Crimson.  King Crimson.  That's what he...  Alan Parsons.  Alan Parsons, really?  Alan Parsons Project.  What is...  What's considered progressive rock? 
[01:15:30]  Progressive rock.  It gets all, like, spacey and shit.  Very trippy music.  They don't pay attention to time in general.  Oh, okay.  If it takes them 18 minutes to, you know, get their point across.  Right.  So be it.  Yeah.  So be it.  So be it.  Yeah, so be it.  Would Pink Floyd be in that category and a little prog rock?  I don't know.  They're a little, um...  Weren't they above prog rock?  Yeah.  Thick as a brick.  Jethro Tull, prog rock?  Really? 
[01:16:00]  Hmm.  That doesn't make sense.  Well, the original version of one of their big hits was actually very long,  and I can't remember the fucking song.  Rush isn't prog rock?  No.  Look down for the Jethro Tull song.  There's a song we all know.  We've heard a million fucking times on the radio,  but the actual album version is, like, 12 minutes long.  Thick as a brick?  Is it thick as a brick?  I don't know.  Is that what they're saying?  No.  They're saying, um...  Do you ever hear Aqualung? 
[01:16:30]  Fuck yeah.  We'll have to do that one, Jimmy, on the streets of New York.  Sitting on a park bench.  They're not coming up with anything.  Thick as a brick is 22 and a half minutes.  There you go.  That's the one that we've heard a million fucking times,  but the actual version is 22 minutes?  Off the album?  That's what it's saying in here.  Part one is 22 and a half. 
[01:17:00]  Part two is 2057.  Come on.  There's no reason for that.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  What do you want?  My words but a whisper is deafness a shout.  I may make you feel, but I can't make you think.  What do you want?  Yeah.  You spend in the concert. 
[01:17:30]  Your love's in the sink.  So you ride a sail over the fields.  And you make all your animals feel.  And your white men don't know how it feels.  I'm sick as a brick.  See, this is still the rock radio version. 
[01:18:00]  I want to hear when it starts getting all fucking trippy.  You still have 21 minutes and 20 seconds.  Oh, great.  A little shout-out to Robert DeStasi, who was a huge Jethro Tull fan.  I haven't forgotten about your brother.  But we would go to his house, and we weren't throwing rocks at the neighbor, who was a witch.  We were convinced she was a witch, so we would throw rocks at her. 
[01:18:30]  She would get so mad.  We'd go inside, and he would try to turn me on to Jethro Tull.  And you know what?  I like Jethro Tull.  He went really deep.  He was very obsessed with Jethro Tull.  Really?  Really obsessed.  He had everything, man.  How does he stretch this song to 20 minutes?  We're going to find out.  We're not going to play the whole thing, but we'll hear the change.  It's coming.  Sounds very Ren Faire. 
[01:19:00]  This is still the album version.  Yeah.  A wandering minstrel.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  Little bells.  It's weird, but it's kind of enjoying.  Oh, now it's just going to do this. 
[01:19:30]  I bet there's a lute in there.  Sting on his lute.  I think I just made a huge mistake.  What happened?  Feeling really uncomfortable.  Oh, no.  I need a confessional.  Oh, no.  What happened?  You know the Robert De Stassi story?  Yeah.  Throwing rocks at the neighbor?  Yeah.  And we'd go inside and listen to the Jethro Tull records?  Yeah.  It was actually Craig Bench, and we would throw rocks at Robert De Stassi's mother.  Because we saw this. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  His mother was the witch?  I just made a huge error.  There was a time we thought, oh, my God, I'm eating up.  They were neighbors or were very close to each other.  Uh-huh.  And Craig Bench, who I, he had, I shouldn't say this.  I'm not going to say what I was about to say.  He was a bad boy.  He was a bad boy.  Unless it's murder, I'm sure the statute of limitations is up.  Craig Bench was a bad boy.  And I knew the error in my ways, and I had to say goodbye to Craig Bench, even though I liked him. 
[01:20:30]  But he was into some shit, even, I knew at 12 years old he was into some shit.  Uh-oh, like Tree Fort Richard and Joey Butlicker?  Well, we would go to the, you know, above Washington Drive School?  Uh-huh.  Probably not.  But there were neighborhoods in there that they were building at the time.  Yeah.  And we did the famous thing that every kid would do.  You go in and out of the developments while they're being built, which was cool.  You'd get to just wander through these houses.  We would steal wood for tree forts.  Well, Craig Bench would break everything. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  I mean, everything.  So it went from, wow, this is kind of fun, to what the fuck are you doing?  Oh.  And we've been chased a few times.  So I remember we'd be in his backyard, and we thought Robert DeStasi's mom was the witch,  and we'd throw rocks at her while she would rake the leaves.  But then I blew off the Craig Bench, because he scared me a bit.  And then I became friends with Robert DeStasi.  I fucked that whole thing up.  Did you tell him that you used to throw rocks at his mother?  No, he just found out.  Oh, damn.  He just found out many years later. 
[01:21:30]  Whoops.  Yeah, not good.  I would just go over there and play basketball, and we'd go inside and listen to Jethro Tull records.  That's all.  That's a bit of a faux pas.  Yeah, I fucked up.  I had to confess that one.  Here it is.  This is where it's getting tricky.  By the way, I think we're getting a little crazy.  So far, I'm enjoying it.  Oh, I like it.  Okay, now I'm not.  What's this?  It sounds like fucking the background music in Clockwork Orange when he was watching the movies. 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  Oh, where's it going now?  Wow, I stopped liking it.  Wouldn't this be a new song?  It's not.  This isn't Thick as a Brick anymore.  This is a new song.  What are you doing?  I would love to know the story behind this song where someone said, look, no, we're going  to do the beginning and the end, and you've got a hit song here, because it was a hit.  It's like a Spinal Tap fucking song.  What year is this like?  The Pipes of Patton.  This is the early 70s, right?  Are they still together or no? 
[01:22:30]  They might have even started in the late 60s, maybe.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I think Tony Naomi played with them.  I don't know how much Jethro Tull knowledge, but definitely...  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He left Sabbath to play with them.  67 they started?  Is that true?  Wow.  Jethro Tull.  Meh.  Want to do Jethro Tull Day?  Just let this play the whole fucking time.  Come back, it'll still be going.  Just go grab a bite, you'll still be hearing that one. 
[01:23:00]  This isn't Thick as a Brick anymore.  And he's standing up there playing his dumb flute.  Oh.  Casting shadows on the wall.  Ah, that's...  The sun plays on the infinite.  How easy to write, this song.  You're just like...  You just gotta write about oldie stuff.  I like it.  I like this fuck.  Nick in Ohio says this record is one continued song. 
[01:23:30]  It tells a story.  Of course it does.  It's Game of Thrones.  The hand gets cut off.  The cock gets cut off.  The dragons fly and bite you.  See, it's easy.  It reminds me of when I played EverQuest. 
[01:24:00]  It sounds very EverQuesty.  Are you leveling up?  I haven't leveled up in years.  Wait, is this the radio version or no?  Uh-uh.  Oh, you haven't heard this part?  No, man.  The radio version is really short.  I think it's a little over three minutes.  That's it.  It's quick.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Someone in this organization or the record labels understood the brilliance of this song  and said, no, look, man.  I know you're doing a fucking story song here.  Yeah.  But you got three and a half minutes of fucking pure gold that we're going to throw on the radio. 
[01:24:30]  You need a hit, you fucker.  Right.  You're not going to get it with this.  If you have the hit, then you can play the flute all you want.  Do you understand, sir?  Do you think there were some groovy FM stations, though?  We're going to track through the entire album.  Of course.  So tune in this morning.  This Sunday.  Yes, as we track through the entire Jethro Tull fucking long as shit album.  Sunday mornings.  Sunday mornings was the place for all that shit.  Do you remember your favorite rock station, wherever the fuck it would be, and you're 
[01:25:00]  coming home all hungover or whatever the fuck.  You're up early on a Sunday and you have no business being up, but you're like, all right,  I'm going to turn on my fucking rock station.  Yeah.  And they always had this horse shit on.  Some type of fucking prog rock shit.  Because they were burying it.  Because they were burying it.  Because they were burying it.  They always were burying it.  And you just wanted to hear hits.  Some rock stations on Sunday morning would do the acoustic versions of songs that they play  in their rotation.  Sunday mornings.  I don't mind a good acoustic song.  Yeah, me neither, man. 
[01:25:30]  I like it.  Listen to this now.  Just a guitar flute solo.  Right now, Ratso Rizzo is stealing bologna in his pocket in the party.  All right.  And this just goes on and on.  How much time is left?  13.45.  We're not even halfway.  No way.  It's not even halfway.  And this is only part one, right?  Part one.  This is part one.  Ha ha.  Come on.  Nah, nah, nah.  Drumms are good.  Nice.  You could just put this on at a party, man.  We could ride this to Shatner. 
[01:26:00]  Ha ha ha.  We could.  Oh, boy.  Would they be mad.  Yeah.  What do you want to do with this?  You want to go to the end to see how part one ends, at least?  Do they go back to that thick as a brick stuff?  Yeah, I'm sure they go back to thick as a brick.  Go to the end.  The last, like, minute.  Oh, wait.  Stonehenge, where the demons dwell, where the banshees live, and they do live well.  Stonehenge.  Spinal task is old.  Same shit. 
[01:26:30]  Stonehenge was a complete goof on fucking Jethro Tull.  All those bands, sure.  Yeah, they, like, every, there were a few songs that absolutely were goofs on bands, and  I like, uh, I like Jethro Tull a lot.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's this guy.  Oh, boy.  I have a peeler allergy.  Bob in Connecticut.  Bob, we're going to move on from Jethro Tull, but I hear you got something.  I got Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Thick as a Brick, um, some other 
[01:27:00]  concept albums.  Those are the things you listen to where you were tripping in college.  You got to be tripping.  Tripping face.  I had no idea that this was one of those trippy records.  No clue.  I didn't either.  It's a good one.  It's 45 minutes straight.  You got the CD.  You don't even got to flip the album over.  I remember I went to the neighbor's house once, uh, the, the Omens.  That was that last name.  Did you throw rocks at the, the witch?  No, I didn't throw rocks at the witch.  Did the maid hang herself off the balcony?  Yes, I was hanging out with little Damien.  Yeah, uh, the Omens lived next door, and they were, uh, the kind of a spirit. 
[01:27:30]  The actual Omens?  Yes.  The last name was Omens.  When the movie was out?  Omens.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Last name was Omens.  Jesus.  And, uh, they put on, uh, the Beatles, uh, the White Album.  Right.  And we used to go into this room that was, like, kind of the attic room, and smoke marijuana.  And, uh, it was kind of creepy.  You were ahead of your time.  Was that first fucking feeling of getting buzzed?  No, it was about 17 at the time.  Number nine.  Yeah, and then you'd go, number nine, number nine. 
[01:28:00]  With all those sounds and backwards shit.  You sound naked.  That was crazy.  Yeah.  And then, of course, I'd get all paranoid and have to fucking run into my bed within the  fetal position.  Aw.  It was like, I thought I was in a submarine.  When I watched Grey Lady Down.  Oh, you poor kid.  So scary.  Thanks, Bob.  He did?  Yeah.  Why'd you think you were in a submarine?  Well, I was watching, um, I was watching, uh, that movie with, uh, Charlton Heston, um,  and, uh, David Carradine, Grey Lady Down. 
[01:28:30]  And it was about a submarine.  Yeah.  And the submarine kind of sunk to the bottom and they had to rescue the people.  So I was smoking weed and I watched it and I got so into it because I was high that I  started feeling like claustrophobic and everything.  Oh.  I started imagining what it would be like if, oh my God, they're in a submarine, they're  at the bottom of the ocean, they got, ah, and I had to just, I had to go to bed.  I had to just go into my bed and curl up and be like, okay, it's okay.  I had to talk myself down.  You want more info on, uh, Ian Anderson? 
[01:29:00]  How much time we got left?  Ian Anderson.  Ten and a half.  God, can we do this?  I mean, we're talking over, which is cool, right?  Sure.  Let's say hi to Art.  Art.  Hey, guys, uh, Ian Anderson is a multi-millionaire because he's a salmon and trout farmer too.  He made most of his money, actually more money, doing trout and salmon farming in Scotland.  Is this a fun fact?  It is a fun fact.  I think it's a fun fact.  Mine is the fun part.  Yes, no fun.  Why would he decide to, like, raise salmon? 
[01:29:30]  I like how that sound is a question and then the do-do-do-do is like a game show.  The music's like do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Write your answer down.  Let's say why.  No, Art left us.  He leaves us with that shitty fact and then leaves us hanging.  Yeah.  All right.  Nine and a half.  No, we're not going to make it, E-Rock.  I'll destroy this.  We're running out of, uh, Ian Anderson.  Do you want me to jump to the, uh, end? 
[01:30:00]  The last couple minutes?  No, no, no.  Last, like, 30 seconds.  30 seconds?  Sorry, I want to, like when Nigel Tufnell from Spinal Tap played his guitar with a violin.  He picked up a violin and just started playing his guitar with the violin.  What a great movie.  It was so ridiculous.  They should, they could have easily made a second movie.  Uh, yeah, it wasn't.  They easily could have, though.  There was so much more to goof on.  Yeah, I don't know.  That first one's solid.  It's amazing.  It's so good.  We're playing the, uh, E-Normo Dome. 
[01:30:30]  I don't even know.  All right, here we go.  All right.  You want more, uh, Ian Anderson fun facts?  Uh, are there any more?  Yes, there's a good one coming in.  Oh. 
[01:31:00]  Uh, Paul in D.C.  Good morning, gentlemen.  What's up, Paul?  The lead, the lead actor from Walking Dead.  I can't think of his name, but he's married.  Andrew Lincoln.  Yeah, he's married to his daughter.  Married to Ian Anderson's daughter.  Well, let's, let's look at, uh, what she looks like.  How about that?  Let's take a look at Ian Anderson's daughter.  Fun fact.  It's a great fun fact.  All right, how long is he going to do this?  Dang, dang, dang.  I got another fun fact.  The Echoplex.  I got another fun fact coming in.  Yeah.  As we look up Ian Anderson's daughter, there's no way this is true, but I'll go with it. 
[01:31:30]  Jeff on Long Island.  Jeff.  Jeffy.  Fun fact.  Yeah, I hear that.  I've heard that, uh, his drummer went through a sex change operation.  Come on.  Oh, no.  No way.  Come on.  Are you fucking with us?  No.  All right, I'm going to look it up.  Thank you, sir.  Is that, uh, Rick's wife?  Mm-hmm.  I don't see.  All right.  A little frumpy.  What are you going to do?  Uh, let's look at the drummer.  You're very English. 
[01:32:00]  Jethro Tull's drummer.  Sex change.  I got to know if this is true.  Come on.  How can you play the drums with those boobs in the way?  Right?  The tits.  The big titties.  Uh, anything?  D.  D. Palmer.  All right.  Okay.  Gender transition in 2003.  Jeth Palmer.  And he did it late in life.  He came out as a transsexual and intersex.  This is something we've talked about so many times.  If you have those feelings inside, do it when you're young so you can enjoy your fucking 
[01:32:30]  young female body.  That wasn't looked at well probably in the 60s, though.  They probably couldn't do much with it.  These guys that want to, like, turn into old ladies, I don't understand that.  What?  What do you do when you're young?  Well, yeah.  Once you reach a certain age, it's over, Johnny.  Is there pictures, Sam?  Sure.  Well, I always felt I was a woman living in a man's body, so I decided it was time to  bring out my feminine side. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God!  Ah, ha!  Look at the pictures!  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, no, this poor bastard is very confused.  She's delightful.  Wow.  Look, we're supposed to...  I mean, I guess I understand, but I don't know.  But we're not allowed to laugh at that?  Uh.  Oh.  Why would you turn yourself into an old lady?  Oh.  Cos I'm sick of my prick.  Dun-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  No?  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:33:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha!  Do they allow him to continue with the band?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I saw an end date for Jethro Tull, 2012.  So what, did they finally retire in 2012?  That was it?  I don't know.  I saw it on their page.  Is he still in the band, or she, or...  That would be really odd.  Like, oh, and here's our fucking drummer.  And they all flirt with her and pinch her ass. 
[01:34:00]  Come on, Cookie.  You think she now demands her own locker room and all that?  Locker room.  Fucking dressing room.  I'm a lady.  I can't be hanging out with the guys all naked.  That is a man.  You don't think she's attractive?  No.  God, that's terrible.  On the Opie Nancy show, we have tolerance, but we also have a sense of humor that needs to get out. 
[01:34:30]  She looks ridiculous.  Totally ridiculous.  You want another fun fact about Ian Anderson?  All right.  Of course, Jethro Tull.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, Ian Anderson is un-American.  He once said that Americans are fat, lazy, stupid, and arrogant.  All right.  All right.  Well, fair enough.  Where's the problem?  Point taken.  I think he described this perfectly.  Thanks, Greg. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, Greg.  Is this still thick as a brick?  Part two?  Part two?  No, this is still part one.  I kept this going when I jumped to the end.  I thought this.  But there's four and a half left on the original.  Holy shit.  I'm trying to buy this, but my fucking cunt iTunes isn't opening.  Oh, no.  On the phone.  I want to get this.  I'm missing out on some.  You want to check this out, Jimmy?  Yeah, but I just can't.  My iTunes on the phone stinks.  Damn.  You want me to start off part two?  No.  Why don't you let part one finish?  What a fucking pecker licker. 
[01:35:30]  This is not thick as a brick.  But it's cool.  I don't mind it.  It's a bunch of different songs without that fucking thing that separates the songs.  Ah.  All right.  I think I've had it with Jethro Tull.  He's a nice voice, though.  Quite frankly.  Yeah, it's very Ian Anderson-ish. 
[01:36:00]  The drummer's sex change.  Who knew?  That's really odd.  Man.  That really is odd.  It's rough.  All right.  Not bad.  Nah.  If we're going to talk about music, though, I would like to bring up the new song.  Oh, we're going to take a little break.  We should, right?  Yeah.  Is that what you're talking about?  Yeah.  I got to hear that.  I got to actually see the video and hear it.  We absolutely got a nice little song for everybody after the break.  New song. 
[01:36:30]  We also have William Shatner.  Oh, yeah.  Bill Shatner.  And I think we might be able to squeeze in a little Jocktober today.  Yes, we need to do that.  Got anything special today, Sam Roberts?  Yes, I do.  Don't give me a read, because I'm going to fucking hit the can.  I wanted to make up.  We had no Jocktober yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  So I wanted to make sure today's counted.  Yeah, it has to.  Is it a strong one?  I think so.  What city are we going to?  Oh, we don't want to say.  Don't want to say.  No.  What country?  We don't want them to be on to us.  Is it Canada? 
[01:37:00]  Local?  Sort of local to us?  Mexico?  Local-ish.  East Coast-ish?  East Coast-ish, I would say.  Yes.  All right, that's good enough.  Same time zone.  That's all you need.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:30]  William Shatner is going to be on the show in about an hour.  Nice.  Also going to squeeze in some Jocktober before then.  Sure.  But right now, Anthony is on to a new song.  I haven't heard this one yet.  I haven't heard it either.  Oh, you haven't?  No, there's a video, though.  Going cold.  I want to see the video and hear the song, because this is from the same gentleman that  brought you Friday.  Now you, of course, remember this song.  Partyin', partyin'. 
[01:38:00]  Nice.  Yeah, partyin'.  Is she still happening?  No, she hasn't been happening for quite some time.  She might want to do some of that twerking, right?  Maybe.  And it's also the same person that brought you, you might remember, about a year ago.  Same person, now Rebecca Black.  No, no, this black guy that gets these together.  The producer.  The producer guy.  The producer, right.  Uh, Thanksgiving.  Remember Thanksgiving?  We have that one.  From, um, the Thanksgiving.  And the turkey. 
[01:38:30]  Mashed potatoes.  You don't like sleeves, but you like the Thanksgiving song?  Well, I didn't say I liked it.  Oh.  This guy.  This guy produces these.  He gets these rich white kids.  To make these music videos.  Fourteen and a half million views on the video.  Are you kidding?  Fourteen and a half million.  Yeah! 
[01:39:00]  Remember this?  New year.  New year.  And.  New year.  New year.  New year.  New year.  New year.  It's amazing what happens.  It's Thanksgiving.  We, we.  Remember this?  It's kind of catchy.  The turkey. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Thanksgiving.  Would you ever let your kid work with this producer?  No.  Like, these kids, they're so fame-hungry.  Yes.  They know that it's going to be only negative attention.  Like, we know this.  It's already been set up.  Why would you do this?  What do you mean?  How many likes does the video have?  It's got 35,000 likes.  Okay, there you go.  So where's the hate?  Is there a follow-up question to that? 
[01:40:00]  How many dislikes?  Just for argument's sake?  All right, fair enough.  Just to prove my point.  It's got 555,000 dislikes.  Wow.  Yeah.  How many views?  14.5 million.  Wow.  Fuck, man.  Friday is almost at 59 million.  Wow.  Whoa.  That's almost twice as much as my Patty video.  Holy shit.  What?  My almost 7 million view Patty video.  Wow.  7 million?  Almost.  Are you serious?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Wow.  And Facebook, though, not YouTube.  Oh.  It's all about YouTube.  It's all about YouTube.  It's a lot of people.  So now, I guess this producer, this creepy black guy producer, got a hold of, what's  her name?  Allison Gold?  Allison Gold.  Allison Gold.  Is it another cute kid?  I don't know.  I have not seen any hide nor hair of this.  It is.  Oh, yeah.  The formula.  The formula, though.  To a T.  That's the formula.  The young girl, the video, white girl, and singing about some inane fucking shit. 
[01:41:00]  This song is called Chinese Food.  Wait till you hear this.  And I have not heard.  I'm so glad you guys haven't heard it yet.  See, I'm very psyched.  Let's go full screen and let's dive right into Chinese food.  It's great.  She does not go clubbing. 
[01:41:30]  You're 12.  She's not going clubbing.  What are you talking about?  She's fucking 12.  Maybe 13.  She's not going clubbing.  I get a hug that I'm hungry and I'm walking around the street and I'm getting, getting,  getting, getting grumpy, grumpy. 
[01:42:00]  Uh-oh.  She's vandalizing.  I'm all right.  That's my food.  Oh, no.  What kind of food do you think it is?  It's Chinese food.  I'm my favorite.  So I'm getting, getting, getting, getting hungry.  I love Chinese food.  I love Chinese food.  Yeah.  It's the same formula.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  But she made it rain with chow mein.  Oh, she did.  Yeah.  Poor sweatshop worker behind the register.  She doesn't enjoy it as much as the girl singing about it.  They got broccoli  Even chicken wings  Make it spicy  And you'll like it  What?  Because it's beautiful  And it tastes so so good 
[01:43:00]  I like the egg rolls  The turkey, the mashed potatoes  Thanksgiving  Oh, it says you will find a new friend  Oh, it's a panda  She's now skipping through the field with a panda  With her tiny little buds  Her nubbins  These videos are creepy 
[01:43:30]  Yes, I know it's true  She's pointing out the Chinese food in the sky  Oh, the black guy has to make a little cameo  He was in the panda suit  The whole time  Now he's eating broccoli and playing Monopoly  People are paying to have him put himself in the air 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  Ew  Oh, now they're all dressed like Chinese people  Starting to  They're like kabuki makeup  Boarded on racism  It is  This is touchy  A little touchy, huh?  Could be racist  Chinese food 
[01:44:30]  Kids doing a math problem in the background  You see that?  Yeah  I see  Look at that  It's all that shit  Another one's driving poorly  Right  Just crashing to the front of the Chinese restaurant  Man, man, man  Man, man, man  Whoa, the panda bird just disappeared into a rainbow  Shot up through the room  Shit  Because it was a dream the whole fucking time  The panda will fly away on a rainbow  It's very literal  Really?  That wasn't even like  How many views?  It's up to  Last night

That's very good  It's not  Good question  It's no different  Let's do this over here  It's Jocktober  Jocktober  A celebration of all things shitty in radio  That's not very nice  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions 
[01:46:30]  That's so bad  Wow  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid  Jocktober  O-S-G  Hosts  Holes  Bits  And stunt boys  This isn't funny  It's time for  Jocktober  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I saw the space movie  I want to see the boat movie 
[01:47:00]  Oh, you did?  Yes, I did  So when were you going to talk about it?  Eh  You didn't like it?  Eh  Ah, you  Come on  I thought the effects were amazing  What?  I saw it in IMAX 3D too  Yeah  What was the problem?  It looks great  I even said  It's like being on a fucking ride  It's great  Amazing  Amazing  You're fucking in it  You're in it  You're floating around  Other than that  First of all  Fucking  Sandra Bullock  Is  She stinks 
[01:47:30]  She's fucking  She's exactly the same  Whiny girl  That she is on the bus  And fucking  On the net  And every other fucking movie  She was in  She's the same fucking thing  There's nothing amazing about it  The story itself  Was just like  I found myself  Getting a little bored  She's stuck in space  Bored  It's non-stop action  I know  That's the good part  Going from  You know  Fucking  Space station  To space station  I did like  The scenery  Did you believe  George Clooney  As an astronaut  Or were you thinking 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit  It's George Clooney in space  I was a little out of it  With George Clooney in space  But yeah  Visually  I don't know how they did it  It's the most cutting edge  Fucking  Cinematography  I've ever seen  In space  It's great  But  Did you like to get to know  You're part of the movie  When they finally decide  To ask questions  About like  Where they  They're from  Stuff that they would have known  Yeah  That's the one thing  That did bother me  Not enough to say  The movie sucked  I didn't say it sucked  It was  It looked great  I thought she was really great 
[01:48:30]  I didn't think she was really great  I thought she was Sandra Bullock  Like she is in  It was  Like speed in space  I'm not a fan of Sandra Bullock  But I liked her in this one  No I didn't  I don't want to give it away  But there was that one thing  That I thought  Yeah yeah yeah  That annoyed me  And when I realized  They weren't doing it  I was like  That was a tremendous  That really  Yeah yeah yeah  Took me off guard  I was like  Fucking very impressed  That they did something  Like I thought  That was pretty brilliant  Yeah they were  You know  I just didn't find  Like I thought  I was going to go in 
[01:49:00]  And go like  Holy fuck  That was the greatest movie  I tell you the truth  I liked the boat movie better  Wow  Even though they said  That was a total  Croc of shit  Yeah yeah yeah  I could give a shit  You know  I'm there to watch a movie  Sure  And I liked the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I can't believe  You got bored during Gravity  It's 90 minutes  And it's like  About a person  That has to  Dude there's only like  Two minutes of downtime  I know  They made it  Isolated on purpose  I think 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  Like 2001  There's two minutes  Where they're working a wrench  Besides that  It's like  It's like  Non-stop action  No I know  As far as  I mean  Story wise  I got bored  It was kind of like  You know  Alright  Do you like when  George Clooney  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah  It was some good stuff  Like I said  It looked great  It was kind of creepy  When she drops the wrench  You're like  Holy shit  Is she going to get the wrench back  Oh my god  Yeah there was certainly  It's very tense  The floating  The movement in space  That they  I thought they painted so well 
[01:50:00]  It was great  Yeah  It was fucking impressive  Did you like the opening shot  Yeah that was very cool  How they really took their time  And  Fucking amazing  Just showing you how vast  It really is up there  And there's Martians dancing  I was like wow  Yeah  It looked great  It looked great  I like Sandra Bullock  And I typically don't love her  I think she's  In this one though  I just thought  Maybe I cried a little  Oh god  Maybe I did  Did you really  Maybe I did a little  What part  I don't know  I don't know  Maybe there's a couple parts 
[01:50:30]  Sometimes I'm emotional  You are emotional  Oh  Oh Jimmy  Alright  Alright  Jock told me  I like Jock  So what would you give it  Let's do the ABC thing  Out of five stars  And you can do the minuses  And the pluses  No I gotta do stars  Out of five stars  I got a lot of places  Do the fucking ABCs  I don't like the ABCs  Me neither  How many stars would it  I'm a one through five stars  Alright one through five  Do you do half stars  I do do half stars  Sure  Let's go

[02:07:30]  Oh you have a peanut allergy  Why am I entertaining Craig Schinkel  I don't know  I like Nickelback very much  I feel very good  What's the big Nickelback song  Photograph  Photographs very big  Yeah  How's that go again  Look at this photograph  Every time I do it  I don't know  I don't know why  They get so much shit  It's a good sound  It's a good song  Why do they get so much shit  Me and Than once went through this song  Lyric by Lyric 
[02:08:00]  Just to demolish  Jerking each other off  Jerking  In the car  No  Well where does all the shit come from  It's just  People love hating on Nickelback  They sold a lot of records  It's one of those easy bands  Same reason people love to hate on  You know like  Ryan Seacrest  But he still makes a lot of money  Because it's very digestible  But  What  This was their biggest hit  Is he now with STP  Someone is saying  No  Oh that's the dude from Lincoln Park  Oh this one was huge 
[02:08:30]  I love this song  This was huge  I like this song  Call me an asshole  Open the door  Look at her and Maxim  Look at Avril and Maxim  Wow  She's cute right there  She's fantastic  Yo Chad we like this one  Listen  No one likes this 
[02:09:00]  Everyone hates this  Let me tell you something  I like this song  It's so easy to go  I know  I think if you're like  It's catchy  Drive and it comes on  You probably won't turn it off  Listen  Yeah  The only people that like this song  Are the people that have Chad Kroger  In the room with them  Or just have Chad Kroger  In the room with them  Is that  Yeah  No no  I think what happened with Nickelback  Tiger Woods likes Nickelback  Oh yeah  That personality  Yeah  Tiger Woods like hangs out backstage  At Nickelback shows 
[02:09:30]  And I think that fucked it up  For a lot of people  Because Tiger Woods is a fucking nerd  And he's not cool  He's not cool whatsoever  Although the banging the chicks thing  Helped his credibility  But  This is how you remind me  What I really am  This is how you remind me  Of what I really am  It's not like you  Same story  We're waiting on a different story  You're gonna like  This is not bad  Why do you not mind this? 
[02:10:00]  You're gonna have to do this  From live at the compound  This song doesn't suck  How old is it?  I like this song  It's like  3000 fucking 1-2  Yeah  This is an old song  Let's get back to Jacktober  Yeah  This was before everybody  Really hated Nickelback  Have they sold a lot of records?  Yeah  Right  This was like  Yeah  They sold a lot of records  They played at the Olympics  A lot of money  Believe me  He's like  Looking at Avril Lavigne money  Probably going  Alright sweetie  You can put yours in with mine 
[02:10:30]  Avril Lavigne's is like a hobby  Right  Like oh you sing  That's cute  You got a little side business  What's their song sound like?  I don't have the duet  Yeah  Why?  We have the Avril Lavigne single  But it's not the duet right now  What's your single for Pete's sake?  Well have them sing it  Get them back in here and say  Hey sing your fucking song  Exactly  While we all fucking point  I married Avril Lavigne  Yeah  Is this it?  This is the single  Okay  Billy Zane's in the video  We want the one with the Chad thing  Billy Zane's good though 
[02:11:00]  He was good in Titanic  Billy Zane  He's not a nice guy  I was going to a boat movie  Yeah that's right  I was going to sink and boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I refuse to play that one  I want to hear the one  With the Nickelback dude  Winnie Cooper from the Wonder Years  Is in it  What?  He's looking all smoking hot  Cool  I had a crush on her  Is it called Let Me Go?  Oh look at Avril  That's what we would say to the bosses  I don't know  Let's take a listen  Very comic book-y  Well no  If we hear the Nickelback guy  Oh yeah 
[02:11:30]  This is a ballad  Yeah  Ira Levine looks like  Mistress Carrie by the way  I always thought that  You thought that too?  Absolutely  She's cute man  Very inside  I understand  But  Mistress Carrie's always been good to us  From WAF  The only station that really rocks  In her younger days  She's still doing it up there  I'm sure  I'm sure  All that once hung on the wall  Used to mean something  But now it means nothing  The echoes are gone in the hall 
[02:12:00]  But I still remember  The pain of December  Oh  There isn't one thing that you could say  I'm sorry it's too late  I'm breaking free from these memories  Sounds like another song  Oh  Should I say that?  There's something here  I said goodbye  Set it all on the fire  What was that song at the end of Superman?  At the end of the first Spider-Man 
[02:12:30]  What was that song?  Oh the He Stinks and I Don't Like Him remix?  Oh  Uh  Hero  Hero  Yeah the Nickelback song  That is a Nickelback song  Nickelback dude  This song sounds like a Nickelback song  Dude  This sounds like Nickelback  Yeah  Nickelback dude  Play heroes  Or hero  Hero  Play hero  That's a fucking good voice though 
[02:13:00]  Come on in  It is  You know vocals  Yeah it's by Chad Kroger  He released it as a single artist  Hey that?  Solo artist  Yeah  Chad Kroger  Hero  Alright play some of that  I gotta get the comparison  Didn't he say that  Hero  Yes  Yes  I am so high  I can hear ever 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  Got all that little  Nickelback has a bit of a sound 
[02:14:00]  And it certainly does  I hold off to the wings of the eagle  This is kind of  It's the female version of Hero  But it really is very similar  Alright  Open the door again  No  Oh my god  I think they're in finally right?  Are you still out there?  Quite the little songwriting team they got going for themselves there  That's my Avril Lavigne t-shirt in that photo 
[02:14:30]  Hey  When I met you  Look at young Sam  I will say that I do enjoy their new ballad together  Do you like it?  I do yeah  You know what?  It's harmless  There's no skater boy but  They have good voices  That fucking song was awesome  I listen to that shit all the time  Sam  Were you a skater boy?  Did you want to be her skater boy?  She has fucking almost 14 million people on Twitter  She's fucking huge  That's an A-lister we just had  She's cute  She's been making  And we did nothing with it  I know  Exactly  Because it came out of nowhere 
[02:15:00]  I don't know  She's been making big pop songs for 10 years  Nobody does that  This song fucking rolls  And this is you?  Yeah  I was like  And she was Avril  I was like once I meet Avril  She's going to be like  See you later  Rest of the boys  You're just falling off your skateboard  Yeah  Just trying to ollie  Could she have a guy that played the Olympics  With a guy whose voice is too awful for entertainment radio  I can't believe she told us she's pregnant too 
[02:15:30]  That was crazy  Yeah  Great exclusive for the show  Huge  Let's get back to Jack Tolber  I can play Avril Lavigne songs all day  We're running out of time  We're going to run into William Shatner's time  It's true  Oh man  I'm off  Crazy  Today's Jack Tolber  Is WBE  Rochester's New Country  Featuring the great  I say the great Terry Clifford  Yes she is great  At least the kids in my family 
[02:16:00]  Oh my god  They're going to be so excited to hear that news  Never mind  I think it's a great thing  And I think it's a long time coming  I can't believe they didn't do this a while ago  Of course you do  If I'm a kid  That's the whole bad deal with the Happy Meal is the toy  I know  I'm not going to finish my nuggets just so I can read  You know what I mean  It's like you better eat your nuggets or you can't have the toy  You lose that leverage as a parent 
[02:16:30]  You do  Bad move McDonald's  Bad move  Here's our weekly peek at what's new to RedStream or Download  Unbelievable  What's unbelievable  It's unbelievable  Unbelievable  These things Jeremy says  Terry Clifford has never heard anything like this before  She's a delightful woman  Oh Jesus  She reminds me of my mother  I bet  She's very Rubenesque  Rubenesque  Delightful woman  I bet her calves need some lotion  Yes they do  She probably has  My mother would get like dry flaky calves and feet 
[02:17:00]  Chip of my psoriasis needs lotion  That voice  Pretty bad  Is horrendous  And then you couple just the  That  That  That fucking job of the hut  Blah blah blah blah  That she gets in there  You put that with that  That  That  That  That  That  Anthony is fucking mean  That Rochester accent  On top of  Blah blah blah blah blah  So you're saying there's audible big fat jowls  Yes  Big fat jowls 
[02:17:30]  Sounds like she's got a fish caught in her pelican neck  Blah blah blah blah  Steve Hausman though  I give credit there  Yeah  He knew it was a bullshit story  And he wanted to move on with his shit  Yes he did  And I think somewhere in there he was wishing he was still on with Brother Weez  No problem with Steve Hausman  No problem with Hausman  He wasn't going to play with that dumb story  He knew there was nothing there  No  Terry starts talking about flags hanging in the Rochester area  Jeremy gets her with a zinger  Oh I like a good zinger 
[02:18:00]  And with a picture of each of our  You know our lake and our falls and our river right next to it  They're very pretty  Just the first one that caught my eye  How would you know pretty  Oh  Gee  Yeah  It's very mean spirit  Oh  That one Weez is going to have to talk to you  About that little line  Bro did you have to call her a pig bro  Oh yeah he gave me a fucking talking to  He never gives me a talking to  They're very pretty 
[02:18:30]  Just the first one that caught my eye  Said city by the bed  And I thought what do we have this for  Be buying on sale from San Francisco or something  I know you've only lived here  I don't like this too cool for the room guy either  Everything  I know it's all about Terry Clifford  But what about that guy  Every word he says  Ah you know  It's just like  Yeah I know you like flags  He's trying way too hard to be 
[02:19:00]  I'm too cool for this shit  She's got a chipper thing going on  Something like that  She's marvelous  Uh you know  What's up Terry  What's up Terry  What's up Terry  What's this for  We buy it on sale from San Francisco or something  Um  I know you've only lived here about 30 years  But uh  Irondequoit  There's a bay there  I know Weisenheimer  But when somebody says  Whoa  A bay  She doesn't take any bunk  Yeah  But then  So anyway  Weisenheimer 
[02:19:30]  Exactly  Look out  This guy's good  Weisenheimer  Where's the zinger  What year is this  I thought Terry Clifford had the zinger there  No  Weisenheimer's good  That's a zinger right there  She called him a Weisenheimer  And he mumbled  Shut up pig  He missed that part too  You know  Hey Terry  Hey  You know  Hey Chipper  What's up  Are they on Twitter  Why would you ask  Because I don't want to  I think it's just mean spirited 
[02:20:00]  We should send out at least something nice to them  And say we're just kidding  And having a good time  Yeah  Terry can't believe how far  Jeremy has gone  With one of his insults  This time  This time  Jeremy has gone too far  Are you going to waste  All that manpower and labor  To hang them up  And take them down  In the same month  When you can use that time  To I don't know  Maybe pick up some trash  Around this  The same street  You're hanging these  Uh  Flags on  You know  We all think we can do a better job  We all do  Yeah  But I don't know  It's always sexy  I don't know 
[02:20:30]  And I shouldn't complain  Because I did enjoy them  And I do enjoy them  Alex  Alex White over here  Yeah  I'll debate that guy  If Lovely Warren won't do it  Set it up  Call Channel 8  We'll get in there  And I'll square off  Against old giant glasses  I don't  Oh  Jeremy  Oh  Oh  Jeremy  Oh  Ugh  Jeremy  God  That just sounds terrible  I know  Can you believe  Jeremy said that  He said he had big glasses  Jeremy  Oh no 
[02:21:00]  She's a nice lady  You know how much she'd hate me  If I called her retard wig  On the air  Fucking Lego person hair  Oh Jim  Oh now Jim  That's not funny  Yeah  Oh  Hey moose in a cancer wig  She would really hate that  Oh you know  We're just going to our jab  I don't like that accent  It's so unsexy  That Rochester  Oh yeah  We're just gonna  You know  Come in here  We're gonna do a good jab  Jab  Jab 
[02:21:30]  Jeremy  Jeremy  I think we're gonna say jab  Jab  All right  Well  Terry is blown away  By what Jeremy said  To his grandmother  Hurricane  The only thing left  She might have got  Knocked into the ocean  Like the Ferris wheel  I mean Shatner's ready  I thought he was  Coming at 920  How long do we have  Mr. Shatner  He beamed in a little early  Well  He was originally scheduled  For 9  And then we were told  Maybe it was gonna be  Close to 920 
[02:22:00]  We gotta bring him right in  Now he's Shatner  To 915  Where is he right now  He's on his way  All right  Let's take a quick break  We're gonna do  William Shatner  And then we're gonna do  The rest of Jocktober  So we're gonna get back  To the Jocktober  Don't you worry  And more with Avril Lavigne  And the Nickelback dude  We got Mr. Shatner 
[02:22:30]  Outside the studio  Bill Shatner  Get him in here  Immediately  Oh my god  Welcome back to the show  There you go  I'm aboard  Captain on the bridge  Captain on the bridge  How nice to see everybody  Mr. Shatner  Hello  Or Bill  Or Bill as I like to call him  Bill  My good friend  What's going on Bill  Back on the Opie and Anthony show  Wow  We were looking at  Your new album 
[02:23:00]  Yeah  I like this  Oh I hope you do  Yes  Yeah  It's out there  It's progressive rock  It's a whole new area  That I wrote the words  Billy Sherwood wrote the music  Yes  He's done a genius job  In interweaving music  And words  And then these great musicians  Who have done solo numbers  How does this get started  Like how do you find something like this  A project like this to do  Well the label says to me  Would you like to do another album  And I said yeah 
[02:23:30]  And they said what would you do  And I said  I just flashed on an impulse  I guess something creative  And I said  I'll write about a guy  Sitting on a beach  In despair  An hour before sunset  And then  The sun sets  And through the beauty  Of the night  He regains his joy of life  That one line  Was merely the way  I hooked songs together  Hmm 
[02:24:00]  Now that you know  You might recognize it  As a progression  But you wouldn't have to know that  To listen to the album  And hear the song  So it's a story  Well for me it's a story  But not necessarily  You know  The order of the songs  I placed the order of the songs  So that it made that kind of sense  That the opening number  Where's it gone  Give it back  I'm missing something  Give it back  Lurches into  A song of 
[02:24:30]  Unhappiness  And then gradually  He begins to find  And then he questions  Time  Where does time go  When time comes to an end  And they're all melodic  And it's all music  But it's progressive rock  So it's pushing  Some sort of  Musical envelope  Pushing the boundaries  And what do you think  Somebody maybe  Might be able to partake  A little weed  And listen to this  I think weed would be nice  Weed is always nice 
[02:25:00]  Maybe pop some mollies  Pop mollies  Tequila  Whatever  Name your poison  As they say  Do you indulge  Do you smoke  No  I mean  You know  No  But once you take  The opportunity  To enjoy oneself  Because you only  Come by once  Exactly  Exactly  Look how well dressed  Bill is  Bill always comes in here  Looking great  Is that why 
[02:25:30]  I thought I'd wear  The black suit  It's slimming  You've got like  A Johnny Cash thing  Yeah right  I'm doing my  Johnny Cash thing  Very nice  Yeah I'm going to  The prison  Yeah I'm going to the prison  Folsom prison  And sing a few songs  You might as well  About weed  I have a question  Did you really turn down  Richard Branson  He offered you the flight  To go up in the new craft  And you said no  Well  He said to me  This is some  Maybe even years ago 
[02:26:00]  A couple of years  He said  I've got  I'm going up  Would you like to go up  In the airplane  I said yeah  Sounds like  He said it's great  It'll cost you $250,000  Oh he wanted you to pay  Right so I said  Oh you want me to pay  That's crazy  No I said  I'll go  And you pay me  Yeah of course  That would help the business  To have Shatner on that  Of course  I never heard from him again  Good for you  Bill  I was going to say  Mr. Shatner  Our sheet says  You didn't go  Because you were scared 
[02:26:30]  Of airline travel  Yeah right  I'm taking  I'm a private pilot  I have seven hours  In a helicopter  I'm learning  To fly a helicopter  And he's afraid  To fly  I think he's watching  Too much twilight zone  I'm into paramotoring  Paramotoring  Wow  That's cool  So you strap  A 75 pound  Engine on your back  Run like hell  You have to run  You need a prevailing breeze  Because you've got to get  To about 13 miles per hour  To get  Flying speed 
[02:27:00]  And you've got a kite  That you're holding onto  And you run like hell  Usually on a beach  Because that's where  The prevailing breeze are  Sure  And you fly  About 25 miles an hour  And now you're up in the air  With a kite  That's crazy  But you actually do this?  Yeah  I've done it many times  How high do you go?  Well  You know  There have been some people  Who got caught  In an updraft  In a thunderstorm  And died of hypothermia  Hypothermia  They may have gone  As far as  As high as 30,000 feet 
[02:27:30]  Some of those  Hammerheads  Storm  Can get that  Oh yeah  They'll just blast you  Right up  I fly gliders as well  And this instructor  Took me up  One time  In a thunderstorm  And we were angled  Pointing straight down  And going up  And still going up  Come on  How scary is that?  That's scary  Aren't gliders  Pretty scary in general?  No  They seem like it  Well  You have to stick around  The landing field  You have to land  But you have 
[02:28:00]  A means of killing  The flight  By spoilers  On the top of the wing  So you can stop flying  Whenever you want  So if you come in  For a landing  And you're sort of  Like overshooting  And you can't go back  You know there isn't  An engine  You pull those  Flaps in  In effect  And you lose lift  And you lose lift  Almost right away  Wow  So the thunderstorms  How hot  Like you're going  At 100, 200 feet  And then a thunderstorm  Can just suck you up  Well yeah  Probably not that low  But you may be  You get towed  To 1,200, 1,500 
[02:28:30]  A couple of thousand feet  You get towed up  You release  And then you play around  In the thermals  Thermals are  Columns of air  That heat up  Like a plowed field  Will radiate heat  More than a green field  So now there's  Hot air rising  And in that rising  Air  And you look for  The rising air  Either birds  Or clouds  Indicate there's  Rising air 
[02:29:00]  And you have  An instrument  On your panel  That tells you  That you're rising  Or falling  And so  And one time  A long time ago  One time  When I was circling  In a  In a thermal  A hawk  Got in the same thermal  And we were circling  Each other  Big red hawk  And me  And he was looking  At me  And I was looking  At him  It was the most  Incredible moment  That's pretty cool  Yeah  Did you write a song  About that?  Yeah that sounds like  A song  That's a song  I should have  Yeah I think so  I need to do another album  You can call it 
[02:29:30]  Chasing the hawk  Or is he chasing me  Oh  Very profound  Jimmy  So profound  How big is the circle  You're making  In these  Well it depends  On the size  Of the thermal  Sometimes thermals  Can be quite large  Sometimes they're  6-10 feet across  It just depends  Wow  Sucked up backwards  What did you finally do  When you're getting sucked up  How did you guys get down?  Well you fly out of it  And then you descend  And that's how  Gliders do distances  There  You can get a pin  I think it's 750 miles  Or you can do 
[02:30:00]  700  So you're rising  Going a distance  Find another thermal  Rise  Do another distance  And people fly  Forever like that  The limit  The limit is  How long you can stay awake  There is another type of flying  I've forgotten the term now  But when the wind blows  Like in Hawaii  Constantly  Like the trade wind  And it hits a cliff  And bounces up  It's like water  So you aim your glider  Into the rising air  At an angle  That is just enough 
[02:30:30]  To stop you from  Going forward  Or backward  And you're continually  In the air  Because that wind  Is continuing  Just kind of floating  And you're just floating  Wow  And I think the limit  Is like 50 something  It was when I was  Aware  It was like two days  And then the guy  Just sitting in one place  Sitting in one place  You couldn't stay awake  Any longer  That's amazing  That's pretty cool  And how long  Have you been a private pilot?  Oh a long time  A long time  I was doing  I was doing 
[02:31:00]  Something  A theater thing  In Miami  In the  Poinciana Playhouse  In Palm Beach  And there's an airfield  Next door  And I had always  Wanted to take lessons  So during the  During the day  When I wasn't working  At night  I was taking lessons  So I soloed  There  And went on to fly  In Santa Monica  Wow  I got even got  I even got  Checked out  In a biplane  In a pit special 
[02:31:30]  It's an aerobatics plane  Oh yeah  I got checked out  In an aerobatics plane  Wow  I did loops  You did  Yeah  It was incredible  You're quite the little  Daredevil there  I'm not afraid to fly  But I just didn't want  To be charged  That kind of money  Yeah 250 large  To  But I was  I was in  The desert  The Mojave Desert  When  That airplane  That  Technology  Was being tried out 
[02:32:00]  Oh right  And they got into space  100,000 feet  Yeah yeah yeah  They won a prize  They won 10 million dollars  I've forgotten what the  Name of the competition was  But that  That design  Won  10 million dollars  Because they were  The first ones in space  Using  Chopped up rubber  And nitric  Gas  Nitric oxide  I think  Instead of oxygen  And nitrogen  And all these guys  As a fuel  They were using  Chopped up rubber tires  And a gas  You can get in your dentist  Yeah like a 
[02:32:30]  Solid rocket booster  Yeah exactly  Instead of  Liquid oxygen  Yeah yeah  I guess anything  Mixed with enough oxygen  Will burn  So rubber  Seems to be a good  Right  Rocket fuel  Yes it was  What the  What the technology is  I don't know  But  Yeah  But it just  Blew it out  The back end  And  Maybe if you had  A few tires  Over there  On the enterprise  Scotty wouldn't have  Been up  Shit's Creek  So many times  You know  You go  Scotty  Scotty get me out of here  Chop up my tires  Chop up sometimes  I'm chopping tires 
[02:33:00]  As fast as I can  You know  Who would think  Such an archaic way  My god Bill  What's the height  You got to get to  To be considered  Breaking the atmosphere  I think it's  100,000 feet  Okay  100  Yeah yeah  Did you watch the jump  The Red Bull jump  I did  Oh that's  How insane was that  Well  It wasn't insane  Because he was  Very careful  He knew what he was doing  He knew what he was doing  Just as a regular  As a regular person  I see that as insane 
[02:33:30]  That's what I'm getting at Bill  It's insane  Only so far as  You and I are concerned  Right  He knew what he was doing  He's a stunt man  He calculated his chances  And look how famous he became  Yeah  As a means of making a living  As being famous for more than the 15 minutes  Right  When he opened that door  And like  Move forward  And get ready to jump  My understanding is that he thought  What am I doing  Yeah  He's looking down  You know  The one thing  And he gets 800 miles an hour  Yeah  He broke sound right 
[02:34:00]  He broke gas  Yeah  When you look at that view  When he opened the door  The thing that has to go through your mind  Is  It looks like I can miss the planet  Like you could just  If you jumped to the side a little too much  Imagine if you jumped and just started floating  Oh my god  Oh fuck  What about those guys who wear those wing suits  Yeah the wing suits  And fly through holes in the ground  I've seen those guys  And they fly next to mountains  Well next to mountains  But there's a guy who went through a hole  I know which one you're talking about  Really? 
[02:34:30]  A couple weeks ago  He went through a hole  Six feet in diameter  Yeah  Come on  Yeah  It's an unbelievable  He's going hundreds of miles an hour  Wow  And he has to calculate  He's got to get his body together  And he went right through it  That's nuts  I slipped through this thing  Like a needle  That's crazy  Some little hole in a rock formation  Yeah  Do they jump off the cliff  Or do they get out of an aircraft  He jumped off a cliff in this case  I believe  But they do jump out of aircraft  I've seen those guys jump off the cliff  And then instead of going away from the cliff  They go right next to it  Right  And they've got a head camera 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  And it's an amazing view  But you think  Wow you could really screw up  You see the ones that are ten feet off the ground  And they've got their buddies filming them  And they go fucking doing a flyby  Right over his head  With the wings  Right  Yeah  They're crazy  Yeah but they must know  They have to know  With their experience  It surely must take a lot of strength  To keep your arms spread out  At a hundred miles an hour  Yeah you would think that  Right  I mean if you tried it in a car  Yeah  And then to have a web  On your hands like that  And really be pushing your arms  Exactly 
[02:35:30]  I think you'd have to be in pretty good shape  And you know if you close them  You plummet  I guess that's a motivator  You don't have to keep me alive  Oh god  Did you see Gravity?  The movie?  No I haven't seen it yet  I hear it's wonderful  I liked it a lot  And not so much  I thought it was okay  I thought the effects are amazing  They've come so far with technology  And how space looks  And how they portray weightlessness  And what not  In movies now  It amazes me  Yeah  How they do that  Not that it was ever bad 
[02:36:00]  When you were up there  Mr. Shatner  I was dangling from a cable  From a cable  And you could see the cable  And see me turning slowly  In the wind  Well I do remember  Once you were outside the ship  Of course  And you were floating  And you kept disappearing  I think that was one  With the Tholian web  I think  Right  It was the Tholian web  And you were in that funny space suit  It kind of  Didn't really look like a space suit  It looked like  I remember  Like carpet waffle padding  The trouble we had  Was lighting the face 
[02:36:30]  How do you get light  On the face?  So they had like a  A light bulb  Somewhere  Turn the switch on  You gotta see Shatner's face  Turn on the light bulb  Yeah and floating around there  And I assumed it was  By cables  Or sometimes  Maybe even  I think your hands are just up  And you were on the floor  Doing this  And then they just  Kind of cut your feet off  In the shot  I don't remember  But probably  Maybe I want to forget  I don't think you could 
[02:37:00]  Ever forget that  Oh my god  This  You know  Just to come back  For a second  This album  Sure  Oh well of course  Is progressive rock  Yeah  And progressive rock  I've come to  Think of  As a science fiction  Of music  It's pushing the boundaries  It's pushing  It's opening up  Areas that  May not have been  There before  In this case  Billy Sherwood  Who is a progressive rock genius  Yeah from Yes  From Yes  And by the way 
[02:37:30]  Tony Kaye  And Scott Connor  And Ricky Tierney  Form a group called Circa  And I am going to be  Doing the album  With Circa  In three venues  In the Los Angeles area  Canoga Park  The Canyon Club  Is one of them  And 23rd, 24th  And 25th  Of this month  Of October  I'll be in the  Los Angeles area  Performing this album 
[02:38:00]  With these wonderful musicians  With the idea  Of seeing how good we are  Whether we're good enough  To go on  And tour  And maybe play  Places like Vegas  That's amazing  Yeah  Oh I would like to see that  Absolutely  I'm having  Such a journey  With this album  And this music video  Which is on  YouTube  Shot the music video  You know  On a shoestring  And  And  And then  Making the album 
[02:38:30]  And now  Performing the album  In front of public  The public is  A musical journey  I've never been on before  There is such a mystery  In music  There is  To the people  Who aren't music  Or haven't studied  Or aren't  Like  Somebody was saying  Finding one  Do you know what that means?  No  And here you are  You play records all the time  And nor did I  Well  One  Two  Three  Four  Two  Two  Three  Four  Right  So you've got to find one 
[02:39:00]  The drummer has to find one  And the bass guitarist  Has to find one  And that rhythm  When do you  How do you know  When to come in?  How do you know  After a long solo  Do you come in?  That is true  It's almost this instinctive thing  You kind of feel  No  It isn't  Well  Yeah but what if you don't feel good  That night?  Well that's true  You don't come in?  No you've got to come in  You've got to come in on  The guy finishes  The guy you've got to start  How do you know when to start?  It's mysterious  I'm telling you  You need all kinds of help  So that mystery 
[02:39:30]  Not only that  Not only the mystery  Of when to come in  You know the needs of the many  Outweigh the needs of the few  Or the one  That's right  Right  The needs of the one  That way the needs of the four  Or the count of seven  They even have  In this record  They have a count of seven  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven  One, two, three  Wow that's not even an even number  That's exactly  It's kind of odd  Yeah  So this mystery of rhythm is one  The other mystery for me is 
[02:40:00]  I saw Yo-Yo Ma play his cello  With the Los Angeles Philharmonic  Yeah  A couple of weeks ago  Have you ever seen him?  No  I had a friend  He hit his head once  That's too highbrow for us  And he couldn't say anything  But Yo-Yo Ma  He kept just blurting it out  Yo-Yo Ma  He got his head kicked by some guy  Is that a true story?  Yeah  Some guy kicked him in the head  And he kept saying Yo-Yo Ma  And he said Yo-Yo Ma  I don't know why  What is that?  I don't know  Some kind of brain thing I guess  He wouldn't have said No Mas? 
[02:40:30]  No  It was Yo-Yo Ma  Weird  Yo-Yo Ma  No  No  By the way  Yo-Yo Ma  The great cellist  Right  So he  I watched him play  And the cello in his hand  And the bow in his other hand  It was like an extension  Not only just his body  But of his soul  He played the music  He was alive in the music  And that 
[02:41:00]  The mystery of  In this case  The cello  The cat gut  And the horse hair  And this gorgeous sound  Emerges  We're the only  We're the only animal  That does that  There are other animals  That sing  And make music  With their voice  But who makes a tool  To make music  Which on the surface of it  Should be screeching  It just sounds like  It would be ridiculous  Ridiculous  And yeah  Exactly  And if you don't play it  Right  It is ridiculous  Like a little 
[02:41:30]  My grandchild  Playing the violin  You know  My grandchild  Got violin lessons  She'd never really  Heard a violin  One day she heard  The violin  And she said  Oh that's what  It's supposed to sound like  And it really is odd  That you can teach someone  No matter how much  They practice  And how much you teach them  They just can't be as good  As somebody who has  A natural talent for it  So there's just this  Natural ability  That can't be taught  And I wonder about that  Is it a natural ability 
[02:42:00]  Is it  Is it somebody  Is it a child  Who lets  Or I guess  Who lets themselves  Be totally open  To the experience  So that they go  With the experience  Rather than saying  I'm not good  And get self-conscious  And restricts themselves  Whether  No matter what the skill is  Maybe that's it  Yeah yeah  But that's more  It is kind of a difference  Between something mathematical  And something spiritual  You know  Is it something  That could be  Looked at in an equation  Or is it a more  Spiritual  Exactly 
[02:42:30]  So that mystery  Of the music  Is the journey  I'm on now  Discovering  I'm into the words  But  Billy Sherwood  Composing the music  And knitting  Music and words  Together  It's like an  Undiscovered country  Yeah  It was the best  Of all those movies  I liked that one  I did  I liked them all  What do you listen to  Please  What do you listen to  What kind of music  Well  I'm probably a jazz enthusiast 
[02:43:00]  Yeah  And hates jazz  I don't like jazz  I want to like jazz  You can't hate jazz  He hates it  I don't hate it  But I can't  It's telling me out  You can't  He hates  This guy hates it  You can't  You can't  I  No  No  You're not  Listening to music  That pleases you  Jazz takes so many forms  You can't hate jazz  Jazz could be the blues  I mean  Well  I know  He doesn't like the blues  Jazz to me  You can't hate the blues  He hates the blues  He likes disco  I don't like disco  He loves guns though 
[02:43:30]  I don't like disco  It begins and ends  With Donna Summer  No  I don't like it  When it sounds like  Everybody in the band  Is playing something  Completely different  It sounds very self-indulgent  Alright so listen  On one of the cuts  Al Demiola  The great jazz guitarist  Is on my record  Al Demiola is playing  On my album  Ponder the Mystery  He plays a lick  On one of the songs  It's fantastic  Steve Vai 
[02:44:00]  Oh right  Yeah  Playing guitar  In the opening number  Makes me weep  With the wrenching feeling  Of his electric guitar  Which one is he on?  He's on the first one  Where it's gone  Where it's gone  Is that the one  We should play today?  Play that  Play that  When we're done here  We're going to do that for you  Okay  Yeah definitely  You know I was watching  Columbo the other night  Yeah  And there was  Dr. Janice Lester  And Tupring  The Vulcan bride  On the same episode  That's impossible 
[02:44:30]  I've never seen them together  I've never seen them together  But there it was  I'm like  This is like a Star Trek cavalcade  I'm watching on Columbo  You were in a Columbo too  I was in more than one  I did more than one  Yeah yeah  Those were great shows  The only bad thing about him  You missed the first five minutes  You might as well  Not watch the show  The problem  The difficulty  With that show  And the problem  For writing for it  Was  You the audience  Knew who did it  Yes  And you had to watch  With fascination  While the character  In the movie  Figures it out 
[02:45:00]  Knows what you  Already know  Right  And that was the difficulty  In writing for it  They pulled it off though  Oh yeah  It works  It's a fun show to watch  Great, great character  And then you just see people  From, you know  From old episodes  Of Bonanza  And Star Trek  Yeah, well everybody  Wanted to do it  An hour and a half  It paid well  You know  And it was well written  So you wanted to be on that show  Some really good directors too  Where you'd watch the credits  And see like  Oh my gosh 
[02:45:30]  Spielberg did that  Really  Well Spielberg started off  At Universal  Doing  Right  Little  They did Duel  That movie Duel  Duel  With  It was  McLeod  Who played McLeod  That guy  Yeah  The guy with the limp  The guy with the limp  And the  Little  Dennis Weaver  Thank you sir  Yeah, yeah  And he did  He directed Duel  Right  And  Peter Matheson  Wrote it  Yeah, yeah  And  These were all great names 
[02:46:00]  Of people just starting  Their career  At the time  Yeah  That  Night Gallery  Was another show  Rod Serling's  Night Gallery  There was a lot of  Young  At the time  Directors  That were doing that  I actually wanted to ask  About Rod Serling  Because we kind of  Have a fascination  With him here  What was he like  To be around  Well  I wish I could say  That  He was a mentor  To everybody  You know  I was  As you were asking me  I thought  Well  Would I make up  He was a child molester 
[02:46:30]  That won't come  Yay  So  No  Better not  His widow  Will sue me  You know  What you're asking  Is  I as a young actor  Just sort of  Beginning and  Knocking on doors  What did I think  Of the producer  Who was up  In the building  And I  Up in the  Offices  I never got to  But  In this case  I had worked  With him  And  A group of the people 
[02:47:00]  That he took  With him  From live television  To film  When he was doing  Twilight Zone  So I had worked  With Rod  In live television  In the latter part  Of the  Live television days  I  Came  I came  From Canada  And I did  Playhouse 90  And all those  Hour shows  That were famous  At the time  And he  And a host  Of people  Whose names  You would recognize  From movies  Where they're  Beginning their  Career  Just like you're  Saying now  About these 
[02:47:30]  Early film stuff  They  They were  Burgeoning  So I did  Get to know  Him a little  Bit  A cool guy  Short in stature  Enormous  Talent  Creative talent  As a writer  And he did  Mentor a lot  Of people  How long  Did it take you  To film that  Famous episode  The man on the  Way up there  They were all  Three, four, five  Days maybe  Yeah  And being a  Pilot  You know  You'd know  What that  Stupid little  Furry guy  Can do out there 
[02:48:00]  Being afraid  Of flying  According to  Arliss  I don't know  Where those  Things come from  But it's the  It's insane  It makes you  Think how  All the stuff  We want to  Believe  You know  So and so  Was sleeping  With so and so  Oh yeah  It's  You know  So much  Of it's made  Up  I don't know  Where they get  It from  Like afraid  Of flying  I mean  How would  Yeah  If they do  A little research  They could tell  That you're  A pilot  Hey  Did the little  Man  Who was the  Little man  In the costume 
[02:48:30]  On the way  Did you get  To know him  At all  He's a  Czechoslovakian  Or was  A Czechoslovakian  Acrobat  Oh wow  In a little  Furry suit  That was ridiculous  I mean  It was ridiculous  Standing  You know  You'd think  They'd give him  Wings  Or  Some streamlining  Or something  Yeah  He was a little  Panda bear  On the edge  Of a wing  And when he  Flew off  Yeah  He just  Kind of  Pulled him up  Out of frame  Exactly  And 
[02:49:00]  Like you were  Saying  Our special effects  Were so bad  Which tells you  That the audience  Is willing to  Suspend disbelief  On anything  If the story  Is good  Right  Right  The biggest  Thing  Problem I had  With the episode  Was  Just tell the wife  Who's so concerned  With her husband  At the time  Because he had  This nervous breakdown  Look  Sit here  And look out  The window  The whole flight  Just stay there  Don't move  There  Problem solved 
[02:49:30]  Either she sees it  Or it never shows up again  And he's fine  Yeah but she was so tired  She had to sleep  Oh she had it with you  She had to sleep  She had narcolepsy  It really shows  How far we've gone  Because the  Sky marshal  Or whatever he was  The cop that was  On board the plane  He's asleep  With his gun  Just hanging out  In the aisle  And yet  Iconic episode  Right  Why  Yeah  Why  What is the answer 
[02:50:00]  To why  I think the story  Hits home  With a fear of flying  A fear of the unknown  It didn't matter  That the effects  Weren't that good  And a fear of not being heard  Seeing something that's wrong  And saying it  And nobody believing you  Were listening to you  Oh that's interesting  You must have had a lot of that  In your life  I have it every day of my life  Actually continually  I tell a woman  I'm perfect for you  And she just doesn't hear me  My favorite  My favorite scene  In that whole episode  Is when the  Co-pilot I guess  Comes out  And he's talking  And you say 
[02:50:30]  There's a man out there  And he goes  We know  We've seen  And he goes  And you go  Oh you've seen  Oh  Oh  Okay  Like you're all thrilled  That he finally saw  And then you realize  Oh he's bullshitting me  I've never thought of that  But you're absolutely right  I bet it's  I told him that  He said it was about  A fear of hairy men on wings  I'm like you're an idiot  I don't know what you're talking about  Yeah maybe he's seeing something  That no one else sees 
[02:51:00]  Because Sterling had that weird  You know  It's not being heard  You know  How many children  That's got to be  Such a basic impulse  You don't think about that  But children at a table  Who say  I got  Let me  And the adults  Are all talking  And nobody's listening to them  And that rage  And frustration  Of not being heard  Has got to be  Something we carry with us  For the rest of our lives  Yeah  Well look at that  Yeah  That's what I do  I just analyze  How about  Would you talk to the little 
[02:51:30]  Czechoslovakian guy  Like crap  I'm fascinated with that guy  You were talking about  Like crap services  Or  The  The  The  Primitiveness  Of the technology  Didn't occur to me  That  Yeah  And looking at it now  I  I don't know why  I didn't think  This is so idiotic  I'm embarrassed to be  In this  That's how I feel  Every day  But then you just  Have to look around  They're saying 
[02:52:00]  We've got to wrap up  Oh god  Bill they're saying  You've got to go  You've got TV  Bill's very busy today  I've got a day  I'm promoting  Ponder the Mysteries  Yes  Yes  But this is really  Worth promoting  It's a terrific album  It's gotten great reviews  By the way  Make a good Christmas gift  Bill  A great Christmas gift  Very good  It's a meaningful album  It means you really love  The person you're giving it to  Absolutely  You look damn good  On the cover there  I know  Pretty good huh  Yeah there is a very  Regal kind of  With the sun behind them

[02:53:30]  Nothing alive  Filled with strife  Seeing the beauty  But feeling apart  Where it's gone  I don't know  I'm missing something  I'm missing something  Give it back  A piece of me  I let it go  Lost in my life  Where's the peace  The least of life  I looked around me 
[02:54:00]  Nothing alive  Where is the peace  The least of mine  Seeing the beauty  And feeling apart  Seeing the beauty  But feeling apart  Where's the love  And what am I doing  Go too fast  What is past  Does not inform the future  Where's the peace  The least of life

[02:55:00]  Where it's gone  I don't know  I'm missing something  Give it back  A piece of me  And let it go 
[02:55:30]  Where it's gone  I don't know  Where is the peace  The least of mine  I'm lost in my life  Seeing the beauty and feeling apart 
[02:56:00]  My body aches  And my brain tries to wait to the setting sun  The stirring seas that have no heart  But cold and endless  Leaves me afraid  The sand is harsh  And the land is bleak  And the freakish light is pale  I need heat  Or is it warmth?  I'm missing something  Give it back  A piece of me  I let it go  And where it's gone 
[02:56:30]  I don't know  I'm getting it back  guitar solo

Did they finally get Shatner out of there?  Yeah, they finally moved  I was a big fan  Beamed him  Oh, you did?  Yeah  I enjoyed Star Trek  Stop talking  Stop talking 
[03:08:00]  Shatner just does not really enjoy Star Trek references  No, he hates  Did you hear what I said to him before?  All right  I was like, I have Craig Schickle  Why don't you beat me up?  Did he like that?  He did  He laughed and smiled  No, he didn't  Kenny  His publicist had a wrong schedule  Yeah, we know  I know  I apologized to him  I said, look  I don't want you to think we got you out of there  No, but she admitted  She goes, no, no  Yeah, I know  But I want to make sure he knew  That it wasn't from our side  You want me to email you this shot?  Did you talk to him about anything?  I'll put it on my Facebook club 
[03:08:30]  Soda Kenny  Oh, okay  That's a great question  Doomsday Machine  Did you talk to him about anything?  Simon Earth?  No  He was talking business to his manager  Well, you should have just said  Trying to avoid Anthony  You should have said something like that  You know  In the menagerie  You know  I didn't want to steer him in the wrong direction  What?  In the Corbamite maneuvers  You should have been like  Hey  Did you  What?  What?  No, T.J. Hooker?  Nah, just Star Trek  I prefer this Cap Kirk 
[03:09:00]  Shut up  Cap the Kirk  Oh, look at the time  Oh, look at the time  Yeah, yeah  Okay, I gotta walk like this  Is it good?  Yeah  I'll tweet this a little bit  Oh, I gotta see that  You gotta do a little acting with Mr. Shatner  I had to do the Spock  When he walks away after he gets the mains online 
[03:09:30]  For the Enterprise  And he's radiation  He's got radiation poisoning  He walks over to the glass  Very slowly  Oh, I should have went  Ship out of danger  Oh  You know  I would have won him over  I was all caught up in the moment  We could do a close-up  Let's cold call  We could do it  Cut it in  I could cut it in  Cut it in  Hey, Sam  On the after show  Can you give away the  Smudgy William Shatner autograph  That's a big  That's a big prize  That is a big prize  It's smudging as we speak 
[03:10:00]  Doesn't matter  No one has touched it  No one touched it  It's the weird cover  You can't sign them  That will never dry to the point  Where it will just brush off  It's disappearing  You guys should all put your fingerprints on it  So that way it's even more famous  What do you do?  Not you, Craig  Should we put tape over it or something?  What should we do?  Oh, man  Just leave it there  It's going away  It ruins the value  It's going away  If you put tape over that  And then someone tries to take it down  At the Pawn Stars place  They'll be like  Ah, if the tape wasn't on here  I'd give you ten grand for it  I've got to re-sign it 
[03:10:30]  This, um  I don't know  I've got to authenticate it  Let's go home  Yeah  After the show next  Blah, blah, blah  Watch out now  The O.P. and Anthony show continues  Sort of  After O.N.A. Live  With Sam Roberts  Is next  This  Is after O.P. and Anthony Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Somebody get that guy out of the studio 
[03:11:00]  He can't be in here anymore  This is a risk for everyone involved  Everybody's still here  Anthony's leaving  Craig Schenkel is still here  Roland is here  O.P. is here  And he who will not be named  Is still in  Stop it, Craig  Just creepy touch  You can't  You can't be in here  No, I don't think you can  You can  It's too much of a temptation 
[03:11:30]  For everybody  Here  Here's the smudgy  It's getting worse by the minute  He really did cheese out on it  What are we going to do?  Because someone really would want that  Let me see  I mean, we'll still give it away  But it's a very after show  Autograph  It's not a very main show prize  Stop it  Are people loving Craig Schenkel?  No  And you can't  You can't be in here  Even if not  Even not talking  Because you have a short fuse 
[03:12:00]  Don't play his music, dude  You have a short fuse  And that's been documented now  You should go  You gotta have respect for this studio  And the rules  What?  You can hear your lips moving a little bit  And that's not good  It's not good  What?  Craig, take a hike  Okay  Alright, I'll see you later  I gotta walk like this  Can I have a hug?  No, you can't have a hug  I understand you don't get a lot of human contact 
[03:12:30]  You're not a likable person  Just keep walking  You just do everything so slowly  And methodically  But there's no method  Everything is just a nuisance to you  Alright  Obi, what are you doing over there?  What?  What are you doing?  I'm hanging out  Get out of here  Craig Schenkel  The new character  Just comes over and like  Lightly touches and rubs and hugs 
[03:13:00]  Cause he didn't have enough human contact  I'm so sick of Jim and all his characters  Oh shit, this is going fast  What is?  You're uploading the Shatner video?  Yeah, I hope it's good quality  The Shatner video was funny  It was like  The visual representation  Of all the awkward silliness that happens  When Ant insists on incessantly bringing up Star Trek episodes  It was great  It's my favorite thing he does  When he just starts  You guys will be on something  You're talking about today  You were talking about him flying 
[03:13:30]  Or whatever it was  And Ant would just always have to bring him back to Star Trek episodes  He doesn't want to talk about that  He laughs pretty good over it though  Yeah  70%  70% uploaded  75%  We went  This was a very social media heavy show  What do you mean?  Why?  Well, we got this going right up on YouTube  The photo  Of William Shatner and Club Soda Kenny  Is up on  Not Sam  On Twitter and Instagram  That was just an excuse to plug your fucking shit 
[03:14:00]  No, we were talking about social media  What are you talking about?  Not Sam on Instagram  And Twitter  Is where you can see the photo  Of Kenny and William Shatner  Well, Anthony doing some acting with Mr. Shatner  Will be live in moments  On my YouTube channel, OP Radio  And I will be tweeting it at OP Radio on Twitter  I would hope that one gets some views  And congratulations to Brad Hines  Who's Brad Hines?  Latest winner of the signed Sudoku puzzle  Oh, are you doing that on Twitter now? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, it's becoming a thing  It is  You're pushing  It's becoming a little thing  Alright  It really is  When we're stuck with  This cheesed out William Shatner autograph  Yeah  People should call in  If they want to win  The cheesed out William Shatner autograph  But let them know that  Oh, you can spray it  With what?  Go get  Messer and Nicole's hairspray  They're saying you can spray it  I've heard this before  If you spray it with hairspray?  That'll never survive the male  Don't touch it 
[03:15:00]  Alright, alright  It isn't dry  It's been  It's never going to be dry  It's been a long time  It's on that very shiny  Fucking  How do you explain it?  That shiny surface  The glossy  It's glossy  Extremely  It's too glossy  Yeah  It's the super gloss  And it's the  I must say the record label  Wasn't thinking  In terms of signed copies  In terms of signed copies  They're fucking over Mr. Shatner  And that's the only reason  To put out physical media  When you got a William Shatner CD  Is to try to get him to sign it  There's nowhere to sign that thing  No 
[03:15:30]  Maybe the disc  But who gets the disc signed?  What a bunch of assholes  Alright  So more Terry Clifford tomorrow  Yeah, I can't wait  That's going to be great  Are you going to have to  Put out your warnings  Ahead of time again  Saying, look  I think Terry Clifford's  A nice person  Before you can get back into it  Or do today's count for tomorrow  No one's buying it  I'm just  I'm just trying to cover my ass  I'm so glad we get the real  Greg Hughes here  Alright, Sam  Everyone wants the  Bill Shatner autograph  Even though it's cheesed out 
[03:16:00]  Let's try the hairspray thing  That could be a whole thing  On the after show  Alright  Getting the hairspray  Maybe  Maybe then you can have  Like a celebrity  Sprayer  Like mashup Nicole  She'll spray the William Shatner  Are you applying for  Producer of the after show?  Because we are looking for one  Go fuck your mother  E-Rock, do we have  Mashup Nicole?  We sent the intern down  Oh, you listen to me  Of course I do  Now it's going to be a thing  E-Rock, I pay you tomorrow  Okay  What's the amount?  What's the percentage?

Yes  Holy shit  A healthy percentage  He's got you over a barrel, huh?  A healthy percentage  Are you happy with the percentage, Eric?  I don't know what the percentage is  Oh, you haven't told him  Tomorrow goes down  On the air?  Tomorrow goes down  Any of this fucking horse shit  Of going to break  And ending the show?  No  You know, people really didn't understand  When I put it on the  Worst of the Week countdown  Yeah  They thought I'd cut it off  For the countdown  Yeah, I got a lot of shit 
[03:17:00]  Written to me  Like, you assholes  You didn't time it out right  Yeah, because we deal with dummies  Yeah  We all know that now  Yeah  Can you mail this?  Yeah, just leave it over there  We'll take care of it  No, I'm serious  The guy really wants it for real  I understand  I've done the other ones  Just leave them there  One a day  That's all I can do, people  And are we going to do it on the air?  The E-Rock money?  Yeah  I mean, to end the bit, sure  Okay  And is there going to be  An amount announced tomorrow?  This is the most teasing  Ever happened for an  Opin' Anthony show  The continuation of 
[03:17:30]  Terry Clifford tomorrow  And  It's going to hurt  The E-Rock money thing  Happening tomorrow  It's going to hurt tomorrow  It's going to hurt a lot  What  Have you ever gone home  And known what the show  Is going to be like tomorrow?  Like this is  There's two things  Happening tomorrow  Wow, I could really  Fucking call it in tomorrow  Yeah, I mean  It's already planned out for you  See, I told you  Go to the game  A few years ago  You're right  Are we continuing  Jocktober  And then doing  A new Jocktober  For the day?  Why the fuck  Are you trying to give me  More work? 
[03:18:00]  I'm not trying to give you  More work  I thought you had a lot  Saved up  No, I don't have anything  Saved up  I'm working like  You know, I'm hanging on  I didn't know that  I'm a cliffhanger here  Like Stallone  You see all the gossip websites  Are now picking up  On that Stallone story  It was all over  1010 wins this morning  Because TMZ put it out  So everybody else got it  TMZ has photos  That everybody took with him  And paid $3.95 for  Gawker's got a whole bunch  Of stuff up about it  It's funny  That everybody's  Picking up on it now  And the problem now  Is that  At these conventions 
[03:18:30]  Because he raised the bar  Because people will pay that  They'll get other big celebrities  And charge that  If not more  Because people will pay that  Yeah, like Kurt Russell  Was sitting at home  Going, oh shit  People are going to pay $400 for that  I'm sure I can get $250  Can you sign this  What is it?  The Computer War  Tennis Shoes?  Yeah  Yeah  People bring in  Tennis Shoes and everything  Although I would pay  To get Stargate signed  Kurt Russell is sitting there  Going, what?  Sigourney Weaver's  Getting two bills?  I can get more than  Sigourney Weaver  She had a huge line too  Well, Alien 
[03:19:00]  Yeah  Ghostbusters  Because the Ghostbusters exhibit  Was right here  What's Sal  I'm listening to Sal  And the intern argue  I don't know  Over the phones  Why  How come  What was the problem  With that intern?  Some fucking idiot  Keeps on calling in  And asking a  Irrelevant question  Oh, and he just won't stop  He just won't stop  Yeah  What a moron  So did we get any  Word from Nicole  From the morning mashup?  Intern Nikki  Went around  And asked every girl  Here for hairspray  No one has any  No one has hairspray?  Look, I know this is radio 
[03:19:30]  But you girls  Clean yourself up  A little bit  You know  Why don't you  Have the materials  To show up here  Looking professional  No wonder everybody  Always looks so  Shitty and dried out  All the time  My god  I guess Eric  Is now gonna go  On the hunt  For hairspray  Eric's gonna go  To his own drawer  He doesn't trust  Yeah, Eric's probably  Got some hairspray  Eric has everything  In that drawer  He's got his spiky hair  I'll bet he's got  Hairspray from his bleach days  You know  When he was coming in  And fixing that shit  Sal, what happened 
[03:20:00]  I'm gonna switch mics  But what happened  Was Jim upset  I was in the bathroom  Jim was upset  That the one sheet  Said that William Shatner  Is afraid of flying  Well, no  I spoke to Jim  About it afterwards  He completely understands  Now it's just that  On the piece of paper  I wrote that  The Daily Mail  Reported this  That, you know  Branson said this  And, you know  Miscommunication  Is what you're telling me  Miscommunication  We cleared it up  In the hallway  And, you know  Everything's cool now  So happy to hear  Yes  So, Brandon in Dallas 
[03:20:30]  If I spray this thing  With hairspray  You're telling me  It'll work?  Yeah, just  Just use like an aerosol  Don't use a spray  Because then it will  Bunch up  But use like an aerosol  Kind  And it will just  It'll dry  And then it won't  Smudge anymore  I got gas duster  Will that work?  Yeah, that might  Spread it around  Oh, let me see  What else I got here  I got  What about Lysol?  If you want to clean it  Well, you want to  Send something clean  And then  And then you can sign it 
[03:21:00]  And I'll take it  You want me  You want me to sign  The William Shatner CD as well?  Yeah, spray it with lice  So I'll clean that off  And then you sign it  And send it to me  That's smart  That's smart  Uh  John in West Virginia  Yeah  What's up, buddy?

Oh, hell yeah  Without a doubt  Alright, I'm going to  Put you back on hold 
[03:21:30]  Because we're going to  Try to figure out  What we can do  Uh  In terms of  Uh  Getting the signature stuck  I think we are going to  Try some hairspray  If you can find any  Listen  I have been meaning to tell you guys  About Orange is the New Black  You know about that show  House of Cards  You know about that show  Arrested Development  All these great shows  That Netflix are doing, right?  Are you ready for the next big thing  From Netflix?  Prepare yourself  For Notorious  Netflix's newest comedy special  Starring international stand-up sensation  Russell Peters 
[03:22:00]  Russell started doing stand-up  As a kid in his native Toronto  And now he's one of the biggest comedians  In the world  With over 75 million views on YouTube  Nearly a million Facebook fans  And one of the most diverse audiences on the planet  He's sold out arenas  Like Madison Square Garden  And Sydney's Royal Opera House  Also  Launching at the same time  With Russell's new special  Is Notorious  Notorious, obviously  Is Russell Peters vs. the World  An exclusive four-part series 
[03:22:30]  That takes you behind the scenes  On Russell's tour  And has tons  Of great outtakes and interviews  With his family and friends  Don't miss Notorious  Excuse me, Sal  Notorious  I got very excited about this  Russell Peters special  I almost  I almost lost my professionalism  For a moment  Don't miss Notorious  And Russell Peters vs. the World  Now streaming  Only on Netflix  I'm definitely gonna go home  And catch that  Yes  I love him  He's so funny, dude  He's so funny  Uh-oh  Conflicting report 
[03:23:00]  As it goes with the phones  We had one guy calling up  Saying what you gotta do  Is put hairspray on it  Dave in Pennsylvania  Yeah, don't  Don't you dare put hairspray  It's water-soluble  That'll just wash off  I'd go to a frame shop  And have somebody  Put matte spray on it  Well, I'm not gonna do that  Before I send it out  To somebody  Why don't we just saran wrap it  Maybe saran wrap  And leave it in the  And you have to leave it  In the saran wrap  Yeah  Yeah, a little scotch tape  That'll just look sweet  Yeah, put some packaging tape  Over it  No problem  Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah 
[03:23:30]  Cheese it up  Yeah, yeah  I mean, cheese it up  Shatner already cheesed out  On the thing  You might as well  Alright  Uh, John in West Virginia  Yeah  I like the cut of your jib  That's not racist, is it?  You can say that still, right?  I don't think so  Yeah, I think that's okay  Alright  I am going to send you  The CD autograph  Because you said  Such nice things about me  You're my hero, sir  Good  Alright  I'm gonna put you on hold  Take his autograph  Uh, take his address  Thank you, John in West Virginia 
[03:24:00]  But we're still gonna try  To make this  As safe as possible  I might still try  To spray some  Hairspray on it  Just to double check  Maybe I should spray  Some Lysol on it  I mean  Just see  Cause William Shatner  Signed this CD  And it's on super glass  Are you gonna put Lysol on it?  Well, it's an aerosol  Isn't it?  No, but that has alcohol on it  Oh, it won't do  That's gonna eat away  At the whole fucking thing  Alright, alright  That's not a good idea  Good thing you jumped in  Because I wasn't really  You saw it in my hand  I saw it in your hand  I was like  What are these gonna do?  I was about to  Cause I thought it was  Just in the spray  No, no, no  So what's in hairspray? 
[03:24:30]  Uh, I don't know  That sticky stuff?  I don't think there's any alcohol  In the spray  Well, yeah  Because the problem is  That William Shatner's CD  It's called  Ponder the Mystery  And it's all glossy  And Shatner signed it  But it's got that weird  Sort of  Sharpie  You know  Is not  The ink's not sticking  To the gloss autograph  There's like holes  In the signature  Yeah, it looks like porous  Yeah, it's very porous  It looks like a  Like a  What are those stones  In the ocean?  Pumice  Hummus?  No, that's a 
[03:25:00]  That's a dip  You don't know  What you're talking about, Sal  You're out of your mind  Oh my god  Well  Today was a very special show  As we  Uh, wait to see  If Eric can find  Any of his hairspray  He may have used it all  Uh, I was so excited  That Avril  Did you find any hairspray?  No, nobody has any  That's weird  I went to the Cosmo studio  The Cosmo office  Nobody has anything  Everybody around here  Is so ugly  Why couldn't they  Pretty them  That's why  Come in with  A little hairspray  You're telling me  I even went to the guys  Who you'd think 
[03:25:30]  Would have hairspray  He who will not be named  Who does the production  For this show  And other departments  Yeah  Um, and they all  Just have like  Styling gel  Styling gel?  What is this?  1999 middle school  Photo day?  No  Hairspray's the shit  Right now  God damn it  Alright, well look  John, I'm gonna try  To send this to you  Some way or another  Are you  Sal said I shouldn't  Put Lysol on this thing  Is that true?  Should I really not?  I mean  I would not try it  Unless it's  You know what it is?  Unless it's the alcohol 
[03:26:00]  That's in hairspray  Is what takes care of it  It might work  Just eliminate  It kills 99%  Of viruses  And bacterias  So that could be  Very helpful  Because you don't know  How many hands  This CD has passed through  Maybe not yet  Maybe I'll do  Try it  You think so?  Go for it  We ran out of options here  And I'm not paying  For hairspray  I'm gonna put some  On the non-signature part  And see what happens  Alright  I think you need to  Move back a little bit  From that  Oh, thank you  No, no, no  Off the CD 
[03:26:30]  Don't go right on it  Or it also turns into liquid  Oh, right, right  You're right  Okay  What's Sal coming in here for?  Panic  I'm gonna put a little  I'm seeing the fucking  The fucking thing  I'm gonna put a little bit  On the non-signature part  Okay, first  Okay  No, it just makes it wet  It just  It just makes it wet  And smell like disinfectant  I'm gonna put a little bit  On the signature  It might stick better  No, no, no, no 
[03:27:00]  This was a bad idea  It's running  Oh, no  Yeah  These colors don't run  Yes, they do  I can see it  Okay, I'm gonna try  I'm gonna try to lay it flat  Don't worry, John  Who just won this  William Shatner already  Cheesed up this autograph  So it's not that big of a deal  Sam, even if it goes away  We just re-sign it  Oh, really?  We have extra copies?  No, we'll just re-sign  Re-sign this one?  Yeah  Yeah, maybe we'll just try  To fill it in with magic marker  And nail polish  Or something like that  Well  We'll get that out to you  Oops, I bent it  But I was picking it up 
[03:27:30]  This is not turning into  A good prize  No, maybe I should  Put it away for now  I can't be trusted with it  Uh  972  Hey, let me talk to Sam  How are these guys  Such idiots, man?  You're on the air  Sam  What's up, buddy?  It's the glue  Not the glue  But the sticky stuff  In the spray  The hairspray  That's going to seal that  Oh, okay  So the Lysol thing  Really was a bad idea  Yeah, yeah  That's a bad idea  I don't understand 
[03:28:00]  How you guys know shit  About Comic Con  I don't know  I don't know  Nothing useful  Yeah, I don't know  Why would we know that?  Well, he's right, though  I mean, if you go to Comic Con  You want to get autographs  You're trying to collect them  And, like, autograph collectors  Know how to preserve things  And frame things  And all that  And not get stuff signed  That's heavily glossed  Is that right?  Yeah  I'm really bad about this stuff  I bent it a little  I have E-Rock go to  A dollar store  And he can get him  Some cookies while he's there  E-Rock, you hear that?  If you go to a dollar store 
[03:28:30]  You get some cookies  While you're there  Okay  Is that incentive?  Not really  You're not a cookie guy?  Not a cookie guy  Alright, well  If you can figure out a snack  You want this at the dollar store  Pick up some hairspray  For John in West Virginia  Who just won this thing  Fritos  Yeah  Get yourself  Look at a bag of Fritos  Get yourself a dollar's worth  Of Fritos on me  Okay, buddy?  Thanks, Sam  Alright, buddy  I was very excited today  Some of my favorite guests  Well, William Shatner  Is always a favorite guest of mine  Because Ant always does  The embarrassing Star Trek fan stuff  That always just makes him feel awkward  Shatner gets a good laugh 
[03:29:00]  Out of it every time  You gotta see this video  Once Obi puts it up, though  Because after Shatner  So Shatner  I pulled a clip, too  Of him being really annoyed  During the conversation  Let me hear it  Give me one second  Okay  Okay, so Shatner comes in  And he's talking about  Like, you know  What we were talking about  With Sal  And the perceived mistake  On the one sheet  He's talking about  Being afraid to fly  He's talking about  Things that he doesn't  Talk about in every interview  And he's just  Conversating like a human being  That's one of the strengths 
[03:29:30]  Of the Opie and Anthony show  That guests come in here  That you don't normally hear  As human beings  You hear them  In their  Doing their celebrity thing  Right?  They're either  Trying to duck and weave  Around gossip  Or they're just pushing  Whatever project it is to push  Here on this show  Specifically today  With William Shatner  You kind of got into  Some meat of something  Some of his hobbies  He was talking about gliding  And piloting a plane  And all this stuff  When Ant, of course  Has to bring him back  To Star Trek 
[03:30:00]  And he's just doing it  To annoy him  Let me hear a little bit of it  And knitting music  And words together  It's like an undiscovered country  Yeah  It was the best  Of all those movies  Because he's sitting there  He's trying to promote  This CD  Ponder the mystery  And he's got  He's got everything right  You laughed over  The big sigh though  Was there  Okay, play it again  Yeah, I'll play it again here  And knitting music  And words together 
[03:30:30]  It's like an undiscovered country  Yeah  It was the best  Of all those movies  He's trying to finally  Get away from this  Star Trek thing  It's what he's been doing  For like however  30 years  Not even just Star Trek  Star Trek on this show  Everything  The last several interviews  Ant worked that in  Of course  And now Shatner knows  Do not  Come into this studio  If you don't want to  Talk about Star Trek  Because then he leaves  And he's outside 
[03:31:00]  Because I guess his people  Took him out of the show  Because they looked  At the schedule wrong  And so he ended up  Awkwardly  Shatner  William Shatner  Is awkwardly  Sitting in the hall  Next to Club Soda Kenny  For like 15 minutes  And it's the weirdest  Site ever  I posted a picture  As I said earlier  On Instagram  But Opie was able  To get a video  Of Ant  Reenacting  Wrath of Khan  I believe was the movie  Through the glass  And Shatner  Just being like  What are you doing 
[03:31:30]  Lady Trucker  Hey  Lady  Underscore  Trucker  On Twitter  I just tweeted  This is Opie's video  So it's out there  It's out there  Is it on the Facebook page  Eric Nagel  I didn't know he  Actually had it up  I'll put it up now  Yeah I guess he was  Uploading it on his phone  As he left  But yeah it's hilarious  Definitely check that out  Marshall in Texas  Sam the Sham  What's up buddy  Hey man first of all  You hurt my feelings man  I called in for the  Stupid shitty book  From Shatner  You mean the CD 
[03:32:00]  Whatever it is  And I  Well he cheesed out  On the autograph  Yeah he cheesed it  Totally  But I've been a fan  Of AOAL  Since its inception man  Well I gave it away  What do you want me  I mean do you want  The Lysol  That I used  I have some other  Stuff we could give away  That's my joke  Or as I call it  AOAL  But anyway  So I figured out  Why  I thought you were  Concerned about Troy  Right  I thought you were  Concerned about his job  But it didn't fit  With what I know about you 
[03:32:30]  Why  But anyway  Now I realize  It's because you  Can't resist  Starting drama  So you have to  Keep him out of the studio  But if I wanted  To start drama  I would want Troy  In the studio  But you just said  At the beginning of the show  You're like  Don't let him in here  Don't let him in here  And it's because of  Your addiction  To starting shit  You know  You would draw him in  Oh  You're saying  I'm saving myself  Yes  That I know  Now it all makes sense 
[03:33:00]  Oh maybe this is  Some deep  Deep  Psychological thinking  That I don't even  Maybe I'm not even aware  I'm doing this  This is deep in my subconscious  That I don't want  Troy in here  Because I know  That I will get him  To do something  That will get us both  In trouble  Well right  Because I couldn't  Figure out  I'm like  Sam doesn't care  About Troy  What is this shit  Now I get it  It's your own hide  That you're protecting  That's exactly  Maybe you're right Marshall  You know what  How about I send you a copy  Of The Hangover 3  On Blu-ray  Hell yeah  Sammy you're the man 
[03:33:30]  Alright I'll put you on hold  He just want a copy of The Hangover 3  On Blu-ray  See that's what happens  We get and we give  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live  The other thing that was exciting  About today  I love the surprise guests  And when I say surprise guests  I mean guests that come in  Not expecting to do the Opie and Anthony show  A lot of radio shows  Do the surprise guest concept  Where the hosts  Are surprised by the guests  That come in  Here on the Opie and Anthony show  We reverse that tradition  The surprise guest 
[03:34:00]  The guest is surprised  To find out what show they're on  Avril Lavigne was here  With Chad Kroger  Her husband  She married the guy from  What  What  Did you pick the most  Like annoying  Avril Lavigne song  You could pop  I picked one we haven't played yet  Oh  Turn it down a little bit  It's very distracting  So she was here  And I guess she was doing  All the music channels  She dropped into Shade 45  For whatever reason 
[03:34:30]  And Hits 1  And all those places  But she stopped in  To the Opie and Anthony show  And I was such an Avril Lavigne fan  Back in the day  I was obsessed with her  Like  I had the biggest crush on her  To the point that  I would actually  Listen to the music  That's how big the crush was  It was like  The way a girl  Has a crush  On a boy band member  Like a girl has such a crush  On whoever it is  Lance Bass  Before she knows  The real deal  That she's listening  To the music 
[03:35:00]  Just cause she has a crush  On this dude  That was me and Avril Lavigne  When I was like 18  I know you're thinking  Sam  At no age  Should that be appropriate  But specifically  Not 18  Well I'm sorry  But that's the truth  And I try to tell you guys  The truth  I was obsessed with her  When she first came out  I was like  When Complicated was first  On the radio  I was like  I don't know  This is stupid  I don't like this type of music  I like White Zombie  And then I was like  You know what  I like the song  And I love that girl  I want to make an honest woman 
[03:35:30]  Out of her  And then she ends up  Marrying the guy  From Sum 41  The two of us get older  We part ways a little bit  I find the woman  Of my dreams  She finds Chad Kroger  And what are we gonna do  But I don't really get  You know  I've been on this show  For like 8 years  And I don't get  Hugely starstruck  When most of the guests  Come on the  Opie and Anthony show  I mean it's always cool  Don't get me wrong  Like I'm always like  Awesome  William Shatner's here again  It's very cool  To see William Shatner 
[03:36:00]  Sitting out in the hallway  Next to Club Soda Kenny  But I don't necessarily  Get that starstruck  Because  What difference does it make  I'm just gonna sit here  At the very best  I'll be made fun of  In their presence  That's the most  That could possibly happen  As far as interactions go  But  And so  And so I fear  To be no different  So  I open the door  For Opie and Anthony  To yell at Avril Lavigne  And tell her to come in  And Avril Lavigne walks in  And I swear to god  I was back to like  Freshman year of college  When I thought 
[03:36:30]  She was awesome  It was pathetic  I got completely starstruck  And I was not expecting it  It was very strange  Almost got shaky  I had to get a photo with her  This is a great album though  I can't say enough about this  Are you an Avril Lavigne fan  E-Rock  I do enjoy the Avril Lavigne  This was  This was probably my foray  Into realizing that  I was going to like things  That weren't masculine  And I was gonna have to be okay with it  Like this was probably 
[03:37:00]  The first time I was like  You know what  I'm kind of into this  Pop music bullshit  I don't wanna be  I'm gonna be made fun of for this  But whatever  Let's go  Full force  That's what I was saying  Earlier on the show  You could see  The photo of  A young me  And Jim Norton  When I met him  For the first time  Up in Syracuse  New York  There's a little  Avril Lavigne t-shirt  Peeking through  The bottom of that photo  It's a very special thing  You were not a  But you were not 
[03:37:30]  A super fan Eric  Not to the level  That you were at  It was very weird  For a short period  Of time in my life  I do enjoy her work  I mean Travis  Was reminded me  When I first started  Like when I was  An intern here  Or whatever  I'd walk into work  With an Avril Lavigne  Sweatshirt on  And you guys would be like  What the fuck are you doing Sam  Why would you wear that  And I was like  I can't help but be honest  About the things  That I appreciate  In this world  And Avril Lavigne  Happens to be one of those things  And then she was looking  All hot on the cover  Of Maxim  Remember when that first 
[03:38:00]  Maxim came out  With Avril on the cover  And she was like  Fake edgy  I had her sign it  You did  Today  Or early  Last time she was here  She was like fake  Kind of like poser edgy  You know what I mean  So it was not  At all scary  Like you kind of felt like  Like I felt like  Oh I could teach her  Something about rock history  And I don't know anything  About rock history  This is around the time  That you know  She was throwing up  Devil horns  And then announcing  The Grammy Awards  As like David Bowie  And saying she didn't know  Who Kurt Cobain was 
[03:38:30]  And all this stuff  And I said  That's adorable  Come under my wing  It was pathetic  But I felt like  It all came full circle today  I felt like I have  A nice amount of closure  On that part of my life now  I can move forward  Do you want to get  That CD signed?  I have it signed  Oh good  The first album?  Yep  I got it signed  Me too  Don't sing along  This song  It just gets weird  When you do it  Like it makes me realize  How weird it is 
[03:39:00]  That I was doing it  Back then  You know how great  This song was?  Yes of course  Weird Al did a cover of it  Weird Al  What was the song?  It's called  A Complicated Song  Was this the same thing  That he did with Nirvana?  Yeah pretty much  It was the exact same deal?  Yeah  Same joke  But he was talking about  How he  It's like three different stories  Throughout the song  Yeah  That he didn't know  That the girl  He was engaged to  Was his cousin or sister  Or something like that  Right  Something about eating pizza 
[03:39:30]  And you know  He works food  Into everything  Of course he does  Because he just wants  Something that will  Appeal to people  It's the same reason  Why the producer  Who did the Friday  YouTube phenomenon song  His new song  Is about Chinese food  Because he's like  What does everybody like?  Food  Friday  Holidays  That's what every song  Has to be about  It has to be easy  It has to be digestible  Those poor girls  Don't realize that  Their lives are being ruined  Yeah I want to talk about  That in a minute 
[03:40:00]  But Matt in Ohio  Sam  Love you  Love the show  Thanks buddy  Hey I just wanted to know  If you imagined  Avril singing  That girlfriend song  To you  That she was singing  It all about you  I didn't  It wasn't the girlfriend song  That E-Rock played  To come back from break  Oh maybe a little bit  Like oh  What if Avril  This was when I was dating  Jess when this song came out  And then this song came out  And it was huge  And it made me think  Well it's okay that I like  Avril Lavigne  Because she's better than  These other pop singers 
[03:40:30]  Because she's still making hits  But there was probably  A little of me  That was like  What if Avril Lavigne shows up  And it's like  See that Jess chick  I don't like her  I want you  And I'd be like  Sorry Jess  Is this when you're fighting  On a miniature golf course?  Yeah exactly  Except I wouldn't be fighting  It'd be Jess and Avril Lavigne  Fighting over me  And my honor  And you're just standing there  Holding the putter  Like I don't know what to do  Right like look  I can't help but be this charming  I'll just go to the concession  While they hash it out  I'm gonna go get some  Nachos and cheese sauce  While Avril Lavigne and Jess 
[03:41:00]  Fight for my honor  I'm just gonna play through  Okay  Is this uh  Are these delusions of grandeur?  Does it go that far?  Nah everyone has these  Good  Good  Just fantasies  Yeah she's just screaming that at me  And I'm like  Alright Avril  If you got a problem with Jess  You gotta take it up with her  You live such a complicated life  That's true  Stu  Hey what's up Sam?  What's up buddy?  Well I was gonna 
[03:41:30]  We're talking a little bit of music  I'm a big headbanger myself  Love zombie  But do you remember  10 years ago  When they had the MTV  Metallica Icon thing  And they had a bunch of bands  Come and cover Metallica songs  And Avril Lavigne  The Avril Lavigne band  Did a cover of Fuel  And I remember it not being  Incredibly technically  Proficiently played  At the time  I don't think it was  That is Korn playing one  And then just not even  And petering out  Right before the guitar solo  Because they sucked too hard  To even cover  To even do Kirk Hammett's solo  Yeah I  I do remember that show 
[03:42:00]  And I remember watching it  Probably for that reason  And I have to tell you  Avril Lavigne  I have a lot of  Artists in my repertoire  That I listen to  Put it on pause for a second  Sure  Because I want to hear that intro too  I have a lot of artists  In my repertoire  That are fairly indefensible  I think Avril Lavigne  Me saying  Yes  I was  And to some degree  Still am  Into Avril Lavigne music  Is the most indefensible statement  I could ever make  Sal  You're a music guy  What do you think of that statement  And I'm not being ironic about it 
[03:42:30]  I'm not trying to shit on you  But  Yeah it's a rough one dude  I love metal  But let me say  We're both 30  And I remember  I was a freshman in college  When she was kind of hot  And I remember that song  Skater Boy  Thinking  Well that's kind of a catchy little tune  That's what I'm saying  Thank God you are alive Stu  Thank God you're in my life  Because I was the same way  Alright  I listened to  I listened to  It was all  You know  White Zombie  Rob Zombie  Overkill  Yeah Metallica  I listened to 
[03:43:00]  All these  Korn  I love Korn  Well Korn  And Korn was pretty shitty  When they first came out  Exactly  When they did that cover of One  They had a real funky bass line on it  That was awesome  And then they petered out  Before the guitar solos  I'm like  What are you doing  It's like having sex without coming  Because that's the song one  Yeah  Five minutes of building  To Hammett's two great solos  And when it gets to  When it Hammett's solos  You're like  Yeah  Fuck yeah  Yeah  And they don't even take the time 
[03:43:30]  To learn the solos  No of course not  It's like  We're too  We're too new metal  To play anything that's good  And that's  And that's like  And Korn  I saw them  When I was 11 years old  I live in Tulsa  They opened for negative  Alright Stu  I gotta let you go buddy  Stu I gotta let you go  I'm hearing the size  I gotta let you go  Alright bye  I don't wanna be rude  I don't wanna be rude to him  Cause he's got my back  But I was just like  Stu okay  The first two Korn albums  That's as far as I'll go with Korn  Awesome dude  Yeah  Is that the one where  It's in the playground  Yes 
[03:44:00]  With the swing  Yeah yeah  First two Korn albums  White Zombie  Rob Zombie  Pantera  Far Beyond Driven  That was all my shit  Okay  I was listening to all that music  And all this thing  That I've become known for  On the Opie and Anthony show  Whether it's Lady Gaga  Whether it's any of this shit  All started  With like this song  With what  With the same thing  That happened with Stu  With me being like  This skater boy thing  She's super cute  She's hot  And look 
[03:44:30]  It's a catchy song  I can't get it out of my head  Well you know what that means  And then the complicated song  Came on  And I was like  You know I wanna meet a girl  That wears a tie  With no collar  That's what I'm really looking for  I want an Ashton Kutcher  Trucker hat on a girl  That's what I really need  In my life  What does that mean Eric  Well if you're saying  Everything that you enjoy now  And people know you for  Not everything  Just that aspect  That aspect of you  Goes back to this song  And to Avril Lavigne  Yes  You need to have her name  Tattooed on your arm  Alright  What would you think Sal  If I showed up with 
[03:45:00]  An Avril Lavigne tattoo  No man  You wouldn't think  That's a good idea  No  You see the Rob Zombie tattoo  I have  Alright cool with that  Jack White tattoo  Absolutely  Avril Lavigne right under it  Get the fuck out of here  With the star  She'll sign like a little star  And everything  No no she gets the other arm  What if I put on the  What if I do a pop music arm  Nah man  You're not okay with it  Nah nah  I'd give you a lot of shit for that  Do you think  Avril Lavigne is  Being like  Yeah Avril Lavigne is  Kind of my shit  Is that the most indefensible  Yeah that's definitely up there 
[03:45:30]  Cause it's like  You look back at it  Like it's nostalgic  But it's not a good song  Even that part  You don't like that part either  Fucking sound effects  I had the poster  I mean a lot of this stuff  Was given to me  Cause people thought  It was funny that I liked her  Yeah yeah yeah  But I kept all of it  You know  I had the album  The poster  The sweatshirt  Fuck that  As I said  I'm not going out  And buying everything  Like my brother  Thought it was funny  That I liked Avril Lavigne  So that Christmas  It was just all  Avril Lavigne shit for me  But 
[03:46:00]  Still yeah  You like the song  Fuel by Metallica  That's one of their best  Latest songs  Yeah  You know  Absolutely  The kind of  Post long hair  Metallica  Yeah  For sure  Yeah  And uh  Yeah  I remember this  This fucking  You remember  You've seen it  Oh yeah  She's so out of tune  In the first line  Well let's take a listen  Let's hear it for Avril Lavigne  Oh Shannon Elizabeth  Pretending to say  Oh man  It was so hard 
[03:46:30]  To defend this poor girl  I don't know why  I kept trying  Like the band's tight as fuck  Yeah they're good  But they're like a  But you do  A touring studio band  Yeah  You're doing female vocals  On fucking  Trying to take  You know  Like 18 year old  Female vocals  Canadian  18 year old  Female vocals  It's not that bad  You guys have to 
[03:47:00]  Like get the fuck  Out of here  Yeah  What  Why did we agree  To this  She's hardcore dude  Yeah  I just wanted to get to the hook  She's not that bad  Nah  She's hitting the notes  Man 
[03:47:30]  I don't know how I feel about this  This is the part that counts  So give me you  Give me four  Give me that  It's time to show  It's that  Look  If that song  If this song came out in 94  And that was Veruca Salt or something  That would be fine  It's not as bad as I remember it now  Yeah  Look at Lars  Is fucking rocking out in the front row  I forgot how fucking good this song is man  I forgot how fucking great this is 
[03:48:00]  Except the drummer sucks up there  I should be up there with her  If all Lars is thinking about the fucking royalties  He's gonna get for them  I hope none of these fuckers are recording this right now  They should buy the fucking album if they want to hear it  They should not show up in Napster  These fucking assholes are the ones who downloaded our shit  For free  Avril Lavigne's badass though  Lars is Canadian 
[03:48:30]  It's all the same  Danish, Canadian, it's the same  It's not that different is it?  Peaceful land  Yeah  Quiet and weird  The Quorum one was good  I know that's a sidetrack  But the Quorum one was fucking good  I will say  As hard as Lars is rocking out right now  And loving this  James Hetfield can't be happy about this selection  This was the Metallica icon show I think  You gotta watch this video 
[03:49:00]  Go on YouTube  And find Avril Lavigne performing fuel  And just watch for Lars being like  Fucking A man  He's just  He's got the horns up  He's headbanging the whole time  He's got his weird like bleach blonde haircut  No  The first three rows is like kind of shaking their head  Everyone else is just still  Kirk is being polite  Yeah  Like okay  He's just a nice guy  Lars is fucking like  Did you guys see Avril Lavigne out there tonight? 
[03:49:30]  We gotta do something with that chick  Whose kid is this?  We gotta do something with that girl  Guys  And James is like  Lars what the fuck are you talking about dude?  This is why we don't get along  It was fucking so good  James is going Lars  That's why we have separate dressing rooms buddy  Does anybody have a copy of her album?  Oh my god  Python  Python  Applause  You know she did Spongebob too right? 
[03:50:00]  For that Spongebob movie  Well that  Is a lot more acceptable  Do you want to hear that?  No  I don't want to hear that  Scott in Virginia  Hey Sam  Yo I want to hear it  I bet it's fucking rad  What's up Scott?  Hey look man  You know  You're spot on this  Look I'm 42  I listen mainly to Jimmy Buffett  And you know  I also like Kiss  Metallica  All the old metal  You know  I grew up in the 80's  But look  She's cute  She's actually talented  I mean it's actually  The lyrics are a decent pop song 
[03:50:30]  I don't even like pop songs  She makes me like music  I wouldn't otherwise like  I think she's awesome  That's what happened to me Scott  I don't know what happens to guys like us  But that's what happened to me  I'll tell you what you've got to look into man  Do you remember Nina?  She did 99 Look Balloons  Yes okay  I remember 99 Look Balloons  Okay  After disappearing from the US  She went on  She is like the biggest superstar in Germany  Okay look  Scott  I thought  I thought this was going to be like a good call 
[03:51:00]  To get my point across  But then you're coming at me with 99  You know what else is good?  99 Loft Balloons  You and Lars would get along like great  Fuck out of here  I'll give it a chance  Thank you Scott  I have to admit though  I just did the math  She was 19  She was 19 dude  At doing that  And that's kind of ridiculous  She wasn't that bad  No  If she wasn't Avril Lavigne  At that time  It wouldn't have been looked at as so horrific  Right  You know what I mean?  Like a lot of it is sort of the 
[03:51:30]  Pretending to be hardcore  You know  Bullshit Canadian punk rock poser stuff  That was attached to it  You know  If you just look  If you said that that was whatever  Four non-blondes singing that song  You'd be like  Okay cool  I'd be like  Okay yeah  I'm down with that  I used to love that song when I was a kid  Of course you did  You know what she does now?  The lead singer of four non-blondes  No  She writes like every  Pop hit  Like her and Dr. Luke  Are just doing every  Like every pink song  What's her name?  Lori Petty? 
[03:52:00]  No that would be the girl  Who starred in Tank Girl  Linda Perry  Linda Perry  Lori Petty is  Kit from  A League of Their Own  Wow  Yeah she wrote like  Every pink song  All those songs  Are Linda Perry songs  Christina Aguilera  Gwen Stefani  Yeah  Wow  I don't know dude  Make fun of that band  All you want  Four non-blondes  I got the one hit  All right  That was decent  Is Nikki in there?  No she's getting something  Getting what?  She ran out  She'll be right back 
[03:52:30]  What'd she run out for?  Dropped something off  Come on  It's probably  Is it your bullshit?  Is that what you want to tell me?  No  I just had her put stuff in the back  Oh  She's not out of the building  No she's right here  You just said she went to drop something off  She just walked in the  Oh I thought that was her  Never mind  Who is it?  You are so confused in there  It's her  It is her  Paranoid E-Rock  Yeah  I'm looking at you  And I see it go past the side  She's driving something off  She's right here  Why are you asking so many questions?  She's here  Is she doing the phones  Or somebody else?  She's doing the phones  Put her on the microphone  For a second  Nikki  Nikki 
[03:53:00]  You here?  Yeah  How old are you?  I forgot  22  Okay  Nikki is a cute 22 year old girl  I have to ask you  A guy comes up to you  We did this about the toy thing  And you were dead wrong  Guy comes up to you  He's in his late 20's  Maybe just snuck out of his late 20's  And says  Look I gotta tell you something  I'm a big fan of Avril Lavigne  What do you say?  I would have no problem with that  Thank you Nikki  Beautiful  Beautiful  Now get back to phones 
[03:53:30]  Stop being so lazy  Nikki did tell me  One of our top five bands of all time  Nikki what was it?  Okay Nikki  Get back to the microphone  I couldn't agree with it  This is probably  I keep not asking follow up questions  And that could  Nikki what are your  Top five favorite bands of all time?  I didn't come up with top five  I can't put a top three right now  Okay who are your top three  Favorite bands ever?  This is like of all time  All time  Okay so the Beatles  Okay that's great  See Beatles  Avril Lavigne  Perfect  Okay  Journey  Okay that's  We're getting a little shaky  But okay  There's a drop off 
[03:54:00]  And I love Matchbox 20  Jesus Christ  Oh man  My argument just has no  Clout  I just couldn't  I couldn't agree with that  Matchbox 20  How could a 22 year old  Like Matchbox 20 at all?  Let alone  Is Matchbox 20 still doing music?  They do  They do a lot of those  Where they group a bunch of  90s bands together  And play festivals  They've had a few hiatuses  Is that Rob Thomas' band?  Yeah  I don't want to play  Matchbox 20 songs  I gotta be honest with you  You're gonna have to turn that down 
[03:54:30]  I don't want to hear it  I don't want to hear it  Yeah no  I don't want to hear Matchbox 20  I understand that Nikki has taste  That maybe we don't all share  But this is not after  Open Anthony Live with Nikki  It's after Open Anthony Live with Sam Roberts  That was a very linear list  Beatles  Journey  Matchbox 20  Oof  Yeah it was really  Why don't you find out who the other two were?  Bloodhound Gang  There was  Nice  And then  What would be the fifth?  There was no doubt  About who's first, second, and third in that list  Bring Nikki over here 
[03:55:00]  Hold on  Come here  They want to talk to you again  Coming  Oh  Are you an Avril Lavigne fan, Nikki?  Yeah  Okay, you like her  What's your favorite song?  I don't really have a favorite song  I don't  I like her  I'm not like a super fan  You celebrate her entire catalog  What?  Okay  What?  I have to ask you  What is a 22 year old girl doing  With Matchbox 20 as her favorite band?  Cause I  I don't know  Are they still putting out music?  Yeah  They are?  Yeah  What's like the last good Matchbox 20 song? 
[03:55:30]  Well they haven't had a really good song  I say baby  It's 3am  I must be lonely  That's the only one  Isn't it?  That's older  That's what I thought  They have some new stuff though  That they just put out  Is it good?  Yeah  Like  Almost as good as the Beatles  But not quite  No  Nothing compared to the Beatles  Well yeah  But I mean  Only two places behind  No  No  On my list  It's like top  Not like a full time  Whatever  You said  Matchbox 20 was the number three band of all time  Behind  The Beatles and Journey 
[03:56:00]  On my list  It's different  But I'd like the Beatles  I guess  Who else would be on that list then?  I don't  Can't figure out the next two  It's just like  It kind of starts and stops with those three  Paul McCartney  Steve Perry  Rob Thomas  Rob Thomas  Right  Or are you more a Lennon guy?  No  I'm Paul  You're McCartney  Yeah  So it's McCartney  Perry  Thomas  That's  The trifecta  You guys are abusing me  So like  His voice is amazing  So like if you got tattoos on your arm of your favorite musician 
[03:56:30]  Like for me  I have Rob Zombie's autograph tattooed on my arm  I have Jack White's tattooed on my arm  I would add Jay-Z on my arm  But it's like those three  I feel like  Nobody's gonna  People might kill me for all three  But nobody's gonna kill me for one  And not the other two  You  Nikki  Would go ahead  And get  McCartney  Steve Perry  And Rob Thomas  Tattooed  Would you get a Rob Thomas autograph tattooed on your arm?  Probably not  Probably not  But that's because you don't do tattoos  I do have tattoos  What do you have tattoos of? 
[03:57:00]  Music notes  Stars  What do the music notes sound like?  I don't know  They're just music notes?  I'm just music notes  What happens if they play something horrific?
