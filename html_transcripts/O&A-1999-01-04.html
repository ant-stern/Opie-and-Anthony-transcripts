<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts celebrating their continued employment despite listener bets on their imminent firing. Opie recounted a horrific flight from Florida, marked by severe turbulence and widespread vomiting, followed by a chaotic journey home involving a bus and train after a family transportation snafu.  Anthony detailed his holiday experiences, including a lengthy, contentious blackjack session in Atlantic City where he clashed with other players and met a listener, Cory from Staten Island. Both hosts shared anecdotes about the awkwardness of obligatory family holiday kissing.

The show then delved into their "Top 99 Albums of 1999" list, engaging in playful debate and mockery of their own subjective rankings. They briefly, and critically, reviewed New Year's Eve television specials, lambasting the performances and commenting on Dick Clark's aging appearance, particularly criticizing Jesse Ventura's incoherent appearance on MTV's New Year's Eve broadcast, along with Jennifer Love Hewitt's participation.  A segment followed detailing bizarre and tragic 1998 deaths, including a man killed by a pipe on the Long Island Expressway, a Disney boat cleat fatality, a paraplegic who froze to death, and a man who fell down an elevator shaft. A listener called in to contribute another unusual death story.

After advertising Priceline.com and discussing Jesse Ventura's gubernatorial inauguration audio, the conversation shifted to professional wrestling, criticizing its increasingly sexual and violent content.  A listener's potentially offensive fax was mentioned but not read. The NBA lockout was discussed, with Opie expressing his frustration. The death of Jerry Quarry from dementia pugilistica was mentioned, drawing a parallel to the potential health risks in professional wrestling.  The show concluded with a discussion of the graphic and disturbing film "The Dentist," and a humorous exchange about *The Flintstones*.

A subsequent segment began with a nonsensical discussion about a previous broadcast interruption.  The hosts reviewed the weekend's top five movies:  *Prince of Egypt* (deemed "stupid"), *You've Got Mail* (compared to *Sleepless in Seattle*), *Stepmom* (featuring a Scott Muni cameo), and *Patch Adams* (criticized as terrible despite its box office success).  A substantial portion of the segment involved a vulgar and critical analysis of Robin Williams' comedic style, focusing on his perceived lack of substance and reliance on improvisation and audience reaction. They reminisced about his earlier work and a *Happy Days* episode featuring Fonzie, discussing the show's evolution and Jenny Piccolo's surprising appearance.  The conversation digressed into observations about crossing the street and the absurdities of Robin Williams' stage presence.  Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy were briefly mentioned before returning to Robin Williams' comedic techniques and his use of a beard. The segment concluded with a recap of news stories (a woman rescued from her apartment, a 60-car pile-up, and the declining popularity of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve), a promotion for the Tuesday Night Armor Club, and further off-hand comments about Dick Clarkâ€™s age and appearance. No in-studio guests were mentioned in this segment.

[00:00:00]  one oh two seven wnaw the rock of new york you too sweetest thing i'm falling in love  hey what's up what's up it's opie it's anthony we're back live on your damn radio and if you  had the um opie and anthony are fired before the first of the year bet you have lost we are still  here squeaked in under the wire that's funny because i was reading a lot of email and uh a  bunch of people made all sorts of bet about our firing they were convinced we wouldn't make it 
[00:00:30]  to the end of the year and here we are in 1999 had many of those faxes you guys won't be here by the  end of the year well okay thank you thanks for the support we appreciate still here yes kiss our  collective ass that's right all right man i feel very rested are you well you had a nice little  away vacation thing yeah i did something away i went to florida for a while got away it was so funny to  be in florida yeah florida was the only part in the entire country that had nice weather i lucked 
[00:01:00]  out for one you did everything else was frozen and raining and snow yeah because i'm watching the  news down there it's just ice storms here and blizzards here and it's terrible but you know what  in the end i got it handed to me though i had to fly back in that rain yesterday morning  pretty nasty oh worst plane flight ever ever you you don't fly very well anyway to begin with no i  don't but um we're heading toward the airport and it's a it's a bit bumpy right and i was thinking 
[00:01:30]  about you laughing because the you know the pilot gets on the intercom yeah all calm and collective  and said uh we're gonna be in a holding pattern for the next uh 30 minutes yeah we're gonna hold  this uh course for a little while a little stacked up because of the weather a little buffeting  please keep your seatbelt fastened meanwhile you're bouncing off the wall uh it was it was  horrendous yeah it was like it was like being on a roller coaster for a half hour with some serious  bumps and it was hot dude it was horrible any woofage out of the upstairs well we're gonna get to that 
[00:02:00]  point i didn't woof oh you didn't sandy woofed sandy sandy woofed so oh no so we're in the holding  pattern for about 20 minutes and they finally said good news we're gonna be uh heading toward the  airport now sorry for the bumpy ride blah blah blah we get about 10 15 miles closer and we get in  another holding pattern this holding pattern was brutal i thought we were getting shot at  i thought the plane was getting shot at the aircraft from newark oh yeah and the plane is banking and 
[00:02:30]  dropping and lifting back up it was horrendous and the pilot comes on for the second time and  completely apologizes for the bumpy ride saying there's nothing we could do we're in the middle of  storm can't go higher can't go lower everybody's stacked up we just gotta hold on tight he says  hold on tight and let's and let's deal with it okay was it like a william shatner twilight zone yeah  there's a man on the wing the man on the wing so we deal with that holding pattern for another 20  minutes the pilot comes on for the third time not exaggerating you could tell by his voice that he was 
[00:03:00]  having a tough time not puking himself get out of the cockpit he just sounded horrible maybe it was  a little busy so sandy's sitting right next to me she all sudden looks at me and goes get the bag  what the overhead what the luggage what what bag no at this point i i knew she needed a few so when  someone says get the bag and you're in the middle of a flight like this i was like a retarded kid  trying to like reach for a block i couldn't find the damn bag fast enough i'm panicking you know 
[00:03:30]  and she's like it's coming up oh yeah so i handed to her and she she fills up the bag it gets to the  point where here's this cute innocent girl little little sandy little sandy puking people are turning  around because now the smell is just everywhere starts off that chain reaction right sometimes  yeah you want to wait for that and but uh in all fairness to her she wasn't the only one that puked  because they made an announcement when we landed if you did puke uh on our descent please seal the 
[00:04:00]  bags real tight and put it under your seat ah so we were in like the last row and i was just counting  bags as i was uh exiting the aircraft and i was up to 12 as i left the airplane just put it in the  island step on it clean that up all right so then i get off the plane the story doesn't end there  you know you know how it was raining yesterday morning it was horrendous a little bit of rain yeah  so uh i assumed someone was picking me up at the airport oh there's a little uh miscommunication 
[00:04:30]  among my family members so i'm sitting in newark going all right it's obvious that i got to figure  out how to get home from here so then we had to jump on a bus to penn station and jump on a train  then a cab so the whole relaxing thing from the vacation was spent when you got back yeah pretty much so  i i gotta warn people that i'm still feeling a little nauseous from the the flight yesterday  yeah he was a pain in the ass to drive in of course i had to drive in today we did the car pull thing

[00:24:30]  definitely appreciate it as we're back from vacation this is our live voices not that uh yeah worst of  stuff that we put together for you for last week tape stuff yes i don't like that and so many  exciting things have happened in the last few days alone yes opie yes  well the the big weather story i think that was pretty uh well we had the rain yeah the rain storm  we had a 60 car pile up on the grand central parkway saturday night you know it was one guy doing 
[00:25:00]  something very stupid yeah when now that happened that started that oh really you don't think maybe  somebody was in the left lane doing 10 and then uh other people came up behind him and just jam on  the brakes yeah that could have been it that could have been it maybe somebody uh i don't know stopping  at the uh in the right lane as they're ready to get off the exit yeah maybe something like that  60 car pile up though that's pretty good that's a good one and you usually get those in the midwest 
[00:25:30]  because of fog and stuff but not in the grand central oh that's good and then you had the uh  well i mean just a tragic story of the lady that got pushed in front of the subway oh you know what  are you crazy you stand with your back against the wall we were talking about this before the show today  i either uh stand behind a pilot or i stand with my back against the wall i don't trust anyone out  there get what why do you have to walk up to the edge of the platform and lean over and look to see 
[00:26:00]  if the train's coming yeah if it's coming you'll know it yes you'll hear it and then you'll see it  you see it every time though and even with this story hitting the news and the papers and stuff  when you go home tonight and you're on a subway platform watch there's someone out there uh leaning  over right up at the edge leaning over you know how easy it is for like to like this some kook  some kooky guy just decides he's going to shove this girl underneath uh a train did you hear what  he said when they they got him what it was her time her time it was her time anthony according to him 
[00:26:30]  i think she probably had a different idea they should throw him in front of a train but of course  no there'll be a long trial no some scumbag lawyer out there will represent this guy he's a sick sick man  who needs help he needs our help he can't be punished for a crime like that he didn't know  what he was doing of course not and then they'll uh let him out you know they'll they'll give him  some medication see he might not have been on his medication what about that another story the girl 
[00:27:00]  that got pushed in front of the train in 79 i think it was she was going to be a uh flute player or  something yeah 79 the hand of renee cat simon a flute playing senior at the high school for music  and arts is severed when she is pushed on the train tracks yeah how about this police arrested uh alan  lewis back then a cbs mail clerk uh-oh oh no is he still working here he probably still has a job  at cbs uh because they don't fire anyone in this place but the case fell apart before a manhattan uh jury 
[00:27:30]  which feared the confession was coerced yeah and let this guy go so this guy got off scot-free for  pushing this girl under uh under a train oh yeah so that why should it be any different maybe this  guy it's no real big deal you don't really need two hands to play the flute anyway no no not really  that's good the cbs mail clerk his life his life goes on and hers goes on too no she could continue  playing no problem there and then you got the lady who almost drowned in her apartment 
[00:28:00]  that's pretty wild huh the water was was coming in so fast through a kitchen window  that it was just filling up she was asleep in her bed with earplugs in so she couldn't hear  and she woke up and she's like floating on her bed isn't this like a bugs buddy yeah remember when  he went to the castle with the guy that wanted his brain all i need is a brain i'll get you rabbit 
[00:28:30]  rabbit yeah he's floating down there and because he floated right out of his hole yeah that's what  happened she should have just stayed on the mattress she would have been all right floated right out to  the doctor's castle nighty night rabbit yeah and then the water was pushing against her door so  much she couldn't get out and open the door what a way to go that is mental so it's filling up she's  in like one of these crime ridden uh neighborhoods she thinks you know she's finally safe from the

[00:41:30]  domination are going crazy in wrestling if you've watched the wwf wrestling lately the guy's right  it's insane i saw nip i saw these two girls were wrestling one day on their monday night show which i  believe is live and her boob came out this one uh black girl and just a big boob hanging and they 
[00:42:00]  weren't even trying to cover it up it's just out there and all the wrestlers now flip the bird at  each other yeah and and you could just see him and barely hear him using the f word like f you and and  you know ass this it's it's out of control i miss the old days of wrestling with bruno sammartino and  chief j strongbow and chief j strong at the time like chief j strongbow was uh tag teaming with  bruno and out of nowhere he hits bruno over the head with a chair oh my god but wait they were 
[00:42:30]  partners they were partners like oh what happened now wait chief j strong was a good guy and now he's  a bad guy as an 11 year old kid i couldn't really figure it out man what the heck's going on here they  don't really have good guys and bad guys one guy comes out the godfather and he's a pimp  and he brings out hoes he goes you like my hoes i mean and it's just the black community should be  outraged by this guy he's some black guy wearing this pimp hat and he's like would you all like some  of my hoes i got me some fine hoes here today and it's like a nightly event this guy does this and he 
[00:43:00]  brings these scantily clared uh uh chicks up there and he gives them away to people his hoes his hoes yeah  so this person has a little problem with that very good i don't have a problem with it i just  you know i just want to see people beat each other up in the head oh wow we got another uh um email or  actually a fax from uh are we allowed to say it this time uh oh no i wouldn't i wouldn't all right  i'll read this uh i'll read this it's a good nice organization right well well let me all right stall for

[00:45:00]  most of the uh things that uh you've been reading in the papers today yeah uh nba uh pretty much  calling off the season thursday you know no no do you want to talk about basketball anthony that's  really a drag i'll think maybe someone who knows basketball could come into the studio and discuss  this with me someone that cares about basketball i'll take a breather i'm crushed i want an nba season and  if they don't have an nba season i will not be i will not be a fan for many years you're going to  be a puppet one of those stupid people that tune in when when they get their season back well please 
[00:45:30]  see what what's got to happen is us the fans we rally the troops we gotta rally the get them together  but it doesn't happen because there's always someone out there as soon as the season comes back  they go rush into uh the garden or the stadium yeah they ruin it for everyone that's it we gotta show  the players and the owners we mean business but every time this happens we go running back you're 
[00:46:00]  rallying the truth do you realize in 1994 as we all know they canceled canceled the world series yeah now  four years later everyone uh has forgotten it woo mark mcguire woo yeah that's all it takes so when  they cancel the nba season thursday most likely a lot of people think they're gonna figure something  out at the last minute they better because it's just gonna completely wreck the sport they're gonna 
[00:46:30]  have to come up with some uh some new wacky thing next year like a slam from your butt some player will  put the ball in his butt and slam it that way so everyone will go oh i gotta see the butt slam we  gotta go to the game but we're as fans we're pathetic we are pathetic let's say they cancel  the nba season but they figure it out and there's a there's a season next year the garden will be sold  out and not only will the garden be sold out ticket prices will go up of course and we just sit there 
[00:47:00]  like a bunch of lemmings and go okay they're playing again let's go back and watch them it amazes me how  we think in this country you stay away and uh i will make your point no i will stay away and uh for the  first time in four years i'll admit i was starting to get into baseball but i still have a bitter taste  in my mouth over baseball and and and if the season is canceled with the basketball i cannot be a fan  anymore cannot wow they're millionaires arguing over money yeah yeah we can yeah yeah and us the 
[00:47:30]  fans could relate to that as they raise our prices again next year yeah because that's all happened  the owners aren't gonna have to go into their pocket no just raise the prices they'll figure something  out so we got that pending this week well opie it could be worse huh you could be jerry quarry  this is a very tragic story jerry quarry died 53 years old yeah the human punching bag  he was a boxer back in the uh 60s and 70s we all know who jerry quarry is right not everybody really 
[00:48:00]  might have to i grew up watching him get beat up i mean no yeah he was the white guy that used to just  get pummeled the white guy that would get his nose broken every time and bleed to death he would  bleed like crazy didn't ali have a line something like uh jerry quarry will get cut at the weigh-in yeah  like he couldn't even make it through a weigh-in without getting cut jerry quarry will get cut at 
[00:48:30]  the weigh-in yeah and and yeah he used to get cut on his eyebrows and stuff and get head butted and just  blood pouring out yeah and um he wound up getting dementia pugilistica  uh opie that sounds like something i don't want that is uh severe brain damage caused by repeated  blows to the head wow look what clinton has to look forward to  sorry sorry i got that dementia pugilistica sorry that was like a slow pitch softball coming right at 
[00:49:00]  me i had to hit that one over the fence yeah by the age of 50 the pounding had taken uh he'd taken in  the ring turned him into a confused childlike man well they did a um they did a special injury  quarry a couple years back and they showed what his life consisted of yeah where his uh grown brothers  and sisters had to take care of him he acted like he was eight years old oh i mean he he was horrible  let's see the boxing had made him age 30 years and he was in the third stage dementia similar to 
[00:49:30]  alzheimer's and noah sad oh he he had this in the early 90s in 1992 he decided to try to make a  comeback in boxing oh because of george foreman and larry holmes and the rest of them he got that  ass kicked out of him by like a club fighter but his family and friends allowed him to get in the ring  one last time in 1992 oh very proud of him so there you have it jerry bye bye bye jerry godspeed jerry dead

[00:55:30]  it was already in the road and another car popped it up in the air yeah but it had to fall off the  truck at some eventually right trucker never knew it just driving home just driving home didn't know  that he just killed the famous director yeah he just goes home hey honey i'm home he put a pipe  through someone's head it amazes me driving the lie every day that uh these truckers they just don't  care what falls out the back of their truck i am getting boulders flipped off of my windshield  from these uh the big dump trucks yeah do they wipe the back of that thing off or just wait till 
[00:56:00]  it falls at 55 60 miles an hour because all rocks don't bounce very high when they fall off those  trucks at 60. but they don't care because then you get hit and then you get a ding in your windshield  and now you're pissed and you you drive up to them start cursing them and beeping and stuff and they  they're they're there behind their steering wheel like what what's going on yeah why are you  beeping at me what you know why what did i do wrong i like the garbage truck the dumpsters 
[00:56:30]  the big dumpsters full of garbage that's just flying out the back like a couple of miles behind  the truck you start seeing signs of the truck like there's papers maybe a few and then the closer you  get the more debris is flying at you yeah it's the sanford and son truck yeah as you're trying to drive  to work great get behind it get furnaces are falling off of the thing debris falling so uh  yeah we got on the subject uh strangest death of 1998 we had the director on the lia uh anthony
