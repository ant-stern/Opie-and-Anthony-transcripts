<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre segment imagining a conversation with the deceased James Gandolfini, filled with surreal humor about the afterlife and a script about Carmela Soprano coping with Tony's death.  A caller then pretended to be Gandolfini calling from beyond the grave, a prank quickly interrupted by others grabbing the phone.  This transitioned into a brief discussion of the hosts' lives and a comedian's upcoming tour dates.

E-Rock then hosted a "Worst of 2013" segment, dominated by Jim Norton's character Chip Chipperson's rambling, offensive, and nonsensical entertainment report. Chip's report included inappropriate jokes, inaccurate celebrity news, and lengthy tangents about his fictional podcast and a desired appearance on the David Letterman show.  This segment was heavily punctuated with offensive language.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a man with an extremely enlarged scrotum, followed by a brief phone call with Dr. Steve for medical consultation.  This was followed by an interview with James Lipton, host of *Inside the Actors Studio*.  Lipton discussed the show's origins, shared candid anecdotes about his celebrity interviews, including Jack Lemmon's first public admission of alcoholism. He also recounted his unusual experience working as a "mech" (male escort) in 1950s Paris, a story corroborated by a playwright's memoir. Lipton further discussed his opinions of various actors, acting techniques, and his time as a university dean.  The segment also included playful mockery of Jim Norton regarding a hypothetical drunk appearance at work, and Norton pitching a superhero concept called "Grocery Man."  Jim Norton, along with Colin Quinn and Tom Papa (present for a segment discussing Trace Adkins's *Celebrity Apprentice* appearance) were in studio during this portion.

Trace Adkins was then interviewed, discussing his career as a roughneck, his transition to country music, a shooting incident with his wife, and his participation in *Celebrity Apprentice*. He also detailed his conservative political views and described his extensive gun collection.  Guy Fieri joined the conversation, discussing his career, new album, and a book, and recounting a story about unintentionally smuggling beer across the Canadian border. Colin Quinn also participated, contributing humor and opinions.  Adkins' maple macadamia ice cream for the Red Cross was also discussed.  The segment included further discussions about guns, gun laws, and numerous anecdotes. A brief mention was made of a past interview with Courtney Love and Jim Florentine.

Courtney Love was interviewed next, primarily focusing on a legal dispute with the Experience Music Project (EMP) and Kurt Cobain's estate over mishandled and potentially stolen belongings.  The conversation included tangents about Cobain's ashes and disputes with Howard Schultz.  Bob Kelly also contributed numerous anecdotes, including a sexual encounter with a dental assistant and her mother.  The conversation further delved into Lewis's struggles with substance abuse, specifically marijuana and cocaine, along with the price and availability of cocaine, culminating in an anecdote about Lewis losing a girlfriend in a hiking accident.  The segment featured numerous advertisements for weight loss and pain relief products.

The show concluded with a caller recounting the tragic death of his girlfriend in a hiking accident. The discussion covered the details of the accident, the caller's grief, and insensitive remarks from some participants. This segued into unrelated discussions about the caller’s Sears credit card, one host’s upcoming podcast, radio personality Sam Roberts, and a suspension resulting from a conflict. The hosts ultimately offered sympathy to the caller.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's not like you're boarding a cosmic train.  Fucking Ambien.  Well, did you see the light?  People talk about the light.  People talk about the light, don't they?  I saw AJ, I saw Meadow, I saw Carmela.  I saw him young, and then as I started to ascend further up into the sky,  they started to get older.  And then I saw babies. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't recognize them.  It's really weird.  And then it's like that night at Holston's, when everything went black.  Hey, shoot, get offini.  I don't want to fucking be dead.  I want to watch my little girl grow up.  This sucks.  Jesus.  Not to mention all the food I'm going to miss.  The food and the beverages and the lifestyle. 
[00:01:00]  I got very comfortable.  I got a lot of respect.  But I was tortured.  Come on.  You gotta be pretty fucked up to play a part like that.  Tony Soprano.  At least you'll see Christopher when you're there.  Fucking A.T., welcome.  Get your fucking ass up here right fucking now.  And let's go for a fucking ride. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah?  I'm going to miss him.  What about AJ?  I mean, you think AJ's going to be all right with your passing there, Tony?  I don't know.  I'm going to be fine.  I want money.  I want money.  I've been saying that all day.  Just walking around my house.  I want money.  The eyes really wide.  I'm going to be fine.  It's not fair.  I knew he would die eventually, but not like this. 
[00:02:00]  So now what?  I don't want to lose my bedroom.  Oh, my God.  Well, I did write a script a couple weeks ago, which is really eerily about this.  So it makes it even more compounded now that it's all gone down.  What was the script about?  It's basically Carmela telling T he's got to go because he's dead.  That he's got to let go because he goes to the fridge and there's nothing in there for him. 
[00:02:30]  He doesn't understand.  Oh, what the fuck?  You've got to keep the meats on tap.  What's with the fucking yogurt?  I don't want to go.  Yeah.  She says, you've got to go.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I live here.  She's like, no, you don't.  You don't live here anymore. 
[00:03:00]  You've got to go.  Where am I going?  What am I doing?  I'm fine.  I can take care of everything.  I've got it covered here.  I've made changes in life.  I can do it.  But you need to get out of here.  Okay.  What if I'm scared?  Well, it's going to be okay.  You're not going to go to hell.  I'm not going to tell the whole thing, but it's that.  Oh, wow.  We was on the phone.  It's amazing. 
[00:03:30]  It sounds amazingly like I'm very, very creepy now.  It is creepy.  Now it's creepy.  What's even creepier is that we get a call from Gandolfini from the afterlife, and some  ass keeps showing up and taking the phone from him.  James, James, James, okay, you've got to go.  Max, they don't want to hear you.  They want to hear me.  I know.  I know they do.  But you're very upset. 
[00:04:00]  And you're on Ambien.  No, you're on Ambien.  Now you're going to go listen to his skin sound talk.  Jesus Christ.  Again, creepy.  You need to work on the Carmella voice.  Anyway.  Fellas, I've got to say, you do a good job over there.  I just hope everyone's getting along.  I hope those serious bathrooms are clean enough for you.  I hope at night you're going out, and you're having some beverages, and you go home to your  families, because that's all it's about. 
[00:04:30]  It's also about watching horror movies.  What?  Horror movies?  Horror movies are good.  Jesus Christ.  I like watching horror movies, because everyone's a fucking asshole in a horror movie.  You can cathodically watch them all fucking die in horrible, violent ways.  So by the end, you're tired, you've seen a lot of death, a lot of blood, and you feel pretty good.  Max, thank you, brother. 
[00:05:00]  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  A salute.  All right.  A salute.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.

That is me.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  Hosting the Worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:10:00]  We're looking back at this past year for all the cool things that happened.  All the great guests that were in studio.  All the amazing and bizarre scenarios that this show has gone through.  This is Chip.  By this point now, I'm sure you all know who Chip Chipperson is.  He's a character of Jim Norton's.  And he has this ability to interject himself into almost every conversation that's being discussed. 
[00:10:30]  And not really contributing in the way that we had hoped.  A lot of you have been asking,  Oh, play the time that Chip said this.  Or the time that Chip did that.  Well, you asked for it.  And now your hell is about to begin.  As we look through a montage.  That's a callback there for you.  A montage of Chip segments.  Chip Chipperson is on the scene.  Oh, by the way, if Justin is listening, I think you should put in a word that Chip Chipperson should make a guest appearance on the David Letterman program. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  I think Dave should not be made aware of who Chip is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Justin Stangler should be the guy to put in the word.  I think what you should do is you should go to Dave and you should go,  Look, Dave and all the things that...  Trust me.  This guy is the good.  He should use his entire relationship he's built up with Dave from...  And his brother.  ...until now.  Put his reputation on the line to vouch for Chip Chipperson. 
[00:11:30]  And his brother.  Oh, and his brother.  Yeah.  I'll just go right out there and go,  Like, hey, it's me.  What's up, Dave?  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest, Chip Chipperson.  And would it be a stand-up thing or just straight to the couch?  I don't know.  I'll just tell him when I get there what I feel like doing.  Oh, you wouldn't?  I'll be like, you better have your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  I'm going to open like that.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm going to sit right down next to him.  I'm going to sit down and go like, what's up, Dave?  He'll go, what are you doing, Chipper? 
[00:12:00]  And I'll go, I hope you got your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  And the audience will go, whoo!  The crowd will go nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We don't know what's going to happen.  This guy's crazy.  What would he interview you about?  Whatever he wanted.  How you doing, Chip?  Fucking good, Dave.  Meeting chicks.  Okay, why do you think America would be interested in seeing Chip Chipperson?  Just because they want to laugh and feel good.  There's nothing to talk to you about, though.  Yes, there is.  Just a boring, stupid man. 
[00:12:30]  He'd be like, how's things going?  I'd be like, if it was any better, I'd be embarrassed.  That is pretty funny.  You just try to have one-liners lined up for every question.  Yeah.  How am I doing?  How are you doing?  Now Jay's leaving.  What's up?  What are you going to have, like, this show on a Tonight Show?  You want to just call it, like, the Dave Letterman Tonight Tomorrow show or something, you know,  and a place could clap for me.  Do they?  Yeah.  Never clap for that one.  No, no, I don't think they're clapping for that. 
[00:13:00]  I'd say, hey, you're the only guy whose name isn't Jimmy now.  You got Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel.  What's this, like a Jimmy conspiracy or something?  And the crowd goes wild again.  Cheer and clap like motherfuckers.  And you'd make reference to them as being such, right?  I'd say motherfuckers.  I'd be like, yeah, you guys know what's up.  CIA.  Chip in action.  Chip in action.  Chip in action.  300 episodes, all written.  I'm going to show four new ones every Thursday. 
[00:13:30]  You ready for the entertainment report?  That's terrible.  We're going to show Entertainment Weekly a thing or two, right?  Oh.  Yeah.  Each episode's two and a half hours.  No commercials.  Four a day?  Fuck, yeah.  Four every week on Thursday.  Thursday.  Starting 7 a.m.  It's 10 hours.  Oh, okay.  You went with this.  I mean, that's Entertainment Tonight.  Tonight.  That's fine.  All right.  It's just entertainment, music, shit. 
[00:14:00]  What's the story?  I'll just riff.  Star of the office, John Krasinski, is to have a cameo on the new season of Arrested Development.  So I hear.  It's a talk show.  It's not just, you know, headlines.  Yeah, it's going to be a talk show.  Actually, expand on that.  Catherine Zeta-Johns is back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  She previously sought treatment in 2011.  Our spies are telling us. 
[00:14:30]  That's a full-form talk show.  You've got to expand on the topic.  Discuss.  ABC has greenlit, what, Greenwood Envy?  A new reality show called Sing Your Face Off, in which each week five celebrities will be  transforming to legendary singers and performs them according to sources who chose to be silent.  That's a rip-off of my show, anyway. 
[00:15:00]  I wrote that show.  I wrote a show.  It was called Dance Your Cunt Off, and I was putting it on the YouTubes.  Dance Your Cunt Off.  And I was showing footage of people who was doing all kinds of crazy dances, and then someone said,  Chipper, they have epilepsy.  Ronnie from the road, Ronnie from the Jersey Shore is in the hospital with kidney stones. 
[00:15:30]  Ow.  Too bad he didn't eat Roland.  Then he would have had Roland stones.  Good one.  I kind of like that.  It's a little clever for Chip.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  This is easy.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Fucking Ronnie from Jersey Shore.  I wonder how he got that.  Probably from all the sand or something in his pizza.  See, you can put a little humor in.  Lighten up the hard news.  Very little.  That one was not clever for Chip. 
[00:16:00]  The three surviving monkeys will be going on tour together this summer.  Where's the fourth one?  What, did he fucking fall out of a tree or something?  I don't know.  No.  He died.  He's dead.  He's Davy Jones.  He passed away.  What happened to him?  He passed away.  How are they going to do some of the Davy Jones songs?  Wasn't that good?  Yeah.  You had a few hits.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  My mother loved the monkeys. 
[00:16:30]  And, uh...  I get it.  With two and a half men returns this season, Angus T. Jones will be only back as a recurring  wall at most.  Uh, who is that?  He's the stake.  Angus T. Jones.  He's the kid.  Guitarist for ACDC.  He's the kid that found Gward.  He had a problem with the show.  Yeah.  He found Gward.  Instead of two and a half men, they're going to have to call two men and that fucking guy 
[00:17:00]  who you see once in a while or something.  I don't know.  Change the name.  You got me.  You should, Chip.  That's good.  Yeah, well, I know.  Entertainment's easy.  Hey, the guy's going to be on Arrested Development from the office to Arrested Development.  I don't give a fuck.  Well, you got to make believe you can think that works.  Big fucking deal.  No, you got to kind of...  Hey, that crazy girl married to Michael Jones, whatever his name is.  Michael Jones.  Michael Douglas.  She's in a hospital because she got bipolar.  How come she didn't steal it?  Oh.  Double disorders, cocksucker. 
[00:17:30]  Well, this is working.  I kind of like it.  I listen to this more.  Fuck yeah.  Before I'd listen to Entertainment Weekly Radio.  Yeah.  She's as nutty as a fruitcake, my mother would say.  That's...  Oh, the pretty ones are always crazy, Chipper.  Get yourself a nice lady with ham hock ankles.  You want a lady who can carry the sofa up the stairs by herself.  That's practical.  Lamar always said that my mother had a lot of cushion. 
[00:18:00]  What?  Lamar.  Hmm.  Is she fucking her?  No.  Bless you.  Don't sneeze in the middle of my entertainment report.  Sorry.  You already read all the stories.  Abk has greenlit a new reality show.  No, we didn't.  Called Sing Your Face Off.  Now, what kind of celebrities are going to be on this?  Five celebrities are transformed into legendary singers and performers?  Yeah.  So, what kind of celebrities do you think, Chipper?  Fucking, um...  I would say the girl who played Joe on The Facts of Life. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  She's fucking famous.  I haven't seen her in quite a while.  Yeah, Nancy McKeon.  That was her, yeah.  I know who it was.  Oh.  So, uh, her?  The lady who played Edna Garrett on The Facts of Life.  Well, they're not going to have two people from The Facts of Life.  Oh, fuck yeah, they will.  They'll just start singing.  Well, who else, then?  Go and play Blair on The Facts of Life.  No, that's great.  It's not the singer... 
[00:19:00]  She's a fucking great celebrity.  It's not people from The Facts of Life sing their face off.  Yeah.  And nobody knows that show anymore.  Yeah, the fuck they do.  No, it's not really, Chip.  Well, you've still got two spots left.  Yeah.  Yeah, who else?  Tim Fields.  Oh, Judy.  What was she on?  She was the black girl from The Facts of Life.  Oh, okay.  My mom would always say,  don't you ever come home with her, Chip,  or you'll be sleeping outside on a porch.  But she had Lamar.  Yeah, she was fucking black guys all the time.  No, she wasn't.  She was helping members of the community get back on their feet. 
[00:19:30]  And who else?  Well, we got a fifth celebrity, yes.  Mindy Khan.  Who's that?  Cohen, right?  I don't like to say that,  because my mother didn't like the Jewie people.  She said, don't bring no Jewie Kite burgers into this house, Chip.  Jesus.  I said, Ma, that's not proper.  You can tell how Chip got so far.  Yeah.  My mother said, if you want to see how many Jewish people are somewhere,  you roll a penny.  She says, Chip, or they run after it and bang their heads.  My mother's a very wise, special woman.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  But Mindy Cohen.  Okay.  She was Natalie from The Facts of Life.  So is it going to be a theme?  She's very Rubenesque.  She looks like my mother, but she smiles more than my mother would.  So the celebrities are, like, thematic every week?  No.  They have a new show that they...  No, they're not.  So the second week, who would you say would be on?  Um.  Um.  Huh?  Probably Jennifer Anburys from Friends. 
[00:20:30]  Aniston?  Yeah.  And who else?  David Swinger.  See, you're doing a thematic cast every week.  It's from a different show.  Everybody's just fucking dancing.  No, they're singing the face off.  Oh, I forgot.  I'm thinking of my show.  What's with your show?  Dance Your Cunt Off.  It's where you get a bunch of girls,  and they've got to do, like, a really hard country left and right step 
[00:21:00]  until that cunt falls out.  And when your cunt falls out on the floor,  you win a prize or something.  So it's all kinds of dances where their cunt could fall out,  like river dancing, I guess.  Yeah.  Clogging.  Or the hard step, like, yo,  a one and two and three.  Right, right, country line dancing.  Yeah.  Not a soft shoe, though.  That wouldn't work.  I don't care what they've got on their feet.  No, it's a type of dance.  Oh. 
[00:21:30]  You're dancing your cunt off.  Dance your cunt off.  Chip, you're losing focus from the...  I was going to put it on the fucking YouTubes.  Right.  You're losing focus from the entertainment show that you're supposed to do.  That is entertaining.  The radio show.  Everybody would watch.  I wonder whose cunt is going to fall off.  It's this.  It's this.  She's got a cute face.  Wow.  Yeah.  She's a turnip.  Oh, well.  Just people walk by the studio.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  We're distracted.  By a turnip. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  So that's a good conversation about that new show, Sing Your Face Off.  That's pretty good.  Any other stories you want to elaborate on?  You gave the headlines.  We're elaborating a little more now, Chip.  Help.  Three surviving monkeys are going out on tour.  All right.  But there's not going to be no singing because the guy's dead, so they're just going to play  the music.  No, there are singers.  Yeah, they'll harmonize.  Mickey Dolenz is pretty much the lead singer in that band there.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  But now, are they going to be getting, who was the one that never really, Michael Nesmith?  Michael Nesmith.  He never really liked being with the Monkees.  He had the whiteout fortune, but I guess since the computer, the whiteout fortune, yeah,  he needs a little money.  Chippa, what do you think?  That stock is dropped by now.  Chippa, what do you think?  I don't know, but I wouldn't mind going in there and fucking playing some sick fucking  puppy tunes.  This isn't the entity.  We talk about the story.  Hey, you know what's we talking about?  The Monkees going on tour. 
[00:23:00]  Mike Nesmith.  Mickey Dolenz.  Peter Tork.  My fucking, the new sick fucking puppy song.  The Devil's Circus.  How does it go?  I heard.  How does it go?  I don't think you've heard this one yet.  Oh, I heard how it goes.  No, I don't think you've heard this one yet.  No, I did.  No, I don't think so.  How does it go?  How does it go?  First performance yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  It's a devil's circus.  You've lost focus completely.  It's your demo.  You've lost focus altogether.  So it's circus music played on a guitar with a lot of fucking distortion on it.  A lot of fuzz.  Fucking devil's circus.  But this isn't about sick fucking puppies.  I heard two and a half minutes coming back on.  Oh, right.  Now, Angus T. Jones, he had a problem with the show.  He got very religious and had a problem with some of the themes of the show. 
[00:24:00]  He figured they were anti-god.  He has cancer.  No, he doesn't.  Now you're just spreading rumors.  I just say stuff sometimes and I'm running out of shit to say.  Just got to keep talking.  Ran over the list of stories twice.  He was arrested for rape.  No, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  He wasn't at all.  He's just, I guess, the...  Catherine Zeta-Jones is in prison.  No.  She ran over somebody with a bus.  She was backing up and she hit that cunt.  No.  No. 
[00:24:30]  She's in the hospital for a bipolar disorder, but it has nothing to do with...  She never hit anyone with a bus.  Oh, my God.  She fucking bipolar.  She hit someone with an ax.  No.  That fucking bitch is crazy.  She was all fucking zooted on her medicine, running around, throwing soup on people, I  heard.  No, that never happened.  Yeah.  She even threw fucking throat cancer at Michael Douglas and he ate it.  Jesus.  That's what happened.  He did have throat cancer, but he beat it.  It kind of makes sense. 
[00:25:00]  He beat it, though.  I guess that's the way you could get it, yeah.  John Krasniewski fucking left Arrested Development.  He's going to start in the office now.  No.  You got it backwards.  He's from the office.  Aren't you trying?  You got to try, Chip.  I am trying.  It's a big opportunity for you.  You got to try.  I am.  You can be the voice of the station.  Yeah.  The whole channel.  People like the music, though.  You let it play for a few minutes.  A few minutes?  You can talk about Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  He's got kidney stones. 
[00:25:30]  And then maybe talk about some of the other Jersey Shore guys.  And what they are doing.  Yeah.  You see Snooki get fucking punched in the face?  Yeah.  Years ago.  That was like the first season of five years.  Yeah.  They go do that laundry and shit.  No good.  Hey, I'm going to press my shirt or something.  What are you going out to get some fucking cooter?  Fucking fist pump.  I don't know.  I used to fist pump, too.  Did you?  Fuck, yeah.  And you got to watch the language.  This isn't a show.  They want it real.  I don't know.  No, no.  No, they don't. 
[00:26:00]  It's more of a.  This is XL shit, you know.  You're going to be talking to a lot of women.  A lot of women are interested in.  I got a big fucking peck on, ladies.  No, no, no.  How'd you like it stuck with a baby's fallout?  Third time running through the list of stories.  How'd you like me to fill your dunce hole?  Chim.  See, no, Chim.  You can't curse. 
[00:26:30]  I don't have to curse.  You got to stick to the stories.  And you got to elaborate on them.  Just don't read the headlines.  You have to be conversational.  Okay.  So what's up?  What are you doing?  You know, I heard Catherine Vader-Jones is back in treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  Well, what do you have on that, Chim?  She previously saw treatment in 2011.  And all of a sudden, now she's back in a treatment facility for bipolar disorder.  Catherine Zeta-Jones. 
[00:27:00]  So anything you have that can maybe elaborate on this?  Yeah, she was already there.  2011.  That's two years ago.  She was there, but now she got out.  Now she's back in there again.  And she's got bipolar disorder.  You're just rephrasing the statement in the headline.  You got to elaborate a little bit.  I am elaborating.  I don't think you are.  She's a little extra.  Yeah, this is extra.  Maybe your personal opinion.  She's married to Michael Douglas.  Oh, there you go.  You're good.  All right.  And she was in a place in 2011 for bipolar disorder.  Right back to the fucking stress.  And now she's back there. 
[00:27:30]  What do you think of that?  What's that?  What do you think of that?  I think that it's been two years since she's been in a place for bipolar disorder.  And she's gone back there.  We get it.  What's up with big ball guy or big balls guy?  Does he have both balls?  Man has surgery for 134 pounds scrotum.  He walks around.  Now, he's sitting on some type of bus here.  Right.  And a public, you know, bus.  And he carries around a plastic milk crate, you know those milk crates, with a pillow.  And he's got to sit on the chair. 
[00:28:00]  And then in between his legs, he puts the milk crate upside down with the pillow on it and rests his gigantic 134 pound ball bag on the milk crate and pillow.  Wow.  That's a huge fucking ball.  He wasn't born this way.  What a burden.  It just started growing?  For five painful years, Wesley Warren Jr. watched as his scrotum slowly swelled into a 134 pound mass that hung to his ankles.  All right.  Get Dr. Stephen.  Well, why the fuck wouldn't he stop when it was like... 
[00:28:30]  Well, maybe it'll get better.  When it was like...  80 pounds.  It's like if the diameter of your ball bag increases by like an eighth of an inch, how about you go to the doctor?  But there's a lot of wiring down there.  How do you take care of that?  He recalled a mid-sleep maneuver that slammed his right testicle.  I felt the most enormous amount of pain that one could possibly imagine.  And then it just starts growing from that point?  The pain quickly subsided as if a big rig was rolling off his scrotum. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  I felt like I dodged a bullet.  Oh, big rig.  The following day, the sack had stretched to the size of a soccer ball.  So, did he go...  He's not saying...  I went to the ER and they treated it as though I had some kind of infection.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, antibiotics.  Went to other doctors.  No one was able to figure out anything for me.  Oh, please.  They would refer me to other doctors because I don't have insurance or the financial means to pay for these folks on demand.  The appointment would be six weeks away or three months away.  Ugh.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Lives off disability. 
[00:29:30]  Turn sick.  Yeah.  And who's going to hire him?  He had help from...  Quite the distraction at the workplace.  Yeah.  Look at his ball bag.  Right.  Jesus.  Oh, Dr. Steve will be calling us to talk about big balls in five minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  Because he's dropping his children off.  Oh, okay.  I would have said to the guy, you're nuts.  That's pretty good, Chip.  I know.  Oh, 13-hour surgery.  So what is he down to now?  For what?  Like, what was...  To remove the 134-pound mass.  But what was the mass? 
[00:30:00]  Uh...  And how did he get it?  Just by rolling over in his sleep.  Nah, he rolled over in his sleep and it...  It fucking...  That's when he realized he had something going on down there.  Something ruptured.  It took out a fluid collection.  Flood.  No, he already had something growing and when he maneuvered in bed, it exposed it to him.  Scrotal lymphedema?  What is it?  Lymphedema.  Lymphedema.  Scrotal lymphedemia.  Scrotal lymphedema is what happens when your scrotum grows.  Filled up of fluid.  Fluid.  The mass. 
[00:30:30]  And tissue.  Tissue.  It will knit itself into the fabric of your scrotum.  You know, those things you can't get on the show.  Tissue.  Tissue.  I don't even know you.  Yeah.  Hey, this is what you get when you wash your neck.  You get Kleenex.  Full of them.  Dr. Steve Chipperson.  Of something.  Fluids or something.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's a big mass or something.  You know, a bunch of people in church inside of your scrotum or something. 
[00:31:00]  That's it.  You know, like Dr. Steve Chipperson?  No.  Who would?  Flood.  Yeah, a bunch of fluid.  Wow, that's...  I hate those stories.  You gotta, like, grab your...  You gotta grab your balls when you're hearing these stories.  I don't know why.  Grab yours?  Ow.  Ooh.  I like that.  Yeah, baddest bag must have seen.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  What?  What happened?  You know that feeling you get in your balls when you go in a car, like, and you're going  over a hill?  Where you're going downhill and then it goes uphill really quick?  Like it sinks back into you?  What is that?  I gotta ask Dr. Steve that.  Why do you get a feeling in your ball bag when you go down a hill and then back up like that?  What is that?  Well, it's basically the...  It's your sinking back and it's gravity kind of pulling you back towards the center of your 
[00:32:00]  own gravity, which would be where you're seated.  I don't buy that.  Yeah.  Because it's when you go up and over a hill or when you go down and up, so you're getting  the increase in Gs and negative Gs on your ball bag.  You don't have any H's or I's or something.  No, sus.  Sus, uh, ah.  Sus. 
[00:32:30]  Yo, we got...  I got a mustard.  Sus.  That's when you have a bunch of mushers and you hide them somewhere.  Sus.  Sus.  Dr. Steve, we got a story of a guy.  His fucking balls or his scrotum got up to 134 pounds.  Nice.  And he said he moved in the middle of the night and fucking felt incredible pain.  I guess he, what, twisted the wrong way or something.  And that's what he's claiming caused this, which I doubt very much.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Uh, yeah, that's called massive scrotal edema.  What the fuck?  Well, a lot of times it'll happen when the, uh, uh, venous supply of the scrotum is blocked.  So, if you get, um, some compression of the vein, then the arteries can still pump blood in.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's disgusting.  So, how do you take care of this?  Surgery is the only, the only option on that.  Compression will actually make it worse. 
[00:33:30]  Does everyone get soaked in the operating room?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, compression will do what?  Compression will just make it worse.  Like, people think, well, you got a swollen leg, you put them in a compression stocking.  But compressing, uh, swollen ball bag will actually make the, uh, the problem worse.  So you can't jump up and down on it?  Uh, yeah, just by the end, sometimes people with cancer, uh, you get torsion of the testicles  will cause, uh, torsion of testicles where you twist the cord of the testicle so much 
[00:34:00]  that it cuts off the blood supply.  Now, that's a surgical emergency.  But usually it doesn't cause a scrotum that's, you know, 14 pounds or 40 pounds or whatever  you said.  You could probably lose a testicle that way if it's not receiving nourishment.  Absolutely.  Oh, Jesus.  This guy got it up to 134 pounds.  You chicks think it's fucking, your tits are a problem.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:34:30]  Got these fucking balls hanging down.  Imagine trying to walk around with that shit hanging between your legs.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you have to bounce on them or something.  I really think I like this one.  How fast do you go through the easy?  Because I drove with Chip once at the airport and he was explaining to me that, you know, 
[00:35:00]  the, uh, you know, the spikes that they put so you don't reverse?  Yeah.  I love backing over those things.  Chip, every single time that we passed one of those, which was many times, he would explain  to me that sometimes he likes to bag up over them just to hear the sound.  Yeah.  Fucking tires.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right over.  So, so do you go through the easy pass fast then?  Fuck yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Yup.  I put the fucking easy pass right up there.  I zip right through.  How fast?  Fucking 80.  80?  Yup.  Wow.  Is that with the gate?  I fuck gates.  Sometimes I just hear a smack and people yelling behind me.  I keep going.  I don't give a fuck.  Tunes are cranking.  I got Loverboy playing.  Loverboy?  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  I've driven with Chip before.  He's not a good driver.  No, no.  He drove through, uh, Midtown at, very late at night, swerving in lanes and honking.  I could imagine he'd be a very good driver. 
[00:36:00]  He's terrible.  Yeah.  He tends to be aggressive at the wrong times.  Too slow at other times.  I'll get a video idea and then we'll give it a shot.  I'll be like, what are you looking for?  Some catnap or something?  Catnip.  Nip, yes.  Oh, catnip or something?  Yeah, there you go.  You can take a catnap looking for catnip.  Uh-oh, don't kidnap the cat.  He's looking for catnip.  He's going to kidnap.  Catnap.  He's getting obsessive.  Fuck yeah.  I'll just go nuts with the cat terms.  He really is. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm careful I don't catapult you while you're looking for a fucking catnap and taking a catnap.  Oh, with a cat thing, we get it, Chip.  He needs to drop that pump.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking you guys' podcast.  My fucking podcast is fucking amazing.  It's the fucking biggest one out there.  Yeah?  I have a podcast.  Fuck yeah, I do.  I haven't even seen it.  It's called Chipper Speaks.  Sounds ominous.  You know, the way Kevin Pollack does his talk and walk-in thing, Jim should have a podcast 
[00:37:00]  where Chip interviews people.  I got one.  It's the fucking biggest.  My podcast is fucking sold out.  Sold out?  My podcast is sold out.  How do you sell out a podcast?  Fuck yeah.  That's what they were saying.  Presented a real idea, then we're just back here.  You can't get it no more.  Sold the fuck out.  No more copies.  Sold out.  It's free and they're digital.  Eight million or something.  I got very good news.  What's that?  We haven't heard from them in many years. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, who's that?  Curse man.  What?  Hello?  Peckas.  Hey, curse man.  What's going on, curse man?  Farts.  Big shit.  Where you been?  Fuckers.  Where you been for 16 years, curse man?  Farts.  Assholes.  Uh, words that describe Hopi and Anthony?  It's curse man.  Hey, curse man.  What's up?  Hey, big fucking peckers. 
[00:38:00]  Where you been?  Huh?  Where you been for 16 years?  Um, farts.  See, he's cursed man.  He's just cursed.  Big stinky fucking vaginas.  Big fucking bitch would come all over him.  He's not even saying anything.  With a bunch of fucking shit hanging out of him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not, uh...  I'm cursing.  Oh, he's...  How did you hit me with the door?  Someone hit him with the door. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  All right.  Well, good to hear from you again, curse man.  No, no, no goodbye, no nothing.  No, of course.  He just...  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  Good looking girl.  She's good looking.  I like that.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, no.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  That's Chip Baca. 
[00:39:00]  What?  Chip Baca.  Yeah, maybe it's...  The Wookiee.  Yeah.  Millennium Falcon.  Why'd they call it like the Millennium Eagle?  Where did you create Chip Baca?  Just hours alone in my house doing that over and over again.  Television show or a joke to write or something?  No, just alone.  Hours you did that?  Dude, I just...  Hours.  I walked around just being Chip Baca all day in my fucking house. 
[00:39:30]  Chip Baca.  To yourself.  Yeah.  Han Solo.  How come he doesn't have friends?  That's something.  What the fuck?  Fucking Yoda.  Fucking Greenwood Envy.  That's something.  Whatever.  That's horrible.  Jedi.  Should be a jet nose.  I don't really like Chip Baca either. 
[00:40:00]  No, I don't either.  Who shot first?  Han or Greedo?  Yeah.  What's that?  Who shot first?  Yeah.  Greedo.  How come he doesn't be happy with what he's got?  Chip Baca is going to be a sensation.  No, he's not.  You don't think so?  No.  I thought of it because I was talking to somebody about the Star Wars fucking Christmas special.  I watched a little bit of it.  Yeah.  God.  Isn't that so utterly bad? 
[00:40:30]  The fact that that got made is just atrocious.  Yeah.  How anybody shot that and thought it was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Maud.  Well, it was starving for anything Star Wars related.  Oh, God.  It was terrible.  So that's probably what went into it.  Mala and Lumpy and Itchy, the names.  Oh, they were terrible.  And then Jefferson Starship or something was there.  I didn't watch the whole thing.  It was there.  And then they were all talking.  They were a big get back then.  It was so bad.  See, but this is now online.  This was really hard to find for a really long time. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  The Star Wars Holiday Show 1978 on YouTube.  That one has no audio.  You've got to get one with audio, Sam.  That one's got no audio.  Oh, there it is.  No.  The audio was taken off.  Yeah, they took it off.  Why?  Because it was a copyright violation.  So you have to find little clips.  Find them with the Spanish subtitles.  I was watching that one.  Wait, but they allow the video to stay up there, but not the audio?  I don't know how, yeah.  Oh.  Lumpy.  The announcer.  With special guest star, Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice. 
[00:41:30]  Art Carney.  Oh, is this embarrassing?  Oh, my God.  Is this fucking horrid?  Diane Carroll.  Oh.  You think this is good?  This is embarrassing.  Jefferson Starship.  Jefferson Starship.  You know, for Starship?  Right.  That's cool.  Harvey Korman.  Who thought this?  Oh, awful.  Animated Star Wars story on the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Oh, so awful.  Wow.  Life day.  They had to get back for a life day. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Oh, this is so bad.  You know, like when they zoom in on the Wookiee's house and for 10 minutes there's no dialogue?  Yes, they're just making noises.  They show Itchy and Mala and Lumpy playing in the house.  Nice music.  It's like a regular house.  Except they're shit sticking to their phone.  The rainbow connection.  Shit sticking to their phone.  The kids coming down with a fake plane.  This is it.  Them just making these noises. 
[00:42:30]  Star Wars is like a massive movie and on a big movie set and everything.  This is not a shitty TV studio.  This is all about marketing, though.  That's why I hate George Lucas.  It's just to sell stuff.  What are they saying, Chip Baca?  He's going, look at this plane.  How come it's not called a symbol?  And the old guy's going, get away from me, Chip Baca.  Go in your room or something.  I got to lay down with Lamar.

It's the worst of 2013, like the production said for the Opie and Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock hosting this thing for you until Opie and Anthony decide that they're done with vacation and want to come back.  In this segment, James Lipton is in studio. 
[00:47:30]  He's the host of Inside Actor's Studio.  Of course you know that.  He stopped by promoting his new book and tells a story about a time when he was working in Paris.  He said he was a tour guide.  Doesn't make any sense.  But he'll explain everything here.  James Lipton, right now.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Obviously, we were astounded by the list of people you have interviewed.  It's quite extensive and an amazing array of celebrities. 
[00:48:00]  When did you start interviewing people in this fashion?  Well, 19 years ago.  That's it.  In 1994, when the earth was covered in mists.  I had an idea as a member of the Actors Studio that we ought to create a degree-granting program for the first time in the history of the studio, which was then 47 years old.  And you know the people that had given us, James Dean and Paul Newman and Marlon Brando and so forth, right up through Pacino and through De Niro and Jack Nicholson, etc. 
[00:48:30]  And I suggested at that time that we...  The studio, first of all, was a very private place.  It was a gymnasium.  And nobody was allowed in from the outside.  It was a place where people could go and what?  Make mistakes.  Why?  Because you learn from your mistakes, right?  But you don't want to make them in public once you're famous.  That's how it worked.  I said, why don't we create a degree-granting program for the first time? 
[00:49:00]  We don't have to let people in.  The studio is still on 44th Street.  It's still a private, cranky place where nobody can get in.  But let's let this method that has been honed all these years out in an educational environment.  And that was how we started the Actor's Studio Drama School, which is now at Pace University.  And when we started the Actor's Studio Drama School, I had people who would... 
[00:49:30]  All of our core courses, by the way, are taught by life members of the Actor's Studio.  That way we'd get the continuity that we wanted.  And so we had people who would teach 30 weeks.  People would come in and do six Fridays in a workshop.  But there was one category left that was unfilled.  And that was those people who are members of the studio or friends of ours or colleagues with whom we've worked who could only give us one.  One night of their lives. 
[00:50:00]  So I sent a letter out and said, will you come and teach our students for one night?  Paul Newman answered.  Dennis Hopper answered.  Sally Field answered.  I got these extraordinary people saying, yes, we'll do it.  And that's when I sent word back into the professional community.  I was by now dean of the Actor's Studio Drama School, which I had created it.  So they said, well, you'll give it a year.  Start it, you know.  How long have you been at the studio by this time?  Had you been there since the beginning?  Only two years I'd been there by then.  I was trained by Stella Adler and Harold Klerman. 
[00:50:30]  And so I got these responses.  And I sent word back into the professional community from which I had come.  And I said, look, these people are liable to say something worth preserving.  And anybody interested, because that means television cameras.  And Bravo took the existential leap with me.  At that time, Bravo had 20 million people.  That is to say, and Cablevision.  They were owned by Cablevision.  There were 20 million subscribers. 
[00:51:00]  Today, we are in 94 million homes on Bravo.  We are in 125 countries.  We have a record-breaking 15 Emmy nominations.  And if you had put a gun to my head in 1994 and said, predict that or die, I would have said, pull the trigger.  Can I ask, when you do us such an amazing prep for these interviews, do publicists give you the same thing they give us?  Well, you can't ask about this.  You can't ask, what are the parameters you allow?  We are about to do our 250th episode.  Wow. 
[00:51:30]  Not one publicist has ever told me I can or cannot do anything.  Not one.  There is no pre-interview on our show.  We're the only talk show of our kind that has no pre-interview.  That's why I have to work for two weeks to do those three or four hundred cards all by myself.  And the result of that has been that the guest walks in and has absolutely no idea what's coming next.  That's the rigid rule on our show.  And nobody has ever asked to violate it. 
[00:52:00]  Not once.  I'm amazed by that.  That level of trust they have for you.  It's trust and right.  Well, they know that we're going to talk about craft.  We're not interested in gossip.  Right.  We're a master's degree program.  Those are master's degree candidates sitting out there at Pace University.  And so they know that we're not going to get into gossip.  We don't care about it.  We really don't care.  Seriously.  And what do we care about?  We care about the work they've done.  And if I were to ask you or you or anybody in this room, look, I'm going to interview you. 
[00:52:30]  And what we'll talk about, I'm just going to ask you about those turning points in your life that made you whoever the hell you are now.  Both as an artist, in the case of our show, and as a person.  And you start, and I've done my research, and I know that there was a turning point.  Somebody died, therefore they did this.  And so I ask them, describe to me what happened.  And then they tell me what happened.  And in doing so, what happens?  It's called effective memory in the Stanislavski system. 
[00:53:00]  What happens is the emotions that they felt at the time begin to come back.  And as a result, we became, to my absolute astonishment, the most intimate and the most emotional show of our kind.  And who gave you the most emotional interview that you can think of?  Bradley Cooper.  Yeah?  Look, when I was asked over and over again, over the years, who's the guest you want the most?  I said, look, I was for 10 years the dean of the Actors Studio Journalist School.  I was its founding dean.  I'm no longer its dean.  I'm Dean Emeritus.  And I said, the night that one of my graduated students has achieved so much that he or she walks out on that stage and sits down in that chair next to me is going to be the night I've waited for since we started this program. 
[00:53:30]  And Bradley Cooper graduated in 2000.  We trained him for three years.  And when Bradley walked out on that stage, he looked at me and I looked at him.  We burst into tears.  And we had this.  Wow.  We couldn't go on with the show for a bit until both of us had recovered.  So there is that kind of emotional attachment in the show that, again, doesn't make us better. 
[00:54:00]  I hope it doesn't make us worse.  But it sure as hell makes us different.  Yeah.  And it's honest.  I mean, obviously, not talking about the gossipy end of it, just the craft and just open honesty about it.  I think people feel safe there, too.  It doesn't feel like they're going to be blindsided by some TMZ reporter.  No, because that's look.  We're a master's class in a university. 
[00:54:30]  We don't care about those things.  Our students don't care.  They would be disappointed in me if I asked a question about it had nothing to do with the reason that we're all there.  And the result for us, for our students, remember, we're in 125 countries.  That's not a joke.  We were immense in France, in Japan, in Australia, in the Scandinavian countries, in Latin America.  The show is just huge.  And the result is that our students come to us from all over the world, and they come to us for a reason. 
[00:55:00]  And the guests know that there's a reason.  And therefore, the guests have a reason for coming there, which is to teach them.  And it turned out, I thought it would be so dull.  I thought it would be so dry.  We wouldn't last a year.  I'm serious.  I thought we wouldn't last a year.  Here we are, 19 years, the second longest running show in the history of cable television.  All of these things, it sounds like I'm bragging.  Maybe I am.  But it's also the truth.  And it's not something that I had anticipated or even planned. 
[00:55:30]  It just evolved organically, the way an acting role is supposed to evolve.  Yeah.  How did you accept being thrust into pop culture like that?  I mean, the parodies that have been done about you, which are hilarious.  It appears that I am a figure in pop culture.  Sure.  Watch Arrested Development when it comes back on the air on Netflix.  I'm back on the show. 
[00:56:00]  The Warden Gentles, like the character that I created on the original show.  I'm back on the air.  The Will Ferrell, of course.  Yeah.  We all know about that.  And it's not something that I can plan, but it is something that, to be perfectly frank, that I treasure.  Yeah.  I mean, Will's a friend.  He asked me to be in his movie with him, which I did.  And this thing has evolved, too, over the years, this relationship. 
[00:56:30]  Do I like it?  People ask me, do you hate it?  Hate it?  I would crawl on broken glass to have this kind of thing happen to me.  It must have been odd, though, to be the dean of a university.  It's all happening at once.  I was one of seven deans in a university, which is an academic position, of course.  And at the same time, all this madness was happening. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  What a, that's an amazing story.  Of all the people you've talked to, what was something that shocked you?  Like, what's the piece of information somebody gave you?  The most shocking one, I think, well, brace yourselves.  It's quite a tale.  It's brief.  Jack Lemmon was on.  I'd known Jack Lemmon when I was a young actor and came to New York, and he was already a famous actor.  And Jack was, you may know, an absolutely elegant human being. 
[00:57:30]  And it was near the end of his life, just a few months from the end of his life, and he was on the show.  And because I'm dean of the school, I'm always trying to make a point for the actors.  I'm didactic, which is one of the things people make fun of me for, and some people dislike me for.  They think it makes me pompous.  And, but I'm always trying to teach them something.  And so I was, here I was working with Jack, and we were talking about Days of Wine and Roses.  And I said to him, you know, the, all the famous scenes in it, the scene next to the crib with the child, 
[00:58:00]  the scene in the greenhouse when you smash it, trying to find a bottle that you can't, you stowed there.  The scene when you're arrested, all those huge scenes, emotional scenes.  But the most moving, the most thrilling scene in the movie is the quietest.  When you stand up in front of the, of AA for the first time and say those historic words.  And then I paused.  I'm always trying to get my guest, I tried to get De Niro to say, you're talking to me, he wouldn't do it. 
[00:58:30]  I did get Tom Hanks to say, life is like a box of chocolate.  And I waited for him to say it, and he said it.  And he said, my name is, he couldn't recall, and he said, my name is so-and-so, and I'm an alcoholic.  And I turned to the students and I said, see, look, no pushing, no pushing, no begging for anything. 
[00:59:00]  Just do it.  Just do what the character does and let the audience provide the emotion.  See, no pushing.  I said, that's acting.  And he said, no, it's not.  I'm an alcoholic.  Oh, wow.  And there follows a 15-second pause, which I kept in the edit, because I edited the show.  And it's right there, and we just stare at each other.  And I saw he didn't want to go any further, and so I went on to the next question.  But it was the most startling moment in the history of the show. 
[00:59:30]  And afterward, his wife said to me in the green room, first time Jack's ever said that in public.  Wow.  Wow.  So the fact that he said that, I guess, obviously meant he was in recovery and had kept that private.  Wow.  Yeah.  He was, yeah, but he had never admitted to it in public in his life until that moment.  Would you call that a surprise?  Yeah.  Well, not in this studio, I wouldn't.  Come on, I enjoy a couple of beers myself.  You're an interesting guy, too, in that you, like, how much of this is folklore, but back in France, when you were a younger guy, you, you know, what is this? 
[01:00:00]  Oh, God, are you going there?  We have to ask.  Yeah, you were, you were, you were, I don't want to say a pimp per se, but.  I was a mech, macro, which is not, which is not strictly speaking, a pimp.  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  And generally speaking, that relationship, nowadays, it's unthinkable, unthinkable.  I'm talking about when I was a youngster. 
[01:00:30]  This is long, long ago, where it was all regulated in France and so forth.  But a pimp exploits the women and often treats them horribly.  We all know that.  But a macro works for the women.  They employ him.  And I was living in, I was living in Paris.  I had no, I couldn't get a work permit.  It was out of the question in those days.  Were you acting there?  Are you there?  I had gone, I was, I had been acting in Greece in a film. 
[01:01:00]  And then I came back and I didn't want to come back to the United States for a while.  I wanted to live in Europe and I particularly wanted to live in Paris.  There's an expression in French called rite de passage, rites of passage.  I was going through it and I wanted to continue to go through it.  And I had met by chance, because I had gone, as Americans did in those days, to the Rupi Gala.  To see a sex exhibition, which was, in those days, was commonplace in Paris and in America didn't exist at all. 
[01:01:30]  And afterward, I had had a drink in the bar in the bordello and met the young woman who had participated in this.  And we became friends.  She was from Cannes.  She was a beautiful young Canoise.  And in those days, France was going through a very hard time.  And the men couldn't get work and certainly the women couldn't.  And there was no opprobrium associated with women who went into what was called le milieu, which is that world, and then came out of it. 
[01:02:00]  No names I could name for you, movie stars and so forth in France, who were in it for a time.  And there was nothing.  There were students who were in it, who were earning their way through school.  Women who were supporting their husbands who were going to college, for example.  It was an entirely different world and completely regulated, medically regulated and everything.  Anyway, then when I ran out of money, she suggested that I would become her mech so that I could stay there and we could continue our friendship and our relationship. 
[01:02:30]  And I did.  And it was one of the most interesting years of my life.  Now you know the whole story.  What is one of the responsibilities of my life?  I would go to the – in the morning, I would appear at American Express, which is where all the tourists turned up, especially the American tourists, right next to the Palais Garnier and to the Paris Opera. 
[01:03:00]  And other people would be there saying, would you like – I conduct tours.  Would you like to see Chartres?  Would you like to see Notre Dame de Paris, et cetera?  All these people would be – these tour guides.  I was a tour guide.  I would say, you'll want to see some sex.  Okay.  And these Americans, startled Americans would say, yes, this is really what they came to Paris for in those days.  And then –  When was this, roughly?  The 1950s.  Oh, okay.  And so, you know, France was still recovering from the Second World War. 
[01:03:30]  And then I would have to go with them because they were nervous.  They were frightened about it.  And so, I would take them there to the bordello.  And my girlfriend and another woman or man or whatever it was we had arranged, this thing would occur.  And they were – these people were electrified by it.  And they would ask me to translate for them and speak to these people and tell them what they wanted to see and so forth.  So, it was a very strange time in my life. 
[01:04:00]  But it was literally the only way I could remain in France.  I couldn't have a living any other way.  I would gladly have done something else.  Now, that's probably a much more fun way to make a living.  Did you get involved?  Interesting.  Were you a part of the –  What do you mean by get involved?  Well, you know.  No.  What I would love to have done.  No.  No.  No.  I mean, she was my girlfriend for Christmas.  Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't going to, you know, betray her with – even with her.  Wow.  You follow me?  It's very complicated.  You didn't get jealous?  No.  No, no. 
[01:04:30]  Well, she wasn't – we were friends.  We were really friends more than anything else.  Right, yeah.  And she had arranged for this.  It had to be arranged for her.  They would have found me floating in the sand because you couldn't – you couldn't practice that profession  unless you had been endorsed, okay?  And so she got me endorsed.  Wow.  What a great story.  I've never discussed this with anybody else before on radio. 
[01:05:00]  It's quite amazing part of your history and just part of history.  We never do that.  What's going on?  I never would have discussed it at all.  I did in my memoir, Inside, Inside.  It's there in black and white for everybody to read.  But Arthur Lawrence, the great playwright, had been there with a whole group of people.  Stella Adder, who was my acting teacher, and they were all there in Paris.  They came for the summer, and I was there, and that was when I was working.  And they asked me to – and I took them all and arranged one for them as a sex exhibition. 
[01:05:30]  And Arthur wrote about it in his memoir.  Oh, really?  Yeah, six years ago, just before I wrote my memoir.  And he talked about it, and so I felt he had outed me.  Did he drop your name in there?  Drop my name?  I thought maybe it was an anonymous type of –  No!  He devoted a chapter.  He called me –  He didn't mention your name. 
[01:06:00]  He was the guy who hosts the actor's studio.  No, I wasn't that then.  He called me the sex guide.  Wow.  And so once that had been done, there was nothing I could do about it except my memoir to put it on record truthfully once and for all.  When Julia Roberts was on my show years ago, and Julia had played, of course, a prostitute famously, and I said,  did we interview prostitutes?  And so on.  She said, yes, and we got into that.  And then I began to talk about it.  I said, well, when I was in France, and so forth, and then I realized I had trapped myself. 
[01:06:30]  And that was long before I ever discussed it, and I didn't want to go any further with it.  And Julia – she started laughing.  She couldn't stop laughing.  And it's one of the most famous moments on the show where I was just sort of fumbling around, and I didn't know what to say or how to get out of it.  And Julia could not stop laughing.  I tried to drink her water, and her teeth were rattling on the glass.  She let you off the hook, or she probably could have pursued it.  Oh, she didn't.  But I didn't confess anything.  Right, right.  It wasn't until Arthur Lawrence wrote about it as an experience of his life that I decided I'd better set the record straight, such as it is. 
[01:07:00]  That's an interesting story.  And you know what?  It's so – it's in a time in history where it doesn't seem as seedy as anything like that now.  Listen, the women who were in the milieu in those days were – some of them were very, very elegant.  And it was – and as I say, they were examined weekly by a doctor.  It was completely regulated.  Some of the bordellos of that time were among the most famous in the history of the world. 
[01:07:30]  These women were like geishas.  And they were so royally treated.  And as I said, women moved in and out.  They needed the money.  They were desperate.  And so they would do this for a while, and then they would come out of it.  People would know that they were in it.  There's a very famous, very, very famous French movie star who was in and out of that milieu.  I won't say who it was.  And that's not my right.  But I know she was.  And when they came out of it, there was no opprobrium whatsoever. 
[01:08:00]  People never even gave it a thought.  Wow.  The French have always been – look, we're the United States of America.  We're uptight.  What tradition do we have that the French do not have?  The Puritan tradition.  There is a Puritan tradition in America which we inherited from England.  But the Catholic countries of Europe, France and Italy and so forth, do not have a Puritan tradition.  As a result, they look – neither does Asia.  Neither does Japan, for example.  And so in those countries, you don't find the same kind of nervousness or obsession with sex. 
[01:08:30]  They're much less – actually.  Much less obsessed.  Less uptight, too.  Just less uptight in general.  What's the difference with the Catholic Church today is that it has become absolutely riveted on the subject of sex.  Right, yeah.  And I'm not criticizing them.  That's their right.  But it is a fact.  And they are more sophisticated, perhaps, about it.  Mm-hmm.  And certainly more casual about it.  They don't see it as a – as every encounter is a life-changing event. 
[01:09:00]  Sure.  I'm not saying that's right or wrong.  But it's different from our own tradition.  We are more uptight.  And it has to do with our Puritan tradition.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think it takes away from some things that could be, you know, art.  I think it takes away from art in this country a lot.  Japanese art, the greatest Japanese artist, the Rembrandts and the Da Vinci's of Japan, all painted pornography. 
[01:09:30]  Pure, pure, graphic pornography.  My wife is half Japanese and half Irish, and she studied art with a great Japanese artist.  He was a national treasure.  They declare them national treasures in Japan.  And he gave her as a gift once, this – it hangs in our house, this painting by a master, one of the 18th century masters of Japanese painting.  And it is a pure pornographic painting.  And it has a place in your home right there prominently displayed. 
[01:10:00]  A pride of place.  You see?  Wonderful.  Love it.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Did you study with – did Brando study with Stella Adler, too?  Brando studied with Stella Adler.  De Niro studied with Stella Adler.  Harvey Keitel studied with Stella Adler.  I studied with her for two and a half years.  She taught for two years, and actually I was – she asked me to stay for another six months, which I did and worked with her.  She was the greatest single academic influence on my life. 
[01:10:30]  So you knew Brando?  Yes, I knew Brando.  When I first came to New York, he was already, you know, a star.  But he – I did know him quite well, you know.  I'm always fascinated with people who got to know him because he seems like one of these guys that was rather difficult to get to know.  Like –  At the end of his life, I was always trying to get him to be inside the actor's studio.  By then he was reclusive.  And he would sit up in his home and he would – and he would make phone calls.  He would call me.  And we would talk for 45 minutes, but he would never appear on the show. 
[01:11:00]  By then he would not come out of his house.  And he was very, very, very bizarre.  He'd speak to me in Spanish.  And I said, I don't speak Spanish.  And then he would stop.  But he –  But we used to talk for a long time.  And I said, why don't we say this on the air for God's sake?  Right, right.  And nobody wouldn't do it. 
[01:11:30]  So he's one that got away.  But he – by then, it wouldn't have been very valuable anyway because he had spit the bit.  And he was no longer interested in acting.  And he contemned it.  And he hated himself, as we all know.  It ended poorly.  Yeah.  But when I first saw him, when I first came to New York, I saw him in Streetcar.  Oh, wow.  And he was the greatest actor I ever saw.  Did he really dislike, like, guys like Rod Steiger?  Because there's this famous story about when they were doing that, you know, I could have been a contender, Charlie, that he wouldn't even do Rod's close-ups with him, that he just – he hated his acting. 
[01:12:00]  Is that the truth?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I don't know that he did.  But certainly that scene is justly famous.  He did everything wrong in it.  He did everything unpredictable in it.  Instead of being angry at his brother, instead of being frightened of his brother, the two things that you would think that any actor would have chosen, made those choices in the scene, his brother was destroying him at that moment. 
[01:12:30]  What was he instead?  He was heartbroken.  He was heartbroken that his brother would do this.  It was the most amazing choice.  And only a Brando could have made it.  I think that nothing impresses me in an actor more than risk.  If an actor takes chances and is utterly unpredictable, then I know I'm in the presence of a great actor. 
[01:13:00]  And there's one more ingredient that's necessary.  If the actor – first, you are absolutely startled by his choices or her choices.  And in the end, you realize they were what?  Inevitable.  That's what makes a great, great actor.  And that's why Brando, to my taste, is the greatest of his time.  And we have some great ones going now.  Who do you think is unpredictable now?  Like completely who's shocking? 
[01:13:30]  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Yeah.  Wow.  He is good.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Did Brando ever talk about acting and the actual craft of acting in public in any way?  Yeah.  He decided – after I started Inside the Actor's Studio, I think he was inspired by it because he's a member of the Actor's Studio.  He was so aware of it.  He decided he was going to teach a class in Los Angeles.  Advertisements went out.  People walked. 
[01:14:00]  And they rushed to be taught by Marlon Brando.  And they arrived at the appointed place.  And he waited for the door to open for him to come in.  He walked in in a dress, as I recall.  It lasted, I think, about 24 hours.  By then, he was two.  He hated acting.  Isn't that odd?  He thought that acting was not a worthy profession.  And you know why?  Because he was a genius.  Geniuses make one mistake consistently. 
[01:14:30]  They think that whatever they do is easy.  Why?  Because it's easy for them.  And they didn't have to learn it because it came from instinctively.  And as a result, they think it's easy.  And it's easy for them to become contemptuous of it.  Because, look, I'm doing this thing.  What's so special about what I'm doing?  Why should anybody make a fuss?  And eventually, people like Brando become contemptuous of it.  For example, Ted Williams had to teach himself every moment of swinging a bat. 
[01:15:00]  He could teach you how to swing a bat because he had had to teach himself.  He wasn't a genius.  What he was was a great, great, great, great student.  And he taught himself how to do it.  Willie Mays never gave it a minute's thought in his life he was a genius.  It just happened.  He would get up there, he'd swing the bat, and he'd hit a home run.  There are those two kinds of, those two approaches to a craft.  But, and Marlon was absolutely a genius.  He just was able to do it. 
[01:15:30]  Now, he was well trained by Stella Adler.  He had a thorough training from her.  When you put together technique with talent, you can't teach talent.  Talent's what you bring to the table.  I wonder what that's like.  Yeah, exactly.  I said, I wonder what that's like.  No, I'm sure you know.  But you put together talent and technique, and then out comes a Brando.  You know, I can't even watch movies like Miracle on 34th Street was on recently.  I just can't watch things from that era anymore. 
[01:16:00]  Because, again, like watching guys like Brando and like Hoppin or whoever, I can't watch the old school acting anymore.  It just seems so disconnected to anything I enjoy.  Well, because it was English acting, until the Stanislavski system took hold in America through the group theater,  out of which came Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg and all the teachers whom I have studied with.  Until then, it was a pale imitation of English theater.  They had a kind of false English accent.  Everything had to look good, and they practiced in front of a mirror until they had themselves just the way they wanted. 
[01:16:30]  None of it was organic.  None of it was felt.  None of it was emotional.  None of it was real.  It was all a system of posing.  It was rhetorical.  It was essentially false.  Very much like old stage acting.  That's what I'm talking about.  It was theater acting.  They took it to film.  But then when the Moscow Art Theater on Stanislavski came here in the 1920s, there was a revolution. 
[01:17:00]  And that was when Strasberg and Stella Adler and Harold Klerman and Cheryl Crawford,  they saw what was happening on that stage, and they knew that the door had opened.  It would never close again.  And then they founded the group theater.  Out of that came the plays of Odette's.  Out of that came all of our greatest actors.  And today, it's transcendent in the world.  There is no actor who is not touched by it in one way or another.  And in America, we've had some very, very, very great teachers.  The greatest of whom I thought was Stella Adler. 
[01:17:30]  And she did teach Brando.  And once again, there with me, I brought a minimal talent to it, so I was okay.  But he brought this great talent, put it together with her technique, and out came a very great actor.  This footage of...  Oh, that's the same with the...  Yeah, unfortunately.  I just want to ask one more question.  Did they say this footage...  I'm not a fan of Shakespeare.  I can't enjoy it.  But I watched Brando doing, like, you know...  You know, Mark Anthony, I think he was doing it. 
[01:18:00]  And I couldn't take my eyes off it, because it was like, this is the only guy I've ever seen do it.  Neither could the English actors.  I remember once...  One of the English actors on my show, was it Tony Hopkins or John Hurt?  I've forgotten which one it was.  Ian McKellen.  And they said to me, look at the Julius Caesar.  You'll see what Brando was doing was he...  Here we all came with this classical training, with the perfect body, the perfect voice, the perfect behavior.  And Brando came on that screen, and we were all of us in the shadow. 
[01:18:30]  And he was.  He was able to bring to it the kind of deeply felt emotions of American training and acting.  When applied to Shakespeare, who was a great writer of emotion, a great writer of feeling, a great writer of character. 
[01:19:00]  And when you put those two together, then you've got a performance like Brando's.  But, I mean, others do it very well.  I think Tony Hopkins is a perfect combination.  When he was on my show, he told me that while he was studying at the Royal Academy in London,  learning the kind of acting that we all associate with Shakespeare and with the English tradition,  he was sneaking off and studying Stanislavski with an actor, acting teacher in London,  and putting the two of them together.  And when you put that exterior technique, which is external, 
[01:19:30]  in which certain aspects of the character are acquired externally,  together with an internal technique that digs deep into your own soul  and makes you recreate whatever it was that Shakespeare wrote and said organically  from your own life experience and from your own deepest, deepest, the marrow of your bones,  then you get the kind of exquisite acting that all of us can react to and never forget. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  So rare to see.  They're telling us what they're doing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You have other press to do.  You have a lot more press to do.  You're very busy today, apparently.  James is promoting, of course, inside the actor's studio.  It's an amazing show.  You get more out of actors.  You watch Tina Fey, which is tomorrow night on Bravo.  And we talked about what?  Improvisation.  Because she came from Second City.  She gives a lesson in improvisation that is incomparable. 
[01:20:30]  And guess what?  We then improvised.  And I was allowed by her to interview Sarah Palin.  Oh, she does.  Watch it.  Yep.  She does.  We do about eight minutes together of Sarah Palin, of her Sarah Palin.  And it is absolutely extraordinary.  And it's improvisation.  Oh, totally improvise.  We're both improvising.  You're an amazing interviewer and a great guest.  Yeah, thanks so much.  What you get out of actors is amazing.  No one gets that stuff out of them. 
[01:21:00]  Thank you.  Fantastic.  Thanks for coming in.  And I think a great interviewer gets things out of people.  Like, you know, some people got James to talk about things that he hasn't talked about.  Right, Jimmy.  My wife, if she hears this, she's going to kill me.  Meanwhile, you should have maybe gotten an acting lesson from him instead of acting.  Yeah, I really should have.  I do things that are unpredictable, too.  I forget the lines.  And when I do remember, I suck.  Jimmy has a problem.  He doesn't know what to do with his hands to make them look natural as he's acting. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  He's either by there or fault.  Hands are the problem.  Look at, you watch Humphrey Bogart.  Bogart never figured out what to do with his hands.  He usually tucks them into the belt of his pants.  Really?  Bogart couldn't even figure it out?  Watch him.  He was never comfortable with his hands.  I find that, like, what I'll do is I'll just talk.  I'll just put them over my head out of frame.  People just forget that they exist.  That's why in the K-mutiny he was doing that with the Marvels, but he just brought those one day.  It wasn't even part of the script.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013.  Ah.

Looking back at the year of 2013 and all the cool stuff that has happened.  In this segment here, we check out a couple of segments from our own Jimmy Norton.  The first segment here is Norton talking about what he would be like if he was still drinking today. 
[01:27:00]  Had he not sobered up all those years ago, we go through what Jimmy would be like, how difficult he would be.  And then it goes into a segment about Jimmy coming up with a superhero character.  He wants to be a superhero.  It's a little Jimmy Norton segment.  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  My goal is to get Jim Norton to throw something.  It won't happen, though.  I know.  I know.  Do you realize that I'm in such a...  Today's 26 years sober for me.  February 1st, my anniversary.  Congratulations.  But I'm saying it's amazing that I'm in a creepy mood on a day that I should be... 
[01:27:30]  Celebrating.  Because I think all those thoughts come front and center when it's an anniversary, don't you think?  Yeah, yeah.  You tend to want to sabotage it, but I won't.  26 years.  26 years.  Oh, my God.  Imagine how awful it would be if one morning we're sitting here and Jim comes in all fucking drunk.  I'd be like, oh, no.  At this point, he just can't.  It happens.  No.  But you'd know because I'd come in late and you guys would be talking.  Yeah.  And you'd go, hey, and I would just kind of like...  Oh, no. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  That's the look.  The head down, looking like...  The pile on the toilet look.  The top of his eyes.  Kind of like, yeah, yeah, private pile on the toilet.  Dude, that is a scary look.  Is that how you look?  And then it's like, Jimmy, are you okay?  Yeah.  Jimmy, are you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  Something...  You seem sick or something.  I'm just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, that sucks.  I would literally start crying. 
[01:28:30]  I would fucking feel so bad.  I would remove...  I'd give you fucking everything.  Oh, my God.  I would remove myself from the situation.  Oh, God.  I'd run out of this studio.  I would run.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, have you...  When's the last time I got a fucking thank you?  Jimmy, we appreciate you, obviously.  Fuck you, your ass!  Your ass.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  What?  Yeah, I don't fucking... 
[01:29:00]  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What, now?  Now you fucking care?  Where was the fucking caring?  Holy shit.  What have I done in the past that showed that I wasn't caring about you?  Or whatever you're doing.  Who the fuck is Kenny?  Why?  He doesn't give a fuck, either.  Why do you want Kenny, Jimmy?  I want fucking coffee. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Oh.  Oh, he's got his coffee.  What the fuck are you filming?  Just because I've never seen you act like this, we're concerned, Jimmy.  We don't give a fuck.  No one gives a fuck about him.  We don't fucking care.  I hate that no one gives a fuck about me.  What do you fucking care?  I think we've proven we care.  Yeah, fucking.  Where's Gary?  Fuck him. 
[01:30:00]  You were that guy.  I so.  If it wasn't a big deal, I would love to do this for you.  Oh, my God.  No, it would be the saddest thing.  Yeah, it would be sad.  I do want to say that, but holy fuck.  You were not the fun guy?  Look at the look.  No, you're the fucking fun guy, remember?  Oh.  I don't even want to play act with him.  It's so fucking, I've seen this in other people, and it's a part of Jim that, like, you can't even imagine. 
[01:30:30]  Well, you fucking act like you never overslept.  So what?  It's 7.30?  I know.  Fucking Dracula called me.  Cocksucker.  Oh, God.  Where were you last night?  Fucking home.  Oh, yeah?  Feel all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  What were you drinking? 
[01:31:00]  What were you drinking last night?  Oh, fucking no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And then the crying start.  Fucking no.  This would be so fucking difficult to sit through.  I would never sit through this.  You all right, Jimmy?  Fuck you.  I'm fine.  You sure?  You don't sound fine.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone's saying, oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe Fez is drunk every day.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Fez.  Get married.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's getting married.  Yeah.  You guys fucking care about that?  But we don't care about...  You didn't make any prank calls or anything when you were drinking last night, did you?  Oh, man.  Fuck, man.  My phone was on.  I think so.  Who'd you call?  Scott. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, God.  You talking about the president of this company?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You called him?  What'd you say to him?  I don't know.  It was just...  I was just talking about how he doesn't care.  What'd he say to you?  I just heard...  Boop.  Did he hung up on you?  No, I left a message.  Oh, wow.  I don't fear.  Well, people are wondering...  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock. 
[01:32:30]  Fuck, he's...  Fuck, Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Fucking Mongo?  I wouldn't be able to deal.  No fucking way.  What is he fucking Mongo now?  It's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  Get fucked.  Get fucked.  Look, dude, dude, you gotta calm down a little bit.  I'm calm.  Dude, I'm fucking perfectly fucking calm.  Don't throw us right the fuck out of here.  You gotta calm the fuck down.  You gotta calm down a little bit, right?  I'm fine.  You alright?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time. 
[01:33:00]  Jimmy.  I thought yesterday was Sunday, so I fucking...  I'm here now.  Well, that happens.  It's fucking Tuesday.  Yeah, yeah, that happens.  You just gotta chill the fuck out, though, man.  Fine, dude.  They're listening down the hall.  You alright?  Yeah.  Alright.  Yeah.  We understand.  We've had a few.  You could just be happy, though, right?  You could be fun.  I'm happy.  Have some fucking fun.  I'm fine.  Dude, I'm fucking fine.  Why are you like...  Why is fucking Lady Gaga getting sued? 
[01:33:30]  That would be something that would really be important.  What the fuck, man?  I don't know.  It's something to do with her old assistant, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, 26 years.  Of what?  26 years sober and you fucking blow it.  I don't get it.  Fucking...  Who adds?  Who fucking counts anymore, man?  Who cares? 
[01:34:00]  What's the number, right?  It doesn't fucking matter.  Yeah.  You're not gonna drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Who fucking cares?  You look like you're gonna be sick.  I feel sick.  Oh, no.  How many drinks?  I didn't drink.  You said you drank.  I'm just tired.  Oh, just tired.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm doing the same thing you're fucking doing.  I'm looking for a fucking ending to this bit. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, that was...  The worst part of that is the look.  Oh, I know.  You knew how to look.  Mm-hmm.  Did you look like that?  Yeah.  I was really...  I was a...  Monumentally unpleasant...  Now, of course, that was like an exaggeration, almost like a Brewer character, but...  Yeah, but...  I mean, that does capture...  Were you never a happy drunk?  Never.  Even in the beginning?  Like, some people, they start out a little bit like a happy drunk.  First drink or two, I was fucking, you know, I was then... 
[01:35:00]  Charlie Cheery.  But then by fucking drink three, I was Dan Dreery.  And by fucking drink five, I was Oscar obnoxious.  And by...  I wish I looked like a superhero.  Oh, you do, Jimmy.  You've lost so much weight.  It looks so good.  You want to be a superhero.  What kind of superhero, though?  I don't know.  A lot to choose from.  I would just go around helping people.  Yeah.  Yes.  Grocery man.  Grocery man.  Like, if you have too many groceries, I would zip it and carry them up for you.  Grocery man?  He's very helpful. 
[01:35:30]  Like, there's a woman walking, and she doesn't realize that her lettuce is falling out.  Uh-huh.  And her lettuce falls out of the bag.  And all of a sudden, you...  And I fly, and I catch her lettuce.  And I place it back in her bag.  And I say, there you are, ma'am.  And what does she say?  Oh, thank you, grocery man.  Of course.  I zip away.  Thank you, grocery man.  I fly away.  And it's a blurb on page 26 of the paper.  Grocery man.  Grocery man.  But meanwhile, I'm flying over and around rapes and child kidnappings, and I'm ignoring 
[01:36:00]  them to help someone.  Like, I'll zip into, like, the Whole Foods.  And just as the guy is about to put the heavy milk on top of the eggs, I grab the milk out  of his hand.  And I say, son, look at the bottom of that bag.  And he'll say, oh, grocery man, thank you.  I forgot there were eggs in there.  Wow.  Don't put that on the eggs, I'll say.  And all of a sudden, I go...  And I've got a plastic bag out, and I put his milk in it. 
[01:36:30]  And I fly away.  Do you bag groceries for old people real quick?  Yes, I do.  They have to do it themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, the old lady is paying, oh, my arthritis is bothering me.  And she's looking at all the groceries pile up off that little conveyor belt.  And then she pays, and you're...  And all of a sudden, I'm there, and I give her the salute, and all her bags are in the  cart.  Wow.  And I say, have a safe trip home, ma'am.  Oh, thank you, grocery man.  I fly out.  Yeah, and you fly out. 
[01:37:00]  You don't help her get home?  And there's somebody getting fucking robbed in the parking lot.  Yes, there is.  Pistol whipped.  Yes.  A gentleman of color is taking the butt of his gun and caving it into the nose of another  old woman.  But since she has no groceries, I allow that.  I allow that to happen.  Grocery man is the worst.  You have a code.  Yes, yes.  Yes, I'm only here to help with groceries.  Yeah.  Does that want to do well at the box office?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's the one scene where the woman is walking with her groceries, and in slow motion, you 
[01:37:30]  see the handle break.  Oh, shit.  That'll happen, yeah.  And the groceries begin tumbling.  Oh, man.  And meanwhile, I'm somewhere, and you see me look up.  You can sense that.  I sense the groceries are falling, and then I jump out the window, and I change into my  outfit as I'm falling, and I fly down with a fresh bag, and I catch all of her groceries  before they hit the ground.  That's pretty quick.  Yeah.  And I just put them in her bag, and I go, here you are, ma'am, and I take the other bag.  No littering. 
[01:38:00]  I'm going to fly away.  That's pretty good.  Yes, it is.  Is there a scene in the movie where something happens to you, and you're not available,  and somebody's groceries maybe fall out of the back of their truck while they're loading  it up?  And it's like...  And then everybody stops and looks.  And they're like, where's Grocery Man?  Yes.  You see milk.  It's in the slow motion.  The milk hits the sidewalk, and the milk splatters in slow motion.  Oh, boy.  And everyone stops.  Like, traffic stops, and they all just look at the milk. 
[01:38:30]  And they know Grocery Man is injured.  Injured.  Mama, we're Grocery Man.  Grocery Man, pick up Grocery.  And I'm wearing my...  Pick up Grocery.  My Grocery Man outfit is like a green cape, but it's the consistency of lettuce.  This is terrible.  No, it's not.  Do you have a symbol?  Um...  Oh, yeah.  Yes, a symbol.  Is there like a grocery symbol when there's trouble?  Yes, there is. 
[01:39:00]  Like, uh...  It'll just be a tipped-over bag with items falling out.  Oh, wow.  Is that on your chest?  No.  On my chest is a paper bag with two healthy handles and a smile on the front, which signifies  happy groceries inside.  Grocery Man will come.  I fucking hate Grocery Man.  Why?  He's helpful.  He's not helpful.  Yes, he is.  He's so...  Not helpful.  Yes, he is.  He flies in a lot of times.  Like, somebody will be going to take an item off the shelf that's past the expiration date. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, wow.  And as they go to put it in their cart, all of a sudden, whoosh, it flies by and it's  out of their hand.  What if there are a bunch of bad grocery things happening at one time?  He just fucking is that quick.  Wow.  I go everywhere.  He just take care of everything.  He's just fucking that quick.  And they go to put something into the car past the expiration and he snatches it out of  their hand.  Wow.  Do you chastise people for leaving their carts, like, across the aisle when you're  trying to fucking get through?  Yeah.  And they're looking for some stupid shit, but they block the whole fucking aisle? 
[01:40:00]  So there's a...  I'm telling you the climax.  There's a scene where there's a guy pushing carts and he's got like 50 carts, but there's  a car coming.  Oh, wow.  And he doesn't see the cart guy.  Oh, shit.  And Grocery Man flies in and lands right in front of the car and puts his hand up in  the stop motion.  Oh.  And the car stops.  And then he waves the carriage guy across the street.  Oh, my God.  What an insignificant hero. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, it doesn't even sound like you're a nemesis.  You're just helping people.  Those nemesis are probably E-Rock who wants to eat all the groceries.  No, my nemesis is expiration dates.  Oh, wow.  And poorly packed grocery bags.  That's my nemesis.  There are many nemeses of mine.  And I must stop them all in all lands.  I don't think this would gross as much as Iron Man 3.  This would.  Yeah?  I'm putting it head to head.  Grocery Man 1.  Iron Man stinks. 
[01:41:00]  Against Iron Man 3?  Yes.  Grocery Man flies around and helps everyone with their groceries.  Who are you thinking to play Grocery Man for the big movie?  Moi.  You?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  I am Grocery Man.  That's amazing.  Especially with my new physique.  Yeah, I'd go.  Is there a love interest to get the female audience?  Oh, yeah, there should be a love interest.  There's got to be.  Come on.  Yes.  She's the only one who knows your identity.  Grocery Man's got a really weird love interest. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no.  No, go ahead.  No.  Her name is Betsy.  Oh, Betsy.  Betsy.  Yes, and she has cerebral palsy.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's safe.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I read out of improv.  No, no.  I'll tell you why.  Because he met her because of her cerebral palsy.  She was always dropping groceries.  Oh, and that's something Grocery Man hates.  Yeah, so he just, he began, and he fell in love with her after he helped her. 
[01:42:00]  She dropped another can of peaches.  Why peaches?  Every day.  She likes peaches.  She loves peaches because they're just fun to hold with her fucked up hands.  Yeah.  And she dropped the can on the bone of her foot, and she was like, ah, and the Grocery  Man flew in.  Saved her.  Yes.  Helped her out.  Yes.  That's nice, Grocery Man.  And then he made love to her violently while she laid on her side. 
[01:42:30]  Grocery Man has no ethics.  Her hand was propped up stiffly like a praying mantis hand.  Grocery Man, it's not against his ethics to use his Grocery Man status to get laid.  No, what he does is, is like when a woman, he takes his lettuce cape, and he covers their  face with it, and he violently makes love to them.  Violently?  Yes, Betsy with cerebral palsy.  Yeah.  His gal.  Yes.  She's 52.  That's his lowest. 
[01:43:00]  She's an older lady.  52?  52, yeah.  It's going to be a hit with all the kids.  This will not fucking gross 10 bucks.  You don't think this will be a hit?  No.  You know what would happen if this is going to be such a big hit that the headline is  going to read, Grocery Man, G-R-O-S-S dance.  Oh, yeah, for the gross.  Yeah, the big box office gross.  What is the box office gross?  Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes, not in this movie.  Ah, yes, eh?  Oh, boy.  How did Grocery Man first find out he had these powers? 
[01:43:30]  When he was a boy.  When he was just a baby, his mother was running around, futzing around, and something fell  off the shelf.  Yeah.  She was making some baby food, and she screamed, ah!  Here's the baby food was falling, and his little fat baby hand caught it.  Oh.  Grocery Man caught it and held it up like, mama!  And she looked all like, oh my God, you were in the other room.  What happened?  Yeah.  Grocery.  That was his first.  His first word was grocery. 
[01:44:00]  His little fat hand.  Grocery.  This is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  It's a fucking hit.  No.  It's not a hit.  It is.  The worst is yet to come.  This is O&A's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  On the O.P. and Anthony channel.  It's the final weekend of the NFL regular season.  Throws to Decker in the end zone.  Touchdown, Denver.

[01:48:30]  Worst of 2013, O.B.  Anthony's show.  My name is E-Rock, and we're up to part three of the Trace Adkins-Pen Gillette saga that's going on here.  Now we have Trace Adkins finally in studio.  We found some incredible stories about him, so we needed to talk to him.  Also joining us is Colin Quinn and Tom Papa.  And Trace comes in, talks to the celebrity apprentice, talks about his life, talks about his ice cream, of course.  And then for some reason Guy Fieri shows up.  I don't remember what it was.  Anyway, here it is, Trace Adkins.  O.B.  Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[01:49:00]  On the O.B.  Anthony channel.  Trace Adkins.  Here comes the Magnolia Bakery treats.  Those are so beautiful.  Yes.  That's not Trace Adkins.  No.  Is that the wife that shot him?  Should we not bring that up?  Oh, God damn.  Hi, I'm Trace Adkins.  There he is, Trace.  Trace Adkins.  Take a seat over here.  Pull up a mic.  We're on the air live.  We just do this.  Look at the voice.  There's the voice.  They told me y'all were, so.  Oh, yeah?  God damn, Trace Adkins.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:49:30]  We're really good.  You have mitts on him, too.  I know.  Do you know Colin Quinn?  Stop holding my hand, Quinn.  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Back in the day.  You guys know Trace?  No.  No, but I'm a fan.  I'm a fan of Colin Quinn.  And Tom Papa to your right.  Hey, Trace.  He's good friends with the Jerry Seinfeld.  That's his claim.  No, I mean.  He's acting with Michael Douglas in a new movie.  The Liberace movie.  The Liberace movie.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I'll brag for my pal Tom Papa. 
[01:50:00]  Thank you.  Do you want to see if Trace or any of his buddies down there are going to go see that Liberace movie?  Hell no.  Hells no.  I'm probably not.  Trace, we had a Pendulet in here yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  And he was pitching his ice cream.  You know, Apprentice, a celebrity all-star, friggin' amazing Apprentice this season.  You guys are head-to-head now.  Yeah.  So, now the object is to sell this ice cream.  Yes.  At this point.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  How do you feel you're doing?  I'm doing great.  I got a little pint of Penn's ice cream yesterday.  I found a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit.  It was a booger right on the top.  Oh, shit.  It was a booger on the top of it.  So, his ice cream has boogers in it, I'm just telling you.  That could be detrimental to ice cream sales.  At least I tried to disguise mine with macadamia nuts.  So, if something falls in there during production, people think it's a macadamia.  That's a good strategy.  But his just has boogers. 
[01:51:00]  But we've got to explain to Trace.  We're really good friends with Pendulet.  He does the show a lot.  But then we kind of started looking into your history, and we're all in.  We're hoping you win this thing.  We're like Penn is sunk.  Because your back story is way better than Pendulet's.  Absolutely.  As far as country artists go, you fit that bill that everyone has stereotyped over the years of taking tragedy and turning it around.  Pulling yourself up by the proverbial bootstraps, as they say.  Well, I suppose so.  That's why I think I've written one positive love song in my life. 
[01:51:30]  And I was commissioned to write that one.  And I think that's about it.  Now, you came up as a working guy.  You know, you worked in real...  I worked in oil field for 10 years.  Oil field.  I worked offshore on a drilling rig for six years, roughneck, worked derrick.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's a real job.  That's how I cut my finger off.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, we read you cut your finger off.  Yeah, I cut that one off.  It was then...  Right off.  It's permanently at 90 degree angle. 
[01:52:00]  They put it back on.  They put it back on, but it's bent like that.  The doctor asked me, he said, it's not going to work anymore.  I think I can save it, but how do you want it?  You want it straight?  And I said, no.  I said, put it in a sus position.  So now you can play.  I said, at least I can suspend a D or a G, you know.  I said, put it in a sus position.  He went, excuse me?  I showed him with my other hand.  I said, dude, like that.  That's having some forethought.  Well, dude, no, not really.  Because, I mean, the second that I cut it, that was the first thing I thought. 
[01:52:30]  Well, there goes my guitar playing.  You know, I knew it was pretty much over at that point.  Wow.  There's no way he's seeing Liberace.  No, no.  No, it's not.  No.  Wait, you worked in those oil rigs like off the coast and stuff?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's where the offshore ones are, Carl.  Yeah, I worked in the Gulf.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I hung out to dry there.  I'm sorry, Colin.  I didn't mean to.  I told Colin I'd be nice to him.  When another guest was in.  And by the way, as Bobby Kelly pointed out to me, it was always funny to me when it  was Voss or Bobby Kelly. 
[01:53:00]  Then it was me.  Then I was like, oh, this is not funny at all.  That's true.  Man, that thing you and Seinfeld did a while back was brilliant.  Oh, thanks.  Damn.  Absolutely brilliant.  The one-man show?  That was brilliant.  He's got a new one that we saw last night that was great.  Great.  I'll bust it out.  I want it.  That's great.  I'm all over it.  I'm in.  And he does do a great day.  Barrow Street Theater.  What are your, I could probably guess, but your political affiliations as far as things  that are going on in the news these days, what I say is the dismantling of the Constitution. 
[01:53:30]  Do you get involved in much of that?  Well, I don't get involved in it.  You know, I don't.  And people know that, too.  They come to my shows and they're not going to get beat over the head with any kind of  That's good.  I don't do that.  And I never have.  And I, you know what?  And I don't like people that do.  But at least, you know, some of the ones that do it, they're right up front with it.  And you know that going in, that you're going to get that.  I don't like to be ambushed by somebody.  Right, right, right.  But anyway, I'm a pretty conservative guy, sure.  Yeah.  You know, and what's going on right now, you know, I believe that when the government 
[01:54:00]  starts using agencies to persecute people that they have political and philosophical  differences with, that's tyranny, my friend.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  God damn, I got to agree.  And with that fucking voice saying it like that, that means business.  It makes you believe.  I agree.  Okay.  God, it's so nice.  It's so refreshing to see somebody in the business that we call show.  Right.  Well, I'm sure you heard something similar to that from Penn yesterday. 
[01:54:30]  Well, yeah, yeah, a little bit.  Penn, again, also doesn't really put himself out there politically that much.  Yeah, he is a libertarian.  He is a libertarian.  He's sort of a libertarian.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a quasi-libertarian.  And a libertarian is just a Republican who smokes dope.  That's true.  That's really true.  Do you go shooting and stuff?  Yeah, if there's something neat shooting.  No, very good, yeah.  I mean, I enjoy a little gunfire, but I go to the range, you know. 
[01:55:00]  There's not much going on.  Well, I do appreciate my Second Amendment right.  I've got a lot of guns.  I defend it to a public privilege.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have as many guns as he does.  I got a lot.  It's very difficult in New York, too.  He's got predated drones.  Well, I don't have a predated drone.  I want one of those.  He's got one.  I want a drone, man.  Well, no, I got a pretty big one with cameras on it and stuff.  I could send it up autonomously to patrol the neighborhood.  Awesome, awesome.  That's great.  I monitored some people getting a pizza delivery the other day.  It was a very exciting, very compelling video I got from that one. 
[01:55:30]  But, no, I really do.  And in New York, it's very difficult, as you probably know, to even say that you own guns.  But, no, I love it.  I picked up a Barrett .50 cal.  Man, they make those just right down the road from where I live in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  Oh, isn't that fantastic?  You ever fire one of those?  I have.  A lot of fun.  I don't have one yet.  I'm about to get one.  I just got a Desert Eagle .50 caliber.  I got one of those.  Oh, wow.  What a treat.  You take that down to the indoor range and fire it.  They won't.  At my indoor range, they won't let me shoot it. 
[01:56:00]  They won't?  No.  Over here in Nessau, they let me.  But you watch everybody from all the other slots.  They peek their head around like, what the hell?  Right, yeah.  Somebody's got a cannon.  Is he firing that?  You know what?  It's a .50 caliber pistol.  Yeah.  It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger one from that.  Yeah.  The guy that I got it from, you know, he said, dude, don't ever shoot anybody in your house with this.  It's not the most practical.  Wait until they go outside. 
[01:56:30]  It's going to ruin everything.  Because it will make a mess.  It's not the most practical gun to have, but it is a lot of fun.  I'm not worried about the killing.  I'm worried about the cleanup.  The mess.  You shoot a melon with that thing, and it just explodes.  It's fantastic.  It's fun to shoot.  Yeah, it is.  Is it heavy?  Yeah, it's heavy.  Very.  You put a full magazine in there, because the shells are really, really big.  You could bludgeon. 
[01:57:00]  So you could do some damage with just beating someone.  You don't have to shoot anybody.  You don't have to shoot the damn thing.  We've got to ask you, man.  Speaking of shooting, what we learned about yesterday, you got shot in the heart.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  How'd that happen?  The story is insane.  Really mad woman.  Yeah.  Really?  You know, and she had the pistol, and it was, I learned a very good life lesson from that.  I held my hand out like this, and I said, give me that pistol, or I'm going to take it 
[01:57:30]  away from you and beat your goddamn brains out with it.  Oh.  And she stuck it under my arm and pulled the trigger.  And the bullet went in here and came out here.  Wow.  It went straight across the chest cavity.  Went through both of my lungs.  Went through my arm.  Did you think that was it?  Because it's right in your chest.  You know, when something like that happens, you just, you know, you don't think.  You know, I just remember thinking that it was brand new Berber carpet, and I thought,  if I bleed on this carpet, she's going to shoot me again.  Holy Christ. 
[01:58:00]  So I went to a room that had tile floor and laid down there to die.  It's amazing what you think.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How close were you to dying?  Huh?  How close were you?  I don't know.  You know, they life-flighted me to the trauma center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,  and they saved my life.  Yeah.  Had it not been for that trauma center there, I wouldn't be here.  Did she call 911?  She did.  She did.  Yeah.  She did.  And he never pressed charges.  Well, I got a good, clean divorce out of the deal. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  You know what?  After my divorce, I would rather have been shot.  It would have been less painful.  Financially viable.  Because we're like, how do you not press charges?  Well, he answered that question.  That is a good...  It was cheaper.  That's a good chip to bring into the courtroom with you.  Oh, yeah.  And by the way, let's not forget.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, no, it didn't go to court.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That is something. 
[01:59:00]  You must have really pissed her off.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I really did.  Tom's taking her side.  I love it.  Hey, Trace, what'd you do?  Trace, I threw a message.  I said, just enjoy a muffin for McDonald's.  My body is covered with scars, and I deserved every one of them.  Every one of them, huh?  I'm not going to sit here and try to say anything.  An oil rig accident is rarely just, hey, someone got a Band-Aid over there.  It usually ends up being pretty...  Yeah, I got a scar here.  You know, I busted my ribs, and my elbows, I've had to operate on there because I'm jacking 
[01:59:30]  the pipe and the derrick, you know, and I wore my elbows out.  So I'm all used up, but, you know...  Was that good money at the time?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Better than what I make now.  I make hundreds of dollars a year now.  Fuck, man.  Oh, damn.  Were you playing music the whole time you were out there, or did that come up later?  No, yeah, I was playing guitar and trying to write stuff when I was out there. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, I started...  My old man got me guitar when I was 10.  I don't really know why he did it.  He didn't play.  So that's when I started.  Oh, wow.  And what was the big break there that got you off the rig?  My second wife wanted to move far away from my first wife, because they didn't get along  at all.  Yeah.  So we moved, and she said, let's move.  I can't stand her.  And I was like, okay, well, I don't really like her that much either. 
[02:00:30]  Where do you want to go?  And I said, let's just go to Nashville.  I said, you know, I like to sing and play, and maybe I can make something happen.  Were you knocking around the clubs over there in Nashville?  Yeah, I played clubs there for about three years.  You got a lot of bars.  I was working construction and playing.  You got to have a day gig in Nashville, too.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just got to play clubs the same way until someone notices?  Yeah, I played the club circuit in Texas for about five years.  In the southwest, Texas, New Mexico, you know, Oklahoma, I played that circuit for five 
[02:01:00]  years in the late 80s.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I did.  I really did enjoy it.  And it finally got to a point where I faced myself in the mirror one morning and said,  you know what?  Five years ago, I wouldn't even have hung out with somebody like you, because I'd gotten  really strung out.  And it was, you know, I had to get away from it, go back to the oil field to save my life.  Wow, really?  Wow.  Damn.  Too much partying.  That's some perspective.  That's what strung out means. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  For you from the Liberace movie.  Which one of you Nancys doesn't like maple in my ice cream, anyway?  Oh, boy, I don't know.  Who said that?  Sam, was that you?  Somebody said it.  Oh, Sam, saying he doesn't like maple.  Yeah, I don't know who said that, Trace.  That would be crazy to say in front of you.  We just assumed with everything you have going on in your life, you were probably head of  the Maple Producers Coalition or something.  Hey, let me write that down.  Yeah, write that down. 
[02:02:00]  We're all big fans of maple, right in.  Yeah, yeah.  We love maple.  This is where it starts.  Now, stop.  Trace, you're an oil rig guy, a badass, a ball fighter.  How the hell did you end up with maple macadamia mashup?  We're putting a stop to it today.  Okay.  We're putting a stop to it.  All right.  Let me tell you where I'm at in my life right now, man.  Yes.  I have prostitutes coming up to me going, dude, the shit you're doing for money is just, you  know what I mean?  How can you live with yourself? 
[02:02:30]  And I don't disagree.  I have no pride anymore.  You know what, though?  I'm just like Quinn.  We sold our dignity a long time ago.  And I sold mine cheap.  I don't know about him.  I got to say, though, the all-star apprentice ice cream here from Trace, the maple macadamia  mashup, proceeds going to the Red Cross, the American Red Cross.  See, that's pretty goddamn good right there.  You can't totally say you sold out. 
[02:03:00]  And then also, your Wounded Warrior Project work is amazing.  Well, that's been a privilege.  Absolutely, right?  You know, the association with them has just been something that has just been a humbling  experience for me.  I mean, I've been doing that for a few years now, and just a great organization.  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice.  I do, too.  You just told Penn that yesterday.  No, no.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  No, I said it after we looked at his backstory that we have to go with this guy.  I did say that. 
[02:03:30]  I changed my opinion, even though he's a really good friend of ours.  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too, man.  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon.  That's all he's got going for him.  How is the Midwest going to appreciate a magician with a sex dungeon?  Right.  We're going all American with this one.  I wonder what bars they go to when you work on the oil rigs.  Don't you guys have, like, a group of bars you go in, and you get into a little flack  with the local Corpus Christi?  Didn't you see Armageddon?  What's wrong with you?  No, I didn't.  Of course they do.  You didn't see Armageddon?  No.  A bunch of roughnecks out there in space?  I like those kind of movies.  Did you watch that, Trace? 
[02:04:00]  And just go, get out of here.  It was ridiculous.  I could have done that, stupid.  I could have done that.  No, it was one of the most ridiculous movies.  We've got Guy Fieri outside, too, so I don't know what to do.  Oh, Jesus.  I'll sit on the couch.  I saw him.  No.  I saw him the other day.  Oh, my God.  What are you guys doing?  Sheriff Colin, you can't do that.  I'm sitting right here.  That's Fury's manager.  That's a big, look how big that is.  That is a big son of a bitch right there.  He might be taller than you, Trace.  He is taller.  I met him yesterday.  He's taller than me.  Here's Guy Fieri.  Jerry, rock and roll, ACDC. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  For those about to rock, right on his fucking chest, baby.  What's up, Guy?  Yeah.  Good to see you, buddy.  You know, Trace?  I just met him the other day.  God, is he tall?  Yeah, he's tall.  Yeah, he's tall.  Yeah, your manager's pretty goddamn tall right there.  But he's not rocking a cowboy hat and boots.  Yeah.  He's in Nikes and a golf shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I saw him.  We met the other day.  And what a great guy.  And you've hit the tour, man.  You've been all over.  Well, you know, that's what they make you do when you have a new album come out. 
[02:05:00]  They make you go dance for Granny.  The girls were going nuts at that show the other day.  I can imagine.  Like, hey, I'm here.  I'm cooking.  I'm making some food.  You were cooking at one of his shows?  I should have been cooking at one of his shows.  It would have been.  We were doing one of the morning shows.  Oh, okay.  Pretty good time.  So we were standing out there grilling and talking about food and the whole thing.  And he's from Louisiana.  Knives.  We were talking about knives.  We were talking about knives.  You've got to respect the guy that's got his own line of cutlery.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were just looking at that. 
[02:05:30]  Knuckle sandwich knives.  That's all right.  Great names.  Flames on him.  Big sharp blade.  Like, Colin, great name for his knives.  Yes, indeed.  Guy, do you remember when we met?  Austin, Texas.  Really?  Colin?  Colin makes a face like, nah.  You recognize me.  He's in Texas.  He's so proud of himself that he remembered something.  He really is.  Did you see that?  That look on his face.  That was awesome.  He had a senior moment.  He's like, I remembered something.  Come on.  A senior moment.  Magnolia bakery treats, guy. 
[02:06:00]  CQ.  Who else?  Magnolia bakery treats.  He also switched spots for Tom Papa.  Yeah, I think Tom felt a little like, you know.  Tom should be on the couch, quite frankly.  No, I didn't.  I was like, Colin Quinn was to be up there.  But Guy and I go way back also.  I want an expert opinion.  Tom, try some of that ice cream.  I don't care if y'all try it.  I want him to try it.  Yeah, exactly.  He's an expert.  Yeah, guys, try the maple.  He's the expert.  What is this called?  Moonshine mashup?  See, I tell you, if there would have been a little moonshine in this, I think it's a 
[02:06:30]  great one.  Well, we know.  Yo, the mad Cuban's in here, too.  No, you're not.  The mad Cuban.  We love him.  He's a character.  You were the one who introduced us to him, and now he does our show.  It's very maple-y.  It has a butterscotch-y taste to it.  It's very good.  That is good.  It's pretty good.  Yeah, I know.  I hope you should try something.  Shut the front door.  You know, and I just thought, you know, Penn, he did, he went way out there and mixed vanilla  and chocolate.  Did you just call him out on that?  Yeah, I think so.  Did you just call him out on that? 
[02:07:00]  I did a maple macadamia, which my young lady, they called her an ice cream wizard.  She said that, as far as she knew, that hadn't been done.  I'll tell you, I had Penn's yesterday, and he's got salt in his.  He's got a sea salt.  He's got a little sea salt in it.  With salt and the counterbalance to the sugar.  I mean, it really plays nicely.  And he had big chunks of chocolate in it, kind of a bittersweet chocolate.  But I'm not a huge chocolate guy.  Oh.  This right here reminds me of, like, pralines and cream.  That macadamia that survives in there. 
[02:07:30]  A lot of times the nuts kind of get, you know, they kind of get crushed, and they're a little  soft, and they don't have any texture.  This has great texture.  It's not overly sweet.  You think maple, and I'm like, oh, boy, someone's going to go crazy with the Mrs. Butterworth.  But this has got a good balance, man.  She kept coming to me, and I would say, come on, give me some more maple.  And she kept cranking up the maple intensity.  I thought I may have gone a little too far with it.  You think it's all right?  It's almost too much.  Can you ship this to people's houses? 
[02:08:00]  Or can you only buy Dwayne Reed and his curses?  And Walgreens, yeah.  Is it only in New York they carry it?  No, it's everywhere.  I'm nationwide, dude.  National, right?  Nationwide.  Hell yeah.  Nationwide.  God damn, is that a great song.  Tell us about the new album that's coming out.  I got a new album out.  It's called Love Will, and it's just nothing but love songs.  I've never done that before.  Oh, yeah.  Love Will dot, dot, dot.  There you go.  Thank you, guy.  That's right there. 
[02:08:30]  Guy knows.  Did you do that?  The first time I'd ever done that.  We just started playing your songs yesterday.  I didn't set out to do it, really.  I thought I had the album done in August, and then this apprentice thing came up, and I  whored out and went and did that, so I couldn't come out in the fall with the album like I  thought I was going to, so we had to delay the release of it.  And in the meantime, I came up with a few more songs, and I recorded them, and then I realized  that I had 11 love songs.  I had about 18, 19 songs cut, and I thought, wow, 11 of these are love songs, so I'm just 
[02:09:00]  going to put out an album of love songs.  But it's not like a bread album.  I mean, don't think that it's that, because you've got to keep in mind I'm the guy that  thinks Badonkadonk is a love song.  Right, yes.  But I will say this, this album is a deal closer, you know, if you've got, and she's  not cooperating and spending the evening with her, put this album on and close the deal.  Sounds like Fast Times at Ridgefown. 
[02:09:30]  Or let her go.  Must have been somebody's baby.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's getting plowed again.  Every time that goddamn song came out.  It's your video.  So did anything change in your life where you're like, ah, love songs, let me jot a few  of these down?  No, you know, I don't, not consciously, I don't, but maybe there's something going on.  You know, I think, I don't want to get all into that stuff, man, but I suppose there's  a time in a man's life when he starts staring mortality in the face, and you know, and you 
[02:10:00]  start realizing.  What was that for you, like 10, based on your bio?  Holy shit.  No, I always thought I was indestructible, and now I kind of know that I'm not, so.  Yeah, that kind of sudden shot in the heart does that to a man.  Yeah, man.  Who said that?  Oh, the couch.  Oh, hi, Tom.  Tom, boy, Tom.  I'm relaxing on the couch.  I can't even see him at the kid table.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn, after watching his show last night, sitting on the 
[02:10:30]  couch.  I couldn't stand to see Colin Quinn.  I can't have the legend be on the couch.  You should have seen when Mark Cuban and Bill Burr was in the air, sitting on that couch.  It was ridiculous.  You were just being pounded.  That was terrible.  Now you're just name dropping Mark Cuban.  Wow.  If I had a fucking Desert Eagle that day, there'd be no Mark Cuban.  Oh!  Wow!  Damn.  And, of course, Guy, Guy Fieri, you have a book with, like, the longest title ever.  What is that?  Do I have to read all the signs?  No, don't read all the signs.  Oh, it's New York Times best-selling author, Guy Fieri. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, that's the first sign.  Then it goes to the next one.  And it's Diner's Drive-Ins, Dives, The Funky Finds in Flavortown.  And America's classic joints and killer comfort food includes behind-the-scenes stories and  jocularities from the Triple D crew and restaurant owners.  Cut me, Mick.  Cut me.  Wow.  Cut me, Mick. 
[02:11:30]  I'm going to use dot, dot, dot next time.  I swear.  That is, uh...  Listen, I don't know about these publishers.  Just put it in a search engine.  These publishers can get exactly...  That's exactly who it is.  Get every tagline, every phrase you can.  And what might be associated with it?  Oh, but another book, Guy.  Man.  I'll tell you what it is.  How many is this?  This is my fourth book, but my third Diner's book.  And we've done like 600 locations on Triple D.  And so people ask, like, you know, how do we find the places and get us a map and do this?  So we just eventually...  I mean, this is like two years later for the third book. 
[02:12:00]  So you could literally take a little trip, a little road trip, and stop in at some of these jerks?  In the back of it, it gives you the address and the website and all the...  Nice.  So we have people that are traveling.  I mean, I've run into folks when I'm out there doing the show that have done like 300, 400 locations.  I'm like, what are you...  Wow.  I mean, they've got like RV...  They're doing more locations than I am.  And then they're bringing me portfolios of other places I should try.  I'm like, no, no, no.  Get ahead of the wave.  I mean, just let me go at my own...  Hey, you know, we're doing this fall.  We're taking a bus trip, a tour bus from here, from New York, down to where are we in? 
[02:12:30]  Branson, Missouri.  Nashville.  We're going through Branson, because we have to check out, even though I think Yaakov's  not going to be there.  But you have to check out the Barry Williams 70s song, Explosion in Nevada.  It's a long story.  Was there a Yaakov Smirnoff reference in there?  I think Yaakov...  That's why we're going.  Seriously, did I just hear Yaakov Smirnoff?  Yeah, yeah.  I got a shock off.  That's why we're going.  He's got a diamond there.  I saw him in Vegas when I was in college.  Trace is just shaking his head.  What happened?  Hey, guy, I want to ask you something.  Yes, sir.  You know, the magazine's on airplanes, and they've got the list of the 10 best state houses in 
[02:13:00]  America.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I know.  But those people pay.  Do these people pay you to be in this book?  No, but jeez, you started getting WWF on me.  Just started pushing me.  Jesus, let me ask you a question.  Listen to me, brother.  I'm going to break you down.  All right, brother.  No.  Did you see how he turned around?  I'm like, no, yes, yes, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't think.  I kind of like seeing somebody fucking alpha male in your ass at some point.  God, you saw me.  Jesus, he turned the icebreaker right in his face. 
[02:13:30]  He's like, let me ask you something.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey.  Jesus, he turned around right in your face.  Man, I'll sush you.  I'll hook this suss in your nose, and you're in deep trouble, my friend.  No, we don't take any...  I'll sush hook you, man.  We don't take any bribes, as far as you know.  That's some weird good shit, Quinn.  I never even thought of that.  I'm going to sush hook you, boy.  All I know is he's going to gas somebody in the nose with it. 
[02:14:00]  I might have missed that beast.  Yeah.  We're going with Trace to win Celebrity Apprentice.  I might have to.  And Pendulet's a front part.  I don't know.  Boy, we are really...  Tell me about this road trip, by the way.  I want to hear about this.  I know.  We're just jumping on a bus.  So we're going to be stopping at a few places.  You know anywhere?  Where's a good place along the way?  Give us an example.  I will set up.  You guys just give me the itinerary.  I will set up the feeding zones. 
[02:14:30]  And we'll weigh you at the beginning of the event.  Like McCluskey.  And then we'll weigh you at Branson.  We'll put three of those Branson, Missouri buffets under your belt.  Nice.  You know, I hear Yakov's place.  Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  What happens is he gives you a real metal tray that has a magnet on the back.  And it sticks on the seat.  Because when you watch Yakov's Dinner Theater, it's in movie theater seats.  You're literally sitting in movie theater seats.  So they have magnets on the arm.  You click your metal tray.  But don't get discouraged. 
[02:15:00]  Genuine linen napkins.  Real silverware.  No, you get a spork.  I know you get a spork.  No, no.  This is what they actually pitch on the website.  They're advertising this shit.  That they have real linen napkins, real silverware, and a chicken cordon bleu.  Ooh.  Which I'm sure is just being pumped out of there like the chocolate on that Lucy conveyor belt.  Yeah.  They're going old school with that.  Yeah.  Jerry's Jubilee.  Jerry's Jubilee.  Right.  I want to bake the Lasker. 
[02:15:30]  We're very excited about that.  So how long will the trip take?  A week.  About a week.  We're just going to do Memphis.  Nashville.  Oh, we got some good.  I got some good food.  We're going to Austin.  I got great.  Austin, great food.  Memphis, great food.  Nashville, great food.  I got a barbecue joint right outside of Nashville.  Can we just walk in and go, Caffieri sent us rock and roll.  Ooh.  Pew, pew, pew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're going to try to set it up to that degree.  Like case and shit.  No, I'm not.  This will be good stuff.  How many people in your crew?  What's your policy going to look like?  Oh, man.  Winnebago.  Hey.  Is this going to be like rubber ducky convoy? 
[02:16:00]  Not including the broads that we're going to get on the bus.  The broads.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, sure.  Because you know they're asleep by fucking 930 at night.  The posse didn't look like.  You ever seen that?  See the stuff at the gas station?  And one flew over the Cooper's neck.  That's my thing.  It's going to look like convoy, you know, with all these dilapidated rigs behind you.  Yeah.  It's going to be pretty shitty.  People flashing you when they drive by on the bus.  I'm hoping to get maybe a couple of CBs so we can talk to each other.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  CBs would be a nice touch.  Buddy.  I was the wrangler.  Are you going to bring the hardware? 
[02:16:30]  That's right.  What?  Are you going to bring the hardware?  I don't think I can bring my piece.  Why not?  Eh, you cross state lines.  Everything's fucked up.  It's not Smokey and the Bandit.  You can't do that.  I had one on the bus one time.  I forgot about it.  It was in my nightstand by my bed.  And then we crossed the border going into Canada.  And they put me in jail.  Oh, they did lock you up?  Yeah, they locked me up for six hours.  They locked me up for about six hours.  Shouldn't they know?  How do they come on and handcuff you is what I want to know.  No shit.  Well, I just...  You six get on there and get him.  No, I copped to it immediately because it was like border crossing trainee day. 
[02:17:00]  And so they were just like going through everything.  Oh, man.  So I immediately said, okay, wait.  I forgot about something.  And then I told them where it was.  And then they just...  Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.  Shouldn't they take things like that into consideration and know that it's like, look, it's Trace  seconds, he's not going to fucking be blasting off in Canada with this gun.  It was an honest mistake.  You know, as opposed to somebody you know is trying to commit some kind of real crime.  It was weird.  And then when they gave me my pistol, it was a little .380 automatic.  It wasn't a big deal. 
[02:17:30]  But they handed it back to me and they had completely disassembled it.  So it was just all in pieces.  Kept souvenir parts.  And I had to walk back across the border and mail it home.  They wouldn't let me drive back across.  Wow.  Wow.  So now do you have a weapons charge on you in Canada or something?  No.  But that's why they really got mad because I had a weapons charge here.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I like the fact that every question Trace answers is like another story.  Really? 
[02:18:00]  This leads to another whole Pandora's box.  I love it, man.  We were shipping the Camaro we use for Triple D across the border and I'd just been at a,  it just was at Kid Rock's place doing a shoot for people.  Oh, God.  And we loaded it up.  We loaded it up.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You don't like the beer or you don't like Rock?  They found guns and dope and women in the trunk of the car.  So we loaded it up.  He makes this great beer.  He makes this great beer.  And we had it on the show and I wanted to take some back to California.  So I threw it in the trunk of my Camaro. 
[02:18:30]  Well, I just happened to forget the Camaro was on its way to Canada.  So I get a call from this driver stressing out, there's beer in the back of your car.  Where the hell did that come from?  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, shit.  But they actually, they let it go.  They let the car come into Canada, cruise around with the 10 cases and cruise back out.  Oh, okay.  Did they know it was there?  No weapons charge.  No weapons, yeah.  You got to watch that.  I hate the fact that, you know, you go from one state to another and you're fucking, your  gun's good here.  It's not good here.  You're responsible and we trust you and you went through all the hoops here.  Like in New York, you got to go through so much. 
[02:19:00]  I should be able to cover every goddamn state in the Union.  But, you know, I can't drive across Jersey unless it's in a locked box, separate from the ammo.  You're not stopping until you get to Pennsylvania.  You know, shit like that.  Which is really stupid because then if someone steals the car, instead of the gun being on  you where you have possession of it and know where it is and it's not going to get in anyone  else's hands, now someone's got your gun and your car.  The laws make no sense.  They punish the law-abiding citizen, do nothing to make anyone safer. 
[02:19:30]  Where is this coming from?  I've never heard you talk like this before.  Exactly, Carl.  Do you know what?  A New Yorker just got arrested because of the new law that only allows seven rounds in  your magazine and he had ten because he had a ten-round mag.  Right, right, right.  And he got pulled over.  He had a pistol on his seat, a Stady, pulled him over and looked, saw the gun.  The guy says, yes, I completely legal.  I got this.  The trooper checked the magazine, found that there were, you know, three more too many bullets  or two.  I think it was a nine-round mag that he had. 
[02:20:00]  It was only two extra bullets and arrested him.  And now the guy's got a weapons charge on him because of that.  How did that make anyone any safer?  How did that law just make New York a safer place to live because a guy that legally owns  a gun, has all the permit, had two bullets too many in his magazine?  The laws are ridiculous.  Talk your boy Cuomo.  Yeah, well, he's the gun charge I had was a similar kind of thing.  It wasn't, I wasn't doing anything illegal.  How did it? 
[02:20:30]  I had a pistol and it was in the pocket of the door of my truck.  And at the time I didn't have a permit, carry permit.  But anyway, so the pistol was there in the door and it was loaded, of course.  And I got pulled over for something else and the guy looks and he goes, is that gun loaded?  And I said, is your gun loaded?  Yes, it's loaded.  You know?  I carried some paperweight.  There are two useless things in this world, a dull knife and an empty gun, you know?  So, he said, assume the position and took me directly to jail. 
[02:21:00]  But that's my gun charge.  I mean, I didn't, you know, I didn't like it.  What state was that?  What state was that?  That was Tennessee.  Tennessee, wow.  Now I have a carry permit to Tennessee.  In Tennessee.  So they're all cool with it.  If you hook up, like, fucking Ted Nugent, they, like, deputize him and he could carry anywhere in the country.  A bazooka.  You gotta get that.  I like the fact that Trace doesn't think he's getting arrested.  He's like, hey, officer, there's two useless things in this world.  A dull knife and an unloaded gun. 
[02:21:30]  Instead of going, it's loaded, sir, but I'm on my way.  Where'd you celebrate?  Fuck you.  You're not gonna do nothing about it.  It's loaded.  No, he did.  He asked me, he said, is that gun loaded, sir?  And I said, hell, is your gun loaded?  You know what I mean?  Come on, man.  Yes, loaded.  Absolutely.  Why would you have a loaded gun?  What, I look like I'm in a Liberace movie.  Hey, I got caught stealing bubble.  And they put me in the back and my dad had to come get me. 
[02:22:00]  Wow, that is frightening.  Hard time.  Trace has lived the life here, man.  The whole, the work ethic, the getting hurt on a real man's job.  Right.  The country music star.  Weapons charges.  Jesus Christ.  It's fantastic.  Are we gonna tell Pendulet that we're not rooting for him anymore?  I know.  Should we call him?  We've already told him.  I'm all about, I'm all in with Trace now.  Yeah.  And this is fantastic.  Yeah, look.  It's trying to ice cream.  Oh, now it's a little mushy.  See, it's wonderful.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:22:30]  We probably should take a break.  You know what?  Get Trace out.  I gotta go anyway.  This should be good on Waffles.  This should be great on Waffles.  I gotta go to Atlantic City and hang out with my peeps.  Atlantic City, where do you stay when you go there?  I don't stay anywhere there.  I go.  I go there and they give me money and I leave.  Oh, okay.  I gotta go do a show tonight at Caesars there.  Caesars in AC.  Can we play one of your new songs?  That'd be cool.  I didn't come over here just to talk to you.  No, we're gonna do it, though. 
[02:23:00]  He throws a smack down.  No matter what he says, you're that close from getting punched in the face.  He is a very intimidating guy.  Authentic.  Say no to a woman or watch the world end?  Say no to a woman, I guess.  All right, we're gonna do that for today.  Watch the world ends.  It was a really sappy love song I did with Colby Calais.  It's beautiful, but it's not good for this show.  You know, I don't think any...  Nothing beautiful is good for this show.  I don't know if any of the songs on this album are good for this show.  You should go back and do something off one of my other albums. 
[02:23:30]  Whoop a man's ass or something like that.  We played Arlington yesterday.  Oh, did you?  That's a cheerio.  What the fuck?  A lot of people commented that they were balling.  Yeah, that's a tear-jerker, that song.  And we played another one.  What was the other one?  Honky-tonk-ba-donk-a-donk-a-donk.  No, we played that.  Of course.  Well, that's a love song.  That's pretty sensitive.  Of course it is.  I mean, especially when the money-maker line comes by.  You know, it really brings a tear.  What was the third one we played?  As a father of five daughters, that one really...  Oh, shit.  You got five daughters?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  Good luck with that.  You know, people say, well, why do you have five daughters?  Because I wanted to have one son.  And after the fifth one, I didn't even leave the hospital.  I just walked down and I said, dude, you've got to do something about this, man.  That's it, huh?  That was it.  Oh, man.  Wow.  How old are they?  How old are the girls?  28, 24, 15, 11, and 8.  All right.  So you've had to deal with guys coming around. 
[02:24:30]  All of them, yeah.  How is that for a dad?  I've never had a problem with it.  Some of my likes.  Of course.  You're 6'4".  Hello.  Man, that would suck.  What part?  Man, you meet a girl, you're liking her and stuff, and it's like, oh, let me introduce  you to my dad.  Oh, yeah.  Who is it?  Oh, yeah.  By the way, my dad's Trace Hank, and you're like, oh, my God, he's giant.  He doesn't put up with shit.  Yeah.  He wants to wrestle you in the backyard.  Yeah, right.  Just don't fucking stay away from his pinky.  Put it in your nose. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, don't let him sus-hook you.  Oh, my God, King, he's going for the sus-hook.  That's going to be my wrestling go-to move, man.  I'm going to do some WWE, man.  There it is.  There you go.  Go to the sus-hook.  Trace, thanks so much for coming in.  Absolutely.  What a pleasure, man.  It was a pleasure to meet you guys.  It was a lot of fun.  I've been a fan for a long time.  It's great, man.  Thanks, man.  Colin Quinn.  Wow.  Colin.  Pleasure, Jason.  Thank you.  Liberace.  Liberace in the corner.  Tom Papa.  Guy for the head.

[02:30:30]  In this segment here, we welcome Courtney Love to the show.  Courtney has not been on the show, to my recollection, but she came in.  Jim Florentine was also in studio.  We talked to her about, well, we didn't really know what to expect with Courtney Love coming in studio.  But, of course, we're going to talk to her about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana and Dave Grohl and all those things that she's been dealing with.  But she also talks a little bit about Anthony Kiedis.  And we try to get to the bottom of this rumor that she might be hosting American Idol.  Let's find out.  O&A's Worst of 2013.  What do you think of Amanda Bynes? 
[02:31:00]  You tweeted her recently.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  That thing.  I think she likes the word ugly a lot.  Yeah, she uses that for everybody.  It's like, what's that about?  Listen, I was 14.  I was so bloody ugly.  And I thought I was Kate Moss.  I chased this guy named Mark Rennie, who was the hottest photographer in Portland around, convinced him.  I've got to show you guys these pictures.  They're so ugly.  You know, I had this big schnoz.  And I had, like, blusher on like this.  And I'm wearing white gloves and black and white things. 
[02:31:30]  And I'm like this, like making new wave faces.  Oh, nice.  And, like, voguing.  And I am so fucking homely.  And I think I'm in a gap in my teeth.  And I thought I was the hottest thing in the world.  And I was 180 pounds.  Wow.  So if someone calls me ugly, it sort of rolls off my back.  Because, like, it's not about looks.  It's about attitude.  I mean, you get laid on attitude.  But didn't you think that was kind of shitty?  Because you kind of, like, you didn't say anything bad to her.  No, what I said back to her is you misunderstood me. 
[02:32:00]  And...  Well, your tweet was, get it together, dude, I think.  No, the first was tweet.  Something like that?  Get it together, dude, because you're so crazy.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  The wig and the this and that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And marijuana isn't a drug.  Come on.  And clearly, marijuana is a drug.  At least other drugs.  And then there's this whole thing about, like, Disney kids just, like, they're not educated.  Look at how she writes.  You know, I'm not educated either, but I'm at least autodidactic.  At least I try and read Flabert.  Do you know what I mean?  To pronounce it correctly. 
[02:32:30]  And they have no parental infrastructure.  And they just get it, like, after they're not nubile anymore or useful, they're sort  of waylaid.  They just lose it.  Yeah.  And then we all pick on them.  She comes up.  She comes up as a low bump.  And enjoy it.  Well, we love a train wreck.  Yeah, but it's like, don't model your thing on Lohan, man.  Like...  Right.  Yeah.  And we do look at it.  Until something tragic happens, and then everybody's like, oh, you know, she should have had help  and this.  But meanwhile, everyone was piling on the dog pile like that. 
[02:33:00]  You're going to call them out.  You know, I did the Billboard Awards once, and I refused to lip sync, and it was a huge  mistake.  Oh, really?  Why?  Yeah, because there's, like, this little delay, because I thought it was just...  Can I say...  I thought it was gay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Homosexual fans, I love you.  I do say gay sometimes, okay.  I thought it was just lame, and we actually sounded worse.  Wow.  Because they were doing AccuTuning back then and whatever.  And I think Kid Rock said something on the Billboard Awards about people that lip sync. 
[02:33:30]  But he's got to lip sync.  We all lip sync now.  Yeah.  On those shows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You sound like shit.  Oh, man.  That's kind of...  But why is the sound like shit?  Why can't they get that sound?  I don't know.  Like, do a sound check early in the day.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It does suck, though.  Have you ever heard the Chili Peppers without Anthony's voice AccuTuned?  Oh.  Not going there.  Sorry.  AccuTuned is something they do live?  Is that like...  No, no, no.  They can do it live, but it's where, if you're hitting flats and sharps, they can...  It rounds it up to where it's supposed to be. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Puts it where it's supposed to be.  It's what they did with Mary J. Blige's voice, in my opinion.  And Mary J. Blige had this fantastic, phenomenal, soulful, wounded, great voice.  And lately, what I hear is really AccuTuned.  Yeah.  And it's like, Barbie, where are you?  And have you used that?  For me?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  I'm white.  You know, I don't hear it. 
[02:34:30]  You like it?  You like it?  No!  You're not going to do that.  But the live shows you do, it's all real.  You don't use any of that stuff.  Yeah, of course.  But Anthony Kiedis doesn't sound great live, huh?  If you take that away?  I would say, without insulting one of my oldest friends who let me use his rehearsal space  before I even had a band, therefore I wouldn't even be here without Flea, that Anthony's voice  is slightly banal without a little something-something, like reverb or something about it. 
[02:35:00]  Well, when they first started, he wasn't even on key a lot of the times.  That was kind of the way the music was written, too.  And then later on, they got very popular.  It was more of a pop thing, and it needed to be on key and everything.  Yeah, he was very loose with his being either flat or sharp with a lot of things.  There was like something that was, there was like a lack of personality for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when you're in studios, you hear people's voices naked. 
[02:35:30]  Which, I mean, you hear your own voice naked.  It's embarrassing enough.  But when you're hearing other people's voices naked, it's like taking a look at them showering.  Yeah, I think that's why you can never...  So it's kind of like tattling on it isn't really cool.  You can never really get the impact of what people are going to hear on a record.  You can't really tell what people are going to hear on a record because you hear it as  you're singing it, and you hear just bear through the cans.  And every time you listen to that song, even through when they're processing it...  Unless you're in love with yourself.  Well, yeah, but who is? 
[02:36:00]  I am.  Are you?  Really?  What happened with you and Eric?  He took 74 guitars from my storage.  18 of them were Kurt's.  They're left-handed.  Jeez.  And then when he gets...  He needs money.  He has sold.  Like, Kurt went to England and got all these Marshall stacks.  Like, seven out of ten Marshalls are lemons.  So for a guy with perfect pitch, like Kurt, you know, and Mikko, who's in my band now, going  to the Marshall factory and getting the non-lemons is a big thing. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, I don't give a shit, I don't have perfect pitch, me and Anthony.  That's it.  You know, so, anyway, they say hole on one side, Nirvana on the other side, and he sold them.  Oh.  Wow.  And then he sold, like, a headstock that Kurt had broke for, like, a hundred grand.  And, you know, it's like, there's this guy in BC who collects stuff.  And he's a bit gross, like, he collects, like, syringes, he collects pill bottles, and Paul 
[02:37:00]  Allen also has 45,000 plus items that came, that are, like, basically the contents of me  and Francis and Kurt's entire home.  And that's a long story, and I don't want to make allegations against Paul Allen on your  radio show, because he's got more lawyers than I do.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But, um...  Wait, but how would he get that stuff?  I gotta ask you, yeah.  Well, I can tell you, but then the lawyers would be, I'd have a lawyer...  Because that's potentially a lot of money there, obviously.  Yeah, and the less I talk about it, probably the more, um, discreetly, and it will be to 
[02:37:30]  get that shit out of there.  But you gotta be out of your mind about it, obviously.  Um, I'm pissed.  I'm pissed that...  Mostly I'm pissed that the guitar tech, who was really sweet and nice, um, we found out  that he has 16, so there's 38 Kurt, there's only 38 Kurt Guitars in the world, and he has,  so Kurt, uh, Eric has 17, we have 12, and then Ernie has the remaining X amount in a storage 
[02:38:00]  space in Washington that he loans out to Paul Allen's museum.  Um, and it's a matter, and he did a, uh, deposition in Canada, they got no press, and it's really  a matter of finding out, um, proving that Paul's sister Jody knew about it, because Jody  Allen kind of put it together.  If she didn't know about it, she didn't know about it.  But, um...  How did you, how did, how is it like, it's like, it's almost like in the Holocaust when 
[02:38:30]  they stole paintings and sold them.  Right.  They were, they were eventually returned.  They did it to the Hendrix family.  The EMP Music Project did it to the Hendrix family.  They came to my house, and this guy, Peter Blecka, he's the curator there, he showed me pictures  of things, like I said, needles, spoons, pill bottles, you know, things you don't want  on display.  And asked me, and I answered the door, this is 1998, so he died in 94, so this is four  years later, and I answered the door in his long johns, Kurt's long johns, he goes, oh,  you're wearing artifacts. 
[02:39:00]  I'm like, no, I'm wearing my dead husband's clothes.  Oh my God.  Like, what?  And then he wanted a bunch of stuff, and I figured Paul is really rich.  I'm like, okay, give me a foundation, I'll give you some stuff.  And they weren't playing ball.  And then I put everything in storage with my name on it.  And so it said Courtney Love, which is like a big fucking red flag.  And then sometime in 03, the name got changed to a corporate name, and it went in arrears  after 90 days, and they did an auction, a public auction.  Wow.  Oh my God. 
[02:39:30]  But there's a good part to it, which is somebody was so stupid, they left their real name.  Uh-huh.  So were they saying you weren't paying your monthly storage bill?  Yeah, they changed it to a corporate name.  And what was the monthly storage bill?  Like, what was it?  Was it a couple hundred bucks a month?  Fifteen hundred bucks.  A month?  And so for that, they changed it.  And so whoever this person is paid something like fifteen hundred bucks for eighteen holds.  Wow.  And got everything.  And Frances asked me recently for this chair of her dad's, and I'm like, I don't have it. 
[02:40:00]  Oof.  It's an experienced music project.  So...  I don't see that on storage wars.  We'll see how that goes.  No kidding.  That'd be a hell of a storage bill.  That won't open.  Wow.  Well, it's amazing how they, like, Bobby Fisher, the chess player, he had his, he had stuff  in storage, valuable stuff.  Yeah.  And somehow somebody else got a hold of it, and it was like, that's your personal shit.  They put your name into a corporation, they go three months without paying it, then they  put a little teeny ad in, like, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that says you are going to have 
[02:40:30]  a sale, or, you know, Acme, LLC, Woodside 944 is having a sale.  That way your name's not on it, so nobody comes.  No, your name's on it, so no one knows what they're selling.  And only one person, a sale, where you pay cash.  I understand, I understand.  Wow.  And they take it all back to Washington.  That's sleazy, man.  And it was in Anaheim, California.  Who has the Lead Belly guitar?  You mean the Nixon now?  Didn't Kirk get a Lead Belly guitar? 
[02:41:00]  He did have one.  I don't know where it is.  Ernie might have it.  The last guitar he played on Unplugged, Frances Wants, so she wants to keep that.  Who has that?  That's an art pack.  I have that.  Oh, you have that.  Frances and me have that.  Who lives in the old house?  What old house?  In Seattle, yeah.  The old house that we lived in?  Yeah.  This Microsoft lady who doesn't win the little kids that come next door for their pilgrimage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's got to be.  It's a really waspy neighborhood, too.  That's where Howard Schultz, Starbucks guy, he pulled a 1901 easement on me so I couldn't 
[02:41:30]  build a driveway because the city of Seattle picked on him, and then he charged the city  of Seattle with anti-Semitism, hired Rogers and Cowan.  Wow.  And his kid was the same as his Franny, and he wouldn't let her play with him, which I  thought was snotty.  And he had built his driveway, like, seriously, two inches onto the thing, Veretta Park.  But it's so waspy, and it really is an anti-Semitic town.  Really.  If you don't like Jews, you don't like show people.  That's a rule. 
[02:42:00]  So I remember going into this meeting, it's all these wasps, and it was the Friends of  Veretta Park.  And if you look at pictures of that thing, I mean, every day, they have to take the, you  know, every whatever month, they have to take the bench down, because people write shit  on the bench.  Oh, shit.  Because his ashes aren't anywhere, because no graveyard in Washington that's in the Willamette  Valley will take his ashes.  Why?  That doesn't sound right.  So it's a suicide's a felony in Washington.  It's actually, in some states, it's considered mental illness. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  But in Washington State, for insurance reasons, because lobbies tend to make a lot of laws,  suicide is a very, it's very high, it's very high by men with guns, and so the insurance  lobbies made it into a felony.  So you can't...  So there's no life insurance.  No life insurance.  You got it.  You got it.  That's it.  So where are the ashes?  It took me, by the way, I have a lot of them.  Oh, you split them up a little bit?  I split them up with his mom, yeah.  And so she has them in this Tibetan stupa. 
[02:43:00]  And then there's some under a willow tree.  That we don't know what to do with the bloody willow tree, though.  Because she's moving out of that house.  Oh, shit.  So dig it up.  But I don't want to give it to Paul Allen, and so we straighten this little mess out.  So dig up the willow tree.  And bring it...  Yeah, put where?  I don't know.  Central Park.  How do you do that?  It's hard to carry a willow tree.  Put it in the back of a house.  The willow trees are really delicate.  I'll take it.  No, you can have an arboretum guy.  Be very, very delicate.  I understand.  But if you're going to leave it there, we'll take it. 
[02:43:30]  No, we can't leave it there.  All right, we'll take it.  It's got a beautiful house.  It's robust.  You want the willow tree?  I don't think I can use the willow tree.  I think it's going to be a public willow tree.  I think you're right.  But I don't know.  I don't want to do that Yoko Strawberry Fields.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  It's not really me.  No.  You want it to be somewhere public that can be watched because somebody will take it.  Yeah, that's why I thought of Paul Allen because he sort of owns, what was I saying?  Oh, I don't know.  Now I want to make sure that this whole Experience Music Project, which is that museum thing, 
[02:44:00]  is clean and that my stuff isn't there.  So, in order to do that, there needs to be dialogue.  And there needs to be dialogue between lawyers.  And as Shakespeare said, the first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.  One other question because I think you've got to go.  Where are you at with Dave Grohl these days?  I don't know.  Are you guys cool?  I talked to Pat Smear a little while ago.  And about two weeks ago, Pat was the only person in L.A. that could not drive. 
[02:44:30]  And he was also really happy.  And when Kurt wanted somebody in his band that was happy, he wasn't that great a guitar player,  but he was fucking happy.  So, I said, I know this guy that's really, really happy.  And he was working for minimum wage at the SST Superstore with my first husband, Pauline James.  And Pauline James said to him, if you join that band, you're selling out.  Wow, no kidding.  Yeah.  This guy was a tranny that I married in Las Vegas.  It's an annulment. 
[02:45:00]  Holy cow.  Backstory thing.  It's in my wiki.  Who knew we had so much in common?  It's in my wiki.  We all do it, right?  Of course.  Courtney Jim is into tranny, so that's what he's saying.  Really?  I married a tranny in Las Vegas.  Oh, wow.  It was funny.  No.  I came back to the club lingerie.  Peppers were there.  L7 was there.  Gun club guys were there.  I said, I just married Pauline James.  And no one laughed.  Really?  Now, if these people aren't laughing, I did something bad.  Oh, man.  And then, I didn't have money for a lawyer for like a year, so it took me a year to get 
[02:45:30]  an annulment.  He was really into pantyhose.  Yeah, of course.  So, when Kirk called Pat at the SEC Superstore, Pauline James is there, he's like, if you  join Nirvana, you're selling out.  So, Pat to this day is in the Foo Fighters.  And he said, you know, every time this shit comes up, Dave says, I have nothing to do with  it.  He goes, you know, have you ever thought that it could just be the lawyers?  And that actually is food for thought.  But when I went on Howard and I said, many years ago, I said, I'll have lunch with him. 
[02:46:00]  He went on Howard and he was like, you know, basically, fuck her.  So, it's not a Yoko thing about us.  What it is, is it's not even a dislike thing.  On my end, it's that, first of all, I had absolutely no awareness of how big they were  until a few months ago when I bought my guitar player a Telecaster, looked up a guitar center  and saw what I thought was the Super Bowl.  It was a Foo Fighters show.  Holy fuck, they're big.  You had no idea?  They're huge.  Arenas.  We all know that.  Like, big arenas.  But how did it take you so long to know that? 
[02:46:30]  That's not even the point.  The point is, is that there's a financial issue with, like, money market accounts, pension  plans, da-da-da-da, under something called Nirvana Inc. that doesn't include Francis.  And I need to get to the bottom of what that is.  And maybe it's just lawyers.  Because lawyers are hacks in rock and roll.  So, you know.  But I'm so sick of lawyers.  I just want to play rock.  TV's just never been my thing.  Particularly what we call reality TV or whatever. 
[02:47:00]  And this isn't, like, some E-channel Courtney's life thing.  What TV show is it?  I can't tell you.  Oh, man.  Because it's a network thing.  So it's a big thing.  Is it something that's already on, or is it brand new?  No, it's already on.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  Maybe, like, you know, American Idol.  I can't say.  I just can't say.  A judge or something.  I just can't say.  A judge on American Idol.  I just can't say.  That's a big gig.  I just can't say.  Wow, you're going to be on American Idol.  That's great.  That's a great gig.  I did not say that.  That's a great gig.  Wow. 
[02:47:30]  American Idol.  We got a scoop today.  This show is looking for.  I read the demographic thing they're looking for is disaffected.  I love that word.  Oh.  Disaffected females and homosexuals.  And therefore, there is only one person to call.  That would be me.  Wait, so what show?  The voice?  No, I get the cutters.  It could be American Idol.  That is true, yeah.  What happened to my mic?  It's on.  It's on.  No, you muted me.  No way.  You're silencing me.  No.  Are you headphones?  You're silencing me.  Where?  You're headphones with your name. 
[02:48:00]  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  Opie.  Anthony.  So American Idol, that's a great gig.  I did not say shit.  It's either that or the voice, I'm saying.  Yeah.  I did.  Okay.  I couldn't get on the voice if you paid.  I mean.  Oh, okay.  So that's the voice.  But she's not saying no to American Idol.  I'm not saying anything.  American Idol, they're knocking everybody out.  What's the dance show?  Dance with the Stars?  Dance with the Stars.  Because, you know.  Woo.  Whoa.  Because, I'm sorry.  My whole work gives me so much, you know.  I enjoyed that greatly. 
[02:48:30]  That you just did that.  Did you have the goods covered up?  Very covered up.  All right.  They're covered up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a thin strip.  With a thin strip.  A very thin strip.  She's not denying American Idol.  No.  They're getting rid of everybody.  They really are.  That'd be a great gig.  That would be a good one.  They like someone that's outspoken.  That's right.  A little outrageous.  Yeah.  They like that on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd be perfect for that show.  You'd be honest.  Yep.  She's not saying a word.  Ooh.  All right.  Rumor has it. 
[02:49:00]  Rumor has it.  That's how it starts.  Well, it's been too soft because nobody's been honest on that show for a while.  Yeah.  And you need that.  Don't you think like badasses are supposed to go on there and be badasses and then they  go on there and it's butterflies flying out their asses?  It's like, come on.  Yeah.  You know.  We'll get the real court-y love.  Tyler even, like, he was nice.  They were overly nice.  Well, your buddy there, Howard, he is a bit soft on some of the acts.  I guess you can't just wheel in there and go like.  He's mellowing out, though.  Yeah.  You can't just go in there, though, and be like.  He just had a total Grace Kelly to, you know, he had a totally non-controversial, fantastic, 
[02:49:30]  discussion.  Yeah.  I hope I get invited back.  So you think that on the show you'll be more outrageous and you'll speak the truth if  someone's bad?  On American Idol, you can't.  I didn't say what show it was.  I'm not saying.  I'm just saying whatever show it is.  In general.  Whatever show it is, I shall speak the truth.  Right.  So if someone's lip-syncing or all that stuff, you're going to call them out.  You know, I did the Billboard Awards once and I refused to lip-sync and it was a huge  mistake.  And I'm sorry about our misunderstanding about shock jocks. 
[02:50:00]  No, it wasn't a misunderstanding.  It was nothing.  No, it was nothing.  See, it wasn't shocking.  We barely even mentioned this.  It wasn't shocking at all, right?  That we didn't.  Yeah, we weren't bothered by it.  I know, no.  We just wanted to get to the bottom of it.  That's all.  We were cool all the time.  Look, we're just happy American Idol.  That's friggin' awesome.  Congratulations on the American Idol.  I never fucking said anything about American motherfucking Idol.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?

Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear  and hear about on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week, Robert Kelly's podcast,  You Know What Dude.  Hey, it's Bob Kelly.  Thanks for listening to the You Know What Dude podcast.  Dude, I listened to the podcast on the Opie and Anthony channel, man. 
[02:55:00]  They edited some stuff out, dude.  It wasn't a complete thing.  You want the whole podcast unedited?  Go to Riotcast.com for the whole episode in its entirety.  Riotcast.com.  Bob Kelly.  You know what, dude?  Go get it.  When I first came to New York, I remember Matt Frost hooked me up with a dentist  because my teeth were a little fucking jacked because I was smoking and drinking coffee.  I went out to Long Island and I remember, this is sexy, Bob.  So good looking.  And I went out there and I remember the fucking dental assistant made out with me. 
[02:55:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What?  What?  She just fucking...  What was his name?  I just...  Do you understand how easy that joke was, right?  But it was the timing.  I know.  But the timing was a little off.  And you got the word she out first?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I fucked up.  I waited for somebody and I went, but I, yeah, we were sitting there.  She was cute.  She was like a Spanish broad.  She wasn't the best.  And the girl's mom? 
[02:56:00]  I fucked her.  She's a real slut bag, just taking cock all day long.  My dentist was crazy drunk.  It was weird.  I just got my cleaning.  She leaned in and she started making out with me.  Oh, man.  She's like, oh, sorry.  He had a little accent.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know.  I was like, dang, it's fucking all right.  Don't worry about it.  Did you try to do anything else?  It's all right.  Good for you there, sweetie.  Nah, I didn't.  Once her name came back, she came down maybe two years later when I was on the decline. 
[02:56:30]  You know what I mean?  I was getting into one of my fats.  I was a little heavier than I was.  It was like two years later.  They both came to the cellar.  And over here, you know that Korean barbecue I like right over here?  It used to be a coffee shop, 24-hour coffee shop.  And I brought her over there in the basement where they used to fucking load all the food.  And she sucked my dick.  And I stood on a table.  I don't know why.  I just stood on some weird fucking cutting table.  And it was like wobbly.  So I was balanced.  But it kind of turned me on.  Just balancing. 
[02:57:00]  Working on your core.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's like a butcher ball.  Yeah.  I was like doing this.  And I was like, no, it's good.  Because it was going in and out of her mouth because I had to.  You know?  And then I think that fucked her up.  I don't think she wanted.  I think she just wanted to kiss me.  I don't think she wanted to suck my dick on a fucking wobbly table.  But, yeah, I went there.  I got my shit clean.  And then I stopped.  And then years later, I was afraid of the price.  And my breath started stinking because I got plaque buildup.  And you get plaque buildup on the bottom teeth. 
[02:57:30]  Dude, I'm telling you.  And the one in the back, you got to get that taken care of.  If there's anything an old person will tell you, don't fuck up your credit and take care of your teeth.  I'm telling you.  It sounds cliche.  But ask any old, take care of your fucking teeth.  What are the two things I should do?  Don't fuck up your credit.  Stop blowing dudes.  For you, that's the first two.  All the problem Louis has in your breath is what we're having an intervention for. 
[02:58:00]  That's weird, though.  Yeah, I know.  What's that?  All the problem he has in his breath is what we're having an intervention for.  Like, that's weird.  I still don't understand a word you're saying.  Am I talking fast or slow?  No, you're talking, Porter, Dominican.  I'm sorry.  All the problem, what?  What the fuck?  Are you trying to sell us pork right now?  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  Fucking five o'clock shadow eyebrows.  All the issues Louis has in we're having an intervention for his breath.  You're saying that I have other shit that we could be having an intervention for, you  know?  Not more than your breath.  No.  I love all Louis's other bullshit I'm happy with. 
[02:58:30]  I've thrown in the flag.  You understand?  I'm out.  I quit.  This is what it is.  This has affected you directly.  I'll tell you why.  Because I had the same thing.  Well, the problem, yeah.  Because my microphone fucking stinks.  I'm going to ask my chick, because she would tell me if I had stinky breath.  Let's call her right now.  She loves you, dude.  Call her up.  Oh, she's mad at me right now.  Why is she mad at you?  What'd you do?  What'd you do?  Because I smoked pot on Thanksgiving with my sister.  You have a sister?  Yeah.  Oh.  Does she have bad breath?  No, I'm kidding.  What color? 
[02:59:00]  You guys just fucking melting candles with your mouths.  So I ended up smoking pot last night with Oni, and there's a little bit of pot left over  in the bag, and I didn't want to bring it into the house, because it's a really good  pot, and I don't want to get in trouble.  So what I did was I put it in the mailbox.  Oh, that's crazy.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I put it in the mailbox at home.  Your mailbox.  My mailbox.  But the mail doesn't come until like 3 o'clock.  Yeah, but it stinks.  Kelly, let me fucking finish the story.  You can't fucking chime in.  I'm sorry.  You know what? 
[02:59:30]  We're on a podcast.  This isn't a podcast.  What the fuck?  You're not on trial.  I'm trying not to fucking murder Kelly with my words every minute.  It takes every bit of me not to.  This is good.  Kelly's tits look great today, though.  I had a dream that I ate Kelly out last night.  What?  Lord of God.  Maybe that's why my breath sticks today.  Maybe you ate her ass instead.  That's why that was against me.  That actually was quite good.  I had a dream that I ate Kelly out. 
[03:00:00]  I ate a bus last night.  How did you eat it?  We made out a bunch.  Then I went.  She was hairy down there.  Really?  Big old bush.  I think that, too.  I really think that, too.  Like, she's hairy.  Yeah, big old bush.  And then I fucking spread the bush hair.  You ever see when they kill a deer and when they go to skin it on the belly and they cut  that little sliver open?  It's like the hair.  It opens up.  You know what I mean?  It's like the slice of hair and it's like pink and red.  And then that hair is that coarse fucking deer hair. 
[03:00:30]  That's what I picture her box looking like.  Either that or Miguel's face.  Beautiful.  So you ate it out good?  Did you like it?  Yeah.  Did I like it?  Yeah, of course you liked it.  I don't know about that.  What was she doing?  I'm not fantasizing about Kelly not enjoying it.  What kind of self-esteem would he have?  And she's like, ah, you suck, man.  Lewis, get off me.  I love that Lewis, he got in trouble last time for talking about some stuff, you know, 
[03:01:00]  jerking off somewhere he wasn't supposed to.  And now he thinks that it's going to make it better with his chick because he wants  to eat Kelly's box.  I don't want to eat Kelly's box.  It just happened in the dream.  You're dreaming about it next to her.  That's right.  Subconsciously.  Next to your wife.  You got bad breath and you're fucking eating out Kelly's pussy.  Weed in the mailbox.  I think that was a lie.  You wonder why she hates you.  I put the weed in the mailbox thinking like, all right, I just pick it up as I left today.  The mail doesn't come till three o'clock.  Why would she go in the mailbox?  She's caught me two other times with weed in the mailbox in the past. 
[03:01:30]  Weed in the mailbox.  So now I think she just fucking checks the mailbox.  Because I didn't think it would be a problem.  Dude, she comes, I'm about to leave today to go to the gym.  I was like, all right, babe, I'll see you later.  She's like, are you sure you don't want to take your weed?  And you know when you get caught and you don't have enough time to lie or think, I'm like,  ah, ee, ooh, ah.  It's the mailman's weed.  I don't understand why you're making excuses for your weed.  You're a piece of shit.  She loves you that you're a piece of shit, but you keep making excuses for me.  If I'm trying to cater, I've made sacrifices and I've changed a certain degree for my wife. 
[03:02:00]  But there's certain things that I'm not going to.  Because if I tried, it would just be us fighting all the time.  So there's a certain amount of me she has to accept.  And there's a certain amount that I, you know what, I can do that, I can do that.  On my terms, I decided to do that.  I'm an idiot, okay?  We know that.  Say it again.  I'm an idiot.  And I quit smoking pot, okay?  And I keep on going back.  I'll have like a month or two where I'm not smoking anything.  And then I'll have like a relapse for a week or two.  There's no way you would quit smoking weed if she wasn't putting pressure on you. 
[03:02:30]  I swear to God, I would.  I believe him because I know, this is why, Dante.  He's got a lot of shit going on in his career right now, more than he's ever had.  He's got opportunities popping up.  And he doesn't want to be a fucking stoner and fuck up an opportunity.  Yeah, you don't want to walk into a comedy club and be the dude that stinks like fucking pot.  I get if he's laying off because he's trying to focus.  Yeah.  But he's not quitting smoking weed.  Lewis is going to smoke weed for the rest of his fucking life.  Once things smooth out, he's going to start smoking weed again.  Why can't you just smoke weed late night? 
[03:03:00]  Just get done with all your shit.  That's the problem, dude.  First of all, Troy, nobody has a gifted life like you, okay?  Well, no, I mean, I went through the same thing where I couldn't quit smoking weed.  And it was like fucking up my whole day.  And now I just leave it until the very end of the day just to relax.  If I could do that, I would, dude.  I would take a bong hit.  And she'd have no problem with that.  My problem is I start making excuses to smoke during the day.  I was like, oh, I don't have any work to do today, so I'll just smoke during the day.  And what I'm doing is I could be doing work still.  Or I'll say I won't buy weed.  You mean work, you mean selling oranges on the street, right? 
[03:03:30]  Or like I'll end up, I'll be like, all right, I won't buy weed.  I'll just smoke it when it's around.  And then I end up being at places where I know my friends are smoking pot.  But within a week or two, I'm smoking pot in the morning.  I'm outside walking the dog, taking one hitter, hiding it from my chick because I don't want  her to judge me because I'm getting high during the day.  And it's just, it's my addiction.  Alcohol is not my addiction.  I've done cocaine.  I've done mushrooms.  I've done fucking.  You don't have a problem.  I've done cocaine.  I've done heroin.  I've done shemales.  The only thing that fucks me up is a little pot during the day. 
[03:04:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is, do I hear you so?  I've done cocaine 12 times in my life.  It never, I never got addicted.  There's a lot of people who have never done it once.  That's a little bit.  I've never done cocaine.  That's a little bit for somebody who does drugs.  You don't do drugs.  You don't do drugs.  I've got weed.  I've never even tried cocaine once.  No, I have.  Trick one?  I stole it.  I've done it.  I like it.  I love it.  Hang on, hang on.  Wait a minute.  Stop.  What do you, you like coke?  When it's good. 
[03:04:30]  What do you mean good?  Well, when it's a, when it's a good cut, like when it's not cut up with a bunch of shit.  Are you going to coke right now?  No, I don't do it.  I don't do it regularly, but occasionally if it's around, sure, I'll do it.  Can I say something about you though?  Your life is a little, you, you DJ too.  You're like a known DJ.  You gotta do cocaine.  Yeah.  I mean, you're at a party.  You're at these fucking big bashes.  You're DJing these, cocaine and all that stuff is running around.  You're going to do it, but you also, you're one of the most level.  You have this weird confidence and levelness about you that like, I don't have, I know 
[03:05:00]  I don't have, I know Lewis doesn't have.  You know what it is?  I smoke weed and I do yoga.  That's what it is.  No, it's not.  Yeah, it's not.  It's who you are.  Were you ever out of control?  Oh yeah.  So that's what it is.  When?  When were you out of control?  I mean, I was, I was in a rap group for many years.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  What was it called?  I'd rather not say.  You have to.  No, you have to.  I'll tell you out there.  No, just please tell me the name. 
[03:05:30]  I was in a rap group called Wolfpack for a while.  From Philadelphia.  Wolfpack like fucking.  Lewis?  But, uh.  Like, wait a minute.  Wolfpack like the fucking, the hangover?  No, no, no.  This is a rap group from Philly.  And what kind of rap did you do?  It was like the white Wu-Tang Clan.  No shit.  Yeah.  What was your, what was your name?  So they were nothing like the Wu-Tang Clan?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  The exact opposite of the Wu-Tang Clan?  Yeah, no, it was like a, it was like a, like the, like the punk rock Wu-Tang Clan.  Really?  Yeah.  And, uh, but yeah, we were just, we were just crazy. 
[03:06:00]  Completely out of control.  Just like, kind of like House of Pain?  Yeah.  I mean, in that, in that world, you know what I mean?  Like House of Pain, like, uh, Beastie, or, you know, Beastie Boys.  YBT.  But, uh, yeah, I mean, there was just a lot of crazy shit, like meth and coke, and you  just kind of, whatever, whatever.  How old were you?  Uh, every, from like 19 to about 24.  Okay.  So here's the deal with that, I think, though.  Everybody kind of has that, I did it when I was young, I got out of it.  You know, everybody has that thing where you're trying to fit in, where you're trying to find  yourself. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Where you're trying to, but when you, there's a certain age that you do hit, you know, where  I think you, look, this is who I am.  I'm not that person, and you kind of spend the rest of your life kind of going towards  who you really are.  And who you really are is, you're a pretty balanced, I've never seen you get angry, and  when you do get angry, it's kind of, kind of focused, or, you know, um.  It's meaningful.  It's meaningful.  But yeah, but I had to spit out of control first.  Right.  I had like a, but as young, as a young dude. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  But I mean, I was like.  And you also have that outlet in rap to, you know, get your frustration.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yo, I'm fucking crazy white.  I got a bunch of tattoos.  I like to take a dick in my poo.  Philly.  How was that?  Was that good?  That was good.  That was really good.  I've heard you rap.  You can rap.  Don't even do that.  I've heard you first.  I rap.  Fucking great, dude.  I freestyle.  No, he can eat raps.  You misunderstood what it was.  Raps are healthy.  Both of you idiots.  You build just healthy shit. 
[03:07:30]  But he eats three or four of them at a time.  Have you hated him?  I hated him?  What are you doing?  A dentist thing?  I speak in Dominican.  Jesus Christ.  There's a lot of fucking ignorance in this room.  There's only one smart person in this room.  I don't know who it is.  I was lying.  Yeah, I mean, but cocaine.  I mean, you still do coke now?  I haven't done it in a while.  What's a while?  Probably like about a year.  Three days.  What time is it? 
[03:08:00]  You haven't done coke?  I haven't done coke in like seven or eight years.  The only reason, because I did like coke a lot, every time I've ever done cocaine, I get urinary incontinence.  So at the end of the night, it feels like I got to pee.  And I just stand above the toilet, like wired on coke, not being able to pee.  So I go to bed when I wrap my towel in a dick, because I feel like, or I wrap my dick in a towel.  You wrap your fucking towel in a dick.  I wrap my dick in a towel.  You wrap your fucking towel in a dick.  There you go.  That's wishful dick.  Because he has dicks all around his apartment.  The fact that you know what incontinence, I just aggravates the fuck out of me. 
[03:08:30]  That incontinence.  You dentist thing, and you know fucking incontinence.  Dude, I got to piss and I can't.  You say incontinence.  Whatever, dude.  God, you fucking look a unicorn.  God damn dumb Puerto Rican that knows what incontinence means.  Yes, but I literally feel like I had to pee the whole night.  And I asked my doctor.  I thought I had an STD, so I went to the doctor.  You did have an STD.  Yeah, but it was AIDS.  That had nothing to do with it.  But he told me, he was like, have you done cocaine recently?  And I was like, yes.  And he was like, well, sometimes this happens. 
[03:09:00]  It's pretty common.  So I can't do it.  Yeah, did you know that?  No.  That coke does that?  It fucks up my boner.  I can't get hard on that shit.  God can't get hard.  Prove it.  God can't get hard and they can't come either.  Kelly.  Yeah.  Just a side note.  How bad do you want to fuck Troy?  Nah, yeah, he's all right.  All right, there you go.  Kelly, also side note.  Guys can't get hard or come with you any time.  Triangle.  I'm the triangle.  Can you pass that fucking over there, please? 
[03:09:30]  No, but coke's good, though.  The thing is, I don't know why you felt like that.  Because the good thing about coke is it wears off in like 45 minutes.  And it's done.  So even if it's a bad trip.  No, but that's the thing.  It's a bad trip.  You just go, I'll wait half an hour.  But with weed, last time I had an edible, I was fucked up for like five hours.  Yeah, you can't.  I'm never touching it again.  Edibles are tough, man, because you don't know how much you're taking in.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Yeah.  I remember the time I gave brownies here.  Yeah.  And Greer Barnes went downstairs and just stared at the ceiling, eating hummus for like three  hours.  It's the worst.  Remember that?  Yeah.  He was like on another planet.  Oh, that was on the show. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  They mailed in the edibles.  Well, that was the cookie that I left over.  I took like a quarter of a quarter of a cookie.  And it fucked me up.  Ended up cooling up soda going, I'm freaking out.  What do I do?  You're the king of this.  He goes, get something to eat and go to bed.  Some people, edibles.  I didn't know you didn't call Lewis.  He'd be like, suck a dick.  He'd fall to come and then take a nap.  He'd be like, go outside, go on the subway, stare at all the strangers, have a good time.  Some people, edibles don't do anything for it.  And some people, edibles just fuck them up like crazy.  But Coke, I'm fine.  Coke is like the best. 
[03:10:30]  You don't know how they...  Yeah.  When was the fucking last time you did Coke?  A few months ago.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Kelly, you do cocaine?  Sometimes if I get my hands on it.  I'm not disappointed.  I'm fucking turned on.  I want to eat a pussy now.  Kelly is a coke.  Kelly is a coke.  Kelly is a coke.  I think I got scared though because the last time I did it, it fucked me up really bad.  Like my nose for like two weeks afterwards, my nose was singing.  I'd love it if your septum fell out.  Well, this is the thing.  This is the thing.  You're just a fucking nasally Mexican.  Oh, my name is Kelly. 
[03:11:00]  I got shot in the nose.  Just a fucking hole in the middle of the face.  I have a problem with eating.  What did we find that you're not Australian?  You're just a real coke head.  No, well, in Australia, it's like 350 bucks.  But the guy I was allegedly getting off was like 20 bucks.  Blowing.  The last time I did it, I had a really bad experience because like for two weeks afterwards,  my nose was stinging.  I couldn't sleep.  I was really fucked up.  And I spoke to someone about it.  They were like, yeah, that doesn't sound like you had meth.  Really?  You snorted meth?  By the way, she told me that.  You know when it's meth though. 
[03:11:30]  Kelly, Kelly, tell me.  It was hard.  Hang on.  Hang on, breaking bads.  Why?  How do you know when it's meth?  It just has a different taste than coke.  It's blue.  Is it blue?  It's not really blue.  I've never seen it.  The meth I've seen has never blue.  I thought it was just really choppy.  Like I should have chopped it up more.  That's why.  Okay, speak.  But that's what I thought.  And then later on.  Kelly told me this last time.  After judging me.  Anybody in the chat room.  How much does coke cost?  $50.  $50 for a half.  I was getting it for like $40. 
[03:12:00]  $100 for a gram.  Allegedly.  Have you done coke?  Wait, no.  A gram is hard.  Time out.  Time out.  Time out.  That was the wrong prices.  How much is it cost?  It's not $100 for a gram.  It's $50 for a gram.  It's got $150 on an eight ball.  Are you crazy?  Who are you getting ripped off by?  $150 on an eight ball?  Yeah.  What's up with you getting it?  $150 for a gram.  Can we say allegedly?  Because I don't want to get kicked out of the country.  Hold on.  The Scopo gets ripped off by Puerto Ricans.  We just found that out.  No, I get it from the white people.  I know.  You got to go with the Mexicans, man.  They hook it up.  It's $50 for a fucking gram. 
[03:12:30]  It's $150 for a gram.  It's the Puerto Rican that gave it to me.  That was the bad cop.  I got bad cocaine in Amsterdam.  First of all, why we're buying drugs on the street in Amsterdam is beyond me.  But some dude stole this.  What are you talking about?  Why not?  You can't go.  They don't have Coke bars.  Yeah, but if you just ask around, you can find good shit.  You don't need to fucking buy it from a shady Surinamian in the fucking...  Surinamian?  How the fuck do you go dentisting to fucking incontinence to Surinamian?  Professor Lewis.  I actually did, I did a report on the country Surinam in the fourth grade. 
[03:13:00]  Surinam?  I knew Surinam?  Surinam, yeah.  I knew so much...  Or is it Surinam?  Surinam.  Surinam.  I know so much about that country, and I met...  There's a huge Surinamian population in Amsterdam.  Those are like the black people of Amsterdam.  Well, they sent the Surinamese in to rebuild...  Who the fuck are you?  What is happening?  They rebuilt Holland.  You guys are a fucking newbie.  Is there somebody behind me with fucking notes?  What the fuck is this show?  Lewis did a speech.  I was in high school.  Surinamians?  The Surinamese, they sent them to Holland. 
[03:13:30]  If you fucking...  And if you say anything, I'm gonna fucking kill you, okay?  Can I be dumb and ass with the original countries?  Surinam.  Surinam.  It's in fucking...  Surinam.  I've never heard of that country before.  They sent them there to rebuild Holland after the war.  And so now the Surinamese, the second and third generation of the Surinamese are like...  They're like Roman gangs.  Yeah, they're like the black people.  Because their families...  Their families initially came there to work, and they have houses and stuff. 
[03:14:00]  And so now you have these kids, like these middle-class Surinamese kids that run in gangs and shit.  Really?  Yeah.  And we bought Coke from one of them.  We brought it back to the hotel, me and my buddy Gene.  And we fucking...  Gene?  Yeah.  Mean Gene.  You remember my phone?  Mean Gene Levine?  And we fucking laid it on the table, and it was like crystal-y.  It was like...  It looked like Domino's sugar.  And we still took the chance, and we fucking took a line each, and like our eyes burnt,  and we almost vomited, and we threw it in the toilet.  And let's get cut with some crazy shit. 
[03:14:30]  It wasn't cut with anything.  There was no Coke.  I believe it's just fucking rat poisoning.  These fucking apes just...  Can't trust their nuns.  That's why you stick with weed.  You can see what's going on with weed.  Miguel.  So you should have came, got your teeth cleaned, and bought some Coke from my dad.  Your dad sells Coke?  That's how he puts you under?  Just to get in.  So I can't believe that Coke...  You did Coke?  Everybody in the room did Coke.  You never did Coke? 
[03:15:00]  I did Coke when I was younger.  I did?  I did Coke when I was younger.  Meth wasn't out.  When I quit...  It makes more noise when you pick it up and put it back down.  So why gong it?  That's a flub gong.  We were supposed to get a new gong, but fucking we didn't.  We'll get one, right?  Yeah, I got one.  All right.  Yeah, I did it back in the day.  I did Coke and all that, but I only did Coke...  My friend's father, stepfather, dealt it, and he was smaller than us.  He was this little skinny dude with glasses, so he was just threatening him. 
[03:15:30]  Took him from me.  He was just taking it.  And he'd be like, where's my Coke?  Fuck you.  We'd be fucking stoned.  Fuck you.  Go fuck yourself.  But Coke fucked me up.  I mean, it was all right, but I hated the drip.  Yeah.  It was awful.  It's the best part of it.  I hate that.  That's why I don't do it, man.  It's just cut...  Now it's just cut with such bullshit, and you just...  You have sinus infections from it, you know, like one day, and you're just like, what am  I doing this for?  You don't even know what the fuck they're cutting it with.  No.  I mean, have you ever had pure Coke?  I've had really good Coke.  I'm not sure if it was pure, but really good shit. 
[03:16:00]  And you just...  When you know it, you know it.  Disco shit.  Yeah.  Disco Coke?  Yeah.  But it's hard to come by.  I liked it.  So, but were you with rich people or famous people?  I've had some really, really good ones from my brothers and like the fucking finance people.  Scope, just wait to interject with your story in the middle of a fucking question, asshole.  You're fucking him up on the...  He's doing so good.  Go to the three.  Fucking jackass.  What's the rule, Scope?  Go to the three when I'm talking. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, what did you just do?  Every other game?  He just went through every other game.  No, because I'll tell you why.  Because Lewis fucked me up.  No, because you get a fucking anger problems and he made you mad and you went...  You're trying to always control your fucking guinea-warp rage.  Turn her back, Chris.  Gotta get him.  Fucking...  Your Coke rage.  Your fucking hands freeze up on the mouse and you're going to squeeze it and fucking...  I suppose you don't turn green.  All right, whatever.  Let's just order up some Coke.  Now we're talking about it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, it's on a potty.  Seriously.  I'll call my guy.  Yeah, you have a guy?  I could have it delivered right now.  I could get it delivered.  I could deliver it, too.  There's some Coke.  There's some Coke.  Best podcast ever!  I'm not letting you guys eat in the studio.  You think I'm going to let you do a fucking pro?  My first time doing Coke being on YKWD, that'd be awesome.  Yeah.  You're not doing Coke, you fucking Dominican.  It's also...  Don't say your first time.  It's your only time.  Oh, my only time, right.  Allegedly.  I really expected a habit out of it.  Yeah, we're not doing fucking Coke.  Nobody's getting Coke delivered. 
[03:17:30]  Okay?  What the fuck happened?  Anyway, how much is Coke?  It's $150 for an A-Pol.  Can you guys put in together?  And would you do Coke, Dante?  No, right?  I'm not doing Coke.  I'm not doing Coke.  I'll put in, though.  You got 40?  I got 40 on me.  You got money?  You want Coke?  Well, I would love...  I stopped doing that because I stopped drinking.  Here's the deal.  I would...  Don't do it, then, Scope.  But, Kelly, do you have any money?  I'll put fucking 20 into Coke.  I'll put in...  We're just going to get a pile of Coke and just start doing a line?  No, no fucking Scarface. 
[03:18:00]  We're not getting a pile.  We're talking 40.  I gave 20.  That's 60.  That's not a pile.  How much Coke can you get?  How much can 60...  How much...  An A-Pol?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Well, I don't...  I mean, I don't really...  $60.  $3.5, right?  An A-Pol is two people one night.  It's 3.5 grams.  How much can you get right now for $60?  I don't know.  I don't know if they'll go that tall.  I'll put $20 in.  I'll put $20 in.  No one's going to deliver.  So, $40, $80.  I'll put $80.  I'll put $80.  I'll get $100.  I'll probably...  We'll probably have to go to $150.  Really? 
[03:18:30]  All right, $100.  I get $100.  It's the weird one.  I get a guy come for $100.  You could?  Is it good, though?  It's not bad.  Coke auction.  I'm not going for this.  100.  I mean, what are we going to do with that?  I don't trust Chris' Coke guy.  I trust Troy's Coke guy.  Let's just make us sick or something.  No, I got a good guy.  He actually comes when...  I got a fucking good guy.  I got a good guy.  I know a guy who knows a guy.  I know.  My father was a bakery, and in the back they do the cocaine. 
[03:19:00]  Dude, I haven't done Coke in years.  I haven't even been offered Coke in years, and I've been offered Coke like three times  in the past month.  Really?  Weirdly.  It's just coming up a lot.  Weirdly?  Weirdly.  Dentistry.  I would say do it, but how long?  It must take like a while to get Coke.  This podcast is a three-hour podcast.  No, no.  No, I'd just leave...  I'd literally just leave you guys yapping, leaving the mics on.  I'd come back tomorrow, you guys...  We're in the West Village. 
[03:19:30]  It must not be that long.  Just wake up Troy Kwan's dick in Lewis's mouth.  A little fucking mushroom flopping out of the side of his mouth.  Troy can't get hard, though.  He's on Coke.  I should go inverted.  Kelly's sitting on fucking Troy's face.  Sounds like a party.  It sounds fun.  Do you think Kelly's attractive?  She's pretty.  She's funny.  Yeah, definitely.  Pretty funny?  No, she's pretty and she's funny.  Funny helps.  Are you...  You have a girlfriend?  I did.  You did?  You're done. 
[03:20:00]  Unfortunately.  Coke overdose.  She died.  She had a heart attack.  She did, actually.  She did?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?  Did she really?  Yeah.  Yes, she did.  I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  Jesus Christ.  Why would I...  That was...  I mean, it's...  Yeah, I mean, it's...  When does that ever happen?  Jesus Christ.  Dude, you can't come into these situations for like two more years, bro.  It's cool, man.  It's cool.  I'm so sorry.  As soon as you asked me if you had a girlfriend in my mind, I was like, hang on.  And it took me... 
[03:20:30]  I was too slow to think about it.  And I should have stopped it.  You actually knew?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God, dude.  She's been stalking you.  She actually...  She killed her.  Kelly, Jesus, Scopo.  Kelly killed her.  Hey, I got a guy.  We got that guy.  We'll take him out if you want him, Kelly.  Kelly, Scopo.  For a second, I thought it was Denny.  I'm sorry, dude.  And then I just realized, I'm sorry, dude.  I should have like tried to...  No, it's fine.  I'm so sorry.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay, what happened?  You really want to know the story?  Yeah.  I mean, Jesus Christ, we just made... 
[03:21:00]  Oh, God.  Can you tell it in a funny way?  I probably not, but you guys can try to make it funny if you want.  Dude, it's like...  It's all...  When it gets too serious, hit the gong.  We are in already.  You might as well.  When it gets too serious, hit the gong.  Yes.  So we know.  Oh, my God.  But seriously, I would love...  Not that I would love to, but I...  It's like, I'd love to hear the story of that.  Holy shit.  That has never happened.  Are you going to name this...  I'm going to name this...  I'm going to name this...  Yeah, it's fine.  It's fine.  No, the...  No, I'm not.  There's a million jokes that come out.  No, go ahead.  Let him out.  It's fine.  Don't hold back.  How long were you guys dating? 
[03:21:30]  Well, we were together for about two and a half years.  Oh, my God.  We lived together.  Can I ask how she passed away?  We were in Pennsylvania hiking in the mountains, and she fell.  What the fuck?  Fuck, man.  Get the gong.  Fuck.  I'm done.  Yeah, we're out.  Let's get some coke.  On me.  Everybody's doing coke.  I'm doing coke.  I'm throwing 27 years of sobriety out.  I'm doing coke.  I've never done coke, and I'm going to do it.  I'm doing heroin.  Fuck it.  We're going to get heroin.  Whatever you're in, I'm in.  It's like, Kwan. 
[03:22:00]  Let's get...  Wait, listen.  Can I just back up a little bit?  I hike a lot.  Yeah.  Did you mean that?  I mean...  I'm sure.  Oh, fuck.  That was good.  He meant to hitchhike.  Way to lighten the mood. 
[03:22:30]  I meant...  Oh, God.  I've...  I've hiked a lot in my life.  I enjoy...  I enjoy hiking.  You've thought about it so much.  I used the wrong word.  I've...  I enjoy...  I enjoy...  I enjoy hiking.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to look at the chat room.  I enjoy hiking.  You know, me and my wife go up to the White Mountains for the last 20 years, or whatever 
[03:23:00]  the fuck, 15 years.  And, you know, my...  There's all trails up there.  My family has a house up in the mountains.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I've been going up there since I was 19, going up there and doing hiking trails and shit  like that.  But I've never gone on something that you could actually get hurt on, totally.  I mean, it was always just a trail.  Yeah.  You know, but, I mean, were you guys in?  Were you enthusiasts?  Were you guys climbing?  I mean, how...  Was it dangerous?  Or did it...  Was it an accident that could happen to anybody?  Well, it's...  It's a pretty dangerous, pretty treacherous area. 
[03:23:30]  It's up in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.  It's called Glen Inoco.  Okay.  And when you go there, when you get ready to go up on the trail, it does say, like, you  know, enter at your own risk.  People have died here.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You read that before you went up?  Yeah, but I've been going there since I was a kid.  Oh, God.  Did she?  No, we had actually gone a year before.  And then we had gone up, and there was a huge, crazy rainstorm that happened maybe like  two days before.  And it just loosened up the ground, and she fell about 45 feet. 
[03:24:00]  Wait, the ground came from underneath her?  Like, it gave out?  It's, you know, there's like waterfalls, and there was like an overlook, and she was  standing on the overlook, and the ground...  Like Spock's mother in Star Trek?  I don't know.  I've never seen that.  I don't even know.  I know what you mean, but...  Well, fucking laugh.  Don't leave me hanging.  What, are you a follower?  I know.  No, because Winona Ryder's okay, but I know.  I'm trying to break the monotony a little bit.  Did you store it?  I'm going to hear fucking this sad story, and then fucking... 
[03:24:30]  Sorry.  Oh, man.  His fucking deviative septum.  What the fuck?  Take your dumb boxing nose away from the microphone, would you, Dante?  My nose has been broken.  This is the most horrific story, I think.  So here's the deal.  You going up.  Has she been before with you?  One other time we were there.  We were there 4th of July last year.  So she knew about it.  She knew about it.  She wasn't experienced, but it went...  Was it just you two?  Yeah.  And you were going up and coming back down? 
[03:25:00]  We made it all the way to the top, and we were coming back down.  So you made it, and then you're coming back down, and she's standing on this overlooking  a waterfall?  Yeah.  It's just like a ledge, and it dropped about 45 feet, but it was a beautiful scene where  it was the waterfall, and I was there taking her picture.  You weren't about to propose anything, were you?  No.  Was it with your iPhone?  Yeah.  I have a ton of pictures right before she died.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  All right.  So what happened?  What happened?  She slipped.  Well, she's standing there, and I didn't know this until the police report, because there 
[03:25:30]  was people down below.  Oh, God.  And she...  Just the ground started falling out underneath her, and then finally it all collapsed.  Was it just a little piece of ground that she was on that she got to?  It was like a ledge, you know, but it looked solid.  Can I say something?  Me and my wife, two summers ago, we went hiking up in New Hampshire, and we went up  to this kind of fucking weird overlooking a waterfall, same shit, for like 100 feet. 
[03:26:00]  And she walked over to the...  I go, stop it.  I go, I don't care how not afraid of heights you are, I'm petrified of heights.  I don't like when people go out over...  I go, I'm not dealing with this, because you don't give a fuck...  And you don't have to deal with it.  I go, you don't have a fear of what's...  I'm not saying that you should do this, but this is...  I was so...  I'm so scared of this situation happening...  Yeah.  ...that I actually cursed my wife out.  I was like, fuck you.  She's like, it's fine.  I go, it's not fine, because I don't feel comfortable with it.  Get the fuck back here. 
[03:26:30]  We can see fine from here.  Well, my chick does the same thing walking on the subway.  She just walks like on the fucking edge.  I'm like, what are you doing?  It's like, you know...  I mean, I don't mean to compare, but I'm just saying, I've been in those situations, and  I get freaked out, but you guys would probably, you know, you guys have done this before.  She was probably...  You've done it a million times.  Yeah.  It's crazy, man, because you literally go there, and you're like, you're walking up,  you have breakfast that morning, and you head to the mountain, and you're having fun,  and it's a beautiful day, and you're taking each other's pictures, and you're crazy in love, 
[03:27:00]  and then all of a sudden, it's like you're leaving the mountain alone, and it's a pretty fucked up feeling.  And how crazy do you feel?  Because you're like, I could have been right next to her, too.  Well, then it's just a range of emotions, because she lived...  I mean, in your head, that would have been better.  She lived for about 45 minutes.  That's what it's like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  But then it's like, it's almost like, then you just go through this range of emotions,  like, what could I have done to prevent this?  Nothing.  How do I reverse this?  How do I fix this?  You know what I mean?  It's like, you just don't even know how to process that.  Yeah.  And you're driving home, and you're like, wait a minute. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  I mean, when she fell, what did you do?  Did you run over to the edge?  Well, I was in shock.  You know what I mean?  And I had to climb down 45 feet to get down to where she was, and I literally just laid  with her and was just like, having people try to call paramedics, and you're just trying  to calm her down, because she's like, I'm dying, I'm dying, and freaking out about it,  and you're just trying to like...  I'm sorry, dude.  This is killing me, dude.  I'm so sorry.  I don't...  I mean...  I'm sorry to bring the mood down, and this is just the direction... 
[03:28:00]  Bring the mood down.  We went from having a party to like, everybody's like so fucking bummed out.  Troy, can you leave?  Yeah, dude.  That's what Cuck does.  We're about to do coke, and now...  Yeah.  We're about to cry, bro.  We're definitely need coke.  We're sitting here with a pile of coke, and...  I'm so sad.  Literally a bunch...  I'm about to cry, bro.  Yeah, I'm sorry, dude.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...  No.  It's hard work, dude.  Okay, brother.  No, listen.  You know, this is...  I mean...  You asked, so I...  No, I'm not saying it's...  I'm not...  Not at all, brother.  I'm just...  You know, it's a very sad thing, bro.  And the one thing that I'm getting from this is that, you know, this tragic shit happened 
[03:28:30]  to you, but you didn't...  You found a way to...  I know it's still with you, but you're not...  You...  Still living.  You're still living.  I'm trying, man.  It's hard.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's a hard thing, man.  It's a really hard thing to go through.  And I think about the things that I'm going through now, which are my...  What are my problems are?  Trivial.  And it's...  Well, it's not trivial.  I mean...  I can talk for myself. 
[03:29:00]  You got to close out a Sears card.  Sorry.  You asshole.  Are you kidding me?  Self-absorbed piece of shit.  Dude, I had a fucking...  They fucking said you got to close the card, dude.  And I'm like, really?  It's the worst thing on earth that could ever fucking happen to me.  Feels like my mom's giving in, dude.  I wish they'd ever, dude.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  Could life get any fucking worse?  Nobody's got it worse than me, dude. 
[03:29:30]  Dude, do you want a blowjob from Kelly?  On the YKWD.  On the house?  On the house.  Either Kelly or Lewis.  I'll do it.  I'll roll my R's.  I'll do it.  It's tempting.  Dude, I mean...  And then you had a...  She passed away there.  Yeah.  It took a while, but she lived for a while.  And they couldn't save her.  Well, the paramedics had to hike about a mile and a half up the mountain.  Oh, so...  Yeah.  And then you had to drive home.  How did you drive home?  You couldn't call anyone and come pick you up? 
[03:30:00]  Well, I wanted to just get the fuck out of there.  And I had a zip car from the city, so it's like, I can't just leave it there.  Yeah, because you get charged a lot.  Yeah, I can't.  Yeah, it's just...  Come on, die.  Now, can you show them all the same?  He's grieving and he's cheap.  Well, it's a fucking nickel chaser.  Listen, I'd love to stay up here, but this zip car...  If it was Hertz, I'd fucking take that, but these zip cars kill you.  What did you do when you returned to the zip car, though?  Like, have a nice day.  I just dropped it off, but it's fucked up because, like, you know, in the car, like, 
[03:30:30]  there's her purse sitting there, you know what I mean?  And you're like, you're going home and it's like...  Did you go through her phone?  No.  Her phone broke.  It fell with her.  Did you have to make the call to her family?  I did.  Louis, will you stop talking?  This whole thing is because of you.  It's not because of me.  Did you go through her phone?  No, it was in her pocket when she fell.  It was broken.  We would have never talked about it if your fucking breath didn't stink.  Oh, my God.  I didn't bring it up at all. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, you did.  You did.  It was a butterfly effect.  You fucking asked if you had a girlfriend because Kelly wants to fuck her.  Yeah.  That's how it got brought up.  And then you went, she's dead.  You went, she's dead.  I said she had a Coke over it.  It was funny.  Yeah.  And then he said, she's really dead.  And you went, oh, dentisting.  Cernomies.  Cernomies.  Don't put down.  Fucking don't do it.  Relax.  I'm with you.  So there's a whole bunch of other stuff.  He pushes the mics away when it gets fucking sad. 
[03:31:30]  There's a whole bunch of other stuff that now comes with that that I don't even want  to ask you about.  It's fine.  I mean, Kelly, stop trying to fuck him.  No, I'm like, because the purse leads to the calls.  Oh, you're going to get a simply bullet out from Kelly tonight.  The police showed up.  They came to my, with a house that I was at, my parents' house.  And, you know, they have to talk to you.  And then they took her belongings.  So then they mailed it out to California for her family.  Now, what did her family say to you?  Were they mad at you?  Well, it was tough. 
[03:32:00]  I talked to her brother, and her brother had to talk to her mom.  She doesn't have a father, but her and her mother were very close, and it just destroyed  her mom.  It's just, I mean, completely devastated her mom.  Hang on one second, Dante.  You gotta just, literally, I'm fucking panicking because of your breath.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, yeah, so it's, I had to talk to her mom, and then, you know, that was just, and  her mom was just in denial for a long time until we got out there, and she saw the body. 
[03:32:30]  So, what did she, can I ask her, did she die of a head injury, or a broken body?  She fell, so she cracked her ribs, punctured her lungs.  Floating her lungs, is it?  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  What is your doctor?  Your father's also an internalist.  I work at a hospital.  He's a nurse.  Where's the hospital?  In your apartment?  Come on in.  Shh.  Shh.  Don't wake my mother.  Walking there's chickens, a dog, and little kids. 
[03:33:00]  We do everything here.  So, that's crazy, man.  Yeah, man.  It's pretty heavy.  It's been two years.  That happened in August.  Five months.  It's been, dude.  Yeah.  I can't, you know what, dude?  It's pretty heavy.  Sorry, man.  No, I'm not, don't ever, please don't ever say that to me again.  I'm sorry for you.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  That's a terrible thing.  You know, I think about that.  The older you get and the more in love I become with my wife and my kid, the thing that I, 
[03:33:30]  because of who I am, I'm a crazy comic.  I think about this shit.  Yeah.  And I have to fight those, especially with my little kid.  I look at him like, oh God, what if I'm not here for him?  What if I die?  What if, I'm always fighting these intrusive thoughts that, you know, Patrice used to talk  about where you think about these terrible things that could happen and it may, you know what I'm, and it did happen to you and you had to deal with it. 
[03:34:00]  And it makes me go, stop it, Bobby.  Stop.  Enjoy it.  Right the fuck now.  Stop thinking about if, when, coulda, shoulda.  You miss, you miss what's there by thinking about what could happen.  Even if it's fucking four seconds of missing my kid's energy or that moment, I don't care how corny this sounds, by thinking about this stupid stuff that could happen, you have no control over.  It's, it's the will of the universe.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  It is what it is.  It's nothing you could have done.  And unfortunately, I mean, it's just, it's just life and it's going to happen to everybody here.  You know what I mean?  It's, it's just a matter of time when, you know, and it's, um, you know, but it's just the one thing that I, I, I'm just so grateful for in, in looking back at our relationship.  And we were actually fighting earlier that week.  We were in an argument and, um, I'm just so grateful that we had made up and we were back in love because just the thought of having that on my mind where we, if something was unresolved,  I mean, I can't imagine.  Troy, let me, do you really think that that matters in the grand scheme of things? 
[03:35:00]  I mean, I think people, just like you're saying, these things happen in that time and place in that moment.  But if you were fighting, you were fighting because you were living and it just, he has to have something to hold on to.  And that is, but I'm saying that people do that.  Like my, my, my father, when my father passed, we weren't really talking, but I mean, I loved my dad for whatever, in whatever scope that, that is.  And we just weren't, and he just happened to pass before we made up, but it could have been a time we could have made up. 
[03:35:30]  We couldn't have made up.  It, you know what I'm saying?  I don't know if it changes anything.  I can't, I can't really speak for anybody else.  I just know for me, I just know that I'm just so glad I have that peace in my heart that, that when it was over, we were, we were crazy in love with each other.  You know what I mean?  And like, and in her last moments of living, she knew that she was loved.  And when I told her while she was, you know, in her last couple of minutes that I loved her, she knew that that was real.  You said that to her before, right, dad?  Oh, I just kept telling her, like, I love you so much. 
[03:36:00]  I love you.  And I just kept holding her.  And yeah, man, it's fucking heavy, dude.  It's real.  It's real.  It's some real shit, dude.  You know?  And it's like, I've just never experienced anything like that in my life.  So, I feel so bad bringing this podcast to a screeching halt.  You didn't bring it to a screeching halt.  That's what I'm supposed to do to leave.  I'm talking to Miguel right now.  I'm sorry.  You're going to get laid forever.  I understand.  But that's all that fucking bullshit.  Listen to me, Troy.  You didn't bring this to a screeching halt at all, dude.  This is, this is, it's okay to fucking be sad. 
[03:36:30]  It's okay to fucking talk about shit like this.  This is life, man.  And it's good, you know, we, we joke around all the time.  We fuck around.  We joke.  We're even making light of this in a weird way.  It's, we laugh, you know, but it's, it's amazing to me that, you know, I mean, it's  not amazing.  It's just, you know, that you're, oh, you're, thank you for talking about it.  Yeah, man.  Thank you for, because it, you know, I've, I've just experienced death in the last couple 
[03:37:00]  of years, really.  It's career.  For my first time.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  With Patrice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And my grandfather passed away and I didn't know how to fucking deal with it, man.  I didn't know.  I mean, Patrice, I still believe he's alive.  I'm driving home the other night and I was going to call him because I just, I just,  I forget.  Yeah.  I forget that he's not fucking here.  And then when I realize I'm like, I get mad and I get mad and I get mad like fuck. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  You know, it's just, it's a tough thing and it's, it's, it's, I think it's shocking and  I think the shock, it's almost like when my son was born, I was in shock.  Mm-hmm.  The same type of, like, I don't know how to feel, how do I, and it slowly starts to go away.  Like, you know, it slowly starts to happen and you slowly.  Bobby, because you just experienced this, like you had never really experienced a lot of death  in your life.  No, no, because I'm white.  Oh, okay.  Well, he's, my, my dad, my dad is, is, uh, the youngest boy of 16, 16 brothers and sisters. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  So, well, I mean, you know, he's born 1920.  Yeah.  So, and they needed a lot of blacks on the farm.  Yeah.  Well, not on the farm, but you know, whatever, running numbers.  So, but so at nine years old, I was going to funerals, like from the time I was like nine  years old, because of my aunts and uncles.  So you're, you're, you're not that you're used to it, but. 
[03:38:30]  But the Patrice thing didn't, it wasn't any easier because of that.  Like, but like funerals was how we, that's like for, for as a kid, this is how I saw my  cousins.  Yeah.  I got to see my family because of funerals.  So when my aunts and uncles were passing, so we're talking about.  So you'd kill people in your family so you could get together.  Yeah.  Let's have a barbecue.  Kill Jackson, motherfucker.  I don't appreciate Jackson.  It's real racist.  What do you want me to say?  I don't know anybody. 
[03:39:00]  McGillicuddy.  What do you want me to say?  My name's Dante.  Dante Jackson.  It's a great name.  But they just go into funerals my whole life.  I went to funerals and it just doesn't.  I have such a hard time with like death and funerals and all that shit, dude.  I mean, I've gone to maybe three funerals in my life.  It's a weird, it's a weird thing.  And you just say what Dante was saying before about just kind of like, you know, having that closure  or having that relationship.  Like my mom died and I hated my mom when my mom died.  Like literally, like I didn't speak to my mom in probably two or three years. 
[03:39:30]  And it's fucking, I get why, like now, you know, I look back and I go, yeah, I was justified  for the way I felt about my mom.  But there's still a part of you that kind of goes like, I wish I would have fucking made  things right.  But you make those choices in the context of the time and the context of things happening.  Right.  And you make those, just like you're saying, you know, Bobby's saying, I don't want to  give up my, a minute of my kid's energy.  You make those choices and you don't, you don't, you don't really understand what happiness 
[03:40:00]  is unless you have sadness.  You need both.  You need the balance of both in order to feel both, the either.  So you, you, you can't just embrace the good.  You have to embrace the, the, the, the death and the sadness too.  I mean, otherwise you don't feel either.  That's like what I say about Kelly's role on this podcast.  She's like the death and the sadness of the podcast, but it's a big part of the entire  life of it.  It's too early, Bobby.  Well, we made it.  We let Ken him fucking roll himself out of that.  I love that you made eye contact with him.  I was going to save you. 
[03:40:30]  It's like, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to,  I got to string look, man, I, I, I'm sorry to hear all that.  That's a terrible fuck.  I mean, just the worst thing scenario I could ever dream of.  And, you know, you know, our friend too, um, we have a friend that lost, uh, somebody  to her brother in the war, not in the war, but he was, uh, um, in the military in the  services and he, that was terrible too, you know, cause she's, you know, she loved her  brother and you know, you, these people, it's sad, man. 
[03:41:00]  And it's fuck and that's why it's like life is so fucking great.  It really is.  I had bad shit happen today.  You know, we're not bad, but we are, you know, not, not the Sears card, other stuff.  You know what I mean?  But it's like, what the fuck, man?  You just kind of rolling around and you have these moments where, you know, you're trying  to get home to the people you love.  We're just all trying to spend time with the people we give a shit about.  We're working to make money, to get back to the people we give a shit about, to laugh, 
[03:41:30]  cry, love.  That's all we're all doing is how can I just want to get, I'm going to go to work.  I'm going to fly here.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do that.  Take a train because I'm going to get home and I'm going to have dinner with my chick  or my family or my son or my daughter or, you know, go to Christmas.  We're all trying to just be with each other for a short amount of time to laugh and have  these moments like we're having right now, you know, and, you know, that's why we do 
[03:42:00]  what we do.  That's why we pay the bills.  That's why we, we sacrifice ourselves and you never know when that's going to go away  or you never know when someone's going to be taken from you, whether it be your mom,  your dad, your girl.  I don't know, but it really makes you take pause, at least me.  And, you know, I get emotional, dude, when I hear this shit and I don't think that's a  bad thing.  You don't have to apologize because I think it's, it really puts perspective on the way  things are and the fact that you're, you know, you're still going strong. 
[03:42:30]  You haven't given up.  You haven't fall, you know, fallen, you know, and the fact that you can come in here and  fucking talk about it freely.  I mean, it would be, there's people that there's, even if there's one, one person.  That's a listening that just had the same thing.  That's, that's amazing.  You're helping people.  We just, um, you know, we just, I mean, that was crazy, crazy stuff.  I mean, thank you for sharing.  Yeah, true.  I mean, I don't, please don't.  It's, it's pretty amazing.  I mean, I don't know what to say. 
[03:43:00]  It's, it's sad.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  You know, and, uh, but we, we've, you know, like you said, we're all going to go through  this.  We're all going to go through tragedy and, um, you know, you're, uh, the fact that you're  fucking, you're, you're, you're strong enough to keep going and keep it moving is, is unbelievable.  And I, I can't believe you haven't even talked about this at all.  Yeah, no, I mean, uh, I'm, well, I'm, I got to do a little incident on ONA, so I'm banned  from on air.  Why?  Uh, I got to do a little, a little bit of a problem. 
[03:43:30]  I had a little bit of a problem.  It was like a whole fucked up thing.  I got, I got to do a fight on air.  With who?  Uh, with one of the guys, no, no, no, just a verbal fight, um, on Sam, Sam Roberts after  show.  And, uh, it's actually called the Bob and Sam show.  That's right.  Yeah.  You, you weren't there, unfortunately that day.  Yeah.  So, um, I got into a little bit of trouble in there and, um, it was crazy cause I, I  thought I actually thought I was going to get fired.  Really?  Yeah.  It was pretty intense.  Over something on the air.  Yeah.  Isn't that what they love though?  They do.  I mean, ONA didn't have a problem with it. 
[03:44:00]  They were, they were great.  They, they fought for me and, uh, they're, they're the best fucking dudes ever, man.  They really went to that for me.  But, um, yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, when you work for a big corporation, man, you  know, you, some things go over the air that, you know, they don't, they don't want, you  know, and story of my life with Robert Kelly and Rob Sprintz, holding him back, Bobby.  Yeah.  We don't want shitty MMA news.  When I'm moxed to smell nice.  Ah, Kelly.  Don't push the mic away.  You're fucking, come on, come on, dude. 
[03:44:30]  Just listen.  Don't push the, put the mic back in.  Jesus.  Love you, Lou.  Remember your dream?  Remember?  Remember.  Didn't eat that woofing bush.  Yeah.  Woofing bush.  The woofing bush in between Kelly's legs.  So, so, so, so they came down and what would you, what was said?  Can you say it?  No.  Ah, you know what, dude?  It's just such a weird thing.  You know what, dude?  Welcome.  You don't have to.  It just, like, it, like, I'm so scarred from it, you know, that, just because, like, it 
[03:45:00]  just, something that would just, would come out here in, like, a normal conversation, you  know, then it just turned into this huge ordeal and lawyers were involved, so.  Yeah.  Corporate.  Corporate is a motherfucker.  Yeah.  And especially, you know, anytime you, the threat of losing sponsors comes, comes forward,  you know, so.  We're trying to lose ours.  Yeah.  You can talk about it.  We want to lose.  Yeah.  We have three that we, we have Amazon.  We made eight cents.  No, I'm kidding.  But, uh, yes.  Was this after the incident? 
[03:45:30]  No, it actually, it happened the week before.  The week before your, your, your girlfriend passed away.  And then I was, I was suspended for that whole week and then I found out Wednesday that  I still had a job and she died on Saturday.  Jesus.  Damn it.  So, that was, that was, that was my August.  So, yeah, it was pretty intense, man.  Um.  Jesus, man.  Yeah, I mean, it just, like, this, this year's just been a fucking,  brutal year.  I've had my ass handed in.  Yeah, you're ready for this year, Dan.  You're ready for 2014.  Like, yeah, man.  It's, it's been pretty, pretty fucking crazy.  Friends of the show.  Friends of the show.

Powerful Burt Kreischer, the traveling-est man I know. 
[03:55:00]  The face of the travel channel itself.  Every time I go to the travel channel, I see your fucking face.  Burt Kreischer, right in the camera.  Thank God I fucking lost weight before this season.  It's the biggest fucking...  I look at pictures of me, there was a guy that had a picture of me from him in Philly,  I guess, a year ago.  Yeah.  I was huge, man.  Were you going off?  250.  Were you hitting the sauce?  Yeah, hitting the sauce hard.  It's the booze.  It was the booze and eat whatever the fuck you want at the end of the night.  You're like, this is what you earned it. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's no better way to throw a fucking monkey wrench into your metabolism, right?  Dude, it's funny, it's funny, you get used to feeling sick so much.  Yeah.  You just get used to that sick feeling.  Well, if you're hungover all the time, that becomes your reality.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people, you know, that you see on TV.  You guys are right?  What the fuck are you doing?  There's a lot of people that you see on TV that, uh...  What are you doing, Brian?  I'm just fixing a camera.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  Oh.  There's a lot of people, like Bourdain.  You can always tell Bourdain's hungover.  He looks...  I saw his new show on CNN.  He looks...  For the first time, he looks like the road's taking the tear on him.  Yeah.  Oh, it's been taking the tear on him for years.  God, man.  Yeah, that's a hard life.  He's a canary in the mine for guys like me.  It's a hard life.  And if you want to do a booze in, it's even harder.  Yeah.  You want to travel all the time, fly on planes, and hit the sauce whenever possible.  But, you know, health be damned. 
[03:56:30]  That's the fun way to do it.  What do you want to go out like?  Like, who's the fucking preacher?  Joel Asprey?  Right.  Joel...  What's that guy's name?  Joel Osteen?  Who's that?  What are you talking about?  Oh.  You never watch those Sunday preachers that they preach in Atlanta to those mega churches?  Joel Osteen.  Oh, one of those guys.  Okay.  Joel Osteen, who looks great.  Probably 50 years old.  Or do you want to go out like Anthony Bourdain, where at your funeral, everyone's like, man,  this guy lived a fucking life. 
[03:57:00]  He's a fucking great writer.  Yeah.  Amazing talent.  He makes TV fucking good.  It's so hard to make good TV.  I will say candidly, I don't do it.  But, like, I make mediocre TV.  I make TV that you don't teach a channel for.  But he made good TV.  Dude, and the dude goes hard, okay?  He showed up, and we passed the joint when he did the podcast.  And there's a few guys that didn't make it that went down that journey.  There's a few in the history of the podcast that tried to get high with us, and then just 
[03:57:30]  the whole podcast went into a tank.  It just spiraled out of control.  Don't stand hope.  I heard that one.  Oh, that was mushrooms.  That was a combination of mushrooms, and we got them high.  Yeah, because I remember I was on a treadmill that day, and I could hear him breathing in  the mic, and I was like, I was laughing hysterically.  Stand hope's so crazy.  Yeah, he doesn't like the weed.  But Bourdain?  Bourdain went deep.  Really?  He fucking hung in there every goddamn stroke.  I was amazed.  I was amazed. 
[03:58:00]  And then when we sat down, clearly the dude was barbecued.  He wanted more, I feel like, to this day, I wasn't the best host in knowing when a guy  wants a beer, you know?  Oh.  He's so polite.  He wouldn't say, can I get another one of these?  Right.  And Brian had to go, I think he just clinked his beers together like he's looking at an  empty beer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hard to host a show drunk.  Like, if you've been drinking, anytime I take a drink, I always feel like I'm slurring all  my words.  Oh, really?  I can't even do, like, I can do your podcast drunk, but I can't do mine drunk because you 
[03:58:30]  can totally tell.  Well, if you do yours drunk, too, like, you have to pay attention.  It's your podcast.  You ultimately have to guide it in, you know, set it loose and then guide it home and then  park it and wrap it up at night, where you have to think about that when it's yours.  But if it's not yours, you're free to just be you.  Yeah.  Yeah, so even if you're hammered, you're like, who cares?  I'm bringing in my trainer this week.  You're bringing him in?  I'm bringing my trainer into the room.  He's gay.  I'm going to talk to him about being gay.  Okay.  And then he's going to make me run for 30 minutes. 
[03:59:00]  I need a beer.  Can I get a beer?  We might need a beer.  You know, what's going on?  Gay dudes?  Yeah, we prefer to open up his name.  Oh, he's going to be on my podcast.  Crazy.  Chris Ty Walker.  He's going to be on my podcast.  What the fuck with the last name and everything?  He is gay.  He's gay.  He calls you up the next day and he's like, listen, man, I've been thinking about adopting  a stage name while you're going to talk about me on your podcast.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want this to affect.  I don't want hundreds of thousands of random strangers also knowing I'm gay.  I'm not scared about you knowing.  He's really cool. 
[03:59:30]  He's from England.  He's kind of a stud.  And he is definitely a stud.  Is that for me?  Or how does this work?  Yeah, this is alcohol, son.  All right.  So, um, and so he's going to get me on my treadmill and he's going to run me through  one of his 30 minute runs, like the speeds and everything.  And then everyone listening to it can then see if they can keep up with me.  Oh, okay.  That's kind of fun.  Yeah.  You know what I did?  I had a chiropractor come in and do a podcast with a chiropractor while he adjusted me.  And a lot of people were like, you know, like, uh. </pre>
