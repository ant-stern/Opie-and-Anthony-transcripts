<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' usual irreverent banter, introducing themselves as "a bunch of scumbags" and announcing a free promotional appearance at an RCS store in New York City at noon.  They highlighted the contrast between their unpaid appearance (though they received free merchandise) and the paid appearances of other DJs.  A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's frustrating encounter with Randy Johnson, who refused a photo request despite Norton's pleas and Opie having a camera ready.  This led to repeated calls of Johnson being a "dick" and a "jerk-off," contrasted with positive interactions with other athletes.  Tim Norton and Tyson Walter were mentioned as having been present at the brunch where the Johnson encounter occurred.  A similar negative experience with Gene Simmons was also recounted.  This segment included listener calls about athletes refusing photos, discussions about the Yankees and Mets, George Steinbrenner’s appearance,  an anecdote involving Roger Clemens,  and brief mentions of unrelated news stories.  A photo of Johnson walking away from Norton was mentioned as being posted online.  The hosts also engaged in playful banter about their clothing.

The show continued with the discussion of listener-submitted jingles, many deemed "awful," "creepy," "mean-spirited," and "homophobic," with some containing explicit references to bodily functions and dead children.  One was described as a racist joke.  The hosts then discussed the performance artist Kerry Scarbacca, who jumped from a Chicago museum building imitating 9/11 victims.  Hosts and callers expressed extreme outrage, calling Scarbacca a "pompous asshole," "fraud," and a "phony."  The debate on the nature of art followed, with the hosts deeming Scarbacca’s actions a publicity stunt.  Several callers shared emotional 9/11 experiences, amplifying the outrage.  The segment also touched upon show sponsors, the recurring "Greg and Tony Show" jingle, the messy studio, and the large staff.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion about the 9/11 attacks, including speculation (without endorsement) on conspiracy theories surrounding the events, particularly the Pennsylvania plane crash and the Pentagon impact site.  This transitioned into a discussion about post-9/11 airline security and the changes in air travel.  Lighter topics followed, including a humorous anecdote about a passenger dying on a plane after being subdued by rugby players and a parody of bizarre local furniture store commercials featuring "Bernie and Phil" with explicit references.

A phone call with comedian Dom Marrera ensued, covering corporate gigs, amateur versus professional porn, and spooky experiences at the haunted Comedy Store in Los Angeles.  Dom shared several ghost stories and details about the club's history,  with a caller mentioning a *Unsolved Mysteries* segment.  Throughout the conversation, Opie and Anthony discussed their own 9/11 memories, contrasting widespread grief with the normalcy of some city residents. They also discussed a ranking of top Los Angeles comedians and their own positions within that list.

The show then moved to recommendations for reading material, including a Popular Mechanics article debunking 9/11 conspiracy theories and the mention of Barbara Olsen's presence on one of the crashed planes.  A Comedy Central ranking of the 100 greatest stand-ups triggered a debate about various comedians including Sinbad, Andrew Dice Clay, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, Steve Martin, Chris Rock, Woody Allen, Roseanne Barr, Eddie Murphy, and Jerry Seinfeld.  The hosts criticized the omission of Brian Regan and Rich Voss.  The discussion continued with Jennifer Wilbanks' "Runaway Bride" story and the accessibility/affordability of music via iTunes.  The dual-disc CD format was also discussed.

The latter part featured a news story about two refrigeration engineers injured during "horseplay" with a fire extinguisher.  A humorous, explicit discussion followed, speculating about the possible homosexual implications and leading to listener calls sharing similar experiences, including fraternity hazing.  The hosts also discussed haunted houses and hotels.  The show concluded with promotion of the RCS Store appearance in Manhattan, mentioning celebrity guests Eric, Kenny, and Earl, and a Woody Allen stand-up routine ("The Moose") was played.

The final segment centered on listener-submitted stories of bizarre and sexually suggestive fraternity and school hazing rituals, categorized as "gay" or "hysterically funny."  Callers shared various anecdotes, including incidents involving bottle caps, false rumors about a goat, donuts attached to penises, the "Atomic Sit-Up," the "Elephant Walk," and a high school hazing involving handcuffs, wet towels, and a cucumber-in-a-condom contest.  Studio guest Kenny promoted an XM Radio event. A pre-recorded segment of Jim Norton on the Jay Leno Show was played, including Norton's experiences with bombing jokes, awkward encounters with women, and celebrity interactions (with sexually explicit and vulgar language). The segment concluded with more hazing stories, including an incomplete account from a caller claiming to be an NHL player (under a pseudonym).

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  We're a bunch of scumbags. 
[00:03:30]  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for proper.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:04:30]  I would like to just get to know you.  Hi.  How are you?  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Your medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Oh, and I saw you wrong.  I've got Allison.  Allison.  She's the best friend I could ever have. 
[00:05:00]  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  All of the radio rips me off.  Quiet.  All of the radio rips me off.  Stop whining.  All of the radio rips me off.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Bob, I've got news for you.  I actually don't care.  Bob, I've got news for you.  You are mine now.  How long?  Exactly.  It's not a tumor.  I'm scared of you. 
[00:05:30]  No, we're not.  Quiet.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus.  It's spreading across America slowly but surely every single day.  Bye.  Bye.  Good morning.  Have you done your part to spread the virus?  Have you?  Everyone's looking all nice today because we have an appearance after the show.  That's right.  We're going out.  We're going out on the town. 
[00:06:00]  We've got our best clothes with us.  Where are we going to be?  We're going to be at RCS.  The RCS store.  At noon.  Right here in New York City at 56th and Madison, Anthony.  Yes.  Tons and tons of stuff to give away.  Basically, lots of free stuff.  You show up, you get something.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  You get something.  There you go.  I usually wind up leaving these places with box fulls of electronics.  I love electronic stuff. 
[00:06:30]  Love it.  Can't get enough.  We're the only radio hosts in America that do appearances.  First of all, for free.  I don't get that.  Because our agent is too busy making deals for some stupid DJ in the middle of nowhere  to get his 10% on a $50,000 contract.  Jesus Christ.  Bob, wake up.  We're doing an appearance for free today.  That's five G's a year he's getting from those contracts.  No shit.  You add up 50 of those.  Nice.  So we're doing the appearance for free, and we'll walk away with tons of stuff that we bought. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, these cost me money to go to.  That's right.  Believe me.  That's what I'm getting at.  They cost me money.  Other DJs, they get paid to do stuff, and they also walk away with free stuff.  Uh-huh.  We don't get paid, and we're handing in our credit cards at the end of the appearance.  Oh, credit cards.  I'm buying camcorders, and I get my bill at the end of the month, and it's like, oh,  what did that appearance cost me?  Oh, nice.  Okay. 
[00:07:30]  And Club Soda Kenny is heading there for free today.  Uh-huh.  Because they don't want to pay Kenny.  No.  They don't want to pay us to do an appearance.  No.  And then we go, well, we at least want security, you know, so we could feel secure.  No, no, we can't pay for him.  What?  It promotes the show, they say.  That's what it is.  Promoting the show.  One day we'll have it all figured out.  One of these days.  I'm psyched, though.  That'll be fun.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Get out.  It's right here in New York City, 56 in Madison. 
[00:08:00]  It's the RCS experience.  Tons of stuff to give away right at noon.  Anyone who signs up for XM gets Yanks or Mets tickets and a free roadie, too, with the purchase  of any XM receiver.  And Don is here from Washington.  He's saying that everyone's going to get some kind of gift card.  Oh, I saw that.  With $20 off or something today?  $20, yeah, gift card.  $20 gift card for everyone that just walks in the door.  It looks like it's going to be a good time today after the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't do a lot of these appearances these days, so come on by and say hi. 
[00:08:30]  A lot of people are bitching that we didn't sign their Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus  t-shirts.  Just bring your shirt.  We'll sign anything, okay?  There you go.  Come on by and say hi today.  That's easy enough.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  Look at Ben.  He's in here because he knows what's about to happen.  I was wondering if those Yankee tickets were for tonight's game, seeing who was pitching  tonight.  Oh.  See the Yankees there?  Pulled that out last night. 
[00:09:00]  Did they?  Nice.  They were losing the game.  I didn't watch.  Yeah.  Overtime.  Giambi.  Smash one out.  Yeah, let's talk about a team that's playing 500 ball.  All right.  Well, you've got to make your comeback from somewhere.  I'm a big Mets fan, but I understand that no one cares because the team is just kind of there.  Now the Mets, they have their streaks and then they have their slumps like they're in now.  The Yankees, you've got to mount your comeback from somewhere.  Beginning of the year, looking bad.  I think they're ready to pull themselves out. 
[00:09:30]  They've got the momentum going with this new stadium thing.  Everyone's happy.  You see George Steinbrenner in the paper?  His picture's in the paper.  He should just not take pictures anymore.  You remember the old George from the old days.  George Steinbrenner, for God's sake, pushing Billy Martin around.  He was the boss.  Now he just looks like an old mongoloid, constantly with that dopey smile on his face.  Even when he's mad at people, like he's mad at Joe Torre and stuff, he doesn't have that anger he used to have. 
[00:10:00]  He just looks like a doddering old grandpa that doesn't have his beer.  He's not the old, powerful George Steinbrenner.  There was a picture of him today, all happy about the new stadium, new Yankee stadium going to be built, going to be done in 2009.  And it almost looked like he had drool on his lower lip.  It was all shiny.  And he had that big, dopey George Steinbrenner smile on. 
[00:10:30]  Like, oh, I want to remember this guy as the boss.  The tough guy.  The tough guy.  Because he's yelling at the team every other day now, and they must just be like, oh, shut up.  Shut up.  You used to be scary.  You used to be a scary guy, George.  With your crazy Eddie turtleneck and blazer on.  My new mantra, Anthony?  Yeah.  How about the Pittsburgh Pirates?  Oh, really?  Why not the Pirates?  Why not the Pirates?  That's my new deal. 
[00:11:00]  Why not the Pirates?  Well, who's pitching tonight?  That would be Randy Johnson.  Randy Johnson is pitching tonight.  Everyone, I think, could agree.  They love Randy Johnson.  Great pitcher.  Yes.  We bought you a present today.  There it is.  Come on.  A little present from the boys today.  Thanks.  Why don't you open it up and tell everyone what it is?  I have a funny feeling I know what it is already.  I know you know.  Let's see.  It's a blue shirt. 
[00:11:30]  And it's a large.  Good.  I'm losing weight.  Uh-huh.  Ooh, Johnson, number 41.  Right.  How nice is that?  It's your Yankee Randy Johnson team t-shirt.  That's really nice.  Please don't rip it up.  We spent a lot of our hard-earned money on that for you.  That's nice.  A little problem yesterday.  Slightly.  Yeah.  I am so pissed that I was so goddamn sleepy that I couldn't go with you guys yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  I never go.  But I missed something that I would have loved to have seen.  Anthony, every once in a while after the show, we do a little brunch somewhere.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes across the street, sometimes at the Brooklyn Diner, but we get some of the guys  together and we just shoot the shit.  So, after the show is me, Jim Norton, and Tyson Walter from the Dallas Cowboys.  Yeah.  And we're sitting at the Brooklyn Diner, looking at the fine ladies walking by, and having 
[00:12:30]  some good food and some good talk, and all of a sudden, this monster walks by the window.  This monster.  Mm-hmm.  And it's ridiculous how big he is.  He really is just a monolith.  And Ope looks out the window and he goes, that's Randy Johnson.  And I look and I see this, just the back of this head and this awful nerd shirt.  It was like the type of shirt you wear when you're in fourth grade.  Really?  It had like a red top and then it stopped and it was white on the bottom, tucked into some  like long, long, like six foot ten man jeans. 
[00:13:00]  I'm like, it's not.  I figured he wanted me to run out with my camera like an ass.  Uh-huh.  Well, because we've done that before.  Because we're all onto a celebrity photo thing, obviously.  Was he alone?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Just walking down the street by himself, 57th Street, right past the Brooklyn Diner.  I go, that's Randy Johnson.  And Jimmy didn't believe me at first.  I'm like, no, dude, that's Randy Johnson.  So I get my camera, I'm like, come on, come with me.  And he's sitting there.  I know he's debating.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I go, aren't you going to get your picture with Randy Johnson?  Yes.  And then as soon as I said that, I went, oh, fuck. 
[00:13:30]  That means I have to go and take the picture.  Right.  You're the photographer now.  Right.  Well, because Tyson probably wouldn't have, you know, because he plays for another team.  He plays, yeah.  Well, Tyson wanted to go, well, we'll get to the Tyson part in a while.  Go ahead.  So I'm like, come on, you got to come with me because I was going to go around and do it,  but I needed someone, and he was like, ugh.  Of course.  I'm like, come on, man, because you got to do this.  And he actually, you know, he's a team player, so he.  I'm sitting there, though, debating.  I'm like, oh, man, no, no, no.  And then I'm like, he's my friend. 
[00:14:00]  You got to go.  You got to hook the guy up.  And then I stood up, and I'm like, let's go.  We walk out, and there he is walking.  He's ahead of us.  And Ope goes, dude, you got to start to run.  His walk must just be like any normal person's run.  It's like the gait of a gazelle, just traipsing along.  Anthony, he looked like a normal American walking around in, like, Japan.  Yeah.  You know, you've seen those pictures every once in a while?  Yeah, like an average American in Japan looks like a giant.  Right.  That's what he looked like on the streets of New York.  He is so much taller than everyone else.  Was he just looking in second-floor windows of brownstones? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  He really looked like he was, like, looking in a train thing, looking for Jessica Lange.  No, what makes him look taller, too, is because he's, you know, he's thin.  For a 6'10 guy, you know, he kind of looks like a human giraffe in a way, if you know  what I mean.  Like that last alien that got out of the ship in Close Encounters.  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  Lanky thing.  Breaking little children's hearts.  So I'm like, Jimmy, you got to run, man.  He's just, he's gone.  But we start walking quick, and you can see Randy kind of look over his shoulder and 
[00:15:00]  he goes, oh, great, he saw us.  Because these guys have an instinct when they're being followed.  Of course.  They just know.  And I'm like, this is, I'm almost positive, like, this is really him.  And then I see, hold on, before you go, because leading up to that, as he's walking  down the sidewalk, you know, people are yelling out from vans and stuff.  Not a lot, but, you know, well, not a lot.  We only saw him for half a block, and at least three or four people said hi.  And he was just like, eh.  He was kind of saying hi, but like, oh, God.  That's what convinced me it was him, by the way, was that back view of him waving into  a van. 
[00:15:30]  I'm like, that's definitely Randy God.  That's him, right.  Absolutely.  Don't just wave at people because you're tall.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm tall.  There's some homosexual from a van who thought that mustache looked familiar and just waved  to it.  Oh, there's a gay man.  I've had sex with him on a ladder moving quickly.  Wait.  One guy.  Gay porn star.  So, go ahead.  So, we catch up to him on 57th.  I catch, I run up to him, because he kind of ducks behind some scaffolding at the corner  of 57th and 7th.  No, that would be...  Or is it Broadway?  Broadway, yeah.  It was Broadway.  And so I stop, like, hey, Randy, I'm a huge Yankee fan. 
[00:16:00]  And he kind of looks at me, and I'm like, I mean, can I get a picture?  And he said something about, the last time I did that, I couldn't...  You sometimes get, like, lost when you're in a moment like that.  Like, I really...  It's hard to communicate, because I'm really starstruck, because I'm like, this really is  Randy Johnson.  Yeah.  And he's like, ah, no thank you.  You didn't touch his arm and go, ran.  I was that close to doing it.  But I...  I liked the ball fields when I was a boy.  I used to go, he's a pitcher.  Anthony, he was looking straight up at Randy Johnson. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, it looked so ridiculous, because, I mean, the comparison between you and Randy  Johnson, I mean, it wasn't even close.  No, I'm...  It wasn't...  It was like...  You look like a tiny little kid next to him.  If he would have just taken it out and said, toot on this, son, I wouldn't have had to  lean forward.  I could have just stood there and tooted.  Your whole body could have fit in his jeans, I'm convinced of that.  I know.  Because he has them up a little...  He was that lucky.  He has them up a little high to begin with, and, you know, he's a tall guy. 
[00:17:00]  I think his jeans have to be close to, like, I don't know, five foot long minimum.  Dude, he's just awful.  He's just 6'10", and he's like skinny with William Frawley height.  Pull up the jeans.  He's just a nerd.  Yeah.  He's got, like, the mom jeans, you know, that they joke about.  Yeah.  But the guy version...  He's just a nerd that's a great pitcher.  And so he said no for the picture, and I'm like, come on, man.  And he's like, no, no, thank you.  No, thank you.  Well, you're like, I got the camera right there.  I'm like, he's got it right here, because Opie's ready with the camera.  And he turns around, and I'm like, Joe Fan, hey, hey, hi. 
[00:17:30]  Here I am to take the picture.  Now, at this point of the story here, I'm starting to get this thing, what Opie should have been doing, but I understand what happened here.  Now, I'm thinking Opie should have been snapping like a madman during this whole sequence, but I understand.  Now, let me say, ask me, tell me if I'm right.  Now, if you thought, if you started snapping, he would agree to take the picture, and because you had just snapped, there'd be a delay, and there would be a problem. 
[00:18:00]  See, here's the deal, Anthony.  I've been in this situation with Jimmy many, many times.  Yeah.  Many times.  I just assumed that he was going to get the picture.  Following protocol.  So it's no big deal.  God, if I knew the guy was going to say no, obviously I would have been, you know, clicking away like crazy.  You should have been snapping pictures, right?  But from now on, when I'm in that situation, I know what I have to do now.  The interaction, the denial, everything.  And even if they agree to take the picture, having the whole warm-up to the picture should be on file there in the camera.  Anthony, next time, I promise I'll be Ansel Adams. 
[00:18:30]  I'm going to be setting up all sorts of tripods and everything.  Because you're the guy that misses the UFO picture.  I'm like, oh, here's where it was in the sky.  I am kind of bummed that I didn't start, you know, taking pictures.  Because just the height differential between the two, and you could tell that he was annoyed.  It would have made for some great pictures.  But I didn't think of that.  I didn't think, like, I wish Ope had snapped it.  I really didn't.  Like, normally if I weren't thinking, we're like, ah, it's going to be just a quick celebrity photo.  We'll get back to our omelets. 
[00:19:00]  What Ope was doing, I think, was the right thing in that.  It would have been great if he would have snapped if we would have known.  But what he was doing is he was prepared for a quick one and didn't want to blow it or be an annoying ass.  Snap, snap, snap.  Hey, can I get a picture?  Snap, snap, snap.  You know, the flash is going off on 57.  It might annoy him.  So I'm like, he's got the camera.  So if he would have turned around, Ope was completely convenient and ready.  He'd just go, it would have been done in two seconds.  So Ope was actually prepared and ready, which if he had been snapping away and Randy...  Could have been a delay.  Could have been a problem.  Yeah, which would have been a problem.  He looked, turned toward me, and I'm ready. 
[00:19:30]  That would have been a perfect photo op right there.  And then all of a sudden he turned quick and said, nah.  No, no, no, thank you.  And just took off.  No, thank you.  Yeah, he was just such a dick.  That isn't something you say thank you for.  No, thank you.  He just made a conscious decision to blow off a fan for a picture.  Yeah.  And I have not taken nearly as many as Randy Johnson in my life.  He's probably taken more after two games than I've ever taken.  But I've taken enough fan photos to know what's annoying and what's not.  And when a guy says, can I get a picture?  And there's a camera ready.  And you snap and just go, shh, and snap and walk. 
[00:20:00]  It's never a problem.  Yeah.  Never.  The only time it bothers you is when you're eating or someone stands there and yaps at you.  It's like, all right, dude, you're really inventing my life.  Those people have ruined it for you.  I think.  Nah, not necessarily, because he knew what we were doing.  When he saw that the camera was ready, he knew I was just a fan.  He was just being a jackass.  He was just being a dick, man.  Yeah, he knew.  My thought on this.  I mean, you're a public figure.  You've got to take the picture no matter what.  I mean, if he doesn't want to be bothered, then you know what?  Hire some security to walk you around or something and have them be the bad guy.  Don't touch this picture. 
[00:20:30]  He's a legend.  Get away.  He's probably walking around all day saying no to fans.  Then don't pitch in New York City especially.  You stay in Arizona or somewhere else.  You're 6'10".  You're having a 7 in 6 season so far.  You should be lucky somebody's just not throwing something at you and hoping you punch him in the face for the lawsuit.  I was so aggravated.  It wasn't like people were mobbing him.  Right.  Where I could go, all right, man, he's got 20 people bugging him.  Like when De Niro said no, I kind of understood because he was like, if I take one, man, everyone's going to ask him. 
[00:21:00]  There was a lot.  He was in a building where everybody could have asked him.  Yeah.  He was just being a jackass.  He was just being a jerk off and I knew what he was doing.  He saw Opie, saw me and he went, nah, no thanks.  And he just walked away.  Because we were ready.  It wasn't like I would have to pull out a camera.  Nah, no thank you.  I had the camera up like this and ready to go.  I did take shots of him just walking across the street after he blew it off.  Yeah, there was a couple of shots of him in that awful shirt just tripsing away.  I was so irritated because I knew what he had just done and I knew he did it on purpose.  He just blew off a fan for a picture on purpose.  And I know athletes will have horror stories about annoying fans, but I really have this just... 
[00:21:30]  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I have this hatred for athletes, man.  I really do.  God, you know what, and I was thinking that exact scene because, you know, Jimmy all excited.  Oh, my God, there's Randy Johnson all happy, nice.  He's a Yankee fan, you know, and then as soon as Randy Johnson blew him off, he was just like that old lady in King of Comedy.  All right, now, after Randy Johnson starts walking away, now Jimmy's got to come back to you to get the camera and stuff.  What is said during that? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, he's just like, get me his stats for tomorrow's show.  I just wanted to trash him.  I couldn't call Ben fast enough.  I'm like, Ben, you're not going to believe what happened.  And Ben must have just been cackling.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I'm going to call you.  And Ben's so awful at teasing you, he just calls back later.  Hey, it's Randy Johnson.  Jesus, dude.  Ben's sending out a mess emails.  He's calling Anthony.  He's giving everyone's stats.  Kurt Schilling would have given you a picture.  Dude, come on.  And then Tyson Walter wanted to run out of the Brooklyn Diner and beat up Randy Johnson.  That would have been good.  Tyson's just like, what a scumbag. 
[00:22:30]  And he was a scumbag.  He was just being an asshole.  And I knew what he was doing.  And it's like, dude, you wonder why nobody in New York likes you, you seven and six motherfucker.  That's why nobody likes you.  I'm comforting Jimmy all the way back to the Brooklyn Diner.  It was one block.  And I'm inside just going, oh.  Were you all, did you feel all like, were you getting all hot when he came over and going like, oh, no.  Because the Jimmy Rant is always a pleasure.  I was just sitting there going, this is going to be great.  So he joins the ranks of De Niro and Gene Simmons and Billy Crystal, right? 
[00:23:00]  No, he was, De Niro was the nicest of all of them.  Yeah, but I'm not talking if they were nice about it or anything.  I'm talking about Jimmy Denials.  Yeah, he joined the ranks of, really of De Niro.  De Niro.  I do already have Crystal and Billy Crystal.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  And Gene Simmons.  So there's really only De Niro and now Randy Johnson.  Yeah, well, Crystal and Gene, because Crystal was a complete dick.  Gene was a complete dick.  And Randy was a complete dick.  Oh, that is awful. 
[00:23:30]  How, he's all bent up, too.  Yeah.  He looks like, he looks like that guy that has that giganticism disease or whatever it's called.  You couldn't stop, and I just really have this disgust for athletes, man.  Yeah.  Just, I'm not saying that you owe us your lives because you do the job and you get paid for.  You could stop for a shot like that.  I just fucking hate them.  I really do.  I hate them.  You know, this shot is still worth putting on the website.  Of course it is.  It's right after he rejected you and all you see is his back as he's crossing the street. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, I can't stand away.  I wish I got you in the frame.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's not your fault.  You were ready to take the picture.  You know what?  You post that one on the website.  Whack bag, the Photoshop thread.  Jimmy will end up in that frame.  Guaranteed they'll Photoshop it.  It's just, what a jerk.  What a fucking jerk.  And he did it on purpose.  He saw the camera.  It wasn't in a restaurant.  It wasn't with his family.  I can see this with his wife and kids or something like that.  When you're just walking down the street by yourself and one fan comes up like that, sure. 
[00:24:30]  Sorry, dude.  You're the ace.  You're the ace of the Yankees.  I mean, I'm not even a, you're having an awful season.  Yeah.  You're 6'10".  You're a noticeable guy.  And you've just done nothing but make an asshole out of yourself since you've been here.  Jimmy, you're the worst, man.  Why?  Because if you've got that picture, you'd be praising Randy Johnson as the greatest pitcher of all time.  Which basically is what his stats are showing.  What, he's third in the all-time strikeout list. 
[00:25:00]  He's the first ballot Hall of Famer.  The guy is one of the best pitchers of my lifetime.  Because you didn't get a picture.  He's a dirt player.  He's a jerk-off.  I would still say that he's one of the...  Hey, look, Ty Cobb was a scumbag.  Ty Cobb was a scumbag.  You know, he's arguably the best hitter to ever live as far as just, you know, a pure baseball hitter.  No one's knocking what Randy Johnson is in the Hall of Famer.  But he's just an asshole.  He is just an asshole.  And he probably doesn't care that people say that.  He's just a jerk-off.  And it's like, you know what?  You fucking...  Why can't you stop for a picture?  What's the problem?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  One fan can't call and say I've ever blown them off.  Ever.  Ever.  You can't stop for fucking two seconds for a picture.  And I'm not comparing myself to a Hall of Fame athlete.  I know he gets 50 times more than I do.  I understand that.  You're a celebrity, though, Jimmy.  I'm not a...  I'm a dick joke artist in Jersey.  You're known to people, and they want to take pictures and have you sign things.  I would never...  So in that context, you wouldn't blow people off.  Under any...  Right.  Especially if it was someone that had a camera going, hey, man, just take a quick picture.  Somebody that was obviously rational. 
[00:26:00]  I wasn't yelling and screaming, Randy Johnson!  Randy...  I should have started doing that.  I should have started going, oh, my God, Randy Johnson!  Holy shit!  I should have done that if I had any improv skills.  Yeah, because...  I was so annoyed.  Because the funny thing is, in New York City, you know, you get huge celebrities walking  around all the time.  And most people have never noticed that Paul McCartney is walking right next to them.  Because New Yorkers just don't look around.  You don't look around.  They have tunnel vision, and there's just huge celebrities always around.  Especially this area.  And I don't think you could be a celebrity in New York City and not take these photos 
[00:26:30]  when you're on the street.  Simple as that.  You can't.  You can't walk around like you're a regular guy in New York City, even though you're a  celebrity, and not take these pictures.  You just can't.  Do you think maybe, maybe there were other people that just maybe were waiting?  Like, if you would have taken the picture, then they would have started coming over like  cockroaches.  Maybe, but again, A, most people don't have cameras on 57 just walking.  The majority of them do not carry cameras.  They're stupid camera phones.  Oh, yeah, camera phones. 
[00:27:00]  But he was just being a dick, and he saw the camera was ready.  He could have stopped it and just crossed the street immediately.  He could have done it.  It was right there.  And honestly, Anthony, it would have been a second.  We were absolutely right.  One second.  Honestly, Anthony, that's a great question, but where we were situated at the time, no  one really noticed what we were doing.  Yeah, it was so ready.  Yeah, because we were under scaffolding, and it was just like, no one was really looking  at him at that point.  A couple people he waved to an advance, but it wasn't like anyone was behind him, walking.  He was just being an asshole, and it's just like, I just can't stomach athletes most  of the time.  I really can't. 
[00:27:30]  Giambi was always a dick from what I heard, but then someone said he was nice.  Now that he's got this whole thing going, he might have been nice all along.  I never had the experience with him.  But I just had this hatred of athletes in general.  I really do.  Dude, I cannot stand most of them.  I fucking hated you in high school.  You're just arrogant, arrogant motherfuckers.  Yeah.  I just can't stand the sight of motherfuckers.  Not a big fan of the jock myself.  I can't stomach you.  So you think Randy's a dirtbag?  Randy's a dirtbag.  He was just an asshole.  He was just a douche. 
[00:28:00]  I mean, look, the guy gave a lot of money to charity.  I asked for his stats.  Damn it.  That's where I was going to slam him in.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying he's a dirtbag.  Randy Johnson Info, Anthony, made $400,000 donation to the American Red Cross tsunami  relief effort.  Yeah.  Has donated more than $300,000 personally to various charities through his strikeout homelessness  program.  He could have just stood there and held the children up over his head and saved them from  the tsunami.  Tall dork.  Pledges $1,000 per win and $100 per strikeout to go to groups around Tri-State area.  Oh, wow. 
[00:28:30]  Donated more than 3,500 pairs of Nike sneakers during holiday seasons.  Those $1,000 per win aren't really cashing out this season, are they?  Well, an avid photographer who has had his work featured in Art Expo 90 in Los Angeles.  Jesus Christ, dude.  You're a photographer.  Maybe you could have kissed me like that sailor after World War II and hope you could have  snapped a photo of it.  Fucking jerk.  But you would have to kiss his mule.  I wouldn't have cared.  I would have.  Unless he bends down like a giraffe to try to get some water. 
[00:29:00]  Dude, I'm not dishonest.  I mean, I'm not saying the guy's a scumbag as a person.  He was just an asshole.  And it's like, I knew what he was doing publicly.  He's just a dick.  Five-time Cy Young award winner.  Dude, you can't deny the guy is a first ballot hall of fame.  You've been blown off by the best, man.  Five-time Cy Young award winner.  The only guy that could have blown me off that would have had an equal would have been  Clemens.  Would have been the only pitcher in our lifetime that we could go, wow, Clemens blew me off  or Randy Johnson blew me off.  Good question coming in from John in Jersey. 
[00:29:30]  John?  Yeah, Anthony.  Ty Cobb, he was a total asshole.  Didn't he blow you off for a photo of it?  Yes.  Me and Groucho, I remember, we wanted a picture with Ty Cobb, and I got blown off.  Goddamn, John, that's funny.  You stink.  Oh, come on, man.  Groucho Marx, if he was alive today, would be 115, and you got a photo with him.  Let's just keep acknowledging that.  What are you going to do?  I was a kid, and he was at death's door. 
[00:30:00]  You don't look old.  I'm starting to think you have some kind of sleep chamber at your house.  There's no sleep chamber.  Groucho Marx was two years away from death, I think in his 90s or something, and I was  a kid.  Sure.  Whatever.  Anthony's a vampire.  He sleeps in a thing of dirt from his home country.  Boo.  A vampire.  He's a vampire that hasn't worn the same shirt twice since we started here at XM, and it's  really starting to freak me out. 
[00:30:30]  I like to make fashion statements.  Eddie, Eddie, get me a shirt out of my closet.  Boo.  We were discussing Anthony and his shirts today.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like that.  I've seen that Richard Pryor shirt many times on Jimmy.  Yes.  You guys have seen this dumb shirt on me many times.  Sure have.  Ben's wearing the same shirt that I've seen him wear hundreds of times.  Anthony?  Nope.  I've actually never seen that shirt on anybody who is not in fourth grade. 
[00:31:00]  It's like one of those eyes-on shirts.  Don't you like, yeah, with the collar and little stripes and stuff, but, yeah, I was  thinking that, too.  It's like, I need my lunchbox.  You don't come with a trapper keeper and an abusive black sixth grader.  You're going with a safe collar today, though.  We can't make fun of the collar today.  It's like olive or something.  I don't know what that is.  Brown.  Where's that Periwinkle shirt?  Periwinkle?  It's in my closet somewhere.  It's back in the closet?  Yeah.  It's back in the closet where it belongs. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What can I say?  I have a lot of clothes.  Yep.  Let's go to a couple phone calls.  M.O. is what again?  We figured this out yesterday.  Oh, it doesn't matter anymore.  Missouri.  Missouri, right?  Mike on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How's everybody doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  Who cares, Jimmy?  Who cares about all this great shit that he did and all these donations that he makes?  The fact that he blows people off just shows how much of a dick he really is. 
[00:32:00]  No, dude, I'm not even disagreeing with you, but I'm saying I can't be dishonest.  That would be like saying, hey, the guy's an awful pitcher.  I mean, he's just a dick to fans.  But to say that he's just like, opens like you think he's a dirtbag?  But as a person, I can't say he's a dirtbag.  He's just an asshole to fans.  And he deserves no fan love whatsoever.  But as far as, you know, he donates money.  You can't deny that.  And no, he can't.  But still, the fact that he treats his fans, people that pay his contract, like garbage. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, and I...  He doesn't say a lot about his character.  No, he's just...  Well, he's just an asshole, dude.  He's one of those guys who just doesn't like fans.  And since he's gotten to New York, he has done nothing but made an ass out of himself.  It's like, dude, if you don't want to be here, man, you're a hired gun.  Just fucking go back to Arizona.  Yeah, you're not getting bothered in Arizona.  You're in your car most of the time.  You're pitching for the Yankees.  If you don't want to pitch for the Yankees, leave.  Just leave.  God almighty, you're not doing anybody a favor at 7-6.  You're not doing us a favor. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, but the team isn't...  I would take Andy Pettit over him any day.  I would rather lose with Andy Pettit than win with him.  I swear to God.  I mean that.  They're not getting the hitting done, though.  I mean, come on.  Oh, the hitting's atrocious.  Hey, Noah's weird about the whole thing.  So we're walking back to the Brooklyn Diner, and I was thinking about Jimmy's life.  I'm thinking, only a mere two days prior...  Oh, I know, right?  He's on Jay Leno's couch.  Yeah.  I mean, not only is he doing stand-up on The Tonight Show, which is obviously just so impressive, 
[00:33:30]  then he gets to sit next to Jay on a couch and talk with Jay for three or four minutes.  Two days later, he's getting blown off by Randy Johnson.  Yeah, just blown off.  Like you're nothing.  Well, I'm not like I'm nothing.  I am nothing.  And he seemed to realize that and acknowledge it with his walk away.  A few people are suggesting, did you look up at him and go, but you're the big unit.  I really...  I looked at him and licked my lips.  I made Randy Johnson uncomfortable.  But this guy just has a history of being an absolute asshole to the fans. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, man.  And to people...  He's been like that to New York since he got here.  And if you don't like New York, dude, just fucking leave.  It just annoys you.  I hate athletes.  I cannot stomach most of you.  All right, let's...  Because you're not funny guys.  You're not talented guys.  Most of you.  Not all of you.  But you have nothing going.  And you're great at what you do.  But you're bores.  Every time you're on Letterman or Leno, you just stink.  You know, it just goes with the territory. 
[00:34:30]  If you're a celebrity in New York, it just does.  I mean, you have to walk around a lot.  And you're going to get bothered.  Again, with your wife and kids, that's one thing.  If it's something you can't deal with, then maybe you should go play somewhere else.  Yeah.  Or take a cab, you giraffe.  Cut a hole in the roof like one of the Flintstones and fucking take a cab.  All right, the phones have exploded.  You giraffe.  Yeah, put on some stupid collared shirt and sell toys.  Let's go to John in Connecticut.  John?  Hey, yo, hey.  Hey, my little scout buddy. 
[00:35:00]  How you doing?  What's up, man?  Hope you like all them little puffy lips I've been sending you.  Hey, listen.  Thank you, yes.  I just figured, Anthony, we could come out with a new game.  New Colorforms game, Dr. Anthony.  Peel off shirts, put on new shirts every day.  I should have a little Colorforms set.  Colorforms.  Hey, I like that.  Remember Colorforms?  Sure do.  Let's go to Rick in Boston.  Rick, what's up?  Good morning, man.  Good morning, O.  Good morning.  When Roger Clemens used to play for Boston, he lived in Framingham. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And we used to all go to this pizza place that he'd go to sometimes, and we asked him for  an autograph one day.  I think we were like 15.  The asshole wanted to charge us $25.  $25?  Well, he asked him to sign.  A fucking napkin.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That's weird.  We were 15.  We said, $25, Roger?  What's that?  He goes, that's what I'd charge outside the field.  Outside the field.  Jesus. 
[00:36:00]  You know, Mike Birbigley is a comedian I know, and he just did like the SB Awards or some  athlete award show, and he said he did a joke about Clemens that when he was 15 or something  he asked for an autograph, and Clemens wanted to charge him $20, but now that I asked him  tonight, he just charged me $15.  It was like a roast joke he did.  And I forget exactly the nature of the joke, but he had a similar experience, I think,  this guy I know, so I guess this guy's probably telling the truth.  Huh.  All right, let's go to Mike in Clifton.  Mike?  Yeah, you know, me and my friend Buccafoli, we used to hang out at the gates when the guys 
[00:36:30]  used to come out, and we'd be sitting there, and all the guys would take pictures with us  except Randy Johnson.  He would always just walk away from the fans.  That would cheater would mingle around, A-Rod would, but not him.  He's too good for everyone.  Yeah, he makes me sick, dude.  Jeter is like, first of all, Jeter is also a great player, a first ballot Hall of Famer,  and Jeter, from what I've heard, is always great.  I know he stops and takes time.  All right, yeah, you know what, but that's something we were talking about in the back  office.  Don, Don Wickey is here from Washington, and we were talking about the Randy Johnson thing, 
[00:37:00]  and Don's like, you know, Cal Ripken would stay after the game until everybody got their  autographs.  Every kid walked away with an autograph.  And Don's thinking, that just shows Cal Ripken's character.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking to myself, most of these athletes and celebrities, they hang out and  give all their autographs because they're looking for the hot chicks to bat.  Yeah, the baseball groupies.  You really think Cal Ripken, you know, I'm just assuming here, obviously, but you think 
[00:37:30]  in his mind that he's that good of a guy that he stays after, you know, long after the  game's over to make sure everyone gets an autograph?  He sure seemed like a nice enough guy.  I'm sure he's nice to a point, but there's also, you're looking for the eye candy, some  of these guys obviously looking for the hookup, looking for the mistress in this city and  that city.  Right.  You think Derek Jeter really is that good of a guy when it comes down to it?  Yeah.  Or is he looking around like, oh, look at that hoochie mom over there?  I've heard enough people who have met him and dealt with him where he is actually a 
[00:38:00]  really nice guy.  And I actually, my ex went on a date with him one time.  Nothing happened.  The crazy ex?  Yeah.  She went to dinner with him one time.  The one that was in the car with Denzel?  Yeah.  But nothing happened.  She just did a kiss, right?  She said he was a total gentleman and a nice guy.  She's like, he's just a sweet guy.  So, I mean, everyone who I've ever met who has dealt with him has said he's a great  guy.  Did you ever get the story from her about Denzel?  There was nothing happened.  I'm like, are you banging him?  And she's like, no.  She called me the other night, though.  She took me for a ride in her ex-boyfriend.  I tell you, she picked me up in front of the cellar in a $160,000 Porsche, the same 
[00:38:30]  one that Denzel was in.  It's now fixed.  And took me for a ride in it.  Really?  And dropped me off in a Saturn.  The hot chick dropped me off in a Saturn.  That's really...  Out of a Porsche.  Yeah, exactly.  Out of a $160,000 Porsche.  Whose Porsche is it?  Her, uh...  I don't know if she's still dating him.  Her ex, she's still friends with this guy who's...  Sounds like an OJ situation.  Driving around in the expensive car with another guy, the ex-boyfriend.  I know.  I met him before.  He's okay.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's fine.  He's just...  They're just still kind of eyeing off again dating.  Uh-huh. 
[00:39:00]  But, you know, she and I are never going to date again.  We're just friends.  And it's one of the only exes I can be friends with.  And what was she doing in the car with Denzel?  Honestly, nothing.  Because she would have told me.  I know she would have told me.  No, no.  I'm not...  You don't even understand my question.  What?  Oh.  I'm not saying, what did she do?  Are they fucking...  It's not like you just end up with Denzel in your car.  Yeah, why was she...  It's like, what was she doing?  Oh, she...  You go, oh, nothing.  No, how did Denzel get in her car?  Because none of us have a story like that, Jimmy.  You don't just end up with Denzel in your car.  She's friends with somebody he knows, I think.  I didn't get the full story.  No?  I honestly didn't. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  But I know she went out to dinner the next night.  She had dinner with him again after that with him.  Like, Jay-Z, Puff Daddy, a bunch of, like, really big people...  Really?  ...that are not white.  That are not white.  But she said they were all nice.  Every one of them was really cool to her.  Did she dabble in the black car?  She's dated.  Well, she's told me some people she's dated.  What?  Yeah, she dated black and white.  Yeah, but she's more...  Why is she hanging out with all those people?  Something's going on.  She's always getting...  She's the type of girl that would always get invited to this party.  She dated one of the expatriates years ago.  I don't want to say his name. 
[00:40:00]  He might call his lawyer.  Oh.  But, um...  But, yeah, she's dated...  Whatever.  Wow.  Some athletes.  And how she ever fucked me, I'll never know with my mushiness.  She likes banging celebrities, I guess.  No, she met me before I was anybody on your show, even, really.  She never came.  Yeah, Jimmy was barely doing our show at that point.  She can probably smell it.  And she saw my dumpy apartment in Jersey.  Nah, she saw my dumpy apartment in Jersey.  She can smell greatness.  Well, apparently it was...  Greatness smells like mold, because that's what I had in my old apartment.  When we had lunch, Jim and I had lunch with Jay Moore when he was in town, and Jay's friends 
[00:40:30]  with a lot of baseball players, and he was talking about what baseball players are dicks  and stuff.  And he was talking...  Do you remember the story?  He was talking about Nomar, how Nomar, when he gets off the bus to go into the stadiums  when they're on the right of the hotel, he won't sign autographs, take pictures, or  anything, because he calls it his time, and it's because he got so many pants ruined  from Sharpies when he would be walking down, talking to the fans, he would have marks all  over his pants.  So that is what he calls it.  That's why he doesn't do it?  The only time he doesn't do it. 
[00:41:00]  Nomar's the only...  A lot of these guys are superstitious nuts.  And Jay said the only time Nomar won't do it, and it's become a thing with him, is  from the bus to the hotel.  Like, that's his time.  Like, all right, whatever.  He'll do it probably at the stadium.  There's a million places he'll do it.  This wasn't the case with Randy Johnson.  And I can understand that.  Unless he has a thing, the only place I won't do it is when I'm dressed like a five-year-old  on 57th.  The only time I won't take a picture is when I'm in child's clothing on 57th and Broadway.  We need to get that picture up on opianthony.com, the one with him crossing the street after 
[00:41:30]  he blew you off.  Yeah, playing cult music.  It was really, really irritating.  But I can understand that these guys...  Like, Roger Clemens, I read a story of something where he wouldn't take one on an elevator,  but he's superstitious about games.  Maybe Jay Moore told that story.  Oh, man, you know, their lives are not that tough.  I understand, but some of these guys are superstitious guys.  I mean, we're quoting that celebrity world.  Our lives are pretty fucking cool.  And if it means, you know, taking a picture or signing an autograph, who cares?  There's guys out there with real problems and jobs and, you know, things they have to 
[00:42:00]  worry about.  But they are superstitious.  There are times where I do believe that.  Like, Clemens won't do it on game day.  It's just his thing.  Maybe that's his thing.  Maybe for real that's his thing.  Wade Boggs was a psycho.  He would only eat chicken.  You know, I mean, Wade was...  I can kind of go with that.  I'm not naive to the fact these guys, you know, are professionals and they have things  to think about.  But you had nothing to...  He was carrying something in his right hand.  You had...  Jesus.  You had...  He was going down on his banana.  Yeah, that's always cute.  Bah!  What an intelligent little joke from the improper Bostonian on Wackbag. 
[00:42:30]  She dated an expatriate.  Was it Hemingway?  Gertrude Stein?  An expatriate.  That's a good one.  I'm going to go with Samuel Adams.  Oh.  He was a patriot.  Why don't we take a break?  And we'll continue the Open Anthony program.  Boss got an autograph from Mariana Rivera.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  That's a good one.  It's a great one.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  It's a Newark Airport pulling out of a...  Where I always park, out of the parking deck at Continental.  Just waiting in line.  He walks up to the window and got an autograph.  Really?  In his car.  Moe signed it.  Wow, nice.  Very sweet.  That's why I love that Yankee team a few years ago.  They were all nice guys.  They all seem like nice guys.  All the...  You never heard problems about them.  But when you bring in these hired guns...  Gianvi...  I hate these fucking guys.  I hate them.  Yes, you do.  I hate them, man.  And I'm loyal.  If I love a player, I'll support him. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe when he stinks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't care.  I would rather lose with guys that I like.  I really would with guys that have been here.  I despise the disloyalty of Steinbrenner getting rid of these guys.  Oh, man.  Every team's doing it, though.  I know, dude.  I know.  I hate it.  People always complain about player loyalty.  It's the nature of baseball, unfortunately.  I still hate it.  I'd rather lose with guys that came up with Yorker.  I'd rather lose with Bernie Williams.  I don't want to see Bernie leave.  I'd rather lose with him than win with some fucking hired gun.  That's what was fun about baseball when we were growing up.  You had the same team year after year, and when they finally did win something, it really  meant a lot. 
[00:44:00]  You know, because you felt for these guys, you know?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  On the way, we've got to talk about the Indians suing for land in the Hamptons.  That's a really good story.  Bill Clinton wants to be a shock jock.  No, he might do a radio show.  Shock jock.  Are you serious?  How much are they offering him?  $35 million.  Drunkstick fire extinguisher up a friend's ass.  What?  Yeah.  Terry Shivo autopsy.  Oh, God.  We'll get into that. 
[00:44:30]  And there's a performance artist that wants to do something that is just pissing off a lot  of people today.  We'll get into that story right after the break.  And also, a little acknowledgement.  XM doing their job today.  We've got a huge ad in the Philadelphia Daily News, I guess.  So if you're in the Philly area, maybe you could mail it up to us in New York so we can  take a look at it ourselves.  But there's a huge, huge advertisement for the Opie and Anthony show only on XM Radio.  And it's a pretty cool ad.  So thank you to XM.  A fine job.  And Eric Logan for getting that done. 
[00:45:00]  We greatly appreciate it.  And as we speak, Jim Norton gets blown off by Randy Johnson.  The photograph of him walking across the street with his back turned to Jimmy is now up on  opieandanthony.com.  He looks like he should be walking towards the Empire State Building with a blonde on his  shoulder.  Just look at this monster traipsing across the road.  It hurts.  Uh-oh.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day virus. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, by the way, what happened with you and Gene Simmons?  Oh, that asshole.  All I know is I was getting phone calls all night long from you, Ben.  Ben laughing his ass off.  Really?  That's surprising.  Gene.  What?  Gene blew him off.  What happened?  Gene Simmons.  You just had him on the show, what, a week ago?  Two weeks ago?  I'm in the bathroom.  All right, granted, that's a little bit creepy.  I'm in the bathroom, and I see him, and he walks in the men's room at the Venetian.  So he walks by, I go, hey, Gene. 
[00:46:00]  And he goes, hello.  And, of course, he doesn't look.  He just keeps going straight.  Again, he's a rock star.  I don't blame him.  I wouldn't look at me either in the men's room.  I decide to wait outside and say hello real quick.  And his security notices me kind of lurking there with Steve.  So Gene walks out, and I'm like, hey, man, you know, I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  You just called in last week.  And he's like, all right.  And he just won't even look.  He just walks right by.  Wow.  Steve, were you there when he got blown off by Gene Simmons?  Yeah, we both did.  We both got totally, totally blown off.  And I really kind of said, oh, hey, Gene Simmons. 
[00:46:30]  He said, oh, hi, how you doing?  And as Jimmy came out, we waited.  We were going to talk to him.  And it was just so goddamn dismissive and condescending.  And we totally explained who we were, exactly who we were, mentioned the fact that he was on the show.  We just wanted to talk to him.  And his response was, that's nice. 
[00:47:00]  Nice for you.  I have to go.  And he goes, and then he had to leave.  And he goes, oh, I'll be in the air.  I might see those guys later.  And I'm like, all right, can I just get a quick picture with you?  He's like, no, I'm really running late.  He goes, you can walk with me if you want.  So I start walking with him to get the picture.  And then Yoshi is just backing up and like trying to take, all he had to do was stop for one second.  And he wouldn't stop or look at me.  So fuck you, Gene.  Oh, hey, relax.  Oh, that really annoyed me.  That really annoyed me.  He was one of your heroes growing up. 
[00:47:30]  He was one of my heroes growing up.  When you were Jimmy Robbins.  Sorry I wasn't hawking a Kiss keychain, motherfucker.  It wasn't just the setup to maybe cuddle you a little later?  Oh, did he annoy me?  Every bit of loyalty I had for him went out the window.  And I wanted to spit on him.  I was so aggravated.  Wow.  How many bad people bashed him, called in, trashing him.  And like an asshole, I defended him.  You did.  Time and time again.  And he doesn't need me to defend him.  He's a billionaire.  It's not going to change.  But it just really, really annoys me. 
[00:48:00]  Look, I'm not anywhere near that level of fame.  But I've taken enough fan pictures to know that you can stop for one second.  A second.  Disinterested shithead.  Wow.  Six foot three in your dark Undertaker suit.  That stupid straight ahead look on your face.  We get it.  You're a genius.  We get it.  You have really turned.  Oh, did that?  I can't tell you.  That's a lousy picture.  I am so tired.  Yeah, but you know what?  It was Steve was right.  I understood he was busy and he had to leave.  Dude, I didn't expect a 40 minute photo shoot. 
[00:48:30]  But he knew that we were talking about being on the show and we're members of the show.  And he could have just stopped for one second and taken that picture.  He didn't give a shit.  Right.  Sorry, I didn't have anything to sell for you.  That's what it was.  It wasn't advantageous to him to stop for a second.  There was nothing in it for him.  For him to stop, Jimmy.  Kobe and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The latest from Nine Inch Nails. 
[00:49:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  We have more jingles that came in, by the way. 
[00:49:30]  This bit might be over as well, unfortunately.  I thought the jingles bit would have a little more life to it, Anthony.  Well, they're so awful.  I know, I know.  Most of them.  I don't think we got one real jingle where it really sounded like an authentic radio station jingle.  A couple were like goofs on a jingle, but not one real jingle.  I don't know about that.  No.  There was one.  Not a real jingle.  Yes, it was.  Which one?  I'll show you which one. 
[00:50:00]  Right?  That isn't a jingle.  That's a jingle.  Great jingle.  That is a great jingle for the show.  That doesn't sound like anything you'd play on another station.  Of course it does.  Just like those other jingles.  It's not. 
[00:50:30]  What about this one?  The Greg and Tony Show Greg and Tony Show Greg and Tony.  The Norton gets sex advice.  Wear no bag.  Spoke a hip.  It's an accent.  You know, I hear...  I like the unclear version.  Yeah, I like the unclear version.  I hear every word now.  That's the clear version.  That's definitely the clear version.  Oh, that was the clear version?  Yeah, that's the second one.  Oh, okay.  I like the original one.  I like them both, but I like the original a little bit better.  It's the Greg and Tony Show.  It's just creepier.  Greg and Tony Show.  All right, well, we have...  We got another at least 30 that came in. 
[00:51:00]  Jesus Christ, you people.  Don't you have jobs?  And I just heard a collective moan out there.  Don't worry.  We're not going to play all 30.  No.  We'll play about five or six tops.  We'll try a few of these out.  These were the ones that made the cut, just to show you how bad this bit has gotten.  Yeah.  Because these are awful as well.  This is Schnit Dick of North, N-O-R-F, North Carolina. 
[00:51:30]  Let me clear my throat!  What the fuck is your problem, lad?  I'll play Anthony on XM-202.  Monday through Friday, 7 to 11 with Jimmy Norton.  Now, Sparks and Stakes say, go to Daily to listen to Jim Norton's T-Sales.  Mmm, drop!  That voice is really creepy. 
[00:52:00]  He's trying to do the puker voice.  Well, but...  I don't know.  Hi.  I think he was attempting a puker voice.  That's not a jingle, though.  Not a jingle.  We shouldn't play ones that are not jingles.  Huh?  That might get people to actually make jingles.  They'll say, we won't play any that aren't jingles.  Well, yeah, that's more like a promo, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're looking for, like, the, you know, suck my fucking...  Yeah!  That's more a jingle, anyway. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  All right, here's Wool, Schmuck, and Law.  Their attempt at a O&A jingle.  Spring the virus, O-B-N-E-F-A-N-E.  2-2-X-N.  All right, boring as all hell, but it's a jingle.  Yeah, there's a jingle, at least.  See?  See?  You want jingles, that's what you get, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, something as boring as that.  Here's Fat Muffin Man. 
[00:53:00]  Shit on my chest, O-B-N-E.  That's a jingle.  That's a jingle.  It's kind of funny.  Mean-spirited?  Mean-spirited.  Not necessary.  I call it accurate.  Very excellent.  That's nice.  Let me hear that again.  Shit on my chest, O-B-N-E.  That's very good.  That's what we're looking for.  Things like that. 
[00:53:30]  Very short.  Yeah.  Jingle-like.  All right.  How about Drew from Canada?  It's the O-B-N-Anthony show on XM202.  Featuring Lil' Jimmy Narton.  Ramon, go spread the virus.  Ramon, go spread the virus.  Yeah.  Well, these are the better ones, believe it or not.  Let's see.  Wow.  A lot of them by Fat Muffin Man.  Fat Muffin Man, he has three that made the cut today.  Oh.  Not bad, Fat Muffin Man. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  A racist joke punchline.  I kind of like that.  What's the punchline?  I missed it.  He wasn't listening.  Jimmy wasn't listening.  I'm just reading this awful thing.  I'm sorry.  What are you?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll get into that in a second.  Play it again for Jimmy.  Oh, that one?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Now you can mess me up.  I've got to think on my feet now.  This stinks. 
[00:54:30]  Put velcro on the ceiling.  Oh.  Put velcro on the ceiling.  Oh, in here.  Okay.  And one more from the Muffin Man.  Fat Muffin Man.  Which way is north?  Oh.  Which way is north?  All right.  I like the variety in Jingle.  He has a nice musical variety.  Which is good.  Christ.  Downloaded one little clip of music.  Yeah, dude.  Could you have gotten the three different, subtly different clips? 
[00:55:00]  The exact same part of the exact same song?  Yeah.  I still like this one.  This one is still one of my favorites.  Oh.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  The OPN.  And turn the shot.  Oh.  It just goes right through.  Painful.  I'd like to find who sang that and then just swing a nice pot into their face.  A kitchen pot.  A heavy kitchen pot. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You know, like, as it swung, it would pick up momentum.  And then, bong.  Right against the shadow of those little teeth like chicklets.  Well, these two are so bad, I think we have to play them.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't even know who the first one is by, but he tried to do some kind of Gilligan's Island  parody song about the radio show.  Oh, no.  No.  You can't even recognize the words.  It's just awful.  So, join us now, you can hear a tale of an acid trip that started down in Old Beantown where 
[00:56:00]  the mayor goes to the town.  They prefer to walk the plank, jumps into Gotham town, pisses off everybody, nothing flat,  like a carry thing fucking in a church.  I wanted to hear the next verse. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, it was like a story.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  The weather only started getting rough after the couple of seconds in a church.  Nothing.  Not too accurate.  Never funny.  Anything to the Gilligan's Island song, or any other song from a TV show.  Stop it.  Right after he wrote that.  That's Patty Duke's show.  And it's funny, Joe. 
[00:57:00]  This just in, the Randy Johnson photo is now up on FARC.com.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, I sent it off to Drew, because I'm new at the whole photoshopping thing, so I sent  stuff to him to ask you.  You are such a shy angel.  What?  InstaShop, Randy Johnson's ass.  Yeah, I sent it off to him.  He said, yeah, this will work, so he puts it up there, and they're prodigies over there  with the photoshopping, so it should be interesting to see what they come up with.  All right, we'll see what they come up with.  Oh, does it say Randy Johnston?  Yeah, he wrote, InstaShop, Randy Johnston's ass, and someone said, who's Randy Johnston? 
[00:57:30]  He does look strikingly similar to the picture for the Yankees, Randy Johnson, though.  Do they mention that he just blew someone off for a picture?  I will tell him to put that out there.  Yeah, what's the use of having a picture of him just walking away without putting what  it was?  Thank you, Randy.  Just walk away.  Also, it's up on opianentony.com.  All right, here's another really bad jingle.  We'll just take a quick listen to this.  Every day on High Voltage XM 202, it's Puffy and Franny, and everyone's favorite fecal 
[00:58:00]  filiac, little Jimmy Norton.  Join us for plenty of Pusky, 806, and of course, delightful Franny singing popular songs of  the days of yore.  The Opie and Anthony Show, only on XM Satellite Radio.  You know what?  It's like a low-quality promo, sound-wise, but I kind of liked it.  But your sound-wise is pretty funny.  I don't know when I ever said that.  I hear stuff like that, and it's like, I know it's my voice, but I certainly don't remember 
[00:58:30]  saying anything about trannies from the days of yore.  It's like, when did I say that?  Days of yore.  All right.  Oh, you sprayed some deodorant, did you, Jimmy?  I did, because I packed my deodorant, because I'm on a plane this afternoon, so I had to...  Oh.  Smells good.  I'll say it does.  You're preaching in the choir.  I love them.  Right guard cool spray.  Yeah, we should get them to advertise on the show.  I'll spray that stuff every morning if they want to advertise.  See, that would be smart for a sponsor to do. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  Where they would get mentions on the show every day.  Yeah, because we had a...  Hey, did you spray?  We had a meeting about potential sales opportunities, and...  Yeah.  They want to do this thing called integration.  Yeah, integration, they call it.  It's a bad idea, because they'll be creating a mongrel race.  Ball races will be destroyed.  Like they do up in Harlem, or Chicago, or Detroit.  It's just another dumb corporate saying, or whatever you want to call it. 
[00:59:30]  It's corporate lingo, integration.  Here's why.  We did a great job over at NEW, bringing our sponsors in to be part of the show.  Some of them, because it just worked.  Sam Adams was one of those, where every day people were coming in, and we'd say...  Yeah, it got to the point where we wouldn't say, you want a beer?  We'd be like, hey, crack open to Sam for this guy.  Right.  That was...  Sam Adams was then integrated into the program.  Right.  They bought advertising, and then they were...  Yeah, there you go.  Part of the show, where we were mentioning them just because it just felt right. 
[01:00:00]  It felt right, not because sales was telling us to or anything.  It just felt right.  So they hear that, and then sales gets a brilliant idea to then tell the sponsors that the guys  can integrate your product into the show.  Right.  And it's like, it doesn't work that way.  It has to go the other way.  We had a lot of sex going on on the old show.  So it was like, oh, before that couple of fucks in front of us in the corner there,  why don't you have some...  Why don't you give them some horny goat weed?  Horny goat weed. 
[01:00:30]  Remember the...  It's the stacker, too.  Exactly.  Things like that just fit.  It just fit, yeah.  But they're trying to do this with products that are like, what?  Oh, there's some people that are like, look, guys, there's a lug wrench company that wants  to come on board.  They sell quality lug wrenches.  Part of the deal is they want to integrate their product on your show.  Do you think you'd be able to mention lug wrenches every day on the show?  What?  Do you think you could incorporate the lug wrench into your show every day?  Yeah, we could...  What?  We could kill a hooker every day with our wrench. 
[01:01:00]  Can we just beat her about the teeth with a lug wrench?  Well, they have one, and we love the product.  Yeah.  We really do.  The Liberator?  Yeah.  They want us to integrate the Liberator into our program.  And we probably could.  How?  That seems like a product.  Hey, bend an intern over it every day.  That's what I'm saying.  Yes.  That's right.  It's all guys around here.  Will we use the Liberator when hot chicks stop by?  That'll give a reason now to have chicks come in, because they could use the Liberator.  The Liberator is the sex pillow. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  It's shaped like a wedge.  It gives you that perfect angle.  Yeah, you put a chick over it.  The old G-spot.  The old G-spot.  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Nice.  I could see the Liberator, though, because it would be in the studio on a daily basis,  somehow getting a mention like that.  Something about the Liberator I could see, maybe not every day, but a lot of days I could  see it getting a mention.  Right.  Just off the side, someone screws up and, you know, bend over the Liberator like a bad boy. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Anthony, speaking of the Liberator, Gamefly.com.  Oh!  Gamefly.com.  Liberate yourself from boredom.  Oh, there you go.  We love Gamefly.com.  Liberate yourself from buying bad video games.  The point is, all of a sudden you hear us try to make it sound natural before we go  into a commercial read, and, you know, sometimes it's hard.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, we don't want it to sound awkward or anything.  Gamefly is cool because I do play a lot of games, and I do enjoy the product. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, that's a smart one, but some that they come to the table with, a little off.  This whole concept of integrating stuff into the program.  Oof.  It needs some work.  Yeah.  It needs some work, boys and girls, down there in Washington.  All right, Anthony, we didn't have time.  We got in here late today, unfortunately.  We have three brand new jingles that Steve just handed me.  Usually we, at this point, we try to listen to these before we go on the air.  At least a piece of them.  Yeah.  Know what we're getting into.  Because there's so many that are just so bad, there's no entertainment value whatsoever.  Yeah.  So we spare you guys, but I don't know. 
[01:03:00]  There's three quick ones.  You want to just do it fast on the air?  Sure.  All right.  I'm scared by the title of the first one.  It's called Dead Children.  From Jeremy.  From Jeremy.  Children.  From Jeremy.  Mm-hmm.  His attempt at an O&A jingle.  The only show with the balls left by your dad's children.  The only adaption. 
[01:03:30]  Wait.  Don't make me play that again.  I want to hear it again.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Shut up.  Shut up, Jimmy.  It was okay.  You are the worst.  No, it wasn't that bad.  And you could just see in his face.  Here's another one from Jeremy.  It's awful.  It's called Norton and Friends.  Ooh.  I like it.  Put on your robe and slippers again.  It's time for Norton and Friends. 
[01:04:00]  This is fun.  Oh, my God.  I just don't like that.  Good job, son.  I hate when the listeners kill our bits off.  This is horrible.  I disagree.  I think there were some good riffs in that one.  You like that one?  I sure did.  We had so many great Bob Kelly remixes, and then, you know, a couple bad ones come in  from the listeners, and that's the end of the bit.  I'm thinking this might be the end of the O&A jingle bit.  There is no talent at all in those. 
[01:04:30]  There's no, and there's an opportunity for singing talent, music talent as far as playing  the instrument, writing talent, acting talent, dancing talent.  That is devoid of talent.  There's nothing there.  You can't blame the listeners for killing the bit, though.  It's the laziness of this program.  Of course it is.  You know what I think is going on here?  I think Steve doesn't feel too secure with his job, because Steve, Martini Steve, is responsible 
[01:05:00]  for all the production on this radio show.  You are giving the listeners much too much credit here.  So I'm thinking that Steve has hidden all the really good ones.  All the gems, the gold that they're sending in.  All the good O&A jingle gems, because he wants job security.  Steve, comment?  Interesting theory.  False.  They could quite easily email you two their jingles.  Oh, there you go.  How good do you feel about your talent at this point? 
[01:05:30]  How about you one, not me, not you two?  I don't need to go through that crap.  Yeah, exactly.  I give, I have maybe, I tried to filter them out, but the level of stomach bile that was  coming out of these things, it was just disgusting.  So you don't filter them anymore.  So I'm giving you guys everything that comes in.  All right.  What's this one from Frank about the war jingle?  The war jingle.  It's a lot of explosions and babies crying, as far as I remember. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God.  This is the one that could wreck the bit.  Uh-huh.  This could end the bit right here.  Oh, the last one?  Yeah.  What the fuck is this? 
[01:06:30]  What is this?  Let me hear your war jingle.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  It's over, Johnny.  God damn it, are you fucking with me? 
[01:07:00]  What was that?  I have no idea what that was.  That's what comes in.  Wow.  Over and over again.  That lunatic was sitting there thinking that this is good.  Yeah, this will work.  Yeah.  Right in the garbage.  Good.  I missed.  All right, well.  Wow.  Thanks, Frank, for ruining another Opie and Anthony bit.  Good one.  Brian in Virginia, what's up? 
[01:07:30]  Man, I'm glad that just killed this bit, man,  because y'all have been giving me reoccurring dreams.  Every time you played a Greg and Tony show, Greg and Tony show,  I see, I have this dream of you guys with little Jimmy and a boat carrying Chester like the Johnny Quest,  because that music for it comes from the Johnny Quest cartoon, the end of it.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I thought that was familiar.  Every time.  I went a week and a half and hear no dreams,  and then all of a sudden y'all play that shit today.  You're killing me, guys.  You're killing me.  All right, Brian.  All right, man.  Thank you. 
[01:08:00]  The Greg and Tony show, Greg.  The Tony show, Greg.  The Tony got stuck.  The Norton with sex advice.  Wear no bag.  Spread the hip.  Big son.  XM.  Isn't that the clear version, too?  Yeah.  No, I know.  I can't find the other version.  Can't find the other version?  That's the good version.  Well, how about snapping and telling Hawk to get up and find that version?  Hawk?  Hawk?  It's somewhere.  That's a good answer.  It's somewhere.  Well, it looks like Eric is rifling under that mess of stuff over there.  Why don't we neaten that area up? 
[01:08:30]  Why don't we get to it?  Opie hasn't really given the order to neaten up the console lately.  And they're hiding stuff behind your monitor.  I gave up.  There's a big pile back there.  I gave up.  We have 15 people working for the show now.  We can't keep the studio clean.  Look how messy that is behind your monitor.  They're trying to pull one over on you.  They're hiding stuff back there.  Oh, I know.  They're hiding the yams, so I'll eat them.  It's funny because that's what they do.  Yeah.  I mean, we all have our foibles in the studio. 
[01:09:00]  Foibles?  What's a foible?  Didn't Aesop write them?  Isn't it a bobble?  No, it's a foible.  We have foibles, right?  Look up the definition for foible.  It's like corks and stuff, no?  A foible is a cork?  I don't know.  Look it up.  Look it up!  The Greg and Tony Show Greg and Tony Show Greg and Tony Gap Doc.  The Norton with sex advice.  Wear no bag.  Spread the hip.  It's a hexane.  Way to find another copy of the clear version. 
[01:09:30]  That's the same one.  Thanks, Eric.  Not the only one.  Thank you.  There's one where you can barely make it out.  That's still the same one.  Three in a row.  The same one.  Three of the same version on three different CDs.  Jesus.  How about this Markham Rice?  What do you think of them apples?  It's this one, buddy.  You got it?  I'm going to take a chance, but I think it's this one.  This is the fourth.  Well, it's not.  This is the fourth version of the Greg and Tony jingle.  I think this one might be the original. 
[01:10:00]  That's the one.  I think so, because Eric was about to get a nice log in his hat.  All right, well.  Did you look up foibles for me?  Foible.  F-O-I-B-L-E.  Foible.  The weaker part of a sword's blade.  No. 
[01:10:30]  Stop.  It's an adjective, too.  A behavioral attribute that is distinctive and peculiar to an individual.  That's a noun, though.  That's not a bad adjective, is it?  We've each got our foibles here.  Yeah, that would work, Opie.  I was sweating that one.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you were distracted earlier because this is a huge story that's on the front page of the New York Post today.  This performance artist.  I hate performance artist, by the way. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, stop it.  Can't define what it is you do.  Shithead.  Performance artist.  It's always tough when you start talking about art, you know, because it's, I don't know.  People want to try to define what art is, and then you get, like, Mayor Giuliani, back in the day, trying to tell everyone what is art and what's not art.  Right.  So it's really tough when you go down this road.  You want to try to leave the whole art thing alone.  Performance artists are the people that want to be famous but have no talent. 
[01:11:30]  They want to be artists.  They have no talent at all to do anything, so they are performance artists.  Like the guy who wrote soy on his chest and runs through the events.  Yes, soy bomb.  Yeah.  Wow, man.  You're really bucking the system, man.  Yeah.  Man.  I'm a performance artist, man.  I never try to, like, define an individual's art.  I will.  Da Vinci was an artist.  Michelangelo was an artist.  Rockwell was an artist.  Right. 
[01:12:00]  There you go.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Exactly.  I mean, but this story is pissing off myself, everyone in the studio, and certainly a lot  of New Yorkers out there.  Basically, a Brooklyn artist evoked the images of people who leaped to their deaths from the  World Trade Center by repeatedly jumping off a Chicago museum, outraging the families  of some 9-11 victims.  Some?  Probably all of them.  Of course.  Probably all of them.  Curry, last name I can't pronounce, who wore a safety harness under his clothes, told 
[01:12:30]  the Daily News that Tuesday's stunt was his way of asking questions about what went  through the minds of those who jumped from the towers and others who watched helplessly.  What a pompous asshole.  And by the way, there's a brilliant article by Neil Steinberg in the Daily News, a phony  artist in his dopey, insulting stunt, where he just deconstructs what a fraud this guy  is, not just because what he did is tasteless, but because it's not art.  It's just a pompous asshole trying to look deep and involved, and he's really a self-involved 
[01:13:00]  boob.  Yeah.  Yeah, just garbage.  Was his way of asking questions about what went through the minds of those who jumped?  Do we have to question what was in the minds of those people that jumped?  Are you crazy?  I don't think you've got to question it.  But that's not what he's doing anyway.  If it was a legitimate question that would show insight into someone's mind, I would love  to know, what are you thinking?  Yeah.  But that's not what he was doing.  It's a guy that's hiding behind the art to get famous, like Anthony's doing.  And he knows he's going to get the shock value, but he has to have some deep artistic 
[01:13:30]  answers, so you go, wow, man, this guy really cared, man.  You're a fucking phony, dude.  You're a fraud.  What kind of sick individual is he, asks Rose Marie of Midwood, Brooklyn, who lost her  son.  Tell him to go jump off the Empire State Building and see how it feels.  He's an artist.  Go paint a bowl of fruit or something.  That's a great quote.  That is a great quote.  Exactly, pompous idiot.  Get a paintbrush and shut your mouth.  He jumped with a harness.  Of course he did.  You know, why don't you commit, buddy? 
[01:14:00]  There you go.  Why don't you commit to your art?  This guy in this article says something about how fraudulent that is, that that's like  saying that it's like putting on like a hospital gurney or something and then thinking that  you've tapped into what it's like to be really sick.  Yeah, yeah.  It ain't going to happen.  It's not.  If a guy did an artist's transition of somebody jumping, if he painted it or something, that's  one thing.  But you're lying about what your motives are.  You're looking for attention.  Performance artists are the absolute worst.  They're in comedy. 
[01:14:30]  They're all over.  They run around.  They try to say like really shocking anti-government things.  You're supposed to go, whoa, this guy really doesn't march to the same beat as the rest  of us.  Yeah.  You're a predictable dullard.  He hired a crew of photographers, captured him in midair, arms and legs flailing wildly.  Some of the images will end up in gallery catalogs and museum walls.  And he's selling them.  Part of a series of pictures to be called Life Goes On.  And he's selling them.  He's not doing, he's not trying to investigate what he's doing. 
[01:15:00]  He's selling them for a lot of money.  He's doing something that's being sensationalist and he's trying to make money off of it.  Is there any way to get this guy in the air today?  We should have been working on it at six.  I don't know.  I'm trying to, just hopefully they're.  Yeah.  Another guy who lost employees, his fellow employees, he says in this article, my friends  jumped out of buildings and it wasn't an art form.  Uh, it was a last resort.  The mayor called this guy nauseatingly offensive. 
[01:15:30]  Scarbacca said he was horrified when he saw the attacks on TV.  He started taking pictures of himself falling from trees, roofs and ladders, winning him  art world praise.  What art world praise is he getting for doing this?  I am so happy they are yanking funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  I am so fucking happy you pompous assholes can fund your own crap. 
[01:16:00]  I think that's what, I'm not saying the NEA is funding this asshole.  I'm an artist.  I gotta fund myself.  I never got money to be a pompous jerk off and urinate into a jar and call it piss Christ.  You guys suck.  I like the piss Christ.  Me too, it was tasty.  I, uh...  Well, you left with a little crucifix like a tequila worm when you're done.  I like a swizzle stick.  I enjoy, uh, looking at a painting every once in a while.  I'm a fan of Pablo Picasso and his work and sometimes I go to the museum and I see a nice 
[01:16:30]  little portrait of, uh, of like George Washington done back in the day.  Yeah, there you go.  And you look at the painting and it's in, and you see the date, very old stuff and it's  like, oh, look at that.  But the art world in general, I remember when it was still wet paint.  Sign over, wet paint.  I love art, man, if it's done well.  Thank you, Gretel.  I respect art and a great artist.  But why should, again, National Endowment of the Arts, I mean, I'm not saying they're  tied in, but it all ties to the arrogance of most of these motherfuckers.  Why should we fund your crap?  No one funded me. 
[01:17:00]  I did it myself.  There you go.  Who was paying my rent while I was out?  Well, not, you know, not according to these pompous jizz buckets.  But why would you just, oh, I hate them.  Here's a couple more quotes really fast.  First of all, this guy did it 30 times, Anthony.  30 times while a crowd of hundreds watched.  Why didn't one of those people have a fucking gun with a scope?  They probably didn't know what he was doing.  They probably didn't understand what he was doing.  Yeah, because if he announced what he was doing before he did it, oh, it would have been  a different reaction from the people on the street.  He didn't do it in New York.  They would have started throwing, yeah, there you go. 
[01:17:30]  There's, yeah, exactly.  Not only hiding behind his art, he doesn't even do it in the city that it happened in.  And showing pictures of himself falling.  Like, here's one of him falling off a ladder, one of him falling off a building, which is  obviously unrelated.  Those are fine as an artist.  I'm not saying it's not an interesting piece of a human action to take a photo of.  My problem is the way this selfish, pompous asshole is trying to tie himself into 9-11. 
[01:18:00]  Right, take pictures of yourself falling.  Here he is.  I'm looking at a picture of him falling off a ladder.  Yeah.  And it is an interesting photo, I must say.  Absolutely.  I know exactly what happened here.  The guy came up with a great concept as far as in the art world, you know, pictures of  me falling off objects, like Ann said, off a ladder here, falling kind of off a porch  and another one here and another one kind of throwing himself out of an open structure  into the water, it looks like it's going to be.  So he probably had this, he's probably been doing this for a while and getting no attention 
[01:18:30]  whatsoever.  Right.  So he said, wow, falling, hmm, falling.  Oh, oh, people fell out, you know.  And somebody probably told him, looked at one of the pictures and went, wow, that looks  like, you know, you're falling from a building and, you know.  Right.  He probably got the idea.  Oh, yeah, building.  Well, wow.  If I jump, if I fall from a building and say I'm doing it for the 9-11 victims and stuff,  well, now I'm going to get attention from my artwork.  That's exactly what happened.  And make some money.  That's exactly what was going through his head.  Because no one was paying any attention to his photos of him falling. 
[01:19:00]  And now, look, he did his job because now we're all talking about it.  Yeah, but we're not talking about him the way you want to be talked about.  We're talking about where you hope somebody just fucking gets their house burned down.  Did you read this quote, Anthony?  I thought it was my responsibility to respond to 9-11, he said.  This happened to be my response to that.  My sheer inability to do anything about watching people fall.  My lack of control over the situation.  The situation.  Ugh.  You phony.  Yep. 
[01:19:30]  God, most artists are phony.  Most of you are fraudulent, self-involved phonies.  You're so obsessed with your own point of view and you think that it's just so deep to the rest of us and we don't give a shit.  You want to take responsibility for 9-11?  We would talk calm if we're talking about it fucking a week after it happened.  Not five years.  We didn't wait five years.  To all of a sudden try to get our shit noticed by mentioning it. 
[01:20:00]  Faggot.  God, wow.  This is an interesting quote from Mindy of East Brunswick, New Jersey.  As crazy as it is, we all have the right to do that, said Mindy, who lost her husband Alan.  I'm just not exactly sure what he's trying to get from that.  No one is saying that constitutionally he's not allowed, Mindy.  No one is saying that his rights should be removed or he should be imprisoned.  We're just saying he's an asshole.  All I'm saying is we should have the right to punch him square in the face when we see him walking down the streets of New York. 
[01:20:30]  Because of the pompousness of it.  Right.  Because of the fraudulent bullshit.  How about this, if he was just jumping and he said, look man, I've always been fascinated by people that jump out windows and suicide, I don't know how you do it.  That wouldn't bother me as much because you're not looking for attention by tying yourself into a specific event that really rocked the country.  And Jimmy, he's a coward because it says here he said he didn't mean to offend anyone in New York where he moved last year.  So he's been living in this city for about a year. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, he wasn't even here.  Yeah, he's in Chicago.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, no, we said that already.  You know, why don't you really commit and do it in New York and see what kind of reaction you would have gotten instead of hiding in another city.  No, I mean he wasn't here during the attack.  Oh, no.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Wasn't even here for the attack.  No, he just moved here.  But he decides to take this stunt to another city where he knew he'd be a lot safer.  Trying to tie himself into 9-11 just for attention.  That's what makes me sick.  That's what makes everybody sick.  I mean, it's not just me.  It's just, you know, everybody's hearing us. 
[01:21:30]  So there you have it.  Well, his last name, give it out.  I'll give you his name because this is not the type of press you want.  Kerry Scarbacca.  S-K-R-B-A-K-K-A.  Kerry Scarbacca.  That is the name of this jizz bag.  And you go to scarbacca.com.  And, yeah, you got a contact.  Oh, there you go.  So I guess you can get a hold of him some way.  Look at his biography.  God, I hate performance artists.  Studied sculpture and painting.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, and obviously he was too bad at that.  Of course he was.  He couldn't do anything with sculpture and painting.  So he's got to do these photos.  Maybe Patrick Swayze could sit closely behind you while you make a pot, faggot.  Went to Japan for a couple of years where he worked in a bar and formed the beginnings of an art career.  There you go.  Yeah, worked in a bar after he failed at painting and sculpting.  Worked in a bar in Japan.  Returned home.  Left the States for South America to photograph. 
[01:22:30]  A year later, I returned to experience the demise of my mother from brain cancer.  You said, why didn't you throw yourself in Jell-O and say you wanted to experience being a tumor, stupid?  Put on a white hat and sit in a big tub of Jell-O.  Or how about some, why don't you get a fucking, a big tub of like, of oatmeal and sit in that.  There you go.  And pretend you're a brain stem surrounded by frustration and crying relatives.  Tee-hee-hee. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, do that.  Do something a little more personal.  Huh?  That's what art is.  Lay there in a bed while someone hits you on the head with a ball-peen hammer and be in pain.  And then say, well, I'm just somebody with brain cancer.  Or how about this, if you want to emulate that.  Lay there with your mouth half open and then have your black friend come in and teabag you pretending he's an orderly  and you want to scream and yell help, but you can't because you're laying there.  You want to emulate a real sick person.  Your speech has been taken away by a tumor.  That's right. 
[01:23:30]  There you go.  Stop trying to look deep and travel the world, you dope.  The phones have exploded.  It's Sally in Illinois.  What's up, Sally?  Hi.  Well, he could have thrown himself into helping old people, too, when his mom was dying of cancer.  My question was, I know what the people were thinking.  They were thinking before they jumped whether they wanted to be burned to death or whether they wanted to be flattened.  Yeah.  And did he light a fire behind him so that he had the actual feeling of it?  No, you can't find legitimacy in this.  Your argument's logical.  He's a fraud.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And also, what they say is, what psychologists have said about people that jumped, because 
[01:24:00]  I'm afraid of heights.  I've stood in tall buildings and looked and went, my God, I'm 50 floors up.  People jumped twice as high.  Just the horror that washes over you.  It's an instinct thing.  Just the horror of looking over.  Yeah.  You don't make a conscious decision of what you're going to do and say, I'm doing it.  There's no choice in the matter.  The heat is so intense.  It's an instinct thing to get away from it.  That's what I've heard.  There's no logical thought that goes into throwing yourself out a window.  You become like a trapped animal at that point.  Your logic is just...  I mean, that's what psychologists... 
[01:24:30]  You're backing away from fire until there's nothing else under your feet, is what it is.  And I guess maybe you do make that one decision, like, well, this is less painful than that.  But some arrogant, just little scumbag jumping out of a fourth-story window while people photograph him, man.  Yeah.  Boy, that really puts you in the mindset of those people, doesn't it?  Yeah.  No.  You're exactly what's wrong with artists.  You're a pompous dummy who wants to get a little bit of attention and is trying to tie himself into something disingenuously.  That's what you are, scumbag.  All right, Pat from New York has a problem with Norton. 
[01:25:00]  Who cares?  Pat?  Yes, sir?  What's the problem?  Well, listen, this man has made money on making fun of people his entire career.  Yes.  I feel he's a hypocrite.  Why?  Is this you, Jim?  Yeah.  Um, you're just, uh, you're making fun of this guy's artwork.  He's, uh...  He's a shithead and he's a fraud.  Here, let me cut you off before you...  I know what you're going to say.  If I've capitalized by making money off these things, why shouldn't he? 
[01:25:30]  Because what I do...  No, it's not that.  Whatever it is.  Oh, what is it?  What is it?  It's the fact that he should have the ability.  I mean, art is all about, um, invoking an emotion.  He does have the ability.  He does have the ability and he's doing it.  And no one's going to take his art away from him.  His art.  No one's going to take it away.  Uh, we're just saying he's a phony.  He's a fraud.  He's a shithead.  He's hiding behind the fact that it's art.  I don't believe it's art at this point.  But like I said, to start this conversation, to start defining art, that's when you get yourself in trouble. 
[01:26:00]  But, my opinion, he's really hiding behind his art.  And he didn't even commit.  He didn't do it in New York where it actually happened.  Yeah, so you guys are making fun of women drowning their children?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Why not?  The news media...  Well, dude, the news media capitalizes.  Why shouldn't we?  I'm not saying...  No, it's not about that.  I'm telling you that's why I feel comfortable doing it.  I'm telling you that's why.  Don't tell me it's not about that.  Anyone, you especially, should see what he's doing.  Yeah, and we...  I know what he's doing.  It's fraudulent.  And we're then going on the air after we tool on tragedies and saying, 
[01:26:30]  we're only doing this to really show people the horror that was behind drowning your children.  Yeah, that's the reason we're doing it.  That's always what we preach on this show, isn't it?  Yeah, we don't hide.  Jackass.  We're not hiding.  We're not hiding behind some kind of phony fucking logic  behind what we do, idiot.  We're on the air here cracking jokes and being jackasses,  and we're honest about it.  What?  Do you know what his motivation was?  Yes.  What's his motivation?  Well, you're assuming it's money. 
[01:27:00]  How do you know it's money?  Because he's selling the shit.  It's attention, dude.  He couldn't get attention.  I'm answering you.  He couldn't get attention in the right way.  He couldn't get attention being a legitimate artist, so he decided, well, this will get my name out there.  People will be checking out my website and my other photographs, and I am selling this stuff.  So now he's making money off of that.  Like, dude, dude, let me ask you.  Do you really believe...  God bless him.  I just hope he walks down the streets of New York and one of these NYPD guys recognizes him  and punches him in the face nice and hard.  Dude, do you really believe that this pompous idiot jumping out of a fourth floor window 
[01:27:30]  and getting attention and getting photographed is a real getting to the minds of 9-11 victims?  I'm asking you just man to man.  Do you really buy that?  Yeah, because that's what he's hiding behind.  We don't hide behind anything.  We show you all the scars that...  Was that his audience?  Huh?  Was that his audience?  Just the victims?  No, no, no.  Dude, I'm asking you.  Do you...  What I'm saying to you is this.  You believe the logic.  Do you believe what he's saying, that when he jumped out this fourth floor window  and got photographed saying he's trying to get into the minds of these victims,  do you buy that bullshit? 
[01:28:00]  No, no, no, no.  You don't believe it?  That's all we're saying.  That's what we're saying.  That's what we're saying today.  We may be showing people...  Dude, you just agreed with us.  ...what was happening.  What's your problem?  ...evoking emotion.  Dude, you agreed with us.  You agreed with us.  And evoking emotion, but to me you have to do that through some kind of a talent with your art.  Like me running around screaming the N-word at people.  I mean, I'm being serious.  That would evoke an emotion, but is that art?  At least when I try to get an emotion out of people, dude, 
[01:28:30]  I try to do it through what I'm good at, which is being funny.  You understand what I'm saying?  Like I have gallows humor, and that's what I do.  All right, laughter is an emotion.  But my motives...  Well, he's got you guys.  No, no, no.  My motives are honest about what I'm doing.  This guy is not...  If this guy was painting, or to me, doing something genuine about 9-11,  that people had a problem with...  Like, Rudy Giuliani was wrong to go after that person who did something with the Virgin Mary,  because I think the person was being genuine, and Giuliani was wrong.  I don't buy what this guy is doing. 
[01:29:00]  That's why I have a problem with it.  Listen, I would like to hear him say that he's, you know, he's donating his money.  I don't care what he does with his money.  That's his business.  He's a fraud because he's...  Does that make it legitimate then?  No.  All right, Pat.  No, Pat, you just...  Your time is up.  Thank you.  Yeah, you said what you had to say, and then you agreed with us.  Oh, God, that guy annoyed me.  Because he's just...  Pat's like, well, you are...  We know that stupid.  Because they always try to make you sound like a hypocrite.  Well, look what you guys are doing.  Yeah.  Yeah, what?  We come in here, and like Jimmy said, we have gallows humor.  We do.  We make jokes about awful, horrible things. 
[01:29:30]  But we're not hiding behind some explanation like we're doing it to expose how awful these things are.  This guy, if he wanted to take pictures of himself falling out a window and saying,  Hey, this is, you know, doesn't this guy, a picture of me, look like the guy that tumbled out the window?  And you'd look and go, yeah.  And you'd go, boy, you're great for pointing that out, asshole.  But at least he wouldn't be trying to explain it away with some kind of phony, let's get in touch with their feelings bullshit. 
[01:30:00]  Stop it.  So we're not hypocrites, Pat.  We're exactly the opposite.  We are truthful about what we do.  And I know, do you think I don't know that some of the things I say are in poor taste?  Of course they are.  I know they are.  But I'm not standing on a street corner and then telling people that I'm trying to heal myself because of 9-11, man.  I'm not that big of a phony.  Let's go to Dave in Philly.  Dave?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you know, this guy can do what he does and call it art.  And, you know, why can't I be an inspiring artist and say, I want to knock this guy the fuck out because I think that's art, him laying on the ground in a bloody pool, you know? 
[01:30:30]  I agree with you.  I'm going to be, I have decided to become an artist.  I'm going to have a whole collection of me punching people really hard in the face.  And, Jimmy, for once, you're going to be taking the pictures.  And I'm going to start with this guy.  And that's going to be my art, what people feel when they're getting a fist in the middle of their face.  Hey, fuck that.  All right, Dave.  If he painted a picture, if he painted a screaming face of somebody falling, something that you look at and go, wow, all right, this guy, this is what he's doing. 
[01:31:00]  We just don't buy, I don't personally buy his motives.  I think he's a liar.  All right, let's go to Sean in Staten Island.  Sean?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, make it fast.  The phones have exploded.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just calling to comment on this, man, because I worked at the Trade Center for three months after they fell.  I worked for the Department of Sanitation.  And, you know, from a person who, with my own eyes, saw people jumping out of the buildings and the buildings coming down, I mean, this just totally, absolutely sickens me.  And that guy before trying to legitimize what this guy was doing, he deserves a punch in the face as well. 
[01:31:30]  I never have anything bad to say about these guys.  I love these guys.  I've been listening to these guys for years, man.  And I have no problems with you, you know, trashing people for what you don't like that they do.  But by giving this guy this much air time, he's just going to, you know, have people go to his site and look into it more and actually make this guy some money, you know?  You know what, though, dude?  People say that all press is good press, but that's not always the case.  This guy is doing such a scumbag move.  I know, exactly, man.  And you know what, like, I swear to God, you're exactly right. 
[01:32:00]  This guy did a shit and should have done it in New York because if he was there, I would have stomped him to death.  Yeah, I mean, it just proves that he knew what he was doing.  I mean, if he really wanted to do this, he would have done it in New York City where it happened.  He's trying to light a fire under a failed art career by using the World Trade Center tragedy, and it's not working.  And doesn't it figure that just most of those fucking, those joiners, to quote Penn Jillette, and those faggots in the art community, and I don't mean sexually, would back him? 
[01:32:30]  Like, no one in the art community would ever have the moral courage to go, Jesus, this guy's an asshole.  Yeah, they look at it and go, well, you know, if he says it's art, we have to support it.  Sure we do.  Like, someone's just got to say it's art in order for that whole community to get behind it no matter what.  How about this?  It's not art if anybody can do it.  What's the definition of art?  I don't know, but I can tell you what it's not.  If any of us can do it, like piss Christ, it's not art.  Everyone can't be funny.  Everyone can't be, can't sing.  Everyone can't paint beautifully. 
[01:33:00]  Everyone can't sculpt.  That's what makes it special.  That's what makes art, to me, even conceptual art, which I don't like.  I think Picasso stinks, but I recognize he's a great artist.  No, no, no, I don't like him.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I recognize that he's a great artist.  What about his blue period?  Well, that's a little bit different.  But you know what I'm saying?  I don't like him, but I recognize it.  When Pablo Picasso started...  Because the head's never the right size, Hope.  Well, that's right.  No, no.  They all look like Ben.  This is the...  See, if you study... 
[01:33:30]  Big hogs.  Big head.  Not that I study Pablo Picasso.  I just know basic facts about him, okay?  There was a period where he was actually drawing and painting real shit.  But he got into that stage where all of a sudden, like, there was an eye that was square on the  chick's forehead, and the nose was down where the chin should be, and, you know, we've all  seen the really weird shit.  I don't get that at all.  To me, that's like another artist, you know what I mean?  Because he drastically changed.  But there was stuff he did before that that was just pretty amazing.  By the way, look at his headshot.  Just look at the head...  If you can see the headshot on the Daily News, it's the deep, sultry, head-tilted look. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yes.  Like, every fucking wannabe actor in the city, this guy is just awful.  He's awful.  A complete wannabe.  What happened with getting him on the phone?  We can't?  He's not going to do this job.  A lot of people are pointing this out also, that he's the guy falling off the ladders  and falling off of rooftops and stuff like that.  He's the model.  He isn't even the guy who's taking the picture.  Exactly.  Who's doing the photograph-affing? 
[01:34:30]  Who's doing the photograph-affing?  That's a good point, yeah.  You know, he's not even...  He's doing the falling.  He's the guy in the picture.  He's a clown school graduate.  Yeah.  Doing pratfalls.  Pratfalls.  Stupid.  Don't you hire someone to do that part of it if you're an artist?  Yeah.  Live from New York, it's Saturday night.  And then fall down like Chevy Chase.  Why don't you tumble down a JCPenney escalator?  Call yourself an artist.  Someone can take pictures of it.  Yuck.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Yes.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  One of the things that everybody's been talking about, 
[01:35:00]  and it's kind of spun off of this,  you know, we brought up, you know,  humor and bad taste and everything.  And one thing that the theory, guys,  whenever another comedian's in there,  you're always shining light on yourselves  as well as what's going on out in the world, too.  So it kind of makes it okay because,  hey, look, these people are fucked up,  but, you know, when something goes wrong in the studio,  you're quick to jump on one another, too,  just to show everybody's inconsistencies. 
[01:35:30]  Well, this is what, I mean, again,  I quote Colin from when he closed Tough Crab.  And I wish I heard the audio of it.  I have it somewhere.  One of the greatest things I've ever heard of it,  and, again, it's not just comics.  It's any artist.  But Colin said that what he likes about comics  is that, like, you point out the hypocrisies  and awful things about the world  and what's wrong with it  and that you're still honest enough  to admit that you're as guilty  as anybody else in the game.  Oh, bravo.  I was going to say that.  You know what I mean?  In the end, we're all hypocrites.  We're all guilty of the same bullshit, sure.  To a point, you know,  but I think Anthony and I and Jimmy now, 
[01:36:00]  I think we've done a good job over the years  not trying to hide behind what we do.  It's a pretty honest show,  and it's a pretty raw show,  and you see all the bad in all of us  and the scars and stuff.  We don't try to hide anything, you know?  If these guys want to make fun of dead babies,  they make fun of dead babies.  They're not hiding behind a reason why they're doing it.  They just, you know,  they go for the laugh,  think it's funny,  and someone out there is laughing over it.  Simple as that.  Guys, you're doing a great job,  and I'm going to punch out now.  All right. 
[01:36:30]  Thank you, mister.  Yep.  That's funny.  Split P from Wackback.  If we stop taking pictures of ourselves  jumping off ladders,  the terrorists win.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Fucking pop his boob.  Fuck.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  Can I look up his number and information?  Yeah, we're trying to find him.  We're trying to find him.  I'm sure he's very busy today.  A lot of phone calls. 
[01:37:00]  This guy's probably loving the attention, man.  Loving it.  I wonder if he bargained.  You know what, though?  In the end,  he'll have to look at himself in the mirror  and realize he's just a fraud.  In the end,  he'll realize that,  oh my God,  I did this sensationalist thing  to try to get my artwork sold  and in the end,  no one's going to buy his shit.  His sales will spike for a little while  and then he'll just fade into just oblivion.  Somebody will throw paint on his art.  No one will care.  No one will burn his gallery down.  How great would that be? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, jump out the window, artist.  Get a picture of that.  Fanning your shit.  Throwing some water on it.  This is called pompous boob.  Tries to salvage everything.  Why did I say boob  in the middle of a good run?  Boob.  Pompous boob.  That's if you're a breast  at a French museum.  A boob.  If he's lucky,  someday someone will bring this up  and someone will go,  oh, yeah, that guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  People were talking about him  for a week.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  This guy will get a little attention.  Somebody will punch him in the face. 
[01:38:00]  9-11.  Guys that do shit like this at 9-11  really annoy the public.  Yes, they do.  All right.  Why does he take a picture of himself  walking away from a starstruck little fan?  Aw, how about that?  Another tragedy.  Let's go to JC in North Carolina.  JC?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hello, Jimmy.  Hi, JC.  I agree with you guys.  They're being hypocritical.  The guy's being hypocritical  because he's tied himself to 9-11.  But I am pissed off at you guys  because for some reason  it seems like all New Yorkers  think that they own 9-11 
[01:38:30]  because the World Trade Centers are there.  But that's not the only incident  that happened that day.  I understand.  I understand.  Hundreds of thousands  or thousands of people  lost their lives there.  Yeah.  You know,  we personally know  hundreds and hundreds of people  that were involved  with the whole, you know,  towers collapsing in New York City.  During this whole conversation  I was very careful  and I think the other guys here  not to, you know,  personalize this  and say,  oh my God,  we know a ton of NYPD guys  and fire guys  that lost their, you know,  their brothers.  I tried to stay away from that  to be honest with you. 
[01:39:00]  So it's interesting  you're calling in with that.  I understand that,  but that was the feeling  that I got from this country.  And anybody that lives in the city,  they do have a little more  involvement in 9-11  than anyone else in the country.  Sorry.  That's just the way it is.  All New Yorkers  don't think they own 9-11.  But there is a little,  you're a little more  personally involved in it  that when you actually  watched these things fall  than somebody that was  a thousand miles away  watching on television.  I'm sorry.  He's also saying that  there's not enough attention 
[01:39:30]  being brought to the people  of Washington  and that field  of Pennsylvania.  Absolutely.  I think part of it,  to be honest with you,  part of it is  that, you know,  there was a reality  that the buildings  were so large  and we had film of it.  I mean, you could see,  you couldn't see the Pentagon  or the shootout.  And you know something,  the Pentagon's still there,  my friend.  It's not a ditch  in the ground  that used to have  a couple of landmarks  on it.  Don't fucking ditch up,  dude, now.  Stop dicking around  and make some plans.  Well, we're trying to.  The reality is that  stupid politicians.  The reality is  the tower's falling,  you know,  as outrageous as this is, 
[01:40:00]  trumped all the other  events that day.  It just did.  Because everybody's  worst right there.  It's a little horrific,  obviously,  but the plane going down  is awful.  And there's no way to,  you know,  I'm not trying to  short sell it or anything,  but planes have crashed  in the past  with people on it.  With the circumstances  being what they were,  makes it worse  with the terrorists on board.  That's happened.  It's tragic,  but that's happened.  The Pentagon,  again, like I said,  it's still there.  You can still go  and see it.  And there's almost 
[01:40:30]  something about the Pentagon  that it is a military building.  And I think anyone  working there  has to know  that they're working  in a military complex  that is, you know,  primary target number one  for attack.  Yeah.  It's almost not expected,  but when you go to work  at the Pentagon  and you walk into that building  every morning,  you've got to think,  there are people that really  want to fuck this place up.  It's the basis  of the American military.  And being caught 
[01:41:00]  in the Pentagon  is not every person's  worst fear.  And it sounds crazy.  If you're dead,  you're dead.  But to be caught  under an inferno  in the trade center  and be forced to,  that's,  you find me one person  that can find  a worse fear than that.  It's everybody's  worst nightmare  on film.  Right.  And you're going  to work in the morning.  You're going  to an office building.  You're not going  to the Pentagon.  You know,  you're going  to an office building.  You certainly  didn't expect that.  And just the sheer  number of people  that died in the  trade center  makes it,  you know,  when people talk 
[01:41:30]  about it,  they talk about  the trade center.  And the sheer amount  of people that just  witnessed the whole thing  live,  not talking about  the TV version.  They were on the streets.  They were looking at it.  All the thousands  that ran from danger.  People that were  watching the people  jumping out of the  buildings for,  God,  who knows,  10,  20 minutes before  the towers actually fell.  I mean,  it's crazy.  There is not one  photograph or piece  of video,  to my knowledge,  of either the Pentagon  or the other plane.  No.  Which I actually  believe the other 
[01:42:00]  plane was shot down.  That's just my thing.  I don't disbelieve it.  Yeah, I do,  but for the right reasons.  I don't.  I know,  a lot of people don't.  Another conspiracy.  No, no, no.  I think it was something  they saw had to be done  and it was just  they wanted to let  the people be heroes.  Yeah.  I'm with Jimmy on that.  Anti-government.  I'm so with Jimmy on that.  I rumshaled at a weird  slip where he goes,  that plane that we shot down  in Pennsylvania?  Remember he said that weird?  Who said that?  Donald Rumsfeld.  He had a very weird slip.  Somebody out there  will remember it.  And I'm not some  conspiracy nut,  but that to me  would seem like a feasible thing. 
[01:42:30]  They saw where it was going.  They saw that,  you know,  whichever one of these  animals was flying it.  Uh-huh.  It just wouldn't surprise me  if it was.  That's all.  And they just probably  didn't want to say that  because, hey.  That would just be  an awful thing to say.  And there's no need for it.  No one in this country  wants to believe  that we would actually  shoot down  a passenger plane.  And we may not have.  Again,  it's just my belief.  I think...  And I don't fault them for it.  Yeah,  I think it just was  what they said it was.  I don't know.  Possible.  From all the evidence, 
[01:43:00]  it just seems like  the guys in the cockpit there  knew that  they were minutes away  from the passengers  getting into that cockpit  and just decided  to put this thing  in the ground.  You know?  That's possible.  I mean,  they didn't...  They were taking  one of the carts  and they were  smashing it  against the door.  They were ready  to get into that cockpit.  And a lot of the  recordings that came  out of that plane  show that.  I don't know.  Man,  those guys had a job  to do  and they knew  they were going  to die that day.  Okay?  Yeah.  The terrorists.  So, you know, 
[01:43:30]  you've got to think  they would have flown it  as far as they could have  to get a real target.  Maybe they did.  If they...  If the passengers  were just about ready  to get in there  and believe me,  it would have been...  Sir, could you please  vacate that seat?  If they got in there,  the thing would have been over.  The plane would have been  taken over  and it wouldn't have crashed.  Who the hell was going  to fly the plane  at that point?  They could talk you back.  They could talk you down.  And you're not thinking  that logically at all.  I don't know, man.  You could at least get it  somewhere where it's not  going to do any damage,  you know,  try to land it,  something. 
[01:44:00]  You know,  anything but having  two fucking animals  in the cockpit  trying to hit a building,  you know,  is better than  what happened.  And they could talk you down.  I mean,  they'd believe me,  as you know,  somebody probably could.  Whatever,  we're speculating on that.  And you might be right.  Who was on the plane?  Perhaps there was a pilot  in the plane.  It may not have happened that way.  It's just a thought I've had  that it wouldn't have surprised me  if they did shoot it down.  I've kind of thought  maybe they did,  especially if the rum shot  had that really weird slip.  Yeah.  Which, you know,  he said,  oh, that didn't mean anything.  Somebody might remember it.  I think the odds, though,  unless there was a pilot  on board of someone else 
[01:44:30]  landing a plane  after the pilots are gone.  It's not that hard to do.  It's all computerized, dude.  It's not that hard to do.  I don't know, man.  You're the guy in the cockpit, though.  You're freaking out.  Oh, yeah.  Even the most simple instructions,  you're shaking like a leaf,  going, what?  I'm going to land this fucking thing?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  You know what?  If you wrested out of the hands  of terrorists,  because they knew  that they were crashing planes,  that's why they attacked.  Yeah.  That's why you figured  that would probably  never happen again,  because as soon as they found  out what was going on, 
[01:45:00]  people jumped up.  Well, that's it now.  Everybody, you know,  the planes,  they've got to come up  with something else.  Haven't they killed  a few people on flights  who were just misbehaving?  Yeah.  Some guys missed me.  Fucking passengers, man.  One guy had a real bad,  he picked a bad flight.  It was a plane full  of, like, rugby players,  and he was mouthing off  doing something.  They sat on him  for the duration of the flight,  and when they got up  off of him,  he was dead.  Guy's just dead.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to take  any more chances.  That's why they're going to  have to come up  with something else,  because the plane thing  is really, 
[01:45:30]  as far as taking over a plane,  I'm sure planes can be  brought down,  but as far as,  you know,  a few guys very lightly armed  taking over an entire plane  with a few box cutters  or something,  that stuff's done.  That's over.  You're not going to sit there.  The biggest pussy in the world  is going to get up  and try to do something.  I think Eric found  what you were talking about.  Somebody would smash you  in the mouth  with a laptop and a bag.  You know what I mean?  There's so many things  to swing and a box cutter.  Quite a lot.  Yeah, a lot of weapons.  Yeah.  Here's the Rumsfeld quote. 
[01:46:00]  Remarks Rumsfeld referred to  the quote,  the people who attacked  the United States  and New York  shot down the plane  over Pennsylvania.  Hmm?  Was it a slip of the tongue?  Was it an error?  What was the quote?  In a speech,  Rumsfeld made  a passing reference  to United Flight 93,  which crashed in Pennsylvania,  after passengers attempted  to stop the hijackers.  But in his remarks,  Rumsfeld referred to 
[01:46:30]  the people who attacked  the United States  and New York,  comma,  shot down the plane  over Pennsylvania.  May have just been  a stupid mistake.  That does sound like  brought down,  shot down.  Yeah.  People are really  looking for stuff.  No, but when you hear  things like,  look,  all these Pentagon theorists  that say the plane  never hit the Pentagon.  That's bullshit.  You guys are all crazy.  And then you look at  some of the stuff  that they have,  why they think that,  it's like,  eh,  I still think  they're probably wrong,  but it's not crazy 
[01:47:00]  to think that.  But a lot of it  is just outright lies.  They say,  oh,  there was no plane  wreckage at the site.  And there's pictures  of plane wreckage  at the site.  There are,  at the Pentagon site.  Very small.  You know,  people are used  to these plane crash  videos that they see  or pictures that they see  of planes that maybe  were landing  or just after takeoff  a lot of planes crash.  That's,  you know,  when you get a lot  of plane crashes.  Low speed crashes  and you get a lot  of wreckage.  When you get a high  speed crash, 
[01:47:30]  that friggin' thing  disintegrates.  You're really not  going to get much  wreckage.  And that thing  was tooling.  My only thing is  when you look at  some of the photos  that they have  like right after,  like there are photos  like where you see  the fire people  on the lawn  and it's still  obviously a smoldering  wreck.  And they'll point  at all these weird  little things.  Like,  look at these  are windows  that are still here.  There's no wing.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying  that I can understand  why somebody would  find that.  Like,  I've actually looked  at it and went,  wow.  Because I was always  like,  you conspiracy  assholes,  fuck you.  And I looked at it  and I'm like,  well, 
[01:48:00]  even if they're wrong,  I can still see  why somebody  would at least  examine that.  What's their  reasoning behind  the conspiracy?  What did they  say happened?  Honestly,  I don't know.  I haven't cared  about it.  I know there's  conspiracy theorists,  but they're not  saying what the  conspiracy is or  what actually happened  on that day.  Two planes hit  the Trade Center.  We know that.  That isn't a lie.  We all saw the video.  So then what  happened at the  Pentagon?  Some guy planned  something and went,  oh shit,  they stole my  thunder in New York.  I planned on  having this fake 
[01:48:30]  plane hit a building  today.  Yeah,  I don't know.  And there were  plenty of witnesses  that saw the plane  coming.  I've also heard  witnesses that have  said that they saw it.  You would have thought  someone would have  came out and said,  you know what,  I never saw a plane  that day.  There were people  on the plane  that their family  went,  yeah,  he was on that  plane.  I've heard,  I've seen clips of  people who have  said that it was  a small plane  or it was a  private plane.  Whatever.  It was amazing.  It may mean  nothing.  I'm just telling  you,  I can see why  people would  speculate that.  But where did the  plane go?  The actual plane 
[01:49:00]  they have a record  of with the  passenger list.  Where did that  stop?  I've heard theories  where they were  empty remote  control planes,  then they took  one flight off,  and one flight was  just filled with  CIA agents under  assumed names,  landed them,  at a different  airport in Cuba,  and then had this  remote control plane  fly.  All this conspiracy  with absolutely no  reason for it behind it.  And that's the way  most of it is.  It's crap.  Yeah.  But the only thing is,  when you look at some  of the photos,  if you pull some up  during break,  you look at them and 
[01:49:30]  go,  well,  that probably,  that does kind of  look like a weird  picture.  Odd things happen  though sometimes.  You know,  you could have the  window that's broken,  and then windows,  a whole line of  windows that aren't  broken,  because you know  what?  That's just the  way it happened.  They shook,  they didn't break.  Sometimes it just  happens that way.  I was disturbed by  the fact that,  and again,  maybe somebody who  knows more than  me,  I'm not saying that  the plane did not  hit the Pentagon,  I'm just saying I  see why people,  because I saw some  photos,  and it does look like  a really weird  circular hole.  There are just  certain things about 
[01:50:00]  the pictures that I  look at,  and I go,  ugh,  that is kind of  odd.  Like a missile?  Yeah,  and I'd say it was  a missile.  Perhaps they were  shooting something,  a target,  another plane that  might have been coming  in that they  thought was coming  in,  and it inadvertently  hit the Pentagon  or something.  I honestly,  I don't have any  answers.  I have no theory  about it.  I don't know.  I'm telling you,  I looked at some  of the pictures,  and they were a  little interesting.  Kevin in Jersey.  Go ahead,  Kevin.  Hey,  I ran the D.C.  marathon,  actually the Marine  Corps marathon in  2001,  and we ran right  past the Pentagon,  and you could see  that something huge 
[01:50:30]  had hit it,  because it didn't  look like a missile  or anything.  It was something big,  because the way the  marathon course went,  you go right by it.  So it was real  easy to see.  Okay,  because I haven't  seen it in person.  I just looked at some  of the photographs,  and it does look like  the only thing that  bothered me the most  was the lack of  wing marks.  Like,  why?  Because when you saw  what it did in the  second building,  or even the first  building,  the fucking hole  it punched in.  They explained that  also,  because the structure  of the Pentagon  is different.  I was going to say,  there's a lot of 
[01:51:00]  brick work,  and it's not like  the World Trade Center,  which was,  you know,  metal,  thin metal,  that the wings  just ripped right  through it.  Lots of glass,  you know.  But why are there,  like,  I just didn't see  any marks with the  wing.  I'm just,  again,  I just...  The wings weren't  strong enough to  take that part of  the wall out.  Well,  they would have  shown some kind  of a damage  mark,  right?  Maybe there  are photos of it,  I just didn't see them.  Oh.  Maybe they went in  sideways.  A little dip action.  Yeah,  it's kind of hard  that close to the...  Dude,  they were,  like,  fucking,  what,  a few stories up.  Yeah,  that's really low.  That's hard to hit. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Very hard target to hit.  It's a very weird way  they struck the Pentagon.  So,  like,  instead of just coming  in the middle of it,  smashing,  you know,  they kind of hit  from the front.  That's,  you know,  just an odd...  Well,  then there's the theories  that they weren't  going for the Pentagon  initially.  They wanted to go  for the White House,  but the angle  they were coming in on  and they didn't know  how much time  they'd have left  before maybe  the fighters got to them  and it was a secondary  target,  the Pentagon.  Yeah,  I've heard that too.  So,  they were coming around  and said,  look,  there's a Pentagon,  let's go for that one.  Eric's showing me 
[01:52:00]  a shot that says  starboard wing  impact evidence.  Big concrete columns  with some big dents  taken out of them.  Yeah,  that does look like  a straight line,  kind of a linear dent.  Hmm.  Yeah,  that photo looks  pretty self-explanatory.  I think people  were expecting it  to look more like  the World Trade Center  hole,  where it looked like,  you know,  a silhouette of a plane  in a building.  Look up some  of the conspiracy ones, 
[01:52:30]  though,  just some of those  photos and just  see what they,  again...  Yeah,  people have sent  them on instant  feedback links  and stuff  to the conspiracy sites.  What's your,  what's your...  Everyone loves  a good conspiracy,  man.  Even if it's not,  I can see why  people would look at this  because I'm,  believe me,  I hated these 9-11  conspiracies.  What's your,  what's your biggest  memory of the towers  going down,  living in New York?  I actually lived in  Jersey when it happened  and I was awakened  by Florentine  after what had happened  so I was actually  walking outside  kind of in a weird,  weird shock  and then I came back  in and the second one 
[01:53:00]  had fallen.  I got two memories,  Anthony and I doing radio  and we couldn't get  into New York.  We were both living  on Long Island  at the time.  We had to,  we had a broadcast  from Garden City  at WLIR actually.  They were kind enough  to let us broadcast  and by the way  I've never listened  to the 9-11 shows  and I never will  and I love listening  to our old shows  and checking shit out.  I will never listen  to what we did  the days after 9-11.  No way.  But the two memories  I have,  one is the smell  of burning plastic  and flesh  that was in this city  for who knows 
[01:53:30]  at least a week  to ten days,  maybe even two weeks.  You can even smell it  out on Long Island  which for people  around the rest  of the country  I'm talking a good  30 miles away easily.  But the biggest memory  I have was  the following day  we did our show  from the New York studios  and then I camped  down in a hotel  because it was just  a nightmare  to commute anywhere  and I remember  Anthony and I  did this show,  one of these shows  that I hope  we never have to do again 
[01:54:00]  where it's just  a very serious show  talking to people  that lost their father.  I remember talking  to a kid that lost  his father in the Pentagon  and it was just,  ugh,  I'm getting chills  just thinking about it.  For weeks it was  hard to be funny.  It was a long time.  Oh yeah, yeah.  But I remember  doing the radio show  and just being exhausted  by all the emotion  I was feeling and stuff  and just going through  the process,  whatever,  and just going out  on the streets  of New York  to get a bite to eat.  You're not really  even thinking about living.  You're just like,  oh, get food  and hopefully sleep 
[01:54:30]  and somehow we'll get  through this.  Eventually, you know?  And I remember  looking around,  it was actually  right around here  like 56th and 7th Avenue  and I remember  just people  going about their lives  laughing and joking,  going to happy hour  and talking on their cell phones  like in a strange way  I felt like  I wanted to go up  to some of these people  and strangle them.  They were going  about their business  like nothing happened  and that's the thought  that I've never forgotten  because then there were  other people  and most of the people  obviously  where you could just  see it in their faces.  I mean for the first time 
[01:55:00]  New Yorkers were talking  to each other  and acknowledging each other  because like we said  with the Randy Johnson thing,  everyone in New York  has tunnel vision.  They just like look ahead  and they don't look at anybody  but after 9-11  everyone started talking  to each other  and it was a pretty  interesting time  to live through  but I remember  like these people  were just like  you know  going to happy hour  like going out  with their co-workers  and don't tell me  they were trying  to escape it.  You could just tell  that these people  were just not affected  whatsoever  by what happened.  Only a mere mile or two 
[01:55:30]  south of where they were  you know  going to eat and stuff  and I'll never forget that  because I thought  something like that  would just completely  affect everybody  and we'd walk around  like zombies  but there were a lot  of people  that just went  about their business  like oh whatever  I didn't know anybody  and ah  you know.  You could see  wing marks on this.  Okay.  Yeah there's definitely  wing marks.  They show the Pentagon  then they show  they superimpose  a scale image 
[01:56:00]  of the plane  you could see  right here  you see this  from here  to here  is the wings  wingspan.  I'm just showing  Jimmy a picture.  There to there  and here's where  it went in.  You could definitely  see wings hit here  but this building  is like a  you know  it's a brick shithouse.  But those structures  the little columns  aren't even invented  it doesn't  again I'm not saying  you're wrong  it's just hard to see  I just think  the conspiracy people  look and go  look there's no  wing marks  and meanwhile  you know  when it's looked  that closely  there absolutely are. 
[01:56:30]  I don't see  the wing marks.  I do.  I see the picture  of me but I don't  see the wing marks.  Alright.  Stupid conspiracy theorists.  Stop it.  Looking to make  something out of it.  Everyone loves  a good conspiracy.  Yeah most of them  are boobs.  One guy.  One guy shot Kennedy.  Stop it.  Come on now.  Lee Harvey Oswald  up in that building.  Now you're high.  That's it.  Now you're high.  That dog don't hunt. 
[01:57:00]  Now you're high.  One guy.  Alright we're  going to take a break  we'll step aside  and we'll get into  some other stuff.  Some funnier stuff.  Funnier.  Jesus.  How about some  funny stuff.  We should talk about  the drunk guy  and the fire extinguisher.  That's pretty good.  That's another tragedy.  Right there.  This could happen  to any one of us.  Yeah I'm sure.  We'll get into that  in just a few.  Like sand  through the hourglass  so is the ONA virus. 
[01:57:30]  Some of our fans  in Boston  have to send in  the audio  of the Bernie and Phil  commercial.  Hey Phil.  We used to love  those things.  Oh they dress up.  It's like a couple  of local people.  You have them in your city.  A couple of goofballs  that own a furniture store  that do their own commercials.  Yeah Jordan's.  They're always wacky.  Oh they're always wacky.  Why a furniture store  people have to be zany.  Hey we're just like  Disneyland.  Jordan's has a ride.  Yeah I've been there.  You're supposed to go there  on a Saturday night.  Instead of going out  on the town  to dinner 
[01:58:00]  you go to a fucking  furniture store.  Furniture store.  And they have like  a main street  built in their store  with like buildings  where it's like Disney  if you go into like  a Pirates of the Caribbean.  Without any of the fun  it's a fucking  furniture store.  You're still in  a furniture store.  Okay how many rides  and attractions  they put in.  Remember that guy  Light and Leisure  the purple building?  Oh no.  Oh no too far back?  Probably.  You know what  I'm going to still  plow through with this.  He's one of these guys  like he always  fucks up his inventory. 
[01:58:30]  And you know  he comes out  with a zany wig.  I don't believe  what I did this time.  I got 58 end tables  and I only got  room for two.  I'm selling them  for eight dollars each.  I don't know  what I'm doing.  Every fucking two weeks.  It's like  practically giving them away.  Yeah why don't you  fire yourself.  Maybe hire somebody else  to do your inventory.  Even the building  is purple.  It's crazy.  They're sticking out  against the fucking  background. 
[01:59:00]  Bernie and Phil  would always do sketches.  They would do like  sketches.  That was very good.  We used to love  Bernie and Phil.  I actually pulled it out.  The cowboy sketch.  Yeah they would dress  like cowboys.  Or the western sketch.  And the other one  was where Bernie  was on a shrink couch  and Phil  it's a guy and a girl  well husband wife team.  Husband wife team.  Phil is Phyllis  it's a woman.  So he was laying there  and he's a shrink  and he goes  I had a nightmare  Dr. Phil  What was it Bernie? 
[01:59:30]  I dreamt  our furniture  wasn't the lowest  price furniture  you could get  in Blasted.  Shut up.  We used to do  so many parodies  of that commercial.  They were a cartoon  too right?  Didn't they have a cartoon?  I never saw that one.  Oh that was  Building 19.  We just have  the worst stores.  Bernie and Phil  well we used to  goof on them.  Hey Phil  you know  hey Phil  your tits look like  this bean bag chair.  That is also on sale  in 1995. 
[02:00:00]  Hey I just bought  Bernie on your  new recliner sofa.  My sack hangs so low  I use it as an  ornament for this couch.  My cock looks like  an L shaped sofa.  Opie and Anthony  the virus  is spreading.  I  And we're back 
[02:00:30]  with the Opie and Anthony  program.  CNN's got some  amazing video  of the military jet crash.  Yeah they got like  I guess a  fighter plane  crashed in a  backyard.  They show the plane  kind of falling out  of the sky  or what have you  and then they  just cut to the  burning homes.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Why?  I don't know  was it the kid  that they showed  the guy  the kid that was  taking it  taking the video  that they're  interviewing?  Well we don't  have the audio  ups.  If someone knows  why they just  went from  the jet in the  sky obviously  out of control  and getting ready  to crash  and then they  cut to the  houses burning.  Does CNN  have some kind  of rule  if people  died in  these videos?  No one died.  They didn't die  in this crash?  No injuries.  I believe there  were no injuries.  It's a military jet.  I think the guy  probably ejected. 
[02:01:30]  I'm guessing.  Oh okay.  Punched out.  But if you watch  this at home  I guess they're  talking to some  kid.  It looks like  Martini Steve  at 15.  Yeah.  What a creepy  looks like.  A little creepy  cool.  What happened?  I was masturbating  and I saw a plane  falling.  I didn't stop.  I just kept  watching it.  Wow.  That thing  like crashed  between four  houses in  Arizona.  It looks like  they have the  rest of the  video where it  actually hits  the homes but  for some  reason they  haven't shown  it yet on  CNN.  It crashed 
[02:02:00]  with four  500 pound  bombs.  Perhaps they  weren't armed  because that  would have blown  up those houses  real good.  Ben's laughing  his ass off  now looking at  the 15 year  old Steve.  That was my  little observation.  That's hysterical.  With his little  starter beard.  He really does  look like that  creep.  And I saw the  plane falling  and I knew  there was  something to 
[02:02:30]  the best.  Goddamn.  One of our  pals is on the  line here.  Dom.  Good morning.  Good morning,  Dom.  What a fun  thing to  follow.  Well, we  just went  serious for  like an  hour.  We don't do  serious radio  but when we  do, man, we  really get into  it and now  we're trying to  move on back  into the funny  zone.  Well, you know,  you are the guys  that I go to  for hard-hitting  news.  All the time.  How you doing?  How are you, man?  We can hang  with the best of  them when we  have to, Dom.  I know that. 
[02:03:00]  You know, the  media likes to  just call us  shock jocks but  there's so much  more to this  program.  You're Bates  Cronkite.  That's what you  are.  Yes.  I was watching  this amateur  lesbian video.  I was thinking,  what do these  girls have to do  to turn pro?  They're so good.  I don't get it.  I mean, they  can't get a break.  That's a great  observation.  Amateur.  Yeah, you got  to hang out in  the minors for a  while hoping someone  notices you.  Some kind of  scout, right? 
[02:03:30]  I know.  There was one  other video called  Tongue to Ass and  I'm looking at  this and, you  know, real porn  chicks look at  these girls  going, that  ain't me.  Big hairy ass  in her face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not into that.  I hope I changed  the mood a little.  Yeah, just a  tad.  Definitely.  Hotter.  I'm coming in to  do Bananas.  In Hasbrook  Heights, New  Jersey.  Yeah, it's funny.  It's like, I love  the club, but, you  know, the name  kind of withdraws 
[02:04:00]  your dignity.  Yeah, how you  doing?  Yeah, I saw you  on that.  What are you doing  this week?  I'm on Bananas.  See you later, man.  Keep up the good  work.  And I love the  club.  I love the club.  I do that one, but  it's like the worst  backdrop is you're in  front of a black  stage with fucking  bananas hanging  behind you.  With the plastic  banana and that  chimp.  Yeah, there's a  chimp.  Are you kidding?  And the theme  song is the worst  theme song in comedy.  It's like, we have  no bananas.  Oh my God, yes.  Oh no.  It's an awful theme  song. 
[02:04:30]  I love the people  who own it, Harleen.  Harleen and  Arlene Jameson, they  were born old  Jews.  Eventually they  won't even have  words.  It'll just be,  eh, eh,  oi, shmeagel.  Why are you only  doing Saturday the  18th?  I'm doing a  corporate thing on  Friday.  Oh, look at you  with the corporate  gigs.  I'm too big to do  Fridays.  What company?  I don't know.  I just get taken  in a car like some  joke monkey and I  fucking do it for an  hour and that's it. 
[02:05:00]  You got to be  clean?  I hope not.  Do you like the  corporate gigs?  No.  No.  I don't like them  because, you know,  they didn't come to  see you.  You're at their  mercy, which I  hate, you know.  And then they  give you that shit.  Hey, mention the  boss's wife.  Right.  And then you don't  know whether you're  going to have  somebody crying or  laughing.  You know, they  say, you know,  work clean, but you  can be a little  blue.  What the fuck does  that mean?  Because their idea  of blue and a  comedian's idea of  blue are completely  different.  Right.  Yeah, I'm talking  about jizz shooting  over a hedge. 
[02:05:30]  And they mean, you  know, you say poop  or something.  And it is always an  awful thing they try  to tell you.  Like, all right,  Marjorie just found  out she has ovary  cancer.  Teaser a little  about it.  Yeah, right.  Teaser a little  bit about it.  Who's the uplifting  side of that?  The fact that I  said I'm 36 and I  didn't say ovarian,  cancer.  I said ovary  cancer.  Ovary cancer.  You know what,  though?  Like a dummy.  The line's so  strong, who cares?  That's right.  I didn't even pick  it up.  That's upright. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  When the line's  strong, it just  doesn't matter if  it's not grammatically  correct.  It works.  It works.  Are you doing the  Montreal Comedy  Festival again,  Dom?  No.  Are you guys  going up?  I went a couple  years in a row.  I loved it up there.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to  go up there, but I'm  not going to do the  festival.  I'm doing the  improv in West Palm  that week.  But my girlfriend's  from there.  Yeah.  So it's a good  chance to see her  away from my wife  and just relax.  Is this thing  going on alone?  I love that.  But it's fine. 
[02:06:30]  And how's  Brother Weez  doing, you know?  I check in with  him like once a  week, and so far  so good with the  cancer thing.  Speaking of  bringing the funny  back to the show.  I know.  We're not on the  air now, are we?  Well, Dom's a good  friend of Brother  Weez's as well, and  he went through a  brutal form of  cancer, man, I'll  tell you.  But he's so far so  good.  We'll see what  happens.  He's coming back to  New York in July for  a checkup.  Is he back on the  air at all?  Yes.  Yeah, he's back on  the air.  I mean, he wasn't  eating.  It was just awful.  I mean, he was  getting his radiation  here in New York.  I was seeing him  pretty much every day  or just about, 
[02:07:00]  anyway.  But he's a trooper,  I'll tell you.  He's a great guy.  He's great at  radio, too.  Yeah, I complain a  lot less after seeing  what he went through,  I've got to tell you.  Oh, I know.  But, yeah, he's  doing all right.  Yeah, it's hard to  talk about your  anxiety attack.  Right.  The guy's going  through that shit.  Oh, my God.  Radiation blasted  right through, right  on his head.  Right on his head,  basically.  Ground Zero was  like his nose.  I know.  Pretty much his nose  and that whole area,  you know, hitting the  back of the nasal, 
[02:07:30]  way deep in the nasal  is where the tumor was,  I guess.  It can operate.  Anthony's getting  all squeamish.  Hey, boy, I'm  getting hungry here.  I'm getting all  heebie-jeebies.  Anybody for some  oatmeal?  Yeah.  Hey, by the way,  congratulations.  L.A. Magazine  named you one of the  top funniest people  in Los Angeles.  I was in L.A.  a couple of days ago  reading the magazine.  And you were  certainly deserving.  Ellen was number one.  But the fact that  they had to put an 
[02:08:00]  equal number of  women and men.  Oh, they did?  It was all  women editors.  Of course.  Of course.  And I said,  well, and then they  told me there was  no particular order  to the top ten.  Because people,  you know how,  sometimes people  never are fucking  satisfied in life.  I go, you know,  I was number nine,  right?  So I don't give a shit.  I'm number nine.  I was 79,  100 greatest comedian.  Cedric the Entertainer  was ahead of me.  How much,  how seriously  can I take it?  I'm glad someone's  saying that. 
[02:08:30]  He sings,  he dances,  he has people over.  He entertains.  He does close-up  card tricks.  I don't get,  I don't get the  Cedric, man.  I like Barber Shop  or whatever the hell  that movie was,  but besides that,  I don't get the  entertainer.  I'm sorry.  You know what,  it's so much easier  for black guys  sometimes because  they can just do  the rhythm without  even jokes and get  away.  I was at the bus  stop,  they bus didn't  come.  Why'd I call it  a bus stop 
[02:09:00]  when the bus  ain't even stopping?  Shit,  what's up with that?  You know what I mean?  I mean,  it definitely is easier  because you drop  that rhythm.  Wanda Sykes is  terrific,  but you drop that  rhythm from her  and some of the  jokes are not as  strong,  you know?  I don't know,  Larry.  You know.  What do you think,  motherfucker?  I was talking about  that on stage  about deaf comedy,  Jim.  The guys are so  gross and violent  and they say,  God bless you  at the end. 
[02:09:30]  Baby,  that pussy was so  stinky,  it was stanky.  Stanky pussy.  Stanky,  stanky,  clustered,  mustered,  pussy.  Hey,  God bless y'all.  That was after  my grandmother.  Shout out to  grandma.  But what I was  going to say about  the other thing was  as soon as the  article comes out,  I'm pleased there's  an article,  you know?  What the fuck?  And a friend of  mine calls me up  and he goes,  you're funnier than  Kathy Griffin.  She beat you too?  Oh, boy.  But that's the  thing they looked  at.  Look at us.  We're not talking 
[02:10:00]  about how you  were in the top  ten.  We have to rag  on who beat  you.  Something negative.  But it's not in  any order.  Yeah.  I would do the  Tonight Show and  they'd go,  oh, that was a  great job,  but how come  Carson didn't ask  you for the  panel?  I figured,  what the fuck  do I got to  do to please  you?  Right.  You know?  And it figures  that a bunch of  broad editors,  just a bunch of  dumb women who  can't, like,  who are never  funny, can't  make a decision  on who's first.  Hey, guys,  everyone's the  winner.  They're just  such fucking  wishy-washy idiots.  I've never heard  Kathy Griffin 
[02:10:30]  ever be funny.  I like Kathy  Griffin.  I actually think  she's very funny.  Have you seen  her stand-up?  Mike Allen,  I'll admit it,  because on this  show, we don't  like female comics  in general.  You know,  every once in a  while we get  one that makes  us laugh.  Well, yeah,  the funniest ones  are usually the  lesbians.  Yeah.  One other thing  that cracked me  up about the  top hundred was,  listen, number  ninety-nine was  Janine Garofalo  and number one  hundred was  Gallagher. 
[02:11:00]  So how can you  take it seriously?  Like, talk about  a contrast.  One of them's  crushing  watermelons,  the other one  never got a  fucking laugh  in her life.  Wait, you see,  even the women  editors know that  Janine Garofalo  isn't funny,  but they threw  her a bone like,  all right,  we'll give her  ninety-nine.  Wait, didn't  she beat Dice?  Right above the guy  that smashes  watermelon.  Yeah, Andrew  was like ninety-four.  Yeah, she did beat  Dice or something.  Oh.  It's just sickening.  Oh, no, no,  he beat her.  He just beat her,  I think.  He might have  been number ninety-eight  or something.  Wait, and this 
[02:11:30]  is L.A. Comics?  Dice?  No, that was  Top 100.  No, Top 100,  Comedy Central.  Comedy Central.  Oh, that's right,  all right, all right.  We take comedy  and remove the edge.  Yeah, right.  But the thing about it  is they had like  ten Comedy Central  people on there  that were never  really that good,  you know?  It's like,  I mean,  it's why people  can't take it seriously.  I did the thing,  and I was one of the  hosts with Judy Gold,  Greg Giraldi,  and Mario Joyner,  right?  So none of them  were on the 100.  So they're pissed,  they're so pissed off, 
[02:12:00]  like once the cameras  go up,  and they root  against their type.  Like, Mario didn't  think any of the  black guys were funny,  Judy hated all the  women,  and Greg hated  all the guys  that were like  bright,  observational guys.  Can I ask you,  how did,  how did,  how did Kenison  get beaten out?  And I love Roseanne,  but how did she  get into the top 10  and Kenison was  number 20?  I mean,  first of all,  Roseanne and Kenison  weren't even close,  you know,  because I mean,  I'm old enough  to have worked  a lot with them,  and you gotta be  kidding me.  Roseanne,  she would say to me, 
[02:12:30]  hon,  you follow,  you go on after me,  I don't want to  follow you.  I go,  hey,  you got a TV show,  fuck you,  you follow me,  you know?  It's like,  but Sam was great.  Sam was,  I mean,  Sam's clean stuff  was some of his  funniest stuff,  you know?  But he,  I still used to  bless myself.  I wasn't ready  for some of the  sacrilegious shit,  you know what I mean?  You had to bless  yourself before going  up on the...  No,  no,  just when he'd be  saying certain things.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  it was amazing  how it affected me  psychologically,  because I never wanted  to be like a wuss 
[02:13:00]  about anything,  but like some of that  thing,  because I like to  hedge my bets,  you know,  with God and  everything.  I'm thinking,  I want to believe  just in case,  like an insurance  policy,  you know?  Right.  I don't want to  mess with him too much.  Yeah,  Sam was pretty  hardcore,  man,  with some of those  jokes.  Well,  he was a preacher.  Yeah.  He really,  he was riveting  on stage,  because...  He had a rhythm  that I just loved.  Yeah,  and I see these guys  ripping him off now,  like with the screaming  and all,  but it ain't the same,  you know,  because he did it.  That's what's so hard  about like doing  stand-up now. 
[02:13:30]  It's like,  you know,  the observations,  it better be about  yourself,  because if you start  going into certain  things,  you know,  if you're going to  do an airplane joke,  it better be brilliant.  Yeah.  Enough of the  airplane jokes.  Hey,  Dom,  being an L.A.  comic,  you've obviously  done the comedy  store many,  many times.  You think that  place is haunted?  I'm obsessed with  that whole story.  Really?  100% haunted.  And you don't  believe in ghosts,  do you?  No,  I'm scared  crapless of them.  I tend not to  believe in them, 
[02:14:00]  but I'm one of  those guys that  I don't believe  in them,  but please,  if they do exist,  don't come around  because you're  going to kill me.  I could feel it,  man.  The comedy store  is just such a  creepy place when  you go backstage  or whatever you  want to call it  in the kitchen area  and then that room  that has the  chandelier.  During my hiatus,  I spent a lot of  time out in L.A.  I was hanging out  with Dice a few  times just shooting  the shit in that  room with the  chandelier and I'm  not going to,  you know,  I didn't see  anything,  but you just get  creeped out when  you're in that  place.  Yeah, 
[02:14:30]  well,  no,  it's definitely  haunted and I  remember when I  first went there,  I hate being in  there alone,  like late at night.  Just to explain for  the rest of the  country,  Dom,  this place used  to be like...  It used to be  zeroes.  It was zeroes,  it was a nightclub  and there were  murders committed  there.  Oh,  there were  murders there.  Yeah,  and it was like  a lot of  gangsters hung  out there and  who's who of  Hollywood at the  time.  This is going  back to what,  the 30s and  the 40s or  something?  Well,  not only were  there murders  there,  but there was  also a guy who  when they were  on strike,  the comics were  on strike in  the late 70s,  and this is a  smart guy,  he jumped off the 
[02:15:00]  Hyatt trying to  hit the comedy  store with his  body.  Which everyone  knows it's  impossible.  Come on,  guy.  Yeah,  it's not an  easy jump.  We've stayed at  the Hyatt.  On the roof,  it looks like  you can make  it,  but you fall  a lot faster.  And I have  been on that  roof trying to  figure out the  physics of it  because it's  right next to  the comedy  store and  there's a  parking lot  in between  basically.  You can't  do that.  Get a nice  full roof  running start.  You know,  it's the saddest  thing,  I don't even  remember his  name.  This guy's  got to be  thinking if  he's in 
[02:15:30]  heaven or  hell,  what the  fuck do I  got to do  for people  to remember  my name?  More than  jump off the  Hyatt.  After the  strike,  apparently he  couldn't get  work or  Mitchie  wouldn't work  or something,  right?  Yeah,  that was it.  Did you know  this guy at  all personally?  No,  it was before  I went out  there.  I didn't go  out to L.A.  until like  85.  Yeah,  this guy just,  I mean,  it's creepy to  think.  How many  stories is that  Hyatt?  20.  At least 20,  right?  Yeah,  at least.  Hey,  Dom,  go back to  the comedy  store being  haunted before  we move on.  It's 100%  haunted. 
[02:16:00]  There's no  doubt in my  mind.  I felt things,  I felt like a  coldness in  there,  almost like a  cold breeze  with no windows  open or anything  and I just  keep walking  and I kind of  like just  say,  ooh,  you know,  like I'm  telling you,  you can almost  feel something  pulling at you.  I heard stories,  I mean,  I think I heard  a story when  Sam was on  and I guess he  was saying  something kind  of like evil  or demonic  and somebody  was like down  the basement  or something  and they heard 
[02:16:30]  like this,  you know,  whatever going,  he's here,  he's here,  he's here,  you know,  like that's  kind of creepy.  Yeah,  Kinnison and  Dice,  when they used  to get along,  they used to  like perform  seances and  try to go down  the basement  and do all  sorts,  yeah,  Dice told me  some pretty  interesting stories.  Yeah,  the basement's  not a fun place.  Yeah,  I don't remember  when,  and one time  like him and  him and Kinnison  I guess ran out  of the joint,  they were scared  could have been,  well Dice doesn't  do drugs but  it could have  been the drugs  Kinnison.  Yeah,  no,  I heard,  I mean,  I heard like  this Vietnam vet, 
[02:17:00]  this guy Blake Clark  and he wasn't  afraid of anything  and he got spooked  out.  He was like,  he was closing it  like,  you always hear  the story when  it's the guy  like putting the  chains on at  the end of the  night.  Yeah.  You know,  but I don't  even,  that must have  been long ago  when Dice and  Sam were there.  Oh,  a long time ago,  yeah,  because then they  became enemies  obviously but  that place in  general is just  front of your  face and then  you go to the  bathroom and it's  all black tile,  very shiny and  the lights are  very dim in there.  I went to the  bathroom once. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah,  Delbert Grady  came up to me  because I had  gotten some  avocado on my  jacket and me  and him were  talking for a  while and he  had some really  scary stories  about his wife  and two daughters.  He had some  good advice for  you,  didn't he?  Yeah,  yeah.  But I remember  walking up to  the urinal going,  don't even look  at the tile.  I remember,  you go through  this because you  heard the stories  and just look  straight ahead at  the urinal,  don't look at  these shiny  black tiles.  Because you'll  see things in  there.  You will.  Well,  it's definitely  got a bad  vibe in that  sense.  I do stand-up  in the original 
[02:18:00]  room a lot and  I know Joe  Rogan likes that  room,  but in the main  room I think is  where Ciro's was  more and that's  where I feel it  more,  like in the back  of the main  room.  Which one is  the main room?  The big room,  like the 400  seater,  400 or 500  seater.  I've been in  there once,  I've never  performed in there.  Do you feel it  in the back of  there,  like behind the  stage or  where the  audience is?  Yeah,  behind the  stage.  Behind the  stage is where  I really feel  it.  I don't know,  and supposedly  one of the  murders was  taking place  in a big  safe upstairs  at the time.  This is the  rumors I heard. 
[02:18:30]  It's so weird  because you see  these old  pictures like  Jerry Lewis  and Dean  Martin.  It was like  this real  nightclub in  the 50s,  I guess.  I don't know  how it became  the store,  but that was  a good move  by Sammy  Shore in  the divorce.  Sammy was  the owner  and he gave  this comedy  club to his  wife,  Mitzi,  and she  ends up  making millions  of dollars  out of it.  He was just  throwing it  away.  These are  Paulie's  parents.  I don't  know if  you've  heard of  Paulie Shore,  but I'm  not a  laugher.  You've  got to see 
[02:19:00]  this kid  perform.  He's so  original.  He's going  to be  somebody  someday.  Paulie said  to me one  time,  he had a  three-picture  deal,  and the  waitresses  were hugging  me and  stuff.  He  goes,  how come  the waitress  make a fuss  over you  and I  got a  three-picture  deal and  they didn't  even talk  to me?  I said,  yeah,  I don't  know,  Paulie.  I'm  thinking,  maybe because  I'm  fucking  nice to  them,  maybe because  I say  hello like a  normal human  being.  these guys 
[02:19:30]  because I've  seen so  much.  I shot  to the  middle and  I clung  there.  I've seen  guys come  up and  go down.  You know  what I  mean?  Paulie was  one of  them.  Remember  Ralph  Harris?  Yes.  Ralph  Harris was  one of  those guys.  He was,  hey,  I'm in  Philly,  you're my  man and  idol.  He gets  a series  and he  comes in  a laugh  factory and  he goes,  hey,  how you  doing,  man?  He just  blows by  me.  The series  got dropped  in about  six weeks 
[02:20:00]  and then  he comes  in the  laugh  factory.  Tom,  how you  doing?  I go,  hey,  how you  doing,  man?  You know  what I  mean?  Of course.  His brother  Ramon was  doing comedy  too.  Do you  know  Ramon?  Yeah,  yeah.  I worked  with him  at Rascals  or something.  Hey,  who else  was on  that top  ten list  in L.A.?  I know  Ellen  was number  one on  the cover  of the  magazine.  Well,  it wasn't  just  stand-up.  Larry David  was on  it and  the guys  who write  South Park.  Right.  Matt Trey.  Yeah,  and who else?  Zach Galifianakis?  No,  he wasn't  on the  top ten.  He was  like a  new guy  coming up  or something. 
[02:20:30]  Oh,  okay.  They had  like a  thing about  him.  But I  mean,  how can  you have  a list  like that  and you  not be  on it?  I mean,  it's  ridiculous.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh,  I don't  live in L.A.  though.  Yeah,  but,  well,  I mean,  that kind  of live  in L.A.  either.  I mean,  you're one  of the funniest  comedians  there.  I don't  get it.  Oh,  thank you.  Oh,  look at  that.  I'm serious.  Thank you.  I'm very rarely  out there.  I'm really  not on the  radar in L.A.  at all.  You know,  I'm not just  saying that  because what  are you  going to  get me,  the stress  factor? 
[02:21:00]  I know,  I'm going to  put it  in a word  with Vinny.  All right,  Dom,  anything else  on your mind  today?  No,  everything's  good.  I just woke  up real  early to  talk to  you guys.  I hope to  get into  the studio  next time.  Yeah,  that'd be  good.  I got so  much feedback  the last  time I was  on,  man.  It was  great.  Well,  our fans  are very,  very loyal,  my brother.  Dom,  let me plug  the gig  too,  man.  Dom is  one of the  funniest  comics  anywhere.  Bananas Comedy  Club,  it's in  Hasbrook Heights  in Jersey.  It's Saturday,  June 18th.  It's only  one night,  two shows,  8 and  1030.  I've got to 
[02:21:30]  tell you one  other thing.  70201-727-1090.  One night  only,  they will  sell out  June 18th.  I want to  tell you,  you know,  how you  kind of  start thinking  maybe you're  making it a  little.  I pull up  this,  because this  reminds me  of Bananas.  I pull up  to the  Lincoln Tunnel  and I give  the woman,  a beautiful  black woman  with dreadlocks,  I give her  the money  and she takes 
[02:22:00]  a beat  and she looks  at me,  she hands  it back  and she goes,  it's on me,  I saw you  at the Banana  Club,  you cracked  me up.  And I  thought,  wow,  I really  did make  it,  I'm getting  like the  free tunnel.  Wow,  she gave you  a free tunnel.  That's making  it.  Does anybody  else see the  irony in what  she looked  like and what  club she saw  in that?  Very nice.  All right,  Dom,  next time you  come in and  hang for the  whole morning,  that would be  great.  I look forward  to it.  Thanks. 
[02:22:30]  We'd love to  have you.  All right,  see you,  man.  There he goes,  Dom Marrera.  They're doing  a reality show  at the comedy  store,  right?  Are they?  Minding the  store.  It's going to  be Paulie  running the  comedy store  because I guess  he's running  it now.  His mom is  sick,  I think.  Yeah,  his mom is  sick,  so he's  running it  and he's  going to  bring cameras  in and now  you're going  to see comics  vying for  airtime on  that show.  I like to act  wacky around  cameras.  I always get  you airtime.  I like funny  faces.  Put your glasses  on upside down.  Use a banana  like a phone.  The laughs  that gets.  Of course. 
[02:23:00]  Mike in  Pennsylvania.  What's up,  Mike?  Hey,  what's up,  brothers?  Hey.  I love  Satchel.  Hi,  Mike.  Hey,  I just want  to tell you  that Unsolved  Mysteries has  this four-disc  DVD out  and one  of the  segments on  there is  about that  comedy place,  what was it,  L.A.?  Sure.  Yep.  Yeah,  and it's  pretty interesting  shit,  man.  You guys  ought to  check it  out.  I saw  that Unsolved  Mystery and  it was very  interesting.  Oh, 
[02:23:30]  and another  recommendation  just really  quick,  not to suck  the funny  out of  everything  again,  but Popular  Mechanics a  couple of  months ago  had this  debunking  9-11 edition  out and they  take like the  most popular  16 or 17  myths about  9-11 and  all the shit  that happened  and they  just go down  the list and  tear each of  them a new  one.  So I recommend  that to  everybody.  What was a  popular one  that they  took apart?  I'm sorry?  What was one  of the popular  ones that they  just debunked?  One of the  popular ones 
[02:24:00]  was a lot  of people  suggested that  there was  some sort  of a demolition  that took  place that  caused the  towers to  fall and a  lot of  people that  talk about  it cite  these little  puffs of  smoke that  you can see  when you're  watching the  video and  they just  go down the  list of  structurally what  would have  to have  occurred  scientifically  to make  these puffs  of smoke  come out and  it all makes  sense.  They talk  about the  bulge on  the bottom  of the  plane and  get this  shit.  Let's look  at,  okay,  you want  to talk  about  remote  control 
[02:24:30]  airplanes.  Well,  that's all  nice and  cute,  but you  know,  one of  the people  on those  planes  happens to  have been  Barbara  Olsen,  who was a  talking head  on Fox  News  Daily,  and she  also happens  to have  been the  wife of  Solicitor  General Theodore  Olsen.  I don't think  he just takes  someone like  that and  hurt her off  of the plane  after it's  been loaded.  You don't  have to  justify it.  It's  ridiculous.  It's  nuts.  So anyway,  Popular Mechanics,  a couple  months ago,  Art Bell had  this guy on  his show and  he interviewed 
[02:25:00]  him and  of course  this hack,  George Norrie,  he had all  of these  conspiracy  freaks on  several times  prior to this  and everyone  just applauded,  oh,  very good,  we hate  Bush and  so.  And then  Art Bell has  this guy on  and finally  brings a little  sense to the  conversation and  this guy's been  taking shit for it  ever since.  If I tell you  what,  these people  are vehement.  It's all  political.  It's shit,  man.  Ever since  Kennedy's been  killed,  nothing can be  anything other  than a conspiracy.  Try and think,  couldn't the  logical explanation  for something  ever possibly be, 
[02:25:30]  oh,  I don't know,  the correct one?  Many times it is.  You know what a  bigger outrage is?  The fact that  Sinbad beat out  Andrew Dice Clay  in the Comedy  Central 100  greatest stand-ups  of all time.  Yeah.  Sinbad was  number 78,  Andrew Dice Clay  95.  Dice might be  an asshole,  but, you know,  when that guy  was at his peak,  funny shit.  David Allen,  and Day the  Laugh of the Dice  is one of the  funniest albums  ever done.  David Allen Greer,  George Wallace  beat out Dice.  I mean, 
[02:26:00]  come on.  I mean,  not that they're  bad comedians,  but they're  better than Dice.  But stop.  And Sinbad has  a really high ass.  He blows.  All right,  thank you for that  info, Mike.  Bye, mister.  Some good reading  if you want to  pick up that  popular mechanics.  And number six,  Steve Martin.  I should ask Dom  about that.  I forgot.  I put an arrow  through his head.  Steve Martin.  When was the last  time he did stand-up?  In the 70s.  And a funny comedian.  He was funny,  but better than  Kinnison?  Number six on the list.  Kinnison's,  Hicks is 19,  Kinnison's 20,  Steve Martin is six. 
[02:26:30]  Well,  excuse me!  Look,  I'm laughing just  by you doing it.  You're Suda's wife,  you nut.  These lists are  always stupid.  No matter if it's  the hundred greatest  songs and all that,  the hundred greatest  movies,  it's always just so  political and dumb.  I will say that  one, two, three,  four, even five,  I don't know if  Chris Rock is number  five, I'd certainly  put him in the top  ten.  I wouldn't put him  at five.  Maybe not, but I  wouldn't put Woody  Allen at four.  I'd put Woody Allen  at three, actually. 
[02:27:00]  For stand-up?  As a stand-up,  he's the greatest  joke writer of the  20th century.  His stuff is  hilarious, but...  Bill Hicks should  have been in the  top ten, at least,  if not the, you  know, I think that  guy was great.  I love Roseanne.  I wouldn't have  put her in the  top ten, maybe  top twenty.  Eddie Murphy, I  would not have  put in the top  ten, maybe top  twenty.  Only because I  think that Eddie  was a good comic,  but a lot of his  stuff was kind of  prior, had done  very similar stuff  earlier, and again, 
[02:27:30]  Kinnison was just  so socially relevant,  I would have put  him ahead.  I'd have put  Jerry Seinfeld  where Chris Rock  is.  I thought Jerry  was really good.  Number five?  Oh, no, I  wouldn't have.  No?  You don't like  Jerry.  I do like Jerry.  No, you don't.  I think he's funny.  He really doesn't  like Jerry.  I could tell from  what you're saying.  If I thought he  stunk, I'd tell you  he stunk.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't  like Jerry.  I do like Jerry.  He tells us all  the time when the  mic's off.  That's a lie.  Tired of your  Jerry lies.  Have you noticed  I'm just trying to  fit everyone in the  top five?  You really are,  fucking goody  gumdrops.  Ten people I'm  shoving into five  slots.  Martin Lawrence, why  isn't he number  four? 
[02:28:00]  Runaway Bride has  been offered $500,000  for her life story.  Are you kidding?  $500,000 for her  life story.  What did she have  to pay for being a  kook?  Like $3,000 or  something?  Throwing rock at a  driver.  Oh.  Black youth.  That's surprising.  I love that.  Look.  It gets off and  then this throws a 
[02:28:30]  rock.  What the hell is  going on?  There you go.  Let the cops kick  his face in there.  Yeah, please.  I had a misunderstanding.  That's all.  But The Runaway Bride,  $500,000 for her  life story.  For what?  Can I ask why  Billy Connolly is  number 73 and  Dice is 94?  Who's Billy  Connolly?  Exactly.  He's a very funny  Scottish comedian.  Oh, okay.  Why is Eddie  Griffin 62 and  Dice is 90?  Why?  Oh, there's going  to be a movie  about The Runaway  Bride.  $500,000.  A movie about 
[02:29:00]  the...  Well, we knew  that was going  to happen.  Proving being a  kook in America  pays handsomely.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Runaway Bride  inks deal with  firm pitching  movie.  Officials who  search for her  aren't amused,  obviously.  Runaway Bride  Jennifer Wilbanks,  or Wilbang,  as we like to  call her,  made a deal with  a...  I know.  That's cute.  Made a deal with  a company that is  pitching a movie  about her life  to networks.  Annoying officials  who spent  thousands of  dollars searching  for her.  Regan Media,  a New York  multimedia company,  told the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution 
[02:29:30]  for a story in  Thursday's papers.  It has acquired  all media rights  to the life  stories of  Will Banks  and her  fiancé,  John Mason.  It's my  media company.  Hey,  is Brian  Regan on this  list at all?  Oh, yeah.  Top 100 comic?  If Brian Regan  isn't on the  list at all...  I bet you he's  not.  I bet you...  How the hell  do you not put  Brian Regan  on that list?  Doing a quick  scan of the  list.  I don't see  Brian Regan  anywhere.  Oh, my God.  A travesty. 
[02:30:00]  And where's  Rich Voss?  Okay.  Slow down.  David Cross,  of course,  is on there.  How bad does  Gallagher feel  that he's beat  out by Janine  Garofalo,  99 and 100?  I mean,  there's some  very good  comedians on  the list.  Mm-hmm.  Woody, I  certainly would  have put it  at number  three or four.  You guys  gotta listen  more to  Woody's stand-up.  It's genius.  Stop.  I got a  Victrola at  home?  No, dude,  it's stuff that  has not been  touched even to  this day.  It's genius.  Really?  Woody is a  fucking genius. 
[02:30:30]  I actually got  a couple of  Woody Allen CDs.  And the writing  of it, I will  say, and I'm  a prior freak.  Prior freak is  the greatest.  Yeah.  Woody Allen is  purely the  greatest joke  writer to ever  live.  Really?  Woody Allen is  the greatest  joke writer  to ever  live.  I'm gonna  have to  listen now.  It's fucking  poetry.  He's such a  Yeah, he's  purely a  brilliant writer.  Do I have to  get, like,  buy LPs?  No, he's  on a D.  It's called  Woody Allen  The Stand-Up  Years.  It's a great  CD.  I used to  listen to it when  I was 12 years  old.  My mom used  to bring me  home the  records.  Oh! 
[02:31:00]  Little Jimmy  enjoying Woody.  Under the  porch.  Yeah.  Listening to  Woody.  I shot a  moose once.  Blah, blah.  Hunting upstate  New York.  Hey, you can  almost do Woody  Allen.  Great Peter  Laurie.  I don't  enjoy it.  All right.  We're gonna  take a quick  break.  And maybe  play some  Woody Allen.  We should  play some  Woody Allen.  Hawk, bring  it up!  I wonder  what would  make sense  today.  Something quick  and short  maybe.  Let's see if  Paul could  find something.  In the meantime,  really fast,  after the show  today, Anthony  and I are  heading over  to RCS 
[02:31:30]  Store.  The RCS  Store here  in Manhattan  on, where  is that again  Ben?  56 in  Madison?  56 in  Madison.  Here it is.  Tons of  stuff to give  away.  Anyone who  signs up for  XM gets  Yankee or  Met tickets  and a free  roadie too  with the  purchase of  any XM  receiver.  And everyone  walking in  the door gets  a $20 gift  card.  That's pretty  cool.  Yeah, we  have some  celebrity guests  coming.  Who?  Eric's going  to be there.  Kenny?  Earl?  Earl's showing  up?  Yeah, that's  right.  Well, he's  trying to get  a job. 
[02:32:00]  He's miserable.  So, yeah,  Club Soda Kenny  will be there.  It's at the  RCS Experience  in New York  City at noon  today at  56 in  Madison.  Okay, we'll  be there.  Hawk found  one.  Signing and  taking pictures  and pretty much  doing whatever  you want us  to do.  All right.  Roy, did  you find some  Woody Allen?  This is one of  his most famous  bits.  It's not his  best bit.  How long is  this, though?  It's 18  minutes and  53 seconds.  No, it's not.  That's how they  were back then.  All right.  Well, this is a  Jim request. 
[02:32:30]  Jim Norton  requesting some  Woody Allen.  This is the  moose bit.  Yes.  I shot a  moose once.  I was hunting  upstate New York,  and I shot a  moose, and I  strap him onto  the fender of my  car, and I'm  driving home along  the West Side  Highway.  But what I  didn't realize  was that the  bullet did not  penetrate the  moose.  It just creased  his scalp, knocking  him unconscious.  And I'm driving  through the  Holland Tunnel, and  the moose woke  up.  So I'm driving  with a live 
[02:33:00]  moose on my  fender, and the  moose is  signaling for a  turn, you know.  And there's a  law in New York  State against  driving with a  conscious moose on  your fender Tuesdays,  Thursdays, and  Saturdays.  And I'm very  panicky, and  then it hits me.  Some friends of  mine are having a  costume party.  I'll go.  I'll take the  moose.  I'll ditch him at  the party.  It wouldn't be my  responsibility.  So I drive up to  the party, and I 
[02:33:30]  knock on the  door.  The moose is next  to me.  My host comes to  the door.  I say, hello.  You know the  Solomons.  I say, hello.  We end up.  The moose  mingles.  Did very well.  Scored.  Some guy was  trying to sell  him insurance for  an hour and a  half.  Twelve o'clock 
[02:34:00]  comes.  They give out  prizes for the  best costume of  the night.  First prize goes  to the  Berkowitzes.  A married  couple dressed  as a moose.  The moose comes  in second.  The moose is  furious.  He and the  Berkowitzes lock  antlers in the  living room.  They knock each  other unconscious.  Now I figure  here's my chance.  I grab the moose,  strap him to my  fender, and shoot 
[02:34:30]  back to the  woods.  But I got the  Berkowitzes.  I'm driving along  with two Jewish  people on my  fender.  There's a law  in New York  State.  Tuesdays,  Thursdays,  and especially  Saturday.  The following  morning, the  Berkowitzes wake  up in the woods  in a moose suit.  Mr. Berkowitz is 
[02:35:00]  shot, stumped,  and mounted  at the New York  Athletic Club.  And the joke  is on them  because it's  restricted.  Like sand  through the  hourglass,  so is the  ONA virus.  You know what  the worst show  is for those  clip shows?  It's Max X,  Maximum Exposure.  Because the guy  that they have  narrating it makes  everything sound  fun.  And here the  police officer gets 
[02:35:30]  two bullets in  the head.  Wow, that's  got to suck.  And we got it  on video.  Yeah, we got  it on tape on  Max X.  And thanks to  the video cam  and the car.  Here it is.  I bet this  cleared his  mind.  Like really bad  Arnold Schwarzenegger  lines.  This woman working  the deli counter  is having a bad  day.  A guy comes in  with a machete  and there goes  her head.  Gonna have a  hard time counting  the register now.  Like he's making  jokes and you're  like, oh my  God, the guy's 
[02:36:00]  dead.  This girl will  never walk home  alone again after  getting raped by  five Puerto Ricans.  And we got it  here on Max X.  On Max X.  Those spicks  brought a camera.  Isn't that  horrible?  We got the  video of them  stealing that from  a white guy.  It's the worst  show because the  guy sounds much  too happy and  enthusiastic about  some of these  clips.  It amounts to  Faces of Death  without the  somber music and 
[02:36:30]  monologue from  the guy.  What's probably  what happened?  Faces of Death  used to be  horrible.  It was like,  and then the  train hit the  woman as she  was crossing.  Da-na, da-na.  You know the  music and  everything?  The guy's  voice is so  crazy.  Fast forward  now.  Uh-oh, look  out, here  comes the  5-15.  He's all happy  about it.  Wow, yeah,  that train  caught her.  Last time she'll  check her  email before  work.  Last train  to dead  Phil. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, look  out.  Choo-choo.  Yeah, much  too happy.  That's what  happened when  they pitched  it.  They're like,  it's too dark  and you  can eject  a little  energy.  Yeah, can you  happy it up  a little bit?  They just  kept the  same coffee.  They just  had them  say it  happy.  Threw in a  couple of  awful jokes.  Limbs were  falling from  the sky when  the planes  collided.  Here's a  leg in the  backyard, no  thanks.  I'll have  a wing.  I'm  what?  A plane  crash.  What are you  fucking  fucking  you're 
[02:37:30]  insane.  Kirby and  Anthony,  the virus  is spreading.  All right.  One more hour 
[02:38:00]  of radio to do,  then we've got to  get ready for that  appearance.  Where are we  going?  Action-packed  day, Anthony.  We're going  to be at the  RCS Experience  in New York  City at noon,  56 in Madison.  Just get your  ass over there  and take away  free stuff.  Tons of stuff  to give away.  Did they  weigh it?  Did they  actually weigh  it and we  have tons of  stuff to give  away?  That's a good  question, Anthony.  My goodness.  How are we  getting it over  there?  And I hold  in my hand  what they're  giving everyone  that walks  through the door,  a $20 gift 
[02:38:30]  card.  $20 gift card?  Just for  showing up?  You know,  someone was  telling me about  this place.  Do you know  that they sell  a thousand  MiFis a month  at this one  location alone?  One location.  Wow.  Damn, that's  nice.  And there's  still people out  there that just  don't think this  satellite radio  thing is going  to take off.  It's not going  to take off.  Delusional people.  AM radio is  where it's at.  Where are my  oldies?  Delusional.  Do you see  in the newspaper  they're still  writing about  the whole thing 
[02:39:00]  of the oldies  station disappearing  here in New York?  Yeah.  And then Opie  finds an article  where there's  still five oldies  stations in New York?  No, well in the  New York area  there's at least  ten stations  where you can  get that oldies  music.  Yeah, where you  can still hear it.  You've got to go  on an AM or  a low power FM  or what have you.  But they're there.  But they're there.  And now the mayor  is getting involved.  He hates the Jack,  a new station  called Jack or whatever.  He hates it so much  that he's getting  involved.  Now the mayor,  the mayor is  getting involved.  And then Cousin  Brucie is doing  press now 
[02:39:30]  talking about  how he'll do a show  and he's going  to be playing  his own records.  He won't have  like a PD anymore  to push him around.  You can only wonder  what kind of gold  is going to come  out of that show.  You know what?  No one's going to  care in a couple  weeks, a couple  months let's say.  We don't worry  about it.  It's oldies.  Who cares?  There's nothing  exciting going on  there.  I was talking to  Ben before the  show today.  I talk about  the MiFi.  I should be the  spokesperson for the  MiFi.  I can't get enough  of the MiFi.  You love the MiFi.  I walk around  New York City  and what have you  and I go everywhere 
[02:40:00]  with my MiFi.  And what I do,  my new thing is  I'll pick a channel  that I want to  listen to,  whether it's the  70s or Ethel  or Squiz,  Lucy,  sometimes Fred,  if they play some  hits for me.  Jesus Christ.  I've got to talk  to that John guy  who's now running  the music channels.  They go a little  deep.  A little.  It stinks.  Fred stinks.  That station could  be great.  You're catering to  such a tiny niche  of people at that  station.  It's people that 
[02:40:30]  love New Wave  but love very deep  tracks from their  New Wave artists.  That's kind of niche.  It's stupid.  I want to hear a song  and go,  oh, I know this one.  I remember this.  Well, here's the deal  with satellite radio.  You want to go  flipping around  finding stuff that  you're just not going  to find on regular  radio.  Simple as that.  And in general,  there's not a lot of  stations playing the  80s New Wave.  No.  So if we had a  station, you know,  which it should be  Fred, where you go  there, you hear  Thomas Dolby blinded  by science because  no one's playing  that.  Instead, they play  like the fourth 
[02:41:00]  track off the  album.  Yeah.  I hate that  fucking channel.  I want the hits.  Because I get  rooked in every time  I go there.  I'm like, no, I  kind of grew up  with New Wave.  I want to check out  some New Wave.  And it stinks.  Well, maybe they'll  fix it now.  Now that you've  spoken up.  Yeah, right.  They don't listen  to half the shit  we say.  But what I do now  with my MiFi is I  just record a channel  all day or whatever,  five hours.  I've heard that the  MiFi could do up to  seven, but they're  not really advertising  that.  I'm not sure. 
[02:41:30]  But I've heard that  a few times.  And then let's say  five hours, I'll do  the Ethyl for five  hours.  Now you have five  hours of Ethyl on  your MiFi.  And then I pick and  choose out of all  those songs what I  want to hear because  it's all labeled nice  for you.  You know, Coldplay,  Speed of Sound or  whatever the hell the  new song is called.  White Stripes, Blue  Orchard.  And you see it, you  listen, then you see  one you don't want to  listen to and you  just skip it.  Go right past it.  It's sort of having,  you know, in a way,  an iPod with all your  songs on there and  decide which ones you  want to hear.  I can't get enough of 
[02:42:00]  the MiFi.  Only it's different  because you're loading  up brand new songs  every day.  Right.  You know, and then  you pick and choose  and the next day you  have a whole bunch of  new songs.  Then the next day I'll  go to Deep Tracks,  I'll record that for  five hours so I can  hear three songs I  like and know.  Right.  Another channel that  drives me nuts.  I get the name of the  channel is telling you  what's happening there  but come on, give me a  break.  And then do you realize  if you listen to what,  about 12 or 13 songs  that you've actually  paid for the cost of 
[02:42:30]  the satellite radio for  a month where you  would be downloading  from iTunes or  something at 99 cents a  song?  Well, speaking of which,  we should get Ben in  here because he has  discovered iTunes.  Oh, yeah.  He's downloading like  crazy.  What?  99 cents a pop, though.  I got the iTunes  software, whatever, so  when I'm, you know,  doing my music for my  iPod, but Ben has  taken it to the next  level where, yeah,  he's a subscriber and  he called me up just  freaking out last night.  You love your iTunes, 
[02:43:00]  huh?  The pay iTunes is  phenomenal.  I've been using that.  99 cents a tune.  You pop it into their  store, their iTunes  store.  You pop in a band or  a song in the search  engine, and it just  lists all of them.  You click on it.  You want to buy?  Yep, 99 cents.  It goes into your  library.  There you go.  It's amazing.  I was saying, I hope,  like, Peace Frog by the  door.  It's like, my CD  skips, so I went  out and got that,  you know?  But there's so much  shit you can find.  I was amazed at  some of the stuff I  found.  Hold on. 
[02:43:30]  Hold on.  I'm distracted.  I'm sorry I'm doing  this to you, Ben.  Go ahead, Keith.  Smash me.  Hey, what's going on,  guys?  I realize I said that,  too, but no one  else courted it.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Go ahead.  The new White Stripes  song is not called  Blue Orchard.  It's Blue Orchid.  Orchid, yeah.  Oh, is it?  It's a great song.  Yeah, it is a great  song.  Hey, is Jimmy with you  guys today?  Yeah.  Oh, I just lost him.  I didn't know he had  another question.  As he was saying the  question, I was already  clicking the mouse.  Go ahead, Ben. 
[02:44:00]  No, it's amazing.  Like, the Brooklyn Bridge,  the U2 show, there was  like four songs from  that on there.  It was just...  Live tracks from that?  Yeah, it was just like,  I was overwhelmed.  I bought like ten songs  and it takes two seconds.  There's a couple of  things, though, that you  can get.  There is.  I don't get it.  Metallica doesn't have  any songs.  Well, that would make  sense, but I tried  downloading like Radiohead  and there's no Radiohead  on it.  Really?  Isn't that weird?  That is weird.  There's certain bands  that don't want to be  associated with it for  some reason.  But you're paying for it,  you know?  You might as well put it 
[02:44:30]  up there if you get  99 cents a tune for it.  You know?  Because believe me, if I  want, I'll find the  Radiohead somewhere.  You might as well be  getting some money  because my first choice  was just the easy one,  go to iTunes.  And for the people that  think the music business  is dead, I mean, the  Coldplay CD, it sold  800,000 copies in its  first week.  They're still making  their cake.  Yeah, I remember  everybody was saying,  oh, once it's available  on the computer, it's  going to ruin the  industry.  You're never going to  be able to put out  records anymore.  The White Stripes,  their latest album, 
[02:45:00]  had the best opening  week in their career.  I think there were  like 500,000 or something.  You know what it is,  though?  There's so many people  that still want the CD  and the booklet.  I don't care what  anybody says.  I mean, there's certain  songs.  There was a couple  killer songs that I  got on iTunes.  I don't want to buy  the album.  You know what  happened?  I'm glad the whole  downloading thing  happened because it's  making the record  companies work harder.  They were just taking  advantage of the  consumer for so many  fucking years.  The only game in town.  And now they finally  had to get back into  their back offices and  stop taking three, 
[02:45:30]  four hour lunches and  getting drunk at  lunchtime.  And trying to figure  out what the hell  they're going to do.  And they brought a lot  more creativity back  into the process.  And now they've got  this new thing where  CDs are coming out  with the DVDs as  well.  You've heard that,  right?  So you've got the  album and then you've  got...  How does it work?  Actually, it's different  for every band, I guess.  But basically, you've got  a CD and a DVD now.  That's become really  common.  What is it called?  I was just reading  about it.  It's driving me nuts.  It's a whole new  thing they're doing.  Steve would know.  Of course. 
[02:46:00]  That and a lot of  CD-ROM stuff where  you pop it in your  computer and they have  some interactive stuff  on there.  You know, it's not  just music when you  buy it.  They have to give you  something else.  The point I'm trying  to make, though, it's  so obvious.  I was just thinking  about this this morning.  Regular radio,  commercial radio, is  going to have to just  cater to poor people.  Poor people.  And I mean real  poor people, not,  you know, guys that  are eking out a  living, but you  still have, you  know, money to spend  on your entertainment. 
[02:46:30]  You know, you do  have money to download  a few songs from  iTunes or what have  you or get your  satellite radio.  You're talking about  the impoverished that  are sitting there with  nothing but a little  transistor radio.  Yeah, because when I  do go back to  commercial radio, which  is so rare at this  point, I'm like, why  am I bothering?  Why do I have to sit  through a DJ babbling  about nothing?  Why do I have to  listen to the same  ten fucking songs over  and over again?  And then in between  those songs, promos and  long commercial stop  sets.  It doesn't even, it's,  when I listen now, it 
[02:47:00]  sounds so archaic.  Yep.  And the executives over  at radio stations, they're  so short-sighted with this  stuff, they can't see.  They're looking for one  thing to be their  demise and saying that  it'll never happen.  Like, satellite radio  isn't going to kill radio.  Radio's always going to be  here.  Well, no, it's not.  But they don't look at  the big picture, which is  everything.  iPods downloading from  the computers and  satellite radio.  Internet radio.  You throw all this stuff  in, and now you really  are chipping a big piece 
[02:47:30]  away from regular radio.  They just don't get it.  They're not looking at  all this technology and  how we're using it.  Every day.  I love downloading stuff  from iTunes, because you  don't have to buy, you  know, if you like a band,  you're going to go out and  buy their album.  Forget about it.  But if you like something,  you know, some classic  rock tune, you're not going  to go out and get the  whole album just for one  or two songs, and you  can just go there and  download, make your own  playlist.  Great.  Here's the deal.  Scott from New Jersey  helping me out today.  Go ahead, Scott.  Dual disc.  Yeah, dual disc. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  That's what Steve says.  The sign just went up.  Steve says, dual disc.  Yeah, explain dual disc,  Scott.  You've got a CD.  You've got your whole  album on one side of the  disc.  And then the artists  usually put together a  couple of videos for the  other side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, in a lot of cases, a  lot of videos, like a video  for every song in some  cases.  Yes, you're right.  Video for every song in  some cases.  Right.  And it's really easy to  use.  You pop it in on one side,  listen to the CD, then you  throw it in the DVD player, 
[02:48:30]  flip it over, and you get  to watch a video.  See what the record  companies had to do?  They had to start getting  creative again.  Absolutely.  And iTunes is awesome,  Anthony.  I've been a member for  about six months.  I have about four  thousand songs.  Everything you could  ever want.  That would cost you a lot  of money.  Yeah.  But I've been doing it  for a long time, and I've  got it.  So I'll constantly download  songs for them.  Who needs a subscription  to iTunes online when you  have Black Earl coming  over to your house once a  week with all the latest  releases?  Thank you, Earl. 
[02:49:00]  Yesterday.  Thank you, Earl.  You get the Earl.  It cost me a dinner, but I  don't even care, man.  Earl, you subscribe to  Earl Tunes?  Oh, my God.  He gave me the latest  Foo Fighters, White  Stripes, some live  Lucinda Williams, which  is interesting.  He gave me a Cold  Play.  This is only in the last  few weeks.  Yeah, I subscribe to  Earl, too.  No wonder he's getting  fired pilfering from  N.E.W.  Pilfering from the  station.  I don't get an actual.  I get the CD for about  five minutes.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Load it up and then  give it back to him?  Thank you, Earl.  Here you go.  Wow.  What do you want to eat  tonight?  You want a burrito?  You get a burrito.  Earl Tunes is great.  Earl Tunes rocks.  Why aren't I making  money off of this?  Go F yourself.  I'm sick of listening  to the record companies  bitch about their  losing money.  They killed us for so  many years, the prices  of CDs and all that.  Please, shut up.  The albums are  selling, though.  Every first week on  a lot of these albums  are big.  I mean, look at  Coldplay.  Was it $767,000?  Almost $800,000. 
[02:50:00]  That happens.  And then they put a  big thing on, like  Rolling Stone, the  resurgence of music.  It's back and  everything.  And then the second  they have a bad year,  oh, is this the  death knell for the  music industry?  And it usually, it's  just that in those  lean years, usually  it's because the  music stinks.  If the music's good  and there are bands  out there that are  really hitting, then  people are going to  buy the music.  That's the way it is.  They'll figure out  ways to make their  money.  They just have to  rethink things.  That's all.  That's all.  If you're a smart  person, that's what 
[02:50:30]  you do.  You rethink things.  I like the idea  of getting a copy  of the concert  that you go to.  That's a great idea  when you can leave  the concert and get  the concert on TV.  I haven't really.  What the hell is  that about?  They actually tested it  in Boston.  They're still kind of  testing it, but  basically, let's say,  how would you get  that many made in  such a short amount  of time?  They're doing it  mainly at clubs.  You can get, they  have these huge  burners.  They don't have it  figured out to that  point yet.  10,000 seats.  Well, no, it's not,  I mean, they're not,  they're doing it.  You're not getting 
[02:51:00]  huge bands.  They're doing it.  It's a lot of the  smaller bands, but it's  still pretty cool.  You can walk out.  It's pretty cool.  But you go see, well,  I was going to use  the Allman Brothers.  That's a bad example  then.  But you go see the  Allman Brothers.  You enjoy the show.  You really dig it.  And there's so many  times growing up you  go to a cool concert  and you go, man,  I would really like  that.  Say you're going to  see Great White in  Rhode Island or  something.  And you want to, no?  You couldn't get that  DVD?  Wow.  You know, actually,  they changed the  name.  Out of a police car  windshield.  It was actually, the  concept, when  Claire Channel came 
[02:51:30]  out with it, it was  called Burned Live.  And since when that  happened, Burned  Live, they changed  the name of it.  That's actually a  true story.  Oh, God damn, that  is bad.  And they changed  Great White, Burned  Live.  But they walk around,  you know, they walk  around the shows with  credit card machines,  so you can pre-buy it  and then you walk  out.  That doesn't sound  like a scam some  brother's going to be  working.  Yeah, you want to  buy this?  Yeah, just swipe your  card here.  Who's that guy?  I don't know.  Earl.  They're still working  out the bugs, but  there's obviously a  lot of money to be  made that way.  You see the show and  then you maybe wait 
[02:52:00]  20 minutes.  I mean, most people  wait that long just to  leave your seat because  it's such a mess to get  out of these venues.  And then on your way  out, there you go, you  pick up your copy of  the concert.  I say you hop in a  DeLorean, right?  And then you can get  a copy of the show  before you even see it.  Then you can see if  you're going to like it  and decide if you're  going to go or not.  That's what they're  working on now.  But there you have it.  Okay.  Moving on to other  things, Anthony.  I got to get to this  fun story.  Yeah, obviously.  This is something.  This was one of your 
[02:52:30]  favorites.  One of my favorites.  One that kind of  caught my eye and gave  me a chuckle.  A drunken engineer  yesterday pleaded  guilty to severely  injuring a pal by  shooting water from a  fire extinguisher hose  up his backside.  Brian Kennedy's  lawyer described the  assault as horseplay  that went wrong.  The victim eventually  needed surgery and had  to be fitted with a  colostomy bag.  Kennedy will be  sentenced later.  I guess these guys  were working away 
[02:53:00]  from home as a  refrigeration engineers  and the two men had  been boozing it up at  night in the city.  They returned to the  bed and breakfast they  were staying at.  The pair grabbed the  extinguisher and soaked  each other with it.  So up there, they work  together, they're drinking  a little bit, they get  home, find a fire  extinguisher, they just  start wetting each other  down a little bit.  I got to jump in here.  Yeah.  I remember you bringing  this story to everyone's  attention yesterday.  And we were talking  about like, you know,  when you're with your  pals, you're getting  drunk, you do stupid 
[02:53:30]  things when they pass out.  You might, some people  have taken their dick out  and you put it on your  friend's forehead, you take  the shot.  Never did that.  Personally, I've never  done that.  I could never even see  doing that.  All right.  Or you write dick on his  head.  That's what I used to do.  Or, yeah, whatever.  You draw a mustache on him.  All that dumb stuff.  But to actually go about  taking a fire extinguisher  and placing it up your  buddy's rectum.  Well, yeah.  It seems very gay to me.  A little bit, huh?  But now, I was with you, 
[02:54:00]  because I'm thinking it's  regular guys, until you  just read that line.  What?  That they returned to  the bed and breakfast  where they were staying.  They were staying in a  bed and breakfast.  Real men do not stay at  bed and breakfasts unless  they're with their chick.  Well, this seems to be,  they're working somewhere.  They were, like, working  away from home.  So, I guess, as  refrigeration engineers,  and I guess they needed a  place to stay close to the  job, and their job could 
[02:54:30]  have put them up in this  bed and breakfast.  The jury's still out.  I don't think they're two  gay guys, you know,  going wine tasting and  staying at bed and  breakfasts.  Well, refrigeration  engineers.  Yeah.  Not gay.  Bed and breakfast, gay.  So, I'm not sure where  this story's going yet.  All right.  I tend to think,  because they were  working as refrigeration  engineers, that the  company just put them up  at this bed and breakfast.  All right.  So, they grab the fire  extinguishers, start soaking  each other a little bit.  Ah, drunk off your ass.  Let me think.  If I would go that far 
[02:55:00]  with maybe a co-worker  or a friend, you're  drunk, you find one of  those big metallic fire  extinguishers, the water  ones, yeah, you might  turn around and go,  hey, asshole, poosh.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I'll give it to you a  little bit.  I still think.  I'm thinking a little  gay.  A little gay?  That's gay?  What, you look at, you  want your, see your buddy  in a wet t-shirt?  No, but it would be kind  of funny to just kind of,  you know, yo, turns around,  poosh, get him with the  fire extinguisher.  I'm sort of with you.  It's kind of funny. 
[02:55:30]  I'm a little suspicious,  but I'm with you.  I can see where that  could possibly happen.  Go ahead.  When you're now fighting  over it and soaking  each other with it in some  kind of impromptu wrestling  match, it's getting a  little gay.  Getting a little gay.  Yeah.  The victim then decided  to try to get some sleep.  So he had his fun.  They're drunk.  You have your fun.  Back in the bed of  breakfast, they squirt  each other a little bit,  whatever.  Time for bitty-bye.  All right.  But Kennedy attacked  him in his bed.  John Richardson,  prosecuting, told the 
[02:56:00]  sheriff, the complainer  was lying face down in  bed wearing some  boxer shorts.  So he's face down,  wearing the boxer  shorts, passed out.  He felt a hand on his  shoulder and the  covers being pulled  below his waist.  Here's where the story  just gets really gay.  All right.  Now, when you have to  start pulling covers  down and...  But, all right.  He felt a hand on his  shoulder and the  covers being pulled  below his waist.  This should have  never happened because  at that point you're  jumping out of bed  going, what the fuck 
[02:56:30]  are you doing?  At that point I'd be  going...  Jeep, jeep, jeep,  jeep, jeep, jeep,  jeep, jeep, jeep.  You want to fire a  signature up your head?  He felt...  He then felt an object  being placed near his  back passage.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why isn't the guy  moving yet?  Why isn't he moving?  Is that wasted?  Is he expecting  something else?  The hands on the  shoulders, the covers  being pulled back, an  object by his back  passage? 
[02:57:00]  Is he going, yes,  finally.  See, man.  Something a little  odd here.  Something a little  fishy.  I love this story to  begin with, but now,  I don't know.  There's a lot...  It's been a little  gay.  He might have been...  This might have  happened very quickly  and he's still drunk  and, you know, who  knows?  All right, can I  go to the phone  really fast, Anthony?  Yeah.  I got to take my  beating when it comes  my way.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hello.  I just got a  question, Opie.  If two guys playing  with a fire extinguisher 
[02:57:30]  is gay, picking up  marshmallows ain't?  I just wanted a drink  with the sorority girls.  I just wanted to go to  a keg party and fit in  with the rest of the  people at Geneseo  State University.  Is that so wrong?  Ed in Oklahoma.  Hi, guys.  I was just wondering  when's the part where  the Java log comes  into play?  All right.  Wow, he's reaching  back.  All right, all right.  I'm going to have to  tell that story for the  new listeners one of  these days.  Oh, yeah.  You just hold your 
[02:58:00]  breath waiting for me  to retell that one.  Quick.  Tell it.  I can't hold my  breath alone.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So where were we?  He then felt an object...  We were laying in bed  and...  He then felt an object  being placed near...  Near his back passage.  ...to his back passage.  Almost simultaneously,  he became aware of a loud  hissing noise,  which was the fire  extinguisher being a  discharge.  He was in immediate pain,  but didn't realize the  extent of his pain until  he got up to go to work  and realized he was 
[02:58:30]  bleeding.  God damn it!  Are you fucking with me?  All right.  Now, the guy does this to  him, and he doesn't get up  and do anything?  You know, he didn't  realize until the next  day he was bleeding?  Wouldn't you get up and  be like, oh, you  motherfucker, like, what?  He just kind of went  back to sleep?  Either this guy is  really, really drunk,  or there's some gay  thing going on.  But I think since  they're out drinking,  he's probably passed  out.  The victim was in agony.  He tried to stop the  bleeding with toilet  paper, but he had to  go to the hospital. 
[02:59:00]  So he's shoving  toilet paper up there.  Ow.  He had surgery for  severe damage.  to his rectum and  large intestine, and  doctors fitted a  colostomy bag.  The victim was forced  to give up work.  Doctors do not know if  he will ever fully  recover.  Kennedy, 34, turned  himself in to police.  He was fired from his  job as a result of the  assault.  His attorney is saying 
[02:59:30]  there was no  maliciousness.  It was just horseplay  went wrong.  Now, that's not  horseplay.  I've been drunk.  I've got to tell you.  I've been drunk a few  times.  Been drunk with my  pals.  Been drunk with my  pals, and we goofed off  doing things that would  probably be considered  horseplay.  Maybe be considered  rowdy.  Things like that.  You get in your car,  you hit a few garbage  pails, drive through  people's backyards,  knock down mailboxes, 
[03:00:00]  things like that.  Never, ever, has  putting anything near  my friend's assholes  ever come into play.  Ever!  The thought doesn't  even enter your mind.  No!  You don't look at a  fire extinguisher and  go, I'm drunk, he's  drunk, he's passed  out, let me shove it  up his ass and hit the  trigger.  You could think maybe  if he's asleep, and  that's the thing you  would do probably if  he's asleep, get the  fire extinguisher and  just, you know, wail him  in the face with it.  That's funny stuff. 
[03:00:30]  The ass does not,  if you're heterosexual,  the ass never comes  into play.  Those football players  that got in trouble  for the hazing with  the younger football  players, the pine  cones, they thought,  they saw pine cones  and thought, let's  shove these pine cones  up the young boys'  asses.  And who went, yeah,  that's a great idea,  and not, dude, what  are you, what are you,  gay?  Not one guy standing  up for everyone else  saying, what are you, 
[03:01:00]  gay?  No.  Instead, they decided  to be followers?  Aren't there a thousand  other things you can  think of during a  hazing that does not  involve another man's  asshole?  Whoa.  Well, I guess I  voluntarily picked up  that marshmallow and  dropped it on what was  supposed to be the  rival's frat house.  You should have  spoke up.  You should have  said, guys, why are we  doing this?  Can you not think of a 
[03:01:30]  thousand other things  that did not involve our  asses?  Right.  Good point, Anthony,  good point.  You must have really  wanted to be in that  fraternity, man.  Being out of a  fraternity was that  bad?  Wow.  It's like another life,  Anthony.  What is the life of the  guy that isn't in a  fraternity at Geneseo?  Is it lonely?  Yeah, it's not a good  life.  Are you not getting  chicks?  Back in the day, if you  weren't in a fraternity or  sorority at my college,  you might as well not even  go out.  You're nobody. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, because, you know,  everyone's obviously.  Fraternity guys are  getting older.  In college, it's so  superficial.  It was all about, oh,  you're a SIGEP.  You're a FI SIG.  Wow.  You're cool.  Right.  You're a sticky ass.  No, I'm cool because I'm  me.  It wasn't about that.  Yeah.  You had to be part of a  fraternity to get the  chicks, be cool.  Honestly, thinking back.  And if that involves me  squatting over a  marshmallow, picking it  up with my butt, and  dropping it on a fake  fraternity's house. 
[03:02:30]  I love that.  That would have to be  like a bombing run.  Hey, you know, we  confess some things on  this show.  Okay, Todd.  Certainly do.  You know, looking back  at that, though, I can't  even imagine I ever did  that.  I swear, it's like  looking at another life.  Neither can we.  It's like looking at  another life.  Like, I already lived  this other life or  something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it should never  involve another man's  ass.  That's all I'm trying to  say.  All right, well, we got a  ton of calls coming in.  Let's go to Brian. 
[03:03:00]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, man.  All right.  Hey, you know what  happened with them two  guys is that guy was so  drunk and passed out.  The other one thought,  hey, well, might as well.  He took advantage of  him, tore him up so bad  he used the fire extinguisher,  so douche him out.  Douche him out.  Can you imagine?  Thank you.  Let's go to Kansas.  John, what's up?  Yeah, hey, did that  article say whether or not  the said victim was  pushing back?  Yeah, because it's not  gay unless you push back.  It's not gay unless you 
[03:03:30]  push back.  We have learned that on  this program, so thank  you for that, John.  Let's go to Pennsylvania  and Sean.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, they had to have  been gay.  I mean, don't they have  their own rooms?  What's this guy doing  in the other guy's room?  Bed and breakfast.  Bed and breakfast.  I think you only get  like one room, maybe two  beds.  Bed and breakfasts are  owned by either gay guys  or swingers.  Is that it?  I've gotten dragged by  my wife at the bed and  breakfast.  I went to a bed and  breakfast with an ex in  Hyannis.  Hyannis. 
[03:04:00]  Hyannis?  Hyannis, it might as well  have been called.  Yeah.  This guy that ran the  place was such a  strange creep.  Was he flaming?  Yeah, and he was just  I think he was just  hoping for action.  Yeah.  Nice.  And then you gotta like  eat breakfast with  other couples.  That's why, you know.  Like Jersey and stuff  and you're like, I  don't care about your  life.  I'm with my chick.  I just want to bang  all weekend.  Leave me alone.  Never will you catch  me in a bed and  breakfast.  You're not gonna catch  me for the free wine  at four o'clock in the  afternoon.  You gotta walk down 
[03:04:30]  stairs.  So you have a little  social in the stupid  living room.  And socialize with the  other people staying  there, eat with them,  eat at the table, and  it's some woman cooking  in her kitchen, right?  Is that what it was?  Yeah, they cook for you.  They leave little snacks  out and then there's a  wine hour.  Oh, that just sounds  like something I do not  want to be part of.  Do you share a bathroom?  No.  Is there like a bathroom  out in the hallway?  I'm sure some of the  places, but no.  Yeah?  This had your own  bathroom?  I believe so. 
[03:05:00]  It's a long time ago  now.  Was there a TV in the  room?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Cable?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  I stayed at some  place.  It was upstate New York  where it was just this  nightmare, haunted-looking  old mansion thing.  And I couldn't sleep.  I was scared shitless.  Again, I'm such a pussy.  I was looking at the...  They had like some  border up on the wall.  You know how they  paint the wall and  they put a border up by  the ceiling and it  looked like in the dark  things were moving on  it. 
[03:05:30]  And, you know, it's your  imagination and lighting.  But no TV in the room.  Like, I need a TV,  especially if I'm away  somewhere in a hotel  or something that's  creepy, I need a TV on.  Kind of brings you into  the now.  Takes you out of the  fact that you're in an  ancient, like, a  haunted-looking mansion  thing when you're  watching Fox News.  You know?  How can anything around  be scary when Fox News  is on?  That's the scariest  thing ever.  I want someone to  explain out there why  you bring up a good  point.  When I'm in, like,  old hotels or old  houses in general, I  get that feeling.  Not in all old hotels 
[03:06:00]  or old houses.  Yeah.  So my logic is like,  wow, this place is  haunted.  I'm feeling some kind  of energy.  Yeah.  Only feel it in old  places.  Is it because it looks  old and unfamiliar?  It's the history.  You got it.  And also, you have to  assume if a place is  old, and I'm talking  like, you know, early  1900s kind of place  with those big crystal  doorknobs and the old  keyholes that you can  look through.  And the ceilings  are way too creepy  because they're like  17 feet high.  Big high ceilings,  big old windows with  the wavy glass panes 
[03:06:30]  and stuff.  That old grandma  curtain.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  It's got that old  smell.  Because you can  assume in all those  years, someone probably  has died in there.  At least one person  has died in that  building.  So that gives you,  like, the heebie-jeebies.  Just the history of it,  things that have gone  on in there.  People that have  lived there that maybe  if they didn't drop  dead in the place,  they're dead now and  might want to give it  a little visit during  their eternity.  Because they're  feeling sentimental.  Yeah.  I remember, I had a 
[03:07:00]  great time here.  I had a wonderful  time in the same room  you're in.  Ooh.  Ah, get away.  I'd enjoy myself.  All right, let's, uh.  Just creepy.  Let's go to the phones.  They've exploded.  Sean in Boston,  what's up?  Hey, what's up,  ba-ba-ba-ba-boy?  Hey, Sean.  I'm calling because  when I was a young lad  in the Boy Scouts,  an old hazing trick  would be to blindfold  one of the younger kids 
[03:07:30]  and to initiate them,  so to speak,  all you'd have to do  is have them do  is sit up blindfolded.  Now, some people  would fall for it  and other people  would kind of  be savvy to it.  You'd have another  person hovering over them  with their asshole exposed,  so when they do a sit up,  their nose enters  the other person's asshole.  See, I can't defend, uh.  Ugh.  It's awful,  and it's very gay.  I mean, it never happened.  It's as much like  I attacked the ringleader  of the group, 
[03:08:00]  so they kind of accepted me.  Hey, and you know what?  I'm not alone, man.  There's a lot of guys  out there that have  pledged fraternities  and, uh, God,  the military,  and they have these  weird gay hazing things.  Yeah.  I'm not the only one.  Make all the fun you want,  but you're sitting there  in your car right now  going, oh, God,  if anyone knew  what I did to join,  uh, you know,  the Weeblos.  Weeblos.  I never understood  that name.  Yeah, not at all.  David in Ohio,  what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going? 
[03:08:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Uh, Jimmy.  Hello.  Oh, Jimmy left?  Jimmy had to catch  a flight to, uh,  Dallas.  He's going to be  at the, uh,  Addison Improv  all weekend long.  I was going to say  hi to Liddy, too.  I guess he took him  with him.  Oh, well.  And if you're on,  and if you're in Dallas,  uh, Jimmy will be on  the Pugs and Kelly show,  uh, tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  And, and someone  better call in,  so, oh, no,  I guess, ah,  we might overlap an hour,  so we can have fun  listening to Jimmy tomorrow.  All right, go ahead, David.  Yeah, I got a story to tell.  When I was about 14, 
[03:09:00]  um, I was over swimming  at a, at a friend's house,  uh,  same as Danny,  but anyway, uh,  you scared me  and you said,  hey, I bet you can't  swim from one end  of the pool to the other  underwater holding  your breath the whole time.  And I said,  I sure can.  So I held my breath  at one end  and swam all the way  underwater to the other  and when I came up  gasping for air  at the other end,  his open bare a-hole  was waiting for me  and my face  just went right into it 
[03:09:30]  and just lopped  and lopped  and lopped.  Because he can watch you  coming, uh,  towards him underwater.  All right.  Knowing where you're  going to pop up.  Here's the game  we're going to play.  You guys tell us  these weird gay hazing stories  and Anthony and I  will either tell you  it's gay or just funny.  Gay or hysterically funny.  I gotta say that's just funny  because the first thing  you want to do  when you get out of  swimming the length  of the pool underwater  is take a deep breath  and you're gasping for air  and you're gasping 
[03:10:00]  from the horror  of what is in your face.  I'm going to go with  plain funny on that story.  You're going funny?  Yes.  Is there any other category  funny with homo overtones?  Wow, that is funny.  David, that's really funny.  I'm going to go with  just plain funny, Anthony.  That's funny.  Sean in Alabama,  what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I actually got two stories.  One fucked up.  One might be gay,  might be a little bit funny.  All right.  Pleasant fraternity  down at the University of Alabama. 
[03:10:30]  We'd have to do a thing  called bows and toes  and what it was  was we got in trouble.  We'd have to get down  to the basement,  lie down on our stomachs  and we'd have to lift  ourselves up  with our toes  and our elbows.  That was it.  Well, it gets fucked up  when we'd have to lift up  our elbows  and they'd put bottle caps  under them.  So we're sitting down there  picking ourselves up  sitting on bottle caps  and we'd have to be there  four or five minutes  and they'd have a thing  called direct TV  where we'd have to lift  one elbow up  and all our weights  on our elbow  on a bottle cap. 
[03:11:00]  That's it.  That's not gay or funny, sir.  The other one is  there's another fraternity  down in Alabama.  It's the Deeks.  And right around Hell Week  they would have a goat  tied to the front of the house.  And there's a story  going around  they'd have to  they tell their pledges  you have to fuck a goat  to get in the fraternity.  If they say,  okay,  well,  fuck the goat  they get blackballed  and thrown out.  But for the one week  they'd have a black goat  sitting in the front yard.  Oh my God.  All right, Sean.  Thank you. 
[03:11:30]  Thanks, bro.  All right,  let's go to Spike in Chicago.  Spike, what's up?  Yeah, man.  The story about these guys  on bed and breakfast  kind of makes you wonder  how many hands the guy has.  Yeah, right.  He's got one hand  on the guy's shoulder.  He's pulling down the covers  and then you've got  the other one  and then he's putting  the fire extinguisher  up his ass  and then he's actually  pulling the fire extinguisher.  Yeah, everyone knows  you work on a fire extinguisher  with two hands.  Two hands.  Right.  Good point, Spike.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, let's go  to Gary in Indianapolis.  Gary.  Hey, guys. 
[03:12:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Back in the college days  in the early 90s,  we went and bought  about six dozen donuts,  just the regular glazed donuts.  And we made all  of our pledges  come in one night  and we took a dozen  of those donuts  and made them stick them  on their dicks  and we took Polaroids of them.  We made a sorority  take the rest of the fresh donuts  over to another fraternity  and they gobbled them up.  Then the next day  we throw all the Polaroids  over into their house.  Why would anyone  eat donuts  that were brought 
[03:12:30]  from another...  But they didn't know.  See, that's the gag.  Yeah?  The pledges got the donuts  on...  See, I know this fraternity stuff.  I didn't do this one,  by the way.  Oh, no.  You did?  I did not.  Jesus Christ.  I've done enough stupid shit.  I don't need you guys  piling more crap on.  So the donuts  are on the pledges' penises, right?  Yes.  And you take all the pictures  and then you have a sorority  take the donuts.  You know,  you put them right back in the box.  Uh-huh.  The cute sorority girls  with their little half shirts  and stuff, 
[03:13:00]  you know,  bring them over  to another fraternity house.  Oh, I got you.  And of course,  they're having a little social  and the guys are going  to eat the donuts.  Like, oh, look,  the girls are giving us donuts  and they eat them up  and then the fraternity  throws the Polaroids  all over their lawn  and their house and stuff  going,  look what you guys just ate.  That is grim.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Gary.  Thanks.  Let's go to John.  That's why I don't eat  any donuts  that listeners bring us.  I'm very afraid  that the next day  some pictures might show up  in an email.  I don't eat anything  the listeners bring.  Don't bring me anything,  okay, people? 
[03:13:30]  Kenny won't let us  eat anything anyway.  No.  Thank God he's here.  Won't let us drink anything.  People bring me an open beer.  Kenny goes,  nope,  takes it away from me.  Never, ever, ever  lets me drink or eat anything.  Nothing but the best  for you fellas.  Thank you, Kenny.  Jesus, your voice  sounds very weak today.  So good to see you today.  Well, you know,  I'm just very relaxed here  watching you guys work.  Yeah?  Are you amazed by our talent?  I'll tell you,  it is so overwhelming.  I'm just taking it back. 
[03:14:00]  Do you have laryngitis  or something?  No, I'm just like,  you know, I'm mellow.  This is like a laid back Kenny.  I'm not used to it.  I'm used to it.  Hello.  It's Kenny.  Hi, handsome.  It's Kenny Cool.  Kenny Cool?  You remember that?  Yeah.  It's Dice Cool.  It's Dice Light.  Dice Light.  Wasn't it?  They called themselves Dice Cool.  All right, listen,  Kenny's here  because right after the show,  we're going to be at  RCS Experience in New York City,  56 in Madison at noon,  giving away tons of stuff, Anthony. 
[03:14:30]  Tons and tons.  Including tickets to see  the Yankees and the Mets.  And right off the bat,  you walk in,  you get a $20 gift card.  That's right.  And a free roadie, too,  with the purchase of  any XM receiver today.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  And we've got a lot of XM stuff  to give away,  and that's why Kenny  is doing the hang right now.  Besides that $20 gift card,  just the chance that people  have an opportunity  to come see greatness  would make everybody's Thursday.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, Kenny,  we're going to move back  to do our radio show. 
[03:15:00]  Jason and me, what's up?  You're not happy  unless you're talking  about gay stuff.  Go ahead, Jason.  Are you guys familiar  with the Atomic Sit-Up?  No.  Atomic Sit-Up.  Yeah, it's an old  private school gag  on the hockey team.  They guarantee the freshmen  that they can't do a sit-up  with a towel over their head,  their feet on the bench,  and touch their elbows to them.  Oh, this is a...  Isn't this a Marine thing, too?  It may be.  It got pulled on me  in private school.  Worst embarrassing moment  as a freshman 13 years old 
[03:15:30]  could ever go through.  All right, listen to this one,  Anthony.  Go ahead.  And as you're going  to do the sit-up,  one of the senior guys  stands over the top of you  and they pray for the towel  on your face.  And as you're doing the sit-up,  they whip the towel off,  and the next thing you know,  your face is buried  in the guy's ass cheeks  in front of you.  See, there's no reason for that.  Yeah, but as a freshman,  you're just trying to be cool  for those important seniors.  All right.  No reason.  Hey, Anthony,  you want to learn  what the elephant walk  is all about? 
[03:16:00]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I had a buddy  who went to a university  in Indiana,  and for their frat,  they did the elephant walk.  Basically, you got  one thumb in your mouth  and one in the pledges  ass in front of you.  and like every couple  minutes or so,  you got to switch hands.  Oh, God.  Why would you stop it?  That does not really happen.  Swear to God, dude.  That does not really happen.  Swear to God.  Where do you find guys  that would do this?  I don't know.  This is not happening. 
[03:16:30]  No one would shove  their thumb up  another guy's ass  and then allow  another man  to shove his thumb  up your ass  as you go around  and then pull it out  and put it in your mouth?  I want to go on record  to say, Anthony,  I never had to do  the elephant walk.  Oh, thank God.  As well.  I don't think you ever  recover from that.  You can't recover from that.  You have that mind control.  What?  You get a little crazy.  Your eyes have that.  There is not a thumb  in your ass.  You are not putting  that thumb that was  in a man's ass  in your mouth.  All right, boy.  Punch it out.  All right. 
[03:17:00]  The elephant walk.  Mind control?  Yeah, you get all...  That's like a rape.  You don't just go home  from that.  You become like Patty Hearst.  All of a sudden,  it's just like,  what?  Where am I?  You're fine with it?  I'm robbing a bank?  What?  What happened?  What happened now?  No.  Martini Steven Studio.  What's up, Steve?  How are you?  Good.  Oh, is that the new jingle  you have in your hand?  Well, we could...  Yeah, we're screening calls  because the phones  have exploded  with more gay hazing stories.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And we kind of want  the stories where we decide  if it's gay  or just plain funny,  like that pool story. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  But you got a jingle?  Yes.  Nathaniel and I sat in  and made a jingle  in response to some  of the other jingles  that were coming in.  Oh, you mean you guys  made this?  We made this.  All right.  This is a jingle.  Very excited.  Anthony, Steve and the gang,  they're like rappers.  Uh-huh.  This is how they respond  to the listeners  with their own...  With their music, man.  Their own prose...  Prose...  Prose...  SIS.  Prose...  What's the poem word?  Prose...  P-R-O... 
[03:18:00]  Their own...  Prose...  I can't wait to hear it.  What's wrong, Steve?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing.  What?  I just...  Nothing.  What?  Huh?  There's something going on.  Nothing.  Eric just went over  and...  Eric completely distracted me.  Yeah, that'll happen.  All right, well, here's...  Every ding-dong day.  Here's the jingle  from Steve and Nathaniel.  We need to remember  that we are professionals  in the entertainment industry.  You know,  the funny thing is, too...  Ah!  Here comes the world's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle. 
[03:18:30]  I'll show the world  I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects  and a few lines  that don't make no sense  and open it  will be so proud of me.  Thank...  Epic...  God...  I've missed the point completely  I should kill myself discreetly  This jingle  is the best of my skills  I know  My life's been kind of rough  and 18 years is long enough 
[03:19:00]  My dad should have  knocked the gun away  Yay!  I got nothing.  What I love about that jingle,  I can hear the hatred  in your voice.  Oh, yeah.  Steve hates the listeners  more than anyone else around here.  It's not...  It's not hate  and it doesn't even fake it.  That's what I love about you.  If they were coming up  with something creative  if the stuff that was coming in  for the last couple weeks  was even...  It took more than  40 seconds of effort 
[03:19:30]  you know,  there'd be a real genuine love  for the work that came in  and it's just not there.  So, you know,  when 50 megabytes of crap  shows up in your email  and you just gotta fire back  a little bit  and that's...  That was wonderful.  All right.  I liked it.  It was a little jingle.  Yeah, people are laughing.  They like it on the...  Almost bordering on song parody, though.  You think?  In its length, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Took a drastic kind of left turn. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, Anthony,  some more stories on the way.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Jeff?  Hey, this is Jeff.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, we had to play  either Red Rocket  or Davy Crockett  when I pledged  and you had the choice.  You either had to  jack off a dog  or fuck one of those hats  with the big tail on it  and the tail was hollow.  You had to just  jack off with the hat.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why wouldn't everybody  choose Davy Crockett?  What'd you say?  You either had to  jack off a dog...  Right.  That's the Red Rocket part.  ...or jerk off  in a furry hat? 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  That's not a choice,  my friend.  A lot of guys  chose the dog.  Who took the dog?  Just someone  who wants to be silly.  Somebody, Randy,  chose the dog.  Todd Johnson  chose the dog.  A whole bunch of guys  chose that dog.  I'm not buying it.  You saw this go down?  Yeah.  A lot of guys  didn't choose the hat  because they didn't know  whose dick  had ever been in that hat.  Oh, I guess  everyone jerks off  in the hat?  Yep.  So, it's a bunch of... 
[03:21:00]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You never know  if there's Ben Gay  or something in the hat?  No, you're just  sticking your dick  in a jizz-stained hat.  Exactly.  Right.  So, it's like jizz crust  in the hat  or you jerk the dog off.  All right, that's...  Goddamn...  No, that's not funny.  That's just gay.  That's just gay.  Kidding.  I get to every month  text on...  He's not listening to you, sir.  All right, let's say  hi to Steve in Mississippi.  Steve, what's up?  Hi, man.  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I'm doing great, man.  I just wanted to call  to let you guys know  that I heard about you guys 
[03:21:30]  for the first time  on Leno Monday.  And when Leno announced  that you guys  was on XM Satellite Radio...  Oh, yeah.  I went out Tuesday morning  and I've been listening  to you guys.  Well, this is my third day.  Wow.  See, that's how it happens.  That's very cool.  What do you think so far?  Oh, man.  Dude, I've been waiting  my whole life  for something like this.  I mean, it's great.  What's your observation?  It's only been three days.  It's always fun  to get the observation  of a newbie.  What do you think  of this show in general?  Like, what are the things 
[03:22:00]  you've noticed, let's say?  The one thing  that I noticed  is you guys are edgy  but you're funny  but even though  you guys are edgy  and funny,  there's still truth  to what you guys say.  Oh, wow.  I like...  And Steve,  a very important question.  Have you ever seen  the movie The Shining?  Yeah.  Okay, great.  You're a perfect listener then.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a prerequisite  to this show.  You're going to hear  the lines from The Shining  over and over  and over 
[03:22:30]  and over again.  I mean,  I listen to you.  But it makes them laugh.  You're being quite willful, Opie.  It makes them laugh  every fucking day  the same fucking lines  over and over.  But it just makes them  laugh and laugh and laugh.  Isn't that odd?  I do find that strange.  I was going to ask you.  I've been listening.  I've been on hold a while  and I was just listening.  Does high school stories count?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, they do, sir. 
[03:23:00]  Well,  what we did in the high school  was the top ten guys  on the football team  that was wanting to be  like the co-captain  or the captain of the team  in our high school.  I don't know if you guys  know what I'm talking about  but in our showers,  it was like a round metal shower  in the very center  and there was like ten knobs  do you know  what I'm talking about?  Yeah, I'm kind of getting it.  It's like a mass shower thing.  It's like a big room  and in the middle of the room  it's just a round cylinder  and it's got, you know,  shower heads.  Yep.  And they would handcuff 
[03:23:30]  the guy to hit it.  Each guy individually  and all the other guys  would like get  a towel wrapped up  and wet it  and just clip them  until they bled.  And then the top five guys  that didn't quit,  then the top five guys,  they would take a cucumber,  put a condom over it  and whoever could put it  up their ass the farthest  was the captain.  Get the fuck out of here.  Was the captain?  I mean, that's not really gay  because...  That's not really gay.  How many years 
[03:24:00]  were you the captain?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  That is so gay.  I'm not the captain.  Well, that's really not gay  because they're not  actually touching each other,  you know?  Yeah.  Sure.  That's how they pick  the wide receiver also.  It's funny.  There's a lot of us  that have done  these weird gay-ish things  but we'll defend  that it's not gay  until I die.  Well, that's not gay.  Cucumber up the ass?  Nah.  I heard Opie earlier,  like I said...  Look, I will defend that. 
[03:24:30]  I am not gay  but it doesn't look good  when you're picking up  fucking marshmallows  with your ass cheeks.  Well, that's what  I was going to tell you.  I've been only listening  for like three days  and I heard you say  something a while ago  about a marshmallow.  I don't know what  that means.  Well, that's the beauty  of the show, too.  You listen long enough  to catch up  with all the inside jokes, too.  A marshmallow in your ass.  Because we tell  the same fucking stories  over and over.  Over and over.  And, sir,  even though you're  a new listener,  I will attest  that these guys  are real men.  They are macho. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hey, man,  it don't matter  if they're men or not.  They're funny as hell.  That's all that matters.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, man.  You know what?  Instead of taking  a basic XM break, Anthony,  I think it would be  not a bad idea  to play Norton's set  from Jay Leno's  Tonight Show.  Yes.  Norton left early.  He's going to be  at the Improv in Dallas  all weekend long  at the Addison Improv.  And that guy  was turned on to the show  by Norton being on Jay Leno.  I think it all just  kind of makes sense  to play this right now.  Sure.  And don't forget,  we're going to be  at the RCS Experience 
[03:25:30]  of New York City,  56 in Madison,  starting at noon today  with lots of stuff  to give away.  It should be a lot of fun.  Nice.  But we'll do this  and then we'll come back  and we'll end the show  with more of your stories  because the stories  are coming in.  I want to give Danny  a chance to screen  the calls  and get the better ones  for us to go to, okay?  Right.  But first,  here's Lul Jimmy Norton  on Jay Leno's  Tonight Show.  All righty.  My next guest,  Bright County,  the comedian  from New York City.  He's on the OPN  and Anthony show  on XM Satellite Radio 
[03:26:00]  every single morning.  June 25th,  he'll be at the State Theater  in Falls Church, Virginia.  Please welcome  Jim Norton.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How are you?  There's always this weird moment  when you first look  at the audience.  Like, I'm hoping  you're going to be  a great crowd  and you guys are kind of  looking and hoping  I don't suck.  And the most common question  you get as a comedian,  what happens if you tell a joke  and it bombs? 
[03:26:30]  To be honest,  I tend to just go  to the next joke.  There aren't exactly  a lot of options.  It's not like I can  run through the room  and tickle you individually.  And it's not uncomfortable  for a comic.  It's a part of our job.  The reason that  frightens audience members  is because in your own lives  you don't have  the next joke option.  It's much harder  to bomb in real life.  Like, you ever try  to be funny  around your girlfriend's family  or your co-workers  and it gets a zero?  Like, the kind of bomb  where they just avoid  eye contact with you  for a little while? 
[03:27:00]  You got to just stand there  and soak in your humiliation  with your stupid  eye-bombed face?  You ever try  to play it off  like you didn't mean  it to be funny?  You ever have a joke  bomb so badly  it may have been  a serious statement?  So you try to sneak  out of it by going  oh, I'm just saying.  You know, maybe you're  at work, the big meeting  is about to start  your boss walks in  there's no eye in team  you're like, yeah  but there's two in syphilis. 
[03:27:30]  I'm just saying.  I'm actually enjoying  my time back in Los Angeles.  I live in New York  I got ripped off  this week, man.  I went for a massage.  Did you know  there are  legitimate massage places? 
[03:28:00]  I honestly got  had no idea.  I thought she was kidding.  She finishes with my feed  she's like, all done.  And I'm like, it was awful.  I'm on my stomach  for 55 minutes  she finally turns me over  and she said, all right  I'm going to crack your toes  which means she grabs  each toe, squeezes it  and yanks on it  which, you know  right idea, wrong location.  Yeah.  I felt like such a creep  every time she grabbed a toe  I tried to scooch down  two and a half feet. 
[03:28:30]  I'm a lonely man.  I've been single almost three years, kind of playing the field.  I call it playing the field.  You might call it picking up prostitutes.  And I've fallen into this place with this girl I know, this horrible place.  But I have become the guy friend.  Is there anything more repulsive than being the guy friend?  And women, you always know when we like you.  And you deny it even to your girlfriends.  You're like, I think he's in love with you. 
[03:29:00]  You're like, I know, we're just friends.  He enjoys taking me to the airport.  And there is nothing worse as a man than when you're hitting on a woman and she has that awful, blocking male friend.  Because you can just feel his energy.  You're trying to talk to her.  He's like, dude, don't hurt her.  She's like my sister.  Is she really, you fun-draining cancer?  Why does a guy always make a sister figure out of some braless model who looks like Jessica Simpson? 
[03:29:30]  Listen, you never hear a man claiming that about a fat chick with facial hair.  Even if she is your sister, you keep it under your hat.  Who's that?  I don't know.  We met at a barbecue once.  I think we have the same parents.  So I don't know what to do about this girl I like.  I really am very uncomfortable around women.  I know you look at me and you think, God, it must be so easy for you.  If I get really nervous, I mean, this is just a front. 
[03:30:00]  And for me, making the first move means you roll down the passenger window, you know, beep, beep.  If she gets in, you hope it's not a guy.  You ever make that mistake?  You don't get your money back.  That's why my motto is, toughen up and finish. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, look, I'm not gay.  This is a matter of economics.  I wish I was gay.  Gay men are lucky.  You can go out and rob banks.  If you get caught and go to jail, eh.  Thanks a lot, everybody.  You guys were great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So are you liking L.A. now?  I know you are a dyed-in-wool New York.  Are you enjoying your time here?  I actually, I used to hate L.A., but I have one stupid hobby, and L.A. is great for that. 
[03:31:00]  I get pictures with celebrities, which I annoyed you for the first time I was here.  And I've been doing it for years, and it's very rare that I've ever turned down by a celebrity for a picture or an autograph.  And I finally realized why.  It's because I look like I could be a problem.  Yeah.  There is just something about my rapidly blinking eyes.  That's why I took the picture, yeah.  I just, I don't want to be a problem with this guy.  It's not that people think I'm going to kick their ass, but I do look like I might bite your face.  And I came to realize this years ago. 
[03:31:30]  I'm an Ozzy Osbourne fanatic, and my friend sneaks me into MTV.  He's like, all right, man, just kind of hang back.  So I walk by an open dressing room door, and there is Ozzy.  So I stare.  And Ozzy is talking, and he looks out at me.  And when he looks at me, I smiled and licked my lips.  And he kind of walked out of view, so I couldn't stare at him anymore.  And I realized I'd made him uncomfortable.  And then it dawned on me, do you know what a weirdo you have to look like to make Ozzy Osbourne?  Exactly. 
[03:32:00]  Well, any other celebrities that you've seen?  I don't even necessarily have to be a fan.  I remember I was opening for Dice in Vegas years ago, and Tiger Woods was in the crowd.  I don't like golf.  I think golf sucks, and golf clubs are great for assaulting people.  Yeah.  But I like Tiger Woods, so I walk up to him after the show, and I'm nervous.  And I'm like, you know, hello, Mr. Woods.  And he is such a sweet guy.  He's like, you were awesome.  Which was odd to hear a black guy go, awesome.  Yeah, he's black. 
[03:32:30]  And I wanted to have, like, a nice moment with him.  I just got really intimidated.  He's like, you were awesome.  I'm like, thanks, man.  You golf good.  You ever open your mouth and wish you had a shotgun with a toe attachment?  I have one second with this icon.  I sound like an extra from M.A.S.H.  You golf good.  Me have head wound, Hawkeye. 
[03:33:00]  Well, how about dating?  Are you seeing anyone right now?  I do.  I give people the creeps.  It's hard for me to date.  Hard to date, yeah.  I have a tendency to be too toothy when I smile, which really grosses a girl out if you're in a boy.  You're like, where are you from?  And then I rub my hands together vigorously while staring at her cleavage and mumbling, nice.  I can see how that could be a problem.  Hi.  Hi. 
[03:33:30]  Hey, did you, uh...  I'm just stumbling about problems every once in a while.  Yeah.  Seventeen.  What's that?  Seventeen.  Ooh, you're old.  Now, did you watch the Tyson fight, Sam?  Uh, the Tyson fight, I actually did not watch.  I had probably my most embarrassing experience trying to get a Tyson autograph years ago in New York.  About five years ago, Mike Tyson's outside the comedy show with a big entourage, and I go up to get an autograph, and his bodyguard goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, man, where are you going? 
[03:34:00]  And I said, oh, man, I just wanted to get an autograph.  He goes, sorry, man, Mike's not meeting anyone tonight.  And I actually said, but he's the champ.  I was 31 years old, and I regressed to five-year-old boy talk to get the signature of a rapist from Brooklyn.  But he's the champ. 
[03:34:30]  Jim, very funny.  He's on the opening anthony show every morning on satellite radio, and, of course, at the State's Interpol, South Virginia.  Thank you, buddy.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Or maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me. 
[03:35:00]  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T.F. thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite doral treat.  My favorite eating cock. 
[03:35:30]  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  After I whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Doral.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Oh.  Oh.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Oh, God.  After I suck you off, I want you to bang me up the ass. 
[03:36:00]  I'm hungry for a hard-mailed cock.  Patty.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the bananas.  Oh, God.  I like the bananas.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy talking in my mouth.  I enjoy talking between the boobs.  I enjoy talking in my tight ass. 
[03:36:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  She's a freak.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  She's a freak.  Hi.  Oh, we're running out of program. 
[03:37:00]  I hate when this happens.  Especially when we're on a roll and we have somewhere to go.  I know.  We got that appearance in a little while, about an hour from now.  We didn't get to talk about the wife that got shot.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get into that tomorrow because, I mean, this is something that Anthony can  kind of relate to.  I kind of understand.  Also, the Hamptons Warpath thing is a pretty funny story.  My condo. 
[03:37:30]  My house.  And then another great Michael Jackson cartoon in the New York Post.  Well, this one's pretty simple.  I guess we could get this out of the way real fast.  This guy in the New York Post, do you know who does these cartoons?  No.  On page six?  Well, he's very edgy.  Yeah.  And very politically incorrect.  And we love that.  And very honest.  We love that.  We absolutely love that.  You know, they go right for the jugular with their jokes.  And basically, you know, everyone knows Michael Jackson got acquitted.  And he told his lawyer that the kids will not be sleeping over anymore. 
[03:38:00]  Nope.  So there's a cartoon in the Post today.  It shows Michael Jackson in a tub with his sunglasses on with a little rubber ducky.  Yeah.  And a little boy.  Little boy in the bathtub with him.  Up to the, the water's up to his nipples.  Mm-hmm.  Looking all uncomfortable.  Like, why is he in this bathtub with Michael Jackson with a rubber ducky in between them?  And then the lawyer is pulling back the curtain to look at this scene.  Mm-hmm.  And the caption says, well, it's Michael Jackson talking. 
[03:38:30]  He says, no, I said I wouldn't bring anyone into my bedroom.  I didn't say anything about the other room.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  He goes, Michael Jackson won't be bringing any more children into his bedroom and sharing his bed with them.  Doesn't mean he's not going to be taking them in the bathtub, perhaps.  Or in hotel rooms.  I said my bed.  Right.  Yes, Kenny?  Oh, boy.  Kenny has something to add.  No, I tried to get.  That's never promising.  No.  I have to say it that way. 
[03:39:00]  I'm sorry, Kenny.  I tried to get into Michael Jackson's, like, celebration party, but I was too old.  Anyway, Anthony.  I guess you won't be hitting that mic button again.  This guy, Ivan, from Minnesota.  Fake name, right, Ivan?  I've got to.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  You're an ex-NHL player?  Well, I'm a current NHL player if we have a season ever again.  Really?  Who do you play with?  I can't tell you that. 
[03:39:30]  Then these guys are going to get the shit kicked out of me on the ice because I'm going to tell you the sickest fucks in the world are professional athletes.  Because, you know, you're in the locker room all the time.  But they, man, you talk about hazing.  There's no getting out of it because these fucking guys just attack the shit out of you.  Yeah.  I was playing NCAA hockey, and as a freshman, Division I hockey, they literally tackle the shit out of you.  There's a little noose, like a little hangman's noose that's in the locker room that's always there, and that's for freshmen. 
[03:40:00]  And what they do is they tackle the shit out of you.  They then hold you down.  They take your cock into this noose, and they hold it up.  They then shave your balls, shave your chest hair, shave everything, including your head.  They then take a hockey stick and attach your feet and legs to it, kind of like you're a pig on a spit.  This is after practice, and then they toss you out onto the ice. 
[03:40:30]  Well, keep in mind, the cheerleaders practice after our practice.  So there's a good thing and a bad thing.  All right, hold on.  Cheerleaders in hockey?  Yeah.  You had me until then.  I was just going to say that.  You had me until the cheerleaders in hockey.  Cheerleaders in hockey, huh?  Two-way, they got cheerleaders in hockey.  I'm not kidding you.  All right, continue.  All right, they toss you out on the ice, and you better hold it.  I've never seen a hockey cheer.  I know.  Brr, brr, we're cold.  You'll sit out on the ice for three fucking hours, freezing your balls off. 
[03:41:00]  Otherwise, the cheerleaders got to unstrap you and everything else.  But I got to tell you, you know, and then you get into the NHL, I can't even talk about that shit.  What team do you play for?  Come on.  And why can't you talk about what happens in the NHL?  No one knows who you are.  So one or the other.  Because I'm on my way to a players' meeting.  Right now.  And I guarantee you, these fucking guys got...  I'll tell you what.  Everybody listens to you guys.  You guys...  In fact, I got in on this deal the first day of October of last year, and I paid for it, 
[03:41:30]  and I paid for it.  I would continue paying for it.  All right.  And...  We're blowing up in the NHL, Anthony.  A lot of NHL players.  I hope there's a season.  What do you think?  I love my Rangers.  That's all I'll tell you.  Uh-huh.  You're a Ranger?  Yeah.  He's a Ranger.  I'll tell you what.  If you put Stevie on the line afterwards, I'll stop up the next time I'm in town.  All right.  All right.  That'll prove that you're the real deal.  Hold on.  All right, bro.  There you go.  Ivan, fake name, talking about hockey hazing. 
[03:42:00]  There's so many great stories to go to, Anthony, but I think we've pretty much run out of  time, unfortunately.  Jim Norton's going to be at the Addison Improv in Dallas all weekend long, I think starting  tonight.  16, 17, 18, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, probably, or Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  No, tonight.  Starting tonight.  16?  Starting tonight.  Today's the 16th?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  All right.  And Anthony and I are going to be at the RCS Experience in New York City at noon today,  56 in Madison.  Just get your ass over there.  If you're close by, there's tons and tons of stuff, truckloads of stuff for us to give 
[03:42:30]  away and throw at you people.  And a lot of you guys are on hold with some great stories, you know, just because the show  ends doesn't mean this bit ends, so either call tomorrow or when you think about, uh, what  do you think?  Oh, I couldn't even finish my stage.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
