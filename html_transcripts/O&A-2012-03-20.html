<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the mobile game "Draw Something," highlighting its coin system, rampant cheating (specifically by a listener nicknamed "Iraq"), and the often offensive and racist drawings submitted by players.  This segued into a wide-ranging discussion touching on the unusually warm spring weather, the overheating problems with the new iPad 3 (with a humorous, offensive aside about laptops and Black people), Tiger Woods' declining golf career and his video game, Tim Tebow's NFL future, a hockey brawl between the New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils, the fall from grace of Jeremy Lin, and a frustrating meeting with SiriusXM management that ended with studio vandalism and no consequences.  They also commented satirically on Michelle Obama's family's Mexican vacation and the White House dog.  Callers, including "Coke Logic" and "Iraq," participated throughout this segment. Jim Norton's upcoming TV appearance was mentioned.

The show then shifted to a lengthy debate about Peyton Manning's free agency and move to the Denver Broncos.  This involved discussions of Manning's negotiating tactics (described as "holding teams hostage"), his diva-like behavior, comparisons to Brett Favre, the impact on Tim Tebow and other players, the financial aspects of his contract, and speculation about his reasons for choosing Denver.  In-studio guest Florentine provided football commentary, and numerous callers offered their opinions. This portion also included a fictional radio drama, "Butt Trek," and a mock Elton John interview.

Following this, a discussion about the evolution of hip-hop and heavy metal music ensued, heavily featuring comedian Jim Florentine (in-studio), who argued against hip-hop's evolution, sparking a heated debate with co-host Troy Kwan and several callers.  Florentine promoted his one-man show, and the hosts discussed SiriusXM layoffs (including the fate of a former colleague, Elo), Mayor Bloomberg's homeless policy, John Montone's news reporting style, and Katy Perry's altered performance of "Niggas in Paris."

This musical debate continued into the next segment, with Opie, Anthony, Florentine, and Kwan engaging in a chaotic exchange of rapper names, insults, and vulgarity. Florentine’s departure was announced due to a prior commitment.  The remainder of this section focused on mocking viewer complaints about the Super Bowl halftime show and commercials, specifically M.I.A.'s middle finger and scantily clad women.  A song by K-Wise was played.

The show then moved to a rapid-fire sequence of topics: a painful medical treatment, a listener's complaint about a Kim Kardashian Skechers ad, a vulgar anecdote about a gym employee named Edgar, accusations against Sam Roberts, and the reading of a Gawker tweet alleging a comedian forces female comics to watch him masturbate.  The hosts speculated on the comedian's identity, eventually settling on Michael Richards.  This transitioned to a discussion about bathroom habits and then to "After 1A Live" with Sam Roberts, focusing on listener feedback on Jim Norton's recurring characters (Edgar, Uncle Paul, Ted Sheckler, Valley Jim).  A listener call detailed a disturbing Jim Norton elevator character impersonation involving violent and misogynistic language towards a pregnant woman.  A West Coast marijuana anecdote was shared, followed by a call about Helen Bergeron.  A dispute between Troy and Kenny regarding the "Busy Buddies Show" ensued, followed by a discussion about rap music and the use of racial slurs. Finally, a guest appearance by Nicole from the Morning Mashup introduced heavy sexual conversation centered on Nicole's sexual history and preferences.  The show concluded with more speculation about Jim Norton's characters, further discussion of Nicole’s sex life, and a concluding mention of the Knicks and Linsanity.

The final segment focused on an internal conflict with Kenny, whose return after an absence was marked by aggressive criticism.  This escalated into a discussion of music preferences (specifically a vulgar critique of Nickelback), the use of the n-word in song lyrics (referencing Kanye West), and the absurdity of its taboo status. The segment concluded with an argument between the hosts stemming from a cancelled Chris Jericho guest appearance, further fueled by frustration with the MTA.  The show then transitioned to Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  E-J-Dang open-ended, don't listen to the D-A-O-M-E-N-D.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddamn it.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, that makes me feel bad every morning. Makes me feel bad. 
[00:01:00]  That he doesn't want to introduce us.  I know, I would think he would be honored.  Why, why, why?  Why, why, why?  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  I got a half-hearted good morning.  Did you?  Yeah, maybe he's under the weather.  I get a robust good morning, and I come right back at him.  He goes, good morning.  I'm like, here's what it sounds like in there.  Good morning.  Good morning, good morning, good morning.  Welcome aboard, welcome aboard.  Like, I jump right on him. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning, good morning.  That's me.  I love it.  I got taped that motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  He rules.  My eyes are burning.  They're on fire this morning.  Again.  What happened?  You see Seal and Heidi Klum photos?  Yes, I tried to claw them out of my head.  Oh, that draws something.  Yeah, we were talking about this yesterday, and I don't really understand the game still.  But a lot of people are really digging this.  A lot of people don't understand it. 
[00:02:00]  A lot of people don't like it.  A lot of people don't.  But, boy, it seems to be taking off.  Why?  It's one of these fucking, it's one of these games that are on your phone or on the iPad  that just seem to be one of those games that people like playing.  That's Lil Wayne right there.  Lil Wayne.  See, yeah, there's a bunch of pictures up on the line.  Someone could draw Lil Wayne that well or draw something?  Oh, shit.  Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne.  Wow.  They're terrible pictures. 
[00:02:30]  They're horrible pictures.  Oh, that Lil Wayne.  I knew that one.  Look.  Elvis.  I know that one.  There, see?  Elvis.  Elvis.  Yeah.  The, uh...  I don't get the gist of this, though.  Well, you...  Who wins?  Well, you...  Don't you have to have a winner?  No.  No.  So what?  There's cheating involved?  Well, I think there is some cheating involved now.  Iraq has spoken of some cheating that goes on now.  He apparently just draws a red box now.  Yeah.  Because here's the gist of the game.  You get a person that you have to draw a picture for. 
[00:03:00]  But where do you find this game?  Let's start there.  I don't even know.  It's an app.  Just put draw something in the fucking...  Through Facebook?  Through Twitter?  Through fucking GetGlue?  Through fucking Tumblr?  Where are we at?  I guess through Facebook you could.  Okay.  But it's on the iPhone.  You get to go to the app store.  You get the app.  Yeah.  And then you just fucking start drawing shit.  And there's a list of words that comes up.  One word is one coin.  Another word's two coins.  Another word's three coins.  Depending on how hard they are. 
[00:03:30]  Then you kind of got to draw whatever the word is.  And the person that you're drawing for has to guess what the word is.  And, you know, spell it out there on his end.  And if they guess right, what happens?  They get three coins.  And you get three coins.  I hate the coins.  Well, the coins.  With the coins, you can buy more colors.  So you can make your drawings more detailed.  They don't even give you all the colors?  No.  So you got to earn the coins.  Oh, fuck this stupid game.  I want all the colors.  There are other things you could buy.  Like there's certain ways where if you can't figure out what someone drew. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  You could hit this bomb button.  And it blows out a bunch of letters.  And only keeps in less letters.  So it's easier to figure out what it is.  What if you draw something really nice.  And they don't get it.  Then they don't get coins.  Do you get coins?  I don't think you get coins.  So you need them to figure out what you're drawing?  Yeah, yeah.  They got to figure it out.  What if they want to be assholes and just never guess it properly?  Then you slide over their name and delete them from your little fucking list.  Ah, good. 
[00:04:30]  You know, there's always a way to throw someone out in this new age of internet.  Always some way to boot someone out of your fun.  Your fun time.  Remember when all that first started, we all felt weird about blocking people and stuff.  Because, hey, man, that's not cool.  It's the internet.  It should be open and free.  Now it's all the rage.  Goodbye, everybody.  Goodbye.  It's all the rage.  Goodbye.  Fuck that.  Bon voyage.  Fuck that giving everyone a chance.  No, fuck it.  We all crossed the threshold.  And now it's all about blocking the errors.  I love a good block. 
[00:05:00]  I love a good boot.  Yeah, so I was playing last night, and I see this trend that's been happening, which is  nothing short of hilarious.  Is it a trend with just you?  No.  Because I know where you're going.  You're sure it's just...  It's not just me, because it's people that are drawing things that I have to guess.  So it's not just me.  But they're trying to become friends with you.  Well, there are some listeners, but there are people that aren't listeners.  Okay.  All right.  And I've just noticed this.  And no, knowing basic human nature, I see this happening just because human beings are 
[00:05:30]  like this.  There's a few words that pop up a couple of times a night.  Like what?  Give me one.  Elton is one.  Elton.  As in Elton John?  Elton John.  Okay.  So I've gotten to the point where all I do now is like old school fucking concentration  rules.  I draw a letter L plus, and then I draw a weight with 2,000 LBS on it.  Elton. 
[00:06:00]  There.  Fucking just get it over with.  Kind of creative.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit there and try to draw Elton John.  A little different.  But some people are very good artists, and sometimes you will see the greatest picture  of a piano and a flamboyantly dressed man playing the piano and stuff.  Sunglasses.  Sunglasses.  The big sunglasses.  The feathers and everything.  Right.  Musical notes coming out of the piano.  They really get into it.  Oh, they get into it.  But nobody has yet to draw something like that, which is very nice.  They do that. 
[00:06:30]  Without also including a thought bubble with a cock in it.  It's just...  It always goes to that level.  It goes to cock.  It goes to...  It's like, I could have gotten the Elton John.  You did a great job.  It didn't need the thought bubble cock.  But he wasn't confident in his drawing abilities, obviously.  Wasn't confident enough.  You're right.  And I see the racism is coming into play now, too, because one clue was...  And I had to do this, and it was the only way I could really figure it out, to really 
[00:07:00]  put it over the top.  Japan was one of the words.  And I had to draw something.  Just Japan.  Yes.  That would convey Japan.  What shape is Japan?  Well, that's just it.  You could do map shapes.  Isn't it like a J?  It's kind of like a backwards California.  Backwards California.  Yeah, sort of.  Backwards almost, Jay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of.  That's Japan right there, right?  Yeah, a little like that.  I did good.  Look.  You can't...  It's great.  You see their nose or Japan.  You can't draw me. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Or draw something.  No.  So you have to draw something where people go, oh, Japan.  Right.  So I drew a white flag with the red dot in the middle.  Mm-hmm.  Japanese flag.  Mm-hmm.  And then I have it planted in the ground with a, like a Mount Fuji kind of mountain in the  background.  But then I can't resist putting it over.  I got to put it over the top.  So I draw the round head, the two slit up and down for the eyes, and then big teeth, 
[00:08:00]  buck, two buck teeth in front, and a pointy hat.  All right.  I'm starting to like this game.  On your phone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You draw all this on your phone?  Yes.  It's very difficult.  People do it on the iPad.  It's a lot easier.  Oh, okay.  But on the phone, yeah, you kind of get used to it.  Yeah.  But with an iPad, I'll be a whiz.  Do you grow one of your nails nice and long?  No, you can't really use your nail on the iPhone front.  Why not?  It doesn't really pick up that well.  So you're just smudging a picture when you're...  No, there's different size brushes that you can use.  So no matter how big your big finger is on there, you'll get a little thin line. 
[00:08:30]  Gotcha.  And then you need a thicker one, a thicker one, colors, things like that.  You know, I went into this hating draw something, but you're kind of turning me on to the game.  It's becoming a thing, though.  Yeah, that is...  You get the racism, the sexism, too, where women...  So why don't they have individual games where you could, like, jump on a game called racist draw something or...  Well, that's probably just called draw something now.  It's getting to that point.  Because that would just be funny for...  And I mean everyone.  I don't care what color you are. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You would enjoy...  It's hilarious.  Racist draw something.  Yeah.  Another guy wanted to convey the word pink to me.  And he went through the toil of drawing a girl spread eagle, drew her legs and her pussy and that,  and then drew her pussy lips and colored them in pink.  Was he good at it?  And then put a little arrow and drew her asshole.  Nice.  And then he drew an arrow to the asshole and went, the stink.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:09:30]  And then I had to guess, oh, the pink.  Right.  So I put pink.  Right.  See?  There's a lot of cheating going on.  No, the cheating is...  That's kind of cheating.  Iraq is cheating.  That's not...  I don't consider that cheating because you're not using any of the words.  Right.  That, like, you know, you could rhyme.  You could do certain things in context.  You know what a cheat is.  What Iraq is doing is absolutely cheating.  Iraq, why don't you tell everybody how you play Draw Something.  By the way, the king of Get Glue is about to talk.  Ah, yes, of course. 
[00:10:00]  I'm calling you the king of Get Glue.  Thank you.  I have many stickers.  Yes.  Yes.  He's all about to talk.  Ew, I hate those stickers.  Yeah, we'll talk about that.  He's something.  Iraq, what are you doing?  Why are you ruining Draw Something?  It just got to the point where there was just so many game requests and people take forever.  So I got to the point where I was like, I'm not even going to bother anymore.  I just draw a big red box.  And then with the black color, I draw the word for what they have to guess. 
[00:10:30]  So all they got to do is look at the word and type it in and everyone wins.  Everyone wins.  I would so just ban you.  Yeah, see, there's flaws in the game.  No, there's not flaws in the game.  There's flaws in Iraq.  And he can be banned.  Well, can't Draw Something figure out where it's impossible to make letters.  I don't know.  Or if you start making letters, they null and void that particular game or something.  They open it up to the people.  If you want to play like that, fine.  But you know what?  You'll never play.  That's an example of somebody. 
[00:11:00]  They just wrote turkey.  They just write turkey.  And so I'm putting turkey.  And that's it.  You forgot the foot.  Ah, turkey foot, Uncle Paul.  There are some fans that are on there, though.  And wow is a word.  And they show a girl showing her tits.  So I was like, ah, okay, I get it.  And Uncle Paul.  Like uncle.  I need a game where someone wins, though.  Well, it's not really a winning thing.  It's you each get to earn some, you know, I have over a thousand coins now to purchase 
[00:11:30]  various colors and various bombs so I could hit and change words or get that.  Oh, yeah.  This will go for another maybe three, four days and I'll be done with it.  But for now.  And then we'll all jump onto something else.  For now, it's like one of those quick, easy, potato chip-like app games.  No, the racist angle.  That's hilarious.  I'm certainly not as racist as you, sir.  But I would play racist Draw Something.  There are a lot of celebrity names that pop up.  And the black celebrities, you will notice when people draw them, it is nothing short 
[00:12:00]  of a minstrel show blackface that is put on the person.  Yeah, something like that.  That's a good Kobe right there.  That's Kobe.  Just a very black guy in a Lakers jersey.  Well, I saw a Kobe.  With his number as well.  I saw a Kobe and then with an arrow pointing toward him, it said, rapist.  So, you know, you would get you.  So it puts it over the top.  It lets you go, oh, okay.  I wasn't sure.  Now I'm sure it's Kobe. 
[00:12:30]  That looks like a cookie in a Lakers uniform.  Yes.  The face is very old school.  It looks like one of those old 1930s black exploitation pieces you could buy.  Like an old ad.  Like an old ad for fucking syrup or watermelons or something.  Yeah.  And that's every, like, black guy or woman that has to be on Drawing.  Why did Draw Something take off?  It seems so stupid.  But everyone's playing.  I know that.  But the dumb things, the quick, dumb, easy to do for two seconds, you know, just do something. 
[00:13:00]  You could put it down, pick it up later.  Those things are the things that take off.  You know, with the Words with Friends is the same thing.  It's like, you know, and you get to play with other people.  That's another thing.  Playing in a community seems to be the biggest thing.  But there's a lot of cheating going on with Words with Friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see that.  Websites dedicated to getting some nice words together.  And people just punching in letters until it turns green and, you know, makes a word they don't even know. 
[00:13:30]  I never got into that one.  But the Draw Something, eh, it's right up my alley.  I kind of like it.  And E-Roc's done.  He's just writing the words now.  E-Roc's just writing the words.  I'm just guilty of it.  They've got to come up with more words is the problem.  So I'm guilty of drawing the exact same thing when the word comes up.  I'll be like, oh, I'll draw another sheriff.  But the words are already all out there.  So why don't they have enough words?  I don't know.  I guess they didn't think it would take off like this.  And a lot of people are playing.  But what would...  They need more words. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, but why don't they just have more words?  What would be the issue?  I don't know.  Just get more words.  Huh?  The free version has less words.  Oh, I'm playing the free version?  Than the pay version.  But now, wait a minute.  You have to buy more words.  If I get more words and I get the pay version, what about if I'm playing someone with the  free version?  They're not going to be getting those words, are they?  It's a great question.  Oh, very good question.  It's a great question.  Oh, my God.  Is that a great question?  I don't know.  My God, man.  I guess I'll get the pay version.  Every black guy looks like a banned Warner Brothers cartoon. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Came from Connecticut.  Oh, it is?  Yes, yes.  Every single black guy looks terrible.  Looks like an old...  You want to hear from Coke Logic?  Sure.  Coke Logic knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  He knows how to draw.  Yeah.  Chicago.  Hey, what's going on?  How warm is it there today?  I think I was just out driving.  It was like 65 degrees.  Going up to 120 in Chicago today.  That's what I heard.  We're already at like 60 in New York.  First day of spring.  It's foggy out today.  Stupid trees are starting to bloom.  Good morning. 
[00:15:00]  Good.  You see the trees blooming?  Hell yeah, yo's.  You see that slight tint of green?  Yes, in the trees.  In the forest?  I went around and surveyed my yard yesterday with my hands in my pocket, walking around  my yard, looking down, looking up.  You can't wait.  And I'm just like, yep, yep.  I see some buds coming in on the ground and things.  Pools opening April 2nd.  Jesus.  Pool opening April 2nd.  Oh, good.  Second.  Did you walk around your backyard looking for damage from the winter?  Yeah, I did.  I kind of looked around.  Lost a couple branches.  I opened up the backyard shitter to see if anything froze. 
[00:15:30]  No, it wasn't cold enough.  And my pumps all worked.  Everything was great.  I was like a homeowner, just, yep, yep, yep, surveying the lay of the land here, lay  of the land.  I feel like you just closed that pool like two weeks ago.  Ah, boy, it's been...  We skated.  We did skate.  Hey, I still have wood left from the one load of wood that I got.  I didn't even go through all that.  Of course.  I usually go through five loads of wood, and I didn't go through one this season.  That's creepy.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:16:00]  Fucking great.  Everyone, we're all thinking the same thing.  What the fuck's going on for real?  Who cares?  You could argue that global warming and all that, that's fun, but...  Who cares?  Do you think it's going to be fast enough that we'll have to deal with it?  Every single person has in the back of their head, what the fuck does this mean?  But it's not the warmest winter on record, so it's like, so what?  It just was another anomaly that has happened.  Hopefully.  Coke-a-logic.  What do you got there, buddy?  Yeah, first splurge on the 99 cents there, you get 2,000 words, 2,000 extra words to play 
[00:16:30]  with, so you're not getting the same 15 over and over.  I'm there.  Oh, why don't you do that, Ian?  I'm there.  You got 99 cents.  Done deal.  And one thing I love to see on Draw Something is they give you the letters of, like, what  it could possibly be, all jumbled up with a couple of extra, but you'll see someone slowly  starting to draw a picture, and then you're like, oh, it's a guitar.  So you type it in, boom, and then all of a sudden you see that they spent, like, 15 to 
[00:17:00]  20 minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  15 minutes.  Wait, what's this about?  Let me...  Coke-a-logic.  Let me explain this real quick.  Here's what happens.  But as soon as you guess it, it should shut off the other guy's drawing capabilities.  No, you know what it is?  He drew it.  He perhaps drew this the day before.  Oh, I gotcha.  You're seeing it as if he was drawing it and trying to guess it, but it's in, like, a memory  somewhere.  Gotcha.  And when you punch it up, that's when it starts drawing.  So you're not sitting there as he's drawing it trying to guess it.  Right. 
[00:17:30]  But you see it as if he's drawing it.  Gotcha.  So now, the second you guess it and put in the letters, it's done.  And then his entire drawing comes to life instantly.  It's like, bam!  So you'll see, like he said, a guitar.  You'll know it's a guitar from the first fucking three lines.  Write guitar in there.  And then you'll see that he did.  He spent 20 minutes making the most intricate drawing of a guitar.  And you'll never see it for more than a split second since he's done. 
[00:18:00]  But yes, that's why I'm Mr. Stick Figure Guy.  By the way, Panicky Pete hung up.  Oh, did he?  I think it takes a lot for Coke Logic to get himself together to call the show.  He didn't want to be annoying guy.  And he just hangs up.  I like how he shut his fucking mouth when we went on a little tangent, though.  Perfect phone call.  Listeners got to know how that works.  So that's why your eyes are killing you?  Yeah, so, you know, I do put on my reading glasses.  I have my glasses on when I play that game because I can't see, god damn it. 
[00:18:30]  What did you do with your iPad?  Ugh.  Well, I have to get an iPad.  You don't have an iPad?  Well, I did, but you know something?  When you're sharing a domicile, you lose your iPad.  What happened?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I know.  The chick took the fucking iPad.  You're sharing an iPad?  No, I'm not sharing one.  I don't have one now.  You should have had two to begin with.  I gave away a couple of them because I had the new one that ain't mine anymore.  Take it back.  Hey, take it back. 
[00:19:00]  No, because now I'm going to go get the new one.  Oh, good.  Leave her with the old fucking wooden one.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what, but her legs won't heat up.  So, you know, there's a story in the paper today.  People are not happy with their iPad 3.  Why?  The damn thing is heating up.  Oh, no.  A lot.  The little legs are getting warm.  It's working hard.  Where is it?  It was in the paper.  I just read it.  It's working very diligently.  That's true.  Laptops do the same thing.  Yeah, laptop.  A lot of people are bitching that this iPad 3 is heating up fast, and then they've got  to turn down the screen, and now it's not, you know, to fucking get the temperature  down.  Oh, shit. 
[00:19:30]  I think it's relax.  I like using it in ice water.  That way it keeps it cool.  Everything's fine.  And it's fucking just rocking the battery quickly.  Yeah.  Supposedly.  Well, you've got to keep those things plugged in.  They're starting to think there might be a little bit of a flaw in the iPad 3.  Oh, shit.  Hey, look, everybody's trying to be a hater.  You're just trying to be a hater because you, uh...  It was in the paper.  I'm just reporting.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, I got an iPad.  You know, I got the first one still.  Oh, shit.  And I don't feel like I'm missing anything.  What am I missing? 
[00:20:00]  What?  Camera?  Be honest with me.  Shit.  What am I really missing?  I don't know.  Nothing.  That's fucking written at display.  I think the people that hold us up and take pictures look like idiots.  That looks...  You look like Ansel Adams.  Right.  That's fucking silly.  Let me get my photo plate.  Yeah, it is kind of silly.  Yeah, does it come with a sheet?  You put it over your head.  Put it over your head, old school.  But I guess the video capability in the iPad 3 would be cool.  Yeah, it's one of those things where...  Then this would be worth picking up and doing shit with it.  Because then you could edit it right on there and upload it.  I get that. 
[00:20:30]  It's all one-stop shopping.  But lifting it up to take a picture.  It does look dumb when you see someone taking a picture with a big dopey iPad.  Yeah.  What do you got on the iPad 3?  Am I right there, Sam?  Yeah.  Big article today.  This is a big one.  Well, because there's a much bigger battery in the new iPad because of the retina display.  So people are complaining that it's heating up.  Heating up.  There is a problem, too, with the laptops and stuff that heat up.  And people actually put them on their lap.  Have you read about this one?  They're leaving skin discolorations.  Because if you put heat on you long enough, your skin will literally discolor and get darker. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  And people are getting their laps.  Is that how we got Negroes?  Yes.  We invented the laptop many years ago.  Is that how the Negroes were invented?  Yes.  Sorry, Negroes.  And it does.  Just a joke.  Stupid joke.  On the thighs and lap or wherever you have this heat on you for any length of time slowly  starts to discolor your skin.  How bad is it?  And you'll get like a brown tinge to the area. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  How bad is that for your balls?  That's got to be fucking testicle cancer waiting to happen.  That can't be good.  That's why.  I don't think I ever use a laptop on my fucking lap.  Never.  No.  Ixnay on the tumor shit.  You know what's going through our heads every day?  I'll say it every time this comes up.  What?  Headphones?  This is a...  Yeah.  And a stupid laptop on our balls is easy compared to what's going on in our headphones every day.  I always forget to take mine off.  They're just assuming that this satellite shit's okay?  What all the fucking...  Was it tested properly?  RF waves going through us right now. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Electrically off.  We're in a fucking small room with what amounts to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 monitors.  Are you serious?  There are 19...  Is there really 19?  19 screens are live in this room right now.  Yeah.  I love when they go, well, cell phones, dangerous to your health.  I laugh at that shit.  Cell phones.  Do radio for 30 years. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Who knows?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Well, that's my big game.  Travis, why are you in here?  Trav dog.  You guys were talking about the iPad.  No, we weren't.  No, I know you were.  I was listening.  Yes, you were.  Yes, you were.  We weren't.  Travis, you using it or is someone else using it to draw stuff?  No, I'm using it.  My wife's using hers to draw stuff to you.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Big draw something buddies over there. 
[00:23:00]  Yes, Lisa's on the draw something.  Very good.  Draw something sounds terrible.  Oh, it's not terrible.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's Pictionary.  There are some times I look at it and she's having a ton of fun and then there's other  times I'm like, I think I'd get sick of it pretty quick.  Like, I got sick of words with friends.  Like, I still love chess and scramble I play, but I get sick of words with friends even.  I get tired of it.  Oh, I'll get sick of this really quickly.  I'm not saying this is an amazing fucking, wow, this is like Half-Life was when I first  fucking booted it up.  I never knew I could draw.  I don't understand why we keep going backwards. 
[00:23:30]  I know.  Now we're doing incredibly simple gaming again.  Simple games.  Which we did 20 years ago.  Yeah.  And those amazing graphic intensive games are just kind of like, eh.  Yeah, let's go back to basic shit again.  I need phase, I don't know, phase 18 of gaming where it just becomes fully immersive with  the threat of actually getting hit with a bullet when you get shot in those games.  Speaking of gaming, maybe someone can help me out. 
[00:24:00]  Is this Tiger Woods game going to be worth getting this year?  Oh, no.  Another one.  Oh, Travis would know.  Another one?  Travis, is it worth getting?  I have no idea.  Because we talk about this every year about this time.  They don't change up the game enough graphically to justify buying the new version.  What's the point of this version?  To come in 40th in the tournament?  That's the goal.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they made him really small last year, didn't they?  He was small.  They're kind of phasing him out.  They're just making it like Tiger Woods golf.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  He was way in the distance on the cover last year.  Yeah.  He wasn't even on the cover last year.  I heard he was a little guy, no?  What is it?  EA Sports.  A little guy in the background.  He was the Masters.  The Masters.  Oh.  Was it the year before he was the little guy?  The year before, I think he shared the cover.  Any years?  Yeah, I don't know.  I haven't read anything about this year, but I doubt the graphics are going to be any better.  Forget it, man.  Why do they keep not changing the graphics?  I guess because golf guys aren't young.  I mean, there's only so much you can do graphically with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation. 
[00:25:00]  So, like, next year or the year after, when new consoles are out, maybe, you know, they'll be absolutely incredible.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, he is little.  It is Masters, but he's little.  It's not his whole fucking...  He's little.  He was huge on those boxes.  Yeah, his forearm was all big and shit.  It's his back.  Put his face on him.  It's him driving home.  What about Hot Shots?  I got a tweet the other day.  Someone was telling me about Hot Shots.  It's going to be available on the iPad 3 or something?  Because that's a great golf game. 
[00:25:30]  I always loved that one.  Hot Shots.  Could be.  Hot Shots was great.  Was he sharing the cover with Rory this year?  That's not good.  No, it's not good.  Rory's not number one anymore.  He's not?  No.  What's his name?  Does Tiger still stink?  The guy.  Oh, yeah.  He's a little better this year, but he's not winning anything.  His career and life were ruined by that.  Oh, man.  Just amazing, man.  It took him...  I'm telling you, that ritualistic fucking behavior, it took him out of his game, man.  It just ruined him.  When was the last time he won at this point?  I lost track.  Years.  Jeez.  What?  Three years, maybe? 
[00:26:00]  He hasn't won a tournament in three years?  Well, I don't know.  It's a...  Okay.  Certainly a...  Two years, maybe.  Let's say.  Certainly a major in probably three years.  It's a long time.  He hasn't won a tournament in over two years?  I would say two years.  So he won't break Nicholas's record, right?  Well, I mean, he's...  It was almost a guarantee at this point.  It's going to be pretty damn tough.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's got some time, but it doesn't...  2008 was his last major.  2008?  That's four years ago.  U.S. Open.  Was he winning majors every year, right?  No, no.  He was winning one every year. 
[00:26:30]  He was pretty much, yeah.  Good for one.  A couple years, I think he won two, right?  Yeah.  Who's the big guy now?  Rory McIlroy.  It's all over the place, but Rory McIlroy was number one in the world.  Rory McIlroy.  How old is Tiger?  He's pushing 35, maybe, at this point.  36, yeah.  How many years can he play before he's fucking up?  I mean, these guys play up mid-40s competitively easily.  Golf is one of these sports you could play...  Like Phil Mickelson's, what, 40, 41 now?  I hate him.  He just chokes.  How do you not like Phil?  Why don't you like Phil? 
[00:27:00]  He's a fan favorite.  I have this thing, this arthritis that...  Oh, it's commercial for that arthritis.  He does have a weird arthritis thing.  I have this thing.  Right?  Jesus.  No, it made me laugh all night.  Ted Knight.  Oh, God.  I was looking up Ted Knight clips.  What was it, Lou?  There's one clip of him, Mary Tyler Moore's having a terrible party, and he's at the party,  and it was just a dud.  He goes, Mary, your party is dying.  Dying.  Dying, Mary. 
[00:27:30]  Your party is dying.  It was just a dumb delivery.  Because her party's always stunk.  Made it funny every time.  Fucking Ted Knight, man.  They blew it with bosom bodies.  The more I thought about it.  Making him a little too normal and a little too serious.  He was like the straight man for Monroe.  Yeah.  Please.  Oh, I hope Jim J. Bullock's name comes up and draws something.  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  That'll be an easy one.  Blah.  How do you draw blah.  Take out the eye. 
[00:28:00]  Jim J.  Yes.  You can't draw cocks fast enough.  Oh, man.  And that's crazy.  Crazy cocks being drawn.  Fucking Tebow.  Big headline today.  Wow, that John Elway's a cunt.  Yeah, huh?  Holy fuck.  Because all those games.  He found a great out.  Huh?  He found a great out.  But we don't even know if Peyton Manning can fucking play anymore.  Yeah, but no one in Denver.  He hasn't thrown a pass in the NFL in 15 months, does Peyton Manning.  Yeah, but in Denver, that fucking arm.  Are you kidding me?  He'll want to throw the ball into the parking lot.  Yeah, with the thin air.  No fan in Denver can say, I'd rather have Tim Tebow than Peyton Manning. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, but you don't know what Peyton Manning can do.  I would agree on paper.  Yeah, but you know what Tim Tebow can do, and it's not that much.  But there was Elway fucking jumping up and down as Tim Tebow's marching down the field  doing those miraculous victories, and now it turns out Elway was all...  Tebow getting ass in seats, though.  Getting the S's in the seats, though.  Peyton Manning will sell that.  Well, Peyton Manning will fucking get the S's in the seat.  I have to say, like, he threw for them privately, and I've got to assume that if they're offering  him five years, $95 million, they saw something they liked.  Wow, look at Travis with some knowledge. 
[00:29:00]  Is that what he's making the other place?  No, no.  He was...  So, obviously, they obviously saw something.  Sure, yeah.  I mean, he threw for them last week.  They just weren't going to assume that the guy could throw.  No, you'd be stupid to give him a contract without seeing him throw, but he threw for  them in North Carolina on Friday, I think.  Right.  And they liked it.  Florentino has some thoughts.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Is he around?  Why would Tebow...  He's coming in.  Yeah, he's in at 724.  He's in today?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That's perfect.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[00:29:30]  I wonder how he feels about this.  I tweeted that Tebow's officially not a virgin anymore after the fucking, the Broncos in  L.A. gave him.  Yeah, that was some premarital.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It's crazy how fast things go.  Like, the Super Bowl, he's, you know, the talk of the town, and everybody wants a piece  of him.  And now he's probably a guy looking for a job.  Exactly.  Go hang out with Rick Santorum.  Oh, yeah.  They both talk about pornography and how awful obscenity laws are.  What's the rumor with Jacksonville with Tebow, though? 
[00:30:00]  A lot of people think he'll go to Jacksonville because they have a new owner.  He really wants to bring somebody in there.  He played in Jacksonville in college.  Yeah, no kidding.  He's loved...  I mean, he can go to Jacksonville and do no wrong.  I hope he goes to Dallas just to humiliate Tony Romo.  I don't know if he has any...  Where else could he go?  People think he's going to go to, like, New England and be Brady's backup, but they've  already got two backups.  Hell no.  No.  Hell no.  How about Miami?  He could go to Miami.  He could go to Miami.  He could...  I think it'll either be Miami or Jacksonville.  Oh. 
[00:30:30]  That'd be good for him because Florida loves the Tebow.  They do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  That's where he played college.  He was a gator.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Appropriate.  Gator country.  It'd be perfect.  But fuck, man.  Broncos.  Peyton Manning.  That's...  That'd be huge for them.  I think.  And I don't know nothing.  It's better than what they have now.  It's the big story in football.  Where's Peyton going?  All those poor people who bought their Tim Tebow jerseys. 
[00:31:00]  I really...  Lynn Sanity jerseys, too.  They could just sit there and...  Look at this.  Really fast.  Oh, yeah.  They just dropped the puck and started brawling.  Fucking Devil's Rangers went old school last night.  Three seconds into the game, everyone just dropped their gloves.  There were three individual fights at the same time.  Was that planned, you think?  Yeah.  Yeah, they always do that.  Why?  Eh, might be a little beef.  Probably something that happened last game.  Yeah, someone said some shit that someone didn't like.  That's great.  But, yeah, not smart to be fighting this late in the season where you could break a hand 
[00:31:30]  or something.  Rangers are in the playoffs.  They don't need to be fighting.  Rangers don't care.  Those guys don't fuck it.  Like, a fight like that doesn't really faze these guys, right?  Just getting punched in the face a few times?  They go back to the bench.  They sit down.  They're like, meh.  They start talking to each other.  Meanwhile, anyone else would be like, I'm going to kick his ass when I see him again.  Maybe that's just me.  When that happened last night, it was trending on Twitter.  People love fucking fighting in hockey.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the only one that's left where you're kind of allowed to do it. 
[00:32:00]  So, that's why they love it.  They just love beating the shit out of each other.  And then both teams cheer at the end of every fight.  They love it.  Do their joys ever get broken?  All that shit.  Broken jaw almost sucked.  Wow.  How do you eat your cereal?  Wow.  Straws forever?  Someone's saying Tiger won a tournament two months ago.  Ah, shit.  What?  Maybe.  What are you saying?  You a jive turkey. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  I think he came close.  I'm going 70s black guy today.  That's perfect.  That's what I'm doing.  I don't want to look like an asshole.  Tiger Woods fucking...  He didn't win two months ago, did he?  Maybe.  I don't know.  You mentioned Linsanity.  You can get all that stuff for 50% off.  Oh, 50% off.  Oh, my God.  They're just trying to clear out their inventory.  Why?  It's not selling anymore?  No, he was good for two weeks.  Two weeks.  Everyone called it, too.  He's not like...  He's settled down.  He's...  Exactly.  He doesn't suck, but he's...  Six points and six turnovers? 
[00:33:00]  He's putting up Jim Norton numbers.  He's averaging 12.5 points and 5.7 assists for the new coach, Mike Woodson.  Oh, he can bite my weenie.  This new coach, that guy coming back was no good for Linsanity.  Linsanity.  You've had it with Linsanity.  Up to fucking here.  That's going to be a...  That's going to be one of those end-of-the-year things when they go...  And remember Linsanity.  The year where Linsanity took over for a couple of weeks. 
[00:33:30]  He's still good.  He's still good.  Well, it doesn't matter, but it's not Linsanity.  Nicks, I think, have won three in a row with the new coach.  He's in the position he should have been right from the start right now.  Just a guy on the team.  They built him up to the fucking, you know...  He was a fucking star player.  It was a whole tsunami thing that happened with him.  Yeah, it was.  People lost their fucking minds, including myself.  And now you're seeing that he's...  Everyone got swept up.  Now you're seeing he's a good point guard.  Yeah, he's okay.  He's good.  He does a nice job.  He does a nice job. 
[00:34:00]  He does a fair job.  He's an acceptable replacement.  Somebody sprains an ankle.  Well, Roland has his four Linsanity shirts just sitting in his closet now.  Where's all the high fives on the subway?  It's fucking great.  The taking of Pelham 123 had fucking a better vibe on the subway than him.  Stupid Linsanity shirts.  Linsanity.  There's a rumor that they're going to keep both Manning and Tebow.  Eric in Colorado.  I don't have time to go to you on the phone, but...  It could happen.  Is that a good rumor? 
[00:34:30]  I don't think so.  All over the place.  Because you better sign him for five years.  You don't really want to be a backup for five years.  Where's Tebow's contract at, though?  I don't know.  But he's obviously signed through next year.  Yeah.  So they'll probably try to trade him and get some money back.  I would think that they would try to trade him, sure.  He wants to be a starter.  So Peyton Manning believes that the Broncos could win a Super Bowl in the next few years, huh?  They could, sure.  I don't know enough about the Broncos.  Is that possible?  They made the playoffs this year.  Yeah, true.  They're not, like, next in line, but they could do it. 
[00:35:00]  Why didn't he go to the 49ers?  I don't know.  I thought he would.  The 49ers.  The 49ers.  Huh?  Steve Young's coming back.  Fuck, Steve Young's coming back.  That's why.  Why would he go there?  I don't know.  I feel like they have a better shot at a Super Bowl.  They're getting a new stadium in, like, two years, and I think it's going to be an indoor  stadium.  So it sounded like it might be a better fit for him.  Yeah, but Peyton Manning's had it with owners building stadiums for him.  I think he likes that.  They built that whole nice place for Peyton Manning, and he's no longer there. 
[00:35:30]  It must be like being a pharaoh.  You go in there, and they just build monuments to you.  Pretty cool, right?  Jesus.  I think it's the atmosphere, to be honest with you.  I think he's got to love being in Denver, because his arm is not what it was, and he  can fucking throw at that altitude.  What is it now, a leg?  Well, yeah.  What he does, he's three-legged McGillicuddy, see?  His arm isn't what he used to be.  It turns into a head.  Yeah, none of his pants fit anymore.  It's so bizarre.  He's got two helmets and shit.  But he'll throw for a lot more yards than that.  Yeah.  Maybe I can see altitude again. 
[00:36:00]  I think he wants to stay in the AFC, so he doesn't have to compete with his brother.  Oh, okay.  Ah.  It's known as a weaker division.  Oh, boy.  And maybe also, because Denver, I heard he loves shoveling snow, and he has an investment  in a rock salt company.  I've been up for two days.  Hey, Tiger won the Chevron World Challenge in December.  Good for him.  What's that?  Exactly.  No one knows what that is.  It is a PGA event.  Big deal.  I won the Sunoco fucking ball-off.  Who cares? 
[00:36:30]  Ball-off?  I think that was in, like, Australia or something.  Chevron.  I would love to see Jimmy sit in on one of those brainstorming meetings when they have  to come up with names for anything.  What do you think?  Ah, the Chevron ball-off.  I'm done here.  Yeah, let's call it the Exxon Pudoroski.  I'm tired.  Pudoroski.  All right.  Later.  Lunch?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It's the fucking mobile mulligan.  All right.  Your turn.  Tomorrow I'll play.  Fucking boo.  Ah, shit. 
[00:37:00]  Technically we were wrong, I guess, but it's not a big fucking PGA event.  No.  No.  Fair enough, though.  Fair enough.  Sure.  Fair enough.  Manning would hate playing with Harbo in San Fran.  All right.  Good.  These are the people that know more about sports than us.  Look, who are we to judge where he goes, right?  Kenny, where are the tissues?  My snout's running.  Okay.  Okay.  I think it's food time.  I sneezed, and I was like, oh, I got some.  Oh, they're right there in front of my fizz. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  They're behind one of the dangerous computer monitors.  Yeah, where's the...  It's not even an official.  Where's the horrible colored suit jacket?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, there it is.  What color is that?  That is the crayon no one uses color.  It's like mauve and baby shit.  Kenny's terrible.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh.  What color is that, Kenny?  Mauve.  Hey, what do you got there, Roland?  What are you wearing?  This suit is from my spring collection.  Turn around.  Let me see. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, he's got...  Buy the hype.  Oh, Roland's still wearing his Jeremy Lin jersey.  Roland bought the hype.  What do we got there?  The movie stunk.  What is it?  The Descendants.  Oh, no.  That was on my plane ride.  Stupid Hawaiian.  Fucking...  It was horrible.  I saw most of it.  I was excited when Roland gave it to me yesterday.  Oh, take my copy and fucking watch it twice.  George Clooney...  Knock yourself out.  He's a bore.  He just wanders around Hawaii and his wife's in a coma. 
[00:38:30]  It's like, what's going on?  Looking for the guy who fucked his wife.  Who gives a turkeys?  Sees him running on the beach.  I watched it.  Put a pillow on that cunt's face and move on.  He cheated on you.  Descendants would be more interesting if it was about a family from Austria.  See what they're up to now.  It really was all...  Mannequins and hijinks.  It was a real horrible year for movies.  Oh, dude.  Because this was nominated, right?  It was terrible.  And whatever happened to that dumb silent movie after it won all those Oscars?  Still, it's still like...  They didn't put it in theaters. 
[00:39:00]  It's in the parish by the Apple Store.  You would think they would throw it in the big theaters after winning Oscars.  They didn't.  It would be the one movie you could go see in like fucking Harlem and not care who's yapping.  Kenny?  Can I make an important comment before you go to break?  Yeah.  I just want to commend you guys on the power of the show because since yesterday, a lot  more people liked me on Facebook.  Thank God.  It's why we're here.  I thought the power of the show meant we figured out the whole Cleveland trip.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  You guys took care of that, too.  No problem.  You guys watched us fucking talk to the bosses properly, right?  Yeah.  Who'd they think they were fucking with?  Oh, yeah.  Were you guys doing live commentary?  Yeah.  Were you giving them the business yesterday outside the studio?  What came in?  Nice.  We were all pondering.  Yeah.  The busy buddy wants to know.  Wait.  First of all, how many likes did he get yesterday on Facebook?  I think I got like over 200.  Damn.  Wow.  Yeah.  A lot of people commenting how terrific I am.  They're smart people. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  The busy buddy comment.  I was still wondering about Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't worry.  I think we might have figured that out.  That's why we bitched, man.  They came forward.  Didn't they, Kenny?  I didn't get to listen to the busy buddy show yesterday because I spent so much time standing  outside this office falling the fuck to sleep.  It really was.  Sam just wants to know if we're going to Cleveland so he can start planning his big prank. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  We want to have, we were talking about this yesterday on, after Sam Roberts punked.  No, we want all the staff to share one hotel room.  Ah.  Well, that sounds actually sexy.  Why do we want to do that?  Because we're pretty sure that Eric will be the first one to fall asleep.  And so we want to wrap him in cellophane on his cot and then wheel him out into the  hallway and send him up the elevator.  Oh, that's boring.  Send him downtown Cleveland with a homeless fucking people.  Be careful what you wish for. 
[00:41:00]  Ah, shit.  All right.  Kenny's eyeballing you.  I don't even know what that means.  I love his sayings and stuff.  Anyone have an iPad charger?  It's one awful saying after another.  Oh, no, this goes into the computer.  I need an iPad charger.  Oh, boy.  Any fans nearby that could lend me their iPad charger?  Sure.  There's one laying about.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm certain of it.  You didn't like our meeting yesterday?  I don't like any meeting at all. 
[00:41:30]  But the one yesterday, it was just like listening, listening, listening.  And then I chime in every so often.  But it's just like, oh, God.  You didn't feel like talking much.  No, I've learned to loathe the meeting.  Are you actually listening?  I always need to know.  You are listening?  I am listening.  All right, good.  I heard all the shit about the whys and hows and whos.  And it just, the thing that was pissing me off was this undertone of, look, we did the right thing. 
[00:42:00]  And no matter what our side was saying, there was still this little undertone of, look, we did this, this, this, everything we were obligated to do.  So a lot of, come on, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  We did that.  And it's like, yeah, you know what?  Well, if you didn't want to sit on the wing of the aircraft, why didn't you just tell us?  Exactly.  There's a man out there.  A man on the wing.  Well, we didn't have to tell you.  The lack of general knowledge just blows me away.  It did seem like it got tense at points. 
[00:42:30]  No.  Not really.  No?  Everyone was hoping we were getting fired, all these hopeful people.  I was more amazed, actually.  I'm just amazed at the lack of knowledge.  By the way, Kenny told me yesterday that he's been telling everybody who asked about what happened to the stickers on the windows when they were all messed up yesterday.  Yeah.  That somebody vandalized the studio over the weekend.  Vandalized the studio.  Yeah.  And they go, in this building?  I go, it's a bad neighborhood.  They go, but it didn't happen on my watch, so don't besmirch my reputation. 
[00:43:00]  Besmirch.  Did we get in trouble for that?  Besmirch your reputation.  Not a peep, right?  Not a peep.  Not a peep ripping that shit down?  No.  Nice.  I like that.  It's hanging in our office.  It's hanging in the office?  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Oh.  Yeah, I missed the whole show yesterday.  It was a good one.  There was a discussion.  Thank God, though.  I was able to hear Ron and Fez.  There was a discussion that our obligation when we're in Cleveland would be over after the radio show on Friday.  But we're there for Jim Norton. 
[00:43:30]  Theoretic.  I mean, the word obligation.  I had explained to him that we're always doing the radio show.  Uh-huh.  So the obligation would not be over because we'd be going to dinner.  We'd be checking out Jimmy backstage and in the audience.  And all this stuff would lead to a nice discussion on Monday.  Right.  So how is the obligation over after the radio show on Friday?  Yeah, exactly.  How is that possible?  They agreed to pay for one-eighth of my effort.  I have to.  But I can't carry on luggage, and they're going to put tape down the middle of my seat. 
[00:44:00]  I have to share it.  Well, they should.  I was referencing Jimmy as this kid, and then finally Jimmy goes to me.  I'm 44 years old.  Yeah, yeah.  I said 43.  43.  Oh, that's so fucking funny.  43.  They need to have the proper perspective on this program because I don't think they appreciate what's going on here.  Yes, and to hear Opie calling Jimmy a kid in the hallway was hilarious.  Because I kept sitting there.  Because I kept saying, I go, you know what this kid has done for the show and this company? 
[00:44:30]  This kid's done a lot.  And I looked over and I went, kid?  I liked it.  Did you?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's cute.  You liked it the first seven times, and then you finally said, look, I'm 43 years old.  I'm like, oh, God, Jesus.  I was like, what am I going to something?  All places cracking up.  Jimmy promotes the Opie and Anthony show starring Jim Norton and the company wherever he goes.  Yeah.  So he's getting in local papers, local TV, local radio stations, and all these markets.  He is selling subscriptions. 
[00:45:00]  He sells.  All over the place.  He sells.  And there's big Jim Norton news.  Yeah.  TV appearance tomorrow.  Damn it.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Jim Norton sells.  I could say, give me anything.  I'll sell it.  Give me a fucking toy solar system, kid.  I'll sell the fucking thing.  I'll sell two.  Jesus.  Michelle Obama's got a big ass.  And it's taken up a lot of couch on Letterman, huh?  And how about...  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  Why are her kids in Mexico on spring break with 25 secret service agents?  Like, there's a travel advisory for Americans. 
[00:45:30]  I talk about how much we're in the hole financially.  And to go on spring break, we've got to give these two fucking...  This kid 25 secret service agents?  Yeah.  The fuck is that?  It's Mexico.  They should let Sirius do their budget.  Imagine that, Mr. President.  You're going to have to pay for the security for your daughter.  We'll let your daughters...  We'll pay for them to get to the Rose Garden of the White House.  After that, they're on their own.  Do you know the Mexican drug cartels how they would love to have that trophy? 
[00:46:00]  That's exactly why.  The amount of money that they would want for kidnapping.  They wouldn't...  How about she doesn't go to fucking Mexico?  It's terrible.  It's a callous, stupid place to go.  This must be like one of those arranged marriage things between countries in the old days.  They're like, all right, she goes to Mexico.  Mexico does something for us.  Well, they figure it's good for their tourism.  But again, it's costing us a lot of money.  Unless Mexico is paying for those secret service agents, because for them it looks good.  Yeah.  More importantly, is Michelle Obama sitting on an inner tube? 
[00:46:30]  A green inner tube?  Big man, right?  What is she sitting on?  Her face looks thinner, though.  She got some ass on her.  She can't get that ass down.  She got some ass on her.  Looks like Obama likes a big old way.  God damn.  May.  May.  Yeah, like Obama actually takes care of that dog.  Come on.  Who are you kidding?  There's a whole staff that takes care of the White House dog.  It's a beautiful dog.  Is it hypoallergenic?  I want to kiss it.  It looks like a hypoallergenic. 
[00:47:00]  That's a fun-looking dog.  It's got a fro.  Yeah, I like it.  It's cool.  I would get one of those.  Yeah.  I'll let him jump in my lap and I'd fucking kiss his head.  Pet it.  Why doesn't he get a shitty dog?  They really do.  Dogs love Jimmy.  He would help the shitty dogs if he had a shitty dog.  Instead of one of these fucking designer dogs.  Yeah.  Is that a labradoodle?  No, I don't think so.  It's sort of in that genre.  I want a labradoodle.  Yeah, those are kind of cool.  Just so I can kick it.  People go, why are you kicking that labradoodle?  Labradoodle.  I can say his name bugs me. 
[00:47:30]  Why are you kicking the cutest dog in the world?  Yeah, his name bugs me, man.  Shit.  Are we ready to go to break and eat and start?  Ah, got to eat.  I see Florentine outside the studio.  We're going to ask him about the Peyton Manning thing.  Why?  Florentine knows football.  Yeah.  He sure does.  It's a problem.  You think he's going to say it's a problem?  Why is he doing that?  He's great.  We'll find out next.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:48:00]  It's great.  I like to have those guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night on the show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  How to show their news.  How to show their news.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  On Sirius XM.  Coming up on the next Butt Trek, the USS Prolapse continues its journey through the universe 
[00:48:30]  in search of giant cocks to fuck.  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh, my.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  They must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form.  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy. 
[00:49:00]  Cocks.  And struggle with the dangers of traveling through the universe.  Don't tell me.  There's a germinal suck in my hiding.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where did your cock go?  Discover the fate of our fearless heroes all on the next Butt Trek.  Power of the ships, Captain.  I'd like a dick in my backside.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts 
[00:49:30]  and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get.  Musical icon and living legend, Elton John.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Sir Elton John.  Sir Elton, how are you with electronics?  With electronics?  Yes.  Hopeless.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts 
[00:50:00]  and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  You know it ain't easy.  You know how hard it can be.  The way things are going.  All right.  You're going to crucify me.  Is this, um...  What's the line in?  Vladimir? 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  How are you?  You inspired me to do a Get Clued tweet last night.  Yes, you did.  You were my inspiration.  Did you appreciate that?  I found it funny, yes.  I wanted to say, uh, you're a mom,  and then I, I, I wasn't on the radio,  so I felt like I can't do that. 
[00:51:00]  No, that would have been inappropriate.  Ah.  My tweet, because everyone's on,  onto this Get Glue shit, Ant.  So my Get Glue tweet last night was,  I'm having sex with your mom.  457 others checked in.  Get glue.  Get glue.  Because I don't get that Get Glue shit either.  Get glue.  People are, what, the wrestling people are using Get Glue now,  and, and, and you and, um, uh, Sam there are, are pissed?  Why?  Well, we're, we're not pissed.  It's just, it was a weird coincidence that, you know, 
[00:51:30]  we've been talking about this for a long time now,  and now all of a sudden other social media aspects are,  are jumping in on the whole Get Glue thing.  The biggest one being WWE.  So you ripped, uh, they ripped you off,  is what you're saying.  I think.  Who, who, who, who, who.  Because Sam collects all the, uh,  all the programming stickers right off there.  Of course he does.  Now all of a sudden they're advertising that,  hey, you should try Get Glue.  I got my Zack Ryder sticker last night.  You know it.  Woo, woo, woo.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Is that necessary?  Are we getting old finally?  I know we're old, but I mean, like, 
[00:52:00]  our brains were pretty young still.  Are we finally getting old throughout our entire bodies?  If it was 20 years ago,  I wouldn't be collecting fucking stickers, okay?  Because I, I don't get the Get Glue sticker thing.  You know who loves stickers?  Kids.  My little fucking nephew.  How about my almost two-year-old loves stickers?  I love stickers.  I can't get enough of the stickers,  not fucking grown men.  There it is.  Who cares?  You guys are like,  what stickers are, let me see it.  And it's not even a good sticker,  because part of it's bent over.  Well, it won't be bent. 
[00:52:30]  What the fuck are you doing?  It's a terrible sticker.  What, they have to do that to show you that it's a sticker?  That's a sticker.  Or does it come that way?  No, no, it can be bent over when it comes.  They show it, yeah, like a little fucking dog-eared.  Yeah, that's dumb.  To show you can peel it right off.  Of course.  How do you get them?  Don't, don't, don't ask.  You check in to say,  I'm watching Ross.  Oh, the fucking...  The Get Glue thing.  And if you check in while it's live,  you'll get the sticker of the week.  I also get Celebrity Apprentice stickers.  There should be a target that you put on your forehead. 
[00:53:00]  Horrible.  Oh, yeah, getting topical with the sex man there.  Sex man.  So what happened?  There's a Lennon song there.  That's the one Paul McCartney sings with him on that one, too.  Which song is that?  No.  He's in there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's impossible.  Yeah, he's in there.  They hated each other.  Oh, he's in there.  That's the Beatles.  Oh, I know, but he's in there.  He's in there.  He's in there.  Nope.  He's in there.  He's in there.  Oh, I never knew that.  He's in there.  For real?  Yeah, you could hear him doing the high-five harmony.  So why didn't they make it a Beatles song?  It was kind of cool for them to just hook up and fucking do a little high-harmony in there. 
[00:53:30]  But they could have released it as the latest Beatles song, even though we're broken up.  Well, there wasn't any George or Paul in there.  Who were those guys?  Exactly.  George every once in a while, certainly, but not...  George.  What would Rolvi say?  Rolvi.  All right, what's the Lennon news there, Iraq?  We've got to move on, because the great Florentine is in studio.  It's not important.  Just let's move on.  It's your bit.  Make it good.  John and Yoko married 43 years ago. 
[00:54:00]  That's significant.  I was going to play Tears in Heaven, because Clapton's kid died, but I thought that'd be a little depressing.  How did it happen?  His son would have been 25 years old.  That's how long ago that happened.  It's crazy.  That's fucking...  I was working with Phil Selman that weekend, and...  Oh, with Clapton's kid?  Yeah, and there was a picture.  There was Arbidjons in East Brunswick, and there was a fucking...  Remember the fucking city scope on the wall?  At the back wall, the picture of the Manhattan.  Oh, no.  And fucking Phil Selman pointed at the window, and he says, 
[00:54:30]  that's the window that Clapton's kid fell out of.  Oh, my God.  It got a zero.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  Wow.  It got a zero from the...  I howled.  You gotta give him an A for effort, but...  Oh, he didn't care.  Florentine.  That was a very mean joke.  Florentine.  I like your little boy haircut.  I saw it at the moment.  I know.  You said that outside the studio.  No one else heard it except for me and you.  Demand hair.  You felt like it would work on the air as well, huh? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I can't glow my hair like you anymore.  I got some shit happening up here now.  Got some shit.  Some shit.  The start of a triangle thing.  All right.  All right.  Little shit.  And when it grows, it gets heavy, and then you can see, oh, fuck, there's some shit going on.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  A little less up there these days.  It happens.  What are you going to do?  Florentine, what do you think of the whole Peyton Manning thing?  Well, look, the contract's still not even signed yet. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, it's happening, though.  Yeah, it's been almost 24 hours.  First of all, he's the new Brett Favre, Peyton Manning.  He's a fucking diva, is what he is.  Really?  Yeah, he held like seven teams hostage until they finally signed with Denver yesterday, supposedly,  and he still hasn't even signed yet.  Yeah, but they've got a gentleman's agreement.  They still kind of have that in sports.  You never know.  No?  What's going to happen there?  It's still not until a contract's signed, he can walk away from it.  Is it a good move?  It's good for Denver, yeah.  I mean, but, you know, Elway's a piece of shit.  Elway's, you know, oh, Tim Tebow's my guy. 
[00:56:00]  He's starting next season.  Why wouldn't he be?  He actually did say that.  He took us to the playoffs, absolutely.  That's exactly what he said.  He said he earned the right to start next year.  That's right.  Yeah, and this was after the season when they knew Manning was going to get released,  when they already thought as soon as he gets released, we're going after him.  So that was in the back of the mind.  And they say, hey, we'll see what happens in training camp.  And Elway was jumping up and down, biggest cheerleader, when Tebow was marching up the field.  Ah, we haven't seen Elway's face in 20 years.  Right.  All of a sudden, Tebow's doing good.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  He hasn't aged well.  They're calling him Judas in Denver. 
[00:56:30]  A lot of people are fucking pissed off at Elway.  Yeah, because he totally lied.  And why would Manning go to an organization like that when he just said, oh, Tebow's our guy,  so he's a scumbag.  Where should he, where should have, he went, do you think?  I don't know.  What was the best fit for Pete Manning?  He fucked up, he fucked up so many teams by, you know, his agent throwing out the, look,  first of all, look at what happened with the Jets.  So the Jets just make a call, hey, is Peyton interested?  And of course, his agent leaks that, so he makes this big thing, so everybody's going 
[00:57:00]  to be bidding for him.  And then the Jets got to go, oh, we didn't really mean it, and give Sanchez a fucking extension  when they don't even want that guy on the team.  They had to, because he hurt his feelings.  Oh, really?  Yeah, of course.  You think, well, why, they didn't even want Sanchez there, but they had no choice, because  Sanchez found out they were looking for Peyton, because Peyton's agent.  Right.  And then he's just, you know, working every team, or working the Dolphins, working the  Cardinals, working Tennessee, working San Francisco, Denver.  So every team has to wait for their free agency to start to see if they're going to sign  this fucking asshole.  So they can't sign anybody else, because they need the cap space. 
[00:57:30]  So he held up everybody for two weeks, basically.  I have a feeling you don't like Peyton Manning.  Well, he's going to be the next Brett Favre, because he's going to be a diva, because now  he's going to go to a team where, basically, he was on the Colts for all those years, and  he had two coaches, with Dungy and Caldwell, two mild-mannered black men that didn't say  a word, and he just did whatever he wanted.  He just ran his own offense.  He called his own plays, and he just said, fuck you.  I'm doing it my way, and they just let him do it.  Now he's going to go here, and they're not going to let him do that, and that's when it's  going to be a problem.  Really? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Pretty interesting to watch.  It's going to be the new Brett Favre, because remember when Favre went to Minnesota?  He had the problem with Childress there, because he just said, I'm not coming out of a game.  I'm staying in.  I don't care.  I'm Brett Favre.  I'm just going to throw fucking long passes.  You're just staying in the game?  Yeah.  Childress told him to come out of a game when they were down like 24-0.  Right.  Yeah.  It was the second to last game of the season.  And he said no?  He said no, I'm not coming out.  And he stayed in.  I didn't know.  Oh, yeah.  But he's a team player.  Yeah, of course he is.  That's Brett being Brett.  Right.  Come on.  He's a competitor.  Meanwhile, anybody else, imagine if fucking Calvin Pace on the Jets, imagine if Rex Ryan 
[00:58:30]  goes, get off the field.  He goes, no, I'm staying out here.  Oh, no.  That would never happen.  But would they say he's a competitor?  No, of course not.  Anyone else is a fucking asshole that won't go off the field.  Right.  You don't think that was just Brett being Brett?  Yeah, Brett.  That was Brett being Brett.  Man, just be the competitor.  No, he's a fucking scumbag.  Brett Favre just ruined his legacy.  And that's what's going to happen to Peyton Manning, too.  Yeah.  You think he could still play?  They must have saw something like Travis was saying.  And obviously, they had some kind of work out with the guy.  Look, they're going to take a chance, even if the guy's 75% of what he was. 
[00:59:00]  They're going to give him $95 million over five years.  Yeah, but that's going to be all backloaded.  It's going to be two years he'll get, like, you know, $22 or $24 million.  And then the rest will be backloaded.  They can cut him after two years.  That's what the contract's going to be.  Right.  So it's not going to really be $95.  The guy's made enough money in his career.  But he's still holding a franchise for more money.  And you think Tebow sucks that much?  No.  He's unconventional, obviously.  But, man, they just didn't believe in him.  Oh, yeah.  They totally screwed him.  I don't know where he's going to go now.  Jacksonville, they're saying, right?  No, they already signed Chad Henney, Miami's backup there. 
[00:59:30]  So he's the backup in Jacksonville.  So they're not going to have three quarterbacks there.  They got that Blaine Gabbert guy that they drafted.  So why is everyone saying Jacksonville?  Because they're idiots.  Because they don't fucking know.  They just call it Jacksonville because he played down there.  They signed Chad Henney for $4 million to backup Blaine Gabbert,  who they drafted in the first round last year.  So he's not going there.  He knows football.  I'm so lost.  I'm nodding a lot, but I'm lost.  No, but you know what the best part about, and you guys can relate to this with sports,  when a guy's a free agent, right?  This is what everyone says.  Well, you know, he's going to go to the Dolphins because he's got a condo in South Beach. 
[01:00:00]  And then he's going to go to Tennessee because he went to school there.  And his wife's family's from there.  Who gives a fuck?  That's why they don't go there.  You think he wants to hang out with his wife's family?  Everyone.  Well, he's got a fucking retarded cousin in San Francisco, so he might go to the 49ers.  That never works because no one wants to be around their family or friends.  Because all they want is fucking free tickets. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, Peyton Manning's wife's family's going,  Hey, Peyton, I'm at the game.  My plumber.  Can you come to the 50-yard line?  He wants to meet you.  Fuck you.  Hey, what do I do when I get to the stadium?  He's texting Peyton.  Do I get the...  What do I do?  Your priority parking?  Could you hook me up?  Oh, man.  Yeah, where's Will Call?  What do I do?  Do I show my...  What the fuck?  I don't know.  You tell me.  Have you ever gone to a Metallica concert?  What do you do?  You get in touch with James Hetfield?  Hey, James, what do I do when I get to the show? 
[01:01:00]  And where do I go when I walk in, you fucks?  You fucks.  All of a sudden, if you know somebody, then you don't know what it's that.  You have no idea what you're going to do.  Yeah.  What road should I take to the Metal Lands?  Fucking assholes.  You know somebody.  You don't have to know anything.  You don't have to know anything.  Right, right.  But if you don't know Billy Joel, somehow you get to the concert,  and you sit in your seats, and you drive home.  You somehow figure it out.  Yeah.  God damn.  That's why those guys never go.  Whenever someone says, oh, no, his family's from here, 
[01:01:30]  he's definitely not going there.  You're fucking brilliant.  You think these guys get a lot of text messages on a day of the game?  Peyton Manning's probably on the field fucking warming up.  He got to tell you, my plumber just wants to meet you.  What's going on after the game?  Nothing.  Nothing.  We just got blown out 37-nothing.  Nothing's going on after the game.  Go home to your family.  No party.  No fucking.  Right.  Can we get in the locker room?  Why?  You want to look at big black mules?  Why do you want to go in the locker room after the game?  Call my buddy, you know, you fucking, you know, be able to shake your hand.  Yeah, you know.  He says you're an everyday guy. 
[01:02:00]  Just, can you at least come out in the park lot and say hi?  He just threw five interceptions.  You're hanging me out to dry here.  I fucking, you know, told this guy.  Yeah, I appreciate you hooking us up, but where do we go after the game?  Are you ready?  Because you got him fired up out there.  Fuck, the one guy hung up.  Line them all up.  Bring them in the studio.  Don't fucking hang up.  We had a great call and he fucking hung up.  We'll go to Kyle in Boston first.  Kyle.  Okay.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, man?  We got Florentine in the studio.  Florentine, big fan, man. 
[01:02:30]  Thanks.  I just kicked on an hour of sports radio yesterday on my drive home to see what they were talking  about out here.  Yeah.  The entire time, all they talked about was how fucking Tim Tebow is going to fit in in the  Patriots with McDaniels next year.  It's possible.  I mean, you know, because Belichick will do that kind of stuff, but then you got to take Brady  off the field to put Tebow in for a play.  And so you really want to keep, you know, the basically, you know, probably the best  quarterback in football, take them off to have Tebow run a fucking goofy play.  You know what I mean?  Like, you play at that fucking, you know, your peewee team. 
[01:03:00]  I was going to say, one of those plays we used to draw up in the streets, right?  What are you going to draw up in the dirt?  Run out to the Chevron.  So I'd say he's probably not going to go there.  Yeah, let's look where that guy's standing.  Let's go that way.  He's probably going to move before the ball's snapped, asshole.  You don't think, oh, you're saying it's a possibility for the Patriots.  No, he's not going to go there.  Because Belichick's not going to take Brady off the field for a play to do that.  You only do that when you've got a shitty quarterback.  That's what Miami did for years because they had a shitty quarterback. 
[01:03:30]  So they put, you know, Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams in those formations.  Yeah, but you fuck up the defense a little bit.  Everybody's figured that shit out.  You think?  Yeah, Tebow's a white guy.  They're going to catch him.  They're already on to him.  They already figured him out.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Jersey.  Dennis.  Hey.  Hey.  Sporting, big fan, man.  Listen.  Two things.  Number one, the Denver Broncos have already told Peyton Manning that he has full control  of the offense because last year, remember, they used two offenses.  They used the pro offense. 
[01:04:00]  And in the second half of the season, they used the Tim Tebow watered-down college offense.  Right.  Yeah, well, that's the problem.  That's when it's going to come in.  That's when the Brett Favre shit's going to happen with Manning, when he starts throwing  interceptions because his arm might not be 100% back, and they're going to tell him  to scale back the offense.  He's going to go, no, I call my own plays.  That's when you're going to see his legacy get hurt.  The diva.  Yeah.  The diva comes out.  Here's the only thing.  They even say, again, nobody's going to want Tebow because of all the hoopla around him. 
[01:04:30]  Like, if you bring him in, like, it's a three-ring circus that comes in with him.  He sells tickets, though.  People who aren't selling tickets maybe would bring him in.  He sells a lot of tickets.  If you've got a team that doesn't have a prayer of making the Super Bowl, then you  bring a guy in like that just to get the hype up.  Fucking Cleveland Browns.  Like Jacksonville, who has to put tarps on the third deck of their stadium because they  can't sell tickets.  Really?  He's a god there.  Oh, that's right.  He might go to Jacksonville because he went to college there.  Yeah, well, yeah, and he's got a cousin that lives right outside of Jacksonville.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Tim.  Yeah, how you doing, man? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I want to take my family to the game, but no seats available.  Florida.  Is there a way you could, yeah.  Florida would love to have them, though.  You know, unless they get rid of one of those quarterbacks in Jacksonville, maybe they sign  Henny or something like that.  I mean, that's a good spot for them because Jacksonville, they only sell like 40,000 tickets  and they've got 80,000 seats in that stadium.  Because it's tough to go to a sporting event when it's beautiful out.  Well, when your team blows, too.  Yeah, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami don't sell out.  Yeah, but some of those teams down there didn't blow and they still couldn't get people in  the seats.  Yeah, because nobody lives down. 
[01:05:30]  Nobody's from Florida that lives in Florida, so they're not going to all of a sudden be a Jacksonville  fan.  Is that what that's about?  People from New York that moved to Tampa or Miami aren't going to start liking the Bucs  or the Dolphins.  I thought the Dolphins sold out, though, no?  No, they haven't in like the last three years.  Oh, wow.  Wow, really?  They didn't sell out either, yeah.  How short are they from the sellout?  Like 10,000.  10,000?  The owner buys them up and they show the games on TV, yeah.  Wow, shit.  He has to buy up 10,000 tickets every week?  They got that other shit down there.  They got LeBron down there and the Marlins and stuff.  There's too much shit to do in Miami.  They don't care.  Marlins?  Nightlife.  Marlins don't draw. 
[01:06:00]  They will with the new stadium now.  Yeah?  Why?  Yeah.  Okay, it's new and shiny.  They're going to have air conditioning?  Yeah, it's a dome, actually.  Nice.  They're going to put it, yeah.  Keep it nice and cool there?  Was it just too hot in the other one?  Fuck you.  Yeah, and it was a football stadium.  It was bad.  You're outside in the middle of summer in Florida when you could be at a beach on a jet ski.  Didn't the A's used to play in fucking the Raiders?  Who was playing where the Raiders played?  What do you mean?  Or was it when the Raiders were in an Olympics? 
[01:06:30]  There was some weird thing that the Raiders were doing.  The L.A. Coliseum, was it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who played there?  Oh, yeah.  Did they move the Raiders there for a little while?  I don't remember.  I'm thinking.  Wasn't that the stadium for the Rams back in the day?  Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.  The L.A. Rams.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Joe.  He's calling back.  He thinks you're wrong about everything, Florentine.  Well, good.  Joe, what do you got?  John.  All right, John, what's up?  Well, first of all, Peyton only held any team hostage for about a week until he came out.  No, two weeks.  Two weeks.  He got cut two weeks ago. 
[01:07:00]  It was 14 days.  Yeah, but he wasn't holding anyone hostage.  He pretty much came out right away and said, dude, they're going to be Denver, Titans, or the Niners.  No, he didn't.  He met with the Dolphins.  He met with the Cardinals.  The Chiefs called.  The Jets called.  You're wrong.  He met with the Cardinals, and it said right away, after he met with the Cardinals, forget it.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  He didn't get...  He waited like four days with the Cardinals.  He met with the Dolphins.  He didn't give them an answer for another week.  He held everybody up, and nobody can go out and get Mario Williams or any other big free agents  because that fuck was just like, oh, let me sit back and wait. 
[01:07:30]  Make a decision, asshole.  He was never serious with the Dolphins.  How do you know?  Why would he meet with them then?  Then why didn't he meet with the fucking Seahawks then?  He wasn't serious with them either.  Why did he spend six hours of his life meeting with the Dolphins?  He didn't meet with the Seahawks.  I know, exactly, because he wasn't interested.  He met with the Dolphins.  Yeah, and then right away, he found out that, you know, that wasn't going to work.  No, he didn't.  He didn't find out right away.  They waited like four or five days on him.  Matt Flynn was out there.  Miami could have signed, but they had to wait for this fucking asshole. 
[01:08:00]  And the other thing is, he's not going to be a diva there because they're going to install  his offense.  Not only that, they're talking about bringing in all these guys from the Colts that are not  free agents.  It's going to be like the Colts 2.0 over here.  They're bringing in Dallas Clubs, Jeff Saturday.  What did you say?  The Colts 2.0.  All right, first of all, Reggie, he fucked Reggie Wayne because Reggie Wayne was a free agent,  a wide receiver for the Colts.  Great, right?  He was out there.  So Peyton Manning fucking is holding all these teams hostage.  He's like, look, I got to sign a contract or I'm going to be, if I wait two weeks, I'm 
[01:08:30]  going to get a million dollars for one year.  And the Colts offer him like 20 for four years.  I got to take this money now while it's on the table.  So he had to stay with a shitty team.  So he fucked his friend over right there.  Now you go.  Well, watch where Dallas Clark goes.  Watch where Joseph and I go.  Nobody wants Dallas Clark.  The guy's played four games in the last three years.  I think the Broncos are going to want him.  Watch.  Yeah, well, yeah, of course.  Nobody else wanted him because the guy's always hurt.  So he's not going to...  So let the Broncos take him.  They'll play fucking three games. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, and he'll get 12 touchdowns.  Yeah, okay, yeah.  So he's going to catch four a game.  Okay, great.  Well, that's who Manning looks for, so...  Yeah, Jeff Saturday could have got more money.  The guy's 36 years old.  Nobody wants him.  Good.  He's going to have his center and his tight end there.  Ooh.  Wow.  Yeah, it's the Colts 2-0.  And his running back.  Who?  He's going to bring in his guy, too.  Oh, ooh.  Wow.  That's fucking crazy.  You're going to do sports radio. 
[01:09:30]  I would listen to this every day.  Every day.  When you win the AFC West, it's going to be fine.  Yeah, well, you've got to fucking...  Yeah, of course you're going to win the AFC West.  You've got to...  It's a shit fucking division.  Yeah, you've got to...  Look, he's going to win some games for it.  They're going to go 10-6.  They're going to win the division.  They'll be out the first round.  And that's what's going to happen.  Winning games in the playoffs is what it's about.  And you have a chance at the Super Bowl.  Well, Tebow did that.  Look, he's not going to bomb there.  I'm not saying he's going to bomb there.  But he's going to be exposed for being a diva.  And when he starts throwing picks and fucking Denver wants to scale an offense back, 
[01:10:00]  that's when he's going to show.  And he's going to go, I'm going to...  I try to change the play at the line.  Stop with that, you fuck.  He stands there for 30 seconds.  Points at everybody.  Everybody's on to you, motherfucker.  Okay, you stats have been down for the last four years.  You threw a big pick in the fucking Super Bowl and lost the Super Bowl for the Colts.  And then your last game you played, Sanchez, a second-year quarterback,  fucking beat you on your own turf.  Okay?  Your career's going downhill and stopped trying to change plays.  Where's this hate coming from for Peyton? 
[01:10:30]  Nowhere.  I kind of like the guy.  Oh, okay.  I kind of like the guy.  Hey, what about...  What was the Super Bowl pick?  I just...  Favre's gone, so I got nobody to hate.  So now I'm on the Manning.  What was the Super Bowl pick?  I don't know that.  That pick interception he threw against...  No, the Saints.  Well, the Saints, the St. Colts Super Bowl, he had a big pick thrown and he lost a game  for it.  He took it back for a touchdown.  And obviously the Jets took him out of the playoffs.  And that was the last game he played.  Which is 15 months ago.  He hasn't thrown in 15 months.  Exactly.  You miss 15 months of...  You know, it's going to be, what, 19 or 20 months by the time he plays again. 
[01:11:00]  And is his neck completely healed?  Look, they're taking a big chance on him.  You think?  I hope it all falls apart for Denver.  That'd be great.  Tebow moves on.  He starts being...  You know, a coach knows how to coach him.  He plays a pretty good quarterback.  And then Manning goes down.  Who do you got?  I don't even know who...  They don't even have Brady Quinn anymore.  But Peyton went to the Broncos because he believes they can win a Super Bowl in the  next few years.  No, he did that because there was no family in Denver.  That's why he went there.  Do you think the altitude had anything to do with it?  I love...  The Tennessee Titans offered him to be part owner of the team when he retires. 
[01:11:30]  To own the team.  And just because his fucking wife's family's from there, he didn't go there.  I love the whole angle that they don't go where their family is.  Dude, that's great.  Mark DeSher, remember the guy from the Yankees?  Yeah.  He grew up between Baltimore and D.C.  Okay?  He was a free agent.  His wife's from there.  He's from there.  All of their family's from there.  They go...  And they had two offers on the table.  He goes, fuck it.  I'm going to the Yankees.  And he hated big cities.  And he went there because he didn't want to be around his family. 
[01:12:00]  All right, listen, when football season hits, you've got to call like every Friday.  You have to.  Or every Monday.  Or both.  Or you've got to just do like a quick show on our fucking channel.  I would listen to this every week.  I'll do it.  I've listened to it for three years.  It's great, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's so different than other sports radios.  Do you think the altitude has anything to do with him going to Denver?  I thought it might.  Because he'll get more out of his arm at that altitude than he is.  Maybe.  Maybe. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know.  I mean, it's possible.  These people are lit.  Let's go ahead.  Put them all on.  Mikey.  Fucks.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Florida, Janice.  I called that call before.  I said, fucking Joseph Adai is going to the Broncos.  Joseph Adai averages like one fucking foot of carry.  They have Willis McGahee.  They don't need a fucking running back, stupid.  You're right.  And they got Moreno, too, right?  Whatever his name is there.  Yeah, they got good running backs in Denver.  Fucking dope with dreadlocks to fucking not run the ball.  I say, good point. 
[01:13:00]  The Colts 2-0.  The Colts 2-0.  You don't think it's the Colts 2-0?  Oh, you really like saying that one.  Yeah.  You want more of these?  Yeah.  All right.  Buffalo would take Tebow, this guy's save.  Yeah, they probably would.  Buffalo Bills, Tebow.  It's hard to run in that cold.  Yeah, Buffalo, that would be a good spot.  Yeah, they would sell tickets with him, yeah.  Me in the snow. 
[01:13:30]  Florentine's totally right.  I love it.  All those fucking Denver fans have bought those Tebow jerseys and the kids and the whole  family.  They're number 15.  And now what do they do with them?  You don't think he'll stay and be in backup?  No, he won't.  No.  That's another thing.  I bet you Manning said, I want him out of here because he doesn't want the pressure.  You know, if he has a bad game, all the Denver fans are going to start chanting  Tebow again.  Oh, yeah.  So I bet you that was part of Mr. Diva again.  So that's the Diva part of it.  Mr. Nice Guy, I'm Peyton Manning.  His commercials are good, though.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I'll do another one with fucking Justin Timberlake playing fucking ping pong. 
[01:14:00]  The paddle's hot.  You get it?  Fucking asshole.  He is a blockhead.  Yeah.  We had him on once.  He was nice enough.  I hear he's a great guy.  He didn't really give us much.  No, but I hear he's a great guy.  He's kind of boring, but he's a nice guy.  But, you know, I mean, come on.  And people go, his commercials are funny.  They're not funny.  Oh, really?  You handed presents out, and it's fucking, you know, wrapped like a football.  And the guy goes, it's a football?  He goes, no.  Yeah, that's real funny.  Yeah.  Fucking wrap up a dildo and go, what is this? 
[01:14:30]  And then pull it out.  Then that's fucking funny.  You'd laugh at that?  No.  There's nothing funny about any of his commercials ever.  But if it was a dildo-shaped thing, you didn't get it?  No, I would laugh at that.  I would laugh at that.  I want to go with the people that want to take you on, but there is one guy from Indianapolis  saying you're completely right.  So I want to hear from Glenn.  Yeah, let's hear this guy.  All right.  Glenn, go ahead.  Because he knows.  Glenn knows.  You're right.  All right.  Florentine, you're absolutely right here.  Because, first of all, Manning fucked Indianapolis bad. 
[01:15:00]  Okay?  He gave the guy the fucking world to begin with.  We had shitty teams all around him.  Big fucking deal.  They won their division consistently.  But you know what?  When it came time to step up, the guy always let us down.  He's a fucking choke artist.  Absolutely.  Eight and 12 in the playoffs.  Fucking like 17 touchdowns and 19 interceptions.  Really?  Yeah.  One Super Bowl?  One Super Bowl.  Yeah, he won the one Super Bowl.  It's like a Brett Favre career.  Yeah, and the reason he won that Super Bowl is because Rex Grossman was fucking throwing 
[01:15:30]  the ball for the Bears.  You're right.  That's a good point.  You're right.  And Manning held the Colts up.  Look, he could have negotiated and said, look, I don't need $28 million on fucking March  7th.  Just give me like five and we'll work it out.  They weren't going to pay him $28 million.  Why did he hold up that franchise?  The guy's made $174 million in contracts in his career.  You don't need the money, fuckhead.  Yeah, and you know, as far as anything with Tennessee offering him any type of ownership  stake or management stake, I guarantee you the fucking Colts, Israel offered him the 
[01:16:00]  same goddamn thing.  He chose to walk.  He's the guy that left the team.  I mean, it's not like they kicked him to the curb.  You know?  He could have negotiated something with your owner and stayed there.  Absolutely.  Something that would have been respectable for him, certainly.  Well, doesn't the owner want this young pick instead?  He does, but he could have been behind him for a couple years, like two years, and then  Manning could have went off.  Manning has probably got like two years left with the neck and shit like that and leave  this guy behind him.  They could have worked it out.  You think? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the other thing I'm fucking sick and tired of hearing is all these people who say,  well, Manning's going to be a great fucking mentor for our quarterback.  Let me tell you, there's fucking track record as horse shit for being a backup to Manning  because they're all a bunch of fucking failures anyway because he doesn't let him fucking  practice.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Manning takes every rep in practice.  He won't let a second string guy even practice with the team because he's a fucking control freak.  So that's why they were saying Tebow's not going to beat X.  He's not going to get any reps.  So anyone behind him has been always a piece of shit.  This guy's right.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  I'm punching out.  Good job, Glenn.  That guy knows when to leave.  Sure.  Fucking people saying Tebow to San Francisco now.  Jim Harbaugh would never put up with that.  That guy's a fucking maniac there.  I like how he coaches.  I know.  He's an animal.  He is.  He's an animal.  There's no way he's going to put up with Tebow's shenanigans.  I love the animal coaches.  Tebow's going to fucking bend down the prey.  He's going to kick him right in the balls.  I like Harbaugh.  I like fucking Rex Ryan.  I love these animals.  People like Tebow, though, man.  He's got all those Christians.  They fucking love him.  No, he does.  Absolutely.  I was rooting for the guy last year.  You hate him. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't mind him.  I mean, you know, the religion thing.  We got one of the Peyton Manning commercials for you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's just the one with the Sprint commercial.  Where he's wearing the mustache.  Yeah, but he puts it a little crooked just so you know it's really Peyton Manning.  Like, if it was straight, we wouldn't know.  But he just a little.  I want to know who made that fucking decision on that commercial.  Right, right.  To put in a little crooked.  So then we go, oh, that's Peyton Manning.  That's Peyton.  In disguise.  Yeah.  It's a disguise.  Let's make it crooked.  When it comes to being a better football fan, nothing beats Sprint NFL Mobile. 
[01:18:00]  You can watch exclusive game highlights of all your favorite players, like Peyton Manning.  That guy's pretty good.  If you like 6'5", 230-pound quarterbacks, laser, rocket arm.  With NFL Mobile only from Sprint, you get customizable alerts and real-time stats on your favorite team.  Maybe like Peyton Manning's team, maybe.  Get the only Moto Razor with access to...  That was funny.  Yeah.  It was good.  No, Jim, did you like that the mustache was just a little crooked?  Because then you knew it was Peyton Manning. 
[01:18:30]  Visually, it was very funny.  Right.  It's like Club Soda Kenny when we met him.  Because you know...  The mustache.  You know, it was like some gay guy on the set going, I'd put this...  This would be good if he'd put it a little crooked.  Yeah, yeah.  No, Peyton, the mustache, you put it on straight.  It needs to be a little crooked.  Yeah.  I'm thinking crooked.  They had a little meeting about it right there on set.  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  That's it.  Oh, Peyton, look.  Get him in there.  Get him in there.  Look, that's funny. 
[01:19:00]  Look at that.  That's funny.  This guy is really fired up.  Chris in Jersey.  Go ahead, Chris.  Quarantine.  You're saying Peyton Manning made $170 million.  He made that fucking team and town probably literally a billion dollars.  Yep.  What does he owe them?  He doesn't owe him anything.  I'm just saying, no.  He didn't need to – he could have stayed there and not saying, all right, I'm going  to take $28 million when I can only throw the ball fucking eight yards.  They're saying he should take $5 million.  What the hell is Peyton Manning going to make $30 million the rest of his life? 
[01:19:30]  That's what he's guaranteed on this deal.  Are you going to take a lesser fucking deal because some club booked you fucking first  in your career?  No, but –  Why would you?  You'd get fucking more on to do that.  But if he wanted to stay, they could have worked out something where he's not going  to get $28 million when the guy's throwing like fucking Chuck Knobloch right now.  All right?  So go, look, give me fucking $10 million and then if I play the whole season, then I get  the money at the back end.  That's how you work the deal if he really wanted to stay there.  Why would you take fucking $5 million when you're going to make $30 million?  Are you fucking out of your mind? 
[01:20:00]  Well, that's why he left.  So Peyton Manning's not the good guy here.  He's not.  He's fucking –  It's like everyone else.  If the guy had a real – if the guy's shoulder and neck wasn't bothering him, then he gets  the $28 million.  When the guy hasn't played in 15 months and can't throw a fucking ball, you don't go,  give me $28 million.  I don't know if I'm going to throw, but I want my $28 million.  Fuck that.  If it wasn't for Peyton Manning, they'd be in fucking San Antonio.  Well, then they should go to San Antonio then.  I'm out.  Did he just call it San Antonio?  I think so.  You're hyped up. 
[01:20:30]  You're hyped up.  All right.  All right.  And what about this other rumor that he didn't want to play in San Fran because he didn't  want to compete with his brother there?  No.  Meaning, you know, play him and shit.  He doesn't give a shit.  He doesn't, right?  No.  He wants more Super Bowl rings.  Of course.  He wants to win a Super Bowl.  He'll get over it with his brother.  Yeah.  That's why he wants to stay in the AFC season.  He can beat him in the Super Bowl.  Because I think he has two and he has one.  Yeah.  Yep.  Right.  Eli's got more Super Bowls than him, so he's definitely competitive.  Is Eli better?  No.  I mean, Peyton's a better quarterback, but Eli's more clutch. 
[01:21:00]  Eli's better?  I have to.  Eli plays under pressure.  Holy fuck.  The guy's unbelievable.  I turned the corner on him.  I used to think he was sort of a joke in his brother's shadow.  Not no more, man.  Holy fuck.  He knows how to play.  That guy from Indianapolis said it right, man.  Peyton chokes in the playoffs.  He does.  He's not the same quarterback.  Plus, in Denver, the guy can't throw outside.  Just fucking three-mile-an-hour winds, he's throwing 50% of his passes.  He likes a dome with no wind.  You know, just fucking fast guys running on carpet. 
[01:21:30]  Now he's going to be outside in the fucking cold.  You watch how his stats go way down.  When it starts snowing in November, he's going to fucking, his stats are going to be  five for 20 with two interceptions and one touchdown.  Yeah, good move, stupid.  I think we covered it.  Florentine is wrong about free agency.  He's only holding them up for six days.  No, he wasn't.  He got cut a week before free agency started, so any team can negotiate with him right there.  So, they're wrong.  He got cut March 7th.  It's been fucking two weeks. 
[01:22:00]  Let's go to Gennaro.  Get your facts straight.  Middle Island.  Gennaro, what's up?  What's going on, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, Jim.  I know you know your sports shit, but I think you're a little off on this one.  Now, you headline wherever you go, obviously, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like you in your prime, you know, being cut out and saying, you know what?  This guy that opens for me, I'm going to let him go ahead and finish up this show  in front of me.  When you still got a couple of years, the good years left in you, you can't blame him for  leaving Indy if he still can play at a high level.  So, now, if he sucks, playoff-wise, yeah, sure, but he can instantly turn that team 
[01:22:30]  into a contender.  No, he definitely can, but you can't.  Peyton Manning is not the good guy in this.  He's not the bad guy.  But, look, there was $28 million on the table.  If he really wanted to stay in Indianapolis, he could have worked something out where it  wouldn't have been such a big cap hit, and he could have stayed.  But, obviously, he didn't want to stay for whatever reason it was, and he wanted to  move on.  So, you know, let's not make the Colt owner the bad guy here.  It's because he's a big, greedy, alien-headed fuck.  Well, all right.  Which one?  All of them.  Peyton Manning. 
[01:23:00]  It's the almighty dollar.  That's what I say.  I think they're all greedy, but do you think if he didn't have a chance of winning a Super  Bowl with the Colts, and he really is obsessed with trying to get another Super Bowl ring,  right?  Well, look, if he didn't have a bad neck and shoulder, he would have got the $28 million.  The owner's just protecting himself.  We don't know what the hell.  The guy could get one hit and be out the rest of his life.  You don't know.  And once Polian left, they knew that all the stars were going to leave.  Reggie Wayne signing back there is, like, ridiculous.  But they knew everybody was going to leave, so why not turn it over to a new regime?  That's what they did. 
[01:23:30]  Well, Reggie Wayne had to stay there because Peyton Manning was holding everything up, and  he wanted his money.  So he's like, fuck it.  I've got to sign here.  I need some cash.  Wow.  They're calling you a dick now.  Oh, good.  Peyton could not take less money because of bargaining rules.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Oh, let's hear that.  That might be right.  Let's go to Mark in Jersey, Mark.  I'm obsessed with four guys.  Put them all on.  Let's go.  All six at a time.  They're all calling them.  They want a piece of you.  Go ahead, Mark. 
[01:24:00]  How's it going, boys?  Hey.  It's the bargaining agreement.  He can't take less money.  He can restructure his deal, but at the end of the day, he has to take the same amount  of money.  You're wrong.  He restructured to take less during the year, but they gave him a lump sum as a roster bonus.  You're wrong.  They could have negotiated down where he could have got $10 million.  He doesn't need the $28 million bonus.  The team could do whatever they want, the team and the player.  There's nothing to do with that.  He could have said, look, I'll take 10, and if I play, then I'll get the other $18 million 
[01:24:30]  at the end of the year.  So you're wrong.  The union won't let him take less money.  Bullshit.  Bullshit, but it's true.  It's not true.  Everybody renegotiates a contract.  Sanchez just did it, right?  They just added two years on.  They gave him a little less this year, put it at the back end.  That's what they do.  Right.  So he's making the same amount of money or more over the contract.  No.  He could have negotiated $10 million, and then he gets $18 million if he finishes the season.  They could have worked it out, obviously.  But he wanted his $28 million, and he was leaving. 
[01:25:00]  And the Colts couldn't afford it, so he left.  So he's not the fucking good guy here, Manning.  The guy can't even throw, and they're going to give him $28 million.  I don't think so.  You guys are on radio.  You know, like, if you can't fucking do a show, they're not just going to go, here's  $28 million on your past.  Even if we can, they don't want to give us that.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right, brother.  But wait, sir, you might be right.  You're saying that the union wouldn't allow him to take less.  That's why I understand it, Ian. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, because I know.  Because no teams renegotiate their contracts.  No players do that.  When they want to sign somebody, they don't fucking renegotiate it, so they get less.  No, I never heard of that.  I think wanting to get another Super Bowl ring played into that whole decision, too.  You just didn't feel like you could have done it.  But Denver's got no defense.  If you're going to do that, you go to the 49ers.  That's your best shot.  Best shot of the Super Bowl.  So, let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  A couple more, and then we'll move on.  Yes.  Hello.  You're a fucking moron.  Oh, wow.  You're only jealous that he didn't go to the fucking Dolphins. 
[01:26:00]  I don't care.  Look, yeah, I would have liked him there.  Okay.  You're only jealous that he didn't go to the Dolphins.  The only reason why the fucking Broncos were good and kept him in games is because of their defense, you fool.  Because of what?  Because of their defense.  Well, kept him in games for Tebow to fucking win him in the fourth quarter in an overtime.  Yeah, do you remember that Denver let up over 40 points in five different games last year?  They got no defense, asshole.  Right.  They have no defense.  Yeah, why don't you look at the scores from last year and see that they have no defense?  Right.  They gave up 40 points in every single game, and Tebow was an offensive juggernaut? 
[01:26:30]  Right.  They gave up points in a couple of games.  A couple.  Yeah, because all of a sudden, five's a couple.  Right.  Yeah, all of a sudden, hey, there's a couple over there.  No, that's not a couple.  That's five people.  You're like a chick.  You know when a chick's like, oh, I go, hey, let's go to the Meadowlands and go see  a concert.  That's like an hour and a half away, because they don't want to see the show, but then  if they want to see it, it's only 10 minutes.  They shave a fucking hour off. 
[01:27:00]  That's what you just did, asshole.  It's a couple of times.  You can't devalue your contract.  That's the same thing that's when you tried to go to Boston.  You can't devalue your contract.  If you backload it, you backload it, but it's the same contract.  You dope.  What are you talking about?  If he devalued his contract, and so I'll just take less, and if I play, I'll do this.  It's the same money.  He's just deferring it.  That's what I said.  I said I had no problem with that, but the guy before said, you can't do that.  I know you could do that, asshole. 
[01:27:30]  Why would he do that and leave fucking $15, $20 million on the table?  So he could show the team that he could play, because the guy can't fucking throw right now.  Right.  So he should defer it for the young guy.  If they're going to pay another guy, number one salary, they have to still pay luck.  Okay.  And how much is luck going to get with the new rookie scale?  He's only getting like $5 million a year, so it's not that big of a hit.  Only $5 million with a hot cap?  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Because God forbid you play a quarterback $5 million.  It's not like he doesn't get $60 million anymore. 
[01:28:00]  New receivers, they still have to go get a new defense, which is always blown.  But they should lock up $40 million in their quarterback when only one of them can play.  What?  I said they should lock up $40 million in their cap when only one of them can play.  They still have to pay both of them.  Okay.  So what's your point?  My point is that he should look to get every dollar that he can.  They still have to pay both of them.  They might as well go in a new direction with luck.  Manning's already got his money.  If he really wanted to stay, he would have stayed. 
[01:28:30]  They could have worked it out.  And so do you.  If a club wants to cancel and you have a contract, you're going to say,  well, I already got my money.  I'll leave it there.  Sometimes you take less of a guarantee, though.  Honestly, dude, you'll take less of a guarantee.  Like, say you go to a place and you make a certain amount.  If you didn't sell a lot of tickets, the next time in, you can restructure your fucking deal.  You take less of an upfront guarantee, and there's a bigger back end.  So if you sell tickets, you get more money.  That actually has done a lot to use the company.  I get that, Jim.  I understand that.  But if this guy takes one hit, he could be a paraplegic. 
[01:29:00]  So for the comedy factor, he should assign that.  God willing.  If he takes one hit, he might shit his spine out.  You're right there.  But that's why I'm saying, why doesn't he?  So the Colts will go, look, we can't give you $28 million,  and we don't know if you could throw again if you get one hit.  So let's renegotiate down, and we'll give you a back end.  We'll give you $10 million up front.  If you play the whole season, we'll give you the other $18 million at the end of the season.  And if he couldn't play, he should have been the backup to Andrew Luck after all he's done for that franchise.  He put that town and that franchise on the map. 
[01:29:30]  I'm not saying he was a winner everywhere he went.  He's not Tom Brady.  But to say he should have left all that money on the table and just left it as a, well, if I can do it, then you can pay me.  But wait, let me ask you a question.  What about insurance, though?  Wouldn't insurance cover that if he got hurt?  Wouldn't that not count against the team's cap, or would it?  No, it would still count against the cap.  It definitely would.  Especially if he doesn't play.  It's a worse hit because he's not even playing.  Oh, and he still counts against the cap?  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, you're just jealous because he's not with the Dolphins.  I ain't lucky.  Some people are saying.  If he would have went there, it would have been better what they have. 
[01:30:00]  And they signed, what's his name anyway, right?  The Dolphins?  Romo?  Garrard?  Garrard, yeah.  Good move.  No, I don't, look.  Was that a good move?  No.  But there's nobody else out there.  They're fucked.  So that's why they signed him?  But nobody wants to go to Miami because that owner's an ass and so is the GM.  Who owns this?  It's not his angust, is it?  No, this other guy, Steven Ross.  Everybody hates.  Have a good one, boys.  See you, man.  One more?  Because this guy's calling you a dick.  We've got to go to him.  Put him on.  One more.  And then the rest of them are pretty much points you've sort of made already. 
[01:30:30]  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  A lot of Jersey guys mad at you.  Oh, yeah.  Mike?  Florentine, you're a douchebag.  First of all, the owner told him last year in the contract, like, I'm going to make you  the highest paid quarterback more than Brady.  It gave him all that money.  Then last year, at any point in time, he could have put him on injured reserve and gave Peyton  Manning a free check of money for sitting on his ass.  And then finally, he could have cut Peyton Manning at any point after the Super Bowl and 
[01:31:00]  did it.  So, I mean, what's your point here?  So, Peyton Manning for no money because the owner's the dick?  What does that have to do with him not putting him on IR?  What does that have to do?  He would have got his money either way.  He was hoping Manning would have played.  He did it for Manning because he was hoping Manning would have came back and played the  last few games of the season.  So, you're trying to tell me that if someone gave you $28 million, they're going to say,  oh, no, I'm going to take only $5 million.  No, but I'm saying he could have worked it out.  Peyton Manning isn't. 
[01:31:30]  Work out what?  I'm going to give you money.  Here's $28 million.  Oh, no, I'm going to renege on the contract?  When the guy's got a fucking noodle arm, yeah, you've got to go, hey, all right, I'll  meet you halfway.  If Peyton Manning could throw like he used to be able to throw, then you take the $28  million.  We don't know if this guy's ever going to play again.  So, you're going to give him $28 million.  I mean, the goddamn San Francisco 49ers had a perfectly good quarterback and wanted to  go into the Manning drama. 
[01:32:00]  Same thing with Tennessee.  I mean, in Miami, it's a wasteland.  No one wants to play for fucking Miami.  So, you're going to try and tell me that next time you go to a club and say, oh, we're going  to give you $10,000.  Well, maybe we'll only give you $5,000.  You're going to say, oh, okay, I'll take $5,000.  No, that's not, all right, let's just say I can't speak and maybe, I don't know if I  could do a full hour show.  Tickets would sell faster.  Sell outs across the board. 
[01:32:30]  All right, so then I go, look, maybe I can't get $10,000.  I don't know if I could do the whole show.  I don't know how my voice is going to be.  So, I'll take $5,000, and if I do the whole show, then I take the $10,000, motherfucker.  Okay, he's got a bad fucking neck.  That's what the whole $28,000 is about.  We don't know if he's ever going to play again.  And I've been looking up stats.  Denver was ranked 20th last year in defense.  20th in defense, mister.  Oh, they've got a great defense.  That was more than a couple.  Yeah, more than a couple.  The Colts already knew they had a fat neck, and they still gave them the money. 
[01:33:00]  That's true.  Well, they had to last year.  Well, they didn't know.  You know, when you're talking about that neck injury, sometimes guys heal in a couple months.  Sometimes it takes a year.  You don't know.  Didn't Brady take less money to free up some cap space?  A lot of guys do.  A lot of guys do.  But all of a sudden, Peyton Manning's not allowed to.  So, it's not unheard of, obviously.  Of course.  A lot of guys do that.  I got to go, guys.  Take care.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Did we do it?  I mean, they're still out there.  Oh, yeah.  I want Florentine on this channel during the football season. 
[01:33:30]  He knows his shit.  We got to try to figure something out.  We give you free plugs for a radio show.  That's about all we could offer.  You suck.  That's great.  Bill Burr finally said, fuck you and your free plugs.  I don't blame him.  Maybe he didn't say it in that way.  Did he pull his podcast?  Huh?  Did he pull the podcast?  I'm not getting anything.  Why would I do this?  He's past the, you know, giving up material for free plugs.  Yeah.  Are you past that yet?  No, I'd still do it.  All right. 
[01:34:00]  Good.  Good.  And nothing against Burr.  I start doing theaters like Burr.  No, Burr's smart.  Maybe.  I completely understand where Burr's coming from.  Yeah.  Because, you know, these assholes will spin it and next thing you know, we have a problem  with Bill Burr.  No, we don't.  Not at all.  We kind of want these assholes down the hall to pay some of these guys.  Dude, they were bad mouth, you know, on the show today.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they're saying.  It's like, what?  But he basically said, no, I'm past the hole.  Nah.  I'm doing stuff for plugs.  Was he doing his podcast?  Well, he did it for years for us.  You know, a lot of shit.  So, I get it.  But you're not at that point yet, right? 
[01:34:30]  No.  Oh, good.  We'll get you for one football season.  Yeah, well, I'll do a podcast and then I'll just give it to you guys.  You can throw it on.  Yeah, we always get these guys just for a little while so they realize how badly they're being  shat upon.  And they're like, fuck this.  I don't blame them.  Not at all.  You want a serious sweatshirt?  Yeah.  I don't blame them.  Push on the website.  I did a show here for a year for free.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it's good.  Good exposure.  What the fuck?  What am I in college?  Anyone who says exposure is your aunt.  That's the worst.  Your aunt says good exposure. 
[01:35:00]  Your aunt.  You guys never really got paid for that show, huh?  No, they were working up the contracts.  It's like, no, we're writing them up.  Just keep going.  Oh, yeah.  Keep going.  Keep going.  We're writing them.  All right.  Now, sign on the line and $25 a show is yours.  Oh, really?  Was it really that bad, the money?  Oh, my God.  It was no money.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  They're killing everyone.  They're killing them.  They're not paying anyone.  Well, Rosie's still here, right?  I don't know.  I have no idea, to be honest.  I don't know.  I think she's still here.  That was a bust for SiriusXM. 
[01:35:30]  Way before Rosie was a bust for Owen, she was a bust for SiriusXM, but no one wants to  talk about that now, huh?  No.  Did Elo make the cut?  Yeah, he did.  Oh, phew.  Yes, he's staying.  It was like a bloodbath.  They pushed 30 people out the fucking door over there at Oprah's network.  I was getting a little nervous for Elo.  Actually, I was feeling kind of good.  I was like, ah, you know, I know he loves it and stuff, but I want to see that same old,  puffy, drunk bastard Elo, come back here.  He would go back to that puffy drunk within months. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, man.  Doing radio.  I want him fired from Owen and back here.  Fuck yeah.  He's totally a metrosexual now.  He's all fucking wearing perfectly tailored suits.  His hair is done perfectly.  He's thin and healthy.  We need him to come back here and just fuck his life up again.  I saw him just drink it out of mini bars, out of little bottles.  He laughs politely.  Now, if you do a little witticism, he'll give you one of those.  That's how Oprah likes to laugh. 
[01:36:30]  That's why.  I was watching for a little while the Oprah reality show on Owen.  Yeah, for a little while.  I was trying to do, and Elo showed up a lot.  No, I watched most of the episodes, and Elo showed up a lot just petting Oprah's dog.  Oh, God.  Like this.  Oh, boy.  Just petting her dog.  Oh, no.  That's not the guy we know is what we're getting at.  No.  Oh, my God, no.  He was the guy that when we used to call him on the air, he'd play back fucking sound effects.  He'd have his own sound effect machine on his desk and play it back to us.  He was on Pal Talk. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  He was on Pal Talk and just fuck with the listeners.  Like, don't you have a deal to make today?  Yeah, I guess he did with Oprah.  Yeah, no kidding.  Fuck this place.  This is the one place that there's no interest in us.  That's good.  Thanks.  He was one of the few rats that jumped this ship and stayed nice and dry.  The one place that has no interest in us.  That could be any company.  Well, that could be anywhere in this country.  But the one place without a fucking doubt.  Usually when your guy leaves, they come calling for you.  They're like, yeah, I got a gig over here. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, I got a spot for you guys.  Yeah.  You're really on own?  Yeah.  If he went to the Rape Crisis Hotline, we'd have a better shot at getting a gig.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at.  That's what I'm getting at.  Florentine, where are you going to be?  It's JimFlorentine.com.  It's I'm Your Savior at the Producers Club.  Oh, you're doing that.  You're still doing that, huh?  It's going well?  Yeah.  That's the one-man show, right?  Yeah, I'm doing it this Friday in New York.  And then I'm doing this Laugh and Skull Comedy Festival down at Atlanta.  I'm opening the festival next week.  Is that Metallica?  March 28th.  What is that festival?

Relapse Theater, March 28th.  March 28th.  I'm doing that show down there.  And this Friday, Producers Club is on West 44th Street.  Yeah.  That's a great space.  I saw Jim's show there.  It's a fucking really cool space.  Yeah, him and Bobby Kelly gave me some good notes.  I want to go.  Friday?  Yeah.  Got a seat?  Absolutely.  I'll stand in the back.  I sat in the back and cut gassers.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  A little happy face out in the half of the crowd.  I think I'm in town, man.  I would love to go see your romance show.  I'm your savior.  Producers Club is Friday.

[01:40:30]  Fucking loving Florentine.  That was fun.  You got new fans today, by the way, Jim.  New fans today.  Yeah?  Yeah, for your football rants.  They're loving you.  Yeah, I'm sure to Peyton Manning fans.  I don't think we have a big fan base in Denver, so don't worry about it. 
[01:41:00]  I think you're sticking up for Indianapolis, in a way.  This Friday, I'm your savior at the Producers Club on West 44th Street in New York City.  That's where Florentine's doing his one-man show.  So, brownpapertickets.com.  Are tickets selling well for that show?  Yeah, it's a small theater.  You know, I'm working on it because I'm doing this festival in Atlanta next week.  I'm opening this festival, doing the show at the Relapse Theater.  Right, right.  Atlanta, Wednesday, March 28th.  So, I'm just, you know, working kinks out.  Atlanta's a great market for the show.  Love it, man.  It really is, man.  Jamie came back recently saying, holy fuck. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Great place for fucking what you do and what I do.  We got to talk about the mayor of New York City.  What does she do now?  Mayor Bloomberg.  I didn't know about this.  For honor.  And you know about this one, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This has been a few days.  It's been making some noise.  Mayor Bloomberg.  You know how he is about food, right?  He hates salt.  Oh, he hates.  Not a fan of salt, sodium, and grease.  He hates grease.  He hates anything.  Trans fats. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, my God.  Does he hate a trans fat?  Why do you have to make laws about trans fats and salt?  Because he is the nanny mayor.  But people, if you want to eat that way, whatever.  I don't give a fuck.  Nana mayor.  Nana mayor.  And I don't care how much it costs me in health fees.  Well, he cares.  Thank God.  He's not a care.  I know.  Medical costs.  Jesus Christ.  Just need to know about your fee, Jerry.  Your health fee.  Your health fee, Jerry.  Oh, I stink. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I'm the worst.  Stan Grossman will tell you.  No, the thing the mayor's doing is, well, we got this homeless problem here in New York City.  I don't think it's a surprise to anybody.  But not as bad as our cities.  Cleveland is scary.  Since Julianne, they've still been able to keep it kind of in check.  But the homeless, they get hungry, right?  And for years, the homeless shelters and soup kitchens and whatnot have gotten contributions from citizens and stores and restaurants of good food to feed these hungry homeless people. 
[01:43:00]  That's nice.  Well, the mayor has said that these establishments will no longer be accepting contributions.  They are not allowed to accept them because they can't figure out what the nutritional value is for all this stuff that they're feeding the homeless. 
[01:43:30]  And until they could do that, you can't just feed the homeless stuff with a lot of salt and a lot of fats and trans fats.  This is a joke, right?  No.  He honestly did this.  You cannot now contribute food to the homeless.  I don't go a day without seeing a homeless guy digging for his fucking dinner in a garbage pile.  And I think it's the difference between starving and maybe feeling a little bloated because you had some salty soup. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, they need to put some weight on to fill out with the fucking salt.  Exactly.  He's got to get that winter coat on.  These guys are pulling out a half a burger with a loogie on it.  Yeah.  What do they care?  Well, this shows how out of fucking touch this guy is.  Wouldn't it be funny if his real motive was, I just think it's funnier to watch them starve.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, that's not why he's doing it.  It's a lie.  What is it?  Lawsuits.  Yeah.  Because a few guys have sued for eating stuff that got them sick or blah, blah, blah. 
[01:44:30]  And the city is too open to lawsuits by having food that they did not prepare be given to these people in their shelters.  It's all prepared the same way.  Yeah, but nobody ever wins those lawsuits when they sue McConnell.  Oh, no, no, but the city still has to – no, they'll probably sue the city.  Right.  So the city still has to defend it, and they don't want to say it's too much litigation.  So they fucking just go, no, we can't judge the health factor.  Because if people said, what, you're afraid of a bunch of lawyers, I guarantee that's it. 
[01:45:00]  Because they know that they're homeless.  They don't care about the health.  When are we going to push back as far as frivolous lawsuits go?  In England they do.  Yeah.  How do they do that?  They chop your foot off.  Nice.  Hold for it.  Nice.  I think if it's really frivolous, you have to pay.  Yeah, but that seems like it's fair.  I agree.  That would cut it down a little bit.  But then the lawyers wouldn't get as much action, right?  Yeah.  As much work.  We're a very litigious nation, and it's sickening because it's all the stuff that happens because of it. 
[01:45:30]  You know?  Sue whoever you want.  But then there's peripheral things that happen.  People start hunkering down and guarding themselves from lawsuits before they ever happen,  and it takes away things that people can do, want to do, want to eat.  So as much as we don't really like our mayor, he has no choice in this, you're thinking,  Jimmy?  Ah, there's a choice.  You fucking deal with it.  You just tell him.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, I don't think, even though he has a nudge and I hate him, I don't think it's  just about salt.  I think you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater on this one. 
[01:46:00]  I think, uh...  I would never do that.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You drain the tub and then molest him.  Wrinkly little guy.  Yeah, their feet are all wrinkled.  Oh, Jesus.  My kids' feet aren't wrinkled anymore, so I'm okay with that one.  Your kids' feet isn't, they're not wrinkled anymore, right?  When you put them in the tub, they get all wrinkly, don't they?  Yeah, they get wrinkled, flinched. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All wrinkly.  Take the lines out with kisses.  They're born with very wrinkly feet.  Are they?  Oh, you fucking did.  Baby's feet and heads smell good.  They really do.  They smell cute.  Like, their little...  It's nature does that, so you want to hug them and hold them and shit.  Their assholes smell like shit, though.  They're very cute.  John Montone.  John Montone.  I was driving and listening to John.  We've known John for many years. 
[01:47:00]  He did our show once.  Yeah.  He works at the news station here, a very famous news station, 1010 Winds.  You could hear that in Goodfellas, by the way, when Ray Liotta's in the shower and Jimmy  pulled off that heist, the Lufthansa heist, it's 1010 Winds.  We have a report of the biggest raw theft in...  And he's listening to 1010 Winds.  Is that guy still on 1010 Winds?  Probably is.  Probably?  I have no idea.  But, yeah, Winds is very...  It's kind of not...  It's been in a lot of movies. 
[01:47:30]  And John Montone does kind of the, I don't know, man on the street and the little...  Human interest stories.  Yeah, human interest stories.  That's what I was looking for.  The human interest stories.  He works five minutes a day.  Right.  How do we get that gig?  I'd love that gig.  He does one little human interest piece every day.  He goes to, like, a guaranteed opening day.  He'll be at Yankee Stadium.  John Montone with the fans at Yankee Stadium.  Pothole season.  Pothole season.  Even though he had an easy winter.  We're here with Ronaldo, who's patching potholes. 
[01:48:00]  How is this job going?  Well, it's very difficult to fill a lot of holes.  There's a lot of holes indeed, Ronaldo.  10-10 wins.  I'm John Montone.  That's his whole gig.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, snow spur, snow storm.  He's at a home depot with the snow shovels.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  Coney Island.  He does a little Coney Island action.  Yeah, you're going to be shoveling this?  Well, I'm going to get my wife to shovel.  How are you getting your wife to shovel it?  He's getting his wife to shovel it. 
[01:48:30]  E-Rock's got a real one.  It's quick.  Oh, okay.  Worth playing.  Go ahead.  Now, most drivers were taking it slow, except for this pinhead in a Honda.  70 miles per hour in the snow on 287, passing a tractor trailer in the right lane.  Buddy, if you're still alive, slow down.  John Montone, 10-10 wins.  Oh, that was a reprimand.  Yeah, he's very unique in his delivery.  I think it was him.  I was driving in this morning. 
[01:49:00]  I was listening to Traffic.  I think it was him.  They go, coming up, teens like the Texans.  No, this is the one.  This is the one.  I just turned it on.  And I'm like, I'm not tuning in.  I'm not going to wait five minutes for that story.  Well, we did.  It was hilarious.  I heard it.  I was driving in.  It's hilarious.  That's the only reason we're bringing this up.  Because he starts acting.  Yes.  He does an acting little piece in it.  And he's using a vernacular from years ago.  No, it is very John Montone. 
[01:49:30]  Well, there's a new report out on teens and texting, and the times are changing.  Now, here is the generational divide.  Steve would rather talk than text.  He doesn't even know what BFF means.  I am 47 years old.  I don't do BFF.  Best friend forever.  Best friend forever.  That guy knew.  LOL, BRB.  Wasn't my guess.  Be right back, Steve.  Let's talk to your young buddy, Jay.  And you, uh, you text a bit.  Yes, I do.  More than I talk.  How come? 
[01:50:00]  I can talk to multiple people, and I don't have to deal with the small talk.  A new poll finds that teenagers are sending a hundred texts a day.  What's up with that?  Oh, sorry.  I just have to reply to this, uh, text.  O-M-G.  John Montone, 10-10 wins.  In it.  Oh, excuse me. 
[01:50:30]  I have to reply to this text.  They're very primitive sound effects.  I know.  What the hell was that?  AOL text.  I know.  Instant message.  They're in that fucking 10-10 wins, like, sound room, just trying to find some kind  of sound, like a, a, a tech.  How about you fucking have your friend text you, and you just record that into a mic?  Yeah.  That'd work better than that archaic sound.  Oh, a picture of my cock. 
[01:51:00]  Let's hope she's over 18.  John Montone.  Sending cock pics from Times Square.  Texting is boss.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, that's what they teased at the top of the hour, going, you know, texting, and I'm  like, I'm going to really listen for five minutes to hear that story.  Yeah.  You didn't care about it?  Really?  Kids like to text and want to talk?  Do they?  Holy shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  But the way John puts it, OMG, I want to tongue your asshole. 
[01:51:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But they did.  Someone went in that sound room and put those sound effects on there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this is a good piece.  Like, yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  It's a good sound right there.  We'll put two.  Not one.  Let's put two.  And then, John, when you hear that, make it like you've got to take a text.  Yeah.  Can you act?  Of course I can.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  I have a text coming in.  Oh.  And then why was he typing back on a keyboard?  It's from Cute Twink. 
[01:52:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  He was using a keyboard at the end.  Yeah, what was that?  Well, it's the fucking AOL sound effect there, wasn't it?  Like, did you?  I think so.  OMG.  What's he?  Typing on a generator?  John, no tone, 10-10 win.  Can you go back up?  OMG, it's three letters.  It's terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  He typed out like 20, 30 fucking letters there.  I want to hear the instant message sound.  I think that that was, I could be wrong, but it reminds me of the AOL, the old instant message  sound.  Hold on, we've got to find it now. 
[01:52:30]  Do-do-do.  Hold on.  Do-do-do-do.  Somewhere in here.  I don't have to deal with the small talk.  A new poll finds that teenagers are sending 100 texts a day.  Ah.  What's up with that?  That's instant message.  I'm sorry, I just have to reply to this text.  OMG.  And it's all like, blah, 10-10 wins. 
[01:53:00]  It's like industrial noise in the background.  Yeah.  Like he's sending a message to Apollo 13.  Oh, that one.  Oh, my God.  OMG.  Yes.  I sent a picture of my genitals to a nine-year-old.  OMG.  That stands for, oh, my goody.  I'm so happy.  John Montone here at the tombs. 
[01:53:30]  Rikers Island.  But we love the guy.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking John rules.  I was texting, and I ran over a stroller.  Excuse me while I take this patent leather shoe out of my grill.  I shouldn't have been texting John Montone on the Northern State Parkway in a puddle of blood.  T-B-O-T-W-S. 
[01:54:00]  That's Teddy Bear on the windshield.  Texting and driving is very dangerous.  Take it from me, John Montone.  Oh, man.  Driving the wrong way down the Taconic Parkway.  Oh, John.  Such a card.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  That's good for him.  Huh?  It's a new poll, though.  Yeah.  A new poll is saying.  Why is that outrageous?  A hundred a day?  That's easy.  That's not that much.  I could do a hundred texts a day.  That's easy.  Yeah.  In a hundred texts.  Wait a minute.  How many do a day, really?  I'm good for maybe 20.  20 a day.  Really?  I probably do a hundred.  Because I don't call people anymore.  I just fucking write people.  I do a lot more than that.  I probably do a hundred.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  I thought 20 was a decent amount, no? 
[01:55:00]  What do you do?  Yeah, 30, 40, something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  I just got to go like, yup.  Text that.  Oh, I hate it.  One word text back to them.  I hate it.  I'm a big fan of T-Y.  Gotcha.  I text back T-Y a lot.  Yeah?  That's it, man.  That's all you get.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Or an O-K every once in a while.  Or O-M-G.  Never O-M-G.  Katy Perry.  She's got nice titties.  And she's redoing whose song here? 
[01:55:30]  Sam.  A little controversy here.  She did at a performance.  What she did?  In England.  She did N-Words in Paris.  What?  Oh, you don't say the word?  Sam doesn't say the word.  You don't say the word because of your people?  Just a matter of being respectful.  What happened over there?  Respectful to who?  It's a fucking story.  Yeah.  What's the name of the song for real?  And who does it?  Jay-Z and Kanye West. 
[01:56:00]  And they do a song called what?  N-Words in Paris.  Is it called N-Words or is it called Niggas in Paradise?  No, it's not.  It's Nazis.  It's an old war piece.  See, because the Nazis.  Is it A or the ER version?  So you can say the A.  Niggas in Paradise.  You can say that.  It's the name of the song.  It's Paris.  Paris, whatever.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  Paris is angry.  She got in trouble?  Yeah.  Wow, wait.  It's about Paris Hilton.  Oh.  Wow, yeah.  Katy Perry does have some great tits. 
[01:56:30]  She's got really nice eyes, too.  That fucking hat should be taken off in a full and safe.  I hate when fucking girls wear that stupid, like, East Lower East Side fucking hipster hat.  What about when guys wear them?  I hate it.  They wear like the-  All the guys in L.A. wear those goofy hats.  Those fucking douchebags.  They wear like the fucking t-shirts.  The pork chop hats.  And they think that they're interesting and intriguing.  It's like you're not fucking artistic with that hat.  Pork chop hats.  Pork pie hats, they're called.  I know.  You want to get pussy at the end of the night just like every other dirt bag. 
[01:57:00]  They're fucking terrible, those hats.  They really think they look interesting with them, though.  Like, they have a story to tell.  Well, it's terrible.  More importantly, I'm looking at a picture of Katy Perry, and she's lopsided.  What?  The right one is dropping a little bit more than the left.  Well-  I thought the left was always the bigger boot.  She's moving.  You think that's what it is?  Yeah.  And chicks do have, like, you know, different sized titties.  It's usually the left side because it's closer to the heart or something.  Remember this whole bit?  Maybe she's right-handed and uses her right hand a lot and works up that peck muscle underneath it. 
[01:57:30]  Well, yeah, she did Niggas in Paris, but she chose to change the whole fucking end part of the song.  So why not just not do the song?  Yeah, she took out all the profanity.  What?  What's wrong with these people?  Profanity?  That's not profanity.  Don't do the song.  Don't do the song.  All the cursing and all the N-words.  Of course.  She changed.  A little artist. 
[01:58:00]  This is about to get very embarrassing.  Right.  Is that Rebecca Black? 
[01:58:30]  Why is she rapping?  She's an embarrassment.  This is crapping. 
[01:59:00]  Where was the N-word part?  It's in there.  I just don't like the fact that she changed it.  Don't sing it then.  Yeah.  So she just got, what did she call it then?  She didn't, she just started singing it.  Instead of saying niggas, what did she say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You said a word.  Ninja.  Ninja?  Oh, boy.  Ninja?  Really?  Yeah.  What's wrong with these people?  Who even knows this song?  It's a big song.  No, it's not.  It's a big song.  No, no, it's not.  Ninjas are offended.  No, it's not a big song.  Fucking.  No.  Nope.  A bunch of 14-year-olds might think it's a big song. 
[01:59:30]  Ah, and for five minutes.  And you, Sam.  Because you're on Hits 1.  What's a big, well, this song's not a Hits 1.  So it's not a big song, then?  Well, it's not a crossover.  Proving Florence's point.  It's a hip-hop hit.  It's not a big song.  It's niche.  Yep.  You don't think this is big, Jim?  No.  In 10 years, is anyone going to listen to this song?  Is anyone going to, in 10 years, go, that song was great?  No.  It's big right now.  No, it's not.  The moment.  It's just pop crap is all it is.  None of this shit's going to stand the test of time.  None of this fucking hip-hop.  Let me see your games.  Well, some of it.  I mean, I don't know this specific.  Eminem stuff, Eminem and maybe some of Jay-Z's stuff, that's it. 
[02:00:00]  This is a Jay-Z song.  Right, but he's with the fucking other asshole.  Kanye's very good, though, even though I don't like him.  No, he's not.  I like his songs.  He's not good.  I don't like him, though.  It's like listening to pop.  It's like listening to when you were a kid, like that New Wave shit was in.  Thomas Dolby, You're Blinded Me with Science.  That's so fun I'd listen to.  Right, but it's just like, it's just nostalgia, but it's never, you know, that's what hip-hop is right now.  You're not putting it on seriously. 
[02:00:30]  It hasn't evolved.  It's the same shit.  Nobody's doing anything new for the last 20 years, but nobody will call it out.  I liked the gangster rap.  It's still my bitches, my hoes.  I got this.  I got my bling.  I got a fucking Range Rover.  Nobody's writing anything interesting.  Nobody's taking it to the next level.  What else can they write about?  Fucking investing in mutual funds?  At least with rock, it changes.  It goes from fucking, you know, hair metal, classic rock, hair metal, grunge, new metal, whatever.  At least it changes.  We don't have rock these days.  Yeah, nobody's talking about rock right now.  We got the Foo Fighters and sort of the White Stripes. 
[02:01:00]  That's about it these days.  White Stripes are not around anymore.  That's why I said sort of, because he's still doing it, just under a different name.  Yeah.  That's what I meant.  Eminem was the only guy to write about being, like, afraid, which I like.  He wrote about real things instead of just fucking having shit.  The writing really does need a lot of work.  Having shit.  But nobody will call it.  See, that's why, you know, grunge came about, because everyone says grunge killed hair metal.  It wasn't.  The radio stations and MTV just said, all right, we don't want to put that stuff on anymore. 
[02:01:30]  Let's change to this music.  They won't do it now, because then they'll be considered racist.  Well, it was overloaded.  The time was right for something new.  But the hip-hop has just been the same garbage for the last 10, 12 years.  So you don't like hearing about the club?  No, but so Rolling Stone's always going to give a hip-hop artist five stars no matter what.  Because if they give them one, like they give every Nickelback record or every Godsmack record  or whatever, that's safe to give them one star.  You're not comparing Godsmack with Nickelback, are you?  No, but I'm just saying that's another band it's easy to pick on.  I love Godsmack.  You don't like Rolling Stone's ratings? 
[02:02:00]  What's that?  No, because they'll give, if Jay-Z puts out fucking just spits for 45 minutes, they'll  give it five stars.  Anybody, if Snoop, come on, says Snoop really wrote a good song in the last fucking 10 years.  You don't like when he still raps about fucking smoking weed?  Yeah, 10 years ago I did.  Okay, we get it, you smoke.  Okay, but they're going to give him five stars, because then they consider racist.  They go, this is garbage, he's not writing anything new.  So they're not going to do that.  And the radio stations won't either, because they're a bunch of pussies too.  What's your problem?  There's nothing.  You've got a lot of problems today. 
[02:02:30]  Very angry man.  Troy Kwan, who is the music master, especially with this genre of music.  And the co-host of the Busy Buddies show.  The Busy Buddies.  How was the first Busy Buddies show?  It was great.  Yeah?  It sounded like the after show.  Yeah, nothing really changed.  But it's now called the Busy Buddies show, according to Club Soda Kenny.  Here comes Kenny.  Fuck, here we go.  I got something to say about music.  No, we're going to do the music.  Don't worry.  No, no, no.  First things first. 
[02:03:00]  See, this is their shtick to act so nonchalant.  Yeah.  Like, they're too cool for the room.  Right.  How is that being a busy...  You're onto them, right?  How is too cool for the room and a busybody the same thing?  It's the complete opposite.  No, it's like your shtick.  Look, I'm talking.  Don't talk.  Oh, man.  All right?  Two opposite things.  Contradictory.  Just do the Busy Buddies show.  Wait, I thought it was a too cool for the room show.  No, that's your subtitle.  Oh.  All right?  And just, you know... 
[02:03:30]  I love him.  Are you losing steam, Kenny?  Yeah, he is.  All right.  All right.  Florentine's here today.  I know.  I've been talking to him.  All right.  But he knows what he's talking about.  All right?  So, Troy, be respectful.  I love you.  Hey, just a little bit more on that song, Niggas in Paris.  Huge right now, according to Seth in Illinois.  Jay-Z and Kanye played Chicago and performed the song five times in a row by request.  Oh, that must have been wonderful.  I hate when bands do that.  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen that. 
[02:04:00]  I went to a Paul Simon show, and that whole You Could Call Me Out, this goes way back.  Oh, I've got ba-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da, oh, shut up.  If I'll be your bodyguard, then you'll be my long-lost pad.  Ya-da-da-da, ya-da-da.  It was Rochester.  Shabby Chase was in the video.  Oh, yeah.  How funny was that?  It was Rochester.  It was about a 15-minute version, and he got the crowd going, obviously.  It was a big hit at the time. 
[02:04:30]  And then when it ended, he goes, man, that was so much fun.  Let's do it again.  It started all from the beginning.  So he did You Could Call Me Out probably for 30 straight fucking minutes.  You Could Call Me Out.  I like the Julio in the Schoolyard song better.  Well, we didn't get to hear that stuff because he was too busy with You Could Call Me Out for 30 minutes.  That's why I had a problem with it.  Fuck.  I've never seen that at a concert ever where I've done this song.  Well, they did that twice.  Who did it?  I think A-Ha does it.  No, no.  I'm going to date myself.  I'm going to date myself. 
[02:05:00]  Modern English would do I'll Melt With You twice in concert because they had nothing else.  They'd start with the song, and then it would be their encore or something like that.  There was another guy, though, Aldo Nova.  Fantasy?  Yeah, Aldo Nova would open and close with Fantasy.  Really?  Yep.  Aldo Nova.  But why are you at an Aldo Nova show to begin with?  I heard.  How old are you?  I'm in my mid-30s.  Nice.  Children of the 80s.  I was born in the mid-30s.  Ah, see, got it. 
[02:05:30]  Troy Kwan, what do you got on hip-hop?  Well, that song, Niggas in Paris, is massive.  No, it's not.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, every time you play it in the club, people just erupt.  In the club, it's massive.  It's a huge song.  It's in the club.  In the club.  Who gives a shit?  People that go to the club find it massive.  It doesn't mean it's massive.  80 people pussing around.  It's not a hit in, like, turn on the fucking radio.  It's huge on the radio.  It's huge on the radio.  No, hold on.  I didn't say on the radio.  Yeah, just like in the club, it depends on who's in the fucking car.  Us four have never heard the song. 
[02:06:00]  We are fucking hip.  It's a demo.  Are you?  I can go to a heavy metal club and they put that band Accept on and the place goes nuts.  That doesn't mean it's a big song.  It's not a big song.  It is for me, but nobody else.  Oh, face.  What makes a big song?  You guys are just thinking one demo.  What makes a big song?  A big song is crossover.  If we know it, it's a big fucking song.  Everyone knows it.  Cross it over.  If you guys know it, it's a big song.  Yeah, because we're fucking in touch with what's going on out there.  I see.  It's all about the pop culture.  It's all about the boundaries.  That's right.  Old people got to like it. 
[02:06:30]  That's right.  Young people got to like it.  Pop people, rock people.  It just, like, strikes a nerve with everybody.  This ain't it.  It's a big song.  Fucking Titanic song was a big song.  That's right.  Near, far.  Wherever you are.  Right.  Rebecca Black, Friday.  Much bigger song than this shit.  Everyone heard it.  Yep.  Jimmy said about heavy metal bands.  They really, I mean, rap just recycling the same thing over and over again.  Really, who in heavy metal today is really pushing the boundaries of what to do? 
[02:07:00]  Sonically, lyrically.  Lamb of God, Shadows Fall.  Yeah, I mean, they're great, but they're just recycling the same.  Lamb of God is doing what Pantera did.  They're just, they're refining it and making it a little bit new.  Right, but at least they're writing.  They're not just writing about, like, we're fucking chicks and we're buying Range Rovers  because we got money.  Yeah, but a lot of it, you know, a lot of it's like Satan and darkness.  Yeah, but they're also, but they're at least they're writing something unique.  They're not writing the same thing that everybody else is writing.  They're writing from the heart.  Bands like Korn, even though they're 90s and stuff, write from the heart, Disturbed. 
[02:07:30]  It's stuff like that.  But even Sully from Godsmack writes good songs and writes what shit's going on in his life  instead of, yeah, I got money now and I fucked the chick on my back of my Range Rover.  Yeah.  But I mean, even like.  And I got some balls.  Sonically.  At the club.  At the club.  Like, they're just sort of recycling what has been done before.  I mean, there are bands that are pushing limits, like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Pig Destroyers,  bands like Every Time I Die.  Oh, don't say that about E-Rock.  But I mean, most of the bands, they really are just sort of recycling what's been done.  But it's not the same.  But rap and hip-hop has not changed the sound whatsoever. 
[02:08:00]  And it's the same lyric content.  There's not.  At least Lama got it.  Remember when it was Limp Bizkit?  They've changed that sound.  New metal's gone.  Now it's more hard.  And stuff like that.  You've got bands like Ghost doing more like a 70s sound.  You're going more back to the 70s.  Right.  It is recycled, but I'm just telling you, the lyrical department is totally different.  And they're not just writing the same shit.  Every band's not writing what Motley Crue wrote about in the 80s, that we're fucking girls.  Yeah, and not every hip-hop artist is right.  You know, who's doing anything you need? 
[02:08:30]  Tyler, the creator.  All the odd future guys are doing something different.  He's overrated.  No one knows who he is.  He's overrated.  These are guys that are coming up in the underground.  You know what I mean?  They're doing something different.  They're, you know.  Like who?  I just said, Tyler, the creator.  I said he's overrated.  He just won Best New Artist.  I mean, overrated.  Big deal.  Christopher Cross did, too.  Exactly.  I mean, an amazing hip-hop artist.  What's in your life, you fuck?  An amazing hip-hop artist, Cool Keith.  He's always pushed the limits.  Who? 
[02:09:00]  Cool Keith?  Fuck no.  Who's Cool Keith?  He's not an originator.  That's Queer Keith.  He's really, he's an amazing hip-hop.  He's an imitator, though.  We all will agree with that.  What is he?  Who is he imitated?  He's in a world of his own.  They don't know who's Cool Keith is.  I don't know who Cool Keith is.  Sounds good, though.  No, but, dude, I love heavy metal, too.  But I just, it just, you kind of hear the same things over and over and over again.  But the mainstream, none of that stuff has hit mainstream, that new hip-hop, the guys  that are doing anything creative.  Yeah, but it's coming up.  Like, Azealia Banks, she's doing something new and fresh.  Ah, she's a fucking hack. 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  She pays no interest.  Yeah.  Oof.  But, I mean, they're coming up.  You know what I mean?  They're doing something.  And there are bands that are doing that.  But a lot of the heavy metal is just, it's regurgitated, too.  You know?  Heavy metal at least changes its sound every five to ten years.  The hip-hop has not changed the sound.  Or the lyrical content.  It's the same exact stuff.  I think, I think maybe to an untrained ear, you could say that.  Oh!  If that ain't a jab right there.  Hey, Mr. Untrained Ear, how does that feel?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:10:00]  You're right, I don't.  It's like somebody that goes, uh.  But whatever, what's mainstream, what's played on the radio, what's popular has not changed whatsoever at all.  Like, you know that there are people that confuse, you know, Metallica with fucking, you know, Godsmack.  It's all the same thing.  But you know that it's something completely different.  Who confuses those two bands?  Yeah, who?  They don't know heavy metal.  Very uninformed.  They don't understand hard rock.  Yeah, who confuses those two?  But it's the same way with hip-hop.  There's a lot of good hip-hop sense.  Through your tears.  And it's different producers.  Answer the question.  Oh, God.  Shit.  Who confuses, what was the question? 
[02:10:30]  Who confuses Metallica and Godsmack.  What are you so, why are you so on fire right now?  Because he got a little positive attention yesterday.  Him and his goddamn Facebook.  He's an idiot.  Listen, busy buddy.  Opie and Anthony have an, and Jim Norton, they have a national talk show.  All right?  Jim Florentine has a radio show.  Yeah.  I do?  A TV show.  A TV show.  He's got things happening.  You're busy buddies.  All right, you're up and coming.  All right?  But give credit where credit is due. 
[02:11:00]  What are you talking about?  I just haven't discussed that music.  I thought it sounded perfect.  I can't have a discussion about music?  No, you can't.  Answer the question.  Well, what's the question, Kenny?  God damn it.  What's the question?  Who confuses Metallica and Godsmack?  I think you came up with a bad example.  People confuse them.  But you know what I'm saying.  There's people that don't.  Answer the question.  That was a bad example.  But you know that there are people that don't know how to, the difference between Metallica  and Megadeth.  Megadeth.  Oh, God.  You hear it.  Another bad example. 
[02:11:30]  It's not a bad example.  Was that a bad example, Kenny?  Yes.  Another one.  Two for two.  Keep going.  Metallica and Iron Maiden.  Oh, God.  No, man.  That's very obvious.  You know that there are people that can't do that.  It's just noise to them.  But you know that it's something completely different than that.  But that's hip hop as well.  There's a lot of...  Do you know what Troy's credit is?  He brings the heavy metal thunder.  Holy shit.  Really?  What is that?  Kenny.  Tell him, Troy. 
[02:12:00]  What's that about, Troy?  Is that your catchphrase on liquid?  He's making shit up again.  Why don't you ask Troy?  No.  Because I tweeted that?  Yeah, tell him.  Oh, because I have a show on liquid metal on Sunday.  What's it called?  It's just my show on Sunday.  But what was the tweet?  I said something about bringing the heavy metal thunder.  Oh, wow.  Did you?  Why?  He's cracking up.  Why would you bring that?  Did you bring the heavy metal umbrellas, too?  Yeah, you need that.  I got caught in a heavy metal thunder storm.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  I got so wet.  It was crazy.  Oh, God.  The dog went all over the rug.  The heavy metal thunder went off.  The dog smells like wet heavy metal thunder.  Make sure you wear your galoshes.  We're getting arranged for pink slips at heavy metal thunder road.  You bring the thunder, Lars?  Oh, yeah, man.  What are you bringing next week?  Do you have a thunderclap when you're fucking?  What do you bring it in?  Your lunchbox?  How do you transport the heavy metal thunder? 
[02:13:00]  Anyway.  I thought thunder was cloud.  It's made of metal and it's heavy.  Oh, it's very heavy.  It's very thunderous.  Light, cloudy thunder.  Troy Kwan brings it.  He knows.  Why isn't Troy laughing?  We were all out of heavy metal thunder one day and we said, where's Troy?  He brings it.  And he brought us some.  A nice slice we all enjoy.  Pass the heavy metal thunder around.  Let everyone see it. 
[02:13:30]  If the heavy metal thunder is on my table, I'll put we on the deal.  Fucking.  Fucking.  Every time Troy enters the studio, it has to be a thunderclap now.  Because he's bringing it.  He's bringing it.  Every time he comes in here.  Does the thunder have to check in downstairs before it comes out?  Is he in the system, the heavy metal thunder?  Oh, look.  The Mother Nature commercial.  He always sounds like that lady.  It's not nice to fool heavy metal thunder.  Heavy metal thunder.  Why would you tweet that? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Can I go to a phone call?  Because I don't want to lose Randall who wants to call Florentine a piece of shit.  Oh.  For thinking wrapped in and evolved.  Oh.  Let me go to Randall.  Randall.  What's going on, y'all?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Got a ninja.  What's up, man?  Yeah.  Well, I like to say that Florentine is the biggest fucking idiot on the planet.  Oh.  They're saying rap hasn't evolved.  20 years ago, the biggest rapper on the planet was LL Cool J.  15 years ago, it was Biggie. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe Tupac, depending on who you asked.  10 years ago, Eminem, five years ago, it was Jay-Z.  And those are all completely different styles of rap.  100%.  Lyrically?  Lyrically.  It's a huge difference between Mama Said Knock You Out.  It's a huge difference between Mama Said Knock You Out, Dear Mama,  which is a Tupac song.  Mama Said Knock You Out, which is an LL Cool J song.  And don't forget, getting jiggy with it.  That was my favorite.  Oh, I loved the jiggy with it.  The Fresh Prince.  May I say something?  Well, yeah.  This guy has no credibility, because he didn't mention one female rapper, so. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, shit.  That's right.  What about Salt-N-Pepa?  What about Sister Soldier?  Yeah.  What about Roxanne Chante?  Everybody knows female rappers.  Yeah.  That's a complete difference.  Yeah, rap has evolved on so many different levels.  It's influenced far more genres of music in the last 20 years than any other genre of music.  Oh, stop.  Randall, I'm a huge fan of Kid Cutie myself. 
[02:15:30]  What do you think of Kid Cutie?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Kid Cutie?  Oh, Cutie.  Did you really say Cutie?  Ah!  Kid Cutie.  Wow.  What?  Kid Cutie.  You know, like, the last...  When he says, like, we don't talk about anything but bling, are you serious?  Have you looked at the fucking charts?  Oh, fuck, Florentine.  That's true.  If you look at...  Yeah, we're in trouble.  If you look at songs like Power, what Kanye West did, and what she's talking about, no  one man should have all the power to be able to go up on stage and take the mic from a 
[02:16:00]  17-year-old white girl who just got her first award ever and say, look, bitch, yo shit  won nothing.  Beyonce's video was better.  She's talking about having all of that power.  You look at songs like Stronger.  Like, nothing that doesn't kill me won't make me stronger.  How the fuck is that talking about bling and fucking...  And what about Blood Diamond, though?  That sounds like it's about gun violence.  I'll say.  And Blood Diamond, he's talking about wearing the diamonds, and he says, Jacob, because  he throws a jab at the Jews.  Go ahead, your turn.  Does Jay-Z bring the thunder? 
[02:16:30]  Hip-hop thunder's different.  Hip-hop thunder.  Yes, it's gunfire.  Florentine's just an uninformed piece of shit.  Oh, man.  He named, like, four guys.  Yeah, Tupac, Eminem, Jay-Z.  Yeah, and L, Cool J, yeah.  But you've named four big acts.  Name the others that are just doing the same garbage.  Yeah, you've got a point.  Okay, because Kanye West wrote one song.  You named, like, the Beatles, Liz Zeppelin, fucking The Who. 
[02:17:00]  Kanye wrote a song.  Bad Company.  Stay Strong.  Ooh.  Really?  You don't like it, Stay Strong?  Ooh.  Like, I mean, like I said, I can go on, you know.  Yo, where you at with Mac Miller?  Yeah.  East Ray.  Yeah, I like Mac Miller, man.  What is UTFO's new record coming up?  Mac Miller, black or white?  Mac Miller is Mac.  Exactly.  He's white.  I don't see color.  Mac is white.  Everyone knows that.  Okay.  And there's a lot of metal bands that are just the same bullshit over, and you know that,  man.  I mean, it's just. 
[02:17:30]  I like, too.  There's a bunch of bands like, like, that, Veins of Jenna, and like all these bands that  just have no, they just have no, there's no.  Veins of Jenna's not even around anymore.  They broke up.  Well, you know, that world of bands, that world of heavy metal where it's just like.  Veins of Jenna.  They needed a bypass.  What?  It was tragic.  Yeah, sure.  Veins of him in the hospital.  She could never tell what the weather was without the veins of Jenna.  Yes.  And if you can't tell what the weather is, how do you know if there's going to be some  of that heavy metal thunder? 
[02:18:00]  Please don't go out in that stuff.  It's dangerous.  I love metal, too.  But I just don't think that there's anybody really pushing the limits musically with that.  Yeah, but they're regurgitating what was done before.  We got a lot of people that want to talk about the heavy metal thunder.  What's your Twitter account again?  Troy Kwan.  T-R-Y-K-U-A-N.  All right.  If you got thunder questions, he's going to fucking answer them.  That's right.  Bring them.  Yo, one more thing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm right here.  All right.  Another thing, Florentine. 
[02:18:30]  Please look at the charts and realize that a lot of the songs, the biggest songs in all  of hip-hop history has almost always been love songs or positive songs.  So to say that we don't talk about the same thing.  Positive songs, like getting away with the robbery.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of rebel music myself.  And that's spelled R-E-B-L because I know.  Yes, right.  I'm in the know.  Hey, what about Milk and Gizmo?  How is their record doing?  How is Milk and Gizmo doing? 
[02:19:00]  No.  You don't remember Milk and Gizmo?  No.  Milk is chilling, Gizmo's chilling.  Randall, do you think the Palmer Squares have a shot at becoming huge or what?  No, I don't even know who the Palmer Squares are.  How's Kool Moe D?  Is his new record doing well?  I just want to name people.  What about Rex in effect?  See, now that gives you the point why you're trying to be funny, Florentine.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you're not funny, Florentine.  Yeah, you're not funny at all.  All right, let me, let me, uh, Kool Moe D.  Actually, you're looking to the point that you were trying to make, you fucking piece 
[02:19:30]  of shit.  Oh!  Oh!  He went there.  Where's the Fab Five Freddy?  He went there.  Where's Fab Five Freddy?  And what happened to the other four?  How about Slick Rick?  If you go back, if you go back and listen to all of those styles, those styles were 20  years ago, buddy.  When you said rap hasn't changed in 20 years.  20, 30 years?  You're being backed into a corner, Florentine.  Yeah, I know.  You might have to scream out, at least I'm white.  Yeah.  Slick Rick.  What about him? 
[02:20:00]  Biting off a Dane and Dane and shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but all those guys are legends.  That's the legendary hip-hop artists.  I like Slick Rick.  Slick Rick, Rex and effects.  Douglas Fresh.  I mean, you put on, you put on, uh, Rum Shed.  Everybody knows that song.  The Sugar Hill Gang.  A little too sweet for my taste.  Oh, wonder my get over here.  What about Grandmaster Mel and all of his friends and cohorts?  What about Africa Bambita? 
[02:20:30]  So where are we at there, Troy?  No, I'm just making a point.  That's all.  Making a point and bringing the thunder.  Yeah, look, I love metal.  That's all, Troy Kwan.  I love metal just as much as everybody else.  Oh, look out.  There's some heavy metal thunder.  Where's Just Dice?  What's your favorite liquid metal artist?  Uh, well, I go more extreme with my metal.  Uh, what's the matter, sir?  Is your phone card running out?  I know how you people get with your phone cards.  Oh, that's not proper talk. 
[02:21:00]  What about the Vanilla Ice?  I enjoy his songs.  I like the melody.  The song with the good melody.  Check out my melody.  That's Eric B and Rackham.  They were marvelous.  One of the best pure rappers.  How about Big Daddy Connie?  How's he doing?  No.  No?  Oh, I thought these were all rhetorical.  My bad.  No, I'm asking about these old school guys. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, like you say, they're all legends, man.  With different styles of rap, different content.  You go back and listen to any of those songs, but like the content changes like every four  or five years.  How about K-Wise?  How's K-Wise?  I don't know who K-Wise is.  He had that one hit stomp, I think it was.  And I remember I saw him live because I was such a fucking douche when I was 18.  And he had big clown shoes on and I thought he was great.  Oh, I don't know this one.  Yeah, I was a couple.  He liked it.  I was such a fucking. 
[02:22:00]  K-Wise.  Look up K-Wise, Sam, if you're not busy texting.  Wise.  Sending cock pics.  Yeah, we're receiving them.  Where are the fat boys?  Oh, God, you remember them with the big beatboxing all over the town?  I hope they've taken their health into consideration, maybe dropped some pounds, the fat boys, so  we can enjoy them.  I can only name rappers before 1993.  Yeah.  Yeah, I see.  Shout out to Troy Kwan for standing up for hip-hopers out there. 
[02:22:30]  There you are.  Oh, shit.  What about the Thunder thing?  You all right with the Thunder thing with Troy?  Fine K-Wise.  He's our own wigger, Troy Kwan.  Yeah, but I love metal.  I love metal a lot.  I mean, one of the best albums that come out so far this year is-  But you bring it.  Well, Anthrax is great.  New Anthrax is great.  Every Time I Die has just put out one of the fucking most brilliant albums I've heard in a long time.  And I like rap, too.  Machine Head onto the Locust.  Machine Head are great.  Yeah, I mean, New Lamb of God is sick.  New Magadath is great. 
[02:23:00]  Fuck yeah, dude.  It's great, but a lot of it is just recycling what's been done before.  I mean, it is what it is.  I mean, there are bands.  Recycling is good for the environment.  It sure is.  I like that.  I separate my bottles with my plastic.  I only eat on plates that have been made out of recycled paper.  Did you find Stomp?  Did you find Stomp?  I'll fucking bite your cheeks, Sam.  I want to go break with Stomp.  This was a one-hit wonder, Jimmy?  We can't find it.  K-Wise. 
[02:23:30]  Look up K-Wise or I'll spit on you.  How do you spell K-Wise?  K-Wise.  Z.  Three Zs.  No, it's probably W-Y-Z-E.  Stomp.  I don't remember the song.  I remember it was really popular.  Maybe it's not called Stomp.  Troy, I forgot some of my thunder.  If you brought some, could you lend me a little bit?  Because I know you always bring the thunder.  Yes, I brought the light aluminum thunder.  Could you bring the heavy metal thunder?  Yeah, the heavy metal thunder, Troy. 
[02:24:00]  K-I's?  What?  Oh, boy, spit on him.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  It's a song.  That's got to be it, right?  Let's hear this.  That's motherfucking K-Wise.  Yeah, I don't remember.  That's motherfucking K-Wise.  How many of you have, motherfuckers?  89?  88?  Yeah, but just...  Jimmy loves this.  I used to like it.  I used to like it, sure.  Oh, let's see.  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  This is very popular.  I'm a dancer.  I'm a dancer.  I'm a dancer.  I'm a dancer. 
[02:24:30]  Did you still rock your head to this, Jimmy?  No.  Oh, yes, you did.  Wow, I never heard of this before.  I got to be honest.  What year is this?  Never heard of it.  It might even be 87.  He doesn't say.  What happened to this guy?  Eights.  It's the only song ever. 
[02:25:00]  What?  Oh, boy.  That was...  Wait, did you see him?  One of those clubs in Jersey.  I think I had just gotten sober.  Convenience store.  I lost some sober people.  Stop.  Can you please say that this doesn't sound like rap anymore?  No.  Like the song we just played doesn't sound anything like that song?  The video is really good.  It's not much different.  That's the point we've been making for the last time.  That's okay.  K-I's his name.  Same shit.  That sounded pretty much like Jay-Z.  I thought his name was something else for 20 years.  What an idiot I am.  See, K-Z, K-Y, and then you got Jay-Z. 
[02:25:30]  They don't even have original fucking names.  Run DMC is very different than what's out now.  Sir, could I borrow a cup of scissor from you, please?  Yes, you can.  Thank you.  Let me ask Florentine a question real quick.  The Jolly Ranch.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Hey, Florentine, how would you feel if I said All Rock was a bunch of satanic bullshit,  a bunch of heavy metal white guys crying about, you know, not being able to get a girl and  how bad their rich lives are?  Damn.  I wouldn't care less.  I could care less.  Really?  All right.  That's cool. 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Well, there it is, man.  It wouldn't bother you?  It wouldn't bother me in the least bit.  Even if it was my band.  Okay.  Oh, right.  Okay.  All right.  That's what it is, I guess.  Sure.  I love Florentine.  The man's entitled to his opinion.  All right, Randall.  You did good today, man.  Thanks, man.  Hi, Randall.  Troy Kwan bringing the thunder.  Is that man?  Educated rapper.  You were full of shit.  Oh, damn.  Educated rapper from UTFO.  Ken Kango Kid.  I don't know any of that. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Mitch Master Ice.  Nope.  I was not listening to that.  I was listening to some fucking Eazy-E.  I was listening to NWA, niggas.  I was listening to all that shit.  That also doesn't sound like what's out right now.  What?  No.  NWA is the shit.  Oh, hell yeah.  I like Public Enemy myself.  Public Enemy is cool.  NWA is cool.  Rolling down the street in my sixth fault.  Bring the noise unless you're bringing the heavy metal thunder.  Yes.  Bring one of the two.  I'll bring the sardines.  He's got a lot of thunder today. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, look.  The dog is nervous.  He runs into the bathtub every time the heavy metal thunder starts when Troy Kwan comes over.  I just want to do that voice all fucking day.  I will be doing this all day long.  It's terrible, but it's so much fun for those that are doing it.  It's nano voice.  Yes.  It's very upsetting for those that are hearing it, but fun for those that are doing it.  So, I suggest you all just do it at home and enjoy yourselves.  Because we're not going to stop.  I'm not even going to stop it when I plug my, what's the place, the Vinny's, the uncle? 
[02:27:30]  What do I know?  If some guy Vinny's got a place, I'll be there in New Jersey Friday, Saturday.  And if some lady named Caroline's got a place in the city, I'll be there the week after.  The 29th through the first Vinny and Caroline, friends of mine.  That's it.  The cross streets to the world.  Whatever the heck they call it.  I call it loud.  Very, very loud.  Only the good half.  All right, Troy Kwan.  Thank you.  Troy Kwan. 
[02:28:00]  Could catch him later on the Friday show.  You'll hear him coming.  Do we got new sweepers for the Busy Buddy show yet?  Not yet.  Should we do them up?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  That's the new name of the show, the Busy Buddy show with Sam and Troy.  Sounds good.  Let's do it.  And the thunder has to be in there.  You need thunder.  Bring it.  Bring it.  You've got to bring the thunder with you.  Sam Roberts, you've got whatever you do.  I don't know what that is, but he's bringing the heavy metal thunder.  Exactly.  In case someone else forgot it.  Yeah.  I just rely on thunder.  He's bringing it.  Yes.  Where does he put it in this place? 
[02:28:30]  Pockets.  Or his little lunch pail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  He probably has to have a metal box so the thunder can't get out.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be strong.  It has to be released into the mics.  Can't put that into a backpack.  Fucking spurt.  How does he put it back in the box?  Yeah, that's true.  At the end of the shift, where does the thunder go?  Where does he store it at home?  Is it in his closet just raining on his shoes?  They're all individually wrapped so you don't go through all of them when you first open up  your little thunder pail. 
[02:29:00]  A thunder pail.  Oh, it's a pail and a lightning bolt on it.  Yes, of course it is.  Don't touch.  There's lots of thunder in here.  Very, very frightening.  Can I borrow some thunder?  I've only got seven thunders.  What am I, made of thunders?  You just came up with a new Twitter name.  Someone's grabbing thunder pal.  Fucking great.  Thunder pal.  Fucking sorry.  That's funny, man.  Yeah.  All right.  More Florentine.  I got to go, actually.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  Yay!  Let's go.  What did we do to you?  They finally got to him. 
[02:29:30]  I got to bring a thunder somewhere else.  Oh, shit.  Where are you going?  No, I'm doing this new YouTube channel, a TV show with Sherrod Small.  Oh, Sherrod Small.  We're doing this thing called The Full Hoon.  We're making fun of, like, car clips.  So what are you doing?  So we're filming it today, and it's going to be on...  So film later.  We're doing something now.  I know.  We're doing something now.  It's a thing.  All right.  When do you have to leave?  Now.  That's fine.  Nine o'clock now?  Yeah, I got to go down.  We're filming a bunch of the shows today.  He's busy.  Where are you shooting at?  Down at some studio downtown. 
[02:30:00]  Down at some studio.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Jim, thanks for coming in.  It's like the Tosh show, but we'll make fun of car clips.  Quarantine has made it to that next level, Ant.  I like that.  The Johnny Carson thing where you can't stick around.  It's like when things to do, you know.  Like when, you know, the boys would come in.  Yeah.  You know?  When Dino would sit down.  It wasn't for the whole fucking show.  Bob Hope.  Bob Hope, he'd just come in.  Yeah, Johnny, I thought I'd just drop by.  Yeah, I got to go.  I'm opening in Vegas next week.  I got to fly out there.  I'm really, I just made that up.  I got to get out of this building before the thunder comes. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, you want to.  Keep your head down.  I got a kid now.  I got a family.  I don't need any thunder in my life.  The trees is what they hit mostly, so stay away from you.  You don't want to be on the elevator with Troy Quar.  That thunder goes off.  All the buttons go hoo-ha.  Oh, you'll be stuck in the elevator with a bunch of thunders.  You think Troy made a mistake today?  He most certainly did.  How did he ever?  Yes, exactly.  Bring the cocks from my mouth would have been less make fun of it than bring the fucking 
[02:31:00]  heavy metal thunder.  Every once in a while, someone makes a mistake.  Oh, boy.  Fucking B, bunch of O's.  That one's going to.  That one has stickability.  You think?  Heavy metal thunder.  Oh, yeah.  Heavy metal thunder's going to stick.  Yuck.  And Kenny came up with that?  Yeah, leave it to Kenny to bring it to the show.  Why are you mad at Kenny all of a sudden?  He's got your back always.  I'm just saying.  What's your problem with Kenny?  He's one of us busybodies.  He just gets in other people's business.  I'm the light man.  Oh.  I branded your show. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you.  Yeah, busybodies.  That's a nice name.  Yeah.  I like that.  So live up to the expectation.  Florentine brand.  Stop.  Let's get Florentine out of here.  He's a busy guy.  Bye, Jim.  Good appearance, Jim.  Friday, I'm your savior at the Producers Club, West 44th Street in New York City,  brownpapertickets.com.  I want to go, Jim.  I'm going to try to figure this shit out Friday.  And then the Relapse Theater in Atlanta doing the same thing on March 28th.  Yep.  All right?  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I'll see you guys.  Oh, and people get confused.  It's Mr. Jim Florentine on Twitter.  Yes. 
[02:32:00]  Because they're trying to find you today.  You've got a bunch of new ones.  M-R.  Oh, yeah.  Because, yeah.  The football shit.  They loved it.  They loved everything you did today.  Jim, thanks so much, man.  Always fun.  Sure.  I like heaven, Jim.  Not you.  Not you.  I just like compliments.  Look, hopefully next time I come on, I'll bring the thunder.  Bring that thunder.  If I brought it today, I'm happy.  Oh, bring the thunder.  There's going to be a lot of pressure next time.  Some hail.  Whatever you want.  Maybe some fog.  Bring the thunder.  Leave the cannoli. 
[02:32:30]  Uh-huh.  Turn the beat up.  Uh-huh.  Troy Kwan into his.  My main man, primetime.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm out there, Brooklyn.  Now I'm down in Tribeca.  Right next to De Niro.

Hey, yo, right there on Broadway.  Brought me back to that McDonald's.

Now I'm at that bedside.  Home of the boy Biggie.  Say what's up to Tata.  Sipping my ties.  Still courtside.  Nicks and nicks.  Give me high fives.  To the most definitely from New York.  Cockreet jungle where dreams are made of.

[02:35:00]  I like that.  Big ups to all my peeps.  And a big shout out to my personal producer, Troy Kwan.  And my inspirational producer, Primetime Sam Roberts.  What?  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Presents O and A Theater. 
[02:35:30]  Tonight's performance, Ray J. Johnson Jr.  Portrayed by James Norton.  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  There!  This has been O and A Theater.  Thank you, and have a pleasant evening.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Cause we're as cold as the Ice Roachers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies. 
[02:36:00]  Fuck it up, you're a tree  Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question 
[02:36:30]  Now we're talking  But the bitching wound  We got FCC complaints in front of us  Not for our show, that's been a long time since we had to worry about that, right?  We get FCC praise  That's right, they praise us on a daily basis, you're right  Y'all look good  Super Bowl complaints in front of us  Actual FCC complaints 
[02:37:00]  We used to have to read these on a regular basis  Yes, we did back in the day  And then the lawyers would get mad because we would laugh at some of the stuff  They wanted us to take it very seriously  So we wouldn't do the same type of crap at our radio show  Remember those days?  Oh god, pamphlets and folders  Go through some of these, please  Read this, read it and go  Yeah, it's obvious, shut up  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So what do we got here?  Oh my god, FCC complaints about the Super Bowl 
[02:37:30]  Remember, what was that, MIA?  Yep  Came out and  Gave the finger, that's it  She fucking flipped the bird  We've seen the bird by now  Yeah  Who cares?  It was nothing  It was a split second  You could barely see it again  Well, it didn't go unnoticed by some of the more astute and offended people in our grand nation  Because they felt compelled to write to the Federal Communications Commission  With their uninformed fucking dolt minds 
[02:38:00]  And try to get some kind of, try to get something done  They're trying to get something done  Clean up America  Damn it  Why is this one signed with Team Jordan 7, Captain Troy, Co-Captain Sandy, Team Players, Ashley, Kyle, Brooke, Tyler, and Ryan  I'm guessing that's the family  And Team Mascot  That's how this guy signed his complaint  That's a good family  They don't need to see that stuff  Sounds like a dollar  Oh, I disagree  I think he's a good person 
[02:38:30]  They sound great  Well, this guy writes  What's going on now?  Subject Super Bowl  I thought we agreed to clean up the halftime show  After the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction  Let's see  During the halftime show  One of the performers flipped us the bird  There were ads with scantily clad women  Drawing on themselves  Of which no one could tell what the product even was  Suggestive and provocative ads for cars  Underwear, candy, and more  The Super Bowl is run during primetime viewing hours 
[02:39:00]  Which I have always been under the impression  Was appropriate for children  Apparently not  If the FCC and the NFL cannot put forth  Family appropriate halftime shows and ads  Then I will have to take matters into my own hands  What does that even mean?  This asshole's speaking for all of us  Yeah  They're at halftime?  Speaking for all of us  Thank you, asshole  I host a family game party every year  That must be a hoot  Oh, that must be a hoot  Yeah  It's called  It's called  Kiss the eel 
[02:39:30]  Everybody puts on the fucking  They have to close their eyes  And kiss the eel  Until he spits  Thank God my father was cool  Thank God  This is a family game party  I host a family game party every year  And next year I can guarantee you  That I will not be showing the halftime show  Or any ads during the game  Yes, you will  And that's all in capital  Yes, you will  I will take a time out  And fast forward through all the millions of dollars  Your advertisers have spent  On their 60 seconds of ludity 
[02:40:00]  Ludity  What a douche  Signed  Team Jordan  Captain Troy  Coke  There are actually people out there  Like this fucking dickhead  And know what team represents?  Together, everyone achieves more  Oh, that's what team is  Yes  Well, you know what?  The halftime show is probably  I'm going to drink a bottle of bourbon  And blacken my wife's eye  Yeah  Exactly  Team should stand for something else  I just don't know what 
[02:40:30]  You know what?  Fuck your fucking children  All right  Yeah, Uncle Paul  Go get them  Sure  You know what it is?  If there's a halftime show  First of all, there's a football game  Where people are just destroying each other  And then a halftime show  Where some fucking chick flips the bird  And then commercials  Where there's a girl that maybe men  Real men  Not like you, you fucking asshole  But real men  Like to look at  Because they're attractive  Pretty girls  You know what?  Scantily clad  They're not naked 
[02:41:00]  Scantily clad  Like the Victoria's Secret commercials  And shit  Commercials  Guys like those  Real men  Like maybe you used to be  Before your wife fucking made you  The pussy piece of shit you are now  Trying to protect your dumb kids  Against what?  A Victoria's Secret ad?  What the fuck is the problem with it?  I don't think a guy like that  Ever enjoy that type of thing  Oh, please  This guy's in a fucking closet  Jacking his dick  Thinking of that  And being a parent  Because his fat fucking wife  Is so unattractive to look at 
[02:41:30]  And she's the one  Looking at the TV  And going  You gotta do something  Write to them  I'm offended  No, you're fat  And being a parent  Yes  The only parent on the show  Oh, yeah  Although maybe  You might have one out there  Nah  Let's be honest  You might have one  You might have one out there  No, no  You sure?  Positive  You sure?  Positive  Did I ever tell you  I think I might have  A 25 year old out there?  I have a weird feeling  About an incident in Rochester  Incident in Rochester  Can I hire a detective?  You probably don't want to 
[02:42:00]  Fucking make any waves  I have a weird  Let it sit  I just have this weird feeling  In the back of my head  Could it be after the  Hughes fortune in a second?  Can you imagine a 25 year old  Walk through that door?  Oh, boy  Dad?  Dad  There was a  There was a  There was a  You know  A liaison  A liaison  And then I went to Buffalo  Trist  Have I ever told a story  I went to Buffalo  And I came back for the  Park Avenue Festival  To be very local for  He live on Park Avenue  And

[02:43:00]  Or something, right?  Yeah  I'm sure, right?  Could have been some other dudes  Yeah, I don't know  What color was it?

And it's Mark Zuckerberg 
[02:43:30]  I said it the other way  And he's a great guy  You're right  Fuck  Who am I kidding?

[02:44:00]  And not one fucking  Mention of violence  In there either  Which I still love  I don't care  I don't think it's  Detrimental either  But it's that ludity  The nudity  The fucking  This fucking  Prude  I don't believe  Any of it is detrimental  As long as you sit down  With your fucking child  And explain shit  I don't understand it  Cause maybe they do  Go to their room  After seeing some violence  Or some nudity  Or something  And then their minds  Are rocking and rolling  And they're  No mine was  And they're a little  Confused and stuff  But if you sit down

[03:06:30]  Given  Five  Such  Amount  Edgar  Where  Where  Did  That  Love  Come  From  You're  An  Old  Man  Jimmy  Just  Starts  Cracking  Wow 
[03:07:00]  Edgar  Edgar  You  Gotta  I guess  We  Get  The  Gist  Of  This  One  Where  Did  You  Go  To  School  You don't read very well, Edgar.  I'm very careful.  No, you're not really.  I'm metallic.  Yes, I am.  I read every word.  No, you know what you're doing?  You're missing the lines.  These look delicious.  Have a premium salty crack.  No, no, no. 
[03:07:30]  I don't have a salty crack.  Oh, no.  Oh, because his teeth are dry in the first place.  I didn't even think of that.  No, he doesn't.  He's having a cracker right now.  He's getting some water.  That's not...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  The crumbs are just, like, falling out of his mouth here.  Shut up.  Oh.  Well, try to stay to the lines, though.  He's reading with crackers in his mouth.  Because obviously... 
[03:08:00]  The cracker's flying out of his mouth now.  I knew that was going to happen.  Nothing else really gets the attention of broadcasting executives.  This is a new low, but it will obviously be taken as a challenge for other performers who think so much of themselves yet. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, the crackers on his lips are fucking really disgusting.  They're just stuck there because his lips are dry.  Because it's all dry.  Yeah.  It's probably going to hurt to peel them off.  You can't lick his lips because his tongue is too short.  Oh, because his tongue is too short.  Or Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Anthony.  You know that.  If you were to take action, that would cause...  How long is this? 
[03:09:00]  And be Tobin.  This performer for life.  I hope it's 13 minutes longer.  And finally send a message that this type of...  12 now.  This type of beep...  What?  Doesn't pay.  Oh, crap.  He doesn't like saying curse words.  Money or publicity.  Edgar, you don't curse, huh?  No, I do not be.  There's pieces of cracker falling out of his mouth. 
[03:09:30]  Piss my mouth, Samuel.  People are begging for Chip.  Oh, I was just thinking...  They're begging for Chip at this point.  This whole read is grody.  Oh, no.  You suck.  I'm just saying, I don't like it.  You fucking suck, Sam.  Completely grody.  When are you going to stop allowing sexual-based ads?  I'm going to list them. 
[03:10:00]  One, GoDaddy painting what appears to be a nude model.  Oh, my God.  And also, the cloud.  Is this heaven cut to but not shown?  No, this is suggesting a nude.  Danica Patrick.  Oh, my God.  Danica, gag me with a spoon.  I can't even look at him.  I can't look at him.  Good.  Then why don't you just look left or right, but just not up and down, okay? 
[03:10:30]  What does that mean?  Why don't you gag your eyeballs?  What does that even mean?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Barf.  There's a guy.  He says, Edgar just made him run over a shopping cart.  Edgar's teeth are so grody.  Grody, huh?  They're as dry as lake beds. 
[03:11:00]  Valley gym.  Teleflora, Adriana Lima, given you shall receive insinuating sex, and she's also dressed very sexy.  That is so gaggable.  Gaggable.  H&M, David Beckman, gratuitous flesh shots.  Ugh, barf.  Fiat, horrible.  Pure sex-based whipped cream between girls' breasts.  Oh, my God.  On TV? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  That is so grody.  Grody.  And then you get the real gym.  Fuck yeah.  It's Luke Costello.  Kia, Adriana Lima, again, barely dressed, and rows of bikini-clad fans.  Who's watching this?  This is so gagging me with a spoon. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Camry reinvented couch with women in bikinis, then shirtless man.  Think not.  There's a guy saying this is more painful than gonorrhea treatment.  Yeah.  Well, he would know. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, wow.  I got him.  Shit.  Got him.  He got him.  Take that shovel head from Wisconsin.  Nailed him.  Yes, I did.  Don't have a cow over there.  Oh, he's having a cow.  These are offensive and should not have a place on a network.  Show that is designed to appeal to all age groups.  And what used to be considered a family-safe viewing time.  That's not a question.  Totally.  Yeah, everything is a question with Valley Gym. 
[03:13:00]  On a very positive note.  Thumb's up to Skechers.  Thumb's up to Skechers.  Yay.  Yay.  Who chose a cute dog to feature their shoes versus the 2-0-1-1 ad with Kim Kardashian on the floor in a sexual position with her trainer.  Oh, my God.  Get a spoon and give me a you-know-what gagging.  I wrote to the company and told them, protect our children and please censor these companies. 
[03:13:30]  There's no way that letter could be that long.  Oh, my God.  It is that long.  And there's no way that your eyeballs can be that crooked.  What needs to be noted in this letter, this guy actually thinks he made a difference.  Yeah.  Because he wrote to Skechers after the Kim Kardashian ad, they changed their ways.  I didn't know that.  Oh, you didn't hear that in there?  No.  They went with a cute dog instead of Kim Kardashian, and he feels that he did that because of the letter he wrote after the Kim Kardashian ad ad. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  I'm just surprised they didn't publish the letter that Ted Sheckler wrote.  Sam, you are definitely getting a beating thrown right at you.  Right between the eyes.  Yeah.  I think we're good.  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  You don't like Valley Gym?  I fucking hate Valley Gym. 
[03:14:30]  How many did you do there?  Who did Edgar?  Edgar, Chip, Valley Gym.  So I saw my ex recently, and she reminded me that when Edgar would help her take her shoe, like I forgot that Edgar would pull her pants.  Sometimes she'd wear tight whore pants, and she would go, could you help me get these off?  So when she'd lay back, and Edgar would try to help him, and she couldn't do it, and she'd fucking hate how weak he was, and he couldn't pull her pants off.  Oh, of course she would hate that.  I would annoy her all the way down the hallway because Edgar always had the keys. 
[03:15:00]  It would make her weight.  Walking gingerly and slow.  That's all.  She hated how Edgar...  What a pain in the ass.  Edgar's...  You don't like Valley Gym at all?  Oh.  There's nothing about Valley Gym that I like.  It's uncomfortable.  It's very uncomfortable, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  It makes people very uncomfortable.  Mm-hmm.  What?  What's the matter?  I know where you get your shit from.  I'm on to you, Sam Roberts. 
[03:15:30]  What shit?  You read it?  You read it?  Instigating shit?  Yeah.  Where did I get it from?  Somebody's feeding him instigating shit.  Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.  You can look at my computer monitor.  You can see it.  Uh-huh.  Did you read a text from Kenny?  No.  Kenny whispered in my ear...  Kenny wrote, Valley Gym should read one.  Yeah, he came in and whispered in my ear, Valley Gym should read one.  All right, we're on to you.  I thought that would make me a busybody if I ratted him out.  That's right, bitch.  What? 
[03:16:00]  Busybody.  Are we done?  Yes.  Five and a half.  Are you serious?  We have almost six minutes.  I don't even give a motherfucking shit.  We went late yesterday, and we're going to add the meeting time onto our show now.  Oh, my God.  You see, you're right.  They still have five minutes.  I know they do, and this is Barf City. 
[03:16:30]  Does Jim have any plugs?  Uh, yeah.  He's going to be at Vinny's or something this weekend.  Oh, God.  Uncle Vinny's?  Whose uncle he is?  I don't know.  People think you sound like great proops.  Oh, yeah?  In Point Pleasant?  I could hear that.  Yeah.  And then Caroline's on Broadway.  Hello, fancy.  How do you know this shit?  The 29th through the first.  How does he know how to talk like this?  It's how he talks.  It's Valley Jim. 
[03:17:00]  It's how I talk, okay?  It's natural.  How do you know how to put your shoes on?  Your turn.  Why'd you snap?  Because I felt like it.  I don't even know what that means.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops.  Turn it up.  Middle finger time.  And Caroline's the 29th of March through April 1st.  And the Cleveland trip is looking good for all of us?  Oh, good.  I think so. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah?  Unless you're just starting more fucking...  Well, I want to know.  You want to know.  Yeah.  It's on a need-to-know basis.  And you don't need to know.  That's right.  You don't need to yes either.  Hello.  I hate Valley Jim.  Don't hate Valley Jim because you can't valley with Jim.  You go mountain by Anthony.  You can mountain Anthony and I'll Valley Jim.  Valley Jim.  You put your head up in the clouds.  That makes no sense.  None of Valley Jim's things make sense. 
[03:18:00]  It makes dollars, not cents.  Oh, that makes...  No, it doesn't.  Valley Jim wouldn't have been popular when Valley Girl was.  Ow.  No.  Oh, good.  I'm glad you dropped your mouse.  I hope it gets some cheese.  Shut up.  It doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't.  None of it does.  It's just rambling babble.  Gawker has a tweet that says,  Which beloved comedian likes to force female comics to watch him jerk off? 
[03:18:30]  Oh, gee.  Wow.  Which guy would love to pull that off?  Jim Norton.  Beloved comedian loves to watch make-trivial comics.  Watching Jericho.  Beloved is very telling right there.  That's why I felt like I could read this.  I don't know.  It's not me.  I wish it was me.  Please.  I'm going to guess Voss.  Oh.  Oh, comedian.  They say who it is?  Male comedians are weird.  They jerk off all the time and then go on stage and talk about jerking off.  But our nation's most hilarious stand-up comic and critically cherished sitcom auteur adds a thrilling twist to his onanistic escapades. 
[03:19:00]  I'm going to guess Bob Saget.  He traps unsuspecting women in his hotel room and makes them stick around until he's done.  Sitcom.  We've heard from several sources that this shameless funny man whips it out at the most inopportune moments.  Oh, wait.  Wait.  They like giving their shit away by using words shameless. 
[03:19:30]  Shameless.  But there's no comedians on that show, is there?  Well, Louie had a special called Shameless, but that's not his vibe.  Well, I mean, it says nation's most hilarious and cherished sitcom.  So this guy had a really big sitcom.  Seinfeld.  Yeah, you got to pick Seinfeld.  Saget.  Saget.  Seinfeld?  No, not Seinfeld.  That is Seinfeld.  Keep reading.  I think.  Keep reading.  At the Aspen Comedy. 
[03:20:00]  Michael Richards.  At the Aspen Comedy Festival a few years ago, he invited a female comedy duo back to his room.  The two ladies gladly joined him and offered him some weed.  He turned it down but asked if it would be okay if he took his dick out.  Thinking he was joking, that's exactly the kind of thing this guy would say.  The women gave a facetious on Saget.  He wasn't joking.  Good for him.  When he actually started jerking off in front of them, the ladies decided that wasn't their 
[03:20:30]  bag and made the exit, but the comedian stood in front of the door, blocking their way with  his body until he was done.  Good boy.  One of the ladies was so shaken by the episode that she complained to the festival's organizers  about the queen.  She wasn't fucking bitches.  She wasn't shook up.  All he wanted to do was pull his dick out and not let you out of the room, you fucking  whore.  Do your act.  You weren't shook up.  Do your act on the balcony when he comes.  That's a bit weird.  Maybe, you know, maybe you openly laugh at the person, but you're not shook up by it. 
[03:21:00]  Come on.  What else?  And when we reached out to the extremely powerful manager, he put the comedian's publicist  in touch with us.  After a lengthy and detailed phone conversation, the publicist agreed to ask the comedian about  the incident.  Weeks went by and we heard nothing.  When we followed up with the publicist, he replied, sorry for the delay, but I never heard  back from him.  But it's our nation's most hilarious standup.  Why don't they have the balls to say the name? 
[03:21:30]  Right.  Say, this is what we're hearing about.  So-and-so.  I mean, I mean, Ray Romano.  Now, I mean, James, I in all those years on the circuit, I never heard anything about  those guys.  Saget.  But only the connection is because he, they said it sounds like the type of thing he would  say.  So Bob says dirty shit.  I think that they're pointing to Louie.  Yeah.  I don't think it's his vibe.  I think based on how we know, I don't think that's him at all.  He goes on a sitcom.  He's got, it's Louie. 
[03:22:00]  That's not really considered a sitcom.  Yeah.  I mean, they're ultra lucky Louie and this new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't think it's Louie.  It says critically cherished and that's what it is.  Yeah.  Oh, critically cherished.  Beloved?  No, I don't, I don't think that's Louie CK.  And nation's most hilarious standup is what every website.  Yeah.  But I don't, but.  But he was married a few years ago, right?  But I, I just, I just never, um, hold on.  What was that?  Nana?  But I don't, it just, Louie, I never struck me as that. 
[03:22:30]  Well, that's just it.  It's the surprising thing that you don't know about.  And they said shameless funny man.  Yeah, the word's shameless.  Yeah, that is pretty, uh, telling right there.  Well, not your sitcom, though.  I think more like the sitcom.  All right, I'm, I'm just going to go on record and say it's Louie.  I, I hope it's Louie.  Critically cherished sitcom.  I don't think I can love him anymore.  I'm putting a name to it.  Louie CK.  Auteur.  What's that?  Auteur.  I mean, that's, you know, that, that, that implies that he did more than just beyond.  So they're trying to knock him down lately, huh? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if it's him.  Knock him down a few notches.  We honestly.  I got to make peepees.  We honestly don't, you know.  I never make peepees before I leave, but I'll be doing the peepee dance in the, in the  truck if I don't go peepees.  Hey, guess what?  It's 10.01.  Why, I know.  Got you guys here late again.  Yeah, it never fails.  All right, kids.  You're working for the man, aren't you?  Start wearing a fucking tie.  Take it easy.  I'm working for the listeners.  No, you're working for the man.  Oh my God, wait a second.  I'll come with you.  All right, let's go touch our penis.  Nah, that is completely grody. 
[03:23:30]  The penis touching thing?  Let's go jerk off.  Sure.  You can't tell me twice.  I love pounding my pub with a friend.  I drop things at the urinal sometimes to sneak a look at the cocks.  You know, we're still on the air.  What's that?  Yeah.  No, we're not.  You're just kidding.  You're right. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know who that is.  Sounds like they're pointing to Louie.  I'm only thinking that because of the word shameless.  I thought of it when they said Nation's Most Hilarious Stand-Up Comic and Critically Cherished Sitcom.  Plus, Hilarious was the name of his other special.  Well, maybe. 
[03:24:30]  Well, if he did that, God bless him.  I'm rooting for him.  See you tomorrow.  Fuck.  Fuck.  The O.P. and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After 1A Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues. 
[03:25:00]  This is After 1A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right, all right.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I like that now we've gotten to a point where people have favorite Jim characters.  Like, it's not a matter of, I like when Jim does his characters.  I don't like when Jim does his characters.  People love some of them and then hate others. 
[03:25:30]  He's actually developed this entire independent group of people that people either like or dislike.  And they're all different from each other and they're all, they're all, we all find new things about them every time they come up.  Whether it's Edgar and his dry teeth who also happens to be very religious and doesn't like profanity.  You know, Uncle Paul, well, Uncle Paul just molests children.  Ted Sheckler we haven't heard from in quite a while. 
[03:26:00]  And Valley Jim is the newest addition to the bunch.  But people like Valley Jim but can't stand Chip.  Or they like Edgar but don't like Valley Jim.  It's amazing that this has happened.  To me, it starts where it's grating at first.  Like the first, I don't know, few minutes of Jim doing his characters and he only does them to bother people. 
[03:26:30]  He enjoys when people like them because he knows that that means that they're going to take those characters into their lives and bother the people around them.  He likes that.  He does the characters so people become bothered by them and angered by them.  Um, I, it's grating for me for the first, like, few minutes.  And then once you get past, I don't know what it is.  There's this intangible point that you have to get past with these characters. 
[03:27:00]  Once you get there, it's hilarious.  Everything is hilarious to me.  Once it's been going on for so long that you're saying this couldn't possibly still be going.  Especially with someone like Valley Jim.  Then it gets funny for me.  Sal, how come that lady's just looking at me?  She's just, like, looking at me like I'm doing something weird.  Like, it's a studio.  She's got a thing for you.  But she's looking at me like I'm doing something weird or wrong.  I'm waving.  Are they going to wave?  She's just looking at me. 
[03:27:30]  She didn't wave back.  She smiled.  Eric, do you have any idea who that is out there?  No, I don't.  It seems like they've been giving a tour, so.  I don't want them around anymore.  Can you take care of that?  No more tours while you're on?  No, those two specifically.  Those people I don't want getting in.  Why are you so paranoid?  She might be a fan of After O&A.  Because she's looking at me like I'm doing something wrong.  And then I wave to her and she just smiled.  You think she's judging you?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess everybody's welcome to judge me.  I just wish they'd be more open about it. 
[03:28:00]  Dan in Florida.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, everybody.  Hey, man.  Don't forget about Boardroom Jimmy.  That's got to be one of the best of all time.  Is that one your favorite?  Oh, yeah, man.  Boardroom Jimmy and Chip.  I can't fucking stand Valley Jim, dude.  You guys need to ban Valley Jim from the show.  I get fucking douche chills every time he does it.  But you like Chip?  Oh, of course, dude.  I like all those characters except for Valley Jim.  I can't even believe that he feels comfortable doing that. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, that's got to make him feel like way beyond uncomfortable doing that fucking voice.  It's just terrible.  Because there's somehow a realism that he brings to it where the irony kind of leaves it.  Like, you don't pick up on the fact that he's just a guy who's saying douchey things on purpose.  You just see this person who's saying douchey things.  Like, he's able to capture the douche essence so easily.  The character is irrelevant at this point.  I mean, it's just like so irrelevant. 
[03:29:00]  How did he even fucking come up with Valley Jim is what I want to know.  But it's crazy, man.  Hey, love the after show, dude.  Peace out.  Thank you, Dan.  It's completely irrelevant.  Like, why now would you decide to do a Valley character?  I think it's because he's spending more time in California and stuff.  And that's exactly what they sound like.  Still?  Oh, my God.  I thought that was done in, like, 91.  No, no, man.  Like, one of my best friends from college is from California.  And it is, yeah, man.  It's always, like, it's just, ugh. 
[03:29:30]  Does he say gag me with a spoon or grody?  But, yeah, he'll say stuff like that.  He'll drop, like, stupid fucking West Coast terms and stuff like that.  It's infuriating.  I forget, like, all these different, you know, they're obsessed with their weed out there and they have all these stupid terms for it.  Oh, my God.  We were in California and I was there with, you know, with the WonderCon people and I was hanging out with one of the guys who worked on it.  And on Saturday, we were just, it was just weird because I guess all the convention people, they also like to party with each other. 
[03:30:00]  So, like, the hotel lobby was full of weirdos drinking, like, a lot.  And first we were talking to these guys who were making their own rum in their hotel room or something.  And I was like, I don't like this scene.  Prison hooch in the toilet or something.  Yeah, I was like, why wouldn't you just buy some?  Like, why would you do that in 2012 at a bar?  Why would you make it?  And it was just weird.  And so I was like, I don't want to hang out here anymore.  So we start walking around and we're, like, at the downstairs level of the hotel. 
[03:30:30]  And this guy comes up to us and he goes, yeah, what's down here?  And we, I don't know, we just goofed on it.  And we're like, yeah, some gym over there, blah, blah, blah.  And all of a sudden, he starts talking to us.  And out of nowhere, he's talking to this kid I'm with.  And the kid goes, oh, yeah.  He says something about his bad back, right?  I have a bad back.  And the guy goes, do you have a medical referral?  Something like that.  I think that's the language he used.  And the kid I was with is like, like a doctor? 
[03:31:00]  Like, you need me to give you a doctor?  And he's like, no.  Like, for weed.  Yeah, yeah.  And we were like, oh, we're from the East Coast.  And this guy ends up talking to us for the next half hour.  He starts pulling bags and bags of weed out of his shirt.  Like, he's got, there's probably a pound and a half of weed that he's just pulling.  No, there are big bags of it.  Oh, he didn't have it?  Because I see a lot of times it comes in those, like, actual pill containers. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  He had, he had full, not like giant bags, not like freezer bags, but sandwich bags.  And he's pulling more and more.  He had like six sandwich bags full of weed.  Hey, man, you got a light headache?  Yeah, let's just go out to the car for a few minutes.  Yeah, and he was talking about all the times he's been pulled over.  He was talking about how, you know, I can't get arrested anymore because I have kids.  That's why I don't carry a gun.  And I'm like, in my head, I'm going like, this is a great thing to just see happen.  But I'm also thinking of all the ways this could go terribly wrong. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, especially when you're out of state.  I mean.  Yeah, this could not, this could go really bad.  Absolutely.  And, you know, he's like, you know, you can't sell to somebody who doesn't have a prescription or whatever.  And blah, blah, blah.  And we're just like sitting there.  And this guy is spilling his guts over all.  He's talking about all the times he got pulled over, every place in his car that he hides weed.  And we were like, well, it was 1230.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of Comic Con people running around upstairs.  And this guy who wasn't, he was in the bottom of the hotel for some reason. 
[03:32:30]  He didn't go back up.  He didn't go back into the lobby.  He was in that little gym level just wandering around with like a pound and a half of weed on him.  Short shorts and like a fag bag like with all his like.  No, he had like a windbreaker with pockets.  And I couldn't even tell.  The center pocket was obviously much bigger than I had anticipated because he just kept pulling more and more.  It was like he was doing a magic trick and, you know, pulling out one handkerchief after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other. 
[03:33:00]  He's just pulling another bag, another bag, another bag.  He's passing him around.  He's like, yeah, smell this, smell that.  I'm like, I don't know, man.  Oh, that's funny.  And then, like, after we ditched him, I was like, that was weird, dude.  And the guy I was with was like, no, man, that's California.  You just got to, you got to, that's the vibe out here.  And I was like, no.  Like, there's the vibe.  That's weird.  Well, I think it's weird to us because we think like, we're in New York.  We think, oh, it's a criminal offense immediately. 
[03:33:30]  But for them out there, it's, it's just a part of your everyday life.  Yeah.  But you can't be in a hotel with strangers pulling a pound and a half of weed and plastic bags out.  That guy's just an idiot.  But yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  And talking about your kids and that's why you don't carry guns on you.  And like, yeah.  What's your life?  He's, he thinks he's still in, in California pretty much, I guess.  And talking about like, you know, he was talking about the times he was arrested and spending time.  And we're like, you're a stranger, but you don't know who we are. 
[03:34:00]  We could be a cop for all he knows.  Like, absolutely.  I don't look cool.  I don't look like, you know, I'm one of those guys.  I don't know.  Why?  Have you spent time in California?  No.  I just have a lot of friends who are from the West Coast.  And, you know, I love them to death.  But they're, yeah, like Jimmy, like this persona that he's, he's created is like.  Valley Jim.  It's right on.  It's right on.  I mean, yeah, man, everything's so lax.  And, you know, they get seasonal depression because there's not enough fucking sunlight. 
[03:34:30]  Like, come on.  You know.  In California, they do?  There's plenty of sunlight.  Oh, yeah.  What?  One rainy day of the year?  No, no.  Like, my friends who are on the East Coast here going to school, they get a little upset in the wintertime.  Like, you know.  Like Troy said he did.  Right, right, yeah.  They have to get happy lamps so they can feel better.  One of my roommates, he had a happy lamp, whatever it is.  And they can't smoke as much weed as they could in California.  No, they have ways of.  I mean, you have to get around it.  You can't just be walking around with it anymore.  No, no.  But, yeah.  Good people, though.  I guess so. 
[03:35:00]  What's up, Megan?  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, did you mention Helen Bergeron?  Helen Bergeron is my favorite.  But she doesn't – because Helen Bergeron sounds just like my – one of my fiancée's grandmothers.  Like, that's how she talks.  She lives in the city, and that's exactly how she talks all the time.  But, I mean, Helen is kind of like the Nana voice that Jim does, but she's got a personality of her own.  And she doesn't really –  She's very feisty.  Yeah, she's very feisty. 
[03:35:30]  She doesn't come out much, though.  That's true.  Who's your favorite, Megan?  Isn't it – oh, my favorite's Ted.  But I was going to ask, doesn't he not do Ted as much because it hurts his throat?  Maybe.  I think he's said that a couple times.  Eric, do you have – first of all, do you have a boardroom, Jimmy?  We have something.  It's, like, short.  Yeah, the last time he did it was during, you know, the merger stuff.  Right.  Lookin', lookin', lookin'.  Give me one second.  I don't know. 
[03:36:00]  Maybe in the production piece we did.  That would probably do the trick.  Look, just to bring people up to speed as to the characters that Jim has done here on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know.  All right.  Boardroom, Jimmy.  The –  I know.  I got a bit that's just under five minutes.  We did – what about the production piece we did?  Hmm.  Lookin' for that.  Hold on.  Oh, Eric.  No, all I have is the worst of here.  I'm not seeing the production piece.  That's – because we did one, right? 
[03:36:30]  I think we did, yeah.  I'm sure we did.  Boardroom, Jimmy, we have to have.  And what was the other one?  I guess – I know you have – you've isolated everything Ted has ever done on this show.  Yes, I have a million things – because Ted's my favorite.  Yeah.  And then Uncle Paul is number two.  Well, what about this one?  Chris, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  What's up, guys?  I'd have to say my favorite is when Uncle Paul was on the after show and he was drunk and confessing everything that he's ever done.  Yeah, Uncle Paul gets really somber and direct when he's drunk. 
[03:37:00]  He's only done that the one time on the after show, though, right?  Right, yeah, but it was amazing.  I love hearing all the horrible things he's done.  Yeah.  Thanks, Chris.  Thanks.  I mean, he doesn't – Uncle Paul – I mean, as Uncle Paul has gone forward, there's less and less subtlety with the character.  But when he's drunk, there's absolutely none.  It's just straightforward, this is what I did.  You got it, Eric? 
[03:37:30]  I'm not finding that production piece at all.  Oh, Eric.  I'm just finding little short clips of Boardroom Jimmy.  Oh, this is a good one.  See if you can find this one.  All right.  Brian.  Hey, you guys.  This is really going back, but do you guys remember when Jim used to do Liddy?  G. Gordon – remember Liddy?  Yeah, let me see if I have that.  Yeah, find Liddy.  That was –  Yeah, find some Liddy.  I love it.  Have you been listening since we first got to Satellite?  Yeah, I mean, I think that week was the week I got XM.  Wow. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  Appreciate it.  You think the short's gotten better or worse?  No, he's off the phone.  That must mean better, right?  Yeah, let's find Liddy.  Let's give the people – because nobody, except for Eric, me, you, and Brian remember this guy.  Do you have Liddy?  I'm looking.  Hang on, hang on.  You got to have Liddy.  Everybody's chiming in now.  They like – well, somebody's chiming in saying they like Frank the Frowner, which I think Frank the Frowner kind of turned into Ted.  Jamaican Jimmy, that's another good one. 
[03:38:30]  He does voices.  This guy, he does these impersonations.  I swear you would think it was the real people.  It was G. Yogurt Liddy.  G. Yogurt Liddy.  Um, I'm not seeing anything isolated under him either.  Eric, what do you do back there all day?  Well, he didn't do it enough at that point to save his full day.  Well, I know that I've heard Yogurt Liddy before.  I don't know if there's production pieces or what, but there was a theme in 2004, 2005. 
[03:39:00]  Nothing for me.  Dude, I'm looking for it.  I don't see Yogurt Liddy isolated here.  I'm going to have to talk to Travis about your job performance.  All right, you do that.  Because it's not that great.  Everybody wants to hear Liddy.  Did you look up just the word Liddy?  Yes.  And nothing, huh?  I'm searching there, nothing.  No, G. Gordon Liddy comes up.  But that's –  But not G. Yogurt Liddy.  That's actually the guy.  We'll just play one of his things.  You're disappointing people. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  Because now everybody wants to hear Liddy.  Well, we didn't – I wasn't planning on this, so.  Let's fly by the seat of our pants here on After Open Anthony Live.  Let's do it, baby.  Nothing.  Nothing.  What do you got for me, then?  Give me a substitution.  Give me something.  I'm looking right now for you.  I'm trying to get some of the Frank the Frowner elevator clips for you.  Yeah, give me some of that, then.  I got to have something.  The people are sitting there.  We've whet their appetites to this extent, and now it's just like, huh. 
[03:40:00]  Okay, I have Frank the Frowner stepping on somebody's junk.  Okay.  You want that?  Yeah, that from the elevator?  Yeah.  Over on 57th Street.  We were talking about this a few days ago when we had a three-story elevator ride.  Frank the Frowner used to get on the elevator between the K-Rock and XM sides,  and this is what it used to sound like.  Where is that music coming from?  Is that from the elevator? 
[03:40:30]  Oh, one person gets off, one gets on.  Oh, well.  Excuse me, you're standing, like, directly on my junk.  Could you give me an inch?  Oh, I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't realize I was on your junk.  I apologize.  You should have pressed it against my supple backside.  That was like, you have to understand, this is, the microphone was hidden, obviously,  and this was in an elevator full of business people. 
[03:41:00]  They were just trying to get to work, and you got this maniac doing the Frank the Frowner voice.  What else?  Do you have more Frank the Frowner?  Yeah, he was singing karaoke one night at FH Riley's.  Yeah.  And he was singing Happy Together, if you want to hear that.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Did you know, it takes more muscles to drown than it does to smile.  I once ran on the inside of Adam Walsh's back.  Oh.  Where was this? 
[03:41:30]  FH Riley's.  You have any more elevator clips?  I thought everybody was in on this.  I thought everybody was so happy together.  Nicole from the Morning Mashup is here.  First of all, why are you all, you look so lonely in here.  Because, I mean, the audience are the people I'm with right now.  It also needs a good once-over in here.  It smells like dude.  Like, like dirty dude.  I mean, there's a lot.  Do you smell it, Ron and Fezzin, turn? 
[03:42:00]  I don't smell it.  Yeah, well, that's because you're a dude.  I guess so.  There's a lot of flatulating that goes on in here.  It's pretty gross in here right now, and I don't really want to stay very long.  A lot of egg-eating, things like that, that just really, fragrant smells all the time.  Have you gotten to see Jim do his characters?  I have not.  Have you?  You've never heard them?  No.  Oh, there was one that called in when I was here talking to Opie.  Remember he called and he was a creep asking me to do disgusting things?  That was probably Chip. 
[03:42:30]  It was Chip.  It was Chip.  Yeah, so you've heard Chip.  Chip, I do not.  I'm not a fan of Chip.  What do you got?  What do you got for her, Eric?  What is this?  Annie Dana.  I'm having difficulty.  Eric's having, it's a fly by the seat of our pants day.  Not every character was isolated because he'd only do it for a long time.  He didn't have G-Yogurt litty for me.  No.  He didn't, he doesn't have, what happened to the rest of the elevator clips?  Uh, the other ones that I have here, um, are mostly just Jim on the phone saying horrible  things to people while they're in the elevator. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, that's abnormal.  Never heard him do that before.  You want to hear one of those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is on, this is again, on the public elevator.  There you go.  Oh.  No, I told him the same thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, shh.  It's not going to happen.  What am I going to do?  I told her she's usually going to get pregnant, so what am I going to do?  I mean, she's going to have it.  I just hit her in the stomach.  I'm not having a kid.  You know, am I going to throw, I kick her around, and if she wants to have it, then  let her have it if it's, uh, if it's, uh, if I'm wrong with the kid, I'll just punch 
[03:43:30]  it, too.  Oh.  I don't care.  It doesn't matter to me.  She's fat.  I don't like pregnant.  Oh.  I threw her along.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  I told her.  She knows.  She knows she's fat.  You're going to get fat with that kid.  The old whoopsie-daisy.  The old Doc Martin likes his belly.  That's all.  I can't wait.  So there's people in the elevator that think that he's going to kick the woman that he  got pregnant? 
[03:44:00]  In the stomach.  And get rid of it?  Yeah.  Well, what you missed is Jimmy's pretending to be on the phone.  As he walked in, he just went shush to everybody in the elevator and then continued his phone  calling.  Wait, did this recently happen?  No.  This was over when we were on 57th Street.  Not in this elevator, but it's-  That's really horrible.  What would you-  If you're in the elevator and you're hearing this, this is the side of the conversation you're  hearing.  I'd say, listen, douchebag.  Would you say something?  I'd almost want to call the cops on him.  Because you don't want spousal abuse.  No.  Would you actually say something? 
[03:44:30]  I might, because I'm kind of a loud mouth.  I might.  But you're-  Let's say you're working, you know, you're just some schlub who's working in a cubicle  upstairs from a radio station.  I would be scared.  I'd try to get off the elevator as much as possible.  You're getting too-  Because we were floor three.  This is a slow elevator.  Yeah.  Clearly, you had a lot of time to get up to floor three.  So you'd probably say something.  I think I'd have to.  He might knock me out, literally, but-  Do you speak up when you're annoyed with people in public?  Yeah, I do.  Even when you're with your fiance?  Yeah, and then he gets mad at me for saying something. 
[03:45:00]  He gets very awkward.  Well, do you know, but do you know that if you start a fight with somebody, that's going  to be his fight to fight?  100%.  That's right.  You don't mind that.  I don't give two shits.  Because I've had to tell Jess, listen, knock it off.  Because.  Because I'm not going to-  Yeah, and I'm not going to do it.  No.  You come in peace.  Yeah.  You're not a fighter.  You're a lover.  That's what I wish more people realized about me.  Yeah.  I got you.  Troy got into a thing with Club Soda Kenny today.  There's been some tension.  Well, Kenny has been, of course, he started the- 
[03:45:30]  renaming the show.  What's the new name of the show?  He told me this, too, and I asked if it was true.  Busy Buddies?  The Busy Buddies show.  That you get up in everybody's business.  Right.  Yeah.  And he started telling everybody that Troy and I were doing the show together.  I believed it.  I just want you to know that.  I totally, 100% believed it.  Because nobody sits there and says to themselves, well, this giant of a man is just lying to me  for no reason.  No.  He said it with a straight face.  Usually, the heckle and jekyll is that?  Well, you see, we found out the sound effect was played when you came in, Troy. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Nicole looked at me like, what the fuck?  That was very scary.  Did you feel like Troy was bringing the thunder?  You were bringing the thunder.  Is that what that's for?  Well, so what happened today was, you know, Kenny's been pushing this agenda, the Busy  Buddy show, and he's been talking about it.  He's been coming on the air and saying, hey, did you hear about Sam's new show?  The Busy Buddy show?  And blah, blah, blah.  And nobody gets what he's saying at first.  And then, you know, whatever.  Everybody realizes it's just Kenny being dumb again. 
[03:46:30]  Right.  But today, Troy, and by the way, Troy, and I don't know if you could tell based on the  conversation that I started on the air, I wasn't having any part of that argument because  I knew it was just a road that led to nowhere.  Yeah, but I was-  A lot of noise going on in here.  That's the after show.  Yeah, don't, that's how it's supposed to be?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  Keep it up.  Go ahead, Troy.  Sorry.  No, I was willing to get into it.  Yeah.  Because I like that.  I like talking music, so.  Because I knew, because what happened was Jim Florentine was in here, and he's a big 
[03:47:00]  metal guy, and he said some, like, blanket statement about how hip-hop and rap have not  evolved at all.  All the lyrics are the same.  And, you know, and I knew, looking at him, that he wasn't a guy who ever listens to any  rap music, and that he just listens to metal.  So I was like, wow, this isn't even a conversation I'm going to have.  And he's sort of from the old school of, like, metal, it's not cool if you're a metal  head to, like, rap.  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  Because that's sort of, like, old school.  Like, back in the day, that's just the way it was. 
[03:47:30]  I mean, nowadays, young kids are into everything, really.  So Troy came in, and he was kind of saying it a little bit, but, I mean, Opie, Anthony,  and Jim, you know, they haven't heard, like, N-Words in Paris.  You know that song?  Yes, I do know that song.  It's a big song, right?  It's huge.  They said-  Katie Carey actually just covered it.  I know.  That's what we were playing on the show today.  Yeah.  And she was, you know, she was really ballsy enough to say ninjas in Paris.  Wow.  That's what Stanley T. from the Mashable always tells us to say.  Say ninjas.  Don't say the other one.  It's the same shit. 
[03:48:00]  It's just so stupid.  It means the same thing.  Yeah, but you should just say niggas.  That's the word.  Yeah, but then how come they've got the GGs starred out on, like, most, like, radio screens?  It's just, it's so stupid that that word is taboo at this point.  Well, it's not a nice word.  No, no, no, calling somebody a nigger is a bad thing, but nigga has become part of our  just slang vocabulary.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  That scared me, too, actually. 
[03:48:30]  Just jump down my seat, do it again, and I'm going to have your head.  Troy just brought the thunder on you.  Did you not get that?  What happened today was Kenny came in and announced that Troy was bringing the thunder.  Heavy metal thunder.  Which apparently Troy went on his Twitter, because he does a show on liquid metal, and  said, catch me on liquid metal on this time, bringing the heavy metal thunder.  Oh, so he was making fun.  Stop with the stupid thunder.  And so they're making fun of him a lot, you know?  It was like a goof that I said, you know, like, heavy metal thunder is such a 70s metal 
[03:49:00]  Bring the thunder.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So I tweet it just as, like, instead of saying, hey, tune into my show, you just try to mix  it up and say something.  But so you wish more people used the N word with the A at the end?  Yeah.  You like it?  I love it.  I hate it.  I love it.  I rap all my favorite rap songs when I'm at home.  Like, what's your favorite Jay-Z Kanye West song right now?  Oh, Niggas in Paris.  You like that one?  Yeah.  You're a rapper now?  What's your favorite rap group of all time? 
[03:49:30]  Oh, NWA.  NWA?  Yeah.  What's that?  Niggas with Attitude.  Oh, I understand.  Oh, weird.  I understand.  That's weird.  How did we get from Kenny doing the Busy Buddies show to this?  Because you could say I'm slipping all over the place.  That's what I do.  Yeah.  I mean, do you have the worst ADD ever in the whole entire world?  No, you go from topic to topic and see what sticks.  That's what the after show is, Nicole.  My bad.  Kenny's on the hotline.  What's up, Kenny?  Oh, no.  Hey, Nicole.  Thank you for being the first guest on the Busy Buddies show with Sam and Troy. 
[03:50:00]  You're welcome.  Anything I can do to help out some buddies.  I'm keeping you on a time limit, Kenny.  The Busy Buddies show is in effect.  And my parting comment will be, dumb equals entertainment.  Goodbye.  People need to get up on that.  Dumb equals entertainment.  I don't know what that means, but whatever.  It means that Kenny can come in here and be dumb.  Oh.  But guess what?  It's entertaining.  Folks are going to be entertained.  All right.  Listen, I love you so much.  Hang on.  But I have to go.  Before you go.  You don't have to go. 
[03:50:30]  You got nothing going on.  No, but it really smells like dirty dude in here.  Hang on.  Fred, you wanted to say something to Nicole.  Yeah, Nicole, you're a fucking hoe.  Oh.  I've never come back on this show.  Okay, well, I was just trying to leave.  Oh, Fred.  There's a reason why I don't listen to anything but XM Radio and this channel, pretty much,  because XM Radio is full of assholes like you.  I'm so sorry for being a fucking hoe, dude.  I'm leaving now, just for you.  Bye, hoe.  Bye, hoe.  No, Nicole, don't give in to Fred.  You guys have such sweet listeners. 
[03:51:00]  I know.  Compared to mine.  It's a great audience.  What's going on with you and your fiancé?  Has he been coming in your eyes?  No.  Not anymore?  No, we've been pretty standard.  Missionary?  Yeah, it's been pretty standard because we're just so wrapped up in all the planning that  we just don't have time to get creative.  You still have time to slip it in.  Yeah, definitely.  Good, good.  You have to get it in.  Yeah.  How many times per week?  A few.  How many?  Three.  Three.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm busy, dude.  I know.  I got a job.  I got things going on outside of here.  Yeah.  I'm planning the wedding. 
[03:51:30]  I'm trying not to break up.  You know, there's things that...  Try not to sit on some new penis.  There you go.  Try not to sit on some new penis.  How is that?  Because you went on the Opie and Anthony show recently and you said that your wedding  planning was a little nerve-wracking because you were worried about all the penis that  you weren't going to get.  I think he's worried about the same thing, though.  He's also worried about not getting penis.  He's worried about not getting, you know, vagina.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's worried about being with just me forever.  It's scary.  It's a scary thing.  It's boring. 
[03:52:00]  It's boring.  It is so boring.  You crave some strange, right?  A hundred percent.  And I love him to death, but I mean...  How many...  They're going to...  Either they're going to get divorced within two years...  You're going to give it two?  ...or they're going to be swingers.  How many penises have you held?  I would never tell you that.  Ever.  More or less.  More or less.  Ever in a million years ever tell you that.  How many digits?  Triple digits?  I'm not going to tell you.  Nicole was wild in college.  I was definitely wild.  Oh, yeah.  I'm wild.  The wildest.  But I would never tell you that number.  You told us one story about you going on a beach in Mexico and having a three-way on 
[03:52:30]  the beach.  Yes.  That's awesome.  That is hot.  Well, some guy just watched.  Well, we didn't know he was watching.  He was some Mexican dude.  We don't need to go back there.  Well, what other type of stuff did you do in college?  Miss, I was so wild.  I was wild.  I just was...  Did you try DP?  No.  You've never had double penetration?  Ow.  Ow.  No.  I don't.  No.  That I will not know.  You don't have anal sex?  That is not what you just asked me.  Okay.  But DP is not happening. 
[03:53:00]  Because...  But you've had a threesome and you take it in the can.  So why not?  Yeah.  No.  I know.  You've had two guys at one time?  No.  I don't like that.  Only a guy and a girl.  You've never had a three-way with two guys?  No.  Two guys.  I don't like that.  I feel like overpowered.  You have a munch box?  Yes.  But I feel very...  I feel very...  Like I don't have any control if there's two guys.  I wouldn't like that.  I don't like that.  You just wouldn't want to be bamboozled?  I would not want to be bamboozled.  You seem like a bamboozled kind of gal.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks so much, Troy.  No, no, no.  You know what I mean?  In a good way.  In a good way.  There's never part of you that like while you're getting banged is like, I wish there was one in 
[03:53:30]  my mouth.  No.  Definitely not.  Never.  I'm sorry.  I'm not a porn star.  You ever ski two dudes?  What are all these weird...  I'm assuming with the poles.  You understand.  Oh, no.  If I haven't been with two guys and I obviously haven't skied.  Well, not fucking them, but you may have had two dicks there.  No, I didn't.  You never gave two guys handjobs simultaneously?  No.  Would you?  I mean, I'm a hoe like the guy said before, but not that much of a hoe.  You ever fucked a dude and then went and fucked another dude without cleaning up?  No.  Have you ever been part of that like one after the other situation? 
[03:54:00]  No.  Oh, my goodness.  What's the most number of different guys you've been with in one day?  A 24-hour period.  Yeah, 24 hours.  One.  Nah, bullshit.  Nah, that's bullshit.  I'm leaving now.  Hang on.  Wait, wait, wait.  One more caller.  Is he going to call me a hoe?  Pirate trucker.  That dude, Frank, is a fag.  Nicole rules.  Thank you.  We need more pictures of you and another chick, though.  All right.  Let me see if I can stir up a few pics.  I agree with that.  Now, what part of being with other chicks do you like? 
[03:54:30]  It's different.  Women are beautiful.  No, I mean, which action specifically?  You just like kissing?  I like it all.  I don't have a specific thing.  I just like the whole thing, that it's like, that it feels wrong.  Do you?  Oh, that's right.  You like the naughtiness out of it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you like the act of going down on them or them going down on you?  Well, obviously.  I mean, selfishly me.  Oh.  But you'll go down on them.  Yes, of course.  Because it's naughty.  It's very naughty.  I'm leaving now.  Do you?  One more question.  For them. 
[03:55:00]  Yes.  Not for you.  For them.  So it's not too personal.  Right.  Do you prefer them to be shaven or not?  Don't, don't.  There's, we're not doing a fro here.  That's done.  There should be zero hair.  So you'll go, as Bobo would say, deep sea diving, but not as Bobo would say, muff diving.  Is that what he says?  He says deep sea diving.  Oh, my God.  Where has Bobo been?  Don't worry about it.  Don't even, it doesn't matter.  All right.  Well, good day.  I hope you have a lovely day.  Just going to find some chick to go down on or something?  I'm just going to go find some chick to go down on.  After you're married, will your fiancee then husband be okay with you hooking up with girls? 
[03:55:30]  Not if he's not involved.  Would you do a threesome with him?  We've discussed it.  And?  With another chick?  The verdict is out.  And you're going to let, you haven't decided yet?  We have not decided.  Are you going to let him fuck another chick in front of you?  No.  Why?  Even in a threesome situation?  No.  So what would he, what would, the other, the other girl would just be there for you?  Really is, that's what's really going on.  That's fucking lame.  Let him stick it in.  She could give him a blowie maybe.  No.  Yeah, a blowie is that?  No.  And would you put a finger up his ass while she gave him a blowie?  No.  Would you? 
[03:56:00]  No.  You wouldn't?  He's not into fingers in his ass.  Have you put one in there?  I, I'm leaving now.  Have you?  I'm not.  Put one in there?  No.  Nicole, be clear.  Well then how do you know what he's into or not?  I just don't think, every time I try to go near there he clenches.  Do me a favor.  I can't.  He doesn't like it.  Before you get married, because you need to know these things.  That's right.  Stick a finger in his ass?  You need to know these things before you get married.  While you're being intimate, just poke a finger up there and see what he, you know  what I mean?  Say, get the homophobia out of here.  All right.  I don't think it's homophobia.  I just don't even put a tongue.  He's taking a tongue there, right?  He's very scared of things near his ass. 
[03:56:30]  He hasn't taken a tongue up there?  Not from me.  I'm not putting my tongue there.  You're not going to.  You're just, well put a finger up there to test the waters then and smell under your fingernail  to see if it's a place that you would put your tongue.  I haven't even had my breakfast yet.  I bet you're about to.  Jesus.  No, I'm not.  What are those other?  I lost my appetite.  Mashup chicks.  Let them stick it in.  Don't be a pussy.  I hate that shit.  What?  It's like if you're going to have a threesome, it's like let the dude stick it in.  Yeah.  This prude Nicole. 
[03:57:00]  See, that's what, when you bring in Nicole, you talk to her a little bit of, and then it  has to get to her telling some crazy ass sex stories because otherwise.  Part of her is really sexy and part of her is just like, ugh.  Like, like there'd be a lot to, a lot of, a lot to fucking deal with for this payoff.  Bullshit.  Bullshit to fucking deal with.  Like a lot of, like you'd have to think a lot of, like a lot of stuff was funny that's  not funny.  I'm going to tell you what kind of chick she's like.  She's the kind of chick that you meet and you're out and she's just talking shit. 
[03:57:30]  She's like, yeah, we're going to fuck chicks.  Yeah.  I'm going to fucking do this.  I'm going to do that.  I'm going to let you fucking blast in my face.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then you put a ring on that bitch's finger and all of a sudden all that shit fucking stops.  You think so?  Yes.  She's not going to be crazy when she gets the ring on her finger.  Ew.  But do you think she'll be crazy with someone else?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Because she's going to let it fucking out.  With someone else who's not her husband?  Yes.  Wow.  Somebody who works here?  Dude, I don't know.  Could it be though?  I don't know.  Potentially.  Who knows? 
[03:58:00]  Don't look at me.  Why are you pointing at me, motherfucker?  I ain't going there.  That's way too much drama.  Motherfuckers want to find me.  First.  Yeah?  Roland.  Still, I liked it today.  They called you out on Linsanity, said it's over.  Roland's got a bunch of bullshit t-shirts that he can't wear anymore.  Yeah.  And what'd you do?  I fucking wore my Linsanity jersey.  You came in here and you said, fuck the world.  It's still Linsanity.  It's still Linsanity.  24-7, 365. 
[03:58:30]  Are you watching Knicks games yet or no?  I watch them all the time.  You do?  Because you're a Linsanity.  What do you think?  The Siffas and I saw The Sitter.  How was The Sitter?  It wasn't bad.  It was pretty funny.  Was it?  Yeah.  It wasn't too bad.  You like Linsanity?  You still like, you like Jeremy Linsanity?  Yeah.  Or you like Carmelo Anthony?  Carmelo who?  I have a Linsanity.  I see.  And that's where you got the shirt from.  Is there a part of you that got a little worried, though, after Lynn started losing games and  people started losing interest?  I've been an L.A. sports fan for years, so I'm not worried about nothing. 
[03:59:00]  There's a lot of downs.  Then we became football orphans.  It's a roller coaster, right?  It's a roller coaster.  No more high-fives in the subway, though.  No, more like, you're the douche who bought one.  You still have that shirt?  Yeah.  You still make those?  I know.  That's why I'm right now.  No more high-fives.  No.  Even the person I saw gave me the high-five, like, looked at me disgust this morning.  Oh, the same guy?  The same Wall Street.  And you looked at him and you said, I know you would have given me a high-five. 
[03:59:30]  I was like, I hope you fall on the tracks.  That's what he said to you?  No, I was just thinking that, but then I go, wait, the 7 train may not run for another  fucking day.  Fucking MTA, people.  You're getting tired of this subway shit.  It's bullshit.  Yeah?  They shut down on Friday, Monday morning's supposed to work, doesn't work.  You used to live right close to everything, a cab ride away, and now you're a little further  away and you're finding out the subways are not all they're cracked up to be.  No, it's bullshit.  You think it's Bloomberg?  Fuck him, too. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, it's MTA.  All the money you spend, and then you go in the subway early.  Everybody's asleep.  You're like, how can people sleep on the subway?  Yeah.  I just want to scare a person so bad.  Have you done it yet?  No, I just look empty.  It's just like one guy snoring.  I go, ah!  They wake up and see you.  I don't know.  Troy, have you spoken to Kenny off the air lately?  He has been, this week.  He's on fire.  Yeah, it's like he's all sugared up or something.  I don't know what's going on. 
[04:00:30]  He goes through.  He's nuts.  He was coughing this morning.  Yeah.  Firing at full cylinders.  Although, I will tell you this.  Kenny is another, like you said, L.A. sports fans, it's a roller coaster, ups and downs, ebbs and flows.  That's how Kenny works, too.  And Kenny's been off the air for a while.  He comes on strong.  But if he starts getting too confident, you know, is this going to be able to last?  Because I think he will all this week.  He's been, this week he's been on fire.  But what brought up the whole thing with you and I?  Why does all of a sudden he starts texting us shit and then coming on there to talk shit? 
[04:01:00]  Like, what the, what, what, why are this now?  I don't know.  It was after we did that whole week where it was like, first we were blasting on Eric, we were blasting on you.  I don't even remember anymore.  I think we did something with Roland one day.  That's how quickly it escapes my head.  But one of those days.  So why did he have a problem with that?  He just, especially not only why did he have a problem with that, but how are, is he not the busybody when he's over here bringing it up? 
[04:01:30]  He's the one who's bringing it all up.  Yeah.  Like he's the one who's not letting anything just.  And just start shit with it.  He starts shit with it.  Everybody talks to everybody going down the hall having to start shit.  He was, and he was on your case today when you were in here.  Do you think he made it more difficult for you to have an actual discussion about what you intended to discuss?  Well, completely.  It completely derailed the conversation I wanted to have.  It frustrated you a little bit.  But Troy was hilarious though.  Why do you say that?  Thunder.  And then he brings that up.  Yeah.  And you know that's your new shit now. 
[04:02:00]  Well, it's fine.  It's fine.  That's, that's not a bad thing.  Yeah.  My degree is your Nickelback sucks donkey balls.  Yeah.  I don't know what, what, what.  Who likes Nickelback?  Exactly.  Florentine brought up Nickelback at one point.  And you were like.  Yeah.  I mean, dude, I like having music discussions like that.  Right.  Especially, you know, having to do, because everything that Florentine was saying about metal, or saying about rap, it could be completely converted over to metal.  Yeah.  So it was, you know, I had to jump in. 
[04:02:30]  And I love niggas in Paris, so.  Is that the song you like?  Yes.  You love saying that word so much.  Well, because it's like, it's so, it's silly that it's taboo, that you can't, everybody has to cringe and you have to censor it out.  And it's like, that's the name of the song.  Sam, can I say it?  Yeah.  We take care of our own.  That's your song.  That's my song.  Yeah.  There's a, there's, you know, some people like rap, some people like metal, some people just listen to Bruce records all the time.  But, Roland, does Bruce ever use the N-word?  I don't know.  I don't know every song. 
[04:03:00]  No.  So, Troy, you must have a little bit of a problem with that.  I don't, it's not a thing if you don't use it.  It's fine.  But you prefer it if he does.  I mean, if he did, it'd be fine.  Would you like it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like that?  If, if, if Bruce Springsteen's walking around, you say a nigga in his songs?  Yeah.  I think that was great.  Yeah.  Fucking awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love it.  Well, listen, uh, Ron and Fez have a lot going on today, so we gotta make way for them.  Stay tuned.  They're coming up next.  We'll be back with more-  Do I owe you lunch? 
[04:03:30]  Huh?  Do I owe you lunch?  Yeah, you do owe me.  You fucking bastard.  You owe me, though.  You and your fucking MTAs.  You may, no, you all, you can't be mad at the MTA, because yesterday you were in a bit of a mood.  And-  It's an MTA.  And what happened was, I called-  Fuck the MTA.  Because Roland thought he had a guest for me for my Sunday show or for the after show, and it didn't come through.  It came through for this show tomorrow.  Right.  Oh, he's coming in?  Chris Jericho's coming in tomorrow?  Yeah, tomorrow.  That's very exciting.  I love seeing Chris Jericho.  But I guess Roland thought we were gonna get him later and tape him for another time.  Yeah, my bad.  But his schedule changed, and it was part of the deal we made. 
[04:04:00]  And once Roland said, he's not coming in, I said, wait, you made a deal that he was, then he got pissed at me.  Dude, Travis reminded me.  Yeah, Travis reminded me.  He got pissed at me, but I knew that he was pissed at something else.  And I guess you were just still mad about the subways?  Yes!  It's ridiculous.  Stay tuned.  And Ron and Fez are coming up next, and we'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Yeah, you lick my balls.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
