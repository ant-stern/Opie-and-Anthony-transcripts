<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a botched radio bit involving Chip, a recurring character, and the unexpected absence of sound engineer E-Rock, which disrupted their planned segment on Anthony Weiner.  This transitioned into a phone call with Bruce Mittman, a long-time associate from their Boston days.  Mittman shared numerous behind-the-scenes anecdotes about their past exploits, including various stunts, on-air antics, legal run-ins, and the creation of a novelty check for "the Shwoogies." He detailed the efforts he made to manage the fallout from their controversial actions and even revealed that his children were sometimes left unsupervised in the studio.

Following the call with Mittman, the show moved into a critique of contemporary rap music, specifically targeting lyrical content and repetitive themes.  The hosts, using racial slurs and explicit language, played and dissected songs by Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Robin Thicke, and T.I., focusing heavily on the use of the N-word in Jay-Z's "Fuck With Me You Know I Got It." This segment featured in-studio guests Josh Gad and Ty West.

The next segment, a "Worst of the Week Countdown" hosted by Sam Roberts, featured an interview with Ty West, discussing his dual film releases, "You're Next" and "Drinking Buddies," his past in a band called "Guns and Sunflowers," and his experiences in the horror film industry. The segment also included discussions of Anthony's upcoming veneer procedure, the cancelled appearance of Natasha Lyonne,  a review of the documentary *Active Killing*, and a highly inappropriate farewell to intern Jackie, involving suggestive comments about her and her mother.  There was also praise for *The Wire* and discussion of movie trailers.

The departure of intern Jackie was the central theme of another segment.  The hosts' initial discussion about treating interns better was quickly overshadowed by Jackie's farewell cake with a mean inscription, Ryan Starr's head-shaving and impromptu serenade, and further sexually suggestive comments about Jackie and her mother. Sam's perceived mistreatment as an intern and discussions of other former interns were also included. Starr's new EP, *Animals*, and its music video with a "steamy pool scene" were also discussed.  This segment included a countdown highlighting Anthony's recent run-in with tollbooth workers, resulting in three traffic tickets, and a clip of Josh Gad discussing his roles in *Jobs* and the upcoming Sam Kinison biopic.

A significant portion of the show focused on Anthony's ongoing feud with a "ginger lookingâ€¦Irish prick" Bridge and Tunnel Officer (BTO), involving multiple encounters, alleged harassment, and petty ticketing. Anthony detailed his plans to use GoPro footage to document future interactions.  The discussion escalated into highly profane and racially charged language.  This section featured guests Robert Kelly, Danny LaBelle, Dan "Soda" Soder, and Greer Barnes, who discussed their careers, personal lives, and various comedic anecdotes, including a confrontation between Louis J. Gomez and a comedy club patron. A fan sent gifts, including a giant hat, to the hosts and guests.

The final segment involved more in-studio banter and a discussion of gifts received, including chips, Rice Krispie Treats (suspected to contain weed), and a hat. This led to arguments between the hosts over the unequal distribution of gifts and devolved into insults and name-calling. The conversation then shifted to graphic details about one host's constipated child's bowel movement, followed by numerous sexually suggestive remarks about intern Rotem. The show concluded with a discussion of a recent comedy show at Foxwoods, featuring Kelly and Louis J. Gomez,  critique of Kelly's performance style, and further insults and joking between the hosts.  The distribution of posters designed by Howard Porter, a Marvel Comics artist, at the Foxwoods show, also fueled further conflict.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, Sam, help me. Oh, no. Help me. I get that at the break right now. Help me, Lord Jesus.  Sal, the audience was not aware that E-Rock wasn't behind the board.  What do you think? This is fucking Imus at the Ranch video?  We just came back from break. Why would I say that?  Oh, my God. He doesn't even know the bits. I know the bit. I'm just kidding.  I don't understand. No, you're not kidding. No, I know the bit.  I didn't cover your track. What? Why would I dive onto the ice cream?  Sam, break this down. All right. Break the whole fucking thing down.  Here's what happens. I put on my arms, signing to Jim, saying that it was me, not E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  I'm here. He knows that. What difference does it possibly make?  Oh, well, in that case... This is just as bad as the other kid, who I don't know his name,  goes, I can't dive across the table and take out the fucking blizzards because there's a lot of cameras around.  And then he goes, well, we just got back from break. And you go, that's the bit.  And he goes, oh, no, I know. I was just kidding. But he wasn't. Of course he wasn't.  Well, that doesn't make any sense. I break the whole thing down, Sam. I'm going to enjoy this.  All right. So we just got back from break, but we went long last break. 
[00:01:00]  Right. And so we're kind of aware of that. The audience might not be, but we are sitting in this room.  Even the audience, though, which kind of helps the bit a little bit.  It helps it. Right.  And so Chip comes, and out of nowhere, we just started talking. And out of nowhere, he wants to send the show to break.  Now, we haven't done Chip sends the show to break in quite some time, which means it's not stale.  It's kind of...  And Chip always sends us to break in the worst possible moment.  What even started the fucking... What even started it? 
[00:01:30]  Like, literally, what... I don't even remember why Chip did that.  Yes.  For what?  We were just about to get it. That's why it was the worst possible moment, because we were about to get into the Anthony Wiener thing.  And they called him on.  Oh, yeah, when he had a farm or something, that was right.  Take us out, you twig cock sucker.  No, don't do it now.  Thank you.  And if he had an ounce of...  He should have done it.  Of course he should have.  You know he should have done it, right, Travis?  But then he goes, but I'm not E-Rock. 
[00:02:00]  But the audience doesn't know that?  That's the point.  He goes...  I don't think Jim saw that E-Rock wasn't here.  What did he possibly make?  Why don't you mention other things that have nothing to do with ears?  Why?  We do a radio show.  They don't see any of this stuff.  Do you think...  They just know the bit, and that...  It would have made people chuckle.  Like, oh, there's the bit.  Do you think that Jim, as Chip...  Now, I'm breaking down every wall we have.  Okay.  That Jim, portraying the character of Chip, sending us to break, was contingent. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  On E-Rock being in there.  No.  This was absolutely a good point.  Oh, no.  It was just a button that gets pushed.  It's not a...  There's no voice.  Yeah, it was right.  Is E-Rock in there?  No.  No, he's right here.  Oh, he's back now.  E-Rock.  What is he doing?  Oh, E-Rock, wait till you hear what happened while you were gone.  Hope you had a nice piss, E-Rock.  Yes.  E-Rock.  What were you doing?  Styling your hair in there or something?  Ah, good one.  E-Rock, Sal ruined the, uh, the bit.  Good.  Okay, what did you expect? 
[00:03:00]  Styling.  Oh, man.  Where were you, though?  Not here.  I know you weren't here.  What were you doing?  I had to take care of something.  What did you have to take care of?  Doesn't matter.  Yes, it does.  Why?  What, was you taking a fucking shit or something?  Good one, Chip.  I'm glad you made us wait for that one.  You should have heard it, Eric.  Wait, Chip's still laughing.  Fuck, yeah.  Eric, Chip goes to take out the show.  I go to break, but we just got back.  It was inopportune, but it was funny. 
[00:03:30]  Okay.  And it was less than a minute of material, which would have, uh, it would have been great.  Yeah, I said something fucking hilarious.  I said, take us out, pig.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Continuing on with the worst of the week countdown, highlighting all the best of the Opie and  Anthony Show this week.  Uh, we're gonna hear from Anthony, of course, because he's part of the Opie and Anthony Show,  but specifically, and his war against the MTA workers of New York City, uh, uh, Josh Gad 
[00:04:00]  in studio, Ty West in studio, Anthony making self-improvements to his, uh, aesthetic, uh, and  of course, intern Jackie's goodbye.  But before all that, you've heard callers call up and say, bu-bu-bu-boys, m-boys.  There's a man who's, uh, been a character on the show for quite some time, an integral  part of Opie and Anthony history.  His name is, uh, Bruce Mittman.  And to those of you who have never heard that name before, you must not have been listening 
[00:04:30]  long.  Bruce Mittman has been a part of the show since their Boston days.  15 years.  Well, Opie decided to do what he does when he doesn't have a lot of show prep, and that's  look through his phone and call somebody from his past.  Did we get Bruce Mittman on the phone?  Yes.  And then, I don't think that's a spoiler.  Here's what it sounded like.  There you go with the big check with, uh, Bruce Mittman.  Maybe I can give it to the Shwoogies. 
[00:05:00]  I present to the Shwoogies this check for $100,000.  Yes.  He was one of the greatest characters in our careers.  Do you have anyone literate enough to endorse the back of this check, Shwoogies?  He's, he'd go back, he'd go backstage and smoke dope with the jocks.  Bruce ruled.  Yeah.  He fucking ruled.  He was a fun guy.  Did he ever get mad at you for exposing his off-air antics? 
[00:05:30]  No, he loved when we talked about him.  He loved it.  Even when you brought up the Shwoogies and stuff?  Uh, I don't know.  He didn't really care.  He called me a few Christmases ago.  That's the last I heard from him.  I hope he's doing well.  Me too.  We should get him on the phone.  He really is a quintessential character in this universe.  Let me see something.  Hold on a minute.  People still call you...  I guarantee still listen to us.  B-b-b-boys.  I know.  Can they do that?  You do, right?  They don't do it right.  No. 
[00:06:00]  Because nobody remembers the context of it.  No.  All these guys listening...  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Ah!  Hold on a minute.  My slice.  My hook needs a little work.  Could you please watch my children while I go out and play some golf?  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  We'd have to babysit his kids.  He would literally drop his young children...  Impressible.  What were they?  Fucking like 13...  Yeah, I think his daughter was 13.  His son was younger, right? 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  Yeah, like fucking 12 or 11 or something.  And just dump them on the chairs in our studio.  And we'd have to fucking do a show.  A filthy show.  Right.  And, um...  And he would just fucking sit them there.  Boys, why are you calling me?  Uh, look.  I never liked you.  I don't want to talk to you.  You know how many checks...  Giant checks I had to print up?  For you boys.  You told everyone I called them shoogies. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Do you know how fucking...  The cost of giant checks...  He was the only GM that needed a giant checkbook.  My checkbook got enormous.  That was just his regular checkbook.  That's what it looked like, because he was tiny.  I'm tired of jumping out of bushes for photo ops.  Yes.  I don't need this.  I finally am able to show my face in public.  We'll see how much he's willing to admit. 
[00:07:30]  I never said Fagalos.  I never said Shwoogies or Fagalos.  And I certainly didn't call them retards.  I didn't say retards.  All right, pick up line nine.  All right, hold on a minute.  Bruce.  Yes.  Bruce.  How are you?  Bruce Mittman, you're on the air, by the way.  You're on the air, Bruce Mittman.  We were reminiscing a little bit.  We were reminiscing about the good old days,  and your name came up.  And we said, what the hell?  Let's call them up and just say hi, see what you're up to. 
[00:08:00]  And just like the old days, we're not prepared for the radio show,  so the reason we're reminiscing is because we ran out of material today.  Well, that's obvious, because I've been listening occasionally,  and I recognize that you've never prepared for your radio show.  Why screw with a good thing, Bruce?  Right.  Bruce always wanted us to prepare for our radio show.  Yeah.  By the way, I've noticed, you know, the other day I was thinking about it,  you know, because of you guys,  I could never run for any public office. 
[00:08:30]  And you would have loved to do that.  Oh, God, he was built for it.  He loves being out at these events and hobnobbing.  Sure.  Yeah.  And then I figured, thank God, that the FCC,  since we own 16 radio stations,  has never checked any of your videos or audio,  because then they would probably condemn me from owning radio.  We also said how we loved you, Bruce.  Yes.  Well, we, I met you on hand. 
[00:09:00]  I saw you on hand.  Could you get me on hand at the show, please?  Oh, you got things to say.  I need to express myself politically.  I don't doubt it, but I don't want to hear any liberal drivel from you.  Liberal?  No, no, no.  Bruce was.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Believe me.  I'm on the opposite spectrum of that topic.  I will speak to my good friend, Sean Hannity,  and try to get you on the program. 
[00:09:30]  You should do red-eye, too.  You look old, Anthony.  We are old.  I got to tell you, Bruce, we've been doing this for a while.  You do realize we're, I think we're pushing 20 years now.  Do you remember, also, I was no kid when I got hired.  Right.  We made believe we were.  By the way, our air conditioning here at the advertising agency.  Say, say, call the guy.  Call the guy.  We were reminiscing about the big check for the shwoogies.  For the shwoogies. 
[00:10:00]  I said before the phone call, I don't know how much he's willing to admit.  Come on, now.  You might have seen it differently, because many years have gone by.  You know, they're going to misinterpret my comedy as serious stuff now.  That's true.  That's right.  You're going to be in trouble.  All right.  How many things did you have to do to get us out of trouble back in the day?  That's what we were trying.  We remembered we would have to meet with the special interest groups. 
[00:10:30]  We had to sit with the gay group for one time.  The gay group, and we said how cool you were.  That was the sensitivity training.  Right, right.  Sensitivity training.  Then we had where you jumped out of the bushes and shook Mayor Menino's hand.  I had a photographer on hand for that.  Of which you didn't talk to me for three years after.  Well, you were in the competition then.  Wow.  Do you realize what I had to do just to be able to drive in Boston without getting my car towed? 
[00:11:00]  See?  See?  It really was.  We put him in a tough spot.  Yeah.  You were a soldier.  And then we bought the pies for the big publicity stunt to try to save our jobs.  Oh, that's right.  And then, but people don't know that, for example, Wow, I had to kill Wow by having the state police fake a letter to me about a threat from the governor that didn't really exist.  Oh!  None of it was real. 
[00:11:30]  Just to get you the scrub.  Wow, Bruce!  Wow, he's admitting something today.  That's a good one.  But we never knew that.  But Wow really took off when we came to New York.  Yeah.  They were willing to accept it down here.  Unlike Bruce Mittman, who shut it down.  Yeah, I know, I know.  I was a bad guy.  I mean, you know, thank God you went to New York and then the church shut you down.  Yeah.  You had to think we were never going to learn.  Maybe we could get you, Bruce would have been great in that situation. 
[00:12:00]  Maybe we could get you out of trouble.  We'll ask if maybe the Pope wants to throw rosary beads over your heads from a distance like a ring toss.  By the way, Glenn Lucas just walked by.  You know, Glenn Lucas.  Oh, yes, Glenn.  Wow.  Yes, and he says hi.  He just waved.  Tell him.  He's like, oh, God.  I remember Glenn.  Remember the big event?  The mayor was going to throw pies at us to save our jobs?  Oh, yes.  That worked out really well for about eight minutes. 
[00:12:30]  He didn't go for that one.  And that was not your idea, Bruce.  I know that.  Well, you know what?  I have to admit it was my stupid idea.  But here's the best part about this whole thing.  I don't think your listeners have any clue.  I get suspended and lose one month of salary.  Yeah.  And you guys go off and sign a multi-million.  You should have paid us more.  My family still curses your name. 
[00:13:00]  My family still curses.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, Bruce is suspended.  We leave him in Boston.  Where he has to now live among these people, and we're gone.  We're in the big city lights of Broadway signing huge fucking deals.  We see the skyline of Boston in our rearview mirror, and he has to deal with everybody.  And I'm not allowed to walk in my office for a month without police escort.  The fucking destruction in our wake was terrible back then. 
[00:13:30]  What a fun, innocent time that was.  It sure was, innocent.  Oh, different animal back then, the radio business.  Wow, I like hearing his perspective on these things.  I thought everything was all right.  Hunky-dory.  Yeah.  Not quite.  I wish you guys could do some of our radio stations, but, you know, since you're on Sirius now, you've become invisible, of course.  Oh, there it is.  But the checks have it.  Can I borrow some money? 
[00:14:00]  I think we owe you a month's salary.  God, we would go on your stations in a second.  I know.  That would be a blast.  What do you got these days?  Well, we own five markets in Watertown, New York, home of the 10th Mountain Division.  Oh.  Three in Ogdensburg, New York.  Five in Elmira Corning.  And two in Oleand, New York.  All in upstate New York.  Upstate New York stations, huh?  Hmm.  Wow.  You know what?  We'll have you on sometime. 
[00:14:30]  That would be fun.  That would be.  Go up there.  Do we need to pay you or anything?  I mean, you know.  Well, we'll do a little charity.  Yeah.  Maybe for the shwoogies.  We'll donate our pay.  You do remember the giant check, right?  That you were so annoyed because you wanted to play golf that day?  There's a picture of it on eBay for sale.  Wow.  Come on.  Is there really?  The check is for sale?  Yeah.  I saw it.  The other day, my son sent me a photo.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:00]  That's funny.  Of that photo on eBay.  Wow.  Damn.  Do you miss the old days, Bruce?  When AF was really happening?  I do because it was fun.  It was a great time.  It really was.  The music was very cool and everybody working there was great.  Ozone and stuff.  I mean, we were doing things that nobody else was doing in the country.  That probably was one of the best rock stations ever.  I try to tell people and they just don't care.  Yeah, no, they don't care.  No, I'm serious.  I go, you don't understand. 
[00:15:30]  We were breaking bands and doing radio no one else was doing.  I know, but no, you know, the problem is that radio just never got that notoriety that other media does.  And so you tell people and they go, oh, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  Can you pass the mustard?  Yeah, that's true.  And now no one takes any chances out there.  Well, you can't.  I mean, you know, it's so PC out there.  It's just ridiculous.  Right.  Damn ridiculous how PC I am. 
[00:16:00]  You got the satellite, Bruce.  Yes, I do.  I listen to you guys occasionally in the morning.  I must admit.  Oh, nice.  All right.  I like hearing that.  No, we never know when.  Let me see.  Somebody called me to tell me that you were talking about me getting into my Tahoe in a ladder.  Well, we said you had a rope ladder.  The big suburban.  Right.  To get in and out of it.  That was a big suburban there, Bruce.  We think you were 5'5".  So when I come to New York and I come in to morning drive, I'm going to be there Monday. 
[00:16:30]  Can I come in?  I swear we're on vacation next week.  You know, he was my big chance.  I know, right?  Bruce, are you buying the Boston Globe?  Well, no comment.  No, I didn't buy it.  John Henry did, though.  I thought you were involved with that.  Well, I was with Ernie Bach, Jr.  Right.  And we were going to make a run at it, but, you know, no comment.  No comment. 
[00:17:00]  No comment.  No comment.  Wheel in a deal.  Bruce is always wheel in a deal.  Bruce is great, man.  Buying newspapers, because that makes sense these days.  What?  I said I got to try to make up for all the income I lost because of you guys.  Oh, income you lost.  I think you got a few shots in.  You took advantage of us a little bit.  You got a few good years out of us for the...  And a very cheap salary. 
[00:17:30]  The pittance that you slid across the paper at the Chinese place that day.  The Chinese buffet.  See, he's laughing.  He knows.  And we laughed at you that day.  Oh, I remember that.  And that's the day my wheels started turning, by the way.  Get us out of here.  Every time I pass that Chinese restaurant, I have to laugh.  How are the kids that we used to babysit?  How old are they now?  Oh, well, you know, Andrew's a producer out in Hollywood. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Is he doing well?  Yeah, he's doing great.  He's in the middle of three...  He works for a company called Berman Braun.  He runs all of their feature film group.  Wow.  How old is he now?  He's 30 already.  Oh, my God.  I'm not kidding.  He was a kid.  Bruce would drop his actual kids off and say, can you watch him for an hour or two?  I got to go do whatever he had to do.  There was no better babysitting service than the two of you.  How twisted are you? 
[00:18:30]  How twisted are you?  Because when the mics were off, we really talked some shit.  And there's your young kids in the room.  Your babysitters were shock jocks.  Right.  Do you know that...  That's right.  Do you know that...  Do your listeners understand how many times I walked into your studio and there were women  completely nude around speaking to me in their vagina saying, hello?  Those were the days, right?  I noticed you had a lot of excuses why you needed to be in the studio, too. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, remember that?  They used to come down the hall like, bro, hey, we haven't seen you in a while.  Oh, what's up?  I'm checking on the traffic, making sure that...  I got to check the traffic log.  Yes.  I'm staring at a picture with Green Day in my office, and nobody knows how stoned they  were when they took that picture.  Oh, wait.  Remember that day they came in?  Well, that was the day they destroyed our studio.  Yeah.  And actually, Bruce was cool with it.  He's like, yeah, man, that was a cool moment.  Yeah.  I remember.  That was a cool moment. 
[00:19:30]  Come on.  They threw the tombstone through the wall.  Well, all I know is that they're smoking pot in a studio that has a halogen system, which  would suck all the air.  And then one of them picked up a tombstone, and it was a real tombstone.  I don't even know the story behind that.  That might be before us.  And they threw it through the sheetrock.  Yeah, through the wall.  Yeah.  They were out of their minds.  That was fun, though.  What happened with Rocco, man?  He just had, his health was bad.  I think he died. 
[00:20:00]  He had diabetes.  Right.  And I think he, yeah, poor Rocco.  We loved him.  Dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sad.  Hillman, Hillman's doing really well up in Boston.  Oh, shit.  You fucking, oh, no.  There's the reunion.  Reunion over.  Reunion over.  You can't just let it go nicely.  Because it's reunion over.

The Worst of the Week Countdown is rolling on with me, Sam Roberts, from O&A and after Opie and Anthony Live.  You can get me on Twitter, at NotSam, and all my YouTube videos and everything else is at NotSam.com.  Still a lot to go through this week on The Countdown.  Josh Gad was in studio.  Ty West was in studio.  Intern Jackie said goodbye. 
[00:25:30]  Anthony continued his war against the tollbooth workers of New York City.  But what I want to play first is Opie and Anthony being out of touch with rap music.  Opie and Anthony, when they decide that something is no longer worth looking into, they decide it sucks.  You know what I mean?  When rap music kind of passes them by a little bit, they decide instead of either learning about it or admitting that they just don't know, they'll just try to find flaw in it. 
[00:26:00]  And I don't like that.  I tried to stand up for hip-hop.  Somebody's got to on this goddamn show.  Here's what it sounded like.  Number six.  Jay-Z ruining fucking beautiful voices.  It's his song.  See, that should be banned.  Jay-Z?  Rap guys ruining beautiful voices should be banned.  Yeah, beautiful songs.  Let the beautiful voice fucking sing. 
[00:26:30]  New York!  Hey, that's what I'm talking about.  You don't need to comment about what she's singing.  Mix the Nets!  Right.  Sometimes people like a little rap mixed in with R&B.  It's hip-hop.  Well, can we at least come to an understanding, at least let her finish her beautiful voice part before he starts in with his dumb shit again?  People like hearing Jay-Z's voice.  Oh, yeah.  My man's still there.  Don't worry.  He's there. 
[00:27:00]  He's the hype man.  He's the MC.  You're Jay-Z.  Relax.  It's going to be okay.  Let the chick sing her part without you fucking jumping in.  Holland Tunnel.  Ha, ha.  Right.  That's Alicia Keys.  A voice like an angel.  What are you going to say?  If you can filter out the Jay-Z shit, you can hear that she has a beautiful voice.  It was his song.  Play the part again, but why didn't...  Shut up until she's done.  That's all I'm asking.  She's hyping it up a little bit.  He doesn't need to.  He found a chick with an amazing voice.  Let her sing.  She did it without him.  He's commenting.  He's doing play-by-play as she's singing. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  Who says that?  When did that become acceptable?  There's play-by-play going on.  Just talk over her fucking song.  That's what you do in hip-hop.  Nah.  Hip-hop.  They're insecure.  Rapping over records.  Hip-hop guys are insecure.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  Just about keeping the party going.  Oh.  Why do they sing about the club?  Why is the club an amazing place?  It's amazing.  The club stinks.  What's so amazing about the club?  Because that's where they get down.  That's where you get the bub.  They pop bottles. 
[00:28:00]  You're popping bottles, yo.  And then if you dance real well, then you're a, what?  You're a superstar.  But where are you a superstar?  Just in the club?  At the club.  But then what does that mean?  You can roll on Molly.  You can pop bottles.  You can do whatever you want.  You can rock some Tom Ford.  It literally is such childish shit.  It's all the same.  You can pop some.  And then you've got to go on the dance floor and show your shit off.  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  Would I get you a promotion at work? 
[00:28:30]  Yo, I'm having a bottle that we know.  A bottle of something.  Right.  The girls all love you.  Right.  Got it.  Hey, I'm popular with the girls.  And everyone wants to be you.  And the bucks are flying.  Shut up.  Same fucking shit.  Bring your club skills to your boss and say, hey, well, you know, you passed me up for that promotion, bud.  You know what I could do in the club?  Watch it.  At the club, I'm fucking great.  Right.  It's a celebration of life. 
[00:29:00]  They started from nothing.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, he's money.  Big handfuls.  No one in rap has a fucking credit card.  Putting it on the charge card.  Paying it on time.  Yeah, oh.  Why don't you stop with the big handfuls of bills?  It's exciting.  You start from nothing.  And then you look around.  Started from the bottom.  And now we're here.  Look at us.  I understand that, but every song, and I know rock songs have varied themes, but there  are a lot more themes than the same shit.  We got it.  All we do is sing about the club. 
[00:29:30]  What about the hands up one?  I tweeted about it and only a few people got it because I guess they don't listen to pop  music.  Which song?  The hands up like the, like the ceiling can't hold us.  Who gives a fuck?  That's the only time.  That's the only time.  Can you play that song?  Yeah.  This is the one that's going to drive Jimmy nuts if you haven't heard the song before.  They want you to put your hands up like the ceiling can't hold us.  Who cares?  What happens then?  You're living in the moment.  Listen to this one, Jimmy. 
[00:30:00]  This has a lot of the shit you're saying today.  And everyone in the club puts their hands up.  What are you fighting for?  We're invincible in this moment.  I do like this, though.  See?  It's catchy, but the words are stupid.  They could be singing about something else.  Why would they?  Children are hungry.  They're not eating.  It's light on their face.  I would enjoy that, too. 
[00:30:30]  And then this shit.  So pretty much, Oak just wants instrumentals until the hook.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like good hooks, and I like beautiful voices.  There are adult contemporary radio stations.  I just want to know why it's cool to fucking put your hands up like the ceiling can't hold us.  Because we're living in the moment.  And then what happens to those people when the club closes? 
[00:31:00]  Because then they're on the street like every other dummy.  How about you sing a song, the club is all closing, we're going for eggs.  Right after the club.  Yeah, where's the song about right after they leave the club?  Going to the diner.  Yeah.  Going to the diner.  Same thing.  I always talk more about rap songs than clubs.  Because club songs are just mindless shit.  And this guy's still babbling.  He could have done the hook there again.  Yeah.  He's doing another hook at the end of the verse.  All right, let's go.  Stop singing about the beat.  When's the last rock song that harped up the guitar? 
[00:31:30]  Listen to the drums.  Never.  There have been lots of rock songs that scream out guitar before the guitar started.  It's one second of it.  It's not the entire.  And they don't yell guitar.  They yell guitar.  And it's.  It's.  It's the same thing.  It's not the same thing.  It doesn't permeate the entire song.  And there's lots of rock songs about partying and drinking.  And love it.  Yeah, there are.  But I'm saying the point of view in rap songs is almost all the same. 
[00:32:00]  It is an alpha point of view.  And it is the same fucking point.  Fuck.  Like, the ceiling can't hold us.  Right.  But they're fighting.  There's a fight going on.  And there's a thing.  And the ceiling can't hold these people.  Because they're superstars.  See?  There's a lot going on.  There's nothing going on.  That's my point.  What's a good fucking hardcore rap song about the club?  Oh, God.  I mean, 50 cents in a club is probably the quintessential.  That's the name of the, you know. 
[00:32:30]  Club song.  Every one of those fucking songs is the same thing.  But they're not.  You don't even listen to rap.  Yo, I listen.  I listen to a lot more rap than you think.  Big Daddy Kane, asshole.  Exactly.  You don't even know who that more was.  No, I don't listen to new rap.  But I mean, historically, I've listened to rap.  Because they used to rap about all sorts of shit.  Not just the club.  Do you like Cool Herc?  Exactly.  They used to say, a hip hop, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie.  Exactly.  It was all fun.  You don't stop rocking.  That would be like me citing Motley Crue and Poison. 
[00:33:00]  Exactly.  That's fair, though.  Well, you should.  There's still bands that are still working.  That's right.  And Motley Crue.  Those guys are true artists.  What are you talking about?  Motley Crue and Poison didn't have the same.  You ever hear Girls, Girls, Girls?  Yes, exactly.  That's art.  No, but they didn't always sing about the same thing.  Well, neither do these rap guys.  Just because you don't like girls, you don't appreciate a song about girls.  Exactly.  You just said the problem was rap guys sing about girls.  They got their money.  Rap guys come from the same.  What are some of the themes, Jimmy? 
[00:33:30]  It's the same alpha male point of view.  It's the same tone to all the guys.  Like, they're all the same.  At least in rock music, you have fucking different tones.  You have the fucking, the simp who's always in love, or you have, but you know what I  mean?  You have different, you know, Sabbath sings about certain things and Kiss.  There's just a bit of a difference, whereas in rap, they're all coming from the same point  of view.  Yeah, but that's because that's your music, so you listen to full albums and you listen  to all the songs, whereas rap, you just get a taste of what's on the radio, so you're 
[00:34:00]  like, everything's the same.  Every other song is about the club.  But you know that's true.  It's true about rock, too.  Watch rap videos.  They're all fucking...  Watch rock videos.  Every rap video has a guy in it.  They always are flashing money.  Rock guys aren't always flashing money.  Look how much we made!  All right, good.  Yep.  They're not always doing that.  Yeah, but the whole rock culture was that.  It was cars, and it was girls, and it was drinking, and it was...  Yeah, but there's more of a variety in their topics and what they sing about.  Rap, it's the same as fucking black guys who will not air certain dirty laundry in public. 
[00:34:30]  Like, black guys talk differently among themselves.  That's why there's just a...  It's a cultural thing where that scene is successful only.  And, like, Eminem's the only guy that raps about being afraid.  That's why I like him.  He's the only guy in that whole fucking business who raps about being scared.  None of them are scared.  He a pussy.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, none of them are fearful, or none of them... 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, but that's also because...  Gotta look all whore.  Yeah.  I'm a whore.  That's what I mean.  But if you listen to as much rap as you've listened to rock, then you would have a different  perspective on it.  Name me rap songs who...  Name me another rapper who talks about being afraid.  And maybe there is another one, but name me another one that talks about being afraid.  I don't know.  I'm scared.  I mean, you listen to a lot.  Yeah, sure.  So name me another rapper or a rap song that kind of talks about fear, or, like, he talked  about being fucking molested.  Like, I'm not saying every rapper should do that, but he's, like, the only one doing 
[00:35:30]  it.  Then it put his dick in my ass.  Well, he's not doing it anymore.  But you know what I'm saying.  Nobody's even listening to it anymore.  Historically, he's the only one who did it.  Yeah.  Who else...  Who else...  But in all of that time, who else has been...  That's what bugs me about it.  Gangsta fag.  Gangsta fag was great.  But they don't fucking...  But people...  Their audience doesn't want to hear it either.  I mean, if they did, they wouldn't be selling records.  Oh, that's true.  Maybe that's true.  What about Blur...  What about the Song of the Summer, Blurred Lines?  Although Eminem's the biggest-selling rapper in fucking history. 
[00:36:00]  He's white.  That's huge.  But also because he's good.  There's, you know, fucking...  No, he's good.  Yeah, I mean...  DJ Snow is a white rapper.  He's not going to sell...  Vanilla Ice is a white rapper.  He doesn't sell, like...  No, no.  Of course, of course.  I'm not saying Eminem's not.  And lyrically, he's great.  And he's got Dr. Dre.  I mean, he's a legit guy in that business.  But he's more interesting to me because of what he talks about.  I meant more.  He can get away with more because he's white.  It's the same reason he's never said the N-word in one song.  Not saying nigga's one thing, but he doesn't... 
[00:36:30]  What I don't like about Eminem is the only targets he goes after are weak ones.  Like, he doesn't even make fun of...  Yeah, that's kind of corny.  But I mean...  Come on, dude.  But he knows that, you know, he can get away with this.  He can do more emotional stuff.  And he can talk more about being scared.  But he can't talk about being tough.  No, but he does.  Sure he does.  As long as his targets are white, he does.  That's what I mean.  I don't like that.  But yeah, of course he does.  He's trashed in St. Clown Posse.  That's who he can trash.  He talks about being tough in a general sense. 
[00:37:00]  He just doesn't compare himself to black guys that say he's tough.  And he doesn't...  You know what I mean?  But those are his peers.  Like, he can't compare himself to his peers.  He's never done that.  Maybe not.  You know, as far as being ballsy goes.  He's like, okay, I'll do this instead of that.  But, I mean, his subject matter is just more varied.  And I don't think that other rappers couldn't do it if they're good.  I think other rappers...  I mean, there are a lot of good rappers.  Oh, boy.  But I think the thing that made Run DMC so fucking hot so fast was the fact they put guitar in their fucking rap.  Of course, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Like, just anything different.  The themes...  And I like rap.  I'm not just shit.  I like it.  But thematically, it's too fucking similar.  All of it.  Oh, boy.  You lose, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Well, I'm...  The tweet came in, so you lost.  Sam's wrong.  You guys are fucking nailing it.  Fuck the club.  There you go.  Oh, fuck the club.  It says that on Twitter?  That's it.  You're done.  I mean...  It's gotta be true.  You are done.  You gotta know when to admit defeat, I guess.  I don't think their audience wouldn't like it if it was good.  I really don't.  I don't think rap audiences can't handle that stuff. 
[00:38:00]  I think they would...  As long as the beats are good and fucking...  It's sung well.  I mean, I think...  You know?  Jay-Z's whole album is about cocaine deals.  He's...  Jay-Z has many topics that he sings about.  Oh.  A lot of songs are about the club.  Jay-Z's sung about the club.  Jay-Z's sung about slinging crack.  He's sung about missing a girl.  Annie.  Money.  He's sung about Lil Orphan Annie.  He's sung about having money.  He's rapped about smoke a weed.  Uh-huh. 
[00:38:30]  Uh-huh.  But he's made love songs.  And he got a New York City map and...  Made...  And sung about every fucking square inch of us.  Some geographically based songs.  Yeah.  It's a hard knock life.  It's a great song.  And that's the other thing.  He's been putting out hits from 96 until 2013.  It's a fad.  Okay.  Go back.  Because he's doing it again.  He's insecure.  Let the fucking little broad do her part.  You hear him go, uh-huh. 
[00:39:00]  It's a sped-up track from a movie soundtrack.  All right.  But tell him to shut the fuck up and let her do her thing.  No, people don't want to hear that, though.  Because he's doing play-by-play.  Let's let them do their thing.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Listen for him doing play-by-play.  Take the bass line out.  Uh-huh.  Here it goes.  Bam.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Let it bump.  Uh-huh.  It's the hard knock life.  He's feeling it. 
[00:39:30]  You can feel it, too.  He's letting you know.  Like, oh shit, this is hot.  Cole thinks it's hot.  I couldn't wait the last bit.  Just one second.  See, he's singing about going from swinging rock on the corner.  Page three of the lyrics.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He's singing about getting his life together.  Well, he's singing about, you know, getting that paper.  Right.  Right.  Let's have Roland read Jay-Z lyrics and watch his brain blow up.  Yeah, I'll get us some 10 o'clock.  What song?  Fuck.  What about Blurred Lines?  It's a great song.  Yeah, but you got T.I. rapping over it, messing it all up.  Some people are saying that that does...  Right?  I like that, but...  I think it's too much sometimes, man.  Give me Blurred Lines. 
[00:40:30]  This is the song of the summer.  Yeah, it is.  I know you want it.  It's Alan Thicke's son, Robert.  Where did he come from, by the way?  Alan's close.  He's been around for a while.  But who didn't even fucking knew Alan Thicke had a son?  A lot of people.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's been around a while now.  He's kind of getting old, actually.  Yeah, he's like in his mid to late 30s.  I never knew he even had a son.  He had a few hits before this.  He did.  Grandmaster Mel and the Furious Five. 
[00:41:00]  Huh?  You don't want to talk about that.  He's talking about different shit, though.  See, this is a cool song.  Great song.  And then T.I. comes in.  It wasn't needed.  I think they're trying to appeal to hip-hop radio and pop radio.  Hey, hey, hey.  They got it with the hey, hey, hey.  Double their spins.  I didn't think Pharrell was enough, I guess.  Where's T.I. coming soon, right?  Yeah.  The video's pretty good.  Shit. 
[00:41:30]  The one with the titties?  Did you see the Uncensored one?  Yes, we did.  Cool, pretty good.  That's a really cool song.  Great song.  And then T.I. comes in, and it just wasn't needed.  Yeah, I think sometimes they try to craft these songs for, you know what I mean?  Because you don't know when it's going to be a hit.  So they got to throw in a rap verse, just in case.  Where is the rap verse?  T.I. comes in, either this verse or the next one. 
[00:42:00]  There he is.  I'm looking at tits.  I don't mind this.  A lot of times I hate when rap comes into a song like this.  I don't mind this. 
[00:42:30]  It fits, I think.  But a lot of people are with me.  Damn, that chick's naked.  I don't know.  Wow.  The fucking tits are showing on TV.  Ripping off, what's his name there?  Robert Palmer?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Ripping off Tiny Tim.  Simply Irresistible with naked chicks.  Look at that fucking ass.  Jesus.  Of course, we gotta close the curtains.  Where the fuck do we work?  We can't play the Blurred Lines video. 
[00:43:00]  Here in church.  Look, they're closing the curtains.  They're closing the curtains for the Blurred Lines video.  The uncensored one where they're completely naked.  Oh my God.  You know who Robin Thicke's wife is?  Who?  Paula Patton, who's in here.  Oh, she's fucking hot, man.  I am?  He's been with her for a really long time.  Yeah.  20 years or something.  Wow.  It's a great song.  They're calling this the summer song, right?  It is the summer.  It is, right?  Oh.  He really looks like his dad. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he really does.  Jesus Christ.  Oh my God!  Did you see those kids?  It's ridiculous.  I fucking just, I couldn't even contain myself.  I had to yell.  Wow.  That girl is amazing.  There's a new, uh, when we're talking about rap and all that, there's a new song to add  your collection of songs that just use the N-word constantly.  Constantly?  Yeah.  What's that?  It's called Fuck With Me, You Know I Got It.  Can we hear some Fuck With Me, You Know We Got It? 
[00:44:00]  What?  Yeah, Jay-Z featuring Rick Ross.  Yeah?  I've been corrected, by the way.  As somebody who reminded me of a guy, I should have remembered.  Who?  He's saying Tupac.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is Bone Thugs a group, or Bone Thugs?  They did Bone Thugs.  It's an harmony group.  KRS-One.  I should have remembered KRS-One.  I'm not familiar with Most Deaf or Canine.  Or Cypress.  Like, I don't know a lot of the music, but KRS is one I really like, so I should have  thought of it.  Yeah.  That fucking Blurred Lines video.  That uncensored one is fucking... 
[00:44:30]  That's ridiculous.  Got me all worked up.  Jesus.  Is this it?  Yeah, wait till the first verse comes in.  You'll love it.  Rick Ross' first verse.  I do like these.  I like a good rap song that drops them bombs constantly.  Okay, then you'll like this.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  But the N-word's bad, right?  Remember, kids.  Remember, yeah.  Remember, kids.  It's fine.  If you say it, you're done.  Right. 
[00:45:00]  But this is acceptable.  This is fine.  By the way, this is Rick Ross, who 50 Cent was not able to even come close to killing  his career.  Yeah.  50 Cent?  Yeah.  No.  You couldn't touch him.  No, it's really weird.  That did nothing to it.  Because it's too good.  When does this goddamn song start?  A little while.  How many N-words in this song?  A lot.  A lot.  Over, under 100.  What do you take?  It's under 100, but Rick Ross' first verse is just rhyming the N-word with the N-word.  Oh.  Oh.  These songs are good for getting your ego on. 
[00:45:30]  These sounds dangerous.  Is he really considered good?  I guess he is.  Rick Ross?  Yeah, he's hot.  The curtains are still closed because we're here in the N-word.  That's right.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure.  I don't want to see four smiling faces.  All right.  One.  Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, nigga. 
[00:46:00]  Nigga.  Money talk, I speak fluent, nigga.  Reebok's on, I just do it, nigga.  The way he says it is great.  Look at me, I'm pure, nigga.  I bet the holes in my door, nigga.  I love this.  I'm Bob, I do the money dance.  You like Rick Ross?  Yeah.  My bitch whip, cause 100 grand.  Red bird, you see me slide.  Mm, mm, mm, do it.  Say it's a bitch, I hope she's about it.  Boop. 
[00:46:30]  You're down.  I like it.  You're liking it.  Boop.  Fuck with me, you know I got it.  Boop.  Fuck with me, you know I got it.  See, Jay-Z's still putting out hits.  Yeah.  Still.  Fuck with me, you know I got it.  Nobody else does that.  Nobody.  No, no.  For 96 to 2013.  Yeah.  Even though this is kind of enjoyable.  It's great.  It's just drivel.  It is drivel.  Fuck with me, I got it.  You know I got it.  It's just utter nonsense. 
[00:47:00]  Fuck with me, you know I got it.  You need that sentiment in your life sometimes, though.  Sometimes, yeah.  Coach landed in Rome, nigga.  Oh, he's about it, too.  Oh, hell sees his home, niggas.  Oh, hell sees his home, niggas.  That's Jay-Z?  That's Jay.  He hangs out with the president.  Why is he messing up everyone's songs?  It's his song.  No, let the other guy do it.  He was doing great.  Yeah, he hangs out with the president.  Yeah, but no, no.  But it's a...  I just... 
[00:47:30]  This is why when people say...  Pause this.  ...outrage over the word nigger, this is why it's phony.  I don't care why black guys say it or it's empowerment or it's ironic.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's the outrage is fucking fake.  It's phony.  Jay-Z can jump on the track and say a nigga got unlimited credit.  You think Obama has the conversation with him?  Like, look, maybe you should set a better example there, Mr. Z?  No, because he doesn't care.  He likes the music.  Of course not.  Of course.  I was thinking the other night, the word...  If white people use the word nigger, it's like... 
[00:48:00]  It's the new abracadabra.  It's a magic word that makes your career, life, and everything disappear in one fucking word.  I just think how horrible that is.

The Worst of the Week Countdown on this, the Opie and Anthony channel with me, Sam Roberts from ONA and after Opie and Anthony Live.  This week, we will still play Intern Jackie's Farewell to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony in his war against tollbooth workers.  Josh Gad in studio.  Sal, well, we already played Sal, ruining a bit. 
[00:53:30]  I'm sure he'll ruin something coming up.  Ty West in studio.  As a matter of fact, why don't we play Ty West right now?  Ty West is a guy who's a fan of the show.  He's been a friend of the show for a long time.  He's a horror movie director.  He's an actor.  And now he's in, like, two movies coming out on the same day.  Plus, he's working on a movie.  He's finding work in Hollywood.  Not a lot of us can say that.  Ty West on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number five.  Got Ty West outside the studio. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Let's bring Ty in.  I was reading all kinds of things.  He's in a movie.  He's in a movie.  In a movie.  Yeah.  But you're not making a movie.  You're in a movie now, Ty.  That's pretty cool.  I'm in both.  I'm trying to expand my horizons here.  Yeah?  Nice.  As actor.  Yeah, I'm in two movies, actually, that come out the same day.  So I figure if you're going to do it, it's like, you know, go big or go home.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm in a movie called You're Next that comes out August 23rd that you're probably seeing.  I see all. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It looks very scary.  And then I'm in a movie called Drinking Buddies with Olivia Wilde and Anna Kendrick and Jake  Johnson from New Girl.  And that also comes out the 23rd.  And that's on VOD right now.  So that one you can watch.  Video on demand.  Yes.  And that's like a rom-com.  Oh, shit.  You're in a rom-com.  From craft beer and relationships.  Oh, man.  How do you fit into that?  I play the dickhead that works at the brewery.  Oh, okay.  A little comic relief?  Yeah, a little bit. 
[00:55:00]  And more just sort of like, I'm kind of the bad guy in the movie.  And I'm the one that kind of no one really likes.  Oh, but a little more calm than rom for you?  It is a bit more calm.  More calm?  Well, actually, I don't want to give too much away, but I do have some rom in this movie.  A little rom, too.  And it gets me in a lot of trouble.  Do you get to do any kissing scenes?  I don't want to give too much away, but I do have...  Do you have any scenes as hot as, like, Kevin Bacon got in The Woodsman?  Yeah, I'm like the kid in The Woodsman.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  I'm a woodsman.  But, yes, no, I do.  I get a little action in the movie.  So one of my best friends, who's actually in Your Next also and is in my new movie, he directed that movie.  So it's a very incestuous group of us.  Yeah, there is a lot going on.  If we just work with each other, then we'll just keep having jobs.  And you keep working.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  So he's one of my best friends, and he cast me as the asshole.  What's going on with this relationship?  I'm just auditioning.  Let me tell you that.  That's pretty good.  That is pretty good.  Yeah.  Very believable.  What, are you leaving me for another guy? 
[00:56:00]  Now, very scary.  I've seen the trailer.  Yes.  What is this?  Home Invasion.  It is.  So Your Next is a movie that a friend of mine, Adam Wingard, made.  And we made it two and a half years ago.  So it's kind of weird that it's coming out now.  But it's a great movie, and it's pretty crazy.  So it's a Home Invasion movie that's, you know, kind of, as we all know, a group of family gets together at this house for, like, a reunion.  And then the bad guys show up.  They should have guns! 
[00:56:30]  Fuck, yeah.  The twist in the movie, that's, like, what people like about it.  Yeah.  Is that the girlfriend that the son has brought home to meet his family has this background that she's this sort of, like, ex-survivalist.  So that's sort of the twist, is that the bad guys show up, but, you know, the people in the house are a problem too.  They didn't bank on this happening.  So, yeah, it's almost like this, it's kind of like this crazy horror Home Alone sort of movie.  Right, right.  Where people in the house fight back.  But it's pretty wild.  It's very scary with the masks on and stuff. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, scary.  Creepy.  I don't get scared that easily.  And the movie you did, that scene of her being chased through that basement towards the end was a creepy fucking scene.  Like, I thought of that recently for some reason, watching The Conjuring, which was pretty frightening in moments.  Yeah, it has some great, great set piece scary moments.  They showed too much in the trailer, which really wrecked it.  But that scene where she's being chased under, really was fucking creepy.  The old guy coming after her.  Yeah, yeah, innkeepers, yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I'm sorry, that was the innkeepers.  Yeah, that was fucking creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah, the old guy, like, they just show up in the light a little bit.  Yeah.  That's the shit that is scary.  Like, blood and guts and stuff doesn't really fuck me up.  I watch it, it's like, eh.  But that, when someone moves in a way that isn't, they're not supposed to move, like their arm turns backwards or they're on the ceiling, that shit still fucks me up.  Yeah, I think it's the stuff, I mean, it's the stuff that you think might, like, the violent stuff is like, well, at least I'll see it coming or I won't and it won't matter. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  But the, like, creepy ghost stuff, and I think that's why people think The Conjuring is so scary, is like, what if I come home and I open my closet and that is in the closet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even though it doesn't make sense, it's just that, like, weighs on you, and I think that's kind of scary.  Why don't you so used to hearing this from all of my years in stand-up?  Oh, oof.  But I mean, that brief.  Yes, that's it, that's all you get.  Yeah, next.  Yeah, I saw The Conjuring also, and it's kind of, it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be. 
[00:58:30]  It might have been a little overhyped.  Yes, I think so.  I think everybody kind of came out of it saying it's going to be the scariest movie you've ever seen, which is a little unfair.  I think it is scary, but you went in thinking, like, I'm going to have a heart attack.  Yeah, yeah, very fucking scary, and then it was kind of like, all right, I can get it.  Yeah, it's made $100 million, which is pretty wild.  I get, like, scary at the jumpy things, things that jump out like that, and in The Conjuring there was that scene with the little music box and the mirror.  It's like, oh, there's nothing behind me, and it just shuts the thing right in front of, that right in front of your face shit. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, that would get me every goddamn time.  The one that got everyone in the theater when I saw was when she's in the room, and they're, like, looking at the closet, and then all of a sudden, it's on top of the closet.  Yes!  And it, like, zoomed in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a doozy for everyone.  That was very fucking frightening.  Yeah.  Thank God they showed it in the trailer, so I knew it was coming.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It's such a weird thing with trailers, because I know they want to convey what's in the movie and kind of get the storyline a little, just so you're interested, but you can fuck it up so easily by giving too much away. 
[00:59:30]  It's hard, because it's like you've got to sell the movie as strong as you can to get people to come see it, and if that works, you ultimately, the downside is that people know too much about the movie.  Yeah.  But if you don't do that, they might not come.  That's true.  Marketing a movie is really, it's tricky, and it's, very few people are really good at it.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's that movie out now with fucking Marky Mark and Denzel and stuff.  Double Guns.  I think it is Double Guns, right? 
[01:00:00]  Fuck yeah.  Jesus, Chip had named the movie.  Pretty good.  Double Guns.  You should have been doing the marketing.  Yeah.  It's just Double Guns.  It's called Two Guns.  Yeah, it is Two Guns.  I like Double Guns better.  That would have been better, Chip.  Yeah, no one says that after a fucking thing.  Two Guns.  It's like, it, uh, that movie, now I don't know if it's a reveal or what have you, but  watching the trailer, you find out that these two guys think that they're in, like, they're 
[01:00:30]  bad guys, and one turns out to be like an army intelligence guy, and the other guy turns  out to be like FBI or something, and it's a reveal, like, that should be a big moment  in a movie, like, holy fuck, they're both good guys.  I gotta believe that that's in the first ten minutes of the movie, that it's like, oh,  otherwise, but who knows?  I mean, it could be the bigger reveal.  I've seen trailers where it's like, wow, that's a huge plot twist, and you just showed  it, so now when I watch this, the whole beginning, I'm gonna know that that happens. 
[01:01:00]  But then there's other times, like, so the movie, I'm in the city now finishing a new  movie, and I finish next week, and then we premiere at Venice and then Toronto, and  it's, uh, I did it with Vice, and so it's like, uh, it's like Vice's show, it's like  Vice goes to this commune to do a story about it, and it ends up being like Jonestown,  and they get stuck in the middle of this big mass suicide, um, but that's the movie  where it's like, you can't keep the mass suicide secret, but then it's like, what  if they know the mass suicide, a lot of people are gonna die, but that's kind of what makes  the first half of the movie intense, because it's like, you know where it's going, but 
[01:01:30]  how is it gonna get there?  That's true, you could know how something's gonna end, and then they kind of go back and  show what happens.  They do that a lot in Breaking Bad, you have the flash forward, you know what's  gonna happen, but then you're like, alright, how does that happen?  So you could get away with that part of it, but I've just seen movie trailers destroy movies.  Yeah, no, it's true, it can be really tricky.  It's funny, because again, you're next, we made it so long ago, that to see the trailers  and they're popping up all over TV now, which is, and it's like all my idiot friends in 
[01:02:00]  the movie, so I'm just like, there's Joe, and there's AJ, and it's really funny to see  everybody on TV, and it's such an intense trailer, and it's very weird to be a part  of that, and see it so mass-marketed in a way, and it's with all your, like, every  one of that movie are people I hang out with all the time, and have for the last ten years.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's really great to be like, oh, this one happened to punch through on this really  weird mainstream level, and it's exciting to see that.  Yeah, that is kind of, and how does that happen?  Like, what was it about this that... 
[01:02:30]  Well, it was that Adam had been, we'd all been making movies together, and then he  got, like, a little bit more money, not a lot of money to make this movie, and he was  just like, well, I'll just make it with you guys, because I know at least what we'll get  out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  And so we were like, whatever, and we just kind of went to Missouri and made it, and  now here we are.  So it's one of those things that I don't, I don't want to say that people didn't think  it was going to be this, but it was just like, yep, I'm going to go spend a week in Missouri.  That's about as much as we sort of thought of it, and hang out, do some karaoke, and,  you know, it's a college town, have a good time, and that'll be that.  Yeah, you're a big karaoke guy. 
[01:03:00]  I am, I do, I do enjoy it.  Can you sing?  I can sing karaoke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As in, like, I'm not, I'm good at karaoke, but I'm not a great singer outside of that.  I was a decent singer in high school, I was in a band, and then I'm just like, why am  I doing this?  You were not.  I was, though.  You were in a band?  Yes.  You were a singer in a band?  I was.  That's embarrassing.  All right, what?  He's such a fucker.  No, he's telling the truth.  What was the band's name?  Guns and Sunflowers. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, and what?  And I was, if you were even.  Those guys, no, those guys left, and went out to L.A. and got another singer.  Oh!  And they changed the sunflowers part.  Oh!  Wow.  So you were the original singer of Guns and Roses.  Well, it was Guns and Sunflowers when I was in it.  Yeah.  It was just different.  Sure.  Yeah, Paradise Town was just a little song we did.  You know?  He's a fucking asshole.  No, it wasn't.  I don't think this is true. 
[01:04:00]  It is true.  All right.  Absolutely.  Welcome to the woods!  No, it's jungle.  They changed it.  They stole my shit.  Sir, you're the Pete Best of Guns and Roses.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Or the fucking Bon Scott, really.  I just bet that there's a one-off line.  No, no.  Not an eight-minute bomb.  I didn't mean this to be an interview.  No, we're delving.  We kind of want to explore Guns and Sunflowers.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  They're good.  Do you have a song like Welcome to the Jungle?  Yeah.  I was trying to bring Natasha in today.  Yes!  Oh, yeah, what happened with that?  Oh, she flaked on me.  No, they started shooting second season last week, and so she was on hold for today,  and she was like, it might, it might not, and then last night she couldn't do it.  But she 100% will come in.  Yeah, I think we're going to have her in.  She seems really good.  Natasha Lyonne?  Orange is the New Black.  Orange is the New Black, and American Pie, and Pee Wee's Playhouse. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  She's great.  I was like, we were talking last week, and she was psyched, and then at the last minute,  sadly, she couldn't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  I told her that I was like, no matter what publicists say, go in and do the show.  She'll fit in well.  She seems like a lot of fun.  She is.  She's great.  She's very quick.  She'll be, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I really used to like her a lot.  Like, I had like a little crush on her and stuff.  She's very charming.  I think when she comes in here, you'll be, she can, because I think a lot of actresses  are just sort of like, kind of boring sometimes, where they're very just sort of reserved  or afraid of doing this, and she's not like that. 
[01:05:30]  She's just like, what's going on here, guy?  Come on, I'm your mother.  I can talk about this.  What's happening?  She's very animated.  Yeah, I'd love to have her in.  She's fun to hang with.  I saw her.  I think she showed up at one of the, yeah, yeah.  When I went to go see, uh, what the hell movie was it?  Oh, Incubus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And she was, she was at that one.  I was like, oh, look.  Yeah.  I told my friend PJ, because I know you guys love The Wire so much.  He was Ziggy on The Wire.  Oh, yeah.  He's in a new show on AMC that's coming out.  James.  Ransom.  Yeah.  That guy's good.  They used my cock in that second season. 
[01:06:00]  Looked good.  Also in The Hangover.  Just a different angle.  He's great, that guy.  Dude, that Ziggy character, I watched that sometime, and I, he's so absolutely hateable  and irritating.  Like, that son of a bitch played that role so well, man.  He's great.  Yeah.  He's on a new show called Low Winter Sun that starts after Breaking Bad.  It's a new AMC show that's kind of wire-ish.  Okay.  And he's sort of like one of the leads on that show.  So, but he lives here, and he'd come in.  Oh, that'd be great. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, my man.  What are you doing?  He's trying to talk to cheese.  Oh.  Oh, that was so embarrassing.  The dumb jacket.  He told you not to spend the money, Zig.  Did he fucking get that dog shit $2,000 coat?  The fuck you doing?  That was fucking terrible.  Oh, was he good, man.  Oh, was he fucking good.  That was a great series, man.  Season two got shit on so much, because it was the first time they departed from what we,  because it was only season two.  Yeah.  And it was so underrated.  When you watch that again, and when he fucking pulls out that pistol and shoots that Greek, 
[01:07:00]  and then his only correction is, can you say begged?  He begged.  Oh, was that funny?  I think it's the best season, because it has this, it has this like over, there's like  a mystery to the whole season.  The rest don't have that.  The rest are just, you're kind of moving along with the characters and the overall narrative  of the show.  So, but season two has the mystery of like, who's in the crate?  How'd this get there?  And then all the other stuff.  And I think it's, what's great about it is the departure to show that like, there's,  that was the first time you went like, oh, the show is more about drugs than it is just  the sort of drug dealers.  It's about the bigger picture.  And I think that's what made the show really pretty amazing. 
[01:07:30]  One of my favorite wire scenes is in that season two.  Not all of them, but when, when Omar shoots Brother Muzon in the stomach, that's one of  my favorite scenes in the whole series.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  That was a great fucking scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was watching yesterday, like a one-off episode of Lost Muzon.  Oh, wow.  So I'm watching, and I'm just, as I'm watching it, I'm kind of going like, this show is a  little kind of goofy and silly now.  I think it's ruined.  You watch it now, yes. 
[01:08:00]  Why is it ruined?  You can't, I think everybody disliked the end so much, and that it, and it was such  a, what's going to happen show, that when it was finally done, the idea of going back  and watching Lost is like, fuck you.  It has zero re-watchability.  Wow.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Fucked up.  Maybe the first season, if you were showing it to someone who didn't know, but at the  same time, it's all just, you know it's leading up to like.  Even though I love that last season scene with the father, like the Christian, I thought  was great in that season, that, in that scene, but I, I agree. 
[01:08:30]  I didn't love the ending.  Well, you guys all made fun of me for not watching Lost.  Now, you win in the end.  Look who's the big winner now.  When it was on, it was, it was very cool to watch.  Not one episode.  I liked watching it.  Not a one.  And that's the truth.  But going back and just watching a random episode now, you're like, oh, you know, everyone's  pulling their guns out and pointing it into the jungle and, and like the characters is  so over the top.  Well, there's also like, there's not much to that show other than the plot.  No.  Like it's a very plot only kind of show. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  The Wire is about all sorts of social commentary and themes.  And thank God it never got nominated for any Emmys except for writing in season five.  Yeah, right.  I'm so happy it didn't.  House.  Now that's a drama.  Hollywood should literally fucking, if I could just, if I could put AIDS in a fucking, in  a crop duster and fly it over those Emmy voting cunts.  That would be nice.  Certainly would be.  The Wire is the street.  Have you, I know I mentioned this to you the other day, but have you guys seen or talked  about Active Killing yet?  I've talked about it.  They didn't want to hear it. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I watched the trailer for that.  You got to see that movie.  That is so fucked up.  Explain what it is.  Because it's amazing.  It's a documentary that's out now and it's, it's an amazing movie to see, but I really  think it's sort of almost like a duty to go see this movie because it's unlike anything  you'll ever see ever in your life.  It's a documentary that this guy made while he was living in Indonesia and he's trying to  make a documentary about forming unions and it's like a totally fucked up country and  it's illegal to form unions and everyone's afraid to do it because if they do, they're  afraid that this sort of genocide from the 60s will come back and they could all be murdered 
[01:10:00]  and it's just such a corrupt country.  But while he was making that movie, he got to learn about this genocide.  There were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of communists, which are just like Chinese  people, were killed, like women and children and everything in the 60s.  And it's not really a widely talked about sort of massacre, but it was happening.  There was death squads and it was a really horrific thing.  So he was like, wow, maybe I'll make a movie about that because people don't know about  that.  But he was having a really hard time getting anyone to talk about it because they were  so afraid.  The country's still so afraid that it could happen again. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  So everyone's like, yeah, I don't really want to go down that road.  And then the people said to him, you know, you'd have a better chance talking to the  killers.  So he tracks down these guys who are in their 60s.  They're like grandparents now.  And they were like the heads of the death squads.  Wow.  And the thing is, these guys really killed millions of people.  And they're totally psyched about it.  Yeah.  And they've never been punished and the country doesn't see it as a problem.  So they're happy to talk about it.  And they're happy not only to talk about it, but he convinced them that the best way to  explain what they did was to reenact it in a movie. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  So he gets the real murderers to dress up in costumes with special effects and show how  they rape and murder children and kill people.  And it's...  Are they auditioning for that?  No, Uncle Paul.  Ty.  No, Uncle Paul.  Help me out.  And Paul.  It's just...  It is like one of the...  And that's kind of the hook is that like, oh my God, they dress up in the costumes.  But what's amazing about the movie is to see these conversations with these people who  are so disconnected from humanity and that because it just happened and because they  were never punished for it, they don't know that killing all those people was wrong. 
[01:11:30]  Was wrong.  And they don't know that showing you how they killed people and showing you how they  did it with less blood, that that's fucked up.  And they openly discuss it.  And then there's the victims from...  They're like hanging out with the victims.  And the victims are like, yeah, you killed my father.  And I had to bury him along the side of the road in the middle of the night.  And you ruined my life.  Wasn't that crazy?  Wasn't that cool when you did that?  Because he's still so afraid that they might turn on him.  And it's...  You just could never make that movie because that shouldn't exist.  Right, right.  And so the fact that it's there, it's like you watch it with your jaw on the floor. 
[01:12:00]  It's not a particularly enjoyable movie to watch.  It's not...  There's not a lot...  There's no real graphic footage of any sort of real killings right now.  Right, right.  But just hearing them discuss it and hearing them reenact it and having them put little kids  in the reenactments and seeing it traumatize the little kids is just...  It's just...  It's totally unreal.  With zero remorse.  None.  And to see the way that the...  Like, they go on talk shows.  Like, instead of me coming in here to be like, I'm in your next...  They'd be in here like, yeah, we killed all those Chinese.  Wasn't it cool?  Jesus.  The country's fine with it.  And so I think the movie is, one, really incredible because it's fascinating. 
[01:12:30]  Two, it's really incredible because it's unlike anything you'll see ever again.  And three, like, I don't want to say, like, something should be done.  Like, they should be taken to the Hague.  But there's an element of, like, something should be done because of what you're seeing.  But it never will be.  I mean...  And I think if that movie doesn't win the Best Documentary Oscar, then it's just...  It's all worthless.  Because not only is it amazing, you'll just never get a movie like that ever again.  Yeah, yeah.  Because how could you?  But I know that a lot of the Academy screenings, like, a lot of people walk out because it's  just so bleak. 
[01:13:00]  And the last scene in the movie, like, when I saw it, like, you're just sweating the whole  movie.  And even though you don't really see anything in it, just hearing these people talk about  it and realizing it's real is, like, overwhelming.  And it's too much for a lot of people.  And the last scene is just so unbelievably intense.  Yeah.  And it's a real, like, it's a crazy movie.  How do you even decide to go like, yeah, let's have the actual killers.  Reenact.  Like, it seems like such a ridiculous idea.  It is.  But they're, like, tap dancing, like, and they're talking about how they killed everybody. 
[01:13:30]  And they're just...  The fact that they have no remorse.  And at some time, he doesn't interject very often, but the director, every once in a while,  would be like, but you know, like, there's a scene in the movie where the guy maybe starts  to realize that, like, what I did was wrong.  And he's like, because he's reenacting it.  And reenacting it was kind of hard for him.  And he's like, oh, I know what it's like now, what people felt when I was doing this.  And he's like, no, no, you were really killing them, not just pretending.  And he's like, no, I think I understand. 
[01:14:00]  And it's just like, oh, my God.  But it's a really...  Holy fuck.  It's a sort of once-in-a-lifetime kind of movie.  And so I think it's absolutely worth seeing, because I think it's pretty brilliant.  But it's just...  Sam's got the trailer going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just pretty wild.  It's pretty wild.  It is really twisted, man.  Cool.  Yeah, highly recommend that.  What other acting have you done?  This is pretty much it.  Is this really?  Yeah, I mean, it's one of these weird things where two of my friends put me in a movie  as, like, the idiot.  Yeah, yeah.  And then both those movies happen to do really well.  I am so fucking gonna get this on demand when I go home. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, it's a good movie.  I just want to say, it's like, ah, look.  It's a great movie.  It's about, like, it's in Chicago, and it's a craft...  My friend became obsessed with craft beer, which I don't even like craft beer, so...  And we all drank real beer the whole movie, so it was just, like, a headache all day long.  Oh, shit, right?  Uh-oh.  Does it taste like cheese?  Why?  It's fucking craft, cocksucker.  For more of the O.H. and Anthony Wars to the week, time to...  Next.  Comedy.  MMA.

The worst of the week countdown continues. 
[01:19:30]  Yes, indeed.  This is the worst of the week countdown.  And I am Sam Roberts bringing to you a digestible form of all the greatness that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, Anthony and his war against the towbooth workers of New York City.  Intern Jackie says goodbye.  Josh Gad is in studio.  Before we get to any of that, Anthony is making more aesthetic changes to his person.  He wants to look better.  He wants his smile to be brighter and whiter. 
[01:20:00]  So he's getting veneers.  He told us he is getting veneers.  We wanted to warn him of some of the ways that veneers can go wrong.  We had Rich Voss on the phone.  I hope he doesn't go through with it.  He probably will anyway.  It's Anthony and his veneers on the worst of the week countdown.  I went to the dentist yesterday.  I took a picture.  Right.  Boy, they really go all out.  What do you mean?  Go to my tweeter, I guess, and pop up the picture. 
[01:20:30]  It just says fun fun.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ew.  We look like Hannibal Lecter on the fucking...  Does that hurt?  Are you getting gas?  No.  Everyone thought I was getting gas, but I'm not.  That's just feeding me oxygen.  Right.  You know, love is like oxygen.  You get too much, you get too high, not enough, you're going to die.  Sure.  Going to die.  Love makes you high.  Anyway, they were feeding oxygen through there because what they were doing is removing 
[01:21:00]  amalgam.  They were moving the amalgam filling in a tooth, and it was a big one.  So what they do is, they put the dental dam in, so there's only one tooth poking through  the little rubber thing, so all that shit doesn't pour down your throat.  And then they give you the oxygen, and then there's a big funnel-y tube thing that is  a vacuum, and it's sucking the air away from your mouth because that mercury filling shit  gets in the air. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, wow.  So it's like you're cleaning out asbestos.  Wow.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Who thought it was a good idea for us to have this one with our kids?  Crazy.  So they started that process yesterday.  How many did they do?  Two.  And they got me a crown, a temporary crown, over here, and then I go back in a couple  weeks, and they do more work and shit.  When are you getting your horse teeth?  I'm not getting your horse teeth.  I'm getting what are called veneers. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no.  They're called veneers.  They go on the side of Vin's head.  Actually, it was a funny one.  Veneers.  They didn't have really white teeth?  No, that's just it.  Are you sure?  They make these things.  The hair thing worked out great for you, but don't come in here with horse teeth.  Dude, get him fucking Hollywood white.  Look, look.  Everyone's afraid because of Rich Voss.  We're all petrified from the Voss debacle. 
[01:22:30]  I'd rather have a mouth of rotting teeth than come in looking like he used to.  He got it fixed, finally.  He did.  But what they do with the veneers, they're matched color-wise to real teeth.  It's not like this white, stark thing.  They look amazingly natural and real.  Their veneers, they're fucking so thin, and they adhere to the fronts of your teeth.  Show me some veneers.  In a way that doesn't... 
[01:23:00]  And don't put veneer fucking faux pas on there.  Put epic fail and veneers.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, really?  Look what Snooki did.  I'm not going to be Snooki white.  That's horrible.  Is that really veneers?  They're too white.  No, it's way too fucking white.  It's too white.  That's dumb.  No, I don't think I'd ever hear you say that.  I have an amazing dentist now.  And, um...  See, her teeth were fine.  Why are we...  Dr. Zell.  Zell.  What a dope. 
[01:23:30]  And then they didn't even put them in right, because they're too wide or something.  It's a white angel.  No, I am getting veneers, and they are, um, very natural looking.  That's all I want.  That's what they're telling you.  No, it is.  I swear, I swear.  Yeah.  And, uh, so they're doing all the prelim work right now with taking care of all the  old silver fillings and shit.  And we don't have dental insurance.  No, this is all cash on the barrel head. 
[01:24:00]  Why can't we get dental insurance?  Like yesterday, what they did yesterday is she took the fillings out of two teeth.  Right.  She, um, filled them with the, uh, white, uh, filling stuff.  Sure.  And then put a cap, uh, or a, uh, crown.  A temporary crown.  And then I also paid for when I come back to put the, the permanent crown, because they  do the impression and everything.  Um, oh God.  And, uh.  See, more veneers.  Yeah, that's terrible.  No, that's just terrible.  That's like a Hollywood guy.  Yeah.  So you know he went to the best place. 
[01:24:30]  It was $2,300 for just that.  How to pocket.  Two teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  Just unbelievable.  I fucking hand my Amex over.  Yeah, put it on that.  Jesus.  Two teeth.  Two teeth.  That's why people.  And I got to fuck a load more to do.  That's why people let their teeth rot.  They can't afford it.  Can't afford it.  A lot of, most people don't have dental at this point, right?  The world needs ditch diggers too, you know.  Well, this is cosmetic.  No dental would cover this anyway.  Yeah, it's a cosmetic thing.  But, as a cosmetic procedure, I can probably write this shit off on my taxes. 
[01:25:00]  The government allows you that, Norton.  Because you go on TV.  Yeah.  Make sure when they give you novocaine, request benzatine.  That numbs the root.  Like the second half of that word.  Benzatine will numb the root.  I heard he grew up, though.  Yeah, you should be a benzatoddler.  I'm a fucking pussy with a dentist.  Yeah, S.  I am bad.  If they don't give you benzatine, a lot of times the root does not get numb properly and  you feel it halfway through.  So, say, I want benzatine. 
[01:25:30]  He might say, well, you don't need that.  Say, I'd like it, though.  It's not that it's, I don't even know if it's extra money.  It's like propofol.  Whatever.  It's like when you request.  No, no, no.  You request propofol.  Fuck, I don't want to be Michael Jackson.  No, no, no.  Not the same drug.  It's in a root canal.  But you have to ask for propofol.  They fucking hit yesterday, because it was two teeth on the bottom.  Right.  They hit that fucking back of the jawbone nerve with the novocaine.  You can't swallow anymore?  I would just scratch my head over my ear, and it's like, it's numb.  Half my head was numb. 
[01:26:00]  I wish you were scratching it with a pistol.  I was a numb skull.  But it fucking numbed it.  She was drilling, and they always say, like, if you feel any, you know, discomfort, let  me know.  And she's drilling away.  And then they get that big drill where it's like, you're going to feel some vibration.  And she goes, and it feels like the drill bit is spinning at, like, one RPM.  And it's just gouging shit out like an auger. 
[01:26:30]  Jesus.  You know, I...  Why are you making it worse?  Oh, sorry.  And then I just go on my Twitter.  This guy goes, they gas you.  I don't remember shit.  And it didn't hurt at all.  So, good.  By the way, I made up benzatine.  I don't think it exists.  Oh, that would have been funny if they were out.  All right.  I wanted them to ask for benzatine.  Do you get any benzatine?  You got any cyanide?  Jimmy says I should...  We got a hotline call coming in.  All right.  Rich Voss, what's up?  Hey, I hear you guys need dental advice or answer to that.  Oh, Jesus.  I have a great dentist.  I need no advice.  You're getting veneers? 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  Don't you think you should worry and maybe worry about your liver and not your teeth?  Okay.  I'm having my liver veneered.  Yes.  Right.  And it's some protection.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are you getting veneers?  Is that what all the high school kids are doing now?  Yeah, that's exactly it, Rich.  No, it's a less intrusive way.  It's for people that haven't been crackheads and had all their real teeth fall out of their 
[01:27:30]  fucking head.  I don't need to put screws in my gums to have teeth put in.  Don't get mad at me, midlife dental crisis.  Midlife dental crisis.  That's right.  I, I, I, first of all, veneers is just covering up.  You're covering up the pain.  No, it's not covering up the pain.  It is.  What do you...  It's covering up discoloration that has nothing to do with decay or anything.  It's not like, you know, we saw your teeth on that fucking, in that picture where you, 
[01:28:00]  you had cracked teeth.  We understand.  I understand why your teeth were the way they were.  What do you think it starts off with?  It starts off with discoloration.  Then it gets darker.  Then you marry her.  And your family hates you.  It starts off with discoloration.  No, it's discoloration that has nothing to do with that.  It's from, like, tetracycline when I was a kid.  Taking fucking archaic drugs so I didn't get zits.  Didn't work.  Terrible fuckers.  They didn't have Accutane back then, you pricks. 
[01:28:30]  Is Accutane good?  No, it's the best.  It boosts your cholesterol up to 12 million for six months.  But, uh, I tell you, Accutane is the shit.  It fucking just wipes it out.  But, you know, when you don't take it until you're fucking 35 years old, eh.  Yeah.  That's a good, like, the stuff you took when you were young, does that also make your hair fall out?  Like, that's why you had it.  So I can get fucking those, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  And it makes your dick like an elephant.  Yeah, smelly and gray.  Wow.  Holy shit.  No one's beating that today.  Oh, what can you do, Jimmy?  Holy fuck.  The worst is yet to come.

We keep moving on the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, counting down the greatness that happened on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:33:30]  Of course, this countdown replays throughout the weekend.  And the Sam Roberts show, I don't know if you know about this, airs at 4 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday right here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Vanessa Hudgens from Spring Breakers is in studio with me Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern, so check that out.  In the meantime, we've got to keep moving with this countdown before it passes us by.  We'll still get to Anthony and his war against the Tollboots.  We'll get to Josh Gaddon's studio. 
[01:34:00]  Right now, I want to play for you the single, most insane, ridiculous farewell to an intern celebration that's ever happened on this show.  The Opie and Anthony show is known for shitting all over their interns.  I mean, most interns leave here in tears.  It's a trail of tears that exit the Opie and Anthony studio.  But instead, we had some cute girls interning this semester, so we had to throw a party to tell them how much they meant to the show.  It's ridiculous, and it's got no place.  But I wanted to share that bizarreness with you right here on the countdown. 
[01:34:30]  It's intern Jackie and her last day.  Hi, girls.  Hi, Jackie.  Hi, Jackie's mom.  We were looking how you walk the same way.  You both walk down the hall the same way.  You laugh the same way.  You certainly are identical.  This is creepy.  Yeah.  We can make a lot of money from you two.  She didn't like the whole thing.  She what?  I'm sorry.  Mike?  What happened?  What?  You said she had more experience. 
[01:35:00]  She didn't.  Oh, well, you know, there's other alternative words to that that I really didn't want to say.  But, you know.  Yeah, we're nice people here.  Yeah, we have to be nice.  You know, I would, you know, I'd.  I would.  Oh, my God.  This is exactly.  I just want to say I would.  Jackie was petrified yesterday.  Well, I'm just saying I would.  That's a compliment.  That is a compliment.  I would.  Yeah.  You know, if things were different, I would.  If what was different?  If things. 
[01:35:30]  We had a few drinks.  Jackie was saying yesterday that she, if her mom was single, she'd be pretty worried about  bringing her here.  But you've been married 28 years?  Yeah.  29 in August.  29 in August.  You got married young, obviously.  20 right out of college.  Wow.  Are you going to do that, Jackie?  You think?  Get married right out of college.  Look at her mom begging.  It depends how this goes.  No, look at her mom shaking her head. 
[01:36:00]  No.  Don't like the boyfriend again?  Basically, she's saying, I made a huge mistake.  Don't do what I did.  Oh, my God.  I love you at all.  But don't follow my path.  You see her shaking her head?  Exactly.  Is your boyfriend the landscaper?  Yes, he is.  Is he cool?  Because Sidney's boyfriend, you know, didn't give off a cool vibe yesterday.  He might be nice.  He might be a good guy.  He might want to come in and be like, you're all lazy.  Be like a...  He'd be like a...  Yeah.  We heard Sidney's boyfriend was, as Iraq said, a dick. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  So, yeah, we don't want that for Jackie.  No.  No.  He's a great guy.  Is he a great guy?  He is.  You just wish he had a better job?  Don't do anything.  I just want him to be happy.  Oh, wow.  Whatever it is he loves to do.  Oh, this is so funny.  Oh, no.  So, yeah.  Just kidding.  Jackie's boyfriend.  Any future prospects for Jackie's boyfriend? 
[01:37:00]  No, just him.  As far as a job, I mean.  Oh, he does roofing right now.  Oh, okay.  But I mean, like...  So he could be a radio DJ.  Right.  That's true.  You know, giving some luck, a few twists and turns.  Yeah, that's nice.  You never know what'll happen.  Yeah, you never know what'll happen.  And, wow, that's pretty cool, though, your mom, being nice like that.  She could just say, oh, please, lose the bum.  Yeah, she could.  Get a guy with a real job or something. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, but she knows that would start me a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you guys argue a lot?  Mom-daughter arguments?  You know, they're typical, but...  Yeah.  Me too.  She's got a strong will.  We'll just say it that way.  Oh, she's very independent.  Very independent.  Yeah.  And a lot of clothes.  And a lot of clothes.  A lot of clothes.  She went the whole summer without a repeat.  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  It is.  It is impressive.  I own two pairs of jeans.  She's the one I get it from.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  A clothes as well.  Oh, yeah.  She is a lot of clothes. 
[01:38:00]  Close diva!  So, how's the Jackie Dad thing?  What's he all about?  The Jackie Dad thing is great.  Jackie is her father's baby.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I was a mistake, basically.  Oh, really?  He wanted three kids.  She only wanted two.  Oh, boy.  After six years, he got me.  So, it was pretty...  Uh-huh.  Well, the problem is, we weren't even supposed to have kids, or have her.  He went and had a vasectomy.  Oh, shit. 
[01:38:30]  And I found a week after that I was pregnant with her.  Yeah.  And I cried for nine months.  Wow.  And...  Holy shit, you're not supposed to be here.  I'll close in.  I know.  And he even cut his shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Just slipped one past the goalie right at the last minute.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Really?  It's not nice when you're young.  Right at the buzzer.  Your sister throws it in your face.  God, we would have had a real sad summer.  No one even wanted you. 
[01:39:00]  Exactly.  Oh, that's kind of sad.  And you cried for how long?  I cried the whole time.  The whole time?  Nine months, I cried.  Why not three?  I mean, two, three.  It's pretty much the same.  I wanted a third child.  And my husband said no.  We went on vacation.  There was a lot of little kids there.  And I came home, and I'm like, uh-uh.  I am so good.  Oh, no.  I sold everything.  Got rid of all the baby stuff.  Set him off to make sure we were done.  But now you couldn't imagine being without her, though. 
[01:39:30]  I know.  Exactly.  We're like twins.  You look exactly alike.  And you and the hubby, all good, right?  28 years.  All good.  That's a long time.  What's the secret to a long marriage?  Please tell us the secret to your success.  We don't actually live together during the week.  There you go.  That'll do it.  Is that true?  That is true.  Why?  He's got a job somewhere else?  Yeah.  He's out near Albany, and I'm in Rochester.  Wow.  That would make it better.  No, I shouldn't say that, because he's probably listening right now. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, no.  No, he's in a meeting, actually.  That's what he told me.  Oh, my God.  So.  Do you guys know the horrible questions you subjected my mother to?  No.  I didn't know any thought of that.  Are you remembering that now?  Yeah, no, no.  They're just...  I admit it.  I admit it.  I would.  That's a little edgy.  No.  That's a little edgy.  No, no, no.  Not even close.  Not even close.  Oh, it was pretty, yeah.  Jackie's gotten some very...  She's been treated very well here on her internship. 
[01:40:30]  And Sam.  Like every intern that's come before her, Sam.  No, just turn, Sydney.  Sam was an intern when he started with us years and years ago.  Many, many years ago.  And he's resentful that we finally decided, perhaps it's time we treat the interns a little  better than we have been.  I don't understand why he's so angry with that.  There's a third member of the intern class that is still treated like the old regime.  Speaking of which...  He happens to be a boy.  But speaking of which, have him come in.  Have him come in. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Have him come in so he can share in this joy.  Actually, he's coming in with Jackie's cake.  Ah, there it is.  Yay.  That's a cake.  That's Jackie's...  Thank you.  I think he's interning, too.  We're not really sure.  Isn't this terrible that twice he's had to bring balloons and cake in for other interns  that are leaving?  Yeah.  And knowing he will not get the same food when he leaves.  It's going to be bon voyage, sunny boy.  Whatever your name is. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, whatever your name is.  Right.  Oh, is this a good cake?  What does it say?  Yeah, we...  Wow, what does the cake say?  I told him to write something very nice.  No, Sam told me yesterday he asked if he could do a little funny mean joke.  What does it say?  And I said...  Well, that goes against what I wanted.  How dare you?  Now, you...  I mean, Roland said, okay, what should we make the cake say?  So I said, I'll tell you exactly what the cake should say.  And what does it say?  Jackie, this is completely ridiculous. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, no.  What are you talking about?  It is ridiculous that you're leaving.  It is.  It is.  Very good, Sam.  Sam, it's the perfect cake, Sam.  No!  Why would we want to get rid of someone that is so good?  That's ridiculous.  That's not what I meant.  No, that's...  It's absolutely what he meant.  I think so.  Good choice of words, Sam.  And we loved both our interns this summer.  Three.  But we might have liked Jackie a little bit more.  And with that, we got Ryan Starr outside the studio. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, yes.  Oh, you get a little more than Jackie.  You get a little more than...  Ryan...  A little more than Sidney.  Where's Ryan?  Yeah, cut that up.  Cut that cake up.  You know, Ryan...  Come on.  There he is.  Ryan Starr, everybody.  What's up?  That's Jackie.  And Jackie's mom.  And Jackie's mom.  How are you doing, Jackie?  How are you?  Jackie's our intern, and she's leaving.  We're devastated.  Ryan Starr shaved his head.  What the hell? 
[01:43:00]  New image.  You know?  Jesus.  The new year.  Clarity.  Clarity.  Yeah, yeah.  Starting fresh.  He's got a new record out.  What is it called?  Released an EP called Animals.  Yes.  EP called Animals.  He's doing it all himself.  He said, fuck the record company.  Nice.  That's what people are doing now.  Right?  Screw them shysters.  They get in the way of the shave in the head and the vision.  You know what I mean?  Right?  I could never do this on a corporate, you know, corporate watch.  You cut your hair? 
[01:43:30]  God forbid.  That was in page number 623 of the contract.  Oh, I missed that one.  And a guitar.  Yeah.  Could you, like, serenade Jackie on our last day?  Because, you know, Sidney got to send off with just a song.  Right.  We decided Jackie really went over the top.  Why not get Ryan Starr to serenade you on your last day here?  Yes, please, Ryan, if you will.  What are you talking about?  Ryan, do you have a sweet song, maybe?  A sweet song for Jackie.  And Jackie's mom, who's very, very doable. 
[01:44:00]  Jackie.  I mean, who's a very nice lady.  The best in your turn ever.  I got to say, it's always interesting on the road because it's fitting your mom is here.  Because I've been at shows where moms are holding signs of, like, I don't know why moms are there.  But they say my daughter just turned 18 or whatever.  Oh, man.  It's really, it's wacky out there.  It is like an offering.  Yes.  And you never know.  And then it's funny because I'm getting, you know, I'm in my 30s now. 
[01:44:30]  So it's not like I'm 18.  So it's still very young.  So, like, I can't tell who I'm supposed to be attracted to.  The 40-year-old mom or, like, that 20-year-old mom.  Oh, man.  See?  Go both ways.  My friends say both.  Oh, both ways.  Yeah, both.  Both.  Jackie, you shouldn't talk like that.  Very good.  No, no.  It's a good thing your mom's here.  This is for Jackie.  Amazing.  Jump right into a nice little send-off song.  Yeah.  This is for Jackie.  Should I hit a chorus?  Should we just get right to the point? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  This is a...  Clock's marching at the double time.  Every dollar has become a dime.  Heart's breaking at the speed of sound.  You're falling down all around.  Oh, oh.  Bombs lighting up the eastern sky.  The back room deals in the bottom line.  The earth's shaking, but we don't know why.  A million fires, oceans rise.  Oh, oh.  I leave it all when I feel you near.  What I'm saying is I need you here. 
[01:45:30]  Even though love never seems to last.  If you think we got a chance.  Stay a while.  Oh, you got to stay a while.  Oh, oh.  These days are wild.  Jackie, won't you stay a while?  I drop the needle on the bell brigade. 
[01:46:00]  We slow dance till the moonlight fades.  I tell me now that you never leave.  You always stay here with me.  Oh, oh.  I'll keep you safe from the circus show.  The bullshit and the blowing smoke.  The knife hidden under every sleeve.  They stab your back.  They watch you bleed.  Oh, oh.  They're going to tell you what you want to hear.  Like, I could make you a star next year.  Well, if New York City's lights are so bright.  How come so many people crying tonight? 
[01:46:30]  Stay a while.  Oh, you got to stay a while.  Jackie, won't you stay a while?  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, oh.  I'll let your hair fall around your face.  I would kill just to keep you safe.  Put your body next to mine.  Sorry, mom.  Just let go and close your eyes.  I shiver when I feel your skin.  Like a sinner who's been forgiven.  Go on, baby.  Shine your light.  Because no one's going to find us here tonight.  Stay a while.  Oh, you got to stay a while. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, yo, oh, oh.  These days are wild.  Jackie, won't you stay a while?  Oh, I'll let your hair fall around your face.  Whoa.  Wow.  Jackie.  That's crazy.  Where are you going?  She's just going.  My cheeks are shaking.  That's amazing. 
[01:48:00]  She's just going back to ranch house now.  That reminds me of another intern send-off from, I don't remember.  Remember when we?  No.  There was that intern.  Yeah, we've been serenading the interns for many, many years now.  There's a rock star singing a ballad to an intern begging her to stay.  Oh, my God.  I know.  What's happening?  She said it.  She said it.  Actually, I'm looking for an intern.  Oh.  Really?  Must have passport.  I have a passport. 
[01:48:30]  What is going on?  Wow.  It sounds like an abduction.  And no record.  No criminal record.  No criminal record.  Oh, that might be a problem.  No.  No, there's not.  It's too bad Ryan Star looks like a serial killer right now.  That would sound like a great proposition.  Nothing.  I go back to school, and that's about it.  School.  Yeah, I can put that off.  See?  School.  I don't really need school.  I'm teeing her up.  I'm teeing her up for a job.  All right.  Oh, man.  How did this go for you?  Did you learn a lot? 
[01:49:00]  Did they teach you all their wisdom?  I did.  Yeah, they taught me all their wisdom.  I learned a lot.  What?  Sam learned a lot.  You're really holding a grudge from your internship.  It was a different experience.  Sam has the feeling that perhaps we didn't treat him as nicely when he was an intern.  Or any other intern.  Or as we treat Jackie.  It's not just me.  I speak for every intern that ever interned here.  What are you talking about?  Any step for Jackie.  What are you, the Martin Luther King of interns?  Yes.  Come on.  Speak for everybody. 
[01:49:30]  We've always been nice to the interns.  We've judged the interns on the content of the character.  Not the beauty of, I mean, the color of their skin.  He had a dream.  Paid lunches.  Ryan Starr with the new record, man.  That's cool, brother.  Yeah, man.  The band and I, we've been touring for like four, when I first met you guys.  It was just me and my acoustic guitar, you know.  But since then, we've put together a great band.  You know, this is all well and good, but we're getting a little too far away from the fact that Jackie is leaving.  Yeah.  You know, Jackie's mom didn't come down from Rochester. 
[01:50:00]  She won Rochester.  Huh?  Is that where you're from, Rochester?  Yeah.  Yes.  They're rough and tough there, man.  You got a song for Jackie's mom?  I don't want her to feel like that.  Maybe a new song from Animals.  I don't know.  This one.  Is it appropriate for Jackie's mom?  Yeah, let's do it.  Or does she have to do earmuffs?  All right.  Earmuffs.  Jackie's mom, you ever break up with someone?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Break up, man.  It's the coolest breakup song, I think. 
[01:50:30]  I think, you know, it's tough to write a breakup song when you're a dude.  So this is the dude breakup song, I guess.  It's for Jackie's mom.  Dad or I got a song called Psycho Suicidal Girl, if that's more you.  No, we're good.  We're good.  We're good.  She says.  She's not too picky.  I usually say that for the Jersey girls, not the Rochester girls.  And this is off the EP Animals?  This is off the EP Animals.  We made a pretty hot video for it, actually.  You can go on YouTube or Vivo or whatever right now. 
[01:51:00]  Appropriate for Jackie's mom to watch?  It's got a steamy pool scene.  Uh-oh.  We actually, we were in this house in Connecticut, this really rich, ritzy house.  It's kind of like this bling ring style thing where these kids rob this house.  And it turns into, you know, it's a hot video.  It turns into a party, right?  It turns into a little party.  Jackie's mom, you know.  Would you?  Oh, my God.  He would, right?  All right, all right.  Let's get to it.  Let's play music now.  Here you go.  Oh, my. 
[01:51:30]  Was that comfortable for both of us?  Oh, right.  He was, though.  And you called me on the phone to say there's nothing to talk about.  I wish you'd stop your crying long enough just to hear me out.  Oh, we are, we are just what we are.  Yeah, I'm not proud of all the things that I've been putting you through. 
[01:52:00]  When I shot up at the sky, I didn't know it'd fall down on you.  Take it all back.  Take it all back.  Take it all back.  Take it all back.  I didn't mean to make you suffer.  I didn't mean to make you cry.  I just want to put this back together.  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible. 
[01:52:30]  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible.  I know this life we're dealing with is getting under your skin.  If we can make it through the winter, we can fall in love again.  Oh, we are, we are just what we are. 
[01:53:00]  And all these days it's just too easy to be calling it quits.  But a life without you would be too hard to find happiness.  Take it all back.  Take it all back.  Take it all back.  I didn't mean to make you suffer.  I didn't mean to make you cry.  I just want to put this back together.  This isn't impossible. 
[01:53:30]  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yo, walk the city streets and it's really freaking me out.  Cause every corner is a memory.  That one day I'll write you about.  You cut my wings and left me here all alone. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I'm sorry I'm a little bit angel and a little bit animal.  I didn't mean to make you cry.  I just want to put this back together.  This isn't impossible.  This isn't impossible.  It's impossible 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah  It's impossible  It's impossible  It's impossible  Yeah, yeah  Oh, yeah  That's great  Remember a time your mom was in, Sam 
[01:55:00]  And we had a rock star come in  You know what happened  Jackie's mom, I'll tell you  Last semester, our prize intern  The number one intern in the class  You know how he left?  He got a great send-off too  Yeah, he got his eyebrows shaved  And then we threw him out the door  It was the weekend, we had to get home  Yeah, we weren't very busy  There was not really much time  And there wasn't even a rock star to sing to him  Or anything while he was getting shaved  No, he was getting his eyebrows shaved  Now I get to retweet that video 
[01:55:30]  Thanks, Sam  You got ice  Well, Jackie  You know  Sounds like you should stick around  What more can we say?  Good thing I have to pack up the car today  Oh, man  Do you need help?  What?  My last day of my internship  Yeah  I went to Hooters with Travis  One of the worst meals of my life  Sounds like a party  I've seen all the different clothes she wears  And the boxes are going to be heavy  And of course Jackie's mom's not going to be able to handle the big heavy boxes 
[01:56:00]  So I figure maybe I should lend a hand  I guess you're feeling helpful  Of course  That's what a gentleman does  Yeah, I know  But we're not talking about a gentleman  Who's replacing Jackie?  Oh, God  No one replaces Jackie  There is no one  I mean, there'll be someone in her place  But no one will replace Jackie  Can we possibly grab a ray of sunshine  And bring it in the building?  I think not  So replace?  No 
[01:56:30]  No  No  It would be hilarious, though  If we got two more cute girls next semester  And they would just  It would be like who?  Yeah  What?  What is it?  Remember Sidney?  Who is he?  Oh, we've cut the cake  We've serenaded Jackie  Oh, God  And her mom  It's much later than we would have stayed  In any other circumstance  He stayed late  On a Friday  On a Friday before vacation  And the voice  The glasses  I'm just 
[01:57:00]  I'm happy to be here  Nobody else  I'd probably pull myself out of bed  That's not  See?  Look at that, Jackie  He's not talking about Alice  He's talking about you  Oh, just Jackie  Oh, no, Jackie  I'm going to stop smiling  I'm glad  It was beautiful  Who was he talking about her?  Isn't it amazing?  I'm going to give it to her  I am  Jackie's mom  Did I get you  Go on a little bit?  And you guys  A little bit, right?  A little bit  Seeing your daughter being serenaded by a rock star  All right  Cool, man  And  I don't know  Wow, we're going on a little vacation  So we'll see you 
[01:57:30]  Do we have another song for Jackie?  Yes, we do  Oh, we do?  What?  Which one are we going with?  She just got serenaded  You know the song Jackie Blue  Jackie's mom, right?  No  They played it for me yesterday  Ooh, Jackie Blue  That one?  I don't think I know that one  What kind of music do you like?  I like all sorts of music  Very  But that one  I'm not sure  Do you like my music?  Maybe it's just  How about mine?  How about you start with  I like Ryan Starr  Ryan Starr  Definitely top 
[01:58:00]  I've always been good with moms  When I was a kid  If my friends were going to a party  It was like  Is Ryan going to be there?  And if Ryan was there  Then they were like  Allowed to go to the party  Yeah  That was  That was my early days  Learning mom's circuit  A little hippie-ish mom  Back in the day, no?  Yeah, I think she was  A little bit?  She just hides it from me  Really?  Yeah, I find out some things lately  Do you go in the backyard  And sneak a little weed?  Yeah  You see the look she gave?  What do you want to know about your mom? 
[01:58:30]  This is what I just recently found out  At a wedding  Because, yeah  What do you want to know  What do you want to know about your mom?  We could get it out of her  No, that was the exact one right there  Oh, you're wondering about that  That smile set it off for me  All right  What's the song for Jackie?  We'll just play it  As we end the show  Oh, okay  E-Rock picked this  It's not the one from yesterday, right?  No  You and I talked about it  Early in the week  See  What?  Are you  What?

[02:04:30]  Still to come is going to be Anthony and his war against the tollbooths  But, well, the workers in the tollbooths  He's not actually warring with the structures themselves  Well, you get what I'm saying  Josh Gad was in studio this week  You know Josh Gad  He was in Book of Mormon  He's been on the show a bunch of times  He was in White House sitcom  Well, now he's in Jobs  The movie about Steve Jobs  Where he plays Steve Wozniak  Which is Steve Jobs' right-hand man  As he's starting Apple  Ashton Kutcher, of course, plays Steve Jobs 
[02:05:00]  But Ashton Kutcher wasn't here  No! Our buddy, Josh Gad, was  He was hilarious  You don't believe me?  Listen for yourself  Number two  Number two  Are you really playing Sam Kinison?  I really am playing Sam Kinison  Because you've got a lot of Sam Kinison fans in the studio  I know, I do  I'm terrified about it  He's one of my favorites of all time  He's one of my favorites of all time  That's a big fucking, like  Don't even get me started  I know, I'm just saying  I've already started drinking a lot of tea and honey 
[02:05:30]  And taking throw lozenges  Yeah  The screaming alone is brutal  But, no, I'm really super terrified, excited  My first experience was  My brother was a huge Kinison fan  And so he shows me this movie when I'm like 10 years old  It's this Rodney Dangerfield film  And I'm looking at it  And it's really funny  And then all of a sudden  This force of nature comes on  It's like the first time I realized  What a scene stealer was  Yeah  And I was like  Who's this guy?  And then I started to watch his HBO specials 
[02:06:00]  And I started to see, you know  All this stuff  And Wild Thing  And everything else  And then listened to his Stern stuff  And I was just like  This is a force of nature  It's a guy that kind of redefined comedy  You know, I think for a lot of comedians  And so it's terrifying to fill those shoes  That Dangerfield special was huge  Oh my god  It was just like  It was crazy  Everyone else that was on that one  Go fuck yourself  Who else was on his?  I mean, I know on Dice  There was a great movie  And there were a few other people  That I think actually 
[02:06:30]  Was Roseanne on the same one  Kinison was on?  She might have been  I think she finished off  I think you might be right  Yeah  And my favorite about that thing  Was that Rodney would warn people about  Like it always came with a disclaimer  Yes  It was never just  Yeah  Here's another comic  It was always like  You gotta be prepared for this guy  It's gonna fuck your mind  Boy, that's some big shoes to fill right there  Yeah, thank you guys  Thanks for making me feel really  But you know  You can take solace in the fact that  You just look at what Michael Chiklis did  After the Belushi thing 
[02:07:00]  That he did  Oh, he didn't work for ten years  Yeah, no  That makes me feel a lot better  Makes me feel a lot better  You can do a commish  I, uh, yeah  That's good  Oh my god  That's great  I'm gonna have a ten year respite  From acting  How are you preparing?  Are you doing stand up?  I'm not, I'm just gonna  Yeah  I'm gonna go do some stand up  I'm gonna  Larry Charles  Who is the director of Borat  And the director of  Kind of all of Sasha Cohen's stuff  Is directing the movie  And he comes from that world 
[02:07:30]  Um, so he's hooking me up  With a lot of, uh  Wow  A lot of amazing  Are you gonna grow your hair out  Or are you gonna wear a wig?  I'm gonna try to grow my hair out  And then  Alright  Alright  And, you know  I also just lost a ton of weight  For a movie  So I have to  Oh man  Put the weight back  It's gonna be an interesting ride  We're not filming  Probably for another  Six months to a year  Okay  So I've got time  But, uh, it's  It's gonna be a lot  Is this, uh  Yeah, script's great  It's written by Rich Rose  And what, uh, what does it cover  In Sam's, like, life 
[02:08:00]  I can't really talk about it  Right now  Oh, you can  You're just not allowed  Of course you can  You do have vocal cords  Don't you, man  But it's, uh  You can if you wanna be a pussy  But it's, it's gonna be  Yeah  Which I am  I've been called that a lot  In fact, by my daughter  This morning  Uh, and no  It's gonna cover a nice  Chunk of time  And it's gonna be  A great introduction  To people who didn't know Sam  Yeah  And it's gonna be  A great reminder  To people who did know him  Are you gonna talk to people  Who knew him?  Like, I am  I'm already sorry 
[02:08:30]  I spoke to, uh, yeah  Alan Stevens  And, um, you know  I already spoke to Robin Williams  And, and  It's just kind of getting a feel  From, like, uh  All of his contemporaries  Of what it was like  I mean  There's stories about him  Walking into clubs  With, like, a loaded gun  It's just like  You see some comics  Who are actually terrified  Of playing  Yeah, yeah  In the same club as him  Because it was just  No shit  He was a force of nature  And he was dangerous  He was just a dangerous  Real life dangerous  Not funny  No, real life dangerous  Is right  Yeah, yeah  Are you gonna take anal 
[02:09:00]  Are you gonna take anal nitrate?  I am gonna take anal nitrate  Actually  I call it anal nitrate  I'm going to take anal nitrate  Anal nitrate  Okay  Again  And what about Carl LeBeau  You gotta talk to him  I'm planning on talking to him  Yeah  That's very cool  There's, there's a lot of work  To be done  Jimmy Schubert  He's gonna remind me  Used to go with those guys  You gotta hook me up  With some of these guys  You know  Yeah, I know some of the guys  I only met him once  Um  What was that like  I was doing an open mic  At Rascals  While he was headlining  The main room  And so Ward Magnuson 
[02:09:30]  The guy who ran the club  Brought Sam out  To meet some of the  Younger comedians  And it was funny  Because he staggered out  Like he was too drunk  To talk  And we're like  Oh fuck  But uh  Then he's just like  Fucking around  And he stood there  For five minutes  And just  I don't even remember  What he said  I got him to sign a napkin  He was really nice  Sounds like a scene  For the movie, Jim  Actually  What if that's the entire  What if the entire movie  Covers it from Jim's point of view  It's like that day  That Sam fucked him over  But signed a napkin  And he talked for a little while  Yeah  I think it's  That's  We may have to do some rewrites  Five minutes of his life 
[02:10:00]  Yeah  But yeah  So I'm doing that  Stretched out to 90 minutes  I'm doing that  And then I'm playing  Steve Wozniak  And pretty much  I just wanna  I just wanna do  Kind of people  Who were important  In the 1980s  Right  There you go  I'm gonna do like  A collection of films  About guys  That's good  Alan Thicke  You're gonna play  Alan Thicke  He's very important  In the 80s  Yeah  Yes  Double threat  A singer and actor  It says here  Josh plays  Steve Wozniak  Comma  In Jobs  And then it says later 
[02:10:30]  He will portray  Steve Wozniak  Alongside Ashley Kutcher  As Steve Jobs  In the biopic Jobs  Oh again  Yeah it's good  To have it twice  Yeah I just want  They wanted you guys  To know  In case you didn't  Read the first bulletin  Yes  That I'm playing  Steve Wozniak  A.K.A. The Woz  You're the godfather  Of Bryce Dallas Howard  No I'm not her godfather  Because we're the same age  I'm her children's godfather  Oh okay  Because  Of course that's wrong  Oh okay  And Seth Gabriel's son Theo  Seth Gable  Yeah  Oh I'm sorry  Her husband and I 
[02:11:00]  Have known each other  Since we were  Five years old  We've been best friends  And so  I've been fortunate enough  To know them  Let's be serious though  It's not hard to be  Best friends at five  What do you got  A fucking matchbox car  You're my best friend  No we had a drug problem  That we both had to  Help each other get out  Okay that then  We uh  Anal nitrates  Anal nitrates  So dope  Yeah  Right  You played  Warren  I'm bored to death 
[02:11:30]  Was that the boyfriend  Who came back  And was uh  She was fucking  Her ex-boyfriend  Yeah  Oh my god  Jimmy was in that  Yeah I was  Playing like the next episode  Or whatever  Did you like  Did I leave an impression  I remember  I remember that  I was in a tank top  And I'm fucking her  Taking her from behind  In bed  As Schwartzman  Like it's like really  Yes  I believe it was  We did a table read  There was three episodes  We read  And that was  You probably had to read  The same day I was  Because you guys  Went through it before  I don't know how I know  That but I do  I think I read it 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  I left an impression  You did  I'm very excited about this  Yeah Warren  It's a funny god damn scene  It was a good scene  But uh  The Woz  Now you're playing  The Woz  I'm playing  The Woz  Did you meet The Woz  No I didn't  We reached out to him  Steve Wozniak  Is consulting on another  Jobs film  So  Oh  It was one of those  One where Brad Pitt  Is playing him  I hear  That's right  He's getting a little  Closer to that movie  Yeah  He demands that Brad Pitt  Plays him  Jimmy 
[02:12:30]  Is he  Legitimately concerned  Really that's  No I didn't get a chance  To meet him  But I adore him  I feel like I've met him  Because God knows  I've done enough research  To figure out his gate  His speaking pattern  And everything else  But he's an amazing guy  I mean  Isn't it just  Like the history  Of those guys  And what they did  On the level  They did it  True entrepreneurship  And just having  An amazing idea 
[02:13:00]  Like that  Not only having  An amazing idea  But like  To build that shit  In a garage  Right  And then to like  Just have the capacity  To make  What literally  Was a mom and pop shop  And turn it into  A billion dollar  Fortune 500 empire  Is crazy  And my knowledge  Of the legacy  Of jobs  And Apple in particular  Was everything  Kind of post iPod  That was kind of  My reference point  For it all  And I was very young  When you know  The other stuff  Was happening  Most people  Only know  Yeah  And you forget 
[02:13:30]  That he was  Fired from Apple  A man who was  Synonymous with Apple  Was fired from the company  And then came back  Only years later  After he was at Next  Which to  Huge victory  Huge victory  Like he fucking  Came back  And changed  Changed everything  But that's the thing  It's one of the  Great redemption stories  And it's not  And it's  It's never framed  That way  It's always framed  The cult of jobs  Is framed  As kind of  This thing  That existed  In this box 
[02:14:00]  That was  You know  That  Everything that we  Now know  The iPod  The iPad  The revolution  Of music  And everything  That kind of  Came before that  Is in many ways  To my generation  At least  A forgotten footnote  There was some  Kind of a time  Where Apple  Was looked at  As more of  The hippie-ish  Kind of  That's right  And artsy-fartsy  Thing  You remember  That little  Blue  The little  Blue  Egg  Kind of  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's kind of  I want that  On my desk  Man  And being like  What is that 
[02:14:30]  Yeah  Yeah  It's a Mac  I'm like  I'd rather have  The square white  Tower that runs  Windows on my  Computer  On my desk  And stuff  And then  When he came  Back  And they started  Branching out  Into other things  Than just  And then only  Computing  And phones  And what not  It just changed  Everything  Well that's what  It was for me  Is I remember  Somebody introducing  The iPod to me  And I realized  That this device  Could be fully  Integrated  With all of these  Other devices  And it just  Created such  Simplicity  And ease  For somebody 
[02:15:00]  Who's not a  Techie like myself  And it was  It was amazing  Because I had  Always been a  Windows guy  And I was terrified  Of making that leap  And then my  My wife was like  You know  You gotta try  This Mac thing  And I've never  Gone back  And now  Have every Apple  Device available  To man  Yeah  It really is  Amazing  And there are  Two whole  Different things  With Jobs  Beginning  Before his return  And after  What was the  Crossover that  Made it  Mainstream  What was the  Thing  The iPod  The iPod  That's huge  But you were right  Only really 
[02:15:30]  Hit people  Got the Mac  What was the  Crossover  It finally went  Okay now it's  Mainstream  I'll tell you  Exactly when it was  I remember  Coming to LA  In like  2003 after college  And seeing this  Giant billboard  Of a silhouette  Dancing on  Sunset Boulevard  And I remember  Going what the  Hell is that  Thing  And that's when  I realized that  It had become  Something else  That it had  Become this  Pop culturally  Relevant thing  That it had  Otherwise been  A very niche  Marketplace  If you remember 
[02:16:00]  Before the iPods  Discman  You still walked  Around with a  Physically moving  Motorized thing  On your arm  With your  Idiot  You do don't you  You changed  But you have  The audio  Cassette one  You actually have  A portable record  Player that you  Walk around  With  I had a  Discman  He literally  Only plays  In your eyes  On a boombox  Walking down  The street  Holding it over  His head  Trying to find  Love  Double cassette  As long as  You didn't move  The Discman  Worked perfectly  As long as 
[02:16:30]  You didn't  Fucking move  A muscle  Your music  Collection had  To physically  Be carried  With you  Either cassettes  Or discs  Or what not  And when you  Finally really  Thought about  This little  Fucking thing  Is holding  So many songs  Instantly accessible  You're not  Changing things  How many songs  It changed the game  How many songs  Was the first  Two  It was two songs  Two songs  Very  A and B  And they were  Yes  No the thing  Was is that  I remember even  Getting an early  Generation mp3 player 
[02:17:00]  And being like  I wanted to  Right  I wanted to like it  But I could never  Wrap my head around it  I'm like it's too complicated  Very complicated  To get songs on it  To use it  It wasn't  The interface  Wasn't very friendly  They really figured it out  And it was  Thank you  You really figured  Oh wait a minute  I appreciate that  You play the guy  Wow  Seriously  I don't think  Woz had much to do  With the iPod  How much  When did Woz  Like  Kind of break off  From that whole thing  Well interestingly enough 
[02:17:30]  We don't really show  This part in the film  But Steve Wozniak  Was in a plane crash  In the early 80's  And really severe  He was flying the plane  And he suffered  Like memory loss  Jesus  For about a month  And it kind of  Changed him  Completely  In a way  That he stepped away  From Apple  And he decided  That he wanted to  Pursue  More kind of  Personal goals  Like teaching  And he did  That music festival  That people forgot about  That was like  Oh remember that thing 
[02:18:00]  That's right  He did this crazy music festival  Twice actually  And so he  Started to go off  On his own  He developed one of the first  Universal remotes  And like that's  He just kind of  Went after his own  Niche in life  How much of that  Apple cash  Did he wind up  Skating away with  Not as much  As you would think  He was a  He's a very generous person  So  He gave away  A lot of his  Money to people  Who worked on the team 
[02:18:30]  With him  Who were otherwise  Kind of left in the dust  And that's kind of  One of the other  Unsung heroic things  That he did  That people don't really know  Well Steve Jobs  Meanwhile just kept  Every penny  And I hear  Kicked homeless people  Yep  As he was walking down  The street  I had heard that  He kicked marsupials  He went to  He went down under  And he hurt marsupials  Because they're one of  The cutest pieces  But I had never heard  About the homeless people  That hurts  That bothers me  Terrible  Terrible  The marsupials  Yeah  That really bothers me  Wow  That's 
[02:19:00]  And as far as  As far as  Casting goes  Yeah  A lot of people  Thought it was  Kind of a weird  Choice  Well then they're  Dick's aren't they  Well  Yeah  But like  Ashton  Ashton  Ashton  He didn't like it  You know  Ashton  Is  Fucking uncanny  I mean  If you hold up  A picture  Of young Steve Jobs  To a regular picture  Of Ashton Kutcher  Before he's even  Makeup  It's pretty creepy  How similar  They are 
[02:19:30]  Nor ever thought that  Until it was done  Until it was done  In fact  I don't know that  You can find somebody  In Hollywood  That looks as much  As Steve  So it kind of  Yes it was kind of like  Oh well it's the guy  From Two and a Half Men  But at the same time  It's kind of a genius move  Because people don't expect it  And having seen the film  Three times now  I can tell you that  He does an astounding job  In it  He's really remarkable  But he also just  Physically resembles the man  In a way  That's really cool  Yeah  And you know  He's an A-lister  He's an A-lister 
[02:20:00]  He's making a lot more money  Than the four of us combined  Oh man  You'd be surprised  What my salary is  Your salary couldn't drip out  That's arguably  The best cunty wife line  In the history of television  Alice I don't want my salary  To leak out  Your salary couldn't drip out  Fucking what a lightning strike  That was  It really was genius  So when are people  Going to be able to see this  August 16th 
[02:20:30]  August 16th  Yes  A week from tomorrow  A week from tomorrow  A week out  It's a great movie  It's really inspirational  And I think people are going to  Yeah  And this leads up to  How far in Mr. Job's life there  It leads up to his bar mitzvah  It's  Oh wow  That's the early years  A lot of people don't even know  That he was Jewish  Early on  Oh wow  No it leads up to  The launch of the iPod  Oh okay  You say iPad  Very funny  iPod  Okay  That's the British way  Of saying iPad 
[02:21:00]  Cheasing of course sir  iPod  iPod  So yeah  And then I got a film  Coming out in September  Called thanks for sharing  With Mark Ruffalo  Gwyneth Paltrow  And Tim Robbins  That is also really amazing  Oh what's that out  Sex addiction  Ah  Oh really  Why are you looking at Jimmy  Jimmy Norton  Because I saw him get a little  Twinkle in his eye  When I said it  I wasn't consulted  On this film  Yeah  You should have been  You should have been  You should have been  You pulled the waz on us  You're consulting on another  Sex addiction film  Yes I am  On a competing sex addiction film 
[02:21:30]  And then I'm doing a movie  With Kevin Hart  Oh cool  Now you're just bragging  I am  And then I'm  And then I'm going to  Go away to Costa Rica  And buy a home  What are you doing  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to  Jam with the stones  Doing a movie  With Kevin  Called Golden Tux  Which is basically  My guy  Is this guy  Who's about to get married  And his fiance  Wants him to have  As many groomsmen  As she has bridesmaids  And he has no friends 
[02:22:00]  So he has to hire  A consulting firm  Called Best Man Incorporated  That Kevin Hart runs  To basically hire  All my groomsmen  To pretend to be my friends  It's going to be  Really genius  And the script  Is one of the  Funniest scripts  I've ever read  Rom-com  Rom-com  It's a rom-com  You're going to be  Pretty much lead guy  In a rom-com  I am  Hence this staggering  Weight loss  That is pretty cool  They don't let fat people  Have love stories  I found out  I found out the hard way  Unless at the end  Gwyneth Paltrow  Makes the speech  About how beauty 
[02:22:30]  Is only skin deep  That's right  They couldn't even give  The fucking fat lady  In the movie  The speech that meant something  In shallow hell  In shallow hell  It should be shallow Hollywood  They had to give it  To the good looking woman  It's just amazing  That industry  They were too scared  That said  I would much rather hear  It from Gwyneth Paltrow  So I realized  I would have just  Shut up fatty  And thrown oats at her  How much weight  Did you lose?  I lost 30 pounds  I actually had to lose it  For the Zach Braff movie  That I'm working on now too  So it was just kind of  And then I've got to 
[02:23:00]  Put it all back on  For Kenison  So it's great  My heart is like  This is fucked up life  You're living this  It's like make a decision  Yeah it's make a decision  Exactly  You do a lot of  Fucking film work man  Book of Mormon was good to you  Book of Mormon was great to me boys  That was the launching pad  Remember when you guys were like  You're going to fucking fail  And I said to you  No I'm not  I'm not  Trust me  And look at me now  This is the third time  You've had me on  Something's going right bitches  He's just come back here to gloat  We still talk about Book of Mormon  We were just blown away by that  Let's sing a song together 
[02:23:30]  From the show  I'd love to  How many generations  Are they in now?  How many generations?  Meaning it was you  Then someone took over for you  Has someone now taken over for that guy?

[02:28:00]  Stepped on the gas  And fucking  Blasted through  Is he actually a cop  Or is he  They're technically cops  Yeah  Technically  Right  So you know  I just fucking went around  And apparently  It hit their message boards  And all this shit  And all these  Fucking bridge and tunnel guys  Are like  Oh  Bolo  Bolo  Be on the lookout  Bolo  Ew  Yeah yeah yeah  Ew  Be on the lookout  Anthony Coombe  Driving a black escalade  So for a while 
[02:28:30]  I was taking the  The old  Queensborough bridge  You know  Kind of  Kind of  Dodging them  And that worked  For a while  And I  Started going back  To the tunnel  Which worked  For a while  I was on the lam  From the fucking  Midtown tunnel  From the MTA police  Yes  From the bridge and tunnel  Cops  And  Well this morning  I'm coming through  And  And you know  Sometimes I guess  They're fucking bored 
[02:29:00]  So they just stand there  Looking at everyone's vehicle  For what they could  Pick away at  And hassle the people  That are just going to work  In the morning  So  I pull up to the gate  And he  Steps in front of me  He's like  Go over to that area  Right there  Go over to that area  Cause  Any reason  You didn't signal  For that lane change  Dude  Who has not  First of all  In the toll plaza area 
[02:29:30]  Changed lanes  The fucking  If  If  One line is too long  And you look  You just go into  The other lane  It's  It's kind of a  No man's land  Over there  Well I haven't done it  Without signal  Shut it  Yeah  So  So that's what he  Got me for  And then he comes  Over to  The vehicle  And  He's like  Roll  Roll your windows down  So I  Beep  Beep 
[02:30:00]  He goes  Roll the back windows down  Like  That's as far as they go  Cause they  They don't go all the way down  You know  It's a fancy vehicle  Probably not one that you're used to  You rat  So uh  He looks in my  Truck  He's  Peeking around  And uh  License  Registration  And proof  Of insurance  So uh  I get all the shit out  And  Unfortunately  My registration  Is up there  On my 
[02:30:30]  Counter  At home  Oh  And  Hey  You want it from me  It's registered  I mean  It's fucking registered  And the sticker thing  Isn't up there  Says you  Says me  And uh  And I can't stand  Insurance companies  These days  It's like  Your fucking  Insurance cards  Expire every  Two weeks  Every two weeks  It's like  Fucking  Why  What is this  I get a new one  Where is it  It used to be  Hey  I paid for my 
[02:31:00]  Year of insurance  Here's my  Years  My card  For a year  And you  Fucking take it out  The next year  You get a new one  Now it's all  Willy nilly  Who the fuck  Knows when they  Give it to you  I've used that  Excuse before  Yeah  It's not an excuse  My homework  I did my homework  I left it at home  But I did it  Yeah  Alright  She said the dog  Get your insurance card  Yeah  Your wife ate my  Insurance card  Should have told him  Fucking prick  Yeah so uh

[02:32:30]  You know  I didn't show my  My Reggie  I didn't show my  My insurance  And the other one  Is failure  To signal  Lane change  So much paper there  Yeah  But aren't two of them  Like if you  Prove that you have it  That you  You don't have to  Pay the ticket or no  Well  When he came up  And gave these to me  I turn around  And I said  I go  You're screwing with me  Aren't you  You're screwing with me  Sir  I go  First of all  These two 
[02:33:00]  Get thrown right out  And I go  And the lane change  I go  I'm just gonna say  That NYPD van  That was next to me  Changed lanes  And went into my lane  And I changed lanes  Under emergency  And  And didn't signal  But I was changing lanes  Because another vehicle  Was coming in on me  I go  You're screwing with me  Right  You're free to go sir  I go  Just say you're screwing with me  You're free to go  I'll stop the traffic  While you pull out sir  You fucking  Cocksucker

[02:34:00]  For a long time  When you said three tickets  I thought they might have got you  For fucking speeding  Or  Not that those are  But at least those aren't  Fucking major  Nah  That's bullshit  That's why I know  He was fucking with me  He was totally fucking with me  He made me wait there  Longer than it would have taken  To just write three tickets  And  And he wrote me up for like  Fucking  You know 
[02:34:30]  Come on  It's just annoying  Cause now you're either  Gonna have to hire a lawyer  Or spend a day  In traffic court  Or whatever  I'll just hire people  To fucking do my bidding  I'll hire people  To fucking  To do my will  And  And fucking go to court  Take care of this shit  Drag him in there though  He could face off  With my mouthpiece  That's what he's gonna do  It would be great  If your lawyer  Filed something wrong  And everything got mixed up  And you were sentenced  To four years in prison 
[02:35:00]  That would not be good  Jimmy  It wouldn't be good  But it would be amusing  Like ah  You silly  It would be funny  For everyone involved  Yeah  Well I took  A little picture  Of um  Of my  Escapade there  At the toll plaza  Which they'll probably  Get me on  Why are you taking  My picture  That's me  Looking backwards  At the fucking  Little walkway  That he  He walks between  As I was hoping  He would stumble  Could plow it over  Cocksucker

[02:39:30]  Yeah  It doesn't matter though  Because he fucking  He got me  That's just it  The little cat and mouse game  He fucking whacked me  Across the room  Yeah he did  If you were Al-Qaeda  Yeah  And  And he was the US  Right  He didn't get Bin Laden  Or Al-Zawahad  No  He just got  Fucking  He got like  A lieutenant  From Kenya  Ah  Okay  That's what that was  It was a fucking  A middle ranking  Al-Qaeda  Yeah  Lieutenant  Yeah

[02:43:30]  Bridge and tunnel  Guys  I don't  I don't see it  I just don't see it  It's  You know  First of all  You can't  Have a cop job  That doubles  As a toll taker  You know  Sometimes they're  Working you know  Law enforcement  Sometimes they're  Making change  While you're  Going through  The toll booth  Easy pass  Should have  Should have  Negated  Every single  Human being  At a toll  Plaza  Their job 
[02:44:00]  Could be taken care of  With easy passes  And cameras  Easy passes  And cameras  That's all you need  That's it  That's all you  Fucking need  But they're unions  I guess  You know  They uh  They keep them there  We could be saving  A lot of fucking money  In this city  Eliminate those  Fucking useless jobs  Yeah but they need  Someone in case  The gate doesn't go up  Yeah yeah  Well no gates  They got cameras  It takes a fucking  Picture  They send you a bill  Yeah but if there's  If there's a wild man 
[02:44:30]  Who keeps crossing  Through these tolls  Just on a mission  Of destruction  Oh yeah  There needs to be someone  Like our red headed friend  Who saved the day today  Are you saying  If there's a troublemaker  Coming through  Putting other motorists  In danger  Exactly  Reckless  Zipping back and forth  In between lanes  Like he owns the damn place  Yeah  There's not one  Fucking person out there  Who has not  Changed  Which  Which fucking  Little thing  You're going through  At the toll booth  I have  I have many times  Done that  But it's always 
[02:45:00]  Always with a signal change  It is not  A signal  Always  You gotta alert  Your fellow drivers  Absolutely  As to what you're about to do  Let the people behind me  Know what I'm doing  And let anybody  Looking in the rear view mirror  Know  I'm peeling off here folks  I even use the hand signal  Oh god no  Yeah 10 o'clock  2 o'clock  I'll do it smartly  No you don't  Hand right out there  And never without  Up to date registration  Never  I mean that's just  Irresponsible  For an insurance card  I check it before  I leave the garage  Every day  And I make sure  You have a driving checklist 
[02:45:30]  Yes I do  Check insurance  Reggie check  I'm reggie checking  I really can't stand  That part of it  Where it's just  The fucking insurance  Your proof of insurance  Nowadays  It just expires  Willy nilly  You would think by now  They would have like  An insurance card  With a scanner on it  And it'll either be valid  Or invalid  Exactly  Like they could check it  Instead of sending you  A new card  Every six months  And they send you the card  Like three months  Before you need it  So you just put it aside  You're like  Okay I'll put it in the car later 
[02:46:00]  And why the fuck  Are we dealing with  Handing paper  Out the window  In 2013  This should all be  Fucking digital  It should all be an app  It should all be an app  You should have your  Fucking insurance  Reggie  Everything on your phone  Eventually it'll be  On the scanner  Of the easy pass  And it will scan  All your stuff  And if you don't have  A registration or whatever  You'll also get a ticket  Immediately  Like it'll be one of those  Things where  They fucking get you  Every time  Every single time  Yeah  Motherfuckers

[02:47:00]  And open up those cones  Guys  Come on  We got a big  Exciting  Episode  Of BTO  Instead of starting  With a  Like a rape  Or a  Dead homeless guy  Right  That's how they  Started  Oh shit  It's a tractor trailer  Trying to go through  The midtown tunnel  He should have  Known better  Guys  Bobby  Bill  Get that fucking cone  Spin this guy around  All right 
[02:47:30]  He's turning  All right  That's it  Back to the toll booth  Yeah but there's always  A cliffhanger  Going into the first break  Yeah  Oh  The big machine  That opens up  The zipper lane  In the morning  Has stopped  I wonder why  Tune in next week  For another exciting episode  Of BTO  NCSI  With the guys ready  To turn around  And there's an ambulance  Coming through  Whisking a sick boy  Into the hospital  Oh man 
[02:48:00]  For emergency  Feet transplants  And two rookie  Fucking BTO guys  Go  What do we do  And the guy that  Wrote me the ticket  Goes I got this  I got it fellas  Don't you worry  This is where  Experience comes into play  I didn't even think about it  It was second nature  I stopped the big tractor trailer  And left the ambulance by  I'm saving lives  There's a man  Honking  Oh  Honking  Honking  Doesn't he see me  In front of the minivan 
[02:48:30]  No he doesn't  That's why I honked  You dope  And then he's just  Gonna dress me down  He looks like  One of these real  Frustrated fucks too  That he just has  Nothing to do  All day  Like that's exciting  Or fun  He's just gotta  Stand there  So if someone  Beeps their horn  He's gonna dress them down  His big fucking  Authority  He's gonna stand there  You can't honk  On my plaza  Blow me  He does have something  To do  Enforce 
[02:49:00]  The rules of the road  That's right  He's our representative  Not even the road  The rules of the plaza  Imagine if someone  With a small child  In the car  Had been going in there  And not seeing that  That unsignaled lane change  There could have been carnage  God forbid  I looked  And there was  No one there  What if I was behind you  And I was  What  With my daughter  Right  And you're like  Oh it's safe  Nobody's signaling  To come over  No one's coming over here  No  There was nobody 
[02:49:30]  Squish  Near the lane  There was an NYPD van  To my right  And we both came up  At about the same speed  The NYPD van  I was flanking his rear  Fucking quarter panel there  And uh  And uh  He moved  He went to move over  One lane  To get into his little  Toll thing there  And I moved over  At the same time  It was like  Synchronized swimming  After signaling  He moved over  No he didn't signal either  By the way  By the by  And uh 
[02:50:00]  And I moved over  And if I hadn't  Moved over  That NYPD van  Would have uh  Would have clipped  My front end  So I changed lanes  To  To save everybody  At the plaza  See this is  The second half  This is the second half  Of the ultra exciting  Law and order BTO  Where we get to the court  Yes yes  And a jury of your peers  Decides whether or not  You were really  The jury of my peers  Yes  Besides whether or not 
[02:50:30]  You were really  Forced into that lane  Oh imagine the drama  Me  And fucking  The Eastside Dave cop  Fucking  Ginger fuck  They're in court  That'll be exciting  Face to face  Once again  Just like we were  Out there  On the plaza  But you know what  Now he doesn't have  All the fucking  Authority  And he's not holding  All the cards  Because it's the  Judicial system  Of America  And we are  Fucking presumed  Innocent 
[02:51:00]  Mariska Hargitay  Would be there too  Oh yeah  It's law and order  Yeah  It's law and order  And you're holding  Your registration  And insurance card  And insurance card  And I look at him  And it's like that scene  At a fucking  Dirty Harry or something  Where the judge  Has to fucking  Acquit the guy  Because of  Some fucking  Glitch  And then he ends up  In the elevator  With Harry  Callahan  And he smiles  At him  Yeah  I fucking  Got off 
[02:51:30]  Bitch  Yeah  I got my  Insurance card  Right here  Yeah  You see me  Fucking finesse  That judge  About that lane  Change  Huh  And he'll be like  Damn it  And he goes back  To the fucking  Toll plaza  You know we try  To enforce the rules here  And the fucking  Court system  Just lets these  Criminals go  Gets real pissed  Fires fucking  Six rounds  Into my engine block  As I'm  Driving through  The toll booth  Next time  Gets arrested  Put into a fucking 
[02:52:00]  Loony asylum  Fucker  Embarrassing  Just getting abused  And not taken seriously  I mean you could be  Replaced by either  An electronic fucking  Thing on your windshield  Or a basket  That fucking  Change basket  On the side of a  Fucking door  You're a piece  Of shit  If you ask me  Yeah what if we  Just install ticket  Machines instead  That's it right  How about a punch  Card  A punch card  For a ticket  Machine  Yeah  Why not  Yeah  I just  I don't know 
[02:52:30]  I don't  You know  You see NYPD guys  Every so often  They gotta direct traffic  And they just look  Miserable doing it  But  But  You know  If something happens  While they're directing traffic  They'll jump right in  Right  This sounds like an example  Of do as I say  Not do as I do  Oh yeah  Certainly does  Sounds like someone  Thinks he's above the law  Yeah  And I mean  You talk about this  Officer not signaling  Yeah  I think today you learned  Two wrongs  Do not make a right  Well 
[02:53:00]  Three rights make a left  According to Judy  That's correct  I know that much  Well you tell that  To the officer  The next time  You're being given  A summons  For inappropriate signaling  He  Yeah  He was just being  A prick  Because  I fucking  You know  I didn't respect  His authority  When we last met  And obviously  At this time  He didn't respect  His authority  Enough to put  A nice new  Registration sticker  On your windshield  Oh I'm gonna put it on

[03:04:00]  Yeah and you had a huge podcast  I had a big podcast  It was  The guests you used to get  Were unbelievable  Yeah  You got Carlin  You got Carlin  Larry King  All sorts of people  Paul Giovanni  Paul Giamatti  Chris Rock  Kid Rock  Giamatti  That too  Giamatti  This was way before podcasts  Were  I had the first one  Yeah  Oh you didn't  I had the first podcast  I had the first podcast  Interviewing comedians  I did  I had the first podcast  Fight  Fight  With comedians 
[03:04:30]  Fight  Alright I don't know  Me and Carlin Quinn  Me and sometimes Carlin Quinn  Was the first podcast  With comedians  I think I was doing it  Before you and Carlin Quinn  I don't think so  I think I was  I don't think you were  I think I was  I don't think you were  And it's my show  So that's it  Don't say anything more  I will kick you off the show  I'm almost positive  When are they going to  Fight in the mud  Was that a fucking pig joke  No that was a girls in bikinis joke  Oh  Oh look who's here  Here he is  Oh shit 
[03:05:00]  Oh shit  Real as  Dude  He bought it  By the way  You know  That shirt he's wearing  Is a Boston Red Sox shirt  Yeah I know  It's from me  Dickhead  Oh it is  Yeah I gave it to him  I had no idea  He had no idea  I didn't fit into it anymore  So I gave it to him  It's a great shirt right  No it's not  Why isn't it a great shirt  There's way better  Boston Red Sox shirts  That looks like an affliction shirt  Yeah but that's what's cool about it  No that's not what's cool 
[03:05:30]  Yeah it is  That's what  That's what's not cool  I'll tell you what's cool  What's cool about it  Is that asshole  Gets to wear a Red Sox shirt now  Yeah  Yeah he can't wear  Just a regular Red Sox shirt  He looks like he mugged  A Red Sox fan  If he had a regular  Red Sox shirt on  Honestly Red Sox could be hockey  I don't even know  What the fuck you're talking about  I don't watch those gay ass sports  Greer this is what we have to deal with  Greer what's up baby  What's up man  NW you up son  We got Greer Barnes  The Greer Barnes  One of the funniest guys  Unbelievable 
[03:06:00]  Walking the planet right now  I've heard that  I don't know how much I buy into that shit  But I've heard it  Fucking hilarious  It's unbelievable  We have Kelly Festuca  One of the least funny persons  Whatever Greer is to comedy  She is the opposite  The opposite to comedy  Yeah  She is  That is what they call the spectrum  My friends  It's the only time I'm going to be in the same sentence as Greer  You're either going to be here or here  Or in between 
[03:06:30]  I'm glad I keep the comical world in balance  And she was on comical radio too  She used to do a show with Iacono  Wait what  What past life did you live  You had your own show  No I was a guest on his show  I was good friends with Chris back in the day  I thought you were a co-host on his show  Weren't you for the grandma's basement  Oh no I was on it a few times  But I wasn't co-host  I think Warren was  That just shows how little I paid attention to Chris's show  That's just mean  I brought you all here today 
[03:07:00]  First of all  I'm very excited that Greer came on  And this is so funny  Because there's certain people that I kind of  I don't really bother  I don't really you know  I don't really  Hey you know  I got you guys  And certain people  Hey can I come on  But Greer walked by me  And said hey  When can I do your podcast  And I was like  Fuck whatever you want  Asshole  What are you  What are you an open mic-er  I've known you  My whole fucking New York comedy career  Just say I'm coming on  Asshole  That's just it 
[03:07:30]  I don't want to  I mean I don't mean that  Yeah I don't mean that  Like I don't do that next week  Because you can't  Because it's already booked  No I already know what floor it's on  Guys Greer is on every episode  Greer won't stop coming  And just like  I can't follow  He's murdered  Just like the seller  I can't follow this guy  I really  Let me tell you something  You gotta go up after  Fucking Greer  It's  I'll tell you  Before you tell  What I was gonna tell  No I just  I just was gonna say it's  I just like saying it's  It's  It's my new sketch 
[03:08:00]  I caught you  You fucking cocksucker  Yeah you did  I caught you  Pulling a fucking Godfrey  No no shit  No  It's like  Shut the fuck up  You're a fucking  Thought stealer  Man when he's on stage  This is what sucks about you Greer  What's that  Is you kill effortlessly  You bring him up  And you bring him down  And you fucking just  Back and forth  Like a badminton game  Like I gotta go up sometimes 
[03:08:30]  And you motherfuckers  Are coming with me  Come on motherfuckers  Greer goes what's up  And it's like  What the  And then he just  Kills him  And then he just goes  Yeah  It takes a sip  He really does kill  Like that neck crack  Like  And just lowers him down  That's how he murders  Well that's the thing about Greer  It's like  If he doesn't kill  It's because he decided  To let you go  You know  It's like a fucking  He decided to let you live  It really is  Checking the lineup  Every night  You're like  Yeah  Fuck I gotta follow Greer  Yeah  Like in the back hall 
[03:09:00]  You can do this  You can do this  Yeah Greer's a motherfucker  To follow  But I also like following him  Because he gets the crowd  Into this  This storytelling mode  Which is great  Yes  You know  When it's  Joke joke joke joke joke joke joke  And then I go up  And I'm like  Hey I like to say  Hi  Yeah  I just go up and go  So I was  Yeah  Walking down the street  In New York  New York's funny  I don't do that shit  Kelly gets him  Into a storytelling mode  But the story is  That girl really sucked  At comedy  Oh  Fire in the first shot 
[03:09:30]  I was at  I was at  The taping of Greer's  Comedy Central special  And it's to this day  Probably one of the greatest  Live stand up shows  I've ever seen  That's not true  But the thing is  Richard Pryor  I didn't see that live  Eddie Murphy Raw  Listen to me  I'm talking about live shows  Well be more specific  I said live  The one you saw  The one you saw  You've been awful hostile  Since I moved to LA  You're mad at me  I am mad at you  I know  I am mad at you  For moving to LA  Because you shouldn't
