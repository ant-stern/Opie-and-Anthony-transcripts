<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts engaging in nonsensical banter before outlining the day's schedule, which includes appearances by Rodney Dangerfield and Louis Black, and continuing coverage of their “Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.”  Several callers phone in; Jay claims to have worn a WOW shirt on TRL, though lacks proof; Steve criticizes the previous day's show; John corroborates Jay’s claim; and Pat comments on Anthony’s balloon-blowing ineptitude.  A show staffer, Mike, mentions upcoming segments featuring a mime and a racist joke.

A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to a caller, Paul, fixated on the potential of contracting a disease from Rodney Dangerfield’s sweat-soaked towel.  The hosts relentlessly mock Paul’s anxieties, speculating about Dangerfield’s age and health, and even implicating Paul’s father in his paranoia.  Paul is eventually invited to the studio to meet Dangerfield.

The discussion shifts to Eddie Van Halen's cancer diagnosis and its potential impact on a band reunion, prompting crude jokes from callers Andy regarding his tongue cancer and roadies.  Another caller reports hearing Louis Black in a cookie commercial.  The conversation returns to the whipped cream bikini contest and the contestants’ physical attributes.

A segment details Twinkles, a cat who survived being tumble-dried, featuring an interview with her owner, Rachel Wallace.  The hosts’ interview with Rachel is highly sexually suggestive and vulgar, focusing on the cat’s injuries and Rachel’s perceived irresponsibility.  Rachel describes the incident and her actions, providing her email address for donations to Twinkles' medical fund. The segment concludes with a naked woman entering the studio, showcasing her tattoos and briefly interacting with the hosts.

A subsequent segment features B-movie actress Darian as a guest.  The hosts discuss her lesbian-themed films, encouraging her to perform a “B-movie scream” and laugh. They suggest wrapping her in toilet paper after she dons a whipped cream bikini. A call from JJ, a bar owner, details a sexual encounter with his wife, prompting discussion about his bar's clientele.  Advertisements for Woodbridge Power Sports and ProFlowers.com air.  Engineer Pete is repeatedly referenced, often concerning his reactions to the female guests.  Further discussion of Darian’s films ("Erotic Witch Project," "I See Dead Strippers") ensues, along with a call from director Terry West and a failed attempt to use a cell phone to elicit a reaction from a staff member.  The entire segment is rife with sexually suggestive comments.

Another segment begins with a caller recounting a difficult relationship with his verbally abusive, eccentric grandmother, detailing a lawsuit she filed and expressing no remorse for their estrangement.  This sparks discussion about family dynamics and inheritance disputes involving elderly relatives.  The segment transitions back to Darian, now in a cutout mummy costume.  The hosts, staff, and Rodney Dangerfield, now also a guest, engage in sexually suggestive banter, photograph Darian, and discuss Darian's appearance, Rodney's career, and marijuana use.  A call-in segment gives away tickets to see Dangerfield perform.  The discussion continues to involve frequent references to sexual acts and body parts, along with implied marijuana consumption. The segment ends with discussion of Dangerfield's departure and promotional plugs.

A final segment features discussions of a female contestant's increasingly outrageous behavior on a CBS morning show, a caller discussing a marijuana legalization march, and a caller criticizing the “Whipped Cream Bikini Contest” entrants, sparking debate about the contestants’ attractiveness and leading to another unexpected in-studio appearance by a naked woman.  Comedian Lewis Black arrives, engaging in humorous interactions with the naked woman (sitting on his lap), and discusses his films (including "I See Dead Strippers") and his health.  Rodney Dangerfield’s appearance is mentioned again, along with anecdotes and the caller with his sweat-soaked towel.  A contest to win a trip to Los Angeles to see the *Survivor* finale concludes the segment, with a caller winning by answering a question about a morning show boomerang incident.  Sponsor mentions for ProFlowers.com and Planet Java are also included. The show ends with a comedian recounting their early, "horrible" stand-up career, culminating in eventual success and awards.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Eight minutes of pure adrenaline. It's Ben.  W. Ben E. W. now concludes its broadcast day.  Stay tuned for W. O. N. A. on 1027 W. N. E. W.  Insect. Who's that hot? Insect. Who's that? Insect. Insect. Hold on.  I'm dirty. I'm dirty. I'm dirty. Can you give me a bath?  Oh, boy. I think I want to be a hooker when I grow up. 
[00:00:30]  Okay. Terrific. Hey, stop it. Can I see your stuff? Can I see your stuff?  This doesn't taste like banana juice. Can you get me drunk again?  Daddy, I don't like it. Daddy, my poopy hurts.  That's a tampon. Oh, no. What's the leather cheerio?  Dirty, dirty, dirty little fank. Grandpa, you're so much bigger than daddy.  What's that popcorn? If I shake a bottle, will it pop?  Oh, yeah. I'm drunk now, so it won't hurt.  Shall we go, Dave? 
[00:01:00]  Daddy, look what I did to you again.  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  1827 W. N. E. W.  It's the O. N. H. Joe.  Good afternoon.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  All right.  Well, we're here for another day of crappy radio.  Oh, I'm hoping for fun and hijink. 
[00:01:30]  Now, we got lots going on today.  Rodney Datingfield coming in at 4, 5.  Where's he playing? Around here again?  That guy should sleep.  Like, why is he still...  I mean, I appreciate it.  Thank you, Rodney.  It's great that he's out doing shows, but...  I think he's made enough.  Maybe he should relax a little.  You don't have to ask him about that.  Why are you still... 
[00:02:00]  It's out there in the clubs.  Oh, he'll be in at 5.  Blue is black at 6 o'clock.  Good.  I'll sort of shake his cage up a little bit.  Mr. Socialist.  Yeah.  And more girls coming down for the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  We only had one yesterday.  Yeah, we had one girl hoping for more girls today.  There's some favorites already.  You could tell.  Reading instant feedback and emails.  Some favorites out there.  But don't be discouraged, girls. 
[00:02:30]  Now, a lot of people think Kimmy is in the running.  That is not true.  No.  They think it's rigged with Kimmy.  So, ladies, come on down.  We got the trip to Hawaii.  Courtesy of Contiki Tours.  And we'll be qualifying you ladies all this week of the voting.  We'll start next week, all right?  Trip to Hawaii.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Yo, I was on TRO yesterday.  I had the WOW shirt.  No one saw you.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yo, a friend of mine said...  What color was your shirt?  Green? 
[00:03:00]  It was wine green.  Yeah, I got a couple of emails on that.  And no one saw you.  Are you serious?  Yeah, because it was your friend's writing to say that you were on.  Yeah.  Yeah, a friend of mine called in yesterday.  Jay, let me tell you something.  When someone puts an O&A sign on TV or a WOW sign on TV, I mean, our phones explode, the  email explodes, our personal voicemail explodes.  Yeah?  Nothing.  You got nothing.  Are you kidding me?  Nothing.  They probably avoided you.  And we got a couple of emails, and I think one was from you, and one was your friend saying, 
[00:03:30]  dude, my friend was on TRL with the WOW shirt.  Did you see him?  A different one of my friends saw it on TV.  I was trying to get a tape of it and double-checking and whatnot.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  No one can confirm you did it, so I don't know what to tell you.  I mean, we'd love to take care of you.  Yeah.  Some guy working there was yelling at me.  He was like, oh, what does WOW mean?  Right.  And I had to make up some crap so they didn't kick me out.  Right.  What was the band on last night?  What?  What band was playing?  Outkast. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  During their second performance, the camera was right up on me.  That's Outkast with a K, right?  Yeah.  Outkast with a K.  All right, Jay.  I don't know what to tell you.  Maybe someone could call in and say they saw you or something.  All right.  But we can't confirm it.  All right.  All right?  I can try and confirm it for you.  I can bring a tape down on Thursday if I can get one.  Well, that would be cool.  Yeah.  That would confirm it, right?  Yeah.  I hope that would.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks, Jay.  See you later, guys.  Bye.  They probably avoid you.  Yeah, probably.  You've got to sneak it on. 
[00:04:30]  It's a bunch of tools.  Yeah.  But it wasn't.  All right.  Jay's done.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  You have Louis Black today at 6 and Rodney at 4 or 5?  Yeah, Rodney at 5 o'clock.  Okay.  So that leaves you from now to 5 o'clock not to screw up like yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see what we can do today.  Hopefully, you'll be more funny.  More funny than yesterday?  Be more funny.  Be more funny.  Yesterday was quite funny.  Yeah.  Did you listen to all four hours?  Of course.  So it must have been pretty good, right? 
[00:05:00]  Well, I was hoping it was going to get better.  So you sat there for four hours listening, hoping we were going to get better?  Well, hey, listen.  I'm a faithful fan.  Well, we appreciate that.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, man.  When Balloon Guy came in, I felt good when we first came in yesterday.  And then, I don't know, when Balloon Guy came in, I'm not blaming Balloon Guy, but his  energy level was a little low.  And I don't think the balloon things translate well to a radio. 
[00:05:30]  Although Rick got pictures, so if you want to see them, do those make the website, Rick?  Yeah, I can't put them on.  Where are they?  On NAW.com?  Huh?  I haven't seen them yet, but I think they're on NAW.com.  Wow.  So you could actually see the pictures of what he was doing yesterday.  And Balloon Guy in the country.  Fantastic.  Mike, what's going on?  Who's going to be your balloon artist guest of the day?  Well, we have a mime scheduled for 3.30 today.  He's going to walk into the wind, so I'm looking forward to that.  And then he's going to make like he's behind, he's in a glass cube and trying to get out. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, Ant.  Huh?  What do you call a Martian at McDonald's?  What?  McNigger.  Oh, nice.  Thank you, Mike.  You're welcome.  Nice.  There's Balloon Guy with all his balloon things.  Oh, there it is, yeah, with the mermaid and the biker guy.  It was fascinating.  John, what's up?  Yeah, guys, I can confirm that well on MTV, man.  My sister watches every day for it.  Yeah?  She called me all day at work like, yeah, man, I see you. 
[00:06:30]  There's a green T-shirt.  And she said it was pretty clear a couple times.  You're not friends with Jay?  No, not at all.  Yeah.  I don't even, I mean, I live down in South Jersey, so if he lives in South Jersey, maybe  I might know him, but yeah, I can confirm.  Jay, if you're still listening, call back.  We'll give you something.  I know you were trying to get it on.  Take care, guys.  All right, man.  Pat, what's going on?  Yo, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I want to know, yesterday's show, where you have to listen for, yesterday's show,  was when Anthony was trying to blow those balloons up in the background. 
[00:07:00]  He's trying to blow into these balloons, making all these noises.  He's out of breath.  You have to replay that.  Listen to this, Anthony, trying to blow up those balloons.  It was during the whole show, and I couldn't blow it up.  I think he gave me a trick balloon.  You were, you could see, you're out of breath.  I'm trying to try to talk.  You're cursing at him.  He gave me a trick balloon, I think.  It made it hurt in the corners of your mouth, and you try to blow it up.  And he's like, oh, you're stretching it and do that.  Get out of here.  No, they're impossible to blow up.  They're real thin.  But, hey, guys, I'll listen to myself on the radio later. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Paul, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Who's this?  Oh, and hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Anthony, how you doing?  Hey.  Listen, Sunday night, I went to see Rodney over in Newark.  And after the performance, I ended up getting the towel that he wiped his sweat with.  And I'll do anything.  I tried to go up to the stage for some reason.  He wouldn't shake anybody's hand, and he wouldn't.  Oh, wait.  You emailed me, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You think Rodney has some kind of disease, right? 
[00:08:00]  I don't think he has some disease.  No, no, no.  In the email, you said you wanted to know if Rodney had some kind of disease because he  wouldn't shake anyone's hand.  So you're wondering if he had something on his hand.  And then you have, like, a sweaty towel.  So then you thought after you got home, oh, my God, I got his sweaty towel, and I've been  holding it all night.  I'm going to get what Rodney has.  That's pretty much what you said in your email, right?  Yeah, a little bit.  Not just, you know, just the godfather of comedy, though.  Yeah.  But, you know, I love him.  And, you know, I know he was there with you the other day. 
[00:08:30]  And I was just, you know, wondering if he was, you know, shaking hands and taking pictures.  I was over at the comedy cellar last night.  Paul, Paul, you can't be serious.  You really think Rodney has some kind of disease and you're paranoid about it?  I don't know if he has a disease.  But you wanted to know when he was shaking hands, right?  Yeah, I wanted to know if he was, like, shaking hands and stuff.  Yeah, I was curious why he wouldn't shake anybody's hand.  Maybe he doesn't want stink palm.  Are you trying to give him stink palm?  I did wipe my butt a little bit before I went to shake his hand.  Paul, he's older and he's a little fragile. 
[00:09:00]  Maybe he doesn't want to, like, shake hands.  Hey, I'm not trying to, you know, diss the guy.  I love him to death.  You don't have any diseases from Rodney Dangerfield, okay?  Okay.  Because I know, I read your email and I thought you were a wacko.  Really?  And now, I didn't, I wasn't even going to read your email on the air.  Now you call, so now you put me in a position.  I got to talk to you about it.  No, I'm sorry, Opie.  Listen, I love you guys.  I didn't mean to cause any trouble.  I met you Sunday night over at, uh...  No, you didn't cause any trouble, but your email was a little disturbing. 
[00:09:30]  You think you're getting, like, a disease from Rodney Dangerfield if you shake his hand.  That's a little weird.  I didn't think.  I was just curious.  Why would you be curious about something like that?  Well, I don't know why, you know, why actually somebody else...  Are you one of those guys afraid of germs and stuff?  Listen, not at all.  I do have an anxiety problem a little bit, but that's not the thing.  I'm an aspiring comedian.  I love the guy so much.  I have his towel, and, you know, with the germ thing, I don't do anything to have him sign  now.  All right, where's the towel right now?  Right now, it's in my drawer. 
[00:10:00]  But you're scared of it, aren't you?  In a plastic bag.  In a plastic bag.  Are you a little worried about the towel?  Not anymore.  Not at all.  It was just one of them things.  All right, but I'm kind of curious.  Before you called the show, were you worried about the towel still?  No.  You're such a liar.  Do you want me to dig up your email?  I honestly thought someone was just pulling my leg.  No, I wasn't.  And now you confirm that you are a wacko by calling the show with the same thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What kind of disease do you think you could get from Rodney Dangerfield's towel?  I have no idea. 
[00:10:30]  And why didn't you throw it away?  He was on the air the other day, and you were asking him about his health, and he said  that he wasn't doing so well.  So that's what got me curious.  I'm not a wacko that just thinks people have diseases, you know?  He's doing okay.  I think he was born in 1920.  I think he looks it up.  Yeah.  The other night, he was in great shape.  He came out.  He did a whole hour, hour and a half set, and it was great.  The only problem, you just couldn't hear him a little bit.  And he did great.  The only thing was, I was just curious why he wouldn't shake anybody's hand.  And I had his towel, and he's coming in today. 
[00:11:00]  And, I mean, I would do anything to have him sign that, or just to talk to him.  Paul, where are you right now?  Right now, I'm in Garfield, New Jersey.  If you could get here by 6.  Yes, I want to see this guy shake Rodney's hand now.  Oh, that would be good.  I'd do anything.  I can't confirm that he doesn't have anything, though.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm just kidding.  Hello?  Yeah, bring the Rodney towel down.  Bring it down?  Yeah, are you going to put it in a plastic bag? 
[00:11:30]  I'll, I'll, I'll, what do you, whatever you want me to do, Opie, Anthony, and I'll do it.  If you thought he had a disease, why did you keep the towel?  No, when I got the towel, I was just curious.  My father put it in my head.  I don't think he has a disease.  All right, wait, what did your dad say?  I got the towel, and he said, my father said, Paul, why did, you know, what are you going to do with the towel, you know, with the sweat?  He's like, he's like, he's old, he probably has a disease.  And I was like, well, I was like, he's the godfather of comedy.  I'm like, when Elvis Presley, he's like the Elvis of comedy.  When Elvis Presley would throw those things with his, you know, with his stupid cape and everything, you know, girls would go crazy over it. 
[00:12:00]  And, you know, it's a souvenir, you know, and I wanted to keep it.  I understand the whole souvenir thing, but you think you're going to get a disease from Rodney.  I don't think that anymore.  I was curious that night.  Before we hang up, because this is getting a little long-winded, what kind of disease did you think in the back of your head you were going to get from touching Rodney?  Honestly, I have no idea.  Come on, tell me.  Come on, you had to have a chance.  I don't know names of diseases. 
[00:12:30]  Something osis?  Something osis, Rodney osis.  Where your skin was going to fall off or something?  I don't know, where I was going to get no respect or something.  I don't know.  All right, Paul.  Can I please come down and shake his hand, do something, have him sign it, and also have you guys sign my comedy book?  It would really mean a lot to me.  Yeah, no problem.  But we're going to make Rodney cough on you if you come down.  Okay.  All right.  Can I come down there?  Yeah.  What do I say?  You don't have to say anything.  How do they know it's me?  Well, no, Paul.  All right, so where's the building? 
[00:13:00]  All right, hold on.  Someone will give you directions, all right?  All right, thank you very much.  Take care, Paul.  All right.  We ain't fighting this freaking wacko here.  Why not?  He's got to shake Rodney's hand.  His email was really funny, but I thought someone just pulled my leg, but now I'm talking to the guy.  It's obvious he's got a little screw loose.  Yeah.  Did you catch that he said that he started to say he met you Sunday night, Opie, and he was at Newark on Sunday night, too, to see Rodney.  So he saw Rodney.  Paul.  Yeah.  You met me as well Sunday?  No, I met you.  I forgot.  I met you Friday night at the Jim Brewer show. 
[00:13:30]  You were coming up the stairs, and I said, Opie.  He said, yeah.  No, you're right.  You said that in your email.  Okay.  Cool.  All right.  We're just checking.  And you were very nice.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  All right.  This guy's a fruit, man.  He's crazy.  Mac, what's going on?  Yeah, I figured it out.  Between Lewis, who we all know is constantly on the verge of a heart attack, and Rodney Dangerfield, it's got to be about 90.  You guys are actually trying to have a death occur on the radio today.  On air?  Pushing the limits once again, on air. 
[00:14:00]  Now, we had that death yesterday, if you were listening.  I missed it.  What happened?  Just a fun-filled show for everybody.  All right.  The show.  Now, Rodney could drop dead at any moment, though.  That is true.  I'm listening.  He told us himself.  He did say that.  He said he's got like an aorta thing that could explode at any time.  And he was kind of joking about it, which was kind of...  And did you see when Mendy sat on his lap?  What is she, insane?  The guy could snap a hip sneezing.  And she's sitting on his lap. 
[00:14:30]  That's like 300 pounds.  Yeah, there's the picture.  See, everyone would think that's Rodney doing his famous pose with his eyes, you know, bulging out of his head.  No, that's because Mendy's all over him.  350 pounds of pressure.  That's not the shot of her sitting on his lap, though.  Doesn't he look like the Wax Museum, Rodney?  He does.  Jumbo.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Listen, I have it on good authority.  Rodney's got cornucopia.  That's according to Judge Jr.  A 24-hour recall. 
[00:15:00]  See, we had good stuff yesterday.  Cornucopia.  You just got to know where to find them, guys.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  They had to kind of weed through it.  The cool thing is, you know, because Eddie has the cancer and stuff, it's going to bring Van Halen back together with David Lee Roth.  It looked like David Lee Roth was just using this as an excuse to try to get back in the band.  Like, first, he's like, oh, yeah, I support, you know, Eddie and hope he gets well.  And I'll be there for the reunion concert.  I don't think Eddie's worrying about getting a David Lee Roth version of Van Halen together. 
[00:15:30]  Cancer brings people together.  He's worried about his tongue falling out.  Oh, tongue cancer.  Ouch.  Oh.  Andy, what's going on?  What's happening?  Sorry to hear about Eddie's tongue.  I guess we've paid for all those roadies in the past.  Well, what?  All right, I'm trying to figure it out.  All right.  All right, listen.  Wait, Andy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Now you got to explain the joke.  Well, you know, obviously the man wasn't a priest on the road when he was younger, no? 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  How do you wait?  Well, probably more from smoking than eating at the Y.  No, it wasn't from bad you-know-what.  It was like chewing tobacco and stuff.  There you go.  I don't think no matter how bad the ahu-ha is, I don't think it gives you tongue cancer.  All right, maybe it doesn't.  Not only that, roadies are usually men, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, groupies, maybe.  Sorry, meant to say groupies.  Wow.  You really screwed that up.  So you think he got the tongue cancer from putting his tongue in bad places?  Well, you know, one never knows. 
[00:16:30]  I think that was worse than my white shorts joke right there after explaining it.  No?  Listen, I'm on vacation.  I'm watching TV.  I'm watching some CBS affiliate out of Tennessee, and they're running a commercial for some kind  of cookies.  Like, you know, chocolate chip cookies, Mrs. Brown's cookies or something crazy like that.  Yeah?  Who's doing the voiceover on the commercial?  A very compelling voice.  I'd certainly want to buy a product from.  Would that be Louis Black?  Louis Black.  Doing a cookie commercial.  I'm telling you, you could hear in his voice, he was trying to maintain his composure. 
[00:17:00]  All right, write that down.  We've got to ask Louis Black about his cookie commercial.  Unbelievable.  And he's trying to be cool, calm, and collected, and I'm going, that's Lou Black.  Right.  Unbelievable.  All right, man.  Love you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Tammy, you're next on WNEW.  That guy is an idiot.  What disease can you get through touching someone's sweat?  The guy is dead serious.  He's downplaying it now that we got him on the air.  His email was pretty intense.  He was, like, really paranoid.  He wanted me to call him back to make sure Rodney had nothing. 
[00:17:30]  Can't you get malaria through sweat?  Malaria?  I don't think Rodney has malaria.  It was in the jungle.  Even if, like, God said, it'd say he had, like, HIV.  Like, you can't get through sweat.  Like, this kid's so ignorant.  If you're dead-ass cancer, Tony.  And maybe Rodney just has that obsessive compulsiveness where he doesn't want to touch people.  I can't blame him.  Maybe he's old, and if you shake his hand, it's going to crumble.  Maybe he just doesn't know what people are putting their hands.  He's like a mummy.  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to talk. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, what happened to my hand?  If you're lucky to be 81, I don't think you're going to want to walk around having, like,  hundreds of people shake your hand.  No, I wouldn't want that.  Hey, come back with my pinky.  All right.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  Now, this guy's going to claim that eating at the Y, chlamydia can give you tongue cancer.  Jim.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's completely possible.  My mother is a GYN.  Get a doctor on the phone.  His mother is a GYN.  If she has chlamydia, she has a TG repairman.  So the girl has the chlamydia.  Right, and you go down and eating at the Y, right? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And you get the warts in your throat, which causes the cancer.  And it has to be actually pinched right out of the...  Oh, my God.  It's disgusting.  I've seen a video on it.  It's like alligator clips.  They go in there, and they rip the wart right off.  I mean, it's disgusting.  All right.  We're going to get a doctor on the phone.  Dude, believe me when I tell you.  You can't get any cancer from eating at the Y.  Yes, sir.  No way.  I would not kid you on this.  Well, we have doctors that listen to this show.  All right.  So listen.  I'm going to go listen to myself on the radio.  Get a doctor.  All right.  Girls coming down for the whipped cream bikini contest?  I sure as hell hope so. 
[00:19:00]  Had a few emails from girls that are saying they're coming down today.  Ladies, you're crazy.  I mean, we are getting a lot of emails going,  man, you know, there's no real contenders in this contest.  Well, we're talking about a trip to Hawaii.  Yeah, come down.  Give it a shot.  Courtesy of Contiki Tours.  Also want to thank whippedcreambikini.com for helping us out with this little contest.  Yes.  And Victory Limousine.  But ladies, get down here either today, tomorrow, Thursday, or Friday between 3 and 7.  Get your pictures taken in the whipped cream bikini.  You have fun. 
[00:19:30]  You come in.  Maybe if you have an interesting little story, like that one, what was her name?  Cakes?  Cakes.  About the balloon knot?  She called yesterday, completely hammered, and we didn't get to her.  Ah, probably gold right there.  That was gold yesterday.  Jesus.  All right.  All right, Rick.  We'll get to the Cat in the Dryer story next.  Rick has been obsessing about this story.  We'll do that.  And I don't want them dumping out down the hall.

[00:20:00]  was quoted in the paper today.  And everyone is talking about this.

[00:22:30]  It's the O.N.A. show.  All right, we got a doctor on the line before we move on.  Lou the doctor, what's going on?  Lou?  Lou, what's going on?  This is Dr. Peters.  Dr. Peters?  Yes.  Yeah.  That would be Dr. Peters from Caddyshack?  No, that would be Peepers, I know.  Well, listen, there have been studied cases that do make some forms of cancer.  Lou.  Lou.  Ratio?  Lou. 
[00:23:00]  Excuse me?  Where do you go to school?  When do I go to school?  Yeah.  Listen, I have a good idea for tomorrow's show.  I want to come on and do my juggling app.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, man, we're moving on from yesterday's show, and it wasn't even that bad, so shut up.  Okay, have a good day.  All right, man.  I really...  Ah, the chick hung up there and had the whole phobia thing.  Damn.  Ah.  All right.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, check out the WNEW website this morning.  Went to the ONA Kini contest.  Definitely his favorite. 
[00:23:30]  You have favorites?  Yeah, Kelly.  Kelly and Jesse.  Very good.  What about...  Kelly's the blonde.  Yep.  Jesse the brunette.  Kelly was just phenomenal.  I mean, she was...  Unbelievable.  She was unbelievable when she walked in.  And I had to go back and forth.  My wife was upstairs getting ready for work.  I had my bathrobe on.  Uh-huh.  She was ready to go to school, and I whipped up a batch to Jesse.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks, guys.  That's great stuff.  Well, at least you're being honest.  What about Dallas?  Or I think her name is Cecilia.  Ah, they're all good. 
[00:24:00]  Some of them are pretty big, like Stalker Patty and that other big fat one.  Well, yeah.  I mean, there's some messes in there.  We could all be honest.  Dallas is too stripper-like.  Who?  Kimmy's got a big mouth.  Yeah.  Dallas has a really nice body, though.  God.  Well, no, I'm just saying, if you're not into the stripper-type chicks.  Well, then you've got Celia.  Yeah.  Was that Dallas, the one with the big...  Cowboy hat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, the cowboy hat girl was real nice.  You're right.  All right.  So I think we have... 
[00:24:30]  And Madison was pretty hot.  Yeah, you're right.  Always a favorite.  I would say there's, like, at least six finalists in there.  We need, like, four more finalists.  You know what I'm probably going to do tomorrow?  And I don't think we're going to get...  I'm probably going to take a second look.  All right.  I don't think we're going to get it from this batch that is on www.com.  So...  Yes, Rick?  We've got our first girl.  She's in right now, filling out paperwork.  Ah.  Can they hear us out there?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, she's hot.  Okay.  No, she's not a big hope. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  We'll have more pictures up on www.com soon.  www.com.  All right.  It is awkward when you start talking about the girls when they're out there because they  could hear us.  And sometimes when there's one that maybe might not be a finalist, just by a hair, it's  kind of awkward when you talk about them in here.  Now we've got to see her.  When did she come in?  She's got to fill out paperwork?  Fill out paperwork, yeah, ma'am.  All right.  Well, then we can get to this Haywood thing.  Now, what writer fell for that gag? 
[00:25:30]  Well, it's the Post.  It is the Post, right?  Yeah.  Neil Graves.  What a tool.  Probably the number one fake name.  Yeah.  Right?  I think Michael Hunt.  Michael Hunt is up there.  I can't even think of others.  Like, well, Philip McCracken.  I was going to say Phil McCracken.  Phil McCracken.  What are some of the Jerky Boys ones?  I can't remember now.  Who falls for Haywood, though?  I mean, do you know anyone named Haywood? 
[00:26:00]  No.  No.  You're right.  They did an article on these coffee cafe banks, they're calling them.  Basically, you know, we've seen the internet cafes where you go and you have a cup of coffee  and you surf a little bit, blah, blah, blah.  Now they're taking it to the next level and they're like bank cafes, I guess they call them.  So you get your coffee and you can do online investing and things like that.  Check your stocks.  Get some advice on, you know, where you should put your money and stuff. 
[00:26:30]  And these places are popping up all over Manhattan.  So they did an article in the Post today and on page 45, New York Pulse, they do the story with Neil Graves  and they interview people that just happen to be in the coffee shop doing their banking and having a cup of Joe, you know?  And, God.  So here's a quote from a guy.  If I didn't work a block away, I wouldn't go in.  And people who want to trade can do it from their laptop or a handheld device. 
[00:27:00]  Haywood Jablomi, 41, a Manhattan real estate agent, agreed.  This is a nice looking store, but I don't see people coming in here to trade.  He said, here, no way.  So Haywood is quoted in the Post today.  Haywood Jablomi.  Jablomi.  Jablomi.  Jablomi.  That guy must have laughed his ass off, not only saying it, but then reading it the next day.  Right.  Who falls for that gag?  Try to get a Michael Hunt in there.  That's got to be the best one. 
[00:27:30]  But it's funny when you see it in writing.  It's, yeah, the Post page 45, okay?  Haywood Jablomi.  We got the owner of Twinkles on the phone.  Twinkles the cat.  Rick, you're losing your effing mind.  Twinkles the dryer cat.  We can beat her.  Well, it was a pretty...  Hey, could Rachel hear us?  Okay, can you tell Rachel we're going to be with her in about 30 seconds?  Because we want to read the story.  It's very, very tragic what happened to her cat. 
[00:28:00]  Okay, she's off the line.  Did you see?  What a...  There you go.  What a crocodile.  This was in the Post today, right?  Yeah.  A tumble dry cat survives.  Twinkles the cat was in a tumble dryer for 15 minutes.  15 minutes?  And the cat survived.  Made it there.  And Rick wants to fly Twinkles in so he can have some kind of competition where we can  see if we can get a cat in the dryer for more than 15 minutes.  Oh, come on. 
[00:28:30]  You can't do that.  Twinkles.  How did Twinkles end up in the dryer?  Twinkles is the luckiest cat in the world after being tumble dried on high heat for 15 minutes  and surviving.  High heat.  It's a miracle he made it.  This cat has now used up about eight and a half of his nine lives, Twinkles owner Rachel  Wallace said.  Wallace of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, adopted the long-haired peline five years ago and quickly 
[00:29:00]  found he was curious about everything.  She had no idea Twinkles had climbed into the clothes dryer to investigate a new hiding  place.  So when she remembered a load of wet clothes she'd left in the dryer from the night before,  Wallace simply slammed the door and turned the heat up.  I put the dryer on high and went to sweep up in the kitchen.  About 15 minutes later, I heard this huge chunking, chunking, oh, clunking noise and  went to check it out.  She said, it was horrifying.  Wallace and her husband, Greg, brought the cat outside and poured cold water on him. 
[00:29:30]  Cool him off.  As their three kids washed in distress.  Then they were in shock.  It wasn't really dissimilar to an auto accident, Dr. Wayne Griffin said.  I was all beat up.  Yeah.  Twinkles sustained badly burned ears and fluid in his lungs.  Oh.  And, oh, this sucks.  Griffin had to amputate his badly mangled tail.  Oh, man.  He had to be fed through a syringe for four days but is now on the road to recovery, the  vet said.  Animal experts said it was a miracle the family pet survived considering the temperature 
[00:30:00]  inside the dryer reached up to 160 degrees.  He's, wow, that's superhuman.  I had told the kid that Twinkles was going to die but somehow he held on and kept fighting,  Wallace said.  The family said Twinkles will definitely never set foot in the dryer again.  He's purring once again and staying way clear of the laundry room, Wallace said.  Now that his tail is only an inch long, we're thinking of calling him Stubby.  Oh, so, Rick, what the hell do you want us to do with the owner of this cat? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I said we should try to beat the record and get a cat to stay in the dryer for 16 minutes.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, shit.  That must have been some static cling on a long-haired cat.  Big socks.  All right.  Twinkles owner.  All right, let's plunk Rachel down.  All right.  Rachel Wallace.  Hello there.  Hi, Rachel.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show live in New York City.  How are you?  Great.  How are you doing today? 
[00:31:00]  Pretty good.  Your story made the paper today.  Isn't that amazing?  Absolutely amazing.  We're pet lovers here in New York.  Well, we are here in Wisconsin, too.  We just want to know, how's Twinkles doing?  Well, Twinkles is doing better.  My God.  He doesn't look like himself.  He doesn't have a tail anymore.  And his ears are all burned.  But he's with us.  So, he's hanging in there.  So, they didn't give us much of the story in the paper today.  Could you, you know, just give us a little overview of what happened?  Sure.  It was on April 8th.  It was a Sunday afternoon.  And I came home from church and ate our Sunday dinner. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Thought I'd sweep the kitchen floor.  So, I was doing that.  And I thought, you know, I think I'll do some laundry while I'm at it.  Oh, laundry.  Yeah.  You know, I quickly went to the laundry room.  And there were some leftover kind of wrinkled towels and jeans in the dryer for the night before.  So, I just quickly shut the door, slammed the door, and cranked it up on high.  Oh, my goodness.  And the cute little puss-puss was in there.  Well, you know, unbeknownst to me.  So, I went back to my suite.  And I, I mean, I was doing a complete job.  I was moving furniture in the kitchen.  So, Rachel, you were the irresponsible one.  I was. 
[00:32:00]  I was the irresponsible pet owner.  So, you're the one responsible for the pet no longer having a tail.  I'll take full ownership for it.  Any guilt, Rachel?  Any guilt?  You're laughing.  It sounds like something serious.  No, I can laugh now.  I can laugh now.  And I've learned that we should all, all of us that have pets, should close the dryer door at all times.  Rachel, we are card-carrying members of the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals here.  And when we heard the story, we were horrified, quite frankly.  I know.  And I don't think you laugh. 
[00:32:30]  Please don't turn me in.  I don't think you laughing about this is.  No, no, I'm.  Rachel.  No, Rachel, you're talking to two big pussy lovers.  Okay.  And I don't think laughing.  Why is she laughing at us?  I'll stop laughing.  Why are you laughing?  I told the story about ten times today.  So, you have to just excuse me.  As well as the BBC.  I did an interview with the BBC last night of all things.  The English are fags.  There you go.  So, what happened was, is that I was sweeping, and I kept kind of hearing this kind of, it sounded like a zipper on one of my kids' jackets or something.  And I kind of ignored it.  That was probably Twinkle's teeth. 
[00:33:00]  What?  And it was about, oh, I don't know, 12, 13 minutes later that the noise got so loud that I thought, what is that clunky noise?  And I opened the dryer, and I was horrified.  It was our cat, and the cat was.  You sound horrified with all your laughing, Rachel.  There you go.  How am I doing?  And I was horrified.  The cat was, you know, blood was coming out of his ears, his nose, his mouth.  He was roasting.  I've learned now that dryers get up to about 160 degrees.  Dare I say it?  And he was gasping for air. 
[00:33:30]  Dare I say you had a bloody pussy in the dryer.  Okay.  I didn't say that.  You did.  But it was hot.  It was hot.  It was a cat, and it was bleeding, of course.  Yes.  He was gasping for air, and I ran downstairs, got my husband and our three children, and I came up, and my husband called the vet, and he said, oh, my cat down.  Yes.  So we brought it outside and proceeded to pour cold water over it.  We were pouring cold water down his throat.  I mean, anything we could do.  Oh, that.  And you felt that was good, being a veterinarian?  Well, let me tell you, at the moment, I was, you know, anything went. 
[00:34:00]  Wait, Rachel, I was interrupted.  I'm sorry.  They gave me my big cup of coffee, so I didn't get through this mess of a radio show.  So you brought the cat outside, and it was heated up?  It was heated up, and we cooled it down.  Oh, so you cooled the pussy.  Well, then, stop this now.  Well, then what we did is we told the kids that the cat was going to die.  So, of course, we were all bawling.  Of course, that my husband wasn't bawling, but we were all bawling.  And they were looking at you like the irresponsible bitch cat owner. 
[00:34:30]  Like, he did this, Mom.  Right, right.  Yeah, so the vet called back and said, I have an idea.  So we rushed it in the family van to the vet, and he gave it a steroid shot, a diuretic shot, and some other kind of shot.  And within about an hour, Twinkle started kind of looking like he was going to pull through, and he did.  Fascinating story.  He pulled through, and for the next four days, I breakfast, lunch, and dinner fed him with a syringe.  Because, of course, he couldn't move.  He couldn't walk.  He couldn't move.  Did the doctor have to shave your little pussy?  Oh, stop this now. 
[00:35:00]  What, I'm talking about the cat?  Now, the doctor did say...  I'm not the one that threw him in the dryer, Rachel.  You are.  All right.  I don't know what you call him in Wisconsin.  We call him pussies here in New York.  Right.  Kitties here.  Kitties.  Kitties.  Kitten.  Cats.  So he didn't have to shave down the pussy?  No, he didn't.  Right.  But he gave it a shot, and he survived.  There we say.  Although his tail died, became hard, and it died, and we had to have it amputated.  But, so if you'd like to make a donation to the Twinkles Amputation Fund, it was $220. 
[00:35:30]  I think you should pay for yourself.  Rachel, are you trying to say that something hard on your pussy had to be amputated?  Okay.  Now I'm going to be silent.  I'm just asking.  You said that the tail was hard.  That is correct.  It was on the pussy, and it had to be amputated, right?  That is correct.  Oh.  Oh.  That's correct.  And I loved you with a mangled pussy, I dare say.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a lot.  Mm-hmm.  Now Twinkles is okay? 
[00:36:00]  Well, Twinkles, you know, his ears are, like, burned off.  One of them, I think one of them is going to make it.  One of them is, like, kind of curled up like a potato chip, and it's kind of ready to chip off anyway.  He's formed, and probably is going to lead a horrible life of pain.  It is, yeah.  And it looks like a lynx now.  It looks like a lynx, because there's no tail.  So you're suggesting if people want a cat that looks like a lynx, you just throw him in the dryer?  I didn't say that.  Well, you did it.  You didn't have to say it.  Hey, Fred on Line 9 wants to know if the lint catcher in your dryer was full of pussy hair.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:36:30]  Good question.  No comment on that one.  Although, I did put a bounce sheet in it.  Oh, is that the joke you're telling us?  There you go.  That's funny.  It smells great.  Third joke here.  Now, how many lives do you think you're...  I think he used up about eight and a half.  Eight and a half?  I think he used up about eight and a half.  Half left.  He's got a half of life left.  I think put him in the washer ought to take care of that.  Maybe.  Well, Rachel, you and your pussy are quite famous today in New York City.  I guess.  Yeah.  And it looks like you've got a lovely daughter.  I see... 
[00:37:00]  Oh, she's great.  It looks like it's Sarah with the pre-washed pussy.  There you go.  It's something like that on the paper today.  Yep.  How about that?  What?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Does it say that?  It's like Sarah with the pre-washed pussy.  Whoa, what happened?  Rachel?  Yes?  I'm still here.  I'm sort of afraid to start talking again.  Why?  This is how we do our show.  I'm the mother of three children.  You know.  You put them in the dryer? 
[00:37:30]  They're in school, so they're not hearing them.  My infant crawled into the dryer.  But you kind of hurt our feelings.  This is how we do our radio.  Oh, I'm teasing.  That's okay.  You guys are doing a great job.  We're just trying to, you know, make it in radio.  I know.  And we thought we'd have a little fun with you and your pussy.  There you go.  And now I feel like I, I don't know, might have said something bad.  It's a little better if you make a donation to the Twinkle's Recovery Fund.  Are you insane?  Are you really trying to get money for Twinkle's? 
[00:38:00]  No, but this is going to cost us quite a lot of money.  Well, you should pay for it.  I know.  It's your own stupidity.  Why don't other people have to pay for it?  I'm happy to pay because this is our beloved family pack.  We don't pay for pussy around here.  He's worth this and more.  Rachel, why are you making money off your pussy?  I'm not making much.  What the hell?  Poor cat.  Unbelievable.  She's actually trying to turn a dime.  She was a hooah.  And how the hell do you make money off a mangled pussy?  Right.  You're horrible.  You're a horrible woman. 
[00:38:30]  What kind of money do you want for that cat?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of money?  Yeah.  How much are you trying to scrape up?  220 bucks.  If all of your listeners maybe sent 50 cents to the Twinkle's Recovery Fund, we could get  this thing paid for.  Hey, you wouldn't happen to have an email address, would you?  I do.  That would help.  That would help because all of our listeners would be behind little Twinkle's.  Yes, they would.  I'll give it to you afterwards.  Well, this is your opportunity.  We have a few listeners.  It is in New York. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, we're in last place, but we're trying to do good radio every day.  Yeah.  There's somebody listening to this.  Yeah.  What's your email address, Rachel?  No, I don't know.  I think I lost it.  Oh, here it is.  You want money?  Yeah.  You know how many pet lovers we have listening to us?  Do you have some pet lovers?  How come they send me money if you're my email address?  Well, they'll write you and ask you where they can send you.  How about if they send it to your radio station?  Rachel, let me tell you.  You'll give them the address of your radio station.  Rachel, we don't have time for that.  And I'll tell you why we want your email address, okay? 
[00:39:30]  You ask the question.  We give out an address on the air.  Right.  But see, if you give out the email, then people, you know, write you, and then you give them the address.  I'll give it to you guys afterwards.  And if you really want to give it out, you can give it out.  But I'll give it to you guys afterwards.  All right.  I'm too scared.  You know, I'm the mother of three.  Three little children?  Three little precious children.  Three children.  And a great husband.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what's Twinkles doing today?  Twinkles is lounging around the house.  I left this morning. 
[00:40:00]  I had done an interview in California.  You know, the amazing thing is that his brain is 100% there.  How do you know?  I mean, picture yourself tumbling in a drive-in with 50 minutes on high heat.  I mean, would your brain be there?  And his brain is there.  You don't know if the brain is there.  You're fried.  Well, he's back to his old behaviors.  You're fried your pussy's brain.  He's back to his old behaviors.  I hear you were just trying to imitate a stunt that you saw on Jackass.  Is that true?  Because I was and that show was off the air. 
[00:40:30]  No.  Horrible.  No.  I had no idea the cat had crawled in the dryer.  But, you know, I learned my lesson now.  I check my dryer many times before I do any kind of laundry.  I'm kind of paranoid in the laundry room now.  Hey, do you have a...  Is your pussy fixed?  Yes, it is.  Oh.  Yeah, but he still pretends like he's not fixed.  With the heat?  You know, yeah, it's a heat.  Did it burn anything off?  No, things are still working.  He's there.  That's horrible.  I know.  What a horrible story.  I know.  Well, we want to thank you for doing this interview with us. 
[00:41:00]  Well, sure.  No problem.  Yeah.  I hope it was fun for you.  It was fun.  Okay.  What did that little pussy smell like when it came out of the dryer?  Mountain spring air.  Really?  I think that was the bounce.  And he sat a cling.  Hey, Rachel, we can only dream, you know.  Oh, my gosh.  You know, we got to the vet, and the first thing the vet said is, well, did he shrink?  Oh.  He was crying, and the vet says, well, did it shrink?  I guess it was a vet humor.  That's a funny vet. 
[00:41:30]  I know.  Vet humor, yes.  Dr. Wayne Griffin.  And give that email address out one more time.  For who?  For you.  For the listeners.  Okay, hang up the phone, and then I'll give it to you.  Hang up the phone, and we're...  Hang up.  Okay, I'll give it to you.  Go ahead.  All right.  W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L at shipfalls, D-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S dot, this is long now, K-1-2 dot W-I dot U-S. 
[00:42:00]  This is your email address?  I work at a school.  I'm a counselor in a school.  Oh, great.  Yep.  Don't you guys got, like, cable modems?  I don't know.  This is how the Wisconsin school system email thing works.  There's something called AOL.  Look into it.  I know.  No, I should consider that.  I can't afford it because I'm too busy paying this bill.  Oh, she's trying to get the cash.  Well, the way you get it, give that address out one more time.  Okay, W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L at shipfalls, D-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S dot, K-12 dot, W-I dot, U-S. 
[00:42:30]  There you go.  Did you have to explain to your students about the tragedy of your little pussy?  Well, you know, I'm a drug counselor.  Oh, you are?  I am.  What grade do you teach?  Well, I'm a counselor in a high school.  I work with a freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.  Hey, what kind of drugs are the high school kids doing these days?  Oh, no.  We're a little out of touch. 
[00:43:00]  Are you?  Are they doing the E?  They are.  They like the E, right?  A lot of alcohol, a lot of pot, and then all those other drugs.  You know what a good buzz is?  No.  You hop in a dryer for 15 minutes.  I've heard that.  You will be spinning.  I'm thinking you were on the E to allow your cats to get trapped in a dryer.  I'm clean.  For how long?  Oh, you know, I've never been chemically dependent.  But I actually am a teetolder, and I've had any kind of drug, even including alcohol, for about 18 years I'm sober.  What was the last drug you did?  Margarita.  That's not a drug. 
[00:43:30]  Well, technically, alcohol is a drug.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a lifeline.  Well, no, no.  Try for me at T-47.  Got that.  Do you really want to open up that can of worms with me?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  Well, I mean, there are more people with alcohol problems in the United States than any other drug combined.  Hey, you could go after yourself.  Don't you agree?  I mean, most kids start out with cigarettes, and they go to alcohol, and cops, and other drugs.  So it kind of starts out right away.  Well, you know, we've got to sit in the herd, though. 
[00:44:00]  And coming from a woman that put her cat in the dryer?  Yeah, I'll take that advice.  I know.  I've been waiting for this.  Stone sober.  I know.  I'm sober.  All right.  I did it with a sober mind.  Okay.  Rachel Wallace.  All righty.  I'm sure our listeners will send you plenty of cash.  You get me nothing.  You lose.  You guys have a great day.  And we're glad your pussy's doing well.  I am, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye.  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Rachel Wallace.  Rachel Wallace.  Owner of Twinkles, the Miracle Cat. 
[00:44:30]  The Miracle Pussy.  She must have been...  All right.  That rocked.  Yeah, good.  Good interview.  See, that's a good interview right there.  Nice.  Here's the new chick.  They better not have dumped out of that.  I was talking about a cat the whole damn time.  Of course.  What would they dump?  We'd be irresponsible if we took any of the phone calls on the phone screen right now.  Right.  No one has pet roosters.  Wow, a naked girl.  Hey. 
[00:45:00]  How you doing?  It's freezing in here.  We try to keep it that way.  Look at you.  You are completely and totally naked.  You know, naked girls never get old, man.  I was getting lines.  You were what?  I was getting lines for my things I was on.  Oh, you're getting the lines off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, like, your pants leave impressions on you.  Hey, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  You got a...  It's going away.  We got a very, very nice-looking lady in the studio.  Where are you from?  Um, Massachusetts.  Oh, yeah?  Do you remember us from Boston?  Yes, and the same year I moved here, you guys moved here. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  We were following you.  I'm so excited.  Nice.  Charlie following you.  Oh, well, now it's scary.  Here, stand up on the chair and spin around and stuff.  Yeah, hold the chair.  Make sure she doesn't fall.  And what are you sporting there?  You got a, um...  That is a mohawk.  Yeah, it's a nice...  Very well-groomed.  Yeah, spin around.  Oh, tattoos.  That's good.  Yeah.  What do you got?  You got a lot of cats.  That's a fairy.  That's a fairy.  Girls like the fairy right by the, uh...  The area.  Hey, I like your cat.  Put the mic up there.  And that's Twinkle.  That's Twinkle right there. 
[00:46:00]  Is it that?  Yeah.  In her lap is Twinkle.  I like your Twinkle.  And then what you got down there by the ankles, some kind of Egyptian work?  What does that mean?  That's the stability of a tattoo.  Oh, of course.  You got some cool...  Why?  No, you really got some cool tattoos.  What's the...  What's the armband signify?  I like stability and strength.  Yeah, that's more Egyptian stuff.  Egyptian stuff, man.  Yeah.  You're going to see the mummy, too?  Yeah.  Can we wrap you up like a mummy?  The Rock's in it.  I suppose he is.  The Rock's in it.  The Rock's in it for 10 minutes.  He dies.  Oh, what? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  Stop.  What happened?  But he's got to come back.  He's a Scorpion.  Doesn't he come back?  Hey, can we take toilet paper and wrap you up like a mummy?  Yeah.  Cool.  Let's make her a mummy.  Yeah, you're going to be our first mummy.  You'll be our first mummy.  We'll wrap you up in toilet paper.  Well, first, we'll get her in her whipped cream bikini.  She's got a very nice body.  Very nice.  Yeah, look at that.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a model, and I also do B-movies.  You do B-movies?  I'm a B-movies.  I got some stuff through that.  Hey, do you do like the B-movie girl scream thing?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  I was at Killa this weekend. 
[00:47:00]  I host a lot of shows.  I got one in June and June 9th in Washington, Missouri.  Let's hear a B-movie girl scream.  Good scream.  You're being murdered.  Go ahead.  No scream.  Here's the knife.  I do more laughing than scream.  All right, let's hear her laugh.  Oh, that guy's going to call us that, like, chick's laughing at him.  Wow, she's feeling her own you-know-what.  You ever...  That's my thinking mode.  When you need to think, you have to grab them like that.  Hey, me too.  Looks like you're Einstein. 
[00:47:30]  You don't dance or anything?  What kind of B-movies do you do?  You can sit back down.  You're making me nervous.  Seduction Cinema.  Seduction Cinema?  Seduction Cinema.  I got a movie for you, guys.  All right, can we...  All right, we're going to take a break.  You're going to get into your whipped cream bikini,  and we want to talk to you some more.  It sounds like you got a couple stories to tell.  Yeah, I got a lot of stories.  They're all lesbian movies, too.  Oh, damn it.  Go away.  Lesbian seduction B-movies.  Yeah.  Nice.  Do you make balloon animals?  No, that's why I was on.  I love you, guys. 
[00:48:00]  Do you want to be in Slap Happy?  Volume 6?  It's new producers.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, cool.  And Rick...  You take it.  Get into your whipped cream bikini,  and then come on back in, all right?  We're going to take a quick break.  You're very lovely.  Rick, don't grab the back of her head.  Look, she's beating him up.  She's kicking his ass.  Rick's getting beat up by a naked woman.  The second time a naked woman's beating someone up in this studio.  Thank God it's not me this time.  All right, cool.  And what's your name again?  Darian.  Darian.  Darian.  I don't even know if she said her name. 
[00:48:30]  Darian.  You know, this proves that she's hot,  because Pete the Engineer is, like,  just drooling outside the studio.  I stepped away from the coffee machine.  All right, a quick break, and we'll continue.  Ladies, come on down and get your whipped cream bikini, please.  I got a soda, Bacata coffee cup.  We need more than one lady today.  Yes.  All right.  Look at him.  Hey, I fixed your bullhorn.  Shut up.  Get Pete in here for a sec.  Pete.  Hey, Pete.  I got a soda, Bacata coffee cup.  Pete. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, Pete.  Pete, what do you think?  Where'd he go?  There he is.  What do you think, Pete?  I wasn't really looking, because I'm basically involved with the next show that comes on.  I'm on a syndicated show.  Oh, so he's not looking at anything we do, because you're loyal to another program.  Well, that's good.  Well, I'm not loyal to him.  Why is everyone's head around here getting big, except Ant and I?  Hey, you're now part of a syndicated talk show? 
[00:49:30]  Something going on out here?  So what's going to happen when we get syndicated?  I do interviews.  Then you're going to start kissing our ass, right?  Yeah.  At least he's honest.  I do interviews.  So you're not going to look at the naked girl because you're part of another radio show?  Well, I wasn't really paying attention, really.  You know, it's become like commonplace around here now, so I don't really...  Oh, there you go.  Excuse me.  Commonplace.  Just remember what this place was like before we came here.  There was no naked women around ever, ever, ever. 
[00:50:00]  You're right.  All right.  Hey, Pete, come here.  No nudity, but we'll do shots.  The same bottle Keith Moon drank right before he dropped dead.  But now you got naked shit.  We should get the naked girl to beat you up, I think.  No.  No?  I have a syndicated show to do.  All right.  Go do your syndicated talk show.  Thank you.  All right.  And you're allowed to take Donna Mike on our show.  But you didn't have the balls to say it, did you?

Now we're talking about a cat here.  Cats.  Don't dump out of this.  Moral of the story, always dry your pussy naturally. 
[00:53:00]  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Listen to Rod and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All, all, all owned.  By Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  212-757-1027.  You can do it.  You can do it.  Do it.  You can do it.  You can do it. 
[00:53:30]  You can do it.  Hey, Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie and Andy?  What's up, guys?  I hate when people say that.  I'm sorry.  All right, come on.  Oh, come on.  I'm just kidding.  Anyway, listen, I got a problem.  I need some help.  Yeah.  I attend a bar in a bar in New Jersey.  Last night, it's me and the owner's wife, right?  I'm about 29.  She's like 40.  We're closing out.  We're having a few drinks, laughing, all of this.  All of a sudden, she comes around the bar.  She unbuckles my belt and goes down on me, right?  Stop.  And, uh...  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I don't know what to do.  I don't even think I can pull in there. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know what to do.  I need some help.  What do you think I should do?  I'm freaked.  I don't know what to do.  If I see this guy, I'm just going to, like, imagine his wife around me, you know, and I can't.  What am I going to do?  You don't work at Badaving, do you?  No.  I hope not.  I don't know what to do, though.  They got the best BJ girls in the land.  Yeah.  She's got nice lips.  I'll tell you what, man.  She did a good job.  She had the lower lip drag?  Yeah, she was great.  Yeah, the drag.  The funniest thing about it was, is afterwards, I'm going down, I'm closing out my register,  and I'm doing my credit card thing, and it says a big sign right on the side of our credit card machine. 
[00:54:30]  It says, Deposit your batch daily.  I'm like, oh, what is going on around here?  You got all the signs around you.  It's very obvious what you got to do, JJ.  Just keep your mouth shut.  Yeah, no, but I don't know.  What if she comes on to me again?  What am I going to do?  Should I just take it or what?  Just keep your mouth shut.  All right, guys.  If you guys have any advice, man, I need some help.  Hey, JJ, the guy that owns the place, he's not connected or anything, is he?  He's Italian, but I don't know if he's a friend of ours.  A club, a club.  What's the name of the bar? 
[00:55:00]  I am not going to say that.  I thought I'd get you.  Hey, what town is this in, though?  This is in Warren.  Warren, um.  New Jersey.  Oh, yeah, Warren, New Jersey.  Warren, New Jersey.  Hey, there's a bunch of great bars down there.  Yeah, there's some cool stuff around here.  Yeah.  Anyway, if your listeners got any advice for me, I need some help, because I don't know if this  guy's going to wring my neck or what.  You're going to do it on the pool table?  I don't know if I, I mean, she's hot and everything, but I don't even know if I want  to go again.  I'm like.  You got a pool table?  I might be gun shy.  Yeah, we got a pool table.  All right.  I don't know if I, I might be gun shy now, you know? 
[00:55:30]  I don't know.  You guys got a busy night tonight, though?  Maybe you could talk to her.  I don't know.  What is it, Tuesday night?  Yeah.  I'm not going to be too busy.  Not like dart night or anything?  No, no.  No, our pool league's tomorrow.  Pool league's tomorrow?  But, you know, the thing about it is, is that if she's, I don't know if she's even  going to be there.  But if she is, you know, I mean, I'm going to like, I'm going to have like a, do the  buddy system and have somebody with me at all times.  You know what I hate about bars?  What's that?  They don't have ladies' nights anymore.  I know, right?  That's because too many drunk bitches wrap themselves around poles, you know? 
[00:56:00]  You can't, what are you going to do?  Right.  Yeah.  You guys do any crazy drink specials?  Yeah, we do.  We do some shot specials and stuff like that.  I try to get girls in the bar to pour shots.  You know, it's not like that out here.  Yeah.  No?  It's not like Bar New York or anything like that.  You know what else?  You know what I hate is the shot girls.  I knew, I'm reading Anthony's mind.  You don't like the shot girls?  Not really.  The ones that walk around with those gay-ass test tube things, those suck.  Yeah, well, you guys don't.  If the girls that get up on the bar and pour it down your throat, then that's all right, 
[00:56:30]  though.  You guys don't do the test tube shots, right?  No, no.  Let me tell you, because they're too pushy, and you start thinking, wow, does she come  on up to me?  And they taste like S. That stuff tastes like S, man.  I know.  It's just so horrible.  You know what else is cool?  You know what I like in a bar, though?  What's that?  They're like old memorabilia hanging up.  If it's a nautical theme or something, you'll see like fishnets and things hanging in the  rafters.  Oh, you like that?  I think that only goes good with like sports themes.  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  Fisherman's Wharf or whatever.  They don't do that?  No.  I've been down to like the Warren, New Jersey area. 
[00:57:00]  There's no real sports bars.  No.  No, no, no.  We're like a county bar, you know?  Can I catch the game there, though?  You got TVs?  Yeah, you've got TVs.  We've got satellites, whatever.  You know what?  There's a lot of Irish bars in that neck of the woods.  He said this is an Italian guy, though.  This is an Italian guy.  It's not like an Italian bar, is it?  No, no, no.  And he's no friends of ours, you know?  No, huh?  No.  These aren't goombas, but I don't know.  I mean, maybe.  I don't know where he gets his money from.  So the locals, like guys that just hang out all the time? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, it's like Vietnam vets, you know, your occasional 20-something dorks.  You don't have like the high school guys that like graduated like 10 years ago?  Oh, yeah.  We got them talking about like, what was that third baseman's name?  Now, that guy could dwell.  What's his name on?  Yeah.  I hate that.  Oh, they hash over all past high school glory.  Oh, that's all they do.  And then like every night they're in the same place on the same bar school talking about  the same game that they played 12 years ago.  It's like, get a life.  And that's in your bar?  That's in my bar.  So everyone from Warren High School goes there?  I don't know. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I'm not even from Warren.  I'm from up north a little bit, but.  Right, right, right.  Wow.  I don't know.  Luckily, I don't know all these punches, but.  You got more than one pool table or just one?  No, we got one.  I hate that.  You got to wait while the pool's short for the night.  You got like one guy that usually kicks ass all the time.  Yeah, it's a buck 25, too.  It's like a total rip-off, you know?  Yeah.  JJ, why is your bar named an Irish bar if like an Italian guy owns it?  It's not named an Irish bar.  No.  He didn't say anything. 
[00:58:30]  He didn't say no name.  Come on.  No, no.  I just want to know.  You serve food?  Yeah.  Yeah, what do you got?  Well, burgers, wings.  You're doing that Mexican food?  No.  The Cinco de Mayo is coming up.  Yeah, I know that.  We're going to have some mad tequila, you guys.  That's a dance work.  You got any of the wacky names?  Because I know a lot of people, they don't just say Buffalo Wings.  They have like a wacky name for them.  No, we call them Wings.  Ah.  Tencent Wings.  Tencent Wings.  Nice.  That's pretty good, though. 
[00:59:00]  You watching the game?  Tencent Wings?  Yeah.  You got any draft special?  I'm going to come down tomorrow night and watch the devil kick some butt.  We'll come down?  Tomorrow.  What's the cover tomorrow?  There's no cover.  No cover?  Never a cover.  You got at least a band playing after the game's over?  I don't know.  You got to bring someone and we'll have a band.  Oh, you guys don't do the band then?  We got room for it.  We never do it, though.  Nobody comes there.  You know, I don't know.  It's not like just that kind of area.  Like, people don't come to this area to like a little bar.  It sounds like a real town-y place.  Yeah.  It's real dark and stuff. 
[00:59:30]  I was at a place like that.  What was the name?  Orphan Annie's.  Yeah.  You know that place?  You go through, like, tons of Yukon Jacks, that tells you what kind of clientele you have.  You ever hear of that place?  Orphan Annie's?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've heard of it.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  I've been there.  That's all right.  So, any advice?  What do you think should I do?  I'm, like, about to pull into this place.  Wait, wait, what's wrong with Orphan Annie's?  What do they ever do to you?  Yeah.  Is that your competition or something?  No, no.  I'm not going to plug some other bar.  I'm not even plugging my bar.  What do I care?  There's only one bar I've gone to down there. 
[01:00:00]  I think it was called, shoot, Colorado Cafe.  Colorado Cafe?  Yeah.  I don't know that one.  Jimmy D.  Is that by Noel Connors?  Huh?  Oh, there's a place called O'Connors right around here.  That's near you, O'Connors.  Oh, okay.  I know exactly where you are.  Is that the lounge?  The lounge?  Sherwood Lounge?  No, it's not that way.  You ever been to Jimmy Z's, Gillette Pub?  Jimmy Z's?  No.  I've never been down there.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I live up north, Bergen County, so.  Oh, you do? 
[01:00:30]  You live in Bergen County?  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  All right, guys, I'm about to pull in here.  So, if, you know, something bad happens, I'll call you back.  Is she bartending?  No, she doesn't tend bars.  She does the books.  She does the books.  Yeah.  And some other things I found out last night.  Obviously.  And they got that sign on the register.  What did that say?  It's a sign on the credit card machine that says, deposit your batch daily.  Jesus.  JJ.  All right, I got to go, guys.  Talk to you later.  No, JJ, in all honesty, keep your mouth shut, you know?  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.  Because it looks like you. 
[01:01:00]  But I'll still try to follow the advice of the credit card machine, though.  Just not at all.  So, you're going to go for it again?  No, I don't know.  I don't think so.  You guys don't do any of that stupid karaoke, do you?  No.  Oh, thank God.  Actually, I would consider to do it just as, like, a goof, just to see how, you know,  like, how...  Are you, like, the manager?  ...people will be?  What?  Are you the manager?  Yeah.  Oh, well, that's cool.  Yeah, well, you know.  Sorry.  You make good tips from the townies?  No.  You've got to learn the bar mop sweep with the, you know, when the money's on the bar. 
[01:01:30]  You've got to, you know, kind of go and wash the bar, you know, dry up the bar and kind  of dig your little bit out of it, you know?  You ever been to Christine's?  Yes, I've been there.  Pretty good place?  That's right.  Boy, what's wrong with all these bars?  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with them, but I don't know.  I'm not putting anybody down, you know?  So, they're the competition, too?  No, I don't know.  They're not even geographically near us, really.  Guy's trying to figure this out.  What, have you got the bar and the phone book out?  No, I just kind of want to, like, hook up and go down and watch the devil. 
[01:02:00]  I'll tell you what.  Take me off the air, and I'll tell you where to go.  We'll come down, and we'll set you guys up.  You come down for 10-cent wingers and dollar drafts.  All right.  And dollar drafts?  That's right.  Can we go to the music?  Oh, God, I hate this music thing.  What's the music?  We will be back with our regularly scheduled program right after this.  All right.  Talk to you guys later, everybody.  Hey, hold on.  We're off the air.  What's the name?  All right.  Deposit your back daily, buddy.  What's the name of the place? 
[01:02:30]  Hello?  He hung up.  God damn it.  Well, he gave a lot of information.  Come on.  Come on!  Well, hey, where's that naked girl?  Just hang it out.  All right.  Still naked?  Yeah.  All right.  Bring her in here.  She's laying around naked.  See, get her.  She's laying on the lesbian cast.  It's naked.  Oh, yeah?  Don't lay on that naked.  Oh, my God.  You'll get cornucopia from her. 
[01:03:00]  Hundreds of stuff.  Hundreds of stuff.  Yeah, because...  You have no problem being naked.  I used to go.  I wanted to see you guys, so I had a lot of stuff.  How old a gal are you, if we can ask?  Yes, yes.  And then I won't still untie.  Oh, you remind me of somebody.  You remind me of the girl that used to do naked poetry on our show when we first came here.  No, she's not that crazy.  I didn't say crazy look-wise, though.  Oh, really?  I don't even remember.  I was cowering in the corner with my hands over my face.  The girl that did the naked poetry wrapped in Christmas lights.  She looked a lot like her. 
[01:03:30]  She used to give BJs in the park during Shakespeare in the Park, right?  Shakespeare.  I swear to God.  What do you got there, a picture?  A picture.  And you're covered in little rose petals.  Very nice.  What town in Mass are you from?  Amherst.  Amherst, man.  Amherst, man.  Nice.  You got a shirt.  Oh, you guys sent us the DVD of this.  Did we?  I sent you.  I got you this.  This is kind of like soft porn.  Erotic Survivor.  Yeah.  You're like soft porn B-movie chick.  But do you get it in the movies? 
[01:04:00]  Do you like?  No, they can't film that part.  But you are getting it, but they just don't film it.  The girls I work with all the time, you get sick of doing them.  You know, you get tired.  Yeah, I understand that.  But the new girls, hell yeah.  And I always get all the girls first.  Oh, nice.  So all these are like...  They always send me the new ones.  These are all lesbian B-movies, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  Oh, so there's no C in there.  They have a movie called Erotic Survivor and the Erotic Witch Project.  See, you come up with any ideas that haven't been made already? 
[01:04:30]  Or you just think it's kind of fun to...  They just add erotic to the title.  No, all of them are just parodies.  Parodies?  Hilarious.  We just make a fool out of ourselves.  And this is like the girls running through the woods, being chased by a witch, and then  you all of a sudden start munching some crumpet.  She's a witch that makes us horny.  The witch makes you horny.  Look at that.  What a witch.  That's great.  Now, that's a good witch.  The Erotic Witch Project.  Great.  Okay.  Darian Cain. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, what is this?  Wow, you got a stake through your chest.  Look at that.  That's a hot picture.  I do horror stuff.  Seriously, that's a hot picture.  You do naked horror stuff.  Yeah.  Naked horror things.  DarksideofDarianCain.com  Ordering to sing!  Ordering to sing!  You don't have a brother that does radio in New York, do you?  No.  Okay.  Slash.  Great.  Did you take your pictures yet?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, you did?  I got all sticky.  Did you?  Yeah.  I didn't do the whole thing. 
[01:05:30]  You just went for the little...  Yeah, she just covered the...  She went for the dollop.  I had a couple of...  The girls are going for the dollops these days.  When this contest first started over a week ago, it was like, it was a real bikini.  Yeah, pretty much.  And now they're just going with the dollop to cover the naughty...  They're going with the Annette Funicello bikini.  Huh?  So we could, like, eat it off each other.  Well, if you want to hang around, we could get a girl to do a lesbian thing, would you?  Where are they?  I don't know.  If there's any girls in the area that want to be a lesbian for a day, this lovely lady  will help you out. 
[01:06:00]  Whipped cream lesbian.  That'd be nice, right?  Hey, by the way, do not sit on that couch out there naked.  I put a towel over it.  All right, because that's a lesbian couch.  Could you look at the couch?  Yeah.  There's some stains on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy has seen Erotic Witch Project.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, man?  I saw the movie.  That movie's really, really hot.  I think Julie Strains in it.  Am I right?  No, that's the Bear Witch Project.  No, no.  Oh, is that what that is?  The Blair Witch. 
[01:06:30]  What?  The Bear.  Oh, the Bear Witch Project?  I think I saw them before.  This girl's really hot.  She's blonde, right?  No, this girl is brunette with a couple different colors in her hair.  Well, she's probably hot.  She's sexy, man.  She's hot, right?  She has no problem being naked.  She's just kind of sitting there.  Yeah.  With big boobs.  Kind of hanging out.  What did you say?  I sit here when I'm shooting movies naked.  I never get that.  Yeah?  Why bother?  Are you working on any new movies?  I just finished one.  It was a vampire one.  What was it called?  I think they're going to change the name, but it's like Bloodletting Vampire something. 
[01:07:00]  You got to get Erotic in the title.  No, they don't have Erotic in the title.  Muffy the Vampire Slayer?  And then I did I See Dead Strippers.  That was pretty cool.  You what?  You did a movie I See?  I See Dead Strippers.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Like there's this geeky guy that sees Dead Strippers.  And I'm one of the Dead Strippers.  You got a sex sense.  Yeah.  The Erotic Mummy Returns.  Anything like that?  You guys can treat that.  On Erotic Golden Pond?  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  She thinks it's historical.  Why is that movie historical?  I See Dead Strippers?  Yeah.  Just the name.  Think about it.  Yeah, that's definitely funny.  But I mean, you know, what's the movie about?  Is the geeky guy dead through the whole movie?  No, the geeky guy's alive.  We're dead.  He sees us.  No twist ending?  He's going crazy now.  Pretty funny, though.  Erotic Star Wars?  Nice.  Just put Erotic in front of anything.  I don't care.  We have other movies besides that.  Erotic Joe Dirk?  We have Gladiator Eroticus.  Do you?  Gladiator Eroticus. 
[01:08:00]  Good.  Keeping with the theme.  I like it.  Revenge of the Erotic Nerd?  That wasn't erotic.  That was just me for the Frankenstein.  Yeah?  Is there, like, a Russell Crowe look-alike in the Gladiator?  Yeah, me.  Oh, you play the lead?  I'm Russell Crowe.  Eric, Russell Crowe never looks so good.  Eric, Russell's got a nice can.  Sure.  Uh, Eric.  Yo.  What's up?  This movie, The Writer Witch Project, is like a total spankfest, dude. 
[01:08:30]  Why?  Yeah?  Dude, yeah.  It's totally hot.  There's this one scene in the tent where she starts feeling up the blonde chick.  Yeah.  Be careful how you describe.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Go ahead.  But she's, like, half asleep, and then Darian reaches over and just starts totally feeling  her up.  And the scene gets really hot, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  She's a hot girl.  All the movies, uh, you know, the one company, though, were, like, totally B, so you can totally  see, like, cameras and shots and stuff, but...  Yeah.  See, that's like the old Ed Wood stuff, man. 
[01:09:00]  Nothing wrong with that.  Cut, print it, perfect.  Move on.  Right.  But it's totally great stuff.  Darian makes some good movies.  Right.  All right.  Any erotic witch project?  Did somebody come out of the tent and just see a pile of naked girls?  No.  What's that?  We find dildos everywhere, though.  Can I say that?  Oh, you find dildos?  That's funny.  Come on.  We find dildos.  Like a pile of dildos?  Yeah, but they're all mine, because they made me bring all my dildos.  So mine are, like, laying in the woods.  So you can see what kind of dildos you got.  Next to a blow-up doll. 
[01:09:30]  My porn magazines are there.  Do they make anything, though?  Are they, like, I don't know?  Yeah, they made, we made, like, well, we made it, so it looks like the witch made it.  The Blair Witch, uh, Kate?  No, it was little sticks that said, eat me.  Your dildos spelled out, eat me.  I gotta see this now.  No, don't jump out at all.  We don't know what eat me means.  That sounds great.  All right, we got a copy of the erotic, uh, witch Blair thing.  The erotic bridges in Madison County?  What's he talking about?  They got a new, watch that one.  They got a new version of Blow coming out.  Erotic Blow. 
[01:10:00]  Erotic Blow.  Nice.  Now, that rocks.  Now, that's a movie I'd go see.  Has nothing to do with cocaine.  Hey, we got, hey, this is getting better.  We got the writer and director of I See Dead Strippers, uh, Terry West.  Yes.  Oh, Terry!  Hey, Terry and sweetie, how you doing, babe?  We know each other.  Oh, yeah, very well.  So you wrote it?  I wrote it, directed it, and produced it.  Are you in it?  Uh, yes, I am.  I play a clown with diarrhea.  You play a clown with diarrhea?  Yes, it's a very funny scene. 
[01:10:30]  This is getting better and better.  It does.  It's, uh, basically, it's, uh, the twist ending is, uh, Barbara Joyce, another actress from a bunch of, uh, Showtime, Penthouse kind of stuff.  Yeah?  She plays the doctor.  All right.  So instead of like, uh, remember where Bruce Willis says, for every question I answer correctly, take a step toward me?  Yes.  Same thing, but with her, it's taking off a piece of clothing.  Nice.  Yeah, you guys are going to get a copy when it's out.  You guys are thinking.  You guys are thinking over there.  Yeah, well, I did a serious film called Blood for the Muse, which nobody's buying. 
[01:11:00]  Ah, see, smut always sells.  That's right.  So we, we sell this, uh, we sell the smut to make more movies like Blood for the Muse.  What other, uh, wacky titles, uh, changes are you doing for a movie?  Well, we're doing the lesbian hunter.  It's probably the crocodile hunter, but it's the guy who's out, uh, hunting lesbians.  Hunting lesbians.  And he's got the Aussie accent and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Look at this lesbian.  I'm going to try to put my thumb in a bum.  He's going into a death row.  There you go. 
[01:11:30]  But can I, can I give the, uh, the website for Death Strippers?  Yeah, because you guys gave us some good stuff today.  Well, before you give the website, though, you got to explain your scene as the, uh, the clown with diarrhea.  Okay.  Because I can't let that go.  So the main character goes to a, uh, he, here's a knock at the door.  He opens the door and there's a clown just freaking out.  This demonic looking clown throws him against the wall.  Turns out he's doing a kid's birthday party and the kid stopped at the toilet and he's about to die.  So there's about five minutes of the clown making noise in the bathroom. 
[01:12:00]  And, uh, when he leaves, he gives the kid a balloon, pats him on the cheek.  And when the kid turns, you see like these brown fingerprints on the kid's face.  It's everything, everything men like is in here.  I mean, farts, diarrhea, clowns.  And girls with big boobs, yeah.  And real hot lesbian stuff in there, too.  You have big boobs.  Those are a nice sign.  No, they're not.  They're very proportionate.  More body.  That's like a C.  Yeah, but.  He's good.  Nothing wrong with a C.  Natural C, nice.  I'm thinking right now, what am I going to say next? 
[01:12:30]  And they got a, they're very nice.  They're not, uh, sandy or nothing.  No.  Good job.  Good job, what?  Keeping up on your boobs.  Got a lot of, some girls let them go.  You got a lot of braille bumps around the nip.  Nice.  You wear a broader bed?  I have to.  That's how you keep it from saying that.  See?  That's brilliant.  So if some guy takes it off, he's going to put it back on.  Put it back on after they're done?  After you're done?  That's always a drag.  It's hard enough trying to get it off.  How the hell are you going to put it back on?  Erotic spy kids, Rick.  Stop it. 
[01:13:00]  All right, so, yeah, what do you want to give out, Terry?  Deadstrippers.com.  Oh, that's easy.  Deadstrippers.com.  Oh, you did?  Thank you, sweetie.  I appreciate that.  And could you do erotic Ford Fairlane?  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm up for anything.  The last movie I made bombed.  Which way?  When it's done, guys, you get a copy.  Here's a title for you.  Erotic Snatch.  Oh, the movie Snatch that just came out.  Based on the Brad Pitt movie, sure.  He was in it for like five seconds, wasn't he?  What, Snatch? 
[01:13:30]  Oh, he was in the Snatch for five seconds.  He was in the Snatch for five seconds?  Who even knows?  All right, David, now you've taken it too far on line three.  Oh, when I ever see erotic Schindler's List?  That's sick.  Hot.  Oh, God.  All right, I guess erotic doesn't work for everyone.  No.  You guys are the greatest.  I got a bell.  I listen to you every day.  I love you.  Thank you.  Terry West.  Thank you for the promotion, and you will get a copy.  All right, cool.  All right, guys, take care.  Bye, Derek.  We need Spielberg when we have Terry West.  Is Scott working on getting her pictures up on www.com? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  All right.  She's going to be in the whipped cream and candy contest.  Yeah.  Well, he's too busy, you know, taking a look at your pictures for himself.  This keyboard looks like a glazed donut.  Let's just put it this way.  He has a sneeze guard on his computer.  Oh, they're up?  Darian's up.  There she is.  The girl we're talking to, www.com.  Wow, you chose not to use much whipped cream there.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, nice.  Very nice. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Wow, nice.  Here's another finalist.  Yes, we definitely have our seventh finalist.  Definitely.  Not even joking.  Connor.  Oh, hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  That one.  Oh, I just want to say, I saw that erotic Blair Witch or whatever, and it's so funny  because, like, at times they'll be looking right into the camera, and then it's like someone  tells them to move, so they just, like, hop.  Oh, like kind of looking at the camera, but...  Yeah, like they're not supposed to.  Is it like the scene in Pee-wee's Playhouse when Pee-wee got the part in the movie, Beijing 
[01:15:00]  Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call at the front desk, and then he makes those eyes  and walks to the side.  That video is so funny, but it's so hot, too.  That's a good movie, huh?  Thank you, Connor.  All right, over and out, Diamond Dust.  Hey, what else can we do with you?  What do you want to do?  We need another girl to come down, obviously, to the whipped cream lesbian thing.  Oh, we have to make a mummy out of you.  We'll make a mummy out of you.  Can I break for you, baby?  Yeah.  Oh, you think you can.  We're going to use duct tape.  Rick, all right, we're going to take a break.  You've got to get pictures of her as a mummy, and the only parts that are exposed are the 
[01:15:30]  you-know-what parts, okay?  Oh, the vitals?  Yeah.  The parts that are needed.  Erotic mummy returns.  Erotic mummy returns.  And instead of the rock being in the movies, we'll be in everyone's pants.  All right.  Anything else?  Is it true, Erotic Lion King coming out?  Yeah, it's a Disney classic.  It's a Disney classic starring Michael Jackson.  Dude, the picture off, this girl's effing smoking.  Take note, I dumped myself from Robin Purchase. 
[01:16:00]  Very nice.  Look at that.  People dumping stuff on themselves.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Rick, you got a cell phone?  Yes.  Oh.  And talk to the fine lady for a minute.  I got an idea.  All right.  There's something we could do.  All right.  Go ahead.  And go converse over there on the side.  And how did you get started in this at such a young age?  I peg you at, what, 22?  Yeah?  You're so wrong, but thank you.  I love you.  Really?  Because you said you've been listening since you were in high school.  Oh, AAF days up in Boston. 
[01:16:30]  So that could be six years at 24.  Really?  No, but I'm still not telling you.  You're close enough.  Close enough?  What, how old are you?  Yeah.  She said she's listening since high school, and then I was thinking of fear for three years.  But I'm really good at doing that mask.  I could guess your age.  I'm not going to tell you when you do that mask.  But I'm really good.  Okay.  Can I see your taint?  That's how you tell, though.  No, you have to get naked.  Don't you look at peace to tell?  No, the taint. 
[01:17:00]  How do you tell from a taint?  You trust me.  I have rings of a tree.  I will tell your age by your taint.  No.  Yeah.  You have to get naked first.  You're just swinging around like this.  It's like you're doing some beads.  Swinging around.  You've got to swing around.  I get worked up a little for her.  She doesn't want to know, you know, she doesn't want us guessing her age.  That's okay.  Guaranteed, if I saw your taint.  That you could have.  Oh, yeah.  Never been wrong.  What do you guys got up your sleeve? 
[01:17:30]  I know exactly how old you are.  You'd be older than 24.  Yes, don't you?  I'm just thinking from high, unless you were left back 12 times.  Anthony, it's Massachusetts.  Oh, Jesus.  I forgot.  Hey, Rick, yeah, could you follow Rick for a second?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  That's the idea.  All right, well, what's up?  I can't say what's up, Anthony.  It's a cell phone involved. 
[01:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  All right.  Just talk to us.  You don't have to say what you're doing or anything.  All right.  We're just strolling down the hall.  Down the hall.  I can't figure this out.  And walking down the hall.  Are you going to hit with a shovel?  No.  Not yet.  And we're just walking down the hall.  Cell phone, Rick.  Casual stroll.  Checking out offices, seeing who's working today. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, Ken.  There's a run of Fez office.  Here's a radio chick's office.  And who's located right over there?  I'm Steven.  I'm Steven.  Hello, Ken.  The guys would like to say hello.  He's checking his messages.  His messages. 
[01:19:00]  Ken?  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have her sit on that couch there.  It'll make him perk up.  Yeah.  Okay.  There she goes.  That couch's seeing a lot of action.  Rick, what's Ken doing?  Ken's checking his messages.  Oh, wait.  Ben's here.  Ben, what's up?  Ben.  I don't know if Ken might be.  What's wrong?  Sometimes it's cool.  He's giving a kind of a dirty look, and they shot the video camera.  Oh, they have to go on.  We can't put him on video. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, we don't want any evidence.  You know how every show is around because we have a staff party tonight?  Like, the whole hallways, just people pouring out.  I was like, holy crap.  All right.  Well, it didn't work too well.  Rick?  Yeah.  Have Angel with her on the couch.  I know.  It worked for me.  Got that, got that.  Well, unfortunately, now Ken's making a call, so.  Oh, no.  I would, I would, I would bail.  So, yeah, we've decided to pull the plug on this, this idea.  All right.  Oh, no.  We're coming back. 
[01:20:00]  Worth a try.  Hi, Melissa.  They just brought in a girl.  It's really hot.  I'm kind of worked up.  So, can you meet me tonight?  But, wow, what a surprise.  Pete is back out here.  Yeah.  All right.  There's the, the, the girls' pictures are up on www.com.  Oh, no.  Thank you, Rick.  I'm in trouble.  Ken, what's up?  What happened?  I thought he liked that.  You know, he usually does.  He just gave a look like of horror.  Maybe he was feeling fun.  I don't know why, because we don't have to film every single thing we do around here. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Steve is getting, like, slap happy with that camera.  Hey, slap happy.  He really is, though.  Oh, no.  He's got, he's got footage of us just taking a leak that he's going to put up on foundrymusic.com.  Here's all, taking a leak while the commercials play.  Rick, what did he look like?  That was really uncomfortable.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a big boss.  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, you guys want to know when you're going to be in Brill?  Yeah, I see what you're going to say on the screen.  I was wondering this for a while. 
[01:21:00]  What do you know?  Well, Joe's not my name, but I was doing work in their office today, and I asked them.  Oh, yeah.  They're combining Brill, media, and content, and basically flushing everything they've done.  Yeah, because our interview in Brill should have came out by now.  Yeah, they got nothing on you there.  No one even knows about it.  Really?  Honest to God.  What, are they merging with someone else?  Well, they're basically almost both going under.  Oh.  Geez.  Can you find out about that, Rick, to make sure?  I can actually find out tomorrow and call back.  Yeah, I'm curious, because we were supposed to have an interview in a Brill contest. 
[01:21:30]  Bye-bye.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  Wasn't that our straight jacket photo shoot?  Yeah, it was.  Damn, those will never see the light of day.  We got a really good article coming out in FHM magazine.  Yes.  I can't wait for that one.  When is that one coming out?  And the Brill content article should have been out by now.  A little bit out of the day.  I thought something was up.  Hmm.  Eh, whatever.  Oh, well.  All right, we'll take a break.  Ladies, come on down.  The whipped cream bikini contest continues.  And where are some of the girls?  Oh, I know that we got some ringers that come down whenever we need girls. 
[01:22:00]  We'd love to see this whipped cream lesbian thing with our new friend from the B-movies.  Right.  We're going to wrap her in mummy stuff in a minute or two.  Mummy.  Erotic mummy return.  Rick, you got to get her all wrapped up before we get back and break.  Yeah.  And then somehow we got to get her in the studio.  A lot of paper.  Like completely wrap her up.  You would think you might have to carry her into the studio.  And I make slap happy six.  It's Opie and Anthony's whipped cream bikini contest.

No effing clue.  Oh, my God.  No effing clue.  Precious has no clue where grandma's buried.  No.  That's kind of weird.  And no one has visited the grave since she died a few years back. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, no.  Big overgrown.  Oh, without a doubt.  Weed's everywhere.  Probably can't even see the headstone anymore.  Oh.  Hey, that's how she wanted a bitch.  Holy Jesus.  Whatever.  Precious this.  Oh.  Every other headstone probably has, like, nice little flowers and stuff.  Sure.  All kept fresh.  Nothing.  The old one's taken away.  Brand new one's brought.  The headstone nice and clean.  Nothing.  Nothing. 
[01:24:30]  When the happy family goes to see their loved one at the gravesite, they're probably using  my grandma's tombstone to lean on to have their cigarette break.  Oh, my God.  Leaving all the butts on top of the grave.  Huh.  Hey, thanks for suing Mom 20 years ago, you bitch.  Holy Jesus.  Oh.  What happened?  I got one good grandma.  That's all you need.  What?

[01:27:30]  I don't know.  I think if she called you precious, that might be something in it for you.  Well, she called me precious when I was two.  And then the next time she saw me, when I was like 25.  That was in the hospital room.  There was a little gap there, grandma.  Slight gap.  This is awful.  And she wouldn't have said hi to me, but she was, you know, she was in the hospital bed.  Couldn't walk anymore.  And that was when she was dying.  Yeah, now I'm precious again. 
[01:28:00]  God love you.  And you had to leave.  I'll be out in the car.  Everyone knows the story.  I told my mom, I'll be out in the car.  Instead of being there while she was stopped and dead, you waited in the car.  The last words that grandma heard from me, I think my mom denies this, too.  Yeah.  But it is the truth.  I would tend to believe this story.  I said, Mom, I'll be in the car.  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:28:30]  I'm getting a little chilly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That was the last word she heard from her precious.  I'll be out in the car.  I know my mom, she probably had some nice things to whisper in her ear before she left the room, too.  Oh, no.  I got to ask my mom someday.  I hope you feel the cold grip of Satan as you slip from life.  You bitch.  You think?  Nah, my mom's too nice.  Yeah.  If you didn't go to the car, maybe you could have added in some of those fun little things. 
[01:29:00]  No, I think that would, I think that kind of made its, made its point.  Who's that over your shoulder?  That's the Grim Reaper.  Look at him, he's sick already to just lop your head off.  Oh, God.  That would be horrible, wouldn't it?  Someone's just slipping from life.  Precious.  Precious.  Precious.  Feel the cold grip of death, you bitch.  Oh, my God.  Man, we should get a new, we should do a contest.  Get my grandma's tombstone.  No. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  At least a picture of it.  Someone defiling her, too.  Someone taking a leak on it.  That's horrible.  Oh.  Oh, you're awful.  I have no clue where it is.  Whew.  It's kind of sad, isn't it, Ed?  Yeah.  Pretty sad.  All right.  Feel that bitch fork in your ass.  Did we talk about Pro Flowers?  Yes.  Pro Flowers, perfect for Mother's Day. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  ProFlowers.com.  The wisdom, the wisdom of Opie, of Opie and Ben and Anthony.  Unprotected sex, good.  Cigarettes, very good.  1027 WMW.  The Toadies Possum Kingdom.  Best part of the song right there.  We used to play all these songs.  Yeah.  Make up your mind.  Make up your mind. 
[01:30:30]  It's ONA-212-757-1027.  I just want to put Dave on the line real fast, and we'll get to Mummy Girl in a second.  Dave, what's up?  Oh, what's up?  Hey, man.  Listen, does your family give you a lot of crap about, like, how you feel about the grandmother?  That's kind of a good question.  We don't really talk about it much, but, I mean, all kidding aside, my grandma did a  lot of really crappy things.  Yeah, no, I understand.  I got this cousin, right?  And he's still alive.  And he was a bastard to me when I used to live with him. 
[01:31:00]  Like, my family had to live with my uncle's family for a while.  Yeah.  And he was such a scum that he used to push me around.  And he was, like, 14, 15 years older than me.  Yeah.  Like, my family recently finds out that now he's living, you know, near us or whatever,  and he may come down for a visit.  So I'm like, are you kidding me?  If I ever see him again, I'm going to beat the hell out of him now that I'm older.  Yeah.  Did he abuse you?  Yeah.  Sexually?  He touched me in certain places.  Were your babies with covers?  I was, like, seven years old.  The guy used to, like, throw me into walls and stuff. 
[01:31:30]  He was a real scumbag.  Well, see, I mean, there's no secret.  My mom's side of the family was pretty effed up, you know?  I mean, I talk about this in interviews and stuff.  I am made up.  Like, half of me comes from a really whacked out, crazy existence.  Yeah.  And the other half is as normal as it gets, which makes for quite an interesting life,  I must say.  Quite the teeter-totter.  Yeah, you know, don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  I feel like I don't know when it's going to pop out, because my grandma was a bitch. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  She was a...  I mean, we were all just little kids.  I'm one of seven.  And my grandma would visit from Queens, I think from, like, the Flushing area.  Yeah.  And we would all run and hide.  We were scared endless of this lady.  What did she do that made you scared?  She was just a nasty, nasty bitch that never smiled.  Really?  Just was miserable all the time. 
[01:32:30]  Didn't have many friends that I know of.  Wow.  Would just, like, hang out in her house and flushing by herself.  We'd go there, and it would be like a museum, like that just mothball smell.  There was, like, she lived in one of these brick houses, and in the backyard, she was the only house in that area that didn't have a nice yard and stuff.  It was, like, something out of, like, the Addams family.  Like, it was all overgrown and creepy, and, like, the crows would just hang out in her yard and no one else's.  And we'd have to go over there every once in a while, and the place just stunk, a mothball. 
[01:33:00]  Like old grandma.  Old grandma.  Old grandma smell.  Well, she wasn't that old back then.  You know, we're talking when I was a kid.  My mom was probably, like, I don't know, like late 20s, so she was maybe, like, late 40s.  That's not old.  And then I guess there was problems.  Yeah, I mean, my mom, I mean, you know, I'm opening up without doing jokes here.  I mean, my mom had to make a decision, and she pretty much blew off her own mom, you know, for our happiness.  Because, I mean, the mom would come, you know, this grandma would come over, and it was just, she would yell and scream. 
[01:33:30]  We'd be learning how to, like, answer the phone, and if we picked it up after one ring, she'd scream bloody murder.  Just whacked out crazy crap, man.  I don't know why.  I'm trying to realize the crime of answering on one ring.  I don't know.  And then she treated my, you know, my, I have a half-sister, but, I mean, she's my sister.  Treated her like hell because she wasn't, like, blood-related.  All this crap.  Wow, some issues.  And then, like, yeah, she just kind of went away, and next thing I know, she's in a hospital dying. 
[01:34:00]  And so I'm like, F, you go, go to hell, man.  You know?  Wow.  She was very well off, and we were struggling as a family, and, you know, she could care less.  I ended up, I mean, I got stories, man.  She sued my mom.  I mean, it's insane.  How do you sue your kid?  How do you sue your own kid?  She did it.  That's pretty brutal.  She did it.  I remember as a kid, like, my mom getting off the phone crying and stuff because there's lawyers on the phone representing her own mom. 
[01:34:30]  Wow.  All right.  Well, I guess it's a justified hatred.  Well, because I don't want to sound like a, you know, I love, I love joking about it.  I love, like, but now you understand where it's coming from.  This lady is, like, you know, never really knew her, don't want to know her, don't ask questions, don't know, don't want to know where she's buried.  I'm afraid I could care less.  Okay, terrific.  Wow.  What are you going to do, though?  That's brutal.  You know, my mom made a decision that, you know what, I think I have to blow off my own mom for the, you know, for the happiness of my own kids. 
[01:35:00]  And the grandma's like, whatever, no big deal to me, I don't care.  Surprised she even went when she was in the hospital.  Yeah.  Well, I guess you get a little soft spot when your own mom's dying.  Try to make some peace.  After a stroke, and, you know, she's talking out of half her mouth and stuff.  Yeah.  For sure.  And then there's, like, and then, like, my mom had a sister.  And I wish I could get my mom on the air to talk about this stuff. 
[01:35:30]  I guess the sister was, like, kind of down the hall peaking because my mom hasn't seen her own sister in many, many years.  And this lady was all paranoid that, you know, that my mom's making up with her own mom and, you know, she's going to inherit the house and all this stuff.  Was there jockeying for who was going to get stuff?  Because that always happens, especially when there's problems.  My mom, not on my mom's side.  She was just doing the right thing.  Hey, my mom's dying.  I'll see you in the hospital.  The other one was all paranoid.  She's going to lose a payday.  Because a lot of times when an elderly relative is dying, even if you're like, you know, I don't care. 
[01:36:00]  You know, whatever happens, happens.  And there's always one person in the family that will start hoarding or get a little closer to the person toward the end.  You know, all of a sudden they're the ones doing all the favors.  Right.  And they're the ones that, you know, oh, you need a ride or this, that, or the other thing just to get in good.  Right.  And try to get the payday at the end.  And even if you don't care, you still would like maybe sentimental things or an equal cut, let's say. 
[01:36:30]  Just something.  And these people are like, no, I'll get everything.  And I usually rip some families apart.  Supposedly she died a very rich woman.  Where'd it go?  You don't know?  The other sister, I guess, that I haven't seen.  Wow.  She used to be a New York City cop.  And who knows?  There might be a will somewhere that says you're entitled to it.  But it's not even about, who cares?  Yeah.  You know?  Despite the dead woman grabbing some of her wealth.  Yeah.  I'm sure my mom could have fought it or whatever, but, you know, it wasn't about that.  By like, you know, $500,000 worth of bubble gum. 
[01:37:00]  Dude, I have a spider.  I have a whole side of my, one side of my family I don't know anything about.  And then the other side, we're so close.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Like, we have tons of cousins.  We all get together for the holidays, blah, blah, blah.  Other side, I have relatives I don't think I've ever met.  When we were in Massachusetts, one of them lived right there in Lowell.  I remember, you say, hey, I got a relative living there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you drop in?  No.  No, I never met him or anything.  Don't care.  Don't know anything about that side of the family.  No clue. 
[01:37:30]  No effing clue.  They haven't tried to contact you?  Hey, oh.  Five bucks?  Not making enough money yet.  You watch.  Don't come out of the woodwork.  Bastards.  Sunday boy!  All right.  Enough of that, whatever.  That's, like, real-life crap.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Hey, we got, like, what was her name again?  I forgot her name.  Darian.  Darian.  Darian.  Watch, I'm like a lizard. 
[01:38:00]  Wait, can we get Rodney Dangerfield in here for this?  Who?  Rodney doesn't want to commit?  Darian.  Darian.  Hey, mommy.  Do you guys got to watch this?  I like this.  Oh, she's shaking her butt.  All right.  Her ass is hanging out of the mummy costume.  Darian is the bee movie queen or whatever.  A lot of erotic bee movies.  And we met her today.  She's really cool.  And why is she wrapped up like a mummy again?  I forgot.  We thought it would be funny, right? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, it's definitely funny with your boobs, like, sticking out.  Yes, Ben?  Rodney's doing some IDs.  How's this?  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, because she does all these bee movies and she does the horror movies.  So we figured, wrap her up like a mummy.  But amazingly enough, there are holes right where her nippies are.  And, oh, one down there.  Sir Rick.  Very nice.  Big Chris.  Yo, what's up, though?  What's up?  Listen, now, don't get upset, okay?  Yeah.  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  I'm one of seven. 
[01:39:00]  Why?  Your mom must be a goer, huh?  She's Catholic.  Yeah, she's a goer.  Hey, my mom was a goer.  Shut up.  Hey, we didn't bring your mother into this, Anthony.  Take it easy.  Hey, wait a minute.  Shake up and down.  Look at this, though.  Yeah, but you've got to cut out her boobs more.  Yeah, so we have to.  She's a mummy, and we're trying to just cut out the important part.  I put around my boobs so they wiggle.  Yes.  Stinky, yeah.  Stinky is, oh, look at that.  Yeah, just her nips were hanging out.  Yeah, do the whole boobs.  Then I can shake them around.  Yeah.  Not too much, though, Stinky. 
[01:39:30]  You guys have to take pictures of this, because I can't see, and this is funny.  Yeah, we can see your mouth.  We can see your lovely C's.  Yeah, we can see your tongue out.  Yeah, we can see the tongue sticking out of the mummy thing.  It's wrapped up pretty good.  These pictures will be up on NEW.com very shortly, so don't worry.  Yeah.  Oh.  Ronnie's doing, uh...  Are you excusing me?  Doing promo.  I want him to see this.  Hey, uh, Ben, make sure Ronnie didn't, uh, you know, drop dead.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:40:00]  There you go.  Look at how they jiggle.  Watch them wiggle.  Oh, wait.  What's, uh, showing down below there?  Could you back up a little bit?  I can't even look.  Oh, oh, oh, look at that.  Look at that.  I don't know.  I can try to back up.  Yeah, back up.  Don't fall down, though.  Tell me how far back I can go.  Man, we could do things to you, and you wouldn't even be able to, uh, I thought someone just  grabbed her.  You know, we could do stuff to her, and she wouldn't be able to identify us.  Hey, now. 
[01:40:30]  All right, so, uh, are you getting pictures of this, Rick?  Of course.  All right.  I'm eating my hair.  I just want to see what...  I don't think Rodney's done many, uh, radio interviews that have things like this going  on.  Hey, Carol.  Yes.  What's going on, Carol?  Hey, I want to know how I could win my Harley Davidson.  Well, what station are you listening to?  W, W.  Well, we're not giving away Harleys.  Carol.  Hello?  Yes, hi.  We're not giving away Harleys. 
[01:41:00]  Yes, you are.  Aren't you doing it for the month of May?  Month of May.  Month of May, Harley?  No.  Oh, come on, guys.  Another radio station.  I think you're confused.  No, I haven't changed my radio station all day long.  Okay.  All right, bye.  Bye.  I hope she was going to say the wrong station.  I know.  Have fun with her.  All right, we're waiting for Rodney.  Is he all right, Ben?  What is he doing?  He's really eating my hair.  Huh.  All right, could you hold through the break, mommy girl?  Yeah, but I'm eating my hair. 
[01:41:30]  I see that.  Yeah, look at her hair.  I'm like eating my hair.  Yeah.  It's so good.  Well, no, thank you.  Oh, my God.  No one can, she can't see.  Thank you.  She can't.  Yeah.  Go.  Hold on.  We had to talk about twice.  A-hole.  A-hole.  There you go.  You don't know who felt you up, though.  Yeah, anybody felt me up.  Here comes Rodney.  Could be anybody.  Rodney Dangerfield, comedy legend. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, she just hit her head on the mic.  Comedy legend, Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, Rodney.  What's up, man?  Let Rodney through, mommy girl.  What a read on you.  Hey, Rodney, what's going on?  How are you doing?  I'm hanging in my phone, man.  Is this on or what?  Oh, yeah.  That's on.  You're on.  This place is getting freaker and freaky.  Isn't it insane?  That's why he came back.  This is Darian.  She's a B-movie actress, and she does a lot of those erotic horror movies. 
[01:42:30]  We do.  All right.  So we figured we'd dress.  Let me tell you a B.  What?  Let me tell you a B.  Yeah.  We figured we'd dress her up like a mummy.  I have no problems, okay?  We dress her up like a mummy.  She looks good, huh?  Yeah, that's very nice.  All the best parts are cut out, too.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do your parents know about this?  Yeah.  They do?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Hey, you can't see him, but say hi to Rodney Dangerfield.  All right, baby.  We said hello already.  Yeah.  I said hello to both of them. 
[01:43:00]  Hey.  Yeah.  Rodney, would you like to?  She won't know.  Yes, I will.  I'll kick him in the nuts.  No, you can't kick Rodney in the nuts.  Don't kick Rodney in the nuts.  That's class.  We come from Connecticut.  Massachusetts.  He met him.  Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  I remember that show went up there at a good time.  Martha showed me her vineyard.  Listen, I got trouble today.  Last night, the first time I tried the agri, you know.  By agri?  You tried that last night?  Yeah.  I still was strong. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, I sprained my wrist, you know.  Then accidentally, I dropped a whole bottle of agri in the toilet.  Now the lid won't stay down.  That's what I'm doing here.  Rodney, Dangerfield.  Yeah.  Back again.  Thanks for coming back in.  I'm back again to tell the people that I'm appearing Wednesday, right?  Yeah.  On the May 9th.  I'm sticking to my mind.  At Avery Fisher Hall in the Lincoln Center here in New York.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, well, I'm out. 
[01:44:00]  So, I got competition here.  It's like tough, you know.  Yeah, well, nude girl usually wins out, but you're a comedy legend, so.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, we usually just say again.  I can tell you, boy, this is a great show to be on, you know.  Of course.  You're going to be a legend.  Sure.  You want to write that down, perhaps?  Comedy legend.  Good day, I mean.  You got a good day?  Yeah.  Got a dial tone.  Hey, you want her to break out of the mummy thing, and then she can leave the studio,  and then we can concentrate on Rodney Dangerfield for a little while?  Yes, I think, you know.  All right, why don't you break out of the mummy thing? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Now you can see what she looks like.  That's nice, Rodney, huh?  Are you reading your toilet paper?  Why don't you ever run out?  Whoa, look at how she gets out of that.  She squirms like a snake.  Rodney, nice surprise, right?  What do you think?  What do you think?  Absolutely. 
[01:45:00]  She had a hell of a piss.  Yeah, she's got a hell of a piss.  Do you like that?  Do you prefer the mohawk haircut down in the most intimate of areas, as opposed to the  big, a lot of hair thing, Rodney?  What do you think down there?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I think we have to jump out of that.  That's nice.  All right, Rodney's taking a look at you there.  Could you show him?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Rodney, take a look at that.  Right?  Very lovely girl.  What do you think?  Very lovely girl.  Sure.  How long have you been in therapy? 
[01:45:30]  Two months.  Two months.  Yeah, that was good.  But she's in movies.  My psychiatrist, I feel like I'm nothing all the time, you know?  He told me, don't worry about it.  He's not worth anything.  I don't know.  Anyway, what do I tell you?  All right, we're going to take a break, and we're going to hang with Rodney for a while.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks, Darian.  That's good, right?  Right, Rodney?  That's good stuff.  That's nice, right?  That's good stuff.

[01:51:00]  it happens, okay?  Email me.  Hey, he's not kidding.  I'm on your website, rodney.com.  Yeah?  He said, I'm not kidding you.  It has the joke of the day.  Joke of the day.  That's a big one.  You don't want to hear the joke of the day, yeah.  Do you have a joke of the day for us?  Well, I mean, you're live.  Why go to the website?  We got Rodney right here.  The joke of the day?  Yeah.  I'm not with a belly dancer.  She told me I'd turn her stomach.  It's a joke of the day.  What do I know?  Hey, did you like the limo ride in today?  The limo?  Thanks.  I mean, you know, when I ride 15 minutes, they give me a limo. 
[01:51:30]  The long ones, I got a pickup truck usually, you know?  But anyway, what else am I going to say to you about that?  Well, we just got to thank Victory Limousine for bringing Rodney over.  6-3-1 Victory.  You got something worked out with them, I see.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  We keep it under the table, you know?  You know?  They take care of us.  But everybody today, I know this is how I'm a kid.  Today, people love sports more than ever, you know what I mean?  Everyone's into sports.  Right.  And I was a kid, I played football in high school, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, but they kicked me out.  Yeah, I kept falling in love. 
[01:52:00]  I was a quarterback.  I kept falling in love with the center.  What happened to you there, you know?  The one thing I don't think in football, they make a big deal on a two-minute warning.  It's a big deal.  All the players, the way you got two minutes, you know?  To me, a two-minute warning is like you're in bed with a chick.  The phone rings.  It's her husband's car phone.  He says, honey, I'll be home in two minutes.  That's a two-minute warning.  No.  Now, that's good.  That should be joke of the day, I think.  That's a good joke of the day.  Yeah?  Has that ever been joke of the day, that one?  Come and see me every fish in the hall. 
[01:52:30]  It may not.  I'll play some jokes at a night.  Yeah, jokes at a night.  If you want to let your hair down, I mean way down.  Yeah.  I mean, that's it.  Okay, I'll try to...  Do some of the dirty material?  Forget all the stuff I can't do on television.  Really?  Radio.  Oh, I can do it here.  Hey, Rodney, give us one of your dirty jokes.  One of my dirty jokes?  Yeah, they'll dump out.  I don't care.  They'll just bloop it out.  What's the difference?  I mean, I know dirty jokes, man, but I feel funny just telling dirty jokes here, you know?  There's only men here.  Yeah.  Well, you want us to bring the money girl? 
[01:53:00]  We'll bring her back.  The naked girl.  Hey, Rodney, why didn't you do Caddyshack 2?  Why?  Yeah.  That's a strange thing, isn't it?  Yeah, it was my idea to do it.  Then they wrote it, you know?  And I didn't like it.  You didn't like the script for Caddyshack 2?  No.  And so they put another guy in.  Jackie Mason.  And whatever happened, happened.  I wouldn't do it.  I didn't like the script.  I gave up a lot of bread, too.  You don't want me to have to do it.  I guess. 
[01:53:30]  But that was it.  You know what?  Caddyshack 2, one of the worst movies ever made.  I know you're not going to say it, so I'll say it.  I didn't want to do it.  One of the worst movies ever made after that brilliant Caddyshack.  And Caddyshack 1, of course.  Great.  Easy Money, also.  He worked with Pesci.  Yeah, Joe Pesci.  He's got to be a scream, huh?  To work with, sure.  Well, I like Joe.  He had a good time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just going to finish another one called The Fourth Tenor.  The Fourth Tenor?  He'll be out in almost three or four months. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I mean, just finish it.  And I like that one.  I'm so excited about that.  Who's in that?  Who's in that?  Let me see.  Robert Darby.  You know him?  No.  Okay.  Well, he's, you know, he's in that.  And people, I mean, they're not big, big names when they're here, you know what I mean?  It's a little cute movie.  Yeah.  No Lady Bugs 2?  No.  This movie here, the movie will be released in November, and the director will be released 
[01:54:30]  in December, I believe.  You know what movie they've been showing a lot?  I think we talked to Rodney about it last week, but they showed it all weekend, Back  to School.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Sam.  It's funny, man.  The movies I made, for some reason, Back to School Keeps Going, has legs.  It's like any kid who goes to college wants to see that.  Yeah.  And as long as colleges keep going, they want to see that.  And Golf at the Caddyshack, you know.  Yeah.  Lady Bugs with the soccer, they want to see soccer movies, kids.  I've got people who are eight-year-olds on me, you know, and ten-year-olds me. 
[01:55:00]  They're into me.  That's funny.  It's in the soccer.  Rover Danger, you ever hear of that?  No.  No?  The road is a full-length feature I did for Warner Brothers, and that's, we'll go on  and on.  Okay?  Do you still do the triple indie?  Yes.  Every morning I practice that.  Right, right.  Luckily, I live in a high floor, so I've got room to dive and do it.  Bonghead Bob.  Hey, what's up, Rodney?  Hi, what's up?  Hey, you're my biggest fan, man.  If I told you what's up, man.  Hey, I've been waiting on a hold so long, I forget what my question was. 
[01:55:30]  What do you got for Rodney?  I got a bong hit for Rodney.  Rodney, you want a bong hit?  A bong hit?  A bong.  A bong.  How do you feel about the bong, Rod?  I, well, uh, you speak with, yes, I like the bong.  Not sexually, just I like the bong, though.  I think Rodney would smoke a joint before a bong hit.  I think so.  He's smoking out of a water pipe, Rodney.  He's smoking out of a water pipe.  I've got to be careful.  I asked my doctor.  You know my doctor, Dr. Vinnie Boombat. 
[01:56:00]  Vinnie Boombat.  You know?  Yeah.  I asked if my heart was strong enough for sex.  He told me not if I join in, you know?  So I've got to be careful.  Do you smoke the weed, Rodney?  I've been smoking pot all my life, okay, man?  All my life, all right?  Nothing wrong with that, right?  Well, it is what it is to different people.  With me, it's okay, because I don't drink.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But people sometimes like liquor.  Some guys can have one shot and they're drunk.  Other guys, ten shots, nothing bothers.  The same with pot, man.  Not good for everybody.  I don't advocate it. 
[01:56:30]  It helps in many ways.  It helps your blood pressure.  It helps make you softer.  It does not make you wild or violent.  And I know.  Right.  But anyway, that's the story.  How often do you partake?  Partake in pot?  Yeah.  Whenever I can get some.  Really?  Stinky.  Right now, I'm having a drug problem.  I can't find any pot.  Stinky's our guy.  He always has pot.  Stinky always has pot.  Yeah.  He loves the weed.  Rodney, I'm being dead serious.  You want a joint right now? 
[01:57:00]  What am I going to do with it?  We'll smoke it up right now.  Are you going to smoke it too?  We'll all take a hit.  Take a hit.  Right in here.  Sure.  Pass it around.  Yeah.  All right.  It gets stinky.  It gets stinky.  Roll a dupe.  Go get a joint.  How many times in your life can you say you smoked a dupe with Rodney Dangerfield?  Right?  Right.  Rodney, look at Rodney.  Why not?  Right?  Listen, I don't want you to think that I'm square or anything.  You're not square.  You're not square.  Square? 
[01:57:30]  I can tell.  You're not square.  You're a hep cat.  Lisa wants to say hi on the phone.  Sure.  Please, Lisa?  We're going to get high with Rodney in a minute here.  Lisa, what's up?  Nothing, Rodney.  I just want to tell you that you're awesome and I saw you on Sunday night and you're great  and I love you.  Well, thank you so much, honey.  Do you live alone?  No, I'm married.  Oh, you're married.  All right.  But you know what?  Tell your husband to call me.  Tell your husband to call me.  I go 18 ways.  All right.  All right, Lisa.  Thanks.  All right.  Hey, why don't you, Rodney, smell what the stinks packing there. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, there we go.  Tell us what you think.  In the baggie.  Do you have any rolled?  Of course, this is all just for the radio, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Take a gander at that.  Tell us what you honestly think.  I just smelled it, man.  I'm stoned.  You got it, will you?  You think he's got the good stuff?  There's not one freaking girl here for Christ's sake.  Hey, I think that B movie star, Rod, she got it.  Take a hit, man. 
[01:58:30]  Take a hit.  Smell it.  Smell it, man.  Let me smell that.  Smell it here.  Let me smell it, Rodney.  I guarantee you'll be whacked, okay?  Let me smell some of that.  Make sure Rodney doesn't walk out with a baggie.  This is boring.  That could be a good stuff.  Wait, wait, wait, Rodney.  It's not effing orgy, Bob.  You got to watch the F word and the S word.  S word and S word.  Yeah.  You got to leave out full and saved.  Hey, Moose, Rocco. 
[01:59:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Hey, Mommy Girl, do you smoke the weed?  Yeah.  You like smoking the pot?  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anything else?  No.  You just like weed?  Sometimes.  Little E?  No.  Or X?  Hate it.  Yeah?  Wow.  I think you'd be one of those party girls.  How about a beer?  No, I used to be.  How about a beer?  I think it's a beer.  You want a beer?  You got your beer.  Hey, uh, so you want to, uh, you know, the, uh, and, uh, we'll take it and then we'll, 
[01:59:30]  yeah, okay.  Eat a calzone.  Rodney, we're dead serious.  Right now, there's one girl here.  She can make approximately a thousand bucks, you know?  The hard way.  That includes the entire building.  So, Rod, uh, you're going to be back in the limousine after this interview?  I'm going back in the limousine, yeah.  You got a long ride and stuff?  Well, it's, uh, one of the little place I'm staying in, it's a boarding house.  A boarding house?  Boarding house.  Well, they're friends for years.  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, man. 
[02:00:00]  All right?  I'm thinking you, we should put them up somewhere, uh, nice.  One of the luxury hotels here in Midtown.  You're thinking you're going to look to a boarding house.  Hey, we're going to set you up nice.  That boarding house is going to look like a five-star hotel in about 15 minutes.  You can get done with the limit.  If I take a hit of this.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  I feel like I'm living.  Thank you.  You know, that's what people say.  People, they say they go out in their boat.  Yeah.  They say the boat is very relaxing.  Yeah.  They go out in the water is relaxing.  They go out in their boat, they get drunk, and they say, oh, the water is... 
[02:00:30]  They can take a bottle of booze to a furnished room, get drunk, and say, oh, the furnished  room is so relaxing.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as you're drunk.  It's the booze that's relaxing, not the boat.  But I had trouble when I was in the submarine duty, you know?  Submarine?  You can't kick me out of there, too.  I like to sleep with the windows open.  Yeah.  Hey, Ann, I have a feeling we're going to be smoking pot with Rodney in a couple of minutes.  Well, why not?  Right?  On your next break. 
[02:01:00]  How is that?  Yeah.  Sounds good.  That does sound good.  All right.  Rodney Dangerfield, he's playing Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday, May 9th.  Some tickets still available.  Matter of fact, why don't we give away a pair of tickets, or how many?  A couple of pairs of tickets to see Rodney Dangerfield to two random callers, 212-757-1027.  We'll be back.

Because I had the best time in Las Vegas.  Even though my wife and her mother were there.  I'm a little hoarse now, you know.  I see that.  Yeah.  But I want to say...  I learned one thing today, Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Rodney doesn't share.  Rodney's Bogart in the doobie.  Right.  Hey, Rodney, what do you think of the black guy?  The black guy?  What do you think of a black guy?  I'm glad he's here.  Now, my hubcaps are all right.  No, that's the Puerto Rican.  I tell you, I wish I was black, you know.  Yeah?  Yeah, from here down.  I'm not going to run along.

This is messed up.  Rodney's outside the studio kind of just making phone calls now.  Ben, go check on him.  Make sure he's all right.  Who's he calling?  He's calling the dealer.  Hey, I need more weed.  Stinky, give me your number.  Oh, my God. 
[02:07:00]  Deb the Dyke.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Deb.  Hey.  Hey.  I was wondering, I noticed that, Oop, you, uh, refrained from taking the hill for that  joint.  I was wondering if you were afraid Rodney has some kind of disease.  Well, that would be highly illegal.  Oh, highly illegal.  I guess officially I'm, like, uh, in control of the buttons, the designated driver.  I'm the designated radio host.  Well, I hope they don't have you guys on the dump button, too.  That would be big trouble. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  That's right.  Can't have that.  See you.  Oh, great and happy birthday.  Thank you.  All right, Deb.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Deb the Dyke.  We love Deb the Dyke.  Kind of dykey looking, but in a cute way.  There you go.  That's one way to put it.  Was that a compliment?  Sped by me so fast, I couldn't quite see it.  Well, yeah.

He is smooth. 
[02:08:30]  Is he all right, Ben?  He's just kind of walking away.  He's yakking up a storm on the phone.  I didn't want to interrupt him.  I don't want to say.  All right.  Sorry, Ed.

So, Rodney Dangerfield kind of just wandered on out of here. 
[02:10:00]  He just started staggering down the hall.  Is he all right?  Is he back in his limousine, Rick?  Yeah.  Huh?  I kind of just put him on an elevator with, like, a bunch of different people.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he left the studio, made a few phone calls, and then kind of staggered down the hall.  Yeah, thank you.  He's out of here.  I'm going to go, guys, okay?  Yeah.  That's what he did.  He was just sitting there all the time.  Hey, I'm going to go.  I'm a pretty stoned.  God love him, man. 
[02:10:30]  He's going to be 80 in November.  He's got free pot.  He's like, that's it.  I'm out.  He likes the weed.  We looked up his birth date the other day.  Yeah.  And it was 1921.  Wow.  Best line.  One of the best lines ever on our show got dumped out of him, fortunately.  I don't even think they had to dump it, but.  Yeah, I know.  So, Rick's going to find the line, and we'll replay it later or tomorrow.  But, basically, Rodney Dangerfield saying, hey.  Well, I can't do the Rodney voice.  He's having the, he was like, hey, this is a glitch. 
[02:11:00]  You know, with the IT part.  Mark from East Cloud, you killed Rodney.  You bastard.  No, he was fine.  Well, Rodney pretty much admitted that marijuana's been a part of his life for, like, 50-some-odd years.  I think he said 55 years.  55 years.  Smoking the weed for 55 years.  He used to pick up 10-finger lids for a nickel.  Imagine buying a pot, like, 55 years ago. 
[02:11:30]  But that must have been, like, probably, like, cop and heroin.  Like, what, 1946, if I did my math quickly enough?  The evil's a brief of madness.  That was during the time when you thought you smoked pot.  You thought hacking chicks up with axes.  No, you jumped out windows.  Jumped out windows.  This is a pot.  I can fly, man.  Groovy.  Hey, sure, you start with marijuana, then Benny's, Dexie's, meth.  All right, Officer Friday.  Smoke a joint.  Next thing you know, your baby's drowning in a bathtub. 
[02:12:00]  What?  That was one of the episodes.  They didn't say that, did they?  It was one of the episodes of Dragnet, the original Dragnet, with Jack Webb.  He walks into a house.  He got a call.  And the mother of this baby is sitting there going, hey, man.  You know, it's like, where's your baby?  Where's your baby?  And she goes, he's in the bathtub, man.  Don't hassle me, pig.  You know, all the cliches of the 60s.  What was playing in the background?  Jefferson Airplane or something?  Yeah, some kind of groovy mood music. 
[02:12:30]  I don't know.  And then they walk in, and you hear, you know, the music.  And it's just Friday, and his little sidekick there, Harry Potter.  Harry Morgan.  Harry Potter.  Yeah.  Colonel Potter.  Harry Morgan.  Harry Potter.  Right.  Hey, come on.  That was a good pie.  And they're just staring into the bathtub, shaking their head.  And the mother comes staggering in.  Hey, man.  What?  What?  And screams.  Sure.  Smoke a joint. 
[02:13:00]  Kill a baby.  You pretty much said that.  You smoke pot, you'll kill your baby.  Hey, I saw the spot where Jack Webb died of a massive coronary.  You saw that on the Hollywood death tour?  Yeah.  We've got to get that guy in the air.  Didn't we have a mom when we first came to New York?  Hey, I'm a coming attraction.  No, we did the New York guy.  The New York guy sucked.  But the L.A. trip.  Graveyard.  Graveyard.  Graveline tours.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know what, Rick?  I know where I got that from. 
[02:13:30]  There's a tour in L.A.  We talk about it from time to time where they show you where people died and crime scenes  and that.  Like, you get to see where Charles Manson's people did their thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you see where Fred Mertz dropped out of a heart attack coming out of a movie  theater, a movie premiere.  That's right, Rick.  Right on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  Jack Webb in the lobby, I believe, of a hotel or an apartment complex.  They show you where Marilyn Monroe's body was.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  And then you're in a hearse for the whole tour, and all the locals in Beverly Hills, they  give you the finger because they hate this guy and they hate his tour.  Well, he's making money off of the death of the people in Hollywood.  Right.  So, we're on the tour.  This goes back, obviously, five, six years ago.  And also, we're outside this house.  And we're like, everyone's like, well, who died here or whatever?  And like, oh, no, this is just a coming attraction.  This is George Burns' house.  Yeah.  Swear to you.  We were laughing so effing hard. 
[02:14:30]  Get out of here.  I just fell down in the bathtub last week.  My pelvis is broken.  I could go at any time.  And he did.  It was like a couple weeks later.  The guy was dead.  Coming attraction.  You can't break those hips, old people.  Old people got to watch that.  Stay away from the broken hips.  It's always downhill after that.  That's what I smoked a pub.  Roddy might have broken hip after this.  I hope not.  Geez.  Can we call Victory Limousine to make sure he's back in the limo? 
[02:15:00]  Now I feel like a responsible person.  Make sure he, uh...  You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't like, you know, let the celebrities leave stoned.  He's fine.  He's better off now than when he came in.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen A?  Hey.  Uh, Jack Webb's partner on the show is Joe Gannon.  Oh, Joe Gannon.  Joe Gannon.  He said more words in one match episode than he ever said on, on Drag Race.  Oh, I know.  He barely said anything.  He used to just look at Joe Friday and, uh, shake his head. 
[02:15:30]  That was a great episode when he caught those, those two hippies all potted up, man.  Yeah.  But my favorite was the guy that painted himself blue.  Blue boy.  It was beautiful, but they didn't have X back then.  How did he do that?  He was like, I could fly and I'm a tree or something.  He's like, he's totally out there.  It was the angel dust, right?  I don't even think it was angel dust back then.  I think he was doing the H.  It was heroin.  It was on the H.  It was the Heron.  Heron.  And he'd have all the terms for it, but they were like 10 years dated.  Horse.  Horse.  The big H. 
[02:16:00]  Big H.  All right, John, thank you.  Thanks, fellas.  Oh, was it Joe Gannon?  Because it was Joe Friday, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was Joe Friday.  They were both Joe?  No, they wouldn't be both.  What?  No, I don't know.  Frank Gannon?  Frank Gannon.  Someone will get it.  Yeah, someone will get it.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, two weeks ago or three weeks ago, when you were ripping on this same thing, you started  talking about the Mannix episode, where a girl thought she could fly.  Yeah.  She teetered on the top of the building and fell off.  I was six years old. 
[02:16:30]  That was the first death I ever saw on television.  And I laughed my ass off.  You laughed?  She's like, I can fly.  I can fly.  And then you see, like, in slow motion, no!  And she fell and floated like a feather and hit the pavement, and then you saw the crowd  came around her.  Yeah, they didn't show much back then on TV.  Yeah, that was always a big thing.  It was Officer Bill Gannon.  Bill Gannon?  In that movie, Database.  And Tom had it on line three. 
[02:17:00]  Thanks, Tom.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Hey, I got to know, I got an Angel Dutch story for you.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right?  I was an EMT in, like, 1986, and I was still in an ambulance standby for Judas Priest concert.  Okay?  Yeah.  And this guy thought he was God.  Okay?  All he kept repeating over and over, holy S, I'm God.  And we had to strap him down to the stretcher. 
[02:17:30]  And, you know, one guy's going, you know, don't turn on the sirens.  You're going to make him freak out.  Of course, the wise-ass driver.  Woo, woo, woo!  Guy completely freaked out.  Bring him to the hospital.  There's, like, 80 guards waiting with Billy Colton.  And he starts coming off the dust.  He's like, hey, man, what's going on?  They just tied him to a stretcher and brought him in.  Fun with Angel Dust.  Very good.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Later.  That's what freaks me out.  Yeah.  What if Jesus was just, like, you know, a dope fiend?  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:00]  We're banking on this Jesus guy.  Maybe he was just a lunatic that was on the dope.  And he was the son of God and stuff.  And all of his disciples on the dope and thinking they're seeing miracles and stuff.  Could happen.  Maybe they had really good stuff.  That scares me, yeah.  Interesting.  Everyone remembers.  Ladies and gentlemen, the story you're about to see is true.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent. 
[02:18:30]  Hello.  This is such an adult show.  When this was on, I was just into cartoons.  I'd hear that music pick up.  It's blows.  Is this another Quinn Martin production?  Oh, it might have been.  You know what was always scary at the end?  When they would take that big hammer, that guy would come out, the arm, and you'd see the hammer.  And he'd grab the Mark 7, I think it was on the metal plate, and bang, hit it. 
[02:19:00]  It used to scare me as a kid.  It's like always Blue Boy on the LSD.  I'd be taking LSD.  I'm a tree, and I could fly, man.  Well, I want to thank the ladies for helping us out once again today with the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Girls.  You guys are insane.  We had one lady come in.  Thank God she's hot and everything.  Yeah.  But I guess none of the girls that listen to this show want a chance to go to Hawaii.  We have three days left of qualifying. 
[02:19:30]  So ladies, you just got to get down here tomorrow, Thursday, or Friday, and show off what you got.  We put a Whipped Cream Bikini on you.  Grand prize.  Trip to Hawaii.  Packers, Packers, Packers.  Courtesy of Contiki Tours and Victory Limousine.  And thank you Whipped Cream Bikini.com for helping us as well.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  By the way, speaking of trips, we got the chance to go to L.A. to see the final episode of Survivor when they do the town hall meeting.  Yeah.  Kimmy's hinting that she's going to try to do something for the show in front of like 60 million people.  I don't know.  She doesn't disappoint. 
[02:20:00]  But that's kind of a tough order.  You know what?  I don't doubt her anymore.  Really?  I've been the doubter with Kimmy.  I said, no way will she do what's in my pants.  No way will she come in here and flash us.  No way will she get naked.  She's done it all.  Mm-hmm.  If she can, she's going to fit it in.  I'm telling you.  I don't think she's got fear of CBS, which is good.  You know, most people would be like, oh, I don't want to get in trouble with it.  And she doesn't care.  So, I mean, she might do something.  Looking forward to it.  If Brian Gumbel, though, asks her, you know, what have you been up to since Survivor, then  she's got some good answers for that, thanks to the program. 
[02:20:30]  He'll probably try to squash it just because he's such a stick in the mud.  Yeah, we'll see.  We'll see.  But you could be in L.A.  You had to be watching CBS this morning, their new show.  In the 6 a.m. hour, Ant and I did a quick video clip.  I haven't even seen the video clip yet.  Uh-oh.  You'll play it for us, and then we'll ask a question if you got the answer to what we were doing this morning.  You'll be qualified for the trip to L.A.  We're going to do that in like a half hour.  Louis Black coming in as well very, very soon.  Who's been on hold all day? 
[02:21:00]  Uh, Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, the show sounds a lot better when you're stoned.  When we smoke in the pot.  Hey, you know, Rodney.  Rodney had the joint the whole time.  Hey, Rodney, you guys too, man.  It's pretty funny.  All right, take it easy, guys.  All right, Andrew.  I like the smoke, you know.  Hey, guys.  This guy's been on hold for like an hour and a half.  Pete?  Yeah, I have.  Yeah, I'm at my day job right now anyway, actually.  But I wanted to tell you here in New York and more than 130 other cities, we're having a march to legalize, decriminalize, or medicalize herb. 
[02:21:30]  And here in New York, you guys, of course, would be welcome to come speak if you're honestly for the cause as opposed to just being cool on the radio with it.  No offense.  You know what?  I'll tell you, Pete.  I don't smoke the wacky tobacco.  Well, that's fine.  That's fine.  And I appreciate honesty.  But the purpose of the march is not to get it legal for us for regular usage. 
[02:22:00]  The purpose is for medical usage because it helps people with glaucoma.  All right.  We know.  No, we don't want marijuana Barbie to tell us all this stuff.  She wants that on the show, by the way.  Yeah, I work with her, actually.  Do you guys honestly think marijuana is going to be legalized, though?  I think if it ever becomes where the people ourselves, we get to vote on it as opposed to the legislators.  It's never going to happen, though.  It happened in, it was up for election this year in Alaska.  They had the opportunity, but the legislator wrote it so that it was proactive, that everyone who was in jail for it would have gotten out that day. 
[02:22:30]  I think if that clause wasn't in there, I think it would have been made legal in Alaska this year.  All right, Pete, you're boring people.  Give the details of your march.  Okay.  2001, the spaceodicy.com shows all 130 cities that are having it.  And here in New York, we're meeting at Washington Square Park, and then we move down, walk from there, all the way down to Battery Park.  Take the perfect place.  All right, Pete.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man. 
[02:23:00]  See you there.  We've got to get this quote from Dragnet.  Here's Joe Friday.  Yeah.  Now you listen to me, you guttermouth punk.  I've dealt with you before, and every time I did, it took me a month to wash off the filth.  I'll tell you what you did to that four-year-old girl out in Westlake.  You stalked her out.  Out on a bench, like you always done.  You brought a sack of penny candy.  You waited until the right little girl came along.  You got her in your car.  She started to cry, and you hit her across the mouth twice.  You cut her lip with your ring.  Knocked out three of her teeth.  And then you know what you did to her.  No, I didn't say that, Rockwell.  You did. 
[02:23:30]  That's exactly what you told those officers who arrested you.  They advised you of your constitutional right before you opened your mouth.  Now you're trying to say you didn't understand?  Well, you're a liar.  Like every hoodlum, hoodlum since Kane up through Capone.  You've learned to hide behind some quirk in the law.  And mister, you're a two-bit hoodlum.  You've fallen twice for ADW burglary three times, twice for forcible rape.  I tagged you for those.  And now you've graduated.  You've moved to the sewer.  You're a child molester.  Fine at that quote.  You know what that must have been like, seeing him say that?  Oh, just like you said it. 
[02:24:00]  I gotta see that clip.  Denise?  Yeah.  Hey, what up?  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Um, you know, those girls on your whipped cream bikini contest, they are just nasty.  What?  Not all of them.  No, even Kelly looks like white trash Jersey girl.  Kelly is hot.  Is she from Connecticut?  No.  No, she's not.  You know something?  Listen, I don't think you are, um, qualified to say if these girls are hot or not.  I think I am.  Well, then come on down. 
[02:24:30]  No.  It's a trip to Hawaii.  No, but you, you definitely, you have to, I don't know what you have to do, but, I mean,  even, oh, and Opie, you were saying yesterday that Nendy has a pretty face.  No, she doesn't.  Come on.  She was on the phone.  Pretty fat.  She's not only fat, but she's butt ugly.  Wow, Denise.  What's wrong, Denise?  What's the matter?  I'm angry.  Why are you angry, Denise?  All the time.  Why are you angry?  No, I don't, you should have hotter girls on your, I mean, you guys are all being Anthony. 
[02:25:00]  You should be getting hot chicks all the time.  Look, you know something?  Every guy that's looking at pictures of some of these girls, and I'll use your example,  Kelly, is looking going, God damn, that is hot.  So, but you're a girl saying that you're not.  I have many guy friends.  All my guy friends came over last night and we looked at the website.  Denise?  Well, not, and they were all like, oh yeah, they thought Dallas was pretty hot.  All right, Denise, Denise, we like regular, natural girls.  Anyone could call a strip club and have them march through the studio over and over again.  These are our listeners. 
[02:25:30]  They're, they're, they're regular.  They got nice bodies and we're into it.  It's, it's cool.  Yeah, I don't know about all natural.  Oh, that one lady.  Well, there's some breast implants and stuff, whatever.  But, I mean, we could call up all the strip clubs.  We could have a, we could have a whole studio filled with, you know.  No, that wouldn't be, that wouldn't be fun.  But these are girls representing our, our listeners and they want to win a trip to Hawaii.  And I think a lot of them have very nice bodies.  Yeah.  You're insane.  I don't know.  Syndication when you guys find somebody hot.  What are your, let me, let me hear about maybe your bod. 
[02:26:00]  If you, do you consider yourself hot?  Um, I am 5'10", 110 pounds, 112 maybe.  Too skinny.  Wow.  Blonde hair, green eyes.  You've got those long skinny arms.  Lying up my ass.  Ah, there you go.  You're lying?  She's lying.  Yeah, what do you look like?  No, I'm pretty.  I'm, I'm, I'm on the chunky side.  Ah.  So why are you making fun of our girls?  Please, Donald. 
[02:26:30]  She was a whore.  She just hung up on us, too.  She's probably angry because she sees a lot of nice hot bodies on the website.  Oh, the guys that were over.  Either she's chubby and, you know, the guys that hang out with chubby girls, faggots.  So they wouldn't find them hot.  Or she was with guys that just want to get in their pants, so they're like, oh, yeah, that  chick's not as hot as you.  Figure it out.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  This is Flack.  I'm calling from Boston, just to let you know.  Cool.  Syndication underground.  Oh, you know, but hopefully, you know, you guys are talking about the after-school 
[02:27:00]  special where the girl ran out, well, I jumped out of the window on drugs.  Yeah.  That was Helen Hunt when she was younger, man.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I just looked it up on the net for you guys.  I figured it's a cool fact.  You guys could just toss around and maybe see if other celebrities were in these things,  too, you know?  All right.  There's a couple of dyke allegations going down with Helen Hunt.  I don't know, man.  Well, now she's hanging out with Melissa Etheridge.  Melissa Etheridge, and they look like...  Meg Ryan.  Oh.  No, Helen Hunt. 
[02:27:30]  I saw Helen Hunt.  I saw the story with Helen Hunt.  Ellen DeGeneres?  And Melissa Etheridge.  The story I just saw.  And it was, they were kind of looking kind of close.  I don't think Helen Hunt's mainly at all.  Canoodling?  Maybe canoodling.  Just short of canoodling.  A canoodle.  One single canoodle.  Yeah, she doesn't look like she could be a dyke.  All right.  Hey, where's Lewis Black?  Ah, yeah.  Where's Lewis Black?  This is Helen Hunt.  And you guys come down here, because I want to see him. 
[02:28:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  I'll pull up my slog and tell him.  Where's Mr. Black?  I don't know.  I guess he's running late.  All right.  Oh.  We'll take a break.  I'm an award winner now.  I can be late.  So you have to put up with this.  All right.  Wonderful.  Yeah, he's never late.  Remember when he used to come in early?  Just think of the coffee machine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe he met up with Rodney on Rodney's way out.  You don't want to go up there. 
[02:28:30]  With stone.  They're all, they're wrapping women up in duct tape or something.  That's been a pretty weird show.  Mummy Girl and Rodney saying this is good ass.  It's so funny putting Rodney in those situations, too.  Like, he was in the other day with the whipped cream thing going on.  And then he'd walked in today to a girl just wrapped head to toe like a mummy.  Right.  With just her boobs hanging out.  Hey, what am I supposed to say?  Like, he was taking a bath.  Are those pictures up on WNEW.com? 
[02:29:00]  I am.  Let's put them right next to a balloon guy from yesterday.  Hiya, folks.  This is Rodney Dangerfield.  And you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on 1027 WNEW.  And I tell you, these guys are great.  I mean, I heard them all.  And these guys are the best there is.  Oh, will you please now untie me?  Oh, look at that.

[02:31:00]  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Corn got to life.  The O&H show hanging with Louis Black.  An old friend, an old buddy stopping by.  Yes.  Voted like funniest comedian in the universe.  Ever of all time.  Just for the year.  Then it's over.  Then the pressure's off.  Then the pressure's off, you know.  Upholding the duties of this.  They don't even remember now. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, there you go.  Look, you've got a naked girl for being the best.  Excellent.  How are you doing?  That's all right, right?  This is excellent.  That's not what I expected for today.  It's better than a stupid award from Comedy Central or something.  And they actually, the award weighs more than her.  Yeah.  She's sitting on your lap.  Yeah, naked girl on Louis Black.  But it's not warm like he's.  No, it's not warm and cuddly, no.  And it's not, no, whatever.  Do you recognize Louis as the doctor in Jacob's Ladder? 
[02:32:00]  No.  The movie Jacob's Ladder?  Good.  No.  I love the movie.  I don't.  Oh, you didn't see Jacob's Ladder, did you?  I just have.  Really?  Right, but she's good.  I didn't see that.  All right, what?  What?  The erotic Jacob's Ladder is the one she's filming next week.  Yeah, she makes erotic B-movies.  Erotic B-movies?  Yes.  I'm a Kit Kat.  Give you a line.  Maybe she'll remember if you give the line, Louis.  You must have friends in high places.  That was it.  That was it for Louis Black.  With the same enthusiasm he just delivered in here. 
[02:32:30]  You know, that's exactly it.  You know what?  You've got to make it go on your own.  You want a Kit Kat?  No, that's fine.  You guys just see.  You're talking about the chocolate in her hand, Louis.  Right, I know.  You sick ass.  You have a Kit Kat on his mind.  You can help me.  Oh, really?  It certainly is.  This is just wrong.  Well, we wanted to reward you for being an award-winning comedian.  Hey, what's some of your movies again? 
[02:33:00]  She's been in more movies than Louis Black.  Probably.  What's the name of the erotic witch project?  Gladiator Eroticus.  Like, they take all the movies.  Erotic Ghost.  Erotic Ghost?  Erotic Ghost.  And what's the plot?  Erotic Survivor.  Oh, right.  Come on.  See, we've got the shirt here, Louis.  See the picture.  That's her.  Erotic Survivor.  Where do you treat these movies?  New Jersey.  New Jersey.  What was I thinking? 
[02:33:30]  I'm thinking Erotic Survivor maybe in Tahiti or something.  No.  That's not all the interesting.  Jersey.  He's also in this movie called I See Dead Strippers.  Yeah.  Take off on Sixth Sense.  Swear to God.  I See Dead Strippers?  Who writes this?  Awesome.  It's great.  You have a plot and everything?  Do you actually memorize the line?  Yeah.  That movie stars a clown that has diarrhea.  Oh, stop it.  And when you've got a clown that has diarrhea in a movie, you're talking a good movie.  Yeah.  This is just clinically insane. 
[02:34:00]  I see dead clowns.  No, I see dead strippers.  Oh, strippers, Louis.  Dead clowns would be silly.  No, you're right.  You're right.  And we want to guess her age, but she won't play along today.  I have this unique talent.  If I see a girl's taint, I can tell you how old she is.  Stop.  What if you just look at Louis' pants after she gets up?  Count the ring.  Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my.  If the impression works, when the cops come and take the tire print from the crime scene, 
[02:34:30]  maybe you can just take it right off of Louis' leg.  I like to play with things.  Me?  Yeah, I have, like, nervous habits.  I, like, I bang, like, yeah, you might hear that.  I bang, too.  Yeah, there you go.  How fat for a topper.  Hey, Louis, notice what she does when she's thinking?  She grabs her boobs.  Yeah.  Isn't that unique?  When you're thinking?  Yeah.  Yeah, look, she's thinking right now.  Is this supposed to worry, Beads?  No, I'm not worried.  I'm thinking if I have something to think about.  If you have a thought, maybe, Louis, you might want to enhance that. 
[02:35:00]  I just grabbed my boobs and thought.  I was just thinking, my God, my hands are on her boobs.  You know what?  We blew it again today, though.  Why?  Why?  This is going to make Louis Black too happy.  We like an angry Louis Black when you come here.  I'm not happy.  I'm in shock.  There's a big difference.  We've moved beyond.  There's happy for a moment.  Right.  And then we go, I have lost this.  This is insane.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  I understand, because sometimes it's awkward in a room full of guys during a radio show 
[02:35:30]  to have a naked woman on your lap, but just relax.  Well, you're the only two guys I can do this.  I didn't have more relax than any of you.  You are?  I'm naked.  Well, you are.  You're absolutely relaxed.  Well, you know, if you've been seeing dead strippers, you know.  I have been seeing them.  I was one of the dead strippers.  You were once?  You had no lines at all?  No, that one I didn't have any lines.  No, you just laid there?  What, did you just pop up?  Yeah, I popped up everywhere.  Interesting.  And the guy would see you?  Yeah.  And what, would he spank it to the dead strippers that he saw?  I don't know. 
[02:36:00]  You don't know the plot of the movie you're in?  I don't know the whole movie.  It was a movie that I only shot on one day, so I don't know the whole thing.  All right, now let me get this straight.  Being in the arts myself, where do you audition?  I mean, how did you, like, the first movie came along, you know,  Gladi Rorys Rerectus, and you went,  Rerectus?  Well, whatever it is.  I'm sorry.  Erotica.  Rerectus would be silly.  There you go.  Don't jump at it.  Oh, you can't say that?  No, you can't say that.  That you can't say? 
[02:36:30]  I don't get what.  You could say metal is hard,  and you could say put this on.  But the second you're going to whack some words together,  you know, you could say something's hard.  Is this a manual that you, like, have that you can use it?  It's the decoder ring that we got in a Cracker Jack box.  That's cool.  It's really, we're responsible broadcasters.  Yeah.  That's not allowed?  You could say, all right, I'll be Ward Cleaver.  Remember?  You could say June, or June Cleaver talking to Ward. 
[02:37:00]  Ward, don't you think you were a little hard on the beaver last night?  Which was the line from the show.  You could say that.  Yeah, you could say that.  But you can't say.  Because I'm still sick.  Oh, you think beaver was sick?  Yeah, I just...  We had a story earlier.  Beaver was sick.  But erotic, whatever you're doing.  You know they put little, like, subliminal things in there.  Just like that.  They did.  Oh, hard on the beaver.  That's right.  And who knows what the whole lumpy character meant, right?  I bet.  I am going to tell you that show. 
[02:37:30]  I watched it, and it had nothing in it.  You're mine was in the gutter like mine was, which is why I do these movies, and you don't.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You have just got to be searching for stuff.  Yeah, because my hat is in the gutter.  I was a good eight minutes into Leave it to Beaver, and I'd pass out.  There's nothing erotic.  There was nothing erotic.  How about erotic Leave it to Beaver?  And you could use a whole twist on the word beaver.  Figure it out yourself.  Whoa, Paul.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul Mercurio.  Oh, God. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, Louis.  Paul, who does some really good radio for us.  Yeah, Louis is in here, Paul.  Charting new territory with a naked woman on his lap.  Yeah, she's nice.  It's like you're like the Donna Party exploring new territory.  And what are you talking about?  You watch Beaver for eight minutes.  You and your personal video library have a loop of Beaver changing out of his underwear,  and you play it over and over again.  Who doesn't?  Yeah, why not?  What's the woman's name that's sitting on your lap?  Uh, Glavioris Erectus. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know if you...  Louis, that's kind of rude.  You don't even know the name of the girl that's on your lap naked?  You didn't introduce us.  Oh, I'm Darian.  You're married?  Darian.  Darian.  Nice to meet you.  It's Darian.  You're supposed to meet before she gets naked.  Yeah.  Well, that was definitely what you guys planned.  It wasn't your show.  You know, we met before.  It wouldn't be fun, would it?  That's why it was ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  You think that's a little awkward, having a naked girl on your lap?  Not anymore.  Of course.  See, now it's like putting on a suit.  Because maybe I'll have your time come to a...  Darian, don't fall in love with him, because he's only got about six months to live. 
[02:39:00]  He has a polyp in his stomach.  Oh!  Tell her about the polyp.  No, I'm not telling her about the polyp.  You got a polyp?  Yeah, I do.  You sure it's not an alien or something?  No, it's not an alien.  Oh, no.  It's a very tiny Jew screaming inside of him.  It's a conjoined twin.  It's just my fear of success.  That's all it is.  It's coming to a head.  I don't know what it is.  No, it's not a boil.  Darian.  Darian's the thought of the boil. 
[02:39:30]  It's a boil.  It's a boil.  I wouldn't be interested.  It's coming to a head.  I know.  They usually come to a head.  Yes, they do.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Lewis is too happy.  We don't like a happy Lewis.  Well, you know what?  Well, I don't know.  I don't think this whole, you know,  writing the awards.  Hard on a leg or something.  No, no.  That's...  I don't know.  I just put it in my day.  But that was the high point of my day.  It just jumped up and down a few times.  And, well, Lewis...  What I want to know is if having a naked woman in the studio  is getting Uncle Junior hot. 
[02:40:00]  All of a sudden, I'm like,  he's calling Lewis's thing Uncle Junior?  I'm like, I'm looking at Lewis's lap going,  Uncle Junior?  I'm not looking at Uncle Junior.  No, no, no, no.  It's hidden by her ass.  I don't hear you as a big C.  You know, he's gay, remember?  I don't like women.  I don't like women, Tony.  I like Dr. Kennedy.  He's handsome.  And he takes care of my ass cancer.  You better watch out, Lewis.  Have that checked in your chest. 
[02:40:30]  Someone is saying,  have Paul do his Tony Soprano impression.  Oh, my Tony Soprano.  Okay, here you go.  When did you start doing this?  Oh, I'm a master of impressions.  Ask these guys.  I've got to do a whole Vegas thing.  Okay, you ready?  I'm talking to Uncle Junior.  Okay.  Good morning, Uncle Junior.  How are you?  That is great.  That is really good.  I'm right on it.  You really are.  When did you start that hacky stuff?  What are we talking about? 
[02:41:00]  We found the next Rich Little.  Really?  I am the next Rich Little.  I'm opening at the jumping laughing bean.  He tells that.  He does that little impression thing  right before he smashes the big watermelon with the mallet.  By the way, can I tell you something in that Gallagher show?  The fruit has no chance.  It can't get away.  It can't roll off.  It's just sitting there.  It's dead from the minute.  Word go.  It's done.  All right, I'll leave you alone.  I'll let you do your thing.  You're lucky you're not here.  You'd be in trouble.  All right, Paul.  Thank you. 
[02:41:30]  Have a good time, Louis.  Thank you, darling.  Louis, don't forget.  Monitor your activities.  Pacemaker is on its third year.  Bye.  Bye.  Now, there's a pal, huh?  No, he's a real sweetheart.  Yeah, sure he is.  Yeah.  He won't be working.  Now that I get that word, he won't be working anymore.  Hey, we got something a little weird.  Remember the kid with the running?  Wait a minute.  Weirder than this?  This is unbelievable.  I just feel like you're...  Louis, the naked girl on his lap.  I feel like this is kind of a ventriloquist act. 
[02:42:00]  You're better at the work.  With your hand.  Yeah, exactly.  Wake me like a puppet.  Hey, while you're down there, could you find out how old you are?  There's no way in hell that you can even...  How old does four knuckles...  Show me the taint and I'll tell you how old you are.  It's a class model.  Show me the taint.  28.  You can see when I get up.  28.  No.  No.  I know exactly how old you are if you show me the taint. 
[02:42:30]  How would you know it on the basis of taint?  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  You can't work off of the pictures we took.  You lose.  Oh, well, you're in the same seat that Rodney Dangerfield was in.  Hey.  Toking a little bit today.  Was he doing a little?  A little bit.  Oh, man.  Rodney, 80 years old, and the guy is...  He's out gigging.  Was he doing...  Was he working?  He did well for us today.  He had some funny things going on.  He was playing in Avery Fisher Hall.  Was he playing in Avery Fisher Hall?  Yeah.  I would say...  I know.  If I'm working at 80, would you guys do me a favor? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Shoot me.  Okay?  If we're sitting around in the studio and, you know,  at that age, I think we should be...  I think they come in and spray us with bullets.  What's with these Martian colonies?  I don't understand why colonize Mars when this planet sucks.  Like at the 80 years old.  Flying cars.  They can't even keep a plane control on the street.  All right.  Ed, they're telling us we've got to take a quick break  because we've got to give away that chance to go to L.A. 
[02:43:30]  for the final episode of Survivor.  I wish I had fluids left in my body so I could spit.  We'll do that next.  More with Louis Black and a guy outside that has a sweaty Rodney Dangerfield towel.  I can't catch my breath when my left arm hurts.  Remember that kid from the beginning of the show?  Yeah.  He finally showed up.  We've got a good story to tell you about this guy.  He's a little...  Oh, good.  Yeah, we'll do that next.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest. 
[02:44:00]  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7  for your chance to win the grand prize trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  102.7 WNEW.  Are you going to be like Rodney or are you going to share?  Oh, my God.  That was funny.  What did he say?  Is he allowed to say it on the air?  He used the H-O word again.  H-O?  Hard.  Oh.  Yeah.  But I say that you can't, you know, taint.  You can say taint. 
[02:44:30]  I can't say that.  Yeah, you can say taint.  But you can't say the other word.  No.  Right.  That's psychotic.  Taint is not a word.  Taint is like one of those made-up words.  It can't blah and it can't twat.  You can say, hey, you're a twat.  You can say you're a twat.  You can say twat.  But you can't say she had a hairy print.  Right.  Then you can't use it.  See, we're experts.  And you could say, hey, Rick, don't be a dick.  Now he can't say it.  No, but I pause.  No, no, no. 
[02:45:00]  You said it, but he dumped that down the hall.  Did he really?  Yeah.  You can't say it.  And you can never.  We're good at this.  We did a whole story about cats earlier.  Yeah.  Substituting the word pussy.  Because it's a pussy cat.  Right.  Yeah.  But you can't say the cat had an ice.  Yeah.  Right.  But you can say the cat had an ice.  No.  No.  No.  You can't say that?  No.  You can call the cat a dick.  But you can tell the cat owner.  You can tell the cat owner. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  This is like unbelievable.  You can tell the cat owner, as you're describing her cat, that she has a nice pussy.  Right.  Because her cat is a nice cat.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  And all together, no matter how you phrase it, you can't do it too much.  Now, could you say, as we did on The Daily Show, stink fingering and then something?  No.  You cannot describe what you are stink fingering.  Right.  We could do it on TV.  How come you can't do it here?  They had BS on CBS Sunday night. 
[02:46:00]  We didn't even talk about that yet on the air.  Yeah.  They were doing it on Golden Pond.  On Golden Pond, and they're saying the BS word over and over again.  Those people that age are allowed to say those words.  Yeah.  Which really had to be brought back as a live production.  Yes.  No.  But it's so much hotter when, like, a young chick is saying BS, not an old hag.  I got lost.  Let me give you a sense, just the folks out there, of my place in the business, why it's  taken me this long to reach whatever position I've reached in this business.  A friend of mine gets a copy of the play. 
[02:46:30]  He gives me the play.  This is when I was writing plays.  And we're in New York.  He says, you know, I've got the opportunity to work on this play.  Tell me what you think of it.  And I read this play.  I go, this play sucks.  This is, you're kidding me.  This is, they think this is going to be big.  He says, that's what they say.  I say, well, it makes me nauseous to read it.  And it was on Golden Barn.  All right.  I just basically told my friend not to even be involved in it.  God knows how much money it was.  That's a good one.  That was a good career move. 
[02:47:00]  Wasn't that good?  Yeah.  Good.  But, you know, that's the kind of, you know, if you ever want to make money, bring it  to me.  And if I hate it, it's going to go.  It's going to be good.  It's going to hit.  All right.  Anthony.  The weakest link.  Who'd have thought?  Who'd have thought?  Uh, hello, Mel Brooks.  Uh, bringing the producers to Broadway is a stupid idea.  Are you going to make money?  No.  Meanwhile, like selling tickets like hotcakes.  All right.  Uh, Planet Java.  Ah.  The coolest thing to hit the streets.  We got good stuff for you, Louis. 
[02:47:30]  Now, you were addicted to that goddamn espresso machine when you first got it.  I remember that.  We got something that's ten times stronger than an espresso.  No, no S.  The people at Planet Java have the thing.  Is it galonic?  Yeah, just about.  It'll clean you out.  It's called Tremble.  Oh, stop it.  It's put out by.  No, this Planet Java.  I was feeling like she was on my leg.  Right, right.  But if you can't get a new chick, get some Tremble.  This is, this Planet Java stuff.  Iced coffee, really good.  Three flavors.  The Tremble is off the hook. 
[02:48:00]  Yo.  That's if you need a heck of a kickback, you homie Opie.  Off the hook.  Yo.  I am glad you said that.  You're really working your street cred.  Yeah, it's 121 milligrams of caffeine.  The highest caffeinated drink in the country.  And here comes the naked girl.  I saw part of your taint when you bent down and closed the door.  You can see right here.  Oh, the imprint on Lewis's leg.  It's 231 grams of caffeine.  Caffeine on his leg. 
[02:48:30]  Tremble, yeah, the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  Lewis, next time you're in here, can you do some Tremble before you go on the air?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, here it is.  Look, it's in a colorful bottle.  We give you the first one free.  Tell your friends.  And then we start charging.  You're going to have a heart attack.  No, Tremble honestly rocks.  It really does.  I did it before the road show.  I was up for like 12 straight hours.  I think if Lewis drinks Tremble, though, he'll dissolve like the transporter room in the Enterprise.  His molecules will just shoot apart and you'll never see them. 
[02:49:00]  You won't.  First of all, you have to worry about it.  Lewis, Lewis, give me the Tremble.  Lewis.  You're smashing and drinking.  Lewis.  Trains the glass for your teeth.  You're going to break your...  Yeah, there you go.  You're going to break your wrist.  You've got to unpeel it.  You've got to unpeel, then turn.  They also have a Javadelic, it's a grown-up milkshake, and Karamoca.  It's a chocolate caramel and a coffee.  And it's a great mixer, too.  You want to booze it up.  Stop it.  Hell, hell yeah.  Stop it.  Why not?  It's a great mixer.  It's a great mixer.  What do you mix it with?  You can mix it with Kahlua.  You can mix it with a little vodka and make a mudslide out of it. 
[02:49:30]  You've never done the coffee alcohol drinks.  They're good.  Great.  Big thing with the kids.  What's wrong?  We're all going to hell.  You guys are so psychotic.  If your retailer doesn't have a Planet Java yet, demand they get it.  Drink a bunch of Tremble, go in there, and just scare the crap out of them.  How do you demand they get it?  Come on!  Get it!  I don't want Coke anymore.  Get me Planet Java.  I want my Planet Java.  Iced coffee, just got cool.  Settle for nothing less. 
[02:50:00]  Planet Java.  You find it anywhere, you will find Coca-Cola products, by the way.  I'm sure you will.  Put out by the same happy family.  Oh, it's the Coke pigs?  Right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sure they edited that.  We love them.  The people who gave us Dysana.  Dysana, the water.  The water?  You know that one?  No.  It's Coke.  It's Coke.  It's water that Coke makes.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  It's brilliant.  It is.  The fact that we're buying it shows that we are just...  We're clinically insane. 
[02:50:30]  Well, yep.  Poland Spring.  Well, here we are, just advertising anybody.  A little bit of everything.  Poland Spring, that's from, like, Pittsburgh, that water.  Yeah.  Just get it out of a tap anyway.  Right.  Hello?  That's why you should drink Planet Java products, like Java, Della, Caramoca, and, of course,  Tremble.  Now, take a taste.  What do you think?  Not of the girl, of the Tremble.  What are you doing?  He's already shaking before he drinks the Tremble.  Good, right?  That's good.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'm smacking my lips. 
[02:51:00]  Look at him.  He doesn't want to do anything good.  No, it doesn't taste.  I love it.  You know what the ingredient is?  Crystal meth.  It'll really perk you up.  That explains the edginess to me.  In five minutes, you'll either be doing some of the best stuff ever or killing a family  of four.  It's wonderful.  What is that flavor?  Do you want to drink?  What is that?  Uh-oh.  What is that?  It's people, damn you.  It's people.  Damn you all to hell. 
[02:51:30]  Caramoca, Java, Della, Xemba.  It's people.  Damn you.  Damn you, Planet Java.  I'm back right on the home of Planet Java.  I thought I was hundreds of thousands of light years away.  But I'm Planet of the Apes, Java.  It's people.  Look at the decrepit schedule of liberty.  Nova.  Drink Java, Della.  I taught you to speed your face off. 
[02:52:00]  Dr. Zay is Papa Java Delic.  It's a great mixer, Zira.  Mix it up or something.  Before you know, we're all drinking trouble.  And it's a matter.  A matter.  Mix it up.  We'll all read the sacred scrolls and crank each other off.  Come on, Dr. Zira.  Get over here.  We'll do anal.  I love it.  Look at Cornelius working Zira with that bottle. 
[02:52:30]  It's heresy.  Would Java Delic make a doll that speaks?  A human doll?  No, and I don't even care.  Just give me another one.  And guns.  Java Delic, the people at Planet Java love guns.  Guns in tremble.  You won't even know when you're going to pull the trigger.  Give ten years lead to the NRA.  And drink tremble.  And go hunting with friends. 
[02:53:00]  Slime folks.  That's how John Heston does it.  Because I'm insane.  You've cut out his brain.  Take your stinking paws off my tremble, you damn dirty ape.  Oh, man.  Brought to you by the people that bring you Coca-Cola.  Yeah.  Quite a job, Bob.  You know, we've got to get through a few more commercials.  So we should ask the question for the trip to L.A., Anthony.  Yes.  To qualify someone for the trip to L.A.  We did a video clip this morning on CBS at 6 a.m. hour. 
[02:53:30]  Boy, oh, boy.  Well, we've got to ask a question about this clip they saw this morning.  Oh, I got one.  Okay, go ahead.  What did I call the boomerang that I threw at your head?  Nice.  All right.  All right.  If you know the answer, give us a call, and you'll be qualified to go to L.A. to see  the final episode of Survivor.  Louis Black's favorite show.  That'll be something you want to do.  Then you want to leap on that.  You want to really get on there.  You don't want to answer that question.  And then, if you get the prize, why don't you just walk into the street among traffic 
[02:54:00]  and let a couple of cars hit you?  You'd be better all played up in traction watching any other thing anywhere.  You go to Los Angeles.  You live in New York.  You live in the heart of it.  Are you going to go out to that sex pool?  Why don't you go out there and have a great time?  You know how loud the void is?  You know what the sound of the void sounds like?  Okay?  That's it.  Your brain will be sucked in your head within less than 10 seconds.  You won't even know where you are.  You won't even know what day it is.  Darian, could you sit on his lap again, please?  You happy now? 
[02:54:30]  He's angry.  He's angry.  Sit on his lap.  He's always angry, and we'd have him no other way.  Right.  Right.  There.  Calm down.  Oh, Jesus.  Suckle.  Suckle.  There you go.  The milk is coming from my teeth.  Holy Jesus.  We're making more Planet Java right now.  I think they're canoodling.  There's a post, though.  He says canoodling.  They're canoodling.  A couple commercials, and then we'll qualify someone. 
[02:55:00]  We'll qualify someone for the trip to L.A.  The Opie and Anthony Survivor Getaway Contest is brought to you by CBS2.  Trip to Los Angeles courtesy of Delta Business Elite Class.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2 of it you guys won't think to.  It's the bottom.  Hey, stop.  1027 WNEW.  Just a few minutes left in this show today, unfortunately. 
[02:55:30]  We were just getting started with Lewis Slack.  I know.  We've got to get a qualifier for the trip to L.A., Anthony.  Got a chance of winning a trip to L.A.  You fly on Delta Business Elite.  Three days and two nights in Los Angeles.  Hotel accommodations and transfers.  Plus $200 spending money.  That'll get you across the street.  And, of course, you get to see the town hall meeting they do with the Survivor Caps. 
[02:56:00]  That'll be special.  There you go.  That'll be a special moment.  See which creep wins this.  It's history, Lewis.  On what planet?  Where are you living?  It's history.  This is history in the making.  No.  History is Hitler goes into the Sudetenland, 19-whatever.  This is totally bogus.  If you think about it, this is the first time they're announcing the Survivor winner where no one knows who won yet.  This is reality, Lewis.  This is like a big, huge event to take the reality. 
[02:56:30]  Did I miss a couple of weeks with you?  I lived for a couple of weeks and now you've just completely lost your mind.  I see this as like history.  We love the reality shows.  I'm sure you do.  We sit down and watch every one of them.  I'm sure you do.  The wrestling, I'm almost, I'm forgiving you for the wrestling.  I'll forgive you for the wrestling.  Now, what's wrong with wrestling?  Nothing's wrong with wrestling.  You like a fake sport?  Great.  But I forgive you for that.  Do you like anything we do at this point?  You don't like our sponsors? 
[02:57:00]  You don't like our subjects?  That's the sad thing.  You give me a naked girl and this is how you, uh...  Oh, now you're going to start whining?  I can't believe that.  I can't believe you're taking my abuse instead of turning it back on me.  With guilt.  The one thing that can get you to do faster than anything else.  Wrestlers are real athletes.  Oh, guilt's coming at me.  Oh!  Oh!  What?  Wrestlers are real athletes.  Right.  No, they are.  I'm not saying.  I didn't, I said.  That's fine.  I forgive you for that.  I think it's great.  I mean, I have actually enjoyed wrestling.  I will never forget what you just said about wrestling. 
[02:57:30]  We're going to get Triple H in your face.  No, don't get him in my face.  Please.  No.  All right, we got to get...  I like watching him from afar.  We got to qualify someone for this trip to L.A., Anthony.  All right.  Yeah, this morning on the CBS Morning Show, we did a little clip.  Did a little live clip.  And if you watched it, you would have seen a boomerang, me throwing it, hitting Opie in the back of the head.  What did I call the boomerang?  Well, we listened to Sweet Nothings being whispered in Lewis's ear by the lovely... 
[02:58:00]  Lewis, did she just ask you out?  No.  Oh.  No, it's a little more special than that.  Steven.  Oh, yes.  You got an answer to the question?  Australian for 50.  Oh, look how easy that was.  There it is.  Someone was watching TV this morning.  I was.  All right, Steven, you qualified for the trip to go to L.A.  Can you leave Thursday morning, though?  Yes, I can.  All right, very cool.  Hold on the line, all right?  Thank you very much.  If you're treating the cases of this planet Java, you'll be there in six minutes.  It's going to run.  All right, Steven, we got to get you on hold because we're running out of time here.  But congratulations, all right? 
[02:58:30]  Thank you very much.  All right, there you go.  Steven has qualified for the trip to L.A.  Make sure you listen.  Watch tomorrow morning in the 6 a.m. hour for the next video clue.  Our last video clue, I believe.  Yeah.  And our last qualifier tomorrow at 6.30.  Bring up a good point.  This is kind of restricted against blind people.  When you say, listen, now the blind can't enjoy the Survivor Town Hall meeting because they have no chance of a winning.  Well, that's the point.  When you wish you're blind, you know?  When you're given the choice of going to watch Survivor be blind, you go, well, you know, maybe it's an option. 
[02:59:00]  Maybe I'll take, like, you know, like an awl and poke it in my eye for a minute, okay?  Oh, it's all right?  No, I don't like that show.  It's a disgusting, disgusting show.  And it's reduced us to, like, barking dogs and little pigs.  What does Louis Black like on TV?  Yeah, what do you like?  What do I like?  I like to go...  Yes?  Nope, I like to go really quickly and make my own channel.  I like to make your own channel.  That's brilliant.  I do that. 
[02:59:30]  Don't you do it?  It's like, three seconds of this and I say, oh, look, look, there's a giant can.  I watched that for ten seconds.  Then an infomercial about...  Monkage TV.  An infomercial about...  I'll watch an infomercial about skin cream for eight minutes.  It makes no...  That's insane.  You look like a Days of Our Lives type of guy.  Oh, yeah.  That's something I really watch.  You know what I do with the Days of Our Lives?  I would take the video of it and actually put it in my butt.  That's what I do with the Days of Our Lives.  On tomorrow's show. 
[03:00:00]  Right here.  All right, can we get it?  No, and I watch it.  You don't like that?  I could see you doing that, though.  Just, like, flicking through the channel.  There's nothing on.  There's nothing on.  You're freaking out.  And what's disgusting is now I watch really bad movies.  Now that I have, like, HBO, 19 HBOs, and Cinemax.  Yeah.  I watch really bad movies.  Movies that have, you know, that I just sit there the whole time going,  How did they make this movie?  How come nobody, I don't get to do anything in film,  and these idiots got hundreds of thousands of dollars to wander around,  you know, like this?  Are you making fun of the erotic, uh, with projects?  Not at all.  Okay.  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:00:30]  I would like to see that.  They spent three whole days filming that, Louis.  Well, that's solid.  Give her a little prop.  Huh?  Give her some props for that.  Well, I am.  Three days.  Three long days.  They don't show this on Cinemax.  You know how hard it is to concentrate for three straight days?  And a brush fire off, uh, Route 80 is now destroying what was the set.  Right.  Right.  Get the guy with the towel in here.  We really got to get out of here.  Yeah.  All right.  The guy with Rodney Bainfield.  It sounds like he got a light.  We really got to get out of here.  We're going to, uh, like a staff party. 
[03:01:00]  No.  Yeah, they're trying to get the whole staff together again.  Back together again.  We're going to get drunk and we're either going to fight or we're going to start getting along  again.  Oh, that is great.  We're going, uh, where are we going?  That's good.  All right.  We can't announce where we're going?  What's up, man?  All right.  Ben, like a thousand people are going to show up because we mentioned where we're going  tonight.  Phoebe King.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  How you doing?  Oh, that's the famous Louis Black.  Yeah, how you doing?  Voted 20th man in the universe.  Yeah, I know.  I told him.  I met, uh, you know, uh, I didn't meet Rodney, but it's an honor.  He's a comedian too, this kid.  Yeah.  I just thought about two months ago, though. 
[03:01:30]  Two months ago?  Yeah.  You gigging?  Well, I'm doing a lot of, like, amateur shows and everything like that.  Open mic night?  Yeah, hanging out at the Comedy Cellar, Gotham.  You want to give us a little?  No.  Give us a little of the act.  A little bit of my act?  Yeah, kind of quick, what are you open with kind of thing.  Well, I'll basically open when, you know, uh, I just talk about, oh, my God, I can't believe I'm here.  I'm so freaking nervous.  Woo!  Yeah!  Yeah, Joe, I did this.  Nah, um, nah, I don't know.  I talk about, you know, uh, thanks for, you know, being here.  You know, my parents didn't come tonight. 
[03:02:00]  You know, I asked them to come, but, uh, they had better things to do.  And they do this every freaking night, you know?  It's as if, uh, you know, 18 years ago they said, hey, let's have a son and not support it.  You know, and hopefully they go, ha, ha, ha.  And then, uh, you know, I'll be like, uh, you know, I know what they're doing now.  They're here, uh, they're not here tonight because they're taking an opportunity, me being out of the house to have sex.  Yeah, and, um, you know, I, I find, uh, rubbers in my father's door.  And, uh, you know, I asked them the other day, I said, Daddy, you know, I'm 18 years old now.  Are you moms still having sex?  And my dad, he's like one of those guys that are, like, really old but can't accept the fact that he's old.  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:02:30]  Like, um, what do you call them guys?  Losers.  Anyway, uh.  Be more funny.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to say it.  You're doing fine.  All right.  We're just messing with you.  You're fine.  John, what's up?  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Listen, I learned today.  I'll give you a quick what I learned today.  Rodney Dangerfield Bogart's the joint.  He did, man.  Yeah.  There you go, boys.  Hey, what can I tell you, huh?  You're going to get stalled, you know?  He also lipped it.  Ooh. 
[03:03:00]  The politically correct version of what you just said.  This guy is freaked out.  And he's got the towel in a bag.  He met Rodney Dangerfield.  Here's the story.  God, I'm so bummed.  We ran out of time.  Yeah, I know.  There's a lot of good things still to do here.  Yep.  All right.  Basically.  Well, let's get Gary Coleman on the phone.  Basically, he went and saw Rodney, right?  Right.  He went and saw Rodney, went to shake his hand.  Rodney wouldn't shake his hand.  So now he's thinking in his head, wait, maybe Rodney's got a little disease.  So then he's like, all right, he thought about it.  And then he realizes he has Rodney's sweaty towel. 
[03:03:30]  How do you get Rodney's sweaty towel?  He threw it at me.  And he got it.  Yeah.  So now he's thinking, okay, Rodney didn't.  Get away from me, huh?  Rodney didn't shake my hand, but I have a sweaty towel.  He might have something.  I might have caught something from Rodney's sweat.  Dead serious.  Ask him.  I listened to the thing before when I was on the radio, and I did sound like absolutely  retarded.  But I was really nervous, you know, because I got doing it.  It's like you used to open your hand today.  I listen every day.  But his whole body sucks.  That's right.  It sucks.  It sucks.  No, I don't know.  He was on the show the other day talking about his health, and then he wouldn't shake, like, 
[03:04:00]  not just my hand, but anybody.  So, you know, I just thought, you know, does he have some?  And when I wrote you the email, I wasn't trying to be funny or, like, retarded.  I was just literally curious, you know?  He was a little paranoid that he might have caught something from Rodney.  No, you don't catch something.  If somebody didn't want to shake your hand, it also may mean that they don't want to get  something from you.  Yeah, that could be.  Maybe Rodney's like, hey, who's this kid?  Did he wash his hands after going to the bathroom?  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  There's a lot of guys who don't do that.  You know?  I don't shake people's hands.  I put it on their leg. 
[03:04:30]  Show my affection.  Show my affection.  The guy that opened for him told me that, you know, if he shakes one person's hand, you  got to shake everybody.  So, you know, I understood.  It'd be a long night for Rodney.  Right.  All right.  Well, thanks for coming in.  Thank you, everybody.  Let's see the towel.  Let's see the famous sweaty towel.  Let's see the sweaty towel.  Oh, you're handling it.  Hey, I slid on that, huh?  I don't know.  Clone your own Rodney.  I was hoping that he would sign it or whatever, but, you know, he lost.  Get some DNA and clone me.  Thanks for letting me come in.  I seriously appreciate it.  All right, man.  I'll sign it. 
[03:05:00]  You got to do it.  All right.  Fluid signs Rodney's towel.  We'll have the naked girl sit on it.  What?  This is a comic book that I've been learning a lot.  So far, I got Jim Norton and Jim Brewers and Ray Romano's autograph  Oh, yeah?  What about Lewis Black?  Yeah, no.  I mean, him and you, you know.  You're learning out of that book?  Yeah, I'm learning a lot.  And also from going to a lot of open mics and everything like that.  I give the guy a lot of credit.  There you go.  Going after himself for the...  What can you expect in the future of a comedy?  The best thing, if you do really outside of that, is to every night when you finish doing 
[03:05:30]  a set is to go home and put your head in a toilet bowl and flush it.  And then you'll feel better.  Because that's how the owner, the comedy club owner...  When you started out, you went to a bunch of open mics and everything?  When I started out, there wasn't even a club.  I just did it literally at my house and invited people over.  There weren't any comedy clubs.  I worked...  Oh, I thought it was so much funnier.  I could have said...  Don't worry.  Shut up.  And that's the story of your life.  That's what it's going to be.  I just did it and did it and did it and then did it some more.  I was horrible.  And before you know it, see? 
[03:06:00]  He's getting awards.  Yeah, Louis.  Congratulations. </pre>
