<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, likely spanning several hours, covered a wide range of topics with its signature blend of vulgar humor, listener interaction, and news commentary.  The show began with Opie's discovery of a nude male image inside an Abercrombie & Fitch cologne bottle, sparking a discussion on the brand's homoerotic marketing and extending to listener anecdotes about retail store experiences.  This transitioned into a comparison of gratuitous nudity in 80s movies (like *Trading Places*, *Caddyshack*, and *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*) with modern cinema, fueled by more listener calls.

A substantial portion focused on the fallout from the hosts' April Fool's Day prank in Boston, involving a false report of the mayor's death.  They recounted the ensuing controversy with Boston radio personalities Dennis and Callahan, playing listener calls made to harass their show, and reacted to criticism from their former producer, Rick Delgado, reading excerpts from his recent interview.  Hillary Clinton’s ill-received April Fool's Day bowling challenge to Barack Obama was also mocked using audio clips of her statements.

The show then delved into their participation in a "Rochester Radio Madness" bracket competition, targeting Terry Clifford, a radio host whose appearance and online biography became the subject of highly offensive and crude jokes from Opie and Anthony.  This segment included listener prank calls and appearances from comedian Jim Jefferies, who shared anecdotes about his mother, radio experiences (including a firing for using "slutty"), and observations on other radio personalities like Scott Shannon. Comedian Jeff Ross also made a brief appearance.

A comedic segment centered around a *To Catch a Predator* episode where a suspect plugged the Opie and Anthony show.  Audio clips were played, followed by listener calls and stories.  The hosts recounted a previous *To Catch a Predator* segment with Chris Hansen, playing audio clips of the pedophiles' statements that made Hansen uncomfortable.  Jim Norton and Jeffrey Ross joined as guests, sharing sexually suggestive and vulgar personal anecdotes. A poorly executed April Fool's Day prank by another radio show targeting a grandmother was discussed and played, eliciting amusement and disgust from the hosts and guests.  Further discussion encompassed news stories about students plotting against a teacher and a teacher facing child abuse charges. Ross also recounted a physical altercation during a *Real World* reunion.

The next segment started with a discussion about the reported death of radio personality Darian O'Toole, initially treated as a joke until the hosts called Howie's 81-year-old grandmother, Nance, who was experiencing chest pains.  The call devolved into morbid humor and the "Olive Who?" bit.  The death was later confirmed as real, followed by listener-submitted jokes and anecdotes about poorly executed radio pranks.  Jim Jefferies rejoined, engaging in sexually explicit conversations about his experiences with women from different countries.  The segment included an angry voicemail from John Dennis of WEEI directed at a listener and discussions about other listener calls, including one about a violent outburst.  A “guess the sound” segment and stories about a hat repossession from a 101-year-old woman concluded this part.

The show concluded with a segment featuring a video of a large Black man assaulting an elderly woman.  The hosts and guests reacted with a mix of shock and laughter, repeatedly replaying the video and commenting on various aspects.  A news report detailing the robbery and assault was played, followed by discussions about personal lives, stand-up routines, and offensive slang. Jeff Ross was mentioned as a guest, and other comedians were referenced.  The show ended with the usual sign-offs and promotions.  Numerous callers contributed throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want a petted deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want a petted deer with breast knuckles.  Clock up with breast knuckles.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out. 
[00:01:00]  What does it smell like when one of them burped?  An old tackle box.  Where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking Spanish.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Morning.  How's everybody this morning?  Wake up.  Wake up.  Hang up.  Hi.  What is it, Wednesday?  Whip'em Out Wednesday?  Yeah, it is.  Jesus Christ.  Holy moly.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  We got the instant feedback.  The one we read is on the website that we can't promote.  That is named after this radio show, right?  Yeah.  I think OANARadio.com has an instant feedback, but we don't really read that one. 
[00:02:00]  No, I don't know where that goes.  That just goes into like, I don't know.  Into cyberspace.  Yeah, into cyberspace.  Lost somewhere.  But very, very important to send some feedback to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course it is.  I got a quick little thing to start off the radio show.  Yes.  I brought in a very innocent box today.  Yes.  Very innocent.  I was running out of cologne. 
[00:02:30]  Cologne.  Cologne kidney.  And one of the colognes I like is from Abercrombie & Fitch.  Oh, is it?  Because when I buy their clothes, I guess they like squirt it with cologne so they get you  hooked.  You're like, yeah, I kind of like that smell.  They do that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  That's kind of a scam.  So it's one of the colognes I pick up from time to time.  So my girl actually noticed I was running low.  She was out shopping and she decided to get me a nice little bottle of Abercrombie & Fitch 
[00:03:00]  Fierce Cologne.  Fierce.  Which I hold in my hand.  And it's just been sitting on my desk.  And I even told Anthony, I'm like, this is today's first bit.  And I bet you don't even know why.  But I couldn't fathom why that is the first segment bit thing to discuss on the show.  My girl also said she can't stand Abercrombie & Fitch whatsoever anymore because as soon as 
[00:03:30]  you walk into the place, there's guys without shirts on.  I mean, if you do that in any other establishment, they would call the authorities.  But, you know, for Abercrombie & Fitch, it's just normal to have, like, topless guys as  little girls are walking around, like, trying to get a dumb little shirt or skirt for the  summer.  But anyway, she dealt with the club music.  And here in New York, they now have, like, velvet ropes and, like, kind of a red carpet  because the store gets so crowded. 
[00:04:00]  They actually make people wait outside.  No, thanks.  I'm just looking.  They make people wait outside because it's so packed.  As soon as you walk in the door, there's naked men everywhere.  And there's club music going on so loud that you can't get anyone's attention.  Do they understand this is a clothing store?  Yeah, exactly.  It's not a club.  Well, there is something going on out there in these clothing stores where they hire people 
[00:04:30]  not to help you, the shopper.  They hire people to just hang out.  It's a hang now.  To make it look like it's the place to be.  That's the place to be.  I guess.  Isn't this great?  Yeah.  Because some of these stores, if you attempt to ask one of these people for help, they  get really annoyed.  Because I guess that's not their job.  Their job is to just hang.  I don't know.  Hey, this is great cologne.  So, my girl dealt with the homoerotic club atmosphere to get me a nice bottle of cologne. 
[00:05:00]  I brought it in today.  And Anthony, I want you to open up the bottle.  Why?  To reveal the first bit of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no.  Now, remember, this is Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce Cologne.  It's a man's cologne.  And a smell I enjoy.  All righty.  Innocent enough.  It's just a very boring.  A box of fierce cologne.  A very boring gray box of cologne, right? 
[00:05:30]  Open up the top.  Open up that bad boy.  Smells good, right?  It just has a regular little silver top here as I open the box up.  And I pull it out.  What?  Top came off.  Oh, all right.  Okay, there we go.  I didn't booby-track it.  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  Oh, what the hell is going on?  What day is today?  Oh, come on.  Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008.  I officially announce I am done with Abercrombie & Fitch.  Is there any reason to have a nude man on the inside of the bottle? 
[00:06:00]  Cologne bottle.  It's pretty much a man from his neck to, I mean, really right there.  Right.  To his lower abdomen where if they go any lower, you're seeing junk.  So then my girl is, we're looking at this bottle like, did you pick me up like a chick  cologne?  Because why would they want, why would a guy want that? 
[00:06:30]  Exactly.  Why?  That's what I say all the time about the underwear that they sell and everything else.  They put these guys on there.  But that's got to, the underwear is one thing.  Right.  Because you throw the box away and the guy's gone.  Right.  But that has got to sit in your bathroom.  Yeah.  And for the people out there, it's, you know, obviously the cologne bottle is see-through.  And on the inside, on the back wall of the cologne bottle, it's basically a nude man.  Yeah.  I mean, he looks terrific and he knows how to do core exercises. 
[00:07:00]  I'll tell you that much.  Great abs.  Right.  You know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm a little jealous that I can't get my body down to this, uh, this size anymore.  He's probably 20.  Yeah, exactly.  I count one, two, three, four, five.  I lose count of 10 abs.  10.  He's got a 10 pack.  I think he has a 10 pack.  Why?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Explain to me why. 
[00:07:30]  There's no guy unless you're really, uh, into the, uh, homosexual lifestyle.  Right.  That would want that staring at you every morning when, when you go to put on your, your cologne.  Yeah.  In my bathroom, I got my colognes all lined up and now I got this one to add to the, uh,  you know, the group of colognes and it's a, it's a nude man.  Uh.  Why?  Why the homoerotic crap?  I just want a pair of ripped jeans and a cologne that smells nice and maybe some type 
[00:08:00]  of rugby, uh, shirt.  You know, there's a, a picture of a boat on Old Spice.  Right.  You don't have to worry about that.  You don't have to worry.  Nothing, uh, nothing shady about a little boat.  My, my girl just openly laughed at me.  I'm like, why are you laughing at me?  You bought this.  She was laughing.  Oh, yeah.  She goes.  That's good.  Is that unbelievable?  How is it a dispense?  Do you have to jerk the top of the bottle? 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And then, it's good.  And then, of course, uh, she explains that this is the only thing she bought in Abercrombie  and Fitch yesterday.  And, uh, they put it in one of those massive homoerotic bags on top of it.  Yeah.  The bags at Abercrombie also covered.  It was a huge shopping bag for this tiny bottle of cologne.  Well, you are, when you shop there and you leave the store, you become an advertisement,  a walking billboard for Abercrombie and Fitch. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I thought you meant for the gay community.  Well, that too.  The bags are giant and they are just covered with nude men.  And you're walking around like, I'm in the mall, I'm hetero, and I'm just carrying around  a giant, it's pretty much a 20 by 20 inch photo of a naked man that I'm now going to  carry around.  Yeah.  This is, this is, this is porn.  This is gay porn.  Yeah.  That's pretty much gay porn that you bought yesterday.  This is gay. 
[00:09:30]  Look at the, what am I, what, what am I supposed to do with this?  You don't look at that bottle and go, oh yeah, I forgot my cologne today.  You're spraying it on yourself.  That's wonderful.  You want some, Jimmy?  I have a bit from yesterday already on my shirt.  Oh, do you?  Oh, do you really?  Yeah.  So can I, give me the box back so I can hide the nude man.  Oh, there it is.  See, cause the box itself is innocent enough, but I, uh, I can't have this bottle displayed.  My God, man.  There's a cologne called, um, and for some reason that looks gayer. 
[00:10:00]  Like there's a cologne I used to use called Le Mall.  And it's by, I think it's by, uh, Le Mall.  Yes.  I think it's by, I think it's by, uh, Jean Paul Gaultier.  Jean Paul Gaultier.  And it really, really is a man's torso up to the mid side, but it's not naked.  Oh, I know the one you're talking about.  And the woman's has like breasts.  If you just know that this is identifying it as a man's.  Right.  And the woman's is identifying it as a woman's.  That really does look gay.  That's just homoerotic.  It's, it's, it's a picture that you would want to look at if you were a gay gentleman. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I don't really understand why, like, what are they going after with this marketing?  Obviously they're into the nude man, but, uh, but it's not a good, it's not a chick store.  There's a lot of, there's a lot of guys, straight guys that, that like their, their stuff.  So why do we have to deal with this?  Uh, Hugh Junit, Hugh Junit.  Yeah.  Uh, is asking, uh, do you spritz the cologne on the small of your back?  I'm done.  I'm done with this store.  I can't do this anymore. 
[00:11:00]  Well, yeah.  They finally crossed the line with me.  I can't deal, you know, and enough with the naked, uh, naked guy on the, on the, the, the, the, the, the underpants packaging.  I still call them underpants.  Underpants.  All right.  I just need underpants so I don't leak.  Yeah.  You go into, I don't give a crap how I look at them.  All right.  You just need something made of bounty.  Right.  I don't, I don't really care.  Yeah.  Because then you, then you start studying the boxes going, yeah, I think I, yeah, I think I'll look like this guy when I put them on. 
[00:11:30]  Because you do want, uh, your underpants to have, uh, the right, uh, cut, I guess.  You want the right style.  So you can't just grab it off the rack and, and know that you got the right one.  Yeah.  You got to look.  And meanwhile, you're looking at what amounts to a giant wall of gay porno.  Cause they're, the, the boxes are covered with just men, naked men.  It's like, I want to buy, I don't want to buy fruit of the looms. 
[00:12:00]  Like I did when I was seven years old.  I'd like, you know, some, uh, a little better, uh, undergarment.  I, I, I really don't even care.  No, no.  As long as it's like this, you know, fresh cotton.  And that's, that's about it.  I don't really care.  I have Hanes on today.  That's basically, that's easy, but that's basically fruit alone.  What are you talking about?  I know that's what I'm saying.  Hanes is cheap.  I'm not wearing, uh, expensive undies today.  I got Hanes too, because that's the only one I could find that didn't have a new man on the packaging.  I have Hugo Boss underwear. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I got another brand with the naked men on the, on the box.  Are they at least boxer briefs?  Uh, I have some boxer briefs.  I got some regular ones.  I, I have an assortment now, you know, for any occasion, I'm hanging around the house.  If I need quick access to my cock, hope he's in today.  Who knows?  You know, sometimes I have a rooster that needs tending to, and I need quick access to him. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, oh, Jesus.  Let me say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Uh, I feel like a hypocrite, because every time I, uh, I mean, I listen to you guys forever,  and I just started working there, because I need a little part-time job, but, uh, and there's hot girls there,  but I have to stay in the front of the store and listen to that stupid dance music, and I feel like, I don't know,  I feel like, you know, Paul R. Nelson lingered longer.  All right, Matt, thank you. 
[00:13:30]  Uh, I, there's hot girls in Abercrombie and Fitch, really.  You wouldn't know with all the naked men around the place.  They're not catering.  They're not.  I don't shop there.  They're not catering to guys.  Or straight guys.  I go to the Gap.  Just go to the Gap.  Trust me, the Gap will do the same thing.  Oh, I know.  I think this is some kind of weird trend that's going to, like, take off.  It started at Abercrombie and Fitch, but I think other stores are going to get jealous,  and you're going to see more and more nude men in clothing stores where guys shop. 
[00:14:00]  I don't understand.  You know what's a creepy store to have to go into?  Forever 21.  Yeah, I've been in there a couple of times.  You just walk around and go, like, I'm a creep.  Let's say hi to Pat.  What's up, Pat?  Pat.  Hey.  Yes, sir.  Speak.  The voice throws him.  Yeah, you're on the air, sir.  Okay, yeah, no, the voice threw me.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, I used to work there, 
[00:14:30]  and they actually discriminate towards fat people  because for girls, anything that's above a size 8,  it's out back, and you have to specially ask for it.  Oh, really?  So they embarrass the fat?  As if they don't make you feel bad enough as you walk in  with these pictures of muscly men.  If you're a little bit fat,  and for guys, it's anything that's above a 38 waist,  you have to specially ask for it.  Wait, wait, Pat.  Yeah, I know, right?  Pat, what store do you work on?  Like, what town or city?  I'm from Boston.  I don't know if you've ever heard of it. 
[00:15:00]  There's a little town called Nashua, New Hampshire,  right on the border.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  That's where the duct tape comes from.  And that's where the...  Tax-free, man.  And the booby clubs, you know, right over the border.  You know, what do you think?  We were born yesterday.  Wait, tight?  No, they are pretty good.  Anthony, why do you say duct tape?  Not as good as Montreal.  No, they make duct tape there.  Really?  How would you know that?  I used duct tape for a long time in my sheet metal work.  Yeah, it's my abductions.  Hey, little Jimmy.  You're hysterical.  I'm here.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir. 
[00:15:30]  I just want to say, man, I'm a huge fan.  I love your stuff.  Thank you very much, man.  I've been listening for a long time.  I think you guys are great.  Thank you, Pat.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  No, but what we get here in New York is Pat saying, you know,  they have the pictures of the nude guys.  Most Abercrombie Fitch stores, as soon as you walk in,  they have the pictures of the nude guys.  But here in New York, we're lucky enough to have real nude guys.  How much of an outrage would there be if there was a store  and there was pretty much scantily clad women that were just paid to be there, 
[00:16:00]  to stand there in, let's say, really revealing bikinis or something?  You'd have this, oh, this is an awful thing.  It's degrading women.  It's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But you could just parade these naked guys around a store, and it's no problem.  Well, Hooters.  You mean like regular?  First of all, let me just say, those outfits at Hooters,  and I have an advertiser, then great, welcome, we love you, Hooters. 
[00:16:30]  Change your goddamn outfits on your girls.  It looks like 1970s softball team clothes that these girls are wearing.  ABA shorts, basically.  They're horrid.  They play for the San Diego Conquistadors.  And then they wear those.  That's really good for old school basketball fans, I'll tell you right now.  They wear those thick stockings.  Yeah.  And the shorts are not cut right. 
[00:17:00]  It just looks awful.  And they're attractive girls.  If they were made to wear something a little nicer, they'd sell more wings.  If you want to see hot models, Hawaiian Tropic.  Oh, that's always been...  We're pretty much, you know what, every morning to ourselves because of the advertising  and the papers for Hawaiian Tropic here in New York City.  Yeah, they got new girls in there like every day.  They got a blonde and a brunette that they rotate in the paper every other day.  Yeah.  These two girls are just ridiculous.  Yeah, you rotate. 
[00:17:30]  Ridiculous.  You know, all right, yeah, you got the nude guys in Abercrombie Fitch.  Bring back the nude girls and we'll call it even at least.  At least we'll call it even.  Even at maybe Fredericks or something.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Have girls walk around in that store just dressed in the lingerie.  Go with Victoria's Secret.  Victoria's Secret.  That's a huge store, obviously, so take the Abercrombie and Fitch logic and have girls,  as soon as you walk in the store, just in tiny little pieces of lingerie.  Yeah, little boy shorts. 
[00:18:00]  There would be a boycott outside that store immediately.  Because all these disgusting housewives would be so horrified as their husbands are just drooling  looking at these girls.  Right.  So they would have to make a big stink about it.  My eyes front!  I got an idea.  Let's get Big A.  Big A.  Topless.  And Pat from Wynaki.  Topless.  Great.  This better go somewhere, because so far it sucks. 
[00:18:30]  And have them walk around Abercrombie and Fitch.  Until someone says you have to put your shirt on.  And then Big A could stammer his way, they're naked.  We should be able to take our clothes off.  Really fast, because now you reminded me of something else.  I was bored on Sunday, and I was doing a little movies on demand, and I'm like, ah, trading  places. 
[00:19:00]  I mentioned this yesterday or the day before, so I popped that on.  Oh, classic.  And a huge smile came to my face.  I'm watching the movie with my girl.  We're just enjoying ourselves.  We're in bed just watching a movie, mellowing out.  And they had the booby shot.  Of course.  And I just started smiling.  She goes, what?  Jamie Lee Curtis?  No, before that, when Eddie Murphy throws a party in his new pad, and all of a sudden  the girls decide they just have to be topless in the middle of this party.  And they're just dancing topless. 
[00:19:30]  And I'm smiling.  My girl looks at me like, why are you smiling?  And I had to explain to her, this is where the age difference becomes fun.  I go, back in the day, every movie had a booby shot.  And they took that out of movies.  And in this scene in Trading Places, there was no reason for the girls to be nude.  No need.  Except to show really nice boobs.  In the middle of the movie, it's almost like, all right, we'll take a break from the movie  to show you some boobs.  That's pretty much what they did.  And they used to do it in every single movie. 
[00:20:00]  And I had a smile on my face because it brought me right back.  I'm like, ah, remember the good old days?  You would go to the movie theater and you got to see a little, just a little, a little  taste of porn during your comedy.  You watch any one of those R-rated comedies from the early 80s, mid-80s.  They will all have the gratuitous booby shot.  Can I tell you that when I used to, I would say like, when I had, it was only HBO or like  the movie channel.  And Stir Crazy had a strip club scene where there was a girl's ass and it was a certain, 
[00:20:30]  I can still, I can remember the song.  And the angle her ass would be at would be the part that I had to be absolutely ready  on because there was no pausing.  Yeah.  No.  You know, the session had to be over at that moment.  Right.  So my father would be in the room and I would always put on MTV to get him out.  I knew he would leave.  That's like father repellent back then.  Exactly.  Just chase him away with some MTV.  He's trying to have a father-son moment.  I'm like, all right, just beat it.  Beat it.  We get it.  I love you. 
[00:21:00]  You love me.  Night.  Beat it so I can.  Yeah, well, and there it is in Trading Places, just nude to be nude.  And remember Caddyshack, the pool scene?  All of a sudden the girl has to take her top off.  The girl's on some guy's shoulders and she's just topless.  The scene, trust me, I'm not complaining at all, but the scene would have been just fine  with the girl with the bikini on the guy's shoulders, no problem.  But all of a sudden she had to take her top off because that's what you did in movies.  Put your clothes on, dear.  Yeah.  Every movie had topless women. 
[00:21:30]  And they took that away from us, too.  Yeah.  But they give us nude freaking men in Abercrombie and Fetch.  I don't know.  When the hell did this happen?  I don't know.  Why'd they stop?  Best boobie shot, fast times.  Talk about gratuitous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boobie man, best boobie shot ever, fast times.  Just saw it last night.  Yeah, when, what's her name, Phoebe Cates comes out of the pool.  When Phoebe Cates comes out of that pool and that water is misting over her. 
[00:22:00]  Yep.  And she, there is nothing that doesn't look good about that scene until, of course, she  starts kissing Judge Reinhold.  Let's say hi to Dean in Queens.  Dean.  What's going on, guys?  What's up, man?  About two summers ago, I was in there with my niece and nephew.  And one of the managers had come up to me and asked me if I was interested in working  at Abercrombie and Fitch. 
[00:22:30]  And I had told her that I really didn't like sales.  You know, I tried sales before and I didn't like it.  And she wasn't, she told me she wasn't talking about that, that the company was willing to  pay me $50 a day for three days to stand in the front without my shirt on for five hours.  Did you do it?  I did do it.  I did it the first day.  I got the $50 and I felt really awkward.  So the second two days, I didn't, I didn't do it.  Yeah.  It's just, it's just a weird, weird thing, man. 
[00:23:00]  I just don't get it.  Yeah.  I really, I really needed money.  I was trying to save up for my Emperor's Club account.  Yeah.  There you go.  Thank you, Dean.  Let's say hi to Malik, Asbury Park, a war zone at Asbury Park.  What's up, Malik?  Yeah, you know how we do.  Hey, yo, listen, man.  Back in the day, like all the stores in the hood, like VIM, Models, all spots like that,  they were, they were required to hire the prettiest girls that will come into the store applications 
[00:23:30]  because they knew that all the dudes that were hustled, like drug dealers, they were coming to spend money  because they see the pretty girls and go, yo, we got to go spend money in there.  Oh, really?  It was required.  Huh.  Did not know that.  Yeah, but I think it's pretty obvious that most retail stores try to, you know, hire the pretty people.  The beautiful people.  Huge unit.  Thanks, Malik.  Huge unit checking in again.  Oh, boy.  Saying a video store said that Fast Times videotapes, back in the old days, were ruined because they were paused for so long at that moment. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Right when Phoebe Cates unbuckles her swim top there.  This was before computers.  You did what you can.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know.  Oh, hell yeah.  And you know how great pause worked on videotapes.  Right, right.  God, horrible.  I think I have to adjust my tracking.  I think my tracking needs adjustment.  Stupid tracking.  Tracking sucked.  Absolutely.  Sean, North Carolina. 
[00:24:30]  What's up?  You boys were talking about blatant displays of boobies in movies.  The best had to be airplane during the panic scene.  Oh, yeah.  Also, what?  A girl's just topless on a plane?  She runs across the shot in the aisle.  But I think that was a parody of the fact that, you know, they just were fitting in boobs like that, which was pretty funny.  There's a panic scene.  And everyone's panicking.  And this topless girl gets right in front of the camera and just shakes her boobs in front of the camera.  That's it right there.  That's the shot. 
[00:25:00]  And look how nice those boobs are.  It's the shot.  Wow.  Porky's had some nice ones.  Remember Porky's had some very sexy.  Porky's was complete just porn for its day.  Yeah.  Yeah, with the famous peephole scene in the shower where the girls just had no clue about shaving or waxing or anything.  That was just like, it was like they were staring into a caveman's cave.  Those girls were so hairy. 
[00:25:30]  I like to call it the old Mexican cave.  It was horrid.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we take our first break?  Off to a good start.  Let's not forget, it is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Anthony's seeing lots and lots of WOW stickers.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what's going on.  What happened?  They finally decided to start mailing out WOW stickers again?  I hope so.  How do you get WOW stickers?  Does anyone know?  Well, you send a...  Oh, look.  There's the shot.  Look at this.  That's old school chicks. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  Look at that.  That is just a...  That's a blankie.  That one has a toupee.  Oh, man.  Someone put a divot in her lap.  No kidding.  You can hit a golf ball off that and not hurt anything.  No, that's...  Wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, this used to be the thing, though, man.  Every movie just had time to show off to girls for a few seconds.  I guess that's why, you know, it's got a fond place in my heart a little bit because of  the, you know, the age. 
[00:26:30]  I kind of remember turning on Cinema 100, where it was the only cable channel you had,  and they would play these softcore pornos, and all the girls looked like that.  Yeah.  I mean, they all just had no clue.  The razor did not go above their legs or below their armpits.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Looked like they were wearing a sumo wrestler diaper.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are...  Anyway, whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:27:00]  Do we have a central location where these people could send in their self-addressed stamped  envelopes and we send out the WOW stickers, or do we have to depend on each individual  radio station to do the right thing?  Oh, gosh.  And then how do they do it?  Is it on their websites?  I don't know.  It used to be easy.  You just put a WOW on your vehicle.  I know here in New York, you could go to onaradio.com, right?  Yeah.  E-Rock.  And there's a WOW sticker, and okay, so maybe the station you're listening on doesn't have  WOW stickers.  You could get this one at least, and then you could doctor it up, maybe use a Sharpie and 
[00:27:30]  cross out the station logo, or just clip that out.  You'll still have the nice WOW logo.  Yeah, that's all you need.  That the girls love and know.  And when the girls see the WOW stickers on the highways, they will flash you.  The weather's getting nice.  There are a lot of women that will flash you if they see the WOW.  That is an absolute fact.  Oh, yeah.  They're out there.  WOW stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  All we ask, and we've said this for years, just don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of women that will do this on their own.  Actually, I met a couple at Mike Birbiglia's show at Caroline's. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Yeah, they came up from the Virginia area, and they're like, you know, we WOW every Wednesday.  We love the show.  And I'm like, hey, cool, man.  Thanks.  So WOW stickers, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019, right?  Is that this address or the other address?  Oh, my God.  Now that's going to mess up everybody.  I don't know.  Just try to figure out how to get your WOW sticker on your own.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Wake the F up.  Now.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Jim Norton.  Somewhere else.  He had to use the other bathroom.  Is that true?  Well.  Rumor had it.  He asked me what I did in that bathroom, and I told him.  Dropped.  Well, I just told him they were long and wrong.  And he made a face of disgust and walked out and used the other bathroom. 
[00:29:00]  The other bathroom.  Hello, Jimmy.  I noticed that everyone got out alive as far as April Fool's go.  Huh?  No real shenanigans that got anyone in trouble this year.  Doesn't seem like anyone got fired or nothing huge.  Everyone was pretty safe.  And we haven't forgotten about this Denison Callahan at WEEI in Boston.  These dopes. 
[00:29:30]  These pompous asses.  The radio industry has, but we haven't forgotten.  America may have ignored you, but we won't.  No.  I'm sure by now they're getting very, very annoyed by the pests of this fine radio show.  Oh.  Oh, they'll play it one way.  Like, oh, we got two calls.  Wow.  You guys got a big audience.  We got two calls.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You're going to have to do better than that.  Really?  Let me know that you know that is false. 
[00:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  It all started with this dumb thing.  It was 10 years ago yesterday that we did our April Fool's Day prank up there in Boston.  Yeah.  Where we were stupid enough to say that the mayor of Boston, Mayor Menino, kind of died  in a car accident.  Yeah.  In Florida.  We were mocking April Fool's Day pranks.  Yeah, it was so out there.  We pretty much got caught with our pants down.  And I'm amazed to this day that people actually bought into this bit we did up there. 
[00:30:30]  Because we don't even play the audio anymore because it's so hacky and awful.  Yeah.  It's kind of embarrassing to us.  Ridiculous.  It really is.  Ridiculous.  And we listened to this like, who the hell would have believed this?  It's so obvious that it was fake and a joke.  Especially on April Fool's.  But whatever.  What happened, happened.  It made us huge radio stars.  That was the catalyst that led to everything else in our careers, by the way.  Really.  We were just kind of rotting away at that dump station, AAF, in Worcester. 
[00:31:00]  And being paid no money.  Just rotting and rotting and rotting.  And this thing gave us an opportunity here in New York that led to syndication and satellite  radio and TV shows and all sorts of crap.  But Dennis and Callahan decided to take a little shot at us yesterday.  Yeah.  Make him believe they don't know who we are, which is just amazing to me.  So we're out of time.  We can't do our top ten April Fool's jokes of all time?  The mayor's dead. 
[00:31:30]  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  No, the mayor's alive, kicking.  He's happy, healthy.  Out riding his bike every morning at 5 a.m.  I'm not going to give you ten.  I'm going to give you like three or four out of the top ten April Fool's hoaxes of all time.  Whatever happened to those idiots that said the mayor was dead?  They're like working at that McDonald's with the child molester.  Yeah, that's where we are.  Working at McDonald's, are we?  That's where we are.  Yeah, we're not broadcasting in Boston.  Yeah.  You know exactly what happened to us.  You know, we downplay our success, but radio guys in general, we do. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, what I just said was a joke.  I was just being an idiot.  But for the most part, radio guys know exactly what we've done with our careers.  If you're in the business.  If you're in the business, you study the players and you understand who's doing what.  Yeah.  Especially guys that are syndicated all over America.  So the Pets are on it and getting some fine reports that they're getting very, very annoyed at WEEI.  So keep it up, guys.  We got that number there, Eroxy. 
[00:32:30]  This would have been perfect timing to have the phone number right there in front of me.  Because then I could give the number out, and then people could continue to call.  But you were too busy doing who the F knows.  As he types in EEI now.  Way to be on the ball.  Well, fine.  Maybe he was doing something.  What were you doing, Eroch?  Productive.  What were you doing there, Eroch?  Pull that mic over.  I was looking to see if we had more of the AAF news clips that we had from America.  Oh, my God.  You're such a liar.  Ooh, someone. 
[00:33:00]  Who do you think you're talking to?  Who do you think you're talking to?  The boss has a question.  Why would we need more clips?  Oh, well, you were going to that thing there.  You have those two discs next to you.  I was trying to find more.  Which we pretty much decided not to play.  So why would you find more clips that we're not going to play?  Oh, Eroch.  Oh, Eroch.  Why?  Well, you could take out the frustrations we're all having with Eric today. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  By dialing 888-525-0850.  It's the Dennis Callahan show.  They're just pompous asses.  Just make sure you don't use profanity because that will really bother them.  That will ruin their show.  Don't do that.  Yeah.  And if David Hinkley's listening, see that sarcasm, David.  Jimmy used a little of that sarcasm right there.  Something you don't understand, obviously.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  We trashed our old producer on the radio yesterday, you know, badly. 
[00:34:00]  He decided to do an interview with Stepping Out Magazine, which pretty much burns a lot more bridges in this business.  He only had a few bridges left, and he pretty much burned the rest of them.  Burned them all.  By having this article out where he trashes Ant and I, well, mostly me, trashes the company that he's trying to get a job with, with a new type of radio show he's doing.  And I talked to the big guys way upstairs, and I'm like, we're not doing business with this guy, especially after the article he did for Stepping Out Magazine. 
[00:34:30]  So we gave him a good trashing yesterday, and stupid David Hinkley, and I know I use the word stupid a lot, but in this case, I really mean it.  David Hinkley, you are as dumb as they come.  He doesn't understand sarcasm.  You are really a dope.  He just took literally everything that was said on this program yesterday when we read through the article.  Right.  Let me read this article really fast. 
[00:35:00]  Opie and Anthony, morning team on K-Rock yesterday, fired back at Rick Delgado, their former producer for comments he made in the Stepping Out Magazine that hits newsstands today.  Delgado was ONA's producer at N.E.W. when the Sex for Sam debacle went down.  The boys kicked off the radio for two years.  He's out of radio now and not happy about it.  He tells Stepping Out saying, the medium has lost its guts and spark.  As for ONA, he says, Anthony has stayed friendly, but that Opie is basically a jerk. 
[00:35:30]  That's not what Anthony said.  Anthony has not talked to Rick since the last time I talked to Rick, which was right outside on the sidewalk outside this radio station.  Yeah, since you.  You did.  We were both outside, and he came up to us on the sidewalk, and that's when we talked.  And once again, I'll say it, and that's why Rick is a complete phony.  He had the opportunity to say whatever he wanted to my face, to my face, and chose not to.  Chose to just be friendly and cordial.  And that was the last time Anthony talked to him. 
[00:36:00]  David Hinkley didn't understand that yesterday.  Anthony's not in touch with Rick.  I was making light of the fact that he was bashing Opie horribly and then giving Jimmy some jabs about him on the show, Jimmy on the show.  But he had nothing but kudos for me.  So I was saying, well, I kind of like that.  I agree with that statement.  But Hinkley took it as me agreeing with some of what Rick was saying and disagreeing with other things. 
[00:36:30]  And really doesn't care what Rick has to say about him, about me, about the show.  But Hinkley didn't understand that.  He continues.  Yesterday, Opie called Delgado a liar and a lousy producer.  Anthony, I didn't even call him a lousy producer, if you want to be fair with this whole thing, David.  No.  Because I'm pointing out everything.  You even got Dad wrong.  I said he was a good producer.  He wasn't the type of producer we wanted when we brought our radio show back after almost two and a half years. 
[00:37:00]  I didn't say he was a lousy producer.  I didn't say that.  You have to rephrase that because you said he was a good producer.  He wasn't the kind of producer we wanted when we brought our radio show back after that.  We wanted the lousy producer.  I understand who you wanted.  Oh, yeah.  Well, true.  And then it says...  Anthony said some of Delgado's charges are true and some are not.  Anthony did not say that.  I was goofing because I was getting such a...  God, David.  This David Hinkley is just stupid. 
[00:37:30]  Did I even, you know...  And then he writes, all this happened on April Fool's Day.  No.  Well, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  I just missed an opportunity to use my favorite new clip.  Oh, you got a new clip?  Yeah.  Can I hear it?  Even though it won't mean anything?  It won't mean anything.  It's like...  Well, read that again.  Delgado's charges are true and some are not, Anthony said.  When the hell did this happen?  When the hell did this happen?  It's my new favorite Back to the Future clip. 
[00:38:00]  I know.  You guys have been obsessed with that in the office.  You just have been laughing in the office.  When the hell did this happen?  In the office earlier today.  And then it goes on to say...  Michael J. Fox yelling at his hand as it moves.  All this happened on April Fool's Day, of course, when O&A have a history of occasionally  putting people on.  What does that mean, David?  I think he thought it was some kind of a gag.  But it's not a gag.  We're responding to an actual interview that is coming out. 
[00:38:30]  You think we all got together and came up with that wacky bit?  Elsewhere yesterday, Tom Taylor's RadioInfo.com said CBS may be leaning toward re-upping O&A,  whose deal expires this month.  When the hell did this happen?  Really?  That's an interesting tidbit in the paper today.  Yeah.  That's not going to make the Manatees too happy in Boston because they think they know everything.  Dopes in the inside track.  So, David Hinckley completely getting it wrong. 
[00:39:00]  I just give up.  I mean, people, why even try to sound intelligent and get your thoughts together if people don't  understand what you're saying?  Yeah, I would think he...  He's a radio guy if he's not understanding.  He would understand that bit of sarcasm, but...  All right.  Speaking of April Fool's, did you guys hear what Hillary did?  Did you guys hear what Hillary did?  She looked at a picture of a penis and pretended she liked it. 
[00:39:30]  Instead of throwing it on the ground, stomping on a...  Masculating it and stomping on it, Jimmy.  She had probably the best April Fool's joke of the day.  And there were a lot of good ones out there.  Listen to what Hillary did.  She's very funny.  Showing Jimmy she has a sense of humor.  Ready for this?  Mm-hmm.  Hillary Clinton pulls an April Fool's Day prank during a news conference in Philadelphia  yesterday.  When the hell did this happen? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, oh, it was yesterday in Philly.  Oh, crap.  Jimmy Olsen.  Let me tell you something.  I'm really happy you finally got a new clip.  It's taking about six months.  I'm so glad they're producing for you.  I'm going to burn it out.  Oh, my God.  In one hour.  That one's going to drive me nuts.  I know already.  We've just been laughing our ass off at Back to the Future.  And Back to the Future 2.  But that, by the way, that man was not always on the bottle. 
[00:40:30]  Well, because Opie had that cologne before, and then he sees the man's picture on the  bottle, and he's like, when the hell did this happen?  Yeah, because it wasn't there.  Corbat!  Corbat!  I think it's a little louder than all of your other clips.  Yeah, no kidding.  I had to turn down his pot.  It's louder?  Yes.  When the hell did this happen?  It shouldn't be.  If you're keeping track at home, I got you at 70% on the board.  Oh, okay.  70%.  You're usually at a full 100, but I pot you down to the mix a little bit. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, okay.  Just a little bit, a little bit.  Listen to what Hillary did for April Fool's.  Hillary Clinton pulls an April Fool's Day prank.  During a news conference in Philadelphia yesterday, Clinton had a very somber attitude and appeared  like she had something very important to announce.  She challenged Barack Obama to a bowl-off.  Winner take all.  I'll even spot him two frames.  It's time for his campaign to get out of the gutter and allow all of the pins to be counted. 
[00:41:30]  She's so deadpan.  Her face is so serious.  April Fool's speech came after Obama's poor performance at a Pennsylvania bowling alley.  In seven frames, he bowled just 37.  37 in seven frames.  Wow.  He's awful.  If she was in the bowling alley, he'd probably roll the ball and hit her calves. 
[00:42:00]  Yuck.  Stop trying to be funny.  She's not funny.  She's just awful.  That's like us trying to make policy.  You don't see us trying to make policy.  Just stop.  No one listens.  She thought that would be...  It's hysterical.  It's bowling humor.  She made some bowling jokes.  It's great stuff.  But she's like, he's got to get his campaign out of the gutter.  Out of the gutter, Jimmy!  How about this?  Barack Obama should have some balls. 
[00:42:30]  I like that one.  He was throwing gutter balls.  It was really funny to watch.  Yeah.  What made him go bowling badly?  Who talked him into that?  Politicians don't go bowling.  Yeah.  Pick a sport that he knows.  Basketball or something.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Everybody knows Barack doesn't bowl.  Everyone knows he does play a little hoop.  Probably doesn't swim.  I wasn't even going racist on that.  I've seen the pictures. 
[00:43:00]  He gets into a nice pickup game every once in a while.  Yeah.  So why would you...  You're right.  That can't help you to bowl 37 in seven frames if you want to be the president of the United  States of America.  No.  Waterheads do better than that.  Yeah.  It makes you just look like you don't have any hand-eye coordination.  And also, you know, it's not cool that he didn't go all the way.  See, like, you know...  Yeah, he didn't finish.  He didn't finish.  He didn't finish the job.  So basically you're saying you're not going to finish the job when you're the president  of the United States of America.  He's just going to go seven frames of a ten-frame policy or a foreign policy, maybe? 
[00:43:30]  I don't know what that means.  I don't know.  But it means he's not going to finish.  It's a middle-class white thing to do.  White people bowl.  That's why he's doing it.  True.  It's very...  It's a very, you know...  Very calculated, right?  Yeah.  It's kind of a white family thing to do is go bowling.  Yeah.  So white people were able to watch and laugh along as he just went gutter ball after gutter  ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's okay.  In other Hillary news, she had this to say. 
[00:44:00]  This is our Hillary break.  Look, I know there will be hurdles and setbacks between now and November, but I also know  I'm ready.  I know what it's like to stumble.  I know what it means to get knocked down.  But I've never stayed down.  I never will.  Or went.  And neither will you, and neither will America.  We're on the comeback trail as a country.  When the hell did this happen?  On the comeback trail.  She cannot sound less sincere. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, she's panicking.  In that clip.  Do you just hear that little...  She puts that fake laugh in.  Yeah.  That little titter that she puts in her voice.  Obama's pulling away at this point.  He's pulling away.  That clip continues with this, which I find just amazing.  And I think a lot of people will understand why this was a dumb thing for her to say.  Senator Obama says he's getting tired of the campaign.  His supporters say they want it to end.  Well, could you imagine if Rocky Balboa had gotten halfway up those art museum stairs 
[00:45:00]  and said, well, I guess that's about far enough.  It's not the way it works.  Let me tell you something.  The conversation is the fight.  Rocky and I have a lot in common.  I never...  Yeah, he used to hit your legs in the first one to warm up.  As you hung in a meat locker.  Punch your fat, thick legs.  Rocky and her have a lot in common.  Hold on.  Before...  Did Adrian use a cigar on an intern? 
[00:45:30]  You know, when Hillary's having Chelsea, she grabbed her stomach and fell in a feed bag?  Did Bill have a hair lip when you met him?  How does that work?  You ready for the big reveal?  Rocky and her had a lot in common.  A lot in common.  Here we go.  Can't wait.  Let me tell you something.  When it comes to finishing the fight, Rocky and I have a lot in common. 
[00:46:00]  I never quit.  I never get up.  And I know that we're going to make it together.  Not just up those stairs.  But we're going to climb that mountain to a better day for America.  Here's the problem.  What does that mean?  Does anyone understand the problem with this clip?  Yeah, she sucks.  Besides that?  Well, the part where she goes, I'm not getting up.  I never get up.  I never get up.  Yeah, first of all, that means you're going to be staying down on the canvas.  But you shouldn't reference Rocky and the first movie because Rocky lost. 
[00:46:30]  You dope.  You don't even know movies.  Rocky did lose that one.  How about Rocky and I have a lot in common.  We both like being hit by muscular black man in the face.  And we both used to break knuckles for a man named Gazzo.  Gazzo.  Stupid Gazzo.  Rocky and I have a lot in common.  We're both fighting a...  What the hell, man?  That's hilarious. 
[00:47:00]  But you can't reference the first Rocky movie.  Rocky lost, you idiot.  God.  But let's...  I react to certain substances the way he reacted to those raw eggs.  Hold my nose and gulp.  Anthony?  Yes?  You thought I forgot.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand. 
[00:47:30]  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, then on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance.  She'll make it.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be your president.  When the hell did this happen?  Hillary Clinton.  I don't want to turn her back now.  Yeah.  Straight ahead and on the track.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With plans to make our dreams come true. 
[00:48:00]  Your Lord Jesus is ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This can't be happening.  Never heard the word impossible.  That's my favorite part.  There's no fun for her.  She's going to do it.  There she is.  On your mark, get set and vote now.  Vote now.  Got a dream in love.  Shut up.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  True.  Working for us all day. 
[00:48:30]  Yes, all day.  There she is.  Make all our dreams come true.  Working for us all day.  Oh, good morning, Damon.  Make all our dreams come true.  Come on.  For me and you.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're changed for nothing.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  I wanted...  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Yeah, that's about the size of it. 
[00:49:00]  And that concludes our Hillary Clinton segment of the program today.  We're both fighting.  I'm sorry.  She can't even get that right.  Both of these dopes.  He's bowling and bowling a 37.  Yeah, in seven frames.  That's not going to impress anyone.  And she's referencing a movie where the star loses.  God.  This is a horrible joke. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  A horrible bowling ball joke.  Is it really?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  No, I'm not going to say it.  Oh, no.  We're going to go...  We're going to put the music on and I want to hear it now.  I'm thinking about why he only bowled a 37.  And perhaps he didn't want to throw the ball hard.  That's all.  What?  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  All right.  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony program in a mere few seconds. 
[00:50:00]  What is wrong with you?  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Are you crazy?  What the hell is wrong with you?  I've never heard that one before.  Yeah, that's an old joke.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a different setup to it, you know, but it's about bowling balls. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Eggs, huh?  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I know what you want.  Bip, bip, bip.  Look at that boom.  My God.  They're giant.  Let that turn you on.  Whip about Wednesday.  You have never read my feedbacks on the air.  I just would like to, I just would like to, if it gets through or not. 
[00:51:00]  Big Chris.  And I just read that word for word.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the problem, Chris.  You wrote, you have never read my feedbacks on the air.  I just would like to, if it gets through or not.  Hmm.  What word is left out?  I don't know.  It's not a contest.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I want to bring it to your attention.  There's a website called rochesterinsider.com.  Rochesterinsider? 
[00:51:30]  No.  What?  Rochesterinsider.  Oh.  Dot com.  That's different then.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Yeah.  Because she would have to be a whore.  Well.  Did all of Rochester.  Yeah.  Of course, Rochester, the home of Brother Wheeze.  We're on a radio station called The Zone.  For how long?  Who knows?  I don't know if we have a relationship with that radio station, do we?  I hope so. 
[00:52:00]  I hope so, too.  I want to be heard in Rochester.  I did a lot of time in Western New York,  so I want some old friends to hear the old voice.  But they're doing a, remember, Anthony, the March Bracket Brawl?  Opie, how could I forget the March Bracket Brawl  that was done here at our New York station,  our flagship station, K-Rock, here in New York City.  Wow.  What an event.  It made the newspaper, I hear. 
[00:52:30]  Made the newspaper.  Metallica beat out Zeppelin.  Oh, my goodness.  Metallica beat out Pearl Jam to take the title.  Well, the research has finally come back.  Oh, yeah, really?  On that promotion.  And this is all the people that joined the radio station  after hearing March Bracket Brawl.  All right.  That's not a lot of people over there.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Can we just be team players for once? 
[00:53:00]  Why?  Are we going to start now after 13 years?  No.  Why?  I will say this.  Just for once in my dumb career, I want to work for a healthy radio station.  Is that asking too much?  And I'm not talking about the syndicated stations.  I just want the flagship station that we're on to kick ass.  For once.  To be like the powerhouse.  Like, you just drive around the city, and you can't avoid billboards and our faces.  Oh, it's just huge.  And the logo. 
[00:53:30]  We work for a lot of assholes.  We certainly do.  We're brought in as that S-hole anchor.  And then we're looked at as the A-holes because we make fun.  But I don't think we've ever worked for a healthy radio station as far as the flagship station goes.  Yeah.  We work for the Patrick Swayze radio stations.  They're just about ready to drop, Ted.  Yeah.  The radio stations we work for lose listeners faster than Patrick Swayze loses pounds. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Oh, that.  I love what they're playing on the station now.  No, they're doing all right.  I mean, I love it.  I heard Sabbath last night on the station.  I love it, too.  They're trying their fifth format in two years.  That's terrific.  Maybe this one will work.  That's a good way to do it.  You put it on for a week, and all of a sudden you go, nobody's listening, Jason, immediately.  I can't keep track anymore.  I actually did a little of that spring cleaning, Jimmy, and I went through my T-shirts.  I noticed I had too many T-shirts.  I have radio station T-shirts with logos and sayings on them from this radio station, and 
[00:54:30]  I couldn't keep track.  Yeah, I have so many radio station T-shirts.  I'm like, I can't wear this shirt anymore.  This was the format three formats ago.  Yeah.  They're actually good to use as a f***ing rags.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Very nice.  Very good.  You find an old station with an old logo on it, and just f*** right into it. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I love how you have to mouth the words.  Well, it gives us that authenticity.  Yeah.  Sometimes you'll hear the last letter.  No, well, they're moving in the right direction here in New York.  Yeah.  Rochesterinsider.com is kind of doing a March bracket brawl, Anthony, and I know how much you  love these brackets things.  Well, I hope Hinkley writes that I really love the bracket brawls and doesn't catch an 
[00:55:30]  ounce of sarcasm in my voice.  Right.  No, the only one we enjoy so far was what Toucher and Rich are doing.  Yeah.  With the unfunniest comic thing.  That was very original and different.  That was good.  And Rochester, they're doing Rochester Radio Madness.  Rochester Radio Madness.  And if you go to rochesterinsider.com.  That's using the madness part.  Oh, yeah.  The March Madness.  See, we used the March bracket brawl.  So we had March in there. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  But not madness.  No.  And now they're using the madness.  Coming soon to our show, April Craziness.  Right.  April Craziness.  Dan's working on it.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  When are we going to do April Craziness?  Starting tomorrow, maybe?  I think the first round will be tomorrow, yeah.  All right.  First round tomorrow.  Make sure you tune in because it's crazy.  Oh, it's...  Well, of course.  It's April Craziness.  It's unbelievable.  March Madness just sets up for April Craziness.  We're going to start a trend where we expect every radio show in America to do April Craziness.  Yes, get away from that dumb March Madness. 
[00:56:30]  And then I'm hoping for May retardation where it just completely goes off the scale and we become blithering idiots.  You missed the obvious.  What?  May mayhem.  May mayhem.  Now we got to do something for June.  June.  June.  June.  June.  June.  The June.  The June.  Very nice.  June bug out.  Oh.  A June bug.  Boo! 
[00:57:00]  So, RochesterInsider.com.  They're doing Rochester Radio Madness.  And guys, I'm proud to announce that we're in this competition and we beat a show called Casper in the first round.  Casper?  And we are right now taking on the Morning Coffee Club.  What?  The Morning Coffee Club.  What is that?  Look at the picture of the Morning Coffee Club.  They are the three most killable people I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:57:30]  Look at that pig.  Oh, here it is.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Okay.  Wow.  Boy, does she have a voice for radio, this one.  The Morning Coffee Club.  Terry Clifford.  Oh, my God.  Look at this pig.  Whoa!  Whoa, look at Terry Clifford.  And she's a flatso.  She's a flatso, which is the worst thing a fat chick can be, is flat.  Yeah.  Good idea, getting a perm on top of your fatness. 
[00:58:00]  She looks like Del Griffin.  Wow.  Yeah, she does.  This could be the most despicable woman I've ever seen in my life.  Well, Terry Clifford.  Wow.  Terry's tidbits.  We're trying to get to know.  Those are on her chest.  Oh, the fat went to the wrong places, didn't it, honey?  We're taking on the Morning Coffee Club in this Rochester Radio Madness competition,  so we want to get to know Terry Clifford.  Do we? 
[00:58:30]  Obviously, the cornerstone of the radio show.  Cornerstone of a building.  Right.  Well, that's called a setup.  Yes.  I feel a little bounce pass there.  Nice layup, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Well, and thank God that we're taking on the Morning Coffee Club,  because the Morning Coffee Club was up against Late Nights with John Tesh,  and if we were up against Late Nights with John Tesh and lost,  that would be very embarrassing for our careers.  Oh, it would be.  So we're taking on the Morning Coffee Club and Terry Clifford. 
[00:59:00]  Wow.  Look at her.  You want to read about Terry Clifford for us, Jimmy, today?  The listeners are going to be able to get a picture of her.  I guess.  We can throw it up on onaradio.com later today.  This is so heinous.  Yeah.  I really am stunned.  Well, in the picture, there's three of them.  There's a guy, a slender gentleman wearing a flannel shirt,  making kind of like a, uh-oh, like a wacky face, uh-oh face,  and behind him with her hand on his...  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I just have to jump in, because I have a little experience in radio, 
[00:59:30]  and I'm just by the face in the flannel shirt.  I'm thinking he's the crazy one.  Yeah, he's going to be, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  And the two people behind him, it's almost like picture a guy in the middle  and two people behind him, each leaning one arm on his shoulder,  like a family portrait.  Yeah.  And they're both fat, and the fat woman has a jovial look on her face,  which she should not have.  And that's Terry Clifford, and the other guy, I don't know who he is.  You know why?  Why?  Someone's ready to throw a sardine in her mouth. 
[01:00:00]  Well, all right.  Now my joke sucks.  I was going to say that the camera guy kind of has some donuts,  and he's kind of flashing to get her to smile like that.  I went with the walrus joke.  And I would have said she's smiling like she just bit Bo Derek's leg off.  What?  I like that.  What a mess.  I can't get enough of this Terry Clifford now.  She's great.  And the guy in the middle with the big ears, uh-oh, uh-oh.  With huge ears, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, he's horrendous.  Anyway, we're beating them right now 46.2%, and we have 53.8%.  That's it?  Those numbers will change drastically in the next hour or so.  Yeah, I think so.  Terry Clifford.  What do we know about Terry Clifford there?  She's fat.  Oh, she's awful.  And she has what looks like a curly version of Gene Simmons wig on.  Terry Clifford is zilcho number one.  Working at WBEE is truly a labor of love for me. 
[01:01:00]  I was originally hired in October of 1984, three years out of college,  one small market radio station under my belt.  Jesus, you could fit 18 major markets under your belt.  Yeah.  She worked at 1240 AM WGVA in Geneva, New York.  Little known fact, I got my radio start in Geneva, New York,  at a fine station called CQ102 Hit Music and More.  This bio, it's so awful you can't even be funny with it. 
[01:01:30]  No.  Yeah.  Here's the one line she goes for a joke.  Well, could you continue, because I want to comment about the next line.  She graduated college in 81.  Her first gig was at WGVA in Geneva, New York,  and then she was ready to conquer Rochester.  Ready to conquer Rochester.  22 plus years later, I'm still working on that.  Wow.  Jesus.  Give it up.  Give it up.  The only person that should be proud to be doing 20 plus years in Rochester radio would 
[01:02:00]  be Brother Weed, because he is like a monster.  He is a monster.  So is Terry Clifford.  Right.  Well, she's the Cloverfield monster.  Jimmy, come on, man.  She wants to conquer Rochester by knocking down buildings.  Yeah, exactly.  Anyone else that has spent 22 years in Rochester radio, and I love Rochester, I go up there  two or three times a year easily, should kill themselves. 
[01:02:30]  Kill themselves.  So she's still working on that, Jimmy.  What else you got here?  I don't know.  There's nothing else.  I have worked every air shift imaginable through the years, along with a number of other jobs  around the station, but none that I love more than the Bee Morning Coffee Club.  I have worked with, and for some, of the best people the business has to offer.  Who cares?  Who cares?  For those of you who have listened for a while, should be for both of you, you'll remember  the likes of K.B. 
[01:03:00]  Cooper, Coyote Collins, and of course the unforgettable Bill Coffey.  Bill Coffey.  Is that why the show's called Morning Coffee Club?  It's like the drink, only spelled different.  Well, the next line...  Only the hijacker.  Only luckier, because you don't have to listen to this fat pig.  That was cool.  I'm sorry.  Whatever.  The next line...  I got it.  The next line in this bio could go either way. 
[01:03:30]  It could get either a really big laugh, or it could make people very sad.  I think it would get a laugh.  That's up to you to decide.  Yeah.  Who are we to decide that for you?  Bill Coffey.  He was my coworker, my mentor, and one of my best friends.  His sudden death...  His sudden death on Monday, December 6, 2004...  When the hell did this happen?  Oh, it was December 6, 2004.  Sorry. 
[01:04:00]  ...left a hole in our staff, and my heart the size of the Grand Canyon.  Okay.  Start writing.  All right.  At the funeral, I collapsed and left a similar-sized hole in the floor.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  We like exaggerated humor, but if you have a hole in your heart the size of the Grand Canyon,  that doesn't leave a lot of room for the blood to continue pumping. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  She really could have used a hole in her stomach.  Who put that in their bio?  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then it says, uh...  Blah, blah, blah.  Whom from...  Wait.  I will forever be grateful to Steve Hausman, who from December 7th...  Oh, December 7th is very special to her.  That's when the Japanese bombed her. 
[01:05:00]  Eh, whatever.  We're up against this show called The Morning Coffee Club.  Go to rochesterinsider.com to check it out for yourself.  All the great shows in there.  Wow.  Mike Danger.  I am one lucky lady, she says.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you?  Really?  Wow.  Um...  Luck B in Elephant.  Tonight!  All the shows we're going to have to take out to take the title. 
[01:05:30]  We're going to have to take out Mike Danger.  We're going to have to take out The Wake Up Club.  We're going to have to take out Morning Drive with Gately and Julie.  And Wesley is World.  Whatever the hell that is.  What is that?  I don't know.  Wow.  There you go.  So we're in a bracket thing.  Yeah.  Rochester Radio Madness.  Wow.  Brr.  Look at Terry Clifford.  I'm obsessed with her.  Oh, totally.  She's all I want to think of today.  She is horrible. 
[01:06:00]  Look at those arms.  Dude, I can't get over this picture.  I bet she's got double ass.  You ever see fat women that have the ass in the middle of their ass?  You ever see fat women that have the ass in the middle of their ass?  It's like a separate ass.  Because the panties aren't that big.  Yeah.  So they kind of bunch up and squeeze part of the fat into a smaller, like, quato from Total  Recall.  Sure, sure.  It's like quato ass.  You got a little butt growing out of the big butt there. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, I bet Terry Clifford's got that.  Her hair is, you know what it looks like?  It looks like a walk with an afro.  It's curly and completely wholish.  A walk with an afro.  It looks, I think it looks more like cotton candy myself.  It's very hobbitish.  I think she cuts her own hair in the mirror.  She has hair like Herb Tarlick. 
[01:07:00]  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Jared.  Eat the sandwiches.  Jared.  What's up, Jared?  Hey.  Way to take on those hard targets, you bunch of nudges.  We're nudges.  Oh, it's making you laugh, though.  Let's be honest.  Oh, she's what she is, you know?  I mean, I'm a flatso.  I love flatso.  Flatso.  It's the curse of a fat woman.  Being fat with no boobies. 
[01:07:30]  The flatso.  God bless.  Rosie O'Donnell's the classic flatso.  The classic.  Oh, yeah.  Classic.  Just huge with no breasts to speak of.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tanner in Fargo.  Tanner?  What?  Boy.  Herb Tarlick's picture.  Yeah.  What's up, Tanner?  Hey, guys.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, good.  Where are you?  Up by the lake?  Yeah.  Huh?  You did this to me last time I called.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that every time you call.  What do you think? 
[01:08:00]  Hi there.  How are you?  Okay.  Right.  Okay.  Right here.  Hi.  Right here in Brainerd.  Why don't we take care of it here in Brainerd?  No.  Right here in Brainerd.  You know, Brainerd?  Let me tell you something, Tanner.  You should go with that true coat.  That's my deal, Wade.  Hey, those are some sweet numbers there, Tanner.  What a dick that guy was.  Sweet numbers.  Just took his deal away from him.  I'm not a bank. 
[01:08:30]  I'm not a bank.  Miserable bastard he was.  That's my deal.  Come on, Wade.  Such a super lady.  I'm going to watch that movie again.  Well, you just have to tell me what you need for your finder's fee.  Finder's fee?  No, I need all the money, Wade.  You're darn tootin'.  Hey, I'm cooperating here.  Yeah, okay.  Someone is suggesting that this Terry Clifford looks a lot like Babe Ruth. 
[01:09:00]  Babe would have grown his hair out a little bit.  Go ahead, Tanner.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  I missed you in Minneapolis.  Oh, thanks.  Because I'm such a big stalker of you.  But anyway, I was...  Were you over the Radisson?  Should have seen me on stage.  I was funny looking.  Dude, you got to see the color picture of Terry Clifford.  Oh, God.  Hold on, I'm sorry.  Wow.  Black and white makes her look... 
[01:09:30]  In a general kind of way.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hold on, buddy.  She's wearing...  Terry Clifford, we were looking at a photo of her in color, and she has on glasses, and  she's with two guys, and she has white gloves on.  She's wearing two white gloves.  Why?  Because she's holding an Oscar, and I guess it must be a real Oscar.  That's why the white gloves, so you don't mess it up with all the greasy fingers that  she has.  Oh, I'm sure.  All the fried chicken she's eating.  Chicken and whatever the hell else she's eating.  That's great. 
[01:10:00]  The white little glove.  She looks like a panda.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  All right.  That hairdo is wonderful.  Atrocious.  Yeah, she looks like the rental car lady in planes, trains, and automobiles, but fatter.  Fatter.  And John Candy.  Could you move down to her white gloves?  Yeah, let's see the white gloves.  We've got to get these pictures up.  Why is she wearing white gloves?  Oh, because she is holding an Oscar. 
[01:10:30]  No, she is, and I'm sure they don't want the grease on the damn thing.  Yeah, put these gloves on.  They probably make her do that whenever there's stuff around, so she can't be picking up little  chocolate things.  I'll look at her fingers and see if she's been eating.  You've been eating, haven't you?  The insurance company makes her do that.  She checks on her and see if there's grease on her gloves.  You got morning coffee club audio, Danny?  Oh, Danny.  Thank God.  Tanner, you better hurry up, because we got morning coffee club audio.  This is the radio show we're up against in Rochester Radio.  I forgot the name of the contest already. 
[01:11:00]  Brackets?  Bracket, madness, craziness.  Insanity.  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay, with my job, I can only listen to the show at night, so I was just listening to  yesterday's show, and around the end, when you were talking about Derrickson Callahan,  I decided to call them up, because they're on right now, and I played some of your audio  for them, and they listened for four minutes, and then hung up, and then I rolled it back  to when you boys were talking about how well you've done for yourselves.  So I called back, and I played that for them. 
[01:11:30]  Well, cool, because they were the ones that took the shot yesterday, and they said, whatever  happened to them guys?  That's right.  And then after you said XM, I paused it, and I said, does that tell you where they're at?  And the young man, or whatever on the screen caller, said, dude, you're such an effing  loser.  Right.  But yet you got through twice in a row immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, we really, I got to tell you guys, we really want this battle in Boston. 
[01:12:00]  We're definitely going to hit EEI hard, and one of these guys, I know a little bit about  him.  He will absolutely crack and say some horrific things, which will be just horrific.  Will he really?  Oh, he will crack.  Why?  He's just a pompous ass that can't imagine anyone not liking him.  Oh, he will crack.  Oh, we got Jim Jeffries here today.  Awesome.  I forgot that he was coming in.  Great guy, man.  Very funny guy.  All right.  Hey, Tanner, thank you.  Yep. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Bye.  She's wonderful.  Do we have time to play Coffee Club Audio?  We're confusing everyone.  Please, Opie.  We pretty much take on the whole radio industry every morning.  Let's just be honest.  And now we're in a bracket thing against this coffee club, is that it?  In Rochester.  We made fun of Scott from Scott and Todd yesterday, because he sounds like he's talking with loose  teeth.  Can we play that audio from yesterday again?  That made me laugh all night.  That was really good.  We'll play it after the break.  What happened to him?  Oh, rock face.  We're taking on EEI in Boston.  We're all over the place, so just try to keep focused here. 
[01:13:00]  This is a show we're up against, I guess.  Do they even, oh, they're on in mornings, and we're on like, we have a horrible time  slot, by the way, in Rochester.  I've been fighting that for a long time.  Two to five?  That's prime time.  Two to five stinks.  You want to get people in their cars.  It's all about getting people when they're in their cars.  Two to five stinks.  And I lived in Rochester.  I mean, the commute is really short, and they're not commuting at two in the afternoon.  No.  Morning Coffee Club, here's some audio of the show we're taking on. 
[01:13:30]  Rochester Radio Madness.  Hold on to your hats.  7-12 at 92.5 WDB.  Wait, hold on.  Why does she start off with her waist?  Oh, damn, Jimmy.  And that one is out of here.  Wow.  By the way, just remember, you're listening to a fat pig.  I mean, the voice sounds like, wow. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, look at everyone on Pal Talks going, swimwalk.  Swimwalk.  Swimwalk.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  You deserve a swimwalk.  You deserve a swimwalk for that.  Very good.  Swimwalk.  Um, she's got the sexy voice, but it's radio.  Sexy voice equals...  Uh, slob.  Equals weight.  Yeah.  More weight.  7-12 at 92.5 WBEE.  Some sunshine.  Later on today, how to do... 
[01:14:30]  The low 40s were 20.  There'll be some sunshine as soon as I get off the roof.  We're the most juvenile show on the radio dial.  We're doing third grade humor for guys in their 40s.  W-O-B-E-E-S-E.  Rochester is the only city in America that has more eclipses than everywhere else because  of this Terry Clifford. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, she's wonderful.  Oh, she's a gem.  Low 40s.  We're 28 right now.  Tom George, what do you see?  Not bad, Bird.  First off, he's got nothing.  I love you.  No boobs.  What do you see?  Do you really want me to say?  A circus tent masquerading as a dress?  Oh, I love her.  She's all I want to talk about.  She's great.  A month.  Bird, first off, eastbound travel's got sun glare this morning.  All expressways are on time on a dry highway.  Just a handful of power outages from yesterday's windstorm. 
[01:15:30]  Not affecting any traffic signals, we're told.  All right.  According to the post-it notes all over the studio, don't forget the announcement.  It's 7-10.  And now's the time we should make the announcement, which is three minutes off schedule, which is  right on time for us.  So I would like to applaud our punctuality for once.  Hey.  Relatively close.  Thank you very much.  Very nice. 
[01:16:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have the email in your inbox already.  You've seen it on our website.  Your friends, perhaps, have asked you about it.  Maybe you've overheard the cool people that were.  The morning Vicodin Club.  Well, today is the day where we begin to announce the lineup for the 2008 Guitars and Stars showcase  going on early May at the Dome Arena in Henrietta the 7th, right? 
[01:16:30]  Is that him out?  That's it.  Yep.  May 7th.  How odd that he mentions Henrietta and then the hippo pipes up.  Wow.  And the rock and town of Henrietta.  Boy, this show's going places.  Henrietta.  And Henrietta the 7th, right?  Great success.  Yep.  May 7th.  All right.  Hey, cool.  You think I've, you know, all that talking, I know what day we're doing this.  Um. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Now I need to know who's playing at their great concert.  Oh, my God.  I think it's in that.  WBEE.com is the web address.  Just go there.  It's so easy.  It's so fast.  And you're still in plenty of time.  Is it?  Uh, to sign up for the I Love My Country Club.  WBEE.com.  She hits five keys with each fat little chubby finger.  I can't get to a website. 
[01:17:30]  Who's playing at the, what is this, what is this show called?  The Guitars and Stars.  Guitars and Stars.  All right.  Who are the guitars and who are the stars of this big concert?  Country Club.  WBEE.com.  All right.  Which, by the way, is where James Otto will be joining us relatively soon.  Am I right?  Who?  He's supposed to call us, actually, on the phone.  On the phone as opposed to, uh, Tim Cannon's string.  Actually, he was supposed to call us a few minutes ago, but I think I might have given  him the wrong number.  Oh.  I was hoping you wouldn't bring that up and we could be like, hey, what do you like 
[01:18:00]  to call James Otto?  You know, there he's picked the screen off of my, uh, broadcasting.  So, there you go.  That's a jolly laugh there, Santa.  All right.  Cell phone keeps on there.  Hang on.  All right.  You just do the news.  Ah, nice.  Nice.  All right.  Stay tuned.  Jayden Zotto will call us, uh, here in just a sec.  Oh.  You know how many times he's been told?  You have such a great way.  Yeah.  Terry Steven Newman.  Terry Steven Newman.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Why don't we have our voice, guys, sound like that?  I could not imagine having a show like that.  I hate this business.  That does that whole, hey, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, puke, puke, blah, blah.  This is the greatest thing you're going to hear.  And it's the guys and the hole is there and it's just the same formula.  She just laughed over a concert announcement.  Whoa, whoa, slow down a little bit. 
[01:19:00]  Good gravy.  Concert announcement.  There's kids listening.  Whoa, slow down a little bit.  Imagine what a chair smells like.  Jesus Christ.  Probably like the inside of her wig.  It's a lot of New Year's Eves alone.  Like ground zero right in the middle of that chair.  Just has to be.  I just want to put my nose right there and go.  And just see what that is. 
[01:19:30]  See what's going on there.  Oh, they got a big one, though, for this Stars and Guitars.  They got the Zamfir.  So that's very good.  That's a biggie for them.  Just roids hanging down like a spaghetti maker.  You just know she's forcing things.  Yeah.  Awful.  All right, we got to take a break.  I think it stinks.  Oh, it's got to just stink.  Oh, just that musty, yuck, rank, dank, hasn't cleaned up very well in years. 
[01:20:00]  Kind of.  Little arms don't reach.  Yeah.  Look at Terry Clifford getting an award.  She's probably breezing the crap out of that seat.  Getting an award from Barbara Walters for what?  Should be a blue ribbon tie on her.  Yeah, 4-H.  What is that?  New York State Broadcasters Award.  Broadcasters Award.  New York State Broadcasters Award.  She's playing the part of the state. 
[01:20:30]  Well, there's Barbara Walters.  The weird thing about Terry Clifford is that four other morning shows in Rochester actually  have their transmitters on her body.  She is one of the highest mountains in Rochester.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think they have a little contest to smell Terry's chair?  I'm fixated now on the chair.  I want to smell her chair because it's probably so disgusting.  Steal her chair, please.  Yes.  All right, we've got to take a break.  And we've got Jim Jefferies coming in next. 
[01:21:00]  He's great.  He is great.  Love this guy.  I saw him at the Dennis Leary and Friends show that Dennis did.  And we had him on, and he killed, and he's here today again.  Very cool.  So we'll do that next.  Opie and Anthony.  Right back at you.  Opie and Anthony.  In studio, Jim Jefferies.  Jim came in, I don't know, four or six months ago and just killed for us.  And I was telling him off mic that the listeners of this show just have taken to you.  They love you, Jim.  Oh, thank you.  It's very nice.  They talked about you for a long time after you left on all the message boards and stuff. 
[01:21:30]  And Jim Jefferies will be playing Carolines here in New York City Thursday through Sunday.  Tickets available by calling 212-757-4100.  And you've got the MySpace slash Jim Jefferies to get Jim.  Exactly.  Just slash Jim Jefferies, and then that's it, I guess.  There's not much to say, really.  Well, Jim is a very, very edgy.  Yeah.  Very honest.  I wouldn't say that honest.  Honest.  Pretty honest.  Some of the stories you tell on that stage. 
[01:22:00]  You admit to a lot of horrific things that you have done.  Well, yeah, yeah.  I do.  Yeah.  Well, it's the whole truth, the whole truth, and nothing like the truth.  You know, it's 80% true.  And then I just put a few C words in the middle to make it more meaty.  Try to meat it up.  I was just so excited to get in here and actually see a picture of Terry.  Terry Clifford?  Yeah.  Because I was listening in the other room, and I was thinking what she actually looks like.  And the first thing I said when I came in, she actually does look like my mum.  Oh, really?  It's like, it's horrific.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's horrific.  No, my mum's a heavyset woman. 
[01:22:30]  She, uh, yeah, but does she have an awful haircut like that?  She would if she could.  Her bangs are like maybe...  With cancer, it's just falling out.  Oh, Jesus.  You got a mom with cancer?  Not anymore.  Oh, fuck.  My mum, right, this is a fat joke.  It just made me think about it.  When we were kids, right, my mum took me out to the circus, and there was like this elephant  in the Moscow Circus called Gunta.  And from that moment on, like, me and my brothers would refer to my mum as Gunta.  Never to a face, but with sentences like, when's Gunta getting home? 
[01:23:00]  What's Gunta making for dinner?  Don't do that, Gunta will catch you.  And the circus master used to get in front of the elephant and go, up, Gunta, up!  Like this, right?  And one time, my brother was being yelled at by my mum, and she was in a chair, and  she couldn't get out because she's, you know, a big girl, and she was rocking from side  to side, and her head slash neck was getting all red, and we were just laughing at her.  And my brother actually stood in front of her and went, up, Gunta, up!  And still to this day, that's the funniest thing I've ever seen. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  She used to make us get her underwear off the clothing line.  She used to stand up and just swear at us from, like, the window.  And we lived in the same valley where they filmed Skippy, so it was a bit of a hike down  to the clothesline.  And whenever we got her underwear, you know how you fold a flag?  Yeah.  Like, me and my brother would do that thing where you get apart, and you walk together,  and you go, uh, and you put them together and then flip them over.  That's what you did to your mom's underwear.  Oh, wow.  But it was funny, and then she got really angry, and then all you'd have to do is, like, 
[01:24:00]  wave them in the air like you're surrendering.  Yeah.  And she was happy again.  You'd just put it on a stick and surrender?  Yeah.  Wow.  Like I said, Jim Jeffries, perfect for the Opie and Anthony Shaw.  She doesn't have cancer.  She's all right.  Oh, good.  She's got a problem with her lungs, and she's on an oxygen machine.  He's laughing at this.  It's true.  It's true.  She's become more ferocious since she lived through, like, she was going to die, and  she was, like, she was unpleasant then, but then she, yeah, but, like, I went to visit 
[01:24:30]  her in the hospital, and she was, like, dying, so she decided to tell me that, I want you  to know that when I'm dead, in many ways in my life, you've been a huge disappointment  to me.  She said that to you.  She said that to me when she was dying, so you can't really fight with that.  No.  You just go, well, I'll try to be better for the next few days or however long it takes.  But she lived through, so I told her off about that months later.  She can't really yell now with the oxygen thing.  The thing is, she's so fucked, because she never left that block of land without a vehicle. 
[01:25:00]  She never walked off it.  Why did she think you were a disappointment in your life?  I mean, you travel the world doing your comedy.  Yeah, but I, well, no.  She wanted you to be a doctor or something?  One of my brothers is, like, a multi-millionaire, and the other one's a cop, so I can't keep  up with that.  Yeah.  And I'm sure in the whole, you know, of his life, from infanthood into, you know, adulthood.  I wasn't born a traveling comedy.  Yeah, that's a small portion, so I'm sure there was many disappointments growing up. 
[01:25:30]  And plus, you've seen my comedy.  I'm a huge disappointment.  There's only so long you can go on stage going, I take a lot of coke, until eventually she  believes it.  You can't just go, it's a mate of mine.  Yeah, good point.  Good point.  Yeah, right?  You can't go down that road if you're going to be an honest comic.  Oh, that is funny, Jim.  Tragic.  What the hell?  Jesus.  You made me think of something.  Now, it left my brain, unfortunately.  Well, you like the picture of Terry Clifford from the Coffee Club. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, that's how we got started, Terry Clifford's Coffee Club.  She's putting a lot of cream on that coffee.  That's all we are thinking about now.  We're obsessed with this Terry Clifford now that we're part of this Rochester Radio Madness  contest.  Does she have a sexy voice?  She has a very sexy voice.  She has a good radio voice.  She doesn't have one of those sexy radio voices.  But the hotter...  Because she's got a good radio voice.  Usually in radio, the hotter the voice, the fatter the girl is.  Yeah, the amount of time I've gone into radio shows and then think, oh, this girl's doing  right, and then nothing.  Just a mess, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  It's those soft, sultry voices that get you.  Yeah.  And then you look and go, whoa!  What the hell is going on, man?  Someone on Instant Feedback had a great line, but the timing was a little off because we  read it after the bit.  But we were playing the Terry Clifford audio, and you heard the bell in the background?  And someone wrote, well, that's indicating that her snack is ready.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Jim was telling us just before he got on that he was trying to figure out what he  could say on our show because he got kicked off Good Morning, Missouri? 
[01:27:00]  Good Morning.  I was playing Kansas in Missouri, right?  I'm just trying to make sure I was on the right show that I got kicked off on, right?  I went to do Good Morning, Missouri, and it was like Halloween, like the day after Halloween,  and there was just some girl going, so you enjoy Halloween?  You never had Halloween before?  And I just went, well, it was all right.  I didn't get scared.  I thought I was going to see scary outfits.  I saw a lot of slutty outfits.  I got aroused, but I didn't get scared.  And then as soon as I said the word slutty, they took me off.  And I got a big speech being told that you could have said trampy, and everything would  have been all right.  Trampy?  Trampy? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, trampy, honey.  What is that?  Slutty?  Slutty?  Slutty, yeah.  It's not a dirty word.  I go, what if kids hear it?  I go, it's not a swear word, is it?  No.  Is this slutty a swear word?  They call each other sluts in junior high.  Yeah, and what kids...  I do.  What kids are watching Good Morning, Missouri?  None.  None.  What adults are watching Good Morning, Missouri?  Yeah, no one's watching that goddamn show.  I'm banned off the show.  I don't care.  Good Morning, Missouri is a terrible show.  They've got nothing good.  It's run by the Nazis, people. 
[01:28:00]  The Nazis run it.  Well, I might have to tune in.  I kind of like that.  How do you say sushi?  Sushi.  Oh.  No, he was talking about the English.  The English?  And wasabi.  And the sushi.  Sushi?  I've been going to auditions in LA all week, and whenever I go for auditions, I go read  an American accent, and I've been going, I think I'm awesome at it, right?  Yeah.  And they tell me I'm awesome, and then they ring up my agent and tell me, oh, he sucks.  He's no good at all.  Like, he's terrible at it. 
[01:28:30]  Let's hear your American accent.  So they're lying to you?  All right, my American accent, I go, hi, my name's Jim.  I'm from San Diego.  I'm very patriotic for no apparent reason.  I don't know, whatever.  That's good.  That's good.  I was discussing this with Norton on the sidewalk after the show yesterday, because we're big  fans of The Wire, and Prop Joe is a huge character in The Wire, and I'm like, man, he must be  a real gangster in real life, because he's so believable, and he just has it down.  And Jimmy said in the, what, the DVD commentary?  He talks.  He was like, they were wonderful actors.  Oh, really?  Oh, Prop Joe. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, Prop Joe.  Prop Joe might have a little of the, uh...  Yeah, he may.  A little bit, a little bit.  Well, Saeed on Lost is English.  He's English, yes.  And Arabisi, uh, when he was on, uh...  Arabisi from Oz?  Yeah.  He's English.  And so is, uh, the lead in The Wire, uh, uh, Dominic West.  McNulty or whatever.  He's English, yes.  Yeah.  So it's just odd that, you know, you see him, and they're talking with an American accent.  Pete Ledge is Australian.  Ah.  He's dead.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't mean he still lives on. 
[01:29:30]  That was...  In the hearts of Australians.  Was that a big one for Australia?  Ah, he was our Diana.  Yeah.  That and Steve Irwin.  Yeah, I know.  You lost two big ones.  Yeah, that's it.  We're done now.  Yeah.  We don't have anybody.  If you lose, uh, what's his name?  Like, Nicole Kidman better die giving birth or...  She's the only one you got left, right?  Is she giving birth yet?  Uh, I don't know.  No, I think I just saw a picture of her still pregnant.  I don't know.  I think so.  She has so much Botox, you can't tell what's going on with her. 
[01:30:00]  You just don't want to lose the Crocodile Dundee.  He is your classic, uh, older, um, statesman, elder statesman.  I love Paul Hogan.  Yeah.  Paul Hogan's great, man.  He had a funnier show than Benny Hill, if I remember.  He had a really funny show.  The Paul Hogan show.  Oh, we're good at naming stuff in Australia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Paul Hogan show.  Yeah, Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Guess where it is?  Uh, it's over in Sydney Harbour?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sydney Opera House.  Guess what it does?  Yeah, it's very self-explanatory.  Oh, they make it very easy for everybody.  Uh, we got an update from the war front. 
[01:30:30]  Uh, we got Chuck in Massachusetts.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, hey, guys.  No, I just called, uh, EEI.  Uh, it's, you know, I called the board and I said, hey, listen, Denison Callahan wanted  to know whatever happened to Opie and Anthony, and I just went through the, uh, the FM, the  AM terrestrial stations.  I went through, of course, XM, satellite broadcast, all the CBS affiliates, you know, the Citadel,  and the screener said, Denison Callahan were only, it was a joke that, uh, you guys misinterpreted 
[01:31:00]  because they were saying that, uh, look what happened to them now.  Wow.  No, no, no.  They're back.  Oh, boy, that's a backpedal.  Yeah, they're going to have to suffer.  Step it up.  More attacks.  And I'm getting, yeah, I'm getting word that so far they're not acknowledging that pretty  much all our listeners are calling their dumb radio show.  They're not going to acknowledge, but I know a little bit about one of the guys.  One of these guys will completely crack and probably say the most racist things ever.  Who?  Because he, when he snaps, when he snaps, he has out-of-body experiences, and it will 
[01:31:30]  happen, and that is my goal with this war with W-E-E-I.  Ah, I'm sorry.  So keep the phone calls coming.  I would love to get the number out, but I don't think E-Rock's working today.  I didn't even, I didn't hear any irony or sarcasm when they were saying that.  Not at all, because he said, uh, uh, you know, one of those idiots at the McDonald's  with the pedophile.  He wasn't saying, like, yeah, I guess they went away forever.  Yeah.  Oh, we never heard their name again.  McDonald's with the pedophiles?  It was a quote from some radio guy.  I would love to. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, what does he mean by that, anyway?  Like, does he mean the Predator special where the guy showed up twice at a McDonald's?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hey, uh, biggest band in Australia.  Who is it right now?  I haven't lived in Australia for seven years, but, uh, I don't know.  Silverchair.  Um, no, Silverchair's still all right.  Probably Wolfmother or something like that.  Yeah, Wolfmother.  Yeah, Wolfmother's from there.  Love Wolfmother.  That's a good band.  I really like Jet, but they're broken up.  Jet, uh, they're broken up?  I read that somewhere, yeah.  They're, uh, they performed on our show.  They were really cool.  The number is 1-888-525-0850. 
[01:32:30]  Or on your Verizon phone, it's pound W-E-E-I.  Yeah.  That's easy.  And I'm obsessed.  I was doing this all night long.  Um, we're just taking on all these radio shows, Jim, uh, uh, Jim Jeffries.  Bear with us.  Jim Jeffries at Caroline's this week.  Uh, Scott and Todd.  Oh, yeah.  Scott from the Scott and Todd show, I guess, is a legend in this business.  I don't really know why.  Mm-hmm.  Scott Shannon.  And we haven't heard his, uh, voice in a long time.  And I guess he talked about our April Fool's prank yesterday. 
[01:33:00]  And we couldn't believe what he sounds like now.  He doesn't sound like him anymore.  And I was trying to do this voice all night long around my apartment.  This, in case you are a new listener, a brand new listener here on our show, we don't do  April Fool's Day.  Not anymore.  The guy, uh, I, I don't know for sure, but it's pretty obvious that he may have had a  lot of face work done.  And I think it's gotten to the point where he can't, he can't keep, he can't talk.  I can't, I can't open my mouth to pronounce this. 
[01:33:30]  It's affected my speech.  It's, uh, the Botox and the stressy, I got a stressy face.  And my dentures.  That is a denture.  It sounds like it's dribbled, doesn't it?  This guy is doing morning radio in New York City.  And this guy's in small markets just waiting for the opportunity.  But you gotta wait for this guy, I don't know, for the lower part of his jaw to fall off.  We don't do April Fool's Day.  Not anymore.  No.  Is it against your religion?  Is that why you don't do it?  I don't believe it's a question of religiosity. 
[01:34:00]  It's just bored with it?  Well, it's just a little morning.  It's dumb.  Passe.  You know, it's more of a third grade sort of thing.  I just know you guys did a good prank.  Why would they have upset?  I don't know what the prank was.  I just know it was good.  I know someone's got one leg now.  Yeah.  We've been here.  There's people who try to do it in radio.  And sometimes you'll read about them in the newspaper.  Hey, let's tell you about these guys in Omaha, what they did. 
[01:34:30]  They said the mayor was killed in a car accident today.  Yeah.  See, the problem is a lot of those things.  I see.  The problem is there is no problem.  Yeah.  It worked out very well for our careers.  You idiot.  The problem is that you're 75 trying to talk to 15-year-old girls.  And you want to talk about April Fool's Day pranks.  These guys did the hackiest ones out there.  The dumb ones.  Yeah.  Starting today, there's going to be a tax on your pet. 
[01:35:00]  Starting today, the $1 bill is going to be taken out of circulation.  When the hell did this happen?  They did the hackiest of the hack.  Hacky hack.  The mayor was killed in a car accident today.  When the hell did this happen?  I love that.  Not so funny.  No.  Right.  But he didn't say which thing.  It really doesn't take a lot of skill to go on a radio and tell you that the Lincoln  Tunnel has been blown up or shut down or whatever.  People ride. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  You need to stop saying that in case someone just turns in.  And what is your...  Oh, she's got to put the fire out.  Oh, you got to stop saying that.  Lest somebody actually have a moment where they're interested in anything you're saying  for a split second as they're driving.  Oh, the radio hole.  I listen to these shows now just to listen to the hole and it's hilarious.  They will...  They pipe in with their nonsense.  Oh.  Trying to keep it all safe.  Keep it safe.  Keep it safe.  Just a bunch of wet blankets. 
[01:36:00]  Shut up in my mouth.  What's...  My shot is...  He's got this car.  Yes.  Can't open my mouth.  Yeah, you're better.  To pronounce what I'm trying to say.  Can't talk over my dentures.  What is his skill?  Wow, look at that jaw.  Does anyone know his skill?  Is that a picture of that guy there?  Yeah.  Wow, he looks like Rocky Dennis.  He should be pulling pins out of a map.  He does.  Crying, pulling pins out of a map, and sleeping with his head up on a pillow.  Stupid.  You know, like the elephant man trying to comb his hair with the shaving kit. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, the shaving kit.  He just gave him dabbing cologne on his giant neck before the hooker had to kiss him and cry.  I always hated the elephant man.  I always felt guilty at the end of it, because I'm so pretty.  I did.  Like, just a little bit better, but you know.  Wait.  What do you got, E-Rock?  Thang goes, I sent you another photo of Scott Shannon.  Oh, that's the rock man out of Never Ending Story.  Right.  Well.  Or you could actually also punch up any Easter Island statue. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  God, like, what is going on with his lower jaw?  Is it just starting to get ready to fall off or something?  It's stretching out before the big separation?  Yeah, he's done something.  Let's go to Chicago, Kevin.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to tell you, I called EIE yesterday at about 6 o'clock on my way off the floor.  EIE?  EIEIO.  EIEIO.  Whatever.  I called that EIEIO radio show.  No, EIEIO.  Yeah, sorry.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Yeah.  And he's like, at first it was busy. 
[01:37:30]  It took me about five times to get through.  And then when I got through, the guy goes, that was a morning show.  They're doing those.  What are you, 12?  And I said, no, I'm 46.  And he goes, well, you're acting 12.  He goes, somebody's doing your wife while you're doing this.  And he said, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  It gave him a laugh.  See, these guys don't know how to handle us.  If you go to one of our listeners, one of our pests that is calling your show, and say, what are you, 12?  That just makes them happy.  Exactly.  You're giving them more maturity than they deserve.  Right.  It makes them happy. 
[01:38:00]  And I just want to start the Pest Residing in Chicago and Suburbs.  Figure out the acronym for yourself.  Wait, the Pest Residing in Chicago and Suburbs.  Pricas?  And Suburbs.  The mayor just died.  Yeah, it was the mayor.  How about Pest Residing in Chicago, Kill Self? 
[01:38:30]  Well, that's the way it's done.  Well, we were having fun until we took that call.  I didn't even know what happened.  What happened there is this guy called and he completely bombed and took the show off the tracks.  Yeah, he derailed the show.  He put a humorless penny on the track and the train derailed.  We were doing fine on schedule and everything.  Jim Jeffries in studio playing Caroline starting tomorrow through Sunday.  Really funny guy.  I love this guy. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, we love when you come in there.  Oh, thanks.  Can I plug one more thing?  Sure.  Oh, no.  I'm doing the NME Awards on the 25th of next month as well.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  The LA ones, you can go online and watch that.  That'll be fun.  Very, very cool.  I've never presented anything.  It could be a car accident.  I've never been in a car accident.  There you go.  We have a full house today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show starring Jim Norton.  Yes.  Featuring today, Jim Jeffries, who will be at Caroline's here in New York City starting tomorrow night. 
[01:39:30]  And now we've got Jeff Ross as well joining the program.  Hi.  What's up, Jeff?  Feeling really good.  Here we go.  These guys are both talking about how they're going to be in Cleveland soon.  Jeff Ross for the locals will be at Governor's on Long Island tonight.  Yeah.  And then you're going to Cleveland this weekend?  Seattle this weekend and then Cleveland the weekend after that.  Oh, very good.  Because we are live.  I'm going to do my own O&A tour.  Well, we have a big following in Seattle.  What I love about Jim doing his tour right now, we get reports back. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And Seattle's a hotbed of activity for this radio show, which is good to know.  It was really good and Cleveland is fantastic.  Cleveland's huge for us.  Yeah.  There's a great show out there, BJ Shea.  Have you done BJ's show?  No, I'm going to get up there for the first time.  Yeah, it's great.  He would love you.  He would absolutely love you.  I met your boys in Boston this past weekend.  Toucher and Rich?  It was fun, man.  They played clips of you their whole show.  They have no show without you guys.  You know, it's starting to be like, we don't have a show without them because we've been  talking about them a lot this week. 
[01:40:30]  Toucher and Rich afternoons on BCN.  Was Toucher a little under the weather or?  Did he seem a little, I don't know, drunk?  Was Toucher the ugly fat one or the fat ugly one?  Jeez.  I get him confused.  Dude, they were passing you.  They're going to get reports back now.  Dude, they were passing you guys.  Toucher likes his drink and possibly other things.  His name's Toucher?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just checking.  Spitzer.  And Fred Toucher, right?  Fred Toucher?  Fred Toucher, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And he likes to come to work with PJs and sometimes slippers.  Did you see that?  No, but I went in a bathrobe one time.  When you lose my luggage, I always go to these shows in a bathrobe.  My left thing hanging out.  Left thing.  And we're live in Cleveland, so let's make sure you can see Jeffrey Ross soon.  And Jim Jefferies has never been to Cleveland.  No?  Yeah, I'm doing a few of those sort of towns.  I'm doing that and Lander and other places I've never heard of.  I hear Cleveland's nice. 
[01:41:30]  You know.  I hear it rocks.  Who told you that?  I hear it rocks.  It's got the Indians, that little funny little man on the hat.  The Cleveland Indians, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.  I don't understand that.  Cleveland is not.  They're your indigenous people.  You can't name teams after indigenous people.  I never went and saw the Sydney Aboriginals kick a ball.  No?  And people just think that's a comfortable sort of thing.  Oh, we killed most of you, but look at how you kick a ball.  No, you know, I just think that's in poor taste, but yeah, go Indians. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  So when are you going to be there?  I don't know.  Check me MySpace.  I don't know where I am.  I'm in the country just traveling around.  I'm doing Boston and Chicago and Cleveland.  I was just thinking, because maybe I might fly out and see you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I might do that.  You could just come and see me at Caroline's this weekend.  Sounds like we have a frontrunner.  I could just not.  For what?  Sounds like we have a frontrunner.  For what?  Have I been a bad guest of this year or something?  I'm just saying, I'd like to see his act.  I didn't know he was going to be local like that. 
[01:42:30]  So that's all.  All right.  Anthony has taken a liking to Cleveland.  What?  Just say it.  The city?  You do talk about Cleveland a lot off air.  Yeah.  You did it before he was going, you're going to love Cleveland.  Did I say that?  Yes, you did.  Jesus.  And you really did.  You touched yourself and you said you're going to love Cleveland.  MySpace slash Jim Jeffries to find out where he's going to be as well.  All right?  Right.  What happened to MySpace?  It's like nobody needs websites anymore.  No.  No, websites are useless, man. 
[01:43:00]  I have 12,000 friends and 4,000 viruses.  Yeah, I know.  That's pretty good.  You're right.  That damn MySpace.  Don't click on anything because it is a virus.  Did you get your Macy's card?  Your free Macy's card?  I'll tell you about Macy's cards.  If you go into Macy's and you have an accent, you get 11% off.  I get 11% off the whole time I'm here.  What do you mean?  They think you're foreign.  Well, I am foreign, but they're happy to have you in there while you're on holidays. 
[01:43:30]  I'll give you one at the end.  I'll get about four of them.  I'll just keep going back today.  11% off.  Why 11% as well?  Not 10%.  Because we think you guys are suckers.  But the thing is, it's because they know you're on holidays, but you can buy a bed with it.  Or like a television or something.  How big is this holiday going to be?  It's the value of the dollar.  It sucks right now.  Yeah, it's awesome.  So why give me more off?  I'm already ahead.  Yeah, you win.  Why are you pitching?  No, I love it.  That's a good deal, man.  But it's like they don't even check my ID or anything. 
[01:44:00]  They just go, oh yeah, he's got an accent.  There you go.  Wow, I wonder if that'll work.  Go in there and do the sushi guy.  Oh, we got that.  Sushi.  This is why we asked some English.  I'll tell you what regional accent is.  The English reporters that there's this cadence where they've got to go up at the end.  You're doing Scouse there.  You're doing Liverpool.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the whole thing.  That's all Liverpool.  That's Beatles Liverpool.  And then he said sushi.  Here it is.  Sushi is horseradish. 
[01:44:30]  You're most likely to have come across it.  That's the powerful paste wasabi.  Sushi.  It's like an animal attack is about to happen.  That wasabi is lightening over the muffins.  The powerful wasabi.  David Attenborough talks like that.  Isn't that wonderful?  The sushi's and the wasabi's.  Right.  The powerful wasabi to put on sushi.  What?  In this corner, it's the powerful wasabi. 
[01:45:00]  In this corner, mustard.  Who's the president of Zimbabwe?  I don't know.  Yeah, that guy.  Mugabe?  Mugabe?  It's wasabi?  Wasabi versus Mugabe.  But that's actually quite a posh accent.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's got the whole English newscaster thing down.  That equivalent in the United States is the broadcaster that talks like this.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you were having sex.  Yeah.  You came here for sex. 
[01:45:30]  To catch a predator.  Hi, I'm Chris Hansen.  Why don't you sit down, have some lemonade and cookies as the police get ready to pounce  on your child molesting ass.  Child molesting ass?  Child molesting ass.  That's it.  I see you brought some condoms and wasabi.  I had a good idea for reality.  Kids love that wasabi.  That wasabi.  You want to entice a child into your van, have wasabi.  Rub it in their eyes.  It'll take away the pain of other areas.  What?  The pain in their soul? 
[01:46:00]  Yes.  What do you got, Joe?  I was going to say, maybe you just gave me a good idea for a reality show.  You think this will work?  I want to do a cross between to catch a predator and are you smarter than a fifth grader?  First prize, you get to keep the fifth grader.  Who wouldn't watch that?  And if Anthony, if you narrated with that voice.  Oh, that'd be great.  I'm in.  One of the low moments for our radio show, one of our guys got caught in the house.  Yep.  That was a low moment. 
[01:46:30]  It made the broadcast and everything.  We got that clip.  One of the pedos walked into the pedophile house that Chris Hansen has staked out with  the cameras and everything.  Oh, no.  And he sits down and Chris Hansen comes out and gives him the spiel.  And then the guy goes, I love you on O&A.  We're just sitting there like, oh, this isn't good.  That's when you hear, like, all press is good.  Press that is not good.  That's not good.  That one doesn't fall into that category. 
[01:47:00]  Rare exception to the rule.  That should be in the morning promotion.  That should be in the opening.  It really should.  I have to hear it now.  We'll get it.  We'll get it wherever you're at.  They're finding it right now.  Bill.  To get your listener.  Yeah.  Bill in Indiana.  What's up, Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, I was watching the news yesterday, and I just want to tell you guys how you've completely  made me an ass in front of my family.  I'm sitting there watching the news, and it comes on and says that an 80-year-old man  got hit by a tow truck. 
[01:47:30]  When the hell did this happen?  And my entire family looks at me like, what are you laughing at?  And it's like, yeah.  Well, did he live?  Is he okay?  Yeah, he was okay.  All right, thank you, sir.  We got the clip that we were just referring to.  Chris Hansen.  All right, we'll start with this, I guess.  We'll start from the beginning. 
[01:48:00]  Do you want some brownies?  I made some.  What?  Did you dose them?  What?  Did you dose them?  No.  I've got to have them before.  Did you bring a sock?  Can I just roll it up wherever?  Yeah.  Let's check it out.  Let's check it out.  He wants the decoy to smell the marijuana he brought.  Smells good.  All right, I'm just going to go get something to drink.  Oh, okay, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I just got it.  It gets me every time. 
[01:48:30]  If that girl walks away and says, I got to go get something, what is happening in your  mind?  You're just like, oh, no.  Oh, here it comes.  This isn't going to be Alan Funt.  Is this a TV show over here?  Is this something that you guys set up?  TV show.  It's a TV show here where Chris Hansen is a reporter.  And it's going to catch a pedo.  Yeah, to catch a predator.  And they set up a house with cameras all over the place.  And they get on the web with this decoy that is acting like a 15-year-old girl or a 14-year-old 
[01:49:00]  girl.  And they get invited to this house.  They show up.  And there's this decoy girl who's actually over 21.  But she looks really young.  And she never gets close enough to the guy.  She's always like, OK, come on in.  And then the guy walks in.  And he's a little, you know, tentative there at the door.  And she goes, OK, just sit down right here.  I'm going to go and change.  And I'll be right back.  And that just lets you know, oh, no, this is bad.  I've been caught.  I'm going to have to change my ways in this country. 
[01:49:30]  I didn't know that show existed.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I've been living in Britain.  I've been fired.  Isn't it weird, Jeff?  It's a very popular show.  This is what it would be like hanging out with someone that just woke up from a coma.  Yeah.  I can't believe you just described that show to somebody.  How to describe the Catch a Predator.  Oh, it's a huge show here.  It's massive.  People love watching pedophiles get caught.  Yeah.  But you've got to know.  And the show's popular enough now where these guys.  Is there spinoffs or anything?  They know.  Down syndrome. 
[01:50:00]  People had to catch a frisbee or something.  Kim Norton does all the casting of the young girl.  If she has to leave the room, follow that bitch.  I'm going to get a drink.  I'm going with you.  Coming with you.  Sorry.  No, your next line should be, I'm going home.  Well, they try, but the cops are waiting outside also.  Yeah.  So they come in.  They talk to Chris Hansen.  Well, they used to let him get away, right?  They used to let him run.  Well, the first season, I think they let him go because they didn't know how it was going  to turn out.  But after that, they got involved with the cops.  So Chris Hansen goes, okay, well, you're free to go. 
[01:50:30]  And the guy goes like, oh, gets up, walks out the door thinking, yeah, I could leave.  And he's just tackled by the cops.  They come out of the bushes.  Someone was dressed like a tree once.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, my God, the tree is attacking and arresting me.  One guy got caught twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy got caught.  How did he get laid out the first time?  Did they put these people in prison or did they just think?  No.  For some reason, these guys just serve a couple of months.  They really don't get much for showing up at these houses.  But it destroys.  It's almost worth it. 
[01:51:00]  It's almost worth the risk.  You don't get prison time, but it destroys Thanksgiving forever.  I mean, you really can't hang with your family anymore.  It's like, oh, look who's here.  Oh, my internet privileges have been taken away again.  Jeffrey Ross is right.  One guy got caught twice.  So getting back to our guy.  Look who's here.  Make sure he doesn't f*** the turkey.  Where are the kids?  We've set their table up on the roof.  The kids' table. 
[01:51:30]  Barbed wire around it.  Hey, but I got a residual check, Mom.  Get extra stuffing.  Yeah.  Here we go.  I'm going to drink while you finish that up, okay?  So she leaves.  It seems something about that line gets this man thinking.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  Ready for this?  Here we go.  Chris Hansen walks in.  The guy that busts you.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see him, okay? 
[01:52:00]  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands right where I can see him.  Uh-huh.  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  What was your plan tonight?  I want him to come down, you know?  Come down.  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen this show?  You haven't seen it?  I thought you were real funny on Opium Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opium Anthony.  Wow. 
[01:52:30]  That's a plug you don't really want.  That's unbelievable.  What is going through your mind?  I'm just being caught as a pedophile.  Hey, I loved you on Opium Anthony.  I loved you on Opium Anthony.  I think we finally have made it there, Jeffrey Ross, right?  Is this the sign of making it?  That is the most mainstream plug I've ever heard.  That means any slip in the news when people prank the news.  I mean, that is a part of America, the fabric of America.  Great, isn't it?  He's kissing Chris Hansen's butt by plugging your show. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, you were great.  Can I go, please?  Here, hear that again.  I thought you were real funny on Opium Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opium Anthony.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this to happen.  So he could plug the show?  Thanks.  Yeah, you didn't want it to happen, believe me.  I did this for their assault on the media contest.  Yeah, did I win?  Right, man.  Hi, guys.  O and A.  O and A.  I'm not a kid toucher. 
[01:53:30]  I was just trying to win the grand prize.  XM seat warmer.  Yeah.  And then...  I can't believe that.  You haven't set that up.  It's properly...  He's falling through tears to say how much he likes you two.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's caught.  I don't know what ever happened to this guy.  This was last year.  What's so funny about the brownies?  Right when I saw the brownies, I knew.  Because we goof on it all the time.  Yeah.  Like, on this show, we goof on the brownies constantly.  How he's got the brownies and the lemonade out there.  Why don't you have a brownie? 
[01:54:00]  One of the better moments of this show, Jeffrey Ross in the last year, Chris Hansen comes in.  And we had brownies and lemonade stuff for the guy.  Like Santa.  Oh, yeah.  We had Chris Hansen on.  And then he comes in and Anthony does Chris Hansen and Chris Hansen and wouldn't break character.  Yeah, I was like, why don't you take a seat over here?  And then we took clips of him reading the transcripts of these pedophiles and played it.  Like he was saying.  So it's like, Chris Hansen, did you say this?  And it's like, I want to have sex with you. 
[01:54:30]  I know you're a little young, but I'm into that.  And it's Chris Hansen saying it, but he's reading the transcripts of it like, now, Chris, that was you.  And he's just laughing very.  He was very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  But went along with it.  He must have a thing.  He must have some weird inner.  I mean, do that for a living to bust people out like that.  It's like no different than Ashton Kutcher or Punk.  And he's got a weird.  He asked for our.  Yeah, I think there's something going on with him.  Absolutely.  He asked for our emails.  I'm like, I have nothing to hide.  I'm like, F, no, no way am I giving you an email. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  He's like secret CIA.  Because I think he really wanted our emails to just kind of do a little searching to see if he could find anything.  Yeah.  I looked into a name wannabe Nazi 101.  It's like Spitzer.  You know, he goes after hooker rings.  Yeah.  He's got some weird thing inside him.  So maybe Chris Hansen's got.  You always think that if somebody's really into something, like stopping something, that they are kind of into it.  And they want access to the materials, too. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have justifiable access to the materials.  Can I see some of those police files?  Remember Pete Townsend said he was doing research?  I might have to take this home with me.  I always found the Pete Townsend thing when he was there.  The research.  Yeah, yeah.  He was doing research.  And where's this book that he was going to put out?  Or this film or something.  We have doctors and scientists writing books.  What do we care about a guitar guy?  Pete Townsend.  It worked, though.  The guy never did any time or anything.  That thing went away with that excuse.  He's picking up young boys like guitars and windmilling them.  It didn't go right.  Their arms and legs being untouched. 
[01:56:00]  He really did just get away with it, didn't he?  Well, he did write a rock opera about that.  I mean, that had some sort of grounding for the excuse.  True.  Well, then he had to come up with something.  I'm like, oh, crap.  I've got to do something with this.  I'm doing research for a book that'll never see the light of day.  Now I've got to make a crappy CD.  Beyond Blue Balls.  Here's the rest of the brownies.  Here's the rest of the brownie clip.  Who are you?  I knew I was going to be running into you.  I think that's the first time we've had brownies. 
[01:56:30]  I'm kind of chockering about it just because I shouldn't have.  So you think it's funny?  No, I don't think it's funny.  I mean, it's funny how dumb I'm really turning into.  That's great.  Nice use of language.  And it goes on and on.  So there you go.  Oh, yeah.  You think it's funny?  Amazing, right?  Do they ever have weapons on them or anything?  Is there ever going to be...  One guy had weapons in the trunk of his car once, but they bring all kinds of stuff.  Usually they bring like Zima, some kind of... 
[01:57:00]  Gaffer type?  Yeah, some kind of wine coolers for the youngster.  Oh, yeah.  They bring condoms, pot, sometimes Coke.  We can laugh what we want, but think back to when you were young.  Sometimes that was the only way you could get drunk.  It's true.  And I did it without the internet.  I did it through handwritten correspondence.  I was posting all day.  When me and my brother were kids and we used to have the babysitter come over, she would  have her friends all come over. 
[01:57:30]  And they were guys, girls, and they'd be effing and drinking my father's booze.  And they wouldn't care.  We'd be drinking, like seven years old, drunk, looking at the naked chicks getting banged  on the couch.  Wow.  Rocked.  That has to rock.  Yeah.  I once masturbated while babysitting at someone's house and the parents came back.  That was pretty horrific.  Like the kids were asleep.  Oh, okay.  The kids were asleep.  You scared me.  You weren't standing against the crib, were you?  You were hovering.  I've got some on the little mobile.  Oh, God. 
[01:58:00]  I was on the couch downstairs.  I didn't get a lot of alone time in my house.  Gunter was very vigilant.  Gunter.  Gunter.  One time I, the first time I was 16, I don't know, what word were you used?  What word do you use?  Just taking care of yourself.  Not me.  Not me.  Her.  I was doing it to her.  Was that word bad?  Wait, wait.  My first time ever.  All right.  I see.  You're doing something with a, whatever.  Yeah.  You were taking care of her, but let's say you wouldn't be able to juggle at the same  time.  Yeah.  You know, like my first time sort of touching a woman's privates there, you know? 
[01:58:30]  No, now you just ruined it.  That probably won't go.  You just ruined it.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, it's gotten, it's gotten bad, Jeffrey.  So bad.  I'm spending too much time in nightclubs.  We were there.  You just got to have confidence that the listeners could figure it out.  Yeah, they'll figure it out.  I'll be more careful.  Well, now I don't know if we, now save it for after the break, because then I think  they might panic and just don't panic.  We can reset.  Hang on.  We can reset after the break.  I don't know what he was talking about.  No.  I was picking a girl's nose for crying out loud.  There you go.  Like, you know when you go bowling?  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  I like this approach. 
[01:59:00]  The first time you pick the girl's nose, what happens?  Her parents come home, so we break it all out, you know.  In the middle of the picking of the nose.  In the middle of the picking of the nose.  Yeah.  You know, my first time ever, so it's like.  Picking her nose.  It's mind-blowing exciting.  It's very, very cool.  Sure.  Her parents come home.  We're both sitting on the couch, just polite, polite, polite, and the dog runs over, who I've  never met, and he's just licking, licking, licking, licking, licking, licking,  licking, licking, licking, licking my finger.  And they're like, oh, Ralphie loves you. 
[01:59:30]  He doesn't like anybody.  Oh, my.  Oh, that's funny.  Ralphie loves you.  Hey.  And then he went over to the father's hand and started licking that.  And he licked his hand all the way up to the elbow.  Now I'm dating the father.  It's crazy.  When you were picking this girl's nose, did you blow your nose?  No.  It was just very innocent.  All right.  It was just a 15, 16-year-old.  All right.  I got you.  It was very innocent.  Jeffrey Ross at Governor's on Long Island tonight. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, baby.  And where do we go to find out other tour dates?  Jeffery.com, Jeffrey Ross live.  I'm hitting all your cities.  Yeah, because we're live in Cleveland, and they have to see Jeffrey Ross.  Cleveland and Seattle next week.  All right.  And Jim Jeffrey's playing Carolines Thursday through Sunday.  You know.  And they're on tour.  But yeah, that's club in town.  Awesome.  Yeah.  I was just there on Saturday night.  Thank you.  And yeah, Greg took care of me.  Big time.  It's a lot of fun there.  A lot of fun.  It's always great to see you guys in the crowd there.  We're going to wrap up after the break.  We got kids plotting against their teacher. 
[02:00:30]  They want to stab her.  And they're in third grade.  We got a guy talking about UFOs.  And we got a guy.  It looks like he's acting out a video game because he's a crazy guy attacking someone  with a machete.  Then he starts throwing firebombs off the roof.  Sounds like this guy wanted to live.  When the hell did this happen?  We're going to find out after the break.  Okay.  Sounds like he was living Grand Theft Auto or something.  We'll get into those stories in a few.  Opie and Anthony.  If you haven't done this in a while, we're going to do a speed ramp. 
[02:01:00]  There's still lots to do.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Jeffries.  Jeffrey Ross.  And Jeffrey Ross is doing what?  The Reality Awards or something tonight on MTV?  I host with Miss USA the real world 19 seasons worth of reunion.  19 seasons worth of morons all got together in one house up in the hills.  I never quit a show in the middle.  At one point, Trishel threw a drink at me. 
[02:01:30]  And when security wouldn't throw her out, I left.  I got thrown in the pool.  You'll all see it tonight.  Wow.  Why I'm plugging this, I'm not sure.  I still don't understand.  Okay.  I get this call from random call from MTV.  Yeah.  They're going to bring.  They've done 19 seasons of the real world.  It's like 100 people.  I saw maybe three of the seasons.  Right.  So you remember the one with Puck.  Yeah.  That was probably the most popular season.  There's like a Spanish guy who had AIDS or something.  Yeah.  I have AIDS.  I have a boyfriend. 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  My name is Pedro.  I have AIDS.  I have a boyfriend.  You know, he's cute.  He's nice.  Did Pedro show up for the reunion?  I don't think so.  It's a tribute.  I don't think so.  Puck, you put your finger in the peanut butter and then you put it in your mouth.  Yeah.  Well, at least you didn't.  That was great.  Puck smoked his action.  But you don't want to talk.  Stupid Puck smoked his action.  Is he still trying to like capitalize on being a bike messenger at 50 years old or whatever 
[02:02:30]  he is?  I asked him how he has a wife and kids.  I was like, how is Chuck and Buck?  You know, just silly jokes.  Kind of.  And I go, I go, look at you.  I just basically address them all.  I have a tuxedo on.  I got a microphone.  You know, I'm like out there.  It's a beautiful sunset on a Hollywood mansion.  Everybody's dressed up.  It's all blinged out.  And I'm like, you know, a lot of people, some of you are fatter now.  Some of you have kids.  But you all have one thing in common.  Complete and total obscurity.  It's like the biggest episode of intervention ever. 
[02:03:00]  So suddenly, like, Puck, like, wanders in front of my teleprompter.  I can't see the jokes that I prepared.  So I just start making fun of him.  You know, just whatever.  Just nonsense.  Making fun of his outfit.  He's goofy.  And he, like, stops for a second.  He starts screaming just over me and whispers to some buddies, next thing I know, four goons  hurl me into the pool, microphone and all.  Puck has goons?  Yeah.  Really?  In the real world, they have, like, a gang mentality.  You know, they stick together.  And the whole point is to try to get, you know, drama, to get FaceTime. 
[02:03:30]  Uh-huh.  These guys are all full of themselves.  They're all drinking Red Bull.  They're all dumb.  They have nothing to lose.  So they throw the host in the pool.  So then I dry off.  I come back.  I'm a good sport.  It's all on TV tonight.  You can see it.  But, you know, this girl Trish Shell, she used to date Andy Dick.  Oh, that guy's crazy.  I thought Andy Dick was gay.  Isn't he gay?  I thought he was gay.  I think he is, too, but I don't know.  So she... 
[02:04:00]  What the hell is he doing?  She won some award.  She was wasted.  She threw it in the pool, cracked it open, a glass award.  So now they have to drain this pool of the mansion.  She's a horrible person.  So, you know, she wins, like, best, like, female player.  Like, essentially best slut award kind of a thing.  And she goes, I go, you know, don't worry.  I make a joke on the stage.  I go, don't worry.  Like, I spoke to Flava Flav.  You can be on the show.  You know, just an innocent slam.  And she starts screaming at me, you're not funny.  I'm funny. 
[02:04:30]  You're not funny.  I'm funny.  I could deal with her saying I'm not funny.  But when she's saying I'm funny.  Yeah.  And I'm there with my buddy Jordan Rubin.  We're just sitting there.  And I go, I just go like this.  I dismiss her.  I go, shoo.  And that was it.  Shoo.  She threw her drink on me, Jordan.  What a pain in the ass gig you had, Jeffrey.  It was the worst.  I got good money for it.  I can't complain.  It's on tonight?  Yeah.  That's why I'm working governors.  Is it worth watching?  I think the pool stuff will probably be funny.  They'll edit in such a way where it's not going to be funny. 
[02:05:00]  You know that.  Hopefully it'll look like it was more fun than it actually was.  Yeah.  All right.  MTV, to their credit, they made it look like a party.  It was fun.  And you know, anytime you get to make fun of, you know, reality stars, it's my wheelhouse.  Has anyone from the real world gone on to anything?  There's a couple actors out there who do well.  Did Dave Edwards show up?  No.  They wouldn't let him?  He didn't come for some reason.  Is he the black comic from L.A.?  Yeah, the guy who got thrown out from season one, I think.  Two.  Oh, was it season two?  It went to New York, then L.A., right? 
[02:05:30]  And then finally, and then San Francisco was third.  I think they did London, yeah.  And then I watched the Boston one because we were living up there at the time.  And then I really haven't seen it since.  Yeah, it's worth it.  I heard the Vegas one was the best one, but I don't know.  I don't know.  I think the popular one is the most popular.  I'm just trying to relate to your dumb gig, Jeffrey.  I know.  I'm trying.  You know, jokes will travel, and you know, Opie, that's how it goes.  All right.  Hey, speed round here.  We got a great story.  A bunch of third graders up to no good here.  In Georgia, two third graders are arrested, and a third one is expected to be for allegedly plotting  an attack on their teacher. 
[02:06:00]  Police say they are part of a group of about nine boys and girls who brought a steak knife,  handcuffs, and duct tape to school.  Authorities say they were apparently planning to knock their teacher unconscious, tie her  up, and then stab her to get back at her for disciplining one of the kids.  When the hell did this happen?  We've got to question how bad this teacher is.  If nine of them get together and go, let's stab her and duct tape her?  Yeah, right.  Let's stop picking on the kids and let's have a strong look at this woman. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, you know, you make a really good point.  You know, there's always one crazy wacko, but nine, you might be onto something.  Yeah.  You remember at school, there was some sadistic, they had the cane, you know, do you call it  the cane where you used to get hit?  Oh, the cane.  In Australia, we call it the cane, like where you could be hit with like a cane.  No, they'd arrest you.  And we had this teacher, they actually put it on the news.  They said, as of Monday, the cane will be outlawed in Sydney, right?  They said this on the Thursdays.  Oh, wow. 
[02:07:00]  There was one teacher that was like, it's cane and days.  And he's just walking around the school going, Jeffries, your shirt's undone.  Come with me.  It was a big mark of respect if you could get the cane on the last day.  So everyone was like really working for it at about two o'clock.  Caning day.  Caning day.  Unbelievable.  Hey, J.D. Collins from Maine, going backwards.  Thank you, J.D.  The Miz, who's done our show many, many times from the real world.  The second time they did New York, I think. 
[02:07:30]  He's from Cleveland originally.  He's now in the WWE, The Miz.  Yeah, The Miz.  He was there.  But he was on the real world.  He was a good sport.  He's a really good guy, man.  But he also went out with that Dingbatcher show.  Did he really?  Yeah.  And Eric had some kind of MTV career for a while, didn't he?  He had the dance show.  Eric Knies.  Yeah.  Eric Knies.  He looks like a homeless veteran now.  Oh, God.  He looks really bad.  Really?  She did a pilot that I did, actually.  I did one in Cancun for Spring Break.  I did two. 
[02:08:00]  I was hosting a game show, and Pauly Shore was on it.  I think she was one of the contestants, too.  It was atrocious.  That's what I love about MTV.  They will throw different people all together, and you never know what's going to happen.  Yeah.  But you know what we're going to do.  Yeah.  You and Miss America.  Yeah.  That's a weird mix.  I bet you just met you today, but I don't know what she looks like, but you would have been  mismatched.  Yeah.  No.  It was like Beauty and the Beast, believe me.  Yeah.  You guys want a crazy guy to attack someone with a machete, then start throwing firebombs 
[02:08:30]  off the roof, or another school story?  Teacher finds it is fine for letting students beat late classmate.  Which one do you want?  Beat a late classmate?  Yeah.  That's a cute story.  You want that one?  Sure.  We'll keep with the school theme for a minute here.  While you're queuing that up, one time my nephew, he's seven, he's eight, his fellow  classmates put strawberry lip gloss on a teacher's coffee cup because they knew she was allergic  to strawberry, and she had to go to the hospital.  Yeah.  See, that's a good joke.  That's a bit of fun.  That's something to do with duct tape and shivving your teacher. 
[02:09:00]  You call it shivving over here?  No, that's all right.  Yeah, I was stumbling.  I heard that story, though, on the way in, the kids, they wanted to duct tape her and  kidnap her or something, and they had kids that were in charge of blocking the windows  and the door, kids that were in charge of holding the knives, the duct tape, and it was  because she reprimanded some kid for standing on his chair, and they all got together, like  this big conspiracy.  Who's the, like, which one's the top dog kid there that was able to rally the troops 
[02:09:30]  like that?  Maybe it was a Dead Poets Society moment.  Yeah.  He was inspiring the other kids.  Right.  But what, so you've got kids looking in the windows, kids duct taping, another kid that's  going to kidnap.  You've got to have a big kid who's controlling all the other kids who aren't going along with  it.  Yeah.  Well, we ask logistics.  We're leaving out a big part of the story.  It's coming in a lot.  Justin B. from PA, he writes, the story, you guys are leaving out the fact that the third  graders were in the special ed class. 
[02:10:00]  What?  How good at plotting could they possibly be?  See, no, but that's maybe why they were so angry.  Maybe he couldn't stand on the chair and she made him.  Yeah, with that big head of hair.  It's a statistic type of...  It got him off balance.  He's being responsible.  They're not very good plotters, though.  They would just say it out loud.  Okay, tomorrow we can't...  All right.  We've got kidnap, yo.  Where was this?  I don't know.  They've got the quadriplegic to block the door.  Oh, Atlanta.  Oh, Atlanta.  They were probably all 16.  That gives the story some heart, right? 
[02:10:30]  Exactly.  Now you're more curious about what kind of a witch the teacher is.  It gives it some heart.  Yeah.  That these people had to overcome their handicaps to do this.  And then they've worked as a team.  I think this is beautiful.  I think this is an inspiring student.  She might have to get Teacher of the Year Award.  She was able to teach these kids something.  Something tells me this special education wasn't because they were retarded.  No, it was because they were fire starters.  Yeah, yeah.  This is like the special ed class where it's like, keep them away from the good kids.  We're just going to pile them all into this classroom. 
[02:11:00]  There wasn't one of them that wasn't a cutter.  Yeah.  They had a hang on the other side of school.  Remember that?  Remember that other side of your school?  And one of the message boards printed a makeup of the school broken down by ethnicity.  And it was a very high concentration of African American students.  You never miss an opportunity, do you?  I was just saying that because a lot of people were probably wondering that because I know 
[02:11:30]  I was when I first heard the story, I was curious.  Are you saying they're more likely to be special needs?  I don't understand.  No, I'm just stating facts of the story.  I'm not speculating as to why or how, who, that.  Just laying it out there.  And also, they were higher than the normal school.  A lot of tall kids.  Tall kids, yes.  I'm just saying they were tall.  There were a lot of people who were burning things, but their basketball team, awesome.  Here's another school story. 
[02:12:00]  A man who used to teach at this high school in Delta, Colorado, is facing abuse charges  because of how he decided to handle a tardy student.  For his disciplinary actions in this were to have the student do so many setups or push-ups  in an allotted amount of time.  Apparently, the late student either couldn't or wouldn't do the sit-ups and push-ups.  So 22-year-old teacher Brian Havel told the other students to hit their classmates.  The student reported this or told his parents about it who, again, they're the ones who initiated it. 
[02:12:30]  That's how we found out about it.  The parents approached the high school and got us involved.  The school district says parents won't have to worry about the teacher anymore.  Mr. Havel is no longer at Delta High School, and we have received a letter of resignation.  Havel is now facing child abuse charges.  Don't have to worry about him anymore.  They got all the other teachers to punch him.  I don't think that's what the army does. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Remember Private Pyle getting the old bars of soap and the socks?  Oh, yeah.  Ow!  Ow!  Sad sack.  Is there still a sad sack comic book?  I like him.  Sad sack?  Yeah, there is.  It's pretty amazing that punishment, physical punishment, is no longer allowed.  You can't even hug a kid now.  It's like my whole life was threats and afraid of the belt and the hitting, and now kids can  say and do whatever they want without fear.  You had those teachers that were the teachers that hugged you when you were having a tough 
[02:13:30]  time in school.  You're not allowed to do that anymore.  But then there was an outrage over that.  Then they decide, well, you could hug a kid, but it can't be for more than two seconds,  because then they try to bring the hug back.  It's just a mess.  The school system is a mess.  You have to put your own Band-Aids on and stuff as a kid.  They're not allowed to help you with your wound or anything like that.  No touching.  Yeah, so all my tears were...  Yeah.  You have to teach yourself math and English now, too.  They can't talk.  The teachers can't talk. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  This was fun.  Jeffrey Ross, the Reality World Awards on MTV tonight.  I got confused.  I thought you meant the Reality Awards.  Like all reality shows, right?  No, no.  Oh, the Real World Awards.  Okay.  Yeah, it's like a made-up reality show.  It's fun.  But come to Governors.  That'll be much cooler.  Governors tonight on Long Island.  Yeah.  Jim Jeffries, Caroline's later on this week, Thursday through Friday.  Thank you.  Thursday through Sunday, excuse me.  I got dates in Detroit and Chicago coming up, as well as New York. 
[02:14:30]  Just check my MySpace.  Jim Norton on MySpace.  All right.  We're out of here.  We got to get to XM.  Have a good day.  Guess how many boobs dates are today?  Whip them out Wednesday.  They've got these stickers all over New York, and it's called Whip Them Out Wednesdays.  You drive around, the lovely ladies see it, they pull up next to you, and maybe give them 
[02:15:00]  a little lift.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  Ah, where are we? 
[02:15:30]  I know where we are.  I'm just saying, like, as far as all the buttons that need to be pushed here.  We got Jeffrey Ross that just changed his audition so he can hang at XM, which is very 
[02:16:00]  cool when our guests do that.  And then we got Jim Jeffries over there, so we're all set and ready to go.  I love staying around for this part of the show.  I love the studio.  Hey, change your audition.  Yeah.  It was a meeting.  More of a meeting.  I was just telling Jimbo about it.  Yeah, we're on air.  Is my microphone?  I can't hear your headphones.  Oh, you've got to turn up your headphones.  Yeah.  Oh, that's much better.  There we go.  I was inspired by Jim Norton.  I'm out pitching a book this week.  Oh, really?  A lot of interest.  What's the book going to be about?  How to Roast Your Friends.  Really?  The Way of the Roast Master. 
[02:16:30]  How to Bust Balls Without Burning Bridges.  We talked about this last time.  That's good.  Roast means something completely different in Britain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is it again in Britain?  If you're spit roasted, it's two guys fucking a chick.  It's like, where do you put a pig on a spit?  On the rotisserie.  Oh, okay.  On the rotisserie.  We call it on the rotisserie, yeah.  So if you go, we roasted some chick, that means...  It's kind of similar.  Yeah, you're fucking somebody.  Yeah.  And friends are involved.  Yeah.  Do you know statistically, nine out of ten people enjoy gang rape? 
[02:17:00]  Nine out of ten?  Wow.  We've got a couple of great things for this side of the show.  Sam is being a wise-ass.  Oh, really?  That should never happen.  I know we're getting away from April Fool's Day and pranks and stuff, but Sam handed this  to me and said, you might want to play this and then make fun of Steve.  Oh, here comes Sam.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Ask Jim about flying to Australia, where he can't go. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yes.  I can't.  I'm not allowed in Dubai anymore.  Why?  Well, I made a joke.  You know, remember when the teddy bear was called Muhammad?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I got on stage on television the next time and I said, oh, it's about this teddy bear.  I go, so if there's any Muslim fundamentals in the room, you see this microphone, I'm calling  it Muhammad and it's gay.  And all I want to do is roll the Quran up and fuck itself up the ass, right?  And I said this and then I was just doing it as a joke because the teddy bear wasn't 
[02:18:00]  a big deal, right?  Yeah.  So they banned me from going to Arab countries, but the only free one you can travel through  is going into Dubai, right?  But I'm still allowed to go to Iraq and Afghanistan to gigs for troops because I'm under the British  military protection.  But I'm not allowed to travel into where the five-star resort are.  You said that joke in Dubai?  No, I said it on television in Britain.  Oh, in Britain.  Okay.  No.  I thought you were brave enough to actually say that at a gig in Dubai.  Hey, how you doing?  I'll be leaving out the back door.  My car will explode shortly after it leaves the building. 
[02:18:30]  That teddy bear thing was ridiculous.  The teddy bear was silly.  It was silly, man.  Yeah.  All right.  We got Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Yeah, no.  Speaking of teddy bears, he's our own little Sammy bear.  By the way, Sam is still growing his afro.  I know.  He won't stop doing it.  Why are you still growing it?  I thought we won Afro Wars.  I did too, but Dave keeps saying he didn't lose.  All right.  But I think he's waiting for the year anniversary of the Imus controversy.  So he can actually have the hairstyle Imus was commenting on.  Because it really is getting a little... 
[02:19:00]  It's very nappy.  Yeah.  Richard Simmons.  Yeah.  It is Richard Simmons.  Buckwheat.  Yeah.  Because I'm not going to shave my head thinking the contest is over and then have Dave, since  he's got that awful haircut still.  You're starting to enjoy the afro, I'm thinking.  Well, I'm not going to lose this contest.  This is a different Sam.  I think he's enjoying the afro.  Yeah.  You look like the sound guy from the Little Rascals.  Yep.  We have an afro contest with Eastside Dave from The Ron and Fez Show.  And we finally said enough.  We came back from vacation.  We pinned him down.  And we shaved him a reverse mohawk. 
[02:19:30]  We're like, end of contest, Sam wins.  Of course.  Not fair.  But we like wrestling angles on our show and their show.  So we're like, it's fair as far as that goes.  Yeah.  Dave decided that he's not going to lose this contest.  So he took what we did and made an old man horseshoe where it's really bushy on the sides.  It's horrific.  Get a picture of what Eastside Dave looks like now.  And he said, contest is still on.  I'm not shaving.  So he looks completely ridiculous.  And now young Sam here feels like I can't back out of this contest. 
[02:20:00]  Right?  Yeah, I can't.  And he also said he definitely won't admit defeat until you give him the $500 that he thinks  he is owed for winning the biggest game.  I gave him $100 so far.  $100 is good.  I gave him $100 so far.  That's it.  I'll give him maybe another $100 and then we're going to call it even.  Yeah.  So, I mean, anyway, you got this thing.  You hand it to me.  Yeah, well, because some radio show did an April Fool's prank where they played a prank  on one of the guys on the show apparently and said, your grandma's on the phone. 
[02:20:30]  And then the grandma pretended to have a heart attack.  And the guy pretended that he didn't know that his grandma was pretending to have a heart attack.  And then they all laughed about it.  It was really stupid, I thought.  And it's April 2nd.  It's not April 1st anymore.  That's the genius.  Of course.  Steve kept insisting that you guys wanted more April Fool's Day stuff.  So, April Fool's.  It's April Fool's week.  April Fool's.  So, you're basically saying this sucks.  Like, I wouldn't, I'm not going to, I won't get behind it.  It might, you might find some enjoyment out of your haircut status. 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  He doesn't look very happy.  Actually, to clarify the line of bullshit that Sam just gave you.  What will, what I actually said was, guys.  Uh, I'll suck anyone's dick.  I'll suck anybody's dick in this room.  Isolate that, I'm sure you will anyway.  April Mules.  I asked if you guys were still interested in, in, in the April Fool's audio.  Because I just got this stupid link to some clip. 
[02:21:30]  And since I can only get about 30 seconds into any piece of fucking audio before I get interrupted for something.  I asked Sam to listen to it.  So, the insistence on, on cutting it up, the insistence on handing it to you, is utter fabrication.  By one of your guys.  Yes.  All right.  Are you going to fire Sam for lying?  Yes.  Yes.  That's when Anthony does impressions that aren't even.  Oh, I just, yeah.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, none of that over the air.  I'm just, I was doing a visual impression.  I want to know why Steve just said, pack your shit.  It's not like he's trying to be an intern. 
[02:22:00]  Ouch.  Uh, well, well, let's, uh, take a listen to this.  This is a show out of Denver.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, the show's called BJ Howie and, of course, Jennifer.  Oh, ugh.  Oh, Jennifer's probably good, though.  One of these radio shows is going to understand you, you don't need the hole.  You just don't need the hole on the radio with you.  All right.  First of all, we're going to make a phone call here.  We got to congratulate Howie's grandmother, Nance.  She's 81 years old.  We just want to, we just want to congratulate her. 
[02:22:30]  Nance?  Nance, how are you?  Uh, I'm not very good, huh?  I can't breathe good today.  You can't breathe?  What's the matter?  I can't get my breath.  I didn't sleep good last night, huh?  I had bad chest pain.  Oh, my.  You're having chest pains?  Yeah.  Like acid indigestion type?  Oh, I can't breathe.  I can't catch my breath.  Well, Nance, hang on a second.  Is it because of all the excitement?  Are you feeling well? 
[02:23:00]  No.  No, I don't feel good.  I didn't sleep all night last night.  I can't breathe.  My vagina has mice.  Does anyone else get it?  She doesn't feel good.  Right.  I get the joke.  But she's...  Oh, my.  She's a good actress.  They stink.  They are horrid.  She's good.  She's pulling off.  I didn't feel too good.  She's almost believable.  I don't feel bad.  It's just pains.  So, why don't you feel bad?  Is it a stomach problem?  Oh, jeepers, creepers. 
[02:23:30]  You're kidding.  You don't feel well.  So, you don't feel good.  Hacks.  So, let me get this straight.  You're not sleeping?  That's not even a sign of a heart attack, not sleeping.  Yeah.  I'm not sleeping.  I think sleeping is a sign of a heart attack.  Yeah, sleeping for a long time.  And here's one of the actors isolated.  Oh, no.  We all know.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I thought you were going to go the other one.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, I don't have that here.  I thought you were going to go the other one.  When the hell did this happen?  Right. 
[02:24:00]  And then it continues.  Now that they made it perfectly clear that Grandma doesn't feel good.  She doesn't feel well.  Get it?  Wah, wah, wah.  Do you need something?  Is Jimmy there?  Jimmy's asleep, honey.  Well, can you wake him up?  Tell him that you need some help.  Are you okay?  Beans.  Lori.  Lori.  Beans.  All right.  Now you've got to get the Broncos tail out.  Oh, these guys are horrid.  Look, now he has to build up the excitement. 
[02:24:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, my.  Oh, yeah.  Doing the radio voice the whole time.  Do you need something?  Is Jimmy there?  Jimmy's asleep, honey.  Well, can you wake him up?  Tell him that you need some help.  Are you okay?  No, I can't, honey.  I can't.  I can't breathe.  Oh, honey.  Oh, honey.  Help me, honey.  Help.  What?  Help me, honey. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, no.  We need to.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that awful?  Oh, my God.  Oh, and the hole is.  Her dying has put a dampener on the show.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  They can't stop the show at any point to maybe call 911.  Right, right.  They can't stop the show to just see if she's okay.  Go to commercials.  We'll finish this bit right after traffic and weather together. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, because our PD says we've got to get that in, even though we're trying to pull  this off.  We'll send our traptor copter over to check you out.  The irony is, if this was real, it would be funny.  Right.  If the grandmother really was dying on the air, that's going to be great.  And they were acting like this?  Hysterical.  But she's not, and they're acting like this.  It sucks.  Of course, the fucking broad just has to suck even.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's bad when people die.  Well, let's see.  Oh.  How'd your parents die?  Let's see if the acting gets better here. 
[02:26:00]  I doubt it.  I backed it up a bit here.  Oh.  Help me, God.  Oh, no.  We need to, we need to, we need to, oh my God.  Oh, you need to pick up the phone.  Oh, my God.  Pick up the phone.  Nance.  Pick it up.  If you can pick it up.  Nance, can you hear me?  Did she fall?  I don't know.  Nance, something's wrong.  I got to call somebody.  You think?  You think something's wrong?  What was the indicator?  You think you got to call somebody?  Maybe the phone dropping, the fact that she said she had chest pains and didn't feel good. 
[02:26:30]  You got to do some honeymooners here, because the acting is just like that.  Mr. Faber-sham, there's something wrong here.  Something wrong.  No.  Rachel.  It's her art.  What was the indicator there was a problem?  When you said, how are you?  And she said, my left arm is numb, and I can't see anything, and I smell oranges.  Fucking assholes.  Make a trade.  What was their reasoning for calling her to begin with?  What was their reasoning for?  I don't know.  To set up the April Fool's show.  Yeah, to set up the gags. 
[02:27:00]  We're going to ring an old lady for no apparent reason.  Well, the old lady's the grandma, one of the hosts.  Oh, no!  The one that's really distressed.  Smokezilla from Kentucky writes, April douche.  And then they give you the big reveal here, everybody.  Because they can't sit, you know, might as well give away one of our secrets today.  What?  If you can do something like this, you leave everyone fucking hanging.  But they're too scared to leave everyone hanging.  Yeah, oh, gosh.  We got to wrap this up. 
[02:27:30]  Howie, what do you want me to do here?  I can't believe it.  Put her back on.  Nance!  April Fool's time!  What are you talking about, April Fool's?  Are you okay?  I'm fine.  It's just payback time, boy.  That is so much.  I can't even believe that.  Man, she scared us.  Got that right.  I got you, Hawk.  I can't even believe it.  She hung up.  Yeah.  Boom! 
[02:28:00]  Shame, shame, shame, shame.  Now, this is what I don't understand.  There's a show like that in every city in America, right?  And you hear the, ha, ha, I can't believe it.  Are they really buying into the fact that they think it's a good radio bid, or are they  trying to just sell it?  I don't understand.  That is so, that was awful.  He was fooled.  You know how this works, Jimbo.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  That was so bad.  Just radio.  There's always a hype man in the crowd there at those shows to keep things moving like 
[02:28:30]  a last track.  Ha, ha.  Well, you got the hype man, you got the hole, and you got the professional broadcaster.  Hey, Grandma!  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  I'm breaking your balls, and right away you're getting fucking fresh.  I have a heart attack at my fucking party.  He's just getting a little fucking manic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Billy Bats.  Motherfucker.  He's getting fresh.  He's getting fresh.  Right away he's getting fucking fresh.  Wow, the big reveal is just, it's so bad. 
[02:29:00]  Let me hear that again.  What do you want me to do here?  Can't believe it.  Put her back on.  Nance!  It's a fool, Todd!  What are you talking about, April?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What the heck is this?  What the...  This would be the appropriate reaction.  Could you play her for a second?  Sure.  Howie, what do you want me to do?  I can't believe it.  Put her back on.  Nance!  It's a fool, Todd!  Ah, you got me, you cunt. 
[02:29:30]  Yuck.  It's a fool, Todd!  What are you talking about?  It's a fool, Todd!  Are you okay?  Oh, the whole...  I'm fine.  It's just payback time, boy.  Wouldn't it be great if she slipped right then and there and broke her hip?  Yeah.  Payback time.  Fucking right down those steps and paralyze yourself.  I got you, Todd.  Fucking Doritos hip just breaks.  Fucking old bag. 
[02:30:00]  They don't believe it and a dog starts eating her face.  Yeah, they're just laughing at her.  And she's sitting there with shattered graham crackers in her fucking pelvis.  And fucking liquidy shit all the way down the steps.  You old hag.  Thank you.  What's the matter?  I don't know.  There's a man tying me up with a cord to my wheelchair.  Throwing me down the stairs.  Fido down.  That's my ear.  Fido down the stairs.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  Fuck them.  Oh, the old lady was fine until she gave the reveal that I fucking hate her guts to.  Yeah.  I propose.  It's payback time, boys.  It's payback time, boys.  Oh, Owen.  It's payback time.  Owen.  But people understand that everybody was in on the gag.  Everybody.  Of course.  It wasn't like the grandma was pulling a gag on just one of the guys and two out of the...  They all knew.  Yeah.  Oh, they had to rehearse it.  That really fucking makes me angry.  I think the ultimate April Fool's joke would be to make April Fool's Day on a different day. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, just like kill a person on April 5th.  Yeah.  That's a good joke.  April Fool.  Yeah.  You didn't see that coming, did you, you cunt?  I'm Chris Hansen.  People are picking out their favorite part.  I'll get that show that you said where they get the pedophiles and just let him get away with it.  That's a good April Fool's Day joke.  Yeah.  Don't bust him.  Chester's Liver writes, the R U OK is quite possibly the biggest douche chill giving sentence ever. 
[02:31:30]  Are you OK?  Can we please hear the reveal again?  The reveal?  You like the reveal, huh?  I bet when he first heard this.  I already threw that out.  Steve was wiping.  Can you get it out of the garbage?  Steve was wiping his tears away.  Thank God she's OK.  Nothing.  Wow.  That was an April Fool's bomb.  All right.  Here we go again.  The big reveal.  Howie, what do you want me to do here?  Can't believe it.  Put her back on.  Nance.  April Fool's hot. 
[02:32:00]  What are you talking about, April Fool's?  Oh.  Are you OK?  I'm fine.  It's just payback time, boy.  That is so much.  I can't even believe that.  Nance, you scared us.  I got you, Hap.  Well, people are going with the, uh, it's payback time line.  We can have a little fun with this.  I want to thank Steve for bringing the fine bit to the Opie and Anthony show today.  Well, he was doubtful, but it was good.  Yeah.  Tim H. from Columbus writes, it's payback time. 
[02:32:30]  This is what you get for marrying that colored girl.  Oh, God.  We can play it's payback time if you like.  It's payback time.  This is what you get for not aborting that thing with Down syndrome.  I have to pass on my knee.  Why?  You have to pass on your knee.  I think Down syndrome is the one disease, like not disease, disability that hasn't been  used in stand-up.  Which one?  I call the other one Down syndrome.  Everything else.  You've got midgets.  You've got people with cerebral palsy.  You've got no Down syndrome comics. 
[02:33:00]  No.  It's just by nature.  They're walking around.  They don't realize they're comics.  You've never heard of it.  Assaulting someone.  I reckon.  I reckon we can get together.  You never heard of Rich Voss?  God damn it.  I'm glad you're here.  Oh, that's good.  We all missed that.  We missed that one.  The first thing I said in 20 minutes.  I was waiting for that.  I just think it's an untapped market.  Yeah.  There's a lot of jokes about having a dick and being able to lift heavy things that people  can make.  We have another comment about that bit, because now the listeners are calling in here. 
[02:33:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious, goodness gracious.  And I love the people that get the inside shit we talk about.  Matt Lamb from New York City writes, it's amazing that this old bitch probably called  at exactly 7.15 a.m. when the most people are listening.  Yeah.  What show is that?  Can we see pictures of these guys?  That's fucking horrendous.  That's horrendous.  Can we see pictures of the grandma?  Sounds like she's a regular. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Where's she?  Nance.  Yeah.  Let's see how close to death she actually is.  I'm not feeling too well.  Well, you want to play at payback time a little more of that?  Sure.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas, it's payback time.  That's what you get for kicking my dog in the liver.  And then Sam's camera from Albany, it's payback time.  This is for sending me to the home where my bippy gets violated each night.  What's a bippy?  A puss.  It's a cunt.  And Blue Heeler from Kentucky suggesting, 
[02:34:30]  isolate the grandma having a heart attack, and play porn behind it.  You got that good porn clip, Ant?  No, I don't have that one.  Not porn music.  The good coming clips.  Oh, where are those?  Let's try to make this bit funny for these assholes.  We'll punch it up for them.  Ah, there it is.  By the way, Down Syndrome, someone's saying it's obvious you don't listen to the show a lot  because one of our best bits ever was those Down Syndrome kids doing knock-knock jokes. 
[02:35:00]  Remember that?  We went on for like 45 minutes.  Knock-knock, who's there?  Oh, yeah.  Remember that bit?  Holy shit, was that brutal.  I like to hear that.  It's like 45 minutes.  Oh, God, we went off.  We took a lousy 10-second clip and probably did 45 minutes.  Was it knock-knock?  The one guy told the retarded joke or such shit?  And then it's, who's there?  And then we would stop the tape over and over.  And we would tell the little fella who's there.  Oh, it was never anything good, was it?  No, no.  I've written a sexual thriller with two Down Syndrome people called Eyes Wide Apart. 
[02:35:30]  All Access reports the passing of Darian O'Toole?  That's got to be a fucking joke.  Mm-mm.  Do we have our last interview?  Yeah.  We do?  Well, I don't know if that's actually, no.  All Access reports the passing of Darian O'Toole.  She was, well, if she's dead, you know, she was.  If she's not, she is. 
[02:36:00]  I really don't know.  When she called last time?  It could be a little April 2nd joke that's being played on us.  All right.  Okay.  Is she okay?  Oh, my God.  Let's get her on the phone.  We'll find out.  Anyway, you got the porn clip, the really nasty one?  All right, here we go.  Of course I do.  Grandma having a heart attack.  All right, first of all, we're going to make a phone call here.  We've got to congratulate Howie's grin.  Oh, thank you.  It was Olive who?  Yes.  That's the bit.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  And then it was, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Olive, but I shouldn't.  I should have a hanger in my head.  All right, first of all, we're going to make a phone call here.  We've got to congratulate Howie's grandmother, Nance.  She's 81 years old.  We just want to congratulate her.  She's sick.  Nance.  Nance, how are you?  I'm not very good at heart.  I can't breathe good today.  You can't breathe?  What's the matter?  When do you want the porn?  I can't get my breath. 
[02:37:00]  I didn't sleep good last night, huh?  I had bad chest pain.  Oh, my.  You're having chest pains?  Oh, my.  When he goes, oh, my.  Oh, I can't breathe.  I can't touch my breath.  Well, Nance, hang on a second.  Is it because of all the excitement?  Are you feeling well?  Is it because of all the excitement?  All the excitement of what?  That show?  Fuck.  I can't breathe.  Maybe it's just the next.  Can't breathe.  Is it the fucking male nurse with the pillow over your face? 
[02:37:30]  I can't breathe.  The fucking angel of death is squishing a pillow in my face.  Is it the lawyer with the pen in your hand?  Florida Steed.  Florida Steed writes, olive to an average of 34 years old.  It went odd.  I don't remember any of them.  You don't remember?  No, there was so many. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Try to find a little clip of that.  Olive.  Olive who cut and.  It's brutal, Jim.  Do you need something?  Is Jimmy there?  Give me your sleep, honey.  Well, can you wake him up?  Tell him that you need some help.  Are you okay?  No, I can't, honey.  I can't.  I can't breathe.  Oh, honey.  Oh, honey.  Help me, honey.  Help me, honey. 
[02:38:30]  Help me, honey.  How are we?  We need to.  We need to.  Oh, my God.  We need to pick up the phone.  Oh, my God.  Pick up the phone.  Pants.  Pick it up.  If you can pick it up.  Dan, can you hear me?  Did she fall?  I don't know.  Dan, something's wrong.  I got to call somebody.  Goodness gracious.  You know that's got to hurt.  I can smell your mouth.  I'm so excited.  We've got to call the authorities ASAP. 
[02:39:00]  ASAP, yeah.  Right after these words from.  We'll let you know what happened to Grandma right after these messages.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll try these words from Depends Undergarment.  Yuck.  Oh, that was awful.  Please, can we get their website up?  I have to see that.  I like how they're going, did she fall?  Who speaks on the phone standing up when you're 80 years old?  Dudes, where's Erock?  He's got to be distraught today.  He was banging this broad on the side.  Darren O'Toole passes on.  Everyone at All Access is saddened to report the passing of veteran radio personality Darian 
[02:39:30]  O'Toole yesterday following a long illness.  Really?  O'Toole's long career included stops at blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah.  No word on services so far.  Is this true?  Yesterday, April Fool's?  That can't be true.  It can't be true.  Do you think she's doing her own fucking thing?  She's a fucking idiot.  Yesterday for want.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  If she is dead, the joke's on her.  Yeah.  No one noticed.  How hilarious would it be to die in April Fool's and everyone thinks it's a joke.  Because you're a radio.  Because you're a radio person. 
[02:40:00]  That's horrid.  It's even worse if they believe that you don't care.  Can we check that she's okay?  Has she fallen?  We all just crumbled the fucking article up and threw it.  Like, whatever.  Who cares?  I landed right on my helmet.  I never heard of her until she did this, so it worked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wrapping up our April Fool's coverage, we got Kim in Virginia.  Kim, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just moved, so I had to listen to the radio, the local radio.  Yeah.  We don't have TV yet or cable.  So this local radio station did this big hack fit where they said, first of all, they said 
[02:40:30]  they've been waiting three years to do this.  And they told everybody they were cleaning out the phone lines and they had to cover up  their phones with bags.  Oh, that old gag.  Cover up your phones with a plastic bag because we've got to blow out the phone lines.  They're going to be blowing out the phone lines and you'll get dust all over your  house.  So cover your phone in plastic bags.  It was so hack and so awful.  And what if people drop in their phones and fucking, is there cell phones in little plastic 
[02:41:00]  baggies now?  Because how many people really have phones?  They're like covering their studio phones and talking about how they had to do that and  then they had some lady call in and said, is this for real?  Because I've got to call my aunt and tell her she's got to cover up her phone because  her whole house will get dirty.  We better get audio of this one.  This one sounds terrific.  People should then go around and look for bags on phones and blow the person's head off  with a shotgun if there's a bag on their fucking phone.  Just kill them. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it just made me sick to listen to.  Thank you, Kim.  We appreciate that.  Unbelievable.  That's an all.  I have a better gag.  We're blowing out granny.  Put a bag over her fucking head.  We're going to blow out her ass and see the dust that comes out her mouth.  Puddle of AIDS.  I'll live.  Puddle of AIDS?  Well, he's just one of our regular students.  The famous puddle of AIDS.  He writes, I'll live till I choke to death on my tongue.  I think that was one, wasn't it? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, that does sound familiar.  It rings a bell.  Matt LaFarre from Queensbury.  He hasn't checked in in a while.  He writes, Olive, who?  I'll live long enough to ruin every family photo for the next 40 years.  I remember that one.  And a new one coming in from Kent, the movie guy from San Francisco.  He writes, Olive, Olive, who?  I'll live longer than Darren O'Toole.  Oh, that's sweet.  He worked it in with Clever, a recent death.  She doesn't say that she's dead.  She just passed on. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, where'd she go?  What does that mean?  That doesn't mean anything.  Because I don't want to upset the Christians, but there is no heaven.  And if you've got any dead relatives, you're never seeing them again.  That's just my theory.  That's wonderful, Jim.  Thank you.  Some of us like to feel like there's something, a little hope out there.  No, you want to go on forever, do you?  Let it end at some stage.  Bloody hell.  You want to exist forever and ever?  Bloody hell.  That seems to be the thing everybody wants.  I don't want to be thinking for the rest of my life. 
[02:43:00]  You just want to rest.  I don't like thinking as it is.  Where's me passport?  Can't punch women in the street.  You just want it at some point to just stop.  I would like an ending.  I would like an ending.  Yeah.  I don't want to go to heaven.  Do you really want to?  Hey, not in the traditional sense.  I don't want to walk around on a cloud with wings and all that happy horse shit.  Put my face in a 16-year-old girl's ass.  That's heaven.  Yeah, but even then, after a while, you'd get used to it, wouldn't you? 
[02:43:30]  Like, there would become a stage where you'd go, I could fucking lick balls now I've been  doing this for so long.  That's what happened to Chuck Berry.  Anybody who gets too much puss goes crazy like that.  You're right.  They're going to get shit and pissed on.  You should know.  You betcha.  You betcha.  You betcha.  All right.  Hey, we started this little war with WEEI in Boston.  It's going very well, by the way.  Too busy to take all the phone calls that are coming in, but we appreciate the job you're  doing so far.  And we got the, this is very famous, actually, a voicemail. 
[02:44:00]  John Dennis leaves an angry voicemail for, like, a listener.  This is really good shit.  And we'll play it after the break, because I got to take a leak.  Oh, a tease.  I didn't mean to tease, because we already have you.  You're already paying for this crap, so.  But I do have to take a leak.  Plug our dates, will you?  You do that while I go.  Can I?  Yeah.  Do whatever you want.  Do you want to plug?  You plug mine, I'll plug yours.  I don't know yours.  JJ over here is going to be at Caroline's this week.  He's doing a lot of stuff in Cleveland.  I'm going to be in Cleveland, Seattle, and tonight at Governor's for the first time ever 
[02:44:30]  on Long Island.  What is Governor's?  First time ever?  Yeah, I've never been there.  Hey, Governor!  Yeah, is it just like that?  It's just a whole lot of people who think they're in the place.  Yeah, they just go, hey, Governor!  That's the place in Levittown.  Then Hilarity's in Cleveland.  And the Giggles in Seattle.  The Giggles?  Classy names.  I don't know.  I've never been there.  Sounds like a stripper.  Giggles.  Giggles.  Stripper.  Yuck.  They don't even strip right anymore.  Just stand there.  A little bit of weaving of the hips. 
[02:45:00]  And then they come down to extort money from you.  I like the old days where you had some dollar bills.  You're drinking a beer.  She'd walk on the bar.  You'd toss her some bucks.  And she'd stand there in front of you for a little while.  Go to the next guy.  Not trying to extort 20 bucks out of you for a lap dance every fucking lap around the bar.  It's crazy.  Enough already.  When the hell did this happen?  You gotta hit Tampa.  When the hell did this happen?  Tampa.  That's where a strip club is.  I like old school stripping. 
[02:45:30]  Girls with balloons and a cigarette.  Oh, wow.  That is old school.  They still have that in Australia.  Do they?  No, they don't.  Oh, okay.  I love the old-fashioned strippers.  The burlesque.  Oh, you're talking way back.  Yeah.  What, like a feather fan dance or something?  I'm friends with the burlesque girl who...  What is that America's Got Talent?  The one who did the strip thing on Knight Rider Car.  Which one was that?  David Hasselhoff.  Michelle Lamour. 
[02:46:00]  I'm friends with her.  She's like a burlesque thing.  Is she?  Yeah, it's good.  Feathers and shit.  Oh, the feather dancing?  I don't want art in my stripping either.  I want a completely nude local girl...  Yes.  ...that is just in some shit fucking bar that could just be...  If it wasn't for girls dancing naked, it would just look like a regular bar.  I want them to be desperate for cash.  Yeah, and be desperate for cash.  Yeah.  Not have...  Low self-esteem.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's sexy.  I like walking into local strip clubs that you never know if you're going to see some destitute former classmate. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  A nice little burlesque.  I like it old school.  You have that on your iPod.  That's what I get introduced to at comedy clubs.  Oh, okay.  Do you really?  Do you pull your tits out?  Yeah.  I get people to come up on stage and shake it.  I actually think strippers are very easy to pick up in strip clubs, isn't it?  You think?  It's not difficult.  You just tell them you're a comic or something.  I think they're too jaded.  Slap the accent on a bit and you can...  Well, yeah, you with that fucking accent, I'm sure. 
[02:47:00]  Chicks like the accent.  They really do.  But the...  Which is the weird thing when Americans go...  Because you...  I don't want to tell you about America, but you hate it across the world.  Oh, I know.  It's nothing personal.  We know that.  It's nothing personal.  It's nothing personal.  You just are, right?  And now we can't even pull out the almighty dollar and try to spend it because it's not worth  the shit anywhere.  So you go off to Britain with your accent and try to pick up...  People hate it.  People hate your accent.  Yeah, in Australia...  That's why I won't work there.  I've been offered to work there.  I have no fucking desire to stand there.  Now, because guys that like fucking trash bush... 
[02:47:30]  Americans are like, yeah, Americans are stupid.  Those are the guys that the fucking British crowd's like.  Chris Rocks been over there selling big tickets.  Chris Rocks gonna break a record.  They love him over there.  Chris is Chris.  But they would love you there.  They love brash Americans out there.  Well, Doug Stanhope...  I love black guys.  Doug Stanhope sells through the roof over there.  Yeah, he sells big theater tours, Doug Stanhope.  Does he?  Yeah, Doug Stanhope's huge over there.  Mitch Hedberg is still selling out over there.  Yeah, Mitch Hedberg is very popular over there.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear English chicks can't fuck.  English chicks are the best fucks ever. 
[02:48:00]  Are, really?  Oh!  Because I hear tell they can't fuck.  No, no.  50% of them fucking take out the ass.  50%.  Easy.  Wow.  Easy, right?  It's cleaner than their pussy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The pussy's like the Tim's.  Tastes like chips.  No, they...  No, I find American women...  Like, I was in LA for a week last week.  Uh-huh.  I got, like, five or six phone numbers of girls who wanted to date me before they fucked  me.  I'm there for, like, a week.  Yeah.  I can't build up a relationship.  I'm gone on Monday. 
[02:48:30]  So you just want to fuck?  Yeah.  And then this whole thing that, like, an American girl wants to hold your hand or something like  that on the first date, and then she'll decide whether she's going to date you.  We're like, British girl will fuck you, and then decide if she's going to date you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, they're easy.  Makes a lot more sense.  No, no, I'm not...  I'm saying...  But are they any good at it?  No, they're good at it.  They're good at it?  Yeah, of course they are.  They're better than Australian birds.  Australian birds.  So...  A lot of sun.  You know something?  It doesn't taste right.  Australian chicks...  It's a weird thing.  I've been to a lot of these websites that have Australian girls on there. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Not very attractive.  A lot of them.  What the fuck is that?  It's too much sun.  Is that what it is?  It is too much sun.  They're like wallets.  They're all freckling and their skins all...  I had this one Australian bird I was fucking, and this is what she said to me.  She goes, you can put your goo on me face if you want.  How sexy is that?  You can put your goo on me face.  You can put your goo on me face.  Coo-coo-ca-choo.  That's fantastic.  Like, I did it, but you know. 
[02:49:30]  She's rubbing it in as lotion.  That's like David Tell's joke.  He's like, if God didn't want you to put it on our face, we wouldn't have made eyelids.  That's a good one.  Wow.  No, no.  Australian birds...  And they're just a bit blokey as well.  They're all into sport.  Yeah, like a little manly and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  They're tough.  I dated a cop.  My brother's a cop, right?  And he fucking set me up with some bird from his work.  Oh, a cop, bitch?  Yeah, this guy.  She was sexy, right?  She's like the road warrior. 
[02:50:00]  You know when you're laying in bed with a chick and you're like, sort of like a play  fight, just a little bit of a slap or a, you know, like you're tickling someone or  something, you know, you give her a bit of a tickle or something, and then she had  me fucking pinned on the floor with my pulling my hair back and mashing my face going, I was  going, this isn't fun.  I don't want to be in this relationship.  She can pistol whip in you like Leota.  I don't want any bitch that can fucking slap me to bits.  I like that.  I like a woman who can protect me.  Yeah.  Beat the shit out of you, though?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  And, you know, he wouldn't have to hire a bodyguard.  I've dated a couple of cops that are fucking submissive sexually.  The female cops have dated.  Really?  They like to be fucking spanked.  Oh, yeah.  You ever put a gun in her mouth?  No, I didn't act out in anything like, I don't really do role play, but I just fucking,  they like to be spanked.  No, he said he put a gun in your mouth and you said, I don't do role play.  That's just how he fucks.  Oh, you did?  That's not role play.  It's like, keep doing it or I'll blow your fucking head off.  That's weird, though, chicks from, you know, around the world like that.  Well, British women, man, they're really girly as well. 
[02:51:00]  Like, they're girly in such a slutty way.  It's all miniskirts and stiletto heels and stuff like that.  And then you get like, in Sweden, the chicks are really hot, but they fuck really shit.  They're just sort of, they're just too busy being hot.  But then you go over to Finland.  Finland girls are dynamite because they think they're inferior to Swedish chicks.  And I don't fucking care.  They look the same to me.  I was over doing gigs in Sweden and then I went and did gigs in Finland. 
[02:51:30]  And the local comics, both of them were doing a character from each other's country.  Because we don't know that they have competition with each other.  And so like in Sweden, there's this guy going, I am from Finland.  I am stupid.  I have sex with my mom.  Right?  And they're going, oh, Finnish people, aren't they cunts?  And then you go over to fucking Finland and they're going, I am sensible Swedish, man.  Look at my loafers.  I have sex with my mom.  Aren't Swedish people cunts? 
[02:52:00]  You'll fuck anybody with bad teeth.  Oh, yeah.  That's something.  Who knows?  I knew there was that rivalry going on.  Everywhere you go, there's some rivalry between something and something.  The British, they all hate each other no matter where they are.  It's not just like the Welsh and the Brits and the English and the Scots.  It's like fucking Liverpool hates Manchester with a passion.  They're like 25 miles apart.  And they fucking hate each other.  They just want to, you know.  Well, it's probably like New York and Boston. 
[02:52:30]  They fucking hate each other.  Well, what's the big deal?  The Red Sox and the Yankees.  It's that whole thing that you grow up in this world.  And it's like when you grow up in a city, you go, what part of town are you from?  And you go, oh, they're fucking rednecks.  But then when you go overseas, it's like, what country are you from?  Oh, you're Australian.  We know what they're like.  You know, there's further in.  It's like if you live in one street, you hate the fucking street next to you.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no divvying it up, I guess, when we think of other countries.  Yeah.  Because here in the States, we make fun of the South. 
[02:53:00]  And, you know, if you're from the North, if you're from the South, you make fun of.  Who do you make fun of?  I think you're at the bottom of the totem pole.  Black people.  Okay.  You can always go to black people.  My dad is a comedian in Baghdad going, these Shiite chicks, they want to date before they fuck.  I got to date a Sunni chick or a Kurd.  Kurds love it in the ass.  Half of them love it in the ass.  50 percent.  I love that.  50 percent. 
[02:53:30]  They're arguing about economics.  50 percent of British women take it up the ass.  In fact, if you're a British woman, right, phone in right now.  I imagine 50 percent of them will say they do.  I'd imagine.  Something to do with the cold.  You wouldn't want to put your dick in their mouths with all that.  The bad plaque.  The bad teeth and shit.  Get a plaque drop.  Do they still have the fucking effects of scurvy?  What the fuck?  They don't have fluoride in their water.  They think it's evil.  Is that what it is?  And they don't have ice in their drinks.  They always scoop the ice out because they're worried because their teeth are so sensitive. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, sensitive to the cold.  That's why all the drinks are really warm.  Why are the drinks really warm?  We like it that way.  No, they do.  I put in a little wasabi.  No.  They love it.  If they get a cold drink, they go, oh, my sore teeth.  And you go into a petrol station, right, and the fridges don't have fucking doors on them.  They're serving you a Coke and a Dr. Pepper out of a meat tray.  I mean, it's like the bane of my existence.  It's true. 
[02:54:30]  It's true.  That's hilarious.  Their teeth are sensitive.  Oh, no.  No, that really is the reason.  Before the smoking ban came in, the ashtrays used to just be filled with ice because you  could see cunts scooping it out with their head and going, what are these people, mental?  I can't drink that.  More teeth hurt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, they don't like it.  And they've got those rotten, yeah.  You can't tell British teeth from a mile away.  Like, in Britain, I haven't got great teeth, but in Britain, I'm like a fucking dentist  commercial.  And over here, I'm starting to think I'm like getting whitened or something. 
[02:55:00]  What the fuck?  It's like, I guess the effects of, what?  It's the effects of war.  Of war and living underground in the tube.  And some of them, they just don't brush.  Well, the tube will fuck you up, man.  Yeah.  You go to the tube, you assimilate to it very quickly, but the first couple of days, your  bogeys go black and you just go, well, that's not good.  It's just the soot and all that type of stuff.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Can I jump in here?  Jesus.  Jim Jeffries is killing. 
[02:55:30]  This guy, S.Y. from Ripe Videos, South Cal, he writes, I was about to fuck this Aussie  chick, but she was on the rag.  She said, I'm on me block, but you can up me dump.  Wow.  I can't.  All right.  I'm on me block, but you can up me dumper.  I'm on me blop.  Would that be the words?  He wrote block.  Yeah.  They're called blop.  Blop.  Yeah.  I'm on me block, but you can fuck me up me dumper.  And then he continues sick, and she also referred to her ass as her bonus hole. 
[02:56:00]  Her bonus hole.  It's like a game show.  And the bonus hole.  Wait, we got a guy going to back up Jim Jeffries.  Derek in Connecticut.  What's up, Derek?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey.  I can definitely back up Jeffries on this one.  I went to a show last week, met this English chick, had a beer with her at the end of the  show, brought her back to her hotel room, banged her, and she gave up the ass.  English chick.  Every time. 
[02:56:30]  Every time.  English chick.  What part of England is she from, mate?  You know what?  I think it was Rob.  Ass fuck Chester.  Ass fuck Chester.  I used to date a bad tooth shire.  I used to date a British girl, and she was a tremendous submissive.  She used to let me to park my car, and I would fucking bite her.  And she liked to be bitten.  Really?  I used to trap her head under my steering wheel and force her to suck my cock, and she would  be like, I want you to bite me.  She would get into these crazy little mantras, I want you to bite me. 
[02:57:00]  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  Fuck.  I suck.  I know.  Hey, why don't we move on here?  We got, well, you guys can decide here.  We got the John Dennis angry voicemail.  We're doing that war with W-E-E-I.  We got the crazy guy attacking someone with a machete, and then starts throwing firebombs off  the roof.  Yeah, I heard about him.  We got a guess the sound, and we got a guy talking about UFOs.  I like UFOs.  I like UFOs.  UFOs are fun shit.  I believe in UFOs.  It's one of the things that I do.  I enjoy talking about all this fucking. 
[02:57:30]  It's kind of interesting.  It is, too.  Yeah, but there's going to be some alien.  There's going to be some probing.  There's going to be some anal probing.  You know there always is with UFOs, because that's all they care about, aliens, is shoving  a stick up your ass.  And you know how some people like to fuck animals?  Yeah.  Wouldn't there be a couple of aliens that would come here, considering us animals, and just  want to fuck us in the ass?  And then how degraded you'd feel.  And there's that famous case in the 60s where they kidnap Betty and Barney Hill, and the 
[02:58:00]  aliens just said to Betty,  Why?  Why?  We're so disappointed in you.  Oh, God damn.  Did you just say kidnap Benny Hill?  No, Benny and Barney Hill.  It was still funny with Benny Hill.  It's a classic UFO story.  Don from PA writes, ask Jim Jeffries if he has ever glade the spoon.  Glade the spoon?  I don't know what that is.  Is that a heroin reference?  I don't know.  I don't know what glade the spoon means. 
[02:58:30]  Glade the spoon.  Glade the spoon?  Here we go, the UFO guy.  What do you think?  Do you believe in UFOs?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, sir.  Definitely.  They're out there, man.  I've seen them.  I've been out there in Aurora, Texas.  They got them little graves and stuff.  Yeah, I've been out there, and I don't know.  I'm planning a trip.  I'm planning a trip.  We're going out to Arizona or something and figure something out.  We're not Arizona.  What was it?  Yeah, it was Arizona.  The Air Force One where they found all that stuff. 
[02:59:00]  I got pictures of Aurora.  I've seen grave sites.  They're out there, man.  I'm flying in the plane.  I'm always hallucinating, but who really knows what I'm looking at?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, but there's no proof of this.  Just people's accounts.  You're right.  There's no proof.  But, I mean, there's no proof of Jesus or, you know, people go in the restroom until they tell you about it.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's just kind of the way I see things. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  So you believe it, then?  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Do you think there's, like, little green men out there?  No little green men, sir.  No?  Well, what do you think there is out there?  Who knows, dude?  They could be made of water.  I don't even know.  Water?  Water, man.  You heard the man.  Water.  They could be made of anything extraterrestrial.  Extraterrestrial.  They could be made of water and other extraterrestrial stuff.  That guy's just an ass. 
[03:00:00]  Although, I tell you one thing.  He's coming up better than that fucking dopey interviewer.  Like, little green men.  What do you think's out there?  Little green men.  What year is this?  Complete asshole.  All right.  People are begging for the John Dennis thing.  Do we know the backstory on this?  Does anyone know the backstory on this?  I think.  Who's John Dennis?  Sam!  Dennis and Callahan.  This radio show.  They took a shot at us yesterday.  Are you guys unliked in the industry?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Pretty innocent shot, but we decided to, like, go balls out because of that. 
[03:00:30]  Let's be honest.  We've done far worse to everyone else.  What happened to that big guy that used to drive the taxi that used to sit in the corner?  Oh, Big A.  Big A?  Big A, yeah.  He doesn't come in every day.  Oh, I like him.  We're going to scrape his...  Next time he comes in, we're going to scrape his tongue, though.  Did you ever get the glory hole challenge thing up and running?  No, he didn't want to do that.  But we're going to scrape his tongue because he has really bad breath, and then we're going  to have someone, like, kind of, like, probably swallow it. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, ugh.  Just as I take a bite.  That's disgusting.  Yeah.  Sam, what do you know on this Dennis and Callahan voicemail thing?  Oh, that's, uh...  Apparently, from what I gathered, he had some kind of feud with a lesser-known radio DJ  or somebody from The Edge, I think is what he said.  And this guy went up to his daughter in a bar or something and told his daughter that  he wanted to sleep with her for the scandal. 
[03:01:30]  And then his daughter went home and told him.  Oh, so he's calling because his daughter was approached?  Yes.  Okay.  And so he got super pissed.  All right.  How old's his daughter?  He didn't say.  I don't know.  Well, she's in a bar, right?  Yeah, I mean, she's dead.  Okay.  Yeah, you're allowed to sleep with these two, whatever.  Fair game.  So this is Dennis.  There's grass on the wicket.  This is Dennis from the home of the kids.  It's time to play cricket.  They got their own person in the money.  I know.  Yeah, they got grass on the infield. 
[03:02:00]  The grass on the wicket is time to play cricket.  At least that's rhymes.  Yeah.  You nicked it off us, you cunts.  You're probably right.  It's like a cultural awakening when you're here.  This is good.  So here's John Dennis leaving an angry voicemail to this guy  that approached his daughter in a bar.  Is this Rotillo or Rotillo or Rodillo or Rosillo or whoever your name is?  John Dennis calling, Rotillo. 
[03:02:30]  Two points you need to understand.  Number one, I don't know who the fuck you are or what it is you do.  I guess you're on the zone.  And I guess you're a radio wannabe.  Beyond that, I've never heard a word out of your mouth.  I don't know who the hell you are.  And I don't even know what you do.  I'm wondering if you're still hungover or were you so drunk and thrown up last night 
[03:03:00]  that you even remember any of these conversations.  So let me tell you a couple things.  I don't know who the hell you are.  I don't give a shit who you are.  But I guess you're hitting on my daughter and saying I want to be with you and create a scandal.  I'll tell you what.  You want to create a scandal, why don't you, as like half my age, what are you, late 20s?  I'm early 50s. 
[03:03:30]  You want to create a scandal?  Why don't you come and find me and I'll rip your fucking ears off and your nose off  and I'll shove them up your ass and kick your balls up around your head.  That would create a scandal.  You want to be in the eye column?  Well, I'm obviously showing his age.  Wow.  It's not even rip your head off.  I'm going to rip your ears.  Why you?  Why?  And you know.  You're done, kid.  By the time I'm done, you might be able to wear glasses.  What I'm going to do to you.  Let's go.  Oh, aye, aye. 
[03:04:00]  Let's go to Rusty in Boston.  You whippersnapper?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Jimmy, you're great.  Loved you last time you were in town.  Hey, guys, actually, that guy that John Dennis went after was working for the Patriots.  He had just signed on to do the Patriots pregame and postgame.  And when this scandal broke, John Dennis was so into the Patriots that he got him fired  before he even started.  What?  Yeah, that's what happened.  It was a big story here about two years ago.  Right.  And it was just all over the place.  And this guy, you can't even hear from him again. 
[03:04:30]  He just fell off the face of the earth.  He's that powerful?  Well, at the time.  Yeah, we'll see how powerful he is.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Thank you, Rusty.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  More of the back story.  Flip your fucking ears off and your nose off, and I'll shovel up your ass and kick your  balls up around your head.  And shit down your mother's throat.  You want to be in the I column?  You want to create a scandal?  You want to be something other than some jag off on the zone?  Jag off.  Jag off.  Why don't you all see me face to face? 
[03:05:00]  I drive a jag off.  Seconds.  Tell me I'm Ryan Rotello, or whatever the fuck your name is.  I'll kick your balls up around your ass.  You can go to the hospital.  Then we'll create a scandal.  Do you remember any of this from last night?  Do you remember any of this from last night?  Give me a call.  Go ahead and give me a call.  All right, I don't get it.  I don't get why a guy in his late 20s texts a girl in her early 20s and says, I'd like 
[03:05:30]  to be with you.  I'd like to cause a scandal.  I send worse texts than that on a daily basis.  Right.  Like, what's so bad about that?  It's not like, I want to fist you until I lose me watch.  You know what I mean?  Now, that would upset the father.  Yeah, yeah.  But just, I want to cause a scandal.  It's almost romantic.  Almost.  Well, it continues, right?  The voicemail goes on forever?  No, that's the long track and then I cut it up for you.  Oh, okay.  So that's it?  All right, good.  Thank God.  So there you go.  First of all, he's going to kick his balls up around his head and then the balls were 
[03:06:00]  going to be kicked up around his eyes.  Yeah, I was trying to figure out and like picture it all.  In high school, it reminds me of another high school story yet today.  It reminds me of when we used to torture this one kid, our buddy's little brother.  We would torture him.  He was very quiet.  He was just one of those nerds.  Every day in the library, we would just torture him with spitballs and pranks and fucking  with him.  And one day in the middle of the library, he just couldn't take it anymore.  Big fat guy.  He put his hand on his hips and he screamed up to the balcony.  He's like, why don't you go home and piss up your mother's ass? 
[03:06:30]  That's a good one.  Gotta give that.  I was like, yeah, original.  Piss up your mother's ass.  What happened to that guy?  Did he have a good life or did he kill himself?  I'm sure he killed himself.  That sounds like a father who, he's a little too close to what the daughter's doing.  Very protective.  A little too protective with her like that.  Matt LaFarre writes, fucking old bastard, I'll throw out your Mickey Mantle baseball card. 
[03:07:00]  He's cock blocking is what he is.  Tim from Columbus, you didn't leave your number.  How's he supposed to call you back?  It's also the thing, I don't know who you are.  How do you know he's not a nice guy?  Yeah, this guy might be a good guy.  And Blue Heeler from Kentucky, new O&A t-shirt.  We're always looking for that next O&A t-shirt, Jim Jeffries.  And this guy writes, I want to fist you until I lose me watch.  Should be the next Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  But no one will understand the me.  We have Oliver.  Why do we have to take another?  We don't.  Oh, we never broke? 
[03:07:30]  No.  Well, we left for a leak and they didn't break?  No.  No, we were riffing.  That's how we got on the chicks in England.  Take it up the ass.  Riffing.  Oh, dang.  Don't talk about the old poof shoot.  We had the Olive Who stuff, too.  You got a little taste of that there, Butcher?  From a little earlier.  All right.  I'll tell you this.  This one, Jimmy.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive Who. 
[03:08:00]  Olive until they learn to detect this condition in the womb.  I didn't even see your lips move.  I got the hangover.  You want me to try it again?  All right.  Knock, knock.  Who's there? 
[03:08:30]  Olive.  Olive Who.  Olive for as long as my family doesn't get sick of me spoiling every photograph.  Oh, gosh.  Olive.  Are we done, or do you have one more?  I don't know.  Anybody else want to chime in with one?  Can't top those.  Can't top those.  Hey, Ben in Connecticut is on the line. 
[03:09:00]  Is that it?  What's your?  Hot off the mic.  Okay, for now.  That was a little taste.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  We'll take your break there, Stan.  Okay.  We'll continue with Jim Jeffries, who's going to be at Caroline's in New York City starting  tomorrow night through the weekend.  And Jeffrey Ross is going to be at Governor's on Long Island.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  One night.  Just tonight.  Tonight I go to Seattle.  And then what?  You fly out?  Yeah, I'm going to L.A. for a couple of days. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, look at you.  Seattle.  Look at you.  Look at you.  I'm on my own tour for you guys.  The O&A Jeff Ross solo tour.  All your big cities.  Nice.  You have great fans, by the way.  If you guys say go, they go.  Of course they do.  It's crazy.  They're very supportive of what we do.  We like that.  It's a stamp of approval.  Yeah.  We should acknowledge that more, that they really do support all of us.  There's a certain amount of loyalty.  Fuck them.  I haven't got some.  What happened there? 
[03:10:00]  What happened?  Oh, we're still on the air?  Dalet, man.  Dalet's killing me.  What?  Are we talking?  Dalet's killing you.  The what?  Dalet's killing him.  Yo, Dalet.  Yo, Dalet.  What's up?  Want to try again?  Are we going to break?  Give me three seconds.  One.  Two.  This is good radio.  Three.  Yeah.  Not working, dude. 
[03:10:30]  I'm hitting the play button and nothing is happening.  What are you trying to play?  Yes.  Are we on the air?  Yeah.  Yes.  How do you know we're on the air, though?  Yeah.  We're on the air, Mark.  What?  Because he hasn't hit the button.  Steve, are we on the air?  He's going to set the commercial button.  I think we are.  Steve?  Should someone say something funny?  I'm not going to say anything funny unless you know we're on the air.  I've got to reboot Dalet.  Why would I...  Yeah.  I don't want to do your best work in the gym, do you?  Yeah.  Why would I waste a line on five guys?  Damn.  That was a funny line. 
[03:11:00]  Can we just...  Steve, are we on the air?  Why don't we just go to commercial and you restart it during that?  Oh.  Steve, are we on the air?  Can you hit the button?  I'm going to try again right now.  All right, we're going to try to go to break.  Every knee must bend, every head must bow, every tongue must confess, thou art the greatest,  the greatest of all time.  Ella, Ella, A, A.  Yeah, we suck.  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  Ah, Opie and Anthony, Jim Jeffries, Jeffrey Ross, and of course, Jim Norton. 
[03:11:30]  Jim Jeffries was talking about soccer.  We're just, you know, throwing the ball around a little bit during the break.  I don't get soccer.  We've talked about it many, many times on our show, and, you know, he's basically saying  greatest sport in the world.  Nice, beautiful sport.  Lovely.  And when you walk around downtown on, like, weekends here in New York City, it's a thing 
[03:12:00]  to do.  You get on a dumb subway, you walk around down there, because there's a lot more going on  down there.  I told you that when they got these soccer games going on, not only the pubs, the bars  just completely packed to the point you can't move inside them.  You can see the people, they're almost piled up on each other.  Not only is that happening, people are piling up against the windows outside to get a peek  at the game that's going on inside.  Do you think they're mostly English people who live in New York, or do you think that  is, like, people who want to be a bit chic and watch football?  I really don't know. 
[03:12:30]  I would imagine it's a bit of both.  Real fans.  I think it's real fans.  I think the reason, I like it, man.  I like how they're all punching the can out of each other at football matches and all  that.  It's a great sport.  It's tense.  I love sports.  I've tried to, like, enjoy soccer.  I just don't get it.  There's nothing better than a goal.  You can score basketball and all that, or hitting a home run.  There's nothing better than a cracking goal.  It just happens once every three weeks.  Exactly.  That's why they're so good.  The tension.  What, the build-up?  Yeah, that's why there's fights, because a goal means so much. 
[03:13:00]  They just, you know, you mightn't score the whole game.  People get very tense, and they just want to punch each other.  I just think it's a great place, because there's like 80,000 of them are fucking, it's  just brutal.  They're fucking brutal.  They talk about Americans being fucking pigs and all that stuff.  Everywhere in the world, soccer fans are like, there's shit.  If you go to the games, it's home and away seating, so you can't sit next.  If you're, like, say, if your mate's a Manchester fan and you're an Arsenal fan, you can't sit  next to each other.  That's not allowed.  And then there's, like, buried-off areas where the cops, not just security, the cops stand 
[03:13:30]  between the two crowds to make sure they don't start hitting each other.  The fact that that has to happen.  That is pretty impressive.  They have this thing in Britain called Premier League All-Stars, which is like, they get  half celebrities and half ex-professional players to play, right?  And so I went along and played for Fulham, because I'm a fan of Fulham.  They're, like, coming second last in the league, this shit, right?  But they gave me a jersey with my name on it.  It said Jeffries. 
[03:14:00]  And I was like, it was like a kid's dream, right?  So I put my jersey on, I go play the game, I'm shit, I'm awful, I'm no good.  People were booing me and stuff.  It was terrible.  But then, like, the next week or so, I decided I'm going to go see an actual Fulham game,  so I wear my new jersey.  But I don't think about it.  Like, I'm slightly famous, and I've got a jersey with my name on it.  I look like a fucking child.  Like, you know when people go, like, put my name on it?  I don't want, like, a professional person's name.  I wanted everyone to know that I'm a celebrity and look at my name. 
[03:14:30]  I had to leave that one early.  It wasn't just people behind me saying,  Jeffries, you cunt.  Jeffries, you fucking cunt.  They've written songs.  Or worse yet, they thought you were just some bloke who wanted to dress up like Jeffries.  Yeah, Jeffries, some, like, minor fourth division player.  He started for five minutes for Fulham once and tripped over and shat himself.  And the other thing you were talking about during the break was smoking.  And there's a new term called smerting? 
[03:15:00]  Smerting's a term that's been put into Britain.  It's just been put in the dictionary, which is smoking and flirting put together.  Hold on, can I back up a minute?  Somebody, Randy from New Orleans, how do you like hockey and not soccer?  You can't even compare the two.  Different things get dope.  I love hockey because of all the hitting that's going on.  I don't like going to hockey games for the skill for the most part.  I like some good hitting.  And I'm weird, too, when, like, the Islanders and the Rangers play.  That's a big rivalry.  When a Ranger gets a good hit on one of my boys, I get excited. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I should be yelling and screaming at the Ranger, but I'm like, wow, that was a good hit.  I'm all about the hits.  Because you know there's going to be a comeback.  Yeah.  I like the hitting and I like the fighting in hockey.  I can get on board with hockey, but I grew up in Australia, so there's no fucking ice.  So how am I going to get excited about that?  Anyway, back to smirting.  I'm sorry.  Well, no, smirting's just smoking and flirting.  And when the smoking bank came in, more people started smoking because you could pick up chicks a lot easier.  Because when you're in a club or something, you can't talk to them. 
[03:16:00]  But as soon as you go outside and she's smoking, and statistically, a woman who smokes is a lot trashier than a standard chick  and will sleep with you on the first date.  So these are the quality women.  And there's that little bond that smokers have when you get outside where you go,  We're out here.  They don't let us indoors anymore.  And then you can finger her or something.  You can get some of that flirting done.  But they've brought that law in all across Britain.  You can't smoke anywhere indoors.  Is that the same here, right?  For the most part, yeah.  We're just about at that point. 
[03:16:30]  They've got signs up still in Britain everywhere that says no smoking.  But once it's the law, it's the fucking law.  I don't need a sign.  I'm not a fucking child.  It's not like they put a sign up for every bloody law then.  Have no smoking and no rape in here.  Don't rape people.  That's frowned upon in our establishment.  You know how insane they got with the smoking band here in New York City?  I can speak for New York City.  There was a place we went.  It was a cigar bar.  My old boss loved going in there for a cigar and a drink. 
[03:17:00]  It was a good social thing.  They had the big comfy couches.  We would go in there once in a while to have some wine, just mellow out or whatever.  Or they banned cigar smoking in a cigar bar.  What?  When people are going out of their way to smoke in these things.  You know what you're getting into when you go to the cigar bar.  That's pretty much the reason you're going to a cigar bar.  And they even were able to shut down most of those.  You could go into a smoke shop that sells cigars and still smoke.  But what's the fun in that?  Is there anywhere indoors in New York? 
[03:17:30]  Fryer's Club.  Fryer's Club.  You could still smoke inside?  Certain rooms, certain times.  They had to put sand on the floor?  No, they do in L.A.  It was a fire hazard, they say.  Sand on the floor.  They had a whole room that was with sand on the floor.  It's crazy.  I don't know.  I guess you could fire poop.  They just let half the fryers fart and sand it up on the floor anyway.  It's probably so those old fucks could shuffle on the floor.  It was always a fire hazard.  Help them out a little bit.  Give them a little.  Or so they pissed their pants and just kind of fucking little.  There's nothing better than sitting around with your homies smoking a cigar. 
[03:18:00]  When are we going to go to the Fryer's Club?  I want to check that place out.  What's a Fryer's Club?  Let's go for lunch Friday.  You'll be back in town Friday?  I'll be here.  I thought you were leaving, leaving.  No, I'm here till Friday.  I'm going to leave.  I'll go Friday.  I want to check out that joint.  I'm having a meeting there today for lunch and I'd love to take you guys on Friday as  my guest.  That'd be fun for me.  What is the Fryer's Club?  What is it?  No, you'll be all right at lunchtime.  All right.  It's where all the old comedians hang out.  You're invited.  I'll get a big table.  I want to go to the Fryer's Club.  That was an insult to Jeffrey Ross, but I mean, most of the guys are really old, right? 
[03:18:30]  Well, it's interesting.  There's no kids allowed in the club, but there's still a diaper changing station in the men's  room.  Is there a youth movement going on with this place?  There's a lot of younger people coming in.  It's not the way it used to be.  That stigma's sort of over.  I think the roasts have made it cooler.  What do you do there?  Hang out and just tell you jokes?  Yeah.  You know, you can get a steam.  You can get something to eat.  You can play some pool.  You can play some poker.  You know.  It's just like hanging out in a, yeah, like kind of a restaurant bar atmosphere. 
[03:19:00]  But everybody knows your name.  It's like, it's very, it's chummy.  Yeah.  It's old school.  All right.  And then, oh, getting back to the smoking thing, you said that people start smoking because  of the smoking ban.  The smoking actually went up because you could pick up chicks more if you were a smoker.  Because then you had an excuse to be outside on the sidewalk.  And then there's nothing more romantic than getting a bird and then giving up smoking together.  Nice.  All right.  We got, we got, it's like you fixed each other.  We got a guess the sound from Pat Duffy. 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  We like to do this from time to time.  Pat Duffy.  Guess the sound.  Ah!  Ow!  You're right.  There you go.  What is that?  It sounded like.  Ah!  Ow!  You're right.  It could be anything.  It sounds like some type of electrocution.  Somebody got hit with something.  Bear trap.  A bear trap.  Or, um.  Uh. 
[03:20:00]  A basketball bouncing off someone's face.  Hmm.  Yeah, it did sound like that.  Yeah.  It sounded like somebody got a shock.  It did sound like electric.  Do we have the actual answer?  Oh, I know this.  Play it one more time.  I know this.  You do?  Yes.  Um, yeah, we do have the answer.  Okay.  We'll let everyone know in May.  Oh.  What?  That's crazy.  Right.  Well.  It's called TSL.  Ah!  Ow!  You're right.  A woman reading. 
[03:20:30]  Somebody just got spoozed on her.  What was it?  Goo on her poo?  Goo on her face?  Goo on her face.  I think it sounds like she's given birth and the baby's hung itself on the umbilical cord.  I want to go back to a woman reading.  It means nothing.  It's completely the opposite sound of what you heard.  We had completely the opposite response of what was wrong for it.  Okay.  That was Jim Norton pulling it.  Oh, that was generous.  I thought it was all right, Jim.  Thank you, Jim.  I thought it was all right.  One comic sees another comic fucking falling off a cliff. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  Finally, crazy guy.  Can we talk about it in the Fry's Club?  Yeah.  We got the crazy guy that decided to, I don't know, live Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it sounds like here.  It sounds like this guy likes Grand Theft.  A 21-year-old man is undergoing a mental evaluation after terrorizing a queen's neighborhood.  Police say the suspect began his spree with a machete attacking a man exiting a subway station  at around 5.30 yesterday in Richmond Hill. 
[03:21:30]  The 45-year-old victim was able to fend himself off and suffered only a few cuts to the head.  Cops say his attacker then ran into a nearby building where he started throwing Molotov cocktails off the roof.  Molotov cocktails.  Did he have a bazooka?  No.  How many stars did he have on him?  Right.  I'm going to guess.  Is the chopper going after him?  I'm going to guess four stars on that, right?  Four stars on that one.  You throw a Molotov cocktail at a cop car.  Machete then goes on the roof and starts throwing the... 
[03:22:00]  Machete.  Yeah, the firebombs.  He should have grabbed a machine gun down at Ammunation.  Yeah.  I don't know what he was thinking.  He went inside this yellow house, and then people didn't know where he was.  When I walked out, he was just throwing firebombs down from the rooftop.  I was going to throw at least three of them.  One firebomb hit an unmarked police car and set it on fire, but nobody was hurt.  The man surrendered to police after nearly a two-hour standoff.  Cops say he blamed the incident on having a bad day.  He's got to be let out, but he's going to lose all of his weapons. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  He'll just be standing outside, shuffling about in front of the police station.  No weapons.  Grab a cab.  Start picking people up.  It takes forever for a stupid car to come by so he can...  Jack on your game.  I like when you have to run after it, and it's like, oh, it's going a little too fast.  No, everyone just goes to the same bit where you had all the weapons.  No one goes back and buys them all again.  Oh, no.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, well, people want to guess the sound. 
[03:23:00]  We got Rick in Florida.  Rick, you want to play guess the sound?  Yeah, I got a guess for today's sound.  All right.  It's a woman having her hat removed.  We're having her hat removed.  We're having her hat removed.  Ah!  Ow!  What?  Having her hat removed or a head?  Well, why don't you turn to your left?  Jim Jeffries, we're going to see how sick you are.  This is a story.  The lady...  Hold on.  Before you play this.  What is this?  Let me do the setup.  A lady just wanting to get some fresh air. 
[03:23:30]  I believe she's 100.  Yeah.  She's 100 years old.  She's got a walker, and that's an intruder to the right.  So you can barely see him there.  A fine young black gentleman.  Yes.  And he...  Well, I guess...  What's he trying to do?  He works for the Susquehanna Hat Company, and she's late on her hat payments.  So he had to repossess the hat.  Yes, her hat was overdue.  Remember, she's 100 years old. 
[03:24:00]  She's 101.  She's 101.  And that hat is annoying him that it's on her head.  Do you know how many people want that hat?  Does she got a hat on?  Of course she does.  It's almost...  The tenement was stolen hat.  You'll notice her hat.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let her rep.  Fucking Phil Donahue hairdo.  He's not done.  She doesn't know to just stand there.  Look, she bends over to try to grab whatever's under her walker.  She's like, let me get this. 
[03:24:30]  You're not too bad.  Watch her fucking Frank...  See what I'm going to get...  Oh, girl.  Look at the walker wheels.  Look at the wheels.  That a fucking...  That a t-shirt.  Or a fucking Frank Vincent wig.  Look at that.  This tape is called...  This tape is called Rich Vos trying to get paid a governor. 
[03:25:00]  We 100% show this is real.  This isn't funny.  Oh, it's absolutely real.  The guy got arrested and everything.  Watch her hair fluff out.  Watch her hair fluff out with watch.  These guys...  You're insane, man.  I don't know why the fuck that is so funny.  Her hair puffs out.  He...  He claws.  I love Jim Jeffries' part of the club.  You guys are insane. 
[03:25:30]  You guys are wrong.  I love the hair fluff.  What's the hair?  Oh, the hair is the greatest.  When the hell did this happen?  Just keep playing it over and over again.  When the hell did this happen?  Look at this.  Here we go.  Oh!  Oh, there you have it.  Oh, there she goes down.  He's jabbing her.  Why does he need to knock her over?  Because she didn't pay for her hat. 
[03:26:00]  I have a feeling...  Those hat payments are late, Jeff.  This is so awesome.  I have a feeling the old broad used the N-word somewhere in there.  Because he was ready to leave.  No!  I think you're right.  I think he was provoked.  Give me that hat, bitch!  That is the worst clip to laugh at ever.  That is the fucking greatest.  That is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  You can't stop watching it and laugh.  Look at her hair puff out.  Here it comes.  I like that building point.  Watch her head when he goes down again for the other shot. 
[03:26:30]  She goes, down goes Frazier!  What?  Here she goes, let me get this.  What did you say?  Down goes Frazier!  There is a moment where he goes, what did you say?  What the fuck did you say?  What did you say?  Go back to this.  Take that with you.  Here we go.  This bit.  What did you say?  Bam!  Clash.  Oh, she capsized.  She went down like a bag of burden. 
[03:27:00]  Stay down, Rock.  He's a crushing machine.  He'll knock your hat off.  Your walker wheels will be spinning into tomorrow.  Now switch back to Southpaw, old lady.  That fucking hairdo.  Oh, how it just puffs. 
[03:27:30]  Oh!  There comes my hat.  Her hat is off.  Stop the fight.  Someone stop the fight.  This is horrible.  What's in her pocket?  What could she possibly have?  I don't know.  Let's go to the tail of the tape, ladies and gentlemen.  Her reach is 26 inches.  His, 85.  There's a little bit after he punches her where he tries to hold her still up.  Like he tries to, I don't fool her. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, fuck it.  She's down.  I didn't want to hit you that hard.  I just wanted to punch a hundred year old woman in the face.  Her head as she's going down is fucking, it shouldn't be funny.  But there's something about her head.  Watch her head.  Ross, help me over here.  Oh, it's awful.  I instigated him.  You are so.  Come on, help me over here.  She goes sideways.  She falls sideways.  It's the greatest example. 
[03:28:30]  Guys, guys.  This is somebody's great, great, great, great grandmother.  Great word of that, bitch.  This is, it's the greatest, it's the greatest example of somebody falling ever.  There's never been a better fall.  It's because the Zimmer frame makes her fall even slower.  That's what's great about it.  That's great.  Come on, guys.  Can she listen?  We have now seen it easily a hundred more times.  What a creep.  How many times do you guys need to see this?  You know who it is?  She looks like Mickey from the top. 
[03:29:00]  Hey, Rock.  Get off my hat.  Can I see the interview?  Rock Clubber Lang has hit me.  What?  After the clip, there's footage on YouTube of her being interviewed afterwards.  Have we seen this?  I don't know if we ever played the interview on the show.  Hey, really fast.  We got a guy.  I just want to see her face.  I just want to see her.  Oh, she has a few bruises.  You can see her face.  That's so funny.  I got something from Columbus here.  Tim H. from Columbus writes,  What the black guy said to the 101-year-old woman in the hat was, 
[03:29:30]  that's what you get for faking a heart attack on the radio, you old man.  Wow.  There was a picture of her all bruised up and everything.  It takes a bit of the charm away.  It's nice and black and white.  It seems like an old black and white film.  You should have that piano playing in the background.  What's that?  You called me a what?  He does.  He leans into her like he's going to tell her a secret. 
[03:30:00]  Here you go.  I got something for you.  I got five secrets.  They're all shaped like knuckles.  Oh, is he just bashing her?  Her fucking hair.  What a full head of hair she has.  Oh, I know.  Look at her.  Hold her cheek.  God damn it.  I'll just take that out of your pocket.  There you go.  Take in this.  What do you got a necklace?  What did you call me?  And wait.  Why does that make me laugh? 
[03:30:30]  That should be its own TV channel.  That should be its own TV channel.  Just over and over.  It's so heinous.  And at 9 o'clock, down she goes.  9.15, down she goes.  It shouldn't be funny.  No.  It's horrible.  It's beyond funny though.  Oh my God.  She looks like Donahue. 
[03:31:00]  That's what she looks like.  No, no, no, no.  They're the picture of her.  What is it?  First punch, that hat goes like a UFO.  Spinning off her head.  That's why they took the hat back.  She didn't care for it properly.  She didn't pull apart.  Hat repossession.  And then she goes, I'm voting for Clinton.  Bang.  There it is.  She's down.  That's right.  I take a nap.  Holy shit.  Those wheels are spinning.  Thank God that's not real. 
[03:31:30]  There she is.  Let's take a look at her.  Let's hear the news story.  Let's take a look at her.  We got to do a thing.  We got to do a thing.  Oh God, is that fucking funny.  I don't know why.  It's so goddamn funny.  What do you mean you don't know why?  It's primitive.  It's a big black guy punching a 101-year-old woman.  How many excuses for funny do you need?  At what stage can you go, oh, all right, it's funny now? 
[03:32:00]  The irony is she won 10 grand on America's Funniest Funniest Home Videos.  They put in a boing sound effect.  Benny Hill music.  The two of them are sitting in the audience when they went.  Waving sob bruised up.  He pops or he can.  He's waving in cuffs over his head.  He actually just walks back in and goes, April Fool's.  I'm not even a mugger.  I'm just a bit of a prick.  All right, here's the interview.  I said mugger, not...  Oh, of course. 
[03:32:30]  You ready?  Here's the interview.  ...women in Queens.  One of the victims, if you can believe it, is more than 100 years old.  CBS 2's McGee Hickey is live in Jamaica Estates this morning with a story.  McGee, what kind of guy does this?  That's just my question to you, Christian.  What type of person would beat up a 100-year-old woman?  We're about to show you a surveillance tape of that type of person.  It happens right here in the lobby of the building behind me.  And police want everyone's help in finding this thief.  It'd be great if it happened to her right there. 
[03:33:00]  It's a new low for praying on the helpless.  This is from the organization.  101-year-old Rose Morat.  He helps her with the door.  Hats for the elderly.  Hats for Highland Avenue apartment building.  When police say a man offered to help her, using his pink bike to prop open the door.  But instead, he turns around and hits her repeatedly on the head.  Takes her purse, then knocks her down.  There's a fracture there.  Look what was done to Rose Morat's face.  She is battered and bruised, but still feisty.  He doesn't want me up there.  He wants me down here.  The reporter's just punched him. 
[03:33:30]  Survived a savage attack.  The disturbing security camera footage is something police want you to see.  Oh, yeah.  To find the guy.  It hit me right here.  And the blood just shot out of my mouth.  But what about the hat?  Police describe the suspect as in his 30s.  No race.  No race.  For a trim and riding a pinkish red bike.  It's actually a description of you, Jim.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  It could be anyone.  Well, you got that. 
[03:34:00]  Let's say half an hour later, a man matching the description came to the hillside apartment  building of another woman a half mile away and attacked 85-year-old Solange Lisey, who  like Rose, uses a walker.  Please have photos of this.  Oh, God.  A lot of blood coming out of my mouth.  She wasn't looking good before the attack.  That one.  Fucking man up.  Below she did and ran up the stairs, confronting her at her apartment door.  He got her wedding ring and $45. 
[03:34:30]  I could ask him if he doesn't have a murder, a grandmother, too.  What?  Great success.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  I'm praying for him.  You deserve it.  Second World War.  What can you do with a man like that?  The man must be a sick man.  Look at that hair.  Oh.  He must be.  Well, both women were hospitalized for a few days, but clearly they are back feeling fine  and feisty, and one of the women said if he had only asked for the money, they would  have both just given it to him.  Oh, sure.  No time committed.  We're live in the Jamaica estate section of Queens. 
[03:35:00]  McGee Hickey, CBS 2 News.  I'd love to know why they-  No, thanks a lot, McGee, if you're interested in seeing justice.  I know.  I also like if he only-  That's weird.  If he only just gave- asked for the money, we would have given it to him.  Don't you get it?  He likes punching old chicks.  It wasn't about the money.  It's not just about the money.  Come on.  You don't get 10 million hits on YouTube unless you're awesome.  He wanted money.  I would have fucked him, but he wanted money.  I haven't gotten laid since 1942. 
[03:35:30]  Let's do lying today.  Get the fuck out of here.  That hat just frisbeeing off her head like that was-  And her hair, her full head of hair, just fucking coming back.  Oh, wonderful.  Very David Bowie-looking hairdo.  That fuck-  Why?  Someone pointed out, Andy Warhol.  Andy Warhol.  Yeah, it's like Andy Warhol's being beaten.  It's the way AIDS treated Warhol.  Just fucking beat him up.  All right.  Let me leave.  What?  Excuse me. 
[03:36:00]  You lay there.  I have some luggage to throw around.  What'd you call me, bitch?  I said mugger.  Mugger.  Not-  You nasty mugger.  You lay down.  I'm going to go do some sign language.  You wigaboo.  Oh, it just went up to five?  When the hell did this happen?  Oh, fuck.  What happened?  Well, now the runner-ups is up to five.  Oh, shit.  It went from two to three to five really fast.  Line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasySports.net.

[03:37:30]  Rocky and I have a lot in common.  We're both fighting a ****.  That was a good one.  That was a doozy.  I'm doing research for a book that'll never see the light of day.  It's called Beyond Blue Balls.  Here's the blue ball wizard.  Here's the rest of the brownie.  That was a nice.  We had a nice.  Yeah, a little bit of assist.  That was a 50-50.

Terry Clifford fucking is fantastic.

We're both sitting on the couch, just polite, polite, polite. 
[03:39:00]  And the dog runs over, who I've never met.  And he's just licking, licking, licking, licking, licking, licking, licking, licking, licking my finger.  And they're like, oh, Ralphie loves you.  He doesn't like anybody.  Oh, my God.  Budgie, budgie, budgie.  Yeah.  That's great.  The roast master scores again.  Jeffrey Ross with line of the day.  Governors tonight out there on Long Island.  Oh, I got to say, Anthony's tagline.  And then the dog ran over and started licking the father's finger. 
[03:39:30]  Was that in there?  No.  Cut it short before that.  That's all right.  That's okay.  That was just a great story.  Shit.  I'm going to try that tonight.  That's so fucking funny.  That was a really good story.  That's a true one.  He likes you.  True, true, true.  Yeah, he does, huh?  Let's see.  Oh, we got 63% of the vote over the morning coffee.  Oh, look at that.  What is the show called?  Morning Coffee Club.  Ugh.  Look at her face.  Look at her face.  Uh-oh. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, the guy in the middle.  Uh-oh.  Crazy day.  This was fun today.  So they're losing?  When the hell did this happen?  Jim, it's nice to meet you in person.  Oh, thank you.  It's nice to meet you, too.  Thanks for all the cultural awakening that we learned.  Yeah, that was good.  We learned a lot about chicks from around the world.  We learned a lot about where that came from.  I bet.  I've got three or four other facts.  Give us one more before we leave.  I can't recall.  I've got them written in a book. 
[03:40:30]  Do you really?  Nah.  Do you ever have a French girl?  I've had French girls, yeah.  What do they like?  They're all right.  They've got a bit hairy downstairs, a French girl.  Yeah, they don't...  I've had a few French girls.  I like French-Canadian women.  They're good.  Yeah?  Yeah, I dig them.  You like them?  I like them.  They're like French girls, but they're not cunts.  The French aren't nice people.  French-Canadian girls in Montreal are the prettiest women in the world.  They're the prettiest women in the world, man.  What about just Canadian girls?  Any good?  No, they're not French-Canadian.  They're wearing like turtlenecks and stuff. 
[03:41:00]  They're always covered in so many layers.  You've got to vote for y'all to meet a wife.  I mean, the women are...  The women are...  Montreal, unjaded, beautiful.  Emily Larravee-Tirajou.  I know you've got a boyfriend now, but if you ever leave him, that was a wonderful time  we had.  I adore you, and I'm still Facebooking you, and I know I shouldn't.  All right.  That's too true.  I think I've just shot myself in the foot.  Why don't we do the quick out today? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, let's do that.  We'll literally do that.  Jim Jeffries, Caroline, starting tomorrow.  Give me my truck up.  Oh, thanks.  Jeff Ross tonight.  Planet Governors.  Next week in Giggles in Seattle, and then hitting Hilarities in Cleveland.  Come on down.  And I'm hitting Chicago, Detroit.  Oh, I hate that club.  The name.  Just the name.  I don't know.  What can you do, man?  I'm hitting Chicago, Detroit, and here at Caroline's by MySpace, bitch.  Okay.  Jim Norton.  Jesus, what are you?  Got spina bifida?  Shut up.  You're plugging your dates like you're going to an electric chair. 
[03:42:00]  Maury Povich's progeria kid special.  Yeah, we're tired today, Jeffrey.  Yeah, I'm fighting with my chick.  I'm just very tired.  I was all night having a party, Jimmy.  What happened?  What?  You should have brought this up earlier.  What happened?  No, I was rubbing a little shit.  She was punched by a black man in the corridor.  Exactly.  She fucking...  She got the white wig dirty that I bought her.  And she lost the hatch.  He got it for Christmas.  Why are you fighting, Jimmy?  Too much fighting with you two.  We had a scheduling thing yesterday that was fucking... 
[03:42:30]  It was just kind of...  I thought she wasn't trying to avoid me.  And we were arguing at night, and I just fucking hung up on her.  And I felt bad.  So I had to email apologize.  Sounds like you're close with all the emailing and phoning.  I know.  Face to face.  Yeah, let's get...  Yeah, we'll do this tomorrow.  And I fucked her friend.  Who would that be?  Have you ever done that? 
[03:43:00]  Have you ever fucked a girlfriend's friend?  No, none of them would.  No, yeah, I've never done that either.  Robert.  I once had a mate's girlfriend try to show me.  What's up?  Guy.  Doesn't have to be a girl.  Norton met his girlfriend last night at the Autism Speaks benefit.  Autism Awareness.  If you throw a ball at a kid, and it bounces off his nose, consider him a member of the club.  How fucking hard is that to figure out?  And consider him aware. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, god damn.  Yell boo.  If he doesn't blink, you got one.  Fucking sit him in the window with a fucking flashlight in his mouth for Halloween.  Oh, but we've already given the award away for Best Lines.  Oh, shit.  This always happens.  Oh, that's horrible.  I concede, I concede.  Oh, fucking hell, man.  I wish there was Halloween in Britain so I could nick that off you.  Nick that off you.  No, nick, right?  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Give it to her in the dumper.  Yeah, give it to her in the dumper.  Oi, you fucking slag.  Take it up, you fucking shitter.  Slag.  I like the term slag.  Yeah.  Yeah, slag, scrubber.  Scrubber?  You say scrubber?  No, we're a slut, whore.  Slut, whore?  Slut?  Yeah, slut, whore.  What else?  Cum dumpster.  Cum dumpster.  Hillary?  I don't know.  Well, the big C word, you know.  Cunt.  The big C, I just said cum dumpster. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, cum dumpster.  Oh, no, no, but I mean, you know, when you guys say cunt, it's a...  Cunt, yeah.  Yeah, it's a good word.  It's endearing.  I say it on stage.  They lose it for the little first bit at the beginning, but then they warm to it.  Yeah.  I don't mind being called cunts, they're all right with it.  Yeah.  I called a lady a cunt the other night.  Ooh.  Whilst you're on stage?  Yeah, she was just unnecessarily interruptive.  So what'd you do?  She was just like, I did some joking.  It's like, why don't you ever come over for dinner anymore?  I did so. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, she's just heckling me, and she's like, don't be a faggot.  And I was like, lady, I don't use slurs like that.  I try to dance a word, dance around words, so don't be a cunt.  It was just as simple.  Yeah, see, cunt's less offensive than the word faggot.  Is it?  Yeah, faggot's the way more.  Yeah.  Because it depends on who you're calling it.  And now look, bitch is making a comeback.  Tina Fey and Hillary are like embracing their inner bitch.  That's their whole campaign thing.  Yeah.  That's their whole thing, right?  Ah, there's only one word I want to make a comeback. 
[03:45:30]  That's right.  But it will never really go away.  Come on, bring it on back.  As long as you keep acting that way, it'll never really...  What's the word?  What's the word?  What do you want to bring back?  It's the only word you can't say anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Even on this station.  Oh, the N.  Rhymes with mugger.  The N word.  Although, I can't say it here, but on my drive home, I'll probably say it 20, 30 times.  Didn't we get in trouble last time because I was teaching the British ones?  What were the British ones again?  Nignog.  Yeah, I forgot about Nignog. 
[03:46:00]  Nignog.  Having some holiday Nignog.  It sounds festive.  It does.  I forgot about Nignog.  Pour me some more Nignog.  That's the bad one.  That's the bad one?  And Paki's the real bad one.  You say the word Paki.  Paki?  See, the word Paki's a weird one because it's short for Pakistani.  Oh, right.  Okay.  It's just like saying Aussie.  In Australia, it's like saying Aussie.  The only problem is that the British put the word fucking in front of it.  You know what I mean?  As long as you take that word, it's all right.  But otherwise, it's just a bit offensive. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Hmm, look at that.  See, you did have more facts.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  But Nignog's funnier.  Nignog.  Autism awareness.  Hmm, which one of these kids is autistic?  Let's guess.  Well, you know how you have the ones doing Ring Around the Rosie?  Yeah.  You see the other one laying on top of the papers on the desk so they don't blow away?  Paperweight autism.  That's pretty autistic. 
[03:47:00]  That is horrid.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Opie.  Anthony.  Dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedy gone too far.  Comedy gone too far. </pre>
