<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion about Charlie Sheen's public meltdown.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton dissected Sheen's bizarre interviews, his "goddesses," his claims of being a "rock star from Mars," and his feud with CBS, comparing his behavior to that of Muammar Gaddafi. They speculated on Sheen's drug use and potential manic state, discussed the reactions of his family, and predicted the future of *Two and a Half Men*.  The hosts referenced a TMZ interview showing various people in Sheen's backyard, including someone Norton knew.  They also commented on Alex Jones' defense of Sheen on *The View*. The segment included personal anecdotes from the hosts, including Opieâ€™s home security cameras and Norton's past celebrity encounters, along with a comedic recap of a past Chubby Checker appearance and a bit about Wesley Snipes' prison sentence. The entire segment was filled with profanity and irreverent humor.

Next, the show transitioned to a discussion of Wesley Snipes' prison sentence, utilizing offensive prison-themed jokes. This segued into an in-studio interview with Topher Grace, promoting *Take Me Home Tonight*.  The conversation covered the film's production, the 80s, working with Anna Faris, and Grace's time on *That '70s Show*.  The hosts and Grace engaged in lighthearted banter, often veering off into tangents about other movies, I-95 traffic, and Charlie Sheen.  Grace did a Michael J. Fox impression, and the conversation included references to *Back to the Future* and other cast members like Dan Fogler, Chris Pratt, and Demetri Martin.  They also compared *Take Me Home Tonight* to *Reservoir Dogs*, with Grace even performing a song from the soundtrack.  The interview ended with further discussion of the film and a mention of a Michael Madsen premiere.  The segment maintained the show's informal, crude, and offensive tone.

Following the interview, a significant portion of the broadcast centered on a host's mispronunciation of "Nintendo Wii" as "Nintendo W2," sparking a lengthy debate about pronunciation and capitalization, fueled by listener calls and the hosts' playful arguments. They coined terms like "Bertation" and "Darrison" for on-air verbal blunders. This was followed by a discussion of one host's unpleasant experience with a male masseuse instead of the expected female masseuse, leading to vulgar descriptions and caller anecdotes about similar experiences.

The show then launched into a planned game, "Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior," where the hosts and guests (possibly including Roland, Travis, and Iraq) guessed the source of various quotes.  A song by Troy Kwan using Charlie Sheen soundbites was played and debated for its merits and potential as a new intro segment. The search for a guest, Roland, to complete the game continued.


The broadcast continued with Opie detailing his baby's fussy behavior, including a messy sneezing episode.  This led to a discussion about the difficulties of watching movies with a baby and the challenges of parenthood as birth control.  The "Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior" game resumed, proving difficult and resulting in many ties. The game involved numerous profane and crude statements from the hosts and guests (including Roland, potentially Travis and Iraq).

Finally, the show featured a segment with a comedian known as "The Virus," scheduled to deliver a single Charlie Sheen joke.  The Virus struggled, leading to improvisation and audience participation, with callers suggesting material and comedic names.  The Virus eventually delivered a joke.  The show concluded with discussion of upcoming segments, including the sexually explicit "Deadliest Snatch," soliciting calls from women with "smelly pussies," and a promotional announcement for Jim Norton's stand-up tour.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Yeah, good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  How's everyone this morning?  Very good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you get a good night's sleep?  I went to bed at 11.  I passed up Motorhead in concert to go to bed like a good boy. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, you did?  Very hard to do.  That's a sign of getting old.  I know.  Oh, God.  I didn't want to, though.  I wanted to go.  But they didn't go on until 10.30.  And I was like, you know what?  I got Hannity tonight.  I want to fucking...  Hannity tonight.  Yeah, but I don't want to be on, like, you know, no sleep again.  I didn't come in and fall asleep during the show.  You know, I can't do it.  You're right.  Hannity?  Like, the same Hannity I'm doing on the 17th?  Are you?  Yes.  You've been bumped.  No!  Yeah, I talked to them.  They bumped you.  No, they didn't.  Shut up.  Stop.  They find your views too conservative. 
[00:02:00]  I could join this discussion, too, because he's begging me to come back on.  I'm going to dip back into the stupid TV world.  You should jump in.  Jump in with both feet.  I just told him, look, I don't want to do fucking politics.  Can we pick a day when maybe there's some light and airy stuff?  Light and airy like Libya.  Yeah.  When are you going to talk about hockey?  Yeah.  I'll come on and show that I don't really know much about hockey.  I don't think he'd do much hockey.  No, I know.  Maybe a little. 
[00:02:30]  I'll jump in.  You'd just goof on Muammar Gaddafi.  First of all, I didn't know the guy spoke English.  Muammar?  Yeah.  He does?  Did you hear him on that interview?  Saying his people love him?  Yeah, I saw that.  That was great.  I'm trying to figure out who's crazier, Charlie Sheen or Gaddafi.  It's a close one.  Gaddafi is the Charlie Sheen of Libya.  That's what it is.  They should switch places for a week.  They're in denial.  Yeah.  Gaddafi could be doing the rounds on TV and Charlie Sheen could try to run that country.  I think nothing would change.  No. 
[00:03:00]  People wouldn't even notice.  No.  Gaddafi sitting in Charlie Sheen's backyard, porn stars around, and then Charlie Sheen  giving speeches on top of buildings, saying his people love him and throwing money  out on him.  Well, that was Charlie Sheen's backyard.  I thought it was your backyard.  Yeah, I was.  It looked very similar to your backyard.  It looked very similar to some of the stuff you do when you throw the Ustream on.  I was looking at that interview that he did for TMZ.  Yeah.  By the way, I got to say right off the bat, that guy that interviewed Charlie Sheen sucks. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  He's one of Harvey's guys.  Yeah.  I think he was trying to just do the hang thing with him.  Yeah, but why don't they get Harvey?  Harvey.  That guy sucks.  Harvey Harvey.  Harvey.  But they what?  Just set up a Ustream and said, let's go?  Let's have some fun?  Then they just went at it, started talking, babbling.  I think your backyard's nicer, by the way.  I think it's a little bigger and stuff, and a little nicer.  He does have that outside bar, and it looked like a cooking area or something. 
[00:04:00]  Like you're in the Bahamas?  Yeah, it was kind of nice.  Poolside?  Yeah, I got the bar in the house because it's sometimes the weather.  Well, what's wrong with you?  Let's get the bar going outside.  I got a nice big barbecue thing, though, which is built up, and I use it like a bar in the summer.  This is what I noticed.  Your pool's nicer.  The landscaping is nicer.  You got a jacuzzi.  Maybe he does somewhere in that area.  Yeah, yeah.  But you now need an outside bar.  Don't let Charlie Sheen have a better backyard than you.  I know. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  I was watching that, just looking around, and I was thinking the same thing.  Like, wow, that kind of has a familiar feel to it.  Right down to the hungover girls on the sidewalk.  I know.  Actually, uh...  Sorry.  Sorry to the girls that are listening, but...  Well, no, it's true.  It's been well documented.  Actually, because we were watching it yesterday, and Melissa actually said, she goes, do you  realize, and this is, she didn't even hear when we were talking about the fact that, you  know, I was making fun of Charlie Sheen and then realized, oh my God, wait a minute, he's 
[00:05:00]  kind of talking about the same shit I do.  She goes, do you realize you are Charlie Sheen without coke, but with guns?  So you're kind of crazier than he is?  I'm like, well, slow down.  I don't think I'm that nuts.  Yeah.  But, uh, but it's, yeah, there's all kinds of shenanigans and hijinks going on.  By the way, nobody thinks they're that nuts.  No, no.  Nobody thinks they're nuts.  Well, that's true.  No one thinks they're nuts.  Right.  That's true.  Do you think?  You answer a door, fucking dress like John Wayne, a fucking, a six shooter. 
[00:05:30]  You're, you're fucking crazy.  Well, you can't, you can't get to it at home if, if it's not on you.  You had a 50 cal on your kitchen table.  I was just, I had a little kid was checking out.  I saw that picture.  I had to look through the scope to see what the neighbors were doing.  Well, of course you have to.  Jesus.  If they only knew.  If they only knew.  I don't load it.  What story's true and what story's not.  You figure it out.  I have binoculars for that. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Actually the neighbor, one of the neighbors, uh, knocked on my door yesterday.  And this hasn't happened in, uh, like years.  What happened?  Years.  And then I got a little like, what's going on?  Uh-oh.  Cause he goes, he goes, uh.  Did you think it was the FBI?  No, no, no.  I knew it was the next door neighbor.  Okay.  But I hadn't seen him in a while.  And he goes, uh, do, um, any of your cameras point at my house?  Oh, shit.  So I'm like, I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:06:30]  But, but I told him, I go, because they don't, I go, no, no.  I got, I got a couple that, that move around.  But, uh, the ones on his side of the house are pretty stationary, taking care of the whole  side of my house that goes, you know, next to his house.  And, uh, cause that's what I thought he was gonna, like, like, you know, I thought he  was gonna say something like, my wife doesn't like the idea that the camera's on.  Uh, but then he said, uh, he goes, yeah, uh, last night somebody took the emblem off  of my Mercedes and, uh, Range Rover and stuff. 
[00:07:00]  And just, like, ripped it off of the hood of his car.  And he goes, he was wondering if I had any video of it.  And he was like, no, I, I don't have anything pointed that out.  And I was like, in this neighborhood?  He goes, he goes, I know nothing ever happens here.  Uh, and, uh, and that, you know, that is considered a, a home invasion in, uh, in my neighborhood.  So.  Getting excited.  Uh, you know, crime getting a little closer to the house.  Getting a little closer.  A little closer to the house.  How excited are you?  Ah, pretty excited.  It's that thing you're getting a little itchy.  Eh, a little itch.  Oh, it's not getting itchy. 
[00:07:30]  Uh, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, he was wondering that and I, I couldn't help.  I, uh, I, like, I, and it's, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you.  And the truth, it doesn't face anyone's house.  It's all on my property and shit.  All right.  Well, uh, can we, can we get Brie Olsen on the phone?  No one has talked to her yet.  And she's one of the girls being held captive by, uh, Mr. Sheen there.  Yeah.  How the hell is that?  Kind of a friend of the show.  Friend of Jimmy's, certainly.  I don't know if she, I'll, I'll text you.  I don't know if she'll recognize my new number. 
[00:08:00]  She was, uh, she was one of the girls on the, on the, um, sidewalk or whatever.  I'm calling it a sidewalk, but, uh, out there in the backyard with Charlie Sheen.  In the yard, just, uh, there.  She was the one giving the peace, uh, the peace sign with the,  sunglasses on.  Peace.  We know Brie a little bit.  Wait, wait, in a picture or?  No, she was part of the TMZ interview.  TMZ.  She's one of the goddesses, Jimmy.  You didn't know that?  He's got goddesses.  And one of them is, uh, someone Jimmy knows.  He flies on unicorns.  Back in the day.  To the center of the sun or something.  Well, yeah, let me get the exact quote.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Cause know who should get credit is, uh, Jay Moore summed up the Charlie Sheen thing perfectly.  Jay Moore's?  Jay Moore's, uh.  Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore 37 tweeted this yesterday.  I respect any man that turns tin cans into gold, has goddesses, cures diseases with his  mind, and rides unicorns into the center of the sun.  That's Charlie Sheen.  See, cause you, you try to figure out what to do with this Charlie Sheen thing.  Yeah.  Jay just did it in one tweet.  And I noticed the end of every Jay tweet, uh, last night was, uh, like, I win. 
[00:09:00]  Winner.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Fucking Charlie Sheen.  Winning.  He got coffee yesterday, I think, from, uh, I don't know, one of the goddesses, and he  goes, winning.  It's my favorite part.  It's like, winning.  Right.  Like, like, like, fuck you.  Look at me.  Winning.  Winning.  What an asshole.  He is an asshole, and he, but he's, I can't get enough of, of his, his, his attitude. 
[00:09:30]  And they got shrinks on shows, diagnosing him from just his videos.  Right.  It's like, uh.  Someone in the paper said he's absolutely crazy and needs to be institutionalized.  He does have a weird, wacky look to him.  But then this person goes, uh, but I've never, you know, met him or anything like that.  And, no, I, I told you this morning, I, I can't get enough of this because you rarely  see a celebrity without his people protecting him.  This guy is out there pretty much by himself now, just saying shit. 
[00:10:00]  And usually, you know, you got your people that'll pull you back and go, dude, come on,  you can't do this.  Stan Rosenfeld quit.  Yeah.  And, and, and the one main guy quit yesterday.  So he is completely out there by himself.  And that's why this is so fascinating.  And his family.  No filters whatsoever going on with Charlie Sheen right now.  Martin Sheen apparently was saying, uh, you know, Hey, this is, this is the disease.  This is what you're seeing is a man with a disease.  And, uh, you know, there's nothing we, we, we're trying, but, uh, like he won't even 
[00:10:30]  talk to him until all the media that, that keeps saying supposedly he passed a drug test  and all, I have no doubt.  Charlie Sheen is, is clean right now, right now.  But the thing is that at any moment he's going to do a shitload of cocaine.  Yeah.  Do you know what he reminds me of?  Do you ever not sleep for three days?  He reminds me of how you are.  Like, I believe that he's not doing coke at the moment.  He might be just saying, I can't right now.  Right.  But he reminds me of a guy that hasn't slept in a few days and is just talking loopy. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Oh yeah.  He's manic.  And, uh, he, he brings that up too.  Everyone's saying I'm manic.  No, you are.  He just sounds a little loopy.  It's like when Jimmy comes in after the red eye fight.  That's how it feels.  It's like you're watching a guy, it's like, he's going, everybody's thinking, I don't think  he's crazy.  It's like hard to, to argue with a guy who just, I don't want to do drugs, but it's  hard to argue with a guy who just wants to get high and fuck porn chicks.  That's a tough argument to make.  It really is.  And, and that's his argument is so right.  That's his whole argument is, Hey, I'm doing what I do. 
[00:11:30]  And then people bring up the fact that, you know, are you, aren't you afraid of, uh, uh,  dying?  A lot of these, uh, stars that live this kind of lifestyle end up dead.  And he's like, it's not the same for every person.  I can handle it.  No, and he didn't say that.  Oh, what did he say?  He said, read the warning labels, read the warning labels.  Scoreboard doesn't lie.  That's right.  Why?  Scoreboard doesn't lie.  Did he say that?  That's another one he's been saying.  That's another one of his.  Why aren't you talking in Charlie Sheen?  I'm trying.  I'm really trying.  He said, read the warning labels.  I'm an F-18, bro. 
[00:12:00]  You got to read the warning labels.  That's why he's not going to OD.  Read the warning labels.  He doesn't mix shit.  He knows, he knows exactly what he's doing because he reads the warning labels.  Dude, he reminds me of a, he says things that David Brent would say if he was doing drugs.  Yeah, he really does.  Have we ever seen Charlie Sheen though, like before this in any kind of interview?  Not like this.  Like, like, do we know how, was he, was he kind of a little crazy in, in interviews? 
[00:12:30]  Remember years ago he said 50,000 on prostitutes and that, and that became like, holy shit.  Right.  He, years ago, Charlie Sheen was a little fucking nutty and more open than most of these guys  are.  Well, yeah.  Nothing like this.  Right.  He was, he was on Piers Morgan yesterday.  What I'm noticing as the days go by, he looks healthier.  Yeah.  He really does.  Maybe he's sleeping a little bit.  Right now he knows everyone's watching him, so he's really trying to stay clean for now.  But like I said earlier, any second he's going to just do a shitload of something.  He cured himself.  What are you, crazy?  Oh, that's right. 
[00:13:00]  Where are you?  You're right.  Scoreboard doesn't lie.  Scoreboard doesn't lie.  He blinked his eyes.  Right.  And, uh, he's, uh, he's cured.  But what he said last night, he goes, look at me, I'm in great shape.  I'm down to my high school weight.  And I'm thinking, that's not because you're dieting and exercising.  It's no sleeping.  Like, having done blow.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  He's a warlock.  My favorite line from the, um, uh, the Piers Morgan interview, I tweeted, I gotta just find  it really fast.  Uh, it was a classic. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, I think we even have it.  Uh, Piers Morgan goes, you were taking a lot of cocaine.  Charlie Sheehan.  Well, I wasn't just taking it.  I had to pay for it.  Yeah.  You had to pay for it.  So, uh, what do you want to do?  We got it.  We got a little loving him.  We got a few just, uh, selective clips.  Any of it.  I would love to hear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we got the great, uh, song by Troy Kwan.  That was great yesterday.  That really brings it home.  Nice.  We all liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Nice.  Do you think Charlie will come? 
[00:14:00]  Like, I'm kind of hoping, cause everyone I know who knows him says he's a fucking great  guy.  Like every, not one person I know is bad mouthed, even in private.  Yeah.  Do you think like he'll look back on this and go, yeah, well, you know, I was kind of,  I was coming off things and I was a little nutty.  I'm hoping he looks back on this like a year and goes like, yeah, just being an ass.  I don't, I don't know how this ends with everybody leaving him.  It's, it makes it tougher to, uh, to get his shit together.  Oh, he was so good in platoon.  Certainly was.  And that two and a half men, I, I, I saw it a couple of times.  It's better than I thought it would be though. 
[00:14:30]  It's not, uh, it's a little edgy.  Yeah.  Edgier than you would expect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that show is not going away.  That poor John Cryer.  No.  What, why isn't he doing interviews and just being like, do you understand what I had to  do to get on a hit show?  I was dead in the water for 20 years.  No, I don't think he's at that point.  Cause I think this show comes back next year.  It's a huge, there's too, there's too much of a buzz and I, I don't know if the ratings 
[00:15:00]  will stay, but certainly the first few episodes, everyone's going to check out to see what they  did with the show.  I noticed, I, and I don't even know if this was going on, but I'm noticing now more so  than I, I did.  Uh, they're playing, uh, two and a half men on like all the time.  Now, if I run through the channel guide, it's, it's on every one of those, you know,  kind of TBS.  It's all over the place.  You don't go, it's like Seinfeld used to be.  It's just on every channel three times in a row. 
[00:15:30]  But Seinfeld's not on as much?  Not as much as it used to be.  Fading out a little bit?  Yeah, yeah.  They've backed off on it on a lot of channels.  It's still there.  It's like MASH, kind of not, not quite every time.  I guess because everybody's seen every one of them.  Yeah, yeah.  They're figuring.  Yeah, they slow down a little bit.  Does anyone know how much Seinfeld makes a week for just being in syndication?  No idea.  Has that number ever been?  I'm sure it's out.  I mean, because his number was legendary when he got syndicated.  Like, this guy doesn't work and he's getting, who knows, a week from that syndication of  that show. 
[00:16:00]  And he's out doing stand-up and fucking doing like 3,000 or 1,800 seats.  Just what a fucking dream life he has, man.  Just enjoying his life.  Yeah.  All right, we got some Charlie Sheen.  So you got the, oh, okay.  Oh, oh, good.  We got this.  Alex Jones went on The View yesterday.  Alex Jones is nutcase, too.  He's his mouthpiece.  I don't think, I don't think, even Charlie Sheen's probably like, oh, God.  And of course he's talking.  I'll talk to you, but geez, don't try to defend me.  Of course he's talking conspiracies.  Oh, why would he?  His whole life is a one big conspiracy. 
[00:16:30]  A quonspiracy.  Unbelievable.  What's conspiracy?  Alex, why don't you just say the guy's falling apart?  He's having a rough time.  This is what he said on The View yesterday.  Do you think there's something underlying here that people are missing as a friend?  I just think that he's somebody going through a hard time who got clean and that's why went  out to California to help him.  And I know that it's wrong for them to be prodding him, yes, and demonizing him and trying  to make him blow up.  That's actually what I believe is going on here.  They should all just shake hands, bury the hatchet, come together for the crew of two and 
[00:17:00]  a half men, and try to support Charlie, but also Chuck Lorre, everybody else, but understand  what happened.  So you're worried about him?  But Charlie's tired of being held up like the devil.  We've got the TSA putting their hand down people's pants.  Infowars.com covers it all.  We've got the banks bankrupt.  Oh, he made it about himself.  Oh, Alex.  He had to throw in the website.  The TSA, stop with the TSA.  When they're hands down everyone's pants.  What do you want?  We've got the banks bankrupting the U.S. 
[00:17:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We're sticking with, let's stick with Charlie.  That's way too much.  Charlie is mad because he's held up his own problems.  He didn't steal $23.7 trillion.  We're just here to figure out what is happening with Charlie.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  And he has, he's doing interviews now, so he has a chance to speak for himself.  But they're taking out of context.  We're not comparing him to Gaddafi.  Oh, they've been comparing him to Gaddafi.  Look, I'm just saying, I don't think I've ever heard anybody.  Let's compare George Bush, a million dollar Iraqis. 
[00:18:00]  Torture, secret, arrest, America turning into a police state.  I think we were here to talk about Charlie.  Demand an apology, Senator.  Charlie says you have a right to kill him, but not to judge him.  Thank you.  You are so very wonderful, sir.  Jeez, Alex.  It's like, Alex, what do you, it's like.  Well, he knows he's not going to have a shot like that ever again.  Why would he ever be on The View?  He just was, he looked down and had the first interview with Charlie Sheen. 
[00:18:30]  So now it's make it about yourself and get your shit out there.  Right?  That, that is using, that's like, that's using your friend.  I mean, anyone would take the, we would all go on The View.  Yeah.  But when you throw it out, info, what are you doing, Alex?  Yeah, he's throwing out his website.  Stop shoehorning it into your, it's how it's.  Infowars.com.  His thing does seem very self-serving and very radio of, of people.  Like, like, this is the type of thing that if you're in radio, you, you, you die for shit like this. 
[00:19:00]  It's like, oh my God, I have the exclusive story, or at least he did.  He was like one of the first guys with all these wacky interviews.  And you just kind of keep going.  You just want it to keep going.  And now that he's doing all these interviews on television.  All these interviews, we're going to have them booked by Thursday.  Yeah, right?  I'm like, how come we can't get it?  They're moving down the list quickly.  I think we're going to make it.  I think we're going to have one.  We'll be the last one on the list.  Of course.  Oh, that would be great. 
[00:19:30]  Put on some feelers.  You know what I think Charlie's stupid?  I tweeted that I think he's making an ass out of himself.  But not because he's getting laid and blowing loads.  But I think what he shouldn't be doing is blatantly attacking CBS because he was forcing their hand by doing that.  And there's so much money at stake.  There's a way to handle that without just going, Chuck Lorre.  He's basically saying that the guy's made nothing but shit and I've made it better.  You can't, in front of everybody, force the network's hand like that.  And CBS doesn't lose unless they talk. 
[00:20:00]  And they're not going to talk.  No, unless they say we wish them well.  Yeah.  Well, they're not going to talk.  And they're not going to lose the money.  This show will come back next year.  You know, and they'll do okay.  I don't know if it'll be up to where it is today.  They'll milk it for one more year.  Look at American Idol.  They'll easily get a year out of it.  Easily.  Maybe two.  But that show was on its last leg anyway.  We're wondering how many more years it had.  Really?  Who do you think replaces them?  Charlie's done eight.  The kid.  The kid?  The kid, really. 
[00:20:30]  And bring in a new kid.  I don't even know anyone else on that show.  I know John Cryer.  Do you think, though, imagine if this mess clears up and he's okay and he makes up with  that.  Because right now, he's still done nothing that's not forgivable.  Uh-huh.  All he's done is just shoot his mouth off.  And if the show came back next year, it would be a fucking massive hit again.  Who's not watching the first episode?  The news would be teasing it.  Like, oh, Charlie Sheen's returned to television.  And you'd be like, oh, okay. 
[00:21:00]  And it would just be a show.  He'd be active.  He really does seem like a guy that can pull it off.  Like, when you see him on that show, he's not rambling like a crazy man.  He's doing his lines.  He's, you know, hitting his marks.  True.  But he was starting to look very weathered.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  The change in the guy on the show.  And that's with makeup and the proper lighting.  And you just.  Oh, my God.  He was looking horrendous.  He was just attributing it to the fact that he's getting a little older. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, really?  In a week.  Yeah.  A week's time.  It's like time-lapse photography on Charlie.  Yes.  I got a text from somebody who I don't want to say his name, Roland.  And he says, John Stamos is rumored to be replacing Charlie Sheen.  I don't know if that's true or not.  Yeah, we heard that in one of the tirades he was going off on last night and said he kind  of bad-mouthed him.  Well.  Oh, Charlie Sheen said that?  Roland is just quoting Charlie Sheen?  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen was like, yeah, they were talking about bringing John Stamos on. 
[00:22:00]  He goes, yeah, roll with that turd.  He's like, turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Did he really say turd?  Turd.  He said turd last night?  I don't know.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Taking track of all the Sheen-isms.  Who would want to step into that position?  Man, that's a tough one.  I mean, the money's going to be really good for whoever does the Charlie Sheen role, if  that's the direction they take.  Yeah.  What was that show that fucking, oh, God, John Ritter was on? 
[00:22:30]  Three's Company.  No.  I actually answered no seriously.  Something about eight.  No.  Rules for Dating My Daughter.  Eight Rules for Dating My Daughter.  Yeah.  And then didn't they recast him?  See, no one knows.  Uh-oh.  I think they recast him.  And then News Radio, right?  After Hartman.  Didn't they recast Phil Hartman?  It's hard, though.  When a guy gets shot or a heart attack, it's like, now you're like, what do we do immediately? 
[00:23:00]  But Charlie Sheen fucking...  You're kind of watching him go down the slide slowly.  Yes.  Charlie's fiddling while Rome burns.  Well, they should have me on the view.  I'll say important things.  We got Charlie tells Piers Morgan.  Yeah, the Piers Morgan interview was the best one so far, because...  Yeah.  I told Ant before the show, I think Piers basically sat Charlie down and said, enough with the  neuralisms and all that weird shit.  Let's have an interview.  Because at one point, Charlie said something, and he stopped himself. 
[00:23:30]  Like, oh, yeah.  Like, that's right.  We talked about this.  I'm not supposed to be doing that.  I was suspicious, because he was trying not to go with the unicorns and the goddesses  and the winning as much.  F-18, bro.  Although he couldn't help himself a few times, but...  Yeah, yeah.  He backed off a little bit.  And I think that was some advice that Piers gave him before, I think.  Let's do a real interview, mate.  People are laughing at you.  It seemed like.  Yeah, yeah.  It seemed like.  That's probably what he would say.  Charlie tells Piers Morgan he didn't take...  Oh, this is the quote I just read, but whatever. 
[00:24:00]  Here's how it went down on CNN last night.  Or maybe not.  Or maybe.  You take cocaine, right?  Well, I used to.  I gotta be careful, because there's lawsuits and things going on and whatever.  No, until you stopped, you were taking a lot of cocaine.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'm not taking it.  I had to pay for it, dude.  I mean, come on.  So...  I'm taking it.  I had to pay for it.  His voice seems really weathered, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's got a lot of rasp to it now.  But he said he's got the lungs of a guy that doesn't smoke, according to the doctors. 
[00:24:30]  His throat is a little fucked up.  Yeah.  You know?  I think it's from talking so much, too.  And I don't know what to believe, because last night he was name-dropping.  He said, ah, Sean Penn stopped by, and Mel Gibson called me, and I saw him.  Oh, God.  And then he goes...  You're doing your fucking cunt?  Yeah.  And I saw Sylvester Stallone in the gym.  Really?  And he wants to do a movie.  But you know it was one of those things, like, hey, let's do a movie together.  But Charlie's mind's like, oh, I'm going to do a movie now with Sylvester Stallone.  Him and Sean Penn are very close, though.  I've heard it was him and Sean...  Chris Penn and Emilio Estevez were supposedly very close, and then Charlie and Sean Penn 
[00:25:00]  were supposedly really good friends.  They had some weird bond.  That's what I've heard.  Well, Michael Madsen yesterday was talking about the fact that Charlie Sheen was at Chris  Penn's funeral.  So, yeah, and I was wondering where that came in.  I was like, I don't remember them doing movies together, didn't they?  I don't know.  No, but they were actually all four of those guys were really good friends.  Yeah.  Hmm.  They replaced John Ritter with David Spade. 
[00:25:30]  Is that true?  Tim in Jersey saying that.  Oh, God.  Because you asked, Dan.  So let's go to Tim.  Wait, didn't they...  I thought they did that with, like, news radio.  Tim?  No, it's Ken.  All right.  Yeah.  No, they actually replaced him with James Gardner and David Spade.  Like, I guess James Gardner played a grandfather and David Spade played a nephew.  Ooh.  Wow, I don't remember that at all.  Well, that's really changing the formula of a show.  Yeah, it sure is.  Yeah, I guess it worked well.  Yeah, that's why I canceled pretty quick after that. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What show?  Eight Rules?  The John Ritter show, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's what he's saying.  I don't know.  Is that true?  Well, I mean, he wasn't replaced.  I mean, they went...  The show was never really a hit in the first place.  No, no, it wasn't.  And after he died, I mean, they just had nothing.  Yeah, someone said it never cracked the top ten.  No, nowhere close.  Jenny's pointing out that he called him James Gardner.  He's the Gardner.  That is funny. 
[00:26:30]  Charlie talks to TMZ.  Yeah, this was great yesterday.  Talks to TMZ about his dad from his backyard.  It's on TMZ.com if you want to check out the whole thing.  I mean, they're making coffee, and then they're talking to some black guy, and then there's  an Asian guy in the backyard.  Then you've got the goddesses.  The black guy had a Louisville slugger in his hand, too, or something.  And his name's Willie Mays Hayes or something?  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  It's some piece.  Willie Mays Hayes is the character from Major League. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, okay.  That's the Wesley Snipes character.  I'm sorry.  It's Willie Mays Hayes.  I'm sorry.  Wesley Snipes?  I didn't like you, Danny.  Will you get the blade haircut or the demolition man?  I was watching that animation recently.  It's probably one of the funniest ones ever done.  Yeah.  With Patrice.  Absolutely.  We were in here all talking about the fact that Wesley Snipes has gone to prison for tax  evasion and what it would be like for Wesley to be in prison and all the dumb questions  he would get.  If you get a chance, fucking watch that again, because Patrice is so fucking funny in that. 
[00:27:30]  Man, what if the blade cut costs more?  Well, dude, the hair dye for the demolition man is more cigarettes.  The audio works.  We should play it into break.  How long is that?  It's funny, man.  I don't think it's that long.  It might be three or four minutes.  It's definitely worth playing.  I saw that recently, too.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's so fucking funny, man.  Is he in jail now, Wesley?  Or did he actually go? 
[00:28:00]  I think he finally got him in jail.  I think he's in jail.  He's in jail, I believe.  Yeah.  Here's Charlie talking to TMZ about his dad.  What do you have to say to your dad?  I'm just, you know, I mean, he was there at the hospital, but go ahead.  Sure.  I mean, I respect that.  I respectfully allow him to maintain those beliefs and those opinions.  And I don't support them.  As I said, I think it's the gibberish of fools.  And he doesn't live inside my brain.  I'm the only one that does.  And he's my dad and like that. 
[00:28:30]  And he's Captain Miller.  And that's pretty bitching.  I've got to listen to a little bit about what he, you know, dude killed Brando.  Come on.  So, yeah, no, no, no disrespect.  But I'm 45 years old at some point.  Accept and embrace that, you know, with five kids.  He's five kids?  Yeah.  Five kids.  Supposedly he's got a daughter that's grown and then some small children.  He fucking really digs Apocalypse Now.  He really loves that movie.  He acts around Apocalypse Now like I would if my dad did it. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, because when he's mentioned it, he's just, he loves it.  He's picked it apart.  He's like, watched it a few times in his theater.  When you, when you, uh, when you watch Platoon, your first thought is he's narrating that and  Martin narrated Apocalypse.  Yeah, yeah.  Martin narrated Apocalypse better.  And Charlie would probably tell you that.  But he's like, wow, he really did love the fact that his father was Captain Willard.  That's great.  Yeah.  You have to though.  Yeah.  Do you think he narrated it better?  It was such a different type of, it was like Martin Sheen's character was just the 
[00:29:30]  guy that had been through the shit and seen everything over and over again.  And Charlie Sheen's character was like the new fish who's in there.  So it was more of an innocence to Martin Sheen, uh, Charlie Sheen's narration.  I, yeah, it was a little more gruff with, I still think Martin was better.  I think Martin's narration is one of the best ever.  Maybe Clockwork was as good or close to it.  That was really good.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  You know, it's funny.  I watched recently Apocalypse Now with my girlfriend.  She hadn't seen it, but we got the director's cut and it's one of the rare where the director's 
[00:30:00]  cut is terrible.  It's like, I can't say terrible.  There's a couple of additions that are horrendous.  There's no reason for it to be in there.  Are you talking about the, the redux version?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just did that to show you what he had shot.  But what, what was added?  There's a couple of scenes.  It's like, you realize the genius of editors.  Uh, it made me mad.  There's a scene where he encounters French soldiers.  The French.  Yeah.  And I, it was a statement about Vietnam.  Again, it was 79.  So I'm sure he would tell you it was terrible.  It was like a half hour scene.  There's another scene where you remember the playboy bunny for the, they're all sure where 
[00:30:30]  they're on the river and they actually stop at this muddy campground to, to get, uh, a  fuel or whatever.  And they see that the playboy bunnies are there and they show scenes that the guys on the boat  fucking the playboy bunnies.  There's a lot of stuff that wasn't in the movie.  And when you realize, and remember the surf, uh, Robert Duvall's character is in the movie  a little longer this time.  Yeah.  Trying to get a surfboard back cause they took it.  But the edited version is the best version.  Like the director's cut is not the version.  Yeah.  It's like, there's no doubt. 
[00:31:00]  It goes on much too long, much too long.  Cause the movie even edited was long movie, but it was, it was, it was good.  But, uh, when you see what they cut out, you realize, oh, that's what an editor does.  There was one scene that I kind of thought was kind of cool.  And that was when Mark, when Brando as Colonel Kurtz was sitting there in the daylight with  a bunch of kids around him, huh?  Reading the page, reading articles from time magazine to captain Willer.  That was weird to see Brando in daylight in that movie.  And he seemed smart there and aware of what was going on in the world. 
[00:31:30]  He wasn't crazy.  So they cut that fucker out.  So he just looked like a nut the whole time.  Yeah.  But the edited version read, read ducks or whatever it was.  I mean, he did it just cause people wanted to see it, but man, make sure you,  watch the edited version.  It's better.  Charlie looking more and more like Marlon Brando's character in Apocalypse Now.  He really is starting to sound like that fucking kook.  A little bit.  He's very Kurtz-ish in what he talks about.  Yeah, no kidding.  Wow.  That's like an extra 49 minutes of additional footage.  It seemed like longer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That French thing was just like, all right. 
[00:32:00]  I was so angry cause she hadn't seen it.  I'm like, this is not the movie.  No.  And it just went on and on.  Why wouldn't you just go to the regular version?  I didn't realize I had it.  I didn't know where it was.  That was just the version I had in front of me.  I was looking for the regular version.  All right.  Just fast forward.  Yeah, look.  Don't watch this part.  Okay.  Here we go.  Just watch the original.  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing.  That's the shit.  I'm not a big fan of the extras.  Gotta tell you.  If you liked them on a DVD though, like if you can just go and see them.  If you have a copy of the DVD that you see the film straight through, then you can just 
[00:32:30]  go look at the...  That's kind of cool, but...  I like the director's cut of Aliens.  The second Alien movie.  Aliens.  I'm out of this conversation.  I don't know that one either.  The first one too is good.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Those I didn't mind.  Them throwing in the extras.  I mean, it's not fair though because these guys are trying all sorts of stuff on set.  And then when they have a chance to put it all on a DVD, you know, for the true fans,  they want to throw it in there.  Yeah.  But I'm sure they knew it just wasn't great at all.  Well, the editors supposedly, like I heard Tarantino, and editors is like really a co-director. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  And they're the ones who can tell the director, that's not good.  You can't have that.  Right.  Because directors are married to it.  They said editors a lot of times won't go on set.  They won't meet the actors until after.  They want to see it just as the audience sees it.  Right.  And then they can tell you what that's not helping the story.  And they make some fucking tough decisions.  Yeah, because it's very hard for a director to look at something and go like, oh, yeah,  I remember that day.  This was a fucking, you know, an all-day shoot to get this, and you're cutting it out. 
[00:33:30]  They don't care.  The editors don't give a fuck.  It's like, no, don't care.  It doesn't work for the movie.  Meanwhile, the director's like, he just wants it in there because it might have taken so  long that day, you know?  But it doesn't help the story at all.  Tarantino, the woman who died that Madsen referenced, she was supposedly, I mean, when you  You're kidding.  She was so good, Tarantino's editor.  And they would have screaming matches.  I mean, that's what I've heard is that they would, because it was like he wanted to keep  stuff and she was like, it's got to go.  By the way, how cool was fucking Madsen on the show talking about like the scene with 
[00:34:00]  the ear and how he's looking at it?  And you could see, like, because he goes, yeah, he goes, when I watch it, I could see  that I'm thinking, what do I do with this ear?  And Quentin's just yelling, throw it, throw it.  And then he thinks of talking into it.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  And when you watch it now, you can definitely see his mind's going.  That was cool to like get a little, we were watching one of the most famous scenes from  the movie.  And he broke it down.  And getting a fucking commentary.  It was great.  It was a great moment. 
[00:34:30]  It really was.  That was one of those things like, for me personally, I'll never forget that.  Yeah, yeah.  You're watching Reservoir Dogs with the guy and he's telling you, and you're sitting right  next to him, like that and like, and Chubby Checker playing live with Sabra Kadabra.  Sabra Kadabra.  Sabra Kadabra.  That for all time will remain one of the most surreal moments I've ever seen in my entire  life.  I forgot about that one, yeah.  I made that moment happen.  You guys don't remember, but.  I remember you do, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  It was Jimmy's birthday and his people were trying to strong arm us. 
[00:35:00]  They're like, look, he'll play that fucking song, but it's going to cost you 10,  $20,000.  Like, what?  And then I'm holding in my hand the latest Chubby Checker song that they just assumed  we were going to play.  He goes, but you can play the new song.  I'm like, that ain't happening.  Oh, can we?  The next thing you know, he's twisting his ass off.  Come on, baby!  There he is doing a twist.  I do got to give myself props on that one.  And he was doing the twist.  He did it all because he wanted that new song on the radio.  He was dancing.  Yep.  It was Jimmy's birthday. 
[00:35:30]  How great was that watching him instruct Sabra Kadabra?  And these guys, as musicians, to play with fucking a legend like that.  They figured it out right on the spot, too.  Yeah.  I was very impressed at you.  Those Sabra Kadabra guys, like, they're good.  They're good musicians.  Yes.  But what is even better is that they actually look and dress the part.  Yeah.  And they kind of act the part, too, because they're always just drunk.  Yeah.  And they just have long hair and they look like assholes.  So just have Chubby Checker doing the twist with them.  With them was really weird.  You're being called out, though, because some people are saying, if you remember, Jill Nicolini 
[00:36:00]  made that happen.  No, she brought him in.  No, she brought him in.  I know.  Oh, to start.  Yeah, yeah.  She brought him in.  She absolutely gets credit, too.  No, all I'm saying is that we didn't care.  We wanted him to do the twist.  I know.  You got the guy.  And we're not going to have to do the twist?  The people say, look, that's his big song, and he only does it for, like, $10,000.  I forgot the...  $10,000.  You're right.  Was it $10,000?  And we don't have $10,000 laying around.  No.  Then the guy is like, but the new song, which obviously no one has cared about since that  day.  So I used that against him. 
[00:36:30]  I said, well, okay, we can make a little deal right here for Jimmy's birthday.  You want the song to play?  I remember that.  And it was, you were right.  You were right.  But we wouldn't have had Chubby Checker if Jill didn't push the front.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  Getting back to the Charlie gate.  Charlie talks to TMZ about what his kids will think about all this.  Right.  How are the kids, by the way?  I mean, what about the fact that your kids one day will probably read about it?  I hope they do.  And what...  You hope they do?  Mm-hmm.  And what do you want to come from that when they read it? 
[00:37:00]  They want to...  I hope they say, Dad, fill in the blanks.  This shit's gnarly.  Fill in the blanks.  This stuff's epic.  You don't think it's a bad exhibit set for your children?  No.  I think it's the Pandora's box thing.  Like, don't eat candy.  And the first birthday party, they're having a frickin' brain tumor because they ate, you know,  7,000 red vines because they never tasted it before.  They went, oh, my God, this has been on the planet all this time.  And, no, man, don't hide your children and stuff, you know.  What's he talking about?  Like, he says things and you're like, I can't even pick this apart. 
[00:37:30]  It's actually a good parenting point, but it has nothing to do with, like, what his kids  are going to read about him in the future.  Oh, oh, right.  You can't, like, hold all this stuff back from your kids because as soon as they do leave  your house, they're going to go nuts.  Yeah.  He says, though, he goes, yeah, I parent.  Right.  Because the kids are right in the house.  They're right upstairs.  The clip, that was pretty interesting.  He said, no way would I want my kids doing cocaine.  He says, beer and all that.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:38:00]  It's out there.  I don't care if they, you know, have some beers and stuff.  But he certainly wants to, you know, keep them away from the cocaine.  So.  He, I forgot what I was going to say, but yeah.  You listen, you know how people justify things in their head?  Like, we justify what we do.  It's like, you never hear a guy verbalize what goes on.  And that's all you're hearing is a person justify everything.  It's kind of cool to hear.  Oh, yeah, it is.  That's what people think.  Yeah.  Even though most people don't say it publicly, that's how people think.  Yeah.  I don't even know how I feel about this whole thing. 
[00:38:30]  I just love it.  I just love watching.  I can't wait to see where he's going to pop up next.  I love it.  It's one of these news things that come about every so often.  And this is how it kind of used to be before all the publicists got involved and lawyers  and all that.  You had these celebrities.  People coming apart.  Well, you had the celebrities really speaking their minds with no filters.  Yeah, that's true.  There's no filter going on there.  I hope the people do understand.  They're smart enough.  This is rare.  Yeah.  That you get to see something like this.  It's fun. 
[00:39:00]  Even with the Lindsay Lohan, you don't really, you know, you see her in the courtroom, but  you don't see her actually unraveling or actually unraveling.  Doing interviews.  On live TV.  Every time you see her, she's got her mouth shut in court.  She's either saying not guilty or fucking keeping her mouth shut.  No lawyers talking for her.  Now, I think this is a question for Jimmy.  I'm not really sure, but I believe he's sober right now.  I really do.  Maybe, yeah.  And I'll say it again, any second he could be doing some drugs or alcohol.  Right. 
[00:39:30]  But if he stays sober, will he have some major withdrawals and stuff?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm guessing, but usually that's the first X amount of days or weeks.  It's not usually...  How many days usually?  Hard to say with the individual.  I think volume and alcohol, I think, are the worst.  Cocaine is bad.  Heroin is bad.  But I think alcohol and diamond are the two worst.  I don't know.  I mean, I hope that he just starts...  He's not the hardest case.  There's people in a lot worse...  If guys on the street can fucking stop who literally shit their pants, this guy with 
[00:40:00]  five kids and a lot of good people in his life, eventually he'll fucking hopefully stop.  But he's going to have some kind of breakdown, right?  Somewhere in the near future.  He could just fizzle out.  Like, literally, it could just...  All of a sudden, the interviews go away a little bit.  And he just kind of like, eh.  And he begins to slowly...  You know what I mean?  This whole thing could be all of a sudden, oh, yeah, that was six months ago.  Yeah, he could just be like, eh, well.  And then start doing what he's supposed to do.  I'm done with this.  I hope he does, because I like the guy.  I don't want to see him fucking have a heart attack.  If it was just pussy, I would say, do it all day. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Do it all fucking day and be belligerent.  But it's like, you're going to die.  It's like, come on, dude.  No one can smoke that much coke or get high that much and fucking...  That's fine.  Yeah, it's hard to do.  Yep.  One more clip for now.  Charlie tells the Today Show he wants a raise because he's a rock star from Mars.  You're angry.  Well, I'm not angry.  I'm passionate.  And then it's like, everybody thinks I should be, like, begging for my job back.  And I'm just going to forewarn them that it's everybody else that's going to be begging me for their job back. 
[00:41:00]  I'm a man of my word.  So I won't finish the TV show.  I'll even do season 10.  But it's at this point, because of psychological distress, oh, my God.  It's three mil an episode.  Take it or leave it.  Oh, so you want a raise?  Well, yeah.  Look what they put me through.  Well, yeah.  You make two million an episode now.  Roughly.  That includes the back end, yeah.  And you want three million now?  Well, because I'm underpaid right now, sure.  You're underpaid?  If you look at the money they're making, yeah, it's ridiculous.  I'm tired of pretending like I'm not special. 
[00:41:30]  I'm tired of pretending like I'm not bitching a total frickin' rock star from Mars.  And people can't figure me out.  They can't process me.  I don't expect them to.  You can't process me with a normal brain.  You can't process me with a normal brain.  That's where he just sounds like an ass.  I know.  But I love it.  You can't get enough of that.  How can we not get an interview with Charlie Sheen?  We probably could.  I think we're always working on it.  Probably.  Oh, is that Brie with him right there?  Yeah.  Brie and his girlfriend?  Yeah.  She's one of the goddesses. 
[00:42:00]  We have a connection to one of the goddesses.  Or Jimmy does.  She'd definitely try to get her on the fucking way.  I text her, but I'm not expecting her back.  Yeah.  Nah, not now.  She's got too much crazy stuff.  Do you think we should get a helicopter and try to helicopter her out of there?  Out of Charlie's backyard?  She'd fucking...  No.  She'd treat the helicopter like fucking...  Like when Carter tried to get the hostages out.  She'd throw sand up in it.  She wants no part of leaving there.  She's having a good time.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  The Wesley Snipes, how long is that?  Oh, I love that.  Four minutes?  You want to play it now?  Might as well.  E-Roc's got the chubby checker, too.  Oh, boy.  Why would you say something like that?  It just opens up.  Checkers for everybody else.  Did you hear about the Mayo story while you were gone?  E-Roc?  Um, no, but thanks to everybody on Twitter, I heard that you guys were discussing it, so... 
[00:43:00]  Well, we were saving all the good stuff for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Big truck...  Just so you enjoy the Mayo.  A shitload of Mayo onto the highway.  Yeah.  And you weren't around.  We were very suspicious.  Yeah.  He got me.  He's running Mayo over the state lines.  I'm running illegal Mayo.  Right.  To Texarkana.  It's the remake of Smokin' the Bandit with E-Roc.  Mopey and the Bandit. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, God damn.  That is good.  Would you watch that movie?  Oh, my God, yeah.  E-Roc trying to fucking smuggle illegal mayonnaise.  Over state lines.  Over state lines.  There he is.  There he is.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Yeah.  We've got it all way to go.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  Keep your foot hard on the pedal.  Jerry Reed.  It's a good tune.  Great.  Let's all hang out, cause we gotta run to big.  Come on, E-Roc.  We gotta get this through.  We got us a Smokin' report.  Yeah, big bad Smokin' report coming up for you there, E-Roc. 
[00:44:30]  No, not a cop.  Smoked bacon up at the next section.  Oh!  So put the spoon to the metal plate, and we'll see you on the flip-flop.  They gotta take a 10-100.  Then that's his weight. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, poor E-Roc.  I can't think of one thing that ties it with Smokin' and the Bandit.  I'm just enjoying that song.  Well, Snafu writes, uh, Smokin' and the BLT.  No Diablo sandwich, Dr. Pepper?  Oh, make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Thank you, nice lady.  Uh, Smokin' and the Lap Bandit.  Lap Bandit.  Kentucky Muscat, thank you. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  That's a good tune.  I'm gonna have to watch that movie.  It's one of those, uh, some parts still hold up as a little 70s action movie.  Others, you're kind of like, oof.  Yeah.  Dude, fuckin', Gleeson is still hilarious in that thing.  Yes.  In the first one, brilliant.  The lines in that movie, to me, that's one of the funniest lines ever, is after his fuckin' 
[00:46:00]  hat blows off.  Yeah.  Daddy, my hat blew off.  I hope your goddamn head was in it.  God, oh my, I wanna say something that funny on film once in my life.  Yeah, he was great.  Oh, was he fuckin' great?  A great one.  He was a funny guy in that.  Yeah.  Do you want your, uh, Wesley Snipes, or do you want the Chubby Checker going to break?  Oh, boy.  What do you wanna do today?  I'd like to hear the Wesley.  What do you want to do?  The Wesley.  Let's do the Wesley.  Hey, uh, after the break, a little later, I think 7.30, we got, uh, Topher Grace coming 
[00:46:30]  in.  Saw his latest movie last night.  Wasn't bad.  No.  Wasn't a bad movie.  What's it called?  Uh, Take Me Home Tonight, right?  It's like an 80's spoof movie.  Yeah, it's opening this Friday, so we'll talk to him.  And, um, oh, and, uh, we're gonna play a little game after the break called Charlie Sheen  or The Ultimate Warrior.  I could totally see where that's going.  Yes.  So, we'll do that, but first. 
[00:47:00]  Well, no, we're talking about Wesley Snipes.  Oh, we did talk about Wesley Snipes.  We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna stag into that.  Three, he gets three years.  Yeah.  You can't put Blade away, though, for three years.  Which I think is.  And three federal years.  That's a long time.  Where's he gonna hide?  In the Congo?  Yeah, where's he going?  Here's your first night in prison.  You know you got three years to go.  You're sitting on that nasty bed.  And some goofy ass asking you about, hey, man, does Woody really smoke?  That smoke that much weed?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Do you really think white men can't jump?  And is there a lot of money on that train, for real?  And there he is in the joint.  Hey, man, let me ask you something.  How come you can live in a day, and the other ones can't?  Tell him you never really explain that.  You never really explain that.  You never really explain that.  Yo, you ain't so bad without your sword.  Oh, damn. 
[00:48:00]  And he'd just be like, uh-oh, here it goes.  Now I gotta fight.  Now I gotta fight.  Yeah, you look like you kicked a lot of ass in that movie.  Hey, how come you didn't just get frozen?  How come you just didn't get frozen like Demolition Man?  Well, it was a picture.  It was a movie I was making.  Man, if I could get frozen like y'all come back in the year 23, 22.  Cars be flying.  You're stupid, Wesley. 
[00:48:30]  You asked the long shit that got frozen like you did in that movie.  Come out and beat up the cops because they don't know nothing about what you do.  Yeah.  You should have got frozen and came back when there's no sustaining taxes.  I'd have waited until the Statue of Limitations was up on the tax trap, Wesley.  He's right.  You is stupid.  I'm like, how'd you get caught?  Why'd you just go to your Blade Lair?  And have Chris Christopherson all hired you? 
[00:49:00]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Nigga, you better not bite me when I'm asleep.  The sad part of this, this is the first five minutes of a three-year set.  Yeah, the three-year set.  This is just the first five minutes.  He's being a prison barber.  The dude flicks the thing for the night.  So what you want?  You want the Blade Cut?  Or the Demolition Man?  Because we, I don't, you know, die is expensive.  That would be 17 cigarettes for the Demolition Man and 10 for the Blade Cut. 
[00:49:30]  And even the guard says, even when he comes in, the guard got him.  Yeah, you ain't going to be able to jump over the fence like you do in Blade.  Everything is one of his movies.  Yeah, they just got to get on him about that all the time now.  He'll just be there like, he's got, he's there, he's just got one, one scratched in his wall.  He's got like a thousand to go.  Oh, poor Danny.  Oh my God. 
[00:50:00]  Poor Wesley.  The Aryan Brotherhood comes up.  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Snipes?  How are you?  I heard you think we can't jump.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I didn't say it was just a movie.  Yeah.  We're going to see how high you can jump.  I love your movies there, boy.  Them some good movies.  I see you, you beat up a lot of white people in that movie, didn't you?  Oh.  Wesley's just, uh.  I'd like to say that Blade fought off the sisters. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, no.  But he did not have that thought to stop the sisters.  It went on for years.  I'm about to throw a blade off this roof.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I know a lot about taxes.  I know a lot about taxes.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, it's very good.  Wesley Snipes doing three years.  Wait a minute.  Just end it like that.  There you go.  We got to move on.  He's in the joint.  And that's what we got on that.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  We got Topher Grace coming into the studio.  Well, maybe.  He's got to walk down the 100-yard hallway still.  That is a long-ass hallway. 
[00:51:30]  He's in a new movie called Take Me Home Tonight in theaters Friday.  Green Mile.  Take Me Home Tonight is set in the 80s, Anthony.  It follows an aimless college grad who pursues his dream girl at a wild Labor Day weekend party.  Topher stars in the film as Matt Franklin.  Why not just star as Topher?  I don't know.  Matt Franklin.  I never noticed the names of the characters.  And with that, Topher Grace has entered the studio. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Topher.  How you doing?  Morning to you.  Oh, you're a Yankees fan.  Dude, I'm a good fan of yours, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thank you.  We got the same hat.  Oh, yeah, what a coincidence.  What a coincidence, man.  Here in New York.  Wow, really going out on a limb.  I wear this in L.A., though.  That's pretty good.  Oh, that's kind of brave.  You take it off in Boston, though, right?  You know I wore Red Sox at when I went to Boston.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  You're a smart move.  He's a true politician.  Get into the Yankees suck chant, wherever you are in Boston. 
[00:52:30]  I love how he said, I'm a big fan of Jim Norton.  And then he goes, and of you guys, too.  He doesn't know.  Oh, Jim Norton.  I'm from Connecticut, originally.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, that's good to know.  Where in Connecticut?  Darian.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I used to drive through there occasionally.  A little much to the bridge portion.  Thanks for the shout-out, man.  Connecticut's always been one of those states you drive through going somewhere else.  Trust me, when you go up there, it's the wrong place to talk about it.  But, yeah.  No, 95, dude, doing gigs, Route 95 going through Connecticut, it's probably the worst stretch 
[00:53:00]  of road in the country, because it's all the same.  There's never not traffic.  I've never once, 3 o'clock in the morning, 2 o'clock in the afternoon, it's always stop  and go.  When I moved to LA, people were like, how bad is it traveling?  I'm like, not really that bad.  I grew up right on I-95.  There's nothing compares to that.  You've got to leave at 10 in the morning so you don't catch the, you know, what is  them?  Traffic.  Big fan of you guys.  Thank you.  Great work.  Big fan.  That's exactly what I thought it would be.  I was watching the wheels come off that thought as you had it. 
[00:53:30]  I want to say morning commute, but the afternoon commute, even.  No, you have to time it perfectly.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't do the math.  Like, you're good at math in this.  Okay.  I'm fucking it all up.  I was just watching your face, so you're like, you have to leave at 10, and I just  saw your eyes open, like, I don't know what the next word is.  Because we used to drive to Boston, and it would take forever, because you hit every  city's fucking traffic jam.  Yeah, it's hideous.  But then I was trying to do the math in my head, and I fucked it all up.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry, Tom.  Okay, no, I heard that.  Can we start over?  I've messed up a couple times.  You know, they sent us around the country with the film.  Yeah.  Oh, okay, so this is serious.  All right.  Yeah.  You can send it whatever you want.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy and I saw the movie last night.  Take me home tonight.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was good, man.  A glowing review of Not Bad.  Thank you so much.  Not Bad.  The glowing review that you gave.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  I enjoy it.  It's more than not bad.  I liked it.  Thank you.  It's like the thing that was, it was like, it was set in the 80s, and I'm like, okay. 
[00:54:30]  I'll tell you, when I started to like the movie, it was literally a minute into it was  when the fucking chick walks into the Suncoast video, and you run out, and just, and change  your clothes, and running like an ass, and it just started to make me laugh, and watching  you interact with her.  It's like, when I watch people act, I'm like, it's hard to do comedic acting, and it was  just fucking funny, his reactions to her.  He's trying to be casual, and I can't describe it, but it made me laugh out loud, and I'm 
[00:55:00]  like, goddammit, I suck.  You don't have to tell anyone you can't describe it.  That is true.  But I just go, the face you made.  I really should be killed.  Good radio.  What you're saying is you have to see it in the theater to really manage it.  Yeah, it made me laugh.  Exactly.  Like opening night, right?  Yes.  Yes.  It made me laugh.  Full fare.  When does it open?  Friday night.  Friday.  This Friday, yeah.  We got weird copies of the movie, because I guess they're scared that me and Jimmy are going  to make a thousand copies and go down to Chinatown and start selling this thing.  No other 500.  So our copy was a little dark.  I don't think that's outside the realm of the possibility.  It was a little dark. 
[00:55:30]  And now what they do for us is they put our name on the screen, so now they know if we're  bootlegging where they came from.  And they're letting us know, because they could do it subtly.  Like, they mark scripts, and they send out a script.  They'll put, like, little anomalies in each script so they know if somebody has copied it.  But this one, they're just like, Opie and Anthony.  So, idiots, you know.  We know who to copy it.  I really don't want to see my name the entire film.  Can you change that for us?  You know when they sent you on a junket like this, which shows they really want you to  do.  I know you guys are downplaying your thing, but they were psyched that I was coming on 
[00:56:00]  this show.  Oh, that's cool.  Definitely.  How is it working with...  No one's ever said that.  No.  It's true.  I know.  We don't know how to take a compliment.  This studio is like, you're going on opening in Anthony.  Yeah.  Like, it's happening.  How is it working with Anna?  Anna Faris.  She's amazing.  You know, it's like you were talking about.  We wanted to make one of those John Hughes films that I grew up loving.  Yeah.  Which, I love all the films that have come out about the 80s, but they're all making  fun of the 80s.  Like, the joke is like what people are wearing.  Right, right, right. 
[00:56:30]  That huge cell phone.  We wanted to make the first one that wasn't a spoof.  It was like we went back in a time machine.  And Anna was the first one who was kind of in and kind of, she was down.  And she understood what it was.  I mean, she's almost like kind of dramatic at some points.  Right, yeah, yeah.  It's also really funny.  But she is like maybe the coolest chick alive.  She's awesome.  She's probably sick of doing spoof movies.  So it's like, good.  Yeah, yeah.  I could just do this.  I'll play this one straight.  She's been away from the spoof movies for a while now. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  And everything she's in, she's hilarious.  Yeah.  She's a very pretty girl.  She can do the character stuff too, and she's fantastic at it.  But I think, you know, we all grew up on those movies.  You know, like Breakfast Club and 16 Candles and Say Anything.  The music in the movie.  Dude, and they got the camera stuff right too.  Like, there was camera angles.  Like, you're like, oh yeah, the party scene.  When you walk into the party scene, and like 80 movies would focus on the, on the, the way  they focus on the faces, the way they pan the crowd.  It's like, that's exactly what they did in fucking 1984. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, it really was like just like a time machine.  Oh man, thank you.  That's exactly what we were going for.  Also, like, doing it was fun.  Like, when you're in a drama that's like depressing, you are depressed for like three months.  Like, no one, like, that's why they give you awards for those movies.  But like, this was, I mean, I'm not a method actor.  You know, as to say, if I'm playing like a blind dude, I don't like wear a blindfold.  Yeah, I have to do that for it, yeah.  I was so fucking method on this movie.  Because like, on the days off, we would just go up to the set of the house. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And party our asses off.  It was like, it was the most fun I've ever had.  You were probably more of a 90s guy growing up.  Like, that was your time?  Yeah.  Not really 80s.  Probably starting, yeah, like mid 90s.  I'm kind of aware of pop music.  Yeah.  Yeah, so where did you get the 80s vibe from?  Were there people saying like, hey, this is kind of what you did.  You never, you didn't talk like that or.  Right, right.  We did have some, yeah, we had to like interview some of our older friends and kind of.  Oh, really? 
[00:58:30]  Like, hey, asshole, what'd you say when that would happen?  You know, at the beginning I'd say to the max.  I was like, did people really say that?  Yuck.  But we didn't do it like, you know, how they call attention to it in some of these movies  and it's silly.  Yeah, yeah.  For real.  It really came out of, in the 90s, I went to boarding school in Massachusetts.  But when I was there, I was a big fan of Dazed and Confused.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, fuck yeah.  So I had wanted to do a John Hughes movie, but we didn't know how to do it present day.  You know, I wanted to work with a young cast.  And, you know, those movies, they weren't really a drama or a comedy. 
[00:59:00]  They kind of had everything.  But then my friend, who became my producing partner on this, had the idea of, like, if  you look at Dazed and Confused, which was done in the 90s about the 70s, you look at American  Graffiti, which was done in the 70s about the 50s, if we did one of those now, it would  be, it would take us back to when John Hughes was actually making movies.  Right.  So we kind of mashed the two ideas up.  You know what he was great at, John Hughes?  Yeah, that worked out.  The use of music in his movies was fucking, it's like things that you, on paper, you 
[00:59:30]  go, that's cheesy to play that song at that moment.  But when you watch it emotionally, it's like, ugh, it fucking works.  Yeah.  You don't want it to affect you, but it does.  And that was what Hughes was great at.  And this, there's a lot of, you would hear the music starting low when the moment was  happening in this.  I was like, God damn it.  That is exactly what the fuck it is.  Yeah.  They figured it out.  It's very nostalgic for people who grew up in the 80s.  Like, you know, I'm a little older than I look.  Like, I'm fucking depressing to know that at 84 I was in high school. 
[01:00:00]  On that 70s show, it was pretty much like, that was the time I was actually that age and  doing that dumb stuff.  An American graffiti.  And that was, shut up, you asshole.  It was Birth of a Nation, right?  It was the film.  Birth of a Nation, yeah.  Might as well go all the way back.  But it was, that was also my political affiliation.  Yeah.  So, that I found, like, I could really relate to that, a lot of the same shit of the bad 
[01:00:30]  station wagon and the girls that you couldn't get and shit like that.  Generational things that you're talking about is there are two audiences.  There's the audience that's kind of swimming in nostalgia for the music and the situation.  And then there's the audience that is discovering all of it.  And they're both equally valid.  I mean, I didn't know anything about the 70s.  And I didn't know that much about the 80s.  But it's great to, you know, the first thing we did was we made a mixtape.  Like an 80s.  And like the way we didn't want to spoof, you know, have those lines in the movie that 
[01:01:00]  are like, there'll be hover cars by 1995.  And the sound just winks at the camera.  Because there's not.  Right?  It's so true, though.  We're like, how tiny is this cell phone?  It's like, okay.  But we also cut out of this mixtape, you know, Rock Me Amadeus.  Like, Get Out of My Dreams.  Anything that dated it.  You know, it was like the Who Let the Dogs Out of Its Time.  You know, like, we want it to be a really kick-ass soundtrack.  It's songs you want to hear today still, you know. 
[01:01:30]  I love the DeLorean.  Oh, you saw the DeLorean?  Yeah, you got to look quick.  Yeah, but I noticed he was leaving the party in this movie, Take Me Home Tonight.  And there was a DeLorean parked in the...  You were badass if you had a DeLorean back then.  But it wasn't like...  It was subtle, though.  That's what you're getting at right now.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm like a huge Back to the Future.  There are like five different references to Back to the Future in the movie.  I just love that movie.  Yeah.  You did a music video or something with...  Yeah, the cast did a music video.  And we did like...  That was actually where we got all of our...  We had all this kind of leftover spoof, you know, energy that we wanted. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's by Atomic Tom, if you want to check it out.  Yeah.  I hear it's great.  I haven't checked it out yet myself.  We actually...  I'm a huge Back to the Future fan, so it was Danny.  We went to the movie theater and watched it when it was re-released in theaters.  Oh, wait.  When was that?  It was like a few months ago.  Oh, seriously?  Yeah.  Well, it was supposed to be the 25th anniversary of when they were actually supposed to go back  in time in the movie. 
[01:02:30]  So I guess that had to be October, right?  Was it?  Yeah, something like that.  No, dude, don't pretend like you don't know.  I see what you're doing.  I know.  I'm fucking sick of it already.  I'm sick.  I'm tired of Back to the Future already.  Thank God.  Finally.  Finally.  Yeah, because every asshole has to be like, oh, did you see this?  Did you see this?  Yes.  I saw all of it.  All of it I saw.  The game, all the behind-the-scenes shit, all the fucking old stills of what's-his-fucking-fair.  I saw all of it.  Well, that's great, Danny.  Now our audience, knowing how they are, will just stop.  They won't send you a thousand of the same thing now over and over. 
[01:03:00]  There's a new game on the iPhone.  Yes.  I know.  Yes.  You guys did it to yourself, though.  Yeah, we kind of did.  The show got taken over by Back to the Future for a while there.  But who doesn't love it?  I hate it.  Oh, yeah.  That was amazing.  I'm sorry.  I know that's what you're talking about, but that was amazing.  It's so, like, I'm used to it.  It would have been great if they combined it and he was Marty McMask.  They've got to take that lightning harness. 
[01:03:30]  They just tape it to his face.  Shoot his head out the sunroof.  Mom's trying to send me to the future.  Yes, ugly.  Of course she is.  Ugly.  It's terrible.  Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool, though.  But you did see some people that pulled up in DeLoreans and stuff, and they're just like,  all right, you're taking it a little too far.  It is a movie.  Oh, that, like, yeah.  Yeah, at the theater, they're like, oh, boy.  What is this, Rocky Horror?  Well, my thought behind that was I had the DeLorean for the evening.  I had the tickets to the moon.  Yeah, so I showed up. 
[01:04:00]  But I had the vest.  It wasn't like I bought it, you know.  Who else did we see in Take Me Home Tonight?  Yeah, the guy who was...  The chubby guy.  Who was fucking really funny.  Really funny.  Dan Fogler.  It's like kind of a breakout for him, this movie.  He won the Tony here a couple years ago.  But I feel like I've seen him before.  Has he been in?  Yeah, he's in Balls of Fury.  Okay.  And Good Luck, Chuck.  Okay.  But this is like...  I mean, look.  I'm so glad this is on Sirius.  Like, it's been hard to, like, kind of talk about what happens in the film.  But, you know, the guy, you know, he basically does a bunch of nose candy. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  The first ten minutes and then goes apeshit for the entire movie.  It's a great role for anybody.  It's one long night.  Yeah.  He made me laugh.  There was a scene where you're on the phone with him and you're calling and he's like a Mercedes dealer.  And listening to him act like you're his boss and he's trying to get the guy a deal, I was like, oh, what a fucking twat car salesman.  But that guy was really funny.  And the one thing I liked, too, is there was scenes where it was a fucking 80 movies party scene.  And then they went to the rich party in Beverly Hills. 
[01:05:00]  And it was like, it just, it captured perfectly the way the movies would stereotype, like, the rich stuffy people and the crazy rich kids.  And, yeah, it really grabbed everything.  So if you like 80s movies, see it because I enjoyed it.  We wanted to have one of each scene and not have it go the place it went in every movie.  Meaning, like, we wanted to have him steal a car.  We wanted to have him have, like, a girl who was his platonic best friend.  But then we wanted to subvert every, you know, it's like his twin sister.  So, you know, it's not going to go there. 
[01:05:30]  They get caught with the car.  Or, like, you know, Chris Pratt, who's amazing in it, who's, you know, on Parks and Rec.  He actually, he asked Anna to marry him and they actually, they got married in real life.  Oh, wow.  Are they married in real life?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they're married in real life now.  It's, like, crazy.  But that role would have been easy for him to be like,  you know, I'm just going to fucking cheat on her.  Yeah, right, right.  But we wanted to, he's actually, like, totally in love with her entire movie.  It doesn't, oh, it doesn't go there.  Well, kind of, you know, we just wanted to, like, have all the conventions.  And also, we wanted the music to get a little bit weirder as the movie wanted. 
[01:06:00]  You know, we wanted to just subvert every kind of 80s convention.  But we also wanted to have every 80s convention.  Like that girl thing you're talking about at the mall at the beginning.  We want to have all those scenes.  And the other blonde that was after you at the party.  Was she after me, though?  Well, she wanted you.  Oh, you mean the other one.  She's kind of cross-eyed.  What I'm after is pretty small.  She's kind of cross-eyed.  Lucy Punch, yeah, she's amazing.  She's hilarious.  She's amazing.  She only has a small role, unfortunately, in Take Me Home Tonight.  She was in that dumb movie that I hated, Dinner with the Schmucks. 
[01:06:30]  I didn't see that.  Dinner for Schmucks.  Dinner with Schmucks, whatever.  She's amazing.  I actually just did another movie with her.  She was really funny in that movie.  And, yeah.  And Demetri Martin?  You know Demetri Martin, right?  Fucking Demetri.  God damn it.  I hate seeing comics be that good.  He was fantastic in that movie.  Did he know what to do with his hands?  Yeah, he held him on the side of his wheelchair.  Demetri was fucking hilarious in that movie.  I knew he did a Woodstock film, and he's a very popular stand-up.  People know Demetri, but he was really fucking funny in this movie.  We wanted to have a scene where you show how low my character's gotten, 
[01:07:00]  so we have this paraplegic dude who's basically making fun of me.  Yeah.  He's like, you're depressing me.  What happened to you?  And he goes, I got hit by a drunk driver after graduation,  but I'm not letting it hold me back.  It was really fucking funny.  It made me laugh.  Yeah, Demetri was fucking great.  It made me sick to see a comedian I know doing that well.  I've got to yell at Roland for not giving me a copy.  I have my copy.  I'll give it to you, but I fucking forgot he was in that.  So whenever I see comics I know, it's like, you know,  you're never really happy for them. 
[01:07:30]  Believe me.  And I'm not happy for Demetri,  where I used to drive to fucking open mics  and drop off when he was a medical student or whatever he was doing.  I'm not happy to see him doing films at all.  And he hates you.  He used to talk about it all the time.  I know he does.  He really hates you.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  Please.  He looks at his college checks.  He forgot my name.  Oh, that guy.  Do you guys from like the cast from That 70s Show,  do you get almost competitive with each other?  Like if you get a good gig, are you like, eh, get a good gig?  No, well, you know, Ash and I were just in a Valentine's Day together, 
[01:08:00]  so we got to hang out, you know, promoting it.  And there was a moment where we were like in Europe or something,  and the movie had just done $100 million.  And I was like, I've known this guy since I was a teenager.  Yeah.  We're like in our 30s now.  And we were looking at each other like,  how much success can you share with another person?  This is fantastic.  Like he's dancing with Demetri on the dance floor,  and like I'm hanging out with like Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel,  and I was like, say lovey. 
[01:08:30]  How are you?  It was crazy.  Life is great.  Living the Charlie Sheen lifestyle.  Yeah.  I mean, here's the thing about Chuck, man.  He's a good guy.  That's what everybody says.  I talked to him last night, man.  Everyone in Hollywood is his friend all of a sudden.  But I love his whatever technique he's using.  I really love it, man.  It's like maybe the best thing that's ever happened.  It's never been tried before.  It's uncharted celebrity territory,  because usually the publicist tells you to shut the fuck up, 
[01:09:00]  or somebody will keep you off of interviews,  and he's just doing this, here I am.  Unfiltered.  There it is.  Charlie Sheen unfiltered.  Unfiltered.  It's totally honest.  Yeah, yeah.  Except for the, I'm not doing crack part.  But it's great.  It's just, you know, it's a fun way to be entertaining.  To, like, handle it.  And we're just all vultures.  I mean, we really are.  I don't know, man.  He's going on all these shows.  Don't be too hard on yourself. 
[01:09:30]  You know, you're right as far as that goes.  But, damn, we love to watch any kind of car wrecks like that.  The Mel Gibson thing.  I don't know how many times we've listened to that tape.  That was fun, too.  Yeah.  You know, that was hysterical.  A new tape coming out every day.  But, man, I have no fun.  I mean, I really am like, I am no fun.  I'm like a Boy Scout.  So, whenever this happens to someone, I'm like, yeah.  He had way too much fun.  And now they're going to pay.  Good.  Are you, uh, no scandal in your life, really.  No, but that means I'm boring.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Nah.  No, but that means that girls will trust you and sleep with you.  They're smart.  That's a smart.  He's the smart way to be.  Because they know that he'll keep it under his hat.  Nobody fucks me.  A, because I'm unattractive.  And B, because I'm on the radio with a big mouth.  And I can't shut up about it.  I know.  God damn it.  The second we have a day where we're like, uh.  Yeah, what are we going to talk about?  A little lull in the news.  It's like, well, I'll talk about the time I shit my pants.  Hey, Jim, you fucked Jerry from the Facts of Life.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got to fill up this time. 
[01:10:30]  But, you know, Charlie, we kill publicists because sometimes they're fucking horrible to deal with.  But in this case, you do understand that they're, like I said, his publicist was really a genius.  Because that's a hard one, not even to make it look good, but just to not make it look awful.  To contain for all those years, right?  Yeah, like Cruz's publicist.  Because Cruz went a little bit nuts at one point.  And you saw, like, wow, the publicists at some point do function like a very legit purpose.  It's just when they get overprotective and they don't let the actors say anything.  You've been on sitcoms.  Like, it is such an easy job.  Like, I mean, really, it is like as cush as, I mean, that guy was making so much money. 
[01:11:00]  You really have to show up, like, a couple days a week, say the lines.  I mean, they were willing to do whatever for him.  You know, but look, he's having more fun than me.  Like I said, he's definitely having more fun.  Did you, you left the 70s show, like, a year before they wrapped it up?  Yeah, I did it for, I had to do it for six years.  And then I did an extra year.  Did you want to?  Or it was just like, wow, that's some righteous bucks.  You had to, you mean contractually?  No, not contractually. 
[01:11:30]  But just kind of, you know, if you've really enjoyed your experience.  And we had, like, a lot of fun.  And, I mean, all the kids were friends.  And it was, like, you know, like I was saying, I mean, it's, like, really fun to do.  Yeah.  But by the end, it's like, you know each other's rhythms.  So it's, like, not easy is the wrong word, because it is a lot of hard work.  But it was, like, you know, a great way to make a living.  I wanted to do that extra year.  But then Ashton was leaving, and some of the head writers were leaving.  I thought, this is a good time.  You've got to, at some point, kind of say, this is going to end. 
[01:12:00]  Did you have a lot of shit, like, in the pipe there?  Or were you kind of, like, scared, like, kind of, oh, fuck?  Well, I left to do Spider-Man, which, you go, this movie's probably going to do well.  Yeah, this might make a couple of bucks.  Yeah, but, you know, but it is, it's exciting, and it's scary, you know, it's, I'm actually  seriously not trying to segue into talking about the movie.  I swear to God.  No, no, please.  I'm literally not.  But that is literally exactly what the character's going through.  It's why I was so interested in this film, is because there's, like, you know, when structure 
[01:12:30]  ends, you know, you've been in middle school and high school and college, and then, you  know, it's like, you almost have too much freedom, you know.  Would it make choice?  And I was nervous about that, because I had gone from, like, you know, high school to  college to the show.  There was a certain, you know, we'd have summers off, and we'd go do a movie, and then you come  back, and there's this structure.  So it was kind of scary and exciting, and it's, and now, like, when we see each other, 
[01:13:00]  it's great.  Like, I just, I played, I had to speak Russian in a movie, and Mila Kunis is Russian.  Oh, helped you out.  It's so funny.  Everyone talks about it.  I've known her since she was 14.  Like, it's crazy, but she's like a, you know.  Yeah, and now she's on the, she was on the Oscars, and they were sexing it up and everything.  Yeah, when guys talk about it, I mean, she's great.  But I got to call her and kind of say, like, you know, run some Russian by her, and I, you  know, I got to.  Does this sound right?  No, I, I, I spoke this whole speech I'd learned phonetically, and she goes, oh my gosh, 
[01:13:30]  amazing, what did you say?  Oh, she doesn't speak it?  No, she speaks it fluently.  Oh, she was fucking with you.  She was great in Black Swan.  Yeah.  Really sexy role.  Really sexy.  I've seen that movie.  Fuck yeah, man.  I, it was, it was, it was so, uh, we were talking about how Aronofsky shot it, like, so,  all in close-up, and it just, it gives you this, like, claustrophobic, like, get out of  my face.  Something is wrong in feeling the entire thing. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, it was, really was an interesting movie.  Yeah.  Did you see the Oscars?  I did.  Yeah.  What'd you think of James?  Uh, I know both of, uh, both James and Annie Hathaway, I was in Valentine's Day with,  and I actually knew her since I kind of moved out to LA.  We were like each other's first friends.  She was on a show on Fox that I don't, that doesn't get as much attention.  What show was she on?  Um, she never did a thing after that, either.  It was that show.  I forget if it was, it was called, like, Get Real or something. 
[01:14:30]  No.  No, it was fun.  It was her and Jesse Eisenberg.  And they're both at the Oscars, and it was crazy to watch, but, uh, and, you know, and  Mila's up there, it was, it's weird to watch your peer group.  Yeah, yeah.  Post the Oscars, I mean, uh, I love both of those guys.  Yeah, that's pretty huge.  I wouldn't know.  Uh, I watch my fucking peer group in the same place every morning.  I've never seen a peer do anything important.  Fucking horrible.  Bob Kelly is my peer.  Because, uh, James Franco was catching a lot of flack for, like, people were like, is he 
[01:15:00]  high?  Is he just like that?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, he kind of has, but I think any time I've seen him, he's had, like, the  half-masked eyes and kind of just...  He is, like, the coolest guy.  We went around the world for Spider-Man Press, and I got teamed with him a lot because we're  both kind of bad guys in it.  And, uh, he's...  He's, like, the funniest guy.  I mean, if you...  Have you guys ever met him?  Has he been in here?  No.  Not yet.  No?  He is, like, the funniest guy.  Really?  And the coolest guy.  Like, I mean, legit. 
[01:15:30]  Like, not, like, on the air, like, when you're off the air, hanging out, like, later that  night or whatever, he's, like, a really cool dude.  It's hard, too, because, like, it's hard to badmouth people when you're in the business,  like, because...  No, I would.  You give me the right person.  I would badmouth them.  No, I'd say, like, a lot of people won't because it's, like, it's not even that they're  pussies not to.  It's, like, hard because you bump into people and they're really nice.  It's, like, I've badmouthed people that I've met that I'm, like, ugh, I feel like such  a dick.  I don't want to badmouth that person anymore because they were pleasant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, once you meet somebody that you think they're a dick, you never met him, you have no reason to 
[01:16:00]  not like him.  Yeah.  And then it's, like, um...  And then when you meet him...  That's the opposite, is when you can't watch someone who's actually really talented because  they're such a jerk when you're going to dance a ball.  Such an ass, yeah, when you meet him.  I've never had that.  I've never had that where I've met somebody who was such a...  Talk about people that met you.  Oh.  See that difference, Jimmy?  Anthony always turns on me when there's A-list celebrities here.  No, because they all know you and like your comedy.  I get all jealous.  Don't be jealous.  They just remember you as the fat pig friend from Lucky Louie.  Oh, yeah, you're the one that did the same face in every scene. 
[01:16:30]  I remember you.  Oh, you know what?  Did you, uh...  Did you guys, when you were doing the 70s show, did you think when they came out with  that 80s show, like, what the fuck are you doing?  Like, you're saturating it.  And that was a horrid example of how to do an 80s-based thing.  It was the opposite of what we're going for here.  I'm talking on a cellular phone.  It's a mobile phone.  It's amazing.  I'm not even...  It's like, yeah, we get it.  It was all over the top. 
[01:17:00]  It was so in your face, over the top, like, smashed at you, that this is something from  the 80s.  Yeah, I'll tell you a story that I...  This is a good story that I probably shouldn't tell.  Oh, good.  Which is, um, no one ever, like, talked to us about it.  Like, it wasn't...  It's not a bad thing, either.  Look, they're, um, they were very successful producers because of our show and other shows  they'd done.  They kind of...  I mean, what would they do?  Like, call a powwow?  Or they say, like...  They kind of come in and just... 
[01:17:30]  Well, you would think that would be kind of a decent thing to do.  At least let you guys know, like, because you're pretty invested in that 70s show.  But they really don't have to.  I mean, it's...  No, they're not having to and just doing it.  I agree, I agree.  Yeah.  So they kind of said, like...  We kind of found out about it.  Like, uh...  Like, I found out about, sadly, in an interview where someone said, what about that 80s show?  I said, oh, well, I don't think we're going to go there.  Oh, oh, shit!  And I was like, whoops!  No, they went through.  So, uh, so I...  I mean, look, these people gave me my whole life and career. 
[01:18:00]  So I wasn't mad about it.  And I thought, all right, how do I show kind of, like...  Because we're all going to be seeing each other.  So I put on this huge fake mustache and went in and tried out.  Because I think the lead role, the only description was, like, a Topher Grace type.  Oh, shit!  And so I went in with this mustache.  And, like, I brought in a headshot that had, like, the mustache drawn onto it.  And I was like, uh, like, hello?  My name's Ron DeLashmitt.  But I'm here trying out for... 
[01:18:30]  Let's do this.  And I read...  And, like, I think it went for, like, a while.  And people were kind of nervous laughing.  It was, like, kind of weird.  Is he making a goof of this whole thing?  I don't know.  It was just weird.  It was such a...  I thought it was funny.  I'm so stupid.  At least you didn't have to last...  At least you didn't have to go through too much of that.  Because it didn't last very long.  I'm so stupid.  I almost said, did they know it was you?  But I edited myself.  Good.  That would have been humiliating for everybody involved.  Very good, Jimmy.  Of course they knew it was him.  Because they asked for Grace. 
[01:19:00]  You know, actually, the guy who got the lead on that show is a really good friend of mine.  Which is Glenn Howerton, who's on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  And went on to be, like, a billionaire.  Oh, yeah.  Because he actually created and wrote that show.  Great show.  And he's a...  I actually just emailed him last night.  He's a really great, talented guy.  He plays Dennis on It's Sunny.  How long...  Look at...  Damn.  I can't believe that's the same guy.  Yeah.  I didn't realize he was in the 80s show.  That only last year.  Why are we promoting that 80s show?  I just did an 80s movie.  I know, I know.  It's terrible.  It's a total wrong place to be.  Because Anthony didn't get his copy, he's saying. 
[01:19:30]  But it's the long...  Of the movie.  You're promoting that 80s show.  No, I'm talking about that's the horrible way to portray something like that.  It's done awful.  No, Take Me Home Tonight is definitely a good movie.  Yes.  Definitely.  There was some very big laughs in it.  Thanks for the backup.  Did you say yes?  Yeah.  He didn't see the movie.  You've got to say something great about Anna Faris.  I was watching.  She's very pretty.  She's so talented.  I love those lips.  Yeah.  Sexy.  Very sexy lips.  It's very odd when you get such a pretty girl that can do comedy. 
[01:20:00]  Really funny.  All right.  That evens out.  Yeah.  There was also scenes with the dad, with his dad in the movie, where you don't see those  parental scenes anymore.  That was a staple of 80s movies, like these intense scenes where there's a lesson learned  with the parents.  We've got Michael Biehn.  Really?  Michael Biehn?  Yeah.  Michael Biehn.  Kyle Reese.  Yeah.  Kyle.  Fucking.  Oh, I didn't recognize the name.  Kyle.  Yeah.  We wanted to get someone from the 80s, but not someone who's...  That's who he...  God.  Kyle from the Terminator.  Yeah.  Terminator.  And he was in Alien.  Holy shit. 
[01:20:30]  That's right.  He's like The Rock.  He's like, we wanted someone who was successful in the 80s, but wasn't like, didn't exist since  the 80s.  You know, he's been in Grindhouse and tons of great films.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's amazing in it.  Yeah.  Dude, that's...  I was watching him.  It was annoying me so much to not figure out who he was.  And I'm like, I knew it was a Terminator.  I'm like, no, that's not fucking...  Was it Robert Patrick was the guy who played the T-1000?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the other one.  What the fuck is it?  That's who he was.  Okay.  How about IMDb?  What'd you do?  She didn't have your computer?  I fucked my girlfriend.  After I didn't go to IMDb, I just wanted to get a load off.  We watched the movie.  I knew Motorhead was going on. 
[01:21:00]  I'm like, I have to come and go to sleep or I'll regret not being at Motorhead right  now.  Yeah.  We wanted to make sure we...  That's what I did.  We wanted to make sure we saw his movie before he came in here.  Exactly.  I wanted to see the movie.  And I was actually only going to watch a few minutes of it.  I'm like, let me just see to get it.  And I wound up watching the entire movie.  Well, I want a goddamn copy.  Because I watched something really uplifting last night.  A friggin' documentary on Afghanistan.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I know.  This little kid in there.  Actually, I think he was 20 years old, but he came off like a kid.  He was like a midget.  And he's walking around going like, fuck the Taliban.  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  And at the end, they got a little graphic that says he was beheaded. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, great.  Was he really?  Yeah.  That's a wonderful night of TV.  I was like, oh, that must have been easy, though.  That's kind of how that...  That's funny, because that's how Take Me Home Tonight ends.  It ends with a surprise beheading.  You never see it coming, too.  For a foreshadowing of Al-Qaeda.  It gets really, really weird if you have five minutes.  People are crying and vomiting.  Yeah, Take My Breath Away starts playing, and all of a sudden a fucking sword comes out.  His head gets lopped off.  That sucked at the end.  Did you watch some movies? 
[01:22:00]  Did you watch anything like Fast Times or things like that to get like...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, a lot of less than zero.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, that house reminded me...  Yeah, we went for almost the...  We tried to find the exact same house.  Oh, really?  It was...  We shot in Arizona, so we couldn't go...  We actually found the exact same house in L.A., but we wanted to have...  You know, everything's reflected by a pool.  Like, once you...  All right.  We actually kind of crossed the tracks.  It's in the valley, the whole thing.  And then we go over...  You know, when I moved to L.A. from here, I didn't realize that there's kind of two Los Angeleses. 
[01:22:30]  There's the valley, which became really famous in the 80s, you know, valley girls and that whole thing.  Right.  So most of it takes place.  Now, that's more of a community.  And then you go over the hill into what's kind of Hollywood, and it's a whole other thing.  That's like a lot more kind of fabulous and cocaine.  So we have a point where they go to, like, a different party.  That's that scene.  That scene kills in a live audience.  Like, there's a scene where Dan Fogler has already done a batch of cocaine, and he's been in, like, a dance-off, and, you know, he's going nuts. 
[01:23:00]  And then...  And he's never done drugs in his life.  He's been very straight-laced up until then.  And then Angie Everhart.  Oh, that's a great scene.  Literally.  Not someone like...  Yeah.  It's Angie Everhart.  She comes up to him and says, like, is it snowing?  And he...  I'm, like, telling a story from my movie.  But I really think it's fun.  Who cares?  It is fun.  Go for it.  And she says...  He goes, I think it's, like, 70 degrees out right now.  She's like, no, are you...  Do you have cocaine on you?  And they go into this bathroom, and she starts seducing him, and he's never been with a girl like this.  And then this weird German dude walks in. 
[01:23:30]  I mean...  His name is Franz or something?  Yeah, she's like, we can do this, but he has to watch.  And you see Dan just look at this, like, supermodel, and then look over at this weird German dude's leather.  Yeah, this old fat...  He's like a fat...  He looks like Bernie Madoff.  That's exactly who he looks like.  Very creepy.  Just creepy and kind of laughing lightly.  And then she shows her big tits, and she's like, it's not negotiable.  And he tries to fuck it.  It was really funny, man.  He goes, like, I'm gonna give this a shot.  A shot.  And it's nice to see tits in a movie again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they took that out of most movies.  That's what we wanted, was that kind of hard R, where... 
[01:24:00]  It felt like...  You know, when you watch John Hughes' movies, they're actually pretty G-rated.  But we wanted that feeling of danger, where they're...  You know, it's not like, did he do cocaine?  Like, you see him do cocaine.  You see the tits.  But on the flip side, there's a romantic side to it.  But we didn't want to pull any punches.  I think it's most...  To answer your question, it's most like Fast Times.  Yeah, yeah.  Where there's great comedy, but, like, we didn't pull any punches.  You go, oh, I didn't know they were gonna go all the way.  Yeah, there is that kind of story there.  That path from Samus was great. 
[01:24:30]  And it was the stuff I love the most from anybody who...  It's like, when you pick up on things, when you know what they're doing, and immediately  it kind of, you know what they're doing, it's like, it just starts bringing back, like,  yeah, that's perfect, that's perfect, they got that right, they got that right.  It's really weird to watch a movie and be...  Knowing that they're doing an 80s movie and, like, realizing when they get it right.  Am I making any sense?  Like, that was kind of...  I like that a lot, though.  And those house scenes, the party scenes, and the fucking, the camera work was phenomenal.  Yeah, I actually had to go and get a picture in front of the Back to the Future house when 
[01:25:00]  I was out in L.A. over the summer.  Oh, wow.  I had to do that.  I was like, yeah, that house looks exactly the same as it did in the movie.  Well, why would you ever change something so perfect?  I know, I know.  And then, like, me and my chick were like, like, I was taking a picture of her, and then  she'd take a picture of me in front of the house, and then the neighbor came out, and  she's like, you want me to just take a picture?  She's so used to it, right?  Yeah, and we were like, yeah, and she goes, I said, yeah, you must be used to it, and  she goes, oh, there were times when buses would come by, and everyone on the bus would 
[01:25:30]  get off and take pictures in front of the house, and then drive away.  Oh, man, that's like one of my favorite movies.  Yeah, it's like, you know, we were there.  In the video, we do, we, like, actually drop out the music, and I do, like, my, like,  it's the only impression I kind of do, which I'm not going to do, and don't make me do it.  Don't make me do it.  But we, like, to get dressed up, and we did, like, you know, we do, like, 80s movies in  the video, but, like, that was the one I was really stoked about.  Do you have DVD plans, like, a commentary, or some extra shit, or things like that? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, there's a lot of outtakes.  Just, the cast is so young, and a lot of it was, you know, like, Dimitri, Chris Pratt,  and a lot of Dan's stuff, because he's so hyped on Coke, like, the whole movie.  Yeah.  Like, he, you know, we have so much outtakes and stuff.  There's going to be a lot of that.  He's a great yeller.  Yelling is not easy, and making it look funny on film.  Like, Kinison was obviously one of the greatest, but he reminded me of Kinison when he was screaming.  There's a scene towards the end where they're driving in the car, and he's just screaming something, 
[01:26:30]  and I'm like, that is a very Kinison-esque quality to him.  He's so blasted on Coke.  Yeah.  That he's literally, like, flying on top of this car.  I mean, he's like, it's great.  And then he kind of comes down, too, which is, like, really funny.  Yeah, he was fucking fantastic.  I enjoyed him a lot, and, you know, it's like, I'm high!  That was just me auditioning.  In case you do part two.  Wow, what a load, man.  I know, I know.  You got it.  I'm not really high.  I'm sober, but I just did that.  Oh, that was just acting?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  That's pretty good.  Oh, no, that's the Brady Bunch house. 
[01:27:00]  That's the Brady house.  I had to get one of those, too.  It likes sitcom houses.  I'm such a douche.  I've never seen any of those.  I'm such a douche.  I got one in front of O.J.'s old house.  Really?  Before they knocked it down?  I think I did, too, in front of the stairwell.  That's a smart one to get done.  That's history.  You had to, yeah.  That's not you.  It's some other dude.  Who is that?  Do you play this thing from the video?  Some other guy.  The middle part.  Yeah, yeah.  Get that thing going.  Sight.  Like, you know, as an actor, you don't really have a moment to, like, do a Back to the Future impression. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's great, man.  It's like if you wanted to do one cover, you know, you could get into a plan where you do too many covers.  Cool version of this song, by the way.  Yeah, they did a great job.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, this is heavy duty, Doc.  Are you telling me that you built a time machine? 
[01:28:00]  How did the DeLorean?  God damn, that's pretty good.  Not bad, though.  Not bad at all, Tom.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Oh, there's Danny in his top row.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't saying I'm good.  I was watching Danny in the talk.  That was a good impression, though.  Yeah, the mannerisms were all there.  Yeah, I don't do impressions, but that's a fucking hard one to do.  Michael J. Fox from the 80s is not one that anybody does.  Why did I just say that?  Who cares? 
[01:28:30]  Like, I just talked.  I care.  No, I care, man.  That's the only impression I do.  But literally, that would have had the same value if I said, yeah, I had two ginger ales,  but I only drank one.  Gives a fuck.  Nobody cares.  Asshole.  That's a good example.  It really is.  You should just edit.  Well, listen, we've got to get Topher out here.  You're doing a lot of TV today, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  And then we're going back to L.A.  and we've got a premiere.  It's going to be...  That's going to be fun, man.  The after party for this movie is going to be...  I can't wait to go, man.  Right.  About your invite. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  That is in the mail, man.  Yeah.  I'm waiting for it.  Now once I'll run home and look at my mailbox, I don't think it's here yet.  Yeah.  How am I going to go?  Oh, no, it's going to be Messenger.  It's going to be Messenger.  Oh, that would be so there.  Well, Michael Madsen's premiere is tonight, I think.  Yeah, we got invited to a premiere, right?  Yes, we did.  Oh.  Michael Madsen.  I must have lost my invite to that, so...  Yeah, see?  But his movie's going straight to DVD, man.  But still, we feel like we're...  Are you seriously going to Michael Madsen?  Yeah, he was here yesterday for an hour.  He was fucking...  We were talking...  You know the scene of Reservoir Dogs where he cuts the ear off, and he was walking through 
[01:29:30]  his process when he was shooting that scene.  It was fucking great watching the movie.  It was actually...  We had it on the computer, and we're watching it, and he was doing the live commentary just  sitting there talking about what was going through his mind, and what, you know, Quentin  was thinking, and some of the shit he was wearing, and it was really cool, like, because  he's such a badass.  People kind of forget because of Pulp Fiction, but that movie's...  Yeah, yeah, that one's really good.  I thought Reservoir Dogs was better.  It was just brilliant dialogue, and everybody was great.  It was new.  Like, you'd never seen... 
[01:30:00]  You were like, where did this guy come from?  Yeah, yeah, and to have something so cool with just, like, pretty much one set, that  was it.  It was just one fucking set, so you've got to depend on the actors.  And the dialogue back, the very quick dialogue between guys and the John, which Tarantino  tells you he got it from John, where the guns pointed at each other, and fuck, is that  a good movie?  The only other movie I've seen is Take Me Home Tonight.  It's as good as that.  We think...  Yes.  Probably. 
[01:30:30]  The scene where I chopped that guy's ear off, is where you're probably thinking that  it's the same.  Everyone's going to be so confused about this movie.  And so everyone's going to compare us, because we both have ear chopping.  And then Anna Faris...  My bad.  Anna Faris laying there in the warehouse, shot in the stomach the whole movie.  It just got depressed.  Look what is happening.  That would be awful, wouldn't it?  Oh, God.  Guys, this is so much fun.  Thank you for having me.  Well, let's get Toe Friday.  He's got to do TV.  The movie Take Me Home Tonight in theaters Friday.  Anything else you want to promote?  Let's see it.  You're good, right?  No, I want to come back and see you guys.  Yeah, please do, man. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, you should, man.  We don't want to have you back, man.  We don't have real celebrities in here.  Our new friend, Topher Grace.  Thank you, Topher.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel a hunger.  It's a hunger.  That tries to keep a man awake at night. 
[01:31:30]  Are you the answer?  I shouldn't wonder.  When I feel you whet my appetite.  With all the power you're releasing,  It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone.  Anticipation is running through me.  Let's find the key and turn this engine on.  I can feel you breathe.  I can feel your heartbeat faster. 
[01:32:00]  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Be my little baby.  Oh, oh.  Just like Ronnie sang. 
[01:32:30]  I say, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Baby, my darling.  Oh, oh, oh.  I feel a hunger.  It's a hunger.  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Be my little baby.  Oh, oh, oh.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Okay.  We is spelt here capital W, small I, small I.  I was confused during a read, and I actually said the Nintendo W2. 
[01:33:30]  because they use capital.  Look, I'm explaining myself, goddammit.  Let me see.  If you look here, right there, it says Nintendo W2.  Danny's just bashing me on this one.  I say, no, I say there's no excuse.  I say, when I'm going through that, that it should say W and then a small I and a small I,  then I would have said Nintendo Wii. 
[01:34:00]  I don't have a Wii, but I would have said Wii because I wouldn't have known.  I look at things like WW2 and see World War II, so I said a Nintendo, and I didn't know what the fuck it was.  That's why I delayed beforehand.  I'm like, a Nintendo, and I'm looking at it like, what the fuck is this?  And I said, a Nintendo W2.  I would have to go with Anthony on this one.  No, I have to go with Anthony on this one.  Because they like to capitalize copyright.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Older guys know that as W2.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry. 
[01:34:30]  I think the Nintendo Wii has been around long enough where if there's a W followed by two I's  and is prefaced by Nintendo, you should be able to know that's Wii.  No, no, I think, I think, but it's known as the logo, like, the logo itself is two small lowercase i's.  That's, that's kind of the, what it's known for.  Well, what if I asked you if you have any new apps for your e-phone, and then you tried to tell me,  no, that's an I, and I said, well, it's just a, it's a small I, so it's, it's, it's e-phone.  Well, if it said a one-phone in front of it.  Yeah, what if I said, what if I called it a one-phone?  Wouldn't you say that I'm retarded and I should know better? 
[01:35:00]  If it said an Apple one-phone, I'd be like, what the fuck is a one-phone?  But it would be capital I.  But I also have an iPhone and everything.  I don't own a Wii, but I do know that any time I've seen it, it's been spelled W, lowercase, lowercase.  They're killing you on Twitter.  So, oh, I know, believe me.  Tell it, it's a Wii, not a Nintendo W2.  I know, I was reading.  But honestly, looking at the fucking commie, it looks like W2. 
[01:35:30]  Kevin from Connecticut is calling Nintendo BS.  Maybe it's something with tax season.  Yes, it's a Nintendo W2.  Very good.  That's what they send you.  They gotta send you your win-loss statement.  Yes.  That's some tax jokes for all you guys out there.  I agree with you that the Wii logo is W, small-eye, small-eye, butt.  You know it from looking at it that it just says Wii with this lowercase.  Like, I'm looking at it right now on Google.  I Googled it, and you could see W, lowercase, lowercase. 
[01:36:00]  And I would never have had a...  I would have flown through it as a Nintendo Wii.  But W2, because it looked like W with a 1-1 in front of it like a 2.  And I thought it was something Brandy knew that I never heard of.  It's funny.  Now, see, I want to say, like, whoever's writing the copy, if they meant to write the  number 2, why wouldn't they just put the number 2?  Oh, please.  The people that write the copy?  Yeah, exactly.  I couldn't say that.  You never know what's going to happen.  We could all be in agreement there. 
[01:36:30]  But if you listened to the read, you would see that I did delay before I said it because  I was trying to process what the fuck that was because I never heard of it.  Maybe it's the next generation.  It might be.  Can we get the read?  I want that part of the read now.  I want to hear it.  You want that?  Yeah, and then we've got to get your Bertation.  It's a day of Bertations.  It really is a day of Bertations.  Dude, Bertation.  Oh, boy.  Where have you been?  When the reporter after the Grammys was?  Oh, yeah.  We're now calling him Bertation.  Bertation.  Because that was the big word in that one. 
[01:37:00]  Bert.  Bertation.  She had no idea.  It's so worth playing again.  Fuck it.  Now they're doing serious interviews where they're like, are you okay?  Who cares?  Serene Branson is live at the Staples Center with highlights and backstage coverage we're  seeing for the very first time.  Serene.  Well, a very, very heavy, heavy Bertation tonight.  We had a very Darrison.  A Darrison, too.  Go ahead, Terry's English for the bet.  They had the pet.  Did that really happen?  I know.  I still don't think that actually happened. 
[01:37:30]  Very, very heavy Bertation.  I had a Bertation when we were interviewing Topher Grace.  My whole body heated up.  You had a Bertation.  I just had a heavy Bertation on the read.  Yours wasn't as bad as mine.  I was watching it happen, too, because it was obvious that you just weren't sure what  your next word was.  I hope you had a Bertation.  You had a Dorsey Dorsey.  All right.  You're going to give Hannah Dorsey Dorsey?  She said Dorsey Dorsey?  I think I had a Dorsey Dorsey.  There's something in there.  Let's hear it again.  Fuck it.  Backstreet is live at the State of the Center.  With highlights and backstage coverage we're seeing for the very first time. 
[01:38:00]  Saree.  Well, a very, very heavy Bertation tonight.  We had a very Darrison.  He had a Darrison.  I had a Darrison, Darrison.  Okay.  Yeah.  A little different than a Bertation.  I had a Darrison, Darrison, too.  I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn't explain myself.  That it's one long, horrible road, and you feel like you're in morning commute for three  or four cities in a row.  But I couldn't say it properly.  Do we have that?  Oh, we have it all, man.  That was, it was really good. 
[01:38:30]  Well, E-Rock's now panicking, because now he was looking for the live read mess up.  The live read mess up.  Oh, okay.  All right, we got Anthony's right now.  Okay, here's my fuck up.  Listen for the delay.  Because I didn't know what I was thinking.  Here are some of the instant, or insane, recent cherry deals.  How about a $25 Apple gift card sold at a cherry auction for 20 cents?  Yep.  A Nintendo W2.  See, I'm like, I don't know what the fuck it is. 
[01:39:00]  That's a Bertation.  Not a Dursy Dursy or whatever.  That's such a Bertation.  We really need clear definitions on what qualifies as a Dursy Durson.  Now I agree with these guys.  No, no, you had a Bertation because your mind fucked up.  I had a Dursy.  A Dursy Durson?  Durson.  I had a Durson because I was reading it, and like I was reading it, I knew that I was reading.  You wanted to say we.  No, no, I didn't. 
[01:39:30]  Really?  It sounded like he wanted to say we, but it looked different.  No, we didn't come into my head.  I saw a W2.  No, because you stopped it after Nintendo.  Because I never heard of a Nintendo W2.  Anthony was going to say Magnavox Odyssey.  It looked like you knew the next word is supposed to be we, but you saw something different on the paper.  No.  No, okay.  The delay was me trying to figure out what the fuck a Nintendo W2 was.  One more time.  Here are some of the instant, or insane, recent cherry deals. 
[01:40:00]  How about a $25 Apple gift card sold at a cherry auction for 20 cents?  Yep.  A Nintendo W2.  See, because I don't know what it is.  What's the next word?  Gaming system, I think.  Bundle.  Yeah, gaming.  A W2 bundle gaming system.  I have no idea what a W2 is.  They're going to ask for their money back. 
[01:40:30]  I'm sorry.  That's horrible.  Beezid.  It's a Wii on Beezid.  Well, tell these idiots if I can spell Wii with the two lowercase eyes.  It's got to be lowercase eyes.  Please.  I mean, come on.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Clearly a Derrison.  That was a Derrison.  Yeah.  You had a Bertation.  Yeah.  Do you have my Bertation?  Yeah.  I really don't feel like he's beating up again.  This is a good one.  Because this was just your mind completely disconnecting from your mouth.  Holy shit.  I hate it.  It's all the same. 
[01:41:00]  There's never not.  I've never once.  Three o'clock in the morning, two o'clock in the afternoon.  It's always stop and go.  When I moved to LA, people were like, how bad is the traveling?  I'm like, not really that bad.  I grew up right on I-95.  There's nothing to compare us to that.  You've got to leave at 10 in the morning so you don't catch the, you know, the, what  is, um, traffic.  Big fan of you guys.  Are you okay?  Do you need a paramedic?  I'm heating up all over again. 
[01:41:30]  That is fantastic.  There was more, right?  No, no.  That was it.  No, no.  That was it.  That was it.  Yeah.  Because after that, you recovered.  No, no.  I got back on track.  I do believe.  You were coming right back into it.  No, that was it.  I think we ought to hear the whole thing again.  No, that was it, I believe.  It's all the same.  There's never not.  I've never once.  Three o'clock in the morning, two o'clock in the afternoon.  It's always stop and go.  When I moved to LA, people were like, how bad is the traveling?  I'm like, not really that bad.  I grew up right on I-95.  There's nothing to compare us to that. 
[01:42:00]  You've got to leave at 10 in the morning so you don't catch the, uh, you know, um, the,  what is, um, traffic.  Big fan of you guys.  Thank you.  Great, great work.  Big fan.  That's exactly what I thought it would be.  I was watching the wheels come off that thought as you had it.  I want to say morning commute, but the afternoon commute even.  No, you have to time it perfectly.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't do the math.  Like, you're a good at math in this.  Okay.  I'm just watching your face and you're like, you have to leave at 10 and I just saw your 
[01:42:30]  eyes open.  I was like, I don't know what the next word is.  Because we used to drive to Boston.  All right.  That's it.  Oh my God.  That is so fucking funny.  In the movie, take me home tonight.  He's really good at numbers.  Oh, okay.  Somehow I was trying to tie that into my horrendous traffic explanation.  Oh my God.  I understand.  Lower case eyes.  It's, it's.  Lower case eyes.  I'm so fucking uncomfortable.  Oh, shit.  And I was going to throw myself under the bus right now, but now I don't think I can handle 
[01:43:00]  it anymore.  I don't know if I can handle it anymore.  I don't know if I can handle it anymore.  Another predation?  Well, it was all right.  It was like, everyone has two thoughts in a row.  Oh my God.  Wow.  That was, that was lost.  Well, yeah, yesterday, man, I'm going to get killed for this one.  My, my wife, she sets up a nice massage for me yesterday. 
[01:43:30]  She goes, a little surprise.  She goes, I got your massage at your gym.  I mean, that's really nice of you.  She goes, it's a tie massage with a female.  I'm thinking this is going to be really nice.  Have you ever had a tie massage?  I have.  Yes.  You wear clothing while they do it and very loose fitting clothing.  One of the, one of the massages you could get.  Yeah.  Suit.  I got a suit of armor.  What do you mean you wear clothes or you're just fucking around?  No, a tie massage is.  Really?  You wear like sweats or even just a boxers or something because it's very, very, you're 
[01:44:00]  on the floor and they stretch you a lot.  So, you know, my, my girl has a pretty good sense of humor.  So I, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what happened.  I don't know if she's fucking with me or it was a legitimate mistake.  Oh, I still don't know.  Cause my tie massage with a young female masseuse, I get there and it's a six foot four black  guy.  I got, I got rubbed down by a six foot four black guy yesterday. 
[01:44:30]  Did it move?  No, it didn't move.  Are you kidding me?  And then I'm like, is she fucking with me and set me up?  Of course she did.  I think she might've.  So wait, she's swearing.  She didn't.  I'll make sure that she's swearing, you know, she's going to call the place.  She's mad.  Cause she specifically asked for a female.  So the massage now with the time massage, did he stretch you a lot?  Cause that's supposed to be where they actually, they, they stretch your legs and your arms.  I was in pain the entire fucking time.  I said, fuck it. 
[01:45:00]  I'm here.  What are you going to do?  Did he massage your wallet out of your back pocket?  Did he massage your hat off with your walker?  Why?  Nothing wrong with that.  Not after my flirtation.  Why?  So it was an hour of this guy basically beating the shit out of me.  It wasn't relaxing at all, but a real massage.  Massages aren't supposed to be that relaxing.  Cause it's supposed to help you after you leave.  And time massages.  Huh?  Hotel.  It's from Seinfeld.  When George got the massage from the guy.  Oh really?  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you pull your, take your pants off so we can get those glutes.  Yeah.  It was so uncomfortable.  Hotel.  Hotel.  He was separating like my muscle from my bone and stuff.  Yeah.  It was so uncomfortable.  You should have told him to go easier.  He told him to be too strong.  But then I'm like, why go easy?  Cause I think it's probably helping me.  So I'm, I might as well go through it.  Yeah.  But I was supposed to have a nice fucking tie type shit.  Big black guy hands on you?  Dude.  He could have been a linebacker.  Fucking huge.  And just ripped.  You were in the massage room? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Were you, were you nude under there?  Yeah.  Oh shit.  How much glute work did he do?  Yeah.  He didn't get too close.  Thank God.  Did he, did he say, I'm finally going to finish what I started in Buffalo, motherfucker?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  What the fuck?  Did you have your, you didn't have your hands positioned on the massage table where your  pinky was hanging off and his turgid black number rubbed against the side of your hand? 
[01:46:30]  Did I do the right thing or should I have left?  Nah, because it's not honestly, and especially a place like in a gym or a spa, he's, it's  not a jerk massage.  It's a real massage.  Dude, I was moaning and yelling the whole time.  It fucking hurt.  One of the best massages I ever got was from a guy years ago was, uh, in that place in  Connecticut.  Did you know it at the time?  Yeah.  It was really weird.  Have you ever had your, your face massaged with balls?  No, it was, uh, in that Connecticut place.  They only had two, one guy and one woman. 
[01:47:00]  So I let my girlfriend have the, the woman and I took the guy and it was, he did like,  it was 90% back and it could be the best massage I ever got.  It's like, as long as I'm not massaging.  You don't want a guy massaging a chick at a, I don't care what, you know, at a spa.  I had one when we were in Vegas recently, there was like, uh, I forget why.  She's like, I'll take him.  I don't care.  And, uh, we get, we're walking down the hall together and mine is like an older woman and  hers like a six foot three guy.  And, um, I mentioned that it was my girlfriend very loudly, but it turns out he was a fan 
[01:47:30]  and he just talked to, I think he was like an Opie and Anthony fan too.  And he just talked about the radio.  She's like, it was so annoying.  He was talking about you and the radio show the whole time.  How relaxing is that?  You don't want them talking.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Just rub something.  Shut up.  Yeah.  It was a black member brushing across the pink head of it, but it was so, it was so what  wasn't set up and what I was expecting.  I can't even find something.  What the fuck?  But you know, it hurt.  Would I have got her massage?  Yeah.  But I would ask him to go easier. 
[01:48:00]  Cause he's probably a guy that does, I got to have bruises on me.  Athletes and stuff like that, but I got to have bruises.  I absolutely would have said, you would have left.  I would have went, no, no, I wouldn't have left, but I wouldn't, uh, sir, uh, you know,  nothing, nothing personal.  I just, I always get massaged by a female.  It's just a comfort thing for me.  I would have allowed the guy to rub you.  No.  Yeah.  No, no.  And I would have said, can I please just have a female masseuse?  Because I, I just always do.  It's more relaxing to me.  I go, to tell you the truth, even get my hair shampooed at the, the salon. 
[01:48:30]  I, uh, I, I gotta have a girl shampoo in my hair.  Why don't you, oh God.  No, so you should look at me and go, look, sir, you're everything that I am, A, angry  at, and B, frightened of.  I would prefer if you don't touch me in a vulnerable position.  As he starts massaging you, you just go, I could have you shot for this.  But then he slips a digit in and you're like, you know what?  I see what all the rave is.  Turned out to be a sports massage, you know, whatever, but I don't know.  No, it's actually probably better you did it because it's homophobic to not do it because 
[01:49:00]  it really, like a sports massage is not sexual.  It's not homophobic.  Oh no, it wasn't even, it wasn't even close to anything.  But it's not homophobic.  It's a thing where it's just more comfortable for, if you're a guy to have a woman, you  don't think about it.  Like when a woman's massaging you, you're not going, you're not thinking, yeah, I'm  going to get laid.  I'm going to do this.  Speak for yourself.  I fuck her.  Right, exactly.  But, but, but when a guy is massaging you, you're not, you're not thinking, oh, he wants  to have sex with me or anything. 
[01:49:30]  You're just thinking it's not as comfortable.  You're conscious that it's a guy doing it and it's just, it's not as comfortable as a  female doing it.  When a doctor touches you, I mean, it's like the same type of thing.  Yeah, that's not comfortable either, but that's a doctor and he's not there to relax.  I was laying there horrified because then they have the nice spa music and then, and then  it's a six foot four black, yeah, the whole thing is to relax, right?  It doesn't seem very relaxing.  It was everything you expect from like a nice massage, but it's a big fucking black 
[01:50:00]  guy.  You should have turned over and just said like, typically doesn't know he's racist white  guy things.  Like, you know what?  You're, you're not like a lot of guys that I've met like you.  I mean, you're as good as I am as a person.  I'd let you into my neighborhood and house.  Did you learn this in prison?  It's that awful thing.  What sports do you play?  When you dropped out of high school, did you continue with athletics?  Now watch when you get down to the lower back.  I don't have that extra muscle that you guys have. 
[01:50:30]  Take that black people.  I, I, I, I did feel like he was making her just a little, a little more because I'm white  and he's black.  Taking it out.  I had a weird feeling.  Of course he was.  Years of oppression.  I had a little bit of a feeling that, uh, yeah, he wasn't holding back.  He's probably, he probably watched X right before he got there.  Oh God.  And you're just thinking of Malcolm's beautiful smile and you fucking rotten devil.  Hey, you've ruined the world.  Freaking, freaking this guy too bad.  He doesn't have a name.  Cause it's great. 
[01:51:00]  He writes, uh, I hope Opie didn't wear the sweats, the capital letters, sweats.  I, no, I didn't wear the sweats.  I only wear that to yoga class when the lady gets behind me.  And I know it's just really just not a good place for her to be.  You should ask them to take it easy though.  Do you, you can always say like, I didn't know what to do.  Cause then I'm thinking it's going to be a waste of time if I tell him to take it easy.  Cause these guys are trained and I'm figuring, uh, I do a lot of working out and my muscles  needed to be put back in their proper place.  So did his. 
[01:51:30]  So I'm like, I don't know if, I don't think you'd get what, you know, what you could get  from one of those.  If, if you tell him, take it easy.  I asked.  It was fucking painful.  Dude, just imagine you're like, there's no, there's no muscle or skin really on the shin  bone.  Yeah.  And he's digging.  Ow.  You know that feeling where he's just digging right on the bone?  Yeah.  It fucking hurt.  Why massage that?  I would have asked for less.  I got a massage when I was away in Portland and the woman was, uh, she was like,  she was like six foot.  She was a big girl, but not fat, just tall and strong. 
[01:52:00]  I had to keep going.  Ah, a little lower, a little lighter.  I'll tell anybody fucking longer.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Hey, what are you doing?  Eric from Virginia tech.  Hey, Oh, what makes you think he wasn't disappointed?  He was hoping for a white chick too.  Probably.  Yeah, probably.  Where the white women at?  You're probably right.  But I was just thinking about myself.  Fuck what he's thinking.  A massage from a Negro.  A big girl.  Was he as big as Wendy Williams?  Uh, yes.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  We saw Wendy Williams.  She's a big girl.  Damn.  Kind of sexy.  That bikini video that she made.  I don't disagree.  Kind of sexy.  I think she is sexy.  I hate to say that because we beat her up a little bit, but that video about a month  ago of her getting out of the pool in a tiny bikini.  Holy shit.  She would break your dick.  She is?  She's on the new season of Dance with the Stars.  They got Wendy Williams too?  Yeah, they announced it.  Yes, sure.  I know they got Chris Jericho and he doesn't announce it on our show.  Thanks, Chris.  Really appreciate it.  Could one friend of the fucking show would like do a big announcement for us? 
[01:53:00]  Anytime they do that, they probably told, look, we're not putting the press release  out yet, so don't say anything.  Yeah, they did a whole like special, like on TV announcing it.  Yeah, they're not going to fucking blurt it out here.  You're probably not allowed to.  I mean, contractually, they'd probably make you promise not to.  Yeah.  Good news.  We got other guys that were massaged by big black guys.  AJ in Dayton, Ohio.  I don't know. 
[01:53:30]  Reginald Denny.  Got a face massage.  Of course he did.  With a toilet bowl.  Yo, you want a Thai massage?  I'll use the sink, motherfucker.  Yo, you got some knots.  Give me that brick.  I'll get them knots out.  He does a little dance.  I love his little dance after he clobbers them with the brick.  Yeah, he does a little dance.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what kind of dance it was.  It could have been.  Irish.  I'm seconds away from turning off my Twitter.  Still smoking, writes, to the large, unruly stretcher asshole. 
[01:54:00]  He's got to work the sphincter muscle.  Yeah.  What's wrong with those rough hands?  That one really hurts.  Smelled like cocoa butter because he lotioned his hands before he came in.  What do we got?  Where are we at?  Oh, yeah.  AJ, go ahead.  Good evening, gentlemen.  Hey, brother.  Hey, I had this kind of the same situation happen.  My wife and I were on vacation down in Naples, Florida, and she had this, it was some kind  of, you know, when something at work or whatever.  Oh.  Options you could do.  So she chose a massage. 
[01:54:30]  Well, we're sitting in the waiting room, and her chick comes out, and she's like, oh,  okay, give me five minutes, and I'll be with you.  And I'm like, oh, okay, now it's going to be my turn next.  So then the dude comes out, this big, black, you look like Ving Reigns.  Ving Reigns.  And he's like, Jason, I'm going to be ready for you in five minutes.  So anyway, it turned out, I think that, I mean, that was my first massage, so I don't 
[01:55:00]  know, but I think it probably was better because the dude's hands were like fucking, you know,  softball mitts.  It was crazy.  Yeah, I'm not going to lie.  It was a good little chick.  It was a good little Asian chick is working her little bony fingers on me.  I don't know if that would be as good.  They're good, too, though.  The Asian women are very good.  I wanted to say.  They use their feet, though, right?  Huh?  No, they use their feet.  They like stand on you and shit with the Asian chicks.  Depends where you go.  Yeah, they have all sorts of types.  This guy was digging into my fucking feet.  It hurts so fucking much. 
[01:55:30]  Was it Tony Rocky Hara?  Give you a foot massage?  I wanted to say to the people.  Separate any muscle from bones or anything like that on me, but, you know, I think it  was a good situation, but I'm punching out, boys.  All right.  All right.  I wanted to say, could you at least give me the fat chick?  I'll take the fat chick.  True.  Yeah, fat chick over the black guy.  I'll take the fat chick.  Someone's got to take the fat chick.  I'll have the fat chick.  I would be so uncomfortable laying there and having a big black guy massaging me.  Uh, no.  I'm not going to lie to you. 
[01:56:00]  It was uncomfortable.  I would be very uncomfortable.  I tried to go to a deeper place.  Did you?  Yeah, I really tried.  Was your massage okay?  No, man.  It was pretty fucking far from okay.  He just wanted to help stretch those muscles and get medieval in your ass.  And massage you with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  Yeah, here's the music that was playing.  Here's, let me put in your ball gag. 
[01:56:30]  Work those, knead out those glutes.  Did you notice, like, when he had an elbow by the glutes, that his breath was, like, brushing along the ass hairs?  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy just goes, yeah.  I'd be up on my elbows with my iPhone looking at my favorite website.  See if he looks in and sees, you know, something mania.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mike at Hoboken. 
[01:57:00]  Mikey, keep the music on.  I was in Belize on my honeymoon, and I had actually, like, thrown my back out on this trip to the Mayan ruins.  And on the way back, the tour company made a stop at this resort, and it's actually where they filmed Temptation Island.  So I thought I'd get a massage to work out my back.  And they put me in this little sweat room, and after I'm in there, I have my bathing shorts on.  And then the little, he must have been 4'5", Mexican dude with a mullet.  He just comes in the room, and he's like, please, sir, remove shorts. 
[01:57:30]  Remove your shorts, please.  And after, like, I made him get out before I took my shorts off, and he starts massaging me.  He tried to massage my ass.  He tried to give me a reach around and get up and leave the place.  I was like, I'm done, dude.  Get the fuck out of here.  Give me a rusty trombone.  I love that you threw out your back coming back from the Mayan ruins.  The Mayan ruins.  That's a great visual.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to the Middle East, or TJ was in the Middle East. 
[01:58:00]  TJ, Jersey.  Morning, boys.  I was on the Middle East on a two-year deployment with the Navy, played rugby out there,  and the only way to get a proper massage out in town due to the local laws is it has to be guy-on-guy, girl-on-girl.  So I went to a nice hotel to get a massage, and this big Russian dude, like friggin' Drago from Rocky IV, comes out and fuckin' broke me.  And at one point during the massage, like, Enyu's playing in the background, and the candles are lit, and I felt him sweat, like, and it dropped on the small of my back.  That would fuckin' creep me out. 
[01:58:30]  Ah.  That's, yeah, no good, man.  And that was it, and I kind of said thanks, and see you later.  But I think the best masseuses are gonna be this weekend, it's Saturday, at the Wellmont Theater in Montclair, seeing Jimmy Norton.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  An excellent plug.  That was very good.  I'm not even gonna mention my CD coming out next week. It's not important.  Oh, that's exciting.  Yeah, it comes out the 7th.  Ooh.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Bye!  Very good CD, by the way. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  Finally tracked through it.  Oh, did you hear it? Okay.  And you're not even gonna mention it?  I'm a very bad plugger.  Oh.  Wow.  I'm a very bad plugger.  You guys wanna play Charlie Sheen or the Ultimate Warrior?  Enough of the laughing baby.  Wow.  Wow, that's adorable.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I'll tell you, if you wanna stop him laughing, it ain't hard.  Really?  Yeah.  You can start him crying real fast?  Yeah, they sound the same almost. 
[01:59:30]  Tickle, tickle.  You give him turkey foot and he laughs.  Oh, I hate turkey foot.  You do.  When you put the foot in your mouth, you make turkey noises.  Oh, and his feet just smell like fucking old bad breath and cigarettes.  Yeah, smell like cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  You know how you have those awful things that you think, like those words that are stuck in  your head?  Yeah.  I don't know why I thought of this one.  I think my mom said it when I was like, oh, no, what is it? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, no.  When I would fart, I think she said, someone said someone made a bubble when I was a kid.  I, like, someone made a bubble, but I'll actually think that.  I never realized I think that, but not in that.  It's a really weird way that I think it.  When do you think it?  No, when I fart.  Like, not always, once in a while, the thought will, I don't say it, but it just hits my  head.  It comes into my head, and I think it's from my mom.  But I'll think, like, someone made a bubble. 
[02:00:30]  Why do you think it that way?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I don't know.  A bubble?  No, someone made a bubble.  I don't know why that creeps into my head.  That is really awful.  It's fucking horrendous.  Someone made a bubble.  A bubble.  Someone made a bubble.  And I don't know why, any more than I know where Minuzzo comes from. 
[02:01:00]  Minuzzo.  Minuzzo.  Minuzzo.  Couple of Minuzzo.  Couple of Minuzzo.  I forgot about Minuzzo.  Fuck.  You're a weirdo.  I do.  Those things are creeping into your head, and you don't know where they started.  Yeah.  I thought that this morning, though, when I farted.  I was like, ugh.  It's probably some old priest.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why do I think the Apostles' Creed while I'm farting?  My asshole hurts.  You want to try this Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior?  Certainly.  Yeah.  How does this work?  Can I give myself credit for something? 
[02:01:30]  I didn't know this.  I said that guy Dan Fogler had a Kinnison-esque scream.  I had no idea.  Somebody said that he's playing Kinnison in an HBO documentary.  No kidding.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  That was just a...  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy's going to be really big.  He's very good.  He was the standout in the movie, certainly.  Yeah.  Take me home tonight.  Just had Topher Grayson here today.  He was definitely very cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And a new friend, I think.  I think we made a new friend today.  He was very cool.  I wasn't expecting that, to tell you the truth. 
[02:02:00]  All right, here we go.  Is this Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior?  I will...  How are we going to do this?  Just read it.  Have a rock read them, or somebody read them.  Yeah, let's have somebody else read it.  Well, Eric can read them after we find out which The Ultimate Warrior is.  He can always read them in his Ultimate Warrior impression.  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  I like that a lot.  And who could do Charlie Sheen?  Eric?  Roland.  Roland is great at Charlie Sheen.  Dead on.  Where's Roland? 
[02:02:30]  So, you know what?  I'm going to give Danny the answers, and I'm going to go around the board while Eric comes  in here to do his Ultimate Warrior impression.  Should all the guys be in there?  Because then you could point to who has to say the line.  You know what I mean?  Should all the guys be in here?  Or in there.  If you guys are all together, that's easy, too.  In there?  What do you think?  Yeah, just everyone go in there.  Or is it too small in there?  Yeah.  Then everyone come in here.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, let's do that.  Your excitement is mounting.  You want to see Eric when he gets into character, right? 
[02:03:00]  Yes, yes.  By the way, for the people listening, this is such a throwaway bit.  No, it's going to be good.  All right, where's Roland?  Should we take a break so we can get Roland here and set this up properly?  Sure.  No, we could play the break.  The terrific Troy Kwan song.  Oh, man.  Or we could play the Charlie Sheen cocaine PSA.  What's happening today?  What's happening today? 
[02:03:30]  Bertations.  There's Bertations all over the place.  All right, we'll get rolling.  No, I was reading.  Somebody said somebody did Charlie Sheen or Macho Man Randy Savage.  Really?  Yesterday.  Who did?  Toucher and Rich.  Oh, very good.  We didn't know that.  Yeah.  We're doing Ultimate Warrior.  Bitstealers.  I didn't know none of us did it.  It's the same guy, though, that's saying that.  Oh, shit.  We're bitstealers.  Bitstealers?  Yeah.  Fuck.  How about fucking, how about you're bounced? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, shit.  How about I bounce you right out of here?  Huh?  That's not nice, Ant.  I know.  We'll play Charlie Sheen or the Ultimate Warrior after the break, but first this.  Every year, thousands of people die of cocaine use.  We call those people losers.  Actor Charlie Sheen knows all about the positive effects cocaine can have on your life.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning, you know, and just winning every  second.  Cocaine can put you in touch with your emotions. 
[02:04:30]  My motto now is you either love or you hate, and you must do so violently.  I don't live in the middle anymore.  That's where you get slaughtered.  That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.  Think you need AA?  Nah.  Cocaine will make you sharp enough to fix it yourself.  Debate me on AA right now.  I have a disease.  Bullshit.  I cured it.  With my brain.  With my mind.  I'm cured.  I'm done.  There it is.  Cocaine will improve your spelling tenfold.  S-H-I-T.  You may even meet your soulmate.  I'm gonna hang out with these two smoking hotties and fly privately around the world. 
[02:05:00]  You know, I might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view.  So try cocaine today.  Hey, Thomas Jefferson did it.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson.  He was a pussy.  Um, thanks, Charlie.  Pure and complete gnarly-isms.  Losers winning.  Bye-bye.  This is the Open Entry Show.  Open Entry.  Open Entry.  All the files.  Sirius XM.  It's the God's Honest Truth. 
[02:05:30]  All right, we're gonna play, uh, Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior in a few minutes.  Yes.  We don't really have the audio of, uh...  Which is a shame.  What happened?  Kenny just barged in.  Kenny just barged in and looked with this face that was just blank and stark and then  walked back out.  Looking for Jimmy?  I think so.  Jimmy will be back in a few minutes.  Jimmy had to go wee-wees, I think.  A little wee-wee happening. 
[02:06:00]  Wee-wees.  So we're gonna have E-Rock play The Ultimate Warrior, and we're gonna have Roland play  Charlie Sheen.  Actual quotes we're gonna read here, and then we gotta figure it out, and you can play along  at home.  Who said it?  Because they're both, you know, kind of crazy.  Right.  And then, uh, E-Rock will certainly do his, uh, great Ultimate Warrior impression.  Oh, yeah.  And Roland does a fucking spot-on Charlie Sheen.  Wait till you hear this.  Yeah, it's exactly like him.  He's fooled people on the phone before with that impression.  Yes.  Yes, he has.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, and we can set up the whole bit with the Troy Kwan song, which is just terrific. 
[02:06:30]  Yes!  I mean, this is a perfect bit.  Yeah.  Forming in front of our eyes.  I got all scared that you weren't gonna play it when you didn't play it.  Oh, no, I love the break.  How do you not play the Troy Kwan song?  We want listeners, right?  I mean...  That's right, we do.  Where's Troy?  You gotta get him in here, right?  Oh, God.  I wanna give him some more accolades on his fine song.  It's like the same way Alex Jones was psyched that he had Charlie Sheen on his show.  Yes.  We're psyched that we, like, a lot of news places might be like, oh, the Charlie  Machine story is hot, but you gotta hear this song. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  Troy, I gotta tell you.  You're feeling it, right?  The song is fucking terrific.  It took a little while, right?  I just wanted to compliment you once again.  It grows on you.  It really does.  Thanks, dude.  What do you want to say to Troy about the song, Ed?  It's, uh...  It's a song.  Is it?  Yeah, it's like...  I don't...  I'm not even sure if it really is, though.  Yeah.  It sounds like a number one hit tune.  Hit tune.  Right?  That's a little something for you.  Exactly.  That's great.  That sounds like a number one hit tune. 
[02:07:30]  The only thing that concerns me is that Jim is also...  He told me that he loves this song, and I...  Oh, good.  He's back.  Jim, you're back just in time for the Troy Kwan song.  Oh, good.  And I know you're a big fan.  See, see, see.  What do you want to tell Troy about his song?  He's right behind you there.  It was good.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  He knows how I feel about it.  Yeah, yeah.  It was funny.  We got...  You know, it was good.  Rhythmic.  Rhythmic.  What was the inspiration?  I just love Charlie Sheen.  This is great.  Everyone does.  So what went into making this? 
[02:08:00]  Well, I was working on the PSA that you played earlier on Sunday night, and there was a lot  of clips.  A lot of clips.  There was such a wealth of material that I didn't want to let it go to waste.  Yes.  And I had put something together, and I'd just kind of thrown it together, and I played  it for Sam yesterday, and I'm like, you know, should I turn this in?  He's like, yeah, go ahead.  Turn it in.  So I did.  Why would you ask Sam?  You went to Sam.  Anyone but Sam.  Sam has been a pretty good judgment of like, hey, nah, maybe you should tweak this a little  bit.  But he was like, no, it's great.  Turn it in. 
[02:08:30]  Now, Sam, what were you thinking when you first heard this?  I was thinking this is a song that's going to make for a good segment on the radio.  A good segment on the radio.  I don't understand what the problem is.  Like, it's just, it's a song, you know, you discuss it afterwards, you know, you could  have a, it definitely, it gives you an opinion.  It's not something that you're left going, you know, what was that?  It's like, okay, I have an opinion on this, and let's go with this.  That just makes for good talk radio.  You know what I like?  The best part of it, honestly, is that you can hear every clip. 
[02:09:00]  Because you're not like, you're not like laughing and getting all in the way.  You've got complete focus.  Yeah, yeah.  Because sometimes, like, you laugh and you miss some of the words, and you've got to  listen again.  I feel like when we did the We Are The World song, some of the stuff was missed, because  like, you guys were like, oh, that's really good.  And while you were saying that, there was another line.  Yeah, yeah.  And so in this song, I mean, you would never say that, so you'd hear everything.  The studio falls, like, deathly silent. 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  My favorite part is when it ends.  You like that part?  Why?  Because it gives you a chance to discuss it?  Reflect and discuss.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Sam.  Yes.  See, I'm having birktations today, so I'm glad you're here to explain what I mean.  The cool thing is, though, it was like, in a situation like this where everybody's making  fun of things and laughing, it was really cool to have, like, a dramatic piece made.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, something that was serious.  Well, before you, Troy, was that, was it intended to be dramatic? 
[02:10:00]  It's open for interpretation.  I mean, take it however you want, really.  Open for interpretation.  Yes.  True.  I like, too, that there are people who haven't heard it yet, and like, yesterday, you just  put it on cold, because I didn't told you anything about it, and today it's got more  of an introduction.  Yeah.  People are kind of like, oh, I gotta hear this now.  And it sets up the big bit, Charlie Sheen or The Ultimate Warrior.  Right.  Well, this is like the theme song to the bit.  Yes, it is.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm an F-18, bro.  That's right.  Without further ado, here's Troy Kwan's Charlie Sheen thing. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, what is it called?  I'm an F-18, bro.  Is it a song?  Is it a comedic piece?  What was the thing he said about college radio before we were up the air?  Oh, boy, is he hanging you up the door.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  I don't remember what it was.  He said what?  I didn't say that.  Oh, he said something about college radio.  No, no, no, no, I didn't say that.  I forget exactly.  I didn't say that.  I forget the quote entirely.  Something about this song on college radio I don't remember.  What I was thinking, Sam, was I could have used this piece when I was getting massaged 
[02:11:00]  yesterday.  Oh.  Oh, and you just, you know, because you want to relax.  Okay.  Maybe sleep a little bit.  Oh, I got it.  Nothing that will get you tense and laughing.  yeah yeah okay oh it just sounded like it might have been handed in by someone in college radio  oh no i didn't say that sam what are you talking about like i said i mean i leave it open to sam  to be the filter he's he's so funny such a funny guy that uh he can really sort of uh uh say hey 
[02:11:30]  this is great for the radio or maybe you should hold on to this but he said it was go and and uh  that's that's what we did and i mean i day two of discussing it i still have yet to be proven wrong  i guess it's yeah makes for great radio we're talking about it exactly what category though  it's it's a song or is it a music piece i just wanted to uh i was just fucking around with  something that i had and i used you just thought it was interesting that there was all these charlie  sheen clips exactly that's all i love charlie couldn't get enough of them you're like you're 
[02:12:00]  like radiohead you like to confuse everybody yeah it's like charlie sheen was talking and there was  no music under it and so did you make the music huh did you make the music no i just need to pay  yeah okay wow hence the college radio uh yeah oh geez well i used to slap things together too man i  mean i think he took a little more effort into yeah yeah i was open flying this was kind of like a  college radio like he just threw it together like somebody who's just kind of learning doesn't 
[02:12:30]  really know at all what he's doing sam well that's right because college radio is not i mean  nobody knows oh i thought you meant like when someone handed it in from college radio that was  like an intern that went from the professional in the recording studio and he said hey take this to  the studio and then the intern college guy brought it to you because the guy in the production studio  is so busy making good stuff he can't possibly run it over himself what opie was saying and this  isn't me i don't know but what opie was saying was that the person who made it is the one who's 
[02:13:00]  in college radio that they don't know what they're doing yet at all like they have no clue they've  never done anything like this before so it wouldn't choice handed in some fine pieces so far like this  one well everything can't be a banger you know what i mean this is an album cut it's not a single  yeah i mean you know like we were talking about the beatles yesterday did revolution nine you know  i mean it's not their finest work but it's still comparing it's a piece of their catalog you know  so you're comparing it to the beatles that's fair revolution nine yes revolution nine okay 
[02:13:30]  so it's fair like not it's not it's not let it be all right it's as good as the beatles all right  yeah yeah everyone's screaming just fucking play it everybody's ready everybody's excited  this is what we were looking for building anticipation that's right what is this called  i'm an f-18 bro you know they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children  and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and they say i can't process it well 
[02:14:00]  no and you never will stop trying just sit back and enjoy the show i'm an f-18 bro just sit back and  enjoy the show i'm an f-18 bro enjoy the show newsflash i am special and i will never be one of  you this is me not on drugs bro i will destroy you in the air and i will i will i will deploy my  awareness to the ground the only thing i'm addicted to right now is winning you know the first one's  free the next one goes in your mouth just sit back and enjoy the show i'm an f-18 bro just sit back 
[02:14:30]  and enjoy the show i'm an f-18 bro just sit back and enjoy the show wait can't process it losers  winning i'm an f-18 bro goodbye  fuck yeah  i'm an f-18 bro you don't enjoy the show and f-18 bro rhyme 
[02:15:00]  i don't know if you guys picked up on it but where did that music like why did you choose that music  well like i said i was working on the psa that you guys played earlier and i had pulled that bed  for something else and i was like oh i didn't use these pieces let's just use these and have some  fun with it that's all so what happened to the fun part no i mean that's where some of the higher up  producers should probably you know filter it out oh i mean i know daniel's gonna take that as an 
[02:15:30]  insult but i only played it for sam so no i mean that's true i mean you said higher up producers  he did say that well he's a producer i'm not a producer i'm not the producer level i only played  it for him so how is that how would that be your problem i i think you know fair question no he's  right and i mean i i just i didn't know but maybe i was confused about what he was asking he said would  this be good on the air and i've enjoyed both today and yesterday's segments on it yeah so i would  say it's good on the air good good dan do you feel like he's blaming like you guys yeah no i think 
[02:16:00]  sam did his job absolutely 100 correctly yeah he did yeah boy did he fucking set you up that's right  no i didn't because it's also it's not fair that troy stuck on the phones he doesn't let his voice  doesn't get to be heard and this is you know what do you mean i mean what because you said thank god  because he does such a good job on the phone oh yeah he does a good job on the phone  my mic was on why wouldn't it be wrong there you got the button right in front of you 
[02:16:30]  you didn't turn it off i'm walking on sunshine  because i like the patrice songs troy does his thing so i figured this is a nice  all right are we ready for uh charlie sheen or the ultimate warrior thank you troy kwan  troy kwan there he goes now doing beatles stuff for the radio show revolution he said it's as good  as the beatles yeah exactly where did that music come from it was a nice juxtaposition it almost 
[02:17:00]  sounded like a sideways version of the star wars cantina music yeah that you know like a sideways  version of it can we uh lift the clip where he says uh just sit back and enjoy the show and  and throw it on our intro my goal is to have a four hour intro  you mean just tack it on to the intro yeah just slowly but surely just keep pasting shit on man  that'd be perfect can you guys squeeze that in i don't see why not and the affected version that he  just he has here uh-huh just sit back and enjoy the show that could that could maybe be right before 
[02:17:30]  uh enough of the palaver or should we do enough of the palaver than that no enough of this palaver  it's got to be the last last thing all right right before enough of the palaver but i'll say this  good thing i brought that to the show and let me know how long the intro is up to right now  it's got to be three minutes at least whatever it is it's not nearly long enough all right good  let's just keep pasting on to it with ecstasy or without  at what time do we start to get shut up  it's great all right now eric's gonna let us know all right with ecstasy that's fair 
[02:18:00]  and the worst of no no no no that's great with ecstasy the current intro we are at  five minutes and six seconds that's the intro of the show that's nothing all right and now we're  gonna add this little clip it should be at least seven i'm thinking really should that would round  it out yeah nice even number nice even 10 would be i mean percentage wise what if we just yeah  what if we just what if we just added troy's song in its entirety to the intro just the uh sit back 
[02:18:30]  and enjoy the show and then enough of this palaver and then we start the show but it seems like no  wait hold on if we do that though there's a lot of uh shut up jimmy okay i'm just saying there's a lot  of show that we're just not doing we're just playing oh look at that the w1 governor is revealing  a two-year plan to uh it's wisconsin that's w-i what it's wisconsin it's the abbreviation oh i 
[02:19:00]  thought it said w1 governor it's an i oh my mistake sorry so i'm gonna say we don't even do palaver  since the the the stacy keach thing started really well that's another addition so now we got to add  the palaver's got to go back because that's a staple and then we got to add the charlie sheen thing  because that's a new state we should put bertation in there and we should probably put bertation  somehow yeah all right well work i i like that you're uh admitting that you don't listen to the  intro of the show since you're just finding out that we're too busy talking there have honestly 
[02:19:30]  been times we couldn't answer that question we're too busy preparing there have honestly been times  where we've been sitting here talking and oh he goes oh shit hits the button and like the music is  playing rage is playing shows on time to fucking do the show we run a tight ship around yeah yeah  right more like a ship that's in the ocean said ship  we're stalling because where's roland he's got to play charlie sheen is he back there yet 
[02:20:00]  i don't know i thought we found him no i'll tell you where i hope roland is  somehow clutching his chest on the floor hoping someone sees him here comes roland oh no  roland roland roland there he is he was such a skinny boy he's he's juicing he's lost weight  he was over last night uh juicing juicing and he got to see my kids spit up on me 
[02:20:30]  oh no really roland how great was the kid last night spit up on him  uh he was fussy yeah fussy it took us two and a half was your kid fussy he really was fussy last  night he was a pain in the ass quite frankly and i told anthony and got to say this carefully but  you kind of understand when uh parents shake their kids i would never do that i wouldn't do it i would  never but i understand it's it's kind of the chris rock oj thing yeah i understand you kind of 
[02:21:00]  understand you lose your mind like just shaking a baby a bit fussy last night right yeah then when he's  quiet he climbs everywhere really he leans up against the the windows and i'm i'm about four  to five hundred feet up in the sky that's all right i'm hoping the windows are in place nice  oh jesus yeah yeah you should check that out no kidding but i gave him a spoonful of food and at  that moment he decided he needed to sneeze it went fucking everywhere that's hilarious  okay i thought he's like spit up like like puked on you no he doesn't he doesn't puke 
[02:21:30]  as much he sneezed with a mouthful of food it went fucking everywhere why did he cover his mouth  oh he's almost 10 months old that is a panicky moment when you're eating something and you just  put something in your mouth and you realize oh my god i'm gonna sneeze and there's that race  to to get the food down your gullet before you sneeze it all over the place or to get something you  could sneeze into at least yeah because it's just a wreck and then take me home tonight  took us two and a half hours to watch it's an hour and a half movie this is what you got to deal 
[02:22:00]  with as a parent you got to keep pausing this is stuff the parents out there can relate to did  you like that pausing did you like stopping the movie it's the greatest birth control i've seen in  my life i'm like oh my god i never want to do this i'm like you sure you don't want one of these  you have to pause and they hold it and then and then you're just looking at the paused screen like  god fuck and then not only that i'm like roland i i didn't even listen the last five minutes can we  go back oh no roland's never coming over again when the movie's playing have to be quiet because 
[02:22:30]  now it's not moving or if you lift your head the kid turns his head oh really you gotta hide from  the child so you can watch the movie and we should invite jimmy i didn't know you were gonna watch the  movie last night oh that's i was i should have fucking called you at least oh no i knew why no because  we knew you were interviewing uh lemmy or was that earlier in the day we did lemmy earlier we  didn't know it was gonna be earlier until yesterday yeah because i saw that you tweeted  a picture as you were interviewing him but i love him all right hey yeah you're gonna play

[02:35:00]  more yeah i need a tiebreaker we're in sudden death all right all right this one should be easy we  should have a clear-cut winner okay all right what you mean is that you will never know wait i'm  sorry let me start again please to be clear what you mean is that you know  will never become famous but in your dreams when you fantasize that you might one day you would want  to have the confidence and belief in the staying power and value of a of your product like i do mine 
[02:35:30]  well i i think i think i actually i heard that on that uh tmz interview so jimmy it's to you though  i'm not gonna say anything about i'll go with charlie  both of you guys are going charlie sheen yeah okay yeah let's do that yeah it's obviously charlie  oh it's war survivor series 89 oh my god  you're still all tied up damn it 
[02:36:00]  what you mean is that you never will what you mean is that you know will never become famous  but in your dreams when you fantasize that you might one day you would want to have the confidence  and belief in the staying power and value of product like i do mine 
[02:36:30]  all right i remember when warrior did that wow what was that where it was actually survivor  series 89. that doesn't sound right no i just watched it actually the other night so i remember  the promo very well i take his word for it anyone have a suggestion how we end this thing i said  we have a tie no no no you can't because the the listeners will be all pissed off we gotta keep going  until we get we'll get it probably yes all right all right next one i'm gonna hang on to them and  they're gonna fuel my attack and they're gonna fuel my the battle cry of my deadly and dangerous 
[02:37:00]  and secret and silent soldiers because they're all around you wow that that's a trick that's a  tough one ah that's from tmz you think so yeah that sounds exactly like the backyard interview with  tmz i agree so you're both saying charlie sheen yep yeah that sounds like charlie i mean i don't  want to lose this game it's charlie sheen no it's not oh my god it's warrior it is warrior i'm gonna 
[02:37:30]  hang on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack and they're going to fuel the battle cry of my  deadly and dangerous and secret and silent soldiers because they're all around you  he actually said that right before defeating the honky tonk man that's correct when you're  a honky tonk man that's around 1989 it was for the intercontinental title yeah it was a big year  for the ultimate warrior huge huge huge yeah i remember that i mean it's a very famous promo 
[02:38:00]  i remember it as a matter of fact you do now that your soup's done any suggestions yeah i know  i figured i'd let you two duke it out while i ate my soup any suggestions huh we're in a tie uh here  and roland is so ready to do his charlie sheen impression he sure is he's whenever there's  a charlie sheen quote fuck ah how do we how do we handle this i think you got to do one more clip  jimmy i don't disagree you're up for one more sure it's getting tight we're running out of clips uh  travis uh no we got a few more i i really think we'll get a winner before you know this is over 
[02:38:30]  yeah that is fine let me see that first go to hell i was drinking water over there he's trying to  should we combine two clips to make it more obvious maybe or if there's two clips by the  same person yeah yeah do that yeah sure i could do that clips um okay ready sure clearly i have  defeated this earthworm with my words imagine what i would have done with my fire breathing fists  i am i embarrassed him in front of his children in the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind 
[02:39:00]  can't process oh boy shit i think that's ultimate warrior i don't disagree i thought that what what  part i mean healing talking about healing yeah healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot  process and charlie sheen's always saying shit about how you know right you're lower your mind  isn't as good as his and you know yeah but why would travis make it so obvious i'm going ultimate 
[02:39:30]  warrior final answer that way final answer jimmy i i agree alternate warrior wow okay uh  you're ready ah warrior clearly i've defeated this earthworm with my words imagine what i would have  done with my fire breathing fists i embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a  pace that his unevolved mind cannot process why why are you calling it in why is erot calling 
[02:40:00]  i don't know at the end he really does you don't really care about the show i mean that was the  ultimate warriors famous promo returning at wrestlemania 8 obviously after an injury right what year that  was uh 92 92 yeah 92 and uh yeah you're not really giving it your all i hear you you yell at a couple of  little points but but then you go down a little too low for too long do you want to be here that's  what he does you want really here do you want to be here it doesn't sound like you want to be here 
[02:40:30]  yeah i can leave where's the passion where's the passion i know i mean really uh how we end this at  you know what's this is it still a tie game yes it's a tie oh wow okay i know how to end it but uh  it doesn't adhere to the use of deadly physical force laws that are in place um  should we combine two more again maybe make it a little easier it's a great idea actually why are 
[02:41:00]  you coughing i love you okay unrelated it goes unrelated unrelated what do you have tuberculosis  i'm sick oh yeah yeah a little bit what's wrong i don't know i got a cough stomach virus oh boy has  that uh the worst i was gonna say has that curtailed your eating actually yes because i like when i get  the flu it's like i call it the flu diet you don't want to eat anything really it was uh for the last  four days put it down oh my god listen to his voice last four days it was pretty much liquid except 
[02:41:30]  sunday when i tried to eat regular food and it just uh it just flew out like bosco it was just  oh you puked it right up really uh first two days it was puking the rest just what is non-stop diarrhea  it doesn't stop voice is scratchy yeah how'd you get a short throat from a stomach virus no that was  from this oh the cough is unrelated what are you down to five thousand calories a day oh geez it's a lot of 
[02:42:00]  liquid let's do it we have to be leery here of eroc's voice let's be careful what are we doing  travis uh i'm gonna combine two more because i really think that this will be the way that we  get a winner and that's a two-pointer too right yeah okay yeah so it'll be an undisputed one  how many points this could be a thousand eight hundred and forty one pointer it's irrelevant  or half point okay okay if you love with violence and you hate with violence there's nothing that can 
[02:42:30]  be questioned you can kill me but you do not have the right to judge me i have closed my eyes and in  a nanosecond i cured myself yeah that one you made it you made it pretty easy it's charlie sheen  you made it pretty easy that time wait did you just have a thought it's charlie sheen yep  you both think it's charlie sheen yeah yeah i do if i was still playing i would say it too  because i just heard that it's a two-pointer so it's pretty much 
[02:43:00]  no oh that was a warrior are you serious that was the warrior if you love with violence and you  hate with violence you gotta start over yeah if you love with violence and you hate with violence  there's nothing that can be questioned you can kill me but you do not have the right to judge me  i have closed my eyes and in a nanosecond i cured myself 
[02:43:30]  again back from an injury that is a promo from saturday night's main event in 1988 he was fighting  ted deviasi ted deviasi ted the hitman no the million dollar man who's the hitman that's brett  the hitman heart it was the million dollar man right and he had a the manager what was his name  virgil virgil who you did a signing yes and nobody alone at the table and no one showed up damn it  go with the wild card what do you what's the wild card um if the virus would do one punchline i 
[02:44:00]  think we could all agree we can move on well that way the virus would be the winner right because  and the audience is the loser obviously that's happened already obviously we're stuck in a tie  here yep yep we're too good you guys are too good too good for this game would you uh agree to do one  fucking punchline virus you want to be stuck without a punchline too yeah oh my god listen to that  yeah you ever get that voice you ever get that voice where it's like this hi i'm brenda vicaro 
[02:44:30]  there's so much going on in the news though with charlie sheen it's it's like a cornucopia of  punchlines yes exactly virus all the late say that again cornucopia cornucopia yeah what do you  say how do you say it i don't know cornucopia it's a cornucopia i would never attempt that word  not cornucopia no one says it like that i think so yeah we'll take a survey you also put an h in  costume costume it's because of the you and the i mean it's not about me right now you say 
[02:45:00]  cornucopia biak biak piak backpack my biak piak biak piak cornucopia cornucopia are we doing the  virus today or no i think we should we're not he's here bring him in he's good yeah could you  rock you could get out of here before the virus yeah could you go get the virus seriously i think  tank hankerous should intro the virus that's a great idea yeah could you do that that that's  some visual radio right there tank hankerous intro the virus yeah could we have the ultimate warriors 
[02:45:30]  say goodbye and then it's kind of the mc of this whole fucking disaster yeah just kind of uh wing  it you know ad lib a little ultimate warrior says goodbye leaving the mic let me bring tank hankerous  back on for you and then tank hankerous says hey enjoy the show thanks to the ultimate warrior and  now we're going to bring in the virus and then you come in as the virus right it's perfect got a  punchline and then you have to do a punch yeah but it's easy because it's on a charlie sheen  i bet you're never taking another fake sick day again huh 
[02:46:00]  next time i start throwing up i'll just come right in here and do it  do we have some  do we have some music to bring all this together you think  well we know the virus's music we got that i guess the ultimate warrior is leaving so we start  with the ultimate warrior music and that'll fade out as tank hankerous takes the stage again  yeah all right you ready you rock what's the problem like tank hankerous's music should be

Yeah, the right to kill me, but not judge me.  The warrior said it first.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Charlie lifted that.  Yeah, it's an apocalypse.  Come on.  Come on, Bernie Big Mac.

[03:00:30]  Oh, someone just called you two and a half men.  Are you thinking over there at least?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you doing, Virus?  Doesn't seem like a hell of a lot.  Trying to think of a punchline.  There's so many.  Virus, why, just answer the question.  Why is it so hard for you to think of a punchline?  Yeah.  Because I'm not really a stand-up comedian.  Now, answer with some more vigor.  I don't like the way you use it. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Because this is not normally what I do.  He can say that when he's working.  Andrew Dice Buffet.  Joan Rivers of Gravy.  Cigars and Scotch.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Come on, Virus.  One punchline.  Come on.  One punchline.  Come on, Jim.  Carry out.  Andy Pee in Atlanta.  Just what do you think?  There's no more left.  Don Ripples.  What's that? 
[03:01:30]  Don Ripples.  I heard you.  Def Comedy Ham.  Roseanne Candy Bar.  Damon Wayans.  Howie Man Boobs.  You're doing it to yourself.  If you had a punchline, half of this would have never made the radio.  Bad from Unaki with that one.  Dean Cookie, a little variation.  Nice, Brian.  Sloppy Joe Rogan. 
[03:02:00]  And anytime.  Come on.  You can end this.  I think if he does a set up, it always.  It does.  It always helps.  It sparks something in his brain.  So go ahead, Virus.  Set it up.  Don Pickles.  Did we do Roseanne Barbecue?  No.  David Cooper.  Come on.  Almost done.  Ron White Castle.  Chris, Ohio. 
[03:02:30]  That's going back a ways.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sid Caesar salad.  There's so many tweets coming in, I can't even follow you.  I can't even follow you.  Come on, Iraq.  Shit.  Come on, Iraq.  You're there.  You mean Virus.  Or Virus.  Yes, Virus.  Sorry.  That's why it wasn't answering me.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, come on.  No?

[03:03:30]  Ah, fuck.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Jim Muller.  I just made that one up because he moves.  It's funny.  Thank you.  Richard, Jenny, Craig.  That's good.  Casey in L.A.  Justin in Pittsburgh.  Dana Carvey up a turkey.

[03:04:30]  Oh, he's got one.  He put his finger up in the air.  Go ahead.  The Oscars.  You all see it.  Anything.  Who cares?  Here comes the virus.  Yes.  Come on.  Come on, Barney.  I'm starving.  Raven Maniac on Twitter.  Well, guys, you know, things have gotten so crazy in Libya.  How crazy? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  What happened?  You had it.  I thought I was going to do that.  Come on, Virus.  Just go with it.  I'm sure it's good.  Yeah, go ahead.  Just go with it.

[03:05:30]  How crazy?  Gaddafi needs all the help he can get.  So we called and got career advice from Charlie Sheen.  All right.  You know what?  Get the fuck out.  It was fun before.  Yeah, what the fuck?  It was so much fun, and then he ruins it with a fuck.  Horrible joke.  Jokes and stuff.  Oh, God.  It's like a third grader would tell that joke.  It's so stupid.  It's so dumb.  He slams the door.  Jay, please, sir, can I have some more?  You know the beauty of your... 
[03:06:00]  He slammed the door and has nothing to do with the pit.  He's so pissed.  He gets all...  He slammed the fucking door.  You can see his face just trying to think of...  That's the validation of everything he's afraid he is, which is a lump.  It really is.  Poor Iraq.  He was so...  Did we do Paula Poundcake?  No.  Brian Stone, Quincy, Illinois.  Paula Poundcake.  Ricky Gingerbite.  I thought of... 
[03:06:30]  Don't shit sniffer.  Heavy Youngman is funny.  Heavy Youngman.  I've never seen Twitter explode like that.  Wow.  Fucking...  There's got to be hundreds.  Frank Calamari.  Robert Jelly.  There's so many.  Yeah.  Good job, guys.  Meeting the listeners on that one.  Yeah, there was some...  You saved a really bad bit.  It was just fun to me to fucking... 
[03:07:00]  The little bit wasn't really working.  I just enjoyed...  We pulled it out of our ass in the end, though.  His voice being ruined.  Yeah, wrecking his voice.  I just enjoy the anger in the end.  Yeah.  Oh, shoot.  Just get so mad.  I was looking at this paper.  Some of those quotes were Charlie Sheen quotes.  Of course they were.  Oh, no.  Travis, how could you screw it up?  And you actually thought...  I thought it sounded...  Because they were so similar a lot of times.  Yeah.  It's early in the morning when I find this stuff, and I'm, you know, sometimes I'm just...  Yeah, you fucked up a little bit today, Travis, huh?  Shit. 
[03:07:30]  I'll try to do better tomorrow.  I'm going to apologize to E-Rock off the air, that's for sure.  Hey, uh...  Off the air.  We got Car Crash Comedy on Friday.  Yes.  That's right.  I can't wait.  I have my, by the way, my most embarrassing tape, so if we ever need that, I do.  By the way, did you notice we needed a little filler there, Jim?  Oh, no.  I do have it.  I want to thank Jesus.  All you had to do was hand that over, and we didn't have to do that Ultimate Warrior  crown.  Oh, I forgot.  Tomorrow, can we do it?  Sure.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Can we play some of the bad Car Crash Comedy guys tomorrow, too? 
[03:08:00]  Please.  Do we have a few of those?  From this round of submissions, or from yours?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Do you have one right now?  I know that sounds crazy, but...  No, I don't.  I mean, I can burn it, but I don't think...  Also, I think we're finally going to do Deadliest Snatch, right?  Deadliest Snatch.  It's on the books?  Yeah.  When are we doing?  A week from Friday?  Yeah, next Friday.  So we need women?  Well...  Whatever the rules are. 
[03:08:30]  There's weird rules.  Well, if women want to do this, what do they do?  We have to be able to talk about this somehow.  Exactly.  You don't know, Travis?  I don't blame you, by the way.  I'm not...  How do we talk about it, then?  I just talk about it, and, you know...  And then you hope something happens?  You know, we've always wanted to do the Deadliest Snatch.  Wait, we're not...  That's where girls, you know, they come down, right?  And you can...  The one with the smelliest pussy is, like, the best. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, the champion.  The champion.  Opian Anthony champion.  Right.  So we can explain what the whole bit's about.  Yeah, talk about the bit.  So we're looking for women.  I don't know.  Are we looking?  They're supposed to, like, just magically...  I'm just describing it.  They're supposed to magically figure it out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just hear this and go, like, oh...  Oh, okay.  And then what?  Seriously, how do we sell this thing?  Well, there'll be...  Some women will be here.  I don't know how to do this new way of radio.  How do we do this?  No, I think, you know, everybody knows what Deadliest Snatch is.  And, you know, we get lots of, you know, phone calls and stuff. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, I mean, some women will end up here, you know?  I would love to hear from girls that might have deadly snatches and want to call up.  That would be cool to listen to, right?  If a girl wants to call up.  Could one of those dopes come in here and tell us how we're supposed to do this?  Because I don't know how to do this new radio.  This new radio is strange to me.  Let's just talk about it.  And, you know, things just happen.  We have to be vague, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just talk about it and things happen.  Like, remember when it was all getting set up before and women started calling in? 
[03:10:00]  Right.  That's how we're doing.  But do we have a promo if you want to be part of this?  No.  Why would you need that?  No, no.  Promo for what?  We just talk about it.  We go, hey, we like that, an idea of girls with smelly pussies.  You know.  They could come in.  They could come in.  Well, how do we get them then?  Hey, do you have a smelly pussy?  Call our show.  We'd love to talk to you.  But how do we get them in the end?  Well, you talk to them.  And then maybe, you know, they could put on hold or something if they want to elaborate on the story a little more.  I'm really confused. 
[03:10:30]  Travis likes to get all the dirty details off the air.  So off the air, Travis will talk to these people.  Are we doing another bit?  Nope.  And you didn't tell me about it?  Unfortunately, no.  What?  This is it.  Do you like this down?  What's going on?  See, this is how...  It's very transparent.  I'm being completely honest.  Here's...  Can we at least talk about the old days?  The old days, if we wanted to do a contest, we said...  Oh, yeah.  You can talk about the old days, I would gather.  Sure.  So in the old days, if we were talking about a...  Let's call it a... 
[03:11:00]  Smelliest Balls.  Right, right.  Smelliest Balls.  Has nothing to do with Deadliest Snatch, right?  So we're doing a Smelliest Balls contest.  I remember the Smelliest Balls from years ago.  So when we used to do something like that, we'd go, hey, guys, you got Smelly Balls, call us now.  Yeah.  And you could probably be part of our contest, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So now with this new contest, which is very different than...  It's not a contest.  What are you talking about, a contest?  Oh, it's not even a contest.  There's no contest.  See, we're just looking for girls. 
[03:11:30]  We're doing a show.  We're doing a show.  So if girls want to call up, the subject matter is Smelly Pussy.  Right.  If you have a Smelly Pussy, call us.  So we're not going to be doing this bit, huh?  Why?  Huh?  How do we get the people?  Because the girls will call now.  Because we're talking about Smelly Pussy.  I mean, either they do or don't.  It doesn't matter.  Whatever it is, but they could call up.  And then once they call up, you go, wow, you've got a Smelly Pussy.  And Travis will be like, hey, by the way, I want to talk to that girl a little off the air.  Tell me a little about that.  Are we doing who's on first? 
[03:12:00]  And then he talks to them.  I don't know who's on first.  What?  I hope they have a Smelly Vagina.  That's right.  Right.  Do you know what's going on, Jimmy?  Honestly, I haven't known what's going on since 9 o'clock.  It's just something where the listeners can get excited.  Can we talk about what we're looking for?  We're not looking for anything.  What are we looking for?  Oh, my God.  You guys are trying to read us.  I mean, what are you talking about?  We're looking for girls to call us up to be part of this show today to just talk about their Smelly Pussy. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, if we want to talk about it today.  You can tell me.  Did I have a stroke?  I had a stroke, right?  Bertation.  You understand what I'm saying?  Fidlisk.  Merd.  Barnsk.  Am I speaking properly?  Maybe tomorrow we'll take some phone calls from people.  Right.  Wait, so we're not having a contest.  Exactly.  But we want to do this thing.  No way.  Well, we want to do this thing that's very vague, and if women could figure it all out,  they would just kind of do what? 
[03:13:00]  We're going to do a show called Deadliest Snatch a week from Friday.  Okay.  Before then, I mean, as this show goes, we'll probably end up talking to some girls about  their vaginas.  Yeah.  And then it'll all come together on its own magically.  How do they get here?  I mean, they...  See, look.  There's a girl.  Is that a girl calling from Dallas, or is that a guy's name?  Ezra.  Ezra is a boy's name, but maybe he knows a girl.  Ezra?  Better than... 
[03:13:30]  Maybe it would help if you didn't call contestants fat when they call.  Well, they're not contestants.  No.  Oh, so they're not even contestants.  Well, there's no game to be played.  No.  Then why are we talking about this?  Because we like to talk about smelly vaginas.  It's one of our topics.  So we're not doing this.  We are.  Doing the show.  A week from Friday.  A week from Friday.  So we've got to get people.  No.  The Deadliest Snatch show is happening a week from Friday.  If you're a girl with a smelly pussy, call us up.  We'd love to hear about it.  We'd like to talk to you.  And then what happens? 
[03:14:00]  Don't worry about it.  And then we talk to them about the smelly pussy.  And then we put them on hold, because Travis loves in the other room, off the air,  to talk to them.  And then, you know, somehow, things will happen by Friday, based on the conversation Travis  has.  You're thinking long-term.  You need to be short-term.  Right.  Right here is right now.  That's all we want to hear.  Today's show is what we're focused on.  That's the first time anyone's ever accused anyone on this show of thinking long-term. 
[03:14:30]  That's true.  So if you want to be part of this...  No, no, no, no.  Today?  You mean today?  No.  Today.  If you want to be part of this conversation...  Is there prize money?  What?  There's no prize.  For what?  Eee, calm down.  Oh my God, you guys...  What happened to me?  Seriously, tell me.  How could we get...  Did I lose my mind overnight?  What happened?  There's no prize or contestants, because there's no contest.  Right.  I'm speaking for all the listeners.  What the fuck's going on?  We're going to put on a show a week from Friday.  We're doing a show. 
[03:15:00]  Called Deadliest Snatch.  Now, never mind that.  All right, let's go to the phones and get people for the show.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  That's what you just do, though.  We're going to forget.  People just show up.  Jimmy, anything?  I'll be in San Francisco that day.  All right.  At Cobbs.  I don't know what's happening.  Wait, you're not going to be part of this sort of show?  It will be a full show.  No, nobody told me until I was already booked in San Francisco.  Can we talk in dreams?  No.  What type of a dream?  I don't know.  Dreams aren't real, right?  It's so easy. 
[03:15:30]  Here it is.  We, we, you know how we pop subject matter up on the air to just talk about it?  Bing.  Hot topics.  Hot topics.  Hot topics.  Well, the hot topic for today and even tomorrow's show.  Sure.  Will be girls with smelly vaginas.  But I remember this much before I had my stroke, obviously.  Yeah.  That the girls don't have to necessarily have a naturally smelling vagina.  Oh, whatever their story is.  I don't care.  They could stink it up for this non-contest with no prize money.  Well, there is no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're confused again. 
[03:16:00]  We're talking about people calling in on a totally, you're talking about something that's  totally separate from people calling in.  Here it is.  Let's, let's do a little game.  Okay.  Are you a girl?  Yeah.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  My name is Cindy.  Hi, Cindy.  How you doing?  Does your, your show.  Does your cunt smell?  Oh, God.  Um, well, yeah, actually, you know what happened the other day?  Uh-huh.  Um, I, because I'm usually pretty clean and my pussy doesn't stink.  Right.  But I was, uh, taking some cat food out of the can and putting it into my cat's, uh, 
[03:16:30]  dish for it to eat.  And the fork flung some of the cat food all over my, uh, pussy because I was feeding him  naked.  And, uh, and my pussy smelt like cat food.  It was disgusting.  So.  No, now I, I kick in.  Why do you kick in?  I go, hi, how you doing?  What's going on?  I go, wow, that's amazing.  You know what?  Hold on for a minute.  I think Travis wants to talk to you.  Why?  Oh, okay.  He's like a pervert.  Oh, Travis is a pervert. 
[03:17:00]  And then, and then she's on hold and then it's like, and then, and then she, the next thing  she hears is, hi, this is Travis.  Hi, what could, what could I do for you?  She's like, yeah, um, you know, I'd like to maybe come down and watch the show at some  point.  Well, next Friday sounds fine.  Because that's when we have the studio space.  Yeah.  And then she goes, okay, I'll be there.  All right.  So she's going to be part of the, uh.  There's nothing to be part of.  Who knows? 
[03:17:30]  Whatever, whatever happens then happens.  But we're just looking for part one.  You're looking at part fucking 15.  And it's not even related, really.  And part one starts, you know what part one is?  All right.  Rolling the boulder down the cliff.  Ah.  Part 15 is the boulder at the bottom of the cliff.  Hopefully.  Don't worry about all the in-betweens.  Hopefully part 15 is the boulder rolling over the lawyers.  Well, I mean.  I can agree with that.  So, are we allowed to, uh.  No.  No, we're not. 
[03:18:00]  Well, no one's going to come down here if they think they have a naturally dirty pussy.  Can we at least get it out there that if this vague thing that we might do.  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We can't even say that?  Why would you?  What you'd say is.  Nothing happening.  Call today if you have a smelly vagina.  And by the way, it could be natural or unnatural.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  But that's for calling today, not.  Girls would just be calling.  Calling.  And talking about their stinky pussy.  Natural smelling.  That's why I was doing the cat food flipped into there. 
[03:18:30]  It could be that.  It could be an infection.  It could be the fact that she just fucking scrubbed their pussy with fucking rancid meat.  And then if Travis is into it, I would listen and jerk off or whatever he does back there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  With that weird voice.  And then, I don't know what goes on.  I don't know what deals Travis makes back there as far as allowing people in.  But then maybe they would show up and hang out.  If that's worked out, I mean, who knows?  That's what they want to do.  I threw in the white flag.  You win.  Whatever you want to do to me today, it works. 
[03:19:00]  No, no, no.  This is just.  You win.  How is it handled?  The flag is.  Talk about it in the talent meeting.  Really?  Or the creative meeting.  Well, that should be a lot of fun.  Fuck Wellmont Theater this fucking Saturday.  Who cares if it's not sold out?  Failure, I am.  Two for Tuesday was so much easier.  It just was so much easier.  Here's two from Skinner.  Fucking that's 20 minutes of music right there. 
[03:19:30]  No.  Can't lose.  That's easy.  How hard is that?  Winner.  Winner.  Winner.  Yeah.  Not that there'll be a winner for this thing we're talking about.  No, I wasn't talking about that.  No, no, no.  Because there's nothing to talk about.  What is there?  So we're not doing this.  Not this Friday, obviously.  Or next Friday.  Next Friday, we'll have a show called Deadly a Snatch.  Deadly a Snatch.  That's the name of the show.  Next Friday.  It's like when an episode of a sitcom has a title.  You understand?  Yeah, I guess.  And we'll have a studio audience that day, probably.  Yep.  Rolling.  Or not. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know if you're not.  I know, but they'll be in.  Rolling.  Yeah.  We'll have guests in.  We'll have guests in that day.  We'll have guests.  Some fans will come in, maybe.  Who knows?  Whatever.  Whatever it is.  Who knows what Travis talks to those girls about.  Exactly.  That's the whole key to the whole thing.  With that weird voice in his.  Hi, it's Travis.  You've been on hold.  Thank you for waiting.  Gosh, thank you.  That's how he answers.  He's a fag.  He's a bitch-ass motherfucker. 
[03:20:30]  So when is Travis going to be talking to these women?  When they call.  After they call.  Tomorrow.  But there's no reason to call.  Yes, there is.  We're going to do a hot topic.  We're doing a hot topic on stinky pussies.  When?  Tomorrow now?  Tomorrow.  That's a tease for tomorrow's show.  Hot topics.  So ladies, if you've got a stinky pussy, we're doing a little call-in thing.  Just call us up and tell us about it.  We're prepping the bit today.  And then Travis will.  And their stinky pussies don't have to be natural.  They could have fell into something weird.  Oh, yeah.  We don't care.  We're almost on the same page. 
[03:21:00]  We don't care.  I'm crawling back onto the same page as you.  Girl, you're coming back from your stroke.  Yes.  You're going through therapy.  This is how that woman fucking...  This is how she saw it.  Holy shit.  This is how that reporter saw it.  Yeah.  She thought it was totally fine.  Everything's fine.  Hunky-dory.  Wow-wee.  It is fine.  Let's do our meeting.  You'll be an entity show.  You'll be an entity.  The motor virus.  The Sirius XM.  Get ready, America.
