<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between current events, movie reviews, sports, political commentary, and sexually explicit discussions.  The show opened with a discussion of the Icelandic volcano eruption's impact on air travel, the Boston Marathon, and the difficulties faced by travelers, including John Cleese's expensive cab ride.  They reviewed *Hot Tub Time Machine* and *Kick-Ass*, debating the latter's graphic violence and frequent use of the word "cunt."  Callers contributed their opinions on the films, the volcano, and other topics, including a humorous anecdote about the "Green Men" at Vancouver Canucks games.  The anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco siege were briefly mentioned.  The hosts also commented on a meteor sighting and Whitney Houston's reportedly terrible concert performance, speculating about her possible crack cocaine use.

The show then shifted to sports, beginning with a discussion of the Montreal Canadiens' nickname "Habits" and the nicknames of the New York Yankees and Mets.  They moved on to critique the CBS show "Strike Force," focusing on a post-fight brawl and questioning its authenticity.  Guests Steve Vegas and "Mongo the Trucker," along with callers, offered their opinions. Jason Miller and Jason Ellis's involvement was also discussed.  The death of Lane Staley and Willie Nelson's controversial comments questioning the official 9/11 story were discussed, prompting a debate about the World Trade Center collapse. A caller countered with a reference to a previous 747 incident in the Netherlands.  Dr. Michio Kaku then joined via phone, explaining the science behind the World Trade Center collapse, the Icelandic volcano, asteroid threats, and the 2012 Mayan calendar predictions. Joe Rogan later called in, offering his perspective on the "Strike Force" brawl, confirming it was not staged, and discussing his podcast and upcoming WEC events.  *Bottle Rocket* was briefly mentioned.

A later segment focused on the hosts' and a caller's shifting sports allegiances, with a caller abandoning the Baltimore Orioles for the Yankees.  Further discussion of *Kick-Ass* followed, with the hosts initially dismissing it before revealing its box office success.  A significant portion of the broadcast then devolved into a graphic discussion about a bestiality farm, prompting a "if you had to" game with explicit descriptions of animal genitalia.  Tangents included discussions of Larry King's singing and personal life, interspersed with audio clips of crying from *Intervention* and Larry King singing.  Bob Kelly was mentioned as a previous guest who discussed *Kick-Ass*.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the bestiality farm and its website's sexually explicit content.

The final segment began with Anthony recounting a date with a woman named Vixen (the name's accuracy was questioned), including visits to a Brazilian steakhouse and a bar, followed by an anecdote about a Playboy model and a woman found in his closet.  A caller mentioned a Chris Matthews program linking the Tea Party to potential terrorism, sparking a heated debate about the Tea Party, the political climate, poll reliability, and the perceived biases of conservative and liberal media. The discussion included a caller's description of a New York City Tea Party broadcast on Sirius Patriot, leading to further discussion of political radio commentary.  A pre-recorded prank call to a British soccer show with inappropriate and sexually suggestive comments was played.  A significant portion focused on a vulgar and explicit online search for a picture of a camel's vagina, with the hosts and callers offering various search terms and reacting to disappointing results. The segment concluded with the hosts admitting defeat and promoting the next day's show, featuring Colin Quinn, and a pre-recorded Radio Shack phone call. The overall tone of this segment was highly vulgar and sexually suggestive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Hell, my boy!  I still love you! 
[00:00:30]  My favorite clip. Oh, my God.  That one is one for the ages.  Oh, that is a great one.  Morning, welcome to the Opiate Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody. Hi.  What's going on with stupid Iceland?  Still erupting.  Ashes are a little lower.  People stranded all over.  Held at bay from a Earth zit.  And Earth zit. Popping. 
[00:01:00]  It's affecting the tourist dollars here in New York City.  Tourist dollars.  Let's get those planes back in the air.  We need fucking German tourists wandering around Times Square  thinking they're seeing New York City.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, really.  You ever think that?  And Friday is going to make any money.  No, you ever think Iceland would be the reason why the Earth would end?  You think it's that serious? The end of the Earth?  Well, they got another... What are they saying?  I followed this story all weekend.  There's another volcano right next door. 
[00:01:30]  That's even worse.  And what? Is that one bubbling?  That one's...  That one's simmering?  Supposedly it's way overdue.  And supposedly it's way bigger than this one.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yikes.  It's way overdue.  See, we're all cool and shit until stuff happens.  Until the Earth decides to...  Like a dog when they shake the water off their back.  Yeah, right.  That's what the Earth does every so often.  It goes...  And like a bunch of people just fucking die.  Or shit doesn't work.  And us humans think we got it all figured out.  Yeah, we're the best. 
[00:02:00]  Look at us.  We can fly.  Oh, shit.  Wait.  Oh, wait.  We can't fly.  Which means what?  Well, which means it'll ruin economies all over the world.  Yeah.  Which would pretty much destroy everything.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I think England is sending a flotilla over to France.  Right.  The ship people back to England.  Like, we have to go back to, like...  The Titanic.  Yeah, the oldie days.  Yeah, they're taking furries.  We have to go before aircraft technology and, yeah, ferry people to and from. 
[00:02:30]  Now, they haven't flown in a week?  Are we up to a week?  Some places, yeah.  I love what airline decided to do test flights.  And can you imagine that pilot?  Oh, great.  Yeah, I think Lufthansa did some.  They're fucking ballsy.  They're German.  You know, what the fuck?  Well, I got to go take a test flight to see if this fucking plane stays in the air.  What do you think the pilots were doing looking at each other like, huh?  Of course.  Here it comes.  Hi.  Oh, yeah.  Hi.  Hi. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That had to be a nerve-wracking little flight.  Well, now a few countries are like, fuck that.  They're watching how much money they're losing.  Like, get those planes back in the air.  Yeah, they're starting to say things.  You're hearing some chatter like, I think they're making a little too much of this.  This is like, you know, the swine flu thing where they made a big thing of it and kind  of didn't pan out to the levels that it is.  So maybe we could just fly around through this stuff.  Oh, they're thinking about the economy.  Yeah, of course.  Get those fucking planes rolling, man.  Although Germany, I think, is still saying no to the planes. 
[00:03:30]  Sure.  No.  Nein?  Oh, big day in Boston.  Today's the Boston Marathon.  Is that today?  Jimmy James.  Morning, bu-bu-boys.  What's going on, JJ?  Hey, I guess the volcano is also affecting the Boston Marathon.  A lot of the runners either had to take extra long routes in order to get there via other  countries or just can't go.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, a lot of people come from overseas.  Oh, really?  And it does.  It's like flying into Boston is that, you know, you take right through the cloud. 
[00:04:00]  Well, maybe you guys will have more room on, what was it, Route 9?  Yeah.  Maybe a white guy will stand a chance.  Maybe a Kenyan won't win it.  I was going to go with that joke, but I think it's a little further north, all that crap,  right?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, but God...  The Kenyans...  The Kenyans...  Hang on a thing, boys.  Huh?  I don't know if you guys have caught it.  There's some online footage of the Whitney Houston concert over in Germany.  Yeah, classic.  Sounds like Linda McCartney.  Oh, shit. 
[00:04:30]  She's terrible.  I love hearing that.  I don't know why I love hearing when singers just fucking eat their balls.  She's...  Oh, she's terrible.  The rumor is she's back on the crack.  Crack.  She's back on the crack.  Bobby, Bobby got me on the crack.  Bobby got me on the crack.  I can't get off the crack.  She's fucked up.  Who would think that Bobby Brown would have it more together than Whitney Houston after  they break up?  Yeah.  He was looking pretty good on Celebrity Fit Club.  After the crack.  She loves her crack.  Crack!  Fucking sweating like a fucking pedo at his arrangement. 
[00:05:00]  Arraignment.  Arrangement.  Yeah, at his arrangement also.  That's funny.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, so, uh, oh, fuck, I missed Boston Marathon Day.  Never ran in one, but it was a hell of a party every year.  It was always a party for the people that weren't running.  My God.  Just drinking.  We missed the Boston people to turn an athletic event into a drinking fest.  Yeah, into a...  We'll line the roads.  We'll get in every bar and just drink.  Well, it's Patriots Day right there, Jimmy James.  Yes, sir.  I guess they ought to call it something to make up for the drinking. 
[00:05:30]  Well, fuck, everyone gets off to watch the marathon.  Why don't we?  Why don't we?  Yeah, well...  Uh, no, not anymore.  With the economy, that's one of the holidays most people lost, unfortunately.  Oh, really?  Yeah, myself I did.  We lost it.  Oh, so you had to go back to work after having Patriots Day off for all those years.  Oh, wow.  No kidding.  That sucks.  All right, JJ.  All right, boys.  Thanks.  Watch out.  Boston Marathon Day.  JJ.  Wow, that's cool.  I guess.  Yeah.  So the volcano, what, it's not spewing as much? 
[00:06:00]  What's the update?  Uh, they don't know.  It's still spewing, but some of the shit that they have because of the weather systems, it's  lower in the atmosphere, so it's okay.  Like, this shit can stretch up to 50,000 feet.  Jeez.  So if it's under where the airliners fly, then they're okay.  Right, right.  But if it's up there, up above where they fly, then they got to fly right through it, and  that's a problem.  One of the new shows had a helicopter like 100, I was going to say 100 feet, but pretty,  I, I, I, what was it?  I mean, in the tens of feet off the ground.  They were, they got really close. 
[00:06:30]  I forgot how close.  Yeah.  The footage was just sick.  Looking sick.  I hope you saw that over the weekend.  Ridiculous.  Sanity.  That nature, man.  Nature's going to win in the end.  It totally can.  It's like just sitting there, everything.  Something, a stupid meteor or something.  There was a meteor that a shitload of people saw last week.  It was giant.  What, that flew right by the earth?  Big, big, giant, like bright, no, it came through the atmosphere.  Oh, really?  And lit up night like day.  No.  Giant fireball. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Yeah.  Where was this?  Visible through like three, uh, three states or something.  Where, where was that?  Where the hell was that?  And where did it hit?  It, they weren't, weren't sure if, if it hit or not.  Or if it just hit anything or just burnt up in the atmosphere or hit, uh, in, in water  or something.  Yeah.  It was Southern Wisconsin.  And it was giant.  It lit up the nighttime.  Do we have video of this?  Yeah.  I got to see a video of the fucking meteorite.  And, uh, that's probably not it.  What do you, what do you, they don't know if it hit? 
[00:07:30]  It had to have hit.  Um, how do they not know?  That shit burns up.  That atmosphere is a bitch.  But it looked, uh, pretty cool.  There's one shot where it's on a street, like this, just regular street with some street  lights on at night.  And you're just, like, close in counties.  You see, like, yeah, here it is.  Look at, look at this.  It lights up the sky completely.  And look at that thing.  What's, that's the meteor?  Yeah.  Giant fucking fireball.  Comedy, adventure, suspense. 
[00:08:00]  I'm too busy looking at the advertising.  Looking at the ad at the bottom.  It was giant.  Yeah.  And it just lit up, like, look at the shadows on the street and everything.  That's pretty crazy.  But, like, one of those hits something.  Yeah, done.  Yeah, you know.  Done.  Most of them hit, uh, you know, remote areas.  Because it's amazing to believe, but most areas on the globe are uninhabited or sparsely  inhabited.  But that hits a city or something.  Forget about it.  It's like an atom bomb going off.  What city is that?  That's a skyline. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, it's in Wisconsin somewhere.  Oh, that's the, is that the Wisconsin skyline?  That's the giant, uh, skyline.  Wow, pretty impressive.  One big building and three almost buildings.  I don't know what that is.  They must, they must be so proud of that one big one.  Oh, my God.  That's like the one that's on all their postcards and shit.  That's the postcard building?  Oh, they got a restaurant up top where you can look down 15 stories.  Oh, my God.  Uh, all right.  Well, people have been in airports for a week or so. 
[00:09:00]  Stranded.  Stranded.  Thank God it's only international passengers.  It's always fun to hear them try to speak English to the news people.  There's also people here just hanging out in airports.  Yeah, yeah.  They can't get back.  They can't get back.  Uh, they were talking to some German gentleman that is thinking about flying to Italy and  then driving back to Germany, which is, you know, something kind of odd about Europe, you  know?  You can kind of go somewhere and then just drive to a whole other country.  Like, there's a shitload of them you can drive to.  You can do, like, ten countries in a day.  Yeah.  People are taking cabs, $5,000 cab rides. 
[00:09:30]  Who was it?  5,000 euros.  Who was it?  John Cleese?  I think John Cleese decided to take a cab.  Really?  Uh, well, if they could find it down the, uh, down the, uh, hall, the John Cleese story,  he took a cab for, like, $5,000, I think.  Damn.  And he had, he went through a couple countries to get back home.  Yeah, they're all linked up or some shit.  And then I guess you could take the chunnel.  You could take the chunnel.  If you're in France.  Ah, but ferries. 
[00:10:00]  Doing the ferries.  Yeah, they're back to, you know, 5,100 bucks cost them.  Yeah, Cleese takes a half-day cab ride for $5,100.  Why is John Cleese so busy that he's got to be somewhere these days?  He had something on.  Oslo, British actor John Cleese of Monty Python fame.  Jesus.  Opted for a day-long cab ride halfway across Europe.  Oh, my God.  After the, uh, the dust plume from an Icelandic volcano left him stranded. 
[00:10:30]  I like that they're calling it an Icelandic volcano.  And no one's trying to pronounce this volcano's name.  I don't think I've heard one newscaster actually pronounce the name.  We probably, yeah, yeah.  I'd love to see how a newscaster pronounces this fucking name.  There should be a montage of newscasters.  Monty!  Trying to pronounce the name of the volcano.  Learn how to pronounce.  Oh.  You're doing it wrong.  Okay.  Here it is.  Pronounced. 
[00:11:00]  I-E-F-R-E-Yut-L-I-A-Y-F-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K-E-L-U-K.  What?  Are you kidding?  Is that...

[00:14:30]  just to see if maybe my initial reaction wasn't right and i kind of like the mist you like the  mist it wasn't like oh my god what a great movie but kind of like it didn't we have the mist guy in  i like the fact that they killed children in it frank darabont that's right the legendary  legendary it wasn't bad i kind of i think i was expecting a little more from the guy that wrote  the fucking shawshank redemption you know yeah i know i mean considering it was obviously the same  author stephen king and same screenplay guy yeah and a couple of the same actors yeah so you're kind 
[00:15:00]  of i went into it thinking this was going to be some like real epic movie and it was just kind of  like i was all right yeah the one guy was a dumb ass yeah alexandre dumb ass it's too much i was  just like that points out duh it's dumb ass i was just talking about near misses because i saw  hot tub time machine yeah now where did i get confused i thought i thought this was getting rave  reviews where did i miss the boat on this one you didn't you didn't dig the hot tub time machine it  was almost good it's it's a movie that was almost good oh but that john cusack i was telling you you're not 
[00:15:30]  a big fan of the i'm not name one movie he was great in i like that 48 fucking one number 48 12  40 oh the hotel room one oh really 14 14 08 he was in 14 08 14 08 um i kind of like that it was a  little creepy now they're giving hot tub time machine 62 percent on rotten tomatoes.com hot tub time  machine now they ripped me off from hot tub johnny now people are going to go with happy face time 
[00:16:00]  machine and club soda time machine now people are going to say i'm only saying this because we're  friends with kevin smith i like to cop out way better than hot tub yeah machine way better yeah 62  percent 60 here's something when you you do a movie about the 80s you should probably throw a lot more  80s stuff in there so they go back to the 80s well yeah what's the gist ah well the hot tub is some kind  of fucking porthole to yeah you know i've had some portholes in my hot tub right but uh portholes to 
[00:16:30]  paradise opie and then they walked through the lobby the ski lodge and then they realized because  of the 80s montage of things going on in that room that holy shit we're back in the 80s like they have  reagan on on screen and says live oh and uh it's what people are wearing and and they showed david bowie  doing an mtv commercial so how did they and then also it's like oh i get it we're back in the 80s and  then guess what how do they utilize that immense power of time travel um to maybe better themselves 
[00:17:00]  or society or something well i certainly don't want to give it away anthony oh really i really don't want  to give away the is it just them dressing in 80s clothes and dancing well or or do they  fucking buy up stock in fucking uh apple well one of the people in involved in the movie might have  done all righty all righty might have but then all started it was just everyone was dressed like  they were in the 80s and that was it there was no real 80s vibe yeah except that they were they 
[00:17:30]  looked like they were from the 80s now you gotta really pump some 80s nostalgia in there so you go  oh i remember that and they uh walk in front of a mirror or they're in front of a mirror and realize oh my  god we're our 80s selves now they were young guys all right all right so they want there's always a  few schools of thought on time travel opie as you can see from the great danny uh ross's shirt he's  wearing his back to the future which is the basis of all my time travel theories but i am willing to 
[00:18:00]  take some forays into this hot tub time machine thing so they go back and they're their age from  the 80s now this is preposterous to me crazy right this isn't time travel to me this is  um uh some type of leap into the actual time itself and one of the guys that goes so then you  would actually you wouldn't remember did they remember that they were in the 80s and and and  in the time yeah yeah yeah oh so now they're young but their mind is full of the thoughts of them 
[00:18:30]  being older yeah yeah fuck you yeah i can't buy that and then one of the younger cocky would laugh  at this uh-huh crispin glover was in this movie and i am a massive fucking crispin glover fan he is a  hollywood weirdo he is the best and what's his name from uh the daily show fucking took the whole  movie what's his name corduroy rob cordry cordry i always say corduroy yeah yeah i might as well just  call him he's a fucking he's a fucking movie star he fucking carried that movie he is good and made 
[00:19:00]  it watchable john cusack not so much no what was cusack's role one of the guys like one of the guys  one of the guys yeah with not a hint of a fucking sense of humor uh in real life john cusack is a  real douchebag from what i've really read and what i've heard in interviews he's a very self uh  important and his opinions are all that matters and he's extremely liberal uh which you know makes 
[00:19:30]  points with me well that makes sense because the concept of the movie was pretty good so he probably  wouldn't listen to anybody said no maybe that's my way so he probably ruined the fucking movie the  way he's gonna do it and then one of the kids is younger and he he goes back with the guys and  he meets his mom that's my mom yeah that's back to wait a minute stop it wait she gets pregnant on  this night did he mess it up and make himself disappear yeah he disappeared for a little while  oh yeah but then but then someone had to continue fucking his mom and then he reappeared wait wait 
[00:20:00]  because that meant that he was going to be a person the father fuck the mom i don't want to  tell you who the father is and then that was that was really it was him he fucked his own mom no no  he disappeared john cusack no one of the guys yes i just like this movie yes and then he's his father  well the kid walks in i i call him a kid i don't even know he's i guess he was in his early 20s walks  in as uh cordry is fucking his mom and loses his mind so cordry stops fucking his mom and then all 
[00:20:30]  of a sudden he disappears the kid ah because he continues he has to fuck his mom right to exist  got you you see hot tub time machine no wow and you see all fucking fucking movies all right this is a  good uh little examination here let's look at the plot elements they ripped off from back to the  future time travel they didn't rip that off from back to the future time travel well let's amend 
[00:21:00]  that and just say time travel with a a conspicuous vehicle with an odd vehicle yes wait did you just  write all this down no it was uh the imdb message boys are oh sports they're a flutter with knowledge  of the future uh yes that yes did happen meeting your parents in the past meeting mom in the past  the amazing crispin glover love crispin did you do that dance i love this stupid dance uh returning to 
[00:21:30]  an improved future yes that happened disappearing if your parents don't connect yes that happened  playing a song from the future that everybody loves yes that happened having someone stay behind in  the past yes and fighting against a group of young men yes and the 80s yes  what a rock oh give me that let's go to somebody go you built a time machine out of a hot tub you know 
[00:22:00]  who's good in it was chevy chase god damn that really don't film the time machine oh i  fucked up oh i know it's him man that chevy chase was in uh hot tub time machine his part was good  small part but really good and uh he's great in community so i don't know what the fuck's going on  with this chevy chase he's having a comeback that he should never have had come on there's another guy 
[00:22:30]  who has just been known as a douchebag his entire career he had a career on snl he had a couple of  funny movies right after snl and then just douchebag well for a year until he turned into an old man  and now he's having a career again the only reason i think he's a douchebag is he wouldn't acknowledge  we were on the same tv show as he was all right yeah the donnie deutch show donnie deutch when he was in  his pink sweater and makeup at the same time we were yeah and didn't even want to acknowledge 
[00:23:00]  that we're in the same room even after we said hi hi chevy fuck him in the ass he's  fucking clown shoes cassius what do you got buddy hey uh yeah just uh the trailer and the tv ad for  for hot tub it made it look so fucking hilarious and uh they should start giving out awards for for  turning mediocre movies uh you know for making them look so fucking hilarious for like yeah  well taking trailers and and making them why don't they just have awards for the trailers i'm 
[00:23:30]  i'm calling i'm calling this movie a near miss it didn't suck but it could have been a lot better  a near miss yeah yeah it just it looks so just you know how do you say his name again cordry  yeah cordry yeah cordry he i'm telling you without him this movie would have really been bad that guy  is gonna be a fucking star in movies now holy is that his first uh major role in a movie maybe major 
[00:24:00]  he's been in some other but this is i mean he carried this one though he was he had more lines  than anybody the daily show has had its uh share of people that have come off of there though oh boy  you're right you know and uh and the colbert rapport did you like it cassius uh what what  what do you mean hot tub yeah no no it was just it was so uh you know it's pretty disappointing you  know in parts it was funny the scene where the where they transport through the hot tub that was like  really funny with the public enemy song playing yeah well i uh i went to the movies hoping to see

[00:25:00]  kick-ass yeah 78 everyone saw kick-ass um now did they fuck around with uh the movie as  opposed to the trailer because in the trailer that's some harsh language that kid is spitting  i know there there's a lot of controversy yeah is that what it is oh yeah stupid what the hell is  the um oh god who's the movie reviewer in new york city no in new york city oh yeah help me out  cassius oh rex reed sandy is it somebody on local news yeah yeah yeah he's a real douche he goes he 
[00:25:30]  said that there's so many of them sandy kenny could you get his review of this because sandy kenny because he's  telling the parents to not bring the children yeah even though the children are saying some  outrageous things you you shouldn't bring your children to see kick-ass travis is reminding me  of a story uh we went to a screening when superman returns had come out and uh we we were sitting  right by sandy canyon and patrice was there no no i was there were you there too what movie was that it  wasn't that one maybe it was it was uh tropic thunder no it was uh help me out maybe it's a different 
[00:26:00]  the one that you were at was cloverfield and that was jeffrey lines yeah yeah we went to one with  sandy kenyon where patrice was there oh they're the same guy oh jesus because patrice i was at a  where where patrice said skip it and started booing when the credits rolled i think it was  that was cloverfield yeah and uh jeffrey lines jeffrey line it was yes goes no one asked you  all pissed off it's like you you you review things that no one asked you right and then got up with 
[00:26:30]  his uh notepad and marched out of the theater i'm really annoyed that patrice was booing the movie  and and and you saw with kenyon yeah uh we were sitting right next to sandy kenyon uh for superman  returns and he was not too pleased with patrice's comments either oh really patrice is such an ass  that's great man he's outspoken go figure at the other movie yeah but i want to see kick ass it's  really good and i fucking had to see hot tub time machine stupid hot tub time machine why  why would you see hot tub time machine because i thought it was a good movie no you gotta see 
[00:27:00]  kick ass it's definitely an r-rated movie i gotta fucking say something here um robert kelly  gotta give robert kelly props yeah he's the idiot that came in here wait wait and said that uh  you should pull that audio and we bashed him for it pull the audio because not only did we bash  we kicked we killed him we kicked his ass and no one knew about kick ass no bobby brought it to the  show and we we laughed at him for liking the kids movie and now this is all the rage this  fucking thing the trailer was fucking hysterical so if the movie is that good you know just a kid 
[00:27:30]  saying hey cunts yeah is yeah it's pretty goddamn funny i think yes iraq cursing you're saying about  uh kids coming to the movie i went and saw yesterday about a quarter of the theater were dads with their  kids on sunday not understanding what it was about so the divorced dads and their kids  how about dad turns on a computer i know it does maybe one minute of research but there's kids and  it's superhero stuff so they must be like oh and it's rated it's rated r anyway but but the trailers 
[00:28:00]  on even though it's rated r the trailers on tv make it seem like this is a like a just kids being  superheroes it does it does look like a kid's movie really funny is that hysterical so the movie starts  and you know it starts off okay then it starts getting a little rough as far as um stuff they're  discussing when the little girl is introduced into the movie that's when you start seeing the dads  picking up the kids and and they're out like all these little families just starting walking out  as soon as that little girl uh i'm just i'm just fucking with you daddy yeah that one must be like 
[00:28:30]  whoa okay let's get the kids out if you ever wanted to see a guy punch an 11 year old girl in  the face as hard as he can kick ass is the film for you or or shooter that's great wow yeah get the  robert kelly audio because we beat him up over that uh hey uh cassius thanks brother yeah thank  you guys thank you all right cassius yeah these movie reviewers in new york they just suck they  take themselves way too seriously yeah like they meet like it means anything who gives a 
[00:29:00]  shit what sandy kenyon thinks of a movie jeffrey lyons who asked you any of them i don't think i've  ever read a movie review i look and see like how many stars it is and then go like oh that's an  asshole got no sense of humor or it gives it five stars and then i start thinking the movie sucks  because the stupid review gave it five stars and it is i do not value his opinion no let's  let's read it shut up let's say hi to josh in connecticut josh hater josh morning boys morning josh 
[00:29:30]  listen oh you're completely right uh top of time machine was way overrated um it wasn't bad i guess  it really depends on your sense of humor i thought it was kind of funny but i hated the hangover  that movie was hyped beyond belief danny loved the hangover oh my god we were at the borgata i think  and it was on danny loved it i like the hangover i gotta be honest that's not true yeah you would  like it that's not a comedy i don't i didn't like it rip off of every 1960s movie there ever was and 
[00:30:00]  found them hey josh it sucked it was a shite movie danny hated the hangover he hated it it was dumb i just  just it it was so wacky and and and oh i wonder what's gonna happen next oh wackiness get out i  can't i came out of the room and uh and uh they're watching it it's like a key is like oh you see the  hangover it's the funniest thing ever it's fantastic it's funny so they're watching it and i sit down  and the first thing danny goes is look out anthony this movie is so out there and wacky it's crazy 
[00:30:30]  what these guys are doing after night out whoa and keith just told him to shut up and he was  getting pissed he was fine he was he was talking about it like it was like ben hur or something  it's a fucking classic it's a movie about guys who drank too much let's relax here  i didn't mind the hangover i mean i didn't love it but you know what it is there's always a group of  actors uh that make all these great movies like when seth rogan was in he made you know knocked up and 
[00:31:00]  pineapple express yeah and then after like two or three of those movies they start to bomb i don't  know if it's them or the writers but i still think seth rogan is hysterically funny like i like his  movies i just think he's a funny character yeah but yeah you could tell like if he does the same guy  in eight movies you're gonna get a little tired but this guy hated the hangover and you loved hot tub  time machine yeah i like i like the hangover better than fucking hot tub time machine see that's when 
[00:31:30]  it you know like a lot of times i agree with you guys a lot but there's other times where i go and  and i guess it really just depends on your taste and movies and your sense of humor of course what  you like about hot tub what did i like about it yeah why do you think that was a great movie i i like  rob cordry he was hilarious you're right he did carry that was really funny and he was really funny  what what's that black guy's name from the office there the man what's his name robinson uh craig 
[00:32:00]  robinson yes right just just his his demeanor is hilarious his delivery is great well he had one of  the better scenes in the movie because he discovered while he's back in the 80s that his wife might have  been cheating on him oh so he couldn't so he couldn't take it anymore so he called his wife and starts  motherfucking her and just going to see are you sucking his dick are you doing all this really  harsh language and and they just show a nine-year-old girl in her little little bedroom oh okay that makes 
[00:32:30]  sense that was all right boys punch it out but that sounds like there were a few good scenes man  uh let's say here what happened as soon as this water hits 88.8 degrees you're gonna see some serious  shit uh now that would have been funny see let's say hi to who we got joe in pennsylvania joe uh what's 
[00:33:00]  up boys you following hey hey we're gonna we're gonna knock off some shit today hey oh what all right  we're gonna just knock off some today your flyers are looking pretty good brother listen dude i'm from  new jersey originally go devils ah see that's why i bring it up you never know what you're gonna get on the other  hockey's still being played what hockey playoffs flyers are up uh two to two games to one over  your devils right sir sorry yeah whatever all right i'm just watching nine and three yankees 
[00:33:30]  uh hey i saw kickoff this weekend it was awesome best movie i've seen since the dark night i went home  and i checked out roger ebert's review and he is such a douche gave it one star he kept saying it was  morally reprehensible and he could not get over like a little girl cursing and killing like tons  of people now now who saw the movie here sam did i did yeah so what's the problem with this movie that  people would have a problem with well i mean the language that the little 11 year old i guess she's  like 13 in real life right i mean she uses very harsh language and the movie is extremely violent 
[00:34:00]  is there a lot of blood a lot of blood a lot of like it's more sensationalized it's not realistic  violence is it a comedy yeah it's funny comedy action film there's two deaths and a jerk off scene in  the first three minutes that's awesome like it's a dark comedy i gotta i gotta but it's like a lot of the  stuff you see in the movie you'd think they would never be able to get away with putting this in a  movie like a little kid busting out the sea bomb it's great yeah it's fantastic it's you don't see 
[00:34:30]  that every day very cool look at that there's a volcano and michu kaku on uh can we get michu  kaku on the phone today well the uh hot magma that comes out is much like the pie filling in a  mcdonald's apple pie you must be very careful not to put your tongue on it thank you meet you  all right there joe thank you let's say hi to billy in south jersey billy 
[00:35:00]  what's up billy yeah did you see the uh vancouver knuff game the other night  well i see that you want to talk about the green guy the green guy still doing his thing  he had a green guy the uh i forget who it was he got a penalty and uh he's in he's in the box and  the dude's doing a handstand he's grinding like he's pumping the plexiglass and the other guy was  holding like a car now i thought that's an old video the green guys are still allowed to do that i 
[00:35:30]  thought they would have kicked him out of the arena by now no they were going off it was hysterical  and then after the game i went up google on it and here they got their own they got a facebook  oh yeah i i i i think i showed this to you uh showed this to you a couple weeks maybe a month  ago and there's two green guys they sit next to the penalty box and they're flaming homosexuals and so  when the opposing team is in the box for a penalty these green guys are doing just  weird horrific things to the um the glass like uh mind dancing and all it was i was going i was 
[00:36:00]  laughing my ass off and then i wound up googling it and or at youtube and here they got they got a  a couple different clips tell me that's not funny all right the guy's in the penalty box and these  green guys are just next to him goofing on him now he's laughing the guy in the penalty box is watching  laughing yeah they're doing the crying thing they're like they're completely dressed in green what  assholes they don't have they don't even have they don't have anything that looks like faces because 
[00:36:30]  the green just covers everything no they're like very like leotards yeah yeah and they just  harassed the guy in the penalty box i thought billy man thanks for the update because i thought they  figured out a way to make make it where these guys couldn't do it anymore i was i was laughing  if you if you pop a couple more videos check out where well he was doing like a handstand the one  dude to the closest to the ice and he was like popping like he was popping the glasses oh they're 
[00:37:00]  saying it right there the green men uh return oh that's from january though but okay they're still  blue thank you how distracting how great is that for a player in that box to just not like even  not looking is distracting because you have to concentrate so much on not looking and everyone's  laughing oh they stink yeah they're in green leotard that goes from head to toe head to toe like skin  tight right but they got no eyeball holes or anything in there they're just i don't know how they could 
[00:37:30]  even say look retarded dancing green man they're dancing out in the parking lot i guess free game  green man is a character from uh it's always sunny in philadelphia charlie dresses up as green man and  oh okay and raves and rave and rave i think when he's on drugs let's say how to dan in knoxville dan  hey what's going on guys what's up dad oh b what are you thinking you couldn't possibly go to that  movie hot tub time machine you think it's gonna be like a good movie did you well i'm a fan of comedy

[00:39:00]  don't know it's probably kind of like a b-grade movie but it just looks like that one would kind of  be i was walking home discussing saying it's i don't know why they can't make a really good  comedy these days yeah yeah apatow has figured it out he certainly has but but we got to wait for  the next apatow movie to laugh again to really laugh about it you're laughing cast yeah girl saying  the c-word and getting punched in the face he's fucking fantastic all right dan thank you sir hey

[00:40:00]  movies with these with these trailers the trailers yeah oh jesus it is where is it you got it it is  green man all right all right all right all right all right all right all right man thanks  green man it's just ah shit god that's funny what an asshole this guy is that's another good thing 
[00:40:30]  about kick-ass though it actually was not at all given away by the trailers that are on tv  uh not on tv on the website that i saw there was like the the one where she's just kicking ass  yeah kicking ass she does yeah she kicks ass flips and fucking shooting guns and she throws knives  like the one where she flips the clips out of her gun and just turns them upside down two more clips  fall into her gun and she's shooting again she's 11 it's great she better kick that's even better 
[00:41:00]  the movie makes it even better she's got a purple wig on oh who doesn't love fucking girls with purple  wigs on exactly and fucking school girl uniforms wow jesus a little inappropriate as a trick  yes i know yeah there's a girl at the door right and then she comes in and starts kicking ass little  did they know here's the here's the new story on kick ass oh there's a new story well i mean it's  dangerous to the children you know of course it is very dangerous well the story that's got everybody 
[00:41:30]  buzzing around the world  now it says the story that has everyone buzzing around the world anthony now did i just  fuck up or are they still talking about kick ass is that kick ass or is that or volcano or is this the  volcano oh did i just mess up what what do you think i'm going volcano i would change my answer  well the story that's got everybody buzzing around the world in pop culture it might it's what might 
[00:42:00]  be a case of girl power gone god damn it i should have stuck with the original  fuck i stopped why did i change my answer it's okay the whole world is talking about this prize  the whole world yeah  a few people here and there can kick ass give you cancer we'll tell you at 11. the new movie kick  ass has some parents up in arms about its heroine she's a preteen girl who's ultra violent and potty 
[00:42:30]  mouthed in the film the 11 year old hit girl uses profanity breaks one of the biggest language taboos left  on screen in addition to doing things to movie villains we can't show on the air hey i got one of  those the violence and her language have outraged people around the world like the english film  critic who called her quote one of the most disturbing icons and damaging role models in the  history of cinema the film is extremely violent and her flippant use of the c word is unacceptable but 
[00:43:00]  on the other hand the fact that this character is able to break out of the box the norm of what we  see for girls and women on screen you know what why does every why did anything even a kid on screen  have to be a role model right why can't it just be enter-fucking-tainment what happened to that  why can't we just be entertained it used to just be entertainment but now it has to be a role model  so the kids got to be a role model your athletes have to be role models your movie stars have to be 
[00:43:30]  role models and there's radio personalities have to be role models it says concert it says content and  there's no kid that would watch this movie and think it would be good to be a superhero yeah because  they get beaten up yeah you know who wants to have no superpowers they get beaten up and stabbed and  stuff in rich and ridiculous stabbed yeah teenagers are getting stabbed because they're dressed up like  superheroes so don't do that it's just entertainment you're right it you're right it's entertainment that  doesn't have to be a role model oh this uh not a role model who cares although her use of the c 
[00:44:00]  word is flippant flippant hey the movie made 20 million should have i think it should have done a  little better than that i think it was the tv ad campaign confused people confused people i think  word of mouth is going to make uh this thing uh kind of take off a little more oh you think i don't  think you're gonna see a big drop off i think you might see um this thing sustain a little bit  maybe even uh pick up when the publicity gets out that it's a fucking filth-ridden violent movie  it's insane the stupid english they're worried about it yes the flippant use of the word 
[00:44:30]  oh cunt by the way that is the word the over in england they use the word cunt like the stop you  stupid english half a fad country anyway they use it to describe everything you're right yes you're right  but there are no breasts in the movie which surprised me for an r-rated well she's only  11. well not her breasts there could be okay i'm sorry i thought you i i'm sorry i'm terribly  what's up with you i thought you want to see little boobies i thought you were going 
[00:45:00]  you like when they're just budding don't you no little nubs little nubs i'm not gonna high-five  you on that no you're not high-fiving danny on the net give danny a high five i won't do it  high five not high five not on them all right come on you like to see the little nubs  before they get their first bra don't you i was talking about other characters in the film i'm  chris hansen why are you here at this movie uh i want to see nubs i just came for the nubs  the nubs well you're free to leave the theater i know what's waiting for me out there sitting 
[00:45:30]  nude in the theater just jerking off to every scene she's in how long before the cops arrive  where all of a sudden their flat chest their their nips just start swelling and form a dub  before everything else starts growing i'm unfamiliar the nub the nub don't know anything about that  don't know anything about the nub now yeah yeah wow i saw a girl in school once that um um she 
[00:46:00]  didn't have a brawn because she just had nubs and she leaned over uh she like leaned over to get  something on the floor and i was able to look down uh her shirt and i saw her nubs nice they  were very odd looking of course there's a period of time i guess that uh it must only last a few  months in the breast development period but those that nub phase is hysterically funny it's just like  what is it it's very awkward there's just nubs it's not a nip it's not a booby it's just a nub

[00:55:00]  right how many homers so 584 i guess so all right he's only two away from frank robinson that would  put him in seventh and then he's another uh 16 so if he gets 25 homers this year he passes sammy so  sammy salsa and that's about it because then he has another 20 all right if he gets about 46 47 this  year he uh is in fifth place uh passing ken griffey who has 630 lifetime and then willie mays is out of 
[00:55:30]  out of reach this year anyway yeah so a-rod could easily move up to fifth on the all-time list this  year if he has a good year well i certainly hope he does do you that's for sure yes i do but uh yeah  yankees coming out of the gate looking pretty good which scares me because usually when they  start the season looking like uh they do much better toward the end of the season and uh boston  oh ow they need some work there and to end the mets oh ow oh ow we had that fine 20 inning game 
[00:56:00]  on saturday yeah what the hell's that danny and i were talking about that for him before the show i  was stop it i was watching a little bit of that game and then i did about five hours of activities  and then i turned on the tv and i went and danny said the same thing why are they replaying the  mets game i got all confused yeah because like i was so confused too because i know that they  usually don't replay it on on the broadcast channel which locally here is fox they throw it  to yes or something yeah like sny or whatever and like i'm like i was confused you know i'm like 
[00:56:30]  five and the game i'm like why are you playing the game and then i saw on top of the screen it said  it had a little arrow pointing down and it said 19th 19th bottom of the 19th inning inning and for  for if you didn't know it went 20 innings 20 innings a seven hour game 20 fucking innings  final score was like let's play over two games i think that's one now i think a total of combined 
[00:57:00]  from both teams they used 18 pitchers i think that was the final count of them they ran out of pitchers  see st louis used two position players you know great at that point wouldn't it be smart to let  the other team win to save all your pitchers because now you go 20 innings to to win 2-1 and  now you're going to lose the next three out of four because all your pitchers are shot just shot  and uh how do you say that the dude's name for the rockies who uh threw that no hitter  yeah i think it's ubaldo ubaldo i'm thinking is the first name what i'm gonna say who jimenez 
[00:57:30]  jimenez yeah i think they pronounce that as an h right jimenez uh pitches the first no hitter in  rockies 18 year history now that's the first no hitter for the rockies yeah the question i have for  you oh only teams without a no hitter and i did not know about one of these teams in here there's  three teams left that don't have a no hitter don't have a no hitter three teams left i would say 
[00:58:00]  the i think one of these teams will surprise you  the mets yes yep i know i gave it away but no no how do the mets not have a no hitter in their  franchise you would think uh history maybe tom siever would have gotten one even like going  way back you had nolan ryan there for a little while they have a they have 33 one hitters 33 one  hitters couldn't close the deal wow so the mets have never thrown a no hitter that's amazing i  would have never guessed that i would also say one of travis's faves uh-huh baltimore 
[00:58:30]  no we've thrown plenty of no hitters yeah oh baltimore we're a classy franchise all right  all right calm down this year too again we're terrible we're two and eleven two and eleven  you're really bad i'm embarrassed yeah travis where are you from man i was born in baltimore  all right yeah because you love you're white you love the canadians and you love the orioles  well canadians comes from my wife no i understand that no uh my yeah my dad  your own hockey tapes what is the what is what calling them the habs 
[00:59:00]  that's their nickname why habitants what they're the habitants yeah what is that  it goes all the way back to when i don't care how far it goes back i need to know whenever i  see you tweet when they were i want to throw my iphone at you well now i'm just going to do it  more there's a game tonight so but why haves what does that mean the habitants habitants what  does that mean back in the day there was two teams in montreal there was an english team and  there was a french team right so it was like the habitants of french quebec like inhabitant 
[00:59:30]  like they have like that yeah like they were the uh they're the locals yeah so they're the  local guys they're the local guys they're the habitants can you just call them by their  name it's tradition sure and we'll stop calling the yankees the bronx bombers oh  shit i don't call the yankees the bronx bombers they're the yankees they're the yankees and the  bronx bombers is a thing it's not a name it's not like they have the fucking it's not like the mets  call people call them the metropolitans but that's their name but they don't call them that they 
[01:00:00]  should call them the mets the knickerbockers then they should be the haves then they should just be  the haves you're right they're the habitants but then what the is with the canadians they're just  the habitants but then get rid of the canadians call them the haves i like to have a habit and  canadians has nothing to do with haves i believe their original name they call them the cans in english  was the habitants call the cans then they're the habitants or the camera all right you know what i  think my mic off oh shit no you're good turn your twitter off is what you got to do i see haves i want  to fucking bite your face oh fuck at least this team's still playing yeah that's true playing i 
[01:00:30]  don't know what team to fucking follow at this point i'm thinking maybe sabers  exactly the reaction should have got what does it matter what doesn't matter oh so the other two  teams are the padres and the pads and the rays and the earths the only teams without a no hitter  yeah in their franchise history the mets in there is shocking i i would have bet against that  definitely well you know i think relatively speaking to other teams isn't the mets a younger 
[01:01:00]  franchise aren't the mets younger well yeah they've been around 40 right 40 somebody yeah 40  somebody 40 something i'm gonna go 48 years 62 yeah they began playing 62 yeah 48 years yeah so that's  like 48 years and one fucking stupid fucking guy can't throw a no hitter i'm not saying they shouldn't  have one but it's not like the teams that have been around for a hundred and some odd years you  know that's there have been plenty of teams after them that have come yeah have done it the off the 
[01:01:30]  top of my head the blue jays what's the youngest team to have a no hitter uh the rockies rockies yeah  i think so yeah yeah because they uh they we said it 18 years in the league right yeah 18 year history  there's the rockies and the marlins and then uh the rays came in and i can't remember who came in with  the rays no jesus i know yeah we're not quite um mad dog here no he can just blurt those stats off  top of his head let's keep it easy for everybody uh ways let's keep it easy for everybody the abc's 
[01:02:00]  of sports exactly that's what we're good for just hitting the hitting the marks that's all  i want anything deeper go to a fucking mad dog radio yeah 123 on sirius we're just the abc exactly  you see the strike force fight it no i fight after the fights fight after the fights now uh cbs has  been trying to get the strike force going and it's it's their version of the mma right and uh i don't  want anyone to be confused most people aren't especially the mma fans yeah but uh this is dana 
[01:02:30]  white has nothing to do with this fucking league no and it's been a disaster strike force was on cbs this  past uh saturday night and i think it did a 2.3 rating uh which is shit shite well the strike force  did a 1.0 in the ratings but it was a 2.3 share 1.0 rate i don't know i i don't know how they figured  this out it it sucked it stunk i think uh a rerun of law law and order beat strike force on saturday 
[01:03:00]  night but after the fight this happened you'll like uh you just conquered the world definitely  you know i mean i love cbs the strike force they definitely uh weren't giving my due respect but  uh henderson's a true legend man i'm glad you've beaten him uh he beat the crap and the worst  i've ever been beat that first round where's my rematch buddy  wow yeah this is this is ridiculous this is ridiculous 
[01:03:30]  yeah my god all right uh  sometimes these things happen in mma a lot of testosterone in the cage gentlemen we're on  national television gentlemen we're in national television we are going to step away right now  on cbs back right after this why why would you do commercial you know cbs and make believe this 
[01:04:00]  didn't happen can suck a fucking dick look what a way to drop the ball something spontaneous and  exciting happens you know regardless if it should have happened or whatever just the fact that they cut  away you can't make believe something didn't happen cbs is really good at that when it comes to their  radio programming their tv programming they like to make believe stuff never happened you know i  obviously was it scripted uh someone someone is saying uh did they do that on wwe and wwf all the 
[01:04:30]  time where it would be like there's pandemonium in the ring and then they would just cut off and end  the show people are at the end of every uh event there'd be pandemonium in the ring and they would just  cut away and go to people are saying that it might have been set up to create a little buzz a  little talk for strike force yeah yeah uh but this goes against that makes sense everything dana  white's into who obviously has nothing to do with strike force legitimate he hates all that uh  showboating stuff so legitimate mma here you you made the point anthony you probably don't want it 
[01:05:00]  to happen yeah if you're cbs i guess i don't know maybe strike force wanted to happen i don't  know we don't know anything about those guys but if it's if it's going down you might as well go with it  yeah but if it's you might as well go with it if it was staged then they probably knew about it  and wanted to cut away so people couldn't really see how staged it is yeah because it was a weird  cutaway yeah it went blank and uh the audio dropped out and then then they had an overview shot of the  the uh the uh the uh i'm gonna say uh fake that's right fake fake fake fake fake let me say hi to 
[01:05:30]  steven vegas steve yes hey what's up boys hey buddy as one said i watched the strike force it  looks faker than any wws episode i've ever seen it it started out as a wwe thing we have to say wwe  now unfortunately you're old school i understand sorry but uh the wild who took wwf the wild the  worldwide generation yeah because they were way more important than the wwf uh the wwe yeah it started out 
[01:06:00]  like that absolutely hey what i was also going to say yeah yes if you watch the last strike force  uh event they had the diaz brothers did the same thing they ran in at the end of the last match and  started controversy and fights so maybe they want to take that route with their mma have a little more  of a wrestling thing happen what uh what now the guy that came into the ring and said what about the  rematch i don't even know any of these who was that i don't know their names and he had gloves on  i don't know that was uh jason miller he's actually friends with uh the australian guy 
[01:06:30]  um that does radio here but he had jason ellis he came in with gloves on jason ellis all right so  maybe jason ellis will be talking to this guy today i would assume like look at him okay when he steps  up does he have gloves on or did he just step in the way so i don't know gold i don't know okay he  doesn't have gloves on and then they're slipping punches and i don't know maybe that's their thing  to get i'm saying fakeity fake fake fake they're in trouble ufc is taking over the world they're in 
[01:07:00]  trouble this strike force you like strike force steve sounds silly uh no i find it to be totally  amateur yeah i'm not going out of my way to watch strike force i'm going out of my way to watch ufc  though that's a fucking amateur and uh wec uh thank you steve punch now let's say hi to mongo  the trucker bongo let me get this straight they changed the channel or they went to break because 
[01:07:30]  violence happened to fight oh my god panic panic panic violence happened yeah yeah yeah violence  happened and the guy this is national television the whole thing did seem a bit the announcer sounded  fake yeah they didn't play their part well very good hey uh travis you were wrong we beans stop  fighting about what the diamondbacks yeah i know i've realized that after the youngest team to have  a no hitter oh according to many many sources no that's true i forgot that the diamondbacks came 
[01:08:00]  in with the rest uh danny's laughing at you that's fine danny fucked up earlier oh  oh shit you're remembering are we keeping uh count is that what there are 635 danny flub  he's got it mark that's classic let's go to vick in new hampshire vick  vick let's go stop listening to that thing and talk  vick obviously a new listener he is an ass and he's gone now well he he says if strike force  is staged they have a lot to lose i want to know what that's about 
[01:08:30]  hey this is rich from new hampshire you guys am i on with you guys right now yeah brother if you're  going to call the show you got to turn down your radio we're on a little delay i couldn't hear you  very well what i was saying is that if it was staged nick diaz who is a contender for the usc has a  lot to lose because they know why we're not put up with that shit and you might you know kick him out  of the usc which would be bad for nick diaz because like i said he's a contender in the usc so  all right so well we got everyone talking today i i still don't have a desire to watch strike 
[01:09:00]  force stuff but yeah the promotion wasn't that great and i don't know if you guys follow dinner  you guys must follow dinner on twitter but he had a big smiley face on right after the melee happened  on saturday night so i think he was pretty happy that it happened and it's probably going to hurt  strike force and help the usc so because there's a lot of talk about jake shield who won on saturday  and like going to the usc so okay all righty guys thank you sir and finally john and georgia 
[01:09:30]  before we move on to something else john it was hey yeah right after it happened the strike force  ceo made sure he came out and said that mayhem wasn't supposed to be anywhere near the cage it  wasn't staged the athletic commissions are reviewing the page to see who's going to get fined and suspended  and all that all right all right yeah yeah there's always going to be some kind of plausible deniability  there but i ain't buying it hey uh god all our info is wrong today hammered down us hammered down at 63 on 
[01:10:00]  on twitter just tweeted me and said that lane staley did not die today his body was discovered on 420 but  he had been dead since about the fifth oh yeah i do know he was laying in his uh apartment or  whatever yeah rotting for a while rotting for a while and well what do you know they died of the  day they find him what do you what do you do that that's just sad what do you what do you do i say uh  the day they found him because you're not sure exactly when he died you could tell can you yeah 
[01:10:30]  supposedly his body was rotting pretty good by the time they found him so they know exactly if it was  maybe 11 o'clock what if it was 11 o'clock on one day at night or it was one in the morning that's  only a couple of hours and if he's been laying there a while they're saying two weeks so they  probably fucking did some kind of you watch those damn shows i know and then all that but but  especially two weeks you probably found an earwig or something yeah yeah they found a maggot they  found a maggot or an earwig and then they were able to fucking count backwards i don't think they're 
[01:11:00]  able to get it peg it exactly with two weeks two weeks probably uh you know it could be a  day or a day difference maybe unless they know exactly when he well but cop that but basically  what they're saying they found his body on the 20th and they knew he was dead for a while yeah  we're all in agreement that he was dead for a while oh god damn i hope that's not contagious it  probably is i've been sneezing and coughing i think i got the aids that's the pollen oh that or that 
[01:11:30]  it's an allergy or aids no the pollen count is ridiculous they were explaining that in the  newspapers too it's like super pollen or super fucking something i don't know yeah my car was  all yellow because the fucking weather decided to to go to 80 85 degrees out of nowhere now we're  back everything up temperatures yeah it's 47 new york we were we were 40 degrees warmer what a week  ago chill in the air this is not normal uh willie nelson has a lot to say anthony willie has always 
[01:12:00]  been just the cool stone guy and now apparently willie turned into an asshole you're calling him  an asshole i'm calling him an asshole we've had him on the show before well why didn't he never come  back on our show we had a good time with him i probably forgot you think so stoned when we were at  anyw his tour bus parked right outside the station yeah right on 56th street you know manhattan you  know it's pretty busy in that area yeah his fucking tour bus has taken up pretty much the whole road 
[01:12:30]  causing traffic jams everywhere else to willie because people now have to take other roads yeah  and he's just on his bus getting high before his interview with us he apparently gets high before  everything yeah i think he's never uh not high he likes the weed yeah willie nelson on 9 11.  oh god and you know what larry you're gonna hear larry king and surprisingly larry does a  pretty good job here he's on larry king talking about 9 11 and apparently his opinion has changed  too ugh but the second clip i got larry king looks like a complete asshole so good but we start with 
[01:13:00]  this really took part in a great benefit for 9 11 victims and their families he sang america the  beautiful i don't think anyone ever sang it better but he's questioned the official story what what prompted  you to look into this from another angle well i'm just logic uh you know i've seen buildings implode  before i just saw the texas stadium implode just a couple of days ago and these two buildings imploded  and the one next to it where nothing hit it no plane hit the one next to it it just decided to fall on 
[01:13:30]  its own so naturally i have questions about how something was done inside yes all right but i'm told that  with the reason it imploded was the so much heat from above and so much fuel on the jets that that  caused it to go down rather than go over never before has a building collapsed because it was hit by an  airplane a steel building never before now has any building been hit by 747 though i'm sure they have 
[01:14:00]  so you you think there was something going on inside the building well i just questioned the whole  thing i questioned the story i questioned the enclosions uh it just looks too simple you know well  others have questioned it too although there was an investigation there was an investigation and i think  there should be more oh my god too simple really and you just casually say i'm sure the 747 hitting a 
[01:14:30]  building i'm sure it happened before yeah yeah all right well wouldn't that be somewhere we could  look into yeah maybe we can look at that because i don't believe a 747 has ever hit a building i i  honestly don't uh but i mean here's stupid willie nelson who i want to choke with his stupid braids  now after this one that's simple and again we've been over this so many fucking times it's simple to  imagine that both towers were rigged with explosives while people were working there and i don't want to hear 
[01:15:00]  thermite paint i've seen it working and it doesn't work in that fashion uh even super thermite shut up  for my paint uh so willie's saying that's simple but the idea that there's people that hate us in  the world and that hijacked planes and flew them into buildings and collapsed them that's not simple  if you have the capability to take down these buildings why would you involve the planes yeah and  what a coincidence why not just fucking crash planes why not fucking take down the fucking  buildings and then blame it on somebody exactly just say oh they planted explosives right i don't 
[01:15:30]  know what happened right you can't have and when you watch them demolish a building you can see  the explosions so vividly and and they're looking at little sparks shooting out of the side of the  building out of the trade center towers like those are the explosions those are friction  fucking there are generators on on certain floors there are uh mechanical uh things and that that 
[01:16:00]  will catch on fire will explode will you know that's what you saw you saw metal  fucking rubbing on metal making friction and and things exploding you didn't see  like a steady uh well timed explosion of each floor and and and he he mentions uh texas stadium  that's exactly what you saw when you looked at that video any texas stadium right imploded you saw  the individual fucking charges going on do you know how they have to be timed when you take down a 
[01:16:30]  building with uh demolitions it's such a precise art that these guys do when they take down these  buildings and when you watch it and it's not like they've hidden these things from people  you watch stadiums and buildings explode all the time it's a very timed very rhythmic explosion uh  that happens it's it's it's you know bam bam bam you you you hear it nothing like that happened uh to 
[01:17:00]  the towers just stop well uh chester's liver from whack bag i like this he writes how many scientists and  physicists have to explain this before these douches get it they never will holy  shit i hate willie nelson now they never fucking will and the only thing i think it was it uh b25  hit the empire state building back uh many long many many many years ago and that didn't go  fall down because it was um it's a brick fucking building let's say 1945 let's say hi to anthony in 
[01:17:30]  sarasota anthony hi hi how are you doing today guys no actually a 747 did uh impact the building  in the netherlands about 15 years ago it was a cargo aircraft uh outbound if i recall correctly  and what they had was an engine separation i believe on the number three engine which  when it separated it swung outboard hit the number four engine the plane was uncontrollable and basically  what happened was that it struck the two buildings uh right in the middle and they were gone it's just a  hole uh so yeah i mean any you know discussion about you know it's not happening before it has 
[01:18:00]  happened before and the effects are really quite devastating believe me so it took down those  buildings in the netherlands yeah the 747's engines are held on by a trunnion a center trunnion and two  forward uh aft and forward struts and what happens is those bolts hollow and uh water gets in them over  time and they corroded and under a takeoff thrust the engine actually just separated and because it's  thrusting it's flung outward jesus the number four engine and the aircraft is finished so it has 
[01:18:30]  happened oh yeah i just i don't understand when people say like it looks like a controlled demolition  because it's just it just doesn't and it doesn't i just can't understand why people find it so hard  to believe that you know like ten floors of a building falling on top of the rest of the building  yeah like that's a lot of force there i mean picture like a karate guy trying to break through like  you know twenty things of ice or whatever and he does it yeah why is that so probable so hard to  believe like because it's a building it can't have here's another thing that i i don't think i've ever 
[01:19:00]  heard brought up but um wow what a coincidence i guess the world trade center the explosions that um  were set all the charges that were set to bring it down were only set coincidentally enough exactly at  the point the planes hit because that's where the the building started its fall it didn't start  at the top floor and boom boom boom boom it started right where the plane hit wow what a talented pilot 
[01:19:30]  to be able to be told now make sure you hit around the 70th floor because that's where we planted the  explosives it'll look suspicious if we don't do that if it starts exploding on top of where or below  where the plane hit don't be a dummy fucking idiots and what about building seven  shit hit building seven and and and a lot of uh uh fire was in building seven everything around the  area you look at that fucking deutsche bank building got destroyed another building looked like cloverfield 
[01:20:00]  clawed the front of it it was just and you don't think that plane parts flying out of a building with  a fireball that we all saw won't spew flammable shit onto and into a building through the roof down  to the basement generators are down there fucking fuel tanks and everything and building seven was  on fire for a long fucking time i'm surprised more buildings in fall down with the with i know  these two towers hitting the ground look at the corner of building seven they go with no damage 
[01:20:30]  there's an entire chunk taken out of the corner it starts at the 18th floor and goes down to like  the bottom fucking floor and the whole thing was on fire on the bottom don't even start with your  bullshit it's exhausting you know how many charges it would take you know how long they went out to  fucking put charges to to control demolition these buildings i just love how the world trade center  falls on a building and people are like well i can't believe it fell down it's just like how about  it's the world trade center falling on a building two of the biggest buildings in manhattan fell on 
[01:21:00]  this building yeah like there's gonna be some there's gonna be some damage i think yeah no how did it  fall no damage we got a uh shooty's right there damn it uh all right hold on a truther or a gatekeeper  we got uh michu kaku we'll go back to the 911 talk in a second actually dr michu kaku right right  here how are you sir opian anthony of course now uh we were going to ask you about the volcano but  we got into once again the 911 discussion it's so frustrating to us but willie nelson was on larry 
[01:21:30]  king and he's suspicious and he thinks that uh it was a controlled freaking explosion and the building  imploded and blah blah blah could you give us could you give us 30 seconds on that to shut up for  everybody okay so uh what do you want to know well why why why would people think this is a controlled  explosion when obviously planes flew into this building and the effects of fuel on the uh steel 
[01:22:00]  uh brought this down i don't understand how people can't understand that two reasons okay  first of all everyone's been brainwashed by seeing all these controlled demolitions we see it on  television all the time and so when we see the world trade center go down we say aha just like i've  seen all the videos on tv well these people don't know anything about controlled demolitions  control demolitions are done from the bottom you put dynamite on the bottom of the building not the  top you'd have to be an idiot to put dynamite on the top of a building and have it implode right 
[01:22:30]  but the world trade center went top down not bottom up right okay but these people don't know that  because they see all these videos on tv that's the first thing and the second thing is as was said by one  one woman commentator on her show uh fire does not melt steel and she said that over and over  again on her nationally syndicated talk show fire does not melt steel well duh everybody knows that 
[01:23:00]  fire does not melt steel however it weakens steel softens it so that the the softening of steel will  buckle will cause it to buckle under pressure it has nothing to do with melted steel it has to do with  buckling steel weakened steel cannot hold all that concrete and and that's it that's all you need is  weakened steel that's it oh those people how come it takes a theoretical physicist to explain common  sense to people yeah but they'll ignore what michu kaku is saying today and they'll continue down this 
[01:23:30]  thumb rope and you also taught us some people are ideologically married to a certain point of view  nothing nothing you tell them is going to change their point of view nothing and and you also taught us  that most buildings are made of uh air most of the building is made of air yeah the reason why it went  into free fall is of course it went into free fall the building is empty for god's sake i mean how  relatively speaking can close battleships are empty right yeah there you go i think all right all right  this uh now we saw you on uh tv earlier you're turning into the you're turning into the go-to guy huh dr yes 
[01:24:00]  ukaku well you know people want to know about you know what natural phenomenon about physics and about  reality so that's that's what i try to provide you know what do the laws of physics say about the  universe about our own backyard now there's uh this oh we should ask him about the meteor as well yeah  that too yeah uh the volcano what what's your take on the whole thing i i hear there's another volcano  right next door that could erupt and it's and it's too that's right see the good news is that maybe this 
[01:24:30]  will be a simple repeat of 1821 in 1821 the same volcano blew up and the eruption lasted for 13  months but it sputtered it sputtered over 13 months came on came off that that's a good scenario because  eventually the ice will melt and ice is what makes this volcanic eruption so bad the worst case scenario  is that the lucky volcano laki which is nearby could erupt because of this eruption like in 
[01:25:00]  1783 that eruption killed one quarter of the population of iceland mainly due to starvation i  thought i was about to say the world over fifty percent of all livestock were killed by that eruption  causing mass famine and in europe it caused tens of thousands of deaths throughout europe aggravated the  collapse of agriculture for several years in europe some historians say that helped to precipitate  the french revolution of 1789 because the french peasantry were impoverished because of that volcanic 
[01:25:30]  eruption so that's the worst case scenario is if this eruption sets off a neighboring eruption and this  other volcano is much bigger than this volcano which is actually quite small by the way this is a small  eruption aggravated by ice and it's easier to say blacky that's an easy volcano to pronounce yeah we're not  even attempting to that other one wow that's tough yeah that's too too big too big of a word for us 
[01:26:00]  sir uh so but locky's overdue too right uh well it's overdue these cycle times are measured in  centuries the last week was 1783 benjamin franklin was in paris by the way he saw the whole thing happen  the whole the skies darken uh it's called the year without summer the entire summer was knocked out  i hear his uh it lasted eight months i hear his plane was uh delayed coming back to the united states  also right that's right they were going to put his face on the money and they had to delay that flight 
[01:26:30]  yes yes indeed now uh the a lot of people stranded now i mean how long are these people going to  be stranded how long is this going to spew this much ash and debris into the atmosphere well it could  last days and weeks uh the best case scenario is if the ice mainly melts in which case the the eruption  is over ice aggravates the whole situation scientists are going there right now to try to  find out how much ice is left you see when molten lava goes through ice it causes explosions it cause  glassifying silica and that's what's aggravating this explosion because this explosion is actually a 
[01:27:00]  rather minor eruption as far as eruptions go once the ice is gone the eruption will be harmless so it's  like putting one of those frozen turkeys in the boiling oil look out yeah it's splattered you get  explosions yeah classification of silica and this this thing is like uh industrial grade sandpaper if it  goes into an engine it just chews up the engine uh melts re-solidifies gums up the blades and in 1982 
[01:27:30]  a plane almost went down when all four engines conked out when it went through a cloud like this oh wow  we don't like that that's pretty frightening so yeah you're and you know some people say why not fly  under the cloud well there's a danger there parts of the cloud were invisible and when it hits your  windshield it sand blasts your windshield i mean what is sandblasting after all yeah last thing is  taking industrial grade particles and slamming it into glass right and and stone that's what happens 
[01:28:00]  when an airplane goes through volcanic ash so you pretty much blind them you're blinded right one pilot  actually had to land an airplane by sticking his head outside the cockpit old school because his  windshield was sandblasted by volcanic ash wow and and now we got this uh this meteor that was seen  over um where was that wisconsin yeah midwest right it was a rather rather it's on the internet you can  see yeah very bright you know the impact lit up the sky i was very surprised at the length of time  that this thing was lit up they said uh they they started seeing it a good 15 minutes before it really 
[01:28:30]  came uh through the atmosphere and and really got bright that seems to be a long time for this thing  to be um heated up in the atmosphere well we do have a telescope in arizona it's the only one in the  world that is capable of actually seeing the meteor before it actually hits the ground it was successful  last year for the first time in history it actually recorded a meteorite a meteor as it hit the atmosphere 
[01:29:00]  then of course people on the ground saw it explode in the air and then people picked it up off the  ground it was in sudan so all three stages in outer space in the atmosphere and landing on the ground  all three stages were documented the first time in history just a few months ago how long would we have  advance notice for the theoretical planet killer um type uh asteroid or uh meteor um how how much uh  warning would we have that something that could be devastating to the planet is on its way well 
[01:29:30]  asteroids big ones are very easy to track because you go in circles around the sun the comets from  the orb cloud way way out there they're the most dangerous because as they approach the sun there they  have irregular orbits uh you know periodicity ten thousand years twenty thousand years and when they  approach the sun they have no tail because they're covered in soot once they go behind the sun then  the soot blows off sprouts the tail and then you got a few weeks warning before it kills you oh that's 
[01:30:00]  wonderful a few weeks warning before it kills you a few weeks huh wow that isn't enough time to do  anything considering we don't even have a shuttle program we've been brainwashed to think that the  space shuttle can reach a comet or asteroid wrong the space shuttle simply spins circles around the earth  very very low orbit go into deep space yeah low orbit um yeah is is there is there anything  that we have available on the planet right now that would be able to be used to defend against 
[01:30:30]  something like that uh we would have to use some of our planetary probes they can actually go into  deep space but it takes weeks and months and years to get some of these rockets assembled and  pointed in the right direction remember the the space shuttle can only go in circles around the earth  right you have to have one of our planetary probes that goes out to mars and places like that yeah  that would be a little too that would be a little too late if uh you know to get it in kind of low  earth orbit uh you'd have to attack that thing um while it's pretty far out there huh that's right 
[01:31:00]  you want to nudge it out of the way blowing it up like what bruce willis would want to do it's  the worst thing you want to do because then we get all these baby asteroids coming at you oh we can't  send a drilling team there to uh drill and put a uh atomic bomb in there huh yeah that's the worst  thing to do because you know these asteroids may be collections of rocks that are held together by  gravity so they may not even be solid and so by blowing it up you have lots of mini asteroids coming 
[01:31:30]  at you so what you'd have to do in essence is have some type of propulsion device to attach to this  thing and kind of push it uh out of the way well the cheapest way to deflect it is to simply paint  it shoot a rocket that simply spray paints you know like graffiti uh graffiti is the asteroid that  changes its absorption of sunlight causes a slight pressure because of sunlight pressure and nudges it  out of the way as it slowly whips around the sun almost like one of those uh light bulb looking 
[01:32:00]  things at the black and the white on each side and it spins around because uh the the black is  absorbing uh uh heat is that kind of that thing actually goes in the opposite direction it's the  heating of one one plate versus the other side that causes it to spin but yeah in general if you  caught if you paint an asteroid far far away it will absorb more energy and deflect it a bit you know  you could actually calculate ms-13 up there yo yeah no yeah that's spray paint it 
[01:32:30]  spray paint it i never even i never heard that one what about things like uh solar sails attached to  it yeah you can do that there have been a number of proposals another one is to actually use the  gravity as a tractor beam the gravity of a rocket ship to push it out of the way uh another ingenious  way is to shoot a laser beam at it which will vaporize the surface of the rock causing a jet and the  jet will then push the asteroid out of the way all right okay yeah the laser beams spray paint uh the 
[01:33:00]  gravity of a tractor beam rocket uh all of these have been looked at but they're all very expensive  and they're many many decades away and it would be uh yeah so we're sitting here pretty much  fighting our time hoping nothing happens until we do have the technology available uh that's wonderful  to work on that wow what do you think about the shuttle program ending there  well i'm not happy about it but you know we are in an economic crisis i just hope the russians don't  get um uppity and you know use an excuse in the balkans to shut off our space program yeah exactly i 
[01:33:30]  i find it kind of embarrassing that us as a country have no way of getting our astronauts up uh to a  space station that we really paid for right who would have thought who would have thought that after  all the billions spent on the race to the moon and yeah the russians that we wind up paying the russians  50 million per astronaut yeah 50 million per astronaut for access to out of space who would  have thought that i i think that's crazy and i i find it very uh disheartening as an american and um 
[01:34:00]  and just uh embarrassing that uh you know we all these cuts now especially in nasa it doesn't even look  like in the near future we're going to have a uh craft to take astronauts up there on our own yeah and  some people are saying that nasa is the agency to nowhere and the astronauts are astronauts to  nowhere i go where are they going to go now the recent press conference by obama did allay some fears  he finally said we're going to go someplace we're going to go to an asteroid in 2025 and maybe mars in 
[01:34:30]  the mid 2030s who knows for sure but you know some people are saying well where's where's the beef  okay you want to go there that's fine but where's the beef where's the money you know yeah i've always  just thought that um the space program here in this country has been a source of pride and a source  of uh new technology that that we've gotten that we use on a daily basis uh um from the space program  i mean i don't think you could go through a day without using numerous items that have been used 
[01:35:00]  uh on the space program and invented directly because of the space program and it's just a shame to uh  see something that's that important to our country um uh just go to the wayside yeah you know we are  uh so dependent on outer space uh telecommunications the internet gps weather satellites um all of that  goes through satellite technology and you know we take it for granted until there's a solar flare or 
[01:35:30]  something that is that is our satellites uh we take it for granted and the economy a good chunk of the  economy goes through outer space parts of this radio transmission yeah yeah yeah exactly and uh  yeah look hey we're just going to have to get used to the fact that after 2020 the chinese are going to  plant a flag on the moon saying that the chinese have gone to the moon okay if you're if you're okay  with that okay you're going to have to get used to it use to the fact that other nations are going to  leapfrog ahead hopefully obama will say something more definite about what he wants nasa to do yeah i think 
[01:36:00]  he just put a band-aid on everybody nowhere i think he was just putting a band-aid on everybody's uh  you know opinion of um his cuts i i i don't like it i and i think it does take away from from jobs and  new technology that um make new products that again makes new jobs and and i i think nasa is a very  important uh agency for our country and i i hate the fact that um we don't have a ship uh the budget's been 
[01:36:30]  cut and um yeah i don't know it's just it's embarrassing the problem is cost it costs ten  thousand dollars to put a pound of anything into near earth orbit that's your weight in you're out  going to be a fortune with near earth orbit to go on the space shuttle costs about 50 million to go on  the space just to go around the earth so it is expensive my personal point of view is that we should  look at non-chemical means of going into outer space oh now that's uh what like um what are you 
[01:37:00]  talking maybe magnetic rail firing us up there something even easier let's say you have a laser  rocket laser beam on the earth so you don't have to put the laser into space it's on the earth you  shoot a laser at a payload which contains water the water boils water is harmless and as it boils it  shoots out one and and only the payload goes into outer space why is space travel so expensive  because the chemical rocket has to put itself into outer space yes yeah and then and that's very uh 
[01:37:30]  yeah that's just the heaviest part god he just simplifies oh that's who wants to do one of those  pump up water rockets pretty much is what he's suggesting prototypes of this have been fired  successfully they're small prototypes but you can use ground-based lasers lasers on the ground which  do not have to go into outer space to energize water so it boils to shoot the payload just the  payload into outer space he loves his lasers small scale lasers dr kaku love his lasers going back to 
[01:38:00]  basics now unfortunately uh this guy didn't hear your 2012 discussion but basically uh michu kaku  saying the 2012 uh thing is all it's bunk right dr michu well you see the mayans did say something  about 2012 it's a day it's a time of celebration it's their new years but i think westerners have  hijacked hijacked the calendar for their own purposes in the mayan culture there's no history  of apocalypse that's a western concept in in the east and also in in uh these societies uh what they 
[01:38:30]  celebrate is the renewal the renewal of the seas is not the end of the world that's a western concept  being imposed upon an ancient mayan time of celebration they're supposed to celebrate in 2012.  there's so many yeah people love interpreting things and then spreading it around like it's fact  it's just because they make money on it think of all the books that have been written by 2012.  movies yeah big business 2012 people are making a lot of books anyone can write a book because 
[01:39:00]  anyone can say well the mayans meant this the mayans meant that but if you actually go to what the  mayans have they had a calendar that is cyclic and it's nothing but a new cycle but it makes for a  good copy you can make a lot of money saying that that's the end of the world now obviously uh 2012  bs uh what's the one thing we got to worry about as humans what's the next big thing you're you told  us last time a an earthquake taking out a city a major city tsunami a tsunami right yeah well if you take 
[01:39:30]  a look at disasters now okay um volcanic eruptions take place on the scale of centuries but earthquakes  you know we are overdue for a big one in california and tokyo and istanbul and so in our lifetime in our  lifetime we'll probably see one or more of these great cities reduced to near rubble uh and we're just  going to have to prepare for that fact another possibility now on a scale of centuries is a 
[01:40:00]  gigantic solar flare from the sun that wipes out all communications satellites and our power supply  like what happened in 1859 this is called the carrington event it was the largest solar flare ever  ever recorded because of course we didn't have electricity before yeah yeah we had telegraph wires  but you could read the newspaper at night in cuba because of the aurora borealis in cuba in 1859 
[01:40:30]  so this is unprecedented so that would be devastating because we know people if you take the technology  away for any length of time um we're going to revert back to being animals pretty quickly take a look at  electricity without electricity food rots you'd have food riots within three days and no rescue crews  from outside because they're paralyzed too with food riots governments could collapse uh and the 
[01:41:00]  physicists have estimated the damage of another carrington event and again we don't expect it to  happen for quite a while however it would be about two trillion dollars two trillion dollars  damage to the world economy if it knocks out power supplies transformers power stations simultaneously  and all satellites simultaneously going out because the sun has a temper tantrum  we are kind of at the mercy of uh nature you know this uh planet and uh the solar system and 
[01:41:30]  well we think we're so hot right yeah mother nature says huh you humans are beauty to what i can do  yeah you know it really is amazing sometimes when you get these cataclysmic events you realize how  actually small they are on a planetary scale but how devastating they are locally to the people that it  happens to and uh you realize yeah if something bigger would have happened um that could really  screw up uh civilization right and and some people think that maybe another mother nature is having 
[01:42:00]  revenge on us because we have all these earthquakes happening in a row now we have a gigantic volcanic  eruption but if you think about it earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen all the time mainly  underwater underwater oh yeah well forget that there's no cnn underwater there's no people to die  underwater but the earth erupts all the time with earth monster earthquakes monster volcanic eruptions  underwater that's only on the fish news and i don't get that uh on my cable network so it's not 
[01:42:30]  that we're having more earthquakes it's that they're happening uh in places where we care about yeah  yeah so what happens is you know we are encroaching on mother nature that's what's really happening  mother nature is not angry at us we are encroaching upon her you know back in 1821 when that volcano blew  up in iceland there were no transatlantic flights right and in 1783 uh benjamin franklin didn't mind being  stranded in paris because ships were unaffected by what was happening in the atmosphere and rumor has it he 
[01:43:00]  did like his women right so now we all encroaching on mother nature so we're going to we're going to  find more of these things we're going to have more earthquakes killing people more more encounters  with volcanoes because of progress because of progress because we have more technology that we  didn't have a hundred years ago wow and what about that yellowstone thing you mentioned one time on our  show is an earthquake under yellowstone well okay there is a monster super volcano under yellowstone 
[01:43:30]  we don't know when it's going to erupt it erupts on a scale of hundreds of thousands of years however  if you do go back you know about half a million years you find eruptions that are just cataclysmic  if it were to happen it would destroy the united states of america as we know it would just basically take  out the entire middle of america but again these eruptions take place on a scale of hundreds of thousands of  years not not hundreds of years not decades but hundreds of thousands of years it's very hard to 
[01:44:00]  predict there's also another super volcano in the canary islands if it collapses simultaneously it'll  create a landslide that'll push water into a tsunami the tsunami will then go across the pond called the  atlantic ocean and devastate boston new york washington dc or boswash as we call it  boswell so that is a doomsday scenario two doomsday scenarios yeah super volcanoes but again you know 
[01:44:30]  their cycle time is on a scale of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years yeah well yeah it's  like spinning the wheel though it's got to happen sometime yeah it's inevitable it's inevitable that  that yellowstone will blow up at some point and that's what's going to if you can simply put fast  forward on the videotape if fast forward look thousands of years in the future you'll see that  the guts of america will be taken out that's wonderful well dr kaku uh thank you again for  enlightening us and our listeners you're always more on the science channel of course sci-fi science on the 
[01:45:00]  science channel absolutely i love the show by the way i do i watch it all the time you're uh you're  very entertaining and uh very interesting um with the uh the subjects that you cover and and some of  those theories and everything i love it love dr kaku's show dr kaku when can we look forward to a  new season of sci-fi science oh well yeah we're filming it right now even as we speak we're in the  middle of filming the second season the second season debuts in uh fall of this year yes very 
[01:45:30]  cool it's the number one show on the science channel yeah it's fantastic you're beating out how it's made  that's it that's a tough that's a tough one to beat oh i like that one too yeah that's good  dr michu kaku always a pleasure thank you so much sir okay thank you all right there he goes dr michu  kaku dr michu kaku very interesting i love when we touch on like like you slip in a sexual thing  or a curse and he doesn't acknowledge it like it never happened he doesn't even hear it 
[01:46:00]  i was he hears everything else wormhole right i wanted to talk about ben franklin and how he  invented bifocals so he could lick a french girl's pussy and look at her tits just by looking up and  down he has such a horn dog dude reading had nothing to do with it that guy loved his french  chicks and he wanted to like be able to see the clit so he'd look down his nose and then he looks  up at the titties through the top part look at her eyes to see if she's enjoying it of course 
[01:46:30]  see if he has to make any adjustments ben was a horn dog that motherfucker writing love letters  yes across the ocean did he love his french pussy also uh yeah keith jay in niagara falls get jennifer  aniston to spread her legs at the meteor or the comet and the stink will repel the comet we'll deflect  it yeah right that'll be good fucking rogan's online whoa joe rogan.net on twitter what's up brother  gentlemen what's happening hello joe i'm still awake here in los angeles for some strange 
[01:47:00]  reason and i heard you guys were talking about twitter or about strike force rather well we're  also talking to dr michu kaku you ever get into him or what did i ever get into him yeah well no  he's got he's got some good shit to say man he would blow your mind i think we put him on the  phone with you last time that's right yeah yeah we talked to him remember we talked about i just  remembered life being seeded on earth from space and all kind of yeah yeah yeah yeah he's talking about  this volcano in iceland and uh that's scary shit dude the real scary one is the one in yellowstone 
[01:47:30]  there's a caldera volcano in yellowstone that's 600 fucking kilometers wide yeah he was just talking  about that one and how you know in time uh you know you don't know it could be thousands hundreds  thousands a million whatever it is but eventually that whole center is just going to explode out of  this country taking taking out most of the united states yeah it's a continent killer it blows up every  six to eight hundred thousand years and the last time it blew up with six hundred thousand years  all right let's fuckin wait we're way overdue kids uh we're we're overdue oh that's wonderful 
[01:48:00]  it's literally and they've had over two thousand earthquakes there since january can they just drill  a hole and vent it just fuckin pipe it into the ocean as i'm sure they've had two thousand earthquakes  since january in yellowstone more than that more than two thousand earthquakes since january there is that  normal um no no it's not oh good good thanks joe jesus just send rogan there to kick the volcano's  ass bro man uh and what's your take on the strike force thing i we all know what your take would be 
[01:48:30]  but um not not not good for the sport not good for strike force right oh well it's not bad it's good  people looking at it so anytime people are looking at things it's good for them because you know you know  they need ratings and everything but i heard you guys thought that it was fake yeah it kind of  something looked a little wwe about it definitely not fake no really i got a phone call from mayhem's  manager who's a good buddy of mine and mayhem's a good buddy of mine as well and uh they're really 
[01:49:00]  freaking out about it because they're worried the strike force isn't going to use mayhem anymore  and you know jason stepped into the octagon because he had a previous fight with jake shield it was a  real close decision and he felt like he didn't fight it to his best he wanted to challenge him to try to get a  rematch and so he picked a really shitty time to do it like right after the guy won had you know  the toughest fight of his career he got knocked down and really badly hurt in the first round there's  a lot of emotions going on and his whole team was there and of course everybody got in mayhem's face  and they started pushing and then a brawl broke out it was definitely not planned okay well that's 
[01:49:30]  good to know i'll take joe's word for it the announcers sound a bit fake man the announcers sound fake  the announcers are terrible yeah they're well that's good frank shamrock i think is good but  that the guy who's like they're just the sports guy gus whatever the fuck his name is yeah those  guys they're killing my ears it's it's fucking death he doesn't know anything about mma and i'm  listening to it and i'm like and he's saying like oh this this kind of stuff happens in mma  fucking when when have you ever yeah right should happen in the ufc ever it doesn't happen in mma it 
[01:50:00]  happens in unorganized bush league events where they don't control the fucking cage and they let  20 30 guys from the camp get in there and they let mayhem walk up and grab the mic you can't do  that in the ufc they have the cages locked up you can't get in there you can't just walk in the  middle of a fucking national broadcast on cbs and get on camera that's just bush league bullshit  that's the real problem is they let that happen and they let this brawl break out yeah that did seem  a little like uh irresponsible if you know like i was saying that's why i thought it was fake too it's 
[01:50:30]  like how does this happen how does this happen they're just really badly organized i have friends  that fight for those guys and they're they all complain they're it's very poorly organized there  it's very difficult to pull off what the ufc pulls off and make it look easy and these guys they see  all the money that's involved they say fuck it let's get in on this and so they throw a  fuckload of money at it and they try to put it together but it requires a lot of getting things  right and the ufc has gone through a lot of trial and error over you know over a fucking decade to figure 
[01:51:00]  it out yeah yeah obviously uh and it's true you watch uh you know ufc and you see a professional  um organization at work and you you assume that anyone can just do that and it doesn't work out  the ratings one thing you can never do it you can never let all those fucking psychos into the cage  after the fight you can't do that psychopath you're only supposed to have the coach the trainers like 
[01:51:30]  to deal with two cornermen and you know one support guy that's allowed into the octagon you're not  allowed to have ten fifteen fucking guys in there that's nonsense and when the decision's being  read they have fucking security at the side of the cage always you don't let just people just run in  there and fucking grab the mic go yo when am i going to get the fight you know that's that's  ridiculous pull the fucking kanye on the motherfucker you didn't need to let him  fucking enjoy his moment exactly at least he took on another man yeah exactly a little blonde hair 
[01:52:00]  girl right exactly strike force the ratings weren't kind for that strike force well you know they were  okay the real problem was that the show went way over they went over an hour over their allotted time  so they went right through the news they went a half an hour through the news and a half an hour into  csi so the only way that i got to watch it was that i was watching it live because i have friends  that set their tivos for it and they got fucked they didn't even get a chance to see the main event  oh wow that's not that's not smart programming at all no it's it's it's all bush league across the 
[01:52:30]  board the entire productions bush league right on hey uh what's what else is on your radar while  we have you on the phone joe anything i don't know i'm just wondering why i'm so awake  i know yeah really what the hell are you doing cleaning out my office i'm trying to uh i'm  organizing my office so i'm obsessed good luck with that yeah well i'm doing my weekly podcast  and i decided to turn my office into like some sort of a studio and so i've just been throwing  everything out and just cleaning it up very boring stuff dude your podcast is taking off man it's fun 
[01:53:00]  man i mean i started doing it because it's a goof and now it's like the number eight comedy podcast on  itunes and so uh now i'm actually putting effort into it yeah give it a try that's fine i mean  fuck you know i've wanted to do radio forever i always love it when i do your show and but it's  like you know to actually get a radio show is so goddamn fucking pain in the ass you know it's so  much fun to do but it's so difficult to pull off but what happened with what happened with our boys  talking to you oh we're going to do something i'm going to do something once a week for six weeks for 
[01:53:30]  them and we're going to do like a trial is he going to be on our channel hopefully hopefully it  better i don't know what that would be nice we got you guys together i mean joe rogan's perfect for  this serious i would love it perfect it on your channel that would be the shit that would be fun  that would rule and expect to be paid in the tens of dollars my friend that's right i'm  fucking fired up for that i told them i'd do it for free if i'd like to just put it on oh well why  would you do that the lid up there why would you do that because that's basically what they're  going to offer but but it's good i want to do all i'm doing it for is just to advertise gigs and to 
[01:54:00]  show them that i could do it and you know quid pro quo yeah it would just be so much fun to do  i mean i get so jealous every time i listen to you guys like it just sounds like so much fun you  can so do this oh hells yeah hells yeah all right mr rogan thank you well thanks for having me on i  just wanted to clear up the whole strike force mess it definitely wasn't fake and uh any questions that's  good you know coming from joe rogan i'll absolutely buy that and if you guys ever ever have any mma 
[01:54:30]  questions feel free to email me well the the wec thing uh happened that's this weekend i'm actually  commentating on that are you that that is going to be amazing yeah that's going to be a fun pay-per-view  the lighter guys are always the most fun and uh jose aldo and uriah favor is the main event and  that's uh that's a sick fight that have you never seen jose aldo he's probably one of the very best  pound for pound fighters in the world he's like a small anderson silver but he doesn't have all the  psychological issues that anderson has about like finishing fights yeah the the buzz on this fight 
[01:55:00]  is uh going through the roof so yeah yeah definitely it's pretty sick uriah favor is a bad motherfucker too  so it should be real interesting and uh aldo is a freak man he's like literally one of the best  brazilian jiu-jitsu guys in the world he's beaten like top-notch brazilian jiu-jitsu world champions in  straight grappling competitions but he's won like almost all of his fights by knockouts i mean he's  he's a incredible athlete really like a freak prospect and he's you know became the champion 
[01:55:30]  beating this guy mike brown who's the guy who beat uriah favor twice so it's it's a pretty  fucking intense fight now i'm confused why doesn't dana bring the lighter guys into the ufc well they  see what happens is they bought the wec and they have you know network obligations and all sorts of  other things you know they they own the wec as well as the uh the ufc and the wec is right now the air on  versus okay so you know they they really kind of can't do that as of right now but you know they 
[01:56:00]  can't just start okay the new weight classes who knows what's going to happen in the future i'm just  excited to be able to do commentary on these guys because i think they're under looked i think  they're probably some of the most exciting weight classes in the world yeah a lot of people are saying  that if you got an aldo fight i'm thinking man that would be great to be part of ufc pay-per-view you  move yeah you move those guys up want those guys to get more attention too because the wec just  doesn't have the same cachet you know it doesn't have the same value i don't know about the wec but  yeah that's the problem with the ufc now the brand is so huge that you know people just associate you 
[01:56:30]  know the the best fighters in the world with the ufc and you hear the wec and people just go well what  is that it's such a small percentage of people that actually know which really sucks because some of the  fighters are fucking incredible i mean they've got a a bunch of great great fighters over there  well this uh pay-per-view this weekend is going to help that so get a little more exposure for  the wec all right i'm going to sleep yeah thank you joe joe rogan dot now twitter man follow  thanks joe thank you gentlemen later all right joe rogan rogan rules i think we just talked for 
[01:57:00]  an hour and a fucking guy the fucking guy oh yeah it's breaky time breaky breaky wakey wakey  i agree with brian ellen florida what he goes stop talking in kilometers we don't live in europe  dickheads who's talking in k uh i think i think uh kilometers came up in the discussion with dr  michu kaku and maybe with uh joe rogan too but i'm not sure kilometers like 600 kilometers or 600 
[01:57:30]  i don't know i don't know how many miles is that metric didn't take off here except for uh leaders  barely oh yeah beer and if you listen to um i'll tell a movie without the informant he goes into a  little thing about why leaders because it just sounds better than court court court leader like  you wouldn't buy a quart of of soda i want a quart of cola i want a liter of cola 
[01:58:00]  just get a large farva i don't want a large farva  i love that goddamn burger punks  i almost read it informant yeah it's good right yeah i liked it i thought it was good i went bottle  rocket instead it's funny and then there's some little twisties in it so it's all right i'm gonna  it's kind of cool i didn't mind it i went bottle rocket though did you yeah yeah great little  fucking movie put the wilson brothers on the map oh yeah i did see that one yeah with the it's a  little wes anderson flick yeah i saw that one a while very good a few movies this weekend but um 
[01:58:30]  remember this special remember this from intervention we played it last week  i still love you 
[01:59:00]  dude that video is because he's just sitting there  mm-hmm it's all straight-faced and then he goes  just out of nowhere that fucking scream well that rules i don't know if it's going to take  off but we got our first fucking remix oh derek uh d-boy came up with this yeah i do believe this  is a d-boy creation is he unhappy that kick-ass is doing well because i think that's a i think  it is lionscape it is lionscape find out he's not happy he can't be happy that kick-ass is doing 
[01:59:30]  well not a successful lionsgate movie no he can't be happy no but derek  d-boy aka d-boy came up with this  god damn so simple but so good i fucking love that 
[02:00:00]  d-boy love you yes yes gas is doing well and that's a lionscape movie yeah what's your thoughts  it'll fall off after this weekend you think yeah i was thinking it's going the other way  take off or level off it's gonna have it's like the watchman it's one of those comic book like fan  things when they all come out the first weekend and then it just drops off the next weekend you  hope so right fucking lions it looks awful i don't i don't see like well people that haven't seen it 
[02:00:30]  liked it if there's something about a kid you know yeah cursing and getting punched in the  face that's kind of funny people yeah a little 11 year old girl gets punched in the face she's  cursing something like that 20 million just under 20 million yeah and it lost to a film that was  on the charts for how many weeks four weeks oh which would it lose to the dragon something you're  dragging you know what though that's one of those just that's a g-rated animated film everyone goes  to those four weeks though yeah but it's tough to see an r-rated comedy open at number one 
[02:01:00]  i don't care who it's aimed towards good point difficult r-rated movies are tough as far as  getting the number one ranking for the weekend d ross tops d-boy right there take that blair monster  blair monster see you next week oh what's trap dog have to say about this i love the names around  this place i love how people on facebook are now calling me trap dog why wouldn't they and why  would you fucking trap dog then why would you acknowledge it on the show which is just gonna make  it worse no it never makes it worse no it won't make it worse don't worry trap dog all right 
[02:01:30]  hey uh hope your habs win trap dog caps all the way have dog why are they called the habs again  habitants the habitants yeah see now ant knows everything thank god i know that now i could hate  it more i'm not even following that series are the habs doing good it's one one one one one right  now you know it's terrible though wait you're a habs fan too caps oh yeah when the habs lost travis went  ovechkin you like the ovechkin i love them love green you got salmon you got all of them i don't 
[02:02:00]  know i only know ovechkin as far as the caps go dude they're doing a stack this year a lot of people  saying they should win it all this year d-boy hopefully we'll see what happens be the first  in team history too damn yeah never won a stanley cup derek's a fairweather fan though because i'm not  a fairweather fan i am not halfway halfway through the game on saturday he texts me he says i'm done  with this and then he tells me this morning he just threw off his jersey and stopped watching  they were down by three goals but that is a definition of a fairweather fan yeah i didn't 
[02:02:30]  want to see him get clobbered but you took your jersey off yeah he threw it on the ground and stomped  on it and it wants the mets i also love i also love good yeah all of a sudden three weeks ago  fucking blair monster shows up with a brand new uh brand new pristine yankee set and just decides that this  year he's going to be a yankees better at the beginning of the season my friend hey listen my  whole family's from jersey i'm the only one born outside of jersey i've been living here for the  last eight years have you ever won a yankee set ever ever in the five years that i've known you no 
[02:03:00]  never one now yes you know why because he's tired of his team losing so he's switching teams i'm  tired of baltimore being a shitty baseball team why can't you switch games you grew up a baltimore  orioles fan yeah oh my god i haven't won anything since 1983 i was born i know it's like the worst  thing that is so bad it was the year i was born the last time they won a world series i thought you  were just maybe a casual fan trying to and decided to step it up hang in there for what they're two  and ten you know he turned his back on in ten years he's still a yankee fan hardcore is he still 
[02:03:30]  fairweather back you got to start somewhere he'll stop being a yankee fan when they stop winning  derek welcome thank you to the family oh that is so bad that i didn't realize baltimore stinks  as long as an angelos and also they're not going anywhere derek's been a fucking uh a redskins  fan for his entire life and this year he decided now he's going to be an eagles  that's fantastic you ripped off your caps jersey because they were losing dude every year 
[02:04:00]  that is a great idea though every year you just switched well we talked about that  the winning team man why why can't we be why can't we be free agents you shouldn't be welcoming  him to the to the family because you know you get shit for your yankees i know because of of people  like him like d-boy who just decide to jump on the train whenever the you know whenever i've slowly  started to become a yankees fan the entire eight years i've been living up here so gradually i've 
[02:04:30]  it's hard not to over it's hard not to especially when they're on every day you're on  south jersey yankees great to watch and it's not even your secondary team because when i lived in  western new york i i took a peek at you know buffalo sports because i was up there but they were still  my secondary secondary team yeah you said fuck that i said yeah secondary team was the nationals  you had a national that is so great the nationals weren't around like when i became a fan of baltimore  what happens they weren't around last year what happens if the orioles completely turn around and  become this amazing team starting next year or two years down the road then what happens they won't until 
[02:05:00]  he sells that team they're not going to do it okay see i don't know i don't know the insides uh  inside they suck a dick yeah they really suck a dick all right so you all right so next year  you're a caps fan a yankees fan and an eagles fan no i'm back to i'm back to washington this year  oh yeah you don't have a choice before they got me now  he burned his redskins jersey last year hey we got derrick in staten island he has a comment about kick-ass  derrick hey guys how you doing listen i saw kick-ass twice this weekend best movie ever seen 
[02:05:30]  in my life you have an 11 year old because he's in love you have an 11 year old saying cunt hey dude  just because you're in the movie doesn't mean it's really good listen i might have a bad voice but that  movie was great how was the purple wig to wear that it was pretty damn good you know i mean dude  for an 11 year old she was hot she are you a fan of the comic yeah i'm a big fan of the comic  man but the only problem was is when the movie they were writing the movie it took forever for 
[02:06:00]  the uh comics to come out then i just want to scream now at people all right derek thank you  all right thanks a lot guys and thanks to d-boy the fairweather fan yes d-boy back to your  fucking room where you do god knows what he pumps out brilliant brilliant stuff in there but who knows  what he's doing on on this off time pornography pornography very proud anthony speaking of d-boy  speaking of kick-ass and by the way uh quickly what d-boy is one of the most fun people to have at a 
[02:06:30]  party he's just hysterical drinks goofs on shit laughs out of nowhere derek's a strange fellow because  like we drug we dragged him out to aunt's house one night this i think like last summer and like the  bar was there like there's kegs of beer there's you know uh there's booze as far as the eye can  see and in the fridge there's bottled beer if you don't want the tap beer so what does this kid do  he brings a 12-pack and some ice and sits there yeah oh my god old school old school he had a 12-pack 
[02:07:00]  in a case that you'd have normally have like a case of beer so he put the 12-pack in there  and just threw ice all on top of it made his own like ghetto cooler yeah yeah and he just  sit and leans back pops another one i thought that he had passed out or whatever so all of a sudden  it was like where where derek goes like oh i guess you went to sleep or whatever then he just appears  like like an hour and a half later it's like where were you you went you fell asleep he's like no  i was playing call of duty yeah he just goes and plays call of duty plays call it comes back did he  bring a six-pack of uh shitty beer old school and then take someone's good beer no he brought beer he 
[02:07:30]  likes i forgot what it was but yeah he's like a mike he's a real big micro-brew guy yeah micro-brew guy i think he  didn't like the commercialism of the bud light probably uh this just in d-boy is now officially  working for howard stern see because he has to move on to okay yeah see glad he was a fairweather  oh oh oh so he's oh that wasn't 
[02:08:00]  hey anthony bob kelly this is from january 7th so we're talking uh what a little over three months  ago yeah bob kelly was on this show talking about that movie kick-ass now no one at the time no one  knew about kick-ass i think i think the first trailer hit movie theaters whatever it was just starting  uh to to pop on people's radar three months ago the movie just came out okay and bob kelly uh brought  to our show uh his thoughts on kick-ass yeah and we just beat the living shit out of him and listen to 
[02:08:30]  this i'll tell you what movie's going to be the best the best movie coming out that is going to  bring nick cage's career back danny type in um ass kiss or something like that uh look that's funny  enough that he didn't even know the name of the movie uh ass kiss well it's from three months ago but  how about it shows a picture of him and dane cook  uh ask uh ask no ass kick it's kick ass kick ass kick ass kick kick ass and then um let me wait 
[02:09:00]  till you see this clip this thing is insane yeah that's it right there i don't believe you i'll  tell you right now yeah see the trailer but see the uh the girl trailer let me tell you what it ain't  happening it certainly ain't happening bobby's bobby's just too excited about it yeah he's building it up and  it's gonna suck no one cares it's gonna the movie's gonna flop and bob's gonna be all alone trying  to still convince us it's good we're just you bring him back at this point it's over there still trying 
[02:09:30]  to find it it's gonna bring back his career he's up helping danny find it all you have to do is  it's a comedy about superheroes  this is a comedy about superheroes we're back live this is from three months ago yeah so i do remember  this we we watched the scene from the movie and not a reaction from any of us no no  no okay kid cursing  it's a little kid 
[02:10:00]  all right okay you can't  i'm that girl  you can't have a kid say  why  all right just never heard that before it's not real yeah that's real from lions uh gate by the way  what is that that girl can't be um i'm boggled that they let it a kid it's about speak like  even nick cage is a superhero too he's like a batman type guy yeah and i love nick cage all the 
[02:10:30]  fucking all the bat all the um all the uh kids are superheroes but then they don't have  speechless after that trailer  because i don't i don't want to hurt my friends enthusiasm  for that horse manure you don't think that movie would be funny it can eat ass that little  girl can blow me since she's saying cunt so much it it can eat dick you don't like that movie 
[02:11:00]  but i didn't see the movie no one likes that movie it'll it'll make six point eight thousand  dollars at the box office i'll bet you right now that movie is a fucking who'll go see it  blockbuster it can't be oh why not because the little girl said cunt rated r movies can't be  they will not allow that to happen there's no such thing as a rated r blockbuster you know what i bet  you that scene is not even in the movie when it comes out really it's gonna hurt the box office yeah  you think yeah it'll be one of those things to get rid of nicholas cage they had to pay him 20 mil 
[02:11:30]  the girl four dollars it did they four dollars it's the movie will make 40 million are you out of  your mind we don't know shit no we don't the scene was only terrible and and the movie is doing very  well yeah yeah it's uh 20 million just under 20 million for the first weekend and there was a lot of  confusion as to what type of movie this was we talked about this earlier a lot of people think  it's kind of a kid movie is it a comedy is an action film it's rated r and parents were taking 
[02:12:00]  their kids to it over the weekend thinking it's some fun kid superhero movie and meanwhile it's  ultra violent putty mouth language out of children one more clip final thoughts this is from january 7th  of this year i hate nicholas cage me and patrice have had a thing going for a few minutes here  the enthusiasm comment really just bummed me out about bobby because you're so right you don't  want to crush his enthusiasm for liking a kid movie i don't even know what to do with that that's

[02:27:00]  mammal you want a mammal uh and it's got to be small enough where it's not gonna hurt you and you  don't want to use a stepladder or anything like that no you want to be you know what you do what  you do with a uh a sheep i heard this um the boots you put you put the back legs of the sheep right  in boots right but then you got to be near some kind of a thing the sheep doesn't want to go in a  cliff or something or a lake or something so it backs up and and when you push forward the sheep 
[02:27:30]  automatically pushes back on you like they're enjoying it and then you get a good uh sheep uh  fucking out of that you gotta you gotta fake the sheep into enjoying it yeah yeah they'd rather  back into a cock than go into water or over a cliff so you gotta beat that's good you gotta use  your mind not only do we have opposable thumbs but we have a divine spark in our head opi and that  lets us well fuck sheep well jason's gonna give us a little info on the sheep thing it might not  be the best one yes really jason jason yeah yeah what's up guys what you got on the sheep thing 
[02:28:00]  yeah um when sheep especially when like you know they're going to be given birth they're  very tend to prolapsing and it's more than just you know your average female pink sock in a porno  it looks like the entire uterus comes out wow they're very prone to prolapse really they even  make a device that prevents it don't we call that pink socking pink sock yeah yeah can we keep it  medical here please so they're gonna it's pink sock it's pink socking so you're saying if a human had  sex with a sheep they'd probably pink sock uh it's possible especially if that he's uh they 
[02:28:30]  think you're like having sex with an intestine or something yeah that's not good all right i might  have to pass on the sheep thing i'd have to switch to a pig chris s from redding pennsylvania the  kardashians love to fuck animals so wow jesus yeah my goodness i didn't i did not know that uh i did not  know that bring up some pictures search search uh sheep prolapsing i'll take your word for the  for uh i'll take your word on that one i i rarely say this thank god danny is out of the studio yeah 
[02:29:00]  i don't want to because he would pop sheep prolapse up and you'd see it within seconds what's weird  usually when we start a topic the phones are lit i don't think anyone wants to be involved no one  really wants to jump on the bandwagon of what animal come on people what animal would you  fuck we're playing if you had to relax everybody relax god it's easy just relax take it all in  soon as the game's called if you had to it's safe for everybody if it's if you had to someone a loved  one is is has a knife to their throat what child no you have to what child you have to that's the 
[02:29:30]  whole thing but your loved one has a knife to their throat they're being hung over a cliff there's  things happening but you in order to save your loved one's life you have to have sex with a  certain animal i would say i'd still go with sheep even though there's a prolapse threat  you figured it out uh pizza guy is saying ashley dupree all right what happened that was kind of a 
[02:30:00]  good joke an animal don't worry pizza guy i'm with you that's funny what happened here's uh larry  king singing with snoop dogg and then we'll get into the bestiality farm in a second oh start  spreading the news i'm leaving today yeah come on i want to be a part of it come on new york oh my god  come on i want to wake up in a city that never sleeps come on i'm playing on you  i'm following your lead i'm your background but you ain't doing nothing you're hanging

[02:32:00]  fuck a porpoise strictly because it does it's already wet it's got a hole on top and it's ready  to go i mean you can tell he's just swimming around there just asking for it every day  a porpoise where where do you where do you have a porpoise does anyone know for for sure there's  some danger there because you're in the water and the thing could fucking pull you under i like  i'm in sea world and i'm going to get taken under i would definitely you know get right on top of it  the problem with the porpoises you can't you can't there's no hips to hold on right they slide right 
[02:32:30]  away from you you're not going to get anything done and they're very slippery without it without  hips to hold on to uh and i think and i think all that and i think everything kind of comes to a  point in a porpoise in the back end right yeah yeah so you know they're sliding away even more  and you got to be underneath right like you can't fucking doggy style a porpoise  no you can't tell the fans and everything can't tell the porpoise to put its uh ass up in the air  no how's that ass up get that ass i'll smack that fucking ass yeah but you can't doggy style

[02:45:00]  he now sits in the whatcom county jail on three counts of cruelty to animals in the form of bestiality  i'm shocked kelly and ron mcdonald had no idea such activity was happening on their rural road but  say there always seemed to be traffic yeah there's a lot of trucks up and down and but uh we we didn't  know anything about that you can't figure it out yeah they're not going to pick fucking pumpkins you  dummies a lot of trucks a lot of trucks that figures yeah you can truckers you got that purdy you got that 
[02:45:30]  purdy sheep that i was with last week beastforum.com why don't we try that there travis beastforum all right  that might um let's try beastforum.com oh my god remember and keep it clean my sister's listening  today keep it clean keep it clean like um here's part two of the story we don't know how  u.s probation officers raided the compound looking for this man douglas spink is suspected of running 
[02:46:00]  the operation and maintaining a website displaying home video of sexual abuse against animals spink a  once millionaire businessman was on parole for felony drug charges from 2005. he was convicted of  transporting hundreds of pounds of cocaine through snohomish county and served three years you think  you've seen it all in 36 years but whatcom county sheriff bill elfo says dozens of horses and dogs were  seized from the compound some so injured they had to be euthanized very easy shows there's something new 
[02:46:30]  that even is shocking to the law enforcement no it's not just stop it come on anytime they go you  know this this is i've been on the job 20 years but this is this is the worst thing i've ever seen  it's no probably isn't that's horrible you probably looked you laughed laughing at the people arresting  the guy laughing at him well making jokes about the poor fucking horse what didn't make the news story 
[02:47:00]  because it's so horrific yeah terrific you mean horrific you know what i'm gonna okay uh well  i'll read i'll read and we'll get to the horrific part so the convicted cocaine smugger been arrested  for running okay twisted sex acts uh with animals douglas spink was arrested as heavily wooded compound  near the canadian border along with a 51 year old tourist okay we got all that dozens of dogs horses and  pet mice were seized see they didn't mention the mice anthony oh we all know what those are for 
[02:47:30]  the old richard gear this stuff is just truly bizarre he said listen to this these were mice  that had their tails cut off they were smothered and vaseline and they had string tied around them  ah in hindsight lighting the match was a bad idea remember that one that one started like that of  course that was the first line of the one where the guy lights the uh match and in hindsight lighting  the match and and it was supposed to be an associated press uh release right and they're graphically 
[02:48:00]  talking about shoving rodents in men's assholes yeah it's such an urban myth this guy spank he had a  website right calls his operation exit exit point stallions limit t and expounds at length on its website  about his philosophy his philosophy is this it's my philosophy marty are we unconventional in our  approach to stallion care absolutely he writes he later adds we don't wall off sexual energy in 
[02:48:30]  our stallions as something dangerous or inappropriate but rather channel that energy toward positive safe  appropriate paths there's a proper time and place for it and we work towards those uh sorts of skills  rather than fighting unwinnable fights against deeply rooted instincts this makes no sense exactly this makes  no sense trying to justify the fact that people coming from all over the world to fuck his animals  god that's unbelievable i don't know if this beast forum website is serious why that just some of the 
[02:49:00]  threads that that i'm that i'm reading dogs versus horses uh bump if you've had sex with your dog  which uh in message boards you know you you bump the thread back up to the top okay uh how did your  parents take it i guess there's a whole thread they found out yeah but about that then there's a uh  then there's a poll uh biggest bestiality fantasy oh and what are the well here's your choices all

[02:52:30]  you were actually fucking horses instead of just talking about fucking horses yeah you used to  fuck a lot more horses back in the day they were so much better when they were fucking horses there you  go stallion penis tastes great but it's incredibly hard to get a stallion off with oral attention  semen tastes okay but it's pretty strong not something i enjoy now pre on the other hand  is the nectar of the gods he did not write that's from pony stud 08 okay holy 
[02:53:00]  shit your statement of big fat horse is a little oblique do you mean big fat  horse or big fat horse penis this is the asshole of the website literal guy he's got over 3000 posts  of course he does uh i would be more than happy to suck a meaty equine sexual rod but it's sad only  10 stallion can be brought to orgasm by oral stimulation it's sad huh what only one out of

[03:05:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  All right. 
[03:06:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Where is it?  What was that?  Where is it?  I remember that.  What was that?  Are you asking?  Do you honestly want an answer?  Because I'll tell you what it was. 
[03:07:00]  What was that?  We should wait for Norton.  He'll be here tomorrow.  That's true.  That'll be played tomorrow.  The rest of that will be played tomorrow.  All right.  You want to get your bus tire-proof suit on?  Is that what you want to do?  That will be played tomorrow on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man, looking back sometimes sucks, man.  Yeah.  Because I remember...  Ah, whatever.  I'll get into it tomorrow.  I remember that being like, all right.  It's rocking.  All right.  This is all right. 
[03:07:30]  Oh.  What?  Let's see.  This is what was in yesterday's newspaper.  It was in yesterday's paper?  It was in yesterday's Daily News.  What does it say, Ant?  Let's see.  Penthouse Pet of the Year, Taylor, yes, they're real vixen, brought her poultry-tude to SiriusXM's Opie and Anthony show last week. 
[03:08:00]  What's a poultry-tude?  Tits.  Is that an attitude or is that her big boobies?  Poultry-tude.  Poultry-tude.  I think that's going to be an attitude.  I think it's something to do with a chicken.  Poultry-tude.  What is it?  Beautiful.  Ah.  Why don't they just write beautiful?  Yeah.  Fuck. 
[03:08:30]  Why?  Why?  I don't know all the sources.  Brought her poultry-tude to SiriusXM's Opie and Anthony show last week.  Co-host Anthony Cumia didn't miss his shot at taking her out.  Vixen, she claims that's her real name.  Agreed.  It's not.  Agreed.  Since she comes from Texas where she winked, we love meat.  Anthony took her to the Brazilian steakhouse, Plataforma. 
[03:09:00]  And later to Beer Garden in the Meatpacking District.  Wait, that's not how you spell beer.  I know.  They spell it fancy.  Beer like that.  It's a German spelling.  Ah.  J-E-W, Garden.  Jesus.  In the Meatpacking District.  Let's hope the date went better than Anthony's hookup with Playboy model turned traffic reporter  Jill Nicolini when Nicolini found a 20-year-old blonde hiding in Anthony's closet, she ran 
[03:09:30]  to his barbecue grill, not with meat, but with the girl's clothes.  Ha-da-ha.  Oh, why does that keep getting brought off, Ray Lynn?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hey, you made the papers down here.  Ha-ha-ha.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That old gag.  Um, well, you know, look at me.  I did.  I went through Playboy, Penthouse, and now I just need Swank. 
[03:10:00]  A Swank.  And you said Biggins, but I don't want Biggins.  Well, Biggins.  Biggins would be good.  Oh, poor Ray Lynn.  Look at...  James in Maryland.  James.  Oh, what?  Good morning, boys.  What's up, James?  Anthony, did you see the Chris Matthews program yesterday?  No.  Okay, I hope you're buckled in, because they said that the Tea Party movement, with all the  colorful language that they've used to describe the health care bill, the immigration bill, 
[03:10:30]  and everything else, they had this Joe Klein guy from Time Magazine, this John Holloman  guy from Atlantic Monthly, that they would be causing a terrorist incident in the United  States by the fall 2012 elections.  Now, this is bullshit.  We had talked briefly, way back when, about Canadian health care.  It was funny, they even had this chicken on there from NBC, talking that Obama is very 
[03:11:00]  concerned.  That, and we wanted a Fios update.  So, have a great show.  Oh, Fios update.  Yes, I haven't given my weekly Fios update.  Yeah, I think some of the rhetoric that's coming from the left now, and from Obama's camp, and  from Clinton, and stuff, they're trying to fight back by saying that this is dangerous  speech, that people like Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity, and Glenn Beck are saying things, 
[03:11:30]  and Sarah Palin, are saying things that are inciting Americans, that are just echoing with the  hard, right, really crazy people on the far right.  And meanwhile, it's being shown through numerous polls from numerous organizations and stuff,  that, no, this is pretty much real people that are just sick of being taxed up the ass, 
[03:12:00]  and they're going out and showing their dissatisfaction with it, and they will show their dissatisfaction  in November for the elections, and now they're trying to turn it around there.  They always try to, like, do what the other side's doing, and it never works.  Like, the liberal radio thing just doesn't take off like conservative radio does, and right-wing  talk shows.  Fox News is blowing away CNN.  CNN, there's just something about conservative, Republican-based, right-wing, whatever you 
[03:12:30]  want to call it, as opposed to liberal left, that is, for some reason, more entertaining.  Whatever it is.  It might be stupid as hell, it might not work, but for some reason, people are just more  entertained by it, and kind of want to hear it more.  What is it going to lead to, though, this Tea Party movement?  Uh, it, it, it, hopefully, it'll lead to a Republican-run, uh, House and Senate.  Well, that's what you're saying.  But, well, that'll equal everything out, and keep Obama from being able to do whatever the  fuck you damn well pleases. 
[03:13:00]  What's the worst-case scenario?  Revolution?  Worst-case scenario, for me, would be that it breaks up, um, the party, uh, in a way where  it takes votes away, and the Democrats keep their seats.  But can it, uh, lead to...  Revolution?  No, not in this fucking country, not in this country, no way, not ready for a revolution  here.  No one wants to give up what they do have.  You say you want a revolution?  You say you want a revolution.  Uh, yeah, so it's just, um, it's ridiculous, each side now is finger-pointing, and, uh, the 
[03:13:30]  bottom line is, we'll see in November, if people, if people are satisfied and happy with  the way Congress and Obama have been doing business, they will keep their jobs.  If not, they will lose their jobs.  That's the real litmus test here.  Uh, so we won't really know.  You hear rhetoric from both sides.  No one really knows until, uh, this happens.  And so, and Fios kicks fucking ass!  I love it!  Holy shit!  Not one glitch.  It's been great. 
[03:14:00]  My internet works perfectly.  Uh, Johnny, uh, A from New Orleans writes, someone please tell Ant that polls are bullshit,  and stop quoting them.  It makes him sound dumb and uninformed.  Yeah, that's right, because no one quotes polls, you dumb fuck.  Shut up!  Dumb and uninformed.  And I take multiple sources for polls.  Oh, I bet, you know what, though?  I bet if I took a lefty poll, uh, results, you'd love that.  Look, a lot of polls are coming out and saying more people are dissatisfied with what Obama  and the Democrats have done than are satisfied. 
[03:14:30]  Uh, find me a poll that doesn't say that.  That isn't run by some fucking lefty shit.  I'm talking polls that are legit.  Not the poll on fox.com or cnn.com.  Don't tell me.  You're uninformed.  You're a fucking dickhead.  Don't blow your father.  Fucking asshole.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's wonderful.  Thank you.  All right, hey, remember that British soccer show?  Remember when I say I have an opinion, and I just let it out there, and some asshole 
[03:15:00]  doesn't just have an opposing opinion and argue me on that, just says that I'm an asshole  that is uninformed.  Like, no, he calls you dumb.  Yeah, yeah, dumb, things like that.  You're a fucking idiot.  How about coming up with a counterpoint, then?  Show me a stat from the other side of the argument, okay?  While you're blowing your father.  Whoa!  Whoa!  And tonguing his fucking puckered ass.  Whoa!  As he groans. 
[03:15:30]  It doesn't have to go there.  Comes on a cracker.  Whoa!  You eat it.  That's schoolyard shit.  Yeah, of course it is.  Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.  I'm just going to say nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.  And I don't think you're dumb and uninformed.  No, thank you.  But didn't you talk about on the show about how polls are always slanted?  I said some polls are slanted.  Mine goes a little to the left.  What up, what up, what up?  No.  Some polls are very slanted and worded poorly as to make you think it's one thing when it's 
[03:16:00]  actually another or it's not a big sample.  Just things like that.  But some polls are as accurate as you're going to get with polling.  It's polling.  That's all I'm talking about, dummy.  Let's say hi to Jason in Kentucky.  Jason.  Jason.  Very good call.  Thanks, Jason.  In Kentucky.  Jason!  Yeah.  Yeah, you're on the air.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  I'm waiting for you. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, sorry.  I can barely hear you.  The whole New York City Tea Party was broadcast on Sirius.  Oh, yeah?  And what happened?  It was, they did it live and they did it, they had replays over the weekend of it.  It was actually kind of funny.  They had some of the, some of the newspapers were being, were delivered and they were actually  reading newspaper headlines about the Tea Party while they were doing the Tea Party  broadcast.  Well, you know what?  We had a countdown on our channel over the weekend. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, we were doing a countdown.  That's right.  That's right.  What channel had the Tea Party thing?  Posts?  It was on Sirius Patriot, whatever.  Patriot.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  Something no one listens to.  I don't know.  Andrew Wilkow was one, had one that.  What the hell is that?  I wouldn't have had it.  Do you know what that's about?  I've never heard of it.  No, I've heard of it.  I've never listened.  I, uh, yeah, they have Patriot.  Yeah, it's, it's, you should actually check it out. 
[03:17:30]  I don't know.  One of the times, one of the times you have one of your, one of your left guys in, maybe  see if Wilkow will come in and debate him.  I don't want to check it out.  There's too much good music to check out on Sirius X.  Yeah.  You know.  I don't like listening to talk all the time.  I hate talk radio.  Sometimes I listen to, uh, musica.  Musica.  Musica.  Musica.  Musica.  Uh, let's go to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim.  Tim.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, there.  Um, I just was, uh, that guy who just texted in about the polls and all that. 
[03:18:00]  Like, where does he get his information if not from polls that he just likes?  Like, what information pool is he accessing that we don't know about?  Do you understand the election is just a poll?  You know, the whole, the whole fucking process is the, is polling.  It's just, you're polling people.  It's just a matter of, yeah, a smaller sample or a demographic.  I know some statistics. 
[03:18:30]  Fuck dick.  You're not, you're not pulling the wool over my eyes.  Huh?  Um, whether it is what Democrats always do, like, no, but whatever you're saying, because  they don't like it, they'll refute it with nothing.  They'll just, but what they'll say is that you're immature, you're an idiot, everything  you're saying is dumb, but their side is literally either the same thing or just nothing.  They just make it sound like you're an idiot somehow.  Yeah, I've heard both sides just sound like assholes by criticizing the other side for 
[03:19:00]  doing the same thing they were doing.  So, it's ridiculous.  It really is.  Yeah, but, uh, so I call it sad.  But, uh, but thanks, uh, thanks a lot.  All I know are people are dissatisfied.  Some people.  There's a larger group of dissatisfied people, according to numerous polls, than there are  satisfied people.  Do you like polls or hate polls?  Uh, it all, like I said, it all depends.  Uh, some poll, I love a good poll.  Oh, do I love a good poll. 
[03:19:30]  Good poll is grown.  Good, yeah, thank you.  Got me out of that jam.  I'm sorry.  I, I decided to help you out that way.  I built me out from under the bus.  Why don't we do the British soccer show prank that we've been teasing for about, about a  week.  Hooligans.  Caller got through and complimented, uh, the host on his poll.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Good evening to you, Simon.  Calling from Leicester.  Good evening.  You all right there, Gary?  You all right, Paul?  Nice, sir.  All right, Simon.  Uh, firstly, can I just congratulate Gary on the size of his borg? 
[03:20:00]  On the what?  The size of his borg.  It seems like he's got a massive borg.  Oh, that's terrible.  And you should not have called in to discuss such things.  He's obviously just a very jealous man sat at home.  There we are.  Why would she say that's terrible?  It's because she's the fucking English Hall.  Wow.  Hello, I'm out, guys.  Oh, stop it, guys.  It made the show interesting.  Why is that terrible?  No, no.  Oh, no.  Stop it. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, I made it funny.  Your borg.  I wanted to congratulate you on the size of your borg.  The borg.  The borg.  Come on, it lightens up the show a little bit.  Of course.  Boring soccer show.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, boys?  I nigh.  My borg.  Yes.  Polls are bullshit because they should be two-sided.  It should be, okay, is Obama doing a good job? 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  All right.  Why?  What did he do?  Or whomever.  Well, that's not really a poll.  That's not really a poll.  That's kind of a questionnaire.  A poll is a number.  There's a question, and then people give an answer, and then there's a percentage of the  people that gave a certain answer.  That's a poll.  Yeah, but any idiot can say, oh, yeah, he's doing great. 
[03:21:30]  Why?  Yeah, it could.  Well, that's just it.  You have to take a big enough and random enough sampling of people that you're getting the  most accurate poll you can get.  Not, you know, it's not foolproof, but you can't.  Like, when I see Fox go, our Fox News poll tonight is, and here's the question, is Obama  a complete asshole?  And 99% of the people said yes.  That doesn't mean 99% of America thinks he's an asshole. 
[03:22:00]  I even know that.  It means that Fox News draws a lot of people that don't like Obama.  And when CNN does a poll, it's the same thing.  The CNN poll, or Newsday, or the Daily News, whatever, whenever one organization is using  their own demographic to do a poll, it's not going to be accurate, because it's going  to be skewed as to what the politics or feel or listenership or readership of whatever it  is draws in.  But if you have a poll like the Quinnipiac poll, that is a poll that takes people that canvass 
[03:22:30]  an area, get an equal demographic, and it doesn't have any, it doesn't really have a, what's  the word I'm looking for, like a, a group of people that, uh, is, is set on a certain  ideology.  Yeah, but, Eric, don't you think that they should have to justify why their opinion is 
[03:23:00]  what it is?  They do in certain other things, but they're not polls, those are more like questionnaires  and, and, uh, other things that, that are sent out by politicians or whatever, and then  you do give a reason as to why you don't like somebody.  But most people, believe it or not, are too stupid to actually come up with a reason.  You're right.  No, yeah, that's, that's all I'm saying, that you should have to say, I like this guy  because of this.  You should have to.  Well, there are certain polls that, um, that do that, but they ask certain questions that 
[03:23:30]  are worded that way.  Penn and Teller did something on polls on bullshit.  Thank you, a willful boy.  It's on, it's on YouTube, Travis, if you can find it.  That's always a good show.  Polls are bullshit, because you could, you could, you could do it in radio terms.  If you polled the Opie and Anthony audience and said, how many of you guys like the Opie  and Anthony show?  Yeah.  That would be a pretty big number, right?  It certainly would, but look at what you're drawing from.  Right.  But if you did the same thing with Howard Stern's audience.  Right.  Do you like the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  Those numbers would be a hell of a lot lower, right?  You're asking the same question.  It's even within the same company.  That's what I'm saying.  But you're going to get a completely different, uh, completely different result.  Right.  Completely.  Right.  Yeah, but you're going to, you're going to turn around and say, I like the Opie and Anthony  show because there's broads or whatever.  Really?  You're going to say, when was that?  Why?  I've had one broad in the last six months.  And a lot of homoerotic activity.  Homoerotic.  Yeah, I didn't want to go there. 
[03:24:30]  Okay, good.  I'm punching out, boys.  All right.  Is this the fucking bullshit on the polls thing?  It can be used to fuck with you.  But first, here's a numbers miracle that you can do at home.  Get yourself two sugar bowls and a bunch of cockroaches.  Now, this is one cockroach.  This is two cockroaches.  This is three cockroaches.  We all know what those numbers mean.  Numbers are pure.  They're absolute.  Whether you're talking about baseballs, bugs, or bullshitters, numbers do not lie. 
[03:25:00]  Unlike these cockroaches, numbers don't wiggle.  Odd is odd, and even is even.  Even plus one equals odd.  Always.  Now, here's the trick.  Take your cockroaches in pairs and put them into two bowls.  Take a pair of cockroaches and put them into the bowls.  Take another pair of cockroaches, put them in the bowls.  Even.  Even cockroaches.  Even.  Put them in the bowls.  Keep them even.  Pick them up two at a time and put them in the bowls. 
[03:25:30]  Even, even.  Keep everything even.  Split them evenly.  Two cockroaches just like that.  Picking up giant.  And two more just like that.  No sleight of hand.  Roll the sleeves up.  This is just mathematical.  Two by two by two.  Everyone has to be sure the bowls are even, and you're not adding any or taking away.  Everything has to be totally up front.  No sleight of hand, just a fucking miracle. 
[03:26:00]  Now, let's take one cockroach.  One odd cockroach.  One very odd cockroach.  And if we add that one odd cockroach, not a pair, but one odd cockroach to this even bowl,  that makes the bowl odd.  The other bowl is still even.  Now, you following me?  Now, the magic.  Let's bring a little of the magic sugar and bug shit from the odd bowl in the even bowl,  and let's see what's in the bowl that used to be odd.  A pair. 
[03:26:30]  That's even.  Another pair.  Three bell.  Perfect pair.  He's just doing a magic trick.  All right.  But I see where he's going.  Right.  Like, one thing can change the whole gist of the, yeah, I'm confused.  People are like, I'm confused.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  We went cold into that, thinking they had a nice thing on poles.  It's good when you're sitting there late at night after a few wobbly pops.  Wobbly pops.  Goddamn.  Yeah.  Anthony, we got the VosTech call. 
[03:27:00]  I don't even know what this is.  Oh, God.  Danny, you missed a whole discussion on fucking animal vaginas.  We needed you.  Uh-huh.  We needed your expertise.  I'm sorry.  We couldn't find animal vaginas while you were away.  Who was in my spot?  Trap Dog.  Oh, Trap Dog.  Yeah, Trap Dog was there.  Which animal vaginas did they want?  This is the hardest one, we realized.  Camel vagina.  If you could find camel vagina.  And here's why.  Go to images, because look what comes up.  Camel toes.  Oh, I hear you. 
[03:27:30]  It's very difficult.  Let Danny take this over a little bit.  Yeah.  Let him get there.  In the meantime, Anthony, a big thumbs up coming in.  It's working.  Big thumbs up coming in for this, so take a listen.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through,  you know, the air, satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now, because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter? 
[03:28:00]  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right there.  Yeah, exactly, right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem. 
[03:28:30]  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, what, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet kit?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now... 
[03:29:00]  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that it?  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, a five! 
[03:29:30]  I'm up to my limit of friends.  Five thousand?  I'm not helping you.  I think somebody set up a fan page.  I'm hanging out!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  That's really good.  Holy shit!  That was everything Voss was talking about here live on our show when he was here last night.  Yeah, the listeners got to understand that they didn't work together on that.  Danny just took the audio from Rich on our show and added his part.  That was just Rich.  In the studio.  That's really good, man.  He was trying to describe a problem he was having with his computer at his house. 
[03:30:00]  Amazon Unbox.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he couldn't do it.  And then having him with the phone sound effect calling Radio Shack.  Classic.  God damn, that was very funny.  Very good.  Very fucking funny, man.  Back to Danny.  Camel pussy?  Ah, man, you know.  Wow, you got dromedary, camel, vagina?  Well, I got it because I'm going to have to get a little deeper than just camel.  Yeah, you get deeper than camel vagina.  All right, well, Blue Healer from Kentucky might help you.  Danny, to find camel vagina, just use their genus. 
[03:30:30]  Well, that's kind of where I was going there.  Camelus bactrianus.  Oh.  Camelus bactrianus.  I bet one, I bet two pictures in is a woman's pussy.  Camelus bactrianus.  Vagina.  Oh, I see.  No.  Wow.  No one's taking a picture of a camel cunt and put it up online?  What's wrong with these people?  Come on, people.  Camel porn?  Camel porn.  I'm getting closer.  Oh, it's two camels fucking.  All right.  I'm having a good time, those camels. 
[03:31:00]  Camel toe.  A lot of camel toe.  Yeah, that's going to be the hardest part.  Because they know what people want, and it really isn't camel vagina.  Wait, wait.  There's a camel's toe.  That's a real toe of a camel.  Oh, boy.  Hey.  Dude.  Don't you, can't I just find you like a dog or something?  Ah, we've seen those.  We've seen the dog.  That's old hat by now.  What about a duckbill platypus vagina?  No way.  Nope.  Camel.  I would actually like to see that, though. 
[03:31:30]  I'm going to find it.  Camel.  That's a rough one.  Camel vagina.  You did that already.  I know.  I know.  I know.  That's a tough one.  Oh, he's going down.  Put it in a camel snot box.  They'll show its nose, because they do tend to spit and snot on everything.  Maybe.  Camel.  Camel.  Anus.  You might get a side picture.  If you put camel anus in, you might get a vagina picture just by looking a little further down. 
[03:32:00]  Camel where the poo comes out.  Wait.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  No.  No.  That's from the side.  Fuck.  I thought you had something.  Oh, my God.  That's not real.  That cannot be real.  That's Photoshop.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  That's an ass cave.  Why is there a beaver?  There's like a real beaver sitting there.  Come for camel anus?  This is under camel anus?  Yeah.  Fuck.  This is hard. 
[03:32:30]  How about camel taint?  Camel pregnancy check or pregnancy test because I think they do the same thing with a cow  and shove their hand up.  So maybe you'll see.  Wait.  Charlie's got something.  Charlie.  Virginia.  Camel birth or something.  You might get a.  Ooh.  Charlie.  Camel pregnant.  I'm here.  All right.  What do you got?  Dramadary pussy.  Dramadary pussy.  I think you had dramedary.  I had dramedary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You did dramedary?  Fuck.  Wow.  This is hard.  Uh, Chad's saying try female camel reproductive organ. 
[03:33:00]  Did it work?  Wait.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's a woman.  Camel.  It was?  Yeah, I know.  She's bent in half or something.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's it.  All right.  I think we got.  We might have it, Charlie.  Is a baby camel coming out of it?  Hang on.  It's close, but I want unfettered camel pussy.  Look, man.  Unfettered.  You'll take where he finds you.  That's true.  All right.  Let's zoom into that fucking thing.  All right.  There's some afterbirth coming out.  That's going to be a baby camel coming out of there. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  That's a baby camel coming out.  You can't really see it.  Either that or it's a camel hemorrhoid.  Big roid.  It's a big camel roid.  I think that was only page one.  All right.  Let's keep going.  So Danny's the master.  Camel insemination coming in from Chris from the Poconos.  Oh.  You put anything with camel, you're going to get fucking camel toe pictures, I bet.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  At least a lot of camels.  And there's a camel toe at the bottom of the page. 
[03:34:00]  You can't go one page without a fucking chick showing her camel toe.  Wow, man.  Fuck.  We might have been stumped for the first time on this show.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  Hot fucking pictures, though, on there.  Oh, yeah.  I mean the camels.  Camel, uh...  Camel mating?  That's, uh...  Oh, Footer's got an idea.  Footer really has a good idea.  Footer.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Just, um...  I'm a sweet boy.  How about, um...  Dirty camel cunt?  Oh, yes. 
[03:34:30]  Later, boy.  Watch it work.  That's the same part.  Oh, no.  Of course.  What comes up, it's all camel toes.  All right.  The camel toe is very popular.  Did you go with genitalia?  Female camel genitalia.  Anything with camel.  Dick Richards from New York, thank you.  Camel and pussy is just going to be fucking...  What?  The genitalia show, camel faces.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Second one in. 
[03:35:00]  What?  Is that one next to that guy?  That's a human one.  That's human?  I think it's all four.  Yeah, that's...  Ew, why is it stitched shut?  How do you know?  Because that's ash cheeks right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  I can't tell a woman's vagina from a camel.  It was too close up.  The picture was too close up.  Isn't that terrible?  Yeah, that's not doing a trick, man.  I was playing a game this weekend called Meat or Pussy.  Meat or Pussy. 
[03:35:30]  Or Pussy.  And how did you play?  Close-up picture, and you have to decide if it's meat or pussy.  If it's meat or pussy.  And then you guess.  I forgot which side it was.  It's fun.  And somebody gave me that one on Twitter.  I don't remember your name.  I'm sorry.  It was worth a chuckle for about two minutes.  And he's trying.  He's in a brief history of camels right now on an educational website.  Camel urethra is coming in.  And let's go to Gus in Boston.  Camel vulva.  Gus, in the middle of running the Boston Marathon.  Go ahead, Gus. 
[03:36:00]  Hey, I'm thinking necropsy or autopsy.  Necropsy.  Why?  Yeah.  A dead camel.  Why not?  Yeah.  Oh!  What's that?  I don't think that's a camel, though.  It's like it's been hit with a shotgun.  Holy fuck.  That's a camel from the Bronx.  Oh, god damn.  Don't even fucking hit that.  That's a prolapse.  Damn it.  Are you just frustrated?  Are you admitting defeat?  No.  That's, uh...  No. 
[03:36:30]  Someone's saying that we're stumped every time we try to do math.  Well, that's true, too, Dave.  Dave C.  Math or camel vaginas.  Yeah.  Very, very, uh...  Birth of female camel.  All right, I see that on YouTube.  But it's not a picture.  We need a picture of just a camel's vagina.  Don't fuck around with us.  Did we go with Babymaker?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You tried...  Well, Volvo would be the same thing,  because that's what makes up the camel toe.  Someone's saying camel pee.  Camel pee.  That's gonna work.  No.  No.  Fuck.  Wow.  This is...  This is hard.  My god.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[03:37:30]  Y-E-R.  There you go.  I'll take care of your boredom.  Did we go with perineum?  Perineum.  There you go.  You guys just want to look at some horse pussy, or...?  No, we've done that.  Cows?  Stephen, Ohio.  Try camel perineum.  Perineum.  It's a sexy word.  It sure is.  Camel taint.  No.  No, that's a hair lip.  Oh.  Oh, god.  Look. 
[03:38:00]  I'm...  I'm tapping.  I'm gonna have to tap out.  That's it?  I'm tapping.  I don't know.  Give me some more time.  By tomorrow?  I'll do my best to...  After my nap, I'll continue the search for camel vaginas.  Danny's gonna run out to the Long Island game farm  and just snap a picture of a camel's cunt and fucking bring it in.  Put it on a photo bucket and just end it off.  Put it on a photo bucket.  Look at it.  Look, I got one.  I got one.  Ah, fuck.  Ah, that's hard to find.  Ah.  Ah.  Yep.  What do you say? 
[03:38:30]  What?  What do you say?  What?  Do you want to go home?  I'm saying.  You calling it in?  I got fucking...  Dan's calling it?  I got a workout.  I got fucking sleep.  I got to get back to bed.  Mondays are the toughest workout  because it's, you know, after the weekend  and you're like...  You should work out on the weekends a little bit.  Um...  A little extra.  No.  No?  I like my two days of doing abso-fucking-lutely nothing.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  And then Monday you're back again.  Yeah.  Damn.  I guess we'll call it  without seeing the camel's vagina.  No.  You know.  But a lot of treats, man.  Hey, sarah, sarah.  A lot of nice camel toes.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  That's it, then.  That's it.  We'll be back tomorrow.  Don't fret, people.  Don't cry.  No.  No.  No.  No, don't do that.  Don't do that.  Wah-ha-boom.  I'm a single successful guy. 
[03:39:30]  Wah-ha-boom.  High school's almost over.  Jimmy's back tomorrow.  It's time we start seeing other people.  Jimmy's back tomorrow.  Colin Quinn tomorrow.  Yeah.  Colin.  And more of this tomorrow.  Totally romantic, but cannot be prevented.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Tomorrow.  Oh, geez.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  I hate Danny for finding that.  Very special, um, very special birthday tomorrow, also.  Nope.  Stay tuned.  No.  Going to have a big party here. 
[03:40:00]  No.  In the studio.  No.  What?  Oh.  Oh.  I thought we were going to have a cake.  Tomorrow's an evil, evil day.  Evil day.  You know how well that would fit on a cake?  Let me look.  A round cake with...  My sister's really good at decorating, decorating cakes.  You just kind of get like, you can get like six log cakes and just kind of make it yourself.  Oh, you can do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Six log cakes and, yeah.  Hold it.  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  Hold it.  Do I have camel pussy coming on my Twitter?  No way.  No, that's the one we found.  The black one?  Dummy.  No.  No way.  Camels aren't black, are they?  Camel pussy.  Hold it.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's them.  Hold it.  Uh, uh, uh.  Hold it.  That looks like balls.  Look.  What, you got camel pussy over there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What does that look like?  Oh, my God. 
[03:41:00]  Jesus.  Was that last year we made cupcakes?  Oh, I think that was two years ago.  What are you talking about?  Was that two years ago or was that last year?  I don't remember.  I'm just saying.  Cupcakes might have been made.  Are you serious?  Was that?  That was last year?  Yeah.  No, I'm just, I'm verbally chatting.  Yes.  That was a good cupcake.  That was good cupcakes.  Fucking weirdo.  That was good cupcakes.  That was a good cupcake.  God damn.  They were funny.  All right. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  No one could find this fucking thing, is it?  No, that's a tough one.  All right.  We'll figure it out for tomorrow.  I have camel balls.  Big balls.  Of course they have camel balls all over the internet, though, right?  Of course.  God.  That's some big fucking balls.  Fucking dull fucking standard, man.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Danny's still trying.  Oh, my God.  Animal vaginas.  We kind of went down that road.  The old dirt road.  Oh, is that a horse? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Horse.  Of course.  Of course.  Horses are easy.  Yeah.  You can put your whole fist in there.  Apparently they are.  Literally.  Very easy.  All right, Charles.
