<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts discussing their icy morning commutes, transitioning to a playful mockery of Chesley Sullenberger's seemingly perfect image, highlighted by a newspaper article about his overdue library book.  The conversation then turns to a mouse infestation in the office, stemming from a co-worker's hoarding habits, and a brief mention of the anniversary of the Amadou Diallo shooting.  A significant portion of the show revolves around Sam's father's unusual culinary preferences,  including a buttermilk and cracker mix and a sardine and onion sandwich.  Sam brings the ingredients to the studio, and E-Rock is challenged to eat the sardine sandwich, reacting with disgust and near-vomiting.  This "greatest treats" segment continues with E-Rock enduring raw potatoes and curdled buttermilk, while the hosts provide commentary on the food's origins and E-Rock’s increasingly negative reactions. A caller comments that at least E-Rock's breath smells better.

Studio guest Otto (from Otto and George) joins the show, reacting to the "greatest treats" segment with anecdotes of his own unusual eating habits.  The conversation veers into Facebook, Otto's comedy shows, a California trip including Hearst Castle, and reactions to President Obama's election. Otto shares a disturbing story about a Titanic-themed water slide. The show plays audio clips of a Deep South politician with poor communication skills and "Boo Got Shot," a humorous eyewitness account of a shooting.  A recurring bit about the office mouse problem and a Black History Month tribute to Tony Burton (Rocky's Duke) are also included.

A substantial portion of the broadcast delves into a discussion about racial stereotypes, fueled by Anthony's controversial and offensive comments about Black women and communities.  Caller Jill challenges Anthony's views, sparking a heated debate.  Black caller Tony offers a contrasting perspective.  This segment includes listener calls, further fueling the debate on race relations and police interactions.  The show also plays audio clips: "I need a Bambulance" (a 911 call about a deer), a Dilbert comic strip, and a voicemail of someone arguing with a repo man.  Otto and George remain as studio guests throughout parts of this segment.

The show features a game involving listener-submitted three-panel Dilbert comics, many containing sexually explicit and offensive jokes.  Intern Paul, Intern David, Uncle Paul, and Heather submit entries, with a particularly lengthy discussion surrounding a sexual encounter between Dogbert and Dilbert involving oven mitts.  One entry includes the phrase "now blow me."

The broadcast later revisits Bill Hicks' banned 1993 appearance on David Letterman, playing audio clips of Hicks discussing the incident and Letterman's subsequent apology to Hicks’ mother.  The hosts and callers debate the sincerity of public apologies, referencing Bill Clinton and others.  The segment includes tangents about celebrities' siblings and the hosts’ sound effects collections.  The banned Bill Hicks set is played in its entirety. Otto is present in the studio during portions of this discussion as well.

Finally, the show includes a discussion about a videotape featuring a man named Bill, described as "tremendous" and "perfect," revealing more about the speaker than Bill himself. The speaker notes the video’s timelessness and implies Bill was ahead of his time.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning.  Hi.  It starts with a good morning.  It always does, because we're courteous.  Good morning to you.  On this Wednesday morning.  On this cold Wednesday morning in New York City.  You guys got it pretty easy in New York. 
[00:00:30]  Like, as I was driving in, I noticed, hey, the snow's gone.  Yeah.  It was like nothing.  And meanwhile, my vehicle looks like I just drove it down from Alaska.  Just covered in snow.  And it was like icy, that crusted over snow.  So, uh...  The crunchy snow.  Crunchy snow, yeah.  And then I had to park my car out on the street this morning,  because my driveway was taken up with trucks from the construction guys.  And I realized I had no gas yesterday when I pulled up. 
[00:01:00]  But I'm like, oh, I'll just get it later.  Knowing.  I'm just not going to do that.  So it sat out by the curb, covered in snow.  I wake up, normal time.  Go out to the car.  And, uh, it's just completely frozen over.  So I start it up.  Blast the heat.  Shut the door.  Go back inside for a while.  Not long enough.  I'm the guy driving down the street with icebergs flying off my truck.  Oh, I love that.  The wipers just going...  Getting sandpaper down to nothing. 
[00:01:30]  I love the panel of snow that flies off some of these vehicles.  And just...  It's spinning like that thing that they put the criminals in in Superman 2.  It's just spinning towards your car.  And you hold your breath for a second because you don't know if it's, like, just pure ice or just...  Yeah, it could be solid ice that's going to come through your windshield.  Or just, like, some well-put-together snow.  I love when you hit those, though, and it's just like...  I make believe I'm in a meteor storm.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:02:00]  It's fun.  I make believe I'm a superhero.  Yeah.  And I can withstand anything.  Crash through it.  It's pretty cool when it just crashes right through your car.  I go, we're hit, we're hit!  And then I try to drive my car into the Hudson River.  Yeah, why?  Oh.  And then I try to save myself and all aboard.  You know, there's an update on Sully today.  Really?  What?  Petter?  Petter, was he kicked off of MySpace with 90,000 other people?  His goodness is really starting to bother me.  Yeah, is he just a good guy?  I was in with the whole hero thing. 
[00:02:30]  I thought it was a nice little story, considering what the hell's going on with the world these days.  So it was a nice little break from everything.  I was coming all out of the crap.  I was in.  I was so in with the Sully guy.  There's an article in the paper today.  He's such a do-gooder.  He's worried because he's not going to be able to return a book to the library.  Yes, I read that.  And he actually called up the library yesterday and said, look, I don't know how to tell you this,  but I'm not going to be able to return the book on ethics. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, stop.  He's lying.  It was Rent Boys.  He's glad it's at the bottom of the Hudson.  On ethics.  And yeah, you nailed it.  The book is at the bottom of the Hudson.  Yeah.  So I'm sure there's going to be some scuba divers going, oh my God, that book's worth something.  I've got to get the book.  You think the library would make a big deal and be like, oh, it's okay.  Library said it's okay.  He doesn't have to pay.  Or he'll be in there like giving them a few bucks for the book for a photo op.  Knowing librarians, they're a bunch of sticklers. 
[00:03:30]  They're going to just like ride them for it.  They do.  Late charges.  Yeah.  The book was called How to Cook Geese at 5,000 feet.  He kind of needed that book for that flight.  The turbine engine.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Fun snacks for the turbine.  Yeah, he is quite the do-gooder.  He really is.  There's got to be some horrific skeletons in his closet.  There's got to be a blip. 
[00:04:00]  Somewhere.  Something.  Yeah, there's got to be.  We all have something, don't we?  Why is it that we just don't want to accept that this guy is just a decent human being?  Him and his wife shed tears over the whole event when they had their private moments together,  talking about how he really thought it was going to be a horrific incident when he was coming in.  He didn't have this, you know, brash confidence that he was going to be able to land that thing like he did.  And when it comes to surviving, the pilots, they're pretty much the first ones to go. 
[00:04:30]  Most planes don't have the nose up when they crash, is what it is.  He said it was a surreal moment and, you know, and that it was just silence.  Yeah.  Because he knew there was no engines running.  There was nothing.  It was just silence in the air.  You just hear a little wind whipping over the wings.  Him being a glider pilot, though, is used to that.  Of course.  That's all you hear in a glider, apparently, is just the wind over the wings.  But when you have an air bus like that, you don't want to hear just air over the wings. 
[00:05:00]  Just amazing.  Anyway, we just checked the mousetraps because some people care.  How are we doing?  Sully freed the mice.  Oh, that bastard.  He saved these everywhere.  That do-gooder.  Sully's just going around doing everything good for everything.  He was putting solvent on the mouse feet to help nurse them back to health.  Dude, that's Sully.  What a creepy ass.  Ruining our bitch.  I know.  I understand.  He's been tending to the fish that he's landed on, too. 
[00:05:30]  He has a tank full of injured fish.  We should put some peanut butter on that petto mustache of his and let the mice do some nibbling.  Yeah, rat and geranimals get stuck to his face.  Yeah, we got electric mousetraps set at the other joint.  Because some people out there care.  We have no kills.  Still no kills.  Zero kills.  Very surprised at that.  But then again, there's so much food for these mice that they don't have to be going into 
[00:06:00]  some kind of electric maze to find treats.  I know.  There's treats everywhere.  The treats are everywhere.  Because of that dummy.  Yeah, but we're going to keep checking on the mousetraps as the show goes on today.  Disgusting hoarder over there.  Oh, he moved one of the mousetraps.  He moved Jimmy's mousetrap.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  It was in his area.  He wasn't happy about it.  How about there's pests in your area?  He wasn't happy about it.  There's pestilence in your area and the trap needs to be there because you're a slob and  that's why there's a trap there.  And what about the rat poison? 
[00:06:30]  Did he move that?  I don't know.  Did he move those blue crystals?  Those delicious looking blue crystals?  They look like Pop Rocks kids.  Yeah.  Let's pop a few of those in.  He rocks me out.  Ooh.  So wait, was he mad when he came in yesterday?  I guess.  Maybe we'd get Sam or one of the guys that knows.  He must have been livid because he doesn't like people effing with his stuff.  Yeah, he's...  Meanwhile, his stuff is the reason that there's so many mice in the place.  Just to bring everyone up to date, if you weren't listening yesterday, this guy we work  with over there because he refuses to leave.  He's the last holdout. 
[00:07:00]  Everyone else left and gave us this facility for the Opie and Anthony show.  He's a hoarder.  Yeah.  Just piles and piles of stuff like you see on the news, those people that live among their  own filth and they make tunnels because there's so much stuff in their house.  He's one of those guys with his area.  And he turned his little corner of the office into one of those areas.  It's disgusting.  Papers and old coffee cups, food, pizza boxes.  It's disgusting.  Piles and piles.  And then he chains his chair to a file cabinet because he thinks someone's going to take his  dumb chair.  He wants to take his stink chair. 
[00:07:30]  And then it says mine on the back of his chair.  Probably smells like one of those friggin' little rascals driven by an old guy with incontinence.  What do you got on him, Sam?  Well, Mars tipped me off that he sometimes listens to the show, so I think he didn't flip  out and throw things like he has in the past because he might have known that we wanted  him to.  Yeah.  But instead, he spent the whole time going back and forth rearranging all the things that  we had moved and mumbling things. 
[00:08:00]  Did he clean up and throw stuff away, perhaps?  I think, no.  He just moved them to other spots.  Yeah, that's great.  The mice will be like, hey, they moved it.  Let's go away.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Amadou Diallo was 10 years ago?  No way.  There's no effing way that was 10 years.  What the hell's going on with our lives?  It's tick-tocking away at an alarming rate.  Hold on a minute.  Yep.  The famous shooting here in New York City was 10 years ago today.  They just had a freaking graphic on the TV.  Wow. 
[00:08:30]  Amadou Diallo 10 years ago today?  Yep.  Dude, that is a quick goddamn 10 years.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  Are you kidding me?  Next 10 years goes by, and you're going to be pushing, like, 40.  Well, yeah.  That's terrible.  No, yeah.  Wow.  Late 30s.  I can't keep that dream going anymore.  That dream.  I'm in my late 30s.  We talk about that sometimes.  Then people just think you look horrid for your age. 
[00:09:00]  I know.  You can BS about your age all you want, but you'll reach a point where it's like,  if you say you're still a certain age, people won't look and go, oh, he's young.  They'll look and go, wow, does he look awful for 35?  You nailed it, man.  So you've got to kind of just fess up after a while.  You nailed it.  Because when you live in a building in New York, this is why I need my house.  Because it's like living in a hotel, and you walk through the lobby every day,  and everyone has a comment, whether it's as simple as, how are you doing, Mr. Hughes? 
[00:09:30]  Or it's cold out there, Mr. Hughes.  Mr. Hughes.  Right.  Have a nice day.  They always have to comment.  There's one guy that always says, wow, you look tired.  Wow, you look this.  Wow, you look.  And I finally said, it's not that I look tired.  I'm blank years old.  Shut up.  I'm not a kid.  Right.  I act like one.  I'm immature.  Sure.  But, you know.  I present myself as youthful, but the reality is I'm not a kid anymore,  and that's why I might look a little tired in the morning. 
[00:10:00]  It's like you're on inline skates and riding your bike.  So he thinks you're 12.  Right.  He thinks you're a progeria kid.  I do do all that stuff still.  I don't know.  What the hell's wrong with me?  That makes me happy.  Progeria kid.  Oh, my God.  He's one of those kids that are 12, but they look like they're, you know,  oh, they look a lot older.  But, you know, where I live, it's my house, I guess,  but it's in a building with a lot of other houses,  and you have to deal with people every day.  How many people do you deal with walking into your house? 
[00:10:30]  Just workers.  Yeah, and they'll be gone, right?  Yeah.  I have to deal with other people's.  That live around?  Houses as I try to get to my house.  I've been written off by my neighbors.  I've been written off as the.  Well, that's what you always wanted.  The mafia guy that is a Catholic.  Catholic, I don't fit into the neighborhood.  That's perfect for you.  And then, thank God, Keith told one of the neighbors,  when Keith was there alone, when I was on vacation once,  and Keith was taking care of the house, 
[00:11:00]  Keith decided to tell one of the neighbors that came over  and asked where I was,  because he hadn't seen me a while,  but he didn't see Keith around the house.  And Keith told him that I was arrested on a pedophile.  I had a child porn on my computer, he said,  and other kinds of mob-related stuff, I believe,  and that Keith bought my house for $160,000 at an auction.  That rules.  And the guy was like, he was some Indian gentleman. 
[00:11:30]  So he was like, oh, that is a good price.  Very good price.  So then, I'm just thinking, all right,  that's all fun and well and everything,  but I have to come back to my house at some point.  Yeah.  And now this guy's thinking that I'm around, and I, you know.  Who are you kidding?  You don't care.  And that I did other crimes besides my computer.  But you don't care what they think.  No, I really don't.  You wanted them to leave you alone.  I love them.  I remember when you first bought your house,  they were coming over with little treats and stuff.  Well, I.  And they were trying to get to know you.  I'm kind of human about that,  because I do kind of feel bad that I didn't really reciprocate. 
[00:12:00]  But it was, you know,  I was going through a bit of a tumultuous time in my life  as far as buying a house and trying to fill it up  and things like that.  So I really didn't have time to socialize.  So, you know, that kind of fell by the wayside.  You'll never have time to socialize.  That's just not.  I socialize with my friends.  I bring them over and, you know.  Yeah, I know.  But not your neighbors and stuff.  That's not in your DNA, which is fine.  You know.  I live on a floor.  And there's.  I hope so.  You fall right through to the basement.  There's a door right there. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know who lives there.  No.  And that's even closer than what you got going on.  Is it harder?  I've seen the dude twice.  Huh?  I think it's harder in an apartment.  Or is it?  Because then you're with them in the elevators and stuff.  I don't know.  I've lived in an apartment building in Brooklyn.  And I don't think I said word one to anyone I saw in my elevator or neighbors or anything.  And I heard the neighbors next door yelling and screaming at each other.  Yeah.  Me and Melinda used to run to the wall.  That's the best.  And put a glass next door. 
[00:13:00]  Of course.  Like it's the 1950s.  Of course.  And listen to these two just, I mean, screaming at each other like they're going to kill each other.  Yeah.  And then you'd see them walking around and you'd just be like, oh, God, here's the guy that smacks her around.  Oh, that's Brooklyn.  Here's that.  That's normal behavior in Brooklyn.  Come on.  But, all right.  So I didn't socialize with any neighbors then.  But I don't socialize with neighbors in a house either.  Right.  Well, I guess most people don't unless.  Some people are very neighborly and they have like neighbor block party things and stuff.  I can't.  I have my friends. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Everyone else.  I, I, I'm full up.  I'm full up with friends.  You're done with friends.  Now the only friends I get are, you know, social networking website friends.  Facebook friends.  Facebook.  But you can turn them off at any.  Click.  They're gone.  They're gone.  Which is, imagine if you had that in real life.  Yeah.  That would have been a fine movie if Adam Sandler did it right with that effing remote.  God, that should have been a good movie.  That's a bit for another day.  Movies that should have been good and they were just ruined.  The concept was great. 
[00:14:00]  Stinkaroo.  What was that called?  Click.  Click.  Some of the, some of that movie was, you know, good.  And then he had to go with some kind of weird, spacey, deep message.  Yeah.  There was definitely a message at the end of that.  Stop.  Shouldn't have watched this movie was the message I got.  Yeah.  Just stop.  Waste of time.  Keep it fun.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Oh.  Oh.  Lots to do.  But let me just play a five second clip for everybody. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  Just five seconds of your time, if you don't mind.  You guys don't understand.  Buttermilk is one of the great treats of all time.  I did not forget.  One of the great treats of all time.  That, by the way, was Sam's dad.  Yes.  Where is Sam?  Who is such a personality unto himself.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's the great treats of all time.  Well, one of.  One of.  And then we got a list of some of the other greatest treats of all time. 
[00:15:00]  And we have brought the greatest treats of all time, according to Sam's dad, into the studio today.  Yes.  We have the whole meal.  I went over to my parents' house last night or yesterday afternoon, and he explained not only what all the ingredients were, but how to prepare it.  And he was like, you guys don't understand.  He's showing me.  He actually made his treat for himself.  He was like, you got to crunch the crackers into the buttermilk because he likes the saltines crunched in buttermilk.  And he's like, you don't understand.  We used to have this as a treat when we got home from school. 
[00:15:30]  And I was like, I know.  What, with Laura Ingalls?  And he was showing how quick you have to eat the crackers out of the buttermilk before they get too soggy.  And then once you're done eating.  Wait, he spoons out the.  Yeah.  Oh.  I didn't understand that.  And so there's still a little crunch to him?  Right.  Like you pour, you put the cracker crumbs in the buttermilk.  And they got to go, ah, grab a spoon and start eating.  Great.  You eat them out with a spoon.  And then once you're done eating the crackers, you get to.  You take the bowl up to the old guy and go, please, sir, may I have some more? 
[00:16:00]  Because that sounds like disgusting porridge.  No.  Then you get to drink the delicious buttermilk.  One of the great treats of all time.  And that's salty.  Yeah.  Thick, salty, and.  You know, I don't know if you heard, but as Sam was describing some of this stuff, I hear E-Rock over there just moaning.  Very, very lightly in the background.  You know why?  Barely audible.  But I heard it, my friend.  Because he knows.  Because E-Rock has to try the greatest treats of all time, according to Sam's dad.  When do you want to do this?  Right after the break, get it over with? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, whenever you want.  Man, it's too early for, what is it, sardines?  Well, that's the main course would be the sardine and onion sandwich.  Yeah.  Which, I mean, he showed me, he gave me an onion and said, you cut from the middle of the onion.  The thick slice.  And make sure, and they're about a quarter inch thick slices.  A quarter inch thick?  Yes.  Yes, two quarter inch thick slices and then a whole can of sardines.  A whole can of sardines on what?  Just white bread?  No, it's like, it's rye bread or some kind of bread. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  Whole grain maybe.  I don't know.  If it was white bread, it would just be a soggy mess like crackers.  E-Rock, you know you have to eat the whole sandwich, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't eat breakfast today.  Yeah, you can't just taste the greatest treats of all time.  What are you going to do, throw away the greatest treat of all time after one bite?  It's the greatest treat.  Don't worry.  I'll have a raw potato for Eric to eat on the side.  Yeah, you eat a raw potato.  That's easy.  And pickles?  And I got a pickle.  That's easy, too.  Sam, did your dad enjoy his time on the show yesterday? 
[00:17:30]  He loved it.  Of course he did.  I think he's going to be a regular.  It's so obvious.  Sam's dad has a handlebar mustache, which no one has in this day and age.  And he eats like it's the depression.  What a weirdo.  What is it like for dessert?  Socks?  I don't like this guy.  Oh, wait.  I wanted to play that again.  It didn't fire for us.  Oh, why would our CD players work?  Why?  Doesn't that explain a little of Sam's weird eating, though?  If his father ate so weird, that's why you eat. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sam has major problems with his eating.  Fish sticks.  You guys don't understand.  Buttermilk is one of the great treats of all time.  Of all time.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  At the end, it's like, hey, come on.  It's not even an average treat yesterday.  No.  Of all time.  Like, we all should know this.  I've never heard of this before in my life.  We got some potato peeling to do.  All right.  Why don't we get a...  There'd be second thoughts about eating that at Auschwitz. 
[00:18:30]  It's like, eh, we'll go another day.  I'll just eat a pile of hair.  All right, after the break, we're going to line up some of the greatest treats of all  time.  Ah, yeah.  And E-Rock's going to indulge.  What kind of bread did you bring in?  It's like, I think it's either rye or whole grain.  I don't know.  It's brown.  Even the bread sucks.  You know what I hate?  Rye bread, eight, seven grain, nine grains.  How many grains are in those stupid breads?  And it's not bread at that point.  It's this, like, someone put gravel in your bread. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I hate that.  Rye bread is not as good.  You need to try this part of my diet.  It's called Ezekiel bread.  Oh, my girl eats that.  Like Ezekiel's meal?  That's a girl's bread.  That's physical bread.  Ah, girl's bread.  Ah, girl's bread.  What's Ezekiel's meal?  It's awful, Jimmy.  You put it in your underwear to prevent spotting.  Ah, girl's bread.  Ezekiel's bread.  I've tried it.  It is awful.  It sounds terrible. 
[00:19:30]  Well, we've got a break, but I want to hear about that after.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, all right, fine.  We'll get into that in some whatever.  O.P. and Anthony, stay there.  This one brings me back.  I was trying to do something there, Stump Brain.  This CD player is minutes away from getting the Christian Bale treatment.  Oh, no.  Minutes away.  And you know how that tray, like, pops out nice? 
[00:20:00]  I will snap it.  The cup holder?  Oh, yeah.  I will snap that right off the machine.  That machine is affecting our radio show.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Da-da-da-da-da.  The machine.  It's the machine.  Da-da-da.  People think we're joking, but we'll be doing this radio show until the equipment officially  breaks down to the point you can't hear us anymore. 
[00:20:30]  It's happening slowly but surely.  All right, 877-212-ON-A.  The greatest treats of all time.  Should we get into this?  Yeah, I think we ought to do a little recap, I guess.  For listeners that might not have been listening during the tail end of the program yesterday,  Sam's dad.  You know Sam?  He's one of our guys here.  Well, his father is a very interesting character, to say the least.  Some people are calling him a weirdo. 
[00:21:00]  Well, Sam's dad is a weirdo.  Weirdo is another word you could use.  It's 2009, and he wears a handlebar mustache, one that kind of curls at the ends.  Oh, yeah.  It could go on anybody that sings in one of those barbershop quartets and look completely  natural on that.  It's a big one.  Oh, it's a biggin'.  And we thought it ended right there, where he just looked weird. 
[00:21:30]  But he is weird.  He's been wearing the handlebar mustache for 40 years.  Yes.  We all change our looks, right?  Yeah.  We all change our look from time to time.  No.  He found this handlebar mustache, and man, he's sticking with it.  Well, yesterday during our interview with him on the phone, during his phoner.  Well, he demanded an official interview instead of just being a caller to our radio show.  Well, he was being mocked relentlessly by us, so he decided to call in and defend himself.  Yeah.  So he, in the mid-60s, grew this handlebar mustache to get his self-esteem up, I guess. 
[00:22:00]  And he says chicks were just flocking toward him, including none other than Sam's mom.  So that handlebar mustache is responsible for us having Sam on our show.  That's what he said.  And you even being on the planet.  I guess so.  She couldn't resist that handlebar mustache.  How bad was his self-esteem when that was the picker-upper?  I know.  What was on his face before that? 
[00:22:30]  What's that covering up Stacey Keech's lip?  That's hilarious.  I had a photo of the Manson murders taped under my nose, and the girls didn't like me.  Sam, do you like the handlebar mustache?  Well, I don't think I'd be able to cope if it were Don.  You're so used to it.  It's your whole life.  Yes.  You know your dad with the handlebar mustache on.  It's not an odd thing, didn't he?  So if he shaved it, you would be like, ah, it's not even dad anymore.  You notice that your dad gets a few more looks out there when he's walking around? 
[00:23:00]  I guess so.  Have you noticed?  Because we all love looking at freaks.  I've got to ask you something, and you've got to be honest.  All right.  But have you ever noticed people chuckling as they walk by and just known they were laughing  at your dad's handlebar mustache?  Well, as I've gotten older, I have noticed the looks he gets from the supermarket attendant  or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what I'm thinking of.  Have you heard like, ugh, you dick, or anything like that? 
[00:23:30]  Nothing that blatant.  Not that blatant?  But I think he likes the attention it brings him, and in his mind, and I think it's true,  people look at him like he's somewhat a person of importance.  Of importance.  Because why else would he have that facial hairstyle?  It's a person of importance back in like 1905.  Yes.  That's when he would have been maybe a Wall Street executive or something where, you know,  you had the handlebar mustache, and you're like, why sell? 
[00:24:00]  We've just made another $12.  He's old school important.  Yeah, yeah.  And his treats, as he calls them, are also old school.  Because as we were talking about the handlebar mustache, we were kind of goofing on old things  and the bicycle with the big front wheel and the little rear wheel, and a monocle, I think,  was brought up.  Yes, that was brought up.  A monocle.  Does he wear a monocle?  He doesn't.  And then his food habits and his eating got brought up,  and that, too, is very odd and very old school in a way that nobody in this day and age would, 
[00:24:30]  like when he brought up buttermilk, that he drinks buttermilk.  That was odd enough.  And then wait until you hear what he does with it, but it's just,  that was like something you would do, like,  ah, let's grab a glass of buttermilk, you and me.  Yes, buttermilk.  Then we'll catch the show on the Great White Way.  Literally, White Way.  Yes.  Wonderful.  Not a Negro in sight.  Obama President, nah. 
[00:25:00]  Well, I know.  I was just talking about the old days.  Well, times have changed.  Kind of like that.  Very racist society back then.  I think handlebar mustache says racist.  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  What else does it say, Sam?  Let's be honest with each other.  Jeez.  Your dad's not up, right?  We're not going to get scolded again today like we did yesterday?  I don't know.  I wouldn't put it past him to have gotten up at 6 o'clock and just turned the radio on.  No, right now, he's got that Fred Mertz stocking cap on, and he's snoring like, and the little 
[00:25:30]  candle on the side of his bed, the flame's going in and out as he snores.  We got a guy who wants to defend the handlebar mustache.  Good luck to you, Gene.  Hi, Gene.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  You sound like you have a handlebar mustache.  Well, I could have one, but I'm getting to the point where my mustache is long enough I can do that.  Right.  I'm 41. 
[00:26:00]  My dad is like 71, and he's had it forever since I remember him as a kid.  My father's always had it.  It's a little thin.  It's not as big as that other guy's father.  Sam's, yeah.  Sam's.  Yeah.  He uses saddle soap on the ends.  Saddle soap?  Yeah.  It's in a round can.  He rubs it off and curls it up.  It's thin on his end, and they're very well-defined curls.  He doesn't get any comments, although what he does get is the Indian fellows, fellows from 
[00:26:30]  India, that he knows, like parking a lot of times where he used to work.  It's like, oh, yeah, yeah, it's very good.  We like the handlebar mustache.  Well, because they have, yeah, they wear, they wear, but it's not my handlebar.  They probably wear more than anyone else, right?  Yeah.  Right.  But the thing is, like, they have the beard, too.  The Seeks.  Yeah.  It's the Seeks.  With the turbans, too.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Every time you see one of these handlebar mustaches.  My father's had it for years, and I said I even, probably longer than Sam's dad. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And he's very hard to get rid of.  Other than, until I heard this today, I never heard of anyone else having one, though.  I thought my father was the only one.  Now, there's people you still see walking around.  You shave it.  That's how you get rid of it.  Yeah.  It's an easy, snip the ends.  It's an easy solution, my friend.  Snip, snip.  He shaved if it wasn't dad, because my father accidentally shaved his mustache once when  I was a kid, and we were freaked out as kids.  We didn't, he wasn't dad anymore.  Wow. 
[00:27:30]  All right, James.  It's great.  A curly flavor saver.  Yeah.  Saddle soap is like, how does, now, now, is your mom still around?  Yes.  And how long has he had this mustache?  Your whole life, right?  Oh, yes, pretty much.  Now, did it ever, did the saddle soap ever annoy her when maybe, you know, they were kissing,  you know, and I'm not talking, you know, you don't have to be all intimate and everything,  but just, you know, maybe a goodbye kiss, and she's then smelling saddle soap.  I don't think he puts that much on.  It's pretty thin on the ends. 
[00:28:00]  Dude, I've used saddle soap.  She always kind of liked it, I think.  It's pretty pungent.  Really?  Why haven't you used it?  On a saddle.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, sorry.  You know, where it's supposed to go.  Stupid me.  Yeah, actually, for a while, I was shining my saddle with mustache wax.  Wait, the saddle soap would curl the mustache up and keep it curled?  Yeah, I guess it acts like wax or soap.  That's what he used it for.  Although there is mustache wax, too.  I used to buy them that for Christmas.  Oh, my God.  Enough about the mustache.  Great stocking stuffer, that is.  Wait, you'd buy a mustache wax for Christmas? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, that's like, because that's the only thing he'd want.  One of those terrible households, one of those tins of mustache wax could last, like, more  than one lifetime.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why would you have to buy one every year?  Unless you're clumping it on.  The little tube would come, and it would come with a little brush and comb for the mustache,  too, like, and a little blister.  What the fuck?  A mustache care kit.  It would come with a mirror and a razor.  Get over it.  Cut the malarkey.  Realize you're not special.  You're just like everybody else.  Right.  Get rid of your dumb mustache to try to stand out. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, sorry, Sam.  You're still here.  Yeah.  Hi.  Oh, boy.  Hi.  All right.  Gene, thank you.  You're just an odd man with a weird palate and an effeminate son.  All right.  So we've got the greatest treats of all time in front of us here, right?  Yeah, we have.  As per Sam's dad.  Yes.  Ah, there's the buttermilk.  Wow, look at that.  Let me hold that a minute, because I want to...  It's one half percent milk fat.  What does that mean?  I have no idea.  It doesn't sound like... 
[00:29:30]  That doesn't sound like a lot.  I've never seen buttermilk before.  No one has.  This is...  All right, all right.  Especially me.  There's a problem here already.  Uh-oh.  This is cultured, low-fat buttermilk.  We don't want low-fat.  We want buttermilk.  Does he drink the low-fat buttermilk?  That's a carton from the fridge that he drinks.  Oh!  All right.  I thought maybe you ran out and got this.  I went, what's the difference between buttermilk and milk?  The mercantile.  You bought...  You stole your father's buttermilk? 
[00:30:00]  He donated it to the show.  Yeah, he was all excited to be part of the show today.  That's right.  You know, he's been retired a while.  He's kind of bored.  He needs a hobby, so he's deciding where his hobby.  Great.  Thanks, Sam.  We're stuck with your dad for a while.  You're just going to be calling even after you get rid of me.  Like the unmistakable taste and limitless possibilities of our buttermilk?  Yeah.  Whether it's in a stack of pancakes or a recipe for your favorite biscuits.  Biscuits?  Garlic Farms buttermilk always adds more. 
[00:30:30]  The key to life is what you add to it.  And adding something is what we do best.  So I guess whether you're crunching up crackers or, you know, pancakes, it's amazing.  It has a specific scent.  It smells like spoiled milk.  It does?  Yes.  Oh, perfect.  And it says...  Their slogan up top is add something.  Exactly.  Does that mean just add something to it?  We got some saltine crackers.  All righty. 
[00:31:00]  That seems...  Wow, that's a handle on my mustache.  And you know how to break them up?  Oh, yeah.  Just right?  Yep.  Because we learned if you're going to have the greatest treats of all time, or some of  the greatest treats of all time, you've got to break up the crackers on top of the buttermilk  in such a way, right?  Right.  And it's a regular onion?  It's not even like a red onion?  No, yeah.  We've got a regular onion.  Here's the bread.  Brown and grainy.  Yeah.  It's just hard.  Greatest treat...  What was it?  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  One of the greatest treats of all time. 
[00:31:30]  Of all time!  Is buttermilk.  Yeah.  He said, of all time!  But all of this is some of the greatest treats of all time.  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  Oh.  So you've got the bread, you've got the crackers, you've got the onion, some skinless and boneless  sardines.  Ugh.  And pure olive oil.  All right.  Da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  We've got a potato.  Yeah, because this family, this family of Sam's, they all like raw potatoes.  We all eat raw potatoes.  They're good.  Like an apple.  How poor are you?  I know!  This is like...  The potatoes are good.  No one makes that weird when you bite into a raw potato, because I have. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  It bites like an apple, but you don't get the goodness of an apple.  No, you're getting this weird, starchy taste, and then, like, the enamel on your teeth starts  to, like, turn into cement.  It gets all slimy.  It's great.  Yeah.  It gets weird.  Yeah.  Like, it reacts chemically with the enamel.  And you've got a pickle.  A dill pickle on the side.  I just did half a pickle, because E-Rock doesn't need a whole pickle.  No, that would actually be the treat at that point. 
[00:32:30]  You want to give them as little of that as possible.  What happened to, like, Oreo cookies and a nice glass of milk for some of the greatest  treats of all time?  A nice glass of buttermilk.  And crackers.  When you think treats, you think sweet.  You think cookies.  You think pie.  You think ice cream.  My dad said butter...  You think cakey, not flaky, right, Adam?  That's poverty food.  The buttermilk tastes like a delicious yogurt drink, he said.  Whoa.  Is he that fat?  No, he's not fat.  He's got, you know, a middle-aged man belly on it. 
[00:33:00]  No, he's got a buttermilk belly.  Maybe a buttermilk belly, but he's not fat at all.  He's got the dad body.  Yeah.  Buttermilk is milk that's left after the milk is made.  Yes, that's true.  Holy mother of God, they take the milk out and that's what's left?  Yeah, that's all the stuff no one ever wanted.  After you churn.  Then what is it?  It's the butter, but...  And then you have...  It's in between butter and milk.  It's the residual left after you churn butter.  It's slightly sour and usually less fat than normal sweet milk.  Right.  Normal sweet milk.  Oh, holy mother of God. 
[00:33:30]  All right, Sam.  God.  Are you going to start preparing some of the greatest treats of all time?  Yeah, let's do it.  Are we actually doing this today?  Yeah.  Well, I want to know if other people find it delicious.  This dumb thing has taken on a life of its own.  And, of course, E-Rock will be eating some of the greatest treats of all time.  He's got to eat the whole sandwich.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  You know, you've never turned down the food before, right, E?  Once.  Once?  What was that?  You were offering me Oreos.  S'mores and Oreos.  I think 12-year-old JC has a problem with the buttermilk thing. 
[00:34:00]  All right, let's go to JC.  JC.  Hey.  Hold on, JC.  We didn't...  Yo, yo, yo.  We didn't have you, JC.  Start over.  What's up?  All right, wait.  Am I on or what?  Yeah, let's go.  All right.  Remember to save the buttermilk and send it to the boys in the trenches.  Oh, my God.  You just bombed.  I love it.  Yeah, that's great.  I love it.  Oh, I did?  Oh, shit.  Okay. 
[00:34:30]  Good recovery.  You little bastard, you.  It's hysterical.  We said he bombed and he went, ah, ass.  I did.  I liked the line in print.  Yeah.  That's good.  Like, you've got to save it for the boys in the trenches.  Well, his voice has got to mature before he starts doing voices.  That old newsreel voice.  Yeah.  The concept was definitely there.  He could have done a 4-H bit.  Yeah.  Where, you know, his favorite cow that he won a blue ribbon with is making buttermilk.  Amazing.  Work on it.  Hey, yeah, we got a quickie as Sam. 
[00:35:00]  Cotton onions.  Yeah.  Ah.  Sam is preparing some of the greatest treats of all time for E-Rock.  I missed the Letterman thing.  What do you got on Letterman?  You said that it was funny.  I can't say his name still.  The governor from Illinois.  Blagojevich.  Blagojevich.  Blagojevich is still.  I mean, he's out.  He's banned for life.  But he is, thinks he's a rock star.  I like this guy.  He's doing all that you like him.  I love him, actually. 
[00:35:30]  Self-promoting ass.  How do you not love, he's got, A, the best head of hair ever.  And he just won't stop.  Yeah.  He will go on every talk show.  He's probably been advised by every legal advisor and everything to keep your mouth shut, just stay in your house, don't go out.  And this guy just threw caution to the wind and does every single show out there.  He's going down like De Niro at the end of Cape Fear.  He just won't stop.  He won't stop.  So he did Letterman. 
[00:36:00]  Letterman had a great line.  Letterman didn't cut him any slack, that's for sure.  He's looking for his book deal.  Yeah.  He needs something to do now that he's not a politician anymore.  I think, I don't think it's that calculated.  I think this guy, just from, you know, my own personal opinion of looking at people that are losing their minds, this guy's kind of losing it.  Or does he like the attention?  Well, that's just it.  If you like the attention this much, the way he's doing it, there's something a little off about this guy. 
[00:36:30]  Why exactly are you here?  Honest to God.  Well, you know, I've been wanting to be on your show in the worst way for the longest time.  Well, you're on in the worst way, believe me.  Great line.  Nice.  You're on in the worst way.  Yeah, because he's famous for, like, trying to commit a crime.  Boy, a politician committing a crime, that's crazy. 
[00:37:00]  He's thrown out of office.  That's nuts.  Told never to return.  Yeah.  Hey, I've got to give props to Letterman.  Man, I was just telling you guys off air, on Friday he did something really cool that went kind of unnoticed, unless you're watching Letterman.  Like, I think the media should have picked up on it a little bit, or the comedy circles.  But I'm a huge fan, still am, of Bill Hicks.  Yeah.  And Bill Hicks did Letterman's show many, many times.  And back in 1993, I believe, he did a set for Letterman.  And for some reason, Letterman said, nope, we're not airing that tonight. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, he did do it on the show, and they didn't air?  Oh, yeah, and they shelled this Bill Hicks appearance for 16 years.  16 years.  And the Bill Hicks people were trying to get this, so they could maybe put it out on DVD for the fans and stuff,  because it became this thing.  And Letterman had Bill Hicks' mom on, on Friday, and they discussed this whole thing,  and how this set was never aired, blah, blah, blah, and how did it make you feel.  And Letterman had a real moment with Bill Hicks' mom. 
[00:38:00]  It was some really good TV.  And to make a long story short, then.  They didn't air that.  Huh?  Oh, they aired, yeah.  Do we have that?  They shelved his interview with the mother about shelving.  She was kind of boring, but, you know, she's a mom, you know.  And then on Friday, they aired this Bill Hicks appearance from 1993 that just sat on the shelf for 16 years.  And Letterman even admitted on Friday he never saw the set since the day they decided not to air it. 
[00:38:30]  Really?  It was a pretty good TV moment.  And it turns out, too, we learned after the fact that when Bill Hicks did this in 1993,  he was already sick with pancreatic cancer and on his way out.  And you could kind of tell because he's a bit thinner and he doesn't look as healthy as he used to.  Why did Letterman decide it wasn't good enough after he had been on something?  It wasn't about not good enough.  It's something we fight all the time.  Yeah, Jimmy, content.  A little religious stuff in there. 
[00:39:00]  And I do believe some of the bits were a bit on the violent side, but hilarious.  Hilarious.  He takes some fine shots at Billy Ray Cyrus, who was popular at the time.  Now his daughter is, obviously.  Do we have any?  I would love to let him talk to the mother at least.  Do we have any of that at all?  Yeah, we could cut that up.  Okay.  But it was a great, it was a great moment.  I DVR'd it and checked that out last night, man.  So props to Letterman.  And he apologized to his mom and says, I hope this helps you in some way. 
[00:39:30]  You know, and she admitted, yeah, that really hurt Bill and it hurt our family.  It was a tough one for us to, you know, deal with.  Wow.  Yeah, it was good.  I liked it.  Uh-oh.  You're opening up the sardines there, Sam.  We're opening the can of sardines for E-Rock.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Those are never easy to open.  You're always in imminent danger of splitting your wrists or fingers off or something.  Well, the place the thumb meets the hand, I'm always a fan of that cut there.  Why can't they come up with a better sardine can? 
[00:40:00]  I'm a victim of the lid cut.  I almost lost my thumb as a kid.  I got a lid cut scar right there.  This scar is still pretty impressive, and I got it when I was like 12 years old.  Mine wasn't opening the can, but it was taking it in the.  Remember when you had to make orange juice?  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think anyone makes their orange juice anymore.  And that was one, like as a kid, they're like, yeah, you want to make the orange juice today?  And I'm like 11 or 12, and I pushed the lid down after I with the can opener, 
[00:40:30]  and I pretty much sliced my thumb almost right off, or a nice chunk of it,  and they were able to stitch it back together.  I still got a nice looking scar.  Mine was the top of a Campbell's soup can, and I took it off, ate the soup.  It was wonderful.  Threw away the can and the lid, and then went to take the garbage out,  and the garbage was stacked up pretty high, so I pushed down on the top of the bag,  and the lid cut right through the bag, right through the palm of my hand. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  It's like, why do they make things?  This is dangerous.  It's like playing with razor blades as a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  You're playing with razor blades.  Let me throw some razor blades in the garbage, and then press down on the top of it willy-nilly.  I'll throw some broken glass in there.  Sure.  All right, E-Rock, get ready.  You're going to be trying some of the greatest treats of all.  Ugh.  I'm not a fan of the sarge.  Ew.  Nope.  They're actually tasty.  Let me smell that.  Sardine sandwich?  They smell fishy, I would think. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  They're packed in.  I actually like sardines because they're an excellent comparison.  Whenever I'm in a tight situation, I bring them up.  Yeah, well.  Of course.  You know, this is.  Like I have bad jokes packed in like a can of sardines.  Ta-da.  Sardines are one of those foods, they say,  is like one of the best things you could have.  What?  Is it healthy?  Extremely.  How much sodium is in sardines?  Extremely healthy sardines. 
[00:42:00]  It's one of the world's great treats.  No, it's.  No.  No, it's not.  It isn't.  And we'll prove that when E-Rock attempts to like eat a sardine onion sandwich.  Canned fish.  With buttermilk.  And buttermilk.  How did your father ever eat?  What's wrong with him?  All right, we got to take a break.  E-Rock, get ready.  Yeah.  You're up next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:42:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  877-212-ON-A.  Let's have E-Rock try the greatest treats, or some of the greatest treats of all time.  Wait a minute, look at it, it's all stacked up.  What is that?  This is a whole can of sardines.  A whole can of sardines, okay.  Yeah, and then two slices of onion that are about a quarter inch thick. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  They kind of fell apart a little bit, so I spread it out across.  Oh, the pickle's on the sandwich, too?  No, the pickle is right here with the raw potato.  That's a little snack on the side.  A whole snack.  And then I waited, I didn't put the buttermilk concoction together yet.  Oh, no.  Because you've got to eat, you know, the crackers out of the buttermilk right away.  And that's like dessert.  That's dessert.  And your dad would be proud of how you prepared some of the greatest treats of all time?  This is something, he would look at this sandwich and say, oh my goodness. 
[00:43:30]  What did I do to deserve such a treat?  You're an ass.  Here, present some of the greatest treats of all time with the pickle and the raw potato.  Okay.  Get a little picture here before we move it over to E-Rock.  It's prison food.  Look at it.  It looks like it belongs on a prison track.  Yeah, absolutely.  You gonna eat that?  All right.  E-Rock, you ready to try some of the greatest treats of all time?  We have some salt for the potato if you prefer with salt.  Some people do. 
[00:44:00]  Some people do.  I prefer pepper, actually.  What about your dad?  He likes salt.  He likes salt on that potato.  He pours salt on everything, though.  He doesn't even taste.  He just pours salt on that.  What else does this health nut do?  Salt on everything and buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  Did he prepare the buttermilk with the crackers?  Well, I wanted to wait until just before he eats the crackers so that way they don't lose their crunch.  He's gonna be able to squeeze mustache wax out of his aorta.  I definitely think he should start with the sandwich because, as we discussed, the cracker-buttermilk concoction is a treat. 
[00:44:30]  It's like dessert.  But it's timely.  You gotta watch the timing on that one.  How does he wash down the sardine sandwich?  How about if you had the buttermilk and occasionally you sprinkle a cracker in when Fatso has to wash down a little bit of...  I'm just for the bit.  He just threw his arms up in the air.  When he wants to wash down some, you give him a little bit of buttermilk and you sprinkle some cracker and he spoons it into his mouth.  And that way you're eating a little treat along with the sandwich. 
[00:45:00]  I want to keep the authenticity of Sam's dad and his consumption habits.  Does your dad ever just drink buttermilk in a glass?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, then that's fine.  Then give him a little glass of buttermilk to wash it down.  Worsh.  Would anybody like to smell the buttermilk?  I like to smell it, yeah.  That's a lot of worsh.  I don't even have to get it too close.  Oh, my God.  It is very strong.  It's like sour-y.  I can't smell the whole problem.  It kind of smells like the milk went bad. 
[00:45:30]  No, there's a little more going on in there.  Oh, God.  It smells like breast milk, Anthony.  No, shut up.  Yes, thank you.  Oh, God.  That's the reaction I had, too.  There's a sour butter smell.  It's a salty treat.  It actually probably is good with crackers, I've got to say.  No effing way.  It's probably good with crackers.  No, it's not.  Then eat it.  Eric, make sure that you take a big smell of it right before you take a gulp.  All right.  Bring it over.  All right.  Here's the...  Let's see what it looks like when you pour it.  I want to see what it looks like. 
[00:46:00]  Mmm.  Well, it is thick.  It certainly is thick, Anthony.  Oh, you can't even hear it.  You know, like liquid when you can't hear it.  No, it just kind of goes into itself.  It's pouring motor oil.  It's one entity.  You're pouring, like, mercury or something right into it.  You put that in a crank.  40-weight milk.  Very biscuity.  All right.  Where do you want them to eat this?  Right here.  Do you want me to do it on camera or do you want me to do it over there?  Come over here.  Over there.  I want you close.  Get over there now.  I'll just put the top piece of bread on the sandwich. 
[00:46:30]  Uh-huh.  Look at that.  Tomorrow, we'll have sandwiches.  There you go.  Let's see.  What's wrong?  The onion smell.  Well...  Do you like onions, Yrock?  Yeah, I do.  It's just strong.  Of course.  Do you like sardines?  I've never had sardines.  They're actually good.  Oh, wait.  Maybe in, like, Caesar salad or something, but that's about it.  Sardines and Caesar salad?  Oh, it's anchovies?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Sardines?  Eric, you'll like this.  All right.  Which am I eating first?  Well, this... 
[00:47:00]  Have the sandwich.  This is just your side dish.  Okay.  Your side dish?  You should try a sip of buttermilk first before you taint your mouth.  Yeah.  Why don't you wash out your palate with some buttermilk?  Yeah.  Cleanse out your palate with some buttermilk.  Yeah.  Just have a sip of buttermilk.  Smell the buttermilk first.  It's not bad.  Like a fine wine.  Smells like butter.  Give it a smell.  It's clumpy.  Why are you shaking?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It smells like ranch dressing.  What?  Really?  Well, you've drank that before.  He brings it in a thermos. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  A little swig of buttermilk.  Have a sip.  Just...  Yeah.  Hey, Sam's dad drinks it.  Here we go.  It's probably good, Iraq.  Yeah, it is good.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  Oof.  Here he goes.  What's wrong?  Enjoy.  It's a great treat.  Yeah.  Enjoy the buttermilk.  What happened? 
[00:48:00]  All right.  So the great treat so far is a bust.  What happened, Iraq?  Is he enjoying it?  He's gagging this buttermilk all over the garbage.  It's just dumb buttermilk.  What happened that it made you gag like that?  Well, the salt separated from what tastes like really sour milk, so you're getting the  best of both. 
[00:48:30]  Is it really that bad?  It's not bad when you first drink it.  Dude.  But as you start to...  It starts to separate.  People like butter.  People like milk.  That is the byproduct that's left over.  Yeah.  Why would you drink it?  Why would you...  Exactly.  Buttermilk stinks.  Want some crackers?  Well, you've got to put it in the buttermilk, but that's dessert.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Don't spoil the boy's first meal.  His actual first course, the sardines, onions, on some wonderful green bread stuff. 
[00:49:00]  No, no.  Take a bite out of the middle.  Oh, shut up.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Why don't we cut the sandwich in half so you get a nice bite of goodness?  Well, he's eating the whole thing.  You have to.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, you've got to eat the whole thing.  There you go.  Come on, kid.  He's lifting up the sardine and onion sandwich.  Perfect for seven o'clock in the morning.  Hey, he's dropping the onions out of the sandwich.  Yeah.  Don't lose any onions.  What's wrong, boy?  You'll miss out on flavor.  All right.  He's about to bite into some of the greatest treats of all time, according to Sam's dad. 
[00:49:30]  The middle, not the sides.  There's no...  You're an ass.  He's shaking.  Why are you shaking?  Because this smells horrible.  How is it?  It sounds so dry.  Yeah, I know.  You hear that...  He's making a face.  He's not happy.  Eat the canned fish.  Good.  It's not as bad as I thought it would be.  Oh!  So it is the greatest treat. 
[00:50:00]  It's the onions that is making this worse.  Have another bite.  Mm-hmm.  What is that?  I can't suck down the first part.  Well, wash it down with some buttermilk.  Yeah.  You have a delicious beverage there.  Wash it into the taste.  Huh?  Make it into a nice buttery, salty, milk byproduct, fishy, pasty...  Yeah, wash it down.  Wash it down with some buttermilk.  Enjoy.  A nice sip.  I love this.  There you go.  Come on.  Come on, Iraq. 
[00:50:30]  Let's be drained out of the Trojan.  Here he goes.  Come on, Iraq.  You can do that.  Taking down that buttermilk, washing down that...  Atta boy.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  He's shaking.  He's shaking.  Oh, no.  Have a bite of potato.  Have a bite of potato.  Potato a lot.  That'll help out.  There you go.  A bite of raw potato.  Raw potato.  Raw potato.  Shut up.  A big bite.  Big bite.  Big bite.  That's how Sam's dad does it. 
[00:51:00]  There he is.  Oh, my God.  It's like he just ate a rock.  He just ate a rock.  Listen to that.  Crunch.  Nothing crunches like that.  A potato.  A potato.  How's the raw potato?  That's not bad.  The potato actually is a welcome treat to all of us.  Wow.  All right.  A welcome treat.  So what you do is you go from bad to worse, and by the end, it's a miracle. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  It's the wonderful treat.  Boy, your house must sound like termites, all right, with all of you just eating raw potatoes.  Do you laugh at how much each crunch is?  Do you and your dad like crunch and then laugh?  Let's go to Ryan real fast in Indiana.  Ryan.  Hey, E-Rock, look on the bright side, buddy.  At least your breath smells better now.  Oh, bad breath.  That's not nice.  Hey, you want to dip the sardine sandwich into the buttermilk? 
[00:52:00]  You know how people like to dip their sandwiches a little bit?  A little bit, a little bit.  Or how about a sandwich, E-Rock?  How about another big bite of the sardine and onion sandwich?  Mmm.  Mmm.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  That a boy.  There you go.  He's digging in.  Mmm.  Yummy.  Nice, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's our time, E-Rock.  You're absolutely right.  Is this one of the worst things we've made you do? 
[00:52:30]  It's up there.  I can tell by your face.  His face is red and on the verge of lots of tears.  Some of the world's greatest treats.  According to Sam's dad, yes.  Wow.  How about a sip of buttermilk?  Oh, well, wash it down.  Wash it down.  A little buttermilk.  Wash it down.  Wash that down with some, mmm, delicious buttermilk.  Here we go.  So thick and creamy.  Not quite butter.  Not quite milk.  That's the stuff at the bottom of the bucket in the barn. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  After they lift the cow's filthy udders out.  Are there any black, crusty things that fell off the cow's teeth?  Oh, you got sardine bone?  Oh, sardine bone in your tooth?  Yeah, wash it completely boneless.  Oh.  All right, get a nice sip of buttermilk.  You're eating like a stray cat.  Yeah.  Come on, let's get some buttermilk in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A wash it all down.  Get a good one. 
[00:53:30]  Nice big gulp will wash that right down, E-Rock.  They do scrape the buttermilk, right?  Yeah, they scrape it from the bottom of the barrel.  Oh, yeah.  It smells sour.  Oh, it's all the goodness that's left over.  It's probably a little like cow urine in the milk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's a little of everything.  It might even be some, you know, baby maker in there.  When you look at a cow's udders, there are a lot of nooks and crannies in between the udders,  and what collects in there is this dirt. 
[00:54:00]  Dirt, sweat, sweat.  It's manure.  Yeah.  It's sweat.  It's other stuff.  And it actually forms these flat plates of gunk that fall out into the milk and make black speckles.  And I know that when they do the buttermilk, that's part of the byproduct also that is filtered out and put in the buttermilk.  Yes.  Like hardened scabs in a way of gunk.  That's what makes it so salty, to tell you the truth.  It's the bovine sweat that you're getting from the cow teat.  This is starting to look like rice pudding. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, good.  Enjoy it.  What?  It curdles real fast?  It's getting a little clumpy.  You're going to say that about your waist later, so.  Rice pudding.  That just, it smells like curdled, like cottage cheese.  There's a little cottage cheese that's been left out a little too long.  All right.  Enjoy your treat.  Nice, big, warm mouthful, E-Rock.  Delicious, warm mouthful.  Make sure it's nice and warm.  What a treat.  It's nice to chew.  What a treat, Sam.  That's pushed away. 
[00:55:00]  He's shaking.  Chew your gulp, E-Rock.  Chew it.  Big, big gulp.  That's right.  Swallow that.  Oh, God.  Oh, he didn't quite make it.  Held it in the mouth too long, did you?  Best thing to do, you know, hold your nose and swallow it, then ask him to drop you off.  Oh, God damn.  Look at that garbage, pal.  Oh, it's a mess of buttermilk and sardine bones.  Why don't you bite into the pickle?  Yeah, maybe the pickle will be a good treat now. 
[00:55:30]  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  We haven't even touched the pickle yet.  It's like you're having dinner over Sam's house.  This is great.  Pickle's all right.  What's wrong with the pickle?  Oh, what's the matter with the pickle?  It doesn't go good with buttermilk?  Who would think that a milk and pickle didn't go all together?  Buttermilk.  Buttermilk, yes.  Buttermilk, yes.  Nice, warm, viscous buttermilk.  More sandwich now, I think, right?  Yeah, another big bite.  I was thinking more buttermilk.  What's wrong with you, Jimmy? 
[00:56:00]  Switch it up.  Switch up the order.  A nice, big gulp.  But I hope it's getting warmer under these lights, too,  because it's much better warm.  Then it's like a creamy custard.  It's almost like a custard.  Yeah, enjoy.  Why don't you pour some more of that?  No, I've got enough.  Oh, I don't know.  Enjoy your coagulating beverage.  E-Rog, can you chug the...  Just give us a nice gulp of buttermilk.  It's pre-soured.  Yeah.  Let's play rodeo with the buttermilk. 
[00:56:30]  Let's see if you can keep it down.  Nice, big gulp.  That's a whole shot you got in there.  You should be able to down that entire shot.  There you go.  Come on.  If that was Jaeger, you'd be doing it.  That's right.  All right, here goes E-Rog.  Here you go.  He's got to chug the buttermilk.  All right.  Your beverage is clotting.  This buttermilk is not disappointing anyone.  It's forming skin.  It's horrific.  Oh, on the top?  Yeah.  Oh, no, it's not.  It's forming skin?  All right, we all got...  There's sardine in there.  All right.  Give us a good gulp.  Here we go, E-Rog.  Big gulp. 
[00:57:00]  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  Just sip it.  Nice gulp of buttermilk.  Come on.  All the way.  All the way.  You feel the skin sliding down your tongue?  Ew, I can smell it.  He's gagging.  Good stuff.  Oh, he poured it out.  Well, I think now you've got to refill.  That's right.  He spilled it by accident.  You're spilling it. 
[00:57:30]  Stop.  You're spilling it.  Well, no.  He made all gone with it.  He must love it.  Fill it up again.  Yep.  Another whole big cup of creamy, warm buttermilk.  That's a lot of buttermilk, Sam.  Oh, it's true.  You can't go for a cracker now.  You can't eat the cracker.  No, the crackers go with the buttermilk.  Don't you know how the greatest treats of all time goes?  You're not done with the sandwich yet.  Yeah.  That's the reward, right?  Yes.  You don't get your dessert first. 
[00:58:00]  Clean plate club.  Clean plate club?  What's the clean plate club?  It's when you eat all your meals.  All right.  It's dessert.  You're a member of the clean plate club.  I bet you and your dad have fun with stuff like this.  Yeah.  It's true.  Mm-hmm.  There's a nice, another big bite of his sardine.  He's making a face that says, I love it.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How could you not?  Right at it? 
[00:58:30]  It's wonderful.  Oh, wow.  I've seen crushed glass enjoy more than he's enjoying his meal.  Sounds like the potato.  Yeah, bite into the potato again.  I want to hear the potato.  And some pickle.  Yeah.  And then wash it all down.  With the buttermilk.  Butter, buttermilk.  Get a nice, big bite of the potato for everybody.  It sounds good on the radio.  Yeah.  Margo.  E-Rock can't even really stand up straight.  No, he's shaking.  He doesn't look good.  Sam, it's official. 
[00:59:00]  Your dad is a weirdo.  He actually enjoys this.  Oh, here goes the potato.  Shh, shh, shh.  Here goes the potato.  Raw potato.  Doesn't it sound wet and uncooked?  It sounds awful.  But it's so inviting.  I've never been able to hear something that tastes awful.  Yeah.  That sounds terrible.  This is the best part of the meal. 
[00:59:30]  It kills the taste of everything else.  Oh, good.  All right.  It's a sandwich.  You want to wash it down with some more buttermilk?  Now you've got to wash it all down with a nice brand new cup that he's got.  A lot of delicious milk butter byproduct.  Before the skin forms at the top.  Yeah.  Like when you leave pudding out.  Yeah.  It gets a skin on it, and then you leave it out longer, and it cracks like an earthquake.  Yeah.  Good stuff. 
[01:00:00]  Good stuff, right, E?  Oh, yeah.  Come on, E-Rock.  All right, E-Rock.  It's like drinking out of a giant zit.  If you're just turning in, E-Rock.  He just put the cup down after Jimmy's comments.  He's taking a little more time.  Oh, it is.  Isn't it like pustule fluid?  That's true.  How else can we describe this?  Some kind of sample.  Yeah.  You ever squeeze one that just takes so long, and then it finally gives and just all over  the mirror?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You can do it.  Are you actually chewing the buttermilk?  Some people want to know. 
[01:00:30]  You're supposed to.  Is it lumpy yet?  Not yet.  This buttermilk.  Roll that and around in your mouth.  The buttermilk really changes form pretty quickly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're just turning in, E-Rock is enjoying some of the greatest treats of all time, according  to Sam's dad.  Yes.  This is amazing, because he really doesn't like this.  Well, the buttermilk.  Wow.  Look at that.  It's a big, nice, full cup again.  No.  No.  That's okay.  I've seen it.  You do it.  All right.  It's clobby.  Don't go with a little dabble, do you, either. 
[01:01:00]  We're looking for a nice, big mouthful.  Wait.  Could we have him do a little in his mouth?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little swish it around.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you use the drink that you're washing down everything with to kind of cleanse your  teeth and your palate and your tongue.  Swish it around.  Why don't you swish it out around your mouth a little bit?  Yeah, you should, E-Rock.  Steven S. from Bayshore, usually good with the lines.  He's just writing today, E-Rock effing rules.  No jokes, just saying E-Rock effing rules.  Yeah, swish it around your mouth. 
[01:01:30]  Go ahead.  Before you wash out your mouth.  Looks like he's drinking a tumor.  There.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Now swallow that delicious stick.  It came out.  He can't drink it.  Oh, he can't do it.  Put a mug.  How is this a treat in your house, Sam?  There's a man vomiting from drinking it. 
[01:02:00]  This is supposed to be a treat.  E-Rock, why don't you bite into the potato because that's the only thing that helps you  out.  How about some pickle?  I think that would be helpful, too.  Yeah, just that pickle.  How about a combo?  A little bite of the pickle and a nice big bite of the raw potato.  Yeah.  Is it an acquired taste?  I don't understand.  Acquired.  It's just, it's one of the great treats.  Of course.  Of all time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We figured that out.  I say you enjoy some pickle without the potato first.  I don't like the way you're trying to kill the pickle taste.  I know.  That's cheating and it bothers me. 
[01:02:30]  Get that pickle.  You're wasting.  You seem to like the pickle.  He likes the pickle.  I'm sure he does.  Especially right after the buttermilk.  Ah, the pickle has got to be very inviting, inviting at this point.  He's angry.  What's wrong?  His face looks angry.  Now you don't like the pickle anymore?  Why do you have such an angry face?  I have no taste buds, Lach.  This is burning.  He looks like Little Steven on The Sopranos.  He's making that.  Yes, still.  Yeah, thank you.  I can remember his character, Nate. 
[01:03:00]  And a big.  There he goes.  Eating a granite countertop.  Oh, E-Rock.  We're taking, Ant's taking a video with his flip.  Oh, yeah.  I'll put some of this up on my Facebook later.  And I've been sending pictures out to all the followers on Twitter.  OP Radio on Twitter.  I'm sending pictures out as E-Rock enjoys the greatest treats of all time.  Or some of.  Some of.  Of all time. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I want to know, in time, what some of the other treats are.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Not today, though.  Oh, no.  That would be crazy.  No, we're concentrating on the wonderfulness of the buttermilk.  Around the holidays, your father will enjoy a gravel driveway.  Did he even up the sardine sandwich?  Only half.  No, only half.  Oh, well.  He's got to finish that up.  What do you want to do, E-Rock?  People starving.  We're heading toward a break, but what do you want to do?  I want to die, is what I want to do.  More sardine. 
[01:04:00]  All right, how about one big, how about the grand finale?  Let's go with a, how do you want to do this, Ant?  One big bite of the sardine sandwich.  Yeah.  Throw in the buttermilk and bite down on the potato all at the same time.  Pickle, pickle, pickle.  Pickle, potato.  All right.  He loves that potato.  This is the grand finale.  This is the grand finale.  You know how you see fireworks and you're like, ooh, and then it's finally, you know,  the big, the ending?  Yeah.  Big bite of the sardine onion sandwich.  How do you want to do this?  Bite into the potato and then drink the buttermilk all at the same time or one after another? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, because you want to do it each taste.  Rapid fire.  All right, how about this?  Listen to me closely.  You got the, a big bite of the sardine sandwich.  Bite of the potato.  Drink the buttermilk.  Bite down on the pickle.  End of, end of, end of enjoying the, uh, something crazy.  But one after another.  Yeah, yeah.  I want your mouth full of everything.  Yeah.  Sandwich, potato, pickle, milk.  All right.  No, no, no.  Sandwich, potato, milk, buttermilk, pickle.  Oh.  Yeah.  Atta boy.  End with the pickle. 
[01:05:00]  Here it is.  The grand finale.  And you got to do that until you swallow it.  If you spit it back out, you got to do it again.  Put, put it, get it all in your mouth.  Okay, here's a big bite of that, uh, sandwich.  You're putting the sandwich down.  It sounded like Don Corleone in the tomato field.  And now the, uh, potato.  Nice.  Ow.  All right.  Keep going.  Don't swallow too much.  Milk.  Big mouth full of buttermilk.  Big mouth full of buttermilk.  Big mouth full. 
[01:05:30]  And don't puke.  Don't puke until you get to the pickle.  Hold it in.  All right.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  It's gone.  No, he's trying out.  It's gone.  Oh.  Oh.  Gotta do it again.  Oh, this poor son of a bitch.  And it's just, this isn't even like Fear Factor food.  This is, this is something that Sam's dad eats and enjoys.  It's not just what he enjoys. 
[01:06:00]  What is it, Sam?  These are some of the greatest treats the world has seen.  Yeah.  It's my dad's typical Sunday lunch.  Yeah.  It's like a lazy Sunday lunch.  That's what makes this so great.  I mean, we could do this, we could get the same reaction from Fear Factor crap.  Yes.  This is regular crap.  This is like in ancient times, they would bring the king.  Yeah.  Uh, ice.  Mm-hmm.  They would bring them ice where they would then shave the ice and put sugar cane, uh,  on it.  And they would eat that and it was just the nectar of the gods. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  And that is what I'm assuming, uh, buttermilk and saltines, uh, uh, which he hasn't had yet.  How would they bring the king ice?  Uh, they would go north and then pack the ice in straw and mud to insulate it.  Oh, my God.  And then bring it all the way back to, like, Egypt and stuff.  What?  Ice.  For real?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The king could do whatever the hell he wants.  He's a king.  And then they would shave that ice and put, like, sugar cane that the ships would bring 
[01:07:00]  back from, uh, the Caribbean and stuff.  And they would, uh, um, make it a sweet ice.  Oh, and the king would love it.  He'd lop off a head just because he was happy.  They couldn't figure out how to make their own ice back then.  No, they're not an ice machine.  What are they going to do?  Doc Brown, as a matter of fact, though.  Did make an ice machine in the 1800s.  Yeah.  Uh, but, uh, you know, he's Doc Brown.  Hey, why don't we have Sam's dad on the phone?  He should be calling.  He should.  Maybe after the break.  You guys don't understand.  God and milk is one of the great treats of all time. 
[01:07:30]  Of all time.  Of all time.  Of all time.  All right, E-Rock.  Wow, E-Rock.  You, uh, E-Rock earns his keep around here.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  Not, you know, from work or anything.  No.  I'm just saying it's, uh, and we're going to keep...  Of course not.  We're going to keep the hat bit going.  Uh, this Friday, what kind of hat are we making?  Are we going to go with the cabbage?  I think a hollowed out, uh, piece of cabbage.  But it has to have some kind of adhesive.  So we need something sticky.  Mayo. 
[01:08:00]  Maybe honey.  Mayonnaise or honey.  And then we just slap, and we can cut it like a mohair cut, the cabbage, so it looks  like a green retard hair.  We're making him into cabbage head.  Yeah, cabbage head.  On a Friday show.  To keep the, uh, the hat head fit.  The oldie time football helmet.  Yeah.  All right.  Made of cabbage.  You're right, E-Rock.  No.  Is buttermilk, is that E-Rock?  I have a question.  You want to taste it, Jimmy?  I don't want to, but Dave is lurking, and it looks like he wants some buttermilk.  I'm wondering, is it that bad? 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  He's Jewish.  Is he allowed to do this?  Yes, he is.  It's only buttermilk.  I don't know.  David, come here.  David.  Is it kosher?  I bet you he's not allowed to do this.  Is that kosher?  He's not.  He's not.  David, are you allowed to drink buttermilk?  Yeah.  I don't see why I wouldn't be allowed to.  It's just butter and milk.  It's not anything against the Jewish religion.  All right.  Of course not.  Are you allowed to, uh, do that, though?  Jews?  I think a Jew would be allowed to drink buttermilk.  No, I said, are you allowed?  Oh, am I allowed to?  I would, I think I would be allowed to drink buttermilk.  It wouldn't be anything wrong with it.  It's just a drink.  It's just a drink.  Isn't there something about, why don't you have a ham sandwich, too, you friggin' don't 
[01:09:00]  know anything about the Jews?  I'm not going to drink a ham, eat a ham sandwich, no.  No?  Of course not.  That's crazy.  No, I wouldn't do that, but I'd drink some buttermilk.  And try the buttermilk and tell us what it tastes like.  I want to give you a clean cup, though, not why you actually spit back into it.  Yeah, that's true.  Good looking out.  I wouldn't do that.  All right, we'll do it after the break.  Good looking out.  We'll do it after the break.  No, let's do it now, I guess.  Okay.  Let's hurry up.  We're late for a break here.  That's okay.  We'll catch up sometime.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He puts the hat on.  This kid's prepared.  All right.  David is going to try some buttermilk.  He's smelling it.  What does it smell like, David? 
[01:09:30]  Huh?  Smells like butter.  Jeez.  You got your nose way in there.  It doesn't smell like milk at all.  No.  It smells like butter.  It smells like, it smells exactly like 100% butter.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't.  I'm telling you.  It smells like butter 100%, yes.  They wouldn't have had that reaction if it smelled like butter.  Yeah, it really smells like butter.  There's something else going on with it.  Smells like butter.  It has a bit of sour.  Does it smell like milk?  No, not at all like milk.  No.  All right.  Okay.  Try it out.  All right.  Give it a swig.  Oh, man.  This kid loves his buttermilk. 
[01:10:00]  I've never seen anyone happier to drink anything.  What do you think?  Okay.  It's not that bad.  Well, you know something?  The Hebrew religion, the people that follow the Hebrew religion are not used to good food.  You know what?  It kind of tastes like a liquidy cottage cheese.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It tastes like cottage cheese that you left out a little too long or something. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, like a liquidy, you know.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Disgusting.  Thanks for ruining the segment, Dave, by having no reaction whatsoever.  I'm sorry.  That's perfect.  It's not that bad.  That's beautiful.  Different tastes.  I understand.  Yeah.  E-Rock rules.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  You go to onaradio.com.  It's a bunch of pictures from E-Rock enjoying some of the greatest treats of all time, Anthony.  Very interactive out there.  That's where the pictures are right now. 
[01:11:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Although, Opie, I don't know if I put that under the subheading of good news or great news.  It's very good news.  Wait till you see the picture of the aftermath.  Of all the...  He splattered the greatest treats of all time everywhere.  Like he just blew his brains out.  He's a messy eater.  Jimmy's going to be at Caroline's this weekend, starting tomorrow night.  Tomorrow already?  Wow.  Tomorrow through Sunday.  Wow.  I can't believe it's tomorrow night.  212-757-4100.  I get this whole thing I'm doing with great treats of all time, actually. 
[01:11:30]  It's my closing bit.  Wow.  Where I juggle the sardine sandwich, the potato, the pickle, the buttermilk.  And I ingest them all at once.  Yeah.  Take a bite out of each one as it passes by your mouth while you're juggling it.  Yes.  That's fantastic.  While my toenails are being chewed off by an invalid.  And can we get a mouse update, too?  Just something to think about.  One of the guys in the back office, see if we caught any mice.  We're going to move on, but we're very fortunate to have on our phone right now, Sam's dad.  He's like Edward Norton. 
[01:12:00]  We can only get him on the phone.  He doesn't do it in studios.  Now, this is the beauty of what you just heard on our show.  Sam's dad actually enjoys the greatest treats of all time.  Of course.  E-Rock hated some of the greatest treats of all time.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Listen, what I want to know is, when did my lunch take over Whip-Em-Out Wednesdays?  Wow.  Well, that's a good point.  Believe me, I've seen both.  Yeah.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesdays is better.  Well, of course it is.  It's kind of freezing around here, though, so girls don't really want to whip-Em-Out. 
[01:12:30]  I guess that's true.  The whole WOW movement continues.  We just don't focus as much right now.  But when it gets warmer, we'll certainly focus.  I hope so.  Well, now, E-Rock went through some of your greatest treats the world has ever known.  And while you enjoy them, E-Rock's reaction, well, one of our interns is cleaning up like they cleaned up the back of Kennedy's limo.  You know, I have to tell you, the only thing I can explain about E-Rock is, you know how with wine, you know, it takes a certain mature palate to help that? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  Maybe E-Rock has to continue on.  I don't know.  Has an immature palate.  Evidently.  So you can actually just drink straight buttermilk, like, without the crackers?  Great.  Really, it is one of the great, refreshing drinks.  It's not refreshing.  It smells awful.  Refreshing is something like, if you're working out and you're really thirsty, something thin like water. 
[01:13:30]  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  That's refreshing.  Buttermilk is a heavy, viscous, just, it's not refreshing.  It brings your mucus, just starts pouring out of everything mucus pours out of.  Just a little observation.  You can tell that Sam's dad was an ad man.  How he describes that.  The talent of the beholder.  Yeah.  You're like Larry Tate.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  But if it's really hot, would you come in and have a cool glass of buttermilk to cool off?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  A cool glass of buttermilk on a hot day.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Does it bother you when it gets thick and begins to get the skin on the top?  It doesn't get thick.  What you do is you shake it up and you drink it.  You don't sit there and play with it.  When he sweats, he looks like ash from Alien after he got hit over the head.  White stuff pouring out of him.  Oh, my God. 
[01:14:30]  And you pretty much eat that every weekend.  I would eat it a couple of times.  A month.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's time to reward yourself.  Exactly.  But then you guys probably, you probably wouldn't want to know about Sam's mother's brother  who liked mustard and sugar sandwiches when he was a kid.  Mustard and sugar.  Oh, E-Rock's going to enjoy that.  Wait.  I used to do margarine and butter sandwiches. 
[01:15:00]  Because if we were poor, poor people tend to live in plastic.  Wait.  Mustard and sugar is too...  Margarine and butter or whatever are too similar.  You can almost deal with that.  They're of the same ilk.  Yeah.  But mustard, yeah.  You're confusing the hell out of your palate.  Look how happy he is while he eats it.  Just listen.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Greatest new sound ever.  I'm so jealous you have it.  Love that one.  So butter and mustard.  I mean, mustard. 
[01:15:30]  Is that what you said?  Mustard and sugar?  What kind of mustard and what kind of bread?  Just regular French's, you know, yellow mustard.  Oh, yeah.  White bread.  Oh, yeah.  And granulated sugar.  Sure.  Sure.  I can't imagine those tastes even mixing.  No.  No.  Do you have some of the other greatest treats of all time that you haven't shared with us  yet, Sam's dad?  Well, no.  I mean, I have my own, let's put it, I have my own idiosyncrasies.  I'll just put it that way.  Yeah.  Of things that, you know, that I enjoy, that I've developed over a lifetime of culinary experimentation. 
[01:16:00]  Culinary experimentation.  I love Sam's dad.  He doesn't cook at all.  Oh, well.  No.  Why would you?  If you've noticed, nothing had to be cooked.  You put it all together.  It's all in the combination.  It certainly is.  He could just whip that up.  Yeah.  Your father said, if electricity is, like, removed from our society, your dad wouldn't  even notice what he eats.  No.  None of it matters.  Give him a can opener, he's happy. 
[01:16:30]  Well.  Yeah, good stuff.  Well.  But it is good stuff, as Oak pointed out earlier, you know, nothing, there's not much  better than sardines as far as a health content.  It's one of the best foods you can eat.  That's right.  I just can't enjoy it.  And onions, of course, are terrific.  Potatoes are terrific.  Yeah, but you're washing it down with buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  Buttermilk is great.  Read the label.  The labels don't lie.  You can't even find buttermilk.  Of course you can. 
[01:17:00]  Because we're in a different century.  Read the label of the carton you have there.  Yeah.  You know, they don't tell a lie.  Yeah.  Companies don't lie when they're talking.  Oh, yeah.  You know that, right, sir?  Per serving.  Serving size is one cup.  And you're getting 100 calories.  That's a lot.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  From one cup.  100 calories.  1.5 grams of fat.  1 gram of saturated fat.  10 milligrams of cholesterol. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  340 milligrams of sodium.  Wow.  13 grams of carbs.  10 grams of asbestos.  12 grams of sugars.  But you do get a little bit of calcium there.  30% of your USDA.  Mm-hmm.  Recommended daily allowance there.  That's why I'm not hunched over.  Are you upset that Sam doesn't partake in some of the greatest treats of all time?  I tried to, but Sam is kind of beyond hope now.  But, you know, suffice it to say, Sam has his own, shall we say, idiosyncrasy. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, boy, does he?  He certainly does.  I see a pattern here.  Sam likes fish sticks and little weird things, very specific frozen foods.  Idios pizza.  Yeah.  You like uncooked things.  Is Sam's mom a terrible cook?  That could be it.  Is Sam's mom a terrible, terrible cook?  She is certainly an indulgent cook.  No, she's a ridiculous cook, actually.  Really good?  She makes everything from scratch, like pie crust from scratch. 
[01:18:30]  Well, then why are you guys eating crap out of cans?  I eat crap a couple of times a month.  Well, you want to save it to make it special.  So she's a good cook.  Wouldn't be special if you eat it every day.  She's a very good cook.  Okay.  But she won't come in the kitchen after I have my sardine sandwich.  All right.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Sam's dad, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I'm going to step out of character.  We love your son.  He does a good job for us.  Isn't that grand?  Isn't that grand?  All right.  Okay, thank you. 
[01:19:00]  Grand.  Grand.  Everything's grand.  18.  This guy is so old school.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Quick update from Mars.  The other joint has a mouse problem.  Got a lot of mice.  Yeah.  Mars, what do we got?  What's the update?  Good morning, muchachos.  I'm sorry to inform you.  Nothing.  We have nothing.  What are we doing wrong?  Have you seen any mice this morning?  Smart mouse.  No, I have not seen any mice this morning.  Well, let me ask you a question, Mars.  They moved my trap, which I didn't care for. 
[01:19:30]  Where did they put it?  They put it directly underneath the intern area.  How about they put it back where it was?  Oh, that's good.  Absolutely.  But I think that you would be better off if we move it over to by where the vacuums are.  I'll trust your judgment.  You can move my trap wherever you are.  Yeah, Mars, move the traps around.  We've got a nice bet going on here.  First guy to catch a mouse.  Okay, no problem.  And make sure the traps are working.  Oh, yeah.  I tested him this morning. 
[01:20:00]  The batteries are good.  LEDs go on and all that good shit.  Yeah, we're just...  Whoa!  Technically, he is over there.  Yeah, he doesn't know any better.  They're electric traps, and they're working fine.  All right, Mars, thank you.  All right, we'll be right back.  All right, there you go.  We also have...  We have Otto coming in at 8.  Otto!  Otto!  We'll be joining the show next, I do believe.  But first, it's Black History Month.  Ooh.  We're going to...  We're going to, like...  What are we doing here?  We're what?  We're paying tribute...  Sure.  ...to, I guess, some of the lesser-known black heroes throughout American history. 
[01:20:30]  There you go.  Perfect setup.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African-Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor actor Tony Burton, who played hard-nosed trainer Duke, whose presence in all  six Rocky films collectively adds up to one page of dialogue.  Let's start building some hurting bombs.  Hang in there, Tony.  Unlike Apollo Creed, you didn't die. 
[01:21:00]  There's always a chance you could be back should Stallone choose to make Rocky VII.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  Yeah!  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very happy.  Moving right along, we got Otto from Otto and George in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, by the way.  Anyway, I enjoyed your, um, buttermilk sardine segment.  Ah!  I was having my bowl of Lucky Charms with Diet Pepsi and washing it down with a chicken 
[01:21:30]  salad sandwich with Ben Gay on Wheat Post.  Boy, I got here just in time.  You guys are completely out of ideas.  Jesus!  Nice.  Produced that segment.  Jesus!  I missed you guys, man.  Yeah, we missed you, Otto.  Yeah, that's some of the greatest treats of all time, though.  Do I ever really pop into your head?  Do you guys ever think about me when I'm not right in front of you?  Absolutely.  Are you just busy shoving wads of cash into empty paint cans like Vito on The Sopranos? 
[01:22:00]  Late at night with your piles of money.  I got your DVDs, will you throw them in?  Really?  Yes, of course I do.  I love Otto.  Thank you, man.  So you're on the Facebook, too.  Yeah, I saw that.  Is that good?  Yeah, you know.  Well, we hooked up.  We're pals now on there.  Does George have his own page?  George gets a book out.  George should have his own page.  Yeah.  You should be working two Facebook pages. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  One for yourself, one for George.  Got it.  Yeah.  Are you guys like, what kind of friends are you?  Are you doing the tickle fights and all that other weird stuff they do on Facebook?  I ignore every one of those things.  Yeah.  Ooh, a poke.  You got a present.  You got a kiss.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's a...  You got a heart.  You got a this.  You got...  What's a poke?  I don't know.  I just delete them.  Yeah.  And then everybody's trying to get me into that stupid mafia thing.  What mafia thing?  It's like a game, a mafia mob war game on Facebook, and I'm just like, ignore, ignore. 
[01:23:00]  You come to a part of my family, and I'll do...  Shut up.  Ignore.  When are they going to have the technology to put the image of a computer onto a widescreen TV,  or do they have that yet?  They can now.  Oh, yeah.  They can already?  Oh, yeah.  They got that.  Because every time there's something great on YouTube, I go, I want to see this bigger,  you know?  Oh, yeah.  They've already worked on that?  Oh, good.  My screen is the biggest.  I got an old flat-screen TV.  You know what, though?  My computer screen is an old TV that's easy... 
[01:23:30]  Not old.  It's flat.  It's this big.  But YouTube...  It's a computer screen, or it's a separate TV screen?  It's like a monitor.  Same thing now.  You pop it in, and the quality's wonderful.  Oh, okay.  Progressive scan.  Yeah.  We're living in great times, technology-wise.  Are we?  Technology-wise, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  The thing is, with YouTube videos, though, if you blow them up the size of a big-screen  TV, it's going to be all pixelated.  A little bit.  It was a little, but...  You can press the crap out of it.  Drop out of clarity.  That's all right.  It's all.  Yeah, but you just back up, and you squint a little bit, and man, it's like high-def. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, sure.  Try it.  You think I'm crazy?  Yeah.  Fine.  I haven't been here in a while since your Obama one.  I know you weren't too happy about him.  Nah.  Possibly.  Obama president, nah.  He loves Obama.  Yeah.  Watch it.  He just doesn't know it yet.  Yeah, and I don't think I'm going to know it for at least four and perhaps eight years.  I'm tired of the celebration.  You know, stop the...  You can't dance.  Stop dancing and get on with your job of being president, you know?  Yes.  Really.  That's how I feel. 
[01:24:30]  And this whole celebration thing is like...  It's too show business.  You're a politician.  Yes.  Fix everything that's wrong.  Always try it.  The White House had to actually put out some kind of statement where they're going to try  to curtail merchandising of the president.  Oh.  Because it's gotten ridiculous with the people hawking t-shirts and buttons and stuff.  But doesn't that help the economy?  They should just allow that to continue.  Not down here in Midtown, my friend.  I think if you go uptown, every corner you could buy a t-shirt, a thing with him with a 
[01:25:00]  halo, nailed to a cross, whatever you want to see, the new messiah.  Black people really think that their lot in life is going to change now.  This guy's a politician.  He doesn't care.  Let me ask some of the old ladies up in the Bronx that are being pummeled by some young  gentlemen.  If things have changed since Obama's been in...  They got videotaped they're playing all morning on the news of this lovely gentleman that is  going up and just pummeling old ladies and stealing their money and doing whatever 
[01:25:30]  else.  It is the first black guy to be followed by security outside of a department store.  Rig it.  I thought that was good.  That is good.  Ah, nice.  Where are you going to be, Autumn?  Where should you get the plug in?  Three, huh?  Oh, God.  I got excited.  That's why you're here.  Let's be honest with each other.  I have a performance this time.  No, I didn't come here to plug. 
[01:26:00]  I came here because I feel like I'm vanishing when I'm not in this show.  I'm just somewhere out there in the B-room universe.  And then when I come here, I feel like I'm pertinent again.  Yeah.  You played at Treehouse's, right, Jim?  Yeah, Treehouse's in Saturday with Danbury.  Yeah, yeah.  Stanford.  Stanford.  This Saturday, Otto and George, Treehouse Comedy Club, Stanford, Connecticut.  Get TreehouseComedy.com for tickets.  And all my Long Island friends on February 18th at the brokerage.  In Belmore.  I haven't been there in a while. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Nice little spot there.  It's nice.  They fixed it up.  It's cool.  Yeah.  It's good.  Good show.  What else is going on with you, Otto?  I took a trip to California with Trish.  We did nine days driving from San Francisco to L.A.  That is one of the coolest rides you could ever do.  I know, but I was checking in and out of hotels every two days, and I said to myself,  this is like doing a gig without getting paid at the end of it.  I'm exhausted, and I have less money.  I'm constipated from the change of water.  You know, I was miserable by the end of the trip. 
[01:27:00]  I saw Penn and Teller in Vegas.  They treated me good.  Yeah, those guys.  Yeah.  Did you take the Pacific Coast Highway, man?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a little scary at times.  It is, right, with the cliffs and stuff?  Yeah.  And you stop, and you can hear the seals like a quarter mile down?  Yeah, it's just a pubic hair from death on some of those cliffs there, and people are  like driving up behind us and like...  Yeah, they're mad because you're not going 80 around those turns.  How many people just fly off that road?  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  They just sail right out there into eternity.  They just sail right out there.  There's got to be just an amazing amount of people that just perish on that roadway.  I went to the Hearst Castle.  Boy, did I feel poor after seeing how that guy lived.  Oh, yeah, huh?  Oh, my God.  He had a swimming pool the size of a football field.  Yeah.  And, you know, he had the Marx Brothers over there and all these rich people.  Yeah, it was amazing.  Got some Symbionese Liberation Army pictures of Patty Hearst.  It didn't even occur to me, Patty Hearst, until later on. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Because you were allowed to ask questions on the tour, and I just kept asking him about...  You know, I was trying to do Fatty Arbuckle jokes.  Yeah, yeah.  And the lady wasn't having it.  She was like, oh, oh, Mr. Hearst.  There was a Mr. Hearst.  He's just protecting his name.  What about the Charlie Chaplin stuff also?  Underage, yeah.  The big scandal with the murder on the boat.  Right.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  How about that, you toy guy liar?  He had a big pool.  Did he have Abbott and Costello all over?  And then Lou went, hey, that's a good idea for the art. 
[01:28:30]  What?  Okay.  Abbott, there's a kid in my...  That's why they couldn't get him out.  If he was sitting there, he would have been fine if he could have spit it out.  Abbott, there's a kid in my...  In my...  What are you saying, Lou?  There's a kid in your pajamas?  No, in my...  That's terrible.  Oh, little wispy hairs in the skimmer. 
[01:29:00]  You want to drain it and give it a good acid wash after a kid perishes in your pool.  Oh, Jesus.  Pretty dark.  Yeah, no kidding.  Just a tad.  They really enjoy that, too.  Let them enjoy.  They really enjoy that one.  It's very golden.  You can see them sparkling in the sun when you pick that skimmer basket out. 
[01:29:30]  A little patent leather shoe.  Oh, Christ.  It is just awful, but screw them.  It's old.  It's old stuff.  Enough time's gone by.  I don't care.  They made a ride out of the Titanic.  What do you want from me?  Right.  Yeah, you remember that whole Titanic ride?  No.  You drive around, and occasionally they have these street fairs.  Well, it's right after the movie came out, so it was a hot thing to get for your kids' part. 
[01:30:00]  And it's an actual...  It's the bow or the stern of the Titanic.  Of the Titanic.  And it's a balloon slide.  It's one of those huge inflatable things.  And kids climb up and slide down the deck into water.  Yeah.  And it's like, did you understand that a thousand and some odd people died?  A horrible death.  Yeah, yeah.  And now enough time went by where it's a ride.  Otto, here it is.  Yeah, there it is.  You can bounce off the smokestacks and everything.  Yeah, sure.  Have a little fun with it. 
[01:30:30]  Whee!  Just slide down the deck into water, just like the real people did.  Yeah.  From his, bro.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's acceptable now.  Wow.  Enough time goes by, sure.  Enough time goes by.  You've got to wonder if, you know, eventually there'll be rides from other tragedies.  It's just...  Well, look at that.  There's the little kids sliding down the deck, just having a blast.  And just years ago, people actually were doing that and dying.  And if you get to a really good slide, you slide right into the water.  Oh, fatalities?  Good.  That's good.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  You know, I always put the History Channel on to, like, try and fall asleep before I  do this show, because it's very hard for me to turn my brain off.  There was a thing last night about Hitler's bodyguards.  Oh, that drunk.  Yeah, it was really good though.  That big drunk guy.  They had some good audio on Hitler.  They were...  He was talking to one of his guys, Himmler or something, and he was going, I'm going  to kill six million Jews and 12 circus clowns.  The guy goes, circus clowns?  He goes, see?  Nobody cares about the Jews!  Oh, my God. 
[01:31:30]  You're saying they're dark.  Wow.  Nice.  Sorry.  I really can't.  It's all good.  I'm the same way, though.  I can't fall asleep without something on.  It didn't work.  I was tossing and turning.  Yeah.  You know, when I have nothing to do, I sleep, like, in a second.  But when I have to get some rest to do something, my brain won't shut up.  You're not alone.  Everyone's like that.  You guys must have...  Your bodies must be able to shut down after all these years.  No.  No, you wish.  Ah. 
[01:32:00]  Never.  I just got back into kind of a normal schedule.  I was coming home at noon.  What time did you hit the hay last night, for instance?  Last night was, I don't know, about 9.30.  Really?  But that was normal.  But for about two weeks before this, I was going home at noon, sleeping until 8 at night,  staying up until 2.30 in the morning, and sleeping a couple of hours before the show.  Oh, naps.  So I became nocturnal.  No, the bulk of my sleep was from noon until 8 at night, and then I was up all night just 
[01:32:30]  kind of hanging out, drinking.  Well, that's not bad.  As long as you get your eight hours at some point.  You know what, though?  From 8 till like 2.30 in the morning, no one's around.  There's nothing to do.  I'm not going to go out because then, you know, I'll be out.  But don't you find your brain is functioning better if you're up for a few hours than if  you just crawl out of bed right to the microphone?  Isn't it better?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did notice that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tough to wake up.  I got a glue on my brain when I first wake up.  Well, you're not used to this either.  It's like the funny shirt that I wear this is, I'm a bitch without my coffee. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Hey, Adam, you're a big movie buff.  Oh, yeah.  I just saw The Wrestler.  Man, was that moving.  You liked it?  I thought it was an unbelievable performance.  Oh, Jim, I got to show you this.  Check this out.  Oh, you got a picture of a...  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, a Cy Nicholson.  Yeah.  That's great.  Can I see that?  Who's next?  Can I...  No, no, no.  Don't, no.  I just want to look at it.  Where'd you get that?  I got it.  What, are you jealous?  I got it.  Why are you showing off making us all sad? 
[01:33:30]  I thought Jim would like to see it.  Of course.  I thought it was show and tell today.  I brought something in.  Yeah.  You liked The Wrestler, though, huh?  What, you didn't like it?  No, I loved it.  Yeah, I thought it was amazing.  I mean, really powerful.  But they're saying it's his comeback movie.  Like, what other roles is he going to be able to play with that face and everything?  He's going to do nine and a half Nelsons next time.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, like the...  Prince of paper cuts.  They're saying like John Travolta, the big comeback.  What does this mean to?  Yeah, what do Burt Reynolds do after Boogie Nights? 
[01:34:00]  Zero.  Yeah, they always talk about that.  And he was...  Burt Reynolds shows he could deliver when he's got a good script.  But, you know, there's no script.  There's no scripts.  You see Slumdog.  Slum?  Slumdog Millionaire.  No, no, I heard about that.  That's good.  Is that good?  Millionaire.  I didn't like it as much.  I liked it a lot.  I didn't think it lived up to the hype.  What about Eastwood's movie?  Did you see that one?  I liked it.  That was great.  I just saw the good parts on YouTube.  Oh, it's funny.  Every racist mark out of his mouth.  He's a grumpy old man.  It's like full metal jacket and then like an action movie.  It was great.  I liked it. 
[01:34:30]  Very predictable.  He was saying the vanishing American.  Like eventually everybody's going to be brown, black, and yellow.  And, you know, there's going to be no more guys that look like us eventually.  That's pretty obvious.  That's the dream of some people.  Yeah.  No more white man.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that was a great performance.  I like adult films.  Like the Wrestle was an adult film.  It sounds like children and, you know, talking dog hotel and all that.  Even when I was a kid, I didn't like that stuff.  I always liked Death Wish and stuff. 
[01:35:00]  You know, when I was a kid, it was all about sneaking into an R-rated film.  I was not interested in anything PG.  None of that Disney crap for you?  No.  Yeah.  No, not really.  So you're not going to go see Mall Cop?  Oh, he's very talented.  He's very handsome.  I don't like Pixar animation.  Do you watch that stuff?  I love Pixar.  You mean computer anime?  Yeah.  No, I prefer the old organic claymation, you know, King Kong, the original.  Yeah.  I'm more traditional. 
[01:35:30]  Really?  Where they move like Michael J. Fox?  Yeah.  Those Pixar films are fantastic.  Are they really?  Like, what's a good one to start with if I'm just going to see one?  The Toy Story ones.  The Toy Story's good, yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  What's some of those other Pixar movies?  Uh...  Cars.  Huh?  Yeah, Cars.  Monster Inc.  Monster Inc's good.  Cars is good.  Cars, okay.  Toy Story 2.  Yeah.  Toy Story 2.  And they got the new one.  What is it called?  Credible. 
[01:36:00]  Up is the new one coming out.  What voice is that?  Oh, that's our politician, friend.  You know what?  This is a yes.  You know what?  It's worth playing.  It is so worth just bringing it auto up to speed on this one.  Okay.  No, this is never overplayed, Opie.  Believe me.  This clip can never be overplayed.  What is he, on meds or something?  He just sounds like a dullard?  No, this politician...  I forgot what the debate was about.  It was about beer, obviously.  Do we have the long clip?  A higher...  We did the long clip.  Alcohol content in beer.  Oh.  Yes, yes.  In Alabama.  They're debating a higher alcohol content. 
[01:36:30]  And one of...  This is actually a politician.  Oh.  This is actually a politician that was elected to an office by his constituency.  He's having some kind of press conference or something to try to get this done for his state.  And he's got a crony that I guess helps him out at the end when he can't quite get a thought together.  Yeah.  The cut I have is 21 seconds.  Where's the long clip?  Maybe this is the whole clip. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  I'm going to give it a play.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Mill.  Wow.  Miller.  Cool.  Mill.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  Mill.  Cool.  It's one of our favorite clubs, Otto.  Mushmouth.  This is how it is.  Pat, blue, red, man. 
[01:37:30]  Sheffield.  Mill.  Mill.  Mill.  Dink-a-Lago.  The beer we had, it drank pretty good.  That's a toughie.  Meister Brown.  Summer Grater.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  Chamaine.  Deep South, this guy's from the Deep South.  Oh, the Deep South.  No, he's from Maine, Otto.  Yes, he's a politician. 
[01:38:00]  It reminds me of the other beer clip, too, that we haven't played in a while.  The murder one?  Listen to this.  They was all over a beer.  They was up there.  They had a beer.  They didn't have no beer.  And they won a beer.  They were hanging around to get a beer.  The middle man gave me a dog.  I was just talking.  They were all over a beer.  Guilty.  They took his beer and then shot him.  And they shot him.  And they shot him.  Well, of course.  Over a beer.  This is why I always say we can never, ever quite really sync up as one people in this 
[01:38:30]  nation because there are certain things that I guess we do as white people that black people  don't understand.  And there are certain things that black people do that white people just cannot understand  or be party to or be part of.  I don't like I watch movies where it's like just a group of black guys and they're hanging  out and they're talking and stuff.  And I just think there's no way I could fit into that conversation.  They're just throwing around some cool slang and everything and their clothes and what  they're doing and how they're treating bitches and stuff like that. 
[01:39:00]  And I'm just like, how can whitey fit into that?  And then you got your whitey thing, like my activities, what I like doing, how I like  hanging out with my friends and stuff like that.  And I don't see like, you know, unless you're a black guy that's grown up in a predominantly  white household like Obama can actually understand and fit into that.  Most of them are probably just trying to fit into the pack and they'd love to go to Banana  Republic with you.  Yeah.  They're just trying to be all gangster-ish just to fit in, you know? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, I don't.  Most of them are probably nerdy.  There's got to be black nerds.  I don't think so.  I'm sure they are.  But I think they're more gangster than just like our gangster guys.  You know, their nerds beat our gangster guys, unless, you know, you're talking about the  Italian mob.  Okay, yeah.  But I don't know.  It's just this whole lifestyle thing where it's so separate to me.  I don't understand a lot of what is going on.  Like I watch, you watch on YouTube and you see some videos of this guy, this one guy  who was driving his, one of his bitches down in Detroit and he's videotaping the neighborhood 
[01:40:00]  and they're talking about it and I'm like, first of all, I don't understand what he's  saying.  Secondly, I couldn't do this.  And the way he's treating his bitch, like shut up, shut up, bitch.  Bitches.  It's a different world.  I'd love to treat a woman like that.  How great would that be?  Yeah.  Shut up, bitch.  Who wouldn't want to say that?  But then you get, you know, you get yelled at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do.  I would.  They're not as afraid to go to the slammer for spousal abuse because they're going to 
[01:40:30]  see all their other best friends in the home.  Yeah, yeah.  That's another thing.  It's more part of their normal life is you're in prison, you're out of prison.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a big deal to go away for a while.  We got a question from Eric in Ontario for Anthony.  Oh, a Canadian.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  How's it going?  Good, man.  Anthony, do you base all your racial opinions off of movies?  Off of movies?  Yeah.  Um, no, a lot of them because it's kind of like a reflection of, and I'm not talking 
[01:41:00]  about like watching House Party or anything like that, but it's, you know, a reflection  of the community.  You know, you watch movies based on whitey and you get kind of the whitey angle.  You watch movies based on black people and you get kind of a black angle.  I like a movie like that, Menace to Society, things like that.  Colors.  Colors.  Good movie.  Colors.  You watch things like that, and it's not, that isn't out of the question that people  do talk like that, act like that. 
[01:41:30]  I know it's a drama, so there's a lot more action in it than probably would be in the  normal run-of-the-mill life of a black gentleman in South Central, but I couldn't imagine living  in that lifestyle.  So, I can't find common ground.  I can't find common ground.  We're a separatist society, really.  We really are.  It's a lot to do with age, too.  I'm sure a guy like Morgan Freeman looks at those kids and just goes, what the hell,  you know, what are they doing? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, well, Bill Cosby's always been very vocal on that and say, pull your pants up and  speak properly.  But, I don't know, it's just this whole...  You have a lot in common with them.  You're gaudy, you like guns, you drive an oversized vehicle, you like to bang young chicks.  That is true.  You completely have everything in common with them.  The difference is, I do it all legally.  It's my vehicle.  My guns are registered.  The girls aren't under 18. 
[01:42:30]  Stupid, frightened white man.  Exactly.  Let's go to John in Indiana.  John, we're hanging with Otto and George today, who's going to be at the Treehouse Comedy Club  in Stanford this Saturday, treehousecomedy.com.  Hello.  Yeah, go ahead, John.  Hey, I want to get a linger longer with Boo Got Shot.  Well, we're heading toward a break.  You want to do Boo Got Shot today?  Boo Got Shot.  You've heard Boo Got Shot, right, Otto?  I haven't.  That's a very famous clip.  I haven't yet, no.  You want to do it with the translation or without the translation?  I like without.  All right. 
[01:43:00]  Figure it out yourself.  Otto, there's a murder that went down.  Okay.  And they got an eyewitness to Boo getting shot.  We got it yet?  Mm-hmm.  And this is how she described what she saw.  Thank you.  Boo Got Shot.  She was shaking real bad news.  Pitches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  I said, oh, my God, oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody up here.  She called my cousin, Punkin, just failed us.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with police.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out, and she went and got in her car, and she bailed out. 
[01:43:30]  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again,  when I heard the gunshot, and I seen some boy had run in the building over it that way.  He ran in that building.  I seen that car that flew off, and then I seen a long gun, a big old gun in the car.  My sister's cousin, you called police, and they said an ambulance.  An ambulance.  Call my sister's cousin an ambulance.  Could you possibly imagine hanging with that chick?  No.  Like going out on a date. 
[01:44:00]  The way you have gone out on dates and hung with girls and done that,  could you possibly imagine taking her out and getting common ground?  It's a nice fantasy, though.  It was a good description.  I'm talking one, maybe two times.  I'm not talking, like, going steady.  Look, I'm talking about finding anything you can talk about while sitting across from each other at a table.  I wanted to go ghetto so bad.  Yeah.  Never got it done.  That's such bad jokes. 
[01:44:30]  She'd say, Boo got shot, and you'd say, what caliber weapon?  What caliber?  Okay, perhaps.  You have a wonderful conversation.  Perhaps we could go that direction.  Just talk about firearms all night.  We've got to find the clip.  We haven't played it in years.  I don't even know if we have it anymore.  The Bambulance.  The guy with Bambulance.  We need Bambulance.  I think what happened was a deer.  This guy hits a deer, was it?  Yeah.  Went through his windshield.  Went through his windshield.  No, it was a moose.  Was it a moose?  It was a moose where the moose was sitting.  The woman hit the moose.  Oh, no, no.  That's another one.  Oh, okay.  That's a great picture.  Yeah, the moose is, his ass is sticking out of the windshield. 
[01:45:00]  But I think it was a deer.  He hits the deer.  Oh, he hit it, and he put it in the back seat.  Oh, okay.  That's what it was.  He hits a deer, he decides to pull over, and he figures this is some good eats.  Dead deer.  Oh, okay.  So he puts it in the back seat, and as he's driving down the highway, the deer comes to.  That's Tommy boy.  Yeah, but I think it's based on a real story, because we used to play the clip, and the 911  calls.  This guy going, screaming and yelling, going, I need a Bambulance.  I need a Bambulance. 
[01:45:30]  The deer's in the back seat.  He's alive.  Right.  If we could find that.  What's Bambulance, an ambulance for Bambi?  Maybe that's what he meant, okay.  We've got a break with that.  Otto and George killing with us today.  Opie and Anthony.  We're on here.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got Otto from Otto and George in studio.  George stays home now.  We kind of like that, in a way.  I thought of bringing them today, but then again, you know, this guy goes into a deli  and orders a ham and Swiss. 
[01:46:00]  He goes, I'll have a ham and Swiss on rye, no mustard.  And the guy goes, we're out of mustard.  Would you like that without mayonnaise?  Jesus.  Otto and George at the Treehouse Comedy Club in Stanford, Connecticut, this Saturday.  TreehouseComedy.com.  And then for all the Long Islanders listening, February 18th, brokerage in Belmore.  You can see Otto and George.  That's going to be a good show.  Yeah, we've got lots to do still, but Jill's on the line from Blairstown, and it says, 
[01:46:30]  Ant is so funny.  I think it's probably going to be sarcastic.  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Jill?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Jill.  Hi.  I've been listening for actually just a couple of months.  Why?  But, Anthony, you crack me up.  Like, you're so ignorant that it's just hysterical.  Like, I can't even be mad at you.  He really is, right?  I knew it.  The ignorance is ridiculous.  What am I ignorant about, Jill?  And he's a very intelligent man. 
[01:47:00]  One of the smartest guys I know.  No, enlighten me.  I want to know what I'm ignorant about.  No, you're very smart.  And just this whole, everything about races and it's so funny.  Like, I can't even be mad.  You just crack me up.  But how is, okay, hold on.  How is my opinion on how the races are and how they act together and things like that,  how is that being ignorant?  I'm basing it on something. 
[01:47:30]  And there is kind of an opinion on the whole thing.  I'm not saying it's...  I mean, you're definitely entitled to your own opinions.  I mean, I'm not, you know, everybody can say whatever they want to say.  But it's just, I don't know.  It just seems like you get your information off of the most, like, stereotypical movies and, like...  Websites.  Well, no, no, no.  I also, like, I look at the world.  I look at, like, people. 
[01:48:00]  I'm a people watcher.  I do that.  It's not just based on movies.  I'm not that crazy.  But...  Well, were you beat out by a bunch of black guys, like, every day?  You know, I grew up, I went to school in Central Islip at one point in my life out of Long Island.  And it's known to not be one of the best neighborhoods around.  And I did have some problems with some black gentlemen back then taking my money.  They would always love taking the white kids' money. 
[01:48:30]  Are you really just a sad little boy at heart?  You just need some love.  No.  Why can't it be...  Jill, why can't it just be that this is the way it is?  And I'm just kind of talking about what it is.  While we were talking about this, let me just enlighten you a little bit.  While we're having this conversation, I'm distracted by the news watching a savage beat the living crap out of an old lady.  They're both black. 
[01:49:00]  It's black-on-black crime, which, by the way, is 90% of the crimes that black perpetrate are against other black people.  That isn't my opinion, by the way.  I didn't say it was.  That's the way it is.  Why would you say that is?  Why is there a disproportionate amount of crime in the black community than in the white community or any other ethnic groups?  I think that they just publicize it more. 
[01:49:30]  All right, so you say it's the media.  No, it's not.  It's statistics that are collected by the FBI, by the prisons, that there is a disproportionate number of crimes that are committed by black people.  Right.  As opposed to white people.  It's a fact because that's what they do.  Yeah.  Like, but it's a fact that that's the information that they collect.  We don't know what goes on in white people's houses. 
[01:50:00]  So you're saying it's a conspiracy.  No, the clip you just played of the woman talking about somebody that got shot and blah, blah, blah.  Do you know how many trashy white people walked this way?  I'm not saying that every...  Right.  Hey, Jill.  Jill.  Jimmy, I'm going to shoot you.  Why?  I just...  Jill, Jill.  See, here's what the thing is.  I'm not saying there aren't dumb-ass white people.  As a matter of fact, there are more dumb-ass white people than black people because there are more white people in the country. 
[01:50:30]  I'm talking 10 or 11 percent of the population of this country account for 50 percent of the prison population.  How is that possible without there being a conspiracy?  Jill?  Just the way they report it, right, Jill?  Shut up, Jimmy!  God, you son of a bitch!  All I'm saying is...  How is that, Jill?  All I'm saying is I'm not trying to get into all these serious facts.  It's just...  No, you called me out on something.  I want to have an intelligent debate. 
[01:51:00]  You said I'm ignorant on a lot of things.  I want to have an intelligent debate with you on this subject.  Why do you think 50 percent of the prison population is made up of 10 percent of the country's population?  Jill?  It's just the way it is.  Okay.  Well, why is it like that?  I need an answer.  I say...  Well, I'm not saying...  Because there's this...  I'm not disagreeing with you.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not disagreeing with you. 
[01:51:30]  So then why am I stupid?  I'm just saying that some of the...  I didn't say you're stupid.  Well, why am I then ignorant?  I bring these things up.  I bring up the crime.  And I bring up the fact that we don't have common ground because of things like what I just mentioned.  And then I'm called ignorant.  I'm not talking about your facts.  I'm talking about the plain old...  Mm-hmm.  That you wouldn't be able to fit into a conversation with a bunch of black guys.  I couldn't.  Why is that funny?  Do you... 
[01:52:00]  Look...  Why?  Because I don't understand.  I don't have a common ground with a group of black people.  I can't step into that.  You certainly can.  Unless they...  You're talking about the ghetto guys.  I am.  And the hardcore rap guys.  That's what I'm talking about.  There's a lot of other black guys out there.  How many ghetto black guys do you run into?  Yeah, really?  I know.  I steer clear.  Because it's dangerous.  Another great point from Jill, right?  It's dangerous for white people to be around a black criminal element.  As much as it would be for a black gentleman to be around a group of skinheads. 
[01:52:30]  It's dangerous.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, I love getting you all around.  I know.  Don't you?  Yeah, because you're really doing it.  Not the bastards that are surrounding me right now agreeing with you.  Well, you know, it's been a good point here.  Hold on, Jill.  You raised a good point about the stereotypical.  Which one, Jimmy?  There's a lot of them.  A lot of times, right?  He just kind of gets his stuff from movies, right?  Yeah.  I noticed that, too.  Shut it, Jimmy.  Before I go, before I go, I just want to say, Jimmy, I love you. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, thanks, sweetie.  Shut up.  Jimmy, that liberal ass.  Thank you, sweetie.  He's a lib, you liberal Democrat jackass, Jimmy.  What am I going to do?  That's what we call him.  We call him liberal tree-hugging Jim.  Hold on.  I'm a Jill hugger.  Pass along the wealth.  Let's spread it around.  Jill, what do you look like?  He's funny, and he's very witty, and I love him.  Thank you, baby.  Is that it?  Jill, what do you look like, Jill?  Jill, how much do you love black?  Hey, hey.  Do you just love it?  Do we have to go there?  Do you just love it?  Do we have to go there?  When did your father disown you, Jill? 
[01:53:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  Let's keep it fun.  Oh, I have a very loving father.  Ah, right.  I'm kidding.  I'm sorry.  Jill, are you a pretty girl?  What?  Pretty girl are you, Grady?  Pretty girl are you, Mr. Grady?  You chopped liberal Jill up and left her body in the hallway.  There you go.  That's what I like to hear.  Nice and dirty.  She was talking to her cook.  Everybody say hi to my husband, Ben.  I'm sure he's listening.  He's very proud of me, right?  All right.  He's talking about something with Jimmy. 
[01:54:00]  I'm sure he's very proud right now.  Go see Jimmy at Caroline's this weekend, Thursday through.  Sunday, I do believe.  God, people just can't be honest.  I know.  Everyone that says Ann is wrong has never worked.  Oh, hold on.  I'll read them all out for you.  Yeah.  Shane and Philly, just to see what's going on out there.  Everyone that says Ann is wrong has never worked with black people.  These are opinions that people have gotten through experience, whether it's right, wrong,  or indifferent.  This is what people are living.  Brennan in San Diego.  Ann is giving facts.  She's calling them theories. 
[01:54:30]  Michelle in Rockland County.  I understand both sides, but Jill shouldn't attack Ann.  Chris in Missouri, smartest black people can also be ghetto.  Tony, black guy from D.C.  Ann watches movies and thinks we're all the same.  Well, can we have a guy?  I think a guy like Tony and Ann would be very interesting.  I watch movies and think they're all the same.  Hold on a minute.  Jim, in Long Beach, I'm a cop.  Jill is the ignorant one.  Scott in D.C.  Ann, I think you're ignorant, too, but I love it.  And Paulie from the NYPD, I want to back up Ann with facts. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Well, Tony from D.C.  Tony, you're on the OPS.  Hey.  Hi, Tony.  What's up, Tony?  What's going on, fellas?  What's up, man?  Hey, Ann.  Yeah.  This guy, Ann, I mean, I love this show.  I've been listening for years.  Thank you, sir.  But Ann just has been going further and further down the crazy trail.  Yeah.  The longer the years have been going on.  Look, Ann, I wouldn't fit in to minister society, okay?  Yeah.  Most black people wouldn't fit in in minister society. 
[01:55:30]  That is a crazy, ultraviolet movie, you know?  Yeah.  But to say that, that's the same thing as a white black person hanging around skinheads.  Skinheads kill black people.  Yeah.  Black people, if you go around black people and you hang around with some black people,  they'll just say, what is that guy doing in the hood?  You know, but they're not going to go up and test your balls or anything, you know what I mean?  I think if I try walking through East New York on a Saturday night, I am getting effed up, dude. 
[01:56:00]  I am getting effed up.  If I walk past certain street corners, I'm a dead man.  I'm done for.  It's just the way it is.  That is, yeah.  Most of the violence, like you said, most of the violence is black people on other black people.  Yeah, that's because white people aren't around in those areas.  White people are around, but if you hang around any bad neighbor, if I walked around a trailer park on a Saturday night, 
[01:56:30]  I mean, hell, I might get, you know, I might get messed up.  You're right.  I might get killed.  That's my whole thing is we're still a very separatist society because I don't think we can find common ground.  What's, Tony, give me a brief, like, what is your Saturday night like?  What do you do on a weekend?  On a weekend?  I sit at home, to be honest.  All right.  I sit at home.  Who's home?  Huh?  Oh, man.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh, man, come on.  I like Tony.  Come on.  What is that?  We got an opportunity here. 
[01:57:00]  Come on.  He's actually making very valid points.  What is that?  Dude, I'm a fan.  No, I just sit home, to be honest.  You know, I might go to a bar every now and again, but it's nothing crazy.  Like, we don't stand on the corner and talk about our bitches and, you know, all of this stuff.  That's just, that's rap videos, man.  You can't take the, and with Ant, another thing is that he's corrupting all of you guys.  I'm sorry to say it, but he does the same thing with the liberal and conservative debate. 
[01:57:30]  Shut up, dude.  He's one crazy person who says something crazy, like, Obama's going to pay my mortgage, and  then says, this is how liberals think.  Oh, they're doing the same thing about Hitler.  Like, he was crazy and was going to influence people.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not the same thing.  Right.  Of course not.  Come on.  And you see, Ant goes down the crazy trail.  All the time.  Oh, my God.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  There's Ant going down the crazy path. 
[01:58:00]  No, I like Tony.  That's because I expected, you know, what do you do on the weekend?  You hang out.  You drive around and chop down Chevys.  But how could you like Tony?  He's black.  With some weapons in there.  You can't possibly like Tony.  And just hassle the police when they pull you over.  That's what I expected.  No.  All right.  Well, but see, we talk back to the police because they're always around.  Yeah.  And when they're not, there's a problem.  No.  If you lived in a neighborhood where the police were always around, always stopping people 
[01:58:30]  for no reason.  They drive past my house all the time.  They give me a wave and then they're off.  They're called patrolling.  Get out of here.  It's called patrolling.  Yeah, but you're paying them.  They're like your private security or something like that.  Well, not too far off there, Tony.  I love the police.  Are you kidding?  They're fantastic.  You know what happens, though?  In some of the communities, the black communities, the cops can't win because if they're not  there, there's people bitching that there's crime and drug sales going on and the cops 
[01:59:00]  aren't there to stop it.  And then when the cops show up and start busting these guys, people come out and go, oh, look  what they're doing, they're dragging off, you know, our young men.  So it's very hard for the police to win in those situations.  It's not hard.  Here's the thing.  Why don't you just treat them with respect when you get pulled over and say, yes, sir,  no, sir, here's my license, my registration.  Well, most black people feel like they're being treated unfairly anyway when they're pulled 
[01:59:30]  over by the police.  I mean.  I get pulled over more than the brothers.  I swear I get pulled over more than the brothers.  But you get pulled over and you get to stay in your car.  You know, when we get pulled over, they say, get off the car, get on the ground, get on  the knees, you know, and it's like face down on the curb.  And after, you know, five or six times of being put on the street face down, then you're  like, maybe you might feel a little, you know, a little chip on your shoulder after a while.  But when you get pulled over, they say, excuse me, sir, can I have you? 
[02:00:00]  You were going fast.  Could you please give me your license to register?  And you get to sit there with your heat on and then you say, thank you all for the time.  You're not laying in the street.  It is cool being white, I got to say.  Getting a cold chin.  God damn.  I like this Tony guy.  Tony, you're all right, man.  I get you know what it is, though.  Why would the cops do that unless there was this disproportionate amount of crime?  Are they profiling?  Perhaps.  But if you go out and you're attacked by anything that is the same every time, wouldn't you then 
[02:00:30]  be a little more leery in those circumstances?  And here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Nixon, I'm going to use a Nixon quote.  Nixon said that because the president does it, that means it's not illegal.  Just because the police pull people out of their car and put them on the ground doesn't  mean it's a reason for it.  Hey, Tony, can I ask you?  It could just be jerk-offs.  Hey, Tony, can I ask you a question?  I agree.  Like, you know how you say you'll give the cops an attitude sometimes because your experience  with cops has been kind of unpleasant, so you kind of will prejudge them when they pull 
[02:01:00]  you over.  Right.  Doesn't it kind of work the other way, too?  Like, if a lot of cops work in certain neighborhoods and have had primarily bad experiences with  black people, or most of their bad experiences have been with black people, how come it's  wrong for them to kind of prejudge?  No, it's okay.  But here's the thing.  I would like for white people to at least acknowledge that that may be going on.  See, asshole thing is, if the police pull you out of your car and put you on the ground  and, you know, maybe kick you around a little bit, then maybe it's a reason for it. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  But it's never a reason, you know, it's never the other side, and it never sees the other  side.  True, it may be some cops who have bad experiences, that's why they act that way.  And it's some black people who have bad experiences, that's why they act that way.  But just acknowledge both of them.  And just say, you know, people get pulled over.  What you want, MFA?  I don't think it's like, I don't think every time they're dragging every black guy out of  the car and putting them on the street either.  But don't you think that maybe if, as a community, you guys could get together and realize that 
[02:02:00]  if you clean up, like, you clean up some of the crap that's going on in the community, that  the police wouldn't hassle you as much.  Where did that come from?  I mean, obviously there was an initial prejudice there, but hey, we got a black president.  So I think if everybody just strives to be law-abiding citizens, drive nicely, and not have drugs 
[02:02:30]  and illegal firearms in the vehicles, not roll the window down and have a ton of pot smoke  come out, maybe things will change.  Again, I love that Snoop Dogg video, too.  I got it from a Snoop Dogg video.  But see, that's not the thing.  It's always going to be people who break the laws, unless we all act like ants.  You know, unless we all have our roles to play.  We don't question. 
[02:03:00]  We just do, you know, what we're supposed to do.  But that's never going to happen, because we're people.  I hear you.  I mean, we're a-holes by nature.  So, you know, most people don't want to do the right thing when they're supposed to be  doing it, you know?  Yeah.  We got to go to break, Tony, but definitely...  Thank you guys, though.  Great talking to you.  I like the points you made.  Yeah, Tony, call back any time.  You were real good, man.  Very cool.  Tony in D.C.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll do a little mopping up in just a bit.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  We got to get out of here.  They're ready to start the music marathon here in New York City.  And we're going to go over to SiriusXM and do some cursing, check our mousetraps, and  spend more time with Otto from Otto and George.  Yep.  This Saturday, Otto.  Treehouse Comedy Club, Stanford, Connecticut.  Another fine appearance today by yourself.  Thank you.  Yes, very good.  And then the brokerage, February 18th, for everybody out there on Long Island.  Anything else?  And then Caroline, this is tonight?  No, tomorrow. 
[02:04:00]  It's Sunday.  Yeah.  212-757-4100.  I'll be there.  And my whole new thing that I've been doing, we're really physical comedy.  I've been kind of doing this improv thing where I bring people on stage and we act out  of scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really funny.  Shut up.  That's great.  I'm like, what's the occupation?  Someone will be on a job.  Abortion doctor.  All right.  Please.  All right.  You're an abortion doctor.  Yes.  At a deli.  Go.  Yes.  That looks like, I'll have a slice of what looks like my last job. 
[02:04:30]  That's a pimento.  I want to thank Sam.  He's gently sucking the pimentos out of the olives.  I meant to say olive loaves.  I'm such an idiot.  Pimento is good.  That works.  I tripped into a good one.  And Sam, of course, for bringing in the greatest treats of all time.  Or some of the greatest treats of all time.  Sam's dad got to thank him.  Yeah.  Pictures are up on onaradio.com. 
[02:05:00]  And we're working on the videos.  They'll be around tomorrow, I assume.  A lot of puking.  E-Rock just couldn't handle some of the greatest treats of all time.  Because we mentioned it, we leave you today, just before the music marathon, with the  I Need a Bambulance phone call.  Right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Family.  This is the ambulance emergency line.  Do you have an emergency?  I need a Bambulance.  Who is this?  Joe.  Okay.  Where do you need us?  I'm in the phone booth.  Okay.  What's the address there? 
[02:05:30]  Hold on.  Okay, sir.  Did you call 3-9-1-1?  Uh, no.  Okay, Joe.  I need a location.  What street are you on?  Uh, I'm in the phone booth at the stop and go.  Yeah, I'm at the, that's it.  I'm at the stop and go.  Well, I'm in the phone booth.  Let me tell you what.  I'm going down to my road, driving my car, minding my own goddamn business, and a deer jumping  out and hitting my car.  Okay, sir.  Are you injured?  Now, let me tell you.  I get out and pick the deer up. 
[02:06:00]  I thought he's dead.  I put the deer in my back seat, and I'm driving down to my road, and minding my own business.  The deer woke up and bit me in the back of my goddamn neck.  They bit me, and they done kicked the out of my car.  I'm in the phone booth.  The deer bit me in the neck.  A big dog came up and bit me in the leg.  I hit him with the tire iron, and I stabbed him, I stabbed him with my knife, so I got  a hurt leg, and the deer bit me in the neck.  And the deer, and the dog wanted me out of my phone booth, because he wants the deer. 
[02:06:30]  Now, who gets the deer, me or the dog?  Okay, sir, are you injured?  Yeah, a deer bit me in the neck.  Hold on.  The dog is blazing me.  Hold on.  Goddamn him.  Get out of here.  Hold on.  The dog is blazing my ass.  Hold on.  All right, continuing with the O.P. and Anthony show, Otto from Otto and George has made the  walk.  Some of you guys, you don't make the walk.  We like when we see you make the walk. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Otto continues with us.  All right.  Got a nice audience filing in.  Ooh.  Onto the bleachers.  And mousetrap's still nothing, huh?  What the fuck?  You'd think there were no mice around here.  That's becoming a bust.  We know that the place is infested with rodents.  I think they got the exterminator coming in tomorrow, too, so...  Oh, game over.  Bit is going to be over tomorrow.  Fuggas.  Fucking wankers. 
[02:07:30]  There's a couple things we couldn't get to because we had a lot of action.  It went fast over there today.  A lot of action.  Yes.  That's the sign of a good, solid program.  I know Jimmy likes a good comic strip.  They're fucking so funny, man.  You enjoy a good comic strip.  Yeah, I do.  And there's something going on with Dilbert that's making a lot of news today there,  Jimmy.  Oh, right.  I miss you reading the comics, by the way.  It's been a while.  Nah, that's too funny.  I get all laughed out.  Sure.  Do you want me to tell you what happened to Dilbert, or should we play the audio and 
[02:08:00]  have the big surprise?  Let's play it, because Dilbert always gets me.  He always catches me off guard.  Dilbert is what?  Is he like an office space type?  It's that office humor.  Office humor.  It's office humor, cubicle humor, bosses and sub-bosses and all that kind of crap.  Secretaries.  Paperwork.  Cubicle crap.  TPS reports.  PC load letter.  PC load letter.  What the fuck that means?  I got to watch office space. 
[02:08:30]  PC load letter.  That was the one.  I never was freaking out over it.  What the fuck?  I never got office space, and everyone's like, you got to watch it a couple times, yeah.  So I'm going to give it another try, but Dilbert is in the news and his comic strip.  Listen to this.  And it's your sign of the times.  Cartoon character Dilbert has been fired.  Dilbert has been fired, Jimmy.  What did Dilbert do again?  Oh, no.  I think it's because of the economy, you know.  You got to be relevant with your comic strip, right? 
[02:09:00]  This has got people talking.  A symbol of the downtrodden worker, Dilbert.  Says, my side business, DilbertFiles.com, is getting lots of attention.  I have a feeling I will soon be leaving my cubicle behind, all in favor of firing this  idiot for using company resources.  What?  I don't even know what we just heard.  What was that?  What the fuck does that mean?  No, it's in parts, but...  Did Dilbert get fired?  Did he stop running that shitty comic strip? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, what happened?  Did the guy get fired?  Sam, you're making everyone angry today.  What the fuck is going on with Dilbert and his stupid comic strip?  What the fuck?  Well, you guys are probably just like...  Because it's very funny.  You've got to listen to it again.  What they did was they read...  That's an asshole.  They read the Dilbert gets fired comic strip, and the last box of the three panels, the last  panel is his bosses saying, should we fire him?  And so that's where I ended the clip, so that way you guys could laugh and not... 
[02:10:00]  Oh, oh, oh, and then we're going to find out...  Right, and then there's some more audio after that, but I wanted to end the clip there, so  you guys had a minute to laugh.  But what is Dilbert?  Okay, thanks for putting a little break in this so we can laugh.  But wait, Dilbert...  Appreciate that.  They might fire the guy...  The character.  Who gives a fuck?  Not the guy that writes the thing.  No, no, no, the character, Dilbert, is getting fired, so now we're going to have to follow  his adventures of trying to get a job.  Or misadventures.  Misadventures.  Of trying to get a job.  Fucking Sam, man.  What does he do now? 
[02:10:30]  He's an office worker.  He's going to be sucking cock down in the meatpacking district.  How about Dagwood gets arrested for rape?  And fucking Blondie goes to defend him?  That would be a great fucking shit.  Where Peppermint Patty is caught eating pussy?  He's fucking eating Lucy's ass in the doghouse?  That would be a great little twist in a comic strip.  Oh, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Love to see that.  Where Marmaduke jumps into the family circus and fucks the kid's face.  He gets chlamydia from Pigpen.  Doesn't wash his cock. 
[02:11:00]  He's unclipped.  Wasn't he like a Polak?  So, let's take Sam's advice and let's replay this.  Yes!  Let's see where this is going.  Because he gives us time to laugh.  All right, now we've got the setup.  Now this might make sense.  And in a sure sign of the times, cartoon character Dilbert has been  fired a symbol of the downtrodden worker.  Dilbert says, my side business, DilbertFiles.com, is getting lots of attention.  I have a feeling I will soon be leaving my cubicle behind.  All in favor of firing this idiot for using company resources? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, so that was the panel with the bosses?  He's sitting there.  So Dilbert's sitting there going, well, I've created this side business while I'm at work  that's going to enable me to leave my job and, you know, become a successful millionaire  on my own.  Right.  Little does Dilbert know that in his head he's saying, I'm going to be out of here soon,  but he's going to be out a little sooner than he thinks.  Oh, Sam.  Wow, Sam.  The way you put it.  Right.  All right.  Scott Adams is the man, the cartoonist, and the blogger behind the character. 
[02:12:00]  Scott, why did you pick this moment in time for Dilbert to lose his job?  Gee.  Boy, I wonder.  I wonder why.  Because everyone's losing a job.  Fucking shit.  And he wants to have Dilbert relate to the people, man.  So, fuck.  It's the smart move.  Tessio was always smarter.  Dilbert was always smarter.  Dilbert, ugh.  Pick you up in front of Dilbert's joint in an hour.  This moment in time for Dilbert to lose his job, and quite frankly, he was using company 
[02:12:30]  resources.  It's a terrible thing to lose a job, but didn't he deserve to get fired?  Well, you know, his company was slowing down just like everybody else's company is slowing  down, and he didn't have much to do, so he started a side business in his cubicle.  That guy sounds like a Napoleon Dynamite.  Which is, you know, what a lot of people believe, including myself.  He does.  He does sound like a Napoleon Dynamite.  Dilbert should get it in the head, like the Turk.  Why don't you just drop me on the way after, or whatever? 
[02:13:00]  In business in his cubicle, which is, you know, what a lot of people did, including myself.  And he got caught.  So, it just seemed like you had time to downsize him and let him see what it's like to try  to get a job in this economy.  God, what a bore.  Oh.  Well, you know.  That's how it's like to get a job in this economy.  I mean, I'm with Sam here.  This is a treat for everyone.  Is he going to just, like, be looking for a job, or is he going to take a little time  off and hang around the house for a little while? 
[02:13:30]  What do we see?  A lot of people are asking that question.  Are they, Sam?  And in this next track, we find out.  Wow, okay.  Does your dad enjoy a good comic strip when he's eating some of the greatest treats of  all time?  I don't know.  He does have the Sunday paper by his side while he's eating these treats.  I bet he likes Beetle Bailey.  One of some of those old comics that have been around for a thousand years.  Brenda Starr.  Brenda Starr still hot in comic strip form.  Is he going to get brought back really fast, or are you going to have a long-running storyline 
[02:14:00]  where he's now looking for a job and get a lot of humor out of that?  But I will tell you that, you know, I can't give away too much.  I will tell you that when he comes back, it won't be in the same capacity.  So you guys, I can't wait to see him.  Oh, motherfucker.  Wow.  Now I've got to start reading the Dilbert comic.  We're going to learn three panels at a time.  For the next five years, we'll chronicle his fucking two job searches.  Three effing panels at a time.  How fucking boring. 
[02:14:30]  What do they stop with fucking comic strips?  No one laughs when they read them.  It is nobody.  It is an archaic form of entertainment that was relevant in the 20s.  Get us a newspaper.  What are you talking about, Jimmy?  They hurt my throat.  Is that today?  Now, is that in today's paper, Dilbert, getting fired?  Or has that maybe happened already, and now we can get an update by reading today's paper?  Sam?  That's a very good question.  I think, Sam, you should be on top of the whole Dilbert thing and bring us updates from time to time. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  I will give you Dilbert updates.  You will be on Dilbert connection.  Has he been fired?  Dilbert has been fired.  Officially, he's been fired.  Dilbert's jobless.  I mean, the listeners are going to be begging for the Dilbert updates out there, Sam.  Make sure you don't disappoint our fine listeners.  Maybe he'll shoot himself and his family.  That would be great, wouldn't it?  We don't have a Dilbert today, but we have Beetle Bailey today.  Fuck Beetle Bailey.  Dilbert? 
[02:15:30]  The New York papers don't have Dilbert.  It's probably the funniest comic ever.  Yeah.  You can read it, and then you just don't understand it.  We don't even have Dilbert in our papers after all that.  What do we got?  What a waste of a page of newsprint.  The comics.  This gets you angry.  Man, look at Jimmy.  He's reading the funny papers.  Funny papers.  Fucking Don Corleone, you dummy. 
[02:16:00]  He's being sprayed with DDT by his little fucking grandson.  Here's the Beetle Bailey.  Sonny should have whacked him.  Oh, we got a little Beetle Bailey today.  This is only a two-paneler, unfortunately.  Two panels?  Oh, boy.  What is that?  One of the guys is sitting there.  The two guys, the old general.  I hope this ends like the first part of Full Metal Jacket.  Beetle Bailey sitting on the toilet.  His brain splattered on the wall.  And there's another guy talking to the old guy.  And he goes, 
[02:16:30]  Ever thinking about retiring, Amos?  And Amos goes,  Yeah, I guess when this job stops being fun, I'll leave.  And the two secretaries overhears.  And the one is like incredulous.  And she's like looking over her shoulder.  And she goes,  Fun!  And the other secretary goes,  When you quit, he quits.  So I guess what happens is the older general probably likes the young secretary.  And it won't be fun once she quits. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Well, that's a thinking man's comic.  Sam enjoys it.  Holy shit.  What is this, the new Dilbert?  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Hand me that one.  What took you so long?  Dilbert got fired January 21st.  Sam sucks.  This is old boring news.  This is not old boring news because we're still following the case.  Uh-huh.  We haven't covered it yet, so now it's news.  This fucking Dilbert.  What is Dilbert?  Looks like a cigar person.  Why is he naked?  Doesn't Dilbert usually have a tie that like kind of goes up at the bottom? 
[02:17:30]  He's not working anymore anymore.  Oh.  Why would you wear a tie if you weren't working?  Is he being interviewed by a dog?  That's Dogbert.  Yeah, that's Dogbert.  I don't know what the fuck Dogbert is.  Is it Dogbert?  Yeah, it's Dilbert and Dogbert.  Oh.  And Dogbert likes peanut butter rubbed on genitals.  Yeah.  On pussy Bert.  On Dilbert's asshole.  And Dogbert puts his pink lipstick burst in Dilbert's mouth burst. 
[02:18:00]  Fucking Dilbert is horrendous.  And just if you want to set up, I'm reading yesterday's Dilbert.  All right, yeah.  So he's interviewing with Dogbert, and Dogbert tells him that they're going to put him through  some rigorous tests for his interview process, and then it turns into kind of like a water  torture situation where Dilbert takes his clothes off, and they've hung him upside down, and  they're dunking his head into water.  Oh, okay.  So now this is the continuation, which explains why Dilbert is without clothes.  Is nude, semi-nude. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Sexy Dilbert.  How do we explain this?  Who wants to take this one?  Well, Dogbert's at the desk, and the cigar person's just standing there.  Apparently, Dogbert is playing the part of the person that Dilbert will have to interview  with when he does go out on the job.  He is now just training, I guess.  Oh, this is fake interviewing?  Fake interviewing with Dogbert.  Oh.  Well, you've got to, you know, be ready to back into it.  Okay, I gotcha.  All right.  Yeah.  So Dogbert says, you survived the rigorous interview process, but there are no openings 
[02:19:00]  in engineering.  Mm-hmm.  Then the next panel.  Panel one.  Mm-hmm.  And panel two.  How lazy is that drawing?  The second panel is of the top part of a building.  Anyone could draw that.  Oh, is that what that was?  That's the only thing I could draw.  I couldn't even tell what that the fuck was.  I thought it was a box.  Yeah, at first I thought they were inside a box, and then I thought it was the air conditioning  top.  It's the top two floors of a building, and that's the whole panel.  And I thought it was, then finally I settled on that it was the other side of a cubicle. 
[02:19:30]  That they were then, like, kind of just looking.  Oh, no.  But no, it's the top of a building.  Very good, Opie.  Oh, wow.  That's an establishing shot.  Very good.  It's a comic strip.  You can't get a little more artistic?  What a lazy fuck.  You're in a lot of newspapers.  Give us more than this, a dumb building.  All he did was duplicate the first and third panel also.  There's no changes.  Yeah.  So he fucking completely lazed out on this one.  Yeah, but it's in the writing.  Shut it.  Yeah, the writing is good, though. 
[02:20:00]  All right, so you've got the top two floors of a building, and I mean, that is it.  And it's a lame-looking building.  It looks like a cubicle, like these guys were saying, or a box.  All right, go ahead.  And, uh...  Dogbert, I guess, says...  Dogbert says...  You don't know, because you don't see the characters, because, you know...  Yeah.  He's lazy.  Why would you?  Yeah.  Dogbert says, however, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  And, uh...  Cigar body says,  You mean a job? 
[02:20:30]  And then I go to panel three.  And that's all they wanted to give us in panel number two.  Because you've got to find out what's in panel three.  Panel three is exactly the same as panel one, but with funnier banter.  It's the exact same drawing, but just different words.  Yeah.  This lazy fuck.  Who was, uh, the Dilbert guy?  I don't know, they said his name on the clip.  Yes.  Yeah, well, I ain't replaying that.  Scott Adams.  Yeah.  Scott Adams sucks.  Even his name is boring.  Fuck him and it's fuck Burt.  So then Dogbert says, uh, no, he doesn't mean a job. 
[02:21:00]  And then Dogbert goes, no, just a position.  Ha.  And then, um...  Cigar body says, this took an ugly turn.  Yeah.  This cannot be.  And that's it.  In papers.  Yeah.  This cannot be in newspapers.  Who?  There's a website dedicated to this.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's it.  Who would laugh at that?  Nobody would laugh at that.  Nobody would laugh at that.  It's not funny.  It's not even this.  It's not even that.  Not even that.  It's just shit. 
[02:21:30]  Well, I want to...  I mean...  That's for jacking off.  Cigar body.  Cigar body.  That's for...  Yes.  Jacking off.  This is Warren Jerome Burt.  But in a way, it does kind of lead you to want to know what's going to happen tomorrow.  Well, if he's standing in front of Dogbert tomorrow, I'm fucking burning the paper.  The whole building.  Burn the paper.  Burn the paper.  Yes, Danny. 
[02:22:00]  On Dilbert.com, there is...  Is there like a preview, a trailer for tomorrow's fucking panel?  Well, no.  But there is a fun game.  It's called Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  And it basically gives you...  It gives you the last panel blank so that you can...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, I think we should have a little contest.  So, if you'd like, I could print out some copies.  I'd like it a lot.  Can we do that?  And we could play a little game.  Let's play a little game.  Sounds fun.  Can the listeners play a line and...  They sure can. 
[02:22:30]  They can go to Dilbert.com.  And there's a link right on the homepage to Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  How about you pass out a bunch of them to our studio audience also?  Oh, yes.  Let's play Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  Let's see if they're funnier than Scott Adams.  Oh, Scott Peterson is funnier than Scott Adams.  Yes, it certainly is.  So is Connor.  You go to Dilbert.com.  Lacey Burt wasn't that.  Lacey Burt. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, God.  She came up like sushi.  All wrapped in seaweed.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, I'll have the young child.  Oh, God.  Oh, God damn.  Oh.  Oh, that's very funny.  Little wasabi head.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  What kind of a job do you guys think I'll end up being able to get?  Oh.  Sam, let's see.  You can only imagine, Sam.  Funny bone remover?  All right, so we're going to play Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert,  the writer, the blogger, who blogs about it.  Of course he does.  Bloggers are always very funny.  They're very funny people.  I can't wait to see what happens.  How long has Dilbert been around?  Forever.  Yeah, it seems like forever. 
[02:24:00]  It certainly does.  It's one of the newer cartoons, but it's got to be around since the early 90s.  Yeah, definitely, and it was actually, it got to the point where I think Dilbert actually  had a short-lived animated series.  Oh.  Yeah.  Where?  I don't remember the original network, but I think Comedy Central syndicated it for a  little while.  UPN.  I was trying to knock that off.  You did pretty good.  I know, close.  Danny, what's this clip?  Some repo clip that's supposed to be pretty good.  Calling a bank.  What do we got here? 
[02:24:30]  As we make copies of the Dilbert panel.  Well, the audience now has it, and they're going to attempt to be funnier than Douchebag  Adams, or whatever his name is.  Adam Shithead.  Scott Adams.  We Not Rich?  What is this about?  I wonder.  We Not Rich.  Yeah, it's something quick.  It's something for Ant, really.  Thank you.  You really just have to play it, I think.  I mean, you'll listen to this voicemail that was left for a banker. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Somebody had left, somebody had called to try and repossess a vehicle for lack of payment.  Yeah, that'll happen.  It will.  And this was the message that was left back to the bank.  And it kind of goes on for a while, and you go, okay.  And then there's a nice little punch at the end that makes sense for everybody.  Randy?  Oh, yes.  Y'all come to get the card.  The card is not here.  The card is in the shop, and one card is at another shop.  If y'all want it that bad, y'all can go pay that man to get it out, and then pay the person to get the other part out. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, because y'all act like y'all couldn't be patient.  You knew that we was going to get it taken care of.  So if y'all want it that bad, y'all can go get it.  You pay the man and pay the other man, and we can leave it as that.  Because we're not owing that much on the card.  Y'all want to trip on it now that we only got owing a thousand or two thousand on it.  So you know what?  God bless y'all.  Y'all can go pick up the card.  So you know what?  Give me a call back, and I will give you the direction to where the man is.  And I will let him know that y'all are going to be paying him to get it out, because y'all don't be patient. 
[02:26:00]  We're not rich like y'all.  That's one thing y'all are going to have to understand.  But one day this year, we will be, because we have Barack Obama.  You cunt.  You fucking cunt.  Ugh.  See, I just felt bad for her.  Shut it.  I did.  She took her car.  First of all, this dumb fucking goon doesn't even understand.  The repo guy can go to the fucking garage, or wherever the fuck this car is that she says is being serviced, 
[02:26:30]  in two different places.  What, did she cut it in half?  And take it.  And repo the fucking thing.  And the bill is still going to your stupid ass.  What a dummy.  Obama president, nah.  I'm not rich like y'all, but I will be.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  Barack gonna take Gant's money?  Yeah, well, she got a car taken away.  You heard.  She's gonna be rich. 
[02:27:00]  Ugh.  Like all of us.  And my fucking taxes go up, because this cunt has to fucking get more money.  Because I gotta help.  Because I gotta help bring people up behind me.  We're moving on.  This is the shit I'm talking about, by the way.  We're moving on right along.  When people call me delusional and stupid and ignorant and fucking, I only get my shit  from movies and stuff.  No.  That's reality.  That's fucking reality.  That's what we're dealing with. 
[02:27:30]  That's what we're fucking dealing with.  Ignorant motherfuckers like that who think they're gonna fucking get rich off of people  that are working for a living.  There's a few out there.  Good, get your car repoed, you cunt.  There's just a few out there.  It's not an epidemic or anything.  Leave a few of your kids in there, too, while you're at it.  So I don't have to pay for them.  Oh, what a twat.  God, is that annoying.  Oh, that clip is annoying.  Fucker.  Oh, good.  That's gonna make this Dilbert fucking panel real easy. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  We got the Dilbert thing.  At least there's one word I know how to spell by heart.  Now, the comic strip we just did for you, you could, like, do the third panel.  Yourself, that's where we're at.  So we got the, you survived the rigorous interview process, but there are no openings in engineering.  Second panel with the building.  However, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Cigar body says you mean a job.  And now we got the third panel.  As we play, are you funnier than Scott Adams, the creator and writer and blogger of Dilbert. 
[02:28:30]  And you can play along at home at, what, Dilbert.com?  All right.  No, first entry.  First entry is from Otto's friend.  Otto, you didn't introduce your friend.  Oh, that's Roger Sullivan over there.  Roger Sullivan.  Yeah.  From Hohocus.  Hohocus?  Yeah.  Where the hell's Hohocus?  It's north of Paramus.  I didn't know of a town called Hohocus. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Well, Danny, you want to read this?  You take the entries.  Sure.  Are you funnier than Scott Adams?  Scott Adams.  So, should I recap the whole panel again?  I did, but yeah, do it one more time.  What the hell?  So, the first panel, Dogbert says to Dilbert, you survived the rigorous interview process,  but there are no openings in engineering.  However, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Dilbert replies, you mean a job. 
[02:29:30]  And in this, our first entry, in the Dilbert game here, Dogbert says no, and Dilbert says,  well, I guess I could deal pot.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, what is he saying over there?  What?  You're hoping for a little something?  More than that?  Oh, wow.  Why would the mic be on?  Why?  Why would it be on?  I'm so glad the listeners get to see it for themselves, because a lot of people think  it's just a bit we do.  Well, no, it's no bit. 
[02:30:00]  It's reality.  All right, we'll try again.  Can we turn these in?  Yeah.  I just thought it would be funny if Dilbert hit hard times and became like a total degenerate,  you know?  That would be funny.  There you go.  I don't know about that.  That's just, that's encouraging.  All right.  Anyone else have entries out there on the bleachers?  Jimmy's handing in his.  Anthony handed in his.  Mine can't be red on the air.  Oh, no?  No, mine can't be red on the air.  Maybe with the button. 
[02:30:30]  Maybe with the button?  Maybe with the button.  Sam, you got an entry from the listeners?  Yeah.  All right.  What is his third panel?  This young man's panel says, sort of, you'll be head bull prepper.  And then Dilbert says, in that case, I'll go back to Ted's filament factory.  Wow.  Hey, all right.  Nice.  Okay.  Here's one. 
[02:31:00]  Let me read this.  This is just from somebody, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  However, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Yeah.  And then Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And Dilbert says, no, Obama president.  Nah.  We're giving your job to a...  Jesus.  Okay.  Wow. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  He got it.  He got it.  He's cracking up.  I just kind of lost it out here.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, look at everybody out there, just really thinking, and what's the matter?  You got nothing, don't you?  Look at you.  Nothing.  Here he goes.  Danny, I'll try that one. 
[02:32:00]  Okay.  Oh, that's never good.  Okay.  All right.  So, however, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales, and Dilbert says, you mean  a job, and Dogbert says, yes, you can do Opie and Anthony's job once I uncatch them  fired.  Oh, boy. 
[02:32:30]  Any others?  We have one from Intern Paul.  Intern Paul?  All right, Sam, take it away.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Anyway, however, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales, and then Dilbert says,  you mean a job, and then in the third box, Paul just wrote the word no.  Why is that funny?  It says something funny about it.  You know what?  Because I was still laughing.  Like, it's just, it's a shitty, it's a shitty setup for a joke, because, like, if Dogbert's 
[02:33:00]  going to offer him a position in sales, why would Dilbert reply, you mean it, like, yes,  a job.  Yes.  Yes, idiot.  That's my entry.  Dogbert says, yes, a position in sales.  Dilbert says, thanks.  It's just as good as what this asshole is writing.  Exactly.  And getting in papers.  You got another one there, Sam?  Yeah, this is from Tom out here.  All right, one of the listeners.  Who, uh, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales, and then Dilbert says, you mean a  job, and then Dogbert doesn't say anything, and then Dilbert says, sales, what other kind 
[02:33:30]  of jobs we got?  I guess in reference to the...  Yeah, the beer club shit.  Right.  Right.  Right.  What is that?  What is that?  That's someone's fucking phone, a UFO.  That's our copy machine making more Dilbert.  Oh, Dilbert's saying, wow.  Well, can the intern that's holding that wireless mic point it away from the copy machine?  Probably put it right down on the copy machine. 
[02:34:00]  Jesus.  It's wrong.  Okay, we have another one.  Yeah.  From, uh, Kevin.  He says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, yeah, Sally, I hate your guts by Jim Norton.  Oh!  I think it's more of a plug than anything.  And then, uh, one from Heather.  Uh, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, based on your choice of clothing, you've already lost all sense  of self-respect.  I think sales is perfect.  Now blow me. 
[02:34:30]  Which is more, uh...  The now blow me kicker I like.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Chokers.  We got another one being handed in.  Thank God.  We got another one.  Um, you mean a job?  No.  You are going on welfare and taking ants' money.  Oh, that's...  See, I don't like that.  I don't find it funny.  Do you have those blank ones?  Yeah, they're coming.  Oh, we got more blank ones being passed out.  Good. 
[02:35:00]  Mm.  Mm-hmm.  Give me a couple.  Give me a couple.  Hey, keep in mind, folks.  This is only today.  We could do yesterday's.  We could do last day's.  Fantastic.  Let's just focus on this one.  Are you sure?  Oh, thank you.  Let's just focus on this one.  Yeah.  Can't wait to read what the listeners come up with online.  Look at this.  Half of my panel will be very happy.  I think I'll make it.  All right.  Intern Paul wasn't happy with his first entry.  Ah.  That's another entry.  Okay.  He says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, only if you fuck me. 
[02:35:30]  And then Gilbert says, I'll get the oven mitts.  Because he's a dog.  That's good.  And the oven mitts.  But, yes, but that would be the dog fucking Dilbert.  No.  Dilbert fucks the dog.  Yeah, but no, the oven mitts are for the dog fucking Dilbert in the ass.  Because the oven mitts keep the claws from digging into Dilbert's sides.  No, no.  The dog wants to get fucked.  But then the oven mitts don't make sense. 
[02:36:00]  No, you don't understand.  No, I understand.  You don't seem to.  Dilbert is fucking the dog.  So what are the oven mitts for?  To fuck the dog with?  No.  Everyone knows the dog fucks the human.  You duct tape the oven mitts on the dog's front paws.  Right.  Because when he mounts you to fuck you, his dewclaw will dig into your sides and leave  scratches on your ribs.  A really good one.  From executive intern David.  Oh, all right. 
[02:36:30]  Let David read it himself.  David's got to do it in his inimitable delivery.  David's got to do it in executive intern David making his way into the studio.  Have you met this guy yet, Otto?  Yeah, at the other building.  Oh, that's right.  He was drinking the...  Okay.  Yeah.  Intern David.  Executive intern David.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Okay, this is...  I'll read it.  Dogbert says, you survived the rigorous interview process.  Oh, yes.  I love the whole panel.  And he says, however, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales. 
[02:37:00]  And Dogbert says, you mean a job?  And Dogbert says, yes, you will actually have to do work.  And Dilbert says, oh, man.  That's like work.  You could write for Dilbert, though.  Yes.  Because that would...  That would probably appear in the paper.  That's a good one.  Oh.  Thank you.  Fool.  Here you go.  Fool.  Oh, thanks, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul is hanging on it.  Uncle Paul making an appearance.  Yes.  Read Uncle Paul's name, Danny. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, no.  Well, I don't really think that it's Dogbert and Dilbert having a conversation.  It just kind of seems like a question that Uncle Paul is kind of wondering.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Thank you, Ken.  Cartoons is fun.  It just says...  You have to read the cartoon. 
[02:38:00]  Okay, let me read the cartoon.  So we know what the first panel is.  And then Dogbert says, however, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales.  And Dilbert asks, you mean a job?  And I'm not quite sure who's saying this.  It's just kind of in the panel.  In bad handwriting, it just says, you got any kids I can fuck?  Jesus.  And Ken is spelled K-A-N.  K-A-N. 
[02:38:30]  I like cartoons.  Oh, an uncle is also spelled with a K.  A cause for kids.  Sam.  We got a couple more.  Yeah.  Heather has a follow-up.  You may remember Heather.  She's the one who wrote, based on your choice of clothing, you've lost all self-respect.  Yeah.  I think sales is perfect.  Yeah.  Now blow me. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  She's trying to get.  The follow-up.  Okay.  He says, you mean a job?  And then the dog says, I said blow me.  It's kind of a follow-up.  Yeah.  It's kind of a sequel, almost.  Dilbert 1.5.  We've got one from Kevin, who Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, more like begging.  You're selling Voss tickets. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, see, and Rich isn't even here to defend himself.  Wow.  That's so not right.  You got another one there, Sam?  Yes.  This is a good one because it's political.  Oh.  Okay.  Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, yeah, a job.  Wait.  Bloomberg just cut that one, too.  Here you go.  Hmm.  I get it.  Because that's the way he's running the city.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:40:00]  We have another entry.  Yes.  So, again, Dogbert, however, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Dilbert asks, you mean a job?  And Dogbert replies, yes, you can clean cum out of my handlebar mustache.  Jesus.  Wow.  That was a nice little callback.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Sam, back to you.  We've got one from Keith. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And then Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, yes, but you'll be selling Gap the movie.  And then Dilbert says, I would rather drive my wife to suicide.  Oh.  Wow.  That kind of happened.  A little Paulo bashing going on there.  Jesus.  And then our intern, Charlie, did one.  All right.  And then Dogbert says, I mean, Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, no, a position in sales, you cunt. 
[02:41:00]  So, that's the blow me approach.  Yeah, yeah.  Just something dirty.  It'll always make you chuckle.  Yeah.  Are we about done there?  Sam?  I think we have Heather going for a third home line.  God bless her.  She should just apply for the fucking job.  Heather, what's the plug again?  Why not?  I got one.  You got what?  George Gallo and Terry McNeely at Ollie's Point on Sunday, February 8th. 
[02:41:30]  What are they?  The comedians?  The comedians, yeah.  The comedians, yeah.  Good.  Very good.  I knew you'd have a plug.  Hmm.  Okay.  This is Heather's third entry.  Yep.  This is a good one.  Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, stop staring at me.  Wow.  Because he's just looking at them.  You know.  I'm getting a report that they won't allow curses online.  They effing bleeped them out on you.  So, you got to work around that. 
[02:42:00]  If you're trying to do this online at Dilbert.com.  Intern Scott has one, which I don't know why he's taking shots at people in this one,  but Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And Dogbert says, yes.  Now go sell Opie a new fucking car.  Oh.  Oh.  They're tying it into the show.  Yeah.  Now.  I'm working on that car thing.  Hope that's okay with you, Scott.  He's working on it. 
[02:42:30]  You don't have to answer them.  All right.  And the fart ends the segment, I do believe.  Yeah.  There's no one.  Exclamation point.  Let me just take an Eatsy break.  An Eatsy break.  I got an Eatsy.  An Eatsy break.  Otto from Otto and George in studio playing the Treehouse Comedy Club, Stanford, Connecticut  on Saturday.  Saturday, yes, sir.  And then the brokerage out there on Long Island on February 18th.  Mm-hmm.  More with Otto from Otto and George in just a bit.  Bum-ba-dum. 
[02:43:00]  Let's get something about Bill Hicks.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to hear that.  Oh, you want to hear the Bill Hicks stuff?  Yes.  Oh, that would be nice.  Oh, that would be nice.  Let's meet up.  Definitely.  Otto, you're a fan of Bill Hicks, right?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  One of your guys knows Bill Hicks.  Yeah.  A lot of people know Bill Hicks.  I never got to see him live.  He's one of my favorites of all time.  I got to meet him.  At, um, that's huge.  Governors.  Down in Levittown.  Adam Ferraro was opening up for him.  Right.  And went back in the dressing room, and there was Adam and Bill Hicks. 
[02:43:30]  That's cool.  Took his hand.  Felt privileged, because I was a big fan at the time.  You were?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  More people are becoming fans after his death.  Yeah.  It's so weird.  When you listen to his stuff, a lot of it can be said today.  It's kind of timeless.  Some of the references are a little off, but besides that, the material's right there.  If you just put in different names of things, yeah, you could use the material now.  Well, he beat the shit out of Bush, so, you know.  Yeah.  You play that stuff, it sounds like he's talking about the, well, I was going to say the current 
[02:44:00]  president, the president that we just, uh, said goodbye to.  I'd love to have heard his take on our current president.  I'm sure he would have liked him.  Yeah.  But, uh, I'm sure he would have been very funny.  Um, you should go to Bill, uh, you should go to YouTube, uh, Letterman.  I thought this would get a lot more attention than it did.  What's the YouTube?  The, the internets.  What is the YouTubes?  The YouTubes.  Because I hear a lot about it.  Um, what happened was, on Friday, Letterman had Bill Hicks' mom on to discuss the banning 
[02:44:30]  of a set that Bill Hicks did back in 1993.  Bill Hicks came out, did a killer set, but Letterman, uh, decided not to air it, and it  became this thing for many, many years.  Uh, and, uh, Letterman finally made good with Bill Hicks' mom, sat her down, they discussed  the controversy, and how, and how it hurt Bill Hicks personally, and hurt, uh, Bill Hicks'  family, and they, they got into it.  It was really good TV.  And then, uh, and then David said, what, you know, we're playing it today, unedited, and 
[02:45:00]  they played the set from 1993.  This was on Friday.  I thought it would get a little more attention than it did, but it kind of, like, skated by  a lot of people.  Well, Friday's a weird time to do it.  I know, I know, he kind of buried it, but it's on YouTube if you want to check out the  whole thing.  And, uh, Letterman even admitted that he didn't see the set, you know, since it was done back  in 93.  It just sat on the shelves.  So, I don't know why, out of nowhere, he decided to come, you know, to do this.  That is odd.  I don't have the backstory on this, but he just... 
[02:45:30]  Did he have a nursery of Hicks' death, or his birthday, or anything?  I don't know.  Because that was a 1230 show that he was cut from, what, you know, now it's 1130.  93, right?  Yeah.  Right?  So, he's...  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  It's even more stringent at that hour.  That is weird, like, uh, that he did this.  Maybe he's, like, doing something where he's kind of getting a lot of things off his chest  or something.  Yeah, who knows?  He's doing that whole apologize thing, and then...  Yeah, if someone has more info on that, maybe you can give the show a call.  But I got actually something that adds to this.  So, Bill Hicks goes on Letterman 93, did Letterman dozens, at least a dozen times. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know how many times total.  Well, and, uh, this set was banned, and then Bill Hicks went back to Texas, Austin, and  he, uh, talked about the whole banning of the Letterman thing on a public access show,  and we got that audio today.  Public access?  And this is audio that Letterman obviously didn't play, so we're just adding to the whole...  Ooh, look at us.  ...the whole story thing.  Hmm.  So, I mean, the quality's shitty, because it's public access, but I think we'll be all right  with this.  So, Bill Hicks explains the appearance on the Letterman show and being censored after 
[02:46:30]  the taping.  Recently, on the David Letterman show on October 9th, that I did the show, taped the show at  5.30 in New York, and when it's 7 p.m., was called by the producer and told that I would  be excised completely from the show.  I, of course, asked why.  The material had been approved and re-approved by the producers, and they said that CBS had  deemed the material, these are quotation marks, unsuitable for the viewing public and for 
[02:47:00]  the Letterman audience.  And I made the point that when I'm not on the show, I'm a member of the Letterman audience,  and so ultimately, what you're saying is, my material is not suitable for me.  What a predicament.  Okay, smart-ass.  Oh, he was great, though, man.  How come he's gone, but Swayze lives on? 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Might have been a little rough.  Well, if I have to see one more commercial for the Beast, shut up, all right?  It looks like shit.  The good ones die young.  Enough already.  Billy Joel said it perfectly.  Yeah, look how old he is.  Exactly.  Then he hit a tree.  It's always the good ones that pass way too soon.  Always.  Swayze's very intense.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you watch the Beast.  Trying to look all intense on that show.  I know.  He looks now exactly like his brother, who used to look like retarded Patrick Swayze. 
[02:48:00]  Now Patrick Swayze looks like retarded Patrick Swayze.  Like Patrick Swayze's brother would show up on, like, some fucking...  He'd be playing an extra in a gang, you know?  And he'd be in the background, and you're like, fucking Patrick Swayze or something?  Yeah.  And then you'd get a look at him and go, whoa, that looks like a retarded Patrick Swayze.  And then at the end, you'd see, you know, Aaron Swayze or whatever the fuck his name is.  I have no idea what his name is.  Tom Hanks has...  Something Swayze.  Tom Hanks has a brother that's just been a zero. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, really?  Has Tom Hanks has been this huge...  Isn't it like his twin brother or something?  I don't know.  He looks very similar.  Find Tom Hanks' brother online.  I saw him on a soap opera once.  Yeah, and he tried to follow in his footsteps and not even close.  Wow.  Not even close.  It's probably easy to follow in the footsteps at the beginning when he's like on Bosom Buddies,  but then after you're winning Oscars and stuff.  Yeah.  He's a glorified extra.  They give him a line or two just to make him feel better.  Remember that guy?  Eric Douglas?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Eric, yeah.  His father is a gigantic movie icon, and his brother is a huge producer. 
[02:49:00]  It's sad what happened to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right, as we find Tom Hanks' brother's picture, here's Bill Hicks.  This is what a lot of people have been asking today.  He explains the actual joke that prompted the removal of his set,  and then talks about the promo that aired on that night's Late Show.  What happened was I did some material about the pro-white people.  Oh, it was abortion.  That abortion issue, that'll get you.  Because there was some violence in his set.  There was some other religious stuff, 
[02:49:30]  and then there was the abortion material.  And the joke I did was very simple.  All I said was, if you're so pro-life, do me a favor.  Don't walk arms and block medical clinics.  Walk arms and block cemeteries.  Let's see how committed you are to this premise.  It couldn't even be construed as pro-pro-life if you wanted to make that argument.  Yeah.  Anyway, they counted that as one of the, quote-unquote, hot points that I touched on.  Here's the punchline. 
[02:50:00]  Monday night during the Letterman show, a commercial airs for pro-life.  So, see, we just had a misunderstanding.  I thought I lived in the U.S. of A, United States of America.  Right.  And actually, we live in the U.S. of A, United States of Advertising.  Freedom of expression is guaranteed if you've got the money.  Mm.  Okay.  Yeah.  It could be true today, man.  It could be true today.  Oof.  Explains the Jesus joke that was also flagged as inappropriate. 
[02:50:30]  And other hot points I hit on on the set, which was, again, approved and re-approved by the Letterman segment producer.  Until, of course, it was time to do it.  Until after I did it.  Until after it was done.  Yeah.  And the other material I touched on was Jesus, which they don't want any discussion, which I find so funny.  I mean, it doesn't matter what angle you take on it.  The fact that a comedian is talking about Jesus, people might construe it as sacrilegious.  And, in fact, it wasn't.  What I said, all I said was, a lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks. 
[02:51:00]  You think when Jesus comes back, he's going to want to see a cross.  It's just an observation.  It's a great observation.  Why would you do that if you're hoping he comes back?  Yeah.  Hey, check this out, Jesus.  Remember this?  Right.  I don't go for that type of humor.  No.  You don't?  It's not necessary, no.  Why?  Christian Jimmy.  He's funny.  I just don't feel that that's not that fast with the music.  I love it. 
[02:51:30]  It's either too fast or too slow.  Christ.  I didn't even think you're Christian Jimmy.  That's how tired I am.  Oh, really?  I thought you were going to go into Christian Jimmy.  No, I wasn't.  Oh, okay.  Well, fuck it.  All right.  Bill talks about freedom of expression, how the major media corporations want to keep the viewing public stupid.  The point I'm making is about the idea of freedom of expression.  And I believe that there's this agenda in mainstream media, and I think it's fairly easy to back this up, 
[02:52:00]  to keep people stupid, docile, and apathetic.  And therefore, the elite who own these corporations and the families that own the corporations, even fewer people, their agendas to keep us stupid and apathetic.  That's why I love public access.  Wow.  A little distracted, because Patrick in Boston, we just did a live read for Porn.com.  He writes, I'm in a hotel in Connecticut trying to get work done.  I heard the Porn.com ad by Danny and immediately checked out the site. 
[02:52:30]  It took 30 seconds to jerk off into one of the hotel hand towels.  I normally use the washcloth, but I didn't have a clean one left.  I have to read that for the advertiser.  Your advertising is working here on the O.P. Anthony show.  30 seconds.  Wow, man.  He was fighting a good fight back in 93.  Why are we bothering?  Because in 16 years, it's the same shit we're dealing with, or comedians in general are dealing with, and radio show hosts are dealing with. 
[02:53:00]  Dave likes him, but apparently had a rule about Jesus jokes.  Dave likes me, but what I found out subsequently to all this, and by the way, I don't mean to keep pushing my own little horn here, tooting my horn,  but on Monday, this Monday, in the New Yorker magazine, there's a profile about me, including this story about Letterman.  And I found out that it's one of Dave's rules that he doesn't like comics to talk about Jesus on the show, which I find really weird. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, they pretend to do this hip, late-night talk show, when in actuality, though, it's mainstream as anything.  And, again, it doesn't matter what angle you take on the Jesus subject.  That's what bugs me.  Just because I'm a comic doesn't mean I'm treating it with disrespect.  Wow.  Yeah.  Another brilliant point.  Jesus.  And then, finally, the last clip of his interview with Public Access Channel.  See, what they do is they kowtow to a minority that's very vocal. 
[02:54:00]  Reasonable people don't write letters.  Reasonable people have lies.  Reasonable people know it's just a joke.  Reasonable people know it's just TV.  They know they can change the channel or they'll wait and something else will come on.  Sure.  See, reason why people don't get it accurate is these minorities, these fundamentalists, who are totally organized, and they're all a minority,  and who are the ones trying to set this agenda for America.  And they come to find out that, you know, I guess $14 million was his price. 
[02:54:30]  You know what I mean?  Everyone has a price, they say.  Oh, man.  Luckily, I don't have any money, so it doesn't matter what I have.  Well, I'm glad that problem got solved over the years, and we don't have to deal with any of that anymore.  It's so funny to hear such an archaic way of dealing with things on that recording and realize just a few short years later we're so far away from that.  So good to know that the corporations told those people to go fuck themselves.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  And they don't kowtow to these small groups of people because normal working people that enjoy entertainment like that don't write letters.  Right.  But we finally found that out.  We sure did, Anthony.  And that was just after the flying car came out.  Yeah.  Which was just a boon to mankind.  Oh, we're still in this shit.  We're still in it.  This is, what, 16 years ago.  And we're still fighting that horse shit. 
[02:55:30]  And you try to tell these corporate guys, why are you listening to it?  It's five people with letterhead.  Why are you firing really good radio shows over, yeah, a group of ten people that then try to get some of their other people to write letters that never even heard the broadcast?  They never heard the broadcast.  Why are you doing this?  Because they're cowards.  You're taking away programs that a lot of people enjoy, way more people enjoy than hate.  They're cowards, that's why.  Because they don't fucking write.  But you would think in 16 years the point is that they would try to move forward and understand what this is all about. 
[02:56:00]  Realize that nothing is going to come of those people complaining if you just ignore them.  Nothing will come of it.  Right.  Your business won't go down the shitter.  You're not going to lose advertisers for any length of time.  Yeah.  It's not going to make an impact on your company.  But we know the answer.  It's because they're cowards.  It's that simple.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, unfortunately, that's the simple question.  16 years later, they continue to be cowards.  They'd rather do the phony apology, which they don't mean.  You think some corporate spokesman gives a flying fuck when they make those statements to these interest groups? 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  We sincerely apologize.  And if anybody was offended, you think this guy is sitting there at home going,  God, I'm so upset with what that show did.  I'm going to write this apology letter.  They don't care.  It's just another fucking thing to put in the outbox.  I got a challenge.  Yes, Charles.  Give me the last apology that was sincere and real.  Bill Clinton's apology was bullshit. 
[02:57:00]  All the apologies we've made over the years, bullshit.  Yeah.  And we've said before, if we ever are heard apologizing or even sounding like we're apologizing,  we don't mean it.  So we have to say that beforehand because when we're doing it,  we have to kind of sound like we mean it just to keep our jobs.  You hear Anthony crumpling up the paper in disgust after the last apology.  But the apologies are never sincere.  Name one.  What was the last apology?  John Candy and Uncle Buck. 
[02:57:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Just awkward in his own scare.  Sorry.  How great was John Candy?  The last apology that was sincere.  That's a good question.  Like when Clinton went through that whole thing, please.  He didn't mean any of that.  Somebody will come up with one maybe.  Let's see.  No one in the audience has one.  Hey, you want to hear Letterman now talking to Bill X's mom?  Yes, very much. 
[02:58:00]  Karen Hill to Henry Hill after she pulled a gun on her.  Kind of sincere.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That was sincere.  Of course, you're living in movie land again, Ant.  And there's this one.  This one is very sincere.  I'm sorry.  I did so many bad things.  I tell, so I'm very sorry.  That's fucking bad Lieutenant Sogan.  I tried to do the right thing, but I'm weak. 
[02:58:30]  I'm too fucking weak.  That's great.  Where are we with Bill Hicks' mom?  Did we cut that up today?  Because it's a long segment of his mom.  Yeah, it really is long.  And it goes on, and it's kind of rough to listen to.  Yeah.  I mean, from what I had heard, you had wanted the set, which I do have for you in tracks.  But you said the mom stuff was kind of whatever, so I didn't go for it.  After we discussed it, I want to play some clips from Bill Hicks' mom. 
[02:59:00]  And then after that, you know what?  I think the material should just sit there by itself without us commenting, so I want  to just play the set.  I think that's the way to do it today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's broken down into tracks, but I think in this case, let it roll.  I think people will enjoy the set.  Absolutely.  16 years later.  Sincere apology.  God damn it.  It's got me thinking.  I can't think of one.  Imus' apology?  Are you insane?  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[02:59:30]  Then he hires a Benetton ad to keep him on the air.  Yeah.  Please.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm trying to think now.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  You think that was sincere?  I'm sorry.  Let's think about this for a second.  You're thinking?  No, I think he was annoyed.  You're thinking he was doing what he needed to do to try to save his job?  Yes.  Because that's where all apologies come from.  Yes.  He might have felt slightly bad.  Like, you know, maybe that was fucked up.  But no, I don't believe that was.  They're self-serving apologies.  I agree.  You only do them to.  You wouldn't give an apology out unless it was something in it for you. 
[03:00:00]  Yes.  Yes.  We're stalling because we're trying to get Bill Hicks' mom's audio there.  So let's go to calling my thrilling commentary.  Stalling?  Jesus.  Thank you, Kenny, for my treat.  You think I was babbling?  Rob in Tennessee.  Rob.  Hold on.  Sorry to interrupt you.  Put my treat there!  Hey, buddy.  How's your turn?  Now that's a treat.  Hey, Rob.  Thanks, Kenny.  Hey, I was just going to say what you thought about Dogs of Bounty Hunters' apology there.  No.  It was really sincere.  Oh, my God.  It's a save-your-job apology.  Tim C. in Ohio might have the only sincere apology that we all know. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah?  Pick that up.  I'm trying to think how I can tease this.  Let's see.  Sincere apology.  You've got to think way out of the box.  Someone's genuinely sorry about that.  That's the hint.  The Germans apologized for World War II and what they did.  You've got to think way out of the box.  John Lennon with the Jesus bit. 
[03:01:00]  He was fucking trying to sell records.  Stay in the country and sell records.  Jerry Lee Lewis apologized to Geranimals.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Elliot Spitzer's apology?  Stop.  No.  He was trying to save his job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another one that was trying to save his job.  And that's key to my hint.  This guy wasn't trying to save his job.  Think way out of the box.  Out of the box?  Ralph crammed into Trixie? 
[03:01:30]  That's true.  He was apologizing for fucking that black girl down the street.  Outside the pool hall?  He ate her ass in an alley.  While Norton looked out for him.  I do remember that one.  And then Teddy Obman came in and fingered Ed's ass for a little while.  While fucking crammed into black chick's ass.  It was awful.  It was so loud that Garrity was yelling from upstairs.  Tell Teddy Obman to quit smelling his fingers, Cramden. 
[03:02:00]  Fucking Officer Grogan came over.  Let's go to Patton, Connecticut.  Mrs. Manacani fucked herself with a zucchini.  All she watched.  Carlos was fucking all the girls around the apartment building.  It's true.  Alice had unclipped dick cheese on her upper lip.  And Ralph knew what she was doing.  It's not dick cheese, Ralph.  It's fetter.  Fetter.  Fetter. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, Pat, go ahead.  You had a last sincere story I heard was when Anthony said he was sorry he ever got married.  That's funny.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a different type of apology.  That's me apologizing to myself.  Yeah, Brian.  Brian!  Oh!  Hey there, Brian.  Brian here.  You're on the air.  Good evening.  Let me finally go to the phone.  Going through puddles.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yes, Brian!  Yes!  Hey, this is Brian. 
[03:03:00]  Hi, Brian.  Really?  We've just been saying, Brian, you're on the air for fucking like a minute.  Hi, Brian.  I'm on the road.  I can't hear you.  I was going to say,  Waddle-doo-doo, apologize.  Thank God that got through.  Thank God.  We almost missed that humor.  Kyle in Alabama.  I need a baby lady.  Alabama meow.  What's up, Kyle?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hey, what about a few years ago, the Beastie Boys apologized for their lyrics, and no one 
[03:03:30]  was really pressuring them into it.  They just sort of came out of nowhere and said it.  I don't have knowledge on that, my friend.  I know in a sincere apology.  Yeah.  When Alex came downstairs.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, I'll accept your apology for fucking having the timing of diarrhea in the night  that I...  Go ahead.  Fucking cunt-faced bag of vomit.  What are you trying to knock down up there?  The Grand Theft Auto 4 glove.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  Don't worry, man.  Let's go to John the Trucker.  Here's the answer to the hint I gave that came from Tim.  Go ahead, John.  Yeah, so that's a sincere apology with Bud Dwyer's.  Our Bud Dwyer.  Wow.  All right.  He wasn't playing.  You know something?  He was genuinely sorry that he was such a douche.  And then he wasn't trying to get his job back, now was he?  No.  Yep.  Eatabullet.com.  Eatabullet.com.  Very good.  So, there you go.  I think that could be the last sincere apology is our Bud Dwyer. 
[03:04:30]  Done by a madman.  My favorite comb-over.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  They're still cutting up Hicks' mom's audio.  So, quick break.  We come back.  Letterman talking to Bill Hicks' mom from Friday's Letterman show.  And then the Bill Hicks set that was banned for many, many years and was just in hiding  and on a shelf getting dusty.  And Letterman finally decided to play it on Friday.  We're going to replay it here today on our show.  All right?  Brock.  Opie and Anthony.  Never a big Black Crows fan, either. 
[03:05:00]  But who the fuck am I?  I'm Anthony.  We're back.  Hope he's taking a little leap.  Wow.  Either a leap or a big shit.  You're limping.  Wow.  That one really hurts.  What's wrong with my Black Crows?  I'm not a Black Crows fan.  I was never a Black Crows fan.  They're kind of old school.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  What didn't you like about them?  Their music.  Everything?  Yeah.  There's not a song I like from Black Crows.  What about Black Moon Rising?  No, I don't.  You got a little Black Moon Rising?  I don't know one song they do.  Well, this is one.  This is one.  I don't recognize it except from this show.  I just don't like it.  They don't have Black Moon Rising and the Master Computer from...  Master Computer.  I don't like them.  That's too bad. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, no, really not.  One must band I have to listen to.  Where were we?  The Bill Hicks mom stuff?  We have it yet?  Bill Hicks.  Let's go.  In what, two minutes?  What should we do for two minutes then?  What can we do for two minutes?  You got to make the stretch sound.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The stretch.  Oops.  Knocking over my Gatorade.  How about the Christian Bale audio?  I haven't heard that.  I didn't hear the Christian Bale audio.  It's good for one more full uncut play because it's so fantastic. 
[03:06:30]  That's more like a minute and a half.  Well, they're making sound machines out of it.  Sound boards, yeah.  Sound boards, I mean.  Where you can then make prank phone calls.  You're going to have all yours tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  For this side of the show?  I have this one.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  I'm stuck.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  I got to tell you what happens on this show.  Like, we hear these clips and it's a race to see who gets it on their machine.  I am so jealous that you have that one.  I might also have this.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, I'm dying.  That is classic for any occasion where an intern fucks up.  Oh, my God.  A caller stinks.  Where is that?  About 20 minutes ago?  Yeah, exactly.  We were off the air during that.  I should have played it.  Oh, you're killing me with this.  Fucking amateur.  Oh, you're killing me.  Oh, I want a whole bank of just Christian Bale yelling at his DP.  See, I got this.  Yeah.  That's me.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  We're moving on.  Oh, da-da-da-da. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  We're moving on.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Yeah, but do you have this one?  I am about to be a lesbian.  A lesbian.  Do you have this one?  A classic?  Oh, my God.  Look.  Space Shell Endeavor.  It doesn't work anymore.  Oh, shit.  Oh, look at that.  Pushing the button and everything.  It don't work.  It's like, hey, how about this one?  Could you fix that?  Very beautiful girls, isn't it?  Where were you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[03:08:00]  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Fucking Kytel.  I got this one, though.  Do the bin.  Do the bin.  That I like.  Oh, and punt doesn't work.  I'll get Eric.  I don't know why it's not.  You can get a doggie style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get the same.  That's a good one.  And is it true you hate just the black in the Black Crows, or?  Oh, no, no.  If they were called the Crows, would you be okay with this band?  Just the Crows is a great band.  Yeah.  That show is fucking bizarre. 
[03:08:30]  Isn't it?  God.  What?  You're just watching us and going, what the fuck's wrong with us?  I feel like when I'm not here for a while, I'm like, you're speaking in pig Latin.  I have no idea what any of these bits are going to mean.  No, you're absolutely right.  What do you need us to explain?  No, not that.  I mean, it's working.  I'm not, you know, what the fuck, you know.  Why?  You're not entertaining me.  Yeah, we're just arguing over who got the best sound effects. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Because I hope he's got a fucking sound effect thing.  I got one.  Yeah.  And now we got it like, the second a good clip comes out, we race to see who can get  it on their machine first.  Yeah.  Because once it's on your machine, then it's, you know, fucking out of the public till.  And we do a bunch of bits at the same time, because you got Steven S. Barbasher, not  surprisingly, and loves Whitesnake.  Ah.  All right.  You don't like Black Sabbath, do you?  I like the Great White.  Black Sabbath.  I'm not really a big fan.  Oh, boy. 
[03:09:30]  I appreciate what they've done, but I'm not a big fan.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Never thought of it in those terms.  What's wrong, Sam?  Oh.  Why are you rolling your fucking eyes?  You know, it's a paradox.  I didn't roll my eyes.  Barry White.  Barry White.  I don't know if I like him or not.  Well.  You like his name.  It's very hard to decide.  All right.  So where were we?  Remember when we were talking about Bill Hicks and the band thing?  Mm-hmm.  So the letterman on Friday brought Bill Hicks' mom in.  So this is part two of our little discussion, I guess. 
[03:10:00]  Here we go.  Thank you very much for being so gracious and so generous to come and visit with us here  so we could take a look at Bill's shot on the program that never got on.  And let me again, if I haven't previously, just apologize for the heartache and sadness  that my decision caused you and your family.  And, of course, made all the worse by the knowledge that, at the time, Bill was terribly, terribly sick.  And not many people knew that, did they?  Very few.  Very few. 
[03:10:30]  And I appreciate you saying that.  Good call, Dave.  Yeah.  Way to go, Dave.  Geez, he was sick and you just fucking shunned him from the show, Dave.  You know what, though, the other side of it, it gave Mr. Hicks a lot of publicity.  Yeah, of course it did.  Good job, Bill.  There was an upside to it.  Here we go.  He always said when he was, up until the time he got interested in comedy,  that he was going to Texas A&M to be a vet.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it.  Hey, that wasn't part of bra. 
[03:11:00]  You know, Dave should have lightened up on the old bra.  What the hell?  I don't remember seeing it that way on Friday.  What?  You need to make sure everything's okay over here.  That's just, that was unnecessary of Mr. Letterman.  Yeah.  Texas A&M to be a vet.  He loved animals, and that's what he wanted to do.  And then he got interested in watching Johnny Carson, 
[03:11:30]  and he read books about Woody Allen.  So he got interested in that.  He said that he saw Johnny Carson on TV.  Go see where he got his comedy chops from.  You mean you can make a living doing that?  Geez, Dave.  He's pumping it up a little bit.  Another fucking Vito Corleone in the fucking tomato patch again. 
[03:12:00]  He's doing a little punching up, that's all.  He does that.  He's spilling it.  How did you feel about coming here tonight?  Was this an easy decision for you to make?  I mean, I was, I thought...  Were you surprised that I accepted?  Well, I...  I'm surprised when anybody comes here.  No, I wasn't surprised, but part of me thought, well, she has every reason not to come here. 
[03:12:30]  That's right.  I had a lot of reasons not to come.  Wow.  And I thought about it, and then I decided to come.  Good.  I'm glad you're here.  Damn.  And again, I know I can't make up for the damage that was caused, but I hope symbolically this means something to you.  Well, it does.  Yes, and I will tell you that that was a very hard time, 15 years ago when that happened, and I just will have to tell you that it was. 
[03:13:00]  Well, I'm well aware of that.  I know.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  I don't know personally how difficult it was, but I can certainly, now that I have a son, I can certainly imagine what that...  You had to have a child to know.  That's right.  Okay, what else?  You want to know?  What's she saying?  Huh?  What'd she say?  What else do you want to know?  Oh.  So.  Asshole!  There you go.  There's some audio of Bill Hicks' mom.  Oh, ta-da, ta-da! 
[03:13:30]  People want that as a ringtone immediately.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great ringtone.  That would be a great ringtone.  I don't know how to download ringtones.  It's easy.  I don't know how to do it.  I get frightened.  This is what you do.  You take your phone, right, and you hand it to Daddy.  It's so effin' easy.  I am frightened.  Just man over the phone.  I don't know what I'm doing.  What do you want as a ringtone?  Da-da-da-da.  Oh, yeah, that one.  Oh, da-da-da-da!  Oh, da-da-da-da!  I get it!  Oh, da-da-da-da!  It's mother!  This one, when a text comes in.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur! 
[03:14:00]  Oh, who'd that be?  I'd be nice on the train.  All right, you guys want to...  This is a giant cock.  Oh, good!  That's the one I'll put for my mom when she calls.  It's mom on the phone.  That's how you know it's mother.  Mother?  That would be a funny one for your mom.  Wouldn't it?  And a picture of a big cock comes up on the fuckin' display.  Mom always liked the big cock.  Yeah, she sure did. 
[03:14:30]  The old size queen, and you give her the old chin punch.  Mom's a size queen.  If it ain't black, it ain't worth it.  Right or wrong, ma?  I want to play the Bill Hicks thing and end the show today.  Do it a bit!  Let's do this.  So this is the set that was banned for 16 years that Letterman finally played on the show on Friday.  I think it's worth playing again today.  Let's get the plugs in because we'll leave the people with this.  Otto and George will be at the Treehouse Comedy Club in Stanford, Connecticut. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, all you Connecticut people come out and see me.  On Saturday?  Trish just told me I wasn't talking enough on the show.  I just ate a turkey sandwich.  I'm slipping into darkness here.  I'm slipping into darkness.  That'll do it.  You should talk more.  That's all right.  I didn't say anything at home.  She's either shut up or she's on the phone.  Otto, you should talk more.  Your grandson, Frank.  You killed today, brother. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  You did very well today.  We do the show every day.  There are times we check out for a long period of time.  Oh, please.  That's how it is.  I feel no need to impress anyone at this point.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's better to push less.  Yeah.  I said it first.  All right.  So Otto's doing that, and then you got the brokerage on the 18th of February.  Yeah.  For everybody on Long Island.  That's where I first met you out on the island.  That's where I met him.  Yeah.  Forty-dollar shoes.  All right.  We'll leave you with the Bill Hicks thing. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  And a plug.  Oh.  Caroline's tomorrow through Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  And my Artie gig.  Well, our gig.  My gig with Tower Gig.  Sure.  February 21st in Tower Theater in Upper Darby.  And you can go to LiveDation.com for those tickets unless you don't want them.  Mm-hmm.  Then don't.  But you'll see, Gene.  I'm going to go to Caroline's.  I'll see you at Caroline's.  You should come this weekend. 
[03:16:30]  I have the whole thing I'm doing now.  What do you do now?  It's where I take people's driver's licenses.  I guess things about them.  But I guess things that are not on the license.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  When did you incorporate that into the act?  Brand new.  Ah.  Like, I'll take your license and I'll do something with it.  Do you put it by your head?  Yes.  Yeah.  Like, if the guy's name is Chip.  Mm-hmm.  I'll say, um, Chip.  And I'll guess something about his life. 
[03:17:00]  And, wow, are you good at it?  Very good so far.  All right.  That sounds like a pile of shit.  I'll do this.  I'll say this.  I'll do something like this.  But I'll sneak a peek at it.  Like, what I'll do is this.  I'll hold the license and as it's coming to my head, I'll peek at it.  And I'll go, uh, Chip.  And they'll be like, fuck.  You were born in 1978.  And it's against your head.  Yes.  So people don't think you could see it, but you saw it while it was coming up to your head. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Amazing.  Now you just told the trick, though.  Yes.  So you can't do it anymore.  And then Ernie Hudson comes out and he fucks Chip's face.  He's behind the curtain.  He paralyzes.  And he comes out of his tumor and he drops a honey jar on Chip's face.  And he fucks it.  He breaks a jar of honey over Chip's head.  Gets his head all sticky.  You know Tuma just had a fucking baby arm. 
[03:18:00]  Tuma had a cock that was as long as it was dirty.  Tuma.  T-T-T-Tuma.  Stupid Tuma.  Oh, Tuma was a dope.  Oh, but what a hog.  Oh, boy.  Big cock.  A lot of dogs and some bees.  You fucking idiot.  Big fat, like, red head on it.  Like a dog dick.  I gotta see that movie again.  Yep. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Yes, Bill Hicks.  Bill Hicks from 1993.  It was banned until this past Friday.  Letterman finally did the right thing.  Here it is.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Very excited to be here tonight.  And I got some great news today.  I finally got my own TV show coming out as a replacement show this fall.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's not a talk show.  Don't worry.  It's a half-hour weekly show that I will host entitled Let's Hunt and Kill Billy Ray Cyrus. 
[03:19:00]  Thank you.  It's fairly self-explanatory.  Each week we let the hounds of hell loose.  We chase that jarhead, no-talent, cracker idiot all over the globe.  Until I finally catch that fruity little ponytail of his, pull him to his knees, put a shotgun in his mouth.  Then we'll be back in 94 with Let's Hunt and Kill Michael Bolton. 
[03:19:30]  Also look out for our Vanilla Ice MC Hammer Marky Mark Christmas Special.  I don't want to give away any surprises, but Marky Mark's the first one we catch and kill on that show  because his pants kept falling around his ankles and he couldn't run away.  I crossbow him right in the ab.  Bring the whole kids and family and everything.  It's a Christmas spectacular.  I don't know what my deal is. 
[03:20:00]  I'm like a 31-year-old curmudgeon.  That's the deal.  You know, I went to a dance club the other day, you know, and dragged against my will, you know.  And this girl asked me to dance, which I thought was hilarious, you know.  Would you like to dance?  You know, I'm like, yeah, you read my mind, you know.  That's why I'm leaning in the darkest corner closest to the exit, you know.  I'm about to boogie.  I'm about to cut a rug.  But it's weird.  Women have this weird myth you can tell the way a guy is in bed by how he is on a dance floor. 
[03:20:30]  I think that's ridiculous.  What does it matter?  You know what I mean?  If a guy is on a dance floor really getting into it, enjoying himself, expressing himself,  what does it matter how he is in bed?  He's gay.  Real men don't dance.  They sit, sweat, and curse.  Speaking of homosexuality, you know, I consider myself fairly open-minded, 
[03:21:00]  but something has come to my attention I find absolutely shocking.  I don't know if you've heard about it.  These new grade school books for children to teach them gay lifestyles.  You know what I'm talking about?  One of them is called Heather's Two Mommies.  The other is called Daddy's New Roommate.  I'm going to have to draw the line here, folks, and say this is absolutely disgusting.  Okay?  It is grotesque and evil. 
[03:21:30]  I'm talking about Daddy's New Roommate.  Heather's Two Mommies is pretty cool.  I don't know if you want to check that out.  They're hugging on page seven.  Oh, go, Mommies, go, go.  Anyway, it makes me miss my youth.  People annoy me.  You know what's really annoying me?  These pro-life people.  You ever look at their faces?  I'm pro-life. 
[03:22:00]  Why don't they look it?  They just exude joie de vie, you know?  You see them trying to go to an orphanage and adopt a kid.  We're pro-life.  We're here to adopt.  But kids are just, oh, don't pick me.  Oh, no.  I'll eat gruel, 15 to a bed, no problem.  Just keep Heather's Two Mommies coming, and we're fine in here.  I'm pro-life.  You know, if you're really pro-life, do me a favor.  Don't lock arms and block med clinics, okay? 
[03:22:30]  If you're so pro-life, do me a favor.  Lock arms and block cemeteries, okay?  Let's see how committed you are to this idea.  She can't come in.  She was 98.  She was hit by a bus.  There's options.  Are we going to have her stuffed?  What are we going to do with her?  We're pro-life.  That's the same look smokers give you, too.  I'm a non-smoker. 
[03:23:00]  I'm a pro-life non-smoker.  I'm getting that look a lot these days because I started smoking again.  And I had nine months without a cigarette, and I started again.  And I'm getting that look.  Are you applauding me starting or stopping?  What are you?  The smokers are, hey, you're back.  Non-smokers are terrible.  I can't believe he started again.  Why?  After nine months.  I have this belief.  If that scenario is at all true when you die and you go to heaven and St. Peter meets you at the gate, I have this belief. 
[03:23:30]  The first thing he's going to ask you is, you got a light?  You mean you all smoke here?  Yeah, that's why it's heaven.  These aren't clouds.  This is cigarette smoke, pal.  Hell is the non-smoking section.  You want to look at them for a minute?  Okay.  I can't believe what they do to their bodies.  It's so smelly.  It smells like an ashtray.  Why do they want me to smell that?  God, that's hellish.  Exactly.  Light up and come on in.  Hendrix is on harp tonight. 
[03:24:00]  So I've been traveling.  I was in Australia.  I was in Australia over Easter, which was interesting to note.  They celebrate Easter the same way we do, commemorating the death and resurrection of Jesus by telling our children a giant bunny rabbit left chocolate eggs in the night.  I wonder why we're messed up as a race.  Anybody got any clues?  I've read the Bible, can't find the word bunny or chocolate anywhere in the book. 
[03:24:30]  Why those two things?  Why not, you know, goldfish left Lincoln logs in your sock drawer, you know, just making stuff up?  Go hog wild.  But I think it's interesting to note how people act on religious beliefs.  You know what I mean?  Like a lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks.  Nice sentiment.  But do you think when Jesus comes back, he's really going to want to look at a cross?  Oh, that may be why he hasn't shown up yet. 
[03:25:00]  I'm going, man, they're still wearing crosses, Dad.  I'm not going.  No.  They totally missed the point.  I'm not going.  Forget it.  I'll go back as a bunny.  But, uh...  That's great.  He looks tremendous.  And I've not seen that videotape or any part of it since that night. 
[03:25:30]  And seeing it now, it raises the question, what was the matter with me?  What was I thinking?  That was just tremendous.  He, if anything, says a great deal about me.  It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill.  Because there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Just perfect.  And the fact that, and I expected it to be somewhat dated, being that old, man, it's not.  It's just great.  In fact, I guess this speaks to the suggestion that he was way ahead of it. </pre>
