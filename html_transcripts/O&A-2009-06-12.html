<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recounting of their appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, including a lavish post-show dinner at STK Steakhouse with Fallon (who initially tried to count calories before abandoning the effort), featuring excessive desserts.  Jimmy Norton was initially absent.  They discussed unexpectedly encountering Anthony Michael Hall at a nearby table, noting his prior cancellation of an appearance on their show due to the "Sex for Sam" controversy and Opie's annoyance at celebrities' familiarity with Norton.  The hosts also detailed their encounter with Rod Blagojevich outside NBC, his apparent attempts to solicit attention, and the international makeup of the *Tonight Show* audience (Canadians, Argentinians, and Spaniards), affecting their performance and resulting edits, including the removal of a Joy Philbin joke.  Opie's pre-show anxiety was discussed, along with humorous listener commentary.  The segment detailing the dinner included a funny interaction involving the waiter and Sam's dietary restrictions.

A significant portion of the show featured a phone call with Kevin Smith.  Smith discussed filming *A Couple of Dicks*, working with Bruce Willis and other cast members, and promoted his upcoming Carnegie Hall appearance.  He detailed his surprisingly successful performance as a goalie in a Walter Gretzky hockey tournament and his encounter with Walter Gretzky.  The conversation continued with Smith detailing his Hollywood experiences, focusing on his directorial choices and interactions with celebrities like Guillermo Diaz,  Robert De Niro (whom he attempted to trick into a photo), Gene Simmons (whom he had a confrontational NPR interview with and alleges tried to sleep with his girlfriend), and Wayne Gretzky.  A detailed, scene-by-scene analysis of the 1973 TV movie *Don't Be Afraid of the Dark* followed, along with tangents on other films, actors (including a critique of several remakes and comparisons of Dracula portrayals), *The Godfather*, and further promotion of Smith's Carnegie Hall event and discussions on Twitter and celebrity culture.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Chaz Bono's transition, featuring crude jokes and graphic, offensive language regarding transgender individuals and genitalia.  This segued into anecdotes (including one host being caught in a closet), a studio food search, and the viewing of explicit internet videos, including one depicting self-electrocution.  Malcolm, a friend of one of the hosts, joined the conversation, discussing his relationships and sexual experiences using vulgar language.  Steve, Sam, and Travis were briefly introduced, with their physical attributes and perceived sexual orientations being the subject of crude and offensive jokes.  Further discussion of the Carnegie Hall show and more off-color jokes concluded this segment.

Patrice O'Neal then joined the show.  His discussion began with his illness, using extremely vulgar language and offensive racial generalizations.  This transitioned to his views on veganism, a critique of brown rice, and a broader discussion on food preferences.  A significant portion involved highly offensive racial stereotypes and humor regarding watermelon consumption, referencing a Petey Green video.  The conversation shifted to serial killers, specifically focusing on racial disparities in their perception and reporting, using racist and offensive language.  Promotion of O'Neal's comedy shows, a brief discussion of the hosts' relationship dynamics, and an analysis of the NBA finals with offensive racial stereotypes and commentary on basketball players followed.  The segment concluded with further discussion on tattoos and their cultural implications, including offensive remarks on women.

The next segment focused on the fallout from David Letterman's joke about Sarah Palin, contrasting the reaction with the perceived lack of outrage towards jokes about Michelle Obama, and speculating on the business implications for Letterman.  A discussion about tattoos followed, spurred by a caller's extensive back tattoos commemorating his deceased children, including frank and crude commentary.  The hosts then discussed women in sports media, expressing their preference for male commentators with misogynistic explanations.  Finally, MC Hammer joined the show.  The interview covered his career, including his early success, financial struggles, business ventures, and new reality TV show, "Hammer Time."  It included playful banter and interruptions, touching on his past successes, business acumen, relationships with employees, decision-making, and use of social media.

The final segment featured MC Hammer discussing his past financial struggles, particularly his bankruptcy resulting from his generosity towards employees (including co-signing for 60 cars).  He explained his motivations, the pressures of needing big hits to sustain this support, and the unintended consequences of his actions.  He discussed his creative process, balancing upbeat music with social issues, and the shift in his songwriting due to financial pressures, heavily promoting "Hammer Time" before the broadcast abruptly ended due to a technical issue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this is forever. Let's get the show on the road.  Why is everything so loud?  All right. Well, we made the effort. We showed up. Take it easy. We'll see you Monday.  How bad do you want to go home right now?  Oh, my God.  How bad do you want to go home?  Dude, I want to be home immediately.  I can't even front.  Oh, thank you, Danny.  I even did some of that drinking last night.  Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.  Did a little of that drinking.  Here you go, sir. 
[00:00:30]  I could find a wall socket, I guess, over there by the table.  Sorry, just having to convey that my phone needs a charging.  Ah!  Yeah, it was sitting out all night.  Yeah, I...  Like me.  Yeah, we did the Jimmy Fallon thing.  Then we decided to go downtown and celebrate a little bit with some food.  Nice.  And some wine.  Wine.  And a shitload of desserts.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy was calorie counting his ass off.  Norton went with us.  And he's the one that's not here yet. 
[00:01:00]  And he wasn't doing any of that drinking.  No, no.  What the fuck?  There is no way he was calorie counting.  It was...  What?  It was a mess.  Yeah, I know.  The table was covered with dessert.  It was awesome.  They treated us nice.  After we ate our faces off, the entire table was covered with, like, every kind of dessert.  And Jimmy kept yelling at everybody.  He was like, give me that!  You'd be shoveling half of it off onto your plate. 
[00:01:30]  You'd be like, hurry!  Give me that!  Is that a banana?  He was panicking.  I think he finally said, all right, no calorie counting today.  Yeah, yeah.  He was done with it.  Absolutely, but I don't know.  I don't know what it was, but I had so much effing fun yesterday.  That was great.  I usually panic my ass off when it comes to TV.  I don't really...  I think a lot of people know I don't really like doing TV.  It was fun, man.  But it was a lot of fun.  The people that Jimmy Fallon ruled.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:00]  And then the night ends with Anthony Michael Hall.  What was that about?  It annoyed me.  Why?  Well, because Anthony Michael Hall was sitting at the table, I guess, kind of next to behind us.  Yeah, we had a booth, and then he was...  Yeah, he was the booth right there.  And I hear...  Jimmy!  And Norton turns around, and he goes, hey!  Tips his head, he gives a wave, he gets right up, and walks over to somebody.  I'm like, oh, someone, a fan?  Sure.  Must know Jimmy.  And there it is. 
[00:02:30]  Anthony Michael Hall.  Shaking Jimmy's hand.  They're giving a little hug.  I was starstruck.  I'm like...  That guy's been in some great effing movies, man.  Damn, Anthony Michael Hall is a Jimmy Norton fan.  And you know, whenever celebrities know Jimmy, I get annoyed.  And then I had to ask Jimmy, I'm like, Jimmy, could you get him to take a picture with me?  I turned into Norton.  But he knew us.  Yeah, he did.  The problem is we do radio, so we're not recognizable.  I know. 
[00:03:00]  No, he absolutely knew who we were.  Got to do a little more of that TV thing.  Yeah, apparently.  Just a little bit.  But it was awkward because he knew Jimmy and kind of was buddy-buddy with Jimmy there.  Yeah.  And I wanted a picture, so I had to ask Jimmy to get me a picture with him.  That was cool, though.  He was like, all right, are we leaving now?  Okay, I'll go over and...  All right, Jimmy.  Yeah, what's up, B-Rock?  Doesn't he hate you guys?  Not really.  No, there was a whole issue with booking. 
[00:03:30]  Well, no, no.  The story goes really fast.  When we did our Sex for Sam, which got us fired, they actually put us on the air the next day.  And Anthony Michael Hall was scheduled to be on our show.  And the controversy already hit the news everywhere.  And he didn't think it was good for his reputation.  They pulled him.  Yeah, they pulled him from our show, basically.  He had nothing to do with that.  Yeah, but I've known over the last five years he's also canceled any time we've tried to book him, too. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, really?  He'd pass on us.  I think it's his peeps, because apparently Jimmy and he himself said that, yeah, he wants to come on the show and give him a call.  And he'll come on.  I'd love to have him on.  Yeah.  He's done some great movies.  I like the Dead Zone TV show.  It was very good.  It was weird.  The night started.  We tweeted our ass off.  Oh, yeah.  The night started with that picture that E-Rock put up on my Twitter. 
[00:04:30]  I couldn't stop laughing at this.  I walked up to...  Oh, my God.  Look, you're pointing.  He thought it was a gun.  He looked down, like, all freaked out.  It would have been funny if you did.  Yeah.  I pull up to the big Jimmy Fallon taping.  I'm getting ready to go inside, and Blakoyevich is outside.  Blakoyevich.  What was he?  He was the mayor?  No, he was the governor.  Governor.  Governor of Illinois.  Excuse me.  A little bigger job.  And then when Obama left to become the president, the open seat, he was trying to, like, sell 
[00:05:00]  it, allegedly.  You know, it's Lego hair guy.  Yeah.  And he was just standing outside NBC.  How did you recognize him?  For real.  Well, he's been on everything, I know.  But you know something?  I am terrible with that.  You wouldn't recognize that guy.  I would have looked at him and gone, I know him from somewhere, but I wouldn't have known  it was Blakoyevich.  Yeah.  No, I recognize him right away, and a lot of other people. 
[00:05:30]  And then we did a little reconnaissance, and it turns out he had no reason to be at NBC.  He was just hanging out, hoping to get recognized.  He is a publicity hound.  Standby tickets.  With Pat from Monaki.  I didn't get in.  He was telling everybody his story as we were walking into NBC.  He's standing there with his little rejection ticket, and he's like, I didn't get in.  Yeah, I felt so bad for him.  I know.  We were trying to get Pat into the taping last night, but it didn't work. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, well.  Sorry.  Now, Blakoyevich, so you went up to him and just said, hey, could I get a picture with  you?  Yeah, he was excited.  And who took the picture?  My girl.  Ah.  On the BlackBerry.  Right, the BlackBerry.  He was all excited that you recognized.  But then it was like a paparazzi or something there.  And all of a sudden, maybe it wasn't a paparazzi, but it was a paparazzi type camera.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, this guy gives the camera to my girl, and she's now taking like a million  pictures for everybody. 
[00:06:30]  They were just taking turns getting pictures with Blakoyevich.  Yeah, he's kind of the clowny guy to get a picture with now.  And I was goofing.  He just wandered Manhattan looking.  And for the ridiculous haters that have to pick on everything, I purposely misspelled  his name on my Twitter, because how the fuck do you...  I could have looked it up, but I was just like, fuck.  I think it sounds kind of like this.  And then I threw a few Zs and stuff in there just to be silly.  T.C.  Who could just spell...  Who cares?  Who could spell it? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock was in the audience for the Jimmy Fallon taping.  Yes, he was.  He was telling me a few minutes ago that basically, the studio audience was not from this country.  Yeah, yeah.  Which doesn't fare well for an Opie and Anthony appearance.  No, apparently they were all from...  Where were they from, Iraq?  Other lands.  There were groups from...  Well, the biggest group was from Canada.  But there was Argentina and Spain.  Ah, that was good.  Oh, we're really big in Argentina and Spain. 
[00:07:30]  Representing.  We need an East Coast audience is what we need.  Hey, there you go.  There's the desserts.  Oh, the desserts.  But...  Mmm.  This cotton candy came to the table.  Ooh.  That was...  And then Jimmy started talking.  He pulled it up all fluffy on top, the cotton candy, and then started asking questions that  he would ask Kenny because it's the same texture as Kenny's hair.  So he was talking to the cotton candy.  We were laughing and laughing. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it could have been the wine talking.  Oh.  God.  Well, not with Jimmy, but...  And then what?  But he's not here.  He's the one that doesn't drink.  He's the one that doesn't drink.  He doesn't drink at all.  And then I had stupid acid reflux keeping me up all fucking...  Oh, did you?  What the hell did I eat?  We ate a lot.  Yeah, we did eat a lot.  A lot of crap, too.  So that picture looks like the website we were looking at yesterday.  This is whyyou'refat.com.  Yes.  Yeah, I liked all those desserts. 
[00:08:30]  Wow, they cut the shit out of the appearance.  Yeah.  Right after the taping was over, Fallon leaned over and goes, guys, that was only supposed  to be seven.  That was about 10 or 11.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do because I liked all of it.  I know.  We were sitting there like, oh, no, they're going to have to cut.  And we could say this because there's a few people going, they haven't seen the appearance  yet, but Anthony had an unbelievable line to end the entire thing.  And Jimmy Fallon gave me a tweet late in the night and said, got to tell you, Anthony's 
[00:09:00]  line was line of the interview.  Had to cut it.  Had to cut it.  Had to cut it.  Yeah.  You basically made a Joy Philbin pussy joke.  You were talking about Regis.  Well, when you put it that way.  You were talking about Regis Philbin's wife's pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In such a way, honestly, that they could have kept it in, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't dirty or anything.  No.  No.  It was that old game you used to play as a kid. 
[00:09:30]  Slip your fingers.  Where you put your hands together, like you're clapping, then you spread your fingers, then  one guy goes sideways.  One guy goes straight up and down.  You interlock them now.  Right.  In between the ring finger and the middle finger.  Right.  And then the one guy opens up his hand and it looks like a little pussy.  Right.  And then you made some comment that it looked like Joy Philbin's pussy or something.  And they cut the line, Jimmy.  They cut it, Jimmy.  Jimmy has arrived.  Jimmy just shook his head. 
[00:10:00]  And they should have left it in, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  That wasn't dirty or anything.  You know, I did that thing with my wife recently.  Yeah, huh?  And she laughed at me.  She goes, that doesn't look like a pussy.  Of course it doesn't.  And I go, well, if you're 10, it does.  When we were doing that, what the fuck did we know?  I know.  It was all fun and games.  Did they cut anything else?  But, yeah.  Well, they had to.  They had to knock it down three minutes.  Oh.  Some of the silly radio talk we were talking about, like, all the dumb things radio shows do. 
[00:10:30]  They didn't have.  I'm trying to think what else.  What else they cut, E-Rock?  You know.  It was most of the first couple minutes when we came out there.  Oh, the driving into work and all that.  Oh, right.  Which was pretty good.  See, there's another one.  Yeah, yeah.  They cut out.  You talked about the driving into work.  They cut out me going through the laundry list of the dumb stuff radio guys do.  Yeah.  They cut out your joy line.  Joy.  It's so weird.  Did they leave the C-bomb?  Yeah, yeah.  They left C-bomb.  Oh, okay. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Did they leave the fight with the Roots?  The Philadelphia joke did not go over well with most of the audience.  But they left the Philadelphia.  Did they leave?  I'm not sure if.  I'm not sure.  Now, because that was right when I came into the room and I was running and I clicked the TV on and that's the part that was on.  So I was like, aha.  God, I wasn't able to really catch it.  You were too busy?  If the whole thing went through.  Were you too busy to watch yourself?  Yeah.  I was out with Keithy.  I went right to bed. 
[00:11:30]  Nah, I was out.  I was a bad boy.  I stayed out.  What time did you get home?  I don't know.  Nah, I got home.  So it was about kind of getting through our appearance there.  So I was at one.  Right.  I got back to the room sometime.  One.  One-ish.  I want to know how they ended the whole thing.  Because you had the killer line about Joy Philbin's twat.  And then I leaned over to you and I went, well, there's our out.  Yeah, yeah.  You said, there's our out.  So I don't know how.  Did they get rid of that line too? 
[00:12:00]  They must have.  I said, I think for good.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Where's, do we have a copy of it?  It's coming.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  It's coming.  Somebody's saying there were three obvious edits.  Let me go to Devin in Canada.  Okay.  Jimmy, we learned that the audience was from Spain and Argentina.  Argentina and then some Canadians.  That was where the audience came from.  Yeah.  Which, lucky for you guys, is the demo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We always look for Spain, Spanish, and Argentinians. 
[00:12:30]  We were talking to the Jimmy Fallon people.  We were like, look, let's stack the audience with ONA fans, man.  You'll get a hell of a reaction.  Or we will.  Now I'm surprised we got reactions with an audience like that.  Devin, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  You know, a lot of Canadians, the hip ones, they know who you are.  Yeah, three really shitty edits, actually.  Really?  It just jumped out.  But the last line was the Regis imitation, but not anything about joy. 
[00:13:00]  It was talking about the gay guys on his show?  Yeah, it was the American Idol, and then boom.  And just that obvious cut and out.  Time's up.  Got to go.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I hate to say it, but we had a great ending.  That was a good ending.  The only joke was, I look like I belong in Philadelphia, and then the roots.  That was good.  I thought that was funny.  Did they show Ant going, when the roots got mad, did they show Ant going, no, no, I mean 
[00:13:30]  the movie, not the city.  Yeah.  That's great.  I mean the movie.  It was good.  And you guys came out, and then, Opie, you were all nervous and something about walkers  and old people and walkers with brakes, and then the laugh, and then Opie goes, yeah, the  walkers with the brakes.  Oh, yeah, I was just, uh...  Oh, oh, you repeated the laugh.  We did it just like the show.  Just like the radio show.  Yeah, Ant goes with the brakes, and then there's a laugh, and then when the laugh comes out,  I don't know, what were you thinking about, Opie, when you were up there? 
[00:14:00]  What were you thinking about?  Oh, I don't know.  I was thinking that maybe there's a million people looking at us right now.  I was going, what about the walkers with the brakes?  You know what happened?  That is funny, because we do that constantly on the show.  I had that line in my head, so I was just waiting for my turn to say it, but I wasn't  really listening, and then Anthony said it.  So, fuck's it?  Something about the handbrake.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't even realize that.  Holy shit.  You got me sweating.  Thanks, bro.  Oh, that's funny. 
[00:14:30]  It was great, boys.  Cool.  Thank you, bro.  Okay.  All right.  Let's say hi to Robin in Detroit.  Robin.  Good morning, guys.  Hi.  You guys were great.  Last night, and Anthony, when you yelled, shut up.  Oh, good.  That made it?  Oh, it made it.  I rewound it like 10 times.  It was just, you guys were great.  It's always a good thing to do is to tell your audience to shut up.  Yeah.  We hear you say it all the time, but to see you just go like, shut up.  I know.  Well, because they were groaning. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, they started groaning, and it's such a, I mean, everyone gets a groan.  I think, not everyone, but a lot of people get a groan during talk shows like that,  and they just kind of look at the audience and go, what?  Oh, really?  I'm so used to yelling shut up at the listeners on this show that I just decided to yell shut  up without even thinking about it.  It was great.  You probably shouldn't tell the audience to shut up.  It was great, though.  It worked.  It was you guys.  They shut up.  Good for them.  It was you guys being you guys. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, that was fun.  Yes.  Your hair looked marvelous yesterday.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You look very handsome.  You've got to understand that.  I was very happy with my noggin.  Most of us saw Anthony's hair for the first time, because he's back to a hat today.  That was the big debut, because I had a bedhead again.  We were all amazed by how it's growing in.  You can't even make fun of it.  And it's only six months.  You can't even make fun of it.  The one-year mark is the biggie.  Trust me.  I wish we could.  I wish we could fuck with it.  I wish we could make fun of it, but you know what? 
[00:16:00]  We can't.  I told Anthony before he went out how much it would make me happy if they were on panel,  and the hot lights, all of a sudden, Anthony's hair started melting like taffy on his head.  Yeah, for some reason, Jimmy wanted my hair to melt onto the lights, and I thought that  was hysterical.  Like it was warm.  Like it was warm chocolate ice cream.  It's hair.  Why would it melt?  That's the beauty of it.  It shouldn't.  It shouldn't, but in Jimmy's head, it was melting.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Yep.  The Penguins are getting their asses kicked tonight by our Detroit boys.  Oh, shit. 
[00:16:30]  Here it comes.  Yeah, they're going down.  I got to say go Pens.  I'm sorry, Robin.  Yeah, I know.  Well, you know, fuck them.  We're going to kick their ass tonight.  I'll be watching Game 7 somewhere.  Maybe at FH Riley's tonight.  I think there's a little gathering there.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  All right.  Your Pens are going to lose, but that's all right.  All right, Robin.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  Thank you.  Bye.  Robin, good call.  Well, Eric from Long Island writes, Opie wasn't nervous.  He was imagining how much cum it would take to fill Jimmy Fallon's studio.  That's a lot of cum. 
[00:17:00]  He's got a big studio.  We were all psyched about that, too.  I was really freaking out about that whole thing.  And I don't know if a lot of people can relate.  I mean, I don't know how many people have been on talk shows, but that was the original  Tonight Show studio from when Johnny Carson was in New York.  Which goes way, which goes way, which goes way back before he went to L.A.  He did the show in New York.  So they had a poster up a picture, a big picture in the in the green room of Carson and Ed McMahon 
[00:17:30]  and Nancy Sinatra.  You mean the picture I tweeted last night, Anthony?  Yes.  And then there's Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Tony Curtis.  Oh, that is Tony Curtis.  On stage at the Tonight Show.  And it was just to be sitting there, obviously, different furniture.  But you're in the same place, you know, in history.  To me, it was just a huge thing.  I was like, I can't believe I'm in that studio.  As a kid, when my parents would have the Tonight Show on while they were yelling at each other 
[00:18:00]  and I was crying, I would watch that.  And then you think, here it is, years later, and you're walking out on that stage.  That's just fucked up.  It really is just an odd thing.  You never think it's going to happen.  It's fucked up to wrap your arms around.  Yeah.  I think the couch and the desk are pretty much in the same place, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like the same angle, right?  Yeah.  The same background.  Huh?  These little cutouts here, it's the same background that he's using.  Yeah, it is, right?  It's very cool, though. 
[00:18:30]  It was like a very cool thing.  I agree with you, but it would be very funny if you tried to share it with one of the light techs.  Like, you're about to go out, and you're like, you know, it's just amazing.  I was a little kid, and here I am today, and he went, very interesting.  Two minutes.  Yeah.  Two minutes.  Okay.  Two minutes.  At the, what was it, the stage director or whatever she is, who was she that came down?  She was the one that told us, okay, go out here.  Yeah.  She goes, here's where the curtain is.  Don't bang into this.  And then she goes, and there's a little bit of wall that sticks out here. 
[00:19:00]  She goes, don't bang into it.  A lot of people do.  And we're like, okay, all right.  And Jimmy Fallon introduces us.  I walk square into that wall.  I hit it with my shoulder.  Bam.  Walked right into the goddamn thing like an idiot.  I don't think the camera was on us at that point.  I don't think so.  But, yeah.  Ow.  Last night, we ate at STK Steakhouse.  Yeah.  26 Little West 12th Street.  They got locations in Miami, L.A., and New York. 
[00:19:30]  Ah.  I just wanted to say that.  What a bunch of great info you got on that place.  That food was, honestly, that food was phenomenal last night.  Unbelievably good.  I stopped calorie counting because they have this bread.  It looks like they put melted cheese on it or something.  And then there's a green sauce you dip it in.  Oh, you kept going back for that bread.  Dude, my fucking, I shoveled so much of that food in my face.  It was awesome.  I was also talking about dessert.  dessert, when all the desserts came to the table.  Because I was like, oh, I'd like to see a dessert menu maybe. 
[00:20:00]  I still got a little bit of room left in me.  Let me have the dessert menu.  And no dessert menu.  They brought over, like, every dessert they had and just plunked it down on our table.  And as I told everybody there, Jim, as I was shoveling it onto my plate, one of them,  you were just yelling at everybody, give me that!  Give me that one!  Gimme!  Have a job!  Gimme!  But our favorite was, because Jimmy has obviously arrived.  Our favorite was you talking to the cotton candy like it was Kenny.  Like it was Kenny's hair.  Because he's got the same, because the cotton candy is the same type of hair Kenny has. 
[00:20:30]  Yes!  Nice and dry.  Dude, I never, I, the idea of sharing the, the, the desserts were amazing.  I, I would never.  Share desserts?  Never!  Yeah.  But I was like, I'll try it one, and then every one I had to just, like, dip half on.  I was Gary Grady last night.  It was so goddamn good.  It was awesome.  And young Sam was with us.  Yeah.  Young Sam was with us.  And when, when the waiter came over and, and was going through the specials, he was going  through some stuff.  And you know Sam is very particular with what he eats. 
[00:21:00]  He eats chicken fingers.  Pizza.  Pizza.  He eats children's food.  Yeah.  Picture any seven or eight year old child and what they like for dinner.  And that's what he eats.  He doesn't eat beef.  Yeah.  He doesn't.  Anything like that.  He's never had a steak.  Well, we made him eat steak on our show.  Yeah, we made him one, one day.  Yeah.  So the waiter comes over and he starts, uh, talking about the specials.  And he was talking about foie gras.  And, uh, I just went over to the waiter.  I go, and I pointed at him and I'm like, oh, I go, Sam loves foie gras. 
[00:21:30]  That's, yeah.  And he's looking at me like, he's smiling with that.  Yep.  No, I don't look on his face.  Yeah, but now the waiter was giving all his attention to Sam to explain how great  they're from, I can't even say it.  Yeah, foie gras.  Foie gras is.  Which is, what the hell is that?  Like goose liver?  It's goose liver.  Yeah.  It was, it was, uh, I ate a steak and something else.  And, uh, you know, it was just like a celebrity hangout, apparently.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Who knew?  All right.  We mentioned that, you ass. 
[00:22:00]  What?  Well, the fact that Anthony Michael Hall.  I forgot about that.  He was there.  Yeah, we already did that.  Was at the table behind us.  And I just hear, Jimmy.  Well, you know what?  And I thought it was a fan.  Here's a celebrity that knows me and Anthony, too.  Yes.  Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith.  Hey, Kevin.  There he is.  Look, Jimmy Gordon.  Kevin Smith, how are you, my friend?  Don't mind.  I don't mind.  How are you?  Good.  Have you been up all night? 
[00:22:30]  What a great day.  Have you been up all night, too?  I'm wide awake.  I have been.  We had shot.  Our call time was like 7 o'clock, 7.30.  So, I've been at work all night.  And those things don't end quickly.  No.  It's not like, yeah, you call at 7.30 and you'll be done by 10.  It just ended.  It doesn't happen that way.  Like a half an hour ago.  And it was.  Oh, my God.  I mean, it's not hard work.  You know what I'm saying?  But it's just.  It's tiring.  It's long.  It's long.  But still, you never feel like you could complain or bitch about it because you're like. 
[00:23:00]  It's a great life.  What a fucking good life.  It's a great life.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's crawling up into an attic.  It's just.  And also, I mean, you got to just come and observe for a day.  And just watch.  Never mind what's going on in front of the camera.  Watch how easy I have it.  You just stare at me all day long.  People just come over and just go like, do you want a chicken wrap?  And I'm like, um, you know, that sounds good.  And then the chicken wrap comes with a bottle of water and a yoo-hoo.  And then somebody comes by and a big basket of Philadelphia pretzels. 
[00:23:30]  Hot.  And they got a bottle of mustard, bottle of Cheez Whiz.  And not the can, like the squeezy bottle kind.  So you can get even more onset pretzels.  Taste that book of flavor.  Very much so.  Is that pretty much what it is?  Would you like a pretzel?  Absolutely.  And it's just amazing.  And people go like, you know, I'm standing there.  And it's raining on everybody.  Yeah.  And then, you know, somebody, some lady on the crew will have an umbrella and be like,  oh, here you go. 
[00:24:00]  Here.  I'm like, oh, no.  Come on.  You keep it.  Hold this over your head.  It's tough.  I mean, it's a tough life.  It's weird, though, because you've always got to be careful, man, because you can't just  do anything lightly.  You can't just be like, man, you know, I wish we can wipe out an entire nation.  Because people will make it happen for you.  Okay.  Hey, Kevin wants to wipe out an entire nation.  Oh, my God.  They're like, he never asks for anything.  He just said this.  Let's do this for him.  You've got to be careful what you throw out there, because they do it for you.  There's such a, what a great crew. 
[00:24:30]  The crew on this movie, one of the best crews I ever worked with, if not, hands down, the  best crew.  Oh, we got, can I give names that don't, it's more people to death.  It is.  It's like an Academy Award.  Totally.  We'll never win, so.  But we got these two dudes on the movie, Mike Tadges and Ray Quinlan.  Dudes who are like, old New York guy, the Silver Foxes we call them, they got white hair  and whatnot.  These motherfuckers have worked on every movie ever made since the beginning of time.  Ben Hur was there.  Pretty much, they're like, well, when D.W. Griffith made, and you're like, that is 
[00:25:00]  going back.  They're like, we were, well, when we were at the Black Mariah, when good old Edison founded  film.  They've just like, seriously, they'll be sitting there, and he's going, like, Tadges will be  talking to him.  He's like, well, we ran into a problem on Kentucky Fried Movie once, but I was like, and you're  like, Kentucky Fried Movie?  Stop it.  Oh, it's amazing.  And Quinlan was like Woody Allen's gaffer for years and years and years, and now he's like  the PM, and they're just two, like, classic New York film people, man. 
[00:25:30]  That's awesome.  Not even film, movie people.  Whole crew's like that.  Wonderful people across the board.  Movie looks fucking amazing.  Yeah.  It really does.  Honestly, people will see what the movie looks like, and they'll assume that I had nothing  to do with it.  Because it looks like a movie, dude.  Like, you know, like, we passed, here's the good news, we passed the Warner Brothers  muster test.  Warner Brothers, very corporate, very organized, and very like, look, we have a thing we do,  and if you don't match up to it, we'll let you know pretty fucking quickly. 
[00:26:00]  So they're looking at your first week of dailies, at least for me.  I think if I'd done it once, then they'd be like, okay, we can trust them.  But like, their first time with me, my first time with them.  So, you know, every step of the way, they're going to be looking at everything.  But we passed the dailies test.  Like, they've been like, stuff looks great.  Which means we look like a Warner Brothers movie.  It looks like a real movie.  You know what I'm saying?  And then every day, you just go like, wow, we're one step closer to seeing that dopey  ass shield at the front that, like, I used to see in front of cartoons, you know, growing  up.  See, we were just talking about that. 
[00:26:30]  I know.  I can't wait, man.  I can't wait.  That's awesome.  How is Bruce Willis?  I'm going to ask a real girl question.  How is Bruce Willis?  Dreamy.  Bruce Willis is dreamy.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis, man.  It's like you're sitting there talking to Bruce Willis, and the whole time, your head,  inside your head, you're just screaming.  You're like, it's fucking Bruce Willis!  It's John McLean!  It's David Anderson!  It's Hudson Hogg!  You're speaking to living history.  You'll be dead and forgotten.  They'll still have pictures of this dude at a Suncoast video store if they're open ever 
[00:27:00]  again.  Like, this man's a living legend.  So there's that aspect to him, and then there's just the other aspect to him, where you're like,  can you do that again, please?  And you feel like, you know, the first time I had to actually like...  You're almost scared to say that, right?  You're the boss, though!  I know.  But you are, and you aren't.  Like, really, there's one boss in a Bruce Willis movie.  We all know who it is.  But there's that initial moment where I'm like, okay, I gotta give my first piece of  direction.  And my direction is never like, you know, I'll go over and be like, you know, I work  with this cat, you know.  It's not like I went over and said, okay, in this scene, what you're feeling is anxious. 
[00:27:30]  You know, you're feeling anxious.  I just come over, and I'm just like, all right, so do it right.  And throw in your own things.  Well, I understand that Bruce and I are similar in that way.  We kind of both work well off kind of a loose direction.  You're both not exactly technical actors.  Men of similar ilk, as they say.  Cut from the same cloth.  Yeah, but I'm the kind of guy who'll sit behind the monitor, and I'm looking at what's going  on, and if somebody kind of flubs the line or doesn't do it the way I heard it when I 
[00:28:00]  read it, you know, or maybe misses something or a key word, I just shout it out.  I'm like, go back.  Give me that again.  And, you know, I'm just used to doing that with everybody.  And the first time I did it with them, I bit my tongue right afterward, because I'm  like, I don't know if you could do that with this guy.  Here we go.  He's going to turn around and go, yeah, right, like you know.  That's the thing.  I'm like, I'm going to get shut down in front of the casting crew.  He's going to turn around and be like, excuse me.  This is not.  He'll put that smirk smile on.  Not even.  You're looking for the smirk.  Hope and I just spit.  You're looking for the, sorry, you saw it, too, and I had to call it out. 
[00:28:30]  So Jimmy's eye went, put it on eBay.  Kevin Smith spit.  Let's analyze it.  Make sure there's no semen in it.  I don't know.  It was a long night.  Maybe.  Let me try to remember.  Oh, wow.  Look at that picture.  That's from back in the Live Free, Die Hard promotion.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Are you and Bruce on the steps?  Yes.  That's a fake New York street.  You're ready to sing Waiting for a Friend.  Yeah.  Look at that picture.  I'm just like, lips or hips? 
[00:29:00]  I'm about to go down.  I'm just like, ah.  I'm at the point where my heart arched back as far as I go.  Now I'm going to lean forward.  Now, when you got to direct him, if you got to say like, all right, look, can you do that  again?  Do you try to blame it on something else?  Yeah.  The light wasn't right in that one.  No.  I go, please.  Can you do it again?  Because it's my fault.  No.  I don't have to make excuses.  It's like, you know, that's the happy thing is I found out that the dude's like, you could  do it.  You could, you know, in mid take.  I mean, because let's be honest, dude, we're not making fucking Schindler's list here. 
[00:29:30]  You know, it's not like we have to go to a deep emotive place.  The movie's called A Couple of Dicks.  We got some wiggle room to, you know, not be so craft oriented.  Mr. Director, la-dee-da.  Exactly.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Kevin.  Kevin, you look very relaxed.  I am very relaxed.  Heading into this movie, you were anxious because we got to have you in the studio.  You know what, dude?  Because I know, and I was tight.  I was all tight.  You look like you're in the zone, my friend.  I am in the zone, dude.  And here's why. 
[00:30:00]  The beginning of June was always going to be real thick and heavy for me because I had the  hockey thing going on, and then I got...  Sorry, I ruined that for you.  It's okay.  And then I had the Carnegie Hall thing going on.  Yeah, we got to promote the hell out of that.  June 17th.  Yeah, let's say it now, and then I'll continue talking.  In fact, I'm not going to say another fucking thing until you pimp Carnegie Hall.  Pimp that.  I'm going.  An evening with Kevin Smith, so it's Wednesday.  Coming up.  Holy shit.  Is he already?  Yes, dude.  How did that happen?  It's fast on the way. 
[00:30:30]  Are you guys going?  We've got a crappy non-summer.  Yes.  Here's the deal.  Absolutely.  I want to pay for it.  I want to pay for a ticket.  You don't have to pay for a ticket.  I got some comps.  I want to pay for a ticket.  I want to support the cause.  Give me...  Here, I get comps.  But I just want to give me the money, so I get to wet my beak a little, you know?  Yeah, but we don't beaks.  We want to make sure this thing sells out, so I want to do...  There's only about 500 tickets left, so we're pretty...  I'm hoping that we're there.  We will absolutely be there Wednesday.  500 tickets.  Come on.  Who's not going?  I've never seen an evening with Kevin Smith.  I've heard nothing but amazing things about him. 
[00:31:00]  I've only seen videos.  I can't wait.  They're amazing.  In Carnegie Hall.  In Carnegie Hall, this coming Wednesday.  Tracy Morgan said he would open.  For real?  Damn, yo.  He did, and I was just like...  I had to stop for a minute, because I was like, I don't know, Trace.  I don't know if I could follow you.  Like, it's one thing...  I'll show my pubic hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But suddenly...  And knowing Tracy, too, if Tracy gets on a roll, like, two and a half hours go by,  and I'll get out for the final half hour and be like, any questions?  And brings up something.  Make sure he doesn't show his pubic hair.  I was at Caroline's once.  He was showing his pubic hair to the front row. 
[00:31:30]  Tracy's hysterical.  Tracy is crushing this movie.  But look at this.  Absolutely crushing this movie in a positive way.  Yeah, we saw photos of him riding, like, dressed like a giant cell phone.  Dressed like a cell phone?  Yeah.  I tell you, I was worried when that picture hit the internet, because I'm like, oh, out  of context.  Will anybody understand?  But people were just like...  I thought the response was really funny.  Most people were just like, this picture makes me want to see the movie.  I'm sold based on this picture.  It was a funny picture.  So, an evening with Kevin Smith this Wednesday.  Only 500 tickets.  So, I mean, you got to get on the horn today, man. 
[00:32:00]  212-247-7800.  Now, how do they get the tickets if they don't call?  Like, carnegiehall.org, I guess?  Yeah.  If you go to the Carnegie Hall website...  Okay.  Carnegiehall.org.  ...and look it up.  ...and is it slash Kevin Smith or something?  Is it a simple address?  That's what...  I don't like the...  If you go to viewaskew.com, you'll see an ad for an evening with Kevin Smith.  That'll help.  ...and that'll help you get to the Carnegie...  I'll be honest.  I don't like the websites that are promoting the show.  A little confusing.  Let's try...  The Carnegie Hall one? 
[00:32:30]  Well, view...  Viewaskew is Kevin's.  That's mine.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  So, let's go there.  Viewaskew.com.  Can you get tickets there, though?  Well, it sends you over to that place.  That's a little link.  And you have fun on that site.  Thank you.  Just call Carnegie Hall.  Yeah, come on.  I want to see Kevin Smith Wednesday.  Help me out.  You know what?  You're resourceful out there.  If you really want to go, you're going to make this happen.  Yes.  And we'll definitely push this Monday and Tuesday as well.  Yeah, let's go back to the movie thing.  Okay, so last weekend, I went to Brantford up in Ontario.  And I entered a team that I played for and three other teams into this Walter Gretzky street 
[00:33:00]  hockey tournament that is the third annual one.  Oh, my God.  That Saturday, top ten day of my life.  Really?  And you know I've had a good life.  That was like one of the ten best days of my life.  It was amazing, dude.  I was supposed to fly out of here at Rapp, but I wasn't going to make the plane because  I had to do laundry and shit.  So, I decided to just be driven there, and I'd sleep in the car.  So, I slept. 
[00:33:30]  The only thing they could get me at the last minute was this ridiculous stretch limo.  So, not only was I going to Brantford, but it's like, Hollywood shows up in a limo, does  he?  Look at him in his fat limo.  The jerk.  But they drove me up there, and I woke up, and just as we were getting to Brantford, and  my wife was already there.  She'd flown in.  And there was like three hours before the first game.  And the first game, I have not played a full game of stick in 15 years.  And I was goalie then, and as I was this weekend as well.  I was a fucking god. 
[00:34:00]  Really?  It was insane, dude.  It was like I was possessed.  It was like Ghost Dad or something like that.  If my father had been any good at being a goalie.  It was like something entered me, man.  God damn.  Dude, look at this.  I stoned three penalty shots.  If you see it, yeah, there's one on YouTube.  And what happened is these guys who were playing, the Bulgarians, their goalie took the shot.  Wait a minute, dude.  Hey, what's up, their goalie?  You got skills in that.  Dude, I'm saying, I was kind of, watch this.  I thought you were just leaving this safe. 
[00:34:30]  Blitzed.  Damn.  Blanked.  That was textbook.  Fuck you, McCutche.  Next customer.  And then two more I blanked, dude.  I was on, and look, I'm not saying like, oh, I missed my calling.  This film thing was a waste of time.  Why didn't I stick with Street Huggie?  But I was shocked at for, come on, fucking look at me.  I'm a fat fucking man.  I was dropping and popping, dude.  You were moving right there.  Oh, my God.  I would drop to my knees, pop right the fuck back up.  Look at the crowd.  They're loving the save.  How did you feel the next day? 
[00:35:00]  Like shit.  Like, that whole day I was like, I never want to stop doing this.  The next day I was like, what am I, retarded?  I'm 30, almost 39 years old.  I shouldn't be doing this.  I was a kid.  This didn't hurt the next day.  We played the first game.  Our team lost.  We were kind of shorthanded.  We didn't have as many people for the rotation because two people dropped out.  So we played this team, the Reapers.  Was it the Reapers?  Yeah, the Reapers.  And we lost 7-2.  But it was still fun.  Like, funny as fuck, right?  And then the next game we only lost by one. 
[00:35:30]  And then the last game we actually won.  And it was pretty amazing.  That's awesome.  We won.  I won that game.  Any hockey legends up there?  Walter Gretzky, man.  Of course.  The father of Wayne Gretzky, who I met.  And we went to the Varadi house, the house where they grew up on, Varadi Ave, which he  maintained.  He kept all these years and lives in.  And so he takes you on a tour.  You can see the basement.  It's just like the basement that makes you feel like a total dick who wasted your youth  and childhood.  Because it is wall-to-wall trophies.  And they're not just Wayne Gretzky's trophies. 
[00:36:00]  They're all the kids.  Because every kid, every one of these fucking Gretzky kids was up to something.  And they were busy all through high school winning trophies and shit.  What were you doing?  I was like, I was trying.  I was literally bent with my legs thrown over my fucking neck trying to suck my own cup.  That's what I was doing.  I was like, I know it can be done.  I can reach the tongue.  I'm just playing the tip.  The trophy looks odd for that one.  Well, they should give you a trophy if you could get that.  You were trying to play tonsil hockey. 
[00:36:30]  That's fine.  Absolutely.  I'm the great one at tonsil hockey.  They should hand out trophies.  Oh, it was amazing, though.  I met the dude, and he was so fucking nice.  This dude is a saint on earth.  Took me for the tour through the house.  Sat around.  We went into the backyard, dude.  The backyard, which now is a swimming pool in it.  But this is the backyard where fucking Wayne Gretzky learned to skate and play.  Yeah.  This is where he learned to skate to the puck.  It's powerful, dude.  You stay in that backyard.  You're like...  Homemade rake in the backyard.  That's what he...  He was one of those kids.  Yeah.  Like, his dad put up the sprinklers, and it would create the ice, and then he'd smooth it out. 
[00:37:00]  This might be a little obscure, but didn't Wayne's brother play?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  But did he make it to the NHL?  I think two of his brothers played.  Because when I was first starting in radio, I think he was playing in Rochester.  Dude, that's...  For the Amherst or something.  Sorry.  That's got to suck, though.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  That's why I brought it up.  You don't want to be Wayne Gretzky's brother, man.  I think everyone in the family copped to that, too.  They're just like, it's difficult.  I could have been a good hockey player, but I wasn't fucking great.  No one said.  Somebody said that his brother was a really good hockey player. 
[00:37:30]  Would have been a really good hockey player had he not been Wayne Gretzky's brother.  That was the word when I was in Rochester, like, here's the next Wayne Gretzky.  It's his brother.  They always would say he's just as good, if not better.  But obviously, he never really did much in the NHL.  You can only get one Wayne Gretzky in a lifetime.  You never heard of Ted Rivera, did you?  No.  It's Mariano.  Yeah, where's Mariano's brother, you know?  Have you met Gretzky?  No.  I don't think I want to.  Why?  Gretzky means too much to me.  I don't think I can meet him.  I'm sure he probably knows your work.  That's got to be great.  You're meeting him as a guy who probably enjoys your work. 
[00:38:00]  You know what it's like?  It's like that scene.  You remember, I don't know if you remember, Last Temptation of Christ, at one point when  Willem Dafoe steps off the cross and he goes, lives a life for 20 minutes and shit, he comes  across Harry Dean Stanton, who's playing Paul, the apostle, the disciple.  And, you know, Paul used to fucking persecute Christians and Jews.  And then, well, not Jews, but unless they were zealots, Jews, or in Romans, of course.  And then he was struck on the road to Damascus by the voice of Christ.  And it was like, hey, why are you killing all my friends? 
[00:38:30]  And he's like, oh, shit, I'm sorry.  And then he became, yeah, he flipped sides.  So anyway, like, Willem Dafoe, he's got a wife and he's got some kids that are walking  through, like, the town square.  And there's Paul talking about the risen Christ and, you know, the Christ they always talk  about in church and shit.  And he pulls them aside.  He's like, hey, man, not for nothing, but I am Jesus Christ.  You know, this guy you're talking about, I live.  I came off the cross.  I got married.  I got kids.  I don't know who you're talking about.  And Harry Dean Stanton is just like, well, not for nothing, but it doesn't matter. 
[00:39:00]  He's gone because my Jesus people would be willing to die for.  My Jesus people are happy to die for him.  He gives him peace and shit.  And who are you?  You're just a guy.  Walking around, a guy.  That's what I feel like.  Like, I feel like Wayne Gretzky means so much to me if I just met him and he turned out  to be just a human being.  Yeah.  I'd much rather just think of him in glowing terms.  The legend.  Yes.  Do you have anything signed by him?  His father this weekend gave me a shit ton of things.  Oh, wow.  So you got a Wayne Gretzky trophy?  I got a bunch of things, man. 
[00:39:30]  I don't think Wayne would miss it.  I know.  I could have.  I was looking around going, like, I wonder if I could take one of these.  Can you imagine?  That would be such bad for him.  Why didn't you just tell the dad you wanted to meet him?  That's because I don't like how you didn't hear me.  You should meet.  No, but you should rethink that.  I don't know, man.  They're usually nice.  People you want to meet are usually cool.  No, they're not.  I've always had great experiences.  I wanted to meet Chevy Chase, and guess what?  Oh, gee.  I could have told you that.  Anyone could have told you that.  You know what?  That Adolf H. was not quite the guy I thought he'd be.  I think MC Hammer might be on the Pix News today. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, because this dude dancing.  I think.  He's coming in studio.  He's a big Twitter guy.  He's got the pants on, too.  He tweets a lot, doesn't he?  He's a big Twitter guy.  I don't follow fucking MC Hammer.  Well, MC Hammer's going to be in today.  I follow you, man.  I see you update a lot.  I see all your things.  I go through stages, you know.  I see if there's a rush.  There'll be a rush of tweets.  Well, like we were on Jimmy Fallon last night, so I wanted to just like.  How was that?  I'm sorry I didn't see you.  I had a ball, man.  We had a great time.  And they shoot right here in town.  Yeah, yeah.  Right there.  Well, like you were saying, the old Johnny Carson studio when Johnny was in New York. 
[00:40:30]  That's what freaked me out.  Like, I was watching.  I'm sitting in there, and then we go into one of the green rooms, and there's a big poster  up there of Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon, and Nancy Sinatra sitting on the couch and everything.  And it was the old Johnny Carson studio when he was in New York, mega years ago.  And it's the same studio.  So I'm just kind of going, holy shit, man.  As a kid, when my parents were watching Johnny Carson, this was the studio where he did it  from.  And I remember that as a kid watching Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon. 
[00:41:00]  Isn't that fucking cool?  And then there you are years later.  Years later.  Never thought, you're walking out on that stage.  It's the same stage, same place.  It's like, fucking, that freaks you out sometimes.  It's the good life.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, that's amazing, dude.  You're looking at that, and you're going, like, my parents used to watch this shit, and  now I'm sitting in the same thing they used to fucking want.  Same freaking place.  I've had that moment a zillion times for the last two weeks.  It's like, every time I'm looking at the monitor, and I see Bruce Willis holding a gun, I'm 
[00:41:30]  just like, that's fucked up.  That's like, I've seen Bruce Willis hold a gun in many movies, and now it's one I'm  making.  It's your movie.  And now you can tell him to hold it different.  Yeah, I'm like, quit holding it like a pansy.  That's a gun, not a cock you're holding.  I'm totally using that one.  I fucking...  And when he glowers at me, I'm going to be like, Jimmy Norton said it.  He'll go, who?  And you'll go, yeah, I forgot.  I can never watch enough Die Hard, by the way. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, fucking yes.  It's never a movie you turn off.  He did it the other day, last night.  I don't know if he was authentic, or if he did it just to fuck around, but we were, there  was a shot where he has to go in and declare, like, you know, who he is, and he was saying  Brooklyn PD, and then somebody was like, he wouldn't say Brooklyn, he was just saying  NYPD.  At that point, I was like, Bruce, man, that means Jimmy Monroe is in the same force that John  McClane.  Like, that's...  And he even smiled and then walked away.  Because you see it in his face, he's just like, you fucking fanboy. 
[00:42:30]  You know, I don't want to work with a fucking fanboy.  By the way, you were so awesome when you killed Hans Gruber, you were right to do it.  But anyway, so he walks in, he walks into the shot, and he's supposed to just simply go  like, you know, excuse me, ma'am, NYPD, can we speak to you?  And it's rushing into the shot to start, give it some, like, motion to scare the woman and  her child who are coming up the way.  And he jumps in, and he's just like, John McClane, NYPD, ma'am, you gotta... 
[00:43:00]  And then all of a sudden, he goes, fuck, he steps out.  And then we were all like, ah!  John McClane, look!  And you sit there going, was it real?  Or did he just pour on a little bit of Bruce Willis syrup just for us all?  Which we needed at 3.30 in the morning, you know?  Everybody was just like, ah!  Bruce Willis showed up.  How much more you got to film?  Tons, dude.  We're on day...  We just wrapped day nine.  Today will be day 10.  And then we...  You guys shoot again today?  Yeah.  At 7.30 call time.  7.30 p.m.  Wow.  P.m.  P.m.  It's a nice shoot. 
[00:43:30]  So I get all day off and shit.  Get a little snooze time.  Get a little snooze.  But then that'll wrap the end...  That'll be the end of week two.  And then we still have...  I mean, let's see, day nine, and we still have 39 days to go.  So as of the end of today, we'll have 38 days to go.  So it's pretty dope, dude.  I don't want to jinx it, but...  That's awesome.  Performances across the board, like, Tracy's crushing it.  Tracy, you watch Tracy's footage, man, and you just see, like, a little ticker take in  the bottom right-hand corner with his price tag going up. 
[00:44:00]  This dude's going to be a big, big player.  Bruce is crushing it.  It's classic Bruce Willis.  It's the Bruce Willis that you want to see.  And he's doing comedy.  Yeah.  Like, serious comedy.  Like, when was the last time you saw that?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I mean, he's done, like...  He's been funny in movies, but, like, this is flat-out comedy.  We could see it in your face, Kevin.  Oh!  Sean William Scott shot this week.  We love that guy.  Motherfucker.  You gotta get him...  Killed it!  He was hysterical.  We gotta get him in here.  Oh, he loves doing the show, too.  Yeah, I talked to him when I first got to set last night. 
[00:44:30]  I was like, dude, when we're done here, I'm going O&A in the morning.  He's just like, oh, can I go with you?  I said, yeah.  But they broke him early, and then I guess he...  Yeah, we'll get him in here.  ...exhaustive.  But, yeah, he's around.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, um, he was...  He did...  Who else?  Adam Brody is in the movie from the OC.  That dude's a fucking genius.  He's really, really funny.  And Kevin Pollack, who's really fucking funny, and, like, and also, like, brings loads of  experience.  I was just watching him and Bruce Willis in that movie...  The whole nine yards.  The whole ten yards.  They know each other.  Yeah, they were also in another one where he's... 
[00:45:00]  Bruce Willis is a...  What is he, a cop?  There's a hostage situation at the house.  Kevin Pollack was the father at the house.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hostage or something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just watching that the other night.  Look at Bruce Willis, man.  Every movie, you're just like, he's fucking badass.  He's a badass.  Guillermo Diaz.  He plays our bad guy, and Guillermo Diaz is, um...  He was in, like, that Parker Posey movie years ago, Party Girl.  But, like, most people would notice him or know him from...  Did you ever watch Weeds?  Of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was the Mexican dealer. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he's great.  Oh, this guy's a fucking genius.  And I fought so hard to cast him because, like, I've always loved him.  He's always an interesting actor to watch his face, and he's always...  Like, you know, some people, you can tell how they're going to deliver a line.  Some lines that people read on the page, you're like, yeah, that's pretty much how I thought  I'd hear it.  And then you meet these actors who find a way to, like, deliver a line where you're like,  I never would have thought of delivering that way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's one of those cats where you're like, that's fucked up.  Why did you think of delivering it that way?  It's really interesting.  Yeah, because some directors, I guess, would look and go, like, that's not the way I saw 
[00:46:00]  it.  I don't care if you did it better.  It's not the way I saw it.  Yeah.  But you're just like, hey.  I'm like, well, the nice thing is because I didn't write the script.  I'm way more collaborative.  Oh, right, okay.  Because I can't sit there and arbitrarily say that I am the, you know, my opinion matters.  Yeah, exactly.  You can't fucking write it.  That's what I'm saying.  So I can never feel like that comfortable going like, like, I get it.  My job is to steer the ship.  But like, I'll defer to the writers all the time where I'm like, what did you see when  you wrote it in your head? 
[00:46:30]  Or if somebody has a good idea, I'm like, let's fucking try that shit.  Why not?  You know, as far as Hollywood bad guys go, I got to go back to Die Hard again.  What a great collection of bad guys Gruber had with him.  I mean, that whole, the one scene where it's like, we ran out of table.  Were the guys on the table?  Hey, pal.  And Bruce Willis just shoots him through the table all in his femoral arteries.  Just fucking destroyed him.  What a great 80s collection of bad guys in that movie, though. 
[00:47:00]  Very much so.  With his hair, fucking Goodenough there with his long fucking blonde locks.  We were just talking about him last night, Goodenough, because I forget who.  Oh, Sean William Scott going, let's get that guy in this movie.  Let's get him in there, man.  And Bruce goes, he passed, Sean.  Oh, he did.  Yeah, he died.  Yeah.  That was like, wasn't that a tragic, like, carbon monoxide thing or something?  Was it?  I thought it was like, dude got cancer.  No, I think.  Yeah, let's look it up.  It was like some odd thing.  Yeah, let's look it up for a happy fucking morning. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, way to bring things down.  We don't even need to look it up.  But there was also that Asian guy when he was at the candy counter.  What a great scene that was.  You know, the badass fucking guys.  Little touches like that, man, that make it very memorable.  Like, that's, when you think of movies, you don't really think about, like, the set pieces.  Yeah.  As much as you think about those little moments.  And that's what makes you go back.  Yeah, it's such a great scene.  I mean, this badass fucking, and you've seen that Asian guy as a bad guy in so many other movies.  And he sits there, he fucking gets his rifle, he's aiming it at the door, the guys are coming in, and he's at the candy counter. 
[00:48:00]  And you don't even realize that he's at that counter.  It's nothing until he glances down two times and then reaches in and grabs a candy bar.  It's just like, I'm a bad guy, I'm badass, I'm going to be a cul-de-sit, but that fucking Snickers bar looks great, man.  Yeah, it's those moments, man, that make that movie great.  What happened?  Sorry, there's a chair behind me.  Oh, hey.  I've got to ask Kevin, you're going to miss game seven tonight, my friend.  I'm going to be watching it on the set.  We found a way to hook it up through the monitors, so one of the monitors will have a picture. 
[00:48:30]  I mean, look, I'm kind of interested, but I'm not, neither of those guys are my team, so I can still direct.  I would say you would go Penguins.  I do go Pens.  Yeah, you got to go Pens.  And also, it's just like, to me, this is set up to be like a repeat of the 84 Oilers, dude, where they were beat last year by this team, and then they face the same team again this year, and then win.  And I predicted, I said Pens in game seven at the beginning, so we're at game seven, now we've got to take it to the Pens. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, I knew they'd put up a fight, man.  It was looking grim.  After these first two games, it was looking really grim.  It looked bad.  The kid wants it.  That little kid wants it.  You got Detroit listening today, too, though, so.  Well, I'm not saying that Detroit sucks.  I'm going to shoot a movie in Detroit, dude.  That hockey movie hit somebody, we're going to shoot in Detroit.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, I wonder if.  I just saved my ass right there.  I'm like, look, I may not be rooting for you guys for the cup, but we're coming there to make a movie.  You don't want them throwing octopuses at me.  Yeah, I don't want to get there and get a squid in the face.  Wayne Gretzky may enjoy acting. 
[00:49:30]  No, dude, you keep on.  He doesn't want to meet Gretzky.  I want to see Kevin meet his hero.  I don't know.  What if I meet him, I'm like, oh, Jimmy, he was a dick.  No, I don't think you would be.  I've heard good things about him.  Have you?  Yes.  But have you ever heard a bad thing?  No.  He's kind of fishy, isn't it?  No.  He's one of those guys who's just, he seems like a nice guy, and I've heard that he's like a really nice dude.  But don't you understand what he's saying?  Yes, but.  Sometimes you just don't, you know, you want to keep it where it's at.  He'll be after it over and he'll be happy he did it.  Jimmy is the exact opposite, though.  Jimmy wants to meet every hero he's ever had. 
[00:50:00]  But most experiences have been great.  Most have been great.  Not all.  A couple have been kind of douchey, but they've all been interesting.  De Niro wasn't a dick, though.  He said no for a picture, but he wasn't a dick.  But you were a dick.  Oh, fucking poor.  I'm talking about you being a dick.  He said no.  Jason Mewes tried to take a picture of Jack Nicholson once.  We went to this, like, fashion show.  And he goes, Mr. Nicholson, I'm a huge fan of you, and I loved you in Batman.  Can I take a picture of you?  And he goes, no.  He was blanked by Nicholson.  No, I was at an event, and De Niro was there. 
[00:50:30]  Jimmy had a douchey moment, though.  I wanted to get a picture with him, and it said no pictures of Billy Crystal Play premiere.  And I walked up behind De Niro, and he was standing there.  I just tapped his form, and I went, Bob?  Because I was hoping.  I swear to God, I was hoping that if I said Bob, he would think that we had met or talked on a prior occasion.  You were trying to deceive Bobby D?  I was.  And I'm like, God.  He lies for a living, dude.  How are you going to deceive that guy?  Well, my acting apparently wasn't up to skill.  I said, can I take a picture with you?  And he went in the hole.  He goes, I just want to see Billy, because if I take one, a lot of people will ask.  And I couldn't argue with him, because he was. 
[00:51:00]  Tell them no.  Yeah, exactly.  But he wasn't a dick.  He was like, you know, we shook hands.  He was okay.  Right.  Oh, wow.  That is really cool.  And that didn't put you off him at all?  No.  No, he wasn't.  Gene Simmons I had a weird run-in with, but afterwards, it all works out.  But I've heard Gretzky's great.  I met Gene Simmons once at the Golden Apple in Los Angeles, and he was nice enough.  But, man, I've never met anybody who was more into making money.  Oh, my God.  I thought I liked making money.  But I'm a nickel and dime artist. 
[00:51:30]  This guy.  He's a machine.  Oh, my God.  The dude, like, literally, we were just introduced by Bill Leibois, this dude who used to run Golden Apple, who died.  And he, within, no lie, dude, within three minutes, the dude had whipped out a notepad and showed me all these projects he was working on.  Jesus Christ.  And then he showed me, he's like, you know what's really going to make me rich?  And I was like, no, tell me.  I assumed you were.  And he flips the page.  I mean, you're fucking Gene Simmons. 
[00:52:00]  He flipped the page, and there was a picture of a dollar sign.  And I was like, I didn't know what he was trying to say.  Like, I was like, that's going to make you rich?  Money?  Is this a game of some sort?  What kind of game is being played?  He then proceeded to tell me that he had trademarked the dollar sign on a bag.  On a bag, like in Monopoly.  Yes.  And then he was, Parker Brothers, whoever makes that game, was eventually going to owe him money.  He's fucking crazy. 
[00:52:30]  I was just like, dude, we just met.  Yeah, why are you telling me that?  Why are you telling me your harebrained scheme?  When he said, I'm going to show you how to make money, did you think he was going to take his wig off and cook vegetables in it and say, the wok?  The Gene Simmons wok.  That's what it is.  Well, you want to go home, don't you, Kevin?  I heard you just want to stop by for half an hour.  That dude had a lot of sex, didn't he?  Oh, it's all he did was fucking stop by.  He didn't smoke, didn't drink.  He never fucking around.  Did you ever hear that NPR interview he did?  No.  Really? 
[00:53:00]  No.  Not a good one.  It's spellbinding.  He gets on with Terry Gross for, what is it, Fresh Air or something like that?  And he's the most hostile, standoffish fucking guest on the planet where he's just, and he keeps coming at her for being an NPR broadcaster.  He's like, well, you know, I don't know if that's how they do it here.  It's NPR.  You know, coming, like, she's like off snobby.  Well, he's a conservative guy.  He's a much more conservative guy.  Like, when you talk about the Middle East, and he probably, NPR has a very liberal reputation. 
[00:53:30]  He probably was annoyed about that.  At one point, I can't remember if he walks off or not, but the interview is cut short because he's so standoffish and hostile with Terry Gross.  It's kind of like, you know, she'd be like, so why are you into this?  And he'd be like, why are you into it?  That kind of thing.  Really?  But look it up, man.  It's totally worth a listen.  Fuck him.  That's what I would say.  It's not happy with Gene Simmons.  Gene Simmons was just trying to fuck my chick.  At the time.  When?  About a year ago.  He knew it was my chick, and then he came right from there because she was working at double. 
[00:54:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Is he married?  Channel 11.  They have that open marriage thing.  They have a weird, open fucking relationship.  One of those open relationships.  Him and Shannon Tweed?  Shannon Tweed, yeah.  Is she allowed to have sex with other people?  Apparently not.  I think it's open on his side.  We kind of asked that, yeah.  Yeah.  So she can't have sex with other people, but he can?  Yeah, yeah.  And for Gene, the way he explains it, it's totally fine.  How do you hook that up?  I don't know.  Kiss money.  But he's been, yeah.  You think so?  Yes.  He holds up the dollars.  I've trademarked wives that only can fuck you, and you can fuck everybody else. 
[00:54:30]  Trademarked.  Trademarked.  Right.  Him and his dollar sign.  Yeah, so he was trying to, like, bang my chick at the time.  Right.  And he knew it was my girl.  And then he comes over here to do our show.  Right.  And he, like, kind of, he was like, yeah, I was over there to Channel 11 over there.  And I was like, oh, yeah, wow.  A girl over there.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know.  And then he wasn't saying anything about it.  And then he was like, yeah, well, maybe tonight I'll just fuck your girlfriend.  I was like, oh, I'm laughing, like, oh, boy, like, he didn't know who it was or something.  Like, why would he say? 
[00:55:00]  And coincidentally, he had just done an interview over there and everything.  But he knew.  And he was, like, fucking with me.  Really?  Disrespecting me right there, live, on my show.  So, since then, fuck Gene Simmons.  He's fucking clown shoes.  He's dead.  You're dead.  He's dead to you.  If I may quote you.  Clown shoes.  Fucking clown shoes.  Yeah, but then you watch, like, Kiss Me to the Phantom.  And you're like, all right, well, at least there was good movies.  That's a good movie.  So you look at that comic and you're like, I'm reading a comic that was printed with  their blood.  Their blood, man. 
[00:55:30]  I saw those photos when I was a boy.  I had the 12-inch dolls.  Yeah.  There's always a lot of money if you have a set of four.  They are.  If you got a mint in the box.  Yeah, I don't have that.  I got the Paul all loose.  Do you?  Yeah.  I had a couple of them.  I had Gene and Paul.  I never got Peter and Ace.  I was never a big Kiss guy.  No.  My cousin was a huge Kiss guy.  My friend Walter Flanagan's a huge Kiss guy.  I think you gotta be a little fucking crazy.  But, you know, I did like, I loved, you know, Kiss Meets the Phantom in the Park and I had 
[00:56:00]  the comic book.  Who wouldn't love that?  Because we were watching clips of it the other day and Gene with his growl and the  great acting.  Easy, easy, Catman.  Easy, Catman.  Oh, shut up.  What a douchey move.  There's a funny scene where Gene is breaking apart a concession stand.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  And, uh.  One take.  And he, but he obviously walks through and kind of trip, like, trip walks through the  end of it.  He falls.  Trip falls.  Yeah.  He falls through.  Please show Kevin that.  Because they only obviously had one of these to break up. 
[00:56:30]  And they said break it apart.  You can't, you have to watch it, but you can see that he trips over something.  And it doesn't, he doesn't fall, but it doesn't look good.  Yeah, it's made of styrofoam.  And so they couldn't put it back together or anything.  They had one.  So he's bashing through it and he trips.  And then you could tell he fell.  Well, they just left it in the film.  It's fantastic.  It's amazing.  A man of his stature might fall and trip.  Yeah, he would have trouble walking through concession stands that weren't actually made  of wood.  All right, let's see.  Here it is.  This is the worst kind of radio. 
[00:57:00]  The kind of radio when you watch TV.  When you're watching.  On the radio.  But we do it so much now that people, you know.  We told people what it is.  That's maybe the time they used to go to the bathroom or something like that.  Take a little breather.  It's like the drum solo.  All right, we're just kind of fast forwarding through.  Trying to find it.  And now when you explain as we're trying to look, it's even worse.  But people, at least in this.  Oh, Gene's breaking through a wall.  I forgot about that.  He broke through walls.  And that's Kehoe from fucking 48 Hours.  He's one of the cops.  Yeah.  It's good music at least.  Hey, quick. 
[00:57:30]  This is Gene.  I'm at Station 48.  He gets a backup.  Yeah.  Well, he might be the demon robot.  Don't you get it, pigs?  Oh, he's spitting fire.  Wow.  Great special effects.  Yeah, the fire's coming out of his mouth.  It looks like really fire.  That's great.  He used to do that on stage the other day.  He still does, yeah?  Look at the stalking.  He's stalking the police.  Why aren't they shooting him?  I don't think they have guns.  Are they real cops or are they just a fan of the park cops?  A fan of the park cops?  They got no guns?  Yeah, that's right.  They're like guards. 
[00:58:00]  It's so weird.  Even now, even though I know what Gene Simmons looks like, I can't see Gene Simmons under that  makeup.  No.  Still to this day.  You can't picture that fucking guy talking about money and finance.  Oh, shit.  He's throwing the fucking cops around.  This is assaulting an officer.  Yeah.  Why won't these cops?  I don't know.  They're all just staring at the demon.  He's doing slow motion.  Listen to this music.  It's just...  It's bionic man stuff.  It's every bad episode of Chips. 
[00:58:30]  How about Kiss music?  Here he goes to the stand.  This is it right here.  A little growl.  And then watch.  Look at this thing.  It's just awful.  Here he goes.  Whoops!  He toppled a bit.  Oh, and that was...  And then they go to commercials.  Yeah, yeah.  They had to go to that.  So as a little kid, you were like, oh my god.  Gene destroyed a candy counter!  That's fucking great, man.  I love that stupid movie. 
[00:59:00]  I probably watched that 30...  My goal is to get to Anthony's house and watch it on his 11-foot screen.  We have to watch that.  He ate her.  What else?  Were you a big fan of...  Do you remember...  What was the other TV movie?  With the little fuckers that live under the steps?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was...  I think it was called Little Fuckers Under the Steps.  No, it wasn't called...  Well, watch Craven did a film like that.  The People Under the Stairs is actually a movie movie.  It was...  It's not Let's Scare Jessica to Death, because that's kind of boring.  It's...  Fuck, what is it?  It doesn't sound familiar. 
[00:59:30]  Damn it.  It's the little, like, demon midget puppets that are kind of miniature, and they...  Fuck, and they're always, like, whispering.  Like, this chick is driven insane, because she hears them whispering from under...  Behind the radiators.  And they're like...  Oh, shit.  And they show them...  It's fucking creepy as fuck.  That was...  I'm spacing on it, because I haven't slept in almost 24 hours.  I'm sure Daniel will find it.  Does anybody...  We have plenty of people listening.  Somebody knows.  I thought at first you were talking about Trilogy of Terror with the...  With the Zuni fetish doll.  Have you seen they make a Zuni fetish doll? 
[01:00:00]  We got them at the store.  It's fucking insane looking.  Yeah, that was...  God, what is that movie called, man?  Yeah, no one has it yet.  They're remaking it now, too, I heard.  Guillermo del Toro is remaking it.  I saw a clip last...  I was watching Denzel on Letterman, and he was actually a very entertaining guest on Letterman.  It was a really good interview.  Yeah.  And they showed a clip of the...  Of course, the taking of Pelham 123 needed to be remade, thanks to CGI.  Yeah.  You know, fucking Matthau and Robert Stroud, they didn't do a good job.  The first one, you might as well throw Travolta in there. 
[01:00:30]  And they showed a clip of the back-and-forth banter, and they showed Travolta being crazy,  like, as the hostage taker.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Didn't like it, Jimmy?  How could you?  Fucking horrible.  That one hurt.  It was awful.  Don't be afraid of the dark.  The Bad News Bears remake hurt me.  Oh, of course.  That was the one that really hurt.  I took that person.  Another one that I guess Matthau wasn't good enough in.  What is it?  Granted, he's a homely man, but why would you remake everything the guy ever did? 
[01:01:00]  He was great.  This is the name of that movie.  I yelled out, don't be afraid of the dark.  That is it.  Don't be afraid of the dark.  Who's it?  Click for that.  I don't remember it.  Who was in that?  I don't know.  Who was the big star?  She wasn't going to be a big star.  Yeah.  He doesn't get that picture.  I got to tell you, for a TV movie, this is still one of the most unsettling films I've ever  seen in my life.  You know, they used to make really good TV movies back in the day.  Now it's just lifetime exclusives.  This one works, man.  Did you ever see a scary movie called Crowhaven Farm?  No.  God damn it.  He's my last home.  Kim Darby was in that. 
[01:01:30]  Who's that?  What?  That's fucking, she was in Star Trek episode of the, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  She played the little fucking girl that kind of fell in love with Kirk.  This flick, so fucking, so spooky.  Go to YouTube and enter Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.  God damn.  I've never heard of anybody in that movie.  Kim, how do you not know Kim Darby?  How do you?  She was also in, um, what was that, that movie, uh, with the ski thing in the 80s?  It was always a ski thing in the 80s, though. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, God, how do I not remember a star of that magnitude?  The chick in the movie about the ski thing in the 80s?  She was, she played the mother of.  The ski thing in the 80s?  What are you talking about?  Uh, uh, Wiener.  What was his name?  It's a Lorimar production, man.  Oh, damn, look at that.  Skip on.  Well, once it loads up, skip on down.  They show them, they show up like, they don't fucking bury the lead, man.  It's like, come up music.  There's this house that she winds up living in. 
[01:02:30]  Damn, that's ominous.  And the dude who, there she is, Kim Darby.  And the dude who played on My Three Sons, it was Uncle Charlie.  Oh, yeah.  He's in this.  And, uh, he's the dude that's, uh, the, like, the grounds of Kim Darby.  You better get someone to help you.  And he's just like, man, don't ever open that thing under the stairs.  And she's like, how about that old man?  And he's like, you'll see.  It's not really the dialogue.  See, that's Kim Darby.  And she, she plays a nervous wreck the whole picture.  She's always like, I'm hearing things.  And they're like, you're crazy.  Jeez, who's that guy?  Look at that great fucking Burt Reynolds from Boogie Nights. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, that's, see, down, they go in the basement.  He's the home decorator.  And right there, in the base, it's not the stairs.  It's the base of the chimney that's sealed up.  Yeah, yeah.  And in the chimney, these little things fucking have been trapped for.  What, they just let him out?  50 years.  Because evil, Jimmy, evil.  So move somewhere else.  Well, they don't know yet.  Those little puppet people, bitch.  Uncle Charlie won't be honest with her.  He just tells her, like, don't ever open it.  And she's like, why?  He's like, just, I can't tell you.  Don't do it.  Why would you ever buy the house after that? 
[01:03:30]  You know what, a movie about people just moving, Jimmy?  Yes.  They just move.  Why don't they just move?  See, you know her, right?  Why would you buy a house where they say, don't ever open that?  But what did she hear of her?  She was in a fuckload of movies.  Did she hear something?  Damn.  She heard this would be a good idea to make this movie.  I applaud Kim Darby for making this movie.  This movie stuck with me for 30 fucking, 33 years, I'd say, at this point.  There's Uncle Charlie.  There's Uncle Charlie.  And he's like, don't fucking go in that house. 
[01:04:00]  What are you doing?  Why are you leaving it alone?  Yes.  I used to molest my three nephews in that.  Under there, you'll find bones and burned underwear.  By the way, Timothy Hutton's father.  Get out of here.  This guy?  Yeah.  Is that Timothy Hutton?  I think it's Timothy Hutton's grandfather.  John Hutton.  I thought his dad looked down.  I thought his dad was dead.  I think he is dead, by the way.  Oh, man.  Get to the little creatures.  I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  This has kind of an ominous or creepy fucking vibe to it. 
[01:04:30]  Some of these movies just had a really scary kind of background feel to them.  It's crazy, dude, how well this movie still holds up.  You can't find it.  It's not on VHS, not on DVD.  Apparently, you can watch it here on YouTube.  Sure.  Thank God for YouTube.  You can watch anything.  See?  And she finds this thing's been walled up.  There's bricks and...  Ooh.  You're happy, too.  What is she doing?  She's trying to get under there, man.  She wants to know what's...  Why is this all brick?  I know.  Jesus.  She's the type that'll go through your BlackBerry, your email. 
[01:05:00]  What a fucking nosy bitch.  God damn, Jim.  She's got her head in the chimney.  Yeah, yeah.  Now she's...  Here we go.  Why don't the monsters run out now?  What the fuck?  You got to build it up.  Oh.  Zip ahead again.  Okay, Sally.  Please.  Uh-oh.  Problem.  Keep going.  That's why I'm not a good movie maker, because I would just have the monsters run out eight  minutes into the movie and leave.  Ooh.  Yeah, Jim Hutton is Timothy Hutton's dad.  And he looks just like...  Oh, it's him.  That young guy.  I thought you were talking about...  I thought you were talking about... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, this guy.  This is his dad.  He really...  He walks like him, too.  Holy shit.  That's bizarre.  That's his dad.  You just married me because I'm the perfect hostess.  No.  Because you're a wreck.  Exactly.  Could you imagine what family dinners were like?  He's like, uh...  I was in Ordinary People.  Yeah.  He's like, I was in Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.  A Laura Marr production.  Laura Marr.  Okay, so once they zoom in on Doris, we're going to start hearing those creepy voices and  shit.  Yeah.  Oh, it's very much that.  Very creepy. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  See?  Look.  See the lights and the little feet and shit?  Now they're going to have to push the key out.  Oh, the key's being pushed out of the keyhole.  And now they can grab the key with their little hands.  Damn, yo.  Oh, they put it under the thing.  Slot it back under.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's right.  They were able to get the key that way.  So they can open it from the other side.  That old gag.  And enter our world.  Oh, shit.  They must be pretty tall.  They can get the doorknob.  There are a few of them.  I think they stand on each other's heads.  Yeah, they stand on each other's shoulders.  Little creepy shoulders.  Zip down again.  Okay, there you go. 
[01:06:30]  Whenever you see shots like this, you're about to see the creatures.  Like, they built large versions of miniature corners in the kitchen.  And that's when they shuffle out.  Well, it could be, but I kind of...  You know what's great?  And I knew it because I just went here.  The director of this did everything.  Star Trek, Night Gallery.  All kinds of these old TV shows. 
[01:07:00]  Next Step Beyond, Police Woman.  He directed five Police Woman episodes.  Hey, Danny, go back a little bit, I think, because you can hear.  Obviously, under the bed, she heard it.  Let's hear what they said.  Wonder Woman.  Oh, they knocked an ashtray over.  Oh, damn, yo.  She's stepping through glass with her bare feet.  I'm looking for a Columbo.  I know he's had to have directed a few Columbos.  Go to that next clip.  It looks just like it.  Timothy Hutton's father's drying his face, wondering what it's like to win an Oscar your 
[01:07:30]  first time out and then do nothing of value for 20 years.  So you never get up.  Why is she investigating?  Now you hear him whispering.  Still, when this movie...  1973, they let him sleep in the same bed.  Wow.  Thus insinuating that they may indeed have fucked.  I love Lucy was always weird.  They always had to bed the whole...  Because Bessie liked to fuck her and to shitter.  And he would always...  That was why they did that. 
[01:08:00]  And he liked to stand in between the beds and then wipe his dirty dick on her pillow.  That was why they did that, which I thought was rather racy for the time.  Yes.  Of course it was.  Yes.  And now it all makes sense.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Let's get to the monsters.  Oh, that woman.  Yeah, you seen her...  Once again, like, it's shocking how they keep your interest, considering there's this  whole other psychodrama going on in her real life.  Who is this dyke?  She has great hair.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  She does look little...  Holy shit, she has fucking cool hair.  She has, like, really...  That's a man's cut.  Yes.  Look at that new old car.  There's Uncle Charlie, and he's walling the shit up again.  Yeah.  Putting mirrors in his shoes.  He's about to lecture.  Let's hear the lecture.  You'd be better off leaving it alone.  Mr. Harris, you're as bad as I am.  Letting your imagination run away with you.  Why, has something happened?  No.  What would happen?  Anyway, you're quite right about the fireplace. 
[01:09:00]  My husband and I both looked at it, and it would be impossible to...  I mean, I remember this being a lot better.  Did anyone direct this, or are they just left to their own devices?  No, I like this, though.  Sometimes you just let the actors talk for a while, and then y'all cut about nothing.  I'm stubborn and curious.  And all of Charlie's wearing the same get-up Ralph Cramden did when he was the super in  the building for a day.  He's got that Martin Paints cap on.  Oh, Martin.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  They're pulling her dress, dude. 
[01:09:30]  And they're saying, we want you.  What do you guys want?  They want her.  They're pulling her dress going, we want you.  We want you.  Oh, no.  Go talk to Uncle Charlie.  Yeah, he'll tell you what the...  Who was tugging on you?  It wasn't Ernie, the big cocked one, wasn't it?  I can't believe we're watching this movie on the radio.  Why not?  We've got to go down.  Zip down.  Listen, we've got to see the fucking monster. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, that's all we're looking for.  Do you think Uncle Charlie would just torture Fred McMurray with Kane?  Here we go, listen.  They're talking.  They're talking to her.  That's where a commercial was.  There was a commercial.  Now they're back.  Where are the monsters?  Oh, man.  ABC.  Mystery.  Movie.  Somebody at Lorimar fucked up. 
[01:10:30]  And didn't do notes on this, man.  Yeah.  Because any fucking exec worth their salt would be like,  you've got to show the fucking creatures soon, man.  Sooner than this.  I think we're an hour in.  They might have shown them at one point.  Is this a miniseries?  Was this the roots of its day?  Wait, go back.  I think you missed one.  What is that?  Oh, no.  It's a zoom in on that.  Yeah, you've got to have a full shot.  Yeah, just when you think something interesting is happening,  it's like, ooh, they zoomed in on the wall.  We're at the end of this clip, too.  We've got to go to part four.  There's Uncle Charlie smelling her period panties by the fucking fireplace. 
[01:11:00]  It's just creepy.  We're up to part four.  They're having a party.  How would you...  That's good shadowing, like Citizen Kane.  The guy that wrote this wrote like eight episodes of The Waltons, Family, Seven Heavens.  Was it based on any source material, like a book or something?  He wrote the episode of The Waltons where Grandpa was haunted by the little creatures  and then burned the house down.  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, he wrote like seven episodes.  This guy stinks on ice. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, he's the worst.  This guy's a hunk of shit with feet.  Oh, damn, man.  Oh, for the love of God.  No, I think he just wrote this fucking thing.  I'm bringing this show to a screeching halt, man.  No, it's great.  No.  No.  Come on.  This is our show.  What's better than looking at an old 70s movie?  With Kevin.  Come on.  Look, they're panting him on.  It's not delivering yet.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Now we're in the kitchen.  Now we're in the shitter.  In the bathroom.  Oh, in the bathroom.  She's in the shower.  She's turtling, but the place is haunted.  She doesn't know what to do.  There she goes picking a straight razor up off the floor. 
[01:12:00]  That can't be good.  Oh, maybe they're going to be in the cabinet.  Oh, no.  Why put it back on the floor?  As long as they're not a toilet.  Oh, be in the cabinet.  Please be in the cabinet.  Come on, come on.  Please be in the cabinet.  Come on.  Please be in the cabinet.  That's what the whole audience is saying.  Open that motherfucking cabinet.  Why don't you turn the lights out?  There's a little arm.  And look, they're coming out.  Here they are.  They come out.  Oh, damn.  Oh, the monster.  Oh, stop. 
[01:12:30]  Wow, is that scary?  Come on, dude.  When you're like eight years old, you saw that.  That was scary shit.  You're like, oh, kill me now.  That was scary shit.  So she turned the lights off to get them out.  Yeah.  And then they came out and saw it and they ran back in like little fucking homos.  What's wrong with these things?  Why don't you man up, you monsters?  They looked very old Twilight Zone-ish.  Yes.  Night Gallery-ish.  I mean, don't be surprised if they used the same fucking costumes.  Yeah.  With a minor alteration.  And now she's looking on the towel, the linen thing, but they're gone.  I must be crazy. 
[01:13:00]  Where do they hide?  Where do they go?  They were in the walls, man.  They're like rats.  She's like, maybe if I turn the light off again.  They have little icky hands.  Can I outthink these bastards?  Now, this is what I told you before.  Some things are better left as they are.  See?  Uncle Charlie with the Pet Sematary-like refrain of sometimes dead is better.  I didn't see the movie Pet Sematary, but I did read the book.  It was very frightening.  Very frightening. 
[01:13:30]  Very frightening book.  Damn.  Man, talk about setting a tone, right?  Yeah.  Boy.  I mean, come on.  Too much tone.  How annoying is she?  She's been scared, and she still hasn't been shaved.  It's like the end, the last one.  Now we're on part five or six.  God damn.  Oh, yeah.  They're dragging her?  Yeah, they're dragging her through the kitchen.  Come on.  That's so terrifying.  I'm knocked out.  How many are there?  What did they knock her out with?  I think there's three. 
[01:14:00]  They're strong.  That's like us dragging a tractor trailer.  That's like us.  See, look at them.  They got ropes on her, and they're all pulling.  What do they want to do with her?  They want her.  They want her.  They want her in the thing with them.  Their evilness.  They're going to bring her into the chimney.  Oh, that'd be claustrophobic.  Look at that.  That's a pretty hot shot.  That is a high-riding spirit.  Yeah.  She didn't show anything.  She's a very girl-next-star-ish thing back then.  It was kind of erotically charged that moment.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  They drugged her drink, I'm going to guess. 
[01:14:30]  Look at that.  Oh, right.  I think they did.  One key light correctly placed.  Yeah, you're getting fucking bushed.  You can kind of see it on underwear.  Oh, right.  She took the camera with a flash.  With a fucking Instamatic with flash cubes.  And look, they go right back to work.  Yeah.  She's got to keep doing it.  Don't.  Look, she's going, don't.  Oh.  See, they're trying to drag her to that hole.  She's only got four flashes, though, with that flash cube.  That's an Instamatic.  I know those.  Alex.  Alex, help. 
[01:15:00]  Nah.  Just pick them up and throw them.  They're fucking an inch tall, you dummy.  Fucking bite their little demon heads off.  They hide in the toilet?  These things suck.  How are you afraid of these?  Step on them.  They're very phallic, aren't they?  Yes.  They're like little cock heads dragging her down.  Hey, look.  He's looking for the key.  Break the window, asshole.  Your wife's being taken by demons.  He's listening.  Yeah, there he goes.  Oh, you're too late, buddy.  No.  No.  No.  She's done. 
[01:15:30]  She's done for.  That was good, man.  Take it from a pro.  That was a good performance.  I bought it.  Thank you, sir.  She disappeared like his career.  Where'd they take the bitch?  They took her into the chimney.  He just drops the flashback.  And listen.  Listen.  I see she became part of there. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  But do they show the pictures?  No.  So he can see the demons?  That's what I thought they were going to do.  He's like, what happened to her?  Set us free of death.  All the time.  Set us free.  Set us free.  They want to be set free.  Set us free in the world.  Free into you.  They want to be free in the world.  But they were free.  Yeah, they were.  They went back in the chimney.  They can't get out of the house for some reason.  Set us free. 
[01:16:30]  Ah!  I mean, that's like a two-minute shot.  Wow.  And then credits.  They really ended a movie quickly back in the old days, didn't they?  As soon as it was over.  The end.  You didn't mean to have motherfuckers.  You didn't fuck around.  By the way, the writer, also the demon voice.  Get out of here.  No shit.  Who was it?  Babe Ruth?  Have it in there.  The whisperer.  The spook whisperer?  It was the writer.  I guess, you know.  What are they going to do?  Don't touch it.  I won't.  I won't. 
[01:17:00]  I had a name, though.  We should take a break.  We've been at it in about an hour and a half.  Can I shout?  You know what?  I got to go to sleep.  I figured.  Let's shout out Carnegie Hall one more time.  Dude, we're all excited.  Everybody.  Please go buy a ticket now.  There's only 500 left.  Let's sell this bitch out, please.  Next Wednesday, 8 o'clock, June 17th.  You can get them.  Look.  212-247-7800.  Or go to carnegiehall.org.  Or just go to Kevin's site.  Viewaskew.com.  It's very easy to get.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Absolutely.  Or hit me up on.  Blow me up on Twitter.  That Kevin Smith.  All one word.  I'm almost at 700K.  God damn.  How did that happen?  Because I tweet like a motherfucker, man.  You blew up.  You blew up.  You blew up.  I tweet.  I've been training for this Twitter and stuff my whole life with the website.  The Godfather's on TV right there.  But wait.  Even if you Twitter a lot, how does that get more people into it?  Because the quality of your tweets, people.  It's not the volume.  It's the quality.  If you get some good shit out there.  People go like, he writes funny shit.  And then they start showing up. 
[01:18:00]  And then they show it to other people, hopefully.  I'm fascinated with this movie now and the cast and everything.  You should remake it, Kevin.  Which one?  Yeah.  The movie we just watched.  It's being remade.  Guillermo del Toro's doing it.  One of the.  That's the guy you want.  That dude's a master at shit like that.  You don't want me.  I'd be like.  The creatures would be like, suck our dicks.  Look at our wieners.  I want to shit your mouth.  Shit like that.  Where people are like, that goes far away from the original premise. 
[01:18:30]  I'm like, what?  That's not scary to you?  Little dudes want shit in your mouth.  They're standing on our nose, jerking off in our eyes.  Should we blind it?  It's terrifying.  One of the creatures, by the way, was Lucifer in Battlestar Galactica.  Get out of here.  Also Tweaky in Buck Rogers.  Yuck.  He was also an Ewok in Return of the Jedi.  A little fella, then.  So this motherfucker, and he was the visitor in Dukes of Hazzard.  Okay.  What's his name?  Dink in Spaceballs.  What's his name?  This guy's name is, where's his fucking name? 
[01:19:00]  Felix Silla.  Oh, Felix Silla.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  This guy had a fucking illustrious little career.  Isn't it weird?  And yet he's not a household name, yet you know all of those performances.  All those movies, of course.  H.R.  Puffin stuff.  No.  He was polka-dotted horse.  Did you guys, did anybody go see Land of the Lost, speaking of Sid and Marty Kroff?  Oh.  I think it's supposed to be a very good film.  I didn't see it.  It is?  No.  I didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  What was the other one that came out?  Hangover?  Anyone see Hangover?  I loved it.  You saw it? 
[01:19:30]  It was good?  I liked it a lot.  Well written.  Made a lot of money, man.  Well written.  That was good for us, too, because it was an R-rated comedy, and we're an R-rated comedy.  Ah.  Yeah.  Doing very well.  Coming back, the R-rated comedies.  I just saw-  They should all be R-rated.  I just saw Porky's the other day.  I know, but the problem is, a PG-13 will always make more money.  Always.  Because you're hitting people that you're not going to hit with an R.  I saw, it made me fucking howl.  I saw Observe and Report.  Mm-hmm.  It made, the dialogue in that was brutal.  I fucking laughed.  I howled in the theater, and of course it didn't make money. 
[01:20:00]  I'm a very bad bravander.  Whatever I find funny, the general public will not enjoy it.  It was a better movie, it was a better movie than Mall Cop, and this movie didn't do shit.  It just appeals, the Mall Cop appeals to brother.  It's amazing.  Mall Cop goes to, you know, a nine-year-old girl can enjoy it as much as a 70-year-old woman  who likes that dude from King of Queens.  But we were talking about the movie, I finally put it in, I'm a half hour, 40 minutes in,  not one laugh.  I didn't even know where I was supposed to laugh.  It was one of those things, like, someone tell me where the laugh is.  Like, I saw Twilight, dude. 
[01:20:30]  Yep.  I mean, come on.  What is that?  It was, Twilight is the vampire, the kid's vampire movie that all the little girls love.  Yeah, they love it.  With, what's his name, Rob Pattinson, the kid with the goth look and the hair.  You know who I'm talking about.  You've seen a picture.  Don't be coy.  I honestly don't.  You don't?  I probably just focused on his young body.  I wish I was that nubile.  Yeah, I don't know who he is.  This movie, you know, it's based on the books about vampire kids and a chick named Bella  and a dude named Edward and Team Edward.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  Those fucking books are on the time's bestseller list. 
[01:21:00]  Yes, this one.  No, here, that's it.  Yes, I am familiar.  So they made a movie that came out a little while ago, like, and it made a shit ton of  money.  Yeah.  It came out, like, November, December or something like that.  It's the new generation's Buffy the Vampire.  Oh, my God.  They're all over it.  And then the trailer for the new one came.  Yeah, this shit, right?  How is the movie?  Um, I found it as impenetrable as an Israeli film.  It was just like, this is not for me.  Like, this is, I am not the audience at all.  Just as you were not the Paul Blart audience, I'm just like, it's well made and I could see 
[01:21:30]  that everyone tried their hardest, but, like, this material is way over my head or under  my level of interest or something.  Best Dracula ever.  For my money?  Yeah.  Um, I'd go with, uh...  Frank Langella?  No, man.  I'd go with, um, um, the dude who played, uh, Bela Lugosi in the, in the, um, Ed Wood  movie that Tim Burton did.  Yes.  What's his name?  Michael Landon, London? 
[01:22:00]  No, no, he was the other thing.  Martin Landau.  Martin Landau, thank you.  Great pull, man.  Well done.  Martin Landau.  No one gives two fucks for Bela.  That was great.  That was great.  But that's technically, he played, that's a guy who played a vampire.  Yeah, but I mean, like, scary.  Straight up and up?  Scary.  Dude, I almost gotta go right back to the fuckin' original Nosferatu.  That fuckin'...  He was heredic.  That old school with the shadow on the wall.  Max Schreck, man.  Holy...  Max Schreck, you know.  Man.  Goddamn.  That's some scary-ass shit.  I'd take Christopher Lee. 
[01:22:30]  You'd go Christopher Lee?  Oh, yeah.  I would take him over anybody.  He frightened you?  Huh?  He frightened you?  He was just ominous.  Yeah, and then 68, 69 Hammer Films.  Not Gary Oldman?  He was great.  He was great.  He was pretty amazing.  Big puppy head.  But he wasn't scary.  Just that fuckin' laugh where he's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  And he had that weird clapping of the hands.  He's all boning.  He licks the razor.  I mean, he was...  Oh, that was so sweet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that one shot where he's walking across the ceiling?  He was horrendous.  Yeah.  But I mean, the Hammer Films.  He's got some great fuckin' role.  That goddamn professional when he's in that.  I want everyone.  What do you mean? 
[01:23:00]  Everyone!  Everyone!  And then he does that, where he snaps that shit and bites it and twists his neck.  The pill.  It's fuckin' fantastic.  But then he's the fuckin' white dreadlock guy in True Romance.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd play, and he plays Oswald in JFK.  Yeah.  He can play anybody.  He plays Oswald, too, yeah.  Anybody!  Anybody!  Yeah, he is good, man.  I like when they yell.  Yeah!  Look, but don't touch!  Touch, but don't taste! 
[01:23:30]  All right, we got it, Pacino.  Over the top performance.  That was excellent.  Thank you.  That was excellent.  We like...  Not only did you do Pacino, but you did Pacino from The Devil's Advocate.  You didn't go for the obvious Pacino, Scarface.  You went for fuckin' wow.  Anthony does old-school Pacino, too, though.  Let me hear the old-school.  The one where he talks kinda quiet.  Oh, my God, I forgot about that Pacino.  Yeah, remember that Pacino?  Yeah, that's Dog Day Afternoon Pacino.  Yeah.  My father's a very important man.  Before he actually gets, like, mean with his wife.  What's her name? 
[01:24:00]  Angie!  No.  Kay?  No!  Kay, yeah.  When Kay and her sit at the table, he's still in uniform.  You know, at the party.  Yeah.  When he says, that's not me, Kay.  That's my family.  That's not me, Kay.  Yeah, that's my family.  It's not me.  That's Luca Brasi.  Now!  Now he's like this!  Yeah!  You're not quite Rich Little, but you are Danny Gans-ish.  Thank you.  Let's hope so.  Yeah!  Fuck it! 
[01:24:30]  No, Pacino's greatest moment is the riveting film he just did with De Niro.  Righteous Kill.  Righteous Kill.  Oh, was that, the dialogue was so good.  At the end, when he dies, Pacino dies in this one.  And there's such a moving experience between the partners, because his final line to De Niro  is, continued success.  And then he dies, and the camera pulls back, and you see his little lifts on his shoes.  I hope he's in this fucking remake of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.  It's just him behind the radiator.  He still has to wear that suit. 
[01:25:00]  I got a big wig!  Did you ever see or work with or anything, Carradine?  David Carradine?  No.  I encountered him once in real life.  You did?  Wow.  No clue that he was into that kind of movie?  No idea, but when I, you know, I love those Kill Bill movies.  I thought his performance was sublime.  I'm like, this dude is going to light up like a rocket.  I mean, he's back.  I met him once at a screening, and he was not there. 
[01:25:30]  No, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  Like, in such a dramatic way, where I was like, wow, man, like that.  How long after Kill Bill was it?  I would say, not even a full year.  Wow.  I guess Tarantino was able to, like, kind of get something out of it.  I mean, it made me, my respect for Quentin, like, jumped a hundredfold.  And I always respected Quentin, but I was like, holy crap.  Oh, look at those little lifts.  Oh, shit.  Is that from Frankenstein?  I can't see.  Whose shoes are those?  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Those are lifts?  Yeah.  Those are lifts?  Look at them.  He's walking on the moon.  Either Pacino just landed on the moon, or he's got lifts. 
[01:26:00]  Wait, do these look like lifts?  I mean, don't we all have a basic shoe?  No, we don't.  No, look at your shoes have regular soles.  Yeah.  And this goes up, so it gives you a little bit?  Of course.  Look at them.  It's the whole shoe.  Look at that.  That probably takes him from 5'3 to 5'5 and a half, or 5'5.  It makes him more of a man's height.  There's a couple inches right there.  Or 5'4 to 5'6.  You don't know what's going on, like, above the sole also, because sometimes they put a  little block in the shoe itself.  Right.  So now you got the platform, plus there's another platform in the shoe. 
[01:26:30]  In the shoe.  In the shoe.  This is another dude right here who's genius at what he does, and his biggest crime is longevity.  Just because he's been around this long, everybody finds shit to pick on him for.  Yes, they do.  Like, he's short.  God damn.  He keeps giving the same performance.  And it's only...  Is that fucking Sarah Palin?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, she looks good.  Doesn't she look amazing?  Wow.  Wouldn't mind giving her a good kiss.  They fucking had...  They had to ugly her up, so people would try to vote for her.  Yeah, I would vote for this woman.  Yeah.  No matter what her policies were, man. 
[01:27:00]  Well, you know what the thing with Pacino is?  They gave it away at the end of The Godfather, where they kissed her, and they go, Don Corleone,  and when you pan back, he's actually standing on the desk.  And Kay goes, I married a dwarf.  And the fucking door closes, and she eats Talia Shire's box.  I had it killed, because it was going to be a midget.  It fell out, and it was the same size as you, Michael.  This shortness has to end. 
[01:27:30]  He punches her in the kneecap.  He reaches up and slams the door shut.  He reaches up and pushes the knob.  Little teeny motherfucker.  It's fucking Pacino.  I know.  Give me his short stuff.  Teeny motherfucker.  Around the neighborhood, he's a little phone book on the seat, Al.  Oh, fuck.  We're all punch drunk.  I don't think anyone has slept in this room.  No.  I got two hours of sleep last night.  That's why I was late today.  I slept for about half an hour. 
[01:28:00]  In the middle of the night, there was a rainstorm, about three or two to three in the morning,  and I slept for about 15 minutes.  I got maybe three.  I was this close to getting room service, like at an ungodly hour.  Why, where were you?  It would have taken too long.  I'm over at the hotel because we did the show last night, and I don't drive.  I don't like driving back.  Oh, because you have to go.  You don't live in the sleep.  Yeah, I'm out on Long Island.  It makes it easy, right?  So I stayed in the hotel, and I was like, you know, I get room service.  Let me get the...  And then I actually said, hey, asshole, put the fucking phone down because it's going  to take a long time.  You're going to be up. 
[01:28:30]  That's another hour.  By the time I get it, I'm going to have to go to work.  Yeah.  So I just went to sleep in a second.  We're skating today.  Like, right when I laid down.  Kevin really helped us out because we're skating today.  You guys didn't have much juice going?  I'm going to get you to the first guest.  Honestly?  No.  What's going on?  What's Jon Bon Jovi on TV for?  Oh.  He's not divorcing his wife, is he?  They showed him and his wife.  I always kind of liked the fact that he was still with the same chick all this time.  We did an event together.  He looked pretty happy.  With his lady?  No, I didn't show us there.  I was just trying to brag. 
[01:29:00]  What was the event?  What was the event?  Oh, I don't want to get into it.  Come on.  What did you and JBJ do?  Oh, me and Voss inducted Abbott and Costello into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.  You did it?  Me and Rich Voss, yeah.  Right on.  They asked me to present.  They didn't say what, but I couldn't.  It was probably for that.  Believe me.  We were not first on the list.  We were after quite a few no's.  They're like, all right.  How about one of these two fucking, one of these two middles?  Well, it was originally supposed to be Jerry Stiller who actually dropped out.  Really?  He had something else to me.  I don't know what the fuck he was doing.  This is the story, by the way, not to interrupt. 
[01:29:30]  What is it?  Chassidy Bono is now, is going to become a man.  It's amazing she looks so pretty and feminine.  Holy shit.  You know what she looks like?  This is the story of the day, though.  Kevin, look at her picture.  She already looks like a man.  She looks like the-  Chassidy is more sunny and less sheer.  Oh, she's already made the switch?  Dude, she's going all in.  She's in the process.  Do you remember the fucking, the cartoon mice Abbott and Costello?  That's what she looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the cartoon mice version.  Oh, she is a-  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  Babbitt!  They used to just blatantly rip off.  I loved when they were doing, hey, Babbitt, I'm a spitfire! 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah, spitfire.  I haven't thought about that cartoon in a while.  Yeah.  Oh, she is awful.  She is awful.  No, but you know what?  She brought us to that cartoon, so God bless her.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying she's got great comedy fodder.  She was adorable when they used to bring her out on the show at the end of the Sonny  and Cher nitty gritty comedy hour.  They'd bring her out and-  Look at her right there in that picture.  And they'd sing and she'd point at her vagina and cry and yell, yuck. 
[01:30:30]  I don't understand, but she, all this time she's identified as a lesbian.  Right.  Yes.  Doesn't that set back the movement?  Wow.  Oh, she is a man.  She's already a man.  She fucking does not look very good.  But, I mean, isn't the idea, if she's, well, I'm, I mean, I guess if you're changing sex.  Just like John Madden.  What is this?  Gay, lesbian, transsexual.  Dude, she doesn't even have a hint of a feminine body.  No, I mean, just the general heading covers a bunch of people. 
[01:31:00]  Like, if I was, I mean, I'm certainly not casting judgment here, but if I was somebody  who, let's say somebody, let's say I was a representative of fat people, you know, and I got out  there and spoke on behalf of fat people, like, we have rights too, while I was eating a sandwich  and shit.  And then all of a sudden I found out in the daily news that I went and got, you know,  drastic, what do they call that shit?  A gastrointestinal.  Gastrointestinal and a big old fat suck and they took it all out.  And so I was like, then like you guys and shit, wouldn't, wouldn't then people be like,  well, what the fuck, dude? 
[01:31:30]  Like you were our spokesperson.  Yeah.  If she goes, uh, if she becomes a man, she's no longer a lesbian.  She's not like the, one of those, like, uh, benchmark, she becomes straight.  Right.  Then she just, unless she wants to fuck guys, then she's gay again.  That would be fun.  But she didn't want to fuck guys when she was a girl.  It's so confusing.  It's like Victor Victoria.  Yeah.  The whole thing is very confusing.  Very, very.  Good for her though, man.  You know what?  She, she, she didn't wait till the end.  She's not seven years old doing it.  She's like, fuck it.  I did it.  I did this for 40 and I'm going to do the next 40 as a dude. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  If I had half a ball, I would be like, you know what?  I did the first 40 as a man.  I'm going to do the next 40 as a woman.  Imagine just doing that and just go, you know something?  Totally.  I'm like, take it.  I just want to get fucked from now on.  And not being like gay or not even wanting to do that.  Just going.  Just do it for the goof.  Just for the, not even for the goof.  Just for the goof.  You know, I was a man for half my life.  Let me see what this is all about.  Absolutely.  And then you're just getting fucked and going, oh, this kind of sucks.  This is beef.  I don't like getting fucked by a man.  My fucking X ball pussy doesn't self-lubricate. 
[01:32:30]  I got to fucking dump KY in there or a jam or fucking marmalade.  Do they keep the prostate in there so that the semen actually lubricates the man-made vagina?  I don't know.  I think they would keep that in there to.  That could be the worst question I've ever heard.  Might have a lot of hormones in there though.  I don't want to know the answer to that question.  I don't know, but I don't think you saw, that's how I realized one time, I think I was fucking  a post-op because the pussy just didn't feel right.  But it felt like, it felt like, it felt creative.  It's like when you're looking, it's like going, it's like looking at a mountain and 
[01:33:00]  looking at the Matterhorn at Disneyland.  Yeah.  You're like, well, it looks like a mountain.  It's not quite right.  Yeah.  Something seems a little fake about it.  But it's harder to come on this mountain.  You were actually virtually docking in a way.  In a weird way, yeah.  That is just an inside out penis.  Wow, you were like a Starship Enterprise, man.  Yeah.  It was bizarre.  You were going into space.  It was like fucking an eye socket.  It just didn't feel like a vag.  You know, a vag will grip you.  And this was kind of like I was just attacking Sammy Davis.  What is that? 
[01:33:30]  Which one?  Oh, these pictures.  Here we go.  Is that a tranny?  Let me see, Danny, please.  I'll make a quick determination here.  That's definitely a tranny.  You need the...  That's not a tranny.  It's got a fucking puss.  It's not a sexual.  Oh, post-op.  That used to be a wiener.  Post-op boo.  You got to do post-op close-ups.  I do this a lot.  Yes, post-op close-up.  Don't forget the dashes.  Post-op close-up.  Holy shit.  I do this a lot.  I do this a lot. 
[01:34:00]  God damn.  Well, now it's post-op hair.  Yeah, tranny.  Plants and dentures.  A close-up little boy post-up.  All right, we got one.  Oh, see, there's nothing there that really...  See, when they open up the pussy, there's really not a lot of pussy there.  I mean, come on, man.  Give it up.  That's amazing.  It really is.  That they took a human being who was not a woman and turned that human being into a woman.  You can't really stretch, though.  You can't pull.  You got to leave it just alone.  It seems more aesthetic than anything else.  Yeah.  It actually looks more... 
[01:34:30]  It's...  Less sloppy than a female vagina.  And that's why I boo it.  I boo it.  You like fucking exploded ham sandwiches.  Oh, disaster.  Post-op blog, dude.  Post-op blog.  Asian females with a pussy.  Wow.  That was going to be the name of my fucking biography.  God damn it.  Now I've got to come up with something else.  But if you're going to fuck a post-op, why not just fuck a chick?  Lady boy post-op bouncing...  Okay, hairy post-op pussy.  Click on that, man.  Let's see if we can get it tight.  Come on, Dan.  Let's open that up.  With our big fake tits.  Hairy post-op pussy. 
[01:35:00]  Why not just fuck a chick?  I like a site where you know what you're getting.  Yeah.  I've got to tell you, man.  Listen, that vagina looked more like an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  Yeah, it's positioned weird.  They actually just pulled the asshole up.  Wow, wait a minute.  Is that the...  Well, that's the asshole, and then above it is the vag.  Flexible post-op spreads her ass.  Yeah, she's a good man.  I'm glad they told us what it was about.  Two fingers in.  I don't like the...  What's the clothes?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nauty-day self-nurse with big perky tits.  She looks like Michael Caine at the end of Dressed to Kill. 
[01:35:30]  Close-up post-op insertion.  Post-op spread ass.  Post-op ladyboy.  She's kind of pretty in the face, but the body...  No.  Dude, she's not even pretty in the face.  I'm sure she is.  Ugly.  No, she's not.  I mean, she's visually interesting.  Okay, click on that one, man.  Post-op ladyboy fingering her asshole.  It's his asshole.  Ladyboy.  Oh, it's her.  Let's be respectful.  All right, my bad.  It's one of those sites that take you to something else.  Oh, these have weens.  Yeah.  It's just cops. 
[01:36:00]  Okay, you got to click to get to the good stuff.  They're pre-op.  Oh, come on.  Go back down to the finger in the asshole.  Pre-op is called a man.  No, it's not.  Look at the...  I keep going away from the mic.  Look at the pussy, how it's made.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one isn't that bad.  Apparently, they use part of the scrotum to make the labia.  Is that true?  Yeah, and then they take the penis and gut it and turn it inside out.  And push it back into you.  The vaginal canal is an inside out dick.  Making like potato skins with it.  Yes, exactly.  Sounds like you're describing the hokey pokey. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, it's kind of fascinating, but what's the difference between...  I mean, because it's connected to a human being with a soul.  But it really is...  It is kind of like fucking one of those pocket pussies or something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like just as manufactured as that.  Yeah, it's fake.  You know, it's fake.  But, you know, it's what goes along with it.  Like, you know, we like the same movies.  Yeah.  You know, we used to...  A good personality, maybe.  Look at this one.  Trimmed up post-op spread shot.  That's horrendous.  What's going on there? 
[01:37:00]  I mean, that's the thing.  It's like it doesn't really look like much.  Like a little neck clam.  That's just opened up.  It's like tiny tim.  Show me post-op, babe.  Oh, that's good.  Nice scar.  Post-op with a little appendectomy.  Oh, come on.  Look at that face.  Oh, shit.  That's not a good face.  What the fuck is that?  That's the...  Go back down.  That looks like...  Oh, I love model twains.  From fucking...  What was it?  A Mighty Wind?  Wow, these are some weird...  Go back down, man.  Okay.  That's super tight post-op mangina. 
[01:37:30]  Mangina?  You don't want a mangina.  You don't want a fucking mangina.  Go down, Danny.  There's a close-up of this slit.  Okay.  It doesn't look like a good pussy.  Post-op, trim, post-op, pussy.  No, it's just a slit, but...  I hate them like that.  But they're not pulling them open.  Still, man, give that up.  That's amazing.  At one point, they went stick there,  and some guy turned it into something.  Medically, it is an amazing thing.  Dr. Mengele fucking got in there.  Let's say all the women just suddenly disappeared  like a virus took all the women away.  You know they'd be fucking...  You'd be fucking that. 
[01:38:00]  Flipping dudes crazy.  You'd be fucking that.  And you'd be happy with it  because it'd be better than fucking your fist.  Yeah.  Look at this one.  What's going on there?  Busty blonde post-op with hairy pussy.  Mom, are you listening?  Kevin loves this site.  I hate to bring up any of your older movies,  but that sounds like one of the videos from Clerks.  It does.  It really does.  Look at these two.  Oh, look at that.  There's a post-op being fucked by a pre-op.  Now, that's fucking great.  That's support in the community.  Post-op, transsexual, Thai, ladyboy, see ya. 
[01:38:30]  That's a lot of words.  That is fantastic.  Let's go down a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, keep going.  All right.  Post-op, pre-op, no.  Do you think they're all fucking trannies?  Yeah.  I mean, wouldn't it behoove you to, like, get, like, kind of a tomboyish-looking girl  and be like, yeah, she's a tranny.  Look how good she looks.  Oh, that kind of would be.  You know what I'm saying?  So then you'd be like, holy shit, because they need to throw one out there  that looks insanely good to keep hope alive so that you're like, all right,  I'm with the she-male concept because I met one or I saw one online who was hot. 
[01:39:00]  Like Hilary Swank from Boys Don't Cry.  If you can get a girl like that who looks fucking hot.  Yes, yes.  And just pretend, like, pretend and be like, well, yeah, man, she was totally,  she had her dick cut off.  Her name used to be Bob, but look at her, you'd fuck her, right?  And then, well, people would then call you things.  But then you'd find out, and then you could be like, ha-ha.  Yeah, that's true.  Come on, this is the makings of a rom-com right here.  I'm in tight with Warner Brothers.  Let's pitch this around.  Jimmy, you throw in some jokes, and we'll sell this shit, man. 
[01:39:30]  MC Hammer's on Channel 11.  Yeah, he's coming over here, right?  He's making the rounds.  I think he's got his son with him.  Okay.  Reality show.  He looks different, man.  He tweets a lot.  He's one of the top Twitters I heard.  There she is.  Is he doing a reality show?  The ex.  Who, is that your lady right there?  That was my ex a year ago.  Where?  Let me see.  Oh, boy.  The kid?  Cut to your ex.  Cut to your ex.  That chick?  Yeah.  And that's the one that Gene Simmons tried to buy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking Gene Simmons. 
[01:40:00]  I like that.  You're over the Gene Simmons thing.  Come on.  Oh, believe me.  I don't care.  She actually, ooh, did she catch me while I was being a bad boy?  I had a girl in my walk-in closet when she walked into the bedroom.  You were literally caught with somebody in the closet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was right in the closet.  He had his cock in the cookie jar.  And still managed to fucking.  A post-op tranny.  Yeah, he was bitch about fucking.  Gene Simmons wanted to fuck you that one time.  This is revenge.  That annoyed me.  Why do you think I'm doing this? 
[01:40:30]  It's for us.  Yeah.  So I can forgive you.  Even Steven.  You want to show Kevin the electrocution video?  Oh, that's fucking phenomenal.  What is it?  God, does anybody have any food?  I'm about to pass it out.  Yeah, so am I.  Jimmy was just eating.  What's in that bag, dude?  What's in your bag?  What's in the bag?  Bring a new bagel.  Whose is it?  It hasn't been taken.  Whose was it?  Kevin, just take it.  I didn't want it.  I'm serious.  Is this gross for me to be scapping for food and shit?  No one touched it.  Do you guys keep on this where I'm like, can I have your food?  If you're just half eaten, that would be a problem. 
[01:41:00]  This is just like being on the set, right?  It is kind of, man.  But no, on the set, someone would have offered me this an hour ago.  Hey, Bruce, are you going to eat that?  How do you not offer Kevin something?  Kevin, this is the hottest.  We didn't know if he ate before he came.  This bagel's dry.  They did offer him.  Oh, there's some butter here, sweetie pie.  Or is there cream cheese?  Or cream cheese?  Oh, you're in.  Now it's exactly like being on the movie set.  Kevin, this is the hottest video in the O&A community right now.  Literally.  It's making the rounds.  Watch this one.  Hey, Sean Scott told me that you guys showed him a video. 
[01:41:30]  He was trying to describe it.  He's like, yeah, they'll remember.  Wow.  What video did we show?  We showed him a few.  It might have been two girls, one cup.  No, it wasn't that.  That was during our two girls, one cup phase.  You guys were the first on two girls, one cup, though.  It might have been remove your hat.  No, I don't think he was in for that.  Remove your hat.  My favorite part is as Jim Jeffries begins laughing, and he immediately joins the community.  Yes.  People are shocked and disgusted by it, and then they just chime in and start having fun with it.  I think YouTube finally took that video down. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, why?  Yeah.  So, Danny, can't watch the video.  It's very short.  Yeah, this is, though.  The sounds are great.  This is India, where people ride on the trains.  My phone?  Yeah, it's good video.  They don't just ride in the trains.  They ride on the trains in India.  Guy on top of the train, obviously.  Yeah, and then a couple of guys.  People are trying to get up there, and the guy won't help them.  And it happens.  But then it cuts to this gentleman.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit. 
[01:42:30]  Isn't it great to watch people die?  He's broken.  His head burning.  I wasn't prepared for that.  No.  No, see, he wasn't prepared for that.  His head is burning.  His head's on fire.  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  Apparently.  Isn't that horrible?  I don't want to leave the house.  Yeah.  Yeah, go back.  But you don't feel it.  Yeah, go back.  No, that guy did not feel a thing.  That is the...  He just uses a little handrail.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Go.  That's it.  Oh, my God.  He was just there.  Just there.  Gone.  He was dead before he hit the top of the train. 
[01:43:00]  In a split microsecond, he's done.  And you're eating a toasted bagel.  How ironic.  Oh.  I don't know, dude.  I look at that, and I can't believe there was ever a moment in my life where I ever sweated  some stranger on the internet going, your movie sucks.  Yeah.  Exactly, right?  Holy shit.  Look at that.  It's the human torch, dude.  He's like flame on.  Yeah.  His hand is still on the wire.  Right there.  His hand is on fire at the moment of contact.  His head's on fire, and his, like, crotch and feet.  His leg is on fire.  That's pretty horrifying.  That is really nasty, man. 
[01:43:30]  I want to thank a willful boy from Jersey.  We showed Sean the One Guy, One Cup video.  Oh, that was all right.  Did you have that?  What was One Guy, One Cup?  Oh, fuck.  That's kind of silly.  Show Kevin.  Is it the jar?  The dude, Glass-Ass?  Yes.  Yeah, we did that on Smodcast.  That's horrible.  Glass-Ass, amazing.  Glass-Ass.  Do you believe it?  I mean, I read the follow-up report.  He's done more.  Absolutely, I believe it.  But it's true, and he said that.  He's very scarred up.  But he was too calm.  But he said that he's, it was something that he was used to anyway. 
[01:44:00]  So it was a job, on-the-job hazard kind of thing.  He has a great life, obviously.  He says he keeps on the down-low, nobody knows.  Is this supposed to be the news?  And he said he's not gay.  There's a photo of him, too, of his face.  I've seen a photo of his face.  How embarrassing.  People at the office know that's you.  They're doing hammer time on the local news.  Yeah, I'm like, this is the news?  Your ex is doing some hammer time.  All right, now we know what we're doing.  E-Rock?  Wow, your lady's dancing around.  Oh, no, she's got the pants. 
[01:44:30]  What are they doing?  They all got the pants on.  Look at the news guy.  That guy is the doctor.  He does the medical reports on this news channel.  Well, how am I supposed to take him seriously?  There goes all his credibility, out the window.  Yeah.  They've done this now every time MC Hammer's been anywhere.  God, he looks so different.  Yeah, he's not sick of doing this.  They put the pants on.  I just saw yesterday.  Look at it.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Now he's got to do the MC Hammer.  He can still do it, man.  He can still do it.  He's got to do the hammer time. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, Christ.  That's great.  That's like making an Asian guy spin kick when he comes in the studio.  Get the black guy to dance.  Make him drive poorly.  That's good.  This is good.  This is the fucking old lady that made Oprah drive her home in fucking the color purple.  I want to see dancing.  Talk to the guy.  Have I had an interesting story?  It's like, why would you just make him dance?  Do the color purple line again?  I want to see somebody dance.  I just made that up.  My favorite line in that movie is when Whoopi Goldberg is putting a curse on Danny Glover. 
[01:45:30]  And she's like, until you do right by me, everything you do is going to fail.  Oh, damn.  I do that to all my enemies.  And then Danny Glover looked at her.  Until you do right by me.  And he said, I'm too old for this shit.  And she went, wrong movie, stupid.  And he tried to get a cab and had to walk home.  But it's a goddamn can't-get-a-cab story, right?  Who was that fucking broad that used to come that he would fuck with his wife in the house?  Oh, yeah.  The really hot one, Danny, in the movie. 
[01:46:00]  Which movie?  The Color Purple.  He had that chick that would come, Miss Avery.  Yeah, the chick.  The singer.  The singer, yeah, yeah.  And they had a lesbian thing.  Her and Whoopi Goldberg had a lesbian encounter.  And then Whoopi Goldberg invented pants or something.  At the end, she's got a pants shop.  And everyone's like, what are these?  Nobody's ever worn pants before.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  Wow, is that hammer in a fucking G? 
[01:46:30]  He's got a little fucking-  Oh, look at it.  Oh, he's in a fucking banana hammock.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this from?  This is from the Pumps and a Bump video.  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  Let's see it.  Play it.  What is he doing?  Guy's all cock.  What the fuck, hammer?  He is all cock.  Jesus Christ.  He's got a hammer in his pants.  Come on.  It was basically just a commercial for his penis.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Hey, man.  I know where that house is.  Yeah?  In Los Angeles, yeah.  I can't believe it.  I love pool, rat pool videos.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Does he use that to balance?  Like a T-Rex tail?  Goddamn.  All right.  Hence the name hammer.  What's it like to have it hooked up, dude?  That's just-  Sorry, it's a burden.  You think he fluffed that?  How could you not?  I don't think that's real.  I think he might have something in there because it's a little too stiff. 
[01:47:30]  Now we got a question for him.  It's a little too stiff.  Yeah, make sure we have this video right.  I'm not saying-  I'm sure he has a huge cock, but I'm saying for the purposes of this video, he probably  has a stunt penis in there.  Why?  Because no guy wants to watch, like, Hammer's fucking dick and ball set.  Here we are.  We're all looking.  We can't take our eyes off it.  If it was in front of us, we'd touch it.  We can't.  Holy shit.  Come on, Hammer.  Wow.  He's doing a lot of that move.  The pump.  And he's in a pool.  Oh, come on. 
[01:48:00]  Excellent pause, sir.  He's tending.  Perfect pause.  Yeah, he's the king of the internet.  Yeah, that seems-  I think that might be his stuffer.  A little prosthetic device there?  Maybe, because you don't see any helmet outline.  You see, like, a little bump and then it's all ball.  He's pup-tending in a fucking G-string and a thong.  But anybody would.  Hey, you know what we did the other night?  Sure.  After that hockey tournament in Brantford, which, again, I cannot tell you how much-  You guys got to bring a team next year.  When was the last time you ever played?  Wow.  Did you ever play street hockey?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with the nephews, we kind of get, you know, we fuck around a little bit. 
[01:48:30]  You got to bring a team next year.  Yeah.  That would be cool.  I kid you not, man.  It was so much fucking fun.  Someone said your team was all fat guys.  We were.  Jesus.  My friend Malcolm, who's with me, is my size, too.  He's probably out there.  He is.  He's right there.  He's like, Malcolm fucking, not only did he play, dude, best fucking sacrifice I've  seen ever.  Like, I was out of position.  I got out of position at one point.  Dude took a shot, and I went to save it, and it piped, piped, and then dropped right  back out in front of the net. 
[01:49:00]  But, meantime, I was, I'm sorry, way the fuck out of position over there.  Sure, sure.  And I'm struggling.  At the same time, I landed wrong on my knees.  That's all this fucking weight landing wrong on the knee, and I quick had to pop back so  that it wouldn't pop out and shit.  Oh, fuck.  All of a sudden, I look over.  There's the ball laying, and here comes one of their fucking dudes.  The other dudes just sweep it right in, and Malcolm, out of nowhere, is like, boy!  Hurls himself at the ground right in front of the fucking net, rolls onto the ball and  shit, and everyone's trying to chip it out from under him.  Such a huge heart sacrifice. 
[01:49:30]  All heart, man.  Total heart player.  Malcolm.  But that night, we did a Smodcast Live at their theater up there.  We sold out this 1,100-seat theater and did Smodcast Live.  It was so fun.  That was fun, too.  People love your Smodcast.  You've got to bring a team next year, man.  You don't have to be good, because we weren't good.  Well, we wouldn't be.  Yeah.  It's just fun to play, man.  I could sneak a few of my brothers in.  They'd do all right.  Totally.  All the ringers.  And I guarantee you've got fans out there that would fucking play in a heartbeat, man.  And they'd be good, too.  Sure.  I had such a good time. 
[01:50:00]  Malcolm been up all night, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, no one has slept in this room.  Yeah, Malcolm fucking slept in the trailer.  I need a mic over there, Malcolm.  What are you doing in the movie?  Are you guys just friends, or do you work on the film team?  I'm kind of the one-man entourage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, Malcolm's my friend.  Do you find an assistant?  He's a...  No, not my assistant.  Although he has played my assistant from time to time.  But yeah, we've been friends since we met in 94 at the Toronto Film Festival.  Everyone's always like, is that your brother?  I'm like, no.  We're just both fat.  The fat and the beard.  Yeah, we don't shave. 
[01:50:30]  A couple of bears.  He is a bear.  Malcolm's a bear.  I am a bear.  Flat out.  Oh, yeah?  Malcolm has fucked.  Malcolm had this boyfriend, dude, who was the prettiest man I ever saw in my life.  The prettiest man ever.  And all he wanted to do was fuck Malcolm.  It was a spellbinding.  What happened?  I used that word twice.  But it was.  When you looked at this dude, you're like, this dude could get so much pussy.  This dude could steal my wife from me, your wife from you.  This dude was cover boy handsome.  And this was the guy he wanted to stick it in.  Or not stick it in.  Sorry, my bad.  Yeah, you're not a creature.  I'm a fag.  I'm not that gay.  Yeah, my bad. 
[01:51:00]  My bad.  I'm sorry.  You got lines.  So you, uh, he was like, uh, what would they call a guy like that who's into a bear?  A cub?  He's a cub.  A cub.  How cute.  And he liked the beer and he liked the big husky brain.  He liked the big, yeah.  I mean, it's-  Dude, tell all these cats what you say sometimes to the fucking dudes.  They love the chubby guys with the gut.  What do I say to them?  I say suck it.  What do you want to say?  No, but they're fucking sucking and don't you like, you told me, he told me, fuck it,  I'll do it.  He told me that he takes his fucking, he's like, trying to explain. 
[01:51:30]  He's like, when it comes to fucking sex, man, with a bear, he's going, what's a negative  in your world is an asset in mine.  So I take my gut and slap it on top of their head and I rub it in their face.  Yeah, you rub their, uh, their face on their, on your gut.  They love it.  What do you say to them?  Really?  What do you say while it's happening?  Do you have to call it out?  Is that something you acknowledge?  Or?  Like, do you have to, do you have to prepare them?  Like, I'm about to put my gut on your face.  They see it coming.  So it happens.  They see it coming.  But is it like one of those things, like when you're fucking and you're like, I'm going 
[01:52:00]  to come, like you state the obvious.  Do you say shit?  Like, I'm rubbing my fucking.  I'm rubbing my fat now.  You don't, it's, it's all.  You don't?  You've never done it.  It's all happening.  You rubbed my fat on you.  I would totally, if I was the guy where I could like fucking surrender and I'm like, I accept  this and it's who I am and I have such great self-esteem, I would totally be  that dude.  And I would totally be like, do you feel the fucking lard in your eyes?  Taste the stretch mark goodness.  Next time, dude.  For you, I'll do that next time. 
[01:52:30]  So what happened with the cub?  What happened with the cub?  It was, it was that kind of, he, um, they dated for like three years, two years.  Yeah.  And it's funny.  Cause like what used to be my biggest fucking problem was my fat ended up kind of like,  he, he kind of liked my fat.  He didn't like my, my brain.  He was using it for your gut.  Literally.  He was using them for his cock and his gut and shit.  Wow.  Malcolm wanted to be in a relationship and he was like, can't we just fuck?  It's true.  Holy shit.  Dude, if you saw this guy, you would be like, I hate him. 
[01:53:00]  And he's Zac Efron.  He's just like a pretty dude.  So you dumped him?  We kind of dumped each other.  He was a soccer player too.  He was.  So he has athletic body.  I was totally, I mean, he was a good piece of ass.  Oh, why not?  He's playing hard guy now, but fuck it.  We're getting down in the elevator.  He's going to be like, I can't believe I referred to the love of my life as a piece of  ass.  I got to call the company.  I'm so sorry.  If you hear this, I love you.  How long did you split?  Two years ago.  Oh, so it's pretty much beyond.  It's, it's, no, it's, there's been. 
[01:53:30]  I've taken many Cubs since.  Oh, really?  All right.  This motherfucker is my, uh, my connection, my connect in the gay world.  He's the dude that always gives me, um, head.  No.  The terminology, what's going on.  He was the dude who introduced me to the idea of the bear.  And I was just like, get out of here.  He's like your gay technical advisor.  Totally.  Totally.  So you don't do wrong gay references and make an ass out of yourself in film.  You have to have it correct.  Totally.  And also the gay friend that you could be like, you suck cock.  And he's like, shut up.  But you're right. 
[01:54:00]  Cause he did.  My friend is, uh, my friend's a gay comic.  I don't know if he's bi cause he fucks chicks too.  He's like, he, uh, was helping me decorate my apartment.  And, uh, he, most people don't know he's gay.  And, uh, the way he was talking about the other guy, it was fucking great.  Like there was this big designer.  He was like, I'll see if he'll help fix your place up.  I'm like, is he really expensive?  He goes, oh, he'll do me a favor.  I'm like, well, do you know him well?  He goes, oh, I came in his face.  But that's what you realize though.  If there were no women, it would just be the unchecked male sexuality.  And that's what it would be. 
[01:54:30]  You'd be like sitting around.  If there were no chicks, it'd be us sitting around fucking making jokes and shit.  And then be like, hey, Jimmy, suck my dick.  You know, you'd have no choice and you'd fucking go for it.  Maybe you wouldn't like it.  You might, you know, be like, I miss pussy.  But still, you'd do it, right?  I think that's why there's that fine balance.  Like, you know, the chicks are sometimes, because if it was just all guys and that whole attitude,  you'd just be fucking all the time.  Are you just fucking all the time?  Is that pretty much it?  He goes in like periods. 
[01:55:00]  Sometimes he's all celibate.  And then sometimes he goes on a tour.  I'm not into fucking.  I'm into getting my dick sucked a lot.  I'm a selfish top.  Yes.  Listen how fucking, listen how good this dude has it, man.  They come over.  Like, he meets him on, what is it, Bear 411?  Bear 411.  He goes on a website.  It's a website designed just for fucking getting your dick sucked or sucking the dick of others.  Really?  He hooks up with a date and shit.  And they come to him.  He goes to where they are.  They come to him.  They come in.  He gets off. 
[01:55:30]  And then he's like, okay, go.  Ah, no reship, huh?  No reship.  No reship.  How about we get Steve in here immediately?  We want you to look at our friend who we know is a bear, but he doesn't think he's a bear.  He doesn't want to acknowledge it.  He's a bear.  We were at the, uh, here comes Steve.  Here comes Steve.  If Malcolm says woof, then he's a bear.  Let's see if he passes the woof test.  Yeah, here he comes.  He's going to try to walk tough.  It's impossible.  Ask him any question.  Talk to him about anything. 
[01:56:00]  Steve's like great.  He's smiling.  Out this motherfucker already.  We've had it with him.  Yeah, we're tired of his shenanigans.  Hi, Steve.  That's Malcolm.  He's a total bear.  You're a bear.  There you go.  See?  Well, there's a woof test or no?  He's a total bear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Steve, at least Malcolm thinks you're a bear.  Thank you, Malcolm.  I appreciate that.  Now it's a, uh, it's 100% of the room again.  It's official.  Again.  It's official.  Yeah, thank you.  I appreciate that.  Actually, you're wearing very nice jeans today.  He had capris on last week. 
[01:56:30]  He had capris on last week.  They were long shorts.  No, no.  No, they were capris.  They were capris.  They were long shorts.  They weren't.  Kevin wears long shorts.  These are long shorts, dude.  Elephant trunks.  Kevin wears long shorts.  If they go tight at the bottom, those are capris.  And they weren't tight.  Yeah.  They were capri pants.  And then he had one.  And then he had some jeans with embroidered flowers on them.  Uh, it was just, it was, uh, affliction jeans with like, um, with, uh, skull and, uh, roses.  So it's a cool thing?  Yeah, it wasn't a cool thing.  It's a metal rock and roll thing.  Yeah, it's a rock and roll thing.  Look at all his ass.  It's a rock and roll thing. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  Absolutely.  The capris was.  It's so rock and roll.  It was.  Are you ever wearing those capris again?  Never.  Look at the pants.  Dude, that is rock and roll.  Yeah.  Look at those.  That's like Guns and Roses and shit.  Oh, okay.  Rock and roll.  Back in the day.  No, it's not.  That's cock and mouth.  All you know is cock and roll.  So that's not, show the capri pants to Malcolm, please, because.  Yeah, we're trying to get there, right?  We really need to, uh, that's a good tweet.  We really do, uh.  We so need to break at this point. 
[01:57:30]  We gotta just show him his pants.  Show the pants and then we go.  Well, whatever.  I think, oh, shit.  I'm sorry, hetero.  Just looking at that.  Can I shout out Carnegie one more time?  Yes, Kevin.  Folks, if you haven't bought Carnegie Hall tickets, please go do so.  It's gonna be a fun show.  We're all going.  There's only a few tickets left.  All these cats are going.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And these cats are no funny.  I'm gonna bomb.  Wednesday, an evening with cats.  I'm so terrified, I'm gonna bomb.  Yeah, you're gonna do well.  Let me get the website out.  Uh, View Askew.  Uh, View, A-S-K-E-W.com for the Kevin Smith tickets. 
[01:58:00]  Or CarnegieHall.org.  Where's Patrice?  Org?  In the office.  Patrice, why does he just come in?  Oh, that's a start.  Because if he comes in, then we'll never break.  We gotta at least get to a break.  I'm gonna get out of here and go get some sleep.  All right, let's take a break.  Go take a snooze there, Kevin.  Thanks for hosting, folks.  I'm so glad that I was shooting nights, because it gave me a chance to come in.  Bro, you know what?  Because I haven't been able to get in.  And because of you, now, in front of me, Gene Simmons on NPR.  We get to take a look.  You got it?  You gotta listen to it.  It's a fascinating listen.  I don't know if we're gonna get to it today, but we're gonna get to that soon. 
[01:58:30]  Listen to it off air, and then I guarantee you'll want to play highlights from it.  Kevin, it was a pleasure, man.  Always a pleasure, boys.  I'll see you guys.  Was that some fucking naked men up there?  That was Bear.  Bear 411?  That's Steve's capris, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, come on, dude.  Those aren't Gene shorts.  Malcolm, yeah.  You know, these are Gene shorts.  Malcolm, you gotta comment on the capris.  That's not a knife.  That's a knife.  He says he's straight?  That's good enough.  He says he's straight.  Yes. 
[01:59:00]  Straight.  Really?  He identified as a straight.  You're not passing.  Come on.  I'm sorry, dude.  I just called like I see you.  I should show him.  I should show him my phone.  My gator is off the fucking, you know.  He's a very good gator.  If he don't know, who would?  Yeah, true.  Well, I am engaged to a lovely woman, and I don't have a, I certainly don't have a homosexual  Oh, he's stammering.  Come on, come on, come on.  No, it's really, I really don't know.  Is he going to say he doesn't have a gay bone in his body?  Yes.  Let it be known, Steve.  He usually will.  You're usually very articulate, Steve. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, you're really.  You're a little.  I'm a stammering a little.  How are you saying?  I think you're a little smitten.  Steve, in moments like this, it's just best to be like, I am gay, and I love cock.  Can I go now?  You know what, Kevin?  I've tried that so many times, it doesn't work anymore.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  Not off the show and in your bedroom.  Now, do you like other bears, or do you only like cubs?  I'm more of a cub guy.  So you wouldn't be attracted to Steve because he's a bear?  No, not so much.  They'd rather one another like magnets.  Jimmy, I know we got a break, but maybe we should bring Travis in real fast. 
[02:00:00]  Yes, bring Travis.  Either Travis is probably too very good.  Travis has too much.  Well, let's see.  Let's just see.  Bring Sam in here.  Bring Sam in.  Sam and Travis.  Would you let Steve drink out of your mule?  It was late night.  I mean, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  A mouth is a mouth.  Here comes Sam.  It's a great philosophy.  Don't mind the hair.  Now, here's Travis.  Steve moves.  He's a total cub.  Yeah, he's a cub.  Right?  Totally.  Yeah.  Look, he's got hairy arms and stuff and the facial hair.  What about the facial hair?  How about Erica?  So if he's hairless, is he a twink? 
[02:00:30]  Pretty much.  Here's a twink.  What makes him an otter?  Come on in, twink.  Yeah, this dude might be a twink.  Is he a straight hip?  I know what you want.  Despite his straight hips, do you think that he's a twink?  He's more twinkish.  Yes, definitely.  Yeah, yeah.  Awful hips.  He's kissed men, though.  Yeah, he's kissed men.  He has no problem with that.  I didn't say I have no problem with that.  It just happened before.  Yeah, more than once, though.  And you didn't get, like, yeah, there's a big difference between having no problem with 
[02:01:00]  it and fucking, like, I didn't punch the guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Three times.  How about, what would you classify?  Three times he's kissed a guy.  Eric.  Erica.  Yeah.  Troll.  Those are the guys that go to the gay club after it closed and just lick the floor?  They're going to kill us if we don't go to break. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, we got to break.  It's getting to a point where we don't have a choice.  Thank you.  Thank you for having.  Thanks for having.  If I could get in and call in throughout the rest of this, we totally will.  Whenever we go to Nights, I'll try to come in.  Maybe if you're on the phone and Bruce Willis is right next to you.  Good fucking luck to you.  Yeah, I know.  He's not even going to push that one.  I felt so bad, like we were in Far Rockaway and they were going to knock on the trailer  and there were five cops out there, rookies, you know, and they were just like, hey, can  we take pictures?  And I was like, sure, absolutely. 
[02:02:00]  What are you going to say, no to a cop?  Yeah.  And they were like, do you think Bruce will come over and sign?  And I was like, um, I was like, what do I do?  I was like, let me see.  I'll go over.  And so I go over and knock on his trailer.  There's a, you know, they open the door, the PA knocks, there's a special knock, open  door and you lean in and I'm like, boss.  And they're here, huh?  And I'm like, fuck, he was sleeping.  Oh, I was like, I'm sorry.  Were you asleep?  He goes, I was Kev.  And I was like, oh man, I'm sorry.  He's going, well, I'm up now.  What's up?  I said, there's some, some rookies, man, just got their colors like not too long ago. 
[02:02:30]  And they're huge John McClane fans.  And you know, if you, I'll tell him to go away, man.  Cause you know, if you're sleeping and shit, the guy goes, just tell the police, hold down  to Florida.  I'll be out in a minute.  They came out and took pictures with him and shit like that.  Wow.  It is hard to say no to a cop.  It's really hard.  You know what I'm saying?  And also this was, and one of the dudes was, um, no, I ain't going to tell that story, but  it was very cool.  Now we need to know.  No, it wasn't.  It was something that it's not mine to tell, so I don't want to tell.  Officer Volpe? 
[02:03:00]  He was fucking, yeah, he was polishing his plunger.  But it was kind of cool to see, man.  It was like, you know, people like that dude.  But at least you don't, I like the fact that you don't seem like a fan boy at all waking  him up.  Hey Bruce, some guys want some pictures.  You want to come out and meet him?  But he's like, sure, we have to go.  All right.  I know, I felt a little bad for doing it, but come on, there are cops.  We really got to take a break, so.  Thanks for having us, man.  I'll see you Wednesday.  At Carnegie Hall.  Yeah.  Let's sell this fucker out.  What do you say?  There's only a few tickets left.  Under 500 at this point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's sell this fucker out for Kevin Smith. 
[02:03:30]  It's a big deal for him.  This is going to be fun.  Totally fun.  It's a blast, man, watching you talk about movies.  Just fucking, that whole thing you did, I watched the video when you were talking about  the giant fucking mechanical spider.  Yeah, that's amazing story.  In the Wild West.  That was hysterical, man.  It'll be fun.  It'll be interesting.  I can't imagine they're going to let me do it more than once.  I think they're just going to, after I do it once, you're going to be like, this is  Carnegie Hall, sir.  So come on out.  But you guys got to go.  All right, cool.  Yeah, let's take that well-needed break. 
[02:04:00]  Malcolm, thanks, man.  Thanks, Malcolm.  Thank you, guys.  Very cool.  See you soon.  See you again.  All right, let's go.  Steve will get your number.  We'll be back in a little bit.  All right, man, later.  Putting your nose in.  All right.  Obi, Anthony, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal.  What's happening here?  What's happening?  We're a little tired from last night, but we're doing it.  How did that go?  Can you slide over just a bit, sweetie?  It went well, but I don't even want to talk about that.  You had a great opening line when you opened that studio door, and I want you to reenact 
[02:04:30]  it.  Oh, when I came in?  Yeah.  I'll try to go back.  I know, I know.  It's a Stanislavski method, motherfucker.  I'm not a method guy.  I come out of the bathroom.  There's a pubic hair on the urinal.  Yeah.  On the urinal, and I'm looking at it going, I never understood pubic hairs on the urinal.  Like, does this mean somebody's fucking pubic hair is falling out while you're pissing?  Like, why is that there?  It fell out, motherfucker?  How does it just fall out?  It just fell.  It's just pubic hair there. 
[02:05:00]  You seem like you got to really tug those things to get them to come out, but...  But most guys, if they're zipping down, their dick comes out, pubes are behind, like, there's  another layer of clothing that the pubes are behind.  I'm holding the pubes in.  So you zip your...  And then when you pull your dick out, there's a hair ready to pop right out of that motherfucker  on the edge of the fucking toilet.  That shit is gross.  And I just thought of it while I was standing there, tired, because when you're tired, you  just be like, what?  You're just pondering things.  Like, you just accept it every other time in your life, but you just go, why is there 
[02:05:30]  fucking a hair right here?  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  You disgusted motherfuckers.  I don't get it.  What are you looking at?  Oh.  I don't know.  Well, anyway, how you guys doing, man?  How you guys doing?  Good to see you.  Really good.  Yeah.  Good to see you.  It is.  Good to see you, Patrice.  I mean, I don't take you guys for granted.  I never thought you did.  I don't take you...  I like seeing you guys.  I do.  I don't get to see you.  We call ourselves friends, but we don't see each other ever.  We're...  We're right again, Patrice.  But it's almost a great...  That's almost...  Look, I'm not...  Look, I'm not blaming you.  Did we have a good lunch?  No.  I'm not blaming you. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, that was a fantastic lunch.  We had a great lunch, and we're like, you know what?  We got to do this more often.  Why aren't we friends?  But then you tweeted our lunch.  I'd really, like...  Why are you tweeting our lunch?  The lunch became a fucking tweet.  Yeah, like...  I said...  Me and Opie are having a moment.  Because some guy...  Yeah.  Because, you know, a couple of kids was recognizing me in the street.  Couple.  Look at this fucking sick piece of shit.  Norton.  Swine flu.  Pandemic.  This bitch got fucking all kind of medicine he's putting in his nose.  Fucking...  I'm a bit under the weather. 
[02:06:30]  How about having some empathy for your friend and going, hey, I feel better, Jimbo.  Jimmy, when did that happen?  What?  You weren't sick yesterday.  I've been sick for a week.  I don't know.  I just don't complain about it.  He has no defenses.  I've been sick for a week.  I've got a guy that...  You have no...  My immune system fucking rules.  I never get sick.  You're missing an upper layer of your skin.  And you've got these girls shitting on your chest.  And you know that's just seeping right through your skin.  You have no...  I don't appreciate you attacking my upper epidermis.  I happen to have fine skin.  You need to wear bulletproof vests just to have the proper amount of skin protection. 
[02:07:00]  You fucking little worm.  Stop it.  I'm very healthy.  Let's get back to the Patrice story.  A very good immune system.  First of all, you're downplaying it.  This motherfucker got recognized every 10 feet.  It was ridiculous.  So the guy in Sbarro offered us free food.  And I go, come on, man.  We and Ope had a nice, delicious little...  They made us up some special stuff.  The Mexicans that were making the Italian food didn't want to...  They didn't want to make us up something special.  But the girl came over because the guy...  It was a whole thing.  Bippity-boppity-boppity-boop. 
[02:07:30]  That guy disappeared.  The family guy...  Bippity-boppity-bippity-boppity-bippity-boppity.  Bippity-boppity.  And he gave us some free food and this and that.  And we enjoyed it, man.  Had to sat down and...  Dude, I told you I was tweeting that fucking picture.  Okay, well, all right.  Patricia's like Moe Green.  Go on into Sbarro's.  You get what you want.  The dancers will kick your tongue out.  You can have pepperoni, sausage.  What he's not explaining properly, the guy that said, come on in and eat whatever the  fuck you want, disappeared.  So now we're trying to explain to the other people there. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, shit.  Like 20 minutes.  We're like, you know, the guy.  And then we're trying to explain what he looks like.  And everyone's like, who's it?  It might have been just another guy from the street.  And it was just some young girl that knew because he told her.  But I think his brother, he was just waiting to see if he was stealing.  And then it's like, you know, but we had a great time.  And you twitted.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah, you know what?  Twitting.  And then now.  You joined the Twitter universe, motherfucker.  That's right.  Well, I'll be leaving soon.  Mr. I don't want to be on the grid anymore is back on the grid. 
[02:08:30]  I'll be leaving soon as soon as the pylons start working.  I'm leaving this universe, motherfucker.  I already know it because I'm tweeting mean shit already.  Some fucker that knows me is tweeting me.  This kid's just like, hey, man, you going to do my show?  I'm like, don't you have my number, nigga?  Like, why are you not personally texting me, fuckface?  He wants your tweets to show up on his Twitter accounts and people think you're better friends than you are.  That's true.  I barely like him.  That's exactly how he probably knows that, too.  Fucking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar tweeting during the game. 
[02:09:00]  You're tweeting Kareem?  I tweeted him something.  He said something about the magic.  What do you think?  And I go, the magic going to fall like your hairline.  Oh, fuck.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  Twitch Shaq.  Kobe's.  You're going to be wondering how Kobe's ass tastes after this.  Fugface.  Because I've got to put F-U-G-G.  Fug.  Why fug?  Because you can't really swear.  You can't swear.  You can.  You can't. 
[02:09:30]  You've got to be nice on Twitter.  You don't.  Everybody's tweeting.  I fell down on the treadmill.  What do you?  Hey, guys.  A lot of that stuff.  I don't get it.  I don't Twitter a lot.  I don't either.  And if I Twitter, it has to be accompanied by a picture.  Because that's the only time I want to Twitter.  And it means something.  I'm hopefully get a picture with Hammer and tweet it.  Me and Hammer.  No, but you can take sometimes a twit without a picture if you just have a comment to make  is okay, too.  No.  Well, no.  I will excuse Jimmy Norton from the needing a picture thing.  Because Jimmy is very funny.  And I read his twits, his tweets, whatever the fuck you want to call them. 
[02:10:00]  And they are very funny.  Thank you.  He could just throw a line out there.  And it's funny because it's Jimmy.  But some of them are just inane, un-fucking.  I don't need to know this.  I don't need to know you're doing this right now.  I did tweet a picture recently, though, which is a very good photo and I tweeted.  Oh, yeah?  My photo of my friend Patrice.  Oh, okay.  But see, look, I'm a fan of a lot of things. 
[02:10:30]  Family Guy, for one.  So when Family Guy doesn't have new shows, I'm like, where the fuck are the new shows?  With these cocksuckers, I need my Family Guy.  Right.  I guess my self-esteem is not a place where I go, people need Patrice O'Neal shit.  I'm trying to get to that level where I go, okay, I'm trying to look at myself like other people.  I might look at other people where I go, I got to get my this fixed.  My, what's the sports show with Tony Kornheiser? 
[02:11:00]  You don't watch it.  Pardon the Interruption.  But I need my pardon the Interruption every day.  And Mike Wilbon and everybody got a call.  Everybody got the fucking H1N1 in this bitch, man.  Holy shit.  You know, that's a pandemic, you sick-ass motherfuckers.  Yeah, my immune system rules.  You know black people can't deal with these white viruses?  Niggas just sneezing swine flu everywhere, you dirty motherfuckers.  I'll tell you what happened.  We were sharing desserts last night.  Stinking-ass bastards just snorting up.  We were just passing desserts around.  I didn't care.  Taking a bite. 
[02:11:30]  I was already sick.  You know you motherfuckers are carriers?  We're the worst.  You know all the vaccines you give black people while fucking immune system's almost gone?  I need a tissue.  Leave us alone, man.  Give them a tissue.  Throw that shit to them.  God damn it.  Get that motherfucking some Buckleys or something.  I love Buckleys.  Sick bastards.  I think I'm having a stroke.  I said baskets.  Uh-oh.  I'm finished.  I started eating brown rice too late in my life.  How's your veganism?  Oh, it's good, man.  Except for now, I convinced myself to eat fish, but I'm getting back out of it. 
[02:12:00]  I just...  What's wrong with fish?  They cry.  They do.  They hurt.  They don't hurt.  Fish do.  Even though God bless God for creating them anyway, because there's nothing to make you  feel bad for them.  No.  Like lobsters.  You do boil them live, but they can't scream.  There's nothing worse than an animal that can't scream or blink.  Like, if you can't blink or make a sad eyebrow face... 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, you need eyebrows to look sad.  Or at least God should have made those claws be able to make a pray hand, like where it  looks at you...  Where he locks them together and just prays...  Black eye that's sticking up that doesn't...  That's just a globe on the stems.  And it just...  Please don't eat me.  Those black eyes on the little cherry stems.  They...  I think...  I think...  Like, all these books I'm reading about this veganism shit, they have the least reasons...  Like, fish has the weakest argument. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Because fish is only mainly because of mercury and all the stuff in the water.  Yeah.  You can't really get on the whole thing like fish suffer, even though they do.  But if you poke a fish, you can cut a fish live and it's doing the same exact thing as  it's doing...  When it's not...  God damn it.  Like, if I cut you, you'll scream like a monkey.  But if I start cutting you and you just was staring at me like...  Yeah.  You're not going to continue...  A fish will flop around, though. 
[02:13:30]  You're not going to continue...  Don't flop around if you just fucking...  You're not going to continue with your iPhone, is what you're saying.  Yeah, like...  Everything changes.  Yeah.  But not with a fish.  A fish, you just...  Your logic is better than...  You just chop that head off and the body...  It's just not an animal that you give a fuck about.  The head will continue breathing for a little bit.  Yeah, the...  It'll still be doing that.  The organs will move and shit.  They're just not a creature you feel bad for.  Yeah.  So...  But I start reading about that shit.  I'm trying to stay... 
[02:14:00]  You know, I mean...  The brown rice is now my thing.  I have to fight with...  Brown rice tastes like...  I've never tasted wood or shit.  But I know brown rice...  Wood and shit must taste like brown rice.  Brown rice...  You have to make it unhealthy to enjoy it.  Like, you have to put beef gravy on brown rice.  Or some type of gravy on brown rice.  Just to make it...  I don't understand why shit's gotta taste like shit.  Like, why... 
[02:14:30]  Why stuff that is really bad for you...  Thank you.  Why can't a sparrow just taste like a lobster?  Right.  Or a steak.  Or a fucking cake.  It's unbelievable, man.  You gotta think scientists are working on that.  Only shit that's bad for you.  You gotta think scientists are working on that, though.  They have been for years.  They did it!  They did it!  Low-fat stuff...  No, I mean, changing your taste buds somehow.  Model suit on your glutamate.  Model what?  MSG.  Yeah.  Is what...  It was...  That's what it was there for.  But they...  But it kills you. 
[02:15:00]  So everything kills you.  Yeah.  You know?  And everything that's really fucking bad for you is great.  Yeah.  It tastes good.  Fucking smoking feels good.  Things just like...  I went to P.F. Chang's and had a...  Ooh.  P.F. Chang's.  Fucking...  Nice.  A lava...  Some lava...  Lava cake?  Lava cake.  The chocolate lava cake.  Not the lava cake.  No, it's a chocolate.  What are you crazy?  It was a brick.  How was it?  Don't you have the diabetes?  Yeah.  And I just kind of... 
[02:15:30]  You just said, fuck it.  And you know what I ate?  I ate the top layer of icing.  Like, I peeled it off and it came off perfectly.  Like...  Like bread.  Like picking a scab?  It was just...  Yes.  It was just intact.  Hard icing.  And I took a little bit and then I washed it down with some blackberry, unsweetened blackberry  iced tea that they made back there.  To wash this down?  Wash that shit down.  And it was just delicious. 
[02:16:00]  And I had some tofu.  Tastes like ass.  Ass cheek.  And some fucking broccoli.  There's no need for tofu.  It sucks.  I'm so sick of broccoli and I'm so sick and...  So I eat a lot of fake like bokeh burgers and...  Those are okay if you cook them.  If you...  I like a bokeh burger well done.  What is that?  It's like a meatless burger.  It's delicious.  Vegetarian burger.  But you get tired of it.  The cheeseburgers, if you put some ketchup and mustard on those, it's good.  Some of the vegetarian burgers are good.  Yeah.  Bokeh burgers are delicious, man.  But, you know, I'm just... 
[02:16:30]  It's just trying to stay right.  I think I just chose too late, man.  Do you spray on your butter?  No.  I use this stuff called Earth Balance, but I probably use more than health.  Like, you know, healthy shit?  I think I use...  I eat six oranges.  I eat a half a watermelon all the day.  Just a half.  And I'm very meticulous.  I eat my watermelon.  I eat it.  I half it up.  Eat it, right?  And I scrape it.  And then I keep the juices at the bottom. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You make a little bowl out of it.  A big cup of giant watermelon juice.  I embarrass...  I embarrass the black people.  If you see me eat watermelon while I'm alone...  Like, here, if I order something, it's all chopped up.  If you see me eating watermelon, it should come with big eyes.  It should come with...  D.W. Griffin should be in there just...  Just going, mm, mm, mm.  And they mad at me for what?  It looks like a fucking 1920s poster for watermelons.  I'm telling you, I'm a complete pick-a-ninny when I'm eating... 
[02:17:30]  I am a fucking dirty slave when I'm eating watermelon.  I'm just...  It's that watermelon sound.  It's just...  That sound...  And it's all on my shirt.  I'm telling you, it's horrid if you see me eating watermelon by myself.  That video would do real well if you want to shoot it.  Fuck you.  Al Sharpton would fucking remove me from the annals. 
[02:18:00]  Obama would call me.  Nigga, what you doing?  What's up?  I'm like, man, it's just delicious.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You brought us back.  I'm president.  What the fuck are you doing?  I've been thinking about...  Sometimes I was sitting there and it'll be resting on my stomach, the watermelon.  And I've been thinking about, how bad is the rind?  Like, can you...  Is it really poison?  Can you eat it?  That's what I heard of it.  I just want to take a bite out of that fucking green rind.  You get too close, it tastes like cucumber.  What the fuck is not even that good?  It's not filling.  What is it?  Watermelon's not even that good.  I never liked watermelon.  It's the greatest fruit ever. 
[02:18:30]  I love it.  It's average.  It's fucking...  It's the only fruit...  Not even in my top ten.  You rub your hands like this, like...  I rub them together and go, I'm gonna...  Oh, shit.  This is a good-looking watermelon.  How about we don't look up watermelon pictures on the internet while I'm going to tell you this year?  But this Sambo thing, right?  This whole Sambo thing and shit...  I don't like how a delicious fruit has become the moniker of racism against...  I don't give a fuck.  Because the best way to eat it is just like a slave. 
[02:19:00]  I don't give a fuck.  Or not like a slave, because I bet you fucking slaves, because we don't know, I guarantee slaves ate watermelon with some class.  Like dainty, a little dainty.  I bet you, you know, the slave master just came and put that fucking knife down, nigga.  And they take pieces and they go, shove it in your face, quick, nigga.  And probably every bad eating habit we have is from slavery, because you get a 15-second break and they give you watermelon.  Ready, nigga?  Eat those...  Eat those pigs... 
[02:19:30]  The pig's feet?  Here's what we gonna do.  You've seen the Petey Green video by now.  Petey Green.  Hold on, let me pop this up.  God bless him.  God bless Petey Green.  This is the greatest video ever.  Petey Green's great.  Think twice before you answer.  Think twice before you say yes.  He shows you how to eat a watermelon.  I know y'all said yes and that.  Look at this fool.  God, this wasn't in here.  The reason why I said think twice is because...  Give me a little air. 
[02:20:00]  Give me a little air, y'all.  He's got newspapers.  The reason why I said think twice is because...  I just can't understand how we as black people started eating watermelon in the closet.  In the closet.  In the closet, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Lord have mercy.  It's called the heart.  Lord have mercy.  You know, it makes me feel so bad sometimes when I see my black brothers and sisters, and they'll see me eating a piece of watermelon like this. 
[02:20:30]  And they'll go to frown their faces.  I mean, that's insufficable.  But it's good.  And you know the thing that makes me mad?  When I go to their parties, they will take a big, pretty watermelon like this and cut all kinds of gadgets.  The little balls and shit.  Cut the inside.  You see this good piece of watermelon?  Cut all the guts out of that good watermelon and mix it up and mess it up with something else. 
[02:21:00]  Man, sometimes they got a notion of putting liquor in it.  And then after they cut them little credits in it, then put it back inside of that hood.  Man, that's a waste of watermelon when all you got to do with it is pick it up like this.  Look here, just pick it up like this.  God bless that motherfucker, man.  Man, I don't mess it up.  I ain't got to walk my heart in there.  That's a little bit. 
[02:21:30]  That's the way you want me.  Now, I don't care if you use a PhD, if you use a whatever.  You can't tell me cutting all that out, putting it back in there.  Yeah, I know.  They're sitting in here.  Now, I know you're sitting at home.  That's an ignorant nigga.  But this is a sweet watermelon.  I ain't going to waste no time cutting no watermelon up and mix it up with no food cocktail.  All I'm saying to you, be yourself. 
[02:22:00]  Because I went to a party over the night with some white folks.  They didn't have it in that thing there.  They had slices.  Walk around, Peter Green, you want a slice?  I said, yeah, give me a slice.  One lady said, I don't think, I didn't think you're blacks.  Eat watermelon like that no more.  I said, look, lady, don't try to get out on me, you understand?  You just want to eat the good part.  You want me to cut it all up and do it.  And then, you know, I was mad with niggas for putting salt on a watermelon.  Salt!  Fuck you, don't put salt on a watermelon.  Why y'all put salt on a watermelon?  Niggas were a man in my home saying, you know, I'm down there by the minute, Virginia. 
[02:22:30]  I said, let me tell you about salt, Peter.  He said, you watch the niggas put too much salt on.  I said, I watch you.  Them niggas dump salt on.  I said, you put a twang of salt on a sweet melon and it brings out like accent.  I said, what you say?  He said, man, I love watching people.  Y'all dump salt on it like you got chicken.  He said, but you just twang it.  I never knew that.  This guy's fantastic.  I just wanted to sit here this evening.  You ever seen the movie?  Talk to me?  I did.  With Don Cheadle playing him? 
[02:23:00]  That is the radio guy?  Yeah, Peter Green.  The radio guy.  Oh, shit, yeah.  The movie was great.  Cheadle was great in that movie.  Yeah.  You know y'all niggas put two sticks?  Don't do that.  You get one of them big roast nears, saturated with some butter, and hit that.  Be yourself.  And always remember that I got it off the vine.  It's sweet like honey, and I'll plug it all the time.  Say it back, y'all.  After you see this thing, it's good and crazy. 
[02:23:30]  Hold it for it.  I'll tell y'all just.  I'm telling you, dude.  That shit is.  Adjust the color in the table.  I can't understand what he says.  Leave yourself a slice of water, bro.  It's the closest thing to meat, man.  With Peter Green.  With Peter Green.  I don't even like watermelon that much.  I get a couple bites.  It's the closest thing to fucking meat of a fruit.  I don't like it.  You don't look forward to any other fruit like a watermelon.  I don't like it at all.  Peter Green.  I don't like it.  I mean, it's just like no other fruit. 
[02:24:00]  Maybe a pineapple if you feel in the mood.  Pineapple is a little.  But if you're in the mood.  Pineapple's like painful.  That's what you have to be in the mood for pineapple.  But no other fruit.  Blueberries stink.  Blueberries rule.  They fucking suck.  I love blueberries.  You know what blueberries are for?  It's a super food.  Being healthy.  It's just awful.  Try a blueberry.  I eat blueberries, but they've got to be a move for. 
[02:24:30]  They don't taste like fucking sweet fruit.  They're not delicious.  You put a lot of sugar on it.  You know what sucks, dick?  Fucking grapefruit.  I love it.  I don't get grapefruit either.  It's a bitter orange.  I like it a lot.  Give me a bitter, unsweet fucking orange.  You're eating the wrong grapefruit.  No.  Everyone says that.  The ruby red.  The Texas ruby red grapefruit.  No.  God damn it.  I can do a pity green video on the grapefruit.  You like grapefruit?  Bitter.  Love the grapefruit.  You can't love it.  It's for health.  No, not the regular one.  The fucking ruby red.  Jesus.  There's a few different versions of the ruby red. 
[02:25:00]  I'm telling you.  Get Iraq in here.  He turned me on to some Texas grapefruit.  That's all I think about now.  That's what y'all do.  Y'all just control our minds, man.  You would like it.  It's very sweet, eh?  I can't eat watermelon the way I want to.  You can't eat watermelon or chicken.  Chicken is our thing.  Enjoy chicken.  It's like everybody will just go, oh, yeah.  Murdering women is our thing.  All of a sudden, killing white women is ours.  But it's really yours.  Listen, listen, listen.  We're going to take a break because we've got to catch up a little.  Patrice is here. 
[02:25:30]  I want to get a little info out, though.  Patrice is playing comics tonight and tomorrow.  Dude, I went to the last time you were at comics.  That room is fucking perfect for you.  I enjoy comics, man.  Fucking, it's a great room.  And your fans are a little different than ours.  We have a, I think we share some audience.  We have, we have, here's what I like about you guys having me on the show for years.  There are, at first it was just all O&A.  Like, they would come to the show and be like, meh. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  But over the years, man, you've, the guys that come on, like the Vosses, the Mees, and the fucking Bobbies and everybody, Bill.  Everybody has their guys, their fans from this show that I'm going to see Patrice because I know what he does and I know what Bobby does.  Because no more all coming, which I don't fucking mind.  No, not at all.  I just don't mind that shit.  But you get the ones that like you coming.  I love that.  So it's my fans from other shit.  Like, the new fans that probably are most disappointed are the ones from The Office that saw me on a few episodes of them. 
[02:26:30]  And a lot of my WebJunk fans, I ran them out of town, too.  So it's a lot of tough crowd, a lot of just regular stand-up, and then a lot of O&A come to my shows.  You should see all the young kids that know Patrice O'Neal from that WebJunk.  When we were walking around after the last time we were on and we went and did the lunch, it was unbelievable.  Yeah, just young white kids from all over the country.  Freaking out.  They used to come to the shows when it first was on, be like 17 white teenagers. 
[02:27:00]  And I just go, you know, you know a rape is in your future.  And it's just like, oh, there you go.  Just get them out of there.  And you're a rock star in the black community.  Because after the show, it was just like, I mean, most of the audience when I went was black.  That's what I'm getting at.  And here's what I'm trying to tell you guys to stop fucking around, man.  A lot of black people love O&A.  You guys just don't care.  That's not true.  Stop.  Stop it.  Stop what?  Stop looking at sites like Nigger Mania. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, shit.  Look at it, he posts, he's an admin.  First of all, don't go on Nigger Mania.  When there's black people that fucking love.  Here's what they ask, black people ask, anytime I go somewhere.  Where do you think we just got the Petey Green video from?  Is Anthony really?  I go, yes.  But it's charm.  He's not Nigger Mania racist.  No, no, I'm not.  That's just it.  He's just, I have a black friend racist. 
[02:28:00]  You don't think I have to look at that end of the spectrum to appreciate the other end  of the spectrum?  What's the other end?  The other end of the spectrum is there are black militant sites that I go on also that  are amazingly racist.  Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?  It's like, I'm not saying that black people should be having those sites.  Well, mostly those sites are, they're crawling up as opposed to looking down, if that makes  sense, it's almost like you don't have any sites that go, you know, that go like this, 
[02:28:30]  like, shoo white people, like, that marginalize white people.  It's more like oppressor.  Now, not an excuse, but I'm saying white sites are just ridiculous with their horse shit.  Even though there's one part of it where I'll be fair, there's two things I've seen racist-wise  that I had to go, fuck.  One was, a guy made a YouTube video and they go, oh yeah, nigga, all serial killers are 
[02:29:00]  white?  And this son of a bitch made about a 10-minute video on black serial killers.  Oh, shit.  And to be a fair motherfucker, I go, well, motherfucker, they are niggas, serial killers.  Like, straight up, throwing a bitch in a dumpster, not just, like, shooting up outside  of a club, but hunting bitches and killing them.  We only know the one.  Randomly just killing.  Dude, it's, they kept showing, it was, so I had to appreciate this guy's tenacity of his 
[02:29:30]  racism, and the other thing he did, or not him, but, uh, niggamany, when I was looking  at it, it dispels all the black inventors.  I had, I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that he would not give niggas the stoplight.  Like, he wouldn't, he wouldn't give us the stoplight.  He's like, oh, Benjamin Banniger, oh yeah!  Well, here's what happened.  Here's what really happened. 
[02:30:00]  Peanut butter, suck my dick!  Charles Drew was Puerto Rican, like, he, he would not give us one invention.  Oh, shit.  Not one.  Not a one.  He dispelled them all, which make you have to go somewhere and actually do research.  Look at all the black serial killers.  That's a lot of black serial killers.  There was one guy in Virginia named Timothy Spencer, he was a black, uh, serial killer,  and he crossed racial lines, which most of them don't do.  Most serial killers kill within their own race.  He actually killed one.  Look at that cross-eyed motherfucker over there on the right. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, that guy.  I mean, some of these dudes, some of these dudes, uh, did some white guy shit.  Nobody did, did more, uh, than, uh, uh, BTK or the Green River Killer or, or, or, or  Henry, uh, Henry Lee Lucas or Otis Too.  White people are prolific with that shit.  But there's some guys that's in the same realm like that.  Cause you just go, but black people don't serial kill, but there was a few.  You know what I want to watch?  And, and it's pretty much the, the website is, is the only place to watch it. 
[02:31:00]  I like watching surveillance camera footage from convenience stores and, and it's fun  to watch.  I just like, I don't scare me actually, to be honest.  They just, the randomness of that.  That's what it is.  It's like a TV show.  Only it's real.  Six, six elderly women.  Like that's serial killer.  White one.  Oh, black serial killers.  I had no idea until today.  Invaded the home of five white teenagers.  Beat, raped, robbed, then killed.  Now that's an incident.  See that motherfucker.  Yeah, that doesn't seem like a serial killer. 
[02:31:30]  No, that's Texas Chainsaw Massacre right there.  Rafed and killed 13 women in LA.  That's a, that's just a serial killer.  Chester Turner.  Serial killer.  Wayne Williams, of course.  Yes.  Yeah, that's the only one I remember.  Damn.  Nice far, kid.  All right, how about Shelly Brooks?  Over six years.  Uh, killed seven prostitutes over a period of six years.  Yes.  Serial killer.  Because the BTK only killed seven people, really.  Or what, eight?  Oh, but.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, here's the cross-eyed guy.  Muhammad Omar confessed to the rape and killings of 16 women in Yemen. 
[02:32:00]  That's a fucking serial killer.  I think it's not even illegal over there.  In Yemen.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  That's like, we got to check Yemen's laws.  He was running for office, and that was his campaign platform.  Jesus, that's terrible.  Oh, shit.  All right, let's try Henry Lewis.  Henry Lewis Wallace.  Wallace.  Raped and killed nine women in Charlotte.  Serial killer.  Serial killer.  That's a serial killer, man.  Serial killer.  Absolutely.  That's a serial killer.  I mean, and, oh.  Holy shit.  Wayne Williams, 23.  That's Wayne Williams, yeah.  That's the one we know.  23 young boys. 
[02:32:30]  But Wayne Williams is not official, though.  Still to this day, people are like, Wayne Williams is not.  It's him.  What about Terry Blair?  It's about fiber and everything.  It's him.  Six women?  And then you have to get the circumstances, too.  Yeah.  Now, would you consider Richard Speck a serial killer?  A mass murderer, I think.  He killed those women at one time.  Mass murderer.  That's mass murderer, then.  I mean, Ted Bundy is prolific, also.  And I think it has to be over.  He's prolific.  Like, the best ones are white.  Yeah, yeah.  But there's some motherfucking 16, 12, strangle 12, Lorenzo Gillyard. 
[02:33:00]  That is a serial killer.  I don't understand why it's perceived that black people ain't serial killers.  Like, that are shit.  But I think that makes you seem smarter.  Wow, look at how you spun that shit around.  I think being a serial killer makes you.  Do you know how disappointed people were?  So we don't like promoting the intelligence of a serial killer.  I know what you're going to say.  The sniper, right?  The DC sniper.  And I used to do a joke about it.  It's like, when we thought he was white, he had the country gripped in fear.  Like, this guy, we thought he would build his own helicopter and fly away. 
[02:33:30]  And then...  And then come back someday.  And then, oh my God, we are in the grips of fear.  But it was just a nigga and his son in a Buick.  And caught him sleeping.  With a hole in the trunk.  Shoot a white person.  And bounce.  That's it.  And it makes you look...  I think a guy that gets away over the years of killing 20 women, 16 women,  takes some bit of intelligence.  Oh, when they fucking get him, like, on cold case files after 25 years, 
[02:34:00]  the cop knocks on your door and you're just like,  it was fucking 25 years ago.  Get out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  But, you know...  Like, BTK seems to be this sinister genius.  Yeah, yeah.  Gary Ridgway, who killed about 80 women.  He's only in jail for 50.  You know too much about serial killers.  It's interesting to me.  It is.  Very.  It's very interesting.  If I was going to do serial kill, I would definitely...  I would probably...  I would not kill black people.  I would go again...  I would read the profile books and I probably would have to kill... 
[02:34:30]  What would your thing be, though?  If you're a serial killer, you've got to have a thing.  What would your thing be?  Most of them are this hands-on...  Like, you know Gary Ridgway, right?  Right?  Gary Ridgway?  He's the Green River Killer.  He's the most prolific serial killer in the history of this country.  Almost officially.  He admitted to 80, but he's only in jail for 50.  The guy with a fucked up eye?  No, he's dead.  That guy.  That was Otis Toole.  Wait, interesting.  And that's the guy that killed...  Otis Toole.  John Walsh's son, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  He killed John Walsh from what you call...  The Green River Killer you're talking about?  His brother, I believe, was a guy...  There's a book called My Name is Steven, about a kid who was kidnapped for many, many years  and then he finally got home to his family and that was his brother.  I believe it was his brother became...  Was the Green River Killer.  Was the Green...  Gary Ridgway.  Okay, so how I would do it, you asked?  If I was going to do it?  But a lot of these guys are sexual.  It's all fucking a dead body afterwards and a lot of that creepy...  I don't know what it really is and it's like women are just things. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  And then that's why they kill prostitutes so they have no...  They're just things and shit.  I like the ones that sometimes pose them in provocative positions, the bodies, so that  when the cops find them they're like posed in these weird positions.  That's some...  That's shit that you can't just say, I'm going to be a serial killer and do that.  You have to be so fucked up in the head.  It's just too weird.  Like, I'm not that weird, but when I do daydream about killing...  Killing white people? 
[02:36:00]  It's definitely...  What's the guy?  The first mass murderer?  If I'm going to do...  The first...  He's considered the first mass killer.  Not serial killer, but the guy on top of the Dallas thing.  Oh, right, right.  Jesus, Charles Whitmore.  Whitmore.  Whitman.  Charles Whitman.  Whitmore is lost.  Right.  Whitmore.  Charles Whitman, like, just to go somewhere, and I just would think to have one of those  goddamn guns from Wanted.  You ever see that movie Wanted, where they were shooting bullets around the corner? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, where they swing the gun around.  Angelina Jolie?  Yeah, yeah.  Just one that can shoot from about two miles away.  And just...  Just...  Yeah, just...  Just...  Random.  And probably not even random people.  Gotta be people that made me...  That just remind me of things that make me sick.  Through the scope, you would look at them and go...  Ah, kill him.  Nah, leave him alone.  Nah, yep.  Just to play God.  No.  Play God right there.  Nah.  And then maybe go back to one that you said no, and shoot him anyway.  And just...  Nah.  Like, this guy...  Definitely... 
[02:37:00]  Definitely what seems to be the oppressor.  Definitely if I was caught that I was doing it, black people would probably...  Would say it was racially motivated.  No, black people would probably be...  Like, I'd be some kind of weird hero.  Yeah.  Where y'all would be like, why the fuck...  Why the hell shot they ain't saying nothing about this?  Like...  And just motherfuckers just sleeping on the ground.  Some fucking guy with his...  With the typical white guy.  I'm gonna...  In my head...  I'm looking at the guy, and in my head, I'm two miles away. 
[02:37:30]  He's going...  Doop-da-doop-da-do.  Doop-da-doop-da-do.  Doop-da-doop-da-do.  And I'm just like...  Just being a stupid white guy.  Or...  I'll definitely shoot somebody on a Segway.  Anybody on a Segway.  Fucking...  Traffic cop, maybe.  Meet-a-maid, maybe.  Yeah.  If I was, you know...  You could be the Segway serial killer.  The Segway killer.  There you go.  People would be afraid to drop their Segways.  That would be great, man.  Well, I mean, you dream about...  You have serial-killing thoughts.  Nah, not serial-killing thoughts.  Mass murder-killing thoughts.  I have home-invasion thoughts. 
[02:38:00]  Of kicking someone's door in?  No.  Oh, like someone comes in, and you're just ready for action.  Oh, a bunch of people.  It has to be a lot of people.  Oh, you would just fucking...  You can't just be one guy.  You're gonna kill one of your girlfriends by mistake.  No.  I know you are.  I am so fucking careful.  With a gun that's hooked against your forearm, and it comes out with some kind of...  Like a taxi driver.  Like a James Bond action.  Yeah, you're gonna do it.  I know you're gonna kill one.  By mistake.  I'm very safe.  No, I'm very safe with my firearms.  All right.  It's fantastic.  Very safe.  Let's break.  Yeah.  Because we really need to catch up. 
[02:38:30]  Patrice, so what I was trying to say, comics.  It's a great place to see Patrice.  Friday and Saturday.  212-524-2500.  And I'm tweeting now.  Well, yeah, give the name, because everyone wants to start following you.  Oh, boy.  It's Big B-I-G Mama M-O-M-M-A Prods, as short for Productions.  Oh, shit.  Big Mama Prods.  Patrice O'Neal's gonna slowly disappear.  That's it, huh?  Big Mama M-O-M-M-A Prods.  He's always onto something when he comes in here. 
[02:39:00]  Producer now.  I am going to slowly drift away.  Slowly drift away.  Into Big Mama Production.  All right, quick break.  We'll continue.  Oh, you know what?  F.U. Line.  It is Friday.  Let's get this out there.  The people are calling the F.U. Line.  Oh, one more thing.  Like, crazy show.  One more thing, Hope, about the Twitter.  Yeah.  The reason I called it that is because I had the funny idea that I was famous enough  that somebody would have stole Patrice O'Neal.  But no one did.  Oh, man.  It was completely free and open.  Not even someone that grabbed and just has a tweet that says, Patrice, I'm holding this 
[02:39:30]  for you.  I don't even fucking know, man.  Oh, shit.  I'm just Big Mama Prods.  If they did, they did me a favor, but it's open.  All right, cool.  Sons of bitches.  Hey, I did that good.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal at Comics this weekend.  Good morning.  Thank you.  I am at Comics.  Friday and Saturday.  Trying to get the energy up.  Not Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice O'Neal.  Just Patrice O'Neal Comics.  C-O-M-I-X.  Yeah, he's saying I'm here.  He goes, Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neal is at Comics. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I got it all.  Patrice is at Comics.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  Down in the meatpacking district.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-0.  Yeah, you're talking over your own fucking gun.  Sorry.  Do that number again.  I'm sorry.  How the fuck are you supposed to get people there?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Here's little Nicky.  Come on.  Hi, little Nicky.  Let all Nicky.  Can you give me to me one more time?  Hi, little Nicky.  Hi, little Nicky.  All right.  We'll give Patrice's info.  And Patrice is also Twittering Big Mama Prods.  And I see a lot of basketball talk on your Twitter.  I was watching last night, my friend. 
[02:40:30]  Did you watch it?  I should have.  A little bit?  You filmed Jimmy Fallon, what, like five?  Yeah, but we went downtown and celebrated.  We had one of those rare moments where me and Ann were hanging out,  and we were bonding, and we were drinking, and all sorts in the bar.  Yeah, I feel listening to the show, man.  You guys have fucking recreated a love affair from years back.  I feel it like this is like 1982 again.  82?  What are you going to do?  Fucking, it's amazing.  Ups and downs.  We got the big ups right now.  It flies by, my friend. 
[02:41:00]  We got the big ups right now.  It flies by.  I did not watch the game.  Free radio, stunk.  Now y'all are fucking just flowing like a motherfucker.  It does stink, doesn't it?  We brought a lot of people over to here, and now we're building from here.  Absolutely.  And you can feel something in the air.  I'm not just saying that.  I listen to the show.  You can feel it.  But I go sit in my car, and I turn that motherfucker on at about 6.30 and listen.  I just want to say really fast.  Why can't you?  NBA Finals.  Yes, sir.  I want to focus for a second.  NBA Finals. 
[02:41:30]  I claim to be a sports fan, and then I let everyone down with my knowledge.  But I just don't feel like...  I watched here and there, but I wanted the big LeBron James, Kobe Bryant.  Well, why would you invest?  First of all, Cleveland...  Dwight Howard is a bust.  He's not a bust.  Cleveland...  He's a bust.  They're trying to make him a superstar like the rest of the guys.  He's not.  He's a bust.  He's just below those guys.  He's a bust offensively.  He can't...  He has no go-to move.  He's...  See, they compare him to Shaq, but Shaq had go-to moves.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Shaq was so good at dunking on you.  That was his sky hook.  Fucking...  He's a little clumsy.  His hands ain't great.  This is Dwight Howard.  He can't shoot free throws.  He's just a rebounding and blocking machine, but he can't score.  He's a liability at the end of the game.  And another thing that's a liability is they don't have a Kobe.  As much as I don't like Kobe, just because I don't.  I never met him.  He might be a good guy, but I just don't like the guy. 
[02:42:30]  Why don't we like Kobe?  Because he seems like an elitist goosebath.  Because I'm the same...  You feel like he's a liar.  You get the inclination he's a liar.  He's just...  You just don't...  Like, he seems like you shouldn't like Kobe.  It's like he got tattoos after he got that rape beef.  If he had to took it...  That rape beef, he had to just took it in the chin.  I think snitching on Shaq when he was like, but Shaq cheats on his wife, too.  I think when he did that, people just didn't like him.  And then when he brought his wife a $4 million ring, as opposed to going,  Hey, bitch, it is what it is. 
[02:43:00]  Because you can't be an NBA player.  You can't be worth...  And it is.  I talk to my girl about this.  You can't be worth $100 million.  And you get side pussy, and your girl...  It's like, shut up, bitch.  I'm Kobe.  Like, you can't...  She's happy to be in the light.  I think that she waits for him after every game, gives him a big kiss, and the kids...  You get the feeling like it's all contrived, like to say,  Hey, we need to be loved again.  Right, right.  And you just feel like he's full of shit. 
[02:43:30]  You feel like it.  He could be a nice guy, but on the front end, you feel like he's full of shit.  You just feel...  But it's also because Shaq is a likable guy, and there's no...  Everyone likes Shaquille O'Neal, and he hates him, and he played with him.  And if you get Shaquille O'Neal to hate your guts, you're probably a douchebag.  Yeah, but Shaquille is an ass, too.  Like, he does fucked up things and says fuck...  Like, his thing is he wants everybody to look at him like he's the godfather of the league.  And sometimes there's...  When you got alpha males, it's like you can't be an alpha male and always want other people to be, like, praising you. 
[02:44:00]  And then you're an asshole because...  And Kobe said, go fuck yourself to him.  He said, I'm a bad motherfucker, too.  Fuck you.  And Shaq's like...  You know, you say something about him.  He flopped.  Dwight Howard...  This is the thing with Stan Van Gundy.  He flopped.  Dwight Howard hit Shaq, and Shaq flopped.  He fell. 
[02:44:30]  And the flop is just falling when you don't need to fall.  Yeah, I've seen that.  And Shaq flopped.  And Stan Van Gundy called him out, and he's like...  Then he starts going on Van Gundy.  He's a poser.  He's a...  He's a...  What do you call him?  He's the captain of panic.  And he just started going in like he talked about the nigga's mama.  You know, like...  It's like you did flop, motherfucker.  You did.  You big...  You're 387 pounds.  You fell for no reason.  You can say that.  But Kobe fucked up. 
[02:45:00]  He would have been liked if he just kept his big mouth shut.  Now he's just trying to repair.  You see that?  The Spike Lee thing, where it's like they filmed him, and he was just...  What was it?  Like Kobe doing work.  And the whole thing was Kobe talking and relating to his teammates and giving him advice and laughing.  It's like, yeah, that's not you, you motherfucker.  He's playing a role.  Yeah, you're bullshitting.  People like LeBron because they feel like LeBron is genuine. 
[02:45:30]  But LeBron fucked up this time because he didn't shake.  He left the court.  He was bummed.  He had a temper tantrum, man.  And that wasn't good for him.  Well, he thought he was going to win it all.  But also, he was playing with a massive tumor in his mouth.  Yeah, he had to remove some shitty thing in his mouth.  Yeah, it was a nice-sized tumor.  And I think you could see it through the jaw.  Yeah, it looked like he was, like, doing chewing tobacco or something.  Yeah, his face was like a mini driver's face.  Yeah, but I mean, the Lakers and the magic. 
[02:46:00]  I wanted Lakers Cavaliers.  By the way, someone who's a Howard fan says 40 against Cleveland.  No offense.  You know what?  40 against Cleveland.  Here's the thing.  Kobe and LeBron are the two best players in the league.  I put Kobe a little drop ahead of LeBron because Kobe is polished.  LeBron is pure.  He's a prodigy.  Great way to say it, man.  But Kobe is a polish.  You can count on Kobe, his 40 every night. 
[02:46:30]  LeBron can score a weird 50 or a really strange 29.  But Kobe drops a pretty consistent 35 all the time.  Same way every time, too.  All the time.  Just really good player.  Dangerous.  I love LeBron, though.  Is he the best player in the league right now, Kobe?  I think Kobe is.  I used to say LeBron is.  Because LeBron is the best.  He's like, if you go, what would you make a basketball player?  He's 6'8", 270, runs like a reindeer, flies like an eagle, and he's a bad motherfucker. 
[02:47:00]  He's unstoppable.  But Kobe is just a machine, man.  He's a basketball machine.  I have to give it to him, and I don't like him.  But his game is nice.  Same polish is perfect.  He's a polished guy.  Dwight Howard against Cleveland, you got to understand, man, it was LeBron versus the  Orlando Magic.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  LeBron James versus the Orlando Magic. 
[02:47:30]  And they won two out of six with one guy.  LeBron needs a Scottie Pippen.  He needs more than a Scottie Pippen.  Even more than a Scottie Pippen.  Because look at Kobe has Gasol, who's no joke.  Paul Gasol is a bad, bad motherfucker.  Trevor Reeves is 6'9".  That's another thing.  Cleveland had 6'1", guards defending Rashard Lewis's 6'11 ass, who shit the bed last night. 
[02:48:00]  Played like a fucking ass.  Six points?  Who the fuck?  Let me tell you something, man.  If I'm 6'11", I'm 6'4".  And if I'm playing against somebody 5'11", I'm winning.  I'm scoring.  Kobe's 6'6".  He's a monster.  Rashard Lewis doesn't disappear.  And then they put little fat, um...  What's that little fat motherfucker? 
[02:48:30]  Uh, what's the little fat dude?  Nagle?  Nelson!  Nelson!  Fucking...  What is that?  Jameer Nelson!  They took Skip to Malou out.  Who was fucking killing him?  Stan Van Gundy's dumb!  They lost that.  They lost that game.  He's a weird coach to look at.  Oh, he looks...  And listen to.  He's an asshole.  He looks just like...  I'm not letting fucking Mario brother...  Ron Jeremy is not to coach me on basketball. 
[02:49:00]  Just a sweaty little man.  He just looks like he should be delivering bread.  We'll move on, but my one thing about the NBA that bothers me and worries me...  All the guys have neck tattoos.  How are they going to get jobs after the NBA is over for them?  Unless they spend it all on cocaine, they're a $100 million contract.  But the neck tattoo is really popular in the NBA right now.  I don't like it either.  I think I'm becoming just too...  I think it's an age thing.  The older I get, the more...  That's starting to look scary. 
[02:49:30]  It used to be all racism to me when I was younger.  But the more...  The older I get, the more I'm going,  These kids.  What is with this awful tattoo on your neck?  Do you know what a commitment that takes?  And do you know what an asshole you look like in a suit?  With a tat on your neck?  When there's an entire...  There's a saying?  And enough of your fucking tattoos that's supposed to mean something.  Stop with your writings that say,  Hey, I died and came alive. 
[02:50:00]  Just go fuck yourself.  So what?  Your third cousin got shot.  So now I got to look at his...  I got to look at his fucking face with his date of death and birthday.  Give me a fucking break, man.  Stop.  I'm bummed that my dad died,  but I wouldn't want a tattoo.  A tattoo of Obie's dad?  Like, I'm looking at your arm like,  Who's that?  With the years he was alive?  And it's kind of warped?  It's not quite...  No, I don't want that.  It's not quite done right?  I don't want...  Like, half the face is drooping.  I don't want to see that in the bathroom every morning 
[02:50:30]  after I take a shower.  Fuck that shit.  Here's where my mom died.  Hell no.  Her face on my forearm.  You know what, though?  To remind me of what?  But in all fairness,  it helps the people out there.  Does it?  It gives them some kind of comfort.  Me, not so much.  That would creep me out.  Nah, you just don't need it.  That would creep me out.  Not on your neck either.  And then I'm getting tired.  Just tattoos...  Everything is lost.  It's...  Nothing.  Everything.  Yeah, you just...  How do you be a rebel now?  There's just no way to do it.  They just...  By doing no piercings and no tattoos? 
[02:51:00]  I think I would have had the body.  I think my shape is the thing that made me nod.  Prevent you from getting a tat?  Yeah, because I have any belly button.  It's just deep.  So I would...  I'd probably make it a mouth or something.  It's just...  Tattoo like a little well around it.  Yeah, like a...  I got stretch marks.  I was going to put numbers around it,  like make it a little map.  Other than that,  I have nothing I need to represent.  Like, you know,  a couple of guys I know have the comedy tragedy...  Ah!  You know, to say...  You don't like that, Jimmy?  No, you know. 
[02:51:30]  The comedy tragedy tattoo?  You don't like that tattoo?  I'm in this shit for real, motherfucker.  That's fucking horrendous.  Nick DiPaolo has that.  I love Nick, but God almighty.  He must have got that his first year.  Oh, just to say...  Hey.  Yeah.  This says I'm in it for good.  Really?  Does it?  Auschwitz?  Take your fucking brand of what you do.  You know, Auschwitz...  That's true.  You don't see Garbage Man with that,  like fucking...  With a truck with a bunch of fucking bags in it.  That's what I do.  That's who I am.  That's who I am.  The radio guys? 
[02:52:00]  Microphones.  Microphones.  Why?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Microphones.  It's embarrassing.  Nah, you don't want to.  Stop.  But the worst tattoo of them all,  I have to say,  Kenyon Martin has a tattoo of his girlfriend's lips.  She kissed something, I guess,  a piece of paper.  They drew it,  and he had it tattooed on his neck.  Oh, shit.  And it makes me sick.  That's lame.  It's just...  At least put it on your dick.  It's just...  Pronounced love gestures sicken me. 
[02:52:30]  It's just fucking fickening me.  Why, Patrice?  Just be some flowers, bitch, and a check.  Like, please.  You're not a romantic, are you?  Nah, man.  Because, you know...  Girl listens to our show every day, though.  Oh, my girl's a soldier, man.  She loves all this shit.  She just...  She loves it.  She keeps me...  She got me into Twitter a little bit.  She's helped me a lot with it.  Like, she's, like, really into going,  good morning, twit family. 
[02:53:00]  Ugh.  Oh, look at her dumb tweets.  Hi, Twitterers.  You know?  Says hi to her tweets.  I'm not too...  Aren't they called tweets?  I don't know what they...  Twitterers.  It just gives her a friend,  and I don't want to do anything  to stop her friendship from anyone.  It's just...  She's so happy to be friends with somebody,  because I'm such a bad friend to her.  You know?  All I have enough is to be her man.  But she...  We had a big argument the other day,  because she helped me start my Twitter.  And then the girl next door,  Angela Yee,  who does the Shade 45, 
[02:53:30]  she helped me, like,  really put the Twitter together  and got me a bunch of friends.  Like, all these friends is like...  She started it.  So I was, like, giving her credit.  Like, girl, right.  Man, you're the best.  Oh, damn.  And my girl's like,  you didn't help me.  What does that mean?  And you didn't tell me.  And I'm like, bitch,  you're in my life.  You're supposed to help me  with my fucking Twitter.  Because you're supposed to  wash my dishes tomorrow.  That's your job.  And Zach, your job is to help me  do shit.  And my job is to help you do shit.  So shut the fuck up, asshole.  Let me jump in.  I don't want to lose this phone call 
[02:54:00]  talking about tattoos.  Here we go.  Tim in Wisconsin.  Tim.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Tim.  You guys were talking  about tattoos earlier.  My cousin,  she got pregnant  by her boyfriend.  I'm sure it wasn't planned.  But she ended up tattooed...  Or she got a miscarriage.  So she tattooed the baby...  What the baby's name  was going to be  and some dates  on, like, her arm  or something.  What did she present?  What were the dates?  Five o'clock  dash 530? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh, damn.  Talk about wanting  to be a victim, you know?  Wow.  Yeah, that's like...  Why would you want  to be reminded  of something like that?  That's just pathetic.  She just wants  to be a victim.  She wants people  to ask about it?  You know what?  You make a good point.  People do want  to be a victim.  I respect faded out tattoos.  Thanks, Tim.  You know, you get some guy...  Old Navy guys.  Some merchant marine  with a fucking  pair of tits on his arm  that faded.  Yeah, the fucking...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, the tits  are wopsided,  one small  and big in another. 
[02:55:00]  A big blue blur.  A mermaid with tits.  Some bitch  with a fucking  butterfly on her ankle  just to say  I'm a little bit crazy.  Well, the guys...  Get the fuck out of here.  The guys that got  their tattoos  in a port overseas  instead of getting  it at the local strip mall.  When you would drive...  I respect that.  Right?  ...in the way you do.  Oh, I got this  when I was in fucking Hong Kong  or whatever the fuck.  I remember this one.  Right.  I mean, you know,  you can get tattoos.  I'm not against them,  but it's just like you've...  Now, you can't get them.  If you're somebody  trying to just 
[02:55:30]  make a statement,  it's just easy  to be...  That's why I respect  old gay guys  because they were gay  before...  When it was a bitch.  I think it's almost cool  to be a gay guy now.  Like, it's almost like...  You see...  No one fucks  with gay guys now.  Remember when you used  to see, like,  two guys holding hands?  It would be like,  what the fuck?  What the fuck?  You don't...  You don't...  You see it more and more now  where you're not doing  the what the fuck  turning your head  fast move anymore.  I respect two old...  Like, I respect  Miss Jane Hathaway  lesbians. 
[02:56:00]  Just some old dyke  who just...  Was she a lesbian  on that show?  Oh, well...  Well, we all knew.  She was a lesbian.  I think she was  after Jethro all the time.  I think it's too easy  to be everything now.  It's just too easy  to be everything.  Like, you know what I mean?  So I'm...  Make a point there.  Where do you go?  Like, that's why  I go fuck Twitter.  But what am I doing?  I'm gonna be a modder?  Like, I'm gonna be  the guy who doesn't do it  and no one cares  until I'm dead?  Yeah, you're the one  that doesn't do it.  Everyone else is doing it. 
[02:56:30]  And no one cares  that you don't do it.  Exactly.  Like, your rebellion  means nothing.  I'm just a lonely fat guy  with no Twitters.  What the fuck is wrong  with that woman?  That's the...  Oh, it's digitized?  Holy shit.  What happened, it?  Like, I'm just looking  at that woman's face  but it's all digitized  because...  Sarah Palin looks  fucking smoking hot.  She lost weight.  Oh, be Twitter me, man.  So I can...  They fucking...  I'm gonna follow you.  They gussied her up.  She looks great.  She was too good looking  so they fucked with her  so people would vote for her 
[02:57:00]  and not think, you know,  hey, she's not this bimbo.  No, it's just a bad thing  because she's talking  to this bitch.  They're going after  fucking Letterman still, man.  Well, she is.  No, but now there's  the woman's group.  Where are we at with that?  Going after...  Hold on a minute.  What?  Well, women's advocacy group  wants an apology from Letterman  for the Palin joke.  He made a couple of...  He made a mistake.  He made a joke about...  I think she had brought  her 14-year-old daughter.  He made a couple of jokes  about her.  One, her daughter was like a hooker 
[02:57:30]  and that she got knocked up  by A-Rod and she's...  Funny material about that.  I heard...  She's fucking fuming.  In an era, it may have been  a bad judgment choice,  but it was funny.  Yeah.  And it has context to it  because her other daughter  is a fucking...  is an unwed fucking mother.  Well, they're focusing on the fact  that the wrong daughter  was in town,  but if you're like a joke writer,  you know, for Letterman,  Palin's in town.  Okay, what can we do with Palin?  That's all they're thinking.  They're not looking at 
[02:58:00]  the itinerary and saying,  oh, she's here  with the younger daughter.  But they're discrediting...  It says Palin material  they're going for in general.  They're discredited  because they went after Obama  for the retard thing on Leno.  And I'm like,  eat my ass.  Like, why would you...  I'm not going to fall  for that banana  in the tailpipe, man.  I'm not going to be upset  when retard doesn't mean  some fucking kid who...  You know, it doesn't mean  Simple Jack.  It means, dude, you're a dick.  It means I'm a dick.  I'm an asshole when I bolt.  Yeah, you're fucked something up.  You're a retard.  Look at this one. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, oh, fuck.  What was the headline?  There's a 700-pound bitch  on TV right now.  I know, but you've got to see  what the story's about.  A girl...  Five days because of brutality...  Yeah, but they just showed  the crime, and I can't remember now.  She was beat up, burned...  Burned with cigarettes or something?  And then they cut her hair off  in a Chicago part.  Oh.  Face and scalp were burned  with cigarette lighter.  Are these the girls that did it,  or are these the girls  that had happened?  It must be the ones.  Look at her,  this big, fat, lonely girl.  She probably got beat up.  It's amazing what they're  not pointing out, though.  Oh, okay.  Is it racial? 
[02:59:00]  No, it actually might be...  Oh, some black girls?  White and black beaten her up.  I can't tell.  I can't tell.  That skinny one, boy,  is on top of this big mule.  And they just cut her hair.  What'd she do?  I don't know.  Probably just was her.  You know, was her.  But the thing is this,  when David Shuster made his comment  about Chelsea Clinton,  and they crucified him for it,  he got suspended for two weeks,  and he should not have  gotten in trouble for that,  and it's just the same thing  happening to Letterman.  It's like...  You know what?  It's great for business.  Yes, I know, though.  If he can hang in there. 
[02:59:30]  This is a rough one.  Letterman will survive it.  He's going to have to say something.  Oh, he did.  He did say you're sorry.  No, I know,  but that wasn't enough  because they're still going after him,  so he's going to have to say something.  His apology...  If David Letterman didn't say...  Shut up.  He sort of did.  How fast would that go away?  It wouldn't.  I'm telling you,  because she's being...  She's Sarah Palin, first of all,  and she's being vocal.  What does that mean?  She gets a lot of media coverage.  She can get the media coverage  whenever she wants.  Not anymore,  and she's irrelevant.  It's Letterman.  But look at her.  They're talking on fucking the Today Show.  They have nothing else to talk about. 
[03:00:00]  So I'm saying,  she can get media coverage.  She can get media coverage  and she can complain  and there's enough people who like her  who don't like liberals.  What is she asking?  I don't know,  to be honest with you,  but I'm saying there's enough people  that like her and a Republican  that would fucking kick it up a storm.  But what is she...  Is she coming on just going like...  Is she going,  David should do this  or she's just going,  oh, that was...  I heard her thing was like,  oh, that was...  That wasn't right,  Mr. Davey Letterman.  And then like,  what does she want now?  I don't know what she wants, 
[03:00:30]  but she's still...  She's attacking him  and she's saying that he was implying  he wanted to have sex  with a 14-year-old,  which is obviously not true.  But the bottom line is  to hear that from someone  who is just a vice presidential candidate  is fucking damaging.  Why wouldn't somebody on the news say,  get over it,  get a hold of yourself, bitch?  Because if somebody made a sex joke  about Michelle Obama  or a fucking hook,  called her a hooker,  there would be a fucking outcry  and she's an adult.  She is not...  You are not hearing  any Michelle Obama-ness going on.  Except by the fucking kid.  That's the only one  who makes fun of her. 
[03:01:00]  Who's the kid?  Me.  Did you refer to yourself  in the third person  and not your name, you dick?  Well, I...  Of course I made fun of her.  What does the kid say?  I made fun of her on Letterman.  Her dumb eyes.  Oh, I made fun of her  on Red Eye.  Yeah, but...  I know.  Nobody is really fucking with her.  They used to fuck  with Hillary's ankles.  They used to fuck  with the fact that, you know,  she had a lot of pressure on her.  And also Sarah Palin,  they ruthlessly dogged this bitch. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  And no one really...  Do you think Palin's  going to be a player?  No.  No way.  The Republicans are leaving her.  No.  Of course not.  She's goofy.  She still gets a lot of coverage.  They attacked her  because she's hot  and she's against abortion.  She's like a conservative Republican,  which just really annoyed people,  I think.  I got to go to the phones again.  Another tattoo story.  Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Hey, it's John.  Well, I'm like,  I don't want to bring the show down,  but I'm like a walking memorial  for my wife.  What happened?  We ended up losing...  We lost technically 
[03:02:00]  five babies in one year.  Jesus.  How?  My whole back is tattooed up.  What did she have?  Septuplets and she miscarried?  How did you lose five babies?  She had quadruplets  and carried them for six months  and they lived for like an hour.  And then the first baby  she lost after three.  And now you got all these  dead babies on your back?  Jesus.  No, he's saying it.  But now do you have kids too?  Do you have other kids?  Now I have a set of twins.  Wait a minute.  So you guys are doing that  like turkey baster stuff, huh? 
[03:02:30]  Yes and no.  It was a lot of medicine, but...  Now, do you got little faces  on your back?  No, I wanted to get that done.  Oh.  No, I got tall crosses.  Oh, my.  You got a little cemetery  on your fucking back.  And that's just...  And can I ask you a question?  What is that for?  Like, what is the absolute  ending purpose for that?  It's just...  It's not like closure.  It's just, you know,  it's just something that  reminds you to keep going. 
[03:03:00]  Hey, you can't...  And plus, look,  I don't know what it's like  to lose a baby.  So it's like you're...  You're kind of bringing them  with you everywhere you go  in a weird way.  It's not...  You know what I mean?  It's like, yeah,  they're still here in some way.  Yeah.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Yeah, who are we to say?  If it helps you out...  Yeah, if you lose a kid,  that's fucking...  No, I'm not judging it.  It's just like,  why do you do it?  I could just say for myself  that would be rough to do,  but, I mean,  if it helps people to,  you know, move on  or move forward or whatever...  They'll feel better.  You can't get a tattoo  for everything, you know?  No, like,  now that the two that are living,  I got their footprints 
[03:03:30]  in a special way, you know?  I have to get their actual...  Enough with your fucking tattoos!  You get something fun  next time, sir.  Yeah, go for a fun tattoo.  Get a...  Get like a skull.  How about a mermaid  blowing a demon?  Something silly.  Christ, I'm a pony.  Get a coin.  I might get a wow sticker.  I might get a wow sticker  tattooed to me.  Good boy.  Don't.  Now we're talking.  I've seen a couple of tattoos  of my signature,  which was very odd.  Guys have had me  sign their arms,  and they sent me a photo  of the tattoo  that they got  with my name sign.  You fucking secretly  love that, too.  I love that idea.  Who wouldn't?  Fucking egomaniac.  I think it's crazy. 
[03:04:00]  But it's bizarre.  It's bizarre.  It's bizarre.  It's not a tattoo.  It was just a Sharpie.  No.  They didn't.  Come on.  No.  You gotta sit through the pain.  You gotta sit through the pain.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  I want someone  to tattoo my name  on their face.  Ten bucks.  And the thing is,  somebody might do...  You know, you hear it  and you go...  And somebody has  that kind of shit on them  and they go,  you think that's...  It's like, look, man,  that's for you.  Yeah.  Like, don't force me.  Let me tell you something.  You show me...  If you show me his back  to make me feel, 
[03:04:30]  I'd be like...  All he can expect  is lies for me.  Like, oh, yeah.  And I'd be trying  to figure out  how long to...  It's like,  that's your fucking  situation, man.  Damn, that's...  It ain't got nothing  to do with empathy  or anything.  It's just,  what the fuck  do you want me to do?  Is that real?  What is it, Ant?  A tattoo.  This cruddy bitch  with a dick on her chest.  And it says,  dick sucker.  She's probably a hooker.  A dick going right  up her cleavage. 
[03:05:00]  What a cruddy mistake  that is.  Up to her neck.  And black people  gotta be very careful  with our tattoos  because of keloid  and the fact  that we can't get  those good colors.  The fact you're dark  with dark ink.  Yeah, they all look  like gel tattoos  because it's dark.  What the fuck?  Can they get white ink?  Why can't they get  white ink?  It doesn't work very well.  I think it comes up  gray or something.  How about they fix it?  The color doesn't...  They can make a dick  a pussy.  Jesus Christ.  Let me see that 
[03:05:30]  horrible one, Danny.  Let me see that  favorite.  That's my favorite  horrible tattoo.  Look at this guy  in loving memory.  Look at the picture  of it and look  at the horrible job.  What did she die?  A demon?  That is terrible.  They don't know  how to do teeth  and tattoos.  Some people  are really fucking good  at doing portrait tests.  That's because...  But the teeth  fuck it up.  That isn't an example  of somebody that's good.  Nobody wants to see  flesh-colored teeth.  Flesh-colored teeth  give everyone the creeps  with dark outline. 
[03:06:00]  My teeth are flesh-colored.  Nobody wants skin teeth.  Let me go to Kat.  Kat, what's up?  Hey, I was watching  the Today Show today  and Sarah Pollan  was saying that  she was upset  because this is  lowering the self-esteem  of young women today.  But as I remember,  I had low self-esteem  in the 90s.  My mom had low self-esteem  in the 60s.  And I'm sure if I ask  my grandma or great-grandma,  they had low self-esteem  back in the 1800s. 
[03:06:30]  So I don't know  why Sarah Pollan  is trying to make  everything seem so rosy.  Well, it's like this.  You can't blame  Sarah Pollan  for sounding off  about this anymore.  I don't like Hillary,  but I didn't blame her  for trashing MSNBC.  You know, when it's  your daughter,  you kind of got the right  to talk a lot of shit  about it.  I don't, you know.  Hillary, I felt the same  way when Hillary did it.  Yeah, but the thing is  that she's saying  rape jokes are the reason  why girls are having  low self-esteem.  And you know what?  I'm sorry.  Anything to do with rape,  it's a joke. 
[03:07:00]  Laugh at it.  If you're not going  to laugh at it,  you're going to cry about it.  Can I ask you a quick question?  You know what?  Pollan should speak her mind,  obviously, and then just move on.  I mean, what?  You want Letterman fired  or something?  Can we discuss this  really quick for like a minute?  No, I'm not saying you.  I'm just generalizing.  Like, what does she want  in the end?  You know, she didn't  like the joke.  All right, speak your mind,  get your point out,  and that's it.  That's how it should work  in America.  Can I say this?  End of story.  Is this you, Kat?  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Hi, how are you doing?  Good.  Who's Kat?  I don't know Kat. 
[03:07:30]  I'm the abortion doctor.  Abortion doctor.  Oh, the good egg.  She was up in the studio.  Can I ask a...  Can you tell me why...  Back in the...  When we used to have  live audio.  Why women?  Just really, why do they...  Why do they suck?  Why do they suck?  Like, why are they just not...  There's not one that you go,  this bitch is a bad...  Like, dude, why are they just awful?  Un-fucking-fun.  Un-fra... 
[03:08:00]  Not interesting.  Wow.  Why the fuck are they awful?  Why can't I watch women's basketball?  Why can't I listen to a woman rapper?  Women's singers I can get with.  Yeah.  A good woman singer?  Other than that, what the fuck?  You don't like Lil' Kim?  Come on, I like Lil' Kim.  Stop it.  I do.  She looks like Mickey Rourke now.  What woman's sport...  What woman's sport would you watch?  I watch women's volleyball for the...  For the S's.  For the jack-off reasons.  Yeah.  But what woman's sport...  Athletically?  Yeah, what would you watch that women do? 
[03:08:30]  Darts or pool or bowling?  I'm trying to think.  Would there be a sport I would watch for the athletic...  If it's not sex appeal?  Oh, yeah, you gotta take that out of it.  Boxing.  I'd love to see two chicks fucking duking it out.  I'm trying to think.  None.  The WNBA?  MMA shit?  Kickboxing?  I'd watch girls.  I'm gonna tell you why.  Because they're always trying to do it like men.  And it just looks like inferior...  It looks like children.  It's like Olympic stuff.  Yeah, it's just that...  Take a new Olympic stuff.  Anything they do that's...  Running is good to watch them run against other women. 
[03:09:00]  You know what's pissing me off about the NBA Finals?  And we've talked about it on this show.  The female sideline reporter.  There's a million NBA guys that would love that gig.  That aren't playing anymore.  That know the sport.  And instead they go to the sideline.  Whether it's in a football game or a basketball game.  What not?  Well, let me ask you.  What's the problem with the woman's sideline reporter?  That's my question.  There's something just wrong.  Because I want to listen to a guy that might have played...  You know what I mean? 
[03:09:30]  But see, the argument is they know what they're talking about and they know what questions to ask.  But it's like Sager, Craig Sager.  What's the difference between how he asks a question and how a lady asks a question?  I'm not a fan of his either.  That's what I'm saying.  I'd rather see an old NBA player out there.  But still, you still go, I'd rather watch Craig Sager.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like some old...  The lesser of two evils, but...  You just don't care.  But all of a sudden, it's a white chick and I'm like, what do you know about the NBA?  And you're just there and this dude is sweating?  Like announcers, the excuse is they went to some kind of school for that or whatever and learned their trade. 
[03:10:00]  I don't know.  The sideline reporter.  But why is it bad?  See, that's where you're not digging deep.  Why is it bad?  I don't know.  Exactly.  That's the question.  Why the fuck?  Maybe because they're invading a man's world or something.  Like when you're watching an NBA game.  I don't know.  I want a woman to invade my fucking world and not suck.  Because girls always complain about sports.  They never growing up participated in sports conversations. 
[03:10:30]  They were never fun about sports.  They never encouraged sports growing up ever.  And now all of a sudden, they see a gig and they want to be a part of it and it's annoying.  I'll answer the question.  I think the guys aren't being real because a woman is interviewing them.  Well, the question that asks, what are they going to say?  It goes back to the women in the locker room and all of a sudden, like, you know.  They were on TV, Opie, and they're asking him.  So they asked him a goofy question like, you had a great game.  How'd you have it? 
[03:11:00]  It's not like he can go.  Now, if he wasn't a girl, here's how I would answer.  Yo, motherfucker, nigga.  When I dunked it on that dude, you know what I'm saying?  He's going to say the same cornball shit he says to a woman.  I have a feeling they hold back a little bit for whatever reason.  Nah.  They're corny because it's on camera.  I think there's a girl asking a question.  A woman asking a question.  You don't feel like she gives a shit about the answer.  Like, you know she's only asking because that's her gig.  And she got that gig because she's a woman and complained that she wanted the gig.  Whereas a guy's asking.  And in your life, you have guys that go, how the fuck did you do that? 
[03:11:30]  And you go, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Right, right, right.  But in real life, a chick never comes up and goes, how did you fucking steal second that good?  Or how did you hit that free throw?  It just doesn't happen.  You almost feel like she doesn't even understand the questions she's asking.  That's why I love Charles Barkley.  You know Charles Barkley is one of the biggest womanizers.  I didn't know it until recently when he goes against this girl doing push-ups.  And she's, like, serious.  And she's doing good push-ups.  She does about 34.  And so Barkley does 35 just to beat her. 
[03:12:00]  And then he's laughing at her.  I'm hurting 35, though, right?  Nah.  He's a strong guy, man.  And at the end of the day, right, Kenny Smith goes, hey, Charles.  He said something.  He goes, Charles, how come you don't buy women watches?  He goes, because there's a clock on the stove.  I almost shit my pants.  That is a good one.  It's so fucking funny because that's what we did growing up. 
[03:12:30]  We teased girls.  We pointed at them and laughed at them.  A clock on the stove.  It's so awful.  But all of a sudden, we just, all of a sudden, it's like, I have to pretend I want to listen  to fucking Janice Salupi talk to me.  Like, it just ain't real.  How did Charles get his job back so fast?  That's how talented he is.  That's how valuable he is.  No.  It's the same way.  It's why David Letterman should tell Sarah Palin and go, shut the fuck up.  Charles said, look, I got caught drinking and driving. 
[03:13:00]  I was going to cheat on my woman.  I got bopped.  I was drunk and going to get some side pussy.  And I got bopped.  It is what it is.  I'm going to take a break.  And when he came back, the first thing he said was, look, don't, I'm going to say sorry  now.  I don't want to hear no more shit.  And that's it.  End of story.  I don't give a fuck.  I fucked up.  And I gamble.  It's my money.  Like, shut the fuck up.  Charles is basically like, fuck you.  And that's how you said him.  I always said this shit about Michael Richards and Pee Wee Herman are the poster childs for 
[03:13:30]  being phony.  Look, would I ever take a job on the Disney Channel?  No.  I just know that it's possible I can jerk off or call somebody a nigga.  It just, you know, it's like, so you do things that are up your alley.  You know what I'm saying?  You have a job where you can tease, you can joke about you fucking young bitches.  Can't do that if you're on That's So Raven or the Jonas Brothers.  Right.  The Jonas Brothers can't fuck up ever.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  Ever.  They do something.  Breaking it.  MC Hammer's here. 
[03:14:00]  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to talk to MC Hammer.  And then we're going to get the fuck out of here.  Patrice O'Neill's at Comics tonight and tomorrow.  Let me get through this.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com or 212-524-2500 for tickets downtown.  It's a great club.  We've been there a bunch.  And on Twitter, it's Big Mama Prods.  Yeah, man.  To follow Patrice O'Neill.  Say it with love, nigga.  Big Mama Prods.  I'm going to be following Opie Radio now.  Yeah, we'll do a little back and forth.  Good numbers, too, by the way, sweetie. 
[03:14:30]  What, 40 Gs?  Well, I'm a whore, though.  I mean, I'm just whoring.  How many numbers you got there, Ant?  Quick break.  We got a break.  I got half that many.  Yeah, but he's doing Gs.  I don't Twitter that much.  But he's doing something else.  I'm doing a TV thing.  I think Hammer has 950,000.  Keep it quiet.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I just keep it all quiet.  Ant does a nice podcast from his house.  We're allowed to mention that.  Do you?  We just shouldn't be talking too much about it.  So we're doing different things on the side.  It's nice.  What's going on now?  MC Hammer next.  Can't touch this. 
[03:15:00]  Can't touch this.  I'm sure MC Hammer wants to hear this as he comes into the studio.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neill, comics this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  And Big Mama Prods on Twitter as MC Hammer makes his way into the studio.  Yeah, he hasn't heard this enough.  He probably has.  Oh, literal Jim.  I got to apologize right off the bat.  They're playing like can't touch this.  I'm sure you heard it way too much, right? 
[03:15:30]  I mean, but it's my record though.  You know, come on.  Everybody in this business got an eagle, baby.  You stroke the eagle.  Stroke the eagle.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  No, you know.  It's all right.  I'm so goddamn sick of you.  People in goddamn chromium pants dancing around at every friggin' news thing that you're doing.  I'm laughing my balls off.  No, no, no.  I'm not laughing the same as you laughing.  I like to see them dancing in their pants.  Are you kidding me?  I like to see them dancing in their pants.  You got to be kidding me.  Why?  Because do you think it's funny just to watch them being terrible at it? 
[03:16:00]  No, it's more, it's just, you know, it's flattering.  No one could really.  Flatterant.  No one could do it as well.  It's a problem.  They do their thing, man.  Yeah, they certainly do.  Dancing is subjective.  Well, we're not going to do it here, I'm saying.  Yeah, I think we're going to still.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's part of the deal.  We're not going to do it.  That's part of the deal.  I'm coming in and doing nothing unless you're going to get out in the pants.  I bought four or five pair with me, so, you know.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Everybody's got to wear their pants. 
[03:16:30]  Jesus.  So we're promoting what?  Hammer Time?  It's going to be on A&E, 10 p.m. on Sunday.  We're promoting what?  Yeah.  No, I'll tell you.  I'll be completely honest with you.  I didn't know what the hell you were up to until two days ago.  I told you outside the studio they had a flash mob video.  Right, right, right.  It went online.  It's viral.  It's unbelievable.  And then all of a sudden, I know all about Hammer Time now.  Thank God for that viral video.  We don't want to have you out of the loop here.  We're trying to do things.  But it was beautiful marketing, really quick for the people that haven't seen it. 
[03:17:00]  It's some kind of clothing store in L.A.  You know the mob thing where all of a sudden everyone shows up at the same time.  Yeah.  And there's people in the store.  And next thing you know, the door opens.  And how many people?  200?  Easy?  Yeah, it looks like about 200 people.  Maybe 200 people.  And they're doing the dance and everything and freaking out at everybody.  And then there's a line dance that goes on.  And then all of a sudden, someone blows a whistle.  And these people are gone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the people are left going, what the fuck is this?  And that's what I said at home.  And then I'm like, oh, okay.  He's doing a reality show. 
[03:17:30]  Right?  Man, thank God for that.  Because I can't have you out of the loop.  You know, you're important in this big picture here.  Yeah, so the video, yeah, it's pretty cool.  It's been four days.  It has a million views already.  So it went viral really quickly.  And, you know, people relate to the video.  It was a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  How were you approached to do the show?  Like, because, you know, you're kind of out of the picture for a little while there.  Well, you know, seven, maybe eight years ago, I did the original Surreal Life.  That's seven years ago already? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, seven years ago.  And while we were doing that show, I got offered an actual sitcom out of that because they see I got it pretty quickly.  And it was over at Warner Brothers.  And at that time, the president changed.  And so we didn't do anything.  But the guys who did that show with me end up becoming the biggest producers of reality TV in the business.  So they ended up doing all the whole block for VH1, the Flavor of Love, New York, all the same guys. 
[03:18:30]  Abrego?  Chris Abrego and Mark Cronin.  And I'm leaving out somebody.  Who was with you on that?  Was that the Webster year?  Yeah, that was Webster year.  I love that.  I love the original Surreal.  That was the original one, yeah.  It was the Webster year?  And was Tammy Pinkbaker was on that one?  No, no.  Vince Neil.  Corey Feldman.  All right.  Manuel Lewis.  Yeah, but that was the year.  So that was the first show.  And that was when you went off about the sushi on the girl. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  They had sushi on the naked girl and Hammer wasn't having it.  Right, right, right, right.  We were like, hold on, man.  I ain't getting down with all that, man.  Y'all exploiting her.  Anyway, you know.  You're not going to exploit women, Hammer?  Not like that, man.  I'm out of here, man.  Only personal.  Hey, lookit, lookit.  Personal.  Personal.  No, I ain't in that.  No, I don't believe in that.  You know that.  We'll be exploiting the women.  But anyway.  One of those videos we were just watching.  Except for 3-5-7 back in the day.  I'm playing around with you.  I'm messing with you.  What are they doing? 
[03:19:30]  What are they doing?  Wait, wait, wait.  And the two big MC, what are they doing?  Okay, hold on.  Chain of thought, man.  Hold on.  Don't digress, man.  Keep the chain of things focused, man.  Y'all focus in here.  Lookit, I wanted to say that to Patrice for years.  Thank you, MC.  Hey, no, so I'm only saying that to say.  Tell him to breathe, too.  I just wanted to breathe.  Because that will help the show as well.  I just wanted to see if he had another two big MC.  I thought I'd try to be that.  I love two big MC.  We hold auditions for that right after this.  And you better be ready since you put it out there.  But no, so anyway, I made a decision that I wouldn't do reality unless I had creative control. 
[03:20:00]  Unless I could be executive producer, creator of the show, I wouldn't do it.  So I got to offer shows for the last six, seven years all the time.  I said, no, no, no.  And about a year and some change ago, Andy approached me and gave me a call and said,  would you be interested in doing a show with us?  We've been doing some research, your demographics, blah, blah, blah.  And I said, under these circumstances, these parameters, I would be interested.  And we cut the deal.  And it still took another year to get the language right because I wanted to make sure that the language is right. 
[03:20:30]  And so that's how, that's the genesis of how this show came about.  What is it about you that makes you, I mean, people are fascinated by you.  Like, I mean, there's been a lot of rappers who have been successful, who have put out a lot of albums.  But people have had a longstanding fascination with you.  Is it because you were perceived to have been doing really well and then not doing well?  What is it that people are just, they can't get enough of you?  He was famous.  No, no, no.  But it's more than that with him.  It's more than that with him.  He was famous.  No rapper was famous. 
[03:21:00]  No, people are not as, people don't as say LL Cool J.  I'm going to let him go back and forth.  Work it out, guys.  Work it out.  Work it out.  Let me answer this for you.  Work it out.  Go ahead.  Work it out.  Work it out.  Work it out.  Work it out.  I mean, you know.  Of course you were.  That's why I said there's been a lot of rappers.  I didn't say you're the only guy that ever do that.  But there's been a lot of rappers.  So I'm saying, what is he?  Nobody's asking Karras 1 to do a reality show.  Because Karras 1 wasn't famous.  He was famous, but not as famous.  Famous.  There's no such thing as, he was, Hammer had a show. 
[03:21:30]  He had 100 guys on.  He wasn't a rapper.  He's right here.  In terms of.  Yeah, exactly.  He's not dead.  I'm letting him work it out, man.  Work it out.  Hammer, you wasn't a rapper.  Like, he was famous.  That's what it was.  He was famous.  Yes, he was famous.  Hammer was the first famous rapper.  What?  No, he wasn't.  There was no way else.  He was very famous, but not the first.  Run DMC?  They weren't famous?  They weren't famous till after, I would argue, till after.  They were very famous.  He went this way, but he was.  Oh, wow.  LL Cool J was famous?  No. 
[03:22:00]  Mainstream fame, you're talking.  I'm talking.  Fab Five Freddy, motherfucker.  I'm just saying, it was a phenomenon, dude.  I see, I was just going to watch us argue now.  Say, hey, at any point, you know, you guys, if you know.  What's your opinion on the matter?  Oh.  We're listening to another rapper to be a phenomenon like you, Hammer.  You were phenomenal.  If you can stand on the outside and look at not you.  You know, it ain't my, I should say, it's not my style to compliment, you know, I don't  want to fan my own famous.  But what I'm saying is, by the way, for the first time, I even addressed my perspective 
[03:22:30]  on all of it, from a business perspective, from, I did it with allhiphop.com and video-wise,  and they're going to release it this weekend.  But I actually put everything in proper perspective for the first time, and I articulate some of  the things that you are saying from my perspective.  So, you know, that third person, the Hammer thing, at one point, second album, keep in  mind, my first album sold three million copies.  So, when I was, when I became a quote-unquote popular artist, there was a foundation that 
[03:23:00]  was laid already of, you know, triple platinum album, and I had already gone from an opener  to a closer on my first album.  So, it was not like I came out of nowhere.  With the second album, when I hit number one, I hit number one in January, and in the summer,  in July, I was still number one.  You have to really put that in perspective.  Just understand what you know about radio, records come out every Tuesday, and there's 
[03:23:30]  a staff of people who are responsible for getting records to number one, and that's their job.  They had to come and tell a boss every week, from January to July, who's number one this  week?  MC Hammer?  February?  What was the big song from that album?  I'm going to make a point.  So, we go all the way through that.  So, I picked up a lot of competitors and enemies along the way. 
[03:24:00]  Marketing budgets.  At one point, it became the other five labels, marketing budgets, versus Hammer and his labels.  You did destroy Hammer campaign.  Exactly.  That's the point I'm making.  So, when you say, what's the fascination, you got to understand that I took on the entire  music business as one artist for a half a year.  In other words, literally millions of marketing dollars versus just our marketing budget, and  it was, how can we fight the Hammer movement? 
[03:24:30]  Was that too legit to quit time?  No, that came secondly, but that was the tail end of the attack, because the first one failed.  So, the first one is like, how do we take on Hammer?  Oh, okay.  At the end of that one, he sold 10 million records just on that album.  So, they lost that one.  So, with the Too Legit to Quit album, they started early.  So, it was like...  Oh, that was the third album.  That was the third album.  Oh, that was before the destruction.  Too Legit to Quit.  That's right.  That's right.  After the destruction.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I know where you're going.  What was the hit off the second album?  That's where we're all lost. 
[03:25:00]  That was Can't Touch This.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, it was.  Second album is Can't Touch This.  First album is on Three Legit.  Turn this mother out.  Let's get it started.  Ring them.  They put me in a mix.  All the records came on my first...  I had six known records off my first album and five videos.  So, when you ask, what is it?  It's a lot.  It's a lot.  If you just put on a Hammer mix right now, you're going to go through 20 songs that people  actually know.  One just is so far above the others, but there's 20 songs that I do in concert. 
[03:25:30]  Listen, my song, Adam's Groove, from the Adam's Family movie.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Oh, I forgot about that one.  Just that song.  I forgot about that monster.  That one itself sold, and I quote, four million singles.  Just that one.  Just that song.  Wow.  And that's off the Too Legit to quit.  Did you see his first video?  The one that was shot?  The one that put him on the...  Yeah, yeah.  It was shot like a...  I think Turn This Mother... 
[03:26:00]  No!  What, Too Legit?  The one that was shot, looked like it was shot like an unfinished construction site  kind of thing.  It was real raw.  The one where you, Oaktown 357...  Oh, that's off the first album.  It wasn't...  I forgot, but it was...  It put him on the map.  It was like...  So just to put that in perspective, keep in mind, this all began in 88.  So that's the other thing that you have to understand.  From 88 till 95, my last hit of that run was Seven Years Later, which was my worst album. 
[03:26:30]  It only sold like 1.8 million.  So it was a real bad time for me.  With that bumps and the rumps.  Exactly.  They said with that one, he's definitely finished because he's only sold about a million, seven  million, eight.  You should have sold thongs after that.  Holy shit.  We couldn't stop him at the thong.  So that one, I'm saying, the two platinum singles off of that one was It's All Good  and Pumps in the Bump.  So anyway, so that's what it is.  It's a combination of years and years of hits, years and years of touring, million and millions 
[03:27:00]  of records, and they're affiliated with movies and a whole lot of stuff.  I want you to back up for a second.  When you're on the level you are and you sell 1.8 million, they look at that as like  a failure almost, right?  Like it was a bust.  Yeah, but they can't do that.  Which is insane.  I'm saying, but you know, I'm from the inside out, not outside in, but you're right.  You're right.  They say, hey, for you, what do you mean for me?  Your record right next to mine, same store.  What do you mean?  Here they come.  For you, MC Hammer, it's another hit, obviously. 
[03:27:30]  1.8 million of anything is unbelievable, but when you're on the level you were at, they're  like, oh, it was a flop.  See, he's done.  Yeah, well, you can't fool me with that.  You're done after selling 1.8 million.  That's ridiculous.  Right, right.  Well, and I knew that at that time because I'm, you know, I know that.  I mean, your record is, this is the argument I always have with anybody.  Wait a minute.  Did you make a record at the same time I made one?  Okay.  Did you put yours in the same stores?  You did?  Oh, same out?  So they came in and here's the acid test.  When they went in their wallet, they brought their money out and said, I'll take one of 
[03:28:00]  those and yours that you classified as all different type of nomenclatures you put on  it to justify it, not selling.  It's like, oh, no, this is over here.  This is what you call classic right here.  This right here is real, unique.  We're giving it to them raw.  Whatever it is, it means it don't sell.  That's what it means.  When that money come out of that wallet, they say, I'll take this home and this resonates  with my family with me and we enjoy it.  So those kind of battles that I fought early on also contribute to my longevity in the 
[03:28:30]  long run.  The other thing I want to mention, when you first started, too, you were selling your  own records out of the hood of your car, right?  Yeah.  Out of the trunk.  Sorry, sorry.  Why does Spock plug her and see that?  Yeah.  This whole room hasn't slept.  We all stayed up all night.  We had things last night.  But yeah, out of the trunk of your car, you were selling your own album.  Yeah, I started off selling the records out of the trunk.  I went to all the music events.  So even two years before that, I came here to New York in 1986, went to the Latin quarters 
[03:29:00]  where all the rappers were doing their thing.  And I announced myself as, I'm next, man.  I'm next.  And of course, it was like, yeah, right.  So that led to the Turn This Mother Out song when I said, man, I'm getting some momentum  here.  I'm hitting in Cleveland.  I'm hitting in Detroit.  But Hammer, you ain't hitting in New York.  I wrote that myself because I'm saying I'm not satisfied until I take on New York.  And I imagine that from the West Coast, from Oakland, challenging New York. 
[03:29:30]  To be here in New York, because I remember I was 18 when Hammer came out.  So I was essentially an adult.  And the thing is, it was the visual that got people.  People love Hammer.  He did the running man first.  He did a lot of stuff first.  And I'm telling you, the visual with the hook, he was a phenomenon back then.  I'm telling you.  Oh, yeah.  You ain't got to tell me.  I remember.  I mean, it's amazing. 
[03:30:00]  But let me ask you, if you come out with something else, are you retired from music?  Are you kidding me?  The melodies never stop.  So I'm only saying...  Are you going to have to dance?  Are you going to dance, though?  You've got to be, what are you, 76?  Hammer's pliers now.  I'm about to swing on him.  I'm about to swing on him.  I'm going to swing on him.  I mean, hold on.  I was just saying, Hammer.  I'm cold with these.  I'm cold.  You didn't comment on how good the skin looking, man.  Hammer's a big veto, man.  Hammer's in great shape, man. 
[03:30:30]  No, no, thank you.  Hammer's in good shape.  Yeah.  I mean, he's starting in 86.  He doesn't look old enough to start in 86.  All right?  How old are you, Hammer, do you say?  No, I do.  Of course, I'm proud I'm 47.  Yeah, I'm very proud because, you know,  it ain't no 22, 24 years old, 25-year-olds  who do what we do in the music business.  They're not in this kind of shade.  They get drunk, stay high too much.  They can't hit the hip.  They can't do it.  You know, I lift 80s for breakfast.  I curl 80s for breakfast.  You know, ugh, ugh, ugh.  So, you know, so anyway, I enjoy working out. 
[03:31:00]  I enjoy dancing.  I just, you know, I did a show in Detroit a couple weeks ago.  I got Thomas and Mac Center in Las Vegas.  It's June 25th week, and I perform all the time.  And I must say, it's not pathetic.  Like, you see, you know, you might see an old Tim Chase's reunion.  Hey, leave the Tim Chase alone.  It's not, like, Hammer, you did something where you had a fur coat on something.  You just did a little cameo.  I think it might have been a B.T. award.  25th anniversary, I think.  And people get mesmerized.  He had a little fur coat, and he only did a little hammering. 
[03:31:30]  Hammering.  Yeah, just a little bit.  And it wasn't pathetic.  It was like, you go, holy, Hammer still got it.  Appreciate that.  You know, I love dancing.  I do, I do, I do.  And people root for you, too.  Like, people just root for you.  Dude, people, it's just because, you know, in the hood, you just go, you know the story.  And, you know, the hood talks.  Like, I don't know how white people end up in the position they are in terms of fame.  Like, when you talk in, in, in, it's all the grand conspiracy. 
[03:32:00]  I don't know what he does.  Like, put it this way.  God puts us there.  Like, like, like, like, the rise, like, the rise and the fall and the rise of Led Zeppelin or something.  I'm just putting the word out.  Aerosmith's a good one.  Everyone knows the hammer, the hammer, the thing, the thing, the thing, the thing with hammer.  So it's just interesting, man.  And it's like, you just go, man, every, you just know what people are saying at a particular time in a particular way.  And you just go, that, that BET thing, you just go hammer, pulled his head, his fur coat. 
[03:32:30]  And they just went, boom.  And he just did two things.  And people are like, God, holy shit.  Now you got the TV show.  What, what, what level of, like, your life are we going to see here?  Is this pretty uncensored as far as what, what you do?  What are we going to be seeing?  Well, we introduced a man.  And so what I mean by that is, and by the way, everything that I've said, you know, so far in this interview, none of it was to be self-serving.  I was just trying to describe the scenario, you know, of my career and why you were debating and I was listening on, you know, he was famous. 
[03:33:00]  You know, I was just trying to quantify.  But no, I wasn't saying that you weren't famous.  No, no, no, no, no.  I was just trying to quantify, you know, how it was.  I think it came across.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, believe it or not, I hate toot my own horn.  It's not about that.  I just like to, I like to perform, you know.  But so, so, you know, on the show, what, one of the reasons why I said yes is because nobody really knows me outside of the music. 
[03:33:30]  And my friends and my business partners have complained for 12 years as if it's my fault.  They'll go in there and they'll say, Hammer, why do you, when you, when you go on radio, why do you talk like that?  Why do you, why won't you let them see the business acumen or the man?  I said, well, it's not the right place.  There's not enough time.  You know, it's, I'm on the next guy's zone.  So with the show, I get to show the father, the uncle that I am, the brother, the businessman. 
[03:34:00]  I do a panel at the MIT Stanford lab.  You know, you know, in the last two months right now, I've lectured at Stanford on social media, Harvard on social media.  I'm an early adopter of social media platforms.  I've been going to Google for the last six, seven years.  What's social media, by the way?  I don't know.  I'll explain what I'm saying.  So I've been doing these things for quite a while.  I don't know what it is. 
[03:34:30]  He's saying where, I don't like how Hammer's just.  I just like how he shuts you up.  I like how Hammer's just hammer.  We can learn from our social, you know.  But he has a way of just shutting you up.  No, I just got to finish my thought.  I'm going to finish my thought.  You know, I ain't shutting them off.  I'm just finishing my thought.  So what I'm saying is I got a love for technology early on.  It was, I wanted to figure out how to get my videos on the Internet.  So I had to learn this stuff.  You got me laughing.  All right, so social media.  Hey, where'd you get your hat? 
[03:35:00]  See how it is?  Here we go.  There we go.  Now we're in the same question.  All we're saying is Mr. Hammer was trying to make a point.  And he didn't let him make a point.  Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.  Well, he's on Twitter.  He's a big Twitter guy.  No, see, I like how you tried to avoid.  You know, I'm real fast.  I got that.  I got that.  But I won't pull the cover off.  He's a big Twitter guy.  Is that bad?  So what do I ask?  I won't do it to you. 
[03:35:30]  I won't do it to you.  I won't do it.  I won't do it.  You know, you know, right?  What are you going to do to him?  He knows.  He's going to beat me up.  So I'm a big Twitter guy.  Yes.  I was an early adopter of Twitter.  I actually, the founders invited me to come speak on my business idea of monetization of the platform a month ago, which I had actually approached him a year ago to say, here's some things that we'll be able to do in the music business with this platform, ultimately, which include, I have a show at Radio City Music Hall. 
[03:36:00]  You should be able to just click here, and that ticket goes right to the phone, to the emails, done.  So the challenge, and what's scary for a lot of business people, unbeknownst to many, is that the distance between creation of content and the consumer has shortened drastically.  So you put the music on.  You like the song.  I start talking about my concert.  As of the day, I'll use myself for example.  I'm probably at 800,000 followers. 
[03:36:30]  So let's just say that 20,000 of them or 50,000 of them are here in New York.  I'm only trying to sell 4,000 seats at the Radio City Music Hall.  I announce my concert.  I sell the tickets all from my phone.  We're done.  Oh, I didn't buy no commercials.  I'm sorry, gentlemen.  Maybe I'll circle back to that in a few years.  It's like iTunes cutting the record industry out.  You're cutting all these middlemen out.  It's all, and it's done.  It's not like maybe it'll happen.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  So the things that we need to do to just finish the transactional things, those, they already exist. 
[03:37:00]  And we just move them over, and we integrate them into the interface.  So that's the kind of stuff that I like to stay on top of, because the music industry is very slow to adopt.  New technology, and it kills them.  And I'm a music guy.  So if you want, as a business, get in early, I'll do it as an individual.  It has, yeah.  So I don't know what that got to do with hammer time, but.  I don't even know how to ask this, but you seem like you're a great businessman.  You have a great head on your shoulders. 
[03:37:30]  So what happened?  What happened?  The famous behind the music where we all saw, like, holy shit.  Hammer was on top of the world, lost it all, and now obviously has brought it right back up.  Well, but what happened in that time where, like, you were losing your way?  Loyalty.  I would say two things that you said earlier.  One, you said how big the show is.  Right.  Well, the show is a business.  And behind the show is another layer of business, the support team.  And behind the music biz, the music, the label, is another support team. 
[03:38:00]  So it's real simple.  You never heard me on the radio or television or any other existing mediums complain about how the rise and fall of MC Hammer.  MC Hammer, he pissed it all off.  Whatever, however you want.  It did become kind of a, you were like the Xerox.  Right.  Absolutely.  And you never.  That guy pulled a hammer.  Right.  Exactly.  And what I did.  I fucked up.  But it's true. 
[03:38:30]  It's true.  No, but it's true.  You're right.  It's true.  What, he was dancing?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  So I was very aware of.  Right, right.  And I just listened.  And I said, wow.  Because there were two chain of thoughts for me.  One is that it's not like you don't really know.  It wasn't no secret.  Like, everybody knew that I had 200 employees.  It wasn't no secret.  So what do you think?  I was paying them in hamburgers.  So, you know, you know, somebody was paying that payroll and it wasn't falling in front. 
[03:39:00]  So I was doing that.  So if you wanted to now say the story is MC Hammer just pissed his money off when you knew that I was employing 200 people from my community.  It said more about you than it did about me.  So I didn't go on the radio to defend that.  Because every now and then somebody would say, after the sensational part of it, they said, you know, he took care of a lot of people.  But anyway, we're going right next to the next commercial.  So I said, wow, this is very interesting to me.  So if a guy that, you know, in the middle of the crack era, when everybody was dying, machine guns everywhere, decided he wanted to try to pull some guys out of that. 
[03:39:30]  If his fate is to be the guy who we're going to introduce for the next 14 years is, hey, we're going to talk about MC Hammer next, how he pissed off 30 million.  Man, that's what you get for trying to contribute to the community.  But the guy who might be known for exploiting, and of course, we got our man right now with the hottest record in the world coming on next. 
[03:40:00]  He says, every in the country need to drop down now and suck here.  Coming up next, our hero.  I said, oh, so I need to let them do that.  And I'm going somewhere else for a while because that fight I'm not fighting.  That's a personal fight.  That's your perspective on life, the world, and how you see things.  I can't fight that.  You got to have what you want.  Some people love this.  Some people love that.  Never heard your perspective on that whole thing.  I never did.  I never did.  Don't hire nobody. 
[03:40:30]  This is the first time on our dopey show.  Yeah, I mean, I'm saying I never did it because I didn't need to.  Did people take advantage of you?  People take advantage of your loyalty, your good nature?  They didn't take advantage of me because even as you hear me speak, and not to pat myself on the back, but you can see I'm a pretty smart guy.  So it's not like you was doing a shell game in front of me and I'm picking the wrong pea or something.  Three-carg molly.  No, I just mean with 200 people, it's a little easier to hide stuff with that many people.  It's a different.  There's a loyalty, but I also think. 
[03:41:00]  It's not loyalty in this case per se.  But you're also on a really high level, so when that level started to drop a little bit, it made it tougher to take care of all these people, right?  We're just talking about revenue generation.  It's not real complicated.  Are you making enough money to sustain the business?  It's not that.  But from my perspective, it was loyalty, but I just wanted to do loyalty with the interpretation of it.  We were dying.  This is the real thing.  It's not fake.  Go and look at the murder rate in my city at the time.  My city became very famous for being in the top three in homicides. 
[03:41:30]  That's where I live.  That's where I grew up my entire life.  I didn't grow up somewhere else.  Some of the people that were dying were my classmates, my neighbors.  So when I had the hammer thing, I would literally call home.  I'd be on the road.  I'd call home and somebody would say, I'd say, hey, what's John doing?  What do you mean what's John doing?  John dead.  I'd say, what do you mean John is dead?  I just talked to him two weeks ago.  He'd say, yeah, John dead and Sam killed him.  Sam lived two houses down from John killed him.  Over what?  Well, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:42:00]  So I'd say, well, let me speak to Sam there.  Hey, Sam, man, check this out, man.  Why?  I'd say, why don't you come out here on the road with me, man?  I can give you $30,000 a year.  I can't give you what you're making on the block.  But, man, I can't have you keep doing what you're doing.  I mean, you're killing the very cats we grew up with.  Well, 10 turned to 20, 20 turned to 30.  I'm cool with that.  I was cool with that because the amount of money that I was generating was worth the lives to me.  Now, in retrospect, for the sake of story, I always say, Hammer, if you had to do it all over again, wouldn't you? 
[03:42:30]  Come on, Hammer, just say you kept some of that money.  I say, yeah, you know, if I had to do it all over again, I would absolutely, you know, put some of that money in the bank and all that.  But the real truth is, not in exchange for the lives that lived, I wouldn't do it.  I always knew that I could generate money.  I had my first job at 8, at 9.  It's very documented.  You can go to my Twitter right now and pull up a picture of me and Hank Aaron.  It says, the two hammers finally meet.  Know what the date of the picture says?  1975. 
[03:43:00]  I've seen that.  In 1975, I was already in my third year of a job.  I've been an entrepreneur from day one, so I'm not ever concerned about generating money, but I got caught up in my humanity.  So, just to summarize, you decided to go down with the ship.  You didn't have to go down with the ship.  I didn't have to.  They pulled me in.  You should have told 30 guys with shiny pants, get out.  That is probably very true.  You see that move we did last show?  Do that right at that end. 
[03:43:30]  Keep going.  Keep going with that.  When we get the running man to the left, just don't come back.  Do that tini-toe move to the left and keep doing it.  Don't open the door.  Someone will open the door for you.  Dance left until you hit the water.  And keep going, right?  There's something else that has to be said.  I think you also were taking a gamble, too.  Like, all right, I see that this thing is sinking, but I'm just one song away from bringing this whole damn thing right back up.  As if you were in my brain. 
[03:44:00]  Right?  I absolutely felt that way.  I felt like...  Because you're way too smart to just watch it sink.  No, I actually did think that.  The whole time you were probably thinking, all right, it's going to take one song, one of this, one of that.  We go right back out on the road.  I generate more money, and everything is cool.  Well, it didn't happen like that.  And so that was the difference between, you know, being able to sustain it long enough between hits.  Because I made a decision that was the craziest thing from a business perspective, probably in the history of touring.  When we come off the road, what are you guys going to do? 
[03:44:30]  Well, you know, I heard the mumbling.  What do you mean?  What do you think we're going to do?  We're going to go get some of these keys and get to work.  Keep it moving.  I was like...  Were you worried?  Were these guys around you?  Yeah, they was around me.  Remember what I'm saying?  The dudes that were the gangsters that you had around you.  Did that make you a little nervous?  Well, no, because I'm kind of, you know, I know how to switch my hats, man.  So, you know...  Hammered means something else than we always thought it would.  I know.  I ain't never...  I ain't never had a problem with that, ever, ever, ever, ever. 
[03:45:00]  So, we all grew up in the same way you ended up with that mentality.  I ended up, but I decided not to access it.  Immediately when I'm angry, it's not my first option.  Right.  So, but I made the decision.  You know, I was like, man, you know, when we off the road...  No, don't do that, because one, we back in the same hole again.  I ain't got time for these funerals.  I'm tired of it.  I'm not doing it.  So, I'm going to keep y'all on the payroll, even when we not on the road.  Amazing.  So, I paid the same amount of money when I was off the road as I did when I was on. 
[03:45:30]  It was a very conscious decision.  And it was, in hindsight, from many perspectives, you're going to say, man, you shouldn't have did that.  And, again, I wrestled with it.  I'm going to wrestle with it for the rest of my life.  My conclusion is, nah, I'll take life.  And thank God it all turned out okay from an economic standpoint.  But, historically, the story will probably never be told away.  It'll never be told that way.  This will probably be the last time it's told that way.  But everybody who was there and who know about it, know every word that I'm saying the truth. 
[03:46:00]  You come to my studio, you'll see 60 new cars out there.  They all belong to my employees and my dancers.  I co-signed for everybody.  Because they go down to the bank and they couldn't qualify for a car.  And I thought that was very insulting.  So, I would say, you know what?  What do you mean they can't?  They worked for me.  They got a job.  Well, this is their first bit of credit.  Oh, so you want to insult people.  Okay, no problem.  Send it over to me.  I'm co-signing.  Well, I end up co-signing for 60 cars.  So, I was like, but I want to create a middle class right now among the people who work for me to show that we don't only have to hustle hard. 
[03:46:30]  We don't only have to sell dope.  We don't only have to bring these machine guns to you to make this money.  So, that was my dilemma.  And that's why I ended up going down with the ship.  Because I hope that one more hit, we can keep it going.  But we didn't get to one more hit.  So, I got the hit.  It was called bankruptcy.  And that's why you never heard me complain. 
[03:47:00]  I took the hit and took the hits.  You took them from zero to 60.  That's what the issue is.  It's like, you can't just take somebody from a certain, because I got friends where I'm like, hey, man, instead of going to Atlanta for whatever you're going to do, let's save up your money.  Let's go to Melbourne, Australia.  And it's like, what?  So, if I just took them to Melbourne, Australia, that would be not smart.  I would have to teach them somehow to want to go to Melbourne.  But, he just, he gave them stuff.  And what they did is just, Hammers giving us stuff. 
[03:47:30]  I crippled some people.  I did.  I did.  Some people, some people I crippled.  Because some guys never wanted to work again.  No, seriously.  Some of my guys were like, seven years later, five years later, after bankruptcy, hey, what you doing?  Shoot, waiting for you to get it on, man.  I said, man, come on, you can't beat me.  Man, shoot, we waiting for that next hit.  Hey, man, that was, you know, that was five years ago, dog.  And you had to, it's all right, man.  I'm all right.  I'm going to hold on to it. 
[03:48:00]  And eight years later, waiting for that next hammer hit.  So, I crippled some cats.  How much pressure did that put on you when you were writing?  Because now, all of a sudden, you're writing to sustain a financial empire instead of just as an artist.  That's well said.  That's well said.  So, yeah, at some point.  We're really smart, Hammers.  Yeah, you guys, you know, you should do.  You guys should actually try to, like, get on the radio or something.  These bikes are actually going to be on.  We got to press smart.  And I didn't mean to cut you off, but it was such a, you know, dead on point statement.  It all changed. 
[03:48:30]  Because, as you know, I write from a very joyous, dancing, reflective position.  That's the other thing, without digressing too far.  For every dance record I made, I made a record dealing with issues.  The issue records are never as big as the dance records.  But I say we got to pray, help the children.  When we're living in a world like this, why can't we live together?  So I always balanced them all.  But by the time I got to the funky headhunter, one is I was tired of cats who wouldn't want to see the other hammer on no day in their life, under any circumstances. 
[03:49:00]  Physical, choose your choice of weapons.  Whatever it is that you engage another man with, you wouldn't want a piece of me under no circumstances.  Making records where they get to say my name or, you know, stuff like that.  I, you know, I ain't never been that cat.  And so, you know, I made a record that I wouldn't have normally made and addressed some of those issues.  And I wrote from the perspective of what you said.  One, we need a big hit. 
[03:49:30]  And two, I want some heads.  Listen, they're going to turn us off in two minutes.  We're on a computer and we want to make sure everyone knows about Hammer Time, which is the reality show you're pushing big time.  And this Sunday, 10 p.m. on A&E.  And he's learned his lesson because he came here with his son.  That's it.  I didn't see a hundred guys in the hall.  No, no, no, no.  No funny haircut, just him and his son.  They're going to get here, but they came by mule.  They're still walking in from Oakland.  They're going to get here next year. 
[03:50:00]  God willing, they're on season two of Hammer Time.  And look, my final plug then.  Hammer Time will be Sunday night, 10 p.m.  on A&E.  You know what?  You sold me.  I'm going to watch.  Start and win.  Start and win.  For real, I'm going to watch this.  This Sunday's the first show?  Yeah, this is the first show this Sunday.  We'll definitely watch.  And Patrice, they're going to shut us off.  Yeah, I know.  Patrice did comics tonight and tomorrow.  It's going to be an awkward ending because the computer's going to knock us off.  It happened to me before.  They turned my lights off before.  That's a different story. 
[03:50:30]  I've seen that before.  Go ahead.  Okay, everybody get ready.  It's going out now.  Yeah, pretty much.  40 seconds.  So, comics tonight and tomorrow for Patrice.  And they're telling me that your Twitter name's wrong.  It's Big Mama.  B-I-G-M-O-M-M-A-P-R-O-D-S.  Okay.  One word.  And mine is one word.  M.C. Hammer.  Oh, shit.  Twitter.  How do you get M.C. Hammer?  You invest early.  Oh, that's right.  He was twitting early.  That's right.  That's right.  Before anyone else could get it. 
[03:51:00]  All right, we're out of here for the weekend.  And I don't know.  We'll see you.  We'll see you on Monday.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
