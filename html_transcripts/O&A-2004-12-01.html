<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with AC/DC's "Highway to Hell" and a self-deprecating intro referencing a hefty FCC fine stemming from a 2002 St. Patrick's Cathedral sex stunt.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, immediately launched into vulgar and sexually explicit banter, heavily punctuated with curse words, and promoted "Whip Em Out Wednesday," encouraging women to flash their breasts at drivers displaying "wow" signs.  A lengthy segment featured a darkly comedic analysis of a creepy 1970s public service announcement about the dangers of LSD, focusing on a scene where a woman on a bad trip mistakes her friend's penis for a hot dog.  The hosts added their own exaggerated, vulgar embellishments to the story.

Listener calls followed, including a request for "The Police Got My Car" (which resulted in audio playback issues), and a suggestion to promote the show with signs at a televised football game.  A discussion on World AIDS Day ensued, incorporating a satirical *Team America: World Police* song about AIDS.  Several XM Radio commercials aired throughout the show.

A significant portion of the broadcast detailed the hosts' frustrations with their XM Satellite Radio workplace meetings, characterizing them as unproductive and filled with corporate jargon and a lack of initiative.  They contrasted this with their own ambition.  The Scott Peterson trial and Lacey Peterson's mother's emotional outburst in court were also discussed, leading to a conversation about the perceived unfairness of the divorce system and its impact on men.  The segment concluded with further complaints about inadequate support and resources from XM.

A substantial discussion about divorce, heavily biased toward the negative experiences of men, dominated a later segment.  One host recounted his own contentious divorce, emphasizing the perceived legal unfairness and financial burden on men, including a shocking attempt by his ex-wife's lawyers to make him pay her heirs after her death.  He shared humorous (yet expletive-laden) anecdotes from his divorce proceedings, including forgetting his wedding anniversary on the witness stand while facing reporters from the New York Post and Daily News, and described his ex-wife as a "crazy cat lady" who burned his belongings and gave his clothes to the homeless. Callers shared similar stories reinforcing the theme of men being disadvantaged in divorce.  This segment also featured the darkly humorous song "Full Blown AIDS" (both studio and live versions), criticism of misleading movie trailers, and poor movie endings.  Finally, the MyFi XM radio device was promoted.


A segment centered on listener calls suggesting outrageous things they’d do to win a MyFi, ranging from eating nightcrawlers and goldfish, enduring Jim Norton's farts, to self-administered vomit enemas and wearing soiled underwear on their heads.  A significant portion focused on planning "Cherry Darts," a contest involving throwing cherries at a woman's buttocks, with detailed discussions about logistics, contestant selection (30-50 people), the involvement of a West Coast porn star, and judging criteria.  Concerns about crowd control were raised.

Larry the Cable Guy called in and discussed his career, audience experiences (including a story about an elk shot at an Elks Lodge), and the lack of political correctness in the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.  The conversation included racist and misogynistic jokes, discussion of a previous pre-chewed food skit, and a debate on the definition of "noodling."  More planning for "Cherry Darts" and further discussion about the show's audience and guest appearances concluded this segment.


A later segment featured Larry the Cable Guy as a guest, discussing his career, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour's success (attributed to its lack of political correctness), negative experiences with critics, positive audience reception, and extensively on Hooters and Wing House, with commentary on waitress attire.  The conversation frequently veered into sexually explicit territory, including discussions of fellatio, "bullnuts," and other crude humor.  Numerous offensive listener calls were taken, and the hosts and Larry discussed various television shows (*The Apprentice*, *The Swan*) with crude, often misogynistic commentary.  Larry promoted his Comedy Central roast of Jeff Foxworthy, his tour, and merchandise.  The segment concluded with more vulgar jokes, promotion of Larry's projects, complaints about XM radio and Howard Stern, and a discussion of the perceived hypocrisy of Hollywood elites.


The show continued with a rendition of "America, Fuck Yeah," followed by a list of random items punctuated with "fuck yeah."  An anecdote about a construction worker and exposed breasts was shared. An XM commercial aired. A caller shared his fifty-year smoking history and quit attempt.  The conversation shifted to a documentary on a man claiming to understand whale communication.  Larry the Cable Guy reappeared as a guest.  Anthony’s expensive haircut appointment at John Sahag was discussed, focusing on his discomfort with male hair washers.  A story about Rob Reiner and a "How's Your News" segment featuring individuals with intellectual disabilities were covered.  The Don Imus nanny lawsuit (involving a cap gun and pocket knife) was speculated upon.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering massages, haircuts, and personal experiences.  A listener call-in game, “What did we learn?”, concluded the show, along with further discussion about XM Radio and Don Imus's personality.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, we're back live in New York.  Pay attention.  They spark controversy.  Fuck you!  Being able to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight, kid.  Jesus fucking Christ!  One of the biggest fines in FCC history has slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You've got a couple of great guys over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money. 
[00:06:30]  Yay, man!  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to meet a passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls by all...  What kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:07:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Hey-yoo!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Put it out of that person, pie!  Sorry, Jelly, don't obstruct!  It's over, Johnny.  I'm Big Dick Black.  He was banging cocktail waves.  Two at a time.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look what they call him. 
[00:07:30]  Put it on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Fall around like a dog!  You're just a tool.  You're just a tool.  And welcome to the ONA show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hola.  On this rainy morning in New York City.  Yeah.  Look, it's awful here in New York City today. 
[00:08:00]  Absolutely awful.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yeah, but, you know, it's going to be a little rough today.  Well, not really.  It's a national radio show.  Oh, that's true.  You know, that slips my mind every so often.  Somewhere it's going to be nice and sunny and warm and perfect for wowing.  Somewhere.  That's what I love about doing a national radio show.  Whip Em Out Wednesday, the greatest radio promotion ever!  Ever.  And it's so simple.  You put a wow on your car or the back of your truck.  We don't care if it's the official Opie and Anthony wow bumper sticker or a homemade wow sign. 
[00:08:30]  Or, you know, you truckers just love riding crap in the back of your truck.  Could you boost me a little?  Yeah, I don't know what the hell happens every morning.  I need a little boost.  I don't have any volume.  How's that?  Ah, that's better in my head.  All right.  Sorry about that.  So then you've got the wow in your car, and if the ladies feel like it, they're going  to flash their boobs at you as you're driving around on the highways and the byways.  It works awesome.  Works like a charm.  I was going to say it works like a charm, but I say that all the time.  Works like a charm.  I was trying to come up with something new, and I just failed miserably. 
[00:09:00]  Nothing.  Could I have said awesomely?  Works awesomely?  Works awesomely.  Not even a word?  I don't know.  Half the crap I say is not even a word.  And my talking is going to be worse than usual today.  Why's that?  Oh, I bit the side of my mouth.  Oh, now it swells up, so you bite it every time you chew something.  Yeah, and it takes weeks to heal.  Yeah, you just have to not eat for about a week.  That's great.  Or eat a lot of this stupid oatmeal.  Your oatmeal.  You know what, Ed?  It's really early, and I think it would be very effective if we played that drop acid 
[00:09:30]  PSA right away.  Oh, yeah.  I like this one.  Well, every day we're finding stuff that we used to play on the old show.  You know, we forgot about a lot of things because we were off the air for two years and we weren't  able to take any of our stuff with us.  So slowly but surely, we're rebuilding the show.  Yeah.  And it's been kind of fun to rediscover things, you know?  I know.  We hadn't heard them in quite a while.  Didn't have them. 
[00:10:00]  And now they're just turning up.  What, do people send these in?  Or is Eric finding them?  Well, Eric is amazing.  Sex Bagel does a great job for the radio show.  And then the listeners are just taking it upon themselves going, God, I can't believe they  don't have this clip and they're not playing it yet.  And they're sending in stuff all the time.  You know, we've said over the years that the Opie and Anthony show is truly the people's  radio program.  Yes.  You know, when we start sucking, you know, that's when the listeners need to do their  part.  Oh, I thought you were going to blame them.  Yeah.  Well, in a way, I am. 
[00:10:30]  When they start sucking, it's your fault for not sending us stuff.  Well, they participate in the show and, you know, sometimes we need them a little more  than usual, right?  Right.  You know, maybe today we just tell the listeners, hey, this is your show today.  What do you want to hear?  Ooh.  What do you want to do with this program today?  That's really giving them a lot of responsibility.  A lot of responsibility.  What would they ask for?  I know what these sick fucks would ask for.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of sex.  A lot of girls playing with themselves, which is just fine by me. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, so we got the drop acid PSA.  I hadn't heard this in quite some time.  This was something that came out, I guess, in the early 70s, maybe?  Yeah, when they were putting out a lot of PSAs about drugs, drug use.  Can't have your kid doing drugs.  So they figured that if a young person was telling people what it was like to do drugs  and how bad it was, that maybe your kid wouldn't do drugs.  Right.  And I think the scenario is this lady is kind of hanging out in San Francisco. 
[00:11:30]  San Francisco.  Is Market Street in San Francisco?  I don't even know.  Yeah, I think so, right?  Yeah.  Anyone?  Bueller?  Yeah.  Anyone?  Anyone?  My brother's giving a thumbs up, so I guess so.  So this is an example of why you shouldn't drop acid.  Right.  Because drop acid was all the rage back in the early 70s.  Dropping acid.  But they also kind of hint that marijuana might be a stepping stone.  Yeah, it starts with marijuana and ends with acid.  Acid.  So this thing made us, I don't know, laugh pretty hard this morning as we were preparing 
[00:12:00]  for the show.  And I think it's something you should play real early while people are still kind of waking  up and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's kind of creepy, too, you know, the sound effects and stuff.  The bad 60s and early 70s sound effects.  Right.  Check this out.  The synthesizer.  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was 
[00:12:30]  curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever.  But I kept sitting there waiting and waiting, and nothing was happening.  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green  and brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog. 
[00:13:00]  Uh-oh.  She decides to buy a hot dog.  Hippie chick in her pink capris.  Little top.  God damn hippies.  With her little hairy armpits.  Oh, you know, she's just a mess.  Going out for a hot dog.  And she's a stringy-haired, greasy, hippie mess back then.  And she leaves the house, and she's probably not tripping that much yet.  Yeah.  Probably thinking, hey, this is not that bad after all.  Not bad.  It's just a little stronger than marijuana, but I think I can handle myself. 
[00:13:30]  I'm going to hit the streets of San Francisco and get myself a hot dog.  My 70s Earth Mama Muff was pushing out my capris.  Right.  Big friggin' brillo pads.  Looked like I was smuggling a yo-yo in my capris.  All right.  So she's stepping out to get her hot dog.  Okay.  So far, so good, right?  No problem.  She probably has the munchies from all the drug abuse.  From the pot.  There you go.  And I decided to buy a hot dog. 
[00:14:00]  Flying saucer came down.  What was that?  Yeah, it sounds like Ed Wood.  Yeah.  Cut.  Perfect.  Perfect.  I was very hungry.  And I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual.  And I put the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said, 
[00:14:30]  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said, No.  He said, Don't be a bummer.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.  That's the sound effect of a scream back in the early 70s?  What the hell is that?  The Moog synthesizer.  I think it would have been much more effective if it was an actual scream, the hot dog screaming at her.  But instead, they go with the sound effects. 
[00:15:00]  I backed up a little bit.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  Uh-oh.  What kind of face do you think was on the hot dog?  On the hot dog.  A little smiley wiener face.  What kind of, what was it?  Then I realized it wasn't a hot dog at all.  It was my friend Terry's cock. 
[00:15:30]  I put it up to my mouth, and it spit at me.  You know Terry's having a good time, right?  He's in San Francisco.  Yeah, Terry's a professional.  Summer of love.  He's like, hey, he found a new broad.  Right.  He's thinking, hey, she can handle the acid like me.  Free love.  We'll do a little acid.  We'll go back to my pad and bang.  Yeah, we're going to eat some hot dogs, and she's going to eat my hot dog.  Right.  Yeah.  Under the black lights with the lava lamps rocking. 
[00:16:00]  This hippie bitch is ready to screw it all up.  Jefferson Airplane playing in the background, White Rabbit.  Of course it is.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, man.  But this broad is a buzz kill.  She's a bummer.  She's a real bummer.  She's seen faces in a hot dog.  In a hot dog.  The summer of love.  Come on.  She's supposed to have a good time at San Francisco in the 60s, man.  Right.  Who sees faces in a hot dog?  Except this bitch.  Terry out.  Eyes, nose, a mouth. 
[00:16:30]  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  Redhead.  Right about now, Terry's like, oh, great.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm going to have to babysit this acid head.  Right.  She's having a bad trip.  I'm going to go to Haight-Asbury and see if there's any other broads I can pick up.  Nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him. 
[00:17:00]  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.  And I stood there with his hot dog and asked Terry, do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  What kind of answer is that?  Hot dog's talking to me?  Nah.  Nah.  Let's get out of here.  Let's screw.  Right.  Let's ball.  That's why he said, nah, let's get out of here.  He's thinking in his head, all right, she's ready for some action.  He knows she's just going to ruin everything.  The guy gave her the acid, so he's like, he had the acid, probably used to it. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Knows how to do it and have a good goddamn time doing it.  And she is just wrecking.  You know he looked over and she said the hot dog's talking and he's, oh, it's a babysitting session now.  But that's why he wants to get out of there.  He thinks he can get one in before she really crashes.  Quick, let's go back to my place.  We'll ball, man.  And then, you know, everything will be groovy.  Don't worry about it.  And then we'll crash.  Yeah.  And the hot dog admits he has a wife and seven kids. 
[00:18:00]  I wonder if he spoke any Mexican accent.  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, look at the thing.  He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over and he got on the same trip that I was on.  Thanks.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating, so I put it in my mouth and bit down. 
[00:18:30]  It turns into a horror movie.  You know something?  Perhaps if you're on acid and your hot dog is talking to you, even if you realize you're hallucinating and, like, you kind of talk yourself down a little bit, perhaps you should just write off eating the hot dog.  You know what I mean?  Like, you kind of reach the point where you're like, look, I'm hallucinating.  The hot dog isn't really talking to me. 
[00:19:00]  Perhaps I should put the hot dog down, though, and walk away.  Right.  Not bite it.  You will let me know if that hot dog stops screaming.  God.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, my goodness.  I got to hear the scream.  So it screamed.  Listen to this again.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town. 
[00:19:30]  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  You had to.  That wasn't a hot dog.  That was Terry's cock.  Terry.  That was Terry screaming.  That was Terry screaming.  You weren't standing on Market Street.  You were back in the room.  And the hot dog only had one eye, you ass.  And you only thought it was sauerkraut because he hasn't washed his pubes in a few weeks.  Hippie dirtbag.  Relish and sauerkraut.  I put it in my mouth and bit down.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  It was about this time.  I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  It was about this time I realized that I forgot about the turkey in the oven at the house I was babysitting the baby at.  When I opened the oven, I was horrified.  I went back up to the crib and there was a turkey in the crib.  Where was the baby? 
[00:20:30]  That old gag.  Oh, man.  I wish I lived during the acid years.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  Sounds like a great time.  Talking hot dog.  Right.  She bit my hot dog.  Terry punched me in the face and poured hot coffee on my tits.  That must have been so funny to watch. 
[00:21:00]  So, this chick, like, dude, you should have seen what I saw today on Market Street.  This chick, like, she was kind of hot, hippie chick, but she looked pretty fucked up.  And she's like, gets a hot dog and starts eating it.  And then, dude, she's talking to it.  She starts talking to it. 
[00:21:30]  And then, all of a sudden, she starts jumping up and down on it, screaming and running away.  It was great.  You should have seen it.  She freaked out.  Acid sounds great.  Yeah, it sure does.  And that's how it ends.  Her just running down the street screaming.  Running down Market Street screaming with hot dog on her shoe.  And I guess then the PSA just said, don't do acid.  Don't do acid?  Something like that.  Is that it?  I don't know.  They have a clever slogan?  Who knows?  I know.  I did mescaline.  That's about the only kind of acid type stuff I did.  Shrooms, bro.  Come on. 
[00:22:00]  Shrooms.  Never did the shrooms.  I was a mescaline guy back, I guess, when...  Back in California?  No, no, no.  It was when Van Halen...  I forgot what Van Halen album it was.  But it was definitely David Lee Roth.  And I went to the Nassau Coliseum.  And I took some mescaline with my friends.  And we were going to watch Van Halen.  And everyone was peeking, dude.  Everyone was peeking, except me.  I'm just sitting through the concert, you know, having a good time and stuff.  And then all of a sudden, David Lee Roth started screaming. 
[00:22:30]  So I went...  I was the designated driver.  Because I wasn't...  You're the designated driver and you're on mescaline.  But I wasn't feeling anything.  Everyone else is laughing their ass off.  Because mescaline just makes you laugh at everything.  It's very funny.  And I figured, you know, I'd drive.  You know, because I drove there.  And I...  Who am I saying designated driver?  I drove there.  I was driving back regardless of how fucked up I was.  We all get to the car.  And hop in.  It's raining. 
[00:23:00]  So we start driving out of the parking lot.  And I noticed the windshield wipers are starting to really get loud.  And I'm really noticing them.  Oh, you're completely focused on them?  Oh, man.  And I couldn't stop thinking about the windshield wipers.  Was it going in slow motion, too?  It started.  Then the taillights of all the cars...  Because, you know, I was just getting out of a concert.  All you see are taillights everywhere.  And the way they were kind of...  The light of the taillight was being diffused on the drops on my windshield. 
[00:23:30]  And the windshield wipers going back and forth.  And they were kind of going in slow motion.  And now the red taillights in the wipers were making these streamer kind of stretched out red colors.  And the sound was just really getting...  With the red lights going.  And I'm sitting there.  And all of a sudden, I just started going...  And the guys in the car are like, dude, you all right?  I'm like, yeah.  Fine, man. 
[00:24:00]  They're like, oh, Andy, he's fucked up, man.  Don't worry about it.  And I drove home.  It all of a sudden turns into a Cheech and Chong movie for you.  I was driving down the parkway.  Yeah.  And laughing.  Didn't know if I was doing 80 or 8 miles an hour.  No clue.  Had no clue.  And that was my mescaline time at Van Halen.  But, you know, that kind of stuff, if you don't let it run away on you, it's kind of fun.  It is fun until you see faces in the hot dog. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Once you start getting hot dogs telling you to have families and then biting it and it's screaming,  that would freak you out a little bit.  I know I ate glowing french fries when we went back down to the pizza place we all worked at.  And there were french fries underneath the heat lamp in the kitchen area.  And we all came back from the concert, went to the restaurant we worked at because we get free food.  And we went into the kitchen.  And the french fries, I started eating them off the rack up top.  It was under the heat light. 
[00:25:00]  And they were glowing like Marcellus Wallace's suitcase when John Travolta opened it up.  It glowed like that.  And I kept eating them.  And that kind of freaked me out a little bit because I thought I was going to have some kind of radiation in my stomach.  But no talking hot dog, just glowing french fries.  With a face and seven kids.  Seven kids.  That's hilarious.  I wasn't screaming down Jericho Turnpike with french fry on my shoe.  Well, there you have it, the drop acid PSA.  Yeah.  We forgot all about that.  Nice.  That thing. 
[00:25:30]  Groovy.  Yeah, that was a trippy time back then, huh?  Have some acid, baby.  Yeah.  John in New York wants in.  Hey, John, what's up?  Yeah, you guys are talking about this.  I'm driving in the rain with the rain falling on my windshield.  I'm starting to go into an acid flashback.  Ah.  People really have flashbacks, though.  Who knows?  I don't know anyone who's ever had an acid flashback.  She probably did.  Yeah, let's go to...  Every time she eats a hot dog.  Oh, let's go to Montgomery, Alabama.  Alabama. 
[00:26:00]  Robert, what's up?  Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener.  That's what I'd really like to be.  I think I'll love you.  All right, there you go.  Singing right before she bit its head off with the red ketchup-y hair.  Yeah, how does ketchup turn into hair?  What does a hot dog with seven kids say?  Don't eat me.  That's what I was saying.  Freaking her out.  I'm just making my coffee.  Oh, you're almost done with your oatmeal.  I know. 
[00:26:30]  Did it have a little conversation with you?  I said, don't eat me.  I stink.  I'm a gluey mess.  I look like placenta.  Throw me out.  That was yesterday's.  All right, well...  There's little raisins in it.  We really have a lot to do.  We should take our first break and then tell you all the fun stuff we're going to do today.  The raisins look like cockroaches.  Right.  And I think we're taking a request today.  Well, we are.  Yeah, we wanted to get the listeners involved today.  All righty.  So, if you want to hear something or you need an update on something, you know, you guys 
[00:27:00]  get to control the show a little bit today.  How's that sound?  All right?  Don't blow it.  Don't blow it is right.  We'll go to California and talk to Eldon.  Yeah.  Hello?  What's going on, Eldon?  Oh, I'm sitting over here in Idaho.  I'm a truck driver.  Of course you are.  You need to play that song, The Police Got My Car.  Oh, you like that one?  Oh, Police Got My Car? 
[00:27:30]  That song rocks, man.  So do you guys.  All right.  I laughed so hard the other day when I heard that, and I've been trying to sing it, and  I got...  Oh, boy.  Where can I get it at?  Wow.  You have it on your webpage or something?  Yes.  So you can get it from eatabullet.com.  Oh, man.  No, no, no.  Don't listen.  That's Jimmy's website.  Of a website.  Well, this is Brother Joe's song.  I don't know where you can get Brother Joe's songs.  I'll find out, and we'll mention it on the radio, okay?  Yeah, because... 
[00:28:00]  Oh, boy, Eldon.  That was your cue to say thank you.  That was your cue to say thank you.  Yeah, because...  Eldon, we're going to play it for you right now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  A listener request as we go to break.  Hey, man.  You want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean, the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass.  The police, they got my car.  Dude, I can't believe the police got your car.  Ah, shut up, man. 
[00:28:30]  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Police got my car while I was driving home from the bar.  Dude, that really sucks.  Police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got my car while I was driving drunk from the bar.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas. 
[00:29:00]  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  So I can go drink at the bar.  Oh, boy.  Son of a bitch, I want my...  All right, where's the music behind this song?  We're not hearing it.  We're not hearing it at all.  Sex bagel!  What happened?  That's the mono version.  I have one other disc with the same exact song you can try, but that's the same thing that's...  Why don't we hear the music, then?  I have no idea.  It was combined.  It can't be the mono version.  Mono, you would hear both? 
[00:29:30]  Hang on one second.  That's something screwy.  What are you doing?  He's going to get another copy of this?  Out of phase, as they say?  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Wayne.  Hey, Wayne, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted...  You know, there's a big football game this Sunday.  You know, Packers-Eagles?  Yeah.  On national TV?  Yeah.  I was...  You know, make a shout-out to all those Philadelphia fans, man.  You know, make an ONA sign, and you know, when there's, like, extra points or field goals,  you know, ONA sign up, you know? 
[00:30:00]  Guys sitting in the end zone, there's got to be an ONA fan.  Yeah, we definitely want you guys to start attacking the media with the Opie and Anthony signs,  XM satellite signs, you know, so far, so far, we've had a couple here and there, but we  need some nice exposure from the fans.  I think I'm going to that game with our old friend Joey there.  Really?  Yeah.  That's going to be a blast.  I think I'm taking a road trip to Philly to check out that game this Sunday.  That is going to be a blast.  That game is going to be so much fun.  Yeah, go Eagles.  All right, Wayne, thank you. 
[00:30:30]  All right, take care.  Yeah, we're definitely looking for people to hold up signs, you know, on live TV and things  like that to get the word out that we're back doing the satellite radio thing, right?  We used to do it at WWF all the time at the wrestling events.  Yes, they did.  We had a couple of signs right off the bat when we first started with XM satellite radio,  so hopefully we'll get more as the weeks go on here.  We like them in the live news shots.  That's my personal favorite because it's very unexpected and no one really ever does it.  You see a live shot happening, news is being made.  Jot something down and get behind the person that's on the street with the microphone. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  This is called Filler because we're trying to get a better version of that song,  but I don't know if it's going to happen.  So we'll play something else and we'll get the Police Got Your Car on a little later.  We'll get a good version.  What do you got there, Sex Bagel?  Steve's going to work on it one more time.  We'll try a new mix of it.  We don't know why, but it was all mixed down from the stereo version that Joe had down to  a mono version, and I think it ran once and it was fine. 
[00:31:30]  And why are we playing mono versions?  Because some people's units don't pick up the stereo crap?  If the audio is split between left and right, when it goes through the satellite, they only  hear one side of it.  Well, some people.  Not everybody, but some people.  I don't get it.  All right.  All right.  Well, you know what?  We'll play this instead.  Today is World AIDS Day, Anthony.  It is.  It's World AIDS Day.  What are you supposed to do for that?  I have no idea.  Come up with a cure? 
[00:32:00]  Should we be home?  I think you're supposed to have sex with a Haitian today.  Oh, that's a negative stereotype.  That's great.  Well, in honor of that, from Team America, here's a little cute song about AIDS.  Uh-huh.  We'll play this one instead.  We'll be back.  And so this is the end of our story, and everyone is dead from AIDS. 
[00:32:30]  It took from me my best friend, my only true pal, my only bright star.  He's not a hero.  Well, I'm gonna march on Washington, lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS. 
[00:33:00]  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma and my dark old blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The pope has got it and so do you.  Come on, everybody.  We got quilting to do.  We're gonna break down these barricades.  Everyone has AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  It was Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway. 
[00:33:30]  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.

[00:38:00]  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting.  I'm waiting for a time.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  It's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[00:38:30]  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication does that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  It's okay.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you the medication, okay?  The medications don't work. 
[00:39:00]  I'm going to get this place.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  I would hit him over the head with a chair.  No, that's not the Bellevue clip.  That's Jimmy from our meeting yesterday on the phone, our conference call.  That was a good one yesterday.  You're our secret weapon, by the way.  We do these conference calls once a week, and we get absolutely nothing accomplished.  We just talk about stuff we talked about last week.  Yeah.  And, oh, I don't have an answer on this.  I don't have an answer on that.  Well, I'll get back to you on that one.  We'll circle back on this one. 
[00:39:30]  We haven't booskied this yet.  It's still baking.  Nothing gets accomplished.  Just week after week after week after week.  It's all about what we talked about the week prior.  And, you know, I guess I should let Jimmy know they don't want you in those meetings anymore  because you're the pain in the ass guy.  Norton is becoming proactive with the program.  I kind of like it.  Because Anthony and I, by 10, 15, you know, we've been through this BS for so many years.  We just stare at the phone and listen or fall asleep against the wall. 
[00:40:00]  You know what I learned yesterday on our meeting?  I learned that the building next door has an awning that is held on by these clamps that  I couldn't quite figure out how they attach to the side of the building.  That's what I learned.  You were looking out the window the whole time.  I was fascinated by these clamps that are holding this awning lighting system on.  Yeah, but you're our secret weapon.  We figure a couple more of those conference calls and they're going to go, you know, guys,  I think we're done with the conference calls. 
[00:40:30]  I think everything is working just fine.  Everything's fine.  Thank you.  You guys just do what you do and we'll do what we do down here and that's it.  And it's all because of Norton because he gets right in their faces, which I love, which  I absolutely love.  It's not about either XM.  It's all companies.  Anytime there's like a corporate structure, there's the problem because you got 50 guys  doing it.  It's like just fucking somebody do it.  It's every company you work for you're going to have that.  Thank God we're good at what we do because I can't even imagine, you know, living in that  corporate atmosphere. 
[00:41:00]  I just can't imagine and thank God we're, you know, probably, I don't know, halfway through  our careers, hopefully.  So, you know, because radio in general is getting more and more corporate every day.  So thank God, you know, we got 10 years behind us, maybe a few more ahead of us and then  we could kind of retire and move on before this gets completely ridiculous.  My favorite parts of the meeting yesterday were after Jim spoke, the response.  It was, yeah, Jim gets right up to it and it's like, um, uh, we spoke to a booker last 
[00:41:30]  week.  I just wondered, how's that going?  How's that going?  Insert big long gap here.  Um, yeah, well, I'll get back to you on that.  We'll get back to you.  And during the gap, you know, they're just looking at each other, mouthing, that mother  fucker.  Yeah.  That pain in the ass.  That pain in the ass, Jimmy Norton. 
[00:42:00]  Who the fuck is he?  Why doesn't he just shut up?  Who knew you'd be the pain in the ass in those meetings?  Usually I'm the aggressor, but, you know, I, I, I yell from the back of the room and you  get right up to the thing.  Yeah, we are.  Jim's right in the phone.  It's like tonguing the phone.  But I'm not rude to people.  I'm not rude to people.  I'm not like an ass to people.  And that's what sucks.  That's why.  You're much too polite as you twist the screw.  I, I'm not in a position.  I just want you to, it's like anytime we complain here, it's not a, it's like people here want 
[00:42:30]  the show to succeed.  Everybody wants to succeed.  It's about stuff to make the show better.  Right.  More than succeed.  I mean, we want to be where we were two and a half years ago.  We got a long ways to go.  We know we're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history, but I'm learning things.  I'm, I don't think their goals for this show are as big as ours.  I have to say that today.  I just don't think they are.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing they're really, really happy with the amount of subscribers that are signing  up for our, our channel and all that.  I'm not happy with the amount of subscribers that have signed up for the channel thus far, 
[00:43:00]  but I guess, uh, their projections for how many people were going to sign up for this  show before the end of the year.  We're way past that.  So they're happy, but we're way below what, where I want to be.  Of course.  And that lies the problem.  So I want to be millions.  Oh yeah.  All of a sudden, uh, you know, we're not getting as much attention anymore because you know,  we're doing our job.  So, so they would rather use their efforts for, for something else, uh, you know, on, 
[00:43:30]  uh, on XM satellite radio, you know, take the efforts and, and move it somewhere else  that might need a little more help.  Well, then that, let me bring up again yesterday's meeting.  Um, do you know, they installed five new windows on that building across the alley and it must  have been after they built it because the bricks around it were a different color than the rest  of the building.  Well, this is December 1st, right?  Today?  Yes, it is.  Oh, let me.  So we've been, um, at this two months officially.  Wow.  We've done two months of radio.  And I'm spent.  And you know what? 
[00:44:00]  And this is, you know, I could point out things that, that's, you know, we still don't have  an office.  We just don't have an office.  But they're working on it.  It just amazes me.  We still don't have an office to go to after the show with phone lines that we could use  and, and, uh, yeah, we have the office and computers that we could use, you know, because  we're still getting kicked out of all the, all these cubicles around 1030, 11 o'clock  or what have you, because they're, you know, we're using other people's desks.  Yeah.  So the only computers we can use are theirs and they, they come in and do their thing.  We need an office. 
[00:44:30]  So, I mean, as we move forward, I, I will just bitch about the things that are facts.  The facts are we still don't have an office two months into this gig.  It just amazes me.  It absolutely amazes me because there's no level of accountability.  And this, again, all corporations fucking do this.  It's people's way of just hiding out.  You got 50 guys.  Oh, I'll talk to him.  Let's get back to him.  Not one person can go.  All right, let me get this done.  It's a fucking circular nightmare in any corporation.  They're awful.  Nothing got done in the meeting.  Once again, yesterday, it was all about, I'll get back to you. 
[00:45:00]  I'll get back to you.  We'll circle back on that.  Well, I don't have an answer on that.  You know, if that's going to be the meetings every week, then let's end them right now.  We don't need them.  You know what happens when the show sucks?  Everybody knows whose fault it is.  Right.  It's Ben.  You know?  I asked for a little thing for Ben.  It's got to be three weeks ago, easily, to make his job easier.  What, a comb?  And, you know, he's still waiting for it. 
[00:45:30]  A little trio, so he can check his email on the fly and stuff.  Aw.  Because, you know, we all know he's a social butterfly.  Oh, all the guys got trios, right?  I love the trio.  I don't have one.  And I got them.  And you're not going to get anything.  I don't want a trio.  You won't get anything.  All right, enough of that.  They hate me.  But it was a very funny conference call.  You know they're walking around going, who is he?  What does he fucking do?  Why is he bringing this up?  Like, all right, we'll pay him, but what does he want? 
[00:46:00]  No, that's why we like that you work on this show.  You're as motivated as Ant and I.  You want to be the, I mean, all kidding aside, you're listening to three guys on mic right now  that want to be the best as they can be.  Simple as that.  We want to be known as the best radio show in all of radio.  Nice.  Where is Poe today?  Poe's around.  He's kind of, you know, he's kind of keeping to himself today.  Oh, thanks, fella.  He's kind of keeping to himself today. 
[00:46:30]  So that's that, I guess.  Yeah.  For now.  Yeah.  Another meeting.  Oh, they've had enough of me, though.  They certainly have.  And it's not even anything big.  Again, there's no rudeness.  There's no, like, what the fuck, dude?  And I got a call.  You think it's productive that we have all those people on the conference call every week?  I'm like, definitely.  They're basically hinting, does Jim really have to be part of that conference call thing?  Yeah, you should just put on a tie and do nothing.  They'd be more than happy to have me on the conference call.  Why wouldn't it be worthwhile to have everyone involved in the program in those meetings? 
[00:47:00]  I don't understand why we wouldn't have everybody.  So you and I are like old, beaten dogs.  We've heard all this crap for so many years that we're like, oh, whatever.  And to have, like, a fresh, young face like Jim Norton.  Oh, fresh, young, go-getter.  Just young, appley-cheeked and ready to...  Still new to the business of radio.  Don't worry.  Give it another year or two.  You'll be as bitter as Anthony and I.  Oh, dude, I...  Because it's the most...  Disgusting.  It's the most amazing business out there.  I don't care if it's satellite radio, regular radio, CB radio, ham radio. 
[00:47:30]  It's a cluster F.  Yes.  The things that I've seen over the years, it just blows my mind.  It blows my mind.  There he is.  But if you were screaming for a leather couch instead of the one you have, that's like just  bellyaching and sniveling.  But when you're asking, like, oh, we'd like an office or a phone, that's, like, pretty  legitimate things to ask for to do a radio show.  It's not like you're asking for anything crazy.  You know, little things.  I'm just pointing out we're two months into the gig, and there you go. 
[00:48:00]  But we still...  The office still isn't really complete, you know.  Are we going to get yelled at now?  Probably.  Because this is considered complaining.  Probably.  Why are we just talking?  No.  No, it's complaining.  Oh, don't complain.  We're not supposed to.  Okay.  We're supposed to just keep these to ourselves.  I asked about the cameras that are in the studio, because we want to, you know, get  these online for the fans.  Yeah, we'll get back.  And I know I asked weeks ago, easily.  And, well, I don't have an answer on that either.  They didn't have an answer for anything yesterday.  Not one question answered. 
[00:48:30]  So why, you know, why are we even doing the meetings?  That's all.  Things have to be run through a few people.  Anthony, moving on.  There you go.  We did 10 minutes of bitching today instead of an hour and a half.  That's all.  Anthony, moving on.  You were just up in arms about Lacey Peterson's mom today.  Oh, boy.  This is the big story, I guess.  One of the big stories today in the New York...  Well, probably in all the papers.  Well, it's the sentencing...  Is it in the Daily News?  Huh?  I'm sorry.  I was asking Anthony.  We're looking.  Yeah, it's in there somewhere.  The sentencing phase of the Scott Peterson trial. 
[00:49:00]  Of course, he was found guilty of murdering, murdering his wife, Lacey, and their unborn child, Connor.  Why does that kid have a name, technically?  I mean, I don't want to seem cold and...  Well, there's a lot of people out there that name their kids before they're born.  Yeah.  Yeah, but...  Well, that's a whole other issue.  Screw it.  I just don't think, you know, you should be talking about little Connor like it's a little walking toddler that he could drink also. 
[00:49:30]  Maybe name him Saved Money on College Tuition.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know.  Lacey's mom, Sharon...  Sharon!  She was able to voice her rage in a court.  You know how they do that?  They parade the family around.  They yell and scream at the guy that murdered the person, the perp.  And it's used to maybe get a stiffer sentence on the guy. 
[00:50:00]  Well, he's either going to get life in prison or the death penalty.  So she was really screaming, hoping that he gets the death penalty.  And literally, she was screaming in the courtroom at him.  You know when the family of the person that was killed gets right in the killer's face and starts screaming?  It's just one of those moments you just don't want to be witness to.  One of those very uncomfortable, primal...  Like the hot dog biting scream. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, the Godzilla scream.  Godzilla scream.  The end of the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers scream.  The De Niro Mean Streets scream.  Right!  Just these screams.  And she was doing that.  And then she screams out.  She wanted to be a mother.  Divorce is always an option, not murder.  Well, Sharon, sometimes it's not an option. 
[00:51:00]  I think part of the blame...  Yeah, you've got to blame Scott Peterson.  He's the one that did it.  But you've got to think what drove him to that.  Why wasn't divorce an option?  Perhaps you should be screaming at some of these scumbag lawyers and the legal system when it comes to divorce.  Huh?  So you're saying he was justified?  Uh, no.  But again, I don't understand.  There is... 
[00:51:30]  Look, the laws are so crazy that sometimes she screams, she's screaming, divorce is an option, not murder.  She goes, divorce is always an option, not murder.  It's really not an option for most guys.  It isn't an option.  I mean, they go through it, but then their lives suffer.  They're in hell.  You don't make a lot of money, and now you've got to give half your stuff away and half your money.  Forget about the stuff.  You can always get new stuff.  It's no problem getting a new bedroom set and kitchen table.  You know, give that stuff away.  Fine.  A lot of guys don't care. 
[00:52:00]  Take the stuff.  Take the car.  Take it.  Take it.  It's the fact that now, while you go to work every day, that half of your money is now going to another person that you aren't even involved with anymore.  That's the issue.  That's not an option.  There are so many guys that you talk to that go, I'd love to get a divorce.  I can't stand my wife.  I'm living with someone I hate, and I cannot get a divorce.  Why?  I go broke.  I go broke.  I can't afford it. 
[00:52:30]  Men are then put in a position where they have to live with someone they can't stand because they can't afford to get a divorce.  This guy, all right, fine.  A little selfishness going in there.  He just wanted to go out and bang broads and not be married anymore, I guess.  Maybe he didn't want to be a father anymore.  And it would have been a lot easier if the laws weren't stacked against guys to file for divorce.  See you later.  But it's not an option always.  It's not always an option. 
[00:53:00]  Perhaps some of our outrage should be at the lawyers that prey on men.  In divorces and just divorce law in general.  Is it true if you get divorced and your wife never remarries that she now gets your Social Security when you retire?  Or half of it?  Half your Social Security?  Or a part of it?  Yeah.  How does that ever make sense?  It doesn't make sense.  There's no reason that a guy should be broke because the marriage didn't work out. 
[00:53:30]  Just stop already.  However, in this case, a guy who knocks up, if you leave a pregnant woman like when she's ready to drop, you've got to expect a big piece of your salary is going to come out.  However, as opposed to being when you're single and she's got no kids and you have no kids and you're both earning, that's where the divorce law is.  Well, you know something?  He should obviously pay for her pregnancy and pay child support because it is his kid.  I'm not going there.  I'm not saying be a deadbeat dad or leave a pregnant woman that can't work, leave her under those situations. 
[00:54:00]  No.  Should he then pay her for 10, 20 years?  No!  Get a fucking job!  Work!  I mean, you make a good point, but obviously he was a kook.  He's a scumbag.  He's a scumbag.  And, you know, no.  Should he murder her?  Absolutely not.  But the mother...  There's a but.  The mother can't be screaming that divorce is always an option. 
[00:54:30]  It's not.  It's not.  She should have just as well have said, staying with her and being miserable is always an option.  Because that's more of an option, because that's what more guys do.  All right, let's go to Kevin.  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Love the show.  Ah, thank you.  I've been divorced twice.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a sucker.  But neither one of them wanted to be married to me, and I'm the one that had to start the proceedings, get the lawyer and all that.  It's just ridiculous.  And then, even though you started the proceedings, you still got screwed. 
[00:55:00]  I got screwed.  But one of them actually cheated, and she just wanted to stay latched on.  And it was like, you're both ridiculous.  It's like, if you want out of the marriage, just fucking divorce me.  Get it done.  Why aren't there lawyers out there trying to take care of this problem?  Because it's obviously a problem that the men get screwed into divorces.  There are lawyers, but their hands are tied behind their back.  They can do nothing because of the law, the way it is.  The system, the way...  It's not even the law.  It's the judges are so lazy.  These judges don't want to hear anything new. 
[00:55:30]  Believe me, I've been through it.  I've stood there in the courtroom.  Thinking to myself, all right, the judge will be able to understand this situation.  I will tell the judge, convey to her how I got this career, who was responsible for  me being in radio, the talents that I've had, whatever they are, that I've cultivated since  I was a kid.  I've been like this ever since I was a kid.  You know, it's not something I learned, something somebody taught me, something that I was inspired 
[00:56:00]  by somebody that I was married to.  No.  The reason I'm in radio, there's certain people that were there that helped me along, and  certain people that had nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  Maybe if Opie took me to court, he could, you know, get half.  But maybe if my brother took me to court, he could get half.  But it had, you know, it had nothing to do with certain other people that all of a sudden...  She was claiming that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, this is what ex-wives will do in the courtroom. 
[00:56:30]  No matter what the guy is doing, and how he's earning his living, she will present the  case that she was responsible for where he is.  I wish that case went further, because I would have...  No!  No, I'm just saying, I would have been a witness proving...  But that's what I'm saying!  ...proving that she was actually more of a hindrance than actually a help in your effing  career.  That's what I'm saying!  It doesn't matter!  Because the judges don't care about that!  They're lazy!  It's not anything new! 
[00:57:00]  You think you're going to be Perry Mason and go in there and give this testimony, and  the judge is going to sit there and look and ponder it and go, yeah, he's right!  It's all cookie-cutter bullshit!  And the judge already makes up their mind, and they would rather you settle it!  They don't even want to make a decision!  But it's not about coming in there with evidence and saying, look, this is how I did...  BAM!  Wrong!  It's cookie-cutter!  The judge knows they put...  It's a math equation!  It's a math equation!  There's nothing new you can add to this! 
[00:57:30]  And then when it's all said and done, the guy coughs up a lot of his money and gives  it to the woman, because that's the way it's been, and that's the way it's going to be  for years and years and years.  You know, they wanted to...  I actually pushed for something.  They wanted that if she died, I would still have to pay.  Pay who?  Her heirs.  That's where I drew the line.  Ooh, I win!  I had to actually draw a line there and say, no, I will not pay a corpse. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  But they were trying to get that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You never told me that one.  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  They were trying to...  There's fat fuck Dominic Barbara.  And why, then, if she was responsible for your career, should her heirs be penalized if something  were to happen to her?  Can I have another meatball hero? 
[00:58:30]  You fool.  I had to sit through that.  Ugh.  Through that.  Ugh.  Mr. Cuvia, what is your wedding anniversary date?  That was the best ever.  Cue the Jeopardy music.  Can we...  Because I have no fucking clue.  Can we...  Because you bring this up from time to time.  Yeah.  Oh.  Ben, you've got to get the newspaper articles of Vance Divorce.  No offense.  Oh, it's a media frenzy.  No offense, but there is some hilarious stuff in those newspaper articles. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, I know.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, there is...  It's blaring.  I mean, in the New York Post, I think it was...  Yeah.  You were asked what your wedding date was?  Yeah.  Or your anniversary?  It was the guy, and I knew the newspapers were sitting right there in front of me.  I'm on the witness stand.  Big fat Dominic Barber is asking me questions, and I'm just staring at the New York Post and  Daily News guys with their little pads jotting stuff down, going, this can't happen.  This can't happen.  But they ask you your anniversary date. 
[00:59:30]  Mr. Columia, when is your wedding anniversary date?  And I'm just reaching back in my head.  Hmm.  March?  Is it May?  I know Swallows Day in San Juan Capistrano is March 19th.  I remember it was the 19th, but was it the same as Swallows Day or was it May? 
[01:00:00]  I don't know.  What's his answer?  That was my answer.  He was married 10 years.  Good for you, man.  I don't know.  And then that was quoted.  I hate this place.  I've been married 10 years.  I've been married 10 years.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here.  I'm miserable.  I'm drunk all the time.  I have to drink a big glass of Captain Morgan when I come home.  I hate this place. 
[01:00:30]  I get yelled at for being on the computer.  10 years.  10 years.  I've been here 10 years.  She has four fucking cats.  I've got to clean the cat box.  She's a crazy cat lady.  I can't get out of this marriage without going broke.  I hate this place.  Her lawyer's fat.  Get me out of here.  The Daily News and poster in front of me.  I can't testify.  I hate this place.  I've been married 10 years.  I don't remember my wedding anniversary. 
[01:01:00]  I had a threesome.  I'm sorry.  I had a threesome.  I hate this place.  Sorry.  I had a...  Because, well, it was reported.  You know, I just still think that was one of the best things.  I hate this place.  I'm sitting on the couch with my girlfriend.  And she walked...  Wife walked in the door and fell flat on her face.  I hate this place.  That did not happen.  Of course it didn't.  I hate this place.  I had to break into my house to steal my stuff back.  Homeless guys are wearing my t-shirts now. 
[01:01:30]  She gave away all my clothes to the homeless and burnt everything else in the fireplace.  That's what you get.  In the Steve place.  That's what you get.  You lose half your money and she ends up burning all your stuff that maybe you wanted.  Oh, my God.  It's just a living nightmare.  Did she break all the radio awards that we won?  I think I got out with one air award.  Yeah.  The glass one.  Right.  I have that proudly displayed in my house.  We were rocking for like two or three years there.  We were winning everything. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  We have all this hardware that I just throw in the closet.  Whatever.  Oh, now it was, you know.  Oh, and I'd like to present this fucking award to the fireplace.  Yeah.  And the award for scumbag fuck husband goes to Anthony.  Anthony's not here to accept, so a log is going to accept for him.  Holy crap. 
[01:02:30]  Let's throw it in the old Steve.  I'm not even uncomfortable today.  Oh.  Oh, hilarious.  I hate this place.  I've been married 10 years.  I've been married 10 years.  10 years.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's just stacked against men.  And I don't even want to hear it.  I don't want to hear the one instance where the woman got screwed because she was the career woman.  Because that does happen.  But it's so rare.  There is no reason that if two healthy people get a divorce, that they can't just go their separate ways and get a job and live the rest of their life without having to have any contact with each other. 
[01:03:00]  There's no reason the man, especially a guy that's pulling in, you know, maybe $35,000 a year.  All of a sudden, you know, $15,000 or so has to go to the wife?  Why?  Why?  Well, isn't it only for a couple of years?  Just until she gets it back on her feet? 
[01:03:30]  No.  Well, that's the problem.  A lot of women.  No, it's not.  A lot of women are making such a nice income from their divorce settlement that, you know, then they get a, excuse me, another guy, let's say.  But they don't get married because they're making some nice coin on the side.  They live together.  So she's making the nice coin from the divorce settlement.  He's got maybe kind of a job that's bringing in some good money.  Then she gets a little part-time thing on the side.  That's a nice living.  Now, he works his ass off.  So why would you get married just so you would lose your money from the divorce settlement?  A lot of women have done that over the years.  Guy works his ass off.  He's now pulling in $20,000 a year and starving because he's making $35,000. 
[01:04:00]  $15,000 of it, let's say, is going to the wife, who now can also work.  She's healthy.  So she's got her salary plus what the guy gives him.  And, yeah, if she shacks up with another guy, now his income is added to the house.  So who's the biggest loser in this?  The guy who's now working as if he's making $35,000 a year, but he's only pulling in $20,000.  You should be able to stop paying as soon as she stops fucking you. 
[01:04:30]  Like, as long as you can still go over and just go, look, tell the boyfriend, look, you've got to move.  I want to fuck her real quick.  Move it over.  I'm dogging this bitch.  Then you should be able to pay.  But as soon as she starts giving that pussy to somebody else, really, you should be able to stop paying.  As soon as she starts giving up, the only reason, I don't want to talk to her real quick.  There should be a lot of shoulds.  Not a bad idea.  When they start working.  When they start working, there's no goddamn reason in hell the guys should be paying.  Right.  If they're able to work. 
[01:05:00]  But that'll never change.  It'll never, ever change.  Guys will continue to get screwed, and they will continue to get married like fools and idiots.  Yes, marriage has nothing at all to do with love, people.  Nothing.  You could love someone more than you've ever loved anything on the face of the earth and not get married.  Believe it or not, you can do it.  You could live a long life together.  You can write up whatever. 
[01:05:30]  You could go to a lawyer and write up whatever kind of financial contracts you want to write up that will say,  if we break up, I will support this woman and give her everything I have.  Or if we break up, nothing will happen.  Or you could have no paperwork at all and live together.  Marriage is the dumbest thing a guy can do.  You're entering into a legal binding contract that can do nothing but screw you.  Well, after seven years of all living together, right, isn't it going to be a common law in New York?  Oh, there's no common law in New York?  In California, there's a palimony law. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, not in New York?  You've got to be crazy.  But there's no common law in New York.  I thought it was after seven years.  Nope.  Oh, they could take you to court.  Believe me, anyone could sue you for anything.  So if you're living with a girl seven years or longer, you could live with a girl for six months.  She could take you to court and say, he promised to blah, blah, blah for the rest of my life.  Bill Maher's girlfriend.  Yeah, well, that's California, I think.  You know, you could go through all that.  The chances that she's going to win are pretty slim.  Pretty slim.  But with marriage and the legal binding contract you have with a marriage, then you are screwed. 
[01:06:30]  You're definitely screwed.  I don't know why people do it.  And that guy that just called twice, married twice, you couldn't drag me into a marriage with guns to my head.  You could not drag me into another marriage.  It ain't going to happen.  It ain't happening, people.  Half your income, this one's going to cost you.  It's a marriage certificate.  Be dialing. 
[01:07:00]  Dialing for hell, people.  Uh-uh.  Hey, Ben, help us out here.  Someone on the Instant Feedback writes, look at the New York Times today.  There's even times in New York State they won't even grant you a divorce.  I want to read that article.  New York State's a weird state.  You need a reason to get a divorce in New York.  You can't just say irreconcilable differences or I'm not in love with her or I hate the bitch or I hate the guy.  You can't.  You need a reason.  The only reason, and there's only a couple of reasons in New York.  One is adultery. 
[01:07:30]  One is abuse or something.  I'm not sure what they all are.  I wasn't paying attention during my...  When they were telling you?  When they were telling you.  But you can't just get a divorce.  A lot of people, or if you're separated for a year, you could get a divorce.  So a lot of people opt to get separated and then wait a year before they can even start their divorce proceedings,  which take, mine took three years. 
[01:08:00]  Three years.  And I watched people that were multi-millionaires getting divorced quicker than I did.  It was just a nightmare with that fat fuck, Dominic Barbara.  I was so happy when I heard he was getting a divorce.  Is he?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Oh.  Like, I hope your wife just takes everything from you.  Not my food money.  Not my food money.  Robert, what's up? 
[01:08:30]  I, I, three times, my friend.  Three?  You deserve it.  You're stupid.  Yeah, I was.  She, uh, got the house, took my boat, put it on somebody else's property.  I couldn't get it because she allowed it to be there with marital property.  I had to sue him for it.  She ended up getting it in the long run.  Ah, she deserves the boat, right?  You were married.  Yeah.  You get a divorce.  And, yeah, she should get your boat.  Did she ever, did she ever drive the boat when you were married?  Oh, no, she was always too drunk. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, my God.  How does that, how does that make sense with a guy?  That's his little hobby on the side with his boat.  With his friends, they go fishing every once in a while to get out of the house.  And now it's her boat.  And now it's her boat.  Now it's her boat for the guy that she's banging.  It's not just friends.  It was the kids.  Because I got three boys.  And they just teach them how to ski.  It was every weekend we were out there.  And now it'll sit in someone's yard, but it's hers.  All right.  Well, yeah.  She's good for her.  All right.  Thank you.  And I got one other thing.  Oh, I, I, sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  We're probably going to hang up. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe.  Glenn and Philly, what's up?  Yo, I didn't even get married.  We went and had this kid.  And three years, four years, she moves out, takes me to court, tries to keep me away from  the kid.  And I made $10 an hour.  They charged me, because of overtime that I had gotten, they charged me $200 a week.  And they figured in your overtime into what you should be paying her? 
[01:10:00]  Yes.  Man, that great.  Which I eventually lost.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so now he loses the overtime.  So now he's not making the overtime, but he's still paying based on if he had the overtime.  Meanwhile, she's paying in Coke straws two and three at a time.  Isn't that wonderful?  And you wonder why people kill their spouses.  I swear.  Yeah, that's what it is.  And you wonder.  Divorce is always an option.  There it is.  One more.  Jim and PA, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys? 
[01:10:30]  Hey.  Yeah, I'm just about ready to get divorced.  I got it all set up to go through it in January.  Oh, good luck.  You guys are scaring the shit out of me.  No, it's going to start in January, sir.  Yeah.  Oh, I already have all the paperwork going.  I'm just waiting on the holidays because of the kids.  And look the hell out.  You check in another year, and I guarantee you'll still be going through it somehow, someway.  Oh, I'm sure I will, but it's like, jeez, I'm going through stealth mode right now, and  I keep hearing you guys keep talking about it the way it got fucked, and you guys just  scared the crap out of me. 
[01:11:00]  That's it.  All right.  Lacey Peterson's mom.  Thanks, guys.  Check it out.  Lacey Peterson's mom.  Divorce is always an option, not murder.  Murder's not an option, believe me.  But neither is divorce all the time.  It's not.  Okay.  Well, the mother probably wasn't thinking very rationally.  In fairness to the mom, when your pregnant daughter is found, her skull is found floating,  and she's headless with an anchor tied to her, you're not thinking about the legal proceedings  of a divorce and like, you know what?  I understand why Scott murdered my baby girl and her unborn son. 
[01:11:30]  You should think about that a little bit.  Yeah, no, it's obvious the guy was a kook, but...  But then again, Amber Fry was very attractive.  I'm not saying, you know, a good punch to the stomach, maybe, or a trip down the steps.  Oopsie-daisy.  A little foot sticks out in the hallway a little.  Hello, sweetie.  Ker-plunk, ker-plunk.  And with every step she hits, you just see more and more money that you're saving.  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  Sure.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  We're going to take a break.  It's World AIDS Day, Anthony.  World AIDS Day.  What are you supposed to do?  How do we celebrate?  I don't know.  I want to celebrate.  I came up with a first one.  Do we give presents to each other?  Norton, do you got one?  Yes.  Everyone should just put on white socks and a robe and just kind of walk around the streets  like half awake and half asleep.  Oh, my God.  With that, someone on the line, because the listeners are requesting stuff today.  Yes.  We're asking the listeners to request stuff on the show today.  They asked for the Stephen Lynch song, FBA. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, no.  That one?  This is brutal.  Do we have it?  Yes, we have it.  Wow.  This is absolutely brutal.  All right.  Stephen Lynch does not like when we play this song.  No, because it wasn't even written by him.  Who wrote this originally?  Jay Moore?  Jay Moore, with the help of Mike DiNicola.  Jay Moore, Mike DiNicola, wrote FBA.  And handed Stephen Lynch the lyrics, and Stephen sung the song.  Became an underground hit, and especially all the live appearances. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Well, I got the live version, too.  Ooh.  The live version.  You know what?  From where were we?  Asbury?  No.  No, we were in Long Island.  We were at that place on the water.  You know what?  I'm going to do a two, two, twofer.  Ooh.  We'll do the original FBA, and then the sing-along with, like, I think there was 2,000 to 3,000  people singing the song.  Yes.  It's just crazy.  So let's listen to this version first, and then we'll do the live version.  All right.  This is called, what is this called again?  Authors of the Song?  Jay, what's this called? 
[01:13:30]  It's called Full Blown A's.  Down to my target weight.  Sarcoma has popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth in all my friends.  Looks like I'm nearing the end.  No use telling a lie or even a fib when you're lying in bed counting all your ribs.  You try to give blood, but you showed me the door. 
[01:14:00]  Well, I went to stand up, and I fell on the floor.  It's full-blown name.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  Jay and Mike just reading what they wrote in front of me.  So there it is. 
[01:14:30]  And then here's the same song in front of like 2,000 to 3,000 people.  I don't usually do cover songs, but this one's very special to me.  So I brought one of the co-authors of FBA, Mike DiNicolo.  Mike DiNicolo!  Mike has been kind enough to write a little extension to the song.  So if you listen closely, you might hear some things you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight. 
[01:15:00]  Sarcoma popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth in all of my friends.  Looks like this time I'm nearing the end of your long days.  No need to lie, no reason to fear.  When you're flat on your back, counting all your ribs.  I went to give blood, they just showed me the door. 
[01:15:30]  I stood up to leave, and I fell on the floor full-blown name.  Everybody now.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said damn that whore.  Yeah.  Damn that whore.  Let's break it down now.  Mike DiNicolo is going to do a little spoken word.  A little poetry. 
[01:16:00]  Because I know you guys can appreciate some good poetry, right?  Well, the FBA has set in, and he's left feeling a little low.  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good.  So I'm going to go out and share it with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress, here's your tip.  That ain't acne above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave? 
[01:16:30]  Well, that's okay.  I've got time to kill, maybe two or three days.  I'm sitting alone humming this song.  I start to think about everyone who's done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  My fifth grade teacher.  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're going to find a hypodermic in your neck.  Patrons in my restaurant.  What about them?  Their tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that ain't half and half in your stew. 
[01:17:00]  Oh!  And Wendy.  You remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah.  You stood me up for prom.  But I won't infect her.  You won't infect her?  I'm going to infect her mom.  Her mom?  Still blowing AIDS.  Damn that whore!  Damn that whore!  You little fucking whore! 
[01:17:30]  You little motherfucking whore!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  F.B.  It's football AIDS.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony Laboratory.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God, baby.  Hey, guys, anyone want a bagel?  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric.

[01:20:00]  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South.  For sure, man.  It's like the only part of the South you go, like, when I go there, nobody goes, man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you. 
[01:20:30]  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers be hiding in your car and shit.  It's nice here, too hot, bro.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July and shit.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day. 
[01:21:00]  90 degrees and shit.  It's like hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen.  It's everything 24-7 XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:21:30]  Thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.  Absolutely.  Talking about divorce.  Talking about girls tripping. 
[01:22:00]  Talking about talking hot dogs.  Talking about FBA.  What else?  How about the fact that I want to rip my underwear off and throw them out because they're bikini briefs?  You've been kicking at yourself all morning.  And it's only because they're uncomfortable.  These, I hate.  Why are you wearing bikini briefs?  That's all I had left.  It's laundry day or whatever.  Wait, bikini briefs?  Not necessarily.  I don't know if they are or not.  Are they just your standard Fruit of the Loom briefs?  No, no, no.  They're really small.  They're Calvin.  I never wear them. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, my God.  They're not as small as you think.  They're not like that.  They're smaller than I want to think.  Like this?  How big are they?  You might as well just take them down.  Who cares?  Yeah, take them down.  See?  Wait.  They're regular.  They're big.  Those are big.  Okay, well, they're briefs of some sort, but the way they're built, my mule just keeps  popping out the hole, and I hate the way they fit.  Boxer briefs are the way they go.  How do you do your laundry?  I take it down, and there's an expressionless person that runs a place in my building, and 
[01:23:00]  I hand her the stuff.  What?  She just has no facial expression at all.  You know, because of you, I can't even look at Asians anymore when I walk around the streets  of New York.  I laugh every time I walk by one now.  They look like aliens, and they...  Oh, my God.  No, no.  I love Asians, but they have no expression, and they talk like, take me to a liter.  All right?  Same thing.  Take me to a liter.  What is an alien ever said that?  In every movie.  Take me to a liter. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  It happened in the movie, so it's got to be real.  All right?  Yeah.  But that's how you...  But that's how you got to take it out?  Absolutely.  Dude, I don't...  Do they pick it up?  No, it's in my building.  I go right down to the first floor, pick it up, I get it, and I come back the next day,  and the...  End of my block.  Just hand him the laundry, it comes back all folded and nice.  Mine, too.  It's the best.  It's the absolute best.  It's not even that much money, man.  I did it for a long time myself, and I don't even share about the money.  It's such a convenience.  I think it's like $1.50 a pound in my neighborhood. 
[01:24:00]  I don't care.  We had a place in Brooklyn, and no, they lost stuff constantly.  One time, they sent back a load of laundry.  Our whites burnt.  Dude, they burned.  It was in the dryer.  I guess they were drying it in a kiln, and the elastic from my underwear, like, I was  like, why are these, like, burnt?  And I went to put on a pair of the underwear.  The elastic just went...  And, like, snapped right out of it. 
[01:24:30]  Are you sure that was burnt marks, or was that like racing stripes?  Because it was on the T-shirts and everything.  Were you washing Tippy Tom's underwear, and you didn't know it?  No, they burnt it.  And then they lost a whole batch of my button-down shirts and sent me button-down shirts for some  fat guy.  It was like big, giant shirts.  Like, these aren't the shirts.  And then I said, well, why don't you take the ones that...  Go to the guy that these shirts belong to, because perhaps he has my shirts.  Oh, and they couldn't even figure out who it was, where it came from, or anything. 
[01:25:00]  I never got those back.  They would lose socks, pants.  So, uh...  It happens.  After we moved, that was it.  It's annoying.  I'm just saying, as a rule, though, it does save you a lot of trouble.  None of my clothes are that great.  You want to lose one?  Go ahead.  Sex Bagel, you got something?  Hi, Eric.  He must feel pretty confident with what he's about to say.  He walked right in.  He walked in.  You're pretty confident with that.  His chest was pushed forward, his shoulders up, like, oh, I got something to add to the  program.  He even did one of these.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  I'm waiting over here.  Yes.  I thought it was just me, because the area where I'm living right now wasn't...  I mean, Anthony, it was the area...  Yeah, that's the area I moved out of.  Yeah.  That I moved into.  Is where Eric moved into.  So, he's living the nightmare that I was living.  Every time I send laundry out to get done, stuff is missing.  Of course it is.  I'm constantly missing shirts.  It's Brooklyn.  And I go down there.  I'm like, where is this shirt?  Oh, no, no.  Now they can't speak English.  You know?  Now they don't know what I'm talking about.  But they knew how to say, you know, how much it was.  Oh, they know the price. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Well, Anthony, I just thought of something.  Maybe they mixed Martini Steve's clothes in with yours.  Oh, and it just caught on fire.  Everything caught on fire.  You have flame on shirt.  Right.  Oh.  They were trying to put out the fire and the...  Must dry clean all of Steve's stuff or put out fire with the water.  Hey, Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  We're hanging today.  I got an idea.  Instead of bachelor parties, why don't we take the guy to like a scared straight program, 
[01:26:30]  take him over to like a divorce proceedings, take his car, take half his money, then see  if he shows up for the wedding.  Good idea.  Yeah, give him a little preview of what it's like.  Yeah, a divorce court could be like a scared straight program for these young folks that  want to get married, Anthony.  They just...  People never talk enough to people that had miserable marriages and divorces.  You know, I will never get married now.  They step into that marriage thing with a smile and the pictures and the...  Ugh. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I think I'm done.  I had my shot and I think...  I don't think I'm getting married.  Ever.  I remember you talking once.  Yeah.  Dude, I talked when I was 20, 21 about it, too.  But you talked and then like...  I talked and talked and talked and talked about it.  There'd be one day I was like, I don't really think I'm going to do it.  I think I'm going to do it.  And then the very next day, you're like, dude, I will never get married.  You were like that.  It was a day-to-day thing.  Yep.  It's not day-to-day anymore.  Now it's just like, nope, not getting married. 
[01:27:30]  Nope.  Oh, right.  Yes, Ben.  See, that would have been nice.  But that's a whole illusion.  Very romantic places that people go to that perhaps they think about proposing marriage  at these romantic places.  It's an illusion.  That is a true story.  I was in Greece thinking about it.  And where was I?  Top of Santorini.  One of the most beautiful places in the world.  Ah.  And then I was drinking the bottled water because, you know, they told me not to drink  the water.  Yeah.  And I guess the bottled water is bottled. 
[01:28:00]  Bottled there.  With their water somewhere else in the Greek islands.  And yeah, I thought about it for a minute or two.  And then I had explosive diarrhea.  That is a true story.  That'll get your mind off of the marriage thing.  Explosive diarrhea.  In Greece.  You should have asked through the door.  One of the most romantic places in the entire world.  And I have explosive diarrhea. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe that was a sign from God.  I don't know.  Yeah, this is what's going to happen to your bank account.  Right.  Sweetie, I've been thinking, me and you have been together for so long.  And I just, oh, my leg is shaking and I'm sweating.  And I was just thinking, would you be my, oh, I would love to take your hand and, oh, sweetie. 
[01:29:00]  I would stand up right now, but my legs have gone numb because I've been on the toilet for  the last half hour.  Can you hear me okay through the door?  Because I just want to say, you're the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with.  It was the worst ever. 
[01:29:30]  Push the ring under the door.  With your big toe.  I am sliding out under the door.  What are you going to do?  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Still the best scene ever in old school.  That stupid little scene makes me laugh every time.  What scene?  When his whole relationship, you know, finally breaks up for good, Will Ferrell.  And he's in the graveyard for Blue's funeral. 
[01:30:00]  And he confronts his ex there.  And, you know, she pretty much says it's over.  And all he has to say is, good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Keep on trucking, he says, too, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never saw that, but I heard it's a very funny film.  It's, you know, old school was a real funny film, but then it just fell apart at the end.  I don't understand why they can't figure that crap out in Hollywood.  The end of these kind of funny...  Even, you know, I hate to say, because it's probably my favorite movie of all time, but 
[01:30:30]  even Caddyshack, if you really think about it, that whole ending was just completely  ridiculous with everything blown up and stuff.  That movie was so cool.  The whole movie was ridiculous.  But old school with that competition at the end?  Yeah.  That was just so stupid.  They couldn't come up with anything better?  I don't think they know how to end these things.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  They come up with a funny concept for a movie, a lot of great lines, but they really have  trouble wrapping it up.  And it's not just comedies, it's dramas, too.  Oh, my God.  Full Metal Jacket.  Dude, that's not even the ending.  That's the second half of the movie.  No, I understand that, but it's literally two different movies. 
[01:31:00]  There are times I just watch Full Metal Jacket until...  Just the boot camp.  Yeah, just the boot camp.  And then when they go off, that's it.  I throw another movie in.  Yeah.  Your credit should roll.  Right after Hartman gets shot, that should just be the end of the film.  Right.  It should be just a short film.  Although there are some pretty funny lines in the rest of it.  Yeah, but you...  The sickle cell.  But we never quote those.  We never quote the second half of that movie.  We only quote the beginning of it.  Because that stupid Adam Baldwin, you talk the talk, do you walk the walk? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  He's the one that said, thank God for the sickle cell.  I think it was the line.  I vaguely remember that.  Happy birthday, zipper.  That's a great line.  I think one of movie endings that are great, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest might have  the best movie ending.  That was a great movie.  I saw that recently.  I forgot how good that movie was.  It's a word about depressing.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, Jim loves it.  That's why.  Because it's depressing.  But it's still brilliant.  It's a perfect film.  It's brilliant on every level.  No, there are so many.  Happy Hollywood ending there.  Dude, absolutely not. 
[01:32:00]  The guy, you know, come on.  There are so many great characters in that movie.  Unbelievable.  Godfather's got a great ending.  Great ending.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I mean, there's a ton of movies out there that, you know,  are great going through.  They knew how to do it.  Knew how to wrap it up.  There are very few great endings, though.  I know.  But I'm talking about the movies that just fall apart.  And they start off really, really good.  Wait, worse than the movies that fall apart are the ones that you're watching, and all of  a sudden, out of a sudden, out of nowhere, the credits start rolling.  And you go, you ever been watching a movie? 
[01:32:30]  And you're like, what the fuck?  What?  Wait a minute.  You're not done?  You're not done?  What the?  What?  Yeah.  You're not done?  That happened with The Village.  Have you seen The Village yet?  No, I didn't see The Village.  I had very mixed reviews about that.  The whole theater was like, that's bullshit.  What the fuck was that?  They were all just pissed off.  And I was one of those guys.  But then I saw the movie again, and I thought that movie was very cool, actually.  I'll see it.  I'll see it.  I like him.  Very cool.  I mean, because people wanted to see The Village thinking they were seeing a horror film. 
[01:33:00]  And that is the biggest mistake you can make if you rent that movie.  It's not a horror film.  There's scary parts in it, of course.  Really scary parts.  But it's one of these movies where you're sitting there, and all of a sudden, like, the  screen starts going black.  Yeah.  And you go, no.  No, don't even.  You hear the music start.  No.  Come on.  No.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  He was going for a much...  No!  He was going for something very deep in that movie, and I think a lot of people just didn't  get it.  How our society in general is just controlled by fear. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  And that's why I thought the movie was really, really good.  That kind of bugs me that a horror movie is being made into a movie with a message  though.  I don't mind certain movies.  Is that what Michael Moore does?  You know what happens, though?  Yeah, exactly.  You know what happens?  He made the movie, and I think his message was how we're controlled by fear in our society,  okay?  But then stupid Hollywood in the marketing department takes that movie and goes, well,  no, we're going to market this as a horror film.  Oh, okay.  No one's going to go to that.  That's what I think.  Okay.  So then you go to the movie, you see it thinking you're seeing some crazy horror flick, you know? 
[01:34:00]  And next thing you know, the credits roll, and you're like, what the fuck was  that?  Sometimes they disguise chick flicks like an action movie.  They take some action scenes, and they'll make a whole trailer just using the action  scenes, which there are a few of, and it turns out to be a chick flick.  A lot of times, I remember that one, the, which one was that?  The Lieutenant, the fucking...  G.I.  Jane?  No.  Which was good?  No, the English patient.  Officer and gentleman?  No, the English patient.  English patient.  When that first came out, on the trailer, there was the lovey-dovey trailer to get the 
[01:34:30]  chicks in.  And then once I saw a trailer where it showed some, like, battle footage, and you  were thinking, oh, it's going to be a war movie or something.  Yeah, you get tricked.  Total chick flick.  You get tricked into it.  Yeah, Hollywood grabs it and decides, you know, they need a male audience to come to  this, or it's going to tank, so they just make a trailer.  All right, let's...  Haters to those...  Clockwork Orange had a great ending.  Um...  We were in the hospital bed, and I was cured all right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You realized you were ready to go out and rape again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:35:00]  That's a movie I've got to see again.  I haven't seen that in a while.  That's a good one.  Petey, what's up?  Me, Drew.  Yeah, Pete, one of the Drews.  Yo, mama, are you here or what?  Yeah, let's go, Petey.  All right, listen, I've got a very good divorce story that if anybody gets married after hearing  this fucking thing, they better think twice, okay?  Okay.  I married this girl about seven years ago, okay?  Did the whole, went to Yankee Stadium, got the whole wall, want to marry you on the jumbo  truck.  Oh, you're that guy.  Oh, not that guy. 
[01:35:30]  I came here to see the game.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I came to see the game.  Hold on, hold on, let us...  Not your proposal.  You just mentioned something that we really got to talk about for a few minutes here,  and then we'll get back to you.  I hate people like you.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we can bring your attention to the big screen.  Oh, I want to watch the game, not some sap ruin his life.  I'd rather watch an umpire on opening day in Cincinnati keel over and grab his chest. 
[01:36:00]  And see you break out the ring, and they put you on the jumbo.  And she says yes, and they hug, and her box smells, because she woke up early for the  game and didn't shower, hairs on a ponytail and a Yankee hat.  She thinks that Clemens is a first baseman.  Dumb broads.  What, uh...  Oh, that's awful.  What, what's her name?  Uh, uh, her name was Janine.  Janine, and it was Petey and Janine up on the big jumbotron?  Oh, like anyone, but you guys gave a shit.  All right, but let me tell you something, okay?  The Yankees lost that day.  I should have taken that as a hint.  Yeah, well, that's true. 
[01:36:30]  Now, here we have forced forward about seven years, okay?  She's seeing some cop in the neighborhood.  I find out she's running around behind my back while I'm working, seeing some cop, okay?  So, she wants me to move out of the house.  It's my house.  I bought the house.  I'm paying the mortgage.  I ain't going nowhere.  Yeah, you think.  All right?  So, so we're in the middle of a bad thing.  So, you know, one night we hang out.  Now, listen, I wasn't banging no girls either because if I got caught banging a girl, give  her a right to get the house and everything, I wasn't getting caught.  So, one night we're hanging out. 
[01:37:00]  I say, yeah, screw it.  She wants to get with me.  I'm like, all right, let's do it.  So, I end up fucking this girl, all right, my ex-wife.  Next day, the cops are at my house arresting me for rape.  Really?  She said I raped her.  She had demon all over the whole deal.  Oh, my God.  Okay?  So, she raped me, got me a court order.  No, let me tell you.  I'm not done.  I'm not done.  She got a court order, okay?  Hey, what was...  Damn it.  You know, this is a bit we started a couple weeks ago.  What was your wedding song?  Oh, God.  What the hell was the song?  I remember.  Oh, it was that Teddy Pendergrass song. 
[01:37:30]  I bet...  Teddy Pendergrass?  Is he still alive?  Here and now.  That song, Here and Now.  Here and Now.  Here and Now.  I promise you...  That's a terrible, terrible song.  It's perfect for a wedding, though.  It's up to me.  I wish it was Mr. Brownstone or something, okay?  Yeah.  But you know what?  Weddings aren't up to the guys.  What?  Weddings aren't up to the guys.  I think my...  I think, you know, my Uncle Tom just got married, and I think he came out to, like,  a Guns N' Roses song, didn't he? 
[01:38:00]  Do you remember?  He's smart.  You know what's a good song for weddings?  A good song for weddings is Close My Eyes Forever.  Well, this one, I wish you would close your eyes forever.  All right, so you were brought up on rape charges.  She claims she had semen all over her.  Jesus, what the...  Semen all over her, huh?  I got locked up.  They took me to Brooklyn.  They locked me up in Brooklyn.  That's where they arrested me.  Well, thank God not many real hardened criminals get locked up in Brooklyn.  Well, no, you know, the Brooklyn house.  I was thinking I was going to the right because I was shitting a pill. 
[01:38:30]  Did you rape her?  Oh, rapist and right...  No, we had sex.  She came on to me.  It was the whole thing.  It was like, you know, I think I thought things were okay for the night, you know?  So he, you know, took the bait, had sex with her, and then she cries rape.  Wow.  To get the house.  Did she have any marks on her or anything?  No, nothing, nothing.  What'd she say?  Just spray your semen all over my body?  No, no, it was in her, you know?  I shot one up in her.  You know, she got raped.  It was a whole deal.  Wow.  Wait, did you use a condom?  Hell no, man.  You're insane.  You dumped in her? 
[01:39:00]  You hit the divorce?  You dumped in her?  You're insane.  Did you wonder why she said certain things?  Like, look, honey, I just want you to punch me in the face tonight.  What?  Scratch up my tits.  Yeah, this is my fetish.  Punch me really hard as you're having an orgasm.  I was going to do the old hey fuck to her, bang her from behind her, punch her in the back  while I'm fucking her.  Okay?  All right.  That's one of the things I wanted to do.  All right.  So you go to jail for this rape allegation.  I go to jail.  I mean, I'm locked up for a few days.  Like two or three days, they got me locked up so I was able to get out. 
[01:39:30]  All right?  I get out.  Now the bitch got a court order on.  I'm still going to it.  It's not over yet.  I got a court order.  I'm not allowed within 100 feet of my own house.  Of your own house.  Yeah, that's great, isn't it?  And I had one of my friends say, yeah, the bitch is emptying shit out of that house, man.  She's hiding it.  I'm going to get that house back with nothing in it.  Of course.  She's taking all my shit.  What's up?  Of course.  And it's kind of your fault being so stupid.  I was stupid.  Hey, listen.  You got to hardly have been laid in like almost three months at that point. 
[01:40:00]  You got to buy one of those little recorders, dude, and just record all interactions.  They have those little things that are about the size of, like twice the size  of a Pez dispenser.  You know, those little digital recorders.  Put it in your pocket and just record these things.  This way if one of these pigs says you raped her and you didn't, you have it on tape.  And if you did, you can just listen to it and jack off with the memories.  Well, I should have got a hooker.  That's what I should have done instead of banging this fucking girl.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  No problem.  Be good, guys.  Bye, fella.  There goes Petey in the Bronx.  Glennon, Massachusetts. 
[01:40:30]  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Glennon.  Hey.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Angel Eyes.  Hey, you know, this support thing is pretty good if you're on a receiving end.  Well, you're one of the lucky guys.  There's not many of you out there.  Well, my girlfriend is still married.  She left two years ago.  And this guy is one of these crybaby, baby comebacks, sniveling whiners.  And he has to work an extra day.  He has to work on Saturday so he has enough money to pay her. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, I get it.  You're the boyfriend.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you're the boyfriend that got divorced from her husband.  She drives a brand new car, makes the payment with his money, and he drives an old pickup truck with a different colored tailgate on it.  He's bought in a junkyard.  He's looking for the new tailgate.  This guy's banging.  And does she, like, treat you to things?  Well, yeah.  With his money?  She has a brand new car that he's paying for and never even got to ride in it yet.  Do you drive it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We use it all the time. 
[01:41:30]  I have to kill her.  Well, I have to slit her throat.  That guy should be able to pull up, get in his brand new car, have her suck his hog, and then get back into his jalopy and go home.  Well, Ant bought a new house recently.  Yeah.  I feel...  Yeah.  I bought a house in Huntington.  Ant bought a new house in Huntington that he's never going to see.  I've never seen it.  Really?  Is that something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel real bad for this guy.  I'm paying for it.  Every time I wipe my cum off her back with my T-shirt, I feel bad for this guy.  But, you know, that's the way it is. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Thank you, Glenn.  Bye, Glenn.  Glenn likes to rub it in.  You know, I hate the people that get engaged at sporting events and at the New York City Marathon.  It's those things that they think are so cool.  Dude, I'm an Islander.  I'm an Islander ticket holder.  I can't think of anything more white trash than asking someone to marry you at an Islander game.  That's nothing more white trash than going to an Islander game.  I know.  And it's usually they're in the nosebleed seats.  It's like, dude, look, all right, maybe you're not making a lot of money. 
[01:42:30]  I understand.  Whatever.  But if you're going to ask your chick to marry you at the Islander game, you don't want the jumbotron and the camera guy going to the last row so you can do it.  Why don't you suck it up and get better tickets at least?  I like how the announcers on TV have to go, and I hope the marriage fares better than the Islanders are tonight.  And then you see the guy on the ice punching the other guy, and you go, well, let's hope the marriage goes that way.  She gets mouthy, just grabs her by the shirt and punches her until somebody grabs him off. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  We've got to move on a little bit.  We've got my fies to give away.  Oh, yes, we do.  We love the my fies.  We came up with some clever ideas on ways to give these away.  It's becoming one of the hottest Christmas items this season.  Newsday wrote a little thing on the MyFi, a new way to beam tunes.  The Delphi XM MyFi, billed as the world's first XM portable, allows users to listen to XM satellite radio broadcast live.  The device, which will be available this month, can record up to five hours of XM programming. 
[01:43:30]  Then you can listen to the stations when you want to.  The radio can hold 128 megabytes of memory or about 100 songs.  There you go.  And we've got...  Good for a plane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just download your favorite stations or this show, what have you, and then you listen on the plane ride or whatever.  And they delete it when you get off.  It's just amazing.  And listen live.  You can listen live.  You dock it into your computer.  You download what you want to listen to.  Oh, you can download certain...  And then it has like a fast-forward, rewind feature. 
[01:44:00]  It's just amazing.  Very cool.  Say you're rejected from the plane and your shoes are off and you're sitting, shaking on the side of the runway.  You could listen to something.  Wow.  If you had it with you.  I don't understand why Elton John's doing the commercials, but that was someone's decision.  Because he's like Mr. Popularity?  Music guy?  I don't know.  Music is popular?  I would have got someone a little hipper.  Yeah.  Than Elton John?  You find somebody.  He's looking like Charles Nelson Reilly these days, isn't he?  Oh.  What the hell happened to Elton John? 
[01:44:30]  Goodbye, yellow brick howl.  Yeah, he's wearing like an ascot in it or something.  I don't really care.  A kerchief around his neck.  I truly don't really care that he's gay, but he's...  He's what?  But he's becoming like an old queen now.  I mean, I don't know what's going on with him.  At least he's got a better wig than he used to have.  I don't know.  Sir Elton John, Opie.  Oh, man.  Sir Elton John.  I wish I saw this earlier.  You know that guy from the Bronx?  Yeah.  With the rape allegations, and he was pretty stupid, obviously. 
[01:45:00]  Tony writes, this guy's wedding song should have been What a Fool Believes.  Oh.  Here and Now is just an awful song.  Here and Now.  Light FM, awful song.  So we have my fives to give away.  We'll get back to that in a second.  But first, John in Philly.  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Good.  Hey, John.  So check it out.  I'm at a Phillies game.  This year, we got a small season ticket planned for the Phillies with the new stadium.  And we're at the game.  And every time somebody proposes to some broad in the crowd, we start yelling. 
[01:45:30]  The whole group of us start yelling, don't do it.  You're throwing your life away.  Oh, that's perfect.  This one time, this one time it happened, we look behind us, and they're sitting in  the row behind us.  Oh.  And we're on the big screen in the new stadium, yelling no, and she stormed out crying her  head off, because we ruined the whole thing for her.  You wrecked it.  You wrecked her special moment.  Why would, by the way, let me interrupt you, dude.  Why would anyone ask their wife to marry him at a Philly sporting event?  Sporting event.  Sportings?  Yeah, well, yeah, you know what I mean. 
[01:46:00]  Sportings?  Sportings event.  Could you find a more vile place?  Well, I went to the screening of the accused, and I flashed a little message across the  screen.  Schindler's lips.  Oh, my God.  What I was going to say, it is Philly.  As she was walking out, did you guys pelt her with snowballs?  I was doing everything we could.  Philly sporting event.  Cheese, steak, whatever there was.  Yeah.  Did the Philly fanatic come over and make like he was banging her?  Remember how bad he smelled when he came in the studio with Philly, that reeking costume?  It was awful.  Never clean that goddamn thing. 
[01:46:30]  Filthy suit.  I hate mascots.  Opie, were you on the New York Islander kiss cam?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah, but that wasn't my choice.  No, of course not.  You were ambushed.  You were on the kiss cam?  Yeah, I was on the kiss cam.  Is that where somebody beats you and kicks you down the stairs?  You can only dream.  It's worse.  Hug you and makes you feel better?  They play, what's that guy's song?  I just want your kiss.  Tom Jones version?  Yeah, whatever. 
[01:47:00]  And then, yeah, they have couples.  And then it gets cute at the end of the kiss cam segment.  They show two hockey players from the opposing team.  And they put a heart around them.  A big heart around them.  Let's see if they're going to kiss.  Yeah, it was on that thing.  And the jumbotron falls to the ice, killing an entire team.  Well, it almost did.  Yeah, I know.  Almost did.  All right, one more divorce thing.  We've got to move on.  Tony in Milford, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, man?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Listen, my wife got killed like two days before Thanksgiving. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, listen, it's been so fucking, she's getting $1,500 a month, right?  And I was paying her to the ball.  So I says, all right, man, no problem.  You know, this bad.  I had to pay what I had to pay.  Next thing I know, man, I get a phone call.  And they're like, oh, your wife was involved in a car accident.  I was like, yeah.  Oh.  She passed away, man.  I was like, oh, Jesus.  I went to the funeral, and she still had $7,000 she took from my bank account. 
[01:48:00]  I was like, holy shit, man.  The money was still there.  I got the money back.  Really?  So, yeah.  And I told the mother one.  She's like, oh, we need money.  And I was like, hey, yeah, okay, no problem.  I'll call you.  Did you call her?  My God.  I don't.  It was like you got a raise.  Yeah.  That's awful.  All right.  Well, thank you, Tony.  We're done with that for now.  I'm not talking about that today.  Thank you.  I hope you would.  All right.  So we have my fives to give away, Anthony.  Yeah.  One a week up through Christmas, I guess, right? 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  And we're asking, what would you do for my fi?  We got a few more that came in today.  They're not as good as yesterday's.  But I can read it.  We'll be the judge of that.  Yeah?  All right.  Alex writes, from Missouri, I guess.  What's M.O.?  Missouri?  Missouri.  Okay, good.  One, I fall into the eating something really nasty group for the my fi.  I would happily suck down a dozen night crawlers for a my fi and maybe wash it down with a  couple of live goldfish.  What is this, the 1950s? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  In a fur coat.  And then we'll try to see how many people he could squeeze into a phone booth.  Or maybe you could just dance and see how many hours you can go for consecutively dancing.  Oh, a marathon.  But he's dedicated to the wow.  I guess he's a trucker.  And every trailer he picks up, he adds the wow on the back for us.  So thank you very much.  It is Whip Him Out Wednesday today, by the way.  I remember, by the way, we had asked someone at XM to get those banners for trucks.  Remember those things we talked about getting some XM?  Well, we talk about getting a lot of things.  No, but O.B. and Anthony banners.  The truckers, we'll put them on.  Yeah.  On the back of the rigs.  Free advertising. 
[01:49:30]  And we said, I think someone said that they were going to do that.  I'm just wondering.  That probably must be on the way, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They'll get back to us on that as well.  Oh, good, good, good.  Circle around.  Yeah, let's circle rack that.  Circle rack.  Circle rack.  Let's see.  Matt writes, for the MiFi, he wants to go through the fart gauntlet.  I would sit in studio and allow Jim Norton to fart in my mouth or wherever else he wants  all day long.  Since this would be pre-planned, I'm sure Jimmy would load up on plenty of cheesecake and  egg salad from questionable bodegas and stuff like that. 
[01:50:00]  Here's the problem with that.  But I wouldn't mind it, but A, poor open ant would have to suffer through my...  Yeah.  And also, I can't put my ass on a guy's mouth and fart.  I would feel too...  It's too close.  Yeah, that's...  I don't put my ass on a guy's face trying to reason.  That's pretty bad.  All right, so...  I'll fart on your cock.  So that's a no?  Hey, Ben, do you have an address at Foundry Music?  I've been wondering that.  No.  Oh, okay.  By the way, if you guys are sending stuff into the show, especially like sound stuff, send 
[01:50:30]  it right to steve at foundrymusic.com, that would be a big help.  Right.  All right?  Because my email, for some reason, if I forward this stuff to Steve, the files, it's just a  mess.  I can't attach files, and so that's why I write you guys back and say just send it to Steve.  For my file, this is Jeff, I will take a vomit enema.  Whoa, that's creative.  I will eat something, vomit in an enema bag, then douche my a-hole out with my own vomit.  It is called a vomit enema. 
[01:51:00]  Ah, clever name.  That'll be a lovely...  I'm impressed with that.  Anybody who will lay under that while he evacuates, they deserve a my fight.  One up the guy.  Yeah.  All right, I'm going to put it in the...  We'll think about it folder.  How's that?  That's a pretty good one.  Okay.  Wow, this guy already wrote back, I guess.  Okay, apparently my idea of eating the worms and goldfish sucked ass.  Wow.  He already knew it sucked ass, because I got this email before we said it sucked ass. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, what happened there?  Was he listening to the replay before we were done with the show?  Did he just go back to the future on us?  That's what happens when you fast forward on the new MyFive.  Maybe as a MyFive, he fast forward, heard what we were going to say, and then wrote.  That's pretty bizarre.  It has been done way too much, he writes, and that's what we said, too.  What the...  I have no idea, man.  All right, I'll be more than happy to wear Tippy Tom's underwear on my head with the shit  stain over my face for one hour during the show.  He will not last an hour. 
[01:52:00]  No one would last an hour.  No one.  That deserves a MyFive.  That's rough.  That deserves...  And you have to keep a heart on while you do it.  You could tape my mouth shut so I would have to smell all that fudgy goodness while  I sit quietly on the lesbian couch.  Even though I live in Missouri, driving myself to New York City would be no problem at all.  God damn it.  That's a good one.  If that idea is already taken...  The shorty state.  He goes, if that idea is already taken, I could walk my 6'3", 400-pound ass around in 
[01:52:30]  front of the building wearing lingerie, holding a sign saying whatever you want, but that  may add too much gay to the show.  But that may add too much gay to the show.  Sorry.  Yes or no?  He sounds like he...  All right.  I like him.  He likes to win.  You like him?  It's all right.  And Tippy Tom's underwear.  All right.  That's a rough one.  We got John on the line.  He says he'll listen to Imas for one hour for MyFive.  Yeah.  We'll get into the Imas story in a few minutes here. 
[01:53:00]  God damn nanny.  And this guy writes, uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  What's he writing, Opie?  Opie!  He wrote, uh...  No, there's nothing here.  He does say he wants to be involved in the cherry darts thing, so we can segue into that,  I guess.  All right.  That we'd like to do.  That's more a game of skill.  We're doing cherry darts Friday.  And we will give away a MyFive to the winner this Friday.  That's how we decided to give away the first one. 
[01:53:30]  And I think next week we might go with the guy with the Voss thing, right?  The Voss...  Uh...  Yes.  Ear thing and the, uh...  What else did he want to do?  This...  Oh, and, uh...  The snot.  Yeah.  The snot cracker or whatever.  Let's not.  Okay.  So, this Friday we're going to do cherry darts, Ant.  You want to explain that?  Well, we got a lovely young lady.  And do we have a lovely young lady?  Steve's taking care of that.  And so far...  Uh...  Steve's record is pretty...  Steve's definition of lovely is a lot different than our definition of lovely.  Maybe we need Steve to come in here and explain the lovely lady that he has, uh, booked for 
[01:54:00]  Friday's show.  Steve, how lovely is this lady that's going to do the cherry darts?  Most of the time, your choices are just abominable.  It's been once.  My team needs Steve.  She's lovely.  Um, I got on the phone with a gentleman last night with an adult video company and, and,  and, uh, and specified that we needed a good-looking woman. 
[01:54:30]  So, this is, this is actually somebody from the West Coast.  Oh.  This is actually someone, and the West Coast girls are generally...  West Coast of Jersey?  We have a West Coast girl coming in.  We can't even get these horse to come in from, from, from South Brunswick.  This is a girl who's in town shooting, and she's also doing a period, she's doing a...  So, she's pretty hot?  Yeah.  She's not from the crack whore, uh, confet, uh, crack whore confession website, is she?  Oh, God, I hope not.  What's her name?  You don't want to say.  Uh, her name is Star, I believe.  Ah.  That's not her real name.  Sure it is.  Gee, Jim, you think?  Well, he was goofing and... 
[01:55:00]  No, I'm sorry.  I, I apologize.  I'm gonna go ahead.  Oh, is Tom getting all choked up?  Yeah, Tom's crying on the Today Show.  So, Tom Broker doing a little, uh, champagne, and then he's getting a little choked up.  Oh, he's getting a little choked up here.  I think I'm gonna start crying.  They're just trying to make him cry.  Oh, look at his tear.  Oh, he's got a tear.  He's thanking his staff, and they fade to black.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly.  No.  Someone get me a clint, a clint, a clint, a tissue. 
[01:55:30]  So, hot chick, Steve?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Nothing like the girls that were, uh, at the Hammerstein, right?  No.  No, I've been assured that she has nothing like those two.  I like those girls.  They were, I'm not saying that they were the perfect, but they were the least.  The definition of a hot chick isn't a skank in one of your shirts.  Wow.  Um.  See?  Hot.  Fire hot.  Ah!  No one gets the fire hot thing anymore. 
[01:56:00]  No, it's just, it takes a while.  Yeah.  You're just too brilliant for us, Anthony.  Hey, look, it's the Elton John commercial.  See, that's...  I like that.  He has a black maid behind him.  That's good.  It's not racist.  British.  Here's the commercial for the MiFi.  Them hanging in a limo with, uh...  A bunch of chicks.  Why?  Why?  Why?  We should have some young man...  Exactly.  ...hobbing his knob as he listens to a MiFi.  ...with what looks like a port wine stain, but, you know, is just there because he's,  well, not feeling too well lately. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, my God.  What?  That was Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I'm keeping my job.  I'm keeping my job this time.  It's all about me.  Mate.  All right.  So, um...  So, um...  So, we got a lovely young lady.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  All right.  Yeah.  So, looks like, uh...  She's secured.  Looks like she's got a, you know...  What does she look like?  Blonde.  Very buxom.  Uh, tan.  You know, typical West Coast chick, like, you know, generally the West...  Typical West Coast stripper.  Yeah.  Typical West Coast stripper.  Generally, the West Coast girls are substantially better looking than anything on this coast. 
[01:57:00]  Big fake titties?  Yeah, because that's where the porn industry is.  And when they come out here to do dance appearances or, um...  Or, uh...  Or, you know, video shoots.  You know, you try to recruit them for as much as you can.  Did you explain to her what Cherry Darts is?  Yes.  I explained it in detail.  Game for the fun.  All right.  We love Cherry Darts.  The guy who set it up knows exactly what it is and explained in detail what it is.  They're going to throw cherries into your asshole.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We get a lovely young lady.  She gets down on her knees and bends over, you know, kind of puts her head to the ground 
[01:57:30]  in doggy-style position.  And, uh, we get some contestants with maraschino cherries, and then they dip it in a little  bit of whipped cream.  Dip, dip, dip.  And then, uh, standing, uh, how many feet behind did we, uh...  Well, we don't have much room in here, so I guess from the window to the lesbian couch  would work.  That's pretty far.  Maybe 15 feet.  15 feet or so.  You must lob the cherry, shoot it in any way you damn well please, and the closest to  the bunghole, the closest to the balloon knot. 
[01:58:00]  I believe I did the bullseye last time.  Oh, yeah.  Stuck right in.  We should do it with cherry bombs.  Straight with that being.  Just blow our ass apart, right?  If Steve had his way, it would be with firecrackers or something.  Oh, that's not true at all.  For M80s, that's not accurate.  It really is.  Chainsaw darts.  I'm happy.  Oh, he's fast-forwards in Raging Bull to the scene where he's beating her in the bathroom,  just waxes back.  Wonderful.  So mischaracterized. 
[01:58:30]  Really is.  Yeah.  All right, so, uh, we're gonna do this Friday for a MyFi.  Mm-hmm.  The problem is...  Now, how are we gonna pick contestants?  That is the biggest problem.  Because now, we got people that are writing in that want to do some stuff for a MyFi.  You gotta be pretty good.  It's pretty rough to, uh, get past our, uh, you know...  Here's the other problem.  Our, our, our rigid standards that we have for people doing activities here in the studio.  It's gotta be good.  Right.  Something like cherry darts, I'm not saying it's easy, but it's a lot easier to be part 
[01:59:00]  of that than it is to have to do a vomit enema or eat Voss's snot.  Right.  So, we gotta pick people out.  Now, how are we gonna pick them?  I don't know.  I really don't know how to do this one.  Because then, um, the listeners from all over the country, they're getting pissed off  that we're doing something that is more of a local thing.  Sorry, move to New York.  What can we say?  Yeah, you can come in and be a part of it.  You know, I have an idea.  Yeah, I mean, it could get a little crazy, but, I don't know, you show up, you get to  throw a dart. 
[01:59:30]  How many people could possibly show up on Friday?  I don't know.  You show up, you can throw a dart, and then...  Yeah, you might have to wait outside, because we don't have a lot of room in here if there's  a lot of people, and we bring up people.  What if we have a tie?  Tie, then there'll be a shoot-off.  A throw-off, yeah.  A throw-off.  A throw-off.  We'll be the judges, you, me, and Jimmy.  Mm-hmm.  Our words are final.  I was thinking of, like, having people come down and then have a lottery, but then the  people that came down here, you know, they just wasted their time to get here, so I'm 
[02:00:00]  thinking if you show up between certain hours, then you get to throw a dart at the porn star.  That's fair.  That's a lot of people, though.  And what are we going to do?  Measure each hit from the bunghole out to where it impacted?  Yeah, we'll figure all that out.  We just got to figure out how to get the contestants.  What do you think?  You get to throw.  I don't think...  How many people could possibly show up, seriously?  I don't know.  It's two-day notice.  When I was talking to you last night online and I put that notice up, Ben and I, between 
[02:00:30]  that time and 4 o'clock this morning, hundreds, hundreds of emails.  Good.  So we'll throw a little party on the street.  They'll enjoy it in the building, I'm sure.  Why not?  We've had no problems here.  Parade of people.  Nah, well...  Hey, fire up the Yeager machine.  No?  No?  Nothing?  What?  We're not talking about that.  I'm sure maybe the people that come up would want to knock a few back.  Ex-nay on the... 
[02:01:00]  Jägermeister, eh?  I hear you.  Jägermeister machine, bad.  Bad, bad.  Bad.  We love Jägermeister, but machine, bad.  It was chased out of here with torches and pitchforks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you guys think?  Sure.  We can control it.  Everyone come down.  How about if there's more than X amount, we can't do it.  If there's more than 50, you just got to set a limit.  You can't have, you know, 2,000...  We're not going to get 50 people.  All right, well then, okay, then you set the limit. 
[02:01:30]  Two-day notice, I don't think we're getting 50 people.  You guys think, Ben?  As executive producer of the show, yeah?  I think we can get 50.  Yeah.  I think we should talk about this off the air.  No, we do everything on the air.  That's right.  We should have a meeting.  We should have a conference call.  Let's involve D.C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think?  That's cool that we can have the cherry thing, maybe in, I don't know, maybe when I get some  improv skills, we could have the cherry throwing contest.  Pick any month.  I could have picked any month, but I didn't want to pick December because we're in it. 
[02:02:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  So how many...  We could go first 20 people?  20?  25.  What?  What if they just email us, if they can make it?  That way we can contact them, we can give them the direct, you know.  Stop it, Jim.  Yeah, but you're going to get a lot of email.  A lot of email, Ben.  Ben, what are you going to do?  It's okay.  So we have 50 people here.  You know how long that's going to take?  A few minutes.  How long, Ben?  It's going to take to throw a dart into an asshole.  It's, you know, throw, move. 
[02:02:30]  Do it all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's easy.  They get one dart.  Exactly.  Wind up and throw it as hard as you want.  Hmm.  No do-overs.  What do you think?  I like it.  25.  First 25?  30.  For some reason, I'm thinking 30.  First 30?  30.  50.  50, you think?  I say 50.  Really?  How long will it take?  50 people.  If it takes a minute a person, that's still less than an hour. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it won't.  It won't.  Come on.  You know better than that.  No, 50 people's not bad.  You bring 10 up at a time, they throw their stupid darts.  There you go.  Tell the other ones to go down and do some piano shopping.  Right.  Hang out in the Steinway place.  Do we have, like, gifts to give these guys for coming up?  How about porn?  We have stuff.  Like shirts and stuff?  Yeah, we have stuff.  All right.  Why don't we do that?  We'll take a break.  We'll figure it out.  All right.  But I think we should just have the first 50 people outside where we broadcast.  They come up, have a little fun, throw their dart. 
[02:03:30]  I like it.  And the winner walks away with a MiFi.  Why not?  Sounds good.  I was going to be psyched.  What else are we going to do Friday?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to play something in a break because I've got to do something.  What do you've got to do, Ope?  I've got to dump.  Don't use stall, too.  The Tippy Tom Memorial stall there.  By the way, are you still opening the windows?  Yes, because it's small.  It's fucking eight degrees in there.  There's no reason to open the windows, you germaphobe. 
[02:04:00]  Ben.  I'm not a germaphobe.  You are.  It's a bathroom.  It's not supposed to be pleasant.  All right.  You know what?  We'll play it.  Go in, do your business, get out, not open windows and hang curtains.  Oh, my.  Every time I walk in there, it's freezing.  I know.  But you just go in there, you take a whiz, and you walk out.  You don't hang out in the bathroom.  Suck it up.  By the way, we're still taking suggestions for what you would do for my five, but the first  one will be the Cherry Dark, you know, competition, okay?  Yes.  What's going on with Police Got My Car?  We got another version of that yet? 
[02:04:30]  It's coming.  All right.  We'll do another Brother Joe holiday classic, Anthony.  What's happening with it?  Which one's this?  This was off our Dementor World CD.  Which one is that?  People will chuckle.  It's the grandma song.  Oh, you might think it's the actual stupid grandma song, but, you know, listen, it's  not.  It's not.  Some people get confused.  Granny got run over by a reindeer.  Tell us every year, you friggin' nerd.  Glad to hear about your drunken granny. 
[02:05:00]  That tanked-up bitch got just what she deserved.  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas.  With the dick that wrote this song.  Granny drank whiskey with Quaaludes.  While toking sense to me and from a bong.  I tried to greet his evil granny.  But she kicked me in the nuts. 
[02:05:30]  She was sucking on a crack pipe.  Yelling, piss off, die, you bastard scumbag butts.  Granny got run over by a reindeer.  And every time I hear that song, I twitch.  Don't feel bad about that psycho granny.  Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch.  There was dinner on the table. 
[02:06:00]  Hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop.  Granny's crawling underneath.  Hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop.  Didn't know what she was up to.  Till I saw that big old smile on Uncle Pete.  Granny left to score some Valium.  And took off running down the path.  That's when old St. Nicky creamed her.  Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass. 
[02:06:30]  Granny got run over by a reindeer.  Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve.  Good riddance to that evil demon, Granny.  As for me and Grandpa, we're relieved.  Granny was a ho, ho, ho.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons. 
[02:07:00]  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance,  and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I live in New York City.  I moved up there after I got, after I quit drinking.  And New York City.  I moved there from Texas, by the way. 
[02:07:30]  Get this, man.  I left in Houston, Texas.  My apartment, 1,400 square feet.  Balcony, 30 floors up.  Air conditioner, centralized.  Dishwasher, washer, dryer.  Free parking.  Drum roll.  $400 a month.  What a fucking idiot, huh?  I feel like a real moron.  I moved to an apartment.  I can touch one wall with that hand.  The other wall with that foot. 
[02:08:00]  $1,000 a month.  It's super moron.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I can answer the door.  Answer the phone.  Take a leak.  Be in the shower.  All at once.  For I am super fucking moron.  Unbelievable.  All my friends call me up all the time.  Hey, living in New York.  You been mugged yet?  Yeah, as a matter of fact, the first of every month.  They got it systemized. 
[02:08:30]  Apparently, it's legal.  Little whizzing guy.  Give me all your money.  Yes, sir.  It's not an apartment.  It's a compartment.  I should have read the fucking ad better.  This thing has a Murphy tub.  You know, the sad thing is I tell people who live in New York about my apartment.  They all, to a man, they go, you got a great deal.  Where the fuck do you live?  I live in your Murphy tub.  $1,200 a month. 
[02:09:00]  I thought that was a roach.  No, it's me.  Quit spraying me.  Jeez, I'm sorry.  That's not very good, you know, apartment relations.  Spraying raid on your neighbor.  Even disabled people are cocky today.  You notice this?  I'm on a plane in Cleveland.  This lady gets on.  She's got crutches.  She comes down the aisle.  She gets to me.  She throws the crutches right in my face.  She goes, put those up there. 
[02:09:30]  She didn't ask me nicely.  Ten years ago, she wouldn't have been that arrogant.  Ten years ago, I wouldn't have punched her in the face, you know?  But I feel we're equal, so.  Some of you's laughing.  The rest of you, I can hear your ass cheeks puckering up on some of this stuff.  Oh, that was controversial.  Boy, the truth hurts when it's stuck in my ass.  Is that the truth in my ass, Bill?  What is that squeaking noise?  It's the truth, Jim. 
[02:10:00]  Just enjoy it.  It feels kind of good.  It's the truth.  Enjoy it.  Does anybody speak English in Los Angeles anymore?  Is there anybody from that country?  I'm at the bank the other day, and lying.  The guy in front of me is sitting on a donkey.  He's got a towel wrapped on his head.  He's trying to cash a check with a picture of a dictator stabbing his father in the ass  with a pitchfork on the check.  Oh, yeah, that'll clear.  The guy in front of me is sitting there, and he looks over, and he pins it, you know. 
[02:10:30]  Stewardess, can I see you for a moment?  Yes, sir.  Gun?  No.  Uh, anyway, uh, can you give me a pencil and paper, please? 
[02:11:00]  Yes, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Dear sir, I'm seated across the aisle from you, and your fly is open, you're completely  exposed.  And I knew this note would avoid any embarrassment.  Yours truly, Frank Martin.  Yes, I love you.  Dopey, right?  On the O.P. and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping 
[02:11:30]  candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  Give me feel, give me fire, give me double time and stop.  What would you do for a MiFi?  On the O.N.A. Show Friday, it's cherry darts for a MiFi.  Fire.  We're going to work out the details after the show today, but we're thinking, you know,  first 50 people who show up, we bring you upstairs, you throw a dart at the porn star, 
[02:12:00]  and the one that's closest to the old blue knot will win the MiFi.  The old bunger.  The old blue knot.  The old stink hole.  The old blue knot, which is right next to the whale's eye.  Yes, it is.  Jason, the trucker.  What's up, Jason?  Make it fast.  Hey, I hope I don't crash in Steve, but let's call it.  The other week I got wowed by some truck drivers there with a girlfriend, Cool Water.  Full nudity, standing up in a fresh shaker condo. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, that wow thing works.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday, and you can get your wow stickers through opianthony.com.  Hey, one more thing.  I was at a truck stop.  Every truck stop I go to lately, Cheers is all over the place.  I was hoping to get like maybe 100 miles stickers and fucking stick them up all over the place.  All right, send us an email immediately.  We'll have them out to you in June.  Yeah.  I can.  I'm in a truck.  I know.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Yeah, we'd love to give him some stickers so he can spread the virus out there.  And those things that the truckers, when I hang on the back of the truck, I found out in break, are being made. 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  Oh, they are?  I have no idea.  I just wanted to finally sell it something we haven't done promotionally.  Hey, Ted, what's up?  Hey, man, I got an idea for your contest on Friday.  Okay.  The folks that aren't in New York, how about you just have the first 50 callers and match them up with the 50 people that come in so we have a chance at it, man.  It's not a bad idea, actually.  Match them up.  But then again, the people who are throwing are going to be pissed off that they're not going to.  If I'm coming in to throw a dart into an anus, I don't want to be the one who's matched up with some guy who.  Well, why doesn't XM just throw us a bone?  I mean, it's great to give us some my-fives to give away, but one a week. 
[02:13:30]  Why don't you give us a couple a week?  That'd be good.  We'll have one to give away to the people that throw the darts live, and then maybe we'll do a side contest where Anthony and I and a bunch of people that represent the show here will represent for people all over the country.  Yeah.  And play for people all over the country.  I like that.  Let's bring that up in a meeting.  All right.  Thanks, Ted.  We've got to figure all this out after the show, all right?  Yeah, man.  All right.  Thank you.  But the guy's thinking.  I like that.  Yeah, the same guy saying the same thing.  And we've got to get Larry the Cable Guy in here. 
[02:14:00]  One more call.  Casey from Harlem, what's up?  What's up, man?  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Can we come in and drink on Friday?  Can you what?  Can we come in and drink?  Come in and drink?  On Friday?  Yeah.  No, we have no alcohol here to be served, sir.  Sorry.  What you do before you get here is your own business.  We do not have a liquor license.  We do not serve alcohol on the Opie and Anthony show.  What have we brought in?  What's that?  I was going to come in and be married.  Oh, wow. 
[02:14:30]  No, we don't have a liquor license.  Thanks anyway, pal.  Can't come in with booze.  No booze.  I kind of like this guy's idea, though.  He's terrific.  Are you a bartender?  No, I'm just a drunk.  All right.  Thank you.  I think it's going to be a party on Friday.  No booze.  Dude, we didn't even tell anyone that Larry the Cable Guy was here.  Yeah, I know.  How could you guys not promote that?  He's doing arenas.  I think he's the biggest star we've had on XM Satellite Radio since getting here.  There he is.  You are the biggest star we've had on XM Satellite Radio thus far.  Good Lord.  You, Larry the Cable Guy. 
[02:15:00]  Y'all hurt.  If I'm the biggest star you ever had on here, there's something wrong.  Good Lord.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, you're dying.  You didn't call us yesterday from a truck, did you?  No, I don't think I did.  It's the same voice we heard yesterday.  It sounded like it.  I got a truck, but I don't think I called you finally.  Larry, we got to tell you, we're new to talking to the whole country.  We were syndicated on regular radio on the East Coast.  Basically, we were syndicated to the blue states, okay?  And now we're syndicated to the entire country. 
[02:15:30]  And we're trying to get used to the southern voice and the truckers and all that.  Yeah, you know what?  It's kind of foreign to us.  It takes a while to get used to it.  You know, I got a buddy of mine that don't even move his lips when he talks.  And you're always like, hey, you want to go up to the store?  He's like, no, I don't care.  I'm like, what the hell?  My dad heard that.  He was laughing.  I'd done that joke one time.  My dad thinks I'd stare.  He'd come up to me.  He's like, hey, daddy, daddy.  Jimmy Norton, good to see you.  Thank you.  Good Lord, he's a funny. 
[02:16:00]  You got screwed on that damn.  What, the last comic stand?  The last comic stand, and we were watching that.  They were okay.  You know what?  I had an MTV contract, and I kind of, I signed already.  So NBC was cool.  We kind of knew that was happening.  Well, I always thought it should have been, because it, you know, that's so political.  That shit, because I'm watching.  I'm like, oh, okay, well, they got the black guy.  They got the white guy.  They got the oriental guy.  They got the, you know, that should have been.  They should have changed the name to Last Demographic Stand, and that's what they should have changed it to.  So, you know, if you're a white guy on there, you ain't got a chance. 
[02:16:30]  No, you're right.  And I don't think I would have went very far.  I probably would have got booted the first or second round.  Thank God you didn't have a retard on there.  You know you'd have been beat.  Oh, yeah.  The way I did, his name is Rich Voss.  Yeah.  I'll make you money.  He's funny.  I'll make him a fool.  He's funny.  I can't get used to the accent ever, man.  Yeah, we got a lot of truckers that call up now.  A lot of truckers, and they love to talk.  Boy, I'll tell you what.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  They got them satellite radios, too.  They sure do.  That's why we're trying to be really nice to the truckers. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, truckers are good folks.  I'll tell you what.  But they don't shut up.  They just keep going.  You know, you figure get what you got to say out, and then it always ends with, all right, thanks, guys.  One more thing.  Oh, here you go.  They're kind of lonely out there.  They ain't got much.  They're just lonely, and they want to talk.  Hey, I went on.  I forget what I did, but I did some interview somewhere, but they were syndicated their show on XAMP.  And I think it was the Truckin' Bozo.  He's on XAMP. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, we heard about that guy.  Yes, we did.  And he's great.  I love the Truckin' Bozo.  So I go on Truckin' Bozo.  I'm supposed to do, like, 20 minutes with him.  I end up staying with the guy.  I went to the studio at, like, midnight, you know.  I end up staying with him until 4 o'clock in the morning.  And I did a show in Dayton, Ohio.  The next night, seven big rigs showed up.  They were in the area, and they heard it.  And seven big rigs showed up to the show and just parked out there in the parking lot.  Fucked it up so no one else could park.  Exactly.  There was seven people in the crowd.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  There was only seven people, but them truckers had to get down.  They had a good time.  Did you do any hunting?  I see you got the camo on you.  You know what?  I went bird hunting a couple weeks ago, but I didn't get nothing.  No?  I don't think I'm throwing the dogs up high enough.  But I got in trouble in Montana.  I shot an elk.  Yeah?  At the Elks Lodge.  And they didn't take right to that either, so.  Got to watch out for those Asians now when you're hunting.  Oh, my God.  That guy up there.  The Asian guy in Wisconsin that took out six hunters?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  You believe that?  Yeah.  Seems there was a – who knew there was a problem up there?  They had some Asian hunter, like, battle that's been going on for years, apparently.  Well, that's true.  Well, I guess that happened six miles from my girlfriend's hometown.  And she was kind of scared because her brother, her dad, and five of their buddies all went  to their private land hunting camp up there.  And I called her, and I said, hey, did you hear about it?  And she goes, no way.  So she hung up real quick, called, made sure everything was fine.  But, I mean, that's crazy. 
[02:19:00]  A bunch of good old boys get jumped by one Asian guy.  Well, look, next time you're going through the woods and you see an Asian guy in a deer  stand wearing the wrong kind of camo and a SKS assault rifle, get the hell out of there.  The only thing an Asian should be doing in the woods is massaging you and jerking you  off behind a tree.  I agree with that.  I got no problems with that.  Larry's with you, Jim.  He's with you.  I went up there for Thanksgiving.  And, by the way, I ate too much. 
[02:19:30]  I'm starting to have to buy relaxed fit condoms.  At least I'm gaining it in the right places, right?  But I go up there.  And my sister-in-law's up there.  And she just got all them piercings down, you know, in the area.  And y'all can tell when she's coming, you know, because she always wears a skirt.  She's got a, it sounds like a wind chime headed your way.  But she got a damn bolt in her, you know.  And she's showing people.  At the damn Thanksgiving, she's walking around.  Check this out. 
[02:20:00]  You rip her bricks.  And I'm like, oh, man, pull your pants up.  It looks like a BB stuck in a taffy puller.  Good Lord.  That's ruining my damn dinner right there.  It's insane.  But I don't know if any of them truckers, if you're down through southern Alabama,  I forget what town I was going through.  But I was on my way home one time.  And this true story, I come across a school called Hank Williams Junior High School.  I got to thinking, is that Hank Williams Junior High School? 
[02:20:30]  Or Hank Williams Junior High School?  So I was talking to some people.  It doesn't matter.  Nobody graduated from either one of them.  So I guess it was no big deal.  You've got a lot of fans calling in already.  I tell you what, I love the X-Am.  I love the satellite.  Them truckers, I love them to death.  I'll tell you.  I wanted to be, when I was a kid, I grew up on a pig farm in, believe it or not, southeast Nebraska.  But I moved to Florida way back in 70, back when I was 15. 
[02:21:00]  That's where I picked all my accent up and everything.  If you've ever been to Florida, people go to Florida and all that.  Well, yeah, they do.  You go to Central Florida, North Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got something going on.  It's just southern Georgia.  Yeah, but I wanted to be a, that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to drive a damn cattle truck.  I wanted to drive a pot-bellied cattle truck.  A cattle truck.  I wanted to drive a pot-bellied cattle truck when I was a kid.  The stinkiest trucks on the road.  Oh, I love it, love it.  Love it, love it, love it.  Let's say hi to Mike in Oklahoma City.  What's up, Mike? 
[02:21:30]  Hey, what's going on there?  M-80 haired, wrangler, bartent lips.  All right, wait, that's Ben.  Who's wrangler?  And I'm bird vag lips.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, not bad.  Anyhow, old big old Larry Cable Guy.  We're out here getting it done in a cattle truck.  What's up, Bubba?  Hey, are you at Bubba Gatorton?  Oh, you're good.  Hey, man.  There you go.  There you go.  When are you supposed to get down here to Oklahoma City again? 
[02:22:00]  I'm in Oklahoma City, I believe, in January.  Are you, what, down there at, uh, hell, I can't think of the name of that club down in Bricktown?  No, I'm at the theater there.  I'm at the arena, the Coliseum.  Yeah, he's playing arenas now, bro.  Yeah, I'll be at the car.  They don't play clubs anymore.  I just had a question for you.  On the, uh, TV show that y'all got with Foxworthy and, uh, and, uh, yes, and I apologize about  that for being funnier than them two guys.  What's that?  The question I had, uh, is that, uh, skit y'all did about, uh, the chewed up, pre-chewed 
[02:22:30]  food or whatever?  Yes, sir.  Who the hell's idea was that?  That's fucking gross.  Oh, you gotta explain, I said, that was, that was hilarious, actually.  You gotta explain it for the people that didn't see it.  Well, I'm gonna tell you, they did a sketch, and I was gone that day, uh, and I came back  and they were showing some sketches that they'd done, and they ran that one back, and I was  like, man, that's kinda gross.  What it is, is pre-chewed food was a sketch they did where the sketch was, yeah, are you 
[02:23:00]  taking too much time eating your food?  Goodwill, our creators here, and it just shows this factory line of people chewing food and  spitting it in the glasses, and then they package it, so you ain't gotta chew the food  and you suck it through the straw, and so they're going, you get apple pie, and it looks like  vomit that they're pouring out.  That was the bad part about it, because I was sitting there eating some of my wife's  spaghetti and meatballs, and I just about lost it right there.  Well, I gotta tell you, I said, and you can ask my buddies with me, I said, look, that's 
[02:23:30]  too gross, we cannot air it, I think that's too gross to air it, and so what we did was  we ran it back for the crowd, and Jeff goes, well, I'm gonna ask the crowd, and he goes,  listen, here's a bit we did, it's up to the audience, if you think we should air it, then  you'd let us know, and they said, air it, air it, of course, it was all a bunch of college  kids, they don't hear shit.  I think we should do that on the show for my fight.  I got one more super quick question for Larry, then I'll send it out.  You guys are never quick in Oklahoma City, you're kidding. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, you know what Tulsa spelled backward is?  An asshole?  No, a slut.  You know what a slut backward is?  A hundred dollars.  Hey, Larry, you know what noodling is, right?  A noodling?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  What is it?  Okay, explain it to them guys, I'm out, you guys have a good day.  Alright, thank you.  What is that?  Well, from what I understand, noodling, I think noodling, isn't noodling sticking your tongue 
[02:24:30]  in the butthole or something?  I don't know.  That's what I thought it was.  Jim?  Jim, you're an expert on that, no?  I would call that dinner prep.  No, I think noodling is drunk sex, no?  I don't know.  See, I've never heard the type of noodling.  I never did it.  See, now I thought that was tossing salad.  Right.  I've heard the tossing salad.  Somebody told me it was noodling.  I know, there's different terms for different things all across the country, but that's what  I heard it was.  I'm probably dead raw on it.  I don't eat an ass.  Tim in Jersey.  Tim, what's up? 
[02:25:00]  Hey, what's going on?  We're hanging with Larry the Cable Guy.  He's doing the Foxworthy roast tonight.  Yep.  Oh, excellent.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  Larry, can you do a couple analogies?  I heard them the other day and I was laughing my balls off.  Oh, yeah, sure.  I was more frustrated than a pervert with palsy trying to draw a vagina on an Etch-A-Scat.  Madden and Jesse Jackson at the airport having to answer the white courtesy phone.  Tripping and stumbling like Ray Charles walking through a pumpkin patch. 
[02:25:30]  I was going down like Barney Frank in a cheap motel.  I like that.  Madden and a legless Ethiopian wants you to donut roll down a hill.  Yeah, a lot of them.  Madden and an Amish electrician.  I don't know.  Now the truckers are coming out of the woodwork.  Oh, I love the truckers. 
[02:26:00]  Roy, what's up?  You know what noodling is?  Yeah, it's where you go catfishing with your hands.  You catch them with your hands.  Oh, see, I thought he was being dirty, see?  Yeah.  Well, we used to go to Nemaha River, and they used to go down there and punch them.  You go down there, and those big catfish.  Now, tell me if you've heard of this.  What's his name?  Roy.  Roy.  Roy, now that's when you go down in the river and you punch your hand in the catfish mouth and bring up the catfish. 
[02:26:30]  Is that not noodling?  Uh, I don't know if it's legal or not.  I guess in some places it's not legal, but.  It doesn't matter if it's legal.  Is that what noodling is, where you punch the catfish?  Yeah, that's what noodling is, yeah.  It really is?  Yeah, they build these boxes and sink them down in the river, and I guess the catfish is laying in them boxes and wait for food to come to them.  Well, then these guys go back to those boxes, stick their hand in there, and catch catfish.  Yeah, but that, we just called that punch and catfish. 
[02:27:00]  Just punch and catfish.  See, I heard that noodling was licking some girl's butt.  Don't need a name for it.  I heard it was.  Put a little noodle in and then go out and punch some catfish.  Maybe it's licking a catfish's butt.  I was going to say, that's a lot different than licking ass.  I got both of them mixed up.  Yeah, that's a lot different than licking ass.  Playing with an ass, punching a catfish, it doesn't matter, your fingers smell the same.  They really do.  Either way, it looks like you got out of the WNBA locker room. 
[02:27:30]  Good Lord, we just had some trouble here recently.  My neighbor come over, he's all upset.  Apparently, his nephew just got kicked out of school down here in Florida for having sex with his 10th grade teacher.  And the funny part is, he's homeschooled.  So we were all upset about it.  A little upset about that, huh?  Vanilla Thunder from Philly.  What's up, Vanilla Thunder?  What's up, man? 
[02:28:00]  For my fly, I'd go to a Larry the Cable Guy concert in blackface.  Oh.  That would be a little rough.  Yeah.  What do you want to do that for?  All right.  Is it all rednecks at your shows, Larry?  Well, you know what?  That's a misconception.  That's why I'm asking.  There are all kinds of, and I'm going to tell you what, the black crowds laughed.  I went on a Steve Harvey show in Los Angeles, and we had the best damn time, because I do good.  The black guys really acknowledge that Steve Harvey is black. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  I have, and it's, you know, I have all different kinds of crowds that come to my show.  And just because I talk this way don't mean it's just all rednecks coming to my show.  I mean, it's everybody.  And I tell everybody, the worst crowds to perform for, and Jim Norton will tell you this, too.  I like, I don't care who's come to my show, as long as you like to laugh, but the ones  that are the most uptight are those real rich white liberals.  Absolutely.  And they have to analyze every joke before they can laugh at it. 
[02:29:00]  They're the first.  That's what I always say about that.  Like, I'll do a joke.  Like, I'm on stage.  Every now and then, my shadow will be behind me.  And I'll go.  So then I was, and I act like I'm scared.  And I look, and I go, oh, good Lord, I thought a black guy was sneaking up behind me.  Right?  And people laugh.  And you know what?  And I do that because the black crowd loves that.  I think that's the funniest damn thing they ever heard.  But you look at these uptight white people.  They have to look around to see who's laughing at them.  And they just piss me off. 
[02:29:30]  And those are the same people that'll come up to you, that was a racist joke.  Then they'll get in their car, and they're the first one to lock their door when they  go down a bad part of town.  Absolutely.  You know what I mean?  Well, they have some sense.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  They're afraid that laughing is like a win.  Because they really are real condescending paternalists, racists.  And they're afraid that by laughing, that's an acknowledgment of like, oh, yeah, I really  do feel that way.  Yeah.  It's insane.  It's insane.  But no, I love all my courage.  Whoever comes to see my show, they're just going to laugh.  And we're all going to have a good time.  And forget about it.  Early on, it must have been a lot of just rednecks in small clubs, though. 
[02:30:00]  Well, you know, I built my following on radio.  I used to do very politically incorrect social commentaries.  Right.  And I mean, I would just say, hey, this is, because I'm not, I deem myself as a regular  dude.  I'm just, you know, I go home, and I do like, you know, I'm riding a horse, I'm four-wheeling,  I'm going down to Hooters, I'm hanging out with my buddies, I'm shooting pool.  I mean, I'm a regular guy like they are.  So, when it comes to politics and stuff, I'll just say it the way I feel, and you know,  I like it, and kiss my ass, you know? 
[02:30:30]  That's it.  But the main part of it is, you want to be funny, you're a comedian, so you just try  to, it's like when I tell everybody, it's like, Bill Hicks was a buddy of mine.  I love Bill Hicks.  He's my favorite, by the way, of all time.  He used to date my ex-manager, Colleen.  And, but I didn't agree with one thing, I'm pretty right-wing, but I didn't agree with  anything he said, religiously or politically.  Yeah, he was pretty out there, left.  But I went to see Bill Hicks, because he made me damn laugh.  The guy was freaking funny.  Yeah, I'm the same way.  Exactly.  And that's what I tell everybody, and that people go to a show, and they'll be pissed 
[02:31:00]  off, and go, what the hell you going to a Bill Hicks show for?  Right, right.  You know, people are just insane.  They'll go see stuff.  His comedy was brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Oh, yeah, he was insanely funny.  You know, I mean, he would take his time on that stage, and there would be silence, because  people were just listening.  Yeah, but.  You know, you guys know, when you do a comedy show, there's a lot of uptight people,  in the audience.  They'd need a laugh every two minutes, you know?  Yeah, people got to realize they're at a comedy club, you know, and that's the one place  you can go, set aside all your problems, and have a good time. 
[02:31:30]  But yeah, them politically uptight white crowd pissed me off, but the majority of them are  real good.  Audiences seem to think now, and this is the part of the problem, that they're part of  the creative process, and they have to agree with your ideology to laugh at it, and it  just, it makes you want to bite somebody's face.  Like, I don't agree with anything Paul Mooney says, but I'll still laugh watching him, because  he's a good comic.  Man, he's the biggest racist.  Fine, let him be.  As long as he's funny, I don't care.  You know what I mean?  I'm waiting.  Remember, we interviewed Paul Mooney, man. 
[02:32:00]  I thought we were going to get killed.  There's some people, yeah, I get pissed off that I am laughing, because it's like, God,  I hate what this guy's saying, but it's funny.  It's so funny that I can't stand him.  That's what alternative comics, this is the problem with alternative comics, they don't  have the gift necessary to make their political opinions funny, so they're like, well, we're  just doing something different, because they're not talented enough to make it.  Look, how funny is Marc Maron?  I don't agree with anything he says, but he's a funny guy, he's a good comic.  Are you talking about Janine Garofalo, too?  Oh, she's super.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Oh, she's super.  As soon as he said that, I'm like, he's talking about Janine Garofalo, with her stupid notebook, 
[02:32:30]  making believe she's just trying out material.  Dude, you don't get it.  The movie Roots is funnier than her.  The movie Roots?  That was funny.  You should never let the black girl turn around when she gets your water for you.  Yeah, we're not big fans of Janine Garofalo on this show, at all.  She did the first episode of Tough Crowd, maybe it was eight test episodes we got, and 
[02:33:00]  she hated my guts.  Of course she did.  Because I did a coyote's age joke, and from there on in, it was just brutal.  You know, I will say this about her, though, and that's why, you know, I never thought she's  funny, but she gets her crowd.  I mean, she's found her audience.  That's what you got to do as comedians, find your audience, and they go, and they go by  1,500 a night, 2,000 a night, and they laugh, and you don't know what the hell they're  laughing at, but they're laughing.  They don't either.  They're just like, wow, she's brilliant.  It's just kind of being channeled through her.  And they hand out free flannel after the show. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Not one dick in that audience.  And a free haircut.  Tim in Wisconsin, another trucker.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, not bad.  How's it going, O&A?  We're hanging with Larry the Cable Guy.  Larry.  Yes, sir.  Hey, get her done.  Get her done.  Hey, what I want to know is, was your wife from Birchwood or Exlin?  No, it's not my wife.  It's my girlfriend.  She was actually from a little town called Spooner. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know where that is.  The Spooner Rails.  Yeah, Spooner.  That's where she...  Yeah, the rails.  I think your grandpa owns the whole town.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was...  It's like a foreign language when these two are talking.  Well, have you ever been to Spooner?  Hell no.  Well, you can't take enough film for that trip.  I'll tell you what, though.  Wisconsin is one of the most beautiful states in the country.  If you ever get a chance to go up there.  I don't think I will.  I don't think I'll ever get the chance. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, it's nice.  Colder than a witch's tit, though, this morning up here.  Yeah.  Nine degrees we got right now.  Hey, Ben, why don't you run over there and open all the bathroom windows there in Wisconsin?  There you have it.  All right.  Some freak.  And those witch's tits, they get real...  Yeah.  You ever just grab one?  Yeah, what does that mean?  Yeah.  They've been saying that for years.  I know.  What does it mean?  I've never even seen a witch's tit to tell.  I remember we went up there.  I got a rent-a-car up there in Wisconsin.  And by the way, if you ever get a rent-a-car and you want to cheat on the mileage, don't 
[02:35:00]  use whiteout.  They figured that out.  They got that shit figured out.  But I got one of those rent-a-cars that had a voice.  I don't know if you've ever seen this, Jim, if you get rent-a-cars, but it had a voice  activated radio, one of those new radios.  Like, if you want to hear country music, you just sit there and you go, country music.  And it'll come on.  And then you go, like, rock and roll.  And it'll come on.  So I wanted to hear some country music.  And I was about to say country.  And some lady cut me off leaving the parking lot.  And I yelled out to the window, you stupid bitch.  You know, because I was pissed.  And I said, stupid bitch. 
[02:35:30]  And Dr. Laura, come on the radio.  I had to listen to Dr. Laura all the way down to Spooner.  Spooner.  Unbelievable.  Go and take on the day.  She really should be killed in a boating accident.  That's something like this whore.  We got lots of phone calls coming in.  Ellis in Philly.  What's up, Ellis?  Yo, man, this is the best guest you guys have had on ever.  He's great, man.  It's the only guest we've had on lately.  No offense to Larry the Cable Guy, but let's be honest here.  It's not like the guests are pounding down the door to come on the new Opie and Anthony 
[02:36:00]  show yet.  They should be.  All right.  Yeah, they ought to be.  They're good folks in here.  You know, I was up in, I used to work up in Philly.  Did you ever used to work at, a long time ago, at Funny Bone up on South Street?  I think I did an open mic.  I started in 1990, so I think they were kind of winding down by that time, early 90s.  Yeah, they were eating it then, yeah.  I remember I opened up.  It was me and Paula Poundstone in 1987, I think.  That was when everyone was a stand-up comic.  Oh, everybody and their sister. 
[02:36:30]  Was she touching kids back then?  No.  No, no, no.  She diddled my butt a little bit.  She noodled me.  She punched you in the face?  She punched me in the face and stuck a finger, man.  Which definition of the noodling did you get from Paula Poundstone?  Hopefully the punching in the face.  Well, I've been hearing your name, like, long before the Blue Collar Tour and that stuff.  All the club you hear, you know, Larry the Cable Guy, and you were on the same circuit  I was on, but for years you heard the name, and it was like, you know, in the Midwest 
[02:37:00]  and all these places, you were just getting huge.  Yeah, I just, I love Blue Collar TV.  I never thought it took off, but, like, how long ago?  Because it really just took off.  Yeah, well, we did that movie about three years ago.  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, but we had been touring with it for three years.  No kidding.  And, you know, it's just...  Arenas, right?  Yeah, we did arenas, and, you know, it's a credit to the fans, because the fans just want  to come out and laugh and have a good time, and I think that's the thing they could do 
[02:37:30]  with us, because none of us cared about the PC stuff.  We wanted to do what we thought was funny.  Right.  And we wanted to do stuff that every day people come across, you know.  And it was four different styles.  You had Foxworthy, you had Engvall, you had Mean, you had Ron White, and all four of us  are completely different.  So you had something for everybody, so it was real good.  But the thing I liked about it was, of course, all the New York and L.A. critics, you know,  if you don't have a gay character, you don't have this, or you don't have that, you're not  a good show. 
[02:38:00]  Of course, Blue Collar TV, you know, we're just doing what we do.  Of course, they all trashed it, then the ratings came back through the roof.  Bravo.  And so, then you don't hear nothing from the critics.  Of course not.  Of course not.  A lot of calls from PA today.  Rich, what's up?  What's up, man?  I just want to see if Sensei, if he searched the cable guy.  Oh, Master Poe, did Master Poe search you?  Are you carrying?  No, hell no, I ain't carrying him.  I left it in the cab.  Yeah, Master Poe is our, I don't know, he's, what is he? 
[02:38:30]  He's security.  He's an assassin.  Well, he come up, he goes, will you fill this out for me, please?  I'm like, what the hell?  Address, ID number, social security number, take a picture.  Do you know who he, Master Poe, do you know who he is?  Yes, I do.  He's the biggest star we're going to ever get.  Yes, I threw him up against the wall, but I'm sorry.  Did you make him fill out 30 minutes of paperwork like everyone else?  No, no.  You treat him different than the sluts that come in here, right?  Absolutely.  He made me French kiss him.  Now, what is that? 
[02:39:00]  I didn't figure that part of it out.  That's kind of a game.  That's lucky.  That's called lucky.  Yeah, especially that thing that you're chewing.  I don't know if I could handle that.  I always got to have a dip in the morning.  You don't know what dip's all about there, Master Poe?  No, I don't.  You don't dip?  No, no.  You like to dip there, right?  Yeah, I do enjoy a good dip.  Yeah.  I tried to quit, but I can't.  I said, well, I started doing it a long time ago, but then I quit there for a while, 
[02:39:30]  and then I started gaining weight, and I said, you know what, I'm going to start dipping  so I don't get fat, and then I started still eating, so now I want to be fat with no teeth.  That was a real good decision on my part.  Pretty soon I'll have a gay guy.  You want to blend in with your audience.  Pretty soon I'll have a gay guy looking at me going, you know, maybe we should just be friends.  Hey, you been to Hooters lately?  We're not big Hooters.  I've been there in a while.  Yeah, we're not big Hooters fans.  We used to go a couple of years ago.  We'll tell you why.  We think they've got to get new outfits.  They're still wearing the 80s shorts. 
[02:40:00]  The orange 80s shorts.  And they're getting shorter.  Hooters, I went in there, and I was like, man, if these shorts get any shorter, the FDA's  going to start making these girls wear hair in that.  I mean, it's not sanitary.  I was leaving.  She goes, how was everything?  I was, you know, everything was good.  What the hell?  I'm not a big fan of Hooters anymore.  I went through the Hooters stage.  Well, they're suing, what's that, Wing House?  The Wing House in Florida opened up.  Yeah.  And they're competing with the Hooters, they go to Wing House. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, that's pretty good.  What do they got?  Girls in better little outfits.  It's just the same as Hooters, but they got different uniforms.  The girls are skankier, right?  Different cost names.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  Probably get the hot outfits.  I hate the shorts they wear in Hooters.  They're like the old roller boogie movie from the 70s.  They all get the...  And then they're not really showing their legs.  That's whatever, right?  They wear those stockings that are...  Like burlap.  Awful.  I like it at Wing House.  You can actually get a blowjob and a macaroni salad.  It's on the menu. 
[02:41:00]  That's great.  I can say macaroni salad on the radio.  You ever used to be able to say macaroni salad?  You figured out this satellite radio, huh?  All right.  We have to get you out of here at 9, really?  What time is it?  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  You can stay for a few more, right?  No, I can stay for a while.  We have to do that run-through for the roast at 10.30.  So I'm supposed to be in the lobby at 10 o'clock or something.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break, and we'll continue with Larry the Cable Guy.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, big F.U.  Oh, hey, you guys are killing me.  I just got XM, and I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I haven't heard that in three years, and I finally got it out of my head.  You guys are going to start playing it again.  Yeah, I want to leave a big F.U. to Howard Stern.  500 million fucking dollars?  What the fuck?  I have serious crashes and fucking burns, and they have to pay Howard Stern all that money.  Regardless. 
[02:42:00]  Fuck him.  XM Radio's number one, and always will be.  Yeah, I want to send a big fuck you to that fucking truck driver that called in this morning.  You know, it's assholes like you that make the rest of us look bad.  You know, we don't need your shit on the Opie and Anthony show.  You're a fucking cracker head.  Shut up.  Get behind the fucking wheel.  Get on down the road.  Take your fucking shower, you fucking stinky piece of shit.  Shut up.  Opie, this is Jason and Buffalo.  Fuck you, bro.  Don't even dream of giving Rich Voss a couple hours on high voltage or the listeners. 
[02:42:30]  I want the fucking replays.  There's no way I'm getting up at six in the morning and listening to you assholes.  I want to listen during the middle of the day, the middle of the night, whenever I want.  Not when you're on, and then not have to listen to Voss during the day.  Fuck you, bro.  Do that.  I'm canceling my descriptors.  Here comes Kenny.  It's Club Soda Kenny.  He's big, and he's dumb, and he's chocked till it comes.  Here comes Kenny.  Hey, it's a big pet.  Fuck you.  Which everyone eat retards does the fucking, uh, shit. 
[02:43:00]  Maybe next time.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.

That comes out on DVD December 7th.  Nice.  Good Christmas present.  Just in time for Christmas.  And really fast, you were talking about the wing house.  It looks just like Hooters with a different logo.  Oh, it's the same thing.  That is great, but the girls are really, really, really high.  They like higher supermodels in that place.  Wow.  You think these girls are actually serving the wings? 
[02:47:30]  Come on, now.  Are they?  Yeah.  Maybe once a month they're doing it, just so they could...  There's some good-looking ones.  Wow, she is a good one.  Yeah, they're like supermodels.  But I still like Hooters, so who am I to say?  All right.  And I went to the bathroom, and I think I missed a couple good stories, because I walk  in, and it's going, oh, my God, wow, what?  Well, Larry's on the road all the time, so he does a lot of radio.  And kind of did radio for years, I guess.  Yeah, I started doing radio in 1991.  And you know Ron from Ron and Ron? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, yeah, I started with Ron and Ron.  Yeah, they're good folks.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're good friends of ours.  Ron and Fez now.  The Ron and Fez version is really, really funny, too.  They're talking about some people that just don't get it.  In radio?  Yeah, yeah.  How about just about everyone?  Well, I was telling them, I called this guy the other day, doing some country station.  I don't remember where it was at, Indiana or something.  And I love doing my call-ins, but every now and then you'll get one guy that's king of  the small town. 
[02:48:30]  But he came on, and he goes, 99 Froggy.  And he had that voice, and he was like, but everything was a frog reference.  And everything, I mean, for the Froggy's Day, he was like.  There's one of those in PA, too, man.  But I called up and he goes, Larry, have you done a Froggy's Day show bizarre?  And I said, yeah, I've done several Froggy's.  Well, my name's Hoppy John.  We're having a hoppy day here at Froggy.  We're in the swamp today.  Tadpole's going to call us later.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  Everything was about the frog.  Oh, dude, I'm laughing my ass off, you know.  And he goes, hey, you're going to be working where Dolly Parton was.  And I go, yeah, Archie changed your name to Emerson Beggins, like Emerson Drive, you  know.  And he goes, okay, let's stop this.  Okay, we can't say that on the radio.  And I go, you can't say Emerson Beggins?  This is a very family-oriented program.  And then he said it like that.  This is a very family-oriented program.  Hold on a second.  Let's start again. 
[02:49:30]  Talking out of the house.  This guy's insane.  Oh, okay, you were taping for, oh, man.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  That's hilarious.  Emerson Beggins, he got pissed at that?  Emerson Beggins.  Come on.  I know, it was insane.  Should have gone on right at the next one after he did his big intro and he goes, I guess  cunt's out of the question.  Well, there goes that bit.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Cunt's only bad if you use it as an adverb.  Really? 
[02:50:00]  Yep.  Way to stop the show.  Yeah, Larry's killing over here and you ought to do that.  Just figured I'd chime in with a little English language.  A little English lesson.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Just completely remind people how bad it could be today.  Hey, I saw that show for the first time.  I don't get a lot of time to watch TV, but I was home for the holidays and we was watching  The Apprentice.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, I think that's the dumbest show I've seen my whole life.  I blew it off.  I can't be bothered by that show.  I mean, here's a game show and first prize is a job.  So, who the hell wants to win a freaking job on a game? 
[02:50:30]  Put a washer and dryer on there for God's sake.  What's second place?  That's a great point.  I never even thought of that.  What's second place?  Homework?  You know, it's ridiculous.  I like that.  But I did hear, though, the last show, the big finale, Donald Trump's going to get his  hair imploded.  So, we'll be looking forward to that.  What show we like?  We like The Swan.  Have you seen The Swan?  I've never seen The Swan.  Do cosmetic surgery on these freaks in H here?  They get these women and they all have mental problems. 
[02:51:00]  They were abused and they've grown up.  And they have some horrendous problem.  One woman last week, no teeth.  She lost all her teeth at 25 years old.  So, she's crying.  And it's not due to an accident or anything like that.  She's a lazy brother.  They want to brush her teeth.  So, she popped her teeth out.  And they talk about what they're going to do to them through the whole show.  And at the end, they parade them out and they all make them just look like strippers.  Like cheap, bubble-headed, blonde, big-titted strippers. 
[02:51:30]  And it's great to get these women that have no self-confidence whatsoever.  They've been abused.  They're crying through half of the episode.  And then ask them what size tits they want.  Because they just think that the bigger the tits, the better they're going to feel about  themselves.  The better guys are going to treat them.  And they all wind up coming in for the big reveal at the end with just these gigantuan  rib-huge tits.  Yeah, they make them all look like strippers, basically.  Big blonde head.  The collagen in their lips.  It's a great show.  Face lifts, brow lifts, liposuction.  It's unbelievable what they do to these girls. 
[02:52:00]  And that is going to make men treat them better, though.  That's actually a very accurate thought process.  It absolutely does make men treat them better.  Because they're just slobs when they start.  You can just watch the first five minutes, watch their sob story, and then watch the last  five minutes.  The rest of the show is all bullshit.  And my sister-in-law is cancer, and I lost my third child.  I need some tits.  It'll just make things change much better.  That's exactly it.  That's exactly the show.  I'm getting a divorce.  My brother lost seven pounds in seven minutes. 
[02:52:30]  Seven pounds in seven minutes.  That's right.  He flossed his teeth.  Bada bing.  We need a drummer here.  That's what's getting me on the big shows, Norton.  That's it.  Cunt is an adverb.  Back after this, folks.  Yeah, you've got to be a little smarter with your comedy.  Like Larry the Cable Guy.  Yeah, right?  That's real heady right there.  What's the Cable Guy story? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, when I first started doing call-ins, I was doing a cable installer on stage.  And my buddy Ron said, man, that's funny.  You've got to call the morning show, and you've got to do that.  I mean, that's funny.  We need some characters on there.  And I said, all right, I'll give you a holler.  But I can't just, what am I just going to call up and start bitching about politics?  You've got to have a reason to call up.  And, well, I guess they were waiting on the cable guy to call for a couple of days, and 
[02:53:30]  he never did.  So since I was doing a cable installer, I just called up as a cable guy.  And the name people were just like, man, that was funny.  Of course, they called me.  They said, who's this?  And I said, it's Larry.  And they said, Larry.  Yeah, the cable guy.  Oh, we've been waiting on you.  So then we riffed into some bits, and people were like, man, that's funny, that Larry  the cable guy.  Was that a real guy, or is that?  Of course, we told everybody it was a real guy that called.  And it just kind of stuck, and I just started being known as Larry the cable guy, and then 
[02:54:00]  I started getting on more stations, and so I just toured as Larry the cable guy.  Then you can't change it after so long.  Right.  Well, people kind of know you by it.  Yeah, people know me by that now.  Well, that's my problem.  Opie, I hate the name.  He's got to go around and start with me now forever.  I got it when I was 12.  If it worked.  It worked for a couple of years.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Opie's a great nickname for a kid.  Right.  It's not a radio name.  It's not a radio name.  It was a stupid name I got when I was 12.  I'm stuck with it.  And I truly want to change my name for the radio, but now we've been doing this for  10 years. 
[02:54:30]  I can't.  Well, yeah.  Well, you're both millionaires, so your nicknames are working out very nicely.  Very nice.  They can call me Jim the Tommy Morrison's blood sample.  Hey, a little more clever.  See, I didn't go with the answer to Magic Johnson.  People would recognize you.  Let's go see the blood sample.  He's down here.  You call like hundreds of stations.  I was up to 27.  I think there was a time we were trying to get you when we were up in Boston, but it  just didn't work out because you were calling.  It was ridiculous. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, I was up to 27.  Every morning you just wake up and just one after another, right?  Yes, sir.  6 to 11 every morning, but it was fun.  I enjoyed it.  It was a good time.  Met a lot of nice people.  Yeah.  But you'd set these up like a week in advance, right?  No, you had, boom, you know, these Tuesdays, Wednesdays.  I knew who I was going to call, what times I was going to call, but, you know, all the  stations I called, the majority of them, just great guys.  I mean, we all got along, and so it was fun.  It was more fun than it was.  There was never really a station you'd call and go, man, I hate calling these freaking  morons.  You know?  Yeah.  So it was all real good.  There was plenty of them. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oof.  Oof, what about you doing the Foxworthy roast?  Yeah, we're doing the roast, and that ought to be pretty fun, you know, because I'm kind  of like...  What are you going to bash them about, anything?  Yeah, give us a little preview, no?  Give us one, two?  I think I say one thing in there where I go, Jeff Foxworthy's show, oh, he was once called  the worst actor ever in a sitcom, and that was at the same time that the retard Corky from  life goes on was that, and I go, you're really bad if you're not even better than crippled 
[02:56:00]  actors.  Yeah, that's good.  That's funny.  Christopher Reeve was watching this show and actually got up and turned the chair.  I'll probably get shit on that, but it's funny, funny.  Screw it.  Go with it.  He's kidding.  There's a good lineup tonight, too.  It's you, it's all the guys in the blue collars, right?  Yeah, it's me, Bill, Ron, it's going to be Nick DiPaolo, who's one of my favorite comedian 
[02:56:30]  of all time, Nick.  Angry Nick.  Nick's great.  And then, you know, DeCastroix.  Colin, I think.  Dr. Collins in there, and Dennis Leary.  Okay.  So there's a few of them in there.  Hell yeah.  We got some ringers.  We're supposed to go to that.  Well, we can't go out anymore.  But we can't go out.  It's the goddamn morning radio.  We have to get up at four.  Yeah, you got to go to Bet 7.  By 6.30 at night.  I try to stretch it to eight, but you're kind of looking like, oh boy.  Yeah, it's just about bedtime. 
[02:57:00]  Are the tickets available for that tonight, or is it sold out?  I think it's sold out tonight.  I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it is.  Yeah, it looked like all them tables had name places on them, so I think they pretty  much sold out.  All right.  Larry in Texas.  What's up, Larry?  Not too much, man.  Good morning, all in eight.  How are you?  Hi, mister.  I just got a quick question, or actually two of them.  One, real quick, what is a roast?  I'm not too familiar with the comedian language.  It's where you stick your tongue up somebody's ass, and then you put your fist in a catfish. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, shit.  All right.  Second question.  Larry.  No, a roast is where you just, whoever the celebrity's getting roasted, you just go  up and you just tell jokes about them.  That's basically it.  It's like the old, do you ever see the old Dean Martin roast, the old Milton Berle roast?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's just like that.  And they're pretty vicious, too, a lot of them.  Yeah, they get vicious.  Because it's all comedians shitting on each other, and comedians are vicious to each 
[02:58:00]  other, so they're really, roasts are very funny.  Okay, you'll probably hear the word cock somewhere.  Yeah.  Okay.  Second question.  Larry, the cable guy, and for Jimmy Norton, are y'all going to be doing any shows down  in the Houston area in the near future?  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm at the Houston Improv.  I mean, I'm a truck driver.  I'm a truck driver, and the only time I can really get to places to see you guys is when  I'm at home.  I'm at the Houston Improv in January, and I think Larry will be doing the Astrodome sometime  right after that. 
[02:58:30]  That's kind of hard.  That's kind of hard to do the Astrodome.  Actually, no, but actually, I'm taping my new live album January 14th and 15th at the  Verizon Wireless Theater down there.  Is that in Houston?  In Houston.  If you tell me that's when I'm in Houston and I have to compete with him, I'm going  to fucking smash my agent right in the mouth.  I'm looking at Norton.  He's checking right now.  I'm checking.  He's not even going to wait for the commercial break.  All right.  Thank you, Larry.  Appreciate you, Larry. 
[02:59:00]  Hey.  All right.  Hey, Angel Eyes.  No, you're not going to get him, bro.  I might be there in February.  No, real quick.  When you go to Houston, where are you going to be appearing at?  Last week.  What's that?  When you go to Houston, where are you going to be on stage at?  Last week of January, I'm in, I believe, the Houston Improv.  Oh, the Houston Improv?  Yes.  Can we talk about Houston Comedy Clubs a little more, please?  See what I said?  Hold on.  What's that, sir?  The truckers love to talk.  Go ahead, Larry. 
[02:59:30]  No, it's not that I would love to talk.  I'm just trying to get information so I can take my girl there to see it.  Well, Norton's got a...  Larry.  Oh, my God.  Norton's got a website.  Trucker time's up.  All right.  Trucker time's up.  That's the alarm.  Eatabullet.com, sir.  That's my website.  You can go.  But, yeah, I'll be there, thank God, two weeks after Larry.  All right.  Keep driving a crank truck.  I don't know what the hell was going on there.  They love the crystal meth.  They love to talk.  And they love killing hookers and throwing them on the side of the road.  That's pretty much the trucker credo. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, we're starting to learn about the truckers.  That's about it, right?  A little too much.  God bless the truckers.  I keep saying lounge lizards.  The lot lizards.  Yeah, the lot lizards.  Yeah, they have the lot lizards, the chicks, the scabby chicks that walk around the truck stops and have sex with the guys.  There's a few of them down there, but you don't want to touch them.  It was funny.  One time I was leaving, this was about four years ago.  I'm leaving a show I did in Jacksonville.  I'm driving my truck.  I got a big old Dodge on a 12-inch with 38, 15, 40 Mickeys on it. 
[03:00:30]  So I'm driving.  I got my CB in there.  I'm driving down.  And one trucker told a joke to another trucker.  So I got on there, and I did a joke, and they laughed.  And I did another joke, and they laughed.  I did like five minutes of my routine.  And all of a sudden, there's one trucker going, come on, keep it coming, boy.  And the other one goes, yeah, come on, let's hear some more.  So the whole way home, man, I did my act.  The whole way home on the damn CB.  The damn CB.  They had no idea.  It was you.  It was great.  That's great. 
[03:01:00]  Do you know what these are?  Oh, yeah.  We're still trying to figure this crap out.  Someone sent us these.  Some people say it's pretty popular in the Midwest and South.  Oh, plastic bullnuts.  Yeah, you put them on the back of your truck there.  See, he knows.  Matter of fact, if you've got a pair, I could use one of them.  Oh, you could do it.  Would you like the tan one?  You know, I like the flesh-cutter.  Yeah, give them the flesh-colored one.  Flesh-cutter bullnuts from my truck.  God bless you.  You put them on the back of your truck?  Well, why?  This is the best Christmas ever.  So happy.  That's so your truck has balls. 
[03:01:30]  No, I was down in Tulsa.  We had a bullnut fry down in Tulsa.  Really?  Yeah, my buddy.  My best friend lives down there in South Cosbyville.  Now, is there any reason to eat those?  They are unbelievably good.  You can't get out of your head what they are.  You go to a bullnut fry, I'm telling you, you will not eat anything better than bullnuts.  Really?  Oh, they taste better than a cheerleader on game day.  These bullnuts.  What do they taste like?  Chicken?  That's what everyone says.  Yeah, kind of.  Yeah.  But they're just good. 
[03:02:00]  You put little sauces on them.  We almost did that on the show.  Just to try it.  I've seen people cook them.  They slice them real thin and kind of.  Yeah, you don't want to eat them in their natural form.  Like an apple.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a pair of nuts on a piece of bread.  A pair of nuts on a piece of bread, my guy.  So fresh, the bull goes, ow, and you bite down on it.  And the penis fingers are good, too, if you've ever had the penis fingers.  There's just so much that is edible on a steer that by the time you get to the nuts, I think 
[03:02:30]  I'm full.  Yeah.  You know?  I'll take the worst cut of steak there is.  You know?  Eat the grizzle, even.  Yeah, I'll eat the grizzle.  I don't care.  It's like you're foraging off a squirrel for something.  There's plenty of meat there.  No, thank you.  But put them on the truck, sure.  Hey, Larry likes that one a lot, eh?  Oh, God dang, that's funny.  That's funny than watching midgets run track right there. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, Lord.  My brother, he wanted me to help him name his bowling team the other day.  He's got a bowling team.  And he came up with, what did he come up with?  His was the Lane Brains.  Lane Brains.  And I said, why don't you name them the I ain't got nothing else to do on a Friday either.  Ethers.  He ain't a good bowler.  I went to watch him bowl last Wednesday and I caught a ball.  Our own Steve did that. 
[03:03:30]  Steve threw one off the wall last time we played.  Yeah.  But he likes to drink a little bit.  He likes his martinis.  That's why we call him Martini Steve.  Yeah.  I don't drink anymore.  I used to drink, but the neighbors got up a petition.  And I don't care what they say.  I still say them puppies don't look nothing like me.  That was a rough night that night.  Jimmy, you know what I'm talking about.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  A couple more calls and we'll get you out of here. 
[03:04:00]  Dwayne from Nebraska.  What's up?  Huskers.  What's going on, guys?  Go Huskers.  Yeah, man.  That's what I was going to call you about.  What do you think of those guys this year, huh?  First losing season since 1961.  I'm a big Nebraska Cornhusker fan.  And I've never been alive when they've had a losing team in five and six.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Really?  Always been going to a ball game or something like that.  Yeah, that streak, the national streak ended.  Nebraska's the only team that had the streak 38 straight years going to ball games. 
[03:04:30]  And they're not going this year for the first time.  Didn't they one year, I'm not a college football fan, but didn't they one year have a big record  and they were going for the win instead of just taking the tie and the guy dropped the two-point conversion in the end zone?  I think that's my only college football memory is watching the basketball.  Look at you.  Yeah, a few years ago.  You know what?  And Tom Osborne did that.  And I always give it.  We in Nebraska always give him credit for that.  Because a lot of those teams, back when they were doing that, they would kick the extra point.  Because if you're the number one team in the country, you're not beat.  You're the only undefeated team.  You're going to win the national championship.  We're playing Miami. 
[03:05:00]  And we're the only undefeated team in the country.  And we tied it up.  And with just a few seconds to go in the game.  And instead of kicking that extra point to win the title, we went for two.  We said, we're going to win it.  We're going to win it outright.  And, of course, we didn't get it.  But, well, Osborne had some nuts.  And then I ate them on a sandwich.  On Wonder Bread.  Yeah, but no, they'll get better.  Keep the faith.  All right.  Dave and Maine.  Wait, one more question.  Go, go, go.  Would that have tied it?  Or would that have won the game?  That would have won the game.  The extra point would have tied it.  The extra point would have tied it.  And they'd have won the national title. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, the extra point would have tied it.  But they went for two.  Yeah.  Wow.  But I used to.  I never played football when I was in high school.  I was a big dude.  And I was in the band.  And everybody called me a sissy little fag.  You know.  But I love the baton.  I've got to tell you.  I've always been a fan of the little tights and the camel toes.  Loved it.  Dave and Maine.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, how are you doing?  We're Maine with Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, you guys rock.  Hey, but I know you're having trouble saying a lot, Lizard. 
[03:06:00]  You've got so 80s.  You've got to be politically correct now.  They are sleeper creepers.  Sleeper creepers.  Okay.  That's right.  We're still learning.  We're learning every day about you guys.  All right.  Well, you guys rock.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, bye.  This is service for everything.  And John in Tulsa.  What's up, John?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You tell us.  Hello.  Hi.  Yeah, I'm just going to tell you.  You need to get him a bull dick cane to go along with those bull nuts you got.  A bull dick cane? 
[03:06:30]  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Now, that I haven't seen.  You've never seen a bull dick cane?  Oh, a cane.  You've got it all over.  Oh, a cane.  I've seen that.  I thought you said a chain.  No, I have seen the cane.  It's actually, they take the bull penis and they stretch it out and dry it out and make  a cane out of it.  A cane.  Am I correct, sir?  He's gone.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  And they stretch it out and make a cane out of it.  Yeah.  A bull dick cane.  You need that?  No.  Well, you don't want to look too uppity for the women.  Yeah.  You know, you don't want to do that. 
[03:07:00]  I mean, you want to make them think you've got money, but that's a little overdoing.  That is over the top.  That's over the top.  I went to my Talladega this year.  Yeah.  And I got an up-close look at the Viagra car.  Did you know Viagra car is the only car that has windshield wipers on the inside?  I didn't know that, but when I was up there, I did.  I don't get the racing either.  I got a buddy of mine.  You don't get racing?  I don't get it.  Oh, man.  NASCAR is like the greatest sport of all time.  My brother lived in Daytona for like seven, eight years. 
[03:07:30]  He gets it.  He tries to explain to me.  I don't get it.  I watch for the crashes, which is the obvious thing to say, but that's why I watch.  It's the greatest sport of all time.  And I was pissed off when they fined Earnhardt for cussing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's NASCAR.  I mean, that's that political.  You can't cuss in NASCAR.  And he was cursing on the radio as he's racing, right?  Yeah.  It's like, man.  Wasn't it nice you can't pee in the pool during synchronized swimming?  You know?  I mean, it's ridiculous.  What did he say?  Shit.  Oh, okay.  But he won.  He was all excited, and he didn't mean to do it. 
[03:08:00]  And, of course, they fined him, you know.  It's crazy.  I always thought that the state-free minipads ought to do NASCAR, just for the announcing.  It's a beautiful summer's eve here.  One lap in, we already got a red flag.  The KY jelly car has just accelerated and easily slipped into the number two hole.  The Vagisil car has been itching and burning rubber all season out there, and is number  one in the bush standings.  There's Jeff Gordon, the number 24 strawberry douche Chevy Monte Carlo. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, you don't see many of those sponsorships.  You don't see them.  How'd you get tickets to the tampon 200?  Well, we pulled some strings.  We got some seats.  But, yeah, I'm a big NASCAR fan.  A guy said to me one time, NASCAR ain't nothing but a bunch of mullet-headed rednecks drinking  bush beer all day, watching cars go around in a circle.  And I was like, you know what?  It's a lot more than that, buddy.  All right?  We also got Budweiser.  So he was way off. 
[03:09:00]  I used to watch years ago when it was like Earnhardt and, who the hell else, Waltrip used  to be every year just banging heads with each other, and that was entertaining.  You know, I used to watch that.  But then I kind of got out of it when a lot of the old-timers retired.  Yeah, I was always a Dick Trickle fan.  Dick Trickle, yeah.  Yeah, he was my favorite.  I always got a little chuckle when they had to say his name.  Love Trickle.  I always had a sticker on my truck that said, Racing Makes My Dick Trickle.  Yeah, he was awesome.  But, you know, he won one race.  And he's from Wisconsin. 
[03:09:30]  He's from the La Crosse area.  That's where my cousins live.  So they got that big.  He's La Crosse, you know.  And he got interviewed after the race.  And now I know why they never did interviews with Dick Trickle.  Oh, really?  This is basically the whole interview.  Dick, I finally got you a NASCAR win.  What do you think?  Well, I tell you, I'm coming around, you know, and my wife's over, and I go, I know what  he's coming around the side, you know what I mean?  I'm not kidding.  It was like that.  I'd like to hear him and Ward Burton in a conversation one time.  You know, hey, where are you?  What are you doing?  I don't know. 
[03:10:00]  You know, Ward Burton, he's one of them guys who don't move his lips when he talks, you  know.  Very good.  Yeah, I'm a big racing fan.  Who's Ward Burton?  Is he a racer?  He's a racer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Danny in Jersey.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hi, fella.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi.  Hey, I wanted to say, you know what NASCAR stands for?  What?  Non-accepted sports centered around rednecks.  Punch it out, Maverick.  Kick your ass, son, dude.  And we'll all shove a milk bone down your throat and stick a hungry dog up your ass. 
[03:10:30]  Let's go to Chattanooga.  Cooper.  Chattanoogie.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Oh, not too bad.  Hey, Larry Cable guy, man.  You got the guy down there, you ever seen him with a coon dick toothpick?  Now that, I will say, I do not know what a coon dick is.  Coon dick toothpick.  A coon dick toothpick.  I used to work with a guy from Lynchburg, and he carried it.  He hooked it on the end of his key chain.  It was a bone that's in a raccoon's dick, and I swear to God, this fucker picked his teeth  with it. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, a raccoon.  I misunderstood that.  They actually have bones in their penis, yeah.  I've heard that.  All right, Jimmy the Greek.  Raccoons are bred, so their cocks can be used as canes.  You know, they got a bone in their penis.  They do.  Jeepers.  That's a nice story.  You're talking about the raccoons.  That's a wonderful story.  Fantastic.  How about that? 
[03:11:30]  I was down in Texas not long ago, and they're having, they can call up if I'm wrong, but  they were trying to get rid of the phrase, remember the Alamo.  Really?  Out of the Texas school.  Isn't this ridiculous?  Out of the Texas school system.  Now, why?  What was their reason?  They said it's offensive to Mexicans.  Remember the Alamo.  And I'm thinking to myself, didn't they win that war?  I think they kicked some ass there.  Yeah, you would think the offensive phrase would be, remember the ass kicking the Mexicans  got after the Alamo would be the offensive phrase. 
[03:12:00]  You'd think they'd run around saying, remember the Alamo all the time.  They kicked ass.  That was the win.  That's the first thing they won since they knocked Puerto Rico out of the Olympics in  soccer three years ago.  I mean, good God.  They want to keep that phrase.  What else can't you do now in school?  You can't say God in anything.  I'm not a religious guy, but it's like they want to remove God from any of the, like you  could talk about certain things in class, but you can't talk about certain parts of the  Constitution or the Bill of Rights that have God in it.  That have God in it.  Yeah, I heard that the other day.  God, the left is so irritating.  They really are irritating. 
[03:12:30]  It's like Meathead from all in the family.  That's who's running, you know, the country.  Meathead.  Rob Ryan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  And he's like that in real life, too.  He's the one that started the whole non-smoking thing in L.A.  He loves being called Meathead, too.  Yeah, I'm sure.  All the work he's done afterwards.  Hey, Meathead.  Yeah.  We have the Meathead thing.  We got to play that going on.  How hard you work, you're still just a Polack sidekick to us, stupid.  We got to get the retard to making Meathead sing the song all uncomfortable.  Well, you know, if I always say, if more people stood up and said enough is enough, that 
[03:13:00]  shit would stop happening.  But everybody's scared to say anything.  People are scared to say stuff, or they just live their lives.  People have lives to lead.  They have jobs to go to.  They're not like the Hollywood elite that has plenty of time to do all this stuff that  they find the time to do, bitching about everything and deciding how we should all lead our lives.  Yeah, but the people going to work nine to five with three or four kids, you know, they  don't have a say in it. 
[03:13:30]  Because, yeah, they don't have the time to sit there and write the letters.  And they don't have a TV show to go on and spout the crap that you hear coming out of  these people.  I think it's ridiculous.  Pat Sajak actually wrote an article.  Oh, I read that one.  It's about Hollywood and how disgustingly, you know, agenda-obsessed they are.  And it's about the Dutch filmmaker who was killed for offending Muslims.  Can you imagine in this country if a filmmaker was killed over something he did on abortion?  If an anti-abortion activist shot him and killed him, the outrage from Hollywood, but 
[03:14:00]  because it involves Islam, they don't say anything.  And this is one of their own who was killed.  And Pat Sajak, I can't believe I'm saying, and Pat Sajak was saying.  Yeah, whenever you point him out as a poignant source.  I know.  I was disgusted to read it.  I had to keep going to the top of the article knowing, Pat Sajak, the Wheel of Fortune  guy?  Because he was making complete sense.  And he was talking about that and how this guy, this filmmaker, was killed because he  did a film about Muslims and how they treat their women.  Abused them, yeah.  And some guy, you know, killed him and left a note, stabbed into his chest, slit the guy's 
[03:14:30]  throat.  I mean, really worked him over.  That guy was trying to send a message.  You think so?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to read much into it.  You know?  What are you, a psychiatrist over there?  You can figure these people out, can't you?  But if it happened over abortion, you can bet every fucking liberal Hollywood  filmmaker would be screaming about it in the press.  But because it's Islam, and they don't want to be seen like they're agreeing with George  Bush on anything.  That was the point he brought up.  He goes, who wouldn't be outraged at this?  They don't want to say anything, not because they're not outraged by it, but because they 
[03:15:00]  don't want to align themselves with the president or his policy on Iraq or anything.  And it wouldn't be.  Of course not.  It's just, you know, a filmmaker was killed because of a film he made.  You know, let that outrage you.  Don't be so scared that people are going to go, oh, you're knocking Islam and Muslims.  You must be aligned with President Bush.  No.  But they are such pussies over there.  Yeah, they totally are.  And that's the thing. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, it's unbelievable.  You can make, that's the point I always make.  You can make fun of born-again Christians in Hollywood as much as you want, but it wasn't  Baptist preachers flying planes in the buildings, right?  You make fun of a Muslim, oh, you're an asshole, you're a bigot, but oh, go ahead and make  fun of anybody else, but don't make fun of them.  They're the ones flying a damn plane.  Oh, but it's not all of them.  I can never figure that out.  Yeah.  Or it's not all of them.  It's all of them I've seen.  Yeah, exactly.  Calling out a great line of tough crowd, they're talking about Islam.  He goes, look, you can't let a few million bad apples spoil the bunch. 
[03:16:00]  That's a good one.  All right, maybe later.  Yeah, it's totally insane.  I mean, and that's why I like getting on stage and trying to encourage just regular folks,  hey, if people started speaking up and say, hey, enough of this bullshit, it'd stop, you  know, especially in that schools, taking God, people wouldn't want that to happen, but they  don't say nothing.  And you're exactly right, because they ain't got time to say something about it. 
[03:16:30]  They don't have time.  People are busy.  They're trying to live their lives.  They're not writing things and protesting and getting out.  It's the people that have no life or this elite Hollywood that, from their gated houses,  think they know exactly what the common man is thinking and what they should be doing  and how they should treat other people.  And they know nothing.  You ever go on to Barbara Streisand's webpage and read her words of wisdom she writes every  week or every month or so?  I read this, and it's, I swear to God, it's like watching Mars Attacks. 
[03:17:00]  Those, ah, ah, ah.  They made more sense than reading this Barbara Streisand.  We should get that and read it on the air.  Oh, we should.  Absolutely.  She's an irrelevant, elitist bag of meat.  She's done nothing good since nuts.  That's the last good project she was involved with, when she played a hooker, which is exactly  what she should be doing.  Jabbing that fucking awful Flintstones record player nose into your stomach while she sucks  a cock.  A liberal whore.  God, she makes me nauseous.  My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. 
[03:17:30]  I agree with Jimmy Norton on that.  Flintstones record player.  Well, they caught her out there.  She knows.  They caught her out there talking about, she was talking about how saving energy or something  in her apartment, even when she's out of the country, have to be air conditioned to like  60 degrees, and then her spokesman actually said, well, Barbara, that applies to other  people, but not her.  They actually came out and said that because the inconsistency had been caught.  And the ones that hop on the bandwagon for PETA, that terrorist organization that tries  to save animals. 
[03:18:00]  They're awful.  They hop on the bandwagon about how bad it is, and you won't catch them without their  leather boots on.  Right.  Why is leather okay, then?  How about if you're going to tell people they can't eat meat and throw paint on fur coats,  how about you don't wear anything that has anything to do with an animal?  You'll look like shit every day.  Your makeup, everything.  I agree, and I'll tell you something else.  That's why they take a tour bus everywhere, because I'm not putting up with that crap  at the airport anymore. 
[03:18:30]  I mean, until they start, what do you call it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Profiling.  Profiling.  Absolutely.  And that's what they do in Israel.  They profile.  But we can't do it here, because we're going to hurt somebody's feelings.  I'm sick and tired of waiting.  Now you've got to take your jacket off.  You've got to take this off.  I went through the other day to save time.  I went through and nothing but a pair of speedos.  And they still pulled me out of the line and accused me of smuggling in a pocket knife. 
[03:19:00]  Believe that?  No, we're giving it to Paul.  But they will let X amount.  They will only have a certain amount of guys.  If they see 10 Arabic guys going through, and obviously not all Arabic guys are terrorists,  but if you were to look at an 80-year-old lady, why?  You're wasting time and resources checking over old women from the South, kids, things  like that.  And then, yeah, if you see some Arab gentlemen, some Middle Eastern gentlemen come by, check  them.  Why?  Look at the past record. 
[03:19:30]  You could pretty much tell who the guys are that might be pulling some shenanigans on  airplanes.  I remember I was flying, like the day you could fly after 9-11, and I'm going to Houston,  Texas.  All right?  I got my buckle on.  I'm going down there at the rodeo down there.  And I got my buckle on.  I got my cowboy hat.  And there's another dude going down there, too.  He's about four behind me.  And they were going out of their way, so they wouldn't offend these folks.  Don't offend.  And there was four Middle Eastern dudes, all in the age of 25 to 30. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, the real American hating age bracket.  Couldn't speak only, with carry-ons, right on the plane.  And they pulled me and the other dude out of the line to search us.  And I got in trouble.  I go, this is bullshit.  And, of course, what's the realest problem here?  And I said, you just led four Middle Eastern dudes on the plane with carry-ons, and you're  going to pull us out of the line, dressed like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid?  And you're going to let them?  I go, this is ridiculous.  Well, it's just random.  Bullshit.  Random.  It's random.  Well, don't make it random. 
[03:20:30]  But people are so afraid of offending.  Like you said, don't offend.  How about we start offending a little bit?  When you're looking for mobsters, do you talk to Jews or blacks?  No, you look for Italians.  When you want the Westies, you look for Irish in Hell's Kitchen.  It's like, that's who you're looking for right now.  Sorry.  We're not the ones that told you to fucking hijack planes.  It's now called Clinton.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  It is actually much nicer.  Well, no.  They just don't like the name Hell's Kitchen anymore.  Well, I like...  It doesn't help the real estate.  And it's only in America that they're having problems with Islam.  I mean, it's not every other little corner of the world. 
[03:21:00]  You know, every piece of it or else.  It's not in India or, you know, anywhere else.  It's only 98% of every problem ever happening in the world.  It's them.  Yeah, you know, the Czechians.  They're not Arab.  It's just...  It's a religion.  It's violent.  Sorry.  Right.  Sorry.  Are they having problems with the North Pole yet?  Reach there yet with their terrorism?  It'll hit there sooner or later.  Eskimos.  Them sumbitches.  Get rid of them.  Take your head, Stu.  All right.  We should get Larry out of here.  You got things to do, Larry.  Larry, thank you so much. 
[03:21:30]  Did you have fun?  I love y'all.  I've heard about you for a long time.  And listening to you on XJ.  Yeah, we got a bad rap.  It was nice to have...  You know what?  We did get a bad rap.  Yeah.  A few stupid DJs ruin it for everybody with their terrorist acts.  Yeah, no, I hear you.  Yeah.  It's insane.  But no, I appreciate y'all.  I mean, I had a great time.  Great.  It was good to see old Jimmy Norton.  Thank you, Tom.  Always is.  Cool.  And this is, before you go, the thing I love about these guys is that the industry never  would have given you guys anything, because you're not what they're looking...  You know how they look for these fucking elitist, unfunny comics, but their following 
[03:22:00]  got so big that they couldn't ignore them anymore.  And then they had to, yeah.  They couldn't ignore you guys, and now you've got a hit show.  It's fucking great, man.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, and that's a tribute to the fans, and you know, we just got great fans.  Everywhere I go, I always thank the fans, you know, because if it wasn't for them, we  wouldn't be able to do what we do.  But the truckers out there listening, I love y'all to death, and thanks for having me on.  Open and Anthony, kick ass, by God.  All right.  Lotsworthy roast tonight.  Queer or not, y'all good folks.  I'll tell you.  You insane.  You insane. 
[03:22:30]  He has no idea.  We've been trying to get the gay out of this show for the last three weeks, and he just  ruined it with that.  You ass.  Oh, sorry.  Jimmy tends to bring some gay in.  We're going to have hot chicks here Friday, and we're going to be throwing darts at their  a-holes.  Oh, damn.  Are you serious?  Yeah, come back Friday.  You know what?  Let me...  Pencil that in.  Let me get a schedule.  What else do you want us to plug here?  You've got the Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rise Again DVD coming out December 7th.  The show's on the WB Friday nights at 930.  Anything else?  That's pretty much it. 
[03:23:00]  We have just that DVD.  The CD's out now.  The Blue Collar CD's out now.  I have a Larry the Cable Guy Get Her Done DVD.  Get Her Done.  And you can get my Get Her Done shirts at Walmart, JCPenney, and Bass Pro Shops.  LarryTheCableGuy.com.  Big seller's there.  You can get some on there.  All right, let's get them out of here.  It's Larry the Cable Guy.  And as we go to break, in honor of the next 20 minutes, a nice little song from Team America.  America, fuck yeah.  Ah, there you go.  Get Her Done. 
[03:23:30]  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  Come in and get to save the motherfucking day, yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way, yeah.  Terrorists, your game is blue.  Cause now you have to answer to America.  Fuck yeah.  Flick my butt and suck on my bone. 
[03:24:00]  America, fuck yeah.  What you gonna do when we come for you now?  It's the dream that we all share.  It's the heart of hearts and love.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Walmart.  Fuck yeah.  The Gap.  Fuck yeah.  Baseball.  Fuck yeah.  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.  Fuck yeah.  Internet.  Fuck yeah.  Slavery.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Starbucks.  Fuck yeah.  Disney World.  Fuck yeah.  Pornos.  Fuck yeah.  Valium.  Fuck yeah.  Reeboks.  Fuck yeah.  Fake tits.  Fuck yeah.  Sushi.  Fuck yeah.  Taco Bell.  Fuck yeah.  Rodeo.  Fuck yeah.  Fat Bath and Beyond.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Liberty.  Fuck yeah.  White slips. 
[03:25:00]  Fuck yeah.  Teatumos.  Fuck yeah.  Band-Aids.  Fuck yeah.  Las Vegas.  Fuck yeah.  Christmas.  Fuck yeah.  Immigrant.  Fuck yeah.  Popeye.  Fuck yeah.  Democrats.  Fuck yeah.  Republicans.  Fuck yeah.  Sporking shit.  Books.  I was walking down the street and some construction guy was shouting at me. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please wow responsibly.

[03:27:00]  Fifty years.  Did you start when you were one?  Did you have like a cigarette mobile over your crib?  Time to go change the baby's ashtray.  You look great. 
[03:27:30]  You feel okay?  Die tomorrow.  Die tomorrow.  Die tomorrow.  Well, you've got about 30 minutes.  Thanks for spending it with me.  You ever try and quit?  See, I love that.  Every smoker.  You ever try and quit?  Mm-hmm.  I'm trying right now, believe it or not.  You may find it's hard to believe, but...  Did you try cold turkey?  That's the hardest.  Yeah.  You've got to quit gradually.  That's what I'm going to do.  Quit gradually. 
[03:28:00]  What I'm going to do is, I'm going to lose one lung.  A little while later, I'm going to lose the other one.  And that's it.  I've got a plan.  Dude, can I bum one cigarette from you, man?  I'm trying to quit buying.  Thank you, sir.  Fifty years of smoking.  You're giving me fucking hope.  I was going to quit until I saw you. 
[03:28:30]  Fuck it.  I saw this documentary recently on whales.  This guy has dedicated his life to telling you what the whales are saying.  Wow.  I don't know how you'd argue with him when he turns in his report.  And he just throws it down there.  Well, here's what the whales are saying.  Okay, thanks, Charlie.  He's looking back.  Here's what the whales are saying.  Yeah, Charlie figured it out. 
[03:29:00]  They show how he does it.  He's out on a ship.  He's got a pencil.  And he deciphers the whale noises as he hears them.  You know, he'll hear like...  You know, he's like going, oh, okay.  Oh. 
[03:29:30]  He's lonely.  He's lonely.  No, you're lonely.  I'd like to do that for like two weeks  and then turn around  and find out that the door's squeaking behind you.  I've got stupid in stereo.  The OPNM show. 
[03:30:00]  Ah, what a fun day, huh?  Ah, yeah.  I want to thank Larry the Cable Guy  for stopping on by.  Helping out the program.  I got to go get my hair did after the show.  You're getting your hair did?  I haven't had a haircut in so long.  I can't stop wearing...  You know, I have to put the hat on all the time  because it's just like a...  It's like buckwheat. 
[03:30:30]  If I don't...  So I got to go get my hair did.  Get the shampoo thing.  You're going to shampoo your hair, huh?  Well, it's all...  Yeah.  It's uncomfortable  because I'm not sure at any given moment.  I'd say nine times out of ten,  I get the chick.  One time out of ten,  the guy comes over.  Cuts the hair or...  I'm going to wash your hair.  No, this shampoo guy.  I don't care if a guy cuts my hair.  The washing of the hair...  Washing the hair, I don't like.  You know me. 
[03:31:00]  I don't like male-to-male contact  in any way, shape, or form.  And there he is,  like the massage on the scalp.  When a girl does that,  when she's washing your hair,  it's so nice.  It's like...  Very nice, yes.  Ah, you lay back to warm water.  Her fingers are going like behind your ear  and kind of...  But when a guy's doing it,  I am so tense and tight.  I'm like,  ah, when is this over again?  It's like a prison rape.  You just...  Oh, and...  Oh, just stop.  Why don't you say something  and just tell him...  Because I don't want to offend. 
[03:31:30]  See?  But it's just a hair washing.  That's not like...  No, no, no.  I know exactly what he's talking about.  It ruins the experience.  I enjoy a woman washing my hair.  I enjoy her touching  and massaging the scalp.  You can completely relax.  When a guy's doing it,  I'm so uptight and tense  and sweating,  and I'm just...  Get off of me.  I know.  And your head is all the way back  in perfect position for him  if you want to...  Monster rinse.  Oh, no.  Monster rinse. 
[03:32:00]  Your hand is actually  on the end of the chair  and his mule presses against it.  You know something?  When a woman's washing your hair  and she bends over,  you get the boob thing.  Everyone knows that.  When a guy is doing it,  yeah,  if he rubs up against you,  it's his junk  that's like right there  at the level you're laying at.  So you've got to give us  a full report tomorrow.  I'll let you know,  but like I said,  nine times out of ten,  it's the girl.  But occasionally,  and now that I'm talking about it,  I'm sure today...  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, yeah,  still John Sahag. 
[03:32:30]  Yes.  What?  Hot chicks.  Hot chicks.  Girls that work there  are ridiculous.  I know.  Ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  It's like...  You go to a fancy joint.  I go to the fancy place  because I don't get haircuts a lot.  How often do you go?  Like once every two months?  Not once a month?  Once every two,  sometimes three months.  Okay.  Dude, it's like going over.  It's a whole experience  going to John Sahag.  They have tea and coffee.  It's like beverages and stuff.  It's like,  yes, I'll have some club soda  and lime, please.  I get it.  Trust me.  But see,  that's all I'm saying.  I'm the only one 
[03:33:00]  in this whole freaking area  that remembers the old Anthony.  The impoverished Anthony.  The impoverished Anthony  that had an afro  that honestly,  on a good day,  could have easily  went out of foot.  It was...  Yeah, that was for my band.  You weren't getting  your hair cut ever.  Is this an expensive place  that he's going to?  Yeah.  This is a very fancy place.  Yeah, how much  for the haircut today?  One of the little things  I treat myself to.  Little amenities.  One of his little pleasures  in life.  How much is your haircut  going to cost?  If you figure it  as once every three months.  Okay.  How often? 
[03:33:30]  Let me ask you  how often you are here.  I have to give...  Probably once every five weeks.  I think it's every two weeks.  No, it really isn't.  I get to go.  I got to get an haircut.  No, it really isn't.  It's about once a month,  once every five.  Yeah.  So how much  is it going to cost?  It's $130.  Wow.  But it's once  every three months.  Do some math.  How much do you pay?  How much do you pay?  Honestly, it's like  55, I think.  See?  So it's about the same. 
[03:34:00]  It works out about the same,  but in one clip, I know.  Yeah, but what Anthony's  making up in differences  is like supermodels  walking around,  and it's, you know...  Not the one who'll be  washing his scalp today.  It's going to be  some bisexual...  John Tahog walks around  like a rock star  in the place.  Like Mick Jagger  walking around.  It's a nice atmosphere,  the whole place.  It's like very cool atmosphere,  like a club.  You should see  my haircut atmosphere.  It's me on my hands  and knees  with my head  over a tub  doing my own hair  with stupid,  like little paper towels  lined so I can just  take the hair  out of the tub  and throw it out. 
[03:34:30]  That's my haircut experience.  Smelling my own tub ring.  Why don't you just  get the razor out  and...  Yeah, like opening  a full metal jacket  in a weird way.  Hey, you guys,  we were mentioning  Rob Reiner.  Yes.  And I was trying  to get the  How's Your News clip.  Yeah.  The retards  that do the news,  I guess.  Uh-huh.  When's the next  How's Your News special  coming out?  We'll find out,  whatever,  because we can't  get enough of this.  And one of the retards  sang with Rob Reiner.  Yes.  The old  All in the Family  theme song.  Theme song,  and I just want 
[03:35:00]  to play it real fast.  It's like 30 seconds.  Listen how uncomfortable  Rob Reiner is  and how he has to be nice  because it's so wrong  to be mean to these people.  Yeah, if it was  a normal person,  quote,  he'd be gone.  Wouldn't he be like,  no, thank you.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing  the meathead  All in the Family.  And of course,  we need to sing  that theme song.  And today,  Boy, the way,  Glenn Miller played.  Song,  the way,  the head pirate.  Guys,  I like we had it,  men. 
[03:35:30]  Stones were the days.  And you know  what you were then.  Girls were girls  and men were men.  Mister,  we can use  a Democratic Party  like Kerry again.  Oh,  first of all,  Kerry's a candidate,  retard.  Not a party.  It's a retard.  And it's a Democratic Party,  stupid.  He is,  give him a little slack.  He stinks.  I don't like the fact  that he called him  a meathead  and a bunch of other  retards laughed at him.  That must have made  Rob Reiner's  liberal blood boil. 
[03:36:00]  That's right,  you smarmy idiot.  A bunch of retards  are chuckling at you.  Retards laugh at you.  Yeah,  they're big dirty fingers  pointing and chuckling.  First laugh they've had  in years.  Fat tongues going,  ha, ha, ha.  Yeah,  ha, ha.  The only time  they don't know  to laugh  is when someone's  behind them  kind of like  massaging their penis  inappropriately.  They think that's a joke.  George from DC  writes on the Instant Feedback,  Ben finishes every one  of his sentences  with either ridiculous,  nuts, or insane.  No matter what he says, 
[03:36:30]  it always goes like this,  blah, blah, blah,  nuts, blah, blah, blah,  ridiculous.  Something just to keep in mind  as we move forward  with the show.  That's a good point, Ben.  Everyone has their crutch.  That's insane.  That's insane.  That's nuts.  At least you're not  giggling as much.  I don't mind Ben's giggle.  I think it's charming  in a weird way.  Alex is saying,  you fucking fags,  a haircut should cost  $20 or less.  Good point, Alex.  For $130,  it better come  with a lower haircut  and a happy ending.  Yeah, but where's he  writing from?  What part of the country?  What does it matter?  Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
[03:37:00]  Okay.  No, no, no, no.  In New York,  everything's way more expensive.  But not that.  What's a haircut  in Allentown?  I mean, you know,  $10?  So you're saying  it's $13?  At the Lemon Tree, probably.  $13 times the expense.  No, that's not  a directly proportionate ratio.  Hey, the next  How's Your News  is going to be  in a few days.  The 5th of December.  8 o'clock.  What channel?  The Trio.  We're going to be  taping that, right?  Yes, we will be.  I think we're doing  a follow-up special  aimed at those kids' parents  called How's Your DNA?  Let's say hi to Popeye 
[03:37:30]  in Texas.  Popeye.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  What's up,  how are you?  How are you?  How's it going,  sweet britches?  Hi, how are you,  cuddles?  Hey, I just want to say  No, all truck drivers  are lonely and long-winded.  Catch me later, boys.  I'm out of here.  Oh, shit.  Quick.  Nice.  See, that's how a trucker  should call the show.  Let's see.  Oh, this is funny.  Matt in Jersey.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, I was out in Arizona  with my girlfriend  and I screwed up my back  so she decided to take me  to the spot  for like a massage.  The massage guy  was named Chris. 
[03:38:00]  And as soon as I found out  it was a guy,  I fell out of the suite  and just ran with the towel  on my waist.  My girlfriend  wouldn't talk to me  because they still  made me do the money  for the massage.  Why would you want  a massage from a guy  if you're a guy?  I disagree.  Wait, why do you disagree?  Because it's a massage,  if you're getting a massage,  it really, I mean, look,  I'm a complete piece of garbage,  but most people,  massage is not a sexual thing.  It's like most sports massages.  I'm still saying,  I'm not looking at it  as a sexual thing.  Yeah, I can't.  I really not.  But if a woman  does a massage to me, 
[03:38:30]  there's no way,  I'm such an addict,  I can't look at it sexually.  Oh, I got you.  Do you understand  what I mean?  Like if a guy,  if an older guy,  a 50-year-old guy  is doing it,  then you're just  getting your muscles done.  No way, I can't.  I get massages  and they always ask,  you know,  man or woman,  I'm always woman.  I would too.  Because I can't relax  if a guy's touching me.  I cannot relax.  Even if it's not a sex thing,  I can't relax.  But if a woman is doing it,  it's going to be a sex thing.  I'm incapable.  It's like having a drink  in front of an alcoholic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If a girl's massaging you, 
[03:39:00]  you're thinking  at least rolling over  and having her touch you.  Oh my, yeah, absolutely, man.  Tickle the old taint.  I want to go to a spa.  I've never been to a spa  and had like the stuff put on me.  I'm going to try that one time.  Try to be a normal person.  Since I'm not wasting  my money on whores,  I'm going to be  a nice normal guy.  Now you got enough  for a $130 haircut.  And one of my gals  called me last night  and I didn't ask her  to come over.  I was very proud of myself.  Oh, she did call you though.  One of them did.  She's like,  I haven't heard of you.  Yeah, she's probably  fucking starving  with you off the horse.  Absolutely.  Please, Jimmy,  one blowjob. 
[03:39:30]  The prostitute union  has been calling me going,  look, if the rates  have been too high,  we'll...  The stock is crashing  on hookers.  I hate these underwear.  My fucking mule pops out.  I'm so...  I'm not even trying  to be dirty.  It's just gross.  Just wants to come out  and say hi.  Yeah.  All right, well,  did we do everything today?  Maybe we could get out early.  No!  A lot of stuff.  Can we end class early?  People aren't paying  $2 a month to hear us do.  Dude, they got their  seven cents today.  I don't care.  They got their seven cents.  That is seven cents. 
[03:40:00]  Seven cents a day.  That's all you should ask for  from this program.  One joke.  One Larry the Cable Guy joke  was the seven cents today.  Right.  True.  Seven cents.  So they did get  their money's worth.  You're right.  We didn't get to the Imus story.  Our old pal.  What's going on with Imus?  Some nanny suing?  He's being sued.  I love him.  I'm being sued.  We loved on Imus.  I'm a old cunt.  Used to work for me.  He's a huge supporter of us.  Of ours.  Yes, he is. 
[03:40:30]  He actually took Opie  under his wing.  He did.  He doesn't call as much lately.  Has he called you?  Not lately.  He was calling right up  until we started the gig.  Well, now you're competing.  He was very concerned  that Anthony and I  weren't going to land  on our feet.  Yeah.  So he made us  have one more meeting  with Farid.  That was Imus  that initiated that.  Thanks, Don.  He was a little worried  about the satellite radio.  He was like,  before you sign the deal  you've got to meet with Farid  one more time.  I need you guys to meet  with this hostile Arab. 
[03:41:00]  Oh.  That was not a fun meeting.  And then our old pal Farid  when we decided  not to go back  to commercial radio  trashes us.  Trashes us in the news.  That's what you get  from an old pal.  We just went for the money  and we should have gone  to his radio stations  in I don't even know where.  Very small towns  all over America.  Yeah.  That's what he wanted us to do.  I had to go to Reno.  The fact is  we could have made more money  going back to commercial radio  but we wouldn't have  had as much fun.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  But he said we went  for the money.  No, we did not.  We could have syndicated  the show ourselves  and made a lot of money.  A lot.  And they were lining up.  They were lining up.  I'll be Don Imus  on the phone.  I need you to meet  with Fareed.  Don't go for the money.  Just go for my Donkey Kong, baby.  Moby Worm coming to get you.  Now I'm doing the 70s Don Imus  before I put on my big  fag cowboy hat  and bandana 
[03:42:00]  around my chicken neck, baby.  I fired my nanny.  She was packing heat.  Yeah, can I read  this story a little bit?  Yeah, I get this story  because it's really  That's a great Imus,  by the way.  It's odd.  Well, thank you, Jimmy.  He loves the Imus  impersonation, by the way.  Oh.  Imus, he could take a joke.  And also does a great Howard,  but Howard's such a pussy  and a crybaby  that he made  He got Mel to tell  Ant to stop doing Howard.  Quack, quack.  You do just a fantastic  Imus look.  Thank you.  Well, Imus has a sense  of humor.  He could take it. 
[03:42:30]  I know.  I just meant to tell  that to Ant publicly.  A New York woman  who briefly worked  as a nanny for Don Imus  has sued the radio host  for wrongful termination,  claiming she was canned  for bringing a harmless  cap gun and pocket knife  with her during a trip  last Thanksgiving  to the family's  sprawling New Mexico ranch.  Nicole, 24,  also claimed in her  New York State Supreme Court  lawsuit,  a copy of which  you'll find below.  Is she hot?  That she was defamed  when Imus later  announced on his program  that he had been forced  to disarm his nanny, 
[03:43:00]  whom he labeled  as dangerous  and a terrorist.  Now, come on.  You know it was a joke  on the air.  Yeah, he's doing  shtick on his show.  Imus isn't disarming  anybody physically.  No.  She's just another pig  looking to get paid.  That's all she is.  In her complaint.  She's got the same lawyer  that, what's his name?  The girl that filed  the complaint  against O'Reilly.  Oh, really?  Same lawyer.  So it seems like  his thing is now  going after people  and having women  sue them.  He's my lawyer. 
[03:43:30]  He's a lawyer, too,  by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You have a lawyer?  Yeah.  Busy, busy.  Oh, yeah, we have a lawyer.  Now he's busy  with this high-profile case.  He'll get to our case.  Don't worry about it.  What case?  Huh?  Wrongful death suit  in my family?  We're trying to do  a comedy show, though.  Dude, I'm thinking  about harassment.  I'm like...  No, we hired the best.  I thought maybe  Opie was sexually assaulted  by somebody.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, but somebody  saw that blonde hair.  No, my suit doesn't  involve vibrators  and phone calls. 
[03:44:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  Anyway, our suit,  I should say.  Cool.  Inner complaint  filed yesterday  by the lawyer  who represented  the woman who recently...  And there's a blank there,  whatever that was supposed  to say,  of various improperities.  Improprieties.  I know,  but it's all messed up here.  Improperties?  Well, when it's not  completely there.  All right.  Improprieties, I know.  Improprieties.  Whatever.  Improprieties.  Impropriorities? 
[03:44:30]  As Ben would say,  improprieties, insane.  Whatever.  She brought the cap gun  with her so that she  and Imus' five-year-old son  could play cowboys  at the 4,000-acre ranch.  As for the pocket knife,  she noted that the  one-and-a-half-inch item  was never unsheathed  from a leather harness  affixed to her belt.  In her lawsuit,  she alleged that she  endured frenzied questioning  by Imus and his wife  who woke her up  at 1 a.m.  Who won the 1956 
[03:45:00]  World Series  to grill her about  the pocket knife  and the cap gun,  which she said  she did not use  nor showed to Imus' son.  Then Imus' wife said,  pack your things,  you're terminated.  She was escorted  off the property  at 4.15 a.m.  by a ranch employee  and the radio host.  Sounds like she was  a little too hot  for Don's wife  maybe to be around.  I don't know.  If you're going to  throw someone out  like that at 4 a.m.  for a cap gun  and a pocket knife,  perhaps Mrs. Imus 
[03:45:30]  was getting a little,  you know,  a little nervous.  It just goes on and on,  but that's pretty much  why she was fired.  She also is saying  that the whole time  she was there,  the only people  that were on this ranch  that were supposed  to care for cancer kids  were the Imuses  and a couple of,  like, ranch hands.  She said at no time  did she ever see  any cancer kids  or anybody else  that the ranch  is supposed to be built for. 
[03:46:00]  Well, they bring the kids there,  you know,  a few times a year,  so I don't think  they're bringing kids there  all year long.  Quick, McCord,  shave your head  and look hungry.  I'm a cowboy, baby.  All right,  we're going to go  roping cancer kids today  because I don't have  any on my ranch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on, stupid.  Everybody,  put on a big,  fag cowboy hat. 
[03:46:30]  I had to wear  a 10-gallon hat  when I fell off that horse  because I had to put  my oxygen tank  underneath the hat  and put the oxygen mask  on my face.  Remember when I fell off  the horse  and punctured my lung?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, stupid.  He got hurt, didn't he?  Yeah.  Oh, he got hurt?  He almost died.  He almost died.  He had a punctured lung  and he was on the air  a couple of weeks later 
[03:47:00]  with this huge oxygen tank  and the thing that you wear  in your nose  when you're taking oxygen  and it was like  a little nasal  but he's trying to do  his show.  Don Imus,  Imus of the Morning Program  at 6.05.  Quack, quack.  And I'm having  a near-death experience  right now  with my oxygen tank on  and my big,  fag cowboy hat  and the bandana  keeps the skin  from knocking me  in the balls  from my neck. 
[03:47:30]  See, because it's  really hanging.  We figured that out.  It's an exaggeration joke.  Stupid.  He says pogram.  He doesn't say,  that's why I love him.  Imus of the Morning pogram.  Pogram.  Pogram.  He does Imus of the Morning pogram.  Yeah, the pogram  is put on  by this  cast of characters.  So there you go.  Another woman  suing  a personality.  He didn't get the banger.  Trying to get some cash. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Trying to get some cash  because she was fired.  Pretty much.  She's hot as life too, man.  Look at her.  Oh, I know.  George, what's going on?  Weird massage moment  and back to school.  Dangerfield's lying  on his back.  He's going,  oh yeah,  oh you got it.  Oh, he's moaning  and groaning.  They pan the camera down  and you see  Paulie's man hands  all over him.  Ugh!  I do remember that.  That was a good movie too.  Yeah.  Call me when you have no class. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, George.  Sally Kellerman,  she's dead now  but she was great.  Oh no, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking of  Metal Econ.  No, she didn't die.  Metal Econ.  Okay, you scared me.  Rick from Toronto.  Why did I scare you?  I don't know.  That's just a thing to say there.  I'm having dinner with her.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell her,  but she's in the original MASH.  How did it happen?  I was looking forward  to listening to some poetry.  Rick, what's up?  God love us.  What's up, Rick?  Hey boys.  I learned today  that when  almost 80 of guests  show up  that the wacky horn  disappears 
[03:49:00]  and Don and Mike  come in.  Not at all, man.  He was,  Larry the cable guy  was funny.  Oh, there were times  where I thank God  for Jimmy Norton  because he bailed us out.  These were pathetic.  Dude, I actually,  I like Larry, man.  I've always liked him.  I mean, he had wonderful.  We're honest on the show.  I thought he was really funny.  I don't care how famous he is,  he's funny.  Well, set him up  and knock him down, boys.  Let's hear another  set-up joke  for the guests.  My God.  He was doing,  no one set anything up.  That's what he does  on the radio  and he's good at it.  Yeah, no, 
[03:49:30]  those were funny jokes.  You know,  some people will love it.  Some people will hate it.  They were kind of silly  and wacky  and I enjoyed his jokes today.  They were funny.  Yeah, we knew  what we were getting.  I thought it was really good.  Yes.  What's up, Rich?  That guy was insane.  Nuts.  Rich.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Crazy.  Rich.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  I learned that  Larry's jokes  were only worth  seven cents.  Yeah.  Seven cents a day.  Yeah.  If you get seven cents  a day out of this program, 
[03:50:00]  you've gotten  your money's worth.  That's all we ask  every day  that you got  seven cents  out of the program.  Amazing Grace.  That stupid commercial  that comes on  late at night.  What for?  For the Christian's  Children's Fund  where you got to pay  whatever it is,  38 cents.  You know where  they show the kids?  Oh, they show them  and there's still pictures  and they go through  a whole montage  of starving kids  with flies on their face  and they play that.  And for some reason,  that commercial's  louder than anything else.  So I can be asleep  and I'm like laying in bed  and the TV is just, 
[03:50:30]  you know,  back right after these words.  Amazing Grace,  how sweet,  you can save these kids.  I wake up.  Now I'm pissed at the kids.  Now I'm looking at the TV  and they've angered me  at these children,  at the starving children.  Because the song  is not appropriate.  It's like you're watching  the commercial  and you're like,  geez,  am I going to turn  the volume off  to jerk off? 
[03:51:00]  Always inappropriate, Jim.  Good man.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  Nothing.  Let's say hi to Jim in Boston.  What's up, Jim?  How you boys doing?  Good, man.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  Better now that I know  someone who has the same name  as me is on the phone.  LOL.  I learned that Wednesday  is not only  whooping about Wednesday,  but it's also Red State Day  on the O&A show.  Red State Day.  Red State Day.  All right,  maybe the Red States  enjoyed Larry the Cable Guy 
[03:51:30]  more than the Blue States.  I don't know.  I enjoyed it.  Yes, Anthony?  Chris H.  Right here in New York City  on Instant Feedback.  You can go fuck yourself.  What?  How the fuck  can Ant bitch about Streisand  being Hollywood elite  when he pays $150  for a fucking haircut?  I go once every three months.  That's right.  And that's pretty much  the only thing I do  when I go out.  I spend that much money  to go to a nice place 
[03:52:00]  to get a lousy haircut  for $150.  Tell him, Babs.  That's it, Babs.  Yeah, that puts me  in the same class  as that bitch  in her gated house  yapping  every chance she gets  about what's good  for America.  Yeah, because that's  what I do.  Chris.  What's wrong with  $150 for a haircut  every three months?  A little steep.  Figure out a year.  A little steep.  Hey, what does that cost me 
[03:52:30]  a year?  A little steep.  Nothing fancy pants.  It's not steep.  Some people go every month  and pay like  $50 to $80  every month.  A little steep.  What guys?  It's steep for a haircut  but not if you go  once every three months.  What else do you get though?  You get a little massage.  You get a little champagne.  You get a little beverage,  whatever you want.  Nice atmosphere.  It's clean.  It's not crowded.  Do you get a lap dance?  Not rushed.  No lap dance, no.  That would be great  as they're washing your hair.  You get a lap dance?  You get a changing room  so you can change out  of the shirt that you're in 
[03:53:00]  and you put on  a nice John Sahag robe.  You get a robe  with a haircut?  Of course you do.  That's what you're paying for.  The experience.  I never heard of a robe  with a haircut.  It's wonderful.  You put on a little robe.  Now you lost me.  No cell phone zone?  Now you lost me.  You're not allowed  to use cell phones.  Put the thing on your neck  and cut your hair?  No.  It's a nice robe.  You put on a robe.  They put the comb  in the blue shit  and then they...  The comb in the blue shit.  Hold on.  It's something with...  Floyd and Mayberry  you go to?  Let me just explain.  It's a thing with teeth on it 
[03:53:30]  that you run through your head.  As he looks at Ben.  Because he looks at the comb.  A comb?  What is this strange word  you speak of?  Comb.  It's insane.  All right.  Let's go to the phones  and play what did we learn  on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Let's make it quick.  Doughboy, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  I learned that bikini briefs  make my mule pop out.  Good boy.  Yes, we learned that.  Let's say hi to Rob  in Long Island  or on Long Island  or from Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, guys.  Am I allowed to say  macaroni salad on this station?  Oh, very good.  No, I'm not done yet. 
[03:54:00]  I got two things I learned.  I learned that  Norman gets his warranty done  from an expressionless alien.  Yep.  And I learned that  if there's an agent in the woods,  the only thing they should be doing  is jerking you off.  Good boy.  Very nice.  Godspeed.  It's Danny.  Danny, what's up?  From Jersey.  I learned that  a dead wife  equals a pay raise.  Dead ex-wife, yes.  There you go.  Hey, Jimmy,  do you have a closet?  Was that it?  No, he's still there.  I'm not going to help you 
[03:54:30]  trash me, stupid,  but I'm not going to answer,  yeah.  Well, why don't you  come out of it?  Exactly.  Jesus.  Hang this up.  Hang this up  and then he was going to  hang up on you.  Oh, God.  Joe Jigga from Boston  saying,  don't get so defensive, Trump.  Ass monkey.  I think it's James.  What's up, James?  Hey, I learned today  on the Open Antti show  that if you've got a celebrity  with a southern accent,  he's not a dumbass, 
[03:55:00]  but all the rest of us are.  Amen.  Check it out.  All right, very good.  Good point.  It's the Open Bill Gates show,  by the way.  Paul from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  I learned today  that getting the shampoo guy  is like going to the dentist.  What?  Going to the dentist?  He's talking about...  Ah, come on.  I'm sitting in the chair  and you get all nervous  and uncomfortable.  It's like going to the dentist.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm sorry. 
[03:55:30]  I'm a little slow today.  I got it immediately.  I'm actually really,  really tired today.  You look good, though.  Really tired.  People are saying  if you do the math  at $11.99 a month,  20 new shows a month,  it's 60 cents a day.  But no,  you're getting...  You're talking about XM.  You're getting everything.  You're getting the music,  the other talk,  the news,  everything that...  Major League Baseball,  everything else  that XM offers.  But our show  costs you $2 a month.  Oh, okay.  Seven cents a day.  You can't add in everything  price of this program. 
[03:56:00]  We give you  seven cents worth  of entertainment.  At least, Anthony.  At least.  At least.  Oh, Jacob.  Sometimes we push it  up to eight or nine cents a day.  There's been a couple  of 14 cents days.  I mean, it's crazy.  Right.  A couple days,  it's five cents,  but that's okay.  When has it been five cents, Hope?  I'd like to know when.  Well, the listeners will tell us.  Is this show  going to pay dividends to people?  I'm hoping.  We give them so much  entertainment a day  that they get a dividend check.  Jacob from D.C.,  what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  I've learned that money  has changed to Anthony. 
[03:56:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  No, that's the beauty.  Sorry, I didn't mean  to hang up on you.  If you want to call back.  That's the beauty of Anthony.  He hasn't really changed.  It's just these little things  that pop up from time to time,  but he's still the same guy  that I met 10 years ago.  One thing.  My stupid $150 haircut.  I can't enjoy what I do  once every three months?  No one should ever say.  You used to make $150 a week.  That's right.  What?  I just say no one should ever say  thanks for the haircut.  Now, here's my robe. 
[03:57:00]  It should never go  in the same sentence.  They're two separate things.  You put on a robe  for certain things.  I enjoy the robe.  That way my kinky Italian hair  doesn't get all over my sweater.  Well, they have the little things  they put on your neck  for the barber.  Yeah, just a cape.  A barber.  Yeah, a barber.  I'm a cape guy.  Mike from Jersey.  See, today I learned  that Ant bought a new house  in Long Island for Wendy.  He also learned  that most movies  are like trucker calls.  They don't know  how to make an ending.  Joe from Albany. 
[03:57:30]  I learned today  that Norton is truly reduced  to a comedic zero  when a real comedian  is in the studio.  Thanks for reading that one, Dick.  You killed me a few times today.  I wasn't letting you off the hook.  Cage from whackbag.com.  Today I learned  if you're going to trip out  on acid and buy a hot dog,  you might be a murderer.  I forgot we started with that today.  All right, we're going to figure out  this cherry dart thing  for the MiFi for Friday,  but definitely on Friday  we give away a MiFi  to a lucky listener.  And I wish that guy, by the way,  who wrote that instant feedback  had called  and we could have addressed that  on the air  instead of fucking hiding 
[03:58:00]  behind your computer screen.  What?  The guy who wrote that.  He was joking.  Oh, okay.  Dude, you can dish it out,  but you can't take it sometimes.  Not at all.  That's not true at all.  I was willing to take it.  He was joking.  I guarantee that guy was joking.  I don't know.  I didn't say he shouldn't  be allowed to do it.  I'm willing to deal with it.  Roy from Philly,  what did you learn  on the show today?  Ryan.  Oh, sorry.  I learned that  it takes me about nine years  of listening  to pay for Anthony's hair tie.  You did a lot of math, huh?  I do. 
[03:58:30]  All right, very good.  People start to punch out  sooner.  I like this.  Yes.  Bill from Connecticut, go.  Hey, I learned that  when Anthony gets to the balls,  he's full.  Yeah, that was really funny.  Larry, the cable guy.  Love that line.  Love you, Ope.  Love you, Angel.  Thanks, Boo-Boo.  Bye, Boo-Boo.  And Doug from Wisconsin.  Yeah, I'm a trucker  and I do know  how to end a phone call.  Barbara's Beak  can play records.  Yeah, that was  a very funny line, too.  I'm out. 
[03:59:00]  A lot of good lines.  Bye, Cuddles.  All right, I guess we're done.  Why?  There's more music to be played.  I said we're done.  That's true.  You are the boss.  It is over, Johnny.  It is over for today.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  We'll figure out the details  for the Cherry Dark Contest  and we'll let you know  what that is tomorrow.  Hopefully first thing  in the morning, all right?  Right.  It looks like we're going  to just invite a lot of people  to come down here and try.  Four, three,  my file.  One.  Nah, tomorrow. 
[03:59:30]  Bye-bye.  This is Larry the Cable Guy  and I'm a half-eared  and Jim Neighbors  with a wheelbarrow  full of that hose gear.  Unleash the power  of XM performance  in your home.

[04:00:30]  now through  December 31st, 2004.  Void where prohibited.  We're jealous of women sexually.  Women have that  superior endurance.  What's the biggest  difference sexually?  It's the energy levels  right after sex.  Girls get all energetic.  My girlfriend wants  to cook stuff.  She's got a cake in the oven.  She's roasting a pig  on a spit  that she killed  with her own bare hands.  You know,  she's painting the house,  raking leaves.  Meanwhile,  I'm at the hospital.  My blood pressure  is three over one.  I'm on life support systems.  The doctor's like, 
[04:01:00]  he came three times?  That means irreversible  brain damage.  Guys have no energy  after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists  don't get caught  every time.  So, officer,  how'd you up  and the suspect?  Well, he chased him  50 feet and he passed out.  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods  doing jumping jacks.  After I have sex,  my legs are like  a newborn calf.  I'm in the kitchen 
[04:01:30]  in my underwear  trying to make a sandwich.  Look out the window.  She's putting  in a built-in pool.  Yeah,  is 80 feet deep enough,  honey?  What did I shoot into you?  Cracks?  Sit down,  for crying out.  We'll have sex  tomorrow night  and clean the garage.  You know what I mean?  After a good blowjob,  I need a walker.  Only one thing 
[04:02:00]  got me out of college,  high school.  That high school  was tough  and grammar school  I couldn't spell at all.  I used to miss words  like posse.  and count.  I always left  the U out. 
[04:02:30]  Tiki gave me  a hundred,  though.  He said  it could have been worse.  One hundred channels  of crystal clear  digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Ian Anthony,  XM 202.  crushing his soul 
[04:03:00]  to the 땅  to the U.  to the iç  built.  Composite chis  to the inside  judge and  and  to the inside  of his suit.  He said  to the aboard  where he was  Thank you.
