<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts declaring their commitment to "Shit Radio," a raw and unrestrained format.  The conversation bounces from mundane topics like Cheerios and the absurdity of marshmallow guns to the impending arrival of Gallagher, whose previous visits resulted in significant studio destruction.  Plastic sheeting now protects the studio in anticipation of Gallagher's latest visit.  They excitedly discuss Gallagher's potential targets, even suggesting Gary Coleman's head.  Gary Coleman is scheduled to call in to promote a movie the hosts have completely forgotten about, leading to jokes about his potential willingness to be "smashed" by Gallagher.  Anthony’s possible "breakup sex" with his ex-girlfriend, "the traffic girl" Jill, is discussed at length, with the hosts playfully teasing him.  Club Soda Kenny arrives in studio, sharing hilarious stories: a disastrous first massage experience marked by discomfort, unintentional nose-dripping, and the masseuse's avoidance of his genitals; and a humorous anecdote about his colonoscopy, focusing on the ill-fitting gown.  The hosts then rant about the exorbitant cost of cable television, particularly the fees for on-demand Christmas movies and cable companies' pricing practices.  A Comcast employee calls in to offer some context regarding the cable company-network fee disputes.  The segment concludes with a discussion of streaming services as a cable alternative.

The next segment dives into the world of reality TV, specifically shows featuring teen mothers and child beauty pageants. Opie and Anthony use highly offensive language ("white trash," "pieces of shit") to describe the participants. They play a graphic song from a child beauty pageant host ("Little Miss Perfect") with sexually explicit lyrics about children, followed by other offensive songs from a past contest.  Caller Junior shares a story of his sister's exploitation in child beauty pageants and her subsequent drug use. The segment also features discussion of upcoming guests: R. Kelly, Gary Coleman (who calls in with technical difficulties), and Gallagher (whose presence is implied by the studio’s plastic sheeting). A racist Australian KFC commercial and a Popeyes chicken shortage, fueled by an aggressive marketing campaign, are heavily criticized, with the hosts focusing on the racial dynamics involved. They end with a half-formed idea for a social experiment in Times Square involving a bucket of chicken.

The following segment begins with Mike from Jersey recounting a prank involving free chicken in New Orleans, leading to a large number of Black people taking the chicken.  They then struggle with a call from Gary Coleman due to significant interference.  A news story about a woman assaulting McDonald's employees over a bad burger is briefly discussed. Lydia from Oceanside calls in with a positive G-spot story, accompanied by audio of a previous show's sexual encounter. Bob Kelly joins in-studio, with a phone call from Gallagher waiting outside.  The conversation revolves around Kelly's upcoming shows at the Gotham Comedy Club, ticket giveaways, and his aversion to bed and breakfasts.  Gallagher joins the conversation, discussing his girlfriend, her daughter, and plans for the daughter's modeling career. He talks about his business ventures, including a new slot machine concept, a Yao Ming-themed cowboy hat, and a horse-shaped toy, and mentions being cut from *Little Fockers*. The segment ends with Kelly and Gallagher in-studio.

A significant portion of the show is dedicated to Gallagher, discussing his career, inventions (like a non-overflowing toilet), failed attempts to get his watermelon slot machine adopted, reasons for not having a Vegas residency, and opinions on various topics. He mentions his comedic style's influence on acts like the Blue Man Group and Insane Clown Posse. He recounts a legal battle with his brother over impersonation and shares views on the military, politics (Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy), and society.  He offers profane observations on human behavior, discusses Tiger Woods' infidelity and a supposed golf club attack by his girlfriend, and comments on tattoos and societal absurdities (telephone poles, parkway/driveway names). He mentions his business ideas (including a family reunion resort).  He discusses his health issues, including a heart condition.  Bob Kelly is briefly involved, with Gallagher offering comedic advice. Gallagher's upcoming shows and online presence are also mentioned.

The final segment focuses on Gallagher's stage act. He discusses the logistics and comedic value of smashing things with a sledgehammer, referencing past performances and planning an on-air smashing session.  They discuss selecting items for optimal effect.  The planned smashing ensues, involving watermelon, pineapple, coffee, and a pie, splattering Opie and Anthony. Gallagher demonstrates his technique and promotes his shows.  The segment includes discussion of his past success, current financial situation, and the use of his videos in cancer research.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio, we've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw, sexual content is realistic, and just fucking people reacting with people is realistic. 
[00:00:30]  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit Radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God, Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this, Plaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Plaver.  Plaver.  Plaver.  Plaver.  Plaver.  I'm adding more Plaver.  Hey, everybody.  I thought we had another minute or two.  Nah, I've got to choke down some Cheerios.  What are you eating?  Cheerios?  Multi-grain.  Multi-grain.  Yum.  What's the difference?  I don't know.  I always thought a Cheerio is a Cheerio.  Um, it doesn't taste like cardboard. 
[00:01:30]  Really?  Or as much like cardboard.  Yeah.  I don't even think people ate that anymore.  I thought they were just for, like, to put in little Tupperware where you can take little  kids around with you.  Those Cheerios.  And then they take their sticky little hands and try to hand them to you.  They're like, get that away from me.  You know what?  Speaking of kids, the, uh, the marshmallow gun, I can't, I can't, I can't even imagine. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And one was at your house.  Yes, two.  There were two marshmallow guns.  And I was telling the story to some people, and they're like, oh yeah, yeah, my sister  has one of those.  I'm like, who the fuck invented this thing?  They should be shot.  Funk, funk, funk.  That's what it does.  By marshmallows.  Oh, just think how many, uh, your frat guys could have shot up their asses with it.  They could have, like, really, uh, all right. 
[00:02:30]  Uh, so it was kind of gay.  What can I tell you?  Oh, look, see, there's a demonstration on, uh, what is that?  A marshmallow, um, bow and arrow.  They have a marshmallow gun.  That's the one, uh, that was at the house.  And, and there, the guy's shooting it, and, and marshmallows go all over.  He's got a whole bunch of different marshmallow toys.  A marshmallow laws rocket.  A little marshmallow pistol. 
[00:03:00]  Uh, oh, that one's very tactical looking.  Marshmallow.  It's a full-size marshmallow.  Wow, yeah, you put one in the magazine.  All right, see, that one's pretty cool.  Give me a break.  Yeah, well, couldn't, couldn't they just do this with, uh, styrofoil?  Styrofoam?  So the cleanup isn't bad?  No, styrofoam would be a mess, too.  Bust apart.  Like packing peanuts.  Something.  Well, this guy, uh, loves his marshmallows.  Yeah, great. 
[00:03:30]  I, I can't imagine the parents love it.  No.  They have to clean up after little fuckers.  Goes all over the place.  Ah, yuck.  Sorry about that.  That's all right.  I got distracted because we're kind of broadcasting from a bubble today.  Yeah, there's a lot of, uh, a lot of plastic hanging up.  Someone said it looks like an episode of, uh, Dexter.  Where, where the plastic is around and he's ready to take some, uh, serial killer out or  something.  Yeah, right on.  We should get a chainsaw today.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Chop up an intern.  Hack some people up.  Well, we have Gallagher coming in today and the last time he came in, we didn't, we didn't  need plastic.  What's this plastic all about?  That was, uh, over at, uh, CBS over there, over at, uh, KROQ.  You mean regular radio?  Regular radio.  Where, you know, there's so many restrictions and you can't do this or that.  Exactly.  But when it came to Gallagher, oh, he did whatever he wanted and there was no plastic. 
[00:04:30]  No plastic.  Granted, the company, the company's, uh, you know, they weren't happy and they're still  finding pieces of Gallagher's act all over the studio.  Still.  But we got plastic today.  It's everywhere.  It's going to get really hot in here.  I was thinking that, like.  It's going to be like a greenhouse effect, right?  Are we going to be all like, uh, suffocating and can't breathe?  There's, there's one air conditioning, uh, vent is half covered. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, well.  I think that's a return.  Thank God they didn't cover up the, uh, the vents.  Oh, my God.  We'd suffocate in here.  That'd be great.  They'd probably rather that happen.  Good.  Only suffocated in their own studio.  Great.  Great.  We're finally done with them.  And it didn't cost us nothing.  It was two accidental deaths.  Fuckers.  What is Gallagher going to be, um, smashing?  Uh, you know what?  I mean, he's going to be doing his basic thing, but he's a lunatic. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  For the people that have never heard Gallagher on our show, I would suggest you stick around  today and check it out.  Because he is, the guy's insane.  Yeah, it's not just, you know, him doing his act where he takes his handy dandy sledge-o-matic  and does his little, uh, spiel and then smashes it.  Right.  He'll sit here, get on mic, and just talk about world events and-  Aliens and-  Bullshit.  And you're going, okay.  Illuminati.  Yeah.  Uh, thermite paint.  I'm sure he has something.  I'm sure. 
[00:06:00]  I want to ask him about that.  Uh, the stock market, of course.  He's big into that.  And, uh, he is insane.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he loves day trading.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he'll spend the rest of the day here, long after we're gone, day trading.  Because he needs a comfortable place to do it.  Yeah, he'll find somewhere and go, hey, can I plug in over here?  And then he'll just sit there and day trade away.  He'll just sit on the floor and day trade.  First time he came on, we're like, ah, Gallagher, all right.  That's a goof.  Yeah, we'll take him with the help.  Now we can't wait. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, good Gallagher.  We can't wait to have him back.  I don't understand, though, all the plastic and everything.  It is, um, it is radio.  I mean, we, you know, does he have to smash things again?  He's crazy enough where he could just sit here and kind of just talk and be a nut.  True.  But apparently...  He probably doesn't want to smash anything.  I know.  He's probably at the point where it's like, you know, I'll just sit down and bullshit with  you guys.  I don't need to smash something.  There's a few heads I would love to smash.  Oh, bring them in here.  Day three, I hope it's only day three. 
[00:07:00]  These are just pleasantries.  I told you.  Pleasantries.  I understand.  No names.  I understand that whole thing about having a new start.  These are just pleasantries.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  I can imagine heads on a fucking wooden block with a mallet coming down hard on it.  Oh, man.  Big fucking mallet.  Like that scene in Braveheart where he rides the horse in and takes that big metal mace and  smashes that guy's face in.  Just caves his head in.  That's what I want to see Gallagher do. 
[00:07:30]  God, wouldn't that be great?  We'll figure something out.  Unfortunately, yeah, Gary Coleman, it's going to be on the phone because we could have him  smash Gary Coleman, which would really be a bunch of Gary Coleman all over the wall.  And after Gary Coleman's last appearance, I think he would sign up for that.  He probably would.  He wants someone to put him out of his misery.  As long as he gets a check for it.  He's an angry little fucker.  Oh, is he nasty?  He's a nasty little fidge. 
[00:08:00]  He is not a happy person.  No, and he's calling in to promote something he did nothing but bash the shit out of when  it was out in theaters.  When he was here last time.  And no one saw it.  No one.  After he...  I forgot about the movie.  Never saw advertising for it.  Never saw it on a marquee.  No, nothing.  Never saw a preview when I was watching other movies.  No, I didn't see a trailer for it or anything.  Ready?  We interviewed the guy about the movie.  Yeah.  They told us yesterday why he's coming in. 
[00:08:30]  Anthony, what's the name of the movie?  Uh, let me think.  I'm not looking at anything because listeners know everything.  They'll print it right up there.  What's the name of the movie?  Is it something with midgets?  Short, little people?  Um...  Okay, what's the plot of the movie?  He's in a circus?  Dude, we talked to him about it for an hour.  For an hour. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  I've been in meetings with people down the hall for an hour and forgot by the time I hit  the elevator.  You know what?  I'm right with you.  I couldn't name the movie.  I couldn't name the plot.  Nothing.  Nothing?  Yeah.  Is it a comedy?  Do we know that much?  Well, if Gary Coleman's in it, it's got to be at least funny in some way, shape, or form.  For the freak show factor.  He might as well just sleep in.  He doesn't need to call. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, what's he doing?  What good is that going to do today?  None good.  Nah.  None good.  All right, so we got Gallagher.  We got Gary Coleman.  And I want to start with Club Soda Kenny today.  Wow.  The star-studded show today.  He was driving.  We got Bob Kelly.  That's a big get.  Oh, that is.  That's a big, huge get right there.  Robbie.  He even tweeted that he's going to be on our show.  All excited.  Oh, he did?  He said, oh, I haven't been on their show in quite a long time. 
[00:10:00]  He's a tweeting whore, because it's 90% of his tweets, more than that, even probably  95, are just plugs for his shows.  Yeah, most of the comedians, that's pretty much what they do with their Twitter.  Is that TV stretching on the sides?  No.  I don't think it is.  That's just time.  Is that what's happening?  Getting a little...  Are you fucking kidding me?  She looks ridiculously good today. 
[00:10:30]  No, I know.  Yesterday, you should have made fun of her in her square dance.  The little house on the prairie shirt.  Her square down dance.  No, I'm saying that looks good and everything.  One more time?  Once more into the breach.  One more?  One more time!  One more time!  I don't think I'd have a shot in hell after what I did.  Ooh, that means you're thinking about it. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, I'll throw anyone a fucking, you know.  That's what you do when you're single, though, man.  You gotta go back to some of your spots.  You gotta go back.  You always go back, see what happens.  What happened?  Did you have the breakup fuck?  Wait, it's the pics cuddle up with Jill Snuggie?  Oh, my God.  Wait, where do you get that?  Please get Anthony one.  No!  Get out of here!  Would you put that on if we got you one? 
[00:11:30]  No, I don't think I'd put that on.  Did you have the breakup sex, Ant?  The cuddle up with Jill Snuggie?  No, no.  After we broke up?  Oh, that means you definitely have a shot.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Breakup sex, man.  After it's all, after all the ugliness, you know, settles down, you get that one last  one in.  And both sides usually agree to that.  Yeah?  If not, you know.  If not, you know.  Hmm.  I mean, yeah.  You gotta do the breakup sex, and then it's official. 
[00:12:00]  Should I put the feelers out?  Yeah.  Put the feelers out?  Just get the feelers out there that you want to do the breakup sex.  Because it makes it official.  Enough time's gone by, right?  Well, that's what I mean.  What's the date?  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  When the ugliness settles.  Okay.  All right.  Then all of a sudden, like, you reconnect, just have sex, and then after that sex is  over, you will never talk to her again.  That's just how it happens.  All right.  You've never had that happen?  Over the years? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I think I have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, here.  Here, here, here, I'll put the feelers out there.  Okay.  We'll see if, you know.  Wow, you're lonely.  Once more.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know.  I don't want to make it sound like that.  You're an asshole.  You coax me into it, and then you go, God, you're lonely.  I just fucking set you up so bad.  I know.  Geez, you're pathetic. 
[00:13:00]  What are you doing?  I have the feelers.  I just want to cuddle up with Jill Snuggie.  Yeah, start with the Snuggie.  Someone has to get us one of those Snuggies with Jill on it.  Take a picture of me.  Of course, talking about the traffic girl here in New York City that Anthony had a fling with.  A fling.  Was it a relationship or a fling?  I don't know.  It looked like a relationship for, like, a summer.  It was a summer.  It was a summer fling, I guess you'd call it. 
[00:13:30]  It was 90 days of summer.  Yeah, but it kind of, you know, it moved along very quickly.  It was an entire, like, relationship most people would have in years compacted into three months.  It was dizzying for everybody.  It was dizzying.  Holy shit.  Everybody's reminding me.  They're just saying I'm crazy.  Don't put the feelers out. 
[00:14:00]  Remember the fire.  Yeah, but I think people would agree.  He has to have the breakup sex still.  You think?  It's Jill's birthday on Monday.  So why don't you send some flowers over there?  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  That'll be a good way to break the ice, I guess.  Yeah.  Send some flowers over there?  Yeah.  How did I not even know that?  I'm not good with birthdays.  It was a whirlwind affair that lasted three months.  We don't even know what movie Gary Coleman's promoting. 
[00:14:30]  And we talked to him about it for an hour.  You know what it is?  We're just exhausted when we're awake.  It's very hard to remember things when you're constantly exhausted.  Maybe young Sam knows.  I don't know.  He knows everything.  All right, Jan.  Jan.  You got to send something over there for her birthday.  Yeah, you think I should do that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll send out...  Let's get Kenny in here because on the way home yesterday, 
[00:15:00]  Ann should go buy the cheapest sheets he can find before he goes back to that.  See, I think that's going to put a damper on any effort.  Yeah, maybe we should keep that on the QT.  Maybe I was speaking out of anger.  Hi, Kenny.  Good morning.  There he is.  Good morning.  Hi, Club Soda Kenny.  Hi.  Good morning.  What are you printing out?  Stuff for everybody.  He's always very vague. 
[00:15:30]  I like that about Kenny.  He always has stuff he has to do for everybody.  Just dumb little chores.  No, if you want, these are the fine dining restaurants at the fancy Bogota Hotel and Casino.  I'm going down there for Jim Norton's gift.  Yeah, I'm making you a dinner reservation.  Are you going down in?  Yes.  Yeah.  We're all going down next Friday and Saturday.  He's got a casino host.  The Homestead Steakhouse?  Yeah, what about it?  Very good.  I'm going to that Asian restaurant.  Oh, that place is mint, Danny, right? 
[00:16:00]  What about Bobby Flay Steak?  Bobby Flay.  Bobby Flay.  Bobby Flay is very good.  What about Forma Molotolito, the Italian restaurant?  Ah, stay away from me.  Oh, yeah.  Too much pasta.  I don't know.  You can get that anywhere.  Yeah, me and Ann are the only skinny DJs in America.  Yeah, we're trying to keep it that way.  Vacation, I packed on a few pounds.  Have some nice fish.  Yeah, you could do that.  But don't forget Wolfgang Puck. 
[00:16:30]  Yes, Wolfgang Puck.  Overrated what?  And then I have another special thing I have for GH.  Oh.  What's that?  A finger in the hiney?  Besides that, that's a given.  Kenny was driving me home yesterday.  And remember the joke he sent to everybody about getting a massage?  Oh, yes, yes.  So, I just, I brought it up yesterday on the way home saying how funny that was and, you 
[00:17:00]  know, fucking, I'm still laughing over that.  I'm still laughing at the fact that he loved the joke so much he, he, he sent it to everyone.  Oh, everyone.  Before he told it here on the air yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He sent the joke.  He was very proud of this joke.  What was the joke again for people maybe that didn't hear it, Kenny?  Ooh.  I got a massage the other day.  Yeah.  And I didn't want to feel like I was cheating on my wife, so I asked for a male masseuse.  Yeah.  And I ended up cheating on my wife anyway. 
[00:17:30]  He loves this joke.  He loves that joke.  So, then he says there's so much to the massage.  Mm-hmm.  And he starts telling me this, and I'm laughing my ass off.  I'm like, oh, my God, just don't tell me anymore.  You got to tell me and Ann on the show today.  Meaning, well, I said yesterday, meaning today, whatever.  So, here's Kenny and the massage story.  Basically, it starts with Jim Norton and his girl were getting a massage, and they decided  to treat you to a massage as well, right?  Yes. 
[00:18:00]  They were getting, like, a couple's massage or something.  Right.  We were in Florida over last weekend for New Year's in a fancy hotel, and, you know, Jim  treats himself.  He gets pampered, and I've never had a massage before, so he insisted.  Okay.  He would not take no for an answer that I get a massage also.  Okay.  So, I went down, and we go, him and his lady were getting a couple's massage.  I was on my own.  But me and Norton go into the men's locker room.  His lady went in a female.  I don't know what to do.  I didn't even know what to wear. 
[00:18:30]  I had to ask him.  I just put on my bathing suit.  You put on a bathing?  Did you put on your swim trunks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would you put on your bathing suit?  I didn't know what to wear.  Mm-hmm.  You just wore your underwear.  I didn't know.  Or sometimes you go son's underwear.  Ew.  Yeah.  So, I had my bathing suit on t-shirts.  I need a nude under the sheet.  Nude.  Mm-hmm.  Sneakers.  And so, then, like, me and Norton, we get our lockers, and we're disrobing. 
[00:19:00]  Ooh.  And, uh, you know, they give you, like, uh, like, uh, you know, like a robe to wear, like  a fancy robe.  Sure.  And they give you, like, these flip-flops and everything.  And, uh, so I just kept my bathing suit on.  I didn't know what to do.  And, like, he wanted to go, like, in the steam room first.  You know, because they got, like, steam sauna.  They got whirlpools and everything.  Mm-hmm.  You know, to relax.  Because we were there, like, five minutes early for the massage.  Yeah.  So, we go in the steam room, and then, all of a sudden, like, they call him and his lady 
[00:19:30]  for their couple's massage.  All righty.  And leaving you.  I'm on my own.  Right.  You know.  Solo.  Yeah, the public nuisance is now on its own.  Yes.  So, I didn't know what to do.  So, I figured, you know what?  Let me go take a shower.  So, like, when I go to the masseuse, like, I won't smell like a baked ox.  Because I've been sitting in the steam room.  Exactly.  And you've been to a spa, right, by now?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I have been.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  So, I go.  I take my bathing suit off.  I rinse off in the shower.  I put my bathing suit back on.  The lady calls me.  So, I go out in the hall, and she's like, what are you doing?  I go, I'm getting a massage.  She goes, where's your robe and slippers?  I go, what do I need them for?  She's just standing in the hallway.  She's standing there.  In a bathing suit.  In a bathing suit.  Yeah.  And she's horrified.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's like.  Because I guess protocol in this place is, you know, you got a nice robe they give you. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, it's a fancy.  And some flip-flops.  Why didn't you have the robe and slippers?  What do I need?  I'm going to take them off.  I'm getting my back rubbed.  Just give me some thick, gooey lotion and get to work.  You know, have strong hands.  That's all I care about.  Yeah.  You're old school.  Yeah.  I never had a massage.  I didn't know.  So, she's like, you got to put on a robe and slippers.  Yeah, you didn't.  She's like chastising me.  Of course. 
[00:21:00]  Well, she should.  So, I go back in.  And she said, this is a spa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She goes, yeah, this is a spa.  You got to put on a robe and slippers like I'm a little middle-aged lady, you know, yelling  at me.  So, I go, all right.  So, I go in and I put on the robe.  And, you know, it's like one size fits all.  Oh, not you, though.  Not me.  The freak show.  You know, so I barely get this thing on, you know.  And I got to stretch it, you know, to cover, you know, thank God I had my bathing suit 
[00:21:30]  on or I would have been exposed like a...  Oh.  Yeah.  So, and then, like, they give you flip-flops.  I don't know what size they were, but they don't fit on my feet.  No, you're giant.  So, I had to force them on, right?  And then, you know how you go walk and the flip-flop makes that noise like...  That's why they're called flip-flops.  Yeah.  They kind of flip-flop while you walk.  Yeah, so now I go back to the hall, the hallway, the lady's waiting there.  She goes, oh, now you look like a spa person. 
[00:22:00]  So, she's like, follow me.  You know, and I had to just put on this robe to walk five feet to the massage room.  I don't want people looking at other people in their goddamn swim trunks walking down the hallway.  I didn't know.  It might scare people.  It wasn't like I was wearing a Speedo or a little banana hammock.  Kenny's old school, though.  He thinks it's like, you know, he doesn't go for a massage.  It's like, I need a rub down.  Yeah.  Just get to work on my neck.  A rub down. 
[00:22:30]  So, you're very uncomfortable in the spa, huh?  Yeah.  So, then you go in a room...  Oh, I forgot about this part.  Go ahead.  It's so small.  Like, the table, like, barely fits in there.  And, like, you know, you barely fit in there.  Well, for us regular-sized people, we fit fine.  You're a giant.  You're like that 50-foot man or something where nothing fits anymore.  So, we go in there, and I'm like, she's like, get undressed. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  She goes, I'll leave the room.  I go, get undressed?  For what?  I go, like, what do I...  Don't I keep my bathing suit?  Like, what kind of massage is this?  It's sounding sexy now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, she goes, I go, do I keep my bathing suit on?  What do I do?  She goes, well, no, you can take your bathing suit off.  This way, I can get in the glutes real good.  The glutes.  Your ass.  Yeah.  Well, she said the professional term.  Right.  She wanted to get in that ass. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And, at least, thank God I knew what she meant.  Yeah.  You know, so she's like, all right.  And, she leaves the room for a second.  And, I hang up the robe.  I take off my bathing suit.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I'm not shy.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know what this is leading up to.  All right.  So, then, you know, you get on the massage table.  And, you have to, like, get under the sheet.  Yeah.  You know.  And, then, like, you lay face down. 
[00:24:00]  And, they have, like, the ring to put your head in and your face in.  Yeah, yeah.  And, she starts, like, rubbing my neck.  And, then, you know, it's like, where you from?  Oh, small talk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, whenever I'm traveling on the road, like, when people ask me where I'm from, I always tell them, Decimal Point, Long Island.  And, they looked at me crazy, because, you know, the place doesn't exist.  And, I go, yeah, it's a very small, affluent community.  Thank you, Jesus. 
[00:24:30]  Decimal Point.  Yeah.  See, you say, you say, I understand, like, the joke.  But, you say it kind of, you put the accent in the wrong spot.  It's like, you don't say I'm from Decimal Point, Long Island.  Right.  You go, I'm from Decimal Point.  Because, if anything with a point, you know, on Long Island is affluent.  Yeah.  So, you go, I'm from Decimal Point.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to help you out.  No, no, no.  I don't need help.  Did he say it? 
[00:25:00]  Decimal Point.  Decimal Point.  Yeah.  You know, it's, you've got to accent the point part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They go, where's that?  I go, ah, it's way out.  It's way out there.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like, then they're afraid to say anything else, because then they feel stupid.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  If that shuts them up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I don't want to act condescending.  So, how are the glutes?  How did she get the glutes?  Oh, we'll get to that, so.  Oh, excuse me.  She, like.  Wait, you didn't like, you didn't like your face in the,  in the whole thing. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What, do you want me to rush the story?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  This world coming to.  Oh, shit.  I, nigh.  But she puts on the lotion.  It didn't even feel slick-like.  No?  No.  No, shit lotion.  What did you expect?  Like, KY or?  Yeah.  You'll lube it up.  Nice.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, like glass, smooth.  What would it feel like?  Just like, uh. 
[00:26:00]  It didn't feel like what I expected.  Like Noxzema?  I don't know.  It was just like.  It wasn't Noxzema.  It wasn't silky smooth?  No.  And then I'm laying there with my head and thing,  and like GH pointed out,  my nose started like dripping.  Oh, shit.  So now I'm like sniffling,  and I feel stupid,  because I'm like sniffling,  and my nose is getting stuffy.  Yeah.  Because I'm laying face down and thing.  And the lady goes,  you need a tissue?  I go, did I ask for a tissue?  No, I'm all right. 
[00:26:30]  It's just.  Now, now his massage is turning into just violent.  Just.  A massage is supposed to be relaxing.  He's having an argument now.  You should be in a place where you're just mellowing.  They got this stupid music on in the background.  What kind of music?  Some Yanni?  Yeah, whatever.  Some New Age.  New Age, Sam, Fearcock.  New Age shit.  Yeah.  And the lights are low,  and they got like a fucking candle incense burning.  Was there water sounds?  Like a little stream or some waves? 
[00:27:00]  Nah, just that stupid music.  And aromatherapy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now she's like rubbing my neck,  and she's like, is it good?  I go, I got nothing to compare it to.  I never had a massage.  You couldn't just say.  You can't figure it out.  Yeah, it's good.  You can't figure it out.  It might be a bit pleasurable.  So it's supposed to be like a deep.  Not that way, because you're married, you know.  Yeah, yeah, no.  I take no pleasure in anything.  That's kidding. 
[00:27:30]  It really is.  It's supposed to be like a deep tissue massage.  So she goes, does it hurt?  I go, I got a very high tolerance for pain.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, just fucking, you know, just rub my neck.  Because I'm going like, do I got to talk to her?  Like, what's my move?  Like, what do I do now?  You don't want talking.  No, you just want to relax, I would gather.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so then she's like, since I never had a massage, she's like explaining the whole  massage process.  Now, she's going to start with my neck and the shoulders, the back, getting the glutes 
[00:28:00]  real good and my legs.  And then she goes, and then I'm going to flip you over.  And I go, I know what that means.  Now, I assume this wasn't the kind of establishment where you get the old Yankee crank, yeah, rub  and tug after she's done with the glutes.  I don't know.  Hearing everybody else's stories, I thought that was just par for the course. 
[00:28:30]  Standard operating procedure.  Right.  So, you yelled out, I know what that means.  Yeah.  I mean, fucking Norton paid a lot of money for that massage.  I guess.  And the tip was included on top of it.  Oh, so you were set, you were hooked up.  Oh, yeah.  You were set up nice.  Yeah.  So, she's rubbing, and I think I might have...  What nationality was the woman?  I think she was a Jewish woman.  Uh-oh.  Little middle-aged, nice.  Nice?  All right, all right, I'm just saying, not Asian.  No.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  No.  You're a married man, remember?  Yeah.  What do you mean by nice?  What do you mean here?  Yeah.  No, she was a nice lady, you know, kosher.  Kosher.  Kosher.  Yeah, all right.  You were getting a kosher massage.  Yeah.  So, I think I might have conked out for like a minute.  Uh-oh.  And then it was time to flip over.  So, like, I flipped over.  Please tell me you had a tent.  Well, no, because...  Oh, you were pitching a tent.  It's funny, because I told Norton the whole massage story, and the only question he asks 
[00:29:30]  is, did you come?  But I was like, no.  He's like, you know, did you get a woody?  I go, you know, with practice, I could have maybe, you know.  Yeah.  So, but I wasn't thinking about it.  How close did she get to touching your genitalia?  Nothing.  No, really?  Yeah, like, she was doing upper thighs, or what?  Like, even when she did the glutes, she, like, positions the fucking, uh, what do you call 
[00:30:00]  it?  Sheet towel.  The sheet, my ass crack.  Oh, really?  So, there's no real touching of the ass crack?  Yeah, there's no chance of even a mistake.  Yeah.  She can't slip a pinky in by accident?  Yeah.  No oopsies?  No, and then when she goes flip over, I go, which way?  Because, like, if I flip over one way, my cock and balls is facing her.  I think, technically, you're supposed to, like, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Turn away from her.  Yeah, well, that's, I did the gentlemanly thing, and I turned away from her.  Gentlemanly.  Yeah.  But then I noticed, like, as I turned around, she had that fucking sheet picked up all the  way, like, covering her face.  So, like, she couldn't even peek if she wanted to.  Oh, maybe she did that for your benefit.  She's a fucking prude.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it sounds like.  You would think if you're a massage therapist, you're going to at least peek.  That sounds like a legitimate spa massage where no shenanigans happen. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe, you know, or at the very least, like, you know, if Jimmy's in there, he knows the  rap and everything, so he knows what to say.  Yeah, he's the negotiator.  The magic words.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you're just laying there with your...  Yeah, like a schlub.  Your balls almost hanging out, and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting, getting...  Now, did it feel, when you're done, were you like, all right, that's all right?  Yeah, when I was completely done, and you go to get up, I felt like woozy. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  She's like, oh, you've got to drink water now to flush out the toxins.  I go, I'm not even thirsty, you drink water.  Yeah, you flush out the toxins.  She's just trying to take care of you.  I don't know if that's true or not, by the way.  Yeah, what do you have to do?  What are the toxins things?  Yeah, I'm not toxic.  Yeah, what happened?  Was she a magic woman?  Because she's rubbing you?  Right.  She's rubbing toxins out of your muscles?  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on, what's that about?  Kenny's been fucking beat up by skills.  Right.  Yeah.  You didn't drink water after that? 
[00:32:00]  You go for some scotch.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, thumbs up or down on the massage and will you get another one?  Yeah, when you treat me to one.  Yeah, he's not paying for it.  All right.  We got it next weekend.  I can't...  The next one's on me, I guess.  Yeah, I can't afford those luxuries.  Yeah.  You think it's a luxury?  Yeah.  You like it?  I'm a very simple man with simple needs, if you haven't noticed.  I don't think you have to really push that point. 
[00:32:30]  You have to yell that out too loud.  That's the simple man part.  Yeah, so that's my entire massage story.  It just sounded kind of not relaxing.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounded very confrontational.  Like everything a massage isn't supposed to be.  Confrontational, nerve-wracking, upsetting, fucking...  I'm a public nuisance.  Apparently so.  Just a tug of war going on in there. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just battling it out.  She should have tugged a little bit.  Your nose cleared up also?  Yeah, once you turn...  She goes, nobody likes laying down.  Because I guess it's like gravity.  All your snot flows out of your nose.  Well, especially since she's pushing it out of you.  All the toxins.  You just...  After a while, you just let your nose drip on whatever the fuck's below.  I couldn't do that.  Who cares?  It feels...  Let's just drip. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't know.  I didn't know what I was doing.  Gotta remember to shove a few tissues up your nostrils when you get a massage, maybe.  I don't know.  All right, Kenny.  Good job.  Kenny, wow.  Your first massage.  Yeah.  Hope your second one goes a little smoother, a little more relaxing.  I got a good colonoscopy story for another day, too.  Another day?  Yeah, you don't want too much of me in one day.  You always gotta leave them wanting more.  How long is it? 
[00:34:00]  It's quick.  Oh, we gotta go with a quick story, right?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll finish up with Kenny here.  Yeah.  I got a spastic colon like nobody believes me.  So...  What does that entail?  Yeah, what does that mean?  I live my life through my asshole.  I got irritable bowel syndrome or something.  Are you one of those people that...  What does that do?  Do you have to only take dumps at home?  Are you one of those people?  I'll take a dump on the side of the road if I gotta go. 
[00:34:30]  There are people out there.  They'll call now.  The home field advantage.  They can only crap at home.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard that.  Like Fezzy.  Fezzy's one of them.  Oh, Fezzy's one of them?  Oh, yeah.  He'll only take a shit at home.  Jesus.  I'll take a shit anywhere.  I don't care.  Yeah?  I don't even wipe the fucking seat.  I just sit the fucking seat.  Oh, yeah.  I sit down.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I sit right down.  Who cares?  I've seen Jimmy, like, use those papers that you put out that lines the toilet seat.  It's like, you know something? 
[00:35:00]  Get out of here.  I'm sitting down.  I don't give a shit.  He's very ritualistic.  Well, yes.  Yes, he is.  Yeah.  But that paper, that fucking wax paper.  Nah, you just sit right down.  Fucking butcher paper you've got to sit on.  Yeah, it's your fucking asshole.  Who cares?  Exactly.  And that's not even touching the seat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get a pimple every once in a while because the seat was a little greasy, but it's what's  the...  Oh, oh.  I don't know how long you're going to sit there.  Yuck.  So I decided to go to the doctor, and they're giving me the colonoscopy, so you know, you 
[00:35:30]  got to, like, take your clothes off, and they give you that, like, paper gown that you're  supposed to put on.  Oh, yeah.  So I put it on, and I'm very tall, so the thing didn't fit.  So my little trouser worm was hanging out the bottom of the paper gown.  You and the little paper gown.  It was like a mini skirt.  Yeah, yeah.  So, but what I did, this is funny, I, like, scrunched down a little bit, like, hunched 
[00:36:00]  over.  Yeah, you squat a little bit and hunched.  Right?  And now the nurse comes in.  She goes, are you ready?  I go, the thing doesn't fit.  And then, like, I stood up real tall, so, like, jack-in-the-box popped out.  And then, so then she, like, gave me another one to put around my waist like a skirt.  Oh, okay.  So you had to wrap one around there, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now you, like, you go in the doctor's thing, and there's a table, and he tells you to lie  on your side, kind of like in the fetal position. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  You know, because he's going to stick that pipe up your ass.  Oh, boy.  Knees up.  Holy shit.  I had to go knees up once.  Oh, not one.  God.  And then there's, like, the TV there, because when he sticks the pipe up your ass with the  camera, he, like, watches it on the TV.  He's like, you can, I go, you're the fucking doctor, you watch.  I don't want to see that.  Exactly.  Right?  So I'm laying on my side in the fetal position, all right?  And the nurse, the doctor's behind me by my ass, and the nurse is in front of me, and  she's got her hands, like, folded on the table, like, right there. 
[00:37:00]  So, as a goof, I just reached out and put my hand on top of her two hands.  Why would you do that?  Like you needed help?  Yeah, because you go, like, ooh, like, every, you feel every fucking turn going up your fucking  ass pipe.  I would assume.  Yeah, you would.  So, just, you know, just for, to, you know, so I put my hand on top of her two hands, and  she don't move away or flinch. 
[00:37:30]  No.  You know.  She's probably used to that.  So, now what I did was, I started pulling her hands close to my cock.  No, you didn't.  And that's when she pulled away.  What is wrong with you?  Jesus.  I don't know, you just got to kill time.  Yeah, I guess so.  I thought they slipped you like a Valium for that.  That's when you get the big one.  I got, oh, no, I got the sigmoid osteopae. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know what the fuck.  The little one.  That's the little pipe.  Yeah?  Yeah, the sigmoid osteopae is the one I got.  I would still want to be put the fuck out.  The colon osteopae, you get put out.  You get the propofol?  Yeah, I only got the little pipe in my ass.  For the people out there, don't ever get the propofol, because then you realize that we just  die.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  What?  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  You went to the place?  Oh, yeah.  When I had, I had, I, they put the pipe down my throat for my acid reflux, and I was on 
[00:38:30]  the propofol, and you're knocked out cold, and then you're waking up in the fucking recovery  room, and you realize, holy shit, you just died.  That's pretty much what it is.  Because why isn't there any memory of being under at all?  Yeah, your brain just shuts off.  It just shuts off.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  So when you actually die, you're trying to tell me the brain doesn't just shut off like  it does when they give you the propofol?  Well, you're, maybe your spirit, maybe your spirit didn't leave your body yet.  Dude, I haven't talked about this yet.  The propofol makes you, makes you realize there's no God. 
[00:39:00]  It's a time machine, suspended animation.  Yeah, they just casually give this, they casually give this to people, and then you  wake up going, holy fuck, there's no God.  Mm.  Because they could just erase your memory by shutting your whole system down?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think happens when you fucking die?  Your whole system shuts down.  Yep.  Well, my spirit realized it wasn't time to kind of do a spiritual thing?  Yeah, all your, all your goods were still working, so, you know, your spirit didn't  leave your body yet, I guess.  They shouldn't casually give people propofol, because that is, that's some heavy, heavy 
[00:39:30]  thinking after, after you go through that.  Is that the Michael Jackson drug?  Oh, yeah.  They give it all the time.  Yeah.  You're just not supposed to have it at home, you know, for hours at a time.  While a doctor's downstairs reading.  Next to the Advil.  Right.  Fuck.  Can I be excused?  I have some tasks to complete.  Ah, I see.  What's your list of tasks today?  A lot of dinner reservations.  Well, no, at the immediate moment, I have to go park the trucks and get gas. 
[00:40:00]  Yes, yes, I'm a little low on petroleum.  Oof.  Right.  Price of gas going up, they're saying.  It means nothing to you guys.  Ah, no, I know that.  I'm just saying.  It means a little bit to us.  It was a rough year.  It was a rough year, Kenny.  It was a rough year.  It means a little bit to us.  Yeah.  Yeah, apparently, you know, because of the cold snap, they decide, ah, we're going to  raise the price of fuel.  Isn't that great? 
[00:40:30]  And always just taking advantage of the common man.  And unlike when the price per barrel goes down, and then they say, well, it hasn't gotten  to the gas stations yet.  So we'll see.  We'll start seeing a dip at the stations in about a month and a half to two months.  The second it goes up, those friggin' savages are out there by those signs cranking the  numbers up.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I never understood that one.  They just take advantage of us at every turn.  Price gouging.  How about Christmas comes around? 
[00:41:00]  You know, we're out of that season now, officially.  I got rid of my tree, and I think you said.  Yeah, yeah, yesterday all mine went.  Yesterday seemed to be the day to do it.  I think I was supposed to wait for the epiphany.  Isn't that the ninth?  Oh, really?  There's an actual day you're supposed to wait till?  Yeah, yeah.  The epiphany.  Hell fucking no.  I don't know what it was.  That's on a Saturday.  Who's fucking with their tree on a Saturday?  I wait till somebody comes in, takes my shit down.  Remember when Christmas came around, you would turn on your TV, and you get to watch any 
[00:41:30]  Christmas movie you want?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you pay these cable bills.  Mine is well over $100 now.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  How much is my cable bill, Ken?  I don't know.  Just keep signing the checks I put in front of you.  I think it's over $100, right?  And so you're paying the cable company a lot of money.  They're getting a nice chunk of change from me.  They can't do me a favor and have all the Christmas movies there for free? 
[00:42:00]  Do you solid.  They fucking put them on demand.  On demand.  To take advantage of the common man.  Of course.  What's that about?  You're already paying them.  My cable bill is about $250.  $250?  About $250.  Why is it that high?  I don't know.  I don't think mine's that high.  Because I get everything.  Do you get everything?  What do you mean by everything?  I don't get the stupid, like, fucking...  I don't get all the sports.  I don't get, like, the NBA and NHL where they have every game on.  No, I don't get those packages. 
[00:42:30]  But everything else, every movie channel...  I think because I get a lot of on-demand stuff, too.  I do a lot of on-demanding.  Why?  You got movies loaded, don't you?  Yeah, but sometimes I want to watch an on-demand.  I can watch on-demand downstairs, too.  That's true.  Epiphany is today, Ant.  So we just missed out.  Brian and Philly.  All we had to do was wait another day to take our trees down.  I still have my outside decorations on.  There you go.  Danny's saying my cable bill for one TV and the internet and one movie channel is $150. 
[00:43:00]  That is fucking insane.  All right.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Okay, I forgot.  I have a few fucking boxes in my house.  You know what?  What they do is, like, they don't charge you as much.  Like, once you have one, it's kind of like the satellite subscription.  But the point here, Ant, you're an exception to the rule.  Danny's more like the regular.  I'm not every man.  You're kind of like more of a regular Joe, and it's $150.  I can't do this.  That's insane.  Dude, it was more. 
[00:43:30]  It was more like $180, and I just got so...  Like, I never watch movie channels anymore, like HBO shows.  I was like, fuck it.  I don't need it.  I can't tell you how many days I'm sitting there.  I'm like, all right, I'm going to go, I'm going to watch a movie tonight.  Oh, yeah.  And I go from channel to channel to channel, and there's no good movies on.  Shit.  Or I've seen everything.  And I don't see as many movies as, like, Anthony does.  If I've seen all the movies you have to offer on your system, and you're, you know, I'm paying close to $200 a month, something is wrong.  Instant Netflix, Hulu.  You don't even need cable anymore.  I know. 
[00:44:00]  But don't even talk about the cable companies, because, you know, they'll visit you in the middle of the night.  Well, my favorite thing was the commercials that they were running, because I don't really know the details.  I didn't read up on the story at all.  The whole Fox thing?  The whole Fox thing, man.  It's just like...  I don't know what's going on.  You know, like, I paid enough for cable, dude.  I don't know what to say.  How much money?  Exactly.  Like, what do you want from me?  How much fucking money?  I just paid a bill.  I want my stupid channel.  They pretty much held them up.  Oh, yeah.  They're doing the same thing right now with the Food Network.  But that's on Cablevision. 
[00:44:30]  Home and Garden, I think.  HGTV.  Cable companies are doing it to somebody.  Yeah.  They're holding up these networks for a lot more money when they're renegotiating the contracts.  It's unbelievable.  No, I...  I mean, how much money do they need to make?  Thank God I could give a flying fuck about the Food Channel network there and the Home and Garden channel.  Well, here in New York, it was Fox.  And Fox was taking out ads, saying, this isn't fair.  You know, we're pleading...  Yeah, that's crazy.  We're pleading to our viewers, write your whoever...  Write your cable company. 
[00:45:00]  Whatever the fuck you write.  I mean, I think the cable system, the way it works these days, and just the amount of money that people charge,  I think it's headed right towards that revolution where people just say, fuck this.  I'll get all my shit online.  I don't care anymore.  I mean, that's where it went with the music industry.  And I just...  They're teetering right on that board.  Something has to give, because it's insane.  I mean, everyone's calling up now.  Their cable bill is right around Danny's, a little higher.  And these are the average people out there, not like Anthony that has 18 boxes in his house.  Yeah, there's a few boxes. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, the whole Christmas movie thing drove me nuts.  I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.  You're getting enough money from me, and now I have to pay to watch a couple Christmas classics?  You know what...  That's such bullshit.  That's really like turning the screws.  You know what's really fucking bullshit about the cable company?  I pay a lot of money for cable.  And movies, for the most part, yeah, I get through Netflix, Kaleidoscape, things, you know.  I do on demand every so often, but I could get them for other places. 
[00:46:00]  I watch a total of, seriously, probably four channels total on cable.  I watch Discovery, you know, like ID, I like that one.  Anything where there's Hitler or crime shows, real ones, not the fake fucking CSI shit.  I like the ones, you know, Cold Case Files, things like that.  I checked out your 24 Hours, finally. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit, am I hooked on that show.  I should listen to you a lot earlier.  Is that, wait, wait, first 48?  I mean, first 48, I meant.  Sorry, sorry.  First 48, that's pretty cool, huh?  Holy shit, is that cool.  Yeah, they run through the whole murder.  They sit the guy down in the interrogation rooms and they try to find out what the fuck happened.  Getting a fingerprint off a dumb, like, beer bottle or some kind of bottle.  And then next thing you know, it's already in the computer.  They know the guy, but now they've got to find the guy.  Then you realize, wow.  It's just futile.  Just like that. 
[00:47:00]  They will nail you, find a fucking hair, shit like that.  What were we going to say?  Yeah, History, Discovery, HD Theater, Science Channel.  I don't even watch Spike, to tell you the truth.  Smithsonian, I've been watching a lot of that.  A&E, I didn't watch that too much.  Military Channel, I watched that one.  Yeah, that's probably about it.  I mean.  Yeah, my.  I don't even go.  You know what?  I go right to, like, channel 45, 48, somewhere. 
[00:47:30]  I skip two through, like, all the main channels.  I don't even look to see what's on those anymore.  It doesn't matter to me.  But I'm paying for it.  There's so many channels you get lost.  And there's really cool stuff on TV, if you can find it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And then they moved my CNN.  I watch CNN.  Do they?  I watch all three, basically.  MSNBC, Fox, and CNN.  And then try to get a balanced look at things.  Oh, yes.  Fair and balanced.  And they just shoved CNN in the middle of my system. 
[00:48:00]  It's like 70-something.  Did they?  You know what they did with Cablevision, which is a pretty good thing?  You click on one of the channels, and it puts all the news channels up on the screen.  So now you can pick.  Dude, I saw that when I was on.  That's great.  When we were on vacation.  Where the fuck was I?  In between San Francisco and L.A.  Yeah.  Big Sur.  And I'm in bed in this really nice little room, and they had a huge TV, and there was 
[00:48:30]  nine freaking screens on the one TV.  Nine screens.  You pick them.  It's like Marty McFly.  Give me two 13, 35, 12.  They don't have that feature.  Matt Fry!  They don't have that feature in New York City.  They have it on Long Island?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was the best.  Because you're looking and going, oh, wait.  They have a good story on Fox, let's say.  So you click, and Fox goes full screen.  Yeah.  And then you're bored.  You go back to the nine TVs.  Is it nine, I think?  Yeah, it's like three, six, nine.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe it's nine.  I don't know.  Whatever.  And it's all the news channels, and then they have one for kids' shows. 
[00:49:00]  And they've got all the-  I forgot all about that.  I like that.  I would pay for that.  Yeah.  Let's say hot Ed in Vermont.  Ed.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Ed.  Hey, just to clarify, it's not the cable companies that want more money from the network.  It's the networks that want more money from Boss.  Uh-oh.  Awesome.  Cable companies pay millions in fees to be able to broadcast their shows, and that's what  the flights are over.  All right.  Are you in the know? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I work for Comcast.  Okay.  Well, that's why we go to the phones, you know, because we just babble and hope that  what we're saying is right, and sometimes it's not, and you guys correct us.  So how is the Food Network holding up CableVision for money?  They could be trying to charge CableVision 20 million a month.  Why would a shit channel like the Food Network-  Dude, it's not our demo.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  It's not our demo. 
[00:50:00]  I got a sister.  You got a sister.  That Food Network is fucking huge.  Are you kidding me?  Really?  They like to sit around and look at recipes and fucking cupcakes being made.  It doesn't sound really.  I'm telling you, Danny's writing the same thing.  What's that, buddy?  Your chick and your father, Danny.  All day long.  Well, my dad's cooking and stuff, so he's into that shit.  Yeah.  All day long.  That Food Network is huge, man.  I'm telling you.  Jesus Christ.  It's huge with the bruds.  Didn't know.  With the bruds.  I'll go through that.  And last night, I was watching on MTV, which I usually don't watch much MTV. 
[00:50:30]  Jersey Shore.  What's wrong?  Well, I know.  Jersey Shore.  But I was also watching, you know, they got that Pregnant Teen show.  I watch.  Teen and Pregnant.  I watch.  And then I was Teen Mom.  I watch.  The trash.  I watch.  The utter trash that is on that show.  You know who my favorite is?  The chick with the braces that gave away the fucking kid that now can't stop visiting the 
[00:51:00]  kid.  Right.  And now, finally.  And everything was cool.  She's the birth mother.  She gives the fucking baby away to this couple.  Right.  And then, like, she's a piece of white trash.  The fucking boyfriend that fathered the kids a piece of white trash.  So they meet the adoptive parents.  And everything's fine.  And Dan, they're like, oh, yeah, we'll visit and stuff.  And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you can tell now they want no part of these two trash kids.  Sure.  Visiting their fucking kid now. 
[00:51:30]  It's their kid.  It's their kid now.  Their kids stay the fuck away.  So I'm just cracking up.  This kid's always crying.  Did you see the one where the two teenagers have the kid whatever?  And then the mom and the dad of the teenagers are now married?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now they're technically brother and sister as well.  Stepbrother and sister.  Right.  And, yeah, and they have a kid together.  You want to talk about white trash?  That's another sick one.  That is fucked up.  Then there was one last night. 
[00:52:00]  I was watching this fatty that had a baby.  The fatty that went to the hotel?  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I watched.  Went to the hotel.  I actually called a motel.  Did you see when the other fatty came in with the fucking big fatty food bag and the candle?  No, I didn't see that.  Dude, he comes in.  He's the father.  I'm behind because she leaves because she can't handle this fatty anymore.  Yeah.  So she is the responsible one, I guess, even though she got pregnant at 12 and a half years  old or whatever the fuck she was.  Yeah, whatever the fuck it was. 
[00:52:30]  So decides she's going to live in a motel for a week.  And this guy being all tough and stuff, like whatever, as soon as she leaves, he's crying  like a little bitch.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where I'm at with that couple.  She went to the hotel?  Well, apparently she had to get out of the hotel.  Like, checkout time was 11.  Right.  And she's sitting there going, I don't know what to do.  Yeah.  And the fatty boyfriend came over and he leaves some bags out in front of the little  motel door and comes in and goes, could you just go in the bathroom for a little while  while I do something? 
[00:53:00]  And she's like, well, okay.  He sets a table up in one of these shit motels.  It's probably an hourly motel.  Dude, I know.  There's probably couples banging all around them.  What it looked like.  He takes what amounts to it like a citronella candle and puts it in the middle of the table.  In the middle of a card table or something.  And dishes out horrible fast food.  What, they're having a romantic dinner?  A romantic dinner at the hourly motel.  At the hourly motel with their little fat kids sitting next to them. 
[00:53:30]  It was horrible.  And then she agreed to go back to his house.  Oh, shit.  But you can tell it's only out of necessity.  I am a bit behind, but that show rules.  Oh, it really is.  It is a good one.  Continuing with the theme we started yesterday.  Well, it's an ongoing theme with our show.  It's just another freak show.  Yeah.  MTV's not getting anything done.  No.  They're not educating people on teen pregnancy or any of that shit. 
[00:54:00]  Not at all.  They're making believe they are, but that's not their number one reason for doing the show.  No fucking way, is it?  And next week, a new season starts of another show, which is one of my favorites.  And I know I'll take a lot of abuse on this one and everyone will make their jokes, but it's not for that reason.  You have to watch Little Miss Perfect.  It is the goddamn most horrific show.  Is that the teen, not the teen. 
[00:54:30]  Teen.  The baby beauty pageant.  Dude, it's like six, seven, eight, nine, ten-year-olds, whatever.  That the parents are disgusting.  Just disgusting.  They dress their kids up like complete whores.  Absolutely.  Like complete whores.  There's no way.  And have them shake their ass and all kinds of stuff.  And there's a new season starting.  And all the mothers are from the same fucking mold. 
[00:55:00]  And the host of this show, the host of the Little Miss Perfect competition, actually,  is the gayest person I've ever seen in my life.  Is that the one?  It's time for another Little Miss Perfect.  And he sings the song, you're perfect.  You are a perfect guy.  It is horrid.  Yeah.  And the mothers are all overweight, overbearing, pieces of shit. 
[00:55:30]  There was one last night I'm watching.  And this girl comes out and she's going to take some pictures of the girl.  So she starts taking some pictures.  And the girl starts making like, she's leaning against the wall with her ass poking out.  Dude, she's six years old.  And then the mother goes, white trash mother.  And she just goes, what are you doing?  This isn't Playboy.  And she goes, Playgirl, Mom. 
[00:56:00]  She goes, no, Playgirl is naked men.  She goes, Playboy is naked women.  She goes, oh, well, I want to do Playboy.  She goes, you can't do that until you're 18.  Oh, my God.  Like she's already pushing her.  Okay, when you're 18, you take your clothes off.  Everything's fine and dandy.  I would love to know what happens to some of these little girls.  I don't know.  That would be a good show.  Yeah, yeah, what happens in a really good show.  I bet you a couple porn stars are in there.  Someone is saying the singing to the little girls is so cringy. 
[00:56:30]  If you watch the guy, that's him right there.  Look at him.  Look at the guy's picture, dude.  Jesus.  His song, his Little Miss Perfect song he sings to the winner.  Can we get a copy of that?  The creepiest song.  Oh, I got it.  Oh, you got it?  Yes, I do, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  I got it.  All right.  I'd love to.  You want to set this up?  Yes, this is the host of the Little Miss Perfect pageant, and he sings to the winner. 
[00:57:00]  I will fuck you in the morning, fuck you late at night, fuck you while the moon or the sun is shining bright.  I want to fuck you, yes, I want to fuck you, yes, I want to fuck you, baby, but your door is closed. 
[00:57:30]  I want to fuck you, yes, I want to fuck you, yes, I want to fuck you, baby, but your door is closed.  I'm sorry, baby.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yes.  Little Miss Gay.  Little Miss Perfect.  I will fuck you in the kitchen, fuck you in the room, fuck you as you like, and it's quick and hard and good.  I want to fuck you, yes, I want to fuck you.  I want to fuck you, baby, but your little door is closed. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just wrong.  That's the song he sings to the little girls?  That's the song he sings at the end to the winner.  Only the winner deserves.  Only the winner deserves that, huh?  Deserves that song.  Holy shit.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  They get the, and a lot of times they get these coaches, they get these pageant coaches like this fat whore we're watching now, 
[00:59:00]  to try to whore up the girls and make them walk and hold themselves more whore-like.  No.  See, and do the little spin, and then they do their wow-wear, they call it.  Wow-wear, where they come out and have to wow the judges, and they might as well, literally, O&A, wow the judges.  Sure.  Because it is just, they dress them up in the sluttiest little things they can, and make them shake their ass and blow kisses to the judges. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  This is the shit Jean Benet was into.  I'm a fan of legalizing everything in it.  Yeah.  Basically.  Yeah, might as well.  Whatever.  But you do have politicians out there that go after our violent video games and all that shit, and our music, and this and that.  Yeah.  Do they go after this?  Do you know?  I don't know, but...  Because this seems like something they should pay attention to before they try to take those stupid video games away.  The FBI should be sitting in the audience of every one of these. 
[01:00:00]  Oh my God, you don't know how many fucking collars they can get.  Just videotaping the pedos.  Are you kidding me?  Just jerking off in the audience.  You want to see red dots in one area.  It really is.  Is it red dots on the map?  Yeah, red dots on the Predators.  Fucking just one big red square.  Do you have the song?  Do you have a...  I played the song.  It's actually a song.  Well, it's another song.  Speaking of that song, I tweeted last night on Opie Radio, but the guy playing it has huge ears. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  So if you check out the video, could you tell me if the ears are real?  Could you maybe show Anthony?  Huh?  You think they're fake ears?  I don't know.  The guy singing that creepy song we just played has really, really big ears.  What's his name?  I don't know shit about him.  Hmm.  Yeah, right there.  Oh.  Sorry.  Danny's working on it.  And then we get the real song, too. 
[01:01:00]  I think we've played the real song before.  Maybe they have it down the hall for us.  Oh, maybe we did.  It's...  He's so creepy.  This is the video of what we just played.  Those look like real ears.  Get the fuck out of here.  We're looking at ears that are at least two to three times the size of a normal ear.  That is crazy.  So they...  Did they show them from the side of the floor?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll show them in a second.  Oh, they look fake, though.  I will fuck you in the morning.  Yeah.  Fuck you late at night.  Fuck you while they move.  Or the sun is shining bright. 
[01:01:30]  They're a different color than the rest of his head.  Yeah?  All right.  Yeah.  Well, then...  I want to fuck you.  Hey, it's catchy.  It's very catchy.  Now we've got to get the song that Anthony's talking about.  Yeah, this is the one that the guys sing.  And he is like the worst.  He was trying to coach one of the girls on one of the shows.  And he goes, here's what she'll do.  She'll be a chimney sweep.  A chimney sweep.  And after that, she'll take the chimney sweep clothes off and have a yacky doodle dandy. 
[01:02:00]  And she'll go from being a street person to Broadway.  And he just...  What the fuck?  He was so flaming.  Right.  So flaming.  He's great.  Yeah, I don't know why they don't pay attention to this thing that's going on.  Little Miss Perfect song?  What do you got?  Yeah.  Here he goes.  Where all your dreams come true.  Yeah, listen to him.  Little Miss Perfect pageant. 
[01:02:30]  Where the special one is you.  You don't want to be the special one.  There's a dream of the rainbows on the other side.  On your magic carpet and take a ride.  A wild ride, I bet.  If you think it and you want it.  You want it.  Dream it that it's real. 
[01:03:00]  The kids are looking at him like, what the fuck is this?  You are what you feel.  I'm a big Uncle Dick.  We should play, I'm Honey.  Oh, God.  I'm Honey.  I'm Honey.  That was from the...  That was on regular radio, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  Let's go to Junior Anthony on Long Island. 
[01:03:30]  His sister was one of these pageant queens.  Oh, yeah?  Junior, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  That's Adam Arang.  I'm 24 years old, and since my sister was about four or five, I want to say, my fucking  mom always enrolled her in these stupid little pageant queen things, and she did exactly what  you guys are describing.  She would stick her ass out on stage and shit. 
[01:04:00]  My mom would dress her up in just this scampiest, disgusting outfit, and now she's on the street  doing drugs.  There you go.  There you go.  Nice.  There you go.  Successful story.  There's our first one.  Totally exploited her.  Feel good story right there.  There you go.  If anyone else has a story, please call.  And by the way, if you've seen my sister, please let me know, because we haven't seen her  in months.  Oh, that's wonderful.  That's good.  There you go.  Who do you blame?  Punch out.  Who do you blame, Junior? 
[01:04:30]  I blame my mother.  There you go.  I like this Junior guy.  See, it's...  Keeps it honest.  It's like, you know, well, another good story that came out of that, the JonBenet Ramsey  story.  That was another beauty queen fucking dresser like a whore, and apparently someone couldn't  take it.  I was going to say, it seems like someone got confused.  Someone got a little mixed up at the old Ramsey house.  All right, we're going to take a break, Ant.  We got a busy show today.  We got Robert Kelly coming in in about a half hour. 
[01:05:00]  Bobby.  He'll be the first one here.  Then we got Gary Coleman calling the show today.  I'm going to go for two hours.  I'm going for two hours today.  What?  Gary Coleman.  I'm going to try it for two hours.  Oh, you're going to try it.  Okay.  And we also have Gallagher in studio, hence all the plastic all over the studio.  Yeah.  To want the little girls on Travis has.  No.  Well, let's just hear like the first.  Okay.  Okay.  We'll tell you when to cut it.  This is what we're going to do.  Oh, no. 
[01:05:30]  Ant and I are going to play, uh, what's our line?  Oh, tap out?  Yeah.  Let's see who taps out.  Okay.  You use.  As soon as you.  What?  All right.  You use.  You use the horn.  I'll use the bell.  When we're ready to tap out.  I'm using the horn?  Yeah.  I hope he just threw the horn on the floor.  No, see.  This is your game, pal.  See, by tap out, I don't mean, uh, uh, we can't handle the vocals. 
[01:06:00]  I'm saying we keep our job.  Okay.  Let's see.  As soon as you hear Anthony play the bell, Travis, you've got to stop this.  Yes.  Because that's when, uh, Anthony has to tap out to save our jobs.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Keep it right on the finger on the trigger.  Oh, we're going the live version?  I'm stepping out of the way.  I see a little girl of eight, a man of ten.  I can't resist the urge to stick in my phone.  What?  What?  It didn't even make. 
[01:06:30]  12 seconds.  It didn't even make 12 seconds.  What?  What's wrong with you?  That's the live version, too.  That was in front of a couple thousand people.  That was.  Now, can you start it from there?  Can you just start?  I have it paused, so.  Okay.  Okay.  Like, start it from there.  All right.  Let's see how long you can go now.  And let's see how long.  Because that's just the intro.  Okay.  That wasn't even the song.  Inside of them, because I'm horny for little girls. 
[01:07:00]  For little girls have a hairless little.  What?  What?  What's wrong with you?  All right.  This is satellite radio, Anthony.  What's wrong with you?  This is part of the most offensive song contest.  What is wrong with you?  Many years ago.  And boy, was that an offensive one.  Wow.  Why don't we try one more time? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God.  One more time.  All right.  Can you start it from there?  All right.  Let's see if we can just start it from there.  All right.  I'm horny for little girls.  Oh, I get them high on alcohol and pot.  Their little butts surround so tight and shiny.  It makes you want to stash your junk.  Wait. 
[01:08:00]  What?  Come on.  I know.  It rhymes with shiny.  Come on.  I like how the guy's doing his best impression of, who was that?  Chevalier?  I don't know who the fuck.  God damn.  Is that horrible?  That was on regular radio.  That was on regular radio.  And now we're scared to play it on satellite radio.  And the KKK song.  We have, wow. 
[01:08:30]  We have lived through some shit.  Oh, man.  Camp Concentration was another one.  Mm-hmm.  Imagine.  Imagine.  Imagine was a good one.  Imagine.  The Baby Rafer.  That was one of the most.  Did that one win?  Which one actually won?  I think that was.  It was Baby Rafer.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember now.  Somebody out there would remember.  They remember better than we do.  KKK can. 
[01:09:00]  Right, right.  Right, right, right.  Hanging from the right.  God damn, was that a bad one.  Regular radio, motherfucker.  Camp Concentration was my favorite.  That was a go.  Welcome to Camp Concentration.  That was like an up number.  How do we all know the songs?  Like it was yesterday.  Because they were so catchy.  It was so catchy.  All right, we should break.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  You sure you don't want to play that song? 
[01:09:30]  No, I'm fine with how far we went.  Like I said, I know it rhymes with shiny.  All right, where's Kenny?  I need coffee.  Or is he getting gas?  He could be getting some petroleum products.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you get coffee around here?  I've got to figure that out.  Coffee!  I drink four cups every morning, and I don't even know how to do it myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Are you looking at some more of this song?  Yeah, I forgot about this one.  I have a feeling that it's stuck in the middle with you. 
[01:10:00]  Right, stuck in the middle.  But it's stuck in an oven with juice.  Oh, God.  I don't remember that one.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know what this one is.  It's called Cox on a Nun.  Oh, that's Band on the Run.  I remember that one.  I don't remember that one.  Cox on a Nun.  Cox on a Nun.  And then, look at that.  The KKK song right there.  There's a Brother Joe song that's highly inappropriate these days.  Oh, yeah.  Just Poned My Daughter. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was the daughter.  Yeah, a little Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  Parody.  And Oh, Mine Fjord.  Yeah.  Wait, there's one on there.  I got to remember.  There was one that was really.  Oh, and Stephen Lynch doing.  You know what?  Do you.  He hates when we play it, but we got to do it to him.  You got Stephen Lynch doing FBA live.  FBA.  This should pop up.  I think we could do that.  Going into break.  It was part of our most offensive song contest.  And then we did it in front of like a couple thousand people. 
[01:11:00]  It was an insane party.  They all knew the lyrics.  That was one of the.  What a touching.  That was one of the better ones.  It was haunting.  Christ.  We might have it in the system.  No, Travis?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I got it.  You want the live version?  Yeah, we'll go to break with this.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  I don't usually do cover songs, but this one.  This one's very special to me.  So I brought the one of the co-authors of FBA, Mike DiNicola. 
[01:11:30]  Mike DiNicola.  Mike has been kind enough to write a little extension to the song.  So if you listen closely, you might hear some things you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight.  Sarcoma popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth and all of my friends.  Looks like this time I'm nearing the end of your days. 
[01:12:00]  No need to lie, no reason to fear.  When you're flat on your back, counting all your ribs.  I went to give blood, they just showed me the door.  I stood up to leave, and I fell on the floor full-blowning.  Everybody now.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Damn that whore.  Let's break it down now.  Mike DiNicola's going to do a little spoken word.  A little poetry.  Because I know you guys can appreciate some good poetry, right?  Well, the FBA has set in, and he's left feeling a little low.  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good. 
[01:13:00]  So I'm going to go out and share it with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress, here's your tip.  That ain't acne above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave?  Yeah, that's okay.  I've got time to kill, maybe two or three days.  I'm sitting alone humming the song.  I start to think about everyone who's done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  My fifth grade teacher. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're going to find a hypodermic in your neck.  Patrons in my restaurant.  What about them?  The tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that ain't half and half in your stew.  Oh!  And Wendy.  You remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah.  She stood me up for prom.  But I won't infect her.  You won't infect her?  I'm going to infect her mom.  Her mom? 
[01:14:00]  Still blown AIDS.  Damn that whore!  Damn that whore!  You little fucking whore!  You little fucking whore!  Yeah, you little fucking whore!  Yeah!  FBA!  Obie and Anthony today. 
[01:14:30]  Let's not forget, Jim Norton's going to be on Jay Leno tonight.  Oh, that's right.  This Jay Leno is basically stealing Norton away from us.  I know.  I mean, come on, it's obvious.  The writing's on the wall.  Goddamn prick.  You get the email yesterday?  Which one?  Jay wants Jimmy next week, too.  Really?  Yes.  It's so over.  Who are you kidding?  Jay loves Jim Norton. 
[01:15:00]  Jimmy's a popular guy.  And he should love Jim Norton.  I hear when Norton's on, the ratings spike.  Yeah?  And NBC is loving that fact.  Probably why.  So they're saying more Norton.  Give him a damn show, then.  Give him like his own show.  Norton?  Yeah.  Yeah, then we could do a little something-something for Norton's show.  Exactly.  We got Bob Kelly.  He's going to be here in about 15 or 20 minutes.  It's been a long time.  Bobby.  But if you follow him on Twitter, it seems like yesterday, because he's always... 
[01:15:30]  He's always Twittering his kids.  He's a horrible tweeter.  Yeah, he's...  I'm not saying I'm the best out there.  Certainly not.  His tweets are dull.  They are, right?  Yeah.  There's no real payoff.  No.  It's like, hey, I'm going to be here.  I'm like, all right.  Doing O&A tomorrow.  Well, there you go.  That's nice.  New York City this week.  Gotham Comedy Club.  He has that.  Wait.  And that's fine, too.  Because, you know, they've got to promote their stuff.  Yeah, that's fine. 
[01:16:00]  They don't have a radio show, so they've got to promote any way they can.  So I have no problem with that, either.  Let me, like, follow up.  Boston Garden was insane last night.  I can't believe I play the Garden.  Well, that's good.  That's not bad, either.  I think he's...  He's psyched about it.  That's cool.  New Year's Eve in Boston with Dane Cook, right?  Yeah.  So...  You know what?  I guess they're not as bad.  About to sit down with my grandfather, who is about to turn 100, going to do a Q&A video.  You have any questions?  See, stop it. 
[01:16:30]  What?  Well, where's the video?  Did he ever post the video?  I guess so.  Well, where?  Maybe that's it.  The link.  About to...  All right.  What does it say?  About to sit down with my grandfather, who is about to turn 100.  Going to do a little Q&A video.  You have any questions you want to ask a man who has lived a century.  Send them to me.  It might make the video.  Serious questions only.  No dumb dickhead questions.  Okay, a couple dickhead questions will be all right, but only if they're funny. 
[01:17:00]  So where's the video?  He must have shot it.  All right.  We'll have to ask him about that.  And I take it back.  I mean, those tweets weren't bad.  They were fine.  Whatever.  Huh?  Not good.  And also, we got Gary Coleman coming in.  Coming in?  No.  Unfortunately.  Right.  He's going to be on the phone.  He's not.  Yeah.  I was thinking watermelons and Gallagher.  Yeah.  I could have went with the racist.  Of course.  Vegetable.  Gary Coleman will be on the phone? 
[01:17:30]  You know the movie yet?  No.  I'm seeing it in front of me, and I have no recollection that Gary Coleman talked to us about this movie.  And now it's out on DVD.  So he's calling to promote that fact.  Oh, Jesus.  He's like, okay, look, I was looking away from the screen.  I just looked at the sheet.  I swear to God, as I read Midgets vs. Mascots, I don't remember.  And what is it?  I look at the name, and I have no idea what it's about.  We talked to him about it.  I know.  I don't know.  It took third place in the Tribeca Film Festival. 
[01:18:00]  What?  So where the fuck could you see this?  Do you have to buy the DVD just to see it now?  In the Audience Awards at Tribeca.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  That's probably not third place at the Tribeca Film Festival.  It's just one of the categories.  In the Audience Awards at Tribeca.  All right, here we go.  Gary hates doing the movie and is pissed that there is a scene that shows his penis.  Wow.  All right, we'll ask him about that.  Midgets vs. Mascots. 
[01:18:30]  Is a Borat meets...  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  There it is.  We know about movies like this.  Oh, the hardcore fans understand that.  We're not a big fan of the Meats concept.  Midgets vs. Mascots is a Borat meets Jackass shockumentary.  Shockumentary?  Five little people and five mascots battle for $1 million in a competition like how Fez insults does... 
[01:19:00]  What?  Who typed this?  Who typed this?  Sam Roberts.  How...  Sam Roberts?  How F-E-S insults does it take to get punched in a bar?  How...  It's not many.  How few?  How few?  Where's the S?  It might have been how few...  Is the S in here the W?  Yes, it is.  Okay.  Yes.  Wow, you do that too?  With text messages that come in?  I look and go, where the fuck was that? 
[01:19:30]  All right, I can see he tripped up.  All right, how few insults does it take to get punched in a bar and alligator wrestling?  Gary Coleman leads the little people and ends up getting in to fistfights with mascots, coaches, and Scottie Pippen.  Holy shit.  I'm thinking not quite real.  Of course not.  Gary played Arnold Jackson on different strokes from 78 to 86, by the way. 
[01:20:00]  He was married.  Yeah.  To appear on the show Divorce Court to help their marriage.  Sued his parents for over 3.8 million.  He was charged with assault in 98 for punching a woman while he was working as a security guard.  And apparently, you know, asked for an autograph, and one of the two argued, she mocked his career, so he punched her. 
[01:20:30]  He is an angry little fuck.  He really is.  I couldn't see him punching anyone now.  He's a little frail.  He is a little frail.  He's got some issues.  He's a little ashy.  All right, so Gary's calling him.  And then we got Gallagher, and we're kind of hoping that we can get a little air in this studio, because the plastic is definitely taking effect.  It's like a greenhouse effect in here.  Plastic up everywhere.  And I guess they're going to have a wall of plastic.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  We're going to have to go into this bubble of plastic.  We're going to be like bubble boys in there with Gallagher as he smashes stuff.  They're going to put a curtain of plastic in front of us, so none of the console and equipment get any gack on it.  Are you going to go into the bubble with Gallagher?  Why would I do that and get covered with shit?  I'll watch him through the fucking...  Look at our clothes.  Who gives a shit?  I have a nice...  Is that a nice shirt?  No, I really don't have nice stuff on, but...  All right, so we got a...  Looks like G.I. Joe again.  What do you want? 
[01:21:30]  What is this Australian KFC at all about?  Is this the actual ad?  I think so, yeah.  That's racist.  You read up on this one, right?  Oh, yeah, please.  I read about it a while back on a website I visit.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Something you read on that website went mainstream?  Well, a lot of it goes mainstream, but they switched that website up a little.  I think they had to bow under to some pressure.  From who?  I don't know, but they took a lot of... 
[01:22:00]  It's the N-word, mania.com.  And, you know, don't spell out the N-word.  It's the actual word.  But, yeah, somehow they took down a lot of videos that were up there and changed around  some of the subject headings on the chat room.  Are they trying to get advertising?  Maybe they need...  Maybe they're going for advertising.  Can you imagine?  They're sitting around going, you know, if we just change this up a little bit, we could 
[01:22:30]  get some sponsors.  Hey, we got some money coming in here.  We're getting some traffic.  I think we could get some blue chip companies advertising on our site.  Harumph, harumph, harumph.  That'll work.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I would like to know what that's about.  Yeah, I know.  All right, well, I got...  I don't know what this audio is in front of me.  I should have listened to it.  I'm pretty sure it's the actual audio.  It's only 14 seconds?  Sam, what do you got?  It's the N. 
[01:23:00]  It is the N?  It's only 14 seconds?  Yeah, I mean, I guess on TV, it's one of those 15-second commercials.  Okay.  Where is it from?  Australia.  See, they do 15-second commercials there, I guess.  Which is smart.  Got to get back to Skippy the Bush Kangaroo in reruns.  They laughed at me when I suggested that back when we were at N.E.W.  15-second commercials.  Yeah, I'm like, why don't we just change the whole thing up?  Why does a sponsor need 60 seconds?  Because most of the 60 seconds is just filler.  Why can't we hit them hard with 15-second ads? 
[01:23:30]  Because it got to a point where we had too many ads every hour.  Yeah.  We were drowning in ads.  Silly.  Here it is.  Yeah, Tipton is stuck in an awkward situation.  Too easy.  KSC's crowd pleaser.  A huge variety of delicious chicken and plenty of tasty sides.  I don't know what that's about.  Well, it's playing in front of you.  Oh, my God.  Wait, so what happens? 
[01:24:00]  Now, hold on.  There's a white guy in the stands.  Right.  He's surrounded by black people.  Right.  That's where that music is coming, the steel drums.  Yeah, the steel drums and everything.  And then what he does, he's looking around like, oh, he puts his face in his hands like,  oh, what am I going to do?  And then he holds up a bucket of chicken, and all the black people grab chicken, and now  everybody's cool.  And that's why he says, too easy.  Like, this was a no-brainer. 
[01:24:30]  Too easy.  He's like, too easy.  I know.  So.  I know how to see this for a negro.  So we're not allowed to acknowledge that black people like chicken?  Well, I think it's a generalized statement.  Black people love chicken.  Patrice has said it.  A lot of people have said it over the years.  I go to a lot of Islander games, and one night I was stuck in traffic, so I decided to  take an alternate route, and I went down, what is it, Hempstead Turnpike, Gantt?  You know that area, right? 
[01:25:00]  Of course.  Wow.  I saw within two miles, and you could do it yourself, at least a dozen chicken joints.  Could you find?  With names I've never heard of before.  I mean, they had the biggies, the KFC and the Popeyes.  They've candy fried.  What?  Kennedy fried chicken.  Kennedy fried chicken.  Kennedy fried chicken.  They got it.  There's actually a few.  I know Kennedy fried chickens.  Kennedy fried chicken.  It's like a ripoff, but it's franchised, because I've seen it in a few places.  It's like KFC.  They got it in New Rock City. 
[01:25:30]  They kind of have a bunch of stuff, like where it's fried chicken, they have slices of pizza.  Yeah.  I think they probably have tacos and some Mexican food.  See, I want to find the video of the people that were complaining about the Popeyes giveaway.  Well, yeah.  That was a good...  Now, that's a funny goddamn...  That's some funny fucking audio right there.  It was when the news only spoke with black people.  Well, it's because that's all that was online. 
[01:26:00]  Well, that's what we're presented with.  And they were very, very upset...  They weren't getting their free chicken.  That they weren't getting their free chicken.  I think that's on YouTube.  What's wrong with this ad, though?  Well, because it makes it so that...  The black people agreed to do it.  Yeah, but he's like...  It's almost like, oh my God, there's tigers after me.  Let me just throw some raw meat.  Right.  But the black people went with it?  Well, those...  They could have said no.  Those black people did.  They could have said this is outrageous and racist and not signed up for the commercial.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  But, you know...  It's dehumanizing.  Ant, do you have a little problem with that one?  Some people...  Yeah, yeah.  I have a problem with that.  For real?  I do.  But it's Australia.  I don't know what goes on down there.  Maybe there's second-class citizens down there still.  It's offensive.  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, there are less black people in Australia, but still, there's no reason to treat them  as less than.  Danny, could you please find that one?  Why are they less than?  The Popeyes.  Because they're enjoying some chicken for free.  Well, because it's...  In the stands.  And it's calming them down.  It portrays that a white person... 
[01:27:00]  Free chicken.  Yeah, we're getting the free chicken.  Run out.  But, Dan, I'm trying to understand this.  It makes black people look like...  But you got black people.  It makes them...  They decided to be in this ad.  Yeah.  They knew what the ad was about.  And the chicken is calming them down.  It makes them look...  What's the problem?  Simple.  Like, less than.  No, it makes them look like they really like chicken.  Let's see if this one says...  No human being is that unreasonable.  Yeah.  Let's see if this is the news one.  Fast food chain Popeyes became a victim of its own advertising today. 
[01:27:30]  So many customers lined up for a big special.  Some locations, including one in Penfield and the city, ran out of chicken.  Uh-oh.  Tonight, customers were clucking their disapproval.  Uh-oh.  Customers at the drive-thru heard this recorded message.  I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but we are all out of chicken, and we are closed for  the rest of the day.  Thank you, and have a blessed day.  One woman yelled back at the machine.  For that, people's having kids that they're trying to feed for the special, and you mean 
[01:28:00]  to tell me that we can't feed our kids?  Because y'all didn't order enough chicken.  Y'all knew y'all was having the special almost two months ago.  And that's wrong, but no one was listening.  Now, it's radio, obviously, so people are just hearing the audio out there.  Sounds like she's a woman down on our luck.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Maybe living off the government.  Could be.  She's got a need.  She's in a beautiful Escalade.  She's in a nice, big, black SUV.  She's in a sick-ass, looks like an Escalade. 
[01:28:30]  She's got to feed a key.  Or something similar.  And she's got some fine clothes on.  So she's got a giant expedition.  So she's not in a desperate situation to feed her kids.  No, she's got to feed her kids.  You know about this special?  Her kids like Popeye's.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe the kids were promised a Popeye's dinner.  All right, look, maybe they just...  Look, an Australian, sit in the stands.  Get your kids in the stands.  There's just white guys out there doing the right thing.  Make a white guy nervous.  Maybe that was just a fluke.  Maybe that was one person, a fluke. 
[01:29:00]  Let's not go with a stereotype here, okay?  All right.  Woman yelled back at the machine.  For that, we was having kids, and they're trying to feed for the special.  And you mean to tell me that we can't feed our kids?  Designer sunglasses.  He got out and ordered enough chicken.  Branding car.  I knew y'all were having the special almost two months ago.  And that's warm.  But no one was listening.  The Popeye's on Lake Avenue was closed by dinnertime.  Are you kidding me?  I think that's bad, because I'm sure I'm hungry.  No chicken.  No chicken? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, they just had a chicken.  I said, I'm calling the customer service now.  Oh, there's another Popeye's there.  They always run out of food.  Six black guys.  Six black people in a row.  Magic, chasing, gravy, coles.  They always run out of something.  It's very disappointing.  I wanted some chicken to do.  Other locations ran out of chicken, too.  Oh, no location.  $4.99 special.  Too good to pass on.  This is different.  I just left pencil on my ice.  They were out of chicken there, so I ran to the city with this one in there uptown.  You can't find one white person?  Really?  This is ridiculous.  They should have had a stockpile of chicken for this day. 
[01:30:00]  They should have had a tax return on back.  Eight, nine.  With extra chicken on ice, you know?  Maybe it was the economy that caused the rush on chicken.  Yeah.  At that price and just being made, you know, that is a good deal.  Isn't that sad?  Eleven.  Eleven.  People trying to spend money.  They don't want it.  I was trying to leave my family tonight.  Can't get that bucket in now.  Customers felt duped.  I'm never coming back now.  I'm serious.  I'm done.  They got to get their stuff together.  You know, they put their advertisements on and then they don't show up for it. 
[01:30:30]  I'm more disappointed than angry.  You know, we've been looking forward to this day.  They advertise it on national TV.  How you going to run out of chicken?  That's all I have to say.  Let me get it.  Jesus.  Angry customers there.  Popeye says the franchises are individually owned for and responsible for ordering their own chicken.  Exactly.  They raise this news channel.  Look, every single person they talked to was an African American. 
[01:31:00]  Every single person they broadcast.  That led me to believe.  That's brave, though, because most news outlets would not do it that way.  They would throw in the token white guy.  Try to find one.  I'm sure there were.  This is a news network that is trying to paint a picture.  When the chicken places run these free chicken promotions, it is...  And I could go with 20 different analogies of what it looks like, but I'll just ring the bell. 
[01:31:30]  I would go to a chicken special, and I would not be interviewed.  Well, you would not go.  Would you go to a chicken special for real?  Of course.  I know they don't pay you around here, but...  Exactly.  And I would like to, you know, feed the family.  What are they going to pay you?  Get that bucket in.  I don't know.  Get that bucket in.  Nah, I can't get that bucket in.  I want to get that bucket in.  Exactly, but they wouldn't interview you, because then they're...  God damn it, I want some Popeyes right now.  How about you go to the fucking store, buy some fucking chicken, and cook it for your  fucking kids? 
[01:32:00]  Because you wouldn't get that bucket in from Popeyes.  Yeah, well, you know...  It tastes different.  Obviously, they ran out.  They didn't have it.  You've got to improvise, adapt, overcome.  How about you go to the fucking store, buy some fucking chicken, and cook it for your  kids, and have a fucking dinner with your kids that isn't an 8 billion calorie fucking  fat fest.  Because you've got to get your bucket in.  Exactly.  Right, I didn't understand that.  There's a Popeyes special day.  They're talking to their kids, saying, we're going to have Popeyes dinner on Tuesday.  Yay!  And the kids know it's Popeyes day. 
[01:32:30]  And if you call this show in the near future, please let us know if you got your bucket  in or not.  Yeah, did you get your bucket in?  I really need to know how many people are getting their bucket in.  Did you get your bucket in?  I got my bucket in over the weekend.  Oh, did you?  I went to Popeyes.  Dude, imagine that woman when she went home, what her kids must have been like, like, she  must have been...  I couldn't get the bucket in.  What, mama?  Let me ask you something.  Yeah?  Is there anything better than a bucket when you're dealing with a horrendous hangover?  Oh, it's a little greasy. 
[01:33:00]  There's nothing.  Better.  Just at the point when you can start eating without puking.  A bucket of KFC when you're suffering?  Yeah, that is some good stuff.  There is nothing better.  But I will say that news clip is not evidence that black people...  No?  No?  I mean...  Find another one.  Sam, hold on.  More importantly, why is the Australian one racist?  Because it dehumanizes...  I don't understand.  Because it dehumanizes the black actors on that commercial and portrays black people as 
[01:33:30]  a community of people who are simple and easy to manipulate as long as you have a bucket  of chicken.  A bucket of chicken.  And then you're in the clear.  We've all been in a situation where you want to calm the people around you.  And if it's going to take a bucket of chicken, why not?  Because they don't portray white people as being simple enough to be calmed down with  fried foods.  They certainly do.  White people, especially white males, are portrayed as the simplest people on television  and commercials.  Yep.  Indeed.  Yep.  It's amazing to see Australia doing something a little controversial like that. 
[01:34:00]  Let me say hi to Robert in North Carolina.  We're going to go deeper into the story here.  Robert?  Hey, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I got my bucket in.  How on that?  I just wanted to point out that I think Australians are all racist.  You remember a couple months ago the story about a talent show with blackface and Harry  Connick Jr. had to like yell at him?  Oh, yeah.  I got a high horse.  Sure.  But that's all I got.  Punch it out.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  Thank you, sir.  Well, the Australians have a different thing.  Oh, my God.  She's riding a fucking mechanical bull.  You know what that looks like.  The Australians have a whole different thing with their racism, you know?  Mm-hmm.  They just do.  It's not.  Americans, we look at it differently because of slavery and stuff like that.  We're covert.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're out in the open with their racism.  Everybody want to piece of my chicken.  Southern fried chicken.  Finger lick it.  Fried that chicken. 
[01:35:00]  Fried that chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Again, not evidence that that is an appropriate commercial.  No?  No.  Let's say hi to Pat and Philly.  Pat.  Hello, boys.  Hello, Pat.  Nobody said Oprah Winfrey was racist when she gave out coupons in her old magazine for fried chicken last year.  Sorry.  We're watching Anthony's ex ride a mechanical bull.  She's on a mechanical bull and she's ready to fall off.  Did she fall off your arm?  Oh, I remember that scene. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She fell off the bull.  Dude, she's looking real good today.  Make that call.  I am.  You got to get that breakup sex in.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's looking real good.  She just put Danny's hat on.  That's a sign.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You think that's a signal?  Yeah.  She's taking a peek at what you're up to.  That hat means she wants to break up sex.  Yeah, man.  Pat, Oprah was racist or something? 
[01:36:00]  No, no.  It's a double standard when a black person can give away coupons for chicken.  Okay.  You don't have to give away coupons in a magazine.  It's not the same as dehumanizing a race of people in a commercial.  No one's dehumanizing them.  Jesus Christ.  You guys are lighting up a little bit.  Sam, why don't we do a social experiment?  I want you to get a bucket.  Okay.  And I want you to go to an area that might have a bus stop. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  And let's see if this Australian freaking commercial is the real deal or not.  No, I don't think that our mission as a show should be to prove the commercial right.  Why?  You can't just say it's wrong.  Let's see if it's wrong.  I'm all about seeing if something's wrong.  Yeah.  Not just saying it.  What does that mean?  I guess so.  We need a place where Sam could go where they might be a bit surly.  Uh-oh.  And get them excitable and then order the chicken to come in. 
[01:37:00]  No, they're already excitable.  I don't know where they hang out where they're excitable right now.  And then you come in there and you look...  We have to stop saying they and them.  You look way out of place.  Right.  But you have a chicken.  Well, you can't have the bucket exposed.  No, no, no.  It's got to be covered.  It's cold in New York, so you could wear a big coat.  And then when things get really crazy and you're like, oh my God, I'm in this situation,  then you pull out the bucket.  Pull it out, see if it works like the Australian commercial.  But what happens if it doesn't?  It should, right? 
[01:37:30]  No, is what I'm saying.  Huh?  I think so.  I don't think it'll work and I will probably be in danger.  You won't be in danger.  Oh my God, that's racist.  Why would you say they're in...  You said everybody's going to get out of control.  No, they're already out of control.  Like right now, 8 o'clock on a Wednesday morning.  That's so racist.  Where are they?  In bed.  Oh Jesus, I don't even know what's going on anymore.  I don't know.  Maybe they work here now.  I don't know who they is.  I don't know who they is.  Come on.  Maybe some people are working the night shift.  Why won't you do this social experiment? 
[01:38:00]  Because, first of all, it's got racist, not racial, racist undertones.  All right.  Because you're such a wimp.  Let's calm down the bit slightly.  Okay.  Bucket of chicken.  Okay.  You walk out into Times Square where there's a melting pot of people.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And let's see who goes for the free chicken.  I just say...  That's a good idea.  Like we'll get a table and a bucket and I'll get a sign that says free chicken. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  And then I have to just count.  Yes.  And you come back and give us the numbers.  Free chicken tasting.  Make it sound like a project.  Right.  Or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  That might work.  And wear the sign that Bruce Willis had to wear in Die Hard 2.  I don't think...  I don't think...  No?  I think I will...  Ah, son of a bitch.  Well, we could change the sign.  Come on.  Just have it say...  Well, I don't even know...  Hold on.  I haven't even written the sign yet before you say no. 
[01:39:00]  Well, that's just it.  If you have to write it and can't say it, it's going to be a problem.  Let me just write the sign and show it to Sam and see what he thinks.  Oh, it's Die Hard 3?  Oh, who cares?  How come I always fuck that up?  Die Hard 2 was the one with the airplane.  Alright, Die Hard 3 was the one with Samuel Jackson, right?  Okay, sorry about that.  And Die Hard 4 was the one that was awful.  Awful, right.  I didn't really like any of the Die Hards except the first one.  Maybe, yeah.  That first one kicked ass.  Two was the eye.  With naked bad guy in the hotel room working out. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, that was great.  So, Sam, you're down in Times Square with a bucket of chicken.  Alright, and a sign because people don't know what the fuck is going on.  You know, you've got to have some kind of sign.  What if it said this?  Hey, okay.  Free chicken.  It says get a good one.  Get a good one.  I don't even know if that's...  That's a little Mr. Hand thrown in there.  I know who said it.  You didn't say it.  I know, I remember.  But this...  No, I know.  Would I...  Hey...  Hey...  It just says hey blanks.  Free chicken, get a good one.  Here's the thing.  What?  I don't even know that that's... 
[01:40:00]  I don't think a sign is necessary.  It would just say free chicken tasting.  Yeah.  There's no reason to go further than that.  Yeah.  Hold on one second.  Gary.  Yes?  Gary Coleman, our friend.  Oh, damn.  How you doing, Gary?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Gary, are you busy?  I'm trying to be.  I'm going to be.  I know we're going to promote Midgets vs. Mascots on DVD.  Yes.  But we're going to break here.  Could you hold on?  Yeah, I can go on break.  Do you mind? 
[01:40:30]  Not at all.  All right.  We're going to get back to you right after the break, Gary.  Okay, not a problem.  It's 8.02.  I mean, you're doing the right thing.  You're on time.  But we're running a little late today.  And I apologize in advance.  But if you could hold through the break, that would be great.  Okay, not a problem.  All right.  Gary Coleman after the break, everyone.  What happened?  I'm going for two hours.  Two fucking hours.  Two hours.  Two hours.  He's going to punch you.  Huh? 
[01:41:00]  He's going to punch you.  He fucking hung up on him, too.  I didn't mean to.  I meant to put him on hold.  But if he was on hold, he would have heard us, right?  Yeah.  That's a problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, he'll hear us on hold.  Maybe we could...  No, I mean, when you go to hold here, we could pick him up in there.  Ah, and just leave him kind of hanging with some ambient sound.  Yeah.  As long as he can't hear it.  No, we'll talk to...  We'll talk to Gary after the break.  Don't worry.  Yeah, yeah.  Obviously.  Oh, okay. 
[01:41:30]  This is...  Footer, go ahead.  Footer has a nice little story about free fast food.  Yes, Footer.  Yeah, you know what?  It's funny.  I went...  Once in a while, I had to get a little McDonald's breakfast.  And I saw buy one, get one free.  So I pull in.  I pull up to the little window.  I said, you know, let me get...  You know, let me get buy one, get one.  She goes, sir, there is none left.  I went, you know what?  Not a problem.  I pulled away.  I did nothing.  That's what I did.  I just pulled away.  Didn't go crazy.  Didn't yell.  Look, didn't...  Didn't yell. 
[01:42:00]  Didn't scream.  And real quick, can I start the new bit for the year?  My favorite O&A bit.  Yeah.  Put Velcro on the ceiling.  Punch it out.  Oh, Jesus.  See.  The people at Popeye's were not going crazy.  The news went up to them and said, hey, are you upset?  Hey, da-da-da.  And got them to...  They were a little...  And then the white anchors laughed at them.  A little angry.  Yes.  It's a racist news network.  Sam, let's be honest with each other.  We really don't need you in the studio today.  So could you do the social experiment or not? 
[01:42:30]  Times Square.  Bucket of chicken.  If you need me to.  Bring E-Rock.  But tell him not to eat the fucking...  I can't.  Well, I mean, then this bit's over.  There's no way that chicken would survive.  Let's do this and let's get to the bottom of this.  I want to see who comes up.  Okay.  For the tasting.  We'll need to get a table and a bucket.  It's a little early, but...  Yeah, it is a little early.  Oh, stop it.  Never too early.  For what?  For chicken.  Oh.  For anyone.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Oh, damn it.  Gary? 
[01:43:00]  Yes.  Hey, Gary.  Gary Coleman, everyone.  Hey, how are you?  What happened there?  Sorry, man.  Oh, I think your assistant is not awake yet.  Why?  What happened?  They disconnected us.  Oh, shit.  Sorry about that, Gary.  That's all right.  I'm not upset.  Good friend of the show.  We bonded when you were in here.  Hey, we did the best we could.  And I was kind of bummed that you didn't come back live.  We're doing the phone thing, huh?  Don't worry about that.  Yeah, we had a great time last time you came in. 
[01:43:30]  We really did.  A lot of fun just talking about life in general, things like that.  Yep.  All right.  Just...  Hi, I'm in L.A.  I'm down to see those stupid producers from Midgets vs. Bascots.  Yeah.  Oh.  Going to be on DVD very, very soon.  All right.  They're doing a $1,000 offer of some kind of...  Oh, man.  ...national things.  They're trying to get out these DVDs so that they can make some money.  But...  Yeah.  And it's going to be off. 
[01:44:00]  So I've got to talk to them about that now.  So...  Yeah.  The thing is, we're not...  Yeah.  We're still in frigging break.  These goddamn breaks they make us do.  Yeah.  It's a little nuts.  We're going to talk after the break.  You're doing a lot of these today, Gary?  I don't know.  No.  I'm just doing a bunch.  I'm just trying to get the word out.  Yeah.  All right.  Gary.  Gary.  Yeah.  Gary.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Are you near electronics or something?  That's one of those...  Yeah.  I know that, but...  Phones.  God.  Are you...  Gary.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary Colvin.  Gary.  They've got their phone on.  Bad cell service there in L.A.  Oh, God.  I hate when that happens.  It's usually a cell phone close to the microphone or some of the equipment.  That's weird.  Yeah.  That is weird.  I'm sure he'll call back after the break. 
[01:45:00]  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mike.  Oh, hey.  Long time listener.  First time caller.  Thank you, Mikey.  What do you got?  Hey, I'll tell you a story.  Years ago, we're down at school down in New Orleans, and there was a neighboring fraternity,  and they had set up a chicken social for one of the sororities.  So we went down to the project, and we said that it was a free chicken dinner, the same address,  for anybody who wanted to come starting about a half hour after their social started.  Right. 
[01:45:30]  So they're all standing out on the porch with girls, got nice dresses on, the guys are all  wearing their loafers, two or three busloads of black people show up and take all the chicken.  They had no choice.  They had to give them all the chicken.  It was funny as shit.  You went to a low-income area and offered free food.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Of course.  They had to travel up to get the free food.  Don't make it sound like it's a race thing, sir.  Low-income people will be.  It's a class difference. 
[01:46:00]  Race had nothing to do with it.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  Yeah, but it was funny.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Gary Coleman is calling back.  Gary.  Yes.  God, what the F is going on?  I don't know.  It's gremlins.  No, I'm calling from a hotel.  You're calling from a hotel?  Yeah.  Well, maybe you should use the hotel phone because your cell phone is really, I don't know.  No, I'm calling from the hotel line.  You're calling from the hotel line and we're still getting that weird, like, cell phone static. 
[01:46:30]  You know, if the engineers don't fix this, wow.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary.  Hey, listen.  Where are you right now?  Maybe it's some kind of interference in the hotel.  No, no, no, no.  I need you guys' help on something.  No, I...  I need to get your listeners involved in this.  It's just...  Gary, yeah.  Yes, Gary.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary, where are you sitting in the hotel room right now? 
[01:47:00]  I'm on the phone.  No, I know you're on the phone, but there's some kind of, like, interference.  Like, are you near a TV or something?  No, no.  There's no...  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing?  No, it's nothing.  Listen, I really...  Sometimes the clock radio does that.  Yeah, are you near the clock radio?  Am I what?  Near the clock radio.  In the hotel.  No, no, there's no...  No electronics sharing the wall anywhere. 
[01:47:30]  What are you saying?  In the hotel room.  What the hell is that noise, then?  Do you hear it, Gary?  You know what?  I'll call you back.  All right, please call me back from, like, another line or something, because we have  some weird interference happening.  You got a cell phone or something, maybe?  All right.  I don't know.  It's in versus mascot.com, you guys.  I'll help you.  All right, yeah.  All right.  Who was on the background?  Was that Willis? 
[01:48:00]  I don't think he was with Willis.  Was that Mr. Drummond?  Mr. Drummond.  Why is he hanging out with Mr. Drummond, Sam?  I don't think that was Mr. Drummond.  By the way...  Yes.  While we were on the phone there with Gary Coleman,  I looked at the television.  Yes, you did.  And the news is on, of course.  And they showed a McDonald's.  And a woman was...  Oh, that's the story of the day.  Very upset.  The Chicken McNuggets story?  Nope.  That's the drive-thru one.  There's a new one?  Oh, yeah.  A woman at the counter.  Right. 
[01:48:30]  Very upset, apparently.  Said an inferior burger.  Inferior burger.  And she was very upset and just started picking up things and hurling them behind the counter  at the employees.  Well, that's what you do when you're pissed off, right?  Uh, well, some people.  People with anger issues.  Anger issues.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Obviously, she was a hot-tempered woman.  It just so happened that, well, I...  It just so happened, let's just say.  There was surveillance tape.  Yeah.  So I was watching the surveillance camera view, and I don't get it. 
[01:49:00]  I don't think her ethnicity comes into question here.  I don't think it's relevant.  I just don't understand the anger when it comes to fast food.  I don't understand the anger.  There's plenty of places...  Well, it's called fast food.  You're a little agitated to begin with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At a fast pace.  Oh.  Yeah, hold on.  I don't even know what you're saying, because I was writing a note.  Did it make sense what I just said?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did it? 
[01:49:30]  Did I answer the conversation?  You did a good job.  For real?  Actually, for not listening to the...  Yeah.  All right, because I've done that all the time.  Because I'm trying to...  We're doing two different bits here.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  All right.  Then...  And then...  Steve from Bayshore, let's just say it was a Category 5.  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  There's a certain term that is used when certain people freak out. 
[01:50:00]  Angry people?  Yeah, when certain people get angry.  Oh.  And it goes in categories.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Good.  Gary.  Hey, help me.  Get my penis out of this movie.  Hold on.  Yeah, what the hell's the deal with that, man?  Wait, Gary.  Hey, man.  My penis has never been in a movie.  Gary.  And I'm not about to have anybody assume that...  It shouldn't be.  ...it's my penis.  I haven't even seen this movie.  Gary.  I understand.  We got a good connection now.  I guess we fixed whatever the stupid problem was. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, sorry, man.  But we do have to take a break right now.  Do you mind?  All right.  All right.  All right.  You want me to put you on hold?  Do you want to just call back in about...  How long's the break?  Like 18 minutes?  Something like that.  18 minutes?  Yeah.  That's a hell of a long break there, fellas.  Well, you're talking to a popular show.  We have a lot of ads, Gary.  And we went for, like, two hours without taking a break.  Oh, wait.  Good news.  12 minutes?  Yeah.  12 minutes.  Okay.  They knocked it down to 12.  Is that cool?  All right.  I guess I can call back... 
[01:51:00]  We're going to promote the hell out of this freaking movie for you.  You know that, Gary.  We'd appreciate it, Gary, man.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  And after the break, we talk to Gary Coleman.  There he goes.  Poor bastard.  And, Sam, you're going to do the bucket thing?  Yeah.  I mean, it seems early for the bucket.  Never too early.  Bring Troy or E-Rock.  Okay. 
[01:51:30]  Better.  And videotape it, will you?  All right.  I mean, you do that.  We're going to smash shit in the studio.  You do that.  And then we all come together near the end and find out the results of your little social experiment.  All right.  Under protest, by the way, because I'm going to do it a different way.  Times Square is a safe zone.  I want you to go uptown.  We reached a compromise.  I guess.  Well, time constraints and distance and transit.  Yeah.  We can get back on time.  Yeah.  I just want you walking around yelling, free chicken, free chicken with your bucket. 
[01:52:00]  And see who grabs.  Oh, not like it's set up?  No, because they'll probably get mad down there.  You know how they are down there.  I don't know.  You want to find out about the G-spot from Lydia before break?  Yeah.  Lydia from Oceanside.  Hi, guys.  Usually Lydia calls with that horrendous voice and does psychobabble.  But today you're calling for another reason?  Yes.  I want to congratulate you on the educational format of your radio show.  Why? 
[01:52:30]  Really?  I was listening yesterday and there was all the talk about the G-spot.  And then you played a video, which I did not see, but I did hear.  And I went home and mentioned that I'd like to try it.  And I don't know what those people were saying that it doesn't work.  Wow.  Did we have a great night?  Wow.  Really?  He did the...  The inch of the day off and then off.  Rocking, the rocking out Ronnie James Dio thing. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, you shove your two fucking fingers in that veg.  Middle finger and ring finger in there.  And then you kind of pull up on you like you're taking a bowling ball out of the fucking bowling  ball holder.  But you know what?  We didn't even use fingers.  We used the real thing and it worked great.  Wait a minute.  So he used his dick?  Yes.  And what did he do different?  I didn't go all the way in.  Just stopped about an inch and a half.  And we maneuvered each other so that he was pushing up in that spot. 
[01:53:30]  Maneuver.  It was really unbelievable.  Yeah?  I am not fooling you.  Were those giant tits going in circles?  I'm so lovely.  I love when the giant tits go in circles.  Right.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  If you're in Australia, they rotate the other way.  Yeah, I know.  He's just like toilet water.  Yeah.  I said counterclockwise.  What?  I said counterclockwise instead of clockwise in Australia.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  That rocks.  It worked for Lydia.  There you go.  I suggested everyone try it.  Did you get all wet?  No.  I did not squirt.  Oh, you didn't squirt?  You didn't squirt?  Did you take the cum on your face?  Did I take the cum on my face?  Yeah.  Did he give you a facial?  No.  Oh.  He was inside of me.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You trying to have another kid?  Oh, no.  Twins are enough.  That ain't going to happen.  I understand.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Uh-uh.  Two mothballs for overreaches.  All right.  Thank you, Lydia.  There you go.  Lydia's telling us it works.  I'm just going to...  This is the video from yesterday.  Okay.  The audio's great.  We'll go to break with this audio.  She's so greased up.  That's fucking hot.  Breathe.  That's right.  Breathe all the way to your belly.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:55:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at that.  This is weeks of training.  This isn't the finger technique.  It's the massaging. 
[01:55:30]  That's it.  It continues to go on its own.  It's like a machine.  It cycles and she just has...  Orgasm after orgasm.  Great girl.  Now look at her face.  Look at her face.  Can you get her face in there?  We have to.  Do you feel good?  Look at that beautiful face.  That is your reward.  I have a burger, Jesse. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Now.  Very important piece.  Drink your Gatorade.  What a break.  Fuck the Gatorade.  Letting go of a lot of liquid.  Gallagher next.  Bob Kelly next.  Gary Coleman next.  Stay there.  Ah, wow.  They're putting up more plastic.  We got a busy show.  Opie and Anthony.  We got Gary Coleman on hold.  We're going to get to him in a few minutes to talk about his movie, Midgets vs. Mascots, 
[01:56:30]  on DVD.  On sale now at midgetsvsmascots.com.  And the versus is spelled VS.  And we got Bob Kelly in studio, our old friend, who's been touring with Dane Cook for the  last, I think it left in the fall, right?  I think it left after fly fishing, more or less.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually listened to the replay of that.  That was fucking hilarious.  The fly fishing shit?  Hilarious.  I still love watching those videos.  And we're going again.  I can't wait. 
[01:57:00]  March.  March.  March is cold.  No, March is good.  The crisp air.  Standing in the water.  Go fly fishing with us for the goof.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm not going fly fishing.  For the goof.  No.  Just a bunch of men fly fishing.  No.  Just come on.  Talking to dirty waitresses.  You can shoot the fish.  I would not.  Well, that would be fun.  Oh, that would be.  I think it's highly illegal.  Whoever catches the most fish.  I don't think you could shoot fish.  Yeah, it's highly illegal. 
[01:57:30]  But where we go, no one's going to know.  Yeah.  We'll get you deep into the river.  It's like the river.  The fucking buried Billy Bats.  It's like that.  Honestly, it's kind of creepy up there.  And we're not staying at that same shithole.  It's the only place.  No, there's a million places.  A million.  A million.  Me and you.  Bed and breakfast.  Driving the trouble.  I hate bed and breakfast.  Oh, God.  He stayed to bed and breakfast.  Oh, you wake up at some assholes like, I made cookies.  Hold on. 
[01:58:00]  First of all, I haven't.  Everyone downstairs for breakfast.  I smell bacon cooking.  And you got to go downstairs and talk to some fucking dimwit from fucking Wyoming.  You're absolutely right.  I haven't been to a bed and breakfast in a while.  I went to one in Cape Cod in Hyannisport.  And then I realized that day that these bed and breakfasts are owned by swingers.  Is that what it is?  And that's why they have these fucking things.  Well, now you're fucking piquing my interest.  But that's why.  Fuck that.  I'll suck some guy's wife's pussy.  Very good. 
[01:58:30]  Save yourself there.  Very good.  Save yourself.  I almost slipped.  I'm going to suck.  All right.  That's what you're going to do.  But you're right.  Just like Ann's saying, you come down for breakfast and there's the creep that owns the place with his wife.  And he's showing a little too much and she's showing a little too much.  They got their bathrobes on.  But they, you know what I mean, all of a sudden there's like some peekabooing happening and shit.  I know what's going on.  I wouldn't want to be in anyone's house.  And then all of a sudden, like you're saying, you're sitting at their grimy table having breakfast with another couple from some godforsaken place. 
[01:59:00]  I did one up in upstate New York, way, way, up where you went to college.  Way the fuck up there.  I walked in.  The guy was at the door waiting for me.  He's like, Robert, we've been waiting for you.  Like some creepy cult shit.  And I walk in.  There's around 10 old people having ham.  And they all turned around in unison.  Having ham.  Just eating ham.  Why would you want to do that?  Then he walks by and he goes, this is the game room.  They didn't have a TV.  There's no TVs in the room.  No.  There was a game room.  Why do you want distractions like that? 
[01:59:30]  You want to interact with the people, man.  Yeah, they got chess boards.  The backgammon.  There's nothing better than walking into a hotel and getting still in theaters on the fucking TV.  I love that.  Right up the Wi-Fi.  The computer right in the bed.  All that shit.  I could throw fucking nasty underwear in the garbage because they're so bad.  And you don't have to worry that some bed and breakfast woman's going to go, I washed these for you.  Thinking, oh my God.  You wouldn't do a bed and breakfast, man.  No bed and breakfast for you?  No. 
[02:00:00]  I hate the thought of it.  I tried it.  You got to try this shit.  It's set for a romantic comedy.  Oh, they suck.  Every room is themed.  I was, dude.  The Prince room.  Oh, they suck.  Yeah, this is our leopard room or whatever.  The wicker room.  Yeah, they got dumb names for it.  Everything's white wicker.  I hate wicker.  Wicker's the fucking worst.  It's a dust collecting shit furniture.  I was in one in a wicker, a white wicker bed with a fucking white wicker table and a white wicker chair. 
[02:00:30]  It's creaks and squeaks.  It was like a fly, a huge fly flying over me.  And then I swear to God, I go, this place is haunted.  And when I said that, it died on my chest.  It fell out of the air and died on my chest.  Fucking Amityville Horror stuff there.  Fuck that.  Fucking wicker.  Wicker stinks.  It doesn't look, it's not comfortable.  They try to put some thin fucking, a half inch piece of padding on wood.  Yeah.  You're sitting on fucking vines with a half inch piece of padding on it. 
[02:01:00]  Give me a couch.  All right.  And I don't like the thought that you can't mess the room up and leave it.  I mess a room up a hotel room and then I fucking get up here and clean the room.  Can you at least do it for the show?  I can fly fishing for the show.  Go to a better breakfast for the show.  You'll come back with some stories.  I like jerking off into the face cloth knowing I'll never see that face cloth again. 
[02:01:30]  There you go.  I don't want to jerk off and then the next day it's there again.  The same one.  You know what else?  When I'm home.  With yellow stains on it.  You're right.  I'm not even to that extreme, but I understand that one.  But when you're home and you're washing in the shower and stuff and you take your washcloth  and do your old business and then the undercarriage and stuff like that and then you sit there  with some soap and you make sure the washcloth is cleaned out, right?  Right.  In a hotel, I will fucking scrub my ass, ball, everything and then just take the washcloth 
[02:02:00]  still with the soap in it and go thwop against the wall.  It has hairs from your ass with the root still in it.  It doesn't matter.  It has some big white root at the end of it.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Not my problem.  And you know at a bed and breakfast, they're just throwing those washcloths into a fucking  washing machine for the next couple.  I want to know what the soap was used.  I had to use a community bathroom.  Fuck that.  The soap was used and it was shaped like it was pointed.  So somebody was like washing their asshole to a point. 
[02:02:30]  To a point.  No.  It's shaped like it was used in a shitload of asses.  I want wrapped French milled soap.  Yes.  That's what I want.  Yes.  I want the soap with the wheat in it.  The buckwheat.  Yes.  That scratches your asshole.  Like fucking granola soap.  What the fuck is that?  I hate when I unwrap the soap and it's that.  I just want soap.  I'm not eating here.  There's nothing wrong with like just a strange pube in the shower.  Oh.  Come on.  Fuck that.  There's an afghan on the wall where a plasma should be.  Tapestry.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  Like a quilt.  Get the fuck out of here.  Where's the fucking bomb?  He's been to some bed and breakfast.  I fucking hate them.  I hate.  And I hate.  Let me tell you.  Whose idea?  Your wife?  No.  It was on the road.  Like the, you know, a lot of these gigs you do, these shit gigs.  Hey, we put you in the bed and breakfast.  It's a real nice place.  Chad's a good guy.  Fuck you.  Chad.  Fuck you.  Isn't it always like a Chad?  Chad and Bruce.  I hate being social.  I hate it.  Even when we go on vacation with my wife, I love that we, she doesn't like talking to  anybody.  I hate those people at the airport.  Hey, how you doing?  Where you staying? 
[02:03:30]  No.  I'm staying at the, uh, the, the, the, um, fucking flip-flop in.  Yeah.  I don't need to tell you.  Where's that?  It's down the end of the beach on the fucking hut near the fucking river.  What?  I'm not fucking hanging out with you and having dinner or fucking talking to other couples.  I hate that.  I don't need to shit chat with people that I don't know.  Exactly.  Because you have to lie.  That's why.  Because how you doing?  I'm fucking terrible.  Yeah.  That's what you want to say.  Let me tell you.  I'm good.  Where you from?  Boston.  New York.  I live in New York.  Eat your ham.  Do it for the show.  Uh-uh. 
[02:04:00]  A bed and breakfast.  No.  We'll find one near a casino.  I don't.  Give me a five-star fucking hotel in Manhattan.  That's what I'm talking.  We're not going to get good stories out of that.  Room service.  How do we get good stories out of that?  Good story.  I don't need a good story.  I need a good night's sleep and a good movie, good food.  You can just trash the room and hear the 20 to the maid and just smiles.  I've had them call up and be like,  Hi, Mr. Kermia, you haven't had room, sir? 
[02:04:30]  You haven't had your room cleaned in four or five days?  You want any housekeeping?  No, I'm fine.  Do you need towels?  No.  Go away.  I'm a huge fan of the corner.  It's a wreck when I leave.  I'm a huge fan of, yeah, getting the room cleaned every other day if you're gone for a week.  Yeah, but what are you doing in there?  I'm flipping fucking beer caps.  I swear to God, I do.  I open a beer and wham, I'm flipping it at the windows, at the TV. 
[02:05:00]  You're opening it on the desk, just slamming the beer on the top of the desk.  I don't give a shit.  You're an animal.  You get the corner of the bed sheet.  It shows the actual mattress.  Oh, I eat like dinner in bed and it's just spaghetti sauce and shit going all over the place.  I'm a slob.  Don't you have a famous story, I think we told it on the air, where you passed out with a fruit plate on you or something?  Yeah, I was fucking, it was one of my drinking binges and I was staying at...  Didn't someone find you with a fruit plate on you?  I was staying at Le Parc Meridian and I ordered the fruit plate, which is just fantastic. 
[02:05:30]  Cantaloupe, honeydew, melon.  But it's a massive fruit plate.  You can eat it all day long.  So, I'm watching some fucking, still in theaters, great movie.  I got the fruit plate on my stomach and I'm just laying there eating.  Next thing I know, I wake up and I have like fucking kiwi fruit stuck to my nipples and strawberries on my side.  I was rolling around in fruit all over the bed. 
[02:06:00]  I've done that.  Yeah, just pass out eating.  I did that with the...  You ever just jump on the bed with the chocolate still in it and you wake up and listen to shit the bed?  Yeah, I've done that too.  You just got fucking mushy chocolate all over the fucking pillow.  Yeah, ever have it on the side of your face?  Yeah.  Why do you have to put the fucking thing on a pillow?  Jesus.  Put it on the nightstand, I'll find it.  That's great, fuckers.  I don't need turndown service, I don't need this, that, I don't... 
[02:06:30]  I like turndown.  Give me the fucking...  Why?  I like that.  Pull the fucking spread down and get in.  Why do you need...  What is turndown service?  They come in and they fucking make sure you got a couple towels.  I got towels.  My favorite, you check in, you get to your room, you're exhausted because you've been traveling all day.  You're like, you know what, I'm going to take a fucking nap and I'll be fresh as it gets easy for the rest of the day.  And just as you fall asleep, the phone rings.  They have to make sure you're doing okay.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  I mean, La La Land. 
[02:07:00]  I got that too.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I got this too.  Amenities.  Amenities?  The fuck is that?  Oh, that guy.  Get the fuck in.  Oh, dude.  The guy that refills the mini bar.  The bar brings you like a welcome back little champagne bottle or something or some fruit or some shit.  One, two.  Click.  The door's open.  You couldn't fucking make it to the door.  You got to be standing there with your hand on the doorknob. 
[02:07:30]  When you have the security.  The case, you're like, someone's breaking in.  Fuck.  Amazing.  Bed and breakfast.  How was the tour?  I jerk off so much in those things, the hotels.  I jerk off so much.  I can't help but jerk off in a hotel.  I actually got kicked off the internet thing in some fancy hotels.  If you go to these sites, like, I think it was, I went to Belladonna's site because she's on a phone or on Twitter.  And it took me to some page or some other. 
[02:08:00]  And I fucking, they shut you off the internet.  You call the company and say, look, I'm off the internet.  Like, yeah, you went to a site that you shouldn't go to.  Oh, fuck that.  They're business.  If you're paying for their fucking internet.  They fucking, certain sites that you can't go to.  Wow.  I couldn't get on.  And they were like, you have to call this company, the internet company.  And the guy was like, yeah, you went to an adult website.  He knew what I went to.  And he was like, look, I'm going to hook you up this time, but just make sure you don't go there. 
[02:08:30]  Can we put you on hold, Bob?  We have Gary Glitter and Pete Townsend that we're dealing with right now.  We'll get to you in a second.  And Jim Norton.  For the 15th time.  What the fuck?  Oh, Jimmy would lose his mind if they knock him off the internet while he's jerking off.  I didn't know they were doing that in hotels.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, it was weird.  Especially when you have your dick in your hand and you've been stroking it for 20 minutes trying to find the right one.  You get pre-cum on your thumb. 
[02:09:00]  It turned into cotton candy.  And then right when you found it, it just shuts off.  What is that about, trying to find the right scene?  And let's be honest with each other.  We always fuck it up and end up shooting at the worst possible moment.  Because we didn't time it right.  You go like, oh, I'm using that one.  I'm going to go back to that third scene.  Yeah, yeah.  And then all of a sudden, as you're rewinding, your jizz is flying everywhere.  You use one, and then you'll be like, no, I'm going to go back to that one.  That one was perfect.  And then you start going, and I go, nah, I can find something better. 
[02:09:30]  What is that?  Why?  That's why the YouTube and porn.  That sucks, because it's too much.  Back in the day, you had five porns that you watched.  I had five choices.  That's it.  Now, I go to that front page.  I haven't been there in a couple days.  And there's fucking in the ass, a black guy with three white chicks, a fucking tranny with fucking a chick and a dude.  You're like, fuck, which is it going to be?  Yeah, but like Anthony's saying, at that point, you're like, but I can find better than that.  And you think, like, all right, this is the one. 
[02:10:00]  I'm definitely going to finish off to this one.  And then you go and be like, no, no, no.  The other one was a little better.  Do you ever start fucking keyword searching?  You start just trying to be creative like pig.  I'm just going to type in pig.  Or knees.  I'm going to type in knees.  All right, fucking lettuce balls.  I just want to see what comes up with lettuce balls.  And then something comes up with a fucking mom and a daughter and a farm and they're being held hostage.  You're like, this is it.  Perfect. 
[02:10:30]  Can you type in lettuce balls?  Yeah, all right.  I thought you were going to say that.  Lettuce balls.  Lettuce balls.  Lettuce balls.  You can't find, you can't do rape, though.  They still, you can't get rape.  Yeah?  You type in rape, nothing comes up.  You have to type in forced.  Oh.  And there's only one that comes up.  And it's some French girl over a fucking ironing board.  Where are you going?  Oh, I don't know.  Danny will find anything.  So, that's exactly what I was trying to do, Danny.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  You can't.  We're doing lettuce balls.  Do you do lettuce balls?  Lettuce balls. 
[02:11:00]  I just put in lettuce balls.  But it's just coming up for balls.  It's just balls.  No lettuce.  Yeah, no lettuce.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  No lettuce, just balls.  Emptying my balls.  Nice.  Oh, we got Bob Kelly on the phone.  Hold on, guys.  We got Bob Kelly on the phone.  Wow, Bob Kelly's on the phone.  Hey, Bob, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  You know, you got your hotel room.  You know, you got your sheets.  You got your towels.  You got your turndown service.  You got your porno movie. 
[02:11:30]  Boom.  You jerk it off.  Don't forget your coffee.  Hey, what's the matter, dude?  I think you're going to have a lot of Bob Kelly's cars today.  Hey, Dad.  You know what the worst is?  I was in the car with my wife driving home.  And all of a sudden, he did the fucking trout rant as me.  Dad, I'm in the river.  And I look over at my wife.  She's fucking on the floor, cracking up at me.  When he starts going, trying to fill a void that's unfillable.  Boom.  I'm there.  I'm fishing this week.  It'll be something else. 
[02:12:00]  He fucking tears into you.  And it's hysterical.  It's got to be the funniest thing I've ever had.  He's a brick.  And he's so right on.  I'm trying to fill a void.  Fill that void.  I'm going to Beirut.  Oh, yeah.  No way.  I'm going to Beirut in Damascus.  Wow.  For what?  It's Bob Kelly the adventurer.  The treasure hunter.  Oh, you're treasure hunting again?  Not a gig or anything?  No.  What the fuck is in Beirut?  What is it called?  I forget what it's called.  Wikipedia fucking Damascus. 
[02:12:30]  And then it comes up.  Wait, what's in there?  Some ruins?  Yeah, like this fucking crazy archaeological site.  Is it where Moses walked or something?  No.  Jesus?  No.  Mohammed?  Who walked there?  Some fucking Abraham?  Abraham?  No, I don't know.  No, no.  That's in Iraq.  That's in Iraq.  Yeah, but it was all mishmash back then.  I think they were all just walking around back then.  And then they decided on their territory.  Yeah, scroll down to the bottom.  All the way to the bottom.  Damascus.  I'm going all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way.  Keep going, keep going, keep going.  It's just the length.  Keep going, keep going.  Keep going, trust me. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, we're going to fucking laugh when they saw your head.  Go up to Damascus.  Oh, dude.  Oh, we're going to have a riot with that one.  Oh, go up.  I'm sorry.  It says Damascus.  Click on that.  If that happens.  He's on Damascus.  Dude, help us out, Bob.  No, no, no.  Right?  You keep going.  Dude.  Take the mouse.  Type Syria.  Syria?  Syria?  You ain't going to Syria.  That's what Damascus is in Syria.  You're not even allowed to go to Syria.  Why are you?  You can go to Syria.  I don't know.  Who says?  Anybody.  No.  I'm fucking applying for my visa next week. 
[02:13:30]  Let me say how to chat in Tennessee.  As you rip into that sandwich.  Chad.  Hey, guys.  Be sure to tell Gio if I said happy birthday.  Yeah.  And a quick reminder.  That little fucking freak from Monsters and Midgets or whatever.  He's still on hold, probably.  Yeah, Gary's on hold.  We're going to get to him, man.  But, I mean, we're really behind.  No, he's right there.  We're behind a little bit.  Gary, he could hear us right now.  Gary, you understand.  We got Bob Kelly.  We're a little behind.  And we'll get to you in a few minutes.  So, please stay on hold. 
[02:14:00]  That's where I'm going.  Palmeira.  And what happens there?  It's just a fucking...  It's one of the only...  You're a nut.  What is it known for?  It's one of the old...  What did Jesus do there?  Jesus didn't do anything there, you fucking right-wing asshole.  What did my God do there?  No, what did he do there?  I don't know.  He probably fucking said some shit on a fucking stone.  You think he did a little...  Yeah, he did a little something-something.  You're going to like that?  Yeah, I'm going to that.  What the fuck is that?  That's like one of the oldest fucking archaeological sites ever. 
[02:14:30]  What if you go to like Rome, where they're not going to chop your head off and go see  fucking Rome?  You could see the same shit in Rome and you'd be safer.  Anthony's right.  What if you go to Rome and you're right and see the Parthenon?  Parthenon.  And I'm going to Beirut for a day.  And then I'm going to Dubai to go to the tallest building in the world.  Oh, you're going to do that?  Yeah.  Are you really going?  What the fuck?  Four days.  It's four days.  I was reading up on that.  It's a thousand bucks.  I was reading up on that damn thing yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I'm afraid of heights, too.  It's 200 and how many floors?  I think it's 160-something. 
[02:15:00]  169 floors?  It's 69.  I like when people say they're afraid of heights, but it's a fucking building.  Yeah, but it's still...  I can't walk to the window.  I get fucked up.  Like, I can't sit the Patriots game.  I got tickets last year.  I was up one level right up in front, and it's not cement or metal.  It's glass.  Yeah.  I had to keep my feet on the fucking glass because in my head it's going, jump, jump. 
[02:15:30]  Just jump.  Just do it.  Fucking do it.  I understand that.  Jump, jump.  That's the whole game.  I understand that.  Wow.  For real.  You are insane.  No, it's not insane.  You fucking asshole.  I like how normal you fucking are.  And everyone else is nuts.  Yeah, everybody else is nuts, but you're all fucking normal.  You ever go to the CN Tower in Toronto?  Nope.  Where they have the glass floor thing?  No.  And people walk across this thing, and it is, it's, I don't know what it does to your  mind.  You start freaking out.  You're like, this glass is going to give way. 
[02:16:00]  I'm going to fucking plummet.  Yeah.  But people have been doing it for decades.  Yeah.  Because the glass is really thick.  And you watch people timidly walk across this floor of glass, because you could see, obviously,  all the way down to the ground.  When we were in Vegas.  And you're well over a thousand feet up.  When we were in Vegas at the Palms, the new Playboy Tower, the top four suites.  Oh, with the jacuzzi?  The jacuzzi.  It's all, it's glass jacuzzi that shoots out of the side of the building.  Yeah.  So when you go to the edge.  Yeah.  It's fucking water and glass, and then you look, I can't, I couldn't even go to the 
[02:16:30]  fucking edge.  I had to sit like.  I've seen that on TV.  Yeah, fuck that.  You been in those?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was in those.  That's pretty fucking.  I was in those.  And there was, you know what's so funny about that is there's so many, I can't talk.  Forget it.  What?  What?  What happened?  I was fucking.  What happened?  I'm just, I'm just glad that I fucking.  What happened?  I'm just glad that I'm fucking.  Nothing.  Nothing happened.  What happened?  All I'm saying, I wish something, but nothing happens.  No.  Nothing.  Did you just tap out? 
[02:17:00]  Ha ha.  Woo.  No.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  I've been, I'm actually, I tried to get my girl pregnant for the first time in a  Aruba on vacation.  I left it in.  I actually came, I left it in for the first time in around fucking what?  16, 17, 17 years?  You've been with her for 17 years?  No, I haven't cummed inside a girl in like 17, yeah, cummed, cumzies, I didn't cumzies  inside of a girl.  I don't, I don't do that. 
[02:17:30]  That's like the fucking feeling, man.  I don't do it.  I don't fucking do it.  You have, you get one girl fucking pregnant and have to fucking kill that little thing,  and as soon as that happened, I had to fucking walk through that picket lawn with that  chick with no neck.  Yes.  That's my girlfriend who had a fucking chinch that just went straight to her tits.  It's fucking awful.  Well, get one of those abortions.  I did, I took her through the thing.  Bob Kelly got his girl one.  You think it worked or what?  What, the abortion?  No, the fucking, yeah, I think so. 
[02:18:00]  The baby making.  They sucked that out.  You're trying when you're white.  No, of course not.  It didn't work.  Matt from Orlando has a little comment.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, this is where Rich Voss is going to go.  Matty, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey, Bob Kelly's actually going through Dumb Ascus.  Dumb Ascus, get it?  Yeah, because, wait, he had Dumb and Ascus.  Yes.  I get it.  It's like a two-y.  Yeah, punch it out, boss.  Take it easy.  All right.  Dumb Ascus. 
[02:18:30]  Guys, we've got to get Mr. Gallagher in here.  Gallagher.  Gallagher rules.  He really does.  He's quickly becoming one of my favorite guests.  And he's been waiting easily an hour.  No, we're going to go to break.  And then we're going to get Gallagher in.  We'll talk to him.  Are we really bringing him in?  Yeah.  No, he's outside pacing.  Oh, okay.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get Gallagher in here.  He's going to be great.  I've never met him.  He's awesome.  From what I hear, he's got a few interesting stories to convey.  Yeah, he certainly does.  And then we've got plastic all over the place.  And he's going to smash the shit out of a bunch of things. 
[02:19:00]  I'm going in.  I'm going to go in the bubble with him and film some shit.  Should be fun, man.  But Opie and Anthony, Bob Kelly, what are you promoting?  At Gotham this week.  Gotham Comedy Club, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  And the phone number is?  Oh, I might have it, actually.  212-367-9000.  Yeah, and I'm actually going to get tickets.  If people call up to the show, I can give away five tickets right now.  Let's do it now.  Let's give away. 
[02:19:30]  Whoever calls up, five tickets.  If you get to New York this weekend and you want to see Bob Kelly call.  For a Thursday night show.  Travis, don't freak out.  It's not that big of a deal.  I'm wondering if you have five tickets or five pairs of tickets.  He just panicked.  Like I said, I'm going to give away a free car.  Wait, we can't do this.  We have five pairs?  No, five.  Five tickets?  Five tickets.  You want me to give out five single tickets?  For Thursday night show.  Five tickets?  No, give it to the first person that calls.  You give them the five tickets.  That's a weird number.  Okay, so one person, five tickets.  All right, give them four.  I don't give a shit.  Don't you want to give out pairs? 
[02:20:00]  No one wants to go to the comic club by themselves.  Yeah, that was my confusion.  Yeah, but if someone calls up, the first person to call up, you give them the tickets.  If he only wants two, give them two.  If another person calls up, give him three.  All right, so Travis is going to do some of that.  If some lonely asshole calls up, give him one.  All right, Travis will figure it out.  But you have five total tickets to give away you.  For Thursday night show.  You know what?  Five for Sunday, too.  I'm going to do five for Sunday.  It could be six.  How about you do six?  I'm going to do four for Friday.  I'm going to do five for Thursday, four for Friday. 
[02:20:30]  I'm going to do five for Sunday, and three and a half on Saturday night.  Got to sit on someone's lap.  Write that down.  Five, four, five, three, and a half.  Five, four, all right.  How many total tickets are you giving away?  There's five, and there's another five.  If that's ten, that's 17 and a half.  Just call if you want to see Bob Kelly at Gotham.  I'm giving away that many tickets.  Whoever calls right now, this weekend, Gotham Comedy Club.  Gallagher, next.  Stay there.  We'll be there.  We'll be there. 
[02:21:00]  We'll be there.  Ladies and gentlemen, in studio, 
[02:21:30]  Bob Kelly, it's been a while.  Our old friend is back.  And we also have Gallagher.  You haven't met Gallagher yet, have you, Bob?  No, I haven't.  But I know of him, of course.  Bob Kelly is a very good comedian.  Hi, buddy. How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Very good stand-up comedian, for real. 
[02:22:00]  Well, I hear he's going to be on Letterman.  I knew Dave when he was sitting across the street from the comedy store  with George Miller, and they'd watch Leave it to Beaver all day.  I said, Dave, you need to work on your acts.  He said, I don't need an act.  I'm going to have a talk show.  He knew he was going to have a talk show.  He didn't have to, you know, really be a touring comedian.  Sure.  Don't mention that to him.  Well, I wanted to talk to him about my new idea for a cow town here  in the Broadway area of New York, 
[02:22:30]  but now I've decided Rosie O'Donnell is the best person to talk to.  She loves theater, and she's got a show on this satellite.  Yes, on this very platform.  Here's what I'm thinking.  The Chinese, Japanese, Italians love Western.  They love rodeo and the cowboy whole thing.  We don't have that on Broadway.  It's no fun.  I want to walk down a board sidewalk making chinky sounds with my spurs,  with my chick in a big gown, go to Delmonico's, get a steak,  go to a saloon, have a drink with a tinkly piano, 
[02:23:00]  and then go and see a good Western band that's touring.  So I want to put dirt on one of the streets.  You know how they have block parties and they just block it off?  Yeah.  We need dirt on the street so that the stuntmen can fall off of the second story  and have gunfights in the street and ride a pony.  Why couldn't you ride a pony?  Isn't this fun?  I was on Broadway last night, and it's not any fun.  I saw Catherine Zeta-Jones in, like, this old-fashioned play,  and it hardly had a joke in it anywhere, 
[02:23:30]  and it was about sex all night and not even one joke.  Hey, you want to hear my Tiger Woods joke?  There's this beautiful girl in a wheelchair.  Does Tiger make a move?  No, he only fucks everything that walks.  See?  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of Tiger jokes, but I like mine.  Now, Gallagher, you were just showing off a picture of...  My girlfriend's daughter.  I have a new girlfriend for about six months. 
[02:24:00]  I've been living in Richmond, Indiana, because I met her at a show.  And, you know, I'm working my way down.  All right, all right.  Breathe, breathe, breathe.  I used to be famous, and now I'm on my way down.  Look at the places I'm working now.  I'm in some place in Danbury, Treehouse Comedy Club.  I work there.  It's good.  Yeah, but you're on your way up.  I'm on my way down.  No, I'm actually paused in the middle.  Brokerage Club.  I'm at the Brokerage Club in Belmore, New York.  I never even heard of this thing. 
[02:24:30]  It doesn't sound like a fun place.  It doesn't sound fun.  It's a good place.  You'll enjoy all these places.  If you were a fun place, would you call yourself Brokerage?  Brokerage.  Yeah, that is kind of bank-sounding.  And then I like the Stone Pony, but if you're going to have drugs, give them to people, not to the horse.  Oh.  Now, what is this with the daughter of the...  Let's see the picture.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before he gets there, though, there's a story about the woman he's dating.  Now, you just live in Richmond, Indiana now?  Where do you usually live?  Yeah, I want to get the daughter out of the house. 
[02:25:00]  I want her a career in L.A.  I got $3 million houses out there.  That's why I'm traveling around the country.  I got to make interest payments until the market comes back around.  Why don't you move her to L.A.?  It sounds like a better place to live than this Richmond, Indiana.  Or New York, you know.  Or New York.  It's modeling, you know.  I got to...  I heard about this girl you're dating.  There's more beautiful girls in L.A.  I need New York.  They're not beautiful here.  Someone take a sledgehammer and hit them over the head.  Gallagher.  Tell Anthony about the girl you're dating. 
[02:25:30]  I heard the story.  She's got some issues, possibly.  Uh, well, uh, she, uh, she leaves me every time we go to a bar.  Why?  Why?  I don't, well, I don't stand outside the bathroom when she comes out and I'm taking pictures with people.  And she's right.  You know, if you take a woman to a place, you ought to be at her side, you know.  But I'm Gallagher.  Well, you're Gallagher, so...  Oh, well, it won't work, you know.  I should be having sex with you.  She's got to make those concessions.  Yeah, well, you know, she says, yeah, yeah, you're Gallagher, all right.  But you're my man.  You're my man, you know. 
[02:26:00]  And I'm learning.  You know, I've been always marrying young girls, and now I've got a woman, you see.  She's 45, I'm 63.  Tell me how that works out.  But her daughter's 20.  You've got to see this daughter.  That's what I'm getting at.  Unbelievable.  Man, if you want to pawn her off.  I'm not pawning her, I'm pimping her.  Hey, you want to see Catherine Zeta-Jones?  No, let me see the daughter for fuck's sake.  I froze to death last night waiting outside the stage door.  You're too famous to be freezing to death to get a celebrity photo. 
[02:26:30]  I know, and I'm working my way down, like I told you.  But I'm going to remake New York.  I'm going to go to the mayor's office.  He needs to hear about this.  Wouldn't this be fun to have a western area?  We could call it the daughter.  The daughter.  It's dying.  Let's take a look.  Look at this chick.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Available?  Go to the list and you'll see the others.  Yeah, I need to get her away from the losers she's hanging out with in Richmond. 
[02:27:00]  Does her mother mind that you're lusting after her daughter?  I'm lusting.  I'm selling.  I'm pimping.  I'm getting her a job.  How much of this world is about sex?  I mean, really.  Anthony, how hot is she?  She's blonde, blue eyes.  How old is she?  20.  She just turned 20, had a birthday the day after Christmas, and she has really long eyelashes.  I want to get her a Maybelline commercial.  I took her to the Ford agency here on the day where they let amateur people come in, and  they were impressed with her because all the other chicks are, like, too skinny. 
[02:27:30]  You know, they're coked out and all.  Well, she's not.  Cracked out.  You make people go, oh, she's fat.  No, she's from the Midwest.  Midwest.  Oh, so she's got a big rump?  Big rump?  No, it's just the Midwest.  You know.  Uh-oh.  What's the problem with her?  America lives between L.A. and New York.  That's why I'm still performing.  Hook me up.  You know, if I was just in L.A. or New York, I wouldn't have a career anymore.  But how are the boobies on her? 
[02:28:00]  Good.  She's got the nice boobs.  Oh, my God.  Good enough.  You don't want to take away from your face.  Yeah.  Good of you to ask, though.  I'll never have sex again.  Hey, you know, I'm going to be rich the next time.  I won't even need to.  You said that last time.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened to all these get-rich schemes?  Well, I finally got to Bally's, and they're helping to develop my slot machine software.  I remember.  Tell Bobby about the slot machine.  You think the world likes new ideas? 
[02:28:30]  No.  We got new listeners.  We're blowing up.  All right.  Three watermelons are falling to the pay line.  They could either bounce off the pay line, crack in half, or bust in a bunch of little pieces.  You're a winner if the action matches.  So now think girls in bikinis are coming down in parachutes.  They could either do the splits, or their top could fall off, or one boob could get long and go back up again.  So it's more entertaining than the slot machine.  I mean, they're nuts if they think the kids that are playing video games today are going to go in and sit down at grandma's slot machines. 
[02:29:00]  This business is about to go bankrupt when this new generation, those old people are going to die.  They're not taking care of each other and themselves.  They're smoking.  They're on oxygen.  They're smoking with an oxygen bottle.  They're playing the slot machines.  They're going to die, and they're not ready for the new generation.  But I'm a visionary.  I see it.  And I've got the patent on it.  You can go to USPTO.gov and see my patent. 
[02:29:30]  I'll do that when I go home.  No one goes to a .gov site, Gallagher.  Well, that's where the patent is.  I've just proven I'm not bullshit.  Everybody in Hollywood's bullshit.  I was supposed to be in the Little Fockers movie two weeks before Christmas.  They said, now, can you come down?  Wait a minute.  We're not quite ready.  We're not quite ready.  They just called yesterday and said they're not even going to let me in the movie.  So I'd like everyone who's my fan to contact the Fockers movie and say it would have been a good idea to have Gallagher in there. 
[02:30:00]  I was supposed to perform at a birthday party.  But that's okay.  Anyway, Jack Black's documentary company is going to follow me around in my life.  And as I go to these different people, like I want to go see Rosie.  I want to go see the mayor.  They'll kind of document me trying to get the world to think outside the box.  Check this out.  You know who's going to be the mayor of Cowtown here in New York?  Yao Ming.  Because he, the Chinese love rodeo.  I work for Buddy Lee Productions. 
[02:30:30]  What?  I want Yao Ming.  Check it out.  He's got a hairline fracture in his foot.  What happened?  He can't live the rest.  I mean, he can't play basketball the rest of his life.  No.  He needs to have a touring rodeo.  Hey, the biggest show ever was the...  He just takes lefts.  No, I have a lot of ideas.  I have a lot of ideas.  He needs to have a touring rodeo show in China.  And because the Buddy Lee Productions said that the Chinese contacted them and wanted a rodeo show over there. 
[02:31:00]  And I said, well, you need a figurehead celebrity.  Let's use Yao Ming.  Because I've invented a Yao Boy hat.  Now, what this is, is Yao Ming on the front of the Cowboy hat was spinning a lariat.  And then you hang a little basketball from the front rim, brim.  And you do your head to try to get that basketball to go through the lariat.  Through the lariat.  It's a Yao Boy hat.  A lasso.  Hey, listen, the object of life is to sell something to every Chinese guy. 
[02:31:30]  And they'll all want a Yao Boy.  Look, I made millions off of Sledge rhyming with Veg.  Now I got Cow rhyming with Yao.  I've got to be a multimillionaire.  Besides my slot machine software.  The Chinese thing is very big because if you could even get a small percentage of those Chinese people to buy stuff, wow.  I'm talking about Yao Boy hat.  It just comes to me.  I'm making a horsey horsey.  You know how grandpa.  What's a horsey horsey?  You know how they like to put their kid, their grandchild on their knee and jump down.  Well, I'm putting a horse on your knee. 
[02:32:00]  I'm putting a horse there.  A little saddle with a neck and a head so the kid can hold on.  Oh, and you put it over your knee.  And you do it.  Yeah, you strap it to it.  You got a patent on that?  Yeah, and I've got, you know how girls like to put.  That's kind of a good idea.  The patent office.  Kind of a good idea.  Fucking, here's another Gallagher.  Here, let's open this up and see what he's got this time.  Hey, how about this one?  You know how girls like to put their glasses or sunglasses up on top of their head?  I've got them so they turn into a, what's it called when the diamond's in it? 
[02:32:30]  A tiara?  A tiara.  I'm 63.  I can't think of anything anymore.  I don't even remember how to remember.  How does it turn into a tiara?  Well, I've got a tiara on the side that swings around to the front.  Oh.  A half a tiara.  That's a dumb idea.  No, it is not.  Chicks like it.  I don't like that idea.  Wow.  Yeah, well, you're not in tune with your feminine side.  Girls do like tiaras.  Hey, can I sing my boob song?  I need music to this. 
[02:33:00]  Well, what do you think?  I'm a rooter for the hooters.  I'm a fan of the gland.  Just a knocker-gocker.  In other words, a man.  I try to look girls in the eye, but that ain't who I am.  I'm a cripple for the nipple and the part that don't get tanned.  How about that?  That is a song about breasts.  How can you mess with that?  Did you copyright that?  For my reincarnation coming back and uplift bra, I want to lug them jugs and be with women in the raw.  I want to hug them haystacks every little straw.  I want to tease them double Ds. 
[02:33:30]  I be the chief, me squeeze them squaw.  Whoa, damn.  Well, you know, I've already had hit records.  I started off in the novelty record area with Jim Stafford.  We had the first song about, and I'm 63, you know, in the 70s.  In the 70s, we had My Girl Bill.  This was the first song about homosexuals.  No way.  Yeah, look it up on the Internet if you want.  My Girl Bill.  He had spiders in stage.  Can we find My Girl Bill, please?  We had the first song about dope, with Wildwood Weed on one album. 
[02:34:00]  Called Rich Voss.  Hey, you're talking about a pioneer here.  You know, before me, nobody smashed anything on stage.  But there's Blue Man Group.  There's Quar.  There's Insane Clown Posse.  You know shit.  Quar.  Quar.  Yeah.  Quar or Quar?  Quar.  Q-U-A-R.  You're not hip to teen shit?  I hear about it because the stagehand says, what you started, Gallagher? 
[02:34:30]  Now we have to put plastic on the chair.  You want to attempt a question?  Or should I?  What?  I'm going to attempt a question.  Go ahead.  You have a lot of patents.  Yeah.  A lot of inventions.  A lot of ideas.  Yeah, I got a toilet that doesn't overflow when the kids put the toilet paper in it.  They're building it right now in China.  Have any of these ideas in China come to...  Yeah.  That toilet idea would be happening if they were building buildings.  Any of these ideas on the market?  On the marketplace?  In the marketplace?  Well, I was just at the gaming convention in Las Vegas. 
[02:35:00]  And for the fifth time, five years, I was pitching my idea of...  The watermelon thing.  Right.  The slot machine.  And finally, Valley said, yeah, we like this idea.  We want to develop this game with you, Gallagher.  They're also going to make a 3D slot machine of Gallagher that squirts the person when they win.  It'll be a little spray.  Can I ask a question?  Yeah.  Gallagher.  Yeah.  Why aren't you in Vegas at a hotel five, six nights a week? 
[02:35:30]  They don't want the mess.  But they do copy me.  They've got Blue Man Group there, and they hand out ponchos there.  I'm talking about all the comedians that later in their careers...  Yeah.  They go to Vegas, and they make...  To die?  Not to die.  Not to die.  Elephant burial ground.  But they make millions of dollars, and they...  No, they don't.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, no.  Well, I know everybody.  I know George.  He says he's the best 10 o'clock show.  I mean, he's the only 10 o'clock show. 
[02:36:00]  George Wallace?  Yeah.  He's the best 10 o'clock show.  And Carrot Top.  You know, he just gets by there at that pyramid.  It's not the greatest place.  There's too much happening.  Otherwise, the Cirque du Soleil shows wouldn't do good.  You have to be multinational.  You can't have language in your show.  And who in the hell wants to get splashed and then go into the casino?  It doesn't work in L.A.  It doesn't...  I mean, then Vegas.  So maybe you don't smash anything anymore.  I make plenty of these little clubs.  It's fine.  I'm doing all right.  Yeah, I like the tricycle with the car door on it. 
[02:36:30]  What's wrong with that?  That's not messy.  But I'd love to go see...  But that you can't...  Well, look here.  I'm doing an interview with you people and you want me to smash and it's radio.  It's radio and I'm smashing.  I was saying the same thing this morning.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Are we crazy?  Yeah.  Nobody...  See, it was the best and the worst thing that ever happened to me.  You know?  Yeah.  People don't realize what a skilled monologist that I am.  That's a big word.  I don't know what that means.  And I also...  You know, I'm a visionary. 
[02:37:00]  If I was president of the United States, I would never send in average people that signed  up for the military to fight in foreign wars.  As long as our prisons are full of gang members, these are people who want to kill somebody.  And you wouldn't even have to give them weapons.  You give them any crap and they make shit out of it.  Valid point.  I always have valid...  Valid point.  Everything I say is the truth.  You know why Ted Kennedy didn't mind having brain cancer?  Why?  Because he wanted to have a hole in his head like his brothers.  I step up... 
[02:37:30]  Jesus.  And I exhibit freedom of speech.  Yes.  I'll say those things.  And this is why we're in foreign lands.  You know.  Why are you not in Vegas?  I get...  Well, I'm a Midwest guy.  I travel between the two.  I'm not going to kiss that.  Where are you from?  I'm from Florida, which is a state with the unusual shape.  If the United States was a person, Florida would make it a man.  Yes.  Yes.  Penis.  Of course.  Wow, he's breathing.  And you live now in Indiana. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Well, when I can get by there, you know.  My next shows are going to be in Wisconsin and Minnesota.  It's not the best idea at this time.  I'm getting sure you're going up there in winter?  Well, who knew that?  Who knew at the time?  It could have been good weather.  You could pick these things better.  No, you can't.  Minnesota's like an August, late July thing.  Oh, I go there twice a year.  Yeah.  I love the...  I end up at all these Indian casinos.  What's your poison?  What do you mean?  What do I do?  Gambling-wise? 
[02:38:30]  No, I don't gamble.  I just observe human behavior and improve what's happening.  That's my lot in life.  As a comedian, I can't participate in life.  I would lose my objectivity.  So, you just observe.  I observe.  And help mankind evolve.  And I tell people what they're doing.  Right.  If you're a part of a political party or you're represented by a corporation, then you're not  going to be objective.  You're not going to tell them what they're doing wrong.  Too much self-interest. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  And it's the duty.  Politicians don't tell the truth.  Bill Clinton said oral sex is not considered sex.  Because, of course, he was engaging in it.  Yes.  And he didn't want to say that.  But there's old men in my audience every night.  If they have oral sex, I know they're going to count it.  And his wife, Hillary, she went to Montana one time because they told me.  And she said she's good with a gun.  Nobody there believed her because Bill's still alive.  So, being in politics is just lying.  Or being stupid.  I mean, can you imagine having an affair with a chick while you're running for president? 
[02:39:30]  Or even the governor of New Jersey trying to sneak down to, you know, Bill Clinton called  that guy, Elliot.  And he says, you're not paying for it, are you?  He says, don't you have an intern program?  That's good, right, Bobby?  Elliot.  I like that one.  Wow.  What are you talking about?  Well, I talked for three hours before I ever smashed food.  Hey, how's the day trading going? 
[02:40:00]  It's okay.  It's all right.  But like I said, I've got a lot of these ideas that are businesses of my own that I  need to work on.  Is your house just packed with shit over the years?  Are you a hoarder?  Are you a hoarder?  Yeah.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Well, you wouldn't throw it away, would you, if you'd used it in a video and it was a really  funny prop?  I've got a foam rubber steamroller at my house that I made for my next Showtime special,  and they never had one.  And so I've had the damn thing for 25 years.  What was the gag?  Well, I was going to squash kids. 
[02:40:30]  After you squash watermelons, then you squash kids.  Because these parents are not punishing their kids.  They're schmucks.  They're acting like they're friends.  That's why the kids won't pull their pants up and they're getting tattoos.  I saw a girl with a tattoo on her face yesterday on TV.  Really?  On one of these reality shows.  And only that boxer was supposed to be the guy stupid enough to put it on your face.  Mike Tyson, yeah.  Now they've invaded the face.  Well, you have a tattoo.  What do you think of girls having a tattoo on their face?  I mean, if it's like small enough and off to the side. 
[02:41:00]  I mean, maybe like one or two stars like Kat Von D has or something.  But what about if they get old?  I mean, a tattoo is like permanent.  You're making a decision for the rest of your life.  And you're going to have this little picture.  Why not just get a tablet if you feel artistic?  I mean, why use your body?  I don't get it.  You know a lot.  You know the new business now.  Bobby's got tattoos.  You want to see Bobby's tattoos?  Is removing tattoos.  That's a big business now.  You know why the tattoo ink stays in your skin?  Because there's a chemical on the outside that keeps the body from attacking it. 
[02:41:30]  And so to remove the tattoo, they neutralize that chemical.  And it bubbles to the surface.  That was a blue scab.  Isn't that intact?  Wow, yeah.  But you don't have a tattoo.  No, no.  No, no.  He does.  Bobby does.  You want to see Bobby's?  No.  He's got a koi fish.  It doesn't matter.  Bobby, show him your tattoo.  It's not very koi.  Just show Gallagher.  Do you want to show it?  Yeah, I want to see your reaction when you see Bobby's obnoxious, over-the-top tattoo. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, that's a little too much.  And it has cartoon colors.  Cartoon colors.  Well, I don't know, man.  What were you thinking?  I was thinking loneliness.  Do something to be accepted.  Well, why not get the picture on your belly with an arrow pointing toward your dick?  I don't want your tattoo that big.  You don't want girls to say, I really like your arm.  Prop tattoos are the worst.  When there's like a fucking arrow like that or some kind of thing.  Like a prop tattoo where it's like they use the belly button as something. 
[02:42:30]  Or I saw one that like a guy had a chick on his arm and it looked like her legs would spread.  And she had a big hairy bush because his armpit was hairy.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  No, it is cool.  You should get the tattoo of the guy with a lawnmower and put it on your head.  He pops it up right away.  This world is so high tech.  You know, I've got two website ideas.  One of them is Lil Gallagher runs around on your phone chasing celebrities. 
[02:43:00]  And when I catch him with my hammer and I smack him, the truth comes out.  And they quit lying.  My other one...  You think Tiger Woods is...  What do you think of Tiger Woods?  Well, what do you think?  I just told a joke about him.  I mean, he's pretty damn stupid.  He can't even be faithful to his girlfriend.  No one was listening.  I want you to get that tattoo.  The guy with the lawnmower.  And we'll put it on the top of your head.  I like it.  I like it.  You could rock that one.  Yeah, but a joke doesn't need to be on your body permanently.  Yeah, that could get old real quick. 
[02:43:30]  You know, we don't know the definition of stupid anymore because it's the style.  It used to be stupid for people to walk along the street talking out loud.  But with these Bluetooth earpieces now, you can't tell when they left the door open to the insane asylum because, you know...  It was only crazy people that walked around talking to themselves.  We don't know what crazy is.  We don't know stupid...  You know, if a kid with his pants half down is facing the wall, it looks like he's peeing on the wall.  I asked the cops the other day, I said, you know, what is the definition of indecent exposure?  And he says he has to see the brown round. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, shit.  So if it's a guy like you that's, like, really white, you can pee without getting arrested.  I mean, it's a confusing world we live in.  That's why the kids are screwed up is that we don't have the definition of anything.  You watch the football games.  We had to do a replay on every, you know, play to make sure his foot was down.  Did he have possession?  I mean, trying to stop the argument.  Big football fan?  Oh, yeah.  Who's your team?  I guess the Cowboys. 
[02:44:30]  Because I want Jerry Jones to be a sponsor of my Cowtown here in New York.  He's not going to listen to you.  What?  And the mayor...  Have you been to the new stadium?  He's...  Yeah.  I got a...  Oh, I lost that.  I had a picture of it.  I stayed in a motel across from it.  There's a funky little motel for 50 bucks across the street.  It's really stupid.  But I was at a casino two nights ago across from...  Hey, have you ever been to Tulsa?  There's these praying hands there at Oral Roberts University. 
[02:45:00]  Across the street is an Indian casino.  I can't believe it.  You've been in the business.  Oh, you're going to prove it to him?  Show him.  You've been in the business almost 50 years.  You shouldn't be staying in $50 a night fucking hotel rooms.  It's funny.  Treat yourself.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  Who cares?  I sleep in my car a lot.  Who needs to...  I go to the next...  See, there's the praying hands at Oral.  I was trying to talk them into my family reunion resorts, which I probably talked about the  last time I was here.  These are places where families to get together. 
[02:45:30]  I want to strengthen America's families by giving them a place to get together.  It's a big open room surrounded by bedrooms.  I want to call it 40 doors.  And you cook in the middle and you smell the food of your ethnicity, you know, and you  bond.  It's about bonding.  We were talking about bed and breakfast.  No, this ain't a bed and breakfast.  This is a...  It's a bed and breakfast.  I like the idea, but it's been invented right now.  There's no...  No.  It's no fun to go down the hallway.  It's 40 rooms.  40 rooms. 
[02:46:00]  Plus, you know, a building is the set for the scenes of our lives.  This is dramatic.  When you leave the group and go in your room, everybody can see.  And when you come out again, then everybody can see.  I understand.  And there's a girl's bathroom.  You're into watching.  Well, you know, there's no place for bridesmaids to get together.  Did you see my big fat Greek wedding?  Yes.  What a wonderful time they had the night before the wedding.  There's no place to do that at a hotel.  You can't have makeup, mirrors, and places to hang gowns.  Everybody gets married and there's no place for the preparation of a marriage. 
[02:46:30]  It's a production.  Like a video or a movie, it needs to have a place.  You are full of ideas.  I should rule the world.  Just let me set things up.  I wouldn't put telephone poles next to the road.  What a stupid idea to put an immovable object next to where you're driving.  I've been saying that for years.  And then if you don't hit the pole and kill yourself, there's a sidewalk.  You can kill people.  And in most cases, you can at least move the telephone pole like 10, 20 feet off the road.  But no, it has to be right next to the road. 
[02:47:00]  Please!  And then why would you drive from the front seat?  Drive from the back seat.  Put the kids in the front seat.  Parents would drive safer.  Why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways?  Why is net zero 995?  That's what I want to know.  Yeah, well, that's to get its identity and then it turns into a liar.  Just like you think you're going to get sex for free when you get married.  And it costs you more than hookers.  I guess Tiger Woods is learning that now. 
[02:47:30]  He should have just bought hookers.  He's going to lose 300 million, Gallagher.  She hit him in the face and broke his eye orb and his cheek.  That's why he's not, because I know golfers.  And they told me, well, you know, he was playing poker upstairs at his house until late.  And, you know, he takes Ambien to go to sleep.  So he falls asleep, leaves the phone on the poker table.  She finds it and she gets so mad because of all the text messages. 
[02:48:00]  She gets a three iron and goes.  And isn't that ironic?  And even ironic is ironic because iron is in the word ironic.  Can you believe it?  He might be telling the truth.  We have an exclusive.  We have an exclusive that no one's going to pay attention to.  This is why he can't show his face.  But it's embarrassing also that your wife, you're the biggest golfer and you get hit in the face with a golf club.  Don't have clubs around the house.  What if he was a baseball player?  He'd be dead.  Who told you this?  A golfer that I met at the convention. 
[02:48:30]  A professional golfer?  Yeah.  I got to think about who he was.  What's that?  See, I've been telling the truth all day and now he wants me to verify this.  No, you know something?  I believe him.  I think the story is pretty cool.  Hey, do you like any of his girlfriends?  Who's your favorite tiger girlfriend?  Which one would you be with?  We love the Perkins waitress.  Well, she looks really good in one picture and really ugly in another picture.  That's what I can't figure out.  You can't get enough of the Perkins waitress. 
[02:49:00]  Well, I can't figure out.  That's the bad picture.  She had sex in the back seat and she says he only wants me for sex.  But she agreed to it in the back seat.  This is what started it is they have video of him screwing her in the back seat in a parking lot.  Right.  Because he had to have it so bad and she wasn't at it.  Wait, how do you know that?  Well, that's common knowledge that they have that.  They have that video.  No one else is reporting it.  I know there's a sex tape that's being shot that could be a tiger. 
[02:49:30]  They're not really sure yet or whatever.  But why would she agree to it?  Our favorite, though, was that blonde.  I like the blonde.  One of the last ones that came out.  That was her name.  Shit.  Jamie.  Nah, I hated Jamie.  Jamie sucks.  No, no, I didn't like her.  Holly something?  Ah, I can't remember.  Come on, stupid people.  Holly Samson?  But why?  Here's the deal, though.  Bobby, you gave up.  Why?  No, dude, I just was...  That shit that happened to Tiger freaks me out, Alex.  But Tiger didn't really go at this like a businessman and choose a person, you know, by having somebody help him. 
[02:50:00]  It's just who he bumps into, like waitresses and the hostess at the bar.  Yeah.  He's like us.  I mean, that's how we score with chicks.  He's got all this money.  He should be like Michael Jackson.  Go to the Orient and get these people for nothing.  You banged some of these waitresses at the comedy clubs over the years?  Oh, yeah.  My first girlfriend in L.A. was a waitress.  Her name was Robin Riker.  She ended up on Showtime on the Brothers show. 
[02:50:30]  It was the first show about homosexuals on TV.  And then she was the star...  You can look her up.  Robin Riker.  She was the star of Alligator, where these alligators are loose in the sewers of New York.  I remember that.  There's a good movie.  Remember that movie?  I paid for the cast party for that damn movie because they were so cheap.  The wrap party.  Yeah.  And that they...  Hey, she's all right.  Yeah, I got her.  You're doing all right, man.  Well, that was my first girlfriend.  It got better from there?  Well, it got different. 
[02:51:00]  Is it getting...  I got different.  Well, you don't want to be with an actress if your career is on the way up.  Because, you know, I wanted somebody that wasn't in show business.  So my daughter's mother wasn't in show business.  But now the daughter wants to get into some kind of show business.  No, that's my girlfriend, my new girlfriend's daughter.  My daughter is the catering director of the Four Seasons in Westlake Village, California.  Where Dole has his... 
[02:51:30]  No, not Dole.  It's the other guy.  Mac...  McCain.  No, it's like...  McDonald's?  No, he owns the island of Lanai.  I went there.  You know, he moved all the pineapple growing from Lanai to the Philippines.  And they put a hotel there.  I couldn't even...  I can't remember how to remember.  It has to do with a...  You're right.  Oprah dropped by, though.  There's a TV studio there.  And she might make her show there.  Oprah lives down... 
[02:52:00]  She lives in Santa Barbara.  Are you getting a good tell nowadays?  What?  I know you're with somebody, but how's...  What do you mean I'm with somebody?  How's the last six months?  Well, six months.  Six months ain't shit.  You know the reason I come on your show and not Howard Stern is that...  Oh, we don't go down that road?  Howard always asks me, you know, how much money I have left and do I get any...  Get any ass?  Right.  And you've got...  You want to talk about your ideas?  Well, the world is bigger than just that. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, what is that?  Who cares?  Does anybody really care about that?  I think you're going to get so many phone calls, emails, and text messages on my ideas.  I'm just glad you know the difference between the two shows.  So I thank you for that.  But the thing is, like, we never ask.  So if we ask once, that's all right.  Yeah, we could ask a little bit.  That's all.  Just once.  As long as my hammer is stiff.  There you go.  All right.  Is that a Gallagher jacket?  Yeah.  Can you see that?  It's from the 80s.  Oh, no shit.  Is that one of a kind or the people... 
[02:53:00]  Oh, no.  This was for my whole group.  You know, I used to have a tour group, you know, truck drivers, sound men, you know, T-shirt guys.  Did you settle it with your brother?  We have an update on that?  No.  I'm not interested in him anymore.  I have so many fans.  Why deal with my family?  That was the craziest story ever, though.  Well, that was weird, too, because when I first started comedy in Boston, I remember Gallagher  was coming, but then it wasn't him. 
[02:53:30]  It was your brother.  Well, I needed to stop Carrot Top from doing a splashing act in small clubs, because he  was copying me, you know, the striped shirt, the mic around the neck, the box full of props.  And he had my manager, he had my sound man, and he had my bus driver, Carrot Top.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was my old manager was trying to put me out of business.  So I told my brother to go into the comedy clubs and do...  Well, at that time, I had about eight hours of material.  I had eight one-hour shows on Showtime. 
[02:54:00]  So I told my brother to do jokes from the first four, which I weren't doing any.  That's a great idea.  On paper, it's a great idea, because...  Plus, he didn't have a job!  Hold on.  And you're in, you know, big, like, theaters at this point, or whatever, and bigger than  that...  I can't go to these little places, so I sent my brother...  On paper, it sounded like a great idea.  So I used the guy out of Louisville, who owns the comedy caravan there, Tom Sobel.  He knows every comedian's act and where they are.  All the club owners call him and say, somebody dropped out, who would fit in with this flow 
[02:54:30]  of this show?  And he'll tell them and send the guy, or the girl.  And he managed him and booked him for four or five years, but my brother was such an asshole  that the girls in his office says, do we have to deal with Ron?  And he says, nah, we're done with him.  And so then my brother ran across a bunch of unscrupulous promoters who decided to say,  you know, if we charge $22 instead of $12, they'll be confused as to whether it's Gallagher  or not.  You know, we're giving it away, charging $12. 
[02:55:00]  And they make twice as much money.  So that's what they started doing, and it confused the audience around the country, because,  you know, people didn't want to see my brother if it was my show.  And so I told him, yeah, I said, you have to stop.  And he wouldn't stop, so I had to take him to patent court.  I took him to copyright court.  And that's, so don't tell me about patents and copyright not being important.  That's how I stopped him.  Wow.  I not only stopped him from doing my act, I stopped him from having a mustache and wearing  a hat.  Are you serious? 
[02:55:30]  Are you serious?  I almost stopped him from fucking my old girlfriend.  Holy shit.  Because it's part, I patented my logo.  I got the copyright on it.  But because of that, you don't talk to any of your family anymore, right?  Oh, yeah.  I talked to my brother.  I have another brother who taught almost all of the Navy jet pilots for the last two decades.  My brother, Jerry Gallagher, is a teacher at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland 
[02:56:00]  and at the test pilot school there.  And he teaches jet pilots how to fly them planes.  Does your brother, your other brother, does he look like you?  I mean, were people disappointed when they showed up?  Well, when he grew the mustache and wore the hat, yeah, it kind of looked like that.  People are stupid.  They don't know.  People are stupid.  What he would do is he would turn the music up so they couldn't talk before the show.  Oh, shit.  He had all the tricks.  Yeah.  Well, here's the best trick was he would have them sign their credit card voucher in the 
[02:56:30]  lobby before the show.  So then they all thought, well, I can't get my money back.  What a nightmare.  What's worse than that is he had his wife in the lobby doing that.  And they had three kids at the time.  So he was actually leaving his kids with a multinational nanny while he took her on the  road to make sure he cheated good.  Wow.  That's a crazy life to live.  But does he even sound, because you have a distinctive voice.  I mean, you know, your voice is, you know, you silhouette your voice. 
[02:57:00]  So does he sound like you?  I mean, or does he sound completely different?  I think he sounds different.  Every night I meet somebody that looks more like me than my brother.  Yeah.  Just because we have the same parents, it doesn't.  But you use the word silhouette.  You know, that's French.  How did it feel in your mouth?  Doesn't it feel baggy?  I am so sick of French words.  I hate.  It's a fiance.  Do you ever say this is my fiance? 
[02:57:30]  What a stupid.  You know, French people have a big nose.  That's why they like to honk it.  And that's what they go, fiance, like that, like restaurant.  You know, you don't mind feeling faggy, though, right?  I just, I hate French words.  If we're English, you know, we're descended from the Vikings.  I know you are, because you have red hair.  Yeah.  And you have no color.  Yeah.  You're from those islands up there.  Oh, wow.  And you, you're descended from people who rape and pillage and plunder.  That's why you're interested in these things.  Nice.  Why, yeah, why, why would we still use like a liaison? 
[02:58:00]  Instead of sex, because we want to lie.  Yeah.  French people invented lying and half-truths.  Right.  Instead of saying, I have perverted friends, you have a menage a trois.  Yeah, yes, yes.  You know, and instead of saying, I'm screwing this chick, you say, I want you to meet my  protégé.  Sabotage.  All the military terms are French because of that little short Napoleon, who was actually  a Mexican.  He was a Mexican who went over there.  Was he?  And yeah, he invented, you know, sabotage, espionage, battalion, and, um, and all the 
[02:58:30]  words having to do with the military.  They still use them on the news.  They talk about a sortie.  They fly on a sortie.  Doesn't that sound gay?  I was on a sortie and I found a weapons cache.  And then this is why the kids make low grades in spelling is the French words that have G's  in them for no damn reason, like design.  What in the hell is a G doing?  Or sign.  I mean, what the hell is it hanging out there?  Or foreign or sovereign?  Hey, Gallagher, how do you shut down your brain so you can sleep at night? 
[02:59:00]  I'm up with Tiger.  He's texting me.  How many hours sleep do you get at night?  I think four is enough.  Tops, right?  Well, when you get old, you don't sleep.  Really?  Yeah.  What happens?  I don't know.  You're going to find out.  Well, you worry about your prostate.  I have to go to the doctor when I'm not sick just to have him look for something that God  hid up my ass.  I don't know why he just didn't put it on my elbow.  That would have been really nice.  You know, I could believe God loves me. 
[02:59:30]  There's a lot on that one.  That's a good idea.  You should patent that.  You should patent that.  I'm pissed about the cracks between my teeth.  If he knew I was going to use them to eat with, why put cracks?  You know, Barney the dinosaur has one smooth tooth.  Why can't we have one smooth tooth?  It doesn't make a bit of sense.  And God makes you fall in love and want to kiss and puts a bumper, your nose, right in  the way.  A wet, drainy thing upside down over your mouth.  He doesn't like you.  You should switch your nose with your belly button.  Then these kids could keep their pants up and diseases would be in their pants. 
[03:00:00]  And they would, you know, when they sneeze, their zipper would whistle.  I haven't got it all figured out.  But it makes perfect sense.  It does make sense.  If I was designing the human body, I'd have one foot to the front and one to the back.  Because if you were a Christmas tree, you'd fall over.  Don't put both of the feet bending out the front.  You can't even dance with a girl.  You're going to step on her toes.  You should bend her feet out the back so when you push chicks, they don't fall over  so easy.  And as long as they have support to the rear, put their tits on their back, and then men 
[03:00:30]  would slow dance a lot more.  See, I've thought the whole thing out.  I have.  Bobby?  He does observe.  It's good.  I'm into boobs.  I like the whole nose thing.  I can rewind it a few times.  But what about two eyes on one side of your head and nothing out the back?  You have a rearview mirror on your car and your truck, and you've got nothing.  Close one eye, and you can move your head.  You can see everything you need to see.  Put an eye out.  If God loved you, there'd be one.  Look at your ears.  They are stupid. 
[03:01:00]  They look like tumors.  They're all wrinkled up.  They're supposed to funnel the sound down that hole.  If your dish at home looked like that, you wouldn't get one channel.  Girls like their ears because they put their hair behind it, but when you put your head  down, then the hair falls out.  If God really loved girls, he'd give them longer ears with a barrette clip.  But he's not thinking about it.  He puts your butt so far back, you can hardly reach it, and then you've got to wipe it.  You tell me why the God who invented the universe couldn't make an ass that slammed shut.  I'm just saying, think about this. 
[03:01:30]  You know, why not poop out the bottom of your foot?  Then when you're done, you just scrape it along the ground.  When you're constipated, you just stomp it.  You stomp it, and when one's clogged up, you shit out the other one.  What's the problem?  It makes perfect sense, Bobby.  You could just run some intestine down your legs.  Well, God wants you to think, and that's what I'm doing here.  He gave you a brain.  Actually, he gave you two brains.  He gave you a left brain wired to your right hand.  A right brain wired.  He cross-wired you.  And these wires rub up against each other. 
[03:02:00]  You get old, then they short out, and you have Alzheimer's.  You can't remember where you live.  And your wife knows this, and she says, why don't you go out and get some exercise?  He gives this so much thought.  You've got to stop smashing stuff.  I'm the smartest guy who was ever stupid enough to want to be a comedian.  Wow, Gallagher.  Can we take a break, and then you smash some stuff, and we'll do more of your ideas?  What are we going to sell?  You don't even know, huh?  You just take a break, and they put it in a local commercial?  Oh, yeah.  I could care less. 
[03:02:30]  No, you couldn't care less.  If you could care less, then it could be more.  I know.  People don't do this right.  I couldn't care less.  You're right.  I know it.  I hate it.  In English, I could care more.  This is why Mexicans can't speak English.  We don't say what we're saying.  We say, instead of saying I'm busy, we say I have too much on my plate.  You don't want to tell somebody bringing you your food you have too much on your plate.  Or we say we're going to pay you under the table.  That's why they're sitting under there on Friday.  They're waiting for their check.  Hey, Callie, you really have to leave at 10? 
[03:03:00]  I don't have to go anywhere until Friday.  But I'm going to go to a play at 2 o'clock.  It's Wednesday.  We got matinees.  I want to see a play on Broadway.  I've been thinking about that one about Carnage.  God of Carnage.  I was told he has to leave at 10 o'clock.  Oh, it's some interview, but I don't give a fuck.  I'm working in such little places.  You got a plug there. 
[03:03:30]  I don't care.  No, I'll get the plug there.  I don't care.  It's probably for a show in Eau Claire.  But that's French.  And I don't like the French.  They were selling furniture to Saddam Hussein.  This is the place to be, right, Gallagher?  This is it.  January 8th, you're going to be in Danbury, Connecticut at the Treehouse Comedy Club.  I was down in Asbury Park when the boss was rehearsing for his show the last time.  January 9th, he's going to be in Asbury Park, New Jersey, the Stone Pony.  And January 10th, you're going to be at Belmore.  It's all on my website. 
[03:04:00]  Even the Chinese know what I'm doing.  Hey, I'm Google-able.  If you put Gallagher in there.  You can go to livenation.com or treehousecomedy.com for tickets.  January 8th, 9th, and 10th.  Go to the website.  You've got to go see Gallagher.  Unless you go see me.  You have Gallagher.com.  Everybody wants to take a picture, and they can't operate their cameras.  And they make them simple.  They're really simple.  Does that frustrate you?  Because I'm grinning the whole time.  And you're waiting.  You look silly.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  For real. 
[03:04:30]  If you have to do that interview.  No, I don't need to go anywhere.  We're going to take a break.  I'd like to solve the world's problems.  Somebody needs to tell me a problem and rip my brain, and I'll give you the answer.  Do you have Gallagher.com?  No, I don't need it.  If you just put Gallagher in Google, you come up with my website near the top.  Is that me right there?  Currently number one on there.  Comedy legend Gallagher.  Yeah.  And then there's my...  It goes currently number one.  Currently number one if you type in Gallagher.  Yes. 
[03:05:00]  Right.  Four days.  But I don't like this ad for the fat chick that I'm getting from Google.  Look at that ad.  What is that?  I don't know.  I hate it.  Then there's this fat chick on my website the whole time.  I'm trying to make a couple of bucks with Google.  You're not working out.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All my money goes to my office.  They write the bills.  I think I'm still rich.  I don't give a shit.  I don't know what's happening with money.  You've got to love Gallagher.  When we get back, we're going to smash stuff. 
[03:05:30]  Well, you know, I let people smash at my show.  I don't do the smashing.  I let the...  You let people smash stuff?  Yeah.  And then they take digital pictures and they put it on the websites.  Can you go to my pics here and you'll see people...  Well, I know.  I was at your show last time you were at the Stress Factory.  Did you smash...  Stress Factory?  That's the stupidest name for a comedy club.  I agree.  I tried to tell the guy.  And there's a ladder out in front.  What's that got to do with it?  And then the guy, he plays Babies Throwing Up on video right before you come out. 
[03:06:00]  I said, I can't follow puking.  The people like it.  The people like the...  I don't want to...  I don't want to follow it.  You know about energy.  He's just drained them, showing them the best videos for half an hour.  And it's a phone call.  Did he do a phone call where he calls up, he does a little improv with the crowd?  That's always a...  No, you shouldn't be a comedian if you own a club.  He's not.  He told the longest routine I have ever heard about his kid getting arrested. 
[03:06:30]  He called...  Oh, he's been telling that story for five years.  On and on and on and on and on.  God almighty.  He's in the car.  That's the stress.  That's the stress of working at that place.  Yeah, the comedians are stressed out.  That's why.  Mitzi Shore never knew anything about comedy.  She ran a club just fine.  Of course, her kids aren't funny.  No.  You know, when I go to radio stations, Pauly is the worst interview. 
[03:07:00]  Everybody says the worst interview they ever had was with Pauly Shore.  I used to take him to Cub Scouts.  I should have told him, now, Pauly, be prepared.  Have some jokes and answer the questions.  He's a jerk now because he's older.  He's too old.  He's in his mid-twenties and he was, you know, about being young.  But now he's, you know, he's gawky and awkward because he's older than he should be.  I haven't seen him recently in any media.  He reminds me of Carrot Top.  It's just kind of stupid. 
[03:07:30]  You don't want to be a punchline.  The object of comedy is to be a legend like myself.  Not a punchline.  You are a legend, Gellis.  I think there would never have been a mosh pit if I hadn't smashed stuff off of the stage.  Because it's just the next thing.  Food comes off the stage.  Kids come off the stage.  You know, it's showing disrespect.  So you invented grudge.  I invented not caring about the fourth wall in theater.  And reaching out and participating. 
[03:08:00]  Using a theater as a fun place instead of looking like grandma's house.  With vases on tables and Rococo, you know, designs and boring shit.  Yeah, gold.  They're all gold.  What do you think?  This is my life.  I come into them and they've redone them.  I said, did you redo it in fun shit?  No, we redid the old stuff.  You're not afraid somebody might smash their own finger and sue you or something?  Yeah, you don't want a lawsuit.  Your finger is not there. 
[03:08:30]  Your hand.  Look, it's some woman.  She can't swing the fucking camera.  No, what I'm afraid of is they fucking hit me with it.  Because I'm standing near it.  Yeah, that's true.  Or they let go of it and it flies out in the audience again.  You look like a mad scientist in that picture.  Do you ever hear that happen?  I am a mad scientist.  I study subatomic particle physics all day long.  Yeah.  I'm turning the subatomic particles into action figures.  I'm working with a Japanese cartoon company right now.  It's always Japan or China with them.  People don't know the difference between an electron and a photon. 
[03:09:00]  Let me ask you, what carries the signal to your cell phone?  An electron or a photon?  Electron.  Electron.  Electron.  You're totally wrong.  It's a photon.  You schmucked.  I said photon.  50-50.  I said photon.  Yes, it is a photon.  Part of the 11th say that.  Because we had the wrong answer, Gallagher.  He just tricked you.  So?  So?  People don't know the difference.  Look, an electron has mass.  If you're putting your boob down to have a scan to see if there's cancer in there, 
[03:09:30]  you don't want to let something with mass go through your DNA.  It could break it.  People need to know the difference between a particle that has mass.  You know, F equals MA.  If it has mass, then it can break your DNA.  You know, people get cancer from x-rays.  Of course.  3%.  Go on Wikipedia.  Do cancer from stomach x-rays, and you'll find 3%. 
[03:10:00]  It's 5% stomach, 3% brain.  Wow.  What if you take your kid to have a brain x-ray, you know, 3 out of 100, get cancer from daddy  checking.  People need to know this.  They're not aware.  What about putting your phone up to your ear?  Do you think you increase that risk?  See, now you're showing your age.  What?  You're showing your age.  Why?  Because we don't use our cell phones to make calls.  But now you're saying that that's full time.  We're texting or we're typing the whole time.  Typing.  We're going to get indexed.  Well, that's another thing I'm going to fix. 
[03:10:30]  There's no reason for PQRS to be one.  One letter.  I mean, one number.  It's just ridiculous.  Because we need to redo the keyboard according to usage.  I've got to call you out on something here.  The cell phone wouldn't give you a brain tumor or anything because it's photons and not  electrons, which have mass.  But at high frequency, gamma rays are also photons.  And when they come off of the sun, we have to turn our communication satellites away from 
[03:11:00]  the sun.  And that's why they're hardened.  They have a lead side to them.  And we've actually just put a satellite on the other side of the sun so that they could  see now the solar prominences before they get to the rim as it comes around and turn  the satellites earlier.  But gamma rays are also a problem in cancer research.  Because you see, I have two stents in my heart.  They actually put a gamma ray emitter on my heart, four pieces of radioactive material. 
[03:11:30]  And I'm lying on the guy's table.  And this is the guy who invented the stent, Dr. Schatz, at the Green Hospital in La Jolla.  And he says, we're going to use a gamma ray emitter because we found they're nicer to  people than than beta rays.  And I said, well, what is the difference between a gamma ray and a beta ray?  And he says, well, I don't know.  But my radiologist does.  And when he left the room, all the kids came from the different laboratories all around  and said, you're the first guy who ever stopped Dr. Schatz.  That's great.  But it's the same.  You don't want to be the first. 
[03:12:00]  Well, nobody ever asks anything or is curious.  And then they die.  This is the problem with America.  We never are preemptive.  We never do anything from experience.  We always do it because it already happened and we're going to stop it.  Like now they're going to be more security at the airport.  Yeah.  Right now.  Now let's do this.  After the fact.  After the.  Yeah.  Let's not kill some more people.  And so, you know, we never.  Why do we elect old people if they don't use their experience?  Because old people know this is their last job and they're going to have to set themselves 
[03:12:30]  up in some way and cheat, you know, and go into lobbying.  Whereas if we elected young people, they're idealistic and they don't say I.  So I'd even read.  You couldn't get the Ten Commandments through Congress if Moses was buying drinks.  All right, Gallagher.  Brief.  We're going to smash stuff after the break.  Hey, do you want any dead air?  That's what you get with Pauly.  We had him on once.  Yeah.  Dead air.  You know, you ask him a question, say yes or no.  And then where the hell does it go?  Yeah, it was horrible.  We didn't like it.  It really was terrible. 
[03:13:00]  And you don't like the choice factor.  We'll be right back after this word here on the Opie, Anthony and Gallagher show.  You know, my middle name is Anthony.  We almost went to break.  We almost went to break.  We almost got there.  Take us a break, Gallagher.  It's the Opie, Anthony and Gallagher show.  All right, Opie and Anthony, Bob Kelly, who's going to be at Gotham Comedy Club here in New  York City.  That's Bob Kelly, Gotham Comedy Club. 
[03:13:30]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Sunday too, Bobby.  Sunday too, yes.  Thursday, I can make Thursday.  You know you're not famous when you have to do Sunday and Thursday.  Gallagher, would you go see Bob Kelly at Gotham?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you have your shirt on backwards?  I don't think.  Maybe.  His sweater's on backwards, yeah.  I don't get enough.  I like it.  That's funny.  You should have met.  You screwed up your flow about me going to see you.  Yeah, man.  What's up?  Then you criticized me.  You asked me, now will I go in service?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He's nervous.  He's in studio with the legend.  You know.  It's true.  Let me help you with a routine. 
[03:14:00]  Do you have something you've been working on and you just can't get it?  Maybe I could help you with that joke or observation.  That's a good question.  What have you got that's new?  Don't you have four or five new things you want to try out?  My grandfather's turning 100 and he's going to die.  Yeah.  And I want to know what he's going to leave me.  What's the premise?  Well, does he own anything?  I think he owns a buck knife.  What makes you think this area is funny?  It's a good question.  I wouldn't say Andy's going to die anyway. 
[03:14:30]  When you say my grandfather's 100, everybody thinks that.  They go, the fucker's going to die.  Right.  Now, is the dead imminent?  I want to know what he's going to leave me.  Does he have something?  Well, eventually.  He's 100.  Well, so pick something like...  Old man goes in a drugstore, starts knocking stuff off the shelves with his cane.  The man comes over and says, can I help you, sir?  He says, no, I'm just looking.  Isn't that funny?  See?  See, that's an old man joke.  I don't know.  What's funny?  You've got to get to it.  You know, when I work in a club, people are drunk.  They have no attention span. 
[03:15:00]  You've got to...  How do you make picklebread dildo?  You've got to get to it.  Yes.  You can't fart around.  How about something very old, like from, like, 1900?  Hey, I like this new joke.  Have you heard this one?  That would be funny.  A wooden horse?  Yeah, what's he going to leave you?  And instead of, you know, a fortune or something like that, it's something from 19 to 10.  Like a pocket watch?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  No, none of this area is funny.  It's not.  No, no.  The pocket watch isn't funny.  No.  What makes you think this area is funny? 
[03:15:30]  Something useless from 1910.  Okay.  No.  All right.  Part, tit, dick.  These are your three areas.  Part, tit, dick.  That's it.  These are the three areas.  Besides stupid, you know, like a guy who picks something out of his teeth, looks at it, and  puts it back in his mouth.  This is stupid.  This gets a laugh.  Everybody does it.  They identify.  I like this new joke I heard where this couple's out running, and she has to pee, and he backs  her up to a cliff, and there's a lake underneath the cliff, and he says, why aren't you peeing? 
[03:16:00]  She says, I'm looking down at that little canoe.  And he says, no, that's a reflection.  That is such a good joke, because it's not your dick or your butt.  It's so hard to have a good vagina joke.  That's a vagina joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Vagina joke.  It is.  I love a good vagina joke.  They do look like canoes.  I love a good vagina.  Yeah.  Forget the joke.  And Anthony had a great observation.  You got a Freddy Krueger look.  Yeah.  The hat.  The hat and the sweater. 
[03:16:30]  But I'm going Western.  You know, I bought this in Indiana, but I'm, you know, pumping my Western idea of making a cow town here.  Do you think I should go and see David Letterman with this idea?  Because he's powerful.  He could get this happening.  He's too busy getting pushed.  He is so busy.  No.  Look.  Ellen DeGeneres picks better looking chicks than Dave.  That's the joke.  Than Dave.  Come on, darling.  But Ellen's problem is her tits are bigger than her girlfriend's.  I mean, how does that work?  I mean, that your tits are bigger than your girlfriend's. 
[03:17:00]  I mean, can you really be into tits?  So what it is is she's really not into tits.  And that chick, to me, looks like a guy.  So Ellen is really not gay because she likes a guy.  There's so many girls like that that are lesbians.  No, she's not.  She's straight because her girl looks like a guy.  So she's attracted to a guy.  She's straight.  I think her new girl is pretty girly.  Her new girl, she's been with her a long time.  That one?  That's Portia de Rossi.  She's not with Portia anymore?  I thought they broke up.  No! 
[03:17:30]  That was a rumor.  Big rumor.  Big rumor.  All right.  I'm also thinking of it.  It was all cleared up.  His sweater is on backwards.  Check.  Yeah.  Your sweater is on backwards.  So what?  Gallagher would do that.  It looks like he's trying to himself.  Because you wanted me to smash.  Now I get this side dirty, turn it around, and go back out into the world.  I'm going to an afternoon play.  Hey, I'll be on at 2 o'clock.  This guy is thinking ahead.  I'll just take it off.  I'm not even smashing.  You guys are going to smash.  No, I don't want to smash.  I know.  Well, that's not smash. 
[03:18:00]  It's radio.  I don't know.  What the hell are you doing smashing on radio?  Hold on, Gallagher.  I want to talk about your heart, smoking, pot, stress, and the fact that you're going  to die in two years.  I've already done it.  This is all the stuff he said while you were gone smoking there, Bobby.  He's going to die?  Yeah, he's going to die in two years.  What are you going to leave me?  Why two years?  Why is it two years that you're going to die?  Well, 63, I didn't 65.  Probably just about the time I qualified to get some money from the government.  Win that figure, right?  But you've got energy.  It doesn't look like you're going anywhere anytime soon. 
[03:18:30]  I know, but you can't tell with plumbing.  You never know when it's clogged.  I didn't know I was having a heart attack when I had it.  I thought I had indigestion.  I was watching the Lakers.  It was a Sunday.  They were in the playoffs.  I had my two kids over, my son and my daughter.  So I didn't go in until the next day.  And by then, I had a 20% damage to my heart.  So when you look at my heart, 20% of it doesn't get blood and is kind of rotting. 
[03:19:00]  And then after a while, that thins because it goes into your bloodstream.  And so then my heart will start to expand because it'll be pumping, but it'll have a thin wall there.  You know, you have to become a doctor when you get sick, just like you become a lawyer when you get arrested.  Because if you don't know, everywhere you leak, the world hangs a bucket.  That's what I'm telling you.  You've got to know about this shit because otherwise, how can you hire people?  That's fucking brilliant.  And with that, he decided he's done it.  I already did it.  I changed comedy. 
[03:19:30]  I showed people how to do a video with video in it.  I don't know why these comedians don't pay attention.  They wear black in front of a dark curtain.  How schmucky stupid is that?  Then there'll be an art director that'll take credit for the show.  And all they wear was a face and hands floating.  And, you know, if you're going to be on TV, have video things, have visuals, have costumes, have pictures.  You just don't stand up.  You end up a talking head. 
[03:20:00]  Bobby, you're listening.  I'm not a prop comic.  I just knew that you needed him to make videos.  I'm a skilled monologist, as you've seen.  And you're smoking again, which is good.  Well, I can't always find dope.  I asked him.  Wait, you said you've been smoking pot every day since what age?  20.  So that's 43 years.  I was the chief chemist of Allied Chemical.  I got arrested in Tampa, Florida in 1969.  Let me see.  You popped that sumbitch up on your thing. 
[03:20:30]  Let me see.  Police record, Gallagher, Tampa, Florida.  Do you know how to get somebody's police record?  He knows everything.  Danny's good.  Okay, great.  I love having this.  I was one of the first.  And they all showed up at this apartment.  My dad owned a skating rink, and I was with the professionals from the rink that taught.  And there was only six of us on a Saturday night, and there was three levels of law enforcement there, county, city, and state.  And I told them, guys, I said, if you're farting with us, and I was 20 years old at the time. 
[03:21:00]  I said, if you're farting with us, you're not anywhere near handling the marijuana problem in this country.  And they said, why, where is it?  And I said, Traficante, you idiot.  I'm in Tampa, Florida, and Traficante ran the mob out of there.  And, you know, and they're farting around with me.  But I used it to stay out of the draft.  If you have a continuing legal problem, then you didn't get drafted.  My whole life was about the draft for, I guess, 10 years from about when I was 17. 
[03:21:30]  I guess they were done with it about 22.  Maybe it was just five years.  It seemed like 10 years.  And I put braces back on my teeth.  Also, if you have, I went down and I met my draft lady.  I got tired of waiting for her letters.  I said, who in the hell is down here sending me these letters?  When are you sending me another one?  I wasn't even a comedian at the time.  I just convinced her that I wasn't the type of guy to go tromping through the bushes looking for little slant-eyed people who might bend over with a machine gun on their back.  You've got to pick on the enemy. 
[03:22:00]  I do jokes about Arabs, and the people don't laugh because they're afraid politically correct.  And I tell them, they're the enemy.  You don't understand these people.  It gets real hot.  Are you going to put a blanket over your head?  Hell no.  I even tried to figure out them Arab people.  I got their Bible.  It's a kit.  You get a coloring book and a Koran.  And I looked in there to see if it said anything about, they're crazy.  They stole chairs out of the palaces.  They sit on the floor.  Why do they want a chair?  These people are nuts. 
[03:22:30]  And why did they use the same rock Abraham used?  I mean, with all the rocks there are in Israel, why did Mohammed stand there?  600 years later, the schmuck is standing.  Allah, if he was smart, should have said, don't stand there.  That's a Jew rock.  Did you find my police record?  This is the best thing I could do.  Is that you?  No.  No.  I thought there was more.  It's in Nade City, Pasco County, though. 
[03:23:00]  There's a Leo Gallagher who lives in San Diego that gets all of my Avis credits.  He gets all your Avis credits?  Yeah.  There must be a bunch of Leo Gallagher.  Oh, now I've told my name to the world.  You know what they're going to say?  Hey, Leo.  Hey, Leo.  Hey, Leo.  On the way to the stage.  That's what they're going to do.  Just to piss me off.  Oh, damn it.  That's not good.  Just to piss me off.  But I am a Leo.  Did you see my birthday, July 24th?  You won't find anybody whose astrological sign and name are the same.  Do you know anybody named Sagittarius? 
[03:23:30]  No.  I'm the only one.  Because it's the only name in there.  Leo Anthony Gallagher, Jr.  Named because my dad wasn't creative and thought, well, we'll just use mine.  That's why they called me Butch.  My name was Butch.  You know, that's why names are important.  I'm so against these girls having boy names.  Jesse, Jamie, Jody.  Used to be predominantly boy names.  But I signed autographs.  And the girls are using them now.  Tony, even.  They took the Y, which is masculine and has a thing hanging down. 
[03:24:00]  And they put an I there.  And they make it.  It's butching.  They're butching up all the girls.  And then if you're confused about your name, then you don't live up to your potential.  Because you don't know, am I a girl?  Am I a boy?  That always affected guys named Chris.  I'm sure.  You know, Ashley was the guy in Gone with the Wind.  And now it's girls all the time.  Yeah.  Oh, Ashley.  Didn't you ever see Gone with the Wind?  Oh, no.  Why would Ash?  Yeah, it was a guy.  Well, you think Ash's name is from Evil Dead.  Betty was a wonderful name. 
[03:24:30]  Betty was the pinup in World War II.  Every Betty I meets an old bitch on oxygen, like I told you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's an old lady's name.  Well, it was a beautiful name.  Olivia, Evelyn, what's the matter?  Well, I can understand not doing that one.  Gertie.  Yeah.  Or Hortense.  Yeah.  I don't know why people were named that.  Mildred.  Mildred.  Mildred, yeah.  But they're all like Brittany, Chelsea, Heather, Nikki.  N-I-K-K-I.  Yeah.  What about the girls named after cars?  Porsche.  Porsche. 
[03:25:00]  Nothing.  Mercedes.  Is Porsche French?  Oh, shit.  See, I don't want that.  I'm tired of it.  You can't go out to eat without speaking French.  Let's break shit.  Well, think about the French one.  You break stuff.  If you're mad, it goes further.  He don't want to do it.  It's like...  You don't want to do it.  We set up the studio.  Well, you can do it.  How about you smack it?  You smack it.  You smack it.  You don't want to do yesterday.  McCartney doesn't want to play yesterday.  I'm just telling you, why clean it up?  We smash shit, because we have interns.  We don't clean it up.  None of us clean it up. 
[03:25:30]  Who cares?  Well, you've got your papers, your electronic equipment.  No, we've got a whole other wall that goes up.  Show them the other wall.  We're the boys.  You can smack.  Bobby will smash.  I smacked the last time.  See, I have a smaller hammer.  I actually want to see you...  Oh, you do?  I mean, I've never...  Oh, it's like this.  I want to see you do it.  Back and down.  But I want to see you do it.  It's not even going to fit.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Well, I jack off, too, and I ain't showing you.  It's going to hit the ceiling, too.  The hammer's going to hit the ceiling.  No, it won't hit the ceiling.  It comes out at the level of the table.  Gallagher, I say we do. 
[03:26:00]  No, I mean...  And then you come back and we don't have to smash anything.  Is this video going to be on your website?  Are you going to make me pay for it?  No.  I mean, the hammer will hit the ceiling.  I want to know, is there any reason to do something visual?  I got the HD flip.  You have a tiny little camera.  This thing kicks ass.  Look, do you think it's going to help me to get jobs for my girlfriend's daughter?  Well, I already posted that video.  You did post the video?  On OP Radio on Twitter.  I owe you.  All right, I'll do it.  You're showing the...  If I get that bitch a job, I'm...  That video's up there. 
[03:26:30]  It's doing well, Gallagher.  A couple thousand views already.  Really?  Yes.  A couple thousand.  This is what we do.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  So let's smash some stuff.  All right.  Let me down...  I'm going to move over there.  A banana won't go.  Now, the thing that's going to go the furthest and ruin everything is the cottage cheese.  See, to really smash, you need to have two elements.  And I learned this from the Arabs.  You need dynamite in the middle, surrounded by shrapnel.  Now, the shrapnel has to be aerodynamic.  It can't be a lightweight thing.  Now, when we smack the cottage cheese, the curds will go flying, just like on the news. 
[03:27:00]  And the little melon with the seeds, now that's going to work really good.  But the seeds go flying.  If you put cream of mushroom soup around the edge of your pie and then put peas in the middle, it wouldn't work.  You put your mushroom soup in the middle and your peas around the outside is the way it works.  You see?  I've made a study of this.  And also, you want to put it in a pie pan, but we don't have any pie pans here today.  You guys just asked me to bring my hammer. 
[03:27:30]  I thought we were just going to show it or something.  I didn't realize we were going to do it exactly.  I got a spot over there?  The whole thing that we did the last time.  What about Gallagher's mic?  I don't need a mic.  I'm just going to smack.  We're going to be in an area.  In an area?  I'm not.  It's going to stay here.  I'm sitting right here.  Hey, I think people should try to guess what we smacked by the sound.  Now, that's a fun thing.  He's always thinking.  That's a fun thing.  He's always thinking.  Bobby, you're going to go in there?  I'm going to stand here.  Here's the wall, though. 
[03:28:00]  You're not going to be able to see anything.  See the wall.  See right through it.  Is this my coffee from in the office?  Yeah.  I'll smack my coffee.  Is it?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll smack my coffee.  All right.  Get the goddamn plastic up.  Okay.  I'm going to go in.  You sure you're not going in there?  Oh, you're holding the plastic.  I see.  All right.  I'm not going in.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me get in there.  I'm not going in there.  You don't want to be in here when I smack the coffee.  You're going to be a mess.  Oh, what the hell?  Give me some headphones.  Is this mic on? 
[03:28:30]  You guys are going to be a fucking mess.  Okay.  Here comes the coffee.  God, wait.  Things didn't move along and now you're stopping me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have to play.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here's your mic.  Where's your camera?  Hold on.  Here's your mic.  Where's your camera?  Wait a minute.  Get your camera ready.  Hold on.  Oh, wait a minute.  Get your camera ready.  Is my mic on?  And I can't even hear you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can hear you.  All right.  I can hear you.  All right.  Wait.  Wait.  Gallagher.  We're going to start with the watermelon.  All right.  We got Gallagher.  We're going to start with the watermelon. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, shit.  You sound like a fucking bomb.  What the hell are you going to do?  Then we're going to go to the pineapple, which isn't as good.  That was right.  Too hard.  It's too hard.  You see this bullshit?  You don't want that.  Okay.  What's this?  This one's not going to work too good either.  It's some kind of yellow thing.  Oh, shit.  He knows the chest.  He knows.  It's really the more watery thing works better.  Watermelon.  And cottage cheese.  No, no, no.  I don't want the cottage cheese.  We're going to take the top off of the college. 
[03:29:30]  No, I don't want the cottage cheese.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus.  In the package.  Now I'll do my coffee.  Jesus.  It's actually my coffee.  It's better than some of us.  People think this is going to go good.  Yeah, what is this?  It won't.  See?  Ah, see?  They ruined that.  They ruined that one.  It'll need a half a thing, and it goes down.  But God is good in pie!  All right, wait a minute. 
[03:30:00]  We can't do the pie.  Let's not do the pie.  Now I'm going to just hit half of the pie so the other half flies out.  It's going to shoot at me or what?  I'm going to hit right there.  All right, here we go.  The pie.  Ready for pie!  Pie!  Holy shit.  That makes a hell of a racket.  You suck.  Oh, it got on your head, Bobby?  Oh, it's got to be like completely fucking drenched in this shit.  Let me see. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, he's a fucking mess.  Holy shit, Gallagher, you're a wreck, too.  What happened?  What the fuck, Gallagher?  He's fucked up my flip.  Smells delicious, like a fruit salad in here.  And coffee, though.  That kind of ruined it.  You are a mess, Opie.  Your fucking shirt and everything.  Look at you.  You're a disaster. 
[03:31:00]  Wow, look at that.  Yeah, that really...  Hey, auction that off.  You know what?  I'm amazed at Gallagher.  Let me sign that, and then we'll auction it off for charity, and then all of the dots mean something.  He knows exactly what is going to work and what isn't.  Over the years, he's figured it out.  What is this?  It's charity.  Ew, what is that?  I'm allergic to cherries.  Nah, you're not eating this.  It's cherries for charity.  Oh, God.  You are a fucking mess.  No, I'll show you a fucking mess if you come to my show. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't smack anything really gooey.  Yeah, yeah.  I smacked mayonnaise, mustard, cream of mushroom soup, honey, and cactus.  Oh, honey.  Cactus is snotty.  When I saw about the Straspberry, he smacked full jugs of, like, orange juice, like chocolate syrup.  Like, it's some serious shit that goes on over there.  The gallon bottle is extremely explosive.  You owe me for this shirt.  No, you're going to use it.  You're going to put it on the internet. 
[03:32:00]  This is one of my better shirts, Gallagher.  Only you would wear a white shirt to a Gallagher thing.  Really?  I'll wear my white shirt.  Gallagher's coming in.  Oh, Kenny, yes.  You're taking a cab home.  You're not getting in my truck.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  This will freak out Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  My truck is sanitized.  Then why is it a truck?  If you're such a sissy, why did you get a truck?  This is the problem with America.  Oh, you're going to take that.  Truck doesn't mean anything.  And it ends in a K, too. 
[03:32:30]  He's going to be dead in two years.  Let him.  Oh, shit.  Well, he said it.  Yeah.  Kenny, look, I cleaned off.  I don't want to be old and bent over.  Then you're pitiful.  And then you can't remember your act, too.  I hate that one.  I used to go and see that comedian that said Pearl Bailey attacked on December the Jackie...  The Joke Man?  Kathy Marlin?  No, he used to say December 7th he was attacked by Pearl Bailey. 
[03:33:00]  I can't remember his name.  No, I can't remember anything.  Jackie Schultz?  I look good now.  You do look good.  Look good.  But he would say the same joke over in his show and everybody would think, oh, isn't that pitiful?  Here he goes.  Yeah, same old piece of shit joke.  It's terrible.  You know, because jokes are a surprise.  Of course.  And then if you've already said it.  That's why I don't like to do two shows in one night.  I can't remember if I said it in the first show or the first part of this show.  So, I like to just do one show a night because I'm... 
[03:33:30]  Once again, God screws you up.  You know, like eyesight.  I used to be able to see, now I can't see.  Of course, it's kind of cool when I look at chicks because they have four tits now.  But four eyes, too, and two noses.  You know, I went to see Catherine Zeta-Jones and I really couldn't make out her face.  And I had a...  I was in J1, too.  Here's my ticket.  Oh.  I like to prove things, you know, because the whole world's so full of shit.  He's showing you his ticket.  But then I got a picture of her coming out the stage door.  A hundred and thirty-two dollars? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Dollars?  Yeah.  Bobby, you weren't in there with me.  You suck.  One of these, one of them, one of them.  Oh, look at Gallagher's...  What's in that pocket?  Gallagher's pulling out some fucking...  Some cash.  Yeah, I'm a comedian.  No, you gotta carry around cash these days.  I don't...  What's in that pocket?  I might run into drugs.  No, the...  My credit cards?  No, the one that's jingling.  You have a bunch of jingly stuff. 
[03:34:30]  I know it.  I have all this.  Change?  Yeah, in case I have to fight.  Then I reach in there and I got metal in my hand.  And then I can punch.  Good luck with that.  I got a hammer.  Who's going to mess with me on the street?  Well, that's true.  He's got a big hammer.  I got a hammer.  Everybody looks at me and decides, no, I'm leaving him alone.  I took the subway in from JFK.  With the hammer?  Yeah.  Security didn't get you?  No.  No.  Nobody else on the train bothered me either.  Gallagher's a terrorist with a big fucking hammer. 
[03:35:00]  I get respect on the streets of New York.  As he's got watermelon on the side of his face.  Gallagher, you're coming back, right?  You know, it ain't the way you pick your nose.  It's where you put the booger.  In your mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  It's all about stuff.  Oh, I'm the only one that eats boogers.  Okay.  You know, people say to eat before you go to the grocery store.  That way you don't buy so much.  Well, that don't work with the liquor store.  All right, Gallagher.  Jesus.  You're coming back tomorrow. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Leave him laughing.  That's why we're saying you're coming back tomorrow.  Leave him laughing.  We've got to go to a meeting.  Hey, do you know why there isn't a Six Flags in Mexico City?  Why?  Because you have to be that tall to ride to ride.  See, they're all short people.  Of course they are.  Yeah.  Well, it was a visual.  I had to kind of have that one home for him.  Not for me.  All right, Gallagher, you're definitely going to come back either tomorrow or Friday.  It's up to you, right?  Yeah.  And what do we have to promote?  Big deal.  I just have to drive to Danbury, Connecticut on Friday. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You're not even doing a gig until Friday.  That's what I said.  January 8th, Gallagher, Treehouse Comedy Club, Danbury, Connecticut.  January 9th, Asbury Park, New Jersey, The Stone Pony.  January 10th, Bill Moore, The Brokerage Club out there on Long Island.  I used to work Westbury Music for, I'd do two or three shows and it's seated thousands.  How great was that?  I'd make $100,000 in a weekend.  How great was that?  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Those were the days, huh?  Where's that money?  Good old days.  And Danny saw Gallagher last time he was in town at the Stress Factory. 
[03:36:30]  It's just a great show.  Danny's just a really funny show.  It's a great show.  Definitely enjoy yourself.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a spring plastic.  Some people say it's the most fun they ever had.  How can you miss that?  You know my videos were used in cancer research to see if when you release endorphins, you  could fight disease.  Did it work?  They used my videos as the source of the laughter.  I'm so proud.  You can look that up.  They could use Rich Voss' videos for something.  Let me see.  What hospital did I get cancer?  Oh, shoot.  People just fucking kill them.  I can't remember the hospital. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  Listen, we're going to go, Gallagher.  We're going to figure it all out.  All right.  We're going to come back.  Bob Kelly, you should come back, too.  Yeah.  I'll come back.  We'll just make it a party for the rest of the week.  We've got Patrice tomorrow as well.  It's tricky.  But if Bobby doesn't come back, make sure you check him out at the Gotham Comedy Club  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday here in New York City.  Yeah.  That's it.  What does Gotham mean?  Gallagher.  We'll talk about Gotham.  What does Knickerbocker mean?  I don't like any of these names.  We have to clean up the whole studio before the next show gets here, so we really do have  to get out of here.  What's this we shit? 
[03:37:30]  Not me.  You were.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Nah, nah. </pre>
