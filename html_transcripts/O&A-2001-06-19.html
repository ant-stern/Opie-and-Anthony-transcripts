<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a contentious phone call featuring aggressive and insulting language directed at a female caller.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing one host's white shirt, generating jokes about his appearance.  Listener feedback followed, primarily negative reactions from Chicago listeners to a Harry Carey impression that contained references to bisexuality and pedophilia.  A call with Gary, the program director of their Chicago affiliate WCKG, ensued, addressing the backlash and the hosts' provocative intent.  Further negative calls arrived from Philadelphia and Chicago, prompting debates about their similarity to Howard Stern and defending their style.  A recurring gag involved listeners insulting the show while simultaneously revealing their continued listenership. A bet was placed with one listener, Joe, regarding the show's Philadelphia run.  This segment also included a humorous, offensive Babe Ruth impersonation from hell, filled with crude jokes and references to alcohol, sex, and deceased celebrities.  The hosts then discussed their syndication, anticipating negative reactions in upcoming cities like Dallas, and promoted a Philadelphia "Babe Fest."  Listeners self-identified with various show archetypes, leading to humorous interactions and recruitment for future contributions. The segment concluded with a discussion of Gene Simmons' Kiss merchandise, including coffins, and a guest appearance by radio personality Eddie Trunk. Joe, the initially insulting caller, remained on hold for a significant portion.

The show continued with a discussion about a controversial "female money shot" scene from *Sex and the City*, which the hosts, Opie, Anthony, Ben, and Rick, heavily criticized, using vulgar language to describe the scene and the woman involved.  This transitioned into a lengthy critique of *Caddyshack*, focusing on their dislike of Lacey Underall's character and her attractiveness throughout various films.  The conversation was filled with crude and sexually explicit descriptions.  Several listener calls briefly agreed with the hosts' negative opinions or offered their own critiques.  Professional wrestlers Al Snow and Taz from the WWF were in studio.  The conversation shifted to their careers, the upcoming MTV show *Tough Enough*, and an anecdote of Taz's unexpected studio entrance and confrontation with a hungover Ben (played back as audio).  Mick Foley then called in, discussing his book and relationship with Al Snow, sharing humorous anecdotes about their wrestling careers, including some involving accidental genital exposure. The segment concluded with promotional announcements for sponsors and live Opie and Anthony events. Stephen Lynch was also in studio and performed a song about dating a hermaphrodite.

A subsequent segment heavily featured the hosts' childhood experiences with *The Flintstones*' voice actor changes, evoking strong emotional reactions from Anthony.  This transitioned into further promotion of *Tough Enough*, with Al Snow and Taz providing details.  A phone interview with Barbara Kiesling, author of "The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex," followed, involving sexually explicit and vulgar conversation about female sexuality.  The discussion included detailed descriptions of sexual acts and crude exchanges.  The interview concluded with more *Tough Enough* promotion.  The segment was characterized by profanity, interruptions, and off-topic tangents, with several caller participations contributing to the chaotic and sexually charged atmosphere.

The final excerpt focused on the hosts' upcoming syndicated show appearance at Mulcahy's with Dr. Dirty and John Belby, alongside extensive advertisement for Stacker 2.  Numerous phone calls occurred, including sexually explicit banter with Anthony, a caller recounting a traffic stop, and several contributing to the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, recapping the show's outrageous moments.  Al Snow and Taz were again in studio, leading to physical and verbal confrontations, including Taz allegedly hitting Opie in the groin, and discussions regarding a perceived slight against Taz by Rick.  Old Dirty, the show's "street rep," provided running commentary about stolen goods and phone card scams.  The segment also addressed Rick's alleged habit of feeding the hosts lines.  The show concluded with promotional announcements and a Samsung DVD player giveaway, maintaining its informal, vulgar, and chaotic tone.

[00:01:30]  Domino's?  What are you talking about?  See, now you're going to make me explain.  You got, like, Domino's stuff on, like the Domino's shirt.  Pizza?  What?  No, like you're doing the Domino's.  The game.  Domino's.  I got a light, light-colored, airy, nice, cotton-white shirt.  Did it just come off the cricket field?  Over.  It's summer.  I'm wearing nice summer attire.  What? 
[00:02:00]  What's the matter?  It's a lovely shirt.  Where's the hat that goes with it?  Why?  What the...  You're such a tool, man.  I don't know.  It just looks like you should be playing Domino's in a park somewhere.  That's all.  What?  Like the Puerto Ricans do?  Rick, is that true?  It's very true, dude.  You look like you dress like my uncle, for Christ's sakes.  Really?  Down in Little Havana?  Somewhere?  Out in Brooklyn.

I'm just used to you wearing, I don't know, concert t-shirts and Jack Daniel t-shirts.  To occasion, it was a nice, warm day.  I decided to break out some summer wear.  What?  You don't like it?  It looks fine.  I got, like, it's nice and airy.  It breathes.  It breathes.  It got it at Banana Republic. 
[00:03:00]  It's a hat.  I can picture the straw hat.  That's what I'm saying.  It looks like the big white straw hat.  You should be wearing the Banana Republic hat.  Like the guys that work in the sugar cane fields.  There you go.  And you look great, okay?  Gee, thanks.  I hope coming from you, that means absolutely effing-lutely nothing.  You know, toll-free, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  We got our first call from Chicago, Anthony.  Hey.  Let's talk to Buzz.  Buzz, what's going on?  Hello, sir?  Hey, Buzz.  Yeah, I am.  Hey, turn that down.  Did you hear Anthony and Opie? 
[00:03:30]  No, I kind of heard them and turned it off.  Really?  Out of, I mean, what?  Out of boredom.  Really?  Nothing competes to you guys.  Come on.  Well, they're very juvenile.  A very bad Harry Carey impression.  In New York, they don't really care if it's a good impression of Harry Carey.  They really suck.  Hello, sir.  Hey, Buzz.  Yeah, I am.  Who is that?  Oh, you didn't have to hang up.  We were to talk to you.  He was doing a little prank there.  Who was that?  I have no idea.  Someone in Chicago will help us out with that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, welcome. 
[00:04:00]  Welcome, Chicago.  We have other radio stations in Chicago already talking about us.  Nice.  Want to say hi to everyone at WCKG, Anthony?  Yeah.  Thanks for the pizza today.  Deep dish style today.  The Chicago deep dish.  Every city's got their little product.  So someone help me out.  Who's Buzz?  Is that like another DJ up in Chicago?  I don't know who that was, hoping.  I don't know what the clip was.  The guy should have explained what he was doing.  Yeah, I hate that.  When they just call up and do that, you hang out and talk. 
[00:04:30]  He was probably like, I better hang up on them before.  They hang up on me.  We're not going to hang up on you.  Well, we've been on in Chicago for exactly one show so far.  One show.  Here's the start of the second show.  And man, do we have some hate mail.  Yeah.  Oh, Buzz and Wendy?  I guess so.  Maybe.  Buzz and Wendy from WCKG.  They're already calling us Duveno?  Was that them or was it just...  We should call our fine program director at WCKG and then he'll explain exactly what that 
[00:05:00]  was about so we can all be in on the joke.  I'm sure he will explain.  A lot of people pissed off about the Harry Carey that started off the show yesterday.  What's the problem with that?  It's all in fun.  I'm just going through some of the email and some of the message boards.  Steve Dahl has a message board, www.dahl.com, D-A-H-L.com.  Uh-huh.  And this came off his message board.  It's about you and I, of course.  Of course.  After accidentally hearing some of their show last night, accidentally, I tripped and 
[00:05:30]  hit the radio.  I couldn't believe that CKG's management actually thought these guys had talent.  Or maybe I could.  And then it goes on.  And is it really a smart thing to do on your first night in Chicago to have some really  lame comic on who is making Harry Carey jokes and making him out to be bisexual and  a pedophile?  See, it's cactus.  Not only is Harry a Chicago institution, but he's also dead.  Have some respect, you morons.  At least their local Harry impersonator does it with a sense of affection for the man. 
[00:06:00]  Suck it.  That Harry Carey yesterday was hilarious.  We were talking to the program director.  Can we get him on the air?  Uh-oh.  I'll see.  I'll check.  Hold on.  They had a conference call with him?  Yeah.  You could tell he was already sweating on the other side of the phone.  Yeah.  Because, well, that Harry Carey thing with him, you know, on his knees in front of a glory  hole.  That was kind of interesting.  Kind of interesting.  For the guy's first show in Chicago. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, get up.  Give me a break.  I don't think he's as up to date on what the show is about as Tim is in Philly.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I think he's got to get a little more up to speed on what's happening on this program.  So, no surprise, Anthony.  Chicago already hates us.  It's only been one day.  One show.  One show in Chicago.  And they've already learned things.  We don't respect the dead.  We really don't care about any institution. 
[00:07:00]  That doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter what city it is.  Right.  We don't care.  Ben from Philly.  He wants to tell us we suck as well.  Ben, go ahead.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  You guys blow.  Thank you.  So, why are you still listening after a week and a half in Philadelphia?  Because I finally, I just turned you guys on.  I got your phone number.  I've been waiting for your phone number because you guys suck so bad.  Well, we put it out there every day.  You could have called maybe day two and said, that's it.  I'm not listening.  But you're still listening. 
[00:07:30]  So, Ben, how many of these sucky shows have you listened to so far?  That's probably about the third time I've listened.  I keep hoping it's going to get better.  This is all you get.  This is all you get, pal.  Well, I really hope they pull the plug on you guys because you guys suck.  Well, Ben, what do you find funny?  What's that?  What do you find funny?  Something other than this.  What they had on was perfectly fine before.  It was music.  The same 20 songs that you've heard a million times in your life. 
[00:08:00]  What do you do for fun?  I mean, you have Stern on in the morning.  You guys are copying him.  Well, that old gag.  Hey, Ben, let me tell you something.  Wait, wait.  Do you want to discuss this or do you want to just babble and then we'll hang up on you?  I'm listening.  Go ahead.  The whole we're copying Stern thing, that is so old it's not even funny.  Get over that part of it, first of all, okay?  Okay.  Because if you give us a chance, you'll find out that we're much different than Howard.  Okay.  You stupid idiot. 
[00:08:30]  Where are you guys from?  You guys from where, LA?  No, we're from New York.  You're from New York?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'll give you...  Get rid of him.  He'll keep listening.  It's hysterical.  All right.  Let's talk to the program director of WCKG.  Ah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  Welcome to Chicago.  Thank you.  Gary, are you sure of that?  Absolutely, man.  All right.  Well...  Absolutely.  Thanks for sending all the hate mail down.  We appreciate that.  It was asked for. 
[00:09:00]  There was a positive one in there.  Come on, guys.  Oh, there was?  Yeah.  Jeremy probably didn't give it to you.  No, he didn't.  No, I got kind of discouraged after about 200 of them, and I just threw them all away.  You know what?  I didn't send you guys all the positive email when the rumor was out that we were going to  have you of all the people that were so excited about your show coming.  So...  And that outweighed that, trust me.  Yeah.  So does Wendy think we're juvenile already?  I don't think you guys are juvenile.  It was a lot of fun.  Ah, you didn't answer the question.  Oh, oh.  Was she calling us juvenile today on her show? 
[00:09:30]  Who, Wendy?  Yeah.  I did not hear that.  You know what?  Honestly, I sincerely doubt it.  I mean, I heard some things that people calling in yesterday, you know, accusing other people  on our station talking about you.  But we're kind of a big family here, and we all kind of live on the edge, and you guys  are just the two newest guys.  We didn't believe the Steve Dahl stuff.  Oh, absolutely.  You're referring to some guy who called up and said Dahl was already trashing you guys.  Yeah.  And I was surprised because we met him in Boston, and he was nothing but cool type.  Oh, he was very excited about having you guys on the station. 
[00:10:00]  Unlike a lot of stations, as I put in an email to Jeremy yesterday, we're kind of like  a family.  We don't pee in the pool.  Right.  So, you know, we're all in it together, and we're having fun.  And that's the take we've got on it.  So, we're thrilled to death, and there was a lot of good feedback.  There was a lot of good calls on the show last night, too.  There you go.  But Buzz and Wendy already called us juvenile, and they didn't think our Harry Carey was  that good.  Well, you know what?  Honestly, the Harry Carey was decent, but we've got so many guys in here in Chicago that  do perfect Harry Carey.  We're kind of spoiled by it. 
[00:10:30]  But who puts them in front of a glory hole?  Okay.  Yeah.  There's the Harry.  That's the difference between our Harry Carey and our radio show.  and other radio shows.  And absolutely.  Everyone knows it's not being juvenile to be in front of a glory hole, so that's more  of a dirty old man thing.  We figured we'd shock Chicago and put Harry Carey in front of a glory hole.  Day one.  Way to go, guys.  You know what?  Maybe Wendy's right.  We are juvenile.  Hey.  I'm juvenile, too, and I'm in my 40s, so everyone can deal with it.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  Welcome to Chicago, guys.  Hey, thanks, Gary.  Did you get the pizza we sent today?  Yes, we appreciate that.  All right.  Thank you.  We just want you to eat well.  Yes, thanks.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  There he goes.  The program director of our Chicago affiliate WCKG.  There it is.  Oh, brother, they never learn.  It's a whole.  I don't even want to go over the process.  It's a process.  Happened here.  Philly already.  A week later.  Turning around.  Getting a lot of people emailing and instant feedback and phone calls from Philly. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey.  Just letting you guys know, I've been listening for, you know, the past two weeks now, and  you guys definitely differ.  I was skeptical the first day, you know, but it definitely grew on me, and you guys are  very different in Howard Stern, whatever that guy says.  We don't even play that game because we just know.  I mean, you can ask any of our New York listeners.  We don't even discuss that anymore, and this is Howard's backyard.  We do our thing.  He does his thing.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's an hour in the morning, and if you're right, the same 20 songs over and over again 
[00:12:00]  in the afternoon, definitely a better change of pace.  Yeah.  I'm very happy, yeah.  All right.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thanks, Jim.  Thanks, Jim.  Take care.  Hey, you want to go to Babe Fest down there in Philly?  Sure.  All right.  Hold on to the line, man.  Cool.  Babe Fest is going to be huge this Thursday in Philadelphia.  See, it's a whole process.  So now Philly, after day one, I remember 15 minutes on the air in Philly.  We were getting phone calls.  Get off.  You suck.  Now, it's kind of hard to judge something after 15 minutes, but it happens.  We know that.  And then after a couple of weeks, you start kind of getting into it. 
[00:12:30]  Our show, crack.  It's like crack.  Philly, definitely starting to turn a little bit.  Yeah.  And now Chicago.  Well, we'll start getting positive Chicago phone calls in about two weeks from now.  We know that.  It takes a couple of weeks.  And this is what sucks as we roll out syndication across America.  Yeah.  Every freaking week, we're going to have to deal with the hate calls from a new city.  Right when we start feeling good about the previous city, finally starting to catch on.  Right.  We just get thrown right back into it with the you suck, get off, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:13:00]  Dallas is next.  Yeah.  Dallas starts next Monday.  And then they'll start calling and writing and saying how much they hate us.  And they'll suck with an accent.  And then they'll have other jocks on their radio station, you know, saying that we're immature and juvenile.  Mm-hmm.  But we're making people talk about us.  That's what we're all about.  It's all about.  We got some great Sammy Sosa bits today and Michael Jordan bits in front of glory halls.  We know Harry Carrey's an institution, a dead institution in Chicago. 
[00:13:30]  And I thought Jay Moore did a great impression of Harry Carrey.  It's kind of a caricature.  We make fun of our own institutions right here in New York.  Yeah.  Babe Ruth.  Babe Ruth.  Where's Babe Ruth from hell?  Big, fat, drunk, womanizer.  Babe Ruth.  Who cares?  Babe Ruth calls us from hell every once in a while. 
[00:14:00]  We love Babe Ruth.  You know he's burning in hell.  We love the guy.  But, what, hands off?  Harry Carrey, hands off?  Even though we love the guy, we can still goof on him, right?  All right, this is Babe Ruth from hell.  Just to give Chicago an idea that we...  Tom Landry, flaming fan.  Well, we'll get into that next Monday.  See, you're brave now to say that.  I know.  Because we're not on in Dallas.  I dare you say that next Monday, Anthony.  I heard that he used to take that hat off just to catch the splooge at the glory hole. 
[00:14:30]  Is that true?  We'll find out.  Write that down.  Rick, write that down.  He does not have the kahunas to say that.  We'll be live in Dallas next Monday.  Oh, Rick, everyone knows all the cowboys are criminals.  You want to hear Babe Ruth from hell?  All right, here's a New York institution.  Here's another juvenile bit, the Bambino, that Wendy can make fun of tomorrow.  Buzz and Wendy at WCKG in Chicago.  Listen up.  Yo, Babe! 
[00:15:00]  How you doing?  It's Babe Ruth live from hell, everyone.  How you doing?  You got any whores there for me?  You all right, Babe?  Yeah, I'm in hell.  How all right could I be?  They got me coaching a little league team down here.  You're coaching little league in hell?  Little f***ers can't even play.  Or drink.  They're not even interested in whores like I was. 
[00:15:30]  By the time I was six, I was knocking them down left and right.  A bottle of booze in one hand.  This is our cigarette in the other.  Wow, dear.  You know, they invented the voice box just for me.  Yes, I know that.  The electric voice box.  It was actually an accident.  What do you mean?  Well, some chick I was with was using a dildo. 
[00:16:00]  And I accidentally went down on her and realized I could talk.  Come on, you little f***er.  Hit the ball.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  F*** you.  Hey, Babe, have you seen your pal Lou Gehrig down there in hell?  No, that pussy was a good guy.  He went up to heaven. 
[00:16:30]  He did, huh?  Yeah.  He died of that Lou Gehrig disease, you know.  Yeah.  Jeez, what are the odds of that?  Hey, nice thing, you little prick.  Hey, we're going to get together with Billy Martin and Michael Kennedy tonight for happy hour.  Oh, really?  Billy's driving.  Billy's driving.  You just see Michael's face.  It looks like my larynx.  Jesus.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Whoa, whoa, what's wrong, Babe?  Babe.  I just spilled a beer in my voice, Pop.  My wife's going to kill me.  Wait, Babe, you're married?  I did say I was in hell, you know.  Babe, babe.  Babe, babe.  Oh, there he goes.  Babe Ruth, everyone.  God.  Opie and Anthony.

[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Anthony from West Orange.  The O&A show is getting passed around like a drunk freshman at a frat party.  There you go.  Well, it's not for everyone.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Put the music back on.  It's the best thing I heard on your show in a week.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So why are you still listening, Joe?  Yeah.  What?  Well, it's not that I'm listening.  It's like I'm changing stations, you know?  No, no, no, Joe.  No, I changed stations.  Joe, Joe, Joe, you're listening.  No, I'm not.  You just happened to come across us again and then went out of your way to make a toll-free  call to New York?  Actually, no. 
[00:20:00]  I got your phone number from my brother who called up and said you guys blow, so I thought  I'd call up and say the same thing.  You guys suck.  Okay.  All right, Joe.  You're horrible.  But you're still listening, Joe, aren't you?  No, I'm really not, honestly.  Okay.  I listen to Y100 in Philly.  I bet you're listening to it, Joe.  Y100.  That's the only radio station you can listen to a song.  Y100, WMMR, you can name whatever radio station you want.  I don't care about it.  No, I usually listen to Y100, but ever since the music's gone, there's no point.  I listen to Howard all morning, so why do you guys got to copy him?  You're not all that old.  He's probably really pissed with you, too.  You don't have a CD player? 
[00:20:30]  Copping his deal.  No, I got plenty of CD players.  Joe, that's an old gag, obviously.  Copping his deal.  Obviously, you're new to the show, so you don't really understand that yet, but we'll explain.  I'm not new to the show.  No, no, Joe.  Why are you cursing, Joe?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Me here.  No, you're a new listener to the show, and you'll call us in about a month or so and say,  wow, man, you guys have grown on me.  Let's have a wager.  No, I don't need to make a wager.  Come on.  Let's have a wager.  I don't need to make a wager.  Come on.  You will be listening to this show a month from now.  You'll know it yourself.  And then you'll be pissed at yourself. 
[00:21:00]  You're like, son of a gun.  I didn't want to like these guys, but I like these guys.  I will come up there and bow to you if I listen to your show more than five seconds in the next few months.  No, see, Joe, because that's another thing.  We don't like people kissing our asses.  No, I'll bow to you.  I won't kiss your ass.  Well, we like people to be honest, and I would guarantee that you've been tuning us in almost every day.  No, honestly, I haven't.  I heard you one time.  I would say the first time I turned on to listen to some music on the way home from work.  And it was so fantastically bad.  You know, I thought you were these guys out of Philly, Matt and Huggy.  I thought you were on, like, kind of doing something and then going to hit some music, and then you just kept babbling on. 
[00:21:30]  Matt and Huggy?  Yeah.  No music.  Yeah.  Joe, you listen.  Put me back on hold and put that music back on, because that was the best thing I heard all day on your show.  Was that supposed to get to us, Joe?  No.  Because that was really bad.  No, it's not supposed to get to you.  I know you're listening to us, because when I'm in my car and I don't like something on the radio, you know what?  I don't listen anymore, but I don't go out of my way to call and tell them how much they suck.  You don't?  After three, like, seconds that you said you listened, you felt compelled. 
[00:22:00]  It was that big an impression of subtitude on you that you felt compelled to call?  You guys need to listen, because Constructive Christmas, I listened about a week ago, okay?  About a week ago.  About a week ago, and then my brother just called you to tell you how much you suck.  How do you know your brother called?  Because he just called me and told me.  Wow.  He's an idiot.  Your whole family's obsessed with the Opie and Anthony show.  Look at this.  The family's calling.  They're calling each other to say they called.  See, Joe, the difference between your family and my family, my family has a life.  We don't need to call each other to tell each other what we hate. 
[00:22:30]  And you should call the radio station, because I don't like them, so you should call to tell  them you don't like them as well.  Well, you know, that's actually what our job is.  We sit around all day in our house.  Actually, we live in a trailer.  Hey, Joe, you're a loser.  We've been in a trailer all day long.  Joe, you're a loser.  No, I know that.  And my dad's a loser, too.  Go through the process, Anthony.  This guy, you heard us a week ago.  Yeah.  And now...  It was the first day you were on in Philly.  And now a week later, you're finally calling to tell us how much we suck.  Yeah, because I can't stand there on the radio, still.  And, Joe, don't you feel it's a little weird that your brother's calling you, and you're 
[00:23:00]  calling us, and he's calling us, and it's all because...  Do you have a brother?  ...the split second that you found something sucked?  Hey, Opie.  Do you have big Opie ears?  Do you have a brother, too?  Big Opie ears?  Yeah.  Was that supposed to get to me, Joe?  No.  Big Dopey ears?  No, you're not going to get me crazy.  I'll tell you that right now.  Hey, Joe, where can I listen to your radio show?  Because, man, that was so witty.  I got to hear everything you say every day.  I'm not trying to be witty.  I'm going to call my brother and tell him I talk to Joe.  No, you only got to tell me you guys all want to copy Howard and be like Howard, you know? 
[00:23:30]  You grow your long hair, too?  You growing your hair long?  Yeah, we're just like Howard, you idiot.  You growing your hair long?  Hey, Joe, can I have your number so my brother can call you to tell you how much you suck,  too?  Yeah, absolutely.  You want my number?  Yeah, give me your phone number.  Yeah, take me off the air.  I'll give it to you.  Ah, yeah, you're a pussy.  What?  Give out your phone number.  I want my phone number.  If you have the balls, you'll give out your phone number live on the radio.  Let's go.  Yeah, I'm not stupid.  But Pussy or Anthony or M.B. or whoever the hell you are.  We suck.  We only have three listeners. 
[00:24:00]  You'll only get three calls.  I don't want three calls.  Well, Joe, you convinced us.  Yeah, we're going to quit this whole thing tomorrow.  No, no, no.  Don't quit the whole thing.  Just, you know, stay in New York and, you know.  No, we've got enough people in Philly digging the show so far.  That's all that matters.  Well, I bet you you're not on by Labor Day.  And you know?  You want to bet?  Yeah.  All right, that we'll take.  We'll take that bet.  Okay.  Well, unless you took a year of contract, no cancel.  I mean, I don't know your contract.  It doesn't matter.  Joe, suck that.  I guarantee you don't have a year anniversary in Philly.  How's that?  Joe, this show will be on.  You want to take that bet?  We took the bet in New York. 
[00:24:30]  We'll take the one in Philly, too.  We'll take a year anniversary in Philly.  You want to take the bet?  We took the bet in Boston.  We'll take the bet there.  Take it in Philly.  What do you want to bet?  Whatever you want, Joe.  That means you're going to have to listen every day to make sure we're on the air still.  I'll listen one year from now.  I'll bet you a thousand bucks.  No problem.  A thousand bucks.  Yep.  You're on.  You won't pay up.  No, I will.  No, you won't.  Will you?  Yeah, I'll pay up.  I'll pay up.  Give me your address on the air.  I'm not a jackass, for God's sake.  Give me your phone number.  Give me your address.  Take me off the air.  Put your producer back on.  Put me back on hold with that good music, and I'll give your producer the number. 
[00:25:00]  There is no music on hold.  There was.  You're just playing the Stone Temple Pilots.  That was for 20 seconds.  That's how we got back to the show.  That's not part of the thing I ever heard.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Give your name and your address, and I will be collecting the thousand bucks from you.  Put me back.  Put me back with your...  Remember the bets?  When we were here in New York, when we first started.  Never collected on all the bets from the New York listeners when we first got here. 
[00:25:30]  It's like the AIDS.  He's in denial right now.  After a while, you accept it.  Guy has no clue.  Deal with it.  Guy has no clue what we're going to end up doing to Philadelphia Radio.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, Joe.  You like the music on hold?  Here it is.  La, la, la, la, la.  Jackass.  Hey, Joe.  Hmm?  How long are you going to stay on hold, you tool?  Pardon?  Do you think someone actually is going to pick you up, you loser?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:26:00]  Let's see.  Give me three minutes off the clock.  Let's go to Randy.  Randy, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Doing well.  Listen, I happen to have a unique perspective because I'm a transplanted Philly boy in New  York.  But listening to you guys, and like most people in the beginning, couldn't stand you.  Now I think you guys are like the funniest thing on radio.  Frankly, I think that you're going to go into Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and you're going  to be like the Ebola virus.  You're going to infect a few people. 
[00:26:30]  And those people are going to infect some more people.  Pretty soon, you're going to have the entire city bleeding out of its eyeballs with laughter.  There you go.  Thank you, Randy.  I'm convinced.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Take care, guys.  We've seen this all before.  Seen it all before.  And Joe, still on hold.  Yeah, we'll get right to you, Joe, you idiot.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I just have some news for you.  Actually, I heard on some show that Kelly Ripa must be a big fan because she named her 
[00:27:00]  kid Lola.  Yeah, Kelly Ripa had the kid and named it Lola.  Lola, of course, was the girl we had in here a couple days ago that was tar and feathered,  Anthony.  Yeah, I don't think that had anything to do with it.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah, it did.  We definitely need to tar and feather with honey, Lola, and her kid.  All right.  Why would you name your kid Lola?  That's a little weird.  You're just setting her up to be spinning down a pole naked.  You know?  It's a stripper name.  I'm Lola.  How much more time does she have off? 
[00:27:30]  She's going to take off like a month.  A month?  Yeah.  And what have they got?  Those lovely college students filling in with Regis.  No, he had his wife today.  Oh!  That's got to be hell for him.  He had to go from the hot college co-eds to his wife today.  Gelman, you couldn't keep the young college girls coming in here, and now I'm with my wife  every night.  I don't want to sit next to the bitch during my show.  The poor lady, her skin is, her skin is basically falling off her body.  Oh, don't remind me. 
[00:28:00]  You should see what that's like naked.  It's horrible, Gelman.  Skin hanging like doilies off of a tablecloth.  Horrible.  Lola.  How the hell would you call your kid Lola?  I don't want to...  Turn that down, bitch.  Sam.  Turn that down.  Sam.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sam, turn down your radio.  You're live.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, man?  And I got a call from...  I'm telling you guys in A-hole, man.  Don't listen to it.  What?  Uh, what? 
[00:28:30]  Uh, yeah, I'm...  I don't listen to that guy.  Yeah.  Uh, you stay on the air, uh, and you take Philadelphia.  Forget about it, man.  Forget about that.  Oh, my God.  This is our lucky day.  We've been looking for a stutterer for our show.  So we can complete the whole thing.  Yes.  The whole rip-off thing.  Stuttering Sam.  That's messed up, though.  That's messed up, though, man.  Rob, we're going to make you a huge part of our show.  Right.  We need a stutterer to complete the whole picture.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:29:00]  I was starting to have that already.  I was starting to have that.  I know, but we want to be just like him.  Right.  Come on down.  Oh, no, I mean, don't be like him.  That guy's corny, man.  He's corny.  No, we need to be just like Howard, and we need a stutterer to complete this whole mess.  You'll be interviewing celebrities and everything.  Get your ass down here.  I'm in Jersey right now.  I'm in Jersey.  Is your stutter at least real?  Uh, yeah.  All right, cool.  We got stuttering Sam, Anthony.  That's what we needed.  I'm in Jersey. 
[00:29:30]  I'm in an ice cream truck.  That's why.  We're putting the word out now for a dwarf.  A dwarf?  Preferably a drunk one.  Yeah, we need a drunk dwarf.  I'll get you a dwarf.  We need a drunk dwarf, and to complete it, we need an angry black woman.  Oh, I'll get you a girl in the black.  Because, you know, we can't quite rip the show off completely.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  Later.  All right, bye.  Stuttering Sam, everyone.  Yes.  Stuttering Sam. 
[00:30:00]  Man.  Unbelievable.  Feeling the love.  Yeah, we should continue with these calls.  Why not?  Barry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, it's amazing how many people that call up and say that they don't like your show.  I'm a limo driver, and I used to take every JFK job I could just to listen to you guys.  Don't we need a limo driver, too?  Yeah, from Philly.  No, we need a limo driver.  Barry, please.  Barry, the limo driver.  Barry, the limo driver.  There you go.  You're hired, man. 
[00:30:30]  Stuttering Sam, and we got Barry, the limo driver.  There you go.  You guys are complete.  We're getting there.  Hey, but every single person I put in the limo and turn you guys on here in Philly, they're hooked.  I don't know all these people that say that they don't know.  You know what?  It's still too early for Philly.  It's too early for Chicago.  Where's Jimmy the Joke Man today?  The only people that truly love us is our New York audience.  We understand that, and eventually we'll pick up some cities that are digging the show as well.  Every time I, you know, the first time I was just up in New York, I just moved here a year and a half ago.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was flipping to the radio stations, and I heard you, what was that, the guy with the puppet? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, Otto and George.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was hooked from that point forward.  Right on, Barry.  Thanks.  Hey, but yesterday's show, the best one I've ever heard, guys.  Ah.  The Tyson.  Yeah, the Tyson Rock.  And how many voices can you do?  Oh, I don't know.  You know.  And can do hundreds.  I don't know.  I don't even know.  That's great.  Hey.  All right, Barry.  I'll keep calling back with some more info, okay?  Thank you.  Barry, the limo driver, everyone.  All right, stuttering, Sam, and we got Barry, the limo driver. 
[00:31:30]  We're getting our show really together now.  Yeah, we've been doing radio all wrong for the last seven years, Anthony.  Apparently, though, the people that call up, some of the angry people, say that we're ripoffs.  So, I mean, if we're going to get the label, we might as well go all out.  Might as well.  Might as well.  By the way, Joe's still on hold, Anthony.  He's still on hold.  Let's go to Angelo.  Angelo, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  This guy, Joe, he's a schmuck.  He's insecure.  He's got to call up, you know, tell him, you guys suck.  You should worry about himself. 
[00:32:00]  But he listens to that Y100 down there.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something about Y100.  I got some friends down in Philly, and that station's like RZ100 sucks.  Hey, sorry, guys.  Hey, watch that S-word.  You don't like Y100.  No, no, it definitely sucks.  You guys suck.  All right, I love you guys.  See you later.  Thank you.  Anthony, John, the disgruntled dwarf on line 11.  John.  Yo, fella, how are you?  What's up, John?  Yo, I was hoping that you could play me a request and get the lead out for me. 
[00:32:30]  No, I think we could get a more entertaining drunk dwarf.  Right.  No, you guys suck.  Later.  All right, bye.  We'll take auditions today, though, to complete the show.  Yeah.  We might as well.  You want to keep stuttering Sam?  Yeah, stuttering Sam was good.  All right, very good.  And the limo driver.  Well, we might need a limo driver in New York, though.  Yeah, that's true.  Barry, the limo driver from Philly, that's a little rough. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  So we still need a limo driver, and we still need a disgruntled dwarf.  All right.  I think we have a hairstylist on the line.  Oh, really?  Let's go to Ralph.  Hey, Ralph, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  I wanted to ask if you needed a personal stylist.  Sure.  Yeah.  I could shave your belly and pick out your clothes for the day.  That'd work.  I mean, if we're going to go the rip-off route, we might as well.  Yeah, could you change your name so it doesn't look like we're ripping off any of the shows? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, because you've got to do it in a way where it really doesn't look like it.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Well, I'm not Kay.  Oh, you can't say that.  What?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Jackie on line four.  Jackie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, I'm wondering if you could use an out-of-work joke man for your show.  I'll just sit here and gackle at everything.  I already work for a kike. 
[00:34:00]  They can work for a wop like Anthony.  All right.  I think he might be in.  Yeah.  And you really...  Sit around and I'll mess up your contract negotiations and run off every three months.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Well, I think you're hired, Jackie.  Yeah.  All right.  I need to work now because my bitch wife of mine isn't doing anything.  She's wearing a t-shirt in the basement like the way Trish is. 
[00:34:30]  And maybe if you could get a big, fat, big, breasted breast woman to come over, too.  I'm going to get over and I could sit in the room for her breast.  All right.  Boy, he'll fit right in for a real rip-off show.  I'll give you guys a call later.  You know, if we're going to rip off some of them, we might as well go the distance.  You're going to get accused of it.  You know, and I didn't really think we were.  I just thought we were on the air talking, having fun, but apparently people think we're 
[00:35:00]  being rip-off.  So we'll just go the distance.  Can we...  There's nothing wrong with ripping it off.  I do it for my whole act.  Can we just ask the real Jackie?  We see him.  We see him at the sushi place once a week.  And he loves WISP.  He wears the Howard Stern YSP t-shirt all the time.  Hey, syndication when you guys have finally got your own show.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  It's coming together, Anthony.  Hey, I'm warning you. 
[00:35:30]  After seven years, we might as well just go the distance and complete our show, right?  Oh, yeah.  You want to talk to Low Pitch Ricky?  Hi, this is Low Pitch Ricky.  You want me to blow up his building?  Don't you know, you're definitely ripping off Howard.  He invented dick jokes.  Right.  You know, I've been ripping them off for years because I didn't know that he had invented  been a dick jokes.  I've been telling him, too.  Hey, Low Pitch Ricky?  Yeah.  Your voice isn't that low pitch.  It's not low enough. 
[00:36:00]  How low do you want me to go?  It's got to be really low.  This is as low as I can go.  All right.  Oh, well.  F him.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll pass on Low Pitch Ricky, Anthony?  Yeah, we'll pass on him.  All right.  See, not good enough.  We're going to keep stuttering Sam, though, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  And Rick, the producer.  I don't know.  His teeth aren't that bad.  We want to go that route.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's up?  This is not Jason. 
[00:36:30]  This is Gene Simmons from Kiss.  And I just want to let you know that I invented everything.  You guys are really copying me, Gene Simmons from Kiss.  Hey, Gene, I hear you're selling coffins.  Yes, I'm selling the Kiss coffin.  I will be appearing at the Jacob Javits Center along with everybody else from Kiss.  I'll be making all the money because I created everything.  Yeah.  Thank you, Gene.  It doesn't do that good, Gene.  I'm sorry.  You need a better Gene.  Hey, you guys talk.  Bye.  All right.  Gene Simmons is selling Kiss coffins now.  I know.  I read that one. 
[00:37:00]  That guy is the biggest hoo-ah.  He is a hoo-ah.  Doesn't he have enough money?  Yeah.  He doesn't have any pride, man.  This is, you know, a rock band.  I mean, the people that follow Kiss around are a little different than your normal rock  band fans, and they're willing to buy anything that the band puts out.  And it's all Gene Simmons.  I mean, you know, the other guys in the band, well, Paul is involved, too.  Right?  He makes some money off of the band.  Yeah.  It's Gene and Paul.  But the other guys were just hired employees. 
[00:37:30]  Like, you just grab somebody, slap the makeup on their face.  Like, hired employees.  And they have everything.  Kiss credit cards.  Pinball machines.  The action figures.  The pinball machines.  And Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley get all the money from it.  And it just never ends.  Now coffins.  Kiss coffins.  And they don't understand why they're not really selling that well so far.  You could be buried in it or just use it as a cooler, they suggest.  At parties.  A Kiss coffin.  I don't know.  I guess the guy's doing all right, making money. 
[00:38:00]  We had him in here one day.  And we wanted to talk about, you know, the old days of Kiss being on the road or something.  And all he was doing was hawking various things for him to make money off of.  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  But, hey, they got the fans that'll buy it.  Kiss coffin.  $3,900.  You got someone in your family that would probably buy the Kiss coffin.  My brother-in-law, Johnny Race, is just, I mean, anything Kiss.  He buys it all, right?  He scoops it up.  All the action figures and everything.  Will he buy the Kiss coffin? 
[00:38:30]  The Kiss coffin?  I don't know.  It doubles as a beer cooler.  It's a little steep.  Signed by Kiss.  $3,900.  Get it at kissonline.com.  What else is there?  There's probably all kinds of great.  The Kiss Forever coffin is the latest offering from a merchandising empire that Simmons values at north of $500 million.  The band's imprint appears on products ranging from wine and bubblegum to mobile phones. 
[00:39:00]  How we doing, everybody?  I'm checking out kissonline.com.  I'm sure it's just a smorgasbord of whored-out merchandise.  By the way, Joe's still on hold, Anthony.  Buy it.  Here we go.  Joe's still on hold, Anthony.  Enter the official Kiss store.  I knew this would be on here.  He's got one of those things, add to my shopping cart. 
[00:39:30]  Eddie.  You know?  Eddie Trunk in the studio.  Eddie Trunk knows just about everything about Kiss.  Eddie, don't even mess with us because I know you're a huge Kiss fan, but you even have to realize this is ridiculous.  The Kiss coffin?  It is the most embarrassing, absurd thing I've ever seen in my life.  Thank you.  And you know what?  I am a huge Kiss fan, and the fact of the matter is is that these guys wonder why they don't get the respect from radio and the press that they really want after selling however many millions of records.  But do tactics like this, and it's ridiculous. 
[00:40:00]  There you go.  And you know what?  You guys are talking about how this empire keeps going and all this stuff that's coming out because they just heard about Kiss Cola, Kiss Clothing Line, all this stuff they're doing.  Gene wants to invent a religion, the Kiss religion.  I'll swear to God.  We could call it Kiss-the-anity.  Dude, Gene would sell you the lint out of his pockets if he could.  It's so sad.  You've got to think he's a multi-millionaire.  One of the things that I just heard recently that happened, which is kind of interesting, and why all this stuff might be coming out, is Paul Stanley just got pretty hammered in a divorce. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, really?  Yep.  Lost a house and millions of dollars.  There was no prenup involved.  I know the feeling.  And maybe, just maybe, the Kiss Farewell Tour isn't ever going to end, at least for another few years, because they've got to try to recoup some of that money.  Oh, man.  This is just an embarrassment today.  Real life final tap.  And it doubles as a beer cooler.  And there's a picture in the paper today with Gene next to the coffin looking all happy. 
[00:41:00]  Look at him.  He's all like, look at me next to the Kiss coffin.  Is he selling that Kiss wig on his head?  Is that a part of the merchandise?  I wouldn't doubt it.  Get the Gene Simmons Kiss wig, because that ain't his hair.  Eddie, I'm kind of surprised.  I thought you were going to stick up and fight for Kiss, but I'm so happy you have seen the light, that this is just getting out of hand, the Kiss merchandise.  You know what?  Oh, it's really funny, because I've been a Kiss fan.  They were my first favorite band as a little kid in the 70s and all. 
[00:41:30]  And I never, ever bought the merchandise.  I only just bought the records and went to the shows.  And it's so funny, because I have videotaping interviews from them in the late 70s, talking about how all this merchandise ruined them.  And it was their demise, and it'll never happen again.  Because they want to get the money from it?  Well, no, just because it was so ridiculous.  And now, 20 years later, I'd love to put those interviews in their face and say, wait, why is it okay now?  It's just insane.  Well, because now they're pocketing huge amounts of cash.  Yeah.  All right, let's move on here.  Thanks, Eddie. 
[00:42:00]  Lisa, what's up?  Hey, I'll be Robin, guys.  You'll be Robin?  Yeah, I'm the black chick.  Oh, you'll be the black chick?  You've got to be black, though.  Are you black?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And she sounds like a white chick, which works perfectly.  Works out good, doesn't it?  You got big hands?  Um, yeah, actually.  And she laughs at everything she says.  You want to come down so we can check you out?  Um, I can't come today, but...  All right, hold on a line.  Hold on a line, all right?  Yeah, we'll get her. 
[00:42:30]  Uh, Beetle Fruit Punch checking in, Anthony.  Beetle Fruit Punch, what's up?  Uh, hello, guys.  It's Beetle Fruit Punch.  Beetle Fruit Punch.  It's short for Beetle Fruit Punch from Concentrate.  Very good.  I'm sorry, I can barely hear you because I've got a small head and I can't hold the phone  receiver up all the way to the ear, to the phone, to the mouth.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  That's great.  That's pretty good, man. 
[00:43:00]  Beetle Fruit Punch, you call our show from time to time, okay?  Okay, guys.  I'll call you in about five minutes.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  Gene Simmons Bowman from New York saying, Gene Simmons, just like Krusty the Clown.  Um, remember Krusty put his name on everything?  Krusty Monopoly.  Krusty Brand Crowd Control.  It's a Krusty Coffin.  He is.  Uh, Anthony, I gotta interrupt you.  Uh, Crackhead Tony wants to say hi.  Crackhead Tony.  Hey.  Crackhead Tony here.  Well, you don't sound like much of a crackhead. 
[00:43:30]  Let me tell you why.  I'm out of character right now.  I pulled over to talk to you guys because I'm on a cell phone.  Right.  And it's this hot chick vacuuming out her car up on Woodhaven Boulevard right now.  So you don't want to act like a jackass in front of her.  No, I can't do anything.  I'm just looking at this.  It's unbelievable.  Nothing wrong with that.  Where did Ra-Ra Ricky go?  Um, right after this point, too.  Where is he?  No, Ra-Ra Ricky just left the studio, Anthony.  Ra-Ra Ricky.  Looney Cabby wants to say hi.  Hello? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, Looney Cabby.  Hey.  What's up?  Opie.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah.  Can I kiss your ass all day?  I used to be on crack.  Oh?  Wait, I want to make...  You guys have a job at night for me?  Maybe I could be like a standby disc jockey?  Hold on.  I'll make you feel at home.  All right, now talk.  Huh?  He sounds good.  That just made everyone in New York laugh.  Trust me.  I don't have no mics on me or any headsets. 
[00:44:30]  Very good.  Yes, Looney Cabby.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, bye.  Bye.  That's pretty funny.  That's funny.  That's right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Okay, then.  Very good.  All right.  People really know how to fit in.  All right.  Farley, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I was wondering if Opie and Hattie can get me laid by a porn star. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you, Farley.  All right.  All right.  Joe's still on hold, Anthony.  Yeah.  Waiting for us to pick him up.  Because he hates us so much.  Why would he stay on hold that long?  He wants something.  He wants to make a bet.  He's eager.  That we're not going to be around in a year in Philadelphia.  We'll be around.  Don't worry about it.  Don't listen.  All right.  That's all we're trying to say. 
[00:45:30]  As we take a break, we'll go to the O&A archives.  We played a little thing.  Well, we had a competition.  Yeah.  Remember penis weightlifting?  Penis weightlifting.  What, Rick?  Just people that are calling out for reticulous.  Well, Anthony, sorry, but my dad's on the line.  Is he?  Yes, Ben Hughes.  Yes, Dad, what's up? 
[00:46:00]  This is Ben Hughes.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, I told you not to be stupid, you moron.  There you go.  He's not going to dump out of this, is he?  Hello?  No, he shouldn't.  It's all in great fun.  All right, we had a competition where guys came in and lifted stuff with their junk.  Right. 
[00:46:30]  And we have a minute of highlights here.  Be quiet.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  You're going to be accused.  You might as well do it.  Might as well go the distance, right?  All right.  Check this out from the archives.  It's penis weightlifting.  This is Andrew from New Jersey.  Now he's lifting.  He's swinging it.  He's swinging it. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my God.  He's swinging it.  He's swinging the ball.  Put it down.  Put it down.  Oh, my God.  The lady is very impressed by his lifting prowess.  He has taken the anvil that weighs 40 pounds.  He's working feverishly to get that fastened on.  On three.  Here's Andrew for kicks and giggles.  40 pounds.  He's lifting it.  Come on.  Come on.  He's having trouble. 
[00:47:30]  He's up.  40 pounds.  He's swinging it.  He's swinging 40 pounds.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  People here are giving Andrew a standing ovation.  Brush your hands.  Cyndication now.  Opie and Anthony are finally syndicated.  Woo-hoo.  And to celebrate, they're going to be at Mulcahy's in Wanta, Long Island this Thursday with Dr. 
[00:48:00]  Dirty, Mr. John Belby.  The show starts at 9 p.m., so come on down and hang with the guys this Thursday at Mulcahy's  in Wanta, Long Island.  From 102.7 WNEW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  That's right.  Joey Paisano runs the place.  There's an original.  By the way.  Joey Paisano.  By the way, New York, Joe from Philly is still on hold.  Joey Paisano.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, right there in the heart of Little Italy.  It's got all the romance of Italy.  It's a warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant. 
[00:48:30]  And they serve incredible, authentic Italian cuisine.  It's made from old-world Italian recipes.  And priced right.  You can take the whole family there, and you're not going to go broke.  The portions of Paisano's are huge.  And they have the incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  So it's not just for dinner.  We go there a lot.  Anytime I have a family function in the city, take the whole family down there.  It's nice.  And now with the weather, the way it is, nice and warm, they close the street down.  They close down Mulberry.  You sit out front.  It's great.  You watch all the people.

We're not trying to be your enemy.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:49:30]  You can get a hold of us toll free 877-692-1027.  All right?  I hate this.  Somebody sends me a picture.  It says hot picture of Christina Aguilera.  And I click on the link.  And it's Christina Aguilera from the VH1 Awards.  And it says pan down.  And there's like this photoshopped labia just hanging out her short leg.  Oh, what?  That's not real?  No. 
[00:50:00]  It looks like a big...  It looks like a mouth down there.  I hate doctored photos.  Never hot.  We're getting hate calls from Chicago and we're not even on yet in Chicago.  Yes.  This is on tape delay.  Yeah.  All right.  Speaking of not hot, do you see all the hype that everybody was saying that there was going 
[00:50:30]  to be a female money shot on that Sex and the City show?  We pissed off Anthony so bad today in the back office.  First of all, I can't stand Sex and the City.  I don't like the show.  It's a bunch of marginally attractive women just talking about sex and stuff.  Anthony, are you worried that Sarah Jessica Parker is listening to us once again today?  I don't care.  Now you're calling her kind of attractive? 
[00:51:00]  If Ruth Buzzy is listening.  We called her Ruth Buzzy in a dress and she called us because she called up all pissed off.  You know, people listen to these things.  You might not think that people are listening, but we're listening and you're hurting our feelings.  I don't like the show.  I just don't like it.  It's not hot.  But when was this on?  This Sunday?  This was on Sunday.  The female O-shot?  Yeah, the money shot.  Yeah, the money shot.  The money shot where, you know, sometimes girls get themselves worked up into such a frenzy  that when they, at the moment, they feel the most intense pleasure, there's a byproduct 
[00:51:30]  that kind of goes places.  Camel spit.  Yeah, it looks like camel spit.  Camel spit.  So they're hyping this whole thing.  And Rick is just like, oh man, you know, tonight they're going to have this female money shot.  It was cool.  So the one that was on Porky's, what the hell was the name?  Kim Cattrall.  Kim Cattrall. 
[00:52:00]  The one that was the moaner.  The moaner from Porky's, sure.  Hot and Porky's, not hot on this show.  Don't like it.  Mm-mm.  But I guess everyone was talking about the money shot.  So Rick and Ben, you know, go, gosh, you really got to check this out.  You got to watch this.  So now, anytime.  Ben, Ben, Ben, I got to ask Ben.  Ben, did you, and be honest.  What?  Did you think that scene was hot?  No, I mean, I was just, Rick had told me yesterday that there was going to be, but  neither one of us had seen it.  So I saw it last night.  No, I just, I was just surprised more than anything.  No, I, you know. 
[00:52:30]  So first of all, anytime Rick goes to show me, because this happened occasionally, where  something happens on Sex and the City, and Rick goes, oh, you got to check this out.  So he tries to cue it up to the part on the show that he wants us to see.  He, he adds like five minutes of preliminary crap.  He rewinds too far, and I'm having to watch Sex and the City.  And I hate it.  I trick you.  And I'm sitting there going, all right, when's the moment that we're, we're, I'm sitting 
[00:53:00]  here to watch.  All we know is that they start the tape with some lady.  Miranda.  Miranda, eating cake out of her garbage.  He knows all the names.  Eating, eating chocolate cake out of her garbage can or something.  Yeah.  Oh, and she's on the phone.  Ah, you're going to have to get me from the Betty Crocker Clinic.  Oh, I got a joke on the Betty Ford Clinic, and it's cake because it's Betty Crocker.  And I'm just sitting there, and, and out loud, I'm sitting there just going, oh, oh, please.  Ah, hurry.  So finally, the moment comes where, uh, no, what we had to see the other girl, was that 
[00:53:30]  Miranda too?  Miranda laying in bed, pulling out the, uh, the apparatus to take care of herself.  She was substituting chocolate for sex.  Now she needed a substitute for chocolate.  So she pulls this big, goddamn, black, schlong dildo out of her night table.  And usually that's, that's hot.  Usually like, oh, it's porno.  You know, a chick's going to do a little dildo scene.  But the whole office just went, we're like, ugh, ugh, ugh, just, just, ugh.  Awful, as Jim Norton would say.  Awful, awful.  Despicable, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, disgusting, ugh. 
[00:54:00]  So we, and we, we, we go through that because Rick rewinds too far.  Too far.  So then we get to the part.  The female money shot.  All I see is a girl's kneecaps up in the air.  She's laying on the bed.  And the Kim Cattrall girl there is, uh, is, uh, doing her thing with the girl.  You know, kind of pleasuring her.  And all of a sudden, she looks up and...  This projectile of fluid... 
[00:54:30]  Just, uh, I'm shooting out.  Right into Kim Cattrall's face.  Quack!  Quack!  Yeah, exactly.  Quack!  Quack!  Quack!  Camel spit.  Camel spit.  And I'm sitting there going, is, is this supposed to be hot?  I was completely disgusted.  Like, it didn't even look hot when they're...  And then she's like, how was that?  Was that good or bad? 
[00:55:00]  She goes.  Was that a good thing or a bad thing?  And the woman that she's taking care of, laying on the bed...  Well, we didn't see her face at first.  They finally panned up to her face.  They panned up to her, and it's like, oh my God, it's like a woman that works at DMV.  She's laying in bed, and she's like, that was good.  Ugh!  She looked like Dean Wormer's wife from Animal House.  Hold on, man.  Don't even say she was hot.  She was hot.  Stop it.  Hot. 
[00:55:30]  You have...  You have...  Hot.  I think you got some kind of a mother fixation.  You wouldn't have banged her?  No.  She got those big old lady shoes on, and the bad stockings.  And that bra that looked like the torpedo cones.  Difference between me and you, and I'm going to, like, abuse myself, of course.  I would rather do the Dean's wife.  Yeah.  You would have rather done the little...  I'd have done the one where the devil was going on Amadeus' shoulders.  Right. 
[00:56:00]  Isn't that funny?  Went from Animal House to Amadeus.  And, yeah, I would have rather done her.  But in Animal House, not in Caddyshack.  Right.  She had dirty feet in Caddyshack.  That was a turn-off.  No, you don't!  Thanks for nothing!  That's the same chick.  Great accent.  Great.  That's the only part of Caddyshack that sucked.  I can't sit through the part where she's flying through the golf course with that nightgown on.  Caddyshack could have been the perfect comedy if you cut out her scenes. 
[00:56:30]  I'm late.  I'm late.  Late for not being pregnant!  No, you don't!  Ugh!  Shut up!  Danny?  I hate that!  Sit down, Danny.  You're a good kid, Newton.  Pick that up.  Almost a perfect comedy.  Almost.  That one part was just like...  And then she's dancing around in her nightie.  Laughing.  On one of the, you know, one of the greens.  Yeah.  Did she live that close to the golf course that she just jumped out of bed and started dancing around one of the greens? 
[00:57:00]  She was the green keeper's daughter.  You know, the guy...  I'll fill your bagpipes with we tina you.  Yeah, but...  Fuzzy foreigner.  It's time to change the horse!  That guy.  That was his daughter, so I guess they had a little house on the golf course.  Okay, I got you.  She did live on the golf course, but she's skipping...  It's...  Ugh!  You know, I've seen that movie a hundred times.  A thousand times!  And I've never picked up on the fact that it was the green keeper's daughter on such a long time.  I swear to God!  All right, wait. 
[00:57:30]  When did they say that it was the green keeper's daughter?  They don't!  You just assumed she lives on the golf course.  And they have kind of the same accent.  And it's the same accent.  All right, all right.  No, you don't!  No, you don't!  No, you don't!  I'm late for not being pregnant!  Thanks for nothing.  Danny!  Anyway, where were we?  She's been plucked more times than the Rose of Chile.  I'm thorned.  I'm thorned.  I hate her.  I hate her!  Lacey, Lacey Underwood.  Well, Lacey didn't hold up to the test of time.  Oh, you see her recently? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, I got the special edition DVD.  Yeah.  They do the recent interviews.  Oh, thanks for wrecking my fantasy.  Thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  So where were we?  You're talking about Sex and the City.  Oh, yeah, the money shot.  And the money shot.  But then we went off on Caddyshack.  And I don't know how we get back to it.  I know I had a point.  You said that she looked like Dean Wormer.  Dean Wormer's wife, yeah.  Right, right.  Yeah, because she's just, you know, there's two, I don't know, women that, I'm not saying 
[00:58:30]  that women at that age aren't hot and sexy.  It's fine.  But in that circumstance, in that show, they're past their prime.  You know what I mean?  Like Kim Cattrall was hot in Porky's.  Dude, she's still hot, man.  No, she's a very attractive woman.  I'll give her that.  But it's not hot where you want to see her getting splooged in the face like that.  She had a map of Hawaii on her forehead. 
[00:59:00]  A map of Kauai all over her forehead.  And it's just like spitting out at her like a llama.  And no one wants to, I don't know, I'll speak for myself.  I don't want to see that.  It wasn't hot.  And it's being billed as being really hot.  Colin, what's up?  Hey, I was just going to say, Anthony, do you prefer the gay scenes from Sixth Street?  Six Feet Under?  Oh, yes.  What?  What's Six Feet Under?  I mean, you know, those are pretty hot, huh?  Colin, did you watch Sex and the City and you watched that scene? 
[00:59:30]  I just watched it the first time last night and I laughed my ass off.  All right.  It's kind of funny, sure.  But it's not hot.  It's, well, no.  The camel spitting, I like.  All right.  That's a good point.  But it wasn't that grotesque.  I mean, you know, I don't know.  All right.  I agree that when you pan back to the woman, she does kind of look like the mummy's wife.  You know, up until that, you've got Kim Cattrall between these nice legs. 
[01:00:00]  Well, that looked like it had potential.  I thought they were going to pan up and the girl was going to be, you know, young.  True.  All right.  You guys rock on.  Welcome aboard Philadelphia.  Peace out.  Hey, thanks.  Thank you.  Hey, we just got a normal call from Philly that kind of contributed to our radio show.  Wasn't that nice, Anthony?  Yes.  Usually we go to the Philly calls and they tell us how much we suck.  I'm going to, I'm with Babs in this one, Anthony.  What?  Babs says you're wrong about the groundskeeper's daughter.  Babs.  Yes.  Go ahead. 
[01:00:30]  She wasn't the groundskeeper's daughter.  She was one of the workers.  Remember, she was one of the chicks who just worked in the kitchen?  Yeah, but I think she worked there, but she was the groundskeeper's daughter.  That's why she lived in the house with all the other chicks.  Hold on.  It was like an Irish warhouse.  I'll get to the bottom of this right away.  Maggie O'Hooligan.  I think you're right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll give you that text and the city does stuff.  I'll give you that.  Her name was Maggie O'Hooligan.  And the head groundskeeper was Sandy McFittish. 
[01:01:00]  God damn it.  Why did she have to have that bad accent for the movie?  Now, look at me.  After this many years, I just assumed that that was the daughter, and that's why she was gone.  Well, then why the hell was she dancing on the goddamn golf course in her 90s?  Let's not be a prank.  Thanks for doing it.  That's good, Albert.  And then when he won the caddy tournament, winning the caddy tournament, 
[01:01:30]  and he took her back to, Noonan took her back to the little room,  and what's his name?  Denunzio.  Denunzio was looking in the window, and they start getting down.  I was disgusted when she's laying there in those big, dopey, late 70s, early 80s panties.  Well, they had to cover up the 70s earth, mama, mama.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sure that looked like a world of hurt.  You've got to trim that green, honey.  And her feet were disgustingly black and dirty. 
[01:02:00]  And I don't like that.  I'm sorry.  I like clean, I like clean-showered girls.  I can't believe you noticed your feet, dude.  I saw the movie a thousand times.  I knew it was on the walls.  Albert, what was on the walls in that room?  Not much.  Okay, good.  No pictures, curtains that they pulled closed.  Albert?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, I was watching that Sex in the City thing.  I hate that show, too.  That little squirt looked like somebody just pinched that little ball inside of Jessica's face.  That's what it looked like.  It was terrible, man.  It got me all excited. 
[01:02:30]  I was over there, you know, getting ready to put the lotion on and apply myself.  I couldn't even do it.  Looked like someone was popping a zit.  Exactly.  Popping a zit.  You see how big.  Have you seen it in person?  Huh?  Have you seen that little motion got on her face in person?  Which one?  Sarah Jessica's mole.  Sarah Jessica's mole.  Sarah Jessica's mole.  No, she invited us down to the set, but she backed out.  Cameron Trill's got the mole on her face.  Jackass?  All right.  I want you to kill all the gophers.  Check me on this one, Sandy, but if I kill all the gophers, they'll put me away from you.  No gophers, you get... 
[01:03:00]  You have to do some 10-9.  I love that.  Before we end this break, you got to do the 10-9.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat, but the  man that's worthwhile is the man that could smile when his shorts are too tight in the  seat.  Okay, Pookie, christen the boat.  Isn't the groundskeeper of Scottish origin and Maggie Irish? 
[01:03:30]  Maybe.  Who knew?  She did a horrible accent regardless of what it was.  I just assumed they were father and daughter or something.  Smolden, get your foot off the boat.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What?  Anthony, you better not be watching Oz this coming season.  They're going to solve that with money shots on HBO.  What?  Oh, I don't want to see those money shots.  You know something?  Oz, if you get past the man-ass on that show, which is every episode, schlong, it's horrible. 
[01:04:00]  But the show itself, very entertaining.  You just got to sit there and get ready and go, oh, God damn.  Hey, hey, guys, guys.  Is Joe still on hold?  Let me see.  Where is that?  There he is, right there, still on hold.  I think he's in third, moving in on the Hello Lady at number two and Gary Coleman at number  one.  I believe you're right.  See, we suck that bad, but, you know, he cannot hang up for some reason.  Thank you, Frank.  No problem.  All right.  Let me go to Scott.  Scott, what's up? 
[01:04:30]  What's going on?  Hey, man.  That redhead in Sex and the City.  Yeah.  She's a pig.  She ruins the show.  The other ones are all right.  The brunette, she's pretty good looking.  You know, Kim Cattrall I can deal with.  Right.  And I look at that redhead, man.  She is disgusting.  Can't we just have The Sopranos on all year long?  Yeah, I hate that.  The Sopranos goes off, and you got to wait and wait, and they put Sex and the City on,  and, like, they're throwing us a bone.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Take care.  Bye.  Yes, we know, Caddyshack 2, worst movie ever made. 
[01:05:00]  Ugh.  No, Ghost Dad was worse.  No, Caddyshack 2 was the worst comedy ever.  Yeah.  Al Snow from the WWF is waiting to come in.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  We have lots to do today, as I look here.  Okay.  Anthony, we got more tickets to go see Babe Fest this Thursday night at the Electric Factory  in Philadelphia.  Mm-hmm.  Kid Rock is hosting, Slash's Snake Pit is performing.  We're going to have Kid Rock and Snake Pit on our show in the very near future. 
[01:05:30]  Are you doing anything that night?  Good.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  If you want to go to Babe Fest, give us a call right now, 877-692-1027.  So, Stephen Lynch is here, and you got a song for Julie, the transvestite pre-sex-op mess.  Mess.  Yeah, I dated somebody like that one.  Okay.  And hermaphrodite is the technical lingo.  Hermaphrodite. 
[01:06:00]  Well, I had a personal experience with one.  You did?  Yeah, I wrote a little song about it.  Okay.  She's part girl, she's part boy.  She's got parts everyone can enjoy.  She's got more, she's got less.  She's got her manhood tucked in her dress.  Is she a mister or is she a miss? 
[01:06:30]  My little girl, she's my little guy.  When I try to please her, when I try to please her, I get poked in the eye.  Yeah.  She wears lace and she wears flannel.  She watches football and the Lifetime channel. 
[01:07:00]  What's that bulge under her nightie?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Some things are white, some things are black.  Some girls wear makeup, mine shaves her back.  She is still beautiful, she is still fine.  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  She looks like Cher, but she's built like Sonny.  She loves Brad Pitt and finds the Three Stooges funny.  Who's that girl with the grip so mighty?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite. 
[01:08:00]  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Woo!  Yeah!  You've got to be kidding me.  That was great.  Steve and Lynch, everyone.  You know, you don't write that.  Syndication now.

Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, hey, who's the one that likes the older chick, is it, Ant? 
[01:10:00]  What?  Who likes the oldest Jewish girls?  Is that Anthony?  The older Jewish girls?  Yeah, like, all right, first to go back to Caddyshack.  You said the worst scene, like the little Irish, the nanny, you know, when he knocks her up and she goes,  Oh, gee, you know, remember that scene?  Right.  That was the worst scene.  To me, when the chick comes out of the shower and she's like,  Man, it's all in the night.  Remember that scene?  Doesn't that stick in your head when she goes, Danny, it's all in the night game.  Oh, the little kid runs out of the bathroom at the beginning.  Oh, yeah, I was like, what the hell? 
[01:10:30]  I mean, I couldn't get that out of my head.  Danny, it's all in the night game.  Yeah, no, no, second of all.  Noonan's sister, though, was hot.  The older one that turned around and goes, hey, that training bra came in for you.  And she turns around and her shirt flies open.  She's in her panties.  Nice.  Yeah, I like that.  Nice.  Now, what did the old lady say?  When she come out of the shower after he's hiding in the bathroom because he's, like, banging the,  I'm sorry, he's hitting the old, he's hitting the niece in the master bedroom.  He comes in with the 7-iron, starts swinging it around.  Yeah.  What did she tell him in the bathroom?  She goes, Lufa, can you loosen my, what did she say? 
[01:11:00]  Lufa.  Lufa, my stretcher.  What is this, Lufa?  Now, looky here, Lufa.  Lufa.  Lufa.  Lufa.  You ever see a Lufa thing?  A Lufa.  No.  The women use it in the shower to try to get rid of the cellulite.  They got it at a bath and body.  Hey, shut up.  They got it at Bath and Body Works.  You go over there to the mall, they got them.  Bath and Body Works.  They're all sorts of colors.  I'm sure if you're checking your mom's bathroom, she's got one.  Yeah, she's got one.  How long does it take you to dial a phone?  This guy just sounds like he's, every second of the day, he's got to use maximum brain  power to breathe.  Doesn't it sound like that? 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  I think your gene pool needs a little chlorine, but.  The skin has got to be clean.  Jeff, you have to slow down if you call us again, all right?  I'm sorry.  Remember that time in the movie, it was a genius.  He just picks up his brain and goes, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Like the frigging check valves, there's steam coming out.  Anthony, two friends of the show in the studio, Al Snow and of course Taz from the WWF.  Always a pleasure, guys.  What's up, guys?  Having fun?  Pulling out Billy Beru.  The old Billy Beru.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Taz, unzip my pants and pull out Billy Beru. 
[01:12:00]  Hey, judge, a thousand bucks, you missed that putt.  Spalding.  Favorite of yours, too, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yes.  Wasted you.  I was watching some of the WWF last night.  Saw Taz beating up on Hardcore Holly.  Yes.  That was victorious.  That was nice.  Back in the ring.  I like that.  Yeah.  What do you mean back in the ring?  Pretty good.  I haven't been in the ring a lot.  No, you took a little time off.  I took a little vacation.  I know.  I think Anthony's stiffing you a little bit.  Yeah, I think he is.  Come on, you kicked his ass. 
[01:12:30]  I like that.  Well, not exactly.  He kind of beat my ass and I just won.  You won.  Yeah.  It never really depends on who really gets beat up, does it?  Well, you win.  That's all I mean.  I'm starting to think those might be predetermined.  No.  I told you last time they're not.  You stop.  You won't believe me, Al.  I understand.  He doesn't understand it.  No.  You know what?  We have to play the audio of Taz scaring the ass out of Ben from the last time Taz was  in here.  Last time Taz was in, it was a couple of weeks ago or a month ago or something like that.  It was on a Friday.  Ben was really hungover.  Ben was drunk hungover.  No, Ben was still drunk.  And obnoxious.  Really bad. 
[01:13:00]  I'm sure he was really bad.  Hold on.  We got the audio.  You got to set it up, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  He was really hungover or something.  Was it the company party the night before?  No.  Where were we?  Where were you that you were so hammered?  We had the, I think it was the Hard Rock, the night we did that thing at the Hard Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Shots abounded that night.  Yeah.  So then Taz comes in.  And for some reason, Taz was picking on Ben, a little for being drunk and smelling like  a brewery.  And then Ben figured after Taz was out of the studio and the door was locked, that he's going  to get brave and start mouthing off to Taz.  So Rick unlocks the door. 
[01:13:30]  But Ben didn't see that.  Ben didn't know.  So Ben's on the mic going, yeah, guy, big son of a bitch.  Taz was on the phone.  Taz was on the phone, yeah, and he's ragging him over the phone.  Taz comes flying through the door.  Ben turned whiter than he was.  He was a pasty white anyway from being hungover.  He turned like gray.  And just the look on his face of fear was so offensive.  You see Taz rushing you, man.  I was scared.  That scared the living crap out of me.  He came through the door about 100 miles an hour and got right in your face. 
[01:14:00]  He was like, you got something to say now?  He was an inch from your face.  But I'd like to say he looks like a different man.  I'm just saying during a break, he looks tremendous.  He's a good looking kid.  Oh, wait till later on.  He'll be drunk again.  He'll be calling you on your cell phone.  Hey, Taz, I left you.  He'll be on the sauce in about two hours.  Yeah, he's the guy.  You have the friends that get drunk and just decide to pull out their cell phone and call  anyone at all hours.  Hey, hey, man. 
[01:14:30]  I'm out partying, man.  You come out, man.  Hook up.  We'll go to this bar.  You look, you're like, it's five in the morning, you jackass.  And Ben's latest movie's been going to the U2 shows all over the place.  Boston, New York.  I'm getting calls from the middle of the U2 concert.  Oh, that's great.  He's trying to give me a piece of the concert.  You can't even hear it.  No, no, no.  What? 
[01:15:00]  He must have called me at least six or seven times from the U2 shows.  Yeah.  Those are the calls you get.  The best is when Ben goes to a Red Sox-Yankees game at Fenway Park.  Then he calls up all drunk during the day.  Taz is the most annoying guy when he had booze plus cell phone equals a-hole.  So you want to hear the audio? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Pay attention to the first few seconds.  You'll hear somebody say something pretty funny, Taz.  He goes, Taz.  I could kick the crap out of that guy.  See, I started talking.  Come on, man.  Wait, back that up.  Back that up.  I was saying I could kick the crap out of Ben.  I want to make sure Taz heard that, okay?  Could you turn it up a little, please?  This was right after we were done with Taz and he was leaving the studio.  See, there's humor in the fact that it's so ridiculous, me even saying that, that it becomes funny. 
[01:16:00]  Here he goes.  Taz.  I could kick the crap out of Ben.  It's not even like a blurry sentence.  It's like blatant.  Like you could hear the door just shut.  I did not say that.  I'm just going to deny, deny, deny.  Thanks, Rick, you ass.  It's funny.  You get me killed.  All right, let's play the whole thing through.  As Taz comes through the door and scares the crap back.  Can we start it all the way from the beginning?  Yeah.  Thanks, Al.  Jesus. 
[01:16:30]  We can just play Taz's last visit and you guys don't even have to be here.  Yeah, really?  Can we just play Fright from the beginning when Anthony basically nailed his coffin shut?  Here we go, one more time.  Oh, McFoley's on the line.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  He goes, Taz.  I could kick the crap out of that guy.  What are you, insane?  Lock the door.  Come on.  All right.  We're in the middle of commercials, I guess.  Oh, that's right.  We had just done a live event really locking the door. 
[01:17:00]  Loser.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he called.  He's banging.  Ah-ha.  It's locked.  It's locked.  Ha-ha, Taz, you're a pussy.  Dude, how you doing?  Taz.  Hey, Taz, you're a pussy.  Taz is trying to get back in.  Hey, Taz, look through the window.  Oh, he gave Ben the finger.  Ooh.  Hey, Taz, it was him.  I don't want any part of this, man.  Shut up. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, no.  He's on my back.  He will run through that door.  No, we like that.  I'm kidding.  I know.  It's all in good fun.  Taz is a great guy.  We love Taz.  You see how pissed he looked outside the window?  Taz.  Taz.  I think Taz is on the phone.  Taz.  He hung up.  Can't even use a phone.  Outside.  All right, Taz.  A prison visit.  Oh, Jesus.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  They're saying that Taz is trying to call the, uh... 
[01:18:00]  Is he?  Let me see if this works.  Taz?  All right.  Hey.  What's the matter, Taz?  Anthony, you weren't surprised.  No, you're my pal.  Hey.  Look, I know how old he is.  Wait, wait.  I didn't do nothing.  I know that.  And the other little nitsy, little stupid, little silly bastard that's in there.  Uh-oh.  I don't even know his deal, but, uh, Anthony, I'm surprised.  Ooh.  I'm surprised that you went.  Taz, you know, I was just kidding.  There's a jump in the ring.  Oh, Ben, you've been locked out.  It's all in good humor.  It's all in good humor.  Look, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  All right, Taz.  All right, Taz.  But anyway, uh, I'll see you guys real soon. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  All right, Taz.  Bye.  Ben, be nice to Taz.  Faggot.  I'm kidding.  I'm trying to get in.  This is great.  Hey, Dick.  All right, he got in.  I will say right away when he came in.  He got in.  Did you see Ben speak out?  No way am I screwing this.  Ben, if you shouldn't speak like you do with liquor.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Did you see Ben speak out? 
[01:19:00]  I was like, yeah, yeah.  He got in.  Oh, my God.  They got the key.  He opened the door and flew in right up to Ben.  Ben's face.  He freaked out like he was going to be killed.  I ain't screwing with that guy.  It was like you saw a ghost, man.  I don't talk the most crap, but when that door opened, I was like, oh, God.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  Die, Ben.  You're going to die.  He was in the middle of saying something.  God damn, is that funny.  He was in the middle of abusing him again.  The door goes first and open. 
[01:19:30]  He doesn't look drunk anymore, does he?  He was in Ben's face.  He just sobered up real quick.  All right.  There you go.  Boy, I sold myself out more than anything.  I was going to say, I didn't hear Ben say, but maybe two words.  You just buried the hell out of Taz.  Taz, you know.  Come on.  What's the deal here?  You know it was fun, right?  No, it wasn't fun.  It was fun while the door was locked.  Yes.  You know you might have.  I thought we were.  Taz was fun at my expense.  Brooklyn, man.  Brooklyn. 
[01:20:00]  I know Brooklyn, yeah.  Brooklyn.  Frig Brooklyn, you dissed me.  Yeah.  Come on, boys in Brooklyn.  We hang, we talk, we goof with each other, right?  Are you from like Roosevelt or something?  Where are you from?  Oh, that's the other guy.  Originally from Huntington, Long Island.  But I'm Brooklyn now.  He didn't get it.  He didn't get it.  We're right over his head.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Now, that's right, Taz.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hey, Mick Foley wants to say hi.  Oh, God.  Hey, Mick.  Mick.  What's up, Mick?  Hey, am I on the air?  Yeah, we got Al Snow in the studio and Taz.  Hey, that's why I'm calling. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, I figured.  Hey, you know, Al, the WWF specifically called me and said we have Al in there.  Ruin his day.  And I'm not going to do that.  The only way it could be any worse is if I could actually see you.  Hey, he says you're obsessed with us.  No, that's not true.  I want, Al, were you watching Heat?  No.  Okay.  I was there for Heat, Mick.  Taz, what did I say about Al?  Well, what did you say about the ratings?  No, but what you said about Al was...  Oh, Al.  Well, Al, he actually put you over, Al.  He said that on Tough Enough, you did a tremendous job and stuff like that. 
[01:21:00]  And I agreed with...  And he did.  He put you over.  Were you sick?  No.  No, I knew we were on Heat and very few people would be witnesses.  But now I'm on O&A.  And so I'm going to say the same thing that Al...  And people are going to know I mean this because I haven't said anything nice about Al in the last four or five years.  Al is supposed to be outstanding in this.  And Kevin Dunn, one of our producers, said this is going to make Al a star.  And I was so damn happy, Anthony and I'll be out.  I have a... 
[01:21:30]  The rest of my...  My future as a writer...  Put a quarter in there.  You want to pay phone, man?  I don't know what the hell that is.  You're on the Times bestseller list, man.  I don't know what's going on here.  You can afford a quarter.  I haven't paid my bill.  I don't know what it is.  I've got Al as a subject of a couple children's stories I wrote.  And, you know, nobody was happier than I was when I heard that Al signed a contract extension.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, I was like, this is... 
[01:22:00]  Al, admit, this is a pretty good children's story with you in it, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's very good.  It's a great story.  Yeah, thank you.  Things were a little tough, but Al is definitely the best defined character in there.  And it would have been like, I already paid...  Even though I'm an emotional retard.  Of course.  Every other moment, I'm in tears.  Pulling apart.  Yeah.  What was it?  Oh, yeah.  The other kids are out running Al, and then it says...  And, of course, Mick goes and carries me on his back like he has for years.  So that I can catch up with the other kids. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, I think it says...  Mick looked back and was real sad, for the two of them were pals.  And as he had done for many years, Mick picked up and carried Al.  Mick's mighty heart was pounding beneath his flannel shirt or something about his legs hurt, but he made it to the end.  Al jumped down and gave Mick a hug and said...  What'd he say, Al?  I don't want to say it.  Say it.  What'd he say? 
[01:23:00]  What'd he say, Al?  You're my bestest friend.  Ah, there you go.  I told Opie and Anthony we're like the human equivalent of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  Ah, but you know what?  I keep getting shot, though.  You know what I found out about myself?  Dr. Rabbit, he brought us here.  You know, if you're a pitcher and you throw like a 98-mile-an-hour fastball, and you're bringing that heat, but you know the guy at the plate has a good swing and once in a while he's going to send a screaming liner back to the box? 
[01:23:30]  That's me throwing the fastball, and Al, once in a while, will hit a good shot back to the box.  Whereas Test, even in a worst-case scenario, is going to dribble back weakly to the mound.  So Test is my man now, simply because he has no comeback power.  That's true.  He has no offense.  He's got less of a sense of humor than Bob Holley.  He's big, but he's big, though.  He is big.  He's got large teeth, too.  He's kind of like a single-team liner. 
[01:24:00]  Well, you know, I was in Toronto doing a book signing.  Do you guys know I had a new book out?  No, why don't you tell them, Mick?  I just finished it, man.  You should get a book, Mick, and call it Foley is Good.  That'd be a good idea.  Yeah, that would be an excellent idea.  I think it would be a bestseller on the New York Times.  Mick, let the rest of the guys write a book, will you?  I'm going.  I think I'm done with the Foley memoirs.  Are you?  I think the audience just about tapped out on my stories, even if they are pretty entertaining.  I enjoyed the second book as much as the first, Mick.  Yeah, yeah, I think so, too.  And I think the first one had so many damn injuries in it that it got in the way of all the fun stuff. 
[01:24:30]  I thought I wrote a fun book, and every reviewer, and the reviewers liked it, but they were like,  oh, he's lost his ear, and he's had stinches, all the stuff that wrestling fans knew and accepted  and just took for granted in it.  You know, the rest of the world, that was kind of a big deal.  Well, you did bring up the penis suplex in this one.  Yes, the penis suplex.  Yes.  But I just want to point out that that's not the first time that the Dick Mango trio  have made a public appearance. 
[01:25:00]  You've got to talk about that a little bit.  Big Jim and the twins are notorious for coming out at different times when they're not supposed to.  Right.  That's because Al doesn't wear underwear.  Right.  During his matches.  And your junk just fell out, Al.  Well, no, it was completely intentional.  And what happened was, it all started in Kuwait when I took a picture with some small children,  and the mother pointed out to me that things were not all quite there.  Well, they were all quite there.  That was a beautiful dude.  Right.  And then the next time was in Louisville with Triple H, and he went to suplex me, and then, of course, again... 
[01:25:30]  Your junk comes flying out?  Yeah, yeah.  Not flying out, just kind of...  Where did it come out?  Like the bottom of your shorts or something?  The shorts pulled over.  But in my case, it was...  I was upside down, and, you know...  His gimmick...  Did he hold you up a little longer?  His gimmick was hanging out.  Everything, yeah.  His gimmick.  When Bob Holly did it, with my intervention, that was when I...  Yeah, then, you know, every time Bob Holly would go to suplex me, he'd hold me up there 
[01:26:00]  for like five minutes.  So I'd like, you know, he wouldn't know...  Shaking him, trying to get him out.  Well, no, he'd just hold me up there, because he's, you know, he's retard strong.  So I would like to start pointing at his package, and I would start, you know, making hand signals,  and the crowd would pop.  Well, he was getting hot.  He didn't know how to get me back.  Well, Mick pulls him aside one night in Montreal and goes,  I knew something was coming up.  We're in the match.  We're going at it.  Boom, he hooks me.  And I was like, uh-oh, this is not good. 
[01:26:30]  And he just muscled me up, and he was so strong, he held me up there and just, whoop,  pulled the pants over and, whoop!  The crowd went absolutely silent.  They didn't know what it, you know, for a second they were just in shock,  either because of the diminutive size, because we normally...  Because we run ice arenas, okay?  You know, a lot of shrinks.  Right, it's cold.  Very cold.  Yeah.  Because it was in a mineral winter, Montreal, up north, ice arena, very chilly.  You've got a grower, not a shower.  Right.  And also, I think I pointed out in the book that the singlet, you know, 
[01:27:00]  it holds the guys in so it's good for protection,  but not necessarily good for displaying the organ at it.  Because it will push stuff up inside you to where you almost have the ovaries.  Yeah, it squeezes you in for a good...  You've got it all freaking out.  You've got to shake it out like a set of folded sheets.  Right, yeah.  To the dimensions it's supposed to be.  Punch it a little bit, kick it around, slam it against the wall, and it wakes up.  Cuff your carrot, you know.  I got you.  Yeah, it's like just wearing maybe bathing trunks or something in a pool,  and then you get out and pull it down, 
[01:27:30]  and it just looks like this little cocktail frank stuck in some seaweed.  All wrapped up, and you really got...  You know, it's hard.  You know, that's a good example, but the way I described it in the book was  it appeared as if a sparrow's egg was peeking out of a vulture's nest.  It's also been described as a grub worm burrowing out of a fur coat.  A grub worm.  But, you know, it's through self-protection.  You know, stuff pulls up because you're getting knocked around.  Sure.  You don't want to get...  It's protection.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Ah, yeah.  Now, have you ever got McFoley back for that, Al?  No, because I don't want to.  I don't want to see that.  Really?  No.  Well...  You can only imagine.  No, you can't.  No, really, you can't.  And I don't think you want to.  Using your imagination like that's termed a nightmare.  You don't want to...  Really?  No injuries down there?  For me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me see.  You lost your ear.  I'm just wondering if there's other injuries no one knows about.  Well...  You know what?  The strangest injury I ever saw was...  I was in a match just in the WCW days. 
[01:28:30]  And Ron Simmons did...  Something happened to him on the ropes.  And he got out.  And he had a laceration that completely went around the circumference of his penis.  Oh, God.  My son's laughing at that one.  The only other guy that could have done that would have been Scorpio.  The guy was...  If he'd have gotten an erection, he would have passed out because all the blood would have  looked.  Yeah.  But Ron said the biggest difficulty...  He was standing in for anaconda.  He had to try to convince his wife that it happened in the wrestling match. 
[01:29:00]  And I was in the match.  Man, right?  Hey, Al, I got a good one.  A Ron Simmons joke.  Ron Simmons trick.  You know who Chilly Willy is?  He's an independent guy.  Right, yeah.  And he does like...  All the day, he does like the kind of shuck and jive like the old 70s black characters  used to do in wrestling.  Sure.  So I pulled Ron over.  I said, Ron, you see that guy, Chilly Willy?  And Ron goes, yeah.  Yeah, man.  When he comes back through the door, you know, he's going to be all excited because he's  wrestling in front of a big crowd.  He's used to working in armories in high schools.  I said, tell him he just set the black man back 20 years. 
[01:29:30]  So Chilly Willy comes through the thing and he's pumped, you know.  There's a crowd that actually got into him and he is pretty good at what he does.  I said, hey, hey, man.  Ron Simmons is looking for you.  And I see Ron and Ron's like giving him the, you know, like, come over here.  Come here, man.  And then I hear Ron going, what the hell do you think you're doing?  You just sent the black man back 30 years.  Shucking and jiving.  And then the guy was just kind of like, he didn't know what the hell to do, you know. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, he was like, I'm sorry, sir.  I don't know what to say.  And then Ron let him know he's just kidding.  That's funny.  Yeah.  You know, believe it or not, this rivalry with me and Al has resulted in a couple of offers from Hollywood.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I even called Al.  There's two things I wanted to do.  I wanted to break the Guinness Book of World Records for most roller coasters ridden in 24 hours.  Yeah, because we travel around the country and do that all the time.  Really? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, we look at life on the road as a paid amusement park vacation trip.  Yeah.  And then that was easy.  That was like, I didn't have to muster up much courage.  And then I had to say, Al, and also, there's people asking if I want to be in movies with you.  And I was like, not those one kind.  What kind of movies are you getting?  They liked the camaraderie and stuff.  We took this inside joke, you know, that went from just making fun of each other in the dressing room, 
[01:31:00]  then into the Internet, and then, you know, let's face it, there was no Al Snow biography or autobiography.  If it was, it would be so thin it would only have one side to it.  Well, if it weren't for me and your penis, you wouldn't, you know.  Of course, your penis would just be a short story.  Very good.  Very good, Al.  I'm going to have to make a test comment here.  I'm not giving you props.  Look at that.  Listen, I'm going to let Al enjoy his day.  Dewey, what am I supposed to do an hour ago?  Play what with you?  Soccer.  Soccer.  All right.  Why don't you go?  Soccer.  I've got to go take a soccer break. 
[01:31:30]  Be a dad.  Al, congratulations.  You're supposed to be great.  So, and ONA, I'll talk to you soon.  I don't think it's fair.  When I was on the show, remember?  Yeah.  I came in, and I gave and gave and gave.  Gave, right.  And now you're on syndication.  You're bringing Al Snow in live.  I know.  Doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.  Yeah, Al.  Mick, I'm begging you to just, hi, Mick.  It's Taz.  How are you?  Where's the heat, brother?  Damn.  I know you're like 13 years.  You put me in your book.  15 years.  You put a picture of me in your book, and you talk about Seinfeld, bury me to Vince, and 
[01:32:00]  then you come out, you don't even say hello to me.  Not even a hi.  Nothing.  And on the cover of the book, stole your colors.  Yes, he did steal your colors.  I know.  You were trying to joke around about it.  I could tell you were hot.  Yeah, I was ribbing on a square.  Yeah, he was hot.  Taz was going to sue Halloween at one point.  All right.  Mick Foley, we've got to let you go.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Come and see us soon, please.  I will, I will.  See you, Taz.  See you, Mick.  All right.  In the studio, Al Snow and Taz from the WWF.  We've got to talk about Tough Enough for a little while. 
[01:32:30]  Yes, we do.  Damn it, we're here to do a job.  It's debuting on MTV June 21st at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Sounds like it's going to be a really good show.  We'll get into the details next, okay?  Can I get a glass of water?  Ask Ben.  Yeah, Ben.  Whatever you want.  Thanks.  Whatever you want, he says.  So you'll be like, syndication now.  Opie and Anthony are finally syndicated.  Woo-hoo!  And to celebrate, they're going to be at Mulcahy's in Wanta, Long Island this Thursday  with Dr. Dirty, Mr. John Belby.  The show starts at 9 p.m., so come on down and hang with the guys this Thursday at Mulcahy's 
[01:33:00]  in Wanta, Long Island.  From 1027, WNEW.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yeah, the Planet Java sampling trucks, they're crisscrossing the tri-state area for months  now.  And this Thursday, June 21st, they're making a big-time appearance in New Jersey at the  Keensburg Water and Amusement Park from 1 to 5 p.m.  Stop by for a wet and wild time and sample the coolest drink to hit the streets yet.

[01:34:30]  In the studio today from the WWF, Al Snow and Taz.  Yeah.  Got tough enough on MTV.  Debuts June 21st.  Very cool.  But you were talking about your favorite Flintstones episode today.  Yeah, you know, and years go by because I don't sit there in front of the Cartoon Network every day.  I fly by it.  Don't lie.  All right, I do.  You like Dexter's Laboratory, don't you?  Oh, yes.  One of my favorites.  That's a good one, isn't it?  I watch a lot of television.  I grew up, like, watching television.  It was my whole life growing up. 
[01:35:00]  Don't they?  You don't have to explain to me.  I don't have a life either.  You like that kid from the HBO.  Remember that show?  Yeah.  What was the show called?  That was, uh, with Brian Ben-Ben was in it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd just sit there and watch the TV as you grew up.  That was me.  I was in front of the TV all the time.  What's his name?  Brian Ben-Ben?  Brian Ben-Ben.  Ben-Ben.  And they had to, like my mother, had to just say, get out of the house.  What are you doing?  Go out.  You look like you, it's surprising because you look very athletic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Taz.  Thank you.  All that cough syrup that your mother used to feed me as a kid.  Yeah, that helps.  Believe me.  NyQuil. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  It's good stuff.  Puts you right out.  I mean, Taz, do you have a problem with Anthony?  You don't like the pythons?  Pythons?  Last time I've seen arms like that, they were hanging out of a nest.  If you want a little definition, if you want a little definition in your arms, you might  want to roll the sleeve up and put a pack of cigarettes in.  You might grow a deltoid that way.  That's actually called the shoulder of a deltoid, so you know.  Is that it?  Yes.  I'm not too hip on the muscle turns.  I'm so shocked.  Yeah, because you obviously got him.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  You're hiding him.  You're hiding him right now, but you get him.  He's like a buck fifty with a brick in his pocket.  All right.  Anyway, I was watching on TV.  You know what?  What would you guys do if we just make this the Alan Taz show?  Yeah, that'd be good.  Yeah.  And Philadelphia would love us.  Yeah, I think we would love us.  I think we would lose a lot of listeners, but if you guys want to do that, sure.  Now, what does that mean?  Will you take a shot at us?  Well, we'd give our guests bottled water.  And should we lose stuff enough?  Being an Opie, maybe?  No.  You don't want to do that.  No?  No?  No.  I thought we were all just having fun. 
[01:36:30]  Why aren't you smiling anymore?  He never smiles.  Oh, no.  Because you get...  Look.  You know what happened about the water.  Didn't you have something to say, anyway?  I'm over here stepping on Anthony's jokes.  First of all, what's wrong with the water?  You gave me a...  Me and Al, look.  We got your water.  Al and I are high...  What's the word?  Not high.  But...  Athletes.  Elite.  High-impact elite athletes.  Right.  Who do you think you are?  Triple H?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That is insane.  See, now, I got a hell of a comeback.  But I won't say it. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, go ahead.  No, I won't say it.  Say this, sir.  I won't say it.  I know what you're talking about.  I'm not going to...  That's cheap.  See, I wouldn't do that.  All right.  I wouldn't say that.  But I noticed you got a bottle of water, and I got a frigging cup of water like an animal.  I get treated.  This bottle...  And Rick's up to something.  This bottle of water is about two years old.  They just keep filling it up.  Right.  Anyway, so, Anthony, you were talking about the...  We're just going past that.  Your favorite episode of the first episode?  He's a pussy.  They used the same thing on me last time. 
[01:37:30]  You used to know what I'm begging you.  Come on.  What?  What happened?  You're in some...  Can I hear the Flintstone deal?  Oh, what?  You ever watch?  You ever watch?  Yes, I know Barney Rubble, the whole guy.  No, but it wasn't even so much that.  I wait.  I wait.  Like, years go by.  And then my favorite episode...  You ever see the one with Rock Quarry?  No.  But I am Rock Quarry.  Right?  You ever see that guy?  The act was finally on last night.  I'm just going around.  And my favorite part of that whole thing, if you're a fan of the show, at the end, when 
[01:38:00]  he finally goes, hmm, I won't be Gus Schultz anymore.  Because he said he was Gus Schultz.  He said, I'll be Gus Schultz because I'm sick of Holly Rock.  So he hangs out with Fred and Barney.  He goes bowling.  And he's bored assless.  He's just bored.  He doesn't want to be Gus Schultz anymore.  I miss Holly Rock.  My fans, the adulation.  And he decides now he's going to tell everybody, hmm, I'll tell them I'm Rock Quarry.  They'll get a big kick out of it.  So they don't believe him.  But when he acts out the movies he was in, okay, I'll prove it. 
[01:38:30]  You might remember me from Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  And he musters up his hair, turns around, and goes, ah, in front of him.  I'm pissing myself.  I swear to God.  I was dying.  And then he goes, and you might remember shootout at the OK Rock Chorale.  Pow, pow, pow.  And they're all just like, ha, ha, ha, oh, Gus, you ass.  Well, they didn't say ass.  It was a cartoon for the play song.  And then the last one was, and you might remember my musical, The Dancing Playboy.  And he starts dancing.  And Fred comes up and starts laughing at him. 
[01:39:00]  This is the best part.  He gets so pissed off, he cocks his foot back, kicks Fred right across the room.  He kicks him right across the room, Norton.  I'm dying.  My favorite episode of all time.  You know what you've got to do for these guys?  He's so obsessed with the Flintstones, he could do the fake Fred Flintstone voice.  Do the fake one.  This was terrible.  Back after the guy that did Fred's voice died.  Right.  What was his name?  Fred. 
[01:39:30]  Alan Reed.  Was that it?  Alan Reed.  I don't know.  Don't ask.  Yeah.  Alan Reed.  But do you remember the fake Fred?  Yes.  No.  I don't remember.  After he died, they kept the Flintstones going.  Don't get upset.  It's a cartoon.  You get so hot.  Relax.  I'm thinking back when I was a kid, and this was very upsetting to me.  It's like a big thing.  Fred died.  This is a big deal.  And to a kid, when you're watching a cartoon, and all of a sudden the voice changes, it sucked.  It wasn't Fred anymore.  Well, obviously, this is something you need to address in therapy.  So, I think I should.  Yes.  So, Barney, and talking Barney's voice is the same. 
[01:40:00]  He's like, hey, Fred, let's go bowling.  Remember when Barney's voice changed, too?  Yeah.  He started talking like this or something.  It was terrible.  They had the job Barney come in and do it.  It wasn't like a puberty thing, you know what I mean?  Like going through a puberty.  No, they were adults.  What's wrong with you?  A lot of things.  But I'm not sitting around watching the Flintstones.  But Tassie...  He does the fake Fred.  The fake Fred was...  Barney would just be like, hey, Fred, let's go out.  And he'd be, okay, Barney.  And you're like, what? 
[01:40:30]  Hey, Barney, I'll get my bowling ball.  And you're like, what the, Fred?  What the frig is that?  It's not Fred.  What the hell happened to Fred?  I take my cartoons very seriously, Tass.  Yes.  Very seriously.  I've noticed that, Ant.  It's a big, important part of my life.  Yes.  And you're like in your early 20s and you're still watching cartoons.  Oh, yeah, right.  So let's talk about Tough Enough.  Tough Enough.  Let's talk about it.  I thought that's why we came here today, but...  You come and hang out.  I always come here and hang out.  You know that.  We were pals. 
[01:41:00]  Talk about The Simpsons, too.  Oh, yeah.  You watch it all the time, right?  That's a great cartoon, too.  That is one.  Coming out on DVD also.  Right.  Tough Enough, guys.  Okay, enough of that.  Let's go.  Go ahead, Ant.  Be more funny.  What's it all about?  Homer.  What's it all about?  What's the Tough Enough all about?  I saw the promos.  It looks good.  You go ahead.  It's going to be on MTV, 10 o'clock.  Yeah, just start at day 2.  Let me give it the big...  If you want to do the basic plug, go ahead, you do it.  Let me give it the big stuff.  Do the radio voice plug.  We don't have radio voices here. 
[01:41:30]  I'm sure Anthony can do a radio voice guy.  Today, everybody, it's going to be Thursdays.  That's the voice.  What time is it?  Well, tonight it's a WWF restaurant here in New York.  It's an entertainment complex.  It's an entertainment complex.  You're going to have a sneak preview party for Tough Enough, right?  Everybody's invited, too.  Yes, the public, that means it's open to the public for all you nimrods out there.  Yeah, that means that all of New York, including you two.  Yes.  And Philadelphia.  I mean, it's only a two-hour hall. 
[01:42:00]  And Chicago.  Get on a plane now.  Yeah, get on a plane now.  And it's...  What happened?  It was like a noise.  I don't know.  Okay, I guess not.  Anyway, so Tough Enough starts this...  Al, let's start plugging it.  We've got to plug it.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  They used to say...  Let me do it.  I curse.  So they have to hit the button.  So they have to hit the drop.  Because they get me hot.  What's your problem, man?  Because you use the same one all the time.  The Cartman, that one. 
[01:42:30]  It's...  All right, we'll find some new ones.  All right.  Do some new stuff.  What do you think this is?  WWF?  Where you could say, like, the S word and go,  Hey, I'm sick of this.  It...  Beep.  They beeped after the fact.  Oh, thank God they beeped out was.  I love that, man.  See, we watch.  Check, please.  Check.  As long as they can go to the authorities or whatever and go,  Hey, we're trying. 
[01:43:00]  Everything's fine.  Just a little swollen.  Almost had it that time.  Yeah, who the hell's on the curse button?  Hey, you stupid ock.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  I love that.  All right.  Tough enough.  Tough enough.  What's it all about now?  What is this?  What's the premise of tough enough?  If 13 people come, they want to be...  It's not like any other reality show.  Like, you guys had that Survivor chick in here that ate the bugs and all that stuff.  Yeah.  Whatever her name was.  She was annoyed.  Which one? 
[01:43:30]  Kimmy?  The one Long Island one.  No, we like Kimmy.  Dice Clay was here, yeah.  She had sex with Kevin James.  Kimmy gets naked for us.  King of Queen.  King of Queen.  We like that.  I'm very proud of him.  That's very nice.  It's not a reality show where people come on and degrade themselves.  from money and it's not...  No.  And it's not a reality show.  That really sucked.  Yeah, that was bad.  For Taz to paraphrase, yeah, that was...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, where you just, you know, they want to be TV stars.  These guys have come on and they want to have... 
[01:44:00]  They have a dream.  They want to be WWE superstars.  And is there...  Is somebody actually going to get to be a wrestler?  Yeah.  A man and a woman.  Yes.  One guy and one girl.  Yes.  And what do they have to go through now to get through this?  Hell.  It's got to be...  Hell.  Really hell.  I just see the...  I see the promos of Taz just yelling at people in that.  That right away, I'd be like, where's the door?  That's on a good day.  Yeah.  Really.  That's when he's happy.  Yeah.  Get a little physical.  Wait, you throw him around the ring?  Yeah.  Well, see, the thing was, like, people thought Al and I were playing good cop, bad cop. 
[01:44:30]  We weren't.  Al's actually a nice guy, but then when he gets in the ring, he's smiling and beating  people up.  It's just for me.  At least you know where I'm coming from.  He's like...  Yeah, that's deceptive.  Yeah, that's bad with him, because with Al, you don't know what he's going to do.  Al comes off like a fun guy and everything.  Yeah, nice guy, family man.  And then he just slams you.  Just like kills you and says, now, listen, let me tell you what you did wrong with.  The kid's, like, all bent up.  Come on, get off your ass, you son of a bitch.  You know, and I'm yelling at them.  And Al's like, Taz, you're a little hard on them.  And he's like, let me show you how you hurt them.  You know? 
[01:45:00]  So, I mean, but, you know, this is what happens.  Taz has got the one kid on the ground, and he's literally choking him out.  Yeah, he's doing the funky chicken on the ground.  The kid's like, yeah.  But, you know, but the show is good.  And Taz is going, if you throw up on me, I'm choking your ass out, you bastard.  But how is this going to play out?  You've got the 13 potential WWF superstars, right?  Right.  And then are you guys voting someone out, or, I mean?  We kind of, every week, as you see the show progress, either they get voted off, or they  kind of weed themselves out.  Because the show is, you know, we, Al and I, you know, we went into it, and Tori and Jack 
[01:45:30]  and the other trainers, we went into it more of, it wasn't about a TV show.  It was about training these people the right way to be WWF superstars.  And, you know, it's a physical industry.  And so you had to teach them the physical way about it.  Some people just cut out and say, hey, I can't do this.  Oh, yeah, you'll be spoiled.  You'll see it.  And when you check out the, you know, like we said, Sunday night, I'm sorry, this Thursday  night, 10 o'clock, it debuts on MTV, right after Smackdown, which is on UPN.  It's a plug.  Yeah.  But this is on MTV. 
[01:46:00]  The double plug.  Yes.  Double plug, plug.  Yeah.  And, but anyway, you check out, you check it out, and you'll see, this is the, what is  casting special, is the, but tonight at the restaurant, entertainment complex, site-based  gimmick, is the sneak preview of Tough Enough.  So people can come down to public and check it out and see what you're going to see on Thursday,  see it on Tuesday.  Yeah.  And every Wednesday is Sunday at Carvel.  Yes.  What?  What?  I knew what he meant.  What's happening Saturday?  I don't know.  Too much information.  So there's a, so, well, I'm begging you to help me, pull me out of the hole. 
[01:46:30]  I am, I'm trying.  Somebody say something, just stop me.  I'm begging you, somebody stop me.  So what happens tomorrow?  Tomorrow?  No, we go to the gym, hang out, yeah, we're going to work out.  So nothing happens tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Wednesday, it's Carvel Day.  Right.  But tonight, we watch a show that should be on Thursday.  Right.  This is a sneak preview tonight.  Opie.  What?  Get with the program.  Sneak preview means it's a sneak attack.  It means it's something you get to see before everybody else sees it.  Okay.  And for gratis, which means you pay nothing. 
[01:47:00]  And that'll happen tonight.  Tonight.  Yes.  But if you can't make it tonight to the restaurant, see it on TV, Thursday, it's an entertainment complex.  There you go.  Now we got it.  All right.  But it's going to be cool.  It's going to be good.  These people that try out, young athletes, and they, the audition's kind of cool to see.  It's entertaining because a lot, you see a lot of these jack, you know, jackasses.  I call them couch moisteners.  And that just, it's entertaining just to check this out on Thursday because to see some of  the people that didn't make it.  Right. 
[01:47:30]  Just, you see what this country's made of.  Cool.  Tough enough on MTV.  Oh, I wasn't done.  Yeah.  Well, I want to get Doug in here.  You just cut this off.  Who?  Doug who?  Doug who?  Yeah.  It's on the phone.  Doug.  Doug from Springfield.  You got a problem with that, Taz?  Oh.  All I know is you're putting us through a tough enough range here.  Yeah.  All you guys on the radio.  Hey, Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Doug, where are you?  In Springfield, New Jersey?  In Massachusetts?  Where are you?  In Springfield, New Jersey.  New Jersey.  Why, you want to get your white iRock and come up?  No, actually, I got an orange iRock with black racing stripes, a big 13 on the hood. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, really?  You're keeping it gimmick strong there, you schmuck.  Yeah.  You're always getting the ring?  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  What do you do for a living there, Happy?  Yeah.  I'm a hairstylist.  My wife.  Now you want to play now?  Oh, dang, dang.  Play now.  This guy would back down so quick that he was even near you.  This is one of those guys that his whole life has been getting his ass whooped, you know,  by, like, people, like, toughen on him.  So he comes on the radio and he's, like, being tough.  Woodsy.  Yo, what's going on, guys? 
[01:48:30]  Hey.  Taz, Al.  First, I want to ask, uh, Taz.  Yes, sir.  You throw like a little girl.  Hey, Shay.  I know, you're right.  I hit better than, I hit worse than a girl.  I threw better than I hit.  Don't you think I threw?  All right, he threw a better than I hit.  He threw out the first pitch at, uh, Mets game.  Shade Stadium.  Yeah, Mets.  Shade Stadium.  That was a good moment for the chance.  The damn plate.  Yeah, what was he?  What were you doing?  You were just sitting in the crowd like a...  Hey, Taz.  Yeah.  I was joking around.  How close did you come to beating some guy's ass in that damn show?  I couldn't hear you. 
[01:49:00]  I couldn't hear you.  Repeat it again.  How close did you come to beating some guy's ass in during the taping of that show?  Man, there's something wrong with the sound system.  Say it one more time.  How close did you come to beating some guy's ass?  Probably not as close as he is when he comes to see you.  I couldn't even hear the guy.  What's the next question?  Who we got on here?  Woodsy's gone, that poor bastard.  Woodsy is gone.  We have to take a break.  Yeah, I know.  We're all backed up.  Are we?  Yeah, we're all kind of backed up.  Do you?  Yeah.  Drink some of the mochaccino, that Opie suggested. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, forget about it.  I had some of the water that Rick filtered through his kidneys before.  Are you drinking some of that...  Real iron.  Iron-packed athletes here.  The mocha espresso, is that what you're drinking?  Opie suggested it.  Java Java.  I'm going to shake more than Michael.  Michael J. Fox.  Yeah.  You know what happens after you go to the can after drinking that stuff?  The back of your shirt looks like you rode your 10-speed through a mud puddle.  Remember that?  You get that right up the back to your neck.  Oh, I can tell you about one time.  Your underwear looked like a shoeshine rag.  There, I got it in. 
[01:50:00]  I can tell you about a time in Boston when my rear end exploded after the Chinese folks.  Oh, my God.  Literally, I don't know.  Boom!  Like a stuff in M80 up the ass.  Hey, it was done.  Yeah?  Yeah, I didn't have to...  That quick?  Did it make a...  It made a mess.  Okay.  W-W-F.  Don't...  Boop!  Boop!  It!  Boop!  Michael.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  What?  Sorry, I don't want to say anything to tabs around, but I have a favorite Flintstone episode 
[01:50:30]  as well.  Yeah?  That's the Dr. Sinister one where the opening volcano comes.  Right.  The judo chop-chop one.  Yeah, who was the...  That was the one with the spy, and then Fred and Barney had to help him out.  Yeah, they're going to get ice cream or something, and all of a sudden they're flying around  and they're, um...  I'll take racks over rocks in a dirty glass.  I miss this woman.  I'm too important to die, you stupid good-looking.  This sounds like a guy that found Bugs Bunny attractive when he dressed up as a woman. 
[01:51:00]  I checked a lot, Taz.  That's good.  It wasn't Taz.  It was Al.  That was Al.  It seems like every caller wants to bury me, so you might as well jump in, too.  What's up with that, man?  Because the whole thing is people, they love to hate me.  Yeah.  No, because of my persona.  But I like you, Taz.  No, Al, you know...  I got a positive call for Taz.  Chris, what's up?  It's impossible.  Chris.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Chris, what's up?  I'm begging you to say something nice about me.  I wish I could, man, but you didn't come on as a big, tough guy. 
[01:51:30]  I don't think you're as tough as you think you are.  Oh, yeah?  What are you...  Where are you now, Chris?  Where am I?  I'm coming back from work.  What kind of work you do, buddy?  A bail enforcement and recovery agent.  So you're a law enforcement type of person.  Bounty hunter.  Bounty hunter.  That's me.  So you're a professional man.  You're protecting the public, society.  Yes.  And you're going to come on the air and try and insult people that entertain young kids  on television like I do.  I'm not trying to insult you, but sometimes you come off a little too hard, man.  Maybe because that's my job. 
[01:52:00]  Maybe that's what they pay me to do is be a tough guy.  What do you think?  I mean, Vince pays me to do that.  When are you people going to get it?  What do you...  You get paid to, like, watch the cell and stuff, right?  No, no, no.  I get paid to chase the guys that don't show up in court.  After they get bailed, they get posted bailed.  I don't know.  You know Joey Numbers.  He's the taser.  The taser.  Frankie the finger.  All right, Chris.  Thanks.  Thanks, man.  Okay.  Mr. Bounty Hunter. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I think he works at a 7-Eleven.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  He's like, you know what?  These guys are coming to Taz a hard time.  He's just doing his job.  He's not going to plug in the Swirpy machine.  Yeah, really?  You know, he's not going out there going, I'd like a Parliament light.  No, he's funny.  No, he's funny.  You know?  Bounty Hunter my ass.  Bounty Hunter my ass.  The guy's selling magazines.  Yeah.  We should take a break.  Running his own newsstand.  Entrepreneurial venture.  I'm running my own newsstand.  Who's that lady on the hotline?  That's Barbara Kiesling. 
[01:53:00]  And who is she?  Babs?  She's got the book.  Babs, baby!  Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.  Nice.  Really?  Yeah.  Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.  Do we get to stay in here for that?  Yeah.  So, Good Girl's...  I mean, we've got the Over 40 magazine that's got the saint on the cover already.  I know.  Isn't that disgusting?  Yeah, Taz was checking it out.  I'm still trying to figure out the title.  Good Girl...  It's Good Girls that want to have this bad girl sex.  Good Girl...  Uh-oh.  They don't want to be sluts in whore bags, but they want the sex that the sluts in whore 
[01:53:30]  bags get to enjoy.  Gotcha.  But they still want to be good girls.  That's very well put, Ann.  Thanks.  So, they want to take a big C in their face, and they just want C juice all over their  face.  Like camel spit.  Right.  But they still want to be considered good girls.  Right.  They want to spread their A's open for big friggin' C's buried up to the B's, up their  A.  Right.  But they still want to be good girls.  They want to be good girls.  Okay?  Okay?  So, you want to be a hosebag slut whore. 
[01:54:00]  Whore.  But then you want to go take your girl to the brownie meetings.  All right.  You want to spread your cheeks and accept man junk.  But then you want to go to the bake sale.  Okay, I get it.  Drive the minivan.  Drive the minivan.  Yeah.  But then you want to suck a C.  Drive the minivan up your A.  Hey.  We're going to talk to her next.  They call me a suck a mom.

[01:57:00]  Also from the WWF today.  Very cool.  They're here to promote Tough Enough.  That's going to be on MTV this Thursday at 10 o'clock.  I haven't talked too much about it, but.  No, that's for sure.  The Flintstones got a hell of a lot.  Because I tell you, I'm going home tonight and I'm turning on Cartoon Network.  That's right.  But this is our show.  We just hang and then we get some of the info out for the folks.  I'm doing the sneak preview tonight at WWF New York.  Entertainment Complex.  It's site-based.  And you know, that sneak preview thing tonight, Al, at the restaurant.  We're going to be there.  You know we're going to be there.  And Jackie, too, where the train is. 
[01:57:30]  And we're going to be at the sneak preview tonight.  I may go watch Flintstones.  I don't know.  No, I'm going to watch.  I'm watching the premiere of Tough Enough.  Thanks for nothing.  That's what I'm going to do because I'm a company man.  Hey, for nothing.  Listen.  I'm begging you, Al.  I'm a company man, Al.  And I'm going to watch Tough Enough sneak preview tonight.  I am, too.  We're going to be the hell on the show.  All right.  That's at the WWF restaurant.  Billy Baroo.  Listen.  We got it.  Billy Baroo.  We have a.  Wow.  She's.  How about a fresca? 
[01:58:00]  We have a.  Spaulding.  We can do that all day long.  I'm a roof of a stretch mark.  The snails can't fix his nose.  You're no gentleman.  Hey, I'm no doorknob either.  Taste for nothing.  Who dance in a living dead?  Who?  Who?  Oh.  What do we got here now on the phone, Opie?  Well, I've been very excited about this ever since Rick told me that this woman's going 
[01:58:30]  to be on the phone.  She can hear us.  Oh, good.  I thought she was there.  All right.  Who's the hose bag on the phone?  I thought she could hear us.  We book people on this show so we can make fun of them.  Oh.  Thank you.  We call it bad.  As I look right at Taz.  We call it bad guest day a lot of times.  But this might turn out to be okay.  We'll see if she can hang with us, all right?  Look how hot she is.  She used to be a playboy or something, and now she's writing books.  Opie, I'd like to point out that my six-ounce cup of water you guys got me. 
[01:59:00]  It's empty.  I'd like to point that out.  Could you think maybe Rick could run a few more ounces through his kidneys for us?  Why are they getting little?  Don't we have bottled water on ice?  They had to redo your contract so there's no more bottled water for the guests.  All the money goes to you guys.  All the resources are kind of tied up.  Would you like some more water?  No, I'm fine.  Like a llama.  You enjoy your bottle of water, I'll be okay. 
[01:59:30]  Would you like some camel spit?  Okay.  Banana juice.  Her name is Barbara Kiesling.  Yeah.  She wrote a book, The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.  Now, this is a great concept.  Good girl, but she wants to have some of that nasty sex that our slut friends talk about.  You know?  They're like, oh, you should have seen last night two guys, had me on the rotisserie, they're  playing cards on my back.  You know, that kind of sex.  Right.  But she's a good girl.  Right.  She wants to remain a good girl but have that kind of sex. 
[02:00:00]  Impossible to do.  Once you're a slut, you're a slut.  Well, let's talk to her and see how this goes.  All right.  Get her on the line.  I'm waiting.  Is she there?  Well, they kind of...  All right, here we go.  I'm so excited.  Hi.  Barbara.  Hello.  Barbara.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Which one of you is which?  We're both on the line right now.  Okay.  But which one of you is Opie and which one of you is Anthony?  I'm Opie.  Okay.  I'm Anthony.  All right.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Good.  Hey.  So what's up, Babs?  Tell us a little bit about your book, please. 
[02:00:30]  Okay.  The name of my latest book, and it's one out of many, is The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.  Uh-huh.  And what it's trying to do is show women, especially younger women, say...  Wait, Barbara.  Barbara, one second.  We had an incident.  Yeah, we had a little accident here.  Barbara, we got the title, Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.  Is that possible for a good girl to have?  Absolutely.  And what I'm showing women how to do, and again, this is kind of young women, maybe age  like late teenage through about 35 or something.  Late teenage?  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Barbara.  Well, I...  I'm a father, and I don't know if I could, you know, I would want my late teenage girl,  especially the key word teenage, to be having any kind of sex.  Right.  Well, recall that age 18 and 19 are teenagers.  True.  True.  Okay, Barbara, yeah, he gets confused with that.  Right.  Yeah, what I'm saying is...  I was talking, I was talking, one second.  Everyone, I want to talk.  Okay, sorry.  Now, I noticed, Barbara, that it says you're a doctor and a PhD.  What are you PhD in?  I have a PhD in psychology. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, okay.  Wow, so she could actually do therapy on you, Opie.  I could.  Could you do that right now over the phone, Barbara?  Could I do therapy over the phone for people to call in?  Yeah, I have an...  Yeah, I'm Opie.  I have an intensity problem.  I get very intense and angry over things.  No, I would say take some call-ins, and I'll try to solve their problems, but you know  the only problem with that is every time I do that on a radio show, I get people who  are, shall we say, pleasuring themselves on the air.  Oh, my God.  Opie does that all the time.  You know what I'm talking about.  That's why, yeah.  Yeah, it's not right now, Opie. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  What do you mean by breaking all the rules?  I noticed that it says this...  Come on, Ant.  I noticed that it says this on the bottom of the book.  It says breaking all the rules.  What do you mean by breaking all the rules?  Well, what I mean is I'm showing women who've always been good girls their entire lives  who, for some reason, their sexuality was shut down.  And I noticed that you went to the University of Southern California in Irvine.  Pardon?  You went to the University of Southern California in Irvine, right?  That's like USC, the Trojans? 
[02:02:30]  No, no, uh-uh.  No, I went to UC Riverside, actually.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Well, see...  I don't have anything to do with the Trojans.  I'm sorry.  You see...  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, but you should, though, because it's safe sex that way.  Do you understand, Barbara?  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, go ahead, Opie.  Yes.  Ask your questions, because you're such a great interviewer, Opie.  Well, actually, this is a...  No, okay.  One second.  We have a problem with spillage in here.  Yeah.  Okay, then it says dressing the pot. 
[02:03:00]  What is this, Ant?  What is that?  Dressing the pot.  Well, the book has a whole chapter on how a girl who is used to dressing very conservatively  can spice it up a little bit without feeling like that she's, you know, turning overnight  into a slut or anything like that.  Well, watch your language.  It's a family show.  Barbara, now, was this book written from your personal experiences, or...?  Partly, but it's mostly written from the experience of my students, who are, again, about 18 to  25 years old.  I teach...  Could you give us some examples of that?  Sure.  I teach human sexuality at Cal State Fullerton, so I talk to hundreds of girls a semester. 
[02:03:30]  And their attitudes, I've had them write essays about this, the stereotype of a good girl  versus a bad girl, and there are a lot of young girls out there that I'm just shocked  that they believe that it's somehow, that sex is somehow wrong.  Barbara, now, I didn't get to read your book.  Opie did at great length.  He actually enjoyed it.  I'll hand it to you.  Does it have a chapter in there on oral sex or anything?  Yes, it does.  And that's one of my favorite chapters.  Oh, is it?  That was the first chapter that I wrote.  Really?  Because the reason I wrote that chapter... 
[02:04:00]  Why is that?  Well, it's something that I'm interested in.  Uh-huh.  And I just happen to know a lot about it.  Oh, do you?  Really?  From a technique standpoint, yes.  Oh, really?  Now, please...  Because you've got to go a little more in detail, Barbara, please.  But the point that I wanted to make about...  You're a filthy whore!  ...and about oral sex is that there aren't any behaviors that good girls do and bad girls  don't or vice versa.  Right.  Okay?  It's really...  Being a bad girl is really an attitude.  It's not particular behaviors.  There are no behaviors that a good girl would never do, for example. 
[02:04:30]  Are you going to watch Tough Enough on MTV, debuting Thursday at 10 p.m.?  It's going to be a great show.  You know, frankly, sports kind of isn't my thing.  Oh, you're sticking in my mouth.  Well, sports...  I like your Fred Flintstone cartoon voice is better, though.  Oh, did you?  Well, I see...  The cartoons are my thing.  Chapter 8, bad girls love to climax.  I thought good girls did, too.  Puzzah!  Well, they don't admit it, though.  That's the problem.  Ah.  Do you use your tongue earlier in a $20 or...  First, because it just has a lot of, I think, good advice about how a woman can interact 
[02:05:00]  with a man in a way that's kind of teasing, but definitely has the payoff later.  Okay.  I have a very important question.  Now, that committee here...  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Hello?  I'm sorry about that.  They have a problem.  The producer's a little nutty.  Um, do you feel that bestiality gets a bad rap?  Uh, yes, and rightfully so.  Butt sex!  That's another one of those things that I tell my students about, but I'm completely not into.  Vaginas!  And, you know, you'd be shocked. 
[02:05:30]  Do you know that there are people out there who not only have sex with live animals, but  they actually have sex with their stuffed animals?  Is that perverted or what?  You wouldn't suggest that I, like, sprinkle salt on my ass and head to the petting zoo or  anything?  No, especially not maybe the Komodo dragon petting zoo.  Whoa!  Wow.  Maybe a llama or...  That would hurt.  They've got big wrists.  Yeah, ass cheeks would kill you then, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, uh...  You're Anthony.  You're sorry.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  But, you know, I mean, if you have trouble, you know, finding a girlfriend any other way, 
[02:06:00]  I mean, that they say that those, you know, monkey chemicals are kind of the similar  pheromones to what women...  You're a little bitch.  ...human women put out, which is...  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Barbara, I never really do because I've got a panel van and a large bottle of chloroform,  so it makes date night a real easy time.  Oh, jeez.  Your days of finger-banging, old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...  Well, you can see, I mean, I'm pretty liberal, but, you know...  Oh, no, wait, hold on a second.  Yeah, we had a special effects problem there. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Yeah.  So, okay, go ahead.  So, are you going to watch this tough enough show?  We were told to promote this thing on MTV, and, you know, there's women on the show and  men.  Right.  To make you guys happy, I'll watch it.  Ho!  Ho!  Thank you very much, Barbara.  Ho!  Now, I assume from your book that you like to make men happy, I mean...  Well, primarily, I like to make myself happy first.  Oh, really?  And if some of the rest of them get happy, then that's good.  Well, we'd like to have our two guests in the studio, Frick and Frack, ask you some questions  also. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  Oh, they're actually a comedy duo, but they're serious about their sex lives at times.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, it's a little...  Barbara?  Yeah.  Hi, my name's Taz.  Uh-huh.  I'm Al.  Uh-huh.  Al Snow.  How are you doing?  Fine.  So, how could a good girl become a bad girl without turning into a slut?  Right.  Well, I have several steps.  You don't just do it overnight and change your personality, because it wouldn't feel right.  It wouldn't be coming from the heart.  Like multiple partners involved?  Not necessarily.  When you think bad girl sex, I'm thinking double penetration when I think... 
[02:07:30]  When you think bad girl, you think double penetration?  Bad girl sex, I'm thinking DP.  I'm thinking anal.  Yeah.  Are you thinking double in both orifices is what you're thinking?  I'm thinking maybe triple, then, if you bring that up.  I'm talking the girl leaving the room like a glazed donut.  You know what I mean?  Right?  She was a hoover.  Right.  Barbara?  We're going to peel it off and eat it like potato chips.  Right.  Barbara, do you like it in the pooper?  No, I don't.  No?  No.  But isn't that bad girl sex?  When I think bad girl sex, I'm thinking... 
[02:08:00]  That's what I'm trying to change with a...  In the dumpa!  I'm trying to take people's focus off specific behaviors and more onto what's the motivation.  Well, if a girl...  That's funny!  If a girl is a bad girl, like you're saying, you could be a bad girl in attitude but not  in what you're doing.  Exactly.  I call that an Oc-tease.  You understand?  I'm moving a letter.  The Oc-tease.  Yes.  That's what that is.  That's what that is.  It's being a tease.  Us guys hate that.  We want our bad girl sex from bad girls that like it in box. 
[02:08:30]  What you're reacting to is...  Bad girls have got to give up the balloon nut.  Doc, I have a question.  One second.  This will be Opie now.  Doc, I have a question.  Can you take a punch?  Can I what?  You got a good chin?  Can you take a punch?  No.  No?  Okay.  You're attracted to it.  What about girls that like that?  But a hair pulled, being smacked around a little?  You know, if it's consenting adults and, you know, you're not drawing blood, I don't have  a problem with that.  So, Al, you're a wrestler.  At this point, I can't take a punch at all because I just had a facelift and I'm so sore. 
[02:09:00]  Is it the first one or do you have a goatee?  I can hardly move my face.  It's severely cutting to my activities there.  Did it?  So much that you have a ball of skin with a knob on the back of your head?  You had a facelift?  Why?  Because I was getting those saggy, jowly things on my face.  Did you go to a lot of USC football games?  Pardon?  I was a big Trojan footballer.  USC football.  Did you go to a lot of games when you were at school there?  No, I didn't go to school there.  Oh, you went to Irvine.  Right, Opie.  No, I didn't go to Irvine either.  The book jacket's wrong.  Barbara, do you have a saggy peach? 
[02:09:30]  Do I have a saggy what?  Yeah, when you worked on the face, you got the facelift.  Are you working on the rest of the body?  Nah, the rest of that's still sagging.  Really?  How old a gal are you, if I may ask?  How what?  How old a gal are you?  45.  45 and you're already getting a facelift?  Yeah.  Check out that picture on the back of the book.  That looks pretty good.  It's like seven years old, though.  Yeah.  So was it getting to the point where when you had a sack on your chin, you couldn't tell  what was the chin and what was the sack?  Right, yeah.  It was kind of getting like that.  Well, that's like now I'm talking to you like a bad girl, kind of. 
[02:10:00]  That's all.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Let me go to Anthony on line one.  Anthony.  Hey, how's it going?  Is that Taz?  Yes.  Hey, what's up, Taz?  Hey, what's up?  Uh, I have a question about the good girl, bad girl thing.  All right.  My girlfriend, she's good, you know, I think she's pretty good, but she likes to do the  brown mouth.  Brown mouth?  Brown mouth?  What's the brown mouth, Anthony?  Is that licking the balloon knot?  Well, no, no, no.  What you do is, well, you have to, you put the C in the A. Right. 
[02:10:30]  And then you put, then when you're done, you put the C in the mouth.  Right.  Brown mouth.  Brown mouth.  That's good.  Okay.  Now, you've got to watch your hygiene on that.  Yeah, I would say so, yeah.  Have you brown mouth?  There's bad, and then there's dangerous.  Excuse me, can you answer my question?  No.  Hey, be nice.  Wait, yeah.  Yeah, I have.  Oh, you've done that?  Yeah.  So, you know.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  The guy won't stop talking.  Hold on, Barbara.  Barbara, we apologize.  He wouldn't stop talking.  Barbara.  Barbara. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah?  You did the brown mouth.  Well, I've done just about everything in the brown mouth.  Have you?  Really?  You are a dirty girl.  I am.  I like that.  That's okay.  But, you know, we're talking a lot of years.  But did you do that years ago, or are you still quite the little hose bag?  No, pretty much I've calmed down a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You ever had crime scene sex?  You ever had crime scenes?  I'm not exactly attracting, like, the major studs at this point, you know?  What's a crime scene sex?  Barbara, you ever have crime scene sex?  Never have what?  Crime scene sex.  When she's having her friend.  When you have the little friend during the month, and after you're done, the bed looks 
[02:11:30]  like a crime scene.  Were you ever in a...  I just think.  Hey, uh...  I just think.  Hey, Doc, were you ever in Nam?  Vietnam?  What?  Opie, that's a stupid question.  You like fighting and you don't like violence.  God, Opie, that is the dumbest question.  I'm not that old, okay?  What the F, Opie?  I'm a wrestler, and I even know that's a dumbest question.  What about Korea?  You ever go to Korea?  Man, Opie, you just made me look like a rocket scientist.  This is Taz.  I'm usually the stupid one.  So now, Taz...  Oh, that was good.  Taz, you're a wrestler. 
[02:12:00]  Would you like...  On a woman, would you put a figure four fudge lock on her?  Do you...  Thanks, Opie.  Four fudge lock.  Do you watch Jeg?  Now, come on, guys.  Let's get it together.  Fuck Barbara.  Babs has been nice enough to call in.  It's been...  We've been drinking in the studio, so it's a little...  I can't tell.  It's a little off today, but...  But we're having fun with you, and I just want to know something.  Can you sing the USC fight song?  How does a girl go from being a fun, like a good girl, what's the first thing she should 
[02:12:30]  do if she wants to stop being a good girl and start being that nasty, dirty girl?  And, Barbara, the reason that Al is asking is because he's got a personal interest.  He wants to be a bad girl.  Yeah, I want to turn into a bad girl.  I'm Al Snow.  The first thing that I recommend is doing an attitude adjustment.  What is that?  I'll text it in the stumper.  No, and what do I got to do?  The first thing.  What is that in the back?  The first thing I recommend is doing an attitude adjustment. 
[02:13:00]  She's getting liposuction as she speaks.  Barbara, are you running self-pleasuring devices in the background there?  No, it's the gardener.  Oh, the gardener.  So the gardener's running self-pleasuring devices in the background.  That's being a bad girl.  Take a hedge trimmer to those bush of yours.  Yeah.  It's my next-door neighbor's gardener.  Nice.  Even better.  No one will be on to it.  I like you.  So what happens now?  I want to be a bad girl.  My name's Al Snow.  I want to be a bad girl.  What do I do?  The first step is for a woman to actually start recording her thoughts. 
[02:13:30]  And you do kind of a journal kind of a thing where you record your thoughts.  Oh, ring.  I need sex.  I need sex.  I'm Al Snow, and I like it in the doomper.  What do I do?  The first step is that you actually explore your mind and explore your feelings and find  out what you really want, if it is really coming from the inner core of you and you  do feel like that you need to explore.  Because there are a lot of people who don't feel that way.  They're perfectly content the way they are, and this book is not for those people.  This book is for people who really feel that it's something missing and they want to change. 
[02:14:00]  You do, Anthony?  What a coincidence, because me, being wrestler Al Snow, I love having other man ass right  in my face.  Well, Anthony, I...  Yes.  Hey, Doc, do you watch cartoons?  Yes, I do, actually.  What's your favorite one?  Well, I like Warner Brothers.  I like all the Bugs Bunny stuff, you know?  Bugs Bunny.  We have them in the studio, I think.  Well, Fred Flintstone was here earlier, actually.  I'll tell you what, Openy.  What?  I like Duck Ass, Doc. 
[02:14:30]  I'll tell you, when I used to watch Bugs Bunny dress up as a woman, I used to pleasure  myself while doing that.  Very proud of you.  Thank you.  I have a question for you, Doc.  How many pits are in a pair?  How many what?  How many pits are in a pair?  Come on, you're a doctor.  What's the answer?  How many what?  How many times do I have to repeat?  Of fruit?  How many pits?  You know what, Bob?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  How many pits are in a pair?  Seriously, Doc, I've got a question, because I have this serious fascination with young Asian  men now.  What do I do about that?  Young Asian boys? 
[02:15:00]  Why do you want to do anything about it?  It disturbs me.  I mean, you know.  He learned that from me, Al Snow, and maybe he's a little curious about what Al Snow told  him about his experiences with young Asian men.  Well, it's tough.  I mean, I live here in New York.  I'm stuck in a radio station all day, and it's not like I can find a lot of oriental guys,  you know.  It's not like a Japanese concentration camp around or something, you know.  And I especially like him with no teeth.  Barbara?  Come me!  Barbara? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah?  I was thumbing through your book, and what's the most outrageous thing a girl could expect  if she wants to be a bad girl?  Is it the anal?  She doesn't have to expect anything outrageous.  Again, it's not a matter of particular behaviors.  What she can expect is to be not feeling guilty and shameful about her take-life.  Yeah, but you girls do.  What about the rusty trombone?  You ever hear that?  No.  The rusty trombone where a girl starts manipulating with her tongue the balloon knot of her boyfriend? 
[02:16:00]  You know what the balloon knot is?  Blow up a balloon, tighten a knot, and now look at it.  What does it look like?  Now you got it.  No, I got it.  And then she does the reach around and starts working it like a rusty trombone.  Now, is that bad girl sex?  No, it doesn't.  Because Al Snow does that.  A big girl might do that, too.  A lot.  But she would just have a different attitude about doing it.  Barbara, would it be considered, because, you know, this is Anthony.  I like to roll my girlfriend's own tampons.  I like to call them for her.  Is that, like, considered bad girl sex? 
[02:16:30]  No.  At least it's with a girl, because me being Al Snow, a wrestler, I like just things with other men.  Well, you know, you like big sweaty meat slapping mastodons.  As Al Snow, yes, I do.  I just want to hear her sing the fight song.  That's what I want, the USC fight song.  I know you went there.  Yeah, Opie, let it go.  Shut up, Opie.  No, I want to hear the fight song.  Barbara?  Yeah?  Because she's boring me now.  I didn't go there.  Barbara, your book has too much reading.  I know.  No pictures and too much reading.  But still, I really appreciate the chance to come on the show and promote the book. 
[02:17:00]  We so appreciate you coming on our show.  On their show.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Because I'm now looking at finding the erotic artist within.  When I go home tonight, I'm going to find my own erotic artist within.  I'm seeing a lot of psycho stuff in this book, though, like psychological stuff.  I'm going to roll myself back in a ball again.  Well, of course I'm a psychologist.  What do you expect?  Yeah, but I'm into the whole bad girl sex part of this.  Being Al Snow, I want to be a bad girl.  Yeah, but you know what?  You know what, Al?  Yes, Anthony?  If I could ever, if I could ever, like, you know, do like a dog, I'd never leave the 
[02:17:30]  house, you know?  It'd be like me being Al Snow.  I've done dogs.  And it's quite a lot of fun, Anthony.  Anyway, Barbara.  Yes.  Thank you so very much.  Well, you know, you're very welcome.  And thank you.  And I just feel almost guilty because I feel like I'm keeping most of you from your favorite  activities by having this conversation.  Well, me being Anthony, you certainly are.  Because I tell you, I like nothing better than to rough up the suspect as much as I can.  I tell you, if I'm at home for a couple hours waiting on the cable guy, I'm flogging the 
[02:18:00]  dolphin.  Really, Anthony?  One time, I was so much, my urethra closed down.  They had to open it up.  It was like a volcano.  It just collapsed, you know?  That's something.  That should be the sequel here.  I was in the double digits that day.  Well, let me just tell you.  Why don't you leave us with something?  How good girls could become bad girls.  Little closer.  If you will.  Baby steps.  Baby steps.  It doesn't happen overnight.  That's disgusting.  Not really.  Got to get comfortable.  Involving children. 
[02:18:30]  Not really.  Not really.  I was thinking sexy before you start acting sexy.  Me being Al Snow, I do like the young children.  I was going to say, once I get out of the radio station, I go cruise the elementary schools  all the time.  And I meet you there.  Yeah.  Because me being Al Snow, I hang out at the elementary school.  We go hang out.  Yeah.  Lunch money.  You're getting some.  Yeah.  Milk money.  Thank you.  Okay, you guys.  Thank you, Barbara.  Remember, no underage stuff.  No coercion.  No animals.  Right.  But beyond that.  But you know what?  I like to make them wear clown masks.  Barbara, can you call us back when you get your peach lifted? 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  Are you thinking of getting the peach lifted?  No.  You know, I was kind of thinking of like a little lipo on the thighs.  But after this last experience, I don't think so.  But I hear, you know, peach lifting is very popular in L.A.  Yeah, they give it a little tuck.  A little tuck.  Anyway, I'm going to go because actually, I do have an appointment with my doctor so he  can go check out the results.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Give me kind of a prognosis.  Are you sitting there and looking like a mummy?  He hasn't taken off the...  No, the stuff's all off and the staples are all out and everything, but I got to go see  him.  What do you have lifted? 
[02:19:30]  Just your whole face?  My jowls.  You know, that area around your mouth, you know, that hangs down?  Is that why you talk less than what you wrote?  It makes you look like Yogi Bear.  You know what?  Me being Anthony, I should probably get that done, too, because I use my jowls a lot.  Exactly.  And I use mine a lot, and I'm looking forward to using them again soon.  Oh, okay.  So I will let you guys go and have a good day.  And make sure you watch Tough Enough on MTV, 10 p.m. Thursday.  I promise to watch Tough Enough, and I promise to learn the USC fight song, even though  I did not go there.  Okay, good job.  All right, chow mein.  Okay.  There she goes, Barbara.  Being Anthony, I just, you know, speaking of elementary schools, I love hot lunch days. 
[02:20:00]  Hot lunch day?  Hot lunch day.  Nothing better than a young hot lunch.  That or a Cleveland steamer.  All right, Al.  She's off the phone.  How's that for a cluster, uck?  Nice.  Nice.  A lot of fun.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we figured out how to make a bad girl, so.  Yeah, boy, that was informative.  What the hell she said?  Well, maybe you and Anthony can, you know, hope he can experiment.  I'm sorry. 
[02:20:30]  Look, I've been hitting the head a lot of times with a chair, okay, guys?  I saw the title of the book, and I'm thinking she's going to tell us some sex stuff, but  I could tell just by talking to her.  It's all this mental state of being a bad girl, and what is that?  You don't want to hang out and listen to the mental thing behind being a bad girl.  You want to hear a girl who could suck it, suck it, suck it.  You want to be a bad girl?  Just do it.  Right.  Just do it.  Just do it.  There you go.  Just psycho marks holding up a porno mag.  That's a bad girl.  Just do it, and then wipe it off on the curtains.  That should have a toll booth on her thigh. 
[02:21:00]  Holy Jesus.  Nice.  That's the Lincoln Tunnel.  White bus!  All right, man.  So there you have it.  Yeah.  Great interview.  Yeah, we're going to hang out.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, that was no one tasked with the WWF.  Then we're going to the site-based entertainment complex tonight for the sneak preview of Toughen Off.  And then Thursday it debuts on MTV at 10.  And syndication now!  Opie and Anthony are finally syndicated.  Woo-hoo!  And to celebrate, they're going to be at Mulcahy's in Wontaw, Long Island this Thursday with Dr. Dirty, Mr. John Belby.

[02:23:00]  We have to go to Jessica real fast here.  Jessica, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  I have been trying to get through forever.  I love Anthony's dirty girl voice.  Love it.  My dirty girl voice?  Could listen to it forever.  Jessica, I wanted to know if Barbara loved it, but I just want to hear you say it.  What?  I just want to hear you call me a dirty girl.  Oh, you're a filthy whore, aren't you?  I am a filthy whore.  You like it from behind? 
[02:23:30]  I do.  Getting your hair pulled a little bit?  Yeah.  I do, yeah.  Smack that ass.  Jennifer, Jennifer.  Have you ever seen Anthony?  Yes, I have.  Doesn't he remind you of Howie Mandel on crack?  He hung like a horse, though.  I'll smack you.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Old Dirty, what's going on?  Did he say hi to Al Snow and Taz?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you just come in here and you don't say hi?  What the hell's the deal, man?  Well, I don't know you, brother.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, that's how you find out.  That's how you know people.  You come over and you introduce yourself. 
[02:24:00]  I met, I met, bro.  I'm sorry.  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty is our street rep.  What you got?  A little bit too much coffee, right?  No, they give me these little cups of water.  Little cups of water.  You see what's happening?  Yeah.  Old Dirty is our street rep.  Anytime you want to take it to street level and find out what's going on in the hood,  we talked to O.D.  Old Dirty was getting impatient outside the studio.  He was like, hey, man.  Was I?  When are these guys leaving so I can come in and do my thing?  You said that.  Come on in.  You tell them to leave.  When these damn wrestlers leaving, man.  You tell them to leave.  We're too scared to. 
[02:24:30]  When the Dirty's telling you that Volvo, man.  Oh, man.  What are you, crazy?  I am.  That's going to kick your ass.  Where are you from?  Well, me, I'm from Queens.  Where?  Queens, where?  Almost, where?  The Ghetto.  Queens Boulevard.  The Ghetto.  The Ghetto.  You know what I'm saying?  But he hangs out in the town.  Yep.  The Ghetto.  Yeah, man.  You need something, you ask Old Dirty, and he'll get it for you.  Anything from hubcaps, VCRs.  He's that type of guy.  He's getting DVDs now, kid. 
[02:25:00]  Good deal?  Brothers are feeling the DVD movie.  Yeah.  What?  I bet.  Which ones you got in your...  Some other classics are ready.  So true.  Friday, Friday 2.  Oh, I bet those are big items.  Gee, I thought Mr. Smith goes to Washington, huh?  Hi.  Damn.  What's up to Chi-Town, Chicago, Big Philly?  All right?  Yo, you're on the mark now, my man.  That way he can get a 1-800 number and mark it to DVDs all across the United States. 
[02:25:30]  His stolen property.  Yeah, you just got to get a truck so you can just keep on the move.  When Old Dirty found out we were going to be syndicated, he got all excited because he's  going to franchise now.  His businesses, right?  Yeah, no doubt.  He's going to pick up some connections in the other cities and start working with them.  Set up a network, you know what I mean?  Open up their own McDirties.  Yeah.  How about your phone cards?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's not the season for phone cards now because we got a phone that we tap into  the line.  We make long-distance calls overseas, you know, $5, $5, 5 minutes. 
[02:26:00]  And then you got relatives out in Jamaica, Caribbean, and South America.  There's nothing better than getting a cell phone bill.  All of a sudden, it's $600, $800, and there's calls there to all kinds of South American  countries.  So you found one pay phone that you can tap into, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then they line up and they make their calls.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we got them lined up around the corner, but you don't want 5-0 seeing a whole line  of people on one phone. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  And then you call the next one over.  Yeah.  You know, we got a little water for them, whatever they want.  Oh, so you got water for your people, but they don't even have water for us here.  Well, that's enterprising.  I'll come down there and hang out with you by the phone because at least I can get a drink  of water.  That's pretty enterprising, O.D.  Yeah, see?  Now, don't give me water.  You guys won't.  What's the deal?  I don't know.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  We're doing well today.  I just want to say you guys are the best thing.  Good luck on your syndication. 
[02:27:00]  I drive to Philly every week, and you guys are great.  You've been the best thing that happened in my life.  Oh, thank you.  Feeling the love.  In a long time.  Even today's show?  Yes.  Oh, good.  As else knows.  With the day, Joe.  Shut up.  See, that ain't right.  All right.  Well, the guy was just getting ready to compliment.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you have a compliment, Joe?  Jocelyn.  Yes?  What's up?  I wanted to play What's in My Panties.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  All right. 
[02:27:30]  I got a good wow story for you, too.  You want to hear that first?  Sure.  Where are you?  I'm in Trenton.  Trenton.  Trenton.  That's a little son from Philly, right?  That's like a little 10, 15 minutes from Philly, right?  Oh, no.  More like an hour.  I'm in Trenton.  All right.  So you help us out with Whippin' Man Wednesday?  Dirty with the GPS system.  It's about, I'm originally from North Jersey.  Yeah.  It happened about, um, it happened a while back, at least a few months.  Okay.  My friend and I were driving around. 
[02:28:00]  We see a guy with a wow sticker, so we wowed him.  Yes?  There's a cop at the intersection.  The cop pulls us over, and he tries to get us to wow him.  Of course.  Cops like it, too.  Well, we would have, but he didn't have the sticker, so we wouldn't, and he fined us.  He fined you because you wouldn't wow?  Yeah, he fined us for some kind of indecency thing.  Nah.  All you had to do was wow him, and he would let you go.  Jocelyn, are you an attractive girl?  Um.  Come on, now.  Not really.  Because if you weren't an attractive girl, you wouldn't have gotten the line for indecency. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, she just said she's not an attractive girl.  She said you're not really.  You're not really an attractive girl?  I'm a little chubby.  Hey, but it's on the phone.  You could have lied.  Well, you know what, Jocelyn.  I'm sorry.  I wanted to be honest.  You used stacker, too.  Well, let me take the chart out.  How tall are you?  It's a great fat one.  I'm 5'3".  5'3", okay.  5'3", okay.  Cross-reference now.  Cross-reference with the weight.  How much do you weigh?  1.14.  1.14 at 5'3"?  1.14?  Well, you could get it.  And you're calling yourself fat? 
[02:29:00]  You're good.  You've got an eating disorder.  I like that.  That's called bulimia.  Yeah.  It's actually 2.14.  I'm thinking of a word.  Anorexia.  I think that's it.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're not fat at all.  What part of you is fat?  I have a beer belly.  I drink way too much.  Yeah, that's right, baby.  Nice.  You sure that's not a kid getting ready to pop out?  Hell no.  So you've got a beer belly.  Yeah, but you're not like Anthony, right?  You have an ass, right?  Because Anthony's back pockets touch like the back of his knees. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, the man's ass is like a spine right to you.  Al Snow's looking at my ass.  Why are you looking at Anthony's ass?  Al Snow, why the hell are you looking at his ass?  Al Snow's looking at my ass.  Because I'm fascinated by this guy.  I mean, you've got Howie Mandel on crack thing going on.  Oh, twice he uses the joke.  Good, Al.  Good.  Good.  Just in case they missed it the first time.  They heard it.  I've heard them all.  Jocelyn, you want to play What's in My Pants?  Yes, I do.  You know, we break out this game on rare occasions. 
[02:30:00]  I don't think she's good enough to play.  Well, I wanted to do it for Taz and Al Snow because I'm a big fan.  But you're kind of skanky.  You've got the beer belly.  Yeah.  You've got anorexia.  You've got Howie over here with four.  But I drink a lot and I'm willing to play and I wow people.  Jocelyn, are you going to kick?  Yo.  All dirty.  Will you stick up for your man?  Yo, what's up, man?  Don't you have Anthony back?  No, see, I got dirty hot now.  He's at the GPS system over here.  Trenton, you're really 15 minutes.  Yo, why are you cheating off on Anthony, though?  Oh, Anthony, we're close, man.  We're buds. 
[02:30:30]  We're pals now.  It's all good like that.  You goof on each other.  I think some of the lines that Anthony did, as Al Snow, got to Al Snow.  That was helping him, too.  That's what got me hot was I'm sitting there burying myself.  I'm trying to figure this out.  He seems a little messed up at that last segment.  I don't know.  What do you want to do with Jocelyn?  We could get a hotter girl.  Jocelyn.  Yeah?  You didn't make the cut.  Aw.  Aw, you guys.  I've been listening to you since...  Aw.  Aw, B.  You are terrible, man.  That was Taz.  Taz hung up on her. 
[02:31:00]  Aw, B.  Doug.  Hey, Taz, let's be friends again.  But one thing.  When you get up, just check for your wallet if you're sitting next to old D.  What?  Yeah, old Dirk, you're not going to steal anyone's wallet.  Why are you playing old D like that?  I forgot this guy's name again.  What's your name again, bro?  Doug from Springfield.  Oh, Doug from Springfield.  I was only teasing, but I didn't mean to say that about your wife.  No, I know that.  And by the way, let me ask you something real quick.  What's minimum wage right now, anyway?  I was just curious.  I don't know.  What are you getting paid?  Oh, bro.  What?  Bro, you don't even want to go there. 
[02:31:30]  You know what, though?  He was pretty quick.  Yeah, he was pretty quick.  Well, he sits around and talks on the phone and talks to people on the radio.  Remember, Taz, hook down phonics.  It may help.  Yeah.  I know.  I only host two live TV shows from the Royal Wrestling Federation.  I'm not doing that, man.  Yeah, I watch every one.  And as I said, hook down phonics.  And you watch every one.  That's the key.  And you will help my future children.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Hook down phonics.  And as I said, go phonics.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, Taz.  Come on, Taz.  I called up apologizing.  You're yawning at me.  Taz, you want to starve this guy to death, all you'd have to do is hide the food stamps 
[02:32:00]  under the workbooks.  Yo, there ain't no food stamps no more.  There's a card.  Oh.  Oh, dirty.  No, I'm still back in the old days with the tamps.  It's like a little credit card with the pin number.  So now.  Oh, really?  It's harder to steal that stuff.  You got to kidnap the old lady, then beat the pin number out of her, son.  You don't want to do that.  Hey, they're easy, though, because they can't hear you coming up from behind.  You take that walker out, they drop like a rock.  All dirty.  Now you got to get the pin number out of her.  It's like an ATM card. 
[02:32:30]  There's other.  What are they thinking, man?  They're making you work.  Break a sweat.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it's all right.  It takes a minute or two for you to put the boots to her.  Like the board, kid.  We come in and just assimilate.  We assimilate all the technology, my brother.  All right.  Now, let me ask you something, O.D.  What up, baby?  How long does it take for a 65-year-old woman for you to be whooping her ass for her to finally  No, I would never hit a 60-year-old woman.  I would never do that.  Okay, how long does it take to kick her, then?  Not even kick her, my brother.  Not even. 
[02:33:00]  Choke her?  No, not even.  She's not going to be violent with old ladies.  Yeah, man, she gets safe passage through the wastelands, kid.  Safe passage.  Hey, Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that my two-year-old son, when you guys said, hey, Taz, he came  up to the radio and was like, hey, Taz, hey, Taz.  Cool.  So tell him I said hello.  What's his name?  Christopher.  Tell him I said, what's up?  He's talking to the radio.  He's got a great future.  Does he stare at Ferris wheels? 
[02:33:30]  Sorry.  Do you like corn dogs?  I couldn't hear you.  He's eating paint chips.  Eating paint chips.  Okay, Dave, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Are there any high-tension power lines over the house there?  Hey, if he eats enough paint chips, I'm pretty sure he could get in the WWF.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  See now?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Yo, Rick, man, what you doing?  Oh, now you're going to walk away?  Yeah.  Punk.  Let me tell you.  Oh, I see.  No, Al, let me smarten you off the way this works on this show here. 
[02:34:00]  Okay, go right ahead.  See that guy right there?  That's Rick.  Rick, otherwise known as a weasel bastard, because he always does the stuff.  He feeds them little stuff.  He gives them little lines.  And he thinks that nobody knows.  I've been watching the little geeks running around here.  They all do that little stuff.  Like, these guys aren't witty enough as it is.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, but he's writing stuff.  And Psycho ran over with a paper to Anthony.  Yeah, Psycho.  Is she white or Puerto Rican or black?  Yeah, really.  Like, ooh, wow, where are these guys getting these lines from?  Yeah, most of the time.  Ooh, Rick, ooh.  Most of the time, Rick or Psycho Mark, who's in the studio today, write down stuff that you 
[02:34:30]  would never say on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just horrendous.  We were doing the Barbara thing, and it was like, how much manspin have you swallowed?  Yeah.  And then Psycho Mark holds up at the end of the conversation, and he just holds up a sign  that says, call her a stupid C-word.  Yeah.  And I'm like, why am I going to just go, hey, you stupid?  And then they get mad at you that you don't say it.  They get mad at you.  Why don't you say my line?  Yeah.  And then you go, oh, you're a pussy, because you didn't say it.  Yeah, that's what he said to me.  That's exactly what he said to me. 
[02:35:00]  You're a pussy.  You are a pussy.  So you're like, I can't say this to her.  No, I'll give it to Al.  I don't know if I said it like that, Rick.  What line was it?  Okay, well, how about I...  The man said...  Oh, man.  Note to the public, Rick's not backing down.  He will.  And he did.  You got flustered there.  Can I get him to sign something that'll say, when I take him,  that he can't sue me or the World Wrestling Federation?  Can you sign something right now?  No, I can't.  I'll give you $5.  You can't do that?  Oh, yeah, we'll write a binding legal document on the back of Over 40 magazine. 
[02:35:30]  So you're going to sit there like a badass now.  Taz, Taz, I'll give you $5.  I don't even need my chair no more.  I'll give you $5 if you have him on the floor screaming like a bitch in about two seconds.  I should, but see, you know, I got it right here.  I wanted to like him because, you know, he's the guy who opened the door up for me.  Let me tell you something.  I'm surprised at you.  But it's funny, he got right on the microphone.  Psychomark's handing him money.  Kill Rick.  I'll give you $20.  Because Mark's too much of a pussy to do anything.  $50.  Oh, Dirty, you're awfully quiet all of a sudden. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my.  Yeah, Dirty.  Let me tell you something.  He knows the deal.  All right, let me tell you something.  I got choked out by Stevie Richards and we were supposed to be...  Stevie Richards?  Who?  I'm like, they're laughing at you, O.P.  Who?  You got choked out by who?  And you admit that?  And you asked me on the air in public?  That's like saying that you go down on the street and you put you in the stocks, you'd be a gay ATM.  The guy's 6'2", 240, laughing all you want.  He's 240?  Yeah.  He's 240. 
[02:36:30]  Not on his best day.  You got choked out by Stevie Richards.  I got choked out.  His face is red.  He was ready to fall down.  He lifted me up by my neck and choked me out.  I'm shocked.  I'm stunned.  And this guy doesn't flint when I come near him.  Wow.  He don't flinch.  I'm aghast.  Oh, that's right.  He's all jacked.  You don't think he's like a tough guy?  Stevie Richards?  I could have sued Stevie Richards.  I didn't touch him.  If I were you, I wouldn't even...  Don't bring this up.  Yeah, don't tell nobody that.  Don't tell people that, okay?  Let me go to Joe.  And you can't bring that up in a lawsuit because then you'd be out admitting again in court 
[02:37:00]  that you actually got choked out by Stevie Richards.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Al, I heard you when you were talking to that chick who wrote the book.  And you're like, man junk, huh?  I'm a gay man.  You want to get together?  What are you...  He's asking for a date, right?  Apparently.  Yeah.  I heard him when he was talking to the chick about the chick who wrote the book on sex. 
[02:37:30]  And he said he liked man junk and little boys and everything.  No, it was oriental men.  I was Anthony then.  Asian boys.  Young Asian boys.  I just want to see Taz hit somebody.  I wanted to see him.  Yeah, that would be fun to watch, man.  Unless it's you.  It's funny because it's not me.  No, he doesn't want to hit me.  He either wants to.  You want to fight me?  Rick.  Oh, come on.  Let's nail Rick.  Yeah, you want to fight me?  Grab the mic.  You want to just...  You want to wrestle?  You want to fight me?  Fight club.  Fight club.  Fight club.  I mean, it's simple.  It's simple.  Fight club.  How old are you? 
[02:38:00]  Why not?  Bobby.  How old are you?  Fight club, right?  I'm 33.  You're a year older than me.  You want to wrestle?  You're a tough guy.  Let me finish talking.  Show some respect.  Stop writing all this crap and saying that.  And you do it all the time.  It ain't cool.  We come here.  We try to do the right thing.  And then you get the nerve to call me the P word?  Rick.  I think it was pussy.  Why not?  How about just some straight wrestling?  Hold on.  No straight wrestling?  First person down.  Why?  Hold on.  Let me make sure we're clear here. 
[02:38:30]  Hold on.  Rick called Taz a pussy?  Yeah.  Well, he said it like in a joking manner.  Right.  In a joking manner.  No, I think he was pretty serious.  I think the word was pussy.  Yeah.  And he looked right in your eye.  And then when I get up.  He looked right in your eye.  First person down.  The other guys were respectful.  He moved out of the way.  And he stood down.  And he switched a little bit.  Yeah.  He goes, call me what you want, but I'm not going to say this to her.  So what else?  What else?  I don't think that I said that.  You say, okay.  So you're wanting Taz to be disrespectful to this chick just for your entertainment. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  And for the entertainment of the listeners.  So you don't think we're entertaining enough, so I got to go and do something like that when  Rick, maybe other people in the show were handling that.  So I took a different approach.  Right.  Instead of being like everyone else.  You took the high ground.  Well, maybe I just didn't feel like saying what you wanted me to say.  How about that?  Maybe it wasn't your meat puppet.  Maybe it was boring, then maybe I'll just leave, man.  How about that?  Rick.  No.  You're ruining it.  Maybe that's not boring.  Maybe this is entertaining.  It is to me. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Rick, you're ruining it.  Rick, as a goof.  No, I'm not ruining it.  As a goof, okay.  As a goof, take him on.  No way.  You need to know.  He will squash.  See who hits the floor first.  He will squash me.  I'll tell you what.  I got an idea.  You need to know when to draw the line.  You see, I'll play the game all day, but then you get to a certain point.  Then you get to a certain point.  You know what I'm saying?  We've had enough.  I don't like it no more.  I didn't say anything more after that.  I'll tell you what, Taz.  Why don't you get down all fours in the referee position and then give him a shot? 
[02:40:00]  Right.  No way.  What about that?  He'll kill me.  As soon as you do that, bam.  Lawsuit.  I know.  Because I'll twist his ass up.  I know.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  And he knows it.  All dirty.  He hasn't said a word.  I'll stretch his little punk ass.  What is it?  He works out one day a week and he's got a little bicep peak.  And this is a tough guy.  Right.  I'll destroy you, man.  You know it.  What do you think, Rick?  I never said anything.  Oh, now you're not saying nothing.  I didn't say anything.  Who's the pussy now?  You called him a pussy.  Who's the pussy now? 
[02:40:30]  No, I never said I was going to wrestle you or anything.  Well, you came across like you were tough, right?  No, I never came across like that was tough.  So is this entertaining?  Is this boring now?  Yeah.  Because I bored you before when I didn't, you know, just start ripping up this sex lady  broad.  So that was boring.  Now, are you bored now?  No.  This is good stuff.  This is good stuff.  So you like this.  So now I'm entertaining you.  Are you going to watch Tough Enough online on Thursday night at 10 o'clock?  Ted, if you can entertain me like that, I'm there.  In all business, Rick, this is called a rib. 
[02:41:00]  It's okay.  Look at him.  Look at that.  The sweat rolling down him.  You don't even know what that is.  It's a joke.  Old Dirty had his back all the way.  Old Dirty was running out of here faster than anything.  He has no idea what I'm even talking about.  No, no.  I'm joking with you.  I know you're joking.  It's boring with me.  He really wasn't, though.  I wasn't.  I wanted to see it.  I was entertained.  Of course you wanted to see it.  Yeah.  Old Anthony.  Would you like me to do it to you?  No, that's okay.  Rick, you're no Andy Kaufman. 
[02:41:30]  Look at Psycho Mark.  Silently is dead.  I like you.  Doug from Springfield.  Oh, Doug again.  I'm not ill with this guy.  Rick called you a pussy and you still need hooked on phonics.  So what are you going to do about that?  Don't look at me.  It was Doug.  Rick called you a P word.  He said you wear women's pampers.  Doug, you know what you need to do?  You know what you need to do?  You need to get a glass stomach because your head's up your ass so far.  That way you can actually see where you're going all the time.  What is it? 
[02:42:00]  Outpour?  Outpour.  It doesn't even rhyme, you retard.  Wow.  What the hell are these people doing?  All right.  We have to take a break.  I would love to see one of these guys come down.  The funny thing is, all dirty, kept so quiet until you realize it was a goof and then you  start talking again.  I have my man's back all the way.  Typical Mexican.  Oh, dude.  Let me.  We're leaving.  So, uh, we got to plug this thing one more time. 
[02:42:30]  Al goes, I'm not.  No, Al, we got to go.  Why?  Because we have to.  Oh.  Because we're together.  We got to leave.  You're going over to WWF.  Help me out, Ant.  And we're going to sneak preview viewing.  I'm booked on phonics.  Yeah.  Of the first episode tonight.  WWF New York, 8 p.m.  Myself, Al Snow, Jackie will be there.  It's open to the public.  Oh, my God.  You're dead.  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark, you're going to be dead.  God, Taz. 
[02:43:00]  Hit somebody.  Hit somebody.  Psycho Mark obviously took the short bus to school.  Yeah.  I want to touch all you guys in my own way.  Trust me.  Taz, he doesn't work here, so you can do whatever you want.  That's why I like him.  Twist his arm.  Twist his arm.  Twist his arm.  Do something.  I can't touch anybody.  I got choked out by a WWF wrestler.  It's not funny.  Say what it is.  It's not fun.  Opie, say what it is.  Now it's a wrestler.  Yeah, yeah.  Stevie Richards.  Oh, you're such a fag.  No, really.  No, but Opie.  Opie, it hurt, right? 
[02:43:30]  Without a doubt.  Yeah, it hurt.  He was scared because there was nothing you could do.  I couldn't breathe.  Yeah, so when your body, you know, when one part of your body is trapped like that,  or your throat, or your arm, and you can't move, it's scary.  Can you choke someone out, please?  I could choke anybody out in this room.  Choke Psycho Mark out.  He just raised his hand.  If he's swilling a sign of release, I'll choke him out.  Yeah, who's going to write one out?  Think about it.  Think of what Stevie Richards did here.  Think about what we could do here.  I know.  Opie's writing up a release.  Yeah.  And in the event of his untimely death, I get all of his assets. 
[02:44:00]  Yo, B, when your neck falls off, I'll take your wallet and your chains, yo.  Come on.  Just choke out Psycho Mark a little bit.  You can't choke him out.  Why not?  Come on.  Oh, come on.  Just a little.  I'm out of love.  Actually, just show him what it's like, what position it is.  Stevie Richards did it to me.  Just enough to where he just starts to do the funky chicken and then let him come back.  I got the release right here.  It's all legal, my brother. 
[02:44:30]  All Dirty wrote up a release.  I promise.  And give OD my next week's paycheck.  What does All Dirty's release say?  I promise not to sue and give All Dirty my next week's paycheck.  Checks with an X.  That's not how you spell it.  All right, well, anyway, guys, well, before we go, though, because you guys were nice  enough to have us on the air with you and all of that, we're going to, WWF has got tickets  for you, Opie, and Anthony, if you could pull yourself from the crack house.  Yeah.  I'll try. 
[02:45:00]  But I think that heroin chic look you've got going on.  I like it.  It's the heroin chic look without the chic.  Well, if you wore a towel on your head, then someone's got to hit someone in here, man.  Two tickets.  Come on.  Two tickets to King of the Ring.  Oh.  Are you serious?  Yes.  No.  Awesome.  Seriously.  Thank you.  Let's see what seat you guys got.  Oh, nice.  Back row.  Luggery box.  I'm sure there's one really padded since you have no ass, Anthony.  And thank you for noticing.  You've lost that all day. 
[02:45:30]  You know, your crack addiction.  Section nine, row, double C.  Hey, Al, where is King of the Ring, Al?  Ah, it's at Continental Arena.  That's in New Jersey, isn't it?  Right.  And that's Sunday night.  It's a big pay-per-view this coming Sunday.  Yes, a huge pay-per-view this coming Sunday.  Get the hell out of here.  We've got to be...  You know what?  Don't make me come around this desk.  Now, give me the tickets.  Say sorry.  Say sorry.  I'm sorry.  But you're a smart ass, too.  I am.  No, I know you are.  Yeah.  Well, I like you.  I can't get mad at that guy. 
[02:46:00]  You can't?  No, I can't.  Both of them.  This guy's another story.  Anybody that can do Krusty the Clown voice?  Ugh.  Guys, thanks.  They've got to go.  We've got to go.  We've all got to go.  I want to know.  I want to know.  Do you make that voice when you're screwing your girlfriend?  What?  The Krusty voice?  No, no.  Usually.  Usually, I just go.  Don't you use the dice voice?  Okay, come on, you filthy animal.  Taz, Al Snow, thank you very much.  Guys, thanks, man. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you.  Next time, you've got to hit somebody, though, Taz.  Syndication now.  Opie and Anthony are finally syndicated.  Woo-hoo!

Toll-free, 877-692-1027.  What a cluster F today.  Wow.  Complete cluster F.  I want to thank Al Snow and Taz from the WWF for stopping by.  I think.  No, after I can let the show soak in for a while. 
[02:48:30]  Ah.  My crotch still hurts.  It really does.  We were taking a picture with Al and Taz, me and Opie.  And we're standing here.  What did you say?  You said something to Taz.  I don't remember.  I really don't remember.  My whole mind went blank when he nailed me in the kahuna.  Taz reaches over and, like, with the back of his hand, smacks Opie in the crotch. 
[02:49:00]  Pops the right one.  Boom.  And hit the right nut directly.  I got that feeling somewhere in the stomach region.  Lower abdomen.  But deep from within.  Every guy knows that feeling.  Spiritual pain, my God.  Oh, spiritual pain.  Yeah.  All right, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  I want to start this.  Rosa from New York.  Man, taking lots of notes.  I learned on the show today, Ant plays dominoes.  Barbara doesn't like it in the doompa.  Taz is usually the stupid one. 
[02:49:30]  Al Snow takes it in the doompa.  Al Snow likes Asian man-ass and rusty trombones.  I also learned One advice on how to be a bad girl.  Just do it.  Ant rolls his girlfriend's tampons.  I also learned O&A is a family show.  I also learned female money shot looks like camel spit.  I also learned if you drink tremble, you're going to shake more than Michael J. Fox.  Ant is a buck fifty athletic and has pythons. 
[02:50:00]  Rosa keeping track of the show today.  And finally, I learned Al Snow drinks water filtered through Rick's kidneys.  Ryan says, I learned Mick Foley is retard strong.  I learned that a shriveled schlong looks like a cocktail frank stuck in some seaweed.  Let me see.  And again, Al Snow takes it in the doompa.  Patricia.  Yeah.  Hey.  No, no. 
[02:50:30]  See, you can't say that.  I didn't think I could, but I tried anyway.  All right, Patricia.  Thank you.  Bye.  I don't think we can say what she just said, so that got dumped out of him.  You just said Rick's a pussy.  Right.  Joe from the East Side.  Today I learned that I don't need to go to the gym to listen to an illiterate on steroids.  I also learned Joe's still on hold.  Danger Man from Jersey.  I learned that Rick is no Andy Kaufman.  Jerry from Edison.  He was keeping track here as well.  Today I learned lots of shows do Harry Carey, but only O&A put him in front of a glory hole. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned Fred and Barney are adults.  And Tuna learned DVDs are hot, yo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to have to come back because we couldn't get you on the radio today, old dirty.  Yeah, I'm going to be back here tomorrow because I got a little cold.  Well, I got some business to take care of that.  Don't you laugh at that, Rick?  I'll flip on you, punk.  Right, okay.  Eileen, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned that if you drink one of those mocha drinks, those Java trembles, the back of your shirt will eventually look like you ran your tent feet through a mud puddle. 
[02:51:30]  Great.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Jerry from Edison also writes, new regulars to the O&A show will include Barry the Limo Driver, Stuttering Sam, and Beetle Fruit Punch.  Also from Jerry, peach lifting is popular in Los Angeles.  I also learned if you want to be a bad girl, just do it and wipe it on the curtain.  And if Joe is still on hold, he has broken Gary Coleman's record. 
[02:52:00]  Jason from West New York.  I learned that bad girls have toll boots on their thighs.  If you drink Planet Java, your underwear will look like a used shoe, Shunra, I guess.  Chili Willie sent the black man back 20 years shucking and jiving.  I also learned Opie would have done the dean's wife.  And I finally learned the O&A show is getting passed around like a drunk freshman at a frat party.  Let's go to Andrew. 
[02:52:30]  Andrew, what did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys?  I learned after finally watching Caddyshack year after year that Noonan's girlfriend was the groundkeeper's daughter.  No, she wasn't, though.  She wasn't?  Yeah, now we can't figure out why she was on the golf course dancing around with a nightgown on.  What the hell are you guys talking about?  I checked the names.  I checked the names.  And she had a different name in the movie than the groundskeeper's last name.  You guys got to be kidding me.  I thought I learned something from you guys for the first time after a year of listening. 
[02:53:00]  Thanks for Noonan.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Uncle John.  Uncle John, what did you learn today?  Hey, guys.  I learned that the next time you see arms like Anthony's, I'll be hanging out of a nest.  A nest?  That was good.  See you, guys.  All right, man.  That was really good.  Let's go to Ben.  Ben, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned that, well, they don't know it yet, but Chicago's about to get a real big taste of Anthony's alphabet soup.  Ah, yes, the alphabet.  Yeah, I want to thank everyone at WCKG in Chicago.  All right, Bush. 
[02:53:30]  Thanks, Ben.  Yeah, we're on tape delay in Chicago.  Okay.  I think we're done.  Yeah, that's about it.  What a bang-up show.  Oh, my God.  Joe, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned that you two guys are juveniles, and that it does have a set of balls.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Is that it?
