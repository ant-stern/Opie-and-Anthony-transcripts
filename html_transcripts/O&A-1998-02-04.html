<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts expressing their satisfaction over the execution of Carla Faye Tucker in Texas, praising Governor George W. Bush's position on capital punishment.  They debated the death penalty's effectiveness as a deterrent, concluding it was ineffective due to the extremely low likelihood of execution even after committing murder.  The hosts then graphically detailed Tucker's crimes, including claims about her experiencing orgasms during the murders, and criticized her husband's perceived lack of grief.

The show then transitioned into a promotion for a contest to win a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands with Opie, Anthony, and Sam Adams.  An 11-year-old boy named Tommy called in, excitedly expressing his desire to win the trip and recounting his experiences with underage drinking and his aspirations to receive lap dances.

Finally, the segment concluded with a trivia question related to a prank call from their "Demented World" CD, used as a qualifier for the trip.  The correct answer, revealed to be "stagnized," referred to the prank call's consolation prize.  A brief excerpt of the prank call audio was played, punctuated by the hosts repeatedly saying "All right."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's 107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks, Megadeth, almost honest, that's a WAF exclusive on this happy hump day with Hop-Hop and Eggie.  That's right, hump day, Wednesday afternoon, hump day, middle of the week, head toward back side of the wall, hump day, go Dortwicka.  I got a way to start the show today, what do you got?  Yeah! Another one fights the dust!  Another one fights the dust!  Another bitch dies! 
[00:00:30]  And another one, and another one, and another one, another one fights the dust!  Another one fights the dust!  Hats off to the great state of Texas!  Hallelujah!  Texas, I gotta say, fine job, George Bush Jr. over there in Texas, not backing down,  not cowering to the pressure of these fruitcakes who thought this girl should have lived, 
[00:01:00]  because maybe she, uh, I don't even think she's, you know, good-looking at all,  but some people think, you know, oh, she's good-looking, so let her go.  Now, is George Bush a Republican, Jr.?  Of course he is.  I'm gonna have to go against everything I believe in.  He should be our next president.  I don't care Republican, Democrat, or whatever, there are some things I agree with that are  Democratic in nature, and some things that are Republican in nature, and, and, uh, George  Bush Jr. down there did a fine thing.  A fine fine thing!  By saying, you know, this is how it is, this is the laws, I was elected to uphold the laws 
[00:01:30]  of this state, this is the law, and I'm not gonna change it, uh, and she went to her  death!  She's gone!  Goodbye!  See you later, thank you very much.  They killed a woman named Carla Faye Tucker.  Some said let her live, but I just said...  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Very good.  I'm happy, I'm a happy person today.  Yes!  A little bit of, uh, reality.  Is the death penalty a deterrent? 
[00:02:00]  Um, I don't think so.  But are there a few families today happy?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, there are.  You know?  The reason why the death penalty isn't a deterrent, by the way, it's really simple.  Let's say, Ak-Ak, you go out and, uh, kill someone tomorrow.  Oh, you're on to me.  Ha ha ha ha!  What are the odds, Ak-Ak, that you're gonna die, uh, from the death penalty for killing  a person?  In, in this, uh, commonwealth?  Oh, or...  Zero.  Well, zero in this commonwealth.  Okay, let's just say, uh, you live in a state that has the death penalty. 
[00:02:30]  Okay.  And you kill someone.  What are the odds that you would actually die for your crime?  Pretty, pretty slim.  Very slim.  You probably have a better chance at winning the lottery.  Yeah.  And that's why the death penalty is not a deterrent, because these people realize that the odds  are so slim that they're actually gonna die for their crimes.  Right.  And, and no one really thinks it out, I think.  I don't think you go, yeah, I'm gonna kill this person.  Uh-oh, the death penalty.  You know, you're pretty hyped up when you're killing people, I think.  Right.  The fact of the matter is that, uh, in today's world, we are trying to have a civilized society. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  We are trying to get politically correct and have a real civil society.  The problem is, there's a small portion of people in this world that don't want to live  by the rules!  They're uncivilized.  Of course!  She was all nice.  Everyone saw the video of her smiling and doing the interviews and talking about her  love for Jesus and how it's okay and she, uh, she's been forgiven and born again and  everything like that.  No one, uh, remembers maybe, uh, 15 years ago that this woman took a pickaxe and hacked 
[00:03:30]  a couple of people apart.  Not only did she hack the people apart, she was having orgasms while she was doing it.  Well, what's wrong with that?  I agree wholeheartedly.  She's having orgasms.  She's out of here.  See ya.  I'm happy today.  Her husband, did you see him on all the talk shows last night?  What a loser.  Is he king loser?  Boy, he really looked upset.  Dude, he never had sex with his wife.  He never touched her.  He never touched her.  Never even had any physical contact with her. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Hmm.  Well, what does that have to say?  I don't know.  But it's a crazy situation and I'm glad she's dead.  Yes.  And he's going to make all the talk shows, sir, because he didn't seem too sad that his  wife's now dead.  No, we'll probably do a wacky thing on Letterman or something.  A wacky thing.  I'll come out and do some wacky, you know, thing.  Yeah.  Texas.  The great state of Texas.  Here she is.  Came through again for the boys.  Here she is.  And another one, and another one, and another one, and another one, and another one bites 
[00:04:30]  the dust.  And another one bites the dust.  And another one bites the dust.  Bye-bye.  I hope you get to meet Jesus for a couple of minutes anyway, before they put you in that  express elevator downstairs.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Give us a call.  931-1AF.  Fax line.  931-1073.  We're going to qualify someone this hour to have that chance to win the trip to the islands  with me, you, and Sam Adams. 
[00:05:00]  Going crazy.  If you want to add a fax to the pile, it's 931-1073.  Look at this.  Front page of the Herald.  It took me by surprise when I first read it.  I am so dead.  It says, I am so dead.  But it actually says, I am so sorry.  Right.  And somebody clipped out the word dead and put it in there and faxed it to us.  Very good.  If you want to make your own headline for Carla Faye Tucker, you can fax those in today.  931-1073.  You can use the Herald and just, you know, put your own little saying in there. 
[00:05:30]  And then we got another one.  Don't mess with Texas.  That's right, baby.  Got the Texas state flag and everything on there.  Very good.  Who sent that one in?  Who's that?  Evie?  Evie.  Thank you, Evie.  She agrees with our stance on the death penalty.  Of course.  Fry them all.  Kill.  Kill them all.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  I can't do that anymore.  I effed up my vocal cords.  I can't scream for a couple days. 
[00:06:00]  That sucks.  I'm full of eggs.  What?  Hey, you know what we got to do this hour is qualify another person to win a White Ale Club Med  prize pack.  Oh, ho, ho.  And then if you qualify for that on Friday, out of all the qualifiers this week, we're  going to pick one person to go down to the Turks and Caicos Islands with you and I and  Sam Adams as we try out White Ale from Sam Adams and broadcast live for a week.  On the White Sands.  Yes.  Everyone wants to go down there with us and hang out with Sam Adams. 
[00:06:30]  Dude, think about it.  Down there in the Caribbean, it's nice and warm.  You got Sam Adams bringing all the beer you could possibly want.  You got to imagine the beer is fray.  Beaches, crystal clear water, do some jet skiing.  We're going to have a pisser.  That's right.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, some guy called last night.  He wants to go with us really bad.  Oh, yeah.  Check this out from last night.  AF, who's this?  Tommy?  And what do you got, Tommy?  Well, because I want to know if I can come to the islands with you.  How old are you?  Eleven. 
[00:07:00]  Eleven?  There'll be a beer down there.  I can drink both of you under the table.  Have you ever done a keg stand before?  Yeah.  Funnel shots, huh?  I got drunk in the woods once.  I handled all of it.  Yeah, I went home and I puked.  Welcome to manhood.  Man, maybe you should join us down there in the Caribbean.  Sounds like what we'll be doing.  Do you like babes?  Yeah.  There's going to be plenty of babes for us down there.  Yeah, and little bikinis.  Cool.  Have you lost your virginity? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  How was it?  Good.  What was his name?  What?  Nothing.  Yeah, what do you do when you hang out with your pals?  Well, usually I just get drunk and lay by, lay by wherever I go.  Usually I just sleep and puke in my bed.  What's your drink of choice?  Well, I usually just drink anything.  Anything that, like, makes me get kind of queasy.  Puking's the goal for him.  Are you going to go out and have some beers tonight?  Yeah.  Where?  Well, I usually go out in the woods. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, you can't get into the bars, huh?  No.  Can't wait until you get old enough to get into the titty bars, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to be working there, drinking all the frigging beer I can.  Getting lap dances?  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  You have a great night.  All right.  Take it easy.  Don't drink and drive tonight.  Yeah.  All right.  Bye.  Puke over his smurfs.  Puke on his smurf sheets.  There you go.  Obviously, you've got to be 21 or over.  Yes.  And we want to go down there with some cool people, so we're doing Opie and Anthony trivia 
[00:08:30]  to qualify you.  All right.  Go to your Demented World CD gang if you want a chance to win this.  Hmm.  It's a simple question.  A lady called us thinking she was calling Publisher's Clearinghouse.  Right, to claim her prize.  To claim her prize.  What was the consolation prize that we gave this lady?  Oh, because she thought it was, what, 10 grand or something.  Right, and we said it was something else.  What is the consolation prize of the Publisher's Clearinghouse prank call that we made? 
[00:09:00]  It's on Demented World if you want to quickly look it up.  In the meantime, it's Bush.  Oh, the phone number, by the way, 931-1AAF.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We've got to get a winner here to qualify them for a White Ale Club Med prize pack,  and then they'll be in the drawing to win that trip to the islands with you and I and Sam Adams  as we try out some White Ale.  And we're doing Opie and Anthony trivia.  What is the question again?  What was, you might remember a call on Demented World where a girl called up and thought 
[00:09:30]  she got Publisher's Clearinghouse because she won, and we told her she won $10,000 and  a European vacation.  Of course she didn't.  What was the consolation prize we offered her?  Let's go to the phones.  A.F., who's this?  Alan.  Alan, where are you calling from?  I'm on the mouth break.  All right, what is the answer to the Opie and Anthony trivia question?  Stagnized.  Yeah!  Stagnized!  Stagnized!  Of course it is!  And of course she had to pay the shipping.  I know, the whole show.  Thanks, Alan. 
[00:10:00]  Well, Alan, you just qualified by winning a White Ale Club Med prize pack, and then you're  going to be one of the guys that we throw in the hat Friday to go down to the Turks and  Caicos Islands with me and Anthony and Sam Adams.  Great.  All right, hold on the line for a sec.  All right, Doc.  I think we should play the call now, huh?  Of course.  From Dementor World.  We're not selling this thing anymore.  I mean, it's still out there to buy, but I know everyone has it, so thank you very much.  But check this one out on A.F.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.
