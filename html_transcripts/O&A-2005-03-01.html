<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the exciting announcement that the show would be moving from XM's premium channel to the entire platform starting April 2nd.  The hosts expressed their relief at this change, anticipating increased listener interaction beyond their current, mostly pre-existing, fanbase, and admitting their frustration with only receiving positive feedback. A caller voiced concern about potential FCC repercussions.  Technical difficulties with their equipment were also discussed, along with XM's subsequent apologetic efforts.

The show then featured a call with Sean Hannity, a friend of the show.  Their conversation covered Hannity's public support for Opie and Anthony during past controversies and his recent feud with Ed Asner, detailing Asner's aggressive attacks and their subsequent interactions.  The discussion included political commentary on the left and right, free speech, and the Iraq War.  The hosts also previewed upcoming listener-submitted Ramon promos, highlighting the humorous ambiguity and suggestive nature of the recurring bit.  The segment concluded with personal anecdotes from Opie (a broken heating system and a noisy neighbor) and Anthony (a malfunctioning alarm clock), before a computer crash abruptly ended the call with Hannity.

Next, the focus shifted to the listener-submitted Ramon audio promos, many of which were reviewed in studio by Opie, Anthony, and comedian Jimmy Norton.  These promos typically featured a "deep voice guy" encountering a problem solved by Ramon, usually through degrading or bizarre tasks. The submissions frequently involved homoerotic or sexually suggestive themes, graphic depictions of violence (including kicking a dog and shooting people), and other offensive and absurd scenarios. The hosts critiqued the submissions based on their adherence to the Ramon formula, sound effects, and comedic timing, expressing both amusement and disgust.  Bernie Getz was also in studio preparing for his news segment.  The segment also featured discussion of "Hummer Cash," a listener who disrupted a live news report to promote the show, as well as a censored Robin Williams Oscars bit satirizing the SpongeBob SquarePants controversy.  The hosts criticized the network's censorship heavily.

Bernie Getz, described as the "subway vigilante," then appeared as a guest.  The conversation began with a discussion about the most dangerous animal, which transitioned into a broader discussion on fear and human behavior.  Bernie passionately advocated for vegetarianism, linking it to world peace and improved relationships.  Humorous banter ensued about vegetarianism versus hamburgers.  The bulk of the segment comprised Bernie's satirical newscast, covering the Iraq War (arguing that insurgent bombing was ineffective), proposing bomb-proofing solutions, commenting on a Central Park art installation, and noting cleaner air and snow in New York City.  His newscast included tangents on women's perception of color, vegetarianism's effect on bullying, and criticisms of mainstream media.  His commentary often contained darkly humorous and controversial observations.  Technical difficulties with loud audio equipment frequently interrupted his newscast, leading to humorous exchanges and threats of restraint.  The segment included references to Michael Jackson, Bernieâ€™s own past trial, and Chelsea Clinton's relationship, often using vulgar and offensive language; Bernie also interspersed various musical selections.

Later, another segment with Bernie Getz began with lighthearted banter about O.J. Simpson's trial and celebrity gossip, including a rumor about Rodney Dangerfield's wife wanting to clone him.  The hosts then discussed Weekly World News stories, including space aliens, a baby born with armpit hair, and a conspiracy theory involving Bush and Cheney.  A prank was then executed involving Bernie's music CD, which was secretly replaced with "Haunted Pussy" and then seemingly destroyed.  Getz's furious reaction led to his temporary departure from the studio, followed by the hosts' attempts to calm him down and explain the joke. After learning the truth, he returned. The ensuing discussion involved speculation about his anger and the potential consequences.  The segment concluded with a Stephen Lynch song, "Craig Christ," relating to a joke Bernie made about Jesus and his brother. Billy Burr was also present in studio during this segment.

The final segment heavily featured the music of "Gangsta Fag," a black gay rapper whose songs explicitly detailed graphic sexual encounters with men.  Joe Rogan was mentioned as the source of introduction to this music.  Several songs, including "He Wants It," "Closet," "The Faggots," and "If You Want," were played, with sexually explicit lyrics and homophobic slurs.  The hosts and crew reacted with laughter.  Listener calls provided humorous anecdotes and feedback on the music, and Bernie Getz was mentioned several times.  A listener also jokingly claimed that Bernie considered *Hotel Rwanda* a comedy.  Billy Burr's upcoming Miami Improv performance received a brief, poorly executed promotion.

[00:05:30]  Don't just stare at it eat it  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program. The One Virus. Spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. Getting more gooder every day, right Anthony? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, that's what I hear. We got huge, huge news and we couldn't be happier. I must say, I think XM Satellite Radio is starting to see it our way.  One of the goals we have been looking forward since we got here.  Finally. Quite honestly, we let it be known that we didn't want to be on the premium channel from day one. We hated the idea. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  But I think because of our reputation, you know, with the whole sex for Sam thing, people honestly thought that we were, I don't know, two devils.  A little dangerous.  A little dangerous, sure.  For general public consumption. Something like that. A couple of, you know, maybe some higher ups going, we can't have them on the platform. 
[00:07:00]  Harumph.  Put them on a premium channel and keep the riffraff away from the general popular.  Alright, sir.  Harumph.  But, you know.  I'm going to get a harumph out of you.  But, you know, we went forward. We said, okay, we want to be at XM Satellite, so we'll do it your way.  Yeah.  And everything at the company, I guess we've told you guys by now, you know, works at a Snell's pace. 
[00:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, but today, yeah, we've got some good news to report. We're going to be off the premium channel in like 30 days.  That's it.  Something like that. October 2nd. October, Jesus.  October.  Hello.  Ouch.  Might be.  Might be all that Tylenol PM I took last night.  Ooh.  I'm under the weather big time today.  Aren't we all with this snow?  I've got to tell you.  If you'd be on top of the weather, you wouldn't have any atmosphere to breathe in. 
[00:08:00]  April 2nd, Anthony. April 2nd.  April 2nd.  April 2nd.  This isn't one of our April Fool's jokes, is it?  Oh, well, you know how we are.  Do you understand we haven't been able to work in April Fool's in five or six years?  Years.  Ever since the famous?  I think we've only been on the air one other time since our famous April Fool's prank.  Yep.  When we told Boston that the mayor of Boston died in a fiery car wreck while on vacation in Florida.  Yeah.  But, yeah, April 2nd, we'll be off the premium and we'll be available for the entire XM platform there. 
[00:08:30]  So anybody that has XM that's maybe driving around and maybe they're in between popular songs that they enjoy,  they can switch around and all of a sudden just land on us and hear this show with no knowledge of us whatsoever.  That should make for some more interesting phone calls that we used to enjoy when we were on regular radio.  Yeah, because, quite frankly, we're sick of everyone just kissing our asses. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the biggest surprise about going to satellite radio.  When we were doing this at WNAW and we were syndicated to, I don't know, close to 20 cities.  Yeah.  Of course, when you're available to everybody, someone's going to stumble upon you.  Of course.  You always get that phone call from the soccer mom that happens to be in the car with her kids.  And she happened to have her elbow hit the dial and it changed the channel to us.  I was driving and my young son is in the car and I stepped on the brake and, well, I had a prop gun on the dashboard and it fell onto the radio. 
[00:09:30]  I remember that old gag cable.  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember?  Oh, yeah.  Very old, very old indeed.  And I heard you talking about a boobie.  Yeah.  So?  Now they just kiss our ass.  Yeah.  We need some of that anger.  You know, they're out there.  I used to like, guys, you know, shut up and play the music.  Could you just shut up and play the music? 
[00:10:00]  Remember when we used to play songs?  You'd get that one all the time.  How about this one?  Baba booey, baba booey.  Oh, I got you right.  Why aren't you falling for it anymore?  I used to work in 1989.  That was good.  But, yeah, so that'll be fun as well, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And there's more details about the rate hike, but I can't print the email. 
[00:10:30]  There was a whole bullet point thing they wanted us to talk about, and I can't print the email.  There was bullet points.  What are we at, Hot 97?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Got audio from Hot 97.  Robert, I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over the time.  Oh, my.  Wow.  Are you insane?  How did Blazing Saddles clips show up over there at Hot 97?  Well, a lot of people have questions about this new move for the Opie and Anthony program, 
[00:11:00]  and we can't really answer them right now because we don't have that email that we need to have in front of us.  That's all right.  Eric, what?  The printer's messed up today or something?  Or we can't get into our email?  We can't get into our corporate email?  Is that today's problem?  Can't get into the printers.  Can't get into the printers.  All in one printer.  They're on the fritz, huh?  On the fritz.  Oh, but today it's all about being positive, Anthony.  Right.  This is very exciting for the show.  This is what we wanted from day one.  More gooder.  And I think I've got to thank the listeners.  They made us quite popular. 
[00:11:30]  They made us quite popular.  Opens us up to millions of people.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Now there's no holding back.  Yeah.  And we'll be able to now turn a lot of people on to XM Satellite Radio.  You watch.  Right.  You watch.  But as far as questions, what this means to you and your current plan that you have,  I don't know.  I think there's a way of locking in to the current rate right now or something like that.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah, but I don't have that in front of me.  So until we get the printers fixed, I don't want to confuse anybody.  One, two-year plans, five-year plans that you could lock in the price you're paying now. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  This show is all about listening for a while, getting hooked.  That's why we call it Spread the Virus.  And it's kind of been a drag because we've had nothing but faithful listeners listening so far.  Yeah.  And it's hard to go, hey, man, you've got to listen to O.P. and Anthony.  Even with people that already have XM Satellite Radio because it's a hassle.  It's like, well, I'll listen to them on the way home from work.  Well, no, you can't really listen to them on the way home from work because you don't have their premium channel yet.  Yeah.  What premium?  Well, you have to call them and then call what? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  You've got to make it as easy as possible for people.  So now that we're going to be on the whole platform, you can tell your buddies that have XM but don't happen to have the channel, hey, listen to O.P. and Anthony.  Check them out.  And then that person will get hooked.  And then eventually that person will turn someone else on to it that doesn't even have XM Satellite Radio.  And that's how it works as far as a marketing strategy.  Next move, our move to Channel 1.  One.  Can we do that?  Wouldn't that be good?  Channel 1.  Channel 1 stinks.  Yeah, but if we were on Channel 1, imagine that. 
[00:13:00]  You turn your radio on and there it is.  I want to be Channel 1.  I want to be Channel 69.  I get it.  Because we're outrageous.  That's a sexual thing.  Oh, boy, yeah.  That's a sexual thing.  You're incorrigible.  But we're very, very excited today.  We have 30 days left and then we're going to be open for everybody.  So that's going to be really cool.  Look at some of the confusion on the phone.  I know.  I like Brian from Huntington.  Brian from Huntington.  That's just plain confusion. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  That's a misconception.  Hey, Brian in Huntington.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, this is your old DAB intern, Brian.  Oh.  Hey, Brian.  How are you, buddy?  What's going on?  What's up?  I kind of think this is a dangerous thing for you guys because now you're off premium.  If the FCC comes out to sell, before you could have said, well, the only people who want  to hear this have to pay an extra step, you know?  Well, so now, no, it's not Michael Powell anymore, but no, the next guy, when they come 
[00:14:00]  after you or after XM, no, that's one less security buffer for you guys.  What do you think?  Hey, Brian, you interned for me at BAB, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you're not in radio anymore, are you?  Yeah, I'm doing other stuff now.  Yeah, obviously.  You're a silly boy.  You're a very silly boy.  Oh, come on.  You're my buddy.  There's no FCC and satellite radio connection?  I know.  I know.  Not now, but, you know, the future might.  I think when you were at the Viper Bar over the summer, there was some petition to keep  the FCC out of satellite.  I haven't checked up on it, but, I mean. 
[00:14:30]  It would be very hard for the FCC to regulate satellite radio.  Very difficult indeed.  It's a pay service, like cable television.  They just, it's a whole different animal than broadcast.  And plus, if the FCC, it's like the premium wouldn't really help, because once you're paying,  you're paying, you can't say to the FCC, all right, well, people are paying twice.  Once you're paying, you're paying.  It's like cable television.  That's it.  It's not the public airwaves that have to be protected and used to serve the public interest. 
[00:15:00]  This isn't it.  It's a pay service that you're getting, you're asking for, and that's it.  If they can't keep nudity off HBO, you know that they love to do that.  This is only language.  If they can't keep nudity off cable, they're not going to keep language.  Quite frankly, your pals, Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, we're not worried about it at all.  That's what it comes down to.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, guys.  If I pay a prepaid package for five years, what are the chances you guys are going to still be there  if you have equipment problems every day like this?  Well, I think they heard us loud and clear yesterday, because there's a whole team of experts coming up to New York 
[00:15:30]  to make sure all the bugs and gremlins are out of this studio.  A team.  Yeah.  Yeah, they took us very seriously yesterday, and that's cool.  There was a lot of ass-kissing yesterday after the show.  A lot.  Yeah, well, let's hope so, because I've been hearing, you know, you guys had any problems since day one,  so I've been with you ever since the beginning.  Nah, we'll be fine, Brad.  We're going to be here for a while.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  We're not going anywhere, brother.  I mean, when it comes down to this is the better satellite company, simple as that.  I mean, we have growing pains and all that, but, you know, we've only been at this for four or five months, 
[00:16:00]  so we've got to give it a little more time.  And they are setting all the experts up, and my God, how uncomfortable was it yesterday after the show,  all the ass-kissing that went on?  Ass-kissing?  I have a feeling we're doing quite well for the company.  I think so.  We're doing quite well, because...  I was at home for that conference call.  How old are you?  Some people think I'm 12, yes. 
[00:16:30]  I was at home for that conference call.  You missed the conference call, though.  I noticed you didn't talk very much.  No, because that was my strategy yesterday.  You were pretty quiet yesterday.  That was my strategy.  And you noticed they were trying to engage me the whole time.  I heard that.  And I'm like, yeah, uh-huh, good idea.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, that was pretty much your contribution.  Oh.  Hmm.  I didn't say much more.  I had one, like, line that I figured would, you know, make them believe that I was paying attention.  Like, I had a little, like, a paragraph worth of stuff that I just kind of blurted out so they could go, oh, at least Anthony was listening. 
[00:17:00]  Hoping they didn't hear the...  From my computer.  The cards being dealt.  Then the applause when I went...  We're like idiot servants, you know that?  Without that servant.  Without that pesky servant getting in the way.  We really are, though, because we know we're really good at what we do, and we've heard everything before, and we're just like, we'll yes them back to death, you know? 
[00:17:30]  I don't have to listen to a conference call.  I didn't feel like using any energy on that conference call yesterday.  I knew I was coming down with this stupid, I don't know, congestion in my chest, and I didn't want to be bothered.  Ben was working it.  Yeah, Ben was really good on the conference call.  I felt bad for him.  He's, like, really working it, and I'm just sitting there playing poker online.  You notice how they were trying to engage me?  They were trying to engage me, and I was giving them one-word answers, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Because a lot of the stuff they said, you know, they've said in the past, at this point, we need action.  Yeah.  No more talking.  I want to see action.  Yeah.  You know, because we've heard it all before.  Yeah.  We've heard it all since we started here.  It's time to move forward.  Do you think they knew something was amiss when I said, God damn straight, I had trips.  You know?  I curse.  Will you clean up the show now?  No.  Who the what the?  Uh-oh.  That's going to be, oh, I'm sure there'll be a lot of threads on that one on the message board. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, they're going off premium.  Now they're going to clean up the show.  Shut up.  Will you still be on webcast?  I think so.  Yeah, I think that's part of the package now, too.  Remember, you used to have to pay extra for the web.  So online streaming will be for free?  Yeah, you get on there and, huh?  All included.  Didn't it used to be $3.99 a month?  Yes.  So now, all right, so it's just, it's fine.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  Let's see.  April 2nd, XM Expanded Basic will include the internet service XM Radio Online, which offers 
[00:19:00]  more than 70 channels of XM Music and Talk programming.  Previously, $3.99 per month.  You get that added in now.  What is the rate increase?  Do they know from $9.99 to what?  Do they know?  It is going to be $67.50 now.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  Plus $1 per team on the Major League Baseball.  No, no, no.  We don't want to confuse everyone.  Of course not.  It's $12.95. 
[00:19:30]  $12.95, okay.  $12.95.  Well, not to mention the buyback thing.  If you already have this, if you have a long extension,  extended plan, and you join before the second, you get a certain buyback, but if you join  after the second, they're not going to give you any kind of refund because then you don't  have the premium, you know, original package, and then there's going to be some kind of  a Major League Baseball, like a surcharge added on to it.  So it's actually going to be pretty simple, you know, but you have online streaming.  But if you prepaid, no, I'm just being a dick on purpose.  XM's also offering existing customers the unique opportunity to lock in the current $9.99 
[00:20:00]  monthly rate with one-year prepaid plan and deeper discounts for two, three, four, or  five-year prepaid plans until April 2nd.  There you go.  So hop on that.  All right.  All right.  They're moving.  But it's exciting news for the program.  We wanted to be off the premium, and now we're finally going to be off the premium April 2nd.  Did you see the...  And we'll be available to everyone.  The stock yesterday?  Yeah, the stock went up, like, four bucks or something like that? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  What if Chauncey Hayden had an inside line on that one, you fucking idiot?  Jackass.  Don't say the F word.  Oh, that's right.  He told us we can't be off the premium.  That'll be written up.  Did you hear Norton said they told him?  He whispered.  It got through on the mic.  It got through.  I know he wasn't supposed to say that, but it got through, and he said you're not supposed  to curse.  You guys, let's say hi to a friend of the show, Sean Hannity.  Sean. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Mr. Hannity.  So that was really you I was IMing last night?  Yeah, it was really me.  Well, I like it.  That's the last time I called you a friend, by the way.  Which friend?  Because you were giving me a hard time about it yesterday.  Oh, no, because Sean's like, you know, I said to my audience that my friend's Open Anthony,  and he got shit for that.  Yeah.  We could curse you, Sean.  Sorry.  A little bit.  And then in the IM, I'm like, well, take care of my friend.  He's like, oh, no, man.  I'm like, hey, like it or not, we're all friends.  We might not completely agree on everything, but you're a stand-up guy. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, listen, congratulations, by the way.  I'm on XM, but I hadn't gotten, just because I was a bit lazy, I wanted to hear your show,  and I just hadn't gotten the upgrade, so now I don't have to.  There you go.  Yeah, April 2nd.  You know, by the way, that was stupid anyway, I think.  Yeah, we weren't big fans of the premium, believe me.  It's kind of nice now being on the whole platform, and anybody that wants to check us out,  we're there, available to them.  And we've got another big announcement, and it's good that Sean Hannity's on the phone with us right now for this one. 
[00:22:00]  We're going back to afternoon drive in New York City.  When are you going?  Now, wait a minute.  Can I take from that statement?  I'm here all these years.  You guys were ready to go up against Howard Stern.  Right.  And so Howard is about to leave in January.  Yes.  And I think the big test for Opie and Anthony is going to be, if you went to morning drive in New York,  do you carry Howard's number?  I mean, that's the test of a lifetime.  We've already gone down this road with a little old, dumb old Sean Hannity. 
[00:22:30]  So I think that's the test, no?  You just want us out of afternoon drive.  I don't really care.  We used to compete against Sean, and it was a fun little battle.  I thought we had different audiences, but you were telling me last night that there was a lot of people  that would listen to both programs, I guess, huh?  You know what was funny?  When you guys were on Hannity and Combs and when you were on my radio show,  I was surprised at the number of people that said they listened to both of us.  Because I'll be honest, when you were on NEW, I never really thought there was a lot of crossover 
[00:23:00]  because you guys had a much younger audience.  You guys did very, very well in afternoon drive, especially on a station that had absolutely no ratings  except when you guys were on.  And so I didn't think there was a lot of crossover.  I didn't view you as my competition because we do very different shows,  but apparently there were a lot of people that listened to both of us.  Yeah, there you have it.  So you've been having a lot of fun with the Ed Asner thing, huh?  Hey, first of all, thanks for sticking up for me.  This guy has really just gone over the edge. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know what it is about him, but he sort of has something against me.  And, you know, when Rush was having his troubles, he was telling Mike Gallagher privately,  well, Rush is just the beginning.  Our goal is to get Sean Hannity and take him out.  We're going to find a way.  We're going to find something on him, and we're going to bring him down.  So I appreciated you guys sticking up for me.  It's just so personal with these guys.  Like, I know I have pretty conservative views as far as my politics go, 
[00:24:00]  but I know I could be in a room with people with liberal views  and not take it so personally and actually have a conversation with these people.  But people like Ed Asner, they just want people with views like yours and mine just wiped out, just gone.  They don't want that view to be heard by anybody.  No, they want to really silence people.  I mean, if you go back to when you guys were in trouble over the Sex for Sam thing,  well, one of the things that kind of amazed me is, and this goes to Bill Maher's comments, 
[00:24:30]  these go to Chris Rock's comments.  I mean, we now live in a society that if you say one thing that is deemed out of line in any capacity,  that people now want to just pull this trigger and silence you and shut you up for the rest of your life.  Right.  It's like when Congress gives a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives,  if they ask, Mr. Speaker, I'd like an opportunity to revise and extend my remarks, they're given that.  But if you say something, if you do something, you're not given any chance anymore in this politically correct environment we live in. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  You can't revise your remarks.  You can't even apologize for your remarks because your opponents, those people that don't like you to begin with,  they just want to totally, completely, and utterly silence you.  Yeah.  Ruin your career, everything.  That you should not work anymore.  You shouldn't work anymore.  Yeah.  I think, too, it seems like if you say something that's out of line, but the asterisk is if it kind of goes against the ideology of the left,  if you say something that's anti-church or anti-ideology of the right, people are much more forgiving. 
[00:25:30]  But if you attack one of the left's, you know, dogmas, then you're pretty much finished, especially in show business.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's funny because if you look at when Bill Maher made his comments about the military, remember that a couple of years ago?  Oh, yeah.  Of course, yeah.  All right.  Bill Maher makes these comments.  The people that came to his defense were people like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and conservatives.  And what we were willing to do was open our minds and look at Bill Maher's total career. 
[00:26:00]  Bill Maher throughout his career, and at the time I hated Bill Maher.  I didn't want to defend Bill Maher.  But Bill Maher throughout his career had always defended the military.  And it's like because he didn't say something exactly the way he meant it, people wanted to kill him.  Right.  You know, there were people that didn't ever want to see you guys ever work again.  Yes.  And, well, you guys know because you lived through it, I think, and lived, and I think you learned a lot.  You knew about Sex for Sam and all that stuff, but I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  I think these politically correct times, I think we've got to stop.  I think we've got to give people an opportunity.  I'll give you an example that I recently used on my show.  Charlie Rangel, who is a Democratic congressman, probably one of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life.  He recently said something that created a bit of a controversy, and it was deemed as somewhat racy and racist and stuff.  And I said, wait a minute.  I know this guy.  I have sat in the studio with this guy.  I know people would like me to just use this as an opportunity to hammer him and silence him and shut him up. 
[00:27:00]  But I said, I'm going to be consistent because the next time a conservative says something that's out of line and you hear me defending him,  well, I just want you to remember that I also defended Charlie Rangel.  Right.  People kind of forget that, though.  Sean, are you going to play any more of the Ed Asner tape today?  You know, I didn't hear the whole tape, but you were telling the Opie yesterday that you guys had said a lot more to defend me, and I appreciate it.  I'm going to try and play more today on my show.  I mean, there's one part that's just flat-out funny because we call him really boring right to his face. 
[00:27:30]  Jim Norton was there, and it was very uncomfortable.  I'm much more conservative than I am on that tape.  I was groveling and throwing Opie under the bus and completely agreeing with Ed Asner.  Ed Asner actually said that the media was conservative, like ABC, CBS, which is just ludicrous.  But, of course, I didn't have the courage to tell him that.  He was a pretty bitter, angry guy.  Yeah.  Him and I went at it.  He said he would never do our fucking program again.  That's what I want to play.  I'll obviously have to beep it out.  This is not satellite radio. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, I understand.  And then, yeah, I apologize.  I'm cursing.  I'm funny.  But then Jim Norton says goodbye to him after the show, and he goes, you know, what did he say?  I like you, but get rid of that fucking wasp.  Yeah, I said goodbye to him.  I just told him how much I enjoyed his work.  I'm Mary Tyler Moore, blah, blah, blah.  And then he was just funny.  He hugged me.  He said, get rid of that fucking wasp.  I'm like, all right.  You know, I've had him on the air a couple of times, and every time after he's on, he calls  back for the next ten days complaining about how mean I was to him.  Really?  Because what he does is he always steps in it, because, of course, I just open up the 
[00:28:30]  trap door and let him dive in.  And his liberal friends tell him how awful he did later, and he's upset that he came on  the show.  He's got a backpedal, yeah.  Yeah, it was very fun and very uncomfortable out there in L.A. when we had him on.  When did the left turn into a bunch of, like, whiny babies?  I mean, when did that happen?  They used to supposedly stand for, like, being anti-establishment and being, like, tolerant  of opposing views.  And now they just turn into, like, a bunch of kvetching hens.  All they want to do is catch you in a verbal misstep, and that's what the whole left seems 
[00:29:00]  to be about in the last 15 years.  You know, it's funny, though.  If you ask the average person, they seem to have this perception that conservatives are  like this.  And I know you guys have spent a lot of time on the air talking about the FCC.  I don't want the FCC to control anybody.  I mean, notwithstanding, I don't think you should be able to curse on the radio or use  those seven words or whatever.  But beyond that, if you're not going to spell out in detail what it is that people can and  cannot do, for example, on the radio, I think people have an option. 
[00:29:30]  They can reach over, pull the channel, and go to another station.  Right.  But for some reason, it's really, if you look at the people that want to silence other people  now in the debate, it's the left wanting to silence the right, but they have this perception  that they're more free speech oriented, and they're really not in any way.  How about the one thing, though, is it seems like most of the complaints, FCC-wise, come  from the Parents Television Council, which I would probably say is much more of a more  conservative group.  And they supposedly made about 99% of all FCC complaints. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, they did in that one particular, from Janet Jackson on down, which frankly shouldn't  have happened, considering you have a young audience.  There's got to be some consideration in the public airwaves that there are young people  that are watching shows like the Super Bowl.  There are so many other options out there for racy material like HBO and Pay-Per-View and  all this other stuff that in the basic broad channels, you know, Janet Jackson doesn't need  to have a wardrobe malfunction. 
[00:30:30]  But again, there are so many other outlets of people want that choice or want that option.  You know, from a left-right standpoint, I always argue that while we get lectured a lot of  times by the left about being pro-choice, when it comes to your right to defend yourself and  have a gun in your home to protect your family, the left is standing there right in front of  the door to prevent that from happening.  They say they're pro-choice, but then they'll never let you choose a school where you can  send your kids to.  And they force your kids into these failing schools that are just destroying the minds of 
[00:31:00]  the kids.  So, you know, I think actually conservatives are more open-minded than people really give  them credit for.  That's why we got Anthony to vote for George Bush, but we didn't pull Opie along this year.  And don't think I haven't forgotten him.  I'm getting there, Sean.  I'm getting there.  God, you pissed me off this year.  I tried my hardest.  He was in studio for an hour, and I begged him just about to vote for Bush.  You guys did quite well.  I didn't want Kerry either, so I was right down the middle on this one. 
[00:31:30]  So who did you vote for?  Nobody.  Oh, you didn't vote?  You didn't vote?  Shut up.  You didn't vote either.  I know that, but you're expected to vote.  I absolutely did.  No, I'm not talking about you, Sean.  Jim Norton is trying to throw me under the bus.  I know he didn't vote.  Now, Anthony did vote.  Yes, I did.  My biggest surprise in meeting you guys, and honestly, I was really surprised just how politically  aware and issues aware you guys were.  And, Anthony, when you told me you were conservative, it blew me away. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I just can't stand the thinking of the left.  And believe me, there are kooks on both sides.  I know that.  I've seen extremists on both sides that, you know, it's hard to tell the difference between them.  They're so far out there.  But, you know, I just cannot relate to some of the ideas coming out of the left.  Sorry.  Listen, we know and I don't understand, this is kind of basic stuff.  We first met on September 11th. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  Because we both had to broadcast from WLIR out of Long Island because we weren't allowed  to get into the city that day because the city was shut down.  And what I don't understand is, and I don't care if you're left or right or center or middle  or liberal or communist or socialist, you ought to get one thing, that when somebody kills  3,000 of your friends, your neighbors, your loved ones, your coworkers, even Americans 
[00:33:00]  you may not like, but when they kill a part of your family, if you don't understand that  it's now your job to track those animals down, find them wherever the hell they are, and  destroy them before they hit us again, then I don't know what's wrong with you.  And there are literally people, I think, in this world that don't understand that these  people think that there are virgins in heaven awaiting them the minute they kill us, that  they get rewarded for this.  And I just will never understand the mentality that they don't understand that we've got 
[00:33:30]  to go out there and get those people.  I completely agree with that, Sean.  Keep the pressure on them.  That's right.  So what's the big topic today on the show?  I don't know.  I just woke up.  I took my dog out.  And I wanted to make sure I called in.  Sean, how the hell are there, what, 115 casualties in Iraq, that line of people waiting to take  a police test?  To take a what test?  In Iraq, the line of people that were waiting and the car bomb went off and killed like 
[00:34:00]  115 people yesterday?  Yeah, look, Iraq is a, what can you say?  It is a horrible situation.  I just don't understand how you get that many people that you know are a target, and  there's no, where's the security?  Where's the security that a car can pull up in front of people that, you know, they're  government workers.  They're applying for government jobs.  So they are enemies of the insurgents.  Why isn't there better security over there? 
[00:34:30]  That seems to be the biggest issue.  The biggest problem has been the training of the Iraqis in their own defense, and it's  just become an ongoing problem.  With that said, if you look at the Kurds in the north, if you look at the Sunnis in the  south, if you look at 90% of the actual landmass of Iraq, it is secure, it's prospering, schools  are open again, commerce is working, everything is going pretty well. 
[00:35:00]  But what you're really dealing with is a small 10% of the landmass population known as the  Sunni Triangle, where all of this insurgency is taking place.  You have two elements there.  You have a stronghold that was left over from the old Ba'athist regime of Saddam, and then  you have these insurgents that have basically invaded the country from areas like Iran and  Syria and elsewhere.  It's a party for them.  And they're part of Hezbollah and Hamas, because they want to fight this battle there, because  the Americans just happen to be there. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  So it's just a difficult situation.  It's a war, and it's something that the only solution you have is you've got to go out  there and win it.  And at times, I don't think we've been aggressive enough, frankly.  Yeah.  What do you think is going to happen with just horrible Europe?  Are they finally going to step up and do something?  It seems like now they want to be part of the Reconstruction.  No, I think Europe, you've got a pretty unholy alliance between Vladimir Putin, who makes  this horrible deal to give the Iranians what ultimately will be the world's undoing, which 
[00:36:00]  is nuclear technology, in spite of the president.  And I think the president should have been stronger with Putin.  You have Iran, which is part of the axis of evil.  And look at, for example, France and Germany leading up to the conflict in Iraq.  It took us to get into Iraq, win the war, to finally discover that the only reason that  they wouldn't even enforce their own resolution, 1441, was because they had financial interests  with Saddam Hussein in Iraq.  And this was about billions of dollars for them.  This wasn't about any type of principle. 
[00:36:30]  I just think, you know, here we paid for their own liberation.  They'd be speaking German if it weren't for Americans shedding their blood.  But when it comes to the liberation of other people, they were nowhere to be found.  It's kind of sad.  They're one big happy family over there now with, you know, America as the bad guy.  So, you know, they could rally around and all be chums and pals with their spending their  euros together.  But I think the bottom line is they don't like each other and they cannot keep the peace over  there.  Yeah, well, there's been this discussion, and France has led this more than anyone, Jacques 
[00:37:00]  Chirac, is that they view the United States as too powerful.  So Chirac has been trying to create a coalition among Europe to sort of be the antidote to  the powerful United States.  I don't think it's ever going to work.  Good luck.  It seems like a lot of this anti-American sentiment started after the fall of the Soviet Union.  Like, once that threat of the Russians kicking their faces, it wasn't there anymore.  But you know what's amazing, though?  If there was ever a situation where, I don't know if there's an analogous situation that 
[00:37:30]  were to arise, but if there ever comes an enemy like an Adolf Hitler, if we ever have to battle  forces of fascism or Nazism or Imperial Japan, you know, they'd be the first people, you know,  crying for U.S. blood to be shed in their defense again.  Absolutely.  Jesus.  So it's kind of pathetic.  Kind of.  All right.  Sean.  What's that? 
[00:38:00]  Good one.  What happened there?  The dilette went out.  Oh, the dilette went out.  We were going to play your theme music, and we were going to wrap this up all nice for  you, Sean, and our computer crashed.  I had your theme music all chewed up and everything.  All right.  Listen, go cause trouble.  That's what you guys do best.  Well, the Sean Hannity Show could be heard on XM 124 today, Monday through Friday, 3 to  6 p.m.  All right, guys.  Good to talk to you all.  Well, congratulations on the new deal there.  Thank you, Sean.  We greatly appreciate it.  All right, guys.  All right.  There you go.  Sean Hannity, everyone. 
[00:38:30]  That was hilarious.  We're looking all smooth.  Craps out on you.  That was pretty cool, no?  Yeah.  Sean Hannity, I think, is going to play more of that Ed Asner tape today.  He's been a big supporter, man.  Ever since the show got the boot, he has been a big supporter.  Which was one of the big surprises, because everyone else just threw us under the bus.  He's like the last guy, you would think.  Yeah.  Everyone had their big laughs when we got thrown off the radio, but he stood up for it. 
[00:39:00]  The guy really is, you know, and it's odd that you would see somebody on the right like that and as conservative as he is.  Although he does have an open mind, that's a champion of free speech, more so than a lot of other jocks that like to yell that on the air.  The guy truly is, you know, to come and support a show like ours after, you know, what we did.  You've got to give him credit for that.  I was arguing with him online a little bit, and I was basically telling him, dude, I'm a moderate.  He goes, well, what do you think I am? 
[00:39:30]  I'm a moderate.  I'm like, no way are you a moderate.  He is one of the more open-minded guys, you know, on the right, definitely.  But I guess he's obsessed with Ed Asner.  Ed Asner is obsessed with him.  So when he found out that we went after him in L.A., he's like, oh, get me the tape.  But he didn't know about the part where I basically told Ed Asner he was really boring.  Yeah.  And I think he might play that today on his show.  Ed Asner is not going to win that argument either.  Ed Asner is never going to win. 
[00:40:00]  Goddarding old fool.  He had a guy on one time.  You remember they were talking about the Republicans were suppressing black votes in Florida?  Yeah.  He had a guy on, I think, one of the guys who had created that whole ad campaign or the sign.  The guy had done something to perpetuate that myth.  And he had this guy on and was just pinning him to name one voter who was suppressed.  Right.  And this backtracking ass couldn't think of anyone.  Well, no, but we know what goes on.  Just name me one Republican that did it.  We'll get him out of often.  It's great when you just watch someone back into a corner and they can't get out. 
[00:40:30]  It's brutal.  It's like a beating.  It really was like just watching somebody cornered and just physically savaged.  That's great.  This guy was like...  Okay, we'll take our first break, Anthony.  Radio.  We got lots to get to today, man.  We got to talk about this shooting.  Bernie Getz is coming in to do the news today, actually, because...  Speaking of shootings.  What happened, Ben?  Well, no, he wants to start a protest today to save the gates.  Well, you better hurry up, because they're finally knocking those shower curtains down. 
[00:41:00]  I saw pictures in the paper.  They're already, like, in piles.  Yeah, they're showing a big bucket of bolts.  Nuts and bolts.  Bernie, you better get on this.  He's a real genius, too.  Then he puts on his website, he's coming on XM Satellite Radio.  It doesn't say the show.  It doesn't say the channel.  It doesn't say anything.  It's on his...  You troll around a few hundred channels.  You might find it.  You might look out and stumble across us.  Right.  That's how the average person had to find us.  Sure.  Good old Bernie.  All right.  Well, Anthony, on the way, besides all that fun stuff, we have 13 new Ramon promos from 
[00:41:30]  the listeners.  13 from the listeners?  13.  Maybe we'll get into that next for a little while.  Bless you, Jimmy.  Thanks, guys.  We had an assault on the media in Philly that went great.  Yeah, it really did.  If you want to jump ahead, go to foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com for the video, but we'll have  the audio of that and the story from Hummer Cash.  Also, I hold in my hand, Anthony.  Gangsta Fag. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  Thank you, Joe Rogan.  Gangsta Fag will debut.  I'm sure it's as subtle as Joe Rogan.  On the program today.  Do we know which song to play off this thing?  Yeah, let's do it.  Anybody want to track through it a little bit?  All right.  Eric, we'll track through that.  Eric, get the track in place.  We'll take a little break, and we'll continue with the Opian Anthony program.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois. 
[00:42:30]  I believe it was WRCW.  I'm not sure of the call letters.  1590 Daytimer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset Rata.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opian Anthony.  The, uh, Opian Anthony show.  You know, you say you don't know.  I say, take me out. 
[00:43:00]  I say, you don't show.  Don't move time slow.  I say, take me out.  Uh, snowy morning in New York City.  Yes.  Yeah.  As you listen to this program, somewhere in a warm climate.  Just openly laugh at us.  I'm pretty tired of the snow.  Pretty tired of it.  Well, March goes in like a lion. 
[00:43:30]  It sure has come in like a lion, guys.  Uh-huh.  What?  Like a lamb.  It'll go out like a lamb, right?  Yeah, sure.  At least I have heat.  How's your heat problem?  Ah, finally fixed yesterday.  Yeah, I get home and, uh, I haven't been home since we left for L.A.  L.A.  I, uh, I stayed in town.  Do we even have homes at this point?  Don't you have homes?  We're pretty much, uh, hitting the road every other week now.  I mean, we did Washington, New Orleans, and Los Angeles all in February.  We already are, uh, planning another trip to Washington, I think, next week. 
[00:44:00]  We're needed in Washington.  Yeah, we're going down there next week for a few days to do the show.  I haven't been home in years, it feels like.  Hmm.  On the road, across the...  Yeah, on the road.  All the time.  So I stayed in town, uh, yesterday.  And then, uh, went home yesterday after the show.  No heat.  No heat in the house.  It was freezing.  I, I, I called the, uh, the heat guy.  And they said, all right, we'll be there in one or four hours. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, great.  So I sat around in, you know, the ridiculous winter coat I own?  Mm-hmm.  And where I bundle up, I'm an Eskimo walking to my, uh, truck.  Your coat is ridiculous, by the way.  It's ridiculous.  I could climb Everest with it.  It's a coat they wear in, like, Buffalo, New York, and, uh, Canada.  Yeah.  And, uh, possibly Alaska.  Yep.  It is.  It is ridiculous.  It's like a sub-zero coat.  The hood comes up, the thing zips up, I got a scarf on, I'm completely encased in this thing. 
[00:45:00]  And that's what I wore for four hours in my living room, sitting there on the computer.  Playing poker.  Playing, uh, a little poker, checking the news out, sure.  Just, you know, trolling around on the computer.  And then I have tile on the floor, so when I put my feet down, I noticed my toes, starting  at the smaller toe and working its way toward the big toe, were slowly just going numb.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  There's two gone.  All right.  Three gone.  Because the floor was really freezing, because it's tile.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  And, uh, and then, I don't know who was fixing the heat, but at one point, I hear this muffled  boom!  And I open up the garage, because that's where he is.  It's full of smoke, and he goes, just shut that door.  Shut that door.  I'm like, fuck, great.  Great.  There's soot everywhere.  I'm like, I don't know what this guy's doing.  But, yeah, after a couple of hours, he fixed it up, and, uh, voila, heat.  But the heat didn't come on for so late.  And I guarantee you cranked your thermostat up to, like, 90, 95.  I did.  It's burning oil like crazy in there now.  Half your oil's probably gone already. 
[00:46:00]  Half the oil's gone.  Trying to get the cold out of the tiles, yeah.  And then, uh, we go to bed, and it was just getting into a freezing cold bed.  Yeah, because the sheets.  It's so worth.  Dude, you gotta learn when, you know, because I turn off all my heat when I hit the road.  You gotta, like, you gotta throw all those blankets on the floor or whatever when you  turn the heat back on to warm up the bed a bit.  Yeah, the mattress itself was cold.  You know, what are you gonna do about that?  You're not gonna do anything.  You're gonna get in, curl up into a ball, and just, uh, wait for it to get warm. 
[00:46:30]  Was it a, uh, three-dog night?  Oh, yeah.  Three-dog, bring the sled dogs into bed with you, because it's cold.  That's where the name of the band came from, because it was really cold, and...  Got a little BAB trivia when you used to hear that song?  Nah, nah, nah.  Hey, by the way, in the old days, people would sleep with their dogs and stuff to keep them warm,  and if it was a three-dog night, that meant it was a really, really cold night.  Right.  And that's, uh, and then that's...  The name of the band came from that little, old, old band. 
[00:47:00]  You know, it's funny you say that, because this is the part of the Opie and Anthony show  that I think is so interesting, is how we don't all agree, I prefer it chillier in my bedroom.  Well, that's a little silly of you.  Yeah, you know, it's just, I like to snuggle up, I like it nice and cold, I have the vent  blowing, even in the winter.  Has to be on.  You know, that's crazy.  When it's, when it's cold in your room and you're under the blanket, that's fine,  because then you're warm and it's cold outside.  But, but you've got to get out of that bed at some point.  Oh, it's awful.  And to get out into cold air is the worst.  Oh.  It's awful. 
[00:47:30]  If you think about it, it's really ridiculous how we think, though.  Because in the summer, you crank the A.C. and get your, the house temperature down to  what, 60 degrees, 55 degrees?  Yeah, it's got to be cold.  But in the winter, you're like, fuck that, man.  I want my room up to 75 degrees.  What's with the heat?  How does that make sense?  I never thought about that until just now.  In the, it's on the same thing in my, in my car.  In the summer, you could, you could hang meat in the, in my truck.  Right.  I have the air conditioner blasting.  The temperature, as low as it goes, the, the, the numbers on my little thermostat are 
[00:48:00]  the deepest, darkest blue you could possibly make it.  And then in the, in the winter, it's an oven.  I crank it up and, you know, make it all hot.  Really fast.  You know that, I'm having this battle with my neighbors upstairs.  The battle, the noise battle.  Well, just because they have a wood floor and they have a dog or a cat or something.  And they like to roll toys across the wood floor and the dog or the cat, this is what  you hear all night.  And then as it runs back to its owner with the ball, it's just a nightmare. 
[00:48:30]  And I, I, I've been talking about this off and on for the last couple of months.  I pound on the ceiling.  When I leave the apartment, if they don't feel like listening to me, I'll, I'll ring their  buzzer at 430, 445 in the morning to teach them a little lesson.  Well, now I feel guilty because I didn't turn off my alarm clock.  Did that happen?  Oh no, you were in New York.  Nevermind.  Uh oh.  No, Eric was acknowledging it.  Like it happened to him too.  I forgot to turn off my alarm clock. 
[00:49:00]  So every morning for the last five or six days while we're in LA, my alarm clock is going  off at like the four in the morning.  When does it stop?  I don't know.  It does stop eventually.  It does?  Yeah.  I don't know when though.  I think it, I think it might go about an hour before it finally like automatically shuts  off.  But every day while we're in LA, I don't even want to see them because now I have no excuse.  I was, I was expecting big notes on my door or maybe, you know, maybe the whole door,  you know, broken into because someone's dead in my apartment. 
[00:49:30]  If you're battling, that's a good one.  Because they're not answering the, you know, because I wasn't, you know, turning off my alarm  clock, but for the five, six days we were gone, every morning at 4 a.m. my alarm clock  was going off for at least an hour.  How'd you know?  Huh?  How'd you find out that it was going off?  Because I, when I got back into the apartment, I'm like, oh, because it was something that  hit me when, when I was flying, like, did I turn off my alarm?  And sure enough, no.  Wait, you walked in your apartment and it was going off?  No, no, no, no.  So I know it automatically shuts off somehow, but every morning it was definitely going off  at, you know, about four in the morning. 
[00:50:00]  I unplug mine now when we go away because I had the exact same thing happen.  And I was on the road and you were open with me when I bought this Bose alarm clock and  I overslept one day.  And this thing, it's like having the who in your living room at five o'clock in the morning.  It is awful.  And I put in Blizzard of Oz.  I wake up to, I don't know, every morning.  And I'm, I'm, I'm always wake up and it starts to get louder and louder.  And I actually will run into the living room at 10 after five to shut it off because it's  so embarrassing.  I got a phone call from my uncle.  I told you.  Dude, it's loud.  I told you because we were like, uh, me, uh, Jimmy and Bob Kelly were looking at alarm clocks 
[00:50:30]  for him and, and he's like, if you think this one will work, I'm like, trust  me, I got it.  It's the one that, uh, super agent Bob Eatman, uh, got us on Christmas.  I'm like, trust me, this will do the job.  So it's in my living room.  This way I have to get out of bed and go shut it off instead of just hitting snooze.  And I got a panicked call on my machine one time from Teddy, my doorman.  Uh, Jim, uh, the people are complaining loud music from your apartment.  Cause I have no, I have no rugs or anything.  So it was just Ozzy at five o'clock in the morning for God knows how long.  And I'm very happy it happened. 
[00:51:00]  Awful neighbor.  Neighbors have dogs and children, so fuck them.  Listen to that.  Awful neighbor.  All right.  Should we get into the Ramona, uh, the Ramon promos?  Where's Steve?  Ramon.  Let's get Martini Steve in here.  You know, this sucks because, uh, no, it's a good problem to have, but every day we, we  get, uh, new listeners tuning into the Opie and Anthony program.  Very exciting to see the numbers going up every day.  Yes, yes.  But starting April 2nd, even that's not even going to matter to us anymore.  We don't have to keep track of how many people are signing up for the premium channel  because the premium channel goes away October, uh, why, uh, why do I keep saying October? 
[00:51:30]  I'll tell you why.  April 2nd, April 2nd.  Because October was such a big day for us for a long time.  We were kind of talking about that, so we're going to go back on.  You know what I mean?  I think that, that's probably why it's probably stuck in your head as far as a date to look  forward to is.  Well, I think it's, I think it's the Tylenol PMs, uh, still working its way out of my body.  Don't break it off.  Don't be shy.  Steve, what's going on with the Ramon promos?  What's, uh, what, the listener ones?  There are 13 new ones today.  Uh, the, the listeners have taken it upon themselves to create, uh, a whole bunch of 
[00:52:00]  promos.  And I'm sorry, I moved the mic, Eric.  Um, uh, just putting Ramon in the most outlandish situation.  That's right.  Um, yeah, and they're just coming in like, you know, some people are sending in three  at a time, some people are sending in one every couple minutes, but they're just coming  in like crazy.  They love Ramon.  Ramon.  And really fast for the new listeners, what's the whole, uh, Ramon saga about? 
[00:52:30]  Really fast.  You don't have to go into detail like you usually do, because.  Okay.  Ramon is a, um, uh, uh, uh, a central, uh, central American house boy who caters to the  whim of the, this eccentric deep voice guy who voices promos for the Opie and Anthony  show.  Very good.  There you go.  All right.  Do we have one example of a real Ramon promo?  This is Steve's creation and it's a real Ramon promo.  And then the listeners are trying to imitate what Steve does is what, what this comes down  to.  Let's go to Derek in the other room and play this for you. 
[00:53:00]  State of the union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opie and Anthony show on XM.  Oh, who goes the weasel?  Ramon, give me your sleeve.  So there you go.  Big voice guy taking a break, taking a dump.  Right.  In between cutting promos for the Opie and Anthony show, reading the paper. 
[00:53:30]  And Ramon has to stand right next to him just in case, I guess.  Right.  Just in case.  Because, you know, uh, uh, public restroom toilet paper is, is coarse.  And it's, it's, it's not that soft.  And Ramon wears, you know, you know, nice clothing.  You know, he, you know, it's not necessarily designer, but it is made of soft cloth.  The guy takes care of him.  Right.  Exactly.  So instead of just asking for Ramon's entire shirt, he would actually wipe his ass while  Ramon was still wearing it?  Correct.  Yeah.  You're a sick F.  All right.  Well, so now the listeners are trying to imitate that style that Steve has come up with. 
[00:54:00]  And the first one is by P. Niggity.  P. Niggity?  P. Niggity.  All right.  It's called The Caddy.  Ah, there's nothing quite like a round of golf after cutting promos all day for Opie and  Anthony.  Ramon, get me a six iron.  Ramon, wipe my shaft. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I get it.  His golf club is wet because it's raining.  Anyone else notice the outside noises go away because I think he only has like one or two  tracks in the recording studio?  Exactly.  Bouncing between two tape recorders. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, some of the recorders, you can't, obviously you can't really criticize the production  value, but you have to listen to the content.  And everybody is aiming for this ambiguously gay angle, it seems.  This just, yeah, I wonder why.  I wonder where that started from.  Yeah.  Open your mouth with the cigar ashes.  You know, I'll clean this shit in my shoes.  Help me out, Ramon.  I'll crack with your sleeve.  I don't know why there'd be a homoerotic vibe to the listeners.  They really are.  It's cruel.  It's cruel.  I don't think that's gay.  It's mean.  It's demeaning.  It's condescending, but it's not gay. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  If you're taking a dump and your houseboy is standing right there, there's a homoerotic  power trip.  Oh, right.  Stand with me as I take it.  Is that, okay.  I think so, yeah.  All right.  Well, let's play the next one from the fans.  It's from Jameek.  Right, Jameek?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  It's called On a Plane.  Oh.  A quiet evening.  I did have a log.  Survive on a telly. 
[00:56:00]  Ramon, coffee, tea, or me?  That could be the creepiest thing I've ever heard.  What the hell was that?  I, I, Jesus.  Maybe, you know, in retrospect, it probably wasn't on a plane, but it's very creepy.  On a plane?  It's like audio out of Richard Speck's cell.  It's horrible.  Wasn't that just creepy?  Yeah.  Ramon's laying there dead with a fire poker over his head.  Oh, horrid. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, they try to capture, you know, deep voice guy, and they all go to, they all go horribly psychotic.  Yeah, he's not, you know, Ramon.  Yeah.  He's doing like a, Ramon, Ramon, Ramon.  Did you listen to these to pick out the better ones?  Those are the better ones.  That is a good one.  You thought that was a good one?  Good in a bad way.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  I like the other one with the surround sound golf outdoor experience.  That was really nice.  Yeah.  That guy really put some production values into it. 
[00:57:00]  All right, here's Brian's attempt.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, not another one.  Dingleberry's Ramon.  Get it with the tweezers, and then prep me for my Brazilian wax.  Jesus!  See?  It's just like, I have never done anything that blatantly homosexual, and they just completely drive it off the cliff. 
[00:57:30]  But they're also not sticking to the format.  No.  Like, there's a format, an outline that must be followed.  Right.  It's deep voice guy talking.  Yeah.  Something happens to deep voice guy, then deep voice guy goes, Ramon, solution to the problem.  Exactly.  This guy's just like, what was that?  Squeezes Ramon.  Like, he's just a little, and was that the little plague?  His sound effects were taking a dump or awful.  Yeah, it was, you know, just a guy going, what was that?  Wait, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen just for the sound effects of the dump. 
[00:58:00]  Ew.  It's a water cooler.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is a water cooler.  Water cooler.  Oh, not another one.  Dingleberry's Ramon.  Get it with the tweezers, and then prep me for my Brazilian wax.  He sounds like the jerk-off in Easy Money.  Oh, the regular guy look.  It's horrible. 
[00:58:30]  It flies off for me.  Dingleberry's Ramon.  Norton and I sat at dinner, I think, one night in Los Angeles,  and deconstructed the entire Ramon promo and tried to figure out why it was funny,  and we mapped it out to exactly what you were talking about.  There is a formula.  There is an outline that must be followed.  I don't know.  That was kind of funny, though.  Oh, Ramon.  That's like the thing.  You stopped in your tracks.  Ramon.  And then whatever it is.  Task.  Not Dingleberry's Ramon. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  And then the Brazilian guy's throwing all kinds of things in there, all willy-nilly.  Ramon is a simple person.  He can't be confused with too many demeans.  It's the fans' interpretation of Ramon.  I don't like the fans' interpretation.  I like the interpretation.  I like the formula.  Ramon is a dummy.  He's a third-world idiot, and he'll put his sleeve over it and smile like that guy  and put two in before he got his head caved in.  That's how Ramon laughs, man.  All right.  Well, let's go to...  Do it for the deep voice guy. 
[00:59:30]  Let's go to the next one.  It's Ramon and the dog.  There's nothing like taking a stroll through Central Park.  So far, so good, right?  The clean air.  The peace and quiet.  Get away from me, little doggie. 
[01:00:00]  Ramon, kick this dog in the ribs.  I'll give him that one.  Ramon could possibly be asked to kick a dog in the ribs.  All right, of course.  Here's the problem I have with that promo.  Well, I'm sure you've got a problem with it.  No, it's a little too close to home.  I think it followed the formula perfectly.  Yes, it did.  But we've never heard Ramon actually do the task in Steve's promo. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, that's true.  It's just assumed that that's the next thing he's going to do.  Yeah, that's true, actually.  Oh, how about that?  Yeah, the task.  You never actually hear the execution.  Plus, that guy needed a sound effect of an actual kick.  The kick, yeah.  Also, the dog is just whining.  I like his Ramon.  Very good.  He sounded like John Wayne halfway through it.  He almost lost me.  Kick this little doggie.  Ready for the next one?  Sure.  It's Ramon and the Drill Doe. 
[01:01:00]  Feeling a little constipated.  All this voiceover work's got me bound up.  I better call my doctor.  Hello, Doc.  Ever since Opie and Anthony came on XM Satellite Radio,  I've been doing all this voiceover work for them.  And I've got a little problem.  Well, I can't seem to, you know. 
[01:01:30]  No, no.  It's not an erection problem.  I can't seem to make number two.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  You want to stick what up my ass?  Ramon, give me your Drill Doe.  Two things.  Uh, left me hanging.  I'll tell you what else the guy can't do besides take a shit.  It's edit.  It's Spielberg.  No more four-hour Ramon promos. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, that was a bit long.  And Opie, you can't say, all right, let's do the Drill Doe one and give away the...  Oh, I know, I know.  It was just the title.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah, right?  Give away the punchline.  Because then we all knew where they were going to...  Like it was going to help.  I want to go see that new movie with Bruce Willis called He's Dead Through the Whole...  Yeah, boy, that went on and on, huh?  I'll tell you one thing.  I have no doubt in my mind that we hired the right guy to do the production for our show. 
[01:02:30]  Absolutely.  That's why Steve's handing these in.  Steve is the master.  He's feeling a little insecure.  He's like, I'll show you what...  Yeah, exactly.  ...what these guys could have had.  I can't take a shit.  And my taxes are late.  Get to the point, motherfucker.  Relax.  It's just a Ramon promo.  All right, ready for the next one?  Here it is.  Terrorists here.  Iraqis there.  Ugh. 
[01:03:00]  I've been injured.  Ramon, give me your arm.  Okay.  He was injured in Iraq.  And he cut off Ramon's arm because his arm was injured?  With a chainsaw?  Ramon cut his own arm off, I think.  Ah, Ramon cut his own arm off to give to, yeah, the big voice guy.  To give to the guy.  Who's no longer doing promos for the opening Anthony show. 
[01:03:30]  He's fighting in Iraq.  I don't think that works very well.  Now, you don't need a 50-something deep voice guy fighting in Iraq.  No, why would he be there?  That's ridiculous.  Exactly.  And why is he sounding like Bela Lugosi in that promo?  Ramon.  Ooh.  Nobody gives two fucks for Ramon.  Ramon, let's shoot this fucker.  Karloff couldn't give me his sleeve. 
[01:04:00]  All right, well.  Getting ready for the next one?  This is from Bob.  I just love a nice leisurely ride on the train while listening to Opie and Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Those menacing-looking young black gentlemen are walking right towards us, Ramon.  Hey, man, you better give me five dollars right now. 
[01:04:30]  Ramon.  Call my lawyer.  Uh.  Yeah.  There is no payoff there whatsoever.  And that could have been a good one.  Yeah.  Could have been a good one, and I think he only used four gunshots, too.  Yep.  Yep.  And he said Ramon in the promo earlier.  Right.  You don't want to do that.  We know who you're with.  You don't have to say, uh, Ramon, and then Ramon.  We know who you're with.  Right.  To just be left when he's ready, Ramon. 
[01:05:00]  What's wrong, Ben?  Oh, that one's funny.  Call my lawyer.  Huh?  Wow.  That one's funny.  That's out there.  Yeah.  Wow, imagine Ramon having to get a phone and make a phone call.  Ooh, that's wild.  By the way, real fast, because Ben's in the studio, Bernie Getz is doing the news today.  Yeah.  Make sure he talks about the Hot 97 shooting.  Oh, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Someone emailed me.  It was like, did Bernie get confused to go to the wrong radio station?  All right.  What time's he coming, Ben?  Let's get right into the next one.  This is from Hollywood Nova.  Ah. 
[01:05:30]  There's nothing like taking an originally walk in the staples, mounting my favorite stallion,  and listening to the Yopi and Anthony show.  Brrrr.  What the?  It's on my shoe.  Ramon.  Lick it all.  That's horrible. 
[01:06:00]  He's ripping off Steve's shoe on.  Kind of like that, bringing the shoe in.  I liked how he had Opie and Anthony audio played in the background.  That was kind of cool.  Yeah.  And I like the Ramon.  Ramon.  Then you hear him patting the horse going, ah, Dune.  I'm not going to race him, though.  I'm going to put him out to stud.  Ramon.  Bend over.  Steve, comment?  Not crazy about that one, but I do like the fact that he put in little subtle nuances, 
[01:06:30]  like putting the low Opie and Anthony audio on the back.  That was cool.  All right.  Here's the next one from VB.  Uh-oh.  Running late for the flight.  Ramon.  Pack my shit.  What?  Yeah.  What is wrong with this guy?  What the hell is going on with that call?  Steve, explain. 
[01:07:00]  First of all, I understand what he's trying to do.  It's another homoerotic one.  I'm not, you know, it's, he's trying to, you know, do the whole gay thing, but the filter's  all wrong.  The guy sounds like he's phoning in from a UFO.  It doesn't make, it really doesn't hold up.  I don't even understand what he was.  He's running, he's a deep voice guy is obviously on, he's got to take a plane trip somewhere and  he's running late and he hasn't packed a suitcase.  So Ramon's got to pack it for him because that's what Ramon does.  Uh-huh.  And pack my shit. 
[01:07:30]  That was a short one.  Let me, let me hear that again because it's just, all right.  That's modern phone.  Uh-oh, running late for the flight.  Ramon, pack my shit.  That is horrible.  He goes from possessed, he goes from, he goes from creepy to possessed to deep voice guy  back to possessed.  It sounds like the phone message that Madeline Stowe left in 12 Monkeys. 
[01:08:00]  You know?  Merry Christmas.  It's just an awful phased, like, weird thing.  That's very creepy.  Yeah.  It's like the ring.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a careful balance.  There's a careful balance between deep voice guy and really effing creepy.  Yeah.  How do you hear that as a listener and go, all right, this is, this is good.  Yeah, I'm sending this on end.  Steve keeps it fun.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's not the least bit creepy, that voice.  But these people, Ramon, stick this knife in her vagina. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you just gave someone an idea for a promo.  That's the one I've been hoarding.  Let's go to Joe's Ramon promo.  I just love hanging with little Jimmy Norton.  The comedy clubs.  We had different ideas as to what the problem was.  She bought me Viagra.  I bought her a treadmill.  And lots and lots of chicks.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  Ramon, you can have this one. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, he almost had it.  Almost had it.  He almost had a home run.  You know, you need kind of a dramatic buildup to the Ramon line, too.  He's just like, you know, Patty says a little line, Ramon, this one's here.  You know, where's the Ramon?  It's dramatic right there.  Slight pause and then.  It's the whole bit.  Stick this pig.  Hey, when are you going to do the promo that we talked about?  Oh, it's coming.  Oh, good.  It's coming.  I know.  I can't talk about it.  Wait, is there a new Ramon promo from the master? 
[01:09:30]  Anthony just said, oh, Steve keeps some fun.  I just wanted to say, wait until you hear what Jimmy and I wrote.  Oh, goody.  I don't mean they're fun.  Oh, okay.  I mean, your voice never gets creepy.  No, no.  It's Steve's voice guy.  These guys' voices get all, like, creepy.  No, it takes, like, five or six takes to get it right, and I'm chopping it up.  It's just, you know, you've got to be pretty anal retentive about this stuff.  And these guys are really into serial killer territory.  I think we have, like, three more.  This one's from Nick.  Oh, there's nothing like getting ahead in the morning before I listen to O&A. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Are you done, honey?  Ramon, return the favor.  What?  Wait, wait.  What?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Like, now this girl needs to be... 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Wait, why would he...  Yeah, exactly.  But...  He can't be inconvenienced.  Oh, is that it?  He can't be inconvenienced by pleasuring the woman.  Right.  So he gets a Hummer and then has Ramon reciprocate, which, that's not a bad job for Ramon.  Why is that bad?  Exactly.  That's not demeaning.  Well, it might be bad if Ramon's gay, though.  And why does she sound like Tweaky from Buck Rogers?  Beady, beady, beady. 
[01:11:00]  On a side note, I hated Tweaky.  Oh, who didn't?  I hated him.  All right, well...  Horrible show that was.  All right, Anthony, sure.  Why not?  I was more of a Battlestar Galactica guy.  No, no.  You're right.  It was Buck Rogers in the 21st century or 25th.  What the hell was it?  Beady, beady, beady, beady.  Beady, beady, beady.  Oh, with that...  Wasn't it Mel Blanc's last hurrah?  What?  I think he did that voice.  Yeah.  What else did Tweaky say?  Nothing.  Tweaky stinks.  It's a horrible show. 
[01:11:30]  All right, ready for the next one?  Yes, of course.  Ah, yes.  After a long day of cutting promos for the Opie and Anthony show, nothing helps me unwind  better than a round of anal sex with a young lady of the evening at a house of ill repute.  Ramone, please put on my prophylactic.  Thank you, Ramone.  Here we go, young lady.  Hold still.  Oh, yes. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, dear.  Ramone, my prophylactic is torn.  Ramone, please leave the young lady some of my AZT.  Oh, my God.  It's a little long, but...  It's long.  There's a couple of requests in that one.  It's like Ramone, the next generation.  It's horrible. 
[01:12:30]  Edit.  Edit.  Yeah, please.  He said Ramone eight times in that promo.  Thank you, Ramone, Ramone.  Ramone, Ramone.  Ramone.  All right, well, here's the final one.  Ah, the last Ramone promo from the listeners for today.  Ah, there's nothing like a relaxing ride on the subway.  Hey, brother, can I get too fitty?  Ramone, shoot those Negroes. 
[01:13:00]  Jesus.  Yeah.  My God, man.  Wow.  Well, no, it didn't stick to the formula because the action was carried out.  Yeah, there you go.  I mean, among everything else that was wrong with that.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The listener's really coming to the table.  Well, which one do you like the best?  I need the list.  I like this one the best.  Ah. 
[01:13:30]  No.  No.  No.  They all stink.  I like this one the best.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, not another one.  Dingleberry's Ramone.  Get it with the tweezers and then prep me for my Brazilian wax. 
[01:14:00]  Nah.  I like Ramone and the dog.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that one was my favorite of the day when he kicks the dog.  Jimmy, which one did you like?  Um, Ramone, give me your sleeve.  Ah.  There's nothing like taking a stroll through Central Park.  The clean air.  The clean air.  The peace and quiet. 
[01:14:30]  Get away from me, little doggy.  Hey, little doggy.  Ramone.  Kick this dog in the ribs.  All right, Jesus.  Very good.  Did Chester make that noise, though?  I have no idea.  It's a long, long time ago.  Chester.  All right, enough.  Where are you?  All right, enough. 
[01:15:00]  Let's go to Florida and say hi to Stuart before we take a break here.  Stuart, what's up?  Yes, when Disney lost ends with Opie and Anthony, I'd like you to do shopping on Rodeo.  Ramone, measure my crotch.  Punch it out.  I didn't understand his punchline.  Mercifully.  I understood.  He said, Ramone, measure my crotch.  Oh, measure my crotch.  Okay.  I see you were buying pants on Rodeo.  Yes, I was, and the tailor was measuring me, yes.  So, all right. 
[01:15:30]  Very good.  Very nice.  Thank you, Steve.  The listeners.  What a batch of duds.  There were some funny little things in there.  The Ramone thing taking on a life of its own.  Steve.  All right, let's take, hopefully, a long break.  Okay.  Ben's giving the thumbs up.  Get away from me, little doggy.  Little doggy.  Long break.  All right, pilgrim.  Kick that dog. 
[01:16:00]  Ramone, get my saddle, wha.  Get away from me, one lung.  Ramone, get me another cancer stick, wha.  In a scourging world, wired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they put it, like, on the grill.  One man.  It's all about me, me, me. 
[01:16:30]  You challenge the status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it.  Like, I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  With a platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness.  A revolution.  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you. 
[01:17:00]  Are you kidding?  XM 202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Call her a bitch.  Just a kiss on the lips.  Said I was on my knees.  I'm waiting.  Get me.  Call her a bitch.  She was shaking her hips.  Cause I was all that I needed.  All right, a very busy show today. 
[01:17:30]  Bernie Getz going through security as we speak.  Which means he'll be on the show by 8.30.  Bernie Getz is going to do the news today.  Can't wait for that.  That should be very, very exciting.  Billy Burr is coming in.  Very funny guy.  He's on the Chappelle Show.  He was in with the guys only, what, a week ago?  Yes.  And he's coming in to do some solo stuff with us today.  That's just white people today.  Just white people today, yeah.  Just white people on the show today. 
[01:18:00]  And we announced it earlier, but big news for the OPN Anthony program.  We're going to be off the premium channel.  We're going to be available to the entire XM platform starting April 2nd.  Out of solitary into the general pop.  That's it.  And there's all sorts of details about this move.  And I think you could just go on the website and figure out how it affects you, okay?  I think you could be locked into a certain price now.  Right.  I don't know.  Oh, they've got to figure it out that if you, I think you buy, what, 20, 30 years worth, it only works out to like six cents total. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  So, yeah, one of those things.  Look into it yourself.  Yeah, because we can't be bothered.  We just know it's great news for the program.  We'll be exposed to a lot more people.  We've got to do these Ramon promos now, though, because they won't be allowed on the Once We're Off Premium.  There'll be no more Ramon promos.  Shh.  Don't tell them that.  There's like a homoerotic vibe to it.  There's a lot of things we can't do anymore on Once We're Off Premium.  We've got to tame the show down, but we don't want everybody finding out.  And we're only allowed to curse once a week, I heard.  Yeah, but now we can't play a lot of those old songs anymore. 
[01:19:00]  Ah, man.  Is it true we have to put in a curse request if we want to curse?  Yes, if you email it.  Because there's only one a day, so each one of us has to decide.  Yeah, lawyer lady will decide how many curses a day.  Yeah.  She'll give us the total soon.  No, actually, what Logan said, I don't know if I should be saying this, is that all Ramon promos somehow have to revolve around XM functions.  Right, right.  To kind of cross the road.  All right.  A lot of snow in the Northeast, Anthony.  That's right, old pig. 
[01:19:30]  All the way from North Carolina, all the way up to Maine, I'm assuming.  Did Maine get hit, too?  I know Boston got hit.  It was another Nor'easter.  Another Nor'easter.  The news crews went absolutely nuts.  And I'm sure in your fine little town, you saw the snow reporter out there reporting on how it was going to affect your commute in the morning.  Oy vey, look at this snow.  That's my neighborhood.  I wasn't a newscaster.  It was just the guy that lives across the street from me.  Where are the plows? 
[01:20:00]  You chose to live with the Jews.  I know.  I like it.  It's crime-free.  Crime-free areas.  You never see Jews with the stocking caps over their head.  Break the window.  We'll steal the television.  Nothing like that.  No, they just say things like, sign here.  Which is a lot worse.  Who are you kidding?  Oh, I'm vital to the... 
[01:20:30]  I'm essential to the war effort.  I stink.  I'm essential to the war effort.  Anyway, Anthony, we had an assault on the media last night in Philly.  Harmer Cash from Whackbag.com did the show proud last night, Anthony.  Yes.  The guy's an animal.  He was an animal.  They had this reporter.  She was out on the street.  You've seen this scene a million times, you know, talking about the snow coming down.  The weather.  Because we all don't know what snow's about, so we need to be informed. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  We need to be informed that the roads might be a little slippery.  We need to be informed that it's going to take a little longer to get home.  We need to be informed that there may be some black ice out there.  We need to be told that perhaps this snow, if the earth just stops spinning,  this snow could last for days and pile up into feet.  But there's only three inches on the ground now.  Right.  They love trying to perpetuate the storm.  Yeah, it's moving out of our area.  But is another storm moving in to take its place? 
[01:21:30]  We'll tell you at 11.  Will it wrap back around?  Yeah.  We'll let you know at 10 o'clock.  Some of our weather models have this storm coming back around to our area,  which could increase the amount we...  No, it's not.  It's stopped.  It's over.  And then they go to the neighborhoods that have, like, water,  like ponds and lakes and rivers,  and they have to let you know that, you know, the water might get a little high.  Right.  These people already know all that crap. 
[01:22:00]  They live in the area.  They're aware, and most of them prepare accordingly.  Opie, we just got mentioned on the WB11 news in New York.  XM Radio raising their rates and offering talk channel,  offering more channels.  And they mentioned the shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony were one of the channels that will now be included.  Yeah, we're going to be all over the news today.  Ooh, shock jock.  We don't have audio of that?  Maybe we will.  You never know. 
[01:22:30]  So, anyway, this reporter was out in Philly doing exactly what we just described,  and all of a sudden Hummer Cash comes running into the frame with an Opie and Anthony.  I don't know what it was because it didn't really get on TV.  I mean, you could see really fast Opie and Anthony, I think.  The video's up on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, the camera guy was pretty sly with it.  He did not want that on camera.  He was well prepared, and opiananthony.com has the video as well.  But, basically, you see someone running in front of her with this sign. 
[01:23:00]  I think you kind of make out the XM real fast.  Yeah.  But clear as day, he's yelling, Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  The camera guy just pans down to the snow because he doesn't want the sign on the live newscast.  The reporter, they go back to her.  She's just disgusted.  Pissed.  And then I heard, and I don't know if we have audio of this yet.  After the commercial, they came back, and they had to tell their viewing audience that the reporter was okay 
[01:23:30]  because they were getting a lot of phone calls from viewers.  Like, what the hell did we just see?  She all right?  And it turns out that the reporter is six months pregnant.  So, everyone was very concerned for her safety.  Good one, you freaking idiot.  But he didn't touch the reporter.  He was just getting on camera.  God, would that have been great.  Wait, here's Hummer Cash, the one that did this particular assault on the media.  That little splash into the snow.  Hummer Cash. 
[01:24:00]  Somebody dropped a wet meatloaf into the snow.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Are you insane?  Are you insane?  Oh, man.  He was not a very happy person.  Yeah, Hummer Cash, walk us through this because a lot of people out there just don't know how to do an assault on the media.  All right.  Well, I was going to get some Starbucks and saw the news vans.  I ran home, got my WOW sticker and sign, and set up a relay guy and a guy to record it, which are two key elements of this. 
[01:24:30]  And I just kind of hung around in the cold for about 40 minutes, freezing my ass off.  And finally, they went out there, and I slowly approached, kind of just, I don't know, telling them that I was just hanging around waiting for my ride so they weren't suspicious and stuff like that.  And they eventually went live, and I just slowly walked in front of them, threw the WOW sign up in front of it and yelled and walked away. 
[01:25:00]  And the camera guy seemed to deflect the camera.  Yeah, as soon as I stepped into the shot, he panned down, and I just tried to follow it with the sign, but wasn't very successful with that.  No, but it was a very good assault on the media.  And then she got really pissed off, you could tell, when they went back to her.  And I guess they had to cut the whole shot short, right? 
[01:25:30]  Really?  They didn't need it?  They cut the feed?  They pretty much cut the feed, and then what, she started yelling at you afterwards?  Yeah, she was like, you're a real fucking asshole, you know that?  She was cursing at you?  The what?  She was cursing at you?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Nice.  Pregnant woman cursing at you.  And I just walked away, and I said, thank you, and walked back to my house.  And is it true that after the commercial, they came back to tell everyone that she's okay?  Yeah, she's pregnant.  She's pregnant, so they had to go back on air after the commercial and say, hey, look. 
[01:26:00]  She wasn't hurt, everything's okay?  Yeah, we're going to hopefully get video of that up on Foundry in the next day or so.  Someone has the audio of that?  The audio and the video.  Oh, all right.  Well, this is a developing story, Anthony.  How great would that have been if she just grabbed her stomach like Adrian and Rocky, too?  I felt a face version of the birdseed.  Hummer Cash, great job.  Thank you.  There he goes, Hummer Cash.  See you, man.  Whackbag.com, a great Opie and Anthony message board. 
[01:26:30]  Let's not forget about OpieAnthony.net as well, another great message board.  These assaults on the media really helped the show.  Oh, sure.  We just don't want you hurting anybody.  Yeah.  Don't hassle anyone.  Like you kicked her in the stomach.  Yeah, we had one that went horribly wrong when someone slipped on the ice and knocked down the reporter live on TV.  That's still my favorite, though.  It was a little icy, the sidewalk.  It's my favorite because it was an accident, but it was damn funny.  Really funny. 
[01:27:00]  And, you know, some people get confused with the assault on the media.  If there's not a satellite truck nearby, a lot of these guys are just taping.  Yeah.  And they'll never use it.  You know, the key is to know that they're going live.  They're going live.  Going live.  That's when you've got to hit them.  And, you know, we like having fun with, you know, alternate signs and stuff,  but just make sure you get Opie and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio mentioned on the live feeds.  Yes, Anthony.  I'm just reading instant feedback.  Like, funny, they don't report viewers' concerns when an employee forces someone six months pregnant to work out in the snow. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, that seems a little odd.  They throw her out there six months pregnant in a winter snowstorm.  If they were so concerned about her, why are they sending her out to do that story?  How big is it after six months?  Huh?  How big is the thing after six months?  You're showing.  You've got a good little bunt there after six months, I think.  You're definitely rocking at that point.  When's the baby do?  So, Anthony, here's finally the audio of what happened down there in Philly.  All right, thanks to Hummercash.  Karen Scullin is live in Chestnut Hill in that neighborhood of Philadelphia. 
[01:28:00]  Karen.  Hi there.  Well, we're not just talking the side streets anymore here in Chestnut Hill like the one you see over there.  Germantown Avenue.  Excuse me.  Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony.  What a tool.  I love it.  You're the reporter.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm working here.  Opie and Anthony.  XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony.  XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:28:30]  Kerplunk.  Yeah.  A little buffalo-ing with two eyes in it.  Where is the splat?  I've got to hear that again, man.  Water breaks.  It freezes before it hits the ground.  Oh, man.  That is really funny.  Yeah.  The video's pretty good, too.  So, foundrymusic.com and opieandanthony.com.  But here's the audio again.  Karen Scullin is live in Chestnut Hill in that neighborhood of Philadelphia.  Karen.  Hi there.  Well, we're not just talking the side streets anymore here in Chestnut Hill like the one 
[01:29:00]  you see over there.  Germantown Avenue.  Excuse me.  Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off.  Some director just going, cut it, cut it, cut it.  Just cut it.  We can't have this on the air.  Cut it.  Cut it.  Oh.  That's great.  Oh, my water broke.  Oh, wow.  DJ and NJ. 
[01:29:30]  DJ.  DJ.  Yeah, DJ Mike Dee's over here in Jersey.  Listen, I got one for you guys.  Yeah.  Blizzard conditions last night, right?  They showed this awesome wreck, car on the fucking wall, all smacked up.  The reporters got the balls and say to the guy, what do you think was in the accidents  out here last night?  Oh.  Yeah.  Great, man.  They get really dumb and stupid when it snows on TV.  Oh, it was awesome.  I was like, I had to call you guys last night, but I had to wait until this morning.  My whole day, and I got to talk to you guys back on the air.  DJ Mike Dee's in effect.  Peace.  All right. 
[01:30:00]  Thank you, DJ.  Getting his little plug in.  Yeah.  Is Bernie Getz almost ready for the news?  He's reviewing some CDs he's bringing in.  He's reviewing CDs.  Why?  He's got music that he wants to play as well?  Does he have clips?  Wait, get on.  I can't hear you.  Eric, no one can hear you there.  How are you there?  That's right.  What's going on?  He's got some information on these CDs.  He won't let us hear what it is, but he's reviewing them over there.  I have complete faith in his choices, and I would play them without even any type of looking  them over first. 
[01:30:30]  Let's see.  Six months pregnant.  It's big enough to make you look fat, but not big enough to keep you afloat, is what  Mr. Torrance says.  Mr. Torrance.  Mr. Torrance.  Ben, what's going on?  First of all, Bernie doesn't like you.  He wants you tied up because he said you made fun of him last time he was here.  So he's in with Steve.  He brought, right said Fred, I'm too sexy for some reason.  And he's having Steve listen to him, make sure he doesn't skip.  So he's got all his new stories.  Is he going to play for Daryl Cabe?  I'm too sexy for these new sneakers. 
[01:31:00]  He's just yapping away like he always does.  I can't wait for him to do the news.  Can you pull that mic over there, Ben, so Bernie can sit?  Yeah.  It works when you're moving around.  It does.  We fixed it.  We fixed it.  All right.  It's cool.  Hey, did we have the audio of Chris Rock and what he said about Tim Robbins?  I think so.  And where's this picture?  That was just some AP picture that's been popping up online.  I don't think any of the papers have printed it. 
[01:31:30]  That's Tim Robbins.  We all thought he got a good laugh out of what Chris Rock said about him.  You got the clip?  Where is it?  We got the Chris Rock clip.  Excuse me.  Yeah?  All right.  Because he was laughing when he walked out on stage at the Oscars.  Yeah, Chris Rock abused Tim Robbins pretty good as he was coming out to present.  It was funny.  It was funny, and it looked like Tim Robbins had a sense of humor on TV.  He was laughing.  But someone captured a fine picture of Tim Robbins.  And I give credit to Tim Robbins.  What the hell?  He's got a smirk and a smile on his face. 
[01:32:00]  It was a little back.  This is what Chris Rock said about Tim Robbins.  Ah, that's two for the aviator.  So if Howard Hughes were here right now, he wouldn't shake hands with anybody.  When our next presenter is not dazzling us with his acting ability, he's boring us to death with his politics.  Please welcome Academy Award winner Tim Robbins.  Come on.  He walks out.  He's smiling.  Kind of looks over at Chris Rock and gives a little acknowledging nod.  And what we didn't see was what this picture shows. 
[01:32:30]  He's holding the envelope as he's walking out.  And behind the envelope, kind of in front of it, to the side of the envelope a little bit, he's flipping Chris the bird.  As he's walking on stage.  As he's walking with a big, like, grin on his face, like, hey, Chris.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Right.  I also noticed, you know, that line should have killed.  Because that's just a really good line.  It's just a polite laugh and applause.  I didn't notice until a lot of people agree with, you know, Tim Robbins.  With Tim Robbins. 
[01:33:00]  But listen again.  Ah, that's two for the aviator.  So if Howard Hughes were here right now, he wouldn't shake hands with anybody.  Joke gets funnier and funnier.  When our next presenter is not dazzling us with his acting ability, he's boring us to death with his politics.  Please welcome Academy Award winner Tim Robbins.  Come on.  Did you hear how it was, like, barely?  I'll tell you, that would have got a big laugh if you would have said it about Charlton Heston.  Or about any other known conservative.  They would have went crazy about because it's Tim Robbins taking my life.  I'm sure this picture will be up on whackbag.com and opiathony.net and the rest of the fan sites. 
[01:33:30]  But it's a great picture, though.  It really is.  He's got the old Sarandon kickler sticking up at his truck.  It looks like he's searching for the G-spot, right?  A little come-hither move.  Even the girls go nuts.  All right.  Old golf ball lies.  All right, Ant.  Should we take another break to catch up a little bit?  All righty.  Why don't we do that?  What else?  And then? 
[01:34:00]  What?  Then what?  We're coming off the premium channel.  We're coming off the premium channel?  Yes, we are.  When?  April 2nd.  April 2nd?  Yep.  Nice.  Wait, don't play that song in his dirty language.  Oh, my.  That's what you're making.  That's right.  We could play.  You know what we didn't play yesterday, if we want to continue a little longer?  What Robin Williams did on the Oscars last two nights ago.  Oh, what?  I don't remember that.  Why are you laughing? 
[01:34:30]  Pat from Hunaki remembers a part of the Rocky movie.  Yeah?  It says, Rocky was great when Adrian spontaneously aborts in the pet shop, and Butkus eats up  most of the little fella, and then uses what's left to feed Cuff and Link.  He got all the names right, too.  He got all the names right.  Very funny, Pat.  20 minutes later, he just popped in the DVD and fast-forwarded.  Yeah.  That cheater.  Robin Williams, they were going to censor. 
[01:35:00]  He actually had a really funny bit idea I know he wanted to do about making, because  they were talking about SpongeBob SquarePants being gay.  Being gay.  And he had a great line of other characters that had afflictions, and of course, ABC.  Oh, is this it?  He did it?  This is it.  No, it's not, Eric.  Eric.  Eric.  Come on, Hawk.  It sort of is, but what happened was they censored him, and that's why he walked out with the  tape on his mouth.  Yeah.  He was going to do a whole thing on, like, one of the instances was olive oil.  Olive oil was anorexia.  And the censor said, there's no way you can go out there and make light of anorexia. 
[01:35:30]  Not in front of Hollywood, chicks.  Of course not.  And then there was another line that would have killed, I forget it now, but that they didn't  allow him to do it as well.  That's what network censorship, that's exactly what we've come to.  It's not an FCC violation, but some twat in practices and standards think it's offensive.  Bravo.  I've been yelling and screaming about that for years.  Dude, that wasn't on Comedy Central.  They're awful.  Everyone's focusing on the FCC, the FCC, the FCC. 
[01:36:00]  They're not the real problem.  It's the owners of these radio stations, and it's the sponsors of these radio shows that  have a much bigger influence on what you hear on radio and TV than the government and  the FCC.  Why can't you make light of anorexia?  Of course.  It's a ridiculous affliction that, you know, you should be able to make light of it.  And the point he's making is, do people have to be explained that the point of the joke  is how ludicrous it is to assume that this sexual orientation thing is what this cartoon 
[01:36:30]  character was about?  It's just to have to explain that.  They don't care what the content of the humor is.  They don't care.  But there's just some business suit-wearing twat in human practice and standards.  They're just the worst people.  They're the absolute worst, worst people.  You know what kind of complaints we'll get?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, the letters will come in, the calls.  Please.  Could you for once stand up for the artist, you fucks?  Could you for once say, hey, it's all right if you say that. 
[01:37:00]  It's not.  Let somebody be offended.  Too bad.  All right.  Little bone-thin wrist picking up the phone to complain.  Ribs showing.  Here's something for anorexia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You hate yourself.  That's terrific.  That's right.  That's terrific.  Those creaking pony knees walking over to the phone to complain.  Your stupid, rotted-out teeth because the bile always rushes past them. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that's great.  Pony knees.  Yeah, they got them big pony knees.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  Pony knees.  All right.  Here's the story, Anthony.  My knees are fat.  And lol, Jimmy.  Eric found this online.  Robin Williams censored tonight at the Oscars.  ABC has refused to let him sing a cartoon ditty that made fun of Reverend James Dobson and his SpongeBob SquarePants criticism.  Then it refused his proposed changes.  Here's what happened. 
[01:38:00]  Overnight, Mr. Shaman and his partner, Scott Whitman, dashed off a mock expose of the dark underbelly of Cartoonland for Mr. Williams to deliver over a gospel music groove as if he were a full-throated preacher invading against other newly discovered sinners in the nation's midst.  Thank God they censored this so he didn't do that.  I see him yelling like a preacher.  But I believe here's some of the lines that you did not hear as Robin Williams was doing this the other night at the Oscars.  Pinocchio's had his nose done.  Sleeping Beauty is popping pills. 
[01:38:30]  The Three Little Pigs ain't kosher.  Betty Boop works Beverly Hills.  Huh?  Why can't you say that?  I don't know.  Maybe he scrapped the whole song, but why can't you say that?  The producer of the Oscars telecast, Gil Cates, urged Mr. Shaman to make the bit less political.  Mr. Shaman said, so he quickly removed any reference to Mr. Dobson's protests and turned Mr. Williams into a fabulous, lisping character, dishing up the latest juicy gossip.  Oh, that character. 
[01:39:00]  Fred Flintstone is dyslexic.  Jessica Rabbit is really a man.  Olive Oil is really anorexic.  And Casper is in the Ku Klux Klan.  Oh, there you go.  This is what was broadcast.  Animation means to breathe life into something.  Yes.  Experts use their magic to create the image of something that is vibrant and alive.  Men know it better as Viagra.  There's Clint going, not me. 
[01:39:30]  It is the opposite of Botox.  Animated characters are becoming more and more expressive and animated and alive, unlike Joan Rivers.  And many of the women in Beverly Hills, who have that expression of constant surprise.  And you say to them, they go, what are these lumps under my eyes?  I go, those are your nipples, madam.  Also, they tell me now that Spongebob is gay. 
[01:40:00]  Square pants is not gay.  Tight pants, maybe.  Shut up!  Spongebob hot pants, you go, girl.  Shut up!  Stop it!  What about Donald Duck?  Little sailor top, no pants.  Hello?  Stop whining.  Chippendale.  Two male monkeys sharing a trunk and coveting nuts.  Hello?  Bugs Bunny in more dresses than J. Edgar Hoover at Mardi Gras. 
[01:40:30]  Hello?  J. Edgar Hoover joke.  What are we talking about?  And also part of animation is voices.  Hats bigger than Lincoln's.  Marty Scorsese plays a blowfish.  It's a good blowfish.  You know, it's a great blowfish.  Bob De Niro was a shark.  Not a big stretch.  I was good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Why?  Michael could have been Elmer Fudd.  He would have been amazing.  Be very, very quiet.  Quiet.  I'm hunting rabbit. 
[01:41:00]  Quiet.  An Elmer Fudd could have been a streetcar named Desire.  Stella.  But the guy who I want to see do a voice, I want to see Jack Nicholson as Bugs Bunny going,  Hello, doctor.  What's up?  Nice piece of tale, Trixie.  Why is that getting huge laughs?  He's killing.  All he said was Stella.  He's killing.  He doesn't do voices. 
[01:41:30]  Because you're Hollywood, you sit there and you have to laugh at Robin Williams.  It doesn't matter what comes out of this guy's mouth.  You have to laugh.  Because he's such a genius.  If you're not laughing, you're stupid.  So they sit there in that friggin' room looking at Robin Williams, looking at each other and  going, I'm laughing.  Are you?  You gotta.  You gotta laugh or you're stupid.  God, that is awful stuff.  It is not funny. 
[01:42:00]  That guy is the most consistently unfun son of a bitch ever.  The first part of it was kind of funny, and then it just died at the end when he was  trying to do voices.  He doesn't do voices.  Yeah, he has no impressions.  And then the lines obviously weren't clever.  He just said Stella, and hello doc, or whatever he said.  Agra joke, hoover in a dress.  It's just hack stuff.  It's hack stuff.  I understand, Jimmy.  You might, you know, don't burn any bridges. 
[01:42:30]  No, I actually, I like him.  I have a very strong affection for him.  I like him.  The only guy that was nice to me.  All those dumb celebrities.  Robin.  He touches on.  No, I would just call him Robin.  Rob.  If I wouldn't have to, he would go, oh, here, and hug me and take a picture.  Let me hug you.  He's nice.  He has the same manager.  Oh, is that it?  He has the same manager.  Same manager.  The same manager as Robin and Billy Crystal.  You think after Billy Crystal snubbed me for that photo, that I would have just sat on  my hands if I didn't have the same manager? 
[01:43:00]  I'd still be screaming about that every morning.  Oh, Trey.  That was a good egg.  Well, we'll play this little cartoon thing as we go to break that.  Why did ABC do that, though?  What is wrong with these practices and standards people?  If you're listening and you're one of them, please just die of cancer.  You contribute nothing.  You're not important.  Your job is meaningless. 
[01:43:30]  You're just a diaphragm.  You stop funny things from getting through.  I was going to say, it's hard enough to be funny, and then you have to worry about these  people over your shoulder.  Make it even harder to do your job as a comedian.  You want to know where they're awful?  Comedy Central.  The practices and standards people there, they're awful.  It's all the ideology you can't talk about.  We couldn't make fun of domestic violence.  Don't talk about this.  Don't talk.  And it's like, these are not FCC.  We're not giving us this cable.  But we're not even cursing.  They're making rules of their own. 
[01:44:00]  You know, you can't offend people.  That's the world we live in now.  This is fair.  You know who was great?  NBC.  They were great.  As long as it wasn't too much.  Like, they asked me to take out some kind of like a pseudo-rape reference.  I'm like, yeah, definitely.  Okay, understand that.  Didn't you, I remember you saying some kind of rape reference on NBC.  It's possible.  But like when I did the last Comic Standing set, when I went out there, just for the performance,  like after I was already out of it, they just did the three of us performing.  The guy, of course it was a guy who went over the set.  He's like, no, that's fine. 
[01:44:30]  That's fine.  That's fine.  He goes, yeah, that one might be a little bit because it's in prime time.  I'm like, no problem.  That's what standards and practices should do.  Anything that's blatantly like, ugh, take it out.  Yeah.  But no, that's not what they do.  They throw their own little ideology, their own little political views, their own little  sensibilities.  You contribute nothing.  You can't cut the mustard as an executive, and you're not gifted up to be an entertainer,  so you just stick your fucking housewife face in there and spoil everything.  You and your slip.  Wearing a slip. 
[01:45:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bernie gets us ready.  He's ready to come into the studio.  Bernie, we'll have you come in after the break.  No, no, just...  Wow, Bernie is prepared.  Bernie is very prepared to do the news for the O.P. and Anthony program.  All right, Bernie, we don't want to give you the big intro yet.  Just hold on a second.  Wait a second.  Because we're going to play this, then we're going to take a break, and then we're going  to come back with Bernie.  How does that sound?  Doesn't Bernie look exactly like he did back in the old days?  Same shirt.  You take care of yourself.  He wears the same effing shirt every time he comes in here.  You take care of yourself, though.  Well, what happens if you eat a healthy diet? 
[01:45:30]  Right, vegetarian diet.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  By the way, I brought some apples this morning.  You did.  Who the hell is going to eat an apple from Bernie Getz?  I would.  They're good ones.  It might have acid on it.  You said it's a good thing, right?  Okay?  Right?  Where's the apples?  Sure.  All right, yeah.  Go get the apples.  I'm going to play this, Anthony.  All right.  I really want to just take a break here.  Bernie, don't.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Listen to this.  I hope they're hard and crispy and not soft and pliable like KB's legs. 
[01:46:00]  The subway vigilante is back in the studio.  Atrophied apples with little shoes just hanging off them, uncuffed, unscuffed.  Not a mark on the bottom of them.  Thank you.  Oh, it's a McIntosh.  I'm allergic to apples.  Oh, I don't eat apples, Bernie.  I eat bananas.  No, Bernie, I swear to God, I'm allergic to apples.  I cannot bite into that.  Wow.  Who wants one?  The last person.  You want one?  These look like...  These are Fugees.  These are Fugees.  These look like...  Fugees.  I think they're called organic apples. 
[01:46:30]  From the deli downstairs?  Fugees.  No, these are not organic apples, but these are Fuji apples from the Korean deli downstairs in  Montana.  Fuji.  Fuji.  Are these going to be mealy?  I hate a mealy apple.  From the Korean deli downstairs?  Yes.  They have the best apples in all.  Where the hell is it?  There you go.  I feel sorry for your mother.  Including the...  Where the hell is the Korean deli?  No, no.  By Bernie's place.  Oh, by Bernie's place.  And the human race.  Yes.  I feel...  My sister said she felt sorry for everyone born in Russia in the past 300 years.  Who doesn't?  Who hasn't thought of that, like, every day? 
[01:47:00]  My heart is cold.  Yeah.  Your heart is cold as Russia.  This tastes almost like a pear apple.  It's very good.  It's got a nice flavor.  Yeah.  Well, they're sweet.  They're sweet.  The best apples I had was out somewhere in Colorado once.  Really?  They tasted like cherries.  But these are about the best apples in the world.  Maybe they were cherries, Bernie.  Yeah.  These little teeny red apples with stems in my eyes.  Yeah.  By the way, there's no real good news going on today.  No?  A little slow?  What I want to talk about is possible bombings in Iraq and then the gates in Central Park. 
[01:47:30]  That's fine.  Corny, artsy-fartsy thing called the gates?  This is a tease.  This is the news tease.  All right.  Well, whatever.  You guys, do your stuff and tell me when you want.  We've got to take a break, but when we come back, Bernie, we'll talk to you a little and then get into some news.  Okay.  Or whatever.  And then you can throw me out.  How long am I going to be here?  You are welcome as long as you want.  As long as I be here.  Yeah, we love the Bernie Getz visit.  But first this, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my balls.  Play with my balls.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  That is so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it when you...  Uh-oh.  Slow down.  Oh, my God.  Don't move. 
[01:48:30]  I'll go get you a towel.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, Opie.  Oh, my God.  I'll bring you a little...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie? 
[01:49:00]  Are you happy?  I'm happy now, Opie and Anthony Show.  M202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  In studio, Bernie Getz, the subway vigilante.  Shot four, uh, shot, uh, five poor black guys on the subway.  Five?  Four.  Four.  Oh, then that did make sense in that promo. 
[01:49:30]  Sure.  But the guy had five guys coming at that particular person.  Yeah.  And then shot four.  No, it was four guys.  He did say four in that promo?  No, I'm talking about the Ramone promo.  Oh, the Ramone promo.  Because that's what confused me before.  Never mind.  It's too complicated.  It's a group.  It doesn't matter how many there are.  What you do is, if there's a group, you get as many as you can as quickly as you can.  And, you know, he's...  To Bernie, it was one entity walking up to him.  Yeah, because they weren't, uh, human in his eyes.  Well, they... 
[01:50:00]  They were just a mass of black heading toward him.  Wait a second.  What's the most...  A big black cloud.  What is...  The most...  You know what?  The most dangerous animal on the planet walks on two legs.  Ah.  Right.  And lives above a certain street.  And lives above a hundred street, Bernie?  Jesus.  No.  I thought you meant the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  No.  No.  You didn't give me a time frame.  If the other animals could speak on the planet, you ask them what the most dangerous animal is.  Really?  Do you think...  The elephants can run...  At the sight of a person, they can run a thousand yards away. 
[01:50:30]  Many of them.  Some might not.  Don't you think, like, a big grouper would say a shark is the most dangerous?  For it and its reality.  Yeah.  So I don't think every animal would say that two-legged...  Yeah, I think a mouse.  I think a mouse is scared of a cat.  The world has land and sea.  On land.  Okay, you're right.  The sea is not our domain.  Yeah.  But on land, what is the most dangerous animal?  You think a zebra in the Serengeti thinks, yeah, man's really kicking my ass, instead of that lion that's sinking its teeth into its throat. 
[01:51:00]  The animals in nature, most of them are afraid of everything.  Well, that's true.  How about aphids?  They're afraid of ladybugs.  Really?  Yes.  Fly away home.  Ladybugs eat them.  Well, how about that?  Speaking of fear...  And girls are scared of Bernie's fingers.  Yeah, well...  And anybody's fingers.  In terms of fear, they're trying to play a fear game in Iraq.  And I want to talk about Iraq.  Hold on, Bernie.  This is the news segment.  Yeah, this is the get-to-know portion of the show. 
[01:51:30]  We like reintroducing you to our listeners every time you come in.  It's kind of nice, you know?  And I hope he gave them the big intro, that it's the subway vigilante.  You might remember back, what year?  19...  That was the very end of 84.  84.  Yeah, now I think you can change the world, not by law and order type of things, but by...  Mankind should generally become vegetarian.  Vegetarian.  You hold so much to vegetarianism. 
[01:52:00]  You believe vegetarianism is a way of not only to change your health and stuff, but actually change the world.  It will change the relationship of animals on the planet.  You have a relationship with...  Well, right now around us, there are no animals around.  Many of them would be a nuisance, but the rest would be afraid of us.  You can have a relationship with a machine, with a console, but that's not alive.  So your relationships are with other...  Real relationships can be with other people and with other animals.  Many people have better relationships with animals than people. 
[01:52:30]  But it would make the world a kinder, gentler place.  Kinder and gentler.  He's right, because over in the Middle East, they eat a lot of hummus, and they eat all pita bread, and they're very nice to each other over there.  Those savages have a stake in 14 centuries.  All they do is bomb each other.  No, no, no.  Any comment?  The Middle East imports a great deal of lamb from Australia.  Lamb.  The dreaded lamb.  Well, yes, but what they do is they grow these sheep for five years, and they're wool-bearing years. 
[01:53:00]  And at the end of their wool-bearing years, they're shipped under miserable conditions around the world.  And then, like, they might slaughter them individually in countries like that, where you buy a whole sheep or goat at one time.  Or they go to places where they make them into sausages or whatever they do.  And if we weren't doing this, it would be a better world somehow?  Definitely.  If we would treat the animals better, and we'd be healthier.  We'd feel better about ourselves.  It would save our soul.  We would have more respect for ourselves.  Ah. 
[01:53:30]  Mankind.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I kind of like an occasional burger, Bernie.  I don't know what to tell you.  Well, taste is absolutely right.  It might, for most people, they will never...  You're talking sacrifice there.  Restraint.  Yes, restraint.  But which would you rather have?  Would you rather have a world with more love in it, or would you rather have something...  Let me think.  Love, big, juicy burger.  Love, big, juicy burger.  Love is pretty...  I'm going to opt for big, juicy burger.  Me too, because you can always hold some hamburger meat and fuck it.  Okay, that's the attitude, you see.  You don't know love in the world. 
[01:54:00]  Love is a rare thing.  It should not be.  There's probably more love in the animal world than there is in a people world.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah?  You think?  Like lions with their young.  Absolutely.  They're very nurturing.  Got to be.  They'd never survive if it wasn't for their...  Bernie, you have a very dismal outlook on humanity itself.  No, I'm in a long-term...  The only thing that can change this world is mankind.  Yeah.  Suppose all the squirrels get together and they say,  we want to change the world or we want to do things differently. 
[01:54:30]  Let's do things, not even change the world.  If that happened, I would go...  Ah!  Ah!  No, no.  No, they couldn't.  That would freak me out, Bernie.  They couldn't.  If the spiders decided, if the squirrels decided, if the birds, the fish,  nothing would happen.  There's only one creature.  There's only...  You know, like the Bible says, we have dominion.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, are we ready for the news, Anthony?  I'm thinking your outlook...  You have these plans that...  Not really plans, but you have these visions that if certain things change,  the world would be a better place. 
[01:55:00]  Definitely.  But what I'm saying is your outlook with the way things are now is kind of dismal and dark.  You really don't have...  You don't have many good things to say about humanity and humans now.  No, no.  Mankind's civilization is a wonderful thing.  The technology, the power we have is an incredible thing.  How that power is directed.  Mankind and what you'd call, quote, civilization, it's a little bit...  It's almost like a tidal wave.  You know, it's really lacking direction.  And I think mankind should be more like the River Nile, doing, you know, flowing in and out, 
[01:55:30]  doing things, making the world a better...  Mankind could make the world a much better place.  And in some ways, mankind...  Well, mankind's made a much better world for itself, so far.  Well, you connect vegetarianism to being kind of peaceful.  I want to ask you about...  Vegetarianism is peaceful, but a lot of people have been saying that, like,  if people are going to be vegetarians, well, then, you know,  I mean, that's just what's going to be, like, you know, the way it is, you know.  Well, no, mankind needs a heart. 
[01:56:00]  People don't even, like, in terms of, you know, in terms of having a heart.  We don't...  The world works on mechanics and money a lot.  Yeah.  You know, and that's one thing, but...  And it should try to do that well, but what it does with that power...  All right.  ...is important.  Very good.  All right.  Very good.  Are we ready for the news with Bernie Guest?  Absolutely.  Good for the...  We're ready for the news.  All right, Bernie, let me...  News?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me get you a little teletype here. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, look at that.  And now with the news, the subway vigilante.  Bernie Guest.  Okay.  Bernie.  Too loud to you.  Yeah, that is really loud.  What's loud, Bernie?  Hey, wait a second.  Could you turn that racket off?  Yeah.  That sounds like a broken machine.  Doesn't it?  I don't want to talk over that thing.  Just get rid of it.  We got...  Oh.  No.  Oh.  We can talk about things in the news that are important.  Things that affect our lives now.  But you've got to do it in a format of a newscast like you would see on TV or hear on the radio, 
[01:57:00]  Bernie.  I'm going to talk about news stories like some people talk about on the radio.  And I'm going to talk about the gates in Central Park and then first about Iraq.  All right.  Let's go.  Because in terms of what's on the news right now, in terms of all the papers, not much  is happening.  There's almost no news.  All right.  So for my news sources, I bought the Inquirer and the Weekly World News.  Weekly World News.  Absolutely.  And those great stories will have to come later.  That boy.  First, we're going to talk about Iraq. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Bernie gets with the news, Anthony.  All right.  The subway vigilante.  Now...  Oh, wait a second.  That's too much.  I can't...  I can't deal...  Opie, I can't deal with it.  Wait.  Wait.  You're freaking him out.  Exactly.  Right.  What happened?  Well, okay.  Now, if you...  Sounds like the shattering of a negro's teeth on the subway.  Make it even a little softer, Opie, and it will go on with us.  Otherwise, we're going to take a vote to have you tied to your chair.  Right.  Remember, we can do that.  And I will vote.  Always keep that in the back of your mind.  All right.  We can have you tied to your chair, and it's already been arranged. 
[01:58:00]  If you keep on messing...  He's asking for trouble.  I think you're screwed up, Bernie.  No, no.  Wait a second.  The security...  Just so you understand the arrangement, Opie.  I don't know if you heard about it.  Oh, Lordy, Lordy.  No.  What?  Okay.  Wait.  The security guy out there, Opie, he could...  If he wanted, he could probably kill everyone in this room in about one to one and a half minutes,  and no one would stop him.  Maybe if we could act in concert.  You know what that sound could not possibly be, Bernie?  Daryl Cabe tap dancing. 
[01:58:30]  It sounds like a broken manure spreader.  It could not be Bob Dylan singing.  You know, it could not be a lot of things.  It could not be a lot of things.  Very good.  All right.  Go ahead.  Bernie gets with the news, everyone.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Okay.  Now, here's the arrangement.  So you turn it down.  That's security guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  He could wipe anybody on the floor here.  If you act out...  All right.  All right. 
[01:59:00]  I'll tell you what.  All right.  I'll turn it down.  I'll turn it down.  All right.  And if people vote unanimously, he's going to tie you to your chair.  Right.  All right.  And everyone will laugh, and he's not going to hurt you.  All right.  I'll turn it down.  Master Poe out there.  Good.  Hey, thank you.  You're right.  Thank you.  But anyway, there's a couple things going on.  One story that, you know, people always see in the papers lately is about bombings in  Iraq.  There's a political campaign.  And by the way, that political campaign, the people who are doing it, what the so-called  insurgents, they're losing.  It's a public disaster.  Oh, really?  Oh, absolutely.  Public disaster.  People say, oh, it's a terrible thing going on here. 
[01:59:30]  You know, people hear about it here.  But now, 20 years ago in New York, so people understand it.  In terms of numbers, like 100 people, I think, were killed yesterday.  115.  Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.  Even if the average per day.  Yeah, it's not.  It's 115 lives.  Absolutely.  But I'm going to tell you why.  Oh, hold on.  Because per year.  Let me turn this off somehow.  They don't even kill 10 per year.  10 per day.  On an average, they don't even kill 10 per day.  On an average.  Okay, but if they...  So you're saying they really got to pick it up. 
[02:00:00]  Well, no.  Oh.  Oh, you understand.  Pick it up.  They can't pick it up enough.  No.  In terms of populations, you can knock out 10% of a population.  And you only get it mad.  If they kill 10,000 a year, and let's say it's all Shiites.  There's over 10 million Shiites.  That is only one in a thousand.  In New York City, to put it in relation to crime rates in New York City.  20 years ago, in New York City, 2,500 people were murdered.  500 of them were family acquaintances. 
[02:00:30]  It could have been 2,504, but somebody didn't have...  I'm talking 4,496.  I'm talking math in a numbers game here.  I hear you, Bernie.  And dealing with beehives.  And making people angry and political failures.  If roughly four people a day to five people a day, usually five people a day, were just  murdered on the streets.  Now, you know the trouble people would have on the streets in terms of being accosted,  threatened, muggings, and that.  Sure.  Jumped on, kicked. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, right.  Five people a day were being killed on the streets in that stuff.  There was one person which was family on family.  That crime rate hasn't gone down.  The stuff about street crime has dropped 99%.  Your chance of being killed on the street is way, way down.  And with that...  Bernie's got a lot to do with that.  Nobody coming up asking for five bucks anymore.  Okay, but you see, when you have five people a day being killed on the street, that's only  about...  That's 2,000 a year. 
[02:01:30]  And that made people a little bit mad.  A little bit mad.  A little bit mad.  Not a whole bunch, because people were being completely, continually threatened.  Is this your newscast, Bernie?  Yes, it is.  Now, in Iraq, we're getting to the numbers in Iraq.  In Iraq, if they kill 10,000 a year, that's significantly more than 2,000 a year on the  streets.  Five times as many.  Five times.  8,000 more.  But you still have 999 out of 1,000 people living.  But remember, people aren't being threatened by these people continually, like they were 
[02:02:00]  in the past.  I carry the three.  No, no, no.  I was adding.  If you kill one in 1,000 people, you just make them mad.  Right.  You don't terrorize them.  That's one tenth of 1%.  Even if you kill 1%, you just make them mad.  Just make them mad.  It's like going to a beehive.  So, I understand.  You're saying the insurgents, what they're doing, it's not really effective like they would  like...  It's a political system.  And it can even be prevented.  To summarize, people die in Iraq, no big deal.  No big deal.  Well, no.  There is a solution to a great deal of this stuff.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  And that is...  Swindle.  That's in the long run.  You get bomb-proofing.  With bomb-proofing, you need barriers and cells.  Bomb-proofing.  Bomb-proofing.  Now, there's two types of bombs.  People carry bombs, and you can put bombs in cars and trucks.  If you have all waiting areas on Iraq.  You ever hear of the dreaded Munaki bomb?  It's a roadside bomb.  You can tell...  When you drive by, you hear unfunny stuff, and your car explodes.  Okay.  Now...  And a little piece of it falls off the right side.  In all waiting areas need bomb protection. 
[02:03:00]  Here's how it is simply and cheaply done.  You have barriers on the outside to the streets.  Just a barrier, a wall, so they can't get you with car bombs, truck bombs, a crowd that  is waiting.  And then, in the waiting areas, you need little cell areas where people are separated in  areas no more than 10 per an area.  It doesn't have to be a closed room, just little walls.  How do you call them up?  There can be benches.  12 come up.  Can you put them in if it's a 10 per an area?  10, 12, whatever.  You shoot the over 12. 
[02:03:30]  You have seating.  I say.  But if you separate the people, a person carrying a bomb can kill no more than 10.  Bernie, are you stealing this idea from Israel?  I saw the wall that they were building on the side of the road in Israel.  If one of the things they say that these insurgents are truly worried about, that once  the Iraqi government takes power, that they will ruthlessly suppress the insurgents.  And if they use the same techniques as Israel, that's fine with me and the rest of the world.  I think so. 
[02:04:00]  But bombs can go off anywhere there, in any government waiting area, in police waiting  areas, if people are applying for jobs, and in churches.  They may have to have in front of their churches.  What about B-52s full of soy milk that can strafe the crowd, raining wonderful soy milk  on them, and they'll be all peaceful.  That's the right message.  I don't think that we should have commerce in meat, live animals or meat between nations. 
[02:04:30]  No?  You don't even know the rules.  No.  You shouldn't be able to trade in meat.  I think it's bad.  You don't know the background.  You get the mad cow disease, right?  Well, yeah.  What do you think of the mad cow disease?  Pretty nasty stuff.  Well, it's not my problem.  I don't care.  You never heard of mad broccoli, right?  This is right.  You can.  If there's crud and smeary stuff on broccoli, it can make you very sad. 
[02:05:00]  But that's more perturbed.  Right, than actually mad.  So why don't we move on to the next story?  Oh, yes.  Other stories.  And this is before we get on to the...  The Weekly World News.  All right.  It's so loud.  That's fine.  That's when we had a newscast.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Put her down.  Please.  Please.  Please, Opie.  Please.  The gates in Central Park are falling down.  What, Bernie?  What?  The gates in Central Park are falling down. 
[02:05:30]  Oh.  The gates are falling down.  Yes.  The gates are falling.  Okay, now, something I normally wouldn't care for, but they had this thing, these great  big orange gates all around Central Park.  For two weeks, the past two weeks.  Really?  I guess you missed it.  Yeah.  Okay, I went there.  They should have covered that on the news or something.  Yeah.  Well, though, they did have it on the news.  And I think, generally, I wouldn't spend money on that, and I went up there, and I saw it  rather reluctantly.  I was dragged up there one day by somebody.  Cool.  I normally never go north of 23rd Street.  Wow.  That's way up north.  That's a good practice to a... 
[02:06:00]  I had a rental car for a few hours that I wasn't paying for, so we drove up here, and  we parked it, and we looked at it for an hour, and it was kind of cool.  Yeah.  And it cost $21 million, or $20 million.  To go look at it?  No, that was free.  Free.  Free.  And they're in the process of tearing it down now, and I think they should keep it up at  least a few more weeks.  Now, why, Bernie?  Because it would cost no more money to keep it up for a few weeks.  I would not have put it there, but it would be good for... 
[02:06:30]  People would like it.  I think it would be good for tourism, and an easy way to keep it up there, they've already  taken down a little bit of it, is the mayor should just ask for a delay for a few days,  and then ask the city council to vote.  Ask the city council to vote if they want to keep it a few weeks or a month.  You know it's going to take up to two weeks just to take it down, though.  Yep.  Well, what they should do is...  They're not going to take it all down today.  It's too big of a project.  There's 7,500 gates they've got to take down.  They're leaving one gate up, and people just will walk back and forth through anything.  And the weather's bad.  And I'm not saying keep it up permanently. 
[02:07:00]  I wouldn't like that.  But it would be great as a tourist attraction.  The mayor could, if it's just a mayor assay, just, well, the weather's so bad, temporarily  stop demolition for a couple days, and let the city council vote on it.  And if the city council overwhelmingly votes, yeah, let's keep it a couple more weeks, or  keep it through March.  Isn't it really Christo's whole idea, and shouldn't he have some say if his work of  art stays up longer?  Well, his agreement was to take it down.  Now, I myself, I didn't care for it that much, but I saw lots of people liked it.  It's a big game thing for adults. 
[02:07:30]  Like, you can, it's about, the space is about seven feet high, you can walk under, so adults  can walk over it.  And I think that women actually may see colors differently than people.  Really?  Relate to the world.  I think, than guys.  And like someone...  You have black and blue in the mirror when they don't listen.  There'd be less of that if there was vegetarian, more vegetarianism.  All right.  Less domestic abuse.  Less domestic abuse.  Yes.  Because they can't answer back when they're chomping on carrots. 
[02:08:00]  There'd be less bullying in the schools.  You know?  Yeah.  A lot of people have said that's not true, though.  I've gotten emails where people were saying that bullying is attributed because of vegetarianism  is a totally different issue.  No.  You would find that generally the vegetarian kids would be bullies much to a much lesser  degree than the...  Well, that makes sense.  ...than the non-vegetarians.  That's because they'd be a little slimmer, though, and geekier, maybe, than the fatter,  more robust bullies that are eating beef and protein and getting all bulked up.  They would look better. 
[02:08:30]  They would look better, but you need real soy substitutes.  Let's get back to the...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's get back.  Keep them on track.  Let's go back to the color thing.  Women see colors differently?  I think they see colors a little bit differently and can get joy out of colors and things like  that a little more differently.  It did add a lot of color to the park.  And a few cities here...  A few of the buildings around the park need a cleaning.  That became...  You know, I became aware of that.  Also, the snow, by the way, has been quite clean in New York City the past several years.  The air is cleaner. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, but no, it's the big piles of sooty snow on the side of the road.  I think you're right.  Right, right, right.  So the city is getting better.  People were willing to live in this city 20, 30 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago,  when it was grimy and the air was much dirtier.  So there's a lot to be said for the city, even though the city is colder.  It's more mechanical.  It's too...  Money ties up everything.  Now that it's become a more desirable place to live, it takes money to be almost anywhere  in this city, unfortunately. 
[02:09:30]  Well, that's just the way of the world, you know, and there's nothing we can really do  to change that.  Well, yes, there is.  Oh, I thought so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hand out carrots.  More good, that's part of that, but more good building is needed.  They need, the World Trade Center site needs to be rebuilt differently than the official  plans.  As a matter of fact, that may be, the official plans may be on the way out, maybe there'll  be better plans.  Have you heard that?  Well, there's little buzzes going around.  It's not a squirrel telling you these things, right?  Yeah, there might be things in the Wall Street Journal.  Now, if people want to see a good plan, can I plug a website, not my own? 
[02:10:00]  Absolutely.  Get a bullet.com.  Okay, I'll say it, and then I'll spell it.  Okay.  It's all words, make, N-Y, N-Y, again, dot com.  It's the word, make, M-A-K-E.  Make New York, New York, again.  Yes, but...  Oh, make, N-E-W-Y-R-K.  No, no, don't spell out New York.  Make, N-Y, N-Y, again.  Well, N-Y is New York, though, so...  That's what it stands for, but don't...  Make, N-E-W-Y-R-K.  Gag him.  Gag him. 
[02:10:30]  No.  Okay, anyway.  Make, N-Y-C, N-Y-C, again.  I'm about to see.  Hang both these guys.  N-Y, N-Y.  Oh, strangle them.  N-Y, N-Y, because he asked me for money.  Okay, yeah.  Make, N-Y, N-Y, again.  Make, space, N-Y, comma, N-Y.  And you can see the official project down there and another project.  All right.  Yeah.  And as for this bullying stuff in the school...  When is this your next news story?  And death penalty and stuff like that, I talked to a liberal girl, and she told me once about... 
[02:11:00]  She said her opinion of the general subject.  She said most of the trouble is caused by a particular sex, and it shows at an early age.  So let the women decide.  What does that mean, Bernie?  Yeah, I know what he means.  Maybe you could translate.  He knows what it means.  Yeah, we know what it means.  He knows what it means.  I'm talking about...  I don't need the 10-minute explanation.  Trust me, I know what it means.  I'm talking about...  I'm talking about...  I'm talking about what it means.  I'm talking about what it means.  Oh, come on.  It's how the Romans dealt with trouble. 
[02:11:30]  Troublemakers.  Gave them war helmets?  What?  The Romans?  The Romans.  Yeah, the Romans, the parents would kill their own kids.  Really?  But they had good ones, too.  And they loved them.  All right.  Well, anyway...  On to the next one, Bernie.  So I think it's important that we should try to keep those gates for a while.  It would cost no more money.  It would be a good, positive thing.  And because many people would like it.  Do the squirrels in the parks seem to be upset by the gates, or do they enjoy it?  It's wintertime.  The lifetime of squirrels, the small squirrels that survive in the north all live underground, 
[02:12:00]  with the exception of birds, and the squirrel is a mammal that lives in a tree.  So you will not see squirrels in the winter?  30% of them die.  Their cause of death is in the winter.  That's very sad.  It's very tough on them.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  They stay indoors.  Well, their version of indoors, which is what, underground?  What?  Squirrels?  No, in the trees.  And it gets very cold in the trees. 
[02:12:30]  Once you get about 60 inches underground, or a few feet underground, the temperature is  always about 60 degrees in the wintertime.  So the rats in the city, they don't go through what the squirrels go through.  They're a totally different lifestyle.  There's almost like a small holocaust going on in the winter.  Absolutely.  That's a lot of dead squirrels.  Absolutely.  So why do the squirrels just go underground?  What's the armor?  It makes a rack look like a picnic.  Why do they just go underground?  What's the armor?  Just the squirrels.  Because they go up in the trees.  Why?  For them, safety is the trees. 
[02:13:00]  Safety and security is the trees.  But if they're going to freeze, what I'm saying is why do they just do that?  Well, for starters, in New York, there are rats underground.  In a fight between a rat and a squirrel, the rat always kills the squirrel.  Why would they fight?  Really?  Yes.  Why would they fight?  They just, because the rats are willing to eat the squirrels.  Let's say the squirrel had a little revolver and actually fired at the rats.  Could he possibly get away?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Or rats came up and asked him for nuts?  With a revolver. 
[02:13:30]  Are the black squirrels tougher?  Right.  No, probably the most aggressive are the red squirrels.  Better dead than red squirrel.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  I hear you.  In music news, in other news...  Hold on, I got music news speakers for you.  There ain't no music news.  So you can play some music because, you know, whether, who cares if, who's, I have my booze,  is, you know, he's dating this girlfriend on the scene on the beach with a bikini.  Yeah, who cares, right?  And somebody, right, right. 
[02:14:00]  And he died of an overdose in his bathtub.  Who cares?  And who cares?  Yeah.  But in honor of these people who died last night, why don't we play some music?  Who died last night?  Some of that music we had there.  Or you want to BS someone?  Who died?  Nobody.  I don't pay any attention to that stuff.  Not the rappers and stuff, right?  You listen to rap music?  None of them.  No?  No.  Yeah, you hear what happened in Hot 97?  Nope.  Nope.  There was a shooting at the hip-hop station, Hot 97. 
[02:14:30]  So what?  So what?  So what?  It seems that there's a rivalry between a couple of rappers.  How many people died?  It sounds like a news story to me.  One guy got shot in the leg and he's in stable condition.  Wow.  Should have shot him.  Should have walked up and said, you don't look so bad.  And shot him again.  I'm more concerned about the animals that were washed out to sea by the tsunami a month ago.  The animals?  That's right.  That's not nice calling the fine people of Phuket animals. 
[02:15:00]  Look, somebody shoots somebody in the leg over an argument.  Who cares?  Who cares?  I got the weekly world news.  It was the bodyguard of 50 Cent, though.  You know who 50 Cent is?  Nope.  He's a rapper.  I can make two telephone calls with him.  With 50 Cent.  Right.  This is him playing right now.  You like this?  I think in this, all this music, the black music has become lost in the past 20 years  or so.  It used to be melodical about love.  Blacks were known for good music. 
[02:15:30]  This is all like aggression music about, you know, tough music.  Right.  I got my .45 loaded, my Uzi here, you know, and all that kind of BS.  Bernie Ratt.  No, that's BS.  You know what this song needs?  No.  No.  Gunfire.  You want to play some decent music?  Play a cut of that stuff that I brought here.  Why don't you play one of those cuts?  It's a totally different thing.  I honestly don't have...  Oh, yeah, wait a second.  No, no, you got to put it right here. 
[02:16:00]  It's right by you.  Put it in the thing.  All right, give me your music.  Yeah, that's the music.  Oh, you brought in music?  You burned it yourself?  No.  That's an old thing.  It shouldn't skip.  Just play a cut one of them.  The house next door got ball?  A minute.  That's a minute.  Well, the house next door got...  Wait.  Do you burn discs at home at all?  CDs?  I never listen to music.  Never?  But I might start again. 
[02:16:30]  Look into that.  Music is soothing.  Yeah.  It's calming.  What is this, Bernie?  Anya?  I don't know.  This is a minute and a half.  A minute and a half.  Just be quiet.  Just be quiet?  Yeah, why not?  You want us just to meditate?  Be quiet, Opie.  I'm trying to hear this, Opie.  You can't talk through it.  Let's all just meditate.  I'm trying to hear this.  I'm trying to hear it.  Hey, I didn't get one from you.  I like it.  I like it. 
[02:17:00]  I like it.  When does it kick in, Bernie?  Yeah.  Does it kick in?  It's meditation music, Anthony.  Bernie makes love to scream.  This is nice music to lay on a table and be jerked off by another man to.  I don't think so.  It's soothing and calming. 
[02:17:30]  Bernie shoots.  You know what?  All right.  Here it comes now.  Wow.  We're almost done with our meditation session with Bernie Jets.  Bernie, what is this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He says, I don't know.  It is relaxing.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  This is where you like lay on the bed and kind of picture yourself on a beach.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  You can.  And if you're lying on a beach stone, you've got to watch out because you can just get so  into it being warm, you can get sunburned pretty crisp.  Really?  You can't lie on the sun for an hour.  Especially if you put oil on you and you don't turn over and you spend too much time in the  sun.  It would certainly be a problem if you're fair-skinned because I'm fair-skinned.  Yeah.  I'm known to burn.  The good idea is to smear yourself up over that lotion.  I'm Irish.  Irish people always burn very easily.  Just sitting in the sun is real mellow.  You want to keep yourself as white as possible. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Especially if you're living in New York City.  Right, Bernie?  No.  And then also jumping in the ocean of salt water really cleans you out.  It cleans the outside.  It doesn't clean your inside.  Thank you, Captain.  I'm going to get drank.  You're very, very good.  For the inside, you've got to go vegetarian.  As Bernie gets his next news story together, Anthony, I think he's doing the news.  I don't know.  Here's another selection that Bernie brought in today.  Oh, you brought another song in, Bernie?  All right.  No, not that.  Hey, that's the wrong one.  Pick it.  Pick it, Anthony.  What's this?  You've got the wrong one.  I can't.  I've used out the board.  It says track two, Bernie. 
[02:19:00]  No, no, no.  No, stop.  Kick it.  Kick it.  That was track two on that other song.  Betty Davis Size.  Plays Betty Davis Size by Kim Collins.  I don't know where your music is.  Oh, the house next door you've got somewhere, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, I didn't get that.  Here's the next selection for Bernie Gats.  Yeah.  Everyone do the clap thing.  Not yet, Opie.  Everyone, now.  Her hair is hot on the go.  Oh.  Let's sweet surprise. 
[02:19:30]  Her hands are never cold.  She's got Darryl K.B. legs.  She's got a music party.  Dangling like turnip roots.  She's got New York snow.  She got better day inside.  That was awful.  She's dragging her lazily along the floor.  She's going to eat you.  Oh.  She's going to eat you.  Wow.  I'll be there to just please you. 
[02:20:00]  She's got kosher.  I'm going to use the men's room.  I'm going to be right back.  Oh.  You're right, Bernie.  Wait, Bernie, what happened?  I just need to go wee-wee.  I'll be back in about a minute and a half.  You're not going to ditch us, are you?  No, I'm coming right back.  The song will take that long to play.  You're not hiding a gun in there, are you?  No, no.  Behind it.  If the song doesn't, if the song, if I'm not back before the song plays,  play Keep on Rockin' in the Free World.  Yeah.  How are you going to be?  You're not going to come back like Michael Corleone, are you? 
[02:20:30]  Let me run.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Finish my bagel.  All right.  Could someone fall into the bathroom?  I don't trust him going to the bathroom at this point.  Do you mind if me and Bernie speak kook?  Mucho vegetarianism.  Mi padre soy milk.  Yeah, bring Billy in here, I guess.  You think too much of me, kid. 
[02:21:00]  I'm the garden burger eater.  No, have Billy just sitting in the bathroom.  Four shots and he doesn't look so bad.  Hey, what's up, man?  Two shots and his feet still move.  You can sit here.  No, we don't sit in there until Bernie gets freaked out when he comes back.  Why?  Then we'll move.  You don't want to freak Bernie out.  Then we'll move over there.  You don't want to freak Bernie out.  I don't want to freak Bernie out.  All right, sit over there, Billy.  Remember last time Bernie was freaked out?  Jesus Christ.  Have another. 
[02:21:30]  Billy, you know who this guy is?  Have another, yeah.  Yeah, that was his classic line.  Here's the guy.  Have another.  You don't look so bad.  Have another, yeah.  He is something else, man.  You got it.  You got it.  I like what he was saying about the meat, though.  Who doesn't?  Write it down.  You know what I mean?  No trade in meat.  This whole meat trade.  I like dollars and euros myself.  I don't like the idea of having to go in with a steak to get a coat.  You know, that whole meat trading thing.  Way overrated.  He is a great, great guest, Bernie Getzel.  He just comes in and babbles. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah?  You're going to freak him out sitting in that seat?  I just sat down out of habit.  Yeah, sit down, Hawk.  Good luck to you.  How long does it take him to go to the bathroom?  He must wash his hands like a madman.  I bet he's one of those.  He's just scrubbing.  Hey, Bernie.  Oh, sorry, Travis.  Yeah, he must wash his hands like crazy.  Removes old body hair.  Bernie's got all sorts of things going on, man.  I like to wash my hands in soy milk. 
[02:22:30]  Then I use soap.  Then, again, soy milk.  And then some vanilla.  And then I spread broccoli on myself because it's healthier for the outside.  Billy, wait until we talk about his squirrel.  Yeah, what was going on?  He has a squirrel that he loves.  And the squirrel talks back to him.  Yeah.  That's just like Son of Sam, but kind of cute.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the Christmas special, Son of Sam.  The squirrel told him to tap on windows and wave at couples.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, he's something, man.  Four guys.  Should we just take a break?  Why?  Do you think when he gets back?  What happened?  We don't want to hear Betty Davis' eyes.  That's a great song.  Where's the one here comes?  Here comes Bernie.  Uh-oh.  So, hey, Bernie.  You can just shoot him.  Bernie, take a seat.  Eric, don't sit down there. 
[02:23:30]  Where Bernie's sitting?  That's okay.  I don't care.  Why not ask him for five bucks while you're at it, Eric?  Jesus.  I need it more than him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How are you doing financially, Bernie?  You all right?  Okay, I can pay the bills.  You can pay the bills?  That's the main thing.  Nothing on the verge of being shut off or anything, right?  You're organizing, paying your bills and stuff?  I don't keep track of money.  I mean, if I've, you know, the main thing is you have a little money in the bank.  You know, you always need some little money in the bank.  But you've got to pay your bills and stuff.  Of course.  Sure, sure.  So, you know, you keep your electric on and your phone on and stuff like that. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I just want to make sure you're taking care of yourself, you know.  I want to see Bernie Getz out in the street.  Hey, Bernie, do you know.  You gave us another song to play here, I noticed.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Did you play Betty Davis?  Yeah, we played that while you were in the bathroom.  Oh, good.  Keep on rocking it in the free world.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  Come on, I hope.  Bernie gets it.  Oh, me.  It's nice.  That's really young, right?  Let's take a vote. 
[02:24:30]  Let's take a vote.  Let's take a vote.  Let's take a vote.  They claim to be wild Indian from the plains.  Okay.  This song is not appropriate.  Okay, wait a second.  Why'd you bring this in?  I didn't bring this in.  Did you say demo?  Let's take a vote.  How many people think Anthony should be tied to his chair?  Anthony?  Anthony?  Oh, sorry.  I'm fixed up.  Anthony.  Happy millionaire.  Do you think Opie should be tied to his chair?  Absolutely.  Okay, that's one.  Do you think Opie should be tied to his chair? 
[02:25:00]  Opie?  Opie?  Opie should be tied to his chair?  Yes, not gag, just tied to his chair.  Do you think Opie should be tied to his chair?  I think you should do it, Bernie.  No, no, the security guy is willing to do it.  But if we have a unanimous vote, Opie should be tied to his chair.  He can't do this stuff.  By the way, where's Opie's boss?  Who's Opie's boss?  Oh, I'm Bernie.  Bernie, Bernie.  Do you think Opie should be tied to his chair?  All right.  Nope.  You're obsessed with me being tied to a chair. 
[02:25:30]  Let's calm down.  Did you ever hear the actual recordings from the subway car?  What?  Oh, no.  Years ago?  Yeah, this is something.  How could they have actual recordings?  I don't know, but they did.  There must be like a black box in there or something.  Hold it.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, is that what you said?  Bernie.  Drop it.  I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie.  Jesus.  Wow.  I think people need to get that off their mind. 
[02:26:00]  Like, I hear people use the n-word.  Black people use it with themselves and stuff in their songs.  And they should kind of, it's just one more example of people's heads being in a bad place.  I think if people were vegetarian, their heads would be in generally much better places.  Hey, someone's spine was in a bad place in front of your gun.  Remember him, Daryl Cavy?  No, I don't.  You're the one who said...  I know.  I keep bringing it up.  I can't get over it.  For me, it's just ears.  It's all crawfish, by fucking self.  Crawfish.  Let me explain.  You stink. 
[02:26:30]  A group of people get shot.  Right.  It's normal in shootings, pistol shootings like that.  One in five people die.  You shoot a group of people.  Some are going to walk away from it with minor injuries.  Some are going to get killed.  Some will get major injuries.  Paralyzed.  It turns out that a piece of a bullet hit him in the spine and paralyzed him.  It was one of four.  And if he had been a hundredth of an inch or one inch in a different position, or if the trigger had gone down one hundredth of a second sooner or a one hundredth of a second later, it would have meant a difference with him. 
[02:27:00]  For him, tremendous, tremendous effect.  Hey, how about they didn't come on the train and ask you for money?  How about that?  Well, right.  And everyone would have been fine.  They could have gone to college and gotten a career.  Well, I don't know about that, but there was a real problem with street crime.  And just so people know, what people are putting up in Iraq today is really not much worse than what we were putting up in New York City 20 years ago.  And again, they didn't have to put up with the daily intimidation and fear that the public puts up. 
[02:27:30]  They get whammed with these big bombs occasionally, but it falls flat on its face.  So, you know, all of a sudden they're smiling, having a good time, and they're blown up.  Instead of in New York 20 years ago, you're walking around in fear.  So it was worse New York 20 years ago than Baghdad today.  Probably the resentment, right.  And if they're trying to terrorize the population in Iraq, it's just totally back.  I remember, you know something?  You bring up a good point, because I remember years ago driving down the LIE, and a roadside bomb blew up and took out like 20 cars on the LIE. 
[02:28:00]  No?  No, I was just Harry Chapin driving.  But again, you kill one in a thousand people, you just make them mad.  Even if you kill one in a hundred, you make them mad.  You make them madder.  You kill one in a hundred, you make them madder.  All right, let's get on to the next story.  All right.  Oh, next.  No, no, it's over there, Bernie.  Next story is new stories.  My stories?  And then.  Well, okay, I don't know.  Because nothing's happening.  I just bought the Inquirer, the Weekly World News.  It says here that. 
[02:28:30]  Well, there's a lot happening in the news.  What about the Michael Jackson case?  Well, I don't care about that.  What about the Oscars?  I don't care about that.  What about the Oscars?  I think the Oscars, there are a lot of good movies out there.  It doesn't matter if they win the Oscars or not.  I saw that movie, Aviator.  I think DiCaprio did a good, he did a good acting job.  I think they maybe should have given, like they sometimes give Oscars to people,  because the guy who did that movie, Skorkaski or something, he came out with many.  Skorkaski?  Whatever it is.  You know who I, you know who I'm talking about.  No, I don't know who you mean.  Well, it's somebody. 
[02:29:00]  What's his name?  The guy who came out with the movie, Aviator.  He did a lot of good movies.  Yeah, what's his name?  I don't know.  I'd have to read one of the papers here to be able to, I still couldn't pronounce it.  I think they called him Marty.  Skorkaski?  Yeah, that.  Skorkaski.  Skoladdy.  Skoladdy?  Marty something.  Wait, what's his last name?  Seriously.  I don't know.  No, Bernie, you're educating people.  What's his last name?  A good movie that I saw, a documentary, a real interesting one, was called Hotel Rwanda.  And it wasn't that popular.  When I saw it, the movie theater was empty.  It was about the genocide that occurred in the African country. 
[02:29:30]  That's why it was a good movie to Bernie.  Wow.  That was a comedy.  Bernie's ultimate dream.  Life.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  I thought Adam Sandler was going to be in this.  People, in terms of, in terms of modern history, people focus on World War II, they focus on  the extermination of the Jews, in that country, one million people were wiped out in about 
[02:30:00]  a two-week period, and it shows how it can happen.  It was very scary.  If you're interested in talk radio, remember on the talk radio there, they had the government  actually telling people, go out and kill the cockroaches, and stuff like that.  And it shows how easy it is to take over a third world country.  The person I saw it with, or one person said they had a good impression of the French, because  the French were the last foreign troops to leave the country.  But what it turned out, in how the country was being supplied with weapons, they bought 
[02:30:30]  millions of machetes, 10 cents each, from China.  And they were being sold for 15 cents in the country, just steel blade, stainless steel  blade, with a wood handle.  But then for the government, there was a small section of the government.  All they did was supply them with military equipment, consisting of guns, ammunition,  two-way radios, and jeeps.  And with that, you can, with a bunch of thugs, take over a whole country.  And, and, uh, uh, it's a scary movie, and it's a realistic movie. 
[02:31:00]  It's, 99% of it is good.  The last 1%, they show this corny white, white...  Oh, don't tell us, I didn't see it.  No, but I'm not telling you.  No, don't tell me, I didn't see it.  There's a white liberal ending.  Come on, the white, the white woman is walking with a black eye.  Don't tell me, I didn't see it.  Oh, the white woman is walking with a black eye, hand in hand.  All right, but that was...  Ah, yuck.  That's not even half percent of the movie, but the rest of it was scary.  Wow, that bugs me.  And, by the way, it's about a guy who was, he's like half American, half European.  He's a black guy who runs a hotel there. 
[02:31:30]  And people had...  Where did it take place?  In a country called Rwanda.  Don Cheadle.  It shows how scary it was being a UN troop.  The UN troops were ordered not to fight back.  And yet, at the same time, the other, the Hutu military did not want to wipe out...  Who?  The Hutu military.  They were doing the extermination.  Which two?  What?  You two?  They did not want to wipe out UN troops.  Yeah, right.  They were reluctant to.  They would be willing to.  And it was a good movie.  We're seeing...  Why didn't they want to wipe out UN troops?  Bad public relations.  The only people who had any influence with them was the French. 
[02:32:00]  And that's because the French were supplying them with the weapons.  Ah.  It was the French were supplying the military...  Always for the money, the French.  Okay.  And yet, in some of the media here, the French had the high moral ground.  They were the last to leave.  The reason they were the last to leave is they were part of the backbone of the operation.  They had some financial gain there is why.  Oh, their influence afterwards.  Of course.  They had the ultimate influence with the government.  How would you end the movie?  What?  Instead of that corny scene with the white and the black person walking down the street, 
[02:32:30]  how would you shot that last scene?  Hmm.  Well, you could have just left it out.  That's true.  The movie was a little bit long the way it was.  You know, they could have cut a little bit more of it out.  It was...  It was...  You know, they showed some white person who was helping some black people and stuff like  that, and they showed her at the end.  And that really bothered you, didn't it?  No, no, it didn't really bother me, but it wasn't necessary.  Right.  Of course not.  Because it showed a lot about world politics, world reality.  Not necessary.  Like that last bullet.  And what people...  Right.  No, the last bullet hit James Ramsey.  Right, right. 
[02:33:00]  He wasn't even shot once.  No.  So that's a problem.  There's no problem.  Bernie, I don't want you to...  Anthony has no problem with you.  ...misunderstand me.  You are like an action hero to me.  Huh?  You're like an action hero to me.  I love your work.  Believe me.  You're like me, man.  You're just like me.  Remember that?  I've heard that before.  Yeah.  It's...  Anybody can shoot a gun.  It's the real Charles Brisson.  Driving a car is a lot harder than shooting a gun well, than shooting a pistol well. 
[02:33:30]  Driving a car is harder.  In New York City, definitely.  In a subway car.  If traffic is crowded on the streets of New York...  If you drive a car and hold the steering wheel with one hand, that's very similar to shooting  a gun.  I've never actually hit four cabs in five seconds.  You never tried.  Just imagine how many people you can mow down with a car, though.  Yeah.  A car?  Come on.  A car?  You're kidding.  People do that occasionally.  As long as the road sign is MLK Boulevard, right?  Right.  Bernie?  No?  No?  No?  Nothing.  All right.  Next story? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, well, anyway, the choir...  Just because there's a lack of other news, and no news is good news...  Oh, we have the Michael Jackson case.  It's one of the biggest cases of all time.  He doesn't care.  That's his sex life.  He doesn't care.  Here's some...  It's his sex life.  Chelsea's wedding is off.  Speaking of sex.  Molestations.  Chelsea's sex life.  Wait, hold on, Bernie.  I'll discuss his music.  I won't get involved in his sex life.  Hold on, Bernie.  Hold on.  It says on the front of the...  All right, hold on.  We'll go there in a second, but you just brought up something very interesting.  The Michael Jackson case.  You brought it up. 
[02:34:30]  It's just his sex life, and you don't want to discuss that?  No, well, there's a little thing they had on the news that bothered me, and that is the  woman, the mother of the child who was suing.  In the past, she tried to sue and extort a celebrity, and the only witness who claimed to have seen  Michael Jackson actually handling this boy's private parts is this boy's brother.  They both have the same mother.  And again, this family had had a history of extorting celebrities in the past for money.  So I'm very skeptical of it. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, but what about the fact that he sleeps with young boys, and this is confirmed?  Yeah, sure.  Okay, that's a different...  People sleep like that in many different societies.  People like...  The Puerto Ricans sleep like that.  The Puerto Ricans, right?  Ten in a bed, right?  Ten in a bed.  Okay, now...  Yeah, but it's in a secret room, though.  Okay, but...  With a buzzer when someone else is approaching.  But again, they sleep like that in the trunk when they're being driven across the border.  People are willing...  There's a big shortage of money in the world, and a lot of people are willing to lie for 
[02:35:30]  money.  These people have had a history of doing this in the past, and I'm just very skeptical.  I don't know, and there's many other problems in the world.  I don't really care.  The worst that'll happen is, I mean, a guilty guy might go to jail, or an innocent guy might  go to jail, or an innocent guy might go free, or a guilty guy might go free.  I think the English justice system is much better, where they use professional jurors,  generally.  Right.  And you have less...  I like the wigs.  Less guilty people go free, and perhaps, and just as important, less innocent people 
[02:36:00]  get wrongly convicted.  The system works better.  And like, for example, when you go out in the street, and you drive in your car, you  want a car that works.  That works better.  And with all the principles and everything people talk about in the United States here,  the English system works better.  But isn't it easier to corrupt a professional juror?  Oh, no.  No, but it is much easier to confuse a non-professional juror.  In my trial, people were expected to learn everything about a system, how the court systems 
[02:36:30]  and functions.  It's a lot more complicated than this radio station.  People don't pick it up.  In the United States, you have a system where attorneys are often trying to confuse the jurors.  It should be a fact-seeking process.  Do you think with the English system in place, do you think you would have been acquitted?  In the English system in place, I would have never been indicted for...  On the second trial.  Really?  For attempted murder, because you have a system that's based more on facts. 
[02:37:00]  Here, you have the legal system often works with the political system.  But don't you think the climate of the time and the people that were living in that, your  jury of peers, kind of looked at it like, yeah, I'm fed up with it, too?  No, no.  Because in this day and age, like today, I think you would be convicted.  No, let me explain.  All right.  Well, not in England.  The phrase is called criminalizing the conduct of your opponents.  My prosecution was very similar to... 
[02:37:30]  Remember Bill Clinton?  $40 million was spent on prosecuting him.  They found attorneys check into Whitewater, this and that, look at this, and finally, what  do they do?  They get him on something because he lied about having sex with some girlfriend or something  like that.  That's what they get him on.  Now, with me, they were looking for stuff like me.  They followed...  I drove across the United States once.  They followed...  Every city I went to was checked out and stuff like that.  They just...  They wanted to get me on anything, things unrelated to the subway incident. 
[02:38:00]  And it's, again, it's politics mixes much more with the legal system here.  Money buys you a result.  Money affects the system here.  All right.  Absolutely.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  So, anyway, instead of Michael Jackson, I think it's more interesting about Hillary Clinton...  Hillary's...  No, not Hillary Clinton.  She's not divorcing him.  Chelsea Clinton.  Chelsea.  That's right.  And her boyfriend is leaving the country.  Where are they going, Bernie?  I don't know.  I haven't gotten to that page yet. 
[02:38:30]  But I don't...  This is on the front of the Enquirer.  This is what I bought this magazine for.  All right.  So, who knows?  But she's a vegetarian.  She's a vegetarian and she's leaving America.  I wonder if they left each other or if the parents had anything to do with it.  Where would it be?  There's got women.  O.J. Furious.  O.J. Simpson is furious.  Uh-oh.  For someone making him look bad.  Look bad.  How about that?  I'm trying to find the Hillary Clinton.  Here we go.  Do you think O.J. was innocent or guilty of the murders? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, I think...  I think they should kill everybody.  They should kill him, the victims, the families, the prosecutors.  Wow, Bernie.  And definitely the attorneys.  They should kill the attorneys.  All of his...  Him, his defense team, the prosecutors.  Kill everyone.  And half the people in L.A.  They're all phony.  They're phony actors.  Right.  They're all phony stars.  Kill Vicki.  Kill Marsha Clark.  Kill them all.  Well, that's a generalization.  But, you know, maybe not all. 
[02:39:30]  Just get a machine gun and take them all out.  Right, Bernie?  Uh-oh.  Wife plans to clone Rodney.  Is that what I'm saying?  They say she's reeling from a devastating blow.  Well, who knows?  Who cares?  You see?  Right.  Who even cares?  Who cares?  This is no news is good news.  All right.  That kind of thing.  Bernie, any other news before we take a break here?  Now, I'm going to be here another ten minutes or so.  I guess that's about it.  Or five minutes.  Or what am I...  Maybe 30 seconds.  Okay.  Because I don't find much...  Here's Johnny Carson. 
[02:40:00]  Chose to end his life.  Oh, this is BS.  I don't believe that.  You don't believe that, right?  Nah.  Gossip party.  What about Rodney Dangerfield's wife?  I never...  What about her?  There was something in there.  She wants to clone Rodney.  One of the funniest things I ever saw.  He was strapped in.  Wait, wait.  What did you say?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What did you say?  It's one of the funniest things you ever saw.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bernie, Bernie.  What did you say?  One of the funniest things I saw.  Things you saw.  All right.  Hold on.  Strap in, everyone.  Here it comes.  Hold on.  Dirk, the boys ready in the booth? 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  They're ready for one of the funniest things you ever saw.  No.  They wouldn't have anything coming.  Hold on.  No.  It was from a ride.  Bring on the funny.  Billy?  Billy, you ready?  I'm ready.  Billy, I put my drink down.  All right.  Hold on.  Everyone is just ready, I think, now, Bernie.  Everybody is ready.  Okay.  It was Raji Dangerfield.  Raji.  Wait, wait.  Who's Raji?  That is fun.  Indian comic?  That's carrying a boom bird.  Hold on.  We're all talking over you, Bernie.  I get no respect.  I get no respect. 
[02:41:00]  My doctor, Dr. Abula Galala.  Yep.  They'd all change if they were vegetarian.  The whole world.  All right.  We get it.  What's the funniest thing you've ever seen?  Funniest thing.  Oh, yeah.  Rodney, there's some scene in some tape where Raji Dangerfield is carrying a boom box.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who?  He's carrying a boom box.  Who is?  Wait, wait, wait.  We're all talking over you again.  We're all talking over you again, Bernie.  He's tipping people heavily.  Who is?  Who?  Wait.  He's acting like a hot shot.  Rodney Dangerfield.  All right.  Rodney Dangerfield's carrying a boom box.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  There's something, you know, he's dancing around like I'm too sexy, whatever.  Whatever.  Really?  Whatever he was.  That was cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  Okay.  Where'd you get that turban?  And anyway, that's...  With a turban like that, you'll get a free bowl of soup.  No, it's good on you, though.  That's basically the news.  Who cares if Lisa Minnelli is fighting with Carol Chandler?  Lisa Minnelli, right.  Right?  Who cares?  Who cares if somebody... 
[02:42:00]  Carol Chandler.  If you can get rid of wrinkles and lose your weight, there's a 500-pound woman.  People wouldn't be 500-600 pounds if they were vegetarian.  Vegetarian.  Right away, you want to see a good movie, there's a movie called Super Size Me.  It's about McDonald's.  Even if you don't eat at McDonald's, you should see that movie, because you'll learn about what  a few percent of the country goes through.  Outside the United States, people eat...  Who directed that?  Outside of New York City.  But no one eats McDonald's like this guy was trying to claim.  Nobody, absolutely.  Nobody does.  You're correct there.  But he ate nothing but that diet for one week. 
[02:42:30]  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and food.  Oh, it was for a month.  I'm sorry, for one month.  Thank you.  Who directed that?  What was that called?  I don't know the guy's name.  Okay, but it's called Super Size Me.  You would think it makes the guy physically sick.  It will be an education, and it was very honestly done.  About 1% or 2% of the United States actually lives that way.  A lot of people eat lots of fast food.  They do it much more outside of New York City, and also, people outside of New York City don't 
[02:43:00]  exercise.  They drive everywhere.  You're a vegetarian, right?  Yes.  In New York City, people walk 50 or 100 times as much as the average American.  Right.  You know, because most people here don't own cars.  They said, which I don't believe, that many New Yorkers walk up to 5 miles a day.  Wow.  I don't know if I believe that.  I don't know if I buy that.  I don't know if I buy that either.  I don't know about that.  But they walk much more.  Not Daryl Kaby.  I lived in the country, and in the country, if I would buy a newspaper or a bag of potato 
[02:43:30]  chips, I would get in the car and have to drive to a little place to get it.  Yes, you would indeed.  Any little thing.  Any little thing.  Absolutely.  You don't hear in the city.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  Fantastic point.  It is.  So, Hotel Rwanda.  I think we'll see where you're going with this.  Supersize me, Hotel Rwanda.  You can get them on tape.  I don't think any of them are playing.  Was anything in the Weekly World News you wanted to discuss?  Oh, well, there's some huge fat woman here on the front cover.  Maybe she'll go.  Who knows?  Something about space aliens doing this. 
[02:44:00]  I don't believe that.  Really?  There's a baby born with armpit hair.  I wonder if that has to do with hormones.  Wow.  You believe in aliens?  It's possible.  It's possible.  It's possible.  Possible.  I like that.  The Bush...  Would you shoot an alien?  It says here...  It says Bush and Cheney are building a resort bomb shelter.  And they say, while the rest of us vaporize, fat cats will be playing golf and frolicking in hot tubs.  They're going to play golf and frolicking in hot tubs.  And then they show this real busty girl in the Republican ad. 
[02:44:30]  I guess she's going to be in the pot tub.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to include this...  The pot tub.  With big booms, it's going to be in the bomb shelter with the Republicans.  They got it all.  Food, big TVs...  Makes a boss sound like Olivier, doesn't it?  I know.  Busk and Cheney.  Oh, my God.  The pot tub.  I don't believe that.  I won't even mention that.  Wow.  Man bottles virgin gas.  I don't know what it's about.  Virgin gas.  Well, get to know...  Snakes.  It's probably healthy.  Terrorists. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, the terrorists are going to have annual games.  First annual terrorist games.  Like an Olympic game.  Shoot by the Olympics for their shooting up bombings.  Who knows what kind of stuff.  That's good.  That's some great stuff.  That's wacky.  Al-Qaeda killers go for the gold.  That's good.  And bizarre events.  Bombs away.  They're going to make threatening videotapes.  There's going to be a thing for that.  Really?  Threatening tapes will be a competition.  Right.  Beheadings.  Shooting infidels will be another area.  Yeah.  Okay.  Groveling to Osma Bin Laden.  Infidels.  I guess that's called... 
[02:45:30]  Groveling to Osma Bin Laden.  Osma Bin Laden.  Yeah.  There's a story about the richest kid in the world.  Hold on.  I want to hear about groveling to Osma Bin Laden.  I have no idea.  Lossless, lossless.  Oh, our leader demands our utmost loyalty.  Infidels.  In this contest, each man must lie at Osma's feet.  Lick and kiss his boots.  Osma.  And et cetera, et cetera.  Uh-oh.  This year, my speech, which I am still composing, goes da-da-da-da-da.  Anyway. 
[02:46:00]  Camel kissing.  Camel kissing?  I don't...  I think that's not a...  That doesn't sound real.  Crazy, Bernie.  That sounds crazy.  If anybody would know crazy.  Right.  So no news is good news.  So everyone can be comfortable.  What else?  You're just passing...  You're flipping through it all.  There's nothing to see here.  You're inside.  You're safe from the...  Look at that.  That's what he said on the subway.  Nothing to see here.  Keep it moving.  Move on.  And she's trying to make a cute face.  That's the other guy that can't.  See?  Do you get that, Bernie?  Is that face...  She is trying to make...  You are so funny. 
[02:46:30]  That is absolutely true.  Wow.  It's a big fat woman, and she's got her head turned, and she's trying to make a cute face.  Trying to look sexy, right, Bernie?  Yeah.  Why not?  Well, five people can be sexy, right?  Well, you know, any port in the storm.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  I like that.  Bernie's got a hogging.  Judge places hottie under house arrest.  Here's a girl, very sexually dressed...  Now, she's hot.  ...in chains, and there's a judge in his black robe standing next to her.  Yeah.  That sounds like... 
[02:47:00]  Saucy.  ...getting to that.  What else you got in there?  A new story.  Some workers are demanding less pay.  Bernie loves the Weekly World News.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this?  There's an article.  This is a new revelation about history that the Vikings were sissies.  They were actually sissies.  The Vikings were sissies?  I wonder if I look at that facial...  And they use that word, sissies?  Wow.  I don't believe that.  You see that one Weekly World News where the headline was, Bernie gets to the point?  Huh.  Well, this is the news.  This is the news. 
[02:47:30]  I see it.  There's a bunch of pictures of dead animals and stuff.  Oh, that's sad.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle.  I wouldn't even know how to do that.  And then other...  Let's see.  Nonsense.  Some personal ads.  Six-letter word for target.  It starts with N.  Here's something everyone here could learn.  Script club etiquette.  Ten essential do's and don'ts.  Okay?  Okay?  Wait, wait.  What was that?  I missed that.  Oh, look.  There's another...  Oh, so what? 
[02:48:00]  Look.  Here's another article.  The Republicans now...  They're fighting for Caucasian History Month.  Oh!  We want...  And they show a picture of Donald Trump shouting with Ronald Reagan standing in the background.  I bet you'd be honored during that month.  They want Caucasian History Month.  I would honor you during that month.  Wait, what did that say?  Where's that other thing?  I want to hear...  What month is he on the Klan calendar?  This is a new one.  Just hit the news.  They have him shirtless for July.  Strip club...  Wait, was that strip club?  What was the name of that?  Oh, look. 
[02:48:30]  Here's other stuff.  History.  Jesus drove his brother to drink.  It's possible.  Etiquette.  Get Craig Christ ready.  That's how we'll end there.  You see?  Craig Christ from Stephen Lund.  This is about vegetarian.  They're showing giant pictures of mutant vegetarian...  Mutant vegetables.  Mutant vegetables.  This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take a swim and read it.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the stripper etiquette?  We'll end with stripper etiquette.  What is there, you know, you just do nothing.  You know, buy drinks, put money in their belt, and say nothing is usually the best thing. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  Just look.  Look and enjoy.  Bernie, would you like to go to a strip club with us?  Nah.  No?  No, why not?  We'll take you out.  Oh, thanks.  That'd be fun.  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Nah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nah.  Okay.  Metaporno on the internet.  Gotta get bullets.  So that's the news.  And no news is good news.  Wow, Bernie.  We're safe.  Definitely easier to shoot a gun.  And drive a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laugh at me.  I'll get out of here.  I'm a good shooter.  I'm a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter. 
[02:49:30]  Definitely a good shooter.  Yeah.  And I want my CD back.  What CD?  That one CD.  You played one CD of that nice music in the beginning.  Of course, Wapner comes on it.  That was the om.  Yeah.  Remember that om you played one music of that?  You played about a minute and a half of that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bernie, I love when you come on.  Yeah.  I love when you come on.  The first 40 minutes were quite boring, but, man, you made up for it.  You made up for it for the last 10 minutes.  Well, I didn't mean to.  I thought it was the worst. 
[02:50:00]  What did we learn, Anthony?  That Jesus Christ drove his own brother to drink.  His brother to drink.  That mutant fat chicks make sexy faces sometimes.  The first half adequate.  Adequate.  It's easier to shoot a pistol than to drive a car with one hand.  Osma Bin Laden.  Oh, Bernie, what are you doing, Bernie?  Of Osma.  It's right here.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  No, no, no.  You've got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's in a thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  Wow, you rule, Bernie. 
[02:50:30]  No, no.  This one, right?  It says arm on the front.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Tony, you're asking for trouble.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie, sit down.  Oh, my God.  He's really mad.  You pissed off, Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here. 
[02:51:00]  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay, Paul.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  I need to get that fucking seat.  You hand it over.  Yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another. 
[02:51:30]  You lunatic.  Relax.  All right, Bernie.  He's Frank Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Paul.  You tell him to relax.  Paul, he's fine.  Tell him to relax.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean...  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie's leaving!  Oh, man.  See, you got his CD?  Give him his CD.  Oh, you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie! 
[02:52:00]  Bernie!  Oh, he's going into his bag.  He's going into his bag.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  He's zipping up.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never...  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Oh, he took a fake...  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, wasn't it a CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him into the CD?  Eric's going after him.  He says he's going to shoot you now.  Holy shit.  He was pissed.  I think we saw some of that rage. 
[02:52:30]  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV  where the guy finally snapped from the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Here we go.  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Lex, that's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, he didn't break yours.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we did.  Bernie, the joke.  He had another CD. 
[02:53:00]  Whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't you relax?  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home anyway.  They still want to talk to you.  Go back inside and at least...  Let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back in and talk.  He's coming in.  Nice to meet you.  Wait, that sounds scary.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  All right, wait.  Sit down, sit down. 
[02:53:30]  Sit down.  Sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie, let me explain what happened, though, Bernie, because we can't explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Because I don't explain.  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here.  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show, that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Okay.  Right here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy.  You said it.  That's fine.  Wow.  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in, and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we still pals?  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  Yes, I'm glad we had the story.  I'm glad we had the story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you okay, or just, or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  You think we're okay.  Bernie does not like...  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you. 
[02:54:30]  All right?  Don't look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Well, I didn't smash your CD, though.  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said,  I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael Jackson.  Well, there you go.  That's bad.  I know.  There's only a CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So, we're cool.  We're cool.  And, anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay?  Very good.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know...  I hear you.  And it's... 
[02:55:00]  All right.  It's up a...  Phew!  Yeah, that was cool.  The fool and the gang.  That was intense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, boy.  It's just all night and day.  The way he can turn it on.  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything is open.  Bernie, shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  What's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:55:30]  That's okay.  All right.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch you...  We didn't watch you...  It's going to be a mild winter.  Mild winter.  We didn't watch you going away, Mad.  You all right?  All right.  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  That looks like the same Steve jacket he was probably wearing back in my knee.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, good.  Bernie, good.  Is this Bernie, is this yours?  Oh, yes.  No, no.  Eric, that's...  Yeah.  Say again?  Yes, you did.  He's coming back in.  All right.  He's walking up.  Wow, man. 
[02:56:00]  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah, Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man.  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind pissed.  Hey, you know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was kind  of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, he just like, ah, just lost his mind. 
[02:56:30]  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just lost.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You better.  Have another.  Keep your CD. 
[02:57:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm still shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie Getz right here in your face.  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad.  You can't reason with him.  No.  No.  He just walked out.  He was convinced you smashed that CD of his.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like He Smashed It?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him, 
[02:57:30]  going, there was a CD.  I have it.  Because he needs to know where everything is.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world.  Yeah.  And then he sat back down.  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you, I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie. 
[02:58:00]  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting there with this hand trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it.  Nope.  He's just sitting there going, oh my God.  He's going to hit it.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Oh.  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath. 
[02:58:30]  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD.  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told.  It does this when it's told.  Do you want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would you say a great big black person?  We're going to do that.  A CD, is that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Burr in studio, like I said. 
[02:59:00]  And also we have Joe Rogan's Gangsta Fag stuff that he wants to turn us on to.  We'll finally play a few tracks from that next, okay?  Fine.  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Getz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his own brother to drink.  He was.  I forgot everything that happened.  Well, it's just before that snap.  It's just a segue.  Yeah.  Just a segue.  Huh?  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  That was really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the, he was the second most crazy person in this room. 
[02:59:30]  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie, and Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds.  He was in the other room calming down, doing his little.  Oh, doing his calm down procedure.  Did they get video of that?  Yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep, he stayed right there with the camera.  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I've got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  But did he know the directions to get here to this studio? 
[03:00:00]  Probably in his office there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh, wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard the eye.  It was getting hot.  It looks like rain.  Oh, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  John.  Yo.  Hey.  John, how fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Ketz in the goddamn studio?  That's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  Ted Asner's one thing.  He's 80.  Yeah, what's Ted Asner going to do?  And Ed has never shot anyone. 
[03:00:30]  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out.  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Master Poe, you all right?  No, no.  I'm going to talk to Marcelino, and I'm going to find out.  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah, the 15 seconds of, yeah. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  You did great.  You did great.  It's good.  But I want to get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Poe?  I heard, like, you just kind of sit...  Poe is pissed off now, too.  Poe is freaking right now.  Nothing was going to happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie.  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  Here's what they call in the zone right now.  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio, so when there is one, and you're the security  guy, you don't want to, like, not be there.  15-second delay.  A lot can happen. 
[03:01:30]  I'm sure that he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Yeah, Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it.  Please.  No one hears...  Yeah, the security guy, 15 seconds after the fact, he's hearing what's going on.  We'll get him a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I.  Oh, I know.  Poe's pissed.  Everyone's freaked now.  Ben is on the phone with Washington now.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio. 
[03:02:00]  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding a Bernie guest.  Always.  But I'm saying, you guys enjoy it, though.  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bag?  Bernie's probably on his way to a pawn shop right now.  Right.  Todd from California.  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  We might have wrecked his whole campaign.  I hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on. 
[03:02:30]  Bring in the nude girls.  They could give them a laugh dance.  A waiting pool pool of mud and a 12-year-old.  Ted, here.  Hold this blunt object.  Now bring in the girls.  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted?  Yeah.  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah, these girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted.  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio?  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead. 
[03:03:00]  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon.  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon and Ted Bundy.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bungy, as Bernie would call him.  Did he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say?  Rodgy.  That was my favorite one.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  Oh, you're a very dangerous man.  Bernie Gates.  Rodgy. 
[03:03:30]  Now I kid you fucking kidding.  He ran right over, pointing.  Oh, he was...  Oh, is he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry.  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right.  He was falling down.  That was it.  Bernie.  I'm like you, man.  God damn.  I'm just like you.  That's every thug's worst nightmare is some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad  that fucking quickly.  Looks like the mild-mannered Easy Mark.  Yeah.  And he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet, 
[03:04:00]  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the  next year.  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on.  That would be huge.  If you pulled through, his record isn't that good.  You know, he shot four guys and none of them died, so you'd probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, so much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  Have another piece of broccoli and I'll take some asparagus and, you know, the fucking  CD.  Put the CD in the fucking basket.  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans.  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office. 
[03:05:00]  No.  We want to see you snap and go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to see.  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  We wanted to see that.  Four hours of horrible news.  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah.  He's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually make him snap.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie 
[03:05:30]  Guest go, you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  You can just hear him snapping.  Is there any way to pull that audio before the end of the show?  Yeah, definitely.  I want to hear him losing his mind.  I've got to hear him losing his mind.  We'll replay it after the break.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would actually have done if he actually had gotten  to Opie.  I don't know.  No, he probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him. 
[03:06:00]  I mean, he used lethal force last time.  Would he have took his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun at a drop.  I don't think he's...  He doesn't strike me as a grappler.  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap.  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic.  He had a shovel, and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant.  That's where your gun's buried, by the way.  That's where he buried his gun.  All right.  Still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do a...  A lot of people are saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show. 
[03:06:30]  No, we won't.  No, he'll be back.  No one else is going to let him talk for an hour about nothing.  Of course.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Because he brought up Jesus driving his own brothers to drink.  Somewhere in there, he said that.  So check this out, and we'll continue.  Check, check, test one.  Dude, it's not like we have Zeppelin in the studio.  It's Lance.  It should be good enough.  What?  Do what?  Nice. 
[03:07:00]  That's your sound check.  Dude, I don't...  Four, one...  Oh, count?  One, two, three, four?  One, two...  All right.  Up or low?  Okay.  Oh.  Well.  All right.  It's a Bible song.  All right.  Here it is.  Stephen Lynch.  It's about a little-known biblical character.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame.  Well, I am Jesus' brother. 
[03:07:30]  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God.  But Craig, don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's inside, we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine, but into cold-coated light.  I'm not my brother, I know. 
[03:08:00]  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas grow.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  Craig Christ.  I hang out with lepers, Barabbas and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles. 
[03:08:30]  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  No, wait.  I already did that line.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna replay this a million times on our show.  You messed it up.  Oh, yeah.  I know what it is.  All right, God.  Jesus performs miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if it brought a fuckin' lady home. 
[03:09:00]  Because while Jesus is prayin', fuckin' Craig is layin'.  Every lady in the Testament, you know what I'm sayin'.  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin.  But if you got a little sister, then there's room at this end.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  Yeah, I'm fuckin' Craig.  Yeah, I'm fuckin' Craig.  Craig Christ. 
[03:09:30]  Craig Christ.  Jesus was our mother's faith.  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry  when he's nailed to that tree.  And now the question for you  is not what would Jesus do.  But where will you be when the Craig machine  comes partying through.  And if the Lord would allow, 
[03:10:00]  you've got to ask yourself how and who and why  and when and where is your Messiah now.  It's fuckin' Craig.  Fuckin' Craig.  Fuckin' Craig.  Hey, now.  Fuckin' Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  I'm fuckin' Craig. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, right on, man.  Steven Lynch on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear your sinuses.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea.  Close your eyes and drift away with O and A.  Take that, Pop.  Hi.  This is great.  No.  You dick.  No.  Bye, aye, aye.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[03:11:00]  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  You rule, Bernie.  No.  No.  This one, right?  It says, um, on the front.  Oh.  What are you?  Motherfucker. 
[03:11:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  I'll take a bullet.  Wow.  Everyone calm?  Yeah, we were all just talking about how surreal that was.  How it was just one of those moments that, if you get anyone through history that has done  something, and then to see them actually in that same circumstance and in that same mindset 
[03:12:00]  doing that, that was pretty much it.  You know, that was, that was Bernie Getz losing his mind.  You know, ready, if he had that revolver in his hand, you were done.  We were done.  Everyone's done.  He just would have went around the room like he went around that subway car, just bang, bang, bang.  Who would he have shot last?  Me. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, we probably.  We probably.  It would have been worse.  I decided I got to see everybody get shot, and then I would have tried to plead with him  a little bit, and, you know, work with Bernie, me and you, what have I ever done, you know,  and then boom.  It would have been me, and then I think it would have been Billy Burr, because he kind  of looks like me.  Actually, after you, he probably would have had to reload, because he'd have pumped every  single shot in a gun into your stupid head.  The scariest part was when he ran out of the studio and then went for his bag.  Yeah.  Who knows what's in there?  Who knows?  And Billy's just looking through the window like, hey, wow. 
[03:13:00]  Total suburb guy.  Yeah, your mic's not on.  Oh, there's the mic.  Turn that on.  Turn that on, God damn it.  I need control of that mic.  I really do.  Yeah.  Just saying, totally, I grew up in the suburbs, and I'm like, wow, there's a psycho who shot  people, and now he's going into his bag in total rage.  Not thinking maybe you should be seen.  How's this going to play out?  Looking for a sharp carrot or something.  You know, it's funny, any time I'm in a comedy club, I always hate when, like, black  comics do, like, the things about the dumb white people sitting there, you know.  And you know, if that guy ran out of the post office, I literally was that fucking  white guy. 
[03:13:30]  Wow, look at him.  Yeah.  Bernie gets.  Yeah, white guy just stand there.  I'm that guy.  Yeah.  You just stand there looking, going, huh, wow.  Hey, look, he's got a gun.  Cool.  Bernie with a gun.  Let me get a picture.  Instead of trying to run for your life.  Bernie's got a gun.  That was, uh, something.  Well, did you see that pizza parlor video with that guy, that black guy smashing that  black guy's face?  That is maddening.  Everybody's just sitting there watching us.  Just standing there watching us.  What are you going to do?  What would you do if you were in that town?  There's a video out there. 
[03:14:00]  Ope, have you seen it yet?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Big, fat black chick.  Big, huge, fat, big, white, uh, black guy.  Uh, the black chick is getting into a little altercation with some guy.  Looks like an Italian guy.  A pizza place.  In a pizza place.  And, uh, she's getting in his face and yelling and, and, uh, the guy's yelling back at her.  Well, her boyfriend, this huge black guy, comes walking in and, uh, sees the little thing  happening.  Walks up to the white guy and hit him so hard.  You can, I have never seen a punch that hard in a professional fight the way this guy 
[03:14:30]  hit this guy.  Totally put him out of commission right there.  And then just keeps punching him and kicking him and just pelts this guy.  The guy didn't go down at first.  He knocked him into the door.  Yeah.  He had him, like, five times.  He tried to get out of the place and he was moving in slow motion, bent over.  He couldn't function as a human anymore.  But it was, like, five other white people around.  I mean, the only thing I'll say is this.  It was a one-on-one.  It was one guy against one guy and he wasn't using a weapon.  So it's, like, easy to say, why did they jump in?  That guy was a weapon. 
[03:15:00]  Jesus.  I probably wouldn't either.  You don't want to get the third man in.  Yeah, I wouldn't have jumped in.  That video clips up on foundrymusic.com.  I would absolutely not jump in.  That's how people get killed.  I don't care.  You know something?  If that black chick came up and got in my face and started saying, I'd be the biggest pussy.  I would do nothing.  I'd leave and then just, you know, racial epithets in my car.  Screaming at your windshield.  But there were, like, five guys there.  It's almost like people don't understand the group mentality. 
[03:15:30]  If five guys jump on one guy, he's going down.  I don't care how big he is.  He's five people.  But yet everybody just stood there and watched this guy get a beating.  I probably would have, too.  But you know what it is with a gang mentality?  Probably.  Yeah, you're right.  Well, if it was a friend of mine, then I would have felt even worse about watching him get a beating.  It's just individuals.  You're individuals.  It's not a group, you know?  Well, say if it was a gang like the Lords that you belonged to when you were in sixth grade.  Perhaps then you could all jump in.  But as individuals, you don't want to be the guy that jumps in.  Come on, guys.  Let's get him. 
[03:16:00]  And then he turns around and starts punching you in the face like that.  Oh, my God.  I'm watching the video right now.  Look at the one fat white guy.  He won't even look at the altercation.  No, no.  I want to see.  I want to see.  He's waiting for his pizza.  Yeah, rewind that.  Yeah, the one guy looks kind of like Big Kev, to be honest with you.  Look at this punch.  Go over there.  This is on foundrymusic.com.  You just punch in pizza parlor brawl, and they'll come up in the search engine.  See, the black chick's in the guy's face.  Yep.  Then her boyfriend comes over and just clocks this guy. 
[03:16:30]  Hard punch, man.  Oh!  Oh, my God!  And look at him.  He's trying to get out the door.  Nope.  Come back here, motherfucker.  This guy pulls him back in and just...  Uppercut.  Then, when all is said and done, he's laying on the floor, he takes his wallet and cell phone.  Did he take his wallet?  Yep.  Robbed him.  What happened to this guy?  Arrested.  Four years.  Four years.  Four years.  And the girl got 18 months.  Oh, she got 18 months? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Good.  All right, why don't we get...  Let's get back to the Bernie audio.  What a punch, though.  That first punch he gave him, one of the hardest punches I've ever seen.  He took his wallet, too?  Of course.  That's one of those punches you lose some hearing.  Ah, those are rough, man.  Bong!  Yeah, yeah, it's over.  Hey, where's the...  Scumbag.  Of course, he's got to take the wallet.  We got the audio.  We got the audio of Bernie.  So, Bernie was getting ready to leave, and he was obsessed with finding his CD.  Yeah.  He brings in these CDs with music on them.  Uh-huh.  And they're little cheap little CDs that you just burn on your computer. 
[03:17:30]  They're his, though.  Right.  Exactly.  His CDs help me.  It didn't look that important, so I thought I'd have some fun with him, and this is what  happened.  This one, right?  It says, um, on the front.  Oh!  What are you?  Motherfucker!  Tony!  Uh, both of you are asking for trouble.  Tony!  Tony!  You're asking for trouble!  Oh, Bernie!  Bernie, sit down!  Oh, I didn't hear him say you're asking for trouble.  You're asking for trouble.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.  I didn't hear that part.  You're asking for trouble. 
[03:18:00]  Let's hear that again.  This one, right?  It says, um, on the front.  Oh!  What are you?  You motherfucker!  Tony!  Uh, both of you are asking for trouble.  Tony!  Oh, he's coming over!  Oh, Bernie!  Bernie, sit down!  Sit down!  Oh, my God!  Wait!  He's really mad.  He's really mad.  You pissed off Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie. 
[03:18:30]  All right, sit down.  Stand up for your right, Bernie!  Sit down, Bernie!  Sit down!  It's okay!  It's not!  It's okay, Paul!  It's okay!  It's okay!  Paul, it's okay!  Paul, it's okay!  Paul, it's okay!  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take it.  Let's see.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Paul!  Paul!  I know you're here to get that fucking scene.  Can you hand it over?  Yeah!  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic. 
[03:19:00]  All right, Bernie, he's like, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Paul.  You tell him to relax.  Paul, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean...  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD out.  I'll be here again.  Bernie!  Oh, Bernie!  Oh, Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie's leaving!  Oh, man.  Wow, that's a little...  Fuck you!  Keep the CD!  That's a little creepier to listen to.  Ah!  Wow.  I didn't hear all that when it was going down.  That was quite the hullabaloo. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, man.  He's lost his mind.  I noticed you didn't punch him like Paul Bond.  No, no, no, no.  Well, no, I didn't want to punch him.  You're asking for trouble.  You're asking for trouble.  Yeah, that's great.  You know who I am.  All right.  Well...  Wow.  What do you say after that?  That was a good one.  Well, we have a new Ramon promo, Anthony.  Ramon.  We kind of started the show with the whole Ramon thing.  Where's Steve?  Is this one of Steve's? 
[03:20:00]  This is a real...  Yeah.  ...brand-new Ramon promo from the master himself, Steve.  Great.  We played about...  If you're just tuning in the show during the replay,  we have like 13 Ramon promos that the listeners made  in honor of Steve and his Ramon promos.  Hi, Steve.  Hey.  Where were you when all that was going down?  You used to be the guy.  You used to be the guy.  Remember, Ant?  No.  You know what?  When I heard it, Danny and I went running in with the camera. 
[03:20:30]  With the camera.  I heard it eight seconds after.  I heard it eight seconds after it went down,  and that's when I came in.  Oh, the camera was already out of here?  Yeah.  The camera was already gone,  so we only caught the tail end of it.  Oh, that stinks.  I know.  So we're going to instill a new rule  that says the camera stays in the producer's booth at all times,  so whoever's anywhere near it.  But I heard it eight seconds after.  That stinks.  You would have missed it.  I missed some great video.  I know.  That's what pisses me off royally.  That has nothing to do with security.  Huh?  In the future when somebody snaps.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure they'll be videotaped.  If you're going to be shot,  we need to get it on video.  That's great video. 
[03:21:00]  I'm sorry I missed it.  Well, all right.  Yeah, good job with the camera, squarcakesy.  So, a brand-new Ramon promo, huh?  That's right.  This is the one that Jimmy and I wrote over dinner in L.A.  That's right.  Well, you want to explain it a little bit?  No.  This is just Ramon clean this up part two.  Anything more than that, and I'll give it away.  All right.  All right.  So we know the deal with the Ramon promos.  If you don't, during the replay, 
[03:21:30]  we explain it further, right?  Yeah.  Okay, here it is.  Young lady.  What's wrong?  My dear, why on earth are you crying?  Please get up.  A bathroom floor is nowhere for you to be.  Oh, my.  Ramon.  Clean up this miscarriage.  Are you insane?  Jesus Christ.  Are you insane?  Look at how beat red Jimmy's face is. 
[03:22:00]  We're sitting in this rather upscale restaurant in L.A., and he's giggling like a jackass after saying that line.  I'm like, you really want me to make that?  Yeah, that's great.  Okay.  And I'm the psycho in this room, but crying.  That is horrible.  Ramon.  Yeah.  Well, he certainly wouldn't want to get his hands dirty cleaning up.  That kind of mess.  Why was he anywhere near a bathroom that she would be in? 
[03:22:30]  I'm guessing it's at his house.  Well, why would she be in his house?  No one said he's gay.  Why couldn't she be over there?  Maybe she's a pregnant friend.  Yeah.  Maybe she's a nurse.  Nah, he didn't really know her because he said young lady.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm going along.  He's in some kind of public setting and stumbles across.  Why would he be in a girl's room, though?  He was crying.  He was crying outside in the hall.  Walks in.  Walks in.  Rocks in.  See, I think he knows her because young lady could be a way you address.  A parent will address a daughter that way. 
[03:23:00]  Young lady, get in your room.  I thought she was some kind of a relative.  I didn't notice any familiarity there, though.  No.  I was actually going for the unfamiliar angle.  You know, he didn't know her.  He sees her crying.  He's trying to be compassionate.  Of course, Ramon is in tow.  And, you know, if he's trying to be compassionate, if he did know her, there would be something in his voice that would show he was a little upset that somebody he knew was miscarrying on the floor in front of him.  Right.  Instead of just, Ramon, clean this up.  It might have been like a, oh.  Exactly.  And that's kind of what I took into account when I did this was, oh, poor girl. 
[03:23:30]  I'm not touching that.  Right, right.  And that's why.  Because if you're going to have somebody else scoop up a miscarriage, you're probably going to, you're not going to, you probably don't know the person.  You might be afraid of disease.  You might be afraid of any number of things.  You might want somebody else.  That's what Ramon is for.  That's right.  That's what Ramon is for.  Nice.  Oh, I like it.  Good.  I'm glad.  I'm happy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was great.  Sick bastard.  Let's say hi to Neil in Connecticut.  Neil.  Yeah.  What's up, Neil?  Yeah, that gag about Ramon, that was Smithers from The Simpsons. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, okay.  Let's clean this up.  Boom.  All right, Neil.  Thank you.  And no, it is not me playing with the poker chips.  One guess, who could be playing with poker chips and fiddling and scraping yogurt cups and making any other noise on the air?  Who could it be?  I got a new game, though, Anthony, and you're going to love it. 
[03:24:30]  What is it?  Well, I rolled a poker chip, right?  Yeah.  If I do it just right, it rolls right back.  Oh, very good.  You just did it.  That's the new game.  Is that what everyone's hearing now on the air?  Yes.  They have to live through your little game hearing tick, tick, tick, tick.  Believe me, Bernie and I are very similar.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  There is a lot of...  I, too, have a psychofactor in my head.  I just don't shoot people.  All right.  What's wrong, Ben?  No.  All right.  Did he?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:25:00]  I know he's got to call Bernie later or somehow get in touch with him.  An email, maybe.  Yeah, there will be some emailing after today's episode.  We've got to smooth that over.  Billy Burr in studio.  Yes.  He picked a great day to come here.  Yeah.  Exciting.  How often do you see that?  Who do you guys have in tomorrow?  Son of Sam.  That would be good.  Yeah, we've got Wayne Williams.  We're going to bring some children in.  Son of Sam, you've got a little dog sitting here.  What's it saying?  What's he saying?  What's he saying?  Is that cool, Ben? 
[03:25:30]  What?  That was a good segment, right?  What segment?  Which segment?  Bernie?  Yeah, the Bernie thing.  That's great.  He wants to kill you now.  He was pissed.  I think we smoothed things over.  I don't know.  I think he holds on to stuff like that.  You think?  Yeah, stuff builds up.  Yeah.  But he knew you didn't break his CD, so it's not a problem.  You didn't break his thing.  If he went home and he had a broken CD, then I think he would obsess about that all night long.  You guys are like thinking logically.  You're applying logic to what you get.  Yeah, and we shouldn't. 
[03:26:00]  Not where Bernie's.  Do we have time to get into Gangsta Fag?  Yeah, I want to hear what this is.  This was from Joe Rogan, right?  Yeah.  Joe Rogan helped out the show while we were in L.A.  And he goes, guys, now that you're on satellite radio, I've got the perfect thing for you.  Because they can't play it on regular radio.  He's obsessed with this thing.  It's called Gangsta Fag.  Gangsta Fag.  Some gay black guy, right?  Yeah, I guess.  There he is.  And he writes rap songs like, you know, you usually hear the rap guys talking about bitches.  Having sex with the bitches. 
[03:26:30]  Disrespecting.  But this guy.  Yeah.  The pusses.  Disrespecting.  Yeah.  But this guy does the same type of music, but he's rapping about other men and ass fucks.  What, you listen to this?  No, that's what Joe Rogan said.  Oh, okay.  All right, well, here's a track called.  Yeah, I own all of his albums.  Here's a track called He Wants It.  He Wants It.  But wants is W-A-N-T-Z.  Z.  Of course it's Z. 
[03:27:00]  Good Bernie guest music.  He loves this stuff.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day.  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by in his really funky bands.  I could tell right away this motherfucker had things.  Was a white dude, about 30-something.  Kept staring at me, yelling like he wanted something.  He called me over and he asked for directions.  I saw his dick was hard, so I peeped his car. 
[03:27:30]  I said, you dying.  You know you ain't lost.  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no, it must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very straight.  So I said, take my number and my name.  You can call me up when you're sick of playing games.  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs it.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag, now you'll see them all.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you need? 
[03:28:00]  He needs it.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag,  then you'll send them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall.  One week later, and he finally called.  He said his family's home for a week or two.  And he was really bored and needed something to do.  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills.  A barman's house worth a couple of meals.  He said he wasn't gay, he just wanted to chat.  And a half hour later, he's massaging my back.  In his wife's rear, he gave me some hair.  Went in the next room, fucked on his kids' bed.  Fuck that we fucked like bitches in here. 
[03:28:30]  I came on his face and all over the shit.  I knew that I was telling him when I started getting sore.  I grabbed the kids' toe and I wiped my dick off.  He wanted to have a kid trying to recover.  I'm dressed in a mop as my car.  I heard the robber.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs some more.  So what the fuck you need?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  Oh, my kids said.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs some.  So what the fuck you need?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  The cake was so good that he just couldn't pass up. 
[03:29:00]  So all that week, yeah, I'm tearing that ass up.  Because he allowed to ride him and he left to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboys fuck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would pay him.  So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tap him.  He laced me with the cash and the visa platinum.  One month, Linda and the cat's out the bag.  Because this motherfucker started dressing in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  Oh, it's time to cut him off.  Because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg.  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg.  Screaming, don't leave, please twist it, G. 
[03:29:30]  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  Ha!  Yeah, you're a real monster.  So what the fuck you think?  You're a real tough guy.  So what the fuck you need?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you need?  He needs it.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants it.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  This is Tom's life.  Tom is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Tom.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son. 
[03:30:00]  We have a life together.  You stay away from me, you son of a bitch.  Ramone.  Clean that black man's shiz off our team.  Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted, Twisted.  I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, fucking fuck.  I miss you, fucking fuck.  DÐ²Ð¸Ð³ Lucius, I'm so fucking mad.  I love you, Twisted.  Please, fucking call me.  Please, fucking call me.  Please. 
[03:30:30]  I just want to know, why my toys sticky?  And my shoes, they keep sticking to me.  Why? Why is my toy sticky?  Okay, terrific.  Toy sticky.  I love the line where he goes, I grab the kid's toy and I wipe my dick off.  I wipe my dick with it.  That's great.  It could have been mixed a little bit better, though, don't you think?  It's kind of a mixed.  You've got to look at the producer on that.  You just want to listen to it.  I think we got it on that one. 
[03:31:00]  Let's call it a night.  I think we're going to just do one take today.  Tax Cunts from Whack Bag.  Break this CD.  So this is what Rogan listens to.  Lieutenant Thompson from Whack Bag, we fucking get it.  Yeah, when it keeps going, it's like, oh, painful.  All right, well, there's a couple more tracks.  Why don't we just kind of give the people a sample, Anthony?  A little sample up to the chorus? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, why not?  This is called Closet.  I think about the past, and it hurts.  Just a little kid growing up in the church.  Fearing Jesus, believing in God.  Eight years old, and I knew I was on.  Staring at the other little boys in the class.  My mouth is dry.  My heart's beating fast.  A little monster rain.  Taking the leak. 
[03:32:00]  And every chance I get, you know I'm taking a peek.  They looking at me, so I turn away quick.  I can't get caught.  Staring down at their dicks.  I want to hold it in my hand, but I'm scared to try.  I want to put it in my mouth, and I don't know why.  Okay, next track.  These are all the things that I'm hoping to get.  Every single night, when I'm stroking my dick.  I'm real confused, but there's no one to tell.  I know my life is doomed, and I'm going to hell.  Cause I'm living in the closet.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  Yeah.  See, I'm living in the closet. 
[03:32:30]  Help me, I'm in the closet.  See, I'm living in the closet.  This is a Bostonian's worst nightmare.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  Black NK.  Cause I'm living in the closet.  Jesus.  Help me, I'm in the closet.  What happens next?  I'm sure it's really bad at 13.  We know how this is going to end.  The creepiest part of that is because my mouth is dry and my heart is beating fast.  Are you a real age? 
[03:33:00]  No, I just picture him looking at those cocks and he can't talk.  I'm going to hold it in my hand.  I'm sure at the 13 part, there's plenty of things that rhyme with sock, cock, mouth.  Things like that.  Real difficult writing style.  We don't need to know, do we?  I'd like to find out what happens.  I think maybe he discovers girls.  Maybe.  That's the twist?  Yeah.  Jim's looking for a left turn.  I don't even know how far in that was.  313.  Far in? 
[03:33:30]  About 8 inches?  All right, let me see.  Oh, no.  Somewhere is in here.  Let's see.  All right.  All right, let's try this.  We're number 13.  There's no one to tell.  I know my life is due.  And I'm going to hell.  Because I'm living in the closet.  All right.  Yeah, he's living in the closet.  So I'm living in the closet.  See, I'm living in the closet.  Help me, I'm in the closet.  See, I'm living in the closet.  My motherfucker!  I'm living in the closet.  Because I'm living in the closet. 
[03:34:00]  Here we go, boys and girls.  Help me, I'm in the closet.  I'm 13, and it's all getting worse.  I'm going through puberty, and this shit is a curse.  24-7, now I'm thinking about dick.  But I'm still a virgin, and it's making me sick.  I tried to get with this girl, just to try to get off.  But I started getting sick, and my dick stayed soft.  I knew that million girls wasn't meant to be.  I knew that fucking with that pussy wasn't meant for me.  I met this guy named Tim, who lived down the street.  I used to sneak in his house when his mind was asleep.  We used to suck dick and make love all night. 
[03:34:30]  I didn't even know if it was wrong, but it felt so right.  It was a secret that we vowed to keep.  The sex is really good, but the guilt ran deep.  The truth was, I was in love with a man.  And it was something that this world could never understand.  Because I'm living in the closet.  All right, are we done?  He gets laid.  I was on the right track, though.  I think you were wrong there.  We're done, right?  No, he discovered girls.  He did discover girls.  He didn't like it, though.  All right.  Apparently, Tim had some good dick.  How was I supposed to know? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Fade this out?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go.  He can't help but wonder what's going to happen next.  I wonder.  Could it be a dick in his hands?  Maybe he goes to college without grosses.  I think he's going to get cured.  Yeah.  Thank God his father left when he was a baby, right?  But I still refuse to drive.  Because this world ain't right with me. 
[03:35:30]  One day, me and Tim got caught.  Ain't the consequences worse than I thought.  My parents threw me out, and I got disowned.  Now it's me against the world, and I'm all alone.  They curse me out, and they call me a fag.  I left with all my clothes in a plastic bag.  I learned that streets can be cold and vile.  And believe me, if you're gay, then it's twice as wild.  I fought a lot.  I've been stabbed and shot.  Motherfuckers trying to kill me, because I don't like twat.  In no time, I learned to ride for mine. 
[03:36:00]  And not to give a fuck if you like my kind.  I'd rather be dead than be living a lie.  And I won't be a fag till the day that I die.  Somehow they got me not giving a fuck.  And I'm saying fuck the world, and I'm living it up.  Go living in the closet.  All right, all right, all right.  Yeah, living in the closet.  I wonder who caught him and Tim.  Because I don't like twat.  I know.  Who caught him and Tim?  And why'd they have to tell his folks?  There's three more tracks.  Paddle Tail.  What are the names? 
[03:36:30]  Well, the next one's called The Faggots.  The Faggots?  A little sitcom?  A little taste of The Faggots?  No.  Can you please put it in some other way?  That doesn't have much of a range, does it?  It's kind of a one-trick pony here.  It's Gangsta Fag, everyone.  I was fucking for a dick.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  Now I just finished fucking my man.  Now I'm living in the bed.  Put my dick in the...  Right out of the gate on that one.  Right out of the gate.  He finished fucking his man.  Now he's right there with his dick in his hand.  MC, cut to the chase.  Confusion has apparently ended.  The Notorious D.I.K.  Oh, wow.  That's how they spell it in the hood.  All right.  All right.  Now I'm laying in the bed with my dick in his hand.  He gets up and he says he's thirsty.  He's going to the store to get a 40-year-old eat. 
[03:37:30]  He kissed me and told me I'd be back.  I laid the fuck down and started taking a nap.  I passed the fuck out because I'm tired like a mother.  That's when I heard a scream and the car burning rough.  I grabbed my cat and I ran outside.  I saw my baby in the crap and they beating him down.  They had him outnumbered one to eight.  They calling him a fag and they kicking his face.  I put my cat in the back and they spit.  And I don't really care, give a fuck who I hit.  They jump in the car, now they run like bitches.  The dead motherfuckers just dug that ditch in.  Run from the baggots, run from the baggots. 
[03:38:00]  You know it's worth it.  You can't go back to the front.  Little Cypress Hill there.  Yeah.  Run from the baggots.  I guess you picked the wrong fucking bag the fuck with.  Run from the baggots, run from the baggots.  You're insane in the membrane.  Yeah, yeah.  Insane in the membrane.  I guess you picked the wrong fucking bag the gay bash.  I know who they are because I've seen them before.  And now you know it's time for me to settle the score. 
[03:38:30]  So I call my dogs and we hit the streets.  Figure out how to fuck the guy in ICU.  Is that what we get next?  And I'm rubbing his balls.  He's in life support and I dick him in the ass.  Is there a market for gay rap music?  I don't think so.  Remember Curtis from Caroline's?  He's a black waiter who's very gay and happy about it and was rapping too.  He had this idea a long time ago.  He never went through with it.  With all this time?  He was actually really good.  He did some of his lines.  He was fucking hilarious. 
[03:39:00]  I don't know if he ever pursued it.  All right.  What's next on the...  Well, we have one more, I guess.  It's called If You Want.  And then there's a song called Eminem.  They have a book out, The Down Low Brothers.  The Down Low Brothers.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  So I figured maybe this is their music.  For The Down Low Brothers.  They keep it on The Down Low.  Yeah, in The Down Low.  They act like they're straight, but they're actually gay.  And they go out and they have sex with each other.  And then, you know, in front of other people, they're with, you know, hot chicks and they're thugs.  Here's If You Want. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, that's a good beat.  Anybody want to guess what's the subject?  What's it called?  If You Want.  If You Want.  I'm in my ride, cruising down the street.  Got my system bumping to a Twisted GB.  It's early in the morning and I'm smoking a bud.  Mahoney is a fuck and I need me a stud.  I got this chick asking me for a ride. 
[03:40:00]  But I let her know quickly that I'm strictly dickly.  I said, I'm sorry, I can't help you, miss.  Because a faggot like G don't be fucking with fish.  She gets upset and she flipping me off.  Because a saggy-ass chicks don't be getting me all high.  I just laughed and I drove right by.  Because I don't give a fuck because I'm so, so high.  I think about this dude that I fucked last night.  And how his dick was big and his ass was tight.  Socking on my cock like a candy cane.  Rubbing on my balls and fucking down my brain.  I pulled out and I came in his mouth.  I put my clothes on and I broke the fuck out.  You keep it real because I know my type. 
[03:40:30]  Because a nigga like G left a Twisted Life.  I keep it real and you know my type.  A nigga like G left a Twisted Life.  So if your dick is big and your ass is tight.  And you can get with me and we gonna fuck all night.  I keep it real and you know my type.  A nigga like G left a Twisted Life.  So if your dick is big and your ass is tight.  And you can get with me and we gonna fuck all night.  I better find the guy.  Yeah, I think he's gonna get lucky.  Yeah.  I think he's gonna get lucky.  Fuck that shit. 
[03:41:00]  I ain't paid for ass.  I make a U and I'm about to go home.  That's when my boy told me you're gonna say you look funny.  He says he got some guys hanging at the house.  They're talking lots of shit like they can turn me out.  I asked if they were fine and he said hell yeah.  I meet a U-turn and told him I'll be there.  Rollin' on my G's now I'm on my way.  I stopped by the store to grab some Alizade.  Cause you know me, yo, I must come right.  And if I got a bug and I can fuck all night.  I keep it real and you know my type.  Cause somebody's probably just tuned in right now and they think that this is the station. 
[03:41:30]  Just listen to that.  Thanks the fag station.  And you can get with me and we gonna fuck all night.  I keep it real and you know my type.  We should have saved this for the first day that we're off premium.  My introduction to the rest of the XM Park one.  Yeah, I think that was the weakest of the four tracks.  Yeah, I'll agree.  Kind of ran out of steam there.  Eric did a good job figuring out which ones worked.  Yeah, they certainly, he certainly exhausts the subject matter on the first couple of tunes.  And there's a song about Eminem. 
[03:42:00]  Is it good, bad?  It's just trashing Eminem for no reason.  Cause Eminem don't...  For being straight?  Well he wants Eminem to trash him back.  Because that would give him some kind of notoriety.  Cause then people would listen to him.  Alright, well.  Very interesting show today.  Let's say hi to Jason in New Hampshire.  Jason, what's up?  Today I learned you don't ask Bernie Getz for five bucks or smash his CDs.  Yes.  Very educational.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in you might want to listen to the replay.  Bernie Getz loses his mind.  Pinchy, what's up? 
[03:42:30]  Hey guys, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, today I learned from Bernie that Hotel Rwanda was a comedy.  There you go.  We did learn that.  Ben's raw ass.  Always good to watch.  Hey.  I learned two things.  I learned that Alpi's upstairs neighbor has a wood floor.  And I also learned that Ramon's never seen a fucking dog's rib come apart like that.  Very good.  Don't punch him out.  He's doing the platoon, right?  Yeah, I know.  Alright, yes, Ben?  Billy in Miami this weekend. 
[03:43:00]  Miami Improv?  Yeah.  Miami Improv?  Yeah.  I saw Billy at Caroline's.  He killed.  If you're in the Miami area, go see Billy Burr at the Improv, okay?  Do we have a phone number?  No.  No.  Oh, no.  Do we know a street that it's on?  Oh, no.  Or if you're in Miami, just ride around and listen for the sounds of laughter.  That's the building.  Jesus, that was the worst plug we've ever given.  Improv.  This weekend.  Billy Burr.  Miami.  Good? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  That works.  I'm sorry we didn't give you a better plug, Billy.  No, I mean, come on.  After Bernie gets the plane, does it really mean the Miami Improv?  That was pretty scary, right?  It was a little scary.  That was great.  I feel honored to be here.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, man.  I learned on the show today that Norton doesn't like Tweaky.  E-B-E-B-E-B-E-B-E.  Punch it out, book.  All right.  I guess that's it for today.  Well.  But, Ben, I'm just reading instant feedback. 
[03:44:00]  The gay is back in the show.  A lot of people.  I learned that Marty Scorkeksi directed The Aviator.  Not many people knew that.  Do you think the gangsta fag asked to smell Tim's breath before they got it on?  No reference to, uh.  Oh, that was the reference when Jim was talking about.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Speak for the anemone show. </pre>
