<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly offensive rollercoaster of segments.  The show opened with a lengthy discussion of "Stalker Patty," a listener who exhibited obsessive behavior towards Opie, including sending his personal information to another stalker and attempting backstage access.  The hosts and Jim Norton graphically described Patty's appearance and recounted an incident involving her emotional distress and bodily functions.  A five-page apology letter from Patty was also discussed.  A caller from Dallas then phoned in, expressing his appreciation for the show despite its late broadcast time in his area, prompting a discussion about the challenges of airing at an unusual hour. This was followed by a caller recounting his girlfriend leaving him after he attempted a sexual maneuver called the "balloon knot."

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a comedic bit featuring "Dice Bop" music and a poem about Dice Clay, punctuated by numerous crude and offensive jokes.  R. Lee Ermey, guest in studio, discussed his experience as a drill instructor, his acting career, and his views on the military action following the World Trade Center attacks.  Ermey's commentary was peppered with strong language and comedic interjections from the hosts.

The next segment began with a discussion of a *Full Metal Jacket* action figure with conflicting age ratings.  This transitioned into clips demonstrating the deteriorating mental state of recurring guest Buddy Epson, shown through increasingly erratic performances of "Well, Doggies."  A 7-Eleven prank call using *Full Metal Jacket* lines followed, filled with vulgar and sexually suggestive language. A listener then sang a graphic and offensive song about his divorce.  Opie's pumpkin picking experience with his girlfriend, Sandy, was then discussed, escalating into a prolonged, offensive series of pranks and insults from the hosts and callers, culminating in Sandyâ€™s own irate call-in.

The show then played a profanity-laced rant by Earl Weaver, followed by a call with Ozzy Osbourne, who discussed his new album, family, and experiences. A further tech support prank call, also containing profanity, concluded this segment.  Two female police officers were present in studio, engaging in a playful arrest skit with the hosts.  Throughout this segment, rampant use of offensive language, including homophobic slurs, was present.

A nearly unintelligible phone interview with Ozzy Osbourne, conducted while he was reportedly in a limousine en route to a helicopter, followed.  The hosts and callers emphasized the absurdity of the situation and Ozzy's mumbled speech, with jokes revolving around the word "helicopter," and speculation about his intoxication level. A caller then described a Nevada escort service, leading to a humorous exchange about unusual requests.  The hosts subsequently discussed a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia auction, focusing on the high prices of her bikinis and speculating about their odors. Anthony imitated Marilyn Monroe's voice. A fictional Bob Hope phone call from space, filled with ageist and crude jokes, followed.

Adam Ferrara (from *The Job*) was a guest in studio.  The hosts engaged in banter about Ferrara's career, including offensive jokes about ethnicity.  A call from an advertising agency led to a conversation about the show's syndication and the caller's sexual orientation and appearance.  An improvised Family Feud-style game about Louie Anderson's alleged sexual encounters with young men ensued, with sexually explicit and homophobic comments. A man claiming to be Louie Anderson himself then called in.

A listener complained about jokes previously made about anthrax, prompting an offensive rant from the hosts, filled with ethnic slurs.  A prank call recording from the CD *May I Help You, Dumbass* (featuring a Jimmy Stewart impersonator offering absurd tech support) was then played.  The show concluded with a segment featuring Jim Brewer, a caller recounting his show experience, leading to sexually explicit and homophobic remarks from the hosts and callers.  Brewer's wife then called in, expressing anger and disappointment.

Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday  Talking about y'all will never come to Dallas  Why not, man?  Well, we're on in the middle of the night  It's because y'all are on a tool of a station here  No, we're on in the middle of the night in Dallas  So it's kind of tough to do anything for Dallas  I know  That's the only thing that sucks, man  Because I work at another radio station here in Dallas 
[00:01:30]  And I work in the daytime  And I caught you guys one night, man  And I got hooked, man  And I was like  I'm up till 2 in the morning every night  Trying to catch you guys, man  That is so weird that we're on 10P to 2A somewhere  Yeah, because they would rather bring in  See, what happened is, let me tell you  It's a station down here  Does anyone else care in America, though  What you're about to say?  No, I'm just asking, seriously  I'm a big Cowboy fan, dude  I'm a big Cowboy fan  And we'll go to Dallas  I think when the Cowboys win two games in a row 
[00:02:00]  Craig, thanks for the support, though  We appreciate you  Hey, man, I love you guys, man  I'm still listening every night  All right, thank you  Till then  Till y'all get a better shot, man  Holler  All right, peace!  Yeah  All right, we have lots to do  We have a letter from Stalker Patty  Apologizing for her actions  On the show the other day  Do you see how lunatic this woman is?  This is what mental patients do  To pull you back in 
[00:02:30]  Yes  They make you feel sorry for them  And then, you know, you realize you're a human being  And then you're like  Okay, I'm sorry  And then they're close to you again  I was shaking  And, well, we could read this  It's about a five-page letter  Oh, my God  And in the letter she talks about  There's no punctuation  No, in the letter she talks about being an ant  Which is pretty interesting  Being an ant  Oh, yeah, it's really  You know  No, she thinks she's an insect  Yeah  Well, it was a while back  I believe it was Norton, right?  That said, this woman has the body of an ant 
[00:03:00]  She is  She's very frail and fragile looking  And her body is very ant-like  And we've been goofing on her about that  Now she's acknowledging it in her letter  She's referring to herself as an ant  Yeah, you want to get everyone up to speed  About what happened the other day  Not the whole Patty story  Oh, I know  Because that's a nightmare  Patty's just basically a stalker of this program  And of Opie more so  Thank God  No joking  She really is a stalker  People are like  Ha ha, a little radio bit 
[00:03:30]  I hear this stuff on the morning zoo all the time  But what makes her a scary stalker  Is she can lift ten times her body weight  Right, very scary  Right  A stalker doesn't have to be the person  That shows up at your door with a gun  It's preferable  But it doesn't have to be  And Patty is a type of stalker  And we learned stalkers stick together  So there's a stalker in Chicago  Yeah  Who decided to mail stalker Patty all my personal info  And I was taking care of it behind the scenes 
[00:04:00]  But Patty decided to tell my girlfriend  And she lost her ass at the Beacon Theater  Which made for a nightmare of a night  So then I lost it on Patty the other day  Not only that though  But Patty at the Beacon Theater  Was all pissed off and upset that she couldn't get backstage  Meanwhile it wasn't our gig  It was Jane Moore's  She was complaining to certain people  Like looking at people that were backstage  And going  I saw people I didn't know back there  I've been involved at the show for quite a while  Why?  Why am I being treated like this? 
[00:04:30]  Four fists waving in the air  Yeah, she's more concerned about  People she doesn't know being backstage  And wants to know why they're backstage  Tiny abdomen shaking back and forth  Hanging from that little thread-like thing  Between the thorax and the abdomen  And that little hair-like whiskery piece of material  That is just too thin to support life  I never realized how it worked  But on Patty it's just shaking back and forth  Why?  Right, so  She was  I have something real quick  She was standing just outside the entrance to the dressing room 
[00:05:00]  And she looked at me and said  They're not letting me go up there  So I said  I don't know Patty  I was standing there with six people that I brought with me  That were members of the union that I worked with  They're very important people  This one guy resembled Keith the cop  He resembles him  Mind you  I mean you look at him  You know it's not Keith the cop  She stood there staring at him going  Keith  Keith  Keith  And the guy didn't answer  The guy was like  Who is this 
[00:05:30]  Why isn't Keith  Paying attention  I'm one of the family  She was frightening, man  Loony  Hey, what's this white powder in the envelope?  Oh, dog  Even  It's probably dandruff from her pubic hair  Worse than anthrax  She addresses the whole  Trying to get backstage at the Jay Moore show at the Beacon  And other things  We left it with basically making Soccer Patty cry  We're not proud of ourselves 
[00:06:00]  But that's what happened  No, no  Cry is too nice a word for what she was doing  We told her to get lost  She was like bawling, hysterical  Like when you see in the movie  They tell somebody that somebody they love just died  That's how she's crying  And as per Mary  Our intern  She released fluids on herself  She was so upset  There's no 100% guarantee with that  But she smelled very, very funny  She smelled like someone that was at the Friars Club  Right, like the best diaper 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, exactly  No, because we asked you to  She was so upset and losing it  That we said, Mary, please bring her to the bathroom  So she could kind of freshen up and get herself together  She didn't  What did we do?  She didn't do anything  She was upset and you guys were laughing  So I went and earned the good of mine at heart  All right, that's fine  Why are you making fun of me?  All it was was the fluid we used to bond the larvae together 
[00:07:00]  In the chamber so they hatch  It has a urine-like scent to it  It's how we keep the walls up in our holes  I don't understand  She was shaking  I mean, shaking to the point  Where she couldn't walk from the bathroom to the studio  Like she was holding on to me  You know, they do that just before they attack  Yeah, they shake  They do shake  And they come out of everywhere  With those huge mandibles  The junk  And what is that  We're not proud statement  We're not very proud of that 
[00:07:30]  You were very happy with that  I've never seen Opie so pleased  I was just trying to redeem myself  Because the email I got the next day  Oh, yeah  Usually email doesn't get to me  Some of it was boring  I should have read some of that in the air  One of them was from Cindy Williams  She was really big  Yeah  And because of the Patty incident  I shredded my vocal cords, by the way  Yeah  Because of this  Jump  Literally shredded them  Where I might have to go to  Like a throat specialist  That's like Muslim rape  My voice hurts so much  That's Muslim rape 
[00:08:00]  Every time I talk now  Yeah, that is Muslim rape  Muslim rape  Picture the flags burning  They're chanting  All the beards  Filthy animals in the streets  And then they're yelling  Shut up  Yeah  I can see it  There's not a lot of distortion in that  By the way  That was my voice  Going past what your vocal cords  Are supposed to do  One more time  Let's hear it  Shut up  Okay 
[00:08:30]  Yeah  So Mary  When she walked Patty to the bathroom  She came running back in saying  Hey man  Patty relieved herself  She smells like you know  Number one  Right  Like she did a number one on herself  While weeping  That's not what Mary said exactly  Mary came back with her hand out  And said  Smell my fingers  And who didn't  Usually that's high  But everyone did  Yeah  Until you realize  Smell my fingers  It was Patty  Alright well  I will hand over the letter to Anthony 
[00:09:00]  So he can read it as Stalker Patty  This is the  Okay  Latest installment of the soap opera  That is Stalker Patty  Yeah  Just listen for the guilt  Here it is  You're trying to guilt me  And this is what mental patients do  They give you the guilt  And then you invite them back into the  Into the fold  Whiskey  Oh wait  We need some  We need some music before you  Before you read the letter  Oh play that sad walking away song  From the Incredible Home  Oh and I and company 
[00:09:30]  This is in response to Monday's episode  In the studio  Please cut me a little slack  You're judging me kind of harshly  My life has been turned upside down  In the span of less than a week  And I had to move an entire room into storage  Pack my bags  Leave a place that was an illegal rental  That I didn't know about  Under an immediate eviction 
[00:10:00]  Finding myself suddenly homeless overnight  And scrambling for temporary lodging  Trying to relocate to a new home  What does that have to do with anything  With no money  And continue  There has not been a period yet  And continuing to work my two jobs  Without taking any time off  You're wearing no punctuation either  Oh my god 
[00:10:30]  They put me at the bottom of the hive  Where I have to gnaw through solid rock  To see the light of day  Now she goes  On top of that  The two crooks I rented from  For three months  With no lease  Were threatening me over the phone at work  Because they wanted more money from me 
[00:11:00]  One was a blue odd hog  They're trying to get more money from her  She'll pay it  Distortion  Is part of this letter now  Right  Last night I found a place  I actually signed a lease  And made arrangements  To tag on an extra to the rent  To make up  For a security deposit 
[00:11:30]  First page  I just flipped over  Nothing about anything  But her problems  Finding a place to live  Well that's what they do though man  And now  Some of the stress  I've been carrying  Is beginning to go away  As problems get solved  All this was happening  In the span of a couple of days  With no mental preparation  Of warning  And not knowing  What was going to happen next  Plus I was alone 
[00:12:00]  With my situation  Fending for myself  With literal  No help from others  In the colony  With no help from others  In an unforeseen situation  That just  Heaped itself on me  Some of that  Bottled up stress  Expressed itself  On Sunday night  I know I should  Not have gotten  So upset  When I wasn't allowed  Upstairs  After the show  I'd been 
[00:12:30]  Dealing with a huge  Situation all week  And merely  Wanted some  Company  In a festive  Atmosphere  That would take me  Away from my circumstances  For a couple of minutes  Shut up  Because I was not  A stranger  To some people  Upstairs  I didn't think  It was a problem  To come up  And mingle a little  Maybe I needed 
[00:13:00]  Some people  To be with me  At the moment  And felt frustrated  That  I could not  Have a couple of minutes  To escape my situation  There's the guilt  There's the guilt  She just wanted  To come back  Have a little companionship  As for issues  Concerning the  Correspondence  From Chicago  It was an error  In judgment  On my part  I'd been  Concerned about it 
[00:13:30]  Since I handed it  And it was  An additional worry  On top of what  I suddenly  Found myself  Going through  A couple of days  Before  And maybe  Someone from the show  Could have  Reassured me  That I was  Okay  And being  Handled  I would not  Have felt the need  To mention it  To the wrong  Person  By mistake  On my part  Sometimes 
[00:14:00]  Silence  And no feedback  Can increase  My anxiety  And might  Give me an impression  That it's worse  Than it was  I merely  Wanted  To know  The status  Of the letter  And what happened  With it  I didn't realize  It was not  Good to tell  Sandy 
[00:14:30]  She was the first  One I saw  And I asked  About it  On impulse  As a lot  Of  Bagages  On my mind  That was one  Concern  I needed  To be relieved  From  I had never  Gotten a letter  Like this  The floor 
[00:15:00]  Can laughter  Always funny  Sorry  Go ahead  And with no  Prior experience  I didn't know  What to think  Of this  I felt  I needed  To ask  Anyone  Please be fair  To me  I've done  Nothing wrong  That I can see  In a technical  Way  I've just  Been reacting  To stressful  Situations 
[00:15:30]  That have been  Forced on me  Walk it off  Dink  Stuff I didn't ask  For a plan for  I admit my behavior  Wasn't the  Be more funny  As for a  Correspondence  From Chicago  Direct anger 
[00:16:00]  Toward him  Or her  They may have  Done something  Illegal  Harassment  Be it a letter  Or a phone  Hang up  It's against  The law  She knows that  Who is this  Person  And why  Did they do  This to begin  With  I'm losing  My  Circle  Tees  Yeah baby

[00:22:30]  I  That  Is  The  Best  Thing  Is  That  What  It  Was  If  You're  Loud  Enough  And  Threatening  Enough  Yes  I  Will  Be  Intimidated  Enough  Is that what you did?  He intimidated you and yelled at you and you wound up going all over yourself.  Well, yeah, I did.  I couldn't help it. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't even know it until I left and came back.  Well, everyone else knew.  Everyone else knew.  You must be taking vitamins or something.  When the ad feels threatened, it secretes a must.  You know, you get kind of scary.  You really do.  Shut up.  Wait a minute.  I'm getting warmer in my crotch.  By the way, Tom, yes, Norton is on the floor rolling around.  Norton, you want to get off the floor?  Norton's like a skunk, man.  She tried to spray you in self-defense. 
[00:23:30]  That's one of my superpowers that a super lady has.  I'm not super lady.  Actually, I am super lady.  And what I do, one of my defenses when one of those super villains come is I wet myself  and the smell chases him away.  Just because you're super lady, you don't have to behave like Christopher Reeve since the accident.  Super lady.  Flying away on her maxi pad.  Very funny.  You're a mess.  How bad did you leave yourself? 
[00:24:00]  Not that bad, but I did.  It was enough.  It was enough.  Now, Patty, since you didn't have a place to live, where did you shower?  Well, I stayed at friends' places over the last five days.  I stayed on...  Super friends?  Yeah, I had a couple friends on Staten Island.  They let me stay overnight.  And, uh...  I made my home in the North Pole.  It's a big frozen yellow castle.  Well, guess how I make it.  I don't know how. 
[00:24:30]  Super lady flies high above the North Pole, and I listen Oprah yell at me, and as I wet  myself, it lands on the icy mist below.  Gigantic yellow ice castle.  And the smell keeps the villains out.  Well, anyway, I think I did a very good job for myself getting a place within three days,  and...  Shut up, dummy.  ...set to move in Thursday.  And if Elpy really scares me, I'm going to put a brown roof on the whole thing.  Super lady. 
[00:25:00]  Super lady.  Where the hell did you get that?  All right.  Super lady.  The emaciated mess.  Flying through the air.  Girls leaking themselves.  Always funny.  Cleverly disguised as a 45-year-old virgin.  That'll be a good one that I learned.  Girls leaking themselves.  Always funny.  You know, I think I owe Mary, the intern, an apology.  I thought she was exaggerating.  I'm like, there's no way that this happened. 
[00:25:30]  The yes is dead, and I didn't know it until late.  Shut up.  She just wet herself again.  Opie's like her nemesis.  It's like kryptonite.  Opie's yell just makes her relieve her function.  It's like kryptonite.  Wow.  Oh, no.  A good hit with kryptonite.  I wish I had that power.  You were right.  Yes, you were right.  I didn't know for sure or not, so I was right.  No, you were right.  Oh, my goodness.  I thought you were exaggerating. 
[00:26:00]  Lex Opie.  It's a bird-like body.  It's a plain-looking woman.  No, it's super lady.  Powers beyond that, immortal women.  I can wet myself.  Don't worry.  I'll swoop down on the villains and level them with my yellow fluid.  Flying on the wings of a maxi.  Flying on my big wings of a maxi pad. 
[00:26:30]  I fly over the villain and...  ...yourself on them.  Can you breathe my mind?  My hymen is like lead.  I don't know what kind of Superman tie in that is.  But no one's sure it.  No one's seeing through it.  It's a super lady.  It's a super lady.  You're going to love it.  She is never a disappointment. 
[00:27:00]  Super lady stinks.  Dude, we've got to get her a suit.  Literally.  It's around Christmas time.  We've got to get her a suit for the Philly show.  A cape and a diaper.  A super lady.  A cape and a diaper.  And then Opie can yell at her on stage and she can wet herself.  Price of admission.  I thought we were reenacting the carry scene with the soccer pad.  Oh, are we going to put her in a gown and dump pig blood on her head?  No, this is better.  After talking it up like she's going to be the queen of the prom.  Don't laugh at you. 
[00:27:30]  Look at your dirty pillows are showing.  I don't have any dirty pillows.  We've got to get a Supergirl outfit for her.  My hairy pillows are showing.  My hairy pillows.  That's what they got.  Looks like the stuffing's coming out.  I better write some gear with speed to a fish and kick you.  Nice.  All right, we have to take a break.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. 
[00:28:00]  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:28:30]  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Got to get to a couple phone calls here.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Not much, man.  Listen, I got a little story for you.  Yeah.  Well, see, me and my girlfriend were having sex the other night.  And I've been seeing her for about a year. 
[00:29:00]  And she never lets me go for the balloon knot.  Right.  So I'm going.  That came in perfectly.  She never lets me go for the balloon knot.  Wow.  I'm going to try it.  You know, she's really against it.  She doesn't want to do it.  So I think, you know, you don't knock until you try it.  Right.  So I go for it.  Oh, wow.  And...  Fighting is everything, man. 
[00:29:30]  She gave you the fish eye.  She gave you the fish eye?  Yeah.  Do you want to explain the fish eye, Anthony?  The fish eye is when you're going at it normal in the dog-like fashion, let's say.  And then in one move during withdrawal, you now are going back.  And instead of the regular way, you go into the balloon knot.  Which is a big surprise for the lady. 
[00:30:00]  Very big surprise.  She will turn her head around and look at you over her shoulder with an eye that looks like the fish's eye.  Like a fish eye.  Like a garami.  Or a flounder or something.  Just gazing at you.  Black eye.  Lifeless eye.  Like a doll's eye.  Well, she let out a yell like a chihuahua, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You got it.  You got it.  Well, she dumped me.  She dumped you because you went for that move? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, she knew how...  She dumped you because you dumped her hair.  I slept on in that one insta steam charge.  Well, she dumped me, man.  And I'm real worried about it.  I know she listens to your show.  And I just...  I want to...  Jess, if you're out there, just call up the show or something.  I miss you.  Baby, come back.  I didn't mean to stick you there.  Baby, come back.  I was wrong.  Well, trying to stick you there. 
[00:31:00]  That's right.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, I got a little six-line poem here about stuff's been going on on the show.  You want to hear it?  Oh!  Oh.  Oh, one of these scat.  Hey.  It's really good and it'll all go through.  Yeah, we love poems.  There was a dick named Dice Clay.  Technical virgin, he was twice today. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, boy.  You lost me already.  No, I'm enjoying this.  Caskets and nails and pieces and kennison.  Down at the station house, he was a denison.  Sam, Bernie gets Dice Clay.  Bag of yam, get the nets.  Nice.  What'd you think?  Silent game. 
[00:32:00]  Always effective.  Always effective.  Always effective.  Dice is the new thing.  He goes,  Bump!  He'll say something and then just go,  Bump!  Bump!  Oh, yeah.  Bump, bump, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Oh!  Bump!  I like the little kid on the drums.  He plays like me.  Oh!  Bump!  Now it's mine.  Mine now.  Bump!  Bump!  We got together some bop songs for you, Dice Bop. 
[00:33:00]  We got together some bop songs for you, Dice Bop.  Yeah!  What's this one?  Oh, my.  This is off your new album, Dice Bop.  Dice Bop.  I know this one.  I bop, you bop, you bop, you bop, and they bop. 
[00:33:30]  We bop, she bop, and we bop.  Hey, this is the broad that was singing the other night.  City Laugh.  City Laugh.  Yeah.  This is about jerking.  Yeah!  Where's the nicest part?  It's coming up.  Here it is.  Almost there. 
[00:34:00]  Dice Bop!  Dice Bop!  Dice Bop!  Do we ever listen to this kind of music?  No.  No, no.  We're almost there.  It's kind of a far way to go.  This is the music you'll just do when you really want to get laid.  No, I like it.  Boom, she bop. 
[00:34:30]  Bop.  Who said bop to what?  She bop.  He bop, and we bop.  Dice Bop.  You bop, and they bop.  Norton Bops.  Bops on a candy bops.  Jay Moore Bops.  Happy face bops.  You bop.  All right.  Maybe that one didn't work as well.  Dice.  That was a little long to get to.  Didn't you have the end available? 
[00:35:00]  Can't we queue it up?  Oh, no.  I hated this song.  I always hated this song.  This song made me violent.  Isn't this awful?  This is the...  Made me violent.  This is the so-tail end of this friggin' music.  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  What's got you so jumpin'?  Hey, what's got you so jumpin'?  Yeah! 
[00:35:30]  Bop!  I can't wait for the bops no more.  I'm crazy!  Bop!  I feel dirty right now.  I feel dirty right now.  This is if you're dirty.  I'm skinny bop! 
[00:36:00]  I'm skinny bop-bop!  I'm skinny bop-bop-bop!  I'm skinny bop!  I ain't talkin' to you no more!  Bop!  You said you're so funny!  All right, that almost worked.  Okay.  We'll try one more.  I bop!  You bop!  I'd like to thank the guy who wrote the song. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah?  I made my baby fall in love with me.  Who put the bop in the bop-bop-bop?  Who put the bop in the bop-bop-bop?  Who put the bop in the bop-bop-bop?  Who put the dip in the dip-dip-dip-dip-bop?  What the hell is this?  You're gonna make me explode!  He made my baby fall in love with me. 
[00:37:00]  How's that for tell?  When my baby heard...  I've read enough of the bop.  Rick, did you have to bring in your entire CD collection?  Really?  One after the other.  Pick it up, it's my new album, Dice Bob!  Or bop with dice!  Bop in with dice.  Bop in with dice.  That's great.  When he'd just come out with that.  Bop!  It almost worked. 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  Hey, for effort.  What's up, guys?  Look at us trying to do a pin and it didn't work.  We suck.  I'm in traffic and I have to roll up my windows because it looked like I'm insane.  Well, that's another part of the bit.  We crank up lousy music and you gotta roll your windows up real quick.  That sucks.  You gotta cue that up every time Dice gives out a bop.  Yeah, next time he does his bop, we'll have that music ready for him.  Bop music. 
[00:38:00]  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop music!  Talk about bop music!  Bop!  Bop!  Wasn't that the band M?  Yep.  Wow, look at you.  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Oh, very impressive, but you're just a faggy from my days when I had to spin that crap.  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop music!  Everybody's talking about bop music.  Oh, yeah.  All around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel. 
[00:38:30]  The weasel thought it was lots of fun.  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  Bop!  I think every time Brewer comes in, I get a contact target.  We get really silly when you get in here.  I mean, I just want my friends, I told my wife, I just want to go hang out and just giggle.  Right.  Why not?  Well, then don't do it.  Uh-oh.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, I'll be in Anthony's show.  Yeah, what's up, Dice?  How you doing? 
[00:39:00]  All right.  I'm just talking, you know.  Yeah.  I want to contribute to the show.  Okay.  Bop!  I saw that coming.  Got him.  Yeah, that was smart.  Got you.  Now the big boss is going to get abused for now.  Oh, stop!  Way to be, Dick.  Heh heh.  Heh heh.  Jesus Christ.  It's a madhouse! 
[00:39:30]  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all we need!  Whatever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  With Drowning Pool Bodies.  I gotta tell you, I feel really bad for Drowning Pool.  Oh, yeah.  They had so much heat. 
[00:40:00]  A lot of momentum going for them.  This was one of the hottest songs in America.  Every alternative rock, modern rock, even regular rock stations were jamming this song.  Yeah.  And then the World Trade Center thing happened, and every radio station dropped this song from  their playlist.  And it had nothing to do with...  Well, the song's about moshing.  Right.  But, you know...  But I guess it was too close to what was going on.  Exactly.  So, everyone dropped the record, and Drowning Pool just basically went away. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, horrible break for these guys.  Them and Anthrax having a tough time with it.  Them and Anthrax.  They put a little statement on their website, Anthrax, saying that they won't be changing  their name.  Originally, they made a joke, like, yeah, they were going to change it to Basket Full of  Puppies.  But then they said, no, we're not going to change it.  You know, not because it's a big pain in the ass, but because we're just hoping that  nothing else bad happens, and this whole thing just goes away. 
[00:41:00]  I'm not worried about the Anthrax.  You're not?  Nah.  It's not contagious.  Not from person to person.  It's not contagious.  Frank Caliendo?  Yes, me.  Not from person to person, but, hey, you know, you get some of that wacky stuff on you.  Frank Caliendo in the studio.  We're going to get to him in a sec.  I mean, jump in whenever you want, Frank, but we've got to interrupt your appearance  for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Nice.  Arlie.  Arnie.  Right here.  Sergeant Hartman.  How are we doing today? 
[00:41:30]  How are you?  We're just sitting here wondering how I can get involved in this conversation that's going  on here about Anthrax.  Yeah.  You dig the Anthrax, Sergeant Hartman?  I don't think it's a threat.  The only way it could possibly be a threat is if they feed it, if they infect the animals  and we eat the beef.  Right.  You know, then it's a threat.  But, good Lord, I mean, who's going to go?  It's got to be, it goes up your nose.  Right.  It has to be an airborne germ. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Mr. Arnie?  And it's not.  I just wanted to say, this is Jim Norton, my friend Happy Face and I are big fans, and  I just look at your doll and it inspires me.  Yeah, you have an action figure.  Oh, do you guys have the doll?  Oh, we have it right there.  We can't play any of its sounds on the air.  Well, you know, it's kind of rough.  I like it.  A little rough around the edges, but, you know, a drill instructor, that's the way the drill  instructor talks.  Hell, exactly.  I love it.  Hell, he can't talk if he can't swear. 
[00:42:30]  I love it.  Hey, sir, what is your current location in Afghanistan right now?  You know, I volunteered to go back in uniform.  I really did.  You did.  And, you know, let's be realistic, I'm 57 years old.  I wouldn't be worth a damn on the field of battle.  However, I'm a great motivator.  I think you'd make bin Laden, you know, leak his pants.  Well, I would just have to, I would love to go around and just keep the troops motivated.  How long were you a DI for?  I was a drill instructor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in 1965, 6, and 7. 
[00:43:00]  And you did one and a half tours of Vietnam.  I did just over one tour in Vietnam.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But I was in the rear with the gear.  The only, we had, we would take a CAC platoon out occasionally to a village.  And, you know, we didn't really get real too serious about fighting the war.  We took rockets.  Really?  So don't, don't, don't even, I'm not a hero.  We want to, we want to get that across right off the bat. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  You're a hero in the movies, though.  I got hurt.  You are inspiring.  I got hurt getting in the bunker, guys.  Oh, you're killing us by telling us this stuff.  No, it's fine.  I know you love this mission of Audie Murphy charging up the hill, but it doesn't work.  So we'll just keep it, keep it down to earth today.  I hate seeing Superman without his cape.  You're like the manliest man.  I don't want to hear this crap.  Well, I'm a famous drill instructor is what I am. 
[00:44:00]  And that's what I did most of my time in the Marine Corps was I taught people things.  And I was an instructor and I was a very good instructor.  And that's what I, I, I like to draw from when I do film.  How'd you get, how'd you get to make the, uh, the transition into movies?  Somebody must have seen you and thought, oh my God, this guy's the definitive drill instructor.  See, you make it sound real goddamn simple.  See, the deal is here, is you have, if you decide this is something you want to do, 
[00:44:30]  you have to make sure that you're seen.  Number one, you don't, just don't accidentally get seen around here.  No.  So there you go.  But anyway, we made it happen.  How do you get seen?  You stand out on the corner.  You are a disgusting fat body.  You know, what do you do?  No, I was, uh, I had, uh, we were doing Vietnam.  They started doing Vietnam war shows in the Philippines.  And I just happened to be there.  And so I, I started doing technical advice. 
[00:45:00]  So I was, I kind of had a, my foot in the door.  What is a Vietnam war show?  A movie.  Oh, they were doing a movie in the Philippines.  Yeah.  And, uh, you, you got your foot in the door?  After I was retired.  Okay.  I went, I was single.  So I said, hell, I'm not really too happy about hanging around here.  You went to the Philippines to find a bride.  Uh, I went to the, I actually went to the Philippines to, uh, to party.  Yeah.  And, and I, uh, had to make money while I was partying so that I could party. 
[00:45:30]  Although I was retired from the Marine Corps, so I was getting a small check.  You get one taste of those women over there and, uh, the American women just don't cut it anymore?  Is that it?  Well, you know how it is.  I, I, I just, everybody has their little style of women.  Me so hawny.  You like that?  And I had to have one with a, a flat head and a butt that sticks up.  So, so I could put the ashtray on their head.  And, and, uh, rest my beer on her butt.  I like it.  You're the greatest man alive. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, I wasn't particular.  It could have been just any race.  Right.  It just, I decided I'd start looking in the Philippines.  Can I ask a question?  What I want?  Because the dialogue was so brilliant in Full Metal Jacket.  How much of that did you add?  Or how much did, did Kubrick and the writers put in?  Uh, uh, when I got there, the first half of that film stunk.  Trust me.  Really?  Modest.  And I told Stanley, when Stanley called me on the phone, I told him, Stanley, he asked  me, he says, have you, have you read The Short Timers, Gustav Ashford's novel, The Short 
[00:46:30]  Timers?  I'm basing a film on that.  And, and what do you think of the, the, the book?  And I said, well, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, funny, Stanley, but I, I, it's just laced with  fictitious bull crap.  Right.  And Stanley, right away, I had Stanley's attention.  And he, and so I came over and he and I sat down and actually rewrote the first half of  the show.  Yeah, that, that was brilliant.  Too bad you didn't, uh, rewrite the second half of the, uh, movie. 
[00:47:00]  Well, you know, it's, uh, it's, it's like it just loses its momentum after you leave bootcamp  because bootcamp is really a tough act to follow.  Let's face it, guys.  You should have been out there in the field just giving them hell.  The whole movie was you.  It was all, you know, that's like porno for guys watching Full Metal Jacket.  The first air is phenomenal.  Oh, well, thank you.  I don't know.  Is that a compliment?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's questionable, you know.  Yes.  Totally straight.  I did do a show. 
[00:47:30]  I am getting a few little remarks because I did do a show earlier that was released earlier  this year called Saving Silverman where I kissed Jack Black.  Right.  Yeah.  We had Jack in here yesterday.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  How does it kiss?  Very, very kissable, isn't he?  He's a cute little guy.  You know, when they told me I was going to kiss Jack Black, I said, you know, I couldn't  think of anybody I'd rather kiss.  Really?  I had done a show with Jack Black with Sean Penn and it was called Dead Man Walking, right? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And Jack Black was one of Sean Penn's brothers in Dead Man Walking.  Did you put him on his knees and make him choke himself?  No, no.  As a matter of fact, I played the role of a homicidal gay high school football coach in  this show.  Yeah.  Nice.  So, you see, it was a very good comedy, I thought.  Very slapstick.  It was like Three Stooges comedy.  Did you slip them the tongue? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, no.  No tongue, no wet.  No, no.  That's good.  No benefits, no extras, no ups, no downs.  It's like I told him, if I feel anything stiffening up, it's over with, buddy.  So, anyway, Jack and I really got along great.  How many people do that, just come up to you and start quoting your lines from movies?  You know, everybody, every guy in America knows them. 
[00:49:00]  I go to, I can't go out anymore without being, you know, everybody knows me.  Sure.  And, but my guys are all, my fans, the people that like what I do are all gentlemen.  Yeah.  You see, they come up and introduce themselves and then they excuse themselves after they  make a comment or say hello.  So, and, so that makes it, life is still enjoyable.  Nobody wants a lock of my hair.  They're not, yeah, mugging you on the street. 
[00:49:30]  What do you think of this whole situation?  What's your take on this military action we're engaged in?  The World Trade Center needs to be, there needs to be retaliation and, you know, I've been  sitting here, I've been sitting here watching the terrorists grow and grow from the old days  back in Gaddafi all the way up to what it is now and these terrorists have grown leaps  and bounds and if we don't stop them here, we're not going to be able to stop them. 
[00:50:00]  God damn it.  The thing that worries me most about this situation is if it becomes a holy war, then  it is a problem.  So we had best watch our public relations and we had best treat those people properly over  there and, and go in and win the hearts and minds of the people.  We're, we're feeding them.  We're trying to feed the, the, the good people and we're trying to be very surgical about  when we hit the country and we're trying desperately not to hurt anybody that is not Taliban. 
[00:50:30]  Jesus H. Christ, coming from you, that's fantastic.  You got anything left in your voice to give us a little something there?  I've always got some.  Can you like work in, uh...  Would you like the first scene?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay, I got to close the door here.  Okay, here it comes.  You ready?  All right.  Here it goes.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I am your senior drill instructor. 
[00:51:00]  From now on, you will speak only when spoken to.  That first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be, sir.  Do you maggots understand that?  Sir, yes, sir.  Bulls, I can't hear you.  Cut off like you've got a pair.  Sir, yes, sir.  If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training,  you will be a weapon.  You will be a minister of death praying for war.  But until that day, you are pukes.  You are scumbags. 
[00:51:30]  You are the lowest form of life on earth.  You are not even human.  See, it gets dirty.  God damn.  I got the chills, my friend.  Boy, that guy yelling at you.  Isn't that great?  Oh, I love it.  Poetry.  See, I'm all worn out.  Are you going to pass out?  Well, I'm a non-smoker, and I humped the golf course every morning carrying my bag.  I'm actually in pretty good shape, guys.  I went down, and the commanding officer over at 3rd Ladd Battalion up at Camp Pendleton called me 
[00:52:00]  and asked me if I'd come down and go on a six-mile force night march with him and the troops to motivate them.  And I thought, oh, boy, these guys are going to walk my butt off.  Right.  Actually, I led off, and they were huffing and puffing by the time I got them back up the hill to camp.  Could you imagine, though?  You look around, you turn around, and it's him.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  The guys must have been very happy.  Well, once we got back, once we got, because I just had a cup of drink, but once we got back up on the hill, we then bivouacked. 
[00:52:30]  And guess what?  There was about five kegs of beer up there on that hill.  Oh, nice.  We took possession of it, and we made sure that it was well taken care of for the rest of the evening.  Fantastic.  You're right.  And they call that Warrior Night, and it's just something that their commanding officer, who is now a dear friend of mine, came up with, and, boy, is it a great motivator. 
[00:53:00]  I bet.  Do you think that Sergeant Hulka was a pussy?  Sergeant who?  Hulka.  See?  Sergeant who?  Exactly.  Who in the hell was Sergeant Hulka?  Stripes.  From Stripes.  Don't know him.  See?  Oh, no, I do know who you're talking about now.  Well, here's a guy who thought about it and came up with an answer.  No, yeah, I know who you're talking about.  It's a black guy, right?  No, that was gossip from Officer and Gentleman.  No, no, no, no.  You're talking about the Sarge. 
[00:53:30]  Sergeant Hulka is a white guy.  He was a white guy.  From the movie Stripes with Bill Murray.  Then I wasn't impressed.  Black guy, something white guy.  I obviously wasn't impressed by him.  Yeah, see?  He didn't do it.  Didn't do it for him.  Jack Webb did it.  Yeah, Jack Webb.  Do you ever have girls that want to, like, you know, just sleep with you because of how you were in that film?  No, I told you, they don't want a lock of my hair.  I don't have a problem with that. 
[00:54:00]  He just goes to the Philippines or somewhere.  It does trouble me.  I'd like to have that sometimes.  Yes.  I think that could be fun once in a while, you know?  Do you know if you came here to the studio, we would definitely have a girl for you?  I'd bring a relative if I had to.  Geez, guys, you're going to have to come on live sometime.  Yeah, where are you right now?  We are having a great time, aren't we?  Yes, sir.  Hell yes.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  You guys are all the way in New York City.  That's the problem. 
[00:54:30]  New York City.  New York.  Where are you now?  I'd like to come to New York City just to make a damn statement, to tell you the truth.  Well, come on by.  You come on by.  We will hang with you.  Okay.  You guys, you know, you've got my website, HarleyErmy.com, right?  Oh, yeah.  I got it up there right now.  Have you ever looked it over?  Yes.  Have you read the, what I wrote about the war yet?  Yes, you have your State of the Union address, your solution to end hijacking. 
[00:55:00]  Okay, come on.  Take shots at me on the solution to hijacking.  What's wrong with you?  It's a little weird with the Filipino chicks involved, but you can't do it without Filipino  chicks.  What do you like about the Filipino chicks?  The flathead and the asses.  I told you, the flathead.  That's about it, though, huh?  The butt that protrudes.  You've got to have a place to put your beer.  Hey, a lot of people are asking if you could give us one, what's your major malfunction?  Just one, a little taste. 
[00:55:30]  What in the hell is your major malfunction, Private Opie?  Why aren't you over there fighting this war?  Because I'm a pussy, sir.  Toe jam, clip him.  You know, that's another thing.  Yeah.  As soon as this situation started happening here, I volunteered to go back in uniform.  Now, you can just imagine me, 57 years old, out there on the battlefield.  That's not going to happen.  Yeah.  But I could at least go in uniform and go keep the troops motivated. 
[00:56:00]  Keep them motivated.  Yeah, certainly do that.  You know, just travel around and motivate the troops.  That's what I do.  I motivate.  So, why not?  By the way, talking about motivate.  Uh-oh.  So, this brings me around to the 12-inch.  Here's a guy who's got some great segues.  I have a doll.  I have an action figure.  And I call it a 12-inch MF.  Yeah, we talked about that a little earlier, sir.  This is amazing.  It looks like you. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's very movable.  You can put it in all kinds of poses, like, choke yourself.  You know, you could get the Ken doll, who's a pussy from Barbie, and you could have him choke himself on your hand.  Well, you know, the deal is, he is 12 inches tall, and he can play with Ken and Barbie.  And who in the hell do you think down at Poolside would be in charge?  Ken would be doing push-ups all the time.  Ken would be a gopher.  And what the hell?  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't even like to think what he might be doing with Barbie. 
[00:57:00]  Are they going to come with different, like, uniform changes, like a little, um, shorts and skivvies, like a little set, like when you ran into the bathroom with the hat and your underwear?  Good night, ladies.  Exactly.  They are actually talking about some uniform changes.  Oh, that's just great.  Hey, have you heard the prank calls that are all over the Internet?  I haven't.  Aren't they disgusting?  You have heard them?  I've heard them.  My manager called me up the other day and played some for me.  I said, you know, and there's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:57:30]  I'm sitting there saying, that is really, you know, there are rude people in this world that are just so totally rude.  It's wrong.  You're talking to a few of us.  Damn it.  We love them.  Now, you're not that rude.  We love those things, man.  Yeah, but you love them, of course, but you're not doing them.  No.  I mean, you wouldn't do them.  It takes a rude, nasty, evil individual to do things like that.  No, we don't do stuff like that.  You know what would be fun?  I mean, you could just call people up from your house and do them.  You're the kind of guys who on Halloween would light the bag of on fire. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  On the doorstep, right?  It's good, clean fun.  But that's just a good joke, yeah.  And occasionally we like to egg a house.  Well, nothing wrong with egging a house.  Just for a laugh.  I mean, it comes off.  Right.  After two, three snows, you know, you'd never even know that house been egged.  How did we get here?  I don't know.  All right, we're going to let you go, sir.  You've got to get here to New York and come on our show.  Okay, guys.  You know what I'm doing right now? 
[00:58:30]  Sergeant Segway, go ahead.  What?  I'm sitting here with 400 Gunnery Sergeant Lee Ermey action figures in front of me signing  these boxes.  You're signing them.  I'm sending them out to my friends, my buddies, the guys that buy them on the website.  Well, send us one, sir.  I thought we sent you one.  Well, you want the one that's signed.  Pardon me?  We want a signed one, sir.  Oh, yeah.  You want a signed one?  Of course.  Oh. 
[00:59:00]  Well, all right, then.  We'll have a talk about that.  John Madden, what about your action figure?  Hey, my action figure, you pull a string and he doesn't say half as much as this guy.  I thought you were going to say you pull his finger.  Hey, that would have been a better line.  Maybe you'll be my writer, Sergeant.  You never know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Sergeant, thank you so much.  Guys, it's been an absolute pleasure and I look forward to our next encounter.  You're the greatest man alive, sir.  Joust away, my friends.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:59:30]  Goodbye.  Semper Fi.  Semper Fi.  Hoorah.  Nice.  Hoorah.  Isn't he great?  Oh, my God.  What a classic.  I thought he was going to pull a Buddy Epson a few times.  Can you guys explain what that is to the old Frankster?  Buddy Epson?  Yeah.  All right.  Get the Buddy Epson clip.  Yeah.  Now we've got to get the Buddy Epson clip.  We love playing this for new people that have never heard this.  Now, we don't even have to explain.  We'll just play it.  Arlie Ermey is great.  I love it.  But you've got to understand, that movie, when did it come out?  86.  86. 
[01:00:00]  A few more years have gone by.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  I'm not saying anything.  The guy's only 57 years old.  But there's just, he seems to wander a bit.  The action figure is the most, it doesn't make sense.  It says rated R, not for children.  Then it says for children over three on it.  And then it says ages 12 and up.  So what is it?  Who's that for?  Because it's rated R.  Who's that for?  I don't even know who it's for.  Is it a 12-year-old?  Don't put it in small parts.  Here's a guy who's not too sure about his body. 
[01:00:30]  My dear sweet heaven.  All right.  So we had Buddy Epson on.  He's, I think he's 102 now.  Right.  He's still alive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we asked him to sing the theme song of the Beverly Hills.  Unfortunately, he tried.  We had no clue that that was going to confuse him.  And it made for a very awkward moment on this radio show.  You would think Uncle Jed would know the words to the song.  Everyone knows the words.  So when he was doing the first scene from Full Metal Jacket, it looked like he was going 
[01:01:00]  to pull a Buddy Epson on us.  Right.  I got you.  And forget the dialogue and stuff.  But he made it through.  Perfect.  Here's the clip of Buddy Epson.  Listen to this, Frank.  Come and listen to the story about a man named poor Montaigneur, barely kept his family  fed.  And then one day, oh, he never, I'm still writing it.  When people, I'm sorry. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God, that's brutal.  I'm sorry.  It just goes right through.  Do we have time for the well doggies?  You have those up?  Oh, my God.  That's really bad.  Explain it to Frank as we set up the well doggies.  We had spoken.  We've known him for years.  Okay.  Since our Boston days.  Yeah.  And the first time he talked, we had him do the, you know, well doggies.  That whole thing.  Yeah.  And he did it.  And it sounded just like it did on the show.  Right.  It was perfect. 
[01:02:00]  And then the two other times we've had him on, the second time it was getting bad.  The third time, something happened to the man.  The degeneration of Jed Clampus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we got the normal one.  Do I have the first and the third?  This is the first and the third.  All right.  I got the first one.  This is when he was, this is when he was about 88 or so.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's good.  That's sweet.  That's tasty.  A couple of years went by and we're like, hey, let's check in with Buddy Epson.  And we asked him to do it. 
[01:02:30]  And here's what he said.  Well, doggy.  Now, we were thinking perhaps he just had a cold that day.  Get some more air in the diaphragm.  We go from the nice, smooth, well, doggy to this one.  Well, doggy.  All right.  But perhaps he was sick that day.  And then another year went by and I hope you're holding on to something here.  Well, doggy.  What happened?  I was going to get to the point where it's just, ah. 
[01:03:00]  Where dogs are just tilting their heads with their ears up.  You don't hear a thing.  So, Frank, once again, this is about five, six years ago.  Well, doggy.  Nice.  Nice.  Right?  And here is the second time.  Well, doggy.  Ouch.  And only a few months ago.  Well, doggy.  Sounds like a track and trail of locking them up on a highway.  Doggy.  Doggy.  Really? 
[01:03:30]  Doggy.  All right.  We got to play a Sergeant Hartman crank call.  Oh, do we have a, oh, we got one more, um, Buddy Epson?  Doggies.  Doggies.  All right.  Here's the 7-Eleven prank.  Using clips from Full Metal Jacket.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Jeet.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Ah.  Do you suck a ****? 
[01:04:00]  What?  Do you suck a ****?  Yeah.  Oh, I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Very mad.  It's your bad.  Talk to like on this phone, man.  What you doing, man?  You don't scare me.  Hello?  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj.  Well, no ****.  Come on, sir.  Talk to like on this, seriously.  Hello?  Don't you come **** yourself or I will unk through your head and **** on your neck.  You think I'm cute? 
[01:04:30]  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and **** my sister.  **** your sister.  Why, you little magnet.  You make me want to vomit.  Dang.  Ah.  Are you about to call me an ****?  Who are you?  Don't repile.  Huh?  Don't repile.  I don't understand.  Who are you?  Don't repile.  Huh?  Who are you?  No ****.  I'm not ****.  Who are you?  You at least un- **** yourself or I will unk through your head and **** down your neck.  Anytime. 
[01:05:00]  Okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah.  One, two, three.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Because it's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  What?  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  It's a...  Uh-oh.  If you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced.  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12. 
[01:05:30]  It's a short marriage.  Okay, good.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27?  All right.  Yeah.  And my wife of 16 years, Erin, divorced recently and we have a little six-year-old girl.  And she doesn't really understand why mommy isn't living with us anymore.  And I did my best to write this little lullaby and perhaps explain it to her.  I'd like to set up.  That's great.  Thanks.  I'm going to bring it down a little bit here.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Hush, little girl, sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight.  Daddy's here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before? 
[01:06:30]  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Because daddy likes porno and ten-dollar hoards.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus. 
[01:07:00]  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Pretty.  Pretty.  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Soon it will all be like it was before. 
[01:07:30]  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear. 
[01:08:00]  Daddy has sores on his genitals oozing with.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side. 
[01:08:30]  Right after daddy gets home from the bar,  visits his boogie and steals a new car,  he'll drive to the strip club.  And if daddy plays his cards right,  he'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-da, la-dee-da-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da.  La-dee-da, la-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da. 
[01:09:00]  La-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da.  La-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da.  Look at me.  I'm Megan.  Look at me.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Hey, even Dice is tearing up over there.  Yeah, you got me, huh?  You got my sensitive side.  Yeah.  Jackass.  Who cares?  We can't play chocolate salty balls anymore.  We got some new songs.  That's Stephen Lynch. 
[01:09:30]  His CD's called Half a Man.  You can order it by emailing him at pushead at AOL.com.  That marketing's really taking off, isn't it?  That's not my forte.  And it's pushead, P-U-S, not pusshead, which is P-U-S-S, obviously.  Right.  What did everybody do before the internet?  Like, you know, send me a postcard or something.  P-O-5.  You know?  Is that what you did?  I don't know.  All right.  You know what we do here? 
[01:10:00]  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  I wish I could have heard the rest of the game, Anthony, on Saturday.  Well, listen, man.  What happened?  It wasn't my idea.  Going to extra innings, and that's right about the time that we pulled up to the pumpkin punt.  Did you do it again this year, dude?  Look, I understand that I am, like, opening up a can of worms here. 
[01:10:30]  I'm not stupid, but we're pretty honest on this show, so.  Oh, yeah.  I drove, you know, out east on the island to get the pumpkins, Anthony.  You did a little pumpkin pass picking.  Oh, yeah, with Sandy.  Oh, did you have a little wagon?  See, a lot of the cars going out to...  Wait a minute.  A lot of the cars that you see on the LIE going out east,  they have their own little pumpkin wagons that they tie to the top of their SUVs or station wagons, 
[01:11:00]  and you could pull your own little pumpkin wagon through the pumpkin pack as you pick your own pumpkins.  So that's what you were doing this weekend, huh?  Man, I will never understand women, ever.  So I agreed to do the pumpkin...  Again.  ...picking again.  Right.  Shut up!  Dick.  Don't laugh too hard.  The shock feature in that wedding ring is quite funny there, Rick. 
[01:11:30]  When she hits the button at home and it's like a stun gun.  All right, listen.  I don't understand...  I just don't understand you women.  All right.  So I agreed to go pumpkin picking, okay?  And if you know anything about the island, I'm sure it's like this for Jersey and Pennsylvania and Westchester, whatever.  You have to drive out to the wilderness a little bit.  It's part of the experience, I guess, right?  Part of it.  Okay.  So we're on the North Fork of Long Island and, you know, farm stand after farm stand, farm field after farm field is nothing but pumpkins. 
[01:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  So I drive about, I would say, a good hour from my house, Anthony.  Sure.  Wouldn't you think that's far enough into the wilderness?  Of course, when you're going east on Long Island.  Oh, no.  It wasn't far enough.  It's all farms out.  I'm like, they're picking pumpkins right here.  Because I'm thinking I could get home and watch the end of the Met game.  I have it on on FAG or whatever station carries the Mets.  That's right.  Game's real interesting. 
[01:12:30]  And I'm like, okay, look, if I figure this out perfectly, we can get the pumpkin picking out of the way.  I could drink some stupid cider, run through a damn corn maze, and I'm home on the couch.  I have the corn maze.  I did not do the corn maze this year.  The corn maze.  I forgot last year you had to go through the corn maze.  Oh, boy, just like the shining, isn't it?  Right.  Just like the hedge maze.  So, this was my...  You could see through the corn.  This is my problem.  So, now, it wasn't good enough.  Oh, no, let's keep going further out.  Further into the wilderness.  Further, further, keep going, going. 
[01:13:00]  I'm an hour and a half from home.  It wasn't good enough.  You got to keep going?  Going and going.  I'm like, what's wrong with that field?  Look, look, on this one, we could drive on a dirt road and really feel like we're in the middle of nowhere and pick our pumpkins.  Oh, you could have gone a little off-road.  Off-road.  It wasn't good enough.  Know why?  Why?  She wanted the little red wagon.  Oh, you needed a wagon?  They didn't have wagons.  No, I guess only one farm has the little red wagon, Anthony.  Which is about two hours from home, Anthony. 
[01:13:30]  I was pretty much in Greenport at this point.  Oh.  Did you carry the pumpkins back in your butt, you homo?  Did you take a hayride?  You know.  Did you take a hayride?  I will punch this down and let Gary abuse me.  Gary, go ahead.  Yeah, what a wimp this guy is.  He's gone out there to get pumpkins.  Come on.  He ain't got chicks.  Give me a break.  He's well.  Anthony, you're great.  See?  I did that to myself.  I saw it on the screen. 
[01:14:00]  That's okay.  Anthony took the abuse yesterday about the soap operas.  Joe, what's going on?  Oh, you homo.  Let me ask you a question.  Did you go mountain bike riding with the seat off when you were done today?  All right.  Come on.  Did you put a hole in the pumpkin and bang it?  You homo.  You should go work for FAG.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  So you pulled the little wagon, Opie?  Through the pumpkin field with the other pumpkin people?  I will not confirm or deny that fact, Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  I'm sure you pulled the wagon.  For the love of God, I hope there's not a picture.  Oh.  So you pulled the wagon.  For the love of God, I hope there's not a picture.  Did you pick your pumpkins and pick your...  No one was left just, you know, pumpkins that had footprints in them and kick marks from  all the other pissed off guys.  Ravaged pumpkins.  Ravaged pumpkins.  So this is my hell.  So I'm timing the Met game.  Yeah.  Okay?  Because now I'm like, all right, I got to keep driving because this game is getting really 
[01:15:00]  interesting.  Yeah.  All right?  So I didn't mind that we were now about two hours from home.  Mm-hmm.  Start losing the signal for FAG.  Oh, no.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Then it goes into extra innings as I'm losing the signal as we pull up to the pumpkin farm  with the little red wagon, Anthony.  The little red wagon.  So to make a long story short, when I finally got back in the car after our little fun in  the pumpkin field...  Yeah.  Ugh.  How many pumpkins did you get, Opie?  I'm really concerned.  Oh, three, Anthony.  Three pumpkins.  Could have got that in Huntington, where I live. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, you know, they're selling pumpkins right down there in downtown Huntington.  Pretty much.  And you can pick up the cool stencils to cut the jack-o-lantern.  You're going to make a jack-o-lantern, Opie?  You know, all right, I'll let you guys have some fun.  Fine.  Here we go.  Here comes the abuse.  Lou.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Did you put two small pumpkins in the front of your pants where your balls used to be?  Hey.  Come on, you can relate to me, right, Lou?  Nah, not really. 
[01:16:00]  I don't think too many people can at this point.  Oh, yeah, I'm the only guy that gets dragged pumpkin picking.  Yeah, well...  Please.  Johnny.  Hey.  Hey.  You got two months, Opie.  You'll be out cutting Christmas trees down there.  No, no, no.  I've never done that, and I never will.  Yeah, you say that now.  Let's drive 200 miles upstate to cut down a piece of the stretch.  No, no, no.  Floating up the display.  No, I've never done that one.  Not yet.  Homo and Anthony.  Thank you, Johnny.  Homo and Anthony.  And this guy.  Uh, Rick. 
[01:16:30]  Homo and A?  Homo and A.  What's the deal, dude?  Come on, you've never gone pumpkin picking.  Yeah, but I wouldn't...  And I didn't know the Mets game...  I didn't know the Mets game...  Well, that's what this show's about, we're a little honest, and we...  I mean, you're whooped.  You're pumpkin whooped.  You want some pumpkin pie or something like that.  Come on.  And I didn't know the Mets game was going to go into extra innings like that.  It killed me.  Yeah, but I mean, I thought you were a Mets fan.  I am.  Yeah, really.  That's the problem.  Well, I watched.  I watched.  I listened to the whole game all the way out.  They tied it up, and the only reason why I didn't continue to listen to the game in the car, 
[01:17:00]  we truly lost the signal at this point.  It was going in and out when your favorite radio station goes in and out.  Oh.  And you're in a little Mets game, and the next thing you know, you're hearing Bette Miller  like, oh, oh, oh.  Bob Murphy back on the thing.  Oh.  Wings beneath my wings.  You know, wind beneath my wings.  Whatever.  Thank you, Rick.  All right, dude.  Don't you hate that, though?  You're convinced that you've got a few more miles out of your radio station.  Ah, it just dies, yeah.  Ah, John, what's going on?  How you doing, man?  Hey.  Listen, I had to do it, too.  The only difference is I'm not a homo like you. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't have to do it until I had kids.  Oh, man, I'm telling you, at least me and my friend have to do it.  We're sitting there crying on each other's shoulders, but we got kids.  We look at geeks like you, and we go, oh, man, wait till this idiot gets married.  Oh, man, I'm telling you, what a wuss.  Oh, my God.  Listen, you guys are great.  Keep it up.  Thank you.  God, this is painful.  I hate this.  Frank, go ahead.  You are some homo, I'll tell you.  Listen, I'm only going to give you guys five more minutes, and I'm getting out of this 
[01:18:00]  subject.  I'll tell you, man, that's terrible.  Like I said, it's so easy to be a fag on this show.  It changes every day.  Hey, Ron, what's up?  I got to tell you something, man.  Yeah.  A fag doesn't begin to describe it.  You guys ragging on Rick all the time.  You're not even close to married yet.  True.  And this is what you're going down with?  True.  Why don't you go to the places in Dix Hills with the little red wagons?  Wasn't far enough.  Wasn't far enough.  Oh, my God.  You've got to be out in the wilderness.  You know, this could get ugly, but my girlfriend's on the line. 
[01:18:30]  Look who's calling.  Thank you, Ron.  All right.  Sandy.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hey, Sandy.  Hi.  You've been listening?  Yes, I have.  Did you hear about the pumpkin picking?  Yes, I did.  Did you have fun with Opie pulling the wagon?  Yes.  We had a wonderful time.  Did he pull the wagon?  Yes, we both pulled the wagon.  You both?  He failed to mention the fact that there's pictures of him pulling the wagon with pumpkins in it.  There's also a picture of him.  They had this huge pumpkin cutout that you stand behind it and you put your face through it. 
[01:19:00]  I guess you forgot to mention that there's a picture of him doing that, too.  Wait a minute.  He's sticking his head to a big pumpkin cutout.  Wasn't my idea.  That was, too.  Oh, Steve's got to get the website back on.  We've got to get those pictures on.  What else?  What about when you were, like, knee-deep in the pumpkin vines trying to find some gourds?  Gourds?  All those little gourds, like the yellow and orange little... 
[01:19:30]  To do what?  She wants to put them in a basket, Anthony.  I want to bring them in a basket.  He didn't mention that?  And he was the one...  Wait, no, no, no, no.  He was the one who had to buy the apple cider.  Well, yeah.  I got some apple cider.  I was thirsty after, you know, falling away the pumpkins.  You know, I forced you to even get apple cider.  Did you get your Dickens cider?  From Dickens Apple Farm.  Yeah, where's Dickens cider?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, it sounds like you had a lot of fun. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  And wait, wait.  Oh, Seth.  If I remember...  Enough.  Enough.  Didn't you last year...  Didn't your wife buy the cutouts and you did the pumpkins for her?  Well, that's true, yeah.  Huh?  Huh?  I did.  There was a stencil.  There was a stencil and you did the pumpkin?  And I put the stencil on the pumpkin and I was at home...  Cutting them out?  I believe watching the Yankees as I was cutting it out with a beer in one hand and a knife  in the other.  I see no problem with that. 
[01:20:30]  All right, Seth.  Thank you for burying me today.  We appreciate it.  Well, like I said, we have pictures, so...  I don't know about that.  And I trudged out to the wilderness of Wallbaums, aisle three for my pumpkins.  And wait, wait.  The reason we went out so far is because...  All right, did you pick your little wagon and everything?  All right, listen.  Was there a whole method to picking a good wagon?  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  I got to go.  No, no, don't hang up on me.  What, Sandy?  Don't hang up.  Go ahead.  No, what happened was they had wagons, the little red wagons. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  But there was a lot of people, so you had to wait until someone went back to their car  to empty their pumpkins to get the wagon.  You had to wait for a wagon, sure.  It's just like the Matterhorn bobsled at Disney, the fun of getting a wagon.  So you wait online for that.  At that point, I was ready to just say, forget it.  We'll just walk through the fields and get the pumpkins, but he insisted on the wagon.  Opie insisted on waiting for the wagon.  You're not going to make me look bad.  All right, thanks, Sam.  What skirt was Opie wearing?  Shut up. 
[01:21:30]  I'll talk to you later.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  I wonder if he got a ride in the wagon.  Did she pull him along?  Can we finish this segment?  John.  I'm sticking up for you, Opie, because, you know, I got stuck on a hayride.  And the answer here is Sandra.  I'm going to have to go back to your home-off.  Put your head back and get a cardboard cutout, and there's pictures to prove it.  Put your head in the cardboard cutout of the bunk.  I made sure we left the camera at home. 
[01:22:00]  She said, you got the camera?  Yeah, we got the camera.  Yeah, it's on the kitchen table.  There's no evidence, okay?  Unless there's a high-powered rifle pointed at your head in that picture of you behind that pumpkin.  Jack.  Hey, Angelo.  Faggot.  I mean, homo-sagelo.  David.  Remember, I brought this abuse onto myself.  Of course you did.  I did not have to bring this up.  I have one question for you.  Who are you going to dress up as for Halloween? 
[01:22:30]  Is it going to be Ricky Martin, or is it going to be Barbie?  I can't do this.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I need your primary dial-up number.  If I'm going to start the transaction, get you onto the internet.  Oh.  Just a moment.  Just a moment.  What?  Yes, I'm handling this one.  I've got it.  I have it. 
[01:23:00]  I'm on...  Yes, I picked it up.  I do know how to do this.  What?  I do know how.  I'm sorry, what?  Go ahead, ma'am.  Who might speak to?  Tech Support 7D2.  Okay.  You have a very, very peculiar way of dealing with customers.  I'm sorry, ma'am.  I haven't started dealing with you yet. 
[01:23:30]  I was talking to the gentleman I'm working with.  Okay.  I just got this free internet thing through Barnes & Noble.  Hmm.  What?  I'm not aware of the free program.  I'm just the tech support.  Just a moment.  Yes.  Well, you didn't tell me about the free program.  Hey.  Screw you.  You didn't tell me about the free program.  F*** you, man.  You didn't tell me about the f***ing free program. 
[01:24:00]  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, ma'am.  That's no way to talk on the phone.  Oh, did you hear that?  Of course I did.  I'm sorry.  I thought I put you on hold, ma'am.  I'm sorry you had to hear that.  I don't understand this kind of business.  I'm just trying to get the sponsor.  Well, to be honest, this is my last day on the job, so I don't care if I get fired.  Okay.  Would you give me someone else, please?  Fine with me.  She wants to talk to you. 
[01:24:30]  Hello?  Where am I calling?  Tech support.  Tech support.  What's your problem?  I was just trying to, I feel like I'm on, I'm on a, anyway, I was just trying to put  on the Barnes & Noble free internet service.  Okay, ma'am.  We just started that free service, and we are just tech support. 
[01:25:00]  We do not know anything about the free service, unless you're talking about your primary access  number.  Uh, I don't know who you are, or what kind of service this is.  Thank you very much.  We are tech support.  But I don't understand, um...  Just a moment, please.  Okay.  Put that down.  Put that down.  That is very expensive.  Do not, do not, do not show your finger. 
[01:25:30]  I'm sorry, ma'am.  We're, these internet businesses, you know, we're just getting off the ground.  Obviously, you're not going to get off the ground.  I can't believe I'm talking to real people that are talking to me like this.  I'm not talking to you, ma'am.  I was talking to the man I work with.  I know, but he was talking to you before, and I was hearing everything.  Well, our mute system isn't working.  Uh-huh.  Now, is there anybody else in this office? 
[01:26:00]  No, ma'am.  We're just the two.  It only takes two to do tech support.  But we have nothing to do with the free program, like I keep telling you.  Oh, I see.  Do you have a tech support problem?  Well, I can't.  I started putting myself...  I started doing...  Screw you!  No.  You screw off.  Hello.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Do you, do you, do you... 
[01:26:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking for us.  They do all the talking for us.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Manny in the studio helping us out.  And the fine female cops, Lisa and Karen.  Very pretty cops.  I was very surprised.  I was expecting two beasts to enter the studio.  I've got to be honest with you.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:00]  And Anthony's up first, I guess.  It's time to resist an arrest.  I don't want to be first.  This sucks.  I was hanging out with Jay Moore.  It was like one in the morning when we left Paisano's.  I didn't even get to sleep until like two.  You knew we were coming.  So now you've got an excuse when they kick your ass right now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of pussying that.  You better go for me.  I promise you get the two and the brother.  Anthony has taken his...  Wait, she says the rules now.  No, because she gets all the guys on their knees with their hands behind their head before you even approach them. 
[01:27:30]  No, we can't.  So what, you say like, you know, get on your knees.  Get on your knees, hands above your head.  And then you holster your weapon, walk up to them with your cuffs.  And then the second you touch one of us, then we can start the resisting.  You got it.  So we're going to start on our knees?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a couple.  Probably for our own benefit, to tell you the truth.  Because if she flips a leg out, we're just going to go on the floor anyway.  All right, well, Ann, get up.  You're first.  Oh, this blows. 
[01:28:00]  Lisa is convinced she could get Anthony handcuffed within 30 seconds.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Lisa, you have a real nice body, by the way.  With that little belly shirt going on.  Dude, check out the other one.  Yo.  Wow, they're both really nice.  All right.  Oh, no.  All right, Anthony is...  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Ann, get a mic.  Rick, get a mic to Anthony.  Yeah, get a mic.  Ann, turn the other way so you can face right into the mic.  All right, Anthony is on his knees. 
[01:28:30]  All right, hold on.  Ann, you got your knees, your legs crossed behind you, too?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Lisa is behind Anthony.  Anthony is putting his hands in front of him like they're against a wall.  He's on his knees.  His legs are crossed behind him.  Lisa's got the handcuffs.  Wait, who's got the stopwatch?  Okay.  I got it.  All right.  I got it.  Rick, you tell him when to go, okay?  All right.  I'll give you a five-second countdown, okay?  Wait.  You're starting from that position? 
[01:29:00]  No, man.  Hey, hey.  Oh, what is this, man?  Hey, where y'all be arresting people at?  In Beverly Hills.  Right.  Yeah, we got to, like, fight a little bit.  Anthony's got...  Wait, wait.  Anthony's...  Hey, you fagging out already.  My mistakes.  Oh, Anthony's just going to be a cop-out.  Ann's got his hands behind his head.  He's on his knees.  Okay, ready?  All right, hold on, hold on.  Ready, set, go.  Go.  All right, Ann's fighting.  Whoa. 
[01:29:30]  The cops got him down.  They are struggling, Anthony.  Oh, now they're all over him.  Oh, my goodness.  Ann's got him loving this.  Ann's fighting like a mother.  Okay, Lisa.  Lisa's got one arm, and the other cop's got the other arm.  Ann is getting busted up.  His face is crunched against the couch.  They both have him down.  All right.  Oh.  He's up.  He's up.  He's fighting.  He's fighting.  God, I feel like I'm watching an episode of Cops.  It's at 20 seconds.  Ann's fighting.  Lisa's got him down.  Oh, Ann's running.  Ann's running. 
[01:30:00]  He's done.  He's making his way for the door.  He's making his way for the door.  They're fighting.  Oh, they nailed him.  Oh, my God.  This is like fight club.  We just hit 30 seconds.  All right.  I think Anthony is tiring.  Lisa's on his back.  Karen's got the one arm.  Lisa's got the other arm.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  One handcuff is on, and here goes the other handcuff.  Karen is screaming at him to put his other hand around his back.  And Anthony is...  I can't see a thing.  You're going to have to let me know.  Anthony is cuffed. 
[01:30:30]  Cuffed at 58 seconds.  Hey, but they kicked his ass.  They did kick his ass.  Wow.  He ain't moving.  Holy cow.  Get...  All right.  Get Ann up so he can talk.  Oh, they're even lifting him up.  Goddamn, man.  You look like...  Wow.  Ann, you look like...  He does.  He is out of breath.  He's on the lesbian couch right now.  Wait, get a mic.  Get a mic on him.  Yo.  He's not moving from that couch, though.  Hey, I got it. 
[01:31:00]  Tough.  Holy.  All right.  You girls are kind of tough.  All right, Ann.  He's out.  Ann is exhausted on the couch.  I'm feeling in my right thumb.  He made a nice dash for the door.  If he could have gotten out of that door, he was home.  Oh, yo.  Ann, how do you feel?  Exhausted.  Exhausted.  You look it.  Woo!  Shane.  Ladies, I must say, that was very impressive.  Wow.  She cuffed you.  She's got a belly shirt on.  Dude, the choke hold.  They put you in a choke hold?  I didn't see that.  Choke hold.  I felt myself slipping away. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  They're taking the handcuffs off, Ann.  Ann, I think you're officially part of Fight Club as well, by the way.  Yeah.  Because that was like resisting arrest and Fight Club all in the same thing, man.  Hey, Ann, you didn't fag out at all, baby.  Man, I was trying to get out the door.  You almost made it to the door.  All right.  Ann's getting back to his little area in the studio.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  At first, you could tell they were being a little gentle.  Like seeing how far I was going to take it. 
[01:32:00]  At the point I tried to choke hold.  I saw that.  My head thrust to the floor.  I saw that.  The one cuff was kind of twisted on my arm.  I thought my wrist was going to break.  And then I just gave up.  I went, okay, okay.  And I actually said the F word.  Like I was really being arrested.  I'm like, ah, they got me.  Look how happy they are.  Oh, wow.  All right.  How long did I last?  58 seconds.  All right.  That's not bad.  Let's prove to you guys out there that we can do it.  That was pretty impressive.  You're kicking ass, man. 
[01:32:30]  Karen, how tall are you?  We know Lisa's like 5'1 or so.  I'm about 5'5.  Holy Jesus, man.  I'm going to give us warm water.  Well, then you're a cop.  Isn't that going to give you the good stuff?  I'm just kidding.  You're next, Mark.  Manny, you ever see that happen in the neighborhood?  I would be nice if I were you.  Yeah, all too many times.  Yeah.  Manny, this is like a nightmare for you, isn't it?  Only rarely it's a white guy like me.  No, you believe me.  Thanks, Pastor.  20 seconds in, you was the average criminal, Ant.  I was.  I was fighting for my freedom. 
[01:33:00]  When your hat came off, you was a cocaine smuggler.  What's up, my brothers?  Why are we being oppressed?  I'm going to start calling you Khali.  Yeah.  Oh, that was impressive.  All right.  Do I have to go next?  I don't want to go now, man.  Come on, Donnie.  Come on.  You're next.  I'll go.  Oh, man, I'm going to look bagged up.  We're not going to ask for about 10 seconds.  I got to get a mic closer.  Boy, these ladies are rough, man.  The harder you fight, the more they will fight you.  Dude, after seeing what you went through, I'm like shaking right now. 
[01:33:30]  Whew.  Oh, God.  My heart is pounding, man.  All right.  Opie's down on his knees.  I thought the lesbians got my heart pounding.  Forget about it.  Yeah, this is good stuff.  Now, were they able to get the first cuff on before you started fighting?  Let me tell you, the second you feel metal on your wrist, you could start resisting.  But the second you feel it, one is cuffed.  I mean, it's very hard.  I think Opie's going down quick.  See, brother, let's get the timer, too. 
[01:34:00]  I got the timer ready.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Hey, help me out, man.  You got my back, right?  Can I do that?  No, you can't.  There's one.  Oh, there they go.  There it is.  Opie's on the floor, man.  They are fighting him.  Oh, wow.  They are fighting, man.  They're riding him.  All right.  They're both on top of him.  They got him in that damn hole.  He's kicking his legs.  I just saw two legs fly up.  Wow.  Is he screaming?  Yeah.  Yo, this is real.  I don't know if I'm doing this.  One arm's back. 
[01:34:30]  He's at 20 seconds now.  Holy.  All right.  She's got him almost between her legs.  He is fighting, man.  And 30 seconds.  Yo, they are playing rough.  Yes.  They've got his head pinned to the floor.  He's cuffed.  He's cuffed.  Wow.  Dump out.  Dump out.  I dumped.  I dumped.  I dumped.  Oh, they kicked your ass, man. 
[01:35:00]  Get up.  Get up, Conrad.  Get up, you criminal.  That was in 39 seconds.  How about that?  Holy crap.  You freely give that last hand over when they start hurting you.  39 seconds, dude.  Holy cow.  I honestly thought it was going to last a minute, but they were pulling that right hand so hard.  It hurts so bad.  You know what?  You freely give up the uncuffed hand.  It hurts so bad.  You're just like, all right, it's over.  It's like I was trying to stay as long as I could, and then it just hurts so much. 
[01:35:30]  I know.  That's how they got me.  Look at my wrist.  That's how they got me, dude.  Good luck, dude.  Wow.  Wow.  It was like a rodeo.  The way legs were flying up.  It was like a rodeo.  Dude, the way your legs were kicking up like a freaking Bronco.  I don't know what else to do.  Rick could be a rough one.  Look at his guns he's got.  Look at the arms on him.  I just got my ass kicked by a girl.  It's like 5'1", 95 pounds.  They beat up by girls.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  Well, Rick is up next.  Rick's got a couple of guns on him there.  If you look at his arms there, ladies.  We'll see if he's packing.  Ah.  Yeah.  I didn't like the grabbing of the cojones.  I don't know.  After getting my face smashed into the rug, it was a little too much.  You got to do what you got to do.  I understand that, Karen.  Thank you.  All right.  And you're making your way over there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to be able to see this, you know.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  Wait.  Who's got the watch for Rick?  Who's got the stopwatch?  All right. 
[01:36:30]  Spaz.  Oh, Spaz is going to keep time.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  His hands are behind his head.  Hands behind his head.  The second they touch, the time starts, Spaz.  Oh, they're going.  All right.  Rick's face.  On the ground.  He's curled up in the fetal position.  They got both of their arms around his head.  Double headlock.  His one wrist is cuffed.  He's sitting up now.  Wow.  They're having a tough time with Rick.  He's on his stomach.  No, he's back up on his knees. 
[01:37:00]  Whoa.  The one chick stepped on his ankle.  Ow.  Whoa.  Oh, he's screaming, Anthony.  Yeah.  They are really pulling out all the dirty tricks for Rick.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Rick's doing quite well.  Oh, it's just getting...  All right.  The cops are getting crushed.  They're having a tough time getting that arm behind his back.  Take him out.  Take him out.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, his face just went into the floor.  All right.  Hold.  Watch those cart racks.  All right.  One second.  All right.  Rick is screaming.  They're just bending his arm now. 
[01:37:30]  Rick is screaming.  Rick is screaming in pain.  He doesn't want to give up that arm.  He doesn't want to give up the arm, but he's going to have to.  Here we go.  Here it comes.  Give it up, Rick.  He went a minute.  He went a minute so far.  He's running out of steam, though, Ant.  He is really resistant, man.  Oh, they got the choke hold on him now.  They almost had that arm behind him twice.  There it goes.  There it goes.  One arm.  He's rolling back over again.  No one talking trash, though. 
[01:38:00]  Everyone is saving their breath.  Oh, my God.  She's got him in the choke hold.  Rick is exhausted.  Rick is exhausted.  We're up to a minute and a half.  Oh.  Rick doing a great job.  Minute and a half.  Oh, there it is.  Rick has lost control of his butt.  His butt is kind of.  Whoa.  He is putting up a fight.  There's stuff flying.  He's flying.  Minute 45.  Oh, he's grabbing the package.  That's not good.  I knew Rick would put up a good fight. 
[01:38:30]  He's got them arms.  Yeah, I know.  That's true, too.  They're a little tired from cuffing Ant and I, but Rick is definitely.  Watch the cart rackets.  And Rick's definitely doing a good job here.  Ow.  Oh, he said ow.  That's not a good sign.  No, he's not.  He is not giving up, man.  The one cop has her knee on Rick's throat right now.  On his head.  On his head until Rick is screaming.  Oh, look.  He goes, all right, all right.  Time.  Time.  Two minutes, 15 seconds. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Whoa.  Son of a whore, he says.  He is in pain.  The girls are exhausted.  The more you fight, the more they'll fight, Rick.  Them's the rules.  Oh, they want to leave him cuffed.  All right.  Whoa.  Rick is not getting up.  You all right, Rick?  He's exhausted.  Look at him.  That was brutal.  Fight club.  That was brutal.  That was great.  I saw a knee on Rick's cheek at one point. 
[01:39:30]  Rick is the champion.  He lasted two minutes, 15 seconds.  His face was...  You know something?  Rick can take some pain because that cuffed hand was just turning white.  Oh, look at his wrist.  Oh, damn, man.  Look how tight they had that cuff.  He wouldn't give up.  Rick, grab a mic.  Look at that.  They got you good.  Rick, what was the breaking point where you finally said, all right, all right, what was  hurting so bad?  I thought I was going to get some, man.  I heard one point you said, all right, all right. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, it's because the cuff got so tight right there on that vein where it's getting  all black now.  Yeah.  That's where it was just like, okay, I don't want to break anything.  Right.  You all right, Rick?  We're sorry if we hurt you.  Look at his nose.  He's got a bloody nose.  Oh, you got...  Oh.  What's that little move you do to take out the ankle?  Oh, you step on that ankle and you're pushing it in and they can't do anything.  Yeah.  It hurts.  It's very painful.  Rick bleeding from the nose.  Wow, he's bleeding from his nose.  Bravo, we got bloodshed. 
[01:40:30]  We have blood.  All right.  We like blood on the Opinion Anthem show.  Wow.  I must say, ladies, that's quite impressive.  Look at Rick.  I've never seen his hair messed up before.  He's a wreck.  He started fresh.  We started after cuffing two other people prior to that, so it took a little while.  Yeah, but Anthony's like a girl.  He was kind of tough.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I don't think you girls need any excuses.  I think you did great.  Thank you.  Look at the cart rack. 
[01:41:00]  Look at the weaning tower of cart rack.  We got to fix the studio before we get out of here today.  I was really turned on for a second there.  Yeah, for a second.  You see what she did to your package to try to make you resist?  Oh, yeah.  I had a face full of my own stuff.  Yeah, you were.  You were completely in the snail position.  Manny, what do you think?  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm pretty impressed.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I can't take anything away from the girls, and you guys are pretty tough.  What a show this has been, huh, Ant?  Woo! 
[01:41:30]  I'm exhausted.  Rick looks out.  Yeah.  Rick, you look completely spent.  Rick, let's see the rest, man.  Between hypnotism and getting his ass beat up.  I hope Rick's wife doesn't come looking for us.  Wow, look at that wrist, man.  Yeah.  Damn, that's good.  He was using, like, his ass almost as a block, so you couldn't get the arm back around.  Yeah, at one point, he used his ass to push me into that rack there.  That's when you have to knee them in the cheek.  That's when you have to knee them in the head.  I saw the knee on the cheek, which was a great move.  Your face was squished, Rick. 
[01:42:00]  It was just like...  What's your name again?  Karen.  Karen.  Karen's stepping on my ankle.  She's stomping on it like that.  Yeah, she's kicking me.  I'm like, what the hell?  Karen scares me.  Like, Lisa does it with a smile.  Karen has this look on her face when she's doing it that you don't want to mess with.  You've got to get the job done.  Yeah, I understand that.  You're more than capable.  I'd hate to be married to her.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:30]  Now, the manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager,  the Orioles, Earl Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  The manager from Frederick Merrill wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you. 
[01:43:00]  You get them big f***suckers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark, and you can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan, 
[01:43:30]  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the f***ing night.  So if this f***er could mind his own business and let me manage the f***ing team, we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lady's coming from, rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street, she might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while. 
[01:44:00]  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go f*** yourself and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball f***ing Network.  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&M, the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power. 
[01:44:30]  We've got to interrupt the festivities, because the legend is on the phone.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Ozzy!  How are you doing?  What's going on, bro?  I'm just, I'm just, I believe it or not, I'm traveling around, to Manhattan right now.  Oh, you are?  I'm going to get a helicopter to an in-store tonight.  Yeah, sounds like you were at our road show last night.  Yeah, we were doing another one tonight.  Yeah, we had a huge party last night, Ozzy, in Philly, and we're completely hungover.  You can relate to that, right? 
[01:45:00]  Absolutely.  Right on, man.  Of course.  So, where are you?  In a limo in Manhattan?  I'm in a van going to the airport to get a helicopter to take me through.  Where is the in-store tonight, Ozzy?  Where is it?  I don't know.  I think he...  I can't remember on the island.  I'm going to go to an in-store appearance.  Then I'm going to fly from there to Philadelphia to see you guys tomorrow.  Well, no, we're in New York.  Are you in New York?  Yeah, but we're syndicated all over the place, and I think I figured this out. 
[01:45:30]  You're in Manhattan.  They're getting you to a helicopter, and they're going to put you on a helicopter so you do a CD signing.  Something like that.  You're on the right path.  Hey, Ozzy, I've got to tell you, I heard the new CD.  It's phenomenal.  Thank you very much.  Your voice has held up extremely well all these years.  It's really...  I mean, Tim Palmer, the producer, did a really good job with it.  And you have the end result, you know.  It seems like this is like a really personal CD. 
[01:46:00]  There's a lot of stuff about the way you're feeling it, man.  It's really terrific.  Did you do it on purpose?  It didn't start out to be...  I didn't...  It's turned out to be somewhat of a...  One of my most personal albums to date.  And I didn't intend to do that, but that's the way it kind of came about, you know.  Yeah.  You have a nice ballad, it seems like, to your kids.  Dream is a dreamer you're talking about.  Yeah.  You know, the real...  That song, I never get tired of hearing it.  I think it's one of the best things I've ever had anything to do with it. 
[01:46:30]  It's really good.  The album's a really good album, I think.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Gets Me Through is a song off the album that you wrote for the fans there, Ozzy.  Well, yeah, but I don't really like discussing who or what I wrote it for.  Right.  I mean, some people might think it's something completely different, but the truth of the  matter is I really did write it for the fans.  My fans have been the greatest love affair I've ever had in my life. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, I really genuinely do love the guys, people out there.  Right on.  Hey, we got Jim Norton in the studio.  He helps us out with the radio show, Ozzy.  He is a huge fan of yours, a huge Black Sabbath fan.  I met you, actually, at MTV years ago.  It's funny.  I beg your pardon?  I met you at MTV.  Can you speak?  I can't hear you.  I met you a few years ago at MTV.  You met me?  At MTV.  At MTV.  When was that?  Oh, years ago. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  I made you uncomfortable.  I was staring at you like John Hinckley looking at Jodie Foster.  You were really uncomfortable by me.  Oh?  You made me uncomfortable.  I didn't mean to.  I was just staring at you, licking my lips nervously.  Yeah, he's such a big fan, Ozzy, that he was staring uncontrollably at you.  Oh, well.  Hey, did you fire Joe Holmes because you wanted Zach back?  No, no, no, no, no.  I didn't invite Joe.  I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't.  My fans are saying, Joe's great, Zach's great, Ozzy's great, but Zach and Ozzy together are the greatest. 
[01:48:00]  And so I kind of, I kind of lent towards what the fans wanted to see, really.  And Joe's got about three or four of his songs on the album, you know, which I wrote with Joe.  You seem to have a couple of ballads on this album, too.  It seems like...  Yeah, kind of, there's like a one ballad and there was one kind of middle of the road kind of a song.  Junkie's a great song, too. 
[01:48:30]  Hello?  Yeah, Junkie, great song.  Ozzy!  Yes?  Are you still dry or have you, do you partake in any drink or anything?  Semi-dry.  Semi-dry.  What's your poison of choice?  Oh, the occasional glass of wine, then I don't, and that's about it, you know?  That's it, huh?  Then my wife goes, no more.  Yeah.  My wife's the lord, the lord and master of my domain. 
[01:49:00]  She's, you've heard enough, that's enough.  When's she going to get her sainthood?  Pardon?  When is she going to get her sainthood?  Her sainthood for dealing with you for so long.  I don't know, she deserved one, didn't she?  Yeah.  Hey, Ozzy, your daughters are getting older.  What would you do if your daughter brought home a kid as a boyfriend and he was like a 17-year-old Ozzy Osbourne?  That's a difficult question for me to answer because I think I'd be worried about my kids. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  I was a very humble kind of a teenager.  I was crazy.  How do you teach your kids, now that you're a little older and wiser, how do you teach them to stay away from some of the same stuff that you...  Well, they've seen me come home in different stages, so I think I'll put them off, you know.  I mean, all kids are going to experiment with, like, parts and alcohol and things, but, you know, my wife's really on top of the case. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, she's incredible with it, you know.  My wife's, she does deserve a sign of it because she runs my business, she runs the house, she renovates my house, she's renovated my house.  She finds time for every one of the kids and all the dogs and cats we have, you know.  Right.  Well, God bless her.  I've been meaning to ask you this for years.  Do you have any tattoos on your...  Uh, no. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  That's all he wanted to know.  I had to know that, Ozzy.  All right, Ozzy, they're telling...  We've got another five, nine inches tattoos on there.  All right.  Very nice.  Well, we've got to let you go.  They're telling us...  All right, take care.  Nice talking to you guys.  Yeah, they're telling us we've got to get you on a helicopter.  So, the in-store's tonight?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Ozzy, you're the coolest human being on the face of the earth.  All right, God bless you, man.  All right, Ozzy.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Ozzy.  That was a nice surprise, right? 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Nice.  That was cool.  I feel good about my own hearing loss at this point, man.  You know...  Hey, hey, what?  Hey, but sometimes they go and take them by the helicopter, and you're like, I'm supposed  to have a seat in the back.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  You're listening to the Rush Limbaugh Show.  No, no, no.  Hello, I call you a bloody thing.  Hello. 
[01:51:30]  You know, the funniest thing is Pete Johnson, the engineer, was out there freaking out.  He's like, what's wrong?  A caller can't hear you through the thing?  No.  What's wrong with the phone system?  He's out there in a panic.  You know, like, dude, it's Ozzy.  He's fried.  I'll rewire his brain.  He's got a cell phone moving, so, you know...  All right.  I don't think the legend can't hear.  He heard the first part of the calls very well, but then it seems like they moved into  a different zone, and he lost some of the connection.  That's what it is.  With hearing unknown from God, it's all the earth borns.  What? 
[01:52:00]  What?  That's Rush Limbaugh.  Rush to where?  No.  That's why I'm taking a helicopter.  Aaron, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a suggestion.  Next time Ozzy calls, maybe instead of speaking, he should sing everything he wants to say, so  we can understand what he's trying to get out.  Yeah, you can understand every word Ozzy says when he's singing, but then he talks.  We love our time with Ozzy.  And one more thing.  I've never seen Norton more humble when he's speaking to anyone than when he's speaking 
[01:52:30]  to Ozzy.  You don't understand how huge a fan Norton is.  Norton doesn't ask for much from us, and he begged us.  He goes, dude, you don't understand.  Ozzy's like God in my eyes.  I need to talk to him.  Yeah, I had to.  I mean, most interviews, I'll ask one question just to do it, but with Ozzy, I had to ask  him.  I had to.  My new album, it's called Shout at Ozzy, because I can't hear you.  Lenny, what's up?  That guy was fried.  Holy cow.  Like Norton said, I think he's on a cell phone, he's in a limo, he's racing to get to a helicopter, 
[01:53:00]  you know.  Unreal.  Anyway, you guys rock.  Keep up the good work, man.  All right, thank you, bro.  Ciao.  Bye.  Now I'm thinking of questions I should have asked him, I suck.  We knew we only had a few minutes with him, because somebody's suggesting Ozzy should  do books on tape.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, who's his opening act?  Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Hello, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  And the radio, pow.  All right.  Okay, brother. 
[01:53:30]  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Rich, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, boys, what's happening?  Hey, boys.  Listen, you guys, I hope you really replay this, because all I got was hello, helicopter, and  daughter.  You can never understand what Ozzy says, but the man's a legend and he's got great music.  We love, we love Ozzy.  He talks like that for real, though.  Yeah, he's great.  His kids are more smarter than he is.  Hey, I love my children.  I want to ask your face in another helicopter.  Ozzy Osbourne. 
[01:54:00]  The only word I understood is helicopter.  I was a helicopter.  People think it was fake.  That wasn't fake.  No, no, no.  People.  That was not fake.  You've got to understand something.  That was Ozzy Osbourne.  Wait, Ben, what are they saying on the S&P back?  They're like, oh, you guys have to make that a regular bit.  No, that was Ozzy.  That's funny.  We swear to you, that was Ozzy.  That was Ozzy, right?  Yes.  Of course it was.  God, that was so great. 
[01:54:30]  Semi-dry.  Semi-dry.  It's an occasional barrel of wine.  That's all I do now.  Well, I'm on the helicopter.  Helicopter.  How funny was that line?  I'm going to get a long eye on a whirly bird.  Box your wine, I won't go home.  Three rides, make a nap.  Mike, what's going on? 
[01:55:00]  What's going on, ONA?  What's up, man?  Nothing.  I was just ready for Ozzy to do a well-doggy.  Over and out, precious.  All right.  Helicopter.  God, it was just a quick five-minute little interview, and the people are losing it.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Trying to get past this.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, you guys can't kid me.  That was Andy doing his Arthur invitation, wasn't it?  You must have hated it, Moose. 
[01:55:30]  Don't you hate Perry's wife?  Highlander, get in the helicopter.  And people still, still, after we said that, still think that that was fake.  They're saying it was that other guy, Ozzy, that's called in.  No, no, no.  You guys are good Ozzy, but believe...  I believe it's an Ozzy.  No, we do have a guy that calls in and does a dead-on Ozzy, but I'm telling you, we set  this up through the record company.  He's hanging in our house with cheese.  You think he wants some cheese? 
[01:56:00]  In the helicopter?  John, what's up?  Hey, I think Norton just made him uncomfortable by telling him his uncomfortable story.  Yeah, that was a double uncomfortable with Ozzy.  I just had to tell him that, dude, because I was staring at him and he walked in where  I couldn't look at him anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great, man.  Greatest human alive.  That was memorable.  Come on, everybody.  Quick five-minute Ozzy interview is now memorable.  Steve, what's up?  So, you know, I got to tell you guys, Ozzy at an in-store last night, the guy was so 
[01:56:30]  unbelievably fried.  It was just hilarious.  I got a little loony news.  There's a gold, there's a mouth of it.  You can look up in the sky.  It's a bird.  It's a plane.  It's a helicopter.  With Ozzy Osbourne inside of it.  Bop.  Now it's fine.  No, it's not.  All right.  Jay Moore's a Jew.  Should I have had Ozzy say carpet muncher? 
[01:57:00]  Carpet muncher.  Carpet muncher.  That's great, man.  I can't wait for the Ozzy and Perry corner on MTV.  People loved Ozzy there.  But now people think, like, because he, like, stutters a little bit.  He's been doing that for 30 years.  I mean, that's not new.  Of course.  He's just get up on that stage and he kicks ass still.  Greatest.  All right.  Well, thank you very much.  I love it, too. 
[01:57:30]  Don't forget to buy it for the cockroaches decon foregone.  Spray it in your helicopter.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We can do an hour on this.  The phones are lit.  The Alty and Anthony Show.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week. 
[01:58:00]  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100. 
[01:58:30]  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  Hey, so for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Is that okay? 
[01:59:30]  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take the fees, the fees, the fees, the fees, a mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Uh, could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty. 
[02:00:00]  This might sound...  Work your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but do you have any girls that aren't that  attractive?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have jungle fever.  You have any black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time. 
[02:00:30]  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  But wait...  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your sister,  feel up your sister.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  You guys are awesome.  It's like...  I gotta listen to you.  It's like a drug.  It's Opie and Anthony, Cowbell Bill in the studio, and Anthony's brother Joe hanging  out for a bit here.  Sure.  212-757-1027 if you want in on the show.  Now, while we were in commercials, you were trying to say something about Marilyn Monroe.  Yes.  They just did a huge auction, made an S-load of money off her stuff.  Got like 8 million bucks auctioning off her goods.  And $42,000 paid for a few bikinis. 
[02:01:30]  They were selling her bikinis?  I didn't know that.  A set of bikinis, including a leopard skin print, bikini bottom, estimated at $2,000 to  $2,500.  But the whole set sold for $42,000.  I don't know who bought it, but you gotta know, right?  You're buying Marilyn's bikinis.  You gotta take the sniff.  Oh, come on.  You gotta take the sniff.  Come on in.  You're home, alone, finally out of the limelight for buying these things. 
[02:02:00]  You lay them out.  Get out of your cupboards.  Yeah.  You know, live with them a little.  And then you just bring one up and...  It's gotta smell like mothballs at this point.  Why, she's screwing much?  Smells like Joe D.  You know, the guy from the Home Shopping Network should have did that auction.  It would have been much more interesting.  Limited edition people.  Look at this bikini bottom.  Smells like Joe D.'s finger. 
[02:02:30]  V-dialing.  Look at this one.  It's stained people.  Obviously, this was before she could fly on the wings of a maxi.  Little bit of leaking.  What about the birthday dress, Home Shopping?  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Yeah, that dress.  When she sang that and allegedly had sex with him right afterwards.  Right.  Actual President's blues. 
[02:03:00]  DNA people, clone your own Kennedy with a head.  Oh, man.  Why?  We're all having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun, all right.  Isn't it common knowledge that Marilyn Monroe had a flatulence problem?  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  That bikini could tell.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Time out.  I never heard that before.  It is.  It's common knowledge.  Plenty of people said that she would, like, all the time be smart.  Ooh, Marilyn.  All the time. 
[02:03:30]  Imagine that.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Hey, Rob.  Whoa, that stinks, Marilyn.  I'm going to ditch you, but Bobby will take you.  Bobby.  Well, I guess some of those bikinis might show some telltale.  I'm so sorry.  You know, I think there's proof of that, too.  There's a picture. 
[02:04:00]  She wasn't standing over any air grate when her dress blew up.  That was all her, baby.  That was after White Castle, is what you're saying, Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and then she blew out the candles on the President's birthday cake.  Oh, my God.  My goodness, Marilyn.  Look at my head went back and to the left. 
[02:04:30]  Back and to the left.  That's the first shot I took to the head.  My God.  Were the candles still lit?  It blew the cake up.  Funny, I don't remember this being chocolate frosted.  Didn't Nelton John write a song about her problem? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, passing the wind, right?  Oh, my God.  I'm more frightened that you just found out you could do Marilyn Monroe's voice, Anthony.  I knew I could do that.  Do that again.  Come on.  Let's put on the hose back there.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Excuse me.  Happy birthday. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, sorry.  Ah, Marilyn, soon we'll be calling this the Brown House.  It looked like I rode my 10-speed bike through a mud puddle.  And clear up to my head.  I'm sure the guy that got those bikinis knows, and we can only speculate. 
[02:06:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  John Glenn will be the oldest man in space, but who knows?  Maybe in a few months they'll send Bob Hope up into space.  Hey, I got to tell you, this is Bob Where the Hell's the Grim Reaper Hope.  It's great to be here on the space shuttle.  Hey, that payload section's big enough for Charo's ass, isn't it? 
[02:06:30]  How about that Brooke Shields?  Hey, my eyes are bleeding.  Hey, is that a sunset or blood on my corneas?  I can't tell.  But I got to tell you, hey, how about that zero gravity, huh?  Hey, my ball sack's bouncing around like a hippity hop.  Ah, it's like I got a pound of melted Turkish taffy in my underwear.  Hey, John Glenn, pass the Viagra.  I got to take a leak.  Ah, can't even leak without Viagra. 
[02:07:00]  Ah, my prostate looks like the surface of the moon.  Ouch.  Hey, where's Susan Anton?  Hey, me and Bing are making a new film, On the Road to the Cemetery.  Ah.  Hey, from the space shuttle live, I want to say hi to my wife of 70 years, Dolores.  I don't want to say she's dry, but boy, that'd be a tough re-entry.  Ah.  She couldn't get wet in a rainforest.  Ah.  Hey, John, is that a black hole?  I haven't seen a black hole since I showered with Sammy Davis Jr. 
[02:07:30]  Ah.  Hey, my eyes look like two flaming meteors.  I don't want to say my eyes are shot, but...  Ah.  What's Morris, my wife?  Ah.  Hey, what's this missing control?  I'm still working on bowel control.  Ah.  My roids are hanging like tapestry.  Ah.  Hey, I gotta go, but you've been great on the space shuttle.  Thank you.  Oh.  Roger, mission control.  Get me out of here. 
[02:08:00]  That's not an umbilical cord I'm using on the spacewalk.  It's my bowels.  Ah.  So that's what it would sound like with Bob Hope in space, huh?  What?  What?  I missed it.  I was out of the room.  Yeah, where were you, Anthony?  You just missed it.  I had to use the laboratory.  Oh, okay.  Nude teen.  Oh, man, I want to get in her pants.  What did you just say?  Nude teen.  Oh, man, I want to get in her pants.  Call 911.  Hopey and Anthony.  Home of nude teen. 
[02:08:30]  I don't know how this show made it past the censors.  Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can, we take it to just about  illegal.  Daddy, I love when you touch my bed, please.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Adam Ferrara in the studio from The Job.  It's Adam Ferrara from The Job.  Oh, yeah.  From the Dennis Leary hit TV show The Job.  What happened to Adam Ferrara? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, the Hospitaliano guy from the Olive Garden commercial.  Adam's been on our show for many years.  We used to, you know, give the big intro.  Adam Ferrara from Social Studies.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  Oh, man.  Adam Ferrara from Adam.  Oh, Adam Ferrara from He Slept With My Sister.  Yeah, that one, too.  That was the first credit.  We just have some great intros for you.  But the latest is Adam Ferrara from The Job with Dennis Leary and the gang.  Adam was one of those rolling people in the Olive Garden commercials where they find some 
[02:09:30]  Italian, some young, aspiring Italian actor that's not willing to give a little oral  for a spot on a commercial.  And, yeah, you fit the bill.  You're a Dago.  So they threw you in front of that and you had to say,  Hospitaliano!  Yes, I did.  I like when he was Adam Ferrara and his college band, Date Rape.  Oh, yeah!  You had a band named Date Rape?  Oh, yeah.  For about ten minutes.  Sure.  Sublime ripped you off, man. 
[02:10:00]  Fine song, by the way.  Craig.  When do I get to pull out the Cue Me Your Brothers photo album of stupid things you did  in your year?  Yeah, it's all right.  You know, we were all trying there, Adam.  I still have Hungry Hearts tapes and...  Nice.  What's Hungry Hearts?  That was a bar.  Hungry Hearts is this bar that used to be...  I don't know where it was, but it was a bar they used to play.  Day Sons, which is now a post office.  It stunk.  Just sucked.  We have a call coming in.  Boat!  From L.A.  Something wrong with playing on a boat?  Megan!  Yeah, but it was a 12-foot-year-old boat. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, Megan, what's up?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Hi, um, I was...  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's okay.  You could speak.  This is Earl.  Megan?  Megan.  She's listening to herself.  Megan.  No, she can't be.  Megan.  Megan, you're calling from WB in California, right?  Yeah.  Well, that's not Megan.  Who are you?  Moody.  This is the...  She's freaking out.  She doesn't want to be on the radio. 
[02:11:00]  All right, who are you?  I'm Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Are there any other voices living in your head?  Yeah.  What does Megan want?  Yeah, why are you guys calling?  I'd like to talk to Megan.  Can Megan come out?  We're calling from an advertising agency in San Francisco, and we're trying to get some information.  What does WB mean?  Advertising.  Man, you blow away those stereotypes, my friend.  Thanks.  All right, what do you need to know?  We're all on the radio.  What do you guys want to know? 
[02:11:30]  What do we want to know?  Tell them what you want to know.  We want to know where you guys are syndicated at.  We're syndicated from New York.  New York.  We got that part.  Would you put the guy back on the phone, please?  Thanks.  We do our show from Chelsea.  You ever been to Chelsea?  It's Banff House Wednesday.  You ever been to New York?  No.  Oh, you'd love Chelsea.  You'd love the village. 
[02:12:00]  Really?  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  It's a smorgasbord of mules.  That's it.  Do you like the mule, sir?  Yeah.  Huh?  You guys are funny.  Do you like the mule?  No.  It's great stuff, the mule.  You would love the village where you can go jogging along the west side and see scantily-clad  young men walking their shih tzus.  Their shih tzus?  In their little shorts, their wedgie shorts.  Do you have a shih tzu?  No, I don't. 
[02:12:30]  It's the only place in the country that actually has knee pad rentals.  That's great.  All right.  So what do you guys need to know?  Where you guys are syndicated.  Like, do you guys run on any other stations in the country?  Yeah, about 15 others.  Yeah.  Really?  We're getting there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there someone that has, like, you guys get back to the list or something?  We're on a station in San Francisco.  Really?  Yeah.  You don't even know that?  You've got to be about five miles from the antenna, but we are syndicated there. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  What are the call letters?  I don't even know.  They're too small for us to bother with.  I see.  I don't think we've ever had a call from San Francisco.  Really?  No, it's KYCY.  KYCY.  1550 AM.  Just remember KY.  KY.  Yeah, thanks.  I remember that.  Too hard.  Anything else, my fine friend?  No, we're cool.  How are things in San Francisco?  Nice?  Yeah, they're actually pretty nice today. 
[02:13:30]  How's the nightlife out there?  Pretty lame.  Pretty lame?  What does an advertising executive do to blow off steam?  It's like you're getting kicked out of the same thing.  You've got to call steam.  They're like, steam, I'm ready.  Yeah.  So, what is...  All right.  Sorry.  All right, we'll let you go.  Are you dressed like you or Megan today?  Am I?  I'm wearing Megan's dress today, actually.  Yeah?  There you go.  Yeah.  No surprise.  When did you come out?  When did I come out?  Yeah.  About two, three years ago.  That's it? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Wow, so it's all new.  How old a guy are you?  Wow, we nailed it.  26?  Mm-hmm.  So you came out when you were, what, 24?  Yeah, about that.  So you're still a young gay guy out on the town going at it.  That's it.  That's rocks.  Laying in the sun like a young Indian brave.  Get it all now, because there's nothing sadder than an older gay gentleman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Queens don't age well.  No, they're all, look at Elizabeth.  Do you have good abs, sir?  Do I have good abs?  Yeah.  You got the six-pack?  You got the six-pack working? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I'm a gym bunny, thanks.  A gym bunny.  I've never heard that.  Anything with bunny in there.  It shivers up my spine.  Yum.  Mm.  What do you look like?  Sir, do your farts still make noise?  Yeah.  Funny.  Because I become gay doesn't mean I'm not a guy.  Right.  Absolutely.  That's what I say.  Hey, we enjoy the gay guys.  We're friends with gay guys.  Absolutely. 
[02:15:00]  We have a few gay friends, my friend.  Your friend?  Yeah.  We got, you ever see Mario Cantone?  No.  He's a hysterical comic.  Funniest gay comedian you'll ever see.  And he's not like a gay comedian.  He doesn't do all gay materials.  Funny than Charles Nelson Reilly.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  You like Charles Nelson Reilly?  Not really.  Ho-ho.  Rip Taylor?  He's funnier than Louie Anderson.  Ugh.  Who is just despicable.  How much do you think he has to pay for a fine, young, gay gentleman like yourself?  Yeah, on the Louie street, you'd get a fortune.  I wouldn't even want to begin to think about that. 
[02:15:30]  I bet.  Imagine that.  The young, gay hustler comes over his house.  He knows that a lot of money is going to be spent by Louie.  But then he opens the door and there's a big, fat, naked Louie.  Louie Anderson.  Hi.  I was just here to hopefully get some gay companionship.  You know, it's making up for a childhood of horror with my father beating me with whiskey bottles and whatnot.  And the children at school making fun of me.  You know, how to eat because of my low self-esteem and my enabling twat of a mother. 
[02:16:00]  But now you're here and we're going to play Gay Call Guy Feud.  All right.  The first question up is, what does Louie Anderson want in the balloon knot?  What is Louie Anderson?  We polled our audience for this survey.  What does Louie want?  Do you have an answer, sir?  Just hit the buzzer.  Isn't it funny?  You don't want to play? 
[02:16:30]  I'm going to play Family Feud now.  Let's see your junk.  There it is.  That's your junk.  That's what Louie wants in his balloon knot.  Thank you for playing the feud.  Now pull down your pants and suck it.  I love it.  You know, it's just a whole lifetime of horror until I got enough money to buy young gentlemen like yourself.  Come on in.  Come on in and taste of my from under cheese.  It's hard to watch. 
[02:17:00]  How much would it be for you to balance my b**** on your nose?  I'm talking about juggling balls.  Juggling balls.  Of course, like a seal.  I love the circus boys.  We lost our friend.  Where did he go?  I hope he didn't get insulted.  Oh.  Louie Anderson.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Louie.  How you doing?  Well, guys, I'm a little upset.  I hope you're flattered by my imitation, Louie.  I have to say, guys, I'm a little upset.  Why? 
[02:17:30]  Well, you forgot about my real passion in life.  What is that?  Well, as you recall, there was some negative media about me a while back concerning a black male.  Yes.  And if you're going to disparage me about liking the big boys, I'd at the very least like it for them to be big in the right area.  That was the black male thing.  But I thought it was black male, not black males.  Well, you see, if you ran your spell check, buddy, you'd find that there's a space.  I didn't know that. 
[02:18:00]  We thought the space was filled.  Unfortunately, not nearly enough.  That was hysterical.  Louie Anderson, a couple of years back, a story broke that he was paying money to some gay young gentleman not to come out in the media and say that Louie had paid him for sex.  Because we all thought Louie was just straighter than straight, I guess.  Louie, Louie, it's great.  Don't try to cover up things and spend good money covering up things everyone knows anyway.  And it was all Canadian money, if you have to know. 
[02:18:30]  Ah, it's worthless crap anyway.  Okay.  All right, Louie.  Who is that?  All right, Louie.  Can we turn the comedy back into tragedy, please?  Comedy into tragedy is very disgusting.  I have to see my parents, so I better go drown my sorrows in ho-hos and chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk and ho-hos.  And my companion that I have at my house now, I bought a bird, because I just love a cockatoo.  Mmm.  Or two, perhaps.  No, shut up, idiot. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, sorry.  Look, look, I said it right.  Louie says it wrong.  Well, that's why you're syndicated to 15 cities and I'm playing food.  Thank you, Louie.  Thanks.  My favorite bird is the cockatoo.  And I enjoy sitting with my favorite bird, a cockatoo.  Ooh.  Jimmy Stewart.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello, he's got me right there.  You had me at hello.  Yeah.  How's it going? 
[02:19:30]  What's up?  I want to say something to you.  All right, Jimmy.  There's millions of women out there with anthrax.  Millions?  At yesterday's show, you were saying jokes and all things about anthrax.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening.  I don't think it's funny.  I don't think it's funny.  You don't think it's funny.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I was watching the TV.  Yeah.  But I saw, I saw statistics.  Hello?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  And there's millions of women dying.  Of anthrax?  Oh, yeah.  Anthrax.  And I think, that guy, that man, what's his name?  Steve.  Steve.  Watch it.  He writes all his songs.  Stephen Lynch, yeah.  Oh, I think he should write a song saying, oh, his songs are lying, you see.  Hello?  Awesome.  Jimmy, you got to finish up here.  You're winding. 
[02:20:30]  You're just going on and on.  I don't think so, you see.  All right.  God bless America.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Who knew Jimmy Stewart would call him from the grave?  All right.  It reminds me, though, of that bit off that CD, May I Help You, Dumbass.  Right.  Remember, what's his name was in here?  We're talking to us.  Huh?  Matt Besser.  Yeah, Matt Besser.  Yeah, Matt Besser.  He did a bunch of these prank calls, and he did one as Jimmy Stewart.  Jimmy Stewart.  Basically, what, people were calling him instead of, like, a helpline for the computer?  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, he had a similar number to a computer helpline.  So, after a while of getting annoyed, he figured he'd just start taping him and F him with the people.  And here's him as Jimmy Stewart trying to help a sad soul out there.  Thanks, Floyd.  Oh, yes.  Hi.  I'm trying to get on the Barnes & Noble line, and I can't get on.  Oh, what's your problem?  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through and to call tech support. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, we've got to be more specific, but we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Great.  Okay.  So, did you enter your area code?  It seems to be entered already.  Right, right.  You're 212, right?  Right.  That's great.  Uh, let's just stick with me at this, and we'll turn this thing around. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  Great.  Okay.  Now, re-enter your area code.  Oh, God.  Cancel re...  Okay.  Um, all right.  Now, the problem is that I need probably to call you on my cell phone, because this isn't...  I have one line here.  All right.  Well, do you use your toolbar?  Yeah, I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you've got to use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem. 
[02:22:30]  We're going to get through this, though.  You've just got to keep your chin up.  Okay.  I hope so.  All right.  Turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  So, how do...  The toolbar's the thing at the bottom?  No.  Well, it could be at the top of the bar.  Do you have a Mac or a PC?  I have a PC.  I have a Dell.  Oh, that's good.  That's fine instrument.  I also have...  I have the disc.  You know, I have the...  The... 
[02:23:00]  Born to Noble disc.  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah, and it's...  Oh, with the disc.  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  It's not working.  Oh.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in?  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer.  You're going to have to restart your computer.  Okay.  So, you want me to just shut everything down here?  All right.  You have to push on the restart. 
[02:23:30]  You don't have to stick with me here.  Let's keep focused.  Where is that?  Keep focused here.  You have to write it down with a pencil.  Okay.  Where is it, though?  Oh, you don't have to turn off your computer, right?  Yeah.  You don't do it with a button, do you?  Yeah, I do.  What do you mean?  Well, there's a...  Okay.  I've got to go to shut down.  That's where your toolbar is.  You've got to grab all of it.  Okay.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  Oh, grab all of your toolbar.  I did.  You want me to... 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You've got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you've got to turn it off, but then you're going to say to restart.  Now, you check to restart.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying.  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  You've got to stay focused here.  You're going to lose your cool.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  You've got to just take a breath there.  Keep your chin up. 
[02:24:30]  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  So, I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So, I just...  I press restart.  Yeah.  Well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here.  I'm not...  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just...  You know, it's frustrating.  Yeah.  You know how...  Oh, is it rebooting?  Yes.  What's happening?  www.dell.com came up on my screen. 
[02:25:00]  So, it'll be a minute or two now.  Okay.  It's making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  The Barnes & Noble CD.  Is that good or should I take it out?  It'll CD-ROM, right?  Yep.  I want to stick a music CD in there.  No.  It's not a music CD.  I'm not joking.  No.  It'll break your computer.  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass. 
[02:25:30]  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that.  Throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Well, you know, try it.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend much time around horses, you end up making a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Where are you located now?  Uh, Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Oh, okay.  Well. 
[02:26:00]  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  That's right.  The 212.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around.  Yeah, but you got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Oh, well, I say you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out in there, you get out there, and you work.  You shove off that snow and turn things around.  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect. 
[02:26:30]  Yahoo!  Hee-haw!  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all in it!  Whatever.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard.  I guess before the weekend, the anthrax thing really started kicking up  because it turned up that NBC News, Tom Brokaw's, what was it, producer,  one of the production assistants or something, wound up getting some of the anthrax. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, the big egg.  Who's freaking out about this stuff?  Yeah.  It's a little weird, man, you know?  Every news story now, it's the top of every story.  Who's got the anthrax?  All the news agencies, the anthrax turned up.  They got a little baby now, seven-month-old kids.  Got the anthrax.  Imagine that.  Then your kid gets frigging anthrax.  Seven-month-old.  Seven-month-old.  That was at ABC.  Crawling around.  These studios are all around us, too. 
[02:27:30]  NBC is like five blocks that way.  Agency is about, what, then 10 to four blocks north.  Norton's used to children that age getting other communicable diseases,  but nothing like, some STDs, but nothing like the anthrax.  It just wipes right off.  Hello, Tom Brucker, NBC Nightly News.  I believe I have been exposed to the anthrax spores. 
[02:28:00]  That one of my productions is, I know I have opened up this,  uh, uh, uh, uh, em, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, letter.  A note.  No, sure.

[02:29:00]  real emotion until recently now you got dan rather crying uncontrollably on letterman when letterman  has to hold his hand and now you got broke off you know on friday completely pissed off  yeah he's freaking so but you know it's it's uh the guy might have anthrax you know that's got to  make you a little angry and he just pretty much found out about it and there he is on uh on the air  talking about it he went through his news thing and then at the end of the show he had a voice uh that
