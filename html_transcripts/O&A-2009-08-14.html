<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  It began with listener calls and a discussion about Michael Vick's return to the NFL after his dogfighting conviction, eliciting varied reactions ranging from disgust to acceptance.  This sparked a debate about the disproportionate public outrage towards animal cruelty compared to violence against humans.

Opie then recounted his frustrating experience on Sean Hannity's show, detailing disagreements and interruptions, but noting a pleasant encounter with Mike Huckabee.  The hosts joked about Opie's on-screen appearance, comparing him to a creepy school poster.  They also discussed the poor quality of amateur videos capturing significant events, using the helicopter crash and the Kennedy assassination as examples.  The discussion concluded this section with a detailed and opinionated debate surrounding the Harlem store owner, Charles Augusto, who shot two armed robbers assaulting his employee.  This was followed by a humorous, disgusted reaction to a scene from *Rocky IV*.  A recurring comedic segment involved awarding the fictional "Co-fucking-Cain" award.

The show continued with a humorous anecdote about a slow clap from someone resembling “Orchard” and a tense situation involving Russians.  True Boogie and Drew Boogie were both present in the studio with Drew providing musical breaks.  Further discussion of Opie’s planned appearance on Hannity’s show, with Opie's stated intent to "fuck him up,"  and mocking Regis Philbin's interview with Kate Gosselin was featured.  A significant portion focused on Bobo, a recurring character kept in a box despite being in the studio, whose new bit was teased.

Bill Burr called in, discussing his role in "Date Night," his career, and the upcoming New York Comedy Festival. He also weighed in on the Michael Vick situation. Patrice O'Neal joined the studio, expressing strong negative feelings about animal cruelty and engaging in a highly profane discussion about Michael Vick, apologies, public reaction, and racial implications.  Dante Stallworth's DUI incident was also discussed in this context.  Patrice O’Neal also mentioned upcoming shows.  A new video featuring "Super Agent Bob Eatman" on Opie's YouTube channel generated humorous and offensive listener comments, which were read on air.

The next segment included analysis of a YouTube video of Jimmy eating soup (with crude commentary), Anthony Cumia's confrontations with Sean Hannity (including discussions about Obama and voting), and Patrice O'Neal's confrontation with Sonia Osario of the National Association of Women.  The emerging Tea Party movement, racial dynamics, and societal reactions to political discourse were also debated.  Drew Boogie was again in the studio. The hosts frequently used vulgar and offensive language. This segment concluded with talk about an upcoming vacation and plugs for other shows.

A substantial portion of the show centered around planning a party for comedians, including discussions about guest lists featuring Bob Kelly and Jay Oakerson. Les Paul's death was briefly mentioned, seguing into a discussion of inventions and Black inventors.  Big Jay Oakerson and Pat from Minaki were in-studio guests.  The segment heavily featured calls to Bobo, accusations of lying, revelations about his personal life, and a discussion of a comedic video featuring Pat from Minaki. Bobo's personal life, sexual experiences, and relationship with Christina were discussed extensively, including crude jokes about his penis size and sexual performance.  The New York Mets' performance was also touched upon.

Finally, the show included a lengthy interview with Jamie, an intern for Kavino and Rich on Maxim Radio and Steve Kavino's cousin. The conversation was sexually suggestive, focusing on Jamie's dating life, appearance, and speculative sexual history.  Anthony's house was also discussed in detail. The hosts made numerous comments about Jamie's attractiveness and bra size.  Bobo was repeatedly mentioned.  Jeremy Piven was mentioned as having been put on hold and subsequently ignored. The show concluded with Jamie singing a song for Anthony, more banter, and promotion of upcoming appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let me go right to Ryan, who's been sitting there on the phone for about a half hour.  Ryan, what do you got for the show?  Call me fucking Kane.  Call fucking Kane.  Call fucking Kane.  Enjoy your vacation.  Thank you, Ryan.  There you go.  Brad in South Carolina. 
[00:00:30]  Happy birthday, man.  Call fucking Kane.  Can I hear Danny say again?  Call fucking Kane.  Yeah, good voice, Dan.  That's a good one.  Call fucking Kane.  That just brings fucking excitement to the show.  That's a great voice.  Well, what's great is these guys have been sitting on hold just to say that.  Just to say, call fucking Kane.  By the way, why is my Gatorade always piss warm?  It's just piss warm.  I want cold Gatorade. 
[00:01:00]  Attaboy.  I'm fancy.  I want a cup with ice in it now.  Quickly for the boss.  Cold Gatorade.  Cold Gatorade.  It's ridiculous.  Every day, I haven't said a word.  I figured, one day maybe it'll be cold.  You got to bitch.  You get a lot done when you bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then everyone thinks you're an asshole.  That's the other side of it.  Oh, I don't care.  But you still get a lot done.  The last thing I care about is what anyone fucking thinks.  Well, this guy's on the phone, too. 
[00:01:30]  What's your name, sir?  It doesn't have your name.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  What do you got?  I just wanted to find out what you thought of Michael Vick signing with the Eagles.  Well, that's a very good question, because there's a lot of people that are upset that  Michael Vick is playing football.  Absolutely.  I think you're listening to a radio show where we know everything, because we told you guys  that Michael Vick would have to sign with a dirty team.  An ugly team.  Yeah.  Not a nice team. 
[00:02:00]  And the Eagles are perfect for Michael Vick.  A two-year deal for Michael Vick.  I was thinking Raiders, because that is just a nasty, ugly team.  Oh, Raider gangbangers out there.  But the Eagles, hey, they're an ugly team.  They got ugly fans.  They're just nasty.  He fits right in.  A lot of people on Twitter, they're like, you know, they'll never forgive Michael Vick  because of what he did.  Yeah.  I don't give a shit what Michael Vick did.  Who cares?  I mean, when...  So does the Eagles.  Go Giants. 
[00:02:30]  Go Giants.  Well, go Jets, you motherfucker.  Fuck you, go Giants.  Go fuck yourself.  Wow.  Anger.  You're going to have to agree to disagree.  We'll see that one being resolved anytime soon.  That never works.  No, I don't know.  I mean, what he did with the dogs was completely disgusting, obviously.  Thank you.  I guess he did his time, so he should be able to play.  Absolutely.  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  Yeah, I don't believe there's actual morals in sports.  They try to throw morals at us, but it's bullshit.  It's a facade. 
[00:03:00]  And once you go to jail, you know what I mean?  It's like what he did was terrible, but once you go to fucking prison for it, it's like  you're done.  You went to prison, it's done.  Yeah.  You got to get the guy to make a living.  Also, there are people that are convicted of things like manslaughter and things like  that.  And they play and no one gives a shit.  Who's that lineman in the NFL who was convicted?  Dante?  No, no, no, no, no.  Dante Stallworth got suspended for the year.  It wasn't for drugs.  It was a guy who stole a felt hat.  I forget who that was.  He plays...  Boo!  Wrecking our sports discussion with a felt hat reference. 
[00:03:30]  Jimmy has a hat fetish.  Who doesn't?  There's something about hats with Jimmy.  He stole it.  It was in his pocket, and they searched him at the airport.  Found a hat.  It's a two-year deal, not a one-year deal, I believe, right?  Not a one-year deal.  It's a one-year deal?  With an option for two.  Oh, that's crap.  That's two years.  Trust me.  You better be good.  Trust me.  That option...  Whatever.  Don't get me started.  Dante Stallworth out the entire season because of his DWI manslaughter conviction.  Jesus.  But Michael Vick gets to play for the Eagles. 
[00:04:00]  That's a strong move by the Eagles.  But there's never any real outrage when somebody comes back from manslaughter.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Because people, I guess, care more about little puppies than people.  Yeah.  So...  Yeah.  But when that hit the wire, people went, holy shit.  Yeah, that was a biggie.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, he went to jail.  Fuck it.  What are you going to do?  Keep the guy from making his livelihood?  I think it'll be fun to watch as he plays some of these teams. 
[00:04:30]  They're going to come out of the woodwork screaming and yelling at Michael Vick.  Oh, yeah.  Let the dogs out.  We'll plan that.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  We get it.  I bet you the Browns really wanted him, but they're like, there's no way we could do  this.  We can't.  We'd have to change the little mascot.  We can't have the dog pound anymore.  We can't have Michael Vick on our team if we have something called the dog pound.  Uh, this guy is saying, uh, Jimmy James from PA. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, uh, you got to feel for McNabb because Philly is going to be in turmoil.  Yeah.  They begged for McNabb to be pulled all year last year when they had some no-name shit  bag as a backup quarterback because those fans just never appreciated him.  And now they have Vick sitting on the bench.  There's just going to be turmoil.  They're going to be begging for Vick all year.  And McNabb, McNabb just can't wait in that goddamn town.  Yeah, it'll be interesting.  But, I mean, are they, I mean, Michael Vick, they're not even attempting to play him at 
[00:05:30]  quarterback.  I mean, they could do the old switcheroo, I'm sure, later on in the season.  But, uh, yeah.  They're saying that now, but you know, as soon as they lose two games in a row, they're  just going to be calling for McNabb's head.  Good point.  I like how you said there'll be turmoil in Philly.  It's Friday.  There's turmoil in Philly, okay?  It doesn't matter.  What are you nuts?  I mean, it's a game that isn't why.  Fucking Philly for the UFC 101.  Oh, my God.  Every time there was a black fighter versus a white fighter, it was so ridiculously racist. 
[00:06:00]  Of course.  They were booing the black guy, cheering on the white guy.  Although, uh...  Good old Philly.  Although Silva did turn him around, because he got booed like crazy, and when he, uh,  when he knocked out Forrest Griffin, they did cheer for Silva by the end of that fight.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Okay.  No, no, go ahead, go ahead.  I thought you were done.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say at the end of that fight that, uh, Silva, take the mic and say,  If we can change! 
[00:06:30]  If we can change!  Punch it up, bro.  Then maybe the whole world is change!  That stupid fucking speech.  Oh, God.  Fucking speech.  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!  They're all chanting for Rocky, and then that guy that had a career because he looked  like Gorbachev.  Yeah.  That actor that played Gorby in every fucking bad movie.  Dude, my fucking back is tingling right now, remembering that scene. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  What we saw here tonight was a change, and if we could change you, maybe the whole world  could change!  Shut up!  Oh, I hope your fucking stupid wife drops another load on the pet floor, pet shop floor.  Hope she falls on the feed while Butt just fucks her face.  Can we get a cup and link on each nipple? 
[00:07:30]  It's terrible.  She used to cuff and link his nipple clips.  Yeah.  His little turtles.  When Adrian would fall asleep, they would bite her nipples like little alligator clamps.  She would wake up crying.  We gotta get that speech now.  Let's say hi to Bill in Arizona.  Oh, please find that stupid speech.  Bill!  Look at Danny Rules.  Hold on a second.  I can't go both places.  Hello, Bill!  Bill, what's up?  Hello.  You know, seriously, I don't know why anybody really gives a flying fuck whether Michael 
[00:08:00]  big's playing football or underwater fucking basket weaving.  Ooh.  The fact of the matter is, we're the only country in the goddamn world that treats dogs like  they're part of the fucking family.  Thank you.  They eat them, and Europe fucking uses them as tools.  I mean, you can kill a fucking human.  Guys, right.  Bullshit.  This country is weird, man.  Our priorities are weird.  There are.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe faggy France, and stupid England.  What other countries treat dogs as well as we do? 
[00:08:30]  And I know there's plenty of fucking dogs running around that are emaciated and treated  like shit and put in dog fighting and everything, but when you think about it, people treat  dogs like part of the family.  They have a house.  I would bet there's more dogs in this country that are treated like shit, by the way.  It's a perception.  Oh, I think you're right.  I think there's a ton of dogs out there that are being treated like shit.  Oh, I think you're right.  I'm just saying that when people have dogs, they treat them like part of the family.  They have steady eats. 
[00:09:00]  They got a roof over their head.  Companionship they're played with and everything.  It's just a weird thing.  I don't think that's weird.  I think that's fine.  I think that where the weird thing is that we actually treat, we care about dogs more  than our fellow human beings.  When you see a horrible dog story, it bothers you more than a horrible human story in a lot  of cases.  Well, look at movies.  Just look at them.  That's what I'm just saying.  They really are magic.  During vacation, just go to a movie.  No, look at movies. 
[00:09:30]  Usually, animal or dog deaths in movies test very poorly in movies, and they usually show  the dog didn't die or some weird twist.  Yeah, it pops up at the end and runs away.  But there can be just a body count that's immeasurable.  And that's fine.  Dogs are probably seen like kids in the way that they're innocent.  Yes, retarded children, I believe.  Well, one of the biggest cop-outs was in, was the movie with the divorce there, Michael 
[00:10:00]  Douglas was in it.  War of the Roses?  War of the Roses.  Thank you.  There was a dog in that movie?  War of the Roses, yeah.  And the wife made like she cooked the guy's dog and fed it to him.  And it was like one of those holy shit moments where, oh my God, that is as far as you can  go in hating another human being.  Sure, sure.  And then they had to show the dog pop its head up out of the bushes, like it didn't  really happen.  Because initially they had run it that way in front of a test audience, and the audience 
[00:10:30]  like free, they couldn't handle it.  They could not fucking handle the fact that she cooked his dog.  Now what's so weird about that, like it doesn't happen either way.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like if they're filming a movie, they're not actually feeding a dog to an actor.  But the story, they can't handle the storyline.  But they can't handle the story.  But you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want in movies, because you're not  really doing it.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  Like they never did, fed the dog to the guy. 
[00:11:00]  No.  But they had to show the dog popping up anyway in the yard to prove, see this, this acting  dog is still alive.  Doggy actor's still okay.  So stupid.  Do you know how many things have been ruined?  Like Oedipus mentioned with BCN focus groups.  Fucking focus groups ruin everything.  Let the artist or the director, whatever they see is what it should be, they're the creative  ones.  Let them do it.  Yeah.  There's just got to be another outlet for that type of stuff.  That's all.  Oh, because they're finicky focus groups. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, because they're scared.  There's too much money at stake.  So they got to make sure, okay, we're not going to offend this group or that group.  Because if we offend this group, then they're not going to come see the movie.  They're scared.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Are you kidding me?  My dog is resting comfortably on my $2,000.  What?  Steve in Tampa.  Steve.  Hey, O&A.  What's up?  Yeah, me.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, right now my Labrador is resting comfortably on my $2,000 leather couch and very happy about  it, I must say.  That's wonderful. 
[00:12:00]  Isn't that great?  Do you mind?  There's a little dog ass right there on your couch.  Some people don't mind, though.  Do you mind, Steve?  Just leaving puckered little dog ass prints on your couch.  Let's go to Jesse in Nebraska.  Jesse.  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  I'm good, Jesse.  Hey, I was wondering, will the fans throw puppies at Michael Vick whenever he throws an interception?  Oh, wow.  I would imagine this is going to be a lot of stuffed animals being thrown onto the field. 
[00:12:30]  No, I'm thinking.  Real puppies.  People bring puppies and just hurl them out of the stands onto the field.  Holy shit.  I love how Jesse had to clear it up.  No, I mean real puppies.  I mean real puppies just throwing puppies.  Well, we are talking about Philly.  Yeah.  That is true.  Philly's going to come alive with this.  I'm telling you.  They're going to be out of their minds today.  I got a bunch of text messages actually last night.  But they could give a crap what he used to do in his spare time. 
[00:13:00]  They can't wait to see him in an Eagles uniform.  All right, Jesse.  Thank you.  By the way, I was on Hannity last night.  Yeah.  Why is this guy saying?  Yeah.  I mean, we don't have to get in depth with it.  But hey, Rich.  Yeah.  What happened last night?  That liberal was walking all over you.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  What happened?  I fucking, I destroyed that guy at every turn.  Every fucking turn.  Every, all night, all I was getting was Twitters and reading how I fucking nailed that guy. 
[00:13:30]  And I destroyed him.  And you're the first person that has said I let him walk all over me.  Example.  He was walking.  Every time you had a point to make, he was interrupting you and he was talking over you.  No.  How about the fucking, oh, when the whole thing came up with Obama and who the fuck came  up with the idea of government run, wow, I am tired, of government run health care. 
[00:14:00]  Who the fuck cut him off right there?  Man, you did.  But you know what he was doing?  And he's pulling that Sharpton move on you where he's like, no, you're wrong, you're  wrong.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Anybody that watched that saw it differently.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Who was it, Ant?  I didn't see it.  Some liberal guy.  You don't know his name? 
[00:14:30]  Why would I know his name?  Well, we're cutting up the appearance, so we'll find out for ourselves, Rich.  But I did meet Huckabee.  Oh, Mike Huckabee?  Yes, Mike Huckabee.  Seems like a nice gentleman.  You on with him?  Well, he was on earlier.  He had like a one-on-one interview.  So you were on with some liberal guy?  Who else?  And some broad...  Oh, cool.  You never know their names.  I never know either.  Why do I know their names?  No, he's like, you know, liberal guy.  I call him liberal guy.  Well, we'll get the audio very soon.  It's the sacrificial lamb, actually, that they put on there. 
[00:15:00]  Well, yeah.  He's in the Kobayashi Maru, is what it is.  That's why I don't feel like going on that show.  Oh, Hannity doesn't stop with you, man.  I don't feel like going on that show and being way...  I'm not...  I'll be completely honest.  I'll be in way over my head.  I don't give a shit about politics that much.  And, of course, he would go with that, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, right at me.  Sean wants you on so bad.  And I would rather talk about some other shit.  He wants you on so bad.  To do what?  Beat me up?  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  He just keeps saying.  To try to convince me that I need to be a right-wing Republican?  I'm fine right where I'm at.  I told him, you know, because he said, he goes, you're not really a...  I said I'm not really far-right, conservative, Christian right.  I go, I have ideas that lean on.  I go, I'm not quite left.  I go, I'm more center.  Right.  You know?  I'm center.  Yeah.  I'm a moderate.  He wants you on that show.  I know.  It's not happening.  Oh, boy, does he want you on that show.  Do you do any reconnaissance on why certain people keep getting bumped? 
[00:16:00]  No, they actually, not why people get bumped, but they said to say hello.  They love having you on the show.  Well, we'll see.  I love the telling we said hello.  That's the worst.  That's not going to make Jimmy feel better.  But they did.  We were talking about Jimmy and how great he is.  When the cameras were off, what did he say about me?  He said, get OB on the goddamn show.  That's what he said.  All right, what are we going to talk about?  I don't think he'd beat you up because he likes you.  I'll talk golf with him.  Yeah, he golfs. 
[00:16:30]  I'll talk music.  Yeah, I'll talk videos.  I ain't going to talk that political shit.  So, dude, make fun of the whole process.  Like, if you don't want to talk about the politics, just goof on the whole thing.  Like, just make it like, eh, you could certainly play it that way.  You could actually sit there and go, oh, here's where Sean goes at the liberal guy.  All right, go ahead, Sean.  Do your thing and, like, totally throw a monkey wrench into the works.  Boy, it's like you know me or something.  That would be hysterical.  OB just throws a monkey wrench into the whole works. 
[00:17:00]  Or completely misrepresent everything he says.  Like, if Hannity goes off on something, go, you're right, Sean.  And I know that typically you're for a gay marriage, so let's completely misrepresent him.  But my proudest moment on Hannity was when he was doing it with Combs.  Oh, yes, yes.  See, I am a seer.  I mean, you guys just got to start realizing that.  So, Ed and I are on Hannity and Combs.  And Hannity completely controlling the TV show, you know, back when he was doing it with Combs.  Yeah.  And Hannity, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:17:30]  And we're talking and, you know, having a nice conversation with Hannity.  And all of a sudden, Combs pipes up.  And I turn around.  I don't even listen to what he said.  I go, oh, oh, oh.  What did I say exactly?  You said, oh, Sean lets you talk?  Or something like, oh, fuck, I don't remember my line now.  Oh, it talks?  Or, oh, oh, you talk?  Something.  Ah, fuck.  It was very nasty.  It was nasty, yeah.  And he gave me a look like, fuck you.  Where do you want to go with this?  It looked like Sidney Friedman from that last night.  Sidney Friedman. 
[00:18:00]  People don't like my David Niven mustache.  Oh, your mustache on TV is fucking high.  You look like every fucking creepy poster by a school.  You know what?  Do not get into a van driven by this fucking Errol Flynn creep.  Errol Flynn.  You know what?  I'm kind of with Jimmy.  Like, in person, it looks fine.  But something with the TV, I don't get it.  Yes, I know.  I don't know what to do.  I'll cut it off.  No, but right here it looks fine.  But on TV, I don't know what the, I don't know if it's the lighter or what.  When I used to, we used to Ant's hat, when his hair slicked back, I tweeted a picture of Ant on Hannity the first time he was on, 
[00:18:30]  and he looks like a guy defending marriage between adult males and small boys.  He looks like a creepo.  Well, I didn't have it slicked back last night.  It was a little poofy last night.  It's growing a little more, so it was a little poofy.  So I was able to ace the hat and take that off.  And then put my little, I shaved the mustache down so it wasn't so big.  But I don't know.  Yeah, there's something about just TV that just, I'm a creep. 
[00:19:00]  Come back with the goatee.  I don't know what to do.  Do a little old school.  It got too much gray now.  It's fucking quiet.  Not the medicine.  Margaret.  No.  Robert Kelly did the medicine for a while.  Then you caught up.  God, the worst thing was seeing Lemmy from Motorhead, and he uses the medicine, but he let it grow out.  Yeah.  So you see, like, the whole tips of the hairs are black, but then the roots of the beard hair is gray.  Yeah.  That happened to Dice, too, one day when he was in here. 
[00:19:30]  His big pork chop sideburns, just the tips were black and the roots were all gray.  It's like, no, just shave it.  But the problem is, he came in, it was completely black.  By the end of his appearance, the gray was already appearing.  He has already coming back.  What's up with facial hair?  I just shaved, and I got, like, look.  Big pain in the ass.  Unbelievable.  I wanted to get that picture of Ant on Hannity.  I know.  Danny, I tweeted one a while ago.  Is there any way we can go back and grab the rope?  There was one from last night.  Oh, you got one from last night?  Or somebody tweeted one from last night, but, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Sean Hannity called me a pussy and a bedwetter?  Oh, yeah?  A bedwetting liberal is what it's called.  Did he call me that again?  It's like a tree hugger or a bedwetting liberal.  He didn't call me that on the show, did he?  Just behind the scenes?  Oh, no, no, on the show, at the beginning of the show.  He said, where is Opie, that bedwetting liberal?  Last night?  Yes.  I know exactly where he lives.  Oh, hell.  I'm coming.  You sound like one of our listeners to me.  I'm coming with my crew.  I'm a ghoul. 
[00:20:30]  Let me see.  The hair looks better, but you just look weird.  Well, I'm making a fair.  I took this picture.  I'm not used to seeing you without your hat, Ant.  I know.  That's not that bad.  No, he looks fine.  The hair's a bit poofy.  Errol Flynn.  You got some poofy hair.  Errol Flynn.  You know, Anthony?  Anthony's a swarthy character.  No, I want TV.  I just don't want political TV.  I can't be bothered.  That's all the rage now.  You should just make fun of it. 
[00:21:00]  Make fun of the whole process.  Maybe.  I don't mind talking politics, but sometimes it gets a little too...  Yeah, you guys are way more in than me.  But it's like sometimes it gets too much for me, and just make fun of the whole thing.  Like, goof on it or just completely misrepresent what the person's saying.  Oh, I guess you enjoy paying taxes.  I do.  Yeah, I do, Sean.  That's why.  That's why I lean more Democrat.  Yeah, you're right.  So, you're Gaia Obama, Opie.  Your boy Obama.  What do you think about the health care and these town hall meetings where people are outraged at this? 
[00:21:30]  What do you think?  You're right, Sean.  You're right.  Our president's retarded.  I'm sorry for thinking differently.  God bless the people that could get into those political debates and fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.  It's just fun.  Yeah, it's exhausting.  It's just fun to like...  It's exhausting, because I hate being in any type of argument where you can't turn the other person.  No, there's no turning the other person.  When you have a disagreement with someone, you could maybe find some common ground or something. 
[00:22:00]  Not in politics.  When the other person talks, all you hear is white noise.  During the commercial break, the guy actually...  I like that.  Is that the black guy you were on with?  I like him.  No, that was last time.  Okay.  Yeah, that was last time.  I've done it with him.  He's a nice dude.  Yeah.  You've done it with him?  Big cock?  Mine was actually bigger.  People were more ready for his to be bigger, and they were surprised.  That's the slicked back hair.  Oh, they're fucking cool.  Holy shit.  That's the slicked back hair, Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Holy shit.  That was the last time.  Mr. File?  Mr. File!  That was the last time you were on.  Wow.  Fucking Anthony.  Wow.  Anthony.  Your hair is way better now.  Yeah, it's grown in.  Way better.  It was just starting to really grow in there, but I couldn't poof it or curl it.  It wasn't growing in curly yet, is what the problem was.  It looks like an in-between shoot interview with John Holmes in like 1975.  That's the look I was going for.  Thank you. 
[00:23:00]  That is a John Holmes interview.  Unbelievable.  That really is hysterical.  Pedophile.  Well, I can't wait to get the audio from your appearance.  We're going to have it in a few minutes.  We've got to move on.  That's terrible.  What a creep you look like.  Do I just look creepy?  We've got to move on because we've got way too much shit.  Oh, I love it.  But we're going to go back to the Hannity thing when we get the audio.  Absolutely.  All right.  We did the Vic thing.  Pretty much a two-year deal.  One year with an option.  They're very excited in Philly, and there's a lot of outrage and blah, blah, blah.  And we'll see how this plays out, okay? 
[00:23:30]  Good luck to you.  Do you want to do this or the video?  I like that guy.  Really?  Okay.  Well, we've got the helicopter video.  I haven't seen that.  You'll see it.  It's pretty much on every TV station.  It's being played everywhere.  That broke yesterday afternoon.  But you knew there was going to be one.  That's amazing in today's day.  Nothing really happens.  Yeah, I don't think anything happens without it being on someone's fucking video, the phone  or camera or something.  They missed the Sully landing. 
[00:24:00]  But there was a camera.  They did have video of it actually touching down the water.  Yeah, there was video.  There is video.  I guess what I should have said, they should have had much better video than what we ended  up seeing.  Dude, the first plane hit the towers, they got two shots of.  Like, it's amazing to me that there is...  Well, the helicopter thing, I'm so pissed off by...  I'm assuming it's a woman, and maybe that's bad for me to say.  Yeah.  But if you've seen the footage of the helicopter and the plane, she's got it.  I'm going to say she. 
[00:24:30]  She's got it.  You see the helicopter go crashing into the plane, pretty much chopping it in half.  Next thing you know, she goes something like, oh, that's terrible.  And now she's filming the bottom of the boat that she's on.  People don't think.  Like, they want to watch it, but don't think.  Maybe they ought to record this.  Because she's like...  It hits, and it's obviously now going to fall into the Hudson River.  And the next shot, she puts the camera down, and now you're seeing the floor of the boat  she's on.  Thanks for nothing.  Dude, nothing you do goes on. 
[00:25:00]  It's like, you can't even be a fucking kid toucher talking about pirates without  somebody capturing it.  Well, look at that picture.  Wait a minute.  That was my last appearance.  But you really can't do anything without it being caught by soda.  But you wanted to...  What did you do after?  But fine.  She caught the impact, but then she completely blew it.  You'll see.  So many people will be frustrated when they see this footage.  Like, oh my God, what was wrong with you?  Why couldn't you continue with your videotaping?  I got scared.  Because obviously you knew that the end result was it was all going to end up in the river. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  So why wouldn't you show that?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Guys on the news now, the Harlem business owner...  Yeah, we're going to say that.  Dude, we're going to say that.  Tough cookie.  But the video thing, Jimmy, you made a good point with the Kennedy assassination.  The most frustrating case of should have gotten it was while JFK was being assassinated,  there was a woman shooting the motorcade as it came.  She was in the book depository.  And then she was starting... 
[00:26:00]  Book's depository, Bill.  Yeah, knock it off.  And then she started filming in the direction that Kennedy was traveling as he was shot.  She was under the floor where Oswald was, or two floors lower.  She didn't know how to operate a video camera, so when the shots rang out, this fucking dumb  bitch is looking out the window and filming the treetops.  She missed the whole assassination.  Can you see her videotape?  Oh, yeah, you can YouTube it.  Her video, whatever?  You absolutely can.  I forget what it's called. 
[00:26:30]  Did her videotape pick up the shots from Oswald?  I don't remember what audio she had, if any.  Because, again, that was 62, I guess.  Could have just been one of those little 8mm cameras with no sound.  Yeah.  You just show people waving a lot.  She would have gotten it.  There's a few films of it.  I think there's actually three films of the assassination, but she would have had one from the angle  Oswald was at.  And the footage starts off good, where she's got Kennedy in frame?  I think so.  She's got the motorcade coming towards her.  Yep.  Before it made the left turn.  She was a corner building, so you just go the other way, and boom, it starts going down. 
[00:27:00]  And she just blew it.  Oh, dude, it's the fucking worst.  Maybe one of the listeners knows what hers is called.  Right.  Here.  This is the plane, and then the collision.  Oh, my God!  You can hear the sheer horror of those who witnessed this fatal crash.  The person who shot this footage is on the circle line.  How frustrating is that?  They're on the circle line.  But how frustrating is that?  She gets the impact and then puts it on her friend's shoulder. 
[00:27:30]  It's then on a woman's back.  Because she had to go, oh, she had to put her hands to her face.  Oh, my God!  And that meant that the camera was going to now kind of fall down to the right,  and now she's filming whoever was in front of her.  Suck it up her back.  Hey, look, I will say this.  At least she got the impact.  I mean, look, as much as she should be kicking to the water.  Let me see it again.  But look.  Woman, you see a plane, and then the collision.  Oh, my God!  You can hear the sheer horror of those who witnessed it. 
[00:28:00]  And she shakes as it hits you.  She really does stink.  The person who shot this footage is on the circle line ferry.  He focuses on the helicopter.  Hey, hey.  Oh, boy.  It's the guy.  Sorry to every woman listening to our show.  I apologize.  Oh, sorry.  God, what a fucking asshole.  Shaky Sam.  Yeah.  He's a loose he, if you know what I mean.  God damn this thought of him.  But investigators have the necessary clues as to what went so wrong that day.  How do you not continue filming? 
[00:28:30]  But then he shakes.  It's perfectly steady until a quarter second before it hits you.  Yeah, before an impact.  And then it starts shaking.  Yeah, then it hands into Katherine Hepburn.  Mr. Fox took this video.  All right, why don't we get into the story of the day?  This fucking store owner.  If you can find that.  Sorry.  If you can find that.  Just look for a Canadian assassination from.  I don't know what it's called.  Yeah, I want to see that, too.  You're going to want to dig this woman up and just kick her in the shins.  You know what?  We haven't read a whole story in a long time.  But it's.  Who wants to do some reading today? 
[00:29:00]  Readings for queers.  I'm a great reader, though.  I was voted boy most likely to read publicly.  Dude, you got.  I was.  You want to be voted.  Oh, yes, I did.  I competed for years for that.  Oh, you did?  I certainly did.  Well.  You got a store owner in Harlem.  Blast four robbers, killing two.  The other two are in pretty bad shape.  Old white guy owns a restaurant supply company.  Yeah.  And, man, this guy wasn't going to take any guff.  No, he wasn't. 
[00:29:30]  He went old school.  By the way, Ant, because I'm not sure if you know this.  I love stories like this.  For real.  I'm not a big gun guy like yourself.  But when I see, like, a store owner guy fighting back and blasting everyone in sight, I'm a big fan of the store owner.  One for the good guys.  I'm a major fan of the store owner.  That's good, because that could have just been a story that was on page fucking, you know, 12 that just said, oh, yeah, store owner killed.  Right.  Employees killed in robbery of blah, blah, blah.  And you'd be like, oh, okay, this is this one is, oh, wait, what happened? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, I just like to think what the mindset is of the robbers when that happens.  The second it starts turning bad, like the thought of, like, holy shit, wait a minute, this wasn't supposed to go like this.  Right.  I'm supposed to go in, get some money, fucking leave.  We're supposed to laugh.  Everything's supposed to be good.  Well, but now I'm bleeding profusely, and my friend is dead, and all four of them he got. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  What a good.  Let's, we don't have to read the whole thing, but pump action ending.  Two robbed suspects dead and two shot by storekeep with a shotgun.  A shotgun-wielding owner of a Harlem restaurant supply company blasted two robbers to death and wounded two others yesterday when he caught them pistol-whipping his employee, police said.  Turning the tables on the bandit, 72-year-old Charles Augusto opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun he kept handy for such occasions.  Just such an emergency.  The cops and witnesses knew that. 
[00:31:00]  He was robbed before, so people aren't totally amazed that he took this type of action.  They ran into some tough stuff today, witness Vernon McKenzie, 48, said of the stick-up man, including one whose bloody corpse was splayed.  I've never seen that word before, splayed.  Just kind of thrown with arms and legs akimbo.  Sure.  Splayed on the sidewalk in front of Augusta's store on West 125th Street near Amsterdam.  The robber stormed into the business.  Kaplan Brothers, Blue Flame, just after 3 p.m., demanded cash. 
[00:31:30]  He did a large cash business, a police source said.  They were probably watching the place.  A police force?  Police source?  Horses can't talk.  That's crazy.  They just go, and they eat oats.  Police force.  And they have giant penises.  There's a lot of words.  I'm trying to read real fast.  He did a large cash business, a police source said.  They were probably watching the place and made a move after a cell.  Neighbors said Augusta, who was not charged last night, had sold a stove earlier in the day. 
[00:32:00]  He sold a stove.  I like using the oofen.  Stove.  Stove.  My favorite bird is the bird of peace, a dove.  Holy shit.  That's great.  You know, when I started reading this, I'm like, wow, I'm reading pretty good today.  That's all right.  Because the stove is fine.  That's stuff.  Holy shit.  I sold a stove earlier in the day.  The stick-up crew, three 21-year-olds and a 29-year-old. 
[00:32:30]  Do we know the race of the victims?  Not that they should be called victims.  Yes.  The perps?  The perps, yes.  I don't know yet.  Well, they're not mentioning what they were.  I'm going to guess black or Hispanic just because of where it was.  The location.  125th in Amsterdam and Harlem.  Yeah.  You could have white criminals there.  It's just less likely.  You'd have to be crazy to be a white criminal up there, I think.  Yeah.  Three white guys running with guns.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, you got four.  They came prepared with a pistol and plastic handcuffs.  They tried to tie up two of Augusta's employees. 
[00:33:00]  The male employees started to struggle.  And then, as he did that, the perp with the gun struck him once in the head.  Now, this is where the story gets great.  Yeah.  That's when the owner opened fire with the shotgun.  Cocaine!  That is extreme.  As the bandits bolted from the store, Augusto squeezed off three blasts from the pistol grip shotgun.  Is that a nice gun, Ant?  Well, it's probably an old one with the butt sawed off. 
[00:33:30]  I just pictured this guy with an old one with the butt sawed off and the pistol grip handle.  Yeah.  How far away are they accurate, too?  He got all four guys.  A shotgun?  You get a little more leeway with a shotgun.  Yeah.  That's spraying some shit.  Yeah.  But isn't it hard to get off four quick shots?  Like, you have to pump each one, right?  This guy's probably pretty good.  Yeah.  He got four shots off before they could run out the door.  Well, he squeezed off three blasts from the pistol grip shotgun from 20 to 30 feet away from the pistol whipped employee. 
[00:34:00]  Here we go.  He was deadly accurate.  The four bandits who were all from Manhattan were hit.  Two of the robbers were struck in the back.  One dropped dead inside the store among the sparkling gas stoves.  A pistol near his body.  How great is that?  The other, a nephew of a cop in the NYPD.  Oops.  Made it across the street before collapsing on the sidewalk.  Police and witnesses said he was later pronounced dead at St. Luke's Hospital. 
[00:34:30]  The furious employee, this is where it's unbelievable, who had been pistol whipped, ran out of the store and leaned over the mortally wounded bandit cursing at him, witnesses said.  The worker went back into the store and dragged the other dead thief onto the sidewalk.  Okay, so this wasn't the shooter.  I thought it was the shooter.  This was one of the employees that were being pistol whipped.  Yeah, it was being pistol whipped.  Okay.  It wasn't the shooter.  I think the shooter also did it.  Okay.  The worker went back into the store and dragged the other dead thief onto the sidewalk, yelling at him and kicking him. 
[00:35:00]  He stood over the body, cursing him and shaking him.  The guy's dead and bleeding, just bleeding.  And he's shaking the guy.  And he goes, uh, wait a minute.  Okay.  He stood over the body, cursing him and shaking him, even though he was dead.  He was screaming at him and stomping him.  He said, you were going to kill me.  Well, now you're dead.  Nice.  Jesus.  And then ran over to Gus and said, you saved my life, blah, blah, blah.  It goes on and on.  So, basically, Augusta bought the shotgun after a robbery nearly 30 years ago. 
[00:35:30]  Nearly 30 years ago?  So, 30 years ago, he was robbed.  He said, fuck that.  That's never happening again.  Oh, if that's a 30-year-old shotgun, yeah, I'm sure it was nice sawed off.  Yeah.  Probably kept it all nice right there for just such an occasion.  Now, they're not sure if he has a license for the weapon.  Uh, let me see.  Yeah, in New York City, you need a license to even have a shotgun or a rifle.  He's not been arrested or charged. 
[00:36:00]  A police source said that if Augusto is hit with a charge, it will be a minor one.  It doesn't look too bad for him, the source said.  Yeah, handguns are one thing.  A shotgun, I think you, I don't, I'm not sure if you need a license for it, but I think it has to be registered.  I think you have to have it registered in New York.  A handgun's a bigger charge, though?  A handgun, uh, yeah, a handgun is, if you're not licensed to own a handgun in New York City, it's a mandatory two-year sentence.  And, uh, shotgun's another thing.  It might be grandfathered in, though. 
[00:36:30]  If he's had it for 30 years, uh, I'm not sure what the laws were 30 years ago in New York City, but, uh, you could be allowed to have it.  And a guy protecting his store is probably a little different than your store owner protecting your store.  Well, look at, uh, crazy Bernie Getz, you know?  He didn't, he didn't get in trouble for, um, shooting.  And he shouldn't have.  Anybody.  He got in trouble for, on a weapons charge.  Because he's your weapon, right?  Yeah.  And, and again, they found that those guys were gonna do violence towards him, so, uh, it really doesn't matter. 
[00:37:00]  You're going to fucking prison if you have a handgun in the city and don't have a license.  You're an expert on this stuff, Ant.  Jared has, uh, has kind of a, uh, a thought.  Jared in Boston?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Um, just to preface this, this guy fucking rules.  But, Anthony, back me up on this one.  Maybe, uh, if the cops don't get him on anything, uh, I see one potential problem.  I heard that you said two of the guys were shot in the back.  Yep.  I see some sort of a civil lawsuit, wrongful death. 
[00:37:30]  Definitely.  That's what they were fleeing the scene.  This guy's a fucking hero.  And some fucking scumbag family member, one of these douchebags, is going to bring something against him.  You're absolutely right.  I do believe this guy is going to be in civil court, if not criminal court.  But, uh, yeah, shooting the guys in the back, excessive force.  They were fleeing.  You're supposed to leave them alone.  Um, if they're leaving.  It was absolutely, it was absolutely warranted.  The guy, one of the guy's own employees was getting pistol whipped.  I mean, but you know what the guy, yeah, you know what the guy could say? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, they were, they were running out, but the, the one guy still had a gun and I, I, I could have sworn he was going to, he was turning or, or he, he stopped to, to turn and I shot him.  You know, there's, there's plenty of things this guy could say, but he'll never, I, I, me and Anthony discussed this too.  I saw the same thing in the back, but they're in his store.  No one's going to convict him, but he's going to be convicted of nothing.  Because again, what's to prevent those guys from running five more feet and then just both of them turning around and blasting at him again? 
[00:38:30]  It's like, those guys were armed.  They were in his store.  He absolutely is 100% right to shoot them dead.  I don't think a grand jury will indict him, but I think a civil suit is definitely in his future.  Would it be, would it be different if, uh, the guys made out of the store and were now running across the street and he blasted them?  Absolutely different.  Absolutely.  That would be a major difference, right?  Big problem for him if he does that.  Yeah, that could be.  You can't do that.  Right on.  All right, bud.  Thank you.  You could just say things, Kenny.  Here comes Ted.  Is it something called eminent domain?  Yes.  No. 
[00:39:00]  No.  Oh, you wrote eminent.  Kenny's an expert.  Let's go.  Eminent's front.  Kenny, what do you got?  Eminent danger?  It's called eminent danger.  What's it mean?  It means, like you said, at the time he might have been run away, but at any point, you know, he still could present a danger.  Now, once he left the store and was crossing the street, then you just can't blast at him.  Yeah, if they're legitimately fleeing and, you know, there's no threat.  He's in the right now.  You know, there's got to be, you know, the threat has to be present.  He won't get in any Dutch. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  I bet civil Dutch.  I bet that family's going to just, oh boy, ooh, he was a good boy.  He got in some trouble with drugs, but he was trying to get himself out of it.  That's every, by the way, that's every excuse in First 48 is he was really good and he was tied up in drugs, but he was trying real hard to get out of it for him and his baby.  He's like fucking 16.  Dude, no jury, though. 
[00:40:00]  No Harlem jury.  No jury is going to convict this guy.  A store owner defending a store.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy's defending his, if you can't do this in this society, just, you know, fucking cash it in.  We'll be watching this one closely.  Yeah.  We'll keep you posted.  Are you Google mapping the storefront?  Yeah, it's weird.  The address that they give in the story, it's just kind of like a scaffolding.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it might be a newer store from when these pictures were taken.  Maybe he moved because he's been in business a long time. 
[00:40:30]  Look up Stubb Salesman.  Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  What do you think of the Michael Vick thing?  I could care less.  I hate the Eagles.  Are you a football fan, though?  Yes, I am.  What's your team?  Actually, I like the Buccaneers.  All right, hold on a minute because let's get into this a little bit.  Yeah, me too.  My father-in-law is pretty much born and raised in Philly.  Well, he was, whatever, spent most of his life in Philly and he's a Dolphins fan. 
[00:41:00]  How does that work?  Like, probably many, many years ago when they were so good and undefeated, even though he's  older, but back then he might have jumped on the bandwagon.  Yeah.  And our old friend Joey Paisano couldn't be more.  He is the typical New Yorker and he's a huge Eagles fan.  Even though he's hardcore Yankees and he loves all the other New York sports teams, but he  doesn't like the New York football teams.  He's an Eagles fan.  How does that happen? 
[00:41:30]  It's weird.  That is weird.  Were you born in Philly, Charlie?  Oh, that's his own project.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, on the outskirts.  I live about an hour north.  So why did you decide you wanted to be a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan?  I, believe it or not, I was always a Raider fan growing up.  And when the Bucs started, when they picked up Warren Sapp, John Lynch, Michael Allstott,  I mean, I followed those guys in college.  I'm like, yeah, this team's going to be good someday.  And because I follow players more than teams.  Like right now, the Bucs are probably going to suck for the next 10 years. 
[00:42:00]  Just because of everything they're going through now.  I couldn't possibly enjoy this phone call less.  And it's nothing against you, sir.  I just don't care about the Buccaneers.  The Buccaneers.  Yeah, there's such a who-gives-a-shit team, Charlie.  I know.  Well, I know.  Can I ask Anthony a question, though?  Charlie.  Yeah, Charlie.  Anthony, I don't know about New York, but in Pennsylvania here, when you buy a shotgun,  it comes with a plug where you can only put three shells in it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, he got all four rounds? 
[00:42:30]  No, there's not a law against that in New York.  I know you got those plugs where you can only put fucking four shells in, or three shells in.  That's ridiculous.  Come on.  Load it up.  I pulled the plug out of mine.  Load it up.  Exactly.  All right, boys, have a good vacation.  And she was a stewardess.  Later.  We're big fans of the inside stuff on this show. 
[00:43:00]  There's a bunch of people out there going, what the fuck does that mean?  Well, you should listen a little longer.  What can I tell you?  The Google map of the location where that store is is right across the street from the projects, by the way.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It just looks like a nasty, nasty place.  You think that guy was scared?  Look.  You think that guy was scared to go to work every day?  Nope.  Not on Gus.  Nope.  Gus went to work every day just hoping.  Look, it was right across the street.  The Projects. 
[00:43:30]  Which one is that?  I don't know.  The put-in-some-famous oldie-time black-eye name here.  Something Houses.  Frederick.  Yeah, Something Houses.  You've got to see the Roberto Clemente projects.  The Roberto Clemente projects?  Holy shit.  That's the one.  That's the George Washington Carver peanut butter projects.  That could be the scariest one in the city.  Cabrini-Greens is a notoriously bad one if that still exists in Chicago.  Wow, Chicago. 
[00:44:00]  And the train runs right through the fucking projects.  What a shithole.  Oh, the L is right there.  But they've got opportunities to get out and make something of themselves right in.  Well, they do.  Everybody does.  It is a shitty situation.  Well, are you the house liberal, Francis?  There's a Q&A.  Yes.  House liberal.  Those people have it tough up there, sir.  Are you the house liberal, Francis?  Listen to this guy.  His father's friend.  Well, Mike, why don't you tell the story.  You're from PA, too? 
[00:44:30]  Already.  Yes, sir.  Are you an Eagles fan?  No.  No, I'm in Western PA.  I don't think I'm allowed to be.  All right, simmer down.  What, are you a Steelers fan?  I guess so, if I have to be.  What's wrong with you guys, man?  Football season.  I'm getting the feeling that this is going to be a really good football season.  Anyone else?  You kind of feel it, right?  No.  A lot of strong teams out there, and it doesn't follow football.  No.  I don't either.  No.  Drew Boogie in the corner, getting ready to play for us in a minute or so. 
[00:45:00]  All right, go ahead, Mikey.  He had a motorcycle shop here in Western Pennsylvania for a long time,  and it was repeatedly robbed, kind of out in the country there.  And so he went and put a fence over the windows like you guys have up there.  That's unusual in this area.  And they pulled the fence off all night and went in and stole some new motorcycles.  Dirt bikes, mostly.  And then one night, he had it all back together.  New window, new fence.  Sleeping behind the counter.  A couple guys come up, hooked onto the fence, pulled it off, smashed the window, came in. 
[00:45:30]  He shot one guy in the chest with a, I think it was a 410 or a 20 gauge.  But the guy landed outside.  There was no blood inside.  So they sued him.  He ended up losing the franchise and ultimately his livelihood.  I've heard those.  He smuck with a job.  I've heard those stories.  I don't know.  That's fucking amazing.  That doesn't make any sense.  Hi, buddy.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, Danny.  Could you, before we go to break, could you give old, what's his name again? 
[00:46:00]  Augusto?  Give a little Augusto something?  Sure.  Co-fucking-Cain!  That's a fucking lovely.  Gus Augusto gets the first co-fucking-Cain today.  Co-fucking-Cain.  You know what?  We never got the inspirational speech from Rocky.  Well, you do it, Andrew.  Daniel found it.  I want to see.  Well, we're all over the place.  You want to do it before the break? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, because I just want to see Jimmy get all douche-chilly.  Dude, it's fucking, right now he's standing there.  He has the, of course he does.  The American flag is draped around him.  And you know when Sly wrote this and read it in the fucking, in the read through, they  all went, wow, it's very inspirational, Sylvester.  Yeah.  Because nobody would say, hey, you fucking hairlip, blithering idiot.  That stinks.  It's trite.  And you're a bore.  Stop trying to be meaningful.  And now there's Russians behind him and the translator.  Remember, there's a translator there that has to translate everything Rocky's saying. 
[00:47:00]  And he's ready to give the inspirational speech.  He turned the crowd around.  And he's talking to fucking Sid, the sports guy.  Who the fuck that's?  He does look like Sid.  Creepy guy with the microphone.  Yeah, we can do it.  We change.  Shut up.  Rocky.  Rocky.  Let's listen to this, dude.  Garbage.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I came here tonight. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know what to expect.  Can you pause that?  Yeah, yeah.  I knew what to expect.  A douche chill moment.  And boy, did you deliver.  As he's talking, they're panning the crowd.  And you see military guys, you know, Russian army guys are standing there listening intently  to the words of Rocky.  Rocky.  It's like, we get it.  They're Russian.  They're trying to stress. 
[00:48:00]  They have, like, Russian lady hats on.  And shitty coats.  Babushkas.  Why don't you just all wear signs with a big R on them?  We get it.  We know where you are.  All right.  Okay.  I've seen a lot of people hating me.  And I didn't know what to feel about that, so I guess I didn't like you much, none, either.  That's it?  That's it?  Come on.  During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, whoa.  The way you felt about me and the way I felt about you.  In here, there are two guys showing each other, but I guess that's better than 20 million.  Pause that, please. 
[00:49:00]  Jimmy's head is in his hand.  He is disgusted.  Jimmy!  Look at the Politburo is up there watching, and now they're being inspired.  The entire Politburo.  Yes.  And I think that that woman over there, Drago's wife, I'm going to marry her.  Isn't that Brigitte Nelson?  Yeah.  Did he marry her?  I think he did.  He at least fucked the shit out of her.  Oh, this is fucking horrendous. 
[00:49:30]  And fake Gorby.  The guy that played Gorbachev in every fucking Russian.  They needed a Russian leader in the 80s movie.  Guy.  You know, he's just fucking, like, he's just right now going through scripts.  He probably downloads all scripts, and he puts the word Gorbachev, search, and if it's not in the script, he throws it out.  Just move on.  Yeah.  Spill some grape juice on his head, and then just...  He's ready to roll.  I'm trying to say, if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change. 
[00:50:00]  If I can change, you can change, everybody can change.  Yeah.  Very inspirational, Dumbbell.  Well, they're all clapping now.  The whole crowd is behind Rocky.  Over a fight? 
[00:50:30]  Well, it's more than just a fight.  We barely changed after 9-11.  Yeah, who gives a shit?  We barely changed after 9-11.  We're supposed to change after a fight?  The Rays are...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Look, look.  Gorby stands up.  Yuck!  Gorby stood up and did the slow clap.  The golf clap, but now he's really clapping.  And now, like, the head of the KGB stood up.  One thing to my kid, who should be home sleeping. 
[00:51:00]  Merry Christmas, kid!  You can see what you've done with the fuck.  Oh, no!  Happy New Year!  And now a great song by Sly's brother, Douchebag Stallone.  Yup.  All right, all right.  All right.  I cannot...  Are you embarrassed?  I am so fucking chill.  I got the chills of the Douche Variety.  I got goosebumps.  Bumps, and they're not from something good. 
[00:51:30]  A-boo!  A-boo.  A-boo!  The guy who looks like Orchard stood up and did the slow...  He did the slow clap.  They were all waiting.  It was like, does Mikey like it?  Kind of a moment.  He stood up, and there was a little bit of tension with the Russians.  Like, uh-oh, am I in trouble for clapping at Rocky?  And then he's like...  And they're all like, okay, it's okay to clap.  All right, our first break.  Rocky, the Russians, Rocky. 
[00:52:00]  Drew, where are you on this point?  He goes through a 20-minute fucking speech, and the Russian guy goes,  I have no idea.  What the fuck is that?  Goulash.  Those Russians don't fucking talk long, do they?  No, they're very to the point of Latin people.  Mafia.  Kill you.  They don't play games, the Russians.  No.  Mark, what are you doing?  What are you pointing at?  We got True Boogie in the studio.  Hold on a second there.  When we get back, we got some audio of Ant on Hannity. 
[00:52:30]  And I see there's a couple fucking Opie mentions.  I'm going to get into this a little bit.  Well, yeah, there were a couple of mentions.  You know, Hannity wants you on the show.  I'm going to fuck him up.  No qualms about that.  I'm going to bring Kenny with me, and I'm going to have him fucked up.  Aw, hell.  Also, other things.  Inspirational screeches.  We got, actually, we haven't fucked with Regis in a while.  He sounded like a complete dummy. 
[00:53:00]  He had Kate from Johnny Kate Plus 8 on.  Yeah.  And he did some just dumb stuff with her.  Uninformed stuff.  You would think if you're going to have Kate on, maybe you should know the show a little  bit.  Do a little research.  We'll explain.  And I know a lot of people are sick of this, but Bobo's new bit on the way.  Bobo's new bit.  And you got to give it to Bobo.  It's always something new.  Well, no, it has nothing to do with Bobo.  Of course not.  See, what you and I forget, and the listeners, we forget about Bobo. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  After he's in this studio, we forget about him.  Not Sam, not Danny, not Travis.  They're obsessed with him.  And they spend the whole week fucking with Bobo.  If I could change, and you could change, maybe we could all change, and not make fun  of me as much.  So, by the way, was it last week?  Yeah.  Bobo was here on Friday, but we were very busy.  Yeah.  And he didn't come in.  They made him sit in a box the entire time he was here. 
[00:54:00]  Well, that was after he actually got here.  We had called Bobo last Friday, probably about 5.15, to make sure he was coming.  Yeah.  And we told him to hurry up, because we wanted to use him for a bit ASAP, probably start  of the show.  So he goes, okay, I'll run there.  I'll get off the train and just run.  And then we never even had him on the show at all.  And not even didn't have him on the show.  So he kept him in a box, a giant box, the entire time.  I made a, actually, I made a four-minute video of that. 
[00:54:30]  Did you?  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  I'm glad you mentioned it.  Poor little bastard.  Bobo has become, like, the undercard for the OP and Anthony show.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not part of the broadcast anymore.  He's kind of like, he's kind of like, I don't know, they just fuck with him when we're...  It's a dark match, they call those.  What is it?  It's a dark match.  Oh, yeah, a dark match.  Thank you.  They don't make the television.  Yeah, no, not at all.  But with that said, these guys have been working with Bobo for the last week, even though you  and I and the rest of the audience forgot about Bobo.  Yeah.  And Bobo's new bid is on the way.  It is very funny. 
[00:55:00]  These guys are ruthless with this Bobo.  Terrible, terrible people.  All right.  Day before vacation, that means Drew Boogie's in the house.  Drew, you plugging anything?  What's your thing?  CD.  MySpace.com.  Flash the great Drew Boogie.  CD's still up there.  Nice.  Good.  I liked it.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.  I downloaded it from iTunes.  I've run through it a few times.  Very, very good stuff on there.  Ah, thank you.  So Drew Boogie's going to play us in and out of break today, the day before vacation.  So take it, Drew.  We'll be right back. 
[00:55:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:30]  Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co. 
[00:57:00]  Holy shit, I want to break stuff.  Drew Boogie doing that live in studio today.  How cool is that?  That is extreme.  That fucking is extreme.  The Opie and Anthony show day before vacation.  They're like yelling cocaine in there.  That's crazy.  We got Jay Oakerson stopping by.  We got Patrice O'Neill stopping by, I think, within 10, 15 minutes.  Nice.  We got Jeremy Piven calling about his new movie, The Goods. 
[00:57:30]  I think that opens today, right?  The Goods.  And that's not all on our phones right now is Mr. Bill Burr.  Bill!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hello, Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  What's up, Mr. Burr?  We fucking miss you, Bill Burr.  Hello, Anthony.  How are you, sweetheart?  Very good, love.  How you been?  Miss you.  Hey, Bill, are you doing a movie or something?  Yeah, I did that back in June.  I had One and a Half Lines in a major motion picture. 
[00:58:00]  That's good.  Major?  Which one?  Paging Mr. Herman.  Paging Mr. Herman.  You have a telephone call at the front desk.  I was in a movie called Date Night starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.  Jesus.  It comes out sometime in 2010.  Did you have, was your scene with either one of them?  Um, no.  Jesus.  Every question you ask, Jimmy, is a bad answer. 
[00:58:30]  It's a dig at Bill and his career.  But I wasn't actually.  I'm teasing.  I'm sort of like in the scene, but I never talk to either one of them.  But I just sort of poke my head in and go, hey, so-and-so, you got a phone call.  I swear to God.  And then I'm out.  Well, I mean, this is, you guys are starting to get in a lot of movies, a bunch of you guys.  But it's like a little scene here, a little scene there.  When are you going to get the big hit?  When is Bill Burr going to get the big hit?  When is Jim Norton going to get the big hit?  When is Patrice O'Neill going to get the big hit? 
[00:59:00]  How does that work?  I think, you know what?  I think I have to take an improv class.  Oh.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, no.  Bill, come on, Bill.  Those are the guys.  They're like, I don't know.  That's like, you really need that skill.  I had a big audition the other day, and I think I blew it because just being a comedian.  Oh, you got to come out of like the Groundlings or something?  I got to admit, yeah, those are the guys who booked that stuff.  But I don't know.  Zach Galifianakis has been doing good, so I don't know. 
[00:59:30]  But they're starting to pay attention to all you guys.  So it's probably just a matter of time before you get a major role in one of these things.  Yeah, I'm hoping to get, I don't know, just one of those one or two scene things.  And I don't know.  I'm going to always do stand-up.  So I just want to get in one of these.  So I have to do, you know, less radio when I'm on the road.  Yeah, you don't like doing that radio, huh?  I mean, I'm not talking about your show.  I'm talking about the other one.  I know.  Everyone says the same thing, which we appreciate. 
[01:00:00]  I want a blockbuster hit that I'm the star of and responsible for.  Wow.  That's going to happen eventually.  No.  Hey, Bill, what about Michael Vick?  You're a big sports fan.  Oh, my God.  I'm psyched he's coming back.  And I think people who are sitting there going, like, he doesn't seem like he's remorseful.  He doesn't have to be.  He did his time.  He got two years.  He did it.  You know, did it like a man.  Like, if you rob a bank and they give you eight years and you get out, there's nobody sitting there going, 
[01:00:30]  oh, he doesn't seem like he's remorseful that he robbed the bank.  I agree.  So I think he ought to be able to dropkick a beagle on the 50-yard line at this point.  The guy lost $100 million.  He went to Leavenworth, dude.  John Gotti went to Leavenworth.  He did this for dogs.  Somebody else killed somebody drinking and driving.  They got 30 days in jail.  He doesn't owe anything to anybody.  I don't think he should have gone to Philly, though.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just going to cause a quarterback controversy.  Oh, well, that's true. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  He should have gone to Detroit.  That would have appeased the animal lovers because it would have been like an extension to his sentence.  And then he also could have been like the hero, like try to, you know, turn that awful franchise around, you know?  I just don't see, like Philly, they already have Donovan McNabb.  I don't know.  Well, we mentioned when this was all starting to go down, we're like, it's obvious that Michael Vick will end up with an ugly, dirty type team.  Dirty team.  Like he's not going to go to the Colts or some of those nice, nice white bread type teams. 
[01:01:30]  You know what I mean?  We figured it.  I thought it was going to be the Raiders.  We said Raiders.  We said Detroit.  We said the Eagles.  There were a few others on the short list.  And sure enough, the Eagles grabbed the Cowboys, too.  It's like a team of criminals.  Right.  Yeah, that's actually a good call.  Maybe he should have played for the University of Miami.  Bill, how much money did he lose?  Like $100 million.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's got to hurt. 
[01:02:00]  That's got to hurt when you're really thinking about it.  An endorsement.  Of course, like I'm also, as always, repeating something I overheard in a bar.  But I know it was tens of millions of dollars this guy lost.  He lost his houses.  He lost, he's broke.  He lost two years of his career.  And he went to Leavenworth.  Wow.  What else does this guy have to fucking do?  You know what it is?  People are miserable with their own lives.  At this point, if you just, like, they just want to see him, they want to see a broken man. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  They want to see him on his knees and fucking, you know, fucking have a heartfelt moment with  a Cocker Spaniel.  I mean, I don't know what the fuck they want from this guy.  But, I mean, because obviously I don't condone what the guy did.  It was like bizarre.  But, I mean, shit, he did all his time.  He wasn't like Paris Hilton, who was there for a day and a half and fucking went home.  Started crying, and her mommy came and got her.  Has he actually, has anybody actually come out against it, though?  Or is it just that people are expecting it? 
[01:03:00]  PETA doesn't like him very much.  Yeah, PETA, yeah, PETA, when Obama slaughtered a fly.  Yeah.  This just hit, so I'm sure we'll hear from PETA and everyone else as the day goes on.  So, yeah, right on.  Yeah, they'll say we're disappointed, we're going to protest.  That's going to be, I want to see if the PETA people are going to have the balls to stand  outside, they don't play at Betton Stadium, whatever the fuck the Eagles play now.  Yeah, the new place.  All those maniac Philly fans.  Yeah.  That might be worth it, just to watch a couple of them get pounded. 
[01:03:30]  But because the guy went to jail, I wonder if people are going to have a problem with it.  It's really hard to argue with a guy who did time in prison and served a sentence.  I mean, it's like, that's what our whole country is.  It's like, once your time is served, you kind of get to start over.  Absolutely.  There will definitely be protests, though.  That's just how it is.  Yeah, no, that's kind of what I'm basing this on.  Like, I've been watching, you know, ESPN, and I've listened to a little bit of radio,  and there's people still complaining.  And their argument is, he hasn't said anything. 
[01:04:00]  He doesn't sound remorseful.  Dude, people fucking love dogs.  They love them more than they love people.  That's what we say.  Yeah, we were just saying that.  It's like, people just freak out when, in a movie, a dog gets hurt.  People are like, oh, but it could be just a huge body count, and no one gives a shit.  Like, people love treating dogs like they're part of the family.  We're a crazy nation.  Yeah, but he was a piece of shit with them.  Even though I think he should be able to play, and he should be left alone, 
[01:04:30]  he was a complete piece of shit.  It wasn't like he just hit a dog because he was being careless.  He was a fucking complete vulture.  Absolutely.  But there was a guy, one of those guys, a guy in the Browns, he was driving drunk, and he killed somebody.  The guy did 30 days.  Yeah.  He killed, you know, a bunch of dogs, and he did two years in Leavenworth and lost, you know,  evidently $100 million, according to the coke head.  Two bar schools down to me.  And now because of that, we're going to quote that all day long. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  And we got our info from Bill, who got it from some coke head at a bar.  At a bar.  There you go.  But that's how it works.  That's how we all work.  Who are you kidding?  Hey, Bill, you're doing the New York Comedy Festival.  That's huge.  Yeah, I'm calling up to whore myself out, and we're performing at Town Hall on November 6th,  and the tickets go on sale today.  I'm kind of gearing up for another special, and that Town Hall date will probably be about 
[01:05:30]  three weeks away from me taping my special.  So if you can't make it to my special, go to that show, because that will essentially be the special.  Who are you working with?  Do you know?  I am working with young Joe DeRosa.  Oh.  Teen Idol of the Opie and Anthony show.  Teen Idol.  We love Joe.  You've got to move back to New York, Bill, because, you know, he's taking your spot.  Dude, I've got to tell you, if I can, like you were saying, when are you going to get  that breakout role?  If I can get some shit where I can actually, I wasn't getting any auditions for stuff like 
[01:06:00]  this in New York.  Some guys do, but it just, it wasn't happening for me.  Yeah.  So that's the reason why I went out there, you know?  Yeah, of course.  16 years into doing stand-up, and I'd go meet a casting director out there, and they'd  just be like, so you do comedy?  I know what I'm doing.  I was like, yeah, fuck, I've got to climb up this one now.  So, I don't know.  Hey, Bill, I've got your plug sheet in front of me.  I don't want to confuse everyone, but what I've got is that the tickets go on sale August  17th, which would be... 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.  I was just trying to make sure you guys were paying attention.  I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  Are you right, or are we right?  Oh, you're right.  You're right.  Okay, because, you know, people are going to start calling on what the fuck.  They're going to get confused, and then they're going to give up.  Tickets go on sale for Bill Burr's town hall date, Friday, November 6th, here in New  York City, Monday, Ticketmaster.com, NewYorkComedyFestival.com as well.  These tickets will sell real fast.  Hey, I was at the Helium Comedy Club in Philly over the weekend, and they got one of your  T-shirts in the case there. 
[01:07:00]  I was laughing my ass off.  Bill Burr has a T-shirt where...  Explain it, Bill.  It's when you took on Philly, and I believe it's the Liberty Bell, and then it's a lot of  the stuff that Bill said on the back of the shirt.  As I was saying this, I'm hoping it's not Bill's shirt.  I hope they stole it.  I only sold those in Philly.  When I came back there, I had one of those.  It was basically...  I should get into this shit.  I was kind of going back and forth with... 
[01:07:30]  I was just dealing with some bullshit with selling my CD, and I just didn't want to sell  it anymore, and I just said to hell with it.  So I just did like a one-off sort of T-shirt the last time I went through there, and I  don't have any left.  Who was giving you shit about your CD?  Was it the people who made it?  Yeah, I kind of got into one of those behind-the-music contracts.  Oh, shit.  And then I realized that it wasn't great.  So then I was like, I know what I'm going to do.  I'm not going to sell my CD.  I'm going to sell a T-shirt instead. 
[01:08:00]  So I went down there with all these T-shirts, and I sold like eight of them.  And I felt like a jackass, and then I had a TVG.  Well, the reason...  That was a low moment.  The reason I bring it up, the people I were with, they all want one.  So I'm assuming that if you threw it up on your website, a bunch of people would get  it, especially the people that saw you just rip apart the crowd in Philly a couple summers  ago.  Well, you know, maybe I'll...  I've always had a problem selling something that wasn't... 
[01:08:30]  that didn't have, like, material on it.  You know, I might as well be selling, like, refrigerator magnets and shit like that.  So I kind of just did it in a moment of being pissed about the CD thing.  And then I was standing there selling CDs, and I felt like more of a whore than I usually  do after a show when I peddle my wares, as they say.  Hawk your goods.  Do you realize that was three years ago, that Philly show?  No.  That was 2006.  Get the fuck out of here.  Three summers ago already?  Yep.  September.  Holy shit. 
[01:09:00]  Well, it's fucked up.  All right, Bill.  November 6th, Town Hall is part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Tickets go on sale Monday, Ticketmaster.com.  Okay.  Beautiful.  Thank you for liking my gigs.  Always nice to talk to you guys.  And hopefully, I will be back on the East Coast soon, and I will be in there running my mouth.  Yes.  See you soon, love.  Miss you, Bill.  Miss you guys.  Take it easy, man.  It's the awkward ending to the phone call.  Now what?  And it's funny, because Bill made a good point about tickets going on sale and stuff. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, this is not about my tickets.  No?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fuck that.  I don't care.  Whatever you're doing today, ignore noon.  Who gives a shit?  Long Island tickets for Jim Norton?  Not important.  Who cares?  It's not even about that.  Don't even waste your breath, October 2nd, in Bayshore, today at noon.  Why would you even care that they go on sale today at noon?  Dude, people are like, why don't they sell them earlier?  And I'm like, why don't you call 866-811-3111 and yell? 
[01:10:00]  No one's going to be there yet.  No, not now.  Start yelling at noon.  At noon, yeah.  Yell.  Buy tickets first, then yell.  Do it or don't do it.  It's up to you.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice.  Good morning.  I have a feeling you might have something to say about the Michael Vick thing.  Because I remember when this whole thing went down.  Can I?  You were like, you guys don't understand the culture of what goes on.  I love dogs.  Love them more than people, as Bill was saying.  I love dogs.  I knew you'd have something to say. 
[01:10:30]  Go ahead.  I couldn't stand what he did.  People who are vicious to animals bug me.  Especially if you're up at 4 o'clock in the morning watching Isle of Lucy.  And Sarah McLaughlin comes on.  Oh, I will remember you.  Showing a picture of a kitten with conjunctivitis.  And a fucking puppy smoking a cigarette with a fucking headache bag on.  If you don't feel bad for animals after you're watching a fucking watery-eyed kitten. 
[01:11:00]  Dude, that is the fucking worst commercial.  And it's in between fucking Carol Burnett, fucking Guthy Rankin selling Carol Burnett, and a Lucifer.  And it's so long, the commercial too.  And a fucking pit bull puppy missing a paw.  Now, snorting cocaine, he has no home.  Now, if you don't fucking feel for an animal after you watch that, you're a fucking serial killer. 
[01:11:30]  There's a one-eyed cat.  You're a hunk of shit.  If a kitten with a fucking, with pink eye doesn't fuck you up, you're a cocksucker.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Turn the shit off, man.  I don't want to see that shit.  I don't want to see that, man.  We're watching the commercial.  Look at the dog with the paralyzed back legs.  Oh, fucking no.  Oh, look at that.  What a bad boy he's been. 
[01:12:00]  That dog looks so sad.  Look, it misbehaves.  Dude, I can't even look at that commercial.  It ruins me.  I'm Sarah McLachlan.  Yes, bitch.  I spread peanut butter on my pussy.  Let the dog lick it off.  All she sings is sad songs.  I know.  And it gets sadder and sadder, bitch.  Kill yourself.  Throw a Frigbee to that fucking thing.  These poor animals, man.  That looks like a healthy dog.  Exactly.  The whole thing's about money. 
[01:12:30]  Look at the poor little kittens.  It ain't about money.  A kitten.  Kittens with a headache is the worst thing ever.  A headache bag.  A fucking headache bag.  I love that old school cartoon headache bag and a cigarette and fucking deep thoughts and shit.  I don't need it.  Goddamn, Patrice.  I fucking...  I love animals.  It's a three-legged cat.  Oh, Jesus.  Three-legged cat.  What's wrong with that dog? 
[01:13:00]  That dog looks normal.  I don't know.  Look at more...  I don't...  What's wrong with these animals?  They mostly look okay.  And how long is this fucking infomercial?  Forever this goddamn thing takes so long.  Yeah, but you don't know what these animals did to bother the owners.  They don't share the whole picture.  I refuse to look at it any longer, man.  The guy's fucking scrubbing his pots and pans with a kitten's eye.  Yeah, exactly.  Who are these people who hate animals, man?  Oh, no.  I love animals, but I will punch a kitten squarely in the middle of its face.  If it mews while I'm watching TV, I will punch it squarely in its face. 
[01:13:30]  If it mews...  Fucking assholes, man.  Danny brought that shit right up.  Of course he did.  I don't like Michael Vick for what he did.  Yeah.  The unfortunate thing is the race thing, too.  You gotta always...  Like, if it was Brett Favre, it'd be easier for me to just say fucking kill him or whatever.  Yeah.  But me and a friend of mine was talking about Michael Vick, and this stands for anybody in trouble.  Jail is so you don't have to be sorry. 
[01:14:00]  He's not sorry.  Wow.  He drowns dogs in buckets and has been doing it for years.  He got out of jail.  That was the time he had to pay for what he did, was what he did.  He shouldn't have to...  He should come out and go, man, if I get my hands on another motherfucking dog, I'm gonna drown his motherfucking ass in milk.  Because milk is...  I'm gonna fucking shoot him in his face.  He doesn't need to...  Because he's not sorry, but he paid whatever the price of... 
[01:14:30]  Gary Ridgeway, the fucking Green River Killer, killed 50 hookers, 70 hookers.  He got the rest of his life in jail.  That's the non-apology time.  Jail is so you don't apologize.  If I was able to apologize, don't send me to fucking jail.  I stabbed this guy.  He died.  I'm so fucking sorry.  I didn't want him to die.  I'm sorry.  You don't need to send me to jail.  I'm contrite, and I apologize now.  I like that point.  Don't fucking send me to jail if you need me to be sorry afterwards. 
[01:15:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Stop with the...  He has to be apologetic.  This fucking guy...  What's his name?  He's lost his guy.  He's gonna lose.  He can't drive.  I think that's almost worse than doing time in prison.  Whoa, Dante?  Dante Stormer can't drive forever.  He doesn't...  Well, how long do they...  Forever!  Forever.  No.  Yes!  That's right.  He's got enough money.  He can actually hire someone to drive him.  But not...  No.  You know how much...  No.  You know how much that's a hassle after a while? 
[01:15:30]  Well, of course it is, but it beats going to prison for tenure.  It might be cool at first, like, oh, cool, I got a driver, but...  And he's a fucking football player.  Football players aren't like basketball players.  Wait, wait, wait.  Patrice, is that real, though?  He's gonna...  For the rest of his life, he can't drive.  Oh, his 30s are lost.  Suspended, lifetime suspended driver's license.  He's probably in one state, though.  In one state.  And he doesn't play this season.  No, there's no more one states anymore.  When your license is suspended in one place, the only reason it was like that before  is because computers didn't exist.  Yeah.  When your shit's suspended, it doesn't mean you can fucking drive in Massachusetts and 
[01:16:00]  not drive in Kentucky.  That's true.  Because he's a rat.  It's a rat.  How come he only got 30 days in jail then?  That was the deal, because he's Dante Starworth, and he made a deal with the family.  The family got bought off, so he hit somebody, whatever that could be.  Jesus.  So he had to give the family an undisclosed amount, which is seven figures, of course.  And never drive again.  Never drive again.  He's on fucking probation for years.  I don't know exactly how many years he's on probation.  And then he gets suspended a year in the NFL.  Next year, he should be able to just wear, you know, his sweatsuit should have Ciroc on 
[01:16:30]  it, Belvedere, or tequila.  He should have anything he fucking wants, because he's paying the price for sorry.  This is what you pay when you, so you don't have this, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  In lieu of him, I'm sorry.  In lieu of him, I'm sorry.  His life is over.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, in corporate America, they don't hire people that are, you know, felons and  whatnot, but in the NFL, eh, they invite you right back. 
[01:17:00]  Isn't it?  But it's God, he can catch.  Huh?  No, I know.  You think the players on the opposing team are going to give him some big hits?  No.  They're used to guys who do fucked up things in the NFL.  You don't think?  You don't think there's guys that are, like, animal lovers, and there's Michael Vick,  and then they're like, you know what, I'm going to hit this guy a little.  It'll end up being very racial, but I don't like how the news portrays niggas as, like,  we hate dogs, man.  I hate that they portray, every time they interview, hey, what you think of Michael? 
[01:17:30]  Man, it's a motherfucking dog, nigga.  Drown that, nigga.  Motherfucker with a puppy head sandwich, like, ow.  Nigga, man, fuck that shit.  And then they show what's going to be, here's some more stuff he's going to do, 50,000 white  women every football game with dead baby seal faces.  Right, right, right.  They're going to buy lump tickets and just annoy the fucker for the rest of his life.  Absolutely.  He paid the fucking price, even though I hate the fact that he, he had enough money to get 
[01:18:00]  a euthanasia machine.  Like, he had enough money to buy one of those things that put animals to sleep peacefully.  That's fucked up.  As opposed to sleep.  Look it.  Why didn't he pick another hobby?  He, he slammed them on the ground.  Right.  Pick him up by their, by their chest and slam him on the ground, drown him in buckets, shoot  him.  Those, that motherfucker was sadistic.  He's a complete piece of shit. 
[01:18:30]  I don't, I do not condone what the fuck, but, but if you wanted to put him in jail for  20 years, that's the, the loo of apology time.  Of apology.  They gave him the apology time, which was two fucking years.  We, we have the Stallworth, uh, sentence here, served 24 days in a Miami Dade jail as part  of a plea agreement, which includes, here it is, two years of community control, and  that's Florida's version of house arrest, eight years of probation, drug and alcohol 
[01:19:00]  testing.  So that's eight years.  You can't even have a fucking drink.  One thousand hours of community service.  How many years is that?  What is a thousand hours?  How many years?  How many years?  How many years?  That is a thousand hours of on the side of the road, picking up garbage, or feeding homeless  people.  It's a hundred, it's a hundred ten hour days.  Changing old people's diapers.  A hundred ten hour days.  Holy shit.  And, uh, a lifetime suspension of his driver's license. 
[01:19:30]  Jesus.  Stallworth also reached a multi-million dollar financial settlement with, uh, Reyes' family.  That means he wants to play again.  Oh, wow.  And that is, you put that in a scale, and then you put I'm sorry on the other side,  and it all equals out.  That's it.  I'm sorry or that.  I mean, I'm fucking sorry.  That's it.  I did not.  Listen.  I drank.  I did.  I drank too much.  I shouldn't have did that.  I did not want to kill a man. 
[01:20:00]  I will pay his family.  I don't want to put a price on this man's life, but I'll pay his family for what he would  have brought to the table, and I'm fucking going to live with this for the rest of my  life.  Uh, please don't do this.  Yeah.  I will not drink again.  He's not going to drink again any fucking way.  You don't think so?  Hell no.  It's liquor.  For eight years, he can't.  He's got drug and alcohol.  But for eight years, he has to report to you, Anthony.  How are you doing?  Hey, Dante.  What's going on, buddy?  Just looking in your face, angry, because there's going to be a white guy that goes, 
[01:20:30]  you just pissed away all your Negro future.  You people.  Just some asshole who's working hard, some dog to body on a piece of garbage who just  goes, you people.  You fucking people.  You dirty motherfuckers.  My nephews are a Polish soccer hooligan, and here you are, because you can catch a ball.  You dreaded up Negro.  You dreaded up Coon, and you fucking pissed it away. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to make your life miserable.  You're not going to get any special treatment here, stupid.  And how are you going to get home after you leave here?  Yeah.  What are you going to hit you?  You're going to walk, bitch?  Grab a cab.  That's a nightmare.  The one that makes me want to go to jail, because sometimes you go, I can get out of  jail early.  You can do a three-year bid, or you can do a one-year bid with two-year probation.  Yeah.  I might want to do the whole three, because then you're free from the confines of the  state.  This guy, I might want to do some time just so I can drive again. 
[01:21:30]  Right, right, right.  But not driving again is just, I've never heard of anybody that can't drive ever again  in their whole life.  He's got to, like, move to Spain or something and get a license there.  How do you...  Like, somewhere else in the world.  He's got to move to Canada or Mexico.  That's a lot of time and not driving.  Did he have other drunk driving or convictions?  No.  I guarantee this is not his first one.  No.  No.  Because he killed a guy.  He killed a guy.  That's big.  Yeah, it's usually a 10-year... 
[01:22:00]  That's big.  That's a big one.  I mean, he got out of jail.  That motherfucker is a piece of shit.  I can't disagree, man.  He is a piece of fucking shit.  Why did he have to do that?  Why not?  Knowing he had so much to lose if he got caught.  Fuck him, man.  Smashing dogs and drowning dogs in buckets.  And again, this is...  Well, it's not allegedly because he admitted it to him.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he did.  But the government put a pistol to your mouth and go, look it, man.  Because the government got a 98% conviction rate.  Yeah.  And if he fought the government, he fought the law and the law won, that motherfucker could 
[01:22:30]  have been doing.  Big, big years.  So it's possible that he could have just said, yeah, I did that.  But he might not have been drowning dogs and shooting them.  But he admitted to it.  So I guess it's that he did it.  That's what bothers me.  If there's like, oh, we found a machine that puts dogs to sleep and they just...  The losers are all bitten up, so we got to put them to sleep.  But he slams dogs on the ground.  How the fuck can you do that to an animal, dude?  He's a piece of shit. 
[01:23:00]  And look at its little fucking chewed up face.  Suffering that.  I've been cursed with giving a shit about animals.  It's a curse.  It's not like...  I wish I could just step right over a baby seal getting clubbed and go, hey, hey, hey.  You should have took a left when you took a right there, buddy.  Jimmy, now that you know more...  You think you should be playing again?  I still think that once you've done your jail...  Yes, because once you've done your jail time, they can't stop you from earning.  I just hope that his fucking life is miserable.  It's not up to anyone's opinion now whether this guy should fucking be able to work or not. 
[01:23:30]  I agree with you.  You could hate him.  You could despise what he did.  You could never fucking watch a game that he ever fucking plays in.  Whatever.  But he did his fucking time.  I agree.  So now he can fucking do whatever he needs to do.  I predict right now that he takes some horrendous hits.  I'm telling you.  There's going to be someone out there that is going to be like, they're going to see him  and they're going to go, you know what?  I can't hold back.  This motherfucker needs to get hit hard.  Every NFL player will almost defend the fact that he fucked up. 
[01:24:00]  He paid the price.  I'm telling you.  Oh, yeah.  Because most NFL players are dudes like that.  I'm with you.  A majority of the people.  There's going to be a few.  There's going to be a few out there that are going to be like, you know what?  I can't let...  There are a few guys that are probably going to want to hurt him for that.  And try to be a hero for the...  That's a very visceral reaction.  Oh, no, they're going to try to make it look clean.  They're not going to, like, risk their own careers.  But I'm telling you, there's going to be...  I just have a feeling there's a few guys out there that have that anger right now.  There probably are, but I think for the most part, you're going to get it there before  the grace of God go I kind of.  I best not fuck with him because I could be the next guy. 
[01:24:30]  It's like us fucking shitting on radio guys when they get fired.  Now, he's sadistic.  No, they're going to be careful about it.  I mean, when you line up against your opponent and he's a nice guy, you're hitting pretty dead  hard.  Yeah, there's somebody that's going to want to hurt him for that.  I just have a feeling that it's not going to end, you know, pretty for Michael Vick  this season.  Because some of those NFL guys are out of the way.  And he's going to Philly?  Yeah.  Well, we said it had to be a dirty team.  Yeah.  We said it.  With filthy fans.  We said there was a short list of teams that he could play for.  With nasty fans.  Do you know how many sad dog pictures are going to be in every Eagle's game? 
[01:25:00]  I didn't know it.  Sad?  Philly?  Dead dogs.  They're going to swing around dead dogs and put those little things that go...  The party favors.  Little puppies on a fucking...  Blow into a puppy tail.  His tongue flies out, uncurls, and makes a whistle.  Are you fucking serious, man? 
[01:25:30]  Do the Eagles play the Browns this year?  With the dog pound?  I just got to see how that works out.  Oh, with the bloody dog.  It's going to be...  Michael Vick is going to fucking get it.  Usually?  They don't need to because they're in the AFC, but they might.  They might.  Right.  This is an outside chance.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, the fans.  The fucking Philly fans.  But if he gets in the game and takes over that asshole Donovan McNabb, who makes me more sick,  and I know you guys don't follow football like that, but there's nothing more that I hate in the game 
[01:26:00]  than a black quarterback who won't run because he's trying to be smart like a white guy.  So if they put Donovan on his fucking ass because he's trying to go...  Because he busted his knee years ago, and that was his big dream.  So now he can't run so he can prove to everybody, I'm smart like Peyton Manning.  But if Peyton Manning and Tom Brady could run, they'll be like,  These white guys, the weapons.  The ultimate...  He's a weapon of mass destruction, Tom Brady. 
[01:26:30]  As soon as he sees daylight, he's running.  And everybody else, look at this dumb nigga.  Can't throw.  He just runs.  I fucking hate black quarterbacks who won't run.  Yeah.  If he gets hit and Michael Vick comes in that motherfucker and takes the Eagles to the Super Bowl...  How does that work?  If I was a puppy, I would never go to Philly because they'll just be killing dogs.  Because Michael Vick don't like them.  Dude, all right.  It'll be a drowning dog celebration.  In the end zone, they'll hold up puppies. 
[01:27:00]  Touchdown, Michael Vick!  How about this scenario?  Spike a fucking Shih Tzu.  Or instead of Gatorade, they'll just pour a thing of dead, wet dog on him.  If that fucker does well, we'll forget all about his fucking murder.  Let's follow that scenario.  Michael Vick is now the quarterback of the Eagles and they're in the Super Bowl, which  is the biggest corporate fucking event in the world.  How does that work out?  Oh, man.  Dave.  How does that work out?  He just doesn't... 
[01:27:30]  He just doesn't...  Michael Vick, he just won the Super Bowl.  Where are you going?  Oh, nigga.  But you're winning some dogs I can kill.  Doggy land, nigga.  I can drown some puppies.  But you think Budweiser would be all in?  Absolutely.  They'd be all in.  They just wouldn't be in.  Super Bowl, Michael Vick is the quarterback.  Absolutely.  Budweiser's still all in.  And they would go, here's what Budweiser would do.  Really?  They would go, hey, look, you know, he paid his...  They would say what everybody should be saying.  He paid his debt to society.  He's very contrite. 
[01:28:00]  He's sorry Roger Goodell made the right.  Boom.  And Michael Vick will say, I really appreciate it.  And he'll have a fucking Budweiser and drink it.  But beer's a little bit more like...  They're not Procter & Gamble.  Beer's a little more like testy.  They'll do some testy shit like that.  Yeah, you got like fucking tampon commercials during...  Because he might even do a commercial where dogs are attacking him in some weird way or  whatever.  You're right.  Well, like...  Oh, shit.  No.  What do you mean?  No way.  You can never get away from having that.  No.  I got a juicy commercial. 
[01:28:30]  Jesus.  And you just want us to listen to your thoughts.  He might do a commercial.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, you're right, Patrice.  Hey, look, I'm not one of you stopped from making a dumb point.  It was dumb as soon as you go, what the fuck?  And as soon as I thought about it, like, hey, this is Michael Vick.  And some fucking big schnauzer's licking him in the face.  And he goes, I'm sorry.  And he drinks a Budweiser.  Yeah, that'll happen.  That'll happen.  They bring Spuds McKenzie back just so he can shove his head in a bucket of beer. 
[01:29:00]  He draws dogs in buckets of beer.  Hey, if you're going to draw...  Hey, which one of these beers is this animal?  Does he like Coors Light?  Or the...  Or Schlitz?  Spuds McKenzie was Bud, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so, all right, so if he gets a sponsorship with another beer company, yeah, why not?  Just drown Spuds McKenzie.  Fuck him.  Here's a Heineken or whatever the fuck.  Oh, oh.  Those sons of bitches, man.  Wow.  I mean, that motherfucker, all he's going to be able to make for the rest of his life...  He's like Kramer.  Kramer's finished.  Done. 
[01:29:30]  For the rest of his life.  Michael Vick is finished.  At least Michael Vick has still got football he can play.  But if it's like, oh, come on, put him on TV, and they ain't going to fuck with him.  Nah, this is going to be fun to watch.  Well, he's...  It's going to be...  Well, I should say interesting to watch.  It's going to be...  You're finished.  You're finished in the world.  That's all he was looking for.  Once you...  I'm telling you.  Once you invade how visceral shit to white people, especially white women, like the nigger  shit made white people look embarrassed and embarrassed white people with fucking Kramer. 
[01:30:00]  Career over.  If you notice, Michael Jackson's career was good up until white people didn't like him  when he held that fucking kid over the balcony.  Over the balcony.  When he held that little white baby over the balcony, and white women said, this son of  a bitch.  Little blanket.  It was a rap.  And he's fucking...  He is fucking...  Michael Vick pissed off dog lovers.  And I'm going to tell you, I love dogs, but I was at the Short Hills Mall, and I'm going  to tell you how much white bitches love dogs.  It's funky bitch. 
[01:30:30]  I wish I had got her name, because I say her name.  She talked to my dog, because I brought my puppy to the Short Hills Mall hanging around.  Yeah.  She talked to my fucking dog through me.  And what's your name?  And it's almost like she points, action, nigga.  Oh, Gladys.  Holy shit.  And how old are you?  Come on, nigga.  You can't talk.  One.  Good doggy.  One.  Look at this dog.  Talking to my fucking dog, and not me, that cunt. 
[01:31:00]  What kind of dog you got?  A little poodle.  Aw.  It is a cute dog.  That's adorable.  I'm just surprised.  I wouldn't think you would have a poodle.  What did you think?  It's for my...  I don't know if I would have said pit bull, but I would have said poodle.  Pit bulls scare me to death, man.  They're frightening, right?  They just don't look like lovable dogs.  They look like they'll kill you.  Big Tyrannosaurus jaw on them and shit.  Like a fucking shark.  A walking shark.  It's going to look like that.  A walking shark.  Like a big shark's head. 
[01:31:30]  And them devil eyes.  But at the same time, my buddy, who's a pit bull guy, pit bulls are loyal.  They love...  I'm a mutt fan.  I got my girl wanted a dog where she can be like a white woman walking up the street.  And a kid, you know, it's one of those little toy dogs.  But that woman, you know, that woman...  I was only there because my dog couldn't talk.  She didn't even really go...  She didn't have any bonding with me.  Fucking interpreter.  I was interpreting for the dog. 
[01:32:00]  And what kind of dog is it?  Come on, speak up, nigga!  Quickly!  I have no time to read its mind!  Oh, shit.  Bitch.  So he pissed them off.  I'm sorry, man.  He pissed that unforgiving fucking genre off, which is fucking white women that love animals,  dude.  But the difference is, though, he doesn't rely on them for his living, though.  That's the only thing he has going for them is he doesn't rely on them.  He relies on guys. 
[01:32:30]  Hold on.  We always got to pause to just look.  Brooklyn, get the fuck out of the way.  There we go.  Don't look at that.  She stops the show in his tracks every morning.  She works on the morning mashup, Nicole.  Sirius Channel 1, I think.  All right.  That's my take on Vic, my friend.  That is a great take.  And we should replay that all week long while we're out of here.  How about we just replay it the rest of the day and just go home now?  No, shit.  Well, we've got to get into the Hannity stuff. 
[01:33:00]  It was on Hannity last night.  We're going to do that after the break.  We've got Bobo's new bit.  Bobo's new bit.  And a lot of people beating up Super Agent Bob Eatman.  I'll explain after the break.  Oh, really?  It's really funny, actually.  Oh, good.  I've got to check that out.  Look at all these comments.  Pages and pages.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  My videos get a little attention.  You put Super Agent Bob Eatman in a video and you get this.  Look at this.  Page after page of abuse.  Nosferatu comments.  I'm going to read some of the better ones after the break.  Hey, did that corpse leave town yet or is he still here? 
[01:33:30]  Back to Transylvania in a box full of dirt.  It's the fucking worst.  They said that we described him perfectly over the years.  They finally get to see what he looks like.  Hey, Patrice, you figure out your plug?  I remember earlier in the week you were all messed up.  So next week?  August 21st to the 23rd in Cleveland Improv.  Cleveland Improv.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  I'm glad I came here because I would have been waiting at the airport to go to Cleveland.  We saved your flight, right?  Fucking God bless you.  Yeah, that would have been fucked up.  Cleveland, wake up and go see Patrice O'Neal.  I'm glad Steve gave a shit before I did about the damn date. 
[01:34:00]  You do well in Cleveland?  I've never been to Cleveland.  Holy shit.  You have to really?  They're going to love you in Cleveland.  This is my first time in Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  Other than the virus.  Yeah, they'll love you.  Yeah, they're going to love you.  That's a great town for Patrice O'Neal for next weekend.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, and Jim Norton.  Oh, Drew Boogie.  Hold on.  Drew, hit it.  We'll be in the table.  Oh, yes.  It's a demo. 
[01:34:30]  It's a demo.  It's a demo.  It's a demo.  It's a demo.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes, yes.  No.  Oh, the demo.  No.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, it's Drew Boogie.  Oh, I got it.  It's a demo.  Yeah.  Oh, I got it.  It's a demo.  What don't you f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f 
[01:35:30]  Drew Boogie, doing that live for us today, day before vacation.  Yeah.  We'll be back, I don't know, end of the month.  Taking two weeks this summer.  That's nice.  I like that.  When are we back?  I don't know.  What?  31st.  31st?  All right, so we can do one more day of radio this month. 
[01:36:00]  When is Labor Day weekend?  The week after, so then we get a nice long weekend.  Goddamn, yo!  We set this one up nice, yo!  Patrice O'Neal helping us out today.  And I got to say, yesterday after the show, we all went to breakfast.  Is that a screen cap from your video camera?  That's fucking really clear.  My HD flip.  I should work for HD flip because I've sold a lot of motherfucking cameras for this company.  The flip is an amazing little fucking gaz.  It's amazing.  And it picks up the audio pretty good. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah!  Every once in a while you're a little frustrated you're not close enough to the audio source.  They figured it out.  I was talking last night with some guy, we were talking about old camcorders  and how you used to see people like at Disney with those giant fucking camcorders on their shoulder  and how inconvenient it was.  They'd be on rides and have to hold the fucking thing in their lap or something  or leave it somewhere because you couldn't take it on a ride with it.  And now every little thing has a fucking video camera in it.  A pencil.  And you know the HD flip. 
[01:37:00]  I have a feel on the next one, the next generation, where you're going to be able to upload right  from the motherfucker.  How great would that be?  You'd be wireless to the net?  I have a feel on that.  You'd be wireless to be the way.  Without a doubt.  That's the way it's going.  I don't know if you've got your groomsmen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it HD or is it a regular?  How do you remember that?  I remember things.  Oh, nice.  I remember things.  That's for remembering my special occasion.  He didn't remember.  I told him.  He asked me, what did I get for his groomsmen?  I told him the fucking thing.  I gave him all an HD flip.  Farty fucker.  Oh, you made me sick. 
[01:37:30]  So listen.  All right.  So after the show yesterday, I made a video of our little breakfast.  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  But I feel so bad for Super Agent Bob Eatman because I was excited to go, well, I should  show everybody Bob Eatman.  We've been beating him up for years.  And I usually get maybe 20, 30 comments per video, maybe.  This one's well over 100, and it's not stopping anytime soon.  They are beating the shit out of Super Agent Bob Eatman in this video.  Poor Bob.  And he's on film for maybe five seconds. 
[01:38:00]  And the video's like five minutes long, I think.  What you should feel worse about is the fucking fat-faced, kind of like ass-cheek-necked idiot  poking his fucking Casper head in.  Oh, shit.  I thought this video was about a buzzard swooping in to kill Bob Eatman.  I'm sorry about that.  That's you, Norm, you fucker.  The blubbery-necked apparition.  Just a few of the comments.  Oh, my God.  Even Super Agent Bob Eatman looks like he's doom and gloom.  Look how pale and undead he looks.  Bobby is cute, though. 
[01:38:30]  That ghoul fucking Eatman.  And I bet Bob didn't pay either.  It just goes on and on.  Holy shit.  Maybe Ann can help me out with this one.  Eatman is G-Man from Half-Life.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Holy shit.  He really is.  Or a retarded Gregory Peck.  AG1247 writes, wow, you guys don't lie when you say he's a ghoul.  Coke Logic, I'm shocked to see Bob Eatman doesn't burst into flames in the sunlight.  Mr. Kenji writes, Michael Jackson has been dead for a month and a half, 
[01:39:00]  and he still looks better and has more color than Super Agent Bob Eatman.  How about Bob Dole?  He looks like Dole's arm.  Beta 2G.  No wonder Bob Eatman has never been on camera.  This guy writes, Eatman looks like the vampire from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Eatman looks like he came from dark shadows.  Fancy people eating all by themselves.  Super Agent Bob Eatman looks like he's holding kryptonite. 
[01:39:30]  He's the walking dead.  It just goes on and on and on.  He needs follicles.  What happened to Eatman's upper lip?  Looks like a burn victim.  That's Wrath Child 11.  He's just being horrible for the man.  Someone should tell Eatman that it's too early to have on his Boris Karloff makeup.  I don't know.  Is there any audio of him talking?  He said, like, hi to the camera.  How the fuck can you eat with that zombie Bob Eatman at your table?  Wow.  Congrats on you and Ant describing Bob Eatman perfectly throughout the years. 
[01:40:00]  Scary.  He ordered brains.  Jeez.  Back up the video slightly and you get to hear Bob Eatman talk.  He is a monumental dud.  Hello.  Bella.  Here's Bob Eatman.  Thanks.  Sir?  They're going to be, uh...  They're going to be...  Oh, it's after that.  I've got to wait with a sir.  They're going to be a hot and most joyous business. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  All right.  You've got to...  By the way, Bob...  You don't have to watch the whole video.  Watch the video because the Bob Kelly fucking with Club Soda Kenny's crotch...  Oh, right, right, right, right.  He has what Bob Kelly calls teacher cock.  Yeah.  Yeah, teacher cock.  It's when you sit down and your pants kind of fold in the front.  You know how your fly kind of folds in the front and makes it look like you almost have  a boner?  Yeah, we...  It's head boner.  I know.  Pants boner.  Pants boner.  Pants boner, right.  Yeah, pants boner. 
[01:41:00]  He starts squeezing it and hitting it.  Yeah, Bob Kelly was squeezing it and pushing down on it.  And Kenny's just sitting there.  Yeah.  There's a monster on screen.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jesus.  Renfrew.  Swallow a spider suit.  Push play so we get to hear Bobby.  Bobby Eatman.  Jimmy Comet.  Hot at the end.  Here it is.  Watch.  Oh, this is Super Agent Bobby Eatman.  First time on camera ever. 
[01:41:30]  This is hella charisma.  Makes love for the camera.  That's all he did was a hello.  Hello.  And he's getting beat up.  If he was on camera, like I said, 10 or 15 seconds.  I love the fact that Bob tried to talk.  Rewind Bob's part again, Kenny.  Can you see Bob about to say hello and he didn't want to blow his cue?  Watch Bob.  He doesn't even know when to say hello.  He doesn't even know when to say hello.  He doesn't even know when to say hello.  Just really.  Watch it.  He's strong, isn't he?  Oh, this is Super Agent Bobby Eatman.  First time on camera.  Do you have to say hello? 
[01:42:00]  He blew his hello.  His little hitchhikers.  Because then I hope he said first time on camera.  Yeah.  So I threw him for a loop.  I threw off his wall.  I threw off his wall.  Unnatural fool.  And then look at Jimmy's stupid cat fucking ball that he's eating his soup from.  I didn't film that, unfortunately.  No, Dave.  I saw a clip of it.  It looked like a what?  A derby hat?  A little derby hat.  Yeah.  No.  I was eating a nice freeze frame.  There's some really amazing freeze frames of me available on this from the side.  Are you throwing up on the food first, dude? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, this is just a grossness.  There are some fucking freeze frames of the kid.  Holy shit.  It doesn't look like it.  It really does look like I'm vomiting on my food.  Oh, fucking God, dude.  It's Brundle Jim.  This video turned out pretty well.  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio. 
[01:43:00]  And even though we're going on vacation, I'm going to be videoing my ass off.  Ant's going to be doing his thing that we don't talk about much.  But we're not really going away the next two weeks.  Just doing the main.  I'm doing a staycation.  Grabbing a corncowder.  Are you guys just having lunch?  Yeah.  A little breakfast, yeah.  Where is this place?  This place rules.  It's close.  Yeah.  Ixnay on the Olayation K.  It's our spot.  Is it really?  Oh, God.  It could be the coolest spot in all of New York City. 
[01:43:30]  What is your lip doing?  What kind of food?  We're freeze-framing.  We're going frame by frame.  Whatever.  Watching Jimmy eat.  And right now, his mouth is opening like a fucking stroke.  Are you sticking your tongue out to touch the food?  That is so fucking fast.  I don't know.  It's weird because you're eating soup.  You're like...  Just take your mouth and go...  Oh, God. 
[01:44:00]  Look at this.  It's a drip.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  But that's...  It was serious.  You thought he was playing.  But look at this.  No.  No, I wasn't playing.  This is some of the best eating videos.  No, he's like the senator from the Edgemen.  Yeah, he's...  Fucking...  Molluscum.  Oh, God.  There's nothing better than framing the timing this video as Jimmy is eating. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, man.  You'll never eat again.  That's right there.  Oh, look at this.  Look at what's going to drip into the bowl on his lip.  Oh, just look at me.  It's a crab soup.  It's a crab and corn chowder.  It's a crab eating it.  Yes.  There's going to be some freeze framing for this video.  Oh, dude.  It's awful.  Holy shit.  Maybe Jimmy's the star of the video after all.  Oh!  Oh!  What are you doing?  It's like Sly Stallone with Bell's Palsy. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  I'm eating soup.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn.  That is fucking funny.  Oh, poor thing.  Poor thing.  It's like the end of Terms of Redeemer.  Michael Vick would have drowned you.  He was drowning himself.  Oh, no.  Fucking my ugly to the side.  And then you've got the waiter who's happy to be there, too happy to be there.  Look at that face. 
[01:45:30]  Too much going on in this video.  Another huge spoonful of goodness.  Oh, they really look delicious.  You was there to him?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's just right next to him.  Okay.  Yeah.  He makes an appearance later in the video.  I'm laughing now.  Actually, the magic of video.  We started the video without Anthony there.  And Anthony showed up.  Look at him.  Just pushing on him.  What the fuck is wrong with Bobby, man?  I'm telling you, just pushing on Club Soda Kenny's penis.  Boy, my nose points down.  I am awful from the side. 
[01:46:00]  That is one of your best fucking videos.  I like this one.  Just slow-mo and...  Oh, very funny.  That is very funny.  That is truly terrible.  Jimmy eating.  OP radio on YouTube.  Let's move on to Anthony's appearance on our show.  Just please take Jimmy frame by frame on that video.  You'll laugh your balls off.  Wait, 2.35 on YouTube, 2 minutes, 35 seconds is when you see Jimmy's sickness.  Go in 2 minutes, 35 seconds, and then just frame one frame at a time. 
[01:46:30]  You could probably get 10 to 20 good shots.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Something tells me that they're going to poke fun at me.  I think there might be some Photoshopping and just some fun things.  Hey, they wouldn't have the guts.  They wouldn't dare mock me eating.  They're going to forget about Bobby even really quickly.  God damn, that's funny.  The comments are just ridiculous on that one.  All right, so we started the show with somebody saying that some liberal guy on Sean Hannity  beat the shit out of you.  And we got the proof that that's not true, right? 
[01:47:00]  I fucking nailed the guy.  Every comment from everybody that watched it said, I just shut him down.  Shut him right down.  Hey, let's get into this.  We got a couple clips of Anthony on Hannity.  Hannity intros, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  And he is the co-host of the ever-popular Opie and Anthony show, which broadcasts on Sirius XM  satellite radio.  Anthony Cumia is here.  What's up with the bedwetting Obama-supporting liberal co-host of yours?  Why isn't he here?  What a fucking asshole. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  Bedwetting.  He certainly...  Yeah, that's me.  Like, I care enough to be that.  Bedwetting.  Bedwetting liberal.  That's always a fun one.  Bedwetting liberal.  What is that?  They're just always pissing themselves in their beds.  He goes, why isn't he here?  Oh, Opie?  I should throw, like, a Hillary hissy fit and say, it's about me.  I'm here.  Talk about me.  Yeah, you're probably right.  No, I think you just answered your own question.  That's why he's not here.  Oh, he doesn't...  Because he admits that he voted for Obama.  He doesn't want to admit it anymore.  Well...  Didn't vote for Obama, Sean.  You know that. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to stop the tape every second.  You didn't.  I didn't vote.  He wants you on that show so fucking bad.  And I openly said I didn't vote.  But that would be funny, though.  If he said you voted for Obama and you know that, you'd go, no.  I don't vote.  All right.  Maybe I got an angle now.  Maybe I got an angle.  Calling out on his lies.  Voting's easy.  And by the way, George Carlin has the greatest reason not to vote.  Thank you.  Yes.  That's what we bring up all the time.  Greatest bits ever.  Like, just, I will not vote.  Because then if you vote, you can't...  You can't complain.  You can't complain. 
[01:48:30]  You're part of the problem.  Yes.  I don't vote, so I can...  I don't like none of these pieces of shit, so I can complain.  George, he was the master at taking the most obvious thing  that nobody else saw.  And he took that argument.  People have been having for 50 years about voting,  and he made it fucking funny and original.  Made you feel not guilty about voting.  You just go...  Because no one ever had an answer to that.  It's like, well, if you don't vote, you can't...  Then you can't complain about the...  You can complain if you don't vote.  That's why I can complain.  Because I didn't vote. 
[01:49:00]  That's great.  Oh, shit.  Not that that's the right message to send.  Shit.  Guy that ruins every moment for trying to be serious.  Because he admits that he voted for Obama.  He doesn't want to admit it anymore.  Well, yeah, he...  Hey, did I vote for Obama?  I want to be on record and say I did not vote.  I haven't voted for a president in a long time.  I think you might be literal on that, though.  I think he's saying you are a supporter.  It doesn't even matter.  He's trying to coax you and beat you onto the show. 
[01:49:30]  I'm not as rah-rah as far as Obama goes.  That's for sure.  Oh, really?  Maybe that's what he's saying.  I want to hear the tapes of you going, Obama!  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  That is true.  You did yell Obama.  I've changed a little bit.  Now it's cocaine!  Cocaine!  I just...  New boss, same as the old boss.  Well, not quite.  I like Obama a lot more than I would have liked...  New boss, same as the old boss.  I like his words, and I would have liked some of them.  High five.  Air high five.  Pachoo-pachoo.  Well, yeah, he kind of... 
[01:50:00]  He was brought in by the whole change thing, and this is going to be great.  It's going to be a different thing.  And then business as usual, tax and spend Democrat, and he can't really defend himself, so...  Well, thank God he's got you and Norton to straighten him out.  Yeah, yeah, we like to straighten that out.  I like getting feedback, too, on the show when I talk about things like that, where one guy  will say, oh my God, you're a conservative, right-wing, radical, and then the next one  will be like, I agree with you 100%.  You're more libertarian.  I'm more like a Christian conservative. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I do have a few views that kind of drift over.  I never want to say left, but a little more center.  Kind of drift?  You're for gay marriage?  That's a fucking pogo leap from the Christian...  Well, it is.  I'm not...  You know what it is, though?  I'm not for gay marriage.  We don't care.  I could give a flying fray.  Fuck about gay marriage is what it is.  You are a...  Asshole.  No.  You are a logical, reasonable racist.  Thank you.  That's what you do.  I like to be...  I like to... 
[01:51:00]  An intelligent, that racist.  I'm going to run on that platform.  You're not...  You've got some intelligence behind your racism.  It's just that you can't get past black and Puerto Rican.  I have preconceived notions that I have a very hard time disposing  of, but yet, every time I am friendly with ethnically diverse people,  I never have a problem with people I'm friendly with.  I'm very friendly with you, Patrice.  I become...  You are my Negro friend.  We become us as opposed to them when you meet us.  Drew Boogie. 
[01:51:30]  I am friendly with Drew Boogie.  But you don't even know what Drew Boogie's nationality is.  No one does.  No one does.  Drew was a thing.  If we're friends with Drew, we're all friends with something else.  Yeah, yeah.  Some don't know.  He's black and Dominican.  He's got like a thin Dominican mustache.  If I had to guess, I would say there's some Asian.  Exactly.  There's something.  There's some Asian.  Mendoza.  Asian?  Asian?  There was some...  There was some cottage rape going on during this.  Cottage rape?  There was some... 
[01:52:00]  Fucking...  The father from the Brady Bunch was tiptoeing in.  Fucking somebody.  Ed Asner hopped off the boat and did a little fucking...  There was some funny shit going on in Drew's family.  What are you?  I'm Jamaican, but my parents are mixed.  There's a lot of mixing going on back then.  Do you speak patois?  Yeah.  Really?  How do you speak that?  Well, actually, I kind of don't.  Sorry.  Sorry to disappoint you, Jimmy.  That's all right.  Yeah, because what do you got?  Like hazel eyes or something? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Hazel!  Hazel!  Without the H.  Hazel!  Hazel highs.  It goes on the...  Before the E one.  It's an old fucking death jam, but Hazel highs.  My name is Drew Boogie.  I love Jamaican, Jimmy.  The boy's a body man!  Ah, shit. 
[01:53:00]  The blood clot pretty baby.  Boo.  The Jamaicans always suck their teeth, too.  Yeah?  They're always miserable.  What's that all about?  Oh, it works.  I can't...  It's true.  I don't even know what that's about.  Oh, he mustn't...  It's true, though.  And he learned all of that from them fucking Jamaican bitches that's pushing on these white  babies around Manhattan.  Yeah.  He's just watching them do their fucking thing.  Sucking their teeth. 
[01:53:30]  But he's dicking in your ass, though.  Huh?  He wants a piece of you.  That's all right.  Whatever.  He wants a piece of you.  I don't have passion for the fight.  He wants you on the show.  He really does.  I want to talk sports or something else.  I don't...  Right.  Oh, same-o, same-o.  But by this time, Anthony, you must know it's the old same-o.  It's just the same-o, same-o.  Well, you know how I prepped for the show?  I sat there and watched Fox News and all the other shows for about two hours. 
[01:54:00]  Glenn Beck and stuff like that.  And then...  And then just repeated stuff.  And then what's his name?  Fucking Bill O'Reilly.  And then I'm like, all right.  Sound bites, man.  I'll just repeat that.  Hannity banned me from his show.  He don't want to talk to me no more since Kramer and him.  Oh, well.  Well, you had one of them.  Was it on Hannity?  The legendary quote with a woman?  It was John Gibson, but...  Yeah, Gibson.  I got some good ones that are on Hannity.  You pretty much got...  You pretty much wrecked John Gibson's TV career with that one.  You know that, right?  Nah, they fucked it up.  I haven't seen him back since. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, he's gone.  You were funny on Hannity, though.  You were very funny on Hannity.  Yeah, I was good on Hannity.  You were good on Hannity?  And I laugh at him because he always tries to make you...  The black people always got to come in and be the...  Like, if he had me on for Michael Vick, he would have fucking had me on to be the guy  that goes...  Nick White, you don't understand.  Like, I couldn't have that view.  He would have been like, what good are you?  I need a...  We have to play this.  Oh, yeah.  Radio Crackdown, Patrice O'Neal.  Just find where it starts there, Danny, for me, please.  This is one of my favorite Patrice O'Neal things ever.  I love this one. 
[01:55:00]  He fucking fucked this woman.  She was the worst.  In her place so bad.  They're talking about Radio Crackdown.  Was this the Imus thing?  No, this is ONA.  This is you.  They were trying to get rid of you.  Oh, for the...  They were talking about fucking...  Homeless Charlie?  Yeah.  But also they're talking about Elvis.  No, Jesus.  JV and Elvis, too.  JV and Elvis.  And I was mad at her because she was sitting there.  And this was behind.  This was from me watching what she was doing behind.  She wouldn't speak to me, Sonia Osario.  She wouldn't speak to me, but she...  Was she from now?  Yeah, National Association of Women.  Yep.  And she was like, fire them.  And I was like, you fucking bitch. 
[01:55:30]  You just, like, fire people.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, have them fired.  Like, just flick.  Didn't even care.  Just her position was her position.  What a fucking ass.  Yeah, she sucks.  Just to bring everyone to the table, Homeless Charlie made some crazy, you know...  Funny remarks.  Can we play that again?  Can we play that?  We should be able to.  Let's fucking play Homeless Charlie, for Christ's sake.  And the thing about that, he never said anything...  We never...  He never said anything towards them.  No. 
[01:56:00]  I listened to that fucking thing.  No, no.  Isn't he a funny dude, man?  He was a naturally funny guy.  He was just ridiculous, man.  He was just a funny, funny homeless guy.  A funny fucking homeless dude.  Saying stuff about the First Lady and...  And that Bush bitch.  He called Condoleezza Rice the Bush bitch.  Yeah.  He was funny.  And pretty much we were observers just watching Homeless Charlie do his thing.  Fuck the Queen of England.  We've never seen Homeless Charlie since, by the way.  We used to see him on the streets of New York.  We haven't seen him since.  Fucking black van pulled up and threw him in.  I think he got a case of the food poisoning.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  He's got a water car guy food.  It's somewhere.  I think we got orders to nuke all copies of that audio.  It's somewhere.  That was when the merger was going through.  It's got to be somewhere.  You know how stupid that statement is when there's probably another 100 to 200 copies  out there?  Now these days.  This ain't fucking...  This ain't the...  What is it?  Right.  The old Tonight Show.  The Nixon tapes?  What is it?  Watergate, motherfucker?  I can't burn tapes no more.  No, the old Honeymooners.  The Honeymooners where they lost a few episodes because they didn't think anyone wanted to 
[01:57:00]  see this shit 30, 40 years later.  They recorded over stuff.  Right.  What is that?  How stupid is that?  We had to destroy old copies and there's hundreds of other copies.  That's going to be silly.  What are you going to start knocking on listeners' doors?  Who is that Bush bitch?  What did that accomplish in the end?  That Charlie made me fucking laugh, man.  I'm just saying, there it is.  Yeah, there's the Patrice thing.  So we got Patrice O'Neill.  When that whole thing went down, he was invited to go on Fox and listen to what he does to  this woman. 
[01:57:30]  With me now, new city president, now new city president, Sonia Osario.  Stupid.  She took part in a recent protest calling for radio stations to stop supporting negative  language in music and talk radio.  And also, our favorite stand-up comic, Patrice O'Neill.  Thank you, sir.  Patrice, are ONA next?  I hope not.  I hope JV, I wish JV and Elvis didn't lose their job or Imus.  It's funny.  This is the thing.  I don't know her, but I'm assuming that she has nothing to do with funny. 
[01:58:00]  So I'm going to speak as the expert on funny.  Funny people should just be left to try to be funny.  What if they're not funny?  You made a mistake.  But how many, listen, how many times has the unfunny, how many unfunny rape jokes lead  to rape?  I don't know how many jokes about rape there are.  There's a lot.  But your world is not funny.  Your world is...  Next on the big story.  My world is people trying to be funny.  Well, I mean, you think it's okay to try to make jokes about rape?  I'm diabetic. 
[01:58:30]  I make fun of that.  I'm a victim.  I might lose a toe.  But I'm trying to make fun of anything I think I can make fun of.  Sonia?  You know, what's happening now is the marketplace is deciding what's appropriate or what's not  appropriate.  I think the nation is just tired.  There's a new mood in the nation.  Oh, wait.  Pause that for one second.  This is why you gotta hate women like this.  The marketplace decides what's appropriate.  So how about if the marketplace dictates that women should make less money, you dopey 
[01:59:00]  bitch?  Is that appropriate?  Yeah.  Or should what is quote-unquote right rise above what the fucking marketplace dictates?  Shut up.  Look, if the marketplace dictated it, it would show in the ratings and then they would fire  you for low ratings.  Right.  The marketplace is gauged in radio and television by ratings.  So if it's a high-rated show, but they're saying shit you don't like.  But just speaking in logic, though.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what no one does ever. 
[01:59:30]  It's not allowed anywhere is that you make a logical point.  She's not being logical.  She's just being a horrible representative of now.  God forbid the head of New York, New York's president of now would come out and go, I found  the comments disgusting, but you know what?  In a free society, you're going to hear things that are unpleasant to hear.  As long as they're not seriously advocating rape or violence against women, I have no problem  with it.  God forbid a fucking liberal would ever, or a conservative for that matter, have that 
[02:00:00]  kind of a take on it.  Don't be too upset, because Patrice really...  Oh, he destroyed her.  Oh, I know.  He really put her in her place.  Oh, my God, yes.  And is it true that Angela Yee is pissed off about our Mary and Barry stuff last week?  How do you know, Patrice?  They're saying, ask Patrice.  I was...  I didn't want to get in the middle of this, but I wouldn't say...  Who is she?  She runs the morning show at the Black Station.  I know why she's married.  But she's...  I told her when I was on the radio, the Mary and Barry thing, I told her that was an issue. 
[02:00:30]  Why?  It was an issue.  That was their scheduled time, and I think it took away from Mary.  A few things is, they have to fight.  I apologize for that.  I do apologize for that.  I told her that was as simple as one, two, three.  I thought she was mad because we had her guest after she did.  She was upset about...  Oh, and then somebody said a comment.  This is...  Now that I'm talking. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Go.  The comment was, come over to here, and this is supposedly, come over here.  Don't you want to have more people listen to me?  I said we had the...  I said that to him.  All right, please.  I said we...  I didn't say blow off any show.  I said we have the biggest audience on the platform right now that you can hear.  And then he decided to come in for a minute.  I didn't drag him in.  That was the truth.  And hold on.  I'm not...  No, but let's get the facts out.  We said that not knowing that he was just on her show.  We had no idea what show Mary and Barry was doing.  That's what no one knows. 
[02:01:30]  We weren't taking a shot at her.  We don't even know her.  Exactly.  No, no, no.  I actually wasn't taking a shot at her at all.  I didn't know where he was scheduled because a lot of times these people didn't come through.  And I told her just to come say something.  Just say, you know, as opposed to, you know, it's not going to be a radio war.  It's just like, I know they didn't just disrespect the thing.  But the thing is, what she's upset about is that, you know, again, everything is racially divided.  It's not you guys, it's that when they have to get people to sign in over there, it has 
[02:02:00]  to be four or five days.  They have to do a record check, you know, because it's possible a mass murderer could just walk  up in there and the white shows could just be like, somebody's coming up now.  No, we're not happy that we broadcast so close in our studio.  We watched the Hot 97 shit that used to go down.  You know, they make, there's some things, you know, but it could be squashed.  I said that.  With immediate.  I said that, but it wasn't in the vein of fuck Shane.  No, we actually liked Shane 45. 
[02:02:30]  It simply was.  We have Wookin.  We have the biggest audience.  Wookin on all the time.  At least next to Howard, we have the biggest audience that he would have got on.  So it was like, why wouldn't you come on?  And then a minute later, he came in.  Do you see what a misunderstanding is?  And then it goes from the top down.  But I'm like, y'all are neighbors.  I mean, fucking Sharon, like Hannah went from here right over there.  It's just fucking, it's what it is.  And you went from here to there.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I'm just like, dude, it's over.  He's a politician.  That's how you get him on.  And if we took time away from her time, then yeah, we're wrong. 
[02:03:00]  So that's it.  There you go.  Let's get back to Patrice giving this woman a beating.  That's not appropriate.  I think the nation is just tired.  There's a new mood in the nation.  What nation?  The nation.  You know what?  We're tired of things that are just.  It's just the nation that's paper and you, I'm not the nation.  I'm just speaking for me and funny.  You're speaking for the nation or are you speaking for.  Yeah.  You know why?  Because I remember six years ago.  Why is man cow on?  Doing something against Anthony Openey because they were just so outrageous and their violent 
[02:03:30]  images that they put out to women was just uncalled for.  And now, now I think people.  You think they were trying to be funny?  I think now people in this country are tired.  You know what?  I don't care if they're trying to be funny.  That's what I'm saying.  Why are you in that business?  I've been to your show once and it wasn't very funny being a woman.  It was hilarious.  When you talked about.  That's why she doesn't like me.  I was in the paper with her and the joke is hilarious called the angry pirate.  And the lady who wrote it and her outrage didn't even know what it meant. 
[02:04:00]  And anybody who read it laughed because they know what's funny.  You're not living in the context of funny.  You're living in the context of fire.  All these guys have every right to be as funny as they want.  They can go out and try to be as funny as they want.  Make as much money.  Make as much money being as funny as they want.  This is what's happening.  There is a change in this country.  People are realizing they have an opportunity to speak out.  And advertisers are listening.  You're not talking.  You're not talking.  You're not talking to who I talk to.  And you're not going to get paid as much money anymore. 
[02:04:30]  Sonia and Patrice.  Look at this.  The marketplace is speaking.  More CBS radio firings.  They've been on a tear lately.  All right.  Are they cleaning house or is this the PC cops run amok?  You know what it is, John.  You know what it is while you're reading that paper.  It's the PC cops run amok.  Do you think she's a PC cop?  Of course she is.  She has an entire encyclopedia of her stance on it.  But it's no passion involved.  It's not a real.  This is just what she has to say.  We are outraged and fired and fired and fired. 
[02:05:00]  A name calling.  I'm outraged.  I am outraged.  You should be.  I am a fool.  Now, if I called you a fool.  Ah!  You know what?  People are getting a new sense of entitlement to PCC in this country.  Who are the people?  A new sense of entitlement to PCC in this country.  Here's my question.  How can you justify a bad joke?  A joke that isn't funny.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  An attempt that isn't funny, doesn't get any laughs, and is about raping the first black 
[02:05:30]  woman to ever become the Secretary of State of the United States?  Well, who gives the fuck if she's black?  Well, why not?  The attempt is what I'm trying to fight for.  The joke may or may.  Funny jokes and unfunny jokes come out of the same birth.  You don't know if anything is going to be funny.  You should attempt to be able to make anything funny.  Don't you think a joke about rape is doomed to be not funny?  It's possible, but I've heard them.  I've heard them.  You've heard a funny rape joke? 
[02:06:00]  No.  I'd say a couple.  Watch my HL special.  I'm pretty good at it.  But she says that if you're having sex with a woman, doggy style, and if you hit her in  the head just the right time.  No, it's ejaculate in her eye and kick her in the shin, and she walks around like, argh.  It's the angry fire.  That's what she was trying to say.  A violent act of hitting her in the back of her head, her body.  It's called the donkey crunch.  Which will then...  Why are you laughing?  She's outraged.  It's called the donkey punch.  It's called humor that she has no clue what it is. 
[02:06:30]  We have the same problem that Opie and Anthony does.  You can't say just anything on the air.  You can say anything you want.  It might not be funny.  You might get in trouble for it, but you should be able to be attentive.  And plus, when is a crazy bum going to get an opportunity to rape the president's wife,  John?  It was trying to be funny.  All right, Patrice, why aren't I hearing Al Sharpton complain about this thing involving  Congress?  Because it wasn't involving young black women.  Well, it was involving a very prominent black woman. 
[02:07:00]  Well, where was she during young black...  Everybody has their agenda.  I was there.  I was there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, why am I not hearing from Sharpton?  Because it doesn't concern him.  It's not concerning him.  It's black...  It's...  You know...  Come on, Al.  You know, Al Sharpton has his agenda, and it was perfect for Al.  Young black women.  And now she's representing just women in general.  She's not representing the nappy-ho part.  She's representing just the hoe.  The nappy-headed part?  She has nothing to do with it. 
[02:07:30]  Just the hoe.  You know what?  Women have been abused publicly in the media for too long, and people are tired of it.  This has been a beautiful response of just the general public saying to advertisers,  we're your consumers.  We don't want to have to avoid everything in the street.  We don't want to have to worry about what radio station we turn on.  And there is some really derogatory, violent thing to deal with.  That information, ma'am, is secondhand from someone making you aware that someone may 
[02:08:00]  have said something that you should be upset about.  It's a shame.  Your constituents...  The people you represent aren't all victims in this matter.  Teresa O'Neill, thank you very much.  Sonia, sorry.  Thanks to both of you.  I appreciate it.  Time for big politics.  Check that dumb bitch.  That was John Gibson going, holy shit.  I can't believe we used to be angry pirate.  You know what John said to me?  He said, I have to apologize.  For what I did to her. 
[02:08:30]  Because he knew what I was going to do to her.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he said, man, I had to apologize to her for...  He set her up.  Oh, fuck.  To be...  Yeah.  He just was enjoying...  Of course he was.  ...just how ridiculous she was sounding.  That fucking...  You killed her.  ...just unfunny...  ...over the time...  Do you think...  I can never picture a woman like that with her fucking legs pinned back just getting slammed...  Oh, I absolutely can. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, absolutely I can, too.  ...and going, like, yeah, fuck me.  She turned me on, that goddamn bitch.  Yeah, she's sexy.  She was pretty hot.  I think when she's not on TV, that's exactly what's going on.  Oh, you think she likes being smacked in her hair?  Dude, I put money on it.  I put money on it.  And the thing is, she laughed a couple of times, too.  But she just really fell apart.  Dude, you were arguing what the Angry Pirate is all about.  That is so funny.  On Fox News.  No, that's the docket punch.  Do you understand how amazing that is?  That will never be done again.  Oh, they...  I was... 
[02:09:30]  I haven't been on there since.  I haven't seen Fox News since.  Handy would throw me on a bone every couple of times.  It was a wrap after John Gibson had to apologize the next day.  You would give him great TV every time out, man.  I got it.  You got to play by their rules, though.  If you don't play by their rules, you're out.  That is some good shit.  Let's get back to Anthony on Sean Hannity from last night.  Ant starts going after the liberal guy.  This is what the caller brought up a couple hours ago?  Oh, God, Jimmy. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  The insurance reforms, the cost spending, all those things that people are concerned about,  they want addressed.  They may not want everything that's in the House bill, but they want health reform,  but that's not government health care.  That is restructuring, perhaps, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals.  Government health care is a talking point.  I think that should be a look at it.  Government health care is a talking point.  There's not anybody talking about it.  The government is not taking over anything.  No, that was an election.  That was a campaign promise.  By whom?  By Barack Obama.  Let me quote him. 
[02:10:30]  He said that he wanted to get rid of, in 2007, the employee's benefit system if it takes  10, 15, or 20 years and he wants a single person.  See, he said, he was trying to say that health care reform was a talking point.  It's like, no, dummy.  That was his whole fucking platform.  People hate Hannity because he always had a fact.  There's another way to argue with somebody that has facts and dates.  When someone says, look, in April, I'll be like, oh, fuck off. 
[02:11:00]  It's one of the things that makes me, I seriously daydream when I'm on there, just tapping him  on his shoulder and go, what is that?  Take all his stupid papers and throw them and have him have a regular conversation.  He has a pile of papers and weaponry when you come in.  It's always a knife and a gunfight.  You can't come more prepared than Sean Hannity.  Exactly.  That's a good thing.  Here's you, Anthony, farting. 
[02:11:30]  What do you have to say about that?  Well, that's my job.  I farted?  You're on the show.  It's ridiculous.  I've never seen him just have a goddamn regular human conversation, man.  You know what he did last night at one point, which was just like, I don't know how he did  this, talking about the bill, which the health care bill, which is probably over a thousand  pages long.  And he goes, somebody brought something up and he goes, no, no, page 16.  That says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, he fucking picked out page 16. 
[02:12:00]  It's horrifying.  I knew what the fuck was on it.  Why do you think the average citizen is finished?  Why do you think we're done?  I mean, these HR things, whatever they call it, House of Representatives 1306, they're  a thousand pages long.  What's the bill, the goddamn $787 million, billion dollars, the stimulus package.  It's fucking 1,200 pages long and they didn't give him a day to read it. 
[02:12:30]  They just said, this is it, just sign it.  And it's fucking shocking, but this shit is weaponry.  You come to these fucking things and this guy has a pile of papers and he just says a  statement.  You're saying, and it's sound bites and you're flustered and you're like, give me two minutes  to get a thought together.  You know what's fucking amazing?  The original, like, bill of rights is, it's like a page.  It's one page. 
[02:13:00]  I got a booklet.  Here it is.  Bill of rights.  And then it turns into thousand, multi-thousand page, uh, legalese bullshit that no one could  understand.  No one reads through.  It's signed on party lines.  Oh, who wrote it?  A Democrat?  I don't have to read it.  Then I'll just sign it if I'm a Democrat.  And if I'm a Republican, I'm fucking, I won't sign off on it.  Well, we're at the last stages of the, of all these plans anyway, cause they're going  after white folks.  Yeah.  Now that white folks are getting involved with this, with the anti-government thing, the 
[02:13:30]  fucking town hall meetings.  Shit's going to hit the fucking fan now.  All the, all the, the networks, CBS, uh, NBC, MSNBC, they're treating these town hall things  like fucking Klan meetings and Nazi.  They're saying that they're, they're using these tactics of political terrorism.  They call it.  And I know why?  Cause it's a different face of the people that are protesting.  It's fucking middle-class white people.  Holy shit.  They finally got off their ass and went to protest. 
[02:14:00]  This is where we all should be coming together, but we don't.  No.  Because.  You guys come together and protest.  But we come together, but this is a people problem.  Flames and TVs running outdoors.  This is, this is why black people are going to sit back and watch what black people have  been complaining about middle-class white folks who are now becoming poor, um, and scared.  Yeah.  Saying the same thing that black people have been saying for years, but we all should be  together because I'm going to tell you the militia, the people in the mountains.  Yeah.  They're, they're really the, they, they're the closest to thinking like the people who made 
[02:14:30]  the bill of rights in the constitution.  They're really the anti-tax, the anti-government in your life because conservative and, and,  and, and liberal, I don't know where it's, it's turned into this white, black and it's  poor.  Conservative is just supposed to be people who don't like a lot of government, right?  Who don't like a lot of bullshit in their government.  These people in the hills that they're now going to, they're making a terrorist.  They're not talking about fucking, first of all, Iraq don't exist. 
[02:15:00]  No more than there.  Now it's Afghanistan and now the war on terror is here.  The white militia groups who won't pay taxes and will fight, but black people need to be  on their side to supporting them, the guns and everything else.  But they split us down the middle.  And if these fucking stuff saying hate niggas and hate Jews and hate Puerto Ricans as a people,  we can be together.  But the fact is some of this shit is they hate me, but I'm like, I'm on your side.  You fucking goofy bastard. 
[02:15:30]  Don't, I'm saying you should be live free because somebody said something one time about  democracy.  Democracy is not freedom.  Democracy is 51% of the people control 49% of the people.  Essentially it's, as they say, two wolves and a sheep voting for dinner, voting for what's  for dinner.  That's what democracy is.  It's not really free.  Technically we are a representative republic.  We are not a democracy. 
[02:16:00]  One of Norton's farts for that.  Oh, you want one?  Oh, shit.  Give me a second.  Because look, man, the fucking militia, I see what's going on, as they call a big sister  now.  They call her because the lady that, for some bitch runs the, I mean, some woman.  I mean, my phone taps and shit.  Some lovely woman runs the fucking whatever, the security, and now the biggest thing is  these Timothy McVeigh motherfuckers and these crazy guys, and so now we got to watch them. 
[02:16:30]  But they're not really bothering anybody.  They're up in the hills doing goofy shit, like shooting targets of me.  Instead of just saying to people, look, we're sorry, black people.  You're not paranoid.  You're not fucking assholes.  Now it's hitting us, and we apologize for all the shit that we called you paranoid for.  Now it's coming down on us, and when we fix it, then you can go back to being niggas,  and we can go back to being crackers and don't like each other, because that's the way we are.  But right now, we, you know, right now, we got to be together on this one, man. 
[02:17:00]  I'm telling you.  But we're not.  There is a huge intrusion of government right now that is really, it's the beginning of  it, especially with Obama.  And white arrogance is what's making it step up along with the arrogance of white people  to say, oh, what the, who the, and when I say white, not skin, just the institution  of why, oh, this is preposterous, when now cops are fucking black, white people are talking 
[02:17:30]  about martial law and police brutality, and they're talking about the government intruding,  they're having their homes taken, they're having just complete disrespect, now white  people are dealing with it, now it's an issue.  Well, when the White House puts out statements like, if you see anything fishy about the healthcare  reform facts, if you see any websites, or you get any emails that are fishy, could you  forward them to the White House?  They want, they want people to turn in other people, bloggers, and they fucking watch Twitter 
[02:18:00]  and all that shit now.  If that was George Bush saying that, if that was the Bush White House saying that, holy shit,  every fucking liberal Democrat would be all over it.  That's true.  All over it.  But they should have been all over it.  Look, what is K.R.S. on this thing?  It's like, look, if you're going to McDonald's, man, and if you're going to McDonald's, and  your burger's delicious, but the manager's a dick, right? 
[02:18:30]  And you go, this fucking manager, I hate this motherfucker, he won't give me extra ketchup,  he's a dick.  Now, they can fire him, get rid of him, put another manager in, but he can't change the  franchise.  He can't change what McDonald's is.  It can't be, here's my new burger, it's called the McNigga Burger, and fucking Obama is,  he's, he's, the country is the franchise, man.  They already have that burger, it's called the Fish Fallon. 
[02:19:00]  For real, man, it's like, this shit is ridiculous.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken, fucking fried chicken finger, let's get fried chicken,  fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken.  I love peaches chicken.  Hey, can we get the rest of Anthony and Sean Hannity? 
[02:19:30]  We got two more clips to do here.  God damn, Patrice.  You fucking know how to spell it out.  Yeah, he's an intelligent man.  And questions why you would change health care.  Yeah, why would you take, I hear, what, 84% of the people that have health care and are  happy with it.  You know what?  Why would you try to change something that has such a success rate?  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  Because they're worried if they lose their job, they're going to lose their coverage,  you won't be able to get it.  They're worried about if they have a pre-existing condition, it won't be covered.  They're worried if they get sick, they won't be able to buy health insurance. 
[02:20:00]  If they're so worried, why are they out in mass?  Why are these middle class people out in mass?  In mass.  Why are they out at these town hall meetings being angry like you've never seen these people?  These aren't interest groups.  This isn't Reverend Al bringing someone over or Charlie Rangel.  This is America, middle class America coming out and angry.  A lot of things that have nothing to do with health care reform.  Partisanship is back.  The partisan divide in America is there.  These are people that have never been involved in anywhere.  These are people that founded the Tea Party. 
[02:20:30]  They're angry.  It's right in there.  See, that motherfucker.  Just don't even.  You've got to go full-time politics eventually.  I'm telling you.  Full-time politics.  If I can stop drinking on the compound.  You can't be.  You're really not.  You're too fucked up to be.  You're too funny a guy to be full-time politics.  I couldn't do full-time like that.  You do too many rape jokes and race jokes and fucking ass-eating jokes.  I love that.  You can't be.  Yeah, you can.  In this position, you can at least have the barrier of, I was trying to be funny.  Exactly.  Fucking Haney at him.  He can't ever say, I was just trying to be funny. 
[02:21:00]  Bye, stupid.  Oh, no.  Glenn Beck.  No.  At least you can fucking go, tickle, tickle.  That's why I love fucking comedy.  Sean Hannity, one try at funny, career over.  He's trying.  Just one try at funny.  Career ending funny.  He thinks he's a charming.  Oh, I know he thinks he is.  He really is a click, click.  He gets fucking gunpoint.  He's a whack.  Let me tell you something.  I like this fucking.  He has fun on our show.  Sean is, you know, when the camera goes off.  Sean Hannity is who he is on the air.  And that's Sean. 
[02:21:30]  He's not bullshitting.  But when he's off the air, he's just a regular guy.  He's a regular fucking guy.  He talks about, you know, his kids fucking golfing.  He talks about it.  Whatever the fuck he does.  I told you I see him in the hallway just whistling a zippity-doo-dah.  He's not constantly fucking around.  As he's getting ready to destroy a life.  Zippity-doo-dah.  Hey, Sean.  Patrice.  Bing, bang, boobity-pow.  Zippity-day.  Who am I getting fired today? 
[02:22:00]  This fucking guy doesn't give a shit.  Holy shit.  I've seen him just whistling.  And I mean, he just is like a pig and shit, man.  He just, it's just his job.  It's just his fucking job.  And I tell you why I'm kind of glad I'm not involved in that.  That's a dangerous place to be in.  I told you I was on with Geraldo.  And that motherfucker, I was trying to talk loud over everybody like I do.  And that fucker, not you, Patrice, touched my hand when he was, like, he put his hand, 
[02:22:30]  it was a technique.  Geraldo?  Oh, yeah.  It was a fucking technique.  It was a technique.  He put his hand on me, man.  And it just, I was mesmerized.  Just because he's Geraldo, that's all it is.  It was like Cesar Millan.  Yes!  That's all it was.  He just controlled.  He just went, shush, held my wrist.  That is a, wow, that is a control move.  That was a beautiful move that I learned.  You should have grabbed his cock.  After he grabbed your arm, you grab his cock and balls.  That tells you I'm almost done. 
[02:23:00]  That's all that.  That's just going, hold on one second.  That's all.  Just be patient.  Don't interrupt me.  Yeah, we got into it with him when he came on.  This fucking idiotic, Spanish people learn English as fast as everybody else.  Argument we got into.  Yeah.  Dude, it was great.  Oh, he bugged me.  The fucking Jimmy Geraldo debate on our show.  And then on the way home, he's like, oh, what do you mean?  I'm saying that a lot of people, well, he asks you that people speak English when they  come here.  That's a solid request.  You're welcome to come.  Just try a little language.  Well, they do.  It's the same speed.  Just nonsense.  And as Opie and I are walking home, we're talking to fuck, I ask a question to three 
[02:23:30]  workers, all spoke Spanish.  None of them fucking understood what they were saying.  On cue.  Right after the interview.  How do you get mad at the Philly steak and cheese guy?  I mean.  We love him.  What was his name?  I don't know, but it's just an approach.  You can't go, hey, you filthy, rotten, wet, dirty.  You dishwashing pieces of shit, speak English.  Hey.  It's just like, can you speak English, motherfucker?  Yeah.  That's all he asks.  You don't ask for much in this country.  That's all I ask.  Speak the language, bitches.  Speak the language.  That's it. 
[02:24:00]  That's it.  That's pretty much it.  That's pretty much all we really want.  I'm not going to serve you.  I'm going to beat you in the head with this greasy meat.  You fucking wet bag.  Hey.  It just makes it easier for everyone involved if everybody has a common language.  That's all.  Let's wrap up, Anthony, on Sean Hannity so we can get to a break here.  I got to tinkle a little bit.  Oh, boy, do I.  Gregorio, I have to tinkle.  I think we've got to start peeing in studio.  Then we can continue.  Oh, pee cups is great.  I got two of them in my truck.  Yeah, I used to carry a Starbucks cup.  Oh, my master.  The giant Aquafina bottles. 
[02:24:30]  They're perfect for just the helmet.  You need the wide Aquafina.  The wide Aquafina.  What are you fucking?  I would fucking piss all over my pants.  Oh, you put the hole, right?  You put your dick right on the hole.  You put your whole head in there.  How do you tap?  I'm with you.  How do you fucking tap?  You don't know how many times you've got to.  You've got to sacrifice a little tap water when you're shitting in a cup.  You've got to sacrifice a few droplets for the car.  When I go hooker hunting, I would fucking, I would be in my car and I would hold the coffee cup on the side. 
[02:25:00]  I lean on my side.  I fucking aim my cock in.  I piss.  I fill the cup almost.  I dump it out the window.  I finish it.  Wow, you could actually cut off mid-stream.  That's crazy.  That's hard to do.  I'm a professional.  You know what, though?  You have to start doing that in advance.  You can't do it last minute.  Like, cup's almost full and cut off.  You've got to go, all right, by the time I can stop this flow, it's going to be pretty full.  Absolutely.  Florentine had a funny story about how he was pissed into a Starbucks cup.  And he didn't realize that the bottom was fucking weak and it broke. 
[02:25:30]  He was on his way to a gig.  And he fucking pissed through the cup and it went all over his jeans.  He goes, I'm going through the Lincoln Tunnel.  I had to take my jeans off and put them on the heater in the car.  He's driving with his fucking, in his underwear, with his fucking pants.  On top of the dashboard, drying his pants.  Piss smell coming off of that?  I believe one boy was from Arkansas.  Don't make me laugh.  I'm going to pee my thing.  Anthony finishes up on how he gets the last word.  Nice.  Oh, Sean, 85% of Americans like their health insurance, but 85% of Americans are worried 
[02:26:00]  about what happens if they lose their job, if they get sick.  We're not worried about it.  There's no guarantees.  There's no guarantees.  And one thing that isn't guaranteed, especially in the Constitution, is health care.  Absolutely.  Good point.  We'll end it there.  Guys, thank you for being here.  That is all the time we have.  I'll tell Opie to come on.  We'll see you back here tomorrow night.  Thanks for being with us.  Some good plugs.  They have big fans of this show over there.  All these places where they shouldn't be.  I know, right?  They're fucking quiet sons of bitches.  Just say, hey.  It's like, tell Opie I said hello. 
[02:26:30]  They're fucking big fans over there, dude.  That's a strong appearance by Anthony.  You're at home over there, brother.  Fox is very good to this show.  I got to tell you something.  Honestly, there's a certain project that I like to do from my house that has helped out  so much on regular television because you have to address the camera.  You're practicing every fucking night.  Oh, right.  I was thinking of that, man.  And I never went into it thinking that.  I just figured I'd have some fun and stuff. 
[02:27:00]  Because it's just radio with his cameras all around.  Yeah, but there's cameras all around.  And that's exactly what it is.  But it does kind of help out a little bit.  It's weird.  It's like, I noticed that I think I'm on my sixth Tonight Show.  Right, right.  I'm talking about my basement.  And Jimmy's on fucking sixth Tonight Show.  No, no, no.  I'm not even saying that.  It might have been seventh.  Who am I?  Why not?  It is a weird thing, actually.  It's actually hard to make talking points because you're actually competing with someone  else.  Yes.  Well, I figured the thing out.  It's what Patrice said.  You just got to fucking dive in and yell over people sometimes. 
[02:27:30]  That was a tough crowd.  As soon as the motherfucker has to take one breath to say the next word, you heard me  say constitution in that last clip.  I was like, and there's another constitution.  As soon as the motherfucker blink, my lungs were deflated balloons.  And then, see what I was saying?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  We have to do that in here every morning.  No way.  It's exhausting to try to get your shit in.  It's fucking, it's impossible. 
[02:28:00]  We're talking against each other all fucking morning long.  Today at noon, October 2nd tickets on sale.  See?  That's how you do it.  Don't be paused.  Just when I try to say Cleveland Improv, I'll be 21st.  If I don't say, if I go 21st, blam, boom!  October 2nd tickets on sale today at noon.  Buy them for Long Island.  That's for Norton.  And then, Patrice, who's killing today.  One of your better appearances ever, and you always kill for us, by the way.  Patrice.  I'm going to that show in Bayshore, by the way.  Well, actually, tickets are reasonably priced. 
[02:28:30]  And, uh, today at noon, millionaire.  Three hours to go.  And Patrice at the Cleveland Improv.  Next weekend, patriceoneal.com, or on Twitter.  No, not patriceoneal.com, MySpace or Twitter.  What the fuck?  Big Mama Prods.  I'm trying to get this thing up.  This guy's fucking me.  Let's do Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  I'm a follower of Patrice.  Yeah, and a MySpace, Patrice O'Neal, man.  Right on.  All right, we're going to continue in just a minute.  Opie and Anthony Drew Boogie in the house, uh, doing all this shit live for us, because  it's the day before vacation. 
[02:29:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:29:30]  Good evening. 
[02:30:00]  Good evening.  All right.  Very cool.  Drew Boogie, doing that live. 
[02:30:30]  We're going to go away for a couple of weeks.  I love that one.  Hope you don't mind.  But I was telling Anthony during the break, this is the first vacation where we're really not going away  because we have so much other stuff that we do when we're not doing the radio show  that we'll still be in contact with at least the hardcore fans.  Yeah, there's the casual fan.  Probably not.  But, I mean, the people that are following me and Ann on Twitter and Jimmy on Twitter  and checking out my videos and checking out Ann's life in the compound.  You didn't say it.  I said it.  You know, we're not really going away.  And, you know, we'll be in touch with everybody.  Yeah, there's basil teas today out there. 
[02:31:00]  Basil teas.  We don't have room for any of that stuff.  We barely have room for your fat ass.  Holy shit.  You don't think this room feels...  Oh, that was so fucking real.  That was so real.  We're no fucking...  You fat motherfucker.  We can't even have you and Big J in the same day.  We got to...  You don't think we feel a little uncomfortable with you in here?  Jesus.  Where is Big J?  This room is small.  No basil teas.  Sorry.  Dude, that's... 
[02:31:30]  God damn.  Let me tell you why that was funny.  I'm sorry.  It was from the deep, deep depths of your belly button.  That's why it was funny.  But I love you.  There was just nothing personal about it.  We ain't got room for your fat ass.  And that's the kind of statement that makes you lose weight.  Right, right.  It's just...  Somebody's trying to have an intervention with you.  But jeez, you know...  Man, I'm worried about you.  We don't even have room in this fucking place for you, you fat fuck.  Sorry, dude.  Sorry.  I got to stop eating.  Do you know what made me lose weight in 2002?  Me and fucking stupid Nick DiPaolo were having an argument, a tough crowd before it was even 
[02:32:00]  on the air.  And we're just yelling at each other, going, oh, you fat fuck.  And I'm like, if that was something he could say to me in an argument, oh, I got to do something.  You want to change my life.  You want to make sure that's not part of an argument, that they can't go down that road.  The fact that he would consider to say that angrily, I swear to God, that was almost made  me think that me and Opie are actually friends.  Right at that moment, friendship started.  That's the moment.  We don't even have room for you, you fat fucker.  I'm disgusted.  I want to be friends with Patrice. 
[02:32:30]  We just don't know how to make it happen.  It's a weird thing.  That might have been it.  Another barbecue went by.  I wasn't invited.  I saw a fucking Jimmy tweeting from your barbecue.  I did invite you.  You said something.  You was gone somewhere.  Was I invited for real?  You were with a special person in your life.  You lived.  You did something.  Yes, you were in Rochester.  Yes.  Fourth of July weekend.  I did get the invite.  I apologize.  Awesome.  Me and Danny were actually having a conversation one drunken evening about having all the comics  over to my house for a big party.  I really want to go by your fucking house for a party. 
[02:33:00]  This is ridiculous.  They'll have it on a Saturday where none of the comics can make it.  No, no, no.  Not going to do that.  That's why I'm thinking maybe during this vacation.  If we could figure some fucking day out and just have everybody.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What night?  What's the matter?  Let me tell you what's going on.  You have to have it.  Oh, wait.  Are you flying Thursday to Cleveland, Patrice?  Yes.  I got one day where I'm not doing anything.  This coming Thursday.  I got to be there.  I'm going away to Thursday.  I'm going to Wildwood.  Motherfucker.  You got to have it either on a Saturday or Sunday early or on a Monday. 
[02:33:30]  Dude, Wednesday.  Nice.  Obviously, it's got to be during a time where I'm off.  How about a Monday or Tuesday?  How about this coming Wednesday?  I can't wait.  People are doing it.  People are fine.  Just have your party.  Everyone's got fucking shit to do.  Everyone's busy.  I say Monday or Tuesday.  Just have your party.  But then we need things like, because, you know, it's not just all us.  I want, you know, stupid Bob Kelly.  How about Monday or Tuesday next week?  Monday or Tuesday works for comedians, man. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, Monday or Tuesday.  That's fine then.  Where's fucking big dumb Jay Oakerson?  Is he coming in?  How about we do our nice two-week vacation?  Yeah.  We do maybe a week and a half of radio and then...  Sick time.  Sick day.  But you just happen to have all the comedians.  Yes, party flow.  We'll call it the party flow.  The party flow.  Hey, as Jay Oakerson makes his way down the hall, a couple other things.  We got a Bobo bit we got to play.  The boys have some great audio, for real. 
[02:34:30]  Even for the people that might not be into the Bobo thing.  Les Paul dies.  We got to at least mention it.  Ninety-four years old.  Yeah, God.  Ninety-four years young.  The Les Paul guitar.  The very famous guitar.  Les Paul.  That's a black-eyed question.  You really don't know who Les Paul is?  No, that is a cross-cultural style right there.  I know a lot of things, but I just know...  You know Fender Stratocaster, right?  Dude, that is a...  That's what fucking...  Is that a guitar?  That's the one with the...  Yeah, that's what Hendrix played.  With the...  Not all of them, but that's the one Jimmy Hendrix played. 
[02:35:00]  This guy is almost like Stradivarius.  He's what Gibson...  The Les Paul is to Gibson what the Stratocaster was to Fender.  You know?  It's like the fucking guitar.  Big Jay Ogrison has entered the studio.  We're talking about Les Paul, just so you don't feel alone.  Oh, he died, right?  He died?  He's dead!  Ninety-four years old.  Yeah.  Ninety-four.  What a shame.  It was weird.  So young. 
[02:35:30]  He was being fucked and he fell into an elevator shaft.  Who saw that coming?  I love the people that say it's a big loss to the music industry.  Oh, it's not.  Ninety-four years old.  Who, that invented something?  No, he's the Les Paul.  Let me tell you something.  We got all...  We were going to get out of this guy.  It's not a loss.  It's sad.  It's sad.  It's like we don't miss Thomas Edison.  Once you invented the light bulb, you could die, bitch.  We got your knowledge.  We got your knowledge and your creativity.  We don't need anything else from you.  We're done with you.  It's not a loss.  It's sad. 
[02:36:00]  Really, man?  Was it Marconi?  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah?  We don't need you, bitch.  You already invented it.  I'm talking into a mic.  It's going out somewhere.  Bye, funny man.  Bye, stupid.  Right.  Don't need you anymore.  We got all your information.  He's got everything we needed from you.  It's not a big loss to the industry.  Yeah, exactly.  If the George Washington carpeted a peanut, gotta throw it in.  Yeah, I don't know.  We invented the stoplight and the heart transplant, motherfucker.  I told you, nigga, nigga mania.  You have to have these guys.  Those fuckers tried to say not one black invention was real. 
[02:36:30]  Never.  Benjamin Bannica, eat a ass.  What?  Who's he?  What do you think?  He did the plans, the architectural plans for Washington, D.C.  Okay.  Yeah.  Supposedly.  Supposedly?  Yeah.  Well, supposedly.  According to nigger mania.  Not if you go to that website.  Oh, shit.  Fucking bazers.  And I know we don't have any room for anybody else in the studio, but can we make an exception?  He's out there looking lonely. 
[02:37:00]  What?  That big sad sack?  Yeah.  There's a seat behind me.  Pat.  Pat from Minaki, you got the big invite.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on in, sir.  Pat from Minaki.  The day before vacation.  He's happy-go-lucky.  Look at him.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Wow.  Hey.  Take a seat over there.  Take a seat.  We got a nice seat for you and everything.  What the hell?  Why not?  There you go.  Hello, Pat.  How are you?  Pat from Minaki has joined the program as well.  How you doing, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Patrice.  You sure?  Wait.  You didn't say hi to Big Jay Oakerson.  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  What's that?  You didn't say hi to Big Jay.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, Big Jay.  What's up?  Nice you guys didn't call him fat before you walked through the door.  It's on the other side of Patrice.  You do the math.  Patrice is driving for a life raft and calling me fat when you guys call him fat.  I feel so bad for Pat.  It's just like I never can really go in on me.  No, he's getting his shit together, doesn't he?  Oh, yeah.  How's the medical shit going?  A number one.  AIDS?  What?  AIDS.  AIDS number one. 
[02:38:00]  I don't mind.  My AC3 test is bad.  It's a 13.  That's a diabetic joke.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  It's a test that tests your average sugar over three months.  For your diabetes.  Do you use Liberty?  Liberty Medical Supply for my diabetes.  Fucking walrus mustache motherfucker.  I hate that Wilford Brimley commercial.  When I will need my testing supplies.  Just a grout here.  You can see the guy coming to the door.  Hi, Liberty.  Give me the box and get the fuck out of here. 
[02:38:30]  I got diabetes.  He hasn't had an erection since he did the firm.  Oh, my one is a goddamn not so firm.  You jammy still getting hard, man?  What?  You still fill up?  You jammy?  You still fill up a little?  I wish it would.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a...  It's really...  It's the worst.  What about Viagra?  She's like a two-truth detector.  I can't really learn to lie.  Can you pop the dick pills or not?  I tried samples once, but...  Not...  Yeah, I took one, nothing. 
[02:39:00]  And then it was like a pack of, like, ten or something.  You gotta be in perfect health to take those, man.  You went down every half hour.  Did you go blind?  Did you go blind?  No, I was in Blue World.  You gotta be in perfect health to take those fucking pills, man.  You gotta be careful, right?  They suggested the vacuum.  They go, hey, babe, excuse me.  Oh, that pumping?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that on TV, an infomercial.  That was on.  Yeah, that was Austin Powers.  Yeah, I was getting up.  You saw my bag, baby.  I was getting up for work, and the TV was on. 
[02:39:30]  An infomercial was on for a dick pump.  It was for a dick pump.  Wow.  And they're like, yes, this is for erectile dysfunction.  Jesus.  Yeah, my basement is flooded with dicks.  I need a dick pump.  You fucking asshole.  What a idiot.  We love him.  I wish I had a fire hose with shit in it so I can point at you after that joke and just  shit spray you against the wall.  Yeah, but I couldn't believe it.  I'm watching it going like this fucking dick. 
[02:40:00]  And this guy's here going, this really helped the sex life.  He's there like with his wife who's smiling and fucking.  Let's get the audio.  That would be great for the show.  I'm sure it's online somewhere.  Can I just say to Pat, I'm sorry that Running Man killed you.  Oh, shit.  The fucking guy that got electric.  The lights on.  The opera singer.  You should have seen my P.A.C. and G, Bill.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I think Patrice is an inherent asshole.  Like you said, you can't pick on him, and then you do anyway.  I just said that. 
[02:40:30]  But not as vicious as I want to go in it, Pat.  It's just something I just wish him happiness.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate that.  You're playing with him.  Yeah.  Like a cat is fucking smacking a mouse.  You're not going to kill him, but you're just playing with him.  You just don't want to see something.  You just don't want to see Pat go kill a bunch of bitches in a gym.  No, no, no.  No, he's going to have to do that shit.  A gym.  When I hit the gym, he won't know what fucking scene to me.  Ah, fucking gym. 
[02:41:00]  Take the wrong place.  Jesus.  He would turn into the happy-go-lucky killer, though.  You while I'm just like, you're still there in that trailer, huh?  Shit.  Yeah.  God, that thing is fucking old now.  I recently made my acting debut.  In?  In something.  It's a parody of the MTV show called Bromance.  It's called Bromos.  Bromos.  I put up a little link on Whackbag. 
[02:41:30]  I have like a 10-second scene.  Who's doing the show?  It's something called Garbage Videos.  Hot Garbage Videos.  Hot Garbage Videos.  Yeah.  It was professionally done.  What does it mean by that?  Can we see this immediately?  Yeah, we got to find it.  It was premiered in a theater.  Where's the club?  It's on Hudson Street.  It's on promos.com.  And it links you to YouTube.  All right.  We got to get someone on the computer.  We have to see this.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  So I want to see promos. 
[02:42:00]  Big K, where are you going to be?  What are we promoting?  You're the Comedy Central?  No, I'm going to be at Caroline's this month, the 26th and 27th.  One show each night.  Fine establishment.  It is a fine establishment.  Don't you have something coming out, though?  My CD.  CD, okay.  My CD came out on iTunes.  Right.  American Storyteller came out two weeks ago.  Don't mind young Danny in front of you.  This is the great room we have here now, as far as the studio goes.  Jesus.  Yeah, we got a split fucking seat between a guest, a second guest, and Danny. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, good.  Great job.  No, because they know what they're doing.  Yeah.  Don't give us any more room.  Purse the thought.  Yeah.  Why would you get a CD, Jay?  I look like Danny, except for my face is much bigger.  I look like Danny in a funny mirror.  I can't wait.  Bromos.com is wrong, Patrick.  You probably spelt it wrong.  You put promos in Google.  Promos, episode four.  There we go.  Episode four.  Episode four.  Promos, episode four.  You can go to 240. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, there it is.  Of what clip?  This one?  Yeah.  No, the top one.  Top one.  What?  That says episode four.  Which one is it, Pat?  The one?  The one where they're all standing in the guy in the banana outfit.  That's what he was doing.  That's what he was doing, Pat.  Danny wants to give your face a good slap.  Oh, boy, does he.  What clip is it, Pat?  The top one should say episode four.  No, it doesn't.  No, yeah.  He had it.  Danny had it.  Danny's got it down.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, no, it's not. 
[02:43:30]  Do you just want to smack him?  Yeah, this is going to be your worst nightmare.  My worst nightmare would be like a bad tornado to ripping buildings apart, people shreds.  This is professional.  Let me be your lover, boy.  Just want to hold your hand.  Something we might both enjoy.  I got to be your man.  Patrice is growing.  What the fuck is he doing?  Really?  Wow, thank you.  Watch it.  Or you're going to end up like your limited pal, Roger. 
[02:44:00]  Here you go, babe.  Come back next time.  What you need good looking?  Where's the clip?  Real men know how to handle their wieners.  Where the fuck are you, Pat?  Yeah, really.  Competitive hot dogs.  Sitting down over here.  Dribble.  Where's my dogs?  Where's my meat?  Could we have our names digitally taken out of this? 
[02:44:30]  By the way, because Pat's wearing a t-shirt with Opie and Anthony Wow on it.  I want that pixelated.  I'm sure I get the big plug-in.  You should sue Pat.  Yo, let's do it.  Plug in your fucking mouth and nostrils.  That video has over 800 hits already.  All right.  It's doing good.  All right.  Who's the chick?  Come on.  Pull through, buddy.  Pull through.  Come on.  Come on. 
[02:45:00]  They should have used it more.  Come on, buddy.  Who's the fraud?  Db, come on, buddy.  I don't know.  I never saw it.  I should have done that.  I'd throw her out of the way and say, let me show you how it's done.  All right.  Wait.  You're already done.  Pat's already done?  Yeah.  That was it.  Now we're just.  All right.  Let's.  This is great.  I went to Prospect Park for about an hour.  That looks horrible.  Poor Pat.  I'm just saying it.  Pat's very excited.  Your parts, whatever it was.  You're an eating guy.  You thought it was good, Pat. 
[02:45:30]  He's excited, though, guys.  I was method acting.  Thanks, Jim.  I just thought you were really relaxed with your leg up.  Poor Pat.  That was not good.  It looked like some.  Pat just.  You didn't say bad.  He just reached for something that wasn't there.  He's just turning red.  He's just like.  Is that a book?  Pat, was that an audition process?  Put an ad.  Jimmy Fart, that video's throwing off a smell, too. 
[02:46:00]  That'll do with me.  That's my body pushing out its opinion.  It was so bad.  Oh, don't be fresh.  Jimmy is really ripe today.  I can't help.  What did you eat last night?  It's my pre-vacation farts.  Whenever I get excited, my body goes crazy inside.  Anticipatory farts.  Get Sam.  We got a Bobo thing.  And Danny.  They did something pretty good with Bobo for the last week.  Killed him?  Well.  That would be pretty good.  Sam.  Bobo. 
[02:46:30]  Danny was part of this, too, right?  Of course.  What do you got going on with Bobo?  We got two quick clips to play for everybody today.  Is Bobo here?  Yeah, he's out there.  He's wearing something to offend less people today.  Let's watch him run in and run up to a microphone and just start talking like he does every fucking time.  Well.  Do we want him in?  You got a mask on.  Well.  Sam, why don't you explain to Anthony why Bobo has a shirt covering his face for the last three hours.  He's completely been blindfolded.  Yes.  Wait till you hear what's going on.  Wrong place.  Go the other way. 
[02:47:00]  Other way, Bobo.  Other way.  Lower.  Get down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit.  No, not there.  Not there.  No, no.  Okay.  Sit.  Sit.  Sit.  All right.  Right there.  Okay.  Stay.  Squatting like a big Kong.  Okay.  You twisted fuck.  Why don't you tell Anthony why Bobo was wearing a shirt over his face for the last three hours?  Last week he had the box covering him for like four or five hours.  Yeah.  So this week, as to not offend people, walking by him, sitting outside our office, he was 
[02:47:30]  told to keep the shirt draped over his whole face and head.  Oh, his face.  Okay.  I mean, you told him, not he was told.  Well.  You, Sam Roberts, the sick fuck.  I mean, advised.  Advised.  Not told.  And if people ask him why the shirt, what is he supposed to say?  He can tell you.  No, I say, because my face offends people.  Oh, fuck.  I almost want to see the face that goes with that voice.  Yeah, don't you? 
[02:48:00]  Fuck it, Sam.  And how many people has he said this to?  I mean, everybody from DJs to producers to building people, everyone who's walked by has asked him  about it and everyone has informed them.  Apparently, some people are offended by my face, so I have covered it.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  What else did you do with Bobo this week?  Well, every week, Danny, Travis, and myself call Bobo at least two or three times a day 
[02:48:30]  from the office phone, and we realized that he doesn't like being accused of lying this  week.  So what we did was we spent the week calling him at all hours of the morning and afternoon  phone, and called him a liar.  Accusing him of lying.  Yes.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you do that?  Bobo lied to me.  He does lie.  That's what I said.  No, I didn't lie to you.  You didn't lie, Bobo.  I didn't lie to you.  Bobo, you're lying right now.  You're lying right now.  You did lie to me.  No, I did not lie to Jim.  You're lying now. 
[02:49:00]  Stop lying to Jim.  That's right.  I didn't lie to Jim.  Look at Patton just staring at him like, like, Patton's like, what kind of weird porn?  It really is creepy.  All right, take the fucking thing off your head.  Yeah.  Behead him or take it off.  There you go.  Hey, you grew the mustache back.  That looks good.  Yeah, that's right.  I grew the mustache back.  Microphone.  That is such incentive for me to shave.  I really got to get rid of it.  I don't know.  For some reason, Christina requested the mustache, so if you wanted the mustache, you got the  mustache. 
[02:49:30]  Are you and her still dating?  I'm still stalking, huh?  Uh, yeah.  The answer to the question is, Fu Man Pugh.  Is she still your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Not true.  Not true.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  You're not your girlfriend, Bobo.  Why are you lying?  No, I'm not lying.  You said you're going to cut your fingernails.  That's true.  You did say that, Bobo.  What's with your fingernails?  What's wrong with the kid?  Like, where is it?  He lies all the time.  He's a chronic liar.  No, no, no, I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Why do you lie a lot?  I'm not lying.  He just lies. 
[02:50:00]  Is he Spanish?  No, he's lying.  I don't know.  He's not truthful.  Are you Spanish, though?  Yeah, no.  What is your nationality?  I don't know.  I'm mixed.  You're Spanish, Bobo.  Well, you just lied to Patrice.  I'm mixed.  He's Hmong and Gloyd.  You've got to be lying.  You're Spanish.  There's some in there.  You're just lying.  You are lying.  Well, I said I'm not entirely Spanish.  That's a lie.  This guy, he should come with dishes attached to his back 24 hours a day. 
[02:50:30]  There's nothing not Spanish about him.  You are Spanish, dude.  No.  He might have a little in you.  There's a little.  You're lying.  I lied.  No, I'm not lying.  There's a little bit.  I'm not lying.  So basically, hold on.  We've got to play this because these guys, what do you do, Sam?  After a week of calling him, I realized, oh, Jesus Christ, we should have been recording these.  So he also confessed to Danny upon questioning that he regularly comes in the toilet. 
[02:51:00]  What's her name?  What, he sent out a plunger?  Oh, I've got to let it out somewhere, so might as well let it out in the toilet.  Easy to clean.  Easy to clean.  Fuck balls, man.  What a liar.  God.  Damn, man.  So what am I playing here?  And so this would be, I think the first call is from Thursday afternoon after we had spent  the week accusing him of lying and finding out that he comes in the toilet. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah?  Hey, Bobo.  Yeah?  What's up?  Why are you lying about these errands that you ran?  What?  Why are you lying to us every goddamn day now?  No, I'm not lying to you guys.  I can hear it in your voice, Bobo.  I haven't been lying this week.  I had to go there.  What about the coming in the toilet?  What about that?  I do that on my own health.  No, you're lying, Bobo.  You don't do that. 
[02:52:00]  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  What time did you get up this morning?  I woke up at 6.  You're lying.  You're lying.  We talked to you at 5.30.  You're lying.  Well, well, well, that's when I woke up.  I woke up a little bit later.  Bobo, you're lying.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  Any time it sets for the same time, the same time starts.  Bobo, did you come in the toilet yesterday?  No, I didn't do that yesterday.  You're not lying.  You're lying.  You come in the toilet all the time.  I'm not lying.  Yeah, you're lying. 
[02:52:30]  I'm not lying.  You're lying.  I'm not lying, guys.  You're lying.  I'm not lying, guys.  You're lying.  Yeah, I'm not lying, guys.  Bobo, you are lying.  You're lying.  I'm not lying, guys.  Bobo, you're lying.  Bobo, I'm not lying.  Bobo, you're a liar because you're lying.  You're a fucking liar.  I'm not lying, guys.  You're lying!  I'm not lying.  Bobo, where are you right now? 
[02:53:00]  Bobo, it's the same.  You're a meister.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Obviously, you're lying, too, which is funny.  No, I'm not lying.  Oh, Bobo.  After that, being the grade-A producers that Travis and I are,  we realized at 4.55 this morning,  I don't remember if Bobo is coming in.  We need to call him. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, exactly.  Yes.  So at 4.55 this morning, we made the second call.  I'm about to leave there right now.  I'm about to head out there right now.  Are you sure?  Bobo.  Yeah?  Travis and me were talking, and there's a rumor going around in the office.  Were you lying about coming in today?  I'm not lying.  Then what are you leaving?  I'm about to head out right now.  You sound like you just woke up.  No, I didn't just wake up. 
[02:54:00]  I'm about to head out right now.  Yeah, you're lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I think you're lying.  No, I'm not lying.  This sounds like a total fabrication.  No, I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Around the usual time you see me arrive, you'll see me.  Watch.  You'll see.  And what time is that?  Usually around 6.30.  Maybe around 6.20.  You're never here at that time.  That's a lie.  I'm not lying.  You'll see me, all right? 
[02:54:30]  I think you're lying, Bobo.  I don't think we'll see you at all.  Bobo just hangs up.  I love it.  Wow, Bobo.  You're such a liar.  No, I'm not lying.  That's what Bobo does now.  You been to any Mets games?  I'm going to tonight's game.  Yeah, right.  You think they're going to win?  Yeah, no.  Oh, I hope so.  I'll go, Paul.  You going tonight?  What do you think of the Mets this season? 
[02:55:00]  I have a feeling a little good at it this way.  At least this year, I won't be sold playoff tickets in advance.  Yeah, you're pretty sharp there.  Yeah, because I feel like that.  Oh, they're going to make the playoffs pretty much because it's like, it seems like pretty  much they're going to make the playoffs until they just start selling a ticket at some  point in September.  And all of a sudden, I got these tickets.  They think, oh, well, maybe going to the playoffs.  I don't have to worry about that.  They may get them going.  And then all of a sudden, the last two years, I was at that last game of the season, and 
[02:55:30]  they didn't make it.  Do you realize you're making no point?  Is Bobo real?  Yeah, Jay is, actually.  Is he real?  There's no point, Bobo.  He's a Disney animatronic thing.  What were you trying to say?  Yeah, what were you trying to convey?  I was going to say, they wound up not making the playoffs.  Nobody can hear you.  Can you speak up?  You're whispering.  You're on purpose.  I'm raging.  Speak louder.  Leave this kid alone, because he has to go watch people's court at 4.30. 
[02:56:00]  His tickets are stuck in my possession, pretty much.  Stuck in your possession?  Somebody just throw it out of a box of matches to see if he can count them right away.  They're automatically refunded.  They're automatically refunded if they don't make it.  Fuck me, man.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  That's a lie.  No, they're not.  You're lying.  Yeah, they are.  No, you're lying right now, Bobo.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  Bobo, you're lying.  Yeah, that's not.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying. 
[02:56:30]  He's underdog before he changes.  He's shoeshine boy.  I'm not lying.  My sister can grab the thing in the mail that said they were automatically refunded.  No, she can.  He's humble.  You're in a mail.  She's lovable.  Shoeshine boy.  You're humble and lovable.  She can go get the evidence that they were automatically refunded.  There's no evidence.  Yeah.  Do you think he says he's lying on purpose because he likes the sound of the bell?  Yeah.  No, no, I keep, like, I kept the record. 
[02:57:00]  I kept the record of that.  No, you didn't.  No, I did.  It's still lying around somewhere.  That's lying.  That's lying.  There's no way you would use the word.  Yeah.  He's lying about being fucking Mexican.  Yeah.  He's not even Hispanic.  He just said he was.  You're lying.  No, I didn't say that.  My grandmother is from Nicaragua.  Oh, my God.  Don't drop the N-word like that.  Nicaragua?  That's Nick.  He's for water.  Nick for water for water.  Nick is running on the platform.  He's pro water. 
[02:57:30]  It's just the way it sounds when you say it.  He's from Nicaragua.  Nick for water.  Where's your grandmother from?  Nicaragua.  Now it's Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  And we all know who needs water there.  Yes, I know.  Holy shit.  Wow.  So you're part Nicaraguan.  Where's she from, your grandmother?  She's from where?  Nicaragua.  And my grandfather, her husband, my grandfather on my mother's side, is from Italy. 
[02:58:00]  But his parents, for some reason, his family migrated into the Dominican Republic.  So he grew up there.  You're fucking completely Latino.  You are, yeah, completely Mexican.  Not sure.  I don't know about that.  There's...  We know about that.  There's some European on my father's side of the family.  There's not.  What European?  Where?  Spain?  I don't know entirely.  I know there's some Polish there.  Wow, that's okay.  What I do know is my grandmother on my father's side was half Irish, half Italian. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, that I do know.  How do you know that?  He doesn't.  He makes it up.  He's lying.  No, no, I know that because I was told that.  You're lying.  But you're lying.  My mother.  No one would tell you that.  Come on.  But when no one believes you, you're lying and it's obvious.  My mother told me that.  You're lying.  How many listeners right now are just fucking committing suicide?  I know.  There's no line.  I found...  I found...  I found...  I found it out.  I looked up stuff about my relatives.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  About their history.  Oh, you did?  Would you go to that fucking...  It's not that hard.  It's not exactly a family tree.  It's incestry.com.  He's been cursed with more than Jerry Lewis's voice.  Well, they didn't have it back then.  He's been cursed with a lady voice.  They didn't have that back then when my mother looked that up.  Yeah.  When my mother looked that up.  He talks through everybody.  He just said, I'm not lying.  Incestry.com wasn't around back then. 
[02:59:30]  I found this stuff out before that.  Nothing stops him.  No, he'll just keep...  I've invented a formula that makes me...  He's the therminator.  Nothing can stop him.  Should we get Boba out of the studio?  I'm almost impressed he was able to choose a mustache style.  Yo, Christina.  What made you get the Fu Manchu?  What was the decision?  Girl.  Christina asking for it.  Oh, you got a girlfriend? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, she asked for it.  She's got great big tits, too.  Is she cute?  Yeah, she is.  Big fucking tits.  Nice Italian chick from Brooklyn.  How many times do you sleep with her a week?  I haven't slept with her yet.  I don't know why she's freaking busy every single weekend.  Yeah, well...  That's why.  She's playing...  I'm going to eat your pussy.  I want to look at it like it's a bowl of lead pen chips.  I'm going to eat your vagina?  Everything's in question. 
[03:00:30]  Can I eat you?  Can we see the picture of her that came with the frame?  Are you...  Hey, he's fucking...  He's fucking...  He's fucking the Macy's regular...  The picture that comes with the Macy's...  No, but I got this picture on my phone.  I see this one.  Are you mad that Danny fucked her?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  He wasn't supposed to know that.  She's fucking ultra cute.  What's the picture?  She's super cute.  Jimmy...  She's very sexy.  He wasn't supposed to know that.  Don't get the phone in the toilet.  Oh, you're kidding.  You slept with my Brooklyn mistress. 
[03:01:00]  Danny.  Not me.  Sorry, Bobo.  Danny.  Everybody knows that.  I didn't want you to find out like this.  Shit.  Oh, you're kidding.  You did.  He dog fucked her.  Oh, no.  Don't do that to him, man.  Don't do that to him, Joe.  What?  Tell us.  You did.  He dog fucked her?  Yeah, he fucked her brutally.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  When you fucked her from behind, did you step on her face with your feet?  Is there any evidence of it around?  No, Bobo.  Just in her hair.  No.  Just buy a blue light from Radio Shag and put it on her face and see what it spells Danny 
[03:01:30]  like a fucking magician's trick.  Patrice, I believe if he's not looking at you, he can't hear you.  I didn't.  Yeah.  He can't hear us with his eyes.  He's like an alien.  Why'd you do that, Danny, man?  I didn't mean to set up Bobo new.  No, Jim.  She was giving me some pretty strong signals.  She said Bobo was ignoring her and then she was just like, oh, what?  This could break his heart, man.  Of course, the thing is, I can't tell if she was yelling mining.  During it.  My little shotgun. 
[03:02:00]  Hey.  Oh, no.  This is terrible.  How do you feel?  I feel horrible.  Empty inside?  Yeah.  You're horrible.  But she hasn't.  You haven't fucked her yet, though.  Yeah.  He's a big dick.  Why don't you just give it to her?  At some point, he's got to get it.  I got to get it.  Don't unleash him on her, man.  Just relax.  You see Bobo's penis?  I agree.  He's packing some wood? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  You're packing amazing wood, Bobo?  Fuck yes, he is.  Here go the curtains.  No, no, no.  The curtains are being pulled.  What are you packing in, Bobo?  You might want to leave.  No, no, no.  I'll take a look at his doofy dick.  Doofy dick.  So what?  And know what happens?  All right, Bobo.  Are you killing it, Bobo?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Patrice.  Go ahead, Bobo.  Hold on, but I want to let Patrice on some.  Patrice, you start talking like erotic. 
[03:03:00]  And it'll get hard instantly.  And then you talk about the mess, and who'll lose to Hard On.  Patrice, if you take part in it, I'll never come to your barbecue again.  Take it down.  Take it down.  I'm not even going to show this that way.  Are there any women around?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, drop it down.  Drop it down.  There's women's shirt.  Don't do this thing.  On those fancy underpants, though.  No, no, drop it down.  I'm talking again.  Oh, you guys are going for the misdirection. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, the thing is this.  See, now.  See, Patrice is covered in sacks.  You have to watch it jump.  It's like, the bottom line is this.  Christina and her big tits.  You have to get her into a hotel room sooner or later.  Yeah.  You know those big, luscious tits.  You want to just put soap on them in the shower.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Show up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then that's right.  Yeah, but it feels awkward.  It looks like your dick all had a stroke.  Yeah, this feels awkward.  No, I was. 
[03:04:00]  And the thing is, the problem is,  you can take it to a Mets game.  The fucking Mets are just terrible, dude.  Why are they so awful?  This is your players this year.  But they can't win a fucking game.  Look, it's already won.  Why can't they win a game?  It's embarrassing.  I have no idea.  Is this a new bit that I got to talk pantsless now?  No, forget pantsless. 
[03:04:30]  Why are the Mets losing?  Jesus.  We finally shut up.  Why are the Mets losing, Bobo?  I said this.  Players injured a lot of key players.  Yeah, but they got a brand new field.  They're supposed to be good.  They could be good.  But now with these key players that we had,  and we had that are hurt.  They're supposed to be good players,  and all of a sudden,  the fucking whole team is going to build a new stadium,  and they're losing.  Why?  That's what happened.  Our better players are hurt.  But there's no reason for the whole franchise 
[03:05:00]  to be suffering like that.  Mix it up nice.  Yeah.  Right?  Oh, we'll get better next year.  It's probably the pitch coach.  The pitch coach.  All right, here we go.  We got to go.  The pitching coach is no good.  Would you take Christine to a Mets game?  I would.  I'd take her,  and of course I'd go with her to a Yankee game.  Do you think that she'd want to take you to a motel after?  Oh, man.  Well, yeah, of course.  I'm thinking that she'd slide those little thong panties off, too,  if you took her to a motel.  Yeah, but you know what I might do  to get her the next time I'm at the Stress Factory? 
[03:05:30]  I might get her one of those,  I think it says you can take me to the Stress Factory  after you've finished me off.  Oh, it's the fucking patient waiting is up on his phone.  I don't know.  Oh, my God! 
[03:06:00]  He's trying.  But Jesus fucking's trying.  He's leaving us for you.  I had no idea.  I had to...  I don't know.  The whole time this...  I get your point.  I don't know.  The whole time you got...  There was tears.  I don't know.  Pat's like fading left away from tears.  Your voices was freaking stuck in my head the day I went to see the urologist a week ago.  Patrice was crying. 
[03:06:30]  He was crying.  He had tears coming down his fucking face.  I know.  A-Rod.  I think he was watching a dog-crushing video.  A-Rod.  I'm sick of seeing him on the front page of every single paper.  A-Rod.  Is this the sports section or page six?  Bobo, when you retell the story, tell them that your dick was so big and a black man crying.  It seems like a new thing.  Who is A-Rod sleeping with?  Well, the thing is...  It seems that they're doing the thing.  Who is A-Rod sleeping with?  The thing is, A-Rod has been nothing but a bust. 
[03:07:00]  I want to get it totally bad.  It has been nothing but a bust.  The guy just can't get a hit in a big situation.  And the Mets just seem to have that problem, too, right now.  Yeah, I know.  We got a lot of injured players that have been...  It's fucking terrible.  It's inexcusable.  I know.  It's horrible, that team.  But all I can tell you is this crap happened.  The Yankees are doing very well this season, huh?  Yeah, but we all know A-Rod's going to be batting...  Here it goes.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter, though.  It doesn't matter, though. 
[03:07:30]  At this point, we're, what, five and a half games up?  Did they win?  I don't know.  I think they did.  It's awful again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys speak to me at the end of October, then tell me how the Yankees did.  The thing is this, though.  Guys like that are the ones that always get the girls.  And here you are.  You're into Christina.  And you're starting to have problems, like, getting with this chicken.  It's like, what?  You know that if you got her alone, like, if she would just trust you to get her alone,  dude, you could get that bra off.  Oh, man.  And those big, giant tits would come out.  I sometimes wonder if she's going to be... 
[03:08:00]  If she's going to be...  I bet she has big nipples, man.  If you got her shirt off, those big nipples...  Well, yeah, of course, of course she does.  Those big, juicy nipples would probably be really fun to soap up and pinch a little bit.  Yeah.  And you could probably put your dick between them.  Oh, wow.  From what I can tell, you could one-quarter tit-fuck them.  Would you tit-fuck her, though, if you could?  Yeah, I would.  I would.  I would.  I would.  I would.  Show us on Pat.  There it is.  There it is. 
[03:08:30]  There it is.  This is the fucking...  I'm telling you, I have to sit home and wonder what...  This has to rank in the top five most unbelievable things.  I've never seen anything like this.  Fuck!  I'm just...  What the fuck, right?  It's raging. 
[03:09:00]  Well, you like her, though.  You can't help it.  Well, you want to fuck her, man.  I can't laugh no more.  I think I've seen a nail.  Well, it's good to know.  I've been saying the same reason about how...  Why the heck do I need a pill for impotence?  I don't need a pill for impotence.  No shit.  You know who needs a fucking pill, bro?  Fucking please.  Oh, Jimmy.  Take your headphones off.  Yeah, because you don't ask something. 
[03:09:30]  What?  Bongo.  Bongo the Drucker says,  I'm talking sex to see if it stays on.  Okay.  I'll wait until it goes to where it was before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the problem...  I need to put your headphones on.  Yeah, put your headphones on.  Bongo, not you.  I'm going to get it down again.  Good job, Bongo.  Okay, I will.  Oh, my God.  Here's the key.  The problem with the organization is that nobody is stepping up and taking charge, and  as a result, the entire franchise is suffering. 
[03:10:00]  And all the farm system picks they're supposed to have, they're not going to get because they  have higher picks and they're blowing it.  We understand they have injuries and stuff, but there should be somebody to bring up to  back that up, but they don't have anybody.  Well, I guess the best ones are the ones that are not ready yet.  Yeah, but is it better to just fucking lose every game, or should they just bring somebody  up that could maybe help out a little bit?  Well, I have a feeling at some point they're going to bring someone up, but there still  is a lot of guys that they don't want to rush.  Why? 
[03:10:30]  But look at the situation they're in.  You've got to rush it.  They're really losing.  I mean, this is awful to watch.  Like Willie Randolph, they threw to the Wolves because they had a few bad games, and they  dump him, and they humiliate him, which was just stupid.  It's like, they're not doing any better now.  How about getting Willie Randolph back?  Yeah, I guess they could try that.  Yeah, but they had him, and they lost him, and now they can't do it, but they blame the  wrong dude.  Yeah, they do. 
[03:11:00]  Well, they're going to bring somebody up and have a feel...  They're going to...  And go.  And go.  See, the thing is this.  Willie Randolph was a great Yankees second baseman.  He was a great player.  I remember back in the...  Remember all those allegations of him and Bucky Dent were hanging out in the showers afterwards?  And they said that Bucky...  There was apparently Reggie Jackson saw this, but Bucky Dent would got caught sucking Willie  Randolph's dick a few times.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  Like, they said that he would cup his dick in balls. 
[03:11:30]  I wasn't even alive in the 70s.  But they said that he would suck Willie Randolph's dick, and he would lick the bottom of it,  and he'd cup the balls, and he would finger his butt.  I didn't even hear this, but this is a bit crazy.  I know there's some crazy stuff going in the Bronx, but I think my eyes are burning in  the Bronx would be a way to describe that.  So if you had to have sex with a man, who would it be?  Yeah.  Not that you want to, but if you had to.  Like, if you had to pick some guy who was going to say, put it in your butt for a few minutes. 
[03:12:00]  Brad Pitt's delish.  I'd guess it'd be probably the one that'd be craziest.  Yeah.  It'd be Bob Kelly.  Would you let Bob Kelly kiss you?  Oh, thank God.  Would you let Bob Kelly kiss you?  I'm just knowing that makes me happy.  Bob Kelly has big, juicy kissable lips.  Would you let him give you a kiss on the neck?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Would you like to?  Would you let Bob Kelly kiss your stomach?  Because Bob has big, soft lips.  Yeah.  He would kiss your stomach all the way down.  And what about his ass?  Bob slimmed down. 
[03:12:30]  He's probably got a nice, smooth ass.  And he could slip it deep in his asshole.  Yeah, Bob has a really nice, hairless butt.  And Bob likes it when a guy puts his dick in there.  He kind of grips it with his ass.  Yeah.  And kind of tugs it.  You could feel him, like, pulling with your ass.  Get a reach around on his Vespa.  It just feels so creepy.  It might, but it would feel really good, because Bob's lips are really soft.  Yeah, but the whole sound of it is creepy.  I probably, the only way that would happen, if I, I must have been hammered on some crazy 
[03:13:00]  drug to do that.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I'll say that.  Nothing.  Definitely straight.  Definitely straight.  Oh, pass the test.  Did you ever see a video, I saw a really cool video, of that really hot chick with the  dog licking her pussy?  Oh, shit.  Did you ever see that?  Oh, she was like, she was naked, and the dog, she had peanut butter on her pussy, and  the German Shepherd ran in and just started lapping at it, and he was like, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Amazing.  And then he was lapping it, and she turned over on her stomach, and the dog jumped up on  top of her, and I can't believe it's happening again, and he jumped on her. 
[03:13:30]  That was like my sister's dog.  Yeah, yeah, and it's getting hard.  I'm telling you, I'm walking that dog, people want to look at that dog.  Wow, wait, not much to age.  I'm telling you, I think, I think in this case, I think, I think that dog, I think, I think  my sister's dog, Rosie, I think there might be some, uh, there might be some inter-species,  there might be some inter-species lesbianism going on. 
[03:14:00]  Hey.  In all fairness, that got me hard, too.  Oh, Bubba, you're great.  I wouldn't be surprised at that with the way people look, the way women love this dog.  All right, my sister's dog, I swear, they, they, they want to pet this dog.  They want to pet the dog.  Every time, it's like, oh, can I pet the dog?  Can I pet it?  Please, can I pet it?  Yeah, but you know what a dog really likes? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  A dog really likes to get behind a girl, and, and look at that, they hump away.  A dog loves to hump away on a girl, and they'll, and they'll hump anything, so I can't really  say anything.  They'll hump anything.  They sure will.  Anything with peanut butter or any kind of food, they'll hump it.  Well, I don't think he needs any peanut butter there.  That dog knows exactly what to do.  Yeah, he sure does.  Don't talk to her and stick it in.  That's it.  Well, that dog smells something, all right?  They don't know anything.  Their brains are so small. 
[03:15:00]  Wow.  Believe me, we understand that.  Wow.  Probably more than you know.  And just probably just smart enough to do some crazy trick.  Unbelievable.  How, how, how does she?  This is just terrible.  This is just carving away.  I'm a piece of garbage, but this is still, this has to be the weirdest rule on planet Earth  right now.  There's nothing going on worse than what's going on.  Damn, that's one more fucking rule.  With this motherfucker and his magic powers. 
[03:15:30]  These are magic powers, by the way.  Patrice.  He has powers.  Patrice, as a black man sitting through that whole thing, you should be credited one free  fag bash in the street.  Dude, let me tell you something.  This is shocking.  It really is.  That's a horny dog.  Those things like Patrice.  Dude, just get him out of here, could you?  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're done there, Bobo. 
[03:16:00]  Good job, Bobo.  This was on.  I'm fucking losing.  I know I've lost.  You lost a little bit of your soul.  I need some vitamins.  I lost a day or two on your life.  On my life.  By the way, top one, one of my favorites.  I got it.  I got it.  Don't say it.  No, I know.  Right there.  By the way, sorry about that eyesore, Drew Boogie.  Sorry about that eyesore, Drew Boogie.  You said that, and I was going to ask if you got a copy of that remix CD around.  Oh, I know.  The train that is his voice.  That is just so, thank you.  Get back.  Bizarre, isn't it? 
[03:16:30]  What was it you said?  I don't even have to, you know, I wish I had a better vocabulary to just explain what  I'm feeling.  Yeah, it's like a piece of your soul has left you.  Question.  A piece of goodness.  Question.  Please tell me how one, there's a lot of things that happen.  One, how did we get his pants to be down?  What was the fucking, how did that happen?  Take them down.  I mean, before, I mean, but why, why was he, why did you ask, why was he notified? 
[03:17:00]  Secondly, what happened for it to rock it up in that way and then go down?  How did you find out the fucking designs?  I think they found out while the pants were up one day, that when, when he talked about  certain girls and stuff, it would make a pup tent and then it would go away and then  make a pup tent.  Christina, right?  Yeah.  Bubba was wearing khakis.  Clean Turner voice.  Well, it's something that puts an image in my head.  Like Christina? 
[03:17:30]  Christina looks really good in like a summer dress because she has big, heavy breasts.  Yeah, I think, I think I saw a picture of her.  It was mostly a headshot, but I could see like part of a summer dress she was wearing.  So disturbing.  It was some, some picture.  And it looks disturbing.  It looks like a hornless goat.  Yeah, it just looks like a nurse shark.  It's just so horrible looking, man.  It looked worse with more hair.  Your dick had hair on it?  Yeah, it had a lot of hair. 
[03:18:00]  Like the dick, not the hump?  A bush.  No, no.  So the surrounding area had a lot of hair.  Fucking scary.  Scary dude.  As a matter of fact, I'm shaving it off now.  And when they're there, when I got enough.  This fucking guy.  And somehow when they figure out.  If he was in porno, dude.  Like.  Yeah.  It, it raged.  And then it went down.  Yeah.  Then it raged.  Full of blood.  He's a healthy boy.  In a room full of dudes.  Guys.  But.  That's the old hair. 
[03:18:30]  That's the old hair.  Not one movement when he was talking about kissing Bobby Kelly.  Yeah, yeah.  Why was the hole in the bottom like a stingray mouth?  You gotta get, you gotta get Pat from Wynaki's reaction.  Because he was getting very depressed.  He's had.  Because that fucking, you know.  Nobody likes to show off, Bobo.  Because you mentioned earlier that.  Yeah.  A little dysfunction.  That's why Pat's not saying much.  Because he's like, fuck, don't feel bad, all right? 
[03:19:00]  For a while.  There's no function.  He's screaming into thin air, Bobo.  For a while, I thought I was going to have dysfunction at a young age.  Around the time Viagra came out.  Oh, look at his arrogance.  I thought that because of my operations.  Louder, please.  How many operations did you have on your penis?  48 operations.  Bobo, speak up.  No one can hear you.  48 operations had to do with my.  Bobo.  What?  48 operations had to do with.  Talk into the mic, please.  No one can hear you out there.  I said 48 operations has to do with my urinary system. 
[03:19:30]  What?  Dude, there's something wrong with the mic.  Just shout a little bit because we can't hear you.  It had to do with my urinary system.  They messed up.  They messed up my urinary system when I was very young.  There was a urinary system problem I was born with.  Where did you find this motherfucker, man?  He's just an intern?  He just fucking said, I want to work?  No, no, he's not an intern.  He was a guy that showed up on the bench one day when we had live audience.  Yeah.  And ever since, he's just here with his not hard, hard day. 
[03:20:00]  He comes every Friday.  This is horrifying, man.  He's collecting shopping carts from a Kmart parking lot.  Jeremy Piven is, what, 40 minutes late?  Okay.  No, I was doing moving jobs.  Bye-bye.  I was doing moving jobs.  Moving jobs?  Yeah.  Moving jobs.  Moving storage.  Loading a truck and unloading it.  Yeah.  We know what moving is.  This is in my mind.  Actually, what do you mean moving? 
[03:20:30]  What does that mean?  How do you move something?  No, just load the boxes.  Carry them.  What do you do?  There's no homeowner?  No, you leave them in the truck and you unload them.  And sometimes load them into storage containers.  Containers?  My sister's daughter, he also has storage.  Moving storage.  And he does power washing.  What are you talking about?  We're trying to entertain people.  Yeah, you're going through a power washing dissertation.  Who cares? 
[03:21:00]  This fucking guy, man.  He's fucking awful.  We've got to start wrapping up for the presentation.  Yeah, let's get shots out.  What are you plugging, Bobbo?  Oh, I am going to be at...  A very small leak for his penis.  I am going to be at the Met Games, so any fans that see me...  You're plugging me, you're going to be...  Oh, okay.  So any fans that see me, be on the lookout for Bobbo's sighting.  How?  You're on the radio, Bobbo.  And if any of you want to see his cock, just ask.  Well...  I'm not going to do that, buddy. 
[03:21:30]  Suggest it lightly.  So are you going to walk with a bullhorn and like a Jerry Lewis CD and just...  No.  With a Bobbo shirt?  How are you people going to know your Bobbo?  Right.  They'll know who I am.  If they've seen my picture on Opie's Twitter or anywhere else that my pictures appeared on,  any other sites, any other fan sites, wherever that my pictures appeared on, they'll see me.  You're an odd bird.  And that evil baby thumb you call a dick.  You have aspirations to make it... 
[03:22:00]  How big is it now?  That haunted baby thumb.  How big is it?  It's about like...  I think like three inches.  How big do you want it to go to?  Well, I'm hoping to get it to five after enlargement pills.  That's not what you said.  Yeah, I said that.  I'm trying to get it.  I'm trying to take enlargement pills to get it to...  Actually, maybe I'll get it to eight.  Go for a little bigger.  Eight inches?  You think you could do that with pills?  If it's ones that I know for sure for maybe someone who's taken them work... 
[03:22:30]  I feel like I'm crying.  I don't...  I'm going to go home and just fucking take...  A part of me is secretly hoping these pills exist.  I'm going to...  According to Christina, she claims that she knows the pills that work that work.  Oh, there's a fetal position shower coming from me.  I don't know fucking why.  Those pills are called ecstasy, then you look in a mirror.  She's trying to use enlargement pills that work.  I have no idea which one she's talking about, but whatever one she's working, I'll... 
[03:23:00]  All right.  We can do a bit actually.  She's screaming.  I'm yelling down.  Did she have a giant clit to prove it?  Lower.  Lower.  Oh, I have no idea how she knows...  Jesus, dude, she's yelling.  It's too loud.  I have no idea how she knows it works.  Bobo!  That's too loud.  The mics pick up everything.  Everything.  Speak softly.  I have no idea how she knows it works, but I guess maybe she'll...  I guess maybe she would know.  He's the greatest.  All right, Bobo.  Good boy, Bobo.  Have fun at the Mets game.  Have fun. 
[03:23:30]  See you later, Bobo.  Anybody else want to say hi?  Yeah.  Was there a girl outside who wanted to say hi?  Oh, bring her in.  Does Bobo have a handler or is he just like roam free in the world like that?  I think Sam's his handler at this point.  Sam's his manager.  Sam's a sick fuck.  Without question, man.  Oh, that Bob...  I'm just bothered by that.  Oh, look who it is.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Jamie.  They told me not to come in.  Oh, I said...  Why?  Do you don't know who this girl is?  No.  Aunt's new girlfriend.  It's not my girlfriend.  Oh.  I'm like, where is he on air later? 
[03:24:00]  Aunt's dinner.  So, hi.  Do you work here?  How's everybody doing?  Hi, Jamie.  This is incredibly intimidating.  Hi, do you work here?  We haven't met.  Are you working today?  We haven't met yet?  That's Jimmy Norton.  I'm an intern for Kavino and Rich on Maxim Radio.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Hi.  How are you?  He just gave up his post.  Yeah, no, everybody made me incredibly nervous when I walked out.  I had my bagel and I was all, like, happy.  So, you are...  Kavino and Rich are smart.  We have...  We get David and these lunkheads out here.  I know.  Look at Kavino and Rich are smarter than we are. 
[03:24:30]  I know.  Dummies.  Well, I'm actually Steve's cousin, so...  Which Steve?  Kavino.  Oh, okay, okay.  I'm not thinking of Kavino.  I forget.  Is she a Mets fan, Jim?  I don't think it'll trickle work.  Yeah.  She's getting a bubble in here.  Are you going to see Brad Pitt in Inglourious Massage?  Hey, you like baseball?  Watching bubble and un-bubble?  We actually did meet, I think, now that I know that you're coming.  Hi.  How are you?  That's Pat from Menachie.  His dick doesn't get hard.  His erection problem.  How do you guys know? 
[03:25:00]  He just told us.  Might as well tell you.  He's very sad.  He's sad about it.  Are you busy this weekend, Jamie?  Not particularly, no.  No?  No.  I'm supposed to go out on my friend's boat on Saturday night.  Yeah.  And that's it.  Oh, that's it.  Is your friend a man?  Why do you look so, like...  No, I was just trying to figure out a day.  Okay.  We can go out.  Well, I got a new BlackBerry, so I don't have anyone's phone number anymore.  Everyone thinks I've neglected them now for the past week. 
[03:25:30]  Do you have the same number?  Week.  I have the same number.  Oh.  Then I'll just...  I'll give it out.  No.  I'll just call...  No, I'll just call...  Everybody ready?  I'll just call you, and then you'll have my number.  How was your party?  Oh, boy.  It was good.  Oh, boy.  That was a side step.  Yeah?  It was good.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  So who's your friend with the boat, if you don't mind me asking?  Oh, it's...  I know.  I'm like, so, how are you?  Oh, how was the party?  That was not good.  Yeah, it was good, but, you know, somebody was missing, but...  I know.  I had a...  Why didn't you go to Anthony's party? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  I had some issues.  Were they bad issues?  Yeah.  Okay.  They work out okay.  But it's going better now.  Personal family matters.  All right.  It happens.  It wasn't that you weren't interested.  No.  He has a great place.  He's awesome.  Yes, he is.  Thanks.  And I actually...  I looked online, because I was just looking online to see where you lived.  I was just getting directions, and I saw your house from, like, a bird's eye view.  Oh, yeah.  And I was like, whoa!  Yay!  Wait till you see the inside.  Yeah.  Very nice.  I'm sure.  His house is easy to find. 
[03:26:30]  He had to register when he moved into the neighborhood, as required by law.  And the above...  The satellite picture doesn't show the backyard, because it's an old picture, and, you know,  the pool is in there and everything.  It's like 90 degrees.  So you've seen the satellite picture, then?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's an old one.  It's even better than that picture.  It's like an old one.  Yeah.  Yeah, now it's just crazy.  It's cool from the satellite.  You can see the pool is shaped like a swastika.  You can't actually see that.  Oh, that's terrible.  What about Sunday?  Sunday might be good.  It's a holy day, though. 
[03:27:00]  You're not religious, are you?  No, I'm just kidding.  No, I'm not religious.  I was just trying to freak you out.  Yeah, that's never a good sign.  No, no.  Not really religious.  Yeah, holy day like that.  You never get laid when a girl comes over with Ash Wednesday stuff on her forehead.  Nothing.  Okay.  So if I call you Sunday, maybe we could get something to eat on Sunday.  Yeah, I live so far away from you.  That's the problem.  I'm like a Jersey Shore girl.  I'll send a helicopter.  Yeah, just send your helicopter over.  Pat will pick you up in the van. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, Pat will deliver you.  I just need some help with the sofa.  Yeah, no, that'll be funny.  All right.  I'm not, you know, crazy or anything.  I don't think you are.  You know, these guys have me pegged as a lunatic or anything.  No, I'm not.  Not us.  I know.  We'd have a good time.  I know we would.  Maybe Sam a little bit.  What?  No.  What?  He's my fave.  Sam?  Yeah.  He's everybody's favorite.  He's my fave.  But he's a flaming homosexual.  Yes. 
[03:28:00]  And he's already got a girlfriend that he's engaged to.  Are you really?  Jesus.  Yeah, engaged and I'm gay, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to say, how do those things work?  He's got a little of both.  Yeah.  It's a little of both.  Yes.  Would I blow up your spot with the girlfriend thing?  Sorry.  No, no, no.  Gee, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really sorry I did that.  By the way, everybody, every guy here has a girlfriend.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  Shut up.  I'm completely single.  I don't care.  My girlfriend's dead. 
[03:28:30]  When did that happen, Jimmy?  This week.  I thought you were going to say, about an hour ago to go.  Yeah.  Well, everybody here has a girlfriend or wants to make it seem like they don't have a girlfriend.  No, Anthony does not.  You know, but they really do.  Anthony does not have a girlfriend.  No, no.  Anthony is totally single.  What do you think?  Useless.  What are the chances?  I don't know.  We'll go out.  It's one in a million in SiriusXM.  So.  No, we'll go out. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would like to.  Hey, we got to be nice.  Yeah.  Girls got to eat.  Right.  Why not eat with a cool, you know.  Thanks.  Cool radio guy.  Exactly.  Like yourself.  And why not eat with an attractive intern such as yourself?  Yeah.  God, I wish.  I just wish I could know what it was like to have a vagina just to.  Just to not have to have any, just an intern come on in and talk to a fucking millionaire 
[03:29:30]  with a mansion and say, hey, fuck balls.  I live in Jersey Shore.  Maybe I can make it to your mansion tomorrow or not.  Don't know.  Talk to you tomorrow, stupid.  It's shocking.  And no offense.  It's not that it's personal to you.  It's just all beautiful and can just come in here.  I know.  With the confidence of a vagina.  It's at least four and a half winners in here.  And she's just the confidence.  It's amazing.  It really is. 
[03:30:00]  Vaginas are fucking amazing, man.  It is.  It changed the whole mood of the room.  Five minutes ago, we were coaxing a boner out of a head.  I know.  Yeah.  It's just unbelievable.  I'm just absorbing this.  I just realized I'm living in Jersey.  I'm not going to make it to Long Island, asshole.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  And you're like, I just dug a pool, 90 degrees.  You had that stupid 90 degrees.  I might send a helicopter for you.  I don't know.  Maybe.  That's fine.  I'm doing mani-pedi.  I'm kind of busy.  I think Sam was probably saying bad things about me or something. 
[03:30:30]  I would never say anything about me.  You think he was clock blocking you a little bit?  I was suspecting that Sam is probably saying things like, oh, what, you're supposed to go out with Anthony?  Yeah, well, let me tell you about it.  No, you're a conniving little fuck sometimes.  The AIDS.  Did you hear about the AIDS?  Oh, no, no.  He fucks a lot of girls.  He treats them like shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I have audio.  No, no.  I'll get it.  Yeah.  Sam's a conniving little fucker.  I would never get in the way of your good times. 
[03:31:00]  Shut up.  Never.  Good times.  I think it's going well.  Because I was saying nothing but going out actually for lunch or dinner or anything.  I think he was fucking blocking you?  Yeah, I think he was trying to bad-mouthing me a little bit.  I would have nothing bad to say about you.  Did Sam say anything about me?  No, he didn't.  And actually, E-Rock says all good things about you.  E-Rock says all good things about E-Rock in here.  E-Rock's being phony about it, though.  E-Rock's the other one.  Because the day that I came in, I said, is he really going to call me or is this just for the show? 
[03:31:30]  He goes, no, no, he's really going to call you.  And he's this really great guy.  And he's got a really great house and all this.  Do you remember?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Look at that.  Thank you, sir.  E-Rock, you said all that?  Thanks.  E-Rock, why did you bring this in, by the way?  What is it?  Because Steve told me to run this into.  What did he tell you to run in?  Oh, that.  And we felt that she may want to demonstrate the new ONA female shirts.  Really?  Oh, God.  Extra small.  Would you demonstrate the new female shirts?  Oh, that's kind of cute.  Oh, that is really cute. 
[03:32:00]  For you, from Anthony.  Oh.  Oh, from Anthony, too.  My first gift.  How cute.  Anthony's a very generous guy.  I really actually like it.  I am very generous as far as the shirts go like that, yeah.  You know who you've got to watch out for blocking?  The other Covino and Rich intern.  The guy intern.  Oh, yeah.  He stares out this window when she's in here.  He's very jealous of her.  I'm telling you.  Why?  Creep.  Because he wants to be on the radio so bad, but she just came in here.  Tell me to get some tits.  He is on the radio, actually.  He has his own show.  It's not a real show, though. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, that's not true.  Yes, it is.  It's not.  It's really not.  What's the show on a real show?  It's the Mark Zito show on college radio.  It's on the same team.  No.  I've been holding back.  Jimmy, don't.  Hold that in.  Jimmy.  Hold that in.  I've been holding back.  Don't you stink this for a while.  I know you're getting excited about vacation, but.  I know.  Just wait a few more minutes.  I just texted you, by the way.  Oh, you did?  So you'll have my number again.  Just wait a few more minutes, Jimmy.  There we go.  Yeah, Blackberry.  Jimmy, just wait.  Just have.  I just turned over, Jimmy. 
[03:33:00]  So I have to model this shirt for you guys?  If you would, yeah.  Well, where's the changing room?  You're in it.  Right here.  We'll all turn around.  Turn around for five seconds.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm not going to put him on.  You guys get too much action in here, as it is.  I have to be a little different.  I have to be different.  You should have really seen what happened earlier.  There's just 30 queers in a room.  No action.  We're wrong.  It is really cute, but I like it.  Oh, good.  So would you let Anthony at least take you to dinner? 
[03:33:30]  He's a gentleman.  People don't think he's going to be a gentleman.  We've already talked.  I mean, it's not like we haven't spoken or anything like that.  She lost her Blackberry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, I actually just got a Blackberry, but I lost my phone.  What happened?  I don't know.  It just went somewhere into the abyss of my house.  You should just be like, Saturday, 8 p.m.  She's got a boat ride.  Two stomps for no, one for yes.  I'm nervous about this boat ride, though, because I don't really know what kind of deal this is. 
[03:34:00]  No, you have to feel out situations as a female.  Oh, that's crazy, then.  You don't want to just come over the house.  The 10th Annual Rapids Sea and Strabaganza.  Tale of 2009.  It's called Rapey Boat.  Yeah.  The Rape Boat.  You don't want to go on a boat.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's an island with David Copperfield.  The Amistad.  The worst is when you have to match up the guy to girl when you're on the boat.  Oh, shit.  Like my friend, my girlfriend, she's like, well, we'll go. 
[03:34:30]  We'll go out on Saturday, and it's my boyfriend's friend's boat, and I'm like, well, how many  girls and how many guys?  Because that always means match up.  Do you know what you sound like, I'm telling you, every year is like the teacher from Charlie  Brown.  They're just hoping you just fucking pass out and your drawers pop off.  They're just like, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Everybody's like, really?  Oh, my God.  The boat ride.  Go.  Keep going.  Huh?  Like, I just want to know.  Like, you ever see Mr. Limpet turn into the fish?  And you just, I want to know what it's like to be, like, a, what are you, five, six, five, 
[03:35:00]  five, two.  I'm about five, two.  Five, two.  I'm a tiny thing.  95 pounds of, like, every white man's dream just to walk around.  What is it like?  Do you ever have a conversation where you just go, this guy's really listening to me?  I like him.  Yeah, but not very often.  Not often, right?  No.  Well, how do you feel about that?  How does that fucking feel?  When a guy really wants to listen to me?  Just that you're 99.9% objectified.  Oh, oh, God.  I mean, I have days where I go home crying. 
[03:35:30]  Like, why are you going to learn to talk?  All you have to do is go home.  I go home sometimes.  I guarantee if she grunted, she could get dick.  Just, dick!  Just with a hump like the I Am Legend monsters and just limp around.  Neh!  Hey, you want to come to my house?  Neh!  Jersey!  Um, how does it feel like you just can't turn guys off?  You just can't.  I can, I'm sure.  Well, once they know you're not going to give them pussy, but if you're going to give them, 
[03:36:00]  you can't turn them off.  It's just...  I'll tell you how she could turn Anthony off.  This is Patrice, my boyfriend.  Turn Anthony off.  If you found out she slept with black guys, that would fuck you over?  Mentally?  Have you ever been with a black guy?  Never.  No.  Yeah.  This, this bitch is pure.  This, she's cleaner than snow.  The snow, she's cloud white.  Jesus. 
[03:36:30]  I had a black boyfriend in like 10th grade.  Yeah, they took their shirts in.  Well, I guess it's time to start a vacation, huh?  Yeah.  Black guys don't fucking date without fucking, so she's fucked a black guy before.  I think that's why it didn't work out.  Okay, she didn't get enough.  We lasted about a week.  Yeah, she's super white.  She didn't, she didn't date.  But she, she's fucked, um, Sicilians in the least, like guys that were kind of black.  You know, she doesn't even go exotic.  She, she's pure white boy.  No, I am actually.  I am.  I am.  Steve Cavino's my cousin. 
[03:37:00]  Who's that?  He's a, he's a host of the, um, Cavino and Rich show.  Is that the guy with the painted toenails guy?  No, no, no.  Oh, my, my mom.  I'm, I have, I have actually Mexican in me.  No, not, not you.  Oh, oh, you're not talking about.  Who you date.  Oh, I thought you meant like I was all just pure white girl.  No, not pure white girl.  No, your attitude is pure white girl.  But have you, have you never fucked up like outside?  You haven't even fucked up Puerto Rican.  No, I was, I was trying to pass off that I was a virgin actually amongst everybody to  see if everyone would believe me. 
[03:37:30]  And then, uh, Mark Zito goes on the show yesterday on the blog and writes that he saw a video  of me having sex on my, on my camera.  Is that true?  Is it true?  On my digital camera.  No, no.  I told him I had one on there and I erased it.  I don't believe she's a virgin though.  There's no fucking way.  That he saw it.  Too, too many hard hitting winners go after her.  Cause she's like high level white girl.  Yeah.  So, so she's gave it up.  I'm very picky though.  What's the, what's, what's the one time you fucked and you looked at yourself in the mirror  and was like, did you ever have to walk a shame where you, you've had to walk a shame? 
[03:38:00]  Oh yeah.  Hey man, she's a good girl.  I had, oh yeah.  Lots of times.  And, and has it been a time when you went, you went.  No, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Unfortunately.  You looked at yourself and said, I can't believe I fucked for that reason.  Like you, you fucked for, on a yacht or you fucked for just some really superficial  bullshit reason.  Um, yeah.  Like, like the, the, the, the, the fuck you have after you break up with your boyfriend,  you've had a, and you just gotta do it because you just feel horrible about yourself.  Damn.  Have you ever fucked for not prostitution, but you ever fucked for like a reason that 
[03:38:30]  wasn't noble where you just go, I'll fuck this guy.  Cause he just, he gave me dinner and he bought me some nice shoes.  No, no, never.  I don't, I don't have sex with people.  Really?  I, I like to try to convince me.  I don't believe it.  I got to see your picture of your hymen.  I believe the motherfucking shit.  You don't have sex with people.  Really?  No, I, I, I'm very picky about, I have to be in a relationship. 
[03:39:00]  Ah, yeah.  That's true.  So it's dangerous out there.  You don't know what you're getting from me.  But you, that's why, at my house, it's safe.  It's safe.  I have a compound and cameras and guns.  My house is, my house is covered in condoms.  Yeah.  It's a, it's a big rubber house.  And it has one of those rooms.  Did you build one of those rooms and you, you put the fucking clothes on and they spray  you first?  The fucking outbreak room?  Yeah.  It's a deep contamination chamber. 
[03:39:30]  There's a gun room and an outbreak room and shit.  I, um, do we get, do we?  There's a woman in his pool before he, what?  All right, Pat.  I didn't hear what you said, actually.  Well, I'll tell you.  Oh, go ahead.  Did I interrupt you?  Oh.  How old are you?  I'm 24.  Did we get past the whole high school thing?  I missed that.  That's settled.  No, that's fine.  That's the 24 is good?  Well, you know, one thing, one thing I find that, uh.  It's like, very cute.  I know, I do.  I look younger.  Yeah.  It's because I haven't slept around.  And I never did any drugs.  What's that got to do with your 20?  I take care of myself.  Because you look older if you do stupid stuff. 
[03:40:00]  If you fuck, you look older?  Yeah.  I didn't know anything about pussy and acne fucking research study they did along with  the death of the bumblebee.  My mom called it mileage.  She just says anything.  Mileage.  Yeah, mileage.  You're going to get mileage.  Gosh, she could just say, beautiful woman could just say any goofy scientific studies  that haven't been done and she would just say it.  And it's fact.  It's fucking amazing.  Do you drink it all?  Yes.  Yeah, I do.  But not very often, though.  Just on the weekends.  She doesn't have a martini or two. 
[03:40:30]  What type of snacks?  Anthony's good with snacks if you let him know a month in advance.  Oh, shut up.  What kind of snacks would you have?  I have plenty of stuff in my house.  Snacks like what kind of snacks?  We're talking high-end snacks or watching the football game kind of snacks?  Anything you want, he'll have there.  Just let him know.  I don't know.  You'll have to let me know.  I'd have a great assortment.  I'd have to think about that.  No, but she might have something specific she likes, which makes you look better.  She may enjoy something particular.  I like wine and cheese and fruit.  You ever have Diet Rufino?  Rufino.  Is it true you want to sing for us? 
[03:41:00]  I do.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you want to sing?  I want to show you that I can sing like a black woman.  Wow.  No, no.  It's just a joke.  I played a demo for one of my friends once, and he goes, who is that, some black woman?  And I'm like, no, no, that's me.  Well, let's have a sing.  Let's go to it, Neglic.  Now that we're on the notice, we're going to sleep with you, we're going to give you  a real opinion.  This is a little song called Hands Off, You Swarty Guinea.  Keep your hands on me, you're 52. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, baby, yeah.  Take your pools and your guns and go fuck yourself.  Wash your hands again.  Wash them again.  Wash them again.  That's the wrong hole, baby.  What song again?  This song is the title, I don't give a fuck about your 90 degree pool, bitch.  I'm staying in South Jersey with young men. 
[03:42:00]  Let's hear a song.  Okay, well, I was going to dedicate it to Anthony, actually.  Stand up and take your pants down there.  Thank you, Jamie.  Oh, you're welcome.  It's a little overshot because, you know, we haven't even hung out yet, but it's a romantic  song.  Oh, that's cool.  And it's a classic.  I hope she becomes obsessed with Anthony and falls in love and stalks him to where it's  uncomfortable.  That would be great. 
[03:42:30]  She stands outside your window and starts throwing rocks.  Come out.  Three in the morning.  You never know.  You never know.  In bizarro land.  All right, you ready?  All right, hold on.  I've got to clear my throat.  Hold on.  Make noise for a second.  Get all those black hairs out of there from the 10th grade.  Those black curlies.  Get them out.  All right, ready?  La, la, la, la.  Okay.  This is the...  Oh, my gosh.  I'm nervous.  This is the most nervous I've ever been. 
[03:43:00]  Help me.  Okay.  At last, my love has come along.  My lonely days are over.  And life is like a song.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  At last.  What do you think?  I was so excited to do that for you. 
[03:43:30]  Do you like me more now?  Well, let me tell you something, darling.  You're going to Long Island.  Yay!  Wow.  American Idol, sir.  American Idol, sir.  Very good.  Yeah.  Very good.  Thanks.  Just wait until you see the karaoke stage I have downstairs. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I have a bar and a karaoke stage.  Oh, his house is just made up for fucking fun.  Whatever a girl likes, he has a room full of rubber balls in case you're a little younger.  The ball pit.  A piece of oven.  It's fucking...  It's just fucking...  A water slide.  So I'll bring my little sister.  I'll bring my little sister, and she can play in the other room. 
[03:44:30]  How old is she?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  She's 12.  Oh!  Yeah.  What's her name?  What's her name?  Yeah.  Her name's Victoria.  I remember her.  She's a lovely girl.  Oh, Uncle Paul style.  Stop.  Be nice.  So, where did Bobo go?  I don't get to meet him.  Oh, Christ.  Jesus.  If she was in, that would have been shockingly...  They told me not to come in.  I was like, well, I was ready to come in.  You can meet him.  I mean, you can meet him, but I couldn't do that.  Nothing but trouble.  By the way, we blew off Jeremy Piven for you, so that's how important you are to our show. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, thanks.  He was on hold for 20 minutes, so...  Was he?  Oh, we're going to hear something about that.  What time did he call in, though?  About an hour late, so you don't want to...  By the way, look at Bobo running.  We've got to run our show here.  Oh, my gosh.  Look, here he comes.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  No, no, don't be.  Bobo.  Stand over there, Bobo, with that microphone.  I thought he was going to, like, bum rush me.  Bobo, this is Jamie.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm going to play this game with you.  You ever meet Jamie?  I think I got an extra ticket, because it looks like my sister isn't going. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah?  See, you automatically just...  Wow.  You know what I'm going to do?  I didn't know what to do.  I would love it if she said, sure, Bobo.  Yeah.  I don't have anything.  Can you imagine?  My friend has two tickets, and I didn't know what to do with the ticket.  I said, leave that extra ticket.  I'm going to figure out if it...  Oh, my God.  He is flustered.  I sometimes get calls, oh, I want to go to the game.  I get...  Bobo, do you find her attractive?  Isn't she beautiful?  Isn't she pretty?  Yeah, she's attractive. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, thanks.  Attractive and direct across the river here.  What?  What do you mean?  Well, there must be something in the water in New Jersey.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's called lead.  If they're producing hot chicks like this.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Jersey Shore has some pretty hot ladies.  I said, everybody knows me.  I always think that the Tri-State always produces hot ladies.  It's because they're so high-maintenance.  Ladies.  Ladies. 
[03:46:30]  You said that you don't think girls from Jersey are very attractive.  No, I think they are.  I think he's changing his story.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I've gone to Jersey, and I always see some hot chicks down in Jersey.  You said that the Jersey Shore is the worst girls you've seen.  No, that isn't true, Jimmy.  You said the Jones Beach girls.  I'm not lying.  Worst or skankiest?  Oh, skanky's good.  No, I said they're hot.  Oh, oh, okay.  That's because we're so high-maintenance.  Jersey girls are, like, all about being, you know, my hair, my nails, my tanning. 
[03:47:00]  You know?  The tanning salons.  Did Convino and Rich put you on the show?  Yeah.  Okay, the next year?  The what?  Believe me, I've seen some hot chicks.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, last year, what?  I've gone out to the stress factory.  I've seen some hot chicks in the audience.  Hot chicks.  I have.  So where have you been in Jersey?  Well, I haven't really been many places in Jersey.  I know I've been to the stress factory a few times.  Newark Airport.  I went to this. 
[03:47:30]  Number two.  I'm not hanging at Newark Airport.  Stress factory at Newark Airport.  No, I've been to this beach in New Jersey.  I think it's that beach off the Jersey Shore.  What?  Liberty State Park.  I've been to Englewood Cliffs.  Yeah, there's a lot of beaches on the Jersey Shore.  He's been everywhere in beach now.  In Jersey.  No, no, no.  She has the same face talking to Bobo as she did talking to you.  Is that it?  Oh, that's not true.  I sang to him.  That listening, uh-huh face.  Of course, I've been to Great Adventure, which is obvious. 
[03:48:00]  No, no.  She sang a lovely song to me, Patrice.  I did.  And I made eye contact, too.  Yeah.  Actually, by the way, I think I know they must have left my phone here.  And I looked him straight in the fucking eye.  I looked him in the eye.  At this motherfucker.  As I'm going, holy shit.  I'm going to get my phone here.  We don't like Anthony because he's funny.  That's how I didn't find my phone.  Anthony is, you know, we tease this.  I wouldn't call this cock blockery.  We are, you know, radio teasing.  No, I see this.  I see the future. 
[03:48:30]  I see a future.  I wouldn't see it as anything with that.  I just want to see.  She's a pretty girl.  She's very nice.  A couple beautiful girls.  And I think if we hung out, we'd have a lot of laughs.  I think we would, too.  Is it going to happen or what?  A lot of fun.  Give Anthony some hope.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  And no offense, if this is an offensive question, you can, what are you, like, a 32D?  Something ridiculous like that?  Oh, God.  I knew it.  I knew.  Everyone's like, oh, they're going to say something about you.  Well, you have to because you're very small.  I know. 
[03:49:00]  Don't lump me into the bay.  I'll say the same thing that I say to everybody.  What's the number?  What's the number?  What's the number?  Not the cup.  The number.  Number's 32.  Yeah, probably like a 32C or D or something.  32, yeah.  C.  It ain't a C.  No way it's a C, buddy boy.  It's a full C.  It's a full C.  I vote L.  He knows.  Really?  You think it's a full C?  Yeah, yeah.  I hope he's pretty good at the...  Do you think so?  I got money.  You want to make a couple dollars?  I'll bet you 20 bucks.  And it's a D.  Girl, no, they go small and pack it in. 
[03:49:30]  That's a C bra.  I guarantee it.  How much you want?  That's a D and a C bra.  That's a D and a C bra.  Because she doesn't want to be a 32C.  But the bra, but I'm talking about the actual breasts themselves.  She's wearing...  Wait, wait, wait.  You're saying D, I say C.  She's wearing a C, but the breasts are a D.  We're talking about the bra she's got on right now.  No, I'm not talking about the bra.  So I'm talking about what is her size.  She's probably pushing a D into a C.  32D.  I say 32D.  I'll bet that that's what she has. 
[03:50:00]  But not that she'd put a D titty in a B cup bra.  She could do anything.  She could put it in a shoe.  The girls never go big with the bra.  They always squeeze into the smaller size.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I...  Her titties are at 16E wide.  Right.  And no offense.  The nips, sensitive, get fucking hard like...  Like Bobo's top?  Like, you know.  What?  Like, are they sensitive and they get hard?  Some girls with big breasts, they don't really mean anything. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They do, yeah.  They really?  Yeah, I still have...  So you're a very sensual girl.  Oh, you had a job.  What?  You said still have sensation.  You had a job?  They're not real?  It's okay.  Oh, oh, oh.  I was like, what?  I'm sorry.  It sounds kind of like you said it was a job, but you still have sensation as if you had  a job done.  No, I don't even...  I don't talk about it.  So you had a job.  You're lying.  It's always going to be a mystery.  Sorry.  It's not a mystery, but I mean, it is because you're saying it, but she had a job. 
[03:51:00]  How do you know?  How do you know?  Because you would say no if you didn't.  You had a job.  You wouldn't say, I'm not telling anybody.  You were too young to have a job.  Ethiopia has that rack.  What?  You're skinny.  Holy shit.  Pat is flustered, man.  Pat is fucked up in the corner over there.  He's been around all that gorgeousness for, what, a good 30 minutes now?  He's probably smelling her, like, deodorant and stuff and freaking out. 
[03:51:30]  Why are you yelling at her?  She's a nice girl.  Oh, she's giving him underarm smoke.  This girl, man, I like her, man, because she does know how to pinpoint men.  She's good with men.  She would actually wave underarms.  Yeah, yeah.  She's really not a control man.  She really does.  Yeah.  She tried to master black guy.  Here's what happened.  She's mastered every fucking guy.  In high school, she tried to master black guys, but the thing, black guys are so sexually  aggressive that she couldn't keep this guy at bay with her fucking technique of cock teasing.  So he's like, come on, bitch, you know. 
[03:52:00]  And she's just like, I can't, Leroy, you're too fucking, you're too aggressive.  And got rid of him because he was way too aggressive.  And, uh, but ever since she's been trying to figure out how to con black dudes too, because  black dudes get mad with a lot of dick teasing.  For some reason, white guys love cock teasing for some reason.  Is that true?  Oh, you're very patient.  You're patient with cock teasing.  Before we go to rape.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying we just go fuck that, give it, we're raping bitches, but 
[03:52:30]  we have a little less fucking, we don't, we don't have as much patience.  Like if the police officer's a woman and she violates you, she's a cock tease.  I'm sorry, black people.  I opened us up to be rapists.  Listen to me.  We don't have any patience for cock teasing.  Like if that cracker bitch is putting groceries in her car, we don't stand for that shit.  I'm going to put a new cord out on her back.  What the fuck is that bitch doing just stopping at a red light like that? 
[03:53:00]  Get out the car, bitch.  I'm sorry.  Can we square something up though before vacation?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I know.  You guys get two weeks off?  Yeah.  Are you going to have a party, dude?  Yeah, I'm definitely having a party.  Definitely having a party.  Come on.  Monday or Tuesday, dude.  I'll be right over there.  Whatever day is, all you guys can make it over.  Monday.  Monday's better.  Monday's good.  No, it's not patch.  No patch.  And you know there's a site before, there's a site my girl found for some reason. 
[03:53:30]  You put in somebody's address, so don't give your address, Al.  Put in the address, tell you how much you pay for your house.  Oh, I know.  Your name.  Oh, I know.  The fucking property.  It's crazy.  Why would a site be like that?  Why would there be a site like that around?  It's shocking.  I'm just letting you know.  An agent of privacy.  Yeah, don't fucking just blurt your fucking...  I have a listener, just come to my house one day.  Your fucking address out of nothing.  Don't.  I have a listener, come to my house one day.  Just, hey, I knew where you lived.  Oh, that's really creepy.  Figured I'd come to the house.  Dude.  I was like, oh yeah, come on in for a beer. 
[03:54:00]  Man, I told you how much you paid and the fucking everything, man.  So don't...  It's weird.  Crazy.  Don't make a mistake.  All right.  Playing around.  Therese, let's get the plugs out of the way.  We've got to get out of here for real.  But wait, I want to square something up a little bit.  Oh, go, go, go, go, go.  I just want to square something up.  Okay, go ahead.  You're free when?  When would it be good for us to finally...  Like, Sunday.  So you're free Sunday?  Yeah, definitely Sunday.  Because I don't...  Tonight, probably not.  And tomorrow, I don't think I do.  So you want to do something earlier or a little later?  Because you're out Saturday.  I don't know.  Are you going to be tired or something?  I don't know.  We'll have to figure...  It depends on how much I do Saturday night. 
[03:54:30]  All right.  I'll call you up and we'll do, like, maybe a late lunch, early dinner kind of thing.  All right.  We'll work it out.  And see where that goes.  We'll work it out.  Okay.  Yeah.  Cool.  Sunday.  Oh, there's the music.  Quick plugs.  Go ahead.  Patrice O'Neill, the 21st, 22nd at the Cleveland Improv.  21st, 22nd, 23rd, Cleveland Improv in Cleveland, of course.
