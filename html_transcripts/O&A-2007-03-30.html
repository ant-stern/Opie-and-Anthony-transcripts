<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, engaging in humorous, nonsensical banter, including a mention of a strong smell and a self-described “shapely European blonde.”  They announced an upcoming live broadcast from Chicago and a planned visit in the spring.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a feud with Mancow Muller, focusing on Muller's criticisms of their show and their past experiences with him, including a staged radio stunt Norton participated in with Muller.  Anthony attempted to call Muller's show, posing as a listener, but the attempt was thwarted when Muller allegedly hung up after being tipped off.  Muller's call screener, who insisted callers begin with “Mancow, love you, love your show,” was also repeatedly called and ridiculed by Opie and Anthony, who repeatedly referred to Muller as a "pussy boy" and a "coward."  Audio clips of the prank calls were played throughout this segment.  The hosts also briefly mentioned a past conflict with the Boston Herald's "Inside Track" columnists.

The show featured their "Story of the Month" segment, highlighting the arrest of a nude middle school principal found watching gay porn with drugs and sex toys.  This was followed by a story about Bradley Bernstein, a 48-year-old autistic and mentally retarded man whose parents used a cattle prod on him for 40 years to control self-harm.  The segment included a news report where the reporter allowed Bradley's mother to shock her with the cattle prod.  Listener calls followed, discussing the ethical implications of this method.  Following this, Kurt Russell was interviewed in studio about his new movie, *Grindhouse*, discussing the film's style, Tarantino's directing, and Russell's past roles (including *Poseidon*, *Escape from New York*, *Tango & Cash*, *Used Cars*, and *Big Trouble in Little China*).

The broadcast was significantly interrupted by a female listener, “Kay,” appearing nude on Paltalk.  This caused a major disruption, with the hosts struggling to regain control while simultaneously engaging in sexually explicit descriptions of Kay and her actions.  The discussion veered between attempts to manage the situation and tangents about British hostages in Iran, Heather Mills, and Bob Saget.  Listeners called in, expressing both frustration and amusement.  Other topics discussed included a telemarketer making death threats, women's self-consciousness about nudity with partners (including a phone interview with a woman from a hair salon), and a discussion about Kay's departure from Paltalk.  The segment concluded with discussion of video games, specifically Grand Theft Auto IV, and a final mention of XM Satellite Radio.  Studio employees Jimmy Florentine and Kenny were involved in the unfolding events.

The show continued with a discussion of the geographical differences between the Missouri and Kansas sides of Kansas City, followed by talk of upcoming tour dates for comedian Jimmy "The Reverend" and their radio presence in various markets.  The hosts engaged with a studio audience, exchanging crude jokes.  A package arrived containing Yankee Stadium opening day tickets for Anthony and a paperclip for Opie, leading to further banter.  They discussed their work schedules and an upcoming Black Sabbath interview, which complicated the ticket situation, involving interactions with their boss, Elo, who was described as having an instant replay system in his office.  A significant portion focused on Eric Logan's attendance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, including crude jokes about Logan and various politicians, including Karl Rove.  The possibility of Opie throwing the first pitch at a baseball game was also discussed.  Laszlo, who had recently returned from a trip to Germany including Auschwitz, detailed his experience, including descriptions of preserved human remains and the Auschwitz gift shop.  He also discussed his work as a “Technophile,” including experiences at a technology convention with topless booth babes. The segment ended with further discussion of Laszlo's trip, a sexually explicit audio clip, and a call to action to harass Mancow Muller.  A racist and antisemitic song was also played.

The final segment began with a discussion of a condom mistakenly placed on a cell phone, transitioning to new digital cameras with GPS capabilities and a humorous routing error on FARC.com.  A call from a listener, "Too Fat" from Hoboken, was plagued by technical difficulties.  The hosts discussed breathalyzer technology in cell phones for workplace drug testing.  The majority of the segment focused on Too Fat's attempt to get a woman he was with, "Jane," to perform sexual acts on camera for the hosts.  Jane ultimately refused their explicit requests.  The segment ended with off-color jokes, the announcement of the "line of the day," and the show's sign-off, mentioning Laszlo's show the following night.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Creeping through the shadow, an unstoppable force.  Lays and wait, ready to strike.  Oh my God!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I can't see her.  I can't see her.  I can't see her.  Oh, God!  Holy mother of God.  Oh boy.  Please don't. 
[00:00:30]  God damn it.  What?  Oh, it stinks so bad.  Oh my God.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  Uh-oh.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my God!  I'm telling you, Jonathan!  You're God damn it!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh!  Shut up!  Oh!  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  Oh!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  She enticed me.  She enticed me.  Enticed me.  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me.  This is what it sounds like when doves cry. 
[00:02:00]  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Friday edition.  Thank God it's...  Ah!  T-G-I...  The O-N-A virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  And starting Monday morning, we go live in Chicago.  Yeah.  That's very, very cool.  Extremely cool.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What are you looking at?  Ah, just the news is all around us, Opie.  Yeah.  I'm watching three different screens.  All kinds of news going on.  I can't get that stupid Karl Rove dancing off the screen. 
[00:03:00]  I even watched it last night on the computer for a little while.  I, like, picked it apart.  I saw it from different angles.  I saw the entire thing.  Yeah, they got a long version of it.  Yeah, where at one point he pulls out his cell phone and makes like he's talking with  his homies on the phone.  I'm sure everyone's seen it by now.  The Karl Rove dancing at the, um...  That stupid press politician get-together they do every year. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  Karl Rove.  Did he...  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Did he think he was cool on any level?  Or did he say, all right, I'll just be the laughing stock of the entire world.  Of the world.  That would be like watching Bin Laden doing, like, the Charleston.  Da-da-da-da.  Doing that weird thing where he holds his kneecaps and then, like, switches his hands back and forth.  Just, our leadership looks like a bunch of dolts. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I swear to God, I don't know what to say about that.  I know.  I'm sitting here, like...  It's so mind-blowing to look at.  Like, I watched it yesterday and couldn't speak.  I couldn't speak.  We just look like idiots.  And every newscaster that showed it, when they came back, they were just, like, stunned, too.  So, a few of them were saying, I don't have anything to say about that. 
[00:04:30]  Or, I'm glad that's over.  Or, they just...  You think the Chinese are doing that?  No.  They take it seriously every moment of every day.  They're buying up everything.  And that's why they're coming.  They're on their way.  Yeah, you won't see any Chinese doing those dances.  They just look silly, you know, doing normal things.  With the dragon thing on, with the firecrackers going off their feet.  But, that's a little silly.  You see them doing something called the fluff and fold. 
[00:05:00]  It's a big-ass deal.  Yeah, well.  All right.  Well, the phone's ringing like crazy for some reason.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Boston.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, I love you guys.  Love the show.  Oh.  See, our call screener's getting to you.  Good, good.  I guess we've got to bring everyone on board.  Yesterday's Opie and Anthony's show, wow, the ending was just terrific.  Yes.  We've been going after everybody lately. 
[00:05:30]  It just seems everyone's a douchebag.  Well, I'll tell you why, though.  Well, I'll tell you why, though.  Because we're being mentioned in a lot of articles, which is nice for the show.  It means people are paying attention, and we've got some popularity out there.  Yep.  We went after the manatees from the Inside Track in Boston, at the Boston Herald.  The fat broads that write the gossip column over there.  You notice they kept their big, fat mouths shut after we went after them?  Not for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, though.  See, I...  That's when they opened up their maw. 
[00:06:00]  They knew they just came up with some just lies, and we called them out on it, and what  did they do?  They had no source to name.  No.  Because they made it up.  They were hinting that we're leaving BCN for Dennis and Callahan.  It's not happening.  No.  And then we find out that one of the guys writes for the Boston Herald.  Yeah.  So who leaked that?  So we called out the fatos.  Said, name your source.  And of course, they just sat there and hid and cowered, because that's what happens 
[00:06:30]  when you really challenge these gossip columnists.  They get nothing.  Wait, one of the guys on that show writes for that stupid paper?  Yeah.  He started his own rumor, and the stupid manatees picked up on it.  You know, our own John Minnelli was the consultant for the manatees.  They had a radio show in Boston.  Yeah.  And he was like, oh my God, this is the worst show ever.  Yeah.  And they're off the air, but they lasted, I don't know,  a little bit.  And John was brought in to be a consultant for, I think it was WTKK or something like 
[00:07:00]  that.  It was like a talk station.  They were, are they, I guess they're still doing some kind of a thing there.  I couldn't tell you.  And Minnelli comes in to consult, and he's like, oh my God, they're God awful.  But the station was too scared to get rid of them right away, because, you know, they  got a little power with this stupid Boston Herald gossip column they do, the inside track.  But finally, they got rid of the fatzos, and they went back to being, you know, little  nosy Pete's gossips.  And we called them out this week, because we're mentioned in the article. 
[00:07:30]  That's why, that's why it seems like we're taking on everybody, because lately there's  a lot of people writing about us.  Yeah, we don't really mouth off about people unless they start, you know, mouthing off  about us.  And then we, what are we supposed to do, just sit back and not say anything?  Yeah.  Well, yesterday.  Well, yesterday you did sit back and you did not say anything.  Well, I tried.  You don't think I thought about this all night?  How was your night, Anthony?  I was restless.  I did a lot of thinking. 
[00:08:00]  I read some messages.  A lot of what ifs.  I read some message boards last night.  Oh, I know.  Oof.  I was getting pounded.  Oof.  Funny.  Look, I was so close to pulling that trigger.  Well, we finally got on the phone with Man Cow.  Well, he wrote.  Should we get into that now or a little later?  I think because they're still trying to find the article because we're just, we're  minding our own business at the end of the Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  And then we, someone brings it to our attention that Man Cow is trashing us again. 
[00:08:30]  Mouthing off about it.  And calling us failures in this article.  And it's like, who's the, who's, who's failing in this business?  Who's the failure?  If you put our careers side to side, look who the failure is.  Is it the guy that's lost just about every major market he was ever in and is on in  maybe, uh, how many was it?  Maybe 10 or.  It was about 10 or 12, uh, places.  And most of these. 
[00:09:00]  You can't even call them markets.  They're just like places.  You're right.  They're big towns.  They're not even cities.  They're big towns.  And one of his big gets was Des Moines.  And he got dropped from Des Moines.  Dropped from Des Moines.  He's not even heard in Chicago where he made his name in radio.  They even said, like, who wants to hear a goody two-shoes?  And he's just, yeah.  He is a goody two-shoes.  Who the hell wants to hear a goody two-shoe?  A born-again goody two-shoes.  He used to be the shock jock.  Right.  And now he's coming out against any type of, uh, uh, actually any type of entertaining 
[00:09:30]  radio.  Not even shock jock.  It's like, it's like now saying you're coming out against hippies.  There aren't any shock jocks left.  You know, there really aren't.  There are a few dopey shows doing some dopey things.  But as far as the shock jock genre, that's extinct now.  The FCC, and the fear of the FCC, has pretty much put a stop to that kind of radio.  We're still an edgy show, but, uh, even back in the day, we didn't want to be known as 
[00:10:00]  shock jocks.  That's such an easy label to put on a radio show.  But it's, it's, it's what the press will see.  Like, and that's something you got to do as a radio show.  You have to get attention.  So you do things that get attention.  And that's all the press sees.  They don't listen to the show on a daily basis.  So they make you out as a shock jock, which is fine.  That's how they see it.  I have no problem with that.  But, uh, uh, man cow, uh, is completely denying the fact that, uh, that's what he did. 
[00:10:30]  He was, he was a shock jock and he was one of those, like, just typical hack shock jocks.  Everything he did was fake and set up.  Like, uh, and even his listeners, uh, are chiming in on message boards and stuff and saying,  yeah, we, you know, all that stuff is fake.  When he had his, uh, stunt guy, uh, turd, turd, are you okay, turd?  I, I, he's in the car.  He's headed toward the wall.  Turd, turd, are you okay?  And then you would hear some awful sound effect, uh, from the sound effect library. 
[00:11:00]  You'd hear like a car crash.  Car crash scream that you heard on, like, some ABC show the night before.  It's like, wait, I heard that car crash.  It's like the fake scream.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you'll hear this.  Go in, I, I hear that on the ONA show.  That's when a joke bombs.  That's not even a real car crash, what you're hearing.  That was made up in a studio somewhere.  Yeah, you will hear that scream on TV show trailers everywhere. 
[00:11:30]  Sure.  It's like, on the next 24, a woman's in trouble.  You'll hear that.  Well, believe me, I laugh every time I hear it.  I go, hey, that's our scream.  By the way, uh, man cow's gonna have a lot of fun on his show today.  Our pests are beating the crap out.  Oh, of course.  Right out of the gate today.  Anyway, uh, I think this is the one you're talking about, Anthony.  It's quick.  Turd?  Yes, sir.  Are you ready, bud?  Fifteen.  Fifteen miles an hour. 
[00:12:00]  He's gonna give us the countdown.  Twenty.  Racing into the side of a factory.  Twenty-five.  A factory.  Thirty.  Thirty.  Thirty miles an hour.  Anything happens to him, pal?  Thirty-five.  Thirty-five miles an hour, right now.  Oh, my God.  You're the concern hole in the background.  The long course has been set up.  Oh, my God.  Come on, turd.  Thirty-five.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:12:30]  The dial tone and...  Look, I just got the biggest douche...  Look at my arm.  Deuce chills for everybody.  Little bumps on it.  Deuce chill.  Into the side of a factory.  Dramatic music, car crash scream, and then the phone hangs up.  Yeah, what?  And then, oh, my God, is he all right?  I don't know.  You okay, turd?  Hopefully he'll call before the end of today's show.  And then, of course, he doesn't call, because you want to get the TSL up, right, man cow? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, well, maybe we'll hear from him tomorrow from the hospital.  And then you don't, because you want to keep that TSL in the queue.  I'm coming in, right, man cow?  And then finally you get the update.  The reality is that sounds so fake.  I'm embarrassed for him.  Did anyone listen to that and think it was real?  It was in Chicago that they actually were digging this crap.  Matter of fact, our own little Jimmy Norton was in on one of his fake stunts.  We found that out yesterday before Jimmy Norton was involved with this fine program. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I was doing very little radio.  I was touring with Dice.  I think it was like 98 or 99.  Yeah.  And I met man cow, and he flew me out to Chicago to play a rapist on his show, like on the radio show, to play a rapist.  Like, he said you have to be a rapist, and he was like, kind of like, be concerned, like, activist.  So he's going to be the guy that's outraged at your actions.  Yes.  So he can make himself look like a good guy.  Like, look at what I'm doing. 
[00:14:00]  I'm exposing this guy, and I'm not going to take any guff from him.  And meanwhile, it's Jim Norton, comedian.  Well, as perverted as I am, I've never even forced anybody to do anything in bed, much less raped anybody.  I feel like a tool because it's like we're talking, and I had, like, notes and stuff.  I don't know how to be a rapist.  It's not as easy as you think.  You know, I get out of the shoe polish, and I put it all over my arm and face.  And at one point, he goes, there was a girl's voice.  He goes, get out of here.  I don't want you near this guy.  I don't want you near this guy. 
[00:14:30]  But I'm like, there was no one in here.  There was no one else in the studio.  He was an invisible girl.  Yeah, no one had come in.  And then he was kind of goading me into, like, saying, like, do I molest children?  And I didn't go down that road.  I'm like, no, I don't like kids because I think I'm going to be a rapist, not a pedophile.  Right, right.  You know, there's, like, different genres of that.  Of course.  Your motivation.  Yes.  Just about all of his show was just over-the-top fake.  It was phony, set-up stuff.  So, now, Mancow made a huge living being a shock jock for Chicago and other markets.  Did very well. 
[00:15:00]  He's living in a fine, fine house, a mansion.  Mm-hmm.  Has more money than he knows what to do with.  But all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's, like, wants to be responsible on the radio and  start an organization for responsible radio.  So, we're like, oh, yeah?  Why don't you make a real statement?  And this is in print now today, by the way.  Why don't you make a real statement and give back all the money that you made being a shock  jock?  That would make a statement.  Yeah.  Give it to charity.  Give it away. 
[00:15:30]  And then, well, and then he's saying stuff like, well, voyeuristic radio's dead.  No, it's not, by the way.  No, it's not.  People still like to listen to radio shows like they're rubbernecking a car crash on the  highway.  Trust me.  That'll never go away.  That'll never go away.  Voyeuristic radio will always be around.  And he said.  He likes using that term.  Voyeuristic radio is over since the Janet Jackson incident.  He said.  No, the reality is he changed as a person and became whatever. 
[00:16:00]  A douche.  Whatever he is.  Yeah.  He said that 9-11 and the birth of his kids changed me completely and changed him into,  yeah, a douche, a douche that even his hardcore fans now see as a douche and aren't listening  to.  And he's being thrown out of markets left and right.  Talk about failure.  The guy has been thrown out of small markets.  He's on in 10 towns. 
[00:16:30]  Not even on in Chicago anymore.  And then he lies and says, well, people are, you know, I'm getting offers around Chicago.  No, you're not.  He's a liar.  Yeah.  And we wouldn't even have brought him up, but he had to drag us into his crap.  Yeah.  We got the statement finally.  So we comment about it.  And then he says, you know, he doesn't want anything to do with us hitching onto his star,  which that killed me yesterday when I read that.  We can't even pronounce the towns he's in. 
[00:17:00]  And we want to hitch onto that star.  Could you throw up his markets again for us?  Because we can't even pronounce them.  They're big towns in America that we've never heard of before.  You know, we're in such places as Chicago, New York, New York City, Boston, Vegas.  You know, it goes on and on.  Cleveland and Providence and all these places.  And he's in such markets as, wow, there's only one station listed.  He must have had a really bad night. 
[00:17:30]  Anyway, here's his statement.  Embattled former CBS radio chairman, CEO Joel Hollander, who was ousted this past Monday  and replaced by Dan Mason, particularly draws man cow's ire.  Iire.  This guy was the NAB point man for bringing back terrestrial radio  and controlled a tremendous amount of radio time in America.  What did he do?  He brought in and promoted satellite radio shows.  That is disgraceful.  The government needs to wake up and bust monopolies.  I hate to say I was right, but I knew this would fail. 
[00:18:00]  I'm the only guy who said that since the beginning.  Opie and Anthony are failing miserably.  Are we?  We're on in 25 cities across America, I believe.  And that number seems to go up almost weekly at this point.  You know, let me do a little horn-tooting here for a second.  Anyone in radio right now would love to be failing like we're failing right now.  There isn't a personality around that wouldn't want to be failing as miserably as we are right now. 
[00:18:30]  You get anyone in radio and say, whose career would you like to have right now, ONAs or man cow's?  And I believe they would pick this program, then pick the one that's in 10 towns, small little towns around the Midwest.  And pretty much the number one show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:19:00]  Let's not forget that.  Okay.  So, yeah, we're just failing miserably.  Okay.  And then he says, there are no talent individuals, and they cannot survive in a post-Janet Jackson or post-9-11 world.  How moronic is it that Opie and Anthony would be your morning show?  Look at people like David Lee Roth, Dennis Miller, Whoopi Goldberg.  Can we stop?  There are radio people who can do this job because we know this art form.  We know this art form. 
[00:19:30]  Well, your art form is getting you thrown off of stations.  And the only stations you have left are small little towns around the country.  You're a loser.  You're a failure.  You're a douche.  And now he wants to do responsible radio.  Well, give back the money you made being a shock jock, and then I'll be impressed.  I'll admit it.  I'll finally be impressed.  My foundation for responsible radio.  Voyeuristic radio is dead. 
[00:20:00]  Voyeuristic radio is dead.  Really?  What I'm doing now is educated radio.  You're an ass.  So we brought this to everyone's attention yesterday late in the show.  And then we said, you know what, we try to fight our battles face-to-face, whether it's  face-to-face, like I'm looking at Jimmy, or on a phone, kind of face-to-face, you know  what I mean?  We try to have some kind of contact with the person we're having a problem with.  No middleman writer for a trade publication is what we're talking about. 
[00:20:30]  We got a problem.  We get on the phone and try to get the guy and actually talk to that person.  Yeah, and by the way, for the people that kind of heard a lot of this yesterday, we  do have an update, so don't worry.  You'll get something new here today.  So after the break, I can tell you this much.  Anthony, from the Opie and Anthony show, was on the phone with Man Cow yesterday.  That's right.  And we're going to show you how it went.  We're going to let you hear how it went. 
[00:21:00]  No holds barred.  No holds barred.  It was ugly.  Yes, it was ugly.  We got the tapes to prove how ugly it was yesterday, and we're going to play him next  on the Opie and Anthony show.

The ONA virus spreading across America in the middle of this man-cow thing that happened 
[00:22:30]  yesterday.  You know, he takes his shots at us from time to time.  I do believe, and we don't toot our horn off him, but I do believe there's a jealousy  thing happening there.  He got kicked out of Chicago.  His hometown station didn't want him anymore because the dude kind of turned his back on  what got him to where he was in radio.  Which is fine if you're able to then do something else.  But the guy's incapable of doing the type of radio he wants to do. 
[00:23:00]  He wants to be like Sean Hannity, like Rush Limbaugh.  Yeah, he wants to be relevant.  He wants to be political.  He wants to be accepted as a legitimate news guy.  And he's really too stupid and uninformed and ignorant to do that type of radio.  That type of radio takes a lot of work.  Right.  Believe it or not, a lot of people are like, you know, I don't like that kind of stuff. 
[00:23:30]  Whatever.  But you really have to be informed as to what's going on in the world if you're going  to do that kind of radio.  And that doesn't even really bother me.  The fact that what really bothers me is he made a lot of money doing the shock jock thing.  And now all of a sudden out of nowhere, because he can't do it anymore, he's going to start  an organization for responsibility in broadcasting.  And I say it again, you know, make a real statement.  Give back all the money that you made being a shock jock.  And he's trying to use this organization to take away the radio shows that had the ability 
[00:24:00]  to adapt to these new rules that were put on by the FCC and the radio companies and actually  do a show that's still edgy and fun to do.  And then he turns around and trashes shows like us and say voyeuristic radio is dead.  Voyeuristic radio is not dead.  It will never die.  People still love peering in through the keyhole.  Right.  I've seen a nude broad behind the air.  And he continues to say that we're failures.  This guy would love to be on satellite radio.  Neither satellite radio company at this time has shown any interest in this guy. 
[00:24:30]  No one's shown interest in this guy.  We're pretty much the number one show on XM satellite radio.  I keep saying pretty much because in our demos that we're supposed to reach, we definitely  are.  But I think we're even the biggest show on XM overall.  Yeah.  Okay.  That alone is pretty damn impressive.  Okay.  But on top of that, then we get to broadcast on 25 radio stations across America.  That's not failing.  And he continues to say that we're failures.  As he's in such markets as Atlantic City slash Cape May. 
[00:25:00]  That's the closest market to New York City.  We're being heard in New York City on a regular radio station.  He's being heard in Atlantic City and he's telling us we're failures.  When I'm in Atlantic City, what I like to do is listen to the radio.  I don't like doing that gambling or anything when I'm down there.  Being in a casino, I like listening to the radio.  And if you look around the area that isn't casino in Atlantic City, I'm sure he goes over  well with the demo that's living in Atlantic City. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, of course.  We're in Washington, D.C.  The closest market I could find for him is Salisbury Ocean City.  Where is that?  I don't even know, man.  Maryland, I think.  And then you've got fine, fine big towns that he's in like Otsego, Minneapolis, Wausau, Wisconsin.  These are the big ones, by the way.  And this is the jackass that's calling us failures.  Missoula, Montana, Medford, Oregon, Stockton, California. 
[00:26:00]  The guy that called up Joel Hollander and was begging for Howard's old job.  And they would play the messages for the executives at CBS and laugh.  They would laugh at his messages.  Because he was pretty much begging.  Like, I know I can do the job.  I know I can do the job.  So they would play his messages and laugh at him.  Not even entertaining the thought of bringing him on board.  And he lies by going on and saying, yeah, well, you know, I'm going around and around with CBS and a lot of other radio companies. 
[00:26:30]  Are you?  No, you're not.  We're on in Chicago.  He's in Champaign, Illinois.  So that's pretty impressive.  You know, it just goes on and on.  Jamestown, North Dakota.  These are his markets.  There's not one big city among them.  Bismarck, North Dakota, Alice.  That's where the raccoons are buried.  It's amazing. 
[00:27:00]  So anyway, we decided to take it right to him yesterday.  We got his phone number.  And, well, Anthony got on with Man Cow yesterday.  Well, you know, it's very tough to get through a screener, to get on the air, to actually get the host to plunk down the phone line, to be on topic, and to fake everybody out.  And then it culminates in you revealing the prank, or in this case, we wanted to reveal who we were so we would be able to face him directly on the phone and confront his statements that he made about us being failures and why he's talking about us in interviews if he doesn't want anything to do with us, and address those things. 
[00:27:30]  So the only way to do that was to get through the screener, have a topic, talk about it, and then nail him on the air.  And if we were such failures, he could have taken us on very easily and just swatted us away, right? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  But old pussy boy doesn't want anything to do with us.  No.  Old pussy boy.  Well, here we go.  Anthony talks to the phone screener yesterday.  Yeah.  Now, this is a whole other thing, because is this the clip where the phone screener tells me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen what the phone screener is instructed to tell all the people that call in.  This is probably one of the most pathetic things I've ever heard in radio.  And I'm not kidding. 
[00:28:30]  When a host has to tell a screener to tell everyone that calls this, you have to be embarrassed.  Count the douche chills you get, by the way, as we play some of this audio.  Mancow, what's your topic?  Hi, how are you doing?  I'm great.  What do you want to say to Mancow?  Want to talk to the cow today?  A little bit about this situation with Britain and the sailors.  Okay, what do you want to say about that?  I want to say I believe that the United States is being kept out of this by Britain because we have such a bad world view that people look at the United States as troublemakers. 
[00:29:00]  And I think Britain is kind of snubbing us on this one.  Okay, so they're keeping the USA out of it?  Yeah, it's a statement that has been released from Britain that wants the United States to lay back on this and not get involved.  We should be all over this subject.  All over it.  And the president's not even commenting.  And that is because Britain has told us not to because the world view of the United States is very poor. 
[00:29:30]  And this wouldn't help.  They said it wouldn't help for the United States to become involved.  Huh.  What's your first name?  Tony.  Where are you calling from?  Calling from New York.  Listening online.  Very good.  A couple of things for the show, man.  Got to keep your radio or your audio down.  Got it.  Keep your comments clean, short and sweet, to the point. 
[00:30:00]  And start off by saying, man, Cal, love you, love your show, okay?  You got it.  Thank you, sir.  One moment.  Thank you.  I sound like such a douche.  No, you sold it, man.  You sold it.  Yeah, I had to sell it.  I saw he wasn't very interested, so I just said the same stuff with a little more energy.  Now, here's the deal, too, for the new listeners.  We had to get on ASAP because our listeners are just douches.  Let's be honest. 
[00:30:30]  The PES, they want to pile on.  They want to pile on immediately.  They don't understand a yield sign.  So as soon as they knew we had a problem with ManCal, they were already searching out numbers and websites and all this stuff.  And they were starting to make their calls as well.  Yeah, so they were going to blow up our spot.  Because the buildup to this was about 40 minutes, so we knew, oh, my God, the PES are right behind Anthony, if not right in front of him.  Now, how insecure, as a host, do you have to be to have your screener say, make sure you say, ManCal, love you, love the show? 
[00:31:00]  How insecure that the screener has to tell the listener to say that?  And we didn't even think it was possible that people would actually do this.  Yeah.  But they do it.  Oh, yeah.  How phony is that?  I mean, it's great when a caller calls and goes, hey, man, you know, I think the show's great.  Or I think the show sucks. 
[00:31:30]  Or whatever.  You know, you get this on this show on a daily basis.  There are people that call up, love the show, hate the show.  Well, we love it.  Take the calls.  But this one, the screener actually tells the callers to say that you love ManCal and you love his show.  So while you're on hold, you get to hear, like, you know, his listeners kissing his ass, which is just an embarrassment.  Because they've been told to.  Matt, hello.  Welcome to the program.  ManCal, love you.  Love your show.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:32:00]  And he thanks him with the reverend or the pastor or whatever.  He thanks him like, oh, it's spontaneous.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  I wasn't expecting that.  Wow.  Geez, thanks.  I really appreciate it.  You love me and love the show.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  I wasn't.  That came out of left field.  All right.  Such a surprise.  Marie, hello.  Hey, ManCal.  I love you.  Love your show.  Hi, what's up?  I just wanted to say that.  How embarrassing is this?  I am embarrassed for this idiot. 
[00:32:30]  You should say, like, praise the show.  If you want to say that, say something nice about the show, but not the same line.  Or even be humble about it.  Like, if you could, you think you could say something nice about the show, kind of use it.  We don't do any of that.  No, none of it's done.  But, I mean, in the worst case scenario, it should be, you know, could you say something  about the show?  We really need it.  We're on in towns.  It's not the same line over and over again.  How did Lister not pick up the show?  That's the same thing.  That's a rush thing.  He takes all his cues from Rush and Sean Hattie and all that. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, like, we love compliments, but we're not going to, like, force you to compliment  us.  Well, we did yesterday after we heard this.  We thought it would be funny if people actually said, love you, love the show, but they said  it with no, like, energy or passion.  The difference, and this is why we love our listeners in the end, they sounded like they  had a gun to their temple.  Yeah.  They're like, uh, One, uh, love you, love the show.  Classic jackasses.  Uh, let's go to, uh, let's go to Jimmy. 
[00:33:30]  Jimmy, hello.  Hi, man, Cal.  Love you, love your show.  See, it's just like, I was told to say that.  I was told, and please, if you don't release 270 Palestinian prisoners, I will be killed.  That's what it sounds like.  He's got a serrated knife against his throat, and he's holding up today's newspaper.  Oh, that's.  Pleading to his family.  Love you, love the show.  Please get out of Iraq.  Yeah, people want to hear that instead of an honest show. 
[00:34:00]  The guy has been nothing but phony for his entire career, and it might work when you're  doing wacky turd stunts.  You might get some mongoloids that actually believe that's happening, but when you're  trying to be a legitimate, uh, poignant news guy, uh, it's not going to wash.  The phony, fake crap is going to be transparent to people that are actually interested in that 
[00:34:30]  type of radio.  All right, we finally got to the point.  Uh, so, so finally, Anthony gets on with, uh, Mandush.  And, uh, you know, the guy's been dodging us for a long time, but he's, but he's brave  on TV.  He's brave in print.  But now, finally, here's the moment.  It is.  Here is the moment going down.  It gets ugly.  Tony in New York.  Hello.  Mac, I love you.  Love the show, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this.  I love it.  You couldn't even commit to it as a, as an actor.  I had to say, man.  Yeah, just to kind of like, uh. 
[00:35:00]  To get myself into a new character, because I couldn't, as myself, say that.  Yeah.  Love you.  Love the show, man.  See, Ant was acting as a, uh, a caller to a talk show.  It was so hard to say that, and I hate the thought that he might actually use it as a  promo.  Of course he will.  Of course he will.  Ah, look what they're saying about me.  Yeah.  If I suck so much, why did Anthony say this?  Because I wanted to be on the phone, and your screener told me to say it.  Man.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this, uh, Britain, uh, situation with the, uh, sailors 
[00:35:30]  that were taking, uh.  By the way, this whole time, I'm, I'm looking at Ant like, oh my God, this is perfect, perfect  set up.  You're bringing him in.  Yeah.  And then Anthony's gonna just right hook him.  Bam!  That, let me just spell out my strategy.  Get him on the phone.  Obviously that worked.  Uh, give him his, uh, screener compliment.  And then, uh, throw out an intelligent comment that he would, like, want to sink his teeth  into.  And then blindside him with my comeback after he's done, uh, commenting on that. 
[00:36:00]  Because there's nothing worse.  You could call up, someone could call up and say, hey, you're a douchebag.  Or, hey, it's O&A, why don't you talk to us?  Uh, it doesn't have the same impact as when you fake them out first.  Actually get them on a subject that they're like, wow, this is good.  And then you broadside them.  That really hurts.  So there I was.  All right.  And Jimmy and I are just looking at Ant going, wow, he's doing really well. 
[00:36:30]  Here it goes.  Here comes the knockout punch.  Any second, any second, here comes the knockout punch.  A hostage, as I see it.  Uh, there's a problem.  Um, I don't see the president, uh, speaking out on this.  And now I'm hearing that the United States has been told not to comment by Britain because  of the, uh, worldview of our country.  Uh, the British are telling us to please stay out of this so as not to make trouble.  I see this as, uh, maybe Britain turning on us a little bit, uh, as an ally, um, in this 
[00:37:00]  situation.  What do you think about this?  Well, I think that's a, well, I think that's a brilliant thing.  I think that's a brilliant question.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  I think we need to keep our nose out of it right now.  I think we got all, we're like that, uh, that, well, Sam Kilders knew this pygmy woman  in Uganda.  She's a nice girl.  She's always sticking her nose in people's business.  And I think we need to keep our nose out of everybody's business right now.  And, uh, I think, I think England is saying, look, let us handle it.  And I am okay with that for now, but you better believe if it starts to hit the fan, once 
[00:37:30]  again, we'll be there.  To save him.  It's the man cow show.  That's right.  You heard.  Yeah.  There was no knockout punch.  That's what you heard.  I gave him a good call.  I was helpful.  We learned later on that, uh, someone like tipped him off and that's when he put Anthony  on hold.  So, uh, there's no interaction anymore.  Put me on hold.  Pussed out.  So I couldn't say anything else. 
[00:38:00]  I was taken off the air.  I wanted to come back then.  And that's why I kept the dialogue going a little bit.  I wanted to come back and have another comment.  And that would have been the blindsiding part.  But it ended up just being a good call.  I gave him a good call.  Too bad he didn't come back on.  You could have yelled, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey.  Yeah.  What an ass.  Oh, my God.  And me and Jimmy just were, we couldn't even look at him.  Everyone was just staring at each other in silence like, what just happened? 
[00:38:30]  So, uh.  And I said it yesterday.  I'll say it again.  It's like calling up the bowling alley and going, hi, do you have 10-pound balls?  Yeah.  People enjoy bowling with them?  Just.  Good.  Thank you.  I'll be down.  How much for shoes?  No punchline to your prank call.  There was nothing.  It was helpful.  I helped him by giving him a good call.  Yeah, well.  And he complimented me by saying I had a brilliant point. 
[00:39:00]  Well, then, uh.  And then this went down right afterwards.  Man, go.  F***ing cut me off.  I knew that was going to happen, too.  Yeah, you should have just, uh.  You should have done him in the middle.  It was tough, though.  It was actually a valid question.  I was waiting to come back.  That's why I said, do you?  Like, f*** like that.  Wouldn't it be funny if Anthony just became a caller to the Man Cow show and never confronted him?  That's pretty much what just happened, Jimmy.  I just gave him a good f***ing call.  Way to go.  How funny would it be if someone overheard that and thought he handled such a, like, this is what we're looking for. 
[00:39:30]  And all of a sudden, we were fired.  And he was put on in every market.  Thanks a lot for nothing.  That's brilliant.  Let's say hi to Jim in Jersey.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Listen, love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  After that call, listen, the first thing that came to my head was, down goes Konya.  Down goes Konya.  No.  I waited too long to pull the trigger.  I was a sniper.  I had someone in my sights right there. 
[00:40:00]  And you didn't take the shot.  At the last minute, I was just ready to squeeze off the trigger, and they ducked back into cover.  A truck goes by.  Yeah.  Something happened where I just, like, you saw the trigger being pulled back, the tension on my finger, and something got in the way.  And then, at this point, the pest just piled on and just beat the hell out of the screen or beat the hell out of the show.  Yeah.  And we were tipped off that he was tipped off, and that's why he put you on hold. 
[00:40:30]  He didn't want anything to do with us.  Yeah.  Another pussy boy in this business, by the way.  So then we got a hold of the screener, finally.  We kept calling back for a half hour, but the pests were also calling, so there was a busy signal.  And we finally got through to the phone screener here.  Mancow, what's your topic?  Hey, listen, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Why don't we do this like gentlemen?  And why don't you get Mancow on the phone so we can talk a little bit.  Tell Mancow to get on the phone.  I would stand right next to him.  Believe me, I'd put him on the phone, but I'm in a different location here in the network.  You can tell him. 
[00:41:00]  No, you can tell him.  You've made my f***ing day great.  Tell him we're on.  I'm going to tell you that, Mike.  Why don't you tell him that we want to talk to him right now?  You have the ability.  Believe me, a phone screener can talk to the host.  Oh, absolutely.  So tell him we want to talk to him right now.  Yeah, just about his comments to Inside Radio.  Yeah, just tell him we want to talk.  And then if he doesn't want to talk, then so be it.  But at least give him the option.  Give him the option.  Don't you make his decisions for him?  Well, let me just tell you guys.  You've made my last half hour here a living hell.  Yeah, the pests are fine. 
[00:41:30]  And I appreciate all the attention and the gay comments, you know.  But I really don't think you guys are going to get to talk to him today.  Well, why not, though?  Why not?  Why not?  Because, for one thing, he's not here.  For the second, I really don't have him here.  We're talking to a huge audience right now.  I know.  And Mankow has been, Mankow is another pussy that just dodges people.  He's been writing awful things about us in the press, so let's have some fun.  Let's talk it over.  Put him on the air.  Come on.  Just put him on. 
[00:42:00]  Tell him we're on and we want to talk to him.  You know, thank you guys for putting me on XM.  I really appreciate it.  Dude, see, this is what you deal with in radio.  Phonies.  That's it.  A bunch of phonies.  We try to even be civil.  A bunch of phonies.  And there you go.  That was the response we got.  There you go.  A call screener that can't contact the host.  There you go.  I'm not even in the same location.  You're the call screener.  Aren't you able to tell the host what calls are on the line? 
[00:42:30]  And then, you know, this whole story made a bunch of radio websites yesterday.  And then they got a hold of Mankow later in the afternoon.  And once again, all brave in print.  But he had the opportunity to go on with us yesterday.  Yep.  FMQB, Mankow shoots down Opie and Anthony challenge.  Opie and Anthony have sent a challenge to Mankow.  Give back all the money he made as a shock jock.  The challenge comes after the duo read statements in an interview with Inside Radio where Mankow  is promoting his new foundation for responsible radio.  In the interview, Mankow says Opie and Anthony are failing miserably. 
[00:43:00]  They're in last place in Chicago.  And I told Joel Hollander to his face that would happen.  These are no-talent individuals and they cannot survive in a post-Janet Jackson or post-9-11 world.  We explained how we are surviving.  You heard that, hopefully.  Flaunting his new political-style show within election year just around the corner, Mankow  added, how moronic is it that Opie and Anthony would be your morning show?  There are radio people who could do this job because we know this art form.  During the XM satellite radio portion of today's show, the duo went off on the statements and 
[00:43:30]  Mankow's recent departures from Chicago and Des Moines radio.  They also attacked his use of stage calls and guests, including once using Jim Norton  to play a child molester.  Well, it was a rapist there, Mikey.  Not a child molester.  We were off for two years.  We came back and got back more markets than when we left and we got satellite radio and  he's calling us failures, said Anthony.  Later in the program, Anthony called into Mankow's show, posing as Tony from New York and  wanting to discuss the Iran-Britain hostage situation.  He was put on hold after being told by the screener to start his call by saying, Mankow, 
[00:44:00]  love you, love your show.  When Anthony was put on the air, he blew his opportunity to open dialogue with Mankow.  Thanks.  About the inside radio quotes by actually sticking to his calling topic.  I know, that's really funny.  Everyone's in shock, like, what the F?  When I read that, I started cracking up.  I'm like, I did.  I just stuck to my topic like a good caller.  And he was dropped before he could say anything else.  What an idiot I am.  I was very interested in my topic.  While ONA said the call was allegedly dropped because someone tipped off Mankow about the 
[00:44:30]  true identity of Tony from New York, FMQB has learned that Mankow had no idea the caller  was actually Anthony.  That is such BS, by the way.  Opie called back later as himself, but Mankow's screener wouldn't put him on air, telling him  that you've made my last hour here a living hell.  When Opie brought up that a huge audience was listening, the screener replied, I know,  I've just talked to half of them, all 50 of them.  Oh, we get it.  He then told ONA, thank you for putting me on XM. 
[00:45:00]  I really appreciate it.  The screener then hung up.  Soon after, Opie said, Mankow's a pussy boy.  Yep.  How else would you describe it?  For not taking our phone call.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because then we called back a bunch of times.  He had the opportunity to go, you know, face to face on the phone at least.  Yep.  And he chickened out just like Dyson, just like the rest of these fucking...  Oh, well.  I certainly hope Al Dukes is down the hall. 
[00:45:30]  That's right.  When potty mouth Opie hits the mic, Al Dukes better be sharp on the button.  That was a very responsible radio.  I'm sorry.  I say he's a pussy boy.  You know, I might have to support this Foundation for Responsible Radio.  What if kids are listening?  Kids listening on Opie's potty mouth.  Here's the update, by the way.  See, then he gets brave again because, you know, he's safe behind a computer or, you know,  away from us.  Mancow was unavailable for comment immediately after his program due to personal reasons. 
[00:46:00]  I'm an ass.  But he contacted FMQB later in the day.  When asked about the call by Anthony, he confirmed he had no idea it had even happened and reiterated  his disdain for the duo.  That's just a flat-out lie.  That's a lie.  We do a radio show.  If something like this happens, you would find out immediately that it was like someone  trying to mess with you.  Oh, come on.  You know me, the caller that you called brilliant.  And then here's his quote.  I don't want to boost a career that is over by letting them attach themselves to my star. 
[00:46:30]  A career that's over?  Star?  Jeez.  Unbelievable.  We already explained that, too.  That guy's delusional.  We're in a bunch of major markets across the country and on XM Satellite Radio.  He doesn't even come close to this.  The fact is they're over.  Over?  Voyeuristic, stupid radio is over.  All over the country.  Right.  You dope.  Ten-town idiot. 
[00:47:00]  The fact is they're over.  Voyeuristic, stupid radio is over.  I'm not going to boost them up by getting into a fake radio battle.  A fake radio battle?  This is a real issue.  He'd know fake.  We effing hate you.  You're a pussy boy.  Yeah, this has nothing to do.  You're a coward.  This is not fake.  Man, coward.  Ooh.  Their ratings are awful all over America.  They want to start a fake radio battle and I'm not interested.  It's not a fake radio battle.  These are real issues.  And first of all, you're not interested. 
[00:47:30]  We didn't bring this up, you idiot.  You're the one that went to Inside Radio and commented on us and started throwing out a bunch of lies about us.  We're not supposed to respond.  And then when we respond, they want to actually talk to the guy.  He pussies out, doesn't take our call, and then says, I don't even want to have anything to do with these guys.  You don't want to have anything to do with us.  You're so brave when we make the news for doing something outrageous and you have no problem going on Fox News Channel there and just trashing us and saying just amazing lies like you've met us and you've talked to us and we're just awful human beings when we're not doing our radio show. 
[00:48:00]  You don't know any of that crap.  But you had no problem doing it on TV and you continue to talk about us when our name pops up.  But you don't want anything to do with us?  Dude, he's over.  He's jealous.  No one ever contacted him about taking any of the slots that Howard had.  No one ever contacted him.  He was the one that was bragging to the press.  Look it up. 
[00:48:30]  Punch it up on Google.  He was bragging to the press that he's the one that's going to be taken over and no one called him because no one wants him.  He got thrown out of Chicago.  He's been thrown out of L.A.  He was thrown out of Des Moines.  The guy has 10 towns left that he's broadcasting from.  No one even knows where he broadcasts from.  He does a podcast.  It's just the guy is on the downslide.  He's done.  He had his moment.  Listen, if you can't come back from that situation, you're done. 
[00:49:00]  We were off, like I said, we were off for two years, two years without being able to utter a peep on regular radio.  And we were able to come back.  And satellite radio.  We weren't on regular radio for over four years.  Yeah, for over four years on regular radio.  And we come back and we're in major markets.  Reinventing ourselves every day, by the way.  You're in small towns and you're calling us failures?  And then he finishes by saying, and he could have done all this right to our face, by the way. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, do it on the phone.  We were right there yesterday.  We take on all challengers.  Just a phone call away, douchebag.  I get to work on a radio show, he says.  The best radio show in America.  And I'm not calling other radio shows trying to get attention.  No, you're just babbling about them in print articles.  And on TV, when you get the chance.  Because you know, wow, I finally get to show my face.  Not because it's something you're actually doing.  You have to talk about us, you douche. 
[00:50:00]  It's so pathetic.  I'm out of it.  I'm done.  Have no desire to be part of that, even a little.  And then it goes further.  FMQB contacted us and contacted him.  Said, look, why don't we discuss this?  Why don't we just discuss this?  And FMQB was going to write about it.  Get us on the phone with a moderator.  And we were going to talk voyeuristic radio, shock jock radio, responsible radio.  And we said, yeah, no problem.  No problem.  We'll kick his ass with our intelligence.  Get some facts. 
[00:50:30]  No problem.  And guess who pussed out?  Guess who pussed out?  Man.  Guess who pussed out?  Old pussy boy.  That's right.  You're a pussy boy.  Boy, in my neighborhood, you know, you call someone a pussy boy.  Ah, those are fighting words.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you going to do about it?  Nothing, because you're a coward.  Pussy boy's fighting words on the Upper West Side?  Oh, that's where I live now.  But I'm, oh, oh, okay.  I'm from the mean streets of Centiport or Long Island. 
[00:51:00]  I'm in Centiport.  You know, some of these clamors, you know, they got a little scary when you met them  in the bars and stuff.  He said, pussy boy, and some effeminate man hits you with his poodle.  For associating him with that disgusting thing.  He's a coward.  There you go.  Yeah, that's obvious.  So, you know, that right there is just, it's proof of so many things. 
[00:51:30]  It's so telling.  From him not confronting us to this call screener having to tell the listeners to say,  love you, love the show.  That right there is just so embarrassing.  To listen to was like, when he said it, I was stunned.  And then to hear a call or the first call that popped on actually say it was beyond us.  We all lost our minds trying not to laugh out loud just in case the screener was listening  in.  But we were all like, we had our hands over our mouths. 
[00:52:00]  We were laughing so hard.  More phony radio.  This business is filled with phony radio.  But voyeuristic radio will always be around.  Yeah.  Mark my words on that.  It doesn't mean.  Way past our careers, voyeuristic radio will continue.  And let me tell you, voyeuristic radio isn't let's get a woman up here to drink so much  water that she drops dead that isn't voyeuristic radio.  You don't have to go from one end of the spectrum to the other.  There's a happy medium between doing a diverse radio show that includes some things that are 
[00:52:30]  a little shocking and sensational and other things that are informative and fun.  You know, it's a well-balanced show.  But he's coming out and now he's going to be the voice of authority of what should and  shouldn't be on the radio.  Go screw.  Man, Cal.  Love you.  Love your show.  Hi, Man, Cal.  Love you.  Love your show.  Hey, Man, Cal.  Love you.  Love your show.  Love you.  Love your show, Man, Cal.  Man, Cal.  Love you.  Love the show, man.  Hey.  Why did he have to be the last one? 
[00:53:00]  I was a caster.  I was doing caster like Mr. Iners.  We had an incredible week of radio.  We took on a lot of people this week.  And we'll continue to take on a lot of people.  You know?  Yeah.  Some people, they call up, what do you?  We do it because, you know, they're talking about us in the press and we're not going to just  lay down and take it.  Sorry, we're not.  Yeah, we don't just jump on people out of nowhere.  Well, Steve Harvey.  Oh, no.  But that was an article, too.  No.  That started with a dumb article, too.  He challenged everyone. 
[00:53:30]  Department of Funny.  He said no one could beat him in the Department of Funny.  That's right.  So, we were dragged into that one as well.  Mm-hmm.  So, there you go.  I say it again.  Mancow is a coward and he's a pussy boy.  Kurt Russell on the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to Chicago.  They're getting some attention today, obviously.  Good morning to Boston today. 
[00:54:00]  They're getting some attention, and I want to say good morning to Providence.  Ooh.  They're liking the show up in Providence.  They're motivated at the radio station, and they're like, hey, talk about Providence.  Give us some stuff to talk about, and we will.  Did we say Chicago, too?  Yeah, we did.  They're very lovely.  Now that it's spring, I think we want to make a visit to Chicago, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, we kind of steer clear in the winter.  Sorry, Chicago, but damn, you're cold.  Yeah.  Oof.  Good morning to Chicago and Providence and Boston. 
[00:54:30]  And Buffalo.  Oh, yeah?  A couple truckers made the drive down from Buffalo to New York just to say hi to us.  So that was pretty cool, too.  Story of the month.  This is the last day of the month.  We started this bit, obviously, in early March.  Mm-hmm.  Something we want to do, but we started with the doozy.  Yeah, it was a good one.  So the bit kind of fell by the wayside as far as the first month goes.  Very hard to top it.  Yeah.  This is your story of the month.  We have one last chance to beat out this story, by the way, that we're going to get into. 
[00:55:00]  But here is your story of the month.  The arrest itself of a middle school principal selling drugs out of his office.  Well, that's unbelievable and bizarre enough.  But what we've learned tonight, some police sources say, is shocking.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the circumstances of his arrest.  But it's the circumstances during the arrest of 50-year-old John Ossera that makes this case incredibly bizarre.  As we first reported, police arrested the Nitschman Middle School principal on drug charges at his office Tuesday night. 
[00:55:30]  But that's only part of the story.  Tonight, police sources tell me cops were shocked and in disbelief when they stormed his office.  Sources say not only did they find drugs, money, and a pipe, they also found Ossera completely nude and watching gay porn with sex toys in his possession.  There's your story of the month.  That's great.  We're going to attempt to beat that this morning with good old Bradley.  We meet Bradley today. 
[00:56:00]  Let us meet Bradley.  Coming in just under the wire.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  It has potential.  We get to meet Bradley.  Bradley rules.  Yeah, we heard a little bit of this during the break.  But the clip I didn't play for you, oh, it's a good one.  Bradley Bernstein is 48 years old.  But his parents still call him their baby.  We feel that we were chosen to have rats.  And to give him what he needed in his life. 
[00:56:30]  So far, so good, right?  It's nice.  Caring parents.  You know, past life Hitler.  Huh?  Well, they don't know that yet out there.  You can tell, like Jimmy said before, you can tell just by the kind of a setup that he didn't just win a chess championship.  So far, all I know in Radioland is that there's some caring parents out there with a kid that's a bit slow.  They were chosen.  And they were chosen to have this type of kid.  And they love Bradley. 
[00:57:00]  And he's 48 years old now.  And they still call him their baby.  So, so far, so good, right?  But that never says intellectual superstardom when a story starts like this.  Yeah, you kind of see where this is going early on.  The word Mensa is not going to be used anytime soon.  No, no, no.  Does what he needed include electric shock?  Because for nearly 40 years, the Bernsteins have been using a cattle prod to shock their son.  She said they were chosen to be his parents. 
[00:57:30]  She didn't mention it was by Con Ed.  Oh, guys, you know, Mancow is going to be calling Responsible Radio.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful.  No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  The, uh, the cattle prod they're using?  For 40 years.  For 40 years.  Bradley, stop eating the crayons.  Bradley, stop talking.  My show is on.  Bradley, those socks don't match. 
[00:58:00]  Bradley, step away from the family photograph.  Bradley, you didn't finish your bowl of paint chips.  Bradley's an ass.  Bradley, how long have you been the producer of the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:58:30]  Bradley, that's not a shoe.  It's the cat.  Bradley.  Bradley, stop petting that small dog with that shovel.  Smack Bradley's face. 
[00:59:00]  Poor Bradley.  For 40 years, the story continues.  You see, Bradley is severely autistic and mentally retarded, diagnosed at age three.  He lives in a group home, only speaks a few words, and spends much of his day rocking in a chair with the lights out.  His parents tried psychotropic drugs, restraints.  Then someone suggested the cattle prod.  Someone.  They insist the only thing that stopped Bradley from beating himself.  Huh?  Why so vague? 
[00:59:30]  It's just someone suggested a cattle prod.  I'd hit that boy up with a cattle prod.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Sounds good.  Was it like on a list of suggestions, like our son, he rocks, he can't communicate.  Well, did you try a Ritalin?  Yes.  Cattle prod?  Cattle prod.  Someone.  Did you try backing over him in the street?  Someone suggested backing over him in the street.  For 40 years, they had a car in the living room, and then run him over whenever he talks when the programs are on. 
[01:00:00]  Someone suggested the cattle prod.  They insist the only thing that stops Bradley from beating himself bloody, like many with autism do, is a sudden zap.  It makes him forget he was hurting himself.  Really?  It gives him a new hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Ow.  His parents should be cattle prodded.  I'm fine here, and you're cattle prodding me.  Well, I like hooky. 
[01:00:30]  Well, Bradley's mother uses the prod on herself.  Oh, no.  Can you show me what it feels like?  Do it again.  Woo.  It's not something that's going to kill anybody.  Woo. 
[01:01:00]  Woo.  Woo.  She gets a little thrill out of that, I think.  Where is she using that?  Well.  Can you show me what it feels like?  Woo.  Do it again.  Woo.  It's not something that's going to kill anybody.  This portable prod shoots 4,500 volts of electricity into Bradley, as often as several times a week.  But now the state of Illinois says no more.  It passed a law last year making electric shock illegal in community facilities.  So Trinity Services, which operates Bradley's group home, has stopped using it. 
[01:01:30]  Yet decades ago, Trinity's Art Dykstra and other experts agreed a jolt of electricity was the only answer for Bradley.  Dykstra wasn't aware the treatment continued this long until just a few years ago, when Trinity took over the home where Bradley lives.  It was supposed to be temporary.  My goodness, it wasn't meant to be carried on for 30 years.  30, 40, they said.  Here's the thing, though.  Bradley, if after 40 years, if you can't just show him the cow prod and say you know what's coming, he's a dope. 
[01:02:00]  He really doesn't.  You've got to actually hit him with the damn thing.  When your cat's doing what you don't want to do, after a week, if you hold up the little spray bottle of water, the cat's like, all right, I get it.  I'm out of here.  He's dumber than a cat.  A dog will poop on the rug until you smack his nose a few times, and then he's like, all right, hey, I've got to go outside.  Yeah.  40 years later, Bradley's like, what is that thing?  Is that candy? 
[01:02:30]  No, Bradley.  Do we have to do this again?  Again, Bradley.  Anyway, this is a fine clip you're about to hear.  Bradley's parents think they should be able to use the cattle prod and continue using it.  The reporter allows them to shock her.  Really?  Yeah.  Please, God, please be in a tub.  The law should say, yes, Bradley can use the shocker. 
[01:03:00]  It needs to be used on him.  Screw the law.  Fran and Bob Bernstein argue their son can still be shocked based on this agreement from 1987 with the Illinois Department of Mental Health.  The department won't comment, but the agreement allows Bradley to be treated with electric shock.  The Bernsteins still use the prod when Bradley is visiting them at home.  The new law doesn't prevent...  Why the hell would he ever want to go back home?  Yeah, why don't I go home? 
[01:03:30]  No, I don't want to go home.  John on PalTalk, I've got to credit.  I've got to credit John on PalTalk.  Yeah.  Bradley, stop licking the electric outlets.  Bradley just wants a...  Bradley just wants a little birthday gift or something, and he's scared crapless to go home.  Poor little bastard.  One wrong move, and...  Geez.  I hate to look at his pockets.  Chewed gum and lint.  Bugs.  Cat turds. 
[01:04:00]  And a hat.  The reporter's about to get cattle prodded.  ...prod when Bradley is visiting them at home.  The new law doesn't prevent that.  Bob says he shocked his son just two weeks ago.  But at his group home, attendants now restrain Bradley or give him a drug to calm him.  Fran still calls the cattle prod the most humane treatment and convinced me to try it.  I'll try it just for a second.  Oh!  Oh, that's not horrible.  It's not pleasant. 
[01:04:30]  No, but is it horrible?  No.  God, the mom is a sick one.  Yeah, you like that, don't you?  Yeah.  They have one cattle prod.  It's got, like, two ends on it that two people can enjoy together.  Double dong cattle prod?  Look, man.  We keep shocking till the heinies meet.  How could you do that to your own child?  That's...  Come on.  It might...  I don't know.  Like, in a case of autism, though, man, a shock might be the only... 
[01:05:00]  If it does stop him from hitting himself, I mean, you know, if it works, I mean, what  else do you do?  Yeah, if he's pounding himself in the face, what do you do?  I know.  He'd laugh for a little while, of course, but then what?  But the mom's not even affected by it.  This old couple probably tried, like, at first to hold his hands away, but he's got  that, you know, that strength that they tend to get.  And what's an old couple going to do?  He's 48 years old.  Maybe they had no other course action.  Yeah, let's go to...  Shock them.  Let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's going on? 
[01:05:30]  Hey, this is it.  Story of the month.  Just hands down.  It is pretty good.  You think this beats the meth dude?  Oh, yeah.  I'll say yes, because the meth dude is a one-time incident and a crazy dude.  This is a 40-year ongoing thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I say no.  I say if we heard from Bradley and we get to hear Bradley getting shocked, then you're  talking.  Bradley.  Then it takes the title.  Bradley was like Edward Norton in Fight Club in the scene where he's in the boss's office.  Oh, wow.  He's beating the crap out of himself.  Yeah, right on.  He's got to hit him with the cattle prod. 
[01:06:00]  So there you go.  Is that the story of the month?  Shock the dummy.  Shock the dummy.  Hey, that's irresponsible.  Shock the dummy tonight.  That's irresponsible.  Good zapping.  I don't know.  That is a good story.  That could beat out the drug dealing principal.  Naked.  Gay porn.  Taking care of himself.  Gay porn.  Marital AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  We got to step aside again real fast.  Yeah.  We got to catch up because is he here?  Kurt Russell?  We're going to talk to Kurt Russell next?  Here.  Rumor has it.  In the new movie Grindhouse?  Yeah.  New Tarantino film.  That looks good.  Does that open today?  I don't know, actually.  I know the skating flick opens today.  And the reviews in the New York papers are very schizo.  One's giving it three stars.  The other's giving it like a star.  Like, where's that movie?  Is it going to be funny?  Oh, the Will Ferrell movie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And John Hedder from Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah.  What?  So he'll be here shortly. 
[01:07:00]  This is a new Tarantino film.  We have Tarantino next week, too.  Yeah.  On Tuesday, I think.  This looks cool.  I love the retro trailers for it.  Like, brings you right back.  Yeah.  See the trailers for Grindhouse?  It's great.  It looks like the old, like, early 70s movie trailers.  Yeah.  Action.  Suspense.  Drama.  All right.  We're going to play a Stephen Lynch song as we go to break.  Can we play my favorite, Special Olympics?  Mm-hmm.  Can we play it on this side of the show? 
[01:07:30]  Are they going to dump out?  I don't know.  What happens?  I think it's okay.  It's not marked.  All right.  Hopefully they don't dump out, because this is a fine song from Stephen Lynch.  We used to play the whole thing back in the day with no problem.  Be on it, Al.  Al, let it go.  Just let it go.  Let the people have a little chuckle out there.  Poor Bradley.  I know.  Believe me.  I don't want to be shocked.  God, we should be able to shock the staff with a cow prod.  Oh, wow.  That would be fun.  Every time you wear a short shirt. 
[01:08:00]  I don't like that idea.  No, it's going to be shocking me.  Red's a little dad.  Every time you smell like garlic, and I can tell on my way up the elevator,  Steve is a garlicky Lebanese.  That's all right.  I don't know what I had.  I don't know.  Hey, we got a funny coming in.  A clothes.  It's Richard in Jersey.  Richard.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Bradley.  I'm a substitute teacher in a public school system in Jersey City, 
[01:08:30]  and I could use that cattle prod with these little animals,  if you know what I mean.  Shwoogies.  All right.  Why?  How do you turn a story about Bradley and a cattle prod into a racist thing?  How is that a teacher?  Why does it always have to go back to the racist thing?  Let's say hi to Eugene on Long Island.  Eugene.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Good evening.  What's up, Eugene?  Hello? 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  I'm a psychologist.  I work in a school, and I work in an institution,  and sometimes the cattle prod is literally the most humane way to get these people under control.  If you watch them get violent, they can punch walls to the point that they'll break their bones,  and they'll rip literally the skin off of their bodies and into the muscle.  And so you can either, like, you know, wrestle them for 40 minutes and then drug them for the next six hours, 
[01:09:30]  or you just zap them once and done.  They're out of it.  God, I've never heard of this, but there you go.  This guy's saying it makes sense.  Maybe they ought to call it something other than a cattle prod if it's used for that purpose.  That's what's so shocking about it.  It's like they're using something they use on cows, you know.  And they use it on cows to drop them so we can get a nice burger and a nice steak.  These people are just uninformed, and so they make it sensational.  But, I mean, you know, they've tried literally everything before resorting to cattle prod. 
[01:10:00]  How about other words for it?  Maybe something, like, a little bit more accurate, like a dumbbell stopper.  Hey, that's irresponsible.  All right, hey, we've got to take a break because Kurt Russell's in the green room.  We don't want to make him wave.  Big star, big star coming on the Opie and Anthony show.  We go to break with this from Stephen Lynch.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics. 
[01:10:30]  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy!  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics.  You're trying to take pity.  And I know full well 
[01:11:00]  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics.  At the Special Olympics.  Special Olympics!  Take it quirky!  At the Special Olympics!  Oh, you're so sick pretty.  You can sing at my wedding when I get nervous. 
[01:11:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to get right into this.  We've got Kurt Russell in studio.  Grindhouse opens next Friday, right, Kurt?  Yeah, it's, uh, they're going to unleash it on the 6th.  Yeah, that looks great, man.  It's pretty, it's, it's an amazing night.  Um, I was at the premiere in Los Angeles and in Austin, Texas. 
[01:12:00]  And, uh, you know, I think that they get ready for it.  But, uh, it's just been a long time since, uh, there's been a movie done where, where it's an interactive experience.  Where, you know, you yell at the screen.  Yeah.  And you try to not turn away, you know.  Yeah, Tarantino also, it's like, you know, he puts his name on a movie.  Uh, people are going to go see it.  It's just, how is he to work with?  Incredible.  His, his, uh, level of knowledge of, of, of the industry and the history of it is incredible.  And that's what this night is about. 
[01:12:30]  It's just, uh, a step back, uh, in time, you know, to when the double feature was what we did.  That's what makes his movie so cool, too, is like that whole retro thing.  Because he does, he kind of grew up and absorbed all that stuff and puts it in his movies.  So, as you're, if you're the same age as him or around that age, you look at certain things and go,  God damn, I forgot about that.  Yeah, and it's kind of an, it's kind of like being in his class, his film class, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  As the years go by and he keeps making movies, you learn more and more and more about film.  Yeah.  Through his, through his love for it. 
[01:13:00]  Also, like, his ability to take, uh, people, not you, for example, but someone like Travolta with Pulp Fiction,  and actually see the potential that, hey, if I bring this guy into a movie, it's not going to be a goof.  Like, what are you bringing this guy into a movie for?  In my instance, um, one of the things he said to me was, he said, look, you've got a rogues gallery of characters  and I want Stuntman Mike to be up there on the wall with them.  And, and he said, I, I just, I'm sorry, but I want to see you be a badass again.  Yeah, yeah.  I, when I read the script, I went, you know, if you're going to work for Tarantino, you, you, you want to, you want to be a badass. 
[01:13:30]  I'm for, right, right.  So this guy's a psychotic mess to boot.  So it was just, it was just a blast.  I know.  Just the clip I saw from the trailer is, uh, hysterical.  You're in that car.  And, uh, I gather what's, what's the basic gist of the storyline?  It's real.  Well, you know, there's always a sliver of morality to these, uh, grindhouse films.  And, and this one is that, um, you know, if you're a young girl, uh, going to the bar to have a few drinks and you just get a little too loose and you need a ride home, you, you, you might be making the mistake of getting into Stuntman Mike's car. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  So don't do that.  And he, he uses a car like, um, some serial killers, you know, use knives or whatever, guns or whatever.  He's, but, but it's, you know, it's, it is in the grindhouse, um, atmosphere of craziness.  It's just a blast.  Yeah.  Very retro.  You know, it's funny.  It's just, it just, it's so crazy that, uh, you, but at times it's not at times it's, it's, it's like it was then it was like, it's so, um, shocking or awesome. 
[01:14:30]  When you look at you, you, you, you, you, you're stunned for a few minutes and then 30 seconds later, you're laughing really hard at what just stunned you.  So that's correct.  I love that about this movie.  Yeah.  Nobody, nobody does that better than him.  And he, and this one's just chock or block full of that.  Yeah.  Go to a premiere and watch it.  And then like, like, oh, this is not quite what I wanted.  Like, oh, sure.  Like, you know, that happens all the time.  Every, every time you go to work, you try to do, you know, something you hope is going to really work for the audience and the style of movie that you're doing.  Speaking of premieres, really, I got a quick story, uh, Poseidon, you were in Poseidon and I was actually in the theater when you watched, watched it for the first time. 
[01:15:00]  Wait, I told this story on the air and I'm with my girlfriend and I see Kurt Russell, like you're about five, six rows in front of us.  And you're going down the aisle trying to find a seat and you sit right next to this girl.  She has no idea it's you.  I don't even know if you're going to remember this.  That's fine.  But I was observing this whole thing.  She goes, ah, that seat's taken.  And I want to stand up and go, that's Kurt Russell.  He's in the movie.  Let him sit wherever the hell he wants. 
[01:15:30]  And you were so polite.  Like, oh, I'm sorry.  And then you found another seat.  Sure.  That's okay about me.  Got up.  Wow.  And then I'm watching you watch yourself on the big screen, which I just thought was beyond bizarre to me.  I actually got to do one scene in that movie that I really wanted to do was the drowning scene.  Oh, man.  That was sick.  Yeah, I didn't see that coming.  It was one of those moments where you're like, oh, my God, they're going to kill him off.  That was the entire fun of it.  See, I liked the remake, though.  I know a lot of people, but I really enjoyed it. 
[01:16:00]  It was so close to being a really, really good movie.  And it got right to the action.  Yeah, the action scenes were amazing.  Yeah, it just went right for it.  And your scene when you drowned was, wow, it was really good.  And I think you left right after that.  You're like, all right, I don't need to see anyone.  Yeah, I just wanted to see that.  I don't know.  That's all I wanted to see.  I know there's going to be no sexy Shelly Winters up the dress shot, so watch the crowd.  I watch the crowd.  What's left?  I know how this ends.  I'm done.  I came to see myself.  Let's be honest.  And obviously, you've got to be sick of talking about it because everybody asks you about it. 
[01:16:30]  But Gilligan's Island.  Kurt was on Gilligan's Island.  I love seeing megastars on these cool little...  Oh, I did a lot of Gilligan's Island type things.  Was that your first thing, though, that you ever did?  Oh, no, no, no.  No, unfortunately, I've been around a long time before that.  Yeah, we all grew up watching you with the Disney films.  No, I started pretty much.  Disney films.  I was a little nothing.  The computer wore tennis shoes.  What will you see?  As a matter of fact, believe it or not, the weird thing about those days was when Quentin 
[01:17:00]  was getting ready to do Grindhouse, he said, I'm going to show you a night of...  We're going to have a couple movies.  And he said, I'm going to have a lot.  He's going to have an hour and a half of coming attractions.  He said, I'll really show you what it was about.  And two of them were movies, Disney movies, that I had done.  And it reminded me that...  That's right.  I used to sometimes go to the theater and you'd see a horror film or something and you'd  see a coming attraction for a Disney picture.  And they were all...  You didn't know what you were going to get.  And that was the fun of the night, too. 
[01:17:30]  You didn't know what was coming next.  Yeah.  So it was...  That night at Quentin's was really fun because I think everybody at that point, because  a lot of young people that were going to be in the movie had never...  They'd never experienced that.  They kind of really...  They began to get the idea of what this was.  We were talking about trailers for movies earlier and how they've changed over the  years, you know?  And when you see one from years ago, it brings you right back and you're just, action, suspense,  you'll be at the edge of your seat.  And the voice quality of those guys, one of my favorites is, just keep telling yourself 
[01:18:00]  over and over, it's just...  They did that.  These were the kind of flicks that you told your...  You'd seen, like, Bush Cassie and a Sundance Kid twice.  So you really knew it well.  And you told your mom and dad, we're going to go see that again.  And you snuck off to go see the picture where these versions will be violated in ways you  can't imagine.  So you could talk about it on Monday.  And the only question you had Monday morning was, did you ever look away from the screen? 
[01:18:30]  Did you watch the whole thing?  And never once could a guy say, I watched the whole thing.  I was like, no, man, I couldn't turn away when that thing was happening.  We're eating the rats.  Oh, man.  No one will be seated during the basement sequence.  What happens in the basement?  That's great.  It's a lost art.  But you know what?  It's cool.  And at the same time, I think the thing that I experienced the most that was really exceptional  was not just the detail with which Robert and Quentin wanted to do this night, but in 
[01:19:00]  Quentin's movie, it's got that Quentin Pulp Fiction feeling, which is, this is dead on.  This is dead on.  And these people aren't doing camp or anything.  They're doing the movie.  And there's an accident in that that's just, it's the most shocking thing I've ever seen.  It's just unbelievable shot.  He had a problem.  He had to cut a lot of stuff, right?  Yeah.  Well, some of it was just, you know.  Just way over the top?  Well, no.  Some of it was just, you know. 
[01:19:30]  You couldn't use it.  The director's cut DVD.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  By the way, that's come out.  Yeah, come out.  That's what's so great about the movies that come out now, because I'm sure, like, you  as an actor and directors, you get frustrated, like, oh, this is such a great scene,  and I've got to cut it to get the ratings, you know, where.  Years ago, you'd never see, though.  You would never see it, but now, at least with the DVD, you're going to see all this  extra stuff.  Well, you know, one of the things I think needs clarification is, the Night of Grindhouse  is two movies.  It's two full movies.  Rodriguez's movie is Planet Terror. 
[01:20:00]  Then there's coming attractions for movies that don't exist.  Oh, fantastic.  And then there's, you know, the next movie, which is Death Proof.  Now, when they go out on the DVD, they're going to go out separately, and when they go  to Europe, it's going to go separately.  Oh, wow.  Like, we're going to the Cannes Film Festival.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, but it can cover that base.  This is the first movie in a while I'm very excited to see.  Oh, hell yeah.  Can I tell you something?  I'm serious.  I can tell you something.  You guys are going to have a blast.  The amazing thing about this movie that I watch is that at the end of the movie, it's 
[01:20:30]  a female-empowering movie, and the women just, the two screens I've seen, they just stand  up and give it a standing oath.  Really?  Because they did not see this coming.  Oh, cool.  And it's hard to get that message out there.  But, you know, these were pictures where girls used to like to go to them because they knew  it was an excuse for the guy to, like, semi-protect them at times.  You know what I mean?  And you knew that, too.  But at the end of the day here, there's some twists on these two films.  Are you selling this as a chick flick? 
[01:21:00]  It is.  You know what?  You know what?  At the end of the day, this is a crazy new chick flick.  Really?  No kidding.  I'm not kidding.  It's kind of, well, as a twist at the end with my character that it will, for those who  loved Escape from New York and the thing and pictures that I did like that, there's some  stuff you don't see.  Why don't you just tell us the twist?  I can't.  I can't because it's just too much fun.  You guys are, I hope the three of you see it together so you can, like, elbow each other  all through it.  We will.  Girls don't like us. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  As long as Jimmy doesn't cut the bottom out of the popcorn again.  That old gag.  I have a question about Escape from New York, and this has bugged me since 1981.  Why, when Donald Pleasence is hauling you up the wall, does he have to stop your ascent  to shoot Isaac Hayes?  Just to aggravate you.  Just to aggravate you.  You are the Duke of New York.  Yeah.  You are the Duke.  Yeah, you know, just to aggravate you and make you say, you've got to get Snake up.  You know, they just hang out there while he's firing off at the president and he's shooting  he was just a...  He was the president who wore a blonde wig, so, you know. 
[01:22:00]  That's one of those movies that if it's on, you're watching it.  You know, you've got to watch some of those.  Are there movies, though, that you've made that at the time were, like, great movies,  did very well at the theater, people loved them, but you look back and they didn't date  well.  Well, one of them I just saw recently, and me and Jimmy have a love-hate relationship  with this movie.  We talk about it all the time.  Tango and Cash.  Well, Tango and Cash is a movie that was made for 15-year-old boys.  I don't know how old you guys were at the time.  It's literally made for that audience. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  It center punches that, you know.  Once you move out of that, that movie's not meant for...  No, then it gets hysterical.  And then it's funny.  And that's why, you know, it's supposed to be that.  No, what's been my experience is sort of the opposite, is that John Carpenter, I made  movies years ago, Bob Zemeckis, and I made Used Cars.  And at the time...  Used Cars.  Oh, my God.  Really funny.  Yep.  Cars.  We talk about that one all the time, too.  At the time, these movies were...  I don't...  They didn't really know what they were.  They didn't really know how to sell them. 
[01:23:00]  And over the years, the audience that has grown to love them, they're very proprietary.  About them.  I mean, they really love them.  It's like Tombstone.  They're proprietary.  Yeah.  That movie.  That, for them, is the Western.  And it's fun to watch the life that they have, because some of them, well, quite a few  of them at the time, you know, they got kind of like a mediocre release, and then there  was a lot of the intensity that just flat didn't get it.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, Big Trouble in Little China was something that critics just flat didn't understand.  Yeah.  And I kind of like that. 
[01:23:30]  And this is another movie that, you know, I don't know what this movie's going to do.  It's completely...  There's nothing else like it out there.  There won't be anything like it.  And it, you know, it's one of those movies that I know, though, the integrity is complete.  It is exactly what it's supposed to be, and like it or not.  Quentin's dialogue is great, too.  Yeah.  He can write some great dialogue where you're just like, oh, my God, this stuff is brilliant,  hysterical, funny.  And it really says something.  It always says something. 
[01:24:00]  I just...  He's tremendous to work with.  Yeah.  There's something actors do, which I read, I was shocked, too, that you were the voice  of Elvis in Forrest Gump.  Yeah.  And it's an uncredited thing, and it's like, obviously, you just wanted to do it because  you love Elvis.  No, I wanted to do it because I love Bob Zemeckis.  Bob came to me and he said, I need you to do...  That's called a favor.  I need you to do something.  Right.  I said, well, what is it?  And he told me what it was, and I said, oh, cool.  I said, let's not do a, you know, what do you call it, a credit.  Oh, you didn't want...  I said, let's let people find this out over a period of time, and I always liked it because 
[01:24:30]  people would always say, well, now, what was your most successful movie?  And I always like to say, well, Forrest Gump.  You made the most money.  Used car.  I'm such a dope...  That's one of my favorite comedies of all time.  That is one of the funniest films ever done, and people don't talk about it.  That and Hollywood Nights, I think, were two of the funniest movies nobody ever talks  about.  Well, you're wrong.  A lot of guys do.  You'll find them.  You just got to find guys like you.  Yeah, well, they say comedies, they always find, like, Ace Ventura.  People I talk to, they always mention these over-the-top, and that was just...  You know, this is a red effing car, Rudy.  I mean, it just doesn't fit any better than that. 
[01:25:00]  God, I forgot.  That was such an ass.  Yeah, that was back in the day.  79 or 80, I think, right?  Yeah.  It was Bob's second movie.  And, you know, that's the same thing.  I'll tell you what was great about working on this picture with Quentin was it had that atmosphere.  When I was doing those pictures with John and with Bob, it was just,  we were just a bunch of kids having fun, and we were just out there having fun, doing  what we wanted to do.  This picture is just like that.  We were just doing what we wanted to do.  And you got the Pied Piper leading the way who's just a savant when it comes to film. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, there's nothing he doesn't remember or that he's seen, and there's very little  he has in a scene.  Yeah.  He is a little, he comes across as a little twisted in interviews and stuff.  He's manic.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But he's always logical.  Easy to work with?  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's just a blast.  Yeah.  But he's got his own world, and he creates it on film.  Yeah.  That's the Quentin Tarantino world, you know? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, it's definitely unique.  And it's a fun one to play in.  Yeah, unique look.  Yeah.  How funny, how fun was it?  First of all, Frank McRae, for those of you who don't know, he's a big black guy.  He was in his cars.  Great guy.  He shoved the old man in the car.  He's getting in the car.  I don't want to look inside.  Just get in the mother-infer car.  He shoves it in.  Greatest bullying scene ever.  And then you being beaten up by Jack Warden.  I mean, how great was that?  With a chain in a pickup truck.  What a savage.  It was just a damn funny movie. 
[01:26:30]  He talks about it all the time.  You can't not.  It's one of those films.  It's just everything.  It was this great tasteless humor.  It was just the dead guy being driven into an exploding thing with gas on him.  Yeah.  It's a little irreverent.  Yeah.  What about Escape from New York?  We're hearing things about a remake.  Yeah, I guess they're going to.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, listen, everything's fair game.  I've watched them turn Stargate into a television series and backdrops into a couple of shows.  I don't understand why they have to remake some of these classic movies.  I don't know.  Again, I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  It comes up from time to time.  I mean, like, what was the one with Peter Falk that we all loved that they made?  And it was on the shelves for years.  The In-Laws.  The In-Laws.  I'm like, why would you ever remake this movie?  It was perfect.  Right.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, studios have different reasons.  They see something that they think they can do well with.  And Escape from New York was just an amazing movie.  Yeah, well, listen, it'll always be there.  John Carpenter's version's always going to be there.  My version of Snake Plissken's always going to be there.  Hey, they're going to have to face comparisons, so they're going to be up against it trying  to do a good movie. 
[01:27:30]  But, you know, I've done characters that were being done at the same time.  I remember when Kevin Costner and I were doing, he was doing Wyatt Earp, I was doing Tombstone.  All right, yeah.  And, you know, you go out there and you throw it out there and you see what the people think.  See what happens.  That was an odd situation.  Like, that pretty much was at the same time.  Yeah.  A lot of people got confused.  Yeah.  Like, who the hell is who?  Why don't you play the president in the new one?  That'd be great to see you as the president.  Although the greatest sound in movie history is the clunk of your bat with the nail in  it hitting that bald head in Escape from New York.  That could be the best sound.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  But when you play Snake, when you create Snake, somebody said to me the other day, hey, would  you do a cameo in Escape from New York?  You know, I don't know if I can say this, but I'm going to.  And I said, oh, fuck that.  I mean, I was Snake.  I'm not going to become the buffoon in the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll do that now in a different movie, which is like, that's part of what's fun about Death  Proof is I got a chance to take that persona, that aura, and amp it up about 100 degrees  and have a blast and turn it on its head. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It's a good time.  We got to get him out of here.  He's got to do the Today Show.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we're having a great time with you, Kurt Russell.  You guys are fine.  The film is Grindhouse.  Amazing, yeah.  Next Friday, it premieres, and it's done by Tarantino with obviously Kurt Russell and  Rosaria Dawson and Rose McGowan.  It's just, you know, actually a film I'm looking forward to.  It really sounds great.  Just keep telling yourself over and over, it's just a movie.  Only a movie.  Well, we got Quentin, I think, next week, too.  Yeah.  Oh, get ready. 
[01:29:00]  Hang on.  Yeah.  Tie him down.  Can't wait for that one, man.  Yeah, chain him down.  Yeah.  Hey, Kurt, thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  It was good talking to you guys.  Great.  It was fun.  We'll continue in just a minute.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Steve SOS, I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Milk Diva.  Milk Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, that app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  One special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, eh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman. 
[01:30:00]  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:30:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man, that was a lot of fun.  Kurt Russell rocks.  What a great guest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Grindhouse opens next Friday.  And I hope the rest of you got the douche chose for me.  When we mentioned used cars, I went, oh, I forgot about used cars.  What a zilch.  You gushed. 
[01:31:00]  I loved your reaction.  You're a true fan, man.  I love that movie.  Your headphones went flying off your head because you got excited, threw your hands up.  What a girl.  And I just, I forgot about it.  I can't believe I forgot.  It's such a, one of my favorite movies.  You keep talking about used cars.  I got to go see it now.  I saw it back in the day.  I don't really remember much about it.  I'm just going to buy that movie.  It's so wrong funny.  The funniest line in that movie is Lenny and Squiggy from Laverne and Shirley are in it  together and they play cameramen and they're filming a commercial that these guys are bootlegging 
[01:31:30]  and the girl's top is ripped off.  The hood comes up and her top gets caught in it.  And there's a live TV commercial.  They're just jumping in on a signal and her breasts are coming out.  And he goes, oh, Lenny, Lenny Squiggy goes, holy Jesus, she's caught on the hood.  Oh, don't you hate women?  And he's filming her.  And that was a great, oh, don't you hate women?  It was just so unnecessary.  Let's go to James in Ohio real fast.  James.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, James?  I guess I love you guys, love the show. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I just wanted to say to you guys, you just had Kurt Russell on.  You guys are always like whining about it.  You never have big guests on or anything.  You know, that was definitely a big guest.  Great interview, guys.  Well, the publicists out there have to wake up.  We could do interviews.  They all get scared.  You know, we go after a guest if they deserve it.  Absolutely.  But for the most part, you know, Kurt hasn't done anything wrong as far as we're concerned.  So we had a great time at the guy.  Here's what we got next week.  And he plugged a movie to a lot of people. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Monday, we got Black Sabbath.  Tuesday, we got Quentin Tarantino.  And I know we also have Rosario Dawson from this film coming up.  We have a lot of good people coming in, actually.  All right.  So we're moving in the right direction again.  All right.  Thanks, James.  I'm glad you enjoyed that.  And the worst part of today was turning on that CW News and seeing Todd Lynn and stupid  Vinny Brand on the news discussing entertainment.  I wanted to clunk their racially diverse heads together.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  No, I'll move it before. 
[01:33:00]  Vinny's there.  Vinny actually looks good on TV, which really annoys me.  It's in the jaw.  Hey, uh...  Oh, I have to say this real quick.  Yeah.  This is an important story.  Man, an unfortunate sawmill penis incident.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is this, uh...  Ugh.  The worst thing...  What a...  Yeah.  Imagine the worst thing that could happen to you.  Speaking of groin house...  Oh.  A man has been taken to a hospital in Australia after his penis and groin got caught in the  machinery at a sawmill.  Wow.  Ugh. 
[01:33:30]  Something advertiser reports that the accident is not thought to have been life-threatening,  but that there was a degree of uncontrollable bleeding involved.  Of course there was.  Folksman for, uh, blah, blah, blah, said he got caught in a log-moving mechanism on one  of the saws.  Oh.  His penis got caught in log-moving equipment.  That's a little worse than getting the zipper caught, I would imagine.  Yeah.  Just for a little bit.  How does that happen?  He must have had, like, baggy pants and started, like, to grab his jeans first or whatever. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, he probably leaned up against the part of the machinery you're not supposed to do.  And if there's any part of the body that you do not want pulled into machinery, I think  any guy would say, my groin.  Yeah.  That's it.  Take a hand or your foot or something like that.  Your elbow.  And ear.  Right.  Your penis.  Oh, you ever hear that when someone's hair gets caught in the machine and it, like,  peels their scalp back and they have to take it out of the machine and put the scalp back 
[01:34:30]  on?  That's bad.  But if you have to go, oh, my God, it's just ripped my groin area off.  Uncontrollable bleeding.  Yeah.  No crap.  What are you going to do?  What?  Put ice on the penis?  No one's going to help you.  No.  No.  Bloody penis.  Look at that.  You're done.  Yeah.  Could you pick that up, please, and put it in a baggie with ice?  No.  No.  Looks like you're just going to bleed out.  I can't do this.  I'm just going to sit here with my knees crossed, holding my own groin and going, ow, ow, because 
[01:35:00]  that looks like it really hurts.  I can't help you because people are going to think I'm gay.  I'm sorry.  You're going to have to bleed out.  Yeah.  You know how guys.  You're just bleeding out, my friend.  A tourniquet to what?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.  Could you keep pressure on this?  No.  You want me to hold what until the?  No, I'm sorry.  Look, I'm working.  Look, we got to put out some lumber.  Look, who do you want to say goodbye to?  I'll take notes, but that's about it.  I can't. 
[01:35:30]  Whoa.  Oh, please, just hold it real tight.  No, sorry.  In other news, by the way, it's on the front page of the paper.  This is disturbing.  I don't think Rudy Giuliani is going to be in the White House either.  Rudy's kind of screwing up.  You keep saying how Hillary's not going to make it and Obama.  But Rudy's coming out with some crazy crap today.  The front page of the Daily News says, Rudy and the wife house.  The wife house.  President Giuliani would invite Judy to his cabinet meetings. 
[01:36:00]  Judy.  Now, look, Hillary back in the day, she did some stuff with Bill, but she kind of, this  was her life, too.  She was in politics from early on.  Well, it kind of started a big to-do when he was going to kind of sort of appoint her  to oversee some kind of health care commission.  Remember that?  And people went crazy going, hey, she's the first lady.  She has nothing to do with that.  Keep her butt out.  And then Rudy is saying that he'd let her be in on cabinet meetings. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yes, Rudy, that's a mistake.  Yeah.  It shows you as being a little pee-whipped.  But he's also saying that she helped him when he was the mayor of New York.  A lot.  Which she'd do.  But I think potential voters don't want to hear that, you know, you're chippy.  On 9-11, he was going to run away.  Let's get out of here.  Let's leave.  Let's leave.  No, you have to go down there.  March down and look heroic. 
[01:37:00]  Listen to me.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Stupid.  A lovestruck Rudy Giuliani says that if he makes it to the White House, his wife will  be at his side to the point where she'll be welcome at cabinet meetings.  Welcome.  Well.  I don't know about that.  How about cabinet meetings in the kitchen?  That's where she should be welcome.  The kitchen cabinets.  Maybe that's what he means.  Get in there.  Be a murderer like your father.  Yes.  He's Italian.  What time is the cabinet meeting?  Well, starting right now because those dishes need putting away. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  I guess he really doesn't want to be in the White House and this is his way out of it.  Or he thinks that I'll get women because no women are going to vote for him.  No women like him.  Well, it goes on to say, when it comes to shaping policy, I couldn't have a better advisor.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  As if Judith Giuliani would be sitting in a cabinet meeting, the former mayor said he'd  be all for it if that's what she wants.  He'll go, no, I'll let my husband be the president.  And he feels very comfortable with that and he said that, you know, she really helped 
[01:38:00]  him when he was the mayor of New York, so.  And good luck.  That's a bit, I don't know.  Maybe you shouldn't be telling people that this early on in the race.  I want to welcome a new person to our Pal Talk family.  First I've seen today.  Yeah, I see you guys like.  Ray and Kay.  I see you guys just blowing off the show to take peek.  Look.  And I'm sitting here like, ah.  It's got to be said.  I know we have ADD on the show, but help me out, Henry.  It's got to be said. 
[01:38:30]  Who's the new Pal Talker?  Did you see her?  Do you got her popped up?  I don't know.  Why would Iraq show me the goodness?  Where is that queer?  Keep, Ray and Kay, keep your face on the camera for a minute so I hope he can see what you  look like and then he can see the rest of you.  Pop that up.  Look, see?  Wow.  There's no way she listens to our show.  There she is.  And she's in a little pink and white polka dotted bikini sitting on her bed. 
[01:39:00]  And wow.  Lovely.  Jesus.  So welcome.  Welcome to the Pal Talk family.  Of course, we have Pal Talk cameras here.  You know our listeners will ruin it.  And our audience will love.  There was a time we used to have a lot of hot girls in there and I think the listeners  just ruin it after a while.  Yeah, they do.  They were already like taunting her, I think.  Where is she from and all that?  She's from pretty well.  I don't know.  We'll have to get some intel on her. 
[01:39:30]  You think the other girls are getting jealous?  That used to get all the attention?  What girls would get jealous?  Well, now it's going to make all the other girls work a little harder in the Pal Talk room.  Well, when this girl gets in a bikini at 8 o'clock in the morning to show her loveliness,  she's a petite blonde.  The other girls are going to have to come to the table.  I'll do the radio for everybody.  She's a petite blonde with blue eyes and very big boobies that look natural because she looks  very young.  She's fantastic.  Where is she from?  Do we know? 
[01:40:00]  She's just in England.  She's from Pal Talk.  She's in England?  We're international.  What are we going to do?  We can't help it.  Our success precedes us.  How about the chocolate Jesus?  There's an artist who wants to show a new Jesus made out of candy.  Six-foot chocolate Christ.  Yeah, that's on the front page as well.  And our pal Bill Donahue is up in arms about that.  Bill Donahue is a man.  He thinks it's disgusting.  The only good point he raises on this one is that they would not show a naked Martin  Luther King Jr. on Martin Luther King Day or a naked Muhammad on Ramadan, which is a 
[01:40:30]  good point.  They wouldn't show a naked Muhammad any time.  Of course not, because we all know how well Islam handles conflict.  Yeah.  This is just...  It doesn't even look like Jesus.  It looks like a burn victim.  Yeah, where's the hair?  Poorly done.  Where's the hair of Jesus?  Where's the flowing locks that Jesus had?  Where's the smile?  And I guess he's got the...  Why didn't he use white chocolate?  He's got the chocolate genitals and all that.  Yes.  They pixelated out chocolate genitalia on the news. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  500 bucks for anyone who eats the chocolate penis.  Bring us...  No, you got to bring it to us.  And we'll eat it.  Oh, my God.  Bring us the genitalia of Christ.  We want the Lord's genitals, and we like some whipped cream with them.  Bring us his genitals.  Yeah.  Bill Donahue, up in arms.  We saw him on the news before we did the show, and he is very upset with the hotel, 
[01:41:30]  because apparently it's in a hotel lobby is where this display is.  They talk to the artist, and again, this is one of those instances where an artist comes  up with this thing to get a little bit of publicity, and if the news didn't talk about  it, and like the Catholic League and Bill Donahue didn't make such a big issue about it,  no one would even know about this.  It certainly wouldn't be on the front pages of the paper.  No.  I didn't even know this hotel existed in Manhattan.  It's like a no-name hotel.  This is doing exactly what they want it to do. 
[01:42:00]  It's getting the hotel and the artist some publicity.  I will say this about artists, though.  It's like they really...  They do tend to parody Christianity a lot.  Like there was that thing with Christ in a jar of urine, which was very, very, you know,  the National Endowment of the Arts.  It was called...  It was the name...  The bad name we can't use for urine that starts with the letter P.  Christ.  Yeah, and then it was Christ after that.  That's what it was called.  And it was actually...  It wasn't...  It was a photograph of him in the jar of urine, the crucifix in a jar of urine, because of 
[01:42:30]  the way it was lit.  Like that was the big controversy.  It was like, oh, it's a jar of urine with a crucifix in it.  But it was lit in a way that, like, it was golden.  Like it really brought out a light.  It kind of looked cool.  Yeah.  But the name of it was done.  Right.  The name of it was...  Just shocked you and made you go, what?  So the guy...  The artist was probably a little disingenuous.  Well, I bet you if you're an artist, it's really tough to get any attention in this day  and age.  So, you know, you go after...  You do something like that, everyone's going to know your name immediately. 
[01:43:00]  You can't do Muhammad because they'll kill you.  Yeah.  This is what happens.  The difference.  Bill Donahue's objecting and he's pissed off and Christians are pissed off.  But the bottom line is that's all that's going to happen.  Maybe somebody will deface it.  But you're not going to be stabbed like Van Gogh was in Amsterdam.  All right.  The genitals of Christ compel you.  The genitals of Christ compel you.  All right.  We want you to bring us the genitalia of Christ.  The chocolate Christ we want. 
[01:43:30]  It's at the Roger Smith Hotel on East 47th Street.  It'll be in the gallery starting Monday.  All right.  Bring us the chocolate genitalia.  It's got to snap off pretty easy, I would think.  Depends on...  It's just chocolate.  Depends if you went the African-American route or the Asian route and how easily it'll snap  off and what kind of sack you might need to carry it in.  And please, use your hands to snap it off.  Anything else would look silly.  Yeah.  It would look like little baby birds trying to feed. 
[01:44:00]  Jamie from Buffalo.  News story of the month.  Please check out the Buffalo News.  Bike path rapist DNA matches rape from the 70s.  And the guy they put in prison has been there for 22 years.  Didn't do it.  And now they found out the local hospital had samples all along.  He was probably guilty of something.  Oh, my God.  I love when people say that, too. 
[01:44:30]  Well, you know, he probably did something.  Just look at his name.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's be honest with each other.  Do you know how mad you'd be if you were in jail since the 70s or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That DNA is helping out a lot of people.  Yeah, it really is.  But, hey, we got a couple things we could do.  What else is the big thing happening?  I mean, we got...  The big thing.  The big thing.  We mentioned everything we want to be on.  On top of everything that is going on in this fine country of ours.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, whatever.  Blades of glory. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, my God.  Show's over.  Jesus H. Christ.  You know.  They're lucky.  They're lucky.  Wow.  Look, I love boobies like anyone else.  But this is going to just shut down the O.P. and Anthony empire.  I think I'm speechless over here.  One's going this way.  One's going that way.  You got to...  Dude, we got to have... 
[01:45:30]  We have to support England.  Focus.  In its battle against Iran.  Focus.  We got responsibility to our listeners here.  Focus.  This is making me think how angry I am that we're not jumping in and bombing Iran for holding  15 British sailors.  Speaking of bombs...  Oh, no.  No, don't do that.  No, don't.  No, no, no, no, no.  Do it.  No, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Do it.  Don't do that.  No, don't do what you're thinking of doing.  Yes, do it.  Queenie bottoms are slow. 
[01:46:00]  No, don't.  The bottoms are just at her upper thighs.  Don't take off the little...  Don't listen to O.P.  Pay no attention to O.P.  Someone has to be responsible here.  Turn off your screen, sir.  It's not you.  Turn off your screen, sir.  Fifty bucks if you do it.  I'd sooner drive a nail gun through my eyes.  Turn off your screen, sir.  No.  We got a responsibility to our listeners.  It's impossible.  Get Kenny in here.  It's impossible.  Get Kenny in here.  It's impossible.  The listeners want us to see nudity. 
[01:46:30]  Kenny, turn off his computer screen.  Kenny, I am ordering you not to.  There's money in it for you.  Don't make me dig.  Look, man.  She's taking the bottoms off.  How are you not going to...  Look, we got to protect the O.P.  and Anthony Empire.  You got to turn off the screen.  We're protecting the Empire.  You can cry all you want.  I have to know who...  This is my room.  I have to know who's in here.  That's right.  For what reason?  Because it's my room, and I need to know.  We just have a peek, miss. 
[01:47:00]  Who's in here?  Give you five dollars.  Jimmy's just going to beg.  I'll give you five pounds.  I do believe the enemy has sent this fine specimen to shut down the O.P. and Anthony Empire.  Job well done.  You've gunked up the works.  They finally figured out how to get to us.  You've gummed up the works and Jimmy's microphone.  This is our kryptonite right here.  This is what's going to end our careers.  Stupid pal talk.  Oh, my God.  She's lovely.  She has a nice backside. 
[01:47:30]  I wouldn't mind giving her a kiss.  One of those little cheeks.  And now, look, everyone's using me.  They're going, do it for Anth.  Do it for Anthony.  Yeah, do it for us.  Why don't we just...  All right.  What else did you want to talk about?  I don't remember.  I'm a man just like you.  I'm just a man like you.  We've got to turn the screens off.  This is just not...  You're a man of God.  What are we, peers?  Well, when it comes to like...  My name's Fred. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, boy.  She's licking her lips now.  Now she's licking her webcam.  I mean...  That's attractive, Jim.  I can't help it.  That wasn't a sneeze.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  They're kind of coming down a little bit.  Just fall back and let your legs flay up in the air.  With your underpants at mid-thigh and kick your feet and go, tee-hee-hee-hee.  Tee-hee-hee.  Oh.  Oh, please kick your legs back a bit, miss.  Now we've got a problem. 
[01:48:30]  Now we've got a problem.  We lost the bottoms.  She's losing them.  You are watching a radio show, Self-Destruct.  The bikini bottom just came down below the knees.  She's a girl from England.  Kurt Russell would love this.  She's in a room by herself.  She started with a pink polka-dotted bikini.  Well, that is nowhere to be seen anymore.  She is...  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay, now...  All right, Lauren.  Wow, she really got unshy very quickly. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, well...  She's now...  I believe even Iran is being, you know...  Could she come closer?  ...affected by this, and they are releasing the British hostages as we speak.  See, this would be negotiating a hostage release right here.  Just seeing her on cam.  My God, man.  I know.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Jolly good, then.  Jolly good.  I have clear fluid in my socks.  She's working it. 
[01:49:30]  Is she a fan of the show?  Do we know anything about her?  No, she held up a little O&A thing.  Someone gave her.  That was nice.  Do you think?  She's lovely.  Does her boyfriend listen to the show?  I see it's Ray and Jay.  At least they rhyme.  I don't know.  I haven't seen Ray in the picture.  I don't know who this Ray is.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, boy.  What is she picking up off the floor?  Something.  She just leaned forward to get something.  What is she picking up off the floor?  It's probably a painter's suit she's going to put on and cover up those lovely bosom.  Yeah, I hope it's a snowsuit because we got a broadcast to the people who don't have 
[01:50:00]  the pal talk.  Speaking of England, how about that Heather Mills, huh?  She lost a leg, apparently.  All right, back to pal talk.  Oh.  A-U-T.  What does that mean?  Hot.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I think it's an ant.  It's an ant backwards.  Oh, A-N-T, ant.  What?  Oh, yeah.  The camera's like mirrored or something.  It's got mirror cam on, so it's kind of reversed.  No, but it was A-U-T, so...  It was an N.  Yeah, but A-N-T.  Yeah, but it wouldn't be...  It's ant.  Hi. 
[01:50:30]  No.  You wouldn't...  Hi.  See?  A-N-T.  Yeah, but the other way she did it was...  All right, whatever.  She's...  All right, so she can't spell.  It's okay.  She's really a man.  Someone wrote, she's really a man.  Jesus.  All right, look, someone's going to try to help us get the show back on track.  It's Brian on Long Island.  Brian.  Oh.  Brian.  Brian.  Yeah.  Hey, I just wanted to say, I wanted to bring the show back on track and say, 
[01:51:00]  picture your grandmother naked in a white bikini with pink polka dots.  I am, and she looks like this.  My grandmother has a great body for a cadaver.  Hey, uh...  She has really just taken this show and thrown it like King Kong...  Yeah.  ...throwing a subway train.  See, here's something that the enemies are going to realize.  This is how you shut us down.  This is how you shut us down.  You get the hot chicks to join pal talk and do this every morning.  Within a week, we're destroyed.  I'm going to tell my girlfriend I'm setting her on fire. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, uh, Brian.  Jimmy.  Brian, you like the Bob Saget?  Yeah, yeah.  You want to go see Bob Saget?  Yeah, sure.  I'm telling you, his stand-up is unbelievable.  He's a filthy, filthy man.  Awesome.  He's playing Westbury at the, what, North Fork Theater?  And it's, I think, three Fridays from today.  Doors open at 6.30, but you've got a pair of tickets to see Bob Saget.  Stay there, okay?  All right, no problem.  Incidentally, I have the, speaking of shows, I'm, in a couple weeks, not right now, I'm 
[01:52:00]  performing in Seattle at Giggles.  And on their website, they have me, my bio, they list, uh, Ed and Last Comic Standing,  no Lucky Louie, no Opie and Anthony.  So if there's anybody...  Ed.  Ed.  You were on an episode?  Yeah, he was good.  Jimmy was really good on that.  But it shouldn't be his only credit.  But that's what they're listing.  Whoever does the website for Giggles in Seattle is a dope.  So anyone going to that show, could you please call and just let them know that they neglected 
[01:52:30]  to mention the Opie and Anthony show?  They'll just giggle.  They'll just giggle at you.  Giggles.  Teehee!  Hey, we got the truckers there, losing their minds.  What's the problem?  Devin in Florida, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony, sweet tit.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't know.  It's all right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Hey, we'll start over here.  It's, uh, it's Devin in Florida.  Devin.  Hey, guys, come on.  It's not fair.  We don't have pal talk.  Can you describe him something we don't even see?  But you can get it.  It's free.  Just picture a blonde with very big blue eyes, a perfect body, a bit, a bit petite, 
[01:53:00]  probably no more than 19 years old, completely naked in a room in England.  Yeah.  Showing her wears.  Hey, Opie, I want to tell you guys, you guys shouldn't waste your time on that guy, man.  You guys are way above that.  You guys, you guys, at your worst, are better than him at his best.  Uh, thank you, sir.  Uh, well, no, we, uh, said what we had to say.  Do you love us and love the show?  Yeah, we said what we had to say, and we moved on.  I'm sorry, gentlemen. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't mean to cut y'all, but I love you, and I love the show.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  We're going to take a break.  Speaking of nudity, uh, there's a great little thing that happened yesterday that we never  got to.  The, uh, women who are nervous naked.  See, we have one that's not nervous naked.  No.  Over there in England, but we got, uh, a bunch of women that are nervous to be naked.  And we also got, uh, a telemarketer.  We're going to try to do a speed round, so we might have to turn the computers off.  Yeah.  A telemarketer that made death threats to people who were rude to him on the phone. 
[01:54:00]  You've got to love that.  What an ass.  That's great, because we've...  It just...  Oh, there goes the show.  For the love of God.  Wow.  If you like this show, you've got to stop immediately.  Well, uh, well, we're going to break anyway.  You want to sex it up in here?  Jimmy, put that ass away. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, Jim, that's going to get people.  We're going where?  What?  What happened?  Break.  Why are we breaking?  It's time to do commercials.  Commercials?  Yeah.  Oh, we're in the middle of a radio show?  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, well, we've all had the telemarketers, and we've...  Um, I'm sure a lot of us have just, like, cursed them out and said, you know, horrific  things.  Well, this telemarketer decided to call these people back, like, in the middle of the night  and threaten them.  Gee, what an ass.  We'll get into that, and we'll get into the women that are nervous to get naked. 
[01:55:00]  We'll do all that, hopefully, before we get out of here for the weekend.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The show has come to a screeching halt.  Do you want to explain, Anthony?  Uh, well, we have a new person on PalTalk.  We have PalTalk here.  We've got cameras in the studio.  And, uh, our listeners have cameras.  Um, where they are.  And we have a lovely girl, Kay. 
[01:55:30]  Because Ray and Kay is her name.  And, uh, she's from England.  And she's completely naked.  And, um, very hot.  And it is pretty much shut down the show.  Because it's up on every computer monitor in the studio here.  So, uh, everyone's looking.  And the PalTalk room is pushing a thousand people.  Pushing a thousand people.  Usually it's a couple hundred at any given time. 
[01:56:00]  But they all start chattering.  You know, chatting to each other.  And go, hey, turn on your freaking camera.  Or jump in the PalTalk room.  Something's going on today.  Yeah.  And she's just messing with everybody pretty much right now.  Well, I happen to be here to do radio.  So I'm going to do some serious topics.  While you guys are having fun.  There's a whole thing in Iran with Britain soldiers.  Apparently there was a confession.  There's a hijacked plane in the Sudan.  I mean, we don't know what's going on there.  Some tornadoes.  And, uh, new movies coming out.  And, uh, Brittany and Kay Fed got a divorce going. 
[01:56:30]  It's just crazy.  The divorce is over, I guess.  She's lovely.  Yeah.  Uh, well.  A hijacked plane.  Do we know anything about that incident?  Uh, no.  Uh, this girl, by the way, she's from England.  And we've got a story coming out of England where most, uh, a lot of women in England,  obviously not this one.  No.  They, uh, they're nervous to be naked around their, uh, their man.  Well, not this one.  Not this one.  But, uh, now why is that?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  We're moving on out of the portion of the show that I like to call the I can't believe 
[01:57:00]  I'm talking about this segment.  Really?  Some days it seems like that's the whole show.  But today it's about ladies, whether you're willing to get naked in front of the man.  Oh, yes.  This definitely calls for a close-up shot here.  Are you willing to get naked in front of the man in your life?  Because a new study in Britain says one-third of females think they are too fat.  To be naked around their husband or boyfriend.  See, that, that, that wrecks the relationship.  If you're not willing to be naked in front of, uh, your loved one, there's, there's major problems. 
[01:57:30]  So what do they do?  Huh?  What do they do?  The guys?  Throw a sheet over her fat body.  Guys, what do they do?  They still want to see a nude woman.  What do you think they're doing?  I mean, what do the ladies do?  Do they get undressed, like, uh, in bed?  Do they not get undressed?  Uh, probably get undressed in the dark, you know.  Wear one of those house coats and then a nightgown, like a grandma nightgown.  Well, you ask all these questions, but the news, uh, they went to the Beehive Hair Salon to talk to some women. 
[01:58:00]  Ooh, I'm sure they were lovely at the Beehive Hair Salon.  I'm sure.  It's a big grandma cotton candy hairdo.  I'm sure that's where Kay goes to get her hair done, the Beehive Hair Salon.  Yeah, apparently just kind of is kneeling now, um, in front of the camera, again, bringing nothing but silence to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:58:30]  I want to hear the, uh, the British, uh...  All right, here we go.  ...fatties.  Yes.  From the Beehive Hair Salon.  Here we go.  We're not sure if that's the case in the Beehive Salon this morning, uh, where we are joined now by Tracy Humphrey in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Why would you go to a place called the Beehive Hair Salon to get some reaction?  You're only going to get old hags.  It doesn't sound like a place young women go. 
[01:59:00]  By Tracy Humphrey in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Good morning to you, Tracy.  Okay, so this notion that women are so self-conscious they don't want to be naked in front of their own boyfriend or husband.  I don't know.  How's that playing out there?  You know what?  I asked the women here.  Now, I have a completely different, I mean, boy, people give me all different types of opinions.  What do you think about being a birthday student in front of your significant other?  Well, in front of my significant other, it's all right.  It took a little while, I have to admit, but now I'm fine with it.  So if he's in the bathroom and he's doing his own thing, you don't mind going in?  Um, not because of the nude factor, just because, you know, I just don't want to be in the bathroom when he's in the bathroom. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, God.  Not because he's doing, you know, I don't want to walk in the middle of that.  Oh, boy.  Yuck.  At the beehive hair salon where they're all yapping.  Oh, just a bunch of cackling hens, gossiping, baddies reading their magazines.  How'd you know that, Jimmy?  Because the next track says salon woman cackling. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, I didn't.  I just assumed I like salons.  Why does it take her a while?  Why did it take you a while?  That's interesting.  Why did it take you a while?  I was a fat kid.  I had some issues, so it took a while to get comfortable in the birthday suit.  That makes sense.  What about you?  Well, she's my daughter.  I guess I have to say I had similar issues, but I'm married a really long time.  Really, really long.  And it took me a long time to feel comfortable in my birthday suit. 
[02:00:30]  And I'm really comfortable now.  But I have to ask, does your husband strut around naked all the time?  Totally.  Totally.  All the time?  All the time?  All the time.  This is what women do when we're not around.  Is that the worst term ever?  My birthday suit?  It's really awful.  I always hated that one.  My birthday suit.  They do exactly what you thought they'd do when you're not around. 
[02:01:00]  They just talk nonsense.  Hackle.  That's exactly what I assumed they did.  Us magazine.  There you go.  Well, the anchor has to get involved, and he tells a joke, and boy, it bombs.  Jody, I have a question.  Jody, what was your question?  Oh, no, I forgot.  I was going to say, I got worried with Jody when she subcontracted the lighting director 
[02:01:30]  from the show here and invited him home.  Jody has special lighting at home, so when she's in her birthday suit, she's comfortable.  You know, all my cellulite dimples cast a certain kind of shadow.  First of all, you decide between hired and subcontracted.  Stupid.  Don't make that decision mid-joke.  And then they go with the awful wrap-up.  This is...  I just bounced her. 
[02:02:00]  Good for you.  Good.  I just threw her out of the room for the sanctity of this program.  And here's what you guys get.  Oh, yeah, sanctity.  After an hour.  And here's what you're going to get.  It's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  The front of Jim's pants.  Jesus.  That's what you get instead of a hot chick.  There you go.  Pal talk.  Enjoy.  Bunch of mose. 
[02:02:30]  That's it.  How many guys were almost done?  Now you're just standing there looking silly.  Oh, they're hating you.  And finally, this.  The awful wrap-up of the women who are nervous naked.  We're going to throw things back inside of you guys.  You know what?  I think it ruins the mystery.  I think you should be naked as rarely as possible, actually.  Even with your husband?  Most especially with your husband.  You've got to try and produce some kind of mystery after 12 years of marriage, right? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  So don't house clean in the nude.  I don't house clean anyway, so that's not a problem.  You don't have to worry about it.  Anyway.  They were open and honest about that, right?  They were.  That's a discussion about the nudity.  My goodness.  Maturity.  I love that.  And guess what?  They're not done yet.  We are going to try out the new.  You know, you've got to.  Whatever.  It's kind of a non-story.  It surprises me that that's going on.  I mean.  I love that.  Just the nonsense they were talking in the salon.  Just dreck.  A nightmare. 
[02:03:30]  All the stuff their husbands just tune out.  Yeah.  That's just a droning buzz to a guy.  Sounds like an electrical transformer.  What?  Let's say hi to James in Queens.  James, what's up?  Hey, it's Ace, boys.  No big deal.  It's Ace.  Not James.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Jimmy, I love you, baby.  Thank you, Ace.  Hey, I got a celebrity sighting for you guys at the old Beehive. 
[02:04:00]  Howard Stern getting his weaves.  The old Beehive.  The Beehive hair salon.  The Beehive rules.  The old Beehive.  That's where the fatzos go.  Hey, fatso.  What do you want?  A Beehive hairdo?  Fatso?  They give them a feed bag just to distract them while they're fixing their beehive.  Like Helen, my imaginary play friend.  Yeah, Helen had a beehive, right?  Beehive hairdo.  All right, and a lot of people want to know what you were sporting, Anthony, and, well, 
[02:04:30]  the answer would be there was something there, right?  Am I wrong?  Yeah, a little bit.  It was kind of five o'clock shadow type of thing.  Yeah, but five o'clock shadow-ish landing strip.  Kind of maybe you don't shave on the weekend.  Hitler mustache maybe, something like that.  All right.  Do we have time to do the telemarketer?  I hope so.  Wow.  We get distracted. 
[02:05:00]  I'm scared.  Oh, little red panties.  Yeah, let's, uh...  Such a dirt bag.  What is going on with the pal talk today?  This will kill us.  Naked girl.  How do you not, like, look at just naked chicks?  There is a thread on one of the message boards.  Is pal talk ruining the Ron and Fez show?  It was a poll.  Yeah.  Of course.  And people were like, yes.  They talk about it too much.  Wow.  I'm sure we'll be thrown on that thread.  It just sucks when they talk about things we can't see. 
[02:05:30]  Well, we brought everyone on board, I hope.  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  If you're working wherever you're working right now, if all of a sudden on your computer  monitor a beautiful naked girl came on there, what are you going to do?  Turn it off and get to work?  Like, homo?  Exactly.  We're just men like you.  Okay.  And I did...  The flesh is weak.  I did good last night.  What do you mean?  Good sex.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:06:00]  A lot of time on the trampoline.  Oh, good for you.  I almost had trouble jumping off the trampoline.  Really?  Couldn't stop.  Couldn't get off the trampoline.  Wow.  I finally did.  Good for you.  Good for you, Jimmy.  I finally did.  I just thought about another time I trampolined.  Thanks, Dan.  Appreciate that.  Thank you.  Dan and Club Soda.  The two away from the mics.  Thanks for laughing.  Now you can hear his laugh in the background, though.  I enjoy Than's laugh.  Hey, this telemarketer just losing his mind. 
[02:06:30]  Mike and Carol, the telemarketer was working for Edelman Carpet and Furniture Cleaning.  Carpet.  Police say he didn't like when people he was calling were rude to him, so he'd write down  their names and numbers and then threaten them in the middle of the night.  What a dick.  What a douche.  Doesn't he know he has the worst job in America?  People hate you.  Worst job in America.  Telemarketer's way up there.  Talk about rejection.  I don't know who.  I kind of like him, though.  That's just so...  That's something I would want to do. 
[02:07:00]  Do I see something in there?  What the hell was that?  Someone peeking in?  Taking a look?  Wow.  Do you see anything in there, Ed?  I can't.  It's too dark.  I do believe that might be our program director.  What?  I don't think I...  I see someone lurking in the shadows over there.  I see Scooby-Doo eyes.  He traipses about like a pixie. 
[02:07:30]  I think it might be him.  All right.  This telemarketer story is pretty good.  The phone call a Milwaukee man got in the middle of the night...  It was an odd voice, eerie voice.  ...was worse than a bad dream.  He said, you're going to die.  The man who doesn't want to be identified was scared for his life.  He's right, technically.  Crossed my mind that someone could be outside with a gun.  The man has no reason to believe why anyone would make a death threat against him. 
[02:08:00]  So he had the telephone company put a tracer on his phone.  Not even 24 hours later, the caller called back.  They called, got the same message that I was going to die.  A second call was someone sort of chuckling on the phone.  Har, har, hearty, har, har.  What a psychopath, huh?  Guy hates his job.  You know what it's like to be a telemarketer?  I don't.  I never was, but I can only imagine if there are anything like the calls that I get. 
[02:08:30]  Because now I just have no patience for them.  Sometimes I just pick it up.  And if you get that thing where you see an 888 number or some ridiculous number,  you pick up the phone and then you got to wait.  Because now they don't even have the common courtesy to sit there and wait for you to answer the phone.  You pick up the phone and then they must get a signal that you picked up the phone.  So then they go to you.  So you're almost on hold for a couple of seconds going, hello, hello, hello.  And then it clicks on.  And then they go, hello, is somebody there? 
[02:09:00]  And even if they're not there, you go, no, you got the wrong number.  Well, who am I speaking to?  So I usually just start going, not to hear it, not to hear it at all.  Not to talk to you.  Goodbye.  You're not doing the telemarketer voice right.  What?  No, I just do that because then I hang up and I know they're not going to call back.  Right.  I'm like a dead one.  They just kind of exit off their list.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dave in Michigan.  Dave?  Hey, guys.  I'd like to say thanks for the description on the pal talk because I can't watch a screen and drive at the same time. 
[02:09:30]  You weren't trying to drive and look at that, were you?  Yeah, but I had to call it quits.  I came into heavy traffic.  Yes, some people actually have their pal talk set up through an air card so they're completely wireless.  They set up a camera out their windshield or something and they drive and look at pal talk as they're driving.  She probably caused about 80 accidents, I would say.  And now she's gone for, what, 24 hours because you bounced her?  No, I took her bounce off immediately after I bounced her. 
[02:10:00]  What am I, stupid?  All right.  But she hasn't come back into the room.  I think she feels snubbed.  That's too bad.  I had enough of her anyway with her stupid doe eyes.  Beat it, you Brit.  Enough.  You're nuts.  Enough already.  Jimmy turns on you in a second.  Stop it.  The coy leg crossing.  Stop with your breasts.  They're both looking opposite ways.  She has two lazy breasts.  They were lovely.  Oh, my God.  They were like two dumb googly eyes looking the opposite direction.  I didn't like her stupid Marmaduke eye breasts. 
[02:10:30]  She was lovely, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're wrecking it for everybody.  That girl really didn't have a problem whatsoever.  Where is she right now?  She's probably taking a dump.  Oh, right.  Jimmy, no.  Why do you got to ruin everything that is good?  The whole house smells like a shepherd's pie.  Jimmy ruins everything that is good in life.  She left some blood pudding.  Hey, let's get the end of this telemarketing.  Here we go.  Police say the call was traced to this man, Michael Balistrieri. 
[02:11:00]  He's a former telemarketer for Edelman Carpet and Furniture Cleaning.  According to the criminal complaint, Balistrieri admitted he contacted customers who were rude to him and began to harass them.  Were you rude to him on the phone?  No.  I said, I'm not interested.  Please don't call me again.  I was terrified because you just didn't know what was going to happen next.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  So they're asking if this guy was rude to the telemarketer.  Oh.  Well, so what?  And the guy's saying no.  Even if you are, I can't call you back at night.  We have every right to be rude to the telemarketers.  It's invasive.  Huh?  It's invasive.  Absolutely.  It's invasive.  I've gotten calls at 8 o'clock on Saturday morning.  Language.  I know.  I'm sorry.  8 o'clock on Saturday morn.  And then finally.  Yeah.  And police say Balistrieri. 
[02:12:00]  What did you say?  I was just saying.  And you got to be rude to him at that point.  It's like Saturday morning.  You're out Friday night.  You want to sleep late and some jackass is calling you.  Has anything ever come out of a telemarketer calling you that was good?  No.  I have never in all my years of answering that goddamn phone and getting a telemarketer on the other end.  I have never been swayed.  I have never bought anything.  Not once, right?  I've never done one thing but be annoyed.  I couldn't even tell you what the hell they were selling me.  There was never a surprise where you're like, oh my, thank you. 
[02:12:30]  I could use that.  Oh my God.  Thanks for calling me with this.  I'll tell you something good that happened.  Yeah.  When I was living with Jimmy Florentine and he was doing these prank calls like for the telemarketers.  He made CDs.  We came home one time and the police had kicked our front door down because he was doing some forced abortion one with his girlfriend.  And people, like the telemarketer called the cops and thought like he was like, like while he's on the phone with them, he's like trying to force his girlfriend to get an abortion with a vacuum cleaner.  He's like, I don't want to.  He's like, come on.  It was really funny.  But the cops believed it and kicked our door down because I lived with him. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, that's great.  And I came back and there was obviously, you know, the door was like cracked off the hinges.  And then the police had been there and he had to go down to the police station and straighten out.  No, I'm just an ass.  I used to also have fun with the telemarketers when we were back in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Taped a few of them back in the day.  Yeah, I guess your number was on a list.  You used to get a lot of them.  I used to just pile up just a ton of like pots and pans and I would destroy all my kitchenware. 
[02:13:30]  You could hear in the background, Opie slowly stacking pots and pans.  You'd hear like clink, clink.  And he's talking, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And then he'd knock them all down and scream like something just fell on him.  The whole cabinet fell on top of it.  Are you okay, sir?  Yeah.  This is how the story ends.  And police say Balistruri made multiple death threats against multiple people.  I spoke with Balistruri a short time ago, and he tells me that he was under the influence of drugs when he made those phone calls and that he's sorry. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  All right.  He's sorry.  You're free to go.  It's okay, then.  Everyone's under the influence of drugs whenever they do anything.  That's an easy out, though.  That's a very easy out.  It certainly is.  Well, unfortunately, we ran out of show.  Ooh.  Hope you had fun listening today.  Enjoy your weekend.  Yes.  If you're not joining us over at XM Satellite Radio.  Come on over.  Say hi.  I do believe we had a fine week of radio.  Yeah, it was fun.  Oh, he's nodding. 
[02:14:30]  And a two thumbs up from John Medelli.  Out of five.  And now he's gone.  Just like that.  Yeah.  He was lurking, and now he's gone.  Guys, seriously, have a great weekend.  Thanks for the support.  Goodbye.  And we'll see you Monday if you're not, you know, taking the walk over to XM with us.  Peace.  All right.  OVM Anthony.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202. 
[02:15:00]  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Laszlo here at XM Satellite Radio today, and we were greeted with lots of merch. 
[02:19:00]  We got some swag. 
[02:19:30]  My eyes are burning every night.  They're dry.  They're red.  You know that feel, right?  Yeah, it's an ear game hangover.  The greatest one is when you play the PSP in bed right next to your chick.  Yeah.  With the earbuds.  With the earbuds.  With the earbuds.  Yeah, exactly.  She tries to talk to you like, can you see?  I am gaming now.  And with Luminous 2, it's like one more level, one more level, one more board, one more board.  I got to keep going.  My high score now on Luminous 2, my high score now on Luminous 2 is over 400,000. 
[02:20:00]  It's just ridiculous.  There's no reason to play it to this point, but I continue to play it.  Keep playing.  That level that you got stuck on Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.  I gave up.  It took me forever.  All right, thank you, because you laughed at me.  Which one?  The helicopter?  Yeah, when you try to like...  The helicopter.  The helicopter picking up the cars or whatever.  And that's what sucks, because I love Grand Theft Auto for the PSP.  I was so into this one.  You know, the whole show is all over the game, and I'm like, yeah, man.  And then I got to that level, and I'm like, you know what?  I'm too old for this shit. 
[02:20:30]  I don't need to complete the game.  I hate when games do this to me.  When you finish that level, you feel like a man.  You know, there was a level in one of the GTAs where you had a remote control helicopter,  and you had to get the explosives in the building, and that one was such a tough level,  and I barely made it out.  Yeah, a little radio control helicopter thing, and barely made it out of the building in time,  and just made after, I can't even tell you how many attempts. 
[02:21:00]  But you're right.  When you do get it done, you're like, yeah, okay, I did that.  That I can handle.  The things I cannot fucking handle in that game are the races.  When I have to race computer vehicles, I'm sorry, I can't cut an apex around a corner like these computer-driven vehicles.  I was digging that in the latest for the PSP.  You get close, and you spin out, and you're like, damn it.  You hit another car, some asshole swerves in your lane right when you're going to pass them. 
[02:21:30]  Hit a tree, and you come to a dead stop.  Yeah, and you're like, oh, and you just picture all the other vehicles way ahead of you.  With me, and I used to be, when gaming really started coming into its own, I had to complete the games, absolutely.  Yep.  But now I'm older.  I can't be bothered.  So now it's cheat codes I have no problem with.  Walkthroughs.  I love a walkthrough.  I'm a big fan of all that, and if the walkthrough gets me through a level, I don't feel any guilt, and I feel like a man, too.  Like, ah, see, I did it. 
[02:22:00]  I won't use cheat codes.  I will use all tools that are available now.  I'll do my gaming.  I'll use a walkthrough if I've been, like, sometimes days on a level where I'm like, I've been around everything.  I've poked around.  I've looked at everything.  I need a walkthrough.  So I'll peek through there and go, oh, okay, I make a left.  That's pretty much the extent of the cheating I do on a video game.  Can I tell you something?  Bob Smith just destroyed me.  What happened?  Now, I said my Luminous High score, and it's on one of the more complicated levels. 
[02:22:30]  I said 400,000, 400 and something like 20,000, and I know that impressed a lot of people out there.  I know.  I know that.  Bob just writes, oh, my Luminous High score is over a million.  I play it four hours a night.  Pumped.  Bob has no idea what he just did to me.  Over a million.  No, because I was ready to say, you know what, I'm done.  There's no way I could go any higher than this.  But now that I know that Bob is over a million, I'm fucked. 
[02:23:00]  You might be lying.  You know, dude.  Nah, you get a feel after a while that you know these guys aren't lying.  Bob's a queer.  Bob, he's got over a million.  I believe him.  I definitely believe him because I know it's possible.  But my eyes hurt to the point I can't.  I have to play the Luminous, too, in stages now.  Really?  Yeah, a half hour to 40 minutes.  I'm like, okay, good.  So far, so good.  I put the game down so my eyes can come back to normal.  You get like Arkburn, like you're a welder without a mask on.  Yeah.  You can't even see. 
[02:23:30]  But who gives a shit about all that?  The trailer for GTA 4.  Yeah, I sent Anthony an email last night.  And I had to actually wait to send him a link to it.  Because when it went live, there was like a countdown clock that went on for over a month.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there was a countdown clock.  That's a good idea.  And they even like bought time on FX and put the countdown clock on there.  Just for like half an hour of a countdown clock.  And when it hit 6 o'clock Eastern yesterday, the servers at Rockstar Games melted.  Yeah.  Melted.  And video game websites that had the trailer as well. 
[02:24:00]  You couldn't even get close to them.  Yeah.  It just melted the Rockstar website.  Well, I want to see it now.  Where's our, where's Than or somebody that can poke this up on the screen?  I finally got on about 10 o'clock or so last night and was able to look at it.  And amazing.  Oh.  They revamped the graphics.  They look amazing.  The lighting, shadows.  Yeah.  It's going to be a great, great looking game.  People beating us up.  You guys are old.  Or you guys are getting old. 
[02:24:30]  That car pickup helicopter mission was so easy.  Two tries.  I didn't.  Shut up.  Whatever, man.  There's always somebody.  You know, jackass, shut up.  There's always someone.  Dude, I got through that in one try.  You're a faggot.  Everyone's saying 400,000 on Luminous 2 ain't shit.  Great.  Now, see, I really wanted to put this game down.  I'm done.  My freaking, I feel like I have arthritis.  You played on the plane?  It's a good thing for the plane, though, right?  It makes flights go by.  All of a sudden, the captain comes on and says, we'll be landing in 10 minutes. 
[02:25:00]  I swear to God.  I'm like, we just took off.  And then my girlfriend will go, we've been flying for four hours.  Really?  Okay.  I think I'm doing Tiger Woods for the PSP for our trip out to Vegas for the O&A traveling  virus.  I wish I could get into the video games.  That's such a good way to travel.  Dude, the PSP.  And the PSP is great to watch movies, too, because, you know, you can just hold it nice.  You know what I mean?  You can just...  It's got a lot bigger screen than the iPod, too.  That's my biggest complaint about the iPod.  Yeah.  And you can't really hold the iPod.  Like, to hold the PSP with two hands and watch a movie, it's easy. 
[02:25:30]  You got a little stand, those little business cards things.  I don't know if they have a stand for it.  I have a PSP.  And you put it on that, and you can watch it on that.  You have a PSP?  You just told me out there you don't have one.  No, I have my nephew.  My nephew is it.  Oh, okay.  I actually don't either.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not supposed to read walkthroughs, because reading is for queers.  I forgot.  I'm sorry, Max, from Dallas.  Yeah, so here's the trailer for GTA IV.  Yeah, it's at rockstargames.com.  I got to see this.  I know this is a visual.  Check it out.  No, there's sound, too, which I actually worked on. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, I know.  But we don't get sound on these computers.  Why would we?  Well, why don't we get the sound for everybody?  Are these actually in-game graphics?  Isn't that amazing?  This isn't a cutaway?  Correct.  That's a cutaway.  Cudaways are for queers these days.  Obviously, Liberty City is now New York City, because that's the Empire State Building.  It looks great.  All those details, the haze, the lighting effects are amazing.  The shadowing on where they show the bridge, and the shadows on the bridge look amazing. 
[02:26:30]  This is in-this is-no, these are cutaways.  No way.  Are you-so what would be really great is if we rendered some characters and just had people  on 57th Street just doing a walkover every day at night?  Doing the walkover, yeah.  That'd be cool.  There you go.  We could beat them over the head with crowbars or hammers.  Club Soda Kenny can come up and hit you.  Derek the Dodo.  Hey.  All right, the trailer looks amazing.  Why are the graphics so much better?  Because it's, you know, the next generation of game consoles, PS3 and Xbox, going into 
[02:27:00]  the land of high def, so the graphics are at a whole new level.  And more importantly, why aren't we part of 4?  I agree.  Yeah, what happened?  They weren't impressed with what we did for the other games?  We're still working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was very good, I thought, in Bully.  Yes, you were good in Bully.  I'm a good actor.  Freeze!  And that was Whisper.  They didn't like my staff sergeant, huh?  No, it was good. 
[02:27:30]  I love it every time I get busted, because there's several cops in Vice City Stories, but  when you get busted, it's you on the ground, with Opie standing over you screaming at me.  It's really nice.  A little too real, huh?  That's really cool.  That trailer looks amazing.  Anything different about this game?  Things will be different.  That's all that I've been allowed to say.  Oh, really?  Yes.  There'll be more coming out this summer.  That's what I like about that game.  You just, you don't know. 
[02:28:00]  Then you start playing, get some new, little new things to beat people up with.  All right, we've got to say hi to Rick and Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Rick, what's up?  Gentlemen, love you, love your show.  Thank you, Rick.  Especially Jimmy.  Hi!  What's up, bud?  Hey, you guys went from Kurt Russell to Laszlo.  What's the deal?  Easy.  Rough-braining.  Hey. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, we are.  No, we love Laszlo.  Big Hollywood star.  I put all the X-Ivers get.  Why don't you pound it up your ass?  That's right.  Bob in Georgia wants to defend his Luminous 2 high score.  Bob.  Hey, guys.  Are you hit a million, really?  Yes, really.  Bullshit.  Does a game start showing your porn or anything?  If you hit a million, what happens?  Nothing really happens.  I'll start playing about 11 o'clock at night, and I'll wake up, and it's like 2, 3 o'clock  in the morning. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, my games are up to two hours long, so if you're hitting a million, that's got to  be a four-hour game, I'm thinking.  It will take me several nights to get up that high.  Fuck.  Are the blocks just spilling out of the sky at that point?  Not really.  It's just burning eyes and wondering what has happened to my life.  Same thing I'm wondering.  Yeah, I think that stuff, too.  All right, sir.  Thanks, Bob.  See, he got a million, Jim.  Bye, Angel.  Bob's full of turkey.  Your 400,000 high score is unbeatable. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, you know what I love about Laszlo?  He comes in very, very prepared.  Yes, he does.  He hands out dittos to everybody.  Yeah, I went to...  Instead of just shooting the shit, it's like, fuck that.  I got things I want to talk about.  Yeah, if you smell it and rub it on your face.  He's still got blue ink on his fingertips.  Oh, ditto sheets.  Wow.  What a great...  Dude, I really think that they should release some kind of perfume or something that smells  like those crazy old ditto sheets.  Because I know I used to pop a rod every time I'd rub a test on my face.  It's great.  Or a douche.  Take one and hand it back. 
[02:30:00]  Take one, hand it back, and then you get it and...  Oh, ditto smell.  When's your nice show, us?  This weekend.  That's why he's here.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Promote, promote, promote.  Tomorrow.  Bruce of Louisiana, is GTA 4 on PS2 or just PS3?  It's PS...  PS3.  And that's it?  And Xbox, right?  PS3 and Xbox, yeah.  And then eventually on PSP?  Uh, I don't know if the PSP could really handle this.  Yeah.  What about...  That's too bad.  ...PC?  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything about that.  Poor PC people. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, that's okay, because I'll wind up now getting...  I'll buy an Xbox.  Anthony says to me outside, he goes, you know, after I saw that trailer, you know how much  that game's going to cost me?  Yeah.  $650.  Exactly.  You've got to buy the stupid...  Can I ask you something about the PS games?  Are they kind of losing their popularity, and is Xbox taking over on PS3 at this point?  Because there was a time that it was much cooler, the graphics and stuff, on the PC  games.  Well, you don't hear about PC games as much, is what I'm saying.  It's just exclusivity now that they want. 
[02:31:00]  They're paying for the games, so...  But do you still have a lot of choices?  And there's a lot of console games out there.  Yeah, I still got a shitload of choices.  And eventually, they do end up on PC at some point, a lot of the games.  But graphically, I think you'd have a hard time getting better graphically with a console  than you can with a top-of-the-line, updated computer.  You know, a lot of people's computers are old.  They can't handle the fucking graphics of a lot of these games.  But consoles, you know, they're new, especially the new ones out now. 
[02:31:30]  They can handle these graphics.  Yeah, and the new Xbox that just came out, as well as the PS3, you know, if you've got  a really nice high-def screen, it looks amazing.  Yeah, that's it, too.  It's not like you're plugging into it.  You're getting a great video system, and you're plugging it into a television set with scan  lines and shit.  Now you plug it into your high-def television, it's like a giant monitor is what it is.  So you're getting it in full resolution.  Before we get into the Laszlo stuff here, we've got a lot of fine things to talk about. 
[02:32:00]  Why didn't anyone tell me it's Nerd Day?  It's Nerd Day today?  I had no idea.  Oh.  I didn't know it was Nerd Day.  Oh, my God.  I didn't get the memo.  There's a group of folks outside the window watching us and always implying that they're  all of one genre.  They're all of a similar ilk.  I'm more from the school of thought that one person's missing, a big Indian. 
[02:32:30]  You're not a loony boy, you're a fisherman.  Oh, that's great.  All right.  Can I throw out a quick thank you to the federal agents?  Federal agents?  I want to say their name.  Can you?  They were Homeland Security people.  Really?  Jack Power?  My wife and I.  Jack Power.  Don't get Travis all excited.  Jack Dunphy's full of shit.  He loves Jack Power. 
[02:33:00]  My wife and I saw you perform at the Ontario Improva.  It was great.  Thanks for the picture.  They were at the Department of Homeland Security and they sent me a sweatshirt and a shirt.  So thank you to my new friends.  What about our shirts?  How about to my friend Tom and your wife?  How about a couple of sweatshirts and T-shirts?  And guns.  For Greg and Tony.  We like cool T-shirts.  I wear my special ops shirt that we got.  Yes, you do.  I'm wearing Pentagon Police right now.  That's a cool one.  See, that's something I'd wear.  And I have a Border Patrol one.  These are all real shirts. 
[02:33:30]  I have NYPD shirts.  I'm afraid to wear those out.  Why?  Because then people might expect something of you if something goes down.  Like you're just in some stupid gas station pumping some gas.  You go to pay the guy inside.  A robbery's going down and everyone's looking at me like,  Excuse me.  Yeah, I hear you.  You ever look around and go,  Just my luck.  The FBI's right there.  Yeah.  Somebody runs over to Jimmy for help and he's got a Department of Homeland Security shirt on.  Yeah, what?  I'm a comic.  Do you not wear your jersey to the game because you're afraid someone's going to get hurt 
[02:34:00]  and they're going to call you in from the stands?  Call me again in here.  Could happen.  But I'm just a spelt fellow.  Just wearing the jersey.  I'm not Harold Carmichael.  So how about a couple of sweatshirts for my pals?  What can we do with the nerds though?  There's something there.  There's something brewing.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think we got something brewing with the nerds today.  The nerds.  Friday's the day, by the way, to come by and check out the show.  Yeah.  It's definitely the day to come by.  Sit out, watch us through the glass. 
[02:34:30]  I'm not saying nerd day.  I mean, they seem pretty cool.  I bet you there's some tough dudes out there.  Right?  Let's see.  The guy on the end with the Yankee hat got problems.  Yeah, he was here yesterday.  Yeah, he's a fucking wacko.  Any person that comes by two days in a row, there's something wrong with them.  Most people come by and go, this is the big deal?  All right, well, I did that.  I'll check that off my list of things to do with my life.  These guys with the glasses aren't really physically menacing, but they're the type that shoot you.  That's the type.  They're the type that shoot you in the stomach, too.  Not even the chest or the head.  Like in the workplace?  Yeah, a belly shot. 
[02:35:00]  And you roll around thinking it over while you die.  I bet you they're scary when they're in front of their computers, right?  Yeah.  And this is fucking Travis right here, if he's shaved.  This young man on the end looks like Travis with the glasses.  Yeah.  Who do you think the biggest problem is out there?  That's the game we can play.  The guy in the blue, the dark blue, looks like some kind of hooligan.  Yeah?  He looks like a soccer hooligan.  Nah, you, sir.  Don't turn around looking for anybody.  We're talking about you, the one that turned around.  Yeah, to look if there was another guy in a blue sweater or whatever you're wearing. 
[02:35:30]  Looks like a blindside you with a Guinness.  Right across the side of the head.  Yeah.  How about that fucking square-headed lunatic in the middle with the red?  He looks like a fucking problem.  Yeah, I think he's the biggest problem out there.  You think that's the problem?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's a maniac.  Snap.  Let's see if he is the biggest problem.  Dan, let's say hello.  What's your name and what do you do for a living?  Well, where are you from?  Manhattan.  All right, see, that could be a problem right there.  New York, uh...  I run by you when you walk home.  I'm usually running in the park.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  Oh, boy.  With an e-mask on.  You predicted... 
[02:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Complete accuracy problem.  He knows that I walk through the park every day to go home.  That's wonderful.  What do you do for a living?  Commodities trader.  Wow.  Are you really a trader?  They're stable.  Wow.  They're stable people in a non-stress job.  Oh, shit.  They don't usually snap, though.  They usually have too much money.  Can anyone beat that?  Anyone scarier than that?  Well, what is this gentleman in the dark blue?  Let's see what he does in his story, Dan.  What do you do, sir?  I, uh, sell body parts.  Jesus. 
[02:36:30]  Body parts?  Are you kidding?  No, I work for a company that sells hip and knee replacements.  Oh, so you sell, like, uh...  For aesthetics.  Like for arthritis.  No, his job is to get them off of live people.  Old...  Chasing old bags down the street.  I still need this.  Shut up.  So does Paul Stanley.  And who's more important?  Let's be honest.  You or Paul Stanley?  All right, how about the, uh, how about the gentleman next to him with the mouth kind  of half open, like he's watching something? 
[02:37:00]  Hi, sir.  Uh, David from Kansas City, and you called it, oh, I am a nerd.  Yeah.  I'm a computer engineer.  Oh, okay.  And me and him had at it, outside.  We do?  He says that we make fun of Kansas City a lot.  Yeah, you do.  Do we?  You trash us all the time.  Oh, you know, I like Wilbur Harrison's song very much.  But then he reminded us that we made fun of H-Cup Jane because she went and got her implants  in Kansas City.  Kansas City.  We are home of the boobs, so...  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, I don't get that.  As people, you mean.  I don't know.  Home of the boobs. 
[02:37:30]  Maybe the Rolling Hills are inspiring.  I don't know.  But really, a lot of girls go there and get their implants?  Sure.  And a lot of girls are walking around Kansas City with implants?  Yeah.  You see like 80-year-old ladies with perfect boobs.  It's amazing.  In Kansas City?  Yeah.  You see it in Florida.  You see it in California.  I would never think Kansas City.  You know what they say about Kansas City?  Everything's up to date.  Yep.  Yep.  I've heard that.  The Beatles went there a lot.  Huh?  The Beatles went there a lot.  You know what's just odd about Kansas City?  What's that?  It's in Missouri.  And Kansas.  That's true.  And Kansas.  But the popular part is in Missouri. 
[02:38:00]  Is in Missouri.  Right.  Which is the silliest thing.  Well, if you've been to the Kansas part, it's pretty much Little Mexico.  Oh, really?  It's like Tijuana in Kansas, so...  Really?  We don't want to go over there.  So you don't want to go over there.  Yeah.  How far away are they, Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas Cities?  Right across the river from each other.  It's like East Berlin and West Berlin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know which one I'm going to.  Only with Mexicans instead of people that would kill you.  You're going to it, Jimmy?  I'm performing in Kansas City.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm doing some weird markets.  I'm doing Seattle coming up.  I'm doing Kansas City and Miami.  All markets I've never been to.  Wow.  Yeah, well, we're not on commercial radio there. 
[02:38:30]  So there are markets that we don't know.  It's not like Boston or Sacramento, where we used to be on.  Like, we know Philly really well, because we've been on Philly radio for a very long time  over the years.  Well, you should come out.  We just got paved streets and a stoplight.  There you go.  All right.  Kansas City, here I come.  You like that song, right?  A little Wilbur Harrison?  Oh, sure.  I'll reference it again.  All right.  So take good care of you for me in Kansas City.  Anybody else want to talk out there?  No, no.  Another Kansas City song.  Any scary people out there?  Two men right in the front.  Look at these two.  Yeah, what do you do for a living there, sir? 
[02:39:00]  I'm a student.  Oh, yeah.  You're the local.  Where do you stewed?  I love hearing that one.  I should have suspenders and a brick wall behind me.  I should be in the shower shooting myself in the head.  Philly's beating you up, Kansas City.  Elliot writes, the Beatles went there a lot.  How cool is your city if you have to use a 40-year-old reference?  It's a good point.  It's a good point.  Taft once slept here.  All right.  It's a selling point for tourism.  Anyone else?  How about you, Sarah on the White?  God bless you. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, I got nothing.  All right.  Well, you support for this show.  Yeah?  He froze?  He looks like...  Anybody ever see Goldeneye?  No.  No.  All right.  What is it?  A movie about what?  A James Bond movie?  Maybe a James Bond movie.  One of those small under-the-radar films.  Oh, thank you.  Stop with your dead stare, Jimmy.  A lot of people saw that movie.  I didn't see it.  The thing gave you a beating.  But I didn't see the movie.  He said that they want to see Goldeneye.  He looks like the bad guy in it, so never mind. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Got nothing?  No?  Nah.  Just work at the Hard Rock.  That's it.  Oh, okay.  What do you do there?  I serve tables.  What are you?  James Bond?  Yes, you do.  You ever see Goldeneye?  How about Browneye?  That's the fucking sequel where they're both queers.  Jim's seen Golden Liquid.  All right.  Well, then there you go.  There's our studio audience.  Maybe we'll play a little game with them later.  Can we take a break and then get into Laszlo?  Yeah, I got to make Mad Yellow. 
[02:40:30]  I like the way you said it.  So do I, man.  Make some Mad Yellow.  I got to take a really, really long week.  Wicked piss.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I like some of these.  Some of these things Laszlo brought in.  Sorry about that.  Did he cue you?  Go fuck yourself.  I think the head went up.  Go to break, then.  What do I do?  Use the public airwaves to promote and profit from the sale of pornographic material.  We're smut headlers, like Anthony said.  Me and Opie.  We're counting up the filthy pornographic money. 
[02:41:00]  You owe us for the porn we gave you.  Mwahaha.  I love porno money.  All right.  So I walked to the bathroom, and a package arrived for me, you, and you.  What?  I don't know.  Why?  Open that up. 
[02:41:30]  We're going to find out live.  What version?  What's in the package, Opie?  What version of that song was that?  What's in the package?  Outshine?  Soundgarden?  Different version?  Yeah, that was actually Audioslave doing it.  Ah.  Oh, dude, you got a good ear.  I was just assuming it was, uh...  No.  Where's my package?  Very cool.  Where's my present?  It says, uh, Opie.  I hurt my mouth, thank you.  From Eric Logan?  Eric Logan?  He still works for the company?  He loves...  Rumor has it.  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Uh-oh. 
[02:42:00]  Uh-oh.  I see a major problem.  Oh, boy.  There's a paper clip.  Oh, no.  On, um...  You're kidding, right?  There is a paper clip.  Did I almost throw him away?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Uh, well, the one that says Ant is fine.  Yeah, I better give that to you.  Maybe it got included with me.  Hey, don't.  Uh, I could...  Um, Jimmy, here you go.  Um, no.  Well, I guess the Mets sucked to the point where you decided not to actually give me the 
[02:42:30]  opening day tickets.  Oh, oh, see?  You made fun of them.  You said, see?  This is a joke, right?  You said...  Do you have my tickets in there, maybe?  Yeah, do you have my stuff in there?  What?  No.  I have two.  And what's that thing?  This is, uh, prepaid preferred parking.  The old triple P for Yankee Stadium.  I don't have that.  Uh...  I do.  I'm fancy and schmancy.  Look at these opening day tickets behind the dugout. 
[02:43:00]  Yep.  Here it is.  For a team you don't like anymore.  So you might as well hand them over to me, because I didn't get anything.  Here it goes.  It says, uh, Ant, enjoy.  Uh, please make sure that Jimmy gets a photo and doesn't run out onto the field after Jeter.  Ha, ha, ha.  Because you do that.  You will not use your tickets?  You can have them.  No, I'm sure, I'm sure he's sending me something.  Me?  No, I'm, uh...  We're all going on a date.  I would love to, but honestly, why I can't is, uh... 
[02:43:30]  What are you doing Monday?  I have a delivery coming that I have to be home for, or the building won't accept it.  And also, uh, Eddie Trunk has Sabbath coming in, uh, for a full XM interview or doing something  like that on Monday.  So I want to be here.  These are behind the dugout.  I don't care if it's in Jeter's colon, uh, Sabbath trumps all.  It says, Jeter's colon.  So I love, or thank you very much for that.  I would like to go to a game.  I've never been to opening day, but unfortunately, Black Sabbath takes priority over all.  Well, guess what?  It looks like I get to go to two opening days. 
[02:44:00]  There you go.  I love the Yankees.  Yankees and, uh, the old Devil Rays.  It's probably a lot of fun.  You going at?  Hell yeah.  Heck.  Opening day.  All right.  Very cool.  Come on.  What does the note say?  Beautiful day for baseball.  I would love to go to that.  Fuck.  Hmm.  I'm also working to get you to throw out the first pitch.  Can you imagine that?  What?  Opie?  You?  Maybe.  It can't be me.  They already have who's going to throw it out.  Who?  What?  It's, uh, Corey, uh, Lydell's, uh. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, no.  I'm not going to get to throw out the opening pitch for opening day at Shea Stadium.  That would be insane, Elo.  Elo!  Not that day, but later on in the season when they can't pack the stadium.  Yeah, I know.  Hi, Elo.  When they're like 30 games out.  I want to throw out the first pitch.  Hello, Mr. Lowe.  Actually, the Mets are going to do very well this year.  What's up, Elo?  Not much, guys.  Just want to make sure you guys enjoy opening day.  Hey, Opie's tickets didn't come.  Yeah.  Well, they'll come Monday.  Yeah.  We haven't actually got our block of tickets.  If they don't open for the following week at home. 
[02:45:00]  Jimmy, you sure you can't use your Yankee tickets?  Yeah, I told Elo I can't because, uh, I, I don't know what time, uh, Eddie's got them  coming in, but they're going to be here earlier.  I just have to be here for that.  Well, we're going to either give them to the staff or, God, I really want to go to both  games, but that would be kind of, uh, gluttonous.  No, I wouldn't.  No, I think you should.  You're Opie of the Opie and Anthony show.  Elo, here's what you got to do.  I have a say in this.  Absolutely.  Because I'm going to have to sit next to whoever the fuck those tickets go to.  So they do not go to some stupid listener. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, no, I wouldn't do that.  Who wants to go to the Yankee?  Well, they're all raising their hands out there, though, Ant.  Absolutely.  Maybe we'll do a little double date on Monday.  Oh!  Well, me, you.  Yeah, a little double date.  Elo.  Elo's playing his soundbite.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  I got it all.  Does he have, like, a little mini instant replay?  He's got an instant replay in his office.  I didn't hear it.  He's dying to do radio.  Now, totally.  Well, we're waiting. 
[02:46:00]  That's our boss.  I know.  Insanity.  Now that this merger's happening, he has nothing better to do, really.  No, it's great.  Nate Davis came down, who's our president, and was talking to me about trying to get tickets  to opening day for the Yankees.  Does the car crash work there?  Oh, it works great.  I've got a whole sound system set up in the office now, and I have everything.  And then, you know, the best part for me, when people come in, they have no idea what  I'm doing, because no one knows what an instant replay looks like. 
[02:46:30]  So they're like, what the hell is that?  I'm like, nothing.  So how about this?  They walk in, and they go, hey, I feel like I've been working hard.  I'd like a raise.  Hey, where are the white women at?  See, he doesn't know which one's to play.  No, I wanted the car crash.  Oh, no, usually when they come in, they ask a question.  My question's this.  Hey, where are the white women at?  How about if a guy comes in, he goes, hey, what do you think of Harry Chapin?  Harry Chapin?  Thank you, Anthony.  I helped him. 
[02:47:00]  See, he doesn't know when to play the...  You don't know...  No, he hits weird ones.  Yeah, we've got to test you out.  Okay, test me out.  Here's what he would do.  See, here's a good example.  This is Anthony pushing the button.  See, we'll show you the proper way.  I'll show you.  You call someone into the office, because you're the boss, and you have to fire them.  You would do this.  Look, you've been here a while.  Things aren't quite working out.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to have to let you go.  You ran the 80s channel. 
[02:47:30]  The sad Hulk music.  All right, so Jimmy, give him one, and let's see if he's quick on his feet with his instant  corporate situation, a meeting, or something like that.  Okay.  Hey, you know, I put in my ideas on the new fiscal planning.  What do you think of my fiscal ideas?  You get nothing.  No.  You lose.  You're going to stay.  No, that's if someone's getting fired.  Oh, fired?  I'm sorry.  It's easy.  No. 
[02:48:00]  He's just off.  He's just off.  No, no, here's what, the Gene Wilder one is this.  Hey, you know, I've been working really hard.  I think I need a raise.  What do you think?  You get...  All right, see.  I fucked it up.  Sorry.  All right, give him one.  Okay.  A lovely young lady walks into the office.  Hold on, because I don't want to confuse people.  Ant's going to show you the proper way to get here.  He's got his finger on the button and everything.  A lovely young lady walks into the office and goes,  Hello, Mr. Logan. 
[02:48:30]  I was just thinking I've done a great job,  and I would like to have a raise, please.  Hey, I should have stole home and killed myself.  Like you, rich cunt.  But, of course, Elo has to wreck the bit by pushing a button in the middle of that.  What button did Elo push?  Well, now he's crashing himself.  Finally, he's doing something right.  Oh, I love it.  Which one did you push in that situation, Elo?  Play it again.  Well, here, this is what I hit here.  Nobody likes a tattletale, except, of course, me. 
[02:49:00]  Shut up.  Everyone's saying you stink on the S&P back.  Oh, wow.  Well, I get to practice more.  I've been out of practice.  You're really bad.  I just love that you bought a $2,000 machine to sit on your desk,  and you don't know how to use it.  That's kind of like having us talk in front of the board.  That wouldn't work too well, right?  No, it wouldn't.  Say, hint, hint.  Are you planning a podcast?  Well, yeah.  It's actually I'm going to put on the New York message radio board  after I go to the dentist. 
[02:49:30]  Ow.  Hello, Mr. Logan.  I'm sending someone for lunch.  Would you like something?  Let me have a Diablo sandwich.  I'll make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  See, that's how you use it, Elo.  See, how's your hangover?  It's pretty good.  Yeah, I'm still drunk from the correspondence dinner the other night.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  See, and knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  No, I didn't hear that response.  Yeah.  Elo was at the big dinner where Karl Rove did his dumb rap thing. 
[02:50:00]  That was pathetic.  You saw that live?  Yeah, I was there for the whole thing.  Dude, that's like being at Woodstock.  Holy shit.  And what was the, did the room really think it was funny?  What was the, like, the take on the room?  The room thought it was the funniest thing they've ever seen.  Come on.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I mean, that happens every year.  And last year, Dick Cheney was, did the comedy that Bush did.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Hey, Eric, did the chef come out and ask you how you felt about the dinner? 
[02:50:30]  Did he come out and make any comments on this?  Not at all.  No, see, you were supposed to play a clip there.  Man, you're lost.  Oh, Ant doesn't have it on the same one?  No.  But you didn't ask Ant.  You asked Elo.  Food, all right.  Well, we're waiting.  What?  Good evening.  You're stupid. 
[02:51:00]  So, everyone enjoyed Karl Rove doing the, um...  No, everybody hated it.  Did you laugh?  Yeah, I did, because I was hammered.  Try the wine.  But no, I'm actually going to buy a table for next year.  I think I mentioned the opiate.  We're going to buy a table, and then you, me, Jimmy, and Ant, we're all going to go down.  Boring.  This sucks.  I would love to do that. 
[02:51:30]  I love how Elo always comes up with something we're going to do a year from now.  That's right.  And then you forget about what he told you a year ago.  Why didn't you get it this year?  Oh, it's merger.  That's the answer now.  I mean, I've got so many great corporate excuses right now, you won't even imagine.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  That's right.  Merger ain't happening.  Oh, now, stop that.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  People are working very hard to get this thing through. 
[02:52:00]  I was politicking with the A-list people at the correspondence dinner.  I would love to go to that.  You would.  Yeah, especially given the recent performance at the Jeter dinner.  That would be great.  I was mad.  You could piss off high-profile politicians.  I was very well-behaved at the Jeter dinner, though.  But I wasn't.  No, you did.  I mean, listen, I think if you follow senators in the bathroom, there'll be a different type of guard that gets you this time.  I was hurt.  Jimmy laying on the floor of the bathroom, getting off, telling the pests to attack George Bush. 
[02:52:30]  That's the number of the White House.  Well, there's another one coming up in about two weeks.  It's the White House correspondence dinner.  Oh.  Can we get into that one?  Yeah, I'm into that one.  And last year, they had Covert, the guy that does everything on Comedy Central, offended so many people that they got Rich Little this year.  Are you shitting me?  I swear to God.  They were so concerned with what he would say, they got Rich Little to be the company. 
[02:53:00]  Well, there won't be any controversial statements.  No.  Don't wonder why none of his impressions are still alive.  Hello.  Oh, I'm going to do my Johnny Carson impression for the 80th time.  Great.  Hey, listen, did you get close to Bush at all?  Yeah, I was about, I don't know, maybe 45 feet from him.  Did he have security around him?  You know, rightly enough, he didn't.  What are you, a fucking... 
[02:53:30]  What?  Did he have security around him?  The president.  Why didn't you get a picture with him?  Hmm.  Well, that's when the security would have came out from under the table, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Maybe not.  Is he a good guy?  I highly doubt it, based upon the performance Tuesday night.  Who's the highest person in office, like the most powerful person that you spoke to that night?  Um, let's see, probably Brian Williams of NBC News.  Wow.  That's it? 
[02:54:00]  Did you ask him why he had Mr. Potato Head features?  And his fucking eyes don't match his nose?  Looks like he was all thrown on at the end by God.  Guy would have to pinch a log off and run out and finish his face real quick.  Bum on 42nd Street wants to know, hey, Ope, ask Elo when Mel comes into his office if he'll play I Have Nowhere Else to Go.  Yes, I will.  No, Mel is...  Elo, you're not going anywhere, I hope.  No, I'm here.  I'm not going anywhere.  No. 
[02:54:30]  No.  Yeah, middle management never gets tossed out.  Even upper middle management with mergers.  This is the one time you wish you were in middle management, so...  Hmm.  You just don't want to be, like, redundant.  Yeah.  You don't want to be one of those redundant guys.  Hey, any politicians hit on you?  Catherine Harris from Florida that's got, like, five facelifts.  Jesus.  No, we're talking about the, you know, the guys.  Oh, the guys?  Yeah, did Barney Franks try to get you to fucking pee bag him?  What, did you fucking eat potato salad out of James Traficanti's wig? 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  Wow, that's a good pull.  That fucking thing on his head, it looks like a white throw rug.  I want to pull it off and go, the gag's over, you win.  Whatever bet you made, you win.  That's beautiful.  All right.  So, how's the merger talk?  How's Mel doing with the merger talks?  They've been running them over to Coles over there.  Yeah, just go ahead and hang up now, Opie.  No, I don't hang up on anybody.  No, I'm actually asking you for real. 
[02:55:30]  The merger?  Yeah, because I'm concerned.  You're concerned about the merger?  You?  Yeah, I don't want us to get douched.  We're interested.  Is New York Times best-selling soon-to-be author?  Yeah, you're right.  That's a good point.  Hey, by the way, you know, if I get the chance to throw out the first pitch, I'm throwing  it right into the stadium.  How about you're trying to throw it to center field?  Yeah.  Over the backstop.  I'll turn around and throw it the other way.  I should send you my email when I threw out the first pitch of the All-Star game last 
[02:56:00]  year.  Why?  You're dead riveting.  Yeah.  It's pretty bad.  Were you one of a hundred?  No.  It was...  I got the intro and everything with the name of the Jumbotron.  And you came out and threw it, and what happened?  It was a cutter.  It was down and away.  It was a great pitch.  A cutter?  Down and away, what?  Like ten feet in front of the plate?  It was a one-hopper.  That's embarrassing.  I always knew Elo was a cutter.  Wait. 
[02:56:30]  That's pretty good.  You threw out the opening pitch on the All-Star game?  Yeah, All-Star weekend.  Absolutely.  Did you get to meet all the ballplayers?  Although, yes, I did, actually.  You were the guy on TV throwing out the first pitch.  The guy at the opening game of All-Star weekend, I threw out the first pitch.  On TV?  Opening game of All-Star weekend.  All-Star weekend.  Okay.  Now we understand.  It sounded really like a big shot, but come on.  Let's hear the rest of this.  Well, there was nobody in the stand.  It was five people.  It was a Futures game.  Oh, wow. 
[02:57:00]  They actually...  What they would do is after, like, for that batting practice, they would use his head  to, like, balance the ball on, and they would hit the ball on the top of his  head ball.  I thought I was going to run out of steam on that one because my turn is sore.  Hold on.  Ed wants to tell you something.  Ed in Boston, what's up?  Oh, dude, my wife gave up the balloon knot last night, but you guys almost screwed it  up, I got to tell you.  Why?  Oh, describe this.  We're on the couch, right?  Her legs are way up in the air.  I'm going to town, and she says, I want you to put in my ass.  Now, I'm only a gentleman. 
[02:57:30]  I must oblige, you know.  And I thought, I got to loosen this up.  You know how it is.  And so, I get down there, and I work a finger, and I start laughing because the only thing  I can think of is I'm going to work two fingers in you, I'm going to work them around in  circular motion, and I'm going to put my fist in you.  And oh, my God, I almost screwed it up.  Oh, that's the promo with E-Rod.  Yeah, you don't want to laugh.  E-Lo, are you for anal sex?  Am I for anal sex?  Yeah, what's your stance?  Well, because it's not mine.  Right.  Yeah, I agree with that.  Good answer.  But I learned something else on you guys' show. 
[02:58:00]  What?  Listen to this.  My wife comes home, and I come home from work.  I'm dealing with one working, and she tells stories like she doesn't stop.  And so, I said to her, and then what happened?  And then what happened?  Every time she says something, just like Opie does, man, it works like a charm, let me tell  you.  You sure bring the show home with you, don't you?  He's got the home version.  I like that.  Nothing wrong with the home version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, you didn't say hi to Elo.  Hi, Elo.  How are you?  When you speak to Elo, sir, and all the callers, when you speak to Elo, say, love you, Elo, 
[02:58:30]  love your sound clips.  Love you, Elo, love your sound clips.  That's exactly what Mancow said when he called me yesterday.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  Did he really call you?  No.  He actually had called before, though.  Of course he has.  Yeah.  He's calling everybody.  He's calling CB radio companies.  Ham operators.  Yeah, ham operators.  Can I broadcast on your ham radio?  Jackass.  Eric?  Yes, sir?  Are we going to be thrown off XM? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, we are.  Probably.  We're very nervous about that.  We're very sad about it.  Just say it so the message boards can write about it, Elo.  Well, I mean, this is going to be a tough, tough go the next 12 months with you guys on  XM.  It really is.  Yeah.  No, we mean afterwards.  Like once, you know, certain parties are in place and certain things are happening.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  It's going to be challenging.  I can't lie to you.  Yeah.  Well, we felt connected for a long time.  We love this company.  This company loves us, as far as we thought.  Now we've got to start kissing XM's ass again because CBS got rid of Joel Hollander. 
[02:59:30]  God, does this suck.  Yeah, I'm next.  I thought you were a shoo-in for that job.  Yeah.  Why didn't you go for that job, Elo?  You should have gone for the CBS job.  Yeah.  Well, I was trying to, but I was afraid if Ant would call me psychotic.  Well, you have a job.  You don't need a new one.  I didn't call Dan Mason psychotic.  Well, that's not what I read.  It's in print.  It's in print, Ant.  What did I tell you?  I'm going to have to speak to that guy when he gets into his office and say, look, I never 
[03:00:00]  said that.  No, he said he was gay.  I did not.  Well, that was all fair.  You did ask him about anal sex, though.  Never, ever, ever.  Dan is a nice man.  Met him on numerous occasions.  Always enjoyed his company.  Dan and I have been corresponding via email over the last 72 hours.  Oh.  Well, that's nice.  Yeah.  Just wished him all the best.  That's good.  Has he been saying, look, how much to get these two off my airways?  Exactly.  Did he say, who are you, and then hit the spam button on your email? 
[03:00:30]  All right, we've got to get to Laszlo.  Yeah.  Go, Laszlo.  Hey, Laszlo.  Good talking to you.  You too, buddy.  All right.  Actually, I just watched the trailer.  It was great.  Thank you very much.  Can't wait for the game.  Laszlo's doing a show tomorrow night.  Eric, what do you think of that?  Razzle-dazzle.  Can't wait.  No, you're supposed to play a fucking sound clip.  Jesus.  Elon.  Oh, Lordy, no.  It's always wrong.  It's always wrong.  I don't like his schizophrenic clips. 
[03:01:00]  Well, I'll bet I know who he doesn't play that one for when he walks into the office  to give Elon a scolding.  I actually had to have a bank of uncensored and censored, because if I get the wrong one,  hit the wrong button with the wrong person, it's over.  Yeah, that's bad.  Where do you get your sound clips from, though?  Did you actually ask some of the guys from the Opie and Anthony show to send a big zip  file of sound clips?  I've actually tasked many producers.  I actually hand them the instant replay and stick them upstairs for two or three hours and 
[03:01:30]  get me new clips.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Quiet.  Stop whining.  Boring.  This sucks.  All right, Elon.  I need one of those in life.  Yeah.  This sucks.  See you guys.  Bye.  Bye, Eric.  Bye, Eric Logan.  Those things rule.  Thanks for the tickets, by the way.  Yeah, thank you anyway, Elon.  You'll hear on the replay.  Thank you for the Yankees and Mets.  Home opener tickets.  Home opener tickets. 
[03:02:00]  Home opener.  Home opener.  He's very nice of him.  I like Eric Logan.  He's a good egg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Elo.  Laszlo, sorry.  Laszlo, Elo.  We're both from Oklahoma, actually.  Really?  Yeah.  I went out to lunch with Elo, and he's like, we have to go to this place that's got a lot  of stuff from Oklahoma on the wall.  On the wall?  Yeah.  The Ramrod Bar.  No, it's an Oklahoma sports bar. 
[03:02:30]  I'm serious.  Fucking good one, Jerry.  All right, Technophile, you're doing it tomorrow night on 202, right?  Well, I'm doing the Laszlo show.  Oh, actually, the Laszlo show.  Right, sure.  Which is different than the Technophile.  Yeah, for the Technophile, I went to Germany last week.  Germany.  And went to CBIT, which is the largest technology convention in the world.  It's like hundreds of thousands of people from around the world.  Yeah.  And one of the striking differences in conventions in Europe versus the United States, like at  E3, the big video game convention, they had a thing last year where they said no booth 
[03:03:00]  babes for some reason.  They said it was offensive to the women.  They had booth babes at this convention.  This is a technology convention.  They had booth babes that were topless.  For like accounting software or some shit.  Another difference, too, in the big German things is they have the fun thing to do there  is the Dunkerjew.  Topless babes.  Yeah.  At booths.  See, they're not uptight over there.  They know that people could handle their freaking nudity. 
[03:03:30]  It's weird.  You go into like a magazine shop and the porn section, you know how it's sort of behind  the counter at 7-Eleven?  Because you have to be ashamed to buy stuff like that in America.  You walk by and there's like, you know, kids walking around the magazine shop or whatever  and the porn section has got the front of magazines with chicks, legs completely spread, full  snatch shot.  And kids are just walking by like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Good.  Good for them.  And we're a bunch of fucking sticks in the mud.  Yeah.  We're all ashamed when it comes to sex. 
[03:04:00]  Problem country.  So there was obviously the convention and Laszlo's brought over from Europe some information  on some of these things.  I like this one.  Ringtones.  Oh, there's some of the naked booth babes.  Oh, they paint them up and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  Yeah, that girl needs blue paint.  That one.  What's that?  Well, there's a little sagging going on.  One in the middle looks like she was saved by the Allies at the end of the war. 
[03:04:30]  Hair's a little short.  All right.  I actually went to Auschwitz while I was there.  Did you?  Yeah, I went to Poland after the...  And if you ever want to go to Europe, I can map a full trip for you because I know that  you're never interested in leaving the country.  Yeah.  But there was a hotel in a town in Poland that we stayed at where Hitler used to make  speeches off the balcony.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you could rent the Hitler room.  You could take the... 
[03:05:00]  Oh, really?  Get the Hitler room over there?  And go walk out on the balcony?  It's nice.  Go have a tea at the Eagle's Nest?  What a creep.  Well, I'm interested in the era.  Yes.  I like the World War II era and memorabilia from everything.  I'm not talking about Nazis.  These, I'm just talking about like the whole era, intrigues me.  So I would like to go to Europe and visit some of those places.  So you went to Auschwitz.  Yeah, I want to know about Auschwitz.  And how is that?  Well, I wear my razzle-dazzle t-shirts. 
[03:05:30]  I thought I did maybe get some funny shots, but the place is a bit of a downer.  Is it a bit of a downer?  Is it a solemn place?  Are there a lot of people there as far as like people that work there?  I don't mean work, work.  They're like, you know, work is freedom kind of thing.  I mean, like...  It's massive.  It stretches on forever when you walk in.  And it's just like prison house after prison house after prison house.  And you can just walk into them.  And they look like they were abandoned two years ago. 
[03:06:00]  Really?  Yeah.  They've left the place like when the Nazis split.  And so you go into this area and there's piles of human hair where they would shave it off of people's heads and then gas them.  And they just have left the piles there.  And then there's piles of baby shoes.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  They didn't get rid of all that?  They left everything there.  Yeah, they made it part of a museum.  I thought they got rid of all that stuff.  Dude, you're standing in front of a pile literally the size of a room full of ponytails just chopped off.  Poor ponies.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  What do they sell in the gift shop?  Yeah, it's a little morbid.  They did.  They do have a gift shop.  Is there an Auschwitz gift shop?  That's insane.  Yeah.  You can get postcards.  You have postcards from Auschwitz.  What?  I went to Auschwitz and all I got was this lousy arm tattoo.  Oh, God.  They're actual black and white postcards.  Black and white is more acceptable. 
[03:07:00]  They had a ton of stuff in the gift shop, actually.  How sad was it to see that shit piled up, man?  It's awful, right?  There was no snow globes or anything.  No, nothing jolly or merry.  Do they walk you through the front gate?  Is that how you get in?  You just walk through.  You walk right through.  It's not like a...  Because I'm used to America where no matter what it is,  there's an admission, there's people that work there,  there's security, there's, you know,  don't touch this, don't go here.  Is it that vibe?  No.  Or is it just kind of an abandoned place  that you feel like you're hanging out with your buddies 
[03:07:30]  walking through?  No, you walk through the gate where it says, you know,  with work comes freedom or whatever,  and you just stroll around.  And you go from, like, you walk up to this...  Arbit Mach 3.  Yeah, you walk into this one building,  and there's a sign that says,  oh, here's where they used to do experiments on people.  What's to keep you from stealing the hair of baby shoes?  No, I mean, they have, like, glass in front of it  and stuff like that, but thanks for...  I did think about bringing...  Stealing Anthony something back. 
[03:08:00]  Dead baby shoes?  That would have been great.  Awful.  Hang them from my rear view mirror.  What the hell would I do with dead baby shoes, you sicko?  No, I understand.  Oh.  I'm just saying, what prevents even, like, young Germans  from burning shit?  Like, you know, they're fucking Germans.  What was weird is when you go into some of the bunkhouse,  like the prison houses and stuff like that,  because they're open,  you can just walk around this enormous complex,  it's like, I don't know...  Yeah, I see the postcards, man.  How many football fields of space?  And you walk in, and, like,  German kids and stuff have gone in  and put, like, their gang tags inside. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  No respect.  Fucking...  Just an awful country.  Wow, look at that.  That is giant.  Just sprawling.  Ooh, there's the barbed wire of fences.  Very familiar.  Can you go into the bar towers and stuff?  No, I didn't go into the bar towers.  Uh, I don't think you can.  The train tracks.  How long do you walk around for?  It pretty much takes all day.  Yee.  That building's got a chimney on it.  Yeah.  Is that, uh...  Yeah, I walked inside there. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, you can go in and open the oven doors and...  That is insane.  You can go in and open an oven door.  Yeah.  I swear to God, they left it like the Nazis split two years ago and...  Oh, that's the, uh, yard between blocks 10 and 11 where thousands of prisoners, uh, mainly  Poles, were shot dead by the SS.  Yeah, they're right there.  Oh, look at that.  My goodness.  What jolly postcards they brought back from Germany there.  And they're from, actually, Auschwitz is in Poland. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, Poland, sorry.  Yeah, hi, Mom, having a great time in Poland.  Can't wait to see you.  Are there nice hotels and stuff around there you can stay in at least?  No, the town, the town's...  Is morbid.  It has to be.  Yeah, like, there's, like, the look on people's faces.  I'm sure there's not a Hooters in the town.  That one is a little inappropriate, the one that says, wish you were here.  What's in the town?  Nothing.  And who would live in this town?  I have no idea.  Is there restaurants?  Yeah, there's some restaurants, and... 
[03:10:00]  You see happy people just walking around?  No, they have that look on their face like...  Yeah, we know what you're...  Yeah, we live here, yeah.  It was either this or Flint, Michigan.  I picked...  It's bizarre how the train tracks, though, just go right through the front doors and go to  the back of the facility, and there's, like, two...  There's ovens on the left and the right side, and they would just empty the trains and  herd them right in.  Wow.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  So, did you get, like, an eerie feeling when you're there?  Do you get this kind of...  Yeah, it's creepy.  It's probably the most evil place I've ever been, other than Branson, Missouri. 
[03:10:30]  The place is fucked, Branson.  Do you feel an energy there, like, just an evil energy?  It's bad news, dude.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, I wanted to...  I thought of Anthony, like, could I bring something back?  But I didn't even want to have anything in my possession in this place.  It seems like evil, like, just bad ground.  Like, there are spirits there that just are not at rest, probably.  And you could...  It's probably, like, something you could actually feel.  Was it a sunny day when you were there?  No.  Of course, it was drizzling and overcast, which is... 
[03:11:00]  I don't know what it is about Eastern Europe, but as soon as you cross over, it just turns  to drizzle.  Nasty.  Everybody just looks depressed.  Wow.  I wonder what it's like to go back there as somebody who survived this, like, to see  it, like, where you can walk freely in and out.  I'm sure it's just like seeing your old college.  Yeah.  The alma mater?  Yeah.  Go into your old bunkhouse where there are notches on how tall you were getting.  They actually showed...  It's not a happy place.  You could walk into some of the prison cells and see, like, artwork that people had scraped 
[03:11:30]  with their fingernails.  Really?  Yeah.  Man, that is a...  That's a hell of a word.  Yeah, it's a bit of a downer.  What made you do that?  I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it's because I've made so many horrible sort of, like, Jew and gas jokes over the years  that I was like, you know what?  I should actually...  Put this in some perspective.  Like, oh, I'll switch, you know?  Give me those ribs kind of vibe.  Did it change anything?  Yeah, I was going to ask that, too.  Did it change you?  No.  A little bit.  Now, come on. 
[03:12:00]  It's easy to do the jokes, but, I mean, did it change you?  You know, it's probably after 9-11 where you sort of, like, there's that period where  you kind of take things really seriously.  Yeah, if you go down to Ground Zero and stuff and kind of walk around, you feel that way.  You get all angry again and kind of get those feelings churned up.  So I'm sure if you go there...  Then you go to the airport and they fucking take your toothpaste away.  Yeah, and then...  Fuck.  Then you get pissed.  Do you have any snacks while you're there?  Yeah, I kind of lost my appetite.  I've got to be honest.  That would kind of...  That would suck, like... 
[03:12:30]  Wow, this is a side of Laszlo we've never seen.  Some big fat tourist just, like, eating an ice cream cone where people were starving to  death, you know?  But you walk around the grounds and there's these huge pits where after they would burn  the bodies, they would just go dump the ashes.  And you're just, like, standing at the edge of, you know, a huge pit of cremains.  Like, you know what?  I'm not real hungry.  All that stuff is still there.  They didn't bury it up or throw dirt on it.  Nope.  And all it is, when you think of those things, because you've been to places where you think 
[03:13:00]  all it's been is time.  Like, just time has gone by between me standing here and horrific things happening.  It's the exact location where these awful things happen.  And the only difference is, you know, days on a calendar going by.  That is creepy.  So you can fly from here to Poland.  And where can you stay in Poland that's kind of, like, decent?  Krakow.  Krakow's awesome.  That's where we stayed.  How far is that from there?  Krakow.  Hour and a half.  Yeah, an hour and a half from Auschwitz. 
[03:13:30]  Another camp.  The town is untouched from World War II.  Is there another camp over there?  Yeah, I believe there was another camp outside of Krakow.  But, I mean, Auschwitz-Birkenau, is it called?  That's your big camp.  That's that.  Yeah, if you're going to go, that's the one you want to go to.  I like the Disney of concentration camps.  Do they speak English there, people?  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  And people actually work?  Work there?  Yeah.  I'm sure you could get a guide or something, right?  Work at Auschwitz.  That would just be like, eh. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, some of the guides are, like, you know, people that were living there involuntarily.  Oh.  Oh, now this is their therapy to take you on the tour?  Take fat American tourists around.  Hey, here's where all my buddies got.  And then you hand them the camera and go, hey, can you take my picture?  Take a picture of me over here.  Take a picture by the front gate.  Murray, get over here.  Get the camera.  Like stupid American people.  They don't understand.  So, wait a minute.  How far a flight is Poland?  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Days. 
[03:14:30]  It's like nine hours.  It's not that bad.  Yeah, it's not that bad.  I'm thinking of going there, man.  Really?  I didn't see that, yeah.  Yeah, but then you've got to take a boxcar there, which takes a while.  They really want you to get the experience.  No, I kind of want to go.  Yeah.  I would do, like, a whole...  If I was to go to Europe, I would do a whole World War II tour.  I would want to see Normandy.  I would want to see some in France.  Maybe their stupid fucking Maginot Line. 
[03:15:00]  Germany, obviously.  I want to go to Berlin.  Poland's cool, because you can check out restaurants that have been around since, like, 1382 that the SS took over.  Like, the finest restaurant in Krakow.  One of the things that says, you know, was a favorite of the SS.  Like, oh, well, we should go.  Well, it's like, you know, the truckers love this place.  You know, it's got to be good.  Oh, the SS ain't here.  How expensive is it?  Oh, it's cheap. 
[03:15:30]  Poland?  Yeah.  Isn't it weird?  Well, you can go to the SS's favorite restaurant and get a huge plate full of boar, wild boar, duck, and venison with loads of wine for next to nothing.  Yeah.  For the price of a Luger.  Oh, boar.  I thought they were serving E-Rock.  Didn't say serving incompetent.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break and get happy?  Yeah, I'll tell you about some of the cool stuff from CBIT.  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's do the technophile with Oslo next.  Stay there.  B.O.P. and Anthony's show proudly presents an intimate moment with adult video star Diesel Washington and our own E-Rock. 
[03:16:00]  Now, you can make this easy or you can make it hard.  You're going to do everything I say.  If you don't do anything I say, I'm going to smack you across the face.  I start off on your knees first.  Sniff my balls with your nose first.  Then I'll pull out my cock.  Stub it in the back of your throat.  Smack it across the face a couple of times.  Then bend you over.  Spit into your asshole. 
[03:16:30]  Work two fingers in there.  Open it up in a circular fashion.  Then I'll work my fist in you.  All right.  We got Laszlo in studio.  Yo, yo.  Really quick.  This is a good question from Detroit.  Ryan, what's up?  Oh, love you guys.  Love your show.  I just wanted to know how the pets are making out with Mandouche. 
[03:17:00]  That's a good question.  Maybe we can get an update before we leave for the weekend.  Can we get out the number?  We want an all-out attack on that douche.  Yeah, that'd be nice to hear.  Yeah, what's the phone number?  I'm on my way home, so I'm coming into the attack.  It's 1-888-2-MAN-COW.  Yeah?  That was it.  All right.  We're...  888-2-MAN-COW. 
[03:17:30]  All right, Laszlo, let's get into the technophiles.  Call him and just bash him.  Yeah, we'll get an update.  Ringtones for car alarms.  Yeah, you know, ringtones make so much money, and they keep trying to figure out new ways  to get you to buy the same song 18 times.  Yeah.  So, over at the CBIT convention in Germany, they were showing off these car alarms that...  You know when people alarm their car and you get that stupid chirp sound or whatever?  Instead of that chirp, you can play, you know, like 5, 10 seconds of your favorite song.  You can also load in a ringtone that'll play if somebody's breaking into your car. 
[03:18:00]  Really?  Yeah.  So, instead of the alarm, it plays the ringtone?  Right.  I think depending on what neighborhood you're parking your car in,  maybe this.  And listen to you, communist, and niggers, and Jews.  Tell all your buddies to spread the news.  The judgment will soon be nigh.  As the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high.  Will his battle be lost by mixing the races?  We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces. 
[03:18:30]  Wouldn't that be nice?  You didn't let the chorus play.  And listen to you, communist, and niggers, and Jews.  I'll listen to it again.  But it's to spread the news.  The judgment will soon be nigh.  As the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high.  Will his battle be lost by mixing the races?  We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces.  Oh, never, never, never I say.  For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay. 
[03:19:00]  Never, never, never I say.  Because the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay.  They really break your concentration when you're trying to pull out a car stereo.  And that's playing.  What the fuck, motherfucker?  You want to just tap your toes.  Well, look how you communist, niggers, and Jews.  That's a whole bunch of unpleasant people listed in one group of these people.  They certainly don't like the communist, niggers, or Jews.  Communists.  By the way, dumb idea.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just stupid. 
[03:19:30]  Well, you know, they keep putting all these new hard drives, and that's the new thing is like PCs for your car.  For everything, yeah.  For everything.  And, you know, they have the PCs for your car now that has Wi-Fi, so that when you drive up, it links with your home computer.  And when you're at your computer, you can be dumping, you know, movies and music and stuff to your car that's sitting down the driveway.  Because, you know, God forbid you not watch movies while you drive down the road.  You don't have access.  You need access to online 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
[03:20:00]  It's just the world we live in now.  Who doesn't have access to some form of the internet or even your email or something at all times?  And we're just obsessed with, like, everyone's fucking got the BlackBerry out or their phones or something and constantly texting or checking your email.  It's just what we do now.  Constantly.  They're starting to talk about passing laws against texting while driving. 
[03:20:30]  In Jersey.  Yeah.  That story hit this week.  Been a few accidents.  Because, dude, I'm guilty.  Like, the BlackBerry goes off when you drive.  Like, oh.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, oh, we'll tap one out real quick at 60 miles an hour.  I answer email as I drive.  Yes.  I just, like, Y-E-A.  And you're looking down.  Where is that letter?  You look up.  You're weaving over on the road.  I had a friend smash his Escalade into a concrete bar.  BlackBerry.  Texting.  Yeah.  You just send, thanks for the...  I just hit a wall. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, we got a problem here.  Don, what's up?  Yo, man.  You guys are going to get me killed.  Hang on a minute.  Oh, no.  I'm at a gas station here.  And I'm filling up.  When you guys...  And you guys just started playing that shit.  You got to give us a little bit of warning, man.  Holy shit, dude.  Now, let's be a communist and niggers in June.  Tell all your buddies to spread the news.  I like the fact that it's...  I'm in the van right now.  But the guy behind me in the pickup truck didn't seem to like it too much. 
[03:21:30]  We hear this from time and time that we'll all of a sudden just play something and you  got the radio real loud in your cubicle or you leave your car to gas up and you want  to hear the show so you turn it up a little louder.  You turn it up loud while you're at the back of your car and you just slow motion.  No!  I had the driver's side door open and I'm standing there and I just started to walk  around to the back of the van, man, to go get the windshield wiper thing and all of a  sudden that cracked in and I'm like, holy shit.  You just see a black guy that looks just like Marsalis Wallace carrying the coffee when 
[03:22:00]  he sees Bruce Willis.  Motherfucker!  We hear about that from time to time.  You know what's a great line there where he goes, what's it, something, come all you,  the first word.  Now listen, you communists and niggas and Jews, tell all your buddies to spread the news.  I love the tell all your buddies to spread the news.  Like, okay, all communists, all niggas and all Jews are going around going, guess what? 
[03:22:30]  The Ku Klux Klan is here to stay and they want pretty babies, not ones with brown faces.  They don't believe in mixing the races.  Why are you telling me this?  Because they told me to spread the news.  Spreading the news.  Like it's to my buddies.  Like it's good stuff.  To my buddies.  Tell your buddies.  Now listen, all you communists and niggas and Jews.  All right, what else we got on the techno file?  Oh, yeah, I saw the world's largest LCD screen.  You know, they keep trying to outdo each other with, like, the world's largest plasma. 
[03:23:00]  That was one, 103 inches.  The one in Dallas is going to be massive.  The Cowboys, their new stadium.  Oh, really?  They were showing their display.  Holy shit.  It's getting nuts, but there's home LCD screens, you know, for your living room.  I saw one that they debuted there.  There's 108 inches.  And the screen costs $80,000.  Nice.  $80,000.  Which would be pretty sweet if you're playing with your Nintendo Wii and you fling the fucking  controller into the middle of the screen. 
[03:23:30]  Fan comment?  No?  The Wii?  I'm responsible.  How big is 108 inches?  It's the size of that wall.  Or that window, probably, right?  Oh, much bigger than that.  It's even bigger than that.  It's even bigger than that, Jimmy.  It's like my dick plus 98.  Correct.  Is it really as big as that wall?  About?  It's massive.  It's very big.  They also showed off waterproof LCDs for placement by the pool.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  It was pretty nuts.  You can now mount LCD screens outside so that you're never away from your entertainment.  It's cool.  Yeah.  And they get rained on, whatever.  Sunshine.  Yeah.  No problem.  No ill effects.  And you can watch all your programs.  Correct.  I'm watching out by the pool, darling.  I'd splash water on it just to have fun.  You know, you're talking about sending messages.  They had one of those crotch rocket motorcycles there and outfitting it with all this gizzardry  and gadgetry. 
[03:24:30]  And they had this device that goes on the tank.  It's like a GPS or whatever.  And they were showing off how you can send messages that gets a wireless signal.  So while you're on a motorcycle, you're tapping out fucking text messages.  Oh, that's what you need to be doing.  At least when you're in a car, there's a chance of you living if you get into it.  Yeah.  Got an airbag.  Oh, you do not need that.  No kidding.  You know, I was kind of joking.  I was only joking when I was talking about...  The black people?  No.  I was talking about...  All right. 
[03:25:00]  Well...  The voice text...  It said voice text would be a great idea.  And it got a laugh because you got a phone.  You're talking into it.  Why not just call your friend?  Well, the reason you don't want to call is because that's the reason you're sending me  a text in the first place.  You want to just get...  Yeah.  So my girlfriend just got a new phone.  It has voice-activated text.  So you talk into it with voice identification.  It types out what you're saying, and then you send it as a text.  So instead of having to punch in, you just talk. 
[03:25:30]  And we got it right?  I guess so.  I hear that technology is getting a lot better.  Yeah, it is getting a lot better.  Oh, yeah.  I checked out a couple of things like that over there where you can...  And you can even do it where somebody sends you an email.  It reads it to you aloud while you're driving.  And then you say out loud, reply.  And then you go, no, go fuck yourself.  I want more money.  And then it will either put it in text, like you're saying, or just record like an MP3  and email them the MP3.  No, go fuck yourself.  Yeah, and I stopped by this one booth that was giving away mobile phone condoms, which 
[03:26:00]  was...  Well, I like that, actually.  Just in case someone uses your phone?  Well...  Bunch of germaphobes we are.  Let me use it.  Excuse me, Mr. Reed, would you like to call the hospital?  Use this.  Oh, just in case you carry your phone in your asshole.  In case?  Yeah.  Well, I guess it's...  This guy was telling me it's so you can take your phone swimming. 
[03:26:30]  But it's just a condom.  I thought it would be a little different looking.  No, and you wrap it around your phone, the guy was showing you.  Oh, that guy's a douche.  What I really want to do is put one...  And what?  Then tie a knot?  Yeah, tie a knot on the end.  And then stick it up some chick's hoochie.  Yeah.  How about just fucking leaving it with your clothes and talking when you get out of the  pool?  All right, look, now we all have to do this, which this is so stupid.  I've got to roll the condom on my phone.  Yeah, but the problem is...  Oh, my phone just came. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, it fucking happens.  It doesn't work so well on flip phones, I think, is the problem.  It looks like one of my condoms.  It's...  I think it's for...  It's a regular condom.  ...for the candy bar phones.  There it goes, though.  No, it just went over my flip phone.  Oh.  Yeah.  Is that a calling?  That would suck.  How do I get it off?  It's got that reservoir tip in case you get...  That's good.  Too many fucking text messages or something.  Somehow the phone call just doesn't feel as good, though.  I know. 
[03:27:30]  It sucks.  I'm going to pull it off.  Yeah, it's dumb.  That's a dumb...  Yeah, it really didn't...  I guess it would make sense if you, like, painted pools for a living or something, but...  Because you can't...  You can't answer the fucking thing.  No, he says, well, if you've got a flip phone, yeah, but if you've got, like, a candy  bar phone, then you can...  The guy said, oh, yeah, you can talk to it.  I go, isn't it a little odd to have a condom up against your face talking into it?  Yeah.  Not in certain circles.  Not with a phone in it.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, that's a non-idea. 
[03:28:00]  And Thann and I were talking about this.  There was these new digital cameras that are coming out that have GPS, so that every time  you take a photo, it records the exact latitude and longitude of where you're standing.  Where the photo is taken?  And then when you jack it into your computer, it'll pull up a Google Earth map so that you  can have, like, a clickable map of all the icons will show sort of, like, a breadcrumb  trail of the exact places that you took photos in case you...  That's kind of cool, though.  That is kind of cool.  Come in handy for some applications. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  None of which I could think of now.  Right.  I'm thinking, like, it's cool, but I'm thinking how they catch criminals.  There's something they could do with it.  Yeah.  Something.  Let's just acknowledge how I not only derailed that discussion, but just contributed nothing.  I just talked.  Yeah.  Open your mouth and sound.  There was an emotion there.  Like, I thought I had something.  I'm talking.  I'm going, you're just...  This is meaningless to even me.  This is boring to even think, much less tell two countries. 
[03:29:00]  So my apologies to the listeners.  Brought up a Google map, and I...  On FARC today, I was laughing.  FARC.com.  They had a little thing where somebody put in...  They wanted directions.  Oh, is this to Ireland?  Yeah.  From Chicago to London, England.  And at step 20, it ended in Massachusetts at some place.  And then it said, swim across Atlantic Ocean, 3,200 miles or something like that. 
[03:29:30]  And the whole trip was supposed to take something like 30 days or 29 days and change.  I guess, and we thought, why would they do that?  And probably because people were goofing on them.  They were like, well, you say drive, you know, across the ocean.  Take a left.  Take a left.  So they put in swim.  I just love that somebody at Google Maps or whatever had the foresight to put that  into the programming to make a command to leave the dock and your car and swim across the  Atlantic. 
[03:30:00]  And then somehow, after you're done swimming, you just have to hop up on a road because from  the swimming, it's another road.  So you have to know exactly where to swim to to get out, towel off, get yourself a rental,  drive on the wrong side of the road.  Yeah.  Plus...  That's where you're going.  Your possessions, how do you carry them?  How?  What, are you going to swim?  Swim in the whole way.  And you're going to have...  A mobile phone condom.  Yeah, but that's...  How do you carry your suit?  What if you're going to a wedding or a function of some sort? 
[03:30:30]  Your suit will wrinkle.  Hey, the Man Cow update.  Man Cow screener is going nuts.  He asked me, how would you like it if I bothered you all day at your job?  Wow.  Way to make a comeback.  Way to go.  That'll get people to stop.  He is good.  What else you got, Laszlo?  Oh, finally, I saw this.  You know, they keep cramming more junk into mobile phones, and this one very frightening  German gentleman showed me how they're trying to put breathalyzers...  You a detector?  Yeah.  Oh, you said frightening German, man. 
[03:31:00]  That's right.  It has a penny that it just drops out of the phone, and whoever immediately goes to get  it, well, you got your man.  That old gag.  Oh, jeez.  Penny jokes are timeless.  Fucking...  Eating pennies, dropping pennies.  Wait, there was a...  I remember there was one Jewish joke that always made me laugh, and it's really awful.  It was like, to hell with the expense, shouted Mr. Finkelstein, give that parakeet another 
[03:31:30]  seed.  I guess, oh, my God.  To hell with these expenses, give my seeds.  That's awful.  It's just awful.  No, but so they're putting breathalyzers into mobile phones so that if you've got...  What?  Well, if you've got a staff out in the field where you...  Oh.  Like, they have a real problem up on the slope, as they call it, in Alaska.  Yeah.  You know, they're constantly, randomly drug testing those guys because it's so depressing. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, you need a little something.  You need a little pop to get you through.  To get you through, but you're working on a pipeline that if it could have exploded, you'd  have a crater the size of Manhattan.  Yeah.  So, basically, the boss could call the phone and say, you know, blow into your phone.  Breathe into your phone.  Right.  And it sends the results back to him by text message.  Wow.  That...  We need one of those.  We got a dude from Hoboken.  Oh.  Hoboken.  What's up, bro?  It's Too Fat from Hoboken. 
[03:32:30]  I got a gem for you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's end the show with a bang.  What are you talking about, sir?  Yeah, what's my girl?  If you guys want to freeze, I mean, it's not a visual.  I don't got the computer stuff, the...  Howl talk?  Yeah, howl talk, but you guys, I can put it on speaker.  All right, yeah, put it on speaker.  Laszlo, you got it?  Hold on, let me turn off my radio.  Let me turn off my XM.  All right.  What else you got there, Laszlo?  Well, security software is so huge at these... 
[03:33:00]  Is my joint ready?  Hold on for a second, sir.  Security software is so huge at these conventions, you know, that people are just so...  He's going to love us.  Oh, sorry, sir.  Go ahead.  Why don't you just talk?  What are you doing?  Jesus.  Sorry, Laszlo.  Hoboken dude.  Too fat.  Hoboken guy ain't going to shut up.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, what's up?  Hold on one...  I'm seeing Anthony.  My ear.  All right, too fat.  Hold on one second.  Laszlo has one last thing to do, and then you're like the showstopper.  Go on, Laszlo.  All right.  Laszlo, out of here.  We got real business. 
[03:33:30]  Jesus.  He ain't going to shut up.  Just start quietly.  Just start fucking her quietly.  Yeah, we'll get to you when...  You're right, you're right.  I got to get a rod, man.  All right.  All right, go get a rod.  Laszlo's going to do his last item here.  I'm going to put you on speaker.  Hold on.  All right.  Jesus.  Thank God.  If you're paranoid about like your chick getting on your computer and like poking around or  using your machine...  Yes.  They've got security software now where the computer knows if it's you typing because  you have a specific sort of algorithm to the way that you type and the way that you 
[03:34:00]  click around.  Ooh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  So like if all of a sudden on the computer you type in a word with an N and a couple of  Gs, they just know it's Anthony?  So if it detects that it's an algorithm different from the way that you normally type, it will  just freeze up and lock the person out.  What if it's you?  Just switch it up a little bit.  Well, if you're drunk, that's the question I had is if you're shit-faced, you're going  to type differently.  Where can I get this software?  It's going to be on the internet pretty soon.  All right, too fat. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, what's up?  Laszlo's doing his regular show tomorrow night, by the way, on 202.  Yeah, it's the Laszlo Show.  Big Wayne, Reed, Cousin Ed.  Oh, it's an off weekend, huh?  Cousin Ed from Philly?  Yes, who was fired months ago.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  He was there for 20 years.  What happened?  I don't know.  CBS downsizing.  Hello?  Hey.  He's my hero.  Say hi, Jimmy.  Hello, madam. 
[03:35:00]  All right, you two.  What's your name, ma'am?  Well, we're going to call her Jane.  Okay.  Is Jane hot?  Yeah, she's fucking real hot, dude.  And they call me too fat, not because I'm fat.  Yeah, I'm fat in midsection.  We don't really care about you, sir.  I want to know what he looks like.  We never asked about you, sir.  We want her to be miked for this.  Hey, babe, come on.  They want to hear you.  Hello?  Hi, how are you? 
[03:35:30]  And how are you?  Good.  So you're being fucked, eh?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah?  Huh?  Is he doing it right now?  Huh?  Is he fucking you right now?  Come on, Tony.  I'm going to make her give me some head, aunt.  Hold on.  Let's hear it sloppy.  Sloppy or no good.  Spit on it. 
[03:36:00]  Spit on it.  Spit on it.  Stop that car.  Oh, no.  Stop that car.  It's impossible to come up with original new sex talk.  No, it's not.  There's nothing new. 
[03:36:30]  You got to, like, maybe go revert back to, like, 1870 or 1850 when they used to...  The old whore.  Like, ah, yes.  Mmm, bell.  I remember on the eve of the 4th, the blowjob you gave me was exquisite.  No, you just got to think on your feet.  Like, if I'm...  What?  I always tell my girlfriend, oh, baby, you're as tight as a baby carcass.  I'm good.  That's good.  Too fat. 
[03:37:00]  What's up, brother?  All right, what were you up to?  Oh, man, I just fucking...  I just got turtle dick right now.  I can't get on.  I'm getting stage fright.  Turtle dick.  He's got turtle dick.  In front of two countries.  Ah, she was giving you a blowjob and you fucking lost your rod.  Hey, at least he's honest.  Let's talk to Jane.  Jane.  Jane, I want to talk to you, babe.  Talk.  Hello.  Say hi.  Hello.  Jane, what happened?  What happened to his rod?  It got small.  It got small.  It got real small? 
[03:37:30]  It got really small.  You guys are talking too much.  You guys are making me out of his stage fright.  All right, here's what you do.  First of all, that speakerphone kind of sucks.  Could you take it off the speakerphone, please?  We're going to call you from a better phone.  I'm going to tell your screeners to be ready.  Hold on.  All right.  Well, we'll keep this line just in case we lose you.  Don't hang up.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm going to call you from the next one.  All right, call from a better line.  Should we do line of the day as they set up for this showstopper?  Stretch. 
[03:38:00]  Dude.  Fuck, man.  I'm disappointing my heroes.  Let me be.  Huh?  Remember this one?  My heroes.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me just play some music here.  Yeah, give me some 70s.  Listen to this.  Hold on.  No, 70s.  That's fucked up, man.  That's not right.  Fucking the whole music.  All right.  All right.  Are you guys getting a rod now? 
[03:38:30]  Sir.  You got to get off the speakerphone.  Are you off speakerphone?  Hold on.  I'm going to call you from this other phone.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  Do this, please.  Fuck.  313.  Fuck.  I'm calling 313.  My bad.  You just got to get off the speakerphone.  That's all.  Because we can't hear it.  It's like echoey.  No.  I forgot.  Anthony.  Mr.  Dude, you fuck about as well as you dial.  You're off the speakerphone?  Yes, sir.  I'm off the speakerphone. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  Let me talk to the girl there.  Talk to her, man.  That's Anthony.  I'm here.  Hello?  All right.  Is the guy in front of you?  Are you giving him a blowjob?  Well, yeah.  I'm not even sure who am I talking to.  Yeah, this is Anthony.  Here's what I want you to do.  Don't say anything, okay?  Now, listen.  Keep the phone by your ear.  Can he hear you right now?  Yeah.  Can he hear us?  I mean, can he hear us?  No.  Okay.  Listen, Vern.  Here's what you got to do.  This is key. 
[03:39:30]  Keep the phone by your ear.  Don't repeat.  And start giving him a blowjob right now, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Do that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now.  Are you blowing him?  Are you blowing him?  No.  Okay.  Now, when I tell you, bite the head of his dick, okay?  Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  You got to do it.  I'm not talking until it bleeds, but just bite it.  Just a little.  So he kind of yelps, okay?  It'll be great.  It'll be really funny.  Ready?  Bite. 
[03:40:00]  Bite it.  Come on.  Don't be such a faggot.  Come on.  Bite.  Bite it.  You're talking to your face, dude.  Look at what he's talking to you like you're a pig.  Bite it.  Would you bite his dick?  Miss, it's a joke.  Just bite it.  Don't hurt him.  Uh-huh.  Bite it.  Uh-huh.  Bite it so he fucking yells a little. 
[03:40:30]  She's just a good coxer.  Why does she have to be such a trooper?  Really?  She's like me with that stupid phone call yesterday.  She won't do the joke.  It's your Jessica Alba, dude.  Sure it is.  Denied.  Hey, dummy, are you listening? 
[03:41:00]  Bite his dick.  You're listening to me right now.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  You have to do this.  Just bite his dick.  Or flick his ball with your finger hard.  It would be the highlight of the week.  Come on.  Would you bite his dick already?  If I bite him, he's going to get to the wall.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you are dumbest fucking broad out there. 
[03:41:30]  Give me this to be proud of me.  All right.  Come in her eyes until she's blind.  Wait a minute.  She's getting fucked now.  Hope so.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Fuck it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, of course.  Is she saying aye, poppy?  Oh, okay. 
[03:42:00]  I'm here.  Aye.  Aye, poppy.  Ugh.  Not like Daddy.  Hey, I'm here.  I'm here.  Gentlemen?  Yes.  Just switch it up for this.  We're ahead of the cat box.  What are you?  Taking center field? 
[03:42:30]  Hold on.  Give me a second.  Give me a second.  Here, baby.  Hey, dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Yes.  Yes.  Jimmy.  Sir?  Jimmy.  Mister?  Sir?  Yeah.  All right.  Can she hear me or no?  No, she can't.  No, no.  Why are you fucking her?  She's giving me a ball back.  All right.  Just yell out the wrong name. 
[03:43:00]  Oh.  Jessica.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, so...  Come on.  Tell him how's it done.  Come on, man.  What?  What, is she sucking your dick?  She wants to stop for some fucking wine.  Is she sucking your dick?  She wants to...  I'm not blowing you, Clemenza.  Little wine, some sugar.  Come on, Jimmy.  You're slipping, you sausage.  What are you, Dan Schoen?  Just do your job.  Suck my cock.  Are you fucking her? 
[03:43:30]  No, I'm getting my nop polished.  All right.  Ah.  Okay.  Tell her to finger your ass a la Caligula.  No, no.  She'll lick, man.  I don't go for the yo.  Come on, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  I'm with you to a certain extent, pal.  Tell her to lick between your cheeks.  Let's play guess what you had for dinner yesterday.  Hold on.  She said lick between the cheeks, guy.  Yeah, big guy.  Hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She said she'd never done this before. 
[03:44:00]  Tell her to hurt me.  Just do it.  It's all right.  Be a, be a, be mean.  That's a little bit.  Knock your ass.  Hey.  How are you licking?  Don't.  Come on.  She's getting shy on me all of a sudden.  Oh, what?  She don't want to lick your ass?  Maybe it stinks.  She just doesn't, she doesn't want to call Jimmy's name out while she's doing it.  I don't blame her.  Does your crack stink?  Probably.  She was probably on the exercise bike yesterday for three hours. 
[03:44:30]  You guys suck, man.  This crack is awful.  All right.  Hey, why don't we do line of the day and get the hell out of here?  Thank you, mister.  That was good.  Sorry, man.  Sorry.  No, it was fine, man.  It was all right.  You did all right.  Too fat.  See you, bro.  Thank you.  Good night, brother.  That was a good one.  Too fat, everyone, from Hoboken.  He was a good boy.  One runner-up line of the day brought to you by Bodogfight.com.  We did that once.  It was very funny.  We got the girl on the phone and she bit the guy's dick.  And it was hysterically fucking yelled.
