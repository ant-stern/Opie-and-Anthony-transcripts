<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an explanation for the previous day's abrupt ending: a pre-recorded interview with Ricky Gervais for his HBO show, *Talking Funny*, featuring Seinfeld, Louis C.K., Chris Rock, and studio guests Jay Moore, Ronnie B., and Paul Reiser.  The hosts then transitioned into their "wrestler death clock" segment, lamenting the high mortality rate among professional wrestlers, specifically mentioning the deaths of Sean Osborne, Sir Oliver Humperdinck, and another unnamed wrestler.  This segued into a discussion of Scott Hall's substance abuse and a video showcasing his decline, alongside similar struggles faced by Jeff Hardy and the suicide of Larry Sweeney (including a mention of a promotional clip featuring Sam Roberts and the deceased Sweeney).

A substantial portion of the show focused on Bruce Kelly, a former Sirius XM employee,  featuring anecdotes about his outrageous publicity stunts (like jumping into a Jell-O vat) and a clip of his emotional reaction to a Who concert.  Past Opie and Anthony stunts were also recounted, including No Filter Paul's laxative incident and the infamous "Petrified Duty" involving Tippy Tom's feces.  A lengthy clip of a Bruce Kelly interview with Bob Kelly was played and analyzed, highlighting Bob Kelly's attempts to mimic the Opie and Anthony style.  The hosts also reminisced about their former Sirius XM boss, Elo, and his current employment with Oprah.

Rich Voss, a frequent guest, joined the show for a lengthy segment.  Voss shared eccentric stories from his daily life, including encounters at Walmart, Dunkin' Donuts, and toll booths, often embellished with his fabricated persona as an FBI profiler. He detailed his golf habits, his methods for obtaining free rounds, and his relationship with his wife, Bonnie.  The conversation included graphic sexual content and jokes.  Voss also discussed his recent acquisition of a used iPad, a video he made of Gervais and Louis C.K., his movie about whether women are funny, and his opinions on Tiger Woods's performance at the Masters.  Sam Roberts' promotional announcement for a wrestling event was also aired.  This segment included numerous crude and sexually suggestive remarks.

A later segment continued the discussion with Rich Voss, delving into his financial struggles, challenges of self-booking, and arguments with his wife, Bonnie, including sexually charged discussions and suggestions of potential physical altercations. The conversation touched on his recent expensive iPad purchase from Bob Kelly, an encounter with a fan with a disfigured face, and upcoming gigs in Salt Lake City.  Jay Moore's arrival in the studio led to a chaotic exchange, marked by past conflicts over finances, a previous comedy tour, accusations of credit exploitation, and a physical altercation.  A Jersey lawyer called in to discuss the legality of using "Last Comic Standing" for a tour.

The show further progressed with a focus on Jay Moore's tendency to dominate conversations, prompting discussion among the hosts and a caller, Matty, who praised Jay's talent but urged him to allow others to speak.  This transitioned to ridicule of Rich Voss's library visit with his daughter and his spelling, followed by mockery of a subsequent soup tasting event.  Discussions then covered a planned "Car Crash Comedy Tour," logistical issues, high theater costs, John from Staten Island's concern about Jay's behavior (speculating on substance use), Jay's recovery and current marijuana use, his custody arrangements,  Jim Norton's alleged affair with Rich's ex-wife, Rich's gum-chewing habit, Mitt Romney's presidential exploratory committee, and the Long Island serial killer.  Further tangents included Jim Norton's stand-up tour, a disputed joke, Jim's radio aversion, Jay's drug use, and personal anecdotes from the hosts and guests regarding gambling, pornography, and encounters with security guards. The segment ended with discussions of Twitter, online criticism, and a future segment showcasing Rich's briefcase.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment focusing on Rich Voss's frustrations with Twitter's negativity, contrasting it with his successful live performances.  The discussion included Voss's appearance, musical preferences, promotion strategies for Salt Lake City shows, and several caller interactions.  The segment featured extensive offensive language, insults, and crude jokes, and brief mentions of other comedians (Josh Blue, Bobby Slayton) and TV shows (*Watch What Happens Live*, *Project Runway*). The show ended with promotional announcements for Voss and Jim Norton, and a short, unrelated interview segment with Elizabeth Berkley.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  The crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Every morning is a good morning, I like to say.  Jim Norton and I.  Or is it Jim Norton and me?  Or is it me and Jim Norton?  It might be Jim Norton and me.  I don't know.  That means your name's first.  Or Jim Norton and I.  Yes.  As well as Jim Norton.  I mean, that's how I say it. 
[00:01:30]  Jim Norton and I.  Who am I kidding?  Jim Norton and me.  No, I think and I is actually the proper one.  Jim Norton and I?  I think so, yeah.  I just like me and blank.  Yeah.  It's the easiest way to do that shit.  No?  Even though it's not proper.  I like to speak properly.  So, yesterday, I guess we've got to start by talking about the end of yesterday's show.  Because so many people are so confused out there, Jimmy.  They're just very confused.  They're panicking.  They're very worried and they're panicking.  Yesterday we had an all-star lineup, let's be honest with you. 
[00:02:00]  I mean, if Anthony was here, it would truly have been an all-star lineup.  But with that said, we had Jay Moore, Jim Norton.  Look, I'm pointing because I'm trying to remember where everyone was sitting.  Ronnie B. and Louis C.K.  And also, Paul Reiser was a throw-in.  Just a little throw-in.  You know, a big network star.  He wasn't even part of the all-star lineup yesterday.  And we were having a damn good show yesterday.  And for the people out there, we set up a Ricky Gervais interview. 
[00:02:30]  And I don't even know how much we were allowed to say.  But now that it's done, I guess we could talk a little bit more about it.  Ricky Gervais is promoting this HBO show, Funny...  Funny Talking Funny or Funny Talk?  Holy shit.  Talking Funny, I believe.  It's going to be on HBO April 22nd.  So, according to Roland, Ricky only picked about five places he wanted to promote this thing.  We're the only radio show.  He said no to Howard.  And I don't even know where else.  A few TV spots and us is it. 
[00:03:00]  Because we're learning that Ricky's a very loyal guy.  And he likes us.  He's had a good time with us in the past.  So he said, absolutely, I'll go on their show.  But here's the deal.  I have to come in on Monday.  And they can't run it until after my David Letterman appearance.  And that, by the way, is a Letterman stipulation.  That's not about radio.  But Dave wants to be the first guy who you do the press with when you do him.  And it's just guys like him or the Tonight Show, it's just what they can do when they do it. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  So, of course, we're going to agree to that.  Sure.  We rarely tape any interviews.  We've done them here and there over the years.  I don't even remember the last one we've done.  It's been a while, I think.  Dude, I don't remember.  I'm sure you guys have done them.  This is the first one in all the years I've been with you that I can remember doing.  Here and there.  And probably we haven't done it in many years.  You're right.  So, of course, we said yes to that.  Yeah.  The other thing was, because he had all the press, he said he could only tape the interview at 10 o'clock, Monday morning.  So that's why the show ended abruptly yesterday. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I would have loved to have kept going.  Absolutely.  But you missed nothing because everything that we did is going to air.  Right.  Of course.  But people were bitching and complaining like, man, you had all those great people in there.  Why would you end the show like that?  We had no choice.  Yeah.  And it had to go to the supercomputer and start the best of or whatever.  But we stayed right where we were in our seats and we continued to the show for at least another hour.  I think we did at least an hour.  At least an hour.  And it felt very, very comfortable.  And normally, just knowing that people are listening means something. 
[00:04:30]  It really does change your vibe.  Yeah, absolutely.  But with everybody in the studio, when Ricky came in, it was fucking great.  Him and Louie were just attacking each other.  They're very good friends.  Yeah, I feel like everyone heard this already because we're sitting where we usually sit.  But, no, yeah, it's going to air later this week.  Yes.  And the chemistry that Louie and Ricky have is great.  And, you know, there were times where we're all just staring at them, just, you know, do their thing.  So that's why the show ended at 10 yesterday.  And you're going to hear it. 
[00:05:00]  And we agreed to it just because we love Ricky Gervais and he agreed to do the show.  So, yeah, of course we're going to take it.  Right.  So I think it's going to air Friday.  That was what motivated me to come in this week.  Right.  We opened it.  Maybe we'll do Monday, Tuesday.  I'm like, I was supposed to go to L.A.  Yeah.  Like, ah, and then they roll it so we can get Ricky on Monday.  Right.  But it's a pre-tape and we're like, okay, we came in for that.  You have to do that.  That's the only reason we came in this week.  We would love to be off this week.  And, actually, we came in today because we have a big interview with Rich Voss.  So we said, you know what, we have to do another day of radio before we step aside and take a little break. 
[00:05:30]  Yes, it's also a pre-tape.  We're taping it today to air at an undetermined date.  Yeah.  And that date may never be determined.  It may never be determined.  So then, you know, then I try to do the right thing and explain this stuff on Twitter.  And then people are like, well, why would you do that?  And I tweeted some, like, are there really people this dumb in the world?  Because I just explained it.  I just explained the whole thing.  It was right there for you to read.  To answer your question, yes, there are.  That's what a bunch of people said. 
[00:06:00]  I hope I hate to tell you, but yes, there are a lot of really dumb people out there.  So that's what happened yesterday.  It was fun, man.  Gervais was hilarious.  You know, again, you'll get all of it.  You'll hear the whole hour.  And it's a show on HBO where he interviews.  It was like him, Seinfeld, Louis C.K., and Chris Rock talking comedy.  Right.  And it was amazing how it just started mid-conversation.  It's a great thing on HBO, just a conversation between four comics about comedy.  It's not like Tough Crowd. 
[00:06:30]  I was worried it was going to be like a Tough Crowd thing, but it wasn't.  That would bother you, wouldn't it, Jimmy?  No, I mean, if it wasn't done right, it would annoy me just because Tough Crowd's not around.  But it was not like that.  It was just a different tone.  It was a really, really interesting discussion.  Like Chris and Jerry, you could see the differences in their stand-up and their philosophies about stand-up.  It was really, really well done.  The only thing I wish I asked Ricky yesterday, who was his influences?  We never got to that.  I know.  That was the only thing.  Because, you know, he's from across the pond.  I could have talked to him for another hour. 
[00:07:00]  He's one of the greatest interviews ever.  He could just talk about anything.  Yeah, and then he looked at me afterwards and he said, you're going to cut all that down.  I'm like, no way.  We're airing that entire hour.  Everything.  With all the scars and bruises.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Vince, thank you, Vince and Bayonne.  He writes, you explained why you ended the show at 10 at least three times yesterday.  So people heard the explanation yesterday, but still were confused.  And they'll be confused even though we just explained it again.  If people didn't listen to your explanation, they're stupid. 
[00:07:30]  Like, why would you cut off Louie?  We got the rest of the Louie interview.  Yeah, technically we didn't cut out anything.  Nothing.  He was here for the...  He came because Ricky was going to be here and it was just kind of like a fun additional thing.  It's like we took a commercial break yesterday and then four days later you get to hear the rest of the conversation.  Look, it's a little weird, I'll admit, but we got it.  It didn't feel weird doing it though, I guess because the energy of all the guys in here.  It felt very comfortable.  Yeah.  Also bummed that we didn't get to talk to Dave Grohl yesterday. 
[00:08:00]  That would have been nice.  You know, I haven't talked to him in years, but we talked to him, I don't know, at least four, I would say at least four times when we were at AAF when he was just getting the Foo Fighters thing going.  You know, we supported him big time.  He showed up at events and he was on our rock bus and he was just a great guy.  And I think we talked to him also once at NAW early on.  It's been many, many years, but it just bums me out.  And some of these guys, you know, you had a great time with when they were first starting out their new project. 
[00:08:30]  Obviously, Dave Grohl was fucking famous with Nirvana, but kind of needed a little help to get the Foo Fighters off the ground.  It's laughable to hear that right now, I know.  But there was a time, you know, that the Nirvana guys were really hoping they could continue with other bands.  And it certainly didn't work with the other guy.  Chris?  Chris, yeah, it didn't work with him.  He turned out to be a politician in Seattle.  But, you know, Dave Grohl used to call us all the time.  And to see him wandering around here and knowing that he could give a fuck about us is kind of a bummer. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's kind of a bummer.  I had a thing set up where I was going to get a photo with the Foo Fighters as a band.  And I wanted that.  Yeah.  But I couldn't walk out of the Gervais interview.  Yeah.  It's the first time I've done that.  It's like, that's how much I respect that for Ricky Gervais.  I couldn't.  There's very few guys who I couldn't walk out of for a minute.  Right.  To get a shot with the Foo Fighters, I just can't walk out of Ricky Gervais.  I can't do it.  Was it killing you?  No.  I didn't think of it.  I didn't care.  Because to me, Ricky's more important than the Foo Fighters. 
[00:09:30]  Foo Fighters will be around again.  Yeah.  They like this place.  They did a bunch of stuff for Sirius XM.  They did Howard, and I think they took over Alt Nation.  They're supposed to take over Alt Nation for four days, and they recorded it in one hour.  I love tearing down the walls.  In one hour, they were able to do four days of programming.  That's how important your job is on radio.  I love when people take over a station.  They don't take it over.  Of course they don't.  They read a bunch of stuff.  It takes them ten minutes.  You know?  I was listening to Hits One one day, and Selena Gomez took over for, what, the whole countdown 
[00:10:00]  or something?  I'm like, she didn't take over.  She's not sitting there while the fucking music is playing waiting to talk again.  She is.  Oh, she is, Sam?  Are you representing fucking Hits One?  Selena Gomez hung out all weekend that weekend.  Yeah.  She did?  Yep.  She did, huh?  Yep.  Who got her the coffee and stuff and kept her going?  Between songs, she just ran down to the kitchen and got some coffee and then was back to jock.  And she couldn't even leave here.  She couldn't go to a hotel or nothing, right? 
[00:10:30]  No.  She was like a slave.  And she just knew little factoids about every artist, too.  It was just all off the top of her head.  It's just amazing how that happens.  Radio's just amazing.  It's great stuff.  Radio is so magical.  I mean, yeah, Jim, you should get the Foo Fighters when they're back for those four days.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Yeah, when they're taking over.  Yeah.  When they take over, what, All Nation?  Yeah.  I love All Nation, but...  I heard the PD for All Nation is getting nervous, though, because he's like, geez, these guys are taking over.  For four days, we get to see them wandering around the halls?  Yeah, they're going to be like jocks. 
[00:11:00]  Nice.  Can we maybe go on All Nation with them and just say hi?  It's up to them.  They're taking over.  And just, I want to be needy and go, Dave, remember me?  He wouldn't fucking recognize me if I walked by him.  It's just so weird how this business is.  There was a time, hey, guys, how you been?  It's been a while.  It's the worst.  But he kind of meant it back then.  Because AF was a really important station for breaking a lot of new bands, because I could get into some philosophy here, but whatever. 
[00:11:30]  But they didn't care about ratings as much, because we had a weird signal.  So that allowed a radio station to take more chances.  You know what I mean?  What's the radio stations do now?  Not that they were taking chances with Foo Fighters.  I mean, there was a buzz that this band could work.  Dude, I'm really not familiar with their music.  Really?  No.  I don't, what I've seen of them I liked, but I mean.  Yeah, they got some great songs.  They were very good.  And fucking Dave Grohl was extremely talented.  Isn't that just flat out lying to your customers?  What, the takeover? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, it kind of is.  I don't think so.  The radio's very magical.  That's what I want everyone to know today.  It's very magical.  A silly question, right?  If we want to basically do anything, we need to go through a thousand layers of legal and everything.  But how could you just say that you're having this huge band, they're going to DJ for four days?  Like, you're just lying.  Like, where's the fucking fine print for that?  I don't know.  You're just lying to a whole bunch of people.  You're so right.  Two million people.  You're like, yeah.  Yeah, where is the fine print?  You're right.  If we want to do something, there's a lot of fine print. 
[00:12:30]  It's over the dumbest things.  You're right.  No, it's magical, though.  I mean, you've got the Foo Fires, and they're going to be.  When is this happening?  It's going to be very exciting around here for four days.  Yeah, I'm not sure yet, but it'll be a takeover.  We'll all realize it when it's happening.  Yeah, let me know, please, Sam.  And Sam, I guess while you're on mic, you killed the wrestler, huh?  No, I didn't kill anybody.  The wrestling, you know the wrestling death clock there, Jimmy?  Yes, I do.  Or the wrestler death clock?  We have to reset it?  Yes, we do have to reset it. 
[00:13:00]  Now, the bit has been, when did we start this bit?  A couple years ago?  Yeah, at this point, it must have been two years ago, probably.  Two years ago.  Okay.  And the bit was simple.  Can we go 100 days without a wrestler dying?  Yeah.  And there's been some wrestlers that we haven't even added to our list because they were kind  of fringe wrestlers.  Yeah.  They had to be, they had to be, they had to be a name where, you know, most people would  recognize in the wrestling community, right? 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Or, or either that or like, they had a career and they died very young.  Okay.  So.  And we, once again, have to reset the clock and once again, we have not gone 100 days  without a wrestler dying.  No, everybody thought we had because we hadn't mentioned it on the air, but, you know, we  just didn't bring it up.  Of course, I think the last one was in September.  That was the last time we did this?  The last one we mentioned.  Okay.  That was when, uh.  And then it was a bit we don't really feel like doing. 
[00:14:00]  Because it's like, yeah, we know, they just keep dying.  Right.  So, all right, the last time we talked about this was September.  Yeah, that's when we went 73 days.  Hey, that's not bad.  That's, that's a long time.  And the 73 days between who and who?  That was between Giant Gonzalez.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  We went 11 days.  11.  Yeah.  Between.  That's a lot different than 73, Sam.  Well, we went 73 after him.  Okay.  It was Bastion Booger.  And then 11 days later, the Giant Gonzalez. 
[00:14:30]  The Giant Gonzalez.  Yeah.  That's when we went 73 days before King Curtis Ikea died.  But he was 78.  So that was okay.  That's not, that shouldn't count then.  Because that's, that's like a normal age to die.  People, they do die.  Yeah, but.  They have to die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I mean, if you go with Major League Baseball, they could easily go 100 days without any  baseball player, you know, new or old.  Probably.  So I think we're, we should just throw the old guys in there because that's fair enough. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  So, 51 days after King Curtis Ikea, it was Sean Osborne.  He was not a big guy, but he was in developmental for WWE.  He was in their farm system for two years, and he was 34.  What did he die of?  Suicide.  Why the suicide?  It sounded like he had a good life going.  No, he was.  He was going to be called up to the majors.  Well, he was in the farm league for two years and then got cut.  Oh, all right.  Oh, no.  So he didn't have a lot going on, I guess.  Okay.  How depressing. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  It seems like a very depressing business.  How many years after he got cut did he kill himself?  Well, he got cut in 2008, and then he killed himself in January of this year.  11.  Okay.  All right.  Made a couple years.  34?  Yeah.  34, yeah.  And then 53 days after that, it was Sir Oliver Humperdinck.  Wait, these are all wrestlers since September?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  March 9th.  And these are known wrestlers? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Sir Oliver Humperdinck?  Oh, he's not known.  He was a known.  No, he's not.  You think Sam just wants this bit to continue?  Is that what you're saying?  I would rather go the 100 days.  Remember, radio's very magical.  This is some of the magic right here.  Sir Oliver, see, there's pictures of him.  He was a manager.  Was he in the WWE?  Oh, yes.  Okay, then he's, that's fair enough.  He was in the 80s.  How old was he?  He was 62.  There's two dead people right there.  Oh, yeah, Bam Bam Bigelow? 
[00:16:30]  He was Bam Bam Bigelow's manager.  And they're both dead.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  He was 62.  He died of pneumonia.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Uh, it's funny.  I got a...  Yeah.  Pneumonia, huh?  Sir Oliver Humperdinck.  Did he like half slices?  I don't know how much of a slice he ate.  Did he like half slices?  It'll be...  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's always the worst. 
[00:17:00]  That's like the fucking code word.  Wait, isn't he the dude that used to work for XM?  Who?  The fucking who guy.  No, I don't think he is.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  Bruce...  Uh, fuck.  What the fuck?  Bruce Kelly.  Bruce Kelly.  Yeah.  Can you play Bruce Kelly for me?  I don't give a fuck.  We're in the middle of the wrestling bit.  Bruce Kelly is the greatest thing to ever happen to satellite radio.  It's not us.  It's not Howard.  It's Bruce Kelly.  And the day he cried over the who is the greatest moment on satellite radio. 
[00:17:30]  I challenge you to find a better moment.  Through your tears.  Full clip is one minute.  We got nothing but time to waste, sir.  Hit that fucking thing.  Bruce Kelly, everyone.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone talks.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player. 
[00:18:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was, uh, that's, uh, this is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  But, uh, it was just very, I mean, you know, it's just the who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the who.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live. 
[00:18:30]  I guess that was in color.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens,  too, so, uh.  Through your toes.  Wow.  So there's, uh, two more to go here, uh, at Hyde Park and the crowd.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry.  Really?  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this, you know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  You know what makes that clip great?  Many things.  Many things.  What did you enjoy this time?  Well, unfortunately, um, George Taylor Morris is no longer with us, the guy with the great 
[00:19:00]  radio voice.  He was an amazing fucking guy, an amazing radio guy, smooth as fucking silk.  He interviewed us when we first came back to Satellite Radio.  He probably had, uh, he probably had stage three cancer when that was being recorded, and  he wasn't crying.  He wasn't crying over his cancer.  And here you got Bruce Kelly fucking losing it over the who.  And the best part was the silence, because they were just standing there.  And they would not bail him out.  And that was the beauty of that.  He was like, I'm absolutely crying. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  But then, nothing.  You could just see that they were just standing there with the mic, waiting.  Like, we're not going to help you out.  And it was such a great moment for Satellite that, uh, what XM did was made sure that fucking  Bruce Kelly hit the fucking bricks.  Get out of here.  They fucking got rid of Bruce Kelly, unfortunately.  He ran the 80s channel.  Yeah.  They didn't fire him for that.  Oh, this is a Bruce Kelly fun fact.  1997 became the first heterosexual to be grand marshal of a nationally recognized gay pride  parade after numerous gay public figures declined, and notably Arizona Congressman Jim Colby. 
[00:20:00]  That's a Bruce Kelly fun fact from his Wikipedia.  He did publicity stunts?  Ah, I love publicity stunts.  Me too.  Want to do one?  I'd love to.  It's been way too long.  Some of these are really good.  Yeah?  Some of the publicity stunts?  Well, when you're, I guess, the PD of 80s on 8, you got to really step up and be that  man.  Create some awareness.  Yeah, and you got to be in control, so.  Wasn't he also the guy that did, uh, Help Me Out?  What was the term we used? 
[00:20:30]  Bruce Kelly voiced?  Oh, interloculars?  Oh, God.  Fucking Danny just fell down.  Well, it's been a while since I had to say that fucking word.  Who came up with that?  Dude, I don't know, man.  He really wanted to do something like with it.  No, but I don't think he came up with that.  I think he did.  He voiced it.  He came up with that?  No, I think he did.  He may have.  I think that was a whole thing.  What was it interlocular?  Eric, maybe, am I wrong?  Like, didn't he want to be involved in, like, this was, like, his whole thing?  He sort of wanted to be a reporter within the Opie and Anthony show.  Like, he was going to report about. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, he wanted to be sad.  What our lives were, uh, what we do, uh, during the commercials, when the mics are off,  when the day's over, those kind of things.  Mm-hmm.  Too bad.  Not a bad concept.  Oh, but getting back to all these great publicity, uh, publicity stunts.  Yes.  Uh, let's see, once, uh, Bruce Kelly jumped in front, uh, he jumped into, excuse me, a  vat of 20,000 gallons of orange Jell-O.  I mean, that's crazy.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty crazy, Jimmy.  If you want people to listen to, you know, some Michael Jackson songs, that's the kind  of shit you got to do.  You got to give it to them on that.  But that was back in the day. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to slow down a little bit, Jimmy.  Would you do the Jell-O stuff?  I've been thinking of, imagine doing that, and then realizing that you couldn't pull  your way up and dying.  How humiliating.  Drowning in Jell-O?  Oh, how embarrassing.  How many feet of Jell-O?  It would be impressive, like Jimmy's saying, if it was 70 feet of Jell-O.  Well, it had to be a considerable amount, because there's, it says it was 20,000 gallons  of orange-flavored Jell-O.  That's a huge amount of gallons.  20,000 gallons.  Yeah.  All right.  It's got to be a lot.  I don't know.  I can't really visualize that.  Why would you do 20,000 gallons? 
[00:22:00]  To create awareness.  You only need a few gallons.  I hate things, by the way, that create awareness.  I hate when they're done to create awareness.  You just got to get the people talking.  Like, who is that guy?  Oh, now that you mention it, he's the PD for 80s on 8.  80s on 8, where can I hear this?  Boom, XM.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Do we have any examples of creating awareness?  We have so much to do to that.  Well, you know what?  Since it was just on the show, like, last week, how about Whoopi Goldberg with those  fucking piss diapers? 
[00:22:30]  That's creating awareness.  That's right.  Old women pee themselves.  Whoopi created awareness.  We created awareness when we had No Filter Paul walking down 57th Street shitting himself.  The show creates awareness with Whip about Wednesday.  We got to spread the word about titties.  But you think we can do the No Filter Paul bit again?  No!  I bet.  No, we can pull it off.  We can do it.  We'll just get in trouble afterwards.  Was he actually shitting while he was walking down the sidewalk?  I know he shit when he got to XM.  Yeah, he was shitting down his legs while he was walking down 57th Street. 
[00:23:00]  For the newer listeners, because we're gaining them every day.  You bet we are.  What did we do?  We fed him what?  I forgot the name of the product.  I don't remember the, yeah, I don't remember it either, but apparently it makes you shit  real fast.  Yeah.  Really fast.  And in large amounts.  So we had him wear a diaper and then for the walkover we basically wanted him to shit  the entire way.  And then I remember we had to lay down paper like he was a dog when he got to XM.  We had a guy on 57th Street.  Isn't that video up there still somewhere?  Yeah, somewhere.  He was shitting in the studio.  That's what we did.  Why can't we do that anymore? 
[00:23:30]  Health code violations?  I don't know.  Yeah, but radio is magical.  That's true.  That's some magic right there.  You know, I don't know what made me think of it the other day, but that whole Tippy Tom  incident when he had just that, like, it was like dried clay in his underwear.  It's the best thing ever.  Did you pick it up?  I did.  No, I didn't.  The only reason I picked it up was, I picked it up because it was a rock to me.  That was one of the strangest things I've ever seen in my time.  Yeah, but it was made out of feces.  It was not. 
[00:24:00]  It wasn't a rock.  It was a rock.  It was bacterial.  It was hard duty.  It was like wood.  You know those hard wood chips that you decorate a front lawn with?  I'm sorry, but if you find the sound, because I banged it on the table, and I believe Pat  Duffy did as well.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, but you know.  That was a rock, and it would go through a window.  I'm telling you right now.  Just imagine your poo stays in your underwear long enough where you could throw it through  a window.  Right before.  It's petrified.  It's petrified.  Right before it made that sound on the table, it was in Tippy Tom's underpants, and it had 
[00:24:30]  come out of his bottom.  Yes.  That's where it was.  That's where he cut his underwear off.  It was becoming a diamond.  I had gloves on, silly goose.  I'm not that stupid, but I fucking had to pick that thing up.  Check it out.  You didn't have to.  Yeah.  You have to.  When's the next time you're going to see Petrified Duty?  There's a reason you don't see it.  It's disgusting.  Right, but that's a...  Because people flush it.  That's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  They typically leave it in the homeless underpants.  It's not a rare gem.  It's not a...  It's not something to be admired. 
[00:25:00]  As a matter of fact, I would probably avoid it upon sight.  I used to live near a gem store, and we'd go in and see all the rare gems.  I hate rare gems.  And then some of them would be made into little elephants and stuff, and we would buy rare  gems for our room.  But if I went in there and had Petrified Duty and a fucking glass case, I'd have to buy that.  You'd purchase it?  Yes!  What if it was from a homeless man?  That makes it better.  Oh.  He was an icon.  E-Rock, you've got to find the poo hitting the fucking table, and I'll prove it's a rock. 
[00:25:30]  And also, we need an interjocular whatever from Bruce Kelly.  I can't touch a snort of.  An interlocular.  Those are...  That's going way back, man.  Interloculars.  That was a long time ago.  Who were they exactly?  Those little...  They were stupid interviews that he thought that were in-depth and interesting.  Well, that was leading up to...  Wasn't that part of our big relaunch?  Yeah, it was...  When we finally came back to radio?  He did all these interviews with people associated to the show when we did that event at the Hard Rock. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, you know what it was?  Are you there?  I think it was more...  It was him really wanting to do something with the show, but having no idea what the show is about.  I don't think anybody asked him to do this.  Jesus, E-Rock hates Bruce Kelly.  I know.  What did he do to you?  Yeah, man.  He's out of work.  Or we're working at a shitty, lousy station somewhere.  Did he molest you to a Kaja Goo Goo song?  No, he used to...  Remember when he used to just show up?  He liked us.  Yeah, when we were on at 7 in the morning, he would just be there.  Two pieces of shit.  Oh, Spanny.  What?  Oh, boy. 
[00:26:30]  No one could see him.  I could.  What do you got, E-Rock?  I'm looking for the tippy-tom, but I have a Bruce Kelly interlocular with Bob Kelly.  Ah.  What?  It's three...  It's a little over three minutes.  No.  We can hear how about we get at the beginning of it?  Okay.  At the beginning, we should hear.  All right.  Because this is before Bob was really on the channel a lot, right?  Yeah, I think so.  It was basically a way to introduce everybody from the show, because we were going national  officially.  We were syndicated here and there to big cities, but this allowed us to be heard from coast 
[00:27:00]  to coast.  It was like an Opie and Anthony takeover.  Yeah.  I want to hear what stupid Bob sounds like when he was just getting indoctrinated.  O and A.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony were overpaid, but then again, so it was...  They are really lucky to have a job.  The worst of O and A.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  He's one of the Opie and Anthony virus freaks, and they're coming to get him right now. 
[00:27:30]  What's happening, man?  How do you feel about O and A now?  Pause this.  What's happening?  He's so happy to be there always.  They call him a virus freak, O and A freak.  Virus freak, right?  I don't know.  It further proves the point that Bruce Kelly, he had no idea.  Because Bob Kelly is a comedian, not like a sideshow.  I don't see the point of wanting to be associated with something that you just have no idea about. 
[00:28:00]  He was just trying to be like, to use crazy language, like O and A language.  Look, the cool kid showed up to town, and he was like, this is the train I got to get  on.  Wait till they hear my interjocular.  Joculars.  Get it right, Sam.  Sorry, dude.  Show some respect.  He thought he knew about us.  He had his...  Well, he had the exclusive with the O and A freak, Bob Kelly.  Let's continue.  Now this is good.  And they're coming to get him right now.  What's happening, man?  How do you feel O and A now on XM and totally uncensored, totally free? 
[00:28:30]  You're a stand-up comedian.  How does that let you loose here on O and A?  It's fantastic.  I'm so glad they're free.  Now I just want to know, do I get my two bucks back for the last eight months?  But yeah, it's fantastic.  I pause again.  This is going to take a long time.  I wish Bob Kelly was here.  Fuck, I wish Bob was in.  We should call him and make him come all the way in to the studio just so we can replay this  for him.  Dude, we know when this was, though. 
[00:29:00]  October of...  I can't believe it was October of 04.  No, no, no.  This was after October of 04.  And then we went free.  So this is right when they took us off the premium channel.  Right, right, right.  So I'm saying...  Oh, no.  We did it.  It was about...  It was somewhere around 2005.  Yeah, it's saying around March 2005.  That's what I was going to say.  Eight months after October.  That's when Elo came in and said, you know, what the fuck is this company doing?  You're just burying these idiots.  We got to, you know, put them front and center.  Elo saved our ass.  Yes, he did.  In the end, he was a corporate guy, but he was one of the better ones.  That's for sure.  He was great.  I told you I saw him in Chicago. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, his wife came to my show and I see him on TV.  Nobody recognized him there, though.  Where?  When I saw him at the show.  Really?  He came to see me, yeah.  Was he wearing his pink shirt?  He looked very thin.  But he is that guy, though, I'm saying.  He didn't just forget about us when he left.  He changed his life.  This place was killing him.  I've had conversations.  This place was killing him.  He was bloated.  He was a bloated alcoholic, losing his battle on life in general.  Didn't he crash a car even?  Did he?  Yes, he crashed his sports car. 
[00:30:00]  This place was killing him.  And then when he left, he got into that Oprah aura and changed his entire life.  That's what you're looking at.  Now he fucking runs road races.  He runs every day.  He doesn't drink, or if he does, very little.  I think he doesn't drink at all, actually.  I think not at all.  And he looks great.  And now he wears pink shirts for Oprah.  I'm like, who is this guy?  I just had a conversation with him yesterday on the phone.  Because I watched that behind-the-scenes Oprah show on OWN.  I know.  Say what you want.  But all of a sudden, I guess Oprah, every year for her birthday, the whole staff, you're looking at a billionaire. 
[00:30:30]  Oprah's a billionaire.  Every day, Oprah's birthday is a company holiday where everyone has to bring her a present for her birthday.  And then they all go into her office that looks like a living room.  This office is just amazing.  It's a great place to hang out because you don't feel like you're at work.  And then she sits there, and everyone, one by one, gives her a present.  And there's Elo with his pink shirt.  And his gift. 
[00:31:00]  Well, they didn't show his gift, so I wrote him.  I'm like, oh, you didn't get Oprah a gift?  He goes, oh, I got her a printer.  I'm like, that's fucking lame.  I know.  He goes, yeah, I know.  Write that off as a business expense?  Yeah.  Jacqueline, you're all going to use it in the office.  Yeah.  You want a printer for us.  I actually kind of like that she does that, though, because she takes her staff on, like, fucking cruises.  She treats her staff good.  She seems to be pretty cool.  Yeah.  You know, she lets her guard down for this kind of reality show they're doing.  I'm pretty amazed that she would do this after all these years.  But showing another side of her. 
[00:31:30]  The show, the network's struggling.  And Elo just shows up every once in a while.  And he's a guy among a bunch of broads.  Seems like he has a wonderful life over there.  Yeah, it's a lot easier than this.  They look up to him.  They think he's smart.  Well, he's the top dog.  Him and this girl, Sherry.  That's it.  And then above those two is just Oprah.  That's where he's at in the Oprah empire, our old boss.  There's nobody emailing him pictures of erections.  All right, let's.  Is he right under Oprah?  I mean, like, that's.  He started out two below her, and now he's one. 
[00:32:00]  What happened to the other person?  Did he pass him?  If Oprah moves on, then I guess it's Elo's show.  That would be great.  How does that work?  Yeah.  No, it's Sherry, who's been with Oprah for a long time.  And right by Sherry's side now is Elo.  And then Oprah.  That's it.  That's the pyramid over there.  Wow.  The structure of how that works.  Pretty amazing, isn't it?  He fucking certainly failed upward, as they say.  He sure did. 
[00:32:30]  Look at this place.  All right, back to the interlocular with Bob Kelly.  The ONA free.  Bucks back for the last eight months.  But, yeah, it's fantastic.  It should be free.  More people get to listen to these two gentlemen, Opie and Anthony, get more fans, and then they  can take over the world.  I think that's their plan, and be number one in the universe.  Why do you like being a part of the ONA show?  Because they have the best fans in the world.  They have the best fans.  No, I'm just kidding.  They don't.  Their fans are evil, atrocious creeps, but that's why I love them.  ONA, because they're the best. 
[00:33:00]  They're the best.  You get to say what you want.  They're the funniest thing on the radio.  The absolute truth.  You get to say what you want about fucking a sink.  Where else could I tell people that I fucked a sink when I was in Juvie Hall?  What show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  No.  The FCC and censors.  He just rambled.  Pause.  It's like he wants everyone to think that the Today Show just calls him on a regular basis,  but he can't tell that story.  How about this, Bob?  You can't tell any stories on the Today Show.  Because they never invited you. 
[00:33:30]  They don't want you.  Right.  You hear what he did there?  He's the big get out there in the world.  He's choosing.  But he's choosing which stories that he can tell only on Opie and Anthony.  Another story he can't tell on the Today Show is one where he rescued a baby from train  tracks.  Why?  Because they're not interested in talking to you.  There's nothing you have to say.  He ought to say, I can't tell this or any other story on the Today Show.  Because they've never called me.  They've never.  Never called you.  But he made the, let's tear down another wall.  He wants the listeners to think, he's the big get. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  So you're saying the honest answer would have been, I like doing the Opie and Anthony show  because they're the only show that will have me.  Yes.  But they're the only ones that will have me.  And I can tell my dirtier stories that if network television acknowledged me, wouldn't  let me tell.  Right.  But they don't.  They don't acknowledge me.  I can also tell my clean stories on Opie and Anthony too.  What?  I'm going to take that to the Today Show?  No, Bob.  You're really.  Yeah.  What am I going to do when I sit down with Matt Lauer?  I don't know.  I'll probably introduce yourself and explain why you're there.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  I wish Bob was here so I could punch him in the face.  Or maybe he's hoping that, you know, when Al Roker does his weather, he's in the background  and he can hopefully try to tell the story before they cut to the fucking sports.  Yeah.  You know, Al.  Boom.  Don't.  Fucking to sink.  You know.  You're drizzling cum.  He's trying to use, like, weather terms.  Right.  Oh, he's the worst.  All right.  Go back to the interlocular.  What show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  No.  The FCC and censorship on the radio. 
[00:35:00]  I think that satellite radio is the new cable, you know, like cable television, man.  You finally get to hear what people really think.  And creeps like me get to get on the radio, finally.  You know how many terrestrial radio shows I've done?  And how to talk about how my mother used to hit me as a kid.  And I actually told one time, I told this story when I was in juvie, how I used to fuck a sink.  I get a lot of emails now about people, and they got it all wrong.  They think I actually fucked the whole sink or actually fucked the drain of the sink, which is physically impossible. 
[00:35:30]  I actually just lied on top of the sink, put my hand on the edge of the sink, well lubricated, and then I pushed my mule inside of my hand.  And the sink, all it was, was leverage.  It was just leverage.  It was a place that I could put my hand where it would be sturdy enough.  I could just pump it.  Me pumping the hand instead of the hand pumping me.  So it's actually like you're having sex.  They're in fucking the sink.  So please do it right. 
[00:36:00]  I don't want people getting hurt trying to fuck the drain of a sink.  30 seconds.  Tell me about OB.  By the way, 30 seconds of rambling audio is about to come.  Well, that was pretty rambling, too.  That was horrendous, but at least it had a point.  30 seconds.  I saw what Bruce just said.  Yeah.  This is not going to be good.  Ah, dude, they're, uh, he's just going to riff.  You know, dude, you're crazy.  Hey, uh, well, those two, don't you be committed?  Oh, this is going to be humiliating.  Yeah, Bruce Kelly is the no editing key. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, he really does just leave it all in, doesn't he?  You edit, right?  You're the editing key.  Well, I edit occasionally, but I only edit pauses.  Like, I edit all spaces between words.  So it's one long word with no space, no pause, no punctuation.  That would be a nightmare.  It would be horrendous.  Can we have an example of that?  Well, just like, as we're talking right now, if I edited that, it would be, well, just  as we're talking right now, if I edited that, it would be horrendous.  It would just be awful.  But, uh, I've never gotten over the Bob Kelly, uh, sync thing. 
[00:37:00]  I forgot about it.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh, then this is good.  We're playing it.  If you forgot, then some listeners forgot.  Oh, definitely.  I've never heard this before.  That's a weird one, isn't it?  We've all stuck our penises in some weird shit, but that sync thing is strange, man.  Would you do that?  No.  Why would you do that?  No.  Wouldn't the sync be cold to begin with?  Depends.  It was a cold, maybe.  A what?  Coal.  K-O-H-L.  Sink brand.  Jesus. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Back to the interlocutor.  You're about to hear Bob Kelly explain the show in 30 seconds.  And go.  Trying to fuck the drain of a sync.  30 seconds.  Tell me about Opie and Anthony.  These two guys are actually breaking ground, making new radio, making history, along with  Jim Norton.  They're actually saying how they feel about things instead of saying what other people  think they should say about stuff.  They're truth tellers.  They're prophets.  They're actually close to Jesus Christ of modern day age.  They give men what they want. 
[00:38:00]  Boobs on the highway every Wednesday.  God bless them.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Bob Scott, you're great.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  Bob Scott.  Bob Scott.  That made it worse.  Bob Kelly's so forgettable.  Bob Scott.  In this interview, Bobby.  In this interview.  Relax.  Bob Scott.  Where does Bob Scott come from?  Is that the end of that? 
[00:38:30]  No, there's still about 25.  Oh, why?  Because now Bob Kelly has to give him a beating.  All right.  Let's finish this up.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Bob Scott, you're great.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil right now.  Bob Scott.  With my fucking pencil right now.  With my fucking pencil.  Why is he going to stab him with my fucking pencil?  Can we hear that again?  With my fucking pencil.  Fucking what happened to Bob?  He's playing bagpipes. 
[00:39:00]  He's hot under the collar.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil.  With my fucking pencil.  I'm going to stab you with my pencil.  I'm Bob Scott.  Is that it?  No, there's a tiny bit more.  There you go.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil right now.  Bob Scott.  You stink.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM 202. 
[00:39:30]  High voltage.  Super.  They're going to be confused that we're in Best that we're not.  That was an old fucking clip that we had to play today.  You should tell yourself, old clip of high voltage.  High voltage.  I hated that.  Well, stupid lawyer.  Lawyer lady.  I ended up liking her in the end, but she had no business being part of radio.  She helped me.  I liked her, too.  I liked her, but she was a good lawyer, but she wasn't good at radio. 
[00:40:00]  And I remember we were doing the press conference, and she was on an Xcella.  She called me.  She said, we need a name for the channel.  I said, okay, give me a day.  I'll figure something out.  I'll get with Jimmy and Ann, and we'll figure some shit out.  And by the time the fucking Xcella pulls into Penn Station, and she gets to the press conference,  she goes, we're going to call it high voltage.  I'm like, that's the worst name ever, because we're trying to get away from the shock jock thing,  because that's based on a shock jock thing, right?  High voltage.  I'm like, it's stupid.  Well, also energy, but it's stunky, though. 
[00:40:30]  And then she goes, it's too late.  We already sent it to the printer.  I'm like, why did you even ask me then?  But I guess they decided on the train, and then they called somebody and got shit underway to be printed up.  I wanted to call it the Laugh-a-Palooza.  Not funny in any context.  Nope.  Voss is here.  Good for him.  Let him fucking wait.  We're taking a break in two minutes, and then we'll have Voss in here.  So where were we, Sam?  That was a little off-roading we did, huh? 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  Back to the rest of that.  We're that damn good.  So we're trying to do the wrestler death clock.  We want to go 100 days without a wrestler dying, and we haven't done the bit since September.  We can't even just throw it to the side, but now another guy just died, so now we're just getting an update.  Well, we never made the 100 days, as we said.  It's been progressively worse, and we had to reset the clock yesterday.  Oh, is that what we're up to now?  We made it to 33 days.  Who was the one before yesterday? 
[00:41:30]  Sir Oliver Humperdinck.  Oh, that was the guy with the Bruce Kelly guy?  Right.  Oh, okay.  And that's who took us down that road.  So then we went 33 days, and then we lost who yesterday?  Somebody who you guys spent a lot of time mocking about three years ago.  Really?  Bill Sherman?  Not Bill Sherman.  Wait, we mocked him on our show?  Very much.  I know this is a big wrestler because he was trending on Twitter yesterday, even though  I don't know anything about him, and I don't even remember that we mocked him.  Yeah, because...  I know the angle.  I know that you did a little something with this guy at an independent wrestling show. 
[00:42:00]  With sweet and sour Larry Sweeney.  Larry Sweeney.  Yeah.  Did we have him on the air?  Did he call in?  No, he never did.  We tried to get him on.  He never called in, but he was the one...  This was the first time I did a wrestling gig, so this was when I went in the ring and  did that horrible low blow, and then you guys spent about...  Remember the low blow?  No, I vaguely remember Sam doing the wrestling.  He had to jump in the ring, and then he did one of those low blow moves.  Yeah.  You actually did a move? 
[00:42:30]  They reserved that move for girls, but they gave it to Sam.  I crotched him.  Were you good?  I thought I was quite good.  Dude, you know Snooki was way more impressive in the wrestling ring than you, right?  Well, she had better training, I think.  She did some kind of fucking backflip.  Two backflips and then did some move.  But you know what?  When I came out to the ring, the fans cheered me, and when I left, they booed me, so I  did my job.  Wait, was Donald Trump still wrestling?  Look at that.  Yes.  Well, look at that.  Sam, like...  Wow.  Because Sam's so strong.  Ew.  He didn't throw that guy into the fucking ropes.  What are you doing? 
[00:43:00]  Is Larry Sweeney in this video here?  That's him on the mat right there.  Oh, really?  He's just standing there, some fucking kid that doesn't belong in the ring with his  hoodie on.  And then Sam's not sure if he's supposed to leave the ring.  Well, the dumb referee completely destroyed this spot.  When do you do the low blow?  Right before that.  Right before that?  Can we go back?  Yeah.  It was missable.  All right, so Larry Sweeney's in the ring.  This is...  Yeah, that's Larry Sweeney and the boxer is Larry Barnes. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, it was a wrestling boxing match?  Yeah.  So why didn't the boxer just punch the shit out of him?  He did in the end.  Referee went down.  Oh, there I go.  And he's helping the ref up.  Gotta check the referee.  Oh!  And there's Sam doing the chick move.  Sam does the low blow.  Wait, why are you cocking your fist?  And then you gotta hope that the guy gets up on his own because you can't lift him off  the mat.  No, I lifted him up and threw him into Pete Gass from the Mean Street Posse.  Oh, he was a big fucking WWF guy.  Yeah, Pete Gass.  That's my boy.  Do you think that when the box show and they're like, who has to push me? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  What?  No.  So you got involved with this nonsense.  It wasn't nonsense.  This was a wrestling show back in what, 2008?  2008, yeah.  We should get a couple of these videos on the Facebook page today.  Okay.  Has a lot of views.  It sure does, man.  8,000 views.  8,000.  Three years later.  Well, I mean, it hasn't been, it had its hit and its moment and then it, you know.  And then it just died in it like most videos. 
[00:44:30]  Well, it's not a viral phenomenon.  It should be.  You think so?  Well, if this Larry Sweeney guy was trending on Twitter yesterday, people would be searching  out the Larry Sweeney videos today.  Well, the real reason that you were making fun of both me and Larry Sweeney is because  this was also the first time I cut a wrestling promo to promote this gig and Larry Sweeney  was in the promo with me.  We got that.  We got the audio version.  And like I said, the video will be up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, in a little  bit.  So, uh, this guy is now dead. 
[00:45:00]  We're listening to a dead guy.  Yeah, he apparently hung himself at a wrestling school.  Wow.  And how old was he?  He was 29.  29?  What is going on with this?  I don't want to do this bit anymore.  It's sad.  It's fucking creepy.  It's weird.  It's not even fun.  He had problems.  A lot of those guys, I think, use substances, right?  Yeah, and he had, uh, he had some mental problems.  He had to leave wrestling for a little while because apparently he had a breakdown and he  was bipolar.  Oh.  Oh, bipolar's the worst.  Is that the me, me, me people? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, fuck it.  Yeah, I mean, but they're also the rage issues and whatever.  They could, they just buy, you know, two poles.  It's nuts.  Are they the, uh...  Everything's just fine.  I'll fucking kill you!  Exactly.  Those people?  Yes.  Oh.  And that's what, because he had, everybody thought he was going to be like a big, he  was going to bring managers back because he was very talented.  They don't have managers anymore in wrestling?  Not really.  Hey, uh, you're a wrestling expert.  What happened to what's his name up there in, uh, Massachusetts? 
[00:46:00]  Who?  I don't know.  One of the...  Bedford Teddy.  I don't know.  You don't know the big wrestling story where they fucking, uh, took him 10 minutes to  get him out of the ring?  Oh, Scott Hall?  Scott Hall.  Scott Hall is like, he's Razor Ramon.  Razor Ramon has some major problems now, huh?  Yeah.  He used to be a big one in the wrestling world.  He was WWF, he was...  What else?  Yeah, NWR, WCW, everything.  But he's like a notorious substance abuser at this point.  He's had a lot of alcohol and substance-related problems. 
[00:46:30]  He's like Jake the Snake Roberts.  He's always fucked up somewhere.  He's kind of like the wrestler, right?  That's why the wrestler...  He's very similar to...  Except the wrestler didn't get fucked up all the time.  I, uh, a bunch of people tweeted the video and he looks like shit.  Yeah, he's falling down in the ring and he's slurring his speech and then the...  Can we find that video real fast for Jimmy?  The scumbag wrestling promoters, once this became a TMZ story, uh, took the event and  made it a pay-per-view on their website.  Oh.  So that you could all see Scott Hall and all those...  Oh, so we're not even gonna be... 
[00:47:00]  We're not gonna be able to see this clip anymore?  You could see the clips.  Yeah, it's really sad.  Yeah.  And then what's-his-name, uh, just disappeared and they're saying, is he even alive?  Who?  I don't know.  One of the tumblers from the WWF.  One of the tumblers?  Uh, help me out.  I forgot their names.  He had the weird fucking beard.  The chicks loved him.  He would climb the ladders.  Captain Lou.  Oh, Jeff Hardy.  Captain Lou.  Jeff Hardy.  Yeah, Jeff-  There's rumors that he's, uh, gone real bad, too. 
[00:47:30]  Jeff Hardy, he was main eventing a TNA pay-per-view and they had to end the match after one minute.  Why?  Apparently he was all fucked up and Sting wasn't gonna wrestle him, so he just threw him on  the mat and covered him.  And that was supposed to be the main event?  It was a pay-per-view main event.  The fans were outraged.  Oh, shit.  So, and no one has-  And he hasn't been on TV since.  No one has seen him since.  They shouldn't be bringing him to the paint.  They should be bringing him to a hospital.  I know.  This is Scott Hall. 
[00:48:00]  Maybe we could get this on our Facebook page.  This is unbelievable, this video, by the way.  You gotta see this.  And he's not putting on a bit.  No, no, no, no, no.  And I swear, this very morning I asked Sam about this video and I was like, what's the  deal?  Like, does he have some severe health problems or was he just really fucked up?  He gets really fucked up.  And you heard somebody-  I mean, he can't walk.  They did a-  This whole time he's just trying to get into the ring.  That's how fucked up he is.  And you heard somebody in the audience go, he shouldn't be going in the ring.  He should be going to the hospital.  Is he a trigger? 
[00:48:30]  That guy in the blue, he had to actually flip his leg over the middle rope.  Like, Scott couldn't even do it himself.  Holy shit.  And he goes-  This guy was fucking, and this guy was huge for many years.  He was a major star.  Was he?  Yeah.  What's his name?  He was Razor Ramon, and then he was Scott Hall.  I know defeated.  Chico!  And then it took, what, ten minutes to get him out of the ring, right? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, stumbling out.  And then there's another clip somewhere, unless they took it down, where he was in the ring  and actually trying to do a spot, and one of the guys just kind of shoved him, and he  just falls over.  It wasn't like he was taking a bump.  He just collapsed and fell over.  You think he tipped a few back?  Yeah, he had, even when he was, like, main eventing in WCW, he was coming out to the 
[00:49:30]  ring, and you could tell he was drunk.  They had to take him off TV eventually.  Like, he's another guy.  He would have been, like, even-  That's when I was watching wrestling, you know?  And that was a good time, because Scott Hall was so fucked up all the time.  And he would come to the ring and cup almost.  He was drunk.  Everybody loved him.  Like, he would have been an even bigger star.  Was he a big star?  He was a big star.  He was huge, man.  He was a really big star.  Because he had a tag team with Kevin Nash.  They were the outsiders.  That was, like, a big deal for a while.  What year was he big?  I was, like, 96, 97.  Yeah.  We were in Boston.  Yeah.  He was, as Razor Ramon, he was big from 94 to 96. 
[00:50:00]  And then in WCW, he was really big from 97 to 99.  So he had about a five-year run.  And he's too old now to recapture any of that, you think?  Yeah, and his health is just terrible.  Like, he's just a lot of years of major abuse.  That's why I don't want to do the wrestling bit anymore.  It's too real.  That guy could be dead any day.  He's fucked up.  I'm always amazed by guys who have a little bit of fame, or even a lot of fame, for a 
[00:50:30]  short period of time and blow it.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, if you fade away, you fade away.  But guys that blow it are always interesting to me.  He could, if he kept his...  That once, someone, Scott Hall...  This is when he was a main eventer.  Don't sing it.  Bring it.  So he...  He's doing his catcher.  He was drunk.  You could tell he's got two belts on.  Like, he was a main eventer, and they were letting him do this.  That's how big he was.  Oh, he's fucked up in this video, too?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he's been one of those fucked up guys for a while, but now it's catching up to him, huh? 
[00:51:00]  Well, because he doesn't have, like...  He's just got...  Yeah.  ...the substances now.  He doesn't have the fame.  And the video we just played of him slowly getting into the ring and slurring really badly is on TMZ.  But the fucking assholes, they only gave you a piece because they wanted you to...  Pay for it.  Pay for it.  If he had kept himself clean, he could probably still be wrestling.  Jesus.  Because he's not that old, right?  He's probably in his, like, late 40s to early 50s.  Which you...  But you could still do... 
[00:51:30]  You could still do it at that age in the WWE.  Who's the black guy he's wrestling there?  That's Booker T.  Yeah, that's Booker T.  He was an animal.  Who was the black guy we had in XM who had done time in jail?  MVP.  He was a good guy.  He's no longer with them.  He got released.  He's wrestling in Japan, though.  He's doing well.  He's doing all right?  Yeah.  Because it's...  I don't like this bit.  It's sad.  Wrestling is a...  I mean...  So Larry Sweeney dies and...  Yeah, he hung himself in a wrestling school.  That's kind of sad.  At 29.  And this is Sam doing a promo with the guy. 
[00:52:00]  The video will be up online.  Facebook page.  Three years ago, so...  Hoping Anthony in a little bit.  Probably by the time we come back from vacation.  Hello.  From break.  Yeah, we have young Rich Foss here.  Yeah, but here's the audio of Sam.  To those of you who don't know who I am, I'm primetime Sam Roberts from XM 202.  A producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  A host of the...  We didn't need the plug there.  A what?  A producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm dragging us into this crap.  Why did...  More...  Less to plug you and more to inflate myself. 
[00:52:30]  To be honest.  A fan and Sam show and a graduate of New Rochelle High School.  And I am honored to have been asked to come this April 5th to the New Rochelle High School,  to the New York State Wrestling Federation, and call the Boxer vs. Wrestler match.  Larry Sweet & Sour Sweetie vs. Larry Barnes.  Fans, I'm going to call this just the way you want to see it.  Because I know entertainment and I know what you want.  I'm going to call it right down the middle.  Ah!  Oh, primetime, huh? 
[00:53:00]  Big Sam, huh?  Yeah.  Larry Sweetie, pleased to meet you.  How you doing?  Good.  So, tell me something.  You're going to be the judge, huh?  Yeah.  The judge is this wrestler vs. boxer match.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, all right, great.  Well, listen, man, I think we've got a lot to talk about.  I mean, I'm a big fan of yours.  I'm a big fan of your show.  Thank you.  I mean, really, a long time, long time.  I mean, ever since you've been around.  Big fan of your show.  Well, I was also on it.  I don't think he ever heard us.  He was a heel, so I think he may have been trying to grease the palms of a certain judge. 
[00:53:30]  After hearing part of this, now I understand why he killed himself.  Why would you say that?  He was kind of bummed out he had to do this.  He never got over this, Sam.  I think he just killed a wrestler.  He was fine with this.  He got a lot of promotion out of it.  He was on O&A.  Long time, long time.  I mean, ever since you've been around.  I've been following your career.  And it's an honor for me to meet you.  And, you know, there are a couple things that I'd like to talk about in private.  Here, I've got a card.  Why don't I give you a card? 
[00:54:00]  And have your people call my people, all right?  I'll do that.  All right.  That's great.  Good to meet you.  Thanks.  Who are your people?  Why don't I...  Who would this guy call?  I guess call your people.  There you go.  End of bit.  Well, that guy's dead.  Yes.  It's kind of creepy.  It's really creepy.  Just because he's young.  29.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  And one year ago, everybody was talking about how much potential he had. 
[00:54:30]  Like, everybody was talking about him on the indie scene.  Yeah, and I...  Why do he have to fucking hang himself at a wrestling school?  That's creepy.  I had to do it there.  I don't know.  And that's...  But he had...  When I was talking to him, like...  That's selfish, too, man.  Because then someone that loves you has to cut you down.  What the fuck?  Or some fucking maintenance guy at the wrestling school.  Exactly.  You think?  Yeah.  The guy who runs the school probably went through his pockets before he cut him down.  I always wonder who has to cut you down.  Behind yourself. 
[00:55:00]  You know who's selfish was Madoff's son?  Because he hung himself with his fucking baby sleeping in the next room, and he sent, like,  an email to his wife who was away.  What a piece of shit.  With a baby...  Like, what if the kid started coughing and needed to be rolled over or whatever?  Something.  Piece of shit.  Yeah.  Very...  Hang yourself, but don't do it when your kid is there alone with you.  The kid is, like, fucking two.  Yeah.  Call someone to go, hey, can you take my kid to the park?  Yeah.  I got a call.  I got a name.  I hang myself real quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or do it that way, too.  Sure. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  We're going to break.  We got Rich Voss outside the studio, and E-Rock found Tippi Tom's rock poo.  I'm telling you, it's a rock.  Rock poo.  You're going to hear the sound.  You're going to hear the sound for yourself, because some people are saying it was sort  of clay-ish and stuff.  No, this was a rock.  It looked like baked clay.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Do you agree with me that if you threw it at this window, the window would at least  crack?  If there was a piece with enough mass, yeah, you could definitely break a window. 
[00:56:00]  Okay.  It felt like a rock.  It looked like clay, but the bottom line is it was feces.  It was doo-doo.  Okay.  We're going to play the clip next.  It's crap.  It's one minute.  We'll get Voss in here.  We're going to play Tippi Tom's rock poo.  And...  I don't know.  That's so funny.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  We'll figure out some other shit.  I think it's because if you just turned in, you're like,  what the fuck?  Yeah.  Tippi Tom's rock poo?  We haven't talked about his rock poo in a while.  It has to come up.  It sounds very...  It's a strange sentence out of context.  Rock poo.  Rock poo. 
[00:56:30]  We miss Tippi Tom.  He was probably the greatest side fucking character ever.  ONA freak, you mean?  I miss him incredibly.  Or whatever you want to call it.  What did Voss call him?  ONA freaks.  Like Bob Kelly and Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom was the number one fucking ONA freak.  He's the original Golden Buns.  Sorry to those other guys who I forgot.  Talking about Twitchels?  Twitchels, yeah.  Louis Twitchels Santani.  He was a weird one, man.  He was a strange fuck.  Yes, he is. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  We're babbling.  We'll see you in a bit.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Uh, marriage is...  Hey, Rich, no one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all  the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no. 
[00:57:30]  Is he bad with, like, casually loving touching?  Well, because I know he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't, like,  hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile  ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie, and rest a little 
[00:58:00]  easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted.  And then he gets mad!  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  Not a whole thing.  It's the virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com. 
[00:58:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sad but true.  11 years ago today, Metallica sues Napster.  Nice tie-in there, Yurok.  Voss is here.  Jimmy's here.  They're outside doing something else.  That's fine.  Waw, waw, waw, waw.  Waw, waw, waw. 
[00:59:00]  Had a good day making videos yesterday, Sam.  I saw them.  I made a video of Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K. in the elevator.  The Ricky Gervais interview will be Friday.  We pre-taped it sometime on Friday during the show.  You'll hear that.  But on the way out, I made a quick little video in the elevator, and it's doing really well.  It made the front page of Reddit, which is pretty damn cool.  I just wish you had filmed from the beginning.  I know, man, because we ran into Daryl Hall, John Oates, and Louis C.K. basically said, 
[00:59:30]  I love your music.  It was a fanboy moment.  It's very awkward.  So then Ricky Gervais just beat the shit out of Louis C.K. in the elevator, and I got a  little piece of that, and the video's doing real well.  That's on my Twitter, OP Radio.  I'll just promote myself until these fucking guys come back in here.  You should.  And then I'm going to bring it to the show in a few minutes with these guys.  I was walking the streets with Roland yesterday, and I ran into a real-life monster. 
[01:00:00]  This one gave me a chuckle last night.  I was sitting, I clicked, I laughed.  It did.  I laughed out loud at the end.  I wasn't expecting it.  It seems that the video's doing pretty well.  Yeah, I ran into a monster.  That's on my Twitter, OP Radio.  Look for my biggest fan as the title.  And then there was another video with Roland.  Roland found a wedding ring yesterday.  Oh.  And I filmed that as well.  I didn't even know you were looking, Roland.  Hey, Rich Voss.  How are you, sir?  How's it going? 
[01:00:30]  Why the energy?  Huh?  Why the energy?  Is this the new Rich Voss?  I've been loaded with Nicaragum this morning, and I just watched 14 minutes of our movie,  and you know what?  In 14 minutes, watching Kenny laugh like four or five times is a really good sign.  Oh, no.  Your movie is going to do well.  It's fucking, oh, God.  Your movie on whether women are funny or not is almost done, right?  Well, the editing's almost done.  Then we got to do the fucking music and sound and all that shit. 
[01:01:00]  It's a fucking nightmare.  And then we got to do color coordination, which won't be hard.  And just, I don't know.  We interviewed Joan Rivers for an hour.  Wow.  Fucking Joan Rivers.  Roger O'Donnell's doing the same concept movie.  It comes out.  What's that?  About women are funny.  I try back that next week.  Oh, really?  You don't even get a call back for that, okay?  Because you were so unbelievable.  You didn't like his acting there?  No.  But I have a founding new respect for Roland. 
[01:01:30]  Why?  Because a fucking guy comes here and he's here for like 14 hours a fucking day for this  hogwash four-hour radio show.  And he's got to do so much fucking work for this bullshit.  You know what?  Oh, I got to be here all day to get Jay Moore in.  How fucking hard is that?  You just ask him.  He'll do anything.  Jay's on his way.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's in the other place.  He's doing Imus.  Yeah, I heard on the radio come in.  Oh, you heard him on Imus?  No, I heard that he's coming in on Imus.  Yeah, he's doing Imus and then because Imus is across the street, he said, what the hell?  I'm coming in.  We've had a good run with Jay Moore, so we might as well squeeze that a little more. 
[01:02:00]  But Roland...  He gets here extremely early for no apparent...  Roland?  I mean, yeah.  No, because he likes hanging out when the show's on.  The problem is SiriusXM forces him to do a nine-hour day.  It's ridiculous.  When he could do his job from home.  Like, these corporate guys have got to start thinking differently.  They're sick of hearing it out there, so I'll shut up.  But you don't need a booker here nine hours just so you feel good that you justify his pay or something.  I don't know.  I have nothing against corporate until I get my locations released from this company. 
[01:02:30]  But I think corporate does know what they're doing or else they wouldn't be corporate.  Right.  And I'm on their side most of the time.  Good luck with that, by the way.  They're going to want something.  You know what they're going to get?  A lot of publicity.  They're going to want something.  There's nothing to give.  That's what they're about.  No, they're going to get a lot of publicity.  And there's nothing bad.  There's no bad light on Opie and Anthony or on Sirius.  It's only going to make them look good.  I think we're going to say it's a funny radio show.  I told you what to do with that, and now you're bringing to everyone's attention you're not smart. 
[01:03:00]  I didn't bring to anybody's attention.  Who do you think is listening to this?  Let's just shut up.  That was the first thing I hear when I walk back in the studio is, oh, because of Rich, you're not smart.  Really?  That was the first thing?  And I love Rich, and I told him what to do.  So just.  All right.  All right.  I love Rich, too.  What have you been up to?  Everything else good?  Yeah, let's see.  What else is good?  We were talking Masters, but no one wants to hear that on the radio, I don't think.  I heard Tiger did well, but he didn't.  See, here's the problem. 
[01:03:30]  Here's the problem.  Jimmy was just touching Rich, and of course you jumped back.  In fact, and this is like the whole country, and we discussed this before, the first thing he brought up was Tiger.  Tiger.  And no one gives a fuck anymore about Tiger.  That's not true.  It is true.  Rich, why are you doing that to yourself?  They didn't care until the Masters, but all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he had an amazing run,  and he came in fourth place.  Okay, he came in fourth place.  He was that close.  But you know what?  And if he didn't miss a couple of putts, he was right there.  Oh, and it's same with a million. 
[01:04:00]  Who won the Masters?  Of course, Schwartz and Niggal or something.  Exactly.  Nobody knows who he is.  But here's the thing about Tiger.  His name's Charles.  Here's the thing about.  C-H-A-R-L.  No one knows him.  Schwartz.  Here's the thing about Tiger.  It's so much like water cooler talk about.  You know, just because it's water cooler talk.  It's not like those people are running to watch golf.  They just talk about him.  Yeah, I know.  It's like, no, it's the same as when Tanya Harding fucking broke Nancy Kerrigan's knee  Kerrigan.  No one ran and watched figure skating. 
[01:04:30]  Rich, what you're saying was absolutely correct until this past weekend.  Oh, yeah.  But that's why everyone went, holy shit, because wait a minute.  I even said, I'm like, this guy's done.  He'll never win another.  He might win another major, but his run is pretty much over, you know, dominating the sport.  And then the Masters hits, and this guy fucking had an amazing run.  Yeah, he had an amazing run.  So for once, people should be talking about him in his golf game.  Leading up to this, it was like, why are you even showing Tiger?  He's in 28th place. 
[01:05:00]  You know what I mean?  Here's the thing.  You say he had an amazing run, which he did, but so did 10 other guys.  Right, but no one cares about that.  Okay, he's 10 under.  Rich.  Okay.  No one cares about those guys.  Rich.  Yeah, but they do.  They really do.  Golf fans do.  I'm telling you, I don't watch golf.  I know that, but golf, they want more than golf.  Tiger doesn't make the money he makes in endorsements only for golf fans.  Right.  It's because he's bigger than golf.  Yeah.  And that's why people care that he came in fourth.  He's the only one in that whole sport that I care about.  The sport bores me. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, but you don't watch the sport, so you don't care about the sport.  You care about him.  Of course, the point I'm making, that's the majority of people, and I'm not saying golf  isn't a major sport, but it's not like fucking baseball.  They don't have many fucking giant stars outside their world.  Derek Jeter's a huge star throughout the sports world.  Fucking, Peyton Manning is a big fucking sports star.  Tiger is a big star.  Here's the thing.  You really probably didn't give a fuck about Tiger until his infidelity.  That's not true. 
[01:06:00]  How many times did you talk about Tiger before that?  It's one of the shows I did with Dice years ago, so I've been a Tiger fan for many, many  years I've been a Tiger fan.  I'm kind of confused by you.  This doesn't make sense, because everyone was talking about Tiger's run.  He shot, what, 31?  He shot great.  It was great watching.  What did he shoot on the front nine?  31?  He shot a four or five on the front.  No, six on the front.  So that would be a 31 or a 30.  That's a run.  He was on a run, and he was right in the hunt. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know what point, and he was technically the leader when he, listen to me, he was technically  the leader at the end of his final round at the Masters.  There was every reason to show him on Sunday.  Yes.  I didn't say you should have shown him.  But when the next tournament he plays in, if he's doing shitty again and he's in 28th  place, then everything you're saying makes complete sense.  He's just maddening.  Two rounds ago.  It's frustrating.  Two rounds ago, two tournaments ago, he played, I guess it was, whatever the tournament, they're 
[01:07:00]  following him.  Yeah, I agree with you on that point.  And he's fucking...  I agree with you.  Okay, and I think he's...  Don't show as many Tiger shots and show some of these young guys that are going to be really,  really impressive in the coming years.  If you're watching this fucking kid, you know, this Ricky Barnes or Dustin Johnson or these  fucking guys...  Ricky Barnes is a bad example.  The only thing that can kill Ricky Barnes is Ricky Barnes.  No one gives a shit about Ricky Barnes.  And you just fucked up your own point.  He's fun to watch.  Well, some people would say Tiger's still fun to watch because he's so pissed off and  I believe he is fun to watch.  Ricky Barnes is sort of a middle-of-the-pack guy right now. 
[01:07:30]  You know that.  Did I say Ricky Barnes?  I meant Ricky Fowler.  Did it Ricky Fowler?  I meant Fowler.  All right.  Orange guy.  Yeah, I like...  He's fun.  There's certain guys.  Ian Poulter's fun to watch.  Ian Poulter is a middle-of-the-pack guy.  Yes, but he's fun to watch.  So Tiger's fun to watch for a lot of people.  I know that.  I agree 100% with that.  You should have said McElroy.  You should have said Dustin Johnson.  None of those guys that we know of have...  Tiger, in people's minds, still has the potential to be the greatest of all time as far as...  He still has a lot of years of playing left. 
[01:08:00]  And it's like what...  I mean, this is a bad example, but Mike Tyson, for a long time after Tyson's prime, he fascinated  people because you always felt with him, like, the absolute greatness that he threw...  Like, you knew you were watching one who could have been one of the greatest of all time.  How frustrating is that when these guys throw their talent away like that?  And that fucking rape conviction...  Killed them.  It really did.  And Tiger, man, you know, if he...  I don't know.  If he never got that nine iron across the face...  I know.  ...if that happened. 
[01:08:30]  No, I love watching him.  I just...  Hold on.  Why are you opening your iPad?  I'm trying to look something up on my iPad.  What are you trying to look up?  Where did you get that?  Huh?  Ebay?  You didn't go to the Apple store.  Where did you get your iPad?  What do you mean when I get my iPad?  Where...  Did you finally treat yourself like we've been telling you for years?  Or did you find it online?  I bought it from Bobby.  Of course he did.  Well, don't you buy anything new, Rich?  Because here's the reason.  Did he give you a good deal? 
[01:09:00]  $500.  God, I would love to know what's...  $500?  Well, because this is the biggest of...  It has the most...  I understand.  Memory.  I know what it is.  That fucker made you pay $500 for that?  He paid $800 for it.  Danny, why don't you tell him how much you get an iPad online?  He paid $800 for this.  Well, I got mine for like $250.  Do you?  I get what you want to buy another one?  With this many...  I don't need that many.  Your own friend ripped you off.  Well, I do because I put a lot of movies on it.  What are you searching for, Rich?  Nothing.  I just want to show you guys I finally got an iPad.  It's like show and tell.  It's a nice fucking... 
[01:09:30]  Is that Bob's case?  I don't even have any reason...  Yeah, I had to change the name on it.  Rich, you have a really good career.  Well, really?  What are we...  Three years ago?  But walk into the Apple store and get the new iPad, too.  Here's the reason I'm going to, but here's the reason I bought this.  What?  I don't want to get a new one yet.  I wanted to get this to practice on and learn it and...  What, are you going to drive your new one into a wall?  You don't have to practice on it.  What do you need practice with?  Huh?  Touching things.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  A little stiff.  I got to put this through a hole in my hand. 
[01:10:00]  It's kind of nice, though.  Do you have AT&T on it?  No.  No, I just had the Wi-Fi.  Because it's too...  Who needs AT&T on it?  Everyone, because you're not going to get service in a lot of places.  I get it everywhere I go.  I won't do a gig unless I have free Wi-Fi.  Yes, you will.  First of all, yes, you will.  Is that your new thing?  That's my stipulation.  You'll do a gig if there's no mic.  I fucking love Voss.  We just want to hold you.  Don't you want to just hold them?  I am playing the best golf courses. 
[01:10:30]  I just got back from San Francisco area.  I played the San Francisco Golf Club and the Cal Club.  I don't know what that means.  People out there would know.  No, but we don't know.  What's that mean?  Good places.  What's it mean?  They have the room where you drink and eat and stuff.  Women aren't allowed in it.  That's a great place.  Why would you want to hang out with women?  You're so right.  You're so right.  Why have women around?  If you know women aren't allowed in it, you know who else isn't allowed in it.  You know what I'm saying?  That's true. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, women are icky, right?  It was great, man.  That's why a part of me hates the fact that they don't have women, though, because women do fuck up your fun.  And these guys like to get hookers and stuff, and the broads are just ruined it.  I got to agree with Richard.  I mean, nothing worse than being behind a foursome of broads.  Oh, broads.  Or Japanese.  Where they're 100 yards out, and they're pulling out a, will this make sense to anyone?  A five-wood.  I played with two ladies yesterday, and they were older, but they were so hot. 
[01:11:30]  They had such nice tits and asses.  I couldn't concert.  Like, the front nine I played by myself, and I shot, like, 42.  And then the back nine, I couldn't stop staring at this late, their tits and their asses as they were bending over the putt.  I almost started jerking off on the fucking green.  I was so fucking, I'm just thinking of these old ladies how fucking dry their fucking snatches are, but how fucking fun it would be if I could get in.  You know, oh, God.  How old were you?  I mean, how old were they?  Excuse me, sorry.  I don't know.  Probably 55, 56. 
[01:12:00]  Ew.  So they're your age.  Huh?  They're your age.  A little older, but the one was probably in her 40s.  But their just, tits were so perfect.  And I don't even give a fuck about tits.  What a waste of time they are.  Tits are fucking, who cares about tits?  How old do you play golfers?  Three, four times.  A lot.  I mean, I play a lot.  It's his thing.  Three, four times a week?  Yeah.  What time do you wake up to play?  It depends.  Sometimes five, sometimes six.  Sometimes five, seven.  It depends. 
[01:12:30]  You get up that early every day just because you want to get up?  It's great to be on a golf course.  I want to get the fuck out of the house before she gets up.  But it's fun.  It depends.  You don't mind the road.  Do you like it early tea time or no?  Yeah, because I get to play quick.  And I don't want to be stuck behind every fucking horrible golfer on the planet.  You play with strangers usually?  Yeah.  It's the fucking worst on the road, Locust.  In Leicester, when I was in here last time, this guy called.  And he got me on a course that was unbelievable.  I mean, I played in Atlanta, TPC, Sugarloaf.  I play the best courses in the country because I go on radio. 
[01:13:00]  I call the course.  I go, look, I'll be on radio tomorrow.  I'll plug you guys.  Right?  And I fucking get on the best courses.  And I wear my golf.  That's how I get free golf clothes because I'll wear them into the studio and they'll start  talking about the pants.  So I plug in them.  This is plugola.  You could go to jail for this.  No, I can't.  I can't.  I'm not hot.  I'm not fucking.  That's true.  He's not paid.  I'm not paid.  You're lucky.  So on the road, what else am I going to do all day?  So I go play golf.  You know, I fucking sit in the hotel. 
[01:13:30]  I chip balls into the curtain.  What's that night?  I chip balls.  Sorry.  I hit balls into the curtain in the hotel room.  Sometimes I miss and you hear bangs on the wall.  Do you really?  Yeah, I'm bored.  What am I going to do on the fucking road?  A lot of people write jokes.  I write on stage.  I can't, you know, unless I'm doing one of those.  Can't you be writing while you're playing golf all of a sudden to think of something  and go, oh, and then write it down?  Why not?  Sometimes.  I mean, you know, I'm not like that as a comment.  If I come up with a huge job page.  So do you have to sit there in a room with a piece of paper and a pen and just wait for 
[01:14:00]  the jokes to come?  No, I never do.  I couldn't.  When you do a show like Red Eye or Joey Behar or Tough Crowd, that's when it's funny because  they give you the topics and you write about them.  That's when it's fun.  Right.  You know, but I'm playing golf with guys and you can't tell them you're a comic.  They fucking, it's the worst.  So I usually tell them.  They start telling you jokes?  Oh, it's fucking horrible.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One guy told me a good joke last week.  He goes, this guy comes home and says to his wife, tell me something that's going to  make me happy and mad.  And she goes, well, you got a bigger dick than your brothers. 
[01:14:30]  That was the joke.  It wasn't bad.  But I tell them I'm an FBI profiler and I get more questions and I just lie my way through  the fucking round.  Do you, I'm sad for Rich.  Why?  You're living the fan.  You want to see what it's like to be, to be like that guy.  What are you doing?  Well, I don't want to tell him I'm a comic.  I'm an FBI profiler.  What am I going to say?  I'm a house painter?  That's boring. 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  That's the point.  You don't want to talk to him.  You don't tell him you have a fascinating job.  Yeah, because then you're going to be caught up in lies.  I'm an astronaut.  Right.  I was on the last space shuttle mission.  You always come up with, I always say marketing, because who the fuck wants to talk about marketing?  Right.  Why?  You could say Opie and Anthony.  I don't feel like talking about Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I fucking too well with it.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Touche.  Fucking touche.  And I'm fucking going to explain why.  What an idiot.  Good job. 
[01:15:30]  I've said advertising before.  You do, right?  Because I don't want to fuck.  No one bullies you.  As soon as you say marketing, they don't go, oh, really?  Could you tell me for who?  They don't give a fuck at that point.  Yeah, but I like fucking lying to them all day about the profiler.  But you're an FBI profiler.  Yeah.  And what do they say?  They probably wonder, like, how could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad.  How could he be a profiler?  Jesus Christ.  Well, they're not the brainiacs on the book.  Obviously, you're not.  So what kind of questions did they ask you?  I told them I worked on the, what do you call it, Seattle, the Green River. 
[01:16:00]  What was it called?  I worked on that.  I told them I worked on the Green River.  Wait a minute.  You say the Green River.  I don't even know who the guy is that you worked on.  He even goes for high-profile cases.  Yeah, I told them I worked on the Green Apple Killer.  I told them I worked on the Atlanta Child Killers.  That was 81.  Oh, yeah.  You're all of it.  You're fucked up.  You are fucked up.  You're fucked up.  You might have multiple personalities or something. 
[01:16:30]  He doesn't even have one.  That's too twisted.  You're a liar.  That's too twisted.  You're an FBI profiler and you're working on high-profile cases.  That's fucking weird, dude.  I don't do it all the time.  Sometimes I say fuck that.  The fact that you've done it once.  Do you get caught up in your lies, though?  Because you don't have enough info on the Green River Killer.  I give them enough where I say I can't talk anymore.  Is it the Green River Killer, Jimmy?  Yeah.  What do you know on that?  It was in Seattle.  Let's make believe you're talking to us.  Wow, you're an FBI profiler.  And, you know, when we were profiling from the remains, well, then I go, look, I can't 
[01:17:00]  talk a lot about it, but it was very...  Even though books weren't written about it, why can't you?  It was really intense.  What?  We had to profile for the evidence?  It was really intense?  What an idiot who offers nothing?  Are you losing your mind?  Yes.  You are, right?  You're losing a little bit, huh?  I'm an FBI profiler.  The Green River, whatever it was.  He never disappoints, this fucking guy. 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  Whatever.  No, I want to hear more about that.  What does your job entail?  Well, they asked me where I work out of.  One guy said, where do you work out of?  I go in Newark.  I work out of the federal building in Newark.  And I knew it was in Newark.  He goes, well, I go on Division Street, I guess.  So, obviously, I was right.  It was in that area.  What's in Newark?  We were doing mainly a lot on, you know, terrorists and terrorist-type threats and stuff  like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murders and just, you know, when we worked 
[01:18:00]  on the Atlanta case.  What was the guy's name?  Who was the child killer in Atlanta?  Child killer?  Some black dude.  What was his name, though?  Well, this is a question that someone could ask.  Oh, oh, oh, Kyle Grooms.  No, and the FBI were the ones who actually, the police thought in Atlanta that it was a  black, that it was white supremacist and Klan who were doing it. 
[01:18:30]  How did you guys know that it was a black killer?  Well, this is how we knew it.  We, the killer would call.  We would talk to the killer and the killer said there was a body on-  Say the killer again.  The killer said there was a body on Martin Luther King Boulevard or whatever.  So, we went there and we had, obviously, lookouts and we went to dig up the-  Lookouts.  We had lookouts.  We had, you know, FBI.  We had a lot of G-men.  And we were digging up the road. 
[01:19:00]  We dug up the side of the road.  And we dug up the-  We dug up the wrong-  Hold on.  You don't do this.  We dug up the wrong side of the road on purpose.  No, stop him for a second.  You don't do this.  What do you mean?  I'm getting really uncomfortable.  I don't do this.  You don't do this.  I don't get this much in detail.  You brought this bit to the show today.  I appreciate it.  You're actually an FBI profiler on the road.  Sometime.  Oh, my God.  I didn't say it was a good one.  I'm so uncomfortable.  But you're terrible.  Do people just walk away from you? 
[01:19:30]  Well, when I bite my arm.  Do you bite your arm when you miss?  Yeah.  When it happens to me?  He bites his arm when he misses in front of other people.  What the fuck?  Wait.  Have you ever bitten your arm after telling someone you're a profiler? 
[01:20:00]  This guy's an asshole.  Who does he catch?  I'm fucking drooling.  What a fucking jerk.  You're like six.  Wait.  So you'll actually...  You've bitten your arm angrily?  Where do you bite it?  Right here?  Here.  If you ever get frustrated or mad, just fucking bite it until it hurts.  It takes away all the frustration.  So you bite it, and what do they do?  They don't want to ask about the profiling shit anymore. 
[01:20:30]  I fucking bite.  I used to.  Between my bicep and my shoulder was my spot.  I go like this and bite really hard.  When you're frustrated?  Yeah, I don't do it anymore.  I don't know why.  I guess I'm more chill.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  You can't get your arm to your mouth.  Remember James Caan?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Like that.  So in the middle of telling them you're an FBI profiler, you bite your arm real...  It depends how bad the shot is.  And then they don't want to talk to you anymore.  The green guy, river guy. 
[01:21:00]  You don't even know the Atlanta child killer.  He's one of the most famous serial killers ever.  What was his name again?  Wayne Williams.  Oh, Wayne, yeah.  Oh, Wayne, of course.  So why wouldn't you Google some of this before you tell all your lies?  Yeah.  So you're up on your info.  How did they get him to explode on the stand?  What happened?  They brought up his mom and his childhood.  They brought up his childhood.  And how did it... 
[01:21:30]  But I was right about how they dug up the wrong side of the road.  You were, but just the way you said it was the way...  Lookouts.  They had lookouts.  We have lookouts, FBI, profile...  Road.  They just keep saying profile, profilers.  Other profilers, profilers.  I don't do it all the time.  The fact that you've ever even thought about doing it once is humiliating.  Yeah, if you do it once, it's too many times.  Well, you never lied.  You say you're in marketing.  But that's where it ends.  But you want to keep talking.  Yeah, because I know they'll never ask a follow-up question.  What if they do?  I swear to you, I don't think they ever have. 
[01:22:00]  Because no one that they see, unfortunately, because when you're...  You have to write where you work, because you can't fuck up paperwork.  So I write SiriusX, and they're like, oh, what do you do for them?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Ah, marketing.  And I say it like that.  Ah, marketing.  It ends the conversation.  They don't want to hear about marketing.  They want to hear about some of these radio shows.  Not a marketing guy.  And then you don't have to talk to them about that crap.  Then you can talk to them about whatever you want to talk to them about.  Well, fucking yesterday, I played in some... 
[01:22:30]  Like, I played a front by myself and a back, and I joined the two ladies.  And this guy, he knew I was a comic.  Hey, where you working?  Ah, fucking leave me alone.  Then two holes later, hey, ladies, did he tell you what he does?  And it's just so fucking aggro.  Like, I'm already known as a cranky guy around town.  Like...  Did he just say that?  Did he just say he's known as a cranky guy around town?  Are you really?  What town?  Where I live, in Hillsborough. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, your actual town.  I thought you meant just on the road.  No.  The word gets out quickly.  Oh, he's the cranky guy around town.  Yeah, I'm a cranky guy.  So why are you known as a cranky guy around town?  I guess I fucking don't have...  Like, I was in Walmart yesterday, and I bought Nickrat gum, and a lady said, do you have ID?  I go, are you fucking for real?  Well, we have to.  I go, look at me.  Obviously, I'm over 18 or 21.  That is ridiculous.  But I would consider that a compliment.  No, it's not.  They do it because they're so brainwashed and so...  You're kind of right.  They're robotic. 
[01:23:30]  No one thinks outside the box.  No one's scared to make an executive decision, which that isn't a big one.  But no one, a $7 Walmart cashier is not going to make an executive decision about their job.  You know?  Yes, okay.  To sell you nicotine.  Yeah, she just wants to make sure she doesn't get fired for doing the wrong thing.  Jesus Christ, the entertainers are talking.  Listen to me.  When?  Okay?  I'll walk rubbing your glue.  Shut up.  Here's what I'm saying.  Cranky guy around town.  He's the cranky guy on the show. 
[01:24:00]  There's some things in life.  He's the cranky guy around town.  Like they're at Starbucks.  Oh, fuck.  I was fucking...  Here comes his fucking ferret face.  I was in Dunkin' Donuts the other fucking day.  Dunkin' Donuts?  Dunkin' Donuts.  And fucking I order a tuna sandwich.  In Dunkin' Donuts?  It might have been egg or whatever.  It could have been egg.  They're in a shrimp stampy.  It might have been egg.  They have good tuna there.  They have good tuna.  Look, anyhow, the girl called.  Look, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[01:24:30]  Like, please, we can't let these fucking things just pass us by.  You would remember if you ordered a tuna fish sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts.  Yeah, but I definitely had one the other day.  Why would you go there for tuna fish?  I'm sorry.  It wasn't a planned, hey, I got up in the morning and go, I'm going to get tuna today.  Where am I going to go?  As I was driving down the street, I was fucking hungry.  I didn't want an egg sandwich.  I was in a rush.  I got a tuna sandwich.  It wasn't premeditated, okay?  Right, so good term for your fucking, your next golf chat. 
[01:25:00]  What, premeditated?  Premeditated.  Yeah, stop spitting on the mic.  It's a piece of food on the mic.  Is that part of your tuna fish sandwich?  So the fucking girl coughed, and I made her make me another one.  That's, you know what?  Yeah, she coughed.  I don't give a fuck.  Clean your hand, Rich.  Jesus.  Wait, what?  The front finger.  Oh, are you picking your teeth?  He's picking his teeth.  All right, cranky guy around town.  That little piece of egg bothered you. 
[01:25:30]  Fucking jizz splashes off your face.  I'm not saying life isn't without inconsistencies.  But when it's someone else's food like that, yes, of course it does.  A little teeny brain was in that tissue.  Rich, you're just degraded.  So, you know, I'm a cranky guy.  My wife won't get, like, you know, like we go into fucking places.  And, like, the girl at the sub place got mad because I made her wash her hands before she made my sub. 
[01:26:00]  I said, go wash your hands.  You're kind of a germ freak.  No, it's not germs.  It's just, you know.  That's germs.  No, it's not the germs.  Then why would you want her to wash her hands?  For political reasons?  Yeah, it's the germs.  For apartheid?  Well, you know what I mean.  It's basically the germs, but it's just, it's what you're supposed to do.  Like, when you're on stage, you're supposed to have a great show, which you do.  That's what you're supposed to do at work.  What I'm supposed to do at work, I do.  Sure, just catch the bad guys.  But if you don't care about...  So fucking... 
[01:26:30]  FBI profiling.  Yeah, but if you don't care about germs, who gives a fuck if she washes her hands?  I do care about germs.  Don't get me wrong.  Do they put the plastic gloves on?  I make them.  The fancy places do.  I make them.  Putting a fucking finger in my cup when they pull it out.  Nope, new cup.  Oh, new cup for the cranky guy.  New cup.  The cranky.  Does Bonnie ever get embarrassed?  Yes.  She's like so fucking Canadian and passive and...  Has she had it with you?  Yeah.  She had it with me when the Oscar gift basket ran out. 
[01:27:00]  When we fucking...  Like, when they ask for ID for a Nickerette and I yell and I won't do it, she goes,  just give it to him.  I go, no.  You're both right.  She's right.  Just give it to him, but it is annoying.  First of all, you don't want people looking at your dresses on your license, you know,  or knowing exactly, you know.  Sure.  I mean, obviously, who is the guy that you would use that to get as victims?  FBI profiler.  Man, I know the road is boring for you guys, but he's making up a double life for himself. 
[01:27:30]  Why don't you just say successful comic?  I can't lie like that good.  So, okay, so where else are you cranky?  This is just making me very happy.  Just every fucking where.  Just, I don't have patience anymore for these fucking people.  Where did, uh...  Tollboot the other day, I pull up and they're on the phone.  I go, can you wrap it up and take my money? 
[01:28:00]  Can you fucking wrap it up?  Wait, why do you need them?  Why don't you have easy pass?  And why don't you have easy pass?  Do you still not have easy pass?  Yeah, but I'm looking into it.  What a fucking idiot!  Look, I was really late to the easy pass party.  I know.  And I've had it probably four years now.  You're still fucking paying cash and getting a receipt?  I don't get a receipt.  With all the driving you do, what's wrong with you?  Why do you need a receipt?  Why are you looking at me like you're acting somewhere?  Why do you need a receipt?  Your eyes popped up.  I thought you were doing a scene.  Why do you need the woman off the phone? 
[01:28:30]  I don't need any interaction with them.  Here's my fucking money.  Why do you need a receipt to write it off?  First of all, I've been audited twice.  All you need is to log.  When they come and audit you, they don't go through your receipts with a little thing  in a fucking visor.  If you have records that show...  Why do you not have easy pass?  Okay, let's get back to the receipt.  No, no.  Why do you have Bob Kelly's iPad?  What's that?  What's the matter?  You think they're going to take your money from your credit card? 
[01:29:00]  No.  What are you scared of?  Yeah, what's wrong with the easy pass?  You know what?  I'm going to fill it out.  I'm really going to do it.  No, no, no.  You're overwhelmed by...  Rich is overwhelmed because he's a little teeny...  There's something about it.  It's just overwhelming to you.  There's a lot of...  You're opening up today.  What is the real issue?  No, no.  But what is it about easy pass?  What is it?  I've had it for 10 years.  Just speak your mind right now.  Go.  Don't hold back.  No filter.  There's a lot of...  It's paperwork.  Tired of paperwork.  I'm not a good paperwork guy.  I'm going to fill it out.  But still.  The hours of...  Fucking you sat...  Do you know how many hours of your life have been spent in traffic? 
[01:29:30]  It's ridiculous.  I mean, you're going to hit it with easy pass, but it's sometimes one-tenth of the traffic.  Yeah.  I'm going to do it.  Guys like you are the problem.  You're the reason.  It's like as much as you're in New York, as much as you drive, and you hate all these fucking  bad drives.  You're the reason there's traffic.  Guys like you.  No.  Yes.  I don't stop.  People like you are the reason that there's traffic.  God damn it.  The FBI profiler just loses. 
[01:30:00]  I don't fucking...  I got a lot of mucus.  Dude, guys like you are the problem.  You're the reason there's traffic.  The people are the problem.  The people are the problem.  The people are the slow down.  You.  You have to slow down and pay.  You have to slow down and pay.  You're fucking tall.  Oh, it's different lanes.  No, no.  Exactly.  You blocked easy pass lanes.  Because not enough people have easy pass lanes.  Yeah, I'm going to get it.  I agree with you on this one.  So they're in the easy pass lanes to move over to pay their cash.  It should be one fucking...  Every lane should be easy pass.  This is because of the unions.  They have these fucking toll collectors.  One non-easy pass lane.  Well, you can't be for or against unions.  You can't be for unions for TV and then against unions for this. 
[01:30:30]  You've got to be, you know...  I'm not against unions for this.  I'm not against unions.  When unions become the...  When the priority is taking care of union people and not the public good, I'm against that  part of the union.  And the fucking easy pass should be every lane except for one.  If you don't have easy pass, you should sit for an hour and 45 minutes while people who  have it fly through.  What made you come to that determination?  Because an hour and 50 minutes is too harsh.  An hour and 40 minutes just isn't harsh enough. 
[01:31:00]  It is a great luxury to have, Rich.  And you do a lot of driving around the area to do jokes.  It's ridiculous.  What's one of the most common crossings that you encounter?  My sexuality.  He's on today.  The FBI profiler should be a kind of...  What do you mean?  Like a toll that you pay all the time.  I guess it would have to be the Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah, the Lincoln.  Shit.  Do you know how long you have to wait at the Lincoln Tunnel?  And you're paying more money by paying cash.  It's just...  You're right.  I got to agree with you on this one. 
[01:31:30]  You know how much money you can be saving?  Years ago, you should have done this.  Yeah, I know.  And Bonnie tolerates this?  She lays in bed with me.  You think that's the biggest worry?  Jimmy, as they slow down to get in line to pay the cash.  That's a ton of cash you're saving.  $4.80?  It doesn't cost $6.50 to go.  It costs $8.  Maybe this is all.  That's all.  It costs $8.  You're paying a lot more than you have to.  Yeah, I know.  And you're just handing over your cash to these guys in the line.  You've got to wait for people to get changed in front of you.  And they won't even get off the phone for you.  I know.  That's the point.  I love the... 
[01:32:00]  I haven't fucking seen a toll collector.  I love fucking just going through.  And they just take you off your credit card.  They're not going to rip you off.  Who cares?  Listen, I buy shit online and win my credit card all the time.  Yeah, cars.  And you go through and you just go vroom, vroom as you go through easy.  You're overwhelmed by the paperwork.  He doesn't know how to do the process.  He doesn't know where to go.  It becomes overwhelming.  Did you do...  Oh, I've got to talk to you off the air.  I know how you can get a lot of money, pal.  A lot of money.  If it's about Twitter.  No.  A lot of money.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Tell me.  Yeah, let's see.  Well, I don't know if you can because you're on payroll.  There's a company.  I don't know if I...  I'm not going to talk about it.  Tell me off the air.  Are you making a lot of money with this?  No, I made some decent money.  Is this a pyramid scheme?  No.  No.  No.  You made some money?  Yeah.  How much did you make?  Enough to buy Bob Kelly's iPad.  Five grand.  By the way, everyone is saying that fucking Bob Kelly ripped you off.  They probably did.  That thing was $700 a year ago.  And you're a friend. 
[01:33:00]  He should have gave you a couple hundred bucks.  $350.  Call him.  Yeah, something.  He ripped you off.  Call him.  Email him on your iPad.  He was able to get $500 out of you.  I'm not going to nickel and dime him.  I'm not that kind of guy.  And how many times...  Yes, you are that kind of guy.  Well, I like a deal, but what the fuck?  Call him.  Say, why would you rip off his boss?  You fucking...  There's 15 minutes to kill.  I don't need to kill time.  No, I do.  Why do you need to?  You've done a great 40 minutes so far.  Oh.  We're off to a great start.  I want to know why you're so hyper today. 
[01:33:30]  I'm not hyper.  I just, you know...  I fucking...  I'm wired.  Coffee.  Getting up early.  How's the marriage?  It's good sometimes.  You know, it's fucking marriage.  It's fucking...  Oh, boy.  Just fucking...  Sounds like it's got even worse.  She's fucking...  Fucking broads.  You know what?  We're in fucking bed the other night.  I swear to God, I go, I'm hungry.  Maybe I'm going to have...  I swear to God, this is how crazy.  I go, maybe I'm going to have some...  She made chili the other night. 
[01:34:00]  It was fucking great.  I go, I'm going to have a...  You know, and we ate like at 4.30 or early dinner.  So it was like 11.  I was fucking hungry.  I go, maybe...  Why don't we have some pierogies and chili on it, right?  She goes, what's wrong with you?  Why can't you just have a little snack?  You're fucking crying about gaining weight, and it's what you want to eat.  Just have a little snack, like popcorn.  Have popcorn, right?  And she's giving me this lecture.  So I go, okay, well, I'm going to go make something to eat.  What do you want?  She goes, oh, chili. 
[01:34:30]  I swear to God.  And I go, you're fucking just crazy.  You can't...  How bad do your fights get?  Wait, you're crazy too, because you think you're gaining weight?  Yeah, I gained like 10.  You gained a few.  We all see it, right?  We all see it, yeah.  Wait, wait.  When you guys fight, does it ever get to the point where...  Like, is it really nasty fights?  Not like you're a hack type fight, or you're horrible.  Like, we get in fights, like...  Do you ever think you're going to hit her?  Oh, my God.  Honestly, really? 
[01:35:00]  No.  No.  I'm curious.  You're going to take that?  No, I'm wondering.  No, I want to beat her up, but I've never hit a girl.  I'm not going to jail.  But, like, you're going, I could probably pound her.  Really?  You don't get that mad at anybody?  Never.  Yeah, because you've got an easy marriage, a great marriage.  No, but I've had...  But you don't have a lot of...  Fuck that.  You know what a lot of...  Fuck that.  A lot of people say that bullshit.  I've had all the relationships that were horrible.  But I never got to a point where I felt like I could hit her.  When you're married, the most stress, tension, anxiety, whatever, is because of finance. 
[01:35:30]  And if you're financially stable, it takes a lot of pressure off of things.  I agree with that.  Okay?  So, like, she doesn't know my pressure.  She's making movies.  She has her pressure.  She's doing the editing.  My pressure is going on the road and doing these fucking shit gigs, paying for fucking  everything.  Okay?  Two other kids.  This, bills.  I come home.  I got fucking nonstop doing the bills. 
[01:36:00]  I got to book myself.  I'm booking myself.  I'm doing everything.  Do you imagine that or no?  No.  You're talking to him and my agent.  Wow.  So, and I've been, I've been booking myself for over two years now because I don't, I'm  So, what do you do?  Call clubs?  Yeah.  When you're home?  Yeah.  And I hear so many, and the no's I hear are from fucking, it's all, it's all in this  business about fucking numbers.  It's all it is, is numbers now.  It has nothing to do with talent, creativity, originality. 
[01:36:30]  It's fucking numbers.  Well, it is.  Yes, to get the money you wanted, because you could get booked anywhere.  Yeah, if I go for $800 or a thousand.  If you want to go less than you wanted to, what a lot of guys get.  But, so like, when there's a lot of club propaganda, like, when you're booking yourself too, I'm  one of a million guys, so if they say no to me, they go, that's one less guy we got to  deal with, even though, you know, we're dealing with agents, it's tough enough to deal with  them, now we got to deal with guys on their own. 
[01:37:00]  So, like, say I was in Denver at that, fuck the comedy works, right?  And I do crowd work, I mix it up, I know what I'm, I obviously know what I'm doing on  stage.  The feedback was, ah, he did crowd work.  Well, guess what?  It was fucking Halloween weekend, and they were wearing costumes, okay?  So I got to deal with all that shit in life.  He cares how you do crowd work.  I know, it's all bullshit.  It's numbers.  Dude, you're...  It's the bullshit propaganda.  But that's your thing.  You're great at crowd work.  I know, but it has nothing to do...  So I'm dealing with, at home, negative... 
[01:37:30]  Work is not...  There's a lot of positive, too, don't get me wrong.  There's great gigs, and there's shit gigs.  I hear you.  You know, and there's great benefits.  He knows, you know, playing the best golf courses.  I'm doing a show at a fucking TPC course for them.  Edit yourself, Rich.  Get to the point.  Yeah, you really are.  So, you know, we're talking about fighting.  So the pressure's getting to you, and the pressure's getting to you, because you're not making  as much money that you would like.  It's not only the...  Yeah, not as much as I would like, but the fact that I got to do everything to keep the 
[01:38:00]  fucking train moving.  She's doing what she does.  She cleans the house.  She cooks dinner.  She edits the movie.  She loves it.  She's doing stand-up, right?  Once in a while.  She should be doing it full-time.  She's that damn good.  I don't have the time or energy to book her, too.  She doesn't have an agent.  No, she's going to talk to somebody.  Jesus, that's...  She is probably...  She's been doing this movie, though, so, I mean, maybe it's good she hasn't been on  the road, because she's editing.  Yeah, she is.  It's like you almost want her energy into this, because this could be a much bigger thing. 
[01:38:30]  The movie could lead to some big things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A fucking hour with Joan Rivers.  All right, we heard you.  I know, it's just fucking amazing.  That's a good get for you, guys.  Just so fucking good and fun.  You're falling apart.  Nervous breakdown?  I'm not falling apart.  Look how calm I am.  Now you came in, you're really hyper.  Now I've got to take a fucking...  Stop with the Nicolette gum, too.  It's enough time already.  You've got to get off that shit.  How many years?  Years.  What the fuck is this?  An intervention?  Let's do fucking...  No.  But I'm saying you should get off it.  You don't need the nicotine.  Just deal with it.  How many years with the gum? 
[01:39:00]  I almost have five years off of cigarettes.  But five years on the gum.  I almost have five years off of cigarettes.  That's great.  Remember when I couldn't...  Yeah.  Three packs a day?  That's true.  This June will be five fucking years.  But you're obviously...  Over 25 years sober.  Okay, I'm an old timer when it comes to AA.  Five years...  But you're obviously jonesing with the cigarettes, right?  I thought about one yesterday.  I wouldn't smoke it, but I was...  You ever get a craving still?  I am occasionally, sure.  Like, I would love one...  Like, a cigarette would be great.  Yeah.  The first day of smoking would be great, but by month one, I'm going to want to blow my 
[01:39:30]  fucking brains out.  Like, yeah, I'll think of it, but then I'm like, you know what?  Just think about cigarettes, though.  Occasionally, sure.  And for the rest of your life, you're going to have moments, but I know if I do it, I  will be right back to where I was, and I'll be fucking the breath and the fucking...  It's that fucking horrible, horrible life.  I have a tough time breathing still, and it's...  Is smoking that good?  No, it's not addicting.  But I never got it.  I never got why a cigarette feels so good.  Sometimes it just feels right.  I remember when I quit smoking for six months, and I started up, within a day, I was right 
[01:40:00]  back to where I left off.  Within a day.  Jeez.  There's no fucking...  Danny's right.  Sometimes it just feels right, though.  All right.  There's no explanation.  Do you smoke?  No, actually...  Danny's been off for a while.  Four years later this month.  Very good.  Wise Guys Comedy Club, Trolley Square, Salt...  You get to go to Salt Lake City?  This weekend, yeah.  You booked yourself in Salt Lake?  Yeah, is that...  Yeah, the guy listens to this station, and he emails me.  The owner goes, I love you on radio, and I like your comedy.  Would you do some skiing out there? 
[01:40:30]  No, not in a million years.  You want to ski?  Why?  You never hear a good story out of skiing or hiking.  I agree.  You don't hear a good story.  I've skied my whole life.  And I've never heard a good story come out of it.  Not once.  Well, because I don't want to bore the people with my ski stories.  I bore them enough with this crap.  It's probably fun, but...  You want me to have fucking ski stories, too?  At least you can Twitter it.  I mean, it's not like...  True.  I'm going down the mountain.  All right, I'll tweet a good ski story.  Holy shit.  Wiseguyscomedy.com for Rich this Friday, Saturday. 
[01:41:00]  Salt Lake City.  I actually want to...  I got offered a gig in Utah, too.  I want to go to Salt Lake City.  I hear it's awesome.  What the fuck?  Are you...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No.  No, I really...  Have you been there?  No.  I just said I heard it was awesome, so that means I haven't been there.  I'm going to play golf Saturday.  I already set up a course.  That's cool.  Unless there's somebody who wants to take me to a private course, but...  Hey, before we go to break, can I show a video I made yesterday of a monster I met?  Okay.  Do you mind?  I got recognized yesterday on the streets, and I met a real-life monster. 
[01:41:30]  You got recognized?  It happens, Rich.  I know, but I'm saying from radio, that's the good thing about radio.  I haven't been on TV in a while, so yeah, you're right.  So the recognition has drastically dropped, but it still happens.  It's called My Biggest Fan.  It's on my Twitter, OP Radio.  I was with Roland walking around.  There's two videos of me with Roland.  The other one's a good story that we can tell after the break.  Roland, we're walking, and we just ran into a uber fan. 
[01:42:00]  I'm like shaking, look at me.  Why are you shaking?  Because I listen every day since I was 15.  I'm 21.  Oh, you've been listening for six years?  Yeah.  And I'm your favorite, right?  What is wrong with her?  Well, her mouth is crooked.  First of all, her taste in radio.  She's a big fan.  She's a bit off.  Danny, I saw you cover your mouth.  What's wrong?  It's really cool to have Rumor Willis as a fan.  That's really cool. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, wow.  It might be just a jaw thing.  But what about her left eye?  We need more time on that.  And then someone wants to know if it's a tranny that the operation went bad.  No.  It's not a tranny?  But does she...  And does she have like two real eyes?  There's a lot going on here.  I don't know if it's too...  She's like a cartoon character.  It might be two inside, I guess, but her face is shaped like the episode of Always Sunny  when they think that Dennis is a serial...  No, a child molester.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you remember how he had that prosthetic on where he's got this big, round, awful face? 
[01:43:00]  All right, continue.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's me.  Hang on.  My favorite.  Why?  Today was so funny.  Today was funny?  Yeah.  Who were you?  I was Catherine.  She doesn't listen, but I was actually just telling her about the half-nice thing.  She talks like you.  She was laughing.  Yeah.  I was hysterical.  It was fun.  Wait, about what?  Today, when you were talking about the half-slices, I'm...  Oh, the half-slices.  Yeah.  That's like a gay pizza joint that Jay Moore wants to sell.  Because, like, gays, you know, they want to watch their figures, so they only want half 
[01:43:30]  a slice, right?  Funny, right?  Roland, I think I found a girl for you.  You want to go out with Roland?  I would...  Yeah, I said he was cute.  I commented...  I said I wanted to poke him.  Oh, you want to take a look?  Go ahead.  This is what happens.  You're evil.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that amazing?  That's amazing.  Just amazing.  All right.  That's amazing.  So you want a picture or something?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Who's got the camera?  She's shaking.  She had the camera.  Oh.  Is the camera set?  Oh, yeah.  Who does?  We're running away.  Oh, no.  We ran away.  See, that's the punchline.  We ran away from the monster who wanted a picture.  She wasn't bad.  She seemed like a fine-enough-looking gal.  She was kind of cute, yeah.  What do you think the problem is?  Jay Moore has entered the studio. 
[01:44:30]  I ran down the hallway because I heard Mushmouth was here.  I was like, oh, my God.  It's the first time you exercise this month.  It's true.  Wow.  He attacked me.  I attacked back.  How about you shut up before I get rolling in here to kick your ass again?  Oh, remember that?  You weren't even here.  I was here.  No.  No, we heard about it.  I'm always here, bro.  I'm crazy.  Don't touch his ears.  What do you think is wrong with her, though?  A stroke.  She had a stroke as a kid.  A stroke?  I'm making fun of someone who had a stroke.  No, she's all right. 
[01:45:00]  She's not what's going on with the lady at all.  That's why her speech was wrong in her face.  She was nice.  I ran into a fan yesterday, and Jay, she liked the half a slice bit that you came up with.  It wasn't me.  It was Ronnie.  Ronnie did the half a slice.  Ronnie did the half a slice, and then I got the giggles because I said it to Paul Reiser.  And then you went with it.  You know, I really slept on this Paul Reiser situation.  Was he in studio?  He was a fucking bore.  And I figured out what the problem was.  And we tried.  He sat there and goes, you know, I didn't want to work.  I didn't want to write anything.  I don't want to act. 
[01:45:30]  And then I'm like, then what the fuck are you doing here?  He came into a comic strip on Friday night.  He came in to do guest spots.  He said he tagged.  He did?  I went on after him.  It was so good to have him open because the audience was just so happy to see fucking me.  You know, it's still stuck in the 80s.  If he's going on in a room, he should be going on at, like, Gotham or the Cellar.  Because the strip is a younger, like, it's not the room it was when he was working in.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He just kept telling us how he doesn't want to work. 
[01:46:00]  And he doesn't want to.  I mean, I really, like, slept on it.  Because Ronnie kept hitting home, like, how uncomfortable it was.  And I didn't really particularly think it was that bizarre as Ronnie was playing it.  It was uncomfortable because we weren't getting anything out of him.  And he's supposed to be a funny guy.  He's a comic.  And there's a room full of funny guys.  And he had nothing.  I think he just was really trying.  He won't be working next week.  No, I just heard.  And then he's downplaying the sitcom.  Like, yeah, it's a middle of the season replacement.  He didn't even think much of his.  Hey, Roland. 
[01:46:30]  Are you guys square now?  Roland and boss?  Me and Roland go way back now.  All right.  I heard he bent you up like a goddamn pretzel.  Oh, boy.  He came in.  He fucking destroyed me, man.  Do we have that audio?  All right.  Well, I know.  They're the end of that bit.  Here's the help.  No, no.  Yes, he beat me.  This is what bothered me the most.  Not the fact that he destroyed me.  We were playing Scrabble, and I was killing him, and he came in and flipped the board.  And I was fucking beating him in Scrabble.  He's never beaten me in Scrabble.  I was winning by 80 fucking points.  You could win at Scrabble because you don't have to pronounce any of the words.  You just have to lay them down. 
[01:47:00]  You know what?  You throw enough against the wall.  One sticks.  He's fucking a bad speller, too.  He's not a good speller.  Say, I want church on Tuesday.  I missed you, Rich.  I missed you.  I ran down the halls.  I swear.  I ran down the hall, and they go, oh, Rich Boss is in there.  Hey, man.  And you lost a little muscle mass yourself with your little front porch you got going.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  You got a little belly on you?  That's true, right?  He did a little belly on you.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  All right.  Old man abs.  Put some underpants on.  I got fucking Iggy Pop abs. 
[01:47:30]  After I saw him without his shirt on, I want to stop working out.  Fucking horrible.  He looks like he looked into the arc.  Did you see him?  Too many words.  Jay, right back with the buttons.  Listen, we're going to break, Jay, because we've been going an hour.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to play.  You want to play it into break, or when we get back?  We got the role in conversation with Rich Voss.  So the bit's not over.  I'd love to hear it.  We're not going to hear it into break, so we'll play it in show. 
[01:48:00]  After the break, we'll do that, okay?  Okay.  Okay, Bobby.  And Jay's going to be at Gotham tonight.  Rich, you want to open for me?  Huh?  You want to come to Gotham tonight?  What's your day?  Today's Tuesday.  You're still back on Tuesday.  I'm off today.  How much?  Maybe a couple hundred bucks.  Yeah, I'll do a couple hundred.  How much do you get for a spot someplace?  I don't do spots.  I headline Gotham, too.  So it would be a...  Then why am I giving you money at all?  Just come by and say hi and do some time for everybody.  I live in Jersey.  I'm going to drive home from here and then come all the way back.  It's a fucking hour home.  Jay, we just talked finances with Rich. 
[01:48:30]  Give him a couple hundred bucks, please.  That's what happened.  Please give him a couple hundred bucks.  I called him on his couple hundred things, and he re-evaluated and said, you know what?  Maybe $300 is too much money for a...  Because Joe Madarese, it's just a two-man show.  He's a funny dude, though.  I don't have an emcee ever.  I hate it.  I have to have a two-man show.  Because I piss between the feature and myself.  I have to.  I'm pissing shit the entire time the guy's up there for the entire 20 minutes.  And then I don't get introduced.  They just play music.  And then when the music plays, it's just a blank stage.  And they just walk out?  Just walk off stage. 
[01:49:00]  They know why they're here.  You've seen him on the...  That's the great credit.  You've seen him on Comedy Central.  Yeah.  You know your credit.  Why don't you fly in Dina Cola from obscurity and take him off?  No one knows what that means.  Why are you making fun of Mike?  I do.  Poor Mike.  Five people got that.  Yeah.  I do.  Credit is very funny, but only five people got that.  Nobody wants the razor-sharp mind of an FBI profiler.  Turn on them.  Save that for after the break.  That's too much for Jay Moore right now.  We got some stuff to explain at the break. 
[01:49:30]  Are you doing Gotham?  Hold on.  Rich Voss just pointed at me and said, look at his head.  Rich.  Rich.  Nice head.  Like, what do we mean?  Fucking Valley View Road, New Jersey?  Hey, nice head.  Don't get wise.  Are you going to do Gotham tonight?  Let's negotiate this.  Do Jay Moore's Gotham show tonight.  You can make fun of me the whole time.  And then Rich is going to hit the...  I guess Matt O'Reese on it.  How would I do it?  Do you want me to host it?  Yeah, host it.  How about I just bring you up to do some time so I can have a rest? 
[01:50:00]  What do you mean?  During your act?  Whatever.  Whenever.  He'll fucking...  It's fucking horrible.  I'm not going to fucking, you know...  If you don't want to do it, don't do it.  I'll host it.  But I don't want to fucking go in pocket for no reason.  I'm going to do time.  I'll do 20 up front.  Right, but it's like a luxury that we don't need.  It's a luxury to have you there.  Because I do think you're hilarious.  He'd love you to do a guest spot.  But if I was in town, I would love you to do a guest spot.  So just hang out in the city.  Just sleep on the subway. 
[01:50:30]  Just ride the subway back and forth.  25 years.  I used to do that all the time.  Yeah, and how's it working out for you?  You fucking silt.  You just complained to everybody you have no money.  I have enough.  I mean, I keep putting it into this movie.  You want to...  He used to book himself.  He used to book himself.  He's no agent.  No book.  Jason Steinberg.  No, first of all, he was my manager.  He wasn't my personal appearance guy.  What's the difference?  5%.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid. 
[01:51:00]  Magic.  Listen, Rich Ross is going to be at Wise Guys Comedy Club, Trolley Square, Salt Lake City,  Friday and Saturday.  Oh, that place is the best.  Jay, save it.  For real?  We're going to break it.  We'll rock until 10.  Salt Lake City.  Go see Rich Ross.  And Jay Moore tonight at Gotham.  We'll continue.  Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion 3 Show.  Opinion 3. 
[01:51:30]  All right, now it's me and Rich.  Lost Jay Moore and Jim Norton.  I don't have anything to say to you.  I know.  I'm tired.  We've hung out enough.  I don't have any questions for you anymore.  When are you taking me out to dinner and Bonnie for sushi?  You know what?  I think this is the last show until Anthony gets back.  I think I'm going to fucking shut her down.  Take a few days myself. 
[01:52:00]  So, you want to play golf?  Yes.  Are you around?  Next week?  I'll be back Monday.  No, I can play golf tomorrow or Thursday.  I can't play Thursday.  I can play tomorrow.  But it's going to rain tomorrow.  Oh, it is?  All right.  We'll figure it out after the show.  I'll play next week, definitely.  Yeah.  Are you off next week?  No.  It took two weeks and, yeah, a lot of people are confused, but I have a kid.  I can't go anywhere.  It's tough to go on vacation.  He's 11 months now and my girl's still at school and doing other stuff. 
[01:52:30]  So, we're fucking locked up.  So, I'm like, am I going to sit home for two weeks or can I come in and do a few shows?  So, I decided to do a few shows.  And now I'll take a few days off and relax a little bit.  That's all.  I usually go away, but this is one of those years I don't think I can do that.  Why?  Take the baby on a trip.  I'm not ready.  When did you start taking the baby on the trip, Jay?  Too early.  It's too early, right?  I took my son to Hawaii when he was like three years old.  Well, three.  I'm talking about an 11-month-old.  Well, if you don't mind, do you have a nanny? 
[01:53:00]  No.  Where do you want to go?  I don't trust anyone yet.  What do you mean you don't trust anybody yet?  I don't trust anyone yet.  You trust yourself?  Barely.  You just ran away from a fat girl in the street.  Barely.  And my kid was strapped to me, by the way.  He was like, what the hell are you doing?  He gave me a, what the hell are you doing look?  You're running up Fifth Avenue like Earl Campbell.  Right.  Away from that monster.  He's from my hometown.  No one cares.  Iowa, Texas?  Oh, no.  I meant Mill Campbell.  Huh?  Mill Campbell.  I learned something from Jay. 
[01:53:30]  I'll say it again.  I learned something from Jay's book.  Don't do anything significant with your kid until at least three or four.  What are you talking about?  Because they don't remember anything.  They don't have a memory of it.  That's not true.  Yeah.  Early memory.  Go.  What's your memory?  Not the memory your parents told you.  You remember you wore those little cowboy boots?  No.  I remember when my, I remember when I remember once walking down to the river, to the brook,  getting undressed and walking home naked when all the kids were getting out from school.  I remember walking to the river.  Do you remember the older man that took you there and brutally sodomized you by the rocks? 
[01:54:00]  And made you walk home by yourself without your clothes?  Put your little Jewish face in the mud.  I like how Rich can't think of an answer.  So he just looks at Jimmy and goes, huh?  So Jimmy will repeat it so he can think of a fucking joke.  That's how you do it.  You go, what?  How old were you, Rich?  I was probably three.  You remember walking around naked in Jersey?  Yes, I remember walking into the basement, taking a shit in the basement, just taking  a dump on the floor. 
[01:54:30]  At three-ish?  Yeah.  That's not anti-social behavior.  Yeah.  What about you, Jimmy?  Earliest memory?  Being a turtle-back zoo, I vaguely remember.  Yeah, visiting relatives.  Boss.  That was a great one.  Oh, boy.  That's a knockout.  Yes, I was a turtle-back zoo when I was young. 
[01:55:00]  How old were you?  Eleven.  Perfect.  Nothing was better the other day when you go, you're just a great comic, and just congratulations  on everything, and Richard Gervais goes, oh, thanks, mate.  He goes, I was talking to Louis.  Anyway, my first memory was, my first memory was, I was at the Passaic River with my parents  and we were having a picnic, and a naked Jewish kid walked up, and he said, what's not everybody 
[01:55:30]  scaring at me for?  Who's seen my diaper?  I'm wearing Huggies 11 now.  I'm a big boy.  No, it was like looking up the street, just weird snippets of like, how old?  I would say four, but that's like, we're talking about like a slideshow of a memory.  Like one photo.  That's a frame.  Like you don't remember like going on like Barnegat Bay and fishing at like four years  old.  Like, come on, we'll take him.  It'll be great. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  Well, my son doesn't remember shit that happened at school that day.  It's like they wipe his fucking slate clean every day.  You remember fucking Dr. Moore.  You remember things, you know that you...  He's saving people a lot of money.  Listen to me.  Here's the thing.  Excuse me.  With kids, whether they remember or not, a kid's foundation is being with his parents,  being loved, and they know...  How would you know?  You're not loved.  He knows what I'm talking about.  So, if your kid is with you on vacation, this and that, there might not be memories of 
[01:56:30]  the vacation, but the feeling of love will translate.  Yeah, but you don't need to go to Disney to get that done.  Don't you think I love my child just as much in the Pacific Palisades?  Exactly.  Not as much as you would love him in Hawaii.  In Hawaii, it's a pain in my ass.  It's the reason I'm not sleeping until noon, because of this kid.  Right.  You know what I'm saying.  Everybody, we're going to get laid.  The memories are there, but...  But he's right.  You can do those memories at home.  And you could also go on vacation and do them, too.  You do not not go on vacation, because you have a kid. 
[01:57:00]  Where's my book?  I'm going to just read from it.  Well, you'll be the only one.  Yeah, it'd be funny if it wasn't on the New York Times list.  Every book is.  Okay, I didn't even write a book, and it's on there.  What's it called?  It's called, I didn't write a book, and it's on there.  It's called...  Every book doesn't make a list.  I have sushi.  Not even close.  Every book doesn't make a list.  You've got to sell 6,000 books to crack the top 15 on that list.  6,000?  In the first weekend.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't chew gum into the mic.  It's bad enough.  We gave up on that.  Nicorette gum.  With your Warren Beatty teeth. 
[01:57:30]  Nicorette gum for five years.  Brand new.  33,000 implants.  You're the only guy I know that brags about terrible shit.  You want to see the YouTube?  You want to see some fucking gross?  You want to see my teeth?  Thirty-three thousand dollars.  Listen to me, elephant man.  Turn on.  Go to YouTube.  Go to fucking YouTube, and you'll see the grossest thing.  They filmed it.  And when they're shooting Nova, it's fucking...  It is a good video.  You without teeth is disturbing.  Really quickly, from the Nibrex website.  Hold on.  The recommended course of therapy is 12 weeks for the gum.  Yeah.  You've been on it for five years. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I was on cocaine for 20-something years.  All right, you know, that's a good point.  Good point.  I'm going to stop.  You got me.  You're going to Trolley Square, wise guys.  Yeah.  That's the room that holds 80 people.  It's like 100 people.  No, it's...  All right.  Sorry.  Yeah, it's not a lot.  You're right.  So what are you saying?  You're doing a room with 100 people?  Don't make it feel bad.  He's flying across the country.  Jay, don't make it feel bad.  Listen, I'll make the room.  I told him it's like my favorite city.  I love that place.  First of all, I'm getting the money I need.  This much?  Huh?  No.  What are you kidding me? 
[01:58:30]  I wouldn't do that over the phone.  You missed the hour before you got here, Jay.  It's very depressing.  No.  Ask him what he does on the road.  It's not depressing.  Ask him what he does on the road besides play golf.  I have the elephant man's head.  Who gives a fuck about his finances?  No.  I obviously need a doctor.  This is not a finance thing.  I'm John Merrick.  You talk like the fucking guy.  Okay, so we can do it.  You're going to sleep in a fucking chair.  Here's the difference.  I don't have to talk.  We still have to look at you.  Here's the difference.  You do have to talk, Rich.  It's your fucking job.  That's your whole fucking library. 
[01:59:00]  You're not to talk.  There's only 80 people there.  They don't care.  You look at a guy hitting zero that just bats fucking lead off every night.  He's doof.  I'm doof.  I never fail on stage.  Never.  Tell Jay Moore what you do on the road besides play golf because it's deeply depressing and  we got to hear it again.  I forgot.  What do I do?  He makes believe.  Ready for this?  Oh, what do I do?  That he's an FBI profiler.  When they say, what do you do for a living?  On the golf course because you don't want to talk about comedy.  No, but he wants to talk about being an FBI profiler.  Right. 
[01:59:30]  That's what he tells people.  He's living out this fantasy of just being a smart guy.  Very smart.  And then we asked him basic shit that he didn't know.  He didn't know the names of the serial killers that he was profiling.  But here's the thing.  The public doesn't know those questions that you know.  He probably dropped the guy on Long Island off.  He had no idea it was him.  There's a serial killer.  Yeah, I know.  They just found Body 10.  Did they?  Oh, let's hear a little bit about it.  Yeah, you're the FBI profiler.  They went past their perimeter, and they're outside their perimeter, and they went farther. 
[02:00:00]  Who was they?  First of all, it's called his comfort zone.  It's not called the perimeter.  No, the perimeter where the bodies were found.  You need the lingo.  The comfort zone.  The comfort zone is where he kills or his comfort for killing.  And they went outside his comfort zone.  No, no.  They went outside the perimeter of where the bodies were found, the other eight bodies.  That's the comfort zone.  Which would be the fucking comfort zone.  So the comfort zone is where he is killing in his comfort zone.  When did you have to get that shirt back to a black act? 
[02:00:30]  I would, but I don't know his real name.  It's a rugby shirt.  J.B. Smoove?  Smoove.  Ruckus!  And tell him about the lookouts.  What?  He's got lookouts.  The minor league team?  The Chattanooga lookouts?  He's got lookouts.  So anyhow, let's get back to Wise Guys.  No, when he's in the FBI, you've got lookouts.  Yeah, I've got lookouts.  You want to call someone from the FBI?  You got one?  Tell me about the lookouts.  Well, when we were digging up the fake bodies in Atlanta, we had lookouts to see who was 
[02:01:00]  in the crowd and if there was any white people, and there was no white people, so we knew  that the white, the serial killer wasn't white.  That's all.  You know, it's hard to explain serial killers.  Serial killers are normally white, yeah.  I know, but this one was black in Atlanta.  There's a lot more black ones than you'd think, though.  They just kill their own race.  They're fucking white girls.  Jesus.  They're just killing their own race.  What did you say, Rich?  Nothing.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  So, tell me about Wise Guys.  If you know the room, obviously you work there.  No, it's because I play the big room, and then you go, well, who's in the little room?  It's adorable.  That's me.  Trolley Square.  I'm looking forward to this.  It's awesome.  First of all, I love it.  And Keith Stubbs is great.  The owner's great.  Yeah.  And Salt Lake City is the coolest town.  It's the cleanest.  I haven't offered to go there.  I've never been.  You gotta go.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I hear nothing about good things about that.  It's so clean and great.  I already said that.  It's incredible. 
[02:02:00]  And the more, like, I had this whole preconceived notion of Mormons.  They're the fucking best.  The whole religion is based on fucking hanging out with your family.  Not the polygamists, the real, you know, the OG Mormons.  What are you doing, Salt Lake, though?  What's there to do?  I'm gonna play golf.  Where do you go anywhere?  I mean, you guys, do you do shit on the road?  I just fucking sleep and watch Law & Order.  Depends.  Oh, Law & Order's the word.  Have you ever seen a black criminal on that fucking show?  No.  They're all white.  No.  Yes. 
[02:02:30]  Every killer on Law, every crook on Law & Order is white.  Did you ever see the gay, when Ice-T had to break up the gay black athlete ring?  No.  There's a gay black, I didn't even know what the crime, it was on SVU, I didn't even know  what the crime was.  And apparently, like, a quarterback, one of them had HIV and he was, like, spreading HIV  to other athletes and he was gonna ruin the whole league.  And it was like a fucking Scooby-Doo episode.  It was bizarre.  And he goes undercover and he goes to, like, barbecues and shit.  And then he comes back in, like, halfway through the episode.  You didn't see this? 
[02:03:00]  Halfway through the episode, he comes in, he goes, turns out our man Jesse O'Brien, he's  on the damn low.  And then he leaves.  Like, that's his undercover work.  Like, there's no photography, no written report.  There's no, like, you know, no one wore a white...  He just goes, he comes in in his floor-length sweeper, leather coat, and he goes, he's on  the damn low.  And he leaves.  And then they go fucking break it up.  They're doing Law & Order Portland next year.  Why'd you do that?  I watched some of Law & Order L.A. last night for the first time. 
[02:03:30]  I love it.  Do you?  I love it.  The lead guy who was in Spider-Man is good.  Melina?  Is that his name?  Yeah.  Let's call an FBI.  What did you watch last night?  What do you want to ask an FBI man?  Man-man.  Let's talk to a real FBI person.  I don't want...  I'm not...  I'm gonna call a CIA guy.  We all have phone numbers, okay?  You gotta tell him he's on the air before you're off the air first.  You can't just put him on.  I'm gonna have him take care of you when you go up to Salt Lake.  He can't just have him into the mic.  Jay, you can't just do that.  All right.  Well, I can have a conversation amongst yourself. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, Matt.  It's Jay Moore.  You're on the radio, so don't curse.  You can curse.  I turned it down.  How do I put it?  What?  Oh, no.  Is he all right?  He's all right now.  Yeah.  That's all right.  All right.  All right.  Are you all right to be on the radio?  Yeah, just put him on speaker and throw the phone next to the fucking microphone.  What do you sound very busy?  It's probably a crime scene.  It's probably taking up bodies on the beach.  In Utah.  I got a comic.  He's outside.  You asshole.  I got a comedian coming up.  He's playing Trolley Square. 
[02:04:30]  When are you going there?  Friday, Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  This guy's really great.  Are you going to be up there at that time?  All right.  His name is Rich Voss.  Please arrest him.  Who?  Did he just say?  Voss is coming in?  Look at Voss.  That's Jewish with the feds.  Yeah.  Fellow profiler.  Yeah.  We were just making fun of him because when he plays golf, he tells the people he's golfing  with that he's an FBI profiler.  So I said, you'll get along great with Shrum.  With Dormat Shrum.  Ask him if he read John Douglas books. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Go break Voss's balls when he comes up there.  Okay?  Ask him if he read John Douglas.  He started.  He started.  I know who he is.  Journey into darkness.  Yeah, I know.  I know who Robert Ressler is.  I know who they are.  I know who they are.  Three of them.  Fucking doll radio.  Sorry.  That's all right.  I thought it would be more exciting.  Is he from Salt Lake?  Yeah.  What are the odds that you have an FBI guy's card in your wallet?  I got about 14 states.  And why do you keep a wallet in your front pocket?  Because so girls can check out my ass. 
[02:05:30]  It's also not bad.  It's bad for you to sit on your wallet.  It's very bad for your back.  Not your wallet because there's nothing in it, Rich.  Yeah, you're all.  It's fine.  So why are you in Financial Straits?  It's crazy in here.  One Discover card.  It's crazy.  One Discover card.  A diner club.  A Radio Shack battery club card.  Why are you in Financial Straits?  You just hit the hat trick on that one.  That was funny.  Funny stuff.  What part of that run wasn't funny?  Exactly.  That was a good run, Rich.  It was about me.  He said Discover.  He said Diners Club.  He said Discover.  He said Diners Club.  I said Radio Shack.  I started with the thin wallet.  Batteries Club card. 
[02:06:00]  That's a fucking comedy pyramid.  What was your question you asked?  Why?  I wasn't here when we were talking about your financial straits.  What's happening with you, man?  Nothing.  He books himself.  You know this business.  You mean nothing.  I come in and Opie goes, oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  No, I'm not making it.  It was a sad hour.  Listen, you're like, nothing's wrong.  No, no.  I'm financing our movie.  So I'm going on the road.  Bonnie and I are making a movie called Women Aren't Funny.  It's a comedy documentary.  Everybody's in it.  Why didn't you get Jay Moore's?  He was in L.A.  Is it too late to get Jay Moore's?  We're getting big acts. 
[02:06:30]  Why don't you get Jay Moore?  It's not too late.  We're done filming.  We would throw him in maybe for a cameo.  You know what my special's called?  No.  Funny for a Girl.  Yeah.  It's interesting that you had a whole thing.  Women Aren't Funny that we have copyrighted.  But anyhow.  I'm not using your title.  I'm saying.  Relax, Rich.  Relax.  Let's get still your idea at this point.  So I'm saying.  Who wants to.  Are you kidding me?  This is.  Believe you me.  I'm just breaking your balls. 
[02:07:00]  This is a great project.  Tiny, horrible hands you have.  Okay.  Really?  Come on, Matt.  Roll off.  Finish your story.  I like that.  Vinnie Brand sounds just like him, too.  Like who?  You got to know the show.  Matt Roll off.  Come on, stiff fingers.  You got to know the show.  You got to have Vinnie Brand on.  Come on.  Open up a fucking pumpkin patch or finish your story.  One or the other.  Exactly.  Do a magical dance.  You're really doing little.  That was a fucking.  You're really doing little people big world humor for ten people out there. 
[02:07:30]  That was a fucking riddle.  Come on.  For real.  What's going on with your finances?  Nothing.  I mean.  Why is he buying to go out there?  I'm not making the money I was making.  Why not?  But I will.  It goes up and down.  You know the business goes up and down.  No.  Just pretty.  It's kind of like just a nice plateau for guys like Jimmy and I.  All it goes up.  Well.  Why did it go down for you?  Did you take the company enough?  Why?  Because I'm not doing the numbers I was doing.  No one is.  And I'll tell you.  Huh?  No one is.  The economy is now.  No.  Jimmy is.  In some places.  Well.  Some places.  Fucking five sold out shows in Columbus? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  That was good.  To fucking.  You had to play for Ohio State to fucking make that happen.  Yeah.  It was good.  It was going to be Nick Mangold.  I know.  It wasn't that funny, Rich.  You know the fucking critique.  One thing about Rich.  It's like the fucking comedy police.  I wasn't even paying attention.  If I was kind of pleased, you'd be arrested ten times over.  But I wasn't paying attention.  I was daydreaming about what you.  The big case.  Keep it on.  Keep it on.  Why numbers are down.  Stop commenting here.  I was daydreaming about why numbers are down.  Exactly.  After last comic.  Why is he thinking?  Because I was daydreaming. 
[02:08:30]  After last comic, when we went on tour, we were selling out fucking theaters and clubs.  But I couldn't.  Huh?  You're lucky I didn't take you guys to fucking court.  You went out on tour with a fucking show name that I created.  No.  That's not true.  You're wrong.  Last Comic Standing 2 T-O-O.  No.  Comics of Last Comic.  It's just like saying.  Comics of Last Comic Standing is my fucking show.  Where's my taste?  Where's your taste?  You, you, motherfucker.  Listen to me.  I made that show, so shut the fuck up.  You did, man.  You were fantastic on the show.  Thank you.  I lobbied for you to be on it. 
[02:09:00]  You lobbied?  You should be a little fucking nicer to me.  You fucking lobbied for me to be on it?  You guys begged me.  I was going to say no to it.  And what did I say?  And what did you say?  You called me and said, do the show.  And I said, okay.  Rich, I will never in my life try to convince someone to be on television.  That's what I said to you.  That's true.  Whatever.  I said, I'm never going to call someone and try to convince them they should be on television.  So, who was on the tour?  So, how's that me begging you to be on the fucking team?  Because you called me and we talked for 40 minutes.  What part?  When you fucking went and auditioned for the show?  That's me calling you and begging you?  No, listen to me, dummy.  You went and stood in line like a fucking herb. 
[02:09:30]  No, I didn't.  You fucking jamoke.  Listen.  I went to the first.  You thought jamoke was going to get a big laugh.  No, no.  He fucking paused.  He said jamoke and fucking took a break, though.  I usually don't pause.  Usually don't pause.  You fucking jamoke?  Beat, beat, beat, go.  I'm not going to fight everybody.  Is there a real issue here with you and Jay?  No, I like you.  I played fucking golf with him.  I showed him my asshole.  What are you kidding me?  We've all seen your asshole, though.  You talk out of it.  That's a high to you.  That's not special.  We've all seen the ass.  But the thing with Rich, you guys got a real issue that goes way back? 
[02:10:00]  What are you kidding me?  I think Rich is hilarious, but for Rich to go like, you begged me to be here.  No, I didn't say you said that.  He just said that.  You did just say that.  Okay, here's the thing.  But you said before that.  Who was on the tour?  What did you say before that?  Exactly.  You went on tour.  Who was on the tour?  With the Last Comic Standing tour.  It wasn't.  It was me, Dave, and Corey, the first season.  And those are three people that run a show called what?  Last Comic Standing.  Yes.  What was the name of the tour?  Rich, Dave, and Corey.  That's not the fucking name of the tour.  There was no name of the tour. 
[02:10:30]  It's a fucking internet in front of me.  He's scared that you still want your taste.  No, there's no possible.  When you say comics from Last Comic Standing.  Right.  That's my show.  Yeah, right.  But it's not saying Last Comic Standing tour.  What if right now?  I could go on tour right now and say comics from Opie and Anthony, and I wouldn't have  to.  No way, man.  I could say comics from, yes, I could.  I'm a comic from Opie and Anthony.  What fucking planet are you from that you can go on tour and market your tour, comics  from the Opie and Anthony show without Opie getting a fucking bite?  You're saying when you go on the road, you can't use any of your television credits. 
[02:11:00]  No, it's not using your credits.  You're selling the name of the show as their show.  Yeah.  You can't.  Yeah.  No, I'm saying comics from.  We understand what from means.  Get a lawyer on the phone.  Get a lawyer on the phone.  You're a fucking Jew.  You call one.  I don't need it.  Get a lawyer on the phone.  Get a lawyer on the phone.  You're getting nervous that he's going to ask for his text.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  All right.  So you were doing theaters.  And the reason I didn't hold on to that audience is because the people that used to  watch Last Comic Standing.  The people, though. 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  Expected clean television.  And then they come to see me live, and I'm talking about hot loads on their back, and  that's not what they were used to.  It's also hard because there's a new crop every year of people.  But then season two.  You were in season one, right?  He was on twice.  He was on two seasons.  He got two.  And I made it to the finals to the end in both.  That's how powerful Rich Voss is, bitches.  Okay?  You know, if you guys were in season one, you're playing in front of 80 people.  If they were on the air, if they were still on the air, I would have won it.  You would have won.  If you guys were on the air, he would have won. 
[02:12:00]  Season one?  Yeah.  We were on the air at that point.  You had a square asshole, you bricks.  I don't want to hear that shit.  You remember you were taking pictures of me in Montreal?  It fucking killed me.  Trust me.  I remember.  You heard that story?  All of a sudden, these girls come up to us.  Can I get a picture?  I'm like, yeah, of course.  I'm going to be from Montreal.  And all of a sudden, they hand me the camera.  They wanted a picture of Rich Voss.  It was the worst day of my life.  Wow.  That's a big...  It was the worst day of my life.  It's a precipitous drop.  And Rich has never let me forget that, by the way. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, was that a bummer?  Hysterical.  Two planes collided on the runway.  I know it, JFK.  A fender bender on the fucking tarmac.  You would think they would have that figured out by now.  That first season was fucking great.  But how do you...  I like how you got off your point of you don't have to give money to me for saying comedians  of Last Comic Standing.  Well, first of all, I don't.  And second of all, if I had to give money to anybody, it would be to Peter Engel, right?  Who was my partner.  Me and Peter Engel split our back end. 
[02:13:00]  Well, I already paid him, so you better get your money from him.  You still get a piece of that, right?  You get a taste of it?  Is he a creator?  Yeah.  You still get a taste?  It's NBC and then me and Peter.  It's split three ways.  I'll tell you, that one fucking girl, Eliza, looked good last year on TV.  Eliza?  Schlesinger?  Yeah, she looked fucking...  I feel like girls.  Is she pretty?  I've met her.  I'm close.  She's all right.  She's cute, but I don't remember.  I thought girls weren't funny.  Did she win?  I was trying to talk to you.  I didn't say...  Who said funny?  I said pretty. 
[02:13:30]  No, you said...  She was good when I worked with her.  I didn't say they weren't.  Did she win or no?  Yes.  Good times, you freak.  No, you don't like me at talks.  Look at that.  She looks good in that.  Let me see.  A lot.  She doesn't.  Bonnie's a beautiful girl.  Yeah.  He doesn't think so anymore.  I do, too.  Not really.  She let herself go?  No.  We've seen it in your eyes.  You don't think so anymore.  It's all right.  Did she get put on some pounds?  I like the way her hand is positioned on her hip.  It feels good.  Bonnie's fucking hot, Rich.  She's good.  What's wrong with you?  They're hot.  You know, it's so funny when...  I don't see it. 
[02:14:00]  But here's the thing.  You don't see that Bonnie's hot?  No, she was hot when I first met her.  She's hot.  What about when you look at Neil Brennan?  Do you go, yeah, Bonnie is hot?  That's hilarious.  What's going on with you, too?  Isn't he making things?  There's nothing going on.  This is a Paul Reiser thing happening.  No.  There's nothing going on.  Why, did you have a problem with Paul?  We had Paul Reiser in yesterday.  We don't want to go back to the Paul Reiser thing.  Did you fucking listen to what we were just talking about?  I didn't know if you had a problem.  I didn't know if you had a fight on the argument.  He's too busy thinking of one-liners about the elephant, man. 
[02:14:30]  I didn't.  Go back to the...  That's already good.  Let it go.  I didn't know if you guys were marketing.  Okay, Rocky Dennis.  I know it's not funny.  I just wanted to strip it from you.  Yeah, you should be like Rocky Balboa or something.  Oh, yeah.  Word.  People are...  Do you want to move on?  Uh, can we...  Can you...  I like people...  The whole, uh...  Oh, you want to go to the phones?  Jay Moore's an intellectual bully.  People are begging you to stop chewing the fucking gum. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, it's really annoying.  They're begging at this point.  You're going to be all right without the gum?  Yeah, really, they're begging.  Frank and Bill.  Not as chomp.  Is it loud?  You can hear it?  Yeah, no.  You're doing it to a microphone.  All right.  Relax.  Oh, wait.  Here's a lawyer from Jersey.  You're fucked.  Which one?  Rob?  All right.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Uh, Rob.  Voss, you're a fucking idiot.  Shut up.  Jerk off.  You're a lawyer.  Good one.  How do you think you're going to use somebody's name and not pay them?  I'm not using their fucking name. 
[02:15:30]  I'm saying from...  If you say comics from the opening of the show, we would technically want a piece of that.  What's that?  I would never do that to you.  No, because...  How about this?  When people say...  When people do fucking half-hour specials on Comedy Central, they go, uh, from Comedy Central,  uh, uh, uh...  You can tell yourself whatever you want.  Using it to sell the show is different than...  Yeah, you're using it to sell the show.  It's the same as every...  If you're marketing it as the comics from Opie and Anthony, that could mean we would get  a taste.  Every club markets your credits.  Every club markets your credits.  If you're going into a club and they're going to...  I understand it. 
[02:16:00]  But if the name...  Kim Norton from Louis C...  What was that show that you guys did?  Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie.  I understand that.  Okay, you're using the name to market.  But that's not the...  I'm coming in as Jim Norton.  I'm not saying...  Okay, then we're coming in.  Hold on.  Rich Boss from The Last Comic Standing.  Seriously, you're...  Are you an...  He's gone.  Rich, yeah, because he knew you were getting yourself.  All right, let me go to Matty and run on.  As Rich...  Hold on, Rich.  One for you.  This guy is on your side.  Go ahead, Matty.  Here we go.  Go ahead, Matty.  Hey, first of all, foremost yesterday, phenomenal show.  Jay, you had me cracking up with that monkey story.  I mean, you are a phenomenal talent. 
[02:16:30]  But, man, you are so fast and so clever.  You have this way of just calming it over.  And before someone can even respond to you, you're on to the next thing.  You take over the show.  There's only one other man I've ever heard in the history of ONA that could take over  the show, and that's DICE.  And, man, you take over, man.  And I understand O brings you in, whoever.  Please just give them some breathing space to let us...  No, I disagree.  I agree.  Not as I talk over him. 
[02:17:00]  I agree with the guy.  The one thing I want to change about myself for the last 15 years is I fucking talk too  much.  No, Matt, I got to say, man, I mean, the run we've had with Jay the last week and a half  has been great.  It really has been great.  Is he a lawyer, this guy?  No, unfortunately not.  Did he sound like a lawyer?  Jay, you can't agree with that.  It's been great.  It's been a great run.  Listen, Rich.  You've seen...  Voss' last tweet is, I'm at the library with Kidd.  Too fucking quiet in here.  Why would you tweet that?  Exactly.  Spelled L-I-B-E-R-R-Y. 
[02:17:30]  Library.  I spelled two T-O.  That's his favorite cereal.  Library.  Why do you go to the library?  I took my daughter there, my three and a half year old.  For what?  You can get that on the internet.  You fucking idiot.  She can't play games and run around on the internet.  You shouldn't run around the library.  What do you do with the library?  They have fucking...  I like how you're getting shit for going to a place.  Like, you get shit for being stupid, and then you go to the library, and you get shit for  going to a place.  Dude, you're a homeless guy.  What are you doing with fucking books and shit, man?  Libraries are for homeless people at this point.  No one really goes.  Not where I live.  Yeah, they do.  So what do they do at the library? 
[02:18:00]  They have readings.  They have activities for kids.  They have all different stuff.  The other night, we went to a soup tasting thing.  You went to a soup tasting?  It was Bonnie's idea.  It's soup.  You went to a soup drool.  You fucking assholes went and tasted soup.  It was Bonnie's idea.  Why don't you make your own?  Because there was five different, five or six restaurants from our hometown.  What?  They had soup tasting.  Name the soups.  It was something to do.  Hold on.  Name the soups.  I don't fucking remember the soup.  You don't remember the soups?  There was fucking a Polish soup from the Polish restaurants. 
[02:18:30]  You had to sit there and go, ooh, this one's really good.  You can really taste the vegetables.  It was like three weeks ago.  But it was something to do, me and Bonnie, as a husband, wife, and a baby, to go and hang  out in our town and do something nice.  It was a Monday or Tuesday night.  Your marriage sucks.  Why do you resent Bonnie?  You're going to soup tastings.  What the fuck?  Soup tasting is horrible.  I know.  We didn't know that until we went.  You know I love you.  I try to support you, but soup tasting, I can't get behind.  You should be tasting it through a hole in a booth.  They should have your soup. 
[02:19:00]  Did he have crackers along with it?  Oh, yeah.  Oysterettes.  He was zilch.  Oysterettes.  Yes.  With the New England.  You take your kid to the library.  That's what you do.  My library's fine.  Is this what I have to do soon?  Yes.  Take him to a library?  Well, yeah.  How did you know which building it was?  I'm having trouble syncing my fucking new iPad, by the way, to my Kindle.  Not good.  I can't get my books on my new iPad.  I'm out of my mind about it.  That's not good.  Do you have a Kindle on your iPad? 
[02:19:30]  Isn't there a Kindle app?  Oh, fuck for.  Shouldn't that be easy?  Why would I read a fucking book on my iPad?  It's all doable.  I stopped reading five years when I met Bonnie.  I used to read all the time.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I got all my books at home.  I read.  I keep them.  So why don't you fucking...  If you just want to prove to yourself that you've read...  Yes.  Why don't you read it on your iPad?  It's great.  It's so light.  You can have fucking 50 books on it.  I'd rather watch a movie.  You want to do an O&A...  Comics of O&A tour?  I'll take a piece of that.  I already did it.  We did it... 
[02:20:00]  The virus show was...  What happened to the other tour you were talking about?  What happened to that one?  Which one?  The fucking Car Crash Comedy Tour.  We're trying, but we can't get these dummies on the same page.  You mean us?  No, the real dummies.  We're dumb, but they're...  The suit dummies.  Well, how hard is it to put it together?  You would think it would be easy, but...  And we don't want to step on Jimmy's toes.  Jimmy's doing his thing right now.  After Jimmy's done, we might do a thing.  It's amazing when you book a theater.  Like, the amount of money you have to put out for, like, a fucking stagehand.  Expenses.  To stand there and watch you do your fucking show.  Like, are you fucking serious? 
[02:20:30]  They go, hey, it's Union.  Fucking, that's a stage show.  You need four guys in the room with the curtain.  You're like, but I don't use...  Nothing's moving.  The expenses are killing the guys down the hall.  They can't justify it.  Yeah, the theater expenses are disgusting.  That's sad.  That's why he'll do two shows, because there's less expenses.  I think a car crash comedy, a short run with that would be fun in a few cities.  I think we'd have a good time with that.  You can do it in comedy clubs, I guess.  So you don't have to do it in a theater.  You can do it in a theater at a college where you don't have to pay the union.  We're going to try to figure it out for you, Rich, so you get a few more bucks in your pocket.  College theaters.  I like all the calls that are anti-me. 
[02:21:00]  Where?  Why?  Where do you want me to go?  I'll go in.  You want an intervention on Jay?  John, this guy lives in Staten Island.  Let's go to John in Staten Island.  John.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  Welcome aboard, John.  How long have you been listening to the show?  First time, long time.  First time, huh?  Quack, quack.  I'll take your thoughts off the air.  Quack, quack.  Whoa, whoa.  Hit from all angles.  Quack, quack.  Quack, pork chop.  So, Voss and Jimmy could probably help me out with this one.  Wait, say again?  Jay. 
[02:21:30]  Jay's been a little up to these.  He's been talking over people.  And Voss and Jimmy can probably notice the signs that somebody has fallen off the wagon.  The references to being on mushrooms yesterday, he mentioned it about four times.  I think you're wrong, John.  No, he's right.  I'm fucking, I'm going back to you.  I think you want to know us, Jay.  You're off the rails.  Well, here's the thing.  I'm going back to the program tonight because I'm obviously a fucking drunk.  I wasn't here yesterday, but I didn't even think Jay Moore was in recovery. 
[02:22:00]  Even if he quit.  Some people stop and not in recovery and might dabble.  And that's okay if that's what they do.  If you knew how dumb you looked with that fucking head fall on your head like that.  Huh?  Tweet it, Jimmy.  Please.  Can we tweet this?  You did it again.  Huh?  I know.  I like that.  Okay, huh?  So.  Hold on, hold on.  That's the exact picture we leave on our door.  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy, we've already done it.  Yeah, I know.  Oh.  You know what's interesting to me anyway is I get like if I do a show and then I hit Twitter 
[02:22:30]  afterwards, which is like pathetic because we do shows and you go on Twitter to go,  did I do good, everyone?  And then people go, he was obviously inebriated.  Like that's.  They said that.  People say that about me all the time.  And I don't know what.  Not like in clubs, but if I do like.  Because your eyes are too close together.  You know what?  I got to talk like Greg Hughes again here.  Jay's never been more focused.  Hasn't been this focused.  But wait a second.  You're on the show.  It's been a great run. 
[02:23:00]  I don't want people to fucking tear this one down too.  You're not sober.  Are you sober, sober or like, I don't know.  I don't know.  I smoke grass once in a while.  Okay.  So then why would they say.  I've quit everything else.  Okay.  But I haven't smoked grass since.  I don't remember the last time I did.  So I guess.  How long have you been smoking the grass?  Well, I stopped.  It's slowing down.  When I split custody of my son, I stopped in case she said, well, drug test them because  you can say anything you want.  So I stopped just in case like that because that'll come out of nowhere. 
[02:23:30]  Unprompted.  And we're on the adoption waiting list.  So I'm not going to.  I thought you were doing the ball surgery.  We were doing all of it.  We're going to adopt for gardens.  We're trying everything.  Wait, wait.  I would adopt.  You have custody of your son?  We split it.  Oh, yeah.  We'll split it.  Is that a nightmare?  Wait.  Is this on Twitter?  What's that?  I mean the.  Yeah.  Seeing the.  Wait.  It's business.  Email.  Oh, you get it down to business.  You drop them off at school.  I'll pick them up at school.  So it's just a business.  That's it.  Do you get along with your ex-wife?  Some people can't get to the business area. 
[02:24:00]  Oh.  See, me and my ex-wife got along great after.  How does Bonnie get along with her?  Great.  You ever heard this one?  Hold on.  No, no, no.  I'll slow you down again.  His ex-wife babysits the kid.  How weird is that?  Do you ever think about going in there and giving her a fucking one for old time session?  To get hard with Bonnie, I think it killed me.  That's why.  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian.  How do you know these fucking buttons? 
[02:24:30]  I don't know them.  He's looking out.  It's a magic fucking thing I have.  He's completely looking out.  No, my wife.  I was living two miles from my ex-wife.  But she just moved to North Carolina.  Is she hot, your ex-wife?  She's sexy.  It's all right.  She's hotter than Bonnie.  Norton fucked her.  What?  Norton fucked my ex-wife.  Well.  Did he really?  I found Dangerfield matches at my ex-wife.  Oh, this is.  I forgot.  This is the other story, Jay.  He's convinced that Jimmy fucked his wife.  I tried to divorce.  I was annoyed at first that he thought that.  But then I'm just like, I kind of hope he does think that because I know it bothers him.  I hope he did.  Why do you think that? 
[02:25:00]  You and Florentine split her in half.  Rich, why do you think that?  I knew Florentine was there because I found a long blonde hair.  Because when we were going to her.  Are you chewing gum again?  No.  Open your mouth.  Stop chewing the gum, you addict.  Why would you say no?  He just threw the other piece at me.  People hear it, dude.  It's fucking dry.  It's now it's in my junk.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Are you chewing the gum because you want a cigarette or are you just chewing a gum because  it's just a habit, like how some people bite their nails?  I'm addicted to the nicotine.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm addicted.  I don't dabble.  I do remember the last time I did it, which was a minute ago. 
[02:25:30]  I love it.  I love it.  Sometimes you can fall asleep with it like this.  You fall asleep.  You wake up, you still have it, and you get some good flavor, and then you go back to bed.  I think you're some more flavor.  You are a fucking addict.  Did you ever smoke?  Did you ever smoke?  I did.  Did you quit?  Yep.  You know how I quit?  Whenever I wanted a cigarette, I dropped down.  I did 15 diamond push-ups.  Dude.  Did you really?  Wait, is this a joke or real?  Nope.  I needed something.  You must have quit a while ago. 
[02:26:00]  I quit in Vegas when we were doing...  Yeah, because you want to come feel these fucking pipes, Mr. Fucking Skinny Tattoo Arms?  Those pipes?  Is that what they are?  Yeah.  You've got to see them without a shirt on.  Are you kidding me?  There's no fucking joke here?  Without a shirt on, yeah.  Let me see your pipes.  Let me see.  Come touch them.  Come over here.  Come around, Jimmy.  It's okay to touch people.  You just can't...  What are you doing?  Hopefully dying.  E-Rock, you did it too? 
[02:26:30]  I mean, sorry.  Danny, sorry.  You needed something to combat those cravings, because they're just too intense.  It's all you could think about.  So I just kind of...  I came up...  I just figured if I...  Every time I feel like I want one, I'll just go down and do 10 push-ups.  Like, almost no matter where I am.  Diamonds, brother.  That's funny, because you...  And after a few...  Dude, a few weeks...  Weeks, days, you don't even want to think about smoking, because your arms are...  But that helps.  I was going to 12-step meetings, and before the meetings, everybody would get down and do push-ups.  Nothing. 
[02:27:00]  Hello, everybody.  What?  Shucky-ducky, crack-crack.  Hamburger.  That joke was terrible.  Remember?  I used to work with those guys.  Hamburger.  Do you know Shucky-ducky?  I worked with them once.  Yeah, Rich, you're chewing into the mic.  It's driving me nuts.  I throw that out.  You got to stop.  Hold on.  You remember the movie Magic?  Thank you, buddy.  Hold on.  Remember the movie Magic?  Yes.  How long do you think he could go without putting another fucking piece of gum in his mouth?  I don't know.  Remember in Magic where, you know, he had to put the puppet down? 
[02:27:30]  It was that intense scene where he-  Fats.  I don't know if he lasted a minute.  He had to grab it.  I want to see how long it takes this fucking guy to go without putting another piece in.  Oh, all right.  It's not because you chew it into the mic.  Now this has turned into a game show.  Because I-  Or a game show.  So I had saliva back there.  Rich, can you go 15 minutes without a piece of gum in your mouth?  Easily.  Okay, good.  All right, we'll see.  Oh, no way.  And just go back to the show, and we'll see what happens.  So yeah, I quit smoking.  Yeah.  But the hardest thing to quit was chewing tobacco.  Because you can do it anywhere. 
[02:28:00]  You can do it on an airplane.  You can do it on a show.  I mean, I was just sitting here with a big water garbage in my mouth.  Oh, just dump it.  It's called your act.  Good.  You know-  Shucky-ducky.  Drack, drack.  You knew Shucky-ducky?  I knew them all, man.  What's with all of them?  Did you know Chicken?  No, I never met that guy.  I never met him.  I know.  Is there a Chicken guy?  There was.  He was.  What was his deal?  He wasn't.  What was his deal, Jim?  Why do you wear your headphones like that?  Because it hurts my ear this ear.  Why that ear?  But, like, I wear it behind like that, but I don't wear it. 
[02:28:30]  I only have one ear covered.  I hate having both ears covered.  I never do.  Let me try this.  No, it's off my ear.  This is weird.  It's behind my ear.  I can't do that.  Let's all do it.  It's nice.  Does it get a nice breeze in there?  Yeah, it feels good.  You get some air on your ear.  The sound quality of this drives me nuts.  Yeah, I hate talking into these mics.  No, but I hate having my ear.  I like real sound.  I fucking hate doing radio.  It's like I just did a Whippet.  All right, Jay Moore is clearly on drugs with the Whippet reference. 
[02:29:00]  Fucking doltz.  It's my favorite Devo song.  All right, should we break then?  No, this is going fine.  You need a piece of gum, don't you?  You got one in your mouth?  No.  Did you guys talk about Mitt?  Who?  Romney.  He's going to do an exploratory committee.  To see if he could be the president?  Like, have some fucking balls.  Just do it.  Obama, suck my fucking Mormon cock.  I'm in.  2012, Wu-Tang, forever.  Like, just fucking call your shot.  Get Larry Merchant to do it for you.  I like that guy. 
[02:29:30]  Do a boxing thing.  Mitt Romney's a man.  I love fucking Mitt Romney, but this exploratory committee.  Like, what?  They all do it.  They all do it.  Like, you know what's great?  The second you lose in fucking 2008, go, fuck that shit.  I'm coming back.  Four years, I'm fucking you up, bitch.  Like in high school, like a bully beatdown.  Just go, I'll see you in four years, bitch.  And then go, all right.  Well, we know he's in.  Well, he lost to McCain.  He didn't even lose to fucking Obama.  Okay?  He didn't even get to fucking front.  It was too early for him. 
[02:30:00]  This is his time.  Jay's kind of right.  If you're fucking go, you gotta fucking go, I'm in.  It shows me fucking dumb TV show has to focus group for us.  I hate the exploratory thing.  I think Jay's on or something.  It shows me that you're not sure how well you will do.  Exactly.  In which point, you got no fucking business being in there.  Exactly.  Because if you want the job, you shouldn't give a shit how you would do.  You should be driven by the fact that you know you could right the ship.  And if people don't vote for me, then I don't know what to fucking tell you.  The people, they knew.  The judges, they didn't know.  Who knew what they knew?  Who's going to be the front line?  Man, Kim, go first. 
[02:30:30]  Don't get out of the fucking ring.  You won.  Tell me why we had to come to Cleveland for you to get beat by a fucking movie on.  Why?  Don't get out of the ring.  This fucking serial killer just got fucking bigger, man.  CNN is live.  There's a skull found on Long Island.  No, they found ten bodies, Jay.  There's a serial killer.  I mean, everyone knows this area of Long Island.  Fucking creepy.  Ocean Parkway.  Holy shit.  He's got a type.  He's up to ten.  Craig List hookers.  Yeah, but there was a baby.  There was a kid.  There was a kid, too. 
[02:31:00]  They found a kid?  Yes.  Yeah, a five-year-old.  When?  I guess yesterday, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was one of the two they found?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  So there goes his comfort zone and his pattern.  Oh, fuck.  I bet you that the kid was with the mother.  That's probably why.  That was probably one of...  Yeah, they said that the remains were found close to an adult.  So what?  The hookers bring the kids sometimes?  Not that I know, but he may have went to her.  He did in the deer hunter.  Yeah?  No, not with the kid in the room.  No, man.  Not with the kid.  And they're still trying to find the one girl. 
[02:31:30]  So that means it's at least 11.  I like this fucking dolt on the news that's holding up the missing poster on television.  Led to the beginning of this entire investigation.  Carol?  I'm just curious, Alan.  How remote is that area?  I mean, 10 bodies found?  It is tremendously remote.  I mean, if you had to think of a place to jump bodies, this is actually a terribly desolate  stretch of Barrier Island.  Right now, I'm standing at Jones Beach. 
[02:32:00]  Alan, turn off is awful.  You know how wind is blowing on the beach in the New York area?  I'm watching east of me for 15 miles straight.  There's a highway that just extends very far.  Very few people go there.  Just a few hundred people live in beachside homes around here.  You know how busy Ocean Parkway is?  What is he talking about?  Fucking Danny knows.  Ocean Parkway is a busy fucking road.  It can be.  It can be.  You know, in spring and summer and stuff.  Like winter.  It can be desolate.  I know what he's talking about. 
[02:32:30]  It's obviously a person that knows that area very well.  Very well.  It's a comfort zone.  It's going to be a fucking someone that works for the park system or a cop.  It could be ex-law enforcement.  Because if you're pulled over, it's so obvious that why are you pulled over in that stretch?  They're going to fucking investigate.  And that's a tough place to bring a body to if you had to do that.  I don't know what's going on over here, so I'm just going to talk to you.  His headphones.  It's all right.  Rick just popped off.  He popped off his head.  It popped off his head. 
[02:33:00]  Like if you put a rubber band on your head, it would explode up.  He's got his headphones.  If you were doing Ray Romano in the 80s.  You could do it.  Crack, crack.  Don't you remember that, Kirk?  That's terrific.  Why would you be doing that in Salt Lake this weekend?  Look, I'm going to tell you who the serial killer is.  It's a guy that works for the park system or a cop.  Simple as that.  Because you can't just pull over to the side of the road without people going,  what the fuck is that guy doing just on the side of the road?  And the road's busy enough where that would happen. 
[02:33:30]  Might be very late.  Might be very late.  Might be at 4 a.m. or 4.03.  There's always people there.  People, let's just say, people go there to fucking have sex in cars and stuff,  and the cops are always stopping people.  Always.  You can't park a car in the middle of the night there without someone knowing.  And you can't do it basically during the day because there's a lot of traffic.  It's an inside guy.  I'm telling you.  He's obviously been doing it for a while.  He probably hasn't dumped there in a while.  Obviously now he'll dump somewhere else. 
[02:34:00]  It's someone that really does know that area and knows when to, well, I mean,  if it's like a cop car or something on the side of the fucking...  You've got a lot of people wanting to defend you, Richard.  On what?  On the fucking telephones.  Let me say hi to this guy along the way.  This is great when the subject matter says, Voss had a great joke about leaving a load.  Oh, I know.  Nothing says class.  Hey, Jay.  Yeah, I saw Voss on that tour.  They didn't really rip you off, but he did have this one great line about leaving a map 
[02:34:30]  of Hawaii on a chick's stomach.  Good.  What was this?  Yeah.  Me?  Yeah, Voss did that.  No.  I never said that in my life.  Thank you, but I never said it.  It's probably something else.  Where?  What tour?  I wrote that!  What tour?  Okay, you're all right.  All right.  I didn't really rip you off.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup.  Oh, my chest.  Yeah.  Voss, you just have brought the laughs today. 
[02:35:00]  They're going to love you in Salt Lake.  Wise Guys Comedy Club.  We don't have to promote this.  It's 80 people sold out, right?  What's that?  Show me with your tiny finger.  I won't say it out loud.  Show me with your finger.  You're going to think it's half.  I already did that.  And he told me, no, I'm a big deal.  I have to promote something.  Do they pay for your plane?  Yeah.  After I buy outs.  Who's the guy that called as rich?  That was tremendous shit.  Oh, Bob. 
[02:35:30]  De Bono.  Is he around?  I would love to hear him today.  They did Luis Ferranda.  I can't do tour deals, Jimmy.  It'll kill me.  His kid's good.  Oh, God.  Where's Linda Smith?  My God, when you need her.  Jimmy, it's to you.  I have the Antisocial Comedy.  Just go to antisocialcomedy.com.  We have dates on sale now in Las Vegas, D.C.  in the opening night of the Chicago Comedy Festival.  Connecticut is sold out, and they will sell out as well.  Nice.  I'm going to fucking hit some.  I'm at Gotham tonight.  That will not sell out.  Why?  Because it's in Chelsea with the gay boys. 
[02:36:00]  It's half slice.  It's also Tuesday.  It's tough.  Tuesday's tough.  Why are you not here this weekend?  Just a week?  I'm in Borgata Saturday.  It's a $25 ticket, though, tonight.  It's not...  Or $20?  It's, you know...  Can I get a room at the Borgata?  I'm going.  Are you sold out in the Borgata?  Let's go.  I doubt it.  Then you should be plugging in.  You should be plugging in.  Borgata.  I'm at the Borgata Theater.  Fuck Gotham.  Saturday.  Borgata Theater.  Well, they're different markets.  I mean, if you're in New York or to Gotham...  Nah, we like the Gotham people.  If you're in...  The Borgata's the best hotel in the country. 
[02:36:30]  Except for the guy that yelled at me when I walked in with a hat, because I didn't want  to disturb Jay's fucking show, and the guy almost threw me out.  For wearing a hat?  Did you do snow climbing?  You can't wear hats in Gotham?  Nope.  Snow climbing.  And the guy, the security guard, I was like, okay.  But he was fucking pissed, and I almost...  I never told you this.  I almost got thrown out.  Because I wore a hat.  He was really fucking upset.  Where?  And then the owner apologized.  In a casino?  Jesus Christ.  At the Borgata?  At the Borgata?  Yes.  Iraq just hit...  Yes.  What do you do? 
[02:37:00]  Forget it.  I was trying to hear.  What happens?  You're five feet away from me.  No fucking way.  Yes.  In a 100-seat room.  I'm telling you.  What do you got?  What number?  Don't say it on the air.  No.  What a jacket.  I'll tell you off the air.  I'll tell you off the air.  Yeah?  No way.  That's what I said.  No way.  I'm telling you why I will.  You're pumping your numbers up.  I'm telling you why I will.  I know exactly...  Give me a pen.  All right.  Right here.  No.  No fucking...  I would never do that.  Thurman Munson.  I wouldn't do that at home for that. 
[02:37:30]  I wouldn't do...  What the fuck kind of person?  I would.  I forgot Thurman's number.  No.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's you right there.  Guarantee I'm not.  I'll show you the email.  I believe him.  I can fucking hear your flame gargling around in your own throat.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take it away.  What's in his mouth?  You fucking faggot prick.  It's in my mouth the whole time, you fucking homos.  How long ago did he put the gum back there?  He totally got his chicken.  That's what an actor I am.  You can't tell.  Oh, there's no gum?  No, it's in his mouth.  He never spit out the face.  He fucking fagged spitting it.  He fagged spitting it out.  He fagged spitting it out.  What a fucking cunt. 
[02:38:00]  That's nice.  That's really nice.  Now we're doing British radio.  You just...  I don't even like that word.  You forced me to say it.  Why aren't you wearing underwear?  What are you doing now?  Why aren't you doing underwear?  Why aren't you wearing underwear?  That's what he does when he can't think of the word that he needs.  He's punching his stomach.  All the thing comes out.  All right, we've seen your asshole.  It doesn't matter.  We've seen her.  You know what?  What's more humiliating?  I showed it to Bonnie and she almost threw up.  She was in the kitchen. 
[02:38:30]  She came around.  Yeah, it's an oral medium.  You're going to have to fucking figure out the mic.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to break.  Jay Moore, Bregada.  This weekend.  And Jim Norton gave all the dates and maybe...  Antisocialcomedy.com.  That's a crazy-ass great show you put together.  Yeah.  Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion 3 Show.  Opinion 3.  Oh, boy. 
[02:39:00]  We got Ozzy info, obviously.  That's why we're playing this.  I'm guessing it's on the text, though.  There's two things.  Ozzy received a star in the Walk of Fame nine years ago.  Whatever.  And he owes money.  The Osborne's owe 1.7.  Wow.  Wow.  How does that happen?  Probably just bad bookkeeping.  Sharon said it was her fault.  Yeah, not right off.  Nothing.  It's Trinko Jake.  It's ginger ale.  50, it's 700,000 for one year and a million for the next year. 
[02:39:30]  They'll take care of it.  That's like free shows at the Meadowlands.  That's nothing.  It's nothing.  Knock it right off.  Knock it right off.  I like all these calls about Rich being a fucking FBI profiler.  It's great.  I don't want to tell you to fucking do your own show.  We've been doing less calls, but we could go to Brooklyn.  Tony!  I love this.  Tony!  Hello?  Just say hi, everybody on the phone.  Thanks, Jay Morse.  Sorry.  You're fucking...  Hello?  Tony, you fuck. 
[02:40:00]  He's not there.  The guy from Brooklyn.  He's not there.  Yeah, but it's a good call.  Since Voss is an FBI profiler, what is his opinion on this serial killer?  What is your opinion?  Well, it's a lot of childhood anger.  He probably had a speech impediment, and he probably came from a broken home, and his  mother was very overpowering or overbearing, and he's, you know, transforming his aggression  that he...  Transferring.  Did he get...  Transferring. 
[02:40:30]  No, I like...  Transforming.  He's transforming.  Transferring.  No, transforming.  Forming, furring, whatever.  I love the whatever.  Like, it's not that big of a deal.  And, you know, and he's getting back with his mom.  It's a lot of them do it that way.  Have you gotten back with your mom?  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  Did you tell her that you were mad at her?  Oh, no.  How did I get back with my mom?  I told her I loved her, and that's how you let things go.  Attaboy.  You and your mom had a problem?  A lot of...  Yeah.  Me. 
[02:41:00]  Both of you.  You know, you know...  You didn't get any affection.  You didn't come from a broken home.  No.  No.  No.  All the walls were fine.  Chip.  Goddamn, Chip.  You kill me.  Bobby Kelly and you should go out together.  He's too stupid.  You should have been here when Ricky Gervais mistook Jimmy for Bobby Kelly.  That was a sad moment.  It really was.  Because I saw you at the Comedy Cellar, and I was laughing because Louie said something  in my ear, and I laughed so hard it was distracting.  No, I was actually glad that he mixed this up there because that's embarrassing. 
[02:41:30]  Because Bob Kelly thought that he made Ricky Gervais laugh, and it was because Louie C.D.  was for something.  Ricky's here.  But I thought Ricky knew you.  Didn't he put you in a movie?  No.  Oh, no.  That's Kevin.  Yeah.  No, he doesn't.  We've interviewed him before.  He knows me, but he mixed me up with that fucking...  Like he knows you from the Cellar and stuff?  Just through Louie, I think.  And I'm sure he's seen Lucky Louie. 
[02:42:00]  What was Louie doing on his computer during that interview?  Probably looking at stuff that he had shot.  He's shooting a series.  Yeah.  And he's that overwhelmed with work that he...  Dude, he edits.  He does everything himself.  Wow.  Yeah, he does it all.  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  I'm a nincompoop on the computer.  Emails only.  People are like, did you get it?  I'm like, I don't have a fucking printer in my house.  Fucking drop it in the mailbox like Paulie and Goodfellas.  Come by.  Mailbox?  What's that?  People go, I sent you all your flight information.  I go, well, then I don't have my flight information because it's in my computer. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  Wait, you don't get it through emails and stuff?  I get it, but I don't have a printer in my house, and I don't know.  How do you have a printer?  Because I'm a fucking stooge.  Well, you just do it on your phone.  Get a printer in your house.  I can get...  Yeah, I get stuff on my phone, but then I forget.  I like writing stuff and printing it, and you've got to have a printer.  You really do.  I love having a printer.  You need a printer.  I take great pride in it.  Now, are you more pro-printer or more pro-easy-pair?  Oh my God, we're not going to do this on this show.  What?  What?  Am I more pro-printer or pro-easy-pair?  I have a printer. 
[02:43:00]  I'm for both.  He tells you all the things you have to get in life  that makes his life easier.  Yes, they make everyone's life easier.  That's not true.  Easy pass?  It might not.  You don't know.  Who?  How?  How?  Because maybe if you don't want to be tracked.  He doesn't have it.  To be tracked.  You don't want to be tracked?  You're not that important.  They're not going to...  I'm not saying you're saying some people...  Do you have credit cards, Profiler?  Yes, I do.  So they fucking track you there?  Everywhere.  All they got to do is go fucking from empty comedy club to empty comedy club. 
[02:43:30]  To Long Island.  What'd you say?  All they got to do is go from empty comedy club to empty comedy club.  That was fantastic.  Very good.  Very good.  Chris, no one is a pro-printer.  Ooh, threw the gum away.  Yeah, you did.  How could you not?  You were an inch away from the cup.  Oh, did you see mine and Rich's hands together?  Do it again, Rich.  Come on, Rich.  Put your little turtle feet hands up.  Turtle pets, too.  Yeah, put those turtle...  Your best line is visiting...  Look how funny. 
[02:44:00]  No, just line them up for real.  Line it up.  Line it up.  Oh, what a child.  He's got a gambling habit.  What?  Childhood.  What's his name?  Cookie jar.  Cookie jar.  When we were...  He's got a gambling problem.  Me and Rich Voss were at the Continental Hotel watching Cookie Jar, the lounge singer.  And Bruce Smirnoff.  Me, Rich, and Bruce Smirnoff.  And Rich goes to the craps table and throws all his fucking money away.  Comes back to the craps table and goes, could you loan me $100? 
[02:44:30]  And I go, sure.  And then he goes to the craps table and he comes back.  It's the same song.  And he comes back.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking...  He just put $100.  Shicks the hard way.  And he loses it again.  And the singer's on stage.  And he leaves.  A three trip.  And now, at this point, I don't want him to pay me back.  I just want to feed this fucking addiction and watch it in front of my eyes.  And see where it goes.  That's my entertainment for the night.  Yeah.  So I'm like 600 into his fucking habit.  It's the same song.  If you don't know me by now... 
[02:45:00]  Handcuff him to the chair.  He's got a fucking sickness.  You'll never have a...  The guy actually fucking yelled that at Voss from the stage.  Holy shit.  Remember Brandy?  You'll never...  Yeah, Voss had some seven that he was fucking parading around Vegas.  She was definitely a nine.  A seven.  A Voss seven is a fucking everyone else nine and a half.  That's good for me.  I'm saying it's a bell curve how you judge women.  Like, we all are surprised that you married somebody who's beautiful and talented as Bonnie. 
[02:45:30]  I always had hot girls in my fucking life.  Because you had coke.  No, after.  I've had...  I got a resume.  Because they thought you had coke.  No, you fucking moron.  Why do I sound like Colin?  Shut your face.  I have pictures of home of the hottest fucking girls.  That's fucking good.  That's good for marriage.  That's it.  I keep them hidden in the basement, dummy.  I'm going to go down there to fucking spank one out.  Yeah.  I guess Bonnie doesn't listen to the show.  Do you really go to the basement and check out old fucking photographs?  You're a serial killer, man. 
[02:46:00]  What are you keeping?  A fucking chock full of nuts?  Fucking canned zilch?  That's where you put your photos in.  That's where you put the 8x10s.  I got them in a fucking briefcase.  A briefcase?  A briefcase?  Oh, you fucking...  Yeah, that's...  That's how old it is.  She'll never think they'll look there.  Yeah, exactly.  A briefcase in the basement with cum stains on it.  Yeah, a briefcase is way more normal than a fucking coffee can.  Rich says there's nothing under here but a bunch of papers.  What does Bonnie think in the briefcase?  Exactly. 
[02:46:30]  You're a young lawyer.  You actually said that.  You had the serial...  You said the serial killer.  I picture you on a golf course going, well, the serial killer has a speech impediment.  I don't talk like that.  Only with a couple letters.  You're fucking up every letter.  H?  Yeah, and S.  Say sushi.  No, it's S.  We just said...  This is what we did on Last Comic Standing.  To make me happy, you said I had sushi in church Tuesday.  I can say it perfectly.  All right.  And try it.  I had sushi. 
[02:47:00]  Hold on.  It's not Sue.  I had sushi.  Sue?  It's your jawbone.  Sushi in church on Tuesday.  It's your fucking game.  I don't play that shit.  If I was crippled...  What do you mean?  If I had like a fucking no legs, you would have said get up and dance.  Yeah, we would.  I'm great with that.  You'd be just as tall as you are now.  My hands against your hands looks like we're fucking...  Exactly.  Like Father Sunday.  Like he's molesting him. 
[02:47:30]  You have bigger hands.  Say the sushi again.  No, enough already.  Say church.  No.  What do you mean no?  What else are we going to do?  What else are we going to do?  Come on guys, lay off.  Go to the tape.  We lost the show hours ago.  What else are we going to do?  Look at the game.  Hours.  Hours.  Do the church thing.  More.  Do it for fucking Jay Morris.  There you go.  It was perfect.  Love it.  But I say a couple of bad letters.  I don't say every word like that.  No, I know you don't.  Do you really have a briefcase with pictures in it?  Of old girlfriends?  Of old girlfriends?  It's so fucked up.  It's a hard briefcase. 
[02:48:00]  You don't remember?  Does Bonnie know that you have it?  You can't just do the Spanx bubble?  Did you hear the telltale click of it opening at fucking two in the morning?  Tuk, tuk.  Is there a lock on it?  You need the combination?  No.  Don't touch me, you freak.  It's not because he's a freak.  It's because we all know you get really uncomfortable.  Who wants to be?  There's too many uncomfortable things that go on in here.  What?  I love you.  I love you.  That love thing.  I love you.  We don't say I love you.  They say it all the time.  Where are you?  When was the last time we said that? 
[02:48:30]  Somebody called.  I love you guys.  I love you.  Yeah, that's uncomfortable when people express their admiration.  It's common speak.  See, I don't say it like that.  Yes, you do.  Because you never heard it.  Say admiration.  Yes, you do.  Give me the line because you've never heard it.  It's a great line, Rich.  I can't believe she got knocked off last week.  Say admiration.  Hey, did you guys have-  Wait, you watch American Idol?  Yeah.  You know Pia?  I just know because they're talking about- 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I can't-  I know Anamana Pia.  Oh, shit.  Did you guys have Trump on?  His son.  He's a great guy, actually.  We had a good time.  No one.  Trump Jr. likes.  He's a good guy for a billionaire son, yeah.  There's two of them.  There's two kids.  Yeah, it was Don Jr.  Don Jr.  It's like the bosses, not the blonde-haired.  The other one.  The blonde-haired, uh, learned the golf courses.  What?  I'm being completely serious.  I can't fucking believe your daughter's 18 years old.  I'm 18 and 20.  I have a 20-year-old, too.  Wow.  We were in the Poconos. 
[02:49:30]  They were like, fuck it.  Oh, we're playing fucking good old days now.  I apologize.  Where were we in the Poconos?  You and I did some gig together in the Poconos.  Yeah.  It was like, your kids were like six and eight.  It was great.  Yeah, we did a gig in the Poconos?  Remember your headlining Mount Harry Lodge?  He was.  That was two weeks ago.  He was.  They were there.  Oh, oh, that was the weekend my fucking wife was leaving me.  That's the weekend.  Oh, I fucking, that was, oh, that was OJ weekend.  Why are these black guys walking through like, yo, that's mad crazy in there, son.  They just did shade 45. 
[02:50:00]  But they pointed in here like, that's Jim Norton's.  No, they didn't.  Yes, they did.  Well, let's go get them.  Who are they?  If it's black people, I'm the one who's getting recognized.  Will you talk about the wife?  Exactly.  She left you that weekend when you were doing the Poconos with Jay Moore?  That was my ex-wife.  Yeah, I think that was OJ weekend.  Where can we find a photo of your ex-wife?  Huh?  She's pretty.  What's going on?  Oh, the touching?  Where can we find a photo of your ex-wife?  Do you have one? 
[02:50:30]  No.  Why not?  Is that in the briefcase?  Is that in the briefcase?  I'm in the briefcase.  Is it in the briefcase?  Has Bonnie ever caught you masturbating?  Be honest.  No.  My wife caught me masturbating.  Really?  Yep.  You know what she said to me?  What?  She said, is that something you need to do?  We were at a hotel, and we had already had sex, and she went to sleep, and then I was watching  a porno.  Did I tell this already?  Yeah.  It's okay.  Tell it again for Rich.  Oh, new audience.  And then, so she was asleep, and so I didn't want to wake her up, so I went in the room, 
[02:51:00]  and I put on a movie on the pay-per-view, and I jerked off.  And then she saw me, but she didn't tell me.  And it was like three weeks later, we're in the car, driving to Vegas.  We're in the middle of the desert.  And she goes, when you masturbate, is that something you need to do?  And I was like, what?  And she goes, you know, like porno and stuff, is that what you need to do?  And I'm like, I act like I had no idea what she was talking about.  She goes, okay, well, just so you know, I'm kind of a sure thing.  Like, you can wake me up.  And I was like, oh, okay.  So then porno goes out the window.  I was masturbating a couple weeks ago, and I talk about this, and I didn't want to, but 
[02:51:30]  I did.  And I fucking, I wasn't even hard.  I was semi-hard, and I came.  I didn't know that to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can that happen?  Yes.  For 30 years, I've been doing that.  No, it can't.  You just said it happened.  Well, I mean, what do you think your dick is?  You answered your whole question.  You answered your whole question.  It's amazing.  Under the spirit of 76.  76, your cock is different than any other cock on the planet.  It most certainly is.  Did he actually say, can that happen?  No, I mean, you know what I mean.  Said it happened.  What does Rich Voss masturbate to? 
[02:52:00]  Pictures of full crowd.  So am I a show?  I'm just going to say that.  Sold out signs.  Third show end.  What, at the Charles Square?  What do I think about?  I don't know.  Wise Guys Comedy Club?  Rich Voss this weekend?  Yeah.  You know you got porno on the laptop.  No.  What?  I have no porno.  He has to erase his history.  No, he has to go down in the briefcase.  What else is in the briefcase?  It's old calendars and old different things back in the day.  It's old stuff for me. 
[02:52:30]  I'll bring in the pictures.  You want to see some hot girls?  No, I'll bring in the briefcase.  Don't bring in just the photos.  Bring in that fucking briefcase.  We need the briefcase.  We would love to see.  That is FBI's dog.  I want to see your...  Can we go through your briefcase?  That would be hilarious.  Yeah, I'll do that next time.  Keep everything in there.  Try to at least.  I won't touch anything.  I'm sure you'll take some shit out.  I swear to God, I won't even open it.  Dude, how great would that be if he brings his briefcase?  It's not my briefcase for now.  It's from 20 years.  I got you.  Well, that's the beauty of it is to have it from so long ago.  Move over. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  I will.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Now you've done it.  Whoa.  Look at this.  Now you've done it.  All three of us.  You can't sit that close to anybody.  Rich, when you masturbate, you just use your imagination.  I don't look.  I don't like looking at it.  Look at Danny.  Look.  He's moving away.  Look.  He's moving away.  I don't look.  I don't.  I'll touch Jimmy.  Jimmy will touch you.  I look at some pictures.  Jimmy's got such a nice touch.  What are you doing, Rich?  My underwear is stuck in my balls.  You know what I mean? 
[02:53:30]  When they creep up on you.  No, because my ass.  My underwear.  I'm sorry.  Are we high and I don't know it?  What the fuck is going on?  Jimmy's got a crack.  Crack.  Crack.  I couldn't get it out.  No.  Because my balls don't have a crack in them.  My asshole.  That's what I was trying to say.  I should have just said.  A double?  One of them.  Oh, God.  All right, so you're bringing the briefcase in.  Yeah, I'll bring it in.  When?  Next week.  Please. 
[02:54:00]  Let's not wait on this one.  All right.  So when you're in this week, you're just like banking vacation time at this point?  Because you were supposed to be off this week?  Yeah, I think we're going to shut it down.  It's obvious we need to shut it down after today.  We finally reached our limit.  Are these like two days that you didn't have to come in and you can use later for vacation time?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll get it on the other side.  Some Fridays off or something.  Yeah, and we'll be back Monday.  So Rich, you're going to be a Trolley Square wise guy in Salt Lake City.  Yeah.  Those tickets are on sale. 
[02:54:30]  Come on.  I'm going to tell you something.  We were at, where were we?  Arizona?  The famous Arizona story.  And George Bush was staying at the fucking hotel.  And I called up Rich.  He came to my hotel hanging out.  And all of a sudden we'd go, let's go check out the Bush thing.  And they were Secret Service.  They fucking recognize Rich Voss.  Last Comic Standing fame.  They were like, holy shit, that's Rich Voss.  The Biltmore.  That was at the Biltmore.  The Biltmore.  What a fucking place.  Holy shit.  That's where the basketball players stay, too.  Well, then there was a hooker at the bar. 
[02:55:00]  Do you remember this?  And that's where Rich went.  And no, she was trying to pick up that guy and we fucking blew up her spot and she got  so mad at us.  We were just complete dicks.  I stayed at St. Regis a couple weeks ago, about a month ago.  That was fucking a whole nother world, man.  It was a cop.  Why was it a whole nother world?  We had a butler.  I didn't know what to do.  He knocked on the door.  St. Regis.  He goes, I'm your butler.  How did you get, like, what made you go, let's go stay at the St. Regis? 
[02:55:30]  Why St. Regis?  Because we did a fundraiser, a free benefit for the blind and they threw us.  Do they know they put you at the St. Regis?  Too bad it wasn't for the dead.  Whoa.  I haven't done that today.  So you said they put you up at the St. Regis?  No, it was one of the gifts.  Was it a suite?  Sorry.  Did you just stop just calling?  No, they put us up.  They put us up leading up to that the whole time.  Well, he did that at the Ritz-Carlton in South, down in Florida. 
[02:56:00]  And so then they put you up at the St. Regis the same night.  Yeah.  I can't even fucking talk.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy's killing me.  Oh, I've never heard Uncle...  Yeah, I've never heard it.  Oh, boy. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Don't...  You just...  Yeah.  Not now.  He'll work it in.  Yeah.  But I believe it starts with, huh?  Yeah.  Heh.  Heh.  Heh.  So, Voss, have fun in Salt Lake City.  You all right, Rich?  This is why I talk so much, because Opie enjoys that he can kick back and relax.  I don't give a fuck.  So, like, when it's me and Ron...  I get paid either way.  Yeah, so I'm like, I hear the dead air, and I go, uh...  So, Voss, you're gonna be...  No, I...  And then people are like, fucking shut up, Jay Moore. 
[02:57:00]  No, I talk enough.  Fuck it.  Nobody...  I was reading reviews.  Everybody loves you.  Why do you read that shit?  Why do you give a fucking credibility to these fucking scumbags...  Because it was on my email.  ...who send fucking their thoughts through the internet because they have no one with actual ears  that will listen to their fucking words.  That's a good point, Rich.  I see you on fucking the message board that I'm not gonna name.  He...  You know, right now they're typing, he's talking about us. 
[02:57:30]  Who?  Yeah, but wait, if you see me, why are you reading it?  I used to.  I quit Twitter.  I'm not even fucking doing any of that shit anymore.  You tweeted.  You don't do Twitter anymore?  I fucking hate it.  Yeah, because you're looking at...  It's just a lot of negative...  A lot of negativity.  But let's say it's not.  You're looking at it for the fucking positive.  It's the gayest, most fucking pathetic...  What are we, fucking 12-year-olds at a school play?  Did we do good, Mommy?  No.  Like, you just were here.  It was fun with your friends.  No, you're reading for some funny stuff.  You shouldn't have to go on a social media network to go, 
[02:58:00]  I wonder how it went.  Like, we were here.  We broke each other's balls.  I'm gonna walk in the elevator today going,  I had a fucking ball.  Jimmy touched Rich the whole show.  It made me laugh.  We talked off the air about some personal stuff.  We got some shit out of the way about...  Not you and me, like an argument.  You know what I'm talking about.  And it was fucking great.  If I go on fucking Twitter,  there's gonna be, out of 60 comments,  20 of them are gonna be like,  why do they have him in there?  They say that?  21, once I get on. 
[02:58:30]  Here's the thing, you might read some...  You might read some funny lines.  There's some good lines.  What, am I gonna use them?  No, you see what...  That's your fucking new material?  When Corvette guy, 420, drops a fucking funny...  And it's the anonymity that disgusts me.  Like, fucking Tree Fort Mike  and fucking Gang Rape Magoo  and all these fucking assholes  like fucking dog shit in the vagina  and all these people are like,  you fucking suck.  And I'm like, well, that's nice.  You have an entire Wikipedia page  and a career to go on 
[02:59:00]  and all I can say back to you is,  nice profile pic, asshole.  Like, it's fucking ridiculous.  You're arguing with fucking fate...  You're ghosts.  It's like the fucking Viet Cong.  They're fucking fighting ghosts out there, man.  Okay, uh, lunch lady, four or five.  Like, what, like, you fucking...  And you...  Lady trucker?  You fucking argue with these people.  I fight with them.  Do you really?  Why?  I want to create...  I've already patented this.  No, no, no, don't say it.  Oh, you're right,  because someone will steal it.  No, we actually got a... 
[02:59:30]  We got a business fucking thing.  Who does?  Me and Jay.  Let's forget it.  You don't get a piece, sorry.  Oh.  Me and Jay.  How many people do you block?  He hit...  Don't say shit.  I'm not fucking talking about the other thing.  Don't say the other thing, either.  I'm not.  Because the other thing should be a surprise.  How many people do you block?  A couple a day.  A couple a day?  Why?  I've blocked a total of ten people so far.  What I'm saying is,  you shouldn't have to...  When you go to your Twitter account,  which you joined for two reasons.  You joined Twitter  to have some fucking laughs 
[03:00:00]  and to sell tickets.  To promote, yeah.  But to have some laughs,  like, I'm going to type something...  And I'm playing golf.  People that are rich Boss fans  can go,  Oh, I live here.  This is where I play golf, too.  This is kind of interesting to me.  And then they just tweet back,  You're a mush-mouthed faggot.  And you're like,  Then what the fuck?  Like, why?  What is the fucking...  It's Babel.  It's a tower of fucking Babel.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  But for promoting purposes,  I'm not just going to get in there and go...  You're going to tell me Twitter fucking works? 
[03:00:30]  No.  That's why Ashton Kutcher movies  opened to fucking $5 million a weekend.  The guy has 7 million fucking followers.  If half of his followers saw his movies,  he'd be fucking bigger than Tom Cruise in China.  Well, okay.  Here's the thing.  Tom's big in China.  I believe...  Why?  You don't believe in promotions at all?  Because there's a billion people.  You don't believe in promotions at all?  I believe when I hit that fucking town,  I hit the radio stations  where the comedy club knows  what radio stations go to the demographic.  I give them everything I got.  I fucking put on a big show,  and then I go back. 
[03:01:00]  And then you do the show.  You shake people's hands once in a while.  That's why I don't shake hands.  I like when they get on the...  There's a twitch.  People started getting shitty on Twitter  going like,  yeah, thanks for not doing a fucking meet and greet.  I'm like, yeah.  Remember I did an hour and a half  and a standing ovation?  I thought that's where our relationship ended.  I didn't know I had to fucking go in the lobby  and fucking work the crowd  like a goddamn caucus.  Say caucus.  Caucus.  Damn it.  No problem there, baby.  No, it was a good one.  That's why you said it.  But you of all people, Rich, 
[03:01:30]  I can imagine you must just be  fucking beyond frustrated  when you go to your mentions page on Twitter.  Sometimes, yeah, but here's the problem.  Sometimes?  Yeah, because these guys do...  Go to it right now,  and I guarantee you,  you're a fucking piece of shit tenfold right now.  They think that they are Opie and Anthony  and Patrice and Norton.  They think that they...  They don't know the difference  between radio and real life.  They don't get it.  They don't get it.  Go to your mention page right now.  Leave them alone.  No!  I'm trying to get them off Twitter.  I'm looking at my app mentions. 
[03:02:00]  How old is he?  That shirt is for 20-year-olds.  Nice rugby shirt.  Isn't he late for homeroom?  These are on yours?  Oh.  Oh, because you tweeted the picture of him with the headphones.  Hey, Jim Norton,  are you sure that Voss doesn't have partial down syndrome?  See, that's why you go to Twitter.  And the replay,  you get to bleep out that guy's last name.  Yeah, we will.  We will.  You fucked it up, Jay Morse.  I did.  All right, I'm going to go to my Twitter account,  which I haven't tweeted.  Danny tried to save you, by the way.  We did.  Let it be known.  We got it. 
[03:02:30]  We got it.  He's getting a lot.  Oh, we did get it.  Yeah, it's all good.  You know what?  I did that Watch What Happens Live,  that show, that Andy Cohen show.  Yeah.  All my fucking tweets were positive.  Fucking gay people telling me I'm fabulous.  Half Slices.  Where was this?  The Half Slices crew.  It's a housewife thing on Bravo.  What did you say, Rich?  I said, where was this?  Oh, you want to do the show?  What is it?  Who's booking that show?  What is it?  I don't say that.  It's a hot new thing.  Yeah, everyone's doing it.  What is it?  Forget it.  I'm surprised they haven't called you. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  They should have called you by now.  You know what's amazing?  When you quit Twitter...  His eyes look lazy.  I'm tired.  I slept three and a half hours.  Oh, my love.  Three and a half hours.  A month goes by not being on Twitter,  and you get like...  I look at my phone,  there's like 150 mentions.  I'm like, I'm not there.  But you are.  You're there by being...  No, I go...  I pull it down.  I just did it now for emphasis.  I'll pull it down.  I'll hit Twitter,  and then I just go back... 
[03:03:30]  And then I just do that.  When are you going to get an iPhone?  I got to get one  because this phone is a fucking bag of dog shit.  Yeah, I know.  What is it?  My touch.  Can you text?  It's all to my touch.  Let's see some touching.  Why don't you let Jimmy just touch your leg?  Let him rub it for 10 seconds.  Why don't you let him rub your leg  for 10 seconds like this  on Opie's flip phone?  Stop with the gum.  Why are you taking another piece out?  I'm getting ready for...  Would you stop now with them?  Yeah.  Let's go through with the toys. 
[03:04:00]  You called those Nicorettes?  Did you eat them?  I got no choice.  Rich, what's your favorite movie of all time?  Days of Wine and Roses.  Jesus.  What?  That's a great answer.  It's a good answer.  What do you mean?  He just thinks it makes it sound smart  and like he likes it.  Here's the million dollar question.  Who's in it?  Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick.  All right.  All right.  So you're so moving.  Do you listen to music  when you ride around or talk radio?  Talk radio. 
[03:04:30]  Why?  I listen to Hannity?  Talk radio stinks.  I used to listen a lot too.  You're doing it.  You're fucking weird.  Talk radio.  Comedy is different  than fucking political talk.  Do you call this comedy?  This is fucking dead talk radio.  Political talk is fucking horrendous.  When you listen to music,  what do you listen to, Rich?  I listen to old music.  What I like.  Right down your top five wrong stuff.  Exile Main Street,  39 years ago today.  Fuck.  Thank you.  Rich, go ahead.  What do you listen to  when you're not doing the talk radio?  I got some of my greatest hits. 
[03:05:00]  I put them on CDs.  What is it?  I play it in the car.  Temptations, Cat Stevens.  Wait, CDs?  What about your iPod?  Oh, you don't have a connection?  Do you have an iPod?  Yeah.  I've been happy.  Rich, who's that person on TV?  Who's that boy?  It's from American Idol.  No.  No, that's the guy from Bravo.  What's his name?  From Project Runway.  Christian Suriano.  Okay.  You know why I know that?  Because you're a fag.  He's a fag.  He's got his gaze.  You need your gaze.  I'm working on my gaze  because they'll never fucking leave you.  And when you're old  and you're a has-been like Rich,  that's when they like you the most. 
[03:05:30]  That is true.  I guess it's myself.  Rich, what Temptations song?  Jesus.  Because I got fat, puffy eyes?  I think you're saying  they're too close together.  They're not bad.  I mean, from this distance.  You better get your head  and your ass wired together  or I will take a giant shit on you.  Shooky, ducky, crack, crack.  I am interested to know about my eyes  because if there is something,  I'd like to know about it  because I'll go get some fucking surgery 
[03:06:00]  and fix it because of you.  Oh, right.  Thank you, sweetie.  I'm so hungry.  I've never in my life  been told my eyes are too close together.  Especially not from a fucking midget.  Rich, your eyes are kind of close.  Yeah, way too close.  My eyes aren't close.  They're a little close.  Or your head's just too small.  You said that like somebody  who's doing a voice for their own dog.  My eyes aren't close.  Look how cute she is,  the little Yorkie.  My eyes aren't close.  I want to go for a walk.  Your eyes are close. 
[03:06:30]  My eyes aren't close.  I have Margaret Cho eyes  like I'm an Asian.  No, you look good.  No, I really want to know.  He wants to try to fix it.  What's your favorite Temptations song?  My favorite?  Jim, just shaking his head.  You're my everything.  That's a fucking great...  Is that a bad choice, Jimmy?  I don't know the song.  Can we hear a little bit of it?  Can we hear...  No, I don't.  It's a good...  Okay, because I don't like  fucking horrible heavy metal.  I like...  Margaret Cho eyes.  I have very, very, very taste of it.  Why is heavy metal horrible? 
[03:07:00]  That's stupid to say.  No, it isn't.  He thinks his music is the best.  What he loves is the best.  Well, that's what everyone thinks.  No, I don't.  I don't think mine's the best.  It's what I like.  All right, here we go.  Here's your Temptations song.  Oh, over here.  You got Margaret Cho's act.  You guys, quiet, you old Negro.  I'm listening to the music.  Sing it.  Sing it, Rich. 
[03:07:30]  Go with it, go.  Put your headphones on.  Close your eyes.  Let's do this.  Eddie Kedrick's up there.  Come on, Rich.  Let's hear it.  I like it, man.  I'm digging it, Rich.  I'll tell you what.  All right.  Hey, close your eyes.  Feel it.  You guys can sing.  What do you think?  I'm a fucking idiot?  I know I can't sing.  I fucking think you're doing good. 
[03:08:00]  Hold on.  Let me move over.  You got the words?  If I was one of those idiots in the back dance and I'd kill myself, just do a fucking tiny  pirouette your whole life.  Who farted?  I didn't fart.  Jesus Christ.  It was me, I'd tell you.  I didn't fart.  Hey.  This fucking thing is falling apart.  Who farted, really?  It was me.  Hey, look.  Somebody in Utah bought a ticket to Voss.  And I guarantee you, Voss, that's some fucking me talking about you. 
[03:08:30]  That's right.  Because you got the fucking promotion skills of somebody that's not very good at promotion.  See what I did there?  It's like talking to a Cyclops.  My ring.  You're going to have him so paranoid.  No, I don't give a fuck.  Rich cracks me up every time.  All right, listen.  Rich will tag.  Rich will get the most bizarre shit anything on your body.  I remember once we were filming Last Comic Standing, and I was making fun of Rich, and  then he goes, look how your feet are positioned when you stand, like fucking three o'clock. 
[03:09:00]  Like one foot was straight, and the other one was out, and that's when he decided the  fucking shit on him.  Go with.  But it was hysterical.  Let's go to the guy that bought a ticket to see Rich Voss in Salt Lake City.  One guy.  Wise Guy's County Club.  Ripped off Toronto, B. Anthony.  Trolley Square, Salt Lake City this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  Go ahead, Jason.  We don't have to sell tickets.  You sold us out, right?  It's 80 tickets.  You're going to have a good show.  All right.  Let's go, Jason.  Lots of fun.  Jason. 
[03:09:30]  Good morning, boys.  What's up?  Jay Moore, you're legendary.  Yeah, we bought four tickets to Rich Voss this weekend.  Why?  Well, they were given to me as a gift, I guess.  You're going to have a good time.  Speaking of Trolley Square, Jimmy Norton, we want you in Utah.  This is about Rich Voss.  Hey, what's your name?  Jason.  Hey, how's this golf course, Wing Point? 
[03:10:00]  Never heard of it.  Exactly.  It's by the airport?  How far is it?  It's fucking Salt Lake City.  A crack den is beautiful.  It's the most ridiculously beautiful city.  It's like from the, it's Gattaca.  Why don't you focus on your career instead of how good the golf course is on?  Well, how would I, my career how focused?  I go, I say, I kill, and I'm done.  But here's a guy that just got a question.  He already bought four tickets.  What the fuck?  We got him.  All you care about is the golf course again.  Hey, why don't you bring another couple?  Make it six.  That's what you fucking say.  You got to build it.  Work this shit.  I'm not Grady.  I'm not fucking, listen.  He's breaking four.  Obviously, 80 seats. 
[03:10:30]  You're better than 80 seats.  Have you been there before, Jason?  It's 100 seats.  To the comedy club?  It doesn't matter.  You've never been there.  I haven't been to the Trolley's.  I haven't been to the Trolley's Square one yet.  We go to.  You go to the big one.  You go to the big, you go to the adult room.  Yeah, they had one of your comic stand, Josh Blue, here last weekend.  That was pretty cool.  It's so funny.  Josh Blue's got the big room?  Rich should have the big room.  First of all, he offered me that, and I took this one.  Why?  Why?  What's wrong with you?  Let's break your self-esteem. 
[03:11:00]  Because I'm trying to make, I'll tell you later.  No, I mean, for real.  Keith Stubbs said to you, I want to bring you to the.  Well, he said, he, first of all, he said.  What is it?  What's it called, Jason?  Hold on, the West Valley, it's called?  Yeah.  The big room?  Yeah, there's the West Valley Club, I think.  Yeah, and that's a nice little club.  Because here's the thing, I've never been to that area, so I don't know how my draw would  be, and I'd rather go to a room that'll be full than a room that's not, if I don't draw  there.  How big is the other room?  Like 300.  300.  Shouldn't you?  It's not even that big.  Wouldn't you want to be in a valley instead of a square? 
[03:11:30]  No, I'd rather be downtown doing a small room.  I love doing fucking rooms.  I fucking love it.  I don't care.  I like doing theaters, too.  What about the long name?  Are you a Mormon, Jason?  No.  You laugh at those people.  Love the Mormons.  It's their thing.  No, it's cool here.  Joe Smith, right?  He's not bagging on our state.  That's cool.  Holy shit.  What?  Nothing.  Sorry, Hope. 
[03:12:00]  It's all good.  Hey, Jason, can you get 50 other people to go?  Hey, we're trying to promote it.  All right, dude.  Thanks, Alignment.  Get some people there.  But that golf course by the way, that's flat.  Oh, my God.  What a horrible loop.  God damn it, Rich.  Watch out, guys.  We'll see you Friday, boss.  See you later.  Jimmy's got a fucking mouthful of snot.  How are you going to...  Yogurt and blueberries, and boss just fucking jizzes all over his spoon.  How are you going to sell tickets with the old man hack, and then the fucking spit-up? 
[03:12:30]  Old man hack, that should be his stage name.  Old man hack.  Rich was spread that he's old man hack.  Holy shit.  It gets better.  We go to Idaho.  Josh, it gets better.  Josh.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook.  Nice.  Josh, go ahead.  Hey, did Rich just ask how an airport golf course was?  No.  You fucking idiot.  I said it's by the airport. 
[03:13:00]  And you know what?  No, Willie, stop.  Stop.  You fucking feed into these fucking idiots.  I said it's by the airport, and you know what?  So is Doral, you fucking moron.  I don't even think that's funny.  I don't want to laugh more to pile on.  Oh.  That's ridiculous.  He did ask that, too.  Aside from all the airline accidents that are going on, 747's taken off overhead.  It's on a flat plane.  Forget it.  It's garbage.  You fucking idiot.  Doral was right next to the golf to the airport.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It's right next to the mic.  The planes are in the distance. 
[03:13:30]  They don't affect your putting.  No, they're not.  They fly right over fucking Doral.  I played there a million times.  I just played there.  I play with you.  We know that.  We've told stories.  You played one time, you got hurt, and you quit.  I broke my hand in a sand truck.  Fucking homo.  Who breaks her hand?  They took the sand out to get it ready for the real golfers.  Remember?  Help me out here.  Rick, you named the one golf course in the entire world that's next to an airport that's  decent.  Wing point sucks.  It does.  Are you from Utah?  Yeah, I'm from Boise, but I grew up in Utah.  And by the way, I'm coming to your show. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not bringing anybody.  Because you're probably an O&A fan and have no friends.  Okay?  That's no surprise.  No, I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, listen to me, stupid.  What's a good course, then?  Thanksgiving point.  They play a PGA event there every year.  It's a great course.  Someone told me to play that course, but that's like a half an hour from downtown, isn't it?  Yeah, it's about a half hour, but it's a great course.  Salt Lake is so full of great courses.  And you're playing wing point.  Well, someone said that wing point was like the top five best courses in Utah. 
[03:14:30]  Is that not true?  Utah.  No, it's bottom five.  It's not good.  Okay, so I'm not going to play that.  I didn't know.  I only go by the information on what people tell me.  It's an airport course.  So is Doral.  Yeah, the one other airport course.  I'm not even looking.  Watch.  What?  I'm not even looking.  Well, no shit.  Perfect.  All right, Josh.  Thank you.  Airport golf.  So, yeah, Thanksgiving point is called?  Right.  I said thanks already to him.  That means he's good. 
[03:15:00]  All right, fuck him.  We have another guy that bought a thing.  Now, someone just tweeted,  Hey, Margaret Cho, Jay Moore is worried he has Margaret Cho eyes.  Now, I'm going to catch fucking shit from Margaret Cho people.  I didn't say fucking shit about Margaret Cho eyes.  I use her in my act.  How?  As a puppet?  I say Bonnie's ass is so flat when I fuck her from behind, I feel like I'm fucking Margaret Cho's face.  Why am I lying?  It's not your line I've been doing.  This fucking guy, I did a line in Montreal, and he goes to Slayton, that's a great line you do. 
[03:15:30]  It's my fucking line.  What one?  The one about, I like having sex with my wife when it's her time of the month, just so I can pretend I'm killing her.  Who said that?  What did I say about that line?  That was a good line?  Yeah, you said something like to Bobby Slayton, or you tweeted, Bobby Slayton had a great line.  And Bobby's using your line?  No, no, no, he missed you though.  Oh, I missed it.  Oh, you just missed it.  Oh, I gave Bobby Slayton credit for one of your lines.  Yeah.  By accident.  It wasn't on purpose.  Let me tell you something, kid.  Bobby Slayton's an interesting guy that he thinks this structure of success should be directly related to how long you've been in the business. 
[03:16:00]  I just had it.  What was that?  He just threw two bananas down and didn't break either one.  Are you kidding me?  They're totally normal.  You just picked up Jimmy's breakfast banana.  Let me have one now.  I'm not eating them anyway.  Why would you take the one out of the garbage when there's one on the counter?  Yeah.  I'm eating it now.  You're not eating it now.  No, no.  I'm going to eat it now.  Exactly.  Oh, the bananas suck as soon as you bruise them like that. 
[03:16:30]  Slayton.  Look at that.  That was his cup.  That's fine.  He's going to say the same thing.  Fuck.  Yeah, it looks like your penis.  It was brown.  You like brown?  It's my spit cup.  Oh, my God.  Can we hear his loogie for the first time?  Where are we loogieing?  All right.  Hit it.  Hey, we're trying to promote it.  All right, dude. 
[03:17:00]  Thanks a lot, man.  Get some people there.  How do you expect people to come to your show?  I want to buy tickets just so I can cancel them.  What a fucking great idea.  Don't do it.  No, no, no.  Don't fuck with his livelihood.  That's incredible.  What are you doing with your purse?  We never fuck with his livelihood in the end.  Poor guy.  Oh, God, Rich.  Why do you have such horrible things in your throat? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, what's going on, Rich?  Is that your answer?  Boy, I tell you.  It's a rough week.  Hey, Wang, don't tell him you're Jewish, okay?  That's the Vinnie Boom bots.  Okay, all right.  This time flies by today.  We can wrap up.  It flew by quick.  Who wants to start this?  Rich, Salt Lake City?  That's nothing.  You can go further with the banana.  It really is, like, being stoned. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, it's somewhere we did pot, I think.  Yesterday, I really, like, lost my shit when Ronnie was doing fucking half slices.  I know.  I really had a problem.  Save the Paul Reiser thing.  I had a problem.  Fucking, I gave you credit for that on that video.  Well, how long was Paul in here?  Not for bad.  Paul was in here.  Oh, way too long.  Yeah, it was really weird.  Half hour.  He just kept saying over and over.  I don't want to work.  I don't want to write.  Wait, I guess we were supposed to be starstruck or something.  He's got to be worth fucking so much money. 
[03:18:30]  You can't even count that high.  Is he really worth a lot?  Yeah, he gets back in.  He shows his syndication, right?  A hundred mil?  No.  Up that area.  Wow.  I mean, it went, what, eight years?  Seven.  Or maybe eight years.  And how come...  He co-created it, I think, with Danny Jacobson.  And so, I mean, that's like, literally, you go to...  The guy that created Married with Children...  Right.  ...went to his mailbox and there was a check for a hundred million dollars.  No.  Yeah, like, I'm not...  Wow.  That's exactly correct. 
[03:19:00]  One check?  Like, here's your fucking...  Here's your cut.  When it all, like...  Came in.  When it all just steamrolled and, like, it just keeps going.  And then it gets to Japan.  And then when people...  There's some...  I forget what it's called.  Like, it's a format fee.  Like, we want to do a show like that, but we're going to call it something else with Japanese people.  So they've got to pay for that.  Yeah.  See, that's why you kick on road with the comics of O&A.  Exactly.  Well, you know what Seinfeld gets every year?  It goes into...  They renew him.  A lot.  Well, how much? 
[03:19:30]  A lot.  Do you like Seinfeld for real?  Huh?  I thought he got a real easy fucking pass on that conversation yesterday.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, I think he's a good comic.  Like, Louis was going, it's great.  He goes on stage just the exact hour.  It's incredible.  And I'm like, that's fucking horrible.  No, he switched, though.  So, he said he does like probably 20, I'm going to guess he probably phased in at 20  new and it's a year or whatever.  I like that you guys come up with new shit.  I don't understand him being a comic and doing the same fucking...  When these guys roll into Caroline's when I was going there a lot, I'm like, why are 
[03:20:00]  you doing the exact same fucking hour I heard last year?  But he'll burn material.  But why?  Why?  Seinfeld will burn material on TV.  Like, a lot of guys, like Rodney's act was the same.  A lot of guys had that school of thought, but they burn material on television.  But...  New material they just do on TV and then it's done, you can't do it again.  But I get someone like Rodney doing the same set, absolutely.  But you guys mixing it up, of course.  I mean...  I want to do a special just to be done with the material.  Yeah, I know.  You guys all do that.  A lot of you guys do that.  But I haven't done one since Comedy Central 15 years ago. 
[03:20:30]  And then you could just leave that behind and then you start fresh.  I like when you guys do that.  Yeah, I would like to do that.  Why don't you do an hour?  How come you're not doing an hour?  Nobody really feels like me being on the show doing an hour.  HBO and Comedy Central said no thanks.  To you?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And then Showtime said we'll do it for fucking...  There is justice in this world.  You're a fucking douche, man.  What about Showtime?  You really are a douche.  No, you know I'm only kidding.  Why don't you fucking do an hour?  Yeah, why don't I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  But why don't you do it yourself?  You go out and shoot it yourself.  Rich, I like when Rich comes to you with these fucking big kakamamy business ideas 
[03:21:00]  that you've never thought of before.  Wait, so how does this work?  I'll film myself at a theater in Memphis, and then I'll bring that to the networks  and tell them, like, you should put this on.  Is that what you're saying?  Do your own acquisition.  What?  Really?  Your own what?  You're not fucking with me.  No.  So I would film it myself.  Yes.  Like, I would hire a crew.  Like, go in my pocket. 
[03:21:30]  It costs you whatever.  50, 60, 100 grand.  You do it.  No, what?  What the fuck are you filming?  That's what they fucking call it?  A fucking music video on a fucking Navy hangar?  That's what they're paying.  What do you think?  What do you think?  It's like a dirtbag time.  When we shot Comics Anonymous, it was almost 80 grand to shoot that.  You could probably shoot your act all in with sound and mic and everything with the crowd.  Six grand.  Four, three cameras.  Are you out of, and edit and do it, and do it, not do it TV quality. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, but if you're going to, sorry.  If you're going to do it.  What do you think arts costs?  That last one we did was about 80, 90 grand.  Where do you fucking think that money goes?  If it was value of what?  The fucking producers.  To the people that were shooting and everything.  The people know.  What I'm saying, I know what you're saying.  You could get a crew.  So you explain this to me.  I would have, I would pay for it myself.  Yes, yes.  And do an hour.  Yes, you can do that.  And you could bring it and sell it.  You know this is cruel, right?  Are you fucking serious?  Who would I sell it to?  This is cruel, you know. 
[03:22:30]  I would sell it to like, oh, I would sell it to Comedy Central.  Or Showtime.  No, you can't do that.  Why can't?  What do you mean when they do?  This is really cruel.  I'm saying this.  Why?  Because you already thought of this and talked about it?  What's fucking Business 101?  Dude, they all know this.  You get the paper out.  Why are you clean into this?  You throw the papers up onto the front door.  That's what you don't get.  That way they don't have to go to the store and buy any paper.  No, but here's what you don't get.  You're saying they said no to you already.  But if you go in there with a finished product, that's good. 
[03:23:00]  This is really cruel.  Red, shut up.  Oh, you already shot it and they said no to...  No!  He knows all this.  That's the fucking...  That's business acumen.  That's what you do.  Everyone knows this.  Then why don't you do it?  I forget it.  Well, hold on.  Then why don't you do it?  You got the money?  You got the money?  I love it.  Sorry.  You got the money?  I'm planning on doing it.  You got the mola?  All right, tell us a big fucking deal.  The big deal is I just wanted to lead you down that fucking path of like, let me explain 
[03:23:30]  to you how showbiz works.  No, I know you knew it.  I'm not a fucking...  No, you didn't know.  I did know.  You didn't really know, Red.  I did know.  Red, you didn't know because Jimmy goes, are you serious?  And you go, yeah!  You didn't know.  I didn't know.  Why are you so filled with fucking snot?  Yeah.  I'm just seeing what I can get out.  If Anthony was here, he'd be fucking involved.  That little head, like where brains should be, is just a mucus fucking membranes.  Whoa.  Oh, damn.  Rimmed out.  Fucking UNLV versus Ohio State.  Listen, let's get the fuck out of here for real.  Jay Moores is going to be at a Gotham Comedy Club, excuse me, tomorrow and tonight? 
[03:24:00]  Or tonight, tomorrow?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Tonight and tomorrow.  All right.  And Rich here will be in...  Rich, you're doing...  Hold on.  You're doing Gotham?  No, I'll do it tomorrow night.  Will you do it...  All right.  Maybe you work something out with Jay Moores.  You think I'll get more people if they think Rich is going to be there?  Okay.  Why not?  Definitely.  Let's do it.  Wow.  Let's do this then.  Special guests.  More importantly, Jay Moores at the Bregada this weekend.  You should be promoting that show.  Saturday at the Bregada.  That's going to be a great show.  Fill this fucking place.  Come on.  Where are the pests?  Who's opening for you there at the Bregada? 
[03:24:30]  I think it's Matt Arise, maybe.  He's a funny guy, man.  If he's not available, you want to do it?  I'll be in Salt Lake.  Blow off that gig.  I'll Skype it in.  Do the Bregada.  You'll Skype it in.  That's pretty good.  I like that.  You would do that.  I would do that.  With him, I would.  All right, Voss, listen.  Wise Guys Comedy Club, Charlie Square, Salt Lake City, Utah, this Friday and Saturday, okay?  Yeah.  Wiseguyscomedy.com.  And then Jimmy's got some things.

Where are you going to be open?  I'm going to be just wandering around.  Going back to bed?  Tonight?  Today?  No.  Let's go do something.  I'm going back to bed.  You tired?  Do they put you up?  Huh?  Who's they?  Yeah.  Who's they? 
[03:25:30]  You shit your pants, stupid.  He shit his pants?  Look, that's where he's got to go.  When are you going to get that bag back to Godfrey?  Let's get out of here.  I'll leave you with this.  I don't know.  I think we're done until Hank gets back on Monday.  I think we're going to shut her down.  But I'm going to wander around.  Maybe do a little long fez later this week or something.  All right, guys.  We leave you with the one question thing that Sam does, and we'll see you soon.
