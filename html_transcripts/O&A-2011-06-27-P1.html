<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion surrounding the New York Gay Pride Parade, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton heavily criticizing the perceived flamboyance of some participants, using highly offensive and homophobic language to compare the parade's imagery to negative racial stereotypes.  This led to a broader conversation about societal acceptance of homosexuality, gay adoption, and the perceived hypocrisy of those opposing gay marriage, particularly in light of high divorce rates.  The hosts also engaged in playful but irritated banter with E-Rock about his consistent tardiness to work, highlighting the lack of interns and the resulting difficulties, such as the upcoming interview with Linda Hogan.  Listener-submitted "fuck you" messages and a "Bill Tetley" jingle punctuated this segment.

The show then moved to a discussion about the upcoming interview with Linda Hogan, referencing allegations made by the Warrior about her relationship with Hulk Hogan, including claims of sex with multiple people. The hosts also mentioned a note with the phrase "black cock" written on it.  This transitioned into further complaints about the lack of interns, followed by Anthony's fabricated excuse of a haircut appointment to avoid a meeting with his boss.  The conversation shifted to the weight gain of former baseball players Dwight Gooden and David Wells, with speculation about Gooden's drug use.  A significant portion focused on the Casey Anthony trial, including the hosts' opinions on her guilt and online trolling of her supporters. The show then unexpectedly pivoted to discussions of Carol Burnett's comedy, followed by graphic descriptions and crude jokes about Luca Crisco, a man arrested for voyeurism in a porta-potty at a yoga festival, and various online pornography videos.  The segment concluded with a lengthy and detailed discussion about car leasing, including a phone call with a car dealer, Andy, and a debate with a caller, Phil, about negotiating lease deals, focusing on invoice prices, holdbacks, and acquisition fees.

The next segment began with more discussions of car buying and leasing, featuring caller "Al" sharing his strategies (or lack thereof) using Kelley Blue Book. The discussion touched on the difficulties of selling used cars and DMV regulations.  This abruptly changed to a humorous bit mimicking Elijah Wood's frequent use of "yeah," followed by a discussion of Tracy Morgan's return to stand-up comedy after an anti-gay rant, detailing offensive jokes from his performance and the criticism they generated.  The hosts then criticized the underutilization of Black talent on Saturday Night Live, mentioning Tracy Morgan, Chris Rock, and Garrett Morris, playing a clip of a Brian Fellows sketch.  The segment concluded with a highly critical and offensively worded discussion of the Swedish preschool, Egalia, and its gender-neutral approach, followed by a discussion of media bias in reporting racial violence.  A magician, Dan White, was interviewed in-studio, performing several magic tricks.

The final segment featured Dan White's continued performance of magic tricks, including making an "L" appear on a dollar bill and bending a quarter.  The hosts and Dan discussed the evolution of magic and Dan's Discovery Channel show, *The Supernaturalist*.  This transitioned into a discussion of a woman's unusual obsession with the Berlin Wall, prompting highly vulgar and sexually explicit jokes. The hosts chose a "Line of the Day" and made some announcements before Dan White and one of the hosts departed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  The laughs have already begun.  Yes, hi.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. We've got to jump right into this.  Good morning.  So the gays can get married, congratulations to them.  Congrats to the gay.  The show is, we're friends of the gays.  Yes, we're very gay-friendly. 
[00:01:00]  That's our stance.  Gay-friendly, everyone? Gay-friendly?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm all right with the gays.  Yeah, I am.  But, with that said, the pictures that are coming out from this gay pride parade...  Yeah.  ...doesn't really help the cause.  It's like, the gay community, they don't understand why the whole country's not behind them.  Yeah.  They don't understand why the country just doesn't get this whole gay marriage thing.  And all you have to do is, you know, kind of thumb through your paper this morning. 
[00:01:30]  And you'll understand why some people are uncomfortable with this.  It's a very flamboyant display of the gay.  And they love being in little short shorts and being shirtless.  And, unfortunately, they're representing the gays as a whole.  Because this is what we see today.  Yes.  And that's why a lot of people in this country are kind of uncomfortable with it.  There's a picture in the Daily News, and I know they were trying to be careful with what pictures they chose to have in the paper today. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  You got, you got, I don't even know how to explain this, actually.  You got, you got two guys.  Mm-hmm.  Well, there's three in the picture.  Yeah.  The guy on the right is wearing angel wings.  Little angel wings on his back.  And white shorts, and that's it.  Yep.  And he, it looks like, would be the groom in this gay marriage little costume thing they're doing for the gay pride parade.  Yeah.  The, um, the guy on the left is dressed in a prom dress, a white prom dress, possibly a wedding dress, I guess. 
[00:02:30]  I'm guessing a maid of honor.  Well, what?  I'm guessing a maid of honor.  That's the maid of honor?  Yeah.  And then in the middle.  That's the bride?  In the beautiful, long bridal dress is some gentleman.  Backless, by the way.  Yes, backless.  Wow.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  This is why.  See, GLAAD should be working on this shit instead of a dumb joke that Tracy did on a comedy stage, if you want to know my humble opinion here. 
[00:03:00]  What Tracy did is harmless to the gay community.  This is what's fucking up the gay community.  Yeah.  This is what's fucking up the gay community.  GLAAD should come, should get out there and go, guys, can you comment the fuck down?  We're trying to get things done in our community.  We're really trying to, uh, you know, be a little more mainstream.  And then it's just this.  It's a Halloween fucking party.  They love being over-the-top flamboyant. 
[00:03:30]  And that's why people are uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It's not because Tracy is telling a dumb joke on a comedy stage.  Maybe people would feel better if they just walked around in suits and acted like nice, normal.  Well, yeah.  I was telling Anthony right before the show, imagine some kind of black pride parade and all it is is gangsters.  Yeah.  And people like eating chunks of watermelon.  Right.  And just eating fried chicken and every stereotype around.  And people would be like, oh, geez.  There they go.  The people that, uh, don't like black people would hate black people even more if that's all they saw of it. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Exactly.  Some guy, uh, unfortunately I didn't retweet it.  He tweeted a picture of, of a Smurf that's really happy he could get married now.  A guy that was, what, painted blue?  Painted blue.  Painted the money.  He barely had clothes on to begin with and then the rest of them was blue and, and this guy was celebrating the fact that gays could be married now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man, I, I don't get it. 
[00:04:30]  They love it though.  A lot of rainbow flags.  Flags.  Well, the rainbow flag is their thing.  That's fine.  Yeah.  But it's the, let's all not wear shirts.  Let's let's half of us wear angel wings and the other half will wear feathers.  And you see the one guy that was dressed as a peacock, a peacock that was on TV just a couple of minutes ago.  He was, he, he had 10 feet of feathers around him.  How is that going to help your cause? 
[00:05:00]  Where did they get this stuff?  Huh?  Where did they get this stuff?  The Halloween store, the gay store.  It's the, it's the, uh, the Christmas store, but, um, Christmas isn't around.  I think he could get other things in there.  Look, I mean.  Yeah.  The rainbow wig, the, the dresses.  Uh.  Is this Brazil?  Yeah.  It looks like carnival.  With just gay.  I hear there were shirts people were wearing that says marriage is so gay.  Which, uh, now it's using the word as not like, you know, it's double entendre. 
[00:05:30]  How they say the word shouldn't be used.  Like, oh, that's gay.  That's gay.  But they're saying, you know, marriage is so gay.  Meaning you could get married if you're gay.  Right.  But the double meaning is the one they don't like.  But, you know, they're using it.  So that's okay, I guess.  Do you think, uh, New York passed this because they need the money?  Yeah.  You think, uh.  A lot of money associated with marriages and stuff, right? 
[00:06:00]  Is there?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Pumps a little more money into the, uh, into the economy.  Pumps.  Also afraid of a riot on Sunday.  I think two days before they knew it would be a major problem.  Yeah.  Because that wasn't, uh.  Oh, forget about it.  That would have been an ugly scene someday.  They'd have broken into stores and decorated the windows with nice curtains.  Made flower arrangements.  You know, because they're gay.  Yes.  But.  Thousands of dollars in improvements were made. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  So I, I think that's it in a nutshell.  Nuts.  You know, the people that are a little, little uncomfortable with this, they really, really  look at some of these pictures coming out from the gay pride parade.  Yeah.  And they just rip their shirts off.  And they're in the littlest short shorts.  Right.  They love being gay.  Love it.  And I guess it's the end thing for a politician to show up at these things now, finally.  Well, Cuomo, uh.  For many years.  What a hit he is with the, uh, gay community. 
[00:07:00]  Because, uh, you know, he's the guy.  He's the guy that had to go before.  Um.  Yeah.  Well.  They're talking about him as presidential timber.  Really?  Maybe for the next election.  Yeah.  He's got to do this thing for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll do the New York thing and, uh, see what happens.  But.  Yeah.  I mean.  I mean.  Yeah.  Does that guy have to have his nipples painted red?  As he's walking with a giant hula hoop? 
[00:07:30]  The shortest little feather skirt, red stockings, fishnets.  But, but Glad's going to worry about Tracy Morgan.  How about you worry about that guy?  Elbow high, red gloves.  I think he's misrepresenting you guys a little, a little more than Tracy Morgan.  Yes.  Get your priorities in order.  And then there's a tranny vaudevillian behind him.  It's Jay.  I.  I don't even know what he's supposed to be. 
[00:08:00]  What is that supposed to be?  What character is that?  He looks like a circus big top, um, guy.  The ring, the ring leader.  Ring master.  Ring master of a circus.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, wearing red fishnets and, uh, lovely shoes.  Don't look very practical.  Ooh.  But his dogs were barking all night.  Here, go to the next picture.  It's fantastic.  Come on.  There you go.  What is that?  I don't know what he's trying to do. 
[00:08:30]  Like.  Red hair and dye and a giant big ring.  Died red hair.  And dyed really weird looking mustache and, like, black painted in circles under his eyes.  And then a guy completely dressed as a woman next to him.  Right.  With a, uh, uh, one of those Asian paper umbrellas that you'd see in a drink.  Mm-hmm.  With a full-sized one.  That's gotta be a guy.  I think that was a lady, actually.  Why would that be a lady?  Shouldn't Glad be down there just slapping people going, knock it off?  What are you doing?  We're trying to get things done here.  Do you know what this is doing? 
[00:09:00]  Gotta call out Glad.  I mean, they're just ridiculous.  Yeah.  I like when the, like, float things go by and it's just got men making out with each other.  Mm-hmm.  Like, oh, wait, was that a gay stormtrooper from Star Wars?  Yes.  Look.  Look.  You know, I'm fine with the gays and the marriage thing, even.  But when you take an institution like Star Wars.  Now we got a problem.  And paint rainbows.  I know.  Down the middle of a stormtrooper.  And actually make it cooler.  That's stupid Lucas.  There's furry animals. 
[00:09:30]  It's less gay.  It's less gay now than it was.  All right.  Next picture.  All from the Gay Pride Parade.  Oh, that's nice.  I don't know what that is.  A red bow tie with nothing else on.  That's terrific.  The red bow tie.  That's terrific.  Very popular item.  That and suspenders and nothing else.  That's great.  The guy just to his right has quite the gay face.  I should have photographed this woman I saw Sunday night.  She had a, by the cellar, she had a dyke written down her leg in ink. 
[00:10:00]  Like big, big letters down the right leg.  Just D-Y-K-E.  What are you going to do?  Did you see the girl with the t-shirt with the C word on it?  Oh, that was good on the news.  The old cuntaloo?  No.  Walked by the news camera.  It's on my Twitter.  Oh, is she empowering it?  Huh?  Like empowering herself?  Yeah, but she walked right on camera.  I think it was MSNBC or somebody was doing their thing.  Just says cunt on her shirt.  Right.  Walking right behind the reporter.  Quite a few people I'd love to buy that for. 
[00:10:30]  A great gift.  Yes.  But don't these people get together and go, look, it's not going to help our cause  if you walk around with the word cunt on your shirt?  Yeah, people see it as offensive.  This is okay, but Tracy Morgan joking about some of the things people go through is not okay?  Little red boxer shorts.  Well, Tracy Morgan was enforcing negative attitudes.  This doesn't, of course, but Tracy Morgan did.  Oh, yeah.  But this doesn't reinforce any negative stereotypes.  For the people that don't understand sarcasm, there was a lot of sarcasm in what Jimmy just said. 
[00:11:00]  Thank you.  Because we have people that just don't understand.  If anybody didn't get that with sarcastic, I would prefer they didn't get it.  I would bet you a few people didn't get that.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to the pictures.  Yeah.  Just red short shorts.  Nothing else.  Who's wearing the skirts?  Dykes, maybe.  Okay.  And that's Broadway bodies.  Is that what that is?  Okay.  And what do they do?  I guess they dance in the street. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  I don't know.  Keith had to work the detail.  Oh, my God.  There's pictures of him with, like, trannies and kind of smiling.  Like, eh, what are you going to do?  That guy's wearing his high heels and really short green shorts where his balls are pretty much sticking out the bottom.  I think that's a thing.  Like, you've got to wear shorts that is tight enough where every other gay man can see your cock and balls.  It's like a how do you do, I think. 
[00:12:00]  But this, you know, people, this is, a lot of people, this is all they see when it comes to gay stuff.  And that's why they get offended.  It's like, you know, if I was walking my child down there and I see a guy making out with another man, he's wearing angel wings, his nipples are painted.  Look, my point is, you know, go walk around like that if you want.  That's fine.  I don't care.  I would walk my kid through that in a second.  I wouldn't care.  He gives a shit.  I would explain it to him if he was able to understand words.  Say, never, ever want to do this. 
[00:12:30]  But my point, once again, if you're trying to help your cause along, this certainly doesn't change people's opinions.  Nah.  That, you know, are kind of closed-minded about a lot of stuff.  Next picture, please.  Just a couple of chicks making out.  Oh, okay.  A couple of girls just making out, loving the day, loving the gay.  There's a couple of old gay guys, which, as we've always said, being gay is for the young. 
[00:13:00]  It's for the young.  Old gays, old queens, very, very sad.  Just them and their dog.  I was in Central Park yesterday and I saw two very old lesbians holding hands.  Old lesbians.  And I was just laughing, thinking, like, there was a time you had a woman in your own family that had the short, dykey hair and everyone always wondered why she wasn't married.  You should grow your hair out. 
[00:13:30]  You look so pretty.  Because they just weren't allowed to.  Ah, it's all right.  I don't know.  Short, it's easy to keep up with this short.  Just wearing loose, baggy clothes.  And you realize.  And she would bring a friend over to dinner.  That's what I'm saying.  Just a friend.  I laugh, but that's got to suck for them.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Yep.  But those days are in our rear view mirror.  Eh, rear. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, and Governor Christie there in Jersey saying,  No way.  Don't look for this to happen in Jersey.  He's against it.  He's for civil unions for the gay, but does not want the gay to be able to get married in the, you know, typical sense of the word, man and woman.  I think every state's going to legalize this.  It's going to take time.  Six so far, right?  Something like that.  And I think, you know, if Christie isn't for it, the next guy that's governor will probably will be. 
[00:14:30]  So eventually I think it's going to be every state.  Legally, I see it as it's an absolute discrimination.  Yes, of course.  Against people for their sexual orientation that they cannot get married.  Getting married isn't a right, so you can't really claim it as infringing on someone's right.  But just as a basic human right, where we're so big in this country on saying, you know, hey, everyone should be treated equal. 
[00:15:00]  But you're not giving them the ability to get married.  And you're using the law to keep them from getting married.  That, to me, is a little odd.  Whether you like it or not, I'm just speaking as, you know, the law goes.  Sure.  It just seems like it's blatant discrimination.  Do you know I've never seen one group in this country want their own rights to do something taken away?  I don't think in the history of this country has one group ever said, the group I belong to should not be allowed to do it, but you or you should. 
[00:15:30]  It is always people standing there saying why I should be allowed to do it, but you shouldn't.  You shouldn't.  That's what the whole country is.  It drives me fucking crazy.  If they just said, look, we don't like fucking gays, we think they're a disgrace, and we know we're discriminating, but they look like they're not discriminating.  The mics were on, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I thought you were just chatting. 
[00:16:00]  I'm sorry.  But you know what I mean?  It's like they always try to act.  People always try to act like, here's the reason why I can do it and you can't.  Yeah.  They're never just honest about the fact that they're being, it's like, fuck Chris Christie.  How about if we don't like fucking big fat motherfuckers?  Are you going to tell me that's not a choice?  Yeah.  There's a choice.  You know, I'm sick and tired of big fat fucks.  Like you.  And the politicians.  Stinking up every seat you sit on.  What do you think of them apples?  And politicians do always use it under the guise of protecting.  They're never taking anything away from somebody. 
[00:16:30]  They're giving people something.  That's why they call it, you know, the Marriage Protection Act.  Sure.  It's protecting you as a man and a woman, your sacred marriage from this perversion of two  men or two women being married.  It's not like, hey, we don't want you getting married, but we want to protect the people that  are getting married and the institution of marriage, which is wonderful with the divorce  rate and the rate of people punching their spouse in the face and shit like that. 
[00:17:00]  Believe me, it's not that great an institution that it needs protection.  And they're fighting to do things that straight people are marriage and the military.  The two shittiest parts of being straight.  It's like they're fighting to do it.  Who are we to say you can't do it?  They want to join the military and they're being told no.  Right.  I don't want to join the military.  I was never brave enough to do that.  Yeah.  You know, you want to go and fucking and fight is please take my spot.  Military is a weird thing, though.  It's not real life.  It's not really a democracy. 
[00:17:30]  You know, it's pretty much a dictatorship in the military run by the boss.  You know, it's a dictator.  Don't want to be a dictatorship.  Yeah.  But I think this is going to happen.  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Oh, yes, but it is people's people's arguments against it are enraging because it's all just  based on the fact that you don't like something.  You're not comfortable.  You're religious horse shit makes you uncomfortable. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I'll tell you, when I see two men kissing, it makes me very uncomfortable.  Like, I get kind of a, like, oh, oh, that's, oh, that's, oh, but, but, you know, I could  give a shit if they're pounding each other in the ass.  It's their business.  Yeah, kissing seems to be more intimate.  Kissing's a little too, so, yeah, it's just, and look, I'm not knocking it, hey, if that's  what you're into, that's fine.  I'm not fucking, you know, hey, if you see two guys kiss and beat the shit out of them. 
[00:18:30]  Like, I, nothing, I don't care.  But there's something very, yeah, there's something, it's a, it's sort of a revulsion  to it.  As a heterosexual guy, you look at that and there is this kind of like, ugh, like whiskers  and, and, and just the, the closed eyes and, oh, it's just.  The smell of a man's hot mouth.  It's so, it's so gay.  I just started watching Six Feet Under. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like three episodes into the first season.  It's a great show, isn't it?  It's very good, yeah.  I didn't realize that Michael, whatever his name, Michael Hall was in that first before  Dexter.  So there's this, one of the guys is gay and his, his, his boyfriend is a black cop.  And, uh, just the kissing scenes with the face holding, they're kissing through grief.  He's grieving and kissing his boy.  And I actually got like, ah, it didn't offend me.  Like, like I got angry. 
[00:19:30]  I was just like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quick, eat his ass.  It's not an anger.  I'm not offended by it, but it's uncomfortable.  It's not an anger thing.  And I think a lot of, uh, gays and, and gay organizations see that as, uh, uh, gay bashing and, and hatred and, uh, you know, uh, that you, you want, you want to stop or there'll be violence.  No, but it's just some kind of a visceral thing.  It's a, you know, a feeling of revulsion. 
[00:20:00]  Somebody should interview gay comedians and talk to them about stuff.  All right.  Jimmy, what do you think?  Well, I'm not gay.  I've just, I've just made the trip.  I was going to say somebody should interview gay comedians.  Were you just visiting?  I was, dude, I was visiting.  I was stopping over.  I dropped something.  It took a lot longer to pick it up than I thought it was.  Who does that joke?  Me.  Is that your joke?  About going to Europe?  Oh, it's a great joke.  I apologize.  Thanks.  For some reason, I forgot that was your joke.  Yeah.  It's a great joke that Jimmy came up with. 
[00:20:30]  Um, I, uh, on Wednesday.  What is it?  You can visit Europe, but you're not a European.  Yeah, because I was talking about, like, I think, transsexuals, whatever I said, just  because I go to Europe doesn't mean, uh, as long as I come back to America, I'm still  an American who went to Europe and enjoyed it a lot more than he thought he would.  That's a great line, man.  Um, I, I'm going to plug something because I interviewed two gay comics.  I was going to joke and then plug myself.  Jim David and Rick Cromwell were buddies of mine.  And after Tracy did what happened, I interviewed them to talk about speech and did they have,  what, what they felt about it? 
[00:21:00]  Because they're like, they're both out.  And Rick is the guy that was in the Louie episode explaining why faggot is such a rough  word for gay people.  Yes.  I actually lead off the special with that, um, with that scene.  And, uh, it's great.  And DePaulo.  Oh, right.  Faggot.  So Wednesday at five o'clock on Raw Dog on the East Coast, I'll be playing that interview.  And it's pretty insightful to hear these guys because there's a couple of points that  Jim made.  I was like, oh, fuck.  I didn't think of that.  Even though I'm still a hundred percent for Tracy, but a couple of, uh, points that were made  were things I hadn't considered.  Is he saying that Tracy shouldn't have said that on a comedy stage? 
[00:21:30]  I keep going.  He, Jim was saying, basically Jim, Jim's a standup.  So he knows that, you know, um, he was saying that he understands it's his right to do it,  but he goes, they're just sick of it.  They're just sick of it.  And it's like, I understand that even though I still think, but he made a couple of other  points about why he was against it, but you can't censor.  Judy Gold, I tried to get, but she's fucking rehearsing for something because she's phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  We're, uh, all right.  Judy's an animal.  We'll have to check that out. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It's actually good.  It's, uh, they were both very open and honest and, uh, a lot of comedians I know are  not out.  So I called a few people.  I didn't want to do it because I was like, turn it off.  All right.  So a big weekend here in New York with that whole thing.  Yes.  I think we got the audio of the official announcement here.  Zolio, O'Mara, Ranzenhofer, Richie, Roback, Seward, Skelos, Young, and Zeldin.  Ayes 33, nays 29. 
[00:22:30]  I don't understand what that was.  That's the vote.  33 to 29 it passed.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And then a guy took out his dick and started banging it on the table.  Yeah.  That's what you're hearing?  That was a thumping sound.  It was Charlie Rangel, of course.  They didn't want the white guy to do it.  Charlie Rangel.  Order in the court. 
[00:23:00]  Order in the court.  Order in the house.  Who's the asshole trying to take the moment away?  I mean, this is a huge deal.  And this guy, oh, God, I need order in the court.  Must have been one of the nays. 
[00:23:30]  Probably.  Oh, yeah.  But who's the asshole?  Relax and let the moment just be.  I know.  I have your attention.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You are gay. 
[00:24:00]  You are gay.  You can hear them.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we just, there's, I understand if they have your attention, bill  number 1545, the bill is passed.  I asked, please, we have more business to continue.  Wow.  There you go.  We have more business to continue.  Good for them.  Good for them.  Good.  Good for the gay.  Yeah.  You want to get married, go ahead.  I think you're dumb. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You want to throw yourself into that fucking shit misery and that dumb.  Well, I heard one guy was saying, we pay the same taxes and it's like, eh, you know, they're  fucking forced to pay the same, same sales tax, the same income tax, come on.  Mm-hmm.  And they don't get a lot of the tax breaks that fucking married couples get, right?  You don't get that exemption.  I guess.  I guess.  Inland unions, they might, but.  Yeah, maybe.  It's just the point.  I'm seeing one of my gay friends today.  Oh!  Sorry.  I'll have to ask him about it.  And he's partnered up.  He'll be honest.  He's partnered up.  Last time I talked to him about it, he's like, I don't give a fuck if we're allowed to 
[00:25:00]  get married.  We just want to, you know, make sure we could see each other if God forbid we're sick or something.  You know, that's all he cared about at the time.  Right.  Like, you know, they're not allowed in the hospital.  Yeah, not the stereotypical let's go for the joke sick, but in general, if, you know,  his partner's sick, he wants to be able to fucking be able to be there, you know?  Yeah, things like that.  Shit like that bothered this individual.  He said, but he didn't really give a crap if they got married.  What do you think about gay couples adopting children? 
[00:25:30]  Good.  What do you think as far as that is?  I had reservations at one point.  Like, I didn't know.  Is it bad for the kid?  Like, you can't do a social experiment with this kid.  But after all of the horrible abuse that goes on of children in adopted homes through  straight couples, the men are beating the kids or fucking sexually abused.  There's no way fucking gays are going to do worse than straight people have done.  Hmm.  No way.  And there's no way they're going to be worse parents than fucking than so many of these 
[00:26:00]  foster homes that kids get thrown in.  So I was not sure at first.  And then when you look at just because something's not going to be worse, doesn't mean it's good  or better, though.  No, no, I understand.  But I think there'd be good parents and I'm for it.  They want it.  I'm now for it.  I was totally not sure.  But I'm.  Yeah, I'm OK with it.  Yeah, me too.  I mean, there's so many shitty parents out there.  Exactly.  As long as the people.  Right.  Oh, just. 
[00:26:30]  No, no.  It's a bigger issue.  I'm certainly with them.  It's like you got to find proper people to take in these kids is the problem.  Yeah.  Gays have to be screen like anybody else.  But yeah, the gays could be just as bad.  But the gays are not.  They don't have a history of fucking throwing their kids down fucking garbage chutes.  Look at what goes on in this.  It's like people treat kids like fucking garbage.  And here's all these kids that fall out of pussies that nobody wants.  They want them.  And they're not.  I'm sorry to scream.  They're not going to reproduce anymore.  They fucking want these kids. 
[00:27:00]  And we're telling them.  Take them.  Hmm.  All these fucking women that won't shut their stupid legs.  One.  One thing after another falling out of their cunts.  I don't want them.  Take that fucking thing and do something with it.  Obviously.  What's your take on this?  It sounds like you're not.  Sorry, I yelled.  I don't know.  Like just because there are so many bad parents and bad foster homes and bad adoptive parents  that are a man and a woman and stuff doesn't mean that.  Okay.  Since they're bad.  Well, let's just throw in another bad situation. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  I'm not sure if I wonder what kind of influence that has on the child.  If it.  And I know people go, look, you're you're born gay or you're not.  You can't be made gay.  I don't totally believe that.  I think there are two schools of gay.  I think there are other people that are born gay.  And then I think there's this almost want to be gay where you're like, I wasn't born  this way, but it looks kind of fun.  And, you know, you kind of hang out with gay people and you turn kind of, you know, gay. 
[00:28:00]  You decide to adopt the gay lifestyle.  And I wonder if that happens with with kids.  They see it.  But I know they would probably make a more tolerant.  Amen.  But but does it.  Our show reaches a lot of people are are there.  You want to go guys, girls or boys?  I bet you there's a bunch of people that listen to the show that at this point had gay parents.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good question, though.  Does it because I knew one kid who had a gay dad and a gay partner and they lived together 
[00:28:30]  and, you know, it's twenty five years ago and I would hang out with him.  And, you know, I found out some weird stuff that gone on and things that happened.  Weird stuff with the kid.  Yeah.  That I didn't know.  I was so naive back then.  I remember we got dropped off.  We were.  I was very.  I was actually.  I was way more than twenty five years ago.  Jesus Christ.  I'm forty two.  He was.  Oh, no, I was probably.  I was probably ten or eleven. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  He was in an abusive relationship.  I don't know.  An abusive house.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I never got the real details.  I was probably ten or eleven.  And I remember us going to his dad and his dad's boyfriend's friend's house to clean  the apartment.  And they would give us a few bucks and then him and the older friend went into the bedroom  and I stayed in the living room and I wasn't allowed in the bedroom.  Oh.  And I never knew.  It didn't strike me as odd that something had been going on in that bedroom. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe.  That the fucking friend was probably doing.  Not the friend that the dad lived with, but one of their dinner friends or whatever.  Yeah.  Was doing something with him.  How old was the kid?  I want to say ten or eleven.  Oh God.  Or twelve maybe.  Oh boy.  We were very young and it didn't occur to me that stuff was going on.  What's wrong with people?  I knew that the father and his friend were gay.  And I knew that their friends were gay.  But it didn't occur to me that one of their friends would do something to my buddy.  Why didn't the parents understand who this other guy was all about? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how much it extended.  I just don't know.  First of all, Opie, there was no buddy of Jimmy's.  You get what I mean?  No, it wasn't me.  Ew.  Was it you?  It's his way to deal with it.  I sat in the other room and I flogged my cock, clearing my throat, hoping the door would  open and somebody would see my hairless yet eager dick.  No, it wasn't me.  I was in the living room.  You had to just sit in the living room?  Wow. 
[00:30:30]  Your friend was getting who knows what in the room.  I don't know.  Hopefully at least he was topping.  It was a very bizarre.  And I remember years later, my buddy told me years later, he goes,  he was drunk on my porch and he said something about there had been abuse.  And I asked, did so and so have anything to do with it?  And he goes, meaning one of the people he lived with.  And he goes, he had a lot to do with it.  Oh, boy.  So I don't know if the father himself did or no. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  And he goes, I'll never forget.  He goes, the things they made me do.  Oh, Jesus.  And I said, take out the garbage.  No, but I said, I was so stupid.  He goes, the things they made me do.  And I was like, like what?  I said, like what?  Like what?  And he just didn't answer me.  I couldn't even like, even at that age, I realized what a dumb question.  Like I told my buddy after that, I told him, I can't believe I asked him like what,  but he had a tortured, uh, fucking disgusting.  Wow. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And I don't know if the dad himself was involved.  I just don't know.  But anyway, that's, you know, that's something that could have happened though.  If the father was just divorced.  In any family.  You know.  Yeah.  It does.  It happens in a lot of, you're right.  I need stats.  I don't know if there are a lot of them to be honest.  I like looking at stats.  You're a stats guy.  I'm a stats guy when it comes to anything.  I agree with that though.  I think you're born with it, but I also think that influence can make you a certain way.  Maybe if you're on the fence when you're really young, I wouldn't be surprised. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  If you grow up with two, it's cause it's almost like people who are abusive.  Well, going back to your joke, you just like traveling.  Yeah.  You become a traveler.  Maybe you just, maybe you just relocate though.  Yeah.  And you don't realize that you still have a visa to come back to America.  Shred your passport once you get there.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Right.  It's like an abuser.  I got dual citizenship.  You think that, but you're really in Europe a lot.  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I wouldn't be surprised if that had, that that does influence it more. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  Our food is here.  Why don't we take an early break today?  I like the idea of that.  So congratulations to the gees.  The gees.  Wow.  We got a lot to do.  We got a lot to do.  God damn.  Avril Lavigne's been on in her bikini for like a month.  Jeez.  And they've just been snapping pictures.  I leave a picture up as inspiration during the show.  Get you through the morning, right?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Does she have a tattoo that says fuck on her side, her left side, right?  Kind of.  No.  By her.  Really?  It looks like a tat that says fuck.  Yes, she does.  No, no.  It says fuck.  Well, suck would just be a joke.  I'm about her.  I don't know what it is.  Hey, TSA searches 95 year old woman.  It's a ridiculous story.  We'll talk about that next.  And we got an update on the feces covered porta potty peeper at a yoga festival.  We certainly do.  We got a great update on that guy. 
[00:33:30]  And as we go to break, you want to hear Bill Tetley's FUs or do you want to hear Elijah  Wood saying yeah a lot?  Talking Jimmy.  All weekend.  Which one?  Did you really?  I woke up.  Alright, then we'll do this one.  The second I woke up every day this weekend.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Couldn't stop doing it.  I know.  Way to the Christmas special.  There's no Christmas special.  You can only slow it down if you want to. 
[00:34:00]  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Then it peps up at the end.  B-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Yeah, you gotta go.  Everyone goes.  They love doing that part.  I've gotten it on Twitter a lot.  Well, with that said, listen to this.  Thanks for calling me Opie and Anthony.  F-U-Line.  Here's the latest batch of F-Ears.  Ears.  Fuck you!  Just fuck you without you.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Fuck you! 
[00:34:30]  F-U-T-K-Y-O-U Jimmy Norton.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I got a big fuck you to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy, you fucker.  Fuck you!  I'd like to send an F-U to Jim Norton for getting that stupid Bill Talley jingle stuck in my head all afternoon.  F-U-T-K-Y-O-U Jim Norton.  Fuck you!  I just wanted to give a big F-U to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley. 
[00:35:00]  Fuck you!  Whoa!  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I want to send a big F-U to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley.  Fuck you!  Please shut the fuck up.  I can fucking stand Bill Tetley.  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley, why'd you put that stupid fucking song in my head? 
[00:35:30]  F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.  Ah, fuck you, Bill Tetley.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big fuck you to Jimmy Norton for getting the B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y Bill Tetley stuck in my damn head for the last week.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!

[00:36:00]  Goddamn it, your stupid Bill Tetley fucking song.  I'm out here in the desert trying to lay a fucking pipeline.  Stupid fucking song in my head.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Call the O.B. and Anthony F-U line.  866-F-U-LINE-1.  That's 866-F-U-LINE-1.  I want to welcome E-Rock to the program this morning. 
[00:36:30]  Yes!  Oh!  Glad you made it in, E-Rock.  What happened?  D to the R.  Hello.  What happened?  I had an alarm issue.  It was my fault.  Alarm!  Alarm!  What happened to your alarm?  I didn't set the wind-up one and I guess we had a power flash because my electric clock  was like a couple hours behind.  Power flash.  What really happened?  Come on.  That's what it was.  What time did you get in?  You were here before. 
[00:37:00]  I got here at 616.  616?  Yeah.  Travis, that's not bad, right?  Well, compared to what?  Well, what time do you get here?  Oh, five.  So you don't think an hour and 15 minutes is a little...  That's not okay?  Look, we haven't brought this up in a while, but I'd say God bless E-Rock.  If this company's going to allow your tardiness, I would do the same fucking thing, man. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, absolutely.  I'm not even mad.  If you can get away with it, go for it.  No.  But I think Travis and the rest of the guys have something to say about it.  Do you guys say that it's cool we'll cover?  Well, I mean, on days where he's legitimately like, you know, I mean, I don't know if this  is legitimate, but when he's like, you know, late, late, yeah, of course, we covered.  Are you happy like every day to cover?  It's no big deal.  Are you happy?  I don't know.  He might be.  Maybe.  I ask Eric all the time to come in at an earlier hour. 
[00:38:00]  E-Rock, is that true?  That is true.  And what do you say?  Fuck you, basically.  He says, okay.  No, your actions say, fuck you.  You know that, right?  Okay.  What happened, Eric?  I'm being serious.  What time would you like him to be here, Travis?  Eric?  No.  540.  540?  Yeah.  See, that's giving him too much.  That's Eric, though.  I'm more lenient with Eric because Eric is here later than the rest of us.  Ah.  You would like him to get here at 540 and you've made that known to him many times. 
[00:38:30]  Many.  That's 20 minutes, technically, before the show starts.  Yes.  I know we do a little bullshit and stretch a little bit.  Yes.  We know we do that.  What time does he get here?  Between 540 and 550.  Oh.  Is that plenty of time to do what you have to do, E-Rock?  Usually, yeah.  That's when I get here.  Well, you're...  Yeah, yeah.  You've paid your dues.  Well, yeah, you know, I get here, I peruse the paper, look online real quick, and then  boom, we're on the air. 
[00:39:00]  I walk in as that fucking light is going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which is fine.  Yeah.  I mean, that's Jimmy Norton's way.  But, uh...  Travis, you fine with that?  With Jim coming in when the light turns on?  Yeah.  Jim can do whatever he wants.  Yeah.  No, you're fine with E-Rock's schedule?  No.  Are the bosses fine with his schedule?  No.  But they're...  What are they going to do?  Yeah, what are they really going to do?  What are they really going to do in the end?  I don't know.  What, they're going to threaten them for the hundredth time? 
[00:39:30]  These...  Whatever.  I'm not going to blow up anyone's spot.  What happened to your wind-up clock, though, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Who has a wind-up clock?  Uh-uh, E-Rock.  I usually have two alarms, yeah.  So what happened to it?  Do you have an iPhone?  Yeah, I do.  That works well.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to know the real reason.  She's overslept.  That's what I was.  I woke up in a panic, and I go, that can't be the right time.  So the same night that you didn't wind up your wind-up clock, you had a power failure?  I'm sorry. 
[00:40:00]  No.  Are you saying that's too much to happen tomorrow?  Yes!  You know what the odds of that is?  I would love to know the real reason.  The double whammy.  The double whammy.  No, it's impossible.  Really?  You could win the lottery before that.  Oh, that's right, he did.  Oh, he did.  Yes, right.  Oh, God.  You could win the lottery and had this crazy thing happen.  That's too much for one man.  It really is.  So what-  What really happened to you, Rock?  Yeah, that's what happened.  I woke up in a panic.  I saw that the time was wrong.  You decided, what the fuck, you know, it's almost a vacation kind of like weekend.  There's a vibe going on. 
[00:40:30]  There's a vibe this week because 4th of July is around the corner and said, ah, I'm going  to stretch it out a little bit.  Yeah.  So you want us to believe that your wind up clock, you forgot to wind that up and then  you had a power surge.  I didn't turn that one on because it would go off during the weekend.  So I turned it off on Friday so it doesn't go off during the weekend and I didn't turn  it back on for Monday.  Is your cable box just blinking right now or your VCR blinking?  No one has VCR.  No, the cable box had four lines across it. 
[00:41:00]  Four lines across it.  Doesn't that reboot on its own usually?  Yes.  Yes, it does.  But yours stays with four lines across it.  You're such a liar.  You think he's lying off?  Oh my God.  I do think they reboot.  Yeah, right?  Immediately.  Immediately.  E-Rock, cable boxes reboot.  Dude, I wasn't staring at the cable box.  I looked around and time was wrong.  They never stay with four lines.  It's falling apart.  Your story's falling apart.  Oh, when the cable box reboots?  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  When the power fell.  He said his stayed at four lines across.  That's impossible.  They always reboot that shit for you.  Why don't you set your iPhone?  Because I haven't even figured out the voicemail on it yet.  I haven't done it yet.  But you don't know how to use the alarm on the iPhone?  It's easy.  I haven't set it yet.  You've got a clock.  Travis, have you officially given up on getting him to get in here earlier?  Yeah, I mean, I try.  But you know, I need some help from above.  See, it doesn't matter when we're here.  No.  But the support staff is doing...  That's... 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It's really important to be here a little early and get some shit set up for us.  I love my iPhone alarm.  I do too.  It's amazing.  I usually...  Because Kenny calls me at 4.50 exactly.  Not a minute sooner, not a minute later.  So I set one alarm for 4.48.  So I'm just awake when his phone calls.  So I'm not like grabbing...  You know, I don't miss his call.  And then I have another one set for 5 a.m. 
[00:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  And that's it.  But, you know, I could set a 5, 6, 10, as many alarms as you need with the old iPhone.  It's the best.  Yeah.  But the wind-up one, does it go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick?  Is it loud?  Yeah.  And that didn't remind you to maybe pull the thing out?  Hey, can we start a new bit?  It's not.  I want a really obnoxious, like, you know, nuclear fallout type of alarm. 
[00:43:00]  No, we have that.  And I need someone to just, like, hit that button every time E-Rock comes to work.  So people can play along at home.  Oh, so they know.  Oh, so you're thinking that Eric's going to show up when the show's already on every day?  No, I mean, there's a replay before 6, right?  Oh, oh, oh.  So all of a sudden they'll hear that, eh, eh, eh.  And the listeners out there will know that E-Rock has arrived.  Can you do that for us?  I think we can do that, sure.  Yeah.  I mean, there's just some technical stuff we have to go through. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Let's try to figure that out.  That shouldn't be a problem.  All right.  Just a quick little eh, eh, eh.  And people go, oh, E-Rock showed up.  Exactly.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's my alarm.  That's my alarm, too.  You can't see through that.  No.  No.  Dude, I have the fucking...  Oath told me the Bose alarm.  I still use that?  I love the Bose alarm.  That fucking thing, you cannot...  Once in a while I fuck up and I put it on the radio, and it's not like a really...  You got it?  ...station so it won't wake me.  Ooh.  But if I remember to keep it on CD, oh, is that fucking thing allowed? 
[00:44:00]  You guys are lucky.  I never sleep to an alarm.  Hmm?  I always wake up before my alarm.  Really?  Maybe once...  Let me think about this.  Maybe once...  I can't even say a month.  Once every two months, all of a sudden I'll be surprised because also my alarm will be  going off.  I hate waking up right before the alarm.  I hate it.  Son of a bitch.  Ten minutes before your alarm.  God.  Not enough time to sleep, but...  Anything better when you wake up and you peek over at the clock, oh, please, no, no, 
[00:44:30]  no, no.  And then you see it's only like 2.30 in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Four hours.  You just turn your head back on the pillow.  Ah.  Sometimes you peek over and it's 4.50 in my case.  I'm like, fuck.  This thing's going off any second.  I slept till 7.30 last night and I knew I wouldn't sleep last night.  I just couldn't.  So I fucking dozed off for a couple hours.  I was surprised I got any sleep.  I actually got a couple hours last night.  I woke up. 
[00:45:00]  It was 5.13 a.m.  I'm like, you know what?  I'll take it.  Wow.  Two hours and 15 minutes of sleep.  Ugh.  All right, well.  You did that.  Congratulations, Z-Rock, figuring this shit out.  Yeah.  Hey, he's got it made.  Where he doesn't have to listen to anybody.  Made in the shade.  Yep.  They've all talked to him too, right?  Yes.  Every single person.  Everyone, yeah.  But why does Z-Rock say, A-Rock, what happens?  Tell us.  I want to get your point of view.  I don't want to speak for you.  There's nothing to say, Jim.  Why don't you want to be here earlier?  Yeah, what's going on?  See, I know why I have trouble sleeping, because I stay up really late. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, but-  And I look for giant clits.  No, we all-  And I jerk off, and that ruins my sleep.  What does it for you?  But we all have, like, different responsibilities with this show.  Yes.  You can show up whenever the fuck you want.  Well, as I'm before the show.  It's important for the guys that are helping us prepare the show are here a bit early.  Yeah.  Well, I'm saying, like, I know it screws me up, but I still do it sometimes.  Like, I would like to be up a little earlier.  So you're with me.  Because it was an alarm issue.  No!  Oh, thank you, Jim.  I honestly, I think you rock slept through it, which, you know, again, I've done before  too.  But I'm saying, what is it at night? 
[00:46:00]  What is it at night that gets you?  Because I know a lot of times at night what gets me.  It's hard to not do it.  Uh-huh.  I'm watching fucking Game of Thrones or whatever the fuck I'm doing.  Yeah.  So for you, what is it at night?  Because obviously you don't go to bed early enough.  Oh, I'm laying in bed.  I watch news, watch TV, and I go to sleep.  There's the problem.  You have to watch in the other room.  Simpsons.  Animation Animaniacs.  Animaniacs.  Ghostbusters.  Ghostbusters animation.  Fuck, Danny beat me to it.  Damn it!  The real Ghostbusters cartoon.  Not that fake-ass shit. 
[00:46:30]  He-Man.  He-Man.  Alright, so, that's why.  E-Rox didn't wind up on the clock.  No, he didn't wind up the clock.  No, he didn't pull the little thing out.  And had a power surge all in the same night.  Did the cuckoo bird die?  Oh.  Was there a new Metalocalypse on last night?  What's a Metalocalypse?  The next one.  Oh, boy.  Do you watch that?  No, I don't watch that one.  Venture Brothers, right?  Yes. 
[00:47:00]  I would do exactly what E-Rox is doing, though.  Why wouldn't you?  We all would.  Of course.  If you have a boss that has no power, of course you would do this.  Of course.  But we all could.  We just don't.  No, I know.  I mean, we just don't.  Well, here, out of respect for the other guys in the, quote, support staff arena, you wouldn't.  Exactly.  But if you had a boss that's powerless like we do, of course you would do this.  Yeah, E-Rox figured it out.  Speaking of which, interns.  Jimmy said, remind me about interns.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  I try not to.  We're still talking about the fact we don't have interns.  Yeah.  How many days has it been without interns?  We need to start that bit, too.  Ooh.  Wow.  It's been a long time.  What?  It was December, I guess?  So around middle of December is about when they would have checked out?  Yeah.  So we're.  So we're.  Oh, six months ago.  Yeah.  Christmas.  Half Christmas was over the weekend.  Six months.  It's been six months without interns, basically.  And I normally don't, you know, start the intern thoughts. 
[00:48:00]  I don't usually think of them until there's something I need done.  And what I need it done, we have to figure something out because we have Linda Hogan coming  in tomorrow, Hulk's ex-wife or whatever, and she has a book out.  So what I like to do, I mean, I'm silly like that, but I like to read the book or as much  as I can to get notes for the fucking interview.  Right.  I like to have at least, I like to have maybe 12 questions, 15 questions.  Sure.  A lot of times you don't need them.  Yeah, but just to have them.  But just to have them in case, you know, like with Sugar Ray Leonard, I like to, I'm 
[00:48:30]  glad I read his book first because it helped.  So I would read the book.  So, uh, Roland a lot of times will drop the book off for me, which is great.  It's not his job to fucking come up to him, but he lives kind of close and he'll be a  buddy and drop it.  But he couldn't this weekend.  So I, the book came in Friday afternoon and it sat there until this morning.  It's here.  I'm sorry.  The book came here.  So it's like all 72 hours.  I could have been reading this fucking book preparing for this fucking interview. 
[00:49:00]  And it's like, I can't, I'm doing red eye tonight.  So I'll read a little bit of this book, but I'm going to be unprepared for a fucking interview  tomorrow.  And I'm annoyed.  I hate being unprepared for an interview.  I hate it.  Cause it feels stupid.  Amateurish.  So there, Hulk had muscles.  Go.  You know, do you want to go on a honeymoon?  Go.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  Why?  Cause I didn't have the book for three days.  And we have a messenger service here, which we don't have, we don't have access to. 
[00:49:30]  So I want to ask anybody, how am I supposed to get this book?  Um, when, I mean, I could come back for it, but is that my only option to come back for  it?  I mean, come on.  I'm not trying to be a prima donna.  I want to read the book.  So I give a fucking, I would like to find out stuff in here.  So I could, what else is the use?  Steve O brought the book in day of.  Yeah.  Flava Flav, whose book was excellent, brought the book in. 
[00:50:00]  He handed it to us at the interview.  Yeah.  Idiot that he is.  Cause I would have fucking raved about the book.  Had I read it before.  Yeah.  Are we, are we sure that we're broadcasting to people?  I don't know, dude.  Cause we do the same break.  Now I'm with the haters.  We do the same break every week, but I'm telling the reason we do is cause we want  things to change.  Yeah.  We, we need interns for this high profile radio show or anybody.  We got our staff that is really important to us running out to get a stupid coffee and  omelets because we don't have interns to do the, the, the bullshit work anymore. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  The crap.  It's like, it's unbelievable.  There's nothing worse than a lagging interview or missing certain things that could have,  even if she's great and fun to talk to, there's certain things you'd like to hit on  because you'd fucking, they're interesting points in the book.  Yeah.  And are you going to have interns at, um, live at the compound?  At the compound.  Uh, are you going to have an intern program?  I should have an intern program there.  Definitely.  Oh, I know.  And I could ask her tomorrow.  Young girls. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Linda, there's a picture of you and the Hulkster holding a surfboard and he's wearing kind  of a straw hat.  Did, uh, did he get burned that day?  Go, go, go.  How tall is that surfboard?  If you don't mind me asking.  Ah, please do exactly this tomorrow.  Ah, please do this tomorrow.  It seems that she's trying to put pictures of the Hulk where he looks like an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, uh, I want to ask her about the allegations that the warrior brought up. 
[00:51:30]  Oh God.  Good about her having, uh, you know, sex and a lot of people, sex and Hulk taking her around.  You know, he's making some pretty serious allegations there.  And, and what's her response there?  There, there's my question.  I did my show prep.  Nice.  I'm done.  So I, that's how I roll.  No, I don't, I want to say it on the air, but it's better if I don't, I'll show it to  you.  Oh, okay.  Unzip.  All right.  You can read this out loud. 
[00:52:00]  It just says black cock.  Black cock.  It was on my mind.  All right.  I can write it too.  I can write it too.  It's wrong with you.  Hold on.  I've done it.  Um, but, um, tomorrow, is that possible?  Uh, we've, we've looked for that.  And it can't get it.  It can't get it.  Okay.  What are we talking about?  Let me see.  I was asking if we could, I passed that along to, to Sweetie Pie.  I don't want to say it out loud.  Just in case we can pull it off.  I won't.  Right.  But I mean, would that be a, let me see. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know if we can do it.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  That's crazy.  I better destroy this.  Yes.  But that'd be a, I just don't want to say it.  Have somebody, uh, call, call from her camp and go, don't do that.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  You can't do that.  I love it.  It's not, it's, it's not as easy to find as some other people.  Really?  Yeah.  Um, but I would like to be able to conduct a fucking interview again.  If, if she comes in and it's just free flowing, a lot of times that happens.  Fine. 
[00:53:00]  But I would like to be prepared for fucking interviews.  Yeah.  How am I supposed to get a book?  Oh, you know, we, we tried it.  We, we went through the proper channels and basically told these people that, you know,  it's affecting the show, not having interns, but they don't give a fuck.  Is there anybody?  When are we having interns?  Is there anybody that they would get from the message center?  We don't even know at this point.  To do it.  Yeah.  What happened to the, we're making progress, which was told to us three to four months ago.  Ah, Bill Tetley.  All right, whatever.  We'll move on.  There's just no, um, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  We'll move on.  No problem.  By the way, you can't meet today, Ant.  I'm sorry.  What happened?  I can't, uh, do that meeting today.  Oh.  Can't do it.  Yeah?  What are you, what are you going on?  Uh, I'm getting my hair cut.  Haircut?  And I can prove that, uh, tomorrow when my hair is a lot shorter.  Well, that's true.  So they, so they can't just say.  They can't yell at me for making up something.  It's not like you saying you didn't, uh, set your alarm clock.  The boss is desperately, the boss is desperately trying to meet with me and Ant.  And it always starts as like, no, I just want to see where you guys are at.  And then it turns into a yelling session. 
[00:54:00]  And I ain't doing that.  Not today.  I got to get my hair cut.  Get them all cut.  Yeah.  And it'll be proof tomorrow when my hair is shorter.  I just want to keep it quick.  Huh?  I just want to keep it quick.  Oh, have fun.  I'll sit in the air.  Have fun with that.  And then I'll just like.  It always starts with that.  No, man.  Just kind of, we just want to see where we're all at.  And the next thing you know, he's bitching about something.  All right.  Get the fuck out of here.  That ain't happening today. 
[00:54:30]  I gotta get my hair cut.  By the way, seeing Dwight Gooden got really fat.  Oh, my God.  Didn't he?  Seeing David Wells and Doc Gooden in those old timer.  Isn't that so fucked up?  It's so sad, man.  I know, right?  For your own life.  You feel older.  Yeah, they have the old timer game.  Damn it.  Jeter will be there.  I remember when Jeter was talked about as a hot prospect before.  Jeter.  He fucking played.  And then all of a sudden this kid, Derek Jeter.  I went to school with a kid named Charlie Jeter.  Who I don't know if there's any relation or not. 
[00:55:00]  But I remember thinking of Charlie whenever I would hear this kid's name.  Who is this?  Derek Jeter.  I think a few years have to go by before you can start doing old-timers games, though.  How many years for them?  What is it?  I thought it was 25 years, but that's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  No.  If Jeter, let's say, retired this year, he could be in the old-timers game next year.  Oh, okay.  But a lot of these players that really are some of the big names, they kind of wait a  while before they make that turn.  How many years from Wells and Gooden left the Yankees, though? 
[00:55:30]  It's a long 10 years.  Yeah.  Is it 10 years?  Something like that.  Joe Torre hasn't been a Yankee in four already.  Wow.  Four years.  At least he had a baseball.  Gooden was so fat.  Yeah.  They said he's thinner than last year, though.  Wow.  Yeah, he's in a world of hurt, man.  He could have been the greatest pitcher of all time, but fucking drugs.  He loves his drugs.  It's the fucking perfect game, though.  I have no idea.  Idiot.  Loves them drugs.  Look at all his mug shots.  He's got a massive potbelly, right?  Is he better now, though?  Is he still getting higher? 
[00:56:00]  He did celebrity rehab.  I don't think he's doing coke.  So I'm sure Dr. Drew, you know, cured him and everybody else that he's got on this season.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure of it.  He's good that way.  Dr. Drew.  I got Dr. Drew talking all the time about the Casey Anthony trial.  He's always on that headline news channel talking about if she's, you know, mental, psychopath.  What's his take on it?  Egomaniac.  Oh, yeah.  He's got it classified as a kook.  Hey, sir.  I like Dr. Drew. 
[00:56:30]  You like Dr. Drew?  Yeah.  I see the arguments against him, too, but I like him.  There's some woman on that channel.  Who is that bitch?  Her voice is hilarious.  I come back from the trial and she's like, I really think that the defense did a great  job.  Oh, my.  She sounds like the Martian, Marvin the Martian from Bugs Bunny.  What's her name?  I can't remember her name, but she, it's, I was looking it up on the headline news website. 
[00:57:00]  It's, it's, it's so distracting to hear her talk.  Oh, you saw the prosecution do a good job that time.  What?  It's distracting.  Yeah.  Big week, I guess, for that whole thing.  Why?  I think the defense is going to wrap up on Thursday, they were saying, and then it'll go  to the jury.  There was a big controversy on Saturday. 
[00:57:30]  They were supposed to do a day on Saturday, the trial.  And then the judges said, nope, everyone leave.  Everyone leave.  We're in recess.  So something was going on.  They think maybe Casey's changing lawyers or a lot of people might as well speculate  maybe a deal was cut or something.  What do you think the deal was she pleased guilty to manslaughter?  Maybe something like that.  Or negligent homicide.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Criminally negligent homicide.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Uh, but I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, we'll find out today.  I'm, I'm, you know, I'm fully involved, fully engrossed.  Are you going to find out today?  Well, we'll find out why.  I think we'll find out why it was recessed.  Oh, okay.  And then, uh, if it goes to schedule Thursday, they'll probably arrest the defense.  They'll get through the closing arguments.  And then it goes to the jury and the, see what happens.  I think they scored pretty good though.  The defense, uh, on, uh, Friday looked pretty good. 
[00:58:30]  The, uh, the brother's there crying and she's there crying.  The mother's crying.  They're all fucked up.  They had pictures too of the, the girl.  The grandmother was guiding her like, like had her arms on the side of her, but the kid  was able to walk up those pool steps by herself.  Hmm.  That's what they're saying.  The defense is claiming that she fell in the pool and she drowned.  And then, uh, they, you know, disposed of the body and covered it up. 
[00:59:00]  Are they admitting that she did that?  Uh, yeah, that's what, that's one of the stories that the defense is coming up with.  They're just trying to cast as much doubt with the jury as possible.  Like, Hey, here's a viable story that could have happened.  Right.  Uh, the defense doesn't have to prove that.  Right, right, right.  They just have to, you know, get a juror or two to say, yeah, that's viable.  Shadow of a reasonable doubt.  That's it.  Not even a reasonable doubt.  The shadow.  You have to be guilty beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt in a criminal case.  She's just enough for a juror to go, look, what the prosecution said, there are some 
[00:59:30]  holes in it.  The defense said this, I, it's, it's a viable option.  So yeah, she's guilty of being irresponsible.  She's guilty of being a horrid, irresponsible, lying sack of shit.  You know, being a parent, we're very responsible, but all of a sudden we'll both look up and  go, where, where's the kid?  And we've only took our eyes off him for five seconds and he's already in another room 
[01:00:00]  getting into craziness, right?  Oh, geez.  But if you're really irresponsible, hell yeah, this kid is wandering around and falling into  pools.  Fuck yeah.  Into the pool.  And now the kid dies and now you got to cover it up because you're panicking.  Now, I don't know if she, in her case, killed her and killed the kid or not.  I don't know.  I think, I don't think she killed the kid.  I don't know if the.  I think it's a cover up because of her irresponsibilities.  Could be.  Could be the fact that she was drugging the kid to go out and you know, didn't have a babysitter 
[01:00:30]  and would just drug the kid.  Maybe OD'd it.  Not with the intention of killing the kid.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Something like that.  But, uh, we have people talking about the duct tape around the kid's mouth.  Uh, you know, that's maybe a cover up to make it look like something.  I don't know.  If the kid falls in the pool and drowns, you fucking, you try to get help.  You don't deny the kid's missing for third one.  Stop it.  Exactly.  Well, yeah.  You don't put tape on the fucking kid's mouth.  What is it? 
[01:01:00]  The fucking, is there a, well, I saw a moth down the throat.  The chrysalis or a pupa.  Pupa.  So, yeah, maybe the cover up is because too many Xanax.  Could she kill this?  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  No.  So the kid, she, she wanted to drug the kid so she could do whatever, you know, she's  a party girl.  Kid fucking dies because there's too much Xanax.  Now you're like, fuck, they're going to discover the Xanax.  So now I got to make believe the kid drowned.  Yeah.  And, uh, and then, and then disposing of the body and having really nothing left of 
[01:01:30]  it except bones made it very hard to do any kind of toxicology.  And so, um, I don't know.  I think she's got a great chance of, uh, getting off on the first degree.  Oh yeah.  She's not going to be to death, but you read some people and they're just like, Oh, she's  going to be getting the needle.  No.  Friday is my big day for trolling.  I like doing all my trolling on Friday and boy, did I get a lot of people.  Oh, I mean, I know it means when you purposely annoying online. 
[01:02:00]  Okay.  That's pretty much it.  And, uh, it's just troll face.  It's just, uh, it's so easy cause there are these housewives that are totally, uh, obsessed  with this trial and have a deep hatred of Casey Anthony cause their moms themselves.  And, you know, uh, they, they sympathize with the child and to then start talking about  how they're just jealous women of, of Casey's beauty and how those, those bright blue eyes 
[01:02:30]  could never do anything wrong.  And they don't even see the sarcasm.  They're just like, you're sick.  You're disturbed.  She murdered her child.  I go, or they're talking about like, Oh, those are real tears.  I go, they are real tears.  She lost her child.  Have some sympathy.  Like lost her child.  She killed her own daughter.  I go, could you kids get into things?  They get into trouble. 
[01:03:00]  They hate it.  Yeah.  They really are.  Enraging.  You're so much fun.  Defensive.  This one awful.  So much fun to do.  A lot of those women are mental as well.  Yeah.  I know a lot of, I know a lot of parents and they're not sitting around watching the dumb trial.  They're just not.  And you see their amount of tweets and it's, it's in the tens of thousands and they tweet  about the trial.  What are they using?  Twitter as a chat room?  Yeah, pretty much.  Getting in a fucking chat room.  It's like 40 seconds, a minute, 10.  Wow. 
[01:03:30]  Two minutes.  Like they're, they're constantly tweeting everything that's going on in the trial.  Did you see the judge scratch his nose?  Did you see?  Oh, there she is again with her tissue.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  It's fun to watch though.  Do you know what I watched?  I'm into it.  Which I Twittered about.  Oh.  And I, I just, I, you, I was watching Carol Burnett clips the other night.  Nothing wrong with that.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  Lucy was great. 
[01:04:00]  Carol Burnett is just the funniest woman ever.  Ever.  Yeah.  I think Sarah Silverman's great.  There's so many fucking Carol Burnett is the, is the, I watched the Eunice Gong show  two part clip with fucking Harvey Korman playing her awful husband and Vicki Lawrence playing  that cunt mother.  And this is, I'm guessing 1971.  So content wise, you're very limited on what you could do on a network sketch show.  Yeah.  No sexual innuendo.  She was just a funny fucking broad Carol Burnett. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  She still is Jimmy.  She's still with us.  I don't think she's performing anymore.  Well, she's funny in her everyday life.  I'm sure.  I don't know.  She's probably cracking them up at the drugstore.  She's getting her pills.  Getting her old person pills.  Right.  Eunice, the sitcom was not great, but Eunice on the Carol Burnett show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh God.  Was she fucking great.  The sitcom was stinkeroo.  But when they did the bit on the show, it was really funny. 
[01:05:00]  Do you think she's still pulling at her earlobes?  No, I think that woman's dead that she was pulling her earlobe for.  Was it a grandmother or something?  No, it was a good night.  No, I want to say it was for her kids.  No, was it for a woman?  I think it was her grandma or some shit.  Yeah, but she still had to pull her stupid earlobe and I bet you that she walks around  the world.  Oh, she's got to do that.  Hey, tug your earlobe.  Yeah.  Do you know when I was a kid, we were in like fourth grade, third grade, and we had  to do a like almost Pictionary, a contest of, what do you call it when you do those content 
[01:05:30]  when you act it out and they try to?  Oh, charades.  Charades.  And, you know, you pull your ear, it sounds like.  So, I was just standing there and I just kept pulling my ear.  And the teacher would go, sounds like.  And I would go, no.  And I just kept pulling my ear because my name was Cal Burnett.  I just kept pulling my ear.  And she thought it was sounds like.  Everyone thought it was sounds like.  But it was just Cal Burnett.  So, why don't you try to do something different? 
[01:06:00]  I did do something that was different because everybody else was doing their earlobe.  No, but when they weren't getting the whole earlobe thing, why did you try not to?  I loved it.  I loved the fact that it was Carol.  Did they ever get that it was Carol Burnett?  Oh, okay.  I don't remember that part of it.  I was so young.  But I remember the time.  Remember she would take audience questions?  Yeah, yeah.  And the fuck, they would always ask her to do that dumb Tarzan call.  Oh, yeah.  She was funny, man.  But yeah, they'd turn up the lights and you'd see that audience.  It's like, oh, they're all dead now.  Dude, when she was singing feelings as Eunice, it's just great. 
[01:06:30]  It's awful.  But that's why she was great.  She didn't try to be fucking cute.  She was guy funny because she had a guy mentality.  Yeah.  She didn't mind looking like an asshole.  People always say women aren't funny.  Women are funny when they're not afraid of looking like assholes.  Yeah.  When they're trying to be really beautiful, go fuck yourself.  Or too cool.  Or too cute or too cool.  But when they're not afraid, when they're willing to put a lampshade on their head like 
[01:07:00]  a guy would and just look like an asshole.  Be an ass.  Then they're funny.  Hey, you know, Dick Clark used to grab his ass when he would like on bloopers, bleeps  and blunders or whatever it is.  He'd go good night and he'd turn around and they'd walk away.  Him and Dick Clark, I guess, or whatever the fuck.  Dick Clark, Ed McMahon.  Right.  And Dick Clark would like grab his ass cheek and squeeze it.  Is that his tribute to Merv Griffin?  Yeah.  Is that real?  Yeah.  Every episode.  Why? 
[01:07:30]  Why would he do that?  That was his little thing.  Like, Carol Burnett had the ear thing and he had the rear thing.  Right.  Yeah.  Dick Clark ass grab.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  It was like on the blooper show.  He would do that all the time.  All right.  Hey, you want the port-a-potty update?  Port-a-potty.  Actually, you know more about this than me.  I heard it on the news.  They, I guess, talked to him and he fessed up. 
[01:08:00]  Well, they caught him, first of all, right?  Yeah.  Harper confesses to spying at Yoga Fest.  This guy, Luca Crisco, 30, a lanky local wing nut and a sparring new age gigolo in Boulder,  Colorado, admitted he crept into the basin of a portable toilet during a yoga festival earlier  this month to spy on women.  He's got some downwood poop.  This guy rules.  I was doing a little bit of yoga and I'm just seeing all these goddesses. 
[01:08:30]  That's what he said.  Crisco said during a jailhouse interview.  It seems crazy, but I just felt like I was being blessed by their energy.  The peeping John admitted to watching several women before getting caught.  At one point, hopping from an unused toilet to a busy one in order to catch more women  during private moments.  A busy one?  A busy turlet.  They write, and it's in quotations, a busy one.  That means one that had a lot of turds being there. 
[01:09:00]  A lot of shit.  A lot of yoga shits.  Yeah, yoga shits take long shits too.  It's probably like snake central on that joint.  Snake central.  Snake central.  It's probably like snake central on that joint.  I said snake central.  Let's slow down the story.  So he's in one port-a-john getting really mad because none of them are using it.  Yeah, but it's cleaner.  So he's like, fuck, I got to get to the busy one.  I got to get right into the shit.  So he went to the busy one in order to catch more women during private moments. 
[01:09:30]  Probably had one big fat one sit down on the empty one and just do nothing but cut those loud farts.  And he was hoping for a really, a yogi goddess.  A yoga goddess.  But instead a big fatso who's doing her first yoga thing.  She probably worked at the fucking, at the hot dog, but she worked at the fucking, the hemp hat booth.  Yes. 
[01:10:00]  And she sat down and dropped a liquidy evacuation.  He was hoping for a hot yogi to fucking drop like a fucking snake shit on his head.  A Carville ice cream snake duty.  Instead the fucking fat hemp sock salesman lady sat down.  And it echoed in the thing all loud.  His ears hurt.  And people understand he was in the tank, right?  Yeah.  He was in the tank.  In the basin.  It's self.  It's a, it's a, it's yeah.  That's where the shit falls, right? 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Yeah.  People do understand that.  Where else would he be?  I don't know.  Maybe behind the porridge on.  Oh no.  Into some kind of hole that he fucking maybe drilled.  No, he was in the, in the, in the shit tank.  In the shit tank.  Where the duties go.  Crisco said he'd been a serial peeper for years and insisted that the latest spying session  wasn't as stomach turning as it seemed.  Really?  Yes.  We've all been in a, in a, in a port-a-john.  Animals.  Uh, there's bacteria in there, but to me, it's just normal.  We all have bodily fluids. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  We all have bodily fluids.  So just, uh, you know, lay down and piss and shit.  So you could see maybe a pussy.  It's an asshole shitting.  It seems terrible, but it didn't actually smell that bad or anything.  That's get the fuck out of here.  You're lying.  I still would have done it.  I would have done it even if it smelled a little weird because where there is muck,  there is gold.  He said.  There's muck.  There's gold.  That should be on a t-shirt.  That guy's perv switch just went off so bad.  Looking at them yoga chicks.  Oh yeah.  In their yoga pants. 
[01:11:30]  Where he crawled into the basin.  How'd he get in that thing?  I guess he went right into the fucking toilet part.  Oh, he's a yoga guy.  So he probably could get into any.  He probably could get into some, uh, some position.  Yeah.  He, he sat there in the full Lotus position.  Yeah.  Looking up as they just shat upon him.  Uh, he was stopped in Vail Thursday for panhandling and was arrested after cop noticed he matched  the description.  His, uh, his perf switch just went off.  He was looking at the yoga chicks in their yoga pants. 
[01:12:00]  And you know how you could see like fucking like pussy bulge and everything.  And he was looking going like, that's not good enough to do.  I gotta see their pussy.  Can I tell you what I came to last night?  It's funny.  You say that.  It was a video of a woman.  This gives you a clips for sale.com is the best.  And she was a really kind of weird Russian woman.  And her, I put camel toe in the search engine and I fucking lucked up on this woman who  had on tight pants and like, they were like spandex and she was talking about it. 
[01:12:30]  So I went somewhere else and I got one of her clips of her bare pussy and pantyhose.  You can kind of see it.  And she was mushing it through these black spandex pants.  Like how fat her, you couldn't even see her pussy.  And she was like, look at how fat it is.  My pussy is so fat.  And I fucking, I blurked one all over my stomach.  I was on my sofa.  I knew I wasn't going to sleep.  It's two 40.  I fucking blurka blurka.  I had my fucking, my, my law, my legs out on my ottoman, my computers on my left. 
[01:13:00]  And she looked at how fat my pussy is.  My pussy.  And my fucking, my dick just threw up all over my fat belly.  Potato flakes all over my fat stomach.  Potato flakes.  She's wonderful.  That's sort of similar to the video I made yesterday.  Did you see the yoga broad in the park yet?  No.  She was doing a spread eagle with her pink panties.  Ooh.  Ew.  In front of a million families in Central Park yesterday?  No, I didn't see. 
[01:13:30]  Was it, uh...  She pretty?  It's my latest video.  Was she hot?  She was Asian.  Oh.  It's so hard to find a big vagina for Pete's sakes.  Man.  But you gotta see this.  She does, she does a split and she has black pants on that are worn, are wearing a little,  uh, thin.  And she's got, uh, she's got pink panties on.  Look at this thing.  What are you doing this bitch?  They're doing...  I'm just sitting there with my kid.  Yay!  Like a circus act.  Sure. 
[01:14:00]  Now she's doing some weird, like, spinning yoga trick.  I love yoga chicks, man.  I love their bulging badges and long, lean muscles.  You already see the pink...  Look at these pink panties!  This is full of families and kids!  Are you sure she doesn't have a fucking period?  Wow.  Oh, nice zoom!  Fucking...  Fucking nice zoom, dude.  And then she presents her pussy to the whole park!  How wonderful of her.  How lucky did I get yesterday?  Oh, look at that pussy!  She's wearing a tiny pink thong that you could see clear as day as she does this yoga split 
[01:14:30]  in the air, being held up by another yoga person.  Wow.  Wow.  People are dumb.  Looks like she's making shoes out of her phone.  I'll zoom in again.  Don't you worry.  Here comes Sisu.  This is the cunt cam.  Look at that!  Yeah.  How great is that, Jimmy?  Phenomenal.  With a yoko face.  And her face is horrendous.  She's just presenting her pussy to the sun in the park yesterday. 
[01:15:00]  And the other woman is flipping her around with her feet.  The main role is just being stupid.  But, uh...  Jesus.  How do you do that in front of families and kids?  They don't care.  Dumb hippie fucking broads.  You could see her pussy, right, Jimmy?  I couldn't see the balls because the panties were so pronounced.  I like a nice, tight spandex material or something like that where the vagina... 
[01:15:30]  Is pushing out.  But, like, we're almost where...  You want the vagina to be bubbling a little bit.  I know her whole life was filled with humiliating explanations as it came out.  Like, look, somebody didn't just hit this with a shovel.  It's always like this.  I love it.  Back to the yoga guy.  But, yeah, I got lucky with that video yesterday.  That's fantastic.  Holy shit.  What's going on there?  Oh, there you go.  A hell of a camel toe.  It looks like she was punched in the vagina. 
[01:16:00]  Look at how big that vag is.  That might be an awful one, though.  You never know.  Sometimes when it's too Simpson mouth, it's not as good as you think it's going to be.  I like it not just to be long, stupid, dopey lips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, back to this guy in Boulder.  So, where were we?  Panhandling...  Okay.  All right.  Literally collared at the Hanuman Yoga Festival on June 17th after a woman noticed something  moving in the toilet and grabbed the security guard. 
[01:16:30]  After allegedly locking himself inside, he suddenly burst out and fled on foot covered  in feces.  Just burst out of there.  Covered in shit.  And he did the run for freedom.  It's like that's getting on the elevator every day.  Yes.  Crisco told Boulder's Daily Camera that he starts spying on women while traveling through  Europe several years ago.  Oh, God.  You know those European assholes with long hairs on them?  I'll bet you this shit would fall down. 
[01:17:00]  It'd look like the fucking Donkey Kong barrel rolling.  Getting caught in the ass hairs.  Or they would take a piss and leave that fucking...  A little spit curl on their long pubes because the piss hit it.  He and some friends went to a recreation center...  50's hairdo.  He and some friends went to a recreation center in France where he snuck into the girls' locker 
[01:17:30]  room and hid inside a broken vent.  Now, that sounds kind of cool.  This guy is a...  At least you don't get...  You're not going to have feces on you if you're hiding in a vent.  Nah, that's fine.  In a women's locker room.  Jesus, Danny had a big fat woman.  Look at that big fat black woman right there.  What is going on with her pussy?  Let me see.  Let's see, Jimmy.  Do you see anything in this picture?  This is so disgusting.  Let's see.  What do we got going on?  Oh, yeah.  That big fatso.  Moose knuckle. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Come on.  That's a pussy ass.  I don't know what that is.  That's way too big.  I look good.  Camel toe.  Camel toe.  Camel toe.  God, I love...  Fuck it.  It melts me on a visceral level when I see a fat...  Yeah.  There's something so animal...  You like smacking it?  No.  What I like to do, you silly goose, is I like to smell it.  I like to brush my nose on it really gently.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  And they like that, because it's like you're not going right in.  And I like to...  Because those type of pussies drool.  They drool.  Dude, they drool.  They're amazing.  And the more weight they lose, you can't lose weight down there.  So anything better than an anorexic chick with a meat bag?  Big meaty one.  Big meat bag.  Exactly.  Let her fucking puke up the macaroni and put her giant twat on your nose.  They get thinner and thinner, and that just gets puffier and puffier down there.  They're puffier down there.  Yeah, it's great.  Looks like they have a horse saddle strapped to them. 
[01:19:00]  All right, let's get back to this creep.  So he was in France, girls' locker room.  All right, you know, come on.  You're not getting duty on you that way.  These chicks started showing up that I never had a chance with,  so now he's back at the yoga festival where he got caught.  But I figured at least I could see them change or something.  Oh.  I've come to know how interesting they are.  Ugh.  Cops in Boulder believe he's been watching women in bathrooms all over town,  and they have been telling local businesses to check for peepholes. 
[01:19:30]  What a ghoul.  He also ran several porn websites out of a hostel he was living in  and advertised his services as a male escort.  Alternatively, using the...  Oh, his names were Sky Orion or Bunny Man.  Bunny Man?  Yeah.  Jesus.  This guy's hopping around a bunch of shit or something.  He certainly is.  Just keep firing him out.  I got to keep hitting him back.  He's now admitting the portable toilet incident was a dumb idea. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  But it didn't mean any harm.  Didn't mean any harm.  Didn't he realize that is, like, harm?  Like, girls feel fucking violated from that.  Why would you feel violated?  A chick with a fucking guy in a toilet.  You know, chicks are different than guys.  Like, if you start pissing and saw some girl's face in the toilet,  wouldn't you just start laughing and pissing in a mouth like that clown game  where you got to pop the balloon?  Dude, I would laugh my ass off.  And I hold out hope to women out there that they just find this ridiculous and laugh too. 
[01:20:30]  But they're all, you know, they're different.  Because every time they show, like, a scene in a movie where you got kind of a flasher.  Yeah.  They always have to show the woman screaming and running.  And I think most New York women would laugh at that.  What are you doing?  Remember the redheaded Irish broad?  Oh, yeah.  Laid into that guy.  Laid into the guy that was...  You fucking pervert.  You fucking asshole.  Well, I would like to think more women are like that than getting freaked out and running away from it. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I'd rather put a gun to my head than scare anyone or hurt anyone, he said.  Well, then you should put a gun to your head because you were scaring or hurting people.  He was just helping a poop come out.  He was just watching a poop.  Just can't take it.  He diddle.  With one finger on her asshole.  She has no idea what's happening.  She felt the pooping corkscrewed out by hand.  Like a light bulb he's taking out.  He's helping the doodos come out.  A shit light bulb. 
[01:21:30]  Because he didn't want it to be broken.  He wanted that whole lot...  He wanted the shit to be so long that when his hand went up, it slid past his palm and tickled his wrist.  And then he wanted to put it on his head.  Why is she walking down the hall like that?  She's checking herself out in the mirror.  Well, she's a woman.  That's what women do.  No, man.  You see that, Ed?  Yeah.  That was a different walk.  I don't know.  She's got like heels on and a skirt and shit.  But she's kind of like wiggling her hips as she walks down the hall. 
[01:22:00]  Her hands was wiggling too.  Yeah.  And that's a mad act.  And then she was checking herself out in the glass to her right.  Yeah.  She's got high heels on and a short skirt.  It's the black chick from Shade over there.  Is she an intern?  I think so.  She's an intern.  They even have interns.  Isn't that great?  I would like some help.  It doesn't have to be at this moment, but I want to lease a car and I want car shopping.  No, you can't do that.  Oh.  And I would like a dealer because I don't know what they... 
[01:22:30]  How do you know the best deal you can get?  Like, how do you know when you're leasing?  I lease this.  I think it's 100% right off because of my job.  I literally only use it for work.  Yeah.  I would like to have details on leasing.  I'm just not good at it.  I don't...  Like, they quote your prices.  They go, eh, that's the fee.  Like, I want to lease a nice car.  I lease a BMW now, which I like, but I'm...  Yeah.  You know?  And I'd like to know what the fucking dealers know.  They're all gonna, you know...  But if you talk to... 
[01:23:00]  I don't want to talk to somebody who's gonna help me get a car.  I want to talk to somebody who can fucking help me.  Who knows the tricks.  Yeah.  What's their game?  I don't know.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  You're right.  Because you walk in and you go, look what...  I wanted to fucking...  I looked at Mercedes.  I think it's just beyond my price range to lease that even.  I mean, I can't spend that much on a lease.  I can't do it.  But the guy's like...  It's like 800 bucks just to fucking join the lease.  He goes, I had to charge that there.  I'm like, what do you mean?  Just to open the lease?  Like, where's that?  Yeah, what is that? 
[01:23:30]  Where does that come from?  What is that?  I don't get it.  For what?  And then you terminate the lease at the end and you don't want to re-up with them?  It's an extra 500?  Fuck you, Mercedes.  It's a great car, but come on, rate me.  Yeah, that's what they do.  I'm sure every dealership has the same type of...  That's what I'm saying, but you can get a lot of those taken off and I want to know  which ones.  Oh, I gotcha.  You know what I mean?  Like, that's the type of shit...  Let's say your best friend was a car dealer.  He'd go with you and go, no, take that off, take that off.  Let me see that paper.  Eh, off, done.  You could do it for this. 
[01:24:00]  And you'd go, eh, thanks a lot.  That's a smart guy.  But that's a guy who knows.  I don't know.  I try to look like I know.  I'm like, yeah, but what about...  What about that thing over there?  What if the wheels get stolen?  You know, I never know what to ask for.  He's never done this before, but...  He's gonna take $100 off of that true coat.  Yeah, and I understand that they have a living to make.  Fucking asshole.  And they gotta make money, but...  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm sure someone will come forward and help you out, Jimmy. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know how to do car dealer stuff.  All right.  You gotta be one of those guys that just know how to go in there and talk to car dealers  and be like, no, I'm not doing that.  Buddy.  Yeah, you gotta know how to go in there and go, really?  No.  No, no, no.  No.  Here's his sign here initially.  No.  What am I signing this for?  Well, that's the fee.  He goes, no, wipe that fee off.  Wipe that off.  And they go, okay.  Well, they still have hidden fees, so they still make their money.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:25:00]  That's not true.  They do make the money, and I'm for them making the money, but when they charge me  way more money than I know I should probably...  That's when it, like...  We're not a bank, Jimmy.  It's like, even when you get sent, like, I got sent to a serious, you know, got me  the name of somebody I could talk to, and you know, I think that they would take care  of it.  It's an expensive car.  It's just too much for me to lease.  All right, here we go.  He's been in the business for 10 years.  Andy?  In the business. 
[01:25:30]  Let's learn a little bit about the car business, Andy.  What do you got?  Hi, Andy.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Listen.  Just go into the dealership, and don't act like you're leasing the fucking thing.  Just say, I want to buy this car.  I want to buy it for, say, 500 under invoice.  Make them show you the invoice.  They show you the invoice.  Say you pay invoice for it.  That's about as good as you're going to get.  There's got to be a rebate, okay? 
[01:26:00]  So you take the rebate, and then when the guy says, well, you know, how are you going  to pay for this?  Say, well, I thought about leasing it.  Well, then he's already locked into his price, and you stuck it to him.  Throw him.  So ask for the invoice?  Ask for the invoice.  Say, listen, I need the invoice price for 500 under invoice.  How would they give you...  Let me ask you now.  No, we're not going to make any money under invoice.  It doesn't matter.  It's not your money.  It's their money.  Why would they do it?  Why would they do it?  They'll always do it, because they got a hold back. 
[01:26:30]  There's a hold back there.  Every car they sell, they're going to make $500, $600 on it, no matter what.  Okay.  And so if you say, invoice.  I want the invoice, or I'll go somewhere else, because I know they'll sell it to me for invoice.  Make them show you the invoice.  And then he goes, okay, go.  Leave.  And then you're like, okay, I'm sorry.  I'll pay.  Then you just leave.  I'll pay.  They even go to another dealership until one works with you. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Exactly.  There's plenty of them in the area.  I want to bring somebody with me who knows.  Again, I'm not going to be rude to these guys, because they're trying to make a living,  but just somebody that knows.  I don't know what to do.  You know what it comes down to?  You don't want to feel like you're being ripped off.  Yes.  That's what it comes down to.  I don't mind helping people out.  It's when you feel like you're getting fucking ripped off.  Right.  That's all I'm trying to avoid in my life.  Mm-hmm.  Yep. 
[01:27:30]  That's it.  I understand they've got to make their money.  I get it.  Don't fuck with me.  I'm talking in general terms here, not just trying to buy a car.  What, sir?  Every car salesman, no matter what car they sell, they're going to make at least, say,  100 bucks or 200 bucks.  They're going to make money no matter what.  And on new ones, they don't make any money.  I mean, they really don't.  All the money is made on use.  Oh, okay.  Use cars.  I've got a giant house that proves it. 
[01:28:00]  I love those guys.  So how do you determine what the lease price should be?  Because I like leasing for 30 months.  I don't want to lease for three years or five years.  I want to lease for two and a half years maximum.  Well, yeah.  Your payment's going to be a little bit higher on a shorter term lease.  Sure.  But to guarantee that you're getting the best deal, you know, on the car because, okay,  let's put it this way.  Way back when, and I'm not in the car business anymore.  I'm a business owner now.  You know, way back when we used to lease people and we used to make thousands of dollars a lease. 
[01:28:30]  Because all they wanted to buy on was payment.  Payment, payment, payment.  So if you cut out the payment part and just say, look, I want to buy it for this.  For this invoice price, you're guaranteed to get the best deal.  And if you say, I want to buy it for invoice price.  Right.  And then they show you the invoice.  And say, well, yeah, I think I want a lease.  So they're already locked into their price. 
[01:29:00]  Okay.  And then they show you the price of the car.  Right.  And then you say, I want to pay $500 under invoice.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And what about taxes come after that, I suppose?  Well, you have to pay the taxes, of course.  Okay, I figured.  Yeah, of course.  You've got to pay the taxes.  And in any lease, you know, what you need to do is you want to pay something up front.  You know, you want to pay like your first payment.  Right.  Or sometimes double the payment and your taxes.  And that helps bring the payment down a little bit. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Hold on a minute.  We've got Phil in Jersey that thinks Andy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  See, this is what scares me.  This always happens.  All right.  Phil in Jersey, you've got Andy on the line with you.  And it seems like you have a problem with Andy.  Go.  I don't really have a problem with Andy.  It's just Andy already said just now, he's been out of the business for a long time.  He don't sound like he's been in the business in this area.  And some of the stuff he said to Jimmy is all right.  But dude, depending on what kind of car you're trying to buy, don't listen to what Andy's 
[01:30:00]  going to tell you.  You don't sound any better than he does.  Or he don't sound any better than you do.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I'm asking you.  Now, what would you say that differed from Andy?  For starters, it depends a lot on what kind of car you're trying to buy.  Invoice and $500 behind invoice and holdback.  Every car company's got a holdback.  Yes, that has a lot to do with it.  But depending on the value of the car, it has a lot to do with how much holdback you're  talking about.  You could be getting $500 a holdback on a Civic or $7,000 a holdback on a big Mercedes. 
[01:30:30]  It has a lot of difference.  What you're talking about, $500 behind invoice, does not mean the same thing to the same car.  Now, I want to lease a Mercedes or a BMW.  I've been leasing a BMW.  I'm happy with it.  It's something, look, I like it.  I fucking drove shit cars for the first 17 years of my career.  Oh, right.  Actually, the first 15 years.  So, I don't mind spending money on it.  I'm not going to spend an exorbitant amount, and I don't want to buy it. 
[01:31:00]  You don't have to.  Leasing is the way to go.  And especially with the Highline stuff, the manufacturers are so competitive right now.  The dealers are so competitive right now.  Everybody's got incentives on the table that go way beyond holdback and invoice price.  Now, that doesn't mean that the dealer is going to lose money to sell you a car.  All that means is that invoice is only a small picture of what's going on.  You don't know how, and don't get me wrong.  You go into a proper Highline dealership in the right place that wants to earn your business, and they'll tell you the truth. 
[01:31:30]  Because the first thing right now, yeah, profit's important.  Don't get me wrong.  Profit's real important.  But customer service is more important.  So, they're bringing customers back to try to bring them in to do the right thing, and I want you to keep buying cars from the same place.  So, let me ask you about it.  So, when the guy at Mercedes, and they were nice dudes, but when he's saying to me,  well, there's a $795 just invoice fee, like...  That's an acquisition fee. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  That's to start up your lease.  What?  That's just the way it is.  Every single bank carries them.  Every single manufacturer carries them.  They vary in price a little bit, but most of them are between $600 and $800.  How do you get rid of that?  This asshole's still selling cars.  This asshole's still selling fucking cars!  Yes.  Why does that make me an asshole?  First of all, I have to be a manager of a car dealership.  And yes, why does that make me an asshole that that's my chosen career path?  I want an asshole about that. 
[01:32:30]  Listen, Jimmy.  Yeah.  The thing is, is that a dealer will only get into a holdback so much.  It doesn't matter if it's a Mercedes or a Hummer or a Lexus.  He's only going to get into it so much.  Because there's only so much you get into it.  The more you get into it, you win.  The more you get into it, you win.  If you start at invoice price and say, I'll pay you $1,000 under that, he's still getting  into his holdback, and he's going to keep as much of that holdback as he can.  Wait, what is holdback? 
[01:33:00]  Holdback is money that they get from, say, Chevrolet or Mercedes or, you know, the manufacturer.  Because on a, let's say an F-150 truck, Ford is making $12,000 to $15,000 off of the dealer.  And then the dealer sells it to you.  Okay.  Okay?  So there's a holdback there.  And there's dealer cash.  There's extra rebates.  Look at that.  They make the game so confusing that, you know. 
[01:33:30]  It is confusing.  For the consumer, we don't know what the fuck's going on.  They're saying BMW has no holdback.  So this topic is moot.  What does that mean?  That's not true.  Alright, listen.  The dealerships have no holdback.  Listen, I got a question for Andy and Phil.  I'm hearing that there are two invoices.  Who wants to admit this?  I don't know that.  I don't know that.  I'm got a good boy invoice.  I'm got a good boy invoice and a bad boy.  I'm got a good boy alarm and a bad boy alarm. 
[01:34:00]  I thought it's naughty.  So you do the same mistake I did.  I'm a naughty boy.  I fucked up.  And you scolded me for saying bad instead of naughty.  Yes.  Hey, no.  A few people are saying, and unfortunately neither guy on the line right now is willing  to admit this, that there are two invoices, the real one and the one they show you.  No.  That's not true.  Did you say two invoices?  Yes.  Two invoices?  I got to go.  Oh, well.  She just hung up.  I'm not insulted by that, but I'll answer your question for you. 
[01:34:30]  He was insulted.  I'm not insulted, but I'll answer it for you.  Sure.  Okay.  There's not two invoices.  The difference is the invoice price is what the car costs the dealership.  That does not represent holdback.  Holdback is triple net.  That's true, true cost of the dealership.  But you got to remember, and a lot of dealerships won't deal with that.  Although with the marketplace being real competitive, you will get into it a little bit, especially  depending on how much of it there is to give up.  But the holdback is what the manufacturers pay to the dealerships to compensate them for 
[01:35:00]  the amount of interest that they pay for carrying the car in their inventory before  you buy it and for any kind of operating expenses, advertising expenses.  If they sell us a car today and we don't sell it for three months, we pay interest to them  on it until we sell it.  Okay.  So if we really sell the car at invoice and we've been paying them interest for three  months to carry it because we bought it three months ago, that's what holdback is for so  that we don't literally lose money.  But it's a finite amount of money. 
[01:35:30]  And again, it's a percentage of the value of the car, so it varies on the price of the  car.  But, you know, I mean, that's what it is.  It's not true invoice.  There's invoice, which is cost of the car and triple net, which is what the true cost  of the dealer is.  But, you know, just like Andy said before, Jimmy said, you know, we are entitled to make  some money.  So now what about, is there a way around the acquisition fee?  Like, can they just lower the price somehow?  Yeah, but, you know, what you're dealing with is you're dealing with two separate entities. 
[01:36:00]  So you're dealing with, the car dealership is trying to negotiate with you to determine  a point where you're comfortable with, and then when you guys land there, they sell the  car to the bank at whatever price you agreed on, and then the terms of the lease kick in,  and the bank says, okay, well, this is how you start a lease.  Now, the dealer does it all for you, so you're not dealing with both sides of it.  Right.  The acquisition fee comes from the bank.  That's essentially their money, and in a lot of cases, it's the only profit that they  make. 
[01:36:30]  Who, the bank?  The bank, yeah.  Well, now I got a banker on my Twitter saying it's true.  I'm a banker.  We see a different invoice, so they show customer purchase order.  Yeah, because that's what I said to you, because the purchase order is not the invoice.  But as a consumer, we think that's the invoice.  What would I ask for, which would give me the absolute bare bottom price they paid for  it?  Well, this is what I said.  The invoice price does show what the dealer cost is.  Hold back is just a percentage of that. 
[01:37:00]  And the problem is that nobody's gonna really tell you exactly what real triple net is.  I don't know.  Maybe they will.  I guess we kind of do.  The problem is that now you're saying, well, I don't want you to make any money.  That's what that says to the dealership.  I want to know exactly what you paid for it down to that last penny because you're not  entitled to make a dollar on me.  No, but it's like you could say I want to know what you made down to the last dollar.  Not that I don't want you to make money on me.  And now I am completely informed.  So now they're not they're not going to deal with you, Jimmy. 
[01:37:30]  No, they don't want to deal with you if that if you will probably highball yourself if  you do that.  And what I mean by that is if you find out what it really really costs and say, well,  look, I'll give you that seems reasonable.  This is a $40,000 car.  I'll give you, you know, 3% over that.  I'll give you, you know, $4,000, you know, in total profit that you'll probably spend more  than you need to do that.  That's why I keep saying go to a reputable place where somebody that you either can trust 
[01:38:00]  or some, you know, some place that you know that you can trust and just ask them the questions.  The customer satisfaction is so important right now that most of the time I'm going to tell you the truth  and you're going to get the best deal just for just for trying to see Mercedes and BMW to their cars.  They look at it like anybody in there can afford it.  And they I think they deal with you a little bit differently.  Like, and I don't want to get into anything on the air, but take my information off the air because I can help you. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you.  Where are you based out of?  Rikers Island.  So I guess, I guess I'm like north central Jersey.  All right, Iraq, could you take his number?  Thank you very much.  I'm a good customer.  I love my fucking, the, the X6.  I like it a lot.  I've talked about it a million times.  It's very nice.  It's a fun.  Yeah.  Thing.  Yeah.  I don't have kids.  I'm not married.  So I fuck.  I like to lease a car.  Let's say hi to Alan Edison.  Al. 
[01:39:00]  Quickly, Al.  Cause I think we've, uh, real quick.  Yeah.  The difference between a lease and purchasing and all that means nothing.  You go in, you negotiate the price of the vehicle.  You know what it is online.  Kelly blue book tells you the invoice.  You offer the guy 500 miles above the invoice.  Kelly blue book.  Kelly blue book.com tells you everything.  How many blue balls.  Once you get that price, Jimmy, all you do is you say to the guy, once we agree $500 above cost, you now know what your term is going to be.  Let's say it's 36 months. 
[01:39:30]  Those figures are locked by the manufacturer.  They tell you the vehicle is worth 60% of what you paid for it after three years.  If you paid $50,000 for the car, 60% is what it'll be worth after three years.  You pay on 40%.  So you're only borrowing 40% of the vehicle.  So your cost is based on 40% times the money factor, which money factor means interest.  You know, your interest rate, multiply that out.  You divide your payments by 36.  That's what a lease is.  So the only negotiation on a lease is based on invoice. 
[01:40:00]  Everything else is set terms.  Yeah.  I understand what you're saying.  I need a real man to come with me.  I don't sell cars for a living.  I just like screwing dealers out of making a lot of money off by doing simple research on the internet.  There's websites out there that tell you how to lease.  Dude, everything you just said to me, I know is right.  And while you were talking, my brain was just throwing rocks around and I was bouncing a rubber ball making fucking child noises.  Your brain exploded, right? 
[01:40:30]  Dude, I can't.  Math stuff.  I mean, it's not hard.  Creative stuff I'm good with.  But math stuff like you just said, my head doesn't grab it.  Like I listen to you and I'm focusing on you.  It's like playing craps.  You got the pass don't pass as round one.  That's where you negotiate your invoice.  And then you got your cum, which is how am I going to pay for it?  Am I going to lease it?  Am I going to borrow it?  Am I going to pay cash?  It's all based on what the vehicle is worth after your term.  You negotiate that price.  The interest rate is locked.  The vehicle's total value is locked. 
[01:41:00]  Mercedes have great leases because they have a high perceived resale.  So people think after three years the thing is worth 60%, where a piece of crap Chevy may only be worth 40%.  So the lease is high on a Chevy.  So now you're taking 60% on to yourself.  Exactly.  Yes.  The percent rate times the interest and your payments are divided by that.  So the only power the dealer has on a lease is what is the invoice because everything comes off that total invoice.  And what if you have to get, like, how do you find out from a blue book? 
[01:41:30]  Like, say, I want to get this option and that option.  I mean, how do you-  Go to kellybluebook.com, kbb.com.  It tells you what the MSRP is and it tells you exactly what the dealer paid to the penny.  But with certain options too?  Wow.  Everything.  You can see the option.  And you bring that in from the dealer, his face drops and he goes, oh, crap.  Because he knows he's not going to be able to screw you over.  And you can tell.  Now, hold back.  You can't negotiate hold back.  Hold back is like the dealership gets 3% by the manufacturer for pushing a car that doesn't move. 
[01:42:00]  All right, Al, listen.  You and everyone else, you're pissing off a lot of dealerships.  And that's the way it works.  This is a touchy fucking topic.  Good.  We got Justin in, oh, Manch Vegas.  That would be Manchester.  Yeah.  500 over, doesn't even pay a salesman 75 bucks.  That prick is denying me a mortgage.  Tuck.  Get another job.  Oh, this guy.  This guy.  Well, this guy isn't in the business.  He just knows how to do the work around.  He said he likes screwing dealers over. 
[01:42:30]  But us just talking about it is really pissing off a lot.  Well, the dealers have to...  A lot of dealers out there.  If the dealers...  Look, the guys I dealt with, I like.  Like my guy, you know, who was at BMW in Jersey, I like a lot.  And I think he's a straight shooter.  He's not a scumbag at all.  I've dealt with him before.  And the guy I dealt with at Mercedes and the manager, I don't think they're...  I think they were being straight.  I just know I don't know what I'm doing.  Yeah.  And I told the guy that.  I'm like, I'm going to show this by my business.  Like, I don't know.  That's good to say to the guy.  I have to...  Look, I don't know what I'm doing.  Dude, if I don't say it...  You could fuck me in the ass.  You could only bluff so much with these guys because you can kick the tires. 
[01:43:00]  But as soon as he sits down, he knows if I'm not asking certain questions and I'm not knocking this, this and this down, I'm a fucking idiot.  I just sign whatever they put in front of me and drive away.  I know.  That's all I do.  I'm not trying to fuck the guy.  I don't mind them making a few bucks off him.  I'm a great customer, too.  Yes.  Because as soon as they pull out that calculator, they're like, alright.  And they start...  Here's what your monthly payment is.  Holy shit.  I'm like, alright, let me sign an initial and drive away. 
[01:43:30]  I don't care.  I know my poker phase drops at that point and I'm done as soon as that calculator comes out.  Alright, just a few numbers here now.  We're going to work this out.  Yeah.  They're adding this and that and you don't even know what's real.  What's fucking...  They're just adding because they know they can.  But, dude, here's my fucking big question.  Alright, you gotta do the...  What's the best you can do?  Like, I know what it is.  Yeah, yeah.  And literally, it doesn't...  What can you do for me?  If he said two million and eight tomatoes, I'd go, oh, I guess that's the best you can  do.  I have a 30-year lease on my car. 
[01:44:00]  But I fucking put no miles on my car.  That's why I don't want to pay a tremendous amount, too, A, because I don't want to spend...  You want Al's numbers, too?  Yes.  I put 8,000 miles in almost three years.  No miles!  I'm a great...  Crazy.  I'm fucking Larry Lease.  You have a little old lady from Pasadena.  That's what you buy.  You're not beating the shit out of your car.  Nah, but it still loses...  Yeah.  I don't want it after all those years.  Because you want a new car every once in a while.  I did that, dude.  I did that my whole fucking adult life.  Alan, uh...  A Topaz, a fucking Taurus, a fucking Mustang in the winter, which ran out of fucking...  You couldn't go up the fucking snow hill with it. 
[01:44:30]  A fucking Saturn, another fucking Saturn.  See, if you're going to continually lease vehicles, then it doesn't matter if you buy or lease.  Because you're just making payments.  Right.  Now, if you don't want to make any more payments, then you'd buy a car and after a while you're  done paying for it.  Now you have the car outright.  And you have an old car.  And you have an old car.  And you have an old car.  You want a new car every once in a while.  Yeah, so if you're going to every three years or so, let's say, get a new car, then you  might as well just lease because you're just paying. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  It doesn't matter.  Alright.  And I don't want to deal with trying to sell a fucking car or anything.  No!  I want to drive it into the dealership and go, good.  I'm here for my new one.  Take my old piece of shit.  I got no dings or dents.  The car's garage parked.  Yeah.  Fucking few loads dropped in it.  Yeah.  No one knows.  Who doesn't?  I want a new car and now I got to deal with selling it.  And they make it hard to sell it.  Of course.  Because at this point, I just want to give it to family members.  But the fucking state has to get their taste.  Yes, they do. 
[01:45:30]  So you can't just give shit away anymore.  Oh, no.  They have to pay the taxes on the blue book value of the fucking thing.  Oh, he's just grabbing money out of your pocket.  They love doing that.  You can't even do the right thing.  I want to give my car away to somebody in my family.  A new one?  It was the biggest pain in the ass.  The last one.  Because then the DMV got involved like, well, you got to prove taxes were paid on this.  And blah, blah.  You got to pay the taxes for the value of the car.  Like, didn't I pay taxes on it when I bought it?  Right.  Motherfucker.  Now, every time it changes hands, the government has their hand in it. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  It used to be when you wanted to do the right thing, you give it to somebody and maybe you  had to like, all right, you have to buy my car for a dollar, whatever the fuck it  was.  Remember that shit?  Especially on it.  As is.  One dollar.  Not as easy anymore, man.  No.  Like, the fucking state needs their taste.  Yeah, we'll determine how much it's worth and we'll tax on it.  Yeah, they need their taste.  So you can't just like, pass cars along that easily.  So if you want to give it to somebody, these motherfuckers want to find the blue book value  and make the guy you're giving it to pay you fucking cocksucker.  That's simplifying it.  Yeah.  In a lot of cases, yeah, that's exactly what happens. 
[01:46:30]  How old is your car, dude?  You got a new car, right?  Mine's only-  Two years?  I'm up to two.  So, you know, next year I want to obviously-  How many miles you got?  A lot.  Oh, you do a lot of Philly.  Yeah, I do a lot of Philly trips.  So, a lot.  And then I drove it to the Outer Banks and-  Oh, but for leasing-  It's beat up pretty good at this point.  For leasing, miles, I don't do the miles.  So, I can get the minimal miles, whatever the minimal is.  Oh, yeah.  You're in a great position.  You do more than like 15,000 a year? 
[01:47:00]  No.  Oh.  Because I live in the city.  Probably over 10, though.  Between 10 and 12.  So, we do a lot of trips, but-  All right.  We should break into some other shit.  We got Elijah Wood.  He was in recently and said yeah a lot.  And-  He certainly did.  The boys picked up on that.  So, check this out and we'll be back with more shit.  And now, Hollywood actor, A-list celebrity, and Frodo Baggins himself.  Elijah Wood says yeah 80 times. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Totally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:48:00]  saying yeah. Yeah, I know, right?  80 times. Like, I don't even know how I could process 
[01:48:30]  that. It's so awesome.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony. On the virus.  You're good boy phone and you're naughty boy  phone.

[01:49:30]  I like the naughty boy phone.  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Virus  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Tracy Morgan has returned to the comedy stage  finally after all that controversy  of the last  what three three and a half weeks now  on stage for the first time since 
[01:50:00]  anti-gay tirade  tirade  wasn't a tirade  you assholes  he was doing his act  I read  Tracy Morgan gave his first live comedy performance  in New York on Saturday night  since his now infamous  anti-gay rant earlier this month  in Nashville  it was  I love how  but that's what they say it is  so now that's what it is  it wasn't that  I know  some people had a problem with it  but the fact is  he was doing his act  it wasn't pulling a  you know  Kramer 
[01:50:30]  Kramer right  Michael Richards  by all accounts  the performance  at Caroline's Comedy Club  was pretty much controversy free  but Morgan did address  the recent scandal  while on stage  he did  you're all sitting here  waiting  you want to do Tracy  or I'll just read it  no you can just read it  you're all sitting here  waiting for me  to say something about the controversy  right  he said  which the audience cheered  and applauded  according to the New York Times  I'm 42 man  and now all of a sudden  I'm a homophobic  to emphasize the point 
[01:51:00]  that he's not homophobic  Morgan quipped  while laughing  my father was the lead singer  in the village people  I would sing the YMCA  the loudest  I was sitting right there  when he wrote the song  My Daddy  the Indian was my grandfather  or godfather  the Indian was my godfather  so he's making jokes right  and then this dope  that wrote this article  in parentheses writes  Morgan's relatives  aren't actually members  of the village people  oh thank god  a literal author  what an idiot 
[01:51:30]  he had to make that point  he later added  the  he later  added  of the homophobic  accusations  I don't have that in me  I believe  gay, straight, anybody  everybody's supposed to be  happy in the world  man  also later in the show  Morgan said he had  something on his mind  that he couldn't share  with the audience  when  then proceeded to  encourage him  to do just that  so  I can't  Morgan respond  I just got out of the  controversy man  this is diabolical  diabolical 
[01:52:00]  so he's too scared  to really address it  that's what Glad  did to him  I got something to say  about the homosexuals  but I ain't saying it  he was too scared  I can't go on  another month for this  but he did go to a gym  I know  it proves my point though  they were holding him hostage  and now he's scared shitless  and you know  he wanted to say a lot  but it seems  like Morgan  couldn't resist  pushing the envelope  one comment  that earned  groans and shouts  of uh oh 
[01:52:30]  from the audience  was  don't ever mess  with women  who have retarded  kids  them young  retarded males  is strong  they're strong  like chimps  and that's  Tracy Morgan  they're strong  like chimps  now what  another organization  will have to go  after him  they got that  retard strength  that's right  don't talk at the  wrong guy  they're retarded  you know  the R word  hurts 
[01:53:00]  but there you go  there's a guy  just fucking  you know  doing his act  I want to apologize  to all the stupid  retards  I'm very sorry  I didn't mean  to say that  oh  he's a fucking  I have to be in front  of a bunch of  retarded people  trying to talk to him  well  he also  fucking throw rocks  at him  he also made a joke  about his alleged  teenage relationship  with a girl  he called  a cripple  good boy  she was a cripple  that's Tracy  though man  she were pigeon 
[01:53:30]  toed  doesn't mean  he doesn't mean  anything  doing his act  and when you hear him  saying stuff like that  retarded  you just know  he doesn't  he doesn't care  right  Bronfello  look at this kangaroo  that bit  was great  and it was right  at the tail end  of his tenure  there at SNL  and he finally  gave him something  and he finally got  a funny ass character  right  the bird  tried to steal  my credit card  they really 
[01:54:00]  never used him  properly  until the end  huh  they almost  never used  black talent  properly  except for  Eddie Murphy  who was  Dick Ebersole  and why is that  I don't know  I mean  Garrett Morris  was underused  Dean Edwards  was underused  I think Tracy  was underused  but then we think  Garrett Morris  isn't funny  maybe  but I mean  he was still  he should have  been on the show  then  is he a funny guy  that they just  kind of  he was the black guy  they needed him  as the black guy  to do like  you know  but Tracy Moore  we all know  is a really funny guy  and he doesn't have  a lot of SNL skits 
[01:54:30]  that you want to check out  he just doesn't  very very good to me  right  he finally had  Brian Fellows  at the end of his career  but  can you hear this for a second  I don't know  what it sounds like  is that in Newport  yes it is  I'm Brian Fellow  Brian I'd like you  to meet a friend of mine  he's an Amazon yellow nape  that goes by the name  of Bailey  what do you say  Bailey  hello  that bird just talked 
[01:55:00]  that's right  the parrot  is able to mimic  human speech patterns  that's crazy  hello  he just did it again  you know  Bailey and I  are big fans  of the show  and we worked up  a special treat for you  would you like to see it  would I  it's a great bird  hey pretty bird  hey pretty bird  who are you  I'm Brian Fellow  that bird is a liar  I'm Brian Fellow 
[01:55:30]  he's starting to make me mad  he better shut up  I'm Brian Fellow  no you're not  hey I'm sorry  I taught him how to say that  I thought you'd like it  he's an imposter  because I'm Brian Fellow  I'm Brian Fellow  that's it  take him away  this is my show  that bird is not funny  and I better not see him again  hopefully we will fix this  in editing  he's got lip gloss on  I wouldn't 
[01:56:00]  never just watch it  that's very funny  I've never seen that character  I knew I was familiar  but it's hilarious  it's a great character  sounds gay almost  yeah yeah  he's very flamboyant  I'm kidding  I know  I'm gonna ask  oh that's the one  the rock was on  wow okay  so what are you gonna do  but they don't use black guys  properly on SNL  I don't think they really have  no  and I'm trying to think  who else is on  I'm sure there's other guys 
[01:56:30]  I'm not thinking of  Chris Rock  Chris Rock  Chris Rock barely got used  on SNL  that's what I'm saying  and we all know  how funny Chris Rock is  so what the fuck  are they doing over there  you got someone like Chris Rock  and you got a Tracy Morgan  and they don't have anything  that's really memorable  only Eddie Murphy got the right  and again that's when  Dick Ebersome  yeah  right  Tim Meadows was  oh god yeah  he was there for nine years  right  or eight years  yeah he just hung out  like oh good  I'm here another season  I don't even know  but I would say  that Tim Meadows  is not funny  just cause of what 
[01:57:00]  I saw on SNL  but he might be  he might be hilarious  I never found  his bits funny  you know how annoyed  he must be  at like 30 Rock  being so successful  he can't be a part of it  yeah  that's gotta be like  come on  I used to be on SNL  doing all kinds of  characters and stuff  I do want  is Daryl Hammond still on  no  I was thinking about him  yesterday  what do you mean  he finally left  no he's on  yeah  oh  hey  oh I thought this was  in America  who cares about this story  it's a neutral 
[01:57:30]  what do you expect  oh okay  no him or her  preschool fights  gender bias  yes I agree with this  it's uh  it's very good  it's perfect  at the Egalia preschool  staff avoid using words  like him or her  and address the 33 kids  as friends  rather than girls  and boys  right  what if they're not friends  what if they don't like  each other  they have to like each other  or that's bullying  Jimmy  oh good point  you're forced to like  everybody now  don't you know that  so they don't want  guys or girls 
[01:58:00]  boys or girls  to be  boys or girls  boys or girls  they don't want that  influencing how they grow up  what's wrong with being a boy  what's wrong with being a girl  nothing  what's wrong with that  you are what you are  so  gender bias  from the color and placement  of toys  to the choice of books  every detail has been  carefully planned  to make sure the children  don't fall into gender  stereotypes  I said this a long time ago  we're all going to be robots  eventually  this is  this is robotic shit  it's a social experiment 
[01:58:30]  I'd be pissed  if I was a parent  it's like  don't pull your social  fucking experiments  on my kid  stupid  homeschooling man  I'm telling you  is that where you're  you're headed  I know those kids  were always the creepy ones  but it's starting to make  more and more sense  as a parent  to just homeschool  your kid  yeah  fucking hire some people  that know math  and shit  and come over  and teach them some numbers  tutor  cause I don't want to  deal with this crap  and by the way  there's 80 cameras  in the room  so don't try to touch 
[01:59:00]  my kid  yeah exactly  just teach him shit  society expects girls  to be girly  nice and pretty  and boys to be manly  rough and outgoing  says Jenny Johnson  31 year old teacher  Egalia  gives them a fantastic  opportunity  to be whomever  they want to be  but that's  basic human nature  you're trying to go against  you're trying to use  this social bullshit  to change  what we are  as animals  there is a male 
[01:59:30]  and there is a female  and we assume  certain roles  based on  that  sexuality  you're not gonna have  you're gonna have  some crossovers  there  you know  but for the most part  the guy will always  be the hunter  the woman will always  be the nesting  you know  it's just the way it is  it's animal instinct  they're trying to  they're trying to  like  reprogram people 
[02:00:00]  to keep that  animal instinct  at bay  and it's like  just stop it  we're animals  enough  and how is that  gonna come out  eventually  if you continue  down this road  you know what I mean  it's just gonna fuck up  and confuse people  absolutely  the taxpayer funded  preschool  which opened last year  in the liberal  salarmalm district  of stockholm  stockholm  for kids age 1 to 6  is among the most  radical examples  of sweden's efforts  to engineer equality  between the sexes  from childhood onward  good job 
[02:00:30]  what are liberals doing  they're dumb  uh  at egalia  the title  uh  means equality  equality  friends means equality  boys and girls  play together  with a toy kitchen  waving plastic utensils  and pretending to cook  why do they gotta have  the girl things  that is a girl thing  do they have uh  maybe some uh  you know army stuff  yeah they have the guns too  good question  they would never do that  no why would they  lego bricks and other 
[02:01:00]  building blocks  are intentionally placed  next to the kitchen  why  to make sure the children  draw no mental barriers  between cooking  and construction  sure  make me an omelet  and a fucking  a little brick comes  in the fucking plate  i'm making a dormer  on my house  out of suckatash  wouldn't it be funny  though  if they want  no gender things  but blacks  were frowned  and spit upon  when they walked in  because they're all  blonde and swedish  fucking neutral  shithouse  bunch of racists  i despise the swedes 
[02:01:30]  despise them  despise  everybody's eating  meatballs  bunch of meatball  eating motherfuckers  little meatballs though  because they're swedish  i hate swedish meatballs  you like swedish meatballs  i prefer sourish  i love swedish meatballs  get the fuck out of here  you need a  big fucking  yes  meaty balls  you need a nice  red sauce  with your meatballs  fuck that swedish shit  nah swedish meatballs  are the shit man  you're italian man  you should  you should hand in

[02:02:30]  on fostering an environment  tolerant of gay  lesbian  bisexual  and transgender  people  i don't want my kid  we're going to  eaglia  eaglia  everybody pumping  their peters  in eaglia  from a bookcase  she pulls out a story  i don't want no bookcase  around my kids  she pulls out a story  about two male giraffes  who are said to be  childless  they can't suck each other's  dicks because their  necks are so long  giraffes are very phallic 
[02:03:00]  aren't they  yes  they look like giant cocks  giant hard-ons  puts his head up the other  giraffe's ass  giant hard-ons with legs  walking around  until they come across an  abandoned crocodile egg  and then what happens  they make shoes out of it  because they're gay  and they like fancy things  tee hee  oh i want a crocodile bag  they start swishing around  wow  wow someone in this school 
[02:03:30]  district is uber gay  yeah  that's what this is about  because nearly all the  children's uh  books deal with  homosexual couples  nearly all of them  wow  uh  single parents or adopted  children  there are no snow white  cinderella or other  classic fairy tales  seen as cementing  stereo  fairy tales would be  perfect  wow the staff also  try to help the children  discover new ideas 
[02:04:00]  when they play  uh oh  uh oh  new ideas like what  yeah  a concrete example  could be when they're  playing house  and the role of the mom  already is taken  and they start to  squabble she says  then we suggest  two moms or three moms  and so on  and a dad to punch  the ball in the eye  to blacken their  saucy eyes  when the fucking  brick is cold  because they don't  know how to cook  because these dumb  cunts were making  fucking houses  when there were nine  idiots  i'd hate to grow up  in that stupid district  stinks  my house is made 
[02:04:30]  of spaghetti  every time it rains  it falls  it's great when it's  hot out because  it's stiff  but whenever it rains  it's a delicious  action all over my face  i have a carb house  sweet as just buckets  your spaghetti roof  collapses on you  is what you're saying  maybe switzerland  is the one who's all  neutral i think i'm  wrong about that  all i know is this  i would love to  invade fucking sweden  and just savagely  beat them with  fucking axe handles  for no reason  what have we done 
[02:05:00]  we haven't done  anything  we like a penis  and a vagina the  same  we like it  the hair  underneath the  balls  we don't want to know  difference between the  construction and the  cooking  make me adorable  hungry  oh look i'm gonna eat  the lampshade  it's raining  could you build me a  cake hat  build me a cake 
[02:05:30]  umbrella  you fucking idiots  i love your swedish  accent  exactly it's very  organic  it's right there  we like it to go to  a galley  all of the teachers  have two n's  and two s's  and o's  and their names  i had a soon  go fuck yourself  we're having nine  of the mommies  and the no daddies  everything's  even the socks  are being used  as tampons  two other things  about this 
[02:06:00]  those bent on  shattering gender roles  say there's a hierarchy  where everything that  boys do is given  higher value  but i wonder who  decides that  it has higher value  she says  why is there higher  value in playing  with cars  and some parents  people are asking  if this is private  or public  it's public  because it's  taxpayer funded  taxpayer funded  some parents worry  things have gone  too far  an obsession  with obliterating  gender roles  they say  could make the  children confused  and ill-prepared  to face the world 
[02:06:30]  outside kindergarten  abso-fucking-lutely  i said  yeah  i rule  the fucking father  the husband's hungry  the wife is  whipping up some  mortar  same joke  eight times  how many times  am i gonna do it  we got it  it's a mix-up  gym  they cook with  construction equipment  we get it  yeah  hey look  i uh  hey my  my soup is getting  cold  oh here you  see it's a jack  not even the right 
[02:07:00]  stuff  you're standing  over your fucking  dinner plate  trying to cut your  steak with a  fucking concrete  jack  breaks the plate  everybody's like  hey  this idea stinks  this is stupid  how long is this  bit gonna go on  hours  i started at  620  got it  don't mind my  business  just eat these  fucking small  gravel pebbles  oh sorry  they're blueberries  i don't know the  difference  because you grew  up in one of  those schools  that's right  friends  we're all 
[02:07:30]  friends  that's right  friends don't let  friends drive drunk  you're amongst  friends  you're among  friends ricky  or ricotta  whatever your  name is  did you cut  your wrist with  it what did you  cut your wrist  with there was  it a tomato  or a knife  i don't know  the difference  between construction  and cooking  it's awful  i think the  problem is that  you can teach a  little of that  but they're going  way the fuck  too far  whatever you  teach a little  of that  fine but  that's why  we suck 
[02:08:00]  huh  that's why  we suck  as a country  as far as  education  no no  i mean like  like we  but we're  doing kind  of the same  thing  instead of  just concentrating  on the basics  in school  you're reading  writing and  arithmetic  uh  it's a bunch  of this  social  awareness  non-bullying  uh  diversity  tolerance  how about  uh history  how about  some fucking  math and  science  so these  kids don't 
[02:08:30]  get out of  school  and are  are fucking  20th in the  world  behind uh  every other  country that's  uh kicking our  ass  how about  sex education  no place for  that in the  schools  so they know  where to  take it  the shitter  sure  ouch  ouch  the sweetest  kids yell  different  i need to put  that in my  tiny  uncle paul  easy friend 
[02:09:00]  friends  we're all  friends  uncle paul  doesn't care  you think  they use the  same bathroom  over there  oh what  about that  they want  girls to start  standing up  to take a  piss  they don't  come out  with their  little patent  leather shoes  covered in  urine  exactly  they're  lederhosen  even though  it's not  the same  fucking country  there it is  we don't  care  we don't  care  we don't  care  urine  soaked  lederhosen  and their 
[02:09:30]  patent  shoes  you said  that's a  dumb story  that's scary  shit though  because we get  our cues from  elsewhere right  that's what's  happening  i'm sure one of  these dumb  new york city  schools will try  something like  that  we're so far  behind  may bloomberg  will be all  for it  and then  yeah  white babies  are a minority  now i guess  what in new  york  yeah no in  the country  in the country  yeah as far  as babies are  concerned there's  more um  more non-white  babies than  white babies  yeah 
[02:10:00]  i understand  that everybody  uh kind of uh  talks about how  great america is  we have a great  country it's a  great fantastic  country for years  we've had a great  country and then  um all they talk  about is wanting  to change it  constantly  constantly it's  like wait a  minute and and  you know more  diversity and this  it's like well  oh white people  have been in  charge long  enough we need  more diversity  it's like well  that great country 
[02:10:30]  we're talking  about was was  like made great  when a bunch of  white people were  running it i'm not  casting an opinion  here i'm just  saying this is  what it was  so i just see  us uh in the  future um maybe  not being a third  world nation like  like sub-saharan  africa but i do  see us being a  huge welfare  nation um that  really doesn't make  anything and we'll  just fall into  another empire that 
[02:11:00]  is you know kind  of relegated to  just being a piece  of shit  really good run  though  a couple hundred  years not even  that great of a run  a couple hundred  years  change how many  years  empire was around  for a long  time time we're  not we're not  going to come  close we ain't  coming close to  that no we're  already on the  road to ruin  do you see these  fucking the flash  mob shit that  keeps happening  or the lynch mob  now yeah yeah  see what they  left out of that  story of course  what's the lynch  mob story 
[02:11:30]  oh race  uh some kid got  that shit beat out  of them and  white kid by i  think 15 black  kids yeah or  some black and  whatever but they  don't even mention  it in the story  no no why would  that another story  of uh a gang of  uh black uh youths  of course unruly  youths teens uh  running around  saying uh you  know let's kill the  white people kill  white people  let's kill white  people yay  and then they say  black in that story  the word black is 
[02:12:00]  so dirty to  reporters yes and  it's so revealing  they say a bunch of  african-american youth  went around yelling  to kill white people  but do you understand  the fucking cultural  elitism of that like  it's white people  feeling better you  can say white because  you're comfortable  saying that but if  you say black what  is it a little too  fucking strong for  you white reporters  how do you know  they were african-american  how do you know  they weren't fucking  haitian immigrants  right who were  fucking how do you  know their parents  weren't fucking uh 
[02:12:30]  one was french and  one was haitian come  on i've seen reporters  use african-american  when they were talking  about africans in  africa like here's a  picture of african-americans  it was like no they're  they're fucking africans  right uh sears got uh  i guess uh 30 or so  uh blacks ran into a  sears and just started  robbing things um  another store walmart  got got hit they plan 
[02:13:00]  these things on whatever  social media but how  about those those  companies figure out  social networking oh  so you can see it  coming okay lock the  doors lock the doors  oh no you can't do  that if you see 30  black kids walking in  you go away where  then you're then  you're discrimination  doesn't work but what  happened what happened  they went in and uh  just started grabbing  merchandise uh knocking  a few people around  too can i can i be  completely honest yeah  that's pretty smart uh  well it's a smart way to  rob if you're going to 
[02:13:30]  be one of those guys  that what a brilliant  idea is because now who  the fuck do you grab  exactly but now well  they grabbed one guy a  19 year old and  honestly i'm not i'm  outraged i really am i'm  with you on this but if  you think about it it's  kind of smart genius  same thing fucking  hitler thought of and  so did napoleon just  running there with a  bunch of people  bunch of people  all of a sudden you  got 30 guy black guys  or black kids in your  store grabbing and  running yeah fuck what  an idea it's this  organized how are they 
[02:14:00]  going to stop that  chaos i don't know how  you'd stop this because  they never know where  they're going to pop up  um you got to infiltrate  ah yeah somebody's got to  be like an online  monitor shooting them  yeah that's what i  know they need armed  security guards that  will just pistol whip  the fuck out of these  punks punk thugs  yeah punk what would  you do if you're you  were in one of those  stores when that was  happening as it as  i would stand i'd stand 
[02:14:30]  with my back against the  wall and i'd fucking  watch i'd watch if i  felt my life was being  threatened i would shoot  somebody that's it but  there's a real answer  but in in general if  they were just ravaging  the place and robbing  the place i would just  watch and go oh look  at that there you go  thank you mlk would be  proud he'd be very proud  of you uh all right now  very good  yeah they got to figure  that out because it's  savagery going on more  that's happening i just 
[02:15:00]  don't like the way it's  reported yeah that's what  bothers me it's not even  the stories it's the fact  that the media just won't  say it no they won't say  it i know we've made a lot  of people aware of that  because i get a lot of  people tell me like god  i never noticed that  yep but read the story  about the lynch mob in  south carolina where they  beat this again gangs of  people beat up people but  they just refuse you know  on twitter some white guy  said to me well how do you  know it was racial it's  like the fact that it's not  mentioned at all when it  would be in reverse right  you're naive or a liar if  you don't believe that 
[02:15:30]  maybe some people just  naive gang of white people  they beat the shit out of  one black guy no it is  racial before they even  investigate it before one  word comes out of why the  fight happened why they  beat this guy up it is a  gang of whites assaulted a  black guy uh reverend al  is out claims of a hate  crime that but the other  way around it's just well  there may have been a  problem over some money or  this that we're looking into  it it's so it really is a 
[02:16:00]  way of them saying that  blacks are stupid without  meaning to yeah it's like  you give the higher motive  even if it's a devious  motive to white people  when white people commit  the crimes it's because  there's a mode uh it was  racial hatred or it's  based in some type of  thought yeah when blacks do  it it's because they need  money and they just club you  over the head and take it  it's this fucking i'm telling  you man white people who  write these stories are such  fucking elitist yeah cocks 
[02:16:30]  yep and they don't even mean  to be they're not trying to  be to think that blacks only  have robbery as a motive is  like saying fucking  uggsy phone ugg take like  they don't think that any  thought could go into it  they don't think a bunch of  black guys could have a  racial disc because white  people don't want to  fucking look at the racial  anger right that a lot of  black people have towards  them with their way of  pretending it doesn't exist  instead of going yeah you  know what shithead there are  a lot of blacks that don't  like you yeah and will  target you before targeting 
[02:17:00]  somebody else but they don't  want to acknowledge that to  themselves it's embarrassing  it really is it's what you  always have a higher  why people never just club  black people over the head  to rob them there's always  another motive always racial  because i guess white people  are better thinkers yeah  even though it's a devious  motive it's still a thought  out motive i'm repeating  myself i'm sorry it's as if  it's expected drives me crazy  and uh yeah it's terrible  casey uh anthony looking  really uh nice it looks like  she washed her hair is this  what it's looking a little  greasy yeah um she's got a 
[02:17:30]  a little white uh top on  i think she's giggling a  little bit with uh her  lawyer she put her hand in  front of her face she should  be fucking she's giggling a  little bit look at the face  like literally when she  covers her mouth i want  someone to punch her fucking  teeth through her fucking  hand jimmy she's a sweet  look at her she's laughing  why she's a sweet girl look  her smile lights up the  courtroom what i know you  guys are having fun with that  but logically but logically  what what is the purpose of 
[02:18:00]  her like laughing and  giggling and stuff wouldn't  you think a lawyer would say  that's not that's not help  yeah but wouldn't they say  that's not helping us why are  you laughing you know when  these cameras are on well  every time they show a  picture of the body you just  can't start cracking up  well uh what do you think  oh you gotta look this was um  in 2008 three years ago this  happened um when you're under  this kind of stressful  situation you're in a  courtroom every day your life  is on the line um there are 
[02:18:30]  going to be moments of levity  where you where you wouldn't  think look she's covering her  mouth again when she talks to  a lawyer she learned how to do  that by the way at the  beginning of the trial she  would just talk and they have  lip readers that would uh  figure out what she was  saying so now she covers her  mouth and what do the lip  readers uh pick up on  uh i killed my baby the  dingo baby yeah yeah and i  know it's been said a million 
[02:19:00]  times but she really does look  like an elf when her hair is  pulled back i find her  adorable ears are fucking  weird she has uh she looks  like a little uh yeah a  little wood elf from lord of  the rings ears are dopey in  general yeah they really are  i'm glad we get to cover ours  every day so we don't have to  look at each other's ears i'm  gonna force people put  headphones on i'm gonna i'm  gonna put this thought in  everyone's head today just  look at ears wherever you go  today and you're gonna start  laughing they're all foldy and  weird they're horrible what's

[02:25:00]  where  nepal  oh  no not uncle paul  nepal what's going on over there  uh a lot of big magic scene  well it's not the magic in the traditional sense  it's more uh you know we're mysticism and ritual  and oh oh so it takes it to that step of uh supernatural  kind of exactly  sort of just examining the roots of of magic  do you do you feel like you're still in nepal  do i feel like it now  yeah because you're wearing a winter coat  and it's about 100 degrees outside  what is wrong with this dan white 
[02:25:30]  why is he wearing a coat  is that your look  uh yeah  that's just what i do  all right i'm sorry  sorry for finding a coat  but you're right  summertime  you work with um  uh  oh god  jesus christ  oh my god  david blaine  david blaine  um  do you guys hate chris angel  i don't know about hate  but i mean we uh  you know it's  strong dislike  it's a  you know  we're fellow magicians  i don't think anybody hates anybody  is he always messing with um  he's always messing with david blaine though 
[02:26:00]  who's chris angel always going after  is he david blaine  uh yeah i think in the past  i don't think so much anymore  but yeah in the past for sure  yeah if you look at his stuff sometimes  i go like  ah i know how he does that  no i actually you know  he's a hard worker  and he's accomplished some amazing things  so yeah i mean  i'm very impressed with what he's accomplished  for sure  do you like pen and teller  yeah  those guys are great right  they're fantastic  yeah we love uh those guys  what did you uh  what have you seen in nepal  that uh kind of  made you go like  oh whoa that is weird  well you know for me  it was uh being a magician 
[02:26:30]  you sort of see magic all the time  and it's nice to see  its origin  so seeing uh  people do those things  that you read about in books  like oh i've never seen that before  the snake charmers  and yeah  you know these  indian rope tricks  that you've heard about  and all those sort of things  that uh  being a westerner  we always imagine  this is what  like real magic  would look like  uh seeing it over there  was definitely kind of cool  did you see um  we had those guys  in the amateur magicians  uh for lance burton  did you see that  that little documentary 
[02:27:00]  it's pretty good right  they're friends of mine  and that was a great documentary  they were nice guys  they were really  how awful was it  when the chick  the hot chick drops  she messes  she makes the mistake  while doing the ball transfer  into the hat  and you're like  oh yeah  it's kind of good to see though  because you never see  magic tricks get fucked up  so it was kind of fun  you know  unless i'm trying one  what kind of  you do close-up stuff  yeah  close-up stuff mostly  which i think is the hardest  to do obviously  sleight of hand  correct  what is your specialty  or what would you say  is what you do very well  uh you know  the close-up stuff  so basically anything 
[02:27:30]  with the cards  coins small objects  but uh  yeah  mostly mostly the small things  how long have you been doing it  uh since i was about 11  10 or 11  well you're not  25 30  yeah  okay  i like doing close-up type magic  but from like a hundred yards away  because then they can't see it  get it  i do close-up magic  with large objects  and i never do well  like i'll be sitting in front of a car  yeah  and i'll say no  this is going to disappear  and it just doesn't  and i just say that  your energy is wrong  i just blame them  blame the crowd  your energy is wrong folks 
[02:28:00]  could you show us one  because we all like magic  sure  definitely  it's easy  everyone wants to pretend  they don't care about magic  i love magic  everybody loves magic  i love being freaked out  and just being so mystified  and just lost  oh i see how you did that  you took the cards out of the deck  oh that's what he does  oh sorry  the obvious part  i'm just trying to get  let me chew gum  so i don't have fucking turkey chili  bark in the magician's face  there's a  there's not a girl  in the studio  is there  oh what are you kidding  travis  no we don't  no  no girls 
[02:28:30]  all right  well this is going to look  kind of weird then  okay  just roll with it  i'll be the girl  all right  jimmy will be the girl  yeah  great  i'll have time on rikers  sorry  you don't mind standing up  no no no  great  all right  deck of cards  right yeah  i'll probably need somebody  to narrate a little bit  that's okay  a sharpie  okay  um  do me a favor  name a card  since we have 52 different ones  oh can you say a card  anyone  uh ace of diamonds  ace of diamonds  all right  so we go through  find the ace of diamonds  what i need you to do  is put your uh 
[02:29:00]  put your signature on there for me  right  he's taking a sharpie  jimmy's taking a sharpie right now  and he's um  writing  his signature on the front  right on the front  so you can see that  you know what it looks like  right  yes  you obviously recognize this  okay yeah  no it's good  what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna  fold the card up  into quarters  what i'm gonna need you to do  is i want you to put it  between your teeth  okay  all right so put your mouth  right between your teeth  hold it there  time to start chewing gum  he's holding it between his teeth 
[02:29:30]  now i'm gonna do the same thing  i hope it's clean  with the next card  the four of spades  all right  four of spades  just sign my name across it  sharpie right across the face of it  just like that  so blowing that  or i'll blow it up  since you have something in your mouth  uh-huh  watch the card  the four of spades  i'm gonna do the exact same thing with  fold in half  okay  now i'm not gonna go anywhere near you  or touch your card in your mouth  with my hands at all  i'm just gonna use the sharpie  and push it in my mouth 
[02:30:00]  uh-huh  that's totally in his mouth  totally in his mouth  he's grabbing his hands  all right  he's concentrating  he's got jimmy's hands  wait  there's  there's smoke coming  there's smoke coming out of his mouth  what the hell  from nowhere  what  your card  was ace of diamonds  uh-huh 
[02:30:30]  now the ace of diamonds  came out of his mouth  wait a minute  open your mouth  and  should i open it  yeah  jimmy never  removed that from his mouth  and that is the  four of spades  that he signed  oh boy  jesus  in your mouth  kind of gives me the  i mean i've had similar things happen  someone else's thing was in your mouth  yeah  yeah i understand  wow  that is a great trick 
[02:31:00]  god jesus dude  and the smoke out of the mouth is pretty good  well yeah  that really sells  the way that comes from  how do you do the smoke in the mouth thing  he's not gonna tell you jack shit  why not man  because he's a magician  it's a code  that's great dude  that's pretty cool  you ever see the prestige  yeah great movie  oh the great danton  oh  yeah that was a great movie  i like that  i enjoyed that  how much ask has it gotten you in your life  uh  you know it's helped  yeah  it's definitely helped  especially probably uh  growing up  being able to 
[02:31:30]  pull that off at a party or something  i think that's the thing with magicians  is uh  we're so used to  being the dorky ones  sort of like  the guys at the star trek convention  and uh  you know you grow up  and you start doing it  and you realize  hey this thing might  socially help me a little bit  yeah yeah  i would imagine  i don't think anybody really gets into it  for that at first  at least when they're kids  it's just a good side thing  right  and it's like  oh wait  this is  because girls do love magic  oh  they'll come around  they got a guy  if a guy's doing magic  at a party or something like that 
[02:32:00]  chicks are all over it  the guys are just like  how many hours  and they try to ruin  you kind of try to cock block you  by figuring out how you did it  yeah i know  i don't do that  how many hours a day  uh you know  at this point  i perform so much  that it's not  performing is my practice  okay  you know  so when i'm  if i'm doing something new  i do it in performance  to try to  to practice  and work it in  have you screwed tricks up before  like we're in front of people  where you're like  that always happens  i think  with anything 
[02:32:30]  yeah  do you look at other magicians stuff  and  and  for the most part  can you figure out  how it's done  um  you know  it's  it's another one of the things  it's just from being  in the business for so long  it's sort of  yeah  for sure  because there are probably  i don't look at it like  oh how's it done  you know  i think most  professional magicians  look at it  what's the technique  or  what's the presentation  yeah  how does he pull it off  does it look good  yeah  does he have personality  right  i can see that  and are there set  things like that are 
[02:33:00]  uh  a basic  um  formula for a trick  that the presentation's  different sometimes  but it's pretty much  the same  uh  uh  technique  yeah i mean  there's a  yeah there's a group  i mean there's  you know  10 or 12 different  types of effects  and everything's  are just  you can actually  narrow it down  even more than that  really  yeah and uh  you know  vanishing  appearing  changing  uh  different sort of  subgroups like that  and everything's just 
[02:33:30]  based off of those things  and with each thing  like with cards  coins  there's all different  techniques  that every  what he learns  yeah  what's the trick  you've seen  recently or whatever  because to me  that was incredible  although like a guy  on your level  would look at it  oh that he did  a nice job on that  what's one that  you've seen recently  where you're like  fuck  that was really  unbelievable  hmm  transformed man  that's a tough one  i don't know  i haven't seen one  in a while  you know  anything that  that david copperfield  does i'm a big fan  of his 
[02:34:00]  oh yeah  he's done some  really great things  that i see  oh boy  i saw a cup  i was deeply  disappointed  and i love magic  i think he got lazy  but you know  he's always been  one of my idols  no i understand  why the guy  was huge  in his specials  i understand  but by the time  i saw him in vegas  i don't know  the first 20 minutes  was a hey look at me  montage  and then finally  did a few tricks  well for you  it's like you grew up  that's the guy 
[02:34:30]  you loved growing up  and that's the guy  you're still kind of  loyal to  right  and i think  i think he's still  pushing the envelope  you know  for new things  for sure  does he still do  new tricks  yeah  yeah  yeah there's some  magicians that do  those huge tricks  you know  the the really  giant uh  making the statue  of liberty disappear  and those things  yeah yeah  that was uh  years ago  remember that  brilliant  but those are  um  was that what it was  yeah i think  yes 
[02:35:00]  still amazing  you moved the whole  audience just slightly  to the right  yeah  yeah because he had  the curtain up and stuff  you couldn't look around  the curtain  you would have saw  the statue of liberty  yeah we saw a helicopter  and had spotlights on it  it was gone  okay no he made it  disappear i'm sorry  she ducked  yes  no but it was  hiding behind something  it was brilliant for its  time where you know  he slowly rotated the audience  yeah  and then when they  opened the curtain  the statue of liberty  is gone no it's a little  to the left now  behind the curtain 
[02:35:30]  no i think it was  real magic  yes it was real  she was in on a  you know what they say  uh  they always say  there's no camera tricks  and we just intuitively  believe that  that's true  instead of saying  why wouldn't they  i would if i were them  right  what the cameraman's  gonna i'll tell  yeah use it to your  advantage right  yeah  why not  yeah there have been  certain uh  tv productions  that i've seen  that you know  they enhance the trick  with yeah some plants  or something like that 
[02:36:00]  you know what do you  got some doubles  it's a show  i saw one on dancing  with the stars recently  what were they doing  and somebody told me  how they did it  i'm like oh  but when you  when they were just  changing outfits  costumes really quick  i guess for a magician  you'd laugh at that  but like you know  for you know myself  just a guy with a huge  dick it's like  that is amazing  to watch  but when you see  how they do it  like oh that's  the genius sometimes  is in how you  construct these tricks  like it's like  what brilliant mind  came up with that  it's true 
[02:36:30]  it takes you know  constructing a new trick  takes a long time  and it you know  at the end  when you see it  all come out  and it's only maybe  30 seconds a minute  uh you don't realize  the amount of work  that goes into  because in reality  it's it's sort of  one of those arts  where you're  concealing everything  so the best  the best effect  the best trick  is one where you  don't see anything  at all  so and that's hard  to do it's hard  to conceal the whole  work  yeah that does  seem to be uh  something that's  happening in magic  today i've noticed 
[02:37:00]  is uh it being  very fast  right something  if something's  getting getting  covered up  and then it's  uncovered within a  second and there's  something there that  wasn't or that  something's gone  uh where in the  old days you'd you  know set up the  curtain the guy  would be yeah  you do a little  dance number  curtains like  moving and stuff  you can tell that  they're moving the  elephant in  yeah something's  you can hear it  now i've seen guys  take you know the  hoop with the  material on it 
[02:37:30]  lift it up over a  girl immediately  drop it and there's  somebody else standing  there or she's gone  or something and that  that shit i think is  amazing you nailed it  the quickness of the  tricks the quickness  now is i mean i think  it's a product of our  attention spans you  know yeah yeah yeah  we need to see quicker  i want to see that i'm  getting bored with this  old guy slapping you  got another trick for uh  jimmy  yeah sure do you uh  do you have a dollar  bill oh we work at  sirius xm exactly  that's all i have  dollar bill we'll 
[02:38:00]  flatten that out okay  and i'll actually use  one of your sharpies if  you can grab it for me  oh there's a sharpie  and uh we can stand up  again if you don't  all right this isn't  gonna hurt is it uh  maybe all right it's a  long childhood of saying  that uh what i want you  to do is can you uh  take the sharpie and  uh sign your name on the  back of the bill okay  that's against the law  sir that's right and  take a nice good look  at that yeah yeah  cool and you can cap  that so the reason i 
[02:38:30]  have you write your name  on the bill is so sorry  it's so that you know  that it's it's yours okay  right and the other  reason uh they have it  so you know there's only  one like it in the whole  world i can't duplicate  yes there's only one  bill and the other way  to know that there's a  the bill is the only one  in the whole world is by  the serial number in this  case it's l zero seven  five something whatever  right um on here you  see this little insignia  it's the l yes it's the  first letter in that  serial number as well  okay what i want you to  do is hold that uh that  that one right there  hold real tight watch 
[02:39:00]  jimmy's holding the  corner of the dollar if  i rub the ink slightly on  the bill just rub it  can actually cause it to  heat up a little bit  he's rubbing that l symbol  with his thumb move it  right  where did he go  he's moving us  wait a minute  he moved the l  make sure your signature  is still on there  yeah it still is  wait wait 
[02:39:30]  that  he moved the fucking  i don't know how he  moved the and it's like  right in front of our  face  the l the l is moved  and it was right in front  of your face  the l is moved  the l is moved  but i'm out of buck  he moved the whole thing  over i don't wait that  was your book to begin with  yeah  what the  can i keep it  yeah 
[02:40:00]  thanks  what  he had to do it  that's amazing  that's amazing  that's amazing  is this no good anymore  switcheroo  well i mean technically  but you can still spend it  no one's gonna be  no it's a dollar  what do you think  what do you think  switcheroo the dollar  you confused uh jimmy  i'm amazed at that  yeah that's pretty cool  it's fucking  wait get my face in it  so i can get some press  but it was right there  hold on get both of those 
[02:40:30]  it was right there  we saw it  he didn't change it  he didn't  he  i saw him holding that  dollar  and i saw  and i saw the l there  and i saw the l  and then he's  he's moving his thumb  around on it  and then slid it over  the dollar  you can't do that  it physically doesn't work  all right  it's some type of wizardry  burn him  i did see  i did see  he's the magic man 
[02:41:00]  i did see the dollar  thing  go from here to there  yes  and it's that's impossible  i don't want a broken dollar  you got one  that is cool as hell  i i'm bamboozled  boggled and bewildered  as to how that was done  i know how he did it  oh do you  yeah i do  you're such a liar liar  pants aflame  because  i saw it  i saw it here first 
[02:41:30]  that thing was here  it was there  i saw it  all right  then we'll be back then  i don't want to move it back  i don't know how to do it  it's not going anywhere  it's fucking  it's a dollar  so jimmy's trying  but he doesn't have the magic  you need the magic to be able to  yeah you need to go  that's that's great dan  that's that's pretty cool  no one's gonna take my dollar now  hi  could you do  i'll be like  what did you put the L there for  they wouldn't notice  i'd be like a man  using magic  i don't think  i'll give this to a stripper  watch i get arrested  i don't think we explain the show 
[02:42:00]  uh properly there dan  i want to make sure people  you know check out your show  so you go to nepal  right  and you check out  kind of their local magic  right  and that's basically  what the show's about  i wanted to find the roots of magic  and i wanted to find people  who are doing it  sort of in the real world  in in you know  the roots of it  doing the real stuff  and uh  i go over to nepal  and find some interesting characters  and find a  a monk that's got these  these crazy powers  and check him out  and do some  do some things with them  all the while  doing magic for  the people along the way 
[02:42:30]  and uh  it's a really beautiful show  like it ended up  turning out really  colorful and vibrant  and you know  getting a really good taste  of another culture  and seeing  magic that we know  and that we've seen  and doing it for  for people over there  how do they  uh react to it  good actually  a lot of the  a lot of times i would do it  they would swarm me  like  and i don't know what it is  about the culture over there  but i would start doing magic  and  immediately i'd have a crowd  of a hundred people around me  and i would try to go to the bathroom  or take a break 
[02:43:00]  or i was always surrounded by  like a donut of people  no matter where i went  and uh  you know  they're all just waiting for  for another trip  they liked it  yeah they liked it a lot  are you  where are you  where is your family from nepal  is that why you went or no  no no no  i'm originally  i'm from philadelphia actually  oh so  but why nepal  uh because of the fact  that they've got this uh  sort of mystical tradition  oh okay  like india  yeah  it's very  well the question is  are you gonna go to other places  or was this a one and done  no i've  you know  we'll see  so uh 
[02:43:30]  i would like to go  oh so this is more of a special  yeah  for discovery  and hopefully  they they realize that  they have something  they they move you around the world  exactly  you should go to thailand  some of the women have  uh great tricks they do there  some of the ping pong ball  or a dart and a straw  yeah  and a balloon  do that  that's what i want to know  how do you push that much air out  i don't think i would enjoy  those tricks at all  no  i'd get a little skeeved out  i enjoyed the dollar thing  even though my dollar is destroyed  no that was uh  really amazing 
[02:44:00]  i i was looking at it  and and it's  it's a seal they put on the dollar  yes  it's that little thing  with the the letter of the mint  that it came from  my father used to do that for a living  he put the dollar seals on  and then he he pushed it  across  yeah  from one side  right over washington's face  and over to the other side  where the little green symbol is  he's not gonna trick me  i got it on film  i'll figure it out  i don't think you will  no  danny's taking a look at it 
[02:44:30]  are you used to people  examining the bills  uh yeah  it goes with your territory  i know  it's it's it's just crazy  that's great  wait a minute  so you had to switch out the dollar  before you signed it  but when i handed it to him  he's he literally  don't blow up his spot  but i i understand  i thought that's the first thing  i thought of  but i handed it to him  and he was standing there  it wasn't like he went out  to the restroom and came back  yeah  no it's it's pretty amazing  and then you were holding it 
[02:45:00]  like as you were holding it  i saw the the dollar there  i saw the same thing  it's  we saw it together like a couple  yes we did like a couple  it's a great fucking  i wish i could do that  no  oh  girls would love me finally  they wanted to lick my stomach  and man  finally  they would just call me magic boy  even though i was out of shape  they'd still sleep with me  hoping my powers would rub off on them  should we get one more trick  before uh dan leaves  if dan wants  what do you want to do dan  um  when is the show on by the way 
[02:45:30]  it's uh wednesday night at 10  on the discovery channel  i'll absolutely  called the supernaturalist  my fucking horrible accountant  just texts me  i'm on the radio  you know you're doing a show  um  love of cod  yeah i'm gonna keep this  this is kind of a fucking cool little  uh  well you can't spend it  souvenir  i'll spend it  would you be  would you feel bad if i got arrested for spending it  right  uh arrested for spending it  yeah  cool  yeah i don't think you'll be there  stunned and amazed  i'll definitely keep that  i want to do another one 
[02:46:00]  you want to do another one  okay  can you do  can you  remember the asian guy  in uh  the uh  the one who won the competition  oh  in that tree  on the movie yeah  and he was fanning the cards behind like all five fingers with two hands  right  can you do that  no  that's a hard one  yeah  he's  he's probably ambidextrous  probably  you know  i mean the use of both hands  i've referred to myself in other ways as ambidextrous 
[02:46:30]  it's nicer word than the real one  all right  all right we got  one more from dan  okay  dan white in the studio  uh  does anybody have a quarter  oh boy  change  i don't  we don't  we're trying to cover all bases  yes  i'm very fancy man  yeah  i only have bills  exactly  oh bill  uh  danny's got to have a quarter  no  no  it's got a quarter in this place  jesus  oh that just shut down the tricks  wow  i know  serious  the fact that we all have no 
[02:47:00]  yeah  it's a quarter  oh wait a minute  yeah  yeah  something will pop up with one  two dimes and a nickel  just destroys the trick  yeah you can't  you can't lose change  oh that's a good point  that's i guess  that makes sense  because of the sound  yes  yeah  there you go  oh okay  i was asking  was he giving us a quarter  oh no  yeah  he had the quarter  oh who is he  he works for dan  no  we're not taking a quarter  from that guy  no no  we got from that  dude it's a real quarter  i can look at the quarter  all right  so what do we got 
[02:47:30]  we got a quarter  he was asking us  all right  june gave dan white a quarter  same routine  i think dan just wants my autograph  he's embarrassed ass  you're signing everything  exactly  i sign this  jimmy's signing the uh  is that the head side  of the quarter jimmy  yes i am  yes  and i'm even putting a dot  on the neck  oh just to make sure  just that's the extra  the extra proof  but we're gonna need you  to stand up once more  that'll show him  all this exercise  up down  i'm getting in shape  so actually  i don't know if you can  get a shot of that  just so you see 
[02:48:00]  exactly what it looks like  um  do you think we can use you  as well  i've been using him a lot  all right  let's use anthony  we need a greasy italian  we have one  which  what  are you right hand  or left hand  which hand is stronger  right right  right yeah  um hold your right hand  out flat  nothing else in it  correct  yes  all right  and again  yes  remember the uh  yes  the quarter  i want you to let me  move this out of the way  you mean norton quarter  squeeze tight  okay  as tight as you can  squeezing tight  perfect  and i want you to just 
[02:48:30]  imagine for a second  that the quarter  that you can see  through your hand  and you can see the  quarter with his  signature on it  yes  just imagine that  you have x-ray  vision for a second  perfect  and i want you to  imagine the quarter  getting hot  uh oh  okay  just just slightly  warmer  and imagine it's sort  of like looking like  it's like a little red  like if meadow was  heating up it would  get a little red  yeah  do you feel anything  getting warmer in your  hand  uh not not really  not really yet  okay  no  good  i'm just gonna pass 
[02:49:00]  my hands over your  hand  anything yet  no  no  i want you to rub  the coin just a  little bit  just rub it  keep going  now if you're  imagining getting it  hotter  and if i want you to  rub a little bit more  keep rubbing  keep rubbing  and you're gonna feel  it start to  start to move  start to bend  really  do you feel anything 
[02:49:30]  not really  i'll move  move it a little bit  more  okay  all right stop  all right  open your hand  what  how does this  what  the  how's my quarter  bent  it's bent  it's not even  right  this is  and it's your  quarter  you broke my  quarter  you sure ruin a lot  of money  yeah i know  wow that's uh 
[02:50:00]  pretty impressive  fuck man  this guy knows how  to do magic  it's probably just  anthony and his big  strong dick  grabbing hands  i bet he wasn't even  supposed to do that  i bet you clumsy  anthony broke it  that's amazing  jimmy signed it  that thing was not  bent  no it was not  i believe me  it was a real quarter  you can't just bend  a quarter  like he couldn't just  go and you know  while i'm holding it  right in front of you  i'm gonna bend it  with my bare hands  quarters are pretty  hard to bend  so how the hell  did it bend  why are you  why are you 
[02:50:30]  freaking me out  because magicians  freak me out  it's probably your  big clumsy hands  i bet you did  you think it is  yeah  that was perfect  that was a good  scripture  jimmy flicked the  corner it hit the  microphone and  bounced back  yes  yes  magic  i magically did that  wow you're in  you're in on the  trick  yes i am  but it's a real  quarter dude  it's a legit  quarter  and it's the one  jimmy signed  it is the one i  signed  is the dust still 
[02:51:00]  on there  we had it in  sight the whole  time  and when he put  it in my hand  i saw he had  he did not  switch anything  he didn't put  another thing in  my hand  it was  it's the quarter  that's pretty wild  what the hell's  going on  get it  magic is weird  i know  did you enjoy  having the  the make-believe  guys  they're a bunch  of really  yeah  that was a  great documentary  that girl was  so hot  well  yeah  jesus i mean  come on

[02:55:30]  is it  bigger  than  a bread  box  yeah  i'd have to  say the  berlin wall  you knew the  whole fucking  time  yes i did  just a  dick  how do i put up  with this shit  i heard it earlier  today we were  talking  before the show  your acting is  quite extraordinary  i was trying  your acting has 
[02:56:00]  gotten very very  good  yeah she's in  love with a  with the berlin  wall  that's a  dummy  she can't even  fuck it  what attracts me  to the berlin  wall  is that  these people  should just be  what attracts me  you're right  to the berlin  wall  i get more  frustrated that  the person  that has either  the video camera  or whatever  just listens  like oh really  they really want  to know why  instead of going  you're a fucking  asshole  they don't beat  them with the  camera  they take it 
[02:56:30]  as like a  serious  like serious  journalism  yeah  here's an  object  that has been  created  to do a  purpose  that everyone  detests  i feel how  hungry you are  to be loved  with an open  heart  not with a  chisel and  hammer  erica eiffel  first had  feelings for the  wall back in  1985  i love you  and i will  stand  they really need  music  come on  i love you  and i will  stand by  what a 
[02:57:00]  dunce  this woman  is an  absolute  asshole  there's no  other way to  spin it jimmy  dude  there's no  other way  let's get down  to brass tacks  okay  when you remove  all the  pomp and  circumstance  she's simply  an asshole  there's no  other way to  spin it  lady  you're an  asshole  so why can't  the guy say  that  because he  probably knows  he's getting  gold out of  this fucking 
[02:57:30]  boob  true  then at  the end  call her  an  asshole  on the  way out  thanks a lot  asshole  after she  signs  thank you  asshole  oh one  other thing  you're an  asshole  how big is  the berlin wall  it's uh  do we know  honestly  it's a couple  hundred yards  it's gone  how big was  it  it's like a  piece left  i think  is a memorial  how big was  the wall  oh it was  it went across  berlin  don't they  still have  it's separate  don't they  east from west  they have parts 
[02:58:00]  of it still up  just as a  tourist attraction  memorials and  tourist attraction  wow  shit like that  it's not serving  its purpose anymore  but no  only for really  dumb people  yeah they could  go around  the one piece  but they clamber  over it  she just looks  like an idiot  she looks like  a tool  can we play  from there  uh yeah  where are we at  honestly  i don't know  i just want to  hear her talking  about 22 seconds  look at her  dumb face  yeah because  i want to see  what she looks  like 
[02:58:30]  yeah  erica eiffel  first had feelings  for the wall  back in 1985  i love you  and i will stand  by your side  she's petting  her passion  grew so strong  that in 2008  she moved  from the united  states to be  closer to it  erica doesn't  just like the  wall  she's kissing  the wall  she loves it  i felt that the  brown wall  was an object 
[02:59:00]  that needed  love  and was hungry  for love  and i couldn't  help but feel  that i was the  one  to bring this  old  scarred  wow  you think she  rubs something  on her body  oh god  i mean she  says she's  in love  with it  and i don't  know i see  her kissing  it  but i don't  know if  they could  show the  true extent  of her  love  that fucking  horrible  stupid  yoko ono  hat and  glasses she  has on  yeah  she probably  does she  probably stands  against the  wall  and she 
[02:59:30]  probably  she probably  rubs her hips  back and forth  and gets her  all over the  wall  that was much  funnier for me  because i got to  see jimmy spit  atomize all over  the microphone  that was a good  one  you think she's  just rubbing her  pussy all over  the place  yeah sometimes  the woman just  wants to get  down there and  lather up and  rub her  cunt  that hurts my  throat  pussies easier 
[03:00:00]  throw a curveball  oh that's me  yeah  she's stroking  the wall  exactly  well that's not  the sign of  somebody who  was molested  no  who can just  zone out  and look at  a wall  and love it  that's not what  she looked at  as a fucking  uncle or a  father was  deep dick in  her  she didn't  just look at  the wall  as solitude  look at how  big it is  painted  oh and it 
[03:00:30]  won't hurt me  it won't fuck  my rump  like the mean  man behind me  I know the  flow chart  all to molested  the woman  loves the wall  why are you  doing my part  I wanted to do  it today  she loves the  wall  flow chart  goes to  molestation  it was  have to though  what else  could it be  here's what  it was  she was  probably  bent over  the bed  her little  fucking  face  half on the  side of the  comforter  and it was  like  and she  smelled the  liquor breath  and felt the  fucking same  stubble that  fucking  Liza Minnelli's  father had an  Arthur on her 
[03:01:00]  neck  she probably  looked at the  no dick  having wall  that's why  she likes it  there's no  cock sticking  off it  it can't  hurt her  she probably  was raised  in a studio  apartment  and wished  that she  had walls  to protect  her  poor  poor gal  yeah maybe  maybe she  was  the wall  would protect  her from  the invading  cock  she needs  the wall  between her  and the dick  she would look  at the wall  and just talk  to it  you wouldn't  fuck my  bottom  would you  and the wall  just chipped  what's that  and painted  and peeled  and cracked  bottom  her bottom 
[03:01:30]  was being invaded  her uncle  was probably  drunken  but it was  thicker than  the average  man's penis  but how does  an objectum  sexual  have an  intimate  relationship  when their  lover  is a very  public object  erica's  solution  is to keep  a series  of models  in her  lover's  image  she even  takes her  favorite  model  to bed  he's 
[03:02:00]  sort of  like  my  main  model  the one  that I  kind of  use  as my  extension  I'm getting  so fucking  mad  I'd like  to eat  her pussy  once  and she'd  be like  oh my god  I want to  go out  with you  first thing  let's get rid  of all this  wall shit  you think  she likes  pink  all in all  listen to  the words  I know 
[03:02:30]  the songs  we know  it  Humpty Dumpty  shouldn't have  been up there  anyway  exactly  it was hurting  the wall's  head  you want to  do our  wall bit  she likes  wall of voodoo  what else  fucking  Johnny Cash  is the wall  right  there's not a lot  it ends there  wall-y  dumb  bitch  wall-y world  is where she  wished she lived  because there was  a whole world  of walls  why don't she  fucking pick up  the pieces of  the wall  and sleep with  that shit  she doesn't even  fucking acknowledge 
[03:03:00]  walt  she just calls it  the wall  whitman bridge  she fucking  drops the t  you know what her  favorite store is  walmart  she probably was so  disappointed when she  finally walked into one  hey that's false  advertising  what are all these  other objects and  items doing here  i thought you sold  a bunch of walls  this is walmart  it's like if i went to  twinkie mart  they'd sell twinkies  and like no you don't  understand  you psychotic cunt  she is a fucking  lunatic  she has a wall  a piece of like  it's a model of the 
[03:03:30]  wall in her bed  and it was covered  with something  yeah right  like boxer shorts  or something  but yeah  if i broke into her  house like as a  fucking armed invader  i wouldn't even rape  her i would just tie  her up and break all  of her wall stuff  and fucking desecrate  the wall  over her head  yeah  bring a sled  down on it  across her teeth  so now she's going  to bed with a  not even the actual  wall a model  of the wall  and we have to  humor these people 
[03:04:00]  so in other words  when i'm with this  model it is more  like i feel like  i'm with him  him  the wall  she's really stupid  looking  common practice  for objectum sexual  or os people  who love public  objects  what a dork  with glasses  they will  i'm gonna see the  object like a muse  they'll take  photographs  or build models  they'll write  they'll do all  kinds of things  to celebrate their  relationship with  the object  good point dr amy marsh 
[03:04:30]  she's sleeping  when it comes to  having sex with her  lover  spooning with it  erica prefers  it's not her lover  it's a piece of  fucking wall  she doesn't give  the details  it's very easy  for people to  get these images  in their head  can i ask a question  for her  erica can we ask  you how do you  make love  to the wall  do you stand it up  and then just lower  your cunt until  it hits the floor  and go  i'd love to just  ask completely  vulgar questions  do you ever lick  the whole wall  like it's perhaps  a big giant  fucking cock  do you ever do that 
[03:05:00]  like  you set the question  up right  and then you  verbally gut punch  her at the end  jimmy i got a  question for you  sure  um  you think she  likes uh  the walls  this woman  i'm really  confused by her  uh  this woman  i would have  to say  doesn't  she doesn't  like  the wall  what  wow  she loves it 
[03:05:30]  they do say  that  what  she doesn't  like the wall  she loves it  oh really  yeah  i was kind of  surprised no one  no one  i didn't pick  them on  it's monday  and then you  got the  erica prefers  not to go  into detail  to go into  detail  it's very easy  for people to  get these images  in their head  of okay  woman and  wall  how does  that work  drill a hole  in it 
[03:06:00]  glory  and the details  are between  us  us  and what  is intimate  for us  might not  even be  considered  intimate  for humans  she is so  lucky she's  not in my  family  we wouldn't  put up  with this  shit  i'd love  to take  that piece  of wall  she sleeps  with  right  and wind  up  just  wind  way  the fuck  back  right  across  the side  of her  head  oh i'm  sorry  it's between  you and  the wall  oh i'm  sorry that i  went too  far asking 
[03:06:30]  about this  you know how  mad she would  have been at  your father  for sullying  a good wall  with some  spaghetti  yes  if she gets  stuck in a  rock and a  hard place  is that a  threesome  you think  she just  rubs her  pussy up  and down  of course  she does  she butt  rubs with  it  she probably  takes the  corner of it  and just rubs  her little  dumb click  thank god  you're not  older and  raping  she gets  it between  her legs  and fucking  rides  dumb little  wall model  she's just  an asshole  deal with 
[03:07:00]  these fucking  people  stop coddling  them  crazy  through my  soup out  thank you  hey we got  line of the  day time  line of the  day  I'm ready  yeah let's  do line of  the day  line of the  day  two runners  up  two runners  up  are we done  with the  wall lady  I don't know  fuck her  I hope she's  killed  I hope she's  killed in a  really tragic  accident  oh yes  and why didn't  they talk to  one family  member because  they're not  putting up with  her shit  exactly  they're all  having sex with  stoops and  doors 
[03:07:30]  stoop  she should  really get  killed in the  controlled  demolition  it would be  great if like  she's kissing  the wall  gently and  it just  falls over  on her  yeah  crushes her  like an  Amish  fucking  barn door  crushes  that bitch  and her  fucking  if the wall  falls on her  so hard  her nose  is forced  back into  her head  and it  shoots  at her  vagina  like a  bottle rocket  the wall  made her  nose  shoot at  her pussy  that's just  vulgar  not even  that funny
