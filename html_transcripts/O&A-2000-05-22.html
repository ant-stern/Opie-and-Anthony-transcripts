<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a lengthy promotion of their upcoming road show at the South Beach Water Club (formerly Speaks) in Island Park, Long Island.  The show, scheduled for Thursday, doors at 2 pm, show at 3 pm, was 21+ and boasted a lineup including Otto, George, Jeff Norris, Steven Lynch, and possibly Jim Brewer. The event promised a wet t-shirt contest with significant cash prizes (funded by the program director), an "ugly ass" competition, a "best sign" contest, and the dunking of "Spaz" in a tank (with listener suggestions for adding animals like crabs or a crocodile).  Opie's brother was set to perform his offensive songs, including "Oh, Mind Fuhrer" and "Columbine," and the Invisible Man would also be in attendance. Opie and Anthony planned to personally control wet t-shirt contest entries, prioritizing women.  The hosts also discussed the Knicks' playoff victory over the Miami Heat, focusing on Patrick Ewing's performance, interspersed with crude humor and expletives.  A discussion of a "Brady Bunch" movie scene featuring Marsha Brady in a bathing suit followed, along with details on obtaining their controversial "WOW!" stickers and a scheduled sticker distribution event.

Following a Vermont Teddy Bear Company advertisement, the hosts lamented their poor stock market performance and announced Stockbroker Dave as the next day's guest, promoting the "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money" segment featuring female contestants performing tasks for cash prizes. They explicitly stated a preference for "regular girls," excluding "hookers and pimps."  Listener calls followed, one inquiring about their toll-free number, and others discussing the previous night's wrestling pay-per-view, focusing on the wrestlers' appearances (Jericho's hair, Stephanie McMahon's attire, and The Undertaker's impressive look) and how the show's commentary impacted them.  The road show was again heavily promoted, this time highlighting the planned activities, including the wet t-shirt contest, Spaz's dunk tank, and performances by Fuel and Q. The controversy surrounding the "WOW" stickers and the Staten Island authorities' efforts to remove them from toll booths was discussed, as was a listener announcing their move to California and expressing a desire to meet the hosts and participate in "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money." The segment concluded with a description of the hosts and listeners overloading the Staten Island Live website's chat room.

The next segment delved deeper into the "WOW" sticker controversy and the resulting online battle on SILive.com, featuring calls from various listeners, including "S.I. Queen," who complained about the toll booth stickers and claimed the toll collectors' behavior constituted sexual harassment. This led to a lengthy discussion about an NRA-themed restaurant with offensively humorous menu items.  The road show was once again promoted, this time mentioning Fuel's participation and their offensive song parodies.  The hosts endorsed Rick Lazio for the New York Senate race, discussed the Knicks' win, and advertised SoBe beverages.

A segment focusing on their new sponsor, SoBe Beverages, and a promotion involving caps with hidden messages was followed by a discussion of their sold-out Radio City Music Hall show and an upcoming Roseland Ballroom performance. A bit about a staff member nicknamed "Stinky" and his body odor followed, including a sniffing test by Spaz.  The show continued with a rundown of upcoming concerts (including Fiona Apple), commentary on Kid Rock's appearance on WWF's Raw is War, and a Joe C Saturday Night Live skit. The road show received further promotion, detailing the wet t-shirt contest, Spaz's dunk tank (in a Boy Scout uniform), and musical performances by Fuel and Q, with specific mention of their offensive songs "Baby Raper," "Camp Concentration," "Horny for Little Girls," and "Imagine."  The NRA-themed restaurant bit was revisited, followed by a game called "What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?" featuring listener calls with humorous takeaways from the broadcast.  The show concluded with more promotion of the road show and a giveaway of Warped Tour tickets, and another promotion of the "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What country are you from?  Uh, what?  There ain't no country I ever heard of.  They speak English and what?  Uh, what?  English, mother f***er.  Do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I double dare you, mother f***er.  Say what one more s*** damn time.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy, destroy.  What much?  OPN Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:00:30]  Uh, what?  It's the OPN Anthony Show.  Yes, another fun-filled week of fun and hygiene.  This is going to be the craziest week of radio ever.  Oh, my God.  Let's go on record and just say that.  Yeah.  Phone line is 212-757-1027.  We got, uh, we got the live show Thursday, huh?  Yeah, that's all that matters this week.  That's all that matters this week, Anthony.  Today, tomorrow, Wednesday, who cares? 
[00:01:00]  It's just going to be one big commercial for the road show this coming Thursday.  Adding more, uh, debauchery by the hour for you to check out Thursday.  I'll tell you, I, uh, we barely talked about the road show on Friday, right?  Well, we barely knew about it until Friday.  And late Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  I ran into hundreds of people during the weekend.  And they're all going.  Yeah, everyone's going.  I hope this place can fit, like, 10,000 people.  The word is spreading like wildfire on this road show.  It should be the biggest one yet, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Our record is Mulcahy's, where we squeeze 1,400 people into Mulcahy's.  The place that holds twelves.  It's nay.  All right, so we exaggerate on the radio if the fire marshal's listening.  That's it.  We're going for 2,000 people this Thursday.  Right on the water.  We're going for 2,000 people.  Yeah.  If you don't know the details yet, we're broadcasting live.  Somebody sent an email and said, well, don't you guys broadcast live every day?  Yeah, but we're broadcasting live from the road show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  That's very, very different than the average O&A show.  From the place.  From the place.  Usually, lately, matter of fact, we haven't broadcasted live from the road shows.  No, we just kind of go there after the show and hang out and get loaded.  So we're going to have to make sure we don't curse a lot this Thursday.  Yes.  Because that's a problem.  Oh, the dump guy's going to be back here, though.  Yeah.  That could be a problem if we have a few Budweiser's in us and we're broadcasting live from the road show.  It always is a problem.  All right.  So it's Thursday.  It's going to start at 3.  Doors open at 2. 
[00:02:30]  Better get there before 2, man.  Yeah.  21 and older, please.  A lot of you youngins really pissed off at us, but we'll figure something out for all ages.  Trust me.  Something cool, too.  Don't worry.  Yearning for the old days when it was 18.  Remember drinking age 18, Opie?  You remember that, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was part of that.  Yeah.  I remember turning 18.  Oh, going to all the bars I'd been going to for a couple of years anyway.  Mm-hmm.  The officials, yeah, they're real smart.  They're too smart for us. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  So instead of like 18-year-olds going out and having a few pops, now they go to the clubs and  get some X.  Get some X.  Sure.  That's smart.  That's smart.  Yeah, the X is not as dangerous as beer.  No.  We'll be handing out the X at our beer.  No, of course not.  That's silly.  So, okay.  It's happening Thursday.  Doors open at 2.  If you're 21 and older, please, it's happening at the South Beach Water Club.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of people were asking me, where's the road show Thursday?  Yeah.  All these people that said they're definitely going to be there.  And I'm like, I don't remember. 
[00:03:30]  I don't even know where it is.  I know.  South Beach Water Club.  South Beach Water Club.  50 Broadway.  Island Park.  Okay.  Otto and George, definitely coming.  Jeff Norris, definitely coming.  Steven Lynch, just about definite.  Yeah.  We have...  He always comes.  It is definite.  He'll say yeah.  We're trying to get Jim Brewer to come.  We're going to have the ultimate WOW wet t-shirt contest for cash prizes.  Lots of cash, matter of fact.  Yeah, we were able to actually roll the PD. 
[00:04:00]  Take his personal money out of his wallet.  Yeah, we got some serious cake-age for the girls.  Now, what are we going to do?  Just have the girls sign up when they get there, I guess?  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Oh, and know what we're doing this road show?  We are definitely...  And we're proud enough to say this.  We're definitely going to be working the line and getting all the hot girls into our road show.  Yeah.  We've seen a problem at the last few road shows.  Excess of penis.  Right.  Too much penis.  Much too much penis. 
[00:04:30]  We need some.  Vagina.  Yes.  Here's the Opie and Anthony road show.  Wait a minute.  Penises.  Oh, what's coming in the door?  Penises.  Oh.  Penises.  Oh.  Penises.  Oh, no.  This time?  Vagina.  Yeah.  Vagina.  Yeah.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Ant and I are going to be like those two a-holes outside Studio 54.  Studio 54.  We're just going to be working the line all cocky and stuff.  You got booved.  You get in.  We're like the tools in front of all the clubs. 
[00:05:00]  That's right.  Personally, we'll stand there and handpick people.  Handpick.  So, if you want to get into the road show, just go with a hot lady.  A hot box is your ticket.  Because I'm going to go, excuse me, hot lady, who are your friends?  Oh, I came with these three or four guys.  Mm-hmm.  You're welcome to come in.  They're all cordially invited.  Because you guys bitch and complain that there's not enough vagina at our road shows.  And there have been times we've heard from girls that said, oh, I showed up and I couldn't get in. 
[00:05:30]  Well, people, that isn't going to happen.  Is road show rain or shine?  Yeah.  Whatever, man.  We sure hope it's shine.  Do they still have fun at Woodstock when it rained like a mother for five days?  That's right.  We don't care.  We plan on doing a Woodstock finish.  We're going to burn the place down.  No, of course not.  That's like another silly statement, like saying we're supplying X, Opie.  See, people get the humor because we're so wacky.  No, we wouldn't do that. 
[00:06:00]  Will ONA take care of the NYPD at the road show?  All these questions coming in.  Oh, yeah.  The answer is yes.  Flash your badge.  Flash your badge, you're in.  There's plenty of room.  I mean, 2,000 spots available for this road show.  Get there early.  I also was speaking with my brother last night.  He's showing up with his guitar, and I think he's going to rifle through a few of the inappropriate songs.  The most inappropriate songs contest we had a while back. 
[00:06:30]  Of course, you remember his hit, Oh, Mind Fuhrer.  He'll be doing that one.  He'll be performing Oh, Mind Fuhrer live.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  And he did the other one, too.  Yeah.  What was the other one?  Another hit.  See how quickly we forget?  Well, he has a couple of hits.  Which one?  Columbine?  Yeah, he can do the Columbine song.  The acoustic version.  Of the Columbine song?  Yeah.  Yeah, you'll have him down there doing a few of those.  Well, we need some of the other people that came up with the most offensive songs. 
[00:07:00]  We're having a tough time hunting these people down.  Yeah, where's Fuel?  Where's Fuel?  Where's Q?  We want you guys broadcasting and performing live at our road show this Thursday.  Yeah.  Also, Anthony, we're going to have the spazz dunking tank.  Yeah, this I'm looking forward to.  I'm looking forward to doing this.  You know, the listeners are going to have to wait until I'm through.  Mm-hmm.  And the rest of the staff here.  Yeah.  Spazz in a dunking tank.  What are we going to dress him in?  He can't just be dressed like regular. 
[00:07:30]  We've got to put him maybe in a banana hammock or something ridiculous.  Like some wacky clown outfit or something.  Maybe his Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We'll dunk him.  No, that's a good idea.  Tell him he's got to wear his Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  So we got that.  Oh, we came up with another one on the train on Friday.  Yeah.  Best Sign Contest.  Oh, yeah.  We're very happy with the signage that shows up at these appearances.  A lot of people are pretty funny writing down signs that have to do with the show.  Mm-hmm.  Little cute little lines.  Yeah.  We've seen them all. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, so we'll have a Best Sign Contest as well.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you guys definitely bring the signs to our road shows.  The ball tree at its best.  Yeah, I'm very excited about this one.  This one could be huge.  It's our summer kickoff party, Anthony.  You know what?  It'll probably blow.  You know why?  Why?  Because we're actually planning a few things.  I don't think we've ever taken more than two minutes to think about these things when  we go out on the road.  A lot of questions coming in.  How about Earl at the road show?  No.  Earl could suck my you-know-what.  Screw Earl. 
[00:08:30]  Earl.  The invisible sloth.  I don't acknowledge Earl anymore.  What about the ugly ass competition?  Yeah.  We definitely want to do the ugly ass competition.  If you have an ugly ass and you're willing to go on stage and show about 2,000 people,  come to the road show and sign up for that.  Opie, how about the girls that feel a little slighted with the Wow Wet T-shirt Contest?  You know, we're going to have big money prizes.  And what if they have, like, putrid, disgusting, heinous boobs?  I mean, how are we going to take care of that?  We'll give a special prize to the ugliest set of boobs we can. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  See, ladies?  Now, you don't have to be the buxom, beautiful breasts up on stage because you get up there,  we're going to give cash prizes for the best boobs as voted by the audience.  But also, there will be a booby prize, I guess, for the most putrid boobs as voted by the audience.  Oh, yeah, your brother's other song was Just Bone My Daughter.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he could do that one.  I've done to Pearl Jam's daughter song, Just Bone My Daughter. 
[00:09:30]  Just Bone My Daughter.  It felt good.  We definitely want cue to call and fuel.  We need you guys to perform your most offensive songs at the road show.  Vinny asking, yes, indeed, Vinny, the Invisible Man will be there without Earl.  Of course he is a member of this show.  He'll be on the stage the entire time.  The whole time.  Probably the only person that won't be kicked off the stage at one point.  Can we have a sign that just says Invisible Man is standing right here?  Right here.  With arrows that point down? 
[00:10:00]  Maybe also we could charge money to have your picture taken with the Invisible Man and give it to a charity.  That's not a bad idea.  Do you know how many people would do that?  Standing under the sign that says The Invisible Man is right here with their arm around him?  Arm around an imaginary guy?  Oh, we've got to do that, man.  That's funny.  Take your picture.  We could have a look at a charity or something.  That's very funny.  I'm the Invisible Man.  The Invisible F-ing Man.  You guys should put live crabs in the Spaz dunk tank.  Oh, that's a good idea. 
[00:10:30]  Great idea.  Let's do that.  Piranha.  We're open for all ideas.  Maybe even a live crocodile.  Look at Spaz trying to get away, and now the croc's in a death row.  We have to do that.  That's good.  We're going to be right near the water.  Let's get a saltwater dunk tank.  I want someone to pull up there with a Sea-Doo, because I've got to tear it up.  Sea-Doo or a Wave Runner or something.  Anything.  Got to get out there.  We're excited for Thursday. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  What other questions could we ask?  The Ugly Ass Competition, Best Signed Contest, Wet T-Shirt Contest.  First prize in that is going to walk away with at least $500, if not more.  Yeah.  What is getting up there with your beautiful boobs?  Let's talk to Kelly real fast.  Kelly, what's going on?  Nothing.  I just want to say hello and want to find out information regarding on Thursday.  This big, huge O&A Roadshow is going to be at the South Beach Water Club, 50 Broadway Island Park. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  Can we say what it used to be called so people actually know?  Yeah.  Remember, it used to be the old Speaks out in Island Park.  They used to do a lot of stuff there, a lot of bands, a lot of...  They did, remember, Paper Bag?  Uh-huh.  That thing that was...  They did that a few years back there.  It's a big place.  Okay.  It's great.  I think everyone...  I'm leaving in a couple of weeks to go in the military, so...  What are you doing?  I'm not going to tell you what, Fred.  Air Force?  No.  Army?  No.  Marines?  I'll just get over it. 
[00:12:00]  Coast Guard.  Coast Guard.  Oh.  I thought you said the military.  Hey!  Come on, I'm kidding.  You're going to have to get that butchy lesbian haircut.  No, no, you don't.  You don't have to anymore?  I checked it in.  I checked it out totally.  So you're going to...  It's cool.  I have long blonde hair.  I'm not getting rid of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Send a picture after they cut that long blonde hair.  Oh, there you go.  Send that off and you're going to be puking off the side of a boat looking for the next  Aelion Gonzalez.  That's my dream.  Well, yeah, join us Thursday for the road show, Kelly.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  This is like my goodbye party.  I'm getting all my friends to go.  All right.  Please get there early.  It's going to be a little crazy.  Oh, I'm leaving like 11.  All right.  Good.  Good.  A lot of people coming in with ideas.  Should I just...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hang up.  Ideas for the spaz dunk tank?  Yeah.  Fill it with gasoline and have them smoking a cigar.  Wouldn't that be an entertaining first hit?  That could be boom.  You killed spaz.  You bastard.  Oh, that's funny.  Let's see.  Okay, good.  Hope you don't get too drunk at the road show. 
[00:13:00]  Game two of the Knicks Pacers is Thursday night.  That's right, Mike.  That's right.  The Knicks pull them on out.  Mike from Manhattan.  He knows.  Against the heat.  All right.  You know what?  We have to take a break.  We'll talk about the Knicks next.  I was even slightly vaguely interested, Opie.  I just got to tell you, which means it was just a fantastic win for the next day.  I was actually minutely interested in the whole thing.  It was exciting.  We'll talk about it next.  How's that?  We're just getting started here, gang.  212-757-1027. 
[00:13:30]  But once again, the road show is happening this Thursday.  Starts at 3.  Doors open at 2.  Get there earlier than 2.  I'm telling you.  21 or older.  It's happening at the South Beach Water Club.  50 Broadway.  Island Park.  I believe the directions are on the WNEW website and the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Yeah.  Which is foundrymusic.com.  Looks like you want to say something, Anthony.  After the break?  No.  Syndication when Van Gundy gets the rest of his hair plugs.  Very good. 
[00:14:00]  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible.  The gun screen is up.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Welcome back to the Mike and the Mad Dog show.  We have a van.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1027.  You've got to give the Knicks a lot of credit. 
[00:14:30]  Coming back the way they did.  Let's go next.  Patrick Ewing, I think he came to play.  He sure did, Mike.  Contrary to Opie's previous statements, the guy came to play.  I think it was obvious.  Yeah, the abuse I'm taking is pretty ugly, hasn't he?  Yeah, people saying you're a fan wagon fan, and you're ripping Ewing a new a-hole every  two minutes, and because of him, the Knicks advance. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I've got to give everyone a chance to abuse me.  Mike from Jersey.  Oh, how much does Ewing suck now?  Without him, they lose and lose big.  34 points and 28 rebounds in the last two wins.  It does not get better, you bandwagon fan.  Ben from Jersey.  Syndication when Riley stops kicking himself in the ass for leaving New York.  Go Knicks.  Quickly, just a little off subject.  Chris from Fairfield talking about Spaz's dunk tank. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  For the Spaz's dunk tank, have electricity running through the water,  and see if Spaz's friend at the power company can turn it off before he hits the wall.  That's pretty good.  All right, you want to talk about Spaz real fast.  Hold on.  Wendy from the city.  You could have the Spaz commute ride as well.  A four-hour roller coaster ride going round and round.  Slapknots from the city.  Is Spaz's forehead the target for the Spaz dunking tank?  Yeah, really.  They better box him in good. 
[00:16:00]  All right, Mark.  What's up, man?  What's up, Opie?  Anthony?  Hi.  Opie, you definitely need to take back some statements you made about Ewing.  And I'll publicly apologize.  You know, I watched the game at the All-Star Cafe yesterday,  and I was really happy that the Knicks won.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But I'm like, oh, why did it have to be Ewing?  The infusion to take on Monday.  Don't take me wrong.  They definitely need a younger, more agile player under the board.  But Ewing was the man.  I mean, he made some key plays.  Game six, game seven, he was the reason they advanced. 
[00:16:30]  What am I going to say today, you know?  The last two games, he played well.  I think Opie ought to stand by his original statements.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, you know, so what?  The guy pulled it out.  But it doesn't make up for a season worth of slottiness.  Yeah, but after a...  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  That's right, bro.  After morning took that chance at the end of the game,  I think even Jeff Van Gundy could have dunked that ball home.  Wasn't it the most lumbering dunk goodness on your life? 
[00:17:00]  I'm like, what is happening to Ewing?  No, he did very well.  He played great.  What can I tell you?  That's Wendy.  All right, man.  Bye.  And, well, everyone wants to abuse me.  Here, let's go to Wayne real fast.  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Great.  Listen, what the hell is this that you're telling me  that the Knicks are going to lose on Friday,  you're disinuing, and you call yourself a Knicks fan?  Yeah, you're right.  I didn't feel good about the Knicks winning the last two games.  I'm sorry.  You think I'm the only one out there?  You forfeited your right to support them.  No, I don't think I'm the only one out there. 
[00:17:30]  But as a diehard Ranger fan and Giant fan, too,  I suffer with these teams.  I suffer with the Rangers every freaking night for a year,  and the Giants, for the past 20 years, I've been alive.  Someone asked me, and I said,  I just don't feel good about the series.  The Knicks on Friday, how many points did they have for the half?  30?  Yeah.  30, they're down 18?  They were down 15.  They came out of there like a house of freaking fire.  I turned off the game.  I was so frustrated.  And then I flipped back.  And you're unfair with a fan.  Then I flipped back.  I'm like, oh, my God, it's a game again.  Yeah.  It is with New York teams.  They always make it interesting.  Name one New York team. 
[00:18:00]  I just got so pissed off Friday.  I'm like, they're not even playing.  They didn't come to play.  I know.  My aunt down in Florida is hanging on her Knicks signs all over the place down in Miami.  She hates the heat.  Her license plate says, go Knicks.  You know what it is?  The Knicks can't truly disappoint their fans unless they do it in the finals.  Oh, come on.  What?  Come on.  Cut it out, Aunt.  Aunt just doesn't care.  I so don't care.  Don't point us all away.  All right.  Oh, syndication when Spaz gets a break.  Thank you, Wayne.  Oh, please. 
[00:18:30]  We'd like some light at the end of the tunnel.  Mike from Jersey.  Syndication when Chris Dudley gets off the bench.  Hey, guys.  Joe from Manhattan writes, am I the only one who noticed that hot piece of ass in the green  dress in the stands behind Van Gundy at the end of the game?  No.  Everyone saw her.  I couldn't get enough of the replay of the final seconds just to see her.  All right.  This is the best instant feedback that has to do with the Knicks today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Alex from Peekskill writes, at the end of the Knicks' Heat game yesterday, you could 
[00:19:00]  hear Jeff Van Gundy as he turned to the Heat fans and said, look what I did to you again.  Again.  Boy, he's got that Barbie doll hairdo.  Oh, my God.  What happened there?  I don't know.  I guess he just gave up on the plugs because he's had that look for like two or three years  now.  What happened?  You know what I think happens to some people?  They start losing their hair.  They get these hair plugs, and it must fill out the area, but then the rest of the hair 
[00:19:30]  that isn't plugs falls out anyway, and then you wind up only having the plugs left.  It's ridiculous.  But he's had enough time to get more plugs put in.  I guess not.  That's driving an old Honda.  You know all these ratty clothes he wears?  I say a lot of crap about Ewing, but I won't say a bad thing about Jeff Van Gundy.  I love the guy.  He's just a mess out there.  He looks like he's 55.  He's only our age. 
[00:20:00]  He's like in his late 30s.  That's all he is, right?  He looks like a rat.  I don't even think he's 40 yet.  Early 40s?  Like 41, 42?  All right.  Wow.  His suits are all wrinkly and stuff.  I swear to God, he looks like your old, maybe junior high math teacher that would come  running into class with a briefcase from the 50s, greasy hair with dandruff on his shoulders,  back of his collar's black.  Yeah.  It's like everyone had a teacher like that.  It looks like he hasn't slept in months. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  You got Riley on the other side.  He's all tanned.  Oh, he's cute.  He's back with the, what, $2,000 suits and stuff?  Nice suit.  All creased and everything.  Guys in cheer.  But now he, you know, there's plenty of time to look at his clothes.  Yeah.  And Van Gundy drives the, what, the 95 Honda Civic that went airborne the other day?  Yeah.  Joe from Jersey.  Syndication when Van Gundy buys a Mercedes-Benz like the rest of his players.  Yeah, that must be funny.  All of his players driving all these Mercedes, nice cars. 
[00:21:00]  He makes what, two mil?  He makes two mil a year, yeah.  Was he ever married?  Because that's only one mil.  And if he was married, if he was married twice, forget about it.  Mike, what's going on?  Maybe that's what happened to his plugs.  Hey.  She got custody of half of his plugs.  What do you got, Mike?  First of all, I want to say I can't wait for Thursday.  Okay.  And second of all, did you see Riley in the press conference with his hand in his, 
[00:21:30]  just staring at his hands, not even looking up, ready to cry, like a little baby?  I'm sick of all these losing teams blaming the officiating, too, man.  Sick of it.  Did the officials get in the way of mourning on that last play of the game?  They almost ripped us off in game three over the backboard shot.  Right, exactly.  We should have won that game.  Well, all right, guys.  I'll see you Thursday and enjoy.  What do you think about Ewing, man?  Ewing? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It's a love-hate relationship.  Yeah, you got...  That's right.  He'll piss...  There's no other way to describe it.  He'll probably piss us off tomorrow night.  I'm sure he will.  Well, until then, guys, good luck.  All right, man.  Peace out.  Thank you.  Peace out.  Tom, what's going on?  Where's Opie?  Right here.  Opie, you prick.  Every year, you're always bitching and complaining about Ewing. 
[00:22:30]  Last year, I called you up.  I told you you were a dingus because you changed sides all of a sudden.  You're like, oh, well, maybe Ewing isn't that bad anymore.  No, I...  He proves you wrong again.  Let me tell you something.  I'm still not a Ewing fan.  No, I don't want you to be.  And how could you say I'm wrong about Ewing?  I just want you to be consistent.  Dude, he's been in this town 15 years.  How many rings do we have?  Oh, hopefully this year, but you have to wake up.  All right, you know.  I know, it's not a reality.  You ain't gonna have.  The last two games, he played great, but I'm not on the Ewing bandwagon. 
[00:23:00]  I'm talking about last year, I guess it was against the Paces, and you were like, oh,  well, he had a stellar performance out there.  And me and Anthony busted on your chops for like about five straight minutes.  I think you cut me off, but then Anthony helped me out.  I don't think...  He busted on your back.  Anthony wouldn't help you out because he doesn't know anything about basketball.  He could care less.  Yeah, I know, but you're like...  I know just enough to hang you out to dry sometimes, Opie.  That's always a good thing.  Guys, you've got a great show.  I was wondering if you, Anthony, could you do Jesus is Over Here?  What?  Just one. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, well, you mean Dice, Finding the Lord?  Jesus is Over Here!  No, no, no.  See, you're not sincere enough.  When I found Christ, you know, the love of Christ, Christ is in my heart.  Christ is over here now.  Okay?  All right, Tom?  All right.  Don't joke about the Lord Jesus.  All right.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, Tom.  That'll be the day.  Charles Darwin checking in, Anthony.  Darwin?  Yes.  From the distance cast.  This can't be good. 
[00:24:00]  Syndication when Ewing evolves into a man.  That old gag.  So you saw the game, huh?  Part of it?  No, I saw part of it.  You couldn't get away from it.  Everywhere you went, it was on.  I went to go to Siemens Furniture Store.  Today only at Siemens.  Sale prices.  This weekend only.  Remember that guy?  Buy a couch, a sofa, love seat. 
[00:24:30]  For the lowest prices anywhere at Siemens.  Today only.  From 11 o'clock to 1101.  Sale prices.  That no one can deny.  At Siemens.  Yeah, I went over there and, boy, what a set of balls.  There was this black guy right out in front of Siemens with a station wagon and a pile of flyers to another furniture store.  Going, yo, man, it's right down the road, man.  Right down the road.  And he's handing it out to people that are walking into Siemens. 
[00:25:00]  But he, the reason I bring it up, he had the game on.  Like in his station wagon.  He's listening to it and watching it.  Everybody.  The whiz, all the TV screens had it on.  You couldn't get away from it.  Times Square was insane after the game last night.  Yeah.  Insane.  People were just screaming and yelling.  Everyone was beeping their horns.  Ah.  See, if it was the old Times Square, I would think something else was going on.  But the brand new Times Square.  No, they were celebrating a Nick victory. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  It was crazy.  It would have been gunfire and hookers.  Yeah.  Back in the good old days.  That's right.  Why did I have to do that?  Why did I have to clean up?  I need cash now more than ever.  And I can't even find it.  I replayed it.  Peep World.  Tom, you're next on WNEW.  Thank you.  Yo, man.  Nick's are not the but carjackers and Patrick Ewing's an eight.  Oh, boy.  That old gag.  That old gag.  You waited a long time for that. 
[00:26:00]  You've got to come up with something new on that.  Yo, the only reason Patrick Ewing's here is because the co-hanger missed him.  All right, Tom.  That was great.  Thank you.  Go back to listening to Hot 97.  Very funny.  Funny, funny stuff.  Mwah.  A lot of people trying to abuse Ewing.  You've got to give him his props.  Wow, look at you.  What are you going to say, man?  He makes the winning bucket.  He had two really strong games.  Doesn't mean I'm a Ewing supporter.  I do hate Riley more than Ewing, though.  Here's a guy begging Ewing to retire. 
[00:26:30]  Jacob.  Oh, and A.  Yes.  Yeah, I want to make a plea for Ewing to retire at the end of this season.  No more.  Well.  No more.  With the amount of money that this guy's getting paid, we can get two hot young stars to fill  his place.  I completely agree, but now we've got to see how far we can go with this damn team.  He's sucking up all the team's resources for years.  For many years.  Yep. 
[00:27:00]  You see, the Nets got the first pick in the draft, huh?  Yeah, and all I know is when they won, I couldn't stop thinking about that girl in the green  top standing behind Van Gundy.  That was amazing.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  And they kept playing it over and over again on the news.  I haven't seen that one.  Damn.  All right, guys.  Syndication monopio is a good impression.  Frank, what's going on?  Oh, what's up, man?  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  The Knicks.  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to happen with the Pacers. 
[00:27:30]  No, they're going to get by the Pacers.  Ewing is just, he's too over it.  I mean, the guy misses so many game-winning shots, and he makes one, and they think he's  king.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, yeah.  I mean, really, he walks off the court in Miami, raising his hands, trying to raise the roof.  Right.  Trying to be a big man, and he misses, he goes 0 for 10.  Well, you know, but everyone remembers your last shot, so you've got to give it to Ewing  right now.  Exactly.  Like you said, on Thursday, we're going to end up hating him.  Yeah.  Don't do something stupid in the Pacers.  How many times did that last shot not work? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, exactly.  Remember the finger roll?  Yeah.  The finger roll.  Let's not forget the 15-foot fadeaway jumper.  Exactly.  I mean, how many things can he do to screw over the Knicks?  Yeah.  Well, he did great yesterday.  They'll be better.  Yeah, well, give credit where credit's due.  They'll be better without him, though, I think.  I did see the dunk, and, you know, I've seen some dunks in my day, even though I'm not  a big basketball fan, and I swear it was the most lumbering, just slow-motion kind of  like no one was really around. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  Well, Maury took a gamble.  He was trying to steal the pass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I mean, it wasn't one of those real high-speed kind of dunks.  It kind of looked a little weak.  We could talk about Ewing's defense.  But he just figures the invisible man will take his man out there.  Let's not forget.  Well, I guess I'm going to have the game-winning shot. 
[00:29:00]  Maria!  Yes, Opie.  Hey.  Opie, I agree with you.  I'm not a big supporter of Ewing.  I think last night he just proved it's better to be lucky than good.  Well, I think, like I said, even Jeff Van Gundy could have made that shot after Mourning  missed the pass.  Well, what the hell?  He has a lot of time now to prove himself, so we'll see.  All right.  And Sprewell at the end of the game.  He was a genius.  The way he stayed in bounds and called timeout, oh, my God, he saved the game.  But he said he never even called timeout.  Well, it doesn't matter.  That's what I mean. 
[00:29:30]  It's better to be lucky than good.  Yeah.  Lonzo Mourning was complaining.  I heard him on the radio today that they're a better team and they should be there, but  oh, well.  Whatever.  That's right.  I love when Riley and Mourning lose, though.  Love it.  And they're the biggest sore losers, too.  Oh, I agree.  They blame everyone except themselves.  Well, Pat can go home and review his wardrobe now.  That's right.  F. Riley.  That's right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Yes, Sprewell's got those light feet, I guess. 
[00:30:00]  He's, I guess, used to not hitting the floor alarms in buildings.  So he can, like, lean.  Why?  Oh, stop it.  Oh, brother.  No joke.  Heema.  Bobby, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  How are you?  I agree with you 100%, O.P.  Yeah, Ewing friggin' sucks, dude.  The guy can't even make a basket if his life depended on it.  He got lucky in that last dunk.  Well, he didn't get lucky.  I mean, that was just, that was just.  It depends on what man could have blocked it. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  In the case of when the Knicks win a championship.  All right.  What are we, not a fan?  All right.  What else we got here?  Bitch Bang from Westbury.  Ewing is like Don Mattingly.  Maybe if Ewing retires, the Knicks will win the championship the next year.  The Yanks did it.  Yeah, poor Mattingly.  After all the years he put in.  He retires and they start winning championships.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, that's enough on the Knicks, right? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  I think we did a good sports break there.  That was a pretty good sports segment, huh?  We'll probably get in trouble, though, for taking listeners away from our sports station.  Oh, please.  They've been talking about the same thing for the last 15 hours.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  NBC.  Yeah, yeah.  NBC's two hot chick shots.  The girl behind Van Gundy and the Marsha Brady.  The girl that played Marsha Brady in the Brady Bunch movie on Sunday.  Uh-huh.  I watched that.  I was switching back and forth from the pay-per-view.  And, uh, I guess we could talk about it after a break or something. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, let's talk about, you watched the Brady movie and you watched wrestling?  Yeah.  It was going back and forth.  I didn't rent wrestling.  We watched Starship Trooper Show.  Great movie.  Let's talk about all that crap next, okay?  Great movie.  Hey, where's this sticker stop today?  Can we start promoting that?  Beaver Street.  We're going to Beaver Street?  Yeah, yeah, Beaver Street.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's Beaver Street? 
[00:32:00]  Right on, man.  Okay, Beaver Street.  Who's going?  Psycho Marx.  All right.  Screw Earl.  Well, we took the box of self-addressed stamped envelopes today and did the job ourselves.  Good.  By the way, a lot of you guys bitching about not getting your Wow! stickers in the mail.  Now we understand why a lot of you guys aren't getting your stickers back.  What did we see just doing that one lousy box of self-addressed stamped envelopes today?  Retards.  Which, by the way, took us a half hour, not all day like other people.  First of all, you can't send your self-addressed stamped envelope, you know, one of those little 
[00:32:30]  envelopes you use to write your, like, aunt in Florida.  Where you fold up your loose-leaf paper four times and fit it in.  These Wow! stickers are pretty big.  Yeah.  Like a legal-sized envelope.  They fit in perfect.  But those little envelopes that you send, yeah, like we just said, a little letter to your  little pen pal in prison.  Those little things.  They don't work!  That your wedding invitation comes in.  You know, the final one that has the directions to the hall in it?  Yeah.  That little one.  They're sending those.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  One guy, he's sending those tiny little envelopes in.  He wants, like, five stickers.  We can't even put a half a sticker in one of those things.  You should cut the stickers to fit in the envelope.  Just cut them in half and throw them in.  I only got an owl sticker, guys.  Could you help me out?  Yeah.  That's another one.  We found another retard that licked and sealed his self-addressed envelope.  Right.  And he sent, so it was sealed.  And then others just flat out not sending self-addressed stamped envelopes and just sending stamps. 
[00:33:30]  Just sending stamps.  One guy addressed his self-addressed stamped envelope to the station.  Right.  So I guess Earl wasn't reading the envelopes that he was getting, so he just shoved the  stickers in and mailed it, and we got it back again.  We open up the envelope and there's wow stickers in it.  It's so funny, man.  So if you get those legal-sized envelopes, no problem.  And we can probably fit, like, four or five in a legal size, okay?  And then there was one person that just wrote a little note with their address and sent a 
[00:34:00]  stamp.  Yeah.  With no envelope.  Yeah.  And now Psycho Mark's writing little notes back to these people.  Yeah.  You effing tool.  So you'll either get a sticker or a very obscene letter from Psycho Mark.  Signed as Earl.  Signed as the Invisible Sloth.  All right.  So if you want a wow sticker, a self-addressed stamped envelope, the legal-sized envelopes  will do the job.  Send it to WNEW, attention wow sticker, 888 7th Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 
[00:34:30]  10106.  And I believe that address is on the NEW website, okay?  Yeah.  But if you're in the area, we're doing that wow sticker stop at Ranch 1 on 24 Beaver Street,  Anthony.  Beaver Street.  Between what, Broadway and...  Broad.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Between Broad and what?  And Whitehall.  Whitehall.  And we'll be there at 5 o'clock today with Psycho Mark, downtown Manhattan, 24 Beaver Street,  Ranch 1 location, okay? 
[00:35:00]  Between Broad and Whitehall.  We'll be there at 5, it looks like.  All right?  Right.  All right, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Your own men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  You're checking out the O&A Show.  We've got to talk about Staten Island in a little bit.  Big controversy over our wow stickers in Staten Island. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, a little problem.  We'll talk about that in a little while, but, uh, Ed?  Yeah.  You teased, uh, right before commercials.  Oh, I did?  You did a little radio tease there.  Very good.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm learning.  Trying to keep, uh...  Learning the craft.  Trying to keep the listeners tuned in.  Yes.  Yeah.  Watched, uh, the Brady Bunch, uh, movie that Barry Williams put together on, uh, Sunday.  It was switching back and forth from the pay-per-view, WWF.  You know, he's, uh, now officially a friend of the show and stuff. 
[00:36:00]  I just didn't have the heart to check it out.  Which is really bad, but...  Well, I just didn't feel like it.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, how was it?  As, as a movie?  Yeah.  It was a little weak.  Yeah.  But as, uh...  A little weak, I mean, it got...  Trash.  I got trash.  Oh, the critics were giving it zero stars.  But, uh, I don't know.  If you grew up watching the show and stuff and you kind of, uh, want to know the ins and  outs, it was kind of entertaining, you know?  Yeah.  As, uh, as far as, uh, facts go, I don't know how factual it was. 
[00:36:30]  Because I, I did read the book he put out and the whole relationship with him and Marsha.  Uh, the movie made a little more of it than it really was, according to his book.  You know, and it was based on the book, so I guess they were trying to get a little  more, uh, actions for, for the movie, so people would watch.  Mm-hmm.  But I gotta tell you, the pool scene, where the chick that was playing Marsha, uh, gets  in the pool with the guy that was playing, uh, Barry, Greg. 
[00:37:00]  She comes out, she's got her bikini top on, and a little, uh, pair of shorts or something  around her waist, and a little wrap thing.  Yeah, a robe, I don't know what it was, but she takes that off, slowly.  The camera, I swear to God, zooms right in on her crotch.  On her camel toe?  It's a full screen crotch shot.  And I don't know how old this girl was.  She didn't look any older than 16.  And, uh, you saw, like, right through the bathing suit, like, every curve, every fold, 
[00:37:30]  everything.  It looked like she was smuggling a yo-yo in the front of her bathing suit.  Oh, a very tight yo-yo.  Yeah.  Yes.  And, I mean, you could see everything.  And, uh, she had a hot little bod on her, you know.  She gets in the pool, she's looking all hot and sexy and everything.  And from what I read in the book, none of that happened.  You know, they have a scene where he climbs into bed with her.  And, uh, he's trying to score.  And they had this whole conversation where she's asking if he loves her and blah, blah, 
[00:38:00]  blah.  And in the book, it just says, yeah, he climbed into bed with her.  She kind of woke up and said, what are you doing?  Get out of here.  And left.  And he left.  And that was it.  Sounds like Erica.  And he groped her and called her baby in that Rockaway bedding bed.  Yeah, but they, uh.  I thought you were talking about Spaz for a minute instead of Barry Williams.  Frank from the Bronx, I used my TiVo to spank one out at the pool scene.  My God, when Marsha's getting into that pool, it rivals the Fast Times pool shot. 
[00:38:30]  It was a great, great shot.  Do we have a copy of this?  I got to check it out.  No, I don't have a copy.  If somebody has a taped copy and they could run a still off and email it to us of her,  uh, the crotch shot.  Mm-hmm.  It's just amazing.  Mm-hmm.  You know the, um, well, you know the, uh, Nikki Cameltoe shots we got on the website?  You've seen them.  Yes, of course.  When Nikki was, uh, we delivered keggers.  Nikki was in the studio.  Mm-hmm.  And Psycho Mark videotaped her crotch from, like, a foot away.  And it takes up the whole screen. 
[00:39:00]  It was that close.  And you could see just as much detail.  Man.  And she's in a little bikini bottom.  Well, Slim Jim, uh, from Manhasset.  Hey, ONA, I watched the Brady thing last night because you had Barry Williams on the show  on Friday.  And, man, am I glad I watched.  The scene with that hot little Marsha chick in the blue bikini is now a permanent fixture  in my spank bubble.  Yeah.  Syndication when Precious makes up with Nana.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  Yeah, so that was, uh, that was a great scene.  That was worth the price of admission right there. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And they did it twice, which was great.  Yeah.  Because it's NBC.  It's regular TV.  And then they have them, uh, leave the pool and they go into Greg's.  Uh, room to listen to some music.  And the parents, Greg's parents are in the living room.  So they start making out and, like, you know, grabbing each other and stuff.  So then, uh, Greg's father comes over and says, come on out.  You know, Mom wants you out here.  So they have to break it up real quick and go outside.  And he goes, Mom just wanted to give you dessert.  So Barry Williams, the guy that's claimed Barry Williams, walks over to get the cake  hunched over. 
[00:40:00]  And his father goes, oh, your, uh, back's a little hunched over, uh, Barry.  Like, oh, yeah.  He's got his shirt pulled out.  When the boy's got his shirt pulled down, he's covering up his, his bone.  He was getting, getting some wood.  Oh, that's funny.  Hey, Vito.  Yeah.  How are you, Vito?  Good.  Hey.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  I was watching that last night.  Yeah.  And when she was taking down those shorts.  Yeah.  That, there was a nice foliage shot she had going on there.  You saw some, uh, hairage. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.  It was, that was a very high pull scene.  Jesus.  I'm waiting for reruns.  He played on that one.  Yeah.  Someone's got to run us off a picture of that.  God damn.  Yeah.  Well, uh, Anthony can bring in tomorrow copy of Brady movie.  So cool.  Someone talk to Anthony on line 11.  We'll take that.  Well, thank you, Vito.  What else was going on in that movie?  Well, the, uh, funny thing also, the Mike Brady stuff.  They explored his, uh, his, uh, his gayness. 
[00:41:00]  His, uh, gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike Brady, uh, turn out, uh, you know, he, he was gay.  Yeah.  Uh, but they didn't really touch on anything.  I mean, he wasn't groping the boys or anything or bringing any dates on the set.  But, uh, the funny thing was when he had the, uh, scenes with Florence Henderson, where  he had a kisser, they would get the scene all set up and they'd be like, okay, uh, action.  Well, that was the only scene I saw.  That's, that's the only scene everyone saw.  That was in the preview.  Yeah.  He'd start kissing and stuff and they go cut.  And he practically pushes Florence Henderson away. 
[00:41:30]  You know, like, uh, okay, are we done?  And they go, well, we might have to do one just to be sure.  Another one.  And he's all, oh, oh, I'm all upset.  I got to kiss a girl.  Jesus.  Yeah.  But, and what about Florence?  Because they, they made Florence Henderson out to be like his whore.  Yeah.  Because he's like, hey, how about a little tongue?  Do you think that something would like that?  Yeah, yeah, slip the tongue and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Wanted to tongue with Mike Brady.  Oh, it looks like she used to go on her day, though.  And then the kissing scene there with Barry Williams.  Uh-huh.  Outside, because they went out on a little date, went out to dinner. 
[00:42:00]  Nothing really developed, uh, as far as that goes, except for some, uh, kissing.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you guys doing?  Great.  Dude, it was terrible.  The only reason I turned in last night was because you guys had Barry Williams on the show.  Yeah.  I was expecting, like, sex and scandal, you know.  And then, like, there's only just a couple of scenes where you get a hint of any of that stuff going on.  The rest is, like, them chasing Tiger around.  Yeah.  So the Brady kids go on parade.  It was absolutely so not worth my time.  Joe, but wasn't the pool scene worth the price of admission? 
[00:42:30]  Hey, look, look.  It was delicious.  I'll admit.  I will admit, but, you know, whatever.  I was expecting a little more on...  What?  It's NBC.  It's like network television.  Yeah, well, I don't know.  Maybe, you know...  What are you going to get?  What Barry was doing in our studio that day with the stripper?  No.  This should have done a lot.  Hey, that would have been fancy.  Oh, man.  Imagine that one.  Hey.  The flying V or whatever it was that you had.  The upside-down V.  Yeah.  Paper view of it.  I would pay the shit.  It's too bad he already filmed the movie.  He could have added that in quickly.  Yeah.  That would help the ratings. 
[00:43:00]  It's a syndication when Anthony's ex gives him back his balls.  Bye.  Bye, Joe.  Hey, just one ball.  It's half.  All right, Anthony, we've got to take a quick break.  A lot of people want to talk about the WWF pay-per-view.  Charlie on line three says that we influenced the WWF pay-per-view.  Huh.  I wonder how we did that.  I don't know.  We'll see what that's about.  And we've got to go to the archives and play the famous Mike Brady bit.  Ah, yes.  One last time before we rest this thing for a while.  Yeah, Mike Brady and all his gain. 
[00:43:30]  Mike Brady under the famous Brady Bunch stairs.  Here he is sucking another man.  No.  Check this out.  We'll be back.  Well, come on, Anthony.  You had the sickest thing today.  What was I doing?  The whole Brady Bunch bit.  What?  I just, it's true.  Mike Brady designed the Brady house.  Right.  And he didn't design any backs on the stairs leading up to the kids' room.  And there was a place where there was bushes under the stairs for someone to hide.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:44:00]  So you thought Mr. Brady was under the stairs checking out his daughters and his sons.  They knew he was.  He designed the house.  There was no cable back then.  Marsha!  Marsha Davy Jones is here for you!  I'm ready!  Marsha!  Ah!  Oh, yeah.  Come on down those stairs.  You hot bitch.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Mike!  What?  Mike!  What do you want?  Can you call Cindy down? 
[00:44:30]  Cindy?  I need Cindy.  Tiger ate the mail again.  Oh, Cindy.  Cindy, come down.  But could you wear that little Shirley Temple outfit you wore with the dress?  Don't be scared.  I'll be right under the stairs.  I'm just under the stairs.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lisp for me.  You're the dirtiest Brady of them all.  He fell.  He fell.  Bite a thief.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  He fell.  Mike!  Mike!  You faghead! 
[00:45:00]  What?  Why are my panties stretched out, Mike?  Why are you asking me?  Alice's fat ass is probably in him.  That's probably it, Mike.  Oh.  Well, I need Jan.  Jan has to come down.  My God, I have to reprimand her for not wearing her glasses.  She could have killed herself.  Oh.  Yeah.  Straight down those stairs.  You little Brady.  Yeah.  You're a filthy Brady girl.  Oh.  Stop on the stairs.  Stop right there. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Dad, can I turn your office into a room for me?  Greg?  Yeah, Dad.  Now, Greg, we're going to have a talk about this because an office is a lot of responsibility.  I want you to come down here and I'll meet you in the office.  Okay.  Come on.  Oh.  Look at that Johnny Bravo ass in those pants.  Dad, can I call you Mike?  Yeah, call me whatever you want. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  I'm going to take you to the Grand Canyon.  Really, Dad?  Yeah.  But I want to sing.  Sing into the microphone, son.  All right.  That's not a microphone.  Oh.  It's winking at me.  Dad, you're Jewish.  Bobby?  Bobby?  Dad, Dad?  Come on down here.  We're going to play on the trampoline.  I wish I was taller.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang on the monkey bars to get taller. 
[00:46:30]  You jump up and down on that trampoline.  I'm looking right up your shorts legs.  Yeah.  Boy, that looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Not a hair on there.  Wow.  You forgot Peter.  Peter!  Peter!  We're all out of pork chops and apple fries.  Oh.  That's okay, Peter. 
[00:47:00]  Come on down.  All right.  Come on down and I'll feed you a sausage.  That's what you want, sausage.  Oh, walk down those stairs.  Look at you.  Wow.  You get an afro just like Dad's.  I bet you have one of those Brady Afros in your pants, too, don't you?  Dad.  It's time to change, isn't it?  Dad.  Dad.  The gin's yelling at me because he's using my hairbrush.  Shut up and get on the bunk bed. 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  Here comes Greg again.  Those are groovy glasses, Greg.  You know, you were caught smoking, but no one has to know.  Well, I won't tell Mom if you just help out old Dad.  It wasn't my jacket, Dad.  It wasn't my jacket.  I don't care.  Why are you putting the jacket over my head?  Oh, we're going to smoke a cigar.  Come here, Greg.  This is a fine cigar.  I call this the Pink Tip White Owl.  You're going to like the draw on this one.  Hi, Mr. Brady.  It's Alice home. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, Sam.  To come over here.  Show me some meat.  All right.  As long as Alice isn't home.  Are we done?  I don't know.  My God.  I was thinking of something for Cousin Oliver, but...  I got thrown because Opie's got the same haircut.  Oliver!  Oliver!  Come on down.  I have to initiate you into the Brady house.  I'm going to go up to look like John Denver.  Oh, there's Greg's mouse that he's using for that little experiment. 
[00:48:30]  Let's make your butt into a habit trail.  Yeah.  Bend over, Oliver.  That's all right.  That's a paper towel tube.  It's okay.  All the Brady kids have done this.  Okay.  Very good.  Can we leave on an up note?  Nope.  Too late.  I doubt it.  Opie and Anthony.  Brilliant radio at its best.  Oh, God!  Help us!  107.  Never do I ever hear.  Let me swallow.  Uh, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, boy.  All right, you know something?  I'm going to leave it alone.  You at home, add your own goofs on Opie right there.  Oh, shut up.  Go ahead.  It's a chicken pot pie.  Oh.  Chicken pot pie!  Is that what you're calling it?  Hey, Opie, Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  We love the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.

[00:51:00]  Tell them, uh, ass-wipe and Anthony sent it.  What other radio show's going to give you, like, uh, intelligent talk about stocks and girls playing what's in my pen?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  107-WNEW.  Yeah, you won't hear us, uh, talking about stocks for a while.  No, especially not today.  I was on the Long Island Railroad coming in to check out the Knick game and stuff.  Felt like, uh, Manhattan was the place to be for the Knick game yesterday. 
[00:51:30]  Talking to one of our listeners on the train.  Well, Opie, the NASDAQ had a huge comeback.  Only down 26 points today.  It was down, like...  At a point, yeah.  They were down, uh, a couple hundred.  Yeah.  And the Dow, uh, down 84.  One guy, uh, well, this guy on the train's like,  you guys, uh, don't talk about stocks anymore.  I'm like, there's nothing to talk about.  We're all getting, like, just slammed.  Hammered.  I can't do anything with my money in the stock market.  I just gotta leave it there and hope for the best.  Can't move any of the money around.  Nothing.  Just stuck. 
[00:52:00]  Nothing's moving, uh, like, fast enough one way or the other.  For me to...  Because I used to play, uh, Yahoo, you know, all the time.  Play the ups and downs.  And it hasn't done those 20-point swings in the one day.  You know, either way, make it worth playing.  So, that's why we're not talking about stocks.  But, Stockbroker Dave coming in tomorrow, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  I haven't been able to call him back,  so if he's listening, uh, in his car right now  as he drives back to Jersey,  or if someone knows, uh, where Dave is, 
[00:52:30]  tell him we need to talk to him.  Tomorrow we want to play, uh,  win Stockbroker Dave's money again, Anthony.  Yeah.  This is a great, great bit on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Stockbroker Dave comes in...  With just a ton of money.  A lot of cash.  The last time we did this,  he gave out well over $200  for doing something really stupid with a wiffle ball bet.  $200?  Dude, as I remember it, he, uh...  It was more than $400?  He shelled out $500 on the counter  and only put $100 back in his pocket.  So, it was like $400?  He spent $400. 
[00:53:00]  And, uh, this girl just made part of a wiffle ball bet disappear.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  And we marked it with the Sharpie,  so we do have the record in case anybody wants to try to beat the record, but...  And not, we're not talking about, you know,  the David Copperfield way of making it disappear.  Yeah.  Although, hmm.  But, no, she definitely made the handle disappear.  So, uh, how does this work, you might ask?  Well, it's very easy.  Stockbroker Dave comes in with just a wad of bills, a ton of money,  and we invite girls to come down in the studio. 
[00:53:30]  A bunch of you.  Uh, ladies, just show up tomorrow,  if you're brave enough,  to try to win some of Stockbroker Dave's money.  Mm-hmm.  And he will suggest things for you to do,  and if you do it,  he will, uh, start peeling off hundreds off this wad of bills.  Now, we're not talking about girls that want to come up here  and show their juggling prowess or anything like that.  Oh, no, it gets pretty intense.  You know, I, I...  Or, or any girls that'll come up and be kind of shy about doing things.  I...  Because it's cold, hard cash, and it's just, uh...  Well, that's, that's the beauty of this. 
[00:54:00]  You get, like, 10 or 12, you know, normal girls  that usually wouldn't do anything crazy like this.  Yeah.  And we see where their line is.  You got the money.  And no hookers and pimps this time.  Yeah, we, we can't, we can't accept hookers and pimps this week.  Where's the money?  Where's the money?  Yeah, that, that, that little midget, uh, pimp from last time.  Stay, stay home.  Stay home, please.  We want regular girls this time.  Yeah.  And we line you up, and then Dave says,  hey, well, I want you to do this,  and, and we see who steps forward for the cash. 
[00:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of cash.  Yeah.  Ladies, if you're having trouble, you know, paying your rent this month.  Paying the rent.  Be close to the station tomorrow, 57th and 7th,  when Dave comes in with his, uh, wad of cash, okay?  I got to pay the rent.  No pimps or hookers, yes.  No.  How are we going to tell, though?  Well, if she comes up with a pimp, it's over.  Uh, let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hello.  Steve from Brooklyn.  Listen, guys, that Brady Bunch thing would qualify as all the things you thought of, 
[00:55:00]  but were afraid to ask.  But, obviously, you guys make rush hour traffic the most bearable freaking thing on earth.  Oh, right on, man.  Thanks a lot.  You know, I have a serious question, though.  Uh-oh.  How come, no, serious.  Serious.  Uh, how come you guys won't get a toll-free number, or is it that you can't?  We do have one.  We got one.  We just don't know what it is.  Oh.  It's 877-NYC-1027. 
[00:55:30]  877-NYC-1027.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  You guys are great.  Very easy.  Best thing that ever happened in New York.  Thank you.  Very easy number to remember.  Oh, yeah.  When did we run out of 800 numbers?  Ah.  Run out of 800 numbers?  They're changing my area code.  I called my brother, who lives a mile from me.  I've got to use a different area code.  Yeah, what's that about?  6-3-1.  6-3-1.  6-3-1, but some of it's still 5-1-6.  That's a pain in the ass.  I can't remember it.  Ugh.  No, my sister lives in Green Lawn.  She's still 5-1-6. 
[00:56:00]  I live in the Huntington area.  It's 6-3-1.  Yeah.  It's a mess.  All right, let's go to Charlie here.  Charlie, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  I've got to congratulate you guys over the wrestling pay-per-view last night.  Yeah?  First, you had Jericho on a while back.  Told him his hair looked like a sperm whale.  He came out new hair.  You guys had Stephanie...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's back up, because that is the God's Iron's truth.  We made fun of Jericho's hair to the point where you could tell during the interview he was  self-conscious about it. 
[00:56:30]  And then the next wrestling event, he completely changed his hair.  He didn't have that pebbles thing anymore.  Pebbles, Flintstones.  We called it a sperm fountain or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sperm fountain out of the top of his head.  All right, and what did Stephanie do last night?  Well, you guys had Stephanie McMahon on, told her that she had to show more cleavage, and  boom, the shirt she's wearing, complete split down the middle.  Yeah.  Really?  She was showing some boobage last night.  Every time I saw her, I was definitely wondering what's in her pants.  And she was wearing the tight black leather pants.  Oh, yeah.  And I was looking to see if she had the flat ass that she had accused us of saying. 
[00:57:00]  What did you think, dude?  She's all right, man.  I actually kind of like the ass.  Yeah, she's gotten better.  It's definitely getting more juice to it.  I just liked her.  She was a lot of fun on Friday on our show.  Until she pulled the thing where she rubbed it on the shirt instead of...  Ah, that's all right, though.  That's okay.  You guys got to watch tonight, man.  There's going to be some stuff going on with Jericho, I think.  Well, speaking of the pay-per-view, The Undertaker coming out at the end of it last night? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, he looked awesome.  Now, let me tell you something.  The last pay-per-view, you had Austin come out, and he looked like a cripple coming onto the stage.  It was so disappointing, so pathetic to watch.  Last night, The Undertaker comes out into the ring at the Triple H and The Rock are going at it for like an hour straight.  He comes out looking huge.  I mean, this guy must have just been on the damn weights and the steroids or something.  The droids.  The droids.  I don't know what he was doing, but he was bigger than ever. 
[00:58:00]  And he was...  Did you see him slam X-Pac?  Oh, he destroyed everybody.  It was amazing.  The guy looked huge.  I'm wondering if he's going to have a satanic biker gang now.  I think they're trying to steer him away from that whole Satan thing.  Now he's just going to be a badass.  He came out on a Harley, right?  Yeah.  He just looked unbelievably huge.  I think it's going to be interesting to watch.  Yeah, but watch Jericho tonight, man.  Yeah, I think it's going to be a good Raw tonight.  Yeah, that last cripple across face was low.  It was a choke.  All right.  Well, thank you, Charlie.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Thanks a lot, guys.  Peace.  Peace.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, you're next on N.E.W.  Ed, did you catch me on the pay-per-view last night?  There was a blonde with giant guns.  Huge.  With a wild sign.  They only showed it like once or twice, though.  I wish I saw that.  They should have showed it all.  She was good.  All right, man.  I missed that.  Communication.  Tool.  Oh, what a tool.  Hey, Tony, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, man?  Last night, Sean Michaels was a guest referee, right? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  He was wearing these shorts, bro.  He looked like the biggest slamer.  You could tell what religion he was from these shorts.  I mean, they all got to wear spandex, right?  But he was wearing a referee shirt with, like, these mini shorts.  Well, he always does that.  He was the biggest friend of Dorothy.  He always does that.  Yeah, he likes those tight shorts for some reason.  I don't get it.  But we saw his wife in California.  Wow.  My God.  Remember, Anthony?  Yeah.  They were in our hotel?  Yep. 
[00:59:30]  She's got the hugest chest I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, and he's got a kid and stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  And the Undertaker, he just joined Hell's Angels.  Hell's Angels, please.  Jeez.  Later, fellas.  All right.  Thank you.  So that was a good pay-per-view, Anthony?  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Action-packed.  All right.  Let's go to Danny real fast.  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, the camera guy is gay.  You saw when they got a close-up on Triple H and The Rock?  You saw the hair on the show like it was bald.  You know what? 
[01:00:00]  That was nasty.  I wish I could understand him, I think.  And I'm like, The Rock, he should have won the belt.  Because the time right now before Undertaker interferes Triple H and Rock's match.  Are you Puerto Rican or Egyptian?  Oh, that's not right.  That's not right.  I'm Puerto Rican.  Oh, Puerto Rican.  What station were you listening to before the O&A show?  Oh, I always listen to your guy.  I just never knew the number because I said it so fast.  Hey, you have a phone to say something, too. 
[01:00:30]  The Rock is a man because he owed WWF.  He had to lose the belt because he's making that movie.  That's why.  Look, look, it's Frank's off the radio in the background.  What a kook.  Kid Rock's on Raw tonight, too, right?  Chris?  Yeah?  Kid Rock's on Raw tonight, right?  Yeah, I heard that he's going to be wrestling with Jericho against Benoit.  I know, it's a week.  Oh, no.  All right, Kid Rock's done. 
[01:01:00]  It's next week?  Next week.  It's next Monday?  Well, that makes it official.  Kid Rock's done.  No, Kid Rock appears on the WWF's Raw's War next Monday.  Oh, it's next Monday?  Yeah.  He better not wrestle, though.  I hate when they do that.  It's done.  The whole Arnold Schwarzenegger wrestling.  That is, you know something?  Anyone who's in the WWF, it's fine.  You work within the WWF.  You make yourself a superstar.  And everyone knows you.  You're very successful.  If you're anyone outside of the WWF, and you turn up on the show, in the ring, doing something, 
[01:01:30]  it's over.  Cindy Lauper.  Remember her?  She's all huge in the early 80s.  With Captain Lou Albano.  And then she gets in the ring.  Gone.  Done.  How about Insane Clown Posse?  Yeah.  They hooked up with those freaks.  Gone.  Done.  Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Arnold, with my movie, End of Days, wonderful, terrific. 
[01:02:00]  Vince, you are a genius.  It's great to be here.  Wonderful.  Did I mention my movie in the last two seconds?  You know, the one no one saw, End of Days, End of Korea.  It's great.  It takes up half a shelf at Blockbuster.  And all of them are there.  Every time I put a Blockbuster, I pass it.  And, like, there's not even an inkling that I'm going to get it.  Yeah.  You know, I just look at it and laugh, because, like, every time I go in there, it's less and  less shelf space.  It's like the first week it's out, it's one whole section.  It's just a wall of boxes. 
[01:02:30]  And meanwhile, you look at, like, Fight Club, every copy is out.  Yeah.  You look at End of Days, and, like, there's one or two missing.  Yeah.  They're stacked up five deep behind every box.  And now I walked in there, you know, the other night over the weekend, and, like, there's  five boxes, End of Days, all of them still there.  Still there.  Poor Arnie.  And he turned up on wrestling.  It's done.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, now, Monkey is saying Kid Rock is performing American Badass, not wrestling. 
[01:03:00]  I just hope he doesn't wrestle.  I don't know.  Steve C. from FoundryMusic.com.  What the F is this little bastard trying to say?  Kid Rock is on Raw, but it's next Monday, and he's not wrestling, just performing because  his new disc is coming out next Tuesday.  Thank you, Steve.  Did you see Edge, Christian, and Kurt Angle when they were making fun of those people  by wearing those hats and had those instruments?  Yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't that good.  All right.  Now, the best part was right at the end. 
[01:03:30]  I'll take it.  Just about it.  All right.  Enough wrestling.  It was good.  Undertaker came back.  He looks huge.  Yeah.  Raw should be good tonight.  That's it.  Okay, Anthony, up next, we're going to talk about our summer kickoff party.  We're doing another road show.  If you haven't heard about it yet, please stick around.  We'll talk about it right after we take a quick break.  And we'll also get into the controversy that's heating up in Staten Island over our WOW stickers, Anthony.  Yes.  All coming up next.

[01:05:30]  Yes.  It's Babbage's GameStop.  You guys have deteriorated.  It's beyond belief right now.  The OBA Anthony Show.  Thank you.  1027 WNAW.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  We've got to talk about the road show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Very excited for this coming Thursday.  It's going to be off the hook.  As they say.  As they say, Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  It's going to be off the hook.  We're very excited about our latest road show.  It's happening this Thursday.  We're broadcasting the whole thing live on the radio.  We haven't broadcasted one of these live in a long time.  No.  Sick.  I don't think we've broadcasted one live since the trade winds about a year ago.  No, there was Webster Hall.  Oh, Webster Hall.  Okay.  Remember that?  That was in what?  September?  September 14th.  September 14th.  You remember the date, huh, Ben?  God, what a fun show that was for me.  That was, uh, I believe that was the day your life changed. 
[01:06:30]  Boy, there's a few people that were there at the end of that show at Webster Hall.  That saw.  Standing around the base of the stage.  That saw.  And I saw life change.  I was talking to a few fans, and they were standing there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Oh.  They saw Wendy in rare form.  They weren't the only ones, though.  No.  We were all checking it out from the balcony. 
[01:07:00]  From the balcony.  It was better than the entire four-hour show with Sammy Aga.  The last three minutes.  Oh.  That was pretty much it.  That was a proverbial straw.  Anyway, we were doing a road show this coming Thursday.  It starts at 3.  Doors open at 2.  21 or older.  We're going to be at the South Beach Water Club, Anthony.  Yeah.  The old Speaks.  Used to be Speaks.  Used to be Industry.  Used to be Industry.  Industry.  That's right.  That's right.  I've used to play both of those places. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know that.  It's 50 Broadway in Island Park.  Who didn't?  50 Broadway in Island Park, South Beach Water Club.  We're opening up Rough Cut.  Equinox.  Don't make fun of the Long Island bands.  Oh, please.  I was there, dude.  I could say whatever the hell I want.  We had some great Long Island bands, didn't we?  Oh, my God.  Tell me what you want.  You're talking about the ones that actually had some type of career when you talk about 
[01:08:00]  Zebra and Twisted.  Stuff like that.  I'm talking about the ones that just never got out of Baby Huey's and the Mad Hatter of  Stony Brook and all those places.  Come on.  I was there.  I smelled enough stale beer in those clubs that it lasted a lifetime.  Frank Cariola's various whorehouses around the island for us to go in, sweat, and get 
[01:08:30]  effed.  So you didn't leave without a dime.  Now you're talking about something I can relate to because I did a lot of the DJ gigs for Mr.  Cariola.  Oh, I think when you wanted to get paid, I think he couldn't hear you from all the hair  growing out of his ears.  Remember the black hair that was shitting out of his ears?  Oh, my God.  What the hell was that?  That was alien.  Not just a couple.  It was a whole damn hair bush.  Hey, Frank, can we get paid?  No.  What?  Oh, you only had two people in there.  No, Frank, the place was packed.  All my friends were down here and everything.  Oh, no, look.  The doorman says only two people came for you guys. 
[01:09:00]  Two people only came for every band.  How come there were like 250 people in the club, Frank?  Like, jeez, you'd think he would be happy with the $8 beer prices.  Yeah.  You know, give the band the door?  Yeah.  I wonder if he's still kicking.  I'm sure he's somewhere.  Jesus.  Anyway, Anthony, Roadshow Thursday.  Yeah.  Starts at 3, like I said.  Doors open at 2.  21 or older.  Get there early, man.  I'm telling you. 
[01:09:30]  It fits 2,000.  We're going for 2,000 people this time.  Yeah, let's go.  We're bringing a kiddie pool now.  We're adding stuff as we go along here.  On stage.  All right, so it's at the South Beach Water Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park.  The directions are on the WNAWD website, the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Otto and George come in.  A bunch of the freaks and regulars that you used to from this radio show will be there.  We've got the ultimate WOW wet t-shirt contest going down, Anthony, with cash prizes.  Cash.  So, ladies, you'll be able to sign up on the spot to show off your wares for some serious cash, okay? 
[01:10:00]  Ant and I will be working the line and allowing a lot of the ladies to come in.  Yeah.  We're kind of sick of seeing penises.  Oh, that's all there is.  I mean, I'm okay.  We loved you guys and all, but, man.  Penises.  Here they come walking through the door.  Penises.  Penises.  Penises.  We're going to be looking for vaginas.  Yeah.  So, guys, if you get there late and you're like, oh, man, there's a line. 
[01:10:30]  I want to get in.  Bring a hot girl.  You may have a chance.  Yeah.  Because we're going to start working the line and getting some of the girls in there to even out the odds there, right?  That's your ticket.  Why is guys yelling out there?  He's been freaked out since the beginning of the show when he cut that Fat Boy Slim song short.  I don't know what that reason it is.  All right, so we've got the wow wet t-shirt contest.  We've got the spaz dunk tank.  Speaking of spaz, this, I think, is going to be the most popular item this Thursday. 
[01:11:00]  The spaz dunk tank.  If you hate spaz, you come down.  If he's hung up on you or yelled like he is now to you on the phone, you come down, and I guess you throw the softballs at the target.  And dunk him in the tank.  What's that, Rick?  We're going to have the target actually be spaz's face.  Oh, a little picture of his face?  Yes.  And he's going to be in the Boy Scout uniform, right?  Right.  Good.  Very good.  Can we throw a toaster in the water?  That would be interesting. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, stuff.  All right, so we're bringing the kiddie pool, too, so some girls could have some fun with that.  Yeah, we might even have a little person in the pool with some shit.  Oh, our little midget friend, man.  Nice.  Scott the midget.  He's a lot of fun.  And they'll have super soakers if you make fun of them.  And also, Ant, we're doing a sign contest.  There's a lot of you freaks bringing down some really funny signs.  Yeah.  And just tons of things.  We're getting the whole thing together as we speak.  Your brother's coming down to sing some of the most offensive songs live. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, of course.  At South Beach Water Club.  You remember.  And we're looking for the other guys that had their most offensive songs on the radio.  We want some of you guys to perform them live.  Where's Fuel?  Where's Fuel?  Where's Q?  He hasn't called us yet.  Q called.  Q called?  He looks like it's going to be a good thing for him.  All right.  He's going to come down and do probably two of the songs.  What songs did he do again?  He did...  I'm Horny for Little Girls.  I'm Horny for Little Girls.  Yeah.  And the Imagine.  Imagine.  That's right.  I was talking to someone about that Imagine song this weekend.  They said that by far was the best one. 
[01:12:30]  And I think if we can get Scott to dress up as a chick.  Little Scott.  All he sings the song.  And we need Fuel to call.  Yeah.  Fuel.  Or email or something.  Yeah.  In touch with us.  Yeah.  I mean, he was one of the most popular guys in the contest.  He came up with Baby Raper.  What was the other one?  Camp Concentration.  Camp Concentration.  He had like three in the contest that we played a lot.  Yeah.  So we'll have that going on.  We're going to do the Ugly Ass Competition.  So if you've got one of those big old ugly asses. 
[01:13:00]  Ugly ass.  We want to get you on stage as well.  Mm-hmm.  And just lots and lots of things going on.  It's going to be a lot of fun this Thursday.  Oh, yeah.  Rain or shine.  Will you guys have the We Deliver Keggers girl?  We had her at Mulcahy's.  Yeah.  She's done.  Right?  They put her in a dunk tank, too.  Oh, no.  She wouldn't do it.  Just leave her outside.  She doesn't do anything.  She just comes in and is a lunatic.  So I hope you guys are going to join us this coming Thursday, starting at 3. 
[01:13:30]  Doors open at 2.  Get there early.  21 or older.  Yeah.  South Beach Water Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park on Long Island.  And that's all you need to know right now.  Yeah.  We guarantee you'll have a good time.  Get there early, though, really.  People want to know if they have to pay to dunk spas.  No.  No.  No.  It's just one of those things.  You've just got to stand online.  I'm sure it'll be a long one.  We're trying to, like, make a little, like, Lollapalooza thing where there'll be little things  going on, little areas all over the place kind of thing. 
[01:14:00]  That's what we're trying.  We've got some other things planned.  We can't talk about yet because they're not confirmed.  But we're trying.  Is there room for me?  Foot wants to know.  Your old buddy.  Who's Foot?  Hey, Foot.  Foot.  Oh, man.  That ain't my foot.  That's not my pal Foot.  Let me get in with these nuts, nigga.  Oh.  He's trying, like, some gag from another show or something.  Is that the guy from earlier, too?  It's not.  Dude, call the show where that's relevant. 
[01:14:30]  I don't get it.  Is he going to, like, call his friends and say you got on the radio now?  No one gets it here.  Is it some catchphrase for some other show or something?  For some other radio show, maybe?  Renee, what's going on?  All right.  Yeah, what's up, Renee?  I'm moving to California in three days.  Yes.  And I want to come down tomorrow.  Ah, that's pretty handy.  You can make some money and you can leave the area.  I need to go to California with.  Well, here's the deal.  Tomorrow we are playing Winstock Broker Dave's Money. 
[01:15:00]  Last time we did this, he gave out $400 to one girl to do something crazy.  Winstock Broker Dave's Money.  Dickening, whiffle ball things.  You'll win my money by doing perverse, sensual things.  I'm really upset that I'm not going to get to listen to you guys anymore.  Uh, syndication underground.  You got a computer?  Yeah, but I don't know how to get to where you're syndicated at.  Email.  Email.  You just got to be really smart about it.  You'll figure it out.  Okay.  All right.  And I'm going to miss the road show. 
[01:15:30]  Ah.  Well, come down tomorrow and try to win some of Stock Broker Dave's Money.  Yeah, and I want to meet you guys before I leave.  Just show up, right?  We don't have to tell, you know, we don't have to put you on hold.  Just show up 57th and 7th anytime tomorrow.  Okay.  All right?  Thank you.  All right, Renee.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Okay, bye.  Yeah, Winstock Broker Dave's Money is tomorrow.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  We get like 10 or 12 normal girls.  We line them up, and then Dave just puts money down on the table and suggests crazy things to do.  And one of the ladies will step forward and do it for the cold, hard cash, Anthony. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  And the chance to be a star.  There'll be people suggesting things for the road show.  Fill the spaz dunk tank with rooftop urine.  Greg on line one wants to know, will there be a cover?  No, there will not be a cover.  No cover until 7.  No cover until 7.  There early.  Get there early.  No cover.  We're trying to keep the beer prices down.  We all know we got screwed at a past road show and all that, but we've worked that out this time around, okay? 
[01:16:30]  You live and learn, Opie.  Yes, we have lived and learned.  Yeah.  Fuel is on line five, Anthony.  Cool.  Fuel!  Afternoon.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Well, we're patiently waiting for you to call and to see if you're going to be at the road show Thursday, Fuel.  I'm absolutely sure.  You'll be there?  Yeah.  And you're more than willing to sing Baby Raper live?  I'll sing whenever you want.  You got an acoustic guitar or something?  I got a couple of them.  Yes.  Yeah, this guy's been around. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  You want to come down and hear Baby Raper live?  Yeah, this is going to be like meeting a rock star when this guy walks in.  Oh, it's going to be crazy.  Come on.  You know, I thought it had died down when I was at a bar the other night, and people left  and right coming up, they're like, my cousin told me you're that guy.  You're that guy.  And my wife just puts her head down like, oh, I thought this was over.  Fuel, between you and Q, you guys are going to be the stars of this road show this coming  Thursday.  I'm all for it.  You're going to feel like Peter Frampton on Frampton Comes Alive when you get in front 
[01:17:30]  of that crowd singing Baby Raper.  Can you sing Camp Concentration live?  I'll sing whatever you want.  I don't care.  You're going to have to sing both.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't wait.  This is great.  Live performance.  By Fuel and Q.  So that way, when people requested that, you could go, hey, you want the album version  or the live track?  Wait, let's figure this out.  So far at the road show, we're going to have Fuel singing Baby Raper and Camp Concentration  live.  Q is going to sing I'm Horny for Little Girls and Imagine, remember, Imagine. 
[01:18:00]  And your brother's going to be singing Old Mind Fury live, Anthony.  All Mind Fury and the, which one?  Just Bought My Daughter.  That was it.  So we got six of the most offensive songs going to be performed live this Thursday at  the road show.  Right there is Worth coming down.  Oh, my God.  What other songs?  I'm trying to remember the other songs.  With any luck, hopefully Stephen Lynch doing Full Blown Aids.  Full Blown Aids?  Could be.  He doesn't have the balls.  Is Dina Kola coming down?  I believe Mike is going to be coming down. 
[01:18:30]  If Dina Kola comes down, I know he'll perform it with Stephen playing the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So most likely you'll hear FBA as well.  Yeah.  Well, Fuel.  The song that started it all.  Yeah.  We'll see you Thursday.  We're very excited.  Cool.  Me too.  I'm going to feel like I'm meeting a rock star when I finally meet you live.  I know.  Fuel.  I'm going to be looking at Ant going, dude, there he is.  That's Fuel, man.  Baby Raper.  Come on.  Baby Raper, man.  He doesn't look insane.  Well, we don't either, so we've got something in common. 
[01:19:00]  I'm looking forward to it.  All right, Fuel.  We'll see you Thursday.  Okay, cool.  Hey, I don't even want to know your real name.  You're Fuel.  You're Fuel, man.  That's all I need to know.  When he breaks out with Baby Raper, the crowd is going to go wild.  Yeah.  You know it.  Yeah, dude.  You're going to be the...  I think you are going to be the head of the whole damn thing.  Do you ever play in front of a couple of thousand people?  Actually, 700 is the most people I've ever played in front of.  700?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait until you hear a couple of thousand people chanting, Fuel, Fuel, Fuel, Fuel.  I wasn't playing Baby Raper either, so...  Oh, wow.  This is your hit.  You know what's great about this song, too?  You're going to be able to just stick the mic into the crowd and let them sing a verse. 
[01:19:30]  Let them sing a...  Baby Raper.  Oh, my...  And then you kick back in.  Baby Raper.  Right.  It's going to be like Freebird.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Oh, it's going to be rock.  It's going to rock.  The lighter's going to be out for you.  Lighter.  Oh, that's great.  All right, Fuel.  Cool.  We'll see you Thursday.  All right, thanks, guys.  This is starting to shape up to be...  Oh, yeah.  ...a fine party.  An event.  An event.  Another one-a event.  Another way to kick off the summer.  We've got brand-new Wow t-shirts we're giving out, too. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Plenty of stickers, too.  All right, so this is good.  Yeah.  Has Jim Brewer committed to the road show yet?  No, not yet.  No?  Still waiting for the call.  We're still waiting.  We're hoping.  Hmm.  We'll see what happens, but make plans for this Thursday, okay?  Starts at 3.  Doors open at 2.  Get there early.  I'm telling you, if you really want to go.  So, 21 or older, South Beach Water Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park, on Long Island.  We've got the directions on the WNAW website and the unofficial Opie and Anthony website. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  Rock.  And we've got to take a quick break, and when we come back, we've got to talk about Staten Island.  A lot of controversy over our Wow stickers.  We'll get into that next.  And speaking of Wow stickers really fast, Psycho Mark, has Psycho Mark left?  He's leaving in like 15 minutes.  When are you leaving, right now?  I'm leaving right now.  Okay, Psycho Mark is leaving the building right now.  You know what?  No, no.  Because people are going to say, why aren't you yelling at Psycho Mark for not leaving yet?  Because he works.  He has a real job.  Yeah, because he actually has stuff to do. 
[01:21:00]  Like, it's not just filling out, opening up envelopes and shoving Wow stickers in there.  He does all the production.  He just came in here with 20 brand new commercials that he had to put together today.  How did my new tag come out for Strauss?  Did you get the outtakes?  No, because there really wasn't.  Dude, I am becoming a pro.  Damn it.  No, no, you're not.  Oh, shut up.  You're getting very good.  So, how did you find out about Stacker 2?  Shut up.  Hey, sweetie! 
[01:21:30]  All right, Psycho Mark's leaving in, like, minutes.  He's going to be at the Ranch 1 on Beaver Street, Anthony.  Yes.  That's 24 Beaver Street, downtown Manhattan.  You said street.  Between Broad and Whitehall?  Between Broad and Whitehall, 24 Beaver Street.  Broad's Beaver?  What?  Ranch 1.  Go down there.  Mark will be there very soon with the brand new Wow stickers, okay?  Yeah.  All right, we'll be back. 
[01:22:00]  Some days, you know, we're a last ride.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  Anthony with EW.  Psycho Mark has left the building, Anthony.  Yes.  He's heading to Ranch 1 on Beaver Street between Broad and Whitehall.  Downtown Manhattan at Ranch 1 to get out the brand new Wow stickers.  If you're in the area, stop by.  Psycho Mark will hand them to you, okay?  Yeah.  Off the instant feedback, Linda from New York. 
[01:22:30]  At the construction site on 50th and 7th Ave, some very loyal construction working fans have sprayed a huge Wow  and an O&A on the girders of a building that will be just girders for a while.  I'll send a pic with the street sign for the website soon.  Nice.  Very good.  Thank you.  Well, Wow is definitely picking up steam, Anthony.  Yeah, you can tell that it's getting a little popular when we start getting negative publicity.  Yeah, we'll get a lot of these before the Wow campaign is over this year, but I see you guys have been getting your Wow stickers. 
[01:23:00]  I saw them all over the LIE and the Northern State and all the highways on Long Island this weekend.  Thank you for the support out there, guys.  Every weekend you just see more and more.  Are you seeing a lot in the Brooklyn area?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Hell yeah.  A lot of people with their work, trucks and stuff.  And cars.  Well, we made the Staten Island Advance, I think it's called.  Local paper, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  Headline reads, Outer Bridge Toll Collectors Ordered to Remove Stickers, Anthony. 
[01:23:30]  Ordered.  Motorists complain about slogan promoted by Radio Talk Show.  What's slogan?  This article's written by Heidi, so you can just imagine where this is going to go real fast.  Who would have thought that a simple toll booth at the Outer Bridge Crossing could be such a hotbed of gender politics?  Ah.  It all started with a silly slogan called Wow.  Silly.  To fans of the Opie and Anthony radio show, any WFM, that's short for Whip Them Out Wednesdays. 
[01:24:00]  The it in question is breasts.  And the idea is, well, you get it.  First of all, it's Whip Them Out Wednesdays.  Yeah, where's the it?  There is no it in Whip Them Out Wednesdays, Heidi.  See, right.  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  And the it in question, no, it's the um in question.  See, you know, we don't want to call it Whip It Out Wednesday.  That would be a homo thing to do.  Yeah.  Heidi.  Whip, Whip Um Out. 
[01:24:30]  Whip Um Out Wednesday.  Heidi Singer, Advance Staff Writer, Opie.  I'm with the Advance, you know.  Daily News.  Right.  Advance.  Daily Planet.  Advance.  Whatever.  Ever since these talk show geniuses.  Hey, thank you.  I love when they call us geniuses.  You call us whatever you want.  We don't give a crap.  I am a genius.  Ever since these talk show geniuses got the idea to encourage women to expose their breasts  once a week, bumper stickers and homemade signs have been popping up among fans of the 
[01:25:00]  Manhattan station to remind the ladies not to be shy.  Yes.  At least one of these stickers found its way onto the wall of a toll booth on the outer  bridge crossing about two weeks ago, sparking controversy in the chat pages of the Staten  Island Live website.  What?  Sparking controversy.  Controversy in the chat pages of the Staten Island Live website.  Ooh, that must be some website.  How many hits do they get a day?  Five? 
[01:25:30]  Jesus.  Well, we got a new enemy of the show, the chat pages of the Staten Island Live website.  I don't even know how to get there.  I'm sure I'm listening to this little podcast.  Oh, I'm sure they will.  Oh, no.  It's just so ugly.  I was humiliated to see WOW stickers on a toll booth yesterday, and it's a poor representation  of the Port Authority's part, wrote an anonymous participant on Thursday in this chat room. 
[01:26:00]  Listen up.  No one is forcing you to do it to get through the toll, complained another reader.  There are so many other problems on Staten Island, and you concern yourself with a sticker  on a toll booth?  Yes.  Women can rest assured that the offending sticker has been removed from public property, said  Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  A supervisor took immediate action after receiving complaints from the public, said Coleman, adding  that a stern warning will be issued to all Port Authority toll booth operators that WOW stickers 
[01:26:30]  will not be tolerated.  Yesterday, several toll operators looked cheapish when questioned about the stickers, and none  would admit they were fans of the opiator show.  Yeah.  That's always a good thing.  What?  No.  Opiator?  What?  Who?  Oh, what?  Hitler, Goebbels, what?  Never heard of them.  They're so evil.  And then one toll collector said, they flash us anyway, joked one worker when asked why there  was no WOW sticker on his window. 
[01:27:00]  So first of all, ladies, take care of the guys over there in Staten Island.  Yeah, the toll booths.  Because they can't display their WOW stickers.  Wow stickers, even without the WOW sticker.  And I would suggest that a lot of WOW stickers pop up around that Outer Bridge Crossing, Anthony.  Yeah.  I do believe we need a few WOW stickers in that area.  Yeah.  If you get your hands on a bunch of WOW stickers, definitely plaster that area.  Please.  The website, silive.com?  Yeah.  Can't load it up now.  Oh, really?  I think everybody found it.  Hee-hee. 
[01:27:30]  It's silive.com.  Silive.com.  So there you go, our first negative article of the season, Anthony.  Yeah.  Boy, wait until you see how many of these pop up.  Many to follow.  Oh, yeah.  There's no getting on this.  Really?  All right.  Didn't even have to declare them enemy of the show.  They just take it upon themselves.  Although it sounded like there were some people sticking up for us.  Anthony, what's going on?  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Good.  This island is horrible, man. 
[01:28:00]  These people complain about everything.  Yeah.  And, I mean, they got homosexuals cruising the parks and everything.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Very funny.  What?  What was that?  What the hell was that?  Is there, like, a full moon today?  We're getting some weird people.  All right.  Let's go to Brian.  I guess she's not a fan of WOW.  I don't know what that was about.  Brian, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Great.  I'm a resident of Staten Island, unfortunately, and I've been on that Staten Island chat room 
[01:28:30]  a couple times.  A bunch of anal-retentive nitwits.  I mean, oh, my God.  But the first caller right before me was right.  These people here have nothing better to do, so they pick on stickers on the wall.  But I'd just like to see you guys.  Great.  Well, we need a lot of WOW stickers in the area of question here.  Well, yeah.  I mean, Staten Island is culturally deficient anyway, but any culture we get will help, and  WOW stickers would certainly fit that bill. 
[01:29:00]  But, Jesus, you've got to see some of these people out there.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  They're already in it.  I'm in the chat room.  And what do they say?  From this ONA fan.  SILive.com, right?  Balloon Night.  One of the names.  ONA fan.  And what do they say, man?  All right.  Hey, all.  There we go.  I'm the guy that's just five X's on the side.  Hot Lunch says, okay, terrific. 
[01:29:30]  It's not even a forum.  It's a chat room.  All right.  Let's just take over the chat room.  Opie and Anthony say, wow.  Now it's just getting down.  Dice Clay.  What kind of smell is that in Staten Island?  Mariah Carey?  George Steinbrenner says, Timmy.  Holy crap.  Hello, Frankie.  Saying hi to me there.  All right.  Let's go to Mike real fast.  Mike, what's up?  Wells, hi.  Yo, what's up, Mo?  Yang Bag. 
[01:30:00]  I work for the Advan.  You guys got to take it easy over there.  What?  Why?  No, what paper?  Staten Island Advan.  Advan.  What about it?  I try to work there.  I got to make a living.  So?  So, and anyway, if you can make a living, I'm on the Garden State Parkway.  I got a wow sticker sitting right next to me, about to go over the bridge.  Oh, you got a wow sticker?  I'm going to put the first one up.  Yeah, we encouraged to get a lot of wow stickers in the Outbridge Crossing.  I'm going to take care of that. 
[01:30:30]  All right, cool, man.  Thank you, Mike.  Okay.  It's just going fast.  I can't even get it.  What's going on?  What are they saying?  Anything funny?  I'm putting it, I'm over here now.  There we go.  Rob says, vagina.  Yambag says, look what I did to you again.  Dude, it's scrolling as fast as you can scroll a screen.  It's just, I see it.  Dr. Smith says, butt sex.  You guys are a bit, look how fast it's going. 
[01:31:00]  I see the reflection behind you.  It's just like spinning now.  You can't even read it.  It's going so fast.  Do they have a message board or something we could just attack?  I'm sure they do.  Yeah?  Look at all the nays in here.  Al Sharpton, baby rapers in here, balloon knot, banana juice, camel toe, chocolate starfish,  corkies in here.  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:31:30]  That's funny.  Look, it's just, I can't even read it now.  You can't even get it.  It's going so fast.  Yeah.  The administrator's getting pissed.  They're kicking people off, but they're signing off faster than they can kick off.  Garbage, you said.  Oh, and they rule.  Wow.  Dude, it is going so fast, and the administrator's trying so hard to kick everyone off.  But they're signing on twice as fast. 
[01:32:00]  That is funny.  Good work.  Good work, man.  Remember the days we would get trashed and we wouldn't fight back, Anthony?  I know.  We had this nice little army, and we could fight back.  It's kind of nice.  Yambag just got kicked off.  Good work, Yambag.  Oh, my God.  Yambag just got hit.  It's like a war.  But more people are signing on than they could kick off.  It's silive.com.  Silive.com.  It's in the forum chat section.  Yeah.  And it's the town square room. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  There are 132 users in here right now, and all of them are, oh, Anthony Listman's just pounding it.  I've never seen a chat room go this fast in my life.  Oh, Corky Steinbrenner just bought the farm.  Corky just got hit.  Quick.  Put in Kowalski.  Kowalski, get in to take him over.  Wow, look how fast it's going.  Now we're just skipping a page at a time.  I want to see if Kowalski jumps in.  Kowalski, get in there. 
[01:33:00]  Get in there.  Pimp hands in.  Pimp hands in.  The administrator cannot kick off people faster than they're signing on.  Well, you want it to be an enemy of the show.  Here you go.  Midget sex.  The Staten Island Advance just doesn't like wow, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I can't read it.  Outerbridge toll collectors ordered to remove stickers.  I'm over here now.  Just bought it.  I'm over here now.  Good work. 
[01:33:30]  You'll be remembered.  I can't even tell who that one thing got kicked off.  It went by so fast.  They're pitching and complaining about one lousy wow sticker, Anthony.  Now, because they're the enemy of the show,  there's going to be hundreds of wow stickers around the Outerbridge Crossing area.  Oh, my lawn just got kicked off.  Oh, my lawn.  Brody, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Working at the Advance, man.  Yeah?  You work there?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, they got nothing better to do than right things like that, man.  I'm telling you. 
[01:34:00]  It's the worst paper in the world, man.  All right, buddy.  Mike Tyson just kind of hit.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  This thing, you shouldn't be promoting this, man.  This could be illegal.  You could get in trouble for this.  Why is it illegal?  Our listeners...  This could be considered a denial of service attack, man.  No.  No, stop.  Our listeners have some opinions about, you know, the wow thing. 
[01:34:30]  They're commenting in a chat room, in an open forum.  That's right.  And if...  Yeah, you know, some people might look at it different, though.  Yeah?  You got a whole bunch of people hitting that site.  Well, you know, if they do something bad, they get kicked off the site.  Unfortunately, since they've started kicking people off, when there was 131 users, there's  now 145 users.  It is pretty freaking hilarious, though.  It is going so fast, you can't even read.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, guys.  You just don't want to be an enemy of this show. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, there's a picture showing up.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Something sent to the beard.  Very funny, people.  They're just going nuts.  Camel toe is on there.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Actually, this is Eric.  Was that spaz answering the phone?  Yeah, probably.  He's such a tool.  Actually, I want you guys to send me a stack.  If you guys could send me a stack of wow stickers, I'll tattoo every light post coming 
[01:35:30]  off the toll plaza.  That's a great idea.  We want a ton of wow stickers in the Outer Bridge Crossing area of Staten Island.  Got to send them out.  I don't have the address, though.  You can get the stickers, though.  If you send a stack, I'll hit every light post coming off the toll plaza.  All right.  Hold on to the line, Scott.  Someone take care of Scott on line, too.  What's going on, Ed?  Well, Baby Raper's doing a great job.  I just saw I got it from a Negro.  The Fama just got kicked off, too. 
[01:36:00]  Good job, people.  How many people are in that chat room right now?  Holding at 140.  140?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Midget socks.  Okay, terrific.  Doing a great job.  Anthony?  Zachary Smith is not.  Anthony Joe from Connecticut?  Yeah.  Your listeners on that website are like the flag bearers of the Civil War.  As soon as one gets it, another picks up the flag to carry on the battle.  See?  Celine's Gash just bought it. 
[01:36:30]  But Cleveland Steamer stepped right in to take over.  Hey, look.  Ben Stein's in there.  You people are a pisser, man.  That's funny.  Good job.  We're laughing.  I've never seen a chat room rotate this fast.  Man.  All right.  Good job.  Hit 140. 
[01:37:00]  I can't take it.  Thumbs up.  This guy, if I'm putting pictures on now, like of bombs falling off and beach balls.  It's just like, you guys are great.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  Yeah.  I got two things for you, LNA.  Yeah.  Number one, for a couple weeks, I forget the name of it.  Somebody created an AOL chat room that was completely dedicated to WoW.  Nice.  And I'll tell you right now, AOL's texts have never been dedicated. 
[01:37:30]  There's like 150 of them on one chat room monitoring what's decent and what's not.  And the other thing is, I was driving home a little while ago, and there was a truck,  and it said WoW trucking lines on one, and then it had WoW all over the side,  but under WoW trucking lines, it said dedicated to ONA.  Ah, cool.  Very cool.  Thank you, Matt.  We're a little distracted because it's really funny.  This chat room is just destroyed.  I'll tell you what, guys. 
[01:38:00]  You've got to get more people.  You've got to get more people out there.  Because I'll tell you what.  I'll personally, I live in Union County.  I'll personally go over to Staten Island Bridges, put WoW stickers all over all the Staten Island Bridges  and every one of the GSP toll booths.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  All right.  Adios.  Welcome to 155 users who are now just sent bombarding it with pictures.  And it's sick.  Hey, Anthony, Greg from Staten Island checking in. 
[01:38:30]  Um, the SI Advance office is located at 950 Fingerboard Road, Staten Island.  Oh, yeah?  Just wanted to announce that.  Now people just can't get on, Anthony.  Yeah.  More traffic on the silive.com site than the outer bridge itself.  Oh, Dr. Smith just bought it.  He was doing a great job for us.  He just bought the farm.  You bought it, huh? 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  Staten Island Advance email address, Anthony.  Yes.  Cowhig.  C-O-W-H-I-G.  Cowhig.  At S-I-A-S-I Advance dot com.  All right.  S-I Advance dot com.  Oh.  Gay Marco just lost it.  Just bought it?  Gay Marco just lost it.  That's the lead camel toe.  Scout, what's going on?  That's the lead camel toe.  Let's back up.  Hey, Scott.  Hello.  Hey. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, congratulations.  You know, tomorrow you made the front page.  Staten Island Advance.  I can picture it now.  O-N-A.  Pharma.  Pharma.  Yeah.  How many people check out that newspaper, though?  Oh.  It's pretty popular.  It's a crappy paper.  Crappy paper.  Yeah.  Okay, Scott.  Listen, I work in Jersey.  I go over to Gothel's Bridge every day.  And every day, the toll collector that I go to is listening to you guys.  So now I'm just going to hand out stacks and stacks of stickers to the guy.  Got to do it.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:40:00]  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, it would have been, you know, maybe occasionally she would have seen a WOW sticker that upset  her so much.  She might have occasionally seen one at the toll booths.  Mm-hmm.  Now she is going to see them all the time.  She's going to see them all over the place.  That's it.  We won WOW stickers all over the Outer Bridge Crossing.  We love a battle.  We love when we can focus a battle.  Like, the whole WOW campaign is just tri-state wide.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, so we, uh, uh, have our resources, our army, and we spread it all over the area. 
[01:40:30]  But when we can focus on, uh, one location for a set time because we're at war, oh, God,  we love it.  Concentrated bombing.  Uh, it's like the ball-bearing plants in Germany.  We supply our planes over there and just, bomb the ball-bearing factory.  You know?  Instead of just, you know, carpet bombing Berlin.  And it's like, we've got to get the ball-bearing plant right here. 
[01:41:00]  Uh, Anthony, the, the Staten Island Advance, which is located at 950 Fingerboard Road?  Yes.  I don't know why that's important, but, uh, okay, it's in the, uh, in this instant feedback?  Yeah.  Well, um, the office already has two WOW stickers outside the office.  Wow!  All right.  Well, good luck to them.  Yeah, good luck to them.  If they post, uh, WOW stickers out there, I guess they want to be WOWed.  Uh, Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Baddy-booddy-booddy-boop.  Baddy-booddy-booddy-boop.  Bow-bop.  Bow-bop. 
[01:41:30]  One of the troops.  Thank you, Rich.  Listen, guys, I got a way you can log on to the, uh, site with administrative rights.  You won't get booted off.  And how's that?  It's legal.  Perfectly legal.  All right, guys, and I'm not going to say where I work.  Nothing like that, all right?  It's the website address name.  And then at the end, you're going to need to forward slash admin-net.htm.  You should be all right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right?  Thank you.  Baddy-booddy-booddy-bip, brothers.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Dee.  Dee, what's going on? 
[01:42:00]  Hi.  Hi, Dee.  How are you?  Good.  I love you guys.  Oh, thank you.  You make me laugh so hard.  Cool.  I need some WOW safety advice.  Safety.  I've WOWed twice and twice.  If someone has run off the road, another person hits the back bumper of another car.  You must have a nice set of boobs there, Dee.  I have a beautiful set of boobs.  Yeah.  But I don't want to shy away from not WOWing anymore because I don't want to hurt anybody.  Well, you've got to just make sure the opportunity is right. 
[01:42:30]  Okay, well.  Make sure the situation is right.  Make sure they're kind of stuck in traffic, going a little slow.  That's exactly what I did.  Make sure you pick someone that can handle the WOWing.  Yeah, maybe not a truck driver because, I mean, he basically almost followed me to my house.  And I know that maybe I took it a little far because I was funneling myself a little bit.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at you.  Yeah.  That's great.  It was a really beautiful, warm day.  Vaginas.  A nice opportunity.  But the guy freaked out.  But, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  You're going to tell your guys out there to expect the WOW and not to freak out if we do it.  Yeah.  Well, our listeners know they're not supposed to harass the ladies.  They put the WOW on their car, whether it's the brand new WOW sticker or, you know, a homemade WOW sign.  And they just go about their business.  If they get lucky enough to get WOWed, that should be it.  Okay?  Okay.  And most of our listeners play by those rules, without a doubt.  All right.  Well, I'll keep up the good work.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Are you seeing more WOW stickers out there? 
[01:43:30]  I actually am.  I drive a lot on 95, and I see more and more.  And how many times have you WOWed so far?  Only those two times, and I just got scared because, you know, I don't want to cause accidents.  And I have, you know, double-D breasts.  And, you know, they're very perky and beautiful, and I'm very proud of them.  But I don't want to freak anybody out.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  But, you know, as long as it's safe, I'll keep doing it.  Yeah, definitely.  Just make sure the situation's okay.  We don't want anyone getting hurt.  Oh, you're very naughty.  All right, D.  Thank you.  Okay, thanks. 
[01:44:00]  Bye.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah, Dr. Smith, look out for D on I-95 this coming Wednesday.  Mmm.  Double-D.  Double-D.  It's double-D.  What's going on with that website, Ant?  Oh, you're, you're, uh, now it's, oh, my God, it's still just flying now.  160 users, just full force, pounding.  Spaz-a-rific.  Like everybody on this.  Well, we want to thank the Staten Island Advance for writing about Whip-A-Mow Wednesday. 
[01:44:30]  Nigger Charlie.  Nigger Charlie checking in.  Timmy.  The Invisible Man.  I can't read them.  They're going so fast.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, good job.  Guys, you know what to do.  And someone has to give a full report.  We want WOW stickers all over the Outer Bridge Crossing.  171 users.  And now it's going so fast, I can't even read for a second.  It's just flying.  175.  Come on, 180.  When it gets to 180, sell.  I think probably the guy in charge of the chat room had a heart attack. 
[01:45:00]  He can't take it.  He's lost.  180.  There it is.  180.  181.  Come on, 200.  I want to see this go to 200 users.  The guy has completely given up.  Completely given up.  187.  188.  Come on.  Go for two.  It is flying.  That's funny.  190.  Yep.  191.  Come on.  There we go.  200. 
[01:45:30]  Come on.  Come on, people.  199.  Oh.  Oh, we're right there.  Come on.  Back to 196.  Come on, 200.  Show them the power.  It's 100.  There it is.  200.  It's flying.  210.  215.  Look how fast it's going.  That's hilarious.  Oh, you people are great. 
[01:46:00]  220.  Pete from Jersey.  War is great.  Bombs away.  We love a good battle.  All right, now.  We've got to take a break.  We're running late here.  You guys don't let up.  Keep it going, okay?  We'll be back.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Funny doodle.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie has Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler. 
[01:46:30]  We're off to a flying star here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, Anthony.  We need an update from the front.  Yes.  We're in the middle of a mini war here.  A little battle flared up this afternoon on the ONA show.  We have the Staten Island Advance.  They wrote a negative article on Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I guess there was a wow sticker on one of the toll booths on the outer bridge crossing.  A lady pissed and complained. 
[01:47:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  They wrote an article, and I guess it all started in this stupid SILive.com chat room or something like that?  Yeah, I guess they were having a little chat about the wow thing, and some people were a little upset about it.  Well, we went to the SILive.com forum and went into the town hall chat, and a couple of our listeners joined us in the chat room.  We were having a lot of fun with it right up until it just froze up and crashed when it reached 220 people in the room. 
[01:47:30]  220 soldiers, Anthony.  Soldiers.  Yes.  It just froze up.  Uh, I've been trying to log back on.  I just got back on.  Okay.  All through that break.  And, uh, oh, boy, they're at it again.  All right, the chat room's working again?  Uh, 195 people in there.  99.  200.  Let's see what happens when it goes to 220 again.  220, baby. 
[01:48:00]  Looking for 220.  All right, 201.  They're pounding it.  Uh-huh.  I want to see if it happens again, because all I know is the whole thing froze right up.  It didn't move again.  Well, Anthony Asswipe, from, uh, Blackest Hell, writes,  Us ONA listeners are like the Chinese Army.  We're not the smartest, but God damn it, there's a lot of us ready to die for the cause.  Yeah.  I guess we got the lady that started the whole complaint in this stupid chat room on the line. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  And she listens.  She listens to the show, obviously.  Yeah, what do we...  Let's, uh, go to S.I. Queen.  S.I. Queen.  Yes.  What's going on?  I'm sorry, guys.  What happened?  I, um, you know, I love your show and everything, but those toll booth collectors, I don't think  they should have them up.  And I did call, and I wrote, I started it on the forum.  Well, why shouldn't the toll booth collectors have a wow sticker on their booth?  It doesn't, it doesn't say you have to wow to get through the toll booth.  They are...  It's just a suggestion. 
[01:49:00]  It's easy as it is.  They're, they're supporting, uh, the wow cause, and you don't have to do anything if you don't  want to.  Right.  Before wow started, they were trying to look down everybody's shirt.  Now they've got a sign saying, just show me, because my neck hurts.  They're men.  I'm sorry.  They're, no, not the toll booth guys, please.  We've got to upgrade that a little bit.  We've got to upgrade it.  Wah, wah.  Well, that just froze up again, Opie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  217, uh, users, and, uh, it ain't moving.  Uh, you're out of your mind, SI Queen. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, what, what's the deal?  No.  No.  Why did you complain?  I complained because I was, it's like sexual harassment.  We have to give these guys money.  We've got to give them money and show them their booths.  I mean, come on.  We know you don't got to do anything.  You ever go through the, I know which bridge it was, the, it was the outer bridge.  You ever go through there?  Well, it sounds like you have a problem with the toll takers, uh, looking at you.  Yeah.  I do, because they do.  They lean back.  They try and look under your skirt.  They lean over, try and look into your shirt.  Under your skirt.  What are they, by the brake pedal?  You sound like you have a little bit of a problem. 
[01:50:00]  They lean all the way back.  What are you wearing?  What kind of top are you wearing?  If you're that upset about it, why don't you wear a turtleneck?  And they will still make you wait before they give you your change back, just so they can  get a good eye.  Look, I wait to get the change back.  It's just a part of going through a toll booth.  I think you're making a little more out of it.  Wait a minute.  But do they turn off their radio, sit on their chair, and lean back when they're giving you  the change?  I don't notice.  I'm not that crazy.  Right, because you're not a female, and that's why you're not offended by it.  Hey, Phil, what's up? 
[01:50:30]  Hey, how you doing?  How big is this chick's cans?  Yeah, how big are your cans?  Is she worth listening to?  How big are your cans?  How big are your boobs there?  Are they looking because you're sporting something there?  There's 36 double Ds.  Ah.  That's what it is.  Give me some.  What do you expect?  You're getting mad at a lion for charging at a piece of steak.  If she's got 36 double Ds, how big is she, though?  Is she about 500 pounds?  Oh, no.  Not at all.  No, 36 double Ds, the baby doesn't have back.  And I have been asked that without the WOW signs to do that. 
[01:51:00]  So that's why I'm offended, and every woman that goes through there should be.  And I'm sorry I started all this.  Blah, blah, blah.  I think WOW is great, but...  S.I. Queen, S.I. Queen, how many WOW stickers did you see at the Outer Bridge Crossing?  One?  I saw two on one and one on another.  Well, you're going to see hundreds now.  Yep.  Hundreds.  Hope you enjoy looking at them.  Right, we'll get a whole new fleet of toll booth collectors, and maybe they'll look good  enough worth to flash.  Oh, what, they don't look good enough for you?  No, I don't want to flash or something crazy like that. 
[01:51:30]  I wouldn't dare.  Something crazy like that.  But it was on the street or behind.  Maybe they're looking going, ew, look at her disgusting, flabby, big, droopy-ass pants.  That's why it takes us five minutes to go and give you the change, and then lean in over  and go through, and then come on the ground.  I look long and hard at some of the ugliest damn cans ever when I'm walking around.  Sweetie Pie, I'm sorry I won you over, but anyway...  S.I. Queen, S.I. Queen, S.I. Queen, S.I. Queen.  Why don't you get an easy pass?  I still love you anyway. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, get an easy pass.  Guys, I'm giving you the train.  Get an easy pass.  Get an easy pass.  Get a sleazy pass.  F-ing whore.  She gave us the train, Anthony.  Yeah, I saw that.  Wow.  Give everyone the train, and then we'll all reciprocate by training you.  200.  Give you the train.  Wow, now everyone is just...  They all have a comment about S.I. Queen.  210.  210 on the message board?  What a...  What a...  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[01:52:30]  To put a bumper sticker on a toll booth?  Please.  And remember, you don't have to do anything.  No.  Just because you see a wow sticker doesn't mean you have to wow.  She says, yeah, I have to give them money, and I have to flash my...  No.  Yeah, you have to give them money.  It's called a toll.  This isn't Russia.  But you don't have to flash.  You drive through.  I barely notice things when I'm going through the toll booth.  How many people are on there?  230.  230.  Oh, it's got to freeze up any second now. 
[01:53:00]  I'm outraged.  Unbelievable.  Uh, Anthony, Nan Hater just, uh...  Just entered the war.  All right.  As in Nana.  Nana Hater.  Nana Hater.  Just at 240.  240.  240.  Oh, let's go to Richie.  Richie, what's going on?  Sean Connery just got knocked off.  Hey, Richie.  Sean Connery.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you, Richie?  What's doing?  Yo, the ferry is loving this.  Let me tell you, the passengers are getting a kick out of this.  Oh, cool, man.  Yo, tell again, I care what anyone says. 
[01:53:30]  Staten Island is the biggest Opie and Anthony fans they are.  Hey, we love the people on Staten Island.  We were on Staten Island, what, two weeks ago, giving our wow stickers.  Big girl, Earl was out there, everything.  We all got them.  Everyone has them.  They are fantastic.  Who's the next black person you're going to invite over to Staten Island?  Al's our man.  Al's our man now.  All right, Richie.  Ring out any time.  Thank you.  Yo, guys, you got to hit Staten Island.  You two got to come over to Staten Island, to the ferry, and do something.  We would love to do something on Staten Island. 
[01:54:00]  I'm telling you, come out there.  The crowds are the best in Staten Island.  All right.  On the boat.  They're free.  60,000 people a day.  Come on.  Thank you, Richie.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  I've been to the wonderful mall over there at Staten Island.  You got that big mall over there, Opie.  I'd go there.  All right.  Oh, this guy, he's a toll booth worker.  He's going to admit that he looks at girls every chance he gets.  Sure.  Kowalski's on the boat.  Kowalski made it into the war.  Good.  Freddie, what's going on?  What's going on? 
[01:54:30]  You're a toll booth collector?  No, I used to be.  I used to be a temporary toll booth collector.  And I looked every single time I could.  Well, guys look every single time they can.  And they got the perfect vantage point.  Every time I saw some stuff in those cars, forget about it.  So what the hell are you supposed to do, you know?  That's it.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Freddie.  Take care.  All right.  Celine Dion checking in, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  SILive.com.  There will be no survivors. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  Well, we've got to move on to other things today.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, dear.  People want to know about the Roadshow.  Oh, yeah.  We could talk about that for a couple minutes here before we take a break.  And then we'll talk about the Knicks again and Rick Lazio.  Lazio.  There you go.  And the NRA and the NRA and the NRA.  Yes.  Theme restaurant.  I love it.  Yeah.  We'll get into all that in just a few minutes.  Yeah, Mew.  Need the guns. 
[01:55:30]  We'll talk about that next.  Real fast.  Our summer kickoff party is happening this Thursday.  It starts at 3.  We're doing the whole show live.  Doors open at 2.  21 or older.  At the South Beach Water Club, Anthony.  50 Broadway.  Island Park.  Yeah.  Fuel and Q just confirms.  Yeah.  These guys are like rock stars in our eyes.  They are, of course, the guys who came up with most of the most offensive songs that you know and love.  And they're going to be performing a lot of them live. 
[01:56:00]  I've got to tell you, at our Roadshow.  I am looking very forward to seeing Fuel perform Baby Raper live.  In front of about 15 to 800 of our listeners.  Festival crowd.  Yeah.  I would say closer to 2,000 people.  We're going for 2,000?  I would think so.  Now, when you put a Fuel on the bill like that.  Fuel on the bill.  All of a sudden.  Oh, forget it.  Otto and George.  Yeah.  Stephen Lynch.  Jeff Norris.  Jeff Norris.  A WOW wet t-shirt contest.  The end all wet t-shirt contest. 
[01:56:30]  The spaz dunking tank.  A best sign competition, Anthony.  Because a lot of people show up with the signs.  The ONA signs.  Yeah.  This is just going to be a party.  Fuel's going to be singing Baby Raper and Camp Concentration.  Yeah.  Q is going to be singing Imagine.  And I'm Horny for Little Girls.  Oh, horny.  Remember that one?  And my own brother, Joe.  Going to be showing up and doing his hits.  Oh, my fuhrer.  Oh, mine fuhrer.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  And I can never remember the name of that. 
[01:57:00]  I just boned my daughter.  Yeah.  Just boned my daughter.  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  How offensive.  And you can see it all live.  The live performances.  Rain or shine.  We're going to be at the South Beach Water Club this Thursday starting at 3.  But you're going to have to get there early.  I want to give early if you want to get in.  What?  I want to just make a statement to the musicians that will be showing up, much like they did  to all the people that showed up for the We Are The World thing.  Please, check the egos at the door, people.  This is a moment for us to all get together and perform live as one. 
[01:57:30]  Check the egos at the door, please.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  Just for the kids.  Yes.  South Beach Water Club this Thursday.  Doors open.  We Are The World.  21 or older.  50 Broadway.  Island Park on Long Island.  Directions on the WWD website and the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Louie Anderson checking in, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  I agree with SI Queen.  I hate when they check out my huge jugs in the boots. 
[01:58:00]  He'd agree with any queen.  Every time you see him now, and he knew this would happen.  And that's why, I remember that guy was going to say that he had asked, that Louie had  asked him for sex.  Yes.  And Louie had to pay him like $100,000 for him not to go to the press with it.  But the guy, it came out anyway.  Louie must have known this was going to happen because now any time I see Louie on TV, I'm  like, look at that big budget thing.  He had thought that before, but now it's just confirmed. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Because he was there, I am Louie Anderson, and you're watching Comedy Central.  And you're just like, okay, yeah, I'm watching Comedy Central, and you've got a big man meat  right there.  Nah, overbearing father.  Turned me into a man.  Dang.  All right.  Let's come back and talk about the NRA theme restaurant.  Yeah.  We'll talk about Rick Lazio.  Yeah.  What do you guys think of Rick Lazio?  I think he's cute. 
[01:59:00]  Offering money for sex.  No, that one doesn't make sense.  This Louie Anderson.  Oh, has he?  What, Adlet one?  Nah.  All right.  Oh, nah.  Nah, that one doesn't make sense.  That's okay, though.  All right.  Louie.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  O.P. and Anthony.  1-8-7-0-1-W-N-E-W.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Boy, not much chance to lose some weight before Thursday, huh? 
[01:59:30]  Our big event.  No, but...  Our live show.  It's going to be outdoors, right on the water.  I'm sure a lot of girls are going to be in bikinis.  Mm-hmm.  But now, if you didn't lose the weight that you packed on in the winter, what are you going  to do?  You're going to show up there in a parka.  But there's still time before the summer gets in full force here.  Anthony?  Snacker 2.  Our listeners come in all sizes, shapes, and shapes.  Wow. 
[02:00:00]  Look at you being all nice.  That's true.  But if you want to be a slender listener, Snacker 2.  Okay.  World's strongest fat burner.  Mm-hmm.  Also gives you that boost of energy you need.  You'll feel it's effects 45 minutes after taking it, guaranteed.  And then you won't have the urges to snack during the day.  So, it adds up to losing weight.  That's what you want to do.  Lose weight with Snacker 2.  1-800-LITELINE.  1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E, right?  Right, Opie.  For Snacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works. 
[02:00:30]  Give them a call.  1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine steak.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theodore of the Mindless.  1027.  W-N-E-W.  All right, lots going on on the program today.  Psycho Mark is at the Ranch 1 on Beaver Street between Broad and Whitehall, downtown Manhattan. 
[02:01:00]  He's giving out the brand-new Wow stickers, Anthony.  Yeah.  Stop by if you're in the area and say hi to Psycho Mark.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  We've got to say hi to Rambo.  Checking in from Fort Hamilton, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  He writes, looking forward to the USO show for the troops on Thursday.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  But it is.  And I guess the place we're doing the road show at is called the South Beach Dance Club.  What? 
[02:01:30]  South Beach Dance Club.  Dance Club?  I don't know if we'll be dancing Thursday.  No.  Well, there'll probably be some girls dancing.  We'll be rocking and partying.  I don't care what they call it.  They call it the O.B. and Anthony Road Show.  It's the Broadway, Island Park, Long Island, broadcasting live.  Our road shows are legendary at this point, Anthony.  And, yes, you can pull your boat up to be docked.  We're running out of places to do these road shows, so I would come down Thursday. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  We used to do them every month, and now it's like every three months because we're just running out of places that can hold our audience.  I'm excited at the lineup.  I mean, we're going to have a pisser, yes, as they say.  Yes.  A lot of the music you've been hearing here on the O.B. and Anthony Show, the song parodies performed by the artists that originally brought them to you.  Here, the likes of Fuel Q, my brother.  Very excited that Fuel called up and said he will be doing Baby Raper live this Thursday. 
[02:02:30]  Cowbell Bill just called, said he's going to put together a special mix of Dry, Dry, Dry V.  Oh, nice.  And without the vocals, so the whole crowd is going to get along, get to sing along with the Dry V song.  Very good.  That we can't play on the air anymore.  We'll have a kick-ass live version.  Let's not forget the WOW wet t-shirt contest, end all.  Yeah.  Wet t-shirt contest with cash prizes.  Wow.  Seems like all of New York is in a very good mood today, Anthony. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Knicks with a huge win yesterday.  Yeah, I'm not even, you know, me and basketball.  Well, let me tell you something.  I was a little, you know, excited.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  When Ann comes into work, Ann comes up to me and says, hey, Hope, did you see the end of the Knick game?  Then I know this Knick thing is getting out of hand.  Yeah, because I could give two crap.  Right.  But I got a little caught up in it.  And you guys abused me for about 40 minutes to start the show.  Yeah.  I didn't think the Knicks could pull it out.  I was wrong, obviously. 
[02:03:30]  Ewing, who I hate, came through last night.  And I came to play.  Had that game phases on.  And I came to play.  And I got the win.  And Jeff Van Gundy, once again, victorious over Pat Riley.  Yeah, we're going to talk two hours about his hair plugs.  The lack thereof.  And we got a great line from one of our listeners earlier.  It said, after the game, Jeff Van Gundy, he turned to the Miami Heat fans down there in Miami and yelled out,  look what we did to you again. 
[02:04:00]  Again.  And I'm excited, Ann, because I think I like this Rick Lazio.  Yeah, Lazio, I'm making a great impression there.  Is it Lazio or Lazio?  I don't know.  Lazio.  Lazio?  Lazio.  I don't know.  How does he say it?  He's going to get the women vote all moist.  Oh, my God.  Moist and tenderized.  The lady's just losing it already over his looks, Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  That's all they're talking about in the paper, his looks.  His handsome Lazio.  His Kennedy looks.  Yeah, a little different than Rudy.  How's his prostate?  Good?  Is he keeping it well lubed?  Well, his wife doesn't look too thrilled that he's in this race.  Yeah.  Well, you know, he sounded pretty good.  He came off confident.  Did a little Hillary bashing, calling her a carpetbagger and, you know, saying that he's 
[02:05:00]  worked here in New York.  He knows how the state works.  He was talking about his Long Island accent.  Yep.  Very good thing to do.  Makes you like a hometown guy.  I think we have a chance to keep Hillary out of this damn state.  Anything but Hillary.  Oh, please.  I'm a little happier about this.  So you think this guy is, like, going to have the Kennedy impact on the women?  Probably.  You know, where they look at him and kind of just vote with their loins?  Probably.  Vote with their vag. 
[02:05:30]  Vote with their vag.  Make a vote for your meat curtains.  Can they pull the lever with their vag?  God, that's horrible.  Let's go to Kevin.  Yo, ONA, what's going on?  How are you, Kevin?  Oh, listen, I'm not crazy about politicians, but this guy Lazio, we've got to get him in.  Yeah.  We can't get this witch running the state.  No.  You know what?  You guys should invite him to the road show on Thursday.  Oh, yeah.  That'll hook it right up. 
[02:06:00]  That'll make him a shoe in.  Oh, man, you've got to see this hot box who's, like, handling his press.  I went to the – I worked for a news organization.  I'm not going to say who, but I had to cover his announcement in West High Slope on Saturday.  From his high school.  From his high school.  Hometown boy.  From Babylon.  Hometown guy.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  What was he saying about the railroad?  He said he's still going to, you know, pay attention to the Babylon train station.  I guess he had some issues with that, you know.  But, yeah, you see, you know, he's a hometown guy.  Anyway, you were at the announcement. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, he's got this hot box handling press.  I mean, I'm just going to follow him around just to take a look at her, man.  But that aside, I mean, he's a real solid candidate.  And, like I said, I'm not crazy about politicians.  But this guy, I think, will do something.  And I think you guys, being from Long Island, should support him.  Without a doubt, I'm supporting him.  Don't know much about him.  We're endorsing him officially on this program?  I am.  Anything but Hillary.  Anything but Hillary.  The first.  You know?  Yes.  The first endorsement.  Nicky going to deliver keggers on Thursday. 
[02:07:00]  And I lean Democrat.  Lean.  Do you?  Yeah, but I do.  Anything but Hillary.  Screw Nicky and we deliver keggers.  Hey, a little out, a little out, Timmy.  All right, Kevin.  Peace out.  Bye.  Yeah, I'd rather have a moderate Republican than a Democrat any day.  Oh.  Democrats are so wacky.  Yeah.  Please.  We'll have to wait and see.  It should be a good campaign now.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Very excited about the possibilities. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  God, I just hate Hillary.  He went right on the, right to battle, though, against her.  Yeah.  Which is good.  And then she comes back.  Well, my latest candidate, my latest opponent, like there's a whole line of people.  No, it was Rudy and his prostate screwed up.  Right.  And his marriage.  And Lazio's been around a while.  He was the one that stepped aside so Rudy could run.  Yeah.  But she's like, you know, my latest candidate wants to talk about things like how long I've  been in the state. 
[02:08:00]  Why can't we get together and discuss the things that are important to the people of New York?  It would do that stupid politician talk.  It starts off slow, you know.  I think we should get together and talk about things that the people find important in this  thing.  What?  What is it?  Does it have to get that ridiculous?  Okay.  Chelsea, I want you to make sure your room is clean and not leave your clothes around 
[02:08:30]  where I have to pick them up.  The bullhorn.  They always get all loud.  They don't speak like human beings.  They can't answer a question.  How do you feel about AIDS?  Oh, it's a very tragic thing that we must all take to heart and look at in a way that  we can just say, yeah, but blows.  Oh, we're going to try to, you know, help out. 
[02:09:00]  They can't answer a question.  Let's go to Mitch.  Mitch, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Great.  How are you going?  Great show.  Listen, just real quick.  We did some stuff with Rick Lazio at the racetrack.  He's just a really good down-to-earth guy.  What, did you see him at the $50 window?  No, no, no.  I worked there.  No, he did toys-to-tots with the Marines, but he's the kind of guy who wasn't doing it  just so everybody could say, hey, you know, look at me.  He's a really good family guy, but he's hip enough that, you know, he listened to your 
[02:09:30]  show, he'd be okay.  Yeah.  I just encourage everybody not to turn your show political, but we live in New York, and  we can't have this, you know, we can't have this woman in the Senate.  Rick, get Lazio.  So, yeah, we want to get him on the show.  We want to get him on the show and see if he can hang with the boys.  Get him on with Lazio.  He's not a, you know, he's not your stiff Republican Mr. Missionary, man.  He's very cool.  We endorse him.  We'll find that out.  So do that, you know, and syndication when Hillary loses a strap-on.  All right, Mitch.  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Enough on that.  We'll have to learn more about him, but...  Did you see what Joe Soprano wrote earlier?  Syndication when people stop calling in with new syndication things?  Oh, what the hell.  It's quite the paradox.  Yeah, it sure is.  Dre from the city.  Did you guys watch the NRA meeting last weekend?  Yeah.  Charlton Heston spoke, and it was like a scene from Planet of the Apes.  He was holding a big rifle and yelling.  What do you know something?  I was going to say, you know something? 
[02:10:30]  I am a very strong advocate to the right to bear arms.  I really am.  I'm serious.  But that Charlton Heston is an effing lunatic.  He's out of his mind.  That guy is crazy.  Looking more and more like an ape every day.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look exactly like Dr. Zayas.  Yeah.  He's getting the big protruding jaw.  Dr. Zayas, help me.  Nira Cornelius, help me. 
[02:11:00]  There.  We got him.  He looks just like him.  Damn you.  He did that famous line.  Make it up my gun when they pry my cold dead fingers from around you.  Damn you all to hell.  And he had the rifle up in the air.  He was holding it like Moses helped his staff.  Yeah.  And he's like, oh, damn you.  I was expecting him to fire a few rounds off into the steel.  Damn you all to hell. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Anti-gun people.  F off.  I treated those gorillas on Planet of the Apes with my gun.  Remember that?  I shot them all, bastards.  Then I pulled Dr. Zayas to come around the corner.  And I put my gun to his head.  That red monkey answered him.  I believe it is the right of every American to have a Vulcan cannon in his car if he wants one. 
[02:12:00]  Damn you.  And what's the problem?  Why?  Why a problem with the theme restaurant in Times Square?  We want an NRA theme restaurant along with Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock and the Sports Guest.  Hey.  Mr. Heston, that's a little wacky.  Why damn you?  NRA theme restaurant in Times Square.  Why?  What's the difference? 
[02:12:30]  It's a hobby.  A sport like everyone else.  Why can you have goddamn hippie communist clothes hanging up in the Hard Rock?  But you can't have good old American guns in a restaurant.  That's what a restaurant needs.  Come on.  We could serve the children little, like, sundaes after they eat.  Ice cream sundaes with, like, Magnum Rounds decorating it.  That'd be cute. 
[02:13:00]  You'd take them home.  Little guns hanging up all over the place.  They're out of their mind, though.  In our theme restaurant.  Because we were at the All-Star Cafe.  Yes.  And we ordered the Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Or whatever it was.  Why have that when you can have Ruby Ridge ribs?  Come on, damn you.  How about the Columbine cobbler salad?  Yes.  It's on the menu.  Or if you're watching the game.  Yeah.  What would be better than sitting down with some wacky Waco wigs? 
[02:13:30]  Hot wigs.  Come on, damn you.  Mr. Heston, don't forget about the Luima lasagna.  Yes.  That'd be great.  All the waitstaff and I'm cunt.  So if anyone tries to walk out on the check, we shoot them.  Could you imagine that?  The Kent State College crunchy chicken finger. 
[02:14:00]  There's just a few things on the menu.  Damn you.  I'll treat you like that red ass, mandrin monkey ass, gorilla ass that was trying to get me.  I'm planning the ass.  Can I say ass one more time?  Charlton Heston.  Yes.  Will you be like a hostess at the restaurant?  I'll be the hostess.  I'll be the hostess.  Yeah.  It's fully armed. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  When you order a steak, you go in the back and shoot at yourself.  Come on.  It's in your 30-on-six and you'll just pluck it off.  Pass that dumb cow over the head.  We'll hold his feet.  We'll head him and heel him with the rope.  You take out the .357 right between the horns.  And then, oh, it's so tender and juicy that way. 
[02:15:00]  Would you like it well done or rare so it's red like Zira's monkey ass?  Some days I'll be dressed in a loincloth.  Oh, yuck.  Some days in a loincloth.  Some days in my outfit I had in the Omega Man.  Remember that movie?  Sure do.  What did I have in the Omega Man?  Guns and plenty of them to shoot the dead.  What happens if we're overrun with the living dead and we don't have guns to defend ourselves? 
[02:15:30]  What happens if we don't have guns in this country and all of a sudden gorillas take over?  Would you like to be like those mindless people held in cages being dissected?  Or would you like to be like Chuck Heston when I see the Statue of Liberty and I fight back with my gun?  Damn you!  You blew it up!  Remember, every Chuck Heston movie you see, where I have a gun, I come out on top! 
[02:16:00]  Although I died in Planet of the Apes, I died in the Omega Man, I died in Soylent Green.  Wait a minute.  Oh, that didn't work out too well.  I didn't have a gun in Ten Commandments and I lived.  I didn't have a gun in Ben Hearn, I made through that.  I died in the Omega Man.  Goddamn guns are screwing me up!  I die in all my gun movies!  Anthony or Mr. Heston, whoever you are right now. 
[02:16:30]  Yes, damn you.  More and more suggestions for the NRA-themed restaurant menu coming in.  Yes.  Let's not forget the Son of Sam soup and sandwich special.  That's a good one.  The .44 caliber killer.  David from Ridgewood, New Jersey, Columbine Calamari on the appetizer.  Columbine Calamari!  Let's not forget Watts Wings.  Yes.  What about the Jack Ruby Red Wine?  Yes.  You drink that with the Cheese Harvey Oswald.  It's the burger! 
[02:17:00]  Cheese Harvey Oswald!  It's a play on the name, you doffy bastard!  Well, they have a breakfast special too, Anthony.  The Lee Harvey Omelette.  Lee Harvey Omelette.  For breakfast.  Look at the way we break the eggs.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  And then a little, a little, a little, what's her name, Kennedy?  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Tries to get the shell from the back of the trunk of the car and put it back on the egg. 
[02:17:30]  It's so cute.  Boy, I went a long way for that dopey joke.  Bloodstained tablecloths on every table.  Moses from Egypt checking in.  I'd like to order the 9mm chicken bullets with barbecue sauce up, please.  Oh, tender.  Jim, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Jim here.  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, Jim.  How about these John Wilkes Booth bacon cheeseburgers?  That's a good one.  All right.  Thank you, guys. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you, Jim.  A big stack of curly fries.  It'll be good food.  Good food and firearms.  That's what we need in Times Square.  Mr. Heston, don't forget the shooting anymore.  Don't forget about the Diablo poppers.  Get 41 per order.  Damn you.  The Sirhan Sirhanwich.  Come on.  It's a good one. 
[02:18:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Great.  All right.  I got the name for the restaurant.  It's Shooters, not Hooters.  Shooters.  It's Shooters.  And a guaranteed pair of 55 howitzers in every brassiere top.  The JFK open-faced sandwich.  What's wrong with that?  Holy cow.  Why?  Why are people so averse to guns? 
[02:19:00]  Guns with your meal.  A little happy meal for children with a little 22 Saturday night special.  You can run around and have fun shooting each other.  How about the Sirhan Slurpee?  Yes.  For dessert.  The Grassy Noe Salad Bar.  The Grassy Noe Salad Bar.  All part of the NRA-themed restaurant, right? 
[02:19:30]  The Klebold Casserole.  It's a matter.  There's endless possibilities.  Damn you.  Son of Sandwich.  Son of Ham Sandwich.  The waitress is late with your order.  Not only is it free, but you shoot the bitch.  Nova.  I taught you to smile. 
[02:20:00]  Dr. Ziss.  The Jeffrey...  Oh, God.  You guys are sick, man.  Let me get Brad to say it.  It's his line.  Brad, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  I got a name, uh...  The Jeffrey Dahmer Sampler.  Oh, God.  You can have it cold right out of the fridge.  Well, you didn't use guns, but that's close enough.  Thank you, Brad.  Yeah.  Bye.  Whoa, the hell.  That's sick.  See what I did with that gorilla?  I know. 
[02:20:30]  Beneath the planet of the Apes.  Yeah.  I shot them all!  Yes, sir.  Guns!  We need more guns in our restaurant.  Damn you!  We're going to have a special lunch.  Uh, special for postal employees, huh?  That come in.  Yeah, they bring their own guns.  Blow off some steam and some heads.  Bring in a gun, get a free, uh, appetizer?  Jesus. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, man.  A David Koresh-Kanesh.  For our Hebrew friends.  Salad with Smith and Wesson oil and vinegar.  Damn you!  All right, well.  I want to wish the NRA-themed restaurant a lot of luck there in Times Square.  Yes. 
[02:21:30]  What a mess.  Boy.  People listen to this every day?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Why?  How about...  Red mangel ass?  How about...  I want my burger raw.  Like...  Like Zira's ass when I pounded it when Cornelius was away.  He never found out.  How about the Leon...  I love monkey ass!  How about the Leon Klinghoffer cocktail?  Two shots and a splash.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, you can try the Eric Harris hot potato.  Colin Ferguson curly fries.  Colin Ferguson.  It's cute.  We'll have a little electric train set that'll bring it on for you.  To the sound of gunfire!  The kids can play in the electric chair?  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  That's right.  Damn you.  You ever pound monkey ass, Opie?  It's almost as good as shooting guns!  Anthony, let's not forget the Dwyer Bud draft.  Yes!  Very good.  That's Chris in line, too.  Thank you, Chris.  You sick F.  Oh, the Colin Ferguson curly fries. 
[02:23:00]  Yes, of course.  Yeah.  Well, it sounds a little wacky to have an NRA-themed restaurant.  Yeah.  The hell are they going to, you know...  How are they going to name the dishes?  I guess they have to guns.  Colt.  Smith & Wesson.  Ruger!  The Columbine Sloppy Joe, Anthony.  Oh, God damn!  Check, please. 
[02:23:30]  This bit's done.  Oh.  The Jack the Ripper Rubin.  Jesus.  Dahmer's 12-inch wieners.  Dahmer didn't do anything with guns.  All right, man.  All right.  Special of the day.  Mary Jo Butterfuco chops served on the side. 
[02:24:00]  Butterfuco.  Yes, the sauce is served on the side.  Paulie from Lawrence.  I assume we'll all be drinking Colt 45s.  Damn you.  The restaurant's slogan could be,  Eat hot lead,  and instead of a drive-thru,  they have a drive-by.  Amy Fisher and chips.  That's great for you English blokes  that are too faggy to have guns in your country. 
[02:24:30]  Stupid Barbies with their sticks.  One gun and they take over the whole country.  Mr. Heston Berger from New Rochelle.  Yes.  The University of Texas Clock Tower T.  That's a good one.  The Martin Luther King Size Sandwich.  What's wrong with that?  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey. 
[02:25:00]  I got two things.  Yeah.  I like to sit in my favorite John Wilkes booth  and have my Brady vegetables.  The James Brady mixed vegetables.  Very good.  All right, fellas, you guys are great.  Yeah, there'll be a booth called the John Wilkes booth.  John Lennon Lemon Chicken.  What's wrong with that? 
[02:25:30]  Hunted yourself.  Catcher in the Rye Fish Fry.  For you Beatle fans.  Shane, what's up?  How about the Bernie Gets Burrito?  Very good.  Yes.  All right, there you go, Shane.  Bernie Gets.  Kyle from Mayo Pack.  Try the Salina Salsa and Chips.  It's great.  The Manson Massacre Meat Loaf. 
[02:26:00]  Just trying to help the theme restaurant.  The John Lennon Broyal.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  All right.  Ring the bell for the love of God.  Ring the goddamn bell. 
[02:26:30]  Jim from Long Island.  Dirty Sanchez.  How about the Bobby Kennedy Special Barbecue Sauce?  How about the Phil Hartman Coke Float with Grenadine?  Got to give these people credit.  That's horrible.  That's from Xavier from Fort Chester.  Yes.  The Unicorn on the Cobb Killer. 
[02:27:00]  I ain't reading that one.  Mark David Chapman Chimichungus.  Mr. Reagan.  Mr. Reagan.  Don't forget the Ronald Reagan ribs.  And they got Biggie Small Drinks. 
[02:27:30]  Biggie Small Drinks.  That's horrible.  See, Rodney King wasn't shot, so that one doesn't work.  Stay with the bit.  Yeah, the Tupac Tacos.  Tupac Tacos.  They're great.  And all meals come with guns.  Just to blow up some rounds, the ceiling is going to be made out of cork.  So you can just fire rounds into the ceiling. 
[02:28:00]  The Invisible Man checking in.  Give me your wallet, waffle fries, and this is a robbery roast beef.  Ronald Reagan on rye.  See, they bring it to you and forget to put the filling in.  It's just rye bread.  I'll take two.  That was supposed to be a two-minute bit. 
[02:28:30]  The Andrew Cunanan banana split.  If you could get the whole thing in your mouth, it's free.  It was a fag.  Remember the fag killer down in Florida?  Yeah.  Andrew Cunanan.  Yeah.  Isn't that the food company?  You can try the Reagan Mind Eraser drink.  The Kent State cannoli for dessert. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you, Bill.  We did the Smith & Wesson omelet.  The Diallo stew.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Those are sick, man.  God, we came up with four in the back office.  I thought we were doing good.  Very good.  Very good, guys.  Damn it.  Very good.  Right there in Times Square.  The NRA theme restaurant. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Opening within the year.  Hopefully, make the WWF restaurant seem like Tavern on the Green.  How about a James Earl Ray on Rye?  Come on.  There can't be possibly more.  Kurt Cobain Lo Man.  Thank you, Dan.  Dan from New City.  How about the Notorious B.I.G. Burger? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  The barber from Jersey.  He's a funny guy.  How about trying the Bloods and Crips Fish and Chips?  A large pie with Malcolm Extra Anchovies.  People are bad, man.  The JFK Jr. Seafood Platter.  He didn't even get shot.

Versace veal.  We're driving home.  We're peeing our pants.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming up.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Damn you.  Why?  Oh, no.  Special of the day. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, boy.  The Taxicab Chicken Livery Sandwich.  Oh, wow.  I thought we were bad.  Our listeners are ten times worse than we are.  The Cobain head of lettuce.  Oh.  All right.  I can't imagine there's more out there.  No, I think we covered every major shooting in the past 50 years or so. 
[02:31:30]  We go back to practically 200.  Yes.  I forget about that.  I'll say it.  My brother's got an obscure one.  Go ahead.  The Leon Shogul's Shrimp.  He's the guy who shot McKinley, people.  Don't you read the history books?  Leon Shogul's.  All right.  The Pope John Paul Poppers. 
[02:32:00]  Now, you know, you guys.  Come on.  How did people forget he was shot?  Shot.  The Pope.  Parker from the city.  The Columbine Cacciatore.  The Manson Manicotti.  You kill him, we grill him.  Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  How about the 44-calibre kebab and coke?  Kebab. 
[02:32:30]  Where are you going, man?  All right.  Adam on line four.  Livery cab crab cakes.  All right.  And for a beverage, if you really want to get snuggered,  the Long Island Railroad Shooting Ice Team.  Oh, boo.  Come on.  It's an iced tea.  O.J. didn't shoot anyone.  Yes.  Stop it.  Cut it out.  Who cares?  It's for the knife restaurant opening up down the street. 
[02:33:00]  Malcolm X.  Tra.  Cheese Pizza.  Yes.  Stop it.  A Ramsey one.  Stop it.  She was.  The strangulation restaurant.  The Hinkley hamburger meal for kids.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're done.  Can you say overkill?  Yeah, we kill everything.  We don't kill.  Zoe, I kill her birthday cake. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  I'll thank you for your contributions, you sick.  Aaron Burritos. 
[02:34:00]  Aaron Burritos.  Aaron Burritos.  Aaron Bur.  Someone really knows their history.  Aaron Burrito.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  That's a good one, man.  You guys were getting historical, so I reached back for the Aaron Burritos.  Yes.  Enlighten the people as to who he was in a duel with.  Oh, he shot somebody a while ago.  I'm not exactly sure who. 
[02:34:30]  Al Hamilton.  Oh, God.  Alan Bur.  Very good.  He was in that peanut butter commercial.  Yeah.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, fellas.  All right.  We're done.  I think we're done.  She wasn't shot.  But it is funny that Sharon Tater talks. 
[02:35:00]  God damn.  Larry Flynn fries?  Yeah, Larry Flynn was shot.  All right.  That's why we call it the People's Radio Show.  You guys are crazy.  That's not what I'm picking this one.  Martin Luther King crap place. 
[02:35:30]  The Diallo.  Just when you want to stop the bit.  Ray, on line nine.  The Diallo Hammond Swiss.  Oh, these people are out there.  Oh, Narene Shatner floats.  She drowned you a hole.  And she certainly didn't float.  God, we came up with seven in the background. 
[02:36:00]  We've had about a hundred on the radio.  Daddy Hurst, liverwurst.  You're killing me.  Damn them all the hell.  Right.  All right.  I think we need to take a break, Anthony.  Please.  Because I'm not stopping.  Well, if a few good ones come through during the commercials, we'll get right back on. 
[02:36:30]  Stay there.  Okay.  We're finished.  You guys in conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  You people are totally out of control.  Mike from Brooklyn.  The David Berkowitz hot dogs.  They speak for themselves.  You idiots.  Psycho Mark's at the Staten Island Ferry.  Giving out wow stickers.  He's on the Manhattan side.  Look for him.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:37:00]  Brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show.  We've been drinking this the entire show.  Yeah.  Sobe beverages, Anthony.  Yes.  The leader in healthy refreshment.  We got like, we got thousands of them in our office.  I've been drinking the Sobe Energy.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  Very tasty, right, Anthony?  It's got a guarana, yohimbi, and what, arginine?  I don't know what those things are, but I guess they're good for you.  Let me tell you what they do.  It feels like, I swear to God, it feels like I drank about 50 cups of coffee. 
[02:37:30]  I know why they call it energy.  Yeah.  I drank half of it, and I swear, I was like, oh, my God, I'm freaking out.  And I'm on my third bottle.  I know.  I'm addicted to this stuff already.  Oh, finish his one off, and he's like, go in the office, grab another one.  Yeah.  I need another Sobe Energy.  No, I like this Sobe stuff.  Sobe beverages.  We have like, I don't know, 10 or 12 different kinds in the office.  We're trying the energy drink today, and it's very, very tasty. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Sobe Energy contains an energizing herbal package with guarana.  Yes.  Instant energy.  Is that what that does?  Yohimbi to sustain energy, and Arginine to enhance overall physical performance, Anthony.  Well, let me tell you, I was doing like sit-ups in the corner to get rid of some energy during commercials.  I felt like the top of my head was going to blow off.  I think I found a new beverage. 
[02:38:30]  I think you did.  I'm not kidding.  This stuff is really good.  Sobe beverage provides supplemental herbs designed to energize the body, uplift the spirit, and enlighten the mind.  And we're liking this stuff big time.  And it tastes really good.  Uh-huh.  Like, I like it, as opposed to, you know, like sports drinks or something.  Let's say they give you energy.  You know, they might, but the taste is like, ugh.  Yeah.  This is really good stuff.  Yeah, we like it a lot.  They have a website.  Everybody has a website. 
[02:39:00]  Theirs is www.sobebev.com.  Sobebev.com for more info about Sobe and all of their different flavors, Anthony.  They have a lot of them.  What does that mean?  What?  Well, they got an under-the-cap game going on, too.  Yeah.  So you take the cap off and obviously look under it.  Yeah.  Mine just says, the other white meat.  Does it really?  Supposedly, there's like all kinds of stuff under the cap, so they'll let you laugh if you don't win something.  Yeah, they're pretty funny. 
[02:39:30]  And be on the lookout for the Sobe Lizard Love Bus, spreading the Sobe experience all over the market, Anthony.  All right.  So grab a Sobe and drain the lizard.  Sobe Beverages, the brand new sponsor.  It's a pleasure to the Opie and Anthony show, and we definitely are digging their stuff today, okay?  We'll be back.  Hey, while you're listening to O&A, I'm out throwing chicken wings at people.  This is Jim Briller.  Take that up, you stinker.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:40:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Having fun today.  Want to say hi to everyone that's hanging out, getting ready for the fifth show tonight.  Sold-out show at Radio City Music Hall tonight.  Tomorrow, they're playing Roseland.  Our own Stinky, very excited.  He's got his wristband.  He's going to the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we need Spaz to smell Stinky, though.  Stinky, you waited all day for tickets?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, it's like 1.30 in the morning.  You got there 1.30 in the morning to try to get your tickets? 
[02:40:30]  Yep.  And how good are your tickets for tomorrow's show?  I think they're all general omission, so it depends on when I get there.  All right.  Now, I think he stinks today, Anthony.  The ho Cincinnati all over again.  Where's Spaz?  He's got to smell you today.  He walked into the office, and I'm like, man, who farted?  And Stinky goes, oh, it could be me.  I've been up all night trying to get fish tickets.  Spaz, does he smell? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know.  I haven't smelled him.  Well, Stinky, you know, raise your arm.  Stinky.  Make it audible in the mic.  No lying.  Man, we don't fake anything in the show.  No lying.  He's right.  Right?  Well, I took a shower before I left.  Stinky, just when we were ready to, you know, give you a brand new nickname, man.  You had to come in like that today.  When you stink once and you get the name Stinky, it might eventually go away.  You're going to the appropriate show today, Fish. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Spaz, not good, huh?  You didn't smell the other underarm.  The left one, please, Spazzy.  Lift up the shirt.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, that's long.  Get in there.  Into the mic.  Into the mic.  We didn't hear anything.  Oh, God.  I'm going to puke.  That's disgusting.  That's good for him.  All right, Stinky.  I'm glad you got the fish tickets, but a shower would be nice. 
[02:42:00]  The Fredo Fettuccine.  Very good.  Alfalfa, alfalfa sprouts.  That's right.  He died of a gunshot.  That's what they say.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  A lot of good shows this week.  Local H at Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  Mm-hmm.  Wednesday, Matchbox 20 at Irving Plaza Friday.  She's coming back Friday?  That's her makeup show.  That's the makeup show when she had that nervous breakdown on stage a couple months ago?  She's going to cry some more, Fiona. 
[02:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  My monitors don't work.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Fiona Apple at Beacon Theater Friday.  God, give her the finger.  Mm-hmm.

[02:43:00]  Oh, jeez.  Hey, I'm just reading them as I see them.  I see that, Anthony.  In other music news, Kid Rock appearing on WWF's Raw is War next Monday.  Bye-bye, Kid Rock.  Should be fun.  Yeah, I don't think he has much time left in the world of fame.  You see him on Saturday Night Live at all?  Yeah.  Catch that?  Yeah.  Joe C dressed as an old lady was pretty funny, though.  Yeah.  No, dressed as, what was that bit? 
[02:43:30]  Dressed as, well, the guy.  I saw the end of the show.  Oh, okay.  Jerry Lewis, right?  Jerry Lewis, who married his little...  Jerry Lee Lewis.  Yeah, Jerry Lee Lewis.  Joe C was the chick.  All right, Ant.  Oh, God.  I'm just...  My chest hurts from laughing.  Yeah, you guys killed us today.  We've got to talk about the road show again, Anthony.  Yeah.  This is going to be so freaking cool. 
[02:44:00]  We're very excited.  I hope you guys are excited to join us Thursday.  We're doing our summer kickoff party.  The festivities start.  I know, they're still coming in.  Doors open at 2, Anthony.  We're going to start broadcasting live at 3 this coming Thursday.  Yeah.  21 and older.  It's happening at the South Beach Dance Club.  50 Broadway, Island Park.  We've got directions on the WNW website and the unofficial O.P. and Anthony website.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I think we could fit about 2,000 people at this road show. 
[02:44:30]  It's going to be the biggest road show yet.  Yeah.  These road shows, legendary.  And every day, we're adding more debauchery to the schedule.  Mm-hmm.  To the festivities, we're doing a huge WOW wet t-shirt contest with cash prizes.  We're doing some lesbian stuff.  We've got the Spaz dunk tank with Spaz in a Boy Scout uniform.  Go ahead, Ann.  Share it with the class.  The Brandon Lee Rice pudding from Matt.  Matt. 
[02:45:00]  That's just bad.  We're going to have a best sign contest because you guys bring all the cool signs to the road shows.  Otto and George, confirmed.  Jeff Norris, confirmed.  Stephen Lynch, most likely confirmed, just waiting.  And I think the hit of the road show is going to be Fuel and Q singing their most offensive songs,  the ones you know and love.  My brother Joe, too, with All Mine Fury.  That's right.  Your brother Joe is going to be singing one live.  Yes.  Fuel is going to sing Baby Raper and Camp Concentration. 
[02:45:30]  I'm trying to remember who sang who.  Sang what?  Q is doing Horny for Little Girls.  I'm horny.  And what was the other one?  Imagine.  Imagine.  That's right.  Imagine.  Imagine there's no...  Remember that one?  That's going to be just huge.  No cover charge.  So get there early and celebrate the summer kickoff with us, okay?  I love that song.  Absolutely love that song.  So it's at South Beach Dance Club this Thursday, 50 Broadway, Island Park on Long Island.

Can you see this one?  Which one?  Oh, God.  I ain't reading that.  That's over the top.  Over the top.  What about the Mama Cass ham sandwich?  It's not funny because it's...  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  See, what makes the bit funny, it's all about shootings.  It's the NRA-themed restaurant.  See, that's the joke.  Right.  That's why the JonBenet Ramsey baby back ribs isn't funny.  Please.  That's why the Reverend Jim Jones fruit punch.  Not a joke.  The son of sandwich at the NRA cafe.  Genghis going on the con.  No.  See, you're going back a little far.  How about the Ferguson fries and two pock nuggets? 
[02:47:00]  Bit is done.  Please.  Bit is done.  People, John...  Oh, that's...  Cardinal O'Connor on the con.  What are you...  Well, see, this one makes sense.  The Rebecca Schaefer shoestring french fries.  She was the chick from my sister, Sam.  Of course.  You all remember her.  All right, and what else did we forget to talk about today?  We talked about the Knicks.  We talked about Lazio. 
[02:47:30]  Lazio, whatever you want to call him.  Yeah.  Of course, Chuck Heston.  Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  Lazio's new campaign slogan, you fill my ballot box, I'll fill yours.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  The John Lennon meringue pie.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  It's not a Bob Crane hero.  Bob Crane was bludgeoned. 
[02:48:00]  Bludgeoned.  Oh.  You guys got to know your murder.  Please.  All right.  Yes.  Oh, who was Superman?  Who was Superman?  George Reeves.  George Reeves.  Yeah.  He shot himself, right?  Superman.  Yes, he did.  Hmm.  Eh.  I'm just looking.  Stacy chick kept emailing a website with her pictures on it.  She's got her at 18, her at 19, and her at 22. 
[02:48:30]  Not bad, Stacy.  Very good.  Look at that.  Does she want to come in tomorrow?  Like Jane's at 18.  Ooh.  That's a fan of the show?  That can't be a fan of the show.  I don't know.  Now she's 23.  Wait.  Go back to the 18.  Wow.  Is she a fan of the show, though?  I don't know.  I keep getting the instant feedback. 
[02:49:00]  Stacy, give us an email address or something.  Oh, if Stockbroker Dave's out there, please give us a call.  We definitely want you to come in tomorrow.  Yeah.  We're playing Win Stockbroker Dave's Money Tomorrow.  It's a brand new bid on the O.P. Anthony Show.  We played it once, and it was just a huge success.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  Stockbroker Dave comes in with just a wad of money.  Anthony says that he gave out $400 last time.  Right?  Yeah, $400.  All he wanted was a girl to make a wiffle ball bat disappear. 
[02:49:30]  She made the handle disappear, that's for sure.  We marked it with a Sharpie.  Now we can't play wiffle ball in our office anymore, but we do have the bat, and I'm sure  there will be girls out there to try to set the record.  But basically, how you win Stockbroker Dave's Money, Anthony.  Win Stockbroker Dave's Money.  He comes in with a wad of money.  You get a chance to win my money by doing sexual things.  Right. 
[02:50:00]  Don't say Jew.  All ladies are invited tomorrow.  Just show up at the station.  What time?  What time should they show up?  Around four?  Yeah, because Dave's got to wait for the market to close.  Yeah.  Something called the finances of the free world.  Yeah, he's coming down with a bunch of his buddies.  So around four o'clock, we'll get a bunch of ladies to come on in.  We'll line them up, and then Dave will just suggest things to do, and he'll just start  peeling off hundreds.  Peeling off hundreds. 
[02:50:30]  And a girl will step forward and do the thing, and take home some fine money.  Do the thing.  That's how it works.  Dude, it's not funny, because the Cosby guy wasn't shy.  He was?  Yeah, he was.  Cosby somewhere.  Oh, yeah, he was.  Okay.  The Enos Cosby crumb cake.  It's so done.  Please.  Yeah, it's done.  Kenny, what's going on?  Kenny! 
[02:51:00]  Yeah?  Don't listen to your radio, man.  That's a delay.  Let's go.  Oh, uh, it's a vacation where Rosie O'Donnell leads at the NRA restaurant.  Yeah.  That's all I got.  Thank God.  We'd go broke if she ate there.  Thank you, Kenny.  The Amy Fisher clam special.  Go ahead.  Someone wants to know if Old Dirty will be at the road show.  He's been on hiatus.  Is he going to come out of retirement to join us Thursday?  I hope so.  That would be nice.  All right, Ant.  SSPO.  Oh, I think we've talked about everything. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  We've talked about everything that's going on around us today.  Yes, we certainly did.  So why don't we take a break and come back with our favorite game.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Correct.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  And I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony, uh, Rockaway Bedding.  I love my Rockaway Bedding bed. 
[02:52:00]  It's huge.  Soft.  It's comfortable.  They delivered it without any problems.  That's what they do.  Over 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey featuring brand-name mattresses.  You've heard them all.  And prices up to 65% below department store price.  Why would you go to the department store?  Just the other day, I laugh now every time I see it.  I saw a minivan driving down the Bell Parkway with a mattress tied to the roof. 
[02:52:30]  And it was acting like, you know when you take a flight and the plane lands and those things flap up and...  Sure.  Yeah.  It was acting like one of those.  You just heard it and it was bending.  Why do you want to cart the mattress home when Rockaway Bedding will deliver it free?  And give you the free steel bed frame.  They set it up for you.  Complete removal of your old bedding.  It's great.  Rockaway Bedding.  You can buy headboards, metal beds, futons, day beds, electric beds, bunk beds. 
[02:53:00]  Anything else you need to sleep.  Get it at Rockaway Bedding.  It's the fastest growing chain of mattress stores in New York and New Jersey.  For a reason, the best price is friendly service.  Free, free delivery to your home.  You can shop at one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or give them a call.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  The list of people here with Rockaway Bedding mattresses, they're off the hook, Opie.  Jay Moore, myself, and now, of course, the lovely Erica and Spaz. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to be added to that list soon, too.  Wow, that's beginning to be a crowded, crowded mattress.  I need a new bed.  Rockaway Bedding.  Give them a call.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  And it's time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  I believe we learned a lot.  Bob and Jersey will start it off, Anthony.  Wow signs are being given out on Beaver and Broad Street today.  You just can't make up this effing stuff.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Ponderous.  That's right.  We were giving away wow stickers on Beaver and Broad Street.  Yep.  Brian from New Rochelle.  What did I learn today?  Well, SI Queen's balloon knot is tighter than Anthony with his few remaining bucks. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  I learned that Staten Island Live will soon go the way of indialink.com.  It's silive.com.  Yes.  I'm trying to get through the instant feedback, but they're still coming.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Very cool.  So they're still going with the theme restaurant, the NRA theme restaurant dishes. 
[02:55:00]  That was a fun bit today.  Hey, Ryan, what did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys?  I learned two things.  First thing I learned is that you can take pictures with the invisible man at the road show.  That's right.  Or money will be used to provide wow stickers at all toll booths.  Very good.  The second thing is your syndication in Bangor, Maine just got pushed back from 2042 to 2075 thanks to the NRA bit.  Yeah, I think you're right.  All right.  Syndication when a precious visits Aunt B's grave. 
[02:55:30]  Later, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to James.  James, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, ONA.  I learned today that if you've got a problem with wow in Staten Island, your chat room is going to be destroyed.  Yes.  That's pretty much it.  Boy, the troops came through.  Yeah, we finally decided to fight back.  Yeah, guys, I called earlier and I was on hold for a while.  And then Spaz told me to call back tomorrow about the Earl thing.  Yeah.  So I'll call you guys tomorrow and I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Earl is dead.  Well, I...  He's dead in our eyes. 
[02:56:00]  He could go on whatever radio show he wants.  I don't care.  Bash us.  It doesn't matter to us anymore.  He's done.  It took us 15 minutes to do his job today, by the way.  15 minutes.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Something that takes him all day.  It took us 15 minutes to get the wow stickers out today.  You won't be seeing him at the party Thursday.  What I learned today on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is good.  John from the city.  Badge or vag will get you into the road show Thursday.  Oh.  Very good.

Thank you, man.  What do you got, man?  I learned that the word cute has been added to Anthony's vocabulary.  Cute.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I also learned that you got the sickest listeners.  We love you guys.  We love you a lot.  It's an indication when Anthony finds another Wendy.  All right, Izzy.  There it is.  Well, then it might not take as long to talk. 
[02:57:30]  Let's go to Richie.  Richie, what did you learn today?  Hello?  Hey.  What did you learn today, Richie?  I learned that girls with big, beautiful breasts are uptight driving through toll booths.  Yeah, it seemed that way.  Yeah.  At least one.  A indication under big breasts.  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Jeremy, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned a good meal at the NRA diners.  The B-I-G-B-L-T.  And the best dessert is the chocolate Truff-Elean-Gonzalez. 
[02:58:00]  Why is Elian Gonzalez in there?  Yeah.  There was a gun to his head, doesn't that count?  Yeah, that's close enough.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Jeremy.  I'm a marginal.  Bye.  We've got to give a website, some acknowledgement here, Anthony.  Yeah?  Somebody working really hard for the O&A show.  We appreciate that.  www.thehellhole.com.  Thehellhole.com?  Thehellhole.com.  It's an O&A message board. 
[02:58:30]  Hmm.  Done by one of our listeners.  I've got to type it in before the delay kicks in.  Thehellhole.com.  I think it's linked to our unofficial site as well.  Oh, wow.  There's a lot of stuff on there.  Today, I learned that Opie sometimes has problems swallowing his pot pie.  Pete from Jersey.  Wow.  That was right at the beginning of the show.  Yeah, thehellhole.com.  It's a South Park site. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, really?  Why is that?  Well, it has an O&A message board section.  Oh.  Paulie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that NBC is the home for Kitty Camelto.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How about the Vietnam Viennese table at the NRA restaurant?  Dude, we are so done with that, dude.  Take it easy, boys.  Thank you, Paulie.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, you're next on WNEW.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today, I learned that O&A bits are like the New York Knicks.  They refuse to go away.  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  I think you're right.  That's good.  All right, guys.  I'll see you Thursday.  Cheering on my brother, Fuel.  Thank you.  All right.  Ah.  Yeah, Fuel.  Performing live at our road show Thursday.  Can't wait.  Hey, Precious.  Have a wonderful birthday tomorrow.  With love.  Nana.  Nana.  Nana.  I can't wait.  I'm going to have so much fun.  All right.  I'm just waiting for them to screen the calls. 
[03:00:00]  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what did you learn on the show today?  Kevin.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  What did you learn?  I learned that Pax Ewing's three worst things that he did with a finger roll to fade away  and when he let Charlton Heston out of that bamboo cage.  Jesus, Kevin.  Thank you, Kevin.  Yeah, you guys rule.  All right.  Bye.  Are we just about done?  I would hope so.  I can't take it anymore.  Today, I learned that you guys talked about everything except the Yankees banning beer 
[03:00:30]  from your most loyal fans.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's that about?  They're banning beer from the bleachers.  What the hell's that all about?  What the hell are they doing?  You want us to sit there for four hours without beer?  Without beer.  Great.  That's ridiculous.  They can't take our beer away from us.  Oh, they seem pretty restrained over there.  Yeah.  You know, they get into the game and everything, but I don't know.  Sat in that section. 
[03:01:00]  It's a lot of fun.  I've had it with people taking away the beer.  They're taking away everything, Anthony.  I guess there's nothing you can do about that.  Who's going to get on the bandwagon to bring the beer back?  You know?  Who's going to...  A politician's going to go, we need the beer back.  Yeah.  And bring the beer back to the bleachers where it belongs.  What's Billy Carter doing?  Or is he dead?  Yeah.  He kicked the bucket.  That platform.  We need a drunk. 
[03:01:30]  That's why you'll never see Times Square the way it used to be.  You'll never see bottomless dancing back in New York, because once they take it away,  there's no politician that's going to get on the bandwagon to do that.  The bottomless dancer must return to this state.  It doesn't happen.  Everyone's saying, we can get rid of the booby dancers.  That's a good point.  And then you make concessions like, okay, we'll cover up the bottom, we'll put pasties  on them, and then each one you give, you never get it back again.  There used to be bottomless dancing in New York. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  John from Union, New Jersey.  Today, I learned that September 14th was the day that Anthony was reborn.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Are we done?  We should be done.  It's over, Jenny.  Jay Moore checking in.  Really?  This can't be the real Jay Moore. 
[03:02:30]  I wouldn't think so.  Today, I learned that if there's a bit worth doing, it's a bit, excuse me, worth killing  with a big gun.  Dan from New York City.  All right.  Trisha, what's up?  Hey, I learned today that I can make money by learning how to swallow a whipple ball back.  Swallow?  Oh, no, dear.  It has nothing to do with swallowing.  Oh, no.  You've got to make it disappear.  Yeah, well, sucking it in. 
[03:03:00]  I didn't know what proper words I could use.  No, no, no.  You're making it sound like the mouth is involved.  No.  The mouth has nothing to do with it.  But there's lips, right?  Ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Very good.  Be careful.  They're going to dump out of you.  Now you're talking.  That's not what we're doing tomorrow to win Stockbroker Dave's money, by the way.  Well, I think it would be a good part-time job.  Dave is coming up with a brand-new thing for the ladies to do to win his big wad of cash.  To win my money. 
[03:03:30]  If there's ladies out there that are desperate for cash, be around the station around 4 o'clock.  We'll invite you in here.  Oh, definitely.  We'll line you up, and we'll see how much money it's going to take to do something that Dave has in mind, okay?  Okay.  And since syndication isn't happening, we'll just push for fornication.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Trisha.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Are we still done?  Yeah.  No, we're done. 
[03:04:00]  Great boudoir.  Okay.  Yeah, we're definitely done.  Whoa.  Guys, thanks for listening today.  It was fun.  A lot of fun.  We'll see you tomorrow for my birthday.  Yeah.  How about that?  Opie's B-Day tomorrow.  God, no hookers tomorrow, man.  God, I wrecked my birthday last year.  I want to dash it.  None of that.  I want to dash it.  Let me see it.  Check it out, puppy.  I want to dash it.  And just remember, for your birthday this year, I was on your side. 
[03:04:30]  I made sure you had a very good time.  I had nothing to do with planning the thing, but I made sure it didn't go too far.  I had a fun birthday.  So help me out tomorrow.  Oh, old dirty with the beads last year with the girl.  Well, that was fun to check out.  Yeah.  It was just the hookers that wanted to dash it.  I want to dash it.  I want to dash it.  Let me see.  I want to dash it.  Poppy.  I want to dash it.  Fantastic. 
[03:05:00]  Dan's from Long Island.  It might be Denise.  I don't know.  I learned the less that Spaz participates in the show, the better the show is.  Yeah.  I don't know.  A lot of people like the Spaz stuff.  Well, we've got to go to Steve to end the show.  As you know, we're doing the Roadshow Thursday.  Steve, what did you learn on the show today?  Well, I learned today that I guess Friday's going to be a best of Opie and Anthony.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Yeah, you deserve it.  Long weekend for the boys after the Roadshow. 
[03:05:30]  That's it.  You deserve it.  You're right, Steve.  Thank you.  Take care.  Very observant, our listeners, Anthony.  Yes.  Roadshow Thursday.  Very excited.  We'll give more details tomorrow, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Hey, guys, thanks for listening.  We definitely appreciate that.  You want to give out Warped Tour tickets as we leave here?  Warped Tour.
