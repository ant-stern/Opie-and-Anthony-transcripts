<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie's discovery of topless Megan Fox pictures online, sparking a discussion about judging attractiveness in silent film stars.  A caller, Jesse, interjected with his bathroom reading habits.  The conversation then turned to President Obama's recent speech, criticized for its excessive applause breaks, followed by a debate on the speech's impact and the feasibility of Obama's policy goals, including curing cancer.  News stories followed: a 16-year-old running a prostitution ring, a Mardi Gras shooting, and the "Turkish Sully" emergency landing.  A lengthy segment was dedicated to a satirical *Lost* recap, interspersed with mentions of upcoming guests 50 Cent and Bobby Kelly.  The show also covered a topless coffee shop in Maine, a dentist accused of groping patients, and Carolyn McCarthy's gun control advocacy, with the hosts frequently using vulgar language.

The show continued with a rambling discussion on gun control, triggered by a listener's question about a politician inheriting her husband's position.  This led to tangents on the Colin Ferguson shooting, the legality of the firearm used, the Second Amendment, and numerous caller opinions on gun ownership and the NRA.  A heated exchange occurred between Anthony and caller Mike on gun rights.  13-year-old JC contributed his history teacher's perspective on the "well-regulated militia" clause.  In-studio guests Rich Voss and Jim Norton participated, with Voss recounting humorous (and often shocking) childhood anecdotes, including wearing his sister's underwear and making booger sculptures.  A call from Voss's daughter, Jess, inadvertently revealed more of his past indiscretions.  The segment included further discussions of upcoming appearances and jokes, all laced with vulgar language.

A gameplay segment featured a caller, "Bobby," playing "50 Cent: Blood on the Sand," with Opie and Anthony providing commentary filled with expletives.  They riffed on the game's violence, graphics, and portrayal of Middle Eastern settings.  50 Cent then joined in studio, discussing his career, business ventures (Vitamin Water), experiences performing for soldiers in Iraq, navigating the hip-hop industry, and his feud with Rick Ross.  He detailed his business strategies, the game's creation, and past experiences, including being shot.  He also explained his public takedown of Rick Ross, highlighting the use of legal resources.  The segment concluded with promotion for the game and 50 Cent's radio show.

The show included a Carbonite.com commercial, followed by discussions with Jim Norton and Rich Voss in studio.  Voss promoted his upcoming comedy show featuring a "funniest listener" contest.  The conversation then jumped to a Turkish plane crash, leading to discussions about plane safety, used aircraft sales, a listener joke, the death of Isadora Duncan (potentially), Jim Norton's fashion and smoking habits.  A significant portion focused on a hypothetical stand-up routine of a burned comedian, with graphic descriptions of injuries and self-deprecating jokes.  The hosts and guests brainstormed scenarios, including a wheelchair-bound comedian, utilizing offensive jokes and stereotypes, alongside a played clip of a comedian in a wheelchair.  The show concluded with further vulgar jokes and banter.

[00:03:00]  not about silent film stars but a couple have popped up in this book it's a very morbid book  about uh uh very and uh uh creative people and how they end up dying i think i've mentioned this  book a couple times it's kind of my bathroom reading book yeah but i mean there i read a couple  pages this thing is taking forever to to you know read or the american rifleman but yeah it goes it 
[00:03:30]  goes from a to z all these people i i just did the kinnison little little synopsis i mean every star  has maybe a page yeah why they were great and how they died have your picture in there you with  kinnison oh showing him with a young boy yeah make a wish foundation picture and last night i'm i'm  reading about this um silent film star that died by the time she was 27 but i guess she was all the  rage old age back then and she was she was known for her sexuality seducing men hubba hubba uh she 
[00:04:00]  had some problem where in front of the judge the judge's like go home you're too you're too pretty  you're too gorgeous you're too sexy just go home right you're too white so i'm looking at this  picture going all right they're saying this girl is like a sex pot uh-huh and then i came to the  conclusion how can you tell when a silent film star is a sex pot yeah and then uh like you look  at pictures of the pics you look at pictures of megan fox you're like hello right yeah you know  you but you look at uh pictures of any silent film star how do you know if they were hot 
[00:04:30]  they all had that weird look to them they all look like miss crabtree from uh the little rascals  exactly they'll have the miss crabtree look yeah and i think miss crabtree was hot  if i'm not mistaken how can you tell that's what i'm getting at because they all have that  wacky hairdo they had tight little curls against their head they also had dresses that covered up  their curves everything their boobs they're everything and they all had really dark hair 
[00:05:00]  that they kind of plastered to their head or the platinum blonde hair that they plastered to the  head the hairstyle was exactly the same but uh it looked like kind of a hair helmet with a couple  curls were they hot i don't know that's what i'm getting at how do you tell if these these broads  back then were hot i don't know they're actually judged on on bone structure the cheek the high  high the cheekbones or the facial structure originally no oh like how well they could take  a punch how well they could uh how well they enjoyed a coke bottle i love old fatty arbuckle 
[00:05:30]  how much she could drink without burping uh let's say hi to jesse in new jersey jesse how are you  good morning boys hi good morning uh oh how many volumes in that book you got there because  everybody knows if you're a poopy schedule you should have been through it in about a day  let's see here's the problem my friend i i do at least three when i get here so i'm reading a lot  of newspapers in there when i go home it's a little you know it's a little just it's a little uh 
[00:06:00]  a little maintenance that's a that's about it maintenance just a little maintenance you know  maybe a leaky oh maybe a leftover you know what that needs to yuck  i hate hearing about those things i know you do it's all right what are you gonna do what are you  gonna do so so that's uh that's but that's what i was uh thinking about silent film stars and why 
[00:06:30]  what makes them hot yeah because they didn't they weren't allowed to show off their bodies  no you can't really tell so i think it was all in the eyes yes very expressive eyes like mary  pickfoot america's sweetheart yeah she uh had those expressive eyes i was also had to look around all  confused i was also reading about a guy i gotta i gotta bring the names in because they're they're  who gives a crap people but back when they were living and doing their craft they were bigger than  anything right there was this one guy he was a silent film star and i i guess he was the box 
[00:07:00]  office draw like he was the biggest and it and it's not everyone's going to try to come up with a name  it's not some of the names you might know from the silent film era and then the talkies came to be  right so they're like all right well he's the biggest star oh no now all we need now people lucky  you don't get to hear him but he sound like david they were hinting that he had a very  a little feminine a bit of broadway in him yeah and that's not how he was portrayed on the silent 
[00:07:30]  film screen on the silent film screen yeah he was all man using his eyes and his movements and her  she's hot who's that mary pickford yeah that's mary pickford that was just a guess that's the only  the only one i know like her hair is very long and down which is there but very unconditioned  when i don't think yeah conditioner back then it's very frizzy hair yeah but uh she's kind of  pretty average she's average yeah but you know i think it's because hell i think because she's a 
[00:08:00]  silent film star that has her hair down that's probably like full you know frontal nudity let me  tell you something speaking of hair you know in those early days not a clue as to what to do  hey so uh you just know the silent film stars oh my god that's why charlie chaplin kept the edges  of his mustache cut off so it wouldn't get all entangled that's why you don't hear much about 
[00:08:30]  crabs these days why nowhere nowhere for him to hide nowhere to live yeah they'll be standing there  like people in a parking lot right you can run but you can't hide right so anyway this guy the talkies  come about and they're like ah just throw him back on the screen now we get to hear him you know  talk yeah his voice was so horrendous and they were hinting that it was a bit broadway-ish oh it  destroyed his career just like that he went from the biggest thing to like a complete nobody and then 
[00:09:00]  of course he died of either morphine or alcohol poisoning morphine right wasn't rudy valentino was it  no no no it was a uh someone i never heard of to be honest with you yeah and i made this point  you know they they're trying to make this like connection that genius tragic death and i'm like  no we all will die of something tragic tragic that's just how it's gonna be yeah what are you  gonna do maybe way less than one percent of us get the the nice out we get the nice out but the rest 
[00:09:30]  of us ain't happening uh let's say how to psycho bob in baltimore psycho bob hey oak uh that silent  film star you were talking about yeah his name was rudolph carlisi punching out  oh oh not even 10 after there's a steve is gay joke  ah nice rudolph carlisi uh the book a lot of people are asking it's something like heroin and 
[00:10:00]  genius or something like that it's all right i mean i'm it's it's whatever it gets monotonous we get  it yeah we get it these writers like to drink there's so many writers in this book  and they all dropped dead of alcoholism well they didn't know any better back then  all right anyway the obama thing huh the rah-rah the rah-rah speech ah the big rah-rah speech this  wasn't a state of the union address or anything this was just him trying to like rally the troops 
[00:10:30]  yeah because you had said uh even yesterday and a few days prior you had said obama hasn't come  forward and really given everybody that assurance that everything's going to be okay he's been telling  us how bad things are and i think america needed to hear well but we're going to get through this  and he he didn't say that until last night it was his opening statement the beginning of it was like  a happy days episode where everybody came on the screen it was like hey cunningham where yeah yeah 
[00:11:00]  hey cunningham where's potty he has to start over again the the applause breaks  were ridiculous and now yes i'm biased i do not like this president but i have seen other presidents  giving speeches it's the same state of the union addresses are different  no regular speeches like this the the applause breaks that he was getting  far outweighed any other i've ever seen i would like to know because there's probably stats on it 
[00:11:30]  they were record-setting length who do you applause who do you blame for that i blame uh uh the uh  people that are just loving this guy again partly sire partly anything out of his mouth has to get  he introduced his wife and that got an applause break that jackie onassis wouldn't have got i guarantee  there's this footage of clinton introducing hillary and the same exact thing happened  this is one of those rah-rah nights dude they were clapping for him like he was the messiah but they 
[00:12:00]  were taking the cue from nancy pelosi tell her to sit her effing ass down and stop uh you know  getting everyone to applaud she's supposed to grab her gavel and keep order she she's useless that  one the best part was when it was like the best part when everyone was clapping and standing  they showed the crowd and you you realized only half the room was standing even though obama's  really trying hard to get everyone to work together though and god bless him for trying 
[00:12:30]  but it ain't happening it ain't gonna happen because these guys are are power hungry maniacs that  have elections to win in uh 2010 yeah they're not gonna put their own interests aside to work  together with uh the democrats a couple guys will a few guys will that's what obama's doing what  he's doing the same thing he wants uh the democrats to win the uh 2010 uh 10 elections  so he's uh it's keeping everyone scared frightened about the economy yes there is fear to be had 
[00:13:00]  in the market but uh you won't see him back off on it we've been out leading economists uh give  timelines on right when the recession should be over when we should be set for recovery blah blah blah  but uh i think obama wants to keep people like hey you need me in here you need the democrats to  back me up you want a fun fact all right we got a fun fact coming in from chris in michigan chris  yes the uh 52 minute speech last night had 61 applause break 61 applause all right listen that's 
[00:13:30]  impossible no it really isn't that's that's one less than one minute yeah thank you one on average  on it wow because sometimes there were three a minute i think wow is that true chris where'd you  read that all right we'll have to take his word for it secretive it was no sound i was at the  comedy show and the bar was you didn't miss anything no i know keith robinson and arty 
[00:14:00]  for koala getting very riled up great really we didn't care for it at all  yeah i watched it and um well he made a brave kennedy type statement last night anyone catch that  i wish it was well yeah oh boy i'm not saying anything is that we could go to the moon which  kennedy and do those other things yeah was it glub glub you want to forget this bitch in the car  you want do you want people to go to the moon and stay there is that what you're getting at i say that 
[00:14:30]  by the end of the card we should put a man on the moon and do those other things he said that was  he said last night with stars he said last night that he wants to cure cancer by uh the end of our  lifetimes my friend yeah yeah i heard that by the end of our lifetimes which will all be from cancer  oh he's a miracle man he walks on water he can uh cure the sick opie is he talking about stem cells  how are we going to cure cancer in our lifetime we can knock it down a couple notches i'm thinking 
[00:15:00]  he um cancer always finds a way though that was a bold statement it was right yeah it was  bless you dan stem cells probably stem cells yeah i'm sure that's that was his big mission statement  last night we're gonna we're gonna cure cancer by the end of the decad no the end of our lifetime  wow jesus who's gonna friggin back him up on that one if it doesn't happen  you're gonna call him out yeah we'll be dead yeah he'll be dead that's the end of our lifetime  plus whoever's complaining is technically not at the end of their life anyway so how do they know 
[00:15:30]  he's wrong that's a dumb statement it's a win-win for him by the time you die well thanks vote for  me all right after the break uh we knock down his 52 minutes speech to two minutes for you that's what  we do on this show ah we got uh three quick highlights get out older jibba jabba we got a  really hot story a 16 year old uh girl accused of running a prostitution ring my god could you just  say that again hot teen news do we have our hot teen news news bed wow can we bring that up that's hot

[00:18:00]  into the highlights i watched that you don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that  our economy is in crisis because you live it every day was this bed underneath as he was saying  wake up with and of course sleepless nights it's the job you thought you'd retire from but now have  lost oh boy the impact of this recession is real oh boy and it is everywhere oh no but while our  economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken though we are living through difficult and uncertain 
[00:18:30]  times yes tonight i want every american to know this we will rebuild we will recover and the united  states of america will emerge stronger than before obama president nah he's gonna solve it  we will rebuild well now the president said and um and what was that uh which movie 
[00:19:00]  no no impact uh deep impact deep impact yes yeah yes we will rebuild every president tells us it's  gonna be okay and then we're gonna solve everything and if it is red and that's it  everyone recognizes that years of bad decision making and a global recession have pushed our  automakers to the brink i like how he pawned it off we should not and will not protect them from their  own bad practices but we are committed to the goal of a retooled reimagined auto industry that can compete 
[00:19:30]  and win millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it and i believe the nation  that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it france who invented the automobile it was some  frenchy i think some frog did it with the internal combustion engine but then we took it and made it  well henry ford pretty much perfected the assembly line which made uh automobiles available to the 
[00:20:00]  masses right but as far as inventing the automobile uh sorry that isn't an american thing so what are  they gonna do run around holding an engine one car at a time i know it looks silly yeah wheels on an  engine french are bums you know and i know it i was reading uh about the bicycle last night and a  european yeah came up with the first bicycle but they were stupid and came up with the big wheel  concept one big wheel and one smaller wheel and it was really hard to freaking ride and then guess  what hard to ride it holding a big gas we took that and made it into what it is today my friend 
[00:20:30]  yeah we we steal people's ideas and make them better that's right so what americans do i'm not a fan of  the rah-rah speech all you have to do is uh say hey everything's gonna be okay we're gonna do this  with uh we're gonna solve cancer we're gonna make the uh the uh the auto industry healthier health care  for everybody kids go to school blah blah blah there blah blah but how are we gonna get all  this done how the futures look did uh did his speech have an impact on uh how the market's gonna open  today i think the market is up very well because someone is saying that the recession might be over 
[00:21:00]  my friend i bought a little city bank uh at the start of the day yesterday did you yeah i was uh i'm  fiddling around with a lot of stocks i'm buying i'm trading i'm day trading uh-huh and uh what do the  futures look like well the overall market spiked yesterday uh four percent for the nasdaq and 3.3  for the uh dow but today the futures are down ah i see they popped on bernacki's comments yesterday  but yeah i can say the recession is over or just about over he says it'll end by the end of uh 
[00:21:30]  this year but then it'll take us most of 2010 to get back into uh full-on mode so halfway through  obama's presidency probably i mean things will really but that was a uh that was his comment that  obama has a speech and the futures are down thanks that's good we'll see what happens later  on this morning right and then finally this i know there are some in this chamber and watching at  home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work and i understand that skepticism here in  washington we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and 
[00:22:00]  wasteful spending and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right  and that's why i've asked vice president biden to lead a tough unprecedented oversight effort  because nobody messes with joe  no one messes with joe huh what's the over under on uh joe biden what do you mean i say he's not 
[00:22:30]  the vice president within two years why because he's a loose cannon he's gonna say or do something  stupid you think obama's gonna heave his ass out i think obama's gonna have no choices not even  be one of those like uh gray areas i know this is with joe i think i think uh biden has uh the  potential to punch someone in the face would be funny to see wouldn't it  somebody gives him some flack and he just pops up somebody's one of the press mark my word over 
[00:23:00]  under two years i say within two years he's out i love i love watching these speeches when it's all  you know who the democrats are because they're standing and the republicans are sitting and  when bush for eight years yeah democrats sat there and sucked their thumbs while the republicans rooted  in rod bunch of phonies and the democrats they really rub it in they stand up they applaud and  they'll look into the other side like come on join us what's wrong with you i'd just be sticking  whoopee cushions under them when they sit back down it would sound like a fart they'd look silly 
[00:23:30]  so there you go the rah-rah speech on there that would be great they have no fun over there yeah  drop a stink bomb yeah things drop in high school pu no that's just joe biden yeah no one messes  with joe i bet you he's got some gas up there you think someone let one loose with all those old  white men oh you just know that chamber sometimes it's like oh dude but you think like last night  they just don't want to acknowledge that someone let a real stinker go pelosi pelosi she let one 
[00:24:00]  loose and biden's uh the first row of his plugs fell out what is uh what happened if there's a  problem to the vice president he has to go who how do you get another one i don't i don't know how  that works well you look at we're gonna find out nixon agnew if you look at that agnew retired  due to tax controversy wink wink and uh gerald ford was then put in appointed by i believe nixon yeah  he was appointed he wasn't like elevated from never elected so obama could just pick his own vice 
[00:24:30]  president uh yeah if if you know biden uh retired uh retired or uh you know left resigned um but  yeah yeah gerald ford was the only president that was never elected right he wasn't not elected to  vice presidency or anything just kind of skated right through that's scary tripped over his uh  tenure that's pretty scary but is the appointment like a supreme court thing where everybody has to  kind of sit down and okay no screaming at me sorry i'm just a boy just a boy there's got to be some 
[00:25:00]  credential there's got to be something criteria i mean yeah what was ford there has to be something  he's got to be um a senator well he's got to make the qualifications so that it should anything happen  to the president he can be president and i do believe there is some vetting done age and uh  ford was uh was uh from michigan had been in office from michigan representing the state of michigan  before this and then nixon just i want jerald ford a lot of people agree he's not a jew a lot of 
[00:25:30]  people agreeing on this and feedback joe will so have a meltdown uh what's what's this turkish uh  sully all about it you were telling us well apparently or hinted about it there's a plane bound for old  amsterdam i believe in amsterdam yeah and uh crash landed broke into three pieces this plane uh-oh three  pieces no one's dead what no one died he landed on water no this is a land land uh crash landing 
[00:26:00]  did he make the runway no get out of here it's the crap out of sully doesn't it wait a minute where  did he put this plane down in three places apparently the amsterdam airport apparently oh he didn't make  the airport just not the runway yeah yeah wow look at that picture we'll put that up on on a radio  actually it was on some island um that is very strange island the plane broke apart uh we get to  watch their hijinks and shenanigans every week on a show called lost which is on this evening

[00:29:30]  got it you're the guy who no one likes we right got it the rebel with a nickname for everyone yeah  exactly all right freckles yeah freckles hey hey there are no good legs why do they have some good  nicknames fat pig and no good legs i'm in kevorkian that's what you should call this  so you don't like lost jimmy i i actually loved it yeah i still like lost you though  yeah this beginning of this i have to re-watch the first episode i can't be bothered with lost 
[00:30:00]  it's a great show i mean it's like yeah it was brilliant the backstories were brilliant i just think  that they got a little crazy because they didn't know what they were doing when you have something  that big and you don't expect it to go by where it went all of a sudden it's like all right we get  the biggest hit on television uh now what apparently they say they have the whole damn storyline figured  out and out from beginning to end uh they know what's going to happen they have to say that what  are they going to say that they have no idea what's going on they're probably in a room right now 
[00:30:30]  panicking going what are we going to write well because things that happened in episode one  have to tie up and tie into things that are like in episodes now right so it's very difficult to do  that unless you kind of have a plan of what's going on like the giant three-fingered statue that  only made it into that one or two episodes and then abc got creeped out by it remember that when  they're in the on the water and there's a giant uh oh it had like uh four toes oh four toes four  toes well if you notice sawyer as he was walking through the woods uh did nail his foot with a very 
[00:31:00]  sharp implement and was like ah and then pulled it out of his toe could it be that sawyer is the  statue uh after something happens with this perhaps it gets infected he loses a toe and it's actually  a statue of sawyer because he does something as he's traveling through time that makes him  you know the man no that's not what happens at all he just probably has a band-aid and then uh 
[00:31:30]  hurley does something mysterious and then saeed kills eight people that's what happens  i was i love jimmy's synopsis i was an assassin for two years in the iraqi army and all of a sudden  i get the whole world by the balls shut up you don't snap i can't believe you've turned just because  of time travel like this mysterious smoke monster just didn't take you out of the show but  a little bit of time travel the smoke monster you're right i forgot exactly where's the smoke  monster he's there you have one of the others episodes i've only missed this season i've only 
[00:32:00]  i will watch it there's seven of them and just get through them are there seven yeah okay i mean  look i love the show the first they know where they're going brilliant yeah well they know the  now they do maybe but they did that's what they're telling you guys matthew fox uh jack is the only  cast member that knows how it ends why does he know the creators told him why would they just tell  him why would they just tell him that's what he said in an interview i bet i bet they lied yeah  if i told everyone that if i was on that show that's what i would say too look i'm you know i 
[00:32:30]  was at a party they got drunk they told me and then you'd be the guy but they knew where they were  going from the first episode yeah i know what happens to matthew fox runs with a machine gun and  just mows everybody down and then no answers are ever told it's like the end yeah then ben's just  driving the island all over midtown new york turn on a giant wheel oh well the island's going away  what where's penny in the boat you can move the island sure can yes yes nonsense stupid through 
[00:33:00]  time and sawyer's like what did you see that and then the the 80 year old interracial couple pops  out bernard and rose yeah bernard's yelling one black character one black character where are you  i hate bernard and rose not for obvious reasons yeah i just don't think they add anything to the  story they're ugly that's why i hate them yes they shouldn't be on the show how about pretty people  seal and heidi klum i wouldn't mind banging on the island i don't need to see bernard and fat used to  have cancer rose went through australia she's fine now well the island does have certain healing 
[00:33:30]  properties as we saw with lock who was crippled yeah and uh it can walk fine now although every episode  he's getting another leg injury yeah he really is falling apart he's stabbed shot my legs and vincent  the dog is still there he was in an episode ah i was wondering i was wondering how about walt's uh  38 year old son which is by the way why they had to write the i'm guessing that's why they had to  write who was the black dude in the first it was walt right yeah yeah no mike michael is the first i'm 
[00:34:00]  sorry i apologize michael walt's the kid i had to write him out of the first season because the kid  probably grows with kids they get too big so all of a sudden you can't make it look like three months  when the kids all of a sudden has a growth spurt a bunch of kids parents are fuming they'd probably  make him sleep with like a metal t-square on his head and feet so he didn't grow clamp a big clamp  stop growing meal ticket that's fantastic wow i have no desire to see this show no now i can't wait to 
[00:34:30]  see tonight's episode based on jimmy's like i just want to see everything jimmy said come through i hate  the new people i want to see ben steering the island down exactly he's got one arm propped up  on a tree stump the other one's steering the island right through time square there he goes  lost yeah he's taking the tumbling letters he's got a beep a beep a coconut when it went slow  oh it's a hatch with numbers what's in the hatch i know it was in the hatch a machine that kept

[00:36:00]  them all down trying to get through the dharma initiative all right we get the doctor what  what you get it what what is it tell me too much the first season was great i mean it was brilliant  the backstories even in season two i guess they were good but but the thing is they've they've taken  the initial characters and really done very good job of giving them backstories and front stories  making you yes making you appreciate the characters and care for them whatever uh they do in the 
[00:36:30]  story like that but then you got to bring in some new blood who i don't care about at all that  dumbbell and the broad with the red hair enough white people on the island god i mean honestly god  i'm tired of whitey on the island it's called paradise yeah it's true utopia but killed all the  black people they really yes they really did they killed mr echo yeah who i liked he was great and  michael exactly michael michael they had to get rid of uh because again i hated walt after a while  walt where are you walt enough who cares about his kid why'd they kidnap walt yeah why'd the others 
[00:37:00]  just take a boy because special and they needed uh michael to you know chase him down they are looking  for a replacement for walt they have been searching for a walt look-alike for three years they can't  find it and that stupid actor is is like the adult is dying he was on last season yeah exactly they  needed like a gary coleman type kid that never grows up yeah they'll just go season after season

[00:38:30]  like i've said as is everybody it is one of the most talked about shows uh there aren't many shows  like that you got to be really proud to be on a such a successful show did you see the potential  for this did you know you were going to be on the show any part of that ben character in in you  it's very difficult  interesting character

[00:40:00]  with the plane uh it crashed i don't know was it geese maybe more birds it was a big plot was it pot  i don't know what happened i i i obviously they came up a little short yeah somehow so uh we'll have to  get the details on that one but i don't know what turkish sully looks like slum dog pilot details are 
[00:40:30]  still popping out there were like 135 people on the plane and so far they have said no one has died  but they had trouble getting everyone because the field that it landed and broke apart in had just been  plowed so it was all real bad muddy turf but that may have helped the plane too oh yeah it might  have given a little cushioning wow that's pretty good all right see you later uh sully we got a new  hero yep we'll learn more later on today we got our bosch huh tar i learned plane  all right we got a uh a horny dentist what we got a again a topless joint and we got uh 16 year olds 
[00:41:00]  doing some prostitution stuff well which one you want first oh gee that's a tough decision well  what you want to finish strong so it might be a tough decision i mean the obvious choice would  go with the 16 year old uh prostitution thing but maybe we work up to that you were the kid that ate  all your peas before the peach cobbler absolutely that lovely you saved the goodness for last sitting 
[00:41:30]  there yeah and and instead of digging in you you ruin everything by filling up on vegetables  and and then and then you don't enjoy the goodness that is a peach cobbler well you should use peach  cobbler that's great all right let's eat our dessert delicious let's go with our dessert the 16 year  old whore ring all right we're gonna eat our dessert first police say instead of going to school to 
[00:42:00]  attend classes the accused teen madams were attending school to grow their prostitution  operation alie rasmus is here to tell us how they did it alie well phoenix police say these two girls  did all of their recruiting at local area high schools now police wouldn't say which high schools  but according to investigators these girls were able to convince several classmates to join their  operation jasmine finley and tatiana ty are both 16 year old high school students and they're both 
[00:42:30]  accused of masterminding a mini prostitution ring were the 16 year old girls that were arrested  were they running this business and the answer is yes they were police say ty and finley recruited  trained and collected money from five other girls all between the ages of 14 to 17 and that their  operation brought in several hundred dollars a night these two 16 year old girls in fact for a time  had their own apartment that they rented in central phoenix which was used exclusively for acts of  prostitution they look like 30 year old women oh god teen news this room this rooms at florida evans 
[00:43:00]  patrice if he was in demolition man  very good the one girl has chopped meat hair oh god totally ruined it we're running it so yeah well  well great you gotta leave it to the imagination i guess maybe maybe the one is recruiting we're good  you still want to eat your peach cobbler first day it ain't no peach cobbler hell no that's asparagus 
[00:43:30]  i want a peach cobbler i got some uh shoo fly pie how long i got some lima beans how long has bookman  from good times been running a prostitution ring she is horrendous shirley empel that is awful why do you  have to show us the picture i had mine because you guys were talking about how delicious peach cobbler  was i was like wow they're gonna be we all had an image in our heads man i was i was what was your  image mine was extremely white obviously some yes some girl that maybe looked like um sharapova 
[00:44:00]  or kornikova yeah you know that type of look yeah um yeah russian girls like bossing innocent girls  around and recruiting them into prostitution my image was uh half dutch half korean really you thought  it was gonna be a little exotic a little exotic as an asian oh yeah uh yeah that would have been  a good one too dylan and eric were sexier teenagers in these two broads they're awful they really  they're horrendous they are horrid yeah there you go i put a picture she does look a little like um 
[00:44:30]  as we remember the beloved buckwheat from sure the our gang uh series a little bit a little yes  i think i think imus would have a comment or two about these two uh yeah not uh these days but uh  and i think you can officially say it too yeah yeah yeah yeah wow you know that completely accurate  well uh she is a hoe that's what i'm getting um that uh can't get a brush through that yeah yeah yeah 
[00:45:00]  you know what i mean how's your dog you got and then we got this when they weren't in that apartment  investigators say the girls would walk the area near 27th avenue and van buren rosa maria aguilera  lives near that area and she says she's not surprised by these arrests there's just always  a lot of young girls walking out um as soon as it starts getting dark you know and there's there's  just a lot of you notice a lot of young girls walking the streets around here we asked her how 
[00:45:30]  young maybe like about 13 14 years old they're very young and they're they just walk up and down  from here maybe to like um 35th avenue just up and down here around here it's not surprising to  see them out here like that at all now even though the two girls who were arrested are minors they are  facing some pretty serious adult-like charges between the two of them they face 10 counts of child  prostitution and at least two counts of receiving the earnings of a prostitute  ah so they was pimping yo it was big pimping not all black people look alike i'm not that is 
[00:46:00]  horrendous who's the guy no you're just trying to find black people it's keenan thompson from  goodberg there's not even a resemblance you put the hair on him and i think we got a match  no no not even close who does she she looks more like anthony edwards at one point she's a  not attractive girl at all oh god all right well that was no peach cobbler we got we got two to go  we got uh that was gravel cobbler we got a horny dentist and we got uh we got a uh a topless joint 
[00:46:30]  where you want to go next all right uh well i guess we'll go topless joint all right it's always  fun well that's an update by the way i had a story we brought you guys a while ago i threw my cobbler  away after one bite yeah i took a bite and was like this isn't good and now i'm going for a new  dessert that was peach tumor i got a problem with this thing here this uh they almost were all in here

[00:48:00]  and the bare-chested waiter stood nearby why why no there should be two and two right why  why it's like the hooters guy the guy that insists he has to work at hooters i'll be honest dude that  is honestly because they probably want to get chicks in the chicks will go anyway because chicks are not  as homophobic as guys right but they want to have something probably for girls or gay dudes to look  at yeah i mean that's probably just a business decision did somebody uh record uh caroline uh

[00:49:30]  allowing this to happen sometimes they can't do anything go and support it just go to the coffee  shop see some boobage said our dumb interns out they'll be back four hours later with our coffee  that would be nice they would never get that done in new york though right that'd be a rough one  you know what these you could walk in there kind of give a glance then look into her eyes  get your coffee and leave but how many ghoulish creeps do you think are just going in there  and staring making stupid comments yeah like they're gonna get her you know maybe the truckers

[00:53:30]  california yeah california dentist says groping he got caught groping right oh boy was part of  treatment oh okay well let him go he's he's fine here's an explanation treatment is that the guy lost  his mind he saw a woman sitting in his chair anesthetized and went to town on her with her  with her boobs just going up and down heaving breasts stretching the bra oh he just had to get in 
[00:54:00]  her thing in her mouth making those sounds he went to the dentist with that blouse  i guess if you're you know backed into a corner why not it was part of the treatment part of the  treatment vigorous chest massage what was he doing do you know how busted you are as a dentist  where you say breast grabbing is a part of the treatment do you know how desperate on a list of  explanations that's that's probably the 50th best you could have how many experts and teachers at  dental schools uh professors other dentists do you think they paraded in to say that there is 
[00:54:30]  no such treatment as fondling you know it's just well let's read a little bit here right the attorney  for a woodland dentist told jurors that his client massaged women's chest as part of a medical treatment  defense attorney michael rothschild told the six man six woman whatever uh that mark anderson was  treating his female clients for oh wow stunt brain i hand this to you what tempo romandibular 
[00:55:00]  disorder you know what that is oh yeah all right what is that do you know what that is  yeah yeah it's probably the man doesn't know the mandible which is your jawbone yeah right  and uh yeah it's almost like a cmj isn't that what tmj what is it lock jaw or something  yeah they got like pain in the jaw i had some girl that uh a girlfriend years ago in high school 
[00:55:30]  that said she had that but i i'm convinced it was just an excuse so she wouldn't have to do something  to me she said she couldn't open her mouth wide i swear yeah maybe because of because of uh  because of you and your gift maybe she had to unhinge your jaw like a python  no she just she had a small little mouth yeah it was very hard for her to open her jaw she was  complaining that there was clicking going on oh really she would open her jaw and you know 
[00:56:00]  took a good punch in it though so what was he uh how does he say that that helped tmj that he  would beside the breast and when they scream help it would loosen the jaw muscle like what is he doing  the attorney says the condition affects the muscles of the upper body so now now that is silly  anderson faces guess how many felony charges how many how many felonies 19 felony charges for skin  to skin contact skin to skin contact there's no reason for it why do you have to take off the top 
[00:56:30]  to you know get the skin to skin contact can't you get a little massage through the clothes his  attorney's last ditch effort the jaw bones connected to the phone no and one misdemeanor for touching a  patient's breast over her clothing ah so he got 19 under the clothing and one over the clothing  the incidents uh occur between february 2005 and his arrest in august 2007 
[00:57:00]  14 women were involved how does that happen after one 14 14 came in with this condition i've been on  this earth a while rare condition i was gonna say i haven't run into one uh woman with this uh this  that would need this problem this guy has run into 14 of them 14 came into the office saying uh what's  the treatment doc and and what don't you think he would inform them of the treatment right he waits  so they're knocked out and yeah knocked out say what i'm gonna do now you got this tmj right i have 
[00:57:30]  this new uh groundbreaking treatment uh it's the muscles see in your upper body so what i'm gonna do now  now this might sound a little unorthodox but there's nothing sexual about it i'm gonna have to  massage your chest in order to relax the muscles that go to your jaw let me show you a chart of  the muscles and how they go from the blah blah blah i want to touch your exactly there's no way to  explain that and make it sound reasonable it's just if this is just as reasonable is if you were 
[00:58:00]  arrested for punching a girl in the face and they said why'd you do that you said well i was giving  a mammogram yeah exactly all right you're free to go uh a couple things coming off the instant feedback  we got uh david from florida cafe risque we dare to bear only 20 miles yeah these are famous billboards  when you're on the highway and then the owner is in a battle over his billboards for this cafe risque  because it was all about just counting down the miles until you got to see uh some boobs and get a 
[00:58:30]  nice omelet and then fast freddy from uh jamaica station march topless donuts in portland maine  it's all the throwaway uh chicks with crooked tees awesome we got a physical therapist on the line  about the horny dentist frank in jersey frank yeah man if he could get away with that me as a physical  therapist i could be getting away with a hell of a lot more yeah oh my god that is absolutely  ridiculous it's her jaw it's her teeth it's by her ear hey young people's tech muscles 
[00:59:00]  wait a minute by her ear yeah oh her ear hey god bless the guy for trying but i think uh i think  he's gonna lose this one punch out yeah yeah all right my favorite dentist story and it's very tragic  because you know this person has a family but it was uh i think it was somewhere down in chinatown  the guy messed up with the uh with the gas killed her and didn't know what to do so he just kind of 
[00:59:30]  put her outside on the sidewalk yeah can you get that story and i hope i hope the family's not  listening because but i mean as far as comedy goes my god he put her next to a parked car like it hit  her right quit improv like he he just got he went into panic mode and that was the best he could come  up with ah get rid of her just put her out on the curb get rid of the body is that the first thing  you'd think yeah probably thinking he's gonna still keep his job and everything right everything 
[01:00:00]  will be fine all right we'll find that story for after the break and uh we got other things to do  certainly there she is my nemesis carolyn mccarthy just because some douche bag i drove uh or it took  the long island railroad and shot your uh husband she's got an all-out crusade to take away everybody's  guns i don't look yeah screw her she's one person she's not reasonable she's doing this out of  complete emotion okay sorry i'm sorry your husband got uh blasted by some lunatic animal that uh decided 
[01:00:30]  he was gonna uh go into the long island railroad because he hated white people and shoot uh white  people but at least with her yeah it's coming from a place of having lost somebody as opposed to a  politician it shouldn't come from a place of losing somebody she's taking a personal tragedy and now  uh affecting your your second amendment right go screw off carolyn mccarthy respect for her though  than somebody who's just thinking for other people i got more respect for somebody not respect for me 
[01:01:00]  arm everyone i respect her i don't like her but i respect her more because at least her husband got  shot and she has a reason to say what she said and her son right oh yeah uh she got injured i think  her son is really very injured he's an old widower just trying to get some guns off the street well  you know so no no no not trying to get some guns off the street she wants to have a lot of criminals  just an old widower if she was doing that with her grandkids and just wants to get a few guns off the  street no no she wants some of the most uh strict gun control laws and uh we've all seen how that 
[01:01:30]  works you weren't allowed to own a gun in chicago washington dc some of the highest murder rates in  the country from those places so you tell me that gun control works shut it well that would have helped  her husband if yeah oh yeah yeah because uh colin ferguson this animal yeah had a gun it would have been  got a gun because he went to a gun store filled out all the necessary paperwork showed his loony  asylum papers and they handed him a gun right he didn't buy that illegally and carry it illegally 
[01:02:00]  and then use it to shoot people stop it oh shoot take away assault weapons why because something's got  a goddamn uh attachment for a bayonet on it was the last time people killed in a bayonet charge  uh during a robbery oh it's got a bayonet yeah you could have fixed a bayonet on that it's an  assault weapon shut up it's just an old lady gotta do some good it's got a flash suppressor on the  front what does that do well it looks cool look she's just trying to get something done you know 
[01:02:30]  go screw your old bag she's got a little cause yeah nice dress nice outfit on oh stop it she's  got a look at her green leave her not saying patty's day leave her in her little cause alone oh her  little little cause it's yeah abolishing the second amendment isn't a little cause she's just trying  to do some good with her life get some guns off the street guns off the street if that was all she  was trying i'm all for trading guns in for like movie tickets and stuff i think that works right 
[01:03:00]  how about it uh eighteen thousand dollar per bullet tax that uh you know why are you yelling at her  look she's got a turkey neck she's getting up there in years how can you make fun of this woman look  at her she's suffered enough because she's irish i understand she's suffered enough anthony she hasn't  suffered enough she's trying to make everybody else suffer legal uh law-abiding gun owners  she's just trying to making suffer she's just trying to make something of her it wasn't a  registered gun perhaps if there was a registered gun owner with a carry permit on that train her  husband would still be alive because uh it could have taken out that that animal colin ferguson 
[01:03:30]  but no she wants to legislate against people that are legally buying uh uh guns uh to try to curb crime  it works very well look in every big city where you're not even allowed to have guns and you tell me  that a strict gun control works stop it carolyn mccarthy my ass steven s from bashar writes i hear  she also wants to ban home theaters so uh yes you might be in trouble there anthony no bigger than two  feet wide 
[01:04:00]  why did they vote for her she's not a poll why did they even vote her in doll because they felt sorry for  her they felt sorry for her it was a feel-good story on the news after uh her husband was killed  and her son was uh wounded in a tragic shooting of course i'm not going to be a total dick and say  you know it wasn't tragic this this this animal how many people gets on a train and just looked at  people in the face and started shooting them uh but she got the sympathy vote because it was one of 
[01:04:30]  these wow and now here's a woman who's really going to do something about it she's running for office  and she won well that that gun was legal uh you know somewhere yeah absolutely yeah it was legal  somewhere and then colin ferguson got a hold of it there you go right jimmy trace colin ferguson's  gun tell me where it came from right jimmy or it didn't come from a gun store i'm sure they didn't  do an fbi check on colin ferguson before he bought his gun she's not trying to get the guns off the 
[01:05:00]  taking away the second amendment my favorite is doing my favorite thing when it comes to politicians  like say uh some dude dies right i think it happened to what uh uh sunny there right  bono bono sonny bono uh that was illegal guns yes few illegal guns there that toll booth and then  all of a sudden like the wife gets to continue his job how does that work that doesn't work  anywhere else in society that had to have just worked that's insane the oldie time maybe if you 
[01:05:30]  own a coffee shop and your husband drops dead of a heart attack then yeah i you can handle maybe uh  continuing the coffee shop or in a few cups of joe for people but how is it that your husband dies he  was a politician and then now it's your job yeah do they vote right crazy no they just take over they  just take over like there's no rule against that till the next election that's scary but how is that  some brain do a little research where how did how did that come about where a wife could get the  dude's job when he dies i want my politicians to have some kind of it was probably some like 
[01:06:00]  the 1805 law that was called anything but a negro  well obama president nah they were very racist back then we're very much more progressive these  days we yes we as a nation oh i'd lump us all in as a nation we we yeah 52 percent of the population 
[01:06:30]  could i think you should rail against obama at 9 30 oh i think that you should that one uh  yeah yeah let's see i bet i wonder if fitty is for or against gun control why don't you ask him  about obama there's a guy that's been shot a few times and then i want to hear you agree with  everything i'm sure he likes obama but you know what he said he would have voted for bush at one  point did he really yeah after the u.s came out and blasted bush yeah that may have been a a terrorism  thing though you might not be a lot of these guys surprise you politically they're not like where 
[01:07:00]  you think they're you know what yeah the guy's making money hand over fist right as i may say hand  over fist uh he's uh the more money you get i think the more republican and conservative you wind up  getting because you want to hold on to some of your cash uh anthony hollywood you got some choices  here that's true you got some choices uh 13 year old jc and my history teacher says second amendment  is not your right oh really tony on long island this woman has not you're right about tired of 
[01:07:30]  ant and his rah-rah gun stuff shut it mike mike and a lot of people want to know why you canceled  your poughkeepsie show jimmy explained yesterday he's doing jay leno so he had to move his date  i'm doing leno the 16th so the 14th 15th i'm going to be around doing uh six minute spots to  warm up for that gig mike's upset because his gun is taped behind a toilet at a restaurant oh nice  13 year old jc what's up what does your history teacher say about the second amendment sir  hey boys well she uh she says it really isn't our right because it actually says a well-organized 
[01:08:00]  militia and i support guns i'm playing devil's advocate don't yell at me i'm just saying i would  never yell at you he supports guns at 13 what a course what a cute little kid that uh yeah that's  been debated that's the way the gun control uh lunatics have have tried to get people to say that  it's not our right uh well-organized militia you know what a militia was back in the day  the people it was the people with the gun in their house so they could defend against uh enemies 
[01:08:30]  was it a mess hold on i have a question though now i have to my question is this all right if  you're going to say since it was back in the day like a militia was back in the day how come gun  control people are nuts when they look at back in the day the type of weapons they had like a lot  of times people say well the weaponry is now different how come it's not okay for gun control  people to go well the idea of a militia is now different so how come uh you try don't drive a  model t technology technology goes ahead and uh things are legislated and and uh you're not allowed 
[01:09:00]  to own a full automatic machine gun uh you know they they do make limitations on you wouldn't the nra  let you know if they had left to them they'd probably all oh yeah well you're you're able to  probably if you have certain types of uh uh firearms license you're able to own fully automatic machine  guns um in certain states certainly not new york but it's it that militia thing is just uh 
[01:09:30]  it doesn't it doesn't take away from the fact that it says you shall not be infringed upon and it was  not about owning guns that were muskets or whatever it was about owning guns so you could keep the  government honest right and if you read the early founding fathers writings that's what it's about it's  not about forming a militia it's about keeping the government on its toes so that we would never  have a king yes yes we've kind of moved beyond that though it no no we certainly have one now 
[01:10:00]  really haven't oh yes but i have the update on carolyn mccarthy and how she came into office she um  actually wrote her she campaigned for this seat it wasn't her husband's seat no no i know that she she  didn't like step in as a uh a wife of a husband that was in office she i knew that she ran for office and  won on the sympathy vote right you know she was like oh well it just reminded me of you know wives  that become politicians because their husband uh passes uh 13 year old jc when are you going to 
[01:10:30]  college by the way are you going to be one of those one of those kids going to college early  no probably not i can actually graduate out of eighth grade he's just a waste i love it all right  thank you sir school's a waste uh by the way uh this is what i'm going to do mike mike mike if you  can wait through the break we'll go to you next if not i understand all right because we're late  all right all right stay there uh rich voss is here so let's get the dr seuss books out pass them  around and dumb down the show next with rich voss robert kelly too and 50 cents a little 
[01:11:00]  little later this morning 50 50 cent i call him curtis oh do you oh so do i then but you don't  trouble it's his name opian anthony gotta get right back into this opian anthony jim norton rich  voss joining the program and mike sat through the break so let's see what uh mike has to say to  anthony all right hello mike hey what's going on guys hey hey actually now that rich voss is going  to be reading uh dr seuss i'd like anthony to bury the back of a gun in my forehead 
[01:11:30]  um yeah what's uh what seems to be the issue uh mike i don't know it just seems like we get this  gratuitous rant every other month or so with this and this gun this when it all goes down when it all  goes down what's going down when is it happening i understand when it all goes down i'm saying that uh  they really are trying to um undermine our second amendment right the democrats the gun control uh 
[01:12:00]  uh people and uh uh it's it's uh it's one of our rights as an american that's all i'm saying  it's not going to be happening though this takes so long it's never going to happen yeah never going  to happen believe me they're trying they're trying on a daily basis it's already legislation up in new  york that they want to uh do all kinds of uh things with the ammunition and uh amount of guns you could  buy actually want to consider a uh automatic handgun a machine gun actually want to consider that yeah 
[01:12:30]  that's why it's not going to happen because the really important things they don't act on they  don't work on the important things all right it's run out of steam that's it nothing's going down that's  not going down and i've been in the worst areas around and i'm by far not the most imposing person  and people that don't carry guns are the people that don't get shot from the most part people that 
[01:13:00]  don't carry guns are the people that don't get shot yeah it's usually the people that carry them that  take some lead yeah really you're talking about criminals right  you're talking you're not talking about a law-abiding citizen with a gun  is more apt to be shot than a uh uh just the person walking down the street  yeah it's on me you know it's there yeah you're ready you're ready to pull you don't just walk out 
[01:13:30]  that's not a little chain or a necklace that you throw on in the morning i'm not talking about i'm  not talking about uh well of course somebody's getting shot if someone has a gun and and they're  in danger someone's gonna get shot just the fact that it's on you i love that someone's more apt to  get shot if they have a gun well yeah just for the fact that it's on you and you got it you know  about it you're not reaching for your so that if you're if your life is then threatened you have a 
[01:14:00]  way of defending yourself is what you're saying well maybe what i'm really saying is that you  really should put a put yourself in a better position not to get shot like what like how  you don't go to places or don't get into situations where you're likely to get shot  i don't go to places or put myself in situations but there are things called home invasions there are  carjackings there are innocent people that are menaced by criminals with illegal guns um on a daily 
[01:14:30]  basis and and murdered by uh the same why can't a law-abiding citizen that's been put through  background checks buys a legal gun carry it with him to defend himself against the animals that uh  have these anyway i don't know i mean this is one i don't know well mike why don't we put your words  up on the blackboard for everyone to enjoy i don't know and when did you get up so obsessed 
[01:15:00]  with guns by the way i don't remember you uh being so rah-rah over the years the threat comes  down thanks mike we're gonna move on i appreciate it take away our second amendment right then i started  really getting into the the movement i joined the national rifle association um are they do i agree  with everything that the nra says no of course not uh but they are a very strong gun lobby they've done a 
[01:15:30]  lot of work keeping some of these friggin liberal asses at bay and uh i do contribute uh money to them  on occasion and uh i think they're if you're a gun owner you you should definitely join i think it's a  good thing to do it it shows uh it shows uh that that there are responsible gun owners out there  that uh don't want uh their rights taken away just the other day they sent a nice little mailer out  uh made it easy it went to uh your local congressman and senators and all you had to do is fill it out 
[01:16:00]  and mail it in like those fcc complaints that people don't never heard the show and you just got to sign  it and send it out yeah exactly what it was and but it said it had a questionnaire on it do you agree  with this and this and this so you didn't just have to buy their entire uh catalog of opinions uh on on  the matter but you you know you pick and choose and then you sign it and send it off and i i did that  as a responsible gun owner that wants to preserve our rights i saw someone gave you a holster brochure 
[01:16:30]  at the fh yes they did indeed and it was very nice and it backfired or something you were telling me  it was sam's little ploy to be a douche oh really yeah you know how we like pawning off pain in the ass  listeners on each other oh it's a little game we play people see we play it with you uh the listener  when you're a pain in the ass and you come up and start yapping and jibber jabbering about some  inane crap we never want to hear we will usually pawn you off on another person from the show 
[01:17:00]  uh in a very creative subtle way that makes it seem like we appreciate what you're saying so much  that someone else would really enjoy this conversation or that they would relate to it even more right  then we walk away did with norton what's that i heard you then we walk away pointing at the uh  other our friend from the show behind the back of the listener and laughing at them because now 
[01:17:30]  they're stuck with this um babbling idiot right sam uh ran into a gentleman who started talking to  sam and asked what kind of holster anthony uses and uh sam i guess thought this was a great opportunity  to pawn one of these listeners off on me it's just not true oh no no i was talking to this guy and he  was like hey i'd really like to talk to anthony and i was like well we've had such a good conversation  anthony's an approachable guy we'll just go over and talk to him and he was like do you know what 
[01:18:00]  kind of holster he has and i was like that would be a great opportunity for you guys to talk something  you have in common a bastard so you you found the guy that was interesting and probably had something  to bring to the table yeah he's very intriguing personality and i said as much as i'm enjoying  this conversation anthony's he's a conversationalist for a living he's gonna love this guy well this guy  comes over and starts talking he's talking about uh holsters hold on i'm looking at a pumpkin  oh oh god and i need intelligence wise oh rich popped his teeth out oh my god it just came out i hope 
[01:18:30]  what a 50s bodyguard does the same thing with his knuckles thinks you're a beaver attacking 50s yeah  we got to talk about that yeah we will in a sec but this uh so this guy comes over and uh sam of  course introduces us and and gives a little chuckle to me behind this gentleman's back thinking i'm  going to be saddled with some uh boring conversation well this guy's johnny on the spot very prepared  has a a magazine or a catalog chuck full of holsters and uh i thumbed through it very high quality nice 
[01:19:00]  leather holsters and uh he gave me his card the catalog and said if there's anything i need  you know give him a call it was something that i could use what when is a guy with holsters a fun  guy to talk to at a party well when you are a gun owner put in your pocket put in your pocket what  what am i that guy who shot himself in the leg sticking it down the front of his class your 
[01:19:30]  burst yeah you don't put the gun in your pocket you put it in your back right here under your hat  what makes what makes a holster goes there though what makes a good holster though they all look the  same no they don't it's a form-fitting holster that fits the exact gun that you're carrying  so you can't use it you can't just throw any gun in the holster it's it's form fit to the gun itself  so it fits tight it's actually like a friction fit that way there's no snap over the top of it for 
[01:20:00]  the most part unless it's a bigger caliber weapon but uh there's no snap over the top so you don't  have to unsnap it and pull the gun out it just stays right in there very nicely very um subdued very  flat uh contours to the body for a carry it's just uh they were very good uh very good holsters  i don't i know santus was uh the name i don't think your obsession with guns has anything to do with  the fact that the government is is trying to ban them i think whether the government would be banning 
[01:20:30]  them or not banning you would still go out and buy a bunch of guns and be obsessed with them because  i mean the government's cutting back on like school arts and stuff i don't see you holding pottery  classes anywhere i don't care about school arts but but even guns so you're obsessed why is my  tax money going to school arts get some macaroni and glue it to a plate that's what i did  exactly a bunch of little fags  excellent point yes you want art you got five fingers now you got a turkey yeah gobble gobble 
[01:21:00]  sissy art isn't a right yes it is no it isn't you cannot take away the arts out of school didn't  you ever see the show fame i mean listen you cannot take it out i'm telling you absolutely and  and i mean without creativity what are these kids just going to be computer geeks i am a defender of  the second amendment that is what i do i use this forum occasionally very rarely i might speak  occasionally on my interest for uh people's right to bear arms very rarely you'll barely ever hear 
[01:21:30]  hey don't play that phony phone sound over me pally do the bitch do the bitch so where you at  with it off my soapbox where you at with the gun thing uh i personally uh would like to get a gun  what happened was i applied for a we'd love you to get one too i miss thank you for a toothbrush  i thought uh i uh i knew a joke was coming because his eyes popped open here what uh i applied for 
[01:22:00]  when i was 18 i was busted with pot just a couple of and they said it was going to be expunged from  my record you know oh all right so i applied for the gun you didn't read the thing that said even  expunged sealed well you have any type of crime i had to get a lawyer and i didn't get a lawyer to  expunge i didn't realize it and when i filled out the application even if it was expunged by the  way you would still have to write it down yes learn that word and wants to use it today what 
[01:22:30]  expunge yes no no for many years you thought you had expunges under the sink  so why are you chewing gum if you have fake teeth that pop out so easily listen you know  what the problem is gum out i uh i quit smoking almost three years attaboy rich because you guys  last week 23 years last one is 23 all right get him a drink get him a drink uh but i heard no no  it's uh on me i heard you can get a rifle without a permit you can just go buy a rifle not in new 
[01:23:00]  york city no in jersey right i don't know jersey law i know new york state law you can just walk in  they will do an fbi check on you i don't mind and uh yeah if you have a proof of a residency in  new york city or new state of new york you can buy a rifle so i i think i'm gonna get a couple  shotguns or whatever shotguns fun sure only because when it all breaks down and you know right right  yeah yeah when things happen and yeah i got one of those big ass nice jew pistols that desert eagle 
[01:23:30]  wow the big snub nose jews know how to make a five pound gun i love your people when it comes to  making that way is that what the israelis use i don't know what they use it for batting people over  the head because that gun is giant and uh uh unnecessary completely unnecessary as a sidearm  yeah that's it because uh like american jews will just annoy you to death but in israel  they actually haven't done that business over there from from jerusalem to gaza yes a pistol 
[01:24:00]  why don't we take a break we got to catch up anyway uh rich you're helping us out on friday right  you're doing the funniest listener uh thing for us i'm gonna host uh host the event yeah that's very  cool at comics this friday we're all going oh that'll be and i're gonna be judges you're gonna  be uh the master of ceremonies and as we try to find the funniest listener and i'm gonna show  this friday and basically there's gonna be an area where i'll be standing and you can come over and  perhaps touch me and say hello but it must be brief it's called the rest area

[02:22:00]  my headphones turn these up perfect time for what is it our guests to show up by the way  the guy's taking a shit there bobby thought that would be better than i hope he shit his cell phone  by accident right so you know what we just get out of this little room and go to the strip club  you're trying i'm trying yeah come on you can't get through this level you suck trying to get out 
[02:22:30]  bring him right in what are you waiting he's standing out there what's going on holy shit  what did everyone lose their brains today what's up what's going on y'all are dead early in the  morning man oh it sucks believe me look at me like why i'm so energetic it's no uh it's no treat to  wake up early no not at all we're checking out the the video game it looks great man it looks great  this looks so goddamn how do you get out of this we're trying to get out of this room so we can get  into the strip club and he's just running he's just shooting himself and shooting through the bars 
[02:23:00]  and not getting out we just want to go in the strip club and check out the  yeah we want to check out the broads and the strip club eyes i'm still finding myself around  the game too do you play video games yeah i do my son is a fanatic right now i mean i guess it's  where i was at at that age i was 12 you know i was crazy that's when it was you know one joystick  one button yeah right the old atari game i took some influences from games that i enjoyed back then  and incorporated in actual games so there's a point where you acquire more than you can actually 
[02:23:30]  carrying the object is for you to run like the game outrun uh-huh so i added that but of course  it's different because of the environment it's like humvees and helicopters and different things  that you can use with that so people don't give you shit like you know oh you're running around  the streets with guns well you know well i don't care yeah good i honestly don't know thank god  somebody doesn't care you know i mean because they'll no matter what you do they'll figure out a  way i got it i got it i got it it's no good you know what i'm saying it's like the whole 
[02:24:00]  rating mature of actual video games like i didn't create that genre that was that long before i came  you know what i mean so to create this is what i would be actually entertained by so i created  something that i that's actually relevant to me then trying to create something that is pg-13 like  it's already filmed it just amazes me that there are people though that will try to just take their  their uh uh ethics and and morality and then try to pour it on you and stuff and take the games and 
[02:24:30]  movies and and music away from everybody because they have a problem with what they're listening to  i mean there's nothing there's no terminology used in the actual game that isn't used in a film  yeah yeah already filmed so you gotta we gotta eliminate cable television then we gotta turn up the  computers because all of these things are being said on the web that's it just play children's  programming all the time and that'll save the world apparently was there things that you wanted to do  in the game that they said no was anything you suggested they go like oh no we can't put that  in a room it's sold you know what i learned i learned to let the people who actually do it take 
[02:25:00]  the lead yeah like i walked into the room because bulletproof i had so much input that the game  didn't come out as good as it could have and i said this time i came in and i was like yo hold on a second  i'm gonna listen what is the best possible things that we can actually do yeah and i kind of let the  guys do what they do and then i added my input to it like the environment is the way it is because  like two years ago when when i first i started with vivendi universal and then they merged with  activision and i now with thq but when we actually when i went inside with them i had an opportunity to um 
[02:25:30]  see blood diamond yeah yeah and then and to see uh i went to perform for the soldiers in iraq  so i kind of took both of those things that's what inspired me to be a part of the film project  home of the brave it was myself samuel jackson jessica bill i had a great director on that project  it was um uh erwin winkler you know and um from from that like that's what because this is the most 
[02:26:00]  intense situation you could possibly be in like when you've been through some some tough periods in  your life you can feel like you've been through it until you get there and you realize that they  made a conscious decision to be in a life-threatening situation and that's got to be mentally a lot  tougher than what is out there like you don't make choices somebody just runs up on you in the street  were you scared of being over there i went over there we did shows in uh at the end of 2003 yeah  and then they started beheading people and i i wouldn't know it's crazy i was scared to go back over  the first thing you said to me is look i'm not gonna bullshit you you can die today 
[02:26:30]  so i got the car i was like what the fuck did i come here for you know what i'm saying like what  like i could have went to dubai that was my day like time off then i said let me go do that with  the soldiers you know what i'm saying and i come here you're gonna tell me you're not gonna bullshit  me you could die today you know but it's interesting i know the people that i saw there weren't the  same people their loved ones miss here because i'm your spirit would absolutely have to change to  have that much depth around you if you come into the platoon of 45 people and then now it's 30 
[02:27:00]  and then it's 26 yeah there's a lot of guys you know and then it's 20 so then those guys are  writing deaf notes like if i actually pass away send this note wow to my family and you know because  they see people moving yeah around them now putting a strip club in iraq that was definitely a stretch  you had to get one out it can't be that i absolutely needed that for motivation i mean like what is your  motivation i said what is my motivation man are you able in this because like in in gta i mean this has  got it's got the same level of graphics uh as grand theft auto as far as a believability and the 
[02:27:30]  shooting is great because when someone gets shot in this the blood actually splashes behind and  sprays the wall um are you able to shoot civilians in this too because in gta you could just shoot  anything that walks yeah it's like like what's the name they got the same engine as uh gears of war  yeah it has gears of war yeah that's great oh you got into the club i got into the strip club but  they're not really showing that much pussy you know what is there a see can i ask a question though  because a lot of video games have secret codes where you can type in a xx is there a way you 
[02:28:00]  can fucking eat some pussy if you type in a secret code you just stick you stick your fucking nine  millimeter to the chick's asshole i think about that next time next game there's probably one where  you just fucking snap your fingers and you just shoot pussy just shoot your load all over pussy  you remember to tomb raider used to have it a code that you could punch it in and get laura croft  completely you could see your titties which is fantastic the graphics weren't that great back  it doesn't matter let me tell you something there's something about video games yeah you 
[02:28:30]  ever play online with uh and a girl comes on and she's like hey guys i immediately get a hard on  you know chris hansen comes to your house yeah i can creep it doesn't oh it doesn't matter  she's got to be no hot chick is playing video games with a bunch of fucking nerds online well there's  one i'll tell you there's one girl that was from australia she used to she was playing all the time  the war game yeah and uh i'm such a creep i used to when we'd be in this big battle everybody be  fighting online i'd make her meet me in like the hut in the back of the map and just you know you can 
[02:29:00]  make a character squat down even though it was a fucking another soldier go i'd make a squat down  and go back and forth and talk dirty to me  sometimes when i'm playing tiger woods golf there'll be like a lady in the gallery  that's all i got what are you doing i gotta ask you about you you're definitely involved in the  business end of a lot of uh what's out there yeah you know is marketed as 50 cent you know as as you 
[02:29:30]  uh did do you have to tread a fine line between keeping your credibility uh with especially your  original fans and being a businessman you know well for me i this is my personal growth  like as i get into different things but you got to take some shit from people i'm sure it's like  you got people that's gonna hate you for whatever you do you know i mean and then they're not even  being conscious of the actual business right see the guy who was in hip-hop 10 years ago if he had  the same morals and the things that they consider street would give you street credibility and 
[02:30:00]  everything he's all he's completely broke right now yeah it's a vh1 special you know what i mean  yeah you watch that hammer special man oh that hurts yeah like it's crazy because he didn't  understand brand extension when the the business is changing and the marketing dollars are changed  so if the company can't see the same returns off the cd sales which we know obviously isn't the same  they can't spend the same marketing dollars they could on presenting you to the public as a star 
[02:30:30]  but who turned you on a vitamin water like who would think to get into that and what a payday you  know initially vinyl water for me it's so basic man like i went in the walmart the no frills section  like they had toilet paper for 29 cents i was like yo how much is this cost to make it's gotta be like  nothing yeah it has to be nine selling it for 29 cents right you know and then i'm like i just want  to take three of these put it in a wrapper with a different brand and move it to the middle of the 
[02:31:00]  and sell it for 50 cents you know what i'm saying holy crap that's all i want to do all your dad you  know what i'm saying so when you're looking at that like and initially look at spring water you  got poland spring in the same section for like 289 and then you got 59 the same gallon of water  for 59 cent and they say this is spring water too yeah what's the difference i don't know the  difference me i'm like they're both spring waters there's two different things it's just which brand  are you going to actually pay for so i'm saying like i wanted to actually go into i just wanted 
[02:31:30]  to move the spring water from 59 cent to a dollar you know what i'm saying like there had to be a  bigger profit margin if i could just take 59 cent more off of what they already have and they got  their profit that profit point selling that 59 cent if i could just move it into the middle and then  spend marketing dollars to brand it and he's thinking all this shit when the store manager's following  him around the store saying herb and bot exactly herb and bot so then i explored the possibilities 
[02:32:00]  the vitamin water thing i came across in in in uh los angeles in the gym working out and you know i  was looking for a supplement for soda and then i mean they had flavor i had so much water that it just  like i felt like i wasn't after a while you'd be looking like i don't want that i want soda i want  sugar sure you know and then that was the thing that i had in between all the water that i had while i was  training and then you know i did the research it was a private owned company based in queens and 
[02:32:30]  there was providing stock options for their employees to create incentive for them because  it was private owned and then they allowed me when i came in i bought equity from individuals  because people who go to work live in the now they say well if i sell this i can move between you can  have his own room and we can get a new car now and you know they spend the money before they actually  get the money once they know someone's willing to buy it and then you know how did you get educated 
[02:33:00]  uh as far as the business end goes because there aren't many people that are that you know streetwise  and also i mean you've been in the shit earlier in your days we've all heard the stories when did  that happen where you you know now you're talking fucking like stock options and it's a lot of new  information coming at the same time but if you if you've always actually wanted those opportunities  and didn't have the finances or generate the interest that allow you to be involved in those  deals when the opportunities come you absorb it and you learn like right new york city is a million 
[02:33:30]  when the night time comes on every light is representation of a great idea that has no  finances to support it yeah you see what i'm saying that again because i'm completely lost i said  tonight when the night when the sun goes down every light new york city is representation of a great  idea that doesn't have finances to support it so a lot of people have good ideas they just don't  have the finances or the energy around them to make someone else come in and actually support so 
[02:34:00]  there's you know there's a chance you're taking obviously a chance with your with your uh backing  with the money yeah uh but then you got to make kind of an educated choice uh if you want to invest  in something the vitamin water was a great idea that's not just off at the city the public just sees me  but they don't see my attorneys they're a team of people that i send to do due diligence on the  companies that i associate myself with i'd love to see them because mine fucking stink they got me  involved in the stock market five months ago it's a great time i just want to get yeah get an 
[02:34:30]  attorney he bobby bobby uh turned me on uh yesterday actually he's been talking about this is 50.com  actually there's patrice turned me out to it just to give him credit patrice on the other  turn me on to your your website that's a ning website right yeah it's your own community yeah  you know instead of myspace you joined 50 space right jesus christ i mean it's doing great too like  i mean it's an opportunity recently i turned it from i'm turning it into like a network when things  happen weekly like they they wait for pimping curly then the following week it's a new episode like 
[02:35:00]  because rick ross like i get i don't get anything out of going back and forth with the artists they're  having established themselves as a creditable artist to begin with but i feel like if i don't  compete with artists that challenge me that i'm feeling like i'm above the actual culture well can  we tell what people with the rick ross thing is too because there's like a conflict with another  rapper and you bobby turned me on what you did was what everybody would want to do right the guy was i  guess what was he just shit talking you for nothing yeah he just came pretty much because the album's 
[02:35:30]  gonna come he looked for additional publicity by you know saying different things and then he called  me curly and when you call me curly it's like you know like mo larry and curly call me curly i said  well the f would do that i'm gonna turn i'm gonna i created this character don't call me shimp  you know and then i started creating these webisodes that happen every other like every week  and it's generating millions and millions of hits but you really you're really embarrassing him  because this guy came out and it was uh i guess you started something so what you do is uh you you come 
[02:36:00]  on you go i'm gonna fuck up your life and uh this is really unpleasant to hear but the seriousness  where you went you know what uh nobody tells i have no bosses and uh i've decided you you actually  made a decision to do it to fuck up you said i'm gonna fuck your life because i'm saying to you right  now i have 90 of my project completed only reason why it's not 100 completed is because i have to wait 
[02:36:30]  for dre to be complete what he's doing with em in detroit before i can have him to focus on  everything else to mix the last few pieces of my actual album so em's album i end up coming out first  now because he'll be done by the time i get my hands on dre right so i make good music away from  him but when me and dre are together it's something organically it happens that i want to see happen on  this project so i'll wait i'll be patient so while you do that this guy decides to jump out there the  time that i have idle time i'm gonna fuck you up i'm gonna sit there and figure out how to fuck your 
[02:37:00]  life up now you got time to give it a little thought you said i have disposable cash to fuck another human  being life up that's just crazy like i mean you picked the wrong time bad bad time so if you had  if you had stuff to do you'd be like ah you'd let it go yeah i mean but i tapped him and just kept it  moving but now i'm gonna beat his ass jimmy get into what he did it's not it's amazing it's the stuff  you'd want to do because immediately you think like all right there's two rappers going at it one 
[02:37:30]  there's gonna be a problem yeah this is just embarrassing shit he takes the guy's ex-girlfriend the  the mother of the guy's mom flies her in and takes her and her girlfriend out on a shopping spree  yeah he wasn't doing it he wasn't doing it somebody gotta do it yeah but you know you had her you  interviewed her like a talk show yeah you see me very serious you was so see it was like a regular  talk it was like charlie rose he was so serious he would ask her a question and then he would look 
[02:38:00]  right into the camera and just let her answer about him not paying child support his jewelry  his jewelry is rented yeah he he loves this guy's a joke i mean he's seen before to the highest level  like i've seen a lot of guys to the highest level like this guy's the biggest fraud we've seen thus  far like if you go if you go from it like you the guy is a correctional officer and he writes from  the perspective of the biggest drug dealer in miami now we know miami is a port yeah it comes 
[02:38:30]  through there and we know how to you know people like the way they love scarface his infatuation  with that guy him he done created this new character actually the guy named it he took rick ross freeway  rick he gets out next month 18 years you know he's gonna be knocking on his door  and you're a correctional officer and you decide to stop working corrections in order to go rap 
[02:39:00]  as if you're the biggest drug dealer in miami but you had a photo of him you you had a photo of him  when he got his diploma as a corrections officer shaking this white this old white woman's hand  and he's got the biggest shit-eating grin like i did it mom i did it mom but he doesn't he doesn't  fit in his outfit either yeah it's amazing i mean didn't i have to know to say i don't dress good  i think i dress good no one in here is gonna argue why don't you worry he said i didn't dress good 
[02:39:30]  mr met all of these these high-end brands when we know that they got european cut  he can't fit none of that shit he gotta shop in big and tall  you know what i'm saying like hey he had a picture of his mom too that was yeah that was  he actually said he had a picture of him with his mom but it was one of those photos they were eating  they just were eating at a table and he's clumped  he goes look at he looks like a nutty professor 
[02:40:00]  can i ask you with all the attention you're giving him does that help him well it doesn't  you don't think it does because they always say you know even bad  yeah bad business is good when you not at a time when you actually your material isn't generating  right because i don't i didn't know the guy's name until today right so what happens is you're aware of  him so you're gonna notice his record sales are super low you understand because it's not enough  for you to go buy his record because you didn't hear a song that made you feel like you should be 
[02:40:30]  interested you sure he was talking to 50 so at the end of the day like the record sales come in and  they go wow so you you really suck you saw like 30 000 records get out of here now now with with  shit like this pulling stuff like that obviously you know especially from past events and things  that have happened yeah you gotta kind of be concerned that somebody's gonna snap and take a  shot at you you know ever since biggie and tupac had their issues it altered the entire art form 
[02:41:00]  yeah because hip-hop is is the competitive nature of the art form it always had battling as a part of  the culture you know what i'm saying and if you got someone that um isn't intelligent enough to  draw lines then we're in danger yeah you see what i'm saying like if you got people to cross those  actual those barriers in that spaces then you got issues but do you know people that you know you  could completely fuck with and and they won't they won't do anything and then do you know other 
[02:41:30]  people that's like me better yeah this guy will fucking this is the guy shot at me  you know i mean you've been you've been shot i mean it's it's you know you get to talk to many  people who have actually you know who for all intents and purposes shouldn't have made it and  you got shot more than once yeah and uh here you are you know and you do a hundred million dollars  with it's like do you ever look at your life and go like why the fuck did this happen or how  i know i'm crazy right because i know that i i convinced myself that these things were going 
[02:42:00]  to happen long before anything came to really pass so like my grandparents look at me like  okay we understand now but i was like i was absolutely crazy to them like i was but i got  shot i came back i lost my my record deal everything i'm not at columbia anymore and i'm by the radio  mumbling wait did columbia just pull your pull the deal because they just didn't talk to me anymore  okay like after that i got shot so i was like i'm by the radio mumbling but what i'm mumbling is 
[02:42:30]  get rich or die trying you see what i'm saying so much to my grandparents at that point while i'm  there it's like poor baby you know he had a shot at it he almost he has something you know but for me  i i can't i don't take no as an answer when you come from where i come from there ain't no plan b you  gotta make it you see what i'm saying so a lot of other people they'll they'll create the excuses  they'll create reasoning for why they're not supposed to make it in their lives because they 
[02:43:00]  don't have things like if you grew up in a household with one parent a single parent where  i'm from that happens so common that you can't use that as an excuse right right you know i mean  you can't you can't use minor things like that like i mean you lose a leg so what you get a chair  and go you know what i'm saying like you don't know i don't care the rest of the world doesn't  either you could just look at like everything that's happened in your past and say like that  brought you where you are now absolutely and educated you to bring you to where you are now 
[02:43:30]  so there's no there's no real looking back and regretting anything you know regrets at all no regrets  you know what i think i think the things you go to make you who you are and shape you as a person  so those experiences allowed me to become what i am now and i i look at you you know when you when  you when you say um where you're headed like i have no idea i'm going through a tunnel that doesn't  end my ambition is leading me so many different places that who knows where i'm gonna end up you  know what i mean when you're getting when something like that's happening and you're in the process and 
[02:44:00]  someone's shooting at you and it's hitting you what what are you thinking you're scared you just  you're gonna die maybe yeah you're gonna die like any other it's a life threatening situation  so i mean and anybody those things change you because either you become when you're hurt as bad  somebody halfway kill you it hurts you get shot nine times you're hurt bad your hip is fractured you  can't even sit in the chair straight so from there either your fear consumes you or you become a little  insensitive like someone who survives a plane crash you know what i'm saying you yeah i mean that those 
[02:44:30]  type of things happen and then you have to assess life and death even though we know it's our fate  all of us in this room we know we're gonna die at some point because humans are habit forming and we  look forward to the future we push that to the back of our minds and still concentrate on saving  money for tomorrow right you know i mean but in all reality we're gonna go all of us fuck tony robbins  you should put out a fucking self-help listen up motherfuckers hey as a businessman how's the 
[02:45:00]  portfolio did you get hit well like the rest of us everybody yeah i think everybody i mean i think  if you had enough your broker well no but i made adjustments you know what i'm saying move some  money around i mean if they tell you they didn't make if they didn't take any losses they didn't make  enough money yeah there you go right just like play pesci didn't casino i want that money back that i  invested we can't do that i'd like your background i'm gonna knock your fucking head  do you worry about uh you you trust everybody that's around you you keep an eye on your finances 
[02:45:30]  and shit like that was getting a lot smaller is it yeah yeah i'm just people that surround me  anyway because did you notice there were people that were just kind of you know you know what it is  is you you have you develop a comfort with people that you know you feel like you know but their  intentions change right because people every day they're not the same person i had my son's mom  over 13 years i woke up one day she decided we was enemies you know i mean that's like it's like  how many 53 percent of the people who get married get divorced right and i'm sure that there's one side 
[02:46:00]  of that party that really don't listen we don't have to get divorced do we you know i'm saying split  up half of everything i've earned at that point i'm sure that there would be a compromise on some levels  if they could just come to that you know to that actual medium but the other person is like no i'm  gonna go give me my my half and yeah that's it you know what i'm saying so i mean it's it creates a  phobia financially i think we condition ourselves without even being conscious of it like a little 
[02:46:30]  boy we're gonna give him a car the car is actually on the street right now so what does that car equate  to finances because you got to get the money to get the car that he's actually playing with if it's a  tyco truck then it's saying work because it's saying construction if it's has the same gas if  it's a fire truck it's saying be a fireman when you get older and then a little girl before she's  grows into being a little girl when she's still a baby we give her a baby  yeah we give her a house we give her a cooking set so we're teaching a nurturing and and actually 
[02:47:00]  groom the family at home these are traditions that we already have like when a woman should take  care to home and the man should you know be the breadwinner wow in different ways and you're not  even like a lot of people not even conscious of it but we do those things you uh we went to the  premiere of a righteous kill and uh we saw uh we were sitting actually in front of uh erwin winkler  so we saw you having a nice gentlemanly chat and i'm like i knew he was somebody i didn't know he  was i don't recognize him and uh but you got up and we you know just chit-chat with him and his wife 
[02:47:30]  and you know erwin winkler doesn't look like the type of guy that hangs out with 50 cents you know  picture them two in a car together um you did scenes with pacino and de niro together i mean uh  i mean you're not nervous rapping is you terrified doing that because my acting is shit i mean it's  a loaded experience definitely when you're with someone that's that great their choices have been  what we've been watching for like decades yeah i mean albert chino and robert de niro don't get no  better than that why do you think uh hip-hop uh artists translate so well into acting not all of them 
[02:48:00]  i've seen some shit but i mean like some of them some of us get develop a comfort that allows you  to be in front of the camera i'm in front of the camera so often looking right we here right now  you're taping me it don't matter yeah yeah you know i'm saying you just relax and be yourself in  front of in different ways but i mean acting is a whole nother thing it's the study of human behavior  when you watch other people and kind of take things from it makes you more observant even when i  watch a film i see it differently now because i see the shot i see how they shot the scene instead of  just watching the film before it would just be sit and look right right just watching it you know 
[02:48:30]  because i know that it took 45 minutes for them to go ahead and change the lights and they wouldn't  set the lines again from a different angle it was like you know so it changes the whole process  do you get tired of all the uh emphasis put on uh because i'm sure you know you and i flew together  one time i'm sure we took a flight together to cancun we sat next to each other uh and we just  chit-chatted about the fcc and then i got you know i just shame spiraled and ran out of things 
[02:49:00]  to say i feel like a fucking idiot um you were being very engaging sort of like now  no but i mean no but it was i was actually surprised he was so like you know soft-spoken  nice dude which do you remember him i don't remember that thank you you know what i do what i do is  i maintain uh a general respect for everybody regardless because you don't know how important  the person that you're talking to well in that case the person you're talking to is not particularly  important but no but what i'm saying is i don't know when i'm gonna run into him right or what  that person actually does he could be somebody that i need in the future that to help me move 
[02:49:30]  to the next level and if you don't show that courtesy and respect i've had the same situation  happen and the president of lionsgate was sitting across from me in the actual airplane and i and i um  didn't know he was the president of lionsgate till i got to that point where i'm meeting him  but i recognized him from the i said yo did you ever did we ride on a plane from new york to los  and he said yeah and i remember because he got a head full of white hair like his whole hair is like  white so he's one of those guys that you look at just recognize and go how the fuck did that happen 
[02:50:00]  so you were we were talking about the uh the fcc and how hard it was to get videos and stuff done  and you were saying that there was just there was all these problems that they were giving uh  hip-hop with content how tired are you to have to explain uh you understand like it's not your  responsibility or my responsibility to raise people's family for them and how frustrating is  that as a performer i think that you know they'll they'll ask up in different positions they'll ask 
[02:50:30]  the craziest questions they'll try to place the weirdest responsibilities on entertainment  you know i mean like the pro athlete because you know their kids want to be those pro athletes and  join them they create dress codes yeah now you got to wear a suit period you know what i'm saying but  a lot of these guys come from environments they come from not having so their tattoos read the same as  mine's when they get on a court you see things that reflect the same energy in the mentality that 
[02:51:00]  lives where i actually come from but they got to wear a suit because it's mandatory now it's gotta  be ridiculous i know you had a problem with the billboard with the uh with the guns in your hand  i guess yeah yeah when i was doing get richard yeah yeah and you know what it is is there's standards  that are completely acceptable in different art forms like if i mentioned 007 all right what do you  think of the logos the gun pointed at you yeah if you if you think of rambo what is the highlight in 
[02:51:30]  that what terminator all of these things the gun is the star of the actual film yeah you see what  i'm saying like so when you when you actually those things are acceptable in film to utilize for  marketing purposes when you think uh even wasn't it um what at the time it was uh angelina and and brad  was in the same movie and they had the guns out at the same time and nobody had an issue with that 
[02:52:00]  and the problem is they look at me and says no you don't understand he has that gun right now  you might i mean it's true you're certainly all wondering yeah well it's like spielberg went back  spielberg went back and took the guns he uh they uh they they put walkie-talkies in the  agent so they wouldn't have guns enough already silly how upset were you when uh mccain lost were you  upset about that how was it okay i mean but i'd like to look taxes to be low but yeah yeah that's 
[02:52:30]  my big beef i'm just like you know uh yeah i don't fall in that category of the people what's your  name heather oh your name david yes why y'all get the chance to sit way back there like that  they're just listeners huh don't be invited to see oh they're listeners they were sitting outside we  have people's uh no it's fine just trying to figure out like why they had to be so far back  over there because you know they we had list we have bleachers outside with some  huh they make a sit back yeah now we get a live audience every day i never did that before like 
[02:53:00]  with that color here every it grows that color everywhere yeah well it was at one point but now  oh as clean as a baby i understand i understand you prefer it like that i prefer it like that i  prefer nothing there you know but you know i never saw that before yeah that's gotta be you  know you know no well we got to get them out of the fiery red mane they all got their coats on  outside they're panicking yeah they want i enjoyed myself this definitely wasn't painful very cool 
[02:53:30]  very cool meeting you man what are we promoting of course the video game yeah the video game came  out last night blood on the sand yep so it's out in the stores now yep uh 50 cent dot com yeah this is  50.com y'all log on check me out and you also got a show on the platform it's uh it's it's on  i think eminem's uh channel which is shade 45 yes uh um which is uh serious 45 and uh here on xm  it's 66 and it's saturdays at 10 in the morning sundays at four o'clock in the afternoon and uh it's

[02:54:30]  all right we're gonna take a break open ethy thank you thanks man wow that was really cool  50 cent man he's great to listen to him all day long a motivational speaker a businessman a  rap artist but he's great because he doesn't shy away scary motherfucker still he doesn't shy away  from his his past he talks about which i like it's like yep when ludicrous was in um he was too  worried about all right we were trying to fuck with him and no i was worried about his image 
[02:55:00]  his new image he was trying to go hollywood it's like all right we get it yeah you're in a movie  but he talks about what he's doing and his music and getting shot it's like that's what you want  a person to do just be open conversation like he was saying you know he knows that where what what  he did brought him where he is so yeah he's willing to talk about it which is pretty cool because you  usually get people they fucking clam up or their their press people tell you don't talk about this this  this this i mean he and uh you know the guy's a business man he knows his shit and uh he only 
[02:55:30]  knows his shit about more importantly he made something of himself i was just saying that at  eight years old his mom was killed she was a drug dealer at 12 he started selling drugs  started boxing at 11 and rapping at 13 brought up by his grandparents and look at him he's  shot nine for hundreds of millions of dollars that guy hundreds of millions easy but he did admit  though i mean you have you can have all the ideas if you don't have the funds yeah and the people  around he said you know because a lot of guys are like yeah man i made a i did it i did it and you're 
[02:56:00]  like you feel like shit because it's like oh that guy did it all by himself this is a guy who said oh  look i have an idea now go call all these first he had to do it himself to kind of get the ball rolling  yeah right he didn't just start somewhere i'm a drug dealer can i have some lawyers and stuff and  you know the guy i'm talking about now maybe the drug money led to his first uh big deal well  now of course but you know now he's got enough capital to back up whatever he wants you're gonna  know math when you're a drug dealer you play dope wars yeah you gotta uh yeah you gotta know your 
[02:56:30]  numbers that water idea of his was just like he can't he didn't think of who we should have thought  of that yeah but he didn't think of the vitamin one he just invested in it they came up with a flavor  for him and he turned and he walked away with about a hundred million uh in some estimates get  the hell out from that hundred million dollars per bottle the company was sold for like four  per the company was sold for like four point something billion and he walked away with like  a hundred million their their estimate jesus yeah every wrong decision when he came up to me in 
[02:57:00]  the hallway and said i loved you on deck jam though it made my fucking day yeah sure he did  yeah shut up for real no he didn't say that why wouldn't he say that people wouldn't  i was there i wouldn't say that who could prove this huh who could prove this uh we had a lot of  people here seriously who could prove this are you lying to us no you are so fucking lying i can  see the lying boss face you do this yeah i'll do the boss thing i'm not lying no you you you lose 
[02:57:30]  emotion in your mouth when you're when you're lying my teeth are falling i'm losing i'm not i bet  if you really said that yeah what's the big deal he wouldn't remember he was five and watched def jam  exactly how long ago was that it was a while he's on video he might have saw it on video you  know people recognize you guys all over what's the big deal all the time he was on a plane with  the guy and he didn't fucking remember him that was only a little while ago gonna remember you  on that six years ago we've been together six years yeah are you feeling 80 no not at all  it's what he really said that yeah why who would make something like that okay so 50 recognized 
[02:58:00]  you but thank god russell simmons didn't i know nothing made me happier than when russell simmons  had no idea who he was i still will not believe that fitty uh knew i will he probably saw it on dvd  he's right what are you gonna scare me with your fart please little girl he just  please please i will all right now they're saying justify that with a fucking eye blink  now they're saying he made 450 to 500 million off that water water deal i that's insane the 
[02:58:30]  number i got in front of me was 100 million so yeah me too but a lot of people saying four to 500  million wow what i understand is that rapper that went after him the new guy like he's  he's an established obviously he's 57 why would some new come that's like an open mic  are going after you and they're going they're not going to stand a chance growing up in i'm  in the dumb radio world you go after the guys above you because then if those guys talk about  you usually that helps you if you have talent but what he was saying is north is a piece of 
[02:59:00]  shit he was saying that this guy's so fucking bad it doesn't matter that people now know who he is  did you just shush me yes because i'm trying to make i was trying to make a joke  well he's he made the point you didn't make but i'm just saying but it was important to what he  was saying though because a lot of times yeah if you talk about a newcomer you could actually really  help the guy if that person has talent but what he was saying i heard it loud and clear this guy  sucks it doesn't matter that everyone now knows who he is they will now look at him and go wow look 
[02:59:30]  he sold no fucking units he is a really good point he addressed that guy i don't know enough about  rap to know rick ross is good or he's terrible but i mean he addressed him the way you'd want a  powerful guy to address a guy who's way lower on the on the ladder which is to call him out and  address it he didn't hide like like these fucking faggot program directors and radio don't mention  the name uh whatever he didn't give a right uh he came right out he gave the guy blade the guy sucks 
[03:00:00]  he sucks you'll see that he sucks right and i respect that he flew his ex-wife in and took her out  not his ex-wife but his baby's mother he flew her in took her fur coat shopping uh  bought her fur coats he took a gucci bag because he can because he can but he actually he actually  said it in the first video he made he actually explained he was like look you're going to come  out you're going to get a little publicity right now but it's going to hurt you because you're going  to get it's going to all go downhill and you're going to be nobody in around six months this is 
[03:00:30]  going to hurt you more than it is but okay then he goes okay but if you want to do this i got some time  off he goes i have to go away for this weekend to drop some tracks with dre i'm coming back on  monday and uh i'm gonna fuck up your life because i have the money and uh i'm gonna then they start  showing off he had his lawyers go get documents about this guy's life about you know uh him and  he got the photos of him that's some hardcore shit dude he probably hired a pi i mean he had his 
[03:01:00]  lawyers his lawyers got all the stuff why doesn't somebody tell biden he's got dirt on his head  you know this ash wednesday thing is really um um uh you should be able to wash it off the  second they put it on it's like they put it on you go into the bathroom what's the reason to keep it  there i don't know it's gotta be a real they're all looking when i was in the mall once in there  because i'm a jew i didn't realize i was in the mall yeah are you and i saw this guy coming at me  with this big ash from far away i go oh look how horrible that mole is and then i saw his 
[03:01:30]  baron neville that he was right and then his sister i had the same one i'm going what are the  odds that two moles two moles in one right so so we did that uh to the what's his name the rap  guy there were you done oh with the yeah yeah he yeah he fucking he fucked him up dude he didn't  fuck he didn't but what he did was embarrassing yeah but i i almost like the fact that he didn't try  to fuck her like he didn't humiliate her like he didn't use her like i'm sure he probably could 
[03:02:00]  have but he didn't do that it was almost like that's yeah he just kind of showed him like you're  a little fucking whatever i can do what i can do it's almost like he's letting them know like you  know i could have fucked your ex-woman if i wanted to yeah that's the vibe i got but he didn't  i'm sure he could have if i went out please i'd fuck him he's got four hundred million dollars  who wouldn't the only thing i don't mean that the only thing we do would you be a cuckold and and  and service him out of respect just for his fame sure i know i wouldn't prep him i'd let him 
[03:02:30]  fuck my chick i wouldn't care i wouldn't prep him he'd destroy you would you rub cocoa butter on his  bullet wounds no i'm not a fucking hobo the only thing we didn't ask him about was that uh that  house that went up in flames on i thought of it we were we were going to try to ask him everything  but they started rushing us through the interview shit happens like he's probably doing a lot of  very suspicious uh out there on long island that's how it's part of one of it yeah one of his exes  was living there they said that i think she accused him of doing it because she said he didn't want 
[03:03:00]  her yeah maybe we could get the news story because she wouldn't move out actually told me an interesting  fact i don't know the exact details but the reason why he can't like this guy can't fly 50s ex baby  his baby's mama in and do the same thing is that he was paying her like five hundred thousand dollars  a year in uh alimony or child support whatever it was uh whatever it is and he then he took himself  to court and they they said okay you're gonna pay child support this is what it is but it was 
[03:03:30]  much lower than five hundred thousand dollars a year that he legally had to pay but he continues to  give her five hundred thousand dollars a year so if she fucks up he has papers that say all right  well there you go there's fucking twenty grand a year right fucking brilliant that's brilliant so  yeah fucking genius hardcore but if uh um well plus you know another reason that that wouldn't work  because they're not two guys it's not like what him and kanye west were arguing where they're both 
[03:04:00]  really rich really famous dudes this rick ross guy is just i mean he might even be a good rapper he's  just not as known he you can't afford if you're a 50s ex i don't care how much you like him or hate  him you don't fucking try to humiliate a guy making 400 million you can't do it for a guy who makes  x amount there's just no reason yeah unless you don't give a fuck does he call the videos officer  ricky on that site yeah the yeah officer ricky there's a oh he doesn't want to be an officer  anymore he's supposed to be this new character but the backdrop of his website is actually 
[03:04:30]  photos ricky videos check out the backdrop can you put that up i want to see this the wallpaper  on his website is photos of this guy accepting his uh his accommodation to be a fucking corrections  officer and him holding his ex-wife i'd imagine that's not good in the hip-hop community to be  dead no corrections i'm no kid i know i'm just uh he made this for uh for the show hey yo what's up  yo it's the kid 50 cent you're now listening to my pal that's what they told me to say you're

[03:20:30]  my whole body was prone to infection for eight months 
[03:21:00]  that would really blow though you have to watch a comic with a burned face  he's always wide staring at you his arm is always bent oh and his wrist is always crooked like a t-rex  trying that self-deprecating humor but just making the audience go i'll bring out the next guy  please i hope i'm just hoping for a girl comic to come out no offense to bonnie  unless she's burned that would be funny too no teasing of course  there was a comic that they used to do he was in a wheelchair or something you know i'm talking

[03:24:00]  right yeah to try to show the pink healthy skin  both of my nipples are burnt  one looks like one looks like a melted pyramid  that's a melted hershey's kiss on you  good one my fucking sunglasses take to my head  i'd use a coat hanger to keep my fucking sunglasses on  well you have to put the fucking monocle in like mr peanut because you have the same amount of hair 
[03:24:30]  with a hat your fucking your wig which is so obviously away from across the street  just just mold mold sunglass holders with silly putty on the side of your head  just hold them on like a jet black wig it looks like elliot gould's hair in the mid-seventies  it completely doesn't work for him  they never have straight hair wigs  burn victim's always got the curly-haired wigs  they always look like hats burn victim wigs should all have  fucking met logos on them  it's terrible bathing caps 
[03:25:00]  oh let's say yeah well talking about the wheelchair comic ryan in canada has something  ryan what's up hey that uh the guy in the wheelchair with cerebral palsy yeah  he's the funniest comedian out there he comes out he pulls himself out and he's uh he's like hello  everybody i am from colorado yeah when people ask me do you ski  and he fucking checks out his wheelchair he's like i told him i fucking snowboard you 
[03:25:30]  fuck the moron  don't create a noise  he drops the fucking joke a little better than i do  you like that guy huh he couldn't have told it worse yeah  he's uh he's really good he uh he goes into a fucking joke scene he starts throwing his arms  around he says uh he says uh i'm token and no one helps me but i accidentally proposed to a deaf  woman she's really nice but she never listens to me he's got the same holy

[03:26:30]  yeah that's your hope that's your hope in life that's my hope in life uh this guy anyhow he'll  do showcases like college showcases and you know how those things and when he's on stage you know  they come out they go crazy they love them you know sure and then he doesn't get one college  after it because he says uh people are too uncomfortable to have me but they're so politically  correct and they laugh and then yeah yeah there was a guy in boston but he wants to build a ramp  we used to run his own show and he brought me out there at this  shit redneck racist bar and he was in a wheelchair he used to write all his jokes on his legs because 
[03:27:00]  he couldn't feel them his legs had all the scrimshaw  last minute you're just carving jokes in your legs and the guy the owner of the bar was his  fucking just redneck boston fucking piece of shit and he's like he's shit face he goes all right we're  gonna start this fucking show uh i'm gonna bring out this guy he's in a fucking wheelchair you know  how it happened he was emptying a fish tank out of the window and it pulled him out and he 
[03:27:30]  fucking snapped his neck oh and then he looks at the guy goes why don't you just let go of the  fucking fish tank moron who books that club uh yeah oh and then he comes wheeling up for all the  laughs that they get we used to leave we used to forget about him at nick's comedy in boston it's like  two stories up and there's a big window we'd help me patrice and burr would always leave and go over  to dominic's get pizza after the show then we'd look up and we'd just see this dude in a wheelchair  fogging up the window because he has nobody to help him down the stairs oh holy jesus it's amazing

They're going, you know, everybody in the crowd's going, he's disabled.  He's just, let him talk.  Let him talk.  Just be patient, Bobby.  You know, everybody in their heads is like, just let him talk.  Oh, wait.  Okay, that's funny.  You understand?  I mean.  No, I know exactly what you're saying. 
[03:37:30]  I know.  Well, and I'm saying people are, I'm not, I'm saying the fact that, first of all.  I want to know what room he said he's going to fucking book you in.  What Canadian tour are you trying to work out?  There's no way he wants to be this night for no reason.  Where's he from?  Where's he from?  The guy said he's from Colorado.  So what club are you trying to get in?  None.  None.  I don't get, I get in one time.  There's an ulterior motive for here.  None whatsoever.  You never hear me attacking people.  Boss either hates you or loves you.  I don't attack.  It's either you can't give him something or he can give you something.  We're not attacking handicapped people. 
[03:38:00]  No, I mean a cop.  Fucking ramen noodle legs decision funny.  I'm not saying he's funny or not funny.  Callous knuckles.  Hey, listen, rough handshake.  Yeah.  Leave weightlifter gloves alone.  Oh, shit.  What?  What?  So you'll shut up, would you?  Just shut your fucking mouth and just tell us what he can do for you. 
[03:38:30]  Exactly.  No one can do it.  What's he going to do?  Leave broken, humble spine alone.  Oh, shit.  Not only is he.  I just know what it's like to grow up with a disability.  That's called, you're a retarded.  That's not a disability.  That's a choice, you fucking douche.  No, I have a speech impediment and it didn't get in my way.  You don't have a speech impediment.  Yes, I do.  I talk too fast.  No, I'm not.  Oh, really?  Dr. fucking Bob?  Oh, my ass.  Dr. Bob. 
[03:39:00]  Fucking head.  Don't call me Dr. Bob, dude.  What the fuck, dude?  That's taking it too far.  There's education.  I'm not a doctor and you call me one.  What the fuck, boss?  I'm sorry.  You're right.  You're 100% right.  Fucking Jew.  Jesus, why would you call me a Jew when I don't practice?  I'm sorry.  Dude, bite this coin without your teeth.  I want to see.  Tell me if it's real. 
[03:39:30]  That had to hurt when they filed that shit down, huh?  That doesn't hurt when they stuck the needles in the roof of my mouth.  I mean, when that wears off, right?  When the needle wore off?  Because you can't do drugs, right?  You couldn't take, like, a Valium or some shit, could you?  Yeah, I can't.  Oh, you're good?  I mean, what?  So now you can't go up on stage and go,  24 years without a drink and drunk in my body.  I'm not melting them down and shooting them, stupid.  Okay?  You're fucking prescribed.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you're amputating the leg?  No, I'll do it natural.  In the wheelchair, do some stand-up. 
[03:40:00]  Boss will drive you.  Oh, shit.  You're prescribed something.  Why would you be so nice?  There's no reason.  I know.  Because you came, you brought them up in a bad way.  I don't know.  And then as soon as we, as soon as we started trashing them, you switched it so you can  suck in your head.  No, listen to me.  They were trashing you.  I was, I was saying, I was defending you.  Listen, 40 foot man on killer theater.  This is why.  I'm sorry, what'd you say?  I didn't hear that.  I didn't, I didn't hear you.  40 foot man on killer theater. 
[03:40:30]  You heard it.  But listen, I wasn't trashing, I was trashing the people.  That fucking.  50 foot man.  Exactly.  It was 40.  And it was these Ghostbusters he was at the end of.  What did you say I was at the end of?  The end of what?  Midnight Run?  What fucking movie?  Midnight Run.  I didn't say Midnight Run.  What are you talking about?  I didn't say I'm running.  50 foot woman.  Why are you laying like that's a cock on your chest?  More comfortable.  That's how I feel.  I have a microphone.  If there's a cock on my chest, that's how I would treat it.  You lay the microphone on the chest.  I wasn't trashing him. 
[03:41:00]  I was trashing the people.  Exactly.  You won't trash.  You trash everybody.  Why won't you trash him?  I don't know him.  Dude, I never met him.  I said that.  You're the queen of mean.  What's wrong with trashing him?  Well, because he's another comic.  Why attack him?  He's not a bad comic.  I'm not.  I'm not attacking those odd things that hang below his waist.  Okay, but I'm not.  That fucking wind chimes.  There's a million other comics.  Yeah, we're just attacking old chum legs. 
[03:41:30]  Exactly.  What's wrong with fucking old mobile legs?  I'm not.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just not.  There's nothing wrong with shoes.  There's nothing wrong with pool float.  Pool float.  Yeah.  Is that weird?  He can do.  You don't know him?  Do you know him?  I've never met him in my life.  I swear to God.  What the fuck?  Why do you like him?  Because he's the top of the shoes are dirtier than the bottom of the arm from the rain.  I never said I liked him.  I just, one, I don't use the attack of the comics unless they're here and I don't like  him.  It's because his sneakers are always brand new. 
[03:42:00]  Is that why you like him?  I think that one was used a few times.  Wow.  Hey.  Sometimes.  You may pick up on that one.  I tried to enhance.  Yeah.  Anybody got any gum?  Howdy.  Howdy.  Howdy.  That's what happens when you're trying to think of your own line.  You don't even listen to anything.  No, I know.  He just said, what?  Huh?  Why do you defend him so much?  I didn't defend him so much.  I just said, you know what I'm saying.  You're like, this guy's the next comic.  You're like, he's on other comics. 
[03:42:30]  You're like, he's on other comics.  He's the best thing.  No, not unless they're here.  You never heard me show another comic unless they're here.  Really?  And I have an argument with him.  I don't think I have, no.  I don't think we can come up with a copy shit on him.  Yeah, a bunch of examples, right?  No, I don't think you can.  Liar, whore.  No.  I mean, I'd rather shit on audiences than comics.  You do.  I do.  Every ticket sold.  Charging them.  I don't fail on stage.  I know.  They don't know.  These fucking listeners don't know.  Josh, you're fucking hilarious.  Fucking 20 minutes out of your life, a day, a night. 
[03:43:00]  Exactly.  Blah, blah, blah.  What am I saying?  No one knows.  Oh, my fucking crest doesn't even know.  I have nothing against this guy.  I'm just kidding.  He'll annoy you.  Yeah, dude.  He doesn't annoy me at all.  He does.  You're defending him.  You're acting like you're a doctor.  I'm defending a handicapped person.  Making his prosthetic feet.  I'm not.  First.  Shut up with handicapped person.  Quiet.  All right.  That's the wrong.  Exactly.  The guy talks funny.  Yeah.  But he's fighting the odds like 50, dude.  Oh, that's what you want to hear.  That's what you want to hear when the emcee goes, here's a young man fighting the odds. 
[03:43:30]  He's fighting the odds.  He's got a...  He's getting ready to laugh at this guy.  He can get his new vitamins.  He doesn't want to hear that fighting the odds shit.  Do you know what would be funny?  Is if they had him up there with a starting block for a race and someone fired the starter pistol,  he'll go and he just fell face first on the floor while everybody lapped up and ran around in circles.  I like to see him just roll off the stage.  Yeah.  I'd like to aggressively position his feet pointing outwards while I scold him for being 
[03:44:00]  a burden.  I would, I would, while I'm talking to him like his mother, I would position his feet  like very angrily, pick them up and move them around on the chair.  Or I would take his shoes off and beat his dead feet.  I would beat the top of his dead feet across the fucking bridge of his dead fucking feet. 
[03:44:30]  Jesus Christ, man.  Holy shit.  What about those fucking things?  I was about to tap on him.  Jimmy's horrible.  I don't know.  Jimmy just...  Hey, those fucking, those giant toad acorns you got below the ankles are really bothering  me.  I think I'm going to break them.  I'm going to be in fucking Chicago this week.  Yeah.  At the improv.  Yeah, let's wrap up.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Play one of the listeners, though.  Play at least one.  That's right.  All right.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:45:00]  Sweet basil.  We did have a listener.  I thought that was one of our listeners.  Yeah, right.  Hey, I want to be a funny comedian.  I just found a nickel from fucking 1902.  You and your change.  Who cares?  That's worth from 1902.  They made it back then.  You know how much money this is worth?  That's why I wrote my first joke.  This is probably worth around 100 bucks.  Go on, man.  I swear to God.  It's, uh...  Oh, yeah, of course.  Look who grabbed this.  Come on, Voss.  That was actually a test.  I want to see a 1902 nickel. 
[03:45:30]  That's all.  That's 2005.  We're just kidding the fucking comedian, by the way.  I don't want to shit on another comedy.  Two years after I started comedy.  What did you say, Jimmy?  I don't want to shit on another comedy.  We're just kidding.  Yeah, I know.  We're just kidding.  But it's fucking...  We're just kidding.  Like fucking Don Rickles.  It's all right now.  It's all better now.  Take it easy.  Two hockey pucks.  I mean, your feet.  Look, Jimmy kids.  Because he loves...  I am joking. 
[03:46:00]  Jimmy just nailed Bobby again.  I fucking hate your asshole.  Would you like it better if he was in a chair all day?  Dude, your asshole is fucking...  His name is Rich Voss.  Your asshole.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It looks like a fucking...  It's just...  It's kind of gray and pink.  Oh, God damn.  What are you...  I can't take it. 
[03:46:30]  What?  Do you punch your asshole?  What?  It looks like a battered woman.  He can hold it open where he's gaping.  Ah, shit.  But it opens up like a fucking...  A dolphin hole.  A blowhole.  It just opens and then shuts.  A blowhole ass.  I farted at you.  Your asshole looks like the thing in Star Wars that attacked everybody in the sand.  I'm going to fucking throw Luke in his...  God, dude. 
[03:47:00]  You asshole.  And then that smell that comes out of it.  Actually, this one didn't stink.  He has the worst smelling fucking...  Something's dead inside you.  That's because of what he eats.  He eats like a fucking...  An alien.  He really is like a fucking...  You had Cool Whip?  I had...  Celery?  Fat-free Cool Whip and some celery.  What's wrong with that?  For what?  For breakfast.  For a banana.  No, not for breakfast.  For a snack.  I had already eaten...  It was a banana.  Egg whites?  I had eaten egg whites and a grapefruit.  Fucking banana.  What?  What?  Nothing.  I want a touch sweet.  It's something you could eat without those in, Nosferatu. 
[03:47:30]  Celery and Cool Whip?  He does like...  Nosferatu.  He looks like the original vampire was.  Yeah, yeah.  The black and white one?  Yeah, Nosferatu.  When he comes out of the fucking thing...  With the shadow?  Yeah.  Only Foss's fingers are a little too short for that.  Yeah.  Those big long nails.  None of it was a shadow.  You have fingers like a burn victim, you know?  What's his fire survival hands?  My hands and your lips were definitely a burn victim. 
[03:48:00]  That's fucking funny.  No, it wasn't.  That was pretty funny.  That was mean-spirited.  Yeah, you do.  You kind of have that face, too.  Yeah, I agree.  You do look like a fucked up clone.  Like Sigourney Weaver in the jars?  Yeah, like, you know, the clones that don't make it?  Yeah, yeah.  The ones that don't quite pan out?  Like mid-clone.  Just when the guy comes in and smashes them all to save the day.  Pulls the plug before it's cooked.  Yeah, then Jimmy falls out.  Oh, shit.  In a pile of his own goop.  That's very mean-spirited. 
[03:48:30]  It certainly is.  It really is going around the horn, isn't it?  I'm a fucking burn victim with no ears.  Exactly.  Voss has got little baby hands and fucked-up teeth.  And Jimmy looks like an unfinished clone.  You're a Daddy Warbucks bag of shit.  I hope your plane hits a mountain.  And I'll be in Chicago this week.  Oh, God. 
[03:49:00]  Very fun.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  Very fun show today.  I'm fucking coughing up phlegm from laughing.  Very good.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  That's the unfinished clone.  That's actually, that's the cover of Jimmy's new CD.  Oh, shit.  That's terrible.  All you're going to do is put an Aussie shirt and a hoodie on that fucking hunk of shit,  and that's him.  That's just mean. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, is that mean-spirited?  Oh, man.  Ah, fucking A.  You don't look like that, Jimmy.  It's not just going to bring me to be personal.  I'm sorry, baby.  You don't look like that, baby.  You're a cutie patootie.  You know that.  I like you.  But love, Jimmy.  That's fucking, you know.  All right, let's, uh.  You can't help it.  Everyone good?  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  I'm good.  I'm good.  Help me.  I'm good.  Everyone good?  Everyone good?  I got the plugs in.  Peace out.  Yeah, Chicago this week.  And twit me.  Oh, I got Sandy Franny coming up, too.  You get me addicted to Twitter, man.  Oh, Sandy Franny?  Twitter rolls.  Twitter does roll.  Why, is your Twitter just one-line things?  It doesn't matter, dude.  It's just a dick thing.  It's your name with R after it.  Yeah.  I got San Francisco next weekend.  With R at the end.  Let's go home.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  It was great. 
[03:50:30]  We'll see you tomorrow, man.  What did I play last time?  I played that diary song, right?  Yeah, that was good.  That went over very well.  I went back to that book of diaries that I was telling you about, and I found another really  beautiful entry.  Okay.  So, now I think every song is going to be the new bowling.  No!  Will you stop?  It was a new diary entry that I thought was a really remarkable one, so I set it to music.  Okay.  Okay.  Dear diary, today was a great day. 
[03:51:00]  I bought myself a brand new horse.  She's strong and fast and so very beautiful.  And just a little wild, of course.  I know tomorrow I can tame her, if I only believe.  Wish me luck diary, Christopher Reeve. 
[03:51:30]  I just, I thought it was a really lovely way of expressing his love of the animal.  I haven't heard from him recently, so I don't know what's been going on, but I thought the  sentiment was really sweet.  I had no idea where you were going with that, too.  That's really funny, man. </pre>
