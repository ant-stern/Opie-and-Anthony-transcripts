<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, expressing significant frustration over SiriusXM's inadequate planning for their upcoming Montreal broadcast.  They vehemently criticized the assigned conference room location, citing past negative experiences with similar subpar venues.  Their complaints extended to a perceived lack of communication and care from management regarding audience turnout, catering, and needed studio upgrades.  Kenny, a regular contributor, echoed their concerns, adding his own strong disapproval of the apparent lack of planning and support.  A listener called in, offering a positive comment about the show's recent improvement, which they attributed to better relations between Anthony and his wife.  The hosts then shifted to discussing a recent podcast episode, their varying opinions on modern movie trailers, and their recent movie viewings, including *The Conjuring* and *Pacific Rim*. This portion of the show was peppered with profanity and crude humor.

The discussion of *Pacific Rim* dominated a significant segment.  Hosts and callers praised the film's action sequences, especially the giant robot versus monster battles, while simultaneously mocking its nonsensical plot and cheesy dialogue.  Charlie Day's performance was singled out for positive comedic relief.  Comparisons to *Independence Day* and *Godzilla* films were frequent.

The conversation then abruptly turned to the controversial Rolling Stone magazine cover featuring the Boston Marathon bomber. The hosts expressed outrage and bewilderment at the cover's imagery, suggesting it glorified the bomber and criticized the media's role in escalating the controversy. They debated the magazine's intentions and the potential consequences of such imagery.

A listener's tattoo, initially described as "KKTITN" (later clarified and covered up), sparked a lengthy discussion. The hosts and callers speculated on its meaning, offering humorous interpretations of its possible interpretations, amidst much speculation about the resemblance to KKK symbols.

The show then revisited the topic of the listener's poorly executed tattoo,  "K.I.T.N." (interpreted as "Keep Kicking Them in the Nuts"), within a microphone design. The hosts and callers criticized the tattoo's design and discussed potential cover-up options. This led to a broader discussion on tattoos, including one depicting a pin-up girl with a golf club, and the reactions of significant others to their partners' body art.  The conversation circled back to the Rolling Stone cover, with differing opinions expressed on the chosen photograph.  A substantial portion of this segment was dedicated to anecdotes about the hosts' past drug use, detailing experiences with crack, heroin, and crank, including a story about David Spade and a near-police arrest.  The hosts also discussed stand-up comedians Robert Kelly and Dan Soder, with Rich Vos promoting his upcoming performances at Levity Live.  A benefit for Otto, suffering from viral meningitis, was also mentioned, alongside some lighthearted banter about sundresses and the hosts' personal lives, including the game "asses up".  A brief call from a listener at SUNY Brockport added to the conversation.

A substantial segment focused on the futility of internships and exploitative "temp-to-hire" jobs.  Sam Roberts was the only guest in studio during this portion.  Listeners shared experiences with exploitative employment practices, and the hosts recounted their youthful misadventures, including petty theft (from a warehouse, school, McDonald's, and a supermarket), selling stolen goods, and running a high school gambling operation. A caller described a forklift accident resulting in immediate termination.  A lengthy, joking discussion about a caller, Joe DeRosa's, poorly executed George Carlin-inspired tattoo ensued, with the hosts and callers offering unsolicited critiques. Rich Vos promised to help DeRosa get the tattoo fixed. Colin Quinn briefly joined the conversation, adding to the ribbing. The British Open golf tournament was referenced throughout.

The final segment featured a contentious exchange between the hosts and comedian guests Colin Quinn (in studio) and Joe DeRosa (by phone).  The conversation involved arguments about their perceived career success, accusations of favoritism, and personal insults.  Quinn mentioned script consulting work on a movie. DeRosa spilled a drink on himself, providing a brief comedic moment.  The conversation devolved into name-calling and personal attacks.  The discussion shifted to criticizing DeRosa's tattoos, with Troy A. Kwan (by phone) joining in on the critique of tattoo artistry and planning. A listener called in with questions about tattoo artists, leading to recommendations. The movie *R.I.P.D.* received a brief plug.  The show concluded with a focus on the experiences of "Intern Douchebag," including discussions of unpaid internships, the value of networking, and frank, sexually explicit advice on improving his romantic life and navigating the college dating scene.  The hosts offered vulgar and sexually explicit language throughout this segment. The show ended with further banter and the hosts' opinions on the intern's situation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before. Has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly good.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to talk about.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking pizza again?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  Surprise!  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's pretty amazing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  How's everyone feeling?  Good?  Good.  It's the other Friday, I guess they call that, right?  It's my Friday.  It's your Friday.  Oh, it's my Friday.  Oh, that's right.  It's your Friday.  It's my Friday for a few more weeks.  How's that feel?  Pretty good?  Yeah, it feels great.  For the foreseeable future.  Linger.  Taking some Fridays off this summer, yes.  Yeah.  Not next Friday, because we're going to be in Montreal, Canada.  That's next week, huh?  There's a bit of a buzz as we broadcast from a conference room up there in Montreal. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, what happened there?  It might have been our fault.  Really?  Yeah, I guess there were emails and stuff saying that we were going to be broadcasting  from a conference room.  Oh, and we were like...  And then I finally became aware of it way too late to change anything.  So they're looking at me like, hey, idiot, we told you it was a conference room from  day one.  No other options, huh?  Well, I mean, you know, when they send their emails, it's such garbage and bullshit. 
[00:03:00]  I don't read any of it.  And then you get caught every once in a while.  Oh, and if they thought, like, to send us an email that said conference room, was that  the best they could get?  Because they should have known, like, what else was available aside from the conference  room?  Was the conference room the best place?  They're saying the conference room is going to be great.  I know.  I heard.  They're saying, you know, don't get caught up in the fact that it's a conference room.  It's going to look great.  It's going to be couches in there and broadcast equipment and, I believe, enough room for 
[00:03:30]  20 to 30 listeners.  Well, that could be cool.  Some listeners in there.  Fuck.  What are you going to do?  But then the other side is, you know, to get everything right, we're going to have to  start doing meetings again.  But then that is complete crap.  I can't even be, I cannot do that.  Because in our meeting, it would be maybe three minutes of, you know, important stuff.  Oh, Kenny popped up already.  What's up, Kenny? 
[00:04:00]  Kenny's right on the mic.  I don't know.  What I'm about to say might anger some people.  Oh, no.  That's not you, usually.  Oh, boy.  No, it's like, you know, I just found out recently, too, like, the company is spending  a lot of money to fly you to a foreign country to broadcast to no one.  You could just stay here and do that.  Yeah, it's kind of the same guys.  Yeah, the whole thing about traveling is the fan interaction for the fans. 
[00:04:30]  Right, right, right.  It's kind of the same guys.  It's on the list.  It's like Tom Papa.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'm like, wait, we could do that in New York.  Oh, my God.  So we're going to go all the way up there to talk to the same guy.  No, we'll get some different guys.  Yeah, somebody here thought that was a good idea because they weren't sure what type of  fan base you might have there, and they didn't want you guys to be embarrassed and have nobody  show up.  Oh, God.  We'd have a couple hundred easy.  Yeah, exactly.  Without even trying. 
[00:05:00]  The problem is, is like, there's no leadership here.  Why don't you get an executive producer, like, all of a sudden?  Like, what's with the company?  Like, you know, I'm tired of hearing people saying, oh, I don't give a shit.  Like, it's not my responsibility.  Like, this is the people that work on the show.  It's their livelihood.  You think they would fucking, like, care a little bit.  Yeah.  Have some passion.  Nothing.  No.  But, like, the company's like, you know, hire an executive producer and, like, you know, 
[00:05:30]  and hold people accountable.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and, like, be a professional fucking thing.  What were the other options?  Do you know what other options were?  They treat me like a stepchild, all right?  Because I'm not a company employee.  I'm a subcontractor.  Right.  So, you know, since I'm not an employee and just a subcontractor, for any consulting,  they would have to pay me by the hour, all right?  So, they'd rather do things on their own, all right? 
[00:06:00]  And then I find out last minute.  And I was the one that stirred up the pot about not having a fucking audience.  Because if you remember, weren't we in L.A. once, and we sat in a conference room and  broadcasted to fucking nobody?  Oh, that was, uh, was that the poker tournament?  Yeah.  You know, one day you were on the casino floor.  The next day, we were in a fucking conference room.  Right, right.  Staring at each other, broadcasting to nobody.  In one of those horrible conference rooms, too.  Yeah, well, this is what, what, every fucking hotel has a horrible conference room. 
[00:06:30]  That's true.  They're not any different just because they put a couch in there.  So, you're on a need-to-know basis?  Yeah, yeah, they just, you know.  I tried with Rob and Gary.  I'm like, look, obviously I'm finding out a little too late, but is there anything we  could do?  Well, that's what I told people.  And they didn't really want to, they didn't really want to even try.  I go, those guys don't pay attention when you talk to them.  They listen with half an ear, and they fucking yes you to death.  That's why you have to have a fucking boss of the show to take care of your business. 
[00:07:00]  Something a little more festive, somewhere a little more festive than a conference room.  Somewhere, you know, where there's people walking around with all the excitement of  the comedy festival.  It's a fucking festival.  Right.  The whole fucking town is abuzz.  Right, right, right.  So, why can't the conference room be abuzz?  It can be, if it's set up that way.  It's going to be set up that way.  Right, Sam Roberts?  Yes, we're going to have decorations, we're going to bring some ribbons.  Nice.  Ribbons.  I think there's a Dwayne Reed near the hotel, so we're going to get some balloons and ribbons. 
[00:07:30]  A party kit, yeah.  Maybe we can fool around with the conference phone that's going to be on the long table.  Oh, yeah.  Could fool around with that a little bit.  Why don't we get a pinata to beat?  Yeah.  Why don't we beat you?  Unfortunately, I'm not even going to be there.  What?  And that, you know, I'm torn about, too, but I have to do something else.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  We're not that important.  No, you're very important.  KTC.  Yes, KTC, and you're going to have, you know. 
[00:08:00]  Things.  Yeah, guys.  Things and guys.  Yeah.  In the conference room.  Yeah.  Is it one of those conference rooms that, like, you see, like, they film, like, toddlers  and tiaras in?  I wouldn't know.  Nobody's told me.  Oh, no.  It's not that big.  What's wrong with you?  Are you sure?  No, because you're thinking conference room, like, down at the end of the hall.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  I'm thinking it's going to be.  Ballroom.  Not ballroom.  In between.  But, like, they call them a conference room. 
[00:08:30]  It's kind of a, yeah, yeah.  It's a little bigger than a conference room.  I'm assuming.  But smaller than a ballroom.  If they're saying we can fit 30 listeners in there.  Maybe 40.  I'm assuming it's more of a.  To be fair.  Maybe.  A small banquet slash conference.  Well, there's a name for it.  They call it a conference room in a hotel, but it's not.  To be fair, they said it's going to be good.  But, yeah, I was given the name of it, like, it's Soprano Room C on the fourth floor.  Oh, okay.  Something like that.  It's one of those.  Yeah.  It's one of those. 
[00:09:00]  So, it sounds like it could be good.  I don't understand what's wrong, Kenny.  Oh, boy.  Can we see the actual room?  I'm going to look for it.  Let's see the high.  Oh, if it's that room.  That looks neat.  Conference room.  Is it that room?  I don't think it's that room.  Why can't we broadcast from there?  That, I believe, is the lobby.  So?  The lobby would have actually.  The lobby would rock, because you've got people coming and going.  Exactly.  Yeah, there's an artist lounge where all the talent hangs out in.  That's like a cool place.  Let's broadcast there.  Oh, maybe it's this room.  That's a conference room.  That's like a regular conference room. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, no.  Is it online?  Come on.  I'm looking for a list of conference rooms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've been wanting to broadcast in Canada forever.  I know.  We're finally doing it, and it's in a conference room.  That's good, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, my Lord.  Yeah.  I mean, what's a show if not really just a fun conference, anyway?  That's true.  You're conferencing with the people.  Right.  Each other.  The listeners.  Maybe we could create a nice PowerPoint that's fun, though. 
[00:10:00]  I'd rather take a chance than be embarrassed.  Yeah.  If we set up a big place and all of a sudden a hundred people show up, oh, well.  That would be great.  I'd rather take the chance.  I'd rather take the chance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Because then it was brought to my attention, like, well, remember what happened at K-Rock  with the, you know, at the Hard Rock when, you know, only, you know, a hundred people  showed up.  Oh, you've got to remind us of the big Halloween party that was a bust?  Yeah.  That was a huge bust. 
[00:10:30]  I said, those guys are to blame for that, because garbage in, garbage out.  You've got to fucking promote it like it's the best thing in the fucking world, like  you can't miss it.  Yeah, we fucked that one up.  You know, right.  That was one of our fuck-ups.  Right.  We didn't promote it.  No.  No.  No, we didn't.  Yeah, if you pissed all over it, like, you know, I'm going to fuck that.  I'm not going to promote it.  We didn't promote it.  Like, if those guys don't want to be in there, I'm not going to be in there.  Right, well.  You know.  But, like.  I like that.  Garbage in.  Garbage out.  That's exactly it. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  That was a bad one.  And that was like our 850-second appearance at the fucking Hard Rock, too.  Yeah, we kind of blew that one.  Enough.  Yeah, we did.  We got ourselves to blame.  Psycho Bob has a little something about our Montreal trip.  Psycho Bob from Baltimore.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I was just wondering if they're going to throw in a free continental breakfast with a  pancake from Canadian bacon.  A free continental breakfast.  Should we at least get a continental breakfast in the conference room while we're broadcasting? 
[00:11:30]  I hope so.  Well, that was another issue.  Like.  What?  I had to bring up catering.  You had to bring up catering?  Yeah, because I guess, like, nobody knows.  That we eat?  Every remote broadcast we did before and everything.  You know, it's like.  You know, so I had to bring it up to make sure, like, you guys are taken care of.  Right.  And what do they say?  Oh, there's food for purchase.  They didn't say that.  We should have, like, a big buffet thing in the conference room. 
[00:12:00]  No, because then, you know what?  These assholes don't want to hear this.  Because now we start sounding like divas.  But I do want a basic fucking chance at breakfast.  You don't sound like divas.  Yeah, breakfast is the most important meal.  Of course it is.  But that and the guests need stuff.  So, yeah, that should be readily available.  Yeah, it's a fucking party.  It's a party.  Yeah.  Indeed.  It's a conference, not a party.  Like Anthony, you're a great host at your party.  Oh, I love it.  You have DJs.  You have chefs.  Barbecues.  Yeah.  Chefs.  Fucking booze.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  Everything.  Exactly.  Entertainment.  Let the guests.  Your guests should have nothing to want for.  Exactly.  Yes.  And just fun, fun, fun.  Is that it?  Sam?  That's the meeting room.  That probably, this is my best guess.  All right, well.  I mean, look at it.  It's like some fun blue carpeting.  And Kenny, you might be mistaken because there is some coffee right here on this table.  Well, no, maybe those guys know how to plan something.  There's a table with coffee on it.  That's good. 
[00:13:00]  That's all I know.  All right, yeah, coffee and water.  Good for you.  Maybe a little Danish.  Oh.  No, you eat healthy.  A nice little Danish.  No, no, you're eating healthy.  You're losing weight.  I am losing weight.  Get some nice fresh fruit.  Finally losing a few pounds.  I don't want Danish.  I'm getting rid of the baby weight finally.  Kenny, you don't think the planning's gone well for the trip so far?  I wouldn't know.  Nobody's planning with me.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, you don't really know how to plan trips.  No.  It's not in your past.  Why would I?  I've only been on the road since 1989. 
[00:13:30]  You really don't know how to plan trips away.  Yeah, a bus trip.  Are you involved with the bus trip?  I don't know what happened to the bus trip.  I think they can only do one project at a time here.  Remember, it's not on my calendar.  I'm telling you right now, the bus trip is officially not on my calendar.  You're taking it off?  No.  No.  Or you never put it off?  I don't believe it's happening.  The end of September.  Middle to end of September.  Is there a definite date?  I don't remember.  I thought there was. 
[00:14:00]  Because I would like, if there's a definite date, I would like to put it in my calendar.  I think there is a date.  I would like to put it in your calendar.  Because then you're going to like, that week, you're not going to do anything.  And then they're going to say, oh, you know what, we can't do the bus trip.  And then you're going to fuck yourself.  You know what's funny?  I have nothing in my calendar.  Okay.  If you had a boss of the show, they could sit in front of this microphone and fill you  in on details.  Right.  Who do you think should be planning with you?  A boss of the show.  There isn't one of those, though.  I know.  So that's.  You're not the boss of me. 
[00:14:30]  I got bought by those.  Go ahead.  I'm in fucking coffin already.  Well, do you guys want a boss at the show or you're straight?  I just want to get a few jokes out there.  That's the whole thing.  Get a few jokes.  That's why you need a boss.  So you guys.  Bother a couple people.  Focus on being creative.  Maybe talk a little music every once in a while.  Yeah.  Make believe I know a lot about sports.  And, you know, promote a dumb video or something that I've done. 
[00:15:00]  You just need Mars to make sure the mics are on.  That's right.  And then you're ready to go.  Yeah.  It's easier that way.  Yeah.  It really is easier that way.  But then we get caught every once in a while when we do try to plan something.  Because they gave us the green light.  I said it on the after show yesterday for the animation festival.  But that was two months ago.  And I forgot about that.  See, it's laughing.  I forgot about that.  We were given the green light for the animation festival.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're getting up. 
[00:15:30]  Moving ahead.  And then it's like nothing.  This is why, though, Kenny.  But then we get caught every once in a while.  And you find out we're broadcasting from a conference room.  So I do take some blame.  But with all the shit that kind of, like, just kind of, I don't know, revolves around the outside of the show.  I remember that.  What about the guys that came in here to redesign our studio?  How long ago was that?  What did I tell you?  It's going to laugh again.  What did I tell you?  Remember, they're like, they're looking, writing notes. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, we need to come in here.  This needs to go.  There was five guys.  Nothing.  And, you know, there's basic stuff.  Like, I don't know.  I mean, I can't even give them.  I can't give them the benefit of the doubt.  Because even basic shit, like you said, these big, huge monitors in front of you could go tomorrow.  How hard would it be to just unplug those and get rid of that, at least?  How long ago was that?  Who should be following up with?  Wait, wait, wait, Sam.  I got this. 
[00:16:30]  So then the guys leave.  There's like five or six of them.  And Sam turns to me and goes, you know, nothing's going to happen, right?  And I go, damn it, I got tricked.  Remember I said that to you?  Because for once I got tricked, I'm like, oh, my God, I think they're actually going to do something.  No.  And Sam looks at me and goes, you're, no, nothing's going to happen.  You know that.  Oh, my God.  How long ago was that, to be honest, when they were standing over us?  It was over a month ago.  Yeah.  And, you know, it was supposed to move ahead in some way, shape, or form, right? 
[00:17:00]  I said at the very least, because I even said at the time, I go, all right, you know, they've got to cut the console a little bit.  They might try to get rid of this big board in front of me.  Push it forward.  They could have done it when you were on vacation that week.  Oh, right.  So I said, look, all right, it might take a little more time, but I go, at the very least, could you guys at least take a lot of the clutter, you know, out of this place?  Remember?  Right.  They said, no problem on it.  That's why I went Rob and, you know, Gary, they're nice guys, but. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  They just, you know.  Yeah, but you guys got to put your foot down, because obviously.  I don't care.  Well, you have to care.  I don't care.  It's your name on the channel.  It's your name on the book.  It's your show.  I don't care.  That's why you have to put people in place to care for you.  Dude, care.  We don't have the authority to put people in place.  Huh?  We don't have the authority to put people in place.  That's why, you know, your agent should pick up the phone. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  I am giggling like a schoolgirl this morning with all these things.  It's so freeing not to care, Kenny, because for many years, I did.  Kenny.  I'd be yelling at this person or that person.  Yeah, but do you enjoy being a multimillionaire?  Oh.  That's all right.  What?  I was probably happier with less money.  What?  Well, that's what you're going to have, the way everything's continuing.  I haven't been a money guy.  Most people know that.  I'm happy I'm able to get a beach house this summer. 
[00:18:30]  You're right.  I'd like to be a multimillionaire.  Well, who do you think should be following up with your boss?  It doesn't suck.  Yeah, exactly.  No, of course it's cool.  You want to be a multimillionaire?  Well, you're going to have to change your attitude, first of all.  That's always been my problem.  I have a propensity to piss people off.  Your attitude's a little rough.  I know.  You've got to soften the edges a little bit.  I'm a little rough around the edges.  You're right.  You can't teach an old dog new tricks.  It's a curse. 
[00:19:00]  It's a curse.  What bothers me is we're probably only a couple months away from the next Scott Greenstein meeting.  We're going to have to throw my hands up in the air.  You were there.  I threw my hands up in the air a million times going, we've been talking about this for a year.  I know.  He goes, well, I have no problem with it.  Yeah, do it.  The animation festival sounds great.  Let's get that moving.  Talk to Bill Stettering.  Have you spoken to him?  No, you'll love Bill.  He throws names out that I've never heard. 
[00:19:30]  I never hear him again.  My face, my head was spinning.  I'm like, keep up with all these names you're throwing at me.  Put Carol Blake on that one.  Carol?  All right, get Carol Blake on the phone.  I'm like, who?  What?  And then you can never hear anything again.  Right.  Someone tweeted, and I didn't write him back yesterday, and I apologize because I do try to write a bunch of people back.  Said, why don't you guys do bits anymore?  Because the latest Opie and Anthony podcast has the Stalker Patty mousetraps and the street fishing we did with porn items and Bill Burr. 
[00:20:00]  And that podcast is available in all the usual places.  Please get it.  It's podcast number 10.  That just turned into a little promotion there.  Sorry.  But so a guy, you know, he downloaded the podcast.  He enjoyed it.  He goes, why don't you guys do bits anymore?  Oh, bits.  Is it because of all the red tape?  Or I forgot exactly how he phrased it.  You know, around you.  Oh, lawyers.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Fucking lawyers.  We never wanted to stop doing bits. 
[00:20:30]  It got to a point that we're like, holy fuck, we can't do bits anymore.  Yep.  We can't do it in this environment.  Can't do it.  Maybe if you had a boss to the show that, like, would have a vision and could coordinate things.  Just start with a boss.  Right.  So.  Yeah.  But, I mean, I think the guys are going to come in here any day now and get rid of the clutter, at least.  And then they're going to cut the console like we want it.  And they're going to get rid of the big fucking huge board in front of me.  Right.  Or push it forward, like I said.  Because they said, if you remove some of the clutter, then I can push this forward, and then I'm good. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Do you think that's going to happen?  Well, they said.  Come on.  Well, the funny thing is, now that we're bitching a little bit, it's going to be really awkward when you come in here tomorrow,  because I won't be here, Anthony, and the clutter will be cleaned up.  Oh, right, right.  And they will make believe, no, man, you know, we were planning on doing this.  Remember the flap?  Like the flap and the coat rack thing.  No.  Yeah.  I remember that.  But Montreal's going to be great. 
[00:21:30]  Is it?  And he's disgusted.  I love it.  But the other side of it, it's really cool to have a job where you really don't have a boss.  Oh, yeah.  We don't see anyone.  It's the strangest thing ever.  I do like that.  We don't get any feedback from anyone around here.  No.  We get a little from Steve Blatter, I guess.  There should be someone whose sole job is to, only job, is to take care of things like that. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, you should have representation.  You should have your talent.  We have Steve Blatter, Rob Cross, and Gary.  Those are three guys that should be taking care of some, you know, big fucking issues.  They're supposed to be the guys, Kenny.  Why do we need a guy?  That are associated with the radio show.  To take care of things that the guys should be taking care of.  I don't know what their job description is.  I don't either.  Plus, all those guys, this show is one of their jobs. 
[00:22:30]  It's not their job.  It's one of.  Yeah, I know.  There should be one of the guys on the corporate level that only takes care of this show.  Yeah, you guys have a channel.  There should be a program director for your channel.  A program director for the channel.  True.  True.  And then an executive producer of the show.  You know, take care of business.  So you guys just focus on being creative.  We got good people working for the show.  There is no. 
[00:23:00]  Good people that have been beat down and don't give a shit about nothing no more.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know, all they'd rather do is throw each other under the bus and set each other up for failure  rather than help each other out and cover for each other.  And lift each other up.  Yeah.  Remember, we got the people who reminded me here.  Remember, they gave us those giant garbage pails.  That's right.  Remember the big.  I couldn't even get to my spot.  Remember the giant garbage pails. 
[00:23:30]  They mean well.  They were like.  They were New York City garbage pails.  They were giant.  The thing you would see on the corners.  On every corner.  Yes.  And they'll go, oh, they weren't that big.  I would bet a lot of money they were very close to that size.  There's one still in the hallway.  Yeah.  That's pretty big.  That's just the regulation fucking garbage pail.  Yeah.  You know, any day they're going to get rid of the clutter that we said you could do immediately.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I love it. 
[00:24:00]  So, bus trip?  Maybe.  I guess.  Animation festival?  Maybe.  I would say certainly not.  Why, we tried that once already.  I had the whole budget I presented.  You did.  For what?  For the animation festival.  That was the first project that was presented once Sirius took over.  Why, Kenny, the resistance toward you?  Because we all know your talents and stuff. 
[00:24:30]  You said you've been on the road since 89 with many successful tours and whatnot.  And why the resistance toward you?  It probably goes back to when I heckled Jack Clayton at the fucking press conference.  Do you realize there's no one left from that episode to even be mad at you?  There's probably the ghost of fucking some jerk off running around here.  I got scared.  I thought I was going to have to pay Kenny's bills for a very long time.  Because that was my idea. 
[00:25:00]  And I skated.  I skated and they wanted your head.  Yeah, but you stood up for me.  You did the right thing.  Well, I know.  Wow.  That's boring radio.  That was a big one.  I did whatever I could, but...  It was a big one.  Basically, what was his name?  Joe Clayton.  Yeah, Joe or Jack or something.  We were out there on, what, CES?  Yeah, it was a big fan fair.  And XM had its little place there, which was kind of cool.  And then Sirius...  Better than a conference room.  No.  They used to do it up nice. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Remember?  Yeah.  Remember our Vegas trips?  That's ages ago.  We used to go every year.  Every year we'd be at CES.  For three or four days.  Nice.  Big stage with a fucking broadcasting right there.  Beautiful.  In front of everybody.  So that was my point to Gary the other day.  And he panicked.  Like, because he can't, like, figure shit out, like, on the fly.  Yeah.  I think he's one of these, like, OCD guys that everything has to be, oh, my God.  Right.  So that's exactly what I'm talking about.  At CES, when we were broadcasting, people were just coming through. 
[00:26:00]  And we grabbed people because we were in a public place.  Yeah.  With a lot of, you know, people, you know, moving around.  Hmm.  But the Joe Clayton thing.  Yeah, they had...  It was a big press conference.  Huge.  There had to be...  I forgot what they were announcing.  I don't know if it was the Howard thing.  Yeah, the Howard thing.  Was it?  Well, Satellite was basically launching.  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  We were already there.  Yeah, but it was the beginning of... 
[00:26:30]  It was the beginning of their company going to the next level.  Right.  And they had the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders come out and do a big fucking thing.  Right.  They played that song, like, let's get it started in here.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, we were done with our thing.  And I go, Kenny, let's go take a look.  See what's going on over there.  So, they're getting ready to, you know, start the festivities.  And I go, Kenny, I forgot how I said it to you.  I'm like, can you heckle Joe Clayton?  No.  You're like, Kenny, do something. 
[00:27:00]  I'm like, what?  Well, because, you know, that fucking guy, way back in the day, you know, we had a spot  at Sirius.  And then, all of a sudden, they shut down negotiations and made believe they never talked to us.  And that always fucking pissed me off.  Obviously, they had a plan that didn't include us.  They realized they could get Howard.  So, they're like, well, fuck, why would we get these guys and pay them, you know, a lot  of money when we could, you know, get Howard?  I understand from a business point, but they were scumbags about it.  And just, they never even returned our calls when we thought we had to deal with them. 
[00:27:30]  So, you know, there's Joe Clayton.  And I'm like, Kenny, can you fucking say something?  And what did you say officially?  Well, we were like in the back of 150 people.  Oh, I think it was more than that.  But, okay.  And then, like, I knew what I was doing.  So, I timed it perfectly while he was giving his speech.  At the end of the sentence, I screamed out, can't hear you back here.  That's all.  Yeah, but I said it like 20 times.  Well, all right.  I didn't, yeah, you're right. 
[00:28:00]  Until I got chased out of there.  And then security came.  Yeah.  And then I saw, like, people I've known forever, I'll just say that, with their arms folded  with this disgust on their face.  I'm like, really, we work together.  You know this is what we do.  And they were so mad.  And then we thought of, who cares, it's the competition.  Exactly.  But Clayton went on the phone, talked to Hugh Pinero.  Get one CEO to the other.  And then next thing you know, Kenny's in, we're both in trouble, sort of, but more Kenny. 
[00:28:30]  We're in deep trouble.  I'm like, what are you, it's the competition.  Who gives a fuck?  What do you care?  Why are you even taking a phone call from that guy?  And then we weren't allowed to hire Kenny, and then we did some month-to-the-table shit  with Eric Logan, who was beyond cool.  He's like, look, you could still have Kenny, but he can't really be on the book, so we're  going to pay him this way.  We had like a bag man, I think, basically, to pay Kenny for a while.  What happened to that guy?  Well, when Mel moved in, they showed him the door. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know where he is now.  But that's what I mean.  He's kind of not with company.  When Mel Carsey moved in.  No, he's out.  I hope he's out.  Fuck.  Is he on the board or something?  Oh, shit.  I don't think so.  I think he's out, out.  But then I'm looking at Hugh Pinero, like, we're really in trouble for this?  Really?  Well.  And then he didn't want Kenny around at all.  It's not a surprise, that's for sure.  And then when Hugh Pinero finally left, thank God.  Although we had asshole number two come in. 
[00:29:30]  Well, yeah.  They're all assholes in the end, aren't they?  Then we were allowed to hire Kenny through Eric Logan.  Yeah.  He's been here ever since.  Oh, my God.  What a fucking soap opera.  Yeah.  How do you give a shit that Kenny yells something out at the competition?  The competition.  That's what I was thinking.  No wonder they got fucking acquired by Sirius.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They were the jackasses.  They fucking bent over and just spread their cheeks for Sirius. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, XM bent over.  No lube.  Big Sirius.  Dry dick.  Just fucking.  Ah!  And all these assholes thinking it was.  I mean, I guess in the end it was a good thing, but they were all excited.  I'm like, no, you idiots.  They're going to push all of you out.  You guys are gone.  We're pretty much the last people from XM still around.  And Wiki somehow.  I don't know.  I wrote him the other day, and it said the email wasn't valid.  Uh-oh.  That happened to me once, too. 
[00:30:30]  What's going on with Don Wicklund?  I don't know.  I asked him, but I didn't know.  Don, text me.  Are you still around?  I don't even know.  They're down in Washington.  Remember our Washington trips?  Those were nice.  That was fun.  Those were interesting.  I liked the little cafeteria.  I loved it.  Hot lunch every day.  Yeah.  After our show.  It was awesome.  The hip-hop guys would sit at one table.  Oh, yeah.  Little cliques, just like school. 
[00:31:00]  Just like prison, segregated.  Prison.  It kind of was, though.  The right-wing talk show hosts were at another table.  Yeah.  Then you had the emo kids over there, and the fucking alt-rock guys.  Classic rock guys.  Classic rock guys.  Just getting high.  That was fun.  Eh, whatever.  No, Don Wicklund.  He's still in a plea.  He fucking wound up.  Why is this publicity shot in front of a funhouse mirror? 
[00:31:30]  He definitely.  Knock it on, man.  What's going on there, Don?  Looks like a little round.  All right.  Yeah, he pulled a cockroach move there.  He's still alive.  Nah, he's good.  After the nuke.  He's good people.  Yeah.  Anyway, so we're going to be in Montreal next week.  Yeah.  Thursday and Friday, broadcasting live.  Brush up on your French.  Is that it? 
[00:32:00]  Don't they speak that there?  In Montreux.  Montreux.  Montreux.  Montreux.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the conference room.  Look for it.  Look for it as in a conference room near you.  It's so weird.  This stuff used to.  Check your local conference rooms.  This stuff used to get my blood pressure arising.  Not anymore.  No, it's just...  I find it hilarious, though.  No, it's just...  It's a complete turnaround for me.  I just laugh now. 
[00:32:30]  It's what it is.  It's what it is.  Are we just going to get an audience on site?  Well, I don't know.  Well, that's what I asked.  Is it open to the general...  Free to the general public?  Or is it only for festival badge holders?  Oh, God.  And then I was told, no, it's to nobody.  I don't know.  It'll be...  It'll be all right.  It's to nobody.  It'll be all right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, how are we getting people in?  Who are they?  It's 7 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:33:00]  It's not like they're going to be walking around on the sidewalk.  Well, I was up there many years ago when we were off the air, and Brother Weez was broadcasting live.  And I was trying to explain this to Gary.  I'm like, he was in an area where, you know, people were just walking around.  It was sort of in the lobby, I guess.  But it was, like, on the second floor of the lobby, if that makes sense, overlooking the, you know, the big lobby below.  And he got so many people just because they were, you know, checking in.  They were getting up early to jog or have a smoke or get coffee or go to the gym. 
[00:33:30]  And we were...  He was just grabbing people he would have never got.  But think about it.  Maybe we'll get the people that inadvertently open the door and go, oh, excuse me.  Right.  And then close it again because they thought it was...  Is this the Johnson meeting?  No.  No.  I'm sorry.  Do you want to do a couple minutes on the radio, though?  No, no, no.  No.  Johnson meeting.  Johnson meeting.  I'm late.  It's all good, Kenny.  It should be fun.  No, it's not. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  This is a sinking ship.  Kenny's disgusted with the organization.  What's more exciting than a sinking ship, though, Kenny?  Think about it.  Yeah, but this is my livelihood.  I'd like to see it.  Oh, my God.  Don't count on me or Anthony for your livelihood at this point.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  No.  I'm looking at sailboats already.  Oh, boy.  I'm looking at sailboats, and you know what that means.  Sailboats.  Like the Kennedys.  I'm looking at sailboats. 
[00:34:30]  Don't count on me for your livelihood.  Wow.  We've made it to the top of the mountain.  We're on our way down now.  Right.  Okay.  We've left the dead bodies at the top.  I mean, now we're fucking going back to the base camp.  We're good.  Sliding down.  We're good.  Unless someone wants to reinvent this whole thing, then I'm all in.  Yeah, a boss.  Yeah.  Hey, boss.  Hey, boss.  Hey.  Hey, boss.  We don't have a boss. 
[00:35:00]  Exactly.  Oh.  Bruce.  Don't worry.  They're going to take care of the studio any day, though.  Any day now.  Who is?  I do know they gave me some weird excuse, like something happened to one of the guys.  Exactly.  He had personal stuff.  I just went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.  I found out it's because it was going to cost $230,000.  Oh, my God.  We forgot about the wall.  The wall.  We forgot about the wall.  Entertainment Weekly's been having a time of their life in that studio.  Have they?  Who would know?  They don't talk to anybody.  They're the unfriendliest people in the hallway. 
[00:35:30]  He just needs people to be nice to them in the hallway.  I love Kenny.  Kenny, we've been here four years.  I just nod at people still.  Yeah.  We're not friendly.  They don't even do that.  We're not friendly.  Where do you see them?  I see them.  They come to work.  They start their show.  It's 7 o'clock.  I would have no idea.  Could you point them out next time they walk by?  Because I don't even know who they are, what they look like.  They go around.  They don't come near him.  This is like a pariah in his fucking thing.  People, the talent handlers bring the fucking talent this far away. 
[00:36:00]  Well, I would do things so differently if I was in charge.  Like, we get guests because we're assholes.  We'll open the door and I'll shout out some stupid shit.  And they pop in.  And they pop in.  You get some cool interaction for maybe a couple minutes.  Do you realize that the company gets really mad at us for doing that?  I don't know why they get mad at us.  We're all the same company. 
[00:36:30]  And in the end, nothing gets changed.  Nothing's bad.  The place that they're going doesn't get any less time.  And if some other show grabs one of our guests as they're heading into here, who cares?  I wouldn't care.  For two minutes?  As long as we get them on the show.  So now what happens is the talent bookers that bring the people around, the handlers for SiriusXM,  they're starting to avoid our studio.  So we don't have that quick interaction. 
[00:37:00]  Like a pariah.  Right.  So we don't have that impromptu thing.  Which, if I was a listener of this show, I would think it's kind of cool.  All of a sudden, you're like, what?  I didn't know Blah Blah was going to be on the show today.  But we didn't know either because all of a sudden, he just is outside the studio.  Yep.  Makes it cool.  Yep.  All right.  Let me get your breakfast.  Oh.  Let me say hi to Jeff in Delaware.  Jeff, how are you, sir? 
[00:37:30]  I'm doing well, thanks.  Hey, I just wanted to say, the show you guys have been doing lately, it seems a lot better.  I don't know if something's changed.  Anthony seems a lot happier.  For the past six months, I've strictly only listened to you guys in the morning.  What happened there?  Me and Ann are getting along these days.  It's a little weird.  A little strange for both of us, I'm sure.  Let's be honest.  We're getting along. 
[00:38:00]  Makes it a lot easier.  It does.  It does.  As I say this, I can't even look at them.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean?  Let me turn this around.  We're getting along.  Thanks, Jeff.  I told you they were.  Christ, enough already.  Enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's no secret.  There's been times we don't get along.  Of course.  We've been at this over, we're pushing 20 years now.  You don't even get along with people that you have sex with for that long. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Constantly.  Of course we go through our times we don't get along.  But for some weird reason, we're still able to do radio, which is really strange to me.  Radio.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  No, I personally feel really good about the show lately.  Yeah, me too.  Definitely.  And I appreciate the phone call.  All right.  Appreciate your call.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think that was bitching.  I thought it was.  No, it's hilarious when Kenny sits down.  I'm fully aware that bitching gets a little old.  But when Kenny. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, Kenny's in there.  You've got to let him go.  I kind of like that.  You've got to let him go off.  And then bringing up some of the things that were supposed to happen and having Anthony laugh because he forgot about it.  I forgot about it.  And I'm like, oh, yeah, the console.  It just.  Oh, yeah.  And I like bringing it up because I really, I really truly believe.  Yeah.  We sit there like.  Wow.  That this happens to, you know, the people out there going to their jobs.  Yeah.  It's just amazing how nothing gets done anymore. 
[00:39:30]  And I was going to say in this country, but in the, in the work, in the workplace.  Yeah.  Nothing gets done.  Everything just is.  They just have to overthink everything.  And we hear about like how, oh, we'll fix the console.  We'll do it.  It reaches like the, the, the starting point.  Right.  And then just goes nowhere.  And, and I even, the last time, you know, they were talking about fixing the console in our studio.  I'm like, I even knew in my head.  I'm like, okay.  You know, the odds of them doing this immediately is, is very slim. 
[00:40:00]  But I go, look, at the, at the very least, you can get rid of the two monitors that Anthony has officially said.  He doesn't need it at all.  Yeah.  He just needs one of them replaced.  Now it's going to look.  With a small one.  Yeah.  Tiny monitor.  But if you do that, then I'm going to be able to push this console forward.  Uh-huh.  Which will give me more room.  I'll be cool over here.  Then there's some of this weird shit.  Remember we even pointed at this stuff?  Yeah.  This stuff.  That's still here.  Like, why is the phone in the middle of the console?  We don't use that big, huge phone from 19, I would say 92. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And these keyboards are like, what do they do?  We go, I don't know.  No, to be honest with you.  I think you could just get rid of those or you could at least hide them somewhere else.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, okay, we'll be on it.  We'll get right on that.  Yeah.  It's going to be awkward tomorrow when some of this stuff is cleaned up.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to wonder who did it and who was instructed to do it.  Probably a meeting.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  What's going on out there?  Out in the world?  Yeah.  Out there, we talked about it in here.  I went to the movies last night.  You went to the movies last night?  I went to the movies.  Now, you don't like going to the movie theater.  No, but it wasn't bad.  Who's that?  Who?  That.  Which one, the blind?  The one that's a little haggerty.  Is that a word?  Haggerty?  Haggerty.  That's the last name of Grizzly Adams.  Damn haggerty.  She's a bit haggard. 
[00:41:30]  I think that works, right?  I'm not sure.  There's one...  She looked kind of famous.  Oh, she was being led to Pete Dominick's show.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know who it was, but that's where she was being led to.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  So, I guess they're going to be talking about George Zimmerman.  Probably.  Anyway, you went to the movies.  Yeah, went to the movies.  I went to see...  The Conjuring.  No.  Very scary. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know if I want to see that at night.  The reviews in the paper today are...  Really?  The trailer's the best part.  Why is that?  Oh, because the trailer's the best part, yeah.  I think so.  Dude, I saw a trailer for that new movie with Matt Damon that's coming out.  Yeah.  Futuristic.  Looks good.  Matt Damon playing Matt Damon?  One of those movies?  Matt Damon.  He kind of plays himself in every movie, doesn't he? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  It's like the Bourne character all the time.  Elysium?  Yes.  Elysium.  Getting very good buzz.  It looks really good.  It's got that District 9 look to it.  Same people that did it.  It seems like a pretty cool little storyline.  But I saw the whole movie.  Yeah.  I saw the whole movie in the trailer.  And I know this has been brought up many times and, you know...  But when you're sitting there watching it, it's like, what?  That's like a plot point. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  That's a fucking plot point.  Right.  I'm supposed to be watching the movie, and when that part happens, I'm supposed to go,  holy shit, whoa.  Whoa.  That's like...  And they just blow it.  You could pretty much...  We probably shouldn't do it for the people, but you could pretty much, you know, give a  review of the movie, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it's because they feel they're leaving out, like, the end.  Or talk about the whole story.  Meanwhile, you could probably figure out what the end's going to be. 
[00:43:30]  They don't leave out the end.  Based on what happened in the trailer.  And they don't really leave out the end.  Well, they leave out the ending scene.  But you know what's going to happen.  You know it.  That other movie with Marky Mark and Denzel.  Two guns?  Two guns.  Huge plot points.  Really?  Huge plot points.  Just fucking thrown right out there.  Here it is.  And, I don't know. 
[00:44:00]  Whatever.  When did they change the trailers?  I don't know.  It wasn't that bad.  No.  Let's say, you know what?  The movie Sixth Sense.  Yeah.  With that huge surprise.  Uh-huh.  That Bruce Willis is dead the whole fucking movie, right?  Sure.  They would have gave that away in the trailers these days.  Probably would have, yeah.  In some way, they would have gave it away.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a time they held back, like you said, the plot points. 
[00:44:30]  Enough with the Francis size.  It's not the Francis size.  I know.  It's another parody.  What is that?  Everyone's parodying the Francis size or lady.  Enough.  Anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  How was Pacific Rim?  I saw Pacific Rim.  Sorry.  Oh, I thought you said that.  No, no.  That's okay.  How was it?  I was going to say it anyway.  You know what?  Awesome.  What do you mean awesome?  It was fucking awesome.  Really?  Yes.  Why?  Because, first of all, you don't go into the movie, a movie like Pacific Rim, expecting an 
[00:45:00]  amazing story and fantastic dialogue and acting and everything like that.  You go in because it's the whole thing is that this is an amazing, huge looking action, fucking monster movie.  Right.  And as far as that goes, one of the best I've ever seen.  Really?  As far as that type of genre goes.  It looked fantastic.  It's not in 3D.  It reminded me of, as a kid, like the old Godzilla movies. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, wow.  And shit.  But only done so well.  It looked fantastic.  You fucking, the giant fucking mechanical things were beating up on fucking animals.  Yeah.  When they, like they show these scenes like where the fucking machine is like running through  the water and you see the water fucking skirting off the legs of the thing.  It looked fucking amazing. 
[00:46:00]  How do they do that?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  It was awesome.  How do they do that shit?  And then say, look, look, Pacific Rim can suck my sweaty balls.  Now, what were you expecting?  I'm talking to the computer screen.  I don't know what this guy was expecting.  Like the dialogue.  Yeah.  Because I saw it too.  Yeah.  The dialogue was terrible.  Like I laughed at the dialogue.  Of course.  I was laughing too.  But that's the fun.  Yes.  Do you think the dialogue?  It's an over the top.  Okay.  Sorry.  Like over the top kind of movie. 
[00:46:30]  Was the dialogue meant to be made fun of a little bit?  Like they knew what they were doing?  Maybe a little tongue in cheek?  I think they knew it wasn't, you know, Academy Award winning writing.  When they're talking and like, you know, the father son team there.  Horrible.  The dialogue between them, my boy and stuff.  It's like supposed to be that Independence Day kind of, let's go get them boys kind of  a thing.  And I mean, for some reason, when they set movies in the future now, they figured out 
[00:47:00]  when the future is and they haven't moved that year forward as time has gone forward.  Because this movie takes place like in 2025, which is only in 12 years.  And everything looks like it does now anyway.  But they flash back to like when the aliens first came.  Yeah.  And you can tell based on the ages of the character that it was before 2013.  Oh, I see what happened.  It doesn't make any sense.  But that's fine.  So they got to push their year a little. 
[00:47:30]  Like who cares?  A little further, right?  Yeah, like 21, 25.  Like the little Asian girl.  Yeah, she would have been.  Like that didn't figure.  That would have been like 2010 or 2009.  Did it happen?  Did we miss it?  We didn't have that technology.  We didn't have like fucking deep sea alien things.  And that takes you out of the movie?  When they don't have the years right?  I mean, immediately I'm doing the math.  I'm like, no, no.  I never saw a big fucking robots and monsters.  Nothing took me out of this movie because I wasn't expecting anything. 
[00:48:00]  Nothing more from the dialogue and storyline and any things that, you know, continuity issues.  I didn't care.  All I cared about was that a fucking giant mechanical thing driven by two people grabbed a fucking monster,  rockets fired off its elbow, and it fucking slammed its fist into its face.  It looked great.  How about when they beat that fucking thing with a ship? 
[00:48:30]  That was the best part of the whole movie.  The best part of the movie.  Fucking walking down the street like I'm going to kick this motherfucking's ass.  This is...  And he's holding a ship in his hand.  Like a battleship?  It was like a fucking cargo ship.  Okay.  And he's holding it in his hand, and he grabs things like a fucking bat and wails this monster in the face.  I'm howling.  It's great.  Not only is he holding it like a bat, but this government manufactured machine is dragging a ship through Hong Kong and just millions of dollars in property damage. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  As he drags a ship with him halfway across the city.  It doesn't matter, though.  I can't think of the damage to the city, Sam.  This was 9,000 9-11s were happening in every second of this movie.  In every scene.  In every scene.  See, they were so smart.  Because they didn't try to make it about some dumb story where they're like, okay, we're going to build this up, and then at the end, we'll have the monster-robot-alien fight. 
[00:49:30]  45 seconds into the film was the first fight.  First fight.  Oh, good.  And throughout the movie, there's just fights.  They just have robot versus alien fights the entire movie.  And that's what you want to see.  What was the conflict?  Huh?  What was the conflict that they had to fight all the time?  Oh, they were aliens.  Evil aliens.  Under the ocean, in the big chasm down there.  So there's aliens down there, and who are they fighting?  Earth.  Earth, yeah, of course.  You know, they always want to take over the planet. 
[00:50:00]  But they're fighting other monsters, you said.  No, no, the government had to build these giant robotic things.  Oh, okay.  And fucking giant.  Do they have to build them right away?  No, this is over the course of years.  Okay.  And we're kind of losing the war.  Oh, shit.  That was the whole concept of it.  Now what?  And, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  God, these sundresses are going to drive me insane.  Oh.  You know, look at that.  These fucking baby doll sundresses that are walking around here. 
[00:50:30]  They're very see-through, very light.  It's unbelievable.  Like, when we were growing up, women didn't dress like that.  And then you go in the hallway, and you fucking maybe look down a little too long, and then you're in an HR meeting.  HR.  Look out.  Did you see that?  Yeah, I see it every day.  Every day.  It's wonderful.  Oh, the fuck.  Gotta love them.  So we're losing the war.  Yeah, we're losing the war.  You know, without giving away, I guess, too many plot points.  Not that there were any. 
[00:51:00]  Not that there were.  How great was...  Here's the spoiler for the movie, by the way.  They fight.  Fucking giant robotic fucking things, and sea creature-type aliens fight.  And where do the humans go as all this destruction's going on?  Well, the humans run the fucking robots.  They're in their head.  Not every human.  No, they're just...  What about, like, Plumber Joe?  Lots of them die.  Oh, yeah.  There's collateral damage all over the place.  But do the rest go, like, I don't know, like...  They go into shelters when this happens. 
[00:51:30]  Go see a relative somewhere else in another state?  Yeah.  Is it only on the west coast?  It's the Pacific Rim.  No, I understand.  So it's...  But they're branching out.  Look out.  It's all coastal areas.  No, it's safe.  Are we safe in New York from the...  For now.  Okay, good.  I think for now.  Okay, good.  You would think every single human being by 2025...  Yeah.  ...would have moved inland.  Yes.  Why would anybody live in a coastal environment?  Why are you still on the coast when these things pop up?  People are still on the beach.  One thing I found funny, too...  Yeah, because you want to go in the ocean.  There's aliens in the ocean. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  One thing I found very interesting, too, is there's aliens.  And they're just ravaging the earth.  And the Asian girl figured, you know, I'm going to dye my hair a little blue on the tips.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Like, wouldn't that be so far down the priority list of things at that point when people are  just dying by the hundreds of thousands that you're like, I think I need a little blue  hair dye.  Is there time for some love?  A little time for love, Dr. Jones. 
[00:52:30]  There's a little time for love?  A little time.  Well, you wonder, though.  A little romance?  You wonder.  Is it love?  Is it a brother-sister relationship?  You don't know.  You don't know.  How was Charlie Day?  That's all I want to know.  He was Charlie Day.  Your comic relief is here.  Because I like Charlie Day a lot.  That's what it was.  He was the wacky scientist kind of guy.  Yelling.  Trying to figure it out.  You know, there's the fighting, right?  Yeah.  There's the fighting.  But then there's the other side of the battle, which is let's try to figure them out kind  of a thing.  And that's where he comes in.  Try to figure out the aliens?  Oh, yeah.  Why would you do that? 
[00:53:00]  Well, look at an ID4.  They have no interest in living in harmony with us?  You had to fucking kind of figure them out a little to see what the best way to send  your rock-em-sock-em robots in.  Right.  Did you notice?  Because obviously they have communicators in the robots in their helmets.  Yeah.  Back with base.  Yep.  Did you notice how far those communicators could go?  It's the future.  It's 2025.  It's 2025.  Not that far.  Remember, a mere six years ago, I had a Pebble phone.  So it is possible.  Right. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Fucking ruled.  It did, huh?  I was watching this.  Just going like, fuck, that's cool.  Interdimensional walkie-talkies.  That's true, too.  Will be in existence by 2025.  Yes.  With the flying cars?  Any flying cars in the movie?  No.  Just giant robots.  Still no flying cars in 2025.  Big helicopters.  Yeah.  Personal helicopters?  That could never happen.  Eight-billion-ton fucking robots.  Fifteen helicopters, 100% in sync with each other.  Of course.  As they carry, yeah, eight-million-ton robots and drop them in the ocean. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  How much gas did that take?  Please.  The rotors would rip right off these things.  But again, I didn't care.  That wasn't the point of the movie.  Right.  And people that say it sucks balls, as they say, are missing the point of what this movie's about.  You go in.  You sit down.  You watch amazing, giant robot, fucking batshit, crazy-looking animal fights.  And Rotten Tomatoes, they're tough.  They're tough on movies. 
[00:54:30]  They're giving it 71% positive reviews.  There you go.  That's good.  That means it's a fresh tomato in their world.  That's people that know what they're going in for.  And then 85% of the moviegoers are loving it.  They know what they're going in for is why.  Yeah.  If you say it sucks balls, tell me why.  Why?  It didn't look good?  It didn't look realistic enough or anything?  It looked amazing.  All right.  We got somebody on the line.  All right.  Jeff, thanks for the compliment.  We're never going to take today because we're too busy.  I appreciate it, though.  Jeff.  Jeff?  Yeah.  How you doing today, guys? 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Hey, just wanted to call in.  First time caller.  And, uh, well, this is Truck Driver here.  And, uh, I listen to you guys religiously every morning.  Oh, wow.  Religiously.  Yeah.  Praise to us.  You guys are real.  Keep it like that, man.  I mean, you know, you guys are real.  And I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  With a cup of coffee, you guys get me through the day.  I keep it real.  Right.  I keep it real.  I keep it real. 
[00:55:30]  It's called whoop-eye.  It's called whoop-eye.  I got to put my jaw out when I do it now.  Yeah, no.  It's called whoop-eye.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right.  Right on.  But we got Kevin in Atlanta.  Oh.  Hey, uh, Anthony, you have savaged Independence Day in the past.  Yep.  Do you not realize that that movie, Pacific Rim, is nothing more than Independence Day with Transformers?  Oh, shit.  Very, very similar. 
[00:56:00]  I did notice that as I was watching last night, especially since you got the guy from The Wire  there doing his little Independence Day speech at one point.  You got the speech.  Oh, that was horrible.  It was like, worst speech of any movie.  Worst speech ever.  One of my favorite parts of the movie, as far as dialogue things go, is when someone's adamant.  And they're like, I'm not doing that.  No way you can make me.  And then someone turns around and goes, but it's for the country.  And then he goes, yeah, all right. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, what the hell?  I saw, like, three separate instances where it took nothing to talk people into doing things  that they were dead set against doing.  In one sentence, they were like, nah, right.  Nah, you're right.  When all the power goes out.  Yeah.  And it's already been established, maybe only 15 minutes ago, that the one robot, the hero  robot, has a nuclear reactor, so it's analog.  And they go, none of the robots work.  And then Charlie Hunnam goes, one does. 
[00:57:00]  One does.  Oh, shit.  I laughed out loud in the theater.  Of course you lulled.  And then guess what?  Awesome robot alien fight followed.  Fucking awesome robot alien fight.  God damn.  Well, what about the quirky scientist that just has to try to understand the aliens?  Same thing as Independence Day.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  But you know what the difference was?  What?  Independence Day did not have an alien fight literally every 15 minutes.  Exactly.  Thank you.  All right, that's true.  Thank you.  All right, Kevin. 
[00:57:30]  Nobody dragged a giant boat through Hong Kong in Independence Day.  Fucking wound up.  Wham!  He slams it with a cargo ship.  Least effective battle method ever.  Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen Pacific Rim, but I don't think they were going for high expectations  like Independence Day.  No, that also.  That's the problem with Independence Day.  They were trying to go a little more highbrow.  They meant every bit of Independence Day.  It's a Godzilla movie.  Thank you.  It's a Godzilla movie.  Wheels is saying it on Virginia.  That's what I was saying. 
[00:58:00]  From Virginia.  It reminded me of sitting there and watching Destroy All Monsters at the Central Islet movie theater.  That, yes.  With Ghidra.  Do we have that noise from Godzilla?  Godzilla noise.  Can't do it.  Oh, boy.  Now you've got to deal with Steve from Philly.  All right.  Steve in Philly.  How are you, sir?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Why the whispering? 
[00:58:30]  Are you at work already?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You at work already?  What's up?  Oh, yeah.  I'm here already.  He's calling me a golf match.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I would make golf talk, but I don't know the game, so I couldn't even make a joke.  It's a wonderful game, sir.  I just wish there was a way to figure out who the Russians were in the movie.  You know, if only we could figure out who the Russians might have been.  Maybe it was the really stoic, angry-looking, short-haired, blonde people. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, of course.  Who looked just like Ivan Drago.  And then there were the Asian guys dressed in red, and they were very Asian.  If only the Asians were really athletic and in sync.  Yes, yes.  That would be...  Of course.  They looked like the Jabberwockies.  But what?  Yeah.  But, Steve, what's your problem with any of that?  My problem, and I'll say this, the movie was very exciting.  The fight scenes were awesome.  What bothered me is all the hype they're talking about.  It's a...  Someone said it was a masterpiece. 
[00:59:30]  It was...  Man.  I thought it looked great.  When you want to see an action, when you just want to see action, and it doesn't matter  what the vehicle for that action is, if it's cornball, if it's bad dialogue or shit like  that, but the action part of it is so outrageously cool, I don't care.  As long as they pasted together some type of storyline, I could give a shit.  Well, Steve is basically saying the movie's corny.  Right.  When they cut in that junk in between... 
[01:00:00]  They cut in that junk.  The guy says...  I'm not even exaggerating.  There's about four seconds between these two things happening.  Again, Idris Elba says, if I get another machine, I'm going to die.  And within four seconds, he's in a machine.  He's back in a machine.  They really did solve problems quickly.  How about when the wacky, always sunny in Philly guy has to kind of mind meld with the brain? 
[01:00:30]  And he's on site, and just takes what looks like a giant meat thermometer.  Right.  He had his portable mind meld machine with him.  His portable mind meld machine.  It didn't matter.  He needed to talk to the brain, and they made it happen in the movie.  Not only did he build the mind meld machine out of trash, he did it twice in two different  locations with different trash.  No, I think he brought the second one, the first one, to the location somehow. 
[01:01:00]  How about when they told you what corner to meet Ron Perlman on, and they had to show  you that he was standing on the corner with the two street signs above him?  Well, yeah.  Ugh, come on.  Ron Perlman rules.  He was awesome.  He was totally awesome.  You know, I think my favorite moment was when they were like ten minutes into a fight  with an alien, and they were getting their ass kicked.  Oh, yeah.  And they were like, oh, there's only one more option, and it's to throw all our bombs 
[01:01:30]  at him.  And then the Asian girl goes, no, there's one more option.  And she pushes the button for sword.  Sword.  And I'm like, why wouldn't you have started with a sword?  Right?  Why wouldn't you have just stabbed him?  I didn't get that either.  You know, the guy's got the whirling fucking saw blade hands.  Right.  Come out with the whirling saw blade hands.  Yeah.  That's a good starter.  What was the starter then?  Just fists.  Fists.  Oh, that's the problem.  You're right. 
[01:02:00]  That's ridiculous.  Dropping double axe handles.  Right.  Like, why wouldn't you start with all your weapons?  I'd be doing that plasma gun and fucking shooting the rockets out of my chest and fucking  sword.  Not saving.  It's not even like a sword has ammunition that you save for a minute.  No.  It's a sword.  And they're just disemboweling things.  It's easy.  It looked easy.  Nice.  Yeah.  The danger was standing its ground.  Didn't want to go right to the big guns right away.  Yeah.  Look, let's stand your ground right.  Look, let's all be honest here.  It's no Sharknado. 
[01:02:30]  Okay.  Uh, yeah.  But it's still a guilty pleasure, this Pacific Rim.  Look, I fucking thought it was awesomeness.  I felt like I was watching what would happen if Sharknado had a $7 billion budget.  Yes.  And it looked, like, if Sharknado looked amazing, like, you're like, holy shit, there are really  sharks in the sky?  Right.  It would be very similar to Pacific Rim.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  When they're walking around that complex with all the robot things there, and you just 
[01:03:00]  see, like, they're coming up to barely a speck next to the shoe of this thing.  Yeah.  Like, it just looks so awesome.  Yes.  And once the government shut it all down, and this guy somehow had access to everything,  still?  Yes.  Who was funding it?  We don't need them.  The government shuts down.  They're like, look, these robots obviously aren't doing the trick anymore, so we're going  to shut down all robots and just simply build a wall.  Build a wall. 
[01:03:30]  Why would the wall be secondary to giant robots?  They're going to build a wall, which, by the way, gets breached every week.  Really?  It's just, yeah, the wall idea was terrible.  Wait a minute.  You'd start with the wall.  Yeah.  And then go, oh, the wall didn't work.  The wall doesn't work.  Let's go to robots.  We should build giant robots instead.  You'd think the wall would have been the first thing.  Like the sword.  Right.  The robots are such a bad idea that the government's going to abandon it, but if you guys want  to use them, you go ahead.  All right.  So the storyline might have a couple problems. 
[01:04:00]  He took them.  We don't have anything to do with them.  Yeah.  So if you want them, you can have them.  I know one's got a nuclear reactor in it, so be responsible.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the one that's, of course, not digital.  Right.  Because when all the digital ones shut down, the old school one that nobody wants around  is the one that saves the day.  Yeah, see?  That makes sense.  For some reason, it's impervious to an EMP.  I don't know why.  When the guy said, you're going to get us all killed, I was out.  Oh, really?  Come on. 
[01:04:30]  How were you out?  Then it went to an awesome fight.  How were you out when you got an awesome fight?  And then I put my glasses back on.  I watched the fight.  Exactly.  And then I took the glasses off.  Oh, man.  I just slowly became more and more in as the movie continued.  I did, too.  I thought it was the lowest expectations a human could have for a movie.  Yeah.  Because I was making fun of my buddy who wanted to see this.  And then I was like, all right, awesome.  That's how I was.  Awesome is what the movie was.  I go, and I'm just like, all right, awesome.  Awesome. 
[01:05:00]  When that fucking robot, when the power was like, and now they're stuck in the head,  and that big thing is just, just yelling in its face.  But it didn't attack it.  Didn't have to.  It was off.  He's playing dead.  He only plays when he's.  He sniffed at it a little.  Yeah, when you swipe at it.  He sniffed at it.  Knock it over?  No.  He didn't even knock it over.  What, all the anger just goes away because the thing powers down?  I think he was going to do something, but then fucking, you know.  He realized loftier goes. 
[01:05:30]  Gypsy showed up.  It didn't fight back.  Gypsy.  Gypsy showed up.  Steve, you're doing a great job.  Gypsy Danger showed up.  Hold on the line.  I'm going to put Mark in Nevada.  He has an observation about Pacific Rim as well.  Mark, go ahead.  You're on with Steve from Philly and, of course, us.  Okay.  How about the greatest scene of the movie when everybody thinks that a monster's dead, but  they got to turn around and check the pulse with the pulse cannon.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  What?  He turned around.  He goes, let me check the pulse.  And then he just shoots his cannons at it.  Kaboom!  Gee, gee, gee, gee.  Yeah, I don't think it's got a pulse.  Just opens it up.  Which, by the way, I love that these alien creatures that don't resemble humans in any way, shape,  or form have a pulse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you checking?  He was James Bond-type line.  Like, uh...  Are we going to be quoting lines for Pacific Rim for the rest of the summer, or...  Oh, no.  Um, no.  Steve's laughing.  I, uh, don't, uh...  Steve's like, oh, God. 
[01:06:30]  No.  No?  No.  No.  No I'll be backs or any of that shit?  No.  Oh, fuck.  Well, we might be canceling the apocalypse.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great line.  Ugh.  This is our independence day.  That's pretty much what it was.  Oh, Sam, someone's on your shit.  Hold on there, Steve.  You're still on the line, and we're going to add Kyle to the conversation.  From, uh, the home of Brother Weez, Rochester, New York.  What's up, Kyle?  Hey, Sam, as soon as you got out of that movie, you tweeted some bullshit about how it was the 
[01:07:00]  worst movie you've ever seen and all that shit.  And now you're all over Ant-Six.  No, I didn't.  Oh, you're all over Ant-Six.  As soon as I got out of the movie, I tweeted something to the effect of, if a terrible sci-fi  channel movie had a crazy big budget, it would be Pacific Rim, which is what I said  a minute ago with Sharknado.  I literally said the same thing.  And he's agreeing with me, because I'm not saying it's an amazing movie, and I said the  dialogue stinks.  You said it's awesome, though.  The fucking thing.  It's awesome.  But awesome is different than amazing. 
[01:07:30]  I thought the movie's awesome.  Which is different than great.  There were so many fights and shit, and they were placed throughout the movie where it  never got to the point where I was like, oh, jeez, enough.  Here's the two tweets.  If someone were given a huge budget to make a terrible sci-fi channel movie, it would be  Pacific Rim, which is an endorsement.  Ah, see?  Second one, Pacific Rim is maybe the funniest movie of the summer.  You have to be prepared for absolute ridiculousness.  Yes.  It's great. 
[01:08:00]  And once you're prepared for that, you go in and you're like, fucking awesome.  And then I sighted the robot dragging a boat through Hong Kong.  Yes.  I got a tweet.  You know, kink.  Now that Steve from Philly is kind of a star, he's helping us through the segment here,  now he gets to have the fun of the hater.  Oh, good.  Tell this queer Steve on the phone to stay in the art house theater if you want cinematic  excellence.  Fuck off, douchebag.  Fuck off, douchebag is queer.  Welcome to showbiz, sir.  Yeah.  Enjoy. 
[01:08:30]  Enjoy.  Aren't they a treat?  Hope you like your fans.  Right.  My problem with it was the hype, not the actual hype.  It wasn't much hype.  It wasn't.  No, this wasn't hyped.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about like the phony reviewers that they put on the commercials.  Well, who doesn't do that?  I got a question.  Yeah.  Was Tom Skerritt in the movie or what?  No.  Fuck!  That would be great.  How do you make a movie like that without Tom Skerritt? 
[01:09:00]  I didn't know.  Although we finally get Tom Skerritt on the phone and then someone in studio didn't have  a lot to say to the guy.  Eh, who were you going to say to Tom Skerritt?  You didn't mention homosexuality.  Homo eroticism in Top Gun, which he just laughed at me about.  Oh, we got him on the phone because of you.  I know.  And then you had not much to say to the guy.  I really thought I'd have more to say to Tom Skerritt, and I kind of didn't.  When did you realize you didn't have much to say to Tom Skerritt?  Pretty early on in the conversation, I was like, ah. 
[01:09:30]  I was just obsessed at how much he sounded like Clint Eastwood from Play Misty for me.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just looking at Mount Rainier.  Right, writing some.  Writing some poetry.  Yeah.  For my radio show.  All right, Steve and Philly, you did a great job today, sir.  We should eat.  My eggs are getting cold.  Missing a huge point.  It's a lot like Twister.  Another guy wants to defend Pacific Rim.  Let me go to Ken as you open up your breakfast there. 
[01:10:00]  Ken, what's going on?  Queens.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Yeah, Pacific Rim was an awesome monster movie.  Yeah.  Like, if you watch Godzilla and you're like, oh my God, what could they do today with all the special effects?  Exactly.  Thank you.  That's what they did.  The star of the movie, everyone's comparing it to Independence Day.  No, it's not like, there's no Will Smith.  There's no mega star in it.  The stars are the robots and the monsters.  Yep.  It's great.  You have to go in there, you know, and watch. 
[01:10:30]  It's a good action flick.  You just sit there, you know, you watch it.  You don't expect dialogue.  Like, all the monster movies, the dialogue is, you know, a little corny anyway.  Exactly.  Yeah, you laugh at it.  You're supposed to laugh at it.  The guy from What's-His-Face, from Sons of Anarchy, he's like the, what is he, the black market guy.  He's corny in it with the little knife.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a great movie. 
[01:11:00]  I love that.  You're not going to waste your money by going there and watching this movie.  All right.  Five stars.  Thank you, Ken.  What was I going to say?  Oh, if you didn't see it in 3D, would it be just as awesome?  Yeah, I didn't see it in 3D.  Oh, really?  It was fucking badass.  I think you sold me on this.  I had no desire to see Pacific Rim, even though I love Charlie Day, but now I might have to go.  It couldn't be more stupid, but it also couldn't be more awesome.  Fucking the power in those punches that they're showing. 
[01:11:30]  Like, whoever did the CGI on this shit was fucking brilliant.  Speaking of movies, before we take a break, the sequel to Sharknado has been announced, and it's going to take place in New York City.  I want to start a campaign.  I want this radio show in the next Sharknado movie.  How do we do this?  Yes.  I want to be eaten by a flying shark.  How does this happen?  Wow.  How do we do this?  I don't know.  It seems reasonable.  I mean, look who they had in the other one. 
[01:12:00]  Ian Ziering, big stars.  Right.  Can we start a campaign?  Who do we reach out to?  I just want a stupid cameo.  How do we even need a line?  How about we're just doing our radio show and a shark comes through the ceiling and eats us?  That would be crazy.  That's right.  Maybe we'll try to get the dad from Home Alone to be a guest on the show.  He's probably not doing anything.  He'll get us that connection.  You know, there's another Home Alone.  He's not going to be in that one.  Yeah, but he probably still knows the people.  That's true.  You know, speaking of Home Alone, there's another alumni that's doing very, very well. 
[01:12:30]  Who's that?  Joe Pesci?  Devin.  No way.  Remember Devin, our old pal?  Devin Ritray.  Who kind of gave up on us because we were obsessed about the fact that his father was  in a porno.  He just didn't want us talking about it anymore.  Not even a porno.  What, like a hard R?  Yeah, one of those old lady...  Used to see it.  Lady Chatterley's lover.  Yeah, I think he was in one of those.  He used to see it back on cable when cable first came out. 
[01:13:00]  But I never gave up on Devin, who was in Home Alone and was a friend of the show for a while.  So, when Jeff Bridges was in the other day, Jeff Bridges gave us, me and Jimmy, a book  of his photography.  One of Jeff Bridges' hobbies is to kind of take photos when he's on set of what's going  on.  And I'm going through this book.  It's kind of cool.  And all of a sudden, I see Devin.  He's in the new movie.  He's in R.I.P.D.  Whoa.  I'm like, right on Devin.  Wow.  Very happy for him. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know how big his part is, but...  Yeah, he's in it.  He's absolutely in the movie.  He's working.  So, a little shout out to Devin.  Go find him.  If he's still out there listening or fucking whatever.  All right.  Very cool.  On the cover of The Rolling Stone.  We should talk about that a little bit, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people are confused.  Cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yes! 
[01:14:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  Go on.  Sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Na-na-na-na-na.  Na-na-na-na-na.  Na-na-na-na-na-na. 
[01:14:30]  Bo-o-o-o.  Oh, Nelson Mandela at 95 today.  I am.  He's got a little bit of a comeback.  I know.  It looked like he was definitely going to be dropping dead.  He was on his deathbed, and then I heard, I think, a few days ago,  they were considering letting him go home.  Yeah.  I guess he had an...  Not that he's going to be playing tennis or anything, but they're thinking, 
[01:15:00]  ah, go home, enjoy the rest of your life.  I just can't clear this fucking throat, man.  It's fucking driving me insane.  It is a bad one as far as the throat and the mucus-y...  I don't feel sick.  ...thing goes.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't feel sick or any of that shit.  Yeah, I'm fine now.  It's just like this weird little, just this fucking dry tickle.  Yep.  My voice was gone for the past few days.  Today's the first day, like, I don't feel like I'm completely...  Right, right.  A little ratty. 
[01:15:30]  Na-na-na-na-na.  At least it was a fast one.  Like, this one is like this fast-moving virus or whatever it is.  So the cover of Rolling Stone, everyone's talking about it.  Yes.  With the Boston Bomber kid.  Oh, I thought that was one of the Jonas Brothers.  Ugh.  Oh.  It's been four months and I still can't pronounce the kid's name.  I'll acknowledge that.  Boston Bomber.  Boston Bomber.  Boston Bomber.  And there's a lot of outrage. 
[01:16:00]  And a lot of my outrage goes toward the mainstream media because, like I was telling Anthony this morning, I would have never seen this cover if it wasn't plastered on every news program.  Yeah, yeah.  And it confuses the fuck out of me because, okay, Rolling Stone has the controversial, you know, cover and it's pissing off a lot of people, obviously.  Uh-huh.  But then the news shows it and they try to say they're just doing the news, but they're turning more people onto the controversial cover. 
[01:16:30]  Mm, yeah.  And then they have this, like, this fake outrage, this false outrage, like, can you believe what Rolling Stone is doing?  And I'm thinking to myself, you're showing millions of people this cover that would probably have never seen the damn cover.  Because, first of all, who reads Rolling Stone anymore?  Yeah.  Their numbers are way the fuck down.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you got, I got problems with Rolling Stone, obviously, because, okay, you want to do a cover story on this kid, and I hear that the article itself is well written. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of, like, what the fuck?  And no one expected that this kid would have done what he did.  And they'd talk to his old wrestling coach and this and that and give a history of the kid himself.  So I understand, especially with the freedom of speech and freedom of the press and all that, that something like this should be allowed.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  But then Rolling Stone chooses to put, you know, the kid on the cover like he's Jim Morrison or like he's in one of these new hip bands of the day.  Exactly.  Instead of maybe choosing a picture where maybe it's an overall picture of, you know, the bomb going off.  You know what I mean?  Or one of those grainy pictures of him from a surveillance video.  Right.  Yeah.  Anything but something that makes him look like a rock star.  Which, again, plays into the minds of all these lunatics that go on these mass shootings and bombings and whatnot. 
[01:18:00]  And they look at that and go, well, this guy reached the pinnacle of fucking existence.  A picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.  All I got to do is, and now, you know, go out and kill somebody.  And it's always been a thing, you know.  There's been songs written about it on the cover of the Rolling Stone.  Yeah, yeah.  Like every band is hoping, even the cool bands, they're all hoping that one day they're on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.  And they put this kid on there looking, like you said, like a rock star. 
[01:18:30]  It's like we were talking about with the news, covering these guys' manifestos and everything.  It makes the next person want to do it that much more because they're doing it for nothing more than recognition.  Sure.  For their cause or for themselves or what have you.  So now it's like, oh, wow, this guy, this guy really got recognition.  Right.  He's all over the news.  His picture now.  And they didn't have to use that shot.  They could have, look at what they did to Manson, because they also had Manson, Charles Manson on the cover years ago. 
[01:19:00]  But look what they did.  They made it black and white.  They put some kind of yellow around his circle around his face or most of his face.  Yeah.  He looks very scary.  Right.  Like, they didn't have to give this kid the fucking rock star treatment.  Yeah.  That's just as good a picture as any fucking rock star you would see on the cover.  Oh, absolutely.  Any rock star would be proud of that type of picture on the cover of Rolling Stone.  So, you know, I mean, we live in a society where, yeah, you got to kind of allow it. 
[01:19:30]  But, yeah, but you also got to look at what the motive is there.  Right.  I mean, there are girls that love this kid, that fucking are writing letters, protesting that they should free him, pictures of him up on their walls.  Right.  And the type of hero worship for this animal is fucked up.  Then for Rolling Stone to do this and make it even more so. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  Is, you know, what's the intent?  And I'm bothered by the news because, like, it's weird.  It's sort of a gray area because, yeah, obviously they want to report on things happening in our society.  But to make believe that they're part of the outrage is ridiculous because you are turning more people on to the outrage.  Yeah.  It drives me nuts when I see these people do it.  And they show the cover every half hour. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, it's up there all the time.  I've already seen it at least ten times as we're doing a radio show and goofing on Pacific Rim.  I'm like, there's the cover again.  Seriously?  I would not have seen the cover.  Yeah.  Because I don't really buy magazines anymore.  I walk by a magazine stand, so maybe I would have saw it quickly.  Maybe.  Maybe it would have caught my eye.  And Brooke Baldwin, she's one of the newsreaders on CNN.  Because they're pretty much newsreaders, let's be honest with each other.  They try to have an opinion here and there, but it falls incredibly short. 
[01:21:00]  And she had a Boston fireman on, talking about the cover.  Because obviously up there, man, it really fucking stinks.  And he's talking about it and just saying how pissed off he is and all the typical stuff, of course.  And then goes in.  The media then celebrates the fact that he's on the cover of Rolling Stone.  And Brooke Baldwin gets on her high horse.  Sir, we're just reporting the news.  But you could tell she was bothered by that, because I think deep down in her tiny little fucking pea brain, she knows what she's doing. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  But she doesn't want to lose her job, so she plays her part in the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  Of course the media is celebrating the fact that this kid is on the cover of Rolling Stone.  They know what they're fucking doing.  But they figure if they go, oh, look how outrageous this is, then they could certainly talk about it and feel safe.  I mean, they must have meetings.  The Rolling Stone's been around long enough where they must have meetings about the cover.  And then they must also have discussions as to whether any of their covers is going to cause a problem. 
[01:22:00]  And how to, you know, head it off.  So they must have known.  I...  I...  I...  Oh, my God.  Did you see this?  Yes, yes.  What do people hear when we talk?  Oh, my God.  Tony, Dallas, what's up?  Yeah, he hung up.  He was so scared.  He goes, that's an old picture.  They didn't do a photo shoot.  It wasn't part of a photo shoot. 
[01:22:30]  Really?  I didn't know.  I didn't see the trach hole in his throat.  Right.  And his jaw fucking three inches over to the side and bullet holes in his face.  Yeah, that kind of led me to believe it wasn't taken ex post facto.  Is that how he looks nowadays?  Yeah, from what I see.  That's why Rolling Stone, you know, to get a picture where he was all...  Get him all fucked up.  All sexy and shit.  Yeah.  You know, that's...  I don't know.  I...  Rolling Stone could do whatever the fuck they want, but I wish they would have, like, picked  a different fucking, you know, picture to sell their story. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  So.  But, of course, you gotta allow it.  Well, yeah.  You know, it...  I don't think anything can be done.  I mean, what?  CVS has decided they're not gonna...  Right in.  ...carry the magazine and...  A whole bunch of places.  And I guess that's their, you know, prerogative.  But Rolling Stone doesn't care.  They'll have it online.  Yeah.  You know, they did their job.  They got everyone talking about Rolling Stone magazine. 
[01:23:30]  When was the last time anyone talked about Rolling Stone magazine?  A long fucking time ago.  So they're probably high-fiving all over the fucking office.  Yeah.  Which is really close to here, by the way.  I think it's only a couple blocks up on 6th Avenue.  I can't believe that guy thought we would even think it was a photo shoot.  Like, they, like, you know, let the FBI know.  Hey, could we take this kid into a studio?  We're doing a cover, right?  And we want to get the sexiest shot we can.  Yeah, sure.  Have him back a little later, though. 
[01:24:00]  You know, we're gonna charge him with, you know, murder and...  Yeah, we got 800 counts that we gotta charge him with.  But, yes.  Use of a weapon of mass destruction.  But I think we could give you a couple hours for the photo shoot in a warehouse somewhere.  You know, yeah, go ahead, go ahead.  That guy was a dope.  Let's say hi to Terry.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, everybody fucking knew it, Rolling Stone, because everybody's seen the movie Almost Famous. 
[01:24:30]  They sit down and discuss all the covers and what's gonna go into it.  They have reporters go out and actually take care of what's going on, you know?  It's very calculated.  Yeah, of course it is.  They knew exactly what they were doing.  They knew they would get people talking.  This wasn't a mistake.  Oh, no, no, no.  And if they say...  And I think one of their excuses was...  Hey, I love this show, guys.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Terry.  Long-time listener.  I appreciate it, actually.  Thanks.  No, long-time talker, apparently.  What were you saying?  Non-existent listener. 
[01:25:00]  Um, and they were saying one of their excuses was this was the only photo that was available  or one of the few photos that was available of him.  Well, you could fuck things up with a little contrast, take the color saturation out of it.  Oh, no.  Something.  But they went to the effort of making him look like a Jonas brother.  Right.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Yeah, there was a lot of things they could have done.  The guy will also be in Time magazine. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  Ah, let's say hi to Pooner.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Pooner.  Yeah, I mean, think about it.  Eventually, he's going to wind up...  If not him, it's going to be a toss-up between him and Zimmerman, right?  For what?  Man of the Year?  Yeah, you know, they put...  No, Man of the Year.  They've put some crazy people on that cover.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you find the Man of the Year covers, Sam, real fast?  Hitler.  There you go.  And, uh...  Was Hitler Man of the Year officially?  Osama Bin Laden?  Osama Bin Laden, maybe? 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  I'm grabbing gears, guys.  Appreciate you putting me on that.  All right, brother.  Gears.  All right, man.  Wow.  I wonder if he'll get his name in the National Geographic.  Yeah, man, there it is.  The difference with putting him on time, though.  Oh, Travis.  Hi, Travis.  How are you?  Okay, how are you?  Good.  I enjoyed our Pearl Jam discussion yesterday.  You did?  Yeah, of course I did.  People didn't.  Well, you know what?  Those people...  Because they say we do that one a lot.  I don't think so.  I don't think enough.  Oh, boy. 
[01:26:30]  I mean...  By the way, Coke Logic was really mad.  Not mad.  I know.  I was texting back.  Oh, he wrote you, too?  He's like, hey, just want to let you know Pearl Jam never covered Behind Blue Eyes, but  Eddie Vedder did.  Here's the file.  Oh, Jesus.  We're file sharing.  I just want to let you know before I send the file to Opie.  I kind of knew, to be honest with you.  I kind of knew.  And does it really matter if it's Pearl Jam or Eddie Vedder doing the cover?  No.  Hey, can we play that into break?  Let me see if I can find it.  Please. 
[01:27:00]  Because I love Behind Blue Eyes.  It makes sense, because we were talking about it yesterday.  Fuck it.  Yeah, and then we can talk about Pearl Jam.  All right.  What do you got, Chase?  I was just going to say that it's different to put him on the cover of Time Magazine, which  is a news magazine, than to put it on the cover of a magazine that's clearly geared  towards teenagers and 20-somethings.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a music entertainment politics.  The last time we were talking about a Rolling Stone cover was what?  Britney Spears?  Yeah.  God, I don't even know.  And they do cover political issues in Rolling Stone. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, but it's not on the cover.  It's the way they presented it.  It's the picture.  And the way it's done is you cannot distinguish that picture from any of the rock star pictures  they've...  I would love to look that good.  Let's be honest with each other.  Right?  Holy fuck.  I would love that.  Even if they said really shitty things about us.  Exactly.  I would love that.  Right?  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  If we look like rock stars and we're on the cover of Rolling Stone, but the title says 
[01:28:00]  The Biggest Douchebags in New York, I would be excited.  I would send a copy to every family member.  Exactly.  Goddamn.  Well...  Yeah, the world is crazy.  We all know that.  We're in bizarro world, definitely.  Hey, Travis, while you're still on the mic there, rock the mic.  I'll be here for the next two days.  Oh, E-Rock's missing in action.  Where's E-Rock?  Mysteriously absent.  Oh, I wish we knew.  Oh. 
[01:28:30]  For the foreseeable future?  We don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know for sure.  He had to take a couple days, and then he was asked if he'd be back Monday, and he said,  I'm not really sure.  No, we didn't.  We asked him in the meeting if he was going to be available for Montreal, and he's like,  I hope so.  Yeah, he's so mysterious.  What is he doing?  And he also wouldn't tell anybody where he was going.  He's very shady.  What's with him?  I don't know.  Probably another cruise, right?  I don't know, but then, like...  He's probably just got some family stuff he's taking care of that's, like, not that big 
[01:29:00]  a deal.  And then when he finally tells you, you're like, really?  All the mystery over that?  Exactly.  But this might be a real thing.  That's the problem.  And if it is a real thing, then we're like, all right, but all the other times, it wasn't  a real thing when you were mysterious.  He's one of those guys.  He is one of those guys.  There could be two of those guys.  Because he's big.  Even if it is a real thing, you just say what it is privately and say, oh, yeah, I got some  shit I have to deal with, my whatever has whatever, I got to do that. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, okay.  Did he seem upset when you were asking him?  He seemed vague and mysterious.  Maybe he just wants to sit down and hammer out that script.  Maybe.  You know, without any distractions.  Yeah.  Flew off to Hollywood?  The movie.  Maybe he's trying to sell it.  Maybe it's done.  He's got his treatment and he's out there pounding the pavement.  All right.  Yeah.  Could be.  Literally pounding the pavement.  He's out there cracking the pavement.  Making potholes.  Making potholes.  Just walking a lunch.  He'll have a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, even if he has to just make it himself. 
[01:30:00]  Making it himself.  Look, if Sharknado can't get me and Anne in the sequel, that's going to be based in New  York City.  At least get E-Rock.  Yeah.  As one of the Sharks.  Whale-nado.  Poor E-Rock.  You got an update on the kid that ran on the field at the All-Star game?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The article's titled, Twiddly Dumb Son. 
[01:30:30]  He fucked up.  And he looks like a dumb kid.  I love this kid.  Mom and dad in shock over All-Star Stunt.  You know, he's another guy.  He's playing his part.  They got a picture of him leaving court.  Yeah.  And his head is down like he has regrets.  Yeah.  But he doesn't have any regrets.  No, he loves it.  He fucking loves it.  That he got all that attention.  And his mom's smirking like, Jesus Christ.  Is his mom hot?  I haven't...  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, her shelf life probably just ended. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, but...  You can still take it home if you eat it quick enough.  You can still get a couple shots out of it.  Dad obviously doesn't follow his son's tweets.  Mom and dad in shock over All-Star Stunt.  But the All-Star Airhead, who stormed Citi Field on a Twitter dare, his father had no idea  about the stunt until he looked up and saw his son, whom he sent to the concession stands  trying to run the bases.  Oh, man. 
[01:31:30]  What a dummy.  He tells his son to go get some hot dogs or whatever.  And then the father, assuming that his son is at the concession stands, he looks up to  see his son on the field trying to run the bases.  I love it.  The field's right there.  I could just jump out there and run around.  What he didn't know was that Dylan had told followers that he would run on the field during  Tuesday night's All-Star Game if he got 1,000 retweets.  I gave him 20 bucks, the father said, to get some food.  Who's a supermarket manager, by the way. 
[01:32:00]  Ten minutes later, I saw him running across the field.  Then I said to my brother, that's Dylan.  Then I thought, my wife is going to kill me.  That mother is brutal.  Because that's what the kid was upset about.  Everyone's worried about the mom.  Worried about the mom.  Indeed, the teen's mom, Chris, who had been tipped off to the tweets, texted her son warning  him not to do it.  At first, I thought it was funny that he'd be doing this.  Then I texted him and told him not to do it because he could get arrested, said the worried  mother who turned into the game at the family's Long Island home. 
[01:32:30]  Long Island, of course.  I was at home watching the game when they announced a fan on the field.  They did not show my son.  He was released on his own reconnaissance.  I'm just trying to get through this, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, he's crazy.  What can I say, Johnson tweeted yesterday.  Time is going so slow, I just want to see my animal of a boyfriend. 
[01:33:00]  What?  What?  Among the followers who egged him on was his girlfriend, Healy Johnson, who kept the masses  entertained while her social media stunt stooge stewed in the slammer.  They have to get those long, drawn-out bylines.  Okay, and then she wrote or tweeted, yeah, he's crazy.  What can I say?  Time is going so slow, I just want to see my animal of a boyfriend.  Oh, okay. 
[01:33:30]  Before the prank, Johnson tweeted that she would marry this kid if he ran on the field.  A couple of innings later, she tweeted, me and him are officially over.  What?  She insists she was joking.  I just love that story.  I think it's great.  I like the picture really sums it up to a very young, dopey teen with his mommy.  His mommy taking him home.  Leaving court.  Bailing him out.  Let's say hi to Tracy in Boston. 
[01:34:00]  Tracy.  Hi.  Hey.  The only reason why he's on the cover is because of his looks.  If he was this timply fat kid, they never would have put him on the cover.  And let's say the new town shooter was a good-looking guy.  They would have put him on the cover.  They, yeah, they know that the girls have been swooning over this animal.  Yeah.  So they put him on the cover, yeah.  I went out to the courthouse when they brought him down and they had, you know, these vapid, 
[01:34:30]  you know, 12-year-old girls saying, he's innocent, he's innocent.  He's innocent.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  You know, I had Janet written a piece that did, like, a juxtaposition between Sean Collier.  You know, both of them are kind of the same age.  Both of them started out good, supposedly, and then one went one way, one went the other  way.  It might have been.  She's talking about the Glee kid.  Yeah.  Who's not a kid anymore.  Wasn't he pushing, like, 30 years old or something? 
[01:35:00]  30.  Yeah.  Now he's doing heroin.  I won't get to you, needy.  Jesus Christ.  What are you doing?  What?  We'll get to you.  That's why I just standing out.  I went high like that.  That's high.  We're doing a show.  So am I supposed to?  Don't act like all of a sudden you're doing this.  Sam.  What?  Did you see what I saw?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Obviously, we're in the middle of something.  I was stretching.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I was stretching.  A minute ago, he was saying hi. 
[01:35:30]  I was saying hi.  Were you saying hi or stretching?  What was it?  Look at my sciatica.  I'm in so much fucking pain.  We'll talk about that later.  Oh, my God.  But I didn't mean to interrupt.  I knew you would get to me.  I thought you looked like, what are you doing out there?  Come on in.  That's what I thought it looked like.  I didn't mean to interrupt everything.  His body language said, hello, I'm here.  Oh, now you're a body language reader.  I just said.  Sam.  What?  Okay, maybe.  I don't want to get off on the wrong note.  On the wrong note.  No, it's all good.  I don't care in the end.  You actually called it yesterday. 
[01:36:00]  What?  Yeah.  What did he say?  He talked about me yesterday?  He said, no matter what time you tell Rich to show up, he'll show up early and then stand  in front of the glass and stare in, stare at it and stretch until we call him in.  No, here's something.  It was exactly what it just happened.  Thank you.  No, what happened?  And I don't care.  Trust me.  I don't care.  I know you guys.  Listen.  You're not going to win this one.  No, I know.  But you don't care about anything.  So that's why I know you don't care about this.  That's our motto.  We don't care and it shows.  But I try to beat traffic.  That's why I get here. 
[01:36:30]  I get the whole thing.  You get it?  Yes.  Okay.  So I'm listening.  No, sit down.  It doesn't matter that much.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  Now take a seat.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  What are you looking at?  Real tattoos?  He's just showing off his tattoo.  That's why I did the whole life.  Wait, you got another tattoo?  Well, I had this one.  No, that was from the show, right?  Yeah, but they just did it over.  Again, they did it over?  Not them, my new guy.  Wait, the tattoo.  Wait, all right.  You went on worst tattoo, whatever the fuck the show was, that they're showing over and  over again.  Yeah.  But this guy brought it to another level. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I know.  But I thought we saw that one already.  Yeah, but it just didn't come out the way I liked it.  So he touched it up again.  Yesterday.  And then he did.  Okay.  And then he got a new one?  What's wrong with you?  Immortal Ink in Flemington.  This is a pinup girl with a golf club.  You know that's pretty fucking hot.  Oh, my God.  Immortal Ink in Flemington.  The guy fucking Josh is a magic guy.  What, you don't like?  I just...  I don't...  No, believe me.  My brother's got fucking shitload of tats, too.  I'm just not a tat guy.  Did you notice that when you were showering with him when you were a kid? 
[01:37:30]  No, Rich.  He didn't have him at that young age.  Oh, you didn't have him then?  That's a big piece, though.  What, this one?  Man, you guys that get the big pieces, you're fucking brave.  I can't even imagine putting a big tattoo on my body.  And it's inside of the forearm.  This one came out really good.  Both of them.  This guy fucking is like a magic guy.  Yeah, but why does it look like that tattoo is slipping down your shoulder?  Shouldn't it have been higher?  I'm going to do more higher.  Right?  Yeah, no.  It's going to go up higher.  It's going to go... 
[01:38:00]  Oh, boy.  What's that?  That's Joe DeRose's...  Joe DeRose?  Oh, good.  Now, did he have...  What did he have done to that that was...  Wait, you weren't here?  No.  Dude, we killed him for an hour.  Hold on.  There's too much going on.  Hold on.  I got...  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  Is Tracy gone?  All right, she's gone.  We're talking about the Rolling Stone cover as well.  We'll get back to that.  You weren't here.  Dude, he got fucking beat up.  Oh, we killed him at the show.  But it's the famous George Carlin quote that basically Carlin said to everybody. 
[01:38:30]  Even E-Rock has a signed picture where George Carlin wrote the same thing.  No way.  Oh, you missed it all.  Is it going to be on the countdown this weekend?  Absolutely.  I'm going to have to listen to the countdown.  100%.  Kick them...  Keep kicking them in the nuts.  And Joe thought it was like, oh, my God, he's talking to me personally, so I have to put...  You know all this?  I know that.  Okay.  Then the other thing...  Hold on.  And then what made it hilarious, E-Rock...  E-Rock had it.  He texted me a picture that he had George Carlin sign, and it's a George Carlin headshot. 
[01:39:00]  And he wrote, kick him in the nuts.  The only part he didn't say was, keep kicking him in the nuts.  He just wrote, kick him in the nuts, George Carlin.  The other thing was, we had always thought that Carlin had said that to him face to face.  Joe called into his friend's college radio show that George Carlin was on,  and Carlin told him, keep kicking him in the nuts over the phone of the radio show.  I wish Carlin would have said to him, kill yourself. 
[01:39:30]  So the tattoo would be KY.  So it gets better.  So George Carlin, for the people that don't know, keep kicking them in the nuts.  So he abbreviated it.  So his tattoo was K-K-T-I-T-N.  And then what drives Jim Norton crazy, the period at the end.  He actually tattooed a period on.  So Joe says that he did this horrendous cover-up job, as we're all looking at now.  It's on Not Sam's, what, Instagram or Twitter?  Why did he do that?  Because it just had your initials before this box is around it. 
[01:40:00]  He says...  That fucking box looks horrible.  He says that when he was walking around, he would get some looks from black guys.  And he was thinking that the black guys might think it's a KKK tattoo.  Because it's 1K away from KKK, obviously.  So that frees him out.  Huh?  Yeah, but all the other letters, aren't the black guys going to put that together?  No, but he thought that it looked too much like...  Incursive, apparently.  Like KKK.  They're impervious to being red. 
[01:40:30]  Like a white supremacist-type tattoo.  So he went in and got that ridiculous cover-up.  That's not a box, though, Voss.  What do you think that is?  Yeah, I see something...  Oh, hold on, before we go into that stage and what we talked about.  Then this hot piece of ass comes in.  Some Latino broad that does a sports blog for an L.A. station,  but obviously she's here interviewing or something.  We saw her walking, so we bring her in while we're talking about the bad tattoo.  So we go, all right, no one's saying anything.  We ask this hot broad, what does the tattoo look like? 
[01:41:00]  She goes, kitty?  Which we've all said.  We've all said, why would you have kitten fucking tattooed on your arm?  Because if you look at it quickly, it looks like kitten.  She goes, it looks like kitty?  It was a huge laugh.  Oh, my God.  So anyway, he does that cover-up.  What is it supposed to be, Rich Voss?  That looks like a cigarette.  Everyone says it looks like a cigarette.  I mean, it looks like...  Do you know what it is?  I'm going to...  No, I don't know, but I'm going to assume I know what it is.  I think I do.  What's that?  Just because I kind of know what he was probably going for being a comic. 
[01:41:30]  A lot of people online are saying electric razor.  Yeah, yeah.  Why does that...  I'm going to say microphone.  No, it doesn't even...  Are you kidding me?  It doesn't look like one.  What kind of microphone?  A microphone flashlight?  It does for the fact that there's the windscreen thing,  but was it supposed to be a microphone?  It was.  Because then he would have a cord coming from there.  No, that's not a microphone.  It is a microphone.  It is a microphone.  What clubs does he work?  That's the worst fucking microphone. 
[01:42:00]  My kid has a better microphone.  But he needs that taking care.  He needs to go to somebody that can completely cover that  and just fucking get rid of it.  And he showed, on the after show, after you left,  he showed a photo of what the artist had originally intended to do,  which was take the initials and just add some, like, yellow designs  and stuff under it, and it actually looked good.  And Joe said, no, no, no, that's too much, that's too much.  This was Joe's idea.  Okay.  If he was...  Listen, I'm not plugging this guy at Immortal Inc., this guy, Josh,  but even if you don't like tattoos, this is a good fucking piece. 
[01:42:30]  I see that as a good piece.  I would never have that on my arm.  Okay.  Now, and this...  What does Bobby think of your big tattoos?  Of course he hates it.  She loves this new one, how he picks it up.  Because, yeah, when the girl did the other one,  it just kind of looked like a big blob, but now...  No, it looks good.  Now it looks...  As far as tattoos go, you've got some good pieces.  But the thing she doesn't like about this,  this is a pin-up girl with a golf club, for people that don't know.  Is it an actual pin-up girl?  Yeah, you know, you just like a pin-up girl, like, you know,  the style from old school, which I like old school stuff. 
[01:43:00]  And she said, well, why would you put a girl on your arm?  I'm going, well, she's really a fictitious girl.  If you had, like, you know, a sailor that wasn't a real sailor,  I don't think I'd give a fuck.  And she goes, you know, well, you know, you're married.  Why would you put another girl on your arm?  And the bottom line is, you know, when I'm fucking her,  I can look at this girl to stay hard.  No, it's not...  It's nothing.  It's just like a...  Girls get bothered by that?  When a guy gets a girl tattoo on?  I never knew that. 
[01:43:30]  The other arm, I had the other girl swing in the club.  Right.  A nice one.  I could see if the girl tattoo was maybe a portrait.  Your wife or girlfriend would be like, what the fuck?  But it's like, it's cartoony.  Yeah, it's a pin-up girl.  Yeah.  Look, look.  The style's cartoony, though.  I would love to talk to Rich about his tats.  What happened?  But I can't get over this fucking...  I'm looking at the picture.  Was there a period after every letter?  No, just after N.  You've seen his tattoo? 
[01:44:00]  I know.  I can't remember, though.  Oh, okay.  That doesn't make any sense.  I know.  Why a period after...  He wanted to just...  Because the period after the N goes to say,  keep kicking them in the nuts is a sentence.  Yeah.  So then the period, he thought that adding this box that he calls a microphone around it  would soften it so people wouldn't think he's racist anymore.  Well, you know, here's the thing.  If I didn't know any better, I would think he's in a black fraternity.  Because those guys brand it.  Yeah, brand it.  It looks like a brand it.  Well, I think...  I'm kind of glad that Carrot Top's not his favorite act, 
[01:44:30]  because then he'd have all these little props all over his arm,  like teddy bears and shit.  Okay, they're not all great.  But what I'm saying, you know...  And I'm not going to trick us.  He likes my...  I'm a big fan of Joe, but he's out of his fucking mind.  I love Joe.  He's hilarious.  I'll tell you what he did with you.  You had a party or a barbecue around 4th of July.  And I wanted to call you so bad.  I forgot to do this.  He calls me and says,  Look, you know, I'm going to Ann's house, 
[01:45:00]  and I'm going to bring a friend.  What do you think?  Do you think Ann would care?  I go, Ann wouldn't fucking care  if you brought a militia group.  True.  I'd like a militia.  I mean, that one guy, you're not going to camp.  No, no.  Okay?  And he was like...  I go, look, just bring a fucking bottle or some food,  and whatever.  It's like a party.  Just bring some.  But I wanted to call you,  and I forgot to do it,  like, when Joe got there,  like a half an hour later,  for you to pull him to the side and say,  Look, you're going to have to get this guy out of here. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, what are you doing?  Oh, that would have been good.  You would have freaked out.  Yeah, Joe would have freaked out at that.  He's one of my favorite people,  but, you know,  that whole tattoo can be covered perfectly.  It's got to be covered.  It's got to be covered.  I'm sorry,  and I'm not getting on Joe about,  you know,  people make mistakes in life.  Holy shit.  It's horrible.  He's fucked up real bad.  Does he have...  Well, he thought it was awesome.  Was he sitting here going, 
[01:46:00]  Dude, check it out.  I think he's going crazy.  He has a new tattoo that's equally as bad.  What?  Team Zimmerman?  We think it's a Ghostbuster thing.  Oh, he had that.  Oh, he had the red one.  He had that.  Now it's black.  Now it's black.  And it's horrible.  I think it's the Ghostbusters.  They look like they were done with a pin and ink,  like in prison.  Well, the one I wanted to get Bonnie yelled at me,  I might have brought this up on the air last time I was here.  I wanted to get a microphone,  a real mic, 
[01:46:30]  with a cord,  strangling a girl in the front row,  saying,  It's not about you, bitch.  Right?  But Bonnie goes,  Is that what you want your audience to see?  How you feel about them?  But you really wanted this tattoo?  Yeah.  I wanted it so bad.  Just a fucking...  That's hilarious.  But to even think you would actually do that is even better.  An angry mic,  just the cord strangling something.  That's funny.  That's good.  And she's like,  you know...  But they wouldn't see that.  Huh?  They wouldn't see it. 
[01:47:00]  See, I'm getting these tattoos for...  I'm doing a show...  I'm trading a show for this guy.  He's having, like, some outdoor hot rod.  You love this shit.  He's having a big hot rod show.  Bikers, hot rods.  So I'm going to host...  I'm not a big hot rod guy.  I like driving fast, but...  I'm going to host the event.  You know,  it's a Sunday afternoon.  And, you know,  we're trading for tattoos.  It's called barter.  That's what the whole country's coming down to,  is barter.  You didn't know that.  No, I didn't.  Because if the value of the dollar is dropping, 
[01:47:30]  the value of gold,  everything's dropping,  so it's going to barter.  Bill Devane tells me I should buy gold.  That's right.  His father told him to buy land,  and he did.  And he did very well for himself.  Yep.  Who's he?  Oh, boy.  Who is he?  You really need to know who he is.  Bill Devane?  Yeah.  By the way,  for the people out there,  that I didn't...  Yeah,  it's not the Glee guy.  I just threw that out there.  I don't know who Sean Collier is,  or whatever the fuck.  Who is he?  Collier.  Who is he?  I don't know.  People are obsessed.  They're like,  that's not the Glee guy.  Yeah, I know that. 
[01:48:00]  I just threw that out there.  I had no idea.  I had no idea.  I don't know the name of the Glee guy  who overdosed,  and I don't know who Sean Collier is.  He's a hockey player.  Well, the Glee guy that overdosed...  So why was he mentioned in Tracy's phone call?  I guess he came up around the same time  as the Boston Bomber?  I don't know.  Exactly!  So I said,  yeah, that's the Glee guy.  It was a throwaway stupid thing, I said.  Do you want to get George on the phone  and I'll talk to him  and I'll get him a cover-up?  We already tried.  We tried.  What did he say?  We said you got to change tattoo artists.  Because then Troy Kwan came in here. 
[01:48:30]  Once again,  not a big tattoo guy,  but his shit looks really good.  Tattoos.  He's got good pieces.  And a nice body, yeah.  That looks like one of those  futuristic barcodes  that they put on you.  We said that too.  Did you?  Yeah, yeah.  I said I seen better work  carved into a tree.  Oh, shit.  That's so fucking funny.  I don't want to say it.  There's certain people going,  really?  Even this is better.  What?  It was against my will. 
[01:49:00]  I can't.  I don't want to.  I'll tell you off of air.  I'm so confused.  What is he doing?  Okay.  What's wrong with your hand?  I don't know what that was.  While he's writing,  Sean Cully,  she was talking about  the MIT police officer.  Oh, and you know what?  Now I owe all of Boston  an apology.  I should know that guy's name.  Yeah, that was a horrific  fucking thing.  I didn't know him by name.  I apologize.  That goes to your point  about the media  that we all know  the cop's name  and not the cop's name.  I so apologize now  because I threw  the glee thing in there 
[01:49:30]  because I didn't know him.  I said,  oh, that's the glee kid.  That was a horrible timing  on my part.  Everyone should know  that guy's name,  of course.  Yeah.  And he should have been  on the fucking cover  of Rolling Stone.  Right.  Oh, you're against us, too.  Everybody's against us.  You can't really be against it.  Why?  Freedom of the press,  freedom of speech.  I think Rolling Stone,  it's a dick move.  And, well,  we just did the whole thing.  But basically,  they're using the wrong picture, too.  They're making him look  like a fucking rock star.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Like a Jim Morrison  or like, you know, 
[01:50:00]  like he's the lead singer  of one of these  young, hip fucking bands  out there.  Yeah, okay,  but freedom of the press.  They do the story,  put it on the cover  if you have to,  but you could have picked  so many different other pictures  where people would have been  sort of okay with it.  Okay, I just heard this  on Imus,  so it's not me.  Ah.  Okay, so it's not me.  It was one of those  saying it's on the way  in instead of us.  What's that?  You son of a bitch.  I don't have it in my car.  I don't have you guys.  Oh, man.  Maybe if, uh...  We have to barter?  Yes.  Yeah.  You know,  there was a time  when these guys,  they came in  on a regular basis. 
[01:50:30]  Rich is obviously  one of them.  They would just give you  free fucking...  Advertisement.  No, free subscriptions.  Well, someone,  I think Bernie  or one of them  said on Imus,  you wouldn't put  George Zimmerman  on the cover  of Rolling Stone,  you know?  And the fucking  liberal guy,  what's his name?  Alan Combs is sticking.  I mean,  no matter what...  But you're right.  They would never put  Zimmerman on the cover  like that.  Because he's on a sex symbol.  No, but even...  Well, it still feels like  this kid in a weird way 
[01:51:00]  is a sex symbol.  They wouldn't put  Zimmerman on the cover  unless it was in context.  They'd put him  on the cover,  a picture of him  sitting in the chair  as a defendant.  They'd put him  in maybe the mug shot.  Just anything  but him just  standing there.  They wouldn't get  a picture from his wife.  Right.  Hey, where's a real  nice picture of George  standing against the wall  or something  and use that picture.  They wouldn't do it.  Right.  Even though he wasn't  convicted of any crime,  they still wouldn't do it. 
[01:51:30]  This guy wasn't  convicted either,  but come on.  Right.  But still,  it's just  because they know  that there's a lot  of little teeny bopper girls  that are  dying over this kid.  That's not the reason.  They put it on there  to get everybody  in radio and TV  to talk about it.  Yeah, I do.  And we're acknowledging that,  but the mainstream news,  they make believe  they're outraged too.  Like, look what  Rolling Stone did  as they show the cover.  Those fucking idiots  have been plastering  this guy for, 
[01:52:00]  you know,  day one.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, you know,  and bottom line  is all this happens  and all this bullshit,  but really still  nobody knows  who won the marathon,  you know.  What kind of microphone  is that?  No, it was a...  It's a square in a box.  No, it's not Porte's.  I'm saying...  That was in Porte's.  Was it in Porte's?  Yeah, you were hoping  for a laugh there.  No, no, not at all.  I'm just saying,  I'm trying to be...  It was some Kenyan,  I think.  Oh, okay.  Or an Ethiopian kid.  You know,  no, I'm totally... 
[01:52:30]  I totally...  What's the word?  I was...  Dumb.  I felt bummed  and horrible.  Yeah, you know,  bummed isn't really  the word bummed.  I said dumb.  I said dumb.  Oh, I said dumb.  And I'm totally,  I'm totally...  He goes, dumb.  You know,  my heart went out.  You know,  there's certain things  you hear on the news,  whether it be that  or up in Connecticut  or even just one kid.  You know,  a parent left  a baby in a car 
[01:53:00]  that fucking,  you know,  died.  So there's certain things  that hit you hard.  You know what I mean?  I don't know why.  That hit me fucking hard.  When Liam Nelson's wife died,  who,  what was her name?  Skian.  I got good stuff.  Liam Nelson's wife.  She was Skian.  Oh, Liam Nelson.  Yeah, sure.  From Taken.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's probably not his real name,  but it's close.  It is his real name.  I just forgot about him.  Liam Nelson's wife's name.  She died of some kind  of brain aneurysm.  She hit a tree.  Oh, hit a tree  and then it turned into a fucking... 
[01:53:30]  And I was so fucking upset  and I never met the lady.  Why?  Huh?  Why were you upset?  Because it was just a trap.  Someone shouldn't die like that.  What's your favorite  Liam Nelson movie?  It's been in a lot of them.  I like the first Taken.  I kind of liked The Wolves,  even though it was...  It's had no...  It's just wolves attacking people,  which kind of I liked.  You know what I'm talking about?  The Grey?  The Grey.  Oh, that movie stunk.  It did stink,  but I liked it.  The Wolves. 
[01:54:00]  It's like a child is in here.  But there's some weird intelligence  that's interwoven  in this nonsense.  The Wolves.  So, you know,  so your heart does go out.  Yeah, of course.  To Liam Nelson losing his wife.  Mrs. Nelson.  Mrs. Nelson, right.  And kids are crippled up in Boston  over some fucking bullshit.  Yeah, yeah.  Bullshit.  You know.  Yeah, that's...  That's why he shouldn't be on the cover.  I mean, really.  We have to take a break.  Wait, but one more thing.  You guys have three, 
[01:54:30]  eight TVs in here going  and not one on the British Open.  I know,  and every year we do that.  So, is Mars working today?  I do want the British Open.  I think I saw him.  I kind of got it up  on my computer, though, Voss.  Tiger Woods tees off  at 9.45 this morning,  I think is his tee time.  I want to...  Who are you gunning for?  Zach Johnson's leading.  Zach Johnson is minus five already.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him. 
[01:55:00]  I want somebody...  I want a schlub to win.  I want, you know,  like a Charlie Hoffman  or just some...  Charlie Hoffman!  No, I'm saying like a schlub,  just some douche  that hasn't won anything.  What about the kid  that won last week?  Great.  19 years old.  19 years old.  The youngest...  Arnold Palmer should tell him  keep kicking him in the nuts  and then he should get his hat.  And then he should hit himself  over the head with a golf club.  I wish you were here.  It was an hour.  We killed him.  Oh, it's just brutal.  And we try not to kill Joe,  but it...  I love Joe.  It was fun, though, man.  I love Joe. 
[01:55:30]  I love hanging out with Joe.  He's one of the most...  I love him, too.  Fun people to go out  and drink with.  I love when he does our show.  But that fucking tat  is an abomination.  And he's just making it worse.  Yes.  It was bad,  and now I think it's even worse.  Now it's worse.  I think so.  Why the block lettering?  Like, if you even wanted to do that,  why not get some fancy...  That's what...  Some type of lettering  that makes it look...  That's what Troy said.  Maybe make it into a banner.  Right.  There's so much you could do with it.  That was, like, stamped. 
[01:56:00]  Like, fucking no-frills corn.  I'll tell you,  the guy at Immortal Inc.  would never do that to him.  Ah, the guy...  Josh, you son of a bitch.  What?  He would never do that.  I saw what you did.  He is a plugging motherfucker.  He's going to run over  to that tattoo.  You hear?  I plugged you.  No, no one was just...  I plugged you.  I'm saying...  I plugged you.  How about my tramp stamp?  Oh, fuck.  Rich, I'm going to give you a compliment.  So, I'm on Twitter yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, shit.  You got a big fan out there,  and the guy was panicking.  He's like, you know,  Rich is playing Levity Live,  and I want it to, you know,  turn out well for him.  I want a big turnout for Rich Voss.  Just to...  I don't know the guy.  Yeah.  I'm like, don't worry.  Actually, he's coming in to promote.  No, I looked up all that.  The club owner.  I was suspicious.  It's my other account.  I was suspicious.  I was like, all right,  is it the club owner?  Does this guy work there?  But it seems like he's just a fan.  I go, don't worry.  He's coming in to promote.  So, you're Levity Live all weekend? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Which is a great club.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Have you been up?  I haven't been up there.  I've never been.  No, I was there  when it was the other club.  I know you like to eat well,  like myself,  but try the chocolate chip cookies.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  When did you go up there?  Who was working?  I've seen...  Robert Kelly up there.  I've seen Jim Brewer up there.  And someone else.  Oh, Robert Kelly.  That's why you ate the cookies.  Yeah, they were all over the fucking place.  Him and Dan Soder.  They were great.  I've never really watched Dan.  Dan Soder's fucking funny, man. 
[01:57:30]  Is he getting funny?  He's getting a lot of heat.  What do you mean, getting?  You never thought he was funny?  No, no, no.  But he's growing.  When I knew him,  he was a new comic, kind of.  He's going to be one of the guys  we're talking about in a few years.  Yeah.  No, he's getting a lot of heat.  He's fucking funny, man.  And Kelly killed, obviously.  I've never seen Bobby not do well  with that dog and pony show.  I've never seen...  Bobby kills.  Kills.  Not does well.  No, he kills every time I see him. 
[01:58:00]  He does like a brewer kill.  Bob, you know, there was a time...  Fuck it.  I don't give a fuck anymore.  No.  Sorry, Ant.  I'm kidding.  Did I...  No, no.  I'm just saying, oh, no.  What are you going to say?  It's not even that bad.  He opened up for Dane Cook  because I think it might mess up  Dane using him.  He was better than Dane Cook.  I saw him in a smaller venue  this one year.  It goes back a few years.  And the people I was with...  And Dane...  I'm not taking anything away  from Dane Cook.  I'm not one of those fucking haters.  I like Dane Cook and I like his comedy. 
[01:58:30]  But Bob Kelly that night  was definitely better than Dane Cook.  Listen, I don't want to...  I'll follow pretty much anybody  I don't want to go on after Bobby.  Yeah.  Really?  No, because...  Because of that energy.  ...they're not going to listen  to intelligent humor after that shit.  Bobby can absolutely make it look like  he's going off book.  It's effortless.  Like, he looks like  he's telling his shit,  he's doing his act,  and then he looks like  he's going off book  when he's talking about something else.  And he does a little bit of crowd work  in there to really make it look like 
[01:59:00]  he's...  It looks like he's ad-libbing  the fucking thing.  Well, I wonder who was doing that  20 fucking years ago.  Oh, my God, Rhett.  You motherfuckers.  Open the door!  No, he's one of my...  Look at how great you are  after the break.  Don't worry about it.  No, he is one of my favorite  people on the planet.  All the fucked up people.  He is a planet.  He's one of my favorite people  on himself.  Him, DeRosa, Colin.  And you can't get better  fucking people to know.  They're just...  DeRosa's really fucking funny, too. 
[01:59:30]  We went to Home Grown Ups 2,  the premiere.  Oh, you did?  And we were hanging out  with Colin after it.  Oh, that's right.  Colin said you were there, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's just a fun guy  that can take anything  thrown his way.  I was with you at.  Did you enjoy it?  Oh, we had...  It was a great time.  Yeah, we had a good time.  And we went there  and then we went to the party.  It was a lot of fun.  How bad is the movie?  Oh, I'm not a critic.  I don't know.  He's not a critic. 
[02:00:00]  Here's how I look at the movie.  Yeah?  It'll do well.  It did 40 million  the first weekend.  You know,  for the audience  it's targeting,  they're going to love it.  You know what I mean?  I was happy  we were able to get  David Spade in.  He was great on the show.  Huh?  I forgot to bring you up.  I wanted to so badly.  You tell...  A couple of other radio guys  have brought it up.  He goes,  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was held hostage.  Oh, he does talk about it.  Well,  a cowhead brought...  I talked about it on cowhead  and a cowhead...  So basically the story goes  that when David Spade 
[02:00:30]  was coming up  before we knew him  as David Spade...  He was a new comic.  He was a new comic  and you were...  From Arizona.  And he came into New York  to do some shows?  What happened...  I was hanging with  this guy, Frankie,  who was a heroin addict  and I was a crack addict.  Frankie...  Wow.  Frankie Dushy  was a major heroin addict  and I was a major crack addict.  No, he's dead.  And when he died,  he died the day  after his dad died.  So they didn't want  to have another funeral  so they cremated him  and just threw him  in his dad's coffin.  Wow.  Right?  True.  Yeah.  The sister said, 
[02:01:00]  we can't deal with this  and they put him  in the same coffin.  We can't deal with this enough.  Enough.  Fucking plant them both.  So Frankie's a major heroin addict  and I'm a crack addict.  And we're doing a one-nighter  and this kid from Arizona  comes up.  He's new.  You know,  a prop act  and I'm horrible.  He was a prop act?  Yeah, he started off  he was doing props.  Wow.  He was horrible.  I was horrible.  And Frankie was a good comic  and we were driving him  back to New York  and we go,  we got to make a couple stops.  Oh, no.  And we drove him  up to Spanish Harlem. 
[02:01:30]  A little white kid  from Arizona.  We drove him up  to Spanish Harlem.  I said, look,  I got to go see my sister.  She lives here.  Yeah, she's not doing well.  And, you know,  there's fucking guys  in the streets  with knives and shit  and I run up.  I get some crack  and he's like,  can you fucking take me back  to the, you know,  you drop him off  at the improv  and then Frankie,  I go, we got one more stop  and we went to the Lower East Side  for Frankie to get heroin.  So Frankie's getting heroin  and now we're driving around  as Frankie's in the back seat 
[02:02:00]  shooting up.  With David Spade?  He wasn't David Spade.  No, I know.  He was a fucking open mic-er.  Was he horrified?  Oh, man.  I wish I asked him about this.  He was from fucking Arizona.  Does he remember this?  Yeah, he said,  because when Cowhead brought it up,  he said,  yeah, those fucking guys  took me hostage  while they went to get drugs  or something.  But I mean...  Shot up in the car?  Frankie was shooting up.  It was hard.  He was in the back seat.  That's why he had  the luxury of shooting up.  I was driving  so I couldn't smoke 
[02:02:30]  at the time.  I mean,  don't get me wrong,  there was times  I drove and smoked  at the same time  and cooked as I was driving.  But in New York,  the roads are too bumpy  to do that.  Right, right, yeah.  You can't cook your shit up  on the bumpy roads  of New York.  I was on 167th Street  and we just copped  some cracks and coke  and I'm pulling up the street  and I see at the end  of the fucking block  there's cops there  pulling everybody over 
[02:03:00]  and I go,  pull over.  So we get up to him,  I go,  I'm fucked  and he goes,  pull over  and I went to pull  and I turned right  and took off  and he took his billy club  and smashed my taillights  as I fucking drove away.  He showed you.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I said,  I'm getting the fuck out  and I just took off.  Wow.  Did I ever tell you  the time I tried  to rip the dude off  and he punched me  in the face?  Did I ever tell you  that story?  Probably.  I think I did.  Tell me he's trying  to fucking rip off  Did you ever try heroin?  Just a couple times.  With the needle?  I didn't like it.  Oh, that's it. 
[02:03:30]  Twice.  Two or three times.  They're saying  heroin's making  a huge comeback.  It is?  That's what they were  saying yesterday  on one of the news shows.  It's been around  for a while though.  But they're saying  it's making a comeback.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  It doesn't seem  like it ever went away.  I think,  I mean,  you know,  the whole thing,  they're all fucked up  but,  you know,  you see meth  in the news,  meth,  because it's  in the white neighborhoods.  That's why meth  got so fucking famous.  You know,  this crystal meth  but it was 
[02:04:00]  in the fucking  white neighborhoods.  If that was  up in the projects,  you wouldn't hear  all these meth stories.  No.  It wouldn't be glorified  the way it is.  You know,  crack is really  up in the  black neighborhoods  so it's not,  it was never as glorified  as meth is.  Well,  it wasn't  New Jack City.  Well,  meth has been around  forever.  You know,  it was a biker drug,  crystal.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Crank was,  biker's were.  Remember that shit  from the 80s?  Yeah,  fucking crank.  You used to snort it  because you didn't have  enough money for coke  and it would burn 
[02:04:30]  your fucking nose.  It would burn,  yeah.  It was like glue.  Yeah.  It was like,  like rubber cement  kind of,  it didn't cut like coke.  You tried meth?  It was goopy.  I snorted a little crank  back in the day.  A little crank?  A little crank.  Is that what they cook now?  I have no idea  what they do these days.  I have no fucking idea.  All I know is  you'd stay up for a day  or two days  and you're fucking just  Oh,  yeah,  it was crazy.  Wired and horrible.  Yeah.  Sounds awful.  I never had a lot of it. 
[02:05:00]  I never bought it.  I never,  like,  had it.  My brother's friend  or something  would come over  and have someone  and be like,  oh,  what is that?  And the burn.  That's funny  when people that did drugs,  I never bought it.  I never bought fucking drugs.  I didn't lure her  into the car.  I never really,  I never bought drugs.  I usually,  You weren't a band.  You got them free.  Yeah,  that's usually what happened.  Or my house  was like a party. 
[02:05:30]  It made it seem different  if you didn't buy them.  Yeah.  Like you weren't addicted  or something.  Yeah.  It was always around  when I went to college.  If you had coke  and you couldn't get pushy.  We never really copped it.  It was always just like,  It was around.  Yeah.  It was just there.  I guess I'd be driving  into the fucking city.  I don't know.  I guess we technically  bought a movie  and throw a few bucks in.  I don't know.  We just,  I don't know,  whatever.  I don't want to get  into my drug stories.  You know.  Yeah,  man.  Levity live this weekend.  We got to take a break,  Rich Voss. 
[02:06:00]  So,  starting tonight  or it's Friday and Saturday?  Friday,  Saturday,  Saturday and Saturday.  I got to leave here  and go work on the set today.  It's a great club.  It really is.  They do a really good job up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to find out.  The food is really good.  They hired a pretty decent chef  to,  you know,  make the food good.  Well,  Chris,  I mean,  Chris who owns Gotham,  they own it.  Yeah,  I know.  They run,  he runs it tight.  He runs,  you know what I mean?  It's a whole nother level.  There's some pride there.  Yeah.  You know,  Vinny has that same type of feel  where he has pride in what he does. 
[02:06:30]  I know it's easy to make fun of the guy.  Vinny's my friend,  but I like,  I know it's easy to make fun of him,  but he runs it.  You know,  you could tell it's his baby.  Well,  yeah.  And what I like how he decorates.  I didn't like that he added his name  to the fucking sign.  Well,  that he hangs Vinny Brand's stress factory.  It used to just be the stress factory.  Well,  he took the phone down,  but he hung up all the shit from garage sales  like bicycles and bird cages.  He's like a fucking hoarder.  Okay.  Does it look like TGI Fridays? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  We went there last night to do open mic.  You know,  me and Bonnie,  that's our night out.  We take the kid,  we went to open mic.  Sounds like a horrible night out,  by the way.  Because that's what you guys do for a living.  Why wouldn't on your night out,  you go do something different?  We do.  We did Monday night.  We went to a director's premiere,  but on the other night,  because she wanted to do a set,  you know,  so we go out,  we practice new material,  and then we went out for pizza,  you know,  and then plus you go into the open mic night,  me and Bonnie,  we're like fucking major celebrities. 
[02:07:30]  Oh.  At an open mic night.  You know,  it opens up like the Red Sea when we walk in.  Oh, you know.  That's your parts, you know.  It's all relative.  It really is.  Travis,  you got that Eddie Vedder song for the break?  No,  I have to have Coke Logic send it.  Oh, man.  He sent it to Rob Sofortis.  Another thing.  Yeah.  No one would even know what those initials meant.  You can't get over it, right?  I can't get over it.  I know.  Like,  like he's walking around.  No one can look at that and go,  oh,  that means keep kicking them in the nuts. 
[02:08:00]  Like,  no one will know what that means.  But he knows.  It's his thing with George Carlin.  He knows that.  He doesn't care if others know.  Why didn't he just put the monkey claw from Pryor?  I mean,  that's a pretty fucking great bit.  And no one,  no one would look at that and go,  wow,  that's really nice work.  That should let you know right there that you got a really bad tat.  Yeah, 
[02:08:30]  it's really horrible.  This fucking work.  This dude looks great.  It's all right.  Yeah,  I know.  We've already looked at it three times.  I'm fucking very impressed.  It's a very nice tat.  It's terrific.  You do know we're not chicks,  right?  It's nice.  Okay.  That's all.  What else do you need from us?  I mean,  we're not chicks.  You do that with chicks.  You know what I'm saying?  He's going to his beautiful tattoo.  Yes.  Nice work.  I mean,  Sam,  Sam's,  like I said last time when I was here, 
[02:09:00]  Sam's isn't bad.  I mean,  you know,  it looks like a kid's book,  but it's not bad.  I like it.  Jack White.  A kid's book.  Like the writing and the books I read for,  you know,  we'll get to the next break and we'll move on.  I may well do.  All right.  Fair enough.  The O.P. and Anthony's show will return in a moment.  After all,  millions have been pissed too.  The O.P. and Anthony's show 
[02:09:30]  continues.  This is the new Van Halen song. 
[02:10:00]  And now that David Lee Ross is a friend of ours,  we didn't ask him about the new song,  did we?  No.  Mm-mm.  Make your thing.  There's a sister walking around here.  A sexy sister.  A sister walking around here with a sundress on.  Yeah.  And all her shit be just fucking jiggling and shit.  Mm-hmm.  How fucking hot are sundresses?  We said just before we got here.  They're the greatest things ever.  They're like baby doll slash sundresses. 
[02:10:30]  They're like you,  because you could fantasize that you could just lift them up.  Yeah.  You know.  Lift them up.  Or you could just like slide the straps off the shoulders  and they'll just fall to the floor.  What's the,  but it'll just.  I should date this hot shit cat.  She's so fucking hot.  Yeah.  How hot was she?  She wore sundresses.  And there's,  and you come off like from the pool or something,  and they're a little sweaty.  You got that sweat on you.  You could see through them for the most part. 
[02:11:00]  Slide up and down each other.  And the sun,  they walk toward,  toward the sun.  You kind of look through,  right through the sundress.  I'm sure Bonnie looks good in the sundress.  Yeah.  What's up?  Huh?  Huh?  She's looking in the sun.  Oh, God.  No, she does.  She's looking really pretty.  The last couple of days,  I go,  man,  you're looking very pretty.  Is she gussing herself up?  She looked pretty.  I thought so,  she looked so good that I fixed her clogged toilet.  This bitch.  Wow.  Got so much shit in her. 
[02:11:30]  She clogged two toilets at once.  I'm like,  stop.  Oh, God.  Wait,  your wife is clogging the toilets at home?  Yeah,  but she looks,  she's been looking really pretty.  Man.  You know,  and.  Yeah.  Have you,  what have you done about that?  Huh?  What is going on there?  What's in his shirt?  There's a little kid walking around.  There's a sword.  He's walking around with his sword.  He's,  he's the radio watch here.  Oh,  my,  what goes on around here?  Is that a tour? 
[02:12:00]  I don't know.  Yeah,  I guess so.  Yeah.  Yeah,  she's,  she's,  she got a book deal.  Nice.  Bonnie,  and she's doing good,  man.  She's fucking,  not Bonnie.  Do you treat her nicely?  I,  it's all relative.  What do you call night?  You know,  I fucking,  yeah.  I hear you.  You know,  I mean,  what the fuck?  I pay the bills.  I,  you know,  I fucking,  uh,  we play a lot of tennis now.  Do you and Lindsay play tennis?  What?  Do you guys play tennis? 
[02:12:30]  What?  Why?  Why?  I hate tennis.  Are you kidding me?  I've always hated tennis.  And there was a time.  Look at the baby,  man.  Look at him.  Oh.  Miloš.  Seifel?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Um,  that's my go-to.  Did you wet yourself?  I,  there was a time I tried all sports.  Miloš.  I hated tennis.  Always hated it.  Fucking great,  man.  You like tennis,  huh?  Yeah,  man. 
[02:13:00]  You fucking,  you like tennis and I bet he's not even married like I am.  No,  I,  I'm not a big tennis fan.  No,  I like paddle ball way more than tennis in the little,  in that,  you mean outside or outside,  inside.  I don't give a fuck.  Thank you,  Jackie.  I would just,  I would play with myself.  Thanks.  I would play with myself if I had to.  I would play with myself.  I didn't care.  I liked paddle ball.  Yeah?  Oh,  yeah. 
[02:13:30]  You like paddle ball?  And then I liked hand ball until it got a little,  until,  a little homoerotic with that ass is up shit.  You played ass is up?  What's ass is up?  Oh my God.  It's a long island thing,  I think.  Is it just long island?  I don't,  I don't think that,  we would play,  I'm not sure,  but it was big and long island.  We would play chinky hand ball,  you know,  where it had a bounce.  Chiny hand ball.  Yeah,  it had a bounce before it hit the wall.  Yeah.  What's ass is up?  When you lose,  you had to fucking go against the wall.  Assume the position on the wall like you were being frisked by a cop.  And then everyone got a shot at your ass. 
[02:14:00]  Yes!  And then they threw the ball as hard as they could at your ass,  and the worst thing that could possibly happen  was the ball would bounce,  hit the wall,  bounce back,  and hit you in the nuts.  We did that in Jersey too.  Did you?  Jersey had that too?  Oh,  you did asses up in Jersey?  Yep.  You know,  because they play handball in prison a lot.  Oh,  yeah.  I don't think they play asses up on the handball court.  No,  no,  that's the show I think.  And then back then,  you're wearing loosey-goosey shorts because it's summer,  so you're not protected.  It was just like,  what are we doing?  How about we just play another game? 
[02:14:30]  Why do we have to stop the festivities for the asses up part?  Play asses up?  Oh,  no.  Because we were already playing for money,  so,  you know,  the game's meant something.  Someone's winning.  Did you play asses up with softball in the losing team?  Oh,  with a softball.  With a bat.  Remember,  you would make your body as tiny as possible,  but the ass was still there.  Yeah.  For everyone's enjoyment.  Terrible,  terrible fucking game.  So stupid.  Oh,  Jesus,  they all call.  Wow. 
[02:15:00]  We're doing a benefit for Otto.  Yeah,  I know.  When is that?  Oh,  yeah.  The 28th.  How's he doing?  I don't know.  I haven't talked.  I heard he's doing better,  but we're doing a benefit in Jersey,  and the guy asked me to,  you know,  mention it.  Yeah,  like viral meningitis or something.  Jesus.  That's some fucking.  That shit be serious.  How do you get that?  I don't want to know.  I don't know.  I don't even want to know.  Don't even tell me.  Yeah,  I know.  You get anxiety thinking about it.  I don't even want to know.  If it happens,  it happens.  I just don't want to know,  you know, 
[02:15:30]  how it happens.  I don't know.  Terrible.  When's the benefit?  July 28th in Parsippany,  I think,  or in that area.  Go to the website.  The guy's counting on you.  This is the only reason we're talking about it.  He just texted you.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know where the fuck it is.  Text me where it is.  It's in Parsippany.  I'll find out where it is on the 28th that morning.  Could you tattoo it to your arm or something for everybody?  What am I,  Momento?  Momento.  Momento?  It's Momento.  It's Momento. 
[02:16:00]  The gay one.  Yes.  That's a breath mint for homosexuals.  Oh,  I want to get gross on the phone so bad.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  That is fucking,  I'm,  I'm beside myself with that tat.  It keeps going to voicemail.  It's so bad.  The microphone,  just because it's got crisscrossy lines  that is supposed to resemble a mic screen,  like it doesn't look anything like a microphone.  It looks like a cigarette.  That tattoo is what you get 
[02:16:30]  when you get your first tattoo  and someone does it with a,  like a needle and Indian ink.  Right.  Even the lettering is horrible.  Indian ink, by the way.  Indian ink.  Yeah, the K's don't match.  They're horrible.  A bacterial meningitis he had.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  I guess that's different.  Yeah, we got to raise some money for auto.  Yeah, it'll be good.  All right.  We'll do that.  Levy, Vos, Bonnie,  and whoever else we get.  Yeah, we tweeted a couple times  when I think Levy or somebody else tweeted it,  but I,  it fucking amazes me that he, 
[02:17:00]  by the way,  can we just,  destroyed his arm.  Can we just let the people know  we're fully aware of the,  the picture of the locker  with the wow stickers and the noose.  We have chosen to not talk about it.  Mm-mm.  It's whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I need more honey.  Why?  It's not sweet enough.  All right.  My tea for my throat.  But everyone's like,  I can't believe you're,  you know,  uh,  you know,  uh,  what the hell happened? 
[02:17:30]  Thank you,  Jackie.  Oh, Jackie,  thank you so much.  What?  SUNY Brockport?  SUNY Brockport.  Um,  I'm going to be a junior.  Oh.  How fast she came in.  It was terrific.  It was fucking great.  What,  what's your,  uh,  college does your boyfriend go to?  He doesn't go to school.  Why not?  He's a landscaper.  Oh.  You believe that?  Hi.  Fucking landscaper's getting that.  Huh?  Crazy.  It's crazy.  He's probably out in the sun.  He's all cut. 
[02:18:00]  Looks all tan and everything.  Yeah.  You know.  Except for his thighs.  He's got the really white thighs  and then from there down is all.  You'll see it in the fucking winter  when he's begging you for money  to go by dinner  because he doesn't have  a fucking lawn to cut.  All right?  And he's too lazy to shovel snow.  Oh, man.  He plows.  He plows?  Yeah.  Plows, snow.  Oh, snow.  In Rochester.  No, don't make that.  Snow.  We got confused.  In Rochester,  it snows a lot,  so it works.  Oh, that's where you're from,  Rochester?  Boy,  it doesn't snow a lot up there.  It's gross.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:18:30]  And you're just down here  interning?  Yep.  Did he come down with you?  No.  So you're down here alone?  Yes.  Have you ever been on a movie set?  No, I haven't.  Neither is Rich.  You ever been in a BMW?  No.  You've never been in a 528XR,  my new one?  It's not new.  What year is it?  It's new to you.  2010.  That's new to you.  Yeah, you don't buy a new car.  I know,  but you can't say it's new.  It's new to you. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  New-ish.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure it's in good shape,  but...  How tall is your boyfriend?  He's 5'6", 5'7".  Is he built?  Is he like fucking...  I mean,  is he a tough dude?  Yeah,  he's Italian.  Sicilian.  Oh, all right.  You better leave him.  No.  I like Roger.  How long have you been together?  Two years.  Two years.  Two years.  What about before that?  Who'd you have there?  My longest relationship before that  was like three months.  I was never really...  Oh, wow, really?  Yeah,  I was never really a commitment person.  I love how she's talking 
[02:19:30]  like she's 45 years old.  I know, right?  I'm comfortable with that.  You're too young  to have long relationships.  Yeah, I didn't.  I never had one.  I always got bored too quick.  Oh.  Is that an engagement ring?  It's a promise ring, yeah.  A promise what?  What?  That'll buy a new plow?  I promise I'll buy a new pickup this year.  What's the promise ring?  Is that a pre-engagement ring type thing?  Is that what happens?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think that's, yeah.  Oh, that's adorable. 
[02:20:00]  It looks like it was an heirloom  from a family member.  No, I think he bought it.  But he did pretty nice.  He didn't ask for any help or anything.  He picked it out himself.  Isn't engagement a promise?  Yeah.  That's a pre-promise.  They're just adding an extra step.  That's a guy that doesn't totally want to commit.  But he wants to, like, literally,  like, get off my back,  but this is meaningless  and don't ask me about it anymore.  Did he give that to you  just before you moved to New York City by yourself?  Here's a promise.  You know what?  Here's a promise pocketbook. 
[02:20:30]  I promise that the next thing I get you  might be a ring.  Jackie's moving to dreary old Manhattan.  When did he get the promise rate?  Like a year ago.  Oh, okay.  He wanted to make sure  that ring was on your finger  before you moved to New York City.  Yeah.  That's when I got it.  Why were you in Philly?  You were interning there?  She tried school.  Yeah, I tried to go to Temple University  for a semester,  and it was way too scary.  Why?  Why was it scary down there? 
[02:21:00]  I saw someone shoot themselves  in the face.  Oh, yeah.  You talked about that.  Yeah, and it was just  right next to the North Philly,  so I was right in the ghetto,  and I was just scared all the time  to be myself  that I was going to be taken.  Well, you shouldn't racially profile like that.  Yes, you should.  It's fine.  You just walk around.  No, no, no.  I didn't racially profile.  I just said North Philly was scary.  But wait,  they shot themselves in the face?  Yeah,  like an alum came back on campus  and just...  Why?  I don't know why  I didn't talk to them before.  Damn. 
[02:21:30]  I just watched it.  It was not fun.  Oh, man.  He died doing what he loved.  Shoot himself in the face.  A lot of blood?  A lot of blood?  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  How far were you?  How far away?  Yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  I mean,  it was pretty far in the distance.  Yeah, still though.  Yeah, I mean, still.  It was scary to see.  Did you see him drop?  Yeah,  and he kind of just dropped  right on his back.  Oh, that's fucking horrible.  Was he a college kid  or just an alumni?  No, I think he was supposed to... 
[02:22:00]  He was an alumni.  He came back.  Yeah, he came back  to the alumni school.  Just to give everyone nightmares  for the rest of their lives.  Right.  Exactly.  What a great guy.  Thanks.  I get you're fucking in pain,  but how about you do that  behind closed doors somewhere?  Holy Jesus.  Well, they thought  it was a student at first.  How about you don't include us?  Huh?  They thought it was a student  at first,  so we weren't allowed to leave.  Like, we weren't allowed  to walk around or anything  because they didn't know  what happened.  Since you've been in New York,  how long have you been away  from your boyfriend?  About two months now? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, two months.  How many guys  have you made out with?  No.  Tell the truth.  None.  Not sex,  just made out.  None.  Made out.  Come on.  How many make-out sessions?  How many neck would?  None.  None?  None.  I'm a faithful person.  Any heavy petting?  Who's that?  Huh?  Heavy petting?  No, but I...  Isn't petting heavy petting,  by the way?  I don't know.  What makes it heavy petting?  That sounded so stupid.  You're right.  Heavy petting.  That's something from our  fucking day and age.  What was the difference  between petting 
[02:23:00]  and heavy petting?  Fucking finger.  A finger's in.  A finger?  A finger is in  for heavy petting.  Yeah, finner.  Heavy petting,  you left marks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Heavy petting  or discipline.  I don't know.  I just...  I never thought  that word was good.  Petting.  Don't get into  petting.  Petting.  Do they mean that  like petting?  Like you do a dog  only with a person? 
[02:23:30]  Cuddling.  It's just so horrible.  You forget.  Back in the day.  Back in the day,  it was like petting an animal.  You might be right.  If you think about it.  You're like,  shooka, shooka, shooka.  It wasn't one of those  scratching and petting it.  We didn't have hairless cats  when we were growing up.  That's true.  You got a point.  That's a new invention.  You got yourself a point.  So the whole petting thing  made sense.  Oh, she's just like  my daughter,  my middle daughter.  Looks like her  and just...  That's just...  Some guy.  So it's turning you on, then.  Ew!  I didn't...  I said my... 
[02:24:00]  I said my middle daughter,  not my five-year-old.  God, we should do  some vaudeville together, Rich.  We're good.  Start the car.  We're fucking good.  Pumping up my shit like that.  Back in the day,  like I've never been  a touchy person.  I met this girl  after my divorce.  Fucking as beautiful  as you possibly can be.  I met her in South Carolina.  We started dating.  She came to Alabama  to see me work.  We had sex.  She was beautiful.  She was in radio 
[02:24:30]  and she was really...  How'd you run it?  Then she came to Florida  and you know  when you just lose something?  I was laying in bed  and I was in Florida.  I had a fever  and I was really sick  and we're laying there  and she put her hands  like she's, you know,  petting and rummaging.  She goes,  what can I do for you?  I go,  first of all,  get your hands off me.  Oh.  Rich hates to be touched  even by beautiful women.  And then I just kind of like,  I got mean or,  I don't know,  but I always look back 
[02:25:00]  and go,  she was the nicest,  sweetest,  most beautiful girl.  All she wanted to do  was take care of you  and make you feel better.  And you were an asshole, Rich.  Yeah, maybe because I was sick.  Maybe.  I don't know,  but I apologize.  You don't like being touched?  What's wrong with you?  You don't like being touched  by a girl?  Depends.  What do you mean by touch?  I mean, you know,  yeah.  When I'm sick,  I want to be left alone.  Yeah, you just want to be,  I apologize to Sue Larson  if I was rude to you  20 years ago.  Don't give her name out.  Why?  She's in radio. 
[02:25:30]  Where did she work?  I don't know now.  I would love to hear  her side of the story.  No, I apologize to her.  She was the sweetest,  nicest girl.  Beautiful,  just,  just,  sounds lovely.  That's the kind of girl  I would have married.  Instead of the one you have,  I guess.  You really are.  Bonnie should shoot you  in the face.  You're just a treasure.  No, I mean,  that's what I mean.  What a treasure.  What a wonderful.  Bonnie's the kind of girl  I'm married.  That's the kind of girl.  There's certain girls  that you're attracted to. 
[02:26:00]  Bonnie rules.  And he likes them  with pigtails.  All right, Jackie.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jackie.  What a great girl.  Oh, there's the honey for you.  Oh, that's right.  It was all about the honey.  All about the honey.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  She rules.  She's,  my daughter,  my daughter interns.  Interning is the biggest  fucking scam in the business. 
[02:26:30]  No kidding.  My daughter interns around,  you know,  for like a suit company,  a big distributor.  And I'm going,  it's fucking like slavery.  They do all the work  for free.  It's just what a scam.  My daughter said,  she's 20.  She interns.  She goes,  you know what?  I'm going to hire  an intern for me.  She's trying to get someone  to intern her intern.  For her internship.  Yes.  She's trying to find  someone to do it for her.  Like an intern for Creamerica.  Sure.  It's just,  I feel.  Of course. 
[02:27:00]  Rich.  What?  So you got a daughter,  but,  but it's like,  it's not like interning  is nothing.  Don't you get  to put it on  an application  for a job,  your resume?  You get credits  and you get all on it,  man.  I got to jump in.  Yeah.  You want to go  down the list  of interns  we've had over the years  and how many  are actually in the business?  Oh, boy.  It can't be a shit.  Sam Roberts  might be the only one.  You can't be a shit intern  and then be like,  well,  I technically interned,  so why don't I have a job? 
[02:27:30]  Sam,  do you know any other intern  we've had in the last eight years  that is actually in the business?  Just Sal.  Oh.  And that really says that.  That's a big drop off  right there.  I hear from guys  here and there  that are sort of  doing okay  after their internship here,  but they're not doing radio shows.  I mean,  I guess I could use  the credits  for another occupation,  right?  I mean,  they're school credits.  I would think  if you have a resume  and you're going around  and says,  I did an internship  at this,  here were my duties, 
[02:28:00]  things like that,  it's got,  you know,  can't hurt.  You can use the time  to meet people.  Networking,  sure,  you're meeting people.  And then the owner  that you're applying for  says,  this all looks great,  but my nephew  who's an alcoholic,  I think he'd do it  a lot better.  He's got the gig.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You know,  we'll keep your application  on file.  The position  no longer exists,  we just have the interns  do it for free.  Yeah,  yeah.  We don't need to hire anybody.  Coincidentally,  I see you're an intern here. 
[02:28:30]  You know,  an even bigger scam,  and I had to do this  when I was in Rochester,  I think there's a lot of people  that are going to be able  to relate to this one,  was temp to hire.  Oh,  yeah.  I was a temp to hire  for Xerox.  I was hired  by Xerox,  technically.  It wasn't a temporary position.  It was a full-time  fucking job,  and they would just  kind of like dangle  the hire part  over your fucking head,  and the reason was  they didn't have to pay  for health insurance  and all these other benefits. 
[02:29:00]  It was called temp to hire,  but it was bullshit.  It wasn't like  they hired and said,  we need you for a week or two.  It's like,  no,  here's a job,  and I would go,  when does it end?  Oh,  it doesn't end.  And I'm like,  well,  then why is it  a temp to hire job?  Yeah,  yeah.  They could pay you less  and give you no health insurance.  Companies get away with murder.  I'm not sure if  they're getting away  with that one  as much as they used to  20-some-odd years ago.  That's bullshit.  They probably passed the law.  You would think, right?  At Xerox workforce  up in Rochester, 
[02:29:30]  there was a shitload  of temp to hire.  I mean,  a lot.  It wasn't just a little bit.  Go ahead.  Did the real employees  look down on the temp to hires?  Oh, no.  We're all just losers.  We were in shipping and receiving.  I'm not making it sound  like I had some amazing  fucking job  that really mattered.  But still,  the shipping and receiving  people need health insurance too.  Obviously.  They probably need it  more than,  what did we do?  Packing peanuts?  We played ping pong.  Oh. 
[02:30:00]  So maybe I shouldn't,  bitch.  Shipping,  receiving,  and ping pong.  And then we learned quickly  how to drive the forklifts,  which was a lot of fun  because we fucked around with that.  Oh, yeah.  I officially wasn't supposed  to be driving the forklifts.  No, forklifts are made  to have fun on job sites.  We got in,  extremely hungover  because it was the days  when the opster was partying  with the rest of them.  So you'd come to work,  everyone knows this shit,  you're fucking two,  three hours of sleep,  still drunk,  you sit there,  and we'd play ping pong 
[02:30:30]  and just shoot the shit  and shit talk,  everyone,  waiting for a fucking truck  to come in.  Then the truck would come in  and we'd have to do the...  Did you ever play  in Hong Kong?  There's a story I heard.  And then we get the manifesto  for the truck,  go through all that,  and then back to ping pong.  That's what happened.  I was working in a warehouse  and they said,  you are not allowed  on the forklift.  You are not allowed.  Oh, wow.  And I went out for lunch  and got high  and came back 
[02:31:00]  and decided to take  the forklift for a run  and I just crashed  and took all these  fucking rows of...  I mean,  it was a major accident.  Yeah.  And on the spot,  I got fired.  Wow.  On the spot.  But I got fired  from everywhere.  Yeah.  The temp to hire people  are calling.  Oh, my God.  That makes the phones ring.  Chris in Tampa,  what's up?  Hey, y'all.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Mac.  I work for a company  that handles  temp to hire positions, 
[02:31:30]  staffing company.  And it works for companies  because they get to  try you out  before they want to  invest all their money  in giving you,  like you said,  benefits,  vacation,  all that time.  And they can pay you less.  Now it'll all change  with Obamacare.  I understand,  but that's the theory.  But the fact is,  why would they ever  hire you,  hire you?  Because that would mean  more resources  from the company  going away.  They would have to now  pay your health insurance  and everything else  and give you a better  salary, too. 
[02:32:00]  Well, a smart company  will eventually hire you  if you're doing a good job  because then now  they risk losing you  to a company  that's going to give you  a good job.  They end up hiring  an extremely small  percentage of the  temp to hires.  That's the point.  All right.  Fair enough, though,  for work.  Someone's saying that  Josh in Massachusetts,  go ahead.  Hey, in Massachusetts,  they have a law  that you can't be  tempted to hire  more than six months.  Well, there's a company  out in Massachusetts,  that's well-known  that will bring you  in for six months,  let you go for a week, 
[02:32:30]  and then rehire you  for another six months  so they don't have  to pay the base.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's always a work around.  Sounds like how  De Niro was getting  the casino license.  It's like, oh, yeah,  when it reaches  the top of the pile,  we give you another title,  throw it at the bottom,  and he's applying  for the casino license.  Oh, right, right.  And Toyota still uses it?  It's high.  Kevin in Mississippi.  Hey, man, yeah,  Toyota does this as well. 
[02:33:00]  They hire and give you,  they'll tell you,  it may take you  up to three years,  and say they bring in  a group of, like,  four temps,  and there's one high girl  in it,  everybody's just  completely fucked  because she's automatically  going to get it,  and you just know it.  And these people  are working right beside you  doing the same shit you are  for, like,  a third of what  you're doing it for.  If you have a job  for three years,  that's not a temporary job.  No.  That's a job.  Holy fuck.  Amazing. 
[02:33:30]  Just amazing.  To me,  if you have a job  for three years,  that's retirement.  Did you work  in a factory once, Rich?  Yeah, I've worked  in everywhere.  Hold on.  We might have  an old friend  of yours on the line.  Mike?  You know Rich Voss?  Yeah, I know Voss.  Where did we,  are you from Plainfield?  Yeah, Rich, it's Mike.  Mike, uh...  Yeah.  He doesn't know  who you are.  I can't play this.  Yes, I do.  Who is it, Rich?  Mike V is his last name, right?  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  Okay.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on? 
[02:34:00]  We're talking Dugan.  What?  Oh, the place  that had the Zodiac signs  that we all stole?  Yeah, that you were  selling in school.  Yeah.  What?  They had these  round Zodiac.  There were these  round Zodiac things  that if you spun them around,  it landed on a birthday,  a Zodiac.  It was just a wheel  with Zodiac,  and I would steal them,  and I would...  And then go for the place  and take them to school  and sell them  all day long.  Yeah.  In high school.  In high school. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean,  you know,  I had to make money,  you know,  back then.  Is that where I got fired  with the forklift?  Was it Dugan's there?  I think it was.  He just fired you  because you were  stealing everything  you needed.  Ah, see.  A little thief.  I think I owe Mike  80 bucks from back in the day.  Watch it, Rich.  No, you lent me  for lunch money.  We'll talk later.  Hey, good hearing you. 
[02:35:00]  Take care.  All right, Mike.  Mike V, everyone.  Well, that was part of the thing.  You had to steal from the job.  It's really hard to do nowadays.  This guy was great.  I knew his family.  I knew him since like fourth grade.  I used to go to his house for lunch.  His mother was the nicest.  The whole family.  You actually knew someone  and had a good friend  in fourth grade?  He was a nice,  yeah, it was like fourth grade.  It's very unusual  to hear a story like that.  Why?  Then we went  and bought some coke.  No, no.  He didn't do drugs.  He didn't do drugs. 
[02:35:30]  He was the one guy  that didn't do drugs.  Who did in fourth grade?  Like in fourth grade,  Rich Jesus.  In high school,  I knew all the way  from fourth grade  to high school.  We didn't get a,  we didn't get into  the high school years.  We were talking about  fourth grade.  But he was like  the smartest dude.  He bought like  Coca-Cola routes  or whatever,  you know,  roots.  And, you know,  very successful.  But he was the one guy  I hung out with  that didn't do drugs.  Nice.  I don't know  why I hung out with him.  You're right.  In fourth grade.  In fourth grade.  No, in high school,  anywhere. 
[02:36:00]  I know, Rich.  Fucking just shooting up  before kickball.  Crazy.  Who doesn't steal?  That's a crazy town  you were brought up in.  Who doesn't steal from,  you know.  I said that.  From the job.  Yeah, I mean,  especially.  Little filferings,  all right.  It's a little Zodiac.  And I was selling them  to a teacher.  He was buying boxes  and reselling them.  Why did they have boxes  of these things?  They were,  like this,  boxes.  And all these Zodiac wheels  came in.  I know what they are.  But why would they  have so many?  It was a big,  I don't know.  Why would they have  so many bumper stickers 
[02:36:30]  coexist?  Because people buy them.  I was the candy kid.  Did you have the candy kids?  Oh, that's.  That came in with just candy  and then I would just  hike the price,  make it twice as much  and people would always  fucking buy their M&Ms  in there.  You mean you would buy  them at the store?  I was the candy kid.  Yeah, I would buy  sort of in bulk  if I could find it.  Oh, you did this too, Sam?  Yeah, I used to go to Costco.  Because for some reason,  my junior high,  I guess they didn't have  a vending machine.  So I had candy.  And people knew  I had candy. 
[02:37:00]  I'm like, yeah,  and I would fucking  double the price.  I was making good money  for a kid.  It would blow people's minds  because the gum said  25 cents right on the pack,  but obviously you buy  in bulk,  it's less than 25 cents.  So I would sell them  25 cents,  five for a dollar.  Oh no,  I would still hike it  from there.  And they'd go,  Sam, you're not making  any money.  I'd be like, I know,  just pick up five packs then.  I'm not making a cent.  So you were a candy kid too.  Oh yeah, big time.  But then I moved on  to being a bookie  in high school.  For real?  Yeah, for the assistant  basketball coach,  I was on the team. 
[02:37:30]  Crazy shit.  You know,  the fucking football,  you know,  the football sheets,  Rich,  that we all have done?  The assistant coach  was the main guy.  No way.  And then he kind of  got me almost like  He was the sheets guy?  He was the sheets guy.  In high school?  In high school.  It got ugly, man.  I think I was,  I'm trying,  I don't even know  how I got out of it,  but I was in a little  too deep because  somehow he knew  I was into it  because I think  I was getting  a sheet from him.  And then he's like, 
[02:38:00]  he was a little scared  so he needed a middle man.  No shit.  I was his middle man  and there was a,  there was a,  there was a side  of Harborfield's high school  at the time  where the slow kids  and all that went,  but that wing  also had a lot  of empty shit  that they didn't use anymore.  So we would meet  in an old fucking locker room.  No fucking funny business,  but you can make  your fucking jokes.  And we would do  the whole exchange and shit.  I would fucking give him  the money,  he would give me  the sheets  and all that shit.  And then I,  and then he,  then he would give me  the envelopes  to pay off everybody.  And I had to pay off  one of my fucking teachers 
[02:38:30]  after class  and the teacher knew.  So the whole class,  I'm sitting there  and he can't wait.  I think he hit,  it's been a long time,  but he hit eight for eight  or nine for nine.  He hit.  It was a couple,  it was a few thousand,  which was rare,  but he hit  and he knew he hit  and he knew the kid  that had the money  was in his fucking class  in the back room.  So then I had to kind of wait,  be the last kid out  and then fucking slide  in his envelope.  Holy fuck.  And then the guy,  I think I was a senior  and that's how it ended  because I remember he was, 
[02:39:00]  I was making,  I was making probably  a couple hundred bucks a week,  which was a lot of money  for a high school kid,  cash,  just to fucking hand him out  and get him from my friends  and stuff.  But it started expanding  way too much  where the teachers  were getting involved  and stuff.  And then he,  he was a shady dude  to begin with.  And then he knew  I was going to Geneseo.  State School  and a SUNY school  and he wanted me  to continue it up there  and that's when I was like,  all right,  this is fucked up.  I knew even in my stupid  young brain that,  all right, 
[02:39:30]  this is fucked up.  I got to get the fuck out of this.  Got to lay off of this shit.  But I remember how fucking,  I'm amazed.  And we would meet  in this like part  of the fucking school  that no one was using  and I was fucking scared shitless.  But what happened  if someone didn't pay?  I couldn't get out.  What happened  if someone didn't pay?  A teacher's not going  to take them out.  I'm going to break his legs.  I'm not sitting here  like I was a mafia guy.  Everyone was going to pay.  It was obvious.  It was so obvious.  Imagine that's in the news.  A teacher's breaking  students' legs  for not paying 
[02:40:00]  on sports betting.  Right.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, the payouts  were usually stupid money,  dumb money.  But this one time,  the teacher,  and I don't remember  what class he taught anymore,  but he fucking hit  and I had to fucking pay him.  Yeah, but you don't know  the kids,  you knew what they were betting  from their slips.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was a couple bucks here.  Five, three bucks.  Maybe you're getting  five bucks  from your fellow student,  maybe.  Maybe ten every once in a while.  You're not the only guy  doing this for that teacher.  There was probably  ten other kids.  In the school, you think?  In the school? 
[02:40:30]  Nah, I doubt in the school.  I went to kind of  a smaller high school.  Harbourfield was  kind of small at the time.  Maybe other schools.  Oh, he might have been,  yeah, yeah, sure.  Oh, sure,  I'm sure he had  his sheets elsewhere.  I mean, to risk  going to jail,  you're not going to do it  for $20, $30.  Yeah, that's true.  Probably want to make  some righteous bucks.  And I wake up one day  and I'm like,  what the fuck?  How did this happen?  I'm part of a gambling ring.  What happened?  What the fuck?  I was betting one week.  I bet on basketball, 
[02:41:00]  college basketball,  one week.  Isn't that like  a terrible bet?  I lost, no.  Betting on basketball  in any way, shape, or form.  The point spread  is really tough  to figure out.  I lost 12 out of 14 games.  That's almost impossible.  Right, that's harder to do.  You can flip a coin  and do better.  Yes.  I figured out  that point spread.  I think the best bet  is college.  You can take Indiana  but you've got to give  37 points.  No, college football  is the best to win  because those teams kill.  Hey, just don't forget  about the 14-point spread.  Right, exactly. 
[02:41:30]  What?  But they figured out  with college basketball,  that was a tough one.  Yeah.  I used to doubt a little bit.  College football was good  to bet on.  I think so.  Yeah, because they would  want to raise,  they would want to  pump up the score  for standings.  And the over-under.  God, I used to.  We've got to stop  talking about this.  This is your addiction.  I've got to shut up.  I don't want to be  the one that gives  Rich the itch.  Rich is just  this guy sold  McDonald's at school.  What?  He would just go 
[02:42:00]  and get, what,  bulk burgers?  A whole bunch of them?  That's a go-getter.  Let's take this.  Sure.  He's a go-getter.  Let's say hi to Al  in Maryland.  Yeah.  Al.  Al.  Hey, guys, Rich.  Hey.  I got my driver's license  in the mid-70s  when there was  not even gas rationing.  I worked at McDonald's.  They let us take  leftover food home  and the pie  transported pretty well.  I started giving them away  and then people  were standing in line.  So I started cooking  a few extra pies  every night  and made a tidy living  to keep my gas tank full 
[02:42:30]  back in those days.  I was the pie guy  at lunchtime.  Pretty popular.  Schicks loved it.  He just said,  Schicks loved it.  Schicks loved it,  so it's worth it.  So it's cool, man.  Yeah, I've told  the story before  about having the  Apollo air conditioning van  and no money  and I had the credit card  for the gasoline  for the van  and there was  a Texaco station  where the guy  had a lobster boat  also and would sell  the lobsters  out of the gas station.  So I'd pull up  half a tank of gas,  the rest lobsters, 
[02:43:00]  pay for it  on the company credit card,  go home,  boil them up.  I'm broke.  We're eating lobster tonight.  That's right.  I used to sell meat  and seafood out of trucks.  There was a company  where we used to drive around  selling meat.  Who would buy that?  It was the best stuff.  It was gourmet food  and gourmet shit  just dip out of each box.  Yeah.  One or two crab legs.  You got to take your taste.  A little skim.  You know,  a little for the effort.  A little taste.  They were big back in the day.  A little taste,  literally.  I understand a little taste. 
[02:43:30]  Sure.  Don't you remember  the little Toyota trucks  picking,  pulling up  and trying to sell you  meat and seafood?  Didn't they have  that on Long Island?  I don't remember those.  A fond memory.  I was at Washington Drive School,  so grammar school,  you know,  kindergarten through six.  And I figured out that,  these are all stories  we've told,  I guess,  but fuck it.  The lunch room,  they would make those  fucking peanut butter,  my thing was peanut butter  cookies back then, 
[02:44:00]  and they would put them  outside to cool.  So I figured out  if you go around  the entire school,  there's the trays  of cookies.  Oh, wow.  And I got away  with it for a long time.  I would just take  a couple every other  fucking day.  Sag them.  Yeah.  But I remember it being  where it wasn't as easy  as just going in,  you had to kind of like,  you know,  make some moves  to get into that area.  But I always did  and kind of reached around  and grabbed them.  It was so easy  to steal cookies,  you would just hold them  under the tray  as you're bringing  your tray through. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, good move.  Cookies under your tray,  I used to steal them  all the time.  I grew up,  I didn't get hot lunch.  Oh, we only got  hot lunch  because we had  a meal ticket.  Well, we got to  a free lunch thing.  Did any kid ever  pay for fucking lunch?  Hot lunch?  It seemed like  everyone had  that fucking welfare thing.  My mom's lunches  started getting  really shitty,  the ones we had  to bring to school.  So I finally  would just throw it  every day  and then get  a nice hot lunch  every day  on the little change  I was making  from being the candy  boy. 
[02:45:00]  The candy guy.  I treated myself  to a hot lunch.  A nice piece  of square pizza.  In California  behind Vons Supermarket,  it was where they  used to keep  the depositable bottles  and people would  bring it in  and they'd put it  but it was a big  locked cage  and we figured out  how to squeeze  in between  the chain link fence  and the pole  or climb over the top  one day  and then I'd just  offload them  to my brother  and we'd go 
[02:45:30]  right back around  and bring them in  and get money.  But you couldn't  take too much  because then  they would be  on to you.  You had to know  what kind of taste  to take.  It was just enough  for a box  of ice cream sandwiches.  Yeah, you had to  just take a little  taste so no one knows.  Love my ice cream sandwiches.  Just skim off the top  just a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't get greedy.  A little bit.  Don't get greedy.  A little bit.  You gotta do  what you gotta do,  you know?  Right.  We sent my,  when we were in like,  I don't know,  seven,  now we were in like  fifth grade 
[02:46:00]  and my brother  and his friend  were like in third grade  and we sent him  into the drugstore.  We said,  there's two of them.  We said,  whichever one of you two  steal the most for us.  Jesus.  Making a little gang?  Yeah.  We said,  you know,  we'll let you keep  what you get.  Uh-huh.  And so my brother,  little,  and this other guy,  you know,  he had two legs in  and he,  uh,  they went in stealing  and they got caught.  Oh.  They rat you out?  We were gone.  I left him there. 
[02:46:30]  Oh,  man.  Little thief.  I don't want anything  to do with a thief.  Probably ratted you though.  They made us.  Eeeh.  Eeeh.  The crying.  Eeeh.  I don't know  if there's a person alive  around our age  that hadn't,  hadn't had to sit  in a back room  of a supermarket  or some store  after getting caught.  But a lot of times  they didn't,  they didn't really,  they didn't really  involve the police.  Nah,  they didn't want to do that.  They just wanted  to scare the fuck out of you.  Yeah,  yeah,  they wanted to fuck 
[02:47:00]  with you a little bit.  I think mine was,  what was it,  Wallbaums in Greenlawn?  That supermarket?  Yeah,  yeah.  I think it was Wallbaums.  We got,  we got caught stealing  some shit.  Over there by Harmon Pizza.  And then we were  in the back room,  this asshole  that was probably  only a few years  older than us  scolding us.  Yeah.  Scaring the shit  out of us.  It worked though.  I was,  I was done.  Like,  your life of crime  was over?  Fuck that.  Yeah.  I don't need  some asshole  yelling at me.  So I'm trying  to grab a,  I don't even remember  back then.  Yeah,  Harmon Drugs  and Harmon Pizza 
[02:47:30]  were in the,  Sun Up Pizza  and Harmon Drugs  were by the  Wallbaums shopping  center there  in Greenlawn.  Okay.  Yeah,  that was where  the pizza place  we always used  to go to.  Me and Ant  lived in the same  neighborhood,  didn't know each other.  Yeah.  So weird.  It was like,  yeah,  and then meet  one town,  two towns away.  Same experience.  It's so weird.  And then we meet  years later.  We broke into a house  and while we were at sea.  That's my line.  This is what I like  about me and you. 
[02:48:00]  Our stories are  pretty innocent.  Long Island shit.  And a lot of people  are like,  well,  the time I broke  in a house  and I had to clock  the old lady  over the head  with a fucking wrench.  So,  you know,  the mom was there  so we raped  the shit out of her.  And then,  you know,  just kids though.  Look,  we had to cover our tracks  so we burned the house down.  Yeah,  we burned the house down.  Just we're waiting  to what you guys  were talking about.  And,  yeah.  Jesus Christ.  So then we,  it was a short,  I think,  yeah,  a short shootout 
[02:48:30]  with the cops.  Then we grabbed  the car that we stole.  We,  well,  we did,  I did the male thing  for a little while  but that's like,  that's crazy shit.  And you went to girls  What were you doing  with the male?  Oh,  were you stealing checks?  No,  not that bad.  Christmas cards  with money in them?  Yeah,  stuff like that.  You always knew  which ones had the money in it.  Oh,  yeah,  well,  the Christmas cards.  That was very,  very short lived. 
[02:49:00]  That,  that was fucking,  now you're getting crazy.  Yeah.  How about this?  Because I had a,  I had a paper route  so I was like,  huh.  But I wouldn't take it  from the houses  that I,  with delivering papers  to.  There were all those  assholes that didn't  want the paper.  Right.  So,  you know,  and everyone knew  I should be in the neighborhood  so they wouldn't  question anything.  No suspicion.  That was short lived.  I want to go on record.  That one was really short lived.  That was like,  this is nuts.  How about this?  This is crazy.  Yeah,  that's kind of,  how about the people, 
[02:49:30]  how about they send you.  No,  what about the house  you broke into?  Oh,  right,  Rich.  Well,  when we broke,  like,  they used to let us  use the trampoline.  We'd get off the bus  and get on the trampoline  and play in their backyard  because they had a big  fucking mansion.  And then I think,  I don't know,  it was me and Alvin  or me or Stanley.  Alvin or Stanley.  Alvin and Stanley.  Fucking Bowery boys.  Who are you out with?  The little rascals?  I don't know.  We go,  let's get in,  let's go inside  and see what we can  fucking find.  Yeah.  And we're walking around 
[02:50:00]  and,  you know,  and then we,  I said,  fuck it,  let's just get something  here.  We went in the kitchen.  You're one of those thieves.  We didn't know  what to really steal.  You know,  we saw some cool  Hot Wheels and shit,  but,  you know,  we weren't old enough  to go look for jewelry.  Or you wouldn't even know,  the thing is,  you wouldn't know  where to off it.  Yeah,  we weren't old enough.  Kids don't have fences.  We were only in  sixth and seventh grade.  You know,  we were just doing  our first B&E.  Where do you find  a favorite B&E?  You know,  so I think we ended up  making sandwiches. 
[02:50:30]  Fuck that.  We made some sandwiches.  No way.  You stole sandwiches then.  We made sandwiches  and then I think  there was a maid  was there in sauce  or something,  so we ran.  Oh boy.  And,  you know,  it's fucking,  you know,  I mean,  it was kind of mean  because they did let us  use the trampoline.  But you would think  if they let us use  the trampoline,  they wouldn't have  refreshments out there  for us.  You'd think.  You would think.  I'll tell you the scam  that we,  I don't know what  these greeting card companies  and flower seeds  that they wanted you 
[02:51:00]  to sell.  Do they,  like,  like you would,  they would send you  this whole big kit.  I remember the flower seed one.  I didn't do it,  but I remember it.  Yeah.  Did they really think  they were going to get  their money?  What the fuck?  Who sends it?  You were supposed to sell them  and then send them the money?  What kind of fucking  dealers are they?  What did you get out of it?  Like,  what were you supposed  to get out of it?  I don't know.  I got everything out of it.  Everything I sold,  I got out of it.  Like,  they were supposed  to take their cut?  That's funny. 
[02:51:30]  Send it up to them  or they send the flower seed guy  to come and fucking  take a few teeth out.  Well,  that's what's wrong  with the school system.  You know,  they have these,  they tell little kids,  don't talk to strangers.  And,  you know,  you raise your kids  that way,  don't go,  but all these schools  have these kids  selling candy  and going,  you know,  going fucking  door to door  or cookies  or this and that.  You know,  buy,  come on in,  you know.  I don't want my kids  selling shit  for your school.  Yeah,  yeah.  You get your fucking  taxes from me,  why should my kid 
[02:52:00]  be out selling  for your fucked up school?  Jesus.  You know what I mean?  Yeah,  yeah,  I've already put in my shit.  I don't pimp my fucking kid  out.  Yeah,  whoever sells the most,  you know,  and you get a fucking  prize or a award,  go fuck yourself.  You gotta take a break.  We got the British Open on.  Yeah.  And Phil Mickelson's  minus three.  He's on 18.  Marco Muir is leading  at minus six  after nine holes. 
[02:52:30]  Holy fuck.  Zach Johnson minus five  after 15.  But more importantly,  they just showed  Rory McIlroy,  Rich?  Rich is back on.  He's plus seven.  He's having a meltdown.  Oh,  Rory.  What happened?  What,  he couldn't take the pressure  of everyone thinking  he was so good?  He stinks now.  He's doing a fucking  Duval or something.  Right.  He's doing a fucking  Duval.  That fucking,  that big,  that endorsement deal  probably fucked his head up.  Oh.  Switching clubs  and doing all this 
[02:53:00]  and all that pressure.  Plus seven,  first round of the  British Open.  He doesn't have a shot  already.  If he doesn't make  the fucking cut  in the British Open.  I don't think he has  a chance at that  plus seven.  All right.  Rich Voss is at  Levity Live this weekend.  Friday,  Saturday,  and Sunday.  It's a great,  great club.  Where is it again?  Palisades Mall?  Yeah.  Nyack.  In Nyack?  Go check out  Rich Voss this weekend.  Please do that.  He's a very,  very funny man.  And we'll be back.  You might have heard us 
[02:53:30]  say what an idiot  during Anthony's live read.  I wasn't talking about Anthony.  We're watching the British Open  and of course Phil Mickelson  fucking misses an easy putt  on the 18th hole. 
[02:54:00]  So frustrating to watch.  Golf fans know that.  Why?  You're a big fan of his?  My father-in-law.  That's his guy.  My guy's kind of Tiger Woods.  No stretch there.  I understand.  What?  I keep hearing Tiger Woods  his name.  Do you think he has a chance  to win this thing?  He's the favorite.  He's always the favorite.  I know.  I don't know.  He's won four tournaments  this year.  He's already won four.  It's in his head though.  The majors.  He can't figure out.  He hasn't won a major  in how many years now?  It's been a long time. 
[02:54:30]  Six or five-ish.  Let's say hi to Joe DeRosa.  Joe!  Hey, Joe.  Hi, guys.  I know.  I know.  That's...  I know.  You're a little...  I get it.  But let me tell you this much, Joe.  You're a little...  You're a little wishy-washy  on the phone  because you think  we're going to attack you.  No, I'm not wishy-washy.  Somebody texted me  and said,  you're getting killed  on the show right now  because of your tattoo.  And I started laughing. 
[02:55:00]  It's like...  Like, being a part of the show  sometimes,  it's like you're a doctor  on call.  Like, you're just trying to sleep  and then your buzzer  starts going off,  going,  you're getting trashed.  You got to call in.  I'm going to get it covered.  I know I made a mistake.  Joe, but it's not really  coming from me.  Anthony is amazed by...  We filled him in  because he wasn't here  the other day.  Right.  And, Joe,  as you know,  I'm a big Joe DeRosa fan.  And, you know, 
[02:55:30]  even the letters,  if that's what you like,  if that's personal,  there's nothing wrong with it.  But the cigarette  mic's microphone,  the fucking...  The framing  and the letterwork,  like, what the fuck?  Is that a microphone?  And...  Is that a microphone  or a cigarette?  What is that?  That...  You know,  because we're all  trying to guess.  Oh, no, we know  because he told us.  It's not done yet, Rich.  Oh, now he's going  with the it's not done yet. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, Joe.  Rich, I still have to get  blue clouds put all around.  Listen, let me...  Oh, shit.  Oh, it's hot!  Here's the visual...  Okay, here's the set.  Here's what you could do.  You could go after my tattoo,  but this is a work of art.  Okay?  Yours...  And I liked when you had the idea,  yours looks like  some epileptic  wrote those fucking letters.  All right?  I'm just saying  it's not a bad idea.  It's not very nice and inclusive.  No, it's not a bad idea.  It's the work. 
[02:56:30]  I'm looking at the work.  Look, your tattoo  is not a work of art, Rich.  It's a good tattoo.  Yeah.  It's a good tattoo.  Are you saying this?  It's not a work of art.  It's a work of art.  It's a pin-up girl.  Nah, it's a good tattoo.  Okay, it's a good tattoo.  I've seen better pin-up tattoos.  But no one has...  No one has...  I wouldn't put it  in the bad tattoo category.  No.  Not at all.  I would rather have actual pins  stuck into my arm  than that pin-up.  You did when you got that tattoo.  Oh.  When fucking Indian ink  got the end of them.  Indian ink. 
[02:57:00]  I know, but I think  I might have said filmed  instead of filled.  Indian ink.  Indian.  Yes, Joe.  India.  You said Anthony...  What did Anthony...  Anthony...  He's...  Rich talked when  Opie was going to tell me  what you said.  All right, well, here's the deal.  You know, when I carry on,  you're like,  oh, there's Opie carrying on.  But when Ant, you know,  comments about something,  it's got to hurt a little more.  And he's pretty much amazed  by what you have on your arm.  He can't believe it.  He's in the 
[02:57:30]  I can't believe it category.  Joe, when you're at the supermarket  and your arm slips by the register,  do you have to pay an extra $4?  Joe, I'm just wondering.  Like, I understand the concept  of it and everything  and initially when you got it  and everything,  but why just such stark block letters  and not like some wonderful,  like, what is it,  cursive writing  or some calligraphy  or something? 
[02:58:00]  There's two K's in your tattoo  and they don't even...  The K's don't even match up.  I know.  My only defense is  you've seen the way I drink.  Oh my God.  No, you're too old  to be the drunk guy  that got a tattoo.  If that was the case  and you would have  the leprechaun on your arm,  the French guy.  I wasn't drunk.  I wasn't drunk.  You just lost the leprechaun people.  I don't know if I want  to clear his headspace  is all I'm saying.  You know,  maybe there's a little bit of a...  Did you get the idea  for this tattoo 
[02:58:30]  from an oak tree?  This would literally look better  if I just put my arm  onto the grill  at Anthony's house.  It kind of looks like that.  Oh, Joe,  I'm just...  Are you very unhappy  with this thing now?  You know what it is?  It's not the artist's fault.  I told him to do it.  You can't use the word artist.  Well, this guy's an artist  who did me.  You can't say artist.  I'm sorry. 
[02:59:00]  I'm sure the guy's  going to be terrific someday.  I'm going to take you.  But he practiced on your arm.  On the afternoon  of the day,  I showed Sam,  because Sam was doing  the same thing,  and I showed him  some of the other stuff  the other guy's done,  and Sam was like,  my God,  he does great stuff.  He goes,  you really made him do that.  It's not his fault.  It's true.  It's like,  this is what I asked him to do,  and he was kind enough  to accommodate.  Did he pay you back  with a tattoo  when you picked him up  the other day from prison?  And he goes, 
[02:59:30]  you know what,  let me do a tattoo.  Now, Joe,  are you doing anything else  with this  to try to fix it?  Huh?  It's a bug.  Well, I'm holding  a cigarette right now.  I want to take that.  I want to take that to it.  Yeah.  I mean,  are there regrets?  Yeah, I mean,  I had a few.  I just didn't think it through.  So, I'm a very impulsive person  with these things,  and it's a bad idea. 
[03:00:00]  Tattoos are bad  to be impulsive with.  At least your Ghostbuster  tattoo looks pretty good.  I know you're not serious,  Opie.  I know you're making fun  of that tattoo tattoo.  Or Ghostbusters.  I didn't see the Ghostbuster one yet.  It's good.  It looks just like,  you know,  the symbol.  He did that one right.  That would be worse.  The only way my tattoos  would be worse  is if I got a tattoo  of Tattoo  in Fantasy Island  on my arm.  That's the only way  these things could look  any stupider. 
[03:00:30]  What did he say?  If you got a tattoo?  Nothing.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Now he,  he even worked on his defense  before he called.  Okay.  And he goes,  maybe I'll use this one.  And he thought  he could slip it in.  So that just got crossed  off the defense paper.  I apologize.  I don't know what to do.  I'm going to tell you  what to do.  Listen to me  because I'm older.  I got fucking nice tattoos.  I got pieces.  It works hard.  I'm going to take you  to a guy  in Jersey, 
[03:01:00]  Flemington.  Oh, here he goes.  I'm not plugging the guy.  I'm not plugging him.  I'm helping.  That's two.  That's more than two.  Well, I can't do it this week  because I'm at Levity.  Oh my God.  Levity Live.  Let me see your tattoo.  Whether you like it or not,  it's good work.  That's a good tattoo.  Let me see again.  And not only that,  this one he did up here,  he fixed yesterday.  He turned it around.  He completely turned  the roses around.  When you see these, Joe,  the new stuff he did yesterday. 
[03:01:30]  I'm just saying  because he's been around.  I don't like the blue clouds.  They're not clouds.  They're what do you call it?  They're old.  They're not like  supposed to be clouds  in the sky.  They're tattoo clouds  to bring out the girl.  If the girl  was just standing there alone,  it would look ridiculous.  Now, this is just to bring.  It's better with those  with a cotton candy swirl around.  But see,  the difference between  the cotton candy  and your tattoo is,  okay,  I'm not going to get beat up  walking through Harlem. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, neither are you  because you put a cigarette  around it now.  Okay.  Hey,  no,  this is a Newport.  I don't know.  Here's the thing,  Joe,  you're getting some good lines in,  but you're going to lose  the tattoo battle.  I have to tell you.  I know.  Look,  I don't know what to do  because,  and Rich got that,  Rich,  you got that one cover-up  on that TV show  and it looks good.  No,  no,  no,  no.  It's redone.  Now it looks like  it's supposed to. 
[03:02:30]  You'll see it.  I'll show it you.  Now,  it was redone yesterday  because what was done  on that show  was pretty much  not satisfactory.  You'll see it now  because this guy  redid it yesterday.  It was better than it was,  though.  Yeah,  but you'll,  I'm telling you,  this guy,  I did this yesterday,  it doesn't,  he,  this guy,  he didn't even bleed.  I'm just saying.  I'm wondering  what Joe can do.  Joe's tattoo so bad  my arm bled  when they did his tattoo. 
[03:03:00]  I wonder if they,  I think Joe needs  to give up  on the George Carlin  thing,  first of all.  Yeah,  yeah,  stop trying to fix it.  Yeah,  let's give up  on the George Carlin  quote that he said  to you  and probably  thousands of others.  And let's,  let's just turn it  into something  completely different.  Well,  here's,  here's,  here's the thing  that I don't,  where I'm stuck.  This is the problem  is I actually thought  Rich's rose thing  looked good initially.  I didn't think  it looked bad.  But the problem  is I don't,  that's the only thing  you could do  to cover something up  is get like a giant 
[03:03:30]  flower.  No,  that's not true.  There's a million things  you can cover that up with.  I'm telling you,  there's a million things.  The rose is the big  cover up flower.  Joe's right.  It is,  right?  Yeah.  But your tattoo  isn't that big.  Your tattoo  could be covered up with,  you could even put a ship  where you're going to be  ended up working anyhow.  So if you want to do  something that has meaning,  put like a little,  you know,  put like carnival,  cruise ship,  and they have you  on top waving,  you know,  goodbye.  Maybe you could borrow  some of your blue 
[03:04:00]  fluffy clouds  to put above  the fucking cruise ship.  You know what?  I can get this  covered up today  in three minutes.  Rich,  I'll come over  to the studio  and have you  talk over it.  You know,  this isn't personal  attacks.  You don't have to go  after me.  I'm here to help you.  I know.  You know,  you can't,  that's your problem.  You don't like to,  you don't know when  people care and want  to help Joe DeRosa  because there's so much 
[03:04:30]  to work on you with.  I mean,  it goes past the tattoo.  I mean,  we don't even want to  get into the whole  mental and all that  shit.  That's,  that's later.  Let's fix the easy  stuff first  and then we'll get,  maybe we will work  on the posture  and then go to  the fucking mall.  Yeah.  So when he put the  mic around the letters,  right?  Yeah.  Were you happy  with that?  It was my idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No,  I know a mic would have, 
[03:05:00]  though that would have  been a good idea,  but whatever this guy  put there,  were you happy with that  as a representation  of a microphone?  And shouldn't there  have been a little  space between the letters  and the microphone?  Because now that  bleeds into the new  design.  Since when do you use  a cordless mic?  Like the end?  Shouldn't there be a space  at the end of the end  before the cigarette  fucking part starts?  It literally,  it literally looks like  a lavalier microphone. 
[03:05:30]  Why?  He couldn't even do  that right.  Oh, Jesus.  Like the top of the T's  are now the border  of the cigarette.  Should there have been  some separation there?  Just put,  just put red,  red in there  and a string  and make it a tampon  because you're a cunt  for putting that  on your arm.  Here,  this is the,  this is the problem  is I don't even,  I showed this to Sam  and I,  like,  I don't even want  to show you guys  what he's supposed  to do  because it's beautiful. 
[03:06:00]  I gotta say.  He showed me  this amazing design  around it  and I was like,  no, no,  it's too much, man.  Let's streamline it.  Let's make it simple.  And then I came up  with this idea  that he was even like,  well, don't you want  me to make it like  more like a,  like an actual mic?  And I was like,  no, no, man.  Keep it abstract.  Oh, no.  Come on.  What an idiot.  I made a mistake.  No, it's not a big deal.  It could be fixed.  I don't know.  It's,  there's so much black ink.  It's not,  yeah, yeah.  That's the other problem.  It's just dark black ink. 
[03:06:30]  It could be fixed.  It could be fixed.  No shading, nothing.  The lettering isn't even nice.  No, it's just,  no.  It's like a branding iron lettering.  Yeah,  I thought that would look cool.  I thought that would look cool.  Circle K Ranch.  But who makes K's like that?  Yeah.  The Ku Klux Klan.  Stupid Brooklyn for three months.  And I was like,  look at everybody expressing themselves.  Oh, God.  Oh, they must love you.  Joe is easily influenced. 
[03:07:00]  I really am.  It's awful.  I like the idea.  I'm surprised.  I'm just,  you know,  I,  it's a great idea  from a great comic.  Thanks, Rich.  Where's the guy in Jersey?  When can we go?  I want to get it done.  This thing's still scabbed over.  I want to get it done now.  No,  you got to wait till it heals  and I'll tell you,  I'll hook it up.  That's the other thing.  Like,  he's not willing to let it scab  and then think about it  and make an appointment  and then maybe like, 
[03:07:30]  even if it takes eight months,  do it then.  Like,  he's like,  oh,  okay,  we got to go to a tattoo place now  and just find somebody  that'll just cover it with something.  No,  you can't cover it  when it's scabbing.  That's what he wants to do.  No,  you,  I know.  He just wants to,  just think of something  off the top of his head again  and just put it on.  Like,  that's never failed him before.  The good news,  Joe,  we'll be wearing long sleeves  in no time,  so.  Oh.  Sam,  winter's right around the corner  and then you'll be okay  for a few months.  Okay. 
[03:08:00]  The reason I don't want to wait  eight months,  Sam,  is because it's another  eight months of trashing.  Get done with.  That's true.  But I think you're going to do something  and you're going to panic.  It's just going to make it worse,  I think.  You fuck up under pressure.  Yeah.  You really do.  You really do.  I swear,  I'm not exaggerating,  guys.  I swear to God,  last night I had a dream  that as this was healing,  like the scabs came off  and then all the,  and as the scabs came off,  the tattoo disappeared 
[03:08:30]  and I remember being so happy  and I was happy.  I had,  I swear,  I had a dream  that you disappeared.  Jesus.  That's really not nice.  Shut up.  Mother Teresa.  Look at his arm.  You got to kick him  when he's down.  That's what this is.  No,  you got to kick him  in the nuts.  Oh,  God.  I'm going to go get a job  at a machinery today 
[03:09:00]  and hope for the best.  You mean at a machine shop?  Yeah,  that it just takes  my arm right off.  All right.  Well,  we're going to get it fixed.  I promise you.  This is my goal now.  I'm taking you under my wings.  I'm not going to be like  Kevin Hart to Keith.  I'm going to be Rich Foster  to Joe DeRosa.  Okay.  Oh,  great.  All right.  All right,  Joe.  Let's go out to Jersey  and fix it.  Yeah.  We're going to fix it.  Good luck.  All right.  That looks like a tough cover-up.  Ant,  come on.  I'm sorry.  I watched those shows 
[03:09:30]  and the way the lines are,  the black ink,  it just,  there's not going to be  many options.  You're going to have to  make it a lot bigger  to cover it up  and then that's going  to look weird on you.  I promise you.  This little simple thing  is going to turn  into an entire forearm piece.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  geez.  Ant,  remember I could have  just jumped in your pool  and ruined it.  Remember I was like,  I can't go in the pool.  The chlorine,  I'm like,  it's a saltwater pool.  And it's a shitty tattoo.  Who cares?  And it's a sucky tattoo.  Yeah,  that fucking tat 
[03:10:00]  would be much better off  in the skimmer.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's going to get better  in two seconds here.  Just put him on hold.  Oh,  sorry.  All right.  Thank you.  Colin Quinn,  everyone.  I don't know if you,  have you been listening  to the show  or do I have to fill you in?  I know what's going on.  Okay.  His voice is only happy  because DeRosa's tattoo  took all the pressure  of his awful,  destroyed his religion tattoo  when he got his  Star of David.  Okay. 
[03:10:30]  Oh,  Rich.  I agree.  Joe goes,  I agree.  Okay.  Colin,  you had time to prepare.  That's what you're  coming on with.  Okay.  Listen,  we're not going to,  we're going to,  we're going to be  as sweet as we can.  We're not going to bring  up Grown Ups 2.  Let's do tattoos now.  We'll do Grown Ups 2  next week.  Okay.  Okay.  That whole cameo  should have been tattooed.  But go ahead.  What were you saying  about Joe DeRosa's tattoo?  Tattooed or covered up 
[03:11:00]  maybe or something?  All right.  It almost worked.  He was fucking,  Calma was brilliant.  I'm telling you,  he did this Dairy Queen scene.  It was fucking brilliant.  I'm telling you,  I'm telling you,  I'm sure,  it,  like,  if he doesn't win  an Oscar,  I'm telling you,  if he doesn't get  the next Joe DeRosa  short from that.  Holy shit.  Hey, man,  I was in one of those.  I was showing  this phone call, 
[03:11:30]  go,  what happened to Joe's  burgeoning film  director career  from that,  Joe?  He was swaggering around,  chest out,  proud of the peacock,  and nothing.  Yeah,  yelling and screaming,  ruining relationships.  We thought at least  in the end  it would lead  to something,  Joe.  Yeah.  Well,  a film's only  as good as it's cast.  I think we should  make a film  about Joe  getting his tattoo.  And what do you,  I'm curious about 
[03:12:00]  the tattoo for one thing.  What do you think  it was going to bring you?  Is it called  George Carlin  type fucking power?  I thought I didn't  leave a creep.  Hey,  why don't you tattoo  a big S  on your chest,  Joe?  Rich is the only guy  that can add  extra S's  to the letter S.  Oh,  he got you there.  That's a knockout punch. 
[03:12:30]  Did George Carlin  ever find out  about the tattoo?  No,  he died  before I got it.  He would have  fucking got it  tattooed  in order of protection  on his fucking arm.  Colin,  to bring you up to speed,  so it's what,  keep kicking them  in the nuts,  something George Carlin  said to Joe DeRosa  on a phone  as Joe's calling  his buddy's  college radio show,  by the way.  Yeah,  it wasn't even live.  And he thought  it was a special moment  he had with him  and Mr. Carlin. 
[03:13:00]  Then it turns out  our own E-Rock  had a headshot  signed by George Carlin  and it said,  kick them in the nuts.  But you know what?  So basically,  George Carlin  said this to everybody.  It wasn't a special moment.  Go beyond that.  That's not that.  Joe called in to go,  hey,  Mr. Carlin,  I'm also a comic too  starting out.  Any advice?  And that's,  yeah,  kick them in the nuts,  kid.  You know,  he didn't think  the kid was going  to go out  and brand his arm  like that. 
[03:13:30]  Jesus.  Once again,  that was the part  we all knew  two weeks ago.  Thanks, Rich.  The E-Rock thing  is new information.  Thank you.  I appreciate you.  Thanks for acknowledging  I brought something  new to the same story.  Did you see  Rich Voss' new tattoo?  He's got a pinup girl  on his forearm now.  I know.  I heard about that.  You heard about it.  You were sitting  right next to it  after the premiere.  I guess your mind  was on other things 
[03:14:00]  like how you're going  to save your career.  Jesus.  Wow.  Jesus.  Jesus.  He's a big,  he's in a big  Hollywood motion picture.  He did 40.  And that's not good  enough for you  fucking people.  41 million dollars.  I'm only laughing  because Joe and Rich,  while the rest of us  are living the high life  in the industry  in Montreal,  Joe and Rich  are going to be  at various shit gigs.  I'm going to be  at Montreal,  coward. 
[03:14:30]  Oh,  shit.  Oh,  yeah.  He's just boss  by himself.  You know what?  I was just going to  come to your defense  and attack Rich  and you threw it  on me.  Okay,  now.  But I'll say it anyway.  You know,  Rich,  leave Colin alone.  All right?  He's doing the acting  work he can get.  Not all of us  have a wife  that'll put us  in her movie.  If boss  wasn't involved,  that movie  would have been  on fucking 
[03:15:00]  HBO  and Showtime  and finish.  You're a curse.  Hopefully,  hopefully not  like you're special.  When you guys  are in Montreal,  oh,  yeah,  what am I?  I'll be  script consulting,  but  and you guys  will all be up there.  By the way,  I like the fact  that that was  your big secret  and now suddenly  you're throwing  that fucking  creditor.  Two weeks ago,  it's like,  don't.  I'm not supposed  to talk.  Now you're on the way.  I'll be script consulting. 
[03:15:30]  Oh,  yeah,  you know.  You're a creep.  And I'll tell you what,  every time you walk  in the room,  like at that premiere  when you walked  in the room  with Bonnie,  it reminded me  of fucking Star 80.  I swear to God.  And when you walked  in,  you reminded me  of Gary Busey.  Nothing.  I gotta go.  Why would you try?  Hard to follow that.  Give Colin  the fucking stage  for a moment.  Colin kills.  You can't,  you know,  when he's on fire. 
[03:16:00]  I was on fire  the other day.  He kills.  You can't beat Colin.  It was good  when it was just  me and DeRosa,  you know.  But then,  you know,  fuck.  And the Gary Busey  thing really fucking  hurt,  by the way.  Oh,  no.  He just spilled  all his drink  on his body  and it looks better 
[03:16:30]  than DeRosa's tattoo.  I think we're  going to get  this tattooed.  What is that?  A big vegetable juice?  Fucking beets  and carrots  and fucking...  Every drop of it  is out of the cup.  It looks like  I just puked on myself.  And it was a heap  in health  and that's a big cup.  Because I found  some kind of fucking...  Look what I found in it.  So it's creeping me out.  What is that?  I don't know.  Good thing you didn't  drink it.  Hey, you guys.  What are you doing later?  After I'm done  with the movie today,  I'm staying in New York. 
[03:17:00]  We could all hang out.  Oh, after I'm done  with the movie.  See what he did there?  He doesn't care.  He doesn't want to  hang out with you guys.  He figured that was  a great way to plug  the fact that he's...  No, I'm staying...  I got a hotel  downtown by Colin.  I mean,  not that far downtown.  I'm not...  I'm not going to  say it on the air.  In Soho.  You think I'm going  to tell these animals  where I'm staying?  Why?  You think you're going  to have a Justin Bieber  moment?  No, I'm going to have  all the girls  going to be hanging  outside your hotel.  First of all,  don't act like you 
[03:17:30]  have girls listening.  I'm going to have  animals calling  at three in the morning  if I told what hotel  I was in.  What kind of shit hotel  are you staying in  that somebody could  just call and go  Rich Vosley  and bring the root  of your root?  Any hotel you call  and answer...  You just answered  the question right there.  The kind of shit hotel  where you can call up  and make the Vosley  stay in there.  Rich, what are you  doing on this movie?  Oh, Jesus.  Why would you play  into his hands? 
[03:18:00]  Nothing.  I'm just...  I'm not.  I was trying to...  I was trying to...  I just wanted to hear...  He's diverting attention.  I'm a script consultant again.  Yeah, all right.  Trying to divert attention.  No, it's not important.  Yeah, it's not important.  He told us  he's pumping up  Chris Rock's lines.  I am not.  I'm a script consultant.  You told us  you're pumping up  something.  Oh, yeah.  You love saying that.  It's a...  Oh.  You love saying  the word consultant  because you feel  like everyone's like,  oh, I guess  he's kind of intelligent.  By the way, 
[03:18:30]  consultant means  we don't feel like  paying writer's wages.  Oh, yeah.  How much is your  flight to Montreal?  I don't know.  How do I know?  Because you're paying it.  Oh, no.  Joe's flying himself  up and schmooze  to the industry.  Is that what's going on?  No, he's...  No.  He's going up...  He's not invited  to Montreal.  No, he is.  He's carpooling  with Big Jay  and Metzger.  They're renting a car  and... 
[03:19:00]  Are they really?  Yeah, him,  Metzger,  and Dan Soda.  They're all driving up  and they're having...  I think Joe's  going to make  the sandwiches.  And...  You should be...  Hey, you should  actually be up there  because you've got  what, you know,  Canadians love that  like 70s hockey player  fucking spray tan  and kind of  half a mullet look.  Yeah, that deserves...  That deserves  a little more.  I hope so. 
[03:19:30]  Get everything  cleaned up over there?  Wow.  Ah, kind of.  We might go off the air  because this thing is bad.  Listen, I've got to run  these guys.  I've got to lift this thing up.  All right, guys.  These guys are  bumming me out.  All right, Colin,  what do you got going on?  What's the big one?  The one-man show,  Unconstitutional?  Yeah, I'm still harassing  people with Unconstitutional,  believe it or not.  It's going well?  Yeah, it's going quite lovely.  Quite lovely.  It's a great, great show, man.  It's at the Cherry...  It's going like hotcakes.  What is it?  The Cherry...  I forget the...  Cherry...  Cherry Lane.  Yeah, okay.  Cherry Lane Theater. 
[03:20:00]  It says Cherry's Jubilee.  Yeah.  Jubilee, of course.  Seriously, it's a great show, man.  Aren't you putting it up  in one of Al Martin's rooms?  Yes, I am, right?  Yes, actually.  These guys are going inside.  I really want to see it.  Joe, we'll see you  in Montreal next week, right?  The whole world's going  to Montreal but me.  I'm in Gotham Friday  and Saturday night,  if anybody's in room.  All right.  How about Joe's...  How about Joe's  half-assed, desultory,  I really want to see it?  No, I really...  Because, you know what?  Go to the fucking acting class 
[03:20:30]  and say,  I really want to see it.  Fucking creep.  I swear to God, I swear to God...  Shut up, Joe.  I was afraid to go  to the enthusiasm  if you can't help me.  Stop.  Stop.  Oh, my God.  All right, you wacky guys.  Levity this weekend.  All right, thanks, guys.  Colin Quinn and Joe DeRosa  on the phone.  Fucking Colin's too funny.  You can't fucking...  He's quick, dude.  He's the quickest, funniest  human being on the planet.  Yeah, I love Colin.  And Rich is going to be  at Levity Live.  Fucking mind. 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  Listen to my wife  hates me, son.  And my wife hates me  on Riotcast,  a fine podcast.  Absolutely.  Oh, shit.  You guys are always  in the top fucking ten.  Oh, well.  Yeah, it's a big deal,  that podcast.  We got our podcast,  number ten,  came out yesterday.  Oh, yeah, the tenth one?  Yep, Stalker Patty,  Mousetraps,  and we threw a bunch of porno  on the sidewalks,  and then from above,  we broadcast as people  were picking up...  Is your podcast  like the best of? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  No one hosts it?  People are bitching about that.  No one...  Why?  It's extra stuff of you  that you can listen to.  Well, it's stuff  that we just can't get to  as much these days,  because we got like  eight years of material now.  And it's also for people  that don't get the channel.  Right.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Who are we complaining about?  But they're bitching,  they're like,  it's not a podcast,  because you're playing,  you know, old stuff.  Walk them.  We're playing old stuff.  Walk them.  It's going very well,  and I appreciate everyone  that is downloading it  and spreading the word  that we're now 
[03:22:00]  in the podcast world as well.  All right.  Good.  Oh, by the way,  hitting the theaters  everywhere this Friday,  that was smooth,  is the new action comedy  from Universal Pictures,  R.I.P.D.,  based on the comic book  from Peter M. Linker.  R.I.P.D. tells the story  of a recently slain cop  who joins a team  of undead police officers  working for the  Rest and Peace Department  trying to find the man 
[03:22:30]  who murdered him.  Jeff Bridges  and Ryan Reynolds  star as the greatest cops  that ever lived  and died.  As members of the R.I.P.D.,  Nick Walters,  played by Ryan Reynolds,  and Roy Powell,  played by Jeff Bridges,  are sworn to protect  and serve the living  from bad souls  that escape the afterlife.  Jeff Bridges  and Ryan Reynolds  make the perfect team.  The movie's produced  by Robert Schwenke, 
[03:23:00]  who you may know  from a 21 Jump Street movie.  Hmm?  How about  The Fast and the Furious?  Hmm?  It also stars  Kevin Bacon  and Mary Louise Parker.  R.I.P.D.  opens everywhere this Friday  with early showings  starting on Thursday night.  That's tonight, right?  Yeah.  Don't miss R.I.P.D.  in theaters  and in real 3D.  This week,  R.I.P.D. 
[03:23:30]  is rated PG-13.  Double double bubble.  Opie and Anthony  have left the building,  but there's still more horses  to come.  After ONA Live  with Sam Roberts  is next.  This  is  after  Opie and Anthony  live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts. 
[03:24:00]  Right.  Don't nobody give a fuck.  It's the after show.  With me,  everybody's still  hanging around.  We're talking about tattoos.  What were you saying, Opie?  No, my point is,  like, you know,  when people get tattoos,  Troy A. Kwan's thinking  about getting a neck tattoo.  And then the argument,  the dumbest argument ever.  People go,  well, what about  when you get older? 
[03:24:30]  Right.  The fact is,  when you get older,  you don't give a fuck.  You give a fuck at this age.  I could see.  But you're not going to give  a shit if you have tattoos  when you're in your 60s  or 70s.  Who cares?  If you're 18, 19,  and you're like,  yeah, I'm going to get a neck tattoo,  that's like,  all right,  but that's a lot of commitment  to saying,  you know,  I'm not going to get a career  doing this or that  or this or that.  But when you're 30,  it's like you kind of know  what you're doing  at that point.  And at 18,  what I thought was cool 
[03:25:00]  to get tattooed on me at 18  was not cool at my age now.  Right.  So,  if you're at 18,  you really have to think about  who you're going to  and what you're getting.  Not true.  Because you were just saying  how it's so easy  to remove the tattoos.  Well, now it is, yeah.  So you can pretty much  have it erased  in a few sittings.  Yeah.  That wasn't the case  when I was coming up, man.  You had a tattoo.  You stuck with it.  You were fucked.  Yeah.  It was really tough  to get that shit off your skin.  Even though it's doable,  it's still expensive and painful.  It is.  There are a lot of people  who are still stuck  with bad tattoos. 
[03:25:30]  For instance,  Joe DeRosa.  He's fucked.  He's fucked.  And I was talking to Troy  about it, too.  It's so obvious  that Joe doesn't want  to spend any time  under the needle.  That's why he's got, like,  scattered, terrible tattoos  throughout his arms.  Yeah, and I just don't,  you know,  maybe he's just not  a creative person.  Maybe not.  You know,  where it's like,  you have to sort of  think about what you want  and you have to take some time  and figure out  what artists you want  to go to and do research.  Yeah.  Like, if you like,  like, traditional,  traditional tattoo work, 
[03:26:00]  you research traditional  tattoo artists.  Or if you like biomechanical,  you research,  and you go,  oh, when's your next opening?  Oh, it's not for another  eight months.  Okay, here's a deposit.  This tattoo's gonna be  with me for the rest of my life.  Because I told you,  with my arm here,  I had to wait  from last September  until now.  And Troy's arm is covered  in kind of modified  old-school tattoo logos  and everything.  Oh, skateboarding.  Old-school skateboarding.  What did I say?  Tattoo logos.  Well, obviously skateboarding then.  But they are tattooed on.  And they look great.  I mean,  you've been getting  nothing but compliments on them 
[03:26:30]  since you came in  to work with them.  Yeah.  But that's the difference  because you came up  with this plan,  and I'm assuming  you spoke to the artist.  Yes.  Talked about what you wanted,  what he could do,  what he'd be good at,  and figured out  where the medium point was.  Like,  I've got the  White Zombie logo  on my arm,  and then I have  Rob Zombie's signature  under it  because I got  the White Zombie logo  first.  Right.  Now I have  Jack White's signature  on my arm.  I want to do  some kind of  White Stripes thing  on it,  but I don't exactly  know what  because they don't have  any real, like,  graphic thing 
[03:27:00]  that you can just  put on there  that looks  specifically cool.  Maybe I'll get, like,  an elephant  because their album  was called Elephant.  I don't know.  Yeah, or the album  got an album cover  behind it sort of,  like,  washed out.  Something.  You know?  But I've had it  for, like, a year  and I'm in no rush  because at some point  I'll come up  with something  that's good.  You know what I mean?  I'm not just gonna be like,  I gotta get something now!  And if anybody  busts your balls for it,  it's like,  well,  that's what you wanted.  It's exactly, I mean...  It's on your body  because you wanted it there.  Joe has to put up with it  and he doesn't even  want it there.  Like, that's gotta suck.  Like, this is, 
[03:27:30]  regardless of what  your feelings are on it,  it's,  I thought about it.  Right.  I came to the conclusion  it's exactly what I wanted.  It looks exactly  how I want it to look  and it's,  it's,  it's a memory  of an actual experience  that actually  has meaning to it.  Yeah.  I think you could do  something cool around it.  I think so, too.  Yeah.  You know?  But yeah, Joe's fucked.  Joe is fucked.  And I'm glad it came up  on the air again today  because he's super fucked.  And it teaches people  a lesson  that  you gotta think about,  like, tattooing,  everybody gets tattoos now. 
[03:28:00]  And that's the other thing  I was saying,  that Obie was saying,  you know,  when you get older,  you're not gonna give a fuck anyway.  But regardless,  like, people say,  isn't it gonna look silly  when you're, like,  60, 70 years old  and you got a neck tattoo?  No, because  a ton of 60 or 70 year olds  are gonna have neck tattoos  because a ton of people  now have neck tattoos.  And at 70 years old,  I'll be just happy  to be alive.  Right.  And breathing.  Yeah.  You don't care  what's on your neck  as long as there's air  going through it.  You know what I mean?  Like, you look at some old people  and it's like,  they got worse things  going on than tattoos. 
[03:28:30]  I knew a woman  who got her first tattoo  at, like, 80.  She got a rose tattooed  on her titty.  And I was like,  yeah, you're awesome.  Titty tattoos are the worst.  Especially at 80.  Yeah.  But at least,  at least she didn't watch it,  like, become this decrepit,  you know,  shriveled up rose.  That was when I was 80, so.  And these girls,  like, these young,  like, 18, 19-year-old girls  will get this hot thing  on their stomach.  Jackie's out of the studio  right now.  Sydney, don't tell her  we said this.  She's got a giant  sort of thing on her back.  And it means something  to her grandma  and it's a nice thing  or anything. 
[03:29:00]  But that's not going  to age well,  I don't think.  Well, back isn't as bad  as the stomach.  Oh.  These girls with these,  like, gorgeous flat stomachs,  I mean, they're not even  thinking about what's going on.  They have something  right in the middle.  They'll get, like,  a C-section scar  right through it.  Your stomach expands.  Yeah.  And the skin stretches.  And when you get back  into shape,  your skin is still modified.  It looks all fucked up.  Yeah.  And, like, people that  have had tattoos  when they were fat  and then lost a lot of weight,  it just looks like  the blob.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[03:29:30]  Bobby the Champ,  former intern of  Opie and Anthony  and Ron and Fez,  is on the phone.  What up, buddy?  What's up, PTSR?  Troy, I got a quick  question for you.  Yeah.  I was looking at your dude  at Kings Avenue  and I was wondering  who you suggest.  I have, like, a big dragon  on my left calf  and I want to do  a sleeve of, like,  koi and, like,  Japanese rosebuds  and stuff with it  because I feel like  it needs something.  So, like, which guy  do you suggest  at that place  or do you have  a different guy  or, you know,  what do you think?  Everybody at Kings Avenue  is amazing,  but I go to 
[03:30:00]  Justin Weatherholtz  and he's just sick.  I mean, there's just,  I can't really,  he's on Instagram, too.  You can check out  all his work on that.  Yeah, I was looking  at his Instagram  and I was looking  at his website.  He did, like,  a sick Salvador Dali.  Like, he does a lot  of faces,  so that's why  I wasn't sure  maybe if I should  go to him  for some sort of,  like, Japanese scene.  But, I mean,  I'm sure he could  do anything, obviously,  but I wanted to go  to a specialist.  Yeah, he's definitely,  he's diverse and,  you know,  just tell him that  you heard it on the show,  so I'm sure he'll  try to squeeze in.  He's got a tight schedule,  but...  Yeah, you know,  that's another thing, too.  I didn't want to do it  immediately. 
[03:30:30]  I want to, you know,  go for a consultation,  think about it,  pay it little by little,  and then eventually  go in for the whole  big piece.  Yeah, and it's cool  because, you know,  if you give him  a deposit,  you can start  seeing the drawing  and you can sort of  work with it a little bit  and spend some time  with it,  and it's,  especially, like,  if you have months  to go before you  get the tattoo,  you can really  think about it.  It's like,  okay, I want this.  So when you have  months before  the appointment itself,  do they send you  the drawings,  like, months before?  Like, is it a process  or do you show up  after eight months  and say,  okay, let's start,  okay, here's the drawing, 
[03:31:00]  all right, let's go?  I put the deposit down  and then I knew  what I wanted to do  and then I started  getting together  all my artwork  and I went through,  like, all the old  skateboard graphics,  especially the decks  that I had as a kid.  Yeah.  And I was like,  I like this one,  I like this one,  and I started  narrowing it down.  Okay, I definitely  want this one,  this one's maybe,  narrowed it down  and then when I  finally got to it,  I took it to him  and then we started  going over it  and then you get it.  But this was,  like, days and days  and days before.  Yeah, this was,  like, probably,  like, a month before  and then you have  a consultation  and then you give 
[03:31:30]  him all your artwork  and he starts  sketching stuff  in front of you  and then he takes,  like, if you have  other tattoos on you,  he sort of sketches out  what, how everything's  going to match up together.  Yeah.  Because everything's  got to work.  Unless you're Joe,  in which case,  just stamp some shit  on wherever.  Well, and I've done  spontaneous, like,  just let's go get  tattooed on a,  Roland was actually  with me the one day.  Me and this girl  Katie Storm,  she got Prince's logo  tattooed behind her ear.  I can't hate on that.  No, and I got this,  I've, I'm a big fan 
[03:32:00]  of the band Clutch,  so I got the Elephant Riders.  It was literally like,  let's just,  we were at brunch  and we're like,  let's just go get tattooed.  Yeah, I have a Creed  tattooed on my,  on my peck.  I, in hindsight,  it wasn't a great decision,  but no.  You know, I don't,  at the time,  I thought Creed was great.  No tattoos for you,  Roland, huh?  We tried to get him  tattooed.  You did?  Yeah.  Hell to the nose.  If you had come,  what were you,  what were you going to  try to get him tattooed?  Anything.  Whatever you wanted.  Would you have paid for it?  Yeah.  No, thank you.  That would have been so funny.  I know.  No, not the pain, no.  Is that what it is?  It's the pain? 
[03:32:30]  The pain, and they come in  and they're like,  oh, why did I get that?  You know that whatever you got,  you come back,  oh, what did I do that for?  I'd be like a DeRosa.  Yeah.  I'd be like all these,  they need cool tattoos,  but people go,  why did you get that?  That's so shitty.  Yeah.  You're out of your arm.  Thinking you were part  of this cool community  and then everybody's like,  no, dude.  I don't know if anybody  could have as shitty  of a tattoo as DeRosa.  I know.  I was trying to make him  feel better if he's listening.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Oh, my God.  Hey, where's Intern Douchebag?  Which one?  He's right here.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bring him in,  because I don't feel like  we got to where 
[03:33:00]  we were going yesterday.  Intern Douchebag came to us yesterday.  We were talking about  some problems  with his love life in college.  Intern Douchebag,  we have two female interns.  You all know them by now,  Jackie and Sydney,  and they've become world famous  because of multiple appearances  on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think each of them  actually now have  more Twitter followers.  Sal, don't they have  more Twitter followers  than you at this point?  I guess so, yeah.  Which is crazy.  Why don't we give out  their Twitter names? 
[03:33:30]  Okay, Sydney,  what's your Twitter name?  It's S-Y-D-D-N-E-Y-M.  So, Sydney, M.  On Twitter.  Okay, and then what's it?  Jackie Nutt with two T's?  I think, yeah.  Is that the other one?  Okay.  Maybe two E's.  And these two  have just become  little shining stars  on the channel  while Intern Douchebag  is just over here like,  come on,  a little something for me?  Am I?  I feel,  well, you should be. 
[03:34:00]  Should I?  Okay, yeah.  Totally, yeah.  That's how I am.  And I was thinking about you.  I feel like I want to offer you  a position.  Okay.  I want to know  if you want to be  the official intern  of after Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, man.  If you want to be that guy.  Because I think,  you know,  Jackie and Sydney  have been getting  a lot of shine lately.  Yeah?  They get a lot of love  on this show.  A lot of love.  Do you want to plug  your Twitter properly, Jackie?  Yeah, Jackie with two E's.  Hold on, wait.  I'm the official intern  of the after show  and then this segment  just gets interrupted  immediately.  I'm just saying, 
[03:34:30]  Opie and Anthony  is a big show.  And we just want to  catch everybody up to speed.  Call yourself that.  Jackie, not two E's,  two T's.  Boom, on Twitter.  Boom.  Now, I do think  that you,  and are you okay  with the nickname  intern douchebag?  I mean, like,  I don't think it matters  if I am or not.  So, yeah.  You're right about that.  Great instincts.  Great instincts.  He's right, Troy.  He is.  He couldn't have  changed anything.  How did you feel?  They were talking,  we were talking today  on the show  and I've been thinking  about this for a little while  because I read  about the case 
[03:35:00]  where a lot of interns  now are complaining  about doing free work.  and I read,  you know,  there are lawsuits.  I think a couple interns  from the movie Black Swan  ended up suing Warner Brothers.  They were older guys, though.  They were like 30  or something like that.  I mean,  but it was there,  I mean,  still,  it was their choice.  We've had an intern  that was 50.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  And I feel like,  to me,  and it's happened  to a bunch of companies  that interns have been suing,  but more in the entertainment business  than anywhere else,  I think. 
[03:35:30]  But I've always felt like  an internship  is an opportunity.  Yeah,  I think especially  in the entertainment industry,  it's like paying my dues.  Like,  all I've been told  this entire time  is that I have to pay my dues,  I have to pay my dues,  I have to put in my hours,  and I'm, like,  pretty hyped  that I get to put them in here.  It's like,  where else are you going to get  a foot in the door?  Yeah.  It's not like,  I can see.  This is the door  I want to have my foot in.  If an internship,  the temp thing,  I kind of understand,  because if the internship  became a regular job 
[03:36:00]  all of a sudden,  and you're still not getting paid,  you're like,  come on,  how many dues  am I paying here?  It seems like I'm just  doing the job now  for free.  But,  I don't understand  the whole idea  of the interns  not liking the fact,  because it's three months,  or six,  if you're doing two semesters,  I don't know,  and you get to  have this opportunity  that you can  or cannot take advantage of.  Yeah.  Like I said on the air,  today,  it's about meeting people.  Mm-hmm.  Even if you're not doing,  even if you're sitting there saying,  I spent three months  getting coffee 
[03:36:30]  for the radio show.  Yeah.  Well, yeah,  but you were surrounded  by the radio show.  You see how it works.  You have it on your resume,  and you've got a building  full of people  that you can potentially  talk to.  Yeah.  All you have to do  is find people  to like you.  Yeah.  Out of college,  you're not going to get hired  any other way  into something like this.  Because why would they?  Right.  Because the only reason  anybody gets jobs  is because somebody likes them.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's why people get hired  because,  or somebody that they like  likes you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or he learns the position, 
[03:37:00]  already knows it,  so instead of training somebody else  and bringing them in,  Right.  He already knows how to do it.  It's like, boom,  you just come in and do it.  Right.  They're not going to pay somebody  to train them.  Right.  Instead,  they'll take an intern,  they'll train them,  and then at the end  of the semester,  if they like you,  maybe you'll get a job.  Yeah.  And I know that there aren't  a lot of Opie and Anthony interns  that have gotten hired  on the Opie and Anthony show,  but let's face it,  for whatever reason,  a lot of wrecks  who have not taken advantage  of this opportunity whatsoever  have ended up interning 
[03:37:30]  for the show.  Yeah.  The fact is,  the company-wide,  at SiriusXM,  they've hired a shit ton  of interns.  Yeah.  Right?  I mean, Troy,  you interned.  How old were you  when you interned?  28.  And who's going to,  you're 28 years old,  you're trying to start  something new,  like a fresh start.  Are you just going to be able  to roll into Sirius  and be like,  yo, can I get a job?  They wouldn't hire me.  Of course not.  No.  So I went back to school,  went to audio school.  I already knew a lot  about audio,  but it was cool  to learn more.  And you have to go to,  you know,  do it to get school credit 
[03:38:00]  for it.  And then,  you know,  when you get in the door,  you're just like,  all right,  I got to fucking,  I got to kick some ass.  Sal,  what was your attitude  when you interned?  It was like a year and a half ago,  I guess,  that you interned.  And as much shit  as you take on the air now,  because as it turned out,  not the strongest staff member  of all time,  but one of the great interns  that we've ever had.  I mean,  and that's something  that you can,  you can,  you know,  put under your belt forever.  Did you see the interns  that you were with  and realize  that they weren't taking advantage 
[03:38:30]  of opportunities  that you were?  Do you think  that you should have gotten paid?  No.  No.  When you're,  when you,  when you want to learn a craft,  no matter what it is,  regardless of if it's radio  or audio  or anything like that  or woodworking,  let's say it's,  you know,  you do it for free for a while  and you,  you act like a bitch  for a very long time.  And it's a matter of getting  your foot in the door too.  If you want to do  what you do  for a giant company  like Sirius XM,  there aren't that many places  to go on radio.  Right.  So you get your foot in the door.  And you got to pay your dues.  Right. 
[03:39:00]  And you got,  all show business.  All show business.  Everybody.  Spielberg,  Katzenberg,  all started as unpaid entrants.  And then what happens?  As an unpaid intern,  somebody goes,  You meet people.  I like this kid.  Yeah.  I don't know what the deal is with him,  but I like this kid.  Yes,  Spielberg started at William Morris  and built his way up.  It's weird though.  And,  but I think,  I think that that goes  with the entitlement  that a lot of kids have now,  which is they feel like,  well,  I'm working,  I'm doing some work.  Somebody should be giving me  some money. 
[03:39:30]  And it's like,  okay,  how about this?  Either take the $12 an hour  or start building something  that could become something.  It's easier to be an intern now  than back in the day.  Way easier.  What are you going to say,  Sal?  Something I noticed too is,  I've seen only a few intern classes  since I've been here,  but I noticed a lot of people  bitch about how like,  oh man,  I got to pay for this  to be here.  You know how much it's costing me.  And if you think about it,  by you paying,  let's say,  your housing  or your transportation  or whatever,  that's like your loan 
[03:40:00]  to the company  in a way  of you're learning the trade,  that's you're paying the company.  You know what a lot of people  won't do?  Make investments  in themselves.  Right.  That's what this is.  Yeah.  You just,  all right,  I got a few bucks saved up.  It's going to cost me money  to work here for a minute,  but I feel like I'm making  an investment in myself  that will pay off.  Yeah.  And if you're actually good  at what you do  and take advantage  of the opportunities,  they can easily pay off.  And you quickly realize 
[03:40:30]  that your college degree,  no one gives a fuck about it.  Oh, man.  I mean, no,  but the point...  I'm spending a lot of money  on that, too.  Yeah, I mean,  that's a waste.  But the reason you go to college  is because you don't get  the internship  if you don't go to college.  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean,  Troy,  you had to enroll  in Connecticut School  of Broadcasting.  No,  it was Institute of Audio Research.  Is it the same type of deal?  No,  I think Connecticut School  of Broadcasting  is more like geared towards  actual broadcasting.  This is more audio.  Because I've known people  who sign up  for Connecticut School 
[03:41:00]  of Broadcasting  just for internship credits.  Never even entered  the state of Connecticut.  Never entered  the state of Connecticut.  Like,  they don't have any interest  in taking any classes.  They're just like,  okay,  well,  if I sign up,  they'll take me  and then I'll get  internship credits.  That's what the college is for.  All right.  Well,  I'm glad I'm here,  then.  I'm glad I'm finally  in my internship zone.  Plus,  at the end of the day,  like,  I graduated from Syracuse.  Who cares, right?  Well,  there are people here  who went to Syracuse.  And now,  all of a sudden,  hey,  Sam,  Syracuse,  right?  I'm like,  yeah,  sure.  Whatever.  Yes, 
[03:41:30]  I hated it  when I was there,  but yeah,  Syracuse,  orange and blue,  baby.  Plus,  I majored in sociology  just so I could  get out of there.  Everybody around here  assumes I went to Newhouse.  It's like the top  communication school  in the country.  I stepped foot  in that building.  Mike in Connecticut.  Sam Roberts,  professional broadcaster.  I think that  Tyler's getting  a better end  of the bargain  on this one.  Yes,  Sidney and Jackie  are the darling  interns of the  O&A program.  But you, 
[03:42:00]  Sam Roberts,  have successfully  navigated going  from intern  to broadcast  superstar,  dare I say.  That's exactly right.  So if you could  follow in your footsteps,  be part of the  after show,  and be even included  on the Sunday program,  which airs at 4 p.m.  on Sundays.  That's right.  At 10.103.  It's good for him.  He's going to be  in a better position.  Hands down.  Great call, Mike.  Great call.  He's right.  If he can stay positive,  and because it's, 
[03:42:30]  I mean,  I'm sure it sucks for him.  You know what I mean?  But if he can stay positive  and put this towards  working harder,  and being determined  to really be like,  to get something out of this,  he's going to do great.  How are things going  with the ladies?  What do you mean by that?  The girls?  Yeah, they're fine.  Okay, because we've spoken  to you,  and how old are you?  I'm 21.  21.  What college do you go to?  I go to Temple University.  Temple.  Okay.  A lot of girls  in that school, right?  Oh, I thought you were  talking about the girl interns.  Oh, no, we're done with them.  Just girls in general? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Girls in general.  Okay, yeah.  You've been with four women  in your life, correct?  Been in the biblical sense, yes.  Biblically.  Yes.  I mean, you've been  in the company  of tons of women.  I'd like to think so, yes.  But in terms of  sexual interaction,  and that's going  all the way with them, right?  I hope my mom's not listening.  That's intercourse.  Yeah.  Correct?  We were talking  about the fact that  you need to  get out there  and realize  that you're in college.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  You consider yourself  more of a relationship-oriented person,  and we were talking  after the show, 
[03:43:30]  yesterday,  and you said  you went for  quality over quantity.  Yeah.  And said you'd been  with one  random hookup chick,  but she was super hot.  Yeah.  FIT girl.  Right.  Yeah, it was awesome.  Nice.  Yeah.  When it's a random hookup chick,  it doesn't really matter  if they're that hot, right?  I mean, like,  I don't know.  I don't, like...  I mean, it's great.  It's better.  Yeah.  I'm really bad  at, like,  holding on to private shames,  so, like,  the idea of, like,  just having something  in my history  that I can't really delete, 
[03:44:00]  like,  that's very attractive.  Tell the story.  Be like,  what you do is you say,  oh, my God,  I made the biggest mistake  this one time,  and tell that story.  Because, I mean,  because I was thinking  about you yesterday,  and Troy gave me the advice.  Yes, I was.  To start, uh,  I believe it was  roundhousing bitches,  is that correct?  Roundhousing bitches was the term.  Yeah, you get good,  you get good with the slobs,  and then you fucking,  that's that way,  when you get the girl,  you're like,  oh, I gotta really step up  to the plate with this bitch.  When I first heard that,  I was like,  that's good advice,  but then I started thinking about it, 
[03:44:30]  and I was like,  wow, when I was, like, 20,  you know,  I wasn't all that comfortable  with women.  It's a little tough  to go from,  well, no, you know,  I'm more of a relationship type,  quantity over quality,  directly to,  all right,  time to start  roundhousing bitches.  But that's not how it works.  When he goes,  when he's in college,  and he's out doing his thing,  and he meets a girl  that's like,  she's okay,  she's okay,  and you think to yourself,  I think I could probably  fuck that bitch.  You know,  and then you're like,  you know,  I'm not gonna,  I don't wanna date her, 
[03:45:00]  I don't,  she's not cute,  she's not really the type  of girl I like,  but she seems interested in me  enough that she'll let me  enter her.  Or,  I don't know if I wanna date her  or not,  but that's not what I'm  worried about right now.  I don't worry about that now,  because I'm young,  I don't give a shit,  whatever.  It's like,  I don't think I do give a shit.  You shouldn't give as much a shit.  Yeah,  I give too much shit,  I think too much,  and I know that that's like  a problem I have  and that I'm dealing with right now.  some people aren't like that,  but I'm just telling you that  at your age,  you should try to get in  as much as you can.  I had a roommate  this past semester,  and his whole attitude  was every Friday  and Saturday night, 
[03:45:30]  he would go out  and he was just like,  I'm gonna get it in.  And he didn't know  where it was gonna be,  but he was gonna get his dick wet,  that was the whole idea.  And I just can't understand  that mindset of like,  I think you need to find  a comfortable medium  because I hear what you're saying.  Yeah.  And I understand that,  you know,  you don't want to go out  every weekend and do this,  you don't,  but you do need to give  less of a fuck.  Okay.  Because I was like you,  I gave lots of fucks.  Mm-hmm.  But then you realized,  especially at your age,  none of it,  nothing matters. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Like the relationships  that you're in now,  they're just gonna end anyway.  Mm-hmm.  So like why go and have,  you have plenty of time  for relationships.  What doesn't happen  is  random hookups  with college chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I was in college,  I was in,  for most of college,  Mm-hmm.  Two major relationships.  Okay.  That left no room  for randos.  Mm-hmm.  And randos are an important part  of being in college,  I think.  I look back now,  and I don't regret 
[03:46:30]  being in the relationships  because, you know,  it brings you to where  you are now,  and I'm happy, you know,  being with my wife  and everything.  But at the same time,  I'm aware that the one  relationship didn't even  need to happen.  Yeah.  The other one could have  ended freshman year,  and I got like three years.  That could have been,  basically.  That's just, yeah.  Hooking up with chicks.  And who,  and in my head,  I'm thinking,  oh yeah,  I would have banged  this hot girl,  I would have banged  that hot girl.  In reality,  Yeah.  I probably would have  sat alone in my dorm room  watching wrestling tapes  wondering why girls 
[03:47:00]  didn't like me,  but.  And I just sit alone  in my room watching Netflix  wondering why my girls  don't like you.  Same thing,  it's just 30 Rock and  community, basically.  But,  you gotta try.  Yeah.  Because otherwise  you'll sit there and be like.  But see,  the thing is,  the thing is too,  is like,  what your roommate does  is,  some guys approach it  like a sport.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That is exactly how  you approach it.  If you go out  and shoot hoops every day,  you're gonna get better  at basketball.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like,  if you go out on a Friday  and you're like,  I am determined to,  I don't care what I get.  I don't give a shit. 
[03:47:30]  Like,  I'm gonna fuck somebody tonight.  It's like,  you just,  you brush up your skills.  So when you go out,  or even as you get older,  and you go meet those,  those girls that you think  are out of your league,  you have more confidence  in approaching them.  So is,  is your concern that like,  I'm not gonna be able,  I'm not gonna be good enough  when the right one comes along  that I need to like,  get my practice in?  Well,  there's a couple,  there's a couple concerns.  There's,  and you,  it's your life,  it's your life.  You can do,  you obviously can do whatever.  Some of this is good.  I think,  you can do whatever you want  with your life,  but,  this is more than an internship,  this is life coaching,  right?  Exactly. 
[03:48:00]  Thank you.  Number one,  you need to take advantage  of being in college,  right?  I mean,  that's,  that's,  I think,  I think,  I think that the goal  is to just not have regrets later.  When you're in,  when you're,  when you find the love of your life,  because you can still think back  and be like,  ah,  it would have been fun though.  The point is to have fun,  and I think maybe  you don't need to practice  having sexual relations  every four days  as much as  just practicing  maybe talking to girls  at first.  I mean,  yeah,  I love,  like,  and that's the other thing.  I'm probably,  I'm stupid. 
[03:48:30]  I like taking girls on dates.  Like,  I'm really,  I'm really into that.  I didn't even know  people do that anymore.  Yeah,  no.  They don't,  right?  It's like,  texting is the date.  Yeah,  I'm awful at texting girls.  Oh my God,  texting girls is impossible.  It's ridiculous.  Okay,  so that's how you gotta brush your skin.  LOL is every single text  they want to send you,  and it's like,  that's not conversation.  No,  be like,  look at that.  I'm hilarious.  This is great.  This girl thinks I'm funny,  and you know what?  I'm supposed to be looking at that  as a good thing.  Humor is an aphrodisiac.  That's what they tell me.  Trust me,  I count on it.  I need humor as an aphrodisiac,  because nothing else is working for me. 
[03:49:00]  Afros aren't.  Brian in Nevada.  Hey,  why are you guys bashing this guy  for having such morals  that we all wish  that we could live up to?  No,  he doesn't,  it's not morals.  It's not morals.  It's a lack of trying,  quite frankly.  And second of all,  we're not bashing him.  We're trying to give him  an opportunity  that he's not gonna grow up  and be like,  you know,  when I was younger,  I probably could've,  yeah,  that would've been fun.  Do morals get you?  Friend zone mansion. 
[03:49:30]  Oh no,  I am king of the friend zone.  I'll say that much.  That's a big...  As you're older,  I have a mansion.  Yeah,  a mansion.  Don't do what I did.  Roland's got tons of friends.  So I had a high hopes for New York  and then I got to my room  and I was the last one  to show up to my room  and now I'm on a top bunk  with no air conditioning  so it's like,  I can't,  I don't know how I would  take a girl back to a top bunk.  I'm a 21-year-old guy.  That's a great question.  That's just something  tough to pull off.  Should I answer that?  Have you done that?  What would you do, Troy?  If I was in his situation? 
[03:50:00]  Two roommates,  top bunk,  no air conditioning.  You find the hotel  near you  that does the hourly rates.  Unpaid internship.  But hourly,  how much is like  an hourly hotel?  Hourly rate,  they have those?  It's like $40 an hour  or something.  You can afford 40 bucks.  You're not going to last  more than an hour.  No, definitely not.  Like you said,  four women.  Trust me.  I understand.  I mean,  if something falls  in your lap, bro,  cough up the 40 bucks.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I mean,  and I get it  and that's not an insult  because guess what?  I'd probably only need 25.  Yeah.  So,  let's go to Art in Pittsburgh. 
[03:50:30]  I got a piece of advice  for all of you guys.  My grandfather gave me  when I went to  my first high school band.  Good.  And he told me,  if you get a chance  to get one tonight,  you take it.  He says,  because if you pass  that one up  and you get two tomorrow,  that's one you're still behind.  Amen.  That's great.  That's a wise man.  You understand that?  Yeah,  but like here,  so I was thinking about  the other day  when you brought it up  because I thought  it might become  a recurring topic,  Tyler Sexlife, 
[03:51:00]  was that,  so my number's four  and like,  I don't know.  By the way,  it's not a horrible number.  Yeah,  and I don't really care about it.  The main thing is that like,  that number can't go down.  It can only go up.  Correct.  You know what I mean?  That's a great attitude.  And so,  I'm hopeful, right?  Right.  But,  I'm thinking about,  I want to get married eventually,  right?  Sure.  And like,  how many guys,  maybe,  I don't know about that.  Yeah,  but it's different for guys  than girls.  Numbers.  I'm not into double standards,  but,  but it is a double standard. 
[03:51:30]  Explain what you were going to say,  because I'm,  all I was thinking about  is that like,  my potential wife,  how many men would have,  I've,  want her to slept with  at that point?  And I know this is,  this is overthinking it again.  Don't get me wrong.  I know,  I know,  I know you're saying  you're not into double standards  because you're in college right now  and you're like,  but there are certain things  that are just existing in the world.  Yeah.  No,  I get that it's a reality.  Yeah.  That double standard  is just something that happens.  Yeah.  Like,  if I met a girl  Yeah.  that had the kind of stories 
[03:52:00]  that Troy tells me  Yeah.  and that gives the kind of advice  that Troy gives,  I would think she was disease ridden.  When I hear from Troy,  I'm like,  that's a cool dude.  You know what I mean?  Like,  that's the guy who knows  what he's talking about.  You gotta understand,  it's completely different.  It's a man is entering the woman.  So,  women are entering,  Dicks do the fucking.  Dicks do the fucking.  That's true.  Women are letting men  enter their bodies.  So,  if there's a million guys in there,  it's like they're inside her body.  Where the guy is just literally  just expelling  and getting it out of his body. 
[03:52:30]  It's like,  it's just releasing the poison  and he's just on with his day.  Right.  I mean,  it's like,  for instance,  you know,  you walk barefoot on the mud.  Okay.  No matter how many feet  have been on the mud,  your feet aren't gonna get more dirty.  That mud's gonna get  a hell of a lot more footprints in it.  Isn't it?  Exactly.  Isn't it?  How do you feel about all this?  About all this advice we're giving you?  Do you think  that,  you know,  trying to get out there  and expand your horizons 
[03:53:00]  as far as women go  is something you want to do?  Or are Troy and me  kind of off the mark?  I'm telling you  in terms of a cautionary tale.  Yeah.  In terms of my experience.  You don't want me to regret.  Yeah.  You're looking out for me.  I don't want to see  happen to you  what happened to me,  quite frankly.  And Troy  is just a guy  who likes to fuck bitches.  So he would just  give that advice to anybody.  For me,  I was late to kiss a girl.  I was late to have sex  the first time.  I get it.  I get it.  But yeah,  that's how it goes.  Believe it or not,  I was there too.  I don't know if you can believe that. 
[03:53:30]  That's why we're in radio.  But you're sitting there  and you're trying,  well no,  we're not in radio.  You're an intern.  I'm in radio.  But go on.  And then  had my first relationships  and all that.  And then since then  I've been trying  to expand a little more  but a lot of girls bore me.  And I think  there's a lot of truth  to what you're saying  that I need to like  stop being concerned  on how interested I am  in a girl  in terms of like  whether or not  I'm going to sexually  pursue her.  You know what I mean?  Like I should just go for it  sometimes just because like  carpe diem. 
[03:54:00]  I'm like yeah  and like why not?  Like just go for it.  I hate to tell you this  but when you're like 30  you're probably not going  to give a fuck  how many guys  your wife has been with.  Yeah.  You'll care who she is  at that moment  but if she slept  with 150 dudes  in college  as long as she's clean  and she's a cool person now  it's probably  like I don't think  it would bother me anymore.  Alright well  you know  does it bother  like is that something  that you think about?  I mean you know  I would definitely prefer  if the numbers  weren't into the hundreds 
[03:54:30]  for a girl.  Especially in that sort of  short period of time  that could have been  an exaggeration  especially if it's  guys that I had known  you had known  every single one.  Yeah that's a little rough.  If it's guys that  you know she was in college  and she just went crazy  whatever.  Yeah whatever.  And she's probably experienced  and she probably knows  how to show you a good time.  That's important to you  isn't it?  Well I mean  we all got to have a good time.  Life is about having a good time.  And this was another thing  that I was thinking about  because I knew  that this might come up again  was I was like crazy 
[03:55:00]  the first girl I had sex  was the first girl  I was in love with right?  And I think that was  a big mistake  because all my friends  that like are just into  like yeah I'm gonna go  get it tonight  like they were guys  that just like  that's how they started  and that's how they did it.  So I still think I  I like associate sex  with like emotional feelings  that like don't really  need to be there.  Exactly.  Yeah no.  I'm with you.  I wish I could  I wish I could like  taper that off.  Even his boo  had a little lisp on it.  You know?  You fuck a couple pigs  they'll taper off  don't worry.  Well think about 
[03:55:30]  what you want.  Yeah.  I don't want to  stir you in the wrong direction.  Alright.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye everybody.
