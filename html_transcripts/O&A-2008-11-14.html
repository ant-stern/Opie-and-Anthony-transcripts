<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the Jets' improbable overtime victory against the Patriots. Opie recounted falling asleep during the game and waking to the win, leading to a debate about the unfairness of the coin toss in overtime football.  Opie then shared a bizarre dream related to the game.  A caller, Matt from Long Island, criticized the game's commentary. This transitioned into a somber discussion of Steve Freed's firing from CBS Radio after 41 years. The hosts expressed outrage at the company's apparent lack of appreciation, relating it to the widespread layoffs at XM and their own station,  highlighted by a large influx of goodbye emails from colleagues and the recent firings of Tom Chiasano and others, including Russell Brand from a UK radio show.  They played Freed’s recorded farewell message, which included a song and heartfelt speech, prompting emotional responses from the hosts.  The discussion expanded to the broader context of corporate layoffs, contrasting Freed’s long tenure with the callous treatment he received and drawing parallels to the massive Wall Street bonuses during the financial crisis. A caller, Morgan, an HR manager, provided insight into industry-wide job insecurity.  The hosts then presented a list of things that didn’t exist when Freed was hired, emphasizing the length of his service.

The show's focus shifted to the anger surrounding Wall Street bonuses, with the hosts using strong language to express their disbelief and speculation on public reaction. They dissected the bailout, highlighting the perceived injustice of using taxpayer money for executive compensation. This segued into hypothetical scenarios involving revolution and humorous, albeit cynical, military tactics.  Ricky Gervais called in, discussing his HBO special and commenting on the Wall Street bailout's absurdity.  Studio guest Rich Voss joined the conversation, which returned to Steve Freed’s final day.  The hosts played recordings of Freed delivering famous farewell speeches (Eisenhower and Napoleon) and interviewed him live. They also discussed the death of a homeless person who had participated in their “homeless shopping sprees” segment. Reviews of "About Schmidt" followed, along with discussions of stand-up comedy in the US and UK, featuring in-studio comedian Mike Birbiglia. A song about suicidal thoughts, deemed inappropriate by the hosts, was also played.

The segment heavily featured Freed's farewell, highlighting the perceived unfairness of his dismissal after 41 years – noting his only send-off was an omelet and steak. They calculated the time he spent commuting by bus (over two years).  The discussion touched on the cutthroat radio business, contract insecurity, and Freed's concerns about his future, including health insurance and finances. Birbiglia, Voss, and callers offered support and anecdotes. Freed’s gun hobby was mentioned, along with a recording of a Johnny Carson-esque farewell speech.  Further discussions revolved around the XM radio layoffs, sexual topics (masturbation, threesomes), and explicit anecdotes from the hosts and a call from Russell Brand.  Freed’s final goodbye message to the station concluded this segment.

The show continued with Birbiglia recounting disastrous college gigs and sharing hilariously bad reviews.  The conversation shifted to Sam Roberts' new show, "Special Delivery with Sam and Dave," and the theft of his catchphrase by Tina Fey.  The hosts discussed this and other stolen catchphrases, along with the recent firing of Kevin Straley from XM. A call from "Polish Rich," a former XM DJ, corroborated Birbiglia's St. John's University story.  A significant portion focused on Rich Voss’s nicotine gum habit. Callers shared experiences waiting for the Blackberry Storm, contrasting it with the Google phone release. One caller, Joe, a transsexual individual, described trying to win a phone for his son.  Vulgar language, sexually explicit jokes, and discussions about a convicted child molester who worked at XM and John Leguizamo in drag were prevalent.  More Blackberry Storm call-ins and banter concluded the segment.

The final excerpt started with a discussion about a rain-soaked phone promotion scavenger hunt.  “Videos of the Week” featured a drunk man on a horse and someone shaving Obama's image into their head.  George W. Bush's walk was compared to Bigfoot's.  An interview with John, a participant in the phone promotion, was interrupted by Dave, co-host of "Special Delivery," who promoted the show, using crude language.  A celebrity name game followed, with humorous incorrect guesses.  John returned, followed by speculation about employing a 12-year-old reporter. Voss discussed his Fox 5 Morning News appearance about his sleep habits. More listener calls, celebrity name guesses, and the mention of numerous XM firings occurred.  Dave’s suspension from his show due to an XM issue, not Opie’s decision, was mentioned.  The show concluded with a song dedicated to those who lost their jobs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  All right, someone tell me what happened.  What?  Just tell me what happened.  What happened? What happened? What's the haps?  What?  Jets pull off an overtime victory.  That's what I'm talking about.  Against the Pats.  That's the beauty of doing a morning radio show.  It's almost impossible to stay up past 10 o'clock. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  So you go to bed thinking one thing, and you wake up, and it's just a nice surprise.  You got a big surprise.  Big surprise on the front page of newspapers.  Yeah.  I go to bed. I watch the first half. Jets are kicking ass.  I was in touch with some of the BCN people yesterday because a trend came in for Boston, and we did very well.  Thank you, Boston.  So I want to thank everyone listening to us on WBCN.  And so I'm in contact with a couple of the boys. 
[00:01:00]  They're actually at the game.  And I even wrote in a little text, I'm like, it's really hard for me when two of my favorite teams are playing each other.  Yeah.  It's almost a win-win situation.  And I didn't think much of the Jets with this Brett Favre, but I got to jump on the bandwagon.  Something's going on here in New York.  Are you now a Favre-o-maniac?  So I watched the second half.  I mean the first half, excuse me.  Jets are kicking ass, and I'm like, all right, this game's over.  I assume everyone will just be clearing out of the stadium early, and they'll all get a good night's sleep. 
[00:01:30]  I wake up, and I always check sports scores right away because I got some action on the Islanders and a little action here.  Are you gambling?  No, not really.  I never could figure out the sports gambling.  I got a dollar bet on each game.  I dabbled a bit, but no, not really.  And all of a sudden it says Jets won in overtime.  I'm like, what?  Jets had that game. 
[00:02:00]  So I imagine the Pats had a fine second half that I didn't get to see.  Yeah.  And then a little field goal in overtime, and the Jets beat the Pats, right?  Yeah, they tied it on the last play in the fourth quarter.  Matt Castle threw a touchdown pass.  It was contested, but yet called a touchdown.  Yeah, I saw the replay this morning just to be on top of things.  That was an amazing last-second play.  And they had no timeouts with the drive, and they went like 65 yards in a minute.  And four seconds.  It was a pretty smooth drive.  I just do not dig that sudden death overtime thing with football. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, it's just amazing.  Once you win the coin toss, though, it's like, all right, get us in field goal range.  It really isn't fair that it comes down to a coin toss.  To a coin toss, for the most part.  Right.  I mean, I'd love to know the stat.  You know, call up Mad Dog.  I'm sure he knows every single, you know, I'm sure he knows every stat.  But it's like, how many times has the team that won the coin toss won the game on the first drive? 
[00:03:00]  That would be 72% there.  I believe that.  I think it's got to be a little more than that there.  Okay.  Those sports guys know all that crap.  Yeah.  You know, the other thing, so, you know when you watch a show or a sporting event, then you fall asleep?  Next thing you know, you're dreaming, like the movie continues in your wacky head or the sporting event.  I do believe the Pats won the game in my dream.  In your dream?  And they were playing on some crappy, like, high school football field that was muddy. 
[00:03:30]  On mini bikes or something stupid like that.  Like something that doesn't make sense.  But it makes sense while you're dreaming it.  Yeah, but you watch it, you go, go, go, and they're on mini bikes.  And it doesn't, it doesn't, not for a second, you go, why are they on mini bikes?  Yeah.  And I believe somebody that I was really good friends with in high school now plays with the Pats in my dream.  And I do believe he kicked a 67-yard field goal to win it all.  67-yard field goal.  So I woke up all confused, like, wow, was that real?  What, you had to question it? 
[00:04:00]  Well, when you first wake up, you have to question everything.  Yeah, it's true.  And then I find out that the game was a lot closer than when I left it.  I just, I just questioned my ambition at that hour.  It's like, am I going to call in and say I can't make it?  Oh, every morning.  Every morning.  Every morning.  I get the old, it's too early.  I just want to stay asleep.  And I got it all figured out in my head.  I know, like, if you let two or three weeks go by, you're calling sick, no one's going to question it.  Yeah.  So I'm getting close to that point.  But I'm like, every morning. 
[00:04:30]  Well, yeah, I know.  Every morning.  And it's, believe me, it's a great job.  I love coming here and doing a show.  It's just from the point of waking up till my ass is out of bed.  Right.  Once I'm out of bed, I, you know, you're motivated.  Get dressed, get yourself out the door and come in and have fun.  But, boy, it's that getting, pushing the covers off you, sitting on the edge of the bed with, like, your sack all, like, squished because you're leaning off on the bed. 
[00:05:00]  And it's just, it's just an awful thing.  You're just like, ugh.  Now it's cold.  Yeah.  It's just the worst feeling ever.  Put your underwear on.  Have some dignity.  Right.  You got flu bag every morning.  Oh, every morning.  You're overheated in your sheets and blankets.  So the Jets beat the Pats in overtime.  Wow.  Jets are in first place?  That's crazy.  It's the sole, yeah, sole heir to first place right now. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I'm looking for the Jets to go all the way.  Wait.  Travis has got the, um.  Travis has the stat?  Wait, I can't really figure out what you're trying to tell me here.  Why don't you say it?  That he's gay.  No, no, no, no.  No.  I'm not a wife.  Oh.  Beard?  Beard?  No.  No.  Maybe.  What?  There have been 365 overtime games.  Okay.  Okay.  From 1974 to 2003.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Of all of those.  There's more.  Of all of those.  52% of the coin toss winners have won the game.  That's it?  So it's a toss-up.  It's a coin toss for the coin toss.  What the hell is that?  It pretty much is a toss-up.  A very small.  A slight advantage to the.  Advantage, but.  Yeah.  Boy, I would have put it so much higher than that.  They should have some kind of, um.  Kind of crappy teams win the coin toss that they can't drive up into field goal range.  They should do some kind of, like, shootout like hockey does.  Well, college does that, I think. 
[00:06:30]  What?  They do a shootout?  Well, each team gets the ball on, like, the 40-yard line, and you trade off until, uh.  There should be.  Someone misses, yeah.  There should just be another quarter.  I kind of agree with you.  Just have a time.  If someone scores, they score.  And then what happens if they're tied at the end of that?  Then, uh.  They, you know.  But the guys.  With guns.  The guys take a beating, though.  They take a beating with the football.  You know, you're right there, Ropey.  I didn't even think of that.  You're kind of right, though.  You're kind of right.  They should probably play, like, half a quarter or something.  I want to say the football doubleheader. 
[00:07:00]  You know.  Oh, my God.  A twine-out doubleheader as they're, you know, just beaten to a pulp at the end of it.  I think I'm on to something, though.  I want a shootout in football.  Let's say the Pats and the Jets, they're tied after, you know, regulation or whatever.  And then you make them put on the hockey gear.  Yeah.  That's the type of shootout I'm really talking about.  That's a good one.  Next thing you know, you have Brett Favre going up ice trying to, like, score a goal.  All stastic.  Right.  Trying to shoot a goal. 
[00:07:30]  Just completely changed the sport for overtime.  I had a golf outing once with, you know, Buddy.  Sure.  Buddy.  Buddy's all right.  Yeah.  He's living on Long Island now.  But when he was out in Colorado, and we decided it was going to be a great idea.  Let's have a great day.  We'll start early.  We'll go to the golf course.  Dude, 36 holes.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  By the 18th hole.  You're miserable.  You're kind of like, all right, let's finish this up.  And then knowing that you have another 18 to go around. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  That's a drag.  Oh, it was like, we're not pros here.  No, it's really a drag.  You're just swinging.  You're hacking everything because your arms are tired.  Your legs.  Yeah.  You're drunk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a good idea.  So, I guess the Jets are for real.  I mean, the Pat.  I mean, whatever.  Just an amazing division.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Matt.  Hey, listen.  I know why you guys fell asleep early. 
[00:08:30]  That commentating for that game sucked, man.  It reminded me of the 80s or something.  Hey, listen.  I took my girlfriend for a two-year anniversary at FH Raleigh, man.  The place was great, bro.  Yeah, my brother does a great job with the joint, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of  Huntington Village.  Were you watching the game on NFL Network, though, Matt?  No, I watched it on the CWWB, whatever it is, the base.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was going to, I don't know.  I just couldn't keep it on.  I had to keep flipping back and forth. 
[00:09:00]  Those guys just sucked, man.  There was no atmosphere.  Thursday night ball.  You know, you don't get those games too much.  I just thought there was going to be a little more excitement.  Plus, you know, the way it finished, just those guys are ducks.  If you can't make that game exciting, maybe you shouldn't be in broadcasting, you know?  That was a big deal.  But maybe they were falling asleep because the first half was a blowout.  They're like, ah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, punch it out, guys.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  What else is going on today?  I see we got the steak joint here. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, I love that.  I like how Jimmy says it, but Jimmy's not here today.  Ruth's.  Ruth's.  Chris's.  Steakhouse.  Ruth's.  For a second.  In Weehawken, New Jersey, supplying the omelets.  Because it's another sad day.  How many sad days?  It's.  How can we explain this to the average Joe out there?  Well.  Radio is completely falling apart.  Watch a Vietnam movie.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the closest I can get to this.  Yeah.  You have a buddy who poked his head up over the ridge a little too soon. 
[00:10:00]  That's what it's like around here these days.  Well, they're saying goodbye to Steve.  Not Steve.  Steve Freed.  Not Steve.  Steven Carr.  Lead singer of Foundry.  He's best known as playing Wood Yee for Howard Show.  Yes.  You might remember him as Wood Yee on Howard's show when Howard was here.  Well, he's been with the company 41 years.  41 years.  He started when he was 22. 
[00:10:30]  He's being shown the door just short of retirement age.  That's wonderful.  Can't tell you how many jobs I've had.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah.  How many jobs I've had since I was 22?  And this guy had a job.  Yeah.  22.  Kept it until two years short?  Pretty much.  Oh, God.  He built up sick leave.  He had like seven months, he told us.  Seven months of sick time because he didn't take sick time.  So it's built up.  And then one little thing they have here at CBS, I guess, is, oopsie, if we let you go, 
[00:11:00]  there goes your sick time.  So I think he might have lost his seven months sick time.  Seven months sick time.  The guy has come in here year after year after year with the flu just so he could build up  some sick time.  This is just a lot of this just corporate.  And I don't want to sound like, man, the corporations, man.  But it's just this corporate insensitivity.  And I'm not talking about, you know, some slouch who's been here for two months that 
[00:11:30]  goes to human resources and says, I was, you know, discriminated or somebody said, you  know, I looked nice today.  Right.  You know, stuff like that.  There's a guy that really, a soldier, put in his time, you know, and just got stuck in  the keister at the end of it.  It's just, it makes it harder and harder to do this job because you're just seeing people  just left and right getting, you know, fired, let go. 
[00:12:00]  Just waiting to catch that one.  You know, you never hear the bullet that gets you.  Right.  Oh, I fully expect it.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  I'm not stupid.  One day we just won't be here.  That's just how it works in this business.  We've said that all the time.  And it's happened every time.  Yeah.  So, you know, it might be Monday.  Who knows?  You never know.  No, we might, maybe because we're talking about the fact they're letting a guy go after  41 years could be the reason they fire us.  That could be like line one on our contract.  Right. 
[00:12:30]  Never talk about people that are let go.  Just a solid dude.  And I don't know.  He's, he's really, really upset because he kind of, he kind of like thought something  was up and sure enough, yeah, something was up and they're, they're letting Steve Freed  go today.  Yeah.  And so we, we invited the steak joint in today to make some omelets.  It's the very least this company could do, but the company did not do this.  The Opie and Anthony show did this.  And then yesterday, uh, my BlackBerry was going off like crazy because we also do a satellite 
[00:13:00]  radio show and, uh, the takeover is official.  Sirius took over XM.  It wasn't a merger.  Merger.  What?  Yesterday I was out and about and this BlackBerry almost, almost exploded with the goodbye emails  coming in.  With the firings that were going on.  Just tomorrow's my last day.  Want to thank blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then you read that and you kind of get a little sad and then it goes off again.  Tomorrow's my last day too.  What are people sending me?  Multiple, uh, emails? 
[00:13:30]  No.  I'm getting duplicate email.  Wait a minute.  Different name.  No, at least 20, at least 20 yesterday.  At least.  I guess today's a big day for XM where a lot of people are gone after today.  They changed their, uh, programming schedule around, uh, programming.  So, uh, I guess that's time to let people go.  There's some, uh, redundancy in the system.  The radio business is getting downright scary.  They, they, they, they fired like receptionists in our company.  Yeah.  There's no one there at the front door.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  You can sit there just going knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.  No.  Hello.  It's like, I am legend in the hallways.  Yeah.  When they fired Tom Chiasano, well, wink, wink.  He says it wasn't a firing.  I think there was a, it was a firing.  There was some kind of an agreement there.  Pay off.  You know, makes it look cooler.  Like he decided after all those years, he wanted to go explore new opportunities.  Yeah.  Okay.  Watch.  Yeah.  I looked at Tom like, yeah, okay.  I'm going to buy into that.  Open a lemonade stand.  Right.  What are you going to do when you've been here since you were 10?  And they didn't really replace him. 
[00:14:30]  And then they got rid of the PDs.  No PDs.  There's nobody.  It's just me and you and the steak joint making omelettes.  Yeah.  No one left.  So, so we say goodbye to Steve Free today.  Just amazing.  We got to do the right thing because we're pretty much the last, last men standing here.  You know what you do?  You just get in the foxhole, pull the dead bodies on top of you.  Yeah.  And hope the enemy just goes on by thinking you're dead. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  They left me all alone.  I hope they at least leave us a helicopter so we can get the hell out of here.  Evac at some point.  Yeah.  How are we going to get out of here if we're the last one?  So many friends.  I've seen their heads explode right next to me.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So for Steve, we'll, I don't know, we'll play a little something here.  He actually recorded a goodbye.  Did he?  Yeah, that E-Rock says is kind of sad.  Aw.  Really sad.  Is it to music or just him talking and saying goodbye? 
[00:15:30]  He decides to say goodbye to a lot of people.  Where is it?  Did they take it away from me?  We can play it after the break.  We've got a couple of them.  Yeah, I know.  I got this.  Goodbye, Marconi.  And then one of our homeless guys died.  Yeah.  So we got to, I will remember you.  Who is it?  We'll tell you after the break.  Of course we will.  E-Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  So what's up with the Steve Free thing?  It's kind of sad.  You want to kill yourself after hearing this.  Really?  Oh, my God.  There's two tracks.  You have to play them in order.  Right.  And I think we just may leave early today. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, Joe.  Why?  It's sad.  It's really sad.  And seeing him crying while he was recording it.  Oh, no.  What?  Is there video?  41 years.  Listen to Stump Brain.  Stump Brain goes, is there video?  Right.  We could use that on onaradio.com.  Are you kidding?  Save this for later, but you have to play it in that order.  Oh, my God.  Dude, 41 years.  He recorded a goodbye speech?  Well, there's a song he does first, and then there's the goodbye speech. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Opie wasn't even going to be born for another two years when he got his job here.  Well, yeah.  God.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  So, can I ask a real question?  And I know I get in a lot of trouble with corporate because they don't like that I speak  my mind.  Is the company doing anything for this guy?  Are they at least getting him a dumb watch?  A gold watch, and then they'll throw all his stuff out in the dumpster out back.  And why is it that we had to get the breakfast people today? 
[00:17:00]  They got him a room in a halfway house.  Oh, my God.  I hate these weird...  It ain't gone itself in a big damn hurry.  I don't think I'm going to stay.  I don't think anyone will miss an old engineer.  He'll scrape his name.  Steve was here on a beam.  And then you'll just see his little shoes pushing that table over. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  We're going to have to get him on the air today.  I could kill the general manager, sort of like a bonus.  Like a bonus.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes my hands hurt.  Sometimes I think I'll see Tom Chiesano in the hallway, but he never comes.  Oh, my God.  This is just the worst.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:18:00]  I hate these feelings I'm getting lately.  This is terrible.  You know, emotions.  Oh, those things.  This is what people feel on a regular basis, this emotion.  What is this?  It took this crap to drag some emotions out of me.  One quick thing.  You were talking about all those emails we were getting on the satellite side.  Yeah.  You know, not our facility, but the other facility that's two blocks away.  Here in New York, sure.  As of today, the operations manager was over yesterday.  It's completely empty. 
[00:18:30]  They were asking us if we wanted chairs and file cabinets and stuff.  Oh, my God.  They're just...  Wow.  This radio business is, I'm not even joking, just ruining lives.  It's just...  It's like a plague.  Right.  Like, people are dropping dead, and the people left are like, did I catch it?  Oh, my God.  Is this an airborne firing, or is it bloodborne?  Oh, these goodbye emails are so depressing.  And I'm reading every single one.  I don't know why.  I feel like I have to for some reason. 
[00:19:00]  The operations manager asked if he could move out of that facility, and they told him no.  So, he's the only one in a far office by himself, and then there's empty studios that are not being used.  That's where he goes to work every day now.  It's just cruel.  Wow.  It's cruel to put someone in that circumstance.  It's like Milton from The Office.  Yeah, yeah.  Put him in the basement.  Put him in the basement.  Oh, no.  I'm going to burn the plates down.  We'll see what this all becomes eventually, but hard times for radio, and radio people. 
[00:19:30]  Well, the economy is in the crapper, and they're making these cuts, but I don't know.  Who decides how these cuts are done?  Because it's so cruel.  The company we work for here in New York, they hired someone called the Grim Reaper.  Their whole job is just to go from station to station to fire people.  And I heard that the Grim Reaper was back at a certain station for a second time, and 
[00:20:00]  everyone knew what that meant.  That's got to be fair.  That a few people were getting the axe.  Not going to work here anymore.  Oh, my God.  So, the Steve Freed goodbye is just brutal.  Can we play it after the break?  No.  If you're going to have him on the air, you have to let him on the air, but you can't  play that until after you're officially done with the movie.  You just can't.  That means I got it now.  Yeah.  No, there's a reason to it.  Oh. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I got to play it after the break, because the curiosity is going to kill me.  You can play the song, you just can't play the speech.  Why?  Because you can't.  Speech is the best part, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  Does it end with a gunshot, and we got to call the police?  Why?  Because it's very final.  For him or us?  For him.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing to me?  Oh, no.  I'm chomping at the bit here.  Steve, do you know? 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  Yeah, I do.  I've heard them both, and point to which one you're talking about.  The second one.  Talking about that one.  Oh, yeah.  The second one, yeah, you got to, that's.  That's how you end?  That's how you end.  Well, we have to wait until the end?  No.  Well, if you're going to have him on the air, talk to him, but then once he's done, then  you play that.  Oh, because of the ending?  Yes.  Oh, I understand that.  Right.  But we can play it twice.  Okay, if you want to.  I got to play it after the break.  Oh, I got it.  The guy, like, did 41 years, and this is his last day, and he only found out, like, Tuesday. 
[00:21:30]  People have done that twice.  And they called him.  Huh?  They called him.  They called him.  They called him after his vacation to tell him.  It was a phone call?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It just gets more and more evil.  It just gets worse and worse.  You can't do the right thing and sit the guy down and try to explain and maybe throw him  a little bit of a bone or give him a little something, something that he could open up.  Dude, I can even understand a new guy. 
[00:22:00]  Like, hey, you're a low man on the totem pole here.  We thought we had some extra resources.  We hired you.  Yeah, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.  After 41 years, that's like royalty.  You got to.  You got to do the right thing.  Oh, no, apparently you don't.  Well, we all understand how the corporate world works in the year 2008, but you always  hold out hope that people would do the right thing.  Wow.  Yeah.  And they call me crazy in corporate.  Yeah, okay.  There's one part of it that he can't discuss on air, but it's worse than what you already 
[00:22:30]  know.  All right, we're playing it next.  Because we can't even do a show.  I know.  I have to.  We're playing it next.  And then we'll make believe we didn't play it for the people that tune in later on in  the show.  All right.  Well, Steve Freed, very easy to explain him.  He did Wood Yee for Howard Stern for many, many years.  And he became a really good friend of Ant and I.  We see him every day and still friends with the gang over there on Howard's show.  He's always such an optimist when you see him in the hallway and say, hey, I'll see you 
[00:23:00]  tomorrow.  Well, God willing.  God willing, I'll be here on Monday.  If, you know, with a little luck.  I sure hope so.  Perhaps.  There was one time he said, just say, I'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  I say goodbye to him and he goes, we'll see what the world has in store for me over the  weekend.  Oh, God.  What the world has in store.  Oh, my God.  I hate emotions. 
[00:23:30]  Apparently, it was a giant CBS anvil plummeting towards his head.  Right.  Oh, God.  Oh.  It took, they should have, yeah, they should have taken him out in cartoon form.  Yeah.  Some horrific thing.  All right.  Well, here's a little taste of the front seat of the car and put an ice pick through the  back of his neck.  I thought he never shut up.  Poor, poor Steve.  Here's a little taste of Steve Freed after 41 years being let go today by this fine company. 
[00:24:00]  You're going to listen.  Never going to give you up.  Never going to let you down.  Never going to run around and desert you.  Never going to make you cry.  Never going to say goodbye.  Never going to tell a lie and hurt you.  How great was Lane Staley? 
[00:24:30]  Come on.  Give it up for him.  O.P. and Anthony.  I don't know.  We're in a weird position today.  It's been happening for months and months.  Yep.  People just getting fired left and right.  We haven't brought a lot of it onto the show.  But a lot of the faithful listeners, they know. 
[00:25:00]  They watch Tom Chiasano say goodbye.  Yeah.  And P.D. after P.D. after P.D. say goodbye.  Oh, my God.  The P.D.'s.  Yeah.  The business is just, it's at a crossroads.  Yeah.  Something's going to have to give.  And today we say goodbye to a guy, Steve Freed.  Yep.  He did the Wood Yee voice for Howard.  Easiest way to describe him for the people out there.  And he's been with this company, CBS Radio, for 41 years. 
[00:25:30]  41 years.  Barely took a sick day.  Yeah.  He accumulated seven months of sick days.  That's the type of employee this guy was.  He could take off for seven months.  Right.  Well, could have.  But rumor has it they might have taken away this sick day setting freaking work.  Just brutal, man. 
[00:26:00]  And here's just some of the things.  Yeah, this puts 41 years in perspective.  Yeah.  Because you might think, all right, the guy got hired 41 years ago.  He was 22 years old.  Yeah.  And you go, okay, that's 41 years.  But it puts it in a little perspective when you kind of give it a little timeline.  Yeah, exactly.  Woodstock was two years away when Steve started at CBS.  No one even knew it.  It was a little small town in upstate New York with no history, no nothing. 
[00:26:30]  No one cared about it.  Martin Luther King Jr. was still alive when Steve Freed started with his company.  The Beatles were still rocking for another three years.  They were still...  And they were only together for like six years.  Right.  They had half their career still to go when CBS hired Steve Freed.  The Berlin Wall.  Yeah.  Was what?  Just up?  Yeah, it was only up a couple years.  Oh, it was only up a couple years at that point.  Okay. 
[00:27:00]  A little band called Led Zeppelin?  Yeah.  They weren't even a band yet.  But CBS hired Steve Freed, who they're letting go today.  By the way, they told him Tuesday.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  Here's one.  We got a black president now, right?  This Obama?  Well, in January.  In January, sure.  Blacks were celebrating the first year they were allowed to vote when CBS hired Steve Freed.  I can see Steve walking the hallways.  He's going, I can't believe the *** are allowed to vote. 
[00:27:30]  It's all downhill from here, guys.  What's this world coming to?  And the number one song.  Them voting is going to go over like a Led Zeppelin.  Hey.  Hey, I'm going to call Robert and give him that one.  Number one song back in 1967 when they hired Steve Freed.  Typo.  What?  It says a winter shade of pale. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was a wider shade of pale by Procol Harum.  Yep.  It was the number one song in the country.  The U.S. population was 198 million.  Wow.  We whizzed past 300 million.  Well, since Steve has worked at CBS, the country has grown by 106 million people.  Has it doubled?  Almost.  And let's remember, people were dying that whole time, too.  So that's crazy.  That is crazy. 
[00:28:30]  I hope I don't catch the typhoid.  Yeah.  You said it.  It's like the Black Plague, and we're just hoping for the best.  Yeah.  That we somehow will survive this.  Wrap some rags around your face and hope you don't breathe it in.  I don't really hold out much hope for us.  I don't hold out much hope for this medium.  Like, everything.  I'm talking like just where people use some kind of machine to turn on other people's choices of music. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  It just seems to me like a very archaic way of doing things.  I should explain myself, though.  I think the Opie and Anthony show will go on for a while now.  But in its current...  Yeah.  What's the word I'm looking for?  Incarnation.  In its current distribution, I don't hold out hope for.  But I do believe it becomes something else.  And we'll be just fine.  I know one thing CBS has done is really embrace the internet and certain aspects of that. 
[00:29:30]  So I don't know if that's, you know, going to pull in new people in the future.  Yeah.  Is this one of those, like, purge?  And then you get new people, new young go-getters that are 22 years old.  Well, as we beat up corporate today, I mean, the fact is they're just not making enough money.  So you've got to make your cuts.  Yeah.  What is it?  The bottom line.  The bottom line.  Yep.  Got to get out of the red.  So, I mean, if the internet starts, you know, making money for this company, then you get to see people being hired again. 
[00:30:00]  Apparently, Kevin from Connecticut is saying Steve was hired during the Summer of Love.  1967.  There you go.  I'm going to go f*** some whores.  Oh, I could say whores.  Some whores.  Where's he going?  Going to Frisco.  He rock.  To go bang some broads.  Yeah.  So, he rock.  Even though you're telling us we should wait, I've got to play the Steve Frieden goodbye speech. 
[00:30:30]  Love the one you're with.  You should play the song first.  Play the song first.  And then play the speech.  And what were you just telling me during the break?  I was trying to remember some other stuff about Steve.  And earlier this year, I remember Steve coming in all upset and asking what was wrong.  And he was complaining that they had raised the price of his bus fare.  Because it takes him about an hour on the bus to get here in the morning.  Oh, he spends an hour on the bus every day for 41 years.  He's been taking a bus into New York for 41 years? 
[00:31:00]  That I don't know.  But it seems like it, yeah.  Ralph Cramden was his bus driver.  Right.  Well, the Doors self-titled debut album was released when...  Debut album.  When CBS hired Steve Frieden.  And what was the other thing?  He's looking for a job, but...  Well, when he was telling me about the news, I said, so what are you doing?  And he said he's been looking online for job opportunities and other options for his medical coverage.  And then he pauses and he goes, but it just takes so long because all I have is dial-up. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  You're kidding me.  No, I'm not.  Dial-up.  On an old rotary phone.  He's got like that connection like in war games.  Yeah.  Where you got to put the handset in the cradle.  Welcome.  You're fired.  Right.  You have unemployment. 
[00:32:00]  And he's been scared S-less for the last six months.  Every day, he's like, I don't know if I'm going to make it to the end of the year.  I'm hoping.  Whatever life brings.  Right.  Average household income when Steve Fried was hired by CBS.  $7,143.  What was the Dow at?  The Dow?  That's a good one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  What was the Dow at when he was hired?  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I bet it was.  And by the way, the obvious one. 
[00:32:30]  Probably close to what it is now.  Yeah, right.  And the obvious one, we weren't on the moon yet for another two years when CBS hired.  It was.  Steve Fried.  Apollo 4 had just taken off.  Yes.  The week before.  It was November 4th of that year.  But Apollo 4, we weren't even in double digits.  Yeah, we wouldn't go to the moon until Apollo 11.  What did Apollo 4 end up doing?  It circled and came back.  It just went round and round a few times?  Great.  But wait, I just did the math.  If he spends an hour each way on the bus and he did it for 41 years, it's over 10 years 
[00:33:00]  of work he could have accumulated.  21,000 hours.  There's 2,000 hours of work in a year.  He spent 10 years on a bus?  Yeah.  Well, 10 work years on a bus.  10 work years on a bus.  To give his blood and sweat for this company.  They got him something, right?  Uh, no.  For an old just adios, you're fired.  Right.  We got him breakfast.  I know.  Yeah.  We did, by the way.  Not the company. 
[00:33:30]  We got together.  And I know we're supposed to, you know, be looked at as complete a-holes.  But we got together and said, you know what?  Somebody has to do something for this guy.  Give him a gold watch.  Uh, wow.  We're living about Schmidt today.  Yep.  Yeah, that's it.  A movie that I think is hilarious.  But now that it's like, it's kind of real today, it's not so funny anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's Steve Freed singing a little song for everybody today.  Oh, no.  And then we got the goodbye speech that E-Rock says is brutal and we should maybe just go 
[00:34:00]  home afterwards.  All right.  Here's Steve Freed after 41 years.  He recorded this, what, this morning?  Yesterday.  Goodbye, cruel world.  I'm leaving you today.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
[00:34:30]  Goodbye, all you people.  There's nothing you can say to make me change my mind.  Goodbye.  That's how it ends, by the way.  Are you kidding me?  It just gets cut off like that?  Yeah.  That's symbolic. 
[00:35:00]  I guess the company said, good enough, don't want to waste any more tape.  Any more recording time.  Right.  Wow.  I did quotes with my tape because I know it's all digital now.  Goodbye.  That's, that's awful.  That is really depressing.  All right.  And then, and then what?  And now here's the goodbye speech?  Yeah, because he didn't know if he'd have a chance to say goodbye to people in this company  that he liked.  So we were giving him the opportunity to do so.  What is he doing right now?  I don't know.  I'll go find out.  He should be watched the entire morning.  He's packing. 
[00:35:30]  Is he packing his little box up?  I'll go find out.  Everyone gets to take down the elevator.  Wait, wait, E-Rock.  With a name plate.  Yeah.  Then we'll find out what he's doing and we got to get him live on the air.  But Steve Freed, after 41 years, I know a lot of the people we talked to out there don't  really know him, but, you know, here's his goodbye speech to people he loved and knew  from this company.  Yeah.  All right.  Steve Freed, I've worked as an engineer for this station for 41 years. 
[00:36:00]  Today, sadly, is my final day with the company.  It's not the job that I'll miss.  It's the amazing people I've had the privilege to work with that have become family to me.  People like Paco, Roscoe, Zachary, Jay Thomas, Dan Ingram, Dave Herman, Pete Fornatel, The  Howard Stern Show, Billy West, Artie Lang, Opie and Anthony, and Jimmy Norton. 
[00:36:30]  And not just the people on the air.  There are countless people behind the scenes and in the office that meant the world to  me.  In this industry, it is uncommon to be given the chance to publicly say goodbye.  Opie and Anthony have been gracious enough to give me this opportunity to do so.  Thank you to the staff, the shows, the talent, the listeners, for the best 41 years of my  life. 
[00:37:00]  Goodbye, farewell, and your mom's box.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I just got something in my eye, all right?  Give me that.  I was wondering why you turned away from the mic there for a second.  No, I just got a little something in my eye.  Yeah?  A little dust came up from the board. 
[00:37:30]  Stupid emotions!  Have them cut out.  I hate emotions.  Love that.  Just go in.  They could take them out with lasers now, those emotions.  Wow.  What the hell, dude?  What the...  Will you go crack this bottle of wine and start drinking at this hour?  No kidding.  I'm going to go get them.  Well, we'll talk to them after the break.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I'm...  Yeah, Steve from Bayshore.  Right now, I consider myself, self, self, the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  Could we maybe try to, like, bring some funny into this situation?  Maybe he could, like, record famous farewell speeches all morning long?  Okay.  What other ones?  What are some of those other farewell speeches?  Get Nixon's, sir.  Nixon's?  Mr. Nixon's?  Yeah.  You won't have me to kick around anymore.  You... 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Let's get him to do a few, because he...  Won't have Steve Freed to kick around anymore.  Right.  Yeah, why don't we have him do that?  Because we've got to keep him distracted.  Okay.  I shall not seek, nor shall I accept.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's do that.  This job.  I will not run.  It's nominated.  More stuff that, uh...  What's going on?  Anyone have a tissue?  Jesus.  What the hell?  What is this foreign crap coming out of my eyes? 
[00:39:00]  Uh, the Dow Jones, uh, Anthony, back in 1967, was at, uh, 879.  879.  When they hired Steve Freed.  Right.  Thanks for the tissues.  The Andy Griffith Show was the number one show on TV, and in 1967, the ABA was formed.  Oh.  A little perspective on, uh, how long he's been an employee here. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  All right.  We'll, uh, we'll go to break with a little fun here.  Steve Freed did a lot of, like, uh, songs for us.  Sure.  He had, uh, such a unique voice.  We, uh, you know, we try to make, make him do some fun stuff for, uh, the Opie and Anthony  show.  Here's his Led Zeppelin montage as we go to break.  Opie and Anthony.  We've done four already, but now we're steady, and then we went.  One, two, three, four.  Good times, bad times, you know I had my share.  When my woman left home, you know, I don't seem to care. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, hey, mama. 
[00:40:30]  I said, the way you move, gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.  Oh, oh, child, it'll make you think, gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.  Hey.  This is a very special Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:41:00]  Yes, yes.  As we say goodbye to Steve Freed.  All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces, bright and early for  their daily...  Stevie Darko.  Yeah.  If you listen closely, this is how I imagine Steve Freed sounded 41 years ago. 
[00:41:30]  Kind of sounds like...  Right?  Yeah, a little bit.  ...filling up their glasses.  No expression.  Before time got the best of them.  No expression.  Hide my head.  I wanna drown my sorrow.  No tomorrow.  No tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich doesn't know what's going on.  I kind of go so depressing.  What do you think?  Well, it's a weird... 
[00:42:00]  To step out of, like, my role as a-hole.  Good luck with that.  Right, right.  How do you say role or personality?  Well, you know, whatever you wanna make of it.  But it's just a weird time to be a radio host.  Because, you know, Ant and I come in here every day and we try to ignore what's going on,  which means...  Which is everyone around us is getting fired.  Being leveled.  Everywhere we turn, people are getting fired. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  And, like, commercial radio is in a weird crossroads.  Satellite radio, those two companies merged and we lost as far as that merger goes.  So, they're firing pretty much everyone that had something to do with XM.  Yeah, everyone we knew.  Right.  And then, this Steve Freed, who we've seen for the last almost three years, two and a half years,  they're letting him go after 41 years with the company.  41 years.  Wow.  And I think it finally came to our head today that we gotta, we kinda gotta acknowledge what 
[00:43:00]  the hell's going on out there.  Yeah, free state today.  And kind of acknowledge that a lot of really talented people are being shown the door because,  you know, the business is in a weird state right now.  Steve from Bayshore saying, as if the day wasn't depressing enough, Voss is in studio.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, boy.  Yes, Steve.  Out with the old, in with the old.  Is that, is that Steve, is he the guy like the...  The mad scientist.  That walks, it's kinda sad because...  It's really sad. 
[00:43:30]  You know...  Because where, where does he go from here?  He's 63, all he knows is radio.  He told me two days ago, he goes, I, I don't know what it's like to be fired, I've never  been fired before.  He's like, I've never been fired.  He started with the company when he was 22, right out of college, you know...  Young buck.  Young buck filled with, you know what?  Yeah.  Blank and vinegar.  And, you know, then time gets the best of you and you're showing the door and now what?  Had the world by the balls, right?  Now what?  And then...  And then... 
[00:44:00]  You couldn't...  41 years later.  Yeah.  A moon landing.  And then, I was telling you, well, everybody, with this XM thing, people are sending in  their goodbye emails like crazy.  I hate, I hate the new technology, I decided.  Because, you know, a mere few years ago, you didn't have the opportunity to send out these  mass goodbye emails.  People just left.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  When A-Rock runs in, that means he's got an update. 
[00:44:30]  That's not good.  It's not about Steve.  It's about those.  They're not sending their own mass goodbyes.  They have to submit them to HR.  No!  And the HR lady is the one who's submitting them to the rest of the company.  See, so that can't even be a personal, you know...  What?  They don't trust these people with their goodbye emails?  What are they going to do?  Give away the secrets of radio?  It's like when they sent letters from the army in World War II.  Right.  They're just black censored lines over things.  We're in...  Blank, blank.  Blank, blank, blank. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Our mission is blank, blank, blank.  So this is what it's come down to.  You can't even send out your own goodbye email.  It has to go through, like, a human resource department.  They've got to approve your goodbye email.  A lot of people that are fired would probably want...  There it is.  Would probably want to maybe say some disparaging remarks about the company.  Well, let them!  Well, no.  No.  No, because you're not allowed.  It's got to go through H.R. Puff and stuff for some reason.  Hey, here's things that didn't exist when Steve Freed was hired by CBS Radio. 
[00:45:30]  Didn't exist.  Yeah.  Puts a little perspective on it.  The World Trade Center.  Wow.  Doesn't exist again, but what we're talking about here is they didn't even begin building  the damn thing.  Right.  Monday Night Football did not exist.  The New York City Marathon did not exist.  The floppy disk did not exist.  That came and went since you've been here.  Things that have come and gone.  You could pretty much do.  Disney World wasn't around yet.  Disney World?  There's just a little Disneyland.  And that was new. 
[00:46:00]  Amtrak.  The Nasdaq.  Pong.  Meaning the first video game, basically.  Federal Express wasn't around.  Well...  The Heimlich maneuver.  We didn't even know how to save people that were choking at them.  Oh my goodness.  Someone's choking.  I have no clue what to do.  Betamax and VHS.  And guess what?  Gambling in Atlantic City did not exist when this company hired Steve Freed.  President since he's been hired.  Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush. 
[00:46:30]  You forgot a president-elect.  And of course Barry is.  I never thought I'd see the day where I'd have to be fired and a s*** in the White House.  Yeah.  Do they give him a party or something?  Party.  This is it.  You're looking at it, Rich.  Party 41 years.  You see this?  That's...  Yeah.  That was from us.  And that's all...  He doesn't get a watch.  He doesn't get a fishing trip.  I honestly don't know, but I would bet a lot of money that he's just walking out of here 
[00:47:00]  after 41 years.  What's he getting like a letter?  Bad news and worse news or something?  I don't know.  Stunty.  Yeah.  Give me the MSRP of a 67 vet.  Ah.  Let's see what the hell a Corvette, brand new, 1967 Corvette, would have cost you.  Sure.  Had you walked into that dealership.  Yeah, but the difference is you could still use a vet 40 years.  How much?  $16,999. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  Righteous bucks.  Nice.  I'll take two.  Yeah, well.  So the goodbye emails I was talking about.  Another one just came in five minutes ago.  And I guess I had to go through human resources because you're not allowed to send your own  goodbye email.  No.  So it's filtered.  And then they go, all right, we'll send this out to everybody.  It's a guy, Scott Walterman.  He's a news guy, and he sent news updates all the time for all XM employees, and I read 
[00:48:00]  them constantly just to try to be up on what's going on, right?  He writes, wow.  I know it sounds trite to say that working at XM was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,  but truly it was.  And more sadness, right?  We all start like that.  It's been a great experience.  I've been blessed.  Over my 30...  Oh, no.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm mad because I can't get in one club in Missouri.  Over my 30-plus years in radio and TV, I've been so very lucky to work at some of the greatest 
[00:48:30]  nameplates in broadcasting.  I'm just a kid from Miami who got to work in some of the greatest shops in our business.  Shops?  But the histories of those places were already built by the time I got there.  Now I know what it must have been like to be there when those shops were built.  XM became another media icon, and we were...  It's Edward R. Murrow's, the Bob Hopes, and the Ernie Kovacs.  When I first came to XM for my interview, blah, blah, blah, it just goes on and on and 
[00:49:00]  on and on and on and on.  There was a little mistake.  I thought that was a little high.  67 Vet was $4,240.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That's a little better.  A little high.  $4,240.  Look at you, you shyster.  That's Steve Severus paying 400% off.  Yeah, let's say hi to Morgan.  Morgan, how are you?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  I'm just calling because I'm actually out of New York, and I'm an HR manager, and it's 
[00:49:30]  pretty bad out here.  Yeah.  It's easy.  No, I know.  That's why we're kind of acknowledging this today.  I mean, it's been happening in radio way before the stock market crashed, by the way.  Now, everyone is feeling this.  Everyone is seeing people get fired if they're not getting fired themselves.  Yeah, that's a scary thing.  Myself, I'm like, okay, are we next?  Yeah.  You know, you give it your all for your job, and one day they just go, ah, we don't need  you anymore.  Yeah.  And I guess there's no easy way to let people go. 
[00:50:00]  I understand that.  But I guess the point we're making today, you know, 41 years, you got to do something.  You got to do a little something, something.  Yeah.  Whatever that is.  I don't know.  So, all right, Morgan.  Thank you.  But during a recession, isn't, like, people that work in TV, I know, say they're not getting  bonuses this year.  But during this time, isn't TV and radio making a fortune, because that's what everybody's  doing now, is watching TV and listening.  They're not going out.  Who's making a fortune in TV and radio?  I'm saying, isn't this when TV... 
[00:50:30]  The companies?  Yeah.  When they prosper, because people aren't going to the theater, or...  No.  Radio is in the...  No, that's...  You're laughing.  That's a normal...  The companies that advertise don't have the money to go to these TV stations and radio  stations and say, hey, we'll spend money on your shows.  So, the stations aren't making money.  They're putting shows out, and then they have to say, well, advertising's down, so we can't  pay the talent as much as we'd like to.  It's like a big, you know, trickle-down poverty thing. 
[00:51:00]  Sure.  But doesn't advertisement base on viewership?  Yeah, but if the advertiser goes, I don't care how many people you got watching, we don't  have the money.  You're going to have to lower your rates, or we're not going to advertise.  It's what it is.  That's how it works in these trying times.  Cars, beers, phone, home furnishings, all of our big advertisers, guess what's happening  to them?  So, they're not spending money on advertising.  People aren't going in and buying these things.  We're not spending as much.  Look at GM and Ford.  Yeah.  They're ready to buckle under.  Hey, speaking of bonuses, wow, this is going to really piss off some people today. 
[00:51:30]  As long as Mercedes is still in business.  You know the banks, you know the banks out there, a lot of them in deep trouble, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear this story?  I don't know which one.  Well, it's no secret that investment bankers are well compensated, mostly through year-end  bonuses.  But will they receive big bonuses this year in the midst of the financial crisis?  Of course not, right?  That would have to go away.  You got to cut that.  That's part of the, you know, the bloat that you got to take out of big business. 
[00:52:00]  You can't pay big bonuses to these bank people, right?  Right.  Spoke with several compensation consultants who said that even in this economy, firms are  worried if they don't pay out the bonuses, they'll lose their top talent, people they  want to keep for when the pastures turn green again.  But with profits plunging this year, lawmakers and taxpayers are concerned about where the  money for those bonuses will come from.  During bull markets, the year-end bonuses paid on Wall Street were enough to buy some 
[00:52:30]  very nice toys.  You'd think this year's massive financial crisis would mean those days are over.  But are they?  For Wall Street workers still employed, there could be a hefty bonus coming next month.  According to a Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs has set aside $6.8 billion for bonuses.  Morgan Stanley, $6.4 billion.  What is wrong with this goddamn country? 
[00:53:00]  How do they justify that?  They're paying out bonuses.  In the billions.  They just gave away somebody's house.  House?  House?  Who has a billion-dollar house, you dummy?  Wow, they gave away like...  They're giving away...  Neighborhoods.  Right.  How does that make sense?  How do they justify that?  First of all, the talent that they want to hold on to for when the pastures get greener.  Aren't that talented.  They're the ones that got us in this situation.  So what are they talking about?  Secondly, who's leaving?  Who's leaving a job voluntarily to go somewhere else if you didn't get your bonus? 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Not knowing if there's any job out there.  You're lucky enough if you're holding on to your gig.  Yeah.  You have no leverage now.  No.  It's more business as usual.  They don't want to do anything different or change something.  They've been doing this for years.  Let's keep doing it.  Meanwhile, the country is posting these losses that are record-setting.  That has never happened in the history of these companies.  Yeah.  And like I said, General Motors and Ford, they're looking... 
[00:54:00]  The government's pretty much saying, I don't know.  I don't think we're going to bail you guys out.  Uh-huh.  So what are they going to do?  Merge?  What are they going to...  Someone's got to scoop up Chrysler and try to make something of that?  They just...  What do they do?  What does a car company do when people aren't buying cars?  What do you do?  Rich Voss?  Yeah.  I think Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley should...  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman Sachs.  Sachs or whatever.  There's a couple of Sachs on that one. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  Yeah, whatever.  I say they bail out GM and the car companies...  With the bonus money.  With the bonus money.  Bonus.  The bonus money.  Yeah.  They bail them out.  I want a bonus.  Okay.  They bail them out.  Uh-huh.  And they're part stockholders in the company.  Well, why not just hire Rich Voss?  Wasn't that a good...  That's a good solution, I think, for everybody involved.  Now, the people that were getting the bonuses are getting points on the stocks from the buyout.  Right.  All right.  Well, you're...  Do you understand?  Sure. 
[00:55:00]  Absolutely.  I got no problem with that one.  You want more on this story or you want to bail?  Why?  This bonus thing.  Yeah, let's hear...  Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, isn't happy.  These are people who've lost enormous amounts of money.  How do you give a bonus to someone for having failed so badly as many of these people did?  What's got many on Main Street and Capitol Hill angry is that some of the $700 billion bailout package  could go into the pockets of Wall Streeters to pay their bonuses.  All of the money is supposed to go into new loans. 
[00:55:30]  None of it is supposed to go into compensation of any kind for the employees.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has opened an investigation into Wall Street bonuses.  He sent a letter to nine financial institutions demanding, quote,  a detailed accounting regarding expected payments to top management in the upcoming bonus season.  These are tax dollars that are going to these institutions, and I believe the taxpayers have a right  to hold the institutions accountable for what they're doing with their money. 
[00:56:00]  Unbelievable.  This $700 billion that the government coughed up for these bailouts,  if a penny of it goes to a bonus or some kind of compensation program for these people,  there should be a revolution in this country.  There should be a revolution.  There's no reason.  Every cent should go to bolstering the company, to getting the company back on its feet.  Yeah, to giving new loans. 
[00:56:30]  No one's giving out loans these days.  Banks make their money on loans.  They don't make money taking your money in with your little passbook and the ATM fees.  That's not where they make money.  They make money on loans, and they're scared and don't have the money to loan people anymore.  And they don't.  You've got to have a credit rating of $1,200 now.  I think they raised it, too.  They're not giving loans out.  There's too many people defaulted on them. 
[00:57:00]  So this money is there as an incentive to loan people money so they could then get the interest from it.  Not to give executives bonuses.  Where's the blood in the streets?  It should be running in the gutters of the streets.  We all just got fat and lazy in this country.  Do whatever you want to us.  What could we really do anyway?  We're not farmers anymore that could get together and get somebody to play the drum and the fife and start marching. 
[00:57:30]  Bloody rag around their head.  Right.  I want to be the drum guy.  Yeah, that's smart.  Yeah.  Everyone else could defend themselves, but I'll just keep drumming.  Unless you're drumming with pistols.  Right.  As I walk toward the enemy.  That's brilliant.  How the F did we ever get our freedom?  I'm going to be...  If the other side was doing it even worse.  I'm going to be fife guy.  Stupid.  They're doing it in bright red shoes.  Toodly doot, toodly doot, toodly doot, toodly doot, toodly doot. 
[00:58:00]  Some toodly doot guy is getting shot in the head.  And then another guy will pick up the toodly do thing.  Right.  Pick up a gun, moron.  Well, you've got to keep the toodling going if the toodly guy dies.  Oh, no!  The toodly doot.  Sorry.  how do you talk a guy  into playing the fife  you're the fife guy  alright  whatever you say 
[00:58:30]  I kind of wanted a gun  no fife  next  next  but I don't want to be the fife guy  oh wow  that's going to change the face of warfare 
[00:59:00]  no kidding  my dad's a soldier  I think when  they figured out how to shoot  more than one bullet per hour  that's when they said  alright look we can't do the fife thing anymore  pick up a gun  we understand now  here's the last bit of the story  bonuses being paid out  to these bank executives  the bailout package specifies  the top five executives of a company  cannot get a golden parachute  but doesn't limit compensation 
[00:59:30]  for any other employees  some like financial expert and reporter  Stephen Gandel  say bonuses are expected to be down  but not as much as they might have been  without the bailout  compensation should be down 70%  but because all this money  new money is coming in from the government  the firms are now saying they can pay more  and so they're only going to cut bonuses by 40%  even without bonuses  the mean annual salary  for a securities industry employee  was just under $400,000  ten times more than the average U.S. employee 
[01:00:00]  you have people losing their houses  people are on the street  they can't feed themselves  while these people are just banking on it  there you go  that should make people happy out there  as they lose their jobs  it astounds me  that there's not a revolution  what can people do  it's ridiculous  what can you do  revolt  how  go out in the street  hey what are you doing today  I'm revolting  say I'm revolting  how do you revolt 
[01:00:30]  Rich  just go out and say  I'm revolting  and people go  yeah we know  why don't we just all gather  in Times Square today  really  yeah that'll work  I know  people just  we'll fight our way  from the epicenter  outwards  it is amazing  to the rest of America  it's amazing what people  in this country will take  yeah  it's just  the people in charge  the muckety mucks  everyone in Washington  has to secretly be  just laughing their asses off  for the American people  going  what did 
[01:01:00]  how much will these idiots take  yeah  they have bent us over  time and time again  and now  this 700 billion dollar bailout  where they're all grabbing things up  American Express  all of a sudden  turned into a bank  American Express  a credit card company  pretty much  has  told the government  we're a bank now  so can we get part of that  and the government said  okay  nice  how about I'm a bank  I have a corporation 
[01:01:30]  I'm saying I'm a bank now  do anyone need a loan  you rock  you need a loan  yeah  I'll loan you money  under whatever interest  things banks give  and stuff  and then I want a loan  from the government  I want a  not a loan  I want a god damn grant  I want free money  from the government  to bolster my company  nice  because I'm hurting  in these hard economic times  nice  I'm a bank now  I like that  there you go  the bank of Kumia  disgusting  the bank of Kumia  you rock  we got an update  on Steve Free  he's recording

[01:07:30]  yeah  he was 22  when he started  and now  he's just being  shown the door  yeah  are you being serious  there's redundancies  in your  redundancies  I wish  well  I guess  as far as  the satellite radio  world goes  there's redundancies  but  but this is the  you know  FM radio side  yeah  and they're just  letting people go  because  you know  they're not making  as much money  as they used to  that's a nice way  of putting it  letting them go  like they were  prisoners  and they couldn't  wait to leave  I love that  we're letting you go  oh thank you 
[01:08:00]  will you still pay me  no  no  we're letting you go  without any more payments  oh cheers  nobody gets today  a delicious  omelette  yeah  we brought in  some people  to cook  omelettes  for everybody  this morning  so  he can have an omelette  no gold watch  no nothing  by the way Ricky  I'm already salivating  because of that  I can't believe  McDonald's are giving away  two triple cheeseburgers  for three dollars  by the way 
[01:08:30]  I love  you can tell  what demographic  you've got  it was an advert  for too much food  for very little money  yeah  whiskey  and you can get  your tires changed  yeah  exactly  many men  listen to this show  don't they  of course  we brought the  omelette people in  we did  not the company  we felt like  we had to do  something for this guy  after 41 years  and we just had  a list of things  that happened  since he got hired  in 1967  never took a sick day  he was collecting  his sick days  so he could maybe 
[01:09:00]  retire early  and get to  this isn't true  this isn't true  I tell you all this  because I think  you can appreciate this  because I was a huge fan  of the British office  obviously  he collected  seven months  of sick time  that means  he came in here  with the flu  and bad colds  and who knows  he put it  seven months  of sick time  saved up  right  or he worked  on Yom Kippur  I'd burn through  those things  the second  I would get one  it's too bad  you're not 
[01:09:30]  still doing the office  because this is  a perfect storyline  seven months  of sick time  which by the way  I hear rumors  that the company  said well  oh well  sucks that you did that  but we're not  paying your  seven months  of sick days  supposedly  he rode a bus  Ricky  for the last  41 years  and bitched  when the price  of the bus  fare went up  oh this is  really sad  yes it's  it's truly  a tragic  tragic story  although  like all tragedy  it's got a funny side  I remember  a while ago 
[01:10:00]  someone telling me  this story  they were going  isn't this the saddest  story ever  and it is  and they said  a woman  whose  kid  went missing  she just  waited for him  to come home  right  and she never  had a bath  for like 10 years  in case she missed  him at the door  and you think  that's really sad  but I just thought  well she probably  smells then  yeah really bad  take a shower  will ya  yeah  have a shower  installed  by the window  you can just  you can have a shower  and look out 
[01:10:30]  I think after so much  time he'd probably  wait at the door  for her to come  out of the shower  exactly  he's not in  I'm never coming  back again  yeah one knock  you wait another  10 years  knocks on the door  rings the bell  and no one  no one  comes to the door  so he just  goes into hiding  again  hey you know  that movie  about Schmidt  Ricky  yeah I haven't  seen it though  oh too bad  it is a really  funny movie  I'm not really  sure if it was  supposed to be  a comedy  but when I saw 
[01:11:00]  it in theaters  I laughed so  hard that old  ladies yelled  at me for laughing  because it's  very tragic  it's Jack  Nicholson  Ricky gets  forced out  after so many  years with a  company  and they just  the way they  force him out  and all of  his files  everything that  he worked on  for all the  years he was  there  he went out  back  well just to  stop you for  a second  he left all  the files for  the new guy  the new young  stud that was  taking over  his position  and the new  young stud  is like  yeah yeah  yeah yeah  and Jack  was trying to  do the right 
[01:11:30]  thing and leave  him all his  files to make  his job a little  better  like a transition  and as he's  going out back  he sees all  those files that  he gave him  in the dumpster  it's like  here's your  life your  entire life  all your  wisdom and  knowledge that  you wanted to  pass on to  this new  young buck  that came in  and it's all  in the dumpster  your whole  life  yeah  as you carry  out that box  with your  nameplate on  top and a  plant  you should  tell you what  never mind  having to go  REM this is  the most  depressing show 
[01:12:00]  I've ever  yeah it's  really bad  today  well  it's depression  Friday  I recommend  about Schmidt  I want to  get your  take on the  whole movie  because it  gets more  and more  depressing as  the film  goes on  and then  you just  have to  start laughing  at this  thing  because  everything  goes wrong  for this  poor guy  because then  I guess  he's feeling  a little  nostalgic  and he  wants to  go see  his  childhood  home  because  you  kind of  search  for your  roots  when you  go through  situations  like that  well  so  do you  know 
[01:12:30]  what  surprisingly  I have  a problem  with things  I can't  watch really  depressing  things  really  I can  hand it  out  I can  do it  and I  sort of  revel in  it  but I  can't  stand  sort of  cringeworthy  stuff  or depressing  stuff  I can't  it hurts  me  I live  for it  I really  do  Anthony's  going to  tell you  a part  of this  movie  but before  that  so now  you've  got Jack  he's  retired  he at  least  has  his  wife  he goes  home  and he 
[01:13:00]  finds  her dead  with the  vacuum  cleaner  running  she had  some kind  of aneurysm  and just  dropped dead  and the way  she's laying  there on the  floor  the vacuum  cleaner's  running  so you  could tell  she was  vacuuming  and she's  laying on  the floor  and her  shoe  is slightly  off her  foot  it's slightly  askew  and it's  just a  scene like  oh that's  how you  find dead  people  at least  you take  solace  in the  fact that  he's  going to  now enjoy  his  retirement  with his  old  wife  been married  for many  years  well he  doesn't get  that  so then 
[01:13:30]  he decides  well I'm  going to  go see  my daughter  who hates  my guts  so he gets  an RV  and travels  across America  and that's  where the story  picks up  where he wants  to check out  his childhood  home  check out  his old  childhood  home  a little  nostalgia  remember when  times were  better  and he gets  to the place  where his  house was  and there's  a tire store  there  they had  knocked his  house down  and built  a tire store  so he's in  the tire store  trying to imagine  where his old  bedroom was  and there  were some  nice tires  on display  where his  bed used  to be  dude 
[01:14:00]  I laughed  so effing  hard  and that's  the scene  where I said  you know what  I know they're  like pulling at  your emotions  here  I'm going  the other  way with  this  I started  making it  into a comedy  in my head  and some people  hold on  you mean it  was meant to  be quite  there was  pathos  this wasn't  meant to be  black comedy  it was  pathos  I gotta be  honest with you  Ricky  I don't know  to this day  because some  people  you've ruined  it for me  if it is  then  I will only  ever laugh  now when I  see that  you'll laugh  anyway  because some  people  when I saw  it in the 
[01:14:30]  theater  people were  crying throughout  the whole  movie  and I  I decided  it has to  be a black  comedy  and that's  when the  old ladies  yelled at  me for  laughing at  this horrific  stuff that  was going  on  yeah but  you may  have  sort of  psychopathic  tendencies  I mean  you probably  could be  quite a good  serial killer  and not get  caught  hey that's a  compliment  thank you  Ricky  my pleasure  yes  but Ricky's  calling to  promote  out of  England  I called  in for a  review of  a film  that was  out five  years ago  yeah I know 
[01:15:00]  I'm sorry  what a bunch  of tools  you're absolutely  right  but we  figured we  would bring  you into  our world  and we're  kind of  living this  about  Schmidt  thing  right now  because a  guy that's  been here  forever  when he was  a young  buck  is being  shown the  door  and let's  be honest  there's no  hope for  the guy  he's 63  oh god  so we're  living some  kind of  black comedy  thing ourselves  today  we really  are  well what  about  voluntary  euthanasia  has he  thought about  hey Ricky  you ever 
[01:15:30]  see this  movie  Jaws by  this kid  named  Spielberg  it's  amazing  go see  that one  rumor  can you  can you  can you  both  go through  it  in some  detail  you suck  I love  this guy  supposedly  they're going  to remake  Jaws  there's  some  rumblings  yeah  there's  a little  chatter  but Ricky  you got an  HBO special  out of  England  now is  this the  one I  saw  when you  were in  New York  yes  it's the  one I  did in  the  Kodak 
[01:16:00]  in Madison  Square  Gardens  where you  had our  buddy  Louis C.K.  warm up  oh yes  okay  oh he  really  remembered  Louis  how is  Louis  oh he's  great  he's  honestly  he's  blown up  I mean  he's  he had  a  a  showtime  special  that  did  very  very  well  but  no I  asked  that  because  I  was  at  that  show  it's  amazing  and  now  I  can  highly  recommend  this  thing  yeah  thank  you  highly  recommend  the  one  where  your  name  is  spelled  out  in  like  10  foot  look at  me  letters  exactly  that  I 
[01:16:30]  how pompous  your intro  was just  hilarious  he comes  out like  he is  like  the  cat's  meow  yeah  but  alright  Ricky  I did  that  I've  always  worried  about  comedians  who  wish  they  were  rock  stars  and  it  starts  off  and  they  come  out  and  it's  like  they  play  stadiums  and  the  first 
[01:17:00]  10  minutes  of  their  show  is  them  running  around  sort  of  like  touching  hands  and  getting  I  a  fucking  joke  oh  I'm  sorry  we  don't  care  sorry  about  that  I did  that  yeah  how much  time  do we  have  sorry  about  that  it's  all  good  alright  wait  did you  explain  your  story  well  no  it's  like  a  bit  of  a  mickey  take  of  the  pomposity  of  a  comedian  who  gets  above  his  station  and  of  course  I  deconstruct  it  because  I  think 
[01:17:30]  when  people  saw  some  people  in  England  didn't  get  was  actually  showing  off  they  didn't  get  the  fact  that  we  spent  the  entire  budget  on  that  just  me  and  a  microphone  now  oh  they  didn't  get  the  joke  no  well  half  of  them  were  going  oh  why  is  he  showing  off  are  you  kidding  it was  so obvious  of  course  some  people  think  when  I  get  the  award  to  me  some  of  my  speeches  they  they  literally  take  it  on  face  value  it's  quite  stunning  some  people 
[01:18:00]  genuinely  when I  first  came out  thought  that I  did  find  famine  funny  and  they  just  didn't  get  the  irony  because  I  didn't  do  enough  nods  and  winks  to  the  camera  oh  you  can't  legislate  against  stupidity  but  you'd  be  stunned  at  the  people  who  really  don't  get  it  but  it  wasn't  in  America  right  I'm  still  relieved  when  people  do  get  it  you  should  take  that  as  read  but  I'm  still  relieved  really  but  in  England  they  didn't  get  what  you  were  going  for  he  obviously  came  out  like  Elvis  yeah  he  came  out  like  Elvis  to 
[01:18:30]  do  like  you  know  his  jokes  and  also  I  did  you know  I  I've  seen  shows  where  comedians  before  they  come  on  do  a  clip  reel  of  their  CV  I  stopped  doing  that  yeah  we got  Rich  Vosses  you know  I saw  him in  that  yeah  saw  him in  that  as well  I can't  wait to  see the  person  I've  come  to  see  one  of my  favorite  things  is the  slamming  down  of the  mic  when  you're  done  thank  you  good  night  and  the  comic  throws  the  mic  on  the  floor  and 
[01:19:00]  you  there  really  are  two  types  of  comedians  comedians  that  come  off  and  go  oh  I  sucked  I  ruined  that  one  I  did  oh  god  and  the  comedians  come  off  like  Malcolm X  thing  like  they're  getting  something  done  something  important  done  for  everybody  changing  the world  my second  tour in  England  was called  politics  and I  went out  there  and I  was going  it's time  to give  a little  bit  something  back 
[01:19:30]  you know  like I  was really  trying to  change  the world  of course  I took  on the  wrong  targets  and I  got  everything  wrong  I sided  with  the  conglomerates  and  the  powerful  people  and had  a go  at  Gandhi  for being  a bit  sarcastic  you  you know  who was  the most  pompous  performer  I ever  saw  and it  wasn't  a comedian  it was  David Copperfield  I was in  Vegas  and every  time I  go out  there  I try  to see  some  kind  of  show  and  one  year  I  decided  David  Copperfield 
[01:20:00]  what a  mistake  and he  did  the  whole  montage  of  look  how  great  I  am  before  he  came  on  stage  to  take  your  girl  to  rape  island  they  think  I  better  remind  them  I  know  they  paid  $100  but I  better  remind  them  that  they're  here  to  see  something  good  yeah  exactly  it's  like  he's  bamboozling  you  yeah  I know  it's  very strange  what's  happened to  David Blaine  because the  last thing  he was  what did  he do  he sat  in a  bucket  for a  year  last  what was  that  no  you missed  the latest  one 
[01:20:30]  he finally  got caught  for being  the hack  that we  all knew  he always  was  he hung  upside down  here in  Central Park  and it was  a complete  bust  complete bust  because too  many doctors  told him  look you're  going to get  like a brain  hemorrhage  if you hang  upside down  that long  so every  like 15  minutes  they would  hoist him  up and he  would stand  up upright  for like  five minutes  and then  back upside  down again  but my  point is  this  even if  he could  hang  upside  down  why 
[01:21:00]  who cares  people  get into  the Guinness  Book of  Records  for balancing  a milk  bottle on  their head  I don't  care  no one's  going to  beat that  record  because no  one cares  you know  what's so  pathetic about  David Blaine's  tricks  they're all  old radio  stunts  what  they're all  old morning  zoo radio  stunts  that like  the hacky  morning show  would do  in these  towns  there's been  a million  guys that  have been  buried alive  there's been  a million  guys that 
[01:21:30]  have hung  out in  a block  of ice  and these  are all  David Blaine  stunts  the morning  guys  have done  the Guinness  Book of  Records  and someone  said  oh we  want to  break the  world record  for the most  people in  their underpants  I'll go  no you've  got it  don't do it  you've got  it  don't worry  about it  it's a record  just don't  bother anyone  with it  there's so many  people who  just want to  do a charity  song  a novelty  charity song  no we'll give you  the money  don't do it  do not  release that  song  here's a million  pounds  give us the  charity a choice  it's just 
[01:22:00]  attention seeking  I want to  stop all  their fun  in the pretend  name of charity  or trying to  break the record  and just go  no it's fine  here's your  money  we know you'd  really do it  but just don't  yeah  what about when  David Blaine  held his breath  for like 15  minutes or  something  oh underwater  the kid that  came back in  England that was  missing when he  smelled his mom  he held his  breath for 16  minutes  that's rich  boss  I'm a big  guy  look at you 
[01:22:30]  tying everything  together nicely  hey uh  Ricky for the  people that did  not see the  HBO special  you know the  live uh  you know the  live thing here  Ricky Gervais out  of England  what are you  skewing  what are you  going after  with this  special  I'm going  after all the  big targets  in this one  um  uh  Hitler  um  Stephen Hawking  I mean he's  got away with  murder for way  too long  yes  he needs to  be brought  down a peg  or two  all the 
[01:23:00]  all the big  comedy subjects  really  cancer  the holocaust  you know  the big  just the really  big  funny ones  do you go  into the clubs  in England  and still do  spots in England  when you're  I don't really  because  uh  they sort of  don't help  me  that sort of  bear garden  where people  are sort of  you know  sort of  shouting out  in the bar  and still  packing ice  so what I do  is I hire  a tiny theatre  and um  do a secret  gig  so I do it  out through  a mail out  or something  so I get 
[01:23:30]  an audience  but um  you know  I can at least  try the stuff  out  because also  my stuff  isn't  shouting  and sort of  I don't do  comedy that cuts  through alcohol  to be honest  um  I have to  sort of  I do a lot  of acting out  and a lot  of mumbling  and a lot  of  I mean  strangely  and I didn't  I only realised  it's in retrospect  I do a lot  of um  uh  silent comedy  body language  I get laughs  out of doing  nothing if you  know what I mean  so it just  doesn't work  in a club  that they want  they want  gags  and they want 
[01:24:00]  shouting  and they want  they want  comedians  who are angry  pretend angry  with the world  they say  doesn't it annoy  you when you  go through customs  and they say  take your shoes  off  no it doesn't  doesn't annoy  me at all  they're checking  for bombs  no doesn't  annoy  what do you  mean  they're doing  their job  it's just  oh shut up  but  like I did  when I was in England  I did a place  called Junglers  in I think Camden  and it would have  been easier  to work a knife  fight  than one of those  comedians  that is the 
[01:24:30]  example of those  yeah  and it's  those comedians  and come out  and do the  difference between  you know black  guys drive a car  like this  whereas white  guys they're  more like this  people are laughing  well yeah  it's  for places like  that are for  people who've  never seen  comedy before  they can't  believe a guy  is making  an observation  it doesn't have  to be funny  or true  yeah it doesn't  even have to  be funny  anymore  it's just  an observation  exactly yeah  isn't it funny  when you go out 
[01:25:00]  in the rain  you take an  umbrella  it sort of  keeps it  off your head  for a little while  yeah I do  that  wow  well the worst  the worst comic  to me is the  guy that you  see shadow  boxing before  he goes on  like it's a  real big prize  fight  okay  exactly yeah  this is pretty  much life or  death  he's changing  the world  he better be  fit  he's shadow  boxing  it's him  against the  audience man  yeah  yeah  yeah  he's already  high-fiving  coming off 
[01:25:30]  yeah  yeah I cannot  stand the  the MC  comic  camaraderie  that is so  fake  like the hug  and the little  whisper like  go get him  guy  like what is  that just get  up and do  your act  and stop  with the  phony  shaking hands  and ladies  gentlemen  let's hear it  a big round  of applause  shut up  if the people  aren't clapping  some other hack  isn't going to  get me to clap  and you know  I don't want  people to go  hey it's not  a pep rally  just go 
[01:26:00]  our next act  it's not  you know  I don't  are you ready  for our next  comedian  ladies and gentlemen  and like sheep  yeah  cheer  go absolutely  crazy  for probably  my favorite  comedian  on the circuit  yeah  then you have to  look down at the  paper  and here's how  important he is  you might have  seen him on  Jay Leno  oh okay  well if he was  on Leno  then he's got  to be good  oh  oh god  next comic  you might  recognize him  if you were  in the lobby  before the show  because he stinks 
[01:26:30]  and so do I  it just has  no bearing  on the comedian  and it seems  like such an  archaic  vaudevillian  thing  like they  haven't changed  that for years  you could watch  a young comedian  special  from the 80s  and the comics  are brought up  and let off  the stage  the same way  yeah I know  the problem  is  it's too easy  to get good  enough  to make a  room full of  people laugh  harder than  they have  before 
[01:27:00]  yeah  that's the  problem  you know  and my  mate Steve  Merchant  was doing  an act  and he does  this act  where he  goes out  there and  it's just  so brave  and he's  meant to be  bad  and he does  things and he  gets groans  he does bad  jokes on purpose  and he goes  oh not good  enough for you  he said I'm  huge in the  West Country  and he starts  doing that  thing that  comedians do  they loved  this last  night  they loved  this last  night  and people  get really  uneasy  okay  and obviously  5% of the 
[01:27:30]  audience  it's the best  thing they've  ever seen  the rest are  going  why is he  telling us  that  he's awful  right  and before  he went on  there was  this guy  doing the  difference  between cats  and dogs  and men  and women  and that  and he  said he  didn't want  to go on  he said  because he  knew he  couldn't make  them laugh  any more  than they  were at  this worst  comedy I've  ever seen  and it's  just so  strange that  he just  thought it  doesn't count  if they  laugh it  doesn't count  because they  just laughed  at the  difference  between a  cat and a  dog  and if they 
[01:28:00]  don't laugh  why am I  doing it  but it's so  strange it  must be so  demoralizing  to innovative  comedians who  are trying  to ask but  they have to  go on after  someone who  regurgitates  goldfish  do you know  what I mean  it's so easy  a perfect  example of  that  I just  walked into  the studio  this comic  how  oh  Jesus  would you  leave Mike  Bigley  alone  do you know  a guy in  England named  John Feely  do you know 
[01:28:30]  John Feely  I don't know  he's kind of  he's like a  great comic  oh that's  wonderful Rich  way to bring  up something  that maybe  one person  would care  about out  there  yeah sorry  I asked one  question I just  want to see  how my friend  was doing  you had a  couple good  questions in  there and you  blew it with  the dumb  and Rich  were you going  to bring up  the fact that  Mike Birbiglia  got a really  good review on  his one man  show in  something called  the New York  Times  actually I'm  looking forward  to seeing his  one man show  because Mike 
[01:29:00]  and I are  buddies now  alright good  really  we'll talk  about that  after the break  but we gotta  say thanks to  Ricky Gervais  Ricky you gotta  come in here and  hang like you  did that  one time  well I'm probably  not back now  until after  Christmas but  I was chock-a-block  doing this thing  and I always  love I've been  in once and  phoned in about  three times so  I've gotta get  that average  back  it's always a  pleasure I'm  sorry I swore  oh we don't  care about that  people complain  to me I'm  very sorry  make it up  to us by  mentioning us  on your blog  we love when  you do that  I will I did

[01:31:00]  sacrificed  all my  interests  to those  of the  country  I go  but you  my friends  will continue  to serve  France  her happiness  was my  only thought  it will still  be the object  of my wishes  do not regret  my fate  if I have  consented  to survive  it is to  serve your  glory  I know  it's you  though  it's a very 
[01:31:30]  special  Opinante  show  haunting  I hurt  myself  today  to see  if I  still  feel  I focus  on the  pain  the only  thing  that's 
[01:32:00]  real  I'll be  don't be  so upset  I got a  story about  this song  by the way  very sad  day  it's the  Opinante  show  Steve Freed  he spent  41 years  with CBS  radio  Mike  who's now  in studio  with us  and he's  being shown  the door  today  I know  I heard  with nothing  pretty much  nothing  we're giving  him an  omelet  that we  decided  was the  right  thing 
[01:32:30]  to do  wow  little piece  of steak  too  a little  piece  of steak  that seems  fair  very good  41 year  reality show  and he was  voted off  today  yeah  that's pretty  much it  and yeah  if you start  with a company  and they say  well after 41  years you're  going to get  an omelet  and a piece  of steak  would you  take that  deal  no  leave  immediately  I try to  find something  better right  my application  and go  somewhere else  and people  can I tell you  a quick story  about that 
[01:33:00]  hurt song  this is how  much of an  ass I am  not only on  the radio  but in my  regular life  someone really  close to our  family died  and it was  very tragic  and we were  getting ready  for the wake  and the funeral  and the three  days of walking  around like a  zombie  crying your eyes  out because  that's what  you gotta do  I guess  and then you  allow everyone  else's sadness  to make it  even worse  and now  you were in a  situation where  you weren't  gonna cry  but now you  have to cry  because everyone  else is crying  and making it  even worse  anyway  wow  so my sister  flies up from  Florida 
[01:33:30]  and this  Johnny Cash  version of  Hurt was  all over  MTV  the video  remember how  creepy the  video was  oh yeah  I thought it  was the  coolest thing  and I wanted  to share how  cool this video  was to my  sister  who doesn't  live in the  shock jock world  by the way  and I go  oh you gotta  see this video  and what Johnny  Cash does  with this song  and she's  thinking it's a  little escape  from all the  horrendous  sadness  that's going  around us  so she's  like oh good  a moment  where we can  maybe not  think about  this person 
[01:34:00]  we all loved  and the fact  that they're  now dead  and we're  gonna go to  the wake  and the  funeral  and I go  yeah you  gotta see  Johnny Cash  and what he  did with  this song  within 30  seconds  she's running  out of the  room crying  her eyes out  and I'm like  oh yeah maybe  this would be  really sad  for somebody  I forgot  and then you  got dressed  yeah then I  whatever but  Mike Birbigli  in studio  and the one  man show  we bow to  you today  thanks  the New York  Times gave  your one man  show just an 
[01:34:30]  amazing review  right  yes  he reads the  New York  Times I  don't  Wall Street  Journal New  York Times  guy over here  said Mike  Birbigli a great  review in the  Times  yeah it was  very exciting  because they  had actually  written a feature  on the show  but not a  review last week  and it just so  happened it was  on November 5th  which was the  biggest New York  Times newspaper  in history that  no one read  yeah they just  it was the Obama  day  collector's item  yeah and it  was just  immediately in a 
[01:35:00]  hermetically sealed  baggie and on  eBay for hundreds  of dollars so the  readership wasn't  very high on page  C2  did you know they  were in the audience  reviewing you the  night they came  yeah it was this  past Tuesday night  it was our opening  night it was really  stressful because  there was like you  know some stars  there and it was  it was stressful  you know it  wasn't like paid  house fans anything  like that it was  just kind of like  you know friends  and friends family  red carpet  who was the biggest  star and don't say 
[01:35:30]  Uncle Floyd  it was Uncle Floyd  we brought him up  earlier  don't say we  who's the biggest  star though  because I'd be a  nervous wreck  oh yeah I mean it  was pretty cool  because Nathan  Lane and Matthew  Broderick were both  there  really  how do you perform  in front of those  guys  that's crazy  and Nathan Lane  pretty much discovered  you because he saw  you at Caroline  and said well I'll  I'll help finance  this thing right  he was well he  yeah he agreed to 
[01:36:00]  present the show  and he was there  the night you were  at Caroline's with  me  and yeah but  the yeah so the  times thing was like  very exciting because  you know people  respect that and  everything it was  like my almost  famous the the  Rolling Stone cover  moment  did you uh did  you um know it  was gonna be a  good review before  you cracked the  paper over  oh yeah  I know yeah I  got tipped off  all right all right  because I can't  imagine going like  well here it is 
[01:36:30]  make a break  just scathing  you see like  ugh  the first line is  ugh  right  oh boy  the thing about  reviews these days  is like it  doesn't really  matter what the  review is because  like you know a  lot of awful  movies have  we've all been  tricked by pull  quotes yeah  we've all been  like oh drill bit  taylor is a hit  uh you know uh  pluto nash is out  of this world and 
[01:37:00]  then you find out  they mean literally  the character  but they take it  more serious when  it comes to  broadway  new york times  broadway  stuff they can  make or break you  with a review  yeah that's what I  hear it's a little  different it's in all  the movies they wait  for the review to  come out the next  day yeah  broadway stuff  uh that we went  to see a play on  broadway the reviews  it closed within a  week really  yeah that's what  happens  within a week  but the whole play  was about death  or something  what was the play  i can't remember  the name  the life of steve  freed  no  something man 
[01:37:30]  or something  i gotta call  bonnie  you guys wanna  something man  you wanna talk  to steve freed  live  i think we should  alright we're  gonna get him in  here in a second  but um  also we teased  something we're  gonna do the  homeless shopping  spree this year  it looks like  yes  figure it all  out  and one of  our homeless  friends who  did the homeless  shopping spree  how many times  keith uh blue  was hold on i  just dumped it  really yeah i got  the button right  there did you  dump for everybody  yeah everybody's  dumped that's an  everyone everyone

[01:38:30]  average is pretty  good for homeless  people we've been  doing the homeless  shopping spree for a  few years and um  fact is we've we've  only two have died  there was little  ziggy we love  remember ziggy  he sang silent  night  uh and he and  he remember that  we we took him  out to uh what  what this homeless  shopping spree is we  take a bunch of  homeless people out  to a very exclusive  mall and let them  shop we give them  like you know a  hundred bucks or 
[01:39:00]  something and the  listeners chip in and  give them money  because there's  thousands of people  show up for this  and um ziggy  people embraced him  he was the cutest  little thing and  they bought him big  jackets fluffy coats  and uh shoes all  kinds of stuff  because that's what  he needs he did to  keep warm he's  homeless you know  and and the the  the uh best part of  the story was the  fact that after he  left he got the  crap beat out of him  by other homeless  people who then  stole everything  that he had gotten  on them that's the  streets for you 
[01:39:30]  just a limping zebra  on the plains of the  Serengeti  also that's what  he was man  also it's weird  because most people  shop until they  drop well with us  they shop until they  drop dead so  they even lost two  now great took his  william sonoma  waffle maker yes  that he could have  used out there on  the streets so  what making waffles  out of spit and  snot out of loogies  plugging it into a  lamppost yeah and  loogying into a  waffle maker and  you go on that  disgusting when

[01:45:00]  in your head  well  i've pretty much  accepted  the fact that i'm  leaving  yeah  but uh  not easy  it's  i'm leaving a lot  of very good  memories  yeah  oh  a lot of good  good  people i've met  yeah  do you have any  uh stories of uh  uh being with the  company that stand  out in your head  that you maybe  want to  tell any of those  uh memorable  moments  i don't know 
[01:45:30]  about any real  memorable stories  yeah  just working with  everybody i guess  working with  everybody  yeah  you actually ran  uh ran the sound  uh for woodstock  when uh  i was here  yeah you were here  to control when  everybody went to  woodstock  went to woodstock  you were here  like everyone else  was at woodstock  but you were here  i was i was here  at the station  really  wow  and uh you've  been here since uh  we were thinking  of things that  had happened  in history  from the time 
[01:46:00]  you started  working here  and it's amazing  the perspective  it puts it in  that uh you know  man hadn't been  on the moon yet  it's true  and uh  you know  woodstock  wasn't going to  happen for a  couple more years  uh everything  watergate  all that stuff  that happened  and uh you  were here  and then 41  years later  and uh  you know  they kind of  unceremoniously  kind of let you  go there  huh  yeah you wanted  to make it  to 65  right  i was hoping  to so  what did the  company tell you  i don't want to 
[01:46:30]  like get you  in any trouble  so if you don't  want to answer  that's fine  they didn't tell  me much of  anything  they told me  uh today  would be my  uh last day  on the payroll  don't you get  no  oh so you could  still come in  it's just your  last day on the  payroll  you know  trying to  bring a little  levity  wow  maybe now you  can go visit  woodstock  yeah  yeah  i don't know  any place you  want to see 
[01:47:00]  you want to  try  you know  now you  you've had a  lot of uh  sick time  built up and  stuff  you just didn't  take sick days  was that it  i uh  i didn't take  very much  except when i  was absolutely  absolutely  had a  i had a  major accident  yeah  and then i  took off  you had  accumulated  more of it  because you're  one of these  guys that just  don't take days  off  never did  because i've  always considered  when you get  older more  things happen to 
[01:47:30]  you and you  might need it  for  oh so you like  banking those  when you're  younger and  more healthy  when you get a  little older  not knowing that  you know the  rug was going to  be pulled out  and uh  you'd have all  those uh  sick days accrued  and uh  those kind of  disappear  jesus  yeah  what a bitch  seven months  of sick days  wow  you're gonna  collect those  seven months  what do you  mean no  no you gotta  collect those  man  um  well 
[01:48:00]  rich is just  shaking his  head  this is the  corporate world  we live in  today by the  way  no listen  no  it's a sad  old world  these days  no he has  seven months  he has seven  months and he  gets seven months  yeah i'm no one  to say  seven months  what do you  what do you run  this place  no but i'm just  saying as a  consumer  that's how as  a consumer  that's how  corporations work  yeah but he  could go to  people's court on  that  settle it in our 
[01:48:30]  forum the  people's court  my judgment for  the plaintiff  for three dollars  thanks  wow  so um  what uh  what do you  i i i don't want  to keep asking  what are you  going to do  but what  time do you  work till  today  what time  are you here  till  normally i'm  here till  about two  o'clock  till two  o'clock  so uh  as that hour  comes around  are you are  you packing up  stuff 
[01:49:00]  do you have  all your stuff  out  you're gonna  make that last  trip out  you don't know  office stuff  or a nameplate  something  a plant  you have a plant  no  so you're  just gonna  get on  the bus  and uh  take that  last bus  ride  home  have you  been taking  the bus  for the last  40 years  i've always  taken the  bus  yeah  you must  have known  many drivers  with driving  and the  traffic  yeah tell  me about  how long  is the bus  ride every  day  it takes 
[01:49:30]  me about  an hour  each way  an hour  on the bus  each way  for the last  40 years  40 years  one hour  a day  five days  a week  someone figured  out it's  well over  two years  550 hours  it is  21,000  and change  hours  so what is  that in  years  it's two  years and  three months  so you've  spent literally  two years  and three  months of  your life  on a bus  sitting in  a bus  two years 
[01:50:00]  three months  going back  and forth  on a bus  that is  astounding  and you're  going to be  taking the  bus home  for the last  time today  oh yeah  do you know  the bus  driver  or they have  different drivers  different drivers  each day  I don't take  the bus  I don't know  I get  aggravated  and I drive  in every  day  what am I  going to  tell you  wow  that's  that's  a bitch  when he  started  taking the  bus  the way  they sat  people  yes  it was  a lot  different  than  today  yeah  well  actually 
[01:50:30]  in 67  when you  started  blacks  were only  one year  into their  right to  vote  wow  so that  was  wow  and now  on  the day  your last  day  we are  looking  toward  another  month  or so  a little  more than  a month  away from  having  a black  president  meanwhile  when you  got your  job  they had  just  gotten  the right  to vote  look at  that  you ran  the gamut  what I  don't understand  in radio  you don't get  a two week  notice  you come 
[01:51:00]  I mean  I can see  two week  notice  don't you  notice  this business  as far as  that goes  blows  we never  know when  we're going  to have  our last  show  it's different  for you guys  because you're  on the air  they do  with behind  the scenes  people too  what  I've been  here 20  years  and what  today's my  last day  radio's  cutthroat  it's a  cutthroat  business  beyond cutthroat  it is beyond  cutthroat  yeah  Steve any  thoughts  for the  people coming  behind you 
[01:51:30]  any philosophy  anything you  want to say  take your  vacation days  maybe that's  a good  piece of  advice  yeah you  have you  know 40  some odd  years or 41  years of  experience in  this business  maybe you  could pass  on some  knowledge to  some of the  people coming  in  young Sam  it's a  good  it's a  good  feel to  go into  if you're  young  if you're  single  but being 
[01:52:00]  the way  the nature  of this  business  is now  with lack  of security  and going  from contract  to contract  to rating  period  to rating  period  you're  probably  better off  going  getting a  regular  9 to 5  job  with your  regular  benefits  and  go home  at the end  of the day  and forget  about the  job  with here  you sort  of become 
[01:52:30]  married to  it  you get  calls at  night  you can't  find a  commercial  spot  or you  can't  find  something  and you  go home  at the end  of the day  enjoy your  family  and have  a real  life  weren't you  saying in the  hall that you  would have been  better off being  a garbage  man  as far as  being taken  care of  security  and being  taken care  of  probably 
[01:53:00]  they have  a lot of  a lot of  civil service  jobs have  a lot of  benefits that  in this industry  we don't have  that just shows  you know  that you  you were  you were  there for  the job  also  you had a  commitment  that transcended  the hours  that you were  supposed to  work  because people  could call you  at night  and say  hey  you know  steve  where's  this  or  i need  this  and  you know  you  you  you were  on call 
[01:53:30]  all the  time  pretty much  and  that's  pretty noble  you don't see  a lot of  that  in this  day and age  and  and then  i don't know  to just cut  you loose  like that  jesus  these corporations  these days  because what  he did  and he  probably  and like  i don't  know him  like you  but he  did a  great job  for 40  years  and you  don't want  to have  to leave  thinking  what did  i do  you  he did  nothing  you know  what i  mean  he did  nothing  but show  up and 
[01:54:00]  do his  job  and  and you  know  it's  it's  ridiculous  it's  real  you got  to go  see  mike's  one  man  show  if you  want  to  cheer  up  steve  what are  you um  what are  you worried  about as  you as  you you  know  leave  this  company  that's  good  get a  little  insight  well  me like  everybody  else  is worrying  about  the  the future  i mean  what  you know  how long  will your  savings  that you  have  last 
[01:54:30]  will it  will you  outlast  your  you know  your savings  yeah  and most  a lot  of people  in this  country  today  have that  same  problem  yeah  especially  with the  economy  the way  it is  yeah  yeah  if you  invest  money  uh  you know  you're  looking at  a lot  less than  than you  thought  you had  and uh  wow  yeah  especially  people  retiring  what about  um  health  insurance  uh  i have 
[01:55:00]  health  insurance  for one  more year  and then i  have to  go find  my own  oof  yeah  that's  nice and  cheap  cobra  wow  carryover  benefits  retroactive  yeah  cobra  stands for  that's what  it does  yeah  yeah  two years  you get  two years  cobra  well steve  have you  enjoyed the  omelets  absolutely  i want to  thank you  very much  for this  beautiful  uh  affair  well it 
[01:55:30]  certainly  isn't uh  you know  worthy of  41 years  of service  i think  at least  a gold  watch  might have  been nice  you know  you always  think you're  going to get  the gold  watch  that's engraved  thank you for  your years  of service  but you get  a gold  omelet  it is golden  brown  they do make  a damn  good omelet  i gotta say  unless uh  you're  having egg whites  maybe you should  have the yolk  today  at this point  yolk it up  yolk it up  yolk it up  listen  yolk in there  man  thank you for 
[01:56:00]  the thoughts  yolk  cook it in  lard  we're going  to take a  break  we're going  to wrap up  steve freed's  farewell show  after the break  steve if you  um  what what  no no  but we got  steve freed  wanted to sing  a little song  for everybody  i also heard  uh  i just want  to talk to steve  because we've  never spoke  about this  steve is a  gun enthusiast  as am myself  i thought i  mentioned that  to you once  in the hall  yeah in the  hall  in the hall  but we never  really discussed  it or anything  yeah  i remember that  you told me  yeah 
[01:56:30]  i have  you have a few  you go to the  range and uh  pop off a few  yeah it's a lot  of fun isn't it  absolutely  so you see maybe  you spend a little  more time at the  range  you know you  you meet people  there you get to  know people there  yeah  you know it's  always fun  meeting a  hobbyist of  a similar ilk  absolutely  yeah  you know maybe  i'll see you  down there  trade uh  trade off some  guns  have some fun  blasting off a 
[01:57:00]  few rounds  make believe the  targets are certain  people  listen we gotta  take a break  uh we'll wrap up  with steve next  but uh  no no  we got steve  singing a little  song as we go  to break  we'll do that at  the end but we  have steve sing a  little song for  everybody as we  go to break  and i find it  kind of funny  i find it kind  of sad  the dreams in  which i'm dying  the best i've  ever had  i find it hard 
[01:57:30]  to tell you  cause i find it  hard to take  when people run  in circles  the very very  bad world  bad world  it's a very special  opian anthony show

[02:15:00]  it's merger  but it's still sad  as hell  because you're getting  these uh  goodbye emails  every 10-15 minutes  from people saying  goodbye  and they've  they have 20-30  years of experience  and they're  and this is their  last day today  so  it's just really weird  a lot of consulting  firms opening up  monday  jenny and i talk  about sometimes  you know  the concept that  if the economy  gets so bad  living with our  parents  a lot of people  do that during  the depression  we like debate  like who would be  worse to live with  because then you  would have to choose  like yeah we're 
[02:15:30]  both out of work  and now we got to  go move back in  with our parents  who's parents  yeah  do you go to  oh  we talk it out  all the time  her parents  yeah she works  but she works  for an internet  company  really  so you know  who knows  i shouldn't say  that but uh  i'm proud to say  that i would uh  i would pick uh  my girl's parents  over my uh  over my mom  yeah  no problem  i would too yeah  i don't think  there's room in the  home for me and  my girl if uh  things go bad  i am so  fucking nervous  now  why 
[02:16:00]  i'm just thinking  three kids  a wife that  barely works  because she's  home with a baby  uh mortgage  uh it's just  you know what  you're a comic  how who could  fire you  yeah  fire me  i had a club  call me  i called this  club  just they're  insane  the guy  in atlantic city  he calls me  and says  well we're  booked to 2010  but what kind  of money do you  want  i go why are we  talking money  from a year and a  half away  if it's cheaper  than somebody  that's booked  in 2010  yeah then you're in  then he said  well you might  have to come in 
[02:16:30]  your first time  as a middle  i go do you  know who you're  fucking talking  to  i got three  specials  i said well  it's insane  our business  you say you're  a comic but  they're fucking  completely insane  these places  it's just  you're dealing  so you guys  deal with maybe  one or two  insane bosses  what are you  talking about  we deal with  a different boss  every week  so do we  it's true  when you're  self employed  it really is  desperate 
[02:17:00]  it's kind of like  when you check  your email  it's like a slot  machine  you're like  what am i doing  next week  all right  nothing  yeah  i know  i know what  you mean  because i was  just thinking  you know  you're a stand-up  comic so you  could always work  you just find  some club  and yeah  fucking  instead of  you know  10 gigs  you do 20  yeah  to make up  for it  look  there was a  time i went  on between  strippers  i don't want  to do that  again  no one wants  to go back  to a place  they were at  we used to  do a club 
[02:17:30]  where we'd  go on between  nude strippers  yeah  in phillipsburg  nobody  you want to  go up  i mean  well yeah  you don't have  to try to sell  me on that  concept  i realize  you know  i'm kind of  in the same  business  kind of  it's a thing  there  i really don't  want to go  backwards  i don't want  to look like  dem  in two years  what are you  doing to our  listeners  studio audience  what  eroc comes in  eroc is  oh no  what now  eroc's holding  his blackberry  he's got a  smile on his face 
[02:18:00]  yeah  uh it's starting  again because  the same person  who was sending  out all the  uh goodbyes  yesterday  yeah  must have just  got in the  office  because uh  the first one  is coming in  a whole new  slew of goodbyes  of contact  infos  goodbyes  and what they  did here at  the company  and who's  saying goodbye  right now  the guy who  hated the fact  that we had  a shit dick  sign in the  studio  from the  broadway channel  he's gone  yeah  what do you  say  who  john von  susten  oh  john von  susten 
[02:18:30]  i don't remember  him  we hardly knew  ye  tall dude  had coke  bottle glasses  yeah white  hair  white hair  sucks that  he's  bye bye  sorry  getting fired  no i'm really  i'm really  like serious  saying like  you know  it does suck  that people are  getting fired  no matter what  your personal  it's been a great  seven and a half  years for me  say every time  you hear  lately i've been  keeping my  blackberry off  it's a form  letter they just  gotta add in  how many years  you've been here  and put your  fucking name on  lately i've  i've put this 
[02:19:00]  on quiet but  today i gotta  keep it on  and when you  hear my blackberry  go off  it means  somebody else  got fired  okay  email  uh it's a  great it's  been a great  seven and a  half years  for me  at xm  from the  exciting  pre-launch  days  oh god  the pre-launch  remember pre-launch  oh my god  i remember that  remember when we  launched rock  and roll  the two satellites  my only regret is  that i didn't get  to know most of  you better but  that was only  because of the  200 miles  separating us  we changed the 
[02:19:30]  name of the  satellites to  bank and  rupt  nobody writes  he didn't write  that my regret is  i didn't get  that  my only regret is  i wasn't able to  give my life  for this  no he did because  there's like real  people out there  they're like kind of  nerdy people that  really you know  write that kind of  stuff  and he ends with  till we meet again  and i hope we will  what  so  the firings  the firings in the  lamps will really  separate the uh 
[02:20:00]  the friends from  the work friends  yeah that's true  a lot of that kind  of like so i'll see  you outside of here  you know dude  just cause i'm not  working here doesn't  mean we can't hang  still and go out  yeah that never  works fast forward  three hours  yeah that never  works  who's this bill  at the tone please  leave a message  yeah  oh man  there are so many  people in radio that  like you you work  with you get the  boot or they get 
[02:20:30]  the boot and you  were like really good  friends with them  i remember people at  aaf hanging out at  bars where you'd go  out because part of  the gig was going to  bar appearances  so you're out with  these guys you're  drinking you're you  know you're spilling  your guts to each  other over a little  too much drink and  shit so you consider  yourself friends and  stuff like that and  then the second you're  gone or they're gone  it's like it's like  they caught a fucking  bullet in normandy  you know it's just  like hey i love the  guy but here he is  his head's busted  apart and i gotta hit 
[02:21:00]  the beach i'm still  fucking you know i  still gotta take care  of these nazis up  here on the hill  and then you're like  why did i admit to  him that i sucked a  dick  because why did i  suck his dick  now he could use it  against me  fuck  yeah he goes on  the station against  you  and it's like yeah  that queer sucked a  dick  i had this thing i was  talking to my wife  last night and i was  telling her i was  telling her this story 
[02:21:30]  where i was like um  i was like yeah i was  this kid that i grew  up with you know when  we were teenagers we'd  let you know we'd  we'd smoke pot and  jerk off watch porn  and she's like what  what are you talking  about and i was like  you know i was like  you know when you're a  kid you fucking you  jerk off with the kids  and you watch porn she  was like people don't  do that she goes you  have to she's like you  gotta run that by some  other people before you  say that in front of  people yeah i was like  i was like no no that's  the thing i was like i 
[02:22:00]  go i said to her i go  i go uh i go norton and  uh norton and colin told  these stories about  sucking these guys  dicks when they were  kids like a couple  years ago montreal i  don't know if you guys  remember that yeah yeah  yeah monster rain it  was and uh and she  was like yeah but  that's an those are  isolated incidents i'm  like they're not that  isolated under a porch  yeah but i told that  story on the radio that  me and my friends used  to jerk off we used to  have you come home at  night that's not gay  when two guys jerk off 
[02:22:30]  it kind of is rich if  you touch the other  guy's dick then it's a  little gay i agree with  you so it's a little gay  yeah but it's not  rich i never had the  desire to jerk off in  front of another guy  though you know why  there's it's not an in  front of thing no you're  doing it together  yeah that's what i'm  saying well i was  distracted because  another employee just  got their wings that  someone's saying on  got their wings they're  getting their wings  i got distracted i got  i take it out of this  conversation so you  jerked off in front of  a guy and rich voss has 
[02:23:00]  yeah but it wasn't like  we were looking at each  other we were watching  porn jerking off you  have something called  peripheral vision  looking at each other  peripheral vision  you're seeing like some  type of movement here  we didn't see i can look  over here but if i if i  make a movement next day  i can see my hair yeah  yeah i didn't look at  him but i sat on his lap  as we did it  you know we did it me and  a couple friends i played  basketball growing up it  was all about peripheral  vision so there's no  fucking way i could get in  that situation first of  all there's something about 
[02:23:30]  it even though you're not  touching each other or  anything there's a moment  of of uh when you're  you're fucking coming  that is this this passionate  moment regardless if if  you're you're with yourself  it's still a passionate  moment yeah of of it's a  sexual release and it's  with another guy so you're  fucking there you're sharing  a moment regardless if you're  looking at each other but  when you're sharing i don't do  it now i'm talking about when  you're like 12 and you're  discovering hot teas but let's 
[02:24:00]  get into this for a second  like it's so easy to just say  it's it's gay okay but what  are you bonding over that's  like when you have friends as  kids you're bonding over like  bonding over the porn i  suppose you're bonding over  like maybe the latest black  sabbath or zeppelin or a cool  album that comes out or a movie  or maybe wrestling or something  whatever but wrestling how are  you bonding with your friend  over i remember when we  jerked off together i only had  like two hairs and he had  like a lot of hair and i was  jealous that he had a little 
[02:24:30]  hairless wrist i had a little  like two little hairs it was  like a little turkey like a  plucked chicken yeah it was  like a little  i don't think the ball bag  looked like a tight little  clamshell it was just like it  was a jew holding money that's  how tight it was i don't think  there was a i don't think  there's a visibility thing  though i think there are  socks involved it's just like  why wouldn't you do it  separately maybe watch the  porn together remember what we  don't watch porn we just  jerked off oh my god  wow you're at his mother i  was sleeping over his house  and his mother was in the 
[02:25:00]  next room why didn't mom  join in  she was drunk  you just pull the covers  down to see her ass a little  and jerk off on his mom's  ass  it'd be great  can i borrow your mom for a  second  nothing beats the jerking off  uh to a sleeping naked girl  and it's  it's fucking yeah i'm gonna  just scrap one out  there was times  when i was hammered once i  think i woke up with a  fucking rod and just  started fucking jacking off  come on the bed and go to 
[02:25:30]  sleep yeah go back and sleep  to guilt  yeah all right  girls like did we have sex  last night i did  why do you have to be guilty  because you come  because you jerk off it  depends you don't feel guilty  sometimes jerking off  no guilty jerking off  why why i don't know  what are you guilty of  it's a great feeling  jews are guilty of everything  wait i don't understand the  guilt where's the guilt come  from uh why are you guilty  of jerking off taking care of  yourself i don't know  it depends maybe it's you i'm  guilty of what i'm thinking  about when i'm doing it  oh okay well that must be 
[02:26:00]  fucking despicable  it was sometimes it was more  exciting  free teeth  was it  wasn't it more i don't know  about for you but for me it  was more exciting at times to  jerk off in front of a girl  than fucker like one time  like this is true i was  jerk off in front of a girl  and i shot a load through  two dunkin donut napkins  through two of them  no way  i'm not  i'm not fucking lying  that's impossible  no it's not impossible i  swear to god  but he couldn't through this  bounty paper towel  wow no that's definitely 
[02:26:30]  cool like jerking off like  that  yeah  fuck yeah  you're not gonna get an  argument there  i love the detail of the  two dunkin donuts  napkins  it really lends legitimacy  stuff came out the other  side is what you're saying  impossible  before you said napkins  i thought  before you said napkins  i thought you like shot it  through the hole of two  glazed donuts  like it was a trick  hey  we gotta  we gotta say hi to  russell brand  he's been calling all  morning long  we've had a crazy  show today  russell  hello there 
[02:27:00]  i'm really sorry but  we found out last minute  you were calling our show  today we love when you're  on our show but  we were really busy  so i apologize ahead of time  thanks for accommodating us  it's really really kind of  you and also i've just been  listening to the last five  minutes and to tell you the  truth i was masturbating to  that  ah there we go  at least we don't have to  see it  russell do you ever have that  as a kid  uh i've never masturbated in the  same room as another man but  i've been involved in a  threesome once with a friend  and it's sort of like i agree  with what you're saying about 
[02:27:30]  the moment of sexual euphoria  that it is like if you're not a  gay chap that it is  uncomfortable to share that  with another man  see i tried to look in the  other way which ruined my  enjoyment of looking at the  girl  anthony and i have lost that  argument because we'll bring up  the the threesome every once in a  while and like no way we can't  do it it kind of feels or not  like it would be a gay thing  and man the phones go nuts and  like i fucked a girl with my  best friend there's nothing gay  about it  guys will insist it's gay and  then other guys will insist  you're crazy it's the it's hot 
[02:28:00]  it's great  you're sharing with your bud i'm  like we always lose man there's  always more calls like saying  you know it's cool to do that  with your friend  you should know the risks i did  accidentally get a little bit of  ejaculant on my friend's leg and  he's never forgiven me  like you'll never watch gay porn  and that's not gay if you just  you know if you're experimenting  all right rich what's going on  that's something that's a little  not gay porn  you just said gay porn 
[02:28:30]  yeah well you know what i mean  two men having sex  yeah we know what you mean  rich  and also there's nothing wrong  with being gay it sounds to me  like an awful lot of fun  it does really like if you were gay  like the the the thing is you're  you just hey you want to fuck  all right yeah  yeah i'm saving  watching the game just guys just  sucking your dick  it's got to be so easy  fucking great  no obstacles  no strife  no efficient way to live  anthony brought up a good point  the other day he said that uh  he went in the back room with 
[02:29:00]  some of the guys around here  and they watched gay porn as a  goof and they were all laughing  their asses off  but when it came to the kiss  everyone was deeply  disgusted  like you could just watch a guy  tooling another guy in the ass  fucking balls deep in another  guy's asshole  and you're laughing and and  you're just hysterical  and then they kiss and you go  oh man i can't take this  that's gay  well but i said how many times  i said it's gayer to kiss a guy  than blow a guy  because kissing shows affection  all right you two kiss each other  and then blow each other  we'll be the judges  we'll be the judges 
[02:29:30]  mike for big league  and why would you  you're not gonna blow rich  well now that you're friends  i can't get past the teeth  are you kidding  i think it's hot  hey freddie mercury gave  some blow jaws  and you saw his teeth  come on  yeah look where he is now  there you go  well that's true  look hot right  see there's two guys  on the beach  tenderly kissing  hot right  one guy has his arm  on the other guy  is around his shoulders  and the other guy  has gently got his hand  resting on his abs  and they're making out  that is  that is  that's gay  that's way worse than 
[02:30:00]  fucking balls deep in the ass  that's not even gay  they're homos  right  yeah  all right listen  uh russell  hello there  hi russell brand everyone  are you  so what the hell happened  to you with your radio show  man  we were deeply depressed  you're a shock jock  you're a shock jock man  well you know  on the basis of a lot  you know  i said some things on air  that were a little bit  controversial  but however  i had to resign  because of that controversy  but on the basis  of the last five minutes  conversation  if this had been in england 
[02:30:30]  you would all be in prison  oh i know  yeah that's true  you can't say things about  you know  gays and things like that  right  yeah  right  no you can't  you know  yeah you have to be  sort of kind of a  like a little bit careful  and it's sort of  i think what happened is  i had a friend of mine  was on the show  and we got into a bit  of the spirit  of mucking about  forgot it was on the radio  a little bit  and some stuff got broadcast  that was like  a bit  a bit offensive  so but like  it's difficult for me  to consider it  in those terms  after like you know  i've been involved 
[02:31:00]  in a conversation  about masturbation  ejaculation  oral sex  standing on the beach  cupping each other's  buttocks  well that's the beauty  of satellite radio  my friend  right i see  now i can see  that we don't have  any worries over here  it's great  you just say literally  whatever you want to say  as long as it's morally  and spiritually correct  you can go nuts  we played your audio  you made a prank call  and um  and you were talking  to a answer machine  right  yeah that's right  yeah  i can't believe  you got fired over that  it's ridiculous  we played it 
[02:31:30]  it wasn't  you know  it wasn't bad  thank you very much  yeah it's a bit  like the thing was  as well  is that like  you know  you can see  when you say  oh leaving an  answer phone message  in which you tell  a grandfather  that you had sex  with his granddaughter  when you put it  in those cold terms  it's a bit rude  but his granddaughter  was in the satanic sluts  you know  there was a horde  of them  and you know  and uh  it was to tell you  the truth  it wasn't the intention  to leave that  on the answer phone  message when we rang  so we just thought  we'd have a little bit  of a chat  and then like  it all just  sort of got a little bit  out of hand really 
[02:32:00]  so but like  you know  in the ensuing publicity  the girl from the satanic  sluts has done  countless nude photo shoots  of course  in a way  the situation's been made  a little bit worse  and i don't know  how the rules work over there  but it's not an illegal  phone call right  you're just leaving  something on a voicemail  right no  it's not like  it's you know  yeah it really wasn't  it was i think  like what i'd say  it was a bit rude  it was a bit silly  because it might have  upset the granddad  but really you know  it wasn't like  it wasn't evil  or nasty  or anything  you know  so it was just 
[02:32:30]  it was a bit bonkers  i think everyone  got a bit carried away  how's the  did the outrage  calm down or  well yeah it did really  because i sort of  i was just kind of like  i mean to tell you  the truth  if it wasn't like  you know how  the way you're  the way you conduct  your radio show  i think you know  that your your audience  is all right with that  but if there's certain  people in america  that would listen to  your show and go  oh my god  what are these people  saying  my audience just thought  that's no big deal  but like what happened  was is that like  right wing media  drew it to the attention 
[02:33:00]  of people that were  offended by it  you know but like  you know but like  so there's some people  that if you  you know like  if they watch the  kind of pornography  that you watch  would have to open  a vein afterwards  you know so what  happened was is  a different demographic  became alerted to what  i do but that's  sort of irrelevant  because i don't work  for those people  the kind of people  that read those  newspapers that have  those kind of views  sure  i'm not i'm not  really interested in  them anyway  so it doesn't matter  so ultimately  it was just a big  load of noise  from people who  are not really  that interested  we uh we've had 
[02:33:30]  two high profile  firings and it's  always like it  it just gets  momentum after the  fact from the  media that that  forces the company  to fire you  yeah is what  happens  are you counting  steve's firing  as a high profile  firing  yeah  but you had a  high profile firing  of someone called  steve  no i'm sorry  yeah  we said uh  goodbye to a guy  that worked for uh  41 years for the  company today  and they get they  didn't even  ah whatever  they didn't do 
[02:34:00]  the right  ah whatever  they uh  they  ah whatever  oh dear  oh steve  well i'd like to  add my name to  the list of people  offering steve  all the best for  the future  yeah  63  yeah where's he  going  in england you  said the right  wing like  because in this  in america  here it'll be  the right wing  or left  politically correct  either one  will try to  have you fired  right  over there  it's just  basically  it's not  there's no  like political  correctness  it's more  of a right  wing type  thing over  there 
[02:34:30]  yeah that's  right  that's where  the moral  voice tends  to come from  but i suppose  whether it's  coming from  the left  or right  it's the same  thing  it's about  censorship  and control  so like  i don't  suppose it  really matters  what their  political  affiliations are  it's just  like they just  don't want  people to be  free  or anti-liberal  and i wish  that when  one of these  outrageous things  happens that a  company would hang  in there and  reap the benefits  of the exposure  this radio show  would get  yeah  you know  just one time  we're hoping  that they would 
[02:35:00]  hang in there  and see  what a boycott  could really get  done because  we don't believe  that a boycott  would be effective  in this day  no i think  it would just  consolidate the  audience  and the people  that love you  would stay  with you  and the people  that weren't  listening anyway  would continue  to not listen  right  yeah  you know  yeah  the broadcaster  or the company  in charge  of the transmission  if they stand  stronger  then they'll be  alright  but to tell you  the truth  the BBC  is a pretty 
[02:35:30]  amazing institution  and i thought  oh i don't want  to do any damage  to that  i think it's  a lovely old  thing  it's publicly  owned  it's kind of  sweet and charming  it's made loads  of things  and i've got loads  of stuff i'm doing  over here  and loads of  other work  in general  and i only did  the radio show  because it was fun  i got good money  for it  but i used to do it  because it was a laugh  with my mates  you know  and once it became  like you know  a load of aggravation  i thought i'm not  going to do it  and also to continue  to i think i'd have  to have continued  it under a great deal  of restriction  so i thought  oh no i'll just resign  i'm only doing it  for a laugh  i'm a stand-up comic  i do stand-up comedy 
[02:36:00]  i'm acting in films  i've got my own  tv production company  i write in a journal  i've got two books  published  i've got loads of  stuff to do  i'm only going to do  it if it's fun  you know  aren't you a braggart  i know  i'm great in bed  you can see my feelings  just send us a headshot  and we'll consider you  yeah  i call him an overachiever  i saw russell  did you guys see  russell host the vmas  oh yeah  yeah yeah  russell  i have to ask you  a question  cool man 
[02:36:30]  is the part  is the vmas  as much of a party  as they make it seem like  they make it seem like  it's just this  fucking non-stop party  it was not for me  it wasn't  it was like  really really hard work  was it  yeah yeah  it's difficult  because it's like  a corporate gig  i mean yeah  it's like  you know  it's very difficult  to keep all the energy up  and all that kind of stuff  and also  like for me  it's like  having a room  to be a little bit  outrageous  but without  sort of offending anybody  yeah  knocking a tightrope  a little bit 
[02:37:00]  i really enjoy  working for mtv  it's fantastic  but it's bloody hard work  and i didn't have a party  afterwards  i just  cleared off home  it's got to be  the toughest audience  industry audiences  are just brutal  they don't want to laugh  they're too serious  it's really difficult  i talk about that  in my stand-up  you know i'm doing this  comedy central  thank you for accommodating me  on your show  because that's what  i wanted to promote  actually i'm doing this  special for comedy central  right  and i talk all about  that vmas  and all the madness  oh really  death threats  i've got some death threats  i use a lot of 
[02:37:30]  jesus really  jesus i'm in Hartford  next week  what the death threats  over the political stuff  yeah yeah  death threats  over the political stuff  yeah but like  anonymous death threats  you kind of think  well at what point  did you send a death threat off  like i'd like you know  sort of  i just sort of like  would think a violent thought  maybe or  yeah well i send it off  anonymously  russell were you doing  uh this is mike berbiglia  i'm a comic as well  and uh  the uh  we were  you were at the bleaker street  theater after me last night  or the other night

[02:40:30]  it's a theater  a theater  a theater  what's a theater  a theater  where john wilkes  boo shot lincoln  in a theater  a theater  a theater  he also said  it was cool  talking to ricky  gervaisis  today  gervaisis  and what was  the other one  you said  i don't know  i don't keep track  of him  i love how he goes  ah whatever  when we correct him  because he's at the  point where he's  just like  yeah whatever  i was digging  through  unless you guys  are going to  something  nah  i was digging  through  whenever i get  like very mean  reviews  i always print them 
[02:41:00]  out and hang them  on the wall  really  yeah this is my  favorite one  is uh  because you know  you show up at  colleges a lot of  times and like  they you know  they'll forget  they've even  invited you  you know  they'll be like  oh yeah  so there's you  and then we  have a lip sync  contest  so i guess you  could host the  lip sync contest  like yeah that  that actually happened  one time i was  hosting a lip sync  contest  and uh  the woman  running the event  got up and she  was really upset  because there was  only two entries  to the contest  and she goes 
[02:41:30]  you know we  have this contest  every year  and in the past  we've had 15 or  20 entries  and this year  there were two  and we don't have  to have this contest  if you don't want  to have it  because i'm not  doing this for me  i'm doing this  for you  wow  and now the  comedian  mike berbiglian  after they were  just yelled at  by mommy  yeah  oh that  bitch  brutal  and you know  you have to do  your best  you know i  i was listening  to you guys  earlier talking  to gervais  about like how  these awful  emcees come on 
[02:42:00]  they're like  hey y'all  ready to laugh  you know  the worst part  is when emcees  are like y'all  ready to laugh  and then people  are like yeah  and you're like  i can't hear you  did you hear  i said  yeah and then  it's like  you fucking  is forcing me  yeah  i'm ready to  laugh  dick fuck  but i i showed  up at this uh  this is like  probably four or  five years ago  i showed up at  rhode island college  and they had me  performing in front  of a deli line  oh but the  students didn't 
[02:42:30]  know there was  going to be a  show  and so i  and then it got  reviewed by the  student paper  have you ever had  something like that  i'll tell you a  story after  go ahead  so this is a  review  rhode island college  has booked four  comedians for a  month-long comedy  series event  held in the  newly refurnished  student union  cafe slash  mailroom  no  oh my god  the comedy  series didn't  get off to the  right start  and by right  start i mean  it plummeted 
[02:43:00]  like a rock  off the fleet  building  mike berbiglia  having a quick  bit on comedy  central came into  town under a lot  of hype  sadly mike's  jokes weren't  strong enough  or even  good enough  to compete  with salisbury  steak  to hold up  the hype  the hype  of playing  a mailroom  yeah  oh okay  there were  enough stand-up  comedian mistakes  of that night  to fill the  grand canyon  this is like  third grade 
[02:43:30]  writing  and if he said  no one's laughing  one more time  he would have  won a free  toaster  the faces  were as stiff  as mount  rushmore  anyone monuments  this guy wants  to fucking  throw it to  the last line  i loved is  berbiglia had  a very weak  pitiful character  to him  weak pitiful  character  yeah  it's so sad  because the  writer clearly  hates me  but doesn't  know how to  express it  yeah  he expresses it 
[02:44:00]  like a third  grader doing a  book report  or something  yeah  like using  those childish  analogies  like plummet  like a rock  off of the  fleet  he's experimenting  with uh  with a  simile  colleges  have to be  one of the  worst  it's  we did  saint john's  in the courtyard  and we were  on there  and they were  pledging  sorority girls  it looked like  we were doing  the yard of  attica  so when no  one's listening  it's like

[02:55:00]  there mike burbigler  everybody's listening  we have a little fame  ourselves you know  a little bit  but usually when we're  in the new york times  it's not because  we're doing something  good  like yourself  so she listens  she listens  you know how you like  you know how like  you have a scrapbook  of all your nice  reviews and stuff  well we have a scrapbook  because what the hell  you should put those up  i have thousands  and thousands  of press clippings  no joke  they're in huge bins  now  and i could count  maybe on one hand  how many  good articles 
[02:55:30]  that anthony wrote  about him  and i show them off  like you show up  your reviews  well here's the time  we got fired in boston  right  yeah  here's all the  press clippings  on homeless charlie  here's our voyeur bus stuff  yeah that's pretty much  what ours consists of  that's so sad  can i ask you about  the boston thing  because i was growing up  there when that happened  yeah  no he wasn't really  yes  no i know  did you ever speak  directly to his wife  no  no  oh okay 
[02:56:00]  first of all  the wife thing  was all bullshit  his wife never  fucking heard it  oh  no one that knows  menino  or is close enough  to his family  listen to fucking  that adolescent rock station  we were on  uh  it was  they knew opie and anthony  we were on fucking wbz  we weren't doing the news  up there  yeah  so we  and it was such a  dopey  like you knew it was fake  when we said it  yeah  the way we put it  we knew it was fake  so for him to go  my wife  was very upset 
[02:56:30]  saying that i was killed  in the fog  because you did it  no one thought  he was dead  based on opie and anthony's  fucking news scoop  yeah  he was such a lying  crock of shit  that guy loves attention  so he could hold  his mayor job  like the pope  and he fucking  uh  used it  and it was april fool's day  too right  yeah it was april fool's day  and it wasn't even  believable  because i'd like to think  we did a good job  faking out everybody  i listened to the show  a couple years back 
[02:57:00]  it's so like  obvious  acting like a  sci-fi exclusive movie  right  i did a pilot  with you guys  i know how you act  so i couldn't have  been believable  you know who i saw  in boston  a couple  in worcester  uh  very good  a guy that was uh  in jail  a dj that was in jail  was in the audience  barrento  yeah  really  did he have a boy  on his lap  no  he's  is he out  oh yeah  oh yeah  no he  he had a weekend  a weekend  out furlough  and he came to my show  way out  yeah he got uh 
[02:57:30]  he got out  oh he did  yeah  he was in prison in  washington though right  for something he did  wasn't that in dc  yeah  when he worked for um  xm  yeah the early days  xm he worked  how about i'd like to  see that  i don't think he did  i remember the early  years when i used to  go perusing for young  boys  that's what the story  was  i don't think he did  it  dude you could say  it he served  fucking time for it  it's not allegedly  the guy's a convicted  fucking child molester  yeah  for fuck's sake  he drove around  with some  fucking children's  sake  an xbox console  and  in a van  and inner city

[03:16:00]  them  fucking  lost  correct terminology  exactly  exactly  is there anything  about the blackberry  storm that appeals to  the transsexual community  i that i don't know  honestly because  for most of us  and that's the  misconception is that  we are no different  than anybody else  come on  oh yeah no different  did you guys know  that i did i just 
[03:16:30]  learned something new  yeah  misconception  i thought they were  fucking weirdos  tell that to the  blood bank  yeah  no different  sure  oh yeah  the transgendered  community  yeah  than anybody else  our gender  is just  is underneath  is  is  is clouded by our  outside presentation  what do you think  about the claims  that the google phone 
[03:17:00]  is more friendly  to the transsexual  community  than the blackberry  is  i'll be honest with you  i don't know enough  about it  and if i don't know  enough about it  i don't like to  venture an opinion  i'll be honest with you  and say i don't know  enough i've heard a  little bit about it  but i wouldn't deceive  you and that's  you know  the claims are out  there  yeah  i like how  what do you  would comment  about the claims  that like people  have said  that the google phone  is so much more  better for the  transgendered community  and he's read a  little bit about it  yeah i heard about  a little bit  but not enough 
[03:17:30]  and i don't want to  you know  he doesn't want to  deceive you  good of him  it's the transgender  transsexual community  we don't different  than anybody else  can i suck your  cock  oh  hold on  yeah  can i suck  you're on a good  roll too  can i suck your  cock  i just want to  suck your  cock  oh boy  i just want to  well i i just  hope for the  guy's sake  because he's  obviously trying  to win the  son back  that he does  get the uh

[03:19:30]  let's go from  garp  all right  thanks rich  got a sound for  that too  that's a great  reference  yeah  all the old  movie references  you guys do  my name is  william  and i like  fingernail polish  oh  my name is  william and i  like to wear  dresses  dresses  i like william  how come you  never find a  real hot  transvestite 
[03:20:00]  they're always  like six  foot seven  because they're  men  no but  when you  watched a  movie what  was the  movie  wesley  sipes  and  no you  didn't  we all  laughed when  you said  it  we all  have  fucking  mass  hallucination  of the  ears  and here  you say  wesley  sipes  when you  really  you said  wesley  sipes  and leg  azamo  leg  azamo  i'll have  some of  the leg  azamo  please 
[03:20:30]  wesley  sipes  boss i  wish we  just had  a live  feed into  your  brain  so we  didn't  have to  go through  the  bullshit  of your  mouth  getting out  the words  listen to me  yes  he was  dressed  one of  them was  a little  transvestite  and not  bad looking  as a  transvestite  you're talking  about  too  wong foo  and that was  patrick  patrick sways  lee  and john  leg  of  zamo  patrick  swaysley  no not  that movie

[03:21:30]  well  you know  and that  well  i can take  an analogy  out of  anything  if you want  to take  it to the  far extreme  but the  most important  analogy is  again having  a heart  because the  bottom line  is it doesn't  matter what  your outside  presentation  is if you  have a heart  it will come  out  it's like  having a  touch screen  and then you  flip it open  and on the  inside there's  a keyboard  that's right  exactly  like the  google phone  yeah  exactly  great well  thanks a lot  thank you for  your time  i really appreciate  it  like the  google phone  so which  one do you  find  if you

[03:27:30]  here with dina on the  blackberry line dina  what's the haps  what's the what  what's the haps  oh i skipped work  to come stand in line  to grab some pieces  of paper in a booth  the american dream  i guess so what do  you do for a living  i'm a grad student  i'm actually supposed  to be student teaching  right now  educating america's  youth to have fun  how come you think  you were able to get  to the front of this  line so quickly  whereas with the  google phone  there were people  who were waiting  for like eight hours  there's like three of  them but they were  waiting for a long time  because once you go  blackberry you never 
[03:28:00]  go back and you have  to have one i think  to appreciate one  you never go blackberry  was that lisa lambanelli  but uh yeah  and then uh one more  from dina  the other phones shun you  yeah  once you go blackberry  yeah dina really bothered  me  okay  so you have to grab  all those pieces of paper  in front of everybody  oh yeah  hell yeah  it seems demeaning  it'll be fun  i feel like the people  at the google phone  would just let you  get a phone  if you wanted one 
[03:28:30]  i think you're biased  no i'm just trying  to get to the bottom  of this because  you know i've heard  such good things  about the google phone  and here they're just  making people grab  paper and stuff  the google phone  it's a game  it's more of a game  show than it is about  you know  it's just a good excuse  come out and have fun  that's it  does everybody get  a blackberry storm  no  everybody online  for the google phone  got one  i'm good  all i'm doing  when i'm listening  is just rooting for him  to say google phone again  no problem  all right  have fun 
[03:29:00]  i can't get enough  i was like please  say google phone again  google phone  google phone  does google really  have a phone  of course they do  rich  how the fuck  i don't know  how the fuck  i don't know  it's been on the news  it's just  oh my god  what is that  what is that  our new secretary  of defense  jesus fucking christ  everybody gets pancakes  there is a woman  i swear to you  and without even  trying to be racist  she is dressed  exactly like aunt jemima 
[03:29:30]  on cnbc  they took her off  oh my god  she's now gone  sorry  and some hot chick  is on there  look at all the hot broads  in the fucking news  these days  yeah i know they are  it's distracting  look at that one  wow  yeah right  god damn  what's going on  with the fucking  look at this  she's fucking hot  it's fucking charlie's angels  doing the news right there  look at this  cut three in a row  the one on the right  is stunning  look at the lips 
[03:30:00]  on the one on the right  the camera's not that low  look at the cleavage  look at her fucking mouth  that was a nice distraction  no offense  but we still think you're gay  I don't give a fuck  because I find a man  that's dressed up  as a girl  who does a good  one whoever did makeup  on the show  on the movie  was fabulous  because  fabulous  he made  the makeup  the choreography 
[03:30:30]  was fabulous  alright let's finish up  what's the haps  with john right  yeah  john  he's also wanting  a blackberry storm  of course he did  alright we're out here  with john  john what's the haps  well  we're back in here  in the city  we came back in  last thursday  at midnight  trying to win  the storm hunt  went all around  the city  in the pouring rain  he won  actually last night  in the storm hunt  so we're trying  to get me a phone  today  do you have it  no no  you gotta wait  four weeks for it 
[03:31:00]  four weeks  yeah  what kind of contest  is that  i don't know  it's a $500 phone  so i guess he can  wait four weeks  you know  i went out a couple  weeks ago  when the google phone  came out  people waited  online for that  and they gave it  to him right away  yeah  i don't know  what verizon's  doing with the  releases  but i'd rather  have a phone  that works  than one that's  all glitchy  he doesn't  you know  fucking sam  he was just  dissing the google  phone  the google phone  i wasn't done  talking to him  that's for sure  so four weeks  if you win it 
[03:31:30]  there they don't  just hand you  the fucking phone  you gotta wait  four weeks  not only that  but they did  an event  like i guess  the night before  when it was  pouring rain  and they made  people do a  scavenger hunt  around the city  to win this storm  yeah  and so they come  back all wet  from rain  and exhausted  and they're like  okay you won  in four weeks  you can have a phone  and pay us for a  two-year contract  wait they had to do  a scavenger hunt  yeah  did you guys host  that  oh i get it  from our dumb pilot 
[03:32:00]  low blow  oh really  that's a low blow  that's a low blow  that hurt  oh really  that hurt  oh jesus  videos of the week  they just showed  the drunk guy  trying to jump  on the horse  ceramic course  or whatever it is  look at that  a guy shaving  obama in his head  and now obama  and um  and george w  walking  i walked right  along there  very friendly  with secret service  right there 
[03:32:30]  george bush  walks like bigfoot  anyone else  notice that  when he made  that perp walk  with obama  yeah  it looks like  you know  that famous  bigfoot photo  video whatever  alright hey  let's meet more  of john here  yeah  are you excited  about the touch  screen on the  storm  definitely  i think uh  multimedia meets  business so  did you know  the google phone  has a touch  screen and a  keyboard  yeah i did  actually  i did  i want to try  the sure type  see what that's  about you know 
[03:33:00]  yeah because some  people say the only  way you can really  have a sure type  is with a keyboard  and a touch  screen  right i think  there's blackberry  actually has one of  those in the works  uh the google phone  is already out  yeah i know  they still have  them  they still have  in the store  you can still get  a google phone  yeah yeah i know  i'll probably check  it out later  it's right around  the corner if you  want to check it  out  okay i appreciate  it  the google phone  the google phone  he was just 
[03:33:30]  in on it and  realizing he didn't  want to be there  anymore  i think your radio  partner just arrived  who dave  dave  let's get him to do  one of his patented  shit bits  he has a great way  to promote your  show with him  he doesn't  he comes in  does a shit  bit and then  we go look  more of this  if you tune it  to sam and dave  it's perfect  no no i think  it'd be perfect  if you sat him  down and just  talked about  things and he  started telling  some jokes and  making conversation  that would be how  to promote the  show because  that's what they  can expect from  special delivery  with sam and  no shit 
[03:34:00]  special delivery  sam and dave  saturday 9pm  on xm202  sirius 197  you can make  shit turkeys  you ever make  a shit turkey  you smear it on  your hand  most kids did it  with paint but  you guys were  doing shit  we're not doing  any shit stuff  wow  you gotta be  i'm gonna take  off now that  what's the  haps is over  it's not over  oh boy  oh it's not  over  it's not over  awkward  as long as  he sits there  i gotta go to  an interview with  with uh sleep  and respiratory  magazine 
[03:34:30]  are you shitting  me  no i'm not  kidding  i'm not  kidding  tell him i  fucking subscribed  and i haven't  gotten my recent  copy  no you know  you know what  happened  they call  no i'm not  lying  there's not a  magazine called  sleep and respiratory  magazine and  they're calling my  doctor also  yeah  and uh and  and talking to  her and and  yesterday i was  supposed to do  the interview and  then i just forgot  about it and  i only fell asleep  are they at least  giving you the cover  i don't even think 
[03:35:00]  i'm making the cover  who's gonna be on  the cover  a narcoleptic  no you're not  gonna make the  cover sleep  in respiratory  magazine  i don't think  i am  it wasn't funny  it just made  sense  i was impressed  i said narcoleptic  you having trouble  with that gum man  wow  oh we got another  celebrity for you rich  who's that  all right who  is that  he was in  brokeback mountain  donnie darko  i have no idea  just give me his  first name  i might  jarhead  what's his first  name i might get  the last name  his first name is  jake  oh uh 
[03:35:30]  dylanworth or  something  something  it's got a couple  names on the end  of it right  uh  duh  dylanworth  it's like  he's got a  couple  dylanworth  this is the best  game we ever  played  i love this  game  i find another  one  steve from  bayshore  steve tell brett to 
[03:36:00]  give you a free  beer this weekend  jake  dylanworth  he's making up  actors  he's got two  names to last  here between  between the  jake dylanworth  in an all new  movie  coming this  summer  i don't know  these guys  bonnie knows  them all  i don't know  but he has two  last names  right  does he  give us  suggestions  yes  jillenhouse  jillenhall  or gillenhall  i've heard uh  two ways it  could be  pronounced so 
[03:36:30]  what is it  i've heard jake  jillenhall  i think that's  pretty accurate  oh i was yeah  i was close  dylanworth  dylanworth  dylanworth is uh  yeah it's not  it's not in the  ballpark  no  you just had one  syllable correct  and it was the  middle one  why don't we do  the last clip  from john  trying to get  the blackbird  store  so are you  worried about  the uh  two-year contract  and paying for  it and everything  after you win  this phone  no because if 
[03:37:00]  you win it  it's unlocked  and i can use  it on t-mobile  well yeah but  if you're gonna  get a t-mobile  phone you probably  just get the  google phone right  no  why  because i'm a  blackberry fan  not a google  fan  good luck with  that  do you think  that uh  the google phone  has the ability  to be the  blackberry killer  because that's  what a lot of  people are saying  you don't agree  no  all right cool  well thanks a lot  i appreciate the  uh interview  me too 
[03:37:30]  talk to you later  thank god  sam just keeping  him on the hook  that guy was the  closest that anyone's  ever come to hitting  me i think  oh really  he really was not  happy  why was he so mad  at the google phone  i don't know i'm just  trying to find out about  phones  you should have dave go  mad on these um  interviews  he could throw shit  no why would he do that  because he works with shit  no he'd come up with  some funny interesting  questions or some  kind of funny angle  sam is like what  would happen if like 
[03:38:00]  the show 2020 had  like a 12 year old  reporter  like as a novelty  a 12 year old  yeah  questions that don't go  anywhere  what about the google  phone  the google  but what about the  google phone  and we're like it's so  adorable  isn't it cute  it's so young and stupid  yeah  we should make him like  do like wacky human  interest stories in new  york  yeah  like like charles osgood
