<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a chaotic incident involving a drum kit.  The hosts set up a drum kit in an elevator, with Sal, a staff member, performing a drum solo that resulted in a confrontation with building security and a SiriusXM employee. This escalated into a larger argument in the lobby, ending with a damaged drum and the hosts being directed to a secret freight elevator.  Surprisingly, the head of security turned out to be a fan. The hosts then discussed their frustration with certain building staff, attributing some of the resentment to the SiriusXM split.  This transitioned into a discussion of a negative experience at Morimoto restaurant in Philadelphia, where they were refused service despite the restaurant being nearly empty, in stark contrast to their positive experience at the nearby Budokan.  Anecdotes about past incidents and past firings from the show were also recounted.

The show then moved onto a discussion about unpleasant odors from costumed characters at a Philadelphia event, particularly the Philly Phanatic, and a near-miss with a low-flying plane near Newark Airport.  This led back to the Morimoto debacle and the hosts' complaints about the staff.  The upcoming guest, Moses Gates, author of "Hidden Cities," was introduced.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and reviewing audio clips from Denny's "Worst of the Week" segment, focusing on the vocal performance of the contributors.  The hosts also contrasted Jay Morris's podcast style with his on-air persona, discussed Phil Hendry's podcast, Jim Carrey's anti-gun song "Cold Dead Hand" (including a satirical Charlton Heston introduction), and the Amazing Race's apology for using a Vietnam War memorial as a backdrop.  The ethical implications of an NBC Today Show interview with Jerry Sandusky were debated, spurred on by a listener call. The planned in-studio drum solo by Sal and the "Friday Initiative" involving Tuna Sushi Pizza were mentioned.  Off-topic banter included discussions about the studio soundboard, the hosts' eating habits (specifically cheesesteaks and spare ribs), and various listener calls.

Further discussion of the frustrating Morimoto experience was followed by a bizarre bathroom incident shared by Anthony Cumia on Twitter.  This segued into a debate on gun control, sparked by Michael Moore's claim that 90% of gun owners are white suburbanites. Opie and Anthony challenged this statistic and reacted to comments from Michael Bloomberg and Jim Carrey on the issue. Sal's live drum performance of Rush songs ("Spirit of Radio," "Tom Sawyer," and an attempted "YYZ") was plagued by technical difficulties.  Moses Gates then joined the show.

With Gates in studio, the show focused on his urban exploration experiences as detailed in "Hidden Cities."  He recounted explorations of abandoned NYC subway tunnels (including a woman living there with numerous cats and narrowly avoiding Amtrak trains), the Chrysler Building (sitting atop one of the eagles on the 61st floor), and various other locations in France (climbing Notre Dame and subsequent arrest), Russia (exploring tunnels under Red Square and a near-arrest), and Egypt (climbing pyramids). He discussed the urban exploration community, the sharing of information, and increasing restrictions on access to various locations.  His near-arrest in Russia and casual account of sitting atop a Chrysler Building eagle were highlighted.

The show later shifted to discussions about food preferences (a dislike for sushi and a love for meatball parmesan sandwiches), a critique of Opie's restaurant reviews, and listener calls, including Bobby the Champ’s recommendations and Mongo the Trucker mentioning his YouTube channel.  Eric's grooming habits and a Dollar Shave Club advertisement were also featured.  Further listener calls critiqued Denny Falcone's "Worst of the Week" performance, with clips of his radio lessons being played.  One caller mistook E-Rock's voice for a commercial.  Multiple listeners commented on Eric's appearance.  A caller mentioned seeing Moses' Chrysler Building climbing video, leading to a discussion of Russian daredevils climbing skyscrapers.  James Lipton's previous in-studio appearance and Opie's habit of spoiling upcoming segments were mentioned.  A review of the movie "This Is 40" followed, alongside further listener calls, including prank calls attempting to say "Slavo." Sam's enjoyment of "Les Misérables" and its box office success were discussed.  The show concluded with mentions of upcoming guests, including Shane from Vice.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio  Antonio  Good morning  Good morning  Good morning  I did the old  I did the old two more minutes  Like I'll just lay here for like two minutes 
[00:00:30]  Yeah  In bed  And then  How did that work out?  Ten minutes went by  It's like  My eyes flew open  I'm like  And then the whole drive in  I'm just  Whizzing around people  You just can't do that  No  You need that alarm discipline  Yeah  Yeah  Mother  Yeah motherfucker  I'm still annoyed by Friday  I know I went  I know I went over 
[00:01:00]  With the after show  But  Oh I heard that  I don't know  I want to know  Who the fuck that guy is  Why is it  Are you scared to say  Who the guy is?  I'm not scared  I mean I don't know  Oh  Sam Roberts scaredy cat  Yeah  Do you want me to just announce his name?  No  Because it's not going to mean anything  To anybody  Yeah  But what does he do around here?  He controls all the studios  And all the equipment  Like if we need to do a fishbowl broadcast  Right  We need to go through him to say  Well we need three tables 
[00:01:30]  And we need connections for the 360s  Well I guess we could start by  The end of Friday's show  We obviously set up Sal badly  And he was the only one that didn't see it coming  Oh why would he?  Even the listeners saw it coming  Even the casual listeners saw it coming  The hardcore certainly saw it coming  Yeah  And we set up Sal to play the drums all morning long  At first I wanted to hear him play the drums  Of course  But then when he didn't take the initiative  And it took forever for him to finally realize that 
[00:02:00]  Yeah maybe  Maybe I should be playing the drums for Opie and Anthony  Yeah  Get a drum kit in here  Yeah  Then me and you kind of went for the turn  It was so obvious  Well at this point  Oh yeah  He's not going to be playing the drums anytime soon  So the show ends with him  With his stupid drumsticks going click click click  Like drummers do just before they  Right before they rock  Get into it  And then boom  Show's over  And it's always amazing  That you do get a couple dummies out there  Go  Like they don't understand 
[00:02:30]  They're like  They cut you off  Just when he was about to play the drums  No one seriously said that  I swear I got a couple  I got a couple  It's a very very small percentage  At this point  But you do get a couple  Like they cut you off  What happened?  Don't  So then after the show  We decided that  You know  Sal needs to play the drums  In the elevators  It's logical right?  Why not?  Got that dumb  Stupid  Silly elevator show 
[00:03:00]  So I'm like  Fuck it  Let's do this  Door flies open  And a fucking drum solo  Is going on  Well we packed up the whole drum kit  Put it in the elevator  The first problem was that  There was no room for anybody else really  Oh really?  And then we went  We went down  And a couple  Elevator doors open  You see people just  Running away from the elevators  Oh  I found out later that  Because of the elevator shaft  When he was playing in there  Which he was  That it was so loud  And echoey 
[00:03:30]  Throughout the whole building  It was just flying out the elevated doors  I guess  They said  Huh?  Everybody around here was talking about it after you left  Like  Everybody who works here heard it  Because I guess it just echoes through the shaft  The elevator shaft  And then  Like people up on 37  Were sitting at their cubicles  And they just heard like  This huge booming sound of drums  Echoing through the building  And there was a radio show that thought  There might have been an earthquake  And I think  I think it might have been us with the drums 
[00:04:00]  I'm serious  Really?  Yeah  So then  Nice  I told Troy  I'm like  Troy  You know  This is going to be a problem  If we go all the way down  And his intentions were  Not to go all the way down to the bottom  Yeah  But somehow  We made it all the way down to the bottom  Yeah  Yeah  So the doors open  And Sal's in full playing drums mode  Because we're trying to get some footage  And the first thing I see  Is two elevator banks out  They're working on two elevators  And one of the elevator guys 
[00:04:30]  Just starts yelling at me  He's like  You can't be doing that today  We're out two elevators  He's losing his mind  And then that of course  Got the attention of the security guy  Oh the crack security staff here  And then the security guy comes over  He's like  You can't do this  I'm like  Alright  We'll go back upstairs  We'll go back  No problem  We'll go back upstairs  We understand  Okay  And he let us go  He let us go  So we go back upstairs  So then I'm figuring  We're in the elevator bank  So I'm like  We can go down a few floors still 
[00:05:00]  Yeah  As long as we stay high in the building  They're way down below  So  People do push that button  Right  So logically  We knew we had until about floor 26  But after that  It goes right to the bottom  I guess  So  All of a sudden  Troy goes  Oh my god  We're going back down  Something happened  I'm like  You're kidding me  We're so in trouble  Those doors open  In the lobby  Now there's four  Security guys  Waiting 
[00:05:30]  Four  Just yelling at us  Yelling at us  And then some douche  From here  Is down there  And he looks right at us  And I  I was almost amazed  That he was talking to me  He goes  On what planet  Do you think this was a good idea  The planet  I haven't fun  The planet  The radio show  Right of course  Internet  And fucking  Yeah  Of course  Anything but just playing music  On a station  Fun planet  Exactly  And who are we hurting  In the end  Can you explain that  Yes 
[00:06:00]  Can you explain who  We're really hurting  In the end  What's the big  Problem that would happen  If you were left  To continue this  He was so mad  Like we were taking  The drum set  And maybe smashing it  Right  I don't know  I don't know  I don't understand  How some of these  People's brains  Are wired  He's so mad  And all it is  Is a bunch of drums  That lay in that hallway  You've seen the drums  A million times  And we set them up  Nice in the elevator  And we played them  What's the big 
[00:06:30]  Fucking deal  Yeah  What's the big  And why are you involved  Yeah  And by the way  No one from this place  Started talking to me  About it since Friday  So relax  Whoever that douche is  So  They start pulling us  Out of the elevator  And the one guy  I'm like  Alright we'll go back up  We'll go back up  That old gag  It worked the first time  He just said that  And the second time  It didn't work  And one of these  Security guys  Got very aggressive  And he goes no  And he pulls one of the drums  And he kind of  Sort of tosses 
[00:07:00]  But places it  Flings it a little  And it falls on its side  I'm like  Oh you just broke  One of our drums  You're gonna have to pay for that  I twisted it  Because now he's all panicky  Like he might actually have to  Because in the end  He knew it wasn't a problem  It was no big deal  It's just a bunch of dopes  In an elevator  Playing drums  Who cares  But then of course  The SiriusXM guy  Just scolding all of us  Once again  Follow me  I'm like  I'm not following you  Follow me  I'm an adult  I'm a father  I got two kids at home 
[00:07:30]  I'm not following you  Follow me  But then the other  Security guys go  We're not letting you up  The regular elevator  You're gonna have to take  The freight elevator  How are the acoustics?  Beautiful  Actually that was set  That was set in there  Was it?  So then  Then they  I know I went  Over all this  On the after show  But it's worth repeating  So then all of a sudden  There's like a magic door  In the lobby  There's a magic door  Yeah  They did something  And all of a sudden  This wall moves 
[00:08:00]  Whoa  And we're now  We go through a magic door  Like Batman  Batcave  And then I'm looking  At this wall  Like how  What?  Like you would never  Think there's a  Like some weird door there  And then next thing you know  We're in a  Bank of freight elevators  It was two or three  I think  At least two  And the guy's still  Like once again  He's like  He's giving us all looks  And he's like  Pissy  And he's like  The guy from up here?  Yes  Ew  Just pissy  And then we're loading  The drums 
[00:08:30]  Onto the freight elevator  Troy  Jump in if you  If you think  I'm exaggerating  No you're 100% on  Yeah  And he was so  Fucking pissed  What was he pissed at?  I don't know  We came back up here  When we dropped  Everything off  He's just like  Why would you take  Drums out in  20 degree weather?  I said  The elevator's not  20 degrees  What are we talking about?  Talking about  Where were the drums  Going to go?  Exactly  What is he talking about?  He's just one of those  Guys that just  You know  He has a little bit  Of authority  If we were bringing 
[00:09:00]  The drums downstairs  Via the elevator  Like that was the mechanism  Yeah  We wouldn't be playing them  Yeah  The whole point  Was to put him  In the elevator  Of course  Yeah  And we're a dopey  Fucking company  Like we're  A whole bunch of us  Are very immature  And do dopey things  To try to entertain  Some people out there  That guy doesn't know  Anything about that  Part of the radio  Everything has to be  Straight edge  With this fucking guy  Don't think out of the box  So then he is  Like the security guards 
[00:09:30]  You can tell  Like they're  Kind of aggressive  Because their jobs  Are on the line  But they're kind of  Being cool  And this guy  From here  Is just being  Pissy  On what planet  Did you think  This was a good idea  I'm like really?  He just keeps trying  To scold us  As we're walking  And did you hear  The part where he goes  Follow me  I'm like I'm not  Following you  I'm a middle aged man  Were you going  To the office?  Right  Were you being  Taken to the office?  So then we're loading  The freight elevator  And the guys  Are sort of being cool  And then all of a sudden 
[00:10:00]  The walkie talkie goes up  The supervisor  Wants to talk  Oh no  Supervisor they say  He was the head guy  The head guy  Wants to talk to you  For security?  Yeah  So the other security guards  Are like oh man  You know  Because they're like  It's going to that next level  And then I kind of  Took a peek  At Sirius XM guy  Douchebag  And he's giving me  A look like  You're finally in trouble  I've been waiting  For this day  I hate this guy already  I've been waiting  For this day  You can tell  He wanted to just  Rub his hands together 
[00:10:30]  Like I finally got you  I know you've been  A problem around here  Bitching and complaining  For years  And finally  What a little  Tattletale  Troy knows  Yeah  He's just  He's a miserable guy  It really is  There are a lot of people  Up here who don't  Have any real power  Yeah  And so like  When they find an opportunity  To reprimand  Somebody  Especially if it's  Somebody like you  Right  They go  Oh I get to flex  My muscle  That I don't have  And we're in this area  And I don't even  Look at Troy  Because I know  He gets it  And he's cool  And he knows  In the end  We're fine 
[00:11:00]  Yeah  But there's  Little Sal  Shaking like  A motherfucker  Oh was he  The newbie  Is shaking  And I'm like  You know what  In this situation  I kind of got to  Let him off the hook  A little bit  So I just give him  A wink  Like I got this  I got this  Yeah relax  I'm starting to  Fast forward in my head  At the very worst  I'm going to have to  Sit down with Greenstein  And explain myself  So I know I got this  Because Sal is losing it  And then his eyes  Get really big  And he's like  Oh I'm about to  See something I think  He probably figured  He's another one of these  Low men on the totem pole  That's going to be 
[00:11:30]  Left in our fucking wake  Right  Like so many  That he's read about  Over the years  And then  The Sirius XM douche  The elevator's open  He's like  Come on  And he's like  He's like supervising  The loading of the drums  Into the freight elevator  I'm just like  Ugh  They're not even his drum  Like like  It's like  Gives a shit  And if you broke the drums  I mean all you gotta do  Is they go to the show  And they look  The drums broke  You know it's not his responsibility  I had to write a check  Right  You know cause I know  It's my responsibility  You know I know  It would be my fault 
[00:12:00]  At that point  Wow  So then the secret door opens  And here comes  The main guy  With a walkie talkie  And I'm like  Okay here we go  He looks at me  And this is  I know  You might have heard it  On the after show  But for the people that did  He looks right at me  He goes  First of all  And I'm like  It got me a little bit  It got me  He goes  First of all  I'm a big fan  And reaches his hand out  To shake my hand  Dude  I turned like this  To the SiriusXM douche guy  And went  Not this time buddy  Not this time 
[00:12:30]  He was just like  Ah  Nice  Not this time  Oh my god  First of all  I'm a big fan  And then I  You know  I was cool  I'm like  You know  We were trying to do a thing  And we fucked up  And went all the way down  To the lobby  I'm sorry  I see you have elevator  I was totally  Mr. Cool guy  Like you know  Trying to respect his job  I'm like  What was Douchebag doing  He was so mad  He's like  I'm a big fan of you guys  But you can't really be doing this  I'm like  Yeah I know  We were trying something  I see you have elevator banks out  Which makes it worse today  I get it 
[00:13:00]  I'm sorry  Yeah  And then everyone starts joking  They're like  Well the acoustics on this elevator  Are pretty good  Because it's a big freight elevator  Yeah yeah  And then we go upstairs  And the guy from here  Is frothing  He's so mad  He doesn't know what to do  Because he can't  He can't pull out  Any of his douchey phrases anymore  Yeah  And then you walked into the studio  Well no  I just  I marched right past the guy  He's like  He's like  I had one of the drums  He's like  Oh let's just put the drums here  He's just so annoyed and mad  He doesn't know who to yell at 
[00:13:30]  So I'm starting to help him  Move the drums aside  Oh I didn't hear this part  Oh yeah  And he's just still yelling at us  At you guys  He's just reprimanding us  Just about  What do you think you're doing  And why would you do this  And it's 20 degree weather out there  And I'm playing outside  I've gotten into screaming matches  With this guy before  Kenny can tell you  I got into a huge yelling match  With this guy before  A couple months ago  Right  And I was just like  You know what  I'm just going to let this one slide  I don't feel like getting into it  With this guy today  Right  But yeah he's just  He's a miserable dude  That just likes to flex his power  He saw an opportunity 
[00:14:00]  Who is he?  He's exactly  Is he the guy we had to ask for  For the  Ask for the drums?  He's the guy that's in charge of the drums  I don't think he got them for us  He has people under him  That  I think Mars just went and got the drums himself  Yeah  He said I can do this  Mars is motivated  We knew we needed drums  He knew what drums were in the building  And believe me  For the most part  If things are just laying around the building  It's fair game for this show  You can absolutely just grab it  Have fun  We're not going to bust it apart 
[00:14:30]  With a fucking hatchet or anything  God forbid something happens  We'll take the responsibility  And we take care of it  We turned this long hallway  Into a bowling alley one morning  Right  Just to try to make it fun around here  Just something fun  But there's people  That honestly just want this  To be like a fucking  Like a corporation office  Right  Like Morgan Stanley  Yeah  We're not Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley  We're a bunch of goofballs  That never grew up  The product is behind the glass  And never shall the product  Leak out into the hallways  Or anything  Look  Fuck you  Yeah 
[00:15:00]  The idea was a little crazy  I'll be honest  But  It sounds fun  We had it kind of under control  Until you fucking  Fucking messed us up  And got us down in the lobby again  When he said do  We're going back down  It's not like you can hide  What you're doing  Cause like  Nah  Other shit we've done in the elevator  Is like  Oh fuck  You run across people in the elevator  That don't want any part of it  So you go  Alright no problem  You turn off the camera  And you just hide it  Like look I'm done  But you can't hide a whole drum set  And Troy goes  Oh shit  We're going all the way back down  Oh that's just a nightmare 
[00:15:30]  Where you're like  Uh oh  And the doors open  And they're just  They're just staring at us  Like really  And I thought to take the part  The drums apart  While we were heading back down  So it looks like  Oh we're cleaning up  But somehow  We just magically came back  You did give it a couple trips  You did give it a try  But I mean  There were so many drums  It took up pretty much  The whole elevator  And I didn't realize  That while we were coming back down  Or still playing  Right  The drums were playing  That they could hear it all  Throughout the entire building  The guys that stayed on the floor  Said you know  The doors closed  And we were gone 
[00:16:00]  And they could hear us  Way the fuck down  Way the fuck down  That was great  Yeah  Sal can play  He can play the drums  Yeah he's a good drummer  So I just want  Oh there's some pictures  From  Yeah look at that  It's on Roland's Instagram  Roland's Instagram  You want a little catty corner  In the elevator I see  It's nice  Well we were trying to  Set up in the corner  So people could come in  And enjoy some drumming  As they were on their floor  But uh  Just trying to help  The people out  And that's not even  Their good drum set  They have a better drum set  Than that  Those are just  Miscellaneous pieces of drums 
[00:16:30]  Yeah  But that guy  I'm like who are  What are you doing  Who cares  Yeah  You're not my boss  You're none of these guys boss  No  Yeah but that's the thing  He's nobody's boss  And so when he has the opportunity  To reprimand somebody  Or get somebody in trouble  Oh he's gonna take it  That's his power  And you know he talked to somebody  And it was Friday  So I'm wondering if some shit  Will go down today  A little shit  Nah I mean I think  We all got  The security guy  The guy who's in charge of security  Up here came around  Talking to all of us  Just to get the story  Of what happened  I didn't like  I don't think anybody  Probably gotta make out a report 
[00:17:00]  I'm sure  A report  Any of us got  I didn't get reprimanded  I don't think anybody  Got reprimanded  In the end  In the end  I mean like what did it hurt  Yeah in the end  Who cares  There's nothing broken  That's what we're playing  Who cares  Yeah it's a Friday  And somebody played the drums  In the elevator  Who cares  It was just one of those things  Where they go  Hey man you can't  You can't take the drum set  In the elevator  Come on  Yeah  Okay yeah  And that's what I said  Like yeah I guess you're right  You know we thought  We had an idea  And I guess  Yeah you don't go  Fuck you  I'm taking the drums

[00:19:00]  After  I don't know  Sometime after 11 o'clock  After dealing with all this shit  I'm walking out  And he's there  So I'm like  Oh fuck  It's just me and him now  Yeah  All the spotlights are off  And now it's just me and him  I'm like  Shit  And he comes aggressively up to me  I'm like  Here we go  He goes  Dude I just want to let you know  Man I'm just doing my job  I don't give a crap whatsoever  But you know  I got bosses and stuff  And you know  So did the trustees  At the concentration camp  They were just doing their job too 
[00:19:30]  But he was cool  He came up to me  To basically apologize  Like look  If I was a little aggressive  It's because my supervisor  Was right there  And you put me in a weird spot  But in the end  I don't care  I'm a fan  You know  I thought it was  He goes  I thought it was funny  To be honest with you  I'm like  Alright no worries  Have a good weekend  So  Yeah  It was fun  So in the end  The only one was the guy from here  Like thinking  I guess we're going outside with drums  Even if we did that  Who cares  That would have been fine  Yeah  What would have happened  Nothing  Yeah

[00:22:00]  Big fan  Big fan  The timing on that  Was beautiful  Yeah  Because he got me  He goes first of all  I'm like oh shit  Here we go  I'm a big fan  I just turned  As I'm shaking  His hand  What a tool  Where does that tool  You've seen him  A million times  I've never seen him  Smile  And he just kind of  Where does he  Out of stairs  Oh he's an upstairs guy  Yeah  I don't think he likes us  I had to come down  Don't make me  Come down there  He sort of was nice 
[00:22:30]  And nice to me  When I  I sat in the booth  As he was mixing  MGMT  One day  A year and a half ago  At this point  Probably  Maybe even two years ago  He was alright that day  But that was the only time  I ever really  Had any kind of contact  With him  Until the  Finger pointing  And the follow me  And the  Fuck him  What plan  Did you think  This was a good idea  He must have loved  Being able to  He was looking at all of us  Like he wanted an answer  From all of us  I'm like you're not  Getting an answer from me  And I know you're not  Getting an answer from Troy  And I know Sal  Will probably panic 
[00:23:00]  And go and say  I'm sorry sir  A few times  You ain't getting shit  From me and Troy  I knew you weren't  Going to say shit  And fucking  Be a little puss boy  About it  That guy  I mean  Like I said  I've gotten  Screening matches  With him  Over what  Well the last time  Was  Let me think  What it was  Somebody  He had tore apart  My entire studio  And I come into work  On a Monday  And everything's  Completely  Completely demolished  And I said  I'm like  What are you doing  I work for this show  We're going to be on the air 
[00:23:30]  I need a producer  And he's like  Well there's other shows  That are more important  Than this  And it's not on my  Priority list  And now it's just like  And then it's just like  The chain of command  Where I have to go to my boss  You said there are more shows  More important than this  Yeah  And so I went to  I went to my  I have to go to my bosses  That have to go to  Their bosses  That have to go to  His boss  It's just like this  Why did he tear apart  Your studio  He needed it for something else  He was trying to fix something  Or trying to do something  And it was torn apart  Most of the people  Right here don't really  You know  It's just weird  The layers of people 
[00:24:00]  That you have to go through  For  To reprimand him  To get him to do his job  It's just  I don't know why  We're so hated around here  Is it because we  You know  Speak our minds  Maybe because sometimes  We've turned a bunch of people around  Absolutely  But there's definitely  A lot of people  That still fucking hate  Us on the show  People that work here  A lot of people that work here  Don't understand what it is  They don't understand  That the product  Isn't a fucking widget  It's not some kind of fucking  You know  Something that's sold  At Macy's  Right  It doesn't fit into a mold  Yeah 
[00:24:30]  It's a fucking  You know  It's radio shows  Going on in this place  And sometimes it means  Getting a drum set  And going into an elevator  Right  I think a lot of it  Is still this  Old layover  From the Sirius XM separation  Because there are a lot of people  Probably some resentment  Who actually started  Listening to the show  And they love  That you guys  Shit on management  All the time  Because everybody around here  Wishes they could do that  Right  You know what I mean  There are a lot of people  Who love that  But then I think  There are a lot of people  Who don't like  That you know  You came from XM  And you guys 
[00:25:00]  Are all of a sudden  You just walk into this building  And you get to be the big dogs  And they've been here  Slaving away  Like that idiot  I don't know any of their names  I don't know  But most of them do  I have no idea  What that guy does  I've seen him  And I couldn't name  I couldn't name  Five radio shows here  Right  That would be the point  Except for the big  Celebrity type ones  But regular radio shows  I couldn't name them  I have no idea  I see sports guys  Walk around  I don't even know  I don't even know  Where their studio is  But you guys  And I don't know  Their big dogs  Yeah when you guys  Won something too 
[00:25:30]  I mean people have to jump  Right  You didn't have to come in here  And kiss the ring  And that gets people upset  You know what I mean  Because it's like  Why that means  We're doing our jobs  That means we're bringing  In subscribers  Well they  I mean that guy  Doesn't look at it like that  Of course he doesn't  Oh he thought he had me  I laughed at that  Off and on all weekend  I just started thinking about it  He brings in listeners  With you know  Tweaking those knobs  I'm sure his job  Is important on some level  But  But leave  You know  Stay out of our fucking way  You have nothing to do  With what we do  And what our guys do 
[00:26:00]  Don't try to  Reprimand anybody  In here  That's silly  It is right  It's not going to get you  Anywhere really  I didn't get  I didn't get one email  Or one phone call about it  So why is he trying to get  You know  Into my face about it  Yeah nobody really said  Anything to me afterwards  So  No  No because it's ridiculous  And everybody's fine with it  Except for the guy  That thinks he's  Mr.  In charge of drums guy  Right  Sal got a talking to  Sal  Talking to  He didn't  No  Why would Sal come in here

[00:44:00]  And it's the closest point  To Cuba  I go  Right now  There's no one  More south than me  In the United States  Of America  That's pretty cool  I like that  Yeah  It's cool right  Right  You get your little moment  Anyway  So she looks down  At her computer  And I'm thinking  All right look  She's going to say 520  It looks like there's  Even still setting up tables  But the place is officially open  So she goes  The first reservation  Is 1030 tonight  What?  And I look  Over her shoulder  And I'm still trying 
[00:44:30]  To be cool  And I go  I go  What?  You got invisible people  In here right now?  Ah  Like just making  Light of it  And  There wasn't one  Table that was being taken  Yeah  One table  And it was like  People rushing in  Because 5 o'clock hit  Like it was obvious  No one was walking in there  You know  You were going to have  Some stragglers  It wasn't going to fill up  In the time that it would  Have taken you guys  Thank you  Thank you  It's like  Take a table  Thank you  And then as people come in 
[00:45:00]  You fill up the place  But by the time  You know  Yeah we need  You're already gone  We need an hour maybe  So  Right  Right  What  At 5  5.30  6 o'clock  The place was going to be packed  I don't think so  I go  So  What  You got invisible people in here right now  Or customers  Oh boy  It's not a smile  Nothing  She just looks at me  First reservation  Is 10.30  So I bite  My  I like saying this  Because I've seen Jimmy do it  I started biting my own teeth  It's that like  You know  You're like  Opie 
[00:45:30]  Sushi diva  And then I turn around  And I  It was loud enough  Where people could hear  I go  Get me out of here  Before I fucking hit somebody  Oh shit  I was so fucking mad  So what was that about  We weren't dressed properly  You think  Or they want to be the hot restaurant  Where they could tell people  Yeah yeah yeah  They want to tell people like  We are too hot to serve you right now  Obviously  Look at this place  They don't bend the rules there  That's a reservation  And you're fucked  Dude  That is stupid  You see the picture 
[00:46:00]  That's exactly what I saw  You see this picture of an empty restaurant  Because they just opened  That's exactly what I saw  It would be impossible  To seat everybody  There would have had to have been  A line outside  Of all the people waiting  To come in  Exactly  For a five o'clock reservation  Exactly  Exactly  Oh that's fucking ridiculous  So Morimoto  I know they're big in Philly  And I know they own  A bunch of joints man  You know  Your people certainly  Did not even treat us  Like human beings  Because there is a better way  To say that  Yeah  Like even explain 
[00:46:30]  Like well I know  The restaurant  Looks  Is  They should have said  Is empty  But this is how it works  Yeah yeah  These people are going to be  Piling in at 530  And you're going to be  Kind of taking up  Somebody's table  At that point  Yeah say something  Something  Anything  And then I kind of  Was like joking  Slightly about it  All right  So then  We do the same thing  With Budokan  Down the street  Yeah  Budokan's a really nice  Place as well  Serves you know  Sushi dishes  I'm not sure  If they serve sushi 
[00:47:00]  Sushi  But kind of like  You know  Seer tuna  And all that crap  Yeah  And we did the same thing  We call  We actually called them up  Like hey man  I know we don't have  A reservation  But you know  We got six  And we're right around  The corner  Like come on in  Look at that  Come on in  They knew the score  And they couldn't  Have been nicer  They fit us in  And they were great to us  Absolutely great to us  Morimoto  And Budokan  Has a pretty good reputation  We have a Budokan  Here in New York  That does really well  They do really well  In Philly 
[00:47:30]  And they couldn't  Have been nicer  You know what Morimoto  It's probably owned  By the same guy  You know what Morimoto  Means in Japanese  Say it  It means scumbag  Scumbag  I knew it  That's what I'm hearing  I fucking knew it  It means fucking scumbag  I should have known  Ahead of time  I should have known  Ahead of time  So thank you  To the people  At Budokan  That were  The complete opposites  Of the people  At Morimoto  Yeah  You know I get it  I get it  If you couldn't  There was  You could have been  Way nicer about what  You know about it  Than you were  Morimoto 
[00:48:00]  You are not  Having dinner  But probably Morimoto  Would look down  At Budokan  Like oh  That place  Really  We had an excellent  Meal there  And I want to  Thank the people  And they  You know  And people were  Coming in  You know  They were coming in  But they knew  That we'd be able  To squeeze our  Dinner in  Before it got  Too crazy  Yeah  So  Well  Good for Budokan  Yeah  That Liberty Bell  Is pretty impressive  Nice big glass window 
[00:48:30]  You could walk  Right by it  I remember seeing  That thing years ago  I think that's  The first time  I officially saw it  Even though YSP  Was across the street  Back in the day  It's still cracked  Yeah  It's still cracked  You would think  They would have  Fixed that shit  Yeah  Come on  I don't know  What they're waiting for  It's a national treasure  It should fix the fucking thing  And then there was  A walking tour  Which I've never done  I think I want to do that  There's some cool  Buildings down over there  Is it the guy  Dressed like  Fucking Ben Franklin  No  I didn't see him  This time around  Remember stinky Ben Franklin  Yeah 
[00:49:00]  Everyone in Philly  Apparently smells  When they're in costume  They never wash  Their costumes  Because of those  Where do you wash  Costumes like that  I know  Where the fuck  The Philly Fanatic  I don't know how  You wash that thing  Philly Fanatic  Smelt like  An old wet dog  With  It was so bad  With human B.O.  Yeah  Yeah  It was horrendous  How bad he smelled  Really bad  And then Ben Franklin  He was a sweaty mess  He was a big sweaty fat man  And he didn't need the wig  No  He had the  He had the 
[00:49:30]  He had the skullet going  Yeah  He had the legit Ben Franklin hair going  I guess down there  They signed the constitution  Is that true  Oh yeah  Constitution halls right there  In Philly  Yeah  Yeah  But then people weren't sure  That I was with  Because I was going to start  Instagramming  Oh  But  Well you know what  The people on Twitter  Or Instagram  They'll let you know  If you're wrong  No  Yeah they sure will  They'll very pleasantly  Let you know  If you're in error  On anything  Whether it's a spelling error  Or grammar  Yeah  Yeah stuff like that 
[00:50:00]  Sure  They'll let you know  They're very helpful  And then  And then I saw this  This is pretty cool  Look how fucking  Oh man  Wow that's cool  Is it  Fucking plane flying  Right over a highway  I can  I can get my camera  Phone working  But I got half the plane  This plane  Landing at Newark airport  Every once in a while  They change  The way they land  The flight pattern  Whatever  When it's  You know 
[00:50:30]  The wind is  Coming from a different  Certain direction  And it goes right across  The New Jersey turnpike  This is rare  Pretty wild  Because I go down  To Philly a lot  I don't see them  Coming across the highway  Usually  Yeah it's usually  North and south  I got a picture  Of a plane  I'm telling you man  If it's  More than  20  I don't think it's  More than 20 feet  Above my fucking car  A huge fucking  747  Right in front of our car  It looks like  It's just about  Touching the  The light  Poles  That's a big fucking 
[00:51:00]  I'll throw out  On Instagram  That's pretty close  I was praying  I would get the whole  Fucking plane  Right in front of us  But I couldn't get my  You got to be quick  On the draw  No I know  Quick on the draw  For that one  I know  I know  I'm waiting for an apology  From Morty Moto  Do you think we'll get it  After the break  No  No  Well that's the sad part  They don't give a fuck  They do big business  So they don't give a fuck  They don't care  No they don't have to  Cater to the individual  Diner  They  Do a 
[00:51:30]  Quantity business there  Right  They just care about  Their big name  Oh big fancy name  There  More Moto  But an empty  Fucking restaurant  Empty  Yeah  I think there was one  I think there was  Two people  Kind of sitting down  On the side a little bit  Some people don't know  How like the drum guy here  They don't know how to  Just bend the rules  When it won't do  Any  It won't affect anything  Won't put anyone out  Right  If you just bend  The rules a little  That woman  Looked at her little sheet  She saw 5pm  Reservations 
[00:52:00]  Where's the opening  10 fucking  Whatever it was  And can't say to herself  Well you know what  All the people  Never come in  All at once  At five  So you sit these guys  Down  Do you think they had  Full reservations  For five o'clock  That's  Probably not  Probably not  Probably not  But probably starting  At six  I would assume  A place like that  Is going to be  You know  Yeah  Pretty packed  But by then  We're finishing up  Yeah  If she would have  Had a conversation  With me  I would have told her 
[00:52:30]  Look just so you know  We have to make  This kind of fast  I gotta get back  To kids  Yeah  We weren't gonna do  A two three hour  Let's hang out  Type of dinner  That you know  You could do  Certainly from time to time  Yeah yeah yeah  It was gonna be a quick  Let's get this done  We gotta get out of here  But I didn't even  I wasn't allowed  That luxury  She wouldn't talk  Just was all business  Looking at her stupid sheet  And they love saying that  You know  First reservation  Is 10 30  Which is kind of  A dick move to say  Because what 
[00:53:00]  We're gonna come back  In five and a half hours  We're here now  Five and a half hours  So you know  Like you know  You should pretty much  Say sorry  You should have said  Sorry but the first  Reservation is 10 30  Not a sorry nothing  First reservation is  10 30  I should have said  Alright we'll wait  Where's your bar  And then just get  Fucking hammered  And be an obnoxious  Asshole for five straight hours  Where's that fucking table  You bitch  So that was it  Another Philly trip  In the books  It was good  How often do you go down there  Is it every other weekend about 
[00:53:30]  We're going back down  This weekend for Easter probably  Ah the Easter thing  No we'll go  We'll go a month or two  Without going at all  And then we'll  Pop a few in a row  So it probably  Average averages out  To once a month maybe  Yeah  On average probably  Why would somebody  Be able to  Squeeze him behind me  In this studio  I gotta fucking  I kinda  I'm kinda digging  The just kinda laying back thing  Right  You can't do that for too long  Not in this studio  Well we're in the talk stage 
[00:54:00]  Of doing something  With the console  Oh  We gotta add that  To the talk stage  We are talking  We love the talk stage  Cause we always move on  To the next thing  Now that we learn  That the wall's gonna cost  A half a million dollars  To remove  I said  Well at the very least  We redesigned this place  A little bit  Gives ourselves  A little more room  I said  I brought up the fact  This giant fucking  Soundboard in front of me  I don't need  And you said  You wanted to  You know  To have more room  Over there  Oh do I want more room  But we're in the talk stage  I said this piece of furniture 
[00:54:30]  Is just way too big for us  We don't need all this  They love a good big console  Here at SiriusXM  Don't they  They love a big console  With a lot of shit on it  Right  And then they get the  They get the worst color  Possible  Because you know  This color's not serving  Not selling  Excuse me  So you know  They got a good fucking  Bargain on it  No this is not  In anyone's kitchen  Oh this is the worst  I don't  What is it  Coriander  I've tried to describe  This color  I don't  It's  It's the worst  Orange 
[00:55:00]  Red  Combo  You could think of  It looks like  It was supposed to be  Something else  And someone fucked the color up  It's extremely ugly  Yeah  Exceptionally so  What color is it Sam  Do you even know  I don't know  What this color is  It's like a weird  There's like a tinge  Of rust  To it  Yes  Rust  Orange  Red  Rust  Yeah it's like a brick  Orange  Red  Crimson  No not crimson  I see sort of orange in there  I would call it  A brick speckled rust 
[00:55:30]  Ah yes  It is the color of brick  Is that what it is  And then there's white speckles in it  And then black speckles  I want things that are speckled  The white and the black speckles  Living in harmony  Yeah  On our console  On our console  So  It looks old  Why don't we  It does look old  Like I don't think at any point  Did it look new  It's an old looking  Oh boy  He's lifting the board up  Yeah look how easy it is to move  Oh boy  Just move this thing  Well you know what 
[00:56:00]  I mean it's good that you're in the talk stages  Because you know what talking very often leads to  Nothing  That's exactly right absolutely  But at least it keeps us calm for a while  Nothing  And then we realize we're on to them  And then we move on to the next talking point  Right  Well that's not going to get done  What's the next talking point  How this place runs  I demand Sal play drums today  Yeah  So tell the radio wizard  That we're having drums in here today  Just so that one guy upstairs  Has to either go get the drums 
[00:56:30]  Or set them up  No problem  I mean you demand it  It's going to happen  Well tell them that it's a storyline  That is just hanging there from Friday  We've got to have an ending to that  We've got to tie up that ribbon  That's right  We also have clips if you want  Later on of  Denny  Doing the worst of the week countdown  Was it good?  I heard it was great  He killed it  He did kill it?  Mm-hmm  He finally added some professionalism  To some of the shows on this channel  Oh yeah  Alright yeah  I want to hear some clips after the break  Yeah we got some of those  Alright we'll do that 
[00:57:00]  We got some gun talk I guess  Yeah it's a little bit  We haven't really done gun talk  On our show before  Gun talk  Yeah sure  We'll kind of  Get through this  Jim Carrey's got an anti-gun song  He certainly does  But it's social satire  So he made sure  It maintained hilarity  That we have come to expect  From Jim Carrey  I'm so tired of Canadians  Trying to weasel their way  Into our second amendment conversation  Yeah  Just stay out of it Canadian  You don't know  You don't know how I feel  And a shout out 
[00:57:30]  I did it on Twitter  But it's worth doing here  I found another great podcast  Ooh  I never realized that like  I always wondered where our next competition would come from  I didn't realize it was going to come from our friends  Uh oh  Yeah  Our friends are now competing with us  Damn  How did that happen?  Oh I bet I know who it is  Oh no  That was a general statement to be honest  It's a podcast you already know about  Jay Morris is very very good  Jay Morris  Yeah  He's extremely focused when he does his podcast 
[00:58:00]  Which is really strange to me  Because we get a very different version of him in here  Yeah then he  But man when he does his podcast  He is fucking focused  He's got questions  On point  Direction  It's amazing  I feel like I'm listening to a completely different guy  Because he comes here and uh  I don't know  He throws all the rules out the window  Doesn't he?  I love when we start talking  Here's what happens  And Jay's here  He'll sit down in a chair  He'll pull a mic up  We're talking about something  And I see Jay like reading something 
[00:58:30]  Or just looking around the room  Going uh oh  Here we go  He's not listening to what we're saying  Which means  At any minute  He's just going to interject a non sequitur  Right  Which will completely derail what we're talking about  But then  Then we play a game where we chase him  The rest of the time  Yeah yeah yeah  Because then we're like  Alright we were going to do this  But you're doing that  So we'll do that with you  We'll go with it  So then we're chasing  What I mean by chasing is  Now we're on point with him  We're on board with him  And then he moves on to the next thing  Oh then he's gone  So now like  Alright we'll chase you over here now 
[00:59:00]  Maybe we'll stop here for a little while  But on his podcast  Holy fuck  There's listening  There's fucking thought  Questions  Wow  Show prep  Amazing  But he did a podcast with a guy I fucking love  Phil Hendry man  Phil Hendry is the real deal  Hey Hendry  And those two finally got together and did a podcast together  Oh that's cool  Yeah  Jay Moore is what  Fake Mustache Studios on fucking somewhere  I don't know  I don't know how to find his podcast  I just put him in search engines and they pop up 
[00:59:30]  Yeah  But Phil Hendry  Holy fuck man  Yeah good  He's the guy that you know does everything  Yeah yeah  He does interviews with himself  Yeah no one knew for the longest time  He would  He would have an expert on  That would get everyone riled up out there  But he would  He would be interviewing the expert  Which would be himself  From some fake organization  Yeah  And then he would take phone calls  And sometimes he was the callers as well  So he was the  Interviewer  The interviewee  And 
[01:00:00]  And the phone calls coming in  Quite clever  And  I don't  I don't know how it got out that  This was going down  Because for the longest time  I don't think a lot of people really  Really knew  Yeah  And he said on Jay's podcast  I think he  I think he does close to 50  At least 30  30 plus  Characters  Unique characters  For his radio show  And now podcast  So  Phil Hendry  He's  He's  He's a  He's a talent man  And he's one of those guys that  You know 
[01:00:30]  He always thought out of the box as well  Like ourselves  Does Jay Moore have four podcasts  By himself  Is he one of those guys  Is it Jay Moore  Saturday Night Live  Talk  Jay Moore  The early years  He just  In a weird  I don't know  If he's not thinking  He doesn't understand the future  He just does the one podcast  Wow  Yeah  You know  People that are in the know  Know you gotta do  Like at least four  Right  About different subjects  Yeah man  Why do a segment  In one podcast 
[01:01:00]  When you could do four  Totally independent podcasts  I'm a podcast fan  But I only need  I only need an hour  Oh boy  Tops  Hour and a half  Maybe  Maybe  And these guys  That do more than one podcast  You can't keep up with that  Well the trick to podcasting  Is limiting what you can talk about  Because you have separated it  So many times  To very niche things  Like let's just say  The Simpsons  Right  Yeah  Or your friends  You grew up with  Right  You rock  Are you past the whole 
[01:01:30]  Four to five podcast thing  Comment  Yes  Just do one good solid podcast  But this week  I got my pals  I grew up with  Next week  You know what  We're gonna do  A little Simpsons thing  Oh boy  Now you're talking  Fucking  Two different shows  Yeah  But Hendry's been fired a lot  Because you know  He's another guy  That management  Never really understood  And wanted to control  And all that shit  And he was tough to sell as well  Some of the stuff 
[01:02:00]  They were talking about  On this podcast  I was like wow  We can kind of relate  To some of this stuff  We should get Phil Hendry  On our show  Just to talk  We are  Yeah  Cool man  Alright  We'll do some other shit  Some gun talk  I guess  Michael Moore  Has something to say  Bloomberg has something to say  Michael Moore's an idiot  Bloomberg's an idiot  Fucking  We all should have  Rocket launchers  Right in  Oh yeah  Everyone's got  Rocket launchers  Of course  That's what we should have  In the end  Why wouldn't you  Nukes  Nukes on 
[01:02:30]  Would that mean  You should be able  To have  You know  The musket  Shut up  Shut up  The only thing  I'll add to that  Is you know  When they bring up  The forefathers  Yeah  I'll say it again  If you asked the forefathers  Where we're at today  It would have been split  Right down the fucking middle  Probably  Stop  Stop with what  The forefathers  Were thinking  They would never  Have worked together  They would have  Never worked together  The forefathers  If you fucking  Dug them up  And put them  In chairs somewhere  First of all  That would be 
[01:03:00]  Creepy as hell  Very  But you would  Pretty much get  Half of them  Saying yeah  You know what  It's not a good idea  Anymore  And the other half  Is well no  This is what we wanted  Yeah  They wouldn't be  In agreement  That's where we are  At all  No  Of course not  Hirokh  Please play something  I'm just babbling  This  Is the  Opinetry show  The Opinetry show  Uh oh 
[01:03:30]  What's going on  A lot of Van Halen news  Is there Van Halen news  On top of the world  Oh yeah  I can do karaoke  I know I can  She had her hand  She had her toes  In the sky  Yeah what a  Definitely  What a beautiful girl  Oh yeah

[01:05:00]  Is there a buzz  About us playing  Drums in the elevator today?

Takes  Takes  What does that mean?  I don't know  I don't know 
[01:14:00]  Whatever Dennis says  I assume is correct  Yeah because he's  The professional  Yeah  He certainly is  Alright we got the drum set  Being set up  So finally you guys  Get to hear Sal play  The drums  Is he going to play  To a track?  I don't know  How does this work  Usually  Well you probably  Get some headphones  Put on right  Yeah  And then  Play a track  Right  And we get to  Listen to you  Play along with  A song  Because when you  Just hear a drummer  Going off on a kid 
[01:14:30]  It's like  Right we get it  Shut up  Once we're done  With the drums  We should just leave them  Right outside the studio  And let that dude  Oh man  We should put them  In the trash  Yeah  Just say we're done  We're wild  Finished with these  Come get your drums  Hey as the guy  Set up in the corner  What's going on  With Amazing Race  And why did they  Have to apologize 
[01:15:00]  They said  They said white  They said what  Oh  Jesus  Sorry  I guess they were  Using a Hanoi Memorial  Yeah  Yeah  Downed a US plane  Yeah it's like  A big fountain-y thing  But they weren't  Like pulling their  Dicks out  And like fucking  Exploiting it  Were they  Nah  So what's the problem  Well the thing is  It's uh  We have a good  Relationship now  With Vietnam  In a way  You know  We have tourism  And shit like that  And trade  But the truth 
[01:15:30]  Of the matter is  We pretty much  Lost that war  And they  Are proud  Of the fact  That they won  Right  You know  And the North won  So there are  Certain memorials there  That aren't quite  Good for us  Gotcha  One of them  Is a piece of a B-52  That was shot down  That's sitting in the middle  Of this little pond  Memorial  And they used it  As a backdrop  To one of their  Their segments 
[01:16:00]  And I think  A lot of  Vets are like  You know  That's  Eh  It's kind of not  What we kind of  Want to see  But it was more  Just a backdrop  To say hey  We're in Vietnam  Yeah  Yeah  It was a backdrop  I could see how  People would be  Upset by that  I mean  Right  You know  You don't have to  Rub it in their faces  It's a  Men died  In that plane  Sure  I was just wondering  If they were rubbing it  In anyone's faces  No I think they were  Just being stupid  And not realizing  That they probably 
[01:16:30]  Shouldn't do that  Right  It was like a checkpoint  Like oh we got to  Run to the market  Now we got to run  To the B-52 memorial  Oh okay  See  They used it as a part  Of the show  Well that's pretty bad  That's trivializing it  A little bit  Yes exactly  So CBS is apologizing  Yeah they apologize  They say Amazing Race  Is an amazing show  I can't get into it  Really  Nope  Everybody loves it  They say it's the best  Reality show by far  Who watches it  There's no way  I'm watching a reality show  On Sunday  That's not Celebrity Apprentice  How's Celebrity Apprentice 
[01:17:00]  Fucking awesome  Like every season  I love that show  Wow you're  You really like that one  I love Celebrity Apprentice  Who got kicked off  The black model chick  Claudia something  I think her name's Claudia  I don't know  She's one of those chicks  That you don't know  But she's very hot  But you don't know  Where she's from  So they had her on the show  For a couple weeks  Because she was hot  And then it's like  Alright we got to get rid of her  Well all these chicks  They're coming on  And they're like  Oh they're afraid  To bring Omarosa  Into the boardroom  Oh boy are you getting  Fucking hammered  For spoiler right now  And we had her in here 
[01:17:30]  It happened last night  We had her in here  She couldn't have been nicer  Omarosa  Yeah yeah yeah  She didn't seem like  The Omarosa you see on TV  That's for sure  Yeah she's not nice  We weren't scared of her  She was sitting right there  That's true  Right in the corner  That's right  So you're piped up  Anytime she wants  She did  She was  She was well behaved  There's Morgan Hates  Are on the show  Why  Rivalry from their  Stemming back  From their season  Piers  Yeah  He's a fucking dick anyway  Fucking limey 
[01:18:00]  Take a hike  Go back to your fucking  Go back to your own country  Where you're hated  For whatever the fuck  You were doing  With the press over there  Allegations up the ass  Huh  You're a fucking piece of shit  So you got a song to play  Yeah I was thinking of doing  A Rush song maybe  Of course  Rush  Is there any other band  When it comes to drumming  That you guys can figure out  It does show if you can play  But it's always Rush  If you guys want to pick  A different one  We could  We could do it 
[01:18:30]  Someone other than Rush  What Rush song  I think I do  I don't want to do a deep track  Do like Spirit of Radio  Of course  Of course you can do that one  Spirit of Radio  Good song  I like that one  What about YYZ  We could do  YYZ is great too  I'd love to do YYZ  Oh boy  You don't know how to do YYZ  I know how to do  Almost their whole catalog  Celebrate  Celebrate his entire catalog  You want to hear this  I certainly do  Which one do you want to do  YYZ  I guess we could start there  Start out with a little YYZ  If we cut you off  We'll cut you off  We don't have to play  The whole tune 
[01:19:00]  Oh we don't have to play  The whole thing  Thanks Sal  I really appreciate that  I was scared that  We would have to sit through that  You're getting nervous huh  I was getting a little nervous  How long have you been playing  13 years  13 years though  You gotta be pretty good  13 years  Yeah  I would think  Especially based on  He's a young guy  So that means he started  When he was a kid  Yeah and also  Something pesky like work  Didn't have to get in the way  He could have practiced a lot  Because he didn't have to work  Because his parents  Just fucking  Bummed the drum kit  And gave him money  No but you remember from Friday 
[01:19:30]  He saw people do hard jobs  That's true  He did  I got another bite of weed  A lot of controversy  Over Sandusky  Being interviewed by  NBC  Today show  Is it  Oh yeah  And you know  People look at us  And we're scumbags  We're this  We're that  You know  But they're  They're going for ratings  And it's another  Freak show situation  Of course  What is he going to say  At this point  And there's people  That are kind of pissed off  That anyone's interviewing  Sandusky 
[01:20:00]  They should just let him rot  They all know it's for ratings  You know  NBC is hurting bad  Matt Lauer's on his way out  I think  You know what  Also  Why do people  Insist on giving these prisoners  Like  An exciting day  Right  Like every day  Should be  Boring  Mundane  You're in fucking  Prison  Kind of shit  You shouldn't be giving  This guy  The opportunity  To speak  First of all  To be heard  By a lot of people  And to bust up 
[01:20:30]  Is normally  Mundane  Fucking week  With something exciting  Like a television interview  Fuck him  Of course  Fuck him  But you know  I would love to know  What they are saying  About why they're  Interviewing him  You know  Be honest  Holy fuck  This is great for ratings  It's a freak show  That's what it is  Yep  When does that go down  Because obviously  I would want to watch that  I'm not going to sit here  And make believe  I'm not going to sit here  And make believe  But the fact is  That they're going to 
[01:21:00]  Try to spin it  Like no man  You know  This is  This is kind of important  And we're trying to  Get something done here  No you're not  You want everyone  To tune in  Because this guy  Is a fucking monster  Yeah  And they're going to  Be cordial  Toward the guy too  You know  They're going to  Keep it on a  Professional level  Which will drive  A lot of people  Nuts too  You should first  Beat him with the camera  Today  Today yeah  What show  Yeah  Today  Yeah I know  It's going to  Broadcast  Today  But on what show  Today  They're saying 
[01:21:30]  That old  That old  Literally old  Gag  The lawyers  How did they  Get away with that one  Who's on first  Oh god  Enough  The Sandusky lawyer  Says it's not  Technically a  Today show  Like the Today show  Didn't conduct  The interview  Right  It's excerpts  From a documentary  Excerpts  Excerpts  Oh yeah  There's a filmmaker  Involved  And the filmmaker  Is defending his  Oh 
[01:22:00]  His interview  With Sandusky  How's he defending  His interview  With Sandusky  I don't know  No  Because there's  A spin in there  What's the spin  That he's trying  To have people believe  I don't know  It's a freak show  You know  Just say it is  Splash is a freak show  Sandusky on the  Today show  Is another freak show  We are actually  Going to put a camera  And a microphone  In front of a guy  That fucked a kid  Up the ass  In the shower  Come on everybody  You're going to  Want to see this  They heard it  Going thwock 
[01:22:30]  Thwock  Thwock  Ah please  And that's how  The Today shows  Get away with this  By the way  Because a few people  Defending NBC  Saying it's a third  Party doing the interview  Yeah this filmmaker  But it's still on  The Today  Oh  Oh you almost  Burn your dick off  Damn I almost  Could have sued  Fucking Starbucks  For millions  Hot coffee  And I think the defense  The spin that you're  Looking for is  The documentary  Is technically  Made to defend  Paterno  Oh really  Oh really  That's what the use  Of the interview is 
[01:23:00]  But obviously  It's just because  People will watch  The kid touch  Or talk  Paterno didn't do shit  Look at him talk  Point  Oh  He talks  Do they talk to him  About his life in prison  I don't know  I mean if it's about  Trying to clear  Paterno's name  Or something  And they talk to  This fucking monster  Do they ask him questions  Like hey  Have you been raped  In prison yet  You know like you did  To those kids  Right  Did you  That should 
[01:23:30]  That should be the question  Of course  So a lot of people  Are wondering  Have you  In the shower  Gotten a man's  Dick up your ass  You know like you did  To the kids  Comment  Comment  Would he enjoy that though  Based on his past  Performance  I probably not  I don't think he  Was  Put a bottom  In those relationships  But we protect  The high profile  Prisoners  So  Well yeah  No one's gonna  Get to him  Anytime soon  He interviewed him  Three times  This filmmaker  For a total 
[01:24:00]  Of three and a half  Hours  So why don't  We interview him  Gave him a fucking  Who's that guy  Little bit of life  Why can't we  Interview the guy  He's releasing  A very small portion  Of the interview  Via audio clips  Which are gonna be  Aired first  On the today show  Alright well  Get those clips  I don't know  I just put it up  So we could see it  Oh  I changed the channel  I mean  Is it tomorrow  No it'll be  Today  Ah  What show is that  Today  Somebody 
[01:24:30]  Somebody just wrote  I just watched  The interview  On the today show  Oh really  So maybe  Did we just  Fuck that one up  Did we miss it  Maybe we just  Missed it  Oh damn  We're playing  Dumb Denny clips  When we could've been  Playing a  Sandusky thing  Maybe it was when  We were setting up  The big drum solo  That's about to go down  Did we really just  Miss it  Oops  Whoopsie  Maybe they'll replay it  We'll get it  We'll get it  Second time around  The cluelessness  Of us though  Everyone's  Calling and saying  Idiots  They just played it  Well tell all those 
[01:25:00]  Idiots that they  Should be listening  To our show  Instead of watching  But see what they  Did was  They're fans of our show  But they knew  The today show  Thing was a big deal  So they went over there  Watched that  And now they're back  That's what happens  They were sitting there  Going apparently  These guys aren't  Going to cover  The Sandusky thing  They're talking about  Denny  Denny  We should've set it up  And then we would've  Said don't worry  We'll just fucking  Pop the today show  On when it happens  Someone would've been  Hey it's on  Right  No  Alright Sal  You ready for  What are you doing  YYZ  Yeah let's do YYZ  And then what  Spirit of Radio 
[01:25:30]  Yeah whatever  And then what  Tom Sawyer  Tom Sawyer  And then Roll the Bones  We could do Roll the Bones  And then maybe go deep track  Maybe a little trees  And then what  It'd be great if you  Fucked with everybody's head  And just did the same thing  You did on Friday  Except ended the show now  At like 740  You know what  It's not a bad idea  What a good idea  They would understand  Down the hall  Sam's got a good idea  Just keeping the bit going man  It's all for jokes  That's the joke  That's the joke  That's why we're here 
[01:26:00]  Good idea  I also want to talk about  Trash  Trash to treasure  In a little while  Trash to treasure  That stupid bowl  You saw that stupid bowl  Oh I did see the stupid bowl  That's everyone's dream  Well unless you go to  Pawn Stars  Well it's not really  Demand for a bowl  You know what are you  Going to do  Eat cereal out of it  You can't even use it  Right  I'll give you 200 bucks  For it  Imagine  Alright  I'm pretty happy  With what I got  And then they're in the  Back room coming in  Because they know  What they got now  Coming in it  Yeah they're all  Circle jerking  In the bowl 
[01:26:30]  They're like holy fuck  The guy believed us  Do you trust anyone  In a pawn shop  No  Of course not  It's so  I mean they're in Vegas  So obviously they know  They could prey on people  That just want to bet  So they come in  With these things  And they're not going to  Honestly tell you  What something's worth  Oh let me have my expert  Come in  And they're fucking  All asshole buddies  Of the guys in the pawn shop  Of course  They probably get a kickback  This guy saw the interview 
[01:27:00]  On the Today Show  Why?  First hand account  Dave what happened man  Because we didn't see it  Holy fuck  Dave  Dave  Dave from Jersey  Jersey  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  What's your name  Dave  Alright  Alright that's you  Alright so far so good  Where are you from  I saw the Today interview  Right before I got in the car  To come to work  And turn you guys on  So I wasn't missing your show  Thank you  What time was it on  Oh it was on like 
[01:27:30]  Eight  I'm sorry  Seven thirty  Was that yesterday  No today  It's morning  Funny funny funny  Yeah is  Is this  No I know  It is but not how  Exactly  Now it's going too deep  Dave go ahead  So what  What do they do  This guy was just  Trying to defend  Joe Paterno  That's all his intent was  And the interview  It wasn't a video  Of Sandowski  It was just 
[01:28:00]  Dave we said most of this  So what could you add  It was  The whole thing  This guy  Joe Paterno's family  Did not want  This stuff to go through  At all  They said that  They wrote a letter  To the Today show  Dave what did Sandowski say  Sandowski basically  Didn't admit to anything  And then  He said that  I got it here  If you want  Get in the locker room  You know  Great  Something happened  Great  Oh Dave  Yeah yeah  You hold on for a  Lifetime  Go ahead 
[01:28:30]  In the very beginning  And I know that I'm going to  Get attacked from everybody  Because no one wants the truth  When you say this has been  A rush to judgment  From the very beginning  After over a year  Of examining this case  Do you know  Rush to judgment  With Jerry Sandowski  In person and by phone  Do you believe  He was wrongly convicted  Well Jerry Sandowski  Already had his day in court  But do you believe  He was wrongly convicted  I saw  I've spoken extensively  About this at our website  But I wanted to say  That my focus here 
[01:29:00]  Has been on Joe Paterno  I understand  But it helps me  With perspective  Here in the interview  Well no  Jerry Sandowski  Had his day in court  Joe Paterno never did  I'm trying to get  Joe Paterno  Effectively his day in court  But do you believe  Jerry Sandowski  Is a pedophile  And he's guilty  Of the things  He was accused of  I have no doubt  That Jerry Sandowski  Was guilty of  Many of the things  If not all the things  That he was accused of  But I do believe  That there were  Due process problems  With the trial  Alright so  Your main problem  With some of the evidence  Brought against  Jerry Sandowski  Has to do with  Victim number two 
[01:29:30]  This is the guy  For our viewers  So they remember here  This is the guy  That Mike McQuarrie testified  That he saw in a shower  With Jerry Sandowski  McQuarrie  McQuarrie  What happened in that shower  Came up in the courtroom  Do you think Mike McQuarrie  Testified truthfully  In the trial  About the incident  With victim number two  And Jerry Sandowski  Well it depends  On which version  Of Mike McQuarrie's testimony  You believe  I don't know that Mike McQuarrie  Is lying by the way  I think a large part  Of what's happened here  Is over ten years  Your memory changes  And then when a prosecution  Is desperate for a witness 
[01:30:00]  They might twist your arm  A little bit  And I think it's important  To keep in mind  We didn't have as much  Information about Jerry Sandowski  In 2001  As we do now  And I think as far as  Victim two is concerned  That's really the big news  Out of my interview  I now know  Who victim two is  I know his identity  And I know incredibly  Important things about him  And let me just interrupt you  We've made the agreement here  Because of NBC  Victim two  That we are not going to  Identify victim number two  Oh why  Because your  Journalistic standards  About what victim two did  NBC  Shut up 
[01:30:30]  The year of 2011  That shed an entirely new light  On that McQuarrie episode  He very publicly  And I have the documentation  To prove this  In his own name  Said that the accusers  Of Jerry Sandowski  Are not to be believed  And that Jerry Sandowski  Was the greatest thing  That ever happened to him  He gave a police interview  In September of that year  Saying Jerry Sandowski  Never molested me  And the investigators  Tried to get him to lie  And then on the day  Joe Paterno was fired  I have it in my hands  This is an interview  He gave to an FBI  Trained investigator  A former police officer  Saying that nothing  Happened in the shower  That night 
[01:31:00]  That McQuarrie is lying  And that the investigators  Tried to get him to lie  Now that doesn't mean  Well let's remember something  The victim number two  Never  Yeah that's  Because Paterno  Was trying to protect  His legacy  And the school's legacy  Just because he said it  Doesn't mean it's true  It was in his best interest  To kind of you know  Say hey  None of that happened  I do agree with the guy  That Paterno never really  Got his day in court  But you could see where  He would say something  Like that  Sure  Just because he said it  To an FBI agent  Doesn't mean it's true  No 
[01:31:30]  He would have motives  Obviously to say  Something like that  How long is this thing  I don't know  Maybe we could cut it up  Doesn't end  Yeah  It's never ending  Do you want me  I can listen to it  In like preview  And then I'll just find  The exact interview clips  Yeah just give us  The goodness  It's Monday man  Yeah we just want goodness  Just give us the goodness  We can't be  Toiling over  A fucking never ending clip  You don't even know  How long it is  No I have no clue  Let's go till 10 
[01:32:00]  I got a cheesesteak  Shit I gotta get to  Oh man  I gotta take a piss  Oh fuck man  A cheesesteak  A Philly cheesesteak  Shit  I eat really well  But when I go down to Philly  Man they don't know  How to eat well down there  Holy shit  They don't even know  What a vegetable is  And I get sucked in  But man  Man I'd love a good cheesesteak  But look how I'm sitting  Oh you're fucking  Side saddle  I'm siding  You're doing a side saddle  Because uh  What  Are you  Are you turtling  You got these red  Peppery things you put on

[01:33:00]  And I took that  On Ritz cracker  Nice  With a little cheddar cheese  On top of it  Nice  I had  I like  My dinner  Was hors d'oeuvres  Nice  And I'm shoving them  In my fucking mouth  It was great  And then it's like  Old squeaky hinge tummy  And now I got a kid 
[01:33:30]  That's ratting me out  With the farts  Oh really  I was able to get away  With that  I'd blame it on the baby  Who cares  But now he's  He's talking back  Saying it wasn't  Wasn't him  Son of a bitch  Shit  A little rat  He's a little rat  Hors nose  Sometimes you know  Something squeaks out  That you didn't mean  To have squeaked out  But you have a baby around  You can blame the baby  And the kid goes  No it wasn't me  Yeah well that's  What he's saying now  Yes  A fucking six month old 
[01:34:00]  With fucking  Cheese steak farts  Wait a minute  Something suspicious there  You know what I also had  For the first time  I swear  In years  At Budokan  Who treated us like  Fucking rock stars  Down there in Philly  Not so much  Mortimotos  Yeah  Something like that  Mortimoto  Treated us like  Shit  I'm still waiting  For my apology  Spare ribs  Oh spare ribs  Holy shit  Were they greasy 
[01:34:30]  They were  What you're thinking  Uh huh  And that's why  I don't eat them  Every fucking day  Oh yeah  It's fucking whale songs  In your belly  You're sitting there  Fucking communicating  With whales  From your fucking  Cheese and oil belly  And I mix that  With some tuna  Sushi pizza  Wow  You would like that  I know you're not  Sushi guy  But if I put a nice  Tuna sushi pizza  In front of you  You would really like it  That Mr. Hughes

[01:35:30]  Roland knows  Everything about food  You can bring it  In the day before  Let it sit around  The office  Oh under some  Hot light  Right  Yeah  Talk about  Spare ribs  Oh my god  Yeah  I don't eat  Spare ribs  For that reason  The grease  The fat  I know  You know what  It is  And you know what  One fucking spare rib  Would be fine  You get to taste it  It's not really  Doing a lot of damage  It's just one  But you can't  Fucking eat one  Of delicious things  No

[01:36:30]  Number two  Let's play it  I don't understand  How I would have  Walked into that  Locker room  Where he was  And heard sounds  And associated  That was  Sex  Going on  You know  Like he said  That could have been  I mean  There was  There would have been  That would have been  The last thing  I would have thought about  I would have thought  Maybe he had fallen around 
[01:37:00]  Or something like that  But I  Here's a statement  From the attorneys  For victim number two  I didn't understand that  He was talking about  The guy who said  I heard sounds  And Jerry Sandusky says  I don't see how  He could have thought  That he heard  Sounds of sex  I would have never  Thought of that  But then he goes  Maybe some fooling around  Or something  Maybe sounds  That was sounds  Of fooling around  In the shower  Not sex  Wasn't that skin slapping  Basically  Exactly  Is what he described 
[01:37:30]  I get  Fooling around  With little boys  In the shower  Is like  Like something  We joke about  Yeah  That's  Well  Because that's  Much better  Than  Fucking him  In the ass  I mean  That shark video  Is ridiculous  I know I'm  All over the place  Today  But  I thought they  Fucking  Had that figured out  Where he could go  In the cage  And check out  Sharks real close  Cage goes in the water  Shark in the water  You see how big  That great white was too  Fucking great  It went right  Into the fucking  Shark cage  Those things  Swim shallow  It's frightening  Don't know what that 
[01:38:00]  Bastard shark  Will do with it  Might eat it  I suppose  Someone eat a  Rocking chair once  Like his little story  Someone eat a  Rocking chair once  I saw a shark  Diving once  Yeah  Yeah they're very skittish  And they swim away  Immediately  Unless they eat you  All fish are skittish  And swim away from you  Almost immediately  99.9% of sharks  Will probably swim away  From you  Right  Oh boy that  Point one  Yeah  Oh boy do they make a mess  That's a motherfucker  Right  That's the bitch  Yeah  Point one comes and 
[01:38:30]  Shoves his great white  Face into a cage  Yeah  He's really  Because he's so hungry  What shark is the number  One as far as  Biting humans  Get a little knowledge  Out there today  I will say  The  Tiger shark  God damn  Kumia  No  Give yourself a  Mother-hucking bell  It was  Yes it is  Tiger shark  Tiger shark  Bites more humans  Than any other shark  LOL  Anthony's an idiot  Alright  Why  LOL  I sent you out of the room 
[01:39:00]  For saying tiger shark  I don't know  LOL though  What if he was just joking  For saying tiger shark  No I don't know what  It seems like I was an idiot  Before that  But you know what  How are you an idiot  I didn't hear anything in there  Hey it's like Russian roulette  In this pal talk room  If I happen to look down  At the text  And see something I don't like  I can't put it in context  I just gotta fucking  Get your ass out of the room  You're a distraction to me  Roland we're starting to build  The Friday initiative show  And I want to start with  And this is what's weird about it  By Friday we're gonna have  A whole bunch of little things 
[01:39:30]  I want  Tuna  Sushi pizza  Morimoto's has a  There's a Morimoto in New York  Oh shit  Oh boy  Were you listening to  The first hour  Moral conundrum  Right here  They treated me like shit  In Philly  They did  Yep  I'm waiting for my apology  Morimoto  It wasn't good for Morimoto  At the beginning of the show  I had it at Budokan  So maybe we called  The New York City  Budokan people  No the Morimoto people  I went into a completely  Empty restaurant  Right when it opened  Morimoto down in Philly 
[01:40:00]  I said I know  We don't have a reservation  I acknowledged that  Right off the bat  Like I want to respect your place  And I understand this is a McDonald's  I got six people  And you know  We want to have a quick meal  And she looked at her  Her screen  Said the first reservation  Is 1030  And then I said  Because there's a new audience  Every 11 minutes  Of course  Every 11 minutes  Remember that  From the bosses  Of course  There's a lot of new people  Right now  I said  Well  Do you have invisible people 
[01:40:30]  In here right now  Because I don't see anyone  I was just trying to have  A little fun with it  And be a little light  She wouldn't move  She was a dick to me  Dare I say the C word  I'll say twat  I don't like saying cunt  I'll say twat  She was a twat  She was a twat to me  And then I said  The reservations  The first one's at 1030  But it was an empty restaurant  There's no way  Those tables are going to  Fill up in the next hour  There's no fucking way  It happens here too  I always make reservations  Because when you walk in 
[01:41:00]  It's empty but  Within the half hour  Yeah but what  It's more than that  What was that about  They get off on  Being able to tell people  We're such a hot place  That we can't sit you  Yeah  Be honest  You know the restaurant business  Yeah it happens  But then it draws  People will make reservations  Then you're booked up  For three or four months  Yeah  Right  But it's delicious  But then we went to Budokan  Which is in the same  I would say they're the  Same level restaurant  Or close  Budokan maybe  Maybe slightly below 
[01:41:30]  A Mortemoto  Morimoto  They're almost like  The towel  They're almost like  The same  Alright so I called them  I said look  We don't have a reservation  We're right around the corner  We'd like to you know  Have a meal  They said come on down  They couldn't have been nicer  Oh  And then we walked in  We're like we just called  Oh yeah good  We were expecting you  And they showed us  Right to a table  And by the way  They had more people  In their restaurant  At five o'clock  Than Morimoto did  Or Morimoto  Hold on here  I'm kind of getting this  So you called 
[01:42:00]  You called  Budokan  And said  Hey we want to come down  Yeah but we were walking  By the other joint  Yeah no no I know  Oh I should have called  From outside the joint  Well no I'm just saying  Like like  Alright  Morimoto's was all booked up  Their reservations were full  Until 1030  Right  How do you know  Budokan  Just didn't have an opening  And what you honestly did  When you called  Was pretty much  Made a reservation  You son of a bitch  Maybe they weren't being nice  Maybe they just had an opening 
[01:42:30]  And you reserved it  It wasn't officially  A reservation  If I said  We're right around the corner  Yeah maybe they had an opening  So what  I should have called  Morimoto from outside  Their front door  Maybe  Instead of walking in  Like a gentleman  Saying I'd rather do this  Face to face  If they had a reservation  Yeah  But explain to me  How the restaurant  That had people in it  Could fit me in  But the place  That had no one  And I mean no one  Maybe a couple  I kind of remember  On the left side  So maybe a two top  Was just sitting down  Maybe they had  A table for six 
[01:43:00]  And nothing else  But you got lucky  When you called  And they said  Yeah come on down  But they already had  A lot of people  In there enjoying  And the other place  Was empty  The place that was empty  Said no  The place that had  You know  They probably were  A third full already  They fit us in  They had plenty of tables  To fit us in  Both places  I think you're praising  A restaurant  For taking a reservation  Son of a bitch  Well Budokar can make it up to me  By bringing some  Tuna sushi pizza  I don't think I'd be into 
[01:43:30]  Tuna sushi pizza  I want you to try it  Even a bite  There are two things  I don't like putting together  Fish and pizza  But it's not like  Pizza traditional  Red sauce  It's like  One of those  Fancy schmancy pizzas  It's the pizza dough  Which is nice  And then you got the  You know  The tuna sliced  Nice and thin  Really good color  Of tuna  Olive  Sushi  And then put like  Eel sauce  A little onion  It's nice  A little like  Spicy mayo  But not too much  It's really good  You should take one bite  You can spit it out 
[01:44:00]  If you don't like it  Can we get some  For Friday  If you don't like it  Spit it out  Don't go to Morimoto  Until they apologize  Spit it  Yeah  Alright  It just  Sushi is like  What's wrong with sushi  On a Friday  Nothing  You can't buy it  The day before  Yeah  No  Alright so someone's  Got to open up their joint  And get their sushi  Because those places  Don't open until five  What do you think  Iraq sushi and sake  What are we doing  What are we doing  Come on  Hamid  Get him Hamid 
[01:44:30]  No I'm still  Team Budokan  Morimoto  Just were  Really  Incredibly rude  Damn them  Down there in Philly  Their Philly operation  Not so  Not so nice  I don't know  About the New York operation  Nah fuck him  Fuck him  Fuck him in the ace  Alright so where are we at  I think we were going to  Take a piss  You were going to  Take a cheesesteak shit  I would like to  I'm going to try to  Blow some fucking  Snot out my nose  Alright  And we'll come back  All drained of that 
[01:45:00]  Pesky fluid  Okay  And uh  We'll have Sal play the drums  Sal's going to play  Some fucking drums for us  We're going to talk about  Trash to treasure  I know that  We certainly could talk  Guns today  There's a few gun things  There's some gun stories  The mayor of course  Getting involved in  The national level  Which is what any mayor  Should do  And um  Yeah who the fuck  At least the mayor  Yeah  Cause we've said it the other way  At least he's not being a pussy  He's at least taking on  A much tougher  Uh thing here  Than the dumb sugary drink 
[01:45:30]  So I respect him on that level  I think it's a distraction  From what?  From what he should be doing  Paying attention to New York City  Cause people are laughing  At the sugary drink thing  Yeah true  But we make fun of him  For not uh  You know  Taking on the tougher  I know  It is a  It is a tougher  This is a much  Much tougher one  So at least he's uh  I respect him for that  I guess  I'll be at misguided  Well they're all misguided  Aren't they  So I say  Alright  Uh  Sal drums next  For real  We're not  We're not  We can't do the gag twice 
[01:46:00]  It's just stupid  And you didn't see the gag coming  By the way  You may believe you did  But you just did not  I'm sorry  When you said  You knew Stockholm Syndrome  I was like  Does Opie really know  Stockholm Syndrome?  Yeah  That was what  Kind of got me a little nervous  I noticed the time  I was like  I'm getting cut off  Yeah  I like that band  Muse is awesome  Yeah I know  Play him it's a break  You rock  Oh  You're listening  To the Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Show  Show 
[01:46:30]  Van Halen Day 
[01:47:00]  34 years ago today  Van Halen released  Van Halen 2  Oh Van Halen 2  Speaking of number 2 Opie  Yeah  Did you happen to go to the  End stall in the bathroom?  I did not  Holy shit  Someone blew it up  I took a picture of it  And tweeted it  Oh  It is  The worst ever?  If Sam  When Sam comes back  You pop it up on the  Oh yeah  Or you can just look at it  It's  I don't know  What the fuck happened  To whoever was in there  It's so incredibly bad 
[01:47:30]  At 530 this morning  I heard people bitching  About a stall in the bathroom  But I'm like  Yeah  That's just  Regular shit  No that's  There it is  Let me see  Here it comes  It's just  It's the entire  Liquid portion  Of the ball  Is  Is shit  It looks like a frothy  Starbucks drink  It's hot  Hot cocoa  It looks like  Cappuccino  With some extra cinnamon 
[01:48:00]  It's fucking disgusting  What fucking animals  Of course  That's Anthony Cumia  Yes it is  Twitter  Yes  Anthony  C-U-M-I-A  Yeah  Oh it's hilarious  I walked in there  And all I had to do  Was blow my nose  But you know  I like going to the stall  So you can just rip off  As many tissues as you need  And I walked in that one  And I just went  Whoa  I snapped a picture  And backed right out  Oh my god  That's mud  Right  That's mud  Up on the sides  Yeah  The entire bowl  Was full of mud 
[01:48:30]  And then it looks like  Someone was wiping their ass  With paper towels  And not toilet paper  Yeah it was just  A disgusting  Thing  That is  That's the stall  All the way to the end  If you want to see it live  I absolutely do  Yeah  That's a good one  We've talked over the years  Man there's animals  That work here  Fucking animals  I really believe  They got actual animals  They do radio shows  Because who would leave  A bathroom like that  Fucking animal  That's terrible  That's a good one 
[01:49:00]  Very nice  Yeah  So the Morimoto thing  Gets even  What?  More interesting  Why?  What happened?  Well people are now  Tweeting the Morimoto guy  Morimoto  I was treated  Not that well  At Morimoto in Philly  I never was able  To even sit down  At the restaurant  Because I showed up  At 5 o'clock  To an empty restaurant  And their first reservation  Was 10.30  Anyway someone goes  Hey did you tip the hostess  And I was telling Ant  On the way to the bathroom 
[01:49:30]  I'm like I didn't have a chance  To even tip the hostess  Because she was so rude  I had  I had  I swear to you too  Because I get that  Dumb reputation  Which is from years ago  I had 20 bucks in my hand  Ready to go  A tip is for services rendered  You're talking greasing her  Right  Before you get in there  Well I had the 20  Because I knew I was doing  Something like  Restaurant opens  5 o'clock  It's empty  I know they're a busy place  They're going to sit us  And understand  And I'm going to go  Well thank you so much  Here's a little something  For you  Right?  Right  I didn't get to that point 
[01:50:00]  Because she was so rude  Even when I was making  A joke about the invisible  People in the restaurant  So I still had that 20  So when I went to Budokan  They got the 20  And they're like  What's this for?  I'm like  For fitting us in  And she goes  Oh you didn't have to do that  But of course  They like when you do that  Well sure  And it was fine  I gave her the 20  But I never had the chance  Because then I told you  Like it's one thing  To go  Hey man  Thank you  Here's a little something  For you  But after they tell you  Look first reservations  At 10.30  What now you're supposed  To awkwardly go  Well will this help? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah  I'm not that guy  I can't do that  Well maybe Mr. Washington  Could get me in  A little sooner  Have you played that game though?  Where the  Maybe this will help game?  I feel way too awkward  To try that move  Like the  Are you sure  There's nothing we can do?  And you kind of like  Have the money  That's weird  Are you sure?  Because I like  I like sliding that  Before they  Before they say  Anything  Because that could  Put them in an  Awkward position  Right  I've done it  At the parking garages 
[01:51:00]  Right  Where they wave you off  And go  No no room  No room  Right  Especially for an Escalade  You drive in  They're like  No room  It's like they're  Looking at a tank  Every time  Yeah yeah  You're not used  To Escalade's  Parking yet  I know  Oh my god  Right  So I usually  I just  I hang a 20  Out the window  And I wave it a little  And I go  No room  Come this way  Come this way  Nice  So it works  In that case  So I should have  Walked in with the  20 in my hand  Like waving it around  Like a lunatic  Waving it around 
[01:51:30]  Hey  You got a table  I can't be that guy  That now breaks out  The money after  I've been told something  Yeah after you're told  But then again  Your scenario  That makes perfect sense  You know what  If you'd walk in  And you go like this  You got your 20  You walk up to her  And you go  You go look  I know it's last minute  I'm hoping you have room  You know  I'd really appreciate  And then you give her  The 20  I'd really appreciate  And then it's like  How great would it be  If she has to give  The 20 back  Because I would ask  For the 20 back  At that point  Well you have to 
[01:52:00]  They can't take it  And say no  They'd be like  Oh we don't  I hate when they go  We don't do that here  You've heard that  Yeah I've gotten that  Where  Where  Where they give it back  To you and go  Oh no we can't accept that  We don't do that here  Applebee's  No  It's so fucking annoying  Yeah  Alright you want to hear  Sal play the drums  Yes  Finally  He's so stupid  I know we can  Keep him on the hook  All day long  And not do it again  We did that already  It's so obvious  But  Yeah  What  It's obvious right 
[01:52:30]  Yeah  Yeah and I like  That you clarified  The reason it's obvious  Is because he's so stupid  He knows it  He does right  Yeah  What  What selection  Are we going to hear now  Is it YYZ  I think we should  Do Spirit of Radio  A little more lyrical  You know  People are saying  A little more lyrical  As you play the drums  Who's singing to this  Yeah really  Well you know  Are we going to sing too  No I'm not going to sing  Well instrumental  But if you're doing  An instrumental  Wouldn't an instrumental song  Work the best  I think it would be  Pretty instrumental  You pick out the song 
[01:53:00]  With the best drums  Not the best singing  Somebody said that  If Sal  Remember when I called him stupid  I remember  If Sal's doing it  If Sal's doing it  It's YYZ  Because you're boring  Well Sal  This is your segment  You know  You built this segment  So you do whatever  The fuck you want  Yeah you play whatever you want  What do you want  What do you want to do  Let's do Spirit of Radio  Spirit of the Radio  You're not playing to the song right  Of course not  Oh he's going to play to the track  Huh  Of course I'm going to play to the song  He's playing to the track  But mix it up a little bit  Right  We'll get to hear it  But can he only 
[01:53:30]  Can he only hear it  No I want to hear it  Don't you want to hear it  I don't know  You'll be able to hear him  Playing to the track  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah I want to see  If he's fucking good  Alright  Yeah and I just want to make sure  Eric turns it up loud enough  You know  It's very hard to tell  It's very hard to tell  If he's just playing drums  You know  You don't hear the music  Alright  And Rush is a good song  And that Spirit of Radio  Is alright  Yes  Go ahead  Alright  Now 
[01:54:00]  Here we go  Start now  You missed it  What happened  Uh oh  What happened  Sal  You missed the big fucking  Here's what he did  Here's what he did  He started spinning his sticks around  And looking at it  Looks like a rock star  And then he missed the fucking  The drum cue  You didn't time your spin  He missed it  That was horrible  Holy shit  He's a showboater  Alright  Alright  Let's start again  Alright  I'm trying to get you to fucking hear it 
[01:54:30]  I can't even hear it  What happened  I can't even hear the track 
[01:55:00]  The drummer was supposed to lead it  No  You know what you need  You need the music so loud  That people can't hear your fucking drumming  Right  That's what you need  Eric just  Can you turn it up even louder  I gotta say  I don't think we have to mic the drums  I gotta say  Let's turn the mics on  The drums way the fuck down  Regardless  Regardless of the music being loud  Or something  That was pretty sloppy  Yeah  I gotta tell you  It was sloppy  That was sloppy  Oh boy  It knows this shit  I've heard  He used to be a drummer  I was never a drummer  Let's do Tom Sawyer then  Oh  Tom Sawyer  Of course 
[01:55:30]  Modern day warrior  Mimi's trying  Do you want to  Do you want to like  Turn up your headphone volume  I gotta play along to it  For a little bit  And then go  You gotta be able to play  Without the track though  Wouldn't you  Wouldn't you have to know  The drum part  You would think  Alright let's try Tom Sawyer  There you are  Here's Sal playing the drums  Oh boy  Amazing radio  I'm honestly worried  Of Mimi's trying  Against Tom Sawyer  Mimi's trying  The drum part 
[01:56:00]  Is not for him  Don't put him down  Is there again  Is there a fight in defense  Writing out the beans  And then  The drum is up  What you say about his company 
[01:56:30]  Is what you say about society  Can't believe  That's the victory  That's the victory  Can't believe  The world is 
[01:57:00]  The world is  Love and life are deep  Maybe as the skies  Hawaii  Yeah, tricky fights come up, so. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, he's falling apart. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, he's falling apart.  Oh, he's falling apart. 
[01:58:30]  I've met Neil Peart.  Sal, you're no Neil Peart.  I worked with Neil Peart.  I knew Neil Peart.  I didn't know all the patterns, honestly.  I can't be an asshole all the time.  I'm impressed because I can't do that shit.  Of course.  But he fucked it up in the middle of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He lost a little bit?  The truth of the matter is, that overall is a pretty easy Rush song because it's a pretty 
[01:59:00]  basic beat through the whole song.  There are a lot of fills and stuff, but you were missing a lot of fills.  And then coming out of the fills, your timing was so way off that you had to try to catch  back up again.  And you were the one that picked that song.  Yeah.  Why would you pick a song you didn't know well?  I don't know.  I just figured.  I don't know.  You have to pick a song that people know, you know?  You can't pick one that's too big. 
[01:59:30]  Drumming was supposed to be his thing, though.  Yeah.  He did all right.  I don't know how to do that shit.  It's John Bottom.  It's not ideal in here to, you know, have the vocal mics for drum overheads and stuff.  I'll play another one if you guys want to play another one.  Can you play Wipeout?  What do you mean?  What's maybe another band?  Wait, what's wrong with Wipeout?  Let me hear it.  What?  Wipeout?  It's like... 
[02:00:00]  It's just the whole song.  It's just that same thing.  No, I know that.  It's pretty bad.  Let's start with something basic for you.  How about In the Air Tonight?  The drum thing from In the Air Tonight.  Can you do that?  I brought a very abbreviated drum kit in here.  I couldn't even play half the shit that Neil was playing.  Oh, well, of course.  He has like 30 times.  He has the big fucking, yeah.  Excuse me.  Oh, yeah.  They come pouring in.  I love a good excuse.  But you picked a song.  Number four.  All right.  With the kit you have and your knowledge and everything, what would be a good song to showcase 
[02:00:30]  your drumming prowess instead of having to, you know, make an excuse?  Great question.  I don't know.  Maybe something from Muse would be cool.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Trying to get on the Opie teat.  Why not the In the Air Tonight thing?  I just literally don't even have the drums here to do that sort of thing.  Really?  But when it happens in the song, it's pretty impressive for everybody. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  People really get into that.  They get into the...  Let's do Muse Stockholm Syndrome, maybe?  All right.  All right.  People know this song.  Iraq, you got that?  They do know this song.  And I want to play the whole thing, so I'll just get, you know...  Oh, trust me, we don't want you to play the whole thing. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, we'll let you know when you've fucked up enough to stop.  Eric, turn it up very, very loud, please.  Oh, crank it.  Yeah, motherfucker.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  I won't stand in your way, let your head fall as you feel, as you show, as you breathe. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, it's a matter of time. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, it's a matter of time.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, God.  Yeah, God.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:03:00]  I remember it a little bit better, yeah.  Ah, that's what it was.  Sure. 
[02:03:30]  It was a lot simpler of a song.  Yeah.  But, yeah, okay.  I mean, the guy obviously can drum.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like he just set up a drum kit and went like, oh boy, now what do I do?  Right.  Oh shit, they got me.  He knows his way around a drum kit.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Do you want to play We Are the Dinosaurs?  What do you think of this?  He rogs a dinosaur.  He rogs a dinosaur. 
[02:04:00]  How did he get so fast?  Margin, Lord, he rogs a dinosaur.  He made the world fly.  Fucking guy.  All right, Sal.  There you go.  You better get those drums back before that guy gets all fucking annoyed.  Drum fever.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  It was fun.  It was all right.  I don't know.  It was fun.  It was all right.  Killed 10 minutes.  Good.  On a Monday.  I like when drummers want to play Rush, though.  That's Neil Peart, man. 
[02:04:30]  It always ends up like, ah, maybe that wasn't as good an idea as I thought.  I am a big Rush fan.  So that's why.  Can you do YYZ?  Are you a big Donna Summer fan?  The short, the beginning?  Yeah.  Do you know the, um.  Without the salt.  Yeah.  YYZ is, uh, that's Morse code in the beginning.  And YYZ is the airport code for, I think, the one in Toronto.  Yeah, that's where the bass drops.  So probably.  So probably.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. 
[02:05:00]  And the big Phil goes.  Sal's going to start soon.  That was actually the security guard throwing the drums out of the elevator.  Yeah, yeah.  We had a recording of that.  I didn't know.  And then the next big Phil is everybody's favorite.  Like, everybody in the audience is doing this.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he goes. 
[02:05:30]  It's funny.  It's one really fun thing to do at a Rush concert.  I'm playing some Rush there. 
[02:06:00]  Sal goes, one fun thing to do at a Rush concert.  I would, I would go with, uh, go get a beer when they break into Roll the Bones.  Oh.  Well, is that a fun thing to do at a Rush show?  Or, go get a beer.  You just, you turn around for, like, big hits, like, you know, in YYZ.  And you see everybody just, all these, like, you know.  Oh, the air drumming.  Everyone's air and drumming.  Air and drumming.  And you look at those guys, like, I could do that for real.  Right?  Well, no, you'd be surprised.  Like, a lot of the guys there, they're like, you know, older gentlemen.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  And they're all wearing, like, you know, Zildjian, DW. 
[02:06:30]  They're all wearing the same.  A lot of drummers.  A lot of drummers like to go see Rush.  That's for sure.  And they put on an amazing show.  It's a long-ass show.  And they have lots of, like, visuals, explosions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're still talking about drumming, I guess.  Oh, gosh.  All right.  Oh, pure evil.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sal.  Now, to break that in a while, that's pretty impressive, because I can't fucking do that.  Yeah.  I can't even come close to doing that shit. 
[02:07:00]  He's a drummer.  I've sat behind drums when no one's around and just tried to see what I could do.  Actually, fucking.  Yeah.  Not so much.  Yep.  All right.  Don't forget, Moses Gates is coming in.  The guy I filmed a few urban videos with, urban exploring videos with, he's got a new book called Hidden Cities.  And today's finally the day that we get to talk to him.  So I'm pretty excited to see him again.  And I haven't seen him since we went and did the underground exploring and then the Chrysler building exploring. 
[02:07:30]  I want to get his take on the fact that Homeland Security is calling this a form of terrorism.  They're helping terrorists out by showing them the weaknesses in the city's infrastructure.  Yeah.  Does that mean we're going to get a talking to?  A talking to?  Because if that happens, I'm not going to be winking at anybody.  No.  No.  There's going to be no winks.  No.  There's going to be no, I got this.  Well, I didn't get a drone talking to.  There's going to be no, I think I can just talk to Scott Greenstein and everything's okay. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  It'll be a different fucking version of me.  When it's Department of Homeland Security.  My knees will be shaking.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you've got to kind of take it seriously.  The drone people didn't talk to you?  No, no.  I didn't get any calls.  You would think they would have by now, right?  Knock on the door.  Nah.  I guess maybe they, you know, they knew.  They knew it wasn't me.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  So Moses comes in in about, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes.  Holy Moses.  You've got Michael Moore talking about guns.  You've got Jim Carrey doing an anti-gun song. 
[02:08:30]  You've got Bloomberg taking on the NRA.  Michael Moore is an idiot, obviously.  Want to start there?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me play the Michael Moore clip for you.  Yeah.  And then I'm going to sit back and do a Sudoku puzzle.  Does anyone have the Daily News today?  Where's the Sudoku puzzle?  Does anyone have the Daily News?  It's break time for the Opster.  Here's what Michael Moore said.  When was this and where?  Was it at some kind of fundraiser?  I thought it was on Piers Morgan.  Was it?  It wasn't. 
[02:09:00]  Did he say this on Piers?  I don't know.  All right.  He's been babbling it.  Do you realize that over 90% of the guns in this country are owned by white people in the suburbs and in rural areas?  90% of our guns are not owned by African Americans, Hispanics, minority groups.  They're owned by white people.  Now, what are these white people so afraid of out in the suburbs?  Are they thinking little redhead, freckle-faced Jimmy down the street is going to, you know, kill them, mug them?  I don't think so.  Are they afraid the guy next door is going to break in and steal their TV? 
[02:09:30]  No, because they know the guy next door makes $50,000, $60,000 a year.  So poverty and racism, the answer is pretty much the same answer for a lot of our other problems, jobs.  He's a fucking dickbag.  He is just a dickbag.  First of all, 90% of gun owners are what scared white people, as he said.  Oh, sorry, you forgot a word. 
[02:10:00]  Legal.  Legal gun owners.  Yeah, there you go.  Not all African Americans are Hispanic.  They're white people.  90% of the...  Yeah, exactly.  Registered, legal, legally purchased, legally held guns.  Now, when you throw in the illegal guns, I think the numbers are going to go up when you look at different races.  But Michael Moore, of course, doesn't want to say that.  What are the 90% of white gun owners that illegal gun owners are so scared of? 
[02:10:30]  Is it Jimmy next door?  Is it Johnny?  Is it the neighbors going to steal?  No.  What they're scared of is perhaps you're a mom strolling your 18-month-old child down the street and two African-American gentlemen want to rob you and shoot you in the leg and the side of your head and then just walk up to your baby and shoot him in the face and kill him.  Maybe that's what they're scared of. 
[02:11:00]  I don't know.  I know that's such a wild thing to say because something like that would never happen.  Oh, that's right.  It did.  Yeah.  I would say that it's not a scared thing, but it's like saying you drive around with a spare tire in your car because, whoa, 90% of the people that drive with spare tires are scared they're going to get a flat.  Nah, you got to be prepared.  I think preparedness is pretty good.  And the bottom line is it's a constitutional right, so shut the fuck up.  But his skewed stats are embarrassing. 
[02:11:30]  He's got an agenda that I don't even know where it comes from.  I don't know what his motivation is, what his endgame is to be doing nothing but making excuses for criminals and making villains out of the people that are paying attention to all the laws and exercising a constitutional right.  Why are they the bad guys and everyone that's using illegal guns and killing so many of the people that end up dead every year by gun violence are killed with illegal guns? 
[02:12:00]  The other ones that are killed with legal guns and a majority, more so than homicides, are suicides.  People that are killing themselves for whatever fucking reason that is.  But suicides are a huge part of the gun violence numbers that they jack up every year.  But they would like you to think that all those numbers are people with assault rifles going into schools.  That's pretty much it. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, 10,000 people died last year from gun violence.  And then they play up assault weapons and school shootings to try to make you think that's where it's all coming from.  Truth of the matter is, white people, it's suicides.  Black people, it's homicides.  That was a nice article was in one of the papers yesterday.  And they were showing that African-Americans are much more likely to be killed with a pistol, with a handguns and to kill with handguns. 
[02:13:00]  White people are much more likely than blacks to to commit suicide with guns.  Because, you know, that's just one of the stats.  But as far as being a scared person, little puppy, being a scared white person with a gun, no, it's being prepared.  He what's his what's his motivation?  Where is he looking to go with this making excuses for the criminals and making villains of the law abiding citizens? 
[02:13:30]  I don't know what Michael Moore is trying to do.  Sell more books, make another movie.  Oh, well, it's good business for him.  It's very good business.  So I guess that's what it is.  I think in the end, that's his first motivation.  Yeah.  With this whole thing.  Business is good for him.  He he likes to stir things up and infuriate people.  And I it's so hard for me to believe that that he actually believes what he's saying sometimes.  Because, I mean, I honestly don't think he's a stupid guy.  I don't know.  I just wish you guys got into it when he was in here. 
[02:14:00]  I do, too.  That would be pretty amazing.  I do, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would now.  Because it's really it's reached a much more higher boiling point right now.  But, yeah, every week he's saying something else that's really stupid.  I mean, look at look at your hometown of Flint, Michigan.  It's not just big business and greedy bosses that have destroyed that that city and Detroit, you know, and parts of Chicago. 
[02:14:30]  You know, look into it, you fat fuck.  And then I guess that baby story is horrendous.  It, it, it, it, it, it, she's strolling her kid.  She goes to get robbed.  What kind of neighborhood was it?  I don't know.  It's a shitty fucking neighborhood.  It was a shitty neighborhood to begin with.  Yeah.  It was in Atlanta.  Or in Georgia.  Somewhere in Georgia.  I really don't know.  Do they have the death penalty in Georgia?  I hope so.  And would that be a death penalty case?  I sure hope so.  I don't know what is a death penalty case in this country anymore.  At this point, yeah, what is it? 
[02:15:00]  I really don't know.  Two guys, they're 114, 117, youths, you know, teens, just out playing around.  They walk up to this woman strolling her kid and say, give me your money.  They point a gun at her.  She says, I don't have any money.  And they fire a round at the sidewalk next door.  She goes, please, I don't have any money.  They shoot her in the side of the head, in skin or ear, and then shoot her right above the kneecap.  And then she goes, please don't hurt my baby. 
[02:15:30]  And she goes, oh, yeah, you don't want us to kill your baby?  The guy walks right up to the kid's stroller, points the gun right at the kid's face, point blank, and pulls the fucking trigger.  And shoots an 18-month-old baby in the face.  And, you know.  Just horrible.  And you can't think that perhaps there's something more behind that?  That there's some type of complete lack of compassion and empathy and respect for life? 
[02:16:00]  What the fuck is going on?  I don't know.  Michael Moore sure doesn't know.  And scared white people owning guns?  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  But there's enough things going out there to concern people.  Perhaps they want to have as good of protection in their own home and walk in the streets as they could possibly have. 
[02:16:30]  Where when somebody walks up to you and threatens to shoot you and your baby in the face,  that perhaps you have at least a fighting chance to defend yourself and your child.  Instead of just laying on the ground with a bullet in your knee, weeping and begging these people that apparently have no clue what compassion is.  And you're depending on that person's compassion at that point to save your life and your baby's life because you don't have anything else. 
[02:17:00]  You don't have anything else to defend yourself with.  And if it was up to Michael Moore, none of us would ever have anything to defend ourselves against these animals with.  But, you know, odds are it would never happen to you.  I understand that.  Can't be a mental patient thinking around every corner is a danger.  But it's obvious things like this do happen, you know.  It happens more often than people win the lottery. 
[02:17:30]  And people play it all the time, hoping to win, you know.  So you need to be able to defend yourself.  And Bloomberg is also in the news about his gun rants.  And he would love it if the only recourse you had was to have the police show up after the fact and mop up.  Because perish the thought, again, that you're able to defend yourself.  And then fucking stupid, what's his name? 
[02:18:00]  Jim Carrey.  Jim Carrey.  Well, this is what Bloomberg had to say over the weekend.  Oh, bloomy.  Oh, boy.  Will you target people, Republicans and Democrats, who do not support a weapons ban, an assault weapons ban, who do not vote for background checks?  Will you spend money, lots of money, to target them in 2014, in the midterm race?  Well, let me phrase it this way.  I think I have a responsibility, and I think you and all of your viewers have responsibilities, to try to make this country safer for our families and for each other. 
[02:18:30]  And if I can do that by spending some money and taking the NRA from being the only voice to being one of the voices, so the public can really understand the issues, then I think my money would be well spent.  And I think I have an obligation to do that.  So you'll spend money on ads?  We're starting to run ads today or tomorrow.  I think I've spent $12 million on running ads in 10 states around the country, explaining to the public what the issues are and urging them to call their senators.  If they believe that we should have gun checks that stop criminals and people with mental illnesses from getting guns, they should call their senators. 
[02:19:00]  Would there be a political price to pay for a Republican or a Democrat who fails to vote based on this public polling to make assault weapons banned or to vote for background checks?  If 90% of the public wants something and their representatives vote against that, common sense says they are going to have a price to pay for that.  The public is going to eventually wake up and say, I want to put in office somebody that will do the things that I think are necessary for this country. 
[02:19:30]  That's what democracy is all about.  Well, that ain't happening.  No one's doing anything that the public wants at this point.  The one thing the public definitely wants is background checks, right?  It's over 80% at this point.  Yeah, a lot of people want background checks, whether they'll do anything or not.  And you can't tie background checks to gun registration.  In a lot of states, that's what's going to happen. 
[02:20:00]  It's very tricky.  It's not as easy as it sounds.  But background checks, it doesn't stop the criminal.  You fucking assholes.  It doesn't stop the criminal.  And what Bloomberg is saying also, I love this stat.  90% of America wants gun control.  It's like 90% want some form of gun control, whether it's background checks or whether it's completely banning guns. 
[02:20:30]  There are certain amounts of people that want that.  Background checks, a lot of people want background checks.  Sure, put it to a vote, fine.  Assault weapon bans, they don't have the votes.  The Democrats know they don't even have the votes 100% in their party.  So that isn't going to happen.  But you talk to Bloomberg, and he says, well, let's give the people what they want.  The people don't want an assault weapons ban.  But he's still pushing it. 
[02:21:00]  So why is that okay to push, even though the people don't want it?  What is the percentage of people that want it?  That want an assault weapons ban?  Yeah.  I'm not sure of the numbers, but they can't win the vote.  They don't have the numbers.  No, I mean...  Oh, the American people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's not 50%.  It's not 50%, that's for sure.  Considering there's millions of these things in almost every home in the country.  It's 56%, Denver Pest says. 
[02:21:30]  Could you please give me a source?  Is it fucking MSNBC.com poll?  That's like saying Fox poll.  56% of the people want an assault weapons ban?  Want an assault weapons ban.  That seems high.  I don't know if that's...  And here's another thing, though.  Yeah.  The people that want something banned are the least educated about it.  I've noticed over this gun fucking issue that the people that want to ban things, take things away, stricter controls, are the least educated people on guns that I've ever spoken to about any topic. 
[02:22:00]  They just parrot what they're hearing about guns.  They don't know what a semi-automatic and an automatic are.  They don't know that there is a difference between what the military uses and what a civilian can get and use.  They go, there's no place for military rifles in the hands of private citizens.  There aren't...  Don't worry about it.  We're talking about a semi-automatic rifle that looks like a military rifle. 
[02:22:30]  It acts like any wooden-stocked hunting rifle that your granddad would have.  It fires rounds as quickly as you pull the trigger, just like many people's hunting rifles, just like your World War II fucking rifle that was given to your GI, your M1.  But it looks cool because it's got black plastic on it and looks like when you see a show on TV about the war, and then you look at one of these guns, it looks the same. 
[02:23:00]  So you ban them.  They have no place in the hands of private citizens.  Well, if you were educated on guns, you would know that that isn't the same gun they're using in combat.  And most crimes and murders are done with handguns, not assault weapons.  So stop with the assault weapon ban.  It's 300 people a year in the country are killed by rifles in any way, shape, or form.  That includes hunting accidents. 
[02:23:30]  That includes bolt-action rifles, not just assault weapons.  It's probably the lowest casualty rate of any type of firearm in the country.  It's not concealable.  It's a stupid thing to take around with you.  Pistols.  That's where it's at.  But again, it's illegal guns for the most part, and they don't want to address that.  I mean, you know, I'm sure if you question that fucking animal that shot that baby in the face, 
[02:24:00]  I don't think he's worried that his pistol license is going to be taken away.  I don't think he's quite worried about how he's going to renew his pistol license after shooting a baby in the face.  That's a sick story.  And then Jim Carrey, yeah, our Canadian friend.  He's having a little fun with the whole thing.  Canadians, just stay out of the Second Amendment fight.  Whether you were here for years or not, you got that Canadian fucking gene in you  that has no clue what it's like to really be an American and to exercise constitutional rights. 
[02:24:30]  Go back up to your nanny state and be taken care of up there with your shitty health care.  Even though it's free, it's shitty.  But it's on Funny or Die.  He's just having fun.  Oh, fuck him.  He's kind of just having fun.  I've seen his tweets that aren't meant for fun.  He's just trying to have fun with the whole gun debate.  He's an asshole.  He's injecting some humor into the topic, into the subject.  Cold Dead Hand with Jim Carrey.  Yeah.  And he intros it as Charlton Heston. 
[02:25:00]  This is just fun.  Oh, okay.  There's some lofts in here.  All right.  Well, hi-o and howdy, fine folks.  And welcome back to Hee Haw.  We want to thank our special guest, Charlton Heston, for joining us.  Walter, it's an absolute pleasure to be here in the sight of God.  On Hee Haw.  But who would be laughing if it weren't for the patriots who answer the call of freedom?  Well, I'm...  The aliens. 
[02:25:30]  They would exploit our every weakness and suck the brains out of every living soul.  They'd be laughing.  But not like you and me.  That's a good Heston.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Well, we want to leave you with the sweet as molasses sounds of a band I'm sure you're all going to like.  Hens and Roosters, lend an ear to Lonesome Earl and the Clutterbusters. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, what happened?  And then he plays the song.  Is it buffering?  No.  No, he's playing off the audio.  I think it would stop there.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.  And then the song's called Cold Dead Hands.  I like his Heston.  It's pretty funny.  See, I told you there's humor here.  Just fun.  Oh, I know.  He's still a dick bag.  Pay attention.  The members of his band all were assassinated. 
[02:26:30]  Assassinated.  Bullets.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, who's he got?  He's got Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln.  He took a bullet.  John Lennon.  Sure, Lennon got one.  Gandhi.  Gandhi.  That's his band.  That's why India doesn't have Halloween.  Because they got no Gandhi.  Oh.  We should have just let the song play.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  I've never heard that one before.  Yeah, hopefully you'll never hear it again.  OMG. 
[02:27:00]  I was only joking.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Some folks ride like the wind  With the whispering pines to guide them  And the burning light inside them  Keeps them warm in the snow 
[02:27:30]  Others fear the sounds they hear  Make banditles out on molehills  Fill their hearts with four cute pine quills  They're dead and brave long before they go  Charlton Heston movies are no longer in demand  And his immortal soul may lay forever in the sand  The angels wouldn't take him up to heaven like he planned 
[02:28:00]  Cause they couldn't pry that gun from his cold, dead hand  What did he say?  It takes a cold, dead hand  To decide to pull the trigger  Takes a cold, dead heart  And as near as I can figure  With your cold, dead  Ain't not trying to prove your dick is bigger  But we know  Your chariot may not be swinging low  I hate goof songs that sound so beautiful 
[02:28:30]  That it's  It just sounds like a regular song  It just sounds like a nice regular song  Sounds like a regular song  He's saying little dicks  Yeah, I know  People with guns  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I know  All the features in there  He's just having fun  He's having a good time  Injecting some humor  Oh, he's not just having fun  No, he's just having fun  He absolutely  He doesn't have an attorney  He's just having a good time  He's putting out a little propaganda there  What's it about, the politics or the comedy?  I think it's about  Politics or contraband  The smuggler's blue 
[02:29:00]  I think it's just about having a little fun  A little fun  Lighting it up a little bit  Cold at hand  Cold at hand  Cold at hand  Cold at hand  You're a big, big man  With a little mini glance  So you need something bigger  Just to fill  They're making fun of everything I hold dear  Walter  Imagine if the Lord were here  And he knew  Do you want to play the whole thing? 
[02:29:30]  No  Okay  No  You don't like it, Ant?  It's fucking  I mean, it's a song parody  It's fucking  At least he's not shoehorning  You know, it's a well-written song  It sounds accurate to the time and style that he's trying to portray  Old-style country music 
[02:30:00]  But, you know, he's just putting his drivel in there  Oh, wow, really?  If you like guns, you have a small dick  Oh, I get it  Are you going to stereotype a black guy  And say, oh, black guy's got big dicks  Why don't you put that in your song?  Huh?  The one  But that doesn't make sense  Because young black men  Right  Are using illegal guns in record numbers  Killing each other  And they're supposed to have big dicks  So I don't understand what Jim Carrey's going for there  Yuck 
[02:30:30]  Jim Carrey  Try to make another movie  Yeah, give that a whirl  He makes movies  He makes shitty movies now  What was the last good movie from Jim Carrey?  Cable Guy  Wow, really?  Cable Guy  What about the Penguin movie?  Fuck it  Mr. Popper's Penguins?  Yeah, what about that one?  Fucking stunk on ice  What about  After two weeks  Burt Wonderstone  Has barely made half of its production budget  Burt Wonderstone  Looked like a lump of shit  I saw it  It wasn't that bad  Stop it  It was bad, right?  It wasn't terrible 
[02:31:00]  I mean, it wasn't great  But it wasn't, you know  Yeah, I don't go to those  They weren't that bad movies  Yeah, there's no reason to run out  I only go for the really over-the-top ones now  That's the only time  You'll see me in a movie theater  I don't go for the ones that are like  Ah, it wasn't that bad  Yeah  I do all my research ahead of time  So I avoid those scenarios  Yeah  Going back to Bloomberg really fast  Because he's always about  This is what the people want  The people want  And I'm not even sure if that's what the people want  To be completely honest with you  I'd have to study the stats  Sure  But one thing that people don't want 
[02:31:30]  Is higher taxes  But that doesn't seem to stop Mayor Bloomberg  Or any other politician  No, they love Jacksonville  So if it's about what the people want  How about we start there?  Because I know for sure  People don't want higher taxes  Well, that's why they have a progressive tax scale  Here in this country  Because people don't want higher taxes  On themselves  But they love raising taxes  On other people  Well, that's  So if you campaign to a base 
[02:32:00]  And say, well, people want  These services that we give in this country  So we have to tax  And we're going to tax these people  And then everyone goes  Yay!  But the problem is  Everyone is paying higher taxes  Of course  Yeah  And  Everyone is  Yeah  It's amazing how much  When Bill Maher starts bitching  About his tax rate  You know there's trouble  Because he will lap the ass  Of a liberal Democrat  I want this quote to go out there 
[02:32:30]  I want to make an announcement  People don't want higher taxes  Yeah  Mr. Bloomberg  Yeah  Mr. Bloomberg  And people want their sugary drinks  Remember that one?  Yeah  You're all about what the people want  Well, I'm sure people want  To continue drinking their sugary large drink  Yeah  Yeah  And how about you let people  Our baby had been hitting the head  How about you let people  Protect themselves  And defend themselves  I want the safety 
[02:33:00]  For the people  A safe  How safe do you think that woman was?  Strolling her little kid down the street  With no chance of defending herself  Against  Thug  Animals  I think Kid Rock said it best  What did Kid Rock say?  Ba-wa-da-ba-da-bang-a-dang  Diggy-diggy-diggy  Said the boogie  Certainly for the same song  Oh  Get in the pit  And try to love someone  Oh  That's so sweet 
[02:33:30]  We need more of that  Yeah, there is no pit  There is no love  It's a  Get in the pit  It's a horrible world we live in  Horrible world we live in  Let's watch out for the methadone clinics  Yeah  That's where the scale of people are  He's got all his  All his friends down there  That's right  People  Yeah  Hookers in Hollywood  Yeah  The critics  The cynics  That's right  You've played that song a few times  Oh  You know what  On that one stage that really rocks 
[02:34:00]  Really rocks  Yeah  It's all good  It's all it's fun  They get in the pit  And try to love someone  This was such a turn to fucking  Crank your fucking stereo  In your vehicle  Well the wife and the kids  Didn't enjoy it as much as I did  On the way to Philly  That's for sure  Yeah  Everyone was trying to sleep  And I decided it was Kid Rock time  The methadone clinic  Where did Kid Rock go wrong? 
[02:34:30]  He didn't go wrong  I was having the discussion this weekend  Yeah  Guy's a fucking talented guy  I know he is  But he's done three or four different fucking music genres  He's incredibly talented  He had crazy rock cred  Well he had rap  He had rap rock  Then he had rock  Then he had country  Then he had pop  What happened was  He tried to be a rapper  At the same time as Vanilla Ice  And that didn't work  Oh man  Yeah he was  There can only be one king  No he was legit  White rap guy  Yeah  And then he threw the metal shit in there 
[02:35:00]  But what happened was  When the rock rap thing  Became stupid  Because of Limp Bizkit  Because of Limp Bizkit  He went  Like Obie said  Country  And like  Southern Rocky  Almost  But more than pulled it off  I know he samples and shit  But I like all those dumb catchy songs of his  But so he survived  So he was  Because he was changing up his sound  So what do you mean by going wrong?  He did that Sheryl Crow picture  He's probably saying  I think it's Sheryl Crow  Yeah but he's selling more 
[02:35:30]  I mean it depends  Like maybe  For your taste  He went wrong  But I think he's selling way more fucking  Selling more than Fred Durst is right now  He's selling way more albums  Doing like the Sheryl Crow thing  And the country thing  Than he did with the bar  With the bar  The bang  It just seems like he fell off  He fell off  Tell him in Detroit  Yeah  They love him in the deed  Oh well  Well I think he finally fell off a little bit  But he had easily a 10 year run  Easy  Easy  That's a long career for these guys nowadays  This was huge 
[02:36:00]  I love this song  At first I want to hate it  Because of the Leonard Skinner sample  Yeah  This was a big one  What was that  I just remember  It was Summer of Nicolini  Yeah  I think that was  It's going to ramp up  Moses Gates next  Stay there  It was 1989  I rap baby  My thoughts were short  My hair was long  Caught somewhere between  Airboy and man  She was 17  And she was far from in between 
[02:36:30]  It was summertime  In northern Michigan  Splashing through the sandbar  Talking about a campfire  It's the simple things in life  Like when and where  We didn't have no internet  But man I never will forget  The way the moonlight shined upon her head 
[02:37:00]  And we were trying different things  And we were smoking funny things  Making love out by the lake  To our favorite song  Sipping whiskey out the bottle  Not thinking about tomorrow  Singing sweet home Alabama  All summer long  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show  The Opie and Anthony Show  This is the Opie and Anthony Show 
[02:37:30]  Tell us great stories  But he doesn't want to be on the air  We'll talk about that tomorrow or something  We got my new friend Moses Gates in studio  Hey how you doing man  It's MosesNYC on Twitter  And of course he's the author of Hidden Cities  Travels to the secret corners  Of the world's greatest metropolises 
[02:38:00]  A memoir of urban exploration  It's on Amazon  Barnes & Noble  iBookstore  Books a million  And IndieBound  Damn that's like  It's going to be a big book  That's for real  I hope so  A lot of people are pre-ordering  Just because of the videos we made  Yeah that was a crazy time man  That was a fun day  Yeah that's  I finally said it  I think it was last week  I posted three videos  It was all in one day  That we did all that shit  Yeah  And we were on the ground  For at least two and a half hours 
[02:38:30]  Yeah because that's a  It was about a three mile walk  And we stopped a little bit  So I think that was like  A four or five hour day  I would think even longer  But yeah  I was going to say  Five or six hours  But I found out that  Moses was coming in  And Roland goes  Hey man he's more than willing  To show you around a little bit  I'm like fuck yeah  And the one thing  I always wanted to see  Was where mole people was filmed  Yeah  Not mole people  Oh fuck I forgot the name of it  Dark Days  Dark Days  Thank you 
[02:39:00]  Thank you  Thank you  The black and white movie  And it so happens  It's relatively close to where I live  And I've walked that area  A ton of times  Near the water  And all of a sudden man  You know I show him  Moses goes  Alright meet me by the statue  Statue Eleanor Roosevelt  Yeah it was all creepy  Yeah like I was in  In the middle of some  Like game of clue or something  Meet me at the statue  Well it's no fun  If you know  We just needed a coffee shop  Right  Right  And then I like  I just trusted you  Because of Roland  I didn't know him 
[02:39:30]  And all of a sudden  I meet him at the statue  And there's Moses  I'm like alright  I'm expecting flashlights  And all sorts of shit  We did have one flashlight  But he didn't check the battery  So we're underground  For three hours in the dark  I'm like  Oh man  We could have used a flashlight  Oh shit  So you gotta read the book  Because there's at least  Three times in the book  Where I forget a flashlight  So you would know  That would seem to be  Number one thing  Wouldn't that be  The number one thing  Number one thing is you  Right  Like yourself  Right  Second thing  The flashlight 
[02:40:00]  So you can see  In a way it was cool  That we didn't have a flashlight  Because a lot of times  We were walking  And it was pitch dark  And remember the one moment  I almost fell into a fucking hole  Yeah you gotta watch for that  There's holes  Like big fucking holes down there  And there just happened to be  Light in this area  We were walking  Just chatting  You know bullshit  And all of a sudden  I'm like holy fuck  We almost walked into  This pretty impressive hole  There was one time  This is a long time ago  I was in an old abandoned courthouse  And I just fell backwards  Down a hole  Just like 
[02:40:30]  Really  Bang  Yeah  Wow  Fell about like  Seven or eight feet  Got up  Hurt to breathe  Got on the number two train  Checked myself into  Harlem General  Right  Waited a couple hours  In the emergency room  And you know  I ended up okay  But you always gotta pay attention  That's the point  Right  Holy shit  Where was that courthouse?  On 163rd and Boston Road  Up in the Bronx  Is it still something  You could like check out?  I don't think so  Because they're redeveloping it  I mean it's this beautiful 
[02:41:00]  Beautiful old courthouse  And it was abandoned  I want to say since the 1970s  But I'm not sure  And they've been redoing it  They've been rehabilitating it  I think it's going to be  A community center  I'm not 100% sure  But that whole area  Has been built up a lot  What did you get to see in there  Before you fell backwards?  Like have you been to any  Of the downtown courthouses?  Or any of  You know  Just an old courthouse downtown  I've been in an active one  Yeah exactly  A few active ones  Over the years  Imagine that  And there's a 
[02:41:30]  There's a real  Cool statue  Up on top also  So just imagine  Like one of those  Old beautiful courthouses  With the staircases  And the railings  And everything like that  But just empty  Wow  There were also  Jail cells in there too  Really?  Yeah in the basement  And also I think  On the fourth floor  You feel like you're  Walking through like  Silent Hill or something  Yeah like  One of those  Creepy video games  Right  So we went  Where Dark Days was filmed  Where the mole people  Used to live  And that's below  I guess  The West Side Highway 
[02:42:00]  More or less  Yeah like  Underneath Riverside Park  Riverside Park really  And you could kind of  See the West Side Highway  Through some of these  Gates that open up  Yeah it's crazy  Because you're down there  And you can hear people  Like walking their dog  Above you  Yeah wow  We saw one  We yelled to them  I was like oh great  If fucking Moses  Was a serial killer  I'm fucked right now  Somebody was getting  A Frisbee or something  And I didn't know  I thought people  Still lived on the ground  I finally learned  That that's pretty much  Not true anymore 
[02:42:30]  There's a few stragglers  Here and there  But in general  People aren't living  Underground in that area  Yeah no that's correct  Because what happened  Was that was an active  Rail line for decades  It was a freight line  Like you know  The high line right  Yeah  So the high line  Used to connect  To that rail line  And it would take freight  From the Bronx  Or from upstate  Down to the meatpacking district  And that was the whole purpose  And the high line  For the people outside New York  They made it into  A walking park  It's really cool  You know railroads  Are obviously above ground  But they made it  It's really a nice little thing 
[02:43:00]  To check out  If you come to New York  So anyway  They decommissioned that  As a freight line  In I believe 1980  And then that entire tunnel  Was abandoned  From 1980 until the 1990s  What a great time  Yeah  When they started running  Hamtrak through it  Yeah  Yeah so that was just  A giant wide open space  And it was perfect  For people to just go  Chill down there  And with you know  Crack and  Like the perfect timing  Right  The gritty  Dirty New York  And everything  Shit  Shanty towns 
[02:43:30]  Popped up  Something crazy down there  How many people  Live down there  At its height  I mean nobody really knows  My best guess  Would be a couple hundred  But I'm not  That was it  I'm not the guy  That asked  I wasn't there back then  Yeah  I mean stuff gets exaggerated  Right  Right  Yeah but then we  You know  We popped down  One of these holes  Yep  And then this whole world  Opened up  It was so cool  I mean  I'm not going to lie  I was trying to be cool  But as soon as you said  We're going down this hole  I was like  I was ready to bail  I'm like no fucking way 
[02:44:00]  And he found  And the first hole we found  Was just  Not just garbage  Like horrendous garbage  Really  Like almost sewagey garbage  He's like  Oh this is the only one  I can find today  Because these holes pop up  Yeah  And then you know  The city takes  You know  Does  Covers them up  And then they just  Find another one  You know  They make another one  I do give you props  For meeting a strange man  In a park  And following him  Down a hole in the ground  Though  Wouldn't be the first time  Everybody will do that  Hole  So we found a hole 
[02:44:30]  And  There you go  I went to Moses  You first  He went through  He's got to lead the way  Sure  Poked his head  I was like  This is a good one  Because he didn't even know  He didn't know  If we were going to  Just drop straight down  He's like  No it's a good one  Come on down  That's when I learned  That I had forgotten  The flashlight  And that my batteries  Were out  Oh nice  Yeah  So you just  Fussed around a while  And then we're like  It'll probably be fine  Let your eyes adjust  And just kind of  Walk around  It's dark down there  Man  Yeah  And then like 
[02:45:00]  The greats  From above  Give you some light  And that's where  All that cool artwork  Was that you were  Showing me  Yeah  There's a bunch  Of great artwork  Down there  And Ed Koch  I can't remember  If you were there  On that trip  Or if it was  A different trip  No I know what you're going to say  Yeah but Ed Koch  Died Friday morning  And we were there  On a Sunday afternoon  And somebody had already  Painted a rest in peace  Ed Koch graffiti  Really  Yeah  It was really cool  In the darkness  And now it's an active  Railroad obviously 
[02:45:30]  Yeah Amtrak  Amtrak runs through there  Now  And we saw  I think three or four  And at one point  We thought it was  One of those slow moving  Fucking trains  Like it was like  Some people that were  Going to get us  In fucking trouble  You even panicked  I saw it on your face  Like oh fuck  This is something  We don't really see  I mean I try to play it cool  But I'm always really nervous  On these things  Right  Right right  I would think  Yeah  You're getting  Nailed  Some people  Some people are just  Some people just  Don't give a fuck  Some people are just like 
[02:46:00]  On we go  We're good  I'm always really nervous  And have to try to like  Kind of play it cool  Well some like that  Is one thing  But the  The Chrysler building  That seemed like  A little more  You could get in  Pretty big trouble for  I mean I disagree  I mean I don't know  I mean while we're  On the radio  Talking about it  I guess we'll find out  But it's like  You know  It's all above board  You know  There's nothing shady  So I don't know  I don't know  It's just  The floor is just empty  I read  Recently 
[02:46:30]  An article was put out  About  People saying  That urban explorers  Were helping terrorism  That's a silliest thing  The weaknesses  I mean that's  That's the silliest thing  In the world  Man  It's like one of those  Things where like  It's 2013  Folk like  If you like  Think you're going to  Put the internet  Back in a box  It's not going to happen  You know  So it's  You know  The MTA  Has an official  Twitter feed  Where they have  Photos of the tunnels  You know 
[02:47:00]  You can go to the library  And get architectural plans  For everything  Like it's just  Stuff is out there  It's a much better tack  To take  To teach people  About the city  And teach them  Like here is  What's where  How you can get  Out of places  In an emergency  It's much better  To have more knowledge  Rather than less knowledge  What Moses is saying  He thinks everyone  Should have the opportunity  To stand on that eagle head  And apply it to the top  Of the spire  Where no one has ever been  Or very few people  Have ever been  That's pretty fucked up  I was watching that 
[02:47:30]  I was looking at that  That's crazy  The spire is cool  I made a mistake  Though that's not  And I got called out for it  On I think the YouTube comments  Or something  Where all that concrete stuff  That's like fireproofing  Right  Right  And I messed that up  In the video  So take the opportunity  Don't worry about it  But we leave the underground tunnel  We didn't get to run  Into the cat lady  Who's still living down there  I wanted to talk to her  What's her name again?  Brooklyn  Brooklyn  There's a lady named Brooklyn  That has how many cats?  A lot  Oh man  Like a lot  Like dozens? 
[02:48:00]  I would say dozens  Would be accurate  Dozens of cats  She lives down there  Full time  And the only reason  I bring this up  Moses and his pals  Before he took me around  They spent the night  Down there  With her  Right  For her birthday  Or something  Yeah  So this was  That's fucked up  Yeah  You can read about it  In the New York Times  My buddy Steve  Was doing a big  Underground trip  That he did a lot more  Than just that tunnel  But I just joined him  For just the night  In the tunnel  With a few other  Friends of mine  And yeah 
[02:48:30]  It was fun  We had a party  It's  If you look up  I think it's called  The Wilderness  Beneath Your Feet  On the New York Times  It documents it  It's got the whole story  Right  I would just think  With something like  The Chrysler building  People would be afraid  You know  I mean that's an  Iconic building  That maybe some  Shenanigans up there  Would go on  And you know  People  Because you try  To get into this building  You're hoping  They're going to talk to us  No no no  I'm just saying  You go into this building 
[02:49:00]  And security is crazy  Right  It would seem to me  Like God  Why wouldn't there be  More security  You think  Well I just want to  Walk people through it  So then  We jump in a cab  We're way up near Harlem  When we finally got out  Of the tunnel  We walked  You said three miles  On the ground  Two and a half  Two and a half miles  On the ground  Finally got out  Where you get out  Without really giving  It away to everybody  And the only people  We saw were other people  Exploring by the way  Down there  Yeah  Every time I go  I run into other folks  Taking pictures  Or doing whatever  Not many  I'm in a handful  I guess  Every time you're down there 
[02:49:30]  And then we jump in a cab  He goes  I got something really cool  But I don't want to tell you  I'm like alright  I guess I gotta trust you  Even though I've only known you  Three hours  Come on  You know we bonded  In the tunnel  We did alright  And then we're in the cab  And then I see the Chrysler building  Coming up  I'm like holy fuck  I think we're going to  The fucking Chrysler building  No fucking way  What am I allowed to say?  Nothing  Okay  Well then  All I'm saying is  I'll say this  Then we arrive  It's obvious  We're going into the Chrysler building 
[02:50:00]  And I could say this much  We got in the building legit  I can say that  Yeah absolutely  We weren't breaking any laws  I don't know what laws  We broke officially that day  But I certainly know  We didn't like  Illegally enter the Chrysler building  Yeah I don't think any actually  Yeah I mean the 61st floor is just empty  That amazes me  The 61st floor is obviously  The old observational deck  Or observation deck  No the old observation deck  Is 71  And that's actually  Oh you know what  I got confused by that too  Yeah the old observation deck 
[02:50:30]  Was all indoors  It's on 71  It's a private office now  61 it was just  An office building  And it was  There was a lawyer's office  Wait the one with the Eagles heads  What floor is that?  61  Oh  Oh so they have an observation deck  They used to  It closed in I think 1945  Oh I thought where we were  Was the observation deck  That was closed in 1945  Why wouldn't that be  The observation deck  With the Eagles right there?  I don't know  They should make it  An observation deck  Because you can walk  Outside there  They will make more money  Than if they rent it out  As an office  And they will especially 
[02:51:00]  Make more money  Than if they just keep it empty  Like I  If I would totally make that  Into an active observation deck  Would be like so great  Now I want to know  What's on the 71st floor  71st floor is  I forget what kind of office is there  But it's a private office  It looks kind of the same  As the other floor  Because the observation deck  I just assumed  Was the floor with the Eagles  Because that all would make sense  You go outside  You take the pictures  Near the Eagles  I think it would be  The coolest thing in the world  I would definitely pay $10 
[02:51:30]  To go out there  Maybe even $20  Who knows  So then we got up to  Alright so that was 61  We got up to 61  It's an empty office  And I couldn't believe it  I was like  You've got to be kidding me  This whole floor is empty  And it's just me and him  And these iconic Eagles  I mean it's a great place  The last time I was there  They're doing work on it  So I'm pretty sure  It's going to be rented up soon  If it's not already  Wow they were working on it  Yeah they had  You went back after I went  I've been up there  A few times  Since  Yes I think so 
[02:52:00]  Yeah I mean  I've lost track  But yeah  Wow  And then  You know  I'm taking a look around  Outside  When we got outside  And the guardrail's  Not too high  That was a little freaky  Yeah but it's fine  No I was alright  I was alright with that  And then I'm just kind of  Taking a look around  Checking it out  Going holy fuck  I can't believe I'm checking this out  And then I turn  To my left  And you're just like  Sitting on the eagle's head  Without even telling me  Well yeah  I mean  What's the point of like 
[02:52:30]  Going 99% of the way there  And then not going all the way  But why would you want me to  Like film that at first  I mean we did some things afterwards  But I'm like  This is so no big  My point is  It was such a no big deal to you  That you just walked out there  You didn't need to get my attention  Or anything  You're like  Ah I'm here  I love being here  I'm going to go sit out  On the eagle's head  For a little while  While he takes a look around  Yeah  Yeah  I mean it makes perfect sense  Like think of it this way  Right  You have this table here  This table is made 
[02:53:00]  This like part right here  Is maybe the size  Of the eagle's head  Even like  You  If I told you  Jump up and stand  On this table  Right  Yeah  You'd be like  Whatever  No big deal  But we all understand  How that works  You know  I'm able to ride a bike  On a sidewalk  Without ever thinking  I'm going to veer off  And you know  Right  Hit the grass  Right  But if you put that  Over the Grand Canyon  Yeah  Put a floating sidewalk  Above the Grand Canyon  I'd be fucking  You would lose  Nine out of ten people  Easy  Yes  Even though they would never 
[02:53:30]  Yeah yeah  Well that made the point  So  So we're on 61  Checking out the eagles  And then  And then  That's what Moses said to me  I think we can go higher today  I'm like  What  Now what  Yeah  So we get up to  We get up to  The crown  I guess  And it's  Yeah but how  The triangular  The triangular windows  Yeah right  But  So we're on 61  I think the elevator  Ended more or less  A little further up  Right  But we didn't use  Elevators at that point  We were just kind of  Walking the stairs  The stairs ends where 
[02:54:00]  The stairs ends at  I believe  76  I'm fairly sure  Is the highest  Actual floor  And then after  76 stories  Yeah  And then after that  It's just like  Ladders  And you gotta  Haul yourself up  Through a couple  Of crossbeams  At times  It's just  Kind of  Monkeying around  I'm not gonna  Lie to you  We were in  A certain area  Around 76  I'll say  And it looked like  We were at a dead  End  And I was kind of  Relieved  I was like  Alright good  I got some  Cool footage  I know I got  A video or two 
[02:54:30]  Out of this  This day  Let's get the  Fuck out of here  And then of course  This guy  Always is trying to  The little I know  About you  But I figured it out  He's like  No man  I can't give up  Now  I'm here  I gotta see  If there's anything  Else I can do  Before I  You know  Call it a day  And he did a  Couple moves  That I was just  Like what  The fuck  And next thing  You know  Well you know  His head is  Popping over the  Side going  Hey meet me  Over here  I'll just say  That  Legit  But I mean  I don't  I'm  And that's  That was the  Floor where my  Video starts 
[02:55:00]  Where now we  Have to climb  The ladders  I mean  I'm an okay  Climber  But I'm not  A professional  Rock climber  Or anything  You know  Like I'm  Fairly in shape  And can make  A couple moves  But like  I've been  Places  Like I was  With my friend  Timmy O'Neill  Who's a  Like a really  Great professional  Rock climber  And he's  Like I've been  You when I'm  With him  Where he's  Just like  Climbing around  Buildings and  Shit  And I'm  Just like  But it's  Just he  Knows he can  Do it  He's comfortable  With it 
[02:55:30]  So I don't  Freak out  How do they  Access to  Some of those  Antennas and  Electronics up  There for  Maintenance  Well I mean  That's the  Thing right  All of these  Places are  Places that  Human beings  Have to go  For maintenance  For repair  For whatever  Like that  So there's  Always a  Way to get  There  Yeah  Yeah  But some  I have a  Friend of  Mine also  Who works  On a  Telephone  Repair  And you  Know  It's the  Same  He's always  Telling me  I should go  Be a  Telephone  Pole  Repairman  Or something  Like that  Or a  Cell phone  Antenna 
[02:56:00]  Repairman  You're not  Scared of  Heights at  All  Not really  I'm pretty  Good with  Heights  I mean  It doesn't  Freak me out  Now  Thanks to  You I  Now get  Anxiety  I feel so  Bad  I didn't  Know I  Was  No I  Was never  That guy  But since  I filmed  You on  The Eagle  I've just  Seen you  I'll tell  You to  Your face  I've seen  You fall  A million  Times as  I'm trying  To go to  Sleep at  Night  All right  I just  See how  It could  Easily  Happen  Has  This  Affected  His  Performance  At  Work  In the  Morning  Is he  All right  No I  Think he's  Okay  No it's

[03:00:30]  Formed at  The intersection  Of the  Moscow River  And the  Naglinka  River  And then  They put  The Naglinka  River  Underground  So we  Decide to  Go through  The Naglinka  River  And we're  Out kind of  At the  Outskirts of  The ring road  And we pop  A manhole  And the guy  We're with  Is like  You know  Dressed in  This like  Semi-official  Looking vest  And I'm like  Is this cool  Are people  Going to  Stress  And he's  Like no  No  The only  Time people  Care about  Anything  Is by  The Kremlin  With the  Special  Government  Police  And we're  Like okay  Fine  So we go  Down into  The tunnel  And we're  Walking along 
[03:01:00]  And it's  I think  Like maybe  A couple  Of miles  And we  Get to  The end  And we've  Walked right  Under red  Square  Come on  I swear to  God  That's  Impossible  Shit  So we're  Under red  Square  We come  To the  Outflow  And it's  Kind of  Raining a  Little bit  Just like  A little  Bit  And for  Those of  You  Contemplating  Draining or  Going underground  Or whatever  The like  Number one  Cardinal rule  Is do not  Go in drains  If it's  Raining or  Gonna rain  Because you  Will  Completely  Die  Really  Yeah 
[03:01:30]  Because everything  Even if it's  Only a little  Trickle  Everything that  Hits cement  Is eventually  Going to roll  Into the gutter  And then go  Into a small  Drain and then  Go into the  Big collector  Drain where  You are  So you know  Your drain  Is let's  Say eight  Feet by  Eight feet  That is  Not large  Enough to  Handle the  Runoff for  An area of  Like acres  Around you  That's coming  At you  So if you're  In a drain  When it  Rains  You're just  You know  The water  Level  Levels  Just  So we  Start to  Kind of  Freak out  We're like  We got  To get  Out of  Here  We run 
[03:02:00]  Back  And the  First manhole  We come  To is  Right by  I want to  Say the  Bolshoi  Theater  It's like  The theater  That's right  By the  Kremlin  And the  Guy  We're with  Is like  Okay  This is  Like the  Worst  Way  To get  Out  But  We're  Just  Going to  Pop the  Manhole  We're  Going to  Scurry out  And we're  Going to  Hope nobody's  Around  In  Russia  Oh man  Come on  I can see  If it's in  I don't know  Cleveland or  Something  Yeah  So we're  Like okay  Fuck  So we  Pop the  Manhole  We scurry 
[03:02:30]  Out  There's like  I think  I think  That there's  Five or  Six of  Us  And we're  Right by  This huge  Statue of  Karl Marx  So we  Sit  So we  Go out  We put  The thing  In the  In the  Ground  Nobody else  Is around  We're like  Thank god  We made  It  We're okay  We sit  Down by  The  Karl  Instead of  Getting the  Fuck out  Of there  Which is  Like what  You always  Always  Always  Should do  We just  Decide to  Like hang  Out and  Be happy  With ourselves  And like  We're all  Wearing  Like rubber  Boots  And hip  Waiters  And have 
[03:03:00]  Like these  Giant  Backpacks  And tripods  Hanging  Off  For backpacks  And all  That thing  So we're  Just hanging  There being  Happy with  Ourselves  Looking  Completely  Ridiculous  Like why  Are we  Dressed like  We're gonna  Go fishing  In the  Middle of  Red Square  And we  Just get  Rolled up  On by  These three  Like government  Police machine  Guns  And everything  It was  Just like  The scariest  Moment of  My life  I imagine  Those guys  Are everywhere  Right  You can't  Do anything  Yeah  So it  Ended up  Being cool  You know  The Russian  Guys talked  To him  For a while 
[03:03:30]  And eventually  They took  Off  We pretended  We didn't  You know  Well we obviously  Didn't speak Russian  But we also  Pretended we  Didn't speak  English  And we're  Just like  Oh no  You know  Playing dumb  Sometimes works  But it was  Like those  Five minutes  Between when  They rolled up  On us  And when  They left  Were just  Like I  Was like  Jesus Christ  I'm gonna  End my life  In a Russian  Prison  Like what  Is the point  Of that  That could  Be an  Interesting  Exploration  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Right  A gulag  Gulag  Locked up abroad  Yeah  Then you do  Locked up abroad 
[03:04:00]  So  That's crazy  There's so much  In the book  But where were  Some of the  Coolest places  Some of the  Highlights  That you really  Were like  Holy cow  Man  So  I'm gonna  Spoil the end  Of the book  Which I maybe  Shouldn't do  But the  Second to last  Chapter of the book  We're in Egypt  And I really  Wanted to climb  The pyramids  And just  Read the book  But the  Circumstances  Didn't allow  For it  And it  Completely  Graded on me  For like  Two and a half  Years 
[03:04:30]  And finally  A couple of  Months ago  I went back  And did it  So I was  And you know  Who's doing it  Now  All the crazy  Russian  Skywalker  Climbing guys  Are all  Really into it  So  Obviously  You were trying  To go legit  And climb  The pyramids  What  No back then  When they said  No  Oh you just  Couldn't figure out  A workaround  I just bottled it  I just got  I just got too scared  And just couldn't  Figure it out  And bottled it  Yeah  So you climbed  To the top  Of one of the pyramids  Yeah  Really fun  With a couple  Of friends  Isn't that kind  Of hard  Because those 
[03:05:00]  Blocks  Are pretty  Fucking  The climb's  Pretty easy  It is  Yeah  The climb  Is  Oh that's it  Right there  Oh yeah  Oh hey  Look at that  Wow  Oh my god  Is that cool  Where's this picture  That's on  Twitter  I think I tweeted it  Yeah that's my  That's my friend  The guy who took it  Are you at the top  Top right there  Yeah yeah  The guy who took it  Is the guy at the right  That's my friend  My friend QX  Who's in the book  How the fuck  Did you do that  You just do it  Like all these  Like a lot of times  People are like  How did you do that 
[03:05:30]  What's  Is there a secret tunnel  Is there like a code  Or a password  Or something like that  And the answer is like  Honestly  Just the way you think  You do it  You know  You just  Wow  Sneak in in the middle  Of the night  And just do it  Right  There's no guards  I mean  If there are  They're pretty lazy  About it  So I actually  How long did that  Climb take  Maybe like 20 minutes  I want to say  Oh okay  And it was pretty easy  Obviously  I mean it was  It was exhausting  It was definitely  Like an exhausting climb  But it wasn't  Technically difficult  No  Wow 
[03:06:00]  Wow  And that's what  The top looks like  The top is  Covered in scratches  Like every square  Inch of the top  Is like  You know  Joe was here  1952  Oh no kidding  Like the entire thing  Yeah because the things  Are 3,000 years old  You know  There's been a lot of time  A lot of time  And you could  And you could  Climb up them  Until the 80s  Until the 80s  It was just  Kind of chill  Or maybe you know  Tip the guard  Something and do it  They only started  Getting uptight  About it in the mid 80s  So a lot of this stuff  Is stuff that 
[03:06:30]  50 years ago  Or 100 years ago  Or you know  Even 20  30 years ago  Is not a big deal  And it's only a big deal  Now  Like you could  Climb the pyramids  In the 80s  You could go to  The observation deck  Of the Chrysler building  In the 1940s  Like I sneak into  Stonehenge here  Just after hours  Just kind of walked up  And hung out of  Stonehenge for a little bit  But what do you see  After hours  That you don't see  During the day  During the  Like it's just  You go during the day  You roll up  They send you through  The tchotchke shop  You pay 15 quid  You have these ropes 
[03:07:00]  Everybody stand behind  The ropes taking pictures  If you just go at night  You just do whatever you want  Like you can go  You go there  You walk up the hill  You hang out  You kiss the rock  I don't know  It's just a different experience  You know  It's a different experience  Right  But you know  You could do that  Just hang out  At Stonehenge  70 years ago  So a lot of this stuff  Is not new  I mean I want to stress that  Like none of this is  New or discovery  Or whatever  Right  A lot of it is  Just as  More and more people travel  As you know 
[03:07:30]  Things go on  Things become more and more  And more restricted  And this is kind of  A response to that restriction  If stuff was more chill  It wouldn't be a big deal  You think this book  Is going to fuck it up  For others  I don't think so  I mean it's  A I don't talk about  A whole bunch of really  Like tight stuff in the book  A lot of it is  Takes place between  2005 2007  And the stories  That were crazy to me  Back in 2006  Are not crazy stories 
[03:08:00]  So much anymore  I mean they will be  For the reader  But like not for me  So something like  Going into the catacombs  Was the  Like I was like  Wow this is the craziest  Thing I've done in my life  I'm flying across the world  I'm going in a hole  In the ground  And the catacombs are like  Urban exploration 101  You know  Really  Yeah absolutely  But you could go there  On a legit tour right  Yeah you can do  What do you get to do differently  So on a short tour  Of the catacombs  They take you down  It's a self-guided walking tour 
[03:08:30]  You go down into the tunnels  You walk for about  I think about a half a mile  Or so  Through the tunnels  And it's where all the bones are  And the bones are like  Neatly stacked  And everything like that  If you just go in  A different way  Through a hatch  Or a hole in the ground  You've got about  170 miles to navigate  You know  It's not like  One little tunnel  With a night means path  It's like playing  Dungeons and Dragons  Holy fuck  You know  It's like  You look at the map  And you're like  Literally like  Wow when I was 13  I was a 
[03:09:00]  You know  Half elf mage  Going through here  It's really crazy  You could spend a week  Down there easy  I didn't realize  It was so big  Yeah no  It's gigantic  It runs almost  From the Seine  To the southern border  Of Paris  Like it runs  Almost entirely  Under the 14th  Or on DC map  Like you can walk  I mean  Well we  Actually my friend  Steve organized a trip  Where we tried to walk  Underground  Underneath Paris  Like underneath  The entire city  Of Paris 
[03:09:30]  So you can get  From the southern border  To almost the Seine  Like you can walk  The entire south bank  In the catacombs  And then we did  Sewers for the north  But how do you guys  Figure out where to pop out  That's just knowledge  That's been passed around  That's like  You got to know  Some folks sometimes  To figure that  Because this is like  An underground culture  Where you guys  Share information  You got a little  Something about New York  I'm going to trade  For a little something  About Sweden  Or whatever  I would call it  A network  Like the guy  I would climb  The pyramids with 
[03:10:00]  He lives in Paris  And you know  Whenever I go  Over there  We always hang out  And see stuff  And you know  We hang out  And see stuff  When he comes over here  A lot of it  Are traveling Australians  Australians have these  Like magic abilities  To live anywhere  And go anywhere  I don't know  But yeah  It's like a worldwide  Network  And you know  You know some people  And some people  Know some other people  And there you go  You ever get arrested  I got arrested  In France once  Actually it's the first  Story in the book  We climbed up the  We were just 
[03:10:30]  We were just  Boozed man  We were just  It's like half  Of these adventures  Are just like  You're boozed  And you're like  Well it seems like  A good idea at the time  So we're in France  We're super boozed  This guy  This French guy  We were with  Is like  Hey do you want  To go climb a church  And we're like  Sure we're up  For climbing a church  And like  We cross the river  And I'm like  I think the church  He's talking about  Is the fucking  Notre Dame  Yeah  Oh fuck  So we're just there 
[03:11:00]  And we just  Monkey it  Like they've got  These little  Scaffolding things  And we fit a couple  Of them together  And we're rattling  Like crazy  And you know  We get up a couple  Of the terraces  And like  We just kind of like  Finagle our way up  And you know  It's one of those  Things where like  Looking back on it  I don't know  How it took so long  For us to get arrested  But at the time  I was like  It's France  It'll be fine  Nobody will notice  But it was  A very chill experience  France is a little 
[03:11:30]  More civilized  Than some other places  Or a little more Latin  So we're just up there  The cops come up  They're like  Excuse us  You cannot be here  Take us to the station  Which is right across  The street  Stick us in a  Stick us in a cell  Take our  Do a little breathalyzer  Test thing  And then after  A couple of hours  They took us into  The room  The police chief  Is there  Police chief  Is dressed like you  Like you know  Just like  Casual  Casual 
[03:12:00]  He's like  Okay  So did you get  Good pictures  And I was like  I was freaked  Because like  You know  I watch cop shows  I'm not answering  Questions or anything  And I'm just like  He's like  You know  Kind of rolls his eyes  At me  He has a piece of paper  He's like  Okay  So listen  You're a tourist  You're taking pictures  You don't know  You can't climb cathedral  You're very sorry  You don't do it again  Here sign this  You go away  And I was like  Wow  In America  I'm not signing  Anything a cop 
[03:12:30]  Puts in front of me  And it's like  Sign this  You know  But France  It was just  It's just France  It's just a little more chill  So I was like  Alright  And he's like  He takes his pen  He gets up  Takes his pen  Walks out of the door  And just goes  Voila  Like that  And yeah  Just throws it over his shoulder  And I was like  Wow  They are  Would not do that  If they caught me  Climbing St. Patrick's Cathedral  Probably didn't talk to the police  Just some assholes  I wanted to fuck with you  Yeah so that happened in France 
[03:13:00]  And yeah that was  I got called once here in New York  But I got out in a couple of hours  That was an interesting experience  That's about it  Nothing serious  What was the one in New York?  I just got caught like  Not even anything real  Just like kind of on the wrong side of the fence  That really should be like a  Not a big deal  But for whatever reason  They were uptight about it  So they took us in  They got us out in like 
[03:13:30]  Two or three hours  But it was just an interesting experience  Like I had never been in a  New York City jail or anything  So I was like  Alright well  We'll find out what this is like  So you know  I just got thrown in  With essentially like  The local knuckleheads  For a few hours  And it was  You know  Just seeing that side of life  And you know  The thing I took out of it  Is just like  Nobody was in there  For anything real  You know  People were in there  For like  I got an open container  Or like  I was smoking weed  Or like  You know  Just  Piddly garbage things 
[03:14:00]  That it's like  You know  And they all  Like one of the guys  Got  Collared for an open container  And he had  Outstanding summons  For riding his bike  On the sidewalk  And you know  They sent him through the system  Like  24 hours in jail  Without like  You know  Just disappeared  And it's just like  So a lot of folks in there  Were just in there  On like  Garbage stuff  And it's like  Ruins your whole next day  Getting a rest record  Like  It's just one of those things 
[03:14:30]  Where it's like  It's a little out of control  Right  Like in my opinion  Now you said that  The best place you like to be  Is on top of a bridge  In New York City  Yeah  Or any city actually  How many bridges  Have you been on top of?  Oh a lot  Brooklyn Bridge  Yep  Manhattan Bridge  Yep  Williamsburg  Queensborough  Have you climbed outside?  Yeah  First to  First to  First  We all see those  That shit  When we're going across bridges  And you always kind of imagine  Like  It would be kind of cool  To walk up this  Exactly man  But  That's where  Disappeared  And it's just like 
[03:15:00]  So a lot of folks in there  Were just in there  On like  Garbage stuff  And it's like  Ruins your whole next day  Getting a rest record  Like  It's just one of those things  Where it's like  It's a little out of control  Right  Like in my opinion  Now you said that  The best place you'd like to be  Is on top of a bridge  In New York City  Yeah  Or any city actually  How many bridges  Have you been on top of?  A lot  Brooklyn Bridge  Yep  Manhattan Bridge  Yep  Williamsburg  Queensborough  Have you climbed outside?  Yeah  First to  First  We all see that shit 
[03:15:30]  When we're going across bridges  And you always kind of imagine  Like  It would be kind of cool  To walk up this  But that's where it ends  For most people  Right  But like in Sydney  Australia  They have a bridge climb  And it's enormously popular  It does like  $60 million of business  A year or something  Like everybody goes  It's like so cool  And the Sydney Harbor Bridge  Is probably the most  Famous landmark  On the continent  You know  So  It's something where people  Are like  Why do you want to do that?  And I'm like  Don't you want to do that? 
[03:16:00]  And they're like  Well yeah of course  And I'm like  Well then you answered  Your own question  So I think  I mean  I would love it  If they could do  You know  The equivalent  Of a Sydney Harbor Bridge  Climb on the  Queensborough  I've said that too  Yeah  I think it would be  I think it would make  A ton of money  And be great for the city  No shit  Like climbing  On the outside of the bridge  However they would do it  Well that's how  They do it in Sydney though  Yeah  They do it in Sydney  It's amazing  Someone tells me  There's not many lawyers  Yeah I know  But this is the kind of thing  Where if you have like  The will to figure it out  Like you can get around 
[03:16:30]  The lawyer stuff  Like I'm a firm believer  That the people  Make the decisions  And then tell the lawyers  To make it work  What I don't understand  About climbing bridges  Outside like that  Is I mean  When all the cars  Going by  How the fuck  Do you get away with that  I haven't climbed a bridge  In a while actually  In like  Definitely  You know in a while  Because they're absolutely  Watching bridges  Around New York City  These days  I mean  Folks know  To go over that first fence  The one fence  That you know  People go  All right  I gotta climb over that  And then maybe  Fall into the fucking river 
[03:17:00]  And then I get on that thing  And then I go up  Well you know  If you don't  Yeah  It takes a little bit  Of monkeying around  Fuck  It takes a little bit  Of monkeying around  But you know  Sometimes it's  I mean it's worth it  Because being on top  Of a bridge  Is the most amazing experience  Because like  You get two different views  You get two different experiences  Like you've been to  Long Island City  Or Williamsburg  And you're looking  Across the river  At the skyline  And that's awesome  And you've been up  To like the Empire State Building  Or whatever  And you're looking down  On the city  And that's also awesome 
[03:17:30]  If you're on top  Of a bridge  You get those two things  At once  You get like  The vertical separation  And the horizontal separation  It's this totally unique view  And plus like  You know  You're by yourself  You're on top of a bridge  It's like  A really great experience  Jeez  I'll  Why are you guys  Shaking your heads at me  I'll drive on the bridge  I absolutely think it's cool  It's just like  Crazy  There's one other  Do you ever have a near miss  Where you had a little slip  Besides falling in the hole 
[03:18:00]  At the courthouse  No I've been pretty good  So  Like getting arrested  Getting hurt  All of that stuff  All comes from just like  Getting too happy with yourself  And not paying attention  It doesn't come from like  I've never had a near  Or forgetting your flashlight  Or forgetting your flashlight  But I've never had a near miss  Not checking the batteries  We were alright though  We ended up okay  It was only  You know  It only fell in a hole once  But it all comes from  Not paying attention  So the times 
[03:18:30]  When I've ever been in  Like had any kind of  Slips or near misses  Have always been with  Stuff I was comfortable with  And just got too comfortable with it  And did stop paying attention  All the crazy stuff  Where I'm like  Really hyper alert  And really like  In the zone  And focused  I've always been okay with  Right okay  And finally  Ant brought this  To my attention  The other day  That someone climbed up  The World's Fair  What is that called?  Yeah the Observation Towers  Oh yeah  The Observation Towers  At the World's Fair  There was a video recently  Was it a video in  Or pictures? 
[03:19:00]  Pictures and his story  He used a grappling hook  To get up there  Because he couldn't  Is that Steve's old story?  I think it was  You found it on the website?  Might have  Yeah it might have been  Because I remember  He had  I mean that's got to be  From like ten years ago  Yeah yeah  I think it was  I really like that story  It was a good one  He's like  He's at night  He's trying to throw  The grappling hook  And it's going  Clang clang on the ground  Yeah yeah  That's Steve's story  Yeah that's a good one  But that's from like  I think ten years ago  Or like a while ago  And you've been up there too  You said right?  Yeah I was up there once  You know not too long 
[03:19:30]  After that  Probably like  Six or seven years ago  Oh no I take it back  I was up there twice  We were pilled off of there  Once just for fun  Wow really?  Yeah  Just off of the lower deck  Not off of the super high deck  And you were telling me  The stairs are all gone right?  The stairs are like  Super rusty  And like  Oh you got the picture  Yeah you can kind of see  You got no real treads  On the stairs  They're just  You got to kind of  Walk up on the rails  That the treads  Used to be on  And that's all rusted  That's actually one  Of the better ones  Oh my god really?  Yeah 
[03:20:00]  Jeez Louise  How do you get back down?  It's the same way you get up  Although they did  I know but it just seems  Easier to climb up  Than when you're seeing  Like a lot of stairs missing  And it's time to climb down  And that seems almost scarier  Climbing down is always easier for me  It is  Because I'm already in the zone  And like it's less  I don't have to like  Get hyped up for it  They did renovate the tower  A couple of years ago  So they might have  Yeah they painted it  Or some shit  Yeah I don't know  Yeah  I can't remember that  But I mean that's another place 
[03:20:30]  Like throw in a new staircase  And let people up there again  I mean  Seriously  It's a great view  People would pay  Yeah definitely  People would pay to see this shit  Cool  I just find it so fun  Like you can't do anything  In the city  So I can't imagine  Them allowing you to do  Anything that would be fun  But there's been  There's been a lot of stuff  That's gotten reopened  Because you have folks  Who go there  Kind of gorilla style  Take pictures  People get into it  The High Line  Like the High Line  Was this beautiful  Old abandoned rail line 
[03:21:00]  Got a lot of attention  From people just walking on  And taking pictures  And now it's redeveloped  Another one is  The old City Hall station  Like this beautiful  Beautiful old abandoned  Subway station  Underneath City Hall  That's one that  Now they open for tours  You've got to join  The Transit Museum  But you can go on a tour  Oh you can finally go  Check it out  Yeah  So I think that like  Once interest in this stuff  Becomes known  People you know  And it's known that  Hey you know 
[03:21:30]  You can do tours  You can make a buck  Right  Stuff happens  And stuff gets opened  Like I love  Abandoned observation decks  And they reopened  The Rockefeller Center  Observation deck  Was abandoned for 20 years  Before they reopened it  And you fool around  With the subways  Where you got to like  Time out the trains  Going by and shit  Yeah I haven't been  In the subways  For a minute either  I mean that one is like  You know if you have  The urge to go  You're not going to  Get talked out of it  If you don't have  The urge to go  You're not going to  Get talked into it  I feel like  It's just one of those 
[03:22:00]  Things some people  Really are into  But I haven't been  In a minute so  And that's to go  See the abandoned  Subway stations  Yeah there's a bunch  Of you know  There's a bunch of  Stuff in the subways  Any of the big rats  Down there  No see the thing is  Everybody always asks me  About rats and tunnels  Rats live where there's food  And there's food  Where there's people  So most of the rats  In the subway stations  Are actually in the stations  Because that's where  People are and throw  Their garbage  And stuff like that  They're not in the tunnels  Because there's no food  In the tunnels  I have run into rats  In the London sewers 
[03:22:30]  Though and it was  Really gross  How big?  Oh like  Someone apparently  Cracked a rat  Big and like  A nice colony  Remember that  Someone cracked a rat  You let a nervous  Fart out Moses?  Who me?  Yeah  I don't get nervous  Who farted  I don't know  But wow  Sam?  No  Sam is that you?  I'm a lady  That's terrible  Very cool  Well Moses  I think the book's  Going to do very well  I want to have you back  Because there's so much  More we want to cover 
[03:23:00]  Like people want to  You know talk about  Their cities  And stuff like that  Yeah because every city  Has cool stuff to see  Definitely  I go to Rochester a lot  And I know  Not a lot  Once or twice a year  But they have a  They have an abandoned  Subway system up there  Yeah I've never been  I would love to go  I was reading some  Articles on it  It's pretty damn cool  What they were talking about  I would love to see it  There's an abandoned  Subway system  And it's actually  Not abandoned  It was built  And never used  In Cincinnati also  So there's  Why did they never use it?  I don't know  The entire story behind it 
[03:23:30]  I know that  You know  They had constructed it  And then I think  They ran out of funding  Or something like that  I don't know  The entire story behind it  I just know  There's this entire system  In Antwerp  There's a system  That was built  And not used  Wow  So you know  Wherever you are  Any city in the world  There's like stuff to see  Have you gone deep  Underground in New York  Where the  What are they called?  The mud  Where the drilling  Yeah what do they call them?  Oh the  Are you talking like  The second avenue 
[03:24:00]  Subway  No even deeper than that  For the water  City water tunnel number three  No I've never been  So  Yeah they call the workers  Like mud rants  Or mud fucking  Sand hogs  Sand hogs  Of course  Sand hogs  So sand hogs  Are heroes of all of ours  We think sand hogs  Are like the coolest people  In the world  So they're digging  A bunch of tunnel projects  They're digging  A new tunnel to Grand Central  They're digging  The second avenue subway  They were doing  The west side line  Extending the number seven line  They're doing city tunnel number three  So there's a lot of tunnels  And the MTA especially 
[03:24:30]  Has been good about  Like letting engineering students  On tours and things  Like you know  For educational purposes  And stuff  So I've gotten to go  To a couple of them  Just on official tours  Is it cool?  It's super cool man  And it's the kind of thing  Where like I was on the one  Where they're digging  The tunnel to Grand Central  And I was like  Why don't you do these tours  All the time  And the guy was just like  We got a tunnel to dig man  Yeah no kidding  We can't like  Right no kidding  Alright fair enough  You know  But you know  That's another thing 
[03:25:00]  Like so many people  Are interested in it  And I think they could  You know  Definitely take  You know  You can't do it 24-7  But they could  Certainly take more folks  Down there  The city water tunnel  Number three  I've never been to  I'd really like to go  On an excursion in there  Very good  Alright  We're going to have  Moses back  But his book is called  Hidden Cities  Moses NYC on Twitter  But Hidden Cities  When does the book  Come out?  Tomorrow?  No man  The book dropped  Last Thursday  Oh it was?  Check it out  Yeah so check it out  In all the usual places

[03:26:00]  And I think it's pretty obvious  Very cool  Alright Moses  Moses Gates  Like I said  MosesNYC on Twitter  Hidden Cities  Travels to the secret corners  Of the world's great metropolises  A memoir of urban exploration  Alright man  Thanks Moses  Alright thanks for having me on  And I think that's it for today right?  Yeah  Alright let's get the fuck out of here  Fuck  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  Pretty much over  Pretty much over  This show will be available later today  With SiriusXM on demand

[03:27:00]  Terrible by the way  I watched a little bit of it  What movie?  The Kubrick documentary  Room 237 or whatever  Horrible  We talked about it on our show  How bad it is  I was having a meeting with my executive producer  Of the Elevator Show  I know who Troy is  You don't  I understand  You can't just say Troy anymore  Troy Kwan  Executive producer  Of Opie's Elevator Show  The Elevator Show  Show some respect  Well it's not a real show  You watch  Yeah  It is dude  It's an internet sensation  Are you getting the E.T. salary?

Why don't you have much of a budget for the show?  Because we're just starting out man  Let's show up in them pockets of yours  Seinfeld started out as a dumb pilot  Yeah  But his executive producer was getting paid  Not really  Yeah Richard Branson's backing him  Did he?  No  So we have to film something now  For the drumming episode  And then we've got to figure out something for this week to film 
[03:28:00]  When Moses said  One of my favorite spots to be is on top of a bridge  Yeah  I was like  That would probably be my least favorite spot to be  I can't imagine  I'd go there in a second  You would go up on top of a bridge  I'd be scared  And I'd have to kind of like assess the situation  But yeah in a second  You know what else I was thinking of?  When Moses was telling all the stories about like  Almost getting busted in Russia  And the Parisian police taking him and everything  I was thinking  After everything that he's been through  Imagine if he had known that Sal was scared when building security 
[03:28:30]  Stopped him for the drums on the elevator  It's funny  Alright we got stuff to do  This is not important to me  What the radio show?  Yeah we got to do the  Your channel and  All of you?

Going over the show  Oh just filling him in?  Yep  Roland just said he would suck some dick  For carrot cake  I'm sure he would  He probably would  Joe in Tennessee  What did you learn on today's  Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that the name  Greg Opie Hughes  Doesn't mean shit  In Philadelphia  Why do you say that?  Because he couldn't get in?  Yep  If he didn't mention the name  Primetime Sam Roberts 
[03:30:00]  He may have got a table  That's right  I go to any sushi place  I want to in Philadelphia  That's right  Alright  Have a good day  Alright you too  Yeah  Yeah the big war  Between Marimoto  And Budokan  Who knew  I hope he was so  Wrapped up in this sushi stuff  That he would  He would go to war  Over mistreatment  At a restaurant  My god  I mean  Eric I knew  I know you  Hold dear  The way you're treated  In restaurants  Because you're  You know  You're the guy there 
[03:30:30]  Five star  Right  You're walking in like  Look at me  You know how much  I'm going to be spending  And they're like  And if they're not  Treating you well  Yeah  Fuck out of here  Exactly  You know  Not a big sushi guy though  You're not?  I know it's big business  And a lot of people love it  But just  I've tried  I really have tried  And I just can't get into it  Why not?  I don't know  Certain seafood  Just  Especially raw seafood  Just doesn't do it for me  Just disagrees with you 
[03:31:00]  No  I don't enjoy the taste of it  Oh  It's not back to the  Shitting problem  No  No  No  No  Oh  Oh  Oh  So you're not the type  That's going to go on a raw diet  Anytime soon  Marshall  You're funny  I felt like E-Rock  Yesterday  Because I was just  All sandwiches all the time  I had a delicious BLT  For lunch  And then a nice chicken cutlet  With mozzarella for dinner  Wow  Yeah  I mean it was  It was just sandwiches yesterday  That's great  Did you have a sandwich weekend?

Friday night  Did you make out with your wife after?  Um  She  I don't know  She was pretty  She had her friends over  She was pretty  Gone at that point  She didn't want anything to do with you?  No  They were just drinking and talking  And whatever  So you were like  Fuck this  I'm going to enjoy a loaf of garlic bread

It's not a roll is it?  Yeah  It's like a foot long  Exactly  Yeah  It's a loaf of garlic bread  It's delicious  I would imagine  Bobby the champ  Hey what's up guys  What's up buddy?  Opie's kind of 
[03:32:30]  Shooting himself in the foot  Sort of  Because Budokan and Morimoto  Are the same restaurant group  Star restaurants  So they're owned  They're owned by the same people  So he was over here  Shit talking Morimoto  And singing the praises of Budokan  Yeah but it's just the same people  He might as well have been  Shitting on Taco Bell  And talking about how great KFC was  Yep basically  That's hilarious dude  How do you know so much about restaurants?  I don't know if I know as much about  As Roland but I do my thing  Especially in New York  You're a little bit of a foodie yourself? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah I got one for Roland  Shea Sardine  A new place in the village  Where they sell sardines?  Say again?  Sardines?  Shea Sardine  And it's like sushi-ish  It's very cool  What do you think of the tuna sushi pizza idea?  Did you hear that?  I hope he wants to do  First of all we went from like  Beer and  I mean tequila and donuts  To now we want to try like  Raw tuna sushi pizza? 
[03:33:30]  I mean I would eat it  You're getting a little hoity-toity now  Yeah and especially in the morning  I don't know if that's  It's not a great idea  Morning dish  No  Alright Bobby  Alright guys  Thanks a lot  Be good  Would you try any of that  Tuna sushi pizza Eric?  I would try it  I don't think I would like it  And I don't even eat pepperoni on my pizza  I would try it  So I'll be  I will stay away from that  Do you think that would result in the pizza problem  Or you'd be okay?  Pizza problem's gone  Because of your medication?  Yeah  You're taking pills  So all the shit comes out a little better?  Oh yeah 
[03:34:00]  Well  I guess  If you want to put it that way  But it's the way my stomach processes it  If you want to be  If you want to be so blunt and uncouth  Okay  Yeah  Yes  You know you gotta treat yourself well  That includes your insides and your outside Eric  Always  You  What?  Always be treating  Oh  No I didn't say you treat yourself  ADT  New t-shirt  Always be treating  I said treat yourself well  Not treat yourself  Oh  And that includes hygiene 
[03:34:30]  That includes not only brushing your teeth  Like you have a little  I don't even want to say a 5 o'clock shadow anymore  You got a nice stubble going  Well  I ran out of razors yesterday  You did?  Yes  And you're not going to reach in the garbage  And zombie out your face with some old razor right?  No  And I had a family event to go to  And I looked quite the fool  Did anybody make fun of you?  No nobody made fun of me  But still  You know they were talking about you behind your back  Like Jesus Christ  Eric has really let himself go  No there was a couple others who had the same issue 
[03:35:00]  Except I was the one who had the in-laws saying  What the hell  You look like shit  Well see  You run a very delicate line  Because of  Well certain other things  Like you run that delicate line of  You're very close to looking like shit at any given moment  Yes  So if you don't shave or you don't comb your hair right  You're in shitsville  Yes but I clean up very well  Do you?  Yeah  Alright  You know you have to clean up  I mean  How much  Eric  You're a rich man 
[03:35:30]  But even you  Even you  Yeah  How much are you paying in razors a month  That you could just let it  That you could just let it  You know  Fall by the wayside like this  You know what Sam  Too much nowadays  Yeah  Because the pack of razors  I think is over 20 bucks  And it's how much?

[03:39:30]  He's not used to it  What do you got for me?  I'm looking for the highlighter one  Let's go to  Clinton, Alabama  Hey guys  I'm sorry to bother you  But on the subject of voices  Hey E-Rock  I heard a Southern New Hampshire  University commercial last night  And I swear  It sounded like it was you  I tried to look it up  But I couldn't find it  But it's a brand new commercial  For their online university  And it did sound like it was you  Was that you?  If E-Rock's getting voiceover work  And not sharing it with me  I'll be very pissed off  Are you the voice of  Southern New Hampshire University? 
[03:40:00]  And a new soft drink coming out  Both of those?  Yeah  Why wouldn't you  Why wouldn't you share  Some of the work with me?  Why would I?

[03:41:30]  But  You're a hell of a talent  Thanks  Eric is just a  Slobby  Garlicy  What?  Chunky  He just doesn't care at all  Does he?  No I mean no  He doesn't have a lot of passion  But I wasn't going to call him  Slobby and garlicky  I can just imagine  With his like  Sloppy haircut  And his crappy  Cheesy clothes  And his bad breath  I mean  Why would a woman  Deal with that?  I mean I don't know  Eric are you hearing this?  I'm hearing it  It's completely wrong  Oh Sammy 
[03:42:00]  Sudoku me man  Alright  You win a Sudoku  For your prize comments  I think I have one in the office  I'm going to put you on hold  Okay thank you  Obi did not get to complete his Sudoku today  Because we had Moses in here  Moses the urban explorer  Who did the video  You remember the video  That Obi posted  It was him  Moses was the guy  Losing his mind  Who went up on the Chrysler building  I was looking up the videos  While they were talking  While they were doing the interview today  I was looking up the videos 
[03:42:30]  Of those Russian kids  That like  They climb these giant structures  And literally  They go out on these I-beams  That are sticking out  Stories  I mean 30 stories up in the air  You just see forests  Down below it  I mean it's the  It's the height of a skyscraper  And there's an I-beam sticking out  With nothing around it  And they're climbing out  Holding on to the I-beam  And then jumping and letting go  Jumping and letting go  They could be dead  I think the ones that 
[03:43:00]  Have died  You don't see those videos  Because they were probably  Confiscated  I-I-I  There have to be videos  Of Russian kids  Dying from climbing up  High things  Because the amount of  Russian kids  That climb this shit  Is  It's awe-inspiring  It's mind-blowing  Huh  You got that Denny clip?  Yeah I have  Him teaching a radio lesson  Alright  Just give me that one then  Hey this is the worst of the week  Countdown on the Opie and Anthony channel  Welcome back  My name is Dennis Falcone 
[03:43:30]  Your old school radio broadcaster  And I hope you are enjoying yourself  And I say you  Because radio is a personal medium  So we speak one-on-one  So if you're enjoying this  Call up another buddy  And let's get together  And enjoy more of the countdown  And speaking of professional broadcasters  Boy he has talked to them all  He's interviewed them all  It's James Lipton  In studio with the boys  See Eric  When you do the countdown  You never give people a lesson  No  People don't learn anything  I yell at them  Why?  Why do you have such disdain? 
[03:44:00]  I don't know  It's like yeah  You're listening to this  This is what's going on  And I just gave away  The whole plot to the bit  So there you go  Enjoy  Why do you still do that?  No  Once you pointed it out  I stopped doing it  Oh  But then there's certain times  Well I'll blatantly say it  And say yes  I'm spoiling this for you  It's your natural  It's weird  Because your natural instinct  You have to stop yourself  Is to  When you intro something  Tell the beginning middle  And end of it  Like you  Like Dennis was just on there  Going hey  James Lipton in studio  He's interviewed a ball  Here he is with the boys 
[03:44:30]  You would have to be like  James Lipton was in studio  With the guys  He's on inside the actor's studio  He came in  He told a whole bunch of stories  And then he left  No  And then you say  One was about when he was a pimp in France  And he told the whole story  He told us he'd never said it before  Here's what it sounded like  Well I just heard you explain what he says  Look I'm saving people time  That's your instinct though  And it's not radio training  I don't know where you get that from  No I don't know where that came from either  I think it's  But once it was pointed out  I really tried to curb that 
[03:45:00]  I think your natural inclination  Is that you want to be the guy delivering the news  Like you want to be where they heard this from  So if you can get the information out real quick  Before the bit begins  You can get it done  You know  Yeah maybe  That's what I think  That way you get a little  You get a little credit for it  And it's not something you're doing  Sort of consciously  But you want to be the guy  To deliver the news  You want to get the credit for that  You want to have given people the scoop  Sure 
[03:45:30]  You don't think so?  You think that's what it is?  I don't think that's what I'm  Well you said consciously  I don't think that's what I'm trying to do  Do you get pleasure out of that?  Do you get pleasure out of delivering the news?  No  Because I raced through those things  No no no  I mean in general  Not usually  Because then there's a lot of responsibility to the news  So you  It's just like  I don't want to keep dealing with this  I just told you  Move on  Take it  Tim in Alabama  Slabow  Have you 
[03:46:00]  Is that endearing to you yet Eric?  No  Tim  And that was Roland  Was it?  Yeah  Oh  Well why wouldn't he come back here and just say it?  I have no idea  He's a maniac  I was  I gotta tell you  You liked 40 year old virgin right?  Yeah  That movie?  Yeah  It was a funny movie  40 year old virgin and Knocked Up  That was funny too  If you like those movies  You're gonna love This Is 40  I don't know if you've heard about it  But it's the latest hit comedy from Judd Apatow  This Is 40 looks in on the lives of Pete and Debbie 
[03:46:30]  Played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann  A few years after the events of Knocked Up  After years of marriage  The couple's struggling to balance romance careers  Their own aging parents  And of course  Their now teenage 8 year old daughters  All while trying to figure out how to enjoy the rest of their lives  This Is 40 features an all star cast  Including  Wait till you hear this  John Lithgow  Megan Fox  Jason Segel  Melissa McCarthy  Lena Dunham 
[03:47:00]  Graham Parker  And Albert Brooks  All in one movie  This Is 40 is an honest, candid, and heartwarming comedy  About the challenges and rewards of marriage and parenthood in the modern age  This Is 40 takes us through Pete and Debbie's milestone meltdown  As they each turn 40  While trying to navigate sex, romance, career triumphs, financial hardships, and everyday life  This Is 40 is a very funny movie  Own it now with digital download  Or watch it anytime with movies on demand 
[03:47:30]  28 days  Before Netflix or Redbox  Yeah  Netflix, Redbox, behind on shit  Not on demand  So that's going on right now  This Is 40  I was watching  Oh  Roland is texting  That was Sal that called in and said Slavo  Wow  Too much attention on Sal today I guess  You know what's funny  They don't understand  Like  There was no reason to even prank call that in  Because the phone screen said 
[03:48:00]  I want to talk to Sam about Wrestlemania  And I was sitting there going  Eh, I don't know if I want to talk about wrestling right now  But nah, nothing's going on  I guess I'll take it  If the phone screen had said  I would like to yell Slavo loudly into the phone  I'd immediately take the call  See, that's not helping  Because now you're going to get a bunch of those  To just call in  Yeah, I'd like to say Slavo very loudly  I was watching  You know what movie I watched?  Link is a Rob  Did you hear what I was talking about on Sunday?  You said you wish you could sing your tweets 
[03:48:30]  That's right, yeah  I came away from that movie A Changed Man  Like, have you seen it?  No  Well, don't ugh me then  Okay  Then you're just being judgmental  Because I put it in  I was talking about this yesterday  On the show I do on Sunday afternoons  I put it in thinking  Okay  I'm going to watch a movie that Jess enjoys  And I'm going to be a hero  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm  And I enjoyed it way more than she did  Like, from  Really?  From the opening credits 
[03:49:00]  Until the movie ended  I was enthralled  I was glued to my screen  What makes it so interesting?  Because it's a great story  Like, I was sitting there  And I was like  I was watching it  And I watched all the bonus features at the end  And I go  Jess, this movie was amazing  This movie wasn't even about the French Revolution  I was ready to just sit there  And watch these guys sing  And be like  Why are they wearing those goofy Napoleon hats?  But Jess  This was not a story about the French Revolution 
[03:49:30]  This was a story about life  This was a story about the dreams  That we begin life with  And what becomes of them  And what becomes of us  As we travel through this journey  And I look over at the couch  And Jess is asleep  She wasn't interested in any of this anymore  She could care less  She could care less  She was like  Yeah, I enjoyed the movie  But that thing has been notorious  As being like a chick play  Or a chick film, right?  Dude  I gotta tell you something  The story's incredible  I don't care 
[03:50:00]  And it's three hours, right?  It's two and a half hours  I wish it was three hours  I could have easily watched another half hour  Really?  I loved all the songs  But, I mean, we've gone over this before  I have a soft spot for a lot of musicals  Especially Andrew Lloyd Webber  What do you want to say?  No, we've never gone over that  Remember I was playing the Cats song  Over and over again one day?  I thought you were just being a dick  I love that Cats song  Oh, I didn't know you  It's on my phone  Okay  Yeah, no  I like musicals  Let's go to some of the phones  And see what they're saying  Mike in Philly 
[03:50:30]  DJ Mike in Philly  Coming to you  Slow down  Lady Trucker  Eric Slavo  Roland Slavo  And you're gonna crash  Mike the Trucker  Roland Slavo  Tommy  Slavo  Yeah, see, I mean  I guess they were more focused  On the other thing  No, that was South who called  Yeah, I was like  I was sending an email  Then I heard 
[03:51:00]  Roland  I go, no, I didn't call this time  Dude, I was wrong  You were talking about Les Mis  Like, about how great it was  And I was like  Get the fuck out of here  Roland  Everybody told me that  It was incredible  It was incredible  And I was bummed out  When I left  When I stopped watching the movie  First of all  I'm still thinking about it now  But when I stopped  Let's see who's on the hotline  It's Sal  Oh, Sal, is this you?  Who do you?  You just wanted to say Slavo  When I stopped watching that movie  I was bummed out  And it wasn't because of what happened to Anne Hathaway 
[03:51:30]  And it wasn't anything to do with Jean Valjean  I was bummed out that that wasn't like  The biggest movie ever  Like, I was sitting there  And I started box office mojoing it  Les Mis only made $150 million  It is a lot for a musical  Wait, what?  It is a lot of money for a musical  Dude, but that was like an epic movie  Oh yeah, it was  Like, it should have made more money  Because, I mean, The Hangover made $250 million  Yeah 
[03:52:00]  Identity Thief has already made $130 million  And that's, you know, that's nothing  Yeah  That's just a dopey comedy  I was watching that movie  That movie was better than Titanic  Yeah  And Titanic's like the biggest movie of all time  Yeah, Hugh Jackman kicked ass in this  So that's why I picked Hugh Jackman  Because he was so amazing  He was really good  I mean, and that's the other thing  I was sitting there looking at Jess  And I was like, God damn it  If only  If Daniel Day-Lewis had sat a year out  He was like, I'm not going to do anything this year  It would have made Wolverine's career 
[03:52:30]  Or if it was a little bit  If they released Abraham or the Lincoln a little bit earlier  People would have got sick of it  Because of so much push  Maybe  And then it would have been edged out  But yeah, I mean, that would have been it for Hugh Jackman  It would have made him  It would have taken him to the next, next level  Yeah  I was like, Jess, I couldn't believe this movie  And Jess was like, Sam, I think you might be gay  No, I'm not  That's ridiculous  She was like, we watched it last night  And she could hear me in the shower
