<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic, alcohol-fueled Friday morning affair featuring hosts Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton. The show began with jovial anticipation for the weekend, quickly devolving into repeated plays of Rebecca Black's "Friday," much to the chagrin of some listeners.  A significant portion focused on the disastrous Broadway production of *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark*, detailing its mishaps and cast changes.  The humor was consistently crude, relying heavily on sexual innuendo, offensive jokes, and racial slurs.  Tangents abounded, including a listener's hatred of the show, an extensive analysis of Van Halen albums, nostalgic reminiscences about youthful "road sodas," and merciless mockery of a listener's poetic attempt to commemorate Elizabeth Taylor's death.  The show interspersed various musical selections, driven by the hosts' whims and a "Deep Tracks" segment from another station.  A recurring element involved vulgar banter between the hosts.

A caller, Bill, initiated a debate about Van Halen's post-debut album decline, sparking a lively discussion and disagreement over the band's merits.  This evolved into a "rock war" with caller Ken, comparing Van Halen to Black Sabbath, encompassing lyrical interpretations (like Van Halen's "Ice Cream Man") and contrasting their perceived "fun" factor.  This led to playing numerous listener-submitted "fun songs," including ABBA's "Dancing Queen," provoking strong reactions.  A rambling anecdote about one host's childhood and a discussion of viral videos, including a subway altercation between two overweight women, one eating spaghetti, followed.  The hosts' commentary on the video was laced with derogatory language, and the discussion broadened to encompass racial issues and public behavior.

The show proceeded with analysis of various Drudge Report videos showcasing public outbursts and violent confrontations in locations like Chuck E. Cheese, H&M, and Burger King.  One video, depicting an aggressive Black woman in a bikini at a Burger King, was described in graphic detail with highly offensive language. Another featured a police interaction in Savannah, Georgia, where a white couple's altercation with Black people in a truck resulted in the white man punching the truck and the subsequent arrest of the white couple, with excessive force used against the woman.  The hosts expressed their opinions on the incident, employing racial slurs and offensive language. Callers participated in the ensuing debate about racial dynamics, police brutality, and perceived biases, also using offensive language.  A news segment about radiation concerns after the Fukushima disaster, showcasing a heated exchange between Nancy Grace and a meteorologist, followed.  Derogatory terms were used to describe Grace.

A call from former Dallas Cowboys player Tony Dorsett opened another segment.  This segued into a discussion about a video of a car driving the wrong way down a highway, filled with profane commentary on the driver. This led to a critique of news media's teasing of stories, contrasted with their own style, and a caller's comment about the showâ€™s teasing of bits, eliciting a vulgar response. A listener called about a sign predicting the end of the world on May 21st, 2011.  This sparked a lengthy, profane discussion of biblical prophecy and morality, along with mockery of a related pamphlet.  The group's radio show number was provided.  A trivia segment followed, focusing on Americans' spiritual beliefs, culminating in a discussion of God and natural disasters.  Further discussions of end-of-the-world scenarios and beliefs, along with additional callers discussing topics like heaven, the soul, and a prostate exam, concluded the segment. The show ended with discussion of a graphic accident video and sexually explicit comments.  Several references to other media personalities and shows were also made throughout the broadcast.  The final mention of "Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Virus. Sirius. Sirius XM" likely refers to the show's branding and broadcast platform.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense, though.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  The crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.

No, I heard unseasonably cold until like Tuesday.  I know.  And then that's it.  And that pisses me off because it's like, it's spring.  It should start, you know, maybe you get one of those days in the upper or mid-60s.  Hey, hey, this part's my favorite part.  Come on.  You don't fade this out.  You're going to have a ball today. 
[00:03:30]  Tomorrow is Saturday.  Right, right.  And then what?  Don't talk on Monday.  Hey.  I'll be Rebecca Black.  Hey.  Yeah.  Stupid Blacks.  Stupid Blacks running the song.  Let me grow.  We want Rebecca Black.  We want Rebecca Black.  We want Rebecca Black.  Come on, come on, y'all.

[00:04:30]  It's going to bother people.  Weekend.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  And statutory rape.  Statutory rape.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Did I sing that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's give it up for Rebecca Black and Friday Friday. 
[00:05:00]  That's great stuff right there.  It's awesome.  Man.  People are pissed.  That got me energized.  That song is stupid catchy, man.  Oh, you'll love it.  I call it stupid catchy.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Fun.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Party.  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  Do we want it again?  What do you think?  No, I just want the hook, though.  That black shit is not my cup of tea and my pop songs.  At least the rap part is very limited.  It's very short.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Is there a black person in the video? 
[00:05:30]  I think like one, right?  The guy rapping?  Yeah, the guy rapping.  And then it's all just little white girls.  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  It's like the best video I've ever seen in my life.  Why isn't Sirius Hits 1 playing that around the clock?  They should be rocking it.  Heavy rotation.  That thing is catchy.  Yeah.  It's catchy like the AIDS.  Like the AIDS?  Like the AIDS.  Is Spidey okay today?  I don't think so.  Oh, my God.  What a clusterfuck.  We here in New York have what they call Broadway. 
[00:06:00]  Uh, uh, uh, Broadway.  Broadway, yeah.  And, uh, they're putting on the most expensive Broadway show ever made.  It's this Spider-Man fucking thing.  U2's involved with the music and a lot of money's been dumped into this.  It's the most technologically advanced Broadway show.  Spidey's got to fucking fly around.  He sure does.  If Spidey ain't flying by his web, no one wants to see it.  And, uh, it's still in previews.  Still in previews.  I think they wanted to open by now, but they're trying to work out the kinks. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And they've been working out the kinks for a long time.  They've, they've, uh, canned the choreographer.  They've changed directors.  They've, uh, switched shit around.  Multiple people have been injured, uh, and, and taken off.  Spidey himself is in a back brace.  Spidey, yeah.  Spidey.  Spidey man himself is all fucked up.  And then, uh, the lead, uh, the, the chick lead fell and injured herself.  And she ran.  Yeah.  We saw her running down Broadway.  Saying, fuck this.  Get me out of here. 
[00:07:00]  Fuck this.  I'm going back to dinner theater in Branson, Missouri.  I'm going back to Shakespeare in the Park.  I don't need this shit.  Did she quit?  Fuck this.  Oh, yeah.  She did.  Ouch.  That's one of many things that happened with this production.  Well, the new one, Obie was telling me this morning, is fantastic.  I got this.  It's every day.  It's something new.  Spidey star left hanging in play flub.  Flub.  You never want to have a flub.  I guess what happened, the troubled Broadway show Spider-Man turned off the dark, endured  yet another embarrassment during a special performance when a camera flash from the audience 
[00:07:30]  distracted an actor during a mid-air move.  Why would you allow cameras if this is so, like, involved?  They tell people not to, uh, take pictures.  An actor portraying the superhero was engaged in an aerial battle with the evil Green Goblin.  What?  When Spidey missed his landing spot and was left to dangle.  You know, gravity seems to be this show's biggest problem.  The law of gravity.  Do you think that, uh, takes the illusion away when you see Spider-Man just dangling?  Dangling.  It makes him look less powerful. 
[00:08:00]  Two union guys helping him on a ladder.  Right.  Pushing him to his perch.  It makes him look silly.  And not only was he dangling, he was trapped in his airborne pose for nearly five minutes.  You think he was still trying to stay in character?  Like, doing those things with his wrists?  Like, he's flinging web all over?  I think for the first minute.  For the first minute.  And then he just went, ah, fuck.  And then you just hear him go, ah, fuck!  Yeah.  The crowd of, ah, bah, bah, the aerial system is so sophisticated that if a flying maneuver 
[00:08:30]  is off by even a couple of inches, it automatically shuts down.  Safety always comes first.  Yeah.  The first spokesman Rick, blah, blah, blah, told the Daily.  So there you go.  Spidey was left dangling last night.  Yeah.  Poor, poor bastard.  Is he okay?  Uh, yeah, he's probably running from the show also.  You just see people in various costumes, Spider-Man costumes, running out of the front door.  Running.  You see the doors just fly open and, ah!  They just run for their lives. 
[00:09:00]  God, fuck that.  I still want to see the dumb thing.  Yeah.  Well, who, at this point, I think.  Friday, Friday, Friday.  Sorry.  Yeah, I think at this point, it's, ah, everybody wants to see this just because, you, odds are  there's going to be a disaster.  Well, you know it's making a lot of money in previews.  Yeah.  You do know that, but.  Because people want to see it fuck up.  But, ah, they've spent a shitload of money to get this whole thing going.  So it's kind of one of these things.  Is it going to be like, um, the new Cats? 
[00:09:30]  Cats on Broadway?  Yeah, is it going to be like that with a bunch of Asian people falling asleep in the front  row and just like other people there just to see if shit fucks up?  You know, you want to see if Rum Tum Tugger falls off the stage?  Rum Tum Tugger.  But how do you know that?  I saw Cats so many times.  I never saw Cats.  Did you really?  Oh, I laughed.  I cried.  I felt great about myself.  Why'd you see it?  Now and forever at the Winter Garden Theater.  What's wrong with you?  Why, though?  It seemed like a great white trash Long Island thing to do for a date. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  And it was.  Believe me.  I've talked about it before.  If you're from Long Island and you got yourself a limo, got all gussied up, and took a girl  into the city to see cats.  Really?  And then dinner at the Russian Tea Room.  You were fucking styling.  That was a Long Island white trash thing to do.  Oh, my God.  I never saw Cats, though.  I didn't either.  Was there aerial?  All right. 
[00:10:30]  We get it.  Yeah, there was some airborne shit.  They flew some cat up on a...  Oh, right, right.  This one.  This is going great. 
[00:11:00]  Big, big one.  Build cars.  Build cars.  Build cars.  Build cars.  Build cars. 
[00:11:30]  Build cars.  And then she got launched up into some spacey platform thing, because I think she was dying.  And Gus Asparagus, the cat, was some poor guy, and he wanted to go.  I don't know what the story was.  It was just a bunch of people in smelly costumes.  More importantly, you have musical talent there, sir.  So why don't you upgrade your fucking instrument?  I like this one.  Actually, it's good. 
[00:12:00]  It's a stainless steel.  No, get a real instrument.  Oh, I don't know how to play those.  You only know how to play that?  I only know how to play the tootally-doo flute.  You know why?  Because the slide gives you a lot of latitude.  A lot of room for error.  Yeah, if you're playing a saxophone, you've got to hit the right little buttons and stuff.  This, you can kind of slide into like...  Can you play the toot-toot flute?  What is that thing?  No, the flutophone?  I can play that.  Was it a flutophone? 
[00:12:30]  Like you could go...  Like you could slide around.  You could fucking try to hear it.  And yeah, believe me, a lot of dogs' heads out there turn sideways when I play this fucking thing.  Dennis in Indiana.  Go ahead, Dennis.  Go ahead, Dennis.  Yeah, guys, everything you've done this morning sucks.  It's Friday morning.  Rebecca Black, and now Cass. 
[00:13:00]  Cass has absolutely the worst show ever.  What?  Now it's forever.  Now it's forever at the Winter Garden Theater.  Oh, it's not there anymore.  What happened to forever?  Hey, Dennis, we do this show to amuse each other, and if you just happen to be amused  too, that's great.  Yeah, if you're along for the ride, whatever.  And if not, go find another channel.  We don't give a fuck.  We're like a car that picks up hitchhikers.  Right.  We might not be where you're going, but we could get you close.  I got to...  And then you got to get out.  I got a fat bank account. 
[00:13:30]  I don't give a fuck if you like this or not.  Just fucking go along as long as you can, and then get out.  Get the fuck out.  What is Deep Tracks doing for the people right now?  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Give me the song Deep Tracks is playing right now.  How do we do that?  You can find out?  And I'm a little confused, Anthony.  I'm not really sure.  God, I hope he's on the same page as me today.  I'm not really sure what day it is.  Is it...  It's...  Well, tomorrow's Saturday, and then Sunday comes after that. 
[00:14:00]  So that would make today...  Yesterday, I think, was Thursday.  Friday!  Woo!  Yeah!  You got to get down on Friday.  We got to get down on Friday.  Friday.  Getting down on Friday.  Yeah!  Everybody looking forward to...  The weekend party and party and party and party.  Yeah!  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  We're going forward to the weekend.  Friday, Friday. 
[00:14:30]  You got to get down on Friday.  Yeah!  Everybody looking forward to the weekend.  Weekend, weekend.  Friday.  Friday.  Oh, that's right.  Friday, Friday.  I'm going to warn everyone right now.  If you don't want to hear that 20 times today, you might want to go somewhere else.  You might want to tune out right now.  Oh, just wait until Jimmy's breakfast comes.  What'd you get?  A fried egg, fried egg.  Oh, it's just all going to be about Rebecca Black.  I hate her last name.  And I hope I'm not the only one. 
[00:15:00]  I hope I'm not the only one setting this up today.  Yeah!  I hope people go with that.  I certainly do.  Rare Earth, Get Ready is what Deep Tracks is playing.  Party and party.  I could get into Rare Earth, Get Ready.  One out of a hundred songs I could get into on the Deep Tracks.  I was so disappointed when I got Rare Earth as a gift for Christmas one.  I was fucking like, what is this?  Why would you get Rare Earth for Christmas?  My rare earth.  I thought it was like, I wanted something like a kiss record.  That bothers me too, man.  They thought it was like the hippie on New York.  No, this is kind of good. 
[00:15:30]  Hold on.  I like this.  Never knew a girl could make me feel the way that you do.  You're all right.  You don't like this?  I like this.  I didn't like it when I was ten.  Oh, wow.  No, no, no.  But the point.  You made me feel the way that you do.  It's all right.  Everybody, yeah.  Whenever I'm at what makes my dreams real.  I tell him it's you.  Out of sight.  Out of sight.  What Tweedly D? 
[00:16:00]  You might have like this a ten.  Everybody.  Get ready.  Woo.  Stop me dreaming.  Look into you.  Get ready.  Oh, don't you know.  On my way.  Now that's some what they call classic rock.  All right, listen.  Just two Republicans. 
[00:16:30]  We're going to fuck up this show today.  I want to pay close attention to Deep Tracks today.  And when they're playing something we can get into, I want that song on our show today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rare Earth.  Get ready.  I can do that.  But back to Jimmy.  Why the fuck a whole album of Rare Earth?  That was just a gift.  What else was there?  Well, they had, I don't know.  It was a very disappointing gift.  I was going to say, I don't know what other song.  I didn't like it. 
[00:17:00]  Isn't that a remake, by the way?  Huh?  Is that a remake?  Huh?  Why did I fall for the huh?  Hey, you know what?  Damn.  Do you want to hear something?  Right out of the, right out of the.  I want to hear it's 10 o'clock.  Right out of the.  And he's fart going back into his ass.  Oh, shit.  It didn't sound, it sounded good, yeah.  It was good?  And then he's refueling with more coffee.  It sounded like it could have been a problem, but it wasn't.  Oh, okay. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  I actually had to make a face like, oh, no, I'm safe.  Bill in Philly.  I hope he rocks on the same page today.  I hope he's wide awake.  Up the menu?  Sam.  Another food.  Oh, damn.  Sam's doing a fat guy pose.  This motherfucker better be awake today, because we need him.  Oh, boy.  He needs to be on the same fucking page.  Oh, boy.  It's not just us babbling about some horse shit we did last night.  You're not on the same page.  I didn't even set it up yet.  This is everybody does that one.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, sweetie.  You're not on the same page.  Oh.  Oh, Bill in Philly.  Hey, gentlemen, it's not going to drive unless you're playing.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You've got to play that one today.  And then you hit the song.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't it a coincidence he plays a song where there's a cowbell at the beginning?  You know, because moo.  How about boo?  It's a reach.  Something Iraq can't do. 
[00:18:30]  I'm just kidding.  I don't go for the Iraq jokes.  Really?  At you.  Bless you.  I'm just.  Oh, thank you.  It was a sneeze.  We've got to get to the hook.  Yeah.  At you.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I'm psyched for the weekend.  Can you tell?  Holy shit.  I'm blowing my energy load in the first 15 minutes.  Working for the weekend. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, everybody.  Come on.  We're working for the weekend.  Yeah.  Everyone likes a good weekend song, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this was a big one.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Piece of my head.  Oh, yeah.  Start from start.  What a dumb fucking line that is, too.  You were right, by the way.  The Temptations originally did get ready. 
[00:19:30]  Yes, The Temptations.  What's their version like?  It's a little more Motown.  Do we know Rare Earth better than The Temptations as far as that song goes?  I think you'd know both.  Is this kid on the same page as us today, or what?  Yeah.  You got The Temptations?  A-Rock, you got Temptations version?  I don't want to see one minute today.  He's got the finger up.  We're on fucking fire already.  He's got the finger up.  Is there whipped cream on it from a pie?  Like a young lad from a little rascal's short?  Perhaps Oliver Twist.  He reached into his dirty pockets and came up with a pence. 
[00:20:00]  Please, sir, can I have 20 more?  I've had to lick the pie off Nutsy Fagin's testicles.  He's still doing one minute.  Nutsy Fagin.  Yeah, here we go.  Ooh!  Oh, yeah, we know this.  Yeah, we know this.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do.  You're all right.  Yeah, this is good.  And then they'd have to go and use a different bathroom. 
[00:20:30]  Ah, the good old days.  I decide.  So be fine.  Oh, oh.  Look how they're going to see you.  Yeah.  What happened to Tweedly D and Tweedly Dom?  I don't know.  I think that's the next line.  Oh.  I like how...  It's a good harmony there.  The old colored singers used to be able to hit those harmonies.  What?  Jimmy the Greek talking about Motown. 
[00:21:00]  The coloreds.  It was something about when they used to sing on the plantations.  And person.  And person.  What on fire?  What?  And person.  Keep talking, Jimmy.  Keep talking, Jimmy the Greek.  Yeah, they would sing in the fields while they picked the cat.  And what it did was it gave them soul.  And what?  The network wants to talk to who?  All right.  Now we've got to go to Brian in Philly.  Brian, what's going on?  Brian.  Hey, good morning.  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  Morning, Brian.  Brian, how are you today? 
[00:21:30]  Good morning for the call.  I'm just doing fantastic.  Guten Morgen.  Hey, don't forget that old morning new staple, Monday I've Got Friday on my mind.  Who the fuck does that one?  Is that the Bengals?  You know what?  Not only are we paying attention to deep tracks today and playing Rebecca Black a lot,  I want more Friday songs.  More Friday songs.  What's wrong with the Friday songs we got?  They sound pretty good.  What's some of the mother Friday songs?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:22:00]  Friday.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Monday I've Got Friday on my mind, which is what he said.  Uh-oh.  It's Friday.  I think I'm in love.  What is the poor raking got?  What's that?  What do you got?  I don't know the name of the movie.  Thank God it's Friday.  Back in the disco days.  Oh.  T-G-I-F.  Yeah.  Thank God it's Friday.  Friday.  It was from the movie.  Yep.  Exactly.  Yeah.  We got the Monday one there.  No, that one's not in the system. 
[00:22:30]  It's a country song.  It's in there.  It's in there.  You just don't know who does it.  I got Friday on my mind.  It's a country song.  Is it?  Yeah.  Is it George Jones?  Holy shit.  I don't know.  Did you just give me back?  I think I did.  You got me back.  I felt like I did when I said it.  And I cheated because someone's had George Jones.  I usually don't cheat, to be honest with you.  I usually give a lot of credit on the show, but I cheated.  Yeah.  I did cheat that time.  It's hard to not take a glance over.  I cheated.  I know. 
[00:23:00]  You got to cheat every once in a while.  You got to take a look at what's going on until you're right and to your left.  Sometimes I look down and see the chat and I'm like, ah, cheated.  Is it George Jones?  Yeah.  See, he rocks down on the same page as us.  I don't know what.  We got high energy today.  He's not on the same book.  He's just staring at screens in there.  He's a sloth.  Give him a break.  He just woke up.  Oh, holy shit.  Even Sam couldn't contain his laughter at that one.  Give him a break.  He just woke up.  You know what?  I don't blame him or anyone else. 
[00:23:30]  Why give it your all?  You're right.  When there's no bosses around, of course this is what's going to happen.  Why give it your all when you've been shit on for so long?  You're right.  I haven't seen a boss in weeks around here.  I never thought I'd say this, but E-Rock's probably the smartest guy here.  He's just coasting.  E-Rock, if E-Rock was a roller coaster, he'd never be the part that goes, chick, chick,  chick, chick, chick, chick.  He's the chr.  Just momentum.  Just momentum.  All kinetic energy.  No effort.  All kinetic energy.  That's what he does when he wakes up.  He gets out of bed and he tilts forward and then just goes for the rest of the day. 
[00:24:00]  That's it.  Hey, remember the guy that was really mad at us?  What?  Oh, Jesus Christ, that's a lot of people.  He said the star of the show sucks.  Yes.  With the cats and the...  He took our advice.  He's back.  Oh, he did.  Dennis, you took our advice.  Where'd you go?  Hey, right here.  Okay.  What are you doing instead of listening to us?  Because you took our advice, which I respect that, actually.  I can barely hear it, but I hear...  I hear it's Rammstein. 
[00:24:30]  Rammstein.  Okay.  Rammstein.  All right.  See, you're enjoying your morning.  We're enjoying our morning.  That's it.  There you go.  That's it.  Everyone's happy now.  I took your advice.  And I respect that.  Good job.  I really do.  Instead of bitching and complaining, you do what you got to do.  Hey, thanks, boys.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  I don't see him calling into the station that's playing Rammstein, though.  No.  What is Deep Tracks playing?  Where are we at with Deep Tracks?  My people here are helping me, but now they gave up.  Deep Tracks.  What are they playing?  Still.  Is it still that song? 
[00:25:00]  I guess it's long.  I don't know.  I've never heard of it before.  Laura Nairo sings the country.  This is nice.  Deep Tracks.  I saw Eric mouth.  Oh, fuck.  So I guess he wasn't planning on getting a live version.  And his mic unplugged.  He's a disaster in there.  It's like Apollo 13 in his little capsule.  Wait, wait, wait.  The song changed. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  A bell on that.  How can you listen?  How many people would actually stay tuned to Deep Tracks with that song playing?  I don't even know what that...  First of all, I've never heard of her before.  So then you've got to get the people that know who she is.  What's her name?  Laura Nairo.  Nairo.  And then...  Never heard of her.  And now the people that know who she is,  then they have to decide if they like that song enough to stay.  They have to have like a dozen people listening to that channel.  I think the only people listening would listen to that.  Like, you know what I mean?  They don't punch around Deep Tracks going, 
[00:26:00]  maybe I'll hear something I know.  They just stay there?  The whole thing behind Deep Tracks is you're not going to know the songs.  So it's people that don't want to know the songs.  We knew Get Ready.  Yeah, but on Deep Tracks...  I'm surprised that's a Deep Tracks song.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of a little more popular.  What, did you guys renegotiate your contract?  Too much energy.  Hell no, man.  It's Friday, Friday.  Wait, it's what?  I think it's the day before Saturday and the day after Thursday.  See, he's just not...  Ah, yeah.  Woo! 
[00:26:30]  Front seat, back seat, I don't even give a shit.  Where are my friends?  Party and party and party.  Yeah!  Fun, fun.  Gained.  Yeah.  I'll be blacked out on Saturday because of Friday.  Yeah.  Could work road sodas in there for everybody.  Oh, my God.  She should sing about road sodas. 
[00:27:00]  Road sodas.  Rule.  Party and party.  Yeah!  Party and party and party.  Fun, fun.  Fun, fun.  It's fun.  She's saying it.  It's got to be true.  What are road sodas?  Oh, God.  We were douche-chilling about that.  No, tell me.  No, you don't want to know.  I do.  Well, see, years ago...  You missed that show, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Years ago, the Obster...  No, no, no.  It's okay.  We can move on.  The Obster would go out with his friends.  Front seat, back seat.  It didn't matter, man.  That's right.  And instead of saying, let's grab a few beers, they'd go like, hey, let's get some road sodas. 
[00:27:30]  Jimmy's face now looks...  Road sodas?  I already took the beating for this.  Not by Jimmy.  He was out.  Why do I have to take the beating again?  Jimmy should be able to enjoy the douche-chilling...  Why do we have to redo a show?  Because he's in Hollywood.  Of the road soda.  He missed his opportunity.  But other people may not have been listening.  That's true.  There's other people who may be hearing...  Jimmy is representative of certain audience members, too, that might not have heard road  soda.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I'm going to show you my Twitter timeline.  I walked in today and everyone's talking, hey, you're going to get some road sodas the 
[00:28:00]  weekend's here.  Because it's Friday.  A road soda.  We thought we were cool because we called them road sodas.  Road soda.  Did you really?  Grab some road sodas?  Road sodas.  That was cool.  How old were you?  I was old enough to know the difference.  More than two?  Old enough to drive and buy beer.  19, probably.  Let's get us some road sodas.  Whoa, I know what you mean by that.  There's no soda.  It was also code when I was picking up my friends and stuff.  There's parents around.  Hey, let's get some road sodas.  With a convertible pull-up and you're like front seat, back seat, getting some road sodas. 
[00:28:30]  You know what?  Here's how stupid I am.  I really thought you meant soda.  Ew.  No.  I swear to God.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I thought you meant you and your friends were going to grab some sodas.  And I'm like, why would they ride around drinking soda?  No, no.  It's a beer.  You're just making it worse.  Yeah, I called beers road sodas.  Oh, that's pretty hate.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's a cold word, man.  Road sodas.  I took my beating.  I really did.  I took a major beating for that.  I would go like, let's get some road sodas, mother hookah. 
[00:29:00]  And then we went ET-ing at the bars in Huntington.  Oh, elbow titting.  Elbow titting.  Sure.  Elbow titting.  That's fine.  You did ET-ing?  No.  It was more of a, honestly, it was more of a fucking goof.  He'd do CT-ing.  It's very hard to do.  You have to jump up.  But it was more of a goof.  It was more of a goof to see who had balls in a bar.  It wasn't an actual turn on.  It was kind of cool to feel.  Well, we would all hang out at the bar, wherever the fuck we were, and we'd take turns. 
[00:29:30]  Like, all right, it's your turn.  Let's see what you can do.  Well, I was saying on St. Paddy's Day, I inadvertently elbow-titted a fat chick's, the  side of her big fat tit.  She was drunk, and she's being guided along by her friend, and I was going through a crowd,  and it was really tight trying to get across Fifth Avenue to the parade, and it wasn't  even my elbow.  Like, my bicep hit the side of her big, meaty, ample tit, and I felt like it went like,  ch-cum, ch-cum, ch-cum.  Oh, really?  It did the ch-cum, ch-cum, like, back and forth thing. 
[00:30:00]  Nice, right?  Before she went, excuse me!  And then I just put my arm up, like, all right, I acknowledge your excuse me, and then  she goes, fuck you!  And I just turned around, and I said, shut up, you cunt!  Because I was aggravated that I couldn't even get across this parade route of drunks.  These drunks.  And I wasn't drunk, so that upset me, too.  Who was walking her?  Oh, her skinny friend was trying to, like, guide her.  It was great.  It was like a Laurel and Hardy sketch.  I never went for elbow tip, but I liked frontage, which was the grazing. 
[00:30:30]  We used to go grazing.  Grazing?  I liked the hand on the ass cheeks.  Oh, with your bare hand on the ass, right?  The knuckles on the ass cheeks.  Yeah, yeah.  That takes way more balls.  No, in a crowd, you could get away with that.  Hell no, man, because your elbows are...  Oh, hell no!  Elbows are almost at tit level if you're a little taller, like we were.  I would fucking do that in a crowd, though.  Sometimes you can't resist.  Because your knuckles, you have to have your arm all the way down.  No, no, no.  Like you're walking, yeah.  But if there's a lot of people, you can, like, kind of, excuse me, kind of get through 
[00:31:00]  and just brush an ass.  I think they would be more suspicious of that than if their tit got a fucking elbow.  I don't know.  Dude, I got a fucking...  I got a teacher one time.  Oh, jeez.  She was a teacher, and she was wearing a bikini.  What?  They did with swim class.  She was wearing a one-piece bathing suit.  Uh-oh.  And I walked by her on the side of the pool.  We were the only two there.  And you get any braids?  And I fucking gave her a fucking double cheek braids.  How old are you?  You're a little pervert.  I was in high school.  I was probably, like, a sophomore in high school.  What did she do?  I felt her motion turn at me.  Oh. 
[00:31:30]  And look.  And I knew if I turned around, she would have sent me down.  You would have been fucked.  But because I kept going and didn't acknowledge it, I left an ounce of deniability.  Yeah.  And she wasn't sure.  I'll never forget that.  That was so...  Was it hot?  I used to look at her big pussy bulge and her fucking...  Because she had hair.  It was, like, 1984.  So it was puffy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She had a nice...  I still remember her name.  Yeah.  She had a great little ass.  Damn.  Yeah, that's all right.  Short hair.  You know.  You left just enough deniability so she couldn't fucking call you out on it.  I think I even got...  She had one of the greatest ass.  I think I even got a double cheeker on it. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  Like a thunk thunk.  That was, to me, I would jerk off thinking about the great...  Yeah, you get, like, both cheeks and then the crack, you go, like, in and then the cheek.  Oh, wow.  What'd you do?  You almost fingered this girl.  What the fuck are you doing?  You maniac.  That was horrible.  That was a dirty boy.  I love Jimmy.  So elbow titting...  So nasty.  ...seemed...  I couldn't get the sensation through the elbow because it was too hard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was too hard to bump.  Yeah, the hand, you get a lot more cup and ass cheek in the elevator when it's just you  and another guy.  Jesus.  Me and Kenny riding up in the elevator. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  He doesn't argue.  Because he wouldn't even notice.  He puts my hand there.  Yeah, Mark in Ohio.  Mark E.  Hey, morning, fuckers.  Good morning.  We're at Club Soda Kenny's song.  Club Soda Kenny's Friday song...  Is this a clusterfuck?  I think we got it, actually.  Oh, okay.  Do you want the outtakes or the song?  The whole song.  I think the outtakes have been ruined by the 10 o'clock hour where, by the way, Sam is hoarding  stuff now.  Yeah, Sam is now keeping stuff from us to play... 
[00:33:00]  ...to play it on the 10 o'clock hour.  I've noticed it.  What the fuck is that about?  I heard it the other day.  What are you talking about?  And this...  That's supposed to be just a basic wrap-up show, but now we see you're hoarding stuff and saving  it for your little hour show.  And trying to get the likes of J.J. Abrams on his show, because J.J. Abrams is supposed  to come in to our show, and he's saying, like, oh, maybe he's talking to Roland, going,  well, maybe you could book him late so he could carry over and be on his day.  It's not your show. 
[00:33:30]  But also, that way, Ron could talk to him, too.  And then you guys could stay after if you want.  Is this supposed to be something good for me?  I want the exclusive...  Wait, who wants to book J.J. Abrams late so he can stay?  Sam does.  So he could do the 10 o'clock to 10.45, you know, after the O&A show live O&A show thing.  I was probably at least partially joking.  Oh, look at how...  When I said that, he's getting a little nervous.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  But, hold on.  Stay on point.  But you did play the Club Soda Kenny Outtakes on your show. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, because you want backstage stuff on the after show.  Well, not backstage stuff to shit that hasn't happened yet.  That's not backstage.  And not backstage stuff.  That's front stage.  Not backstage stuff people actually want to hear.  Right.  So you're saying that he's taking a recap show, and he's attempting to introduce original content.  Yes!  And remove the recap part.  Yes!  Thank you.  And make it his thing.  Yes.  Yes.  But it was...  If he had it his way, he would just push us out entirely.  Oh, that's what he's doing.  That's neither here nor there. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, he's working slowly.  You really think there's an after show?  It's just special delivery after O&A.  I know!  There's no...  That's ridiculous.  Dave's not on the show.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.  I like how he's getting a little nervous.  Wasn't it still called special delivery before Dave was in the picture?  Yeah.  No, it's called Than and Sam.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You know what?  That's my mistake.  I thought it was.  Wow.  Of course, Than.  Well, I mean...  Saw Than the other day.  He's doing fine.  Literally.  Where did you see him?  I saw him at Travis's birthday party at Dave and Buster's. 
[00:35:00]  Just lurking?  Yeah.  Quietly sitting there, not making any noise?  Than always looks like he's about to fucking murder everybody in the room.  Because he makes no noise.  He's just quietly sitting there.  And they're like, oh, hi.  You've been looking at me for eight minutes.  He is very stealthy for a tall gent.  He really is.  He just blends in.  I thought you were a lamp.  Sorry.  I see him once in a while.  Why don't we...  Why don't we, boy?  We'll start with the Club Soda Candy song.  Plus, not all of the outtakes that you have were played on the after show.  Oh, well, you don't have to... 
[00:35:30]  Well, that's nice of you, Sam.  Thanks for saving us a couple.  We really appreciate it.  We moved on, and you're still explaining yourself.  That show's a little guilt.  That's a little weird.  That's a little like, hey...  And which ones weren't played?  The ones you didn't really like and thought weren't...  No, no, no.  Probably.  I save good stuff for the main show.  Club Soda Candy does Friday.  Did you guys tweak it?  Yeah, yeah.  I made it better.  All right.  Here it is.  Club Soda Candy doing his Friday song.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  7 a.m.  Waking up in the morning.  Gotta be fresh.  Gotta go downstairs.  Gotta have my bowl.  Gotta have some cereal.  It's too fucking fast.  Stick it on.  Everybody's watching.  Gotta go down to the bus stop.  Gotta catch my bus.  I gotta see my friends.  Kicking in the front seat.  Sitting in the back seat.  Gotta make my mind up.  Which seat I can take. 
[00:36:30]  It's Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Friday, Friday.  Gonna get down on Friday.  Everyone's looking forward to the weekend.  And partying, partying, partying, partying.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Look forward to the weekend.  745, we're driving on the highway. 
[00:37:00]  Cruising so fast.  I want time to fly.  Fun, fun.  Think about fun.  You know what it is.  I got this.  I got this.  You got this.  My friend is by my right.  I got this.  You got this.  Now you know it.  Kicking in the front seat.  Sitting in the back seat.  Gotta make my mind up.  Which seat can I take?  It's Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday. 
[00:37:30]  Everyone's looking forward to the weekend.  Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Party, partying, yeah.  Partying, partying, yeah.  Fun, fun, fun.  Looking forward to the weekend.  And, wow.  What a mess.  That was good.  That was a car crash, man.  Troy, because he technically did all, like, Troy's the producer behind it. 
[00:38:00]  And he's like an audio guy.  Right.  He hates this song.  Like, what we just handed in, he hates it.  And he hated doing it.  Why?  Because he's a professional?  Yeah, because he doesn't, like, I told him it's supposed to not, it's Kenny.  Like, it's not going to sound good.  Yeah.  He was expecting some nice polished thing.  Like, he wanted something that sounds good.  And you did tell us before the show you hated Troy's version, right?  Well, the first version was...  I think Troy needs to know that.  I told him.  The first version was more auto, completely auto-tuned. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, well, what about, how come there's no auto-tune, really?  Because she's severely auto-tuned in this, but Kenny, not so much.  We could hand in the original, it didn't sound as good.  This one is up and down a little bit.  It didn't capture the essence of the Kenny.  It was just...  Oh, the auto-tune, it could have been anybody, just auto-tuned.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That makes sense.  All right, well...  That makes sense.  All right.  Wow.  But Troy was very...  He didn't really even want to hand it in.  Yeah.  But I told him it's not...  It's Kenny, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I understand. 
[00:39:00]  It's supposed to sound like this.  I understand.  We should head toward our first break, because now we need a nap.  Head toward it?  Yeah, well...  I don't have a sandwich in front of me, though.  Then let's keep going.  I don't have a sandwich.  All right, then we keep going.  Because then we've got to, like, shove it in our fucking faces.  Then we keep going.  Let's say hi to this dude from Madison, Wisconsin.  What's up, brother?  Madison, Wisconsin.  Hi.  Hello, boys.  Hi.  Hey, man.  I just wonder why you're so down on the deep tracks.  There was a whole generation worth of music out there before you started spinning alternative 
[00:39:30]  tracks.  Oh, boy.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, boy.  That's a fucking cheap shot right there.  We were around for that music, sir.  You'd think too much of me.  You were around in 66?  I worked at three homes of rock and roll, sir.  Yeah, but I'm talking...  And a station that is the only station that really rocks.  I played some of those deep tracks stuff.  The problem with deep tracks, they go way too fucking deep. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  They only need to go a little deep, and it would be very enjoyable.  But Opie, it's a channel that's not single-minded.  That would...  I'm not...  He sounds like he's getting on you, Opie.  I think he might be, yeah.  He's getting on you.  I'm not talking...  I don't want...  Yeah, you're right.  I don't want songs I've heard a million fucking times, but there's also a lot of songs that  you haven't really heard a lot of that deep tracks does play, but then they go way  deeper than that even, and that's what's annoying to me.  Friday's not about taking shit from a guy like this.  It's about kicking in the front seat, kicking in the back seat. 
[00:40:30]  What?  It's not about taking sarcastic, snarky shit from the likes of the listeners.  Well, I meant to be sarcastic.  Oh, okay.  I was still laying in bed.  I'm terribly sorry.  How about this?  How about we do a little deep tracks thing right now?  What song are they playing right now?  I don't know.  Let me check the pad date.  I'll change.  Wait.  Is this what they're playing right now?  It's called Have a Good Time by Wet Willie. 
[00:41:00]  Now, would you sit through this ad?  I actually probably would.  Sounds like it has a cool groove right here.  I'd probably listen to this to see where it goes.  Yeah.  I don't mind deep tracks.  It's kind of what satellite's supposed to be.  You're playing weird shit.  That was my point. 
[00:41:30]  Eclectic.  But they go way too fucking deep is what I'm saying.  This reminds me of something.  It's almost like the song from Fast Times.  What?  When Hamilton was washing his car or something.  Like, it sounds kind of like a little...  I'm out on this one.  No, no.  It sounds familiar.  What song was he doing?  I don't remember, but it's kind of a...  It's just kind of one of those cruising songs. 
[00:42:00]  All right, all right.  Yeah.  I don't mind this.  All right, all right.  I see Sam Bozzi here.  This is good news.  We should take a break.  Oh, yeah.  When we come back, I want to discuss what I read about someone trying to be poetic about  Liz Taylor's death.  Oh, really?  Just fucking stop.  I fucking hate people trying to make more out of death.  Death is what it is, man.  It is what it is.  You're fucking...  You're laying in a box.  Yeah.  She's up in heaven wincing at Richard Burton walking over to her, thinking that fucking 
[00:42:30]  heavenly black eye is coming.  Oh, did he love to slug a bitch?  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's been some things.  Oh, did he love to slug a broad?  Just the stupid people going, well, now Liz and Michael are together and all that crap.  Come on.  Well, I'll read it because it's one line, one part.  The guy, someone was reading it and he said that they're in heaven now, she's on a throne  like Cleopatra, and Michael is dancing around her.  Ew, that conjures up a creepy scene. 
[00:43:00]  But that sounds like a retard's dream.  Retard?  Did you say retard?  Yeah, retard's dream.  You're just sitting in a chair and someone's dancing around you?  We should break it down, though.  You know, Michael Jackson was into some weird shit.  I don't think he wants Liz Taylor, you know, taking a peek at him while he's trying to get  some weird shit done in heaven.  Yeah.  If you really want to break it down.  That's the last thing he wants, is that brought around.  Heaven for Michael Jackson would be different than heaven for other people. 
[00:43:30]  Exactly.  Believe me.  Of course.  He'd be the fucking seat of a hobby horse.  That's what his face would be.  Of course.  He's hanging out in the SIDS part of heaven.  He's getting them before anybody else did.  Of course.  Oh, they thought it was just a cough, did they?  Oh, God.  Stop trying to be poets about fucking heaven.  It's just a...  The fact that they think she's sitting in a chair. 
[00:44:00]  Just sitting there all old, like Cleopatra, while that fucking creep, that skin-dying  creep, dances in a circle.  It's moonwalking in front of her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  Stop.  Stop.  They don't care about AIDS on Earth anymore?  No.  She's supposed to sit in a big chair while fucking...  While old white chest dances around her?  Why did you do it, Michael?  It was so snug around my penis.  Break time. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  On this...  Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  They got to get down on Friday. 
[00:45:00]  We're looking forward to the weekend, Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday, everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend, Friday, Friday, getting down on Friday, everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  The Virus Sirius XM, this is the Opinion 3 Show, Opinion 3. 
[00:45:30]  The Virus Sirius XM, this is the Opinion 3. 
[00:46:00]  No, I don't.  Andy Van Halen.  I like maybe five of their songs.  That's not bad, though, for a band.  Van Halen 2, 32 years ago today.  Was there a drop-off between 1 and 2 hit?  Yeah.  What was on 1, Running With The Devil?  Every song was a hit on number 1.  Give me the list of 1 and 2, if you don't mind.  I want to see if there was a drop-off.  Because I don't remember.  Every song a hit on Van Halen 1.  Every song! 
[00:46:30]  This is abysmal.  All right.  Yeah, all right.  You got Van Halen 1, you got Running With The Devil, Eruption, You Really Got Me, Ain't Talking About Love, I'm the 1.  That's a great side of music right there.  Which one's I'm the 1?  I don't remember.  That's a cool song.  There's a couple good songs.  That would be a deep track.  And then your B-side.  B-side.  Wow.  Jamie's Crying.  Atomic Punk.  Feel Your Love Tonight.  Little Dreamer.  Ice Cream Man.  And On Fire.  Fuck, that's a great album.  That is a full album of every song you know.  It's amazing.  I would ride that whole album right there. 
[00:47:00]  Fuck yeah!  I might pop to the next track, maybe On Fire or something.  Now, what's on 2?  2 is You're No Good.  You're No Good.  Wait, how does your name mean?  I don't know.  Do we have that ear rock?  I'm sure we do.  Dance the Night Away.  Oh, does that fucking stink?  Somebody Give Me a Doctor.  Bottoms Up.  Oh yeah, I kind of like this song. 
[00:47:30]  I remember this.  A little fucking weird.  Yeah.  Dance the Night Away.  Bottoms Up.  Out of Love Again.  Light Up the Sky.  I don't even know most of these.  Diamond Dave wanted to just dance the night away.  Yeah, that's what we should be playing.  That's fucking...  Spanish Fly, DOA, Women in Love and Beautiful Girls.  Yeah, there's a drop-off.  There's a major drop-off.  Big drop-off.  Every song on number one was a hit.  This is...  This is Dance the Night Away.  Dance...  The...  You Know It Anywhere Eddie Van Halen guitar of the late 70s was pretty fucking good. 
[00:48:00]  He was very good.  But just lyrically they were awful.  I liked Van Halen for what it was.  I used to wear those big, goofy 70s headphones and just crank fucking Van Halen 1 and just  lay back, fucking smoke some weed and listen to Van Halen 1.  Yeah!  I was cool back then. 
[00:48:30]  This chorus is abysmal.  The song is okay.  The chorus just fucking makes my stomach hurt.  They decided to write some hits.  Just chorus.  Well, there was the Van Halen harmonies.  Yeah.  There's all the sound of Van Halen.  I wouldn't sit through Van Halen 2.  No way.  It's horrendous.  I think it's the most...  First album, definitely, but not this one.  They're the Liz Taylor of heavy metal bands.  Just fucking overrated.  Now the harmonies sound like...  Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance. 
[00:49:00]  You know, because his tongue was cut out.  I know.  It's just no mercy.  Catchy, but you want to rock, right?  I think it's horrendous.  Yeah.  I think they came back for their third album, though, if I'm not mistaken.  What was on the third album?  I forgot what it was even called.  I think they finally gave up on Van Halen 1, Van Halen 2.  I don't think they did Van Halen 3, right?  Was it called OU812, or was that later? 
[00:49:30]  That was...  Oh, dude, that's the Sammy Hager.  Yeah, another fucking...  Sammy.  Women and children first.  What are the songs on that one?  All right.  And the Cradle Will Rock, I like that.  Everybody Wants Some, I kind of like that.  Fools, I don't know that song.  Romeo Delight, I don't know.  Tor, Tor, you know any of these?  Play one of those first two, E-Rock?  Loss of Control, Take Your Whiskey Home, Could This Be Magic.  Wow.  Oh, play Could This Be Magic.  You know this one?  No, but it's got to be a love song.  It fucking sounds...  It sounds... 
[00:50:00]  And in a simple...  Milk-curdling.  Rhyme.  Wow, another drop-off.  Ooh.  Oh, another one that they try to do.  Summertime Sitback Needs Something to Keep...  That's what it kind of sounds like they were going for.  Let's see.  I like the guitar work.  Yeah.  On the islands on a cool summer night, but you don't got to hurry, take your time.  He can't sing.  All you need is on the menu, and you'll get it tonight, but you got women's on your mind. 
[00:50:30]  Women's on your mind?  Yeah, trying to be bluesy.  Trying to be black?  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  Yeah.  This is very bluesy.  Yeah.  No, I like bluesy.  This isn't bluesy.  I mean, you're right.  It's bluesy, but they're failing miserably.  It's like bluegrass.  Yeah, they're failing miserably.  Yeah, they're right up there.  It's Sabbath.  Fucking.  Right up there. 
[00:51:00]  This is just as good as fucking Never Say Die or Technical Ecstasy.  You're right.  Let's go to their fourth album, The David Lee Roth Years.  What's the fourth album now?  There's a drop-off between two and that album.  I think Ice Cream Man was a big song, wasn't it?  Fair Warning.  That's right.  Okay, so let's look at Fair Warning now.  Mean Street.  I liked Mean Street.  Dirty Movies.  Sinner's Swing.  Wow, I don't know these songs.  Hear About It Later.  Unchained was kind of cool, no?  What was that one?  Yeah, that was... 
[00:51:30]  Push Comes to Shove.  So This Is Love was not bad.  They try to put so many love songs into the context of rock, hard rock.  But that was done back then.  What is So This Is Love?  Is that a big song?  Yeah, you would know this one.  Platter.  Ah, yeah.  But a lot of duds on this album as well.  Yeah.  I hate when he talks things.  He always talks things. 
[00:52:00]  Baby looking so fan.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  It's left to live.  I'm a living proof.  Catch that smell and I have the groove.  Beat double tape, but you keep on walking.  I'm in love.  Lord, so I'm overdone.  This is love.  I need your lovin'.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  All right, Dave.  Oh, I need your lovin'. 
[00:52:30]  That's fine, that's fine.  Are they really working on a new album?  I don't know, I don't.  We're back!  Better than ever.  This would be a good one.  We're back!  Back to back.  Looking at each other over the shoulder.  Oh, God, oh, hey, Jesus.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time. 
[00:53:00]  It's nice.  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  We're a little bit older, but we ain't much wider.  We're back!  We're better than ever.  We're back!  We're back!  Together forever.  We're back!  We're back!  This is just as good as any Van Halen tune. 
[00:53:30]  You know what, it's better.  I was about to say, if you pump up Jimmy's vocals a little bit, tweak it a little bit,  it's just as good as some of these other tracks that never did shit on those albums.  Of course.  Of course.  I completely agree.  Yeah.  All right, there was something else.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  Brian, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hold on, before I go to you, I've got to get a serious call in.  Stay right there.  I'm going right back to you.  Bill on Long Island.  Go ahead, Bill. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, Bill.  Bill's very upset with us.  Bill.  I'm not very upset.  I just don't know why you guys are ripping them apart.  They're one of the best fans around.  They're really not, though.  They're really...  They really are.  Absolutely.  You've read quite a bit of a dozen good songs.  Musically, Bill, Bill, Bill, I think as time goes on, you learned that they might have  been a bit overrated.  The first album, we all agreed was pretty damn good, and then there's some major drop-offs  happening.  You blew by Mean Streets.  I said I liked Mean Streets. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Which one is Mean Streets?  You put on the shittiest song on the album.  You put on whatever that ballad was or whatever, but there was...  All right, Bill, why don't we do this?  What's your favorite Van Halen song of all time?  Not off one, though.  Right.  Yeah, I'm agreeing with you guys that know Black Sabbath.  They're completely, completely different.  I don't think they were trying to be Black Sabbath, so that's okay.  No, I'm just saying.  They obviously wanted some hits.  Some rock hits.  Yeah, come on.  They're overrated.  Their music speaks for itself, though. 
[00:55:00]  I mean...  It does.  He's a genius.  He's a musical...  He was a great guitarist, and the drums are good, the bass...  I mean, they're great musicians.  I just think that they were very overrated.  People mentioned them with Sabbath and Zeppelin, and they should not be mentioned with those bands.  They were kind of like a...  Yeah, they weren't heavy, and they weren't like a...  I don't know, like one of those hair bands of the 80s.  No, they were chicks...  The chicks loved Van Halen.  Absolutely, but I mean, there was talent.  I mean, it wasn't bad going to a Van Halen show.  You know, let's be honest with each other. 
[00:55:30]  There was a lot of stuff to check out, but...  You're the showman, man.  I'm not going to be a guy that's going to sit there and say, like, back when that first album came out,  and even the second album and stuff, that I was going, oh, Van Halen, these guys suck.  I was a complete fucking fan.  But as the...  You can look back and say, you know, oh, you know, he's...  All that shit, you know, especially...  I think he's missing our point, though.  The point we're trying to make is the first album was really amazing,  and then there was a drop-off as the albums continued to come out.  With each album having a couple rock hits, absolutely, like Dance the Night Away and stuff, but... 
[00:56:00]  First album was good.  I think amazing compared to...  Hold on, bro.  I think amazing compared to the rest of the catalog, but I think the first album was good.  I think the first album was great.  Jamie's Crying is okay.  I'll say the first album was great.  Yeah, I would, too.  First album was a classic...  Like, that can be put up there with one of the best rock albums made.  That year, maybe?  No, I think ever.  No.  To be honest with you, at the time, especially at the time, a lot of the best rock albums 
[00:56:30]  ever made, you listen now and they sound dated and shit.  That was a sound that just wasn't being done at the time.  It was groundbreaking.  It was fucking amazing to listen to.  Wait, what else is on there?  Jamie's Crying, Running With The Devil.  Yeah, every song was ahead.  Yeah, we ran down the list and every song was pretty damn good, man.  You probably just weren't into that sound or anything.  Running With The Devil, Eruption was a cool instrumental.  You Really Got Me, they did that song justice, certainly.  That was a good song.  Ain't Talking About Love was hard. 
[00:57:00]  That was cool.  Let's hear that one.  I'm The One was cool.  I liked the whole first song.  I don't know I'm The One either.  And then Jamie's Crying, Atomic Punk, Feel Your Love Tonight, Little Dreamer, Ice Cream  Man, and On Fire.  Yeah, that's just...  That's a solid album.  What?  Every hit, every song's a hit.  And you say that about most bands as far as the albums go.  But, Bill, once again, I think you're missing our point.  We were looking at their whole catalog, and then the second album came out, there was a  drop-off.  Then the third album came out, a drop-off from the second album.  That's all we're saying.  I think, you know what?  And then they got extremely poppy, and they lost all that heavy guitar stuff. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  When they started throwing keyboards in there.  And then they went keyboards in there.  Yeah.  It was lame as hell.  I mean, so at the end, I can absolutely agree with you, but, you know, I'm not like, I  never had that poacher hanging on my wall or anything, but I mean, as far as like, remembering  back, you know, when I was in high school and blasting in my radio, you know, my car and  stuff, that was, you know...  I like Panama as my favorite Van Halen song.  I like that.  I really do.  I like Jump.  I honestly do. 
[00:58:00]  Panama, the fucking beat of Panama.  Dude, Panama...  Jump?  That was when they...  Jump isn't as good as the other songs.  Panama, I put up there with any song they ever did.  Yeah, I like Panama.  The fucking beat is phenomenal, dude.  I think they were done.  No, they weren't.  No, man, because it's sort of...  They were sort of rocking again.  Yeah, the fucking beat of it was good.  Go back to Mean Street and play a couple of songs on Mean Street.  That was...  That weren't...  All right, Bill.  Those were incredible songs.  All right, Bill, you're panicking.  Yeah, Bill, thanks. 
[00:58:30]  Enjoy your day, Bill.  I'm obsessed.  Yeah, Panama's all right.  I like this.  It's my favorite Van Halen song.  I'm not saying it's the best.  It's the one I like the best.  I like the beat.  What's Ice Cream, man?  I've heard this a million times.  Maybe I'm being too harsh on Van Halen.  I'm your Ice Cream, man.  Oh, that one stunk.  If I remember right.  Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't a big fan.  All right, one more.  Brian, go ahead, Brian.  Back to you, sir. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, hey.  You guys mentioned Running with the Devil.  I know you played it before, but you've got to play it again.  The David Lee Roth lyrics, where he's just singing, and there's no music in the background.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like that, yeah.  You got that?  The first time I heard you guys play that, it was the funniest thing ever.  All right, you know where it is, Iraq?  Yeah, it's David Lee Roth's vocals, Isolated, for Running with the Devil.  Yeah.  But this is how fucking these songs are made, you know?  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I think just about every band wouldn't want their isolated vocals put out there.  No, no.  What Darrow would sound like, Isolated?  I was just thinking that.  Couldn't sound any worse.  Are you got it?  Brian, for you, we do this today.  Thank you.  I live my life like there's no tomorrow. 
[01:00:00]  And all I've got, I had to steal.  At least I don't need to beg or borrow.  Yes, I'm living at a base that kills.  Oh, yeah.  Hello. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Woo-hoo.  Running with the devil.  I'll tell you all about it.  I found the simple life.  It's so simple.  When I jumped out on that road.  It's cool, though.  It's not bad.  I got no love.  It's not, because it's the exact album track.  This is the fucking track that went on the album. 
[01:01:00]  Ain't got nobody waiting at home.  Sounds good here.  Yeah.  Except for that part.  You got that weird double fucking screamy voice.  God damn it, baby.  No, I ain't lying to you.  I'm only going to tell you one time.  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  It's that growl going. 
[01:01:30]  Aha.  Woo.  It's like he has Tourette's.  A big kiss.  They have a wacky whistle.  Forget about that.  There it is.  You can hear the wacky whistle spinning.  You know what?  I found the simple life.  What's so simple?  No. 
[01:02:00]  When I jumped out on that road.  Got no love.  No love you'd call real.  Got nobody waiting at home.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I'm running.  Oh, yeah.  That's great. 
[01:02:30]  Come on.  Run on one more time.  He fucking...  He nailed it.  Come on.  Yeah, I think so.  He nailed it.  That's not embarrassing at all.  Because those are the actual tracks that made it on the album.  Sure.  Well, that's how they put a song together, as we all know.  That's pretty good.  Does Ice Cream Man go like...  Summertime sit back, need something to keep you cool.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Dedicate one.  Because I think he's talking about his keg. 
[01:03:00]  Of course.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Double on top.  His push-up is a cock.  Need something to keep you cool.  Oh, you got...  Better look at now.  He's checking it out.  If Dave's got some of you, I'll tell you what it is.  I'm your ice cream man.  Stop me when I'm passing by.  Ice cream means cum, I think.  I'm your ice cream man.  Stop me when I'm passing by.  I don't think he's literal on this one.  I thought he's literally an ice cream man.  That's all right.  See, his flavors are guaranteed to satisfy.  It's different. 
[01:03:30]  That's not bad.  Yeah.  All right, we got Ken on Long Island.  Has a question for Jimmy.  Kenny.  Yeah, you're talking about Van Halen.  Yes, I am, Kenny.  They're singing about black magic, and it's so cheesy.  You have to look at the time, though.  When Sabbath was singing about black magic, that was like 1969, 1970.  There were a lot of wizards.  Yeah, it was just...  That was what they were singing about, the occult.  Yeah, but they didn't know anything about it.  I mean, and the lyrics are just so awful. 
[01:04:00]  It's a joke.  Even they sound so outdated now, too.  That's silly.  You just sound silly.  He's not a very good singer, either.  I'll take...  Lyrically, I'll take everything Geezer wrote over anything written by Van Halen.  Anything.  I'll take...  Give me the lyrics of Paranoid.  I mean, the album.  Or give me the lyrics of fucking Master of Reality.  Or Sabbath Buddy Sabbath.  And I'll take that over anything.  I'll take that wizard.  Here's the wizard.  Funny clothes, tinkling bell, never talking, just keeps walking. 
[01:04:30]  He keeps walking, yeah.  It's the wizard.  It's the wizard.  It's the wizard.  It's the wizard.  He walked.  It's the wizard.  Yes.  Well, the devil ran.  In Van Halen.  What's that?  He's singing about Mickey Mouse at the Magic Kingdom.  This guy's nailing you, Jimmy.  He's really not.  He's really not.  He's really not.  The wizard happens to be a very good song.  There's great harmonica playing.  Now, who is Iron Man?  I don't know.  I think it was...  Iron Man is a loser.  Those are the worst lyrics. 
[01:05:00]  It was about...  Those are the worst lyrics, huh?  No, no, no.  I think it's about somebody...  Sir, can you let me explain, please, before you babble over my head?  I know what it's about.  I know what it's about.  Okay, let's hear your explanation.  Everyone's so confrontational.  They really are.  Come to save the world, but he decides to destroy it instead.  Yes.  So this guy knows Sabbath.  Not really.  He's quoting fucking Iron Man and the wizard.  Yeah, but did he used to like Sabbath and something happened?  Because you kind of know about the band.  They're okay.  I mean, I kind of like the stuff I thought about the witch magic, like Sweet Leaf. 
[01:05:30]  Sweet Leaf.  I love Sweet Leaf.  Even though Dave Mustaine sings it better than Ozzy.  Oh, boy.  That's a great song.  Dave Mustaine?  Yeah, Megadeth.  Check out the Megadeth version.  Of what?  Sweet Leaf?  Paranoid.  Yeah, of Paranoid.  Oh, let's check that out.  What the hell?  I don't think he sings it better than Ozzy, but...  Oh, boy.  So you're not going to offend me.  You can't compare...  You can, but you'll sound stupid.  Comparing the Ice Cream Man lyrically with fucking Children of the Grave or Lord of This 
[01:06:00]  World.  What's that?  Ice Cream Man and a remake.  Whatever it is.  I showed you how much I know about Van Halen.  I don't even know it's a remake.  It's a fun song, though.  Van Halen, we're a fun party band.  It's not a fun song, though.  I gave him a Dixie Cubs.  Really?  Where's the fun in that?  Explain to me how much fun we're having.  It's a fun song.  It's not fun.  I think it's kind of fun.  It really isn't.  I think it's kind of fun.  Songs are never fun.  I think...  You want to hear a song that's fun?  I do.  Oh, my God.  Do you have my song that is... 
[01:06:30]  The songs that actually have...  It's all about fun?  They have the word fun in them.  They sure do.  Which means...  Yeah!  Wait for the fun part, Jimmy.  I think you owe us an apology, Jimmy. 
[01:07:00]  We just played a fun song.  Yeah, I was talking more about metal.  I stand corrected.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  What's some of those other fun songs?  How about Dance the Night Away?  Is that a fun one, too?  Would that be fun?  Would you dance in a circle?  Would you dance around Liz Taylor on her fucking...  On her Cleopatra throne?  I know what.  They danced around Ozzy Osbourne at Drunk Bloop. 
[01:07:30]  I'm 42 years old.  I'm not going to get into Rock Wars with you.  Ozzy is still on tour.  You already are.  You're in the middle of a rock war.  You know that.  But I'm really not.  You're in a rock war.  You can't...  It's silly to say these things.  Ozzy's on tour about that.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ozzy's was there before and after David the Roth.  Let me try to control the situation.  Because I see what Jimmy's doing.  I see what this guy's doing.  So let's do this.  Jimmy's picking out Van Halen songs that are a little rough to defend.  Every little we're playing.  All right.  No.  But this guy.  Give me three Van Halen songs that make your point. 
[01:08:00]  And then we go to Jimmy with his three Sabbath songs that make his point.  And then we can settle this rock war.  Go, sir.  Okay.  I'll go with Van Halen, Hot The Teacher.  Oof.  Okay.  What else?  Oh, boy.  You just lost.  Okay.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't like Hot The Teacher.  No, no.  Go ahead.  I was just thinking.  Go ahead.  I would have went with something from the first album myself.  But go ahead.  Running.  Hot The Teacher was a huge hit.  I know.  But it's poppy. 
[01:08:30]  It's poppy.  All right.  What's your third song, Ken?  Should I go with Sammy Higgory or should I go with Dave Lee Royce?  Whatever your instinct says to you.  Yeah.  Whatever you want, bro.  I'm going to stick with Ozzy and not go into D.O., but.  I'm going to go with an obscure song that is really good.  One Foot Out the Door.  One Foot Out the Door?  It's actually Sunday afternoon in the park and it goes into One Foot Out the Door.  Okay.  Jimmy?  It's a very obscure song, but it proves nothing.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what Jimmy does.  Three Black Sabbath songs.  Okay.  I'm not going to go with any hits.  Ones that I like.  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  Really?  No.  Oh, this is a brave move.  A National Acrobat.  Okay.  Under the Sun.  And what will the third one be?  I'm trying to think of songs I really like.  Go with someone that can sing.  Go with Mob Rules.  That's D.O., you silly goose, but you knew that already.  I know I got it, Josh.  Relax.  He said he wasn't going to go there.  Yeah, I did say I wasn't going to go with D.O.  Jimmy said he wasn't going to go there.  I'm trying to think of something maybe off of a sabotage.  We could go Hall in the Sky or Symptom of the Universe. 
[01:09:30]  Let's go Symptom of the Universe.  Oh, okay.  Hall in the Sky was one of my favorites.  Oh, good.  That's why I avoided it.  Someone said that Sabbath songs sound like Lord of the Rings.  Sounds like Lord of the Rings.  It's a very different.  Who's going to settle this?  Because the three songs Jimmy picked, I only know the one because you come out to...  I used to years ago.  Yeah, not anymore.  It's been a while, but you used to come out to that song.  That's the only one I know.  So now I'm out.  Do you know these songs?  Not really, no.  No.  I wasn't a big Sabbath fan. 
[01:10:00]  I liked Ozzy, especially through the 80s.  I thought Ozzy was fun and kind of, you know, cool.  Play Symptom of the Universe.  You got to have a right sabotage.  What do you mean Ozzy was fun?  It was fun.  Give me a fun Ozzy song.  September the Universe, a fun...  This is a fun song.  This is fun.  This is fun.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I like this.  Phenomenal.  I like this.  I could get into this. 
[01:10:30]  So good.  It's not ice cream, man, but...  Wow.  Drums are insane.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Take me through the centuries to supersonic years.  The defying enemy is drowning in his tears. 
[01:11:00]  All I have to give you is a love to dance.  It never dies.  The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I could get into that.  Craziness.  I like that.  That's the devil's music. 
[01:11:30]  That's the devil's music.  All right, Ken.  I mean, music is what it is.  Everyone has their favorites.  What can I tell you?  It's like talking sports.  Everyone has an opinion.  Or politics.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's true.  Sorry.  No, it's true.  You're not changing anyone's mind.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Can you play that Megadeth Paranoid so that Jimmy can be enlightened?  I already have it.  I just don't remember it.  I have that version.  You know what?  We'll go to break with that.  If it's that damn good, I'm going to take your word on that.  Finish off our musical break.  I'm still waiting for a fun song from Ozzy. 
[01:12:00]  Because I got the next fun song.  If we're all about fun songs.  How about No More Tears?  That's a fun song?  I never loved that one.  No.  Never loved that one.  Really?  Not my favorite Ozzy song.  I actually like Paranoid.  That's probably my favorite Ozzy song.  That was filler for the album.  I like it, too.  That was filler?  It was filler.  It was literally something that they threw in.  The album was supposed to be called War Pigs.  Crazy Train is fun.  Crazy Train is a fun song.  You're on a train.  It's crazy.  Yeah, fair enough.  Right?  A little crazy.  It's crazy.  It's a train.  Trains are fun. 
[01:12:30]  War Pigs is an awesome song.  Tremendous.  War Pigs is not really fun, though.  I don't go too deep with that.  Generals are gathering in their masses.  Yeah.  Just like witches at black masses.  Not too much fun there.  It doesn't go, you know, generals gathered in their masses.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Yes.  Just like witches at black masses.  Front seat, back seat.  They're singing as Ozzy.  Death and hatred to mankind.  Gotta get my bowl.  My cereal. 
[01:13:00]  How do you know that song if you don't like Sabbath that much?  I used to sing that one.  Oh, in...  That's a big one, too.  Yeah, yeah.  For the bands.  That's a popular number.  I like Sweet Leaf, too, man.  It's a popular ditty.  Yeah, Sweet Leaf was good.  Yeah.  I like Sweet Leaf.  I got the next fun song.  I never liked the beginning.  That coughing always annoyed me.  Yeah, what was that about?  Because he coughed at smoking pot.  Yeah, he's smoking pot and he's coughing.  It's just the opening to the album.  But we all figured that out.  But it was like nails on a chalkboard to me.  I couldn't deal with that part of it.  Jimmy says there's no fun songs out there. 
[01:13:30]  I got the next fun song for everybody.  Yeah?  Yeah, and you can pick your favorite fun song for the opening.  Well, you know what mine is.  Well, we're not going to do the obvious one.  House next door to me.  That's a very sad song.  Here's the next fun song that we're featuring today.  It's Fun Song Friday.  Fun song.  You have to like this one.  Ow, something's in my asshole. 
[01:14:00]  Ow!  It just jumps into your ass.  Who's that big band from Brooklyn?  Heavy band from Brooklyn.  They get a cover of Paranoid.  It was really slow, really finished with my woman, because she was really slow.  It was great.  Not, uh, oh, we used to play it.  Dude, you know them.  Black, black, black.  Yeah, typo.  Typo negative.  There you go.  This is typo.  I think, wait.  That's just how you sang it. 
[01:14:30]  It sounds like typo negative.  Were they Brooklyn?  I don't know.  I don't know the Brooklyn part, but.  I don't know about that, but they were definitely slow, and it sounds like.  We're getting a yes.  And they did do, uh, they did cover that song.  That version is fantastic.  Can we hear that?  I don't know if people will like it, but it's.  This is our, this is just.  This is a totally unique take on it.  It's over seven minutes. 
[01:15:00]  Holy shit.  The original was, what, three and a half, maybe?  Wow.  The original was a fast, quick song.  Can you just play the first, uh, couple of songs?  Oh, yeah.  Take it.  Take a listen.  Number one.  We're here.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Finished with my one. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, it's very James Gummish.  Yeah, it's James Gumm.  I love Sabbath covers.  I love them. 
[01:16:00]  Wow, what a great voice, man.  Yeah.  Just a weird version.  I just don't know this man that well.  Are you a great big fat person?  Are you about a size 14?  Would you fuck me and fuck me hard?  Oh, I want to make a vest with tits out of it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:16:30]  It's a happy song?  Fun, fun, fun, fun?  I'd love to hear that right now.  It's a toe tapper.  Oh, really?  Jesus.  You know, it's a fun song?  Come on.  Fucking, I got a brand new pair of roller skates by Melanie. 
[01:17:00]  You're the one that said there's no fun song.  I'm on metal, I guess I should have said.  Can we play another fun song?  Can we play Jimmy's fun song?  Melanie.  That is a good one.  Man, are you going to pick a fun song or what?  Let me think of a real fun song.  Yeah, no, I got one.  You got one?  Instantly, yeah.  All right, let's do Jimmy's first.  So this is Jimmy's fun song for this Friday.  He's probably spelling Melanie wrong.  He's just not on the same page.  Oh, my God.  M-E-L-A-N-Y.  The one day we really need him to really fucking rock that board in there. 
[01:17:30]  See, now we're just sitting here waiting.  I'll get him.  How hard is to find Melanie's camera?  Fucking Anthony.  You're fucking.  You're a queer.  I just wanted to start.  I don't want to show E-Rock that when not appropriate.  What is he doing?  He's still trying to find yours.  You can't find M-E-L-A-N-I.  Melanie.  He's spelling melody.  I would bet a hundred dollars.  Melody or fucking.  Melanie.  Oh. 
[01:18:00]  What, E-Rock?  I'm spelling M-E-L-A-N-I-E.  Oh, this is it.  Where was it?  He was spelling B-O-L-A-N-E.  I put the roller skates in the time.  Of course you did.  Why wouldn't you?  Oh.  Oh.  Tell me this isn't fun.  I'll spit in your eye.  I rode my bicycle past your window last night.  This will always remind me of fucking Roller Girl in Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  They were playing this when she was fucking skating, looking hotter than fuck. 
[01:18:30]  The music was perfect in fucking Boogie Nights, man.  Amazing.  That's an underrated movie.  Yes, it's phenomenal.  Especially when it came out.  I think it holds a great place now more than it did when it first came out.  Yeah.  Dude, I expected Don Cheadle to die in that donut shop, but he didn't.  I was so happy he didn't.  He didn't.  He wound up getting his stereo place.  Yeah.  There you go.  This is a happy song.  It's a great movie.  There's Jimmy's fun song. 
[01:19:00]  These songs depressed me, too, from the 60s.  Why?  More innocent time?  Do you miss that?  Yeah, this and To Start With Love, because you know that their youth is gone.  These songs have a weird effect on me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To Start With Love was a very...  It's a great song by Lulu, but it's fucking weird.  Do I know that one?  To Start With Love?  Yeah.  It's kind of sad.  That's not a happy song.  That's a sad one.  It's sad.  Just to get the info out there, we lost Peter Steele, by the way, right?  Who?  The type of negative guy. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, he did die.  Right, right, right.  Yes.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, this is...  I did forget about that.  This is very sad.  This was the title track to the movie.  It was a movie.  Oh, yeah.  And Sir was...  What's his name?  Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier!  Wow.  Sidney Poitatete!  That fine African-American actor, Sidney Poitatatete!  And Lulu's singing, and...  This makes me feel like I used to live back then. 
[01:20:00]  It's time to leave school and go to work and go to Vietnam.  This is a weird vibe to her.  Oh.  I remember hearing this when it first came out, and...  You were in high school.  I was...  Actually, I was going to say I was into my 20s.  Jesus.  You were committing statutory rape when this song came out.  But they wrote it to you.  And here she is.  She's describing how she feels about the teacher.  If you wanted the sky, I would ride across the sky and let her... 
[01:20:30]  So here's what I think when I hear this.  Bro, what the fuck is he doing?  He's going to be a faggot if he carries that fucking doll around with him.  Oh, Joey, shut the fuck up.  He's just a kid.  He wants to play with a toy.  A doll isn't a toy a boy should be playing with.  It's an action figure.  Shut the fuck up.  Who asked you?  And this is playing in the Rambler.  No seatbelts.  I'm flying around because he's mad.  Stepping on the brake in the gas like a madman.  He's hoping to knock... 
[01:21:00]  Shut up, bro, and pop another beer.  He's hoping to bang your head and it knocks the gay out of you.  Stop crying, you little faggot.  Don't call him a faggot, Joey.  Shut up, cunt.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This was my drive.  And this song's playing in the background.  No wonder I remember.  All this stuff when these songs play.  That's what I remember.  I don't know.  You're lost, Joey.  I'm not lost.  Fuck you.  What's the matter?  Does your girlfriend live around here, Joey?  Oh, fuck you.  Fuck you, Ro. 
[01:21:30]  I know that bitch you're fucking in Connecticut  when you're supposed to be unloading vending machine money.  Shut the fuck up.  You're going to get divorced.  Shut up.  You fucking faggot.  I don't even know what that means.  Give me my action figure.  It's a doll and you're not playing with it.  No son of mine is going to be a cocksucker.  Joey, stop using that language.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:00]  Did he throw your action figure out the window?  Yes, he cranked.  I saw his elbow just moving as he got to roll the window down.  The old school fucking crank.  And then he just took my action figure and threw it out the window  because it was a fag-making doll.  Would he not smoke in the car because you're...  Oh, my God.  We got tarry tins.  Fucking tarry tins lighting up all over the place.  More secondhand smoke in my system than anybody ever.  Ever.  Holy shit. 
[01:22:30]  I'd be better off sticking my head in the steam  coming out of the fucking reactors in Japan.  But your dad might be on to something  because you just picked out your fun song  and it doesn't help your kickstart.  Oh, well, yeah.  But this is fun.  You want to hear his fun song?  Play my fun song, E-Rock.  His dad might have been on to something.  I like this one.  Yes, it's true.  And you are one.  It's not shitting.  It loves this song. 
[01:23:00]  What the fuck are you playing?  Dance it, Queen, you faggot!  Oh, Joey, he likes the song.  Shut up, bitch!  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  Woo!  Great harmonies in ABBA, right?  It's the super group from Sweden or something, right?  Weren't they?  The super group from Sweden.  And now, another song. 
[01:23:30]  Friday night and the lights are low.  Wait.  Uh, uh.  Okay, faggot!  What's next?  I hate you.  You know, it's like Louisiana.  You got no complaints. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, Lord!  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Almost forcÃ©ment, she's at Kentucky or something, right?  Only seventeen!  You're the mighty!  Dancing queen!  Be a beat from the tea! 
[01:24:30]  Thatc, I'm ready!  You can dance!  You can drop!  Fill in the sky of your own!  Ooh!  Oh!  Extreme girl!  French and sing!  I roll!  Toot-a-dee, toot-a-dee-doo.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fuck.  Holy shit, I think I hyperventilated playing the toot-a-dee horn. 
[01:25:00]  You almost passed out, you all right?  I'm almost passing out.  You all right?  I'm dizzy.  What a cheap buzz.  Well.  Damn.  Fuck.  You know what?  Yeah.  I got to be honest with you.  This guy, Anthony, in Hamilton, Ontario, is on to something.  Another fun song.  All right, Hamilton.  Because we've officially deemed this fun song Friday.  Fun song Friday.  We're bringing back themes, ladies and gentlemen.  And it's because of...  Oh, God, please no.  Holy shit, I hated our theme phase. 
[01:25:30]  They were horrible.  That was almost the end of the O&A show.  What do you mean almost?  We got kicked off, remember?  Yeah.  What about Titty Mountain Highway?  Is that a fun song?  I think it's a fun song.  I don't know if Titty Mountain Highway is a fun song.  I think it's a fun song, man.  I think it's too profound to be fun.  You really think.  It's thought-provoking.  You would think E-Rock would read the instant feedback to see where we might be going at  this point.  What?  Because now he's studying the screens again.  Oh, jeez.  And watch the delay.  He's looking at...  Taking the energy right out of the room.  You know what it is?  He looks at the screen like he looks at a McDonald's drive-thru menu. 
[01:26:00]  He's just like, it's all so good.  I'm going to break things down for you.  Yeah.  Like, we've been doing this show a long time.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  And you look at the phones or the instant feedback, you can maybe get a feel for where  we might go.  Where we might be going.  So then you would think that maybe he would be a little more aware.  There is a certain...  But see, right now we're doing filler because he's still trying to find the fucking...  What are you looking for?  Titty Mountain Highway.  Oh!  There is a certain simpatico that we need here that...  I don't know that word.  That's too big.  I don't know.  It's some Spanish word.  Oh, okay. 
[01:26:30]  Simpatico.  It means like a cohesiveness.  Yeah.  Marching in the same beach.  Yes.  And after so many years, you think...  You instinctively kind of pick up on where people are going.  You kind of know.  A little bit.  Yeah.  It's like a chemistry kind of a thing.  And you're...  We're like water.  And you're oil.  Yeah.  You got T-Mountain Highway?  You find it?  This is another fun song.  You just saved your ass again.  Fun song Friday.  Starring Bob Kelly.  On the T-Mountain Highway. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  T-Mountain Highway.  Riding along.  T-Mountain Highway.  What is he doing?  Singing my soul.  Jimmy's disgusted.  What the fuck are you guys doing?  I'm gone.  Here in the front.  I only had the way that we ain't gonna stop on the T-Mountain Highway. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Rebecca Black with the song off.  Oh, shit.  Because he's talking about us all in the car and shit.  In the car.  Front seat, back seat.  Right.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You got it?  Yeah.  Got the AC-DC vocals down a little bit.  Now, Travis going bald.  Steve's going bald.  Yeah, I'm going to get him on my way. 
[01:28:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get him on my way.  Haunting.  We never made it this far into the song.  No.  I didn't know there was a second verse.  Get him on my way.  Wow.  Damn.  I think you need a third verse to that song.  I actually have another.  Could I have those papers, the stack of papers over there so I can write this down?  You have another fun song?  I have a fun song.  That's crazy.  And I really mean it.  No, I know.  Yeah.  We're supposed to be picking real fun songs.  Oh, I got a fun song, too. 
[01:28:30]  You do?  Can you play it real quick?  The Bay City Rollers.  Oh, my God.  Saturday night.  Whoa.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Tomorrow.  Tonight is the Friday song.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Tomorrow is the Saturday song.  No, I actually like the Bay City Rollers growing up, too.  Night.  Or at least this dumb song.  Night.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  They would be on the cover of Tiger Beat magazine.  But this is Saturday.  Saturday.  It was always the Bay City Rollers versus Kiss.  Oh, really?  In Teen Beat and Tiger Beat.  I guess we know who won that.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Of Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Who doesn't like this song?  I suggest you just get out of the fucking country.  This is a good song to dig your own fingernails into your ass cheeks and rip them open for  another job.  On a Saturday night.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Saturday night.  Yeah.  Saturday night.  It's a good song to have your hemorrhage fucking split open to.  Yeah.  It's Fun Song Friday.  It sure is.  I like that.  Someone wants, uh, well, why don't you just...  Yeah.  Why the election?  Jesus Christ.  Your rock is just getting crucified today.  Well, he's not paying attention.  What does this mean?  That means bring it down.  Please, just bring it down.  Bring it down.  What do you think?  You were blessing him when you put it down? 
[01:30:00]  I don't know what's going on.  He's trying.  I had...  Yeah.  He's panicking in there.  He is.  He doesn't know what to do.  I know.  He's like, he's in a gym.  We've decided to go...  Sorry.  We've decided to go high energy and we need you today, you know.  Yeah.  On the ball.  On the ball.  People want Jay Giles because they had some fun songs.  Yeah.  They went with Freeze Frame.  I'd go with Centerfold.  Centerfold?  That's my opinion on that.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I would go Centerfold over Freeze Frame.  The high school girl he knew and now she's fucking naked. 
[01:30:30]  Sweaters and stuff.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Yeah.  This is a fun song.  It's clapping at the beginning.  You know a song that's going to be fun when it's like this.  Any song where you can clap along?  Yeah.  Centerfold.  This isn't as fun, though.  Does she...  Oh, this was huge.  No, no, but it's about a girl he knows in high school who's now showing her cunt to a camera.  She's not doing well.  She was dancing, right? 
[01:31:00]  Or no, in a Playboy or something.  Playboy.  She's a staple in her.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's jerking off to a men's magazine and she's in it.  She's in blacks and blondes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Angel is there for my lover.  Okay.  All right, all right.  Now, play one of my happy favorite songs.  Is this real?  I used to love this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we don't want to fool around. 
[01:31:30]  This one's great.  It's already gay enough.  Just be real with this.  This is one of my favorite songs ever.  Fun song?  Yeah.  It's very fun.  It's about fucking Catholic girls.  I don't know this one either. 
[01:32:00]  Catholic girls.  See?  I like that.  That's great.  I know he talks about getting blowjobs and stuff.  Really?  Fucking Catholic girls.  Yeah, with their little Catholic schoolgirl.  He has Jewish princess, too.  Yes, yes.  Oh, he was all around, you know.  Bobby Brown, I think, is his best song. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah?  I liked everything off of Joe's Garage.  I like preferred Shake Your Booty.  Remember that one?  Sheik Your Booty.  Frank Zappo.  Was it called Sheik?  Yes, he was dressed as a Sheik.  No, I know, but that was pronounced Sheik.  Frank Zappo.  Well, it could have.  Why would it be Sheik Your Booty instead of Shake Your Booty?  It was...  Well, because it was...  Like, it was a Sheik.  Like a...  But they do pronounce it Sheik.  Yeah, so Shake Your Booty was a dance thing.  But it was...  But it was a Sheik.  How was that pronounced?  Sheik or Shake?  Shake.  Like Sheik Omar. 
[01:33:00]  But they also call them Sheiks.  They do.  But the pronunciation for that...  He wouldn't have named it Your Booty if he was going to call it the Real Sheik.  I never thought of it that way, James.  Shake Your Booty.  I think he sang it sort of weird, though, is the problem, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  He was a genius, unless it came to...  Going for...  Going his asshole probe.  He really didn't like a finger in his tushy.  Take that finger now, man.  I'll save you some heartache later.  Yeah.  Look at that shit.  Fucking Broken Hearts are for Assholes. 
[01:33:30]  It's a great fucking tune.  I really liked Frank Zappo.  Oh, people say...  Look at that.  Janine says, oh, my favorite wrestler is the Iron Shake gem.  Comment?  Because she's right.  It is pronounced Sheik.  However, Shake is also a proper pronunciation.  I know.  So Janine...  Janine's just being a shithead.  I hope Janine's ovaries get caught in a lawnmower.  Oh, shit!  That would have to be a horrible thing that would have to happen. 
[01:34:00]  A terrible gardening accident, I think, as her legs were akimbo.  She'd have to fall with her legs wide open while somebody was cutting the grass.  Yes.  And for the blades to get in there and take her ovaries without really destroying everything else would be quite a difficult time.  I want to see the vagina get chewed up, too.  Oh, okay.  Well, then that's easy.  We'll go to break with another fun song for this fun song Friday.  Yeah.  AJ and Philly picked this one. 
[01:34:30]  AJ and Philly.  You know this one.  Okay.  This is another fun song for everybody.  Fun song.  And we might do some real radio after this break.  We're not really sure yet.  Oh, no.  It's Friday.  We have a lot of fun songs to get to.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  What?  We'll go to break with this one, and then we do have some things.  Nancy Grace.  Thanks.  A lady with some...  Who is that bitch?  She had a flub on the local news.  Did she say fuck?  Yes.  She meant to say lottery.  She said cunt lips. 
[01:35:00]  And you got the black girl in the bikini that everyone's talking about.  Oh, shit.  Every time there's a ruckus these days and you go to a video, those black people love making a ruckus.  This is very impressive.  They call it, on some of the more racist websites, they call it TNB.  TNB.  TNB?  Yeah, that's what they preface it when they show the video.  It's called TNB.  I thought that was a new network.  TNB.  Well, it could be.  It could be.  Formerly called BET.  Jesus.  Let's play this to break.

[01:37:00]  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Another video for this with the kicking robot legs.  Mannequin pieces.  Listen, that song really is catchy.  It's just such an old man thing to say, why don't you behave? 
[01:37:30]  Falling for behave.  Tell them to behave.  Tell them to behave.  That's Drew Boogie, right?  Yeah, of course.  It's great.  That could really...  We should do something with that.  Make a video.  There's something there.  I'm telling you.  He does such a good fucking job with just how he's able to listen to that and think, ah,  I could make a song of that.  It's just a rant.  It's a talent.  One of my racist rants.  Drew Boogie is a talented motherfucker.  We were saying that that would be a really cool song.  But it would be so hard to sell with, you know, black on black crime, black on white crime. 
[01:38:00]  Tell them to fucking behave.  Bowling for behave.  Yeah, I'm sure the blacks will really dance to that one.  Well, let's find out.  Sam, could you give it to the guys next door, across the street?  Could you give them a copy of Bowling for Behave to Shade 45?  See if they like it.  I could drive it to the powers that be at Shade 45.  Or Smasher Trash.  Yeah, give it to Smasher Trash.  Or Smasher Trash, right.  We understand regular radio is not going to pick up on the song, but there's something  there in this viral world we live in. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  And it is uncensored over at Shade 45.  Yeah.  Give them a copy of what they say.  You should make a video.  Like all the fucking L.A. riots and Reginald Denny getting hit in the head.  But then your head just popping up like a funny thing.  Bowling for Behave.  That's a great idea.  It really is a great idea.  Tell them to Behave.  You have to make a video for that.  That fucking would do really well online.  Right, that was a walk.  That was a Christopher Walken flying video we played earlier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially if you have your bouncing head like Jimmy's talking.  I'm telling you, it would be a smash. 
[01:39:00]  The fucking wilding out and the fucking...  Oh, yeah, there's plenty of footage, believe me.  The Burger King fucking debacles that have been going on and Chuck E. Cheese.  But you can't pop in all angry.  You've got to be just happy.  No, no, happy head.  Dancing face.  I think it's happy, spinning head with just a mouth that moves like a puppet.  Yeah.  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  It's catchy as all hell.  Tell them to Behave.  Behave.  Behave.  Behave.  Well, we've got a story.  Oh, buddy.  I think that's why we played again.  Yes, Behave. 
[01:39:30]  We've got a black girl in a bikini and, well...  I don't know what that was about.  She got into a bit of a problem at a...  She's in a fine food restaurant.  At a Burger King.  A scuffle.  A little scuffle.  Ah, these things are popping up all over the place.  Anytime you see some kind of a ruckus.  You see the one with the spaghetti on the subway?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  You didn't see that one?  I heard about it, no.  There's some broad...  She's eating spaghetti on the subway and some woman was like, what are you doing?  You're eating fucking like an animal in the subway.  It's like, ah, motherfucker.  I know money.  She throws the spaghetti at the woman and shit. 
[01:40:00]  Well, why would the woman say anything about her eating spaghetti?  Because, like, it's fucking...  The subways are disgusting.  How long are you on a subway that you've got to eat your fucking food on there?  It stinks.  The food falls all over the place.  It's fucking...  It's a filthy, disgusting mess.  People don't eat nicely on the subway.  They leave shit all over the place.  It's fucking bologna slices on the floor.  What if it was one of those white girls, really white girls eating spaghetti?  Yeah, you wouldn't have a problem with that on the subway, right? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, no, not at all.  Okay, good.  I just wanted to make sure.  Well, let's just say this.  Play devil's advocate.  If you're eating spaghetti on a subway, you probably don't have great options of places  to enjoy your spaghetti.  Well, no, this looked like just some chick that wanted to fucking eat right then and there.  Fat chick?  It's another...  No, she wasn't that fat.  I think the chick that was telling her to not eat was fatter than she was.  Yeah.  But it's just the fact that you can't say anything to anybody without a reaction  that is just way over the top. 
[01:41:00]  Black people really have been a little crazy lately in food places.  There she is.  Look, she's eating a spaghetti.  I mean my spaghetti.  Animals eat on the train, she said.  She says animals eat on the train.  I have a feeling they're going to work out this problem. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, it's going to be nice.  They're just going to discuss it.  The audio is terrible.  There is a subway.  Yeah, but what kind of phone is this person that's filming this?  Is this off a pebble?  Oh, it's off a stolen.  She's still eating her spaghetti.  I guess we've got to fill in the blanks here.  And they're just having an exchange back and forth.  Can you pause this for a second?  Please.  Why would the woman across the way have a problem? 
[01:42:00]  Believe me, she should have opened her fucking yap anyway.  Because she probably smelled the spaghetti.  It probably smelled bad or some shit.  I really haven't seen this video.  I've heard about it a bunch of times.  I thought that the woman was real close to the woman eating the spaghetti.  Why is that fucking...  There's a whole aisle.  The black girl's sitting in one seat.  There's an aisle.  And then there's a bus.  It's an aisle, empty seat, because then she's sitting next to the window on the other side of the aisle.  Like, why would she have a problem with somebody eating spaghetti?  It probably stunk and fucking whatever.  She still should have shit.  You know what? 
[01:42:30]  Give this shit.  You know how bad the BO alone is on the subways?  I would welcome some nice spaghetti smell.  She's eating out of a styrofoam thing.  She's bought it on the go, and she's just eating it.  Yeah.  So what...  All right, go ahead.  Continue.  That was just the first observation.  That fat bitch should have shut the fuck up.  I think so, too.  Sorry, Ed.  She was white.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think she was in the wrong way.  And the black girl's eating her spaghetti.  She's just eating her spaghetti, the black girl.  I know.  All right, let's continue.  Oh, she puts her spaghetti down.  That can't be good.  Yeah.  And then she turns, and she's doing something with her spaghetti. 
[01:43:00]  She turned away from the fat white brother to continue eating her spaghetti.  Yeah.  She's shoving that in her face, though.  Maybe she's a girl on the go.  Is she just getting up?  Now the two girls, the black girls are getting up.  Oh, now they're in her face. 
[01:43:30]  She's holding up the spaghetti in a way that can't be good.  God, this guy doesn't know how to make a video, whoever filmed it.  The fat girl's standing her ground.  Now there's some pushing going on.  She's holding up the spaghetti. 
[01:44:00]  Now there's a push, and then all hell breaks loose.  Oh, now there's a pounding going on.  Now there's a problem.  Now there's pushing and shoving.  Oh, boy.  Someone's going to miss their stop.  The rodeo sucks, but now it's just...  Yeah, they just put...  But then Fat Girl shoved her first, I thought.  It looked like it.  Looked like it.  Now she threw a spaghetti at her. 
[01:44:30]  Her spaghetti is a spaghetti.  That's a reaction, yeah.  Yeah.  I got no problem with the black girls in this.  That was the fucking...  No, no, I know.  That fat girl was fucking being a big mouthy elephant.  Yeah.  And she got what she had coming to her.  And now she just sits down?  Well, I guess...  But it was in her face.  Yeah.  In her face.  That's about it for the video.  Yeah.  It's just...  All right.  I don't think...  All right.  The eating on the subway thing, though, you can't trust that people are going to be sanitary  and fucking nice with food because they're animals in fucking restaurants, never mind in 
[01:45:00]  a fucking subway.  It's just one of those...  Yeah, it's a subway etiquette thing.  You just don't...  You don't fucking eat.  Certain things, I think, are acceptable.  Like, if you have a snack or a bag of chips or something like that.  But something that's going to stink up a whole train car, like a spaghetti with sauce.  Spaghetti's going to stink up the whole thing and just fucking...  Have a little fucking common sense.  And, you know, sauce is flinging all over.  Like, when you eat it, it flexed sauce all over the place.  There's people who are shitting their pants sitting there on the subway, though.  There's a lot worse things than spaghetti.  And I wish you could get rid of them, too. 
[01:45:30]  I could care less if someone's eating spaghetti.  Yeah, that wouldn't drive me that nuts.  Especially as far away as she was.  Who cares?  Even if I didn't like the smell, which I would not, it would bother me.  You smell your, you smell B.O., you smell shit, you see rats.  Food gives a fuck.  But the rats are probably there because of the fucking food.  Yeah.  It's just people are slobs.  They are.  By nature.  And they feel that they have, that they're entitled to be slobs no matter where they are.  Right.  She wasn't being a slob.  No, she was just eating all of her...  Yeah, but you're saying that she's just eating spaghetti, but in reality, she's leaving 
[01:46:00]  flecks of sauce everywhere and, like, a little piece that missed her mouth.  And that's going to add to the trash and the rot.  I've seen chicken bones under the seats and shit.  I got no problem with eating spaghetti.  The smell would annoy me.  It would bother me.  But if someone's eating, I wouldn't give a fuck.  Honestly, I wouldn't.  There's a lot of things that would annoy me.  If someone smoked, that would annoy me.  But eating, I care.  Yeah, I'd be more pissed about smoking than something else.  And even if it's annoying and the girl was being rude, the fat girl, if there's two girls  over there and it's just you and you're a big fatso, because she wasn't bothering her. 
[01:46:30]  It wasn't like she was eating and standing over her and she had this...  She just fucking opened her big mouth for no reason and then got out of confrontation.  I just think you shouldn't be eating a big, disgusting, smelly thing in a crowded subway  car.  If there's, like, three other people on the car, whatever.  But that was a crowded subway.  You're probably right.  You shouldn't be.  But if someone does, is it worth the confrontation?  Because they really are just eating.  It's like, eh.  Especially that other fucking girl.  She was a fatso.  What kind of a fat girl is going to complain about where and when someone else is eating? 
[01:47:00]  How about the fact that her fucking fat body is taking up two seats?  Fat body?  Yeah.  What's your name, fat body?  That's why there was an empty seat there.  No one could fit into what's remaining of the empty seat.  I used to take a subway for a real long time.  I used to get so annoyed when people would start eating some stinky stain on the fucking  train.  It really does reek the whole thing out.  Because what you want to do, it's like, look, you're on the train.  No one wants to be on the train.  You have to take the train because you need to get home or you need to get to work.  So in that time that it takes you to do that, you just want to be relaxed as possible.  And what you don't want is to fucking have to smell someone else's shitty meal up your fucking 
[01:47:30]  nose the entire time home.  It's fucking annoying.  It is, but body odor is annoying.  Breath is annoying.  Some people can't do anything about that.  You have, as a human being, have an option to, you know what, hey, I'll not eat really  stinky fucking spaghetti and meatballs on the train today.  You do.  But again, when someone stinks up the car because they shit their pants, I'm not worried about  their options.  I'm just thinking the car smells like shit.  It smells like piss.  And spaghetti never smells bad.  I mean, if it was Indian food, then I would understand.  And like I said, people can't be trusted. 
[01:48:00]  They can't be trusted to fucking not make a mess of fucking things.  It's just, uh...  It's not right.  Well...  That's what I'm saying.  We'll agree to disagree.  Yeah, that one I didn't have a problem with.  Personally.  Would it annoy me again?  Sure.  But if she stood over that girl and ate it, like while the girl was sitting there  and she was standing over her face a little bit eating it, then I would go, that's a fucking  invasive thing that should be called out.  I don't know.  New York subway is a little different from other situations, too, because a lot of those 
[01:48:30]  cars, you can't even leave.  So it's like if someone just starts eating some stinky shit, my first reaction would be  like, well, I'll just move to the next car because I don't want to fucking deal with  it.  But a lot of cars, it's locked and you can't.  You're just trapped.  And you're just fucking trapped.  But is it really going to ruin your day?  Well, I shouldn't have to deal with your shitty food.  I don't want to fucking smell it.  I pay my money to get on the subway just like you do.  I don't fucking throw my shit in everybody else's face.  Just take the 10 minutes.  Don't eat.  Don't shove food into your face for 15 minutes on the fucking subway.  And then when you're out, find a spot and eat it.  How hard is that?  It's not that bad. 
[01:49:00]  I still...  Slobs.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I don't even...  I can't even disagree with that.  It's just...  I'm not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to do it.  It's just have a little common sense, you know, where you decide, where and when you  decide to do that.  But the fat girl deserved what she got because the girl seriously...  You have to take into consideration that she was not sitting right next to her.  So she's probably not thinking I'm stinking up the whole thing.  She's thinking I'm hungry.  The answer is not violence, by the way.  The fat girl pushed her.  The fat girl pushed her. 
[01:49:30]  Well, how'd she push her when she fucking got right in her fucking face?  We were yelling at each other.  She got right in her fucking face.  She called her an animal.  Because that's the fucking thing you do.  Get right in the fucking face and repeat the same thing 800 times.  I didn't see exactly how she got in her face because the tape cut.  But you know what?  She's like, animals eat on the subway.  It's like she was being...  If you're going to say that to two people who aren't fucking with you, unless there's  something I didn't see, then you've got to expect a confrontation.  She probably should have kept the gap shut.  Of course.  But I don't know.  This propensity toward violence at restaurants and fucking... 
[01:50:00]  I've seen so many of these videos and it's just crazy.  Maybe that one isn't a good example.  But look, it's these Chuck E. Cheese ones and fucking the H&S department store one and  the fucking one with the chick dancing on the fucking table and throwing shit around.  It's just...  I don't know.  They're all good examples.  Exactly.  This one's just not...  Do you search this stuff out, Anthony?  No.  I don't really have...  It's on Drudge.  It's on Drudge every day. 
[01:50:30]  Every day there's a new video on Drudge.  Look at Drudge.  Black video of the day on Drudge.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  They really do.  Which one is today?  The black girl in the bikini?  Yeah.  I haven't seen this to be completely honest with you.  She said she had to wait 20 minutes for food, which I really do hate the employees, but  it was completely animalistic behavior.  An overreaction to the situation.  Situation.  Yeah, it was awful.  You want to play it over there?  You want me to play it over here?  Can you even hear it? 
[01:51:00]  Try it, but the audio's not good.  I watched it yesterday.  Oh, really?  The audio's bad.  Yeah, you're just hearing, like, fucking yelling and...  She's fucking...  She's throwing stuff around like crazy.  She's standing on a table, jumping up and down, just winging stuff at people.  This is where I just was, by the way.  It's amazing.  This is where I shot the Leto Spring Break piece in Panama City Beach.  Hold on a second.  Joe asks from, uh, where the fuck is Joe S from?  Boston.  He goes, what the fuck is it with this staff and spaghetti trauma?  Yeah.  Wow, spaghetti is one of those fucking, uh, hot buttons for you. 
[01:51:30]  All right, let's go to this here.  Kini bro and burnt king.  Yeah, he did.  She's throwing her food.  This is the best Spring Break ever.  Literally. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, shut up.  And there it goes.  She's throwing her, knocking things over.  Oh, she's in a bikini with a big fat ass.  Yeah.  She has a nice ass though.  How she is.  Throwing things.  Now she's standing up.  Oh my God.  She's on the counter.  Yeah.  Standing on the counter and throwing things.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  She's really misbehaving.  Tell her to behave.  Hey.  Holy shit.  It's just animal behavior.  That is hysterical.  You never want your ass kicked by a girl in a bikini.  Wow.  They said no one, there was no injuries.  It was just, now look at all the shit she's throwing her.  Behaving like a fucking animal.  Look at her.  I've seen things like this before.  I can't remember where.  But I have seen behavior like this before. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It slips my mind.  You know what sucks?  You're already at a shitty job.  Fucking that burger king and now you gotta deal with this on top of it.  Now you gotta clean that up.  You know what's great with all these videos?  They always end with the guy that's recording it.  Spinning the camera around to himself and going, oh shit, I got on YouTube.  I got my video.  Oh, by the way.  We're all looking for our video.  Yeah.  The video that was the black cop fucking beating the shit out of the, slamming the white guy 
[01:53:30]  and that white girl face first into the fucking, he's on like administrative leave.  Did you see that one?  Oh, really?  I didn't see that one.  Yeah.  It was in Savannah.  Look for Savannah, Georgia, black cop.  Savannah, Georgia.  It was St. Paddy's Day.  The guy.  Hamburg.  The guy and his, the two white people were arguing with the black girls in the truck.  You couldn't see who was in the truck.  Uh-huh.  And the white guy started punching the truck like he was a big guy and his chick was kind  of scuffling with the girls and the cops come over and they, uh, they were rough with  the guy.  That might be it. 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  All right.  But the cop was way out of fucking line.  Yeah.  But it's not all over the news because it was a black cop on white.  Oh, right.  Right.  It was the way he treated the girl that I had the main problem.  Really?  Yeah.  The way he treated the guy, he hit him with the nightstick a few times, but the way he treats  the girl is fucking horrible.  You can fast forward.  They're just arguing.  A little argument going on.  Yeah.  And the guy starts punching the truck and then the cops show up.  Uh-huh.  And it's all black people filming it.  Another Michael J. Fox fucking video. 
[01:54:30]  Another horrible.  Yeah.  Jesus.  People don't know how to use their fucking cameras when it matters.  Right now there's a parked truck and the front and back door are open.  The white guy is watching his girlfriend lean in and kind of scuffle with people inside  the truck.  Why would, why would this white chick be doing this?  I don't know what happened.  This is crazy.  She's going to get her ass handed to her.  Oh, wow.  She's throwing some fists.  Yeah.  It's a good fight going on.  It's a good fight going on.  It's a good fight going on.  It's a good fight going on.  It's a good fight going on.  It's a good fight going on.  Yeah.  And the guy yells.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  Is that the cop?  I don't know.  The guy yells, you fat fucking cunt.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no, she didn't.  All right, they're still arguing.  Look at this.  He just dents the truck with his fist.  Oh, yeah, he's punching the door.  Denting the truck.  He dented the truck with his fist.  Wow, these are some crazy people.  And here's how the cops.  The cop comes over.  Wow, big black cop.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  See, the guy complies, he gets down.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  He's hit him with the nightstick.  Yeah, he's on the ground.  Stepping on her.  No, he's just keeping...  She walks over.  Shit.  He's beating the fucking chick with the nightstick.  Yeah, beat her with the nightstick.  Wow.  Why would she keep going?  She's done.  She's probably drunk.  Did he spray her?  Damn.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, he sprayed her.  That's why she's grabbing her eyes.  Mased her.  Okay.  It's pretty hot.  She's got a mace on her and blood on her arm.  Put your hands on her and blood on her arm. 
[01:56:00]  Uh-huh.  And this cop has been suspended.  Oh, yeah?  The girl right now is by the camera.  She's got mace.  Obviously, I didn't know it was mace.  Good call.  Mace in her eyes.  Mars.  Of course, Mars recognized that immediately.  Yeah.  She's walking away from the scene.  She's walking away.  Yeah.  And the camera's following her.  And the cop runs up to grab her.  But look at how he brings her back.  He grabs her by the back of her jeans.  Oh, shit.  Drags her backwards.  What the fuck is that about?  He's dragging her backwards.  And then he puts her on the ground.  Oh. 
[01:56:30]  He face-planted her.  Wow.  That's going to be more.  Oh, God.  She ain't moving now.  This is like Bizarro World.  But the guys around are all fucking on the cop about it.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Where was this?  Savannah, Georgia.  Yeah, Georgia.  That's a female, man.  That's a female, man.  But you know what I mean?  All the black guys filming it are fucking on the side of the couple.  Well, they're never going to side with the cops no matter what.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I'm like, wow, black people really don't like the cops. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Damn, he face-planted her right into the fucking pavement.  And again, Savannah took action against the cop.  Yeah.  But the mainstream media is not showing this all over the place.  No, why would they?  Why would they?  Yeah.  Wow.  The guy got in trouble, but it's like, why isn't this on the news?  That's the only point I have.  That should be on the news.  Yeah.  Great video to check out.  Yeah.  So.  Damn.  Damn. 
[01:57:30]  That's some fucked up repugnant shit.  Hell yeah, man.  I think black people are going to be on the news.  I think black people don't like black cops just as much as they don't like white cops.  Yeah, I think they think of them as like Uncle Toms and shit.  Well, I think they're also, a lot of the black cops are really rough when they go back into  the neighborhoods, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They're pretty brutal.  A lot of times they're worse than the white cops.  I think they, it's something like having to prove themselves or something.  Maybe, yeah.  Yeah.  Like they're not part of that scene.  Could somebody black call and give us information?  We need the skinny quickly.  We need the skinny quickly. 
[01:58:00]  Clear the phones.  Let's get a black listener on the goddamn line.  Clear the phones.  Yeah, we don't have any blacks calling.  We need the black people's advice here.  We have fucking Bill from Waterford.  Yeah, I know.  Fucking, you know, Cliff from Sudbury.  We, uh, it was a fun song Friday.  What happened?  That was fun.  That was kind of fun?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She put her fucking face in the pavement.  Just need a fun song in the background.  Yeah.  We would have been okay with that.  Yeah.  Bowling for behave.  Yeah.  Eat the pavement, bitch.  Yeah.  Wow.  Drag her by the belt. 
[01:58:30]  Did he make her do a face plant?  Did he not?  Raise her in the face.  Did he knock her out?  Because she didn't move after she hit the pavement.  I don't know.  It was on the pavement.  It was totally unnecessary.  She did not move.  All right.  We got, uh, Nancy from, uh, Sparkle Markets.  Hmm?  Yeah.  This is a good little clip.  What the hell is that?  It'll bring back the funk.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Hope you're getting a little turned on, aren't you?  I don't really understand what that means at all.  I think, uh, at the, um, girl being maced and pulled back by the belt and thrown on 
[01:59:00]  the ground.  That turned me on.  I don't know.  It didn't seem to, but.  I didn't know that was maced.  Omar's point.  That's what, that explains why she's covering her face.  Yeah.  Tell her to behave.  Bill in Indiana.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  And say hi to Deanna for us.  Bill.  That's kind of chipped him.  What's up, Bill?  Chipped him.  He's in Deanna.  Yes?  You talking to me?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  I'm just wondering how Hope would feel if that chick was sitting on the subway eating  grapes and making too much noise with that.  Would that piss him off?  I'm, I'm.  I'll linger.  Yeah, that's a good one, but I'm telling you right now.  Oh, that is a real good one.  It just really hit me.  Honestly, the food thing on the subway is not, not something that would bother me.  Yeah.  The smell would annoy me though, but I, there's, you got to pick your battles and it's like  some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, 
[02:00:00]  some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some,  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Just private jokes going on.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous, but I couldn't contain myself.  It went into the direction you think it did.  Whatever you're thinking, you're probably spot on.  Yeah, all right.  All right, there you go.  Let's go to John in Georgia.  John.  Hey, I was just wondering if Ant happened to hear about the colored gentleman in San Antonio  that went to the drive-thru at a Taco Bell and found out...  Hey, John, why didn't you say nigger? 
[02:00:30]  Because you really wanted to.  Wow.  I just need to say that.  Yeah, he wanted to jump in.  Just be brave enough to say it.  Be a racist.  Jesus.  We're trying to keep things light and fun here.  Go ahead, John.  He went to the drive-thru, found out the burrito went up 50 cents, and it was with a standoff  with a SWAT team in a hotel room.  Wasn't that a Mexican guy?  No, it was a black guy.  Oh, it was?  I thought it was a Mexican guy.  I looked at Mars when I was like...  A Mexican guy?  Here's what black people could probably work on as a group.  But how about handling things in the fast food restaurants with a bit more diplomacy? 
[02:01:00]  A little civility, a little diplomacy.  I've felt the same anger in fast food restaurants.  But how about you have some level between my fries are cold to throwing the order at their  face.  How about there's one step in there between...  In between.  It did one step.  It could be, could I see the manager?  How about...  Right.  Instead of...  Before you pick up the fryer and hit the guy, how about you say, could I see the manager, 
[02:01:30]  please?  Try to talk it out first.  Yeah.  And then if things go awry, do whatever you want.  Well, if the fries are no good, how about you say, look, miss, my fries are cold.  I'd like more.  Yeah.  Instead of, the fries are cold, bitch.  Bitch.  That immediately puts you on a bad foot.  What are you going to do about my cold fries, bitch?  Yeah.  And then you throw them back through the drive-thru window.  Nobody is going to go, oh, let me help this customer.  Oh, excuse me.  Well, we'll fix that right for you.  Here's the difference. 
[02:02:00]  Black people throw shit at the manager.  White people call 911 and get arrested at the fucking drive-thru.  That's what white people do.  We got Tommy in Jacksonville.  He's a black guy, which is important for the discussion.  Yes, it is.  Hi, Tom.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  Are you an uncle?  Oh.  Now, wait.  That's funny.  I've never heard that before.  That's why I added the ba-na-ba-ba-na-ba.  Acknowledging that it's beyond hacking.  What do you got, Tommy?  Yeah.  Hey, man. 
[02:02:30]  Look.  I'm a guy.  I have two, three small children.  The youngest.  Of course.  One.  And the...  Oh, shit.  What?  And...  Look, I've been affiliated with city government for most of my life.  And I can tell you...  And that's...  It's on welfare.  Of course.  Why is everybody giving Tom a hard time?  I know.  He's just trying to help us and explain.  I'm just trying to give you my perspective.  Go ahead, Tom.  Sorry.  All right.  Black cops, when they go into these neighborhoods, they don't go in there because they don't 
[02:03:00]  belong to that scene.  They're tired themselves.  I mean, they've done...  They've done...  They've improved their lives to a point to where, okay, why am I going back here and  having to deal with this bullshit on a constant basis when I go over to the white side and  it's just...  It's like...  It's like Oz.  Everything is so beautiful over here and we don't have nearly the trouble.  Why are you guys acting like assholes?  And it pisses them off.  I can tell you they hate it and they're the different way of dealing with these guys because 
[02:03:30]  they are pissed at dealing with it constantly, constantly, constantly.  Are the black guys...  I remember there was a scene in Boys in the Hood where I think Cuba Gooding gets pulled  over or whatever and there's the white cop and the black cop and the fucking black cop  is much more brutal and angry than the white cop.  It's like, ah, let's just go, get the fuck, whatever.  Yeah.  But the black cop is brutal.  But I've heard they're rougher than the white cops a lot of times.  When you have to explain to your seven-year-old kid why the fuck this shit constantly is 
[02:04:00]  happening and you're trying to keep your kids out of gangs and then you see...  You know, potentially, you know, just for being in that area.  You know, I called a while back and I said, you know, I'm a black guy and I don't live  in the ghetto.  I live in the suburbs.  I grew up kind of in the ghetto, you know, kind of in between.  And the first thing I could do when I got of age is to get out.  It doesn't matter how.  Why stay there?  Why continue with this false bravado? 
[02:04:30]  You know, this is my shit.  This is my hood.  This is my shit.  That's bullshit, man.  You can't...  You cannot...  How are you going to claim shit you don't own?  You live in the projects.  Hey, hey, hey.  But this is my shit.  I'm feeling you.  I'm feeling you.  You feeling me, Holmes?  Yeah.  I love you guys, man.  You know, I don't always agree with Anthony.  Of course not.  We do agree on, and I can tell you this, Anthony.  Yeah.  There's a percentage of black people in America who do agree with you. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, I know.  I know.  Yes.  But most of them are not black Americans.  They're probably like from the islands and stuff like that, like Roy Ennis from the Virgin  Islands.  Yeah.  Anthony's right.  They misbehave here.  They're marbling for behave.  Tell them to behave.  Tell them to behave.  They don't like us either.  They don't like us either.  They don't like black Americans.  They think we are lazy.  They think we've been afforded all this opportunity, and we've done shit with it.  And we black people having problem with Africans and Jamaicans because they feel like, well, 
[02:05:30]  if we were given that opportunity, we'd run this place.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, buddy.  Let me go to Harlem, man.  Ezra.  What's up, Ezra?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hello.  Anthony, why is it that every single thing that you point out that has to do with a black  person, it's wrong, but if the role was reversed, like this girl who's eating spaghetti on the 
[02:06:00]  train, if she was white, it wouldn't be an issue.  No, it would still be an issue.  I said it wouldn't be, but it would be.  I just don't think anybody, people can't be trusted to eat neatly and not make a fucking  mess and bring bugs and rats and fucking bed bugs and all kinds of other shit.  Who do you think's bringing bed bugs into our hotels in this fucking country?  Foreigners. 
[02:06:30]  It's the black folk.  No, no.  Foreigners.  Anthony is, I have to say this, Anthony.  Europeans, probably.  He's actually a member of PAPE, which is people against public eating.  I was trying to keep that under wraps.  Honest to God, the last couple of days, dude, you have been on a tear, you pairing up with  DiPaolo the other day.  That was yesterday.  I've had to turn off the show.  What's the matter?  You can't.  What's the matter?  Why do you have to?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:07:00]  Why do you have to turn off the show?  You can't, and that's fine if you do, but the reason behind it is like you can't take  listening to other opinions or you can't take hearing maybe even a piece of the truth.  And I've been listening to you all for years.  Yeah.  For years.  I've heard especially through the whole Obama thing.  Right.  And I'm fine with that.  But, dude, your whole thing is if it's black, it's wrong.  When a dude called up the other day, hey, you know, I love black people.  Freaking, I could hear. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, you're not hiding it too well these days.  You're really not.  Well, someone has to speak out.  Someone has to speak out, sir, because no one else in any mainstream media is speaking  out on behalf of white America and saying that black people, in essence, are really  getting a bit out of control in certain aspects.  Every video you see of people going crazy in fucking department stores and fucking, what 
[02:08:00]  do you think?  No one has cell phones with cameras on it when white people are going crazy?  How come there aren't 8,000 fucking videos of white people going berserk in fucking Chuck  E. Cheese and in H&M clothing stores and Burger King?  Huh?  I have no problem with that.  My problem with you is that if it's black, it's wrong.  You see black.  A whole lot of black people.  Yes, yes, I do.  I do.  I do.  I do see color.  You know what?  Our cultures, our cultures are very different and people never want to accept that or even 
[02:08:30]  discuss it.  We are from different cultures and we embrace different cultures and different values and  ideologies.  Not all people.  There are some crossover in the middle ground.  But on the whole, I think the majority even, I'll say, there's a grave difference in cultures  that clash.  There's a clash there.  There's a misunderstanding of ideology, of ethics, of morality.  And we don't get along like we would like to in this country. 
[02:09:00]  And it's never pointed out except by me.  But Ezra, do you think that...  If you choose to look at it from that perspective, if you choose to look at it from a perspective  where you are not judgmental, sure, we're all going to be biased in our views, but you  are looking at it clearly from a position, everybody over there who's got that doggy skin  is wrong.  No.  No, that's wrong.  No.  I don't.  That white girl that messes with that black guy. 
[02:09:30]  Woo!  She's tainted.  Why?  Because she was just with the black guy.  Oh my goodness.  A couple guys...  That's right.  You're right.  He doesn't mess with the black guy.  He does do that.  You're right.  Let me tell you something.  You're right.  When I bring up a white girl with a black guy, I will sit there...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  When I bring up a white woman with a black gentleman and I say anything about it, that's  pretty much all that's going to happen. 
[02:10:00]  How about what happened in the news the other day where a white guy was with a black woman  and four black guys beat the living fuck out of him because they didn't like him dating  a black girl and was asking the black girl, why are you with that white boy?  Why are you with that cracker?  And beat the shit out of him.  Now there's the difference.  I'll talk about it.  I'll discuss it.  Open it up for debate instead of beating the fuck out of somebody.  Black people tend to be a little more violent in their racism than white people do these 
[02:10:30]  days.  Let me go over to Howard Beach and look at black women.  Let me go over to Howard Beach and look at black women.  Let me go over to the breast that hurt.  Excuse me.  I know no...  How about I go uptown?  How about I go uptown and put a black girl on my arm and see my...  Let me get my ass handed to me.  Here's the thing.  You can roll uptown.  I cannot go where you go.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  And if I got...  If I...  Here's the difference.  If I did get the shit beat out of me uptown and you got the shit beat out of you in fucking  Bensonhurst, it would be a hate crime on one and wouldn't be on another. 
[02:11:00]  Okay?  Excuse me.  It would be a hate crime on one and it would be murder on the other.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  There's a fucking white guy in prison right now for beating up a black guy that was  robbing cars.  All right?  Robbing cars in a fucking neighborhood.  He's in prison.  It was labeled a hate crime.  There are plenty of dead white people and fucking crippled ass white people that got  their asses handed to him for being white in a black neighborhood.  No other reason.  And nothing happened as far as race crime goes.  Nothing happened. 
[02:11:30]  We will never acknowledge hate crimes when it's a black perp and a white victim.  We just will not acknowledge it.  You're not going to start talking about the amount of dead people who died at the hands  of white people.  I will.  I've talked about that.  There was grave injustice that was done for many years.  That's over, Johnny.  It's over.  It's over.  They're not white.  There is now reparations going on with a disproportionate amount of violence against white people 
[02:12:00]  perpetrated by black people.  So that's your reparations.  Enjoy.  Enjoy fucking with white people with impunity.  Go ahead.  Enjoy fucking white people over with complete impunity.  There's your reparations.  Come on, man.  Not right.  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  I think so.  Okay.  You know something.  Can't we just get along?  You're really okay, guys.  I like you, too.  I love you guys.  Really.  I do.  I love the black man.  Wow.  I love you and I love the show.  I got scared.  Love you. 
[02:12:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you, Ezra.  Take care.  Do you got something, Eric?  I think we healed that up at the end, though.  Do you got something that can maybe bring us all back up to the fun part of the...  Bowling for B.  Friday.  Friday.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Everything's okay with the world.  Yeah.  Ice Cube was in Friday.  Friday.  Mike Epps was in Friday.  Friday.  Chris Tucker was in Friday.  I didn't know much black people because I saw the movie once.  It's called Classic and it had a couple of sequels to it. 
[02:13:00]  Friday.  Which weren't as good as the original Friday.  Knocked the fuck out.  Big slogan comes from Friday.  Friday.  I like black actors and black actresses and black movies, too.  Ant does not.  He won't watch them.  He only watches half of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  Yes.  He doesn't even know Sidney Poitier was in that movie.  See? 
[02:13:30]  We'll be back.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show on Twitter.  O.P.  Twitter.com slash O.P. Radio.  Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Moving to our Friday.  Our Friday.  Friday.  We got Nancy from Sparkle Markets.  She has a flub on the local Ohio news, Ant. 
[02:14:00]  Never good when this happens.  And I want to play that Bertation from yesterday.  I think it's worth playing one more time before we put it to bed.  The guy from, what, a Toronto news station?  First, we'll do this one, though.  Good old Nancy from Sparkle Markets.  And this morning, Nancy from Sparkle has a nice addition to your next cup of Joe.  Nancy, what are you working on this morning?  That's right.  We're making our pistachio biscotti.  Biscotti.  I said it a little bit like the DeLaRontis girl might say it on the Today Show. 
[02:14:30]  And it does go great with coffee.  And it is a wonderful chocolate biscotti.  So don't go away.  That's coming up in Sparkle's great groceries.  She loves the cock.  She can't get her mind off the cock.  Can't get enough of it.  Goes great with cock.  My boy.  Loves cock.  He's coming in next week, isn't he?  I know.  I'm so fucking excited.  I am so.  It'll probably be a bust, but who cares?  I'm going to beg him to follow me. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to go for the beg.  I'm going to beg.  Those Norm tweets.  Norm tweets are the best.  He's out of his fucking mind.  Yeah.  Hey, coming in, promoting Comedy Central.  Yeah.  Doing a, what do you call it, a special.  Sports show.  Yeah.  Doing a sports show.  Norm knows his sports.  Norm does.  I think he gambled a lot on sports, too.  Oh, yeah?  I think he might have dipped into that a little bit.  I want to hear some of the stories from his side of the stories that we heard from former 
[02:15:30]  SNL people, like Brewer and Jay Moore and stuff.  They have some good stories.  That he was hoarding jars of his own urine in his office.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Remember that?  Yeah.  We got to write that shit down.  I want to hear about that.  We got to ask him about all that.  Yeah.  Here's the bertation that happened out of Toronto, in case you missed it this week.  Oh, him and Colin are going to be in together?  Yeah, we got Colin Quinn coming in as well, Tim.  Yeah, well.  They were on SNL together, right?  Yeah.  There was, yeah, a couple, a few years there.  Yeah.  They were on together. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, out of Toronto, we get this bertation.  Get that view from killing civilians.  So if it takes ground forces, it's going to be at ground forces.  Meaning it may have only just begun.  Mark McAllister, Global News.  Now, Defense Minister McCain-McClyle did confirm today that more than 54, 18 fighter jets are spending about as much as 20  and ready to assist the 600 deployed over the announced needed. 
[02:16:30]  Now, it did depend on how the no-land emerges our end while the university or the U.N. mission has whole received support from all batteries in the hues of the garbans of today.  Excuse me.  The hues of the garbans of today.  Thank you, Mark McAllister from Japan tonight.  No, don't just say, thank you, Mark McAllister.  Thank you.  The hues of the garbans.  At the very least, you go, are you okay? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Should we call a doctor?  Not thank you.  Are you one of the hues of the garbans today?  I think I am.  Garbans.  Back to the garbans.  He was in Japan, that guy?  What are you fucking, are you talking with your face over a reactor?  What are you babbling about?  Just over the steam.  He's trying.  He's got a steamy face.  A steamy face.  I know.  He thought it was a Vicks vapor rub.  It's radiation, you boob. 
[02:17:30]  Move away from that shit.  It's affecting you.  God, what the hell?  But the thank you, Mark McAllister gets me every time.  Yeah.  Have a moment.  Exactly.  Have a holy shit moment.  You should have at least thanked Bob McAllister for Wonderrama.  That's what I would have done in that situation.  Eddo.  Wouldn't you just go, what the fuck did you just do?  Yeah.  Fucking believable.  Yeah.  And she just trotted right along.  Well, we got Nancy Grace.  She's a terrific woman.  Yeah?  Oh, she's just lovely. 
[02:18:00]  What did she do?  And then we'll do Nick Cannon.  I see you, Sam.  Oh, Sam's wandering.  Hangin' around for a mic time.  We'll get to you.  Stop wandering in with your fucking shitty sock eyebrows.  We'll get to you.  Sock eyebrows.  I'm not asking you to play Nick Cannon.  I just want to run down from the office.  They are furry.  Exactly.  Do you do anything with those?  Like this one's...  This one is sticking up.  You don't shoot them down?  No, I don't.  You should trim them with a shotgun.  Does Jess like those?  She couldn't.  Those eyebrows.  How croochie.  The fucking Velcro. 
[02:18:30]  I was on Skype with her yesterday, and her friend was there.  Oh, her friend?  Yeah.  Who was this?  Her female friend.  Right.  It wasn't Jose?  No, Juan.  Juan?  I forget.  Juan was the other day.  Today's Jose.  Some guy from a cartel.  He lives in the favelas.  He takes her up there, and he gives her a fucking...  He wants to show her what it's like to be fucked with no roof on the house.  That's all they do in Brazil is fuck well.  She's being plowed.  There's no windows.  A fucking crow living in the house.  A horse.  I got a new Sam observation.  What's that? 
[02:19:00]  Do you feel like you're always in the shade?  Why is that?  Because this part sticks out a lot.  Oh, yeah.  There's like a shadow.  I'm looking at your eyes, and there's constantly shadows because this part.  Yeah.  Do you feel like you're in the shade all the time?  No.  You have a natural visor.  I guess.  I mean, I get sun in my eyes sometimes.  You would be good in the outfield.  Yeah, yeah.  It could really...  I don't know if it's that exaggerated.  No?  I don't think so.  I see some shadows, though.  Maybe. 
[02:19:30]  Look at Jim Norton.  He doesn't have any shadows.  None.  Well, yeah.  I guess my head...  That's why my nickname in high school was the no shadow kid.  The old kid.  It's a weird nickname.  No shadow kid with all hyphens.  What's this Nancy Grace thing about?  Danny.  Any one question?  Oh, I was like, what?  She's a Nancy Grace expert.  Just to set up.  Well, Ope, you know how you've been saying that all these news people are nuclear experts?  Oh, yeah.  Well, the next expert is apparently Nancy Grace. 
[02:20:00]  She knows everything that there is to know about radiation.  Oh, wonderful.  And she knows more than the meteorologist does about how radiation gets across the planet.  Oh.  And wasn't he the guy that became the expert first?  I suppose.  What channel is Nancy Grace on?  CNN.  Isn't she?  No.  No.  CNN headline news.  Headline news.  Oh, headline news.  I'm afraid it's the weather guy that I hate.  I think it's a different guy.  Oh, fuck.  I think.  I'm not positive.  All right.  Because there's a weather guy that takes himself way too seriously.  Matter of fact, we got him yelling at... 
[02:20:30]  Could you find that?  Hmm.  I think Travis is panicked.  Well, I can find it if it's been put into let.  No, we've played this a bunch of times, and actually, it's a big YouTube video where  the weather guy starts yelling, like, I'll explain it to you, Cameron.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was during Katrina.  I hate that guy.  That was during Katrina.  Yeah.  He's still on, and he was the one ant that got overexcited about it.  All of a sudden, he became an expert on radiation and nuclear power plants.  That was the same guy? 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I thought I recognized his douchery.  That guy's a twat.  We could certainly get it on YouTube, because it's a biggie.  Damn.  What?  Let that guy in is what he was trying to say.  Just say it.  Our guest.  Well, I was just trying to not be too fucking distracting.  Hey, raggedy Ann hair.  Open the door.  All right.  Here's Nancy Grace versus the weatherman about the nuclear power plants and radiation.  Tonight, Amid reports that nuclear radiation no longer just in the air there in Japan, but 
[02:21:30]  now in the food, water, livestock, produce, supplies.  Produce.  Produce.  Is her mouth real tight?  Produce.  Yeah.  You know, when I was listening to that clip, I noticed that, too.  Like, she really talks like an asshole.  Too much Botox, I'm thinking.  Is that it?  Yeah, it'll get to you after a while.  Produce.  Produce.  Ladies.  Maybe a couple injections, but relax a little bit.  You start freezing up too much shit.  You're going to sound like Nancy Grace.  What does she look like these days? 
[02:22:00]  I don't know what she looks like at all, actually.  You don't know who Nancy Grace looks like?  I've seen her, but I blocked her out.  You know if you've seen her.  She does.  She's talking like Reese Witherspean.  Spean.  Hi, I'm Reese Witherspean.  That's her.  You know her.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  She's so hateable.  Look at that face.  Fucking dopey Markie Post hairdo.  She should be getting raped in a fucking Lifetime special.  And then not.  Or not a Lifetime special.  Going back to Bugs Bunny.  She's got the hair of that monster.  Ah, yes.  Gossamer.  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  I can't say that.  Monsters are such interesting people.  She needs that dynamite hairdo.  Oh, yeah.  And, fear.  That radiation is coming via food to the U.S.  Also, new plumes of smoke.  New plumes.  That's like water.  She sounds like water.  New plumes of smoke.  New.  What happened to her voice?  New plumes.  Man, radiation is coming in reaction number three, man.  Can I, please? 
[02:23:00]  Man, Fukushima is being a dodo, man.  She's talking like that.  What happened to her voice?  What an affected twat.  I'm telling you.  How will this affect Reese Witherspoon?  Fucking Botox, man.  I'm playing on the Botox.  Can we get that fucking new?  Oh, fuck.  New pimp.  Botoxing her tongue?  What do you think?  I'm a rookie?  I fucking backed that shit up right away.  I backed that shit up.  Supplies.  Hey, supplies.  She's speaking Japanese.  Oh, Japanese. 
[02:23:30]  To the U.S.  Also, new plumes of smoke right away.  She's fucking horrible.  New plumes.  Snack.  She's terrible.  You stupid, G.  To the U.S.  Well, the food.  Food is good, too.  Food.  Food.  Food.  Fears.  That radiation is coming via food to the U.S.  Also, new plumes of smoke rising from two of the nuclear reactors there in Japan. 
[02:24:00]  It was believed that there was progress being made over the weekend.  But no more.  Straight out to Bernie Raynaud, senior meteorologist, AccuWeather.com.  Bernie, explain how this is going to affect us.  You have to plug the website while you're talking about fucking Japanese.  You're talking about radiation meltdown.  You fucking hole.  And you had to plug the website.  It's a good place for a plug.  Japanese bodies floating by.  Check it out on HeadlineNews.com.  You fucking vulture.  Slash Nancy Grace. 
[02:24:30]  You had to get the fucking branding in there.  AccuWeather.com.  Gilbert's terrible, though.  Gilbert should be fired.  He's terrible.  Yeah.  You weren't here for our Gilbert thing, right?  I might have been.  We talked about it.  What's a real crime in that situation?  Aflac does a lot of business in Japan.  Oh, yeah.  We did talk about that.  And I said this, that the real crime is all the people that are going to put claims in  and they're going to figure out a way to not pay that claim.  Yeah.  That's the real crime here because you know that's going to happen because that's what  insurance companies do.  They figure out how they don't pay claims. 
[02:25:00]  They're scum.  Fucking.  And really quick, I was at the gym and I saw the greatest news tease ever.  And I couldn't stick around to find out the story, so maybe someone could help me.  They showed a car flying the wrong way on a highway and someone had their camera right  next to it.  So they're going the right direction in the right lane.  I think I saw that one.  And then the traffic, the oncoming traffic, you know, there's a divider in between the  highway, right?  He's going the same speed as his car going the wrong fucking way. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I think I saw that one.  And they just go, stick around and we'll show you how this ends up.  He crashed.  He did.  Yeah.  Because I didn't want to stick around on a stupid cardio machine to find out.  I put in another mile or two.  But I actually said to the TV, bravo.  Bravo.  For a great news tease.  That was a good tease.  Bravo.  Yeah, because you're going to want to stick around and see how that went.  It was a crash and where was that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I forgot what that was.  It was a while ago.  Now that's not a new clip.  No.  Then why would they play an old clip?  I don't know.  I thought it was a new clip. 
[02:26:00]  I remember seeing it.  Was it like a black sedan?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It seemed like it was a local story.  CNBC is unwatchable with the fucking 300 graphics.  Gas oil.  How much is gas oil?  Quick.  The news taker.  What's happening?  Jim Menzio's talk.  Target.  Libya.  100.  9-9.  The opening bell.  Fuck you.  What do you say about the bell?  Yeah.  We're all looking at the bell.  What are the fucking options?  We all got a little action right now, Jimmy.  Who the fuck can't just check on their phones?  Well, look, Jimmy.  Let me break it down. 
[02:26:30]  You got some nice stuff above.  Some NAS.  Pacific time.  Eastern standard time.  Mountain time.  NAS flute.  2, 3, 1, 5.2.  Oh, no.  A turn.  Libor Moss.  0.2.  25%.  And then he went about wave revolution.  Living rebels.  Move to the front.  Pickup trucks.  Oh, no.  There's actually pictures on the TV.  The yen.  How much is the yen?  Commodity summary.  Fucking scrolling by.  And under that, even more.  News to the ticket prices.  Oh, how much is my stock?  And then off to the right.  Opening Bell.  1832, 1831. 
[02:27:00]  The CNBC logo.  God, oh, fucking mighty.  It's exhausting.  My biggest problem with this is this ticker moves faster than this ticker.  Yeah, they notice when it moves together, you can't look at each one individually.  Oh, they figure that out?  Yeah, your eyes kind of see both of them.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty brilliant.  Yeah, but the thing is, you look at the ticker too long and you turn your head, and it feels  like you're moving in the opposite direction of the ticker.  It's a constant, unnecessary fucking visual noise.  There's an explosion right now. 
[02:27:30]  We can't see it.  You can't even see the explosion because their shit is all over the screen.  A bunch of lazy fucking assholes at work in television.  Lazy assholes.  He wore all his medals.  You can't even see them.  He's at the Pentagon talking.  So he didn't need to do all that hard work.  No.  Because no one's going to see your medals anyway if you end up on TV.  I can't see that.  Fucking berserk.  They love waving their guns in the air like they just don't care over there.  Let's get back to Nancy Grace.  Nancy Grace.  New pleams.  New pleams.  I'm praying it's the weatherman I ate.  No, it's a different guy.  What happened? 
[02:28:00]  I bit the side of my mouth where I bit yesterday.  And you know what?  It's going to swell up and make it so hard to chew.  It's not going to heal anytime soon.  You know what fixes that?  Cum.  Why is it still bothering me?  Should have healed already?  Yeah.  I was drinking.  The magic salve.  I made cum-sicles.  Put a cigarette butt in my cold cum and put it in the fridge.  Cigarette butt to hold it?  Yeah.  That's very clever, Uncle Paul. 
[02:28:30]  You have a cum-sicle.  Cool for the summer.  God damn.  Here's Nancy Grace.  Yes.  Bernie, explain how this is going to affect us.  Well, in the United States, I don't think there's going to be a big impact at all.  Bravo to that guy, because that's what the news is doing.  So I can only imagine what she's going to say next.  But the fact is, yeah, radiation is hitting the West Coast.  And they've already said the people that are honest with the people saying it's nothing to worry about.  We get more radiation just doing normal shit. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Okay?  You know, I think the radiation is...  Bernie.  Oh, boy.  Don't fucking do it, Nancy.  Oh, here she goes.  Don't fucking do it.  Here she goes.  Bernie.  Because there are a few people that are slipping, because they'll never be asked back on these news channels,  because you've got to keep the fear going.  Keep the fear going.  You get a few newbies that don't realize that's what the news is all about.  And they go, look, the radiation is nothing.  It's way below what we usually get when we're flying airplanes and eating and all that crap. 
[02:29:30]  But watch.  She's got to bring it back to the fear.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Yeah, Bernie.  You're not making these people scared.  You know, I think the radiation is...  Oh, boy.  Here we go, Nancy.  Huh?  Yeah.  Here we go.  This is not heading to the United...  Bravo.  Oh, shit.  This guy's great.  Bravo.  Good.  Bravo.  Oh, he's fucking calling...  What about the plumes?  What about the plumes?  He's so annoyed, because he knows what she's trying to do.  Yes.  Finally, someone... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, wow.  This is good.  You know, I think the...  Bernie.  The radiation is...  Bernie.  Oh, boy.  Here we go, Nancy.  Huh?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Nancy, this is not heading to the United States.  That's what you said last time, and...  And I'm going to continue to say it, Nancy.  There's a state of emergency declared in California.  This is not...  A state of emergency.  State of emergency, really?  Is there a radioactive state of emergency?  The only problem in this clip is the fact that he's saying the radiation isn't hitting  the United States.  It is.  It has. 
[02:30:30]  But the levels are very, very, very low.  There's no state of emergency because of radiation in California.  A state of emergency.  There's a state of emergency declared in California.  This is not damaging radiation in the United States.  It's one billionth of what is needed to cause any problems.  The state of emergency in California, from what I remember from last week, was from the  damage from the tsunami.  That's what the Japanese government said, too.  Don't worry. 
[02:31:00]  She just can't admit this.  Bernie!  Bernie!  She has to fucking keep...  Bernie, listen!  Listen, Bernie!  Bernie!  She can't...  What a twat.  She fucking stinks.  Love that alarm.  God, is she awful.  Bernie!  What a cunt.  She wanted to keep the fear going.  What a twat.  She's fucking horrendous.  From what I remember from last week, was from the damage from the tsunami.  Yeah, that's what the Japanese government said, too.  Don't worry.  Everything's fine. 
[02:31:30]  It's not fine in Japan.  Absolutely not.  I would never say that.  This is a big concern for Japan.  This is not a big concern for the West Coast of the United States.  And maybe we should just agree to disagree on this one.  Well, could you explain to me, then, why the California governor has declared a state  of emergency?  For radiation?  Maybe he should hear your weather report.  Radiation?  That's one billionth of what is before its damage? 
[02:32:00]  I got to stop this, because we got a great asshole in his feedback.  He goes, Bernie rules, but he spelled it B-U-R-N-I-E, because that's how he's saying it.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  That's Eric.  He's a regular Virginia Tech.  I got to acknowledge you today.  She's fucking horrendous.  What a cunt.  She's just trying to fucking keep the fear going.  This guy's calling her out on it, and she can't just listen.  What a fucking cunt.  He would know. 
[02:32:30]  He's the fucking expert.  Is he a regular weather guy?  Probably not anymore.  Well, they'll probably make him just go back to doing cold fronts and warm fronts, because  your bosses don't like this.  They want the...  State of emergency!  You've got to keep the fear going for the viewers.  You have to do it, no matter what.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Radiation?  That's one billionth of what is before its damage? 
[02:33:00]  You know, no matter how you slice this, this is not headed toward the United States as far  as the damage is radiation.  It didn't head to the United States with Chernobyl, which was volumes bigger than what we have  going on in Japan.  This is a huge concern in Japan, no doubt about it.  That has to be taken care of, but it's not for the United States, not the damaging radiation.  It doesn't just magically appear.  It's got to get here, and the large amounts aren't.  Okay, speaking of magic, Bernie, all of that is sleight of the hand, smoke and mirrors. 
[02:33:30]  There's no such thing as magic.  Let me school you.  School you.  You're a meteorologist.  I'm just a JD.  Okay.  I'm just a JD.  Okay.  I'm just a trial lawyer.  But I know the radiation...  Of course, there you go, right there.  That's why she's such a cunt.  I'm just a trial lawyer.  Exactly.  Just an argumentative bitch who can't admit when she's wrong.  Which means it doesn't matter.  The facts don't matter.  Exactly.  It's like I can work around the facts.  Watch what I do because I'm a trial lawyer. 
[02:34:00]  I'm a trial lawyer, are you?  Then you know about smoking mirrors, you bitch.  I'm just a JD.  I'm just a trial lawyer.  You're an FNC.  But I know the radiation comes across the ocean.  It is dissipated by wind current and salt spray.  But it is reaching the shore of California.  Yeah, he said that.  There.  It is.  He said that.  Whether you want to tell me it's an inisual amount.  He said that.  So you're telling me that radiation, it says made in Japan.  There's radiation all over the place every single day. 
[02:34:30]  But you're talking the damaging radiation.  That's the thing we're most concerned about.  And even in Chernobyl, that didn't get to the United States in damage amounts.  Okay, you know what, Bernie?  From your mouth to God's ear.  From my mouth.  From your mouth to God's ear.  From my fist to your mouth.  That was her.  He just fucking destroyed her.  He skewed her.  He skewed her.  I don't advocate any broad being belted.  Oh, I do.  Except her. 
[02:35:00]  Why not?  By Bernie.  You think Bernie should belt her one?  Bernie, what are you doing?  I'd think if Bernie threw his shit at her like a chimp.  Right in her fucking stupid affected voice and her dopey hairdo.  I like Bernie.  Bernie's my pal now.  I'm so glad Bernie fucking called her out.  Oh, God.  She got caught with her fear monitor.  I know that radiation comes across the sea in Biotes.  It takes a Biot. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, fuck her.  Fuck her.  She should team up with Reese Witherspoon.  That would be a terrific TV show.  Hi, I'm Reese Witherspoon.  Bjornie.  Bjornie.  Bjornie.  Yuck.  Let me say, wow, I can't take that call.  That's just too much today.  Let's hear it.  Come on.  What is this?  I can't do that.  Oh, come on.  All right, sure.  Jay in Georgia.  Jay, this is Jay's thought.  I just wanted to say how much I hate that woman. 
[02:36:00]  I want to rape her.  Oh, stop that.  See, that's just not us.  We don't advocate that at all.  Yes, we're down to 10 female listeners.  Stop it.  That's not going to make them happy today.  Has a judge due type show in the afternoon.  I know where Nancy Grace comes from.  I never watched her dumb fucking court show ever.  Let me say hi to Tony in Dallas.  Home of the Dallas Cowboys.  Cowboys.  Tony.  Yo.  By the way, it's Tony Dorsett. 
[02:36:30]  Big fan of the show.  Hi, Tony.  What's up, Mr. Dorsett?  What do you got for the show?  I know what that video you're talking about with that guy driving the wrong way.  Yeah.  They did a, on 60 Minutes, they did a segment on the guys, the old guy.  I guess I lost what I was going to say.  I got to punch out.  I know what you mean, though.  I just want to know what happened.  And it says the car crashed, but he's, I think he's thinking of another video.  No, he had a collision.  I think I know which one, Anthony.  Is that from Philly, that other one?  I think I saw it.  I heard it's an old bitch from Philly.  That's what I'm hearing, too. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, and that, thank you.  We got to play that.  Yeah.  Okay, that's, this is the wrong way.  Yeah, this is the one, right.  And when is that from?  It's got to be recent.  Yeah.  I'll see if it looks the same.  Guys, you got it.  Windshield wipers going.  Love that.  This is not the one I'm thinking of.  Oh.  Can I ask, Cam Ant?  You know this shit.  Wait.  I don't know.  What is he holding up?  I don't know why he's even fucking.  I know, that's holding a camera. 
[02:37:30]  It might be a dash.  Oh.  And now he's, now he's catching up to a car that you see in the distance.  Oh, right.  You can see it.  This guy is driving down the wrong side.  It's 309.  Oh, I see.  Between Telford and Souderton.  It'd be funny if it was him driving the wrong way.  I got to call this guy out in a second, too.  I'll tell you in a second.  Probably not the best idea.  Wow.  And not the best idea for you to be in the lane you're in.  Because when that crash happens, everything's going to fly into his lane.  Get in the fucking granny lane. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  Wow, this guy's fucking.  This guy's got balls.  I'm pretty fast, though.  Who's filming this?  It's a really rainy day, and at any moment, there could be debris flying at him.  Debris.  Oh, my God.  That's a fucking mess.  That would be so frightening.  Right past the cob.  What?  Why is that guy fucking stopping?  He's still going the wrong way.  Why not just stop?  Could be drunk.  Could be old.  How old is he?  Could be drunk and old.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Still going.  Is he going?  I think he's probably in the shoulder.  This guy's not even catching up. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Wow, that was some trickery.  I thought both cars were stopped.  A left hand.  Wow.  A left hand.  Now there's a cop coming behind me.  Oh, how about you get out of the way?  So I'll get over.  Wow, what a good gentleman.  Probably pulled him over for using a video camera.  Is this from planes, trains, and automobiles?  Yeah.  You're going the wrong way.  What?  All right, now he's behind the fuzz.  I think this could get interesting. 
[02:39:00]  You think?  Better.  There's not much time left on your fucking video.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Anything?  Oh, I'm going to hate the news in about 10 seconds, I think.  Yeah.  I'm going to hate the news in about 10 seconds.  I don't see anything happening.  I could have just read the accompanying article.  I don't know.  I was waving at him to stop.  So.  I guess that's it.  And he stopped.  All right, let me go back to what I said about 20 minutes ago.  So, I'm in the gym, and they go, we'll tell you how this ended up.  How this horrible disaster ends. 
[02:39:30]  So, they wanted everyone to think there was a massive fucking car crash, and it turns out  there was nothing.  But there weren't.  Why wouldn't they just tell you how it ended up?  Why would they have to tease it?  Because they want you to keep watching, Jimmy.  They're such fucking scumbags in the gym to keep watching.  Keep watching.  Oh, I hate them.  You motherfucker.  One thing I'm proud of, I really think we've educated a lot of people on how all this  shit works.  They show?  I really do.  I feel like I'm yelling and nobody hears it.  I feel like I'm whispering into a fan.  Then you'd sound like this.  That's what it feels like.  Why am I for you, man? 
[02:40:00]  Why am I for you, man?  Because on radio, you don't see who's listening, so I just feel like I'm just talking to you  guys and maybe E-Rock when he's in there and not sleeping.  Someone calling you out saying, oh, radio, you guys don't tease bits?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but we're not the fucking news.  We don't have the...  That's true.  The difference is the news is supposed to be something different.  And we just try to, uh, we...  Huh?  I think the news is supposed to be something different.  It's not supposed to be entertainment radio.  It's supposed to be...  Yeah!  It's supposed to be the, uh, not entertainment.  It's supposed to be the news of the day. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, I think the guy's got sort of a point.  But we're not...  Not at all.  But we're not the news.  When we're on regular radio, we don't enjoy the same content freedom the news does.  Did that happen?  Oh, wait, no.  He doesn't have a point.  No point at all.  No point at all.  Sorry, sir.  Because I was thinking about Jersey Shore.  They tease shit, and they're just a dumb entertainment show.  We're tasteless for making fun of things, but the news is considered a highbrow and perfectly  acceptable, although they're doing nothing but exploiting shit and keeping you through  commercial breaks for it.  No point at all.  And he should hand in his fan card.  That's right.  He's done.  And he should hand it on his tongue to my cock. 
[02:41:00]  Whoa.  I should hand things in.  Wow.  All right.  I like receiving things that way.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  And we missed a very good opportunity here.  What happened?  I think we ran out of energy starting the show, so...  We started the show on fucking 11.  We really did.  And then what?  Were we cresting?  Well, because we didn't think of this.  Rich in Wisconsin.  Rich, hold on one second, sir.  Yeah.  Don't say a word.  Don't be broke, don't you, Rich?  All right, Rich. 
[02:41:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Rich.  Yes.  You guys are missing the audio portion of that from the inside the car.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd's going the wrong way!  Down the highway, we're going to see if the airbag goes off when he hits him.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Let me take this phone call.  Turd!  Hi, man.  How's Anthony?  Love the show.  Ah, thank you.  Good luck.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Anthony, I suck.  Oh, did I suck. 
[02:42:00]  You made a salient point.  I gave him a great call.  Asshole.  They gave me the hotline number.  Don't fuck.  They wanted you to become a regular.  I've called five more times.  I know you have.  Uh, Cal, love you.  Love the show.  You probably just say L-Y-L-T-S.  Ah, shit.  I stink, motherfucker.  It's alright.  You made a great point.  I did.  I was a good caller.  At least I took that away from him.  That was one of the greatest swing and misses ever.  Oh, just an abomination. 
[02:42:30]  All our backs hurt.  I sucked on that one.  Dude.  I was already, it was like, I was just ready to fucking go and I heard the click.  Like, he took my point and then commented on it without me on the phone.  And then I just knew, like, oh, fuck, I fucked that one up.  Um, that's alright.  We live in a world where nearly...  In a world.  ...where nearly 40% of Americans...  Oh.  You read this already?  I did, yeah.  Oh, you want to play trivia?  You got that face.  You want to play trivia?  R. 
[02:43:00]  40% of Americans believe in something.  You want to play?  Um, yeah.  Alright.  I'm going to play.  Let it be known Anthony wanted to play trivia today.  I'm going to play.  I'm going to play.  I'm not passing.  Alright, you're not passing?  40% of Americans believe in...  Don't look down.  Don't look down.  They believe in themselves because they drink...  No.  No.  They believe in Crystal Light because...  I fucked up.  They believe in themselves because they drink Crystal Light.  They believe in Crystal Light because it believes in them.  There you go.  Is that the...  Oh, you're right.  Because I believe in... 
[02:43:30]  Crystal meth...  Because...  What?  Linda Evans would be drinking Crystal Light.  Wasn't it Linda Evans?  Something like that.  Some old...  Yeah.  Drinking Crystal Light.  What do you got in?  Squat thrusting.  40%.  Give me a question.  I like when you ask questions.  Okay.  Is it something tangible or spiritual?  Wow.  You're going to get this in three questions today, sir.  Ah.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Yes.  Ah.  Spiritual.  Believe in God. 
[02:44:00]  Correct, but that's not what the point is.  What?  Spiritual, God, 40%, God.  Okay.  Yeah.  Partially right.  Partial.  Right now you give partial credit.  So you got to know...  A supreme being?  No, you got to work with the God thing.  God?  Believe God is a white man with a big white beard.  No.  Give yourself a...  I thought it was that.  Black Jesus?  No.  You got the God part.  God.  40% God.  Believe in God and believe that prayer can solve their problems. 
[02:44:30]  Believe in God except in this building.  Oh, wow.  You're falling apart.  Believe in God.  All right.  40% believe in God.  Yeah, there's a second part of that.  And that he created everything.  Oh.  No, but you...  What did God just...  What did that cover the God part?  I don't know.  When he said...  You're panicking.  When Anthony said that God...  The prayers were something, you were kind of saying just the opposite. 
[02:45:00]  This is the new me, by the way, where only my lips move and my teeth are stationary.  I hate your new character.  It's just because I needed my teeth to be stationary.  I think that the...  You didn't even talk like this.  You had part of it.  You should do that on every talk show you do.  That would be so annoying.  I should get like the Hollywood whitening.  Just go to smile or something.  Like bright smile.  And just really talk like this for all of my lips are moving.  Just be all teeth.  Really annoying.  I can talk like that forever.  Listen, I think that you do have some points.  But your salient point was not... 
[02:45:30]  You were closer to where you think there's...  There's...  Believe in heaven.  No.  And hell.  All right, let's just give up on the trivia.  All right, fuck it.  Really?  I don't care.  Yes.  Because I really don't care.  40% of Americans polled say natural disasters are a sign from God.  From God?  40%?  That seems way high.  Believe in some kind of magic?  That seems way the fuck high.  That's magical.  Dopes.  We're going through a thing.  We're going through a thing right now. 
[02:46:00]  That's all.  Wow.  Let's not forget about the supermooners.  A little close.  So it's causing some shit right now.  It's crazy.  It is, right?  Stupid.  I figured some people thought the natural disasters are a sign from God.  Yeah.  But 40%?  That's a lot.  God love her.  Such a beautiful woman.  She was so beautiful.  She was just...  She was the last movie star.  I'd love to end this bit you're doing with a shotgun.  Just part your teeth.  Don't need to kill yourself.  I'm just not going to stop talking.  Because really, she was the last movie star. 
[02:46:30]  She gave us her grace.  She gave us her elegance.  And right now, she's sitting in a big chair while Michael Jackson dances around her.  My lips get dry when I do this.  Seems there was an earthquake in Myanmar.  You might know it as Burma.  Was it Burma?  It was Burma.  Why did you share that info?  I forgot earlier.  What did I say it was?  Bengal.  Bengal.  Bengal.  Yeah.  Burma.  Myanmar.  I guess there was an earthquake there, huh?  Yeah.  Unless you're top in Japan. 
[02:47:00]  It wasn't anywhere.  No one's really going to care.  Well, it was in an isolated area.  And that, yeah.  You know what I'd like to do?  I'd like to go to Liz Taylor's funeral.  Yeah.  And then while they're doing the eulogy, just cut a fucking horrible, loud, juicy fart.  Why would you like to do that?  Just because it would be so inappropriate.  People would be so mad at me.  It certainly would.  She's up there sitting in a big throne while Michael Jackson dances.  Is he belly dancing?  Or does he have like a ballerina, his fingertips on his head with his arms like little wings?  Surrounded by children. 
[02:47:30]  Is he moonwalking?  Because it's his heaven, too?  Does he have his mask on and his fucking, his shit, papier-mÃ¢chÃ© nose?  Fucking creep with his skin whitening stuff.  I don't whitening my skin.  I'm a vitiligo.  You're not allowed to go to a heaven with papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.  So he's got to just hold his nose for eternity.  Do you think you get the nose back, though, in heaven?  Huh?  You don't get the nose back in heaven?  Well, whatever was left of it.  He's just got a hold in his hand.  Like, let's say you got your leg blown off.  You don't bring clothes and shit to heaven?  In a war.  What?  Let's say you got your leg blown off in a war.  And then, like, fucking, you die 50 years later. 
[02:48:00]  Okay.  When you go to heaven, do you join up with your leg?  Do you now have your two legs?  There's too many questions with heaven.  Strength theory explains that, actually.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't.  String theory.  Let me say hi to Jim.  String of cum from the tip of my dick to your lip.  That's the only string theory I want to talk about.  That's really geeky.  Here's what's the worst part about it.  It implies that I'm not even sucking his dick.  That I'm eagerly waiting with my mouth open while he probably spits in his hand and strokes it. 
[02:48:30]  His dick smells like wine.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  He's a celebrity.  String of cum and I catch it.  It's a party favor.  Tee hee.  Jim in North Carolina.  Yeah, what's up?  Jim.  Yeah, good morning.  I was coming up the floor of the turnpike yesterday up 75 and saw a sign out on the side of the road that said that the Bible guarantees the end of the world is going to happen on May 20th, 2001. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, we've been seeing these.  All right, and I'll tell you why this is complete bullshit and the people that are putting up the signs think it's complete bullshit.  Yeah.  Because wouldn't they be causing all sorts of fucking havoc right now?  What do you mean?  If you had only two months left, wouldn't you be getting some shit done out there in the world?  Oh, if we believed in this stuff?  No, the people that supposedly believe it.  They are.  They're putting signs up.  They're still going to work, I guarantee.  Why would you at least quit your job?  Is it a religious thing?  Is it a religious thing?  Do they think it's religious, like a rapture or something? 
[02:49:30]  Huh?  Because if it's religious, they're just going about their business.  Yeah, but if you quit your job, God's not going to care about that one.  Call your boss and go, you are a bum.  But if you knew the world was ending, why would you keep going to work if you have a shitty job?  That's true.  I'm not going to argue at that point.  I bet you those people are still going to work.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Explain that, people.  It depends on what you do.  Yeah.  If your job is to get blowjobs, like if you're a gums and lip tester in the power industry.  What, sir?  I said, or you could test it in a beauty hole. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know what that means.  A, your connection is stinks.  B, your joke fits right in with your connection.  This is terrible.  Wait, Troy has info on this end of the world thing?  Oh, does he?  Bring Troy in.  Troy Kwan?  Well, no, I just think it's interesting that...  Oh, wow.  Here he comes.  Would this classify as a Kwan-spiracy?  You got a notepad and everything?  The hell is this?  You got a pamphlet?  Oh, it says Holy God on it right there.  You made it up.  Oh, it's a pamphlet.  Yeah, it's from them.  Oh, my God. 
[02:50:30]  The end of the world is almost here.  Holy God will bring Judgment Day on May 21st, 2001.  Sponsored by JÃ¤germeister.  Oh, nice.  I like the JÃ¤germeister.  Judgment Day.  Can we talk to these people?  I've been trying to get a hold of them.  What do they have to lose?  The guy asked, what show did I work for?  And he found out and he was like...  So why would you say Opie and Anthony?  What am I supposed to tell him?  If the world is ending, who cares who he talks to?  It's Greg and Tony.  That's true.  If the world is ending, who cares?  Why would you say Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, Greg and Tony show. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, the boys got to teach a few more things.  There's a lot of scripture.  You never say Opie and Anthony.  We're scumbags.  The Bible is a holy book written by Holy God.  Really?  Really?  Who is the creator of this beautiful world.  The Holy Bible is without question a very ancient book, having been completed about  1900 years ago.  It's in its original language, mostly Hebrew and Greek.  Where does it talk about fucking end of the world?  All scripture is given by the inspiration of God and his prophet. 
[02:51:30]  There's nothing to hear about.  You can't just say it's going to be the end of the world and then not back it up with  some fucking shit.  Let me see.  Be careful.  I'll study the Bible and learn that in the year 4990 BC, God brought a flood of water  and destroyed the entire earth except for eight people and the animals that were given  to them.  That's what he did.  Great guy he is, God.  Eight people get to live in a bunch of birds and llamas.  Their God brought them to the safety of the ark. 
[02:52:00]  Their leader, Noah, had obeyed God's command to build a huge boat called the ark.  About 450 feet.  He doesn't take life seriously, does he?  No, and if you really believe that Noah was the only one left, you're dumb.  And that he built a giant ship that held two of every animal.  Especially newborns, now that I'm a father.  You get these kids, they haven't done shit yet in their lives to have any sin.  And really, God just decided...  Wiped them out.  I got to wipe out all these innocent people that haven't even had a chance to sin. 
[02:52:30]  Get the fuck out.  There was a Noah, and I think he really did build a boat.  They will find the ark, but I don't believe that it was what they said it was.  You know what?  I talked to a guy, his name is Jesus, and you've seen him too, Jimmy.  He's in our neighborhood, and he's Jesus.  In his mind, he's Jesus.  Really?  Of course, he spells it with a G instead of a J.  A Jesus?  But he's a lunatic.  You sure he's not geezer?  He thinks he's the basis for Sabbath?  You see this guy, he's one of the crazy homeless people that's actually scary enough to make 
[02:53:00]  sure you kind of, you know, cross the street.  Here it is.  Oh, you got it all figured out?  Thus, holy God is showing us, by the words of Peter 3.8, that he wants us to know that  exactly 7,000 years after he destroyed the world with the water in Noah's day, he plans  to destroy the entire world forever.  Remember, because the year 2011 A.D. is exactly 7,000 years after 4990 B.C. when the flood  began.  The Bible has given us absolute proof that the year 2011 is the end of the world during 
[02:53:30]  the Day of Judgment, which will come on the last day of the Day of Judgment.  May 21st, 2011 is the 17th day of the second month of the Biblical calendar of our day.  Remember, the floodwaters also began on the 17th day of the second month in the year 4990  B.C.  They kept such good records back then.  Turd?  Turd? 
[02:54:00]  We're going to send turd out in an ark!  What are these assholes going to do on the 22nd?  Well, they're going to get ready to look silly.  What's the date?  May 21st.  May 21st.  So what are they going to do May 22nd?  Judgment day.  I can tell you.  What?  They're going to get ready for my birthday on the 23rd.  Yay!  They're going to be at the right hand of God, and we're all going to be saying shit.  Oh, I hope they all kill themselves.  How awkward will this be if they're right?  Oh, God.  I hope they are.  Is that going to be an awkward moment?  I'd love to be in The Last Generation. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I got my go bag.  I hope they are right.  Because every generation...  We all want to be the last ones.  Yeah.  Because we don't want to realize that we're just fucking hunks of protoplasm.  Sadly, you can't turn to your religion or go to your priest or pastor or spiritual leader for help.  Yeah, because they're too busy diddling kids still.  They, too, should be begging God for mercy themselves.  This is a matter only between you and Holy God.  God knows every one of your thoughts, words, and actions.  Sure he does.  Uh-oh.  Sure he does.  That's awkward, too.  Because that's what he does.  Sometimes when I'm jerking off, I don't even want to know what I'm thinking. 
[02:55:00]  And if God was all-knowing and stuff, I said this the other day, but it's worth repeating.  You've got these priests.  They're diddling kids, right?  Yes.  But it's the kids that believe in the religion.  So why wouldn't you have the priests diddle the kids that didn't believe?  Because God likes to teach...  They say we don't understand his ways.  Right.  And somehow there's a lesson to be learned by a nine-year-old being fucked by an adult.  That's the way God would teach a lesson, I guess.  Yes.  It's great.  Terrific.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  Do they got a hymn for that?  The biblical answers to your questions.  Oh, no hers.  Of course.  All right.  This makes perfect sense now.  Maybe they need some hers and get rid of some hymns.  Or at least a shim.  You're so right.  At least a shim.  Make it look close.  This makes perfect sense now.  Now, for biblical answers to your questions, listen to or call the Open Forum, a live call-in  program on Family Radio, Monday through Friday from 830 to 10 p.m. Eastern.  On Sirius XM's on the radio. 
[02:56:00]  To receive a free program guide of our gospel broadcasts.  Oh, my God.  Give them a call.  Or you can go to their website on the internet.  It's familyradio.com.  Is there a phone number to call in?  I hope there's a message for it.  Wow.  Well, our listeners will give them what it is.  They'll let them know.  Do you think there's a number to call in, though, Ant, to be a part of that program?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  Let's give them some free publicity.  We should.  We really should help them out.  And only real calls.  No bunk.  No bunk. 
[02:56:30]  Family Radio.  Let's see.  Give them a call.  It's 1-800-322-5385.  1-800-322-5385.  And I guess you could get through and call them there Monday through Friday, 830 to 10th.  A couple questions coming in.  Yes, yes.  Because you asked about the leg.  Wait a minute.  In New York?  Okay.  Well, there's a bunch of stations where it could be heard. 
[02:57:00]  I'll give them a plug.  Fuck them.  They're syndicated.  Great.  Yeah, they're all over.  Look at all the stations they have.  They're doing mornings at K-Rock now.  They took our syndication away, but these guys get to be syndicated everywhere.  Great.  Great.  That sounds great.  How can they go on the air?  Like, if we did something, a prank, there'd be all kinds of bullshit.  Obviously, we did a few and got in trouble.  How could you go on the air and say the end of the world is coming?  Wouldn't you like to know how long their contract is for?  If their contract is about May 21st, we know they're full of shit. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, if they just negotiated new contracts for their morning show.  Why doesn't the FCC have a problem with that?  Isn't there a hoax rule?  Yeah, there's got to be a hoax rule.  There's actually something called a hoax rule.  If this doesn't happen...  That's the biggest hoax ever.  Get them fired.  We should just say we're religious programming.  And then we can do hoaxes?  And then we can do anything we want.  All right.  That's true.  We're religious programming.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Hey.  So let it be written, so let it be done.  I've got to read my letter to Corinthians.  No, I think Uncle Paul...  Well, he fits right in.  Yeah.  Right in a little tushy. 
[02:58:00]  It's a good, snug fit.  Grips you like a fist.  Oh, shit.  When they try to run away, it tugs on it.  Oh, God.  Let's...  Oh, is that a horrid Lord.  It pulls the cum right out of you.  Let's say hi to Jeff in North Carolina.  Like a vacuum.  Jeff.  Jeffrey, what's up?  Hello.  Jeff, you say you know about the Bible.  We need you.  Hey, you.  Yeah, go ahead.  What about it, fellas?  How y'all doing? 
[02:58:30]  Hi, Jeff.  Yeah, how you doing, North Carolina?  What do you got?  Anthony asked a question about, you know, if his leg got cut off, whether it will go to  heaven with him or not.  Yes.  Your body don't go to heaven.  Your soul goes to heaven.  Your spirit.  Well, that sucks.  How are we going to be turned on in heaven without body parts?  Exactly.  I'm going to have a wispy heart on.  What does the soul look like?  Yeah, what is it?  Is it misty?  Is it a ball of light?  I don't know what it looks like.  Is it like a fog thing?  Can you see?  Yeah.  It's shaped like a fez hat. 
[02:59:00]  Hey.  Take your eye from wrong, fellas.  Wait, can you see then in heaven?  If you don't have eyes because that's on your body, are you able to see?  And then if you can see, do you see in one direction like eyes would?  Or you can see everywhere?  And I can't understand that.  I think we're all going to be jellyfishing.  Well, you called up, and I figured you're from North Carolina.  You probably know everything.  How about some help?  If your soul goes to heaven, what does that mean?  Can we see each other's souls?  What are the souls?  What do they look like?  Literally, just the souls of our feet.  I like to think. 
[02:59:30]  It's a bunch of.  So, Ellen, there's a spelling error in the Bible.  Everything's been misinterpreted.  God has a foot fetish.  Give me your soul.  Your soul.  So I can crinkle.  Watch them crinkle and come all over them.  I want a big.  That's why he washed the lepers' feet.  It was a fit thing.  He loves the souls.  It wasn't a leper.  It was Bill Lepore.  He notoriously had the nicest feet in Bethlehem.  The nicest feet.  Very soft.  He did have night feet.  He had big fucking metal shoes. 
[03:00:00]  I'm tired.  Let's go to New York.  New York.  Bill Lepore.  We're in New York, and you're in New York.  What do you got?  Hey, Apollo Creed got his hand back in Happy Gilmore.  There you go, Ant.  Oh, Happy Gilmore.  There you go.  The Bible according to Happy Gilmore.  Right.  There you go.  So that guy gets his leg back.  He pulls his body parts back.  I think of him as dealing.  But I think, once again, you've got to hold a leg for eternity, though.  God doesn't put it back on your body.  No.  No.  Well, that's something. 
[03:00:30]  I've got to tinkle badly.  Go.  Go tinkle.  You could go tinkle.  Because we're ramming this right to 10 and getting the fuck out of here.  Fucking A, Bubba.  Fucking A.  I have to be other of it.  All right.  Go tinkle.  Go tinkle.  We're riding this right to 10 now, man.  And don't play with yourself.  Yeah.  Don't play with yourself on my highway.  You could think about it, but don't do it.  Don't do it.  That's an attention-getter. 
[03:01:00]  Aggly.  There goes genius.  Let's say hi to Uncle Luke in L.A.  He's a regular.  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Good evening.  Luke.  Hey, have you seen the signs around Hollywood?  He just said he was leaving.  What?  Shut up, you stupid.  They've got signs all over the place.  Some group bought billboards all over, like Hollywood.  They have an AM station tuned in.  You can listen to them.  They're going to tell you.  Oh, billboard.  Boy, it is Friday. 
[03:01:30]  How do we even know what day it is?  Wait, wait.  Did you say, uh...  I think it's the day before Saturday.  Yeah.  And yesterday was Thursday.  Yeah.  So I know what day it is.  Yay!  Turd!  Turd!  It's Friday!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Yeah!  Ah, what the crazy.  Ah, what the crazy.  Partying.  Yeah.  Partying. 
[03:02:00]  Partying.  Yeah!  Ah!  Ah!  Holy guacamole.  Yeah!  Where else could you put your apprentice?  When I hear partying, this is what I think.  Ah!  You were such a super lady.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Partying.  Partying.  Partying.  Partying.  Partying.  Fun. 
[03:02:30]  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat.  Yes!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I didn't realize.  Ow!  Ow!  I didn't realize.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm sorry I did that.  Ow!  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  No, you're not.  I talked to you about it.  You're certainly not.  I could give a shit that I did that, quite frankly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck him. 
[03:03:00]  We were privy to some things there.  That was great.  It was wonderful.  You don't give a fuck.  No, he's Imus.  Great.  And I think we could do a little Nick Cannon here.  Nick Cannon?  Because I want to see Sam walk down the hall again.  I want to see him run with his dumb feet.  You do?  And his giant eyebrows on his fucking Neanderthal head.  With his clown shoes.  His clown shoes.  He's fucking clown shoes.  Friday.  Friday.  Oh, God.  Fun, fun, fun, fun. 
[03:03:30]  It's got to be fun.  So many.  How many?  Too many funs, though.  Fun, fun, fun.  Three less funs would make that song a little better.  Do you know what?  That song was written by a couple of black guys, right?  It was supposed to be like almost a hip-hop-y kind of song, maybe.  I don't know.  I'm thinking because when she says bowl, it's supposed to rhyme with cereal.  So it's like bowl, cereal.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I noticed that because I'm really kind of picking the song apart now.  It's like, got to get my bowl, got to get my cereal.  Right?  Oh, I gotcha.  Got to get my bowl, got to get my cereal. 
[03:04:00]  I gotcha.  Yeah, not got to get my bowl, got to get my cereal.  I think at this point it's officially a hit song.  It's a hit.  So hit's one.  Do the right thing.  The number one hit tune.  Get that in heavy rotation.  Mm-hmm.  Sam's taking his time.  Friday.  He's doing this on purpose.  Oh, Samuel.  Young Sam.  Get in here.  We should bleed into 10 o'clock and then let his fucking shitty show be only 41 minutes.  Then we'll see who fucking hustles.  Then we'll see who hustles.  Hold this bowl for a second.  You got it.  Then we'll see who fucking hustles. 
[03:04:30]  Hold the bowl.  Get some cereal.  Yeah, have bushy eyebrows.  Look like an asshole with shadows on my eyes.  He has fried hair.  Fried hair.  Look at it.  How did pubes get up there?  Pubic hair.  Pubic hair.  Pubic hair.  Yes.  He looks like he's wearing a wig that would make him a wigger.  I don't know what to go with this. 
[03:05:00]  You know what?  You don't hate the song anymore, do you?  No, I love it now.  I kind of like the song now.  I love the song.  Love the girl.  Yeah, I kind of like the song now.  Love our dumb friends.  Love the car.  Love the front seat.  Love the back seat.  Love fun.  So you guys failed.  You brought it to our attention thinking we'd hate this thing.  And now we like the song.  Love it.  So if I play the Club Soda Kenny clips that you didn't play today, does that still count as  hoarding material?  No, now it fits because we played the song.  Yeah, so you'll do the outtakes in the 10 o'clock hour.  Club Soda Kenny's version of the Friday song.  Do it on your shelf.  Yeah.  On your shelf. 
[03:05:30]  What's Nick Cannon all about today?  I like when you bring Nick Cannon to our attention every once in a while.  Just a little taste.  Today you decide to do that.  You're still alive.  Nick is, of course, the husband of Mariah Carey.  Yeah.  And he does mornings at the station we used to work at, 92.3 K-Rogg.  Well, that's not K-Rogg anymore.  Well, whatever it was.  I was talking about when we worked there.  Now it's now.  Now it's now?  Yeah.  But what was it then?  Now it's now.  What was it then, Abbott?  Get into that whole fuck, clusterfuck bit.  What was the slogan at N.E.W. when we were talking? 
[03:06:00]  We stink musically.  Same shit every five minutes.  FM talk at 1027.  Yeah, really?  Remember that?  That was horrible.  Remember that FM talk phase?  Well, the lineup definitely was all right.  Party and party.  Party and party.  So, Nick Cannon, what's he doing?  Fun, fun, fun, fun?  Front seat, back seat?  What's he doing?  No, none of that stuff.  But he's got a bit called Cannon Calls.  Cannon Calls.  Eight o'clock.  It's got to happen at eight because, you know, if you have a bit, you've got to do it at the same time every day. 
[03:06:30]  Uh-huh.  Is it from the old TV show Cannon, and he plays when Cannon used to use his mobile phone in his car?  Mobile operator, give me 555-3826.  That's not what it is.  No?  And it had a cord on it, a spirally cord like his house.  He'd pull it up from the hump in the middle of his fucking seat.  He had a bench seat because he was a big fat fuck.  Yeah.  Cannon.  I don't remember that show.  It was on when Mannix was on and stuff.  Where have you been?  Yeah, I don't remember that show. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Cannon.  A Quinn Martin production.  Cannon.  Big fat fuck.  Drives around in his car.  What he does today.  Oh.  Episode.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  William Conrad.  William Conrad.  See as he pulls into a jiffy lube and gets new shocks on the driver's side again this week.  I just love the fact that that entire thing was fat jokes. 
[03:07:30]  Because he was fat.  Cannon.  He'd be chasing somebody.  He's fucking winded after three steps.  He pulls out a little .38 snub nose.  It looks like a fucking toy gun in his big fat hand.  I love that show.  Cannon.  I'm trying to find a tweet, and I just came upon one you did in the middle of the night.  This is completely random.  Yeah.  Wow.  Were you just fighting everyone last night?  No, I do faux fights at night just to retweet people. 
[03:08:00]  I see a million tweets from you.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't tweet this much usually.  I was retweeting people.  And Danny Moody wrote, this is just random.  I'm going to acknowledge this.  We're not even talking about this right now.  It's my motorcycle now, Danny Moody.  It says, Danny Moody writes,  Don't you have to work in three hours?  So, obviously, this was about 2, 2, 2.30 in the morning.  And you wrote, yes, work at fucking your mom.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  I like that.  I just ask a question.  Sometimes I get right to the point. 
[03:08:30]  But he's just asking a question.  You know what?  He's asking the same question I get asked every time I either tweet or fucking do something  past like 10 o'clock at night.  If I do something at 10.30, if I tweet, wait, shouldn't you be sleeping?  I guess it's going to be your best of tomorrow.  Why aren't you in bed?  Shut up.  Why is Gary twittering you?  We're not in bed because we don't take this seriously anymore.  Right.  So we stay up late.  Everyone should know. 
[03:09:00]  And we're enjoying our lives.  Look, I fucking go home sometimes and from 10.45 till 8 at night, I sleep.  You want to hear a funny story?  I fucking, this is going to, I didn't sleep the night before because I was on the old  plane-a-roo.  And I dozed off, I went and did S.E. Cup show yesterday on the Glenn Beck network.  S.E. rules.  And then I went home and slept for, it was supposed to be an hour, it was like five hours.  It's the last time I can't sleep.  I'm in a fucking, I'm upside down again.  Now you're fucked up, but you got the weekend. 
[03:09:30]  You got the weekend.  You could straighten it out, right?  What do you mean the weekend, Ant?  What do you mean?  Starting with when?  Today.  Yay!  Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Woo!  Weekend week.  Friday, Friday.  Get down on Friday.  Yeah!  Yes!  The weekend.  Training bra, training bra, yeah!  Training bra, training bra.  Yeah.  I'm dry.  Fun. 
[03:10:00]  I just got my pubes.  No.  No hair down there.  No hair down there.  No hair?  I'm picturing a little hair.  Okay.  Well, that's your, uh, preference.  Friday, Friday.  Got my little nubs a-growing.  Yeah!  Um.  Weekend, I'm sexy to pedos.  Yay!  Sexy to pedos.  I probably shouldn't do this, but, um, I got in trouble yesterday.  What happened?  I got, I can't help myself, though.  And, and, and, uh, I gotta keep- 
[03:10:30]  What you don't know.  Did you finger the paper boy?  Again?  I gotta kinda keep it vague.  But, uh, I, uh, I re-  Did you see my tweet on Howard Stern?  No.  I forgot to tell you, I got in trouble for it.  And I follow you now, so I don't even-  I follow you!  Oh, look at that.  I follow both you motherfuckers.  What?  Uh, we're officially-  We're officially all following each other, so everyone relax.  Wow.  Although I was following these guys through-  Party and party.  Something called funny people, but it's, it's, oh, whatever. 
[03:11:00]  Funny people?  Yeah.  Funny how?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Funny peeps.  Funny peeps?  Because I'm obsessed with old fucking, like, uh, language.  And peeps is-  So is Antwin describing certain people.  Yes, of course.  Ha ha ha.  Yes.  I love the old vernacular.  Um, well, so Howard Stern tweeted yesterday.  I don't know why I'm doing this to myself.  Uh-oh.  I can't help it, though.  That's my, my only excuse.  He wrote, on my way for my yearly physical and anticipating that finger in my ass. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, boy.  And he writes, doesn't get better than this.  And I wrote, as serious gets your fist in their ass.  Oh, boy.  Hey, that's, all right, that's pretty good.  I thought so.  I thought people around here had a sense of humor, but without getting into details, just  like I said the other day about how is that good for the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You might want to blah, blah, blah, blah.  They're a little sensitive, blah, blah, blah, right now.  There's a loss there.  Not, I don't think there's a bat. 
[03:12:00]  You think he does that when he gets the finger?  He goes, like, ooh.  Like when he dropped the carts in private parts.  I think he does what the rest of us do.  He comes on his leg.  And then the doctor awkwardly tells you it's not really calm.  It's just a reaction.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I'm the only one.  What happened?  You can stop pushing back on my knuckles now.  I'm only putting the finger in.  Exactly.  Stop saying it's a twofer.  Get it?  It's like, Doc, can't you squeeze it like a plum?  More gay jokes. 
[03:12:30]  We just love gay jokes.  Oh, we certainly do.  We're very gay friendly.  Because guys are getting to that point where they get the finger up the ass.  And you will have that awkward discussion with your doctor.  And as long as the jellyfish portion of the cum seeds doesn't come out.  With the jellyfish?  It's not.  Oh, that.  Yeah, it's not.  If it's just the liquid that they swim in.  It's not a gay reaction.  Yeah.  If it's just the fluid.  Just the fluid.  If it's very watery, you're okay.  But if some of that thicker stuff comes out, then oh boy. 
[03:13:00]  Are you, you're telling me that you fucking had pre-cum come out when he tapped your fucking  prostate?  No, what happened was.  No, no, what happened was.  I completely came.  I shot a Johnny the Watt Holmes fucking load across the room.  I know everyone's going to spin this and I can't do anything about that.  But when I got the biopsy on the old prostate and it was like a rubber band sound and a snap,  fucking fluid went flying across the room.  Did it?  Were you a wreck?  Fucking yeah.  Were you a wreck? 
[03:13:30]  No, I wasn't a wreck.  And my biopsy was B-I dash opposite.  His name was Opsi.  How come everybody thinks I'm this guy, Peter Olofsky?  They keep calling me, hey, Peter.  They keep mixing me up with Peter Olofsky from down the street.  I thought your name was Aru.  Mr. Aru.  Stink.  Well, now they thought my name was Billy Om, because they kept calling me B-O-M. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Will you fucking back me up?  Not after that story.  Exactly.  It's a seminal fluid.  It's a seminal fluid.  Right.  Flood.  Flood.  Not the sperm.  It's in the prostate.  Sure.  Thank you.  The prostate makes that shit.  That shit.  Your testes only make the little bugs.  Dude, that shit shot out. 
[03:14:30]  Really?  And I'm too old for it to be shooting out like that.  Super soaker?  Holy shit.  Did it feel good?  Holy shit.  Did it feel like you were coming?  That's all right.  Or did it just like fucking came out?  No, I did all this material already.  It didn't feel good.  You can say it did.  No, no, no.  I don't even know.  The biggest fucking problem with it was I felt I got to shit and pee for the next eight  straight hours.  Yeah.  That uncomfortable I have to shit or pee feeling that sometimes you get?  Eight straight hours.  Nothing worse than that drive home where he hands you the tissues like a common whore  and you try to clean up, but you just want to get out of there so you don't do a good 
[03:15:00]  enough job and then you sit in the car seat and you feel a gush.  A gush.  A gush.  You just know how the whore feels when she drives home.  Yeah, that's how the whore feels.  I don't eat with whoremongers.  Leave my home.  Ah, yeah.  That was good.  It's great, right?  That was fucking...  I don't eat with whoremongers.  Yeah.  What fucking movie was that?  The Good Reverend Doctor.  The Good Reverend Doctor's going to be home soon.  Get out of here, Gator.  I'm sick, mama. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, he's fucking stealing shit.  I cried like a fucking baby.  Didn't he cry when you saw that?  Yeah, when he got killed.  No, I could give a shit.  Oh, that was good.  Nick can't wait until Monday.  Oh, Nick Cannon.  Nick Cannon can wait as long as you want.  But don't play it on Monday.  We were just talking about Opie's Cannon when he got his fucking prostate touched.  Don't play that on the 10 o'clock hour.  It's Nick Cannon.  Why would I play it on the 10 o'clock?  I got a tweet because it is fun.  Fun Friday.  Friday, fun.  It's fun.  Fun song. 
[03:16:00]  It's fun.  Friday, fun day.  And this guy, Mar Time.  A-M-A-R.  Oh, I know him.  You do?  No.  I'm on Twitter.  Hope you ever see the vid of the guy in Vietnam.  This will just wrap up our fun show.  Oh, sounds fun.  Vietnam.  Jesus.  Who got cut in half by a truck.  What?  And is trying to sit up with a group of people standing around.  This is not true.  How do we find it?  I don't want to see that.  There's no way this is on YouTube.  So how the fuck do we find this?  It's probably on one of those gore fucking sites. 
[03:16:30]  Go to bloodshows.com.  Not bloodshows.  I don't like that.  No.  It's fun, fun, fun.  All right.  Google video.  Partying, partying.  We're going to Google video.  No, I don't like it.  I'm not going to watch.  Why?  If the guy's trying to sit up and he doesn't have a lower half, that's hilarious.  Is he American or is he a North Vietnamese?  Is he VC?  I'll help you out.  It happened far away.  He drank paddy water.  No, it happened far away.  You're okay with this.  You could do this.  If it happened in Times Square,  you can't.  It's too close.  Yeah.  This happened far away.  And it was a long time ago.  Google video.  Vietnamese guy. 
[03:17:00]  Cut in half.  Accident.  Any man is holding his guts in.  Drink for my canteen.  And then he sees Lance and he lets the water just drip in the guy's face.  He could give a shit.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  This will wrap up Fun Friday.  I don't know if I want to see this.  Let me see it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, good.  This is, um, what happened?  What happened now?  You can't, you don't know how to work.  Sam?  The computer, yeah.  Sam does not know how to work.  You're going to press the button, Sam.  You're a bag of shit. 
[03:17:30]  Sam does not know how to work.  Oh, God.  Sam really doesn't know what he's doing over there.  Sam stinks on Google.  Party and party and party and party.  How do we blame E-Rock for this?  Yeah.  Because he stepped on one of the cords and just ruined it.  Holy shit.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Do you have to be to step on a cord and fuck it up?  Yes.  Oh, God.  I didn't mean that.  See, I played my hand.  Now everyone's going there and fucking up our...  Oh, God, no.  All right, here we go.  Turn it this way.  You're not the only one.  All right, so...  Vietnamese guy cut in half.  That's not Vietnam. 
[03:18:00]  That's fucking, uh...  That's the video I told you guys about.  That guy's...  That's a fucking traffic cop.  And he's Chinese, I heard.  Holy shit, he's still moving.  He's alive.  Yeah, he was fucking, uh...  Oh, I can't look at that.  He's completely cut in half.  He just moved...  Remember I told you...  He just lifted his arm up.  I can watch this, Jimmy.  He keeps trying to get to his guts.  He keeps trying to put his guts back in.  I can watch this.  And nobody touches him.  That's why I feel so bad, because no one...  He said gonna.  There's no way he survives this, right?  No, but look at how his body...  I just want to see him try to sit up.  He's dragged alongside of that.  I can't even fucking look at that. 
[03:18:30]  No.  He's pulling up his guts like he would your pants.  Oh, this poor guy.  Oh, God.  How horrible, man.  Why is it horrible?  I don't know, this fucker.  It's horrible, because to be in that position...  Is he talking to people?  Yeah, he's still...  Why isn't he bleeding more?  He's picking up his fucking gut.  Why isn't he bleeding more, Jimmy?  It must have squished everything.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Something's wrong.  He's trying to sit up a little bit.  You can't sit up.  You don't have any ass.  Oh, boy.  And he's looking to the right and seeing his fucking shoes and his legs. 
[03:19:00]  My shoes and legs.  Those are his fucking feet, right?  Oh, God.  All right.  Now I'm getting a little nauseous.  I'm getting nauseous.  He's looking to the right and seeing his feet.  I don't want to throw up.  I just got a little chill.  A little chill.  It's so horrible, man.  I'm getting like a cold sweat, and I'm feeling woozy.  Look at this poor guy, man.  I feel like if I don't know the language, it's not as bad.  That's terrible, dude.  I really...  Maybe music will make it better.  Play something fun.  Yeah, let's play something fun. 
[03:19:30]  And then...  Oh, that is fun.  Now we can watch it.  Maybe it is actually a fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We got...  Right foot, left foot.  Maybe it is Vietnam.  Yeah.  Look at him.  He keeps touching.  He keeps trying to pull his...  I have no ass for the front seat or back seat.  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  And he's laying right next to me.  And he has no cock for fun, either, at this point.  No cock for fun.  Look at him.  He's almost unbuttoning his stomach.  I know.  We're trying to keep it fun, Jimmy. 
[03:20:00]  We're trying to keep it fun.  Why is anybody holding this guy's hand?  That's what's so sad to me.  Hold my hand.  But it's like...  I'm cutting half, dude.  I'm cutting half, dude.  I'm cutting half, dude.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Did he live?  Oh, shit.  Why not?  Yeah.  Why not?  Oh, yeah.  Take him to one of those crack...  He's got a heart.  Those great fucking Vietnamese hospitals.  He's got a heart.  Wow, that guy just bent down to take a really good picture and walked away.  No, he's on the phone.  The guy's on the phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, dude, you can't believe what I'm looking at right now.  He's actually using a phone to call somebody.  Yeah, I'm sure that he is. 
[03:20:30]  The videotaping has got to be so creepy.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  I am not looking at that anymore.  Hey, remind me to show you.  I don't know how to say the fucking place.  But next week, I'll show you guys the fucking guy who was being murdered with a screwdriver.  That one almost made me throw up.  That one I had to...  I thought we saw that one.  Did we?  Yeah, I'm not watching that.  I almost fainted watching that.  I'm not watching.  Yeah, that one I can't watch.  I'm sure...  Crazy.  I'm sorry.  That shit be whack.  That shit be whack.  You cray-cray.  Listen, I'm leaving.  The show continues with Sam and the rest of the gang. 
[03:21:00]  They just kind of make shit up until Ronnie comes in and saves that hour.  And then Ronnie Fez at 11.  We leave you with David Lee Roth having gay sex, I think, right?  What?  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Enjoy your weekend, boys.  Oh, wait.  I'll be in Irvine next weekend at the Improv.  That's next weekend.  It's a shit.  But I still...  People buy tickets a week in advance for my shows.  Holla.  They like to get front row.  Yes.  Holla.  Get in the front row.  Bye-bye.  We leave you with this.  Now, I'll bet as you're sitting there, you're not only looking at my hard cock. 
[03:21:30]  Ain't got nobody waiting at home.  I'll bet you're a little bit hard yourself.  Oh, yeah.  We're both sitting here just stroking it, looking at these hot men.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I mean, you're hard, too.  Are you stroking it just like me?  God damn it, baby.  No, I ain't lying to you.  Ah, ah, yeah.  God, I wish it was your hand doing this.  Oh.  Oh.  Woo.  Even just sucking on it and just playing with my balls.  Woo. 
[03:22:00]  That would be so fantastic.  Oh, yes.  I live my life like there's no tomorrow.  There you go.  Put that nice, warm, moist mouth around there.  Oh, man.  Woo.  Let's just, let's both stroke ours right now.  You're stroking theirs here.  I'm only going to tell you one time.  Ah, yeah.  Let's both.  Let's see who can come first.  Yeah.  Let's see who can stroke it the hardest. 
[03:22:30]  Woo.  Let's see who can just blow that load.  First.  Oh, God.  Now, here we go.  Woo.  Oh, God.  Ah, yeah.  Now, just pretend that went right over your face.  Woo.  Start licking that cum right off my fingers.  Woo.  Doesn't that taste so, so good?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Sirius.
