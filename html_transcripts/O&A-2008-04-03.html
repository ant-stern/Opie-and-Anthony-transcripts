<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of their victory in the "Rochester Radio Madness" contest, where they relentlessly mocked contestant Terry Clifford's weight.  They bragged about their win, despite suspicions of vote rigging by "Insider Tony."  The hosts then transitioned to their ongoing feuds: one with Dennis and Callahan (Boston) and another stemming from a prank war with a Pennsylvania radio station. A bizarre news story about a horseradish-based fire alarm for the deaf provided fodder for further vulgar jokes.  The show heavily promoted their upcoming "O&A Animation Festival" at the Roseland Ballroom, detailing ticket information and prizes.  They also briefly commented on Mariah Carey's chart success, interspersed with their typical banter. A Pennsylvania listener called in to share their own attempts to antagonize Dennis and Callahan.

The broadcast then featured an in-studio interview with comedian Patrice O'Neal.  They discussed their upcoming "April craziness" promotional stunts, which they admitted were intentionally terrible.  They ridiculed the radio show *Scott and Todd*, mocking Scott's alleged plastic surgery and slurred speech, playing audio clips as evidence.  A significant portion focused on Jerry Seinfeld's Fiat accident, with the hosts speculating about his wealth and making numerous jokes, comparing the media's reaction to a hypothetical similar accident involving a Black celebrity.  They compared their comedic approach to *Scott and Todd's*, deeming their own superior.  The conversation then veered into offensive jokes about a news story regarding a pregnant transgender man, Thomas Beatty.

Further discussion with O'Neal covered Larry King's alleged outburst at his son's Little League game, leading to more vulgar jokes about King's age and marriages.  The hosts spent considerable time discussing a former producer, Rick, and his controversial *Steppin' Out* magazine interview, which they believed damaged relationships.  The segment concluded with more jokes about O'Neal's comedy and Anthony's physique.

O'Neal shared a childhood anecdote about the San Juan Capistrano Swallows Day Parade, highlighting the racist abuse suffered by a Compton dance troupe, the Soul Street Stompers.  They revisited Larry King's outburst, dissected more audio clips from *Scott and Todd*, criticizing their content and perceived host animosity, and offered opinions on various radio personalities.  A substantial portion involved analyzing images of overweight women from a website, with O'Neal expressing a preference for heavier women. This sparked a debate with another guest, Jim Jefferies, resulting in crude and offensive banter. Jefferies also recounted a story about a past relationship. The segment also included further discussion of *Scott and Todd*, speculation on the causes of AIDS, and plugs for O'Neal's stand-up shows.

A significant segment focused on male circumcision, debating its impact on HIV transmission.  The hosts expressed skepticism towards a recent study, relying on anecdotal evidence and personal experiences. A caller, Corinne from Jersey, dismissed the study.  The discussion delved into the foreskin's sensitivity and role in sexual experience, using vulgar language.  They touched upon alleged AIDS cures, mentioning Dr. Sebi and Magic Johnson. The conversation shifted to personal hygiene and the smell of uncircumcised penises, leading to tangents on other bodily functions and hygiene.  Jefferies actively participated, adding to the offensive humor. Listener calls contributed to the chaotic and vulgar nature of the conversation.  The hosts debated what constitutes "gay" behavior, discussing and categorizing sexual acts in a comedic and vulgar manner.  The segment concluded with further discussion of circumcision and related sexual topics, including a caller’s bizarre encounter with a dominatrix and a discussion of the film "Two Girls One Cup."

A caller’s anecdote about a girlfriend requesting oral sex while he was penetrating her sparked a lengthy, vulgar debate about self-fellatio versus masturbation, comparing them to different oral sex styles.  A brief call from David in Tennessee was followed by promotional announcements for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show, featuring Jefferies and O'Neal.  A listener's ("Gavin") submitted audio clip detailed a graphic account of anal sex, prompting further sexually explicit commentary.  The show then featured "What's Up, Eastside Dave's Box?", with Eastside Dave (Ron and Fez Show) in the studio, having an object hidden rectally.  The hosts and Jefferies guessed the object, leading to increasingly chaotic and vulgar exchanges.  Dave defecated in a garbage can, causing further pandemonium, including money exchanges, cleanup attempts, and Jefferies touching Dave’s genitals.  Dave ultimately licked his feces-covered fingers for money.  The show concluded with brief event plugs and a phone sex advertisement from Jim Norton.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to pet a deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want to pet a deer.  Brass knuckles.  Clack them with brass knuckles.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out. 
[00:01:00]  What does it smell like when one of them bust?  An old tackle box.  This is where entertainment is going.  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking spack.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is everyone ready to broadcast? 
[00:01:30]  I am in position to broadcast.  Good morning.  Are you ready to talk to America?  Yes.  Hello, America.  Good morning.  Wow, it's like right on the button where the alarms are going off.  People that got to get up at six.  And they're listening to this dribble.  Hi.  Hi.  Get up.  We had to get out of bed.  Don't hit that snooze. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  One of the greatest inventions ever, the snooze.  Oh, I thought you meant the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, well, of course.  I said one of.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  You got the O-N-A radio.com.  That has a lot of the things we talk about on the radio show.  Phones are already lit. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  I was listening to the replay yesterday, and I got to acknowledge something.  Boy, did Terry Clifford get a beating yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know if she deserved it.  Of course she did.  She did deserve it?  Oh, of course.  You can't walk around with a body like that.  Think people aren't going to just mock you.  For the people that weren't listening yesterday, we're in some kind of bracket competition.  Yeah, like March Madness College Basketball bracket. 
[00:03:00]  Or the one they did here in New York, March Bracket Brawl.  Bracket Brawl.  I wonder what brain trust came up with that name.  It's been in that conference room.  What do we call it?  Well, they're doing something called Radio Madness.  Rochester Radio Madness.  That sounds crazy.  So we're up against this show, the Coffee Club, I think.  Oh, the Morning Coffee Club. 
[00:03:30]  Coffee sounds like the drink, but it's spelled different.  Because it's not spelled like coffee.  Right.  So we found out yesterday that we're up against this show as part of Rochester Radio Madness.  So we figured, why not get to know our competition?  So like an unprovoked animal attack, we just decided to lay our fangs into this poor fatty.  Who's probably a wonderful person. 
[00:04:00]  No, I doubt it.  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  Oh, who would?  Who would want to know?  No, you just want to go after the easy target.  That, yeah.  It's just a mess.  I was listening to the replay and I was just laughing my ass off.  It was very funny.  Just the abuse this fat woman took from this program.  Unprovoked.  Just because she was put up against us with the rest of her radio team there and some silly bracket thing. 
[00:04:30]  We went after her both barrels.  Oh, boy, did we.  We need both barrels when you're hunting rhinoceros.  I don't even know why we started the show this way, but I just had to acknowledge how awful we were yesterday.  She did nothing.  It was just the accident of her birth.  Yeah, exactly.  She just wanted to be Terry.  Yeah.  Sometimes it just happens, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, just walking down the street and our hands are all pointed going, ha, fatso. 
[00:05:00]  Look at her.  Ha, ha.  Hey, Dom DeLuise.  What's the website again, E-Rock?  Rochesterinsider.com.  And then you'll find the link for the exciting radio contest.  Now, where did we start out yesterday?  What do you mean?  Against the coffee club, and where are we now as far as percentage-wise goes with the voting?  Well, I was reading the comments, and the guy that's running the whole thing is really, really mad 
[00:05:30]  because he noticed a huge spike in voting last night.  Well, what's the problem with that?  So now he's, like, filtering votes.  He wants to keep it as fair as possible.  How the hell did this happen?  Go down to the comments, E-Rock.  We're going to wreck your dumb contest.  Filtering votes.  Get out of here.  Oh, he's mad.  Go down to view the most current results.  Right here.  Hit here.  Okay.  Hit here.  No, hit.  Yeah, there's no link.  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, there is.  If you do what I say and hit here.  Oh, Jesus.  The word here.  Yeah, it was really close yesterday.  Now we're beating the morning coffee club 74.3% to 25.7%.  Oh.  Okay.  Go down.  And find the comments.  I don't know if it's...  No, where the hell were the comments?  Go back.  I'm sure people were commenting on Terry.  Was it on the blog?  Yeah, maybe the blog.  Were they commenting on Terry?  No, no, no.  Oh, I thought you meant some of our fans might have been able to comment. 
[00:06:30]  No, basically the guy that put the whole thing...  Okay, here we go.  Back on track.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, yeah, haters in the house.  Oh.  Some people have nothing better to do than cheat at an online voting contest for local radio shows.  Wow.  Such haters, man.  And as many of you know that have been following our Radio Madness tournament, uh, might have 
[00:07:00]  already noticed the voting percentages did change drastically overnight.  Oh.  Cheating.  I'm not cheating.  I just want to acknowledge that I love the pests of this radio show.  And we're not doing this for the glory of winning some dumb Rochester radio contest.  We're doing this just to be annoying to everybody.  Just to ruin their little thing.  Right.  That's what we do.  He continues.  That's because we noticed that there was some vote stacking going on. 
[00:07:30]  Apparently there are some people out there that are so desperate to see certain results,  they've resorted to desperate measures.  What?  This ain't Florida, people.  Oh, I get it.  Such losers.  But it doesn't matter.  We're on to them.  What you see now is an accurate accounting of votes.  And hopefully it'll stay that way as we continue to fish out those who are intent on being corrupt.  Corrupt.  This guy's just going to make the pests try a little harder.  That's all.  Is he insulting this show or the fans?  Or both? 
[00:08:00]  I think both.  Who is this jerk?  I'm going to, his name is, uh, Troy.  No matter what it takes, Insider is committed to making sure the true, most popular radio shows  wind up winning.  Well, now, if they get on and say, hey, we're up against, uh, Opie and Anthony,  and they're, uh, douches, and, uh, could you please vote for us, uh, then their listeners  would vote.  And you would truly see who the most popular, uh, show is.  Where is this voting supposed to be coming from? 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  Just people that stumble upon the site?  I guess.  Sure.  Well, I, we, and that, our show he's talking about, though.  It has to be because.  Oh, yes.  Because yesterday, the, um, the count was, like, 55% to 45%, and now it's 75% or something  like that.  Yeah, yeah.  To 25%.  Go back, you're up.  I think he's upset.  And then he, he, uh, finishes by saying, so keep voting, and hopefully those haters  with too much time on their hands will get the message.  And then he signs it, Insider Tony. 
[00:09:00]  Eh, shut up, Insider.  Uh, Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy.  Insider Troy.  Troy.  Is there an email link for Troy?  Yeah.  They'll find it on their own, Jimmy.  Yeah, they'll get him.  They'll find it on their own.  Oh, boy.  Oh, they're so stupid.  I swear, it's always like the scene in The Godfather, where somebody just cracks and goes,  look, I don't care how many you guinea greaseball wops come out of the woodwork, and then he's  just sitting there watching going, oh, oh, don't do that.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, you know how this is going to end.  And Troy's going to be laying there with a, getting a back massage, and a bullet's going  to go through his glasses.  Oh, Troy, uh, all right, Troy's going to be voting for Obama, it looks like.  Huh?  Wait, he looks like Urkel?  Yeah.  He has a little Urkel to him.  Oh, is that why you're using the term haters?  Or haters.  Yeah.  Yo, playa.  Yo, kid!  Yo.  So we got that going on in Rochester. 
[00:10:00]  We got something else going on in Boston.  Let's say hi.  Well, he likes Terry's ass, too, then.  Oh, yeah.  He's the only white chick with an ass that he can look at.  And then he realized it was, like, just the side of her stomach.  Let's, uh, let's say hi to DJ in Pennsylvania.  DJ.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  What's up, Jimmy?  What's up, sir?  Hey, I just wanted to call and let you know, uh, WEI is getting really pissed.  The phone screeners at night, uh, was yelling at me last night because, uh, we kept calling. 
[00:10:30]  At night.  All right, sir, we're going to point you out.  Have a good day.  I think it is.  Ah, that's another great little battle front that we got going.  Does anyone else understand the beauty that we just took a call from some dude in Pennsylvania  that's helping us with a war in Boston?  In Boston.  And he's calling at night just because he can.  The call screener at night at that station, honestly, has nothing to do.  He should be happy that he's getting all these phone calls.  Nothing to do, though, with what happened with, with, uh, that idiot, uh, making comments 
[00:11:00]  about this program.  Dennis and Callahan.  Yeah.  They, well, they wondered where we went after doing our dumb April Fool's Day prank 10 years  ago.  What do they say?  We're working at McDonald's or something.  Or, or we're pedos or something.  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  Completely making fun, uh, basically saying that, uh, we've never been seen from again.  Yeah.  Even though we're broadcasting in the same city they're from.  Yeah.  So we, uh, had the, the pest get on it and remind these people what, what we are doing. 
[00:11:30]  And, uh, the screener at night, who, like I said, just had nothing to do with this whole  thing, has to take the brunt.  You hear the happiness in that guy's voice?  Oh, he was so happy.  Just want to let you know I did my part, guys.  Did my part.  I really pissed him off.  It was great.  A lot of fun.  He was mad.  Mission accomplished.  Mission accomplished, sir.  All right.  What else is going on? 
[00:12:00]  Everyone have a good night?  Jimmy, anything?  No, I'm okay.  I'm just reading about, uh, I was reading Dr. Cuck, who's, uh, theory about how time  travel is going to be possible and likely.  And people in England are, like, up in arms.  It's like front page news all over London.  Why are they up in arms?  What is with England?  When I say up in arms, I shouldn't say that.  They're not protesting, but I think it's getting a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, making a big  splash.  Dr. Cuck, who, he, he shouldn't have said that.  That time travel's going to be possible. 
[00:12:30]  How would we get wasabi for our sushi?  In the future, will we eat sushi?  Stay tuned.  Why don't you guys have that clip in front of me every day?  We'll find out.  That dope with his stupid English, uh, news guy accent.  Yeah.  Sushi, the powerful wasabi.  To put on your sushi.  It's just a dumb little thing, but, uh, here it is. 
[00:13:00]  It's the horseradish, you're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste  wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  With sushi.  Sushi.  Did you hear this story, Jimmy?  You were here, right?  And then, what do they want to do?  They want to invent the horseradish fire, we gotta play the whole thing.  A horseradish fire alarm.  It'll be great.  A horse, horse, wait, a horseradish fire alarm.  It's for deaf people, and when there's a fire in the house, 
[00:13:30]  because apparently deaf people's, uh, skin doesn't feel heat.  So they wanted to smell horseradish, because that's what wakes up a deaf person.  Yeah.  How about they invent a wall of pins?  And if there's heat in the room, the pins come flying forward and wake up.  Just smack some, ow!  Oh!  And wake up deaf-o.  How about you get a friend with ears?  Who can stay with you?  Just hire a guy to sit in a chair all night.  Some little thing that just comes out and pokes you in your useless eardrum from your pillow. 
[00:14:00]  Something else really useless, like the stick shit from an Edsel.  Just put that in your wall.  This is horseradish.  You're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  And this is a new design of fire alarm.  Inside these cans, the smell of the horseradish has been extracted and carefully stored. 
[00:14:30]  Inside these cans, nothing is happening, and it's the guy's ears.  Perfect for putting mints and candies when people come over, lay on your side, and let  people eat chips out of it.  I can't do the voice, so you get the point.  Of course you can.  Close enough.  Yeah.  We heard the story, and within eight seconds, Anthony had the guy right there.  Oh, I know.  His stupid accent.  And carefully stored. 
[00:15:00]  In Japan, scientists have been putting the new alarm to the test.  Having allowed the subject to slip into a deep sleep, a button is pressed, the alarm triggered,  and horseradish pumped into the bedroom.  This man, like almost all of those taking part in the test, woke up inside two minutes.  Once the lights are back on, he explains that the smell reminded him of times when he'd swallowed 
[00:15:30]  too much horseradish by accident while eating sushi.  The scientist conducting the tests says he's excited at the invention's potential to save  the life of those with hearing disabilities.  With tests continuing, the makers of the horseradish alarm are hoping to have it on the market  within the next two years.  God, wouldn't you just come up with an alarm that shakes the bed?  Yeah.  Just shakes the bed. 
[00:16:00]  That's all you need.  Like it's an earthquake or something?  Uh-huh.  Or sprinkles water on you?  Yeah, spraying horseradish smell into your room.  Yeah, that's the dumbest idea.  That's like idea 8,000 on how to wake up people that are hard of hearing during a fire.  Yeah.  That's horseradish.  All right, we're just getting started.  Warming up here.  Uh, we got like a Jim Norton wannabe down there in Philadelphia.  What?  Uh, seeking a photo with Obama. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, this guy was a little persistent.  Classic story.  We'll get to it right after the break.  What a dushy.  Also, can we get Sam in here?  We might leave Terry Clifford alone today.  No.  I want Sam.  She's a bully.  She really is a bully.  She's a bully.  She's a problem.  She's a cowie.  Uh, I want more audio of Scott, from Scott and Todd.  Okay.  We haven't done that justice yet. 
[00:17:00]  Something is going on with that guy's voice.  We're cheek.  And we got to exploit it to the fullest, because that's what we do.  Yeah, we pick on people.  We pick on the easy targets.  Pick, pick, pick.  Someone's got to keep track to see how many people we pick on today.  First of all, we picked on a fatty that's just trying to survive in radio in Rochester.  Yeah.  We picked on the deaf.  Yeah.  We picked on the English.  The English.  They're way over there.  Stupid. 
[00:17:30]  And now we're picking on, quote, a radio legend, because he's talking a little funny these days.  Very funny.  Sounds ridiculous.  Yeah, he doesn't sound like himself anymore.  Could you get some of that audio?  Easily.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  Hey, really fast.  Before the first break, very, very excited.  We're doing the first, and I'm going to call it the first annual.  I think this could be an event we do every year.  The first annual O&A Animation Festival.  You guys signed for this or what?  I'm very excited about this.  I was online last night looking at some of the animations from the last animation contest, 
[00:18:00]  and then just ones that people have made.  And some I've seen, some I hadn't, but every one of them just laughing my ass off.  Some of them are done so well, and the clips from the show they picked were perfect.  The animation, really funny.  I just saw the one, my blackjack tips, and it's the animation of me giving advice on blackjack,  and I just come off like a complete lunatic.  The animation's great.  Yeah.  There's some really funny ones out there.  Just talented people looking forward to getting into a venue with a live audience like this 
[00:18:30]  and just having a great time with these animations.  Yeah, we played a lot of these animations during our O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour last summer,  and the reaction was unbelievable.  And we didn't even have a contest.  Most of these animations just came in over the last couple of years.  People just trying to help out the radio show.  A lot of them you can see on onaradio.com.  There's a bunch of other ones on the website we can't promote that is named after this radio show. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, figure it out.  But anyway, here it is.  The first annual O&A Animation Festival.  It's going to happen Thursday, June 5th at the Roseland Ballroom.  Nice.  Here in New York City.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Tomorrow tickets will go on sale, and I think these tickets are going to go really, really fast.  8 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  We tried to do a free event, but we just couldn't get that done.  But we got a nice cheap ticket for everybody.  Tickets will be $10 each, plus a service charge.  We have nothing to do with that, but I think that's going to be another $2 or something.  $2 or $3.  $2.  Of course, featuring top animations submitted by the fans. 
[00:19:30]  We got cash prizes.  Thousands for first, second, and third.  Now I'm hearing that the cash could be up to as high as $10,000.  Okay, that's pretty good.  That is really, really good.  Also, we're going to throw two live comedians in there to just mix it up a little bit.  And it's going to be a night of partying, hanging out. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  It'll be a good time.  I think it's going to be a great time.  Details, examples, and audio clips on our website that we can promote.  And onaradio.com.  Here's the deal, guys.  There's a lot of animators listening to us right now.  Actually, if a few of you guys are working on something, I would love to know what you're working on.  Because we don't know what's going on yet with the listeners and the animations.  You've got to send your animations in through the regular mail.  Because we want a nice high-res copy of these things.  So when we show them on the big screen at the Roseland Ballroom, we'll get a nice copy there. 
[00:20:30]  Put it on a disc and send it in.  Send them to Opie and Anthony Animation Contest, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  And I believe all this info is up on onaradio.com.  But the headline today, tickets go on sale tomorrow through Ticketmaster for the ONA Animation Festival Thursday, June 5th at the Roseland Ballroom.  That's great, man.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:00]  Mariah Carey now has the second most number one single. 
[00:21:30]  That's um...  She just surpassed...  Surpassed.  She just passed Elvis Presley.  Wow.  Yeah, wow.  The most number one singles.  And she's just going to beat the Beatles.  There's two behind the Beatles.  Unless they put out something new.  They better work on that.  I don't think so.  Or unless everything she does is like a rendition of Happy Birthday to You and no one likes it.  How unbelievable is that?  The Mariah Carey?  You would think Madonna would have more number one singles than Mariah Carey. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Who else?  Just an odd person.  Maybe Celine Dion.  Yeah.  You know...  We don't really live in that world.  What?  Kiss.  Kiss.  You know, you kind of know that Mariah Carey had a career going for herself years ago.  Mm-hmm.  She was huge, you know.  But recently...  She never went away, man.  Mm-hmm.  I think this is the first number one single in three years. 
[00:22:30]  But for the most part, she's had a number one almost every year.  She's got a number one single out.  Almost.  What song?  I don't even know what song is.  I've heard of it.  The song is called...  Sure, E-Rock knows the name.  I was in the paper.  What are some of her big songs?  I don't know anything except for...  Vision of Love, you might remember.  That's the only one I remember.  It's terrible, too.  Oh, Jimmy, the pressure's on.  I just know the one where she squeaks really high.  Oh, yeah, where she jumps on the plates barefoot.  Oh, that's her personal life. 
[00:23:00]  Psycho.  Lunatic.  Hey, she went to my high school.  Yes, she did.  That's what keeps Opie from being the most famous person from Harborfield.  I think I'm the most famous person out of John Glenn High School.  Out there in Elwood.  But, um...  I'm the second most famous.  You're the second most famous.  From Harborfield High School.  But...  Yeah.  There's a big...  There's a big...  Big drop-off there.  Oh, wow, it's there.  I'm not even going to try to, like, play that game.  She's two behind the Beatles, and you're going, attack Denison Callahan. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old graph takes a big dip down.  I don't know who else graduated Harborfield High School that got famous or whatever.  But Mariah Carey used to hang out with my twin brothers.  No, Boomer didn't go to John Glenn.  Didn't John Glenn go there?  No.  A song.  They named it after him.  And then, uh, when they named it after him, he wouldn't even come to the school to, you  know, say, like, thanks or do, like, this, uh, whatever ceremony that they do when they 
[00:24:00]  name a school after you.  Really?  They asked him to come there, and this bastard wouldn't come to the school.  I said, hell no.  No.  Screw yous.  Go F yourself.  Yeah.  Uh, Touch My Body is the new number one from Mariah Carey.  Can we hear a bit of it?  I don't know what it's called.  Why would we want to hear that, Jimmy?  I'm just curious if I've heard it.  I don't know it.  I don't know either.  Yeah.  What stations are playing that, like your, uh, what, your pop stations?  Your, your kiss stations. 
[00:24:30]  Your kiss type stations.  Yeah, there's a kiss station in every city in America, so I'm sure they're playing them.  You got it there, E-Rock?  This is called what?  Touch My Body?  Oh, okay.  I have no idea what this is.  I hate this.  Huh?  I hate this.  I love the garlic butter song.  Yeah.  This is a number one song? 
[00:25:00]  When the hell did this happen?  Well, very recently.  Oh.  Oh.  Who's listening to this, though?  I, I, I don't.  I will hunt you down.  Cause, baby, I'm hoping my best.  Teenage girls?  Oh, maybe I ought to, maybe I ought to brush up on some of this music.  Who's blasting out of my Escalade?  You dated up on them, old man. 
[00:25:30]  It's, uh.  Now, who else is listening to this?  Who?  The XPD of this fine radio station here in New York City.  Ah, okay.  Tracy's very good friends with Mariah.  They travel together.  Yeah.  How about that?  Are, are we done with this?  Yeah.  Please.  I hadn't heard it.  This is very monotonous, rambling.  It doesn't really have a good musical sound to it.  It's, it's no Gwen Stefani, right, Ed? 
[00:26:00]  Well, I, I'll give Gwen her props.  Hey, Ed!  Well, you know, at least Gwen's songs are a little catchy.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Shut up!  I love that.  One of the most humiliating moments of my life.  Of course.  That's why I love it.  Why, why was that humiliating again?  I forgot.  That was this, that was a reenactment of when I was in high school. 
[00:26:30]  And, and, and some, I was like a sophomore in high school and there was a bunch of seniors  in the class.  Yeah.  And, uh, someone walked by the classroom on the outside and they were singing some dumb  song in the, in the, in the, I don't remember what they were singing, but it was dead silent  in the classroom.  And I was going to sing back, shut the F up.  Right.  And had I done that, it would have gotten an 11.  Of course.  It would have slaughtered.  Yeah.  But I backed out at the last minute and I went, shut up! 
[00:27:00]  You didn't want to, uh, really commit.  Yeah.  And use the F word.  And it got, the hair on my neck just tingled with humiliation.  I felt everyone's eyes going, not even hating me, just going, oh, you nobody, shut up.  Quiet, unfunny boy.  All right.  Embarrassing.  Oh, man.  We have an announcement to make.  Hmm?  Here it is.  It's April craziness. 
[00:27:30]  April craziness.  Oh, no.  It's so crazy.  Crazy.  April craziness.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, apparently it's April craziness.  Yeah.  Now, uh, you all know March Madness.  Yeah.  So we decided to come up with April craziness.  Uh, and not because, uh, everybody else did a March Madness thing, but because we were way  too lazy and again missing the proverbial boat on everything, this show is just a prime example 
[00:28:00]  of a day late and a dollar short.  So, uh, instead of some kind of March Madness, why not April craziness?  That's right.  Hold on.  Let me, let me really make it crazy.  All right.  That's crazy.  April craziness.  You know how you said we're behind and all that just now?  Oh, yeah.  Always.  This is the beauty of April craziness?  Yeah.  It's April craziness. 
[00:28:30]  Crazy.  April craziness.  Oh, no.  It's so crazy.  Crazy.  April craziness.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  The beauty of April craziness?  Yeah.  We don't know what that means yet.  Yeah.  We're not quite sure.  We're still working some of the kinks out.  It's April 3rd.  And we decided to do April craziness.  You would think it would be all worked out.  Yeah.  We probably, you would think maybe we have crazy things planned for the whole month of April. 
[00:29:00]  We don't really know what it means yet.  Not really.  We really don't know what it means.  We're working on some concepts and hopefully by the 10th of April, we'll let you know.  But there will be a bracket event.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, yeah.  I think, I'm, I'm feeling we need something like that.  All right.  Because it's, that's the whole March madness thing.  If we do April craziness, we need a bracketed event.  But I think it should be all encompassing.  We could do a bracket event, but we have to do more craziness. 
[00:29:30]  It's got to be even crazier.  Yeah, we have to have a lot of crazy stuff going on.  Is craziness crazier than madness?  Like more insane?  I'd rather be mad than crazy.  Yeah, see?  Because March madness.  I don't know.  Yes, then.  We could make it April lunacy.  No.  Well, we already got the, we already got the little promo thing made.  It's official.  I mean, we just played it.  I know.  We played it.  We can't take that back.  No, of course not. 
[00:30:00]  It confuses people.  Not only will April craziness have brackets, but there will be regions and seeds.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Are they working hard on this?  Are we going to start April craziness today?  No, I'm not saying you are.  I'm asking.  Are they working hard on it?  Are we starting it today?  Absolutely.  All right.  We're going to start April craziness today.  Later on in the program.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So one of the big stories today, we've got a man who's down there in Philly.  And he tried to seek a photo with Obama. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really wanted a picture bad.  This reminded me of Jimmy also.  I think everybody that knows Jimmy read this story and went, oh, this guy's just a pain  in the ass with pictures, much like our own Jimmy.  But I'm very polite.  Yeah.  But you're persistent.  Not what Obama wouldn't be.  No.  Not with Secret Service protection.  That Secret Service does scare the crap out of everybody.  Except this guy, because he kept going and going and going, trying to get a picture  with Obama.  They kind of ushered him away a little bit, but didn't pounce on him and drag him off. 
[00:31:00]  Where were they?  In Philly.  I don't know about me.  Oh, some restaurant.  He was doing one of those things where he goes into a restaurant and acts like he's trying  to be a regular guy.  You know what politicians do that?  Probably eating a Philly cheesesteak.  Yeah.  Hey, look at me.  Photo op.  So the guy wanted a picture with Obama.  Yeah.  Did Barack even...  Oh, there it is right there.  Why is she talking?  Yeah.  This is the bit right here.  Yeah.  It's on the news today all over the place.  You just see him walking around and...  And the guy just kept following him and... 
[00:31:30]  Like, I want a picture.  I kept asking him for the picture.  That guy right there.  Look at him.  This keeps following him.  What's his name?  He looks very Italian.  So...  I think we got the audio of that.  Was he like, hey, why won't the moolie take a picture with me?  Some Philly Italian guy.  Yeah.  Here's the audio, I believe.  Yeah.  Sir, will you stop...  Will you stop...  Will you stop...  Look, you're an eBay guy. 
[00:32:00]  I just want a photograph.  I just want a photograph.  I'm not looking for anything inside anything.  It'll take you two seconds.  Get it up.  I mean, that's...  Hi, press.  You're going into the...  I'm going into the right.  Where are you doing?  Into the right.  Into the right, press.  Into the right.  Sarah, can I get a quick picture with you?  Please?  I love you.  You are wearing me out, brother.  I got one with Hillary and I got one with Hillary.  Come on.  Let's not go.  Thank you.  Please, one quick one. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, Senator.  No, you know what?  No.  Can I just say something to you real fast?  Yeah, I think you can.  Because the...  I'm not going with Senator Clinton.  I'm sure you do.  I'm not going with Senator McCain.  Why don't you just take a picture with me?  Because when I was trying to talk to some kids, and I know...  Look, I...  No, my wife's a school teacher.  My wife's a teacher.  And I also know...  She was there.  Okay?  My wife was there, but she had to go walk.  I mean, that was a...  Why don't you just take a picture with me?  I'm not asking for an autograph.  It's not...  It's for my family.  Appreciate it.  Well, whatever.  You know what?  You know what? 
[00:33:00]  Just take it.  Just take it to me.  I won't be smiling because...  That's okay.  Because you've been wearing me out.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Because...  Thank you.  Thank you.  You've been rude about this.  No, let's not genie out, Senator.  You got it in the bottle.  Take a picture.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Right.  Take it going.  Just because you've been rude about it.  Go ahead.  No, I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm done.  All I want is a picture with him.  That was it.  Wait a minute.  Oh, man. 
[00:33:30]  I was going to give props to Obama.  I'm like, good for Obama not taking the picture with the guy.  But in the end, he took the picture with the guy.  Can I tell you how stupid Obama is with the cameras rolling to do that?  With cameras rolling...  But the guy sounds like a complete ass.  He is a complete ass.  But when the camera's rolling, why do you think they pick up babies during campaigns?  Think they like those things?  It's just stupid.  Smile.  Get it all...  Take the stupid picture.  The guy's gone.  It doesn't make any drama.  I like how he turned all black on his ass for a second there.  He goes, hey, you're wearing me out, brother. 
[00:34:00]  Yo, brother.  You're wearing me out.  What's the matter?  What's wrong, Patrice?  As we're joined by Patrice O'Neal, our black correspondent.  Good morning.  Good morning, Patrice O'Neal.  Always a pleasure.  Did you see the thing?  He's awful.  Yeah.  You saw it.  Awful.  Yeah.  Not just hear it.  Did you see it?  Saw it.  All right, ready?  The guy is awful.  That's trying to get a picture.  This is what bothers me.  What do you think the black view on this is?  That guy that wanted a picture is a complete ass and should have been tackled by Secret Service. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you very much.  Where are the dudes that make this guy disappear?  He's not president yet.  But he's a dude running for president and the guy walked right up on him.  I mean, no one gets to the under the, like you said, he should have just took the picture.  The dude was up on him close enough to have an argument with him.  Yeah.  What dude running for president, what president, what senator, what governor goes, dude, you're wearing me out. 
[00:35:00]  That's the type of change that Obama wants.  Don't even say, black dude.  Why isn't the black dude that has a really good chance of becoming the president of the United States, why doesn't he have better protection at this point?  Thank you.  Let some white guy come up on him like that.  Did you see it?  It's right there.  The guy is up in his face annoying him.  When do you get a chance to annoy anybody in government? 
[00:35:30]  Obama could have just looked around and given a wink to one guy and that guy would have been taken out of the picture.  See, I watched it ten times.  My head started hurting.  It's just like, you know, you got to work with white people.  You know, you guys are white.  So you got to come in and go, hi, white people.  And then you see that.  And you go, and you go, you know, they don't care.  His secret service was looking around like, like, like they were outside of a club, like going, should we or should we not?  This dude was up in his face. 
[00:36:00]  I'm talking about touching him, calling him a, you know, hey, dude, let me take a picture and gets him to the point where he has to go, man.  All right, I'll take the picture, but you're wearing me out.  You're wearing me out, brother.  Yeah, you were.  And it was a white dude.  Yeah.  Ass.  Yeah.  How do you get that close to Obama?  Shouldn't be able to.  I think at some point.  He could have killed him with one of those homemade prison knives.  Yeah, a little shank.  He could have gotten him.  He was close enough to do some damage.  He really did get close to him. 
[00:36:30]  I think Obama at some point is going to need to get Farrakhan's people, the little red bow tie people around him.  If you don't think I was going, boy, I hope he can stay alive until he becomes president and makes a change that my security would be.  I'm amazed he doesn't have it figured out yet at this point to have better security around him.  I mean, you know, get the rap guys involved.  Get some of those rap security guys.  If you do, he won't win, though.  That'll be the thing.  Get Mayweather's guys.  Mayweather came in here with a possibility.  No, then he won't be president.  You're right.  Because people will be like, ah, look who he is. 
[00:37:00]  He has the most protected guy.  He's got the highest secret service.  Does he really?  Yeah, he really does.  He has the most secret service, bro.  Against who?  Against everyone.  He has the most secret service.  Kittens?  Because this dude was right in his face, Norton.  It's so secret, the secret service, that they don't even come out.  Kenny makes sure you're safe or on the road.  When you're in Seattle, Kenny makes sure no one gets next to you.  Because we have 500 of that guy in the room.  Obama has one.  We have 100.  That's every one of our fans.  Remember traveling virus, Patrice?  Dude. 
[00:37:30]  I forgot.  I forgot about the dude that got on stage when I was on.  I wasn't really feeling threatened.  Kenny, that dude had disappeared in a puff of smoke.  He went away.  I thought he went back into his genie bottle.  Kenny had made that guy disappear, and I'm just doing my hacky five minutes.  Hey, you saw it from the stage.  He removed him from the stage, but then we saw he, from the backstage part to the door,  that guy was removed like it was a cartoon.  Dude, and I said to Kenny, I was getting ready to go, you know, nah, Kenny. 
[00:38:00]  And then I was going to go, nah, Kenny, you know, he's cool.  Then I go, you know what?  That was magnificent.  Yeah.  I want that.  Because this dude could have been dangerous.  You know what?  Good.  He went from the stage to the sidewalk with a mere few seconds.  Seconds.  Yeah, a few seconds.  I've never seen that.  It was unbelievable.  He got thrown down the stairs, which was hysterically funny.  And his feet never touched the ground.  Nope.  He was outside the venue.  No.  Wow.  That was really impressive, Kenny.  It's on YouTube if anybody wants to revisit that. 
[00:38:30]  Is that one really on YouTube?  The guy getting chased?  Kicked out of the venue?  Thrown down the stairs.  I think he came to shake my hand or touch me.  It was something, but Kenny had, I felt good.  Yeah.  But that Obama thing, dude, you, I mean.  Handle it one way or the other.  That was horrid, man.  Handle it one way or the other.  Take the picture and let the guy go away or tackle him and pummel him.  But don't handle it like leaving Obama hanging out to dry with the guy.  For people to judge what he should.  Like Norton's rant.  What he should and shouldn't. 
[00:39:00]  He should never get to the point where he had to make a mistake.  It should have been somebody dragging that dude down the street.  Well, that's not going to happen again.  You know, they'll, nah.  Somebody got to get fired.  Yeah, they can't let that happen again.  Because if he's making an impromptu stop like that or just doing something in public, it's hard to get people just out of there when they're not doing anything.  You can't just, because you got cameras there, it's hard to just tackle a dude who's not threatening.  It won't be his fault, though.  It'll be like, ah, hey, man.  He could have been like, hey, easy on that gentleman. 
[00:39:30]  Easy.  As they just beat the crap out of him.  And he sneaks, there's protocol for that.  Right.  I've seen pictures of somebody getting close to the president, even not getting shot, and the Secret Service grabbed the president by his buttcheeks, by his nape and his pants, and run the president away from the situation.  You also don't want to seem paranoid doing that, though.  That's another thing.  He should seem paranoid.  You don't want to seem paranoid.  Like, if people get close to you, that even looks worse if all your guys are on camera just dragging somebody off. 
[00:40:00]  He's the black presidential candidate, right, who could win, and funky Philly, with a Philly dude up in his face, bugging him.  Yeah.  That dude should have got his ass beat.  Obama can't win.  It's on the front page of the paper today.  Hillary Clinton says that Obama cannot win.  Really?  Is she making more bowling jokes?  She stinks.  Well, no offense, but I mean, I like Obama.  Yeah, Hillary was very hacky to do the April Fool's prank, saying that she wants to, like, settle this thing with a bowling thing. 
[00:40:30]  But your boy, and my boy, I want Obama, too.  37.  He bowls a 37 in seven frames.  Niggas don't bowl.  What are you, judging him by white people's sports?  Are you, jackass?  All right, this is the point I'm going to make, though.  We made it yesterday.  All right, if you're a bad bowler, why would you bowl then?  He's trying to relate to these ridiculous crackers, and at the same time, bowling stinks.  It's something you go, I can bowl. 
[00:41:00]  He's a black dude.  You know Obama goes, if these crackers can do it, I can do it.  I can bowl.  And he couldn't bowl.  But you know what?  He did it with such a non-rhythm that he almost looked white.  Really?  It should make him, people should come closer to Obama because he's stunk.  I think he was endearing to some white people because he was bad at bowling.  No, I disagree.  You want to feel like he's part of the white community and that he bowls, but you don't  want him on weekends.  What if Hillary was taking foul shots?  And she just was missing. 
[00:41:30]  Would that harm her presidency?  She has to kick up her heel every time she shoots.  Kick up that right heel.  And you see, that's what Clinton, black people love Clinton because he went on Arsenio and  played the trombone or whatever he played.  Yeah, he played the sax.  He played the sax.  He's like, oh, he's a brother.  Look at him.  So you know Obama has to do, as a matter of fact, you know he has campaign people that  say, you know, you need to get closer to your more rural people.  You're going to be bowling.  And he's like, bowling?  And here's their activities. 
[00:42:00]  They play bingo.  He had a choice.  Bingo.  Bingo.  Bowling.  Because all white people do bingo.  Hunting.  Hunting.  Sport fishing.  Fox hunting.  Fox hunting.  A question.  He's going to be fox hunting.  He chose bowling because he had all those other things.  Dude, a 37 in seven frames.  And how many balls is that?  You couldn't bowl a 37 in seven frames if you tried to bowl that bit.  Oh.  And he looked embarrassed.  I mean, he really did.  He went, golly gee, hey, I'm not here to bowl. 
[00:42:30]  Did anyone see his form?  How did he throw the ball with two hands?  That's what I'm saying.  Like, did he have to bend down like the little kids do and, like, roll it with two hands?  He had to use that handicapped kid rack?  Yeah.  The thing you bring out that aims the ball for you?  The bumpers.  He was like Shaquille on the other foul line.  Good form.  But it just wasn't going in.  It just was going right to the gutter, man.  Yeah, it was embarrassing.  But really fast.  So, Obama can't win is the headline on our paper today.  Hillary made this claim to, I think, Bill Richardson. 
[00:43:00]  Richardson, right?  Yeah, good luck.  Because, you know, she started to realize that Bill Richardson was going to back Obama.  And she's pleading with the guy going, look, he can't win this thing.  Why are you doing this?  What is she looking at?  Because the guy's got a pretty good chance.  He's pulling away in the polls.  Now, the latest is that he's going to give Al Gore a big position if he becomes president.  Or he's going to offer him something nice.  Could it be vice president?  Your people are doing a good job at laying down things to make white people nervous, man. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  All y'all are doing.  We're trying, bro.  Oh.  Let me tell you.  Reverend Wright, this bowling thing.  Reverend Wright, Reverend Wright.  Don't blame Whitey for that one.  This guy's a militant standing up in front of his parishioners blurting out propaganda and crap.  It's not propaganda and crap.  And Obama's sitting in the church smiling to this guy.  I've heard white people.  I've heard.  First of all, he's been a preacher.  I know you talked about it already, but he's been a preacher for 20 years.  They took his rants, his civil rights rants, which he never said, attack white people, burn 
[00:44:00]  them.  He said the white people started AIDS.  Yeah.  To hurt people of color.  Yeah.  What was wrong with that?  We tried to keep it under our hats.  Like, I don't know.  What did he say wrong?  It's just silly.  And when he says white people, it's just...  We're never going to get along, though.  Let me ask you something, Norris.  We like you.  We're just never going to get along.  Why are we even trying?  Let me ask you, man.  What's wrong with that?  You realize, you realize that every time that a black person says white people, I'm praying 
[00:44:30]  to you, Norris, right now, to your consciousness.  When we say white people, we do not mean you.  I didn't take it personally.  We don't mean you.  White people is our euphemism for the country, for the secret white man.  It doesn't exist.  We also have a word that we use that doesn't necessarily mean you.  Okay?  But you say it directly to me. 
[00:45:00]  I don't look at you and go, Anthony, you know you invented AIDS.  We go, the government is like the white guy.  Like, the American KKK is the man.  It's just the man.  That's it, man.  It's like, I know police officers personally, like, what's up, Kenny?  Or what's up, Eric?  Dudes that I know, right?  But in uniform, they're not...  He's not Kenny, unless I know him.  But he's just some stormtrooper that I don't see his face.  I look at them as great protectors of society. 
[00:45:30]  He can have a mask on.  And that's what it is.  You just...  Once you're in that cop uniform, dude, you just...  You're a white guy.  You're something else.  You know what I'm saying?  Don't you understand they're there to serve and protect you?  I understand that, because I own property now.  Exactly.  So I understand that.  But growing up, you don't understand it.  They're like...  If you live in the hood, police are like aliens who are driving through kidnapping people.  Like, I've seen guys just get dragged into an unmarked car and driven away. 
[00:46:00]  On their way to school, I'm sure.  Right?  On their way to college.  Yes!  Get out of here.  All the time.  They're slinging dope or something.  Yeah, they're hoppers.  They're corner boys.  How dare I?  Right, Jimmy?  They're not just sweeping up...  What does that mean?  Corner boys should get kidnapped?  Corner boys and hoppers.  I watch The Wire.  All these white girls that go missing.  What if I just say they sell drugs?  She was selling drugs at Walmart on that video screen when the guy kidnapped her.  She was a drug dealer.  They knew...  Maybe meth. 
[00:46:30]  Patrice, they knew that there was a re-up going on, and they had to take the guy out.  Absolutely.  I've seen...  Oh, it looks like a little girl going to school with a book pack, but the re-up is in the book bag.  The Wire has taught me a lot about the hood.  Y'all make me...  It's just making it harder and harder.  Yeah.  Yeah, watch The Wire.  To like white people.  I'm trying.  This is dividing.  The Wire makes it very hard for me to like black people.  Whoa, Jesus.  Why?  It makes me love them more, actually. 
[00:47:00]  Why?  It's a joke.  I love The Wire.  Do you?  I love the black characters in The Wire.  I was about to say, Rick was right about you.  Oh, F.  Oh.  Rick's got a little surprise for himself today, by the way.  Ooh.  Ow.  Yep.  I was listening to that the other day, man.  He really had me in tears.  Backstabbing F.  Why can't we get along?  And the payback happens today.  I don't know.  It's just more divided. 
[00:47:30]  More right now.  Every year that goes by, black and white people.  And white people won't say that it's racial.  Like, it's always...  But black people won't either.  Yes, we do.  That it's racial?  That we are going to vote for Obama because he's black.  Oh, no, no, no.  But white people won't say he won't vote because he's not black.  No, you guys keep that under your hats.  Obama even said, he goes, this isn't a race thing.  This has nothing to do with it.  And meanwhile, you look at the southern states that he's winning by ridiculous amounts.  Yeah, but he's also winning Maine and Portland. 
[00:48:00]  All these weird white places.  I think it's fixed.  I think the guy is getting the young white vote.  Yeah.  You think it's rigged?  No.  I said...  No, stop it.  I said rigged.  All right?  Could you just calm down?  I said rigger.  Who's the rigger that's actually rigging things?  Who's the rigger?  And what do you call the person married to that person?  Patrice O'Neill in studio today. 
[00:48:30]  Who's the rigger?  Patrice brings a lot of energy to this show.  And then I end up taking five-hour naps after your appearance.  You exhaust the hell out of everybody.  Everybody in studio, the people listening out there.  High energy, this Patrice O'Neill.  Yes, Jimmy.  This is why, Patrice, they didn't drag him away.  Because when he walked in, Obama goes, you're an eBay guy and I know it.  And they said the Secret Service agents shuffled the shop.  They got the guy out of there and the guy started yelling, don't grab me.  I'm not doing anything.  It's almost like they saw he wasn't a threat. 
[00:49:00]  He was just irritating.  Don't tase me, bro.  Yeah.  You never know.  Exactly.  But it looks bad when that happens.  That's why they didn't because there's probably no way to drag this.  He wasn't a threat.  They knew he was just an annoying guy.  Wow.  And they probably didn't want to handle it by dragging him away with him kicking and screaming.  Back in the 60s, they had to just put pills in his mouth and he would have passed out.  Jimmy, you know what?  I changed my whole thing on this.  Jimmy's so on to this.  Of course.  That's why.  With this YouTube environment going on, you can't have a situation.  And that's why Obama was stupid to not just...  I understand the guy was annoyed. 
[00:49:30]  As a man, he was right to just tell the guy to go F himself.  But it's like you're in a...  You never refuse a handshake or picking up a dumb baby.  All right.  He's losing his cool.  Jimmy got me.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, you got the cameras rolling.  If there's an incident that's on YouTube and it gets 10 million views within two days.  He lost his cool over a situation that he probably should have handled  differently.  Right.  No.  This guy, if you look at this picture, this guy, he's...  Somebody running for the President of the United States is holding the guy's shoulder  going... 
[00:50:00]  As a regular dude...  Yeah.  Explaining to him as a regular dude, he doesn't want to take this picture.  Right.  And it really...  He's in all his right to have a finger signal to have somebody make this guy disappear.  Go away.  He probably does.  And he probably didn't use it because the Secret Service agent has his hand on the guys.  They obviously know he wasn't a threat.  The last thing they want to do is get Barack Obama killed while they're watching.  His signal is he tips.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  This is the break sign.  We got a break.  We can continue right after a few messages. 
[00:50:30]  Also, Sergeant G from Iraq writes, ha ha, Opie.  He's winning white states like Maine and Portland.  I just meant like...  Wait.  I just meant like white areas.  I picked a city and a state.  I understand.  How do you know he's in trouble?  He said looked instead of lookeded.  All right.  Back to the guy.  We're going to go to break.  We had Leslie Nielsen on the phone recently, and it was a train wreck of an interview because  Leslie is old.  Leslie is deaf.  Leslie has Alzheimer's. 
[00:51:00]  Leslie might have had a few little strokes.  There was all sorts of things going on with this guy.  Leslie from Airplane, from the Airplane movies.  So we go to break with this little piece that Derek put together.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Mr. Nielsen.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Leslie.  How are you, sir?  Are you?  I'm Paul McCast, yeah?  Yes.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  We should play drunk or stroke. 
[00:51:30]  And you mean stuff to do comedy?  Exactly.  Okay.  Stroke?  Drunk.  Or Alzheimer's.  Drunk.  This is about the roughness connection I've been on in a long time.  It's called a synapse.  That's the bad connection.  I'm glad to see that you're having a good time.  You should have a good time at this point in your life, too.  And I would just drive blindfolded down the Pacific Coast Highway.  They're having a great time. 
[00:52:00]  Let them go, please.  That's what I'm begging God to do.  Mr. Nielsen.  Leslie.  Hello?  Hello?  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's not forget, tomorrow, tickets go on sale for the O&A Animation Festival.  8 a.m.  It's Ticketmaster, right?  Yeah.  Cheap ticket. 
[00:52:30]  $10.  Yeah.  And a service charge.  That might be another couple bucks.  Thursday, the 5th of June, I think.  Correct?  That's when we're doing it.  And we wanted the tickets to be free, but the problem is with these venues, we couldn't  get a free venue.  It's not that we were making money off.  We just could not get a free venue.  Yeah.  For $10, that's a dumb service charge.  It's going to be a great night out.  Absolutely.  You're going to be hanging with a bunch of fans and us and watching some of these animations  that people have made about the show, some comics, and I do believe beverages will 
[00:53:00]  be available.  Just a few.  Yeah.  Roseland Ballroom, June 5th, here in New York City.  The ONA Animation Festival.  All the info is up on onaradio.com.  So, to the animator, start animating.  Yep.  We've got thousands of dollars in prizes to give away.  We've gotten really good ones for free.  It's like, you might as well do it for money.  No kidding.  Maybe they're holding back.  Something tells me people are holding back and they're perfecting them between the  sevens.  Ooh, getting the real good ones.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of us.  We'll sell out a venue and then we'll figure out the event.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  That's how we do it.  Believe me, here's what's going to happen Thursday the 5th at 7 o'clock.  How are we getting there?  I don't know.  Kenny said we had a car.  Well, GH will pick you up if you want.  I'll come and get you.  Unbelievable.  Phone number 877-212-ONDA.  Lots going on.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in the studio.  Also, we unveiled our April craziness today.  And now the promos are just flooding in.  Oh, yeah.  As long as we've got promos.  Well, we played the first one about an hour ago.  We already have a second promo for April craziness. 
[00:54:00]  Once the promos get played, we're obligated to actually come up with something.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony get crazy this April.  It's April craziness.  It's so crazy.  It's April craziness.  It's completely insane.  It's so bad, it's awful.  April craziness on the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy?  I can't listen to it, even to be ironic.  That's why we play them. 
[00:54:30]  I'm telling you.  Oh, my God.  It really hurts.  It's painful.  I love it.  I love it.  I think I love it because I know it annoys Jim.  So, we asked for some Scott and Todd audio.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know what's going on over there.  This is a popular show here in New York City, and I'm starting to wonder why.  Starting?  Well, you figure that there's an audience out there for some of these shows that we just 
[00:55:00]  can't understand, right?  Yeah.  But this Scott and Todd, man, Scott can't talk anymore, and he's still doing radio here  in New York City.  There's something wrong with his choppers, I think.  Well, there's been rumors of plastic surgery and all sorts of Botox and stuff like that.  I'm starting to think his face is too tight to move the jaw so we can get the words out.  So, we can't really talk.  So, we got some quick samples of what they're doing this morning.  Listen to this voice. 
[00:55:30]  It's not a bad day.  Oh, yeah.  They got her on charges of resisting arrest with violence.  That's a bad day.  So, Rebecca Reyes, or Reyes, R-E-Y-E-S.  I would say Reyes.  Reyes.  Oh, Reyes.  Reyes.  105 pounds.  That was it.  Just replace the taillight.  I think that's the least of one of the problems.  No, I know.  She's got some issues going here.  You know, it's one of those.  There's a lot of beautiful women who get into that kind of thing. 
[00:56:00]  They get, I don't know why, but they just, you see it all the time.  What's the old coach of Notre Dame, Norton?  I don't know.  What?  The old school coach.  Newt Rockne.  No, one of their famous ones.  He looks like the rock part of Newt Rockne.  Anyway, they sound just like him.  What the hell were they talking about?  I don't even know what they were talking about.  And he's got like this spit thing going on.  Like, you can't control his spit. 
[00:56:30]  Did they get anything accomplished there?  I don't know what that was.  Yeah, there was a woman who apparently got arrested.  He didn't eat the rare ass.  Sorry, why?  Yes, rare ass.  Yes, rare ass.  He sounds like Voss.  If Voss sounded better.  Why don't you just replace the taillight?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, oh, good gosh.  Guys.  And then there's a big story here in New York.  Jerry Seinfeld rolled his car.  He's fine.  Nice.  Out there in the Hamptons driving around, you know, to and fro his huge East Hampton mansion. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, he's got that giant place out there.  And he was in a, what, a Fiat?  A Fiat?  A Fiat.  A 67 Fiat.  A 67 Fiat.  And the brakes, what?  Just quit.  The brakes failed.  Elaine, the brakes failed on my car.  What do I do?  And then he pulled, what, the emergency brake?  And that wasn't working too well.  So then he decided to turn right hard.  And that made him roll.  There were canned laughs going on. 
[00:57:30]  Kramer!  Kramer, Kramer, I can't stop my car!  What do I do?  I don't know, Jerry.  I think the **** cut your brake line.  It's the ****, Jerry.  I can't believe it.  I rolled my Fiat.  What do I do?  Call the ****.  They'll come and burn it for you.  You'll get the insurance money.  Just make sure **** do it. 
[00:58:00]  What the hell's he doing?  I don't know.  He owns like 200 cars or something crazy like that.  So he drives around in the piece of crap one.  The one that could possibly fail on him.  Yeah.  You'd think he'd have all of them in impeccable condition.  He's got a garage on his property that is way bigger than anyone's house that is listening to this show.  On 83rd Street, he had a building for five years, a brownstone, renovated into being this garage. 
[00:58:30]  Converted into a garage that lifts the cars up five stories and stacks up his classic cars and Porsches.  And then he pulls out a Fiat.  This old Fiat.  How come a white guy could do that?  And there's so much love and respect when you talk about it.  If a nigga did that, you would just be all day long talking about, what's wrong with him? 
[00:59:00]  Because the cars are being stolen.  Did you hear what 50 Cent did to a house?  He turned a damn brownstone to a garage.  That's crazy.  Seinfeld is a classic.  He's a collector.  Because everyone loves him.  Frivolous.  Because everyone loves him.  Black people are frivolous.  White people are collectors.  You watch that show, Seinfeld.  People love the guy.  Oh, he's so funny and non-threatening.  He had 200 cars.  A 50 Cent had 200 cars.  I think it'd be a problem.  I think it's pretty crazy that he turned a brownstone into a freaking parking garage. 
[00:59:30]  For five years, they complained.  The neighbors hated it.  Out of their minds.  All you hear is car elevators going up and down all hours.  I want car number 32.  It's on the third floor.  Get me my Porsche.  Get it going.  Jerry, you ought to get a c***er to work here to bring your cars down for you.  It's a c***er, Jerry.  I was reading he has 47 Porsches. 
[01:00:00]  47.  47 Porsches.  Just Porsches.  Yes.  Do you think as the car is rolling, he's just thinking $250 million.  $250 million.  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  Riding a car made of cotton.  Really?  I hate stories like that because I do kind of like going out and driving.  He's driving a car before safety.  Like those cars before safety.  Yeah, before there was safety.  I don't need seatbelts.  Yeah, he's worth about a billion dollars and he still has the seatbelt that goes across your waist. 
[01:00:30]  It's got the steering wheel that just goes right through your chest if you hit something at five miles an hour.  No safety check.  Yeah, no airbags, nothing like that.  It's a thing of the future.  That's the first thing they do in commercial now is just to, you know, it's got a three in safety.  And that's the first thing they say.  Well, they always talk about that driver's, passenger's, back, side, curtain, airbags, you know.  Airbags pop out of everywhere now.  Yeah.  Back then, you got a metal dashboard.  He's driving one of those cars, that oil slick comeback like a spy car. 
[01:01:00]  Or you ever see Get Smart when it's driving slow and then all of a sudden it just speeds up real fast and it drives slow again.  He's driving a Backspot car.  He probably has a death wish.  He's tired.  Yeah, you think he's tired of the whole thing?  Just, ah, kill me.  Jerry Seinfeld should never roll a car.  He has enough money to prevent that from happening.  I would have loved to have seen him crawling out of the wreckage.  Like, because everyone does, you know, it really humanizes you and humbles you, I think, when you just, I'm crawling from the wreckage. 
[01:01:30]  Elaine, pick me up.  I'm on Long Island.  Who cut his brake on?  I'm crawling.  It was the ****, Jerry.  They cut your brake like, they're jealous of you, Jerry.  They're jealous.  The **** are jealous.  Kramer, stop talking about this ****.  Just crawling out of one of the windows, one of the busted, or the windshield or something. 
[01:02:00]  I'm crawling out of my windshield of my Fiat.  Help me.  Were you swerving to avoid a ****, Jerry?  There aren't any of those in the Hamptons.  Or a squirrel.  What was it?  Did you think you saw Bigfoot?  Or a ****, Jerry?  Oh, jeez.  Terrible, man. 
[01:02:30]  Make a great episode.  Jerry rolls his car in this hilarious episode of Seinfeld.  How scary is that?  Yeah, it's pretty scary.  Have you ever done that?  How do you even roll a car?  Never rolled a car.  That's usually some type of, you're avoiding something at high speed.  Oh, and then you just...  Yeah, you gotta...  No, because he pulled the emergency brake.  That wasn't working.  So now he turns hard right.  He was turning hard right to try to get off the road, and that's what made the roll.  And then I guess the roll stopped right before a lot of traffic that was flying. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, this was a close one for him.  This was a close call for Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld almost got killed.  That would have been something.  Imagine that in the news.  We're reporting now that Jerry Seinfeld was killed in a car accident.  Oh, they'd be doing all kinds of retrospective.  Yeah.  He was at the comedy show last night.  He went on and...  Oh, so he's okay.  Oh, yeah, he's fine.  He was there last night.  It was so funny, too, because I went on...  Last night?  What a trooper.  Kevin Brennan.  It was so funny, I watched Colin get bumped. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  That's right.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld's here.  Act like you're a co-sign for it, Colin.  Jerry Seinfeld wouldn't do you mind if I was a co-sign for it, Colin?  Colin's trying to act like he volunteered for it, but he really got bitched.  That's so good.  Yeah, he'll take a bump later.  What's wrong with that needy, psychotic sign?  Why would you go on stage after you roll your car?  Why would you go on stage after you get $250?  Why just...  Bro, what is he doing? 
[01:04:00]  I'd go on and take a dump every night, and they'd probably go, look, you can't come back anymore.  I know you're Jerry Seinfeld, but you can't do that anymore.  Jerry just squats on stage.  With his fingers up, taking a dump, and then just gets up and walks off without a word or an explanation.  And then covers the dump up with some money.  He throws a few hundred, like Sonny Corleone.  He covers up dump.  Covers it up like a cat does.  But use the money.  He scratches money over his car. 
[01:04:30]  And just walks off.  Scratching hundreds over his car.  Rolls another car.  Just walks away.  He's bored, obviously, huh?  I guess so.  You gotta be.  You do a movie, you do stand-up, and then you want to go on stage and go back to stand-up.  He's a comic.  Started this break talking about Scott and Todd and how awful Scott now speaks.  And it just so happens they did their own Jerry Seinfeld bit today.  Let's see how that was.  You just heard ours.  We'll compare what they did now.  You see that story about Jerry Seinfeld, too. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's okay.  I guess he was tooling around in his classic 67 Fiat.  One of his many vehicles.  Well, you know what's funny is this is the car.  A lot of guys who collect cars have a driver car as opposed to the ones that are their real show cars.  Unfortunately, this was one of his driver cars.  That's one of the cars that they obviously tool around in, right?  Right, exactly.  Where's the funny part there?  Yeah.  She's like, something funny about this.  You know what's funny? 
[01:05:30]  This was one of his driver cars.  He's got his cars that he collects that he doesn't drive, but this was one that he takes out and drives.  That's really the funny part.  Yeah.  Well, she wanted to talk about, I think, the fact that a lot of times they have multiple...  Quiet hole.  Who the hell is listening to this crap?  Was that done?  Yeah, that was it.  Well, then they have this part of it.  Oh, okay.  It's a two-story building, Joe.  He has five years to renovate it. 
[01:06:00]  He doesn't care.  Nah, you got so much money.  He's got full-time people that work on it.  Yep.  How many people does it take to take care of that many cars?  Four or five, Patty?  Twenty, Jerry.  How many does it take to hold up your face, rockhead?  That's a stupid rockhead.  This may be so unnecessary, but that's the difference between funny people and these people.  You can hear the silence that they were having trouble trying to figure out what to do with this.  How this is funny.  I'm so glad you brought that up. 
[01:06:30]  Funny people just go, I'm going to try to make anything funny.  I'm just going to think of an angle and say it and actually be attached to it.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to find a funny angle in this real quick.  And just screw around.  Or the passionate angle or something.  Something.  They were, it was times where somebody, it was like, it was silence.  Yeah.  Where they were going, they wanted to just go, well, you know, he's safe.  So, Jerry Seinfeld rolled his classic Fiat last night.  He's got a lot of money and cars. 
[01:07:00]  Shit.  Yeah.  Shit.  So, what, I don't know.  I heard that he, the one he drives, that's the one he likes to drive.  Yeah.  He likes to drive that one.  And I also read that he likes to drive a, like a 1980 one.  Like a 1980, an 80 Porsche?  Yeah.  Does he keep that in a brownstone he renovated?  How many people do you think it takes to run that? 
[01:07:30]  How hard is that?  Holy mother of God.  How hard is that to do on the radio?  What drivel.  I think it takes about two people because one, he has to bring the ticket.  Two people?  Yeah.  Did someone pick my job off the floor?  They were just listing facts.  Yeah.  You know, it's 55.  Oh, that was our...  You know, Jerry, that's weird.  People only, he's been retired for, the show went off the air.  They're like almost 10 years ago.  Yeah, 10 years ago.  I saw the final episode.  Did you see that one? 
[01:08:00]  Well, now it's time for traffic and weather.  So that's our sign called Brit.  I was going to...  We're going to do a loony tune next.  That'll waste two minutes.  His skull looks like it weighs about 80 pounds.  It's a giant fraudulent...  He has a Halloween mask face.  His head looks like Tarantino's skull, prop skull in Dusk Till Dawn.  Wow.  When it hits the floor.  Nice.  Yeah.  He's got Terminator head.  It looks like his lower jaw is just getting very heavy.  Yeah.  Something's going on there. 
[01:08:30]  It's going to just fall off his face.  It's like he's got that big bulbous chin.  Like a big bulbous chin.  Okay.  A Saturday Night Live prosthetic.  It's one of those makeup face jaws that they put on when they're doing like a Leno bit.  Yeah.  God, yes.  That's exactly right.  Because you could almost picture what he would look like with that taken off and having a normal face.  I'll tell you, it looks like Mickey Rourke.  Yeah.  So I don't know what's going on with Mickey Rourke.  Wow.  Can we finish up the second half of this wonderful Jerry Seinfeld garage thing? 
[01:09:00]  There's more?  There's more to it?  Yeah.  Why didn't you tell us?  Maybe that's when they get to the funny.  Okay.  Laughing hats on, folks.  Laughing hats on.  I took mine off for a second.  That's right.  Just to make everyone uncomfortable, we're going to start this part over again.  All right.  It's a two-story building, Joe.  He has five years to renovate it.  He doesn't care.  No, you've got so much money.  He's got full-time people that work on it.  Yep.  How many people does it take to take care of that many cars?  Two thousand.  Five, Patty. 
[01:09:30]  Probably.  Because you've got to take care of it.  You've got to clean them.  You've got to do the maintenance on them.  They've got to run a little bit to keep the engine.  What do you do?  One-wide-drive Porsches.  Plus, you've got to keep the building up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've got, what about all the paperwork on these things?  Oh, you've got to make sure the registrations and, you know.  I have a hard time with two cars, just trying to admit which one has got the inspection.  Well, a lot of them aren't even registered for the road.  Oh, I see.  You know.  Laughing.  Come on.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:00]  That's the funny part, right?  Is that they were doing a break that was, they weren't seriously doing that.  Attention, people that are working their asses off, listening to our show today.  That audio you just heard is from a guy that makes millions of dollars a year.  Millions of dollars a year.  As you slave away at your job.  What do you think the paperwork is like for this?  That's, you know.  Crazy.  Like Jerry's at Motor Vehicle. 
[01:10:30]  Online at, part of the Motor Vehicle.  Register.  I like to register 8,000 cars.  Right.  Can you imagine you've got to register all those cars?  Yeah.  There's, uh...  Yeah, how does he carry all those license plates back?  Can you imagine?  It's got to get heavy when you're...  Can you imagine the insurance?  The insurance on having 200 cars.  Well, what about checking tire pressure on so many cars?  That's four per car.  So now you're quadrupling even the number of cars he has, and you're putting a little air thing in the stem. 
[01:11:00]  I know he's a billionaire, but with cash prices, now they are.  Can you imagine filling up 200 cars if the prices were...  Renovated the building.  Right.  The building was originally, I believe, a textile mill back in 1857.  That's where...  Can you imagine the neighbors?  They must be...  My face.  What is it?  My face is trying to... 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  He didn't even go for a Kramer Newman neighbor joke.  Like, he's just disinterested.  Yeah.  Totally disinterested in the story.  But why report it?  It's just...  Report, like, the most inane, boring facts.  But there's an angle.  You said he used to own that building.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the angle on that is, who bought it?  Who bought that one?  Who bought his giant garage townhouse?  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Like, there's so many angles to go.  It's just like...  I'm going to go down and see who bought that.  I'm going to go to the town records and see who actually bought it.  Yeah.  Well, let's talk about the cars all over.  Imagine the air fresheners.  How many...  You think how many air fresheners are there?  You think all the cars need air fresheners or the new ones smell nice on their own?  Guys, the funny thing is...  What's the funny thing?  What's the funny thing?  No, you don't have to keep them starting. 
[01:12:30]  Don't you have to start them?  What is it?  No, you don't.  The stardom?  She probably just saw 48 hours.  Yeah.  She was worried.  Yeah, the Porsche wasn't going to start.  You know what?  I know we're going after Dennis and Callahan in Boston.  I know that fat pig Terry Clifford is on our radar.  Oh, that slob.  But Sam, drop everything and get us more of this guy.  I need some more of this.  So, uh...  Yes.  Can you imagine how many... 
[01:13:00]  Wow, I don't even have a thought anymore on this.  But we still have 30 seconds to kill with us before we get to traffic.  That's, uh...  How long does a tune-up take on all those cars to do a tune-up?  You know, there's a lot of spark plugs to gap.  If it's an eight-cylinder, and you're talking...  Now it's eight times the cars per spark plug that you're gapping and putting in.  That doesn't include wires and a distributor capacitor and points. 
[01:13:30]  This could take a while.  This could take a long time.  Oh, my God.  The guy makes millions.  You think he's under that?  To do nothing.  He's on a creeper underneath one of the cars.  Right.  Fixing it.  A dumb woman piping in.  And who dusts off all the bumpers?  Yes!  They could get dirty.  Stop it, hole.  How do they wash all those cars? 
[01:14:00]  How do you wash all those cars, you think?  You think there's, like, a car wash day?  Hey, Scott.  Yes?  Hey, what's going on with that pregnant guy?  Oh, there's a story about a man that's pregnant.  That's an amazing story.  I don't know to believe it.  You think that's true?  I think it's possible.  I don't know.  You think I give him a sonogram?  Uh, yes.  See what's in there. 
[01:14:30]  Because I know, uh, you know, people get sonograms when they're pregnant.  Where do they deliver that from?  How are they going to deliver this baby?  That's going to be quite a delivery.  That's a chore.  A P-section?  A P-section.  Stop throwing jokes in.  You think P-section?  You're ruining it by throwing an actual joke in, please.  You jerk, you jerk.  You're supposed to just be a name.  I thought that would be a joke. 
[01:15:00]  That wouldn't be a joke.  I thought they would say that joke.  They wouldn't do that.  Elaine!  Elaine, where's the crescent wrench?  I need a crescent wrench, Elaine!  Elaine!  You think Jerry's got a nice set of tools?  You think he buys good tools like craftsmen, so if they break, he can replace them free  of charge at steers?  Or do you think he buys snap-on tools? 
[01:15:30]  Hmm.  You're listening to the big show.  We call our show the big show.  Holy crap.  Who do you think got him pregnant?  Pregnant guy!  You talking about pregnant guys still?  Oh, uh...  How did he get pregnant?  Did he take one in the...  I can't say that. 
[01:16:00]  If he took one in the...  Wouldn't they be delivering a...  A...  A big lump of...  So they delivered.  Congratulations, you're the proud papa of a big lump of...  For the racist people out there...  Oh, jeez, don't even say it.  This is where you would place the racist joke.  Make your own racist joke. 
[01:16:30]  Congratulations.  You have a baby, but it stinks.  It's gonna smell forever.  Let's go to Andy in Boston.  Andy.  Hey, uh...  That guy sounds exactly like the guy from the movie Hannibal...  Who got his face eaten off...  And is like...  Talking up crazy.  Right.  The guy laying in bed...  With his face chewed up.  That's Gary Oldman's character.  Yeah, Gary Oldman.  Oh, that is funny.  Thanks, Andy.  All right, we do have to take a break.  Sam, we're obsessed with Scott and Todd. 
[01:17:00]  Yes.  We're obsessed with these zeros...  That have been wasting space on the radio for years.  Patrice hit it right on the head, though.  They just had nothing.  Yeah.  And they were just trying so hard to get traction.  Like Jerry on his car.  They were trying to get traction, and their show rolled over.  Look, let's take the people inside a little bit here.  You know, radio's not easy to do.  There's some, like, things that pop up on the news, and you're trying to find an angle,  and maybe sometimes you miss, right? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, of course.  Not sometimes.  You definitely miss.  But with the Seinfeld story, if you can't make something out of that on the spot, you  have no business being on the radio.  What is that?  I don't know.  Looks like two guys standing next to Mount Rushmore.  Oh, wait.  That's Scott and Todd, I guess.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Poor Scott Shannon.  Who's that fruity guest?  We've got to retire, Ant, before we get to this point.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, I know.  Yes. 
[01:18:00]  Frightening.  Coming up, we're going to...  What are you talking about next on the big show?  Well, we're talking about the Obama and the guy that wanted a picture.  I think we should discuss that.  I believe he had a Canon digital camera with probably a four gigabyte memory card in there.  He could have taken a lot of pictures with that one.  What do you think?  Where was Obama?  Yeah, I don't know.  I agree with him. 
[01:18:30]  He was eating.  He was going to get something to eat, I guess.  What does he like?  Probably a nice steak.  I would have a steak.  I like steak.  French fries.  Well, he was in Philly.  You've got to think Philly Jesus.  Yeah, you've got to think of cheese steak.  You're right.  You're our cheese steak.  You're our cheese steak.  I like cheese steak.  I actually have two in my lower jaw like a pelican.  I carry it around.  I've got an idea.  Why don't we do a bit of favorite food to eat after the break in honor of the Obama... 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Wow, did he get stung by a bee in that picture?  It looked like he's allergic to bee stings, and they got him in the lower face.  He has a big pimple chin.  What is going on with...  Look, E-Rock, you know a little something-something about a lot of these shows.  Come on, you worked with these guys.  What is going on with Scott's face from Scott and Todd?  Of what?  What did you tip your hand back for?  Say it, you bastard.  Drinks a lot of water? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, he may indulge once in a while.  Oh, really?  You've heard that he's an alcoholic?  Jeez.  We don't know that for sure, obviously.  No, no, no.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I work with an alcoholic myself, so...  Like, hey.  But for some reason, it doesn't affect him at all, which has amazed me for years.  I try.  How old is he?  He's 27.  Look at him.  And how old is that fruity David Spade that he works with?  In his 40s. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, he's 20 years younger?  Yeah.  I don't know why I just did the math.  You know what?  The frosting thing, if you're young or if you're flea, maybe the frosting thing works  for a little bit.  I don't know.  But when you're in your 40s and you're still frosting your hair...  Frosted.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Probably not even frosting.  It's probably just batches that he couldn't swallow.  Hey, why are you frosting your hair?  How do they do that? 
[01:20:30]  What kind are you using?  What kind of frosting you use?  Speaking of frosting, I like cake.  I like frosting on cake.  It's good stuff.  Why are we in this business?  We hate everything.  I don't know.  Why don't we take a break?  Patrice O'Neill in the studio.  Yes.  I was just looking at Ben Kingsley on television and then I realized, oh no, that's Jamie Lee  Curtis.  I was just looking at that too.  I wasn't even going to bring it up, but what did she not do to herself?  Oh, she's awful.  She just, I think she, because I read an article about her where she just said she's not even 
[01:21:00]  going to try anymore to look good.  So she gave up on herself.  She's just like David Cohn.  She's just creepy looking.  A David Cohn reference?  Love it.  She let her hair go gray.  Yeah.  And it's cut really short.  She's wearing these spectacles, these bifocals.  He called it Ben Kingsley.  All right, let's see.  She's all looking dopey hermaphrodite. 
[01:21:30]  We are 20 minutes late for a break.  Oh, damn, no.  This is not good.  A hand, no.  This is what I need after the break.  I need somebody, maybe on Pal Talk or maybe on Instant Feedback.  I need someone to keep track of all the people we have made fun of today alone.  Oh, it's brutal.  O.P. and Anthony.  Hanging with Patrice O'Neal today.  Giving us a lot of energy.  I love when Patrice stops by.  The O.P. and Anthony show, by the way.  Phones are lit. 
[01:22:00]  We'll go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey, man.  Love you.  Love the show.  Shut up, Kevin.  How would you like to hear a show with Scott Shannon, Ralph Kiner, Dick Clark, and Kirk Douglas?  I would love that show.  It would be the number one radio show in America.  Tune in every morning.  Every day I would tune into that.  Thank you, Kevin.  You got it.  We're trying to get more Scott and Todd audio because they're just terrific. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, they're great.  We were trying to ignore this dumb story, but we kind of referenced it before the breaks,  and now we're going to do a little something on it.  The pregnant man story.  Yeah.  What is this?  The guy was on Oprah yesterday.  What is this?  This is right.  Is he a man, or does he have a sex change from being a woman?  Had to be.  Used to be a woman?  I'm guessing.  Still has the parts?  Had to be.  Now I got it.  Had to be.  Is it?  I don't know.  Are you sure? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  The chest almost looks like flat breasts.  It looks like when they do that, when they make that operation, the way that the chest  kind of looks, that's what he looks like.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm getting some info.  This is why we're trying to ignore this thing.  Man, the media sounds amazed that a born woman, transsexual, can get pregnant.  They're amazed by that.  This is how it went down.  The pictures say it all.  That is 34-year-old Thomas Beatty posing with his wife, Nancy.  Thomas Beatty, legally a man, is having a baby. 
[01:23:30]  Back in the 80s, before taking sex change hormones, Thomas was Tracy Beatty, a beautiful  young female.  But now, Beatty's turning heads for a different reason.  Thomas is now recognized as a man and married to his wife for nearly five years.  They started a relationship as two women, Tracy, as Thomas was then known, and Nancy.  And then he began this transition from woman to man with hormones.  But Beatty kept his reproductive organs, allowing him to conceive the couple's first baby. 
[01:24:00]  It's a she.  It's a she.  This is America's scam to try to turn men into, like, to assistive men and gay women  are in on it.  Like, everybody's trying to make guys some type of girl.  And he's a woman.  It's a woman.  The chick who's pregnant, she's a hairy face.  I can think of five different ethnicities that could cover.  That thing still sits down to pee after all the hormones. 
[01:24:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then this next track is labeled.  I love how these guys label these things for us.  Danny did this one.  Oh, my God.  Thomas has cravings like an actual woman.  And just like others who are pregnant, Thomas says he has cravings, in his case, for soybeans  and artichokes.  And he's gained 12 pounds.  In the interview with People magazine, the father-to-be says even his own family has rejected  the notion of a pregnant man. 
[01:25:00]  Thomas' own brother has said that this child that he's carrying is going to be a monster.  Beatty says, I'm afraid.  Afraid of how people will react.  Afraid for our safety.  But for now, the Beatty family is proud.  Proud of pushing the envelope.  I mean, let me tell you what they're doing.  Here's what pisses me off.  Not even him.  Because he's doing what he's have to do.  Like, you know.  But that everyone is validating his wishes to be called a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, everybody's like... 
[01:25:30]  He.  He.  Because we don't want to offend this him.  This man is pregnant.  No.  It's a woman.  It's a woman.  If it didn't get rid of its reproductive organs, it's a woman.  Stop it.  Stop it.  The baby's going to be born like women give birth.  Yeah.  You know.  Ovaries.  You got to be careful, but, you know, it's going to be a regular birth.  You know, call me a woman from now on.  I'm going to push it in.  All right.  I'm going to stand there like Buffalo Bill. 
[01:26:00]  Just tuck.  And just...  You're going to do the tuck.  Just go to the...  One year.  Thank you.  We've all tried the Buffalo Bill.  Let's be honest with each other.  Just shove it right through.  Just for a goof.  For a goof.  I'm going to shave a landing strip, and I want you to call me a girl.  And that's it.  And I'm a woman who can't have kids.  Yeah.  I'm a woman with no ovaries and balls.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:26:30]  Just stop.  All right.  Enough of that thing.  What is it?  Now, is this a transsexual where they...  No.  No.  Right.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  And Oprah had him on, probably not even laughing at him like she should be.  Just saying, you know, you're just a waste of a segment.  And Morton Downey Jr. show was canceled 18 years ago.  We're not having you on.  She should have just had him on and just go, get the hell out of here.  Have him just thrown off.  But it's a girl. 
[01:27:00]  Kick it.  Kick it in the stomach with some Doc Martens.  Kick it right with some Doc.  See whatever piles out of it.  Just put his head on the side of the sidewalk like Ed Norton.  Chew the curb, you androgynous nothing.  Kick it right where his nuts should be.  I love the way she says, and he kept his reproductive organs.  Then it's a her.  Push. 
[01:27:30]  Push, you thing.  Yeah.  And with all the hormone treatment, whoever said it's going to be a monster is probably  right.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of thing is going to come out of there?  An 11-year-old with shoes on and a hat.  Little claws, like three fingers.  Rosemary's Day has all his fingers, but they're connected.  So it looks like two and a thumb.  They got some web crap happening.  Oh, Lobster.  One nail.  What's that movie?  What's that movie, dude?  Rosemary's Baby. 
[01:28:00]  No.  Total Recall.  No, when the babies were evil.  It was like a real cheesy one, though.  It was a classic, though.  So it, was it it?  Children of the Corn.  Hold on.  Wait.  Salem's Lot.  Into the mic.  Salem's Lot?  No.  No.  Salem's Lot.  I got so excited.  It was about evil babies that could just kill you, jump on your chest, cut you.  You know those things.  Hold on.  What, Eric?  Shawshank Redemption? 
[01:28:30]  He has Quato.  Quato hand.  Quato.  It's Quato.  All right.  Well, enough about the dumb baby.  Hey, Larry King's in a bit of trouble.  We love Larry King on this show.  I wish we had audio of this.  Larry King pitches fit at Suns Little League game.  How old is he?  His son's 51.  He's 74.  He's 74.  How old is his kid? 
[01:29:00]  Well, he's been married to this wife of his.  His sixth wife, by the way.  Sixth wife.  For about 11 years.  So the kid's got to be, what, 9 or 10.  9 or 10 years old.  He's got a 9-year-old kid.  What kind of selfish bastard is a 9-year-old kid at 74 years old?  74.  How embarrassing.  What happens at 75?  I remember 9 years old.  My dad was, like, drinking and stuff and just having a blast.  He'd take him to, you know, he would join me sometimes for father-son things at school. 
[01:29:30]  Before, you know, before he took off.  Yeah.  Would he embarrass you when he came in?  No, he was a cool dad because he was a private investigator and, you know, he was, like, the cool guy.  Yeah.  But then, you know, he took off and went to California to become a cowboy.  He had broads to bang.  What does a sperm dude just walk out?  Like, it just, like, he doesn't ejaculate.  It just walks on out.  Strolls with his hand behind his back. 
[01:30:00]  So, who's going first?  Just like that astronaut.  They just all look on the edge and just go, who's first?  There it goes.  Larry King.  Each single sperm comes out.  How important is the sperm count?  I hope not too important.  It comes out one sperm.  Yeah.  I've got four left.  Look at them swim.  They're in lanes like an Olympic pool.  You can count them.  And they're off. 
[01:30:30]  It comes out just like a Tommy gun.  Just one.  You can see the tails and everything.  And then so he doesn't waste none.  Whoever fertilizes the egg, that one goes, all right, nobody else come.  Stay there.  I did it.  Turn around.  Come back.  I might need you for another marriage.  They look like workers coming out of a manhole.  One at a time, slowly looking around.  His stretch. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, God.  Look at that picture.  Oh, he's just awful.  That's a good one.  It's alive or Village of the Damned?  It's alive.  Thank you.  My son's little league game.  That would have killed me all day.  It's alive.  A lot of people got that one, including Max from Dallas and others.  So there you go.  It's alive.  It's alive.  He looks like a fish.  He looks like a fish.  He looks like the big pussy fish in The Sopranos.  Oh, right.  That was talking.  Did we state the obvious about the man being pregnant, the man, in quotes, being pregnant? 
[01:31:30]  Like, why wouldn't the woman get pregnant in that relationship?  Yeah.  So obviously they wanted the attention, or could she not get pregnant?  What are they doing?  Now I need to know more about this.  To be on Oprah.  Maybe the inside of her womb looks like that room they shot Pesci in in Goodfellas.  Just a few things stacked up.  And that's what the baby's doing, going, oh, no.  I don't take any more hormone pills.  Oh, no. 
[01:32:00]  The baby's going to come out with a full beard.  And the father finds out that it's a healthy baby.  And he just slams the phone down and starts crying.  Couldn't be helped.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Why didn't the broad get pregnant?  There's got to be something going on with that.  But, hey, quick break to catch up, because we went way late in this break.  Please bear with us.  We'll do the Larry King story next after the break.  And let's not forget, once again, tomorrow, really quick, our first annual O&A Animation Festival. 
[01:32:30]  Tickets are going on sale June 5th at Roseland Ballroom.  The tickets are on sale tomorrow morning.  That's what I mean.  For June 5th at Roseland Ballroom.  You're right.  8 a.m.  It's $10 plus a service charge.  But get them early, because it's an 8 o'clock on sale, which is actually early for Ticketmaster.  That's right.  And all this info is on onaradio.com.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Hey, friendo.  Yeah, you just brought up a very, very good thing.  And I think everybody out there can relate to this. 
[01:33:00]  It doesn't matter if you're in radio or a mechanic.  It happens to everybody.  You want to explain what you were talking about during the break?  What are we talking about?  Patrice was listening to the show earlier this week when we went after our old producer,  Rick, because he decided to write this, not write, he decided to do this interview with  Steppin' Out Magazine.  He got himself on the cover.  That's all wonderful.  But the damage this article is going to do to this guy and his radio career, that's where 
[01:33:30]  he's just the dumbest person alive.  He is a fantastic bridge burner.  It's a horrid business because, I mean, I know sometimes you just have moments with  everybody.  I'm sitting there talking to Opie and I'm just like, yeah, you know, I never met my father  and I was touch funny by the guy at the garage.  And I just, you know, but I appreciate you, man.  You let me on the show, man.  It really helps a lot.  And now we're enemies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it would just.  Really miss the touch funny at the garage?  What?  Oh, jeez. 
[01:34:00]  Then it would be.  Let me tell you about Patrice.  One day it would just be, you know, one night I'm hanging out with Patrice, right?  Yeah.  And this guy is crying like a baby, like a little bitch.  And that's what it would turn into.  It would go from, man, I'm feeling you, you know, that really sucks.  And you know that he was touched.  Yeah.  You know that he was touched funny as a kid?  Yeah.  Obviously he wanted it.  And he just cries to everybody about it.  Why would he just run away from the pedo? 
[01:34:30]  Obviously he enjoyed the touching.  Like, it's just awful, man.  It happens to everybody.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  It's just people turn on you.  Like, I know you and Rick had moments.  Give me, seriously, without really trashing him.  Did Rick and I have moments?  Give me one moment that you know you and Rick had.  No, Rick is kind of a weirdo, man.  Rick kept everything inside.  He had a lot of father issues, and he didn't really open up to anybody.  He was a really strange dude.  He's a plastic.  We had lunch with him when I was in San Francisco, and there's just nothing. 
[01:35:00]  You're never going to have a real discussion with him.  It's all going to be surface nonsense.  Me and Kenny, we had, this was less than a year ago.  We sat down.  It was good to see him.  And we hung for him a while, and we agreed to meet up, and how you've been, and this  and that, and we'd love to see you back in New York.  I mean, like, a really nice time.  And then it's like, then he just goes and douches me in an article.  Yeah, the last time I saw him, we saw him on the sidewalk outside the station, face-to-face,  because in this article he says how, you know, I'm either a dick or a douche. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not sure, because they had to, like, censor that part of the article.  And he goes, but, and no one's brave enough to say it to his face, but I'm brave.  And I'm like, you're not brave.  We were on the sidewalk with you.  You were two feet from me.  He didn't say anything.  And it was nothing but cordial, and hey, how you doing?  How's life?  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, take care.  Good luck to you.  Type of conversation.  And then he does this dumb interview with Chauncey Hayden, who we hate.  He's just an ass.  And just completely destroys me.  Chauncey goes after the show, goes after Jimmy and his participation on the show, 
[01:36:00]  destroys the company that we work for.  So the company, they got to me.  Called me a comedic genius.  Yeah, how dare he?  How dare he do that?  And the company got back to me and said, look, because of that article,  we're not doing any business with this guy, you know, and he's been calling us.  And now we got another piece of the puzzle.  See, I did a lot for this guy, a lot.  I'm not going to toot my own horn, but trust me, I did a lot for this guy, 
[01:36:30]  including getting him an agent, because he didn't really want to be a producer.  He wanted to do his own radio show, hence the reason we didn't bring him back  when we came back to radio.  We need a guy that's behind the scenes and doesn't really want to be on the radio.  It's kind of key to the producer role.  Now, that's the actual reason, because that sounds like it was for him.  Huh?  That sounds like it was for him.  What do you mean for him?  Like it was done for his sake not to bring him back.  He had a gig.  He had a really good gig.  He was working for Preston and Steve in Philly.  You know, I don't really respect that show, but you can't argue that they're very, very 
[01:37:00]  successful in Philly.  And there was something you wanted him to do.  I remember we were off the air.  The first month we were off the air in 2002, there was something, or the first few months,  there was something he had a bunch of CDs or things pertaining to the show, and you kept  saying, Rick is not sending me this material.  I've asked him 20 times, and he's holding back this material from me.  He had incredibly valuable stuff that helped this radio show, and he didn't give it back.  And he ended up taking a lot of this stuff to Philly and giving it to Preston and Steve. 
[01:37:30]  He finally gave it back to me.  I'm like, what is wrong with you?  You were harping on that, though.  I mean, immediately after the show, he wasn't giving you the stuff that you wanted.  Right.  So, you know, he was fine in the business, and we were moving on in another direction.  Plus, you know, I just didn't want to be around him anymore.  That's true.  I just didn't really trust him.  I didn't know him.  Just a weird guy.  And then the point.  Oh, so I knew back in the day that he really wanted to try to do his own thing in radio, 
[01:38:00]  so we got him our agent, even.  Just one of the many things we did for him.  Bob Eatman wasn't going to take on Rick Delgado?  No.  We pushed that through for the guy.  Like, you know, just take him and see what you can do with this guy.  Well, guess what?  That relationship ended yesterday.  You dope.  That's how stupid you are.  Oops.  You know, you get a little fame for the next week because the magazine's out for a week,  and then you've got to deal with all the damage this interview has done to your career. 
[01:38:30]  And the dumbest thing he did, because the Hot 97 song with Todd.  The Tsunami song.  Well, those guys got dumped and, you know, whatever.  I still don't think they should have been dumped for it.  But as bad as that was, they were fired, and the uproar that caused.  And then he comes back, and he says, he's like, not that he should be apologetic about it,  but he's going, when I did that, I saw, like, this woman in the tsunami floating,  like, with a baby on her, and I just thought, comedy gold.  Like, that's what his response is after all this time has passed to that.  Right. 
[01:39:00]  Apparently, according to him.  He doesn't know how to play the game.  You've got to know how to play the game.  I mean, you know.  Well, at least learn how to phrase things right.  Yeah, we obviously do edgy stuff, but you've got to know how to play the game.  Yeah, his quote was something like, I saw the tsunami victims.  I saw a dead mother floating in water with her kids nearby crying their eyes out,  and I thought, comedy gold.  Like, what radio company is going to hire you after reading that in an article?  Yeah, reading a statement like that.  Good job.  Just an idiot.  So now he's lost his agent.  Good job, Rick.  Didn't even really offer to pay for lunch, and that really bothered me too. 
[01:39:30]  Good job.  But anyway, it goes back to what you were saying during the commercials,  like how, you know, you share moments with people, and then they turn and become your enemy.  We came up with this thing a while ago.  Your enemies become your friends, and your friends become your enemies.  It's just hard.  It just happens no matter what you do in this world.  And he was jealous, because he was the guy to go to when it was O&A in the afternoons.  He was the guy that would come in and pipe in on the interviews.  And then the more I came in, the less mic time that he got. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, he hates your little scummy ass.  Oh, yeah.  You totally blew up his spot.  And don't try to, well, you know, he's a good comic.  Really?  Thank you.  Well, yeah.  But I mean, don't.  Give him that.  But he ruins the show.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, it's been terrible.  The syndication.  Yeah, you're right.  Totally ruined.  The biggest show on XM.  Yeah, you're right.  It was awful.  I love Noah when he gets emotional, because he has no eyelids.  Yeah.  So he just looks like two little mouths talking. 
[01:40:30]  His little weird cartoon face.  He just gets upset.  You know, to do what he did.  Fury.  And to burn the bridges he did by doing this article, it just proves he's just bad people.  He's just a snake.  He's just bad people.  Simple as that.  That's a weird thing to do, man.  Simple as that.  It's stupid.  It's a guy with no judgment whatsoever.  A dummy.  A dummy.  But it makes you not want to share with anybody, because they can turn around and be your enemy  someday, and trashing you on another radio show, or at another job. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  But I'm going to tell you something.  What I learned in the last couple of months, I haven't been here in a while, and what I've  learned is that I can be a politician now.  Like, having secrets doesn't matter anymore.  Right.  You just come out, and you just say it.  I do coke.  Here's what I did.  I sleep with whores.  You just come out and say it, and then you go, and you run for office.  That blind idiot still had his hand on the Bible.  Like, it's the weirdest thing, and that guy, and this is not changing the subject, he's 
[01:41:30]  just saying this, like, before, you know, all little secret things, you just go, I don't  want nobody to find out.  Right, right.  You just say it.  And this guy's so arrogant, he don't even put on the make you feel more comfortable blind  guy glasses.  No.  Like, and you probably say, he just walks around with his...  With one eye going one way.  Yeah, and, but he just comes out, and he just says what he says, and I'm just saying, that  used to be bad, because, like, say even with your book, and all the stuff that, you know,  the Brazil stuff, you know... 
[01:42:00]  Norton's book.  Norton's book.  He was very honest in there.  Very honest.  You know, 20 years ago, it's like, you know, you go, Norton, why would you do that?  Yeah, that's going to wreck your career.  You're right.  No, you just go, yeah, I did it.  I cleared all the stuff about other people, though.  Like, I talked to Patrice first.  I talked to everyone I put in there.  Oh, yeah, that's a smart thing to do.  Yeah, yeah, I made sure it was okay that people didn't mind me.  I'm not clearing nothing when I write mine.  You're not going to clear anything?  Oh, hell no.  What's the matter with you?  I'm just kidding, man.  Just clear it, please. 
[01:42:30]  Could you just make sure you clear it?  I have become a nicer person.  A little nicer.  Really?  In what area?  Have you?  Where's that?  Hey, Larry King pitches fit at Suns Little League games.  See, we'll just change the subject.  Yeah.  Look at him change that subject.  I want to hear about where this is.  See, that was genius.  See, I don't understand why people don't know how genius that was just now.  Shut up.  Deflection.  I think you're a genius.  I'm going to do an article on Steppin' Out, and you're going to be a genius, and Anthony's  going to be the douche.  I'm going to be the douche.  You're going to be the douche.  And then I'll be like, Patrice, that guy, let me tell you about him. 
[01:43:00]  I've seen Anthony's attempt at having a muscle.  What?  What are you talking about?  When he makes it.  Great arms.  You look like the guy on the beach that the bully kicked the sand in the face of.  You know what his arms look like?  It's a snake in the middle of a meal.  Hey, leave him alone.  I've been working out.  Anthony's got some.  Show me your muscles.  Anthony, yeah, he's starting to get cut.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's starting to get a little cut over there. 
[01:43:30]  You're well-shaped.  What am I going to do?  Showing my muscles to men?  Why not?  What the hell's going on here?  Even though your muscles have crow's feet.  Damn, bro.  What's up, man?  Look at that genius arm.  Bulked up.  Look at Greg's genius arm.  Shut up.  You're douchey, muscles.  CNN fixture.  Larry King's nine-year-old son.  You guys asked the age of the son earlier.  Chance Armstrong King.  Yeah.  Chance Armstrong.  I want to call him Chance because there's a good chance he's going to be fatherless real soon. 
[01:44:00]  I'll call him Armstrong because he always juggles one ball.  Thanks.  What?  Lance Armstrong.  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, Chance Armstrong King was playing Beverly Hills Little League.  Wow, there's some great guys right there.  Wow.  I wonder if they take on the Little League team from Compton.  That's good.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Can you imagine that?  I'd like to see that match.  See that matchup.  Bunch of friggin' 16-year-old third graders acting like they're nine-year-olds.  They got a 70-mile-an-hour fastball.  Why are the blood players 16 years old?  Because they get left back a lot.  Oh, my God.  That's like what I'm saying.  Yeah, we're just keeping the stereotype alive.  What's wrong with that, Patrice?  It's a joke.  Look, everyone knows they drop out well before the 16. 
[01:45:00]  Compton Country Club versus.  We used to, quickly, because Compton gets brought up.  When I used to live out in San Juan Capistrano, California, it was a very white community.  Bunch of cowboys, rednecks.  I used to live out in San Juan Capistrano, where the swallows come back every year in  California.  When I was like, I guess from the time I was 12 to the time I was 14.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Formative years.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  And I'm convinced that's why I'm so screwed up.  Because of Capistrano?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  San Juan Capistrano.  It was very, especially back then.  So you're screwed up because of a lot of swallows?  Oh, I get it.  The swallows.  You know what, though?  You know what, genius?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yes, Patrice.  You don't deserve to have sarcastically knocked that down.  That's pretty funny.  I know, but I didn't want it to be funny. 
[01:46:00]  I wanted it to be sarcastic.  Like, kind of like a cheese ball thing?  That's the brilliance of it.  That's a change up, yeah.  Too many swallows is pretty funny.  I knew the line on its own was all right, but I wanted to take it to the next level and get  And that's the genius of you.  Thank you, sir.  Now, finish your story, douche.  Oh, right.  Okay.  All right.  Boo!  It was very redneck.  Very redneck.  Just very white.  Very redneck.  Now it's full of Mexicans and El Salvadorians live there.  Wait, when the swallows come back to Capistrano.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  That was where I lived.  It's where rednecks live.  Yeah, they used to.  I thought rich people lived there because of that song.  No, it was all just a bunch of rednecks.  And all of us rode horses.  We all had horses.  And every year, there'd be the Swallows Day Parade.  And the whole thing would last like a whole week.  You had the life of an adopted African child.  I really did.  All world horses and we learned all different things.  There was all kinds of stuff.  Oh, it broke.  We were broke all the time. 
[01:47:00]  Jeez.  My father would rather make sure the horses were fed than us.  Did you know this story?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I lived in San Juan Capistrano.  Okay.  And they brought in one year for the parade, which was only everyone from around town on  their horses, covered wagons.  I mean, all guys wore their real guns on their hip and loaded with blanks and used to shoot  it in the air.  And no one cared.  This is what went on.  And in one year, I guess somebody on the parade committee decided, let's try to make it a 
[01:47:30]  little more diverse.  We'll invite a group called the Soul Street Stompers from Compton.  Oh, damn.  Now, these were a bunch of kids from Compton that did this thing where they'd march, but  they'd stomp their feet, and it was cool.  It was like drum beats from them stomping their feet in different things, and they'd shuffle  one foot, so you'd hear like, as they're walking. 
[01:48:00]  It was pretty cool, but did not fit in with the Swallows Day Parade, that's for sure.  And all you heard from the sidelines of the parade, instead of embracing this diversity,  was the N-word just being hurled out like it was just the word of the day.  It was the word of the day.  Thus, the ruining of your life? 
[01:48:30]  No, that's the part that actually made me a little better, I think.  No, that gave them hope.  That gave them a little hope there, Patrice.  Hey, I was just done with such hate.  I didn't want to interrupt your story, but there was something in there that made me  take notice.  Yes.  So you guys were in the parade, and you're shooting your guns and stuff in the air, right?  Yeah.  And you know they're not all blanks, let's be honest.  Yeah, I think a couple of these cowboys, because they were pretty drunk, didn't have blanks.  With that said, how dumb are these birds? 
[01:49:00]  They keep coming back.  In fact, they keep coming back to this town where they're shooting guns up in the air.  Up in the air.  I was done with the blackheads for showing up.  Yeah, with a bunch of rednecks with guns.  Dressed like swallows.  That's just a stupid town in general.  We're the good old boys.  So that nice song is attached to just a ridiculous town.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very...  Now, not so much.  Then, hugely redneck, horses, everyone... 
[01:49:30]  How'd they treat you?  You was a little dark child with beautiful eyes.  Nah, they loved me.  Oh, yeah.  Because I, you know, I was a little cowboy.  What?  Ran a rent string for Jimmy Jackson.  What's wrong with you, Patrice?  Marines from Camp Pendleton would come up and rent horses, and I'd have to take them up  into the hills and show them around.  And they knew you were Italian?  Yeah, they knew I was Italian.  They didn't care.  As long as you're not...  As long as you weren't black.  As long as you're not black or Mexican, you were fine back then.  And some of the Mexicans were cool. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  But only if they were your friends.  Do you want to do the Larry King story or not?  Huh?  So getting back to Larry King and his nine-year-old Chance Armstrong King playing for the Beverly  Hills Little League.  Ugh.  On Monday, March 10th, during a heated game, the suspended talk show host apparently got  into a confrontation with one of the league's umpires.  Mr. King was making a fool out of himself as a manager on the field, talking in the  middle of the field.  He was off sides. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  It's a baseball game, Mr. King.  I don't care what you say.  Throw a flag on the play.  He's one of these idiot parents that have to get involved with their son's sports stuff.  You know, you think if you're 74 with a nine-year-old kid, you might want to keep a low profile.  Yeah.  You don't want to be the old guy out on the field because every other parent is just looking  going, ugh, here comes this crotchety douche to try to stick up for his poor kid.  According to the source, Mr. King was told by the umpire in question to regroup and calm 
[01:51:00]  himself.  And he did not respond well to this.  We've heard rumors about Larry.  You kind of can't tell him what to do.  I'm sure he's not a fan of what we do with him on this show.  You keep it up, ump.  I'm going to chew up some garlic and talk right in your face.  He continued arguing and was then relegated to the bleachers, where he continued to make  noise and was finally forced to watch the game from the outfield's periphery. 
[01:51:30]  He just kicked him off the field.  He just kept moving him further and further away.  What an old embarrassment.  That noise equals snoring from Denver Pest.  Nice.  Yeah, we could do that.  Well, we got a quickie.  One of my son's teammates, yes, I'm accusing him of steroid use.  Why is he still playing?  Question, umpire. 
[01:52:00]  You're a douche.  Comment.  Wasn't really a question.  I commented.  Do you have a question on if I'm a douche?  How important is the bat in Little League?  Tell me, ump.  He's interviewing the ump in the middle of the game.  Yeah.  Kid's his poor, embarrassed kid is sitting there.  Shut up, grandfather dad.  Grandfather dad.  Grandfather dad.  Kid probably does that.  Yeah, that's my grandfather.  Cries.  He's got to call his father, his grandfather to his friends.  I bet Larry hires someone to walk with that backdrop behind him at all times. 
[01:52:30]  Stupid colored one.  The light bright set.  Down in front.  Two guys just holding it up.  My desk.  He leans on it.  That was a home run.  He's awful.  Yes, he is.  Listen to this hamburger commercial.  What?  This is the greasiest burger joint in the country, where a unique love affair with deep-fried burgers  has employees asking, have you had your vitamin G today? 
[01:53:00]  The vitamin G would be grease.  Memphians live, devour, and breathe the Dyer's motto.  It's always good to go and pleasure yourself, you know, once a week.  The burgers melt in your mouth.  You take a bite and it just all comes in your mouth.  It's like one big explosion.  No, it's grease, I guess.  Is that real?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a real commercial.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound very healthy.  Jimmy, you think this guy likes hamburgers? 
[01:53:30]  I think he enjoys them?  No, I don't think he really likes them.  He loves them!  Oh!  Deep-fried hamburger.  Yeah.  Kind of looks like Sam's hair.  Sam, what do you got?  Poor Sam.  Oh, my God.  What do you got, Sam?  A little more Scott.  Oh, thank God.  That show has a lot of filler.  That's why it took so long.  Like, they play songs and bits and a lot of traffic and weather. 
[01:54:00]  So they barely get to actually chit-chat.  Yeah, but it's going to rain tomorrow.  Oh!  They talk about rain?  It should be raining tomorrow and then sort of into Saturday.  Oh, my God.  Clear the field.  We got more Scott and Todd audio after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Patrice.  Yeah?  You promoting anything today?  I'll be at the Laughing Post in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Friday and Saturday. 
[01:54:30]  What?  The Laughing Post in Kalamazoo.  The Laughing Post?  The Laughing Post, Friday and Saturday, two shows apiece, which means four shows.  You got a website?  Kalamazoo.  Website?  Patriceoneal.com.  Video blogs?  MySpace.  Video blogs?  I do blogs now, yes.  Yeah, I know you do.  I just sit there and I talk about things.  Do you get your blog on?  I don't.  I don't.  You know what?  It's the dumbest thing.  No, but he gets his blob on. 
[01:55:00]  Oh!  Oh!  You know.  You know.  What happened?  I was on your side for a long time.  Why do you got to go there?  But we were just having fun.  I mean, I shared with you that I want to lose weight, but you just turned that around into  blogs.  Yeah, like you would share that with us.  Who are you kidding?  I share that I eat only fruit at night now.  Yeah.  Yes.  Shared.  Sugar's fire is what's keeping you up.  Because natural food.  I can't eat an apple before I go to bed or I'm awake like a little rat.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Like a little rat.  As opposed to being, what, asleep like a little rat?  You're just a little rat in general.  You think I know that I didn't say that?  I'm 40.  I didn't notice that.  I was going to get smashed back in my face.  He chews up cardboard for a bed.  I'm with Jimmy, though.  I had one of those little fruit bars before I went to bed.  Oh, boy, did it keep me awake for hours.  Because I'm trying to help my friend.  He said he was up all night.  I'm trying to be gentle and help.  So don't eat fruit?  Not before bed, no.  No.  Natural sugars will keep you awake.  Awake badly.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  So what do I do at night?  Just relax.  Do some exercise maybe in the afternoon. 
[01:56:00]  At night, have something that's not fruit.  No caffeine, no sugar.  How about a little internet porn discussion?  Internet porn would be nice.  Absolutely.  Get some of the poison out before you go to bed.  Any kind of release before sleep.  Yeah, that helps.  Give him a sigh.  Wonderful.  You think?  Yeah, and then as you're cowling yourself off and she's crying and washing her hands,  you can start tosing off.  That's the worst.  When they're in the bathroom for 25 minutes washing their hands, like, wow, that was a  good acting job.  She really didn't enjoy this. 
[01:56:30]  So you think love has something to do with it or you think my girls are doing the same  thing?  What's love got to do with this?  No, your girl loves it.  Hey, Scott and Todd audio, I mean, you know, we really got to just stop this interesting  conversation that's going on because we got to get back to Scott and Todd audio.  So we have more Scott and Todd.  Scott and Sam put this together.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Who is that?  Gene Wilder. 
[01:57:00]  What?  Oh, no.  What?  Gene Wilder.  That's Gene Wilder?  That's Gene Wilder.  He doesn't look that bad, actually.  It's just his hair looks messed up.  He has cancer.  Oh, is that Gil the Brand?  He's got cancer?  Yeah.  What kind?  I don't know.  Hair.  Oh, my God.  Put a hat on.  Where are they?  You can't afford.  I figure you have enough money to afford CGI during an interview.  He looks like he should be looking through a screen door. 
[01:57:30]  Poltergeist 2.  Nothing gets past this man.  What is it?  3, 2.  I don't know.  It was one of them.  You're all going to die.  God is in his holy temple.  Oh, I don't want to see this, man.  This is horrible.  No, that's really kind of sad to see.  Jesus.  End of memoir.  We tried to get him on, but he wouldn't come.  He said he's too old for the show.  Really?  Yes.  I think I'll go to Gilder.  We would be nice to Gene Wilder. 
[01:58:00]  Of course we would be.  He's a genius.  I'm not being nice to him right now.  I don't want to go that far.  Oh, geez.  He'll never hear this.  I wouldn't go that far.  But face-to-face, he's the type of guy we would be nice to.  All right, listen.  Let's get to the sky.  Can you turn off the TV?  It's depressing everybody.  It's really bringing us all down.  We'll put a picture up on onaradio.com.  All right?  Get a screen cap of that or something there, Iraq.  Thank you.  Scott and Todd, do we have to explain why we're going down this road?  It came to our attention that they just suck. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  And something's going on with Scott's voice.  We think his jaw is dropping or he's got too much Botox or facelifts,  so he can't really get all the words out of it.  It came from the other day when we were listening to them comment on April Fool's Day in radio  and what that always brings every year.  But we noticed, screw what they were talking about,  Scott sounds like his teeth are falling out of his head when he tries to talk,  so now we're getting more clips. 
[01:59:00]  And now we're realizing they just don't talk about anything.  No.  And this guy makes millions and millions of dollars.  He's just wasting space.  A lot of it with that head.  Well, there's a lot of young broadcasters that would love the opportunity to do their show in New York City,  but you've got to wait for these old guys to drop dead on the air.  For some reason, New York City, they don't let go of their shows.  No.  You pretty much die in the seat.  Sam, what do we got?  Well, I think the first clip...  Need this job.  Old.  Compared to these guys? 
[01:59:30]  No, I said thank God they don't get rid of radio guys in New York.  We're fetuses compared to some of these guys that are still doing radio here in New York.  What do you got, Sam?  Yeah, this first clip, they talked to some random British guy who's going to be at a marathon  and really, I think, got the most out of him with this clip.  About the power of wasabi.  No.  Mentioned that.  It's good.  Oh, sushi.  How good is it?  If you like this one, you're going to love the second one and love the third one even more.  All right.  Well, that's a great endorsement from our own young Sam, Scott and Todd Audio. 
[02:00:00]  He is backing Brad to the tune of $10,000 now.  Wow.  Is that the race where that, what's her name, Paula Radcliffe?  Yeah, she had a few problems a few years ago.  Remember that, Todd, where she had to go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she stopped and whizzed on the side of the road?  Yeah.  The cameras came out and took photos of her and it was on the front page of old newspapers  around the world?  That was nice of them.  Yeah.  Great.  I mean, that lady's running a race.  You got to go.  You got to go.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  It just wasn't...  Probably shouldn't have stopped.  That's all.  Just go while you're running.  Well, what do you want?  What do you want?  See yourself on the picture of the paper?  On the front page of the paper with a picture of you whizzing?  Yeah.  I think it's a bit rude.  Is it a kid?  Should I try to hold it?  Did you hear that?  Like, did you hear it?  I wish I didn't.  Yeah, unfortunately.  Did you hear it?  One guy, this show, I'm just really listening to them.  Mm-hmm.  One guy goes in his mind, you can hear his mind go, okay, now we have, this is, we got 
[02:01:00]  something that could get us going.  And he throws it out there hoping that whoever the other guy is can, and they can get a role  going.  The other guy goes, oh, yeah.  So, it's one guy really, really wants, can you play it again?  No, I gotcha.  It's, what's going on here is Todd, he's still young and still wants to do radio.  Scott is waiting for someone to finally come in and put him out of his misery and tell him  he's got to retire.  Well, wait. 
[02:01:30]  That's exactly what's going on in the show.  You got a guy that's, how old is Scott?  60-something, you said?  There's like a 20-year difference between these two guys.  Yeah.  And he's like, she whizzed on the side of the road.  Yeah, Todd's like trying to get something going.  And he's being deflated.  You can feel him.  Yeah, Scott's like, I don't need to do this anymore.  Yeah, he's whizzing on the side of the road.  Wait, I think it might be the opposite.  I think that Scott might try to get rolling and Todd is the one who just kind of goes,  I don't know which is which.  Is that bad?  We can't even tell?  I don't know who's who, but somebody wants to get it going and the other one just goes, 
[02:02:00]  nah, I'm not having it.  They've been working together so long that Todd has caught this stroke mouth of Scott's.  Which one?  I don't know which one.  I know what you mean, but I don't know which one is the one.  Well, let's go to the next clip here, Jimmy.  Let's listen.  Scott wishes happy birthday to listeners.  Oh, I love that segment.  If you were in Dayton, Ohio, this is New York City.  Happy 16th birthday to Ariel Cruz. 
[02:02:30]  It was in Matawan High School.  Her daddy says her and her friends listen every day.  And Jenna Hardshoe, she's 13 today, goes to Felix Fiesta Middle School.  Daddy Ira listens to us.  Happy birthday to an old buddy of ours, Tony Orlando, 100 pounds lighter now.  Have you seen that picture of him on TV, Todd, where he's got his belly sticking out on the left side?  And, you know, you see him with the new Nutrisystem deal going on.  That's where you send away.  I was right.  You're right, Jimmy. 
[02:03:00]  Jimmy's right.  Scott's throwing stuff out there to see what sticks.  And Todd's just going, yeah.  Maybe Todd is sick of carrying this guy for so many years.  He's like, you know what?  I'm not carrying you anymore.  I'm not saying a word.  I'm not saying a word.  You crap out.  I'm just going to sit here and agree.  You see his belly hanging to the left?  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, Scott, his gargoyle face, is trying to be funny.  He's trying to get something going.  Good point, man.  And Todd's one who stinks.  Yeah, Todd's like, you know what?  You make way more money than I do.  I've been carrying this effing show. 
[02:03:30]  I'm detaching myself from your stone jaw.  Tony Orlando's like 100 pounds lighter.  Yeah.  You see the Nutrisystem?  You see that picture of him on the beach with the belly hanging up?  Yeah.  97 pounds.  Right, Todd?  I did.  You saw that?  Yep.  Saw it.  I'm on TV, Todd, where he's got his belly sticking out.  Oh, yeah.  On the left side.  And then, you know, you see him with the new Nutrisystem deal going on. 
[02:04:00]  That's where you send away and they send you that big box of food, right?  Don't they send you the box of food?  Oh, yeah.  You get it for a month.  Yeah.  Oh, that's just...  Here's something else.  Oh, that's so sad.  I have no idea, but I do believe these guys hate each other.  Really?  As much as we do?  Yeah.  Well, everyone knows we hate each other.  But even someone you hate, you could at least not just give them facts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  100 pounds.  Good point.  Well, you know what? 
[02:04:30]  Maybe...  All right.  Scott is trying, but what he's trying with, you can't do anything with.  Yeah.  You can't do anything with facts.  It's a double-edged sword.  Scott's throwing crap out there, and Todd is just not acknowledging.  How about Tony Orlando?  Say the Tony Orlando setup.  Tony Orlando lost 100 pounds.  Hey, hey, hey.  Your voice is too good.  Tony Orlando lost 100 pounds.  You see him in the newspaper with his belly all hanging out?  Oh, yeah.  He looked like that pregnant man.  I'm not saying it's a gem.  Ah, right, right. 
[02:05:00]  That's a pregnant man.  How about that pregnant man?  Yeah, no, it's really a woman, though.  Let's kill it.  It's like it's a straight man.  It's a straight man and a straighter man.  Like the straight man, he's going, wait a minute, I want to be...  The straight man and a straight man.  You know, you just go over to Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Hey, who...  Hey, Kramer, and then bam, right?  He's looking...  He needs that dude in his life. 
[02:05:30]  This is Abbott and Abbott.  Abbott and Abbott, right.  I was reading something.  It's all Moe.  Hardy and Hardy.  It's three Moes.  Three Moes.  It's because he...  I'm trying to think of more comedy, Dave.  I'm not done with this vid yet.  It's Martin and Martin.  Martin and Martin. 
[02:06:00]  That's a good one.  He's just going to sing songs to himself.  With no wacky, hey lady guy.  You want to hear one more quick clip?  Damn.  I want to hear these guys.  Oh.  All I want to listen to.  Well, Sam, this is great.  I love these.  These guys are such asses behind the scenes.  Sam writes,  Scott tells a hilarious story about Richard Hatch.  Well, this is really...  I mean, Scott gets this bit moving,  and you can tell from the length of the track  that they really go to town with this one. 
[02:06:30]  God damn Sam.  It's 18 seconds.  I just got to let people know before we play it.  18 seconds.  I said I'd find intro from young Sam.  Oh, that's funny.  The track is 18 seconds.  How about this story from Richard Hatch?  Oh.  Said he once smuggled matches on the Survivor  in his keister.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, got the hot butt. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  Pretty weird, huh?  Yeah.  Come on.  Now they're doing this on purpose just for us, right?  Come on.  How do you go nowhere with that?  Richard Hatch was smuggling matches.  That's one of the stories that we decided to pass on.  Yeah, just, eh, who cares?  You know, there's so many...  You can just do joke after joke,  but it's going to be the same.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, of course. 
[02:07:30]  Well, he had them because he also had a hibachi.  There you go.  Smuggle the hibachi.  He's a match.  It's positive and positive.  To go with some of that exaggerated humor with this story.  You know what it is, too?  They have no anti-establishment in them.  Yeah.  Like, there's nothing that they hate about society.  So, like, say if the FCC starts coming down on radio,  wouldn't care.  Because they're just, they're not attached to hating society.  They don't hate...  You can hear it.  Yeah.  It's just like, what's going on with this Obama? 
[02:08:00]  Nothing.  I don't know.  This is what I got out of that.  They hate each other.  They hate themselves.  Okay.  They hate doing radio.  Right.  Oh, ow.  They hate matches.  They hate matches.  They hate laughter.  Like, every time one of them laughs, I bet his face hurts.  Let's not say anything funny.  Don't laugh.  Because my face will crack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One laughs and the other one turns his head to the left sideways  and looks at him like...  What is that sound you're making?  What is that?  What's wrong with your face?  A lot of people being very hurtful on instant feedback. 
[02:08:30]  Really?  It's like...  Really?  Opie and Opie.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jiminy Crick.  Now you've gone too far.  I don't like that.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, oh.  I got it.  Can we please play that again?  Really?  I got to hear that, oh, oh.  Because he's just going, oh, jeez.  Oh, and then it's like, yeah.  It just ends with it.  It's final.  Todd sucks.  Yeah.  They both suck.  They both really suck.  Scott is trying.  That was a brilliant point.  There were a bunch of William H. Macy's. 
[02:09:00]  I'm trying to make jokes over here.  Scott.  I'm cooperating.  Not the type of radio that I like, but Scott is a legend for doing a lot of things in radio,  but he's far from that these days.  Far from it.  These guys, I got to stress again to the people stuck in their cars, miserable, going to their  dumb job.  These guys make millions and millions of dollars to do exactly what we're playing.  Yeah.  They're doing nothing.  I would take this gig tomorrow.  They're just babbling, and one or the other just doesn't want to hear it. 
[02:09:30]  But in this climate, though, they're perfect.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Right now, they're actually perfect.  You're right.  Patrice is right.  You know what I heard?  No, they're not perfect.  People do boring radio way better than this.  You're listening to one of those shows.  Come on, Jimmy.  I'm sticking to throwing the bounce passes.  I want to go in for a layup myself sometimes.  No, but at the end of this clip, you can almost hear Todd. 
[02:10:00]  He wants to say, will you shut the F up?  How about this story from Richard Hatch?  He said he wants smuggled matches on the Survivor in his keister.  Oh, jeez.  Got the hot button.  All right.  Pretty weird, huh?  Yeah.  Pretty weird, huh?  Pretty weird, partner. 
[02:10:30]  Sam, you got a new job.  You know that, right?  We can't let this go anytime soon.  They should just play at least jungle noises in the back.  Just a couple of things.  Something.  Some bird or, you know.  Something.  Maybe Jurassic Park clips.  Just something to make it have life.  You can hear the steam.  There's nothing there.  It's a constant flow, the feeling of, remember I'm just messed up, you know, with this thing?  Yeah.  And that moment of, you've heard the steam.  It's like, oh, oh. 
[02:11:00]  He went, oh, oh, and then he just went.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a whole show of uncomfortable moments of silence.  Like, if you did that to me, I would be hurt if I go, hey, Anthony, hey, O.B., Norton.  And you just go, yeah, Patrice.  I would go, I don't be, no one likes me.  I'm leaving.  Hold on.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He writes, oh, oh, no, no.  This is the other one.  Sorry.  It's updating way too fast.  Okay.  We're, okay.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, who the hell is? 
[02:11:30]  And he spells Richard, R-I-T-C-H-U-R-R-D.  And then he spells Hatch, H-A-L-D-G-C-H.  Someone is saying, please let this go.  How could you not enjoy this?  We're not letting it go.  How could you not enjoy this?  I just want to run their show, like, not even talk.  Just, like, let their show play.  And listen.  Yeah, just comment.  Do a little science, mystery, whatever that show. 
[02:12:00]  Mystery, yeah, sure.  Do a little of that.  Oh, yeah.  Anything else, Sam?  Yeah.  Did you hear?  No, I mean.  What happened to the rain thing?  You said if you like rain.  No, no.  I just said that they were doing weather so hard.  They were doing weather reports.  I knew the weather.  Oh, really?  You know, yeah.  He didn't record that.  It was a little too exciting.  No, they got Joe Nolan on weather.  I mean, come on.  Can you do them?  Can you do those guys commenting on when they hear you guys trashing them?  Did you hear that in a thing with Opie and Anthony? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, Opie and Anthony.  They were saying bad things about us.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  8.55.  Yeah.  They were saying some pretty bad things about the show, saying not funny, that we don't 
[02:13:00]  have a rapport and can't really comment on any subject.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's what they were saying, all right.  You get paid 10 times more than I.  You betcha.  This crap.  You betcha.  Yep.  So, you know, I mean, what do you think about that? 
[02:13:30]  Hey, I could do this bit.  We just need to.  We really need to do this every day.  See if we can get as successful.  Oh, tomorrow.  Oh, it would be perfect for today, Yorok.  Stupid tomorrow.  It's okay.  Yorok's got a tape of Scott Shannon from the 70s, and you'll hear a very, very different.  Wow, I bet.  Different voice.  Well, we'll compare the two.  Tomorrow, that's what we do with the show. 
[02:14:00]  We compare the two.  You know, we play a lot of our stuff from 10 years ago, Ant.  Yeah.  And I'm proud to say our voices haven't changed that much.  People have, no, there's a thread on Wackbag.  I mean, my voice is a bit higher at times from in the old days.  But besides that, for the most part, we're doing all right.  There's a thread on Wackbag that says that my voice has changed since we went to XM.  They could tell the difference between the old N.E.W. shows and these shows.  But no, they say my accent changed. 
[02:14:30]  Like, I had a much stronger Long Island accent back then than I do now, which is odd.  I really don't think so.  But they said when I get worked up, like that day, remember the day that that listener was  pinned by Master Poe down by the payphone?  Oh, yeah.  They said, I came out and just started going, yeah, you mother effer.  Yeah, you want to eff with us?  And it sounded like I came right out of, like, Suffolk County, South Shore, Bay Shore. 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  That's what they just had a big long thread about that on the message board that my voice has changed.  Yeah.  Scrum.  What do you think about that?  Eh.  Yeah.  Change in voice.  You know, I haven't really noticed it.  But, you know, some people are saying that.  And I've got to, you know, did you notice a change?  Eh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sure did.  Sure did.  We leave you with this, Patrice. 
[02:15:30]  Here we go.  The big plug, please.  We're heading out of here.  Laughing Post, Kalamazoo, Michigan, Friday and Saturday.  This Friday, this Saturday, two shows each night.

[02:29:00]  That is a mess  There's nothing worse  Than a flat chested fat chick  Flat sauce  We call them a flat sauce  Flat sauce  Flat sauce  They're unbelievable  At least have tits  If you're gonna be fat  That is unacceptable  That's unacceptable  If you're fat  You gotta have a little shape to you  That one  Jim Jefferies  Now your dad gave you advice  On fat girls  Well my mother's  A good 300 odd pounds  And none of me brothers  I got two brothers  And we all date skinny  Really skinny chicks 
[02:29:30]  And let it be known  You're not fat  I'm not quite a big guy  But I'm not American fat  I'm like you know  Australian fat  He's that strange fat  That I just can't stand  He's not officially fat  He's just an out of shape  Skinny guy  And it's nothing worse  I'm just a flabby skinny guy  He's Norton-esque  Shut up  Feel my muscle  What muscle?

No I did have a hot girlfriend  And then she left me  For a guy from work  Ran out  I came home  You remember seeing  The punch in the head  Tape that I showed you  Last time  Me getting punched in the head  Yeah  The weekend I came home  I had a black eye  And my house had been  Emptied out  And I just went  Oh that's about fucking right  And there was an engagement  Ring on the table  I was screwed  Oh wow  She left you for a black dude?  No she left me for a guy  That  No she had a  He had a black eye  A black eye 
[02:30:30]  Oh okay okay  She didn't have a black guy  Oh Jesus  And she ran off with some guy  From her work  From a job that I fucking got her  And you know  It was in it  Oh  What's happened?  That's a shame  Another  Oh fucking savage cocksucker  Another missing murdered  White woman  Motherfucking  It's nothing worse to me  Than a pretty looking white girl  Killed by a black guy  It fucking destroys me  Patrice  I'll tell you what's worse  When they date them  That's white women's job now  Is to just be murdered  Is murdered and missing  They do nothing in society no more 
[02:31:00]  But she was a proper thin chick as well  Why don't they hunt down the fatties?  Come on  You gotta think they're easy to chase  Really?  They're so much easier  Because black guys like them  He's fucking her  And killing the white models  Let's get back to the Jim Jeffries story  So you had a black eye  I had a black eye  You were engaged  We didn't know you were engaged  Yeah it was on right  And I come home  The flat had been fucking empty  Yeah she went off with a guy  From her fucking work  And that was the last  It's not much of a story  But she was skinny and hot  Did you see it coming?  The punch?  Or the  No  I didn't 
[02:31:30]  So she must have been  Seeing this guy at work  For a while  And you didn't  She's now  She's engaged to a guy  Who's the fucking  Producer of one of the biggest  TV shows in Britain  That I was booked to be on  And then I didn't fucking  Get on the show  Of course you're not  Going to get on the fucking show  It hurt my TV career  My mental health  Oh it wasn't  It wasn't good  You guys  You guys got to get  Circumcised over there  I'm circumcised  I'm Australian  I'm Australian  Yeah I'm circumcised  Okay  Yeah he's sort of circumcised  All Australians are circumcised  Because of the fucking 
[02:32:00]  The wind and the  Sand and shit  It's hot in Australia  It's real  English guys out  They have that sweaty hood  Thing  Oh god  That disgusting  I can't even imagine  You remember my girl  From England  From Liverpool  I had a girlfriend  From Liverpool  She wasn't circumcised  And I pulled my dick out  And she just went  You know they sound like  The Beatles  And she just went  Oh  What your cock sounds  Like the Beatles  She just goes  She just goes  Look at it  It's gorgeous  Because it didn't have 
[02:32:30]  All the skin on it  And she's just like  She's pulling it  And she's like  Does it hurt  When I jerk it  Because she was used  To dealing with  I don't know  Keep doing it  Keep doing it  And she just  Was tired  Looking at those  Fucking awful  Uncircumcised cocks  You've been looking  At her whole life  And it's just  A pretty thing  Over there  If you're circumcised  It's over nuts  Oh if you pull  Your dick out  And it doesn't have  The skin  It's not even  A pretty thing  It's a novelty  Cock for them  It's not a novelty  It's beautiful  You've been sucking  The same type of  Cock every day  Of your life  For 20 odd years 
[02:33:00]  And then you get  One that's got  A head or a face  I don't think  Uncircumcised  Is a novelty  Like  It's just  It's just a better  Dick  I'd rather be uncut  I hate being cut  As long as you  Keep it clean  Oh stop  Why don't you say that  Because your dickhead  Is exposed  What do you think  Nature made a mistake  Putting fucking  Something over it  To keep it from  Rubbing against your underwear  You have a substantially  Less chance of getting  AIDS if you're circumcised  And they've proven it  It's like 50% less chance  Because the countries  They have AIDS  And probably the fucking  Africa  They're not circumcised 
[02:33:30]  Because they live  In those cruddy corners  No no  AIDS died in the fear  The tribes  He's done some research  Timmy has called  Some hotlines  The tribes in Africa  That have got  That get circumcised  Like an entire tribe  That get circumcised  They're like 80% less AIDS  Than the uncircumcised tribes  Maybe because they're  Quote on quote  More in touch with  Modern people  Who knows  But there's nothing  To do with  Four skin and AIDS  Nothing  They're doing it  With fucking a rock  Or something man  We're talking like  Wait a minute 
[02:34:00]  Why not Jim  He just said it  He just said it  Like he's a doctor  Dr. Norton  Like he's been doing  Research in the  Jumbles of Africa  His whole life  How many Jews  Do you know  I know enough about AIDS  They won't get it  Because the medication  Is too expensive  AIDS does not  Fucking hide  Under your force  Do you do know  That AIDS  Is  It's lifespan  Is cut a lot  Shorter  The virus itself  In light  And in  An airy 
[02:34:30]  Atmosphere  It dies  When it hits  Whatever  So you don't think  He fucks in dark alleys  You don't think  In the foreskin  The virus can actually  Live in there  Longer  Wait a minute  Anthony  Could you ask him  He's got actual info  His passion  Hold on  We'll go to  WebMD  Fan  Fan  The article's entitled  The foreskin  Colon  An open door  For HIV  If they say yes 
[02:35:00]  It's going to be  Because they're going  To probably say  Cuts last longer  On a cut  I don't think so  They're saying a cut  That's the case  That's the case  Fan  The foreskin  Of the uncircumcised penis  Is a welcome match  For HIV  According to a new study  Growing consensus  Among health experts  The experts warn  That circumcision alone  Does not protect  The man from being  Infected with HIV  It does however  Greatly reduce 
[02:35:30]  His odds of being infected  How  Jesus  I don't believe it  He's reading it  From WebMD  It's a medical document  Come on  What do you need  It's a new study  They're going to say  New shit  It's a new study  What year was this  2000  It's a new study  It's an eight year old study  Jurassic man  But you're just comparing it  To you  That's right  The hoonest people  In this country  Have made a cover up  Ever since then  I'd take a medical  Like the church 
[02:36:00]  In the da Vinci code  I would rather  I would take a medical  Uncircumcised  Than circumcised  I would take a medical  Fucking journal  From the 1800s  Over just Jimmy talking  I would rather be  Put leeches on your foreskin  To cure AIDS  It really is his own  Like hypothesis  That works for him  Exactly  He's cursing out fan  As he's reading  The medical document  Fuck you fan  And I bet you  They say it's about  Your cut dick  Who cuts their dick  No but a cut  Is how a lot of times  You get transferred  It's blood to blood  That's why it happens 
[02:36:30]  So what are you  Fucking razor blades  What is it  A foreskin made of  Fucking Kevlar  No no no  It would keep something  Maybe from healing  Keep it wet  And I'm speculating  Yes you are  Maybe the other will cut  Under your helmet  Maybe it stays cut  And doesn't heal  As fast under 40 years  He just made up  A medical  That makes sense  He made up a scenario  He made up a scenario  That never happens  He decided that he's  A fucking doctor  When have you cut  Your dick  Fucking  What  When have you cut  Your dick  Fucking  I fucking scraped  It up a little bit  You didn't get a blowjob  That was rough  I can tell you something  Yes I have 
[02:37:00]  Man ass muscles  Is very strong  No I don't buy that  I don't buy it  I cut my dick  I like get abrasions  When I was fucking  Like jacking off  Especially growing up  If you cut it up  For like days  And then you go  Have a wank  I'll injure myself  To blood  Yeah you just  Fucking scrape it up  Pretty good  It has something to do  I think with where  The people who are  Uncircumcised are from  The majority of people  Getting it are probably  From places where  Circumcision is not  Nearly best practice  I'll agree with you there  I bet people that are 
[02:37:30]  Circumcised live in  More civilized nations  Than uncircumcised  People just running around  How about this  Uncircumcised people  They don't circumcise  In England  They just  I know that  We're talking about  Where AIDS is running  Rampant  The continent of Africa  So why is AIDS  Running rampant  In England  Because a lot of  The guys in Africa  Will wear condoms  Because they think  It's a less masculine thing  Maybe they don't have any  There's no corner  There's no 7-Elevens  In fucking boo-boo  You can get that  You can get that  Boo-boo  Have you been  To boo-boo  I've been to boo-boo 
[02:38:00]  Twice  And I was looking  For some fucking rubbers  They called me  A faggot twice  I got it  Fucking pussy  You don't need a rubble  How about  Here's another interesting fact  About foreskin  Facts  What facts  More likely  To make you barefooted  Because a lot of people  A lot of the aborigines  Have foreskin  And they don't have  It's like  It all depends on where you are  Could you ask if  Aboriginal circumcised  Where he's getting  Other than  An emotional attachment  To what he believes 
[02:38:30]  Yeah  Where did he read this  Aboriginal circumcised  They're circumcised  They circumcised  How do they do that  That's a rumour  Where are you getting  Your  Your feet up  Oh they don't  Attachment to this  Because I know  That age is transferred  How would foreskin  Explain to me  I just did  It's because it sits  In the fucking folder  Let's hold on  Dr. Than please  Dr. Than  In a study that was  Performed in Australia  Yeah  That's why he's married to it 
[02:39:00]  They found that  The inner surface  Of the foreskin  But not any other  Outside part of the penis  Is rich in a type of cell  That carries HIV  Directly to the T cells  The cells in which  The virus replicates itself  Wow  That's fucking science  Well if that is accurate  Then I'm wrong  But if  If  You just said  It's one article  You just lost  The fucking doctor  One  One guy  This guy  This guy  This guy  This guy  Who can't loan 
[02:39:30]  Timmy  It's one guy  This one guy  This guy  With a DR  In front of his name  It's one guy  A guy  A guy who's done  Research and experiments  And you  Just  Have a bit of a  Hey  They also  They also thought  They just had a cure  For HIV  And it turned out  To make you more vulnerable  To the fucking virus  So the doctors  Magic doesn't have it anymore  Magic is cured  But I'm saying  They're fucking wrong  Half the time  They're wrong  So one article  Is not going to convince me  That I'm wrong  Magic is cured from AIDS  Magic doesn't  What the fuck 
[02:40:00]  Is the guy's name  He's looking healthy  Go to the fucking website  The guy cured AIDS  He didn't cure AIDS  Fucking  What did he sell his ass  You know who really  The only person who cured it  Was Kevorkian really  I mean  Maybe there's more  Stuff on it  But I've never  Heard that before  In one article  Are you calling magic now  Alright  Let me get  Let me get  Let me get  Let me get  Let me get  Let me get  Corinne from Jersey  What's up  I just have to say  Jimmy  I absolutely love  Your medical knowledge  This study has  No credibility 
[02:40:30]  Because it's too new  And  3000  What's the website  Of the guy  That cured AIDS  Wait what was  The last part  Corinne  God damn it  And you've got  A foot thing on your foot  A foot thing on your foot  Alright fuck it  I'll concede  Dr. Steve just fucking  Texted me  I trust Dr. Steve  He's American  It said uncircumcised  Everybody likes  Sticking fingers up  Guys butts  Nah but I  I'm not  You get some of those  Finger AIDS  I'm not so crazy  That I will look at  All evidence  And say I'm right  I'm not an idiot  Uncircumcised 
[02:41:00]  Is more membrane  Easier to infect  Sorry  And then he goes  I'm driving more later  So okay  Apparently that was why  But I would still  Rather be uncircumcised  Because I'm not  Fucking get  I'm not fucking people  Yeah but why  Why would you  Rather be uncircumcised  Because I think  That your fucking  Dickhead is sensitive  And it's almost like  When you're  When you're watching  A porno movie  A guy who's  Uncircumcised  Getting ready to fuck  Or a girl jerking him off  And that skin  Going over the dickhead  It looks like it feels  A lot better  Than just the hand  Scraping over my dick  That's why there's lube  Motherfucker  That's the whole point 
[02:41:30]  Lube right  But you need lube  I'm saying naturally  You're built that way  You want your skin  Going down and up  Over your dick  Like a fucking  Some turtle  I can't imagine  I can't imagine  And that's why you need lube  I'd rather lube  Than that sweaty  Pink sock  In your own cock  Why does nature  Put fucking foreskin  On your dick  If it's not  To help protect  I don't know  It gave us an appendix  To  Yeah why does it  Give you  A tonsil  We don't need it  One of those  What's the spleen  The spleen's a useless  Piece of shit  The foreskin  Is cut off  For no reason  It keeps you from bleeding  The foreskin  Is just chopped off 
[02:42:00]  For religious reasons  Without the spleen  He's right  It's cut off  For religious reasons  That's it  Why does it give you  Your hair on your big toes  What's the point  You know  Because we were apes  And we're kind of  Fucking getting out of that now  But it takes a while  That's the same thing  You don't just wake up  And not ape  And not ape  We will evolve  Without the foreskin  No we won't  After everyone dies from AIDS  With foreskins  Look at all the hair  That's right  Look at this  All of our fucking hair  Is almost gone  We have a few on the toes  And knuckles  And the foreskin  Is still fucking hanging good  What?  The foreskin hasn't budged 
[02:42:30]  No he hasn't  Dr. S-E-B-I  Cured AIDS  Exactly  When you gotta spell his name out  He's cured nothing  Dr. Sebi  S-I-B-I  He invented  He cured AIDS  Sibi  He's the guy  That cured magic man  Yes sir  They didn't cure  Magic doesn't have AIDS anymore  So why do people have AIDS then  Magic stopped taking his medication  And fucking started  Getting ill again  And had to take his medication  Oh you shit me  Magic did get cocky  You think  I'm okay  And he stopped taking his cocktail  Because he's a fucking athlete  He's in perfect  Cocky cocktail 
[02:43:00]  Cocktail  You know  He stopped taking his cocktail  Really  Cock in the tail  I'm wrong about the foreskin  And the age apparently  But I'll still take foreskin  Somebody has a very good question  Red Bank  We go to John  John what's up  Hey Jimmy  Why are you holding on to this  Did you get fucked by a training  With an uncircumcised cock  Last night  You know sir  That's very hurtful  No  That's bad  The reason I was holding on to  Is because my original point  Was that I would like  To still have foreskin  It annoys me 
[02:43:30]  That I'm fucking circumcised  That's ridiculous  So he gives a fuck  That's ridiculous  You have a better dick  Without the skin  Let's go to Moose  It's aesthetics  But there's nothing medical about it  Moose in Tennessee  Moose  Of course Moose is a doctor  Yeah Moose  What's up  I was watching  Penn and Teller's bullshit  On Showtime  The other night  Yeah  They had a study on that  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  It's just  There's a very good observation  Going on  We got Jim Jeffreys  In the studio 
[02:44:00]  That has quite an accent  And he's sitting there  Just belly laughing  Over Moose's accent  Is that Dr. Phil  Or something  Like fuck it  I was watching  Penn and Teller  The other day  Oh fucking hell  Half your country  Sounds like  Fucking spastics  Fair dinkum  What type of voice  Is that  Anyway  Let him ask his question  I'll just  Let's just enjoy  This guy from Jeffreys  No  But I come from  A different country  This is internal  Well  No Tennessee  Is kind of  A different country 
[02:44:30]  I would love  To Penn and Teller  Go ahead Moose  Moose  It might as well  Be a different country  But on there  They were showing  That there were  Three or four studies  Done on the foreskin  And AIDS thing  And it's  Completely bullshit  Okay  I just love  How Jim's laughing  They were talking  About the AIDS thing  Oh my god  So let me tell you  About that AIDS thing  The foreskin  And all  What  How do you get rid 
[02:45:00]  Of the AIDS  If you have a foreskin  So you're saying  That Penn and Teller  Is bullshit  Which is actually  A good show  They did a study  A bunch of studies  And they're saying  That the foreskin  Connection is bullshit  Some people  Some doctors believe it  Some don't I guess  I still trust  Dr. Steve's judgment  What does Penn have a foreskin  And Teller doesn't  They both fucked the chick  With AIDS  And they both got it  Hey Moose  Thank you  Alright  Alright  We'll see you later  Now I believe it  Now I believe it  Because Moose said it  I believe it  I want it to be right  Because I'm cut 
[02:45:30]  People just believe  Thank you sir  People just believe  Anything that they want  To believe  On their side  Of the argument  Because he just goes  See I told you  Penn and Teller  What  No I'm not saying that  I'm saying that  He just read a fucking thing  From MD  This website  People go to that website  When they think  They have something  Right  Like they go  Oh my god  My eyes hurt  My fucking asshole  Is itching  And they'll tell you  What the fuck you got  And you go to the doctor  And they'll tell you  You have what that  Fucking medical  That thing  With the WebMD  That fucking WebMD  Is  Fuck that  You should never  You have a simple call 
[02:46:00]  The next thing you start  Reading about horrific things  That you're going to have  Yeah  The fucking  And have them  There's not conclusive evidence  That's why  If you're going to hear  Different points  If half are saying this  And half are saying that  Then I'm not going to  I believe the half  That says what I want  Alright listen  Sean from Columbus writes  Has Moose previously called  Jimmy Dean  To complain  Got some Jimmy Dean  Sausage  My sausage  My sausage  Sausages  Uh Rich  Georgia  What's up  Hey Jimmy  Yes sir  Disagree to disagree 
[02:46:30]  And then you win  Yeah  What about that Jimmy  Yeah  I have no real  But I don't have  Any vested interest  Then you don't win  Then he's just admitting  People want to acknowledge  That Anthony does a great  Mike grudge  Then you give an email  Very good  I have no vested interest  In foreskin  I don't have it  I'm just saying  I wish I did  No vested interest  How many shares  Do you hold  In foreskin  I don't have a  I don't have a  Fucking big goopy hanger  I have a fucking  Great looking dick  How many fucking  He's a vested interest  He's trading in foreskins  He owns me own shares  I know  As soon as he came out 
[02:47:00]  Sell the foreskins  You know foreskins  Foreskins  Will you make  Bacon  Lettuce  Tomato sandwiches  Yeah  What else can we do  With them  No one's buying  I don't know  Put them on the end  Of fingerless gloves  Maybe  Sell them as calamari rings  Oh god  Fuck me man  That's calamari  Is that disgusting  You really have a problem  With uh  You really  Like you're just saying  That to be controversial  No I'm not  Not at all  Why would I  I want my foreskin 
[02:47:30]  Here's what the problem  Is with Jimmy  I'll profile  I'll profile you  I'll profile Jim  Right now  About this foreskin thing  Jim is so into  Uh uh  Sex and his dick  And feeling good  You just want  Something different  To see if it's better  No  So you fantasize  About having a foreskin  Thinking that would make  Fucking feel better  If you have a foreskin  Your dick  It just has to be  A little bit more sensitive  Of the head of your dick  Why does it have to  Because it's protected  You have something  Like your dick  I was on the fucking 
[02:48:00]  Elliptical machine  How much sensitive  Do I need it to be  And you're on the elliptical  And my fucking  No no no  My dick is rubbing  Against my fucking  Uh  My uh  My boxers  While I'm on the elliptical  Because of the way I'm walking  It's like if you have a foreskin  That at least protects you  A little bit  From that fucking rubbing  Let's go to the fact  That women  Fucking hate that  It smells good  Well you gotta be clean  But your asshole  Could smell bad  If you don't  A lot of women  Won't eat ass  Because a guy's asshole  Smells like onions  A lot of women  Won't eat ass  Just in period  But  My ass is in shocking shape  I got piles and blood 
[02:48:30]  And all rubbish  Coming out of my ass  Oh fuck  My house is in such  Well you motherfuckers  Eat fried everything  Over in your  Over in  No I'm not  I'm Australian  I'm Australian  I live in London  But I'm Australian  How dare you stereotype  The Scottish people  They eat fried candy bars  They eat scots  They eat fried snickers  And they even eat fried  Deep fried pizza  Food in England is horrid  Man it's a horrid thing  England's better than Scotland  Scotland's fucking right  Scotland  Scotland's terrible  A lot of sheep  Fuck the queen  Love those guys 
[02:49:00]  Fuck the queen  Fuck the queen  We got a good call  Coming in here  From Canada  Let's say hi to Dan  Dan what's up  Hey this is  Actually Dan  Alright  Well whatever  I would say that  I have a  I have a poor skin too  And that  Well I guess two  Neither one of you guys  Have a  But the thing is  That when I was growing up  Like you learned to  Masturbate easier  And it does feel a lot better  Like  How do you know  What do you complain to  How do you know  How do you know  Have you masturbated  Another cock  Thank you for that  So the thing is 
[02:49:30]  So you pull it back  And you can hide  The fact you have  A foreskin or not  I dated whole girls  Who didn't know  And you can actually  Get these  When you get a blowjob  And from a girl  Who does it right  The whole body goes numb  Because your dickhead  Isn't sticking out  All the time  Mine does too  Asshole  Yeah  Do you think  I'm just orgasming  And going  Just going  Oh god  Oh blowjobs suck  Because I don't have  A foreskin  Boy I wish this was better  And then you  I don't want  To just feel better  Your cum gets stuck  In your little hood  Yeah  You cum is fucking  You peel it back 
[02:50:00]  When you're done  And fucking peel  The potato flakes  And then you have  Potato flakes  And then you have  The potato flakes  On your calamari  You have to fucking  You have to fucking  Think  You have to think  About coming  Like you have to go  Okay I gotta hold  My awful skin back  With my left hand  And jerk with my right hand  So it doesn't  Fucking time it right  Like a sliding roof  So when I cum  It doesn't shoot  All the way down  On my sneakers  It might cum  Doesn't ricochet  But how do you  Need it to feel  If they make it 
[02:50:30]  Start feeling better  I will  I'll just stop  Thinking about rape  And do it  I just think  It would feel better  If you had something  You think  You don't know  It's common sense  No  Why does the clit  Have a hood  Why not take the clit hood off  It's to keep the sensitivity  But does the clit have a hood  Yes it does  Someone's saying  You can get foreskin  Added  Jimmy  A little piece of skin over  Jimmy  It's just a flap  We can solve your problem  Someone's saying  You can get foreskin back  I'm not  Putting weights on my dick  I'm not that fucking married  Is that how they do it  Yes  Yeah they fucking stretch 
[02:51:00]  Your skin around your dick  With weights  Yeah it's awful  No shit I saw it on TV  I mean your ankles fucking tight  And stupid  There's no reason for it  Do this then  Wear a fucking condom  All the time  For a month  No  Just as you walk around  Put a condom on it  And leave your dickhead uncovered  And then fucking see  If it feels better  That's different  No it isn't  Condoms fucking awful  Plant with chemicals in it  I want one  With fucking nature  Get a natural one  The clit does have  A little piece of skin over it  Okay then walk around  Docked to a gay guy  For a month  With his foreskin 
[02:51:30]  Over your head  Or your dick  I know  Just making eye contact  The whole time  But Norton  You pull the foreskin  Back on a clip  To lick it  Yes  So what is your point  Because it's protected  When the skin is over it  Protected  It's got a whole lot  From rubbing  From abrasions  But it's rubbing the skin  The skin  The skin is like  Kind of soft and moist  Underneath it  What do you think  I'm wearing concrete underwear  What the fuck  To wear soft cotton undies  No why else  Why else would something  Sensitive like that  Be protected by skin  It's fucking nature 
[02:52:00]  Because we didn't have clothes  There was a time  We didn't have clothes  There you go  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  OB gets a gold star  In class today  No  I'll tell you why  Because we  That's another reason  That we have less hair  Is because we don't  Fucking need it anymore  Because we wear clothes  Why is the foreskin  Not gone  It is going  It is receding  No it's not  It is receding  That's the same medical fact  I have a receding foreskin  Where did you hear that  Go check receding  I got a rubber  Rogaine on my  Foreskin  Foreskin's not receding  I remember when I was a kid 
[02:52:30]  The foreskins were way bigger  You can pick up a peanut with it  You just gotta look around  You just gotta look around  It's common sense  Feed it to your asshole  Look around  When I was a boy scout  Every foreskin I saw  Were much bigger than  Yeah  That's just a lie  It's just a lie  Every priest I saw  Every priest I saw  Every unclipped  Delicious cock  Even the rabbis  Had big foreskins  That's how bad it was  Back in the day  Why don't we take a break  Foreskins are not going anywhere  They're making a comeback actually  Nothing  Yeah a lot of people 
[02:53:00]  Won't do it anymore  It's fucking barbaric  No it is not  It's old school foreskins  It's fucking civilized  You know what  I'm challenging everything  Norton says  You can but I'm  Why  Where did you  Where did you get that information  That foreskins are making  A fucking comeback  Because people  A lot of people  Are less likely to  I'll tell you what  Who's a lot of people  I've read a lot of stuff  About people who don't want  To circumcise their kids  Just give me one  No I'll tell you why  Because it's barbaric  Because certain elements  Of a society  Are growing at a faster rate  Than others  That don't circumcise  Muslims  No no no no 
[02:53:30]  Hispanics  They're  They're in this  Yes  They're reproducing  Faster than white people  As the myths  No no  What I've read about it  Is as the myths  Of the foreskin  Causing cancer  There's like all those myths  That it's more likely  To get cancer  If you have foreskin  Myths  It's only aesthetics  It's aesthetics  It's just like  Your dick is pretty  There's no medical reason  There's no reason for it  There's no reason for it  So people are like  Why would you do that to a kid  Does it traumatize a kid  To fucking cut the tip  Of his dick off  For no reason  There is a reason  It's clean  Get out of here  Old pussy dick 
[02:54:00]  But there is reasons  It's cleaner  You don't get aged  Your fucking dick  With labias  If you clean your dick  You're fine  Sometimes you can't  Clean your dick  Let's say you're  You're going camping  For a week  It's very hard  To keep your dick  I know  My dick starts to smell  If I've been in my car  For six hours  Right  You know that little thing  Between your ball sack  And your leg  I watch my dick  With a gopher  If I had to  I have to keep 
[02:54:30]  Candice  Do you have Candice  In that antifungal shit  That women use  On Crush  I've got  The trip between  My ball sack  And my leg  You know you shove  Your finger down  And sniff it  That's rank as fuck  Man  And I can't imagine  If that was around  Holy shit  If that was around  The head of my cock  And I get that  On a monthly basis  And I'm fighting  A war against smell  I don't get that  I'm fucking  It's different  How about women  Clip their pussy lips  Because they can get smelly  It's like  It's the same thing  Women with fleshy  Meaty pussies  Are they supposed to  Clip their lips 
[02:55:00]  So it doesn't stink  You gotta keep it clean  Ideally  But you know  That the pussy  And the vagina  Are exactly  Like the same  Thing going on  Pussy and the vagina  Yeah they're the same thing  Pussy and the vagina  Yeah yeah yeah  They're the same  No I'm not saying  Yeah yeah yeah  You said that  Yeah you know  Cunts are the same as well  Pussy and vagina  Are a cunt  I meant to add  Dicking it somewhere  Twats are the same  A cunt is what  A pussy and vagina  Are on  I mean it's  It's all the same shit man  That's what I'm saying  It's just like  The lips and the hood  You don't need  None of that stupid shit  I'm getting the feeling  That Jimmy likes foreskin 
[02:55:30]  No I just wish  I had it man  I'm not getting the feeling  He likes it  I think he loves it  If anyone's out there  Who is getting a child  Circumcised  In the next couple of days  Can you put that ring  Into an envelope  And send it to the radio station  So that Jimmy can have one  In a jar  You're cutting the fucking  Tip of your kid's dick  With a fucking sharp instrument  For no reason  So girls don't laugh at them  It's a reason  I want to take a break  That's a wonderful  It's just silly 
[02:56:00]  We're all circumcised  We've talked about our cocks  For an hour  Yeah exactly  Now let's touch them  Come on  We've talked about  Other men's cocks  I have talked about  My thrush  You have AIDS  Yes you have AIDS  I hate to tell you boy  That you have AIDS  You've got the AIDS  You may have caught it  When you stuck  That filthy needle in here  Or maybe all that  Unprotected sex  But you hear  It isn't clear  But what we're certain of  Is you have AIDS  Yes you have AIDS  Not HIV 
[02:56:30]  But full blown AIDS  Be sure that you see  That this is not HIV  But full blown AIDS  Not HIV but really full blown AIDS  I'm sorry I wish it was something less serious  But it's AIDS  You've got the AIDS 
[02:57:00]  Goofy gags to plan your uncircumcised pals  Funny things to do with foreskin  One was you put fucking a little crazy glue around the rim  And you put it around an exhaust pipe  The foreskin  And you drive away  Fucking pull the skin aside  And dump rock salt in there  Clean that out you fucking baboon cock  One was itching powder  And the fucking thing  And then you staple it shut on top  Dirty fucking geropedic  You stand a fucking uncut guy against the wall  And you lay on your back 
[02:57:30]  You put your feet on his thighs  And you grab his foreskin with both hands  And you pull it up to your chest  And you let it snap like a window shade  And it will actually make the noise  I have to fill that skinny fucking  Fleshy pouch with crushed glass  And then fucking smash my fist  Goofy gags to plan your uncircumcised pals  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Hit the bricks, crusader dick  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?

[02:59:00]  This is Wyo Dirt  Wyo Dirt  What's up, buddy?  Hey  Calling the show yesterday  And I just talked to a producer  And  You know  He's calling me a 12-year-old  Saying I act like a 12-year-old  I, of course, kept calling  And on one of the calls  He said that he's got my phone number  And he read it to me  Which, of course, it was my number  He has caller ID  And he said he's gonna call the cops  And the local authorities  Are gonna come visit me  Oh, they're resorting to that gag?  You can call a radio station 
[02:59:30]  As many times as you want  Whenever the guy  The screener goes  I got your number  And I'm gonna call the authorities  Do you think the cops  Actually are gonna go  Oh, you're a radio station  And people are calling the station  And you want us to go over there  And arrest the guy?  Yeah  Well, the guy started out  By calling him a 12-year-old, too  So that's wonderful  Yeah, that's gonna deter our listeners  It gets better than that  Five minutes later  I get a phone call  From an unknown number  So I'm thinking  I know where this is going 
[03:00:00]  Sure enough  The producer's calling me  And now he's acting  Like a 12-year-old  I brought him down to our level  How funny is that?  I got  That's all I got, guys  Punch him out  Thank you  Very funny, man  Oh, they're trying to fight back  How cute  We're gonna move on  But first  We got a guy  Steve, Canada  Got circumcised  We want to move on from this  But this is too good  He got circumcised  That's all right  At the age of 28 years old  Oh, my God, man  Steve, what's up? 
[03:00:30]  Not much  Just listened to the show  And thought I'd call in  And let Jimmy know  Yeah, it was better before  Of course it was better before  You didn't have  You remember being circumcised  I don't remember being circumcised  Therefore it wasn't traumatic  Yeah  Did it hurt?  I'm saying Jimmy  You have an actual memory  Of getting your dick cut up  Dude  So it felt  You were saying before  I had no relative comparison  No, that is fair  That is fair  I will concede on that  Yes, that is fair  Did it hurt like fuck, mate? 
[03:01:00]  How bad was it?  Or were you out?  How bad was it?  Yeah  Oh, it fucking hurt  Yeah  Why'd you have it done?  I had two medical reasons  I had  Ah, okay  Something called  Ballinitis  Which can happen  And what's that?  What's that, sir?  Say again?  What is it?  Ballinitis?

You're fucking ass  No, this is  This is exactly what I mean, dude  Get rid of that dirty shit  I eat yeast infections for breakfast  What's wrong with you, Steve?  I got a story, right?  I talk about this on stage bit, right?  I fucking  I had a small little lump  On the side of my cock  When I was at the Edinburgh Festival 
[03:02:00]  Right?  And I go to the doctor  And the doctor looked at her  Shame  Shame  Sorry, I'm button-happy today  And the doctor looked at her  And he sent me off to a specialist  They put my dick into like a clamping machine  And it turned out I had a small tumorous growth  Growing on the side of my cock  Right?  Like dick cancer  Right?  And a fucking  Six stitches later  They cut the bastard out  But because  I'd been cheating  I'd been cheating on my girlfriend  The one that left me  I'd been cheating on the  During the Edinburgh Festival  I'd been cheating on her  When I went to the doctor  I think I'm the first person ever 
[03:02:30]  To high-five a doctor  When he says you've got cancer  I was well up for that  Because if I had like  Herpes or something  I would have been in the world of shit  But cancer  She was making me cake and stuff  Where was the lump?  It was just on the side of the  Oh, I'm appointing  It was on the right-hand side of the shaft  And they just fucking  How big was it?  It was like  Like a hundred and thousand  It was like just  But it was a solid little  Solidified piece of shit  And they cut it out  Like put stitches into my cock  And told me not to get an erection  For three weeks 
[03:03:00]  Or you'll pop a stitch  Yeah  And fucking  I didn't wank or nothing  For like three weeks  And try not to sleep  And it was pretty hard going  Wow  Can you take Salpeter  Or something like that  Would that help?  What's that?  Salpeter  What's Salpeter?  You give it to you in jail  Or in the military  To keep your dick getting hard  Oh, no, no  I just fucking  I just  Jimmy throws everything  Jimmy throws these things out  Everything  From like the  1900s  The early 1900s  Wait, everyone be honest  Salpeter  We got six in the room  Who else knew  What Jimmy was talking about? 
[03:03:30]  I knew what he was talking about  But it's something that  Like I don't think  Is practiced anymore  They didn't give me  Any Salpeters  My comeback wank  Was something to behold  Though  After the stitches came out  After three weeks  Of not fucking pulling me  So  It had teeth in it  When I  I'm telling you  There was some solid old cum  Falling out of my cock  Hey, I did not forget  By the way  The show continues  When we go to break  And uh  Well, uh  Jim Jeffries admitted  That he likes snowballing 
[03:04:00]  That is a fucking gay thing  I don't like snowball  I just don't have a problem with it  You've done it  When you say you've snowballed  I've done it many times  You  What's the definition of snowballing  Kissing  Kissing a fucking woman  With your own  After you cum in her mouth  Yep  She kisses you  With your cum in her mouth  That's it  And you swap it  That's snowballing  That's fucking gay  I've done it  I've done it  I've done it where  Norton is saying it's not gay  And Jeffries is not saying  Wow  I've done it not even kissing  Where they've stood above me  And spit it down my mouth 
[03:04:30]  That's not gay  That's not gay  That's gay  It's gay  Sometimes I like to humiliate  Cause that's like  You cum in your own mouth  Would you do it with someone else's cum  No I wouldn't do it with someone else's cum  That to me would be gay  Someone else's cum would be gay  I wouldn't do it with someone else's cum  Norton  Have you ever gone down the girl  Where you've cum inside her  And then gone down on her  No  You've snowballed the cum  You've snowballed the cum  You ever eat your own boogers  But you wouldn't eat somebody else's  First of all  You just tried to trick me  By saying I did something  That you didn't ask me about  I said did you ever eat your own boogers  I didn't answer yet  No  But it's a speculative question  I don't eat my own 
[03:05:00]  I never ate my own anything  No  If there's spit in my mouth  That  Or if I  I gotta spit it out  Really  I have to spit it out  Oh I don't  No I just swallow it back  There you go  But that comes from two snowballers  We got a lot of reports coming in  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station  Snowballing is 100% gay  No it's not  It's not gay  Absolutely  I remember being like a 40 year old boy  And coming to my hand  Both of you gay gyms  Ew  More importantly  No I think it's close  I don't know what it tastes like  Hold on we're out of something here 
[03:05:30]  More importantly  I want to ask Jim  How does it feel to meet your clone  I never snowballed  But you two are very similar  The Australian doppelganger  Shade the same  Fucking same thing  Snowballing  This is like the Australian version of Norton right here  No I don't  I'm not saying you snowballed  But you guys have very similar tastes  Yeah but I prefer to have a circumcised cock  It's like bizarro Norton  Yeah  But it's fucking  I've done some filthy sexual things  Snowballing to me was always just gross  Like my girlfriend has kissed me  Like after she's blown me 
[03:06:00]  Even pecking  There's nothing  It's horrible  I've felched man  I'll put any  Any  He's into humiliation  That's all  Any juicy pussy shit  Hold on a second  The guy just admitted that he's felched  You suck cum out of a girl's ass you fucked  Yeah  Yeah  You're cum  That's gay man  I've been  That is so  It's gay man  I've been wasted man  I'm just fucking  And I'm not  I'm only judging it cause it's fucking gay  Like it's  It's a gay thing to do  That is so fucking  If you admit it  Hold on  How many millions of people 
[03:06:30]  Hold on  And my mum will never hear it  She's just going to me  Nah  You gotta walk us through the felching  Like give us some details  What's so bad  You're already licking out where she shits from  Why not add a bit of coving  You're not  But first of all  See  The thing is  About ass  About ass licking  The asshole  The anus is not where she  The shit is in the lower intestines  The asshole is  Licking the asshole  It's a  Come on  Come on  Licking the asshole 
[03:07:00]  Is a  I don't mind licking the asshole  It is not clean  We live our whole lives  We have a piece  We don't wash our hands  We do a shit  There's shit smit everywhere  We dry it off with a bit of paper  And go  That's clean enough for me  And then we lick the fucking thing  No  She take a shower  Oh we don't waste the paper  For what  If you take a shower  But felching do anything  But your own cum  Does felching though  Use any straws or anything  No  I'm not sick  Would you lick  I'm not sick  I'm not crazy  And it wasn't like I was going 
[03:07:30]  And now my dear  The felching begins  It was just like  I've been fucking  You break out a crazy straw  I'm licking a cum again  I go lick her ass  I'm a bit of cum  I'll lick it out  Jim  If you came on her stomach  Would you think it's gay  To come on her stomach  And then lick it off her stomach  No  I've never done that  But I wouldn't think it's gay  Not gay  I've never done it  Humiliation is different  Than gay  Gay is wanting another man  Someone spitting your own  No  I'm telling you  Somebody spitting your own  Cum in your mouth  Which to me is not my thing  I've never done it  I wouldn't do it 
[03:08:00]  You're getting the taste  Of a man's  Fucking product  In your mouth  Even though it's your  Humiliation  Yeah but it's still  The same chemical composition  As any man's  Have you ever kept cum in your own hand  And licked your cum out of your hand  Before I had sex  I had done that  Because I wanted to know  What it tastes like  Jim is gay  Jim Jeffries is a sissy  It's not like  I ate it  I just thought  How many cocks  And you know what makes me  How many cocks do you take  Before you call it gay  I bet you Simon Kyle's a sissy too  I have never touched  I have never touched a cock 
[03:08:30]  With my hands  But there's been like  A spit roast  Where my cock is rubbed  Against another man's cock  He's gay  Why won't anybody join me  I don't think he is  Jim is gay  I'm not gay  He's rubbed his dick  Off someone  I've never done that  If you rubbed it  I'm talking like  Fucking a chick  Yeah  Fucking a chick  Like if a girl's sucking  Two cocks at once  That's the most gay thing  I've ever done  That's absolutely gay  Because that is a fucking excuse  To have your dick  Just because the bitch's mouth 
[03:09:00]  Is the receptacle  But he was a friend of mine  Somebody's dick  Take the girl out of the mix  And you're just rubbing dicks  Yes  Oh yeah  Take the girl  Yeah yeah  So all the way  Hey hey hey  Oh no wait  Oh Anthony wait a minute  Let me just say this  Let me just say  Before I forget  Before I forget  What you just said  It makes a lot of sense  Oh my god  It's all the gayness  Is in context  Yeah yeah  Of a girl  I'm gonna lick my cum  I'm gonna rub balls  I'm gonna do all kind of juicy shit 
[03:09:30]  With my own insides  But there's a bitch involved  That makes it not gay  It's a publicity stunt  That's like saying  Having sex with a woman  If you take the woman away  And put a man there  It's fucking gay  It is  You can't just  Take people out of the equation  A strap-on  A strap-on's not gay  Getting fucked with a strap-on's not gay  It's an absolutely  No it's not  Crackity shit  Are you out of your fucking mind  No it's not  You've never had a girl  Strap a cock on  And fuck you out of the ass  No not even ever  And she's wanking you  I've never even had a bitch 
[03:10:00]  Go fingernail deep in my ass  Oh my god  Patrice  Hold on  I was with Patrice until then  But when we start talking about  The strap-ons  These phones will fucking  Light up with guys  That say that it's not gay  And that they've done it many times  It's not  It's amazing  I didn't know that  Why isn't a fucking woman  With a  Virtual dick  In your asshole  Not gay  What makes it gay  Is if the strap-on looks like a cock  If it looks like anything else 
[03:10:30]  Then it's not gay  No it's humiliation  It's all about a woman  Do you believe that Opie?  If it's a strap-on giraffe  Or something  It's not gay  Do you believe that?  If it looks like a fist  Right  If it looks like a fist  A girl's fist  A girl's fist  I mean a girl's fist  If it sits on your face  It doesn't make you a chair  If it's like a fist  And it's got an engagement ring  But if you're getting  If you're getting  If a strap-on  If a girl puts a strap-on  Alright wait  Can I ask  If a girl puts on a strap-on  And fucks you in the ass  It's humiliation  No  I'll tell you what  No  Dude I almost had it 
[03:11:00]  I couldn't go through it  It's not humiliation  It feels awesome  A dominatrix one time  Doing it to me  And she was staring me in the face  She was fucking staring me in the face  And called you a faggot  No  I couldn't  I couldn't do it  Because it hurt  But it was about this woman  With these beautiful tits  Being so perverse  I didn't think  Wow I wish that was a guy's cop  It was nothing to do with it  It was her  She turned me on  However you rationalize it  I'll tell you  But I didn't do it  Because it hurt  If any girls out there  That would like to date a guy  That does all the things  That I do  Please 
[03:11:30]  Please email the station  Or men  Any men that want to date him  I'm pretty  I want to go backwards a little bit  Because you said  You know  It was a friend of yours  So immediately  I was thinking of Anthony  And I'm like  Oh Jesus  No no no  No no no  Here me out  We're not close  You have to call me  Trust me  He wasn't there  Anthony trust me  We're on the same page  So we're friends  Could you imagine  We have  No  Thank you  No  Thank you  No don't even say it  One girl's mouth  One girl's sucking  Both our cocks 
[03:12:00]  And both of you  First of all  Even being around  Another motherfucker  Okay  Take the sexuality out of it  Your dick is just  In the vicinity  Of my dick  That's why  That's the problem  I have with swinging  The one thing  Is just the  If we swing  And swap  It's the  It's the dick  Get your dick out of here  You take  You take the dick out of it  Only women like anything  That has to do with a dick  Men shouldn't like anything  That has to do with a dick 
[03:12:30]  And I'm not even being  A fucking homophobe  I'm just saying  Dicks are not a pleasurable  Looking thing  But you grab your own dick  What's the difference  Put that on the other guy  Is masturbating gay  Because it's a man's hand  On your cock  You jerk off  You're giving sexual pleasure  To a cock  Look if you can convince me  Shurping off is gay  But I'm saying  You're gay  You're gay  Because I jerk off  With your big manly hand  On your feminine cock  I don't think that's being gay  But if you can tell me  That's being  I'm not gonna  Put it this way  I'm not gonna stop saying 
[03:13:00]  Felchin and Snowball is gay  If jerking off is gay  Then we are all gay  But you're also gayer  No  You can't be gayer  You're either gay  Or you can't be gayer  There's no one  You could be gayer  Jerking off is gay  Felchin is super gay  Jerking off is not gay  Do you have a girl  Put a finger up your ass  Who hasn't  She gave it a try  Didn't like it  Okay  Not a fan of that  You're the most heterosexual man 
[03:13:30]  In the world  Or you don't have a prostate gland  No  No  I just  You know what it is  It's just  The penetration  It just feels funny  Like you know what  This should not be happening  In my ass  Alright what about  It's a violation  It's a strange thing  If you fuck a girl in the ass  That would be gay  By your definition  No  I enjoy woman ass fucking  I enjoy woman's asses  Men and women  Both have asses  You know  So you're fucking  A woman's ass  It's not like  She's got a cock too  And she's used to  Being the fucky 
[03:14:00]  Women  Everything about a woman  Is going inside  Her mouth  Her asshole  Her ears  Yeah so the second  Something's going inside you  You are taking on  The feminine role  I'm just saying  You can argue that  Everything's  Something goes inside you  You're taking on  How about guys that get tied up  Guys that get tied up  And trampled  And stepped on  It's all about humiliation  That's humiliation  I'll give you that  All of it is  May I say normally  My sex is pretty standard  They're humiliated gaming  These are isolated incidences  These are isolated  He's saying his sex  Is pretty standard 
[03:14:30]  These are isolated incidents  Like this isn't like  Tuesday  Everything  Every day  Right  You're fucking  Sucking cum  Out of your  Some chick's asshole  Sometimes the sex  Is relatively normal  A punch here  A slap here  A cut  Is this a bunch of people  On here  Opie  Who fucking enjoy  Felching  No no  Not  Well  Phones are lit though  I'll tell you that  We'll go through those  In a second  There's a song by  King Missal  That'll solve the argument  Someone is saying  Have you ever heard  It  Gay  Where is it  God damn it 
[03:15:00]  A King Missal song  Called Gay  Not Gay  Someone is saying  If you play this song  It'll solve the argument  I'm sure that's a fucking  Band member writing in  Yeah because rock bands  They have all the answers  Exactly  Alright well let's go to this guy  We're gonna  You know we do play  You know what  This is perfect  We do play a game on this show  Called Gay or Funny  Or Gay  We can change it to  Gay or not gay  Yeah fine  Alright because people now have  Things that they're calling up about  Fucking trannies isn't gay  Alright let's go to  No no fucking trannies is gay  No it's not

[03:18:00]  Your dick  Which is a dick  That's the same as saying  If you put your hand on it  You wouldn't put a man's hand on it  What's the difference  It's your hair  Do you like your nipples licks  Do you like your nipples licks  I'm too busy swallowing cum for that  I like my nipples licked  But I'm not  I've never lifted up  To lick my own nipples  That's gay  You think that's gay  You lick your own nipples  No because it wouldn't turn me on  To do so  But I don't think  I can't do it  I don't get  I don't get nipple play man  Like Jimmy loves that 
[03:18:30]  Do you rub your nipples  Do you jerk them off  Dude I can't  I can't jerk off unless there's a woman licking my nipples  This is not a bitch around licking my nipples  It's not even a feeling  It's watching a girl  Without licking my nipples  If I'm to pitch your nipples right now  Is that gay  Yes  Yeah a little bit  Oh no  The context  If it's just fucking  You playing  You keep your homosexuality to yourself  Jim Jeffers  I just like this fight man  Jim  If he's being honest  Now you've got too  Jim is gay  I really don't want to do that  I really don't want to do that  This is what I've said 
[03:19:00]  You just disassociated on this show  That makes everybody open  Jim is a sissy  I don't think he's gay  Maybe not a sissy  But he's definitely a pofter  A pofter  He's got fucking  He's got shame  He's a fucking  He's filled with shame  And fucking  That's a shame thing  He should be  Because he eats cum out of women  He should be filled with shame  I don't eat other men's cum  There might be some residue  From the night before  But mostly standard  It's just my cum  It's mostly yours  During the spit roast  There wasn't two loads of cum  I didn't felch during the spit roast 
[03:19:30]  It's not gay  If you don't know  You're eating another man's cum  I don't know  I don't know about that  If you don't know  In God's eyes it's gay  You know when you  He's going out for a piece  Don't touch your own cock  You queer  I just want to know one thing  What about felching is normal  But adding a straw to it  Makes it weird  No no no no  I just don't like  Because once I had a  Because it's just in the moment  If you just go down there  And look at girls' eyes in the moment  If I have a straw ready  That makes it a little silly  It makes it a little bit 
[03:20:00]  You know  A spoon  I would give you a spoon  A teaspoon  Yeah  Let's see how to Eric  Heat it up like heroin  And shoot it into my veins  Brooklyn  What's up Eric  What's doing guys  Hey  Listen for the past hour  I've been hearing nothing but cum  And dick  You guys are all fucking fairies  I guess we're all gay  Yeah  Hey I'm fucking fairies  You gotta cover different  Alright  I wish  I wish that would turn me on  Because I'm such a fucking pervert  A girl spit my own  Cum in my mouth  I would love to have a new avenue  To go down  Really  It just doesn't do anything for 
[03:20:30]  I don't want to lick her pussy  After I fuck  It's not a major thing  For me  I'm just saying I've done it  A couple of times  It's not one of my things  You do know you guys need to hang out right  I don't want to  Not for the sex  Not to have sex with each other  But you guys have a lot  I do know that my agent  Was considering me being a support  For you too  I think this could be a marriage  Made in heaven  I have  Got into very disgusting areas  Sexually  Very  How far are you going  What's the worst  Well what's the worst  That you can think of  I'm just  Swimming  Come out of girls 
[03:21:00]  Okay look  Look  Jimmy's willing to play  But he's going about this slowly  Just curious  He's not tipping his hand  He's not going all in yet  We've got two poker faces  Going on here  I've already told you  I've had my cock  Touching another man's cock  Shoved into a girl's mouth  While making her say  That she's a slut  With two cocks in her mouth  So that she mumbles it  That's about as bad  As I've really  And I've eaten my own  Come out of a girl's asshole  That's nasty  Anything else you want to put on the table  I'm trying to think  Of something else  That would be  Oh there's a girl  That used to like to be cut 
[03:21:30]  But that wasn't me  That's what she was into  And just like little  Like razors that you cut up coke with  And just slashing her shoulder blades  Holy fuck  That's the worst  That wasn't me  I don't like doing that  It's not gay  That's not gay  But that doesn't make him a Puerto Rican  Jimmy you asked  Now Jimmy you asked  Jim Jeffries  I should have got more  I didn't hear you  Are you  You want a counter now  Or  I've never had my own  Cuma in my mouth  Not my thing  Piz would you do Piz  I've pissed on a girl  Yeah  No I would not 
[03:22:00]  Let it go  Pissed in my mouth  But that's  Just hygiene problems  That I have  It's a personal thing  Not a bad thing  I wouldn't  I wouldn't  I don't have a problem  Would you take a load  On your chest  Yes  No  No shit  No shit  No one shit  No shit  It's not gonna happen  I don't have a problem  With it  I've watched the porn  I watched two girls  One cup with you guys  Enjoyed it  Had a good time  But no  No shit  Is gonna be involved  Like two girls one cup  Just didn't bother me  That made me laugh 
[03:22:30]  Really  That made me draw a wretch  Two girls one cup  Now when you talk about  Being a creep  Two girls one cup  Turned me on  Because of watching  Two beautiful girls  Just be that cruddy  I don't need them  Being cruddy with me  You know what I mean  So if the girls  Are being disgusting  It's something sexy  About girls  Just doing dirty shit  What bugged me about that  Was the shit  And the puke  If it's a solid log  I could've enjoyed it  But the fact that  They were chewing it up  That to me  Is incomprehensibly gross  It just was  It was kind of sexy 
[03:23:00]  To me  They have fathers as well  That would've had to watch that  Although  It's saying that  I just hope my mum's  Not listening to this show  We're gonna go to  Teresa from New York  She's just amazed  By the last hour  Teresa what's up  What do you got  I think this is  Do you guys talk like this  Like when you go to bars  We talk worse  We're on the radio  We're playing it down  Because the public can hear  Yeah this is the beauty  Imagine when me  And Norton are alone  Oh my god  You guys are the most  Sexually honest people  I've ever heard  In my whole life  It is just amazing  What I'm listening to 
[03:23:30]  It is unbelievable  I love it  You ever been  Fished up  Teresa  What's the craziest thing  You have done  Oh Christ  I knew this was gonna  Turn to me somehow  Well it's alright  I'm really  I'm really really  Really very plain  I'm sorry  I have nothing for the show  Have you done anything  With fingers  Going anywhere crazy  Wait Tudart  Have you ever had a guy  Ask you to do something  That you thought  Might be a little gay  Gay on his part  Yeah like  You're like  I don't wanna do that  I don't wanna put a finger  In his ass or whatever  No actually  It's gone the other way 
[03:24:00]  Like I've tried it  And it's never worked out  Okay if I let  Come out of your ass  Would you consider me  To be a gay  You know what  In the moment  In the moment  I don't think you would  Yeah  I don't think the girl would  Cause it's just some  It's some like dirty  Yeah dirty stuff  Like treating a man  Like how you treat them  Cause they're the fuckies  So anytime  If you get a chance  To turn it around  You wanna use  Every chance you can  Wow  And hold it against him too  To make him less sexy  Exactly  And talk about it  To all their friends  Exactly  So you can get shoes  Exactly  So she can call you  A fucking  Come eating asshole 
[03:24:30]  Exactly  And call all his friends up  Tell all his friends  What he did  You like that  Don't you faggot  See the thing is  With me  You can tell them  My friends  My friends already know  It's like  Eight million people  Listening to this  Or something  They already know  What's the big deal  You can't disgrace me  Teresa thank you  One of my favorite clips  Was brought in by  Patrice Gavin  Do we have that  For Jim Jefferies  Oh is that great  Holy  Can you set this up  Patrice for everybody  Not really  You don't remember  I wasn't here when he did 
[03:25:00]  Okay Gavin is one of our friends  That Patrice introduced us to  He's real good friends  With Patrice  From England by the way  From England  He was in a hotel room  With a hooker I believe  The hooker strapped it on  And did Gavin's friend  In the ass  While Gavin  Filmed the whole thing  On a cell phone  And laughed  And laughed  All the way through it  And his friend is getting it  Gavin who  I'm not knowing  Gavin  No he's  He's as big as that doorway  Gavin the cloud  He's on a love boat  Just a big 
[03:25:30]  And I thought that was gay  At the time  And it was  And even Gavin  Just sitting there  With the fucking camera  Taping it  And laughing  And listening to this guy  Get mashed in his asshole  It's just  I'm like this  Because he's in such pain  Maybe you  You go  Like way too far  Thinking things are gay  Just because  They have anything to do  With something  As opposed to what  Because gay men kiss  I think fucking  Fetching guys  Can I say that  I'm not saying this like  Naughty naughty  You're gay  No I'm just saying  That's gay 
[03:26:00]  Can we be friends  And there might be  Some things I do  And I go  When Gavin set this thing up  I was thinking  Wow Gavin is gay  And I'm certainly  Not going to tell him  Because he's about  6'6  300 pounds  He's the least  Gay dude I know  Yeah  Not enough to fat on him  And then we played  This thing on the radio  I'm like  It's not gay  The guy just  The guy just made  Something  Not gay  I want to watch you  I want to watch you  Where is this  Listen  We don't have the video  He just gave us the audio  The audio is really good though  Listen to this  We got it Danny 
[03:26:30]  Yeah but you guys  Are talking over it  We are  Yeah I have it  It's just with you guys  Laughing and talking  And stuff over it though  Alright well  This is the only version we got  I thought we had a clean version  Yeah I mean I think Eric says  That we should have it  So if you want to  Just give it a minute  He might be able to  Yeah just come back to it  Oh Iraq  And I thought that was  But you know  He's laughing and this and that  I'm like  This is so gay  But I'm not saying it like  Hey stay away from me  You fags  It's just like  I go  Ass  Look at your own cup  It's like  That's gay  But it's not like  I give a fuck 
[03:27:00]  It's not  We're less friends  We got  Sucking your own dick stuff  Tom at Alabama  Yes  Tom let's go  Hey what's up  It's Brian  Oh  Hey uh yeah  A girlfriend  That I've been able  To suck my own dick  Found out when I was 12  So it was like heaven  But it is overrated  Because you can't  Enjoy it as much  While you're giving it  To yourself  And receiving  But I had a girlfriend  Whenever we were fucking 
[03:27:30]  I'd pull it out  Put it in my mouth  Lick her pussy juice  Off my dick  And put it back in  And she loved that  And told all her friends  About it  So after we broke up  One of her friends  Out of the club  Knew I could do that  Asked me that  She said  I heard you can  You can lick my clip  While you're fucking me  I was like yeah  So she went home  From the club with me  So that makes it  Negatively gay  That's pretty funny  Right  Like  You lick her clip  While you're fucking  While you're fucking  That's just like  A magic trick  You can't do that  You can suck your own cock  Or Jeremy can suck his own cock 
[03:28:00]  But you can't  Why sucking your own dick  Is gay  For the fact that  How do you approach  Sucking your own dick  You try  You try  Like how a fucking bitch  Would suck your dick  Do you suck your dick well  Or you suck it like a dude  Who's not gay  Do you understand what I'm saying  You suck dick well  When you suck your own dick  Are you doing a good job  Do you twirl the tongue  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  Do you really like  Or do you let spit come out 
[03:28:30]  You're fucking sissy  Are you giving yourself  A good one  If you suck your own dick  Or are you giving yourself  A bad blowjob  Are you giving  Exactly  Are you  You're fucking  Are you sucking it  Just to put your mouth on it  Why is jerking off okay  Or are you making it  It's just for  You know what  I just realized  Jerking off  Is gay  Is for pleasure  You want to come  Sucking your own dick  Is for pleasure  But the thing is  Jerking your dick  Is like  There's a  There's really a  It's no pleasure  You're trying to get  To an end  You're like  You suck your dick 
[03:29:00]  And then stop  And you're pretending  That it's a puss  On your  And you're looking  And you're just  Jerking your fucking dick  It's  But  Patrice makes a good point here  If you suck your own dick  You're thinking of a girl's mouth  Do you  Wait a minute  Do you suck it  Like you're jerking it off  Like  Hey I'm just gonna suck it  Just  Just to make sure  My pulse is up  You gotta keep your eyes closed  And maybe cry a little  And you make  And you make  Mmm sounds  Mmm  Like a bitch  You're sucking your dick 
[03:29:30]  Like a bitch  Or like a dude  Who's jerking off  When you jerk off  When you jerk off  Wait wait wait  When you jerk off  Do you do it  Like a girl would jerk you off  Are you trying to  Be sensuous  With your own cock  Or are you just  Pounding your meat  Until you come  How much do you hate  A bitch trying to  Jerk you off  It's senseless  When they try to  Jerk you off  And it's just like  It's like let me do it  The second I'm ready to come  You grab it  And fucking  Just do the last couple  Of strokes  I will give you the credit  What  You take the credit  How do you  You get the collar  It's kind of like 
[03:30:00]  Going fishing with your dad  He caught the fish  And then you reel it in  How do you create  That's how you deal  With girls jerking off  How do you create a style  To suck your own dick  We can't do it  That's why it sounds so crazy  None of us can do it  If we could do it  These guys  They can't answer that  The rarity  For us it's foreign  Because it's such a rarity  But if you could  Would you do it well  If I could  13 years old  12 years old  If you said to somebody  Will you jerk off  They'd probably go  No  I wouldn't  When you're a kid  You never want to admit  You jerk off  Or that you would  It's incomprehensible  Well as adults 
[03:30:30]  That's still the way  Dick sucking is to us  Because we never  Learned to do it  Patrice  Very famous story  On this show  My brother sucked  His own dick as a kid  And he's not gay  He's not a gay dude  And he explained it  This way  He goes  I wanted to get one  I didn't want to give one  Yeah that's a good point  You do it for pleasure  When you jerk off  Are you thinking  Wow I got a big dick  In my own  No you're going  Oh this feels good  Boy this one's a wobbly one  The feeling of the cock in your hand  The feeling of the cock in your hand  Is overridden 
[03:31:00]  By the feeling  Of being jerked  So I'm imagining  Being sucked  Let me tell you something  When I jerk my dick  I don't even pay attention  To my dick  Right  My hand and my dick  Are inconsequential  To the fact that I'm looking  At something  Or thinking about something  And jerking off  But the act of sucking  Your own dick  Is no fault  You are sucking  Your own dick  But we can't do it  You don't have to be  Pay attention to that shit  Sometimes I put love beads  Up my ass  While I wank  Is that gay  And then yank him off  Just as I'm coming  No  You're already out of the picture 
[03:31:30]  Man  David in Tennessee  What's up  Hey fellas  What's going on  The great Ron Jeremy says  Sucking your own dick  Feels incredibly good  Right up to the point  You realize you have  A dick in your mouth  Well Ron does a lot  Of funny things  Yeah  Hey if I can make  An observation here  What's that  I have no idea  Listening on hold  Who wants to listen  Sound like Sal  It's so much different  Than on the radio  Fly on the wall  Is amazing  Just to hear it on hold  Why  What's the difference  What's the difference  I don't know

He smells, but that's the way the fucking room  probably smelled. This is like a new thing in the future.  Smell a radio. 
[03:36:30]  Like scratch it stiff.  Fucking Gavin  laughing to the whole thing. Just kills him.  That's what  I'm talking about. Is that McCain's wife  in the red? Yeah. Huh?  Fucking hot broad. Yeah, McCain's  wife's all right. She's like Amy Poehler.  Fuck, damn, jeez.  Look at this little Halle Berry fucking...  Fucking hell.  What is she...  That's great.  Listen to this orgasm.  How would you like to come like that? 
[03:37:00]  Can you play...  Could you play the famous one where  it was, uh, guess the sound?  I don't want to give it away.  Where, uh... Oh, right, right, right.  With the yee-haw guy.  Yeah, I have it.  Yeah, I think so.  Here's, uh, Tom Sizemore  from his, uh, porno movie  that he did.  Oh! 
[03:37:30]  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Yeah!  And here's, uh,  a little Asian, uh,  woman, um,  getting shit on.  That's gonna be their national anthem.  I fucking love it.  The unhappier the girl is,  the fucking happier the girl is.  Oh, yeah.  The fucking knees are mental  when it comes to that.  Oh, yeah.  They're sick.  I'm telling you, I watch it.  They pixelate the cock,  but they don't pixelate the shit.  No, the pubic hair. 
[03:38:00]  Only the pubic hair.  Yeah, and the dog's cock  is fine to have in there.  You know, it's horrible stuff.  It's all, it's all rape,  and it's all tying up  in a row.  Pedophilia, yeah.  It's all, it's all,  it's all dressed like  school kids and stuff.  It's a fucking horrible.  It's a World War losing thing,  I'm telling you,  because Germany is the same way.  It's, it's got something to do  when your country  concedes a World War.  The whole fucking psyche  of the nation goes down.  Yeah, well, yeah,  that makes perfect sense.  No, the porn in Japan  is fucking,  even I go,  it's fucking sick, man. 
[03:38:30]  There's just shit  coming out on her.  You hear it crackling.  Yeah, you hear the crackling  of the pudding.  Do you guys want to,  of the sausage?  That fucking  chocolate mousse crackle.  You want to end this weird show  with a version of  What's Up Eastside Dave's butt?  What, does he want to play?  Would you?  I would love to.  Is it a competition?  He wants to play?  Yeah, I'll play.  Yeah, it's a question-answer  segment with Dave,  Eastside Dave  from the Ron and Fez show,  12 to 3, 
[03:39:00]  here on Channel 202.  And Eastside Dave  puts something in his ass,  we ask him questions  and try to guess  what is indeed  in his ass.  Right?  Yeah.  That's the old joke, man.  He said he won't come in  unless he has his music.  Oh, all right.  Oh, wow.  Here's his music.  Does he actually put  something in his ass?  Oh, he certainly does.  We got an intro  on everything,  Jim Jeffries.  Oh, excellent.  And now, ladies and gentlemen,  it's time once again  for What's Up,  Eastside Dave's Box!  Eastside Dave has 
[03:39:30]  stuck an object  of his ass,  and Opie and Anthony  have to figure out  what it is.  It's What's Up,  Eastside Dave's Box!  Hey, everyone.  Hey, Dave.  It's great to be here.  It's great to play  another round of this game.  I'd like to notify that  Anthony and Jimmy  are tied for first.  One point each.  What?  Hair looks good.  In the game.  I'm keeping score.  Your hair looks awesome.  Thank you very much. 
[03:40:00]  Well, I'm still  in the Afro competition,  as you know,  and I don't admit defeat.  Jim Jeffries,  we're having an Afro competition,  and we actually pinned him down  and shaved the top of his head,  and he refused to admit defeat,  and he's still in Afro.  He's still an Afro,  in my opinion.  He doesn't have a problem  with his hair.  That's just after we  shaved the top of his head.  You know I'm holding him down  and shaving his head  is really good.  Dave is fucking insane.  Just cut the rest of your hair off.  This is an Afro. 
[03:40:30]  I don't understand  why you guys  don't think this is an Afro.  Okay, you're married, yeah?  You're married.  I have a run, yes.  Fuck it, man.  Don't get out of the competition.  You don't need to pick up chicks.  Don't let them fucking beat you.  You're absolutely right.  You're goddamn right.  Yeah, you just put things  up your ass  and have your head shaved.  There's some spots on here,  but the Valtrex  is going to clear that up.  He's got spots on his neck.  That haircut is so funny.  He's got a big...  It looks like a fucking...  It looks like a thumb  with a cape.  Oh, my God.  Did you shave his dick as well?  No, I did that, Jim.  All right, good for you. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  The way you're doing  is so tugging on it.  I got bored and...  All right, if I touch it  with my little finger,  does that make me gay?  No, if you're joking around,  it's not.  Come on.  Take a pull on it.  No, no, I won't pull it.  I'll touch it,  but I won't pull it.  Oh, Jesus.  He's like,  Dave, come close.  He's a big international comedian  and you don't have to touch your dick.  Oh, this is so gay.  Touch it.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Do you want to do this again?  Anything else?  I don't want to touch it again. 
[03:41:30]  I guarantee...  I dare you to fucking touch it  with your thumb and pointer face.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Or just tickle his ball bag.  No, no, no, that was horrible.  It's not gay.  It's guys palling around.  I'm not touching his...  I'm not touching his...  Palling around.  Everyone's so homophobic.  No.  Fuck me a little bit.  Get it away from me.  Would you tickle his bag  and go, teehee?  That little red-haired ginger thing.  There's a spot on your sack.  There's a spot just there.  Just pretend I'm the Coppertone girl.  What's the spot?  Look at his hair. 
[03:42:00]  His hair rules.  His dicks out and his hair.  He's just a fucking mess, Dave.  He's just a fucking mess, Dave.  And he's walking around  with something in his ass  this whole time.  He's completely naked.  By the way,  like a consummate professional,  I've had something in my ass  for 45 minutes.  All right, all right.  I've been waiting since 10.  Shit!  I've got to go wash me fingers.  Steve Seekin says,  get here at 10 o'clock.  What's the spot from, really?  Jim, like I said,  I'm very sensitive  and I say maintain 
[03:42:30]  that they're fever blisters  because I get hives.  We see him?  No, there's no spots.  Oh, there is spots on your dick!  Give me this soap!  I don't know what that is.  But I have lots of discolorations.  Bring your cock closer.  We've got to set it up.  There's no reason for it.  What does Dr. Steve think that is?  Actually, that's pretty good lube  for a little...  Stop jerking.  Okay, sorry.  Now his cock smells like alloy.  All right, are we going to play 
[03:43:00]  What's Up, Eastside Dave's Butt?  Now, we go around the room, Jim Jeffries.  We'll start with you.  You can ask questions  about what's up his butt.  Okay, is it bigger than an Easter egg?  Yeah.  I didn't say how big the Easter egg.  I was talking about  those big fuckers that you got.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Just right, it's bigger than that.  It's bigger than that.  Yeah, yeah, it's a little bigger than that.  It's bigger than an egg.  It's bigger than an egg.  You got something up your ass  that's bigger than an egg?  I think it's, you know,  not by a huge margin,  but yeah, it's bigger than an egg.  It's egg-ish.  Is it edible? 
[03:43:30]  No.  So it's not an egg.  Okay.  Oh, we're going that way?  I'll check it.  Patrice doesn't even want to fucking know.  Why?  Is it a kid's toy?  No.  Fuck.  Is it plastic?  No.  God damn it.  Do you use it every day?  I do.  I can use it my little fun.  Okay.  Wait, I do.  I do.  Might have gave you something away there.  Yeah, yeah, maybe.  Is it a razor to shave with? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, what happened there?  No, I'm sorry.  I think I have a little bit  of shitties coming on.  I'm not fucking around.  So let's get this round over real quick.  A little bit of shitties coming on.  Seriously, so we've got to get this round over.  I've got a little bit of shitties coming on.  By the way, Rockfest noon to three.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, ten minutes too late.  No, no, no.  No one beat me.  Already punched out.  You missed an opportunity.  I can't say it towards enough.  Yeah, pass that around.  I'm not even close to this. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not touching anything.  I'm not touching the sanitizer.  I'm fucking clean.  I'm not touching the God fucking thing over here.  Thank you.  Is it, uh, whose guess is it?  Uh, Jim's.  No, Jim guessed.  I said it's something you use every day.  Is it herpes cream?  No.  Okay.  And, um, I thought it might be a razor.  A metal razor.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Shit.  Is it every day?  Come on.  It's not gay to guess.  Is it fabric?  No.  It's not fabric.  No. 
[03:45:00]  Why are you taking this so seriously?  I think it's getting very, very serious.  Yeah, well, this is my one time to shine on the Oakland Anthony show.  Are you angry now, Patrice?  Because I touched the car.  Okay.  Do that.  Jealous.  Use it every day.  What the fuck?  I don't give a shit.  I use it every day.  Some people don't use it at all.  All right.  It's, uh, deodorant.  No.  Fuck.  No.  Mr. Anthony, again, I apologize for any text messages I might have left you.  Thank you.  I've been drunk a lot.  Is it, uh, is it more than one piece put together, or is it a single thing, or is it 
[03:45:30]  multiple pieces put together?  Does it have multiple pieces?  It's something that has, yes, things inside it.  It's multiple things.  Multiple things.  Okay.  Is it a stillborn child?  Pocket knife.  No.  Oh, that was a good guest, though.  No, it's Swiss Army, because I figured he's an alcoholic.  There's things that's...  Bottle opener.  I'm thinking some...  So, alcoholics, you Swiss Army?  No, bottle opener.  It has, like, all the stuff on it.  No, but there's stuff inside the...  Okay. 
[03:46:00]  Is it my turn?  Yeah, I went for stillborn.  I think it's some kind of, uh, bottle of something, like maybe pills or something like that.  You said not plastic.  No, it's not a bottle.  God damn.  Oh, my God.  Is it a kinder surprise?  Do you have them in these games?  I use it every day.  Some people don't use it at all.  Like, you know, some people...  I mean, some people don't do it at all.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  I do do it.  Okay, here we go.  I got it.  What do you think?  No, it's not plastic.  Is it a bottle opener?  It's not plastic.  Go ahead, Dan.  No, it's not plastic. 
[03:46:30]  It's a metal.  That's a tough one.  No, it's not metal.  Okay, okay.  Let's find out what material is.  Okay.  This is odd.  Is it a food type thing?  Is it food?  It's not food.  It's not edible.  It's not edible.  It's not edible, but...  So it's unedible.  Ah.  No, but you know what I'm saying with that hint?  Like, it's not edible.  No, I don't know what you're saying.  Drinkable?  It's drinkable.  No, but you're...  Oh, is it a...  No.  It's not food. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Is it dissolvable?  I'm going to think toothpaste.  No, but...  Moss?  No, it's not dental hygiene.  I'll say that.  Mouthwash.  Is it a small thing of shampoo?  It's a tube or something.  No.  Mouthwash.  No.  No, it's not plastic.  Is it in liquid form inside the container?  No.  Jesus.  You guys got a fucking keychain last week.  I know.  This is, I think, a lot simpler.  Really?  Is it a key?  We're thinking too much, I think.  I got it.  You're thinking too much, it's not plastic.  Is it a comb?  No. 
[03:47:30]  Somebody, uh...  I can't take this.  Uh...  Salt shaker.  No.  It's not a salt shaker.  No.  Is it made of glass?  No, but...  I think if you start thinking along those lines of what it's made out of,  you might stumble on the right answer.  It's not edible.  Right.  But...  Okay.  But something edible could be in it.  No, no, no.  See, if it's not edible...  It's a hot dog then.  Something edible is, in my opinion, something that needs to be eaten. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  Very good.  So this thing isn't eaten, but it's...  It's another man's cock.  It can go...  Maybe, uh, down the throat?  It can go...  It's a bottle of aspirin?  It can go near the mouth.  It's cum.  Exactly.  Oh, oh, oh.  Um...  Is it a lipstick?  No.  Chapstick?  No.  No, no, no.  But...  No, it's not toothpaste.  We've already tried toothpaste.  Nose spray.  A dental pill.  Is it toothbrush?  Ear drops. 
[03:48:30]  Is it a toothbrush?  Is it eye drops?  No.  A cigarette.  It's a package of cigarettes!  Oh, God.  Oh!  Oh, God, no.  It takes the real deal.  Now, wait.  Oh!  It takes the real deal.  Oh, God.  Wait, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  God knows!  God knows I love smoking!  Where's my fucking luck? 
[03:49:00]  Get E-Rock in here.  Get E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, come here.  E-Rock.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on, Dave.  Hold on.  He needs a garbage pill?  Eric, you gotta come.  I think he's faking it.  You gotta...  Hold that.  Hold that.  No, no.  Don't throw that out yet.  You gotta smell that cigarette pack.  I think he's faking it.  Yeah, I think he's faking it, too.  Smell that cigarette pack.  Oh, it's all brown.  Just smell it.  Don't touch it.  It's all brown.  I got some shitties.  Eric, just...  Eric, smell it.  He's faking it.  Smell it.  You don't have to touch it. 
[03:49:30]  Just get near it.  He's got his shit in the bin!  He's got his shit in the bin!  Who cares?  Go ahead.  I dare you.  I double dare you.  No.  Oh, no!  Fuck!  Oh, fuck!  I told you I was gonna get shitties!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, I told you I was gonna get shitties!  I'm just kidding!  You guys thought I was fucking around!  Ralph Fence doing the three! 
[03:50:00]  We got our very own Gigi Allen in the studio!  Fuck!  I knew I was gonna get the shitties!  It's DG tells me to get here at 9.45.  I'm here, I'm waiting.  Oh!  The one we...  Oh!  Oh, no!  Dave just whinked his ass, which freaked out Jim Jeffries, and then decided to stuff 
[03:50:30]  the toilet paper in his mouth.  Patrice?  You're fucking the new Gigi Allen, bro.  That's good.  Patrice is disgusting.  He has been silenced.  This is what it takes to silence you!  Oh, my God.  I would have brought him in a year ago!  I told you I had the shitties!  It's just...  Ron says, dude, it's three!  Oh, he still owes me $400!  It's E. Coli going on in here.  Oh, God, it stinks!  Oh, it smells! 
[03:51:00]  I'm breathing through my mouth, and if I smell this new shit, it's just...  Dave, oh, my God.  That was horrible.  Dave, why are you leaving?  We didn't play your outro music yet.  Okay.  Hold on, man.  Would you let him wear your hat?  He put shit in his mouth!  Oh, dude.  He's the real fucking deal.  Dave...  All right, spray that gliding stuff.  Spray that smell around.  And that's how you play What's Up Eastside Dave's Ass, Jim Jefferies.  Yeah.  Some contestants will take on the home version of What's Up Eastside Dave's Butt. 
[03:51:30]  Promotional consideration given to anybody who gives a fuck.  What's Up Eastside Dave's Butt is copyright 2008 Oby-Handy Productions.  We'll see you next time when we play...  What's Up Eastside Dave's Butt?  Goodbye, everyone.  Bye, Dave.  Bye.  There he goes, Dave, everybody.  Good luck with your ass, Dave.  All right, bye, Dave.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That is just...  And now he's running to the bathroom.  I can't believe I touched his cock.  That was a bit gay.  Shocking.  A bit.  Shit into the garbage can. 
[03:52:00]  What a silly goose.  When he shit into that fucking garbage can...  Goddamn, is that...  Does he do that often?  Is that the first time you've seen him shit in the garbage can?  I've never seen him shit in a garbage can like that.  Iraq, take this out of here.  He saves only the best stuff for our show.  Get Iraq.  Is he famous for this or something?  Or what is he...  He's actually an author.  He's actually an author.  Is he really?  No.  Kid books or...  No.  All right.  He's Eastside Dave, everyone.  Get Eric in here to take this out.  Dave!  Is that what he does for a living? 
[03:52:30]  Good for him.  Yeah.  Master Paul won't let me wipe my ass.  What?  Master Paul won't let me wipe my ass.  Are they fucking rubbing together all salty and sore right now?  Yeah.  I got...  And some of the poo went on my cock.  And I can't afford more...  I can't afford more irritations in that area.  Where's...  Get Iraq to take this out.  He said he's not coming in.  Tell him to come in.  He's got a job to do.  Iraq, get in here.  I'm sitting right here, Eric.  I'm sitting next to it.  Take it out.  It's a garbage can with shit in it.  What are you fucking... 
[03:53:00]  Can we get a mic on Iraq?  Iraq.  What's in the...  You don't have to eat it.  Yeah, what's in the bin?  Oh, it's yellow.  Yellow and brown and...  Yellow?  What's wrong with you?  Oh.  He touched the bite.  Oh, that's a bite.  Now carry Dave's shit out.  Carry Dave's shit.  Dave doesn't carry his own shit out.  He's a star.  I'm a 202 co-champion. 
[03:53:30]  What was that about?  I'm a champion.  202.  Biggest gainer, baby.  This has been the most...  And co-champion of the Afro Wars.  No, Afro Wars is over.  You lost that a while ago.  Can I pay the rest of my money?  Let me see what I got for you today.  I do have to pay him.  Oh, yes.  Pay him, baby.  How much do you pay him for shitting a bin?  No, this is...  I'm trying...  I'm trying to pay him so he can join our program.  I'll give you 50 today.  Money talks, baby. 
[03:54:00]  I'll give you 50 today.  Hold on a minute.  Wow.  I will give you 50, but you have to come over and get it.  Is your ass filthy right now?  Yes.  He won't let me leave.  What?  Master Paul won't let me leave the building.  Wipe your ass?  Why?  It's like a catch 24 because he won't let me leave the building, but then at the same  time, how am I supposed to wipe it off?  Right.  50.  50 dollars.  Okay.  As a bribe?  Thank you very much.  There's no shit on your hand, is there? 
[03:54:30]  No, not on this one.  Just throw the money.  I wouldn't touch.  That's $10.  Oh.  I'm trying to make it dramatic.  Okay.  We're still doing it.  Dramatic.  Here's another 20.  That's 30.  How is that?  This is horrible.  This is horrible.  What's wrong?  I just touched a guy who's shat in a fucking bin.  I feel dirty.  I need a big fucking bath.  Like it's clean in England, for Christ's sakes.  No, no.  I'm all right.  Give me 20.  No!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[03:55:00]  That's right!  That's right!  That's right!  You fucking nailed him in the head.  Get him!  Get him!  Get him!  No one's going to grab him.  No, no, no.  You're going to hold him down.  He's coming in shit.  Oh, you let him go!  They're grabbing him.  He's naked!  No, he's going to...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  He's got shit on his fingers!  Bring it!  He's like a superhero.  Bring it!  He's got shit on his fingers!  Bring it!  Bring it!  Ah!  He's got shit on his fingers! 
[03:55:30]  Let me explain what just happened.  He's got shit on his fingers!  He just wiped his hand in his asshole.  Hold on, let me explain what happened.  This is like his hostage situation.  Hold on.  Have a clear nail.  Hold on, hold on!  Just stay there.  We've got to stand still.  Okay, okay.  We'll have to stand still.  Hold on.  Don't bother.  I've got to explain.  I was giving the money to him slowly because we were going to pin him down and shave his head today.  He was able to get naked, which is freaking everyone out.  Then he put shit on his hand.  We got Master Poe and a lot of guys that want to attack him, and he's holding everybody off with his shitty hand.  Dave, Dave, a hundred bucks right now if you fucking 20, 40, 60, 80. 
[03:56:00]  A hundred bucks right now if you stick your fingers in your mouth and clean your fingers at your mouth.  Oh, no.  A hundred bucks if you clean your fingers.  I'll chip in another 20.  I'll chip in another 20 if you do it.  Give me a lunch pill.  A hundred bucks.  20, 40, 60, 80.  All right, I'll give him a hundred.  All right, here.  I'll pay you, too.  I'll pay you.  This is the best fucking day of my life.  Here's another hundred.  I'll pay you.  All right, hold on.  Clean those fingers.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's another. 
[03:56:30]  I'm good for it.  I want those fingers clean.  All right, Jim, get out of the way a minute.  There you go.  Okay.  Okay, here he goes.  All those fingers clean, Dave.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Suck them clean, kiddo.  Jesus, please forgive me.  They're not clean, Dave.  Suck the shit off them. 
[03:57:00]  I can still see the brown on the back of them.  What are you doing?  Clean those fucking...  You're not going to eat...  Wash it.  Suck the fingers clean.  You got to clean them.  You got to clean them.  Clean them.  I'll pay you, Dave.  Clean those fingers.  He's puking like an animal.  He's an animal.  Come on, they're clean now. 
[03:57:30]  Holy shit.  I can't fucking take this.  Good job.  God bless you, sir.  Here's the other 20.  I...  I...  Holy Jesus Christ.  I'm going to give you a 20 of yourself.  That's the best thing I've ever said.  Not with that hand.  Reach for the other hand.  Patrice, comment.  Patrice is just sitting on his phone.  He can't even deal. 
[03:58:00]  Is that tax deductible to say that I donated money to a man who cleans shit off his fingers?  Yeah.  Like, it is a business expense.  Oh, my God.  Get the pail out of here.  Oh, Iraq.  Get the pail.  Eric.  Eric.  Get Eric in here.  Hey, pail grabber.  Oh, my God.  I just got it.  Where's the fucking pail grabber?  Iraq.  Oh, God.  No, no, no spray.  No spray.  This is horrible.  Get the pail grabber in here.  Oh, God.  Get Iraq.  He's got to grab that pail.  That's his job.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Iraq, you are the pail grabber. 
[03:58:30]  Iraq, get that pail.  It doesn't even smell.  It's a fucking goof.  Yeah, come on, Iraq.  Smell it.  You all right, Iraq?  No.  How does it smell?  Now, put it in that fucking room, in the fucking producer room here.  What's wrong with you people?  Jesus.  I've got to say, this is the most adult show I've ever been on.  This is just how radio in England works.  It's exactly the same.  Hey, Paul.  He actually didn't fake that.  If you're at home right now and you're thinking he faked that, he cleaned shit off his fingers 
[03:59:00]  with his mouth then followed.  Yes, he did.  And Poe finally met his match.  Yeah.  He's taken on all challengers over the last three and a half years, but you wouldn't go  near him when he...  No.  When he had this...  No, no way.  When he was naked in the middle of the room with his shithand as people are trying to  get at him.  He fucking pulled that out like some kind of superhero shit guy.  He came in.  Everyone went to attack him.  He stuck his hand up his ass, pulled out all brown, all over everything, and then did 
[03:59:30]  the Heisman Trophy pose.  Yeah, like...  And it was like, you can't come near me.  You can't come near me.  Poe, you haven't trained for something like that?  What good are you?  No.  Samurai shithand?  No, I haven't.  What good are you, man?  He used this...  Yeah, the samurai shithand.  All of a sudden, me looking...  That's like kryptonite for Paul.  Isn't that bad, is it?  Not bad, Jim Jefferies.  Not bad.  You're coming second to that.  I'm a pretty clean guy in comparison.  Patrice is disgusting.  He's shell-shocked.  Patrice hasn't said anything for 20 minutes.  Patrice is shell-shocked.  Yeah.  That face. 
[04:00:00]  Wonderful.  What's wrong, Patrice?  What are you going to say after that, right?  Yeah.  What the fuck can you say?  I need to...  To the shitty guy.  What could you fucking say?  He's diseased fucking E. coli's running around with a shit on his fingertips.  He just made a fucking fortune, though, man.  240?  No, he didn't.  That's a lot of money for Dave.  If you listen to Ryan, thousands of fortune.  240 plus he's 50 that you gave.  Yeah.  290 bucks.  And you gave him 10, right?  I gave him 20, yeah.  I gave him 100. 
[04:00:30]  Wait, 100?  Jimmy, you gave him 100?  Yes.  I gave him 50 for something else that I gave him off.  250.  270?  That's good for him, man.  If you listen to Ryan Efez, he needs every dollar he can find.  Jesus.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasySports.net.  If you're a fantasy baseball player, so much for getting out of here early today, huh?  I do, right?  We have meetings that are waiting for us right now.  Make sure to log on to Bodog to get the edge this year.  It's free, and they offer public and private leagues in a variety of ways to play. 
[04:01:00]  He held everyone back with one shit hit.  Well, of course.  I'll tell you what.  That was very creative.  Yes.  The defense method, like a skunk or fucking...  The worst thing was when he wiped his ass and put the toilet paper in his mouth and  just screamed with glee.  Now, the fingers were worse.  When he wiped his ass, I saw a big brown streak on that toilet paper, and he threw it  right in his mouth.  But it was like sick brown shit.  It's almost like when you've been on the ball.  It was like butterscotch.  Sick.  Sick.  It wasn't a healthy log.  It was fucking light brown.  It curled out.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[04:01:30]  He's the new GGL.  He's got to be sad again.  He really did.  He ate shit.  He ate shit for us.  It's the fastest growing fantasy experience in the country.  BodogFantasySports.net.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Right now, they're actually perfect.  You're right.  Patrice is right.  You know what I heard?  No, they're not perfect.  People do boring radio way better than this.  You're listening to one of those shows.  Right to another runner-up line of the day.  And I'm a woman who can't have kids. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  I'm a woman with no ovaries and balls.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just got to communicate.  E-Rock neglected to pick up the pack of cigarettes.  Is it still on the floor?  Eric.  Eric.  Get some tongues.  Jim Jeffries is going to be at Caroline's here in New York City Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  I highly recommend you go see Jim Jeffries.  Jim, go on Friday night.  I'm going to check you out Friday night.  Okay, cool.  What a proud moment.  And the gang's going to talk to you about the O&A Traveling Virus comedy tour. 
[04:02:30]  Excellent.  I think we're going to do a few dates this summer.  Where's E-Rock?  Hey.  He's shirking his duties.  His duties.  Where is he?  Eric, stop shirking your responsibilities.  I'm basically stealing from XM.  All right, here's another.  Oh, there's E-Rock.  You're picking it up?  Oh, tentatively.  Smell it.  Just smell it.  No, I'm not smelling it.  E-Rock, talk to us.  Thanks for nothing.  Thanks for...  Hey, talk to us, Eric.  What are you doing?  We're on the air. 
[04:03:00]  Talk to us.  That's what you just said.  Um...  E-Rock.  Someone get rid of these toilet paper.  It's got like a brown stain on the side of the whole roll.  No way.  It does?  Look at this.  Oh, come on.  Oh, dude.  He's got...  He had sick shit.  This show...  He did.  He had sick boy shit.  He upset tummy shit.  This show got a little weird today.  Just a little bit.  Yeah, a little.  It started off and just got weirder and weirder.  We should have these every day. 
[04:03:30]  That's fucking what we need every day on the show.  Every day.  How are we going to do that every day?  Until he does.  I mean, not shit eating, but you know.  But something of that ilk.  Yeah.  Here's another runner-up.  Line of the day.  What else can we do with them?  No one's buying.  I don't know.  Put them on the end of fingerless gloves, baby.  Sell them as Calabari rings.  Oh, God.  That was a great line.  Patrice, who has been silent for the last hour.  I mean, I don't have any commentary about shitty hand things.  No, your plug.  The plug. 
[04:04:00]  I forgot.  Laughing Post.  Where am I?  Laughing Post.  Laughing Post in Kalamazoo, Michigan this weekend, man.  And Patrice O'Neil dot com?  Yeah, I think so.  I don't remember.  You're shell-shocked right now.  Yeah, I was just like, I've just never seen just that.  I can't imagine a bunch of black guys sitting around watching that.  It doesn't happen.  It just doesn't happen.  Right, watching that and giggling like idiots.  You sick bastards fucking your fat cheeks.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had some fucking fat girls, but boy, definitely not wiping shit with our hands.  Yeah.  Well, in a pinch, you know.  So, quick plug. 
[04:04:30]  Next Saturday, April 12th, Pontiac, Michigan.  Clutch Cargoes.  And for me, Thursday through Sunday, April 17th through 20th, Caroline's here in New York.  Oh, that's going to sell out.  I hope so.  I hope so.  And in May, I'm in Pittsburgh.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes.  God damn it.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  They probably didn't use it, because the Secret Service agent has his hand on the guys. 
[04:05:00]  They obviously know he wasn't a threat.  The last thing they want to do is get Barack Obama killed while they're watching him.  The signal is he tips.  Yeah.  Butt-G, Butt-G, Butt-G, Buzz.  That's going to stay with me a while, that image.  Yeah, it's been a shitty day.  Thank you very much.  Patreek.  Patreek-y.  Patreek-y.  Good seeing you. 
[04:05:30]  Thanks for coming in.  Thank you for having me.  Jim, Jeffrey's.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, Jim's coming back tomorrow.  And, uh...  Then we won't see you for about, what, six months or something?  Sam, thank you.  We have meetings.  So let's go to our meetings.  Yeah, we got to go to our meetings.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Oh, day was good.  Are you a woman looking to get off?  Then call the Jim Norton Phone Sex Hotline.  I'll talk dirty to you.  I don't think you could, either.  No, you're wrong, sweetie. 
[04:06:00]  I'll talk dirty to you well.  Jim will personally guide you through your wildest fantasies.  Just take a listen.  All right, I want you to picture yourself, uh, you're lying back.  And I'm there with you.  And, um...  And then I take my underpants off.  Mmm.  I want to hold your legs open and tease your thighs.  Getting wet.  And I start to lick all the way away from your crotch to tease you.  And I start licking down towards your knee.  Prepare to be ravaged.  I'm going to rub my butt right on your vagina. 
[04:06:30]  And I'm going to start to turtle into it.  I'm going to hang a half a log out.  And I'm going to, like, hold it with my butt cheeks.  And then I'm going to fuck you with my poop for a few seconds.  And I'm going to grunt as I put it in like this.  Want more?  Call 1-800-VAG-POOP. </pre>
