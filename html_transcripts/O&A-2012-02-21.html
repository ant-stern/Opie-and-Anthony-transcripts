<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts and producer Sam Roberts discussing Sam's recent jury duty experience.  Sam recounted how he successfully avoided jury duty by revealing his employment with the show, a tactic that amused the potential jury pool and led to his dismissal.  The conversation then branched into various humorous anecdotes and strategies for escaping jury duty, including a caller, Kenny, sharing a story about a police officer who, despite attempts to avoid service, was selected and significantly influenced a civil case's outcome, denying the plaintiff compensation.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the ESPN "chink in the armor" controversy surrounding a headline about Jeremy Lin.  The hosts debated the headline's intent, the firing of the editor, and the suspension of the anchor, referencing public reaction, particularly from politician Judy Chu. The conversation, filled with offensive language, explored the complexities of language, political correctness, and the potential for misinterpretations, touching upon the implications of removing certain words from common usage and featuring numerous audience calls.  This discussion also broadened to encompass other instances of politically incorrect language, including the firing of a D.C. councilman for using "niggardly," and the broader issue of cancel culture. A caller referenced a Saturday Night Live skit satirizing racial slurs, and the hosts mentioned their intention to watch it.  The segment also included brief discussions of Whitney Houston's four-hour funeral and a Twitter feud between CM Punk and Chris Brown.  A recording of a British jazz radio station accidentally broadcasting four minutes of gay porn was played.  Comedian Joe DeRosa was a guest in the studio.


The broadcast continued with further discussion surrounding the accidental airing of gay porn on a British jazz radio station, speculation about the employee's likely firing, and humorous observations about the incident. The show then transitioned to professional wrestling, specifically the Undertaker's return and a comparison of wrestling event titles to gay porn film titles.  A side conversation about one co-host's home renovations and his cat's repeated falls down the stairs followed.  A confused live read for the dating website Estmen.com ensued, resulting in numerous jokes about its business model. The show returned to Whitney Houston's death and funeral, discussing the excessive media coverage, comparing it to past events like the Kennedy assassination and the O.J. Simpson trial, and speculating about the origins of this excessive coverage.  Bobby Brown's behavior at the funeral and Clive Davis's post-death party were also mentioned.  Joe DeRosa's upcoming stand-up performances were briefly mentioned again.

The final segment heavily featured Joe DeRosa's credit card woes, with DeRosa detailing his frustrations with late payment penalties, drastically reduced credit limits, and harassing calls from credit agencies.  Strategies for handling credit card issues were discussed. Opie announced upcoming live shows, including a one-hour special taping in Cleveland (chosen due to technical issues in Boston).  A humorous exchange about a fan sending in a picture with checks for autographs, focusing on the fan's handwriting and the value of the hosts' signatures, took place.  The segment concluded with further discussion of DeRosa's financial problems and the importance of health insurance for comedians, along with lighthearted riffing on a listener's misheard weather report.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning!  Ooh!  It's Grim in the Morning.  I was wondering what the name was this morning.  You forgot already?  Yeah, I know there's Morning Jam, but I'm like, what is it with...  Oh, I thought it was the O that we used. That's right, it's the G.  It's Grim in the Morning.  What is it, Monday, Tuesday? Where are we at?  Monday? Tuesday?  Yes.  It's Tuesday. 
[00:00:30]  I thought Sam was fired, man.  I was so happy.  So I hope, yeah.  And now he's here?  I don't know if you realize this, but you actually have the power to make that happen if you actually want it to.  Well, that's why I'm surprised.  I guess they didn't get the message.  Where were you Friday? I thought you were fired, for real.  No, I was in jury duty.  Jury duty?  I told you that.  Yes, I was in jury duty.  Oh, I forgot you told me, I guess.  I emailed it out.  So why did you get out of jury duty?  Because they asked, what's your profession? 
[00:01:00]  And I wrote down, talk show producer.  Right.  And they said, Sam, you're Sam Roberts.  What talk show do you work for?  Right.  When they were going around the room.  Right.  And I said, the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  And one of the lawyers chuckled, he obviously listens, and half the room chuckled as well.  And then after that, I didn't get asked any more questions and didn't get selected to be on any jury.  After that, they cleaned up your paperwork and said, beat it.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead and have a watch.  I would suggest that to every listener out there.  Just tell them that you work for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  You'll get out of jury duty.  Oh, yes, yes.  How long were you there for?  I showed up at like 9, and I was out by 12.30.  Oh, that's nice.  It was nothing.  I actually got in a classroom once out there in Long Island.  They put you in what looks like classrooms, and I'm in the middle of a drunk driving case.  And how I got out of jury duty is I was getting so frustrated because everyone said, look, you just got to go for the day, and they'll excuse you.  Now it's like 4 or 5 in the afternoon, and I'm in the middle of a drunk driving case as they're deciding who in the room might be good. 
[00:02:00]  And all of a sudden, I, in a panic, just went, ah, I don't have time for this.  And they looked at me from the front of the room like, who is that guy?  Because I just lost it.  I'm like, no, I don't want to be part of this.  Yeah, there was, they only needed three jurors.  They had most of the jury full, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, you were close.  Yeah, they were going through the, it was pretty much what you had to do, but it wasn't until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  We were in like a classroom, and there was like.  Oh, you, all right, so you got to that classroom stage. 
[00:02:30]  26, 27 of us.  Yeah.  And they did the first group of 12, and they, then they were selecting alternates.  Right.  Because they need two alternates, and that's when I was up for selection.  But once I said I worked for the Opie Anthony show, it was not.  Yeah, in past years, I never made it to the room.  And now I'm in the room, and I'm thinking, oh my God, I might be stuck.  So I acted out.  And it worked.  It worked, though, right?  Oh, yeah, and then there was like some kind of like, they took a five-minute break.  Next thing you know, they're like, you're free to go. 
[00:03:00]  Me and a few others.  I'm like, nice.  Because people are afraid to say that they don't want to be there.  Like, if you actually say, I don't want to be on jury duty.  That doesn't work anymore, because they know that's what everyone else does.  Yeah, but the lawyers won't pick you, because the lawyers are afraid, like the defense attorney  is afraid that you'll just say guilty, so you can get the trial done quicker.  Right, right.  Well, then that would be a good thing to say that.  Yeah, it would be.  It was in my case.  They know that, but they're going to make you suffer for a bunch of hours before they  go.  Obviously, we're not using him, but we're not telling him we're not using him for at least 
[00:03:30]  three or four hours, because he used that tack.  Oh, they'll make you sit there to be dicks.  Oh, yeah, of course.  So you've got to be really careful.  Of course that's going to work, but it depends how many hours you're going to have to wait  for it to finally work.  I told them I could be open and analytical about everything, but...  No, the best is to just act out like you're just a fucking irritable asshole, like I did  that day.  Yeah, because I'm picturing like, man, I'm nice.  I don't have to work right now.  You know, I've been doing a lot of beach days, and I'm golfing.  I had my whole life planned. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  So I just, I don't have time for this.  And they're looking at me like, we're not even asking you anything.  When was it?  How old were you?  Like, how long ago was it?  When we were off the air, so what, seven, eight years ago?  You didn't even have a job to go to?  No, I know.  I'm not eligible to do it.  I can't do it.  I'm a shitty citizen.  I really am a shitty citizen when it comes down to it.  What do you mean you're not eligible?  I'm a celebrity.  Do you say that?  Yes.  I say, I can't be on this case.  I'm a celebrity. 
[00:04:30]  Does that work?  I make that face to close my eyes.  Celebrity privilege.  See, all that works in the end, but there is a new thing, I'll say it again, where they  know you're using one of the things, but they're going to make you fucking way.  They'll keep you for, at least for the day.  They'll put you back in the big room where everyone's snoring and doing fucking Sudoku  puzzles.  And I guess you can check your phones now, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can go on your phones and iPads.  You used to not be able to.  Well, seven, eight years ago was sort of when it was all, what were you going to check for? 
[00:05:00]  Right.  A dumb text?  Yeah.  There was nothing to check on your phone eight years ago?  Yeah, and then they tell you to dress appropriately, but I mean, there were actually people who  showed up in nice clothes because they were going to court, and I couldn't imagine why  you would, they're going to be the ones that are picked.  Of course.  Who wants to be picked?  No one wants to be picked.  Some people do, though.  You think?  I wouldn't mind if I didn't have a morning job and it was a decent case.  Like, I would like to do it once in my life.  I've never done it, and I would love to do it once, but not on like an OJ trial, but 
[00:05:30]  something that lasts for a couple days.  There was a part of me that like, right before I got there, there was no, I didn't want to  be on the jury at all, I wanted to get it over with, but once I got in there, part  of me wanted to be on the jury to make sure justice was served.  Oh, shut up, Sam.  There was no one.  Dick.  Plus, I saw other people.  Fuck justice.  I saw other people being picked, and something in me wants to be picked at that point.  As anything.  You want to be picked at anything.  Yeah.  I want to win.  I felt like I was losing if I didn't get picked.  You're the fat kid at the dodgeball game. 
[00:06:00]  You're competitive, even in jury duty.  Yes.  That's stupid.  I couldn't stand, because I want, before I got to jury duty, I just wanted to be back  at work, but once I was there, I couldn't understand why they would pick somebody who  wasn't me.  I'm extremely competitive, but when it comes to jury duty, I want to be the fat chick  that's rejected.  Yes.  Simple as that.  Fuck that.  You've got to pick and choose when you want to be competitive.  I can't help it.  All of a sudden, I just realized that I wanted to give the, I was prepared to give bad answers  so they wouldn't pick me.  Right.  And then, I mean, if I hadn't said, I worked for the Opie and Anthony show, I probably 
[00:06:30]  would have been picked, because I was trying.  You've got to be careful, though.  They know all the things that everyone tries.  Yeah.  That's why I'm telling you the best way is to act out.  Just act out.  I don't have time for this.  That's what I said.  You said it in just the middle of everything?  Yeah, because I was starting to heat up inside, because I'm like, oh my god, I'm getting closer  to being picked.  I don't want this for myself.  It's jury duty.  It's not like a job.  I understand.  You'd be there for a week, maybe.  And then what happens is I have to act out. 
[00:07:00]  I try to keep it all inside, and then I just act it out.  It wasn't even planned.  I don't want this for myself.  Like, this is where your career is going.  I'm going to be on jury duty.  Because then I'm listening, and I forgot, because it was like eight years ago, it was some drunk  driving accident, and I think somebody was injured badly, but they're still alive, but  their life is kind of shitty, so I'm thinking, oh my god, this is going to take fucking months  to figure out.  Uh-huh.  And that's not what you wanted for yourself.  No, not at the time.  That's not the way you saw your life going. 
[00:07:30]  It was in the middle of summer, and I was in between trips.  I was hanging out.  You didn't have a job.  Right.  You were getting paid to do nothing, and then your number comes up for jury duty, and you  have to act out like a lunatic.  Yeah.  Yeah, but yeah.  Were they talking to you when you said that?  No, of course not.  They were talking to somebody else.  Yeah, but that person was taking forever, and I'm like...  You had nothing to do.  And I'm counting.  There's like 20-something of us in the room.  I'm like, that person's taking forever.  It's going to be at least another 16 people I've got to watch before they even decide if 
[00:08:00]  I might move on to the next round.  Would you get called if you just tried to give the perfect answer?  Like, are you able to be fair and impartial?  Absolutely, with everything in my life.  Completely fair and impartial.  And I do not read the newspapers, ever.  I don't know what's going on.  Like, if you tried too hard to give the right answer, they'd probably know you were lying,  and they haven't seen that one before, so they'd boot you.  That's right.  They would probably boot you.  Yeah.  They know.  They just know by looking at you.  But if you act out, man, that's the best thing.  And for the people out there, just say you work for the show.  That, yeah.  Just give, like... 
[00:08:30]  That helps.  Give regular answers, but if you tell them...  But you know what?  That didn't help in my case.  I'm trying to remember, because I filled out the form they give you.  Yeah.  No one actually asked me.  I guess that's what I was waiting for in that room, when they finally look at your form.  But I'm like, they're not going to look at my form until at least tomorrow at this point.  And this is not how you envisioned your life going at this point.  No.  That you would have to spend two days.  Honesty sucks sometimes, huh?  At jury duty. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And then the guy next to me also didn't get picked, but I think that was because right  after I said that that's the show I worked for, he was like, oh, it's a hilarious show,  bro.  So he didn't get picked either.  I thought you were going to say he said, me too.  I work for them too.  I'm a producer.  He just was like, oh, that's awesome.  Like, everybody chuckled and he was like, like he was bringing the point to the table.  Hilarious show though, dude.  Nice.  All right.  Well, welcome back, I guess.  I thought we finally lost you. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  No.  I booted you out the door so you can make real money for another company.  Does it bother you though that they had you there and that you really were trying and  they said, you know what?  Maybe he is fair, but he's just not the man for us.  He's not what we want right now.  He's just not what we want to decide these real facts.  Because I knew, what was the case?  It was some woman who tripped on the sidewalk and she was suing the city.  That would take months.  But I knew.  You don't have time for that shit.  But why was she suing the city?  That's what I wanted to find out. 
[00:10:00]  She's clumsy.  No, but I knew that I wouldn't, I wouldn't think that.  Oh, I would.  I would listen to the facts and find out whether she was clumsy or whether the city was at  fault.  Here's the facts that matter.  As you were approaching the sidewalk, did they build it?  Yeah.  No, it was already there.  You're clumsy.  Nothing, bitch.  Only if they constructed it as your foot was lifting.  I hope you get picked and it's one of these fucking, you're sequestered in a hotel room  for a year type trials. 
[00:10:30]  God, I wish that for you, Sam.  I would have wanted, not only would I have wanted to get picked, but if I were on the  jury, I would want to be the jury foreman.  I would want to be the guy.  You're like a goody two-shoes.  Well, if somebody's getting picked, I want it to be me for whatever.  Oh, somebody wants to be the foreman, guys.  I want to be the jury foreman.  Just look to me for guidance and leadership.  Hey, guys.  I can do it.  Hey, guys, we're 12 angry men.  Yeah, exactly.  We have to get this together.  It's a great movie.  11 angry men that twink.  You get to call your mother.  Mom, what do you think? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I'll tell you right now, if I'm stuck, though, I'll be the one holdout that just fucking  wrecks everyone's weekend.  No, I think he's not guilty.  Yeah, I would now have to be an asshole and have to bring everyone down to my level.  Just because you're upset that you got picked?  Fuck yeah.  Now you're all going to be.  Because I'll go, remember when I said in the big room I don't have time for this?  Well, all right.  I'm going to make time.  I'm going to make time for everybody now.  Fuck yeah.  A friend of mine did get out of jury duty that way, who was, at the time, a police officer.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:11:30]  And he didn't want to be on the jury.  Uh-oh.  But they picked him, and they suffered the consequences.  What happened?  I don't know if I'm at liberty to say it, but I'll find out.  Oh, fuck.  That's a great tease.  If our friend, Kenny might remember the guy.  I don't know if Kenny remembers the guy.  Mars, can you grab Kenny?  What is Kenny doing?  He's not listening to the show.  What is he?  No, he's probably just, he always prints out my show information and stuff.  Oh, all right.  I wanted to ask you about Atlanta and all that other stuff. 
[00:12:00]  As soon as we get past Sam's shit.  I don't know if you remember.  We're talking about jury duty.  And did you, there was a, you told me there was a guy who was on jury duty.  He was a police officer, but he didn't want to be on jury duty.  And they picked him anyway, and he got out of it.  Do you remember that case?  Or is that, am I crazy?  Well, I had a similar incident once.  Where, um, a guy I knew, it wasn't me.  Right, I don't remember the guy's name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a police officer, and he got a subpoena for jury duty. 
[00:12:30]  Cops used to be, you know, immune to that.  But then, you know, they have such a shitty jury pool that they got cops on civil cases.  So, so this cop went to the courthouse, and it was a Monday morning.  And he went to see the jury foreman and said, like, look, I'm a cop.  Like, I can't be here.  You got to get me out of here.  And the guy's like, oh, look, it's Monday morning.  I'm really jammed, you know, because there was a new jury pool.  He goes, just hang out for an hour or two until the dust clears. 
[00:13:00]  And then, you know, I'll excuse the guy.  Well, this cop, this is a long story, G.H.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I don't give a fuck.  So this cop, it was just his luck.  His fucking number got picked on the first thing.  And then he had to go with a jury into the courtroom.  And, you know, they pick your number with, like, a bingo wheel kind of thing.  Oh.  You know.  And then this fucking cop, just his luck again, he got picked in the first selection and was on the jury. 
[00:13:30]  So, like, and now the judge comes and the lawyers go to disqualify, you know.  And it was a civil case, an auto accident.  An old lady had hit a young kid, all right.  And the old lady's.  How young, 10-year-old or an adult kid?  No, like an adult.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I shouldn't say that.  I'm just, like, too old.  But.  And the old lady's insurance company stipulated that it was their fault and they was going to pay for everything. 
[00:14:00]  But this kid was looking to cash in.  He wanted, like, pain and suffering, all right.  And so, like, they're, like, disqualifying people and that cop was raising his hand, like, for everything.  Like, if you've got a problem with this, that, or the other thing, he was raising his hand.  He was trying everything.  And they wouldn't disqualify him.  So then, like, they were, like, questioning other jurors around him and they were disqualifying other jurors.  And every time another juror disqualified, this cop would go, oh, and, like, shuffle in his seat. 
[00:14:30]  That's me.  You know.  And they still wouldn't disqualify him.  And then, you know, he got stuck on the trial.  Oh, wow.  Which consisted of two expert witnesses.  One for, you know, the plaintiff and one for the defendant.  And then, like, and then, you know, this stupid testimony and then the judge has to charge the jury and explain how justice is blind and the scales of justice and, you know, preponderance of the evidence. 
[00:15:00]  And it doesn't even have to be unanimous decision.  And then they vote to pick a jury foreman.  And then they go in the jury room.  And now, like, this was just after, like, the OJ trial when, like, court TV was big and all these fucking jurors thought they were going to make a difference.  You know.  And, like, so the jury foreman goes, well, maybe we should discuss the case.  And the cop goes, there's nothing to discuss. 
[00:15:30]  It doesn't have to be unanimous decision.  So let's fucking vote.  And if the decision doesn't come out, then I'll discuss it with them.  Or he'll discuss it with them.  Well, the cop in the moment said that I'll discuss it with them.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he did because he wouldn't say no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you had a vote.  You know, does the guy get money?  And if so, how much?  Two questions.  All right.  And I said, look, I go, the kid, like, his family owned the pizzeria. 
[00:16:00]  And he was, like, standing up spinning pizzas for, like, 12 hours a day.  And he was claiming his back hurts.  I'm going, like, yeah, you stand up for 12 hours and you do some hard work.  Your fucking back is going to hurt.  But he wasn't Christopher Reeves in a wheelchair.  The cop said all this, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, the kid, you know, he was just, like, a punk, like, young guy.  You know, and you could see, like, he was making faces when, like, you know, the other expert witness was, you know, testifying. 
[00:16:30]  So I said, you saw the kid's demeanor.  You know, he's all right.  He said.  He said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said, you know, pronoun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I have a hard time talking to the third party.  Third.  Third party.  Third.  So what happened?  The cops.  So, yeah.  So they took the vote.  And he didn't get nothing.  You know.  So then the cop goes, like, out.  And the court officer's like, hey, you got to stay.  We're done.  Get the judge. 
[00:17:00]  And they're going, the judge didn't even have a cup of coffee yet.  It's like, too bad.  Get the judge.  Like, we're out of here.  That cop's got a life.  You know.  So then they, like, make him wait a half hour because I guess the judge wanted his cup of coffee anyway.  And then the cop had to, like, listen to all these fucking weirdos and all their, like, stories about, you know, their mundane lives.  Do you think the cop made the people in the jury room uncomfortable?  Yeah, because the cop was just pacing the whole time.  Do you think the cop's energy really wrecked the experience for all of them? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then we come out.  Kind of like the energy on this radio show right now.  I feel like I'm in that room with the cop.  With the officer.  With the officer.  And then the funny thing is, walking down the hall, the cop took the elevator down with the plaintiff and his attorney.  And the cop asked the attorneys, like, why don't you excuse the cop? 
[00:18:00]  And the attorney goes, no, cops are inherently, like, trustworthy and, you know, reliable and honest.  And the cop says, you know, if it wasn't for me, those dummies on the jury would have, you know, gave your client some money.  And then the doors open on the elevator.  You know, the cop saw the guy looking at his attorney in disbelief and the cop just walked out. 
[00:18:30]  The cop told the lawyer in front of the client that I'm the reason your guy didn't get money.  Yeah.  There's our justice system at work.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Very nice.  But anyone who obviously doesn't want to be there, who really obviously doesn't want to.  But most people don't want to be there.  Right?  Yeah, I guess not.  Yeah.  I don't know what the numbers are.  Maybe we could get a lawyer.  Maybe most people don't.  If someone wants to be there too bad, it might be a problem, too.  True.  So they got to figure that shit out.  Like, people were sitting there in the room visibly with their fingers crossed that they 
[00:19:00]  weren't going to be amongst the 12 that were selected from.  That's normal.  What gets you out of it?  Like, if you legitimately have to work.  I mean, see, I travel.  If you travel, then they'll give you, you can go up to the office and they'll push it back.  They'll delay it.  They won't, like, just cancel it out.  It's travel or medical.  Okay.  Like, there's no...  What if you're, like, a single mom or something, though?  Yeah, it's financial hardship also.  Financial hardship. 
[00:19:30]  Okay, that's what it's called.  Yeah.  All right.  But I think they have, like, a daycare facility in the courthouse now.  I wouldn't know one of those animals fucking watching my kid.  Sam, did you judge someone?  Did I judge someone?  You weren't listening.  Kenny, we did all this already.  No, I wasn't selected, unfortunately.  He wasn't picked.  That's why he's here.  Yeah, look at him.  They asked me to be on jury duty.  I'm like, I'm not getting that in my shoes.  Oh.  Duty.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:20:00]  Duty.  It's so stupid.  It's not stupid, Sam.  Yes, it is.  No, Peppy's the greatest.  That was an old joke of Jim Norton's, unfortunately.  It was close to one.  I was really new.  I said something about how he stepped in jury duty.  It was terrible.  That's like 1990.  Well, you certainly didn't do that joke in Atlanta.  The cop had an old joke like that also.  Of course he did.  What was the cop's old joke?  Yeah, you know him pretty well.  He sounds like a real horse's ass, this guy.  When does the cop stink?  When he's on duty. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you.  Or radio.  Really?  Look at me.  He's all proud of himself.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  All right.  But no, getting back to Atlanta.  What happened now?  James did a great job.  It was phenomenal.  Yeah, I saw it on Twitter, man.  People were digging it.  Thursday was decent.  Yeah.  Friday was mobbed, and all three Saturdays were sold out.  So Atlanta's a great market for this show.  Atlanta's great.  We were supposed to work there.  We said no.  I did some local press help.  The regular guys have a big following.  Kid Chris has a big following. 
[00:21:00]  He's on there a year.  He's doing really well.  Kid Chris is now in Atlanta?  Dude, fuck it.  I can't follow this guy anymore.  I thought he was in Portland.  No, he was.  I feel like Kid Chris is actually setting up where he knows I'm going to be.  Right.  And just establishing an audience to help me when I get there.  Holy.  Wait.  Everywhere I go, he's there.  I can't even keep track.  How many cities has he been in since Philly?  I met Chris in Sacramento many years ago when we were off.  Right.  And we knew him in Philly, of course.  Right.  And I saw him in Portland recently, and now he is in Atlanta and doing well.  And I forget.  There's been another location. 
[00:21:30]  Holy fuck.  I can't believe when I said, oh, you're doing Kid Chris?  I'm like, wow.  It's so funny when I'm on the road and I see his name pop up.  They just can't kill him.  No.  They've killed just about every other radio show.  They can't kill Kid Chris.  He's doing the same show, too.  I mean, it's like.  Good for him.  It's still fucking.  I was just looking at the ratings for New York radio, and it's sad, man.  It's terrible.  It's all like news.  Your top morning shows in New York City, it's news, light FM.  The first show that sort of has a personality is Z100, and they don't even really have a 
[00:22:00]  personality either anymore.  Well, I listen to what these guys still can say like in Atlanta, and they can't go crazy.  Under the radar shit.  But the stuff they can do is just, they can be funny on those shows.  Like, they let you be funny, too.  Right.  They're not panicking about every single.  Right.  Oh, no.  That might be Asian.  You know, as long as you're not doing FCC shit.  Right.  It was fun, man.  Can you do Asian shit?  Because Asian shit was in the news.  We're going to talk about that in a minute or two.  I'm trying to think if we did any Asian. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  I don't remember feeling like I needed to shy away from it.  Good for you.  But I mean, I don't know if it came up.  Dude, yesterday you tweeted your fucking arm.  Are you all right?  Yeah, fine.  Can I see it live?  Sure.  I'm good.  That's a good bruise, man.  Check out Jim Norton's Twitter.  Is it on our Facebook yet, Iraq?  Yes, it is.  John Jones came in here and beat the shit out of everyone, basically.  It does look like a cock and balls.  That's hilarious.  Everyone's tweeting that.  Look, it's a penis on your arm. 
[00:23:00]  That looks like a penis tattoo.  Two balls in the fucking shaft.  Yeah.  Why did it come out that way?  Because he punches.  First of all, he's a lefty.  I'm trying to think how his fist went in.  I'm looking at.  Does it hurt when you touch it?  Nah, I'm fine.  It's like the lower part where his pinky finger is, is where the balls are.  I don't know.  You'd think that's where the thumb would have hit.  But it's where the.  Right.  That was a great punch. 
[00:23:30]  But he wasn't standing either.  If he was standing, I would have hurt.  I got to tell you, I mean, the picture you tweeted is obviously impressive.  But seeing it, seeing it in person.  Wow.  It's even darker in person.  It's hard to get.  Really dark.  Yeah.  It's a good bruise.  So it's on our Facebook page.  When John Bones on Twitter, John Jones, of course, the champion, punched Jimmy.  He said it was a 70% punch.  Yeah.  I believe it.  And he was sitting down, too, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, God, yeah.  If he was standing doing a 70%, probably he would have knocked me.  He would have definitely knocked me down.  Right. 
[00:24:00]  He probably would have.  I tightened up so it wouldn't hit.  We'd have a little bit of cushion before the bone.  Right.  But, you know, if he wanted to, he could probably break your arm with a punch.  Holy fuck, that's a good bruise.  Yeah.  Go to our Facebook page.  What is it?  Opie and Anthony on Facebook?  Yeah.  I would love to get another one.  I want to get Chuck to hit me.  What do you mean you would love to get another one?  I don't mind that.  You like pain, don't you?  It's not that I like pain, but it's in the arm.  It's okay.  It's not going to do any damage if they're hitting you.  You know, just a punch in the arm is okay.  It's stung, isn't it?  Sure.  But I mean, you know.  Yeah, but you held back like, all right, that was good. 
[00:24:30]  If I would have yelled if I wanted to, I mean, I'm not afraid to go, ah, you know, I'm cool  doing that.  But a punch in the arm, as long as they don't hit you like on the bone or on the fore, you  know.  Imagine in between the bicep and the tricep right there.  Yeah, that would hurt.  Holy fuck, that would hurt.  But he punched me pretty much.  I tightened up, so it was mostly on the.  It looks like a penis.  That's hilarious.  It does.  People were tweeting that, and I'm like, all right.  Yeah.  Or a guitar.  A guitar?  A double neck?  Yeah.  Double neck guitar?  Yeah, I just look at it sometimes when no one's around it.  I'll just put my finger in front of my arm and go. 
[00:25:00]  Chip's tattoo.  Oh, boy.  Flying.  It's going to be a long week without a ass.  I'm out here Friday, though, so you'll only have to deal with Chip.  Three days?  Yeah.  Three out of the four?  Fort Lauderdale.  It's on vacation.  People are asking.  Yeah, he's away.  He's on a boat.  He's in the middle of the ocean right now.  Are you all in with this Jeremy Lin yet, Jimmy?  I don't follow it.  I don't care.  I mean, he's just, again, just a good point guard.  Growing up with basketball and not being a Knicks fan for probably a decade, I'm watching 
[00:25:30]  the Knicks every night again, and I'm loving it, man.  I fucking love watching basketball.  The Nets beat the shit out of the Knicks last night.  Deron Williams, probably the best point guard in the league, some would say.  Most people would say.  Lit it up last night.  38 points against Jeremy Lin and the Knicks.  And Carmelo Anthony came back for the first time.  Pretty much everyone knew that they were going to lose when Anthony came back, just because 
[00:26:00]  he's rusty, and now they've got to all figure out how to play together.  Jeremy Lin didn't look that impressive last night.  It looked like he was hesitating half the game.  He was probably intimidated that the bigger guy was there.  Yeah, because Carmelo Anthony's got a name, and all of a sudden he's coming back.  It seemed like Lin was showing a little respect or something, which was fine, but he should  have just played how he's been playing the last eight, nine games, and let Anthony figure  it out.  Anthony is going to figure it out.  But with the Jeremy Lin thing, we've got some controversy.  Did you see the mobile app thing? 
[00:26:30]  Yes, I did.  Where a guy in charge of the ESPN mobile app thing wrote a chink in the armor when the  Knicks finally lost with Jeremy Lin.  Yeah, and it was a picture of him, and didn't it say his name after two?  Where's the actual headline?  The headline, chink in the armor, Jeremy Lin's nine turnovers cost Knicks in streak-stopping  loss to Hornets, appeared on ESPN's mobile website at 2.30 a.m. on Saturday, and was removed 
[00:27:00]  by 3.05.  I screen capped that shit and sent it out.  So it was only up there for a half hour?  Wow, man, I didn't know that.  Fuck, that's showing responsibility.  What do you think?  Well, the guy...  Me and Jimmy basically, before the show, said the guy should have been fired, but we're  in a tough spot because we don't believe anyone should be fired for pretty much anything at  this point.  But knowing the culture we live in and how this shit works out, that was taking a massive 
[00:27:30]  fucking chance.  So we're thinking, of course he was going to get fired for this.  But he's saying he's used it at least a hundred times in headlines over the years and thought  nothing of it when he slapped it on the Lin story.  But, I mean, chink, Lin, I mean, you know, what is he trying to say?  Was it him being...  It's hard to imagine he wasn't being cute.  But I got to stop myself because I said...  I should have said he should have been fired. 
[00:28:00]  What I should have said was, of course he was going to get fired for this.  You know, you got to understand the culture we live in to a point.  I kind of felt like he should have been, and I'll tell you why.  Should have been.  Yeah.  But not because he used the word chink in a headline.  Like, if it was, again, if it was Carmelo Anthony and he said, is there a chink in the  armor?  That's a real expression.  Right.  But if you do it, and you put him there, and this is like when he's just starting and  everybody's talking about it, it's one of those, like, weird things where we know what  you're doing. 
[00:28:30]  You can get out of it by playing a semantics game.  I go, well, technically I didn't know technically.  We understand that.  Right.  But we also understand what we use in language.  Right.  And that...  I'm not explaining myself very well, but I think that it was done purposely.  That's my opinion.  I think if you're trying to be clever or trying to be funny, you know, then you should be  left alone.  You know what I mean?  Like, nappy-headed hoe, once again, Imus wasn't going for hate speech. 
[00:29:00]  Imus was going for a fucking joke.  Period.  And I think that's the difference, right?  Yeah.  Reading the story.  See, now it's just getting...  Now it's just getting to a point where the Asian groups can shut the fuck up, where they're  going to start calling it the C-word, which we all know is cunt, not chink.  Yeah, they're trying to take over the C-word.  C-word is taken.  Yeah.  C-word's taken by the cunts. 
[00:29:30]  But now...  Yes.  The Asians want it for chink.  You can't have that.  The cunts got that one.  The cunts.  The cunts got the C-word.  Now they're going to...  What is it, a politician?  Of Judy Chu, which her last name, I guess, is not the C-word.  Judy Chu.  I can't use the expression at all.  See, chink in the armor will not be used at all.  It's almost like there's a word, I believe it's niggardly, it means stingy.  What's the exact definition of niggard?  N-I-G-G-A-R-D-L-Y.  I think you nailed it.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  And I don't think that that word should be banned, and I think you should be able to  use it in mixed company.  Right.  But I think that if you're writing a headline, and let's say you have a picture of Carmelo  Anthony throwing the ball, or some black player, and you say, Anthony makes niggardly decision.  Right.  Maybe he was stingy with ball passing.  All right, with a gun to your head, we couldn't execute you.  Right.  But we all know what you're...  Right.  You're taking a little bit of a chance there.  I don't believe it's an accident. 
[00:30:30]  Well, I didn't realize that it was only on the ESPN mobile app for a half hour.  That shows responsibility, like, oh, fuck, this is not good, and they removed it immediately,  whether it was the guy who had that responsibility or one of the higher-ups.  But it's in the middle of the night, so I'm thinking the guy...  One of his higher-ups probably realized it.  ...removed it immediately.  If the guy who wrote it removed it immediately, then, I don't know, I would like to see this  guy get a pass, but it's too late because the ESPN fired him. 
[00:31:00]  Can we see other headlines he's done?  Like, he said he's used it a hundred times.  Let me read the story, because there's a lot in here.  Uh, let's see.  The ESPN editor fired Sunday for using Chicken in the Armor in a headline about Nick's phenom.  Jeremy Lin said the racial slur never crossed his mind, and he was devastated when he realized  his mistake.  Never crossed his mind?  Do you believe that one, Jimmy?  He's explaining it, like, the way you should explain it.  But what I don't like is...  As soon as I saw Chink in the Armor, I'm like, oh, fuck, man. 
[00:31:30]  I understand what he's saying here, but, you know, you're absolutely taking a chance.  He's saying things like, uh...  This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny, Anthony Federico told the Daily News.  I'm so sorry that I offended people.  I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy.  Uh, the headline, Chicken in the Armor, Jeremy Lin's nine turnovers cost Nixon streak-stopping  lost to Hornets, appeared on ESPN's mobile website at 2.30, and was removed by 3.05 in  the middle of the night, so it was up there for a half hour, but in this day and age,  everyone's screen capping their asses off, so then it was all over the place all day 
[00:32:00]  long on Sunday.  Now that...  See, now what the Asian groups will try to do is have the word chink removed, even when  you want to say something completely, like, a legitimate use of it.  Right.  And, uh, we talked about it, and you had said it way back when they were trying to put  nigger to bed for good, when you remove words from the language, it's just not going to  stop, because everybody wants the power of having removed the word.  Right.  Of course.  And then...  This guy was an asshole to use it, but...  Battling... 
[00:32:30]  Battling to contain a furor, the Sports Network fired Federico and suspended anchor Max  Britos for 30 days because it turned out he had used the same expression on the air last  week.  We do have that audio.  And he used it in reference to Lin.  Right.  We have it.  Here's the ESPN anchor, uh, who used the same chink in the armor, uh, 30 days ago.  But he used it 30 days ago, and, uh, there was no uproar.  They just went back ESPN.  They're just trying to clean up everything before it gets too crazy.  But the guy used it 30 days ago, and I don't remember hearing... 
[00:33:00]  Jeremy Lin wasn't playing 30 days ago, was he?  Uh, well, all right, let me...  Maybe it wasn't about Jeremy Lin, though.  Because 30 days ago, it certainly wasn't...  It certainly wasn't Lin's sanity.  No.  Here's the ESPN anchor.  He's handled everything very well, as you said, unflappable.  But if there is a chink in the armor, where can Lin improve his game?  Yeah, it's about...  Okay.  Uh, no.  You confused me there, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  He was suspended for 30 days.  Right, okay.  So he used this recently for, as far as Jeremy Lin goes, as well. 
[00:33:30]  That's, that's...  When I was a little kid...  There's a million other ways to say that, so that's where my problem's at.  I would say things like, oh, shucks!  Because I like the...  It sounded like fuck.  Right.  And there's sometimes when you say...  You know what you're doing, or it just sounds right, or you're trying to get away with it,  you don't even realize you're doing it.  Right.  But it's like...  Chink in the armor is a real expression.  Right.  It's like a little nick in your armor.  We've all said it, but...  Right. 
[00:34:00]  How do you not know?  There's very few Asian players, so it's like, you gotta know when you're describing...  He even said, there's a chink in the armor, where can Lin...  Right.  It's like you're trying to get away with it.  But when they're doing, um, stories about other guys and stuff, I never hear chink in  the armor.  You know what I mean?  Well, that's why...  Can we Google this guy's headlines?  Is there more?  I was looking at...  Uh, Federico28 said he understands why he was axed.  Uh, ESPN did what they had to do.  He said, he is fucking bummed.  See, I hate the way he's...  To me, if you really didn't do it...  Like, if you wrote chink in the armor about another player and they fired you, you should 
[00:34:30]  be outraged.  Right.  If he didn't do it on purpose, he should say, this is an outrage.  This is a real expression.  This is a politically correct witch hunt.  And I had...  It was not done.  He should fight back harder.  He said he used it a hundred times.  And that's something you can look up.  So, uh...  He used it a hundred times over the years and thought nothing of it when he slapped it  on the Lin story.  Federico called Lin one of his heroes, not just because he's a big Knicks fan, but because  he feels a kinship with a fellow outspoken Christian.  Oh, boy. 
[00:35:00]  He's trying a little too hard here.  My faith is my life.  He said, I'd love to tell Jeremy what happened and explain that this was an honest mistake.  I had a career that I was proud of more than Federico, who worked at ESPN.  Since getting his start there in 2006, I'm devastated that I caused a firestorm.  He is bummed.  A gracious Lin, who led the Knicks to another dazzling hardwood victory Sunday gave Federico.  And Britos, the benefit of the doubt.  Britos is, of course, the anchor we just played that got 30-day suspension.  They have apologized, and so from my end, I don't care anymore, Lin said. 
[00:35:30]  You have to learn to forgive, and I don't even think that was intentional.  Well, that's cool.  Yeah, Jeremy Lin's not being a baby about it.  That's cool.  But Judy Chu and some other twat in a special interest group will be outraged.  Jeremy Lin just is like, ah, fuck it.  When the anchor said it, the moment passed almost entirely without notice.  A video replay suggests Britos was not trying to be funny, but made a poor choice of words there.  He tweeted his apology Saturday, saying he meant no racial reference, but would be extra careful in the future. 
[00:36:00]  My wife is Asian, Britos says.  And he would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and the community.  That saved him, by the way.  It didn't save JV and Elvis, because he's married to a really beautiful Asian girl, but that's what saved him.  Because radio sucks.  Well, I mean, radio does suck, yes.  No, they're a step lower when it comes to all this shit.  Yeah.  He was saved because he has an Asian wife, and they have video of his face when he said it.  Right.  And he probably didn't say it with malice.  Right.  And there was no uproar, too.  They went back.  ESPN showed responsibility, like, holy fuck, we're firing this guy for that headline. 
[00:36:30]  We got to go back, because we know, you know, Max here used the same exact, you know, saying.  Wow, yeah, real guys network, ESPN.  Just fucking stand by your guys.  Never.  Never, never, never, never, never.  Because now that I know this guy used it a hundred times, obviously, Jeremy Lin, Chink in the Armour, it's a little too close.  But if he used it a hundred times, and it was only up there for a half hour, you go, holy fuck, we made a mistake, but this guy's a good employee.  We don't want to lose him.  I want to see other headlines he had it with. 
[00:37:00]  I haven't found any yet.  Yeah, maybe someone's got, and I know they're going to call up, you guys are hypocrites.  You always say people shouldn't get fired, and now you're saying he should be fired.  You guys are hypocrites.  Like, I know those guys are going to come in.  I don't think he should have gotten fired, but, you know, but you've got to understand the culture we live in, where people are going to be, like, outraged and try to get your job.  And then most of these companies, they're very wimpy, and they're not going to stand up for their people.  That's what I'm saying.  He should have known better, I think.  The reason I'm comfortable with them being fired is I don't want to be, I don't want to go so far in the other direction. 
[00:37:30]  Like, I hate PC thinking so much that I don't want to be blinded to when somebody really does something shitty and fireable.  Because there are fireable offenses in language.  It doesn't mean that you can say, you know, hey, it was almost like, let's say there's two back players, and the expression was something spooks the team, or look at these spooks, or something that was so obviously borderline.  Where you could use a whole bunch of other words, like, decide to go with spook in that case. 
[00:38:00]  I think the guy made an honest mistake.  If he did, then he should have been fired, but I don't believe he did.  That's what we did here.  You don't believe.  Nah, I think.  You think he went for it.  I don't think you cannot know it, especially with his picture there.  And the other guy even saying, like, if there's a chink in the arm or Lynn, it's like, how could you not make it?  You couldn't be that stupid.  Well, they're all trying to be clever with this dumb Lynn shit, too, man.  You see the headline, just because they lost to the Nets.  What does the paper say over there? 
[00:38:30]  Turn your daily news over.  Chink loses.  Trouble.  I said Marshmallow, because Anthony Carmelo could.  No, well, he's a little rusty.  But they do think, see, that kind of works against the ESPN guy.  There it is.  Trouble Lynn Paradise.  They work in.  Trouble Lynn Paradise, so they go Trouble Lynn Paradise, because they lost to the Nets last night.  They work in puns, and they work in wordplay.  Like, they.  So sometimes I think they're trying to be too clever for the room, and they're working a little too hard.  That's why I'm suspicious that this was an honest mistake. 
[00:39:00]  Sam, what do you want?  Oh, Travis came in.  Well, I know you want to, like, find this guy's other headlines and stuff, but headline writers aren't credited.  Like, you'll never know who wrote Marshmallow.  There's just a bunch of guys who just write headlines.  Can you write something about ESPN chink in the arm?  That's going to be incredibly hard to find, because there's millions and millions of search results right now.  That just deal with that story.  If he's written chink in the armor before on ESPN.com, they've completely removed anything that has the word chink in it.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Because the search will just come up with nothing.  Yeah, they're panicking.  Yeah.  Of course they're not.  So if he said it, then we're not going to find it.  And then here we go to the politician.  Jeremy Linsler, Asian-American politician, slams ESPN editor for using C word.  The cunts got the C word.  I'm going to say that a million times.  You can't steal the C word.  I like that the cunts have become a special interest group.  Yes.  What?  Well, how else do you say it?  They need to be represented.  The Asians want the C word.  You can't have this.  You could have the chow word or the ch word. 
[00:40:00]  But the C word is taken.  By who?  Huh?  By who?  The cunts.  The cunts got that one.  We said this, too.  They're going to take a million words away from us.  That's why we had to defend this from the beginning.  But half these dummies on the radio decided to go, yeah, I'm going to be fired.  Fucking idiots.  An Asian-American politician says the C word is just as bad as the N word when it comes to racial slurs.  And she is letting ESPN off the hook for using the term to describe NBA breakout star Jeremy Lin. 
[00:40:30]  The use of that term is appalling and offensive, Congresswoman Judy Chu said Monday on MSNBC, referring to the controversial headline, Chick in the Armor.  While ESPN has since apologized for the headline and the editor who wrote it was swiftly fired.  And this is where these politicians have got to fucking relax.  Chu refuses to write off the word choice as a mistake.  The C word is for Asian-Americans like the N word is for African-Americans, the California Democrats said. 
[00:41:00]  If he was using it all those times, that is extremely sad because it came out that he used it over 100 times.  Why is it extremely sad if he used it 100 times?  That's why she's hateable.  This is the first fucking time that it was close, very close to an Asian player, I would assume.  I would assume, right?  Out of the 100 times, this is probably maybe one, the only time it was used for an Asian player.  You dope.  The word was used since the 1880s to demean Chinese-Americans and to deprive them of their rights. 
[00:41:30]  And it's used on playgrounds specifically to humiliate and to offend Asian-Americans.  So I don't know where he's been all this time.  And this is why Judy Chu is a cunt.  Because what she's doing now is she's saying that the word chink is wrong in any context.  Right.  She's saying it's – if he's been using it all these times, that's extremely sad.  No, it's not extremely sad because chink in the armor is a completely valid expression. 
[00:42:00]  A little chink in paint or something does not mean there's a Chinese guy on your fucking paint or in your armor.  Right.  It's not about a Chinese knight.  Right.  It's stupid.  Right.  That's where she annoys me.  And she doesn't think ESPN has done enough.  Of course not.  Because she's like –  They apologized and they got rid of the guy.  She's like John Liu, another fucking special interest parasite.  Right.  Who is going to try to lock on and get what they can from the network to bullhorn their message.  You know what?  And we got to blame the company again.  Yep.  These fucking wimpy companies that just fucking cater to these special interest groups. 
[00:42:30]  They're faggot lawyers.  Know what you should do if you're ESPN?  Go, no, Judy Chu.  We did everything we're going to do in this situation and we're moving on and you should move on with your dumb life.  Period.  It's Disney.  They fold fast.  Well, watch.  They're not going to move on.  They're not going to tell her.  They're going to have to cater to her now.  Because that's what the companies do.  Disney apologizes.  They apologize again.  And then she'll feel important.  Like John Liu did. 
[00:43:00]  I love the fact that it looks like John Liu is having some trouble.  Whatever it is, I hope it's a medical problem and a fucking political problem.  These guys are the worst.  And Lin is okay with it.  He's fine with it.  Lin's totally okay with it and wants to just move on.  Oh, God.  Another one of these.  It seems like there's one of these every day now.  Every day.  Travis spilled milk on his crotch.  Good.  It's coffee.  What do you mean milk?  I wish it was acid. 
[00:43:30]  So there you go.  Were we all over the place there?  I'm starting to think the guy should have been fired.  And you think he should have been fired because you think he...  I believe he did it on purpose.  But again, I can't allow my hatred of this Judy Chu.  Right.  This fucking twat saying C word and using little letters to cover up what words are.  I can't allow my intense hatred of her to override the fact that I think he did it on purpose and was fucked up.  You know what I mean?  Like, I can't because one, because I think he's a dummy and he was trying to be cute. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  I can't...  And I also can't forgive her.  Right.  Because she's saying, if he's using it all those times, it's extremely sad.  It's not extremely sad.  No one's crying about that.  Yeah.  All right.  There we're at.  There we're at with that shit.  Phones are lit.  You want to take a couple of these calls?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let me start from the top.  Fuck it.  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Does this mean we can't use a spade as a spade anymore or call a spade a spade? 
[00:44:30]  Well, that's where it goes.  And that's what you've got to be really careful of.  That's why when she says, if he used this word a hundred times, it's sad.  A spade as a spade is a very...  A spade shovel.  Well, can we say spade and neutered?  Because it sounds like spade, even though it's spelled differently.  That's where you've got to watch it.  We're in deep trouble with this language thing, man.  And the thing is, too, ESPN is the worst.  Yeah.  The cowards. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, you remember back when Rush Limbaugh had his thing with him, and all he was talking  about was just how the press treated black quarterbacks.  You know, they cut him loose in just a second.  I also think Rush saying that showed a lack of football knowledge.  Because he was trying to be Rush and trying to be political.  Almost like trying too hard to say something that would be true to what Rush should say.  Right.  That was a stupid point, I thought.  And ESPN got what they paid for with that, too.  Because they brought him on for shit like that, too.  Of course. 
[00:45:30]  Of course.  But now, you know, now there's two C words, I guess.  I guess there's now two C words is what we're learning today.  What do you say if it's an Asian woman that you don't like?  Yeah.  You've got a double C.  People think, is that a carbon copy?  No.  God, do I want to say that double C word right now?  Go ahead.  I'm too scared.  It would roll off the tongue nicely, though.  Steve in DC.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, I agree with Jimmy.  I think the guy did it on purpose because I believe he's using the vernacular incorrectly. 
[00:46:00]  The correct phrase is kink in the armor.  Armor back in those days was chain that was linked together.  And when it got tangled, it was called a kink.  Yeah, but there is an expression, a very valid expression called, is there a chink in the armor?  What does Wikipedia say?  There's a very, very valid expression, chink in the armor.  It is definitely.  I've heard kink in the armor more than chink in the armor myself.  Chink in the armor is a real expression.  I've heard chink. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  So you think the guy should have been fired?  I think so.  I think that he just had a moment of unclarity, if you will, and just pulled over the top.  Well, is chink in the armor a real expression?  Yes.  Yes.  Man, I mean, they're all trying to be cute with their pawns  and working linen to everything, and then this guy's like, you know what?  I could get away with this because chink in the armor is a real phrase.  I can get away with it.  It's eye-grabbing. 
[00:47:00]  But yeah, technically, I can't get in trouble for it because it fits.  Because these guys work in puns, that's why it doesn't work because it's all they do.  And we live in a world where everything is eye-grabbing, and you've got to fucking get everyone engaged immediately.  And that's the pressure he feels.  You know what I mean?  He was hoping people would see that and go, what?  Chink!  Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.  Right.  But he wanted the word to have the effect, or he wouldn't have put it.  Yeah.  But what was the value in it for him? 
[00:47:30]  I mean, on a mobile application, posting it at 2 o'clock in the morning?  Well, I mean, that's probably when they post stuff.  Yeah, because it was a couple hours after the game, and then, you know, that was going to be seen by a lot of people all day Saturday.  I don't know how many people have the mobile app, but I would assume it's millions if you're at ESPN, right?  Absolutely, yeah.  I don't know.  The PC stuff is over the top.  It's crazy.  It is.  But that doesn't mean, like, just because, again, I have to be careful because I hate PC thinking so much that if it's a legitimate fuck-up by somebody. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, there are times where a company's got to go, look, you're an idiot.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  He took a big chance there, I guess.  Yeah.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Yes.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Yeah, you too, man.  Let's go to Megan in D.C.  Megan's a regular.  I know this Megan.  Hey, the C word's ours.  I know.  I said the cunt's got the C word. 
[00:48:30]  It's for the ladies.  For the ladies.  I just want to tell you guys, like, about 10 years ago in D.C., there was a city councilman that got fired for using the word niggardly in a meeting.  I remember that.  Yeah, and there were black people in the meeting, and they got all upset.  And he was just referring to, like, a budget decision.  He wasn't even referring to.  Well, was it a white guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that goes more toward Jimmy, the guy.  You know what you're doing.  You kind of know what you're doing.  There's a million other words you could have used there, and he chose that one. 
[00:49:00]  And then his defense is what?  You know, this is a legit word.  But he wasn't even referring to black people or anything having to do with them.  It was just kind of a good vocabulary word.  I don't know.  I'm a defender of the English language.  I am, too.  All right.  So it wasn't about black people at the time?  No.  So then I don't have a problem with it at all.  Let me ask you a question, Megan.  If we were talking, right?  If we were on a date, let's just say, or out to dinner, or say we parked a car, and you  and I were chatting, and I had said something to you, like, I looked you in the eye, and 
[00:49:30]  I said, you know, a lot of times, women who go on dates with guys don't put out, and as  a result, those women are raped and killed.  And if I was looking you in the eye when I said that, wouldn't that terminology bother  you a little bit, like, ugh, what the fuck's he doing?  I'm not actually with you, Jimmy.  All right.  See, yeah, that's a great point, because I am charming.  But if it was somebody else, wouldn't it let you go, like, ugh, what is he doing?  Even though they're legitimate words and he's not threatening you, you kind of know the 
[00:50:00]  subtext of it.  I'm not sure that's a great example.  It sounds kind of like a threat.  Yeah, but even though technically it wasn't.  So sometimes things that aren't, sometimes you're saying things with a subtext, and you  would have read that immediately.  Yeah, sure.  It does sound like a threat.  Just like when you got black employees in there, unless niggardly's a word, niggardly's  not a word most people use.  No.  And we all know that.  My entire life, I've never really heard it used in a nice way.  If that guy in a budget meeting said people are getting spooked, like, look, the economy 
[00:50:30]  has got people spooked.  Right.  That's different, because that's a word everybody, you know.  Sure, sure.  Someone's asking if the guy was Asian, should he have been fired as well?  That's a, yeah.  I mean, you know, they probably would fire him anyway.  Probably, yeah.  Just because you're Asian doesn't mean that you can say it on an ESPN website.  So he should have been fired if he was Asian as well?  Yeah.  Even though I think he should have been fired, I still hate ESPN for it.  Yeah.  Megan, thank you.  Oh, wait. 
[00:51:00]  Can I just say one more thing?  Sure.  It better be nice.  There's a skit on Saturday Night Live that you guys should play.  That's exactly what you're talking about.  They make fun of all of the slurs against Asians, and then they do a bunch of slurs against blacks,  and they get fired.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I heard SNL was pretty good this weekend.  Yeah, that skit was really funny.  Was that the first skit about Linsanity?  Yeah, actually, it was.  It was the very first skit.  I heard it was pretty good.  Why don't we take a – we'll look at that.  Thanks, Megan.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Let me go to Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Yeah, look, what I think happened is this fucking dude put up a headline,  and he puts up a million times.  It was just a complete legitimate thing, chicken armor.  And then some dude probably saw it and goes, dude, really?  Jink?  Lynn?  And then he panicked and took it down, which is why I was only up for a half hour.  But why are we not getting upset at newspapers like the Daily News?  On the back page of them, they put Asian mania during their winning streak.  It's just as blatant as chink in the armor with Jeremy Allen, 
[00:52:00]  which, by the way, is a completely, perfectly valid saying.  Just because it was an Asian guy doesn't mean the guy was driving it.  I mean, if you're a reasonable guy, would you really do that  and be like, oh, I'm going to put chink and really get under people's skin?  Well, Asians do not like the word chink.  Sure.  No, I'm just breaking this down.  What's wrong with Asian mania?  What does it have to do?  And there's I'm Asian.  That has nothing to do with it.  That has nothing to do with the person's mania.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay. 
[00:52:30]  Their argument would be probably, and I understand what you're saying,  but it's like the difference.  Chink.  Everybody knows that describing, because it's a legitimate description.  It's okay.  It's acceptable to say I went on a date with an Asian woman  or my girlfriend's Asian, but if you were in a room full of people  and you said my girlfriend's a chink, everybody would look at you like,  what the fuck are you doing?  So come on, man.  You know the difference between the usage of those words.  Plus, I think it's really important to the story that he is Asian 
[00:53:00]  because there's just not a lot of Asian players in the NBA.  I couldn't even name another one right now.  I'm sure there's probably at least one more,  but it's very rare that an Asian makes it into the NBA,  so that's why that part of the story is such a big deal.  Right, but it's just a saying.  Chink in the armor.  They were saying Jeremy Lin was this kid who was going to come in there  and score 30 a night with 15 assists every night,  and the guy was saying, hey, look, he does have a chink in the armor.  He gives up a lot of turnovers.  That's really all it was. 
[00:53:30]  No, I don't believe that.  I understand the usage of the term.  And I know you're being very technical.  But living in this country, what's that?  Isn't that what it's like?  If you're a reasonable guy who has a really good job with ESPN doing headlines  and you're sitting there at 2 a.m. and you're going to go, you know what?  I'm going to put the chink thing for the Asian.  That will really get them going.  I don't think it was to get people going.  I think it was to be eye-grabbing and people go, what?  And then when they look at it, they go, oh.  It was almost like when you want to say something really naughty but then not suffer the penalty. 
[00:54:00]  And not suffering the penalty would be the legitimate use of it, like the excuse that you're giving him.  And, again, if it was black players, I would think that he was just writing as an expression.  But everyone is talking about this Lin.  And everybody is focusing on the fact that he's Asian because he's new.  When you write chink in a headline with his picture there, you know what you're doing.  Chink in the armor.  He didn't just write chink.  He didn't write the chink has a chink in his armor. 
[00:54:30]  He just wrote chink in the armor.  The guy is supposed to be this unflappable ball player.  But guess what?  He does have a ball player.  I understand the expression.  Okay, we don't agree.  I understand why you said it.  You believe it.  Okay.  I don't think.  He must be insane, right, to do that and actually think that's going to flow and that's going to be cool.  He must be nuts to do that then.  No, just stupid.  And these guys live in puns, dude.  These guys, every headline they write are puns and wordplay.  There's no way you missed that.  No, you're right.  You're right.  They do a lot of puns and wordplay. 
[00:55:00]  But seriously, that type of pun, really?  Do you really think he thought that was just going to be a completely innocuous pun?  People are going to go nuts over it?  Okay, so let me ask you.  Because Tiger Woods stands out because he's a black golfer.  It's not like the NBA.  Okay, if the headline, if Tiger, I've used this example a minute ago, had made a bad decision and it said, there's a picture of Tiger standing there with his arms up in the air and it said, Tiger acts niggardly.  Now, you could make the argument that technically, niggardly, we got it. 
[00:55:30]  But everyone would know what the intention of that was.  You'd be dishonest to say you didn't.  If he used a word like niggardly, which nobody uses with the exception of apparently a guy in a D.C. budget meeting, then, yeah, I would say he's probably going after something.  Because nobody uses that word.  But chink in the armor is part of our vernacular.  I hear that all the time for someone who has a problem where you thought they didn't.  Ryan, I want to jump in for a second. 
[00:56:00]  I've been working this out in my head for the last hour.  I think he just got caught up in the whole, you know, trying to come up with a clever pun.  Because I've been involved with this Linsanity for a week or so.  And I found myself, I'm guilty of it on Twitter.  Like, how can I come up with the clever Linn thing?  You know, the Linn pun.  You know, we've all seen Linsanity, you know, the Knicks continue to Linn.  And you're just trying to, you know, have the best one out there.  And I really think he just got caught up in that whole fucking thing, the more I think about it. 
[00:56:30]  But what about, like, okay.  I don't think there was hate behind him saying chink in the armor.  But I think he got caught up to the point where he maybe should have understood that ESPN being owned by Disney, this could be a problem.  And maybe he should have, you know, taken a step back before he actually sent that out to everybody.  He wanted to have the holy shit one.  Yeah.  He wanted the holy shit one.  We all do.  And I don't think it means, like, we're trying to go for some hate out there. 
[00:57:00]  But, I mean, this Linn thing is trending on Twitter almost every day.  And you're sitting there with your Twitter.  I see how it happens.  You're like, fuck, I want to be the one that comes up with the best one.  And he's sitting there going, holy fuck, I think I got it.  Yeah.  Chink in the armor.  This is fucking beautiful.  You know, I know what chink in the armor means.  And so I'm not going for, you know, look at this chink type of headline.  And, unfortunately, he got caught.  Yeah, but, dude, there's a difference between you put it on your Twitter or Jimmy did because that's what you guys do. 
[00:57:30]  You make jokes.  You do that type of humor.  And an ESPN website administrator, you don't – there's way big differences between the two.  I don't think that guy was going for the big joke and thought chink would just –  No, okay.  Like, in this day and age –  Wait, you think he was just –  I think he just threw it on there.  Hey, look, chink in the armor.  This guy –  Yeah, I disagree.  I think he saw everybody else trying to come up with that clever pun, and he got kind of swept up in that a little bit.  Well, then, like I said –  I don't think he didn't hate those, Ryan.  No, I don't think it was hate either, but he must be nuts to think that that would have flew them. 
[00:58:00]  But he did think it would fly because he thought that – sometimes we think that, well, I have technically – like the excuse you're giving him.  It's part of our vernacular.  It's an expression.  He –  Wait, chink.  I understand that.  But he thought that would be enough to override the shock at the headline.  I'm confused.  You wanted him fired or not fired, Ryan?  No, I don't think –  All right, because it seems like you went back and forth a little bit there.  No, Ryan thinks that he was totally mistaken, and it was a total accident that a man who makes a living doing headlines and doing puns and headlines didn't notice the Asian face with chink in the armor when everybody's talking about the guy's Asian-ness. 
[00:58:30]  I think –  I don't think it was as premeditated as you planned it out.  Yeah, okay.  I think I agree with you, Ryan.  I really do.  I think he went, wait, I think I could get away with this chink in the armor, and this will be the best Lin pun yet.  Ryan doesn't think that.  Ryan thinks it was a total accident.  No, no, no, no.  I don't think he did it for the pun.  Yeah, see, that's where I'm –  Ryan thinks it was a total accident.  No, I'm an –  That's where I'm confused by you. 
[00:59:00]  What was he trying to –  I think he said, okay, this guy Lin is blowing up the NBA scene.  Everyone thinks he can do no wrong.  They're on a huge winning streak.  Oh, wait a second.  He turned the ball over nine times.  Looks like he has a chink in the armor after all.  Just so happens he's Asian.  Okay, so you're planning all together.  No, I don't know.  It was a premeditated thing where he said, I want to go get the pun.  So you know what I'll do?  I'll call him a chink, and everyone will think that's hilarious on ESPN.  Yes.  He's on the biggest sports website in the world, and everyone will think it's awesome. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Okay.  So you think he just –  Well, you take him at face value.  Good for you.  I don't.  I don't think it's a –  I mean, the dude apologized like crazy.  Now, granted, whether that was true or not, I don't know, but he sure did come off like  he was sorry.  And Opie, I think that's where you're right, dude.  A half hour later, it was pulled off the site.  Because I think some other guy probably saw me like, really, dude, chink Jeremy Lin?  And they were like, oh, shit, you're right.  Let me pull that down.  Wow, man.  All right.  I just –  I don't believe him.  I don't think the guy's a piece of shit.  I think he was just trying to go for the eye-grabbing, holy shit headline. 
[01:00:00]  Like everybody else.  Like everybody else is.  SNL did a whole skit on it because everyone's like, fuck, I'm going to be the clever guy  with this Lin punt thing.  I don't know, Ryan.  I guess we got to just, you know, the famous agree to disagree because I don't see it.  I would agree with you guys if it weren't chink.  I don't see it.  I don't see that he was going for just, you know, a face value thing.  No way.  I think he was thinking about it.  All right, bro.  Good talk.  All right, Ryan.  Thank you, man.  See you, guys.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, this is a very good –  Mark, two more quick phone calls.  Mark, go ahead.  Marky.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, it kills me that, you know, people are getting fired over words.  That's first and foremost in my opinion.  Absolutely.  The guys are losing their jobs because they say something.  Absolutely.  What's really getting me here, though, is that it doesn't even bother him.  He's loving it.  He's in the spotlight.  He's having a great time.  He's playing ball, and it doesn't even bother him.  But yet all these people that are waiting, they're just sitting there waiting to read 
[01:01:00]  something or see something online to just jump in and kill everybody.  Yeah, the politician is basically saying, look, Jeremy Lin can't really think for himself.  He might be fine with this, but we're certainly not fine with this.  I think if the guy, Jeremy Lin, is fine with this, that should be the end of it, too.  And that should be the end of it.  He's a Harvard graduate.  I mean, he's a smart kid.  He's a smart – he's a very smart kid.  He's not a dummy.  So moving forward, I guess I can't go to the ski slopes this weekend, right?  No, I know what you do.  Next Halloween is not going to be very spooky for us, is it? 
[01:01:30]  Well, all that's going to change.  We're going to have to be so careful about everything we say.  No, no, we don't have to be that careful about what we say because, again, when we make  our living with words, we know what we're doing when we use them.  And I just don't believe that it was a mistake.  And I don't believe it's just about Jeremy Lin being offended or not because it wasn't something  that was said to Jeremy Lin in a conversation.  It wasn't said directly at him.  What's that?  It wasn't said directly at him.  So people –  Going back to what you started with, Jimmy, they're words. 
[01:02:00]  We're not putting guns to people's heads and saying, oh, my God, I'm going to shoot you.  And that's the fear.  We're fear-mongering over –  No, we're not.  I disagree.  And believe me, I defend the language to a fault.  And I defend people's right to use it.  And I defend 90% of the people who go into situations like this because I think that  it's a knee-jerk reaction to fire them.  But just because people are language policing and are cocksuckers doesn't mean that people 
[01:02:30]  never fuck up with language and have to go.  It doesn't mean that it never happens.  The way you're saying it –  They're human.  I know.  I know he's a human.  In this instance, definitely.  You know, he knew in the back of his head, I'm throwing a word chink out there.  Let's see if I can get away with it.  You know what I mean?  And I completely agree with that.  Right.  There was no –  There was no, you know, I didn't mean it.  It wasn't – you know, it's a real saying.  I get all that.  Yeah.  And it's just – I don't know.  More than anything, we can go on about it for hours.  It just frigging kills me that people are losing their jobs and getting suspended because 
[01:03:00]  they say something.  I think this SNL skit's going to really bring the point home.  I think he just got caught up in the whole fucking pun thing that everyone out there  that cares about this story is trying to do.  Chris in Arkansas writes, the guy was either in on it or too dumb to know the difference.  Well, that's from Casino, and he's right.  When De Niro said that about the guy who – the jackpot on his machines had gone off.  You know, the thing is, what you're saying, dude, to me, you're looking at it almost as 
[01:03:30]  irrationally as the politicians who knee-jerk react to everything.  You're saying, oh, it's language.  We got to – you can't be fired for language.  It's like you've got to look at each thing in the context and understand what the person  is doing and saying.  And yes, Jimmy, I completely agree with that.  But I think what gets me, too, is you'll have a guy on TV and he'll slip with the word  fuck.  And then 30 seconds later, the next commercial break, well, we're really sorry that this 
[01:04:00]  offensively – if we offended anybody, I just want everybody to know that it wasn't  intended and we'll never do it again.  But if you listen to games on the sidelines with microphones, you hear guys all the time,  motherfucker, and every other word is flying.  Nobody's apologizing for that.  It's life.  It's what happens.  You're right.  But there's a – again, when you say fuck on the air, I don't think you should be fired.  But if you come back and go, hey, look, I apologize for that.  That was – I don't have any problem with that.  Because, you know, there's a certain amount of – you just can't – you can't say fuck 
[01:04:30]  when you're announcing a basketball game.  No, no, no.  But if you slip because you're human –  Yeah, you say you're sorry, which is human, and that's it.  Yeah, I'm –  I think we're so soft as a people that we're letting this kind of shit bother us.  And unfortunately, sorry doesn't mean shit anymore.  You can't – it's – they expect the sorry and the apology and your job.  It used to not be that way.  Sometimes you just fucking made a mistake, and you owned up to the mistake, and apologized, 
[01:05:00]  and then you were able to move on with your life or your job, and that's not possible in most cases nowadays.  No, not at all.  You can come up with a sincere apology, and there's still enough people out there to say that's not enough.  He needs to get fired.  More to my point, I just put Lynn in the Twitter search, right?  And one of the top tweets right now is – it's, I'm Leslie Chow.  So probably an Asian woman, and that's probably why this is okay.  The impressive part of Jeremy Lynn is he's doing all this with his eyes closed. 
[01:05:30]  That's funny.  But you see what's going on there?  I guess she gets away with it because she's Asian, you know.  Of course.  But everyone – more to my point, everyone is trying to come up with that clever fucking Lynn thing.  Everyone's trying to do it.  And obviously the guy probably should have fucking thought about it a little bit to see how outrageous he was going with his.  He thought he was safe because chicken in the armor is a real term, but he got spanked. 
[01:06:00]  All right, guys.  Hey, Jimmy, I don't say this to many men.  I love you.  Thank you, buddy.  I love you.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys.  See you.  Fuck off, Mark.  Fuck off.  Yeah.  Queer?  Yeah.  Wait, queer for me.  See you the whole fucking time.  Remember the guy who used it 100 times prior?  Yes.  Well, Tim found where he used it 100 times prior.  Oh, good.  Tim in Charlotte.  Tim?  Hey.  Yeah, I did the search.  It looks like the other 99 times were when he was reporting at the Beijing Olympics.  That's funny. 
[01:06:30]  A little worried.  One other thing, if I were ESPN and found out that he did it on purpose, I would give  him a 30-day suspension.  If I found out he did it by accident, I would have fired him.  Yeah, on purpose is a little, it's just a rough one because it's not as ambiguous as  slope or like chink is one that when you say that to somebody, it's just, it's, I don't  put it at the equivalent of nigger, which was used by the, you know, I just think that's  a harsher word and was used for a lot longer. 
[01:07:00]  But as a sports editor for ESPN, if you did that without knowing it, I wouldn't want  you working for him.  Yeah, you're dumb.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  On purpose?  Okay.  You made a mistake.  You made an error in judgment.  You went too far.  30-day suspension.  Right.  But to not see it, please.  Well, we live in this new world.  Everyone gets really panicky.  And, you know, ESPN owned by Disney.  Of course, ESPN was going to fire the guy.  Of course.  Meanwhile, Walt Disney was one of the biggest racists ever.  That's the beauty of it.  That's all they say, right?  Here's the, thank you, sir.  Here's the SNL skit where they just go with the whole Lynn punt thing. 
[01:07:30]  How long is this?  New York sports now, Dan Mardell.  That's our special reporter, Knicks point guard number 17, Jeremy Lynn, and the Lynn  sanity surrounding him.  Now, despite the Knicks loss in New Orleans, the Big Apple is still in the middle of a Jeremy  Lynn-vasion.  Fellas, do you have Lynn sanity?  Hey, you better lock me up. 
[01:08:00]  I mean, I am criminally Lynn sane.  Oh, yeah.  My feelings are Lynn tense.  It's Lynn describable.  I mean, I am literally Lynn love with this Jeremy Lynn.  We all agree we'll never get tired of Lynn puns.  Well, as Charlie Sheen would say, Lynn-in.  That's another thing we never got tired of.  Yeah.  Now, with all the talk swirling around Lynn, some of the discussion has gotten racially 
[01:08:30]  charged.  We've seen derogatory comments from Fox Sports' Jason Whitlock and ESPN.com.  The bottom line is, the kid's a great basketball player, and race has nothing to do with it.  As the New York Post says, he's a-masion.  I mean, he's unstoppable.  He's like that sign said at Wednesday's game, Lynn is the Knicks good fortune.  He's sweet, not sour.  He turned Kobe into Kobe beef. 
[01:09:00]  And Kobe's like, hey, I ordered fried chicken.  Hey, yo, what's up with that, man?  Yeah, and the black guys get mad at him.  Don't say chicken.  Come on, Joe.  Joe, leave race out of this.  Fellas, Jeremy Lynn had some amazing moments this week.  What were some of your favorite Lynn-cidences?  Well, I'd say it was in the fourth quarter against the Lakers.  Lynn goes to the corner, and me love you long time, since a three. 
[01:09:30]  I gotta say, Knicks-Raptors last Tuesday.  Five seconds left, Lynn goes to the top of the key, and wax on, wax off, Mr. Miyagi.  Game-winning shot.  Excellent.  I picked the Knicks-Kings when he, uh, when Lynn passed it to Amare Stoudemire.  Stoudemire was dancing like Maury Povich just told him, you are not the father.  Yo, yo, what's up with that man?  What's up with that man?  He was not dancing.  I was finding the line.  If he was, I bet he was saying, Domo Arigato, Mr. Lynn Bato. 
[01:10:00]  Now, that's funny.  That's funny.  Ah, boy.  Switching gears for a moment.  It's Black History Month.  Let's take a moment to honor a great African-American athlete.  Jackie Robinson, an amazing athlete who broke down barriers.  Robinson endured name-calling and racial taunts, but he persevered.  And that's why today the sports world is tolerant. 
[01:10:30]  New York Sports now could have with Jeremy Lynn, uh, last Tuesday.  Let's take a look.  Yeah, we talked about...  Ha-ha.  It was a great honor to throw the ball today.  The weight was large and the men tall like stones.  Ha-ha.  Soon we battle Dallas and I will try my tiger claw technique.  Go!  Ooh!  Uh.  Oops.  I was gonna switch the audio.  That, uh, that person will be, uh, reprimanded. 
[01:11:00]  You know, I think there's something glaring that we are all overlooking.  I mean, what's gonna happen when Carmelo Anthony comes back?  He likes, uh, Chinese and his MSG.  See what I did there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw that.  Hey, Carmelo's gonna see Lynn in the locker room and be like,  Excuse me, are we playing ping-pong here?  Well, you may not see him at all because my homie Carmelo rolls in late.  Yo, let me tell you one more time. 
[01:11:30]  One more time.  Shh.  Okay.  That's extremely offensive.  Yeah, the notion that an African-American man are late for work is an outdated and ignorant stereotype.  True.  I'm sorry, I thought we were having that kind of fun.  Dan, back me up.  We apologize to our viewers at home for the comments of Joe Dixon.  They were Lynn sensitive and politically Lynn correct.  He has been fired.  Here in turn, we'll talk Jeremy Lynn with comedian Don Rickles and a crotchety World War II veteran. 
[01:12:00]  Live from New York, it's Saturday night!  Good skit, man.  It was great.  It's a good skit.  That was really fun.  And it shows the black guys getting mad.  Right.  They should have hit the black guys a little harder, though.  Oh, that's...  With a couple of racial slurs instead of just behavioral stereotypes.  Yeah, that's the bravest they could get, I guess, right?  They should have went all in.  But more to the point that everyone's just trying to fool around with that whole Asian angle.  And they didn't say chink.  No. 
[01:12:30]  No.  They're not that brave.  Yeah, why didn't they say chink?  Oh, I guess they're...  What?  It was funny, but...  Well, they're not that brave.  It was good.  It's a clever skit.  We would have wrote it differently.  Not much differently, but a little bit...  Like, I like the black guys getting mad.  That's funny.  It shows you how phony people are, but...  Right.  You gotta do a couple of black slurs, not just late for work and...  Chicken.  Yeah.  A chicken reference.  You gotta do something about spook or J the Jigs Up! 
[01:13:00]  Right.  And say chink.  That's what the whole...  Unless this was done before chink.  Was this done before the chink?  Well, Saturday night is on Saturday night.  11.30.  When did this chink one happen?  Saturday, 2.30 a.m.  Oh, so it hadn't happened yet?  I think it happened.  Yeah.  You mean so Friday night into Saturday?  Friday night into Saturday morning.  Oh, okay.  So they had about 10 hours.  So they probably had this...  They had this skit already written, you know, during the week. 
[01:13:30]  Maybe.  When you read Darrell's book, you see, they blow these together quick sometimes.  I know.  I know.  But they could have certainly updated it.  Chose not to.  And they should have said chink.  Chink in the armor, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, chink.  There's a chink in the armor, and then the guy's...  See?  But that's what everyone's trying to do with this Lint thing.  Everyone's out of their minds trying to come up with the best pun possible on Twitter,  you know, on TV, during their sportscast, just walking around the office.  Everyone's just trying to be that clever guy that comes up with the number one, you know,  pun.  And I think that's what, you know, happened to that guy. 
[01:14:00]  I'll say it again.  I caught up in the whole fucking thing and didn't think it would be a problem.  And last week we had Andrew Lincoln.  Can I tell you, I started watching Walking Dead.  It's fucking great.  Well, let's talk about that next.  I'm only a couple episodes in.  I don't know how much to say about it yet, but I will shortly.  I gotta go pee-pees, man.  So there you go.  I think Joe DeRose is coming in today.  He's here.  We have any other guests?  I think that's it.  All right.  I want to talk about...  That's a hell of a guest.  Joe DeRose is a hell of a get, right? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I want to talk about the Whitney Houston funeral a little bit, I guess.  I don't know.  That's a lot of coverage.  I fucking sat in front of my TV for four hours.  I never was at a four-hour funeral.  What the fuck?  I thought I could watch this thing for an hour and then go outside and get some air.  I felt like I couldn't leave the TV.  It would have been disrespectful.  Yeah.  I just wanted to be on top of it.  Four hours, though.  What the fuck?  Kevin Costner.  We'll talk about it next. 
[01:15:00]  Stay there.  Get up if you want to.  It's Grim in the Morning with Greg and Jim.  Yeah, boy!  Bass!  How low can you go?  Death roll?  What a brother know.  Once again, back is the incredible.  I'm animal.  Be uncannible.  Be public enemy number one.  Five-o said freeze!  And I got numb.  Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?  But it's the wax that determined an expert. 
[01:15:30]  Now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell.  Cause a brother like me said, well.  Farrah cause a prophet and I think you want to listen too.  What he can say to you.  What you ought to do is follow for now.  Power the people say.  Make a miracle.  Keep up the lyrical.  Black is back all in.  We're gonna win.  Check it out.  Yeah, yo, come on.  Here we go again.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  With the Sex Man. 
[01:16:00]  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  You stepped on the hook.  Whatever.  I couldn't wait for it.  Sounds exhausting to sing like that.  Doesn't it?  I love Public Enemy, but just imagine being the guy.  It's exhausting.  Imagine them taking over your Halloween show.  Fucking Iraq.  Wow, he's awake now, huh, Sam?  All three of us in the bathroom.  Like, hey, that was a pretty good hour we just had.  And Iraq just goes, yeah.  Iraq still doesn't like. 
[01:16:30]  You don't know how to socialize in the bathroom, do you?  I don't want to socialize in the bathroom.  It's us, though.  We all accept that we got to take leaks at the same time, so we're like, what the hell?  Usually you don't talk when you're in the men's room, but that's the only time we get  to talk off air, so we talk a little.  Yeah.  But you're still old school.  Yeah.  Or just get the good vibes going.  Like, yeah, you did a good job.  Right.  You're going to come back strong.  Right.  You're like, that was a good hour, huh?  And Iraq was like, yeah.  I go, what's up with you?  You still asleep?  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  I go, why?  He goes, oh, a lot going on.  There's always a lot going on with Iraq.  What's going on, Iraq?  I had a lot to do with my house this week.  But it's always vague.  There's two nights of staying up late for watching wrestling, so I think that probably.  It was a wrestling night?  Well, last night and Sunday night was Elimination Chamber, which was very exciting.  What the hell is that?  Stop with that shit.  Elimination Chamber?  You're making everyone mad.  What the fuck is that?  It's the last stop on the road to WrestleMania. 
[01:17:30]  Is it now?  When's WrestleMania?  At the end of March.  See, I could accept WrestleMania, but.  40 days away.  Did you watch Elimination Chamber?  Yes, I did.  Why?  Because it's awesome.  It was.  It stinks.  Who was in it?  Everybody.  Punk is still the champion.  He won.  CM Punk?  I like him.  I'm Team CM Punk because people are asking me between him and Breezy.  Fuck that Team Breezy shit.  Team Breezy?  Chris Brown. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Chris Brown and CM Punk have a little thing going on Twitter.  That's right.  I'm Team CM Punk all the way.  But they literally are naming wrestling shit now after Twilight?  What?  That was the whole thing with Twilight.  Like Team Robert or Team?  No, that's whatever.  That's Chris Brown.  Team Breezy or Chris Brown.  No, but I'm saying, didn't they just take that from Twilight?  Oh, they might have.  How gay is that?  Oh, I don't know.  They might have.  It was the characters in Twilight were...  Who are the main characters, Sam?  No, I don't.  Don't act like you don't fucking know.  It was Edward.  Yeah, Edward.  Edward Cullen. 
[01:18:30]  And I forget the girl's name, but I like the Twilights.  You like the Twilight series?  Not as much as I thought, though.  I don't like the wolf boy.  He annoys me.  Really?  I have no opinion.  Team Jacob.  Yeah, Team Edward and Team Jacob.  The funniest part of Jim saying that was you holding your hands like this and rubbing  them together.  Jimmy admitted that he likes the Twilight movies.  I've never seen them.  I have no opinion on it.  I want to see the Harry Potters, and I want to see Lord of the Rings.  I feel good.  I'm all in with the Harry Potters.  The Harry Potters, except for the first one, are awesome.  Even the first one as a kid movie was pretty cool to watch. 
[01:19:00]  What the hell, man?  It's not terrible.  I've had to watch every kid movie, but I enjoyed it.  It's not terrible.  It's not great.  And they went dark with the whole fucking Harry Potter movies.  The last one was awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah, but why would you ever send your kid there?  There's a very good chance your kid's going to die if you're hanging out anywhere near  Harry Potter.  It's stupid.  Opie, please.  I would pick another school.  People didn't know that the Dark Lord was going to return from the dead.  I mean, you know.  You kind of knew, like, three movies ago that there were some shenanigans going on at  this school.  Maybe you should enroll your kid in this place. 
[01:19:30]  That's a good point.  Why the fuck would you enroll your kid in a place where half the students die, and then  everyone celebrates by the end of the movie?  Wow, did you just ruin Harry Potter?  I think you might have just logically ruined it.  Why did I ruin it?  Because you just put out...  The series is over, and everyone saw the movies.  No, no, no.  I don't mean ruin it like...  I don't mean gave it away, ruined it.  I mean, you just made such a logical point that I think I might never be able to enjoy  the films ever again.  Well, unfortunately, you know, being a parent, you look at things differently, and I say unfortunately  because I kind of liked how I looked at stuff. 
[01:20:00]  But now when you have a little guy running around, you're like, who the fuck would send  their kid to this crazy school where people are dying left and right?  Well, when all that shit was going down, they did close the school.  That was a couple movies ago.  Yeah, Voldemort was their Columbine.  They shut down the school for a little while.  Where were we?  Oh, Public Enemy?  No, I want to know why E-Rock has a lot going on.  It was just wrestling shows?  It was Elimination Chamber plus Raw, and this is the first Raw that's like really ramping  up to WrestleMania. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  And could you explain the CM Punk, Chris Brown thing?  Because I don't even know.  I just know I had to pick a side, and I went with CM Punk.  Well, CM Punk tweeted randomly that he wanted to fight Chris Brown and made a comment about  curb stomping him.  Oh, really?  And then Chris Brown responded saying that CM Punk was on so many steroids that he couldn't  please a woman, and that he would have his assistant send his biggest fan, CM Punk, an  autographed package.  That's the big Twitter beat. 
[01:21:00]  And did CM Punk write back about being on steroids and beating a woman or anything like  that?  I would hope that that would be the response.  Yeah, he didn't respond.  But at this point, if we're going to talk about this whole thing, why not?  Rihanna deserves everything she gets.  You think so?  Yeah.  Chris Brown wished her a happy birthday yesterday, and she tweeted thanks.  Yeah, I saw that.  Got the whole Twitterverse in an uproar.  What the fuck is she going to do?  And now they're both on each other's remixed single.  She's probably scared.  Nah, man. 
[01:21:30]  Thank you.  Nah, man.  They're going to get back.  From a marketing standpoint, it's brilliant, because they're both on each other's song right  now.  So that gets everyone going, what?  I got to download that.  Well, it's classic fucking social justice.  If she doesn't give a fuck, why should we give a fuck?  You know what I mean?  Why is there still any sort of outcry with it if she doesn't care?  That is true.  You know?  So fuck it.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying, guys?  I just rolled in today to make a few points.  Absolutely. 
[01:22:00]  Home run.  Joe fucking DeRosa in the house, playing the Laugh House in Philly.  I said house twice there.  That's never good.  This Friday and Saturday at the Laugh House, Joe DeRosa.  Why the public enemy there, E-Rock?  I used to like public enemy a lot.  Well, Malcolm X was assassinated 47 years ago, and most of their stuff features a lot  of Malcolm X teachings and images in his videos.  So we're celebrating?  Just remembering.  Oh, remembering.  Okay.  Well, I didn't know why. 
[01:22:30]  47 years ago today?  Of course we're not celebrating.  That would get you fired if you said that on a radio show.  That's horrible.  Not really, no.  If you celebrated King getting shot, but Malcolm X is still scary to most white people, so  they wouldn't mind you saying, well, he was a rabble rouser.  Even though I prefer him of the two.  If anybody wants my opinion, I prefer him to Martin Luther King.  Malcolm X had the better movie, without question.  By far the better movie.  Without question.  And by far the better quotes.  Like, yeah, free at last is kind of nice, but by any means necessary, it's probably more 
[01:23:00]  realistic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I would say if I was tough.  But I'm not.  We got the Rihanna, Chris Brown thing.  So Chris Brown verse from Rihanna's birthday remix.  This has got everyone talking.  Of course, not our audience, because we don't give a fuck about this.  But somehow we got on this topic, so we might as well play this.  It's 40 seconds.  We could all handle it.  And it's not even my birthday.  I'm not.  It's a private party.  Girl, I want to fuck you right now. 
[01:23:30]  Been a long time.  I've been missing your body.  Mommy, let me turn the lights down.  When I go down, it's a private party.  It's not even her birthday.  But I want to lick the icing out  Give it to her in the worst way  Can't make the blow of candles out  I won't die  Baby, I like it 
[01:24:00]  It's so exciting  Don't try to hide it  I'ma make it my best  He can sing, god damn it  He can't say he's not a good singer  He is terrific  Wow, you know, marketing-wise  He got us playing it  It's smart as all hell  It's a good song, it's not bad  He didn't bargain with the cake, cake, cake, cake, cake  It's a style  No, it's alright 
[01:24:30]  Did he say, I want to lick your ass and mouth?  No, you're icing off  Cake, cake, cake, cake  I want to lick your ass and mouth  Icing off  At first I thought he said asshole  But then I was like, oh, he's saying icing  Icing  He's certainly talking about pussy there  No  No, he's talking about cake  No, he's talking about cake  I think it's pussy and maybe a little asshole  I don't know why you've got to take everything to a lowbrow place  I think that's what's going on there  I think  What's going on?  Sam knows this one  What's going on with Chris Brown and the gay sex thing? 
[01:25:00]  I don't know anything about the gay sex  I mean, there's been rumors about it  Supposedly someone screen-capped a conversation  Screen-capped his DMs to another guy  Oh, I mean  And no one's really brave enough to go with it  I saw it floating around over the weekend  I don't know how true it is  Did you see it, Sam?  No, but it's right here  What's it say?  Oh, who's got it?  Superficial?  Yeah  Superficial has it 
[01:25:30]  Chris Brown allegedly had gay sex  Wait, what was the headline?  I'm reading it  Gay sex with Martin?  Martin World  Leaked DMs  Allege  DMs on Twitter?  Mm-hmm  Oh  Someone decided to screen-capped this shit  Because they think Martin had his Twitter open or something  Martin World said  Am so above all this, bro  Get real  Delete my number from your contacts  I ain't gay, bro, and bi  Am proud like Fergie 
[01:26:00]  Nikki and Jessie J  You the one hiding  What I do  And with whom  Is my business  And Chris Brown writes  And nigga  I heard about you hooking up  And nigga  I heard about you hooking with Trey, too  You can stay  Stay fucking dat homie  I stay selling out shows  That's  But that's not gay sex  That's him following a guy gay  This is just the beginning of it  Oh, I didn't know there was another page 
[01:26:30]  I'm sorry  I jumped a gun  I jumped a gay gun over here  No, this is just their conversation  They screen-capped the whole thing  And then Chris Brown  I don't know  What was the last one about Fox  I forget  What's the one?  I don't want to  Out of turn there  All right  And then Chris Brown's next one was  Fuck you, Fox News  Good morning, America  And  Whatever  And then  This is what Chris Brown  DM'd  If this is really his 
[01:27:00]  It says  Yeah, we don't know  Because it doesn't say verified next to it  Should it say verified or no?  I would  I don't know  I think maybe it doesn't say it on the DMs  It looks like it's  What?  Might be starting from the bottom up  By the time codes  Oh, okay  Well, thanks  I was reading it backwards  I talk to you the way I want to  To, my nigga  I sell out shows  You still a nobody  Except for writing songs  From major celebs  That's all  Just because we messed around a few times  Don't mean you should respect a nigga  And the shit  Hence 
[01:27:30]  F-A-M-E  Fag  Yeah, I enjoy when you fuck the shit out of me, nigga  But that's only in the moment  Only a stupid nigga would reject an opportunity like that  Do you see  Or DM about it  Do you see Chris Brown  That was a Chris Brown DM, supposedly  We don't know  Do you see him writing that?  Like  That'd be crazy  Man, if somebody hacks your Twitter  Come on  He couldn't be that dumb  Well, you know, dude  My whole thing with this is  Chris Brown's a guy that 
[01:28:00]  Beat the shit  Living shit out of a woman  And showed virtually no remorse for it, right?  And in this culture where people will just put sex tapes out  Or do anything for publicity  Why would a guy be above a publicity stunt like this?  We'll just put it up  Say that I did a gay tweet sex thing  And then we'll say that it was fraudulent  And my account got hacked  It's good for  It's good for attention for a while  You know what I mean?  Maybe, but in that world  In that world  Gay  Gay shit  It would lose some credibility  Yeah, I think in that world  Because he doesn't need that right now 
[01:28:30]  I mean, it might be with another celebrity girl  But I don't think any guy would allow them  Like, say, yeah, you fucked the shit out of me, nigga  It was great  I don't see anybody doing that for publicity  I think that's a stretch, Joe  Jesus, Joe  Chris Brown is just getting his reputation back  How do I  What do I do?  How about this?  I'll get fucked in the ass by this guy who writes songs  That's great  Yeah, you might be a little off of that one, Joe  Yeah  A little bit  You might want to reel it in a bit  Unless he was drunk  I mean, maybe he was drunk 
[01:29:00]  Was he drunk when he hit Rihanna?  They said they had been drinking  I don't know  I don't know either  It was before the Grammys  But let's just say for the sake of argument  Perhaps  This is a big if  But what if he was drunk  And wasn't thinking and wrote this  That I could believe  What if he was?  Maybe  Well, it's not taken off  So people are not brave enough to go with this one  I'm also still not sold  That it's tweet sex  There's a way to interpret this 
[01:29:30]  Where if Chris Brown called  What's his name?  Martin World?  Yeah  A fag  Right?  Or gay  This dude would have came back and went like  I liked it when you fucked me  Only a dumb motherfucker would not take that opportunity  You know what I mean?  He would say shit to fuel on Chris Brown  Keep calling me a faggot  You fucked me  Do you know what I mean?  Like, there's nothing here about like  I want to fuck you in the ass  I want to cum  All Chris Brown stuff is like  You're nobody  I sell out fucking shows  You're a piece of shit 
[01:30:00]  See, I heard you about  You'd have sued Amazon for two million  Your lawyer  So what are you saying?  They didn't really have gay sex, Joe?  I'm saying there's nothing here  I'm confused now  I'm saying there's evidence here  That Chris Brown is calling this guy gay  And accusing this guy of being gay  And the guy said he's bi  And he's proud of it  Yeah, exactly  But everything this guy says in response  To me could be interpreted as  A guy being insulted  And trying to insult him back  In the best way he can  Chris Brown never says anything 
[01:30:30]  About fucking this guy  He says it about being fucked by him, though  The guy says it, though  No, Chris Brown said it  No, no, where?  Chris Brown right there  Yeah, I enjoy when you  Fuck the shit out of me, nigga  But that's only in the moment  Only a stupid nigga  Would reject an opportunity  I thought that was the other guy  Sorry  Chris Brown saw an opportunity  To get fucked in the ass  And he went for it  Okay  I'm way off of this whole thing  I'm trying to  Alright, never mind  Yeah, I don't see any rap  Like, mix-up vernacular  Where you fuck the shit out of me, nigga  Can mean something else  Right  I thought the other guy said it 
[01:31:00]  Alright, well  Sorry  I didn't see it  But I don't believe  When the guy is going  Yeah, and you delete this shit  Well, I just wanted to move on  From whatever relationship  You had with the guy  I don't know  They had a little beef  Maybe some gay sex  I don't know  I have no idea  Let me just answer the question  One more time  Honestly  I know I got shot down  The first time  Do you really think  These guys aren't  Street level  Fucking hip-hop scene  They are in the  Britney Spears machine  Right now  Do you really think 
[01:31:30]  It's beyond them  To be talked into  Doing a publicity stunt  Like this  Yes  Really  Because he's  Chris Brown  Is a sex symbol  He's a sex symbol  For women  I don't think  Anything  They wouldn't do anything  To fuck with the fact  That he's now  At the Grammys  He's back  His reputation's okay  The last thing  He's going to do  Is allow them  To Twitter  You fucked me  Real good nigga  Because that will  Follow you for the  Rest of your life  If it's true  But getting on  Rihanna's song  You know  That goes more  To your point  To get a publicity  Thing going 
[01:32:00]  Because if your  Account got hacked  Maybe they hate  Each other  But their people  Got together  And said look  Fucking you know  Throw a little  Something down  We're going to  Add it to her song  It's going to be  Good for you  And good for her  I wouldn't put it  Past him  Well it's obvious  Why he would do that  I'm a little surprised  Why she would do that  I mean that's  I mean Jesus Christ  I guess maybe  It's some Christian  I'll forgive you shit  That's money  I mean they're both  So big  Speaking of the gay  You got a jazz  I didn't hear this yet  But the guys  Are saying it's hilarious  There's a jazz FM radio station 
[01:32:30]  In the UK  And they aired four minutes  Of gay porn audio  Over a jazz song  I've been in radio  A long time  I know how this happened  You got a board op  Right  You got to assume  Some kind of board op  It was a pre-taped show  So you got a board op  His whole job  Is just to sit there  And wait to hit commercials  Right  So of course  You're going to  Make some phone calls  You might tweet  You might see  What's on the internet  And this guy  I would assume 
[01:33:00]  Decided he was going to  Watch some porn  Some gay porn  Some of that gay porn  And he so happened  To have some kind of pot  That was potted up  And had no idea  Because he probably  Turned down the audio  Or something  Yeah he probably thought  It was in like  Cue  Program or cue  Or whatever it is  Yeah  And thought he could  Just hear it in the studio  Because he was listening  To his gay porn  And not realizing  And he's got to listen  To the song  To make sure  You know  That he knows  When the song's either over  Or the program's over  So he kind of  Had to have both on  But he assumed  That the gay porn part  Was not being broadcasted 
[01:33:30]  If that makes sense  To everybody  All right  But no  It was broadcasted  And we got it  So listen to this  Maybe not listen to this  Let's see here  Come on  Perfect kind of jazz  You already know  This is going to be  This is going to be  This is going to be  This is going to be  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, oh. 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:38:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  what you do to raise money oh that's when he realized 
[01:38:30]  and you know that he probably just turned it off and like looked at the equipment oh my god oh my  god no the phone's not ringing no it didn't go out it didn't go out i'm not fired the tenant  didn't happen no one's taping it's late this is great yeah it's great so what so what the guy from 
[01:39:00]  the station say i want to hear from your mouth again highly he apologizes for the highly regrettable  incident is that the guy steve quirk no i mean it was the funky sensation mike viddy oh what a fat  creep he looks like yeah bob kelly wait mike viddy was in charge of the radio station that day or  was it his show both but what do you mean both like he's like the program director and this  happened during his shift oh boy that's what the daily mail said really is he fired yet no what do 
[01:39:30]  you mean no no they do things differently over there i guess he's in charge it was a pre-recorded  saturday night show they're emphasizing right so he was in studio that day yeah listeners so he was  saturday night's funky sensation program or stunned that's such a great it kind of went  together those two songs in a weird way do you think somebody put it over his audio huh like a  hacker like a hacker no do you think someone put it over the audio you got something on this travis 
[01:40:00]  that is classic yeah this is my favorite audio in a long time uh from what i understand his show  is pre-recorded so so it was his show but it's just somebody running you know the tape of it yeah  mike viddy wasn't in studio the board op was probably watching porn yeah because he was bored  he already said that mike viddy didn't want to take credit for the fact that he was watching gay  porn while his funky sensation show his funky sensation show was on the air pre-recorded  yeah whoever was running the radio station that night was bored out of their minds and decided 
[01:40:30]  you know this is a perfect opportunity to watch gay porn and he said that he worked up he plans to  apologize again next week who mike viddy because it was already pre-recorded because it was his show  yeah well so the thing is that you think that they were just watching on the computer they didn't  realize that the computer i think so absolutely it's it's like i'm amazed at how fucking careless  people are it's like if you want to crank off the gay porn at work just bring your laptop in  yeah like why would you risk what are your phone but you just assume don't do it on the computer 
[01:41:00]  that's routed through the board yeah that's what i'm saying it's like right now city we we talked  about this a bit but uh but i just hit one button we can listen to that but it won't wouldn't go  over the radio you know what i mean he he thought he had it all figured out he probably in double  check triple checks you would have to because if it's something like gay porn you better be really  sure he was so sure that it wasn't on the air that it continued he just assumed that he assumed that  he could hear both audio sources but only the listeners could hear the the song he was probably  double and triple checking and didn't realize that the third time he checked he just left the 
[01:41:30]  button on he's done that a million times that's all he's done it so many times he probably just took a  look that's all good he didn't think it's all good i'm gonna watch my gay porn while the  fucking listeners listen to this horrible jazz song screen cap can you grab that audio i know  yeah did you hear what you said yes i said screen cap can you catch that audio thank you no but  what did i say i don't know what are you doing you watching gay porn there what are you what's going 
[01:42:00]  on with you today he's cranking he's thinking about seamist winning the elimination chamber  elimination what are you doing that you missed opus we're down we're down anthony all this week so i  need you to step up what are you doing you're falling asleep in there i was looking up other  things what are you looking up you were looking up what are you looking up quickly what are you  looking up looking up email checking his email he's the greatest i love the honesty of eric he's the  greatest email he was in space in the bathroom yeah he's just searching for pictures of 
[01:42:30]  the undertaker forgive him the undertaker made his comeback well did he oh yeah 50 was able to  do anything except one chokehold in the entire match he hasn't wrestled in a year so that remains  to why why was he out of year he hasn't wrestled since last wrestlemania but why was he hurt no he's  just not he wouldn't take work a regular schedule he's got to be mid 50s right he's probably someone  in the room said 50 he's got to be way over 50 at this point probably early 50s that's it young  when he started but he shaved his head oh why he hasn't taken his hood off yet oh that's good 
[01:43:00]  it's not him it's him we did when the music started did they all go it's the undertaker do  the lights go out fans of the undertaker how does he control the lights like that it's confusing  it's terrible why are you shitting on what's the matter it's just terrible yeah yeah come the  undertaker really has he i love why hasn't he been arrested yes exactly killing all these people  and he's allowed to go from city to city he's a serial killer he doesn't kill anyone i'm a big 
[01:43:30]  wrestling i like wrestling a lot and i think it's awesome still i never used to i never realized  till today how every title of the event sounds like a gay porno movie elimination chamber sounds  like a gangbang movie did you see raw summer slam royal rumble yeah everything working wow that's  very good what about wrestlemania though that one yeah well yeah kind of wrestling around a little bit 
[01:44:00]  naked yeah a little rock what were you doing this weekend a lot of work on the house like what  work on the house frankly the floorboards see how vague you because there's a lot that goes on with  a house so like it's vagary well what were you doing name this detail name three things you did  this weekend for the house right now exactly moved in furniture removed furniture took the banisters  off the stairs to check carpeting and move furniture out of the base that's what that's two things  that's one move furniture twice right picture of seamus in every room he likes his wrestling he loves 
[01:44:30]  seamus and why'd you have to do you like seamus i just met seamus yeah who's seamus exactly he's  the great white that's what eric does when he says he's associated with this show  what did you have to check the carpet for on the steps because we're getting new runners on uh  all three sets of stairs okay what are runners they cover the carpet they cover plastic right 
[01:45:00]  why are you giving runners it's carpet that covers the wood on the stairs oh sorry okay all right  because the cat keeps falling down the stairs  your cat's stupidly slipping why is the cat slipping the wood is the cat blind no the wood is  is very well done but the the cat can't get any traction on the on the stairs so the when she  tries to run down too fast she just trips and then goes falling right down why haven't you taken  video of this yet yeah man because i'm not i'm never there when it happens you could when i'll 
[01:45:30]  be downstairs in another room and then you hear when the cat that would be a youtube sensation let's  get this done you could put the nintendo cartoon that says you rock video yeah what was that nintendo  guitar i don't remember that i see it very good work with it so is the cat does the cat ever hurt  itself no she just gets startled and then runs back up the stairs even better for uh a youtube video  let's do this oh he really has his own production oh no i forgot it's so bad though you've seen this 
[01:46:00]  four times  it's a terrible video  it's awesome  this is my  e-rock out of his videos  would you be mad if i e-rock video  would you be mad if i threw my open orange juice at that  no computer monitor  no i'm mad that you didn't  freshly squeezed  where the fuck we get that from i don't know i ordered apple juice but i got a freshly squeezed orange 
[01:46:30]  juice not a bad surprise there  that's nice  you know show biz sometimes treats you all right  that's nice  that is the fucking faggiest  it's horrendous  fucking thing i've ever seen in my life  that's horrendous  it looks awesome  so gay porn guy uh fired  it looks like  yeah  oh yeah  well it's in the uk maybe they handle things differently over there  maybe they realize that maybe the guy just made a mistake  he's all worked up  he was all just 
[01:47:00]  lathered up  i love the point that was made that  that he was totally caught off guard with that  commercial spot  because you don't hear a sweeper  you don't hear anything  no  one thing down and then one thing  yeah  there was supposed to be something  oh yeah  something  the name of the show  something  what station you're listening to  not just some guy  you know he was coming right at that moment  or maybe he realized  because the commercial fades up  maybe he thought  wait  the internet pot is down 
[01:47:30]  and he went  holy fuck  the internet pot wasn't down the whole time  you know what i mean  he mixed up the two uh  right  it's the same feelings  he had the same  when you said he just stared  he had the same feeling in his stomach  as like when  i used to wait tables  and like  you realize you forgot to put somebody's order in  and they're like  you know what i mean  like ten minutes after they were supposed to have it  they're like  shrimp scampi  try to blame the kitchen or something  oh fuck  we're a little slow tonight  yeah 
[01:48:00]  you gotta yell some stupid number code  in the kitchen  shrimp scampi  76  that fucking scampi  whatever  what does that mean  like move it fast  i don't know  there's some fucking code for it  i can't remember  yeah there's all these like number codes in a kitchen  where you yell  you know  when they go 86 the fucking mozzarella  you know when they're out of mozzarella  so the code is help me out here  there's like a number code  save my ass  yeah for like i fucked up  please  just do this immediately  you know  maybe it's on the fly  i don't fucking know 
[01:48:30]  i got nothing to back up my  um  my claim i just said it  not only was this a highly regrettable incident  but uh it's also described as  an unfortunate erring  unfortunate  it's an unfortunate erring  wow they're being polite  they're british  that's some polite shit right there  it's an unfortunate erring  that while you were trying to enjoy jazz  we played two men fucking each other in the ass  well  to the beat of the jazz song by the way  he was getting a good deep dicking 
[01:49:00]  that was no that was no tentative helmet in the ass  that was a legs back deep dicking  that was a good one  guy's all in with his gay porn i guess  he sure is  he couldn't wait to  to get his gay porn on  he doesn't like a lot of chatter  he doesn't like a lot of story in his porn  he doesn't like the storyline at all  let's get right to the action  if we're gonna do this  let's do it  i just can't believe again  like that he's that he's doing it on the fucking computer  routed into the  it's just like jesus christ  you got to be fucking retarded  this is how all these guys 
[01:49:30]  this is the  but it's easy it's set up nice  it's set up nice  we could look  our computer's right here  boom  but it's clearly not  if it went out over the air  that's my point  he thought it was in queue  it's  but it's like why would you  here go  hit that  ah see  maybe i just fucked up  see i couldn't even figure it out  these guys  every time something like this happens  it's like these guys are serial killers  like they want to get caught almost  so they do it in a very dangerous way  just bring your laptop in  and fucking cream the screen 
[01:50:00]  i wondered if he had family that knows that that's his shift  you know  there's problems on so many levels with that guy  because you can't just say  ah i got fired they they downsized  right you know  no it's going to be on the news at six o'clock  board happing for mike viddy tonight  the funky sensation  were you the one who was playing the men fucking each other while the jazz was  mom  no i bet i bet my mom  oh mom we all knew what was happening  mike viddy doesn't tell his friends that he pre-tapes his bad show  because he wants them to think it's live 
[01:50:30]  so now people think it was mike viddy himself  they don't think mike viddy was jerking off the top  oh no  he was fucking fat guinea  and people don't understand the radio business in general  so yeah most people just assume that mike viddy was watching the skateboard  so mike viddy is pissed off  gives a new meaning to his show funky sensation by the way  funky sensation  what an appropriate name  so mike viddy's got his mind pissed off  are you the one who was  make sure you get his apology  because he is going to make sure everyone understands that he had nothing to do with the gay porn 
[01:51:00]  i just thought  well when you first said jazz  i thought it was going to be like that  doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom  which was old school  would have been really funny to hear a guy getting fucking ass mashed  the ass fuck he'll be preferable to the jazz i think  yeah  so do you think that like uh  the guys who brought up's parents were like  did you hear what happened at your station  a man was playing the audio of the man fucking each other in the buttocks  and he had to go  hey mom i heard that 
[01:51:30]  i quit tonight  you weren't  why did you quit  i won't work for a station that has that  i won't be a part of it mom  i quit suddenly  who was it that did that  i don't know mom  some new guy that fired him too  but i quit  filthy poofters  i don't need to be when poofters are getting played  why would you quit  oh i just had to you mom  let's not talk about it  don't tell anyone to quit  jesus  oh that's so funny 
[01:52:00]  oh mike viddy's gonna be explaining everything  when is he back on  um  his regular shift is saturdays the funky sensation  and this just went down two days ago  yeah apparently  yeah yeah yeah  oh i can't wait for saturday's explanation  i can't wait for the next  the next edition of funky sensation  with mike viddy  mike viddy  can we get a copy of that  it's gonna be a hit  oh my god  so you think the guy went home to his mom  and was trying to cover up the whole fucking thing  yeah either that or he had to play it off 
[01:52:30]  she's like  they were playing audio  with one man having sex with another one in his bum  i didn't hear that really  i quit earlier in the night though  so i probably was gone by the time that one happened  i was out with my girlfriend  i didn't know you had a girlfriend  yeah you've been dating for a while  suzy may  we went out  me and my girlfriend  i quit  quit that job  it was disgusting  they were really going fast and hard  were they really mom i didn't hear that

[01:59:00]  sticks appeared on tv during a time when no black people were allowed on happy days and he made quite an impact  acting as fonzie's best friend for two full episodes  sticks proved to the world  that some white people were good-hearted  and open-minded enough to have black friends  it's really nice to meet you ralph mouth  hey potsy weaver here sticks how you doing  listen sticks we gotta get together sometime play some basketball  basketball  yeah well you guys are supposed to be really  no man i don't play basketball my hands get too slick from eating all that fried chicken

[02:00:00]  it's all good i'm gonna watch my gay porn while the fucking listeners listen to this horrible jazz song  hey joe i want to talk to you for a second  what's up it's no secret chicks dig rich guys  now  like yourself  what are you talking about  you do well because you're rich right  oop i hate to say i'm rolling in it 
[02:00:30]  but i'm swimming in it  you're swimming in it  you know what i mean  let's face it  the best way to get in a girl's pants is if she thinks you have cash  it's true  i'll often throw a wad of money in a girl's face at the beginning of a date  and it helps you  yeah oh yeah  you make it rain  i know  it's more like i make the cash hit her in the face  you make it drizzle a little bit  yeah  sure you could try to bs your way at the bar but that's gonna get you nowhere  that's why you need estmen.com 
[02:01:00]  unlike sugar daddy sites which are filled with rich old farts  estmen is filled with regular guys who know how to play the game  at estmen  are we talking to guys or girls here  uh...  i don't even know  everyone  what do you mean everyone  everyone  who are we talking to  the women  that listen to us  i think it's for the guys right  i think it's for the guys  it's for the guys  you're saying you gotta play the game  so what the guys go to the website and make believe they're rich  are

[02:04:00]  man if you're established successful or talented  so now what happens  so now you're on the dating website but you have enough money that in one picture you could look like you might be rich  and then you take the girl out on a nice date  but you don't take her back to your shitty apartment  so she thinks you might be rich  then you don't get to have sex with her  yeah  you have sex with her in a car or in her place or something  because that's what rich guys do  what kind of millionaire fucks in the back of a buick  i know exactly  rent a nice car 
[02:04:30]  rent a nice car  this is not one of those eccentric billionaires  i could only come in an alley  as soon as i realized i could get a nice apartment together i wasn't finding fucking parking lots to park in there sam  i don't get this  it's for a wild fling  what  so now  there's cheaters  by the way if you don't have money to be a regular rich guy you don't have money for a wild fucking fling either  you gotta save up enough money to be a rich guy for one night  i don't understand 
[02:05:00]  i want to understand our clients  what did i just sell  did i do a good job for these people  no because you  i'm guessing no  i don't wanna  i don't wanna feel like these guys got ripped off by this company or myself  they did  because you decided to question everything  and now you've  deconstructed their product  well just explain what the fucking thing is  i can't do that  maybe they should rewrite the copy  i don't know what i wrote  i don't know what i just read  it is confusing  it's not your fault  i don't think it's your fault  i'm on your side  we can't ruin one library  but we  we gain a client for life here 
[02:05:30]  maybe they get back together and they work this shit out  there you go  look at the bright side  so you're supposed to be a slob that goes to the site and you look rich all of a sudden  i don't even know anymore  i'm being honest  tell me what this is about  well i'm not on the website  there  yeah i mean that seems to be what it is  all right go to estmen.com and i guess figure it out  jesus  that's a good tagline  no it's not  that's a great tagline  figure it out  go there and figure it out yourself  because obviously we can't tell the people 
[02:06:00]  go to est  go to estmen.com  beats me  right  go to the website because you might get banged  is that what's happening here  so you might be able to fuck a chick  can i see the copy  yeah  see now jimmy's involved  i will figure this out  i'll figure it out for you  all right  it'll look like you might have some cash  it says basically  it's no secret  excuse me  chicks dig rich guys  okay we get that  let's face it  the best way to get in a girl's pants  is she thinks you have some cash  that's true and honest  it really is the best way 
[02:06:30]  to get in a girl's pants  if she thinks you've got money  and you've got something going on  sure you can try to BS your way at the bar  but that's going to get you nowhere  true because she'll see your lousy clothes  she'll see the cheap drinks you're doing  and you're just smell your Drakkar Noir cologne  so so far i'm with this  that's why you  estmen.com  unlike sugar daddy sites  which i have been on  jim norton is saying that  i have been on them  and they don't work  it's all spam  it's all  spam  on the sugar daddy site that i was on  it's stunk 
[02:07:00]  and it was not one that we promote on the show  unlike sugar daddy sites  which are filled with rich old farts  estmen is filled with regular guys  who know how to play the game  at estmen  you don't need to be famous  or have a six-figure salary  as long as you have the confidence of someone who does  you don't need to be living in a penthouse  you just need enough cash  to show the woman a hot night out  it's very self-explanatory  sound too good to be true  it's not  with three girls for every guy  the problem is  there's not enough rich guys out there  so if you can play the part 
[02:07:30]  there's no better place than estmen.com  what do you have to lose  sign up for your free trial  what that's saying is  but the women are going to know you're not rich  because you're the same guy in the bar that was trying to get something done  i think this is basically for guys who have something decent going on  but don't live a rich lifestyle  because it's not saying that you should lie about being rich  it's saying you don't have to be rich or have a six-figure  as long as you have the confidence of someone who does  so if you're a confident guy  and you have something going on  you can succeed on this site 
[02:08:00]  because it's not saying  totally pretend you're someone else  because then logic says  when you get home  what if you're a rich guy with low self-esteem  where does he go  can't be on the site  sugar daddy's site is probably a rich guy with low self-esteem  because he lets the money do the talking for  so basically this site is for guys that know they don't have a lot of money  but they have confidence  yeah and they can show you a good night out  and they have a decent amount of money  maybe a guy that makes 40, 50 grand  who can't afford to take a woman out  but are the women assuming that these guys really are rich  and then they're going to be pissed off 
[02:08:30]  no I don't think so  I think they'll go  and this is a guy who has a decent income  who has the confidence of a rich guy  got his shit together  got his shit together  fuck Jimmy just saved the client  but I think that's what it was  we just saved one Sam  because they're saying that if you go on a sugar daddy's site  you're only going to be  there's only a bunch of rich guys over there  you can't compete with that  here it's just other guys kind of probably in your decent financial range  but you're not competing with a guy who makes six million a year  gotcha  because that you know  anyone who's going to fuck a guy for six million a year 
[02:09:00]  doesn't care how much you have going on  they're going to fuck the guy for six million a year  that's why I asked Sam  now we know the answer  and everyone is happy now  thank god  see  if you feel like getting up  then go ahead  if you don't  what do you want from me  it's grim in the morning 
[02:09:30]  with Greg and Jim  hang with Joe DeRosa  Jim Norton  and  that's about it I guess  I was explaining  win sanity to Joe DeRosa  yeah I'm not a  I don't know sports  but this is how big this story is  that someone like you that  doesn't know sports  you know a little bit about it  you know what I'm saying  it's on everyone's radar  yeah I know  I'm trying to explain the turnover thing  to Joe DeRosa 
[02:10:00]  in my opinion  a lot of people looking at the turnovers  that Jeremy Lin has so far  but the way he plays  he's going to turn over the ball  a lot  I mean nine ten a game is bad obviously  but you're going to accept the fact  that he's going to turn over the ball  a bunch of times  because he is aggressive  and always trying to  you know push the action  and drive toward the hoop and stuff  but given that technique  or whatever you call it  right  yeah that style of game  would a you know 
[02:10:30]  a fair number of turnovers  be considered per game  because I know his average  is still high  I think you would accept  four a game  four and he's at about six a game  yeah well he had that one game  where he had  I forget now  nine or ten  nine was it  nine  yeah  that's a lot no matter how  you play obviously  but he's aggressive  he's going to turn over the ball  a few times a game  but I think you accept that  all right  all right  my opinion  which means nothing  because we're not a sports talk station 
[02:11:00]  so no one's going to pick up my quote  and go with it  nothing  but  it means nothing  it's all right though  you're allowed to have an opinion  it's my dumb opinion  it's not dumb  all right  don't talk about yourself like that  Whitney Houston is buried  and um  Joe had a problem with the  the helicopter showing the hearse  driving around  yeah look  I know that when somebody like this dies  the  you know funeral itself  is made a production out of  by the people that are orchestrating the funeral  but  when when you see a helicopter 
[02:11:30]  covering the hearse on the freeway in LA  or wherever it was  like it was OJ's fucking white bronco  mm-hmm  you're just like Jesus Christ man  like can you  is there any  well why did they have to have  consideration for the  the dead person's privacy  the privacy of the family  anything you know  it's just kind of gross  why do they have to have the camera there  what camera there  at the funeral  it was televised  it was it was a four-hour show  on CNN  that's what I'm saying  then you know what  maybe I don't know what I'm speaking to  if I'm speaking to the public  or whatever  I understand 
[02:12:00]  I like that shit by the way  I like that voyeur shit  so when I heard there was gonna be a camera  I was like  yeah I gotta watch this  it's fucking creepy  that there's  it's weird that the family wouldn't want  or need that  it's one thing to televise the funeral  and go look  she was she was a worldwide international celebrity  and you know her fans want to pay their respects in their own way through their TV set and watch the celebration of her life  I get that  when you start following the hearse with a camera like it's somebody fleeing like it's cops or something like that 
[02:12:30]  then it's like okay so why don't you just bring the camera into the coroner's thing and we'll watch the autopsy  and you know it starts to get morbid at that point to me  yeah  you know why don't you just put a camera on the dead body for the 24 hours that it's sitting on ice or whatever  we're probably heading that way  we definitely are  we're probably heading that way eventually  that's exactly what will go down  without question  I don't think  I just have no interest in it  and it's not because I think I'm above it  I just don't give a shit  like  I guess for fans it's one thing 
[02:13:00]  if you're a hardcore fan  like Ozzy died  I would want to watch the funeral and the wake and stuff  excuse me  because to me that would be an event  but Whitney  I don't care about  there is a morbid voyeurism to it  but the way they act like it's this gigantic  helicopters following the hearse  the hearse is just a statement of how desperate we are for news  like  she's dead  what do you need to see the hearse making a left  right  it's not Kennedy's limo  I don't understand the attraction to that  that doesn't help the  it's just for a bunch of commentators to say things that we already know 
[02:13:30]  to keep you watching her body be moved  it's fucking morbid  yeah  it's insane  that's not a fan  maybe there's a fan  I don't know  I just I have no interest  I just don't  I don't even know if I would  that's an interesting  I would absolutely  interesting reference  you're saying with Kennedy  because I think  event like the Kennedy assassination  the tape right  I think events like that  are what build up to something like this  because  there's this sick fascination where they go  well we only have that much of the Kennedy tape 
[02:14:00]  we only see this one little clip where he gets shot  we can't get close enough to see what happened  we're not in there whatever  and then that slowly grow into  we're going to cover every fucking aspect of this  in any way that we can whenever we can  you know  you don't want to miss the moment  like Leary had a joke  Dennis a joke about when Oswald got shot on live TV  he just never moved from the TV again  because you know  right  didn't want to miss anything  yeah  that had a couple of the most  that was the most amazing moment ever caught on live TV  I think is Oswald being executed by Ruby 
[02:14:30]  right  so I mean watching that  didn't they catch Robert Kennedy too?  getting assassinated on tape?  yeah I think the camera just missed him though  you're right though  that's a big one too  but Oswald  yeah  that was on live TV  I think you know what it was  holy shit  you caught the shot  but I don't know if you actually saw him getting hit  because the first shot I remember  is you see Kennedy laid out on the floor  and we're going to go on to California  or whatever he said  and then I guess the camera didn't think to follow him walking awake  now you'd have 50 angles on it  oh fuck yeah 
[02:15:00]  you got to remember  well most of us weren't alive  but when Oswald got shot on live TV  that was like holy  we're used to seeing weird shit now  as a society  because of all the channels  and the internet  and what have you  but can you imagine back then  you're just watching TV  and you watch a guy get killed on live TV  yeah it's insane dude  he's been shot  he's been shot  he's been shot  he's been shot  he's been shot  hey Oswald has been shot  now from another camera the motion is slowed 
[02:15:30]  the murderer moves in  and here is the shame of all America  as Jack Rubinstein takes the law unto himself  the dying Oswald is rushed to the same hospital where President Kennedy died  doctors work to save his life  but 48 hours and 7 minutes after the president's death  his accused slayer is dead  wow  amazing amazing story 
[02:16:00]  you know that's the report of what happened  but I mean that I wonder if they've ever shown the actual you know live live audio live video  excuse me  oh I'm sure they have  I'm babbling over here  that's after the fact  they looked at it again  yeah  but it went down live live  oh yeah  right  well and that's to  seeing that speaks to where the culture was then mentally 
[02:16:30]  and where the culture is now mentally  it's like even after that happened  what year was that  1969  63  Jesus Christ  alright  most people would never ask that question  not a history buff  yeah but that's one of like five  oh whatever  five years you should know  come on please  63  right  what celebrities died in that time period  I mean there were musicians that died back then  right  I mean  Martin  well I don't know 
[02:17:00]  you mean musicians like that  but like a celebrity  politicians took priority  well what I'm saying is like you know  Christ  Sam Cooke or whoever died in the 60s right  so whatever celebrity musician actor whatever died  and actor whatever died back then  Marilyn Monroe  right  it wasn't like after the Jack Ruby incident  we put a camera on those people for the entire duration of the funeral and go  we need to get every fucking inch of this  which back then there was still respect that was  what I'm trying to say and I'm rambling  I understand your point  like what started this new trend 
[02:17:30]  is basically what you're trying to say  video maybe  maybe the ease with moving video cameras  right  don't forget they didn't have  it was really a lot harder to film stuff in the 60s  than it is now  the convenience wasn't there  but I mean the trend of  where it's totally okay to have a camera  at Whitney Houston's funeral  what was the one incident that started that recently  well I think Jim  I mean because Michael Jackson  that wake or funeral was live as well  I think it was  was there one before that 
[02:18:00]  was it Michael Jackson that started this  where now we're going to put the camera right in  inside the church  no it was OJ  it was the OJ  the OJ trial is what started  dude do you remember  that ramped us all up to this point  this is so funny  I know this date  it was June 1995  do you remember sitting at home  and watching them trail his Bronco  down the Los Angeles freeway  and you were just like  I've never  I can't believe I'm watching this right now  while the Knicks were playing  yeah it was like insane dude  they never had anything like that 
[02:18:30]  and then they had this  this morbid gruesome  fucking murder trial  that was 94 wasn't it  94  no it was 95  the murder was 94  was it 90  the trial was 95 though right  when was the Bronco chase  94  it had to be 94  20 years ago  yeah well either way  it was  all of a sudden  you were let in  and you got to see this whole thing  and you're watching people talk about  their family members get decapitated  or whatever  you know what I mean  and I think that's what started it 
[02:19:00]  that's when it really  we were building up to it  and then it broke  and I think you have a great point too  with the video thing  because video is cheap  and it's easy  and light  yeah  when did cable  come in  cable came in  78  but when did like  all the cable channels  where you had HLN  and you had Fox News  when did all of them  start competing  for viewers  like when did it become  24 hours of news  CNN  ok CNN  so that's what started it  that's what started it  was this need to fill the time 
[02:19:30]  I think you've said that  the need to fill the time  with stories  plus it was a bunch of things  coming together  the information being passed  videotapes  the need for news  well because when you had  a half hour newscast  and that was all you got  you know you didn't have time  for all the nonsense  because you had Vietnam  you had real stories  you had real stories  the Russians  the news still does real stories  but they have all this other  time to fill  so now they're going  with this sensationalism  whose bit is  who's got that bit  I probably do  it was me  where they say  watch it be a hacky awful  I know 
[02:20:00]  it's really funny  they go  when I was a kid  the news took a half hour  and that was it  the news came on  it was a half hour  and they go  and that was  that was just about right  like it wasn't 24 hours  and they go  half hour news show  they still had to have  a horse shit story  at the end  about like a squirrel  doing something funny  or whatever  yeah  who the fuck spit is that  probably Jimmy Tingle  the comic of that ilk  political guy  I think Elvis' death  was televised  and that's what started  Oscar says 
[02:20:30]  that was a big death though  just like Michael Jackson's  was  someone saying  Princess Diana's funeral  yeah that was a big one too  and so was the wedding  the wedding was a big one  but I'm talking about  specifically  excuse me  funerals and wakes  JFK's funeral  when we started televising  JFK's was a massive funeral  did we televise the whole thing  yeah when John John saluted  well I know that  we have that footage  yeah I guess you're right  but we're also  were we inside the church  I don't know  because I'm sure  we've done stuff  leading up to the church  but I'm talking about 
[02:21:00]  going now  inside the church  but this is the thing too  I'm  Princess Diana  and  uh  uh  Kennedy  and whatever  you're talking about  crucial  instrumental  social  sociopolitical figures  in history  you're not talking about  Whitney Houston's hearse  do you know what I mean  there's a difference there to me  where you go  the president has died  we need to show the nation  his funeral  but at the same time 
[02:21:30]  we're not gonna videotape  or film  right  the fucking hearse  turning the corner  and going down here  man they showed  they showed the crash site  of Princess Diana  and there's actually  footage of her dying  that no one's really brave enough  to push out there  Dr. Steve shows up  every once in a while  here and there a little bit  but Dr. Steve said  the hostage situation  started a lot of this  nightline  24 hour news cycle  etc  nightline  I forgot about that one  I'm talking specifically  about going in the church  now for funerals and weeks  that's all 
[02:22:00]  I'm starting to think  maybe Princess Diana  was one of the first ones  wait but was  was Diana  before OJ though  did she die  it was like  right around the same time  Diane was  Diane was after  after yes  so I say OJ started this  plus as time goes on  it gets easier to get cameras in  because they're not as invasive  or as obvious  yeah we got a couple things going on  when did all this ramp up  where we're really getting personal  and also the other question is  when did we start  broadcasting actual wakes  and funerals of famous people 
[02:22:30]  inside the church  where you're hearing eulogies  and songs  and you know  Michael Jackson  I mean they obviously did it  with Diana too  I don't know  see here's the  here's my argument  is they very  they definitely did it  with Diana  they definitely did it  with Kennedy  but to what extent did they do it  Diane  Princess Diane  Diana was the whole fucking thing  but did they  if you remember  it was the whole fucking thing  but was it like the Whitney Houston funeral  fuck yeah man 
[02:23:00]  okay all right  that's what I'm saying  but before that  I don't have one that comes before  Princess Diana  we were inside the church  I'm all  all I'm asking is  when did we start going inside the church  well they did it for presidents  didn't they  every time they  a president died  or a world leader  they had it in the  that national church down in DC  maybe  but did they go in the church  the John John salute  that Jim's talking about  yeah that was like  I'm talking inside the church  you didn't hear  you didn't  we weren't inside the church  for JFK's funeral 
[02:23:30]  I don't know  I'm almost positive  you might be right  I just don't  I don't think they were  now  all I'm saying is  now when these celebrities die  it's gonna be  you know normal  to just throw it on TV now  well Reagan too  we had Michael Jackson  we had Whitney Houston  you know  we're gonna start seeing this  more and more now  well we're seeing everything  so we're more comfortable  seeing everything  it's like  and I guess we just expect now  to see everything  absolutely  absolutely  and that's kind of what I was trying to say earlier  is like it speaks to the mentality of culture  it's like with this 
[02:24:00]  with you know  for lack of a better term  this Twitter generation  it's like there's no privacy  there's no wall between  anybody and anybody else anymore  no matter how famous you are  no matter how exclusive you are  no matter how rich or whatever  it's everything needs to be televised  and it gets to a point where it's just kind of gross  it's like  I don't  I'm not gonna lie  I love it  I love the voyeurism of it  yeah  I have no problem with it  but don't you feel like  it's almost like  seeing porn 24 hours a day  it takes away 
[02:24:30]  there's no mystery anymore  it takes away everything  I don't need to wonder  what a funeral looks like  but  people's lack of ability  to reveal themselves  is what makes me hate this  I don't hate  people's what  lack of ability  lack of willingness  to reveal themselves  I don't mind Whitney Houston's  awake being televised  but I just wish that when it happens  in the same breath  the same people that are watching that  don't cry like fucking babies  when your privacy is  that's what  like people cry like  what about privacy in the airports  right  don't cry about it 
[02:25:00]  when you're all sitting  in front of the television  watching this fucking hearse  go down the street  you don't respect privacy  so don't expect it  okay  if you don't respect privacy  you cannot expect it  I like it  they're saying  Pope  Pope funerals too  we've been televised for a long time  Pope funerals are big  well remember when Reagan died  and there was like  they televised the tour  of his coffin  yeah that was recent though  I'm talking  I'm trying to figure out  when it really started  I think  televising the funerals  in the wake  I think you did with Diana 
[02:25:30]  I really think that's the first  you see the princess Diana  popes before that I'm sure  but the popes were always  on a different level I think  they were on a different level  and it wasn't sensational  it wasn't sensational  when a pope died  it was sensational  when Diana died  like you think  when a pope dies  you understand  he's the head of the Catholic Church  it's a major  it's a world event  right  and they've always been televised  a lot of people are saying  for as long as most people  could remember  yeah and the difference between that  and the Diana thing to me  is obviously she's a major world leader 
[02:26:00]  right or was  right  but like the point is is that  they didn't  they didn't follow the pope's car  down the street  you know to the hospital  as he was being rushed in  to fucking be put on the table  to pass away or whatever  it's like but they  had the footage of Diana's car  racing down the freeway  because the paparazzi  was trailing her  they had the crash  they had the body being pulled out  all that shit  I also think it's it's  when the pope  or when it's a president's funeral  there's a quiet  there's a quiet respect 
[02:26:30]  and there's nothing to be learned  it feels like when it's a celebrity  like Whitney or somebody  they're looking for more to sensationalize  like they're looking for  oh and Bobby Brown is coming  oh will there be trouble  it will  were the the drugs  the factor  for some reason  when it's a president or a pope  the facts are out there  and there's a certain dignity  they handle with  yep  like here's here's the car  approaching the church  it's not a sensationalized feeling  and it's not a free for all 
[02:27:00]  it's just a moment in history  yeah  I mean I'm not trying to disagree guys  ha ha ha  alright  what do you think of Bobby Brown leaving Whitney's  now we're discussing it  he shows up with nine people  they're like look man  it's you plus two  what are you doing  and then he got mad and left  who  he brought a whole entourage  to his ex-wife's fucking funeral  making it about himself  and then he leaves  he leaves  he leaves  he wasn't supposed to be there  no I guess they finally gave him like a plus  you know him and one or two people 
[02:27:30]  two people  but then he decided to come with nine  and when all nine couldn't get in  to a church that supposedly held 350 I think  and they had like 1200 people in there  he said fuck this and he left  maybe by himself  well his statement was  I was there with my two children  we were asked to move our seats  right  three times  he goes I felt disrespected  so I gave my respects to my wife  and I left  ex  ex-wife and I left  but I mean that's exactly what we're talking about too  the fact that that was a fucking 
[02:28:00]  literally a headline  the next day  it's just gross  when it's a president or whatever  like you said  it's  like you know  the hearse is approaching the church  a very sad day in American history  right  there's a reverence there  with this  yeah it's  get what you can  info wise  grab the info before the next people do  it just feels like a competition  people are bringing up John  people are bringing up John Lennon  we weren't inside the church for his wake or funeral  I'm just  there was always like  where we went right up to the doors of the church 
[02:28:30]  and now we're inside  that's that's all I'm asking today  when did that start  so  yeah I don't know  I don't know  I think it's a bunch of stuff dude  I don't think it's  I don't know if it's one event  or if it's just the merging  of the slowly  the technology is coming  the news channels  the obsession with celebrity  the information  it's like 10 different things coming to a head  so you could look at OJ  but then you go  oh but you know what Diana's  oh yeah but there's a million of them  you can look at  and someone is saying  one of the Kennedy funerals was televised 
[02:29:00]  so that would have been Robert  um  maybe yeah  I just don't know  top 10  oh let's see that's a good one Sam  what is this  oh  top 10 what  top 10 touching moments  from nationally televised funeral  for Whitney Houston  let me  read some of these  top 10 moments  uh  Dionne Warwick  reads a poem  from Whitney Houston  from her  from  yeah  okay  Kevin Costner recalls  the bodyguard 
[02:29:30]  what year was that  bodyguard  probably  91  that's good  that's the last time  he had contact  with her  did he  did he talk about fucking  no way out  yeah  I love how they have to go  way back in time  to go look  we were really close  and we had a special  relationship  he quickly tried to kill  somebody that produced  Waterworld  right  what else  Clive Davis pays tribute  to his loyal friend  yeah  uh 
[02:30:00]  I will always love you  as pallbearers carried  Whitney Houston's body  down the island out of the church  as much as uh  I'm a fucking prick  that was like  that was pretty uh  who sang it her  yeah because uh  Aretha Franklin was supposed to  but she was either sick  I don't know what the fuck  happened to her  so when they were  you know taking the  coffin out of the church  they played  Whitney's singing  I will always love you  it was a fucking moment  to be honest with you  alright yeah  I don't like showing my  sensitive side  but I was like holy fuck  that's a fucking moment  they're lifting up the coffin  and carrying it out of the church 
[02:30:30]  as she's  belting out  Tyler Perry recalls  Whitney's grace  now did Tyler do it as himself  or as Medea  Medea  ok  I'll tell you what happened  with the Tyler Perry  everyone's like holy fuck  this guy could preach  he was pretty impressive  I'm getting real again here  but the guy  you'd think you'd just be  a dummy up there  and he preached better  than most  you know the pastor himself  I think  now are they friends? 
[02:31:00]  yeah but he's like  no one really knew  that we were friends  for the last four years  because we kept it  kind of you know low key  think he was fucking her?  I don't know  we're just friends  it's a little weird  why would you want the world  to know you're a friend?  did Ray J talk?  no  so Ray J didn't talk  the boyfriend  the ex-husband didn't talk  the kids talk?  no  Ray J just fucking Whitney Houston?  yeah  dating her  I know I just found that  after she fucking died  ok  I never knew what was going on  with them  oh yeah  and then they love pulling at  the heart strings 
[02:31:30]  like a few people said you know  had a conversation with Whitney  and she was ready to go back  into rehab but she just  needed to get past the Grammys  and she was gonna go  she was so close to going back  into rehab  oh shut the fuck out of here  if she wasn't  yeah but the people that  have to go with that  it's like shut up  that's just another excuse  why you're not going  into rehab immediately  god  these stupid reporters  you know the sad part  of the story  is she was  she was ready to go back  she was gonna go back  right after the Grammys  but what?  the last fucking  drunken fling  at the Beverly Hills Hotel 
[02:32:00]  I'll tell you what  I just learned that  B.B. Winans is a man  oh yeah  I never heard of B.B.  I thought that was a girl  B.B. and Cece  I thought it was two sisters  I don't know  the B.B's and the Cece's  yeah and the A.A.s  it's an emotional eulogy  I guess  Alicia Keys breaks down  yeah I guess  was she singing or talking  yeah she sang something  what'd she sing  some song  no one is a good song  huh  and no one  no one  oh yeah  she's good man 
[02:32:30]  I got her on my iPod  she can sing  going to the church  was one of the top moments  of the Whitney Houston  yeah  why  a preacher from New Hope Baptist Church  Baptist Church  opened the funeral by stating  we welcome you to our home  and we're going to have church today  Whitney you are the only one  that could bring us all together  today is your day  we celebrate you  we come together  for this family  that was emotional  oh yeah  alright  the most  can I just say one thing 
[02:33:00]  the most shameful  thing to me  tied into this whole funeral  extravaganza  fucking whatever  was that like literally  two hours after she died  not two hours  a few hours after she died  the party  there was the  no there was the announcement  from the producer  the Grammys that  that Nicki Minaj  and whoever was going to be  doing the tribute  it's like Jesus  fucking Christ guys  Nicki Minaj  Jennifer Hudson  Jennifer Hudson  whatever  whatever  one of the blacks  no but you know 
[02:33:30]  she was  but I was just like  Jesus Christ  can you just keep that  are you really trying  to boost ratings right now  it's just sick man  it's fucking disgusting  they're marketing  the Tonight Show  had a weird vibe to it  because all those guys  in Jay's band  they were they knew her  from the beginning  like they I think they  were her tour band  like way back  so they were fucking  really depressed  yeah the one  the one  the one  I was one of the guys  gave a tribute  to her before we went  like Jay did half a monologue  right 
[02:34:00]  and then just let the guy  talk about Whitney Houston  oh really  they were legitimately  how do you feel about  Clive Owen continuing  with his party  you know it's a hard thing  to just cancel 800 people  but it turns out  her body was still  in the room upstairs  as they're partying  in the ballroom  I don't think she was going  to Clive Owen's party  she was  Clive Davis  I said it again  I said it again  I didn't catch it either  fuck  Clive Owen is a young  good looking actor  I've been making this mistake  for a week  I don't have any problem  with that  Clive Davis 
[02:34:30]  why shouldn't they have a party?  to detectives  as they're trying  to go upstairs  in the coroner's office  that's just a weird vibe  but did everybody  know she was dead  or was it like  he found out  and was like shit  let me go deal with this  everyone knew she was dead  Clive Davis had his party  going on  and her body was still  upstairs in the tub  I actually  or out of the tub  by that point  I was out there  when it happened  and I was within  a couple miles  guy marrying himself  to the story  and I would have stayed there  at that hotel  why didn't you? 
[02:35:00]  I would have stayed there before  but you were thinking about it?  no  but I mean it could have happened  but in your head  you're thinking  well maybe  things were a little different  if the hotel I was at  had burned down  and someone at that hotel  had cancelled  they might have said  you can stay there  I could have been right there  and talked to her  we all do that  every single one of us  does that  had you been a guy  that did drugs  you could have  intercepted the drugs  that she did  or had I been a bathtub maker  I could have made her deathbed  we don't marry ourselves to it 
[02:35:30]  she's dead  what's the last two moments?  the top ten moments?  Alicia Keys  or anything?  Stevie Wonder reveals  his crush on Whitney Houston  he can see?  what do you mean he revealed  it?  it's been hoaxed the whole time  yeah exactly  I've been lying to you motherfuckers  I just didn't want you  white devils to know  I could see you  what do you mean revealing  a crush?  what are you talking about?  actually in my little fantasy world  I had a little crush  on Whitney okay?  well give the shit  shut up  I didn't know what she looked like  but I knew that she was probably  high all the time 
[02:36:00]  and I could fuck her  and she wouldn't remember  what do you think she looks like  in his head?  well she's green  yeah exactly  it's funny  bigger tits  exactly  the number ten moment is  R. Kelly performs  I look to you  alright  okay  alright  we're gonna go to break  I don't mind  I have an announcement to make  oh I forgot Jimmy  that's right  big announcement  besides the Thursday through Saturday  at Fort Lauderdale  this coming weekend  the one hour special I talked about  is indeed being taped 
[02:36:30]  at the Ohio Theater  at Playhouse Square  in Cleveland  that's the one I wanted  it's the theater I wanted  two shows  are going to be on sale  it's going to be  Saturday April 28th  and the two shows  I have to confirm the show times  but tickets go on sale  this Friday  they're not that expensive  the only reason I'm selling tickets  and not  just doing it for free  is because I'm doing this one  with a production company  and there are theater expenses 
[02:37:00]  so I'm going to make  very little money from this  this is more going to be  to cover  you have expenses to pay  when you're performing  they try to cover your costs  it's basically it  there's going to be a very small profit  on this  it's not going to be a big profit night  this Friday  pre-sale is this Thursday  the details will be here soon  two shows in the Ohio Theater  it's a beautiful theater  in Cleveland  nice  I don't think enough stuff  is done in Cleveland  and I love Cleveland  and I love that market for us  and I really really  originally Boston was my idea  but there was a technical issue  and then I'm like 
[02:37:30]  I haven't been in Cleveland  in two fucking years  that's where I want to do it  nice  so I'm happy it worked out  I'll give you details as we're coming  I think we're going to bring  the show up there too  yeah we're going to do something  hopefully Friday afternoon  we'll be doing something live  that'd be cool  we've never done  except for the traveling virus  we've never done a live Cleveland event  I'm trying to remember  I don't think so  have we?  I don't think so  no we did do a lot  we went to the radio station once  that's right  oh yeah we've done a couple of those  you're right  the radio station that was in the mall  right right  remember how weird that was?  yep  yeah that was a good time actually 
[02:38:00]  alright  hey uh  going to break  got Chris Cornell doing  I Will Always Love You  I thought this was pretty fucking cool  he ended one of his shows recently with this  nice  guy could sing anything  it's unbelievable  and Joe DeRose is at the Laugh House in Philly  Friday and Saturday  Saturday  yeah  Laugh House is spelled L-A-F-F  I'm at the University of Delaware tonight too  if anybody's around  in Delaware  what do you mean if anyone's around?  yeah if you feel like enrolling in college  really quickly  that's probably mostly students right?  I guess so 
[02:38:30]  I hope so  you don't care if tickets are sold?  I do care  it didn't sound it with that plug  well I didn't want to sound like a plug hog  you know you've been  people expect it  you've been plugging the lamp  just plug  okay  Delaware in the scrounge  tonight  in the what?  830 in the scrounge  whatever that is  I did that years ago I think  that's a lounge  it's a good gig  what's the scrounge  the scrounge  part of the scrounge  it's part lounge  part something  scrotum  part scrotum  part lounge  scrotum 
[02:39:00]  the scrotum lounge  the scrounge  Sirius XM  and now  the Opie and Anthony show  we might have lost Joe DeRosa for the rest of the show  I think he's dealing with credit card fraud right now  I hope not  that stinks  because they're saying my balance is at $100  I'm like what?  I thought it was going to be a quick call he's been on the phone for like 20 minutes  well my balance is $100 is bank stuff 
[02:39:30]  $100 credit maybe then  available?  yeah $100 available which means whatever his credit line is they spend all that and he's like I didn't spend that  I had recently I had one with my bank in I was out in LA and I was trying to make a purchase and they said well you don't have enough credit in your account  I'm like what do you mean I called them  right  and they said you only have an $8,000 credit line  I'm like what do you why?  right  what the fuck is wrong with you?  and they jumped it up on the phone 
[02:40:00]  I mean I was I was again I was an indignant customer  sure  like we talked about with Bill Burr that day I was like that's unacceptable  right  my payments are always made on time  you know a customer of my length you know of my if you phrase things smartly  and they gave it to me  really?  but yeah my credit limit was $8,000  what happened you good?  no I'm fucked  I'm fucked  how do you fuck?  what happened?  credit card fraud?  I'm fucked I don't know what happened  this is what I can tell you what happened actually as I was talking to them I started to figure it out  um 
[02:40:30]  I you know because of always being on the road and whatever  uh I pay my shit like way ahead of time  yeah  a lot of time like when I get money I just start paying out my shit  because I'm like I have money I just want to fucking take care of what I got to take care of  what are you paying for?  I just pay I pay like the minimums way ahead of time  and I always pay over the minimums because I just want to if I have cash  yeah  let me get ready  you want to knock it down  yeah  as much as you can  so I always do that I've been doing that for the last couple years  and this month I traveled so much in January I got off my fucking 
[02:41:00]  I just got off my payment schedule  and I didn't realize I owed something so a couple of my cards I went like a week late on  I was like oh fuck and then I went in and immediately paid them and paid them over what I owed  I just I took care of it immediately  American Express immediately got a call  I get I mean they don't know that this is what triggered it I'm theorizing on this is what happened  they immediately got a call from some fucking cocksucking piece of shit credit union 
[02:41:30]  and they were like yeah your credit score just fucking doubled in the bad way  because you're delinquent and I go I'm not delinquent I go I pay all my shit early all the fucking time  and as I'm talking to them I go wait a minute I was a couple days late on some accounts because I travel  whatever but I that's the first time it's ever happened  right  and they were like yeah sorry we knocked your we cut your credit line in half  you now have like a hundred dollars available credit instead of  because you're if your credit had been 20 you had spent uh 9,900 
[02:42:00]  but now they knocked off 10 so it's only 10,000 so now you have a hundred dollars left  like that's everything yeah yeah exactly so now my credits are there  I can fix it but here's what sucks is  I'm potentially moving out of my apartment in a month or two  and it's like this is the last fucking thing I need right now  is bad credit  because that's the first thing I'm gonna do is check my credit  and it's like I just can't fucking believe this man this is the  I'm gonna start catastrophizing now 
[02:42:30]  but this is the kind of shit where I go I can't live in this fucking country anymore  one slip up like this and it's like sets off this chain reaction  but it's all fixable I know you're panicking and you're annoyed but it is  I had one where I was buying an apartment it was a big mortgage  and it was like a phone bill where I had moved and they never sent the bill  so then all of a sudden you're delinquent on your phone bill which is a big one for some reason  right and it hurts your credit and like well we showed you didn't pay a phone bill  but when you're talking to the people giving you the loan or doing the business 
[02:43:00]  you're still they're looking at a credit score but you're still on the phone with somebody  and if you say look at my history and then this is what happened I was away for a month  and blah blah blah happened if your history is good up until then it's fixable  it's fixable it's not as catastrophic as you feel it is right now trust me  no I've had it happen it's not  or it might be  yeah it could be  or it might be  or it might be the first thing  I'm scared  when you're losing your mind  how many credit cards do you own?  I have two  two charge cards to stores 
[02:43:30]  and then I have three credit cards  can you pay any of them off in full and just dump  like I pay everything off in full at the end of the month  if you can do that you do it  I'm literally thinking about going home today and going fuck savings  here's these cards are done  boom boom boom boom  because you're paying what I do with a credit card is like say you spend eight grand  but it's on your bills and a lot  you pay them eight grand  they've loaned you money for nothing  you know how they hate that  but when you're giving them 30% interest you're paying minimum payments 
[02:44:00]  you're just giving them interest  it's like you're just paying interest on shit that you don't  if you take your savings  pay off your credit card  maybe that's a terrible idea  but why would you keep giving them extra money  it's a vig  yeah I think I'm just gonna go home and fucking  and just pay off at least three of them  you know  like my two of my charge card  one of my charge cards is zero balance  one of them's got a very low amount  so I feel like if I just threw some money at this problem right now  and then just kept one card open or something 
[02:44:30]  it would be like okay you're good  or keep them open  do you use any of the credit cards for miles for an airline?  yeah  yeah that's what you gotta do  fuck the store cards  that's the one that I have the problem with  so  Jesus  so it sucks  it sucks they don't give you one  one fuck up and they fuck you  no they're  it's it's I'm so fucking pissed  that I call the cocksucking credit agency  whatever it is  and they're like  do you have your reference number  and I'm hitting zero because I don't have it  and the automated system goes 
[02:45:00]  this system will not allow you to speak with a representative  until you type in the reference number  so you either request your credit report or hang up  so then I call back American Express  I'm like what the fuck I need this number  because I can't  well we don't have it  I go well you guys took this report from them  you listen to them  you took their advice  you fucked me  without calling me and asking me what was going on  and you can't even give me the right reference number  to figure out what's going on  so now she's like well you can request it  they'll mail it to you 
[02:45:30]  it's like oh so in six to eight weeks or whatever it is  it's usually a week  it's always mail  when there's a pin code product  it's always through the mail  it's annoying  it's antiquated  but they're so paranoid  about getting ripped off  but once you can  you can call them back  you can usually get what you want from them  if you're reasonable  just don't yell  but Bert was on one time we talked about this  don't yell  you're the righteous indignant customer  you've been wronged  you're a good customer  and if you don't yell  and you don't curse  they can't hang up on you  they don't seem to care when I have a problem 
[02:46:00]  I'll even go look at that screen right now  and see how much money I have with you guys  I'm taking it all out  they're like I'm sorry sir  but there's nothing we can do  I've done that  I pulled money in the Bank of America  they don't  and I put it into another bank  you know who cares if you go down to the bank  the bank manager will help you  but they have to deal with these  I had my last mortgage payment  when I wrapped up my mortgage  they fucked up  and they didn't apply my final payment  because I was paying interest  and principal  take it, take it, get rid of it  my final payment 
[02:46:30]  they put in escrow by mistake  instead of paying  so then it showed that I still owed money  and I'm like no I don't  and the automated system was shit  so I went down to Bank of America  I talked to the guy  and he got on the phone with me  and we were on hold on the audit  and he goes yeah I'm a bank manager  he has to deal with that automated system too  but with him being there  it helped  it helped  but thank God it helped  because the guy who had done my payment  in person was there  and he was able to talk to the automated people too 
[02:47:00]  but it's very difficult to deal with  I know I'm contradicting myself  but it's possible  it's just disheartening  because now I'm in my head  this is when I came in today  Opie was like what's wrong  you know you look down or something  well I care so  and I was  thank you  you looked very  you looked very sad  and you got heavy eyelids  did you sleep last night?  no I didn't sleep at all  the upper lids are heavy  yeah they're heavy  are you a cheapskate though? 
[02:47:30]  I forget you are  you are right?  I'm not a cheapskate  if I have money  I'll be generous with it  but I'm very conservative  and responsible with my money  so I don't fuck around  I really pride myself  on paying my shit on time  and like not getting up to my neck in debt  because when I started doing comedy  in Philly when I started out  and I said  I'm gonna move to New York  and try to be a pro  I stopped paying  I had all this credit card debt  and I just stopped paying it  I was like 
[02:48:00]  I'm not doing this anymore  so  and then I got to the point  where I was like  four years into my career  and I started getting letters  like we're gonna take you to court  and I had to like  pay all the debt off  and figure it out  and then after I did that  so that fucked up your credit  that fucked me up bad for a while  and then I bounced back  and I was like  you know what?  I'm not gonna do that again  I'm gonna be really responsible  but is that in your history?  oh I'm sure it's got to be  well then they probably  aren't gonna take a chance  that's why they react so harshly  because you have a history  yeah they're not gonna put up  with your shit anymore Joe  yeah you've been proven  to be a guy who gives malarkey 
[02:48:30]  and excuses  no shit  and so they're like  we have to threaten him with court  yeah now it all makes sense  I thought it was one lousy thing  and they gotcha  no no  they're looking at your past behavior  you're a good customer since Tuesday  yeah right  you gotta be a good customer  for the last five years  yeah right now I'm like  the guy that got out of prison  going you know  I'm the cook in heat  let's go and just give me a chance  it's fixable  you'll be alright  we're running out of show  and for some reason  these guys want me to open this up  on the air  why?  is that anthrax in it? 
[02:49:00]  yeah  it's funny  it's from a fan?  yeah  yeah a fan sent in a picture  so why can't we just do this off air?  this happens from time to time  because it's strange  he sent other stuff  oh no  there's a lot of stuff in here  there's checks  exactly  are they real checks?  yeah  read the letter  oh Christ  Opie Anthony and  oh it's for all of us  that's right  oh you made it sound like  it was for me  which made it even creepier  maybe the sex bagel did  I didn't  oh okay

[02:53:00]  before he can even sign it back  here's his check  uh oh  what are you doing?  are you just gonna mail the check back?  no  you can't  void it  there's a good guy  aw man  look what I do Joe  I turn this shit right over  are you gonna really deposit that?  yes  why?  why not?  why would you deposit that?  photograph his check 
[02:53:30]  you can just go to check cashing place  in case he  that way he can't see your  oh right  stuff  just go to check cashing  they'll take out a little bit  but still it's free money  can I have that picture just so I can sign it?  sure  why would you void out the check?  huh?  because Jimmy's a nice guy  I don't get that  it's a nice picture  that looks like a nice day  it was a beautiful  sunny out  should void the photo too  that's funny  nah I can't fuck with people's uh  look at how the carry took  mhm  and uh  I was skinnier then  that's gonna change 
[02:54:00]  yeah we all were  that's the point  that's gonna change  look at me in the background  look at the difference  yeah in the blue shirt  three pounds  he was fat then too  yeah exactly  no  where's he rocked?  he rocked no  what's his faggot's name?  um  can I have a silver sharpie please  so I can do this right?  his name is Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  his name is Bobby  can I see what this guy's saying  about how he paid twice  in something?  who is that?  well now we're 
[02:54:30]  now we're helping you out  well I just was curious  what he had to say  which one?  I got calls because I paid twice  in the same month  but skipped  uh it's Blake  you talk to Blake  okay Blake hi  hey boys how you doing?  why are you signing in black there Jimmy?  uh so I'm getting a silver  but uh  I don't know  I ask for silver  nobody comes Joe  whose sleeves are too short  go ahead  they're pushed up  okay  the uh  Blake what did  what happened to you?  you get what happened?  I'm just 
[02:55:00]  I wanted to know  okay okay Joe get this shit then  I got a one of those  care credit cards  for uh  medical expenses  and all that bullshit  uh huh  anyway I had a minimum payment due  in December  I paid it on the 18th  I got a check from my  insurance company  later in the month  uh from a flex spending account  some bullshit we have to work  so I went ahead and I paid $500  towards my balance  when no payment was due  so I disregarded the January payment  didn't rethink twice about it  these dudes are calling my house 
[02:55:30]  fucking five times a day  all hours of the day  I finally picked it up  it's some call center in India  India  I got some fucking phone jab  that says his name is Sean  telling me  oh it doesn't matter sure  if you make a thousand dollar payment  it doesn't excuse you from your minimum payment  tick tick tick tick tick tick tick  and I'm just like what the fuck man  so I end up telling him  hey whatever  I'm gonna get a lawyer  this bullshit  well yeah  that bugs me  cause I've always paid like  fucking quadruple  the fucking minimum payment  every month  to keep a good 
[02:56:00]  a healthy credit  you know  score in check  or whatever  I knew if I paid the minimum  that was shit  and I knew if I paid it all off  that was bad  but you need to maintain debt  to gain credit  so I would do that  and it pisses me the fuck off  that every one of these cocksuckers  as soon as I was a few days late  on one payment  they're like  no fucking hang them out to dry  but that's because  of your past history  yes  and it's also insurance too  you pay your insurance  every time on time  the one time you're late  you go to the hospital  they go  fuck you 
[02:56:30]  it's a gamble  it sucks  yeah it's terrible  so  is it gonna help me to go home  to have the marker  is it gonna help me to go home  and throw a lot of money  at these cards  or no  I don't think it'll hurt  to make some payments  you should knock down  I think you should  I always pay into principle  every time  because  if you pay the minimum payment  it's just interest  right  they want you to pay the minimum payment  right  all of a sudden you've spent that  I mean you understand what they're doing  so  I try to pay them off completely  and in full 
[02:57:00]  every month  when you can do that  right  do it  if you have the means to do that  and I'm lucky I'm able to most times  but then once in a while  I'll miss one  and they charge you know  I get hit with a fucking  I'm gonna go home  I'm gonna pay off  a chart  I'm gonna pay off two of these cards  and I'm gonna close the cards  do you invest any money?  no  I don't have money to invest  I invest small amounts  because at least you're getting something  as opposed to zero interest  in a checking account  oh the fucking banks  don't pay you nothing now  they're terrible  I called back in America  and told me you're disgusting  thank you  I took eight million dollars out 
[02:57:30]  and I don't have eight million dollars  or anything close to a million dollars  but I took it out  I have eight hundred dollars in my account  and I said eight million  Sam  let the record state  I'm a good guy today  what does that say Joe?  I'm a good guy today  says uh  pay to the order of Opie  you fucker  don't make me tweet this shit  yeah void  you signed the back of the check  that doesn't make you a good guy  I wrote void like Lil Jimmy Norton  and signed it  and I signed it  I'm a good guy today  yeah  mark this day 
[02:58:00]  yeah  this is what I want from Bobby though  he obviously took this picture  this is all I ask from Bobby  if he's listening  I want this fucking picture  I like it a lot  I hope he looks fucking good in that man  he looks really good  we all look good  we look happy  you look really good  we're on top of the radio world here man  this is before the shit hit the fan  we were in hell  we were fucking doing that dog shit  on K-Rock first  the walk over was like  oh thank god  I'm away from that fucking dump  and god  I miss the big numbers  oh dude 
[02:58:30]  you know what  I miss talking to a lot of people  because it was such an emasculated  unfun version  I miss it  from the old days  where radio is fun  I don't miss  one  thing about K-Rock  I don't miss the bigger  more people  I don't miss any of that shit  I uh  fuck em  let the record show that E-Rock  was fat  four years ago  I know right  he's in the background  and don't let him fool you  he was fat  and is  I love how he makes believe  he's only been fat for a few years  is this the picture right here  yeah  he's the one in the powder blue shirt 
[02:59:00]  in the background  alright so Bobby  and is  Bobby doesn't have to email it  he just got it off Google Images  huh  is that what he did  yeah  well he got a great copy of  no he this is a really good copy  look how big it is  huh  yeah so he just took it off it  he just printed it off Google Images  he saw the picture that he probably thought you looked hottest in  and he was right  and Kenny with this awful shirt  oh Jesus  look at that Sopranos  it's fucking beautiful  it's like look at that  the chest is muscular  and look at how the hand goes down  and it just kind of hangs by the stomach drawing your eyes to that delicious V  these guys 
[02:59:30]  what's the matter  they  they  they put me in a bad spot  why  you got a nice cock and balls in that picture  fuck yeah man  dude  look at that  you can see the head pointing down  I know  when I look at that picture I want to put your testicles in my mouth and go  and even when you're not looking at that picture  yeah  Jimmy loves telling the world that I used to have a V  he still does  I don't have a V  you do  well yeah  you got a half a W baby  then the listeners meet me and go  what the fuck happened to you  I'm like  I never had it  exactly you got an O now 
[03:00:00]  exactly  I never had a V  what's a V?  you know where you have the fucking  down to the fucking cock  yeah  it's a V that goes right down the clock  like the trail  can Bobby send me a copy of this  because I'm too lazy to print it up myself  and I want that picture  I like it  I'll send you a copy right now  you want Bobby to send you a copy?  it's on Google Images  I want a fucking physical copy  I'm not going to go print it  so download it and print it  I don't want to  that's the point  wait wait wait  tell Bobby to send another one  why don't you just copy that one? 
[03:00:30]  you should get a digital copy  I don't  alright I want that  yeah  and then just get it printed  no  I want Bobby  cause I didn't cash his check  to go to his expense  yeah cause I didn't cash his check  you're not a nice guy  I didn't cash his check  I didn't cash his check  why don't you just send one of your minions to do it  yeah  we have interns  I'd make them do Sheila God all day  cause it'll never happen  everyone will forget  no they won't  not if you send them right now  hey E-Rock the boss has an assignment  I just called him Fat E-Rock's not going to help me  they see how good you look in that picture  I don't look exactly 
[03:01:00]  they're going to go print that shit up  masturbation fodder for all of us  I hope you don't mind a little cum on that picture  exactly  you gotta get that picture's going to be glossy  when you get it back  oh we gotta get  Ant's gotta sign it when he comes back  and dumb Kenny  clubby  oh he wants clubby too?  no  get Kenny  Kenny's not in the actual picture  yeah but Kenny's not worth it  the guy photoshopped him  not photoshopped  cropped  cropped him out  oh did he?  yeah  he doesn't want Kenny  he doesn't want Kenny in his picture  that's true  just the celebrities  the actual picture has Kenny in it 
[03:01:30]  but not Bobby's version  Bobby said fuck Kenny  I'm cropping his shit out  yeah cause he knows he can't afford me  you think so?  yeah  are you signing Bobby by the way?  no I signed it too Bobby  I was joking  who Bobby?  it was for Billy  oh fuck him  here Sam  Sammykins  catch the paper  you like that song?  I've been thinking that for years  and I've never had a chance to use it  it's good  when's Mike Vitti gonna explain to the world how radio works?  I can't wait  Saturday night  Saturday night? 
[03:02:00]  Mike Vitti  well Saturday night UK time  UK time  and hey the guy who does the feed is here  what feed?  what feed?  what feed?  online feed  stupid Mars  first I get a thing in my ear saying  the guy who does the online feed is here  and he'll talk  and then Mars comes in here and says  the guy's too scared to talk  alright so  that's fine cause  you know what are we gonna do?  well  before the plugs I got something  I got this  by and large though  it is simply a lovely winter's day tomorrow  bucket loads of cunt  of sunshine across central and east today  bucket loads of cum? 
[03:02:30]  he did say that  he must have been looking at this picture of Opie  no he said bucket loads of cunt  I thought he said cum  I thought he said cum  maybe  maybe I'm looking at that picture of Opie  Jesus Sam  by and large though  it is simply a lovely winter's day tomorrow  bucket loads of cunt  of sunshine across central  why would he say cunt?  why would he?  I don't know  why would someone play gay porn over jazz mum?  I've got no idea  it just happens  that happens by accident  he literally 
[03:03:00]  there's a guy with a computer  in the next building mum  sometimes he interferes  that wasn't going out live from our boy  that was coming in from  wi-fi  ever since wi-fi mum  you're not a pofter are you?  no mum  I've got a girlfriend  she's in Manchester  you're just tuning in  listen to the replay  Jamie had a brilliant take on  the Mike Vitti situation  that makes sense later  yeah sure will  Joe DeRosa 
[03:03:30]  Laugh Factory  Laugh House  Laugh House  Fuck  University of Delaware  tonight  at 830 in the scrounge  and Laugh House  on South Street  in Philadelphia  Friday and Saturday  two shows each night  please come out  here put this back  he's going to be happy  that I crumpled up his note  so now that's worth something  to him I think  and I have  where are you going to be?  Laugh House?  yes Joe will be in Philadelphia  University of Delaware  tonight  Friday and Saturday  I will be at the Laugh House  in Philadelphia  alright 
[03:04:00]  Thursday through Saturday  I will be in the Hard Rock  in Fort Lauderdale  that's this Thursday  through Saturday  and Saturday  April 28th  I shoot my one hour special  at the Ohio Theatre  in Cleveland  Playhouse Square  two shows  I believe  730 and 10  tickets go on sale  this Friday  pre-sale is Thursday  it's being presented  by the station out there  that Rover's on  I forget the name  the call letters  but they're a big station  both shows  obviously will sell out  because this is 
[03:04:30]  the same size  of the House of Blues  which I always sell out  and that's with  camera kills  as we call it  because all the tickets  can't be sold  and the only reason  I'm selling tickets  and not doing it for free  is because this is not  being done by HBO  this is being done for  Epics and Comedy Central  two different networks  but I'm going to own it  so I'm producing it  and I have expenses to pay  so the money you're paying  for tickets  which I think  25 bucks  it's not an expensive ticket  goes for that  very good  and we're all going to 
[03:05:00]  go broadcast live  on that Friday afternoon  I was just talking to Gary  about that he said  they're already making  arrangements for it  so we will be doing it  it's just about time  we did something else  in Cleveland  home of the fat pussy  they got fat ones up there  everyone's got a fat pussy  every girl  it's like you have to  they ask you  when you're on the fucking  Pennsylvania border  twat  if it's fat  you get let in  fat pussy heaven  whoa  take me home tonight  yeah  whoa  come on  what

[03:06:00]  I'll hopefully have health insurance  and be living like a fucking grown up  but until then  you don't have insurance  nope  get it  I can't  you gotta dude  what's the secret Jimmy  what do I gotta do in this  Christ in this business  you have to pay for it  pay for it  because  one week in the hospital  will wipe you out  completely  you have to have it dude  even if it's expensive  you don't have a choice  do one gig  you don't want to do a month  or whatever  or do one gig  that is specifically for insurance  because you'll probably  never need it 
[03:06:30]  but the one time you do  it's like  you gotta fucking have it  it's like $600 a month  that's  nothing  that's six G's a year  what do you think a week  in a hospital costs you  or fuck  so you break your leg or something  you gotta have it man  $600 a month is nothing  you're a single guy  there's no dependents  it's just you  you're pretty healthy  you don't smoke  yeah I quit smoking  he drinks a lot though  I don't drink that much  he drinks a ton  that could cause problems  like a lot  he's been drinking  the whole fucking time here
