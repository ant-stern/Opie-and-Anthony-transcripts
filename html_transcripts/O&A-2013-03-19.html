<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the difficulties of hailing cabs in snowy New York City, fueled by the hosts' personal frustrations with price gouging and perceived bias. This segued into a critique of Mayor Bloomberg's anti-smoking campaign, particularly his proposal to hide cigarettes in stores, with a caller, Steve from Flint, Michigan, adding his perspective as a cigarette retailer.  The hosts then shared anecdotes about their own underage drinking and smoking experiences, contrasting their youth with current regulations.  This led to a discussion of the absurdity of the celebrity diving show "Splash," compared to classic shows like "All in the Family," before moving on to professional wrestling, specifically Fandango's comedic storyline and the use of Paul Bearer's death in WWE storylines involving CM Punk and the Undertaker.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and irreverent humor.

The show continued with more wrestling talk, focusing on Jericho, Fandango, and Bob Backlund's Hall of Fame induction, including humorous commentary on Backlund's "knee walk."  The Iron Sheik then appeared as a guest in studio, engaging in characteristically enthusiastic banter and insults related to the anniversary of the Iraq War's "shock and awe" campaign and the fall of Saddam Hussein's statue.  The hosts then played and discussed various versions of "House of the Rising Sun," criticizing the musicianship with sarcasm.  They moved on to discussing the anniversary of Randy Rhodes' death, Michael Jordan's baseball career, and Bo Jackson's athletic achievements and current pursuits (custom arrow making), with a caller providing additional details about Jackson's career and injury.  A lengthy, crudely edited audio piece about Anthony Cumia's fictional gay experience, featuring Jim Norton and a fictional Andrew Dice Clay, was played. The segment concluded with the hosts expressing significant frustration over the lack of support and communication from their company's PR and web departments, particularly regarding a delayed James Lipton interview video, with staff member Travis offering an explanation for the delay.

The next segment focused on the hosts' anger at SiriusXM's management and promotion, citing low view counts on their YouTube channel for videos featuring major celebrities compared to their own videos.  They discussed perceived incompetence in middle management and promotion, scheduling conflicts with their planned bus tour, and past difficulties with SiriusXM.  The hosts' dissatisfaction was described with profanity and humor, including a discussion of a prank show idea involving babies, a fake fire, and a lion, pitched to NBC.

A chaotic segment followed, beginning with a discussion of offensive list ideas ("50 funniest moments in child pornography," "Women with the worst smelling pussies in order of ethnicity"). This transitioned into discussions about an upcoming interview with Olga, a lingerie photoshoot, Nick Cage's appearance on Jimmy Fallon (including a plane ride anecdote), and ideas for a new show about marriage proposals involving a mock kidnapping and rape.  The hosts analyzed talk show visual presentations and reacted to a news story about a live television marriage proposal with disgust and amusement. A "Listener Show Prep" segment analyzed a Nick Cage clip from Jimmy Fallon's show.  They discussed a British man's penis reconstruction surgery with graphic detail and dark humor, mentioned a benefit show, an Opie and Anthony mixtape, and plans for a DJ battle featuring Denny, DJ Who Kid, and DJ Troy Kwan. A listener corrected the hosts' misidentification of Ross Perot.

The final segment began with a discussion of DJ Who Kid's style and a Dollar Shave Club commercial read.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy discussion about 80s and 90s television shows, including *Growing Pains*, *Pete and Pete*, *California Dreams*, and many more, with callers contributing memories and trivia.  Alan Thicke Jr. appeared as a guest, sharing anecdotes including his appearance on *Figure It Out*.  References were made to MTV vignettes, *The Wiz*, *Seinfeld*, and other shows. The segment concluded with another Dollar Shave Club commercial read.  The overall tone throughout the entire broadcast remained consistently vulgar and irreverent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  Antonio!  The dancing shrimp.  Home of the dancing shrimp.  Home of the dancing shrimp.  Alright.  Good enough.  Yeah.  There we go.  Morning everyone.  Oh yeah.  And ain't it a fine morning?  It sure is.  Winter holding on here in New York City.  Right. 
[00:00:30]  That was a cool little snowstorm we had.  Yeah it was.  Quick.  Easy.  Fun.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup. 
[00:01:00]  Yup.  And I'm flagging down delivery cars, and this guy passes me, and I'm like, what the fuck?  And he stops.  Oh, right.  So I'm like, dude, I'm going to 57th and 8th.  This is from 40, this is from next door.  Right.  Uh-huh.  It's a quick ride.  And he goes, 20 bucks.  Yeah.  And I was like, you fucking piece of...  I was like, no.  And he just drove away.  Yeah, gouging.  As soon as he did, I was like, why did I do that?  It was a pounding sleeve.  My fucking feet got soaked.  And I walked, it took me another 10 minutes to get, finally, another livery truck. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, no.  You do get mad at those guys, but that is convenient when they can stop and pick you up in the middle of a mess like that.  Yeah, they do price gouge.  And I guess I should have just expected, look, you got a guy just to drive, you'd be lucky.  But I was...  I took another guy.  Oh, Jimmy.  I walked like six blocks.  And for the last five blocks, I played 15 bucks.  So I really fucked myself.  So you fucking get set up for five bucks.  Well, why didn't you counteroffer the first guy?  Because he...  You say, hey, come on, man, 10.  Because he would have...  I was so angry.  I just didn't like him.  Right.  I was just so mad.  Right. 
[00:02:00]  It was stupid.  I should have just paid it and said, fucking, this guy's a cunt that hopefully will be killed.  When you really need a cab in New York, you can't find one.  You can't find one.  I mean, it's a nightmare.  When it's rainy or snowy, it's just a nightmare out there.  Dude, it was...  And the car, the guy called me and said that my car is going to be late for this.  And I was so angry.  I called.  I was screaming at the guy on the phone.  And I finally got a text at 10 after 10.  It was 920.  50 minutes late, the car came.  And they're just a shitty...  The fucking cars Fox users are awful.  Yeah.  They're always late. 
[00:02:30]  That sucks.  It was a problem.  That's a white guy's problem, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just cars being late.  Cars being late.  Gentlemen's accommodations.  Yeah.  A gentleman's problem.  Yeah.  You could be, you know, a black guy trying to hail a cab in that weather.  That ain't going to happen.  You know what?  That's not going to happen.  No, that has to happen now.  Well.  They're on to the scam.  Yeah, you talk to the cabbies.  They'll tell you.  They still fucking blow right past.  They'll tell you?  You have that conversation with them?  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes.  That's very frustrating.  Like lit cab lights going by? 
[00:03:00]  I can't stand fucking trying to hail cabs when it's busy.  Because it just always seems like you're trying to get a cab during that time where all the  off-duty lights are on, or there's just no fucking cabs.  Right.  And then you...  Why do all the cabs have to get back to the garage at the same time?  I don't know.  I never understood that.  But it's really a pain in the ass.  There is a time of day, it's around three or four, where all cabs are out of service  because their shifts are ending and they've got to get back to the garage. 
[00:03:30]  It's a pain in the ass.  Why wouldn't they alter that shit so there's always cabs?  I don't know.  But you're right.  Yeah.  It's like the same time.  And then you're trying to hail a cab and you see somebody down the block a little  and they're hailing, so you're like, oh, they're going to get the fucking cabs.  You've got to go upstream.  So you've got to keep moving.  You keep going upstream.  Fuck those people.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll turn around and fuck you.  It's every man for themselves out there.  They will.  It really is.  Who did the upstream thing?  Was that a Seinfeld bit?  Was it?  I think it might have been. 
[00:04:00]  I don't remember that.  You've got to keep going upstream, man, so the cab sees you first.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Especially when it's like shitty weather out like today.  Anyway, we were talking about Bloomberg's cigarette thing.  This guy.  Bloomberg and his war on cigarettes.  This guy.  Now, it's not the worst idea in the world, but it's just the fact that he continues to  take on these real easy little fucking things and thinks he's going to make a major difference  in this city.  Have you heard this one yet, Jimmy? 
[00:04:30]  It's a cigarette.  Yeah, okay.  He wants to make a mark by just doing so many of these things.  But they're little easy things.  Yeah.  And it's always against the little guy.  Yeah.  Why don't you take on the big fucking corporations, you fucking pussy?  Why don't you take on drinking, which is a major fucking problem?  And by the way, and I have to say it every time, I don't want him to do any of this stuff.  Yeah.  But if you're going to be that guy, why don't you go for the real tough shit?  He is that guy.  He loves these things.  He's not that guy.  No, he loves these things. 
[00:05:00]  He's tiny little fucking things.  It's always a tiny little fucking thing.  He loves them.  Here's the official announcement from the mayor himself.  We've come here today to announce the latest steps we're taking to reduce what remains  a persistent health risk, especially for our city's young people.  New York's Mayor Bloomberg announced his latest health initiative that would mandate tobacco  products such as cigarettes to be kept in cabinets or under the counter.  First, we're proposing legislation that would prohibit display of tobacco products in most 
[00:05:30]  retail establishments.  The reason?  Such displays suggest that smoking is a normal activity and they invite young people to experiment  with tobacco.  This is not a normal activity and experimenting when you have something that's addictive is  the first step to being addicted.  If Bloomberg is able to pass this law, the cigarettes could only be seen during purchase  and restocking.  These laws would protect New Yorkers, especially the young and impressionable New Yorkers, from  pricing, discounts and exposure to in-store displays that promote tobacco products. 
[00:06:00]  Products whose use is addictive and whose consequences can be deadly.  The measure is scheduled to be introduced March 20th.  So basically, you know, he doesn't want to get rid of the cigarettes, he just wants to hide  them.  Yeah.  Well, he wants to get rid of them, but he can't.  Yeah, of course he can't.  Because he's not going to take on big tobacco.  Right.  Take on those guys.  Instead of the mom and pop idiot that's trying to make a few bucks selling cigarettes.  This fucking...  I hate this.  I'll tell you what you do.  Huh.  You get rid of these cigarettes. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  And you stock up with Chulies gum.  Some nice Chulies gum.  Seinfeld.  Yeah.  What?  No.  That wasn't Seinfeld.  No, it wasn't.  Fuck.  Seinfeld's my go-to.  What was that from?  Look, have some Chulies.  I don't know.  That's from Clerks.  Oh.  Yeah.  Chulies.  Should've known that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's...  He fucking wants to enact all these...  And he loves saying, you know, in the first law of its kind... 
[00:07:00]  He loves New York City having the first law of its fucking kind.  And then he's hoping other cities are going to jump on board.  Of course.  But not one other city has jumped on board with that big sugary drink thing.  No, not that.  Because he's not giving up on that.  You know that.  Yeah.  He's regrouping.  The big thing was the smoking, like, bans and things like that.  I remember...  Did that start before him?  I'm pretty sure New York...  Yeah, it started before him.  It started with Giuliani.  New York was kind of one of the first places to really crack down on smoking.  Right.  And everyone else followed suit on that one. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  But he made it illegal to smoke even in parks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Parks.  Just everywhere.  As a guy that, you know, doesn't smoke and doesn't really want it around me, I was  like, really?  Even in parks?  That's just so stupid.  Yeah.  You pretty much can't smoke in your house.  You could smoke and they're trying to stop that.  Well, when you see a guy smoking outside a building, we've done this a lot.  It just looks really weird now.  It looks sickly.  It looks sad.  You want to go, what are you doing?  Right?  Did you stink like that? 
[00:08:00]  You're 50.  What the shit?  You're just puffing away.  You're just out in the cold having a cigarette?  Having a drag.  How could it be enjoyable anymore?  Obviously, it's a habit at that point.  But...  They all congregate around the sign that says, no smoking in this area.  Right.  So you're fucking, you're right there.  Nah, it's outside.  I never gave a shit about guys and gals smoking outside.  I quite frankly don't enjoy the people that smoke by the door, the revolving door, when  I have to wait there for my trunk.  Really?  I don't like the, because it's fucking, it doesn't matter that it's outside, that giant  fucking cloud of smoke just hangs there. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, but the exhaust coming by as the car passes, I would assume that's a little worse  than the guy's cigarette smoke.  I don't smell that as much as the smoke, cigarette smoke.  I fucking hate cigarettes.  Yeah, I don't like it.  Man, it's awful.  So he's going to try to hide cigarettes now, is what this comes down to.  And do you really think it's going to stop kids from fucking smoking?  Honestly, a tiny, tiny percentage.  An extremely, extremely small number.  All these things will help out an extremely small number of people.  You're not allowed to buy cigarettes. 
[00:09:00]  I know they sell them to kids and shit, but the law already says you're not allowed to  sell them cigarettes.  So it's, you're not really getting them.  You're getting them from your parents.  You're getting them from fucking, yeah.  You're getting them from your friends or whatever the fuck.  But when I was smoking, when I first started smoking, it had nothing to do with the fact  that I could see cigarettes in a store.  I knew they existed.  All my friends were smoking, and that's why I started smoking.  Well, that's why, though, you could see your friends smoking.  So he's thinking if he could get the numbers down, you're not seeing people smoking in general, 
[00:09:30]  and then you might not step into that world.  14 bucks a pack, that pretty much stops you from smoking.  Yeah, of course.  Shit like that.  And most of that is tax, right?  Yeah, tax.  A lot of tax on these cigarettes.  We were talking just before the show, you know, we used to get our booze and our cigarettes,  you know, you would hang outside a 7-Eleven.  Let's call it a 7-Eleven.  I don't even know if we had 7-Elevens when we were growing up.  If we did have 7-Elevens, there were not a lot of them.  Yeah.  Did we have 7-Elevens growing up? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I remember.  Out on Long Island, especially, sure.  But not as many as we have today, right?  Yeah, they were all over the place.  Okay.  We would be outside going, hey, mister, could you get us a six-pack?  Give me some cigarettes.  And you would always find someone that could do that for you.  But can you imagine if a kid came up to you today, you're in a parking lot of 7-Eleven,  going inside for whatever, and a kid's out there trying to talk you into getting a six-pack?  You would be wondering, where is the fucking hidden cameras?  Right, where's the fucking cops around the corner?  Where are the cops?  You would never accept that deal. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, that would look like a sting.  And you'd be on camera.  You'd be on camera out in front.  Right.  So if anything happened, they'd just review the tape and be like, oh, here's the guy that  gave the kid fucking booze.  It was commonplace when we were growing up.  Yeah.  You'd always find somebody.  Someone would buy it for you.  Like, oh, here, all right, here.  What do you want?  Yeah, all right.  What do you need?  All right, fine, here.  Hey, could you buy me some beers?  Right.  Yeah, here's some fucking beer and cigarettes.  You're just like, here you go.  Be a degenerate.  Even if, nowadays, if a kid, a strange kid approaches you, you just start screaming. 
[00:11:00]  Get away!  No!  This can't be good!  This can never be good!  You put your hands up.  I'm not molesting anyone!  Get away from me, you little fucker.  So the cigarette thing is just, uh, it's just ridiculous.  Did you get served?  I never got served liquor until I, I bought liquor once in my life, I think.  What do you mean?  I could never buy liquor once in my life.  Oh, I was always scared.  We did.  We tried, and we fucking...  Did you pass, though, for 21?  No, no, no.  No, because I always looked way younger than my age, so it was always with other friends 
[00:11:30]  and stuff.  I had a friend, John Ewing.  He looked like he was 20-something when he was 16.  He was 6'4".  He already could grow a fucking beard.  Yeah.  He got his license, like, at 16, and he was just, he was just on his own fucking, his  own fucking ride, man.  On another level, huh?  Oh, God, yeah.  We got everything through him, because he just looked like he was of age.  Looked the part.  Absolutely looked the part.  It was pretty lucky.  When I turned 18, it was 18, the fucking drinking age. 
[00:12:00]  And then they boosted it up to, like, 19.  Every year they boost it up a year, right?  19, yeah.  Yeah.  And then they made a law, I guess, a federal law, because they can't, here's how the feds  work all the time.  The federal, they can't override the state laws.  So if the state says they want 18-year-olds to be able to drink in their state, so be it.  That's the law.  But the feds said, all right, we're going to hold back all of your fucking federal funding 
[00:12:30]  for your highway systems if you don't boost it up to 21.  So they kind of blackmailed all the states to make it 21.  Of course they did.  It was the right move.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I think so.  But it's, you know, then they ought to actually make the voting age 21.  I agree.  And they ought to fucking make the draft or military age 21, things like that.  How did you show yourself, like, only because it's statistically a lot safer?  Like, you're not going to be a killed in the draft.  Yeah, they've proven it.  They've proven it.  We got tobacco wrap. 
[00:13:00]  He's going to explain how this will never go through.  So, Steve, in Flint, Michigan.  Hey, Mark.  Yes.  Wow.  Do you have the only job in Flint, Michigan?  Yes.  Matter of fact, I sell Newport.  So up there in the hood, I'm king.  Newport.  Is Flint, Michigan turning around at all?  Nah.  No.  Not so much.  You know, they're reporting it, but, I mean, Detroit's a mess.  Flint's just as bad and all that stuff.  That's crazy.  But regarding the tobacco thing, with the mayor wanting to, you know, hide or whatever, if 
[00:13:30]  you guys ever walked into a gas station or a party store.  I have.  That big display.  Yes.  The companies pay to have all that stuff displayed.  And if it's not displayed, then the stores will not get discounting, which will then increase  your cigarettes up another $2 a pack.  Exactly.  Product placement in the stores is very big.  Right.  So, you know the stores are making money for where they're putting things.  Yeah, obviously. 
[00:14:00]  Exactly.  And then, you know, with as big as some of those displays are, those guys aren't going  to be able to put, you know, a huge display under their counter or behind a wall or anything  like that.  So, you know, I mean, you guys already have the highest cigarettes in the nation, you know,  $12, $13 a pack.  If you go them up to $15 or $16, should the mayor decide to block that?  But the problem is it's a legal product.  Like, if you don't like it, how about this?  Again, this is why I hate Bloomberg so much.  Go after the insurance companies.  If someone has proven to be a smoker, we won't cover your health.  Like, if you want to do it that way.  But if it's a legal product, you can't tell people they can't show it. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Either make it illegal or shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Right.  I mean, that's how my life insurance is based.  If I'm a smoker, I pay more.  If I'm not a smoker, I pay less.  Do you smoke, sir?  No, I do not.  You're a fucking cancer merchant?  Yes, you don't smoke.  What's funny, when I interviewed, they told me that 70% of the people in our company do  not smoke.  But yet, you know, that's what we do.  When you sell cigarettes, is there a party that feels a little guilty?  And I'm not knocking you for your job.  Is there a party that feels like, eh? 
[00:15:00]  No, because, you know, I do this.  I used to sell Coca-Cola before, and that's just sugary syrup water that gives people diabetes  and makes them fast.  So I just moved from one to another.  Was that your sales pitch?  He was a hell of a sales pitch.  He was let go after one day.  Mr. No Commission.  I used that in my interview, and that's how I got the job.  My boss laughed.  He said, dude, you're hired.  Oh, jeez.  Wow, look at that.  All right.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Fucking cancer salesman.  So that legal drug dealer. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That went down yesterday.  I guess he was holding back the whole cigarette thing until the sugary drink thing went through,  and now this was going to be his next thing.  So he broke it out a little earlier than he wanted, I guess.  He just loves tying up the courts with these fucking little piddly shit ideas he has.  It's amazing.  And then he's embracing the fact that one of the papers here in New York shows him as  Mary Poppins with an umbrella over the city, being a nanny.  He's the nanny.  They love the nanny.  He acknowledged it at the press conference yesterday that he likes that. 
[00:16:00]  He likes that image of being Mary Poppins flying over the city protecting us all.  Of course he does.  Yuck.  Fucking fruit.  Yuck.  He's a fucking...  You know what it is?  When you put calorie counts on, that was genius because he gives people a choice.  Yeah.  But you can't make people's fucking minds up for him.  That's a choice.  Stop it.  You want to educate people as to the dangers of certain things.  Whatever.  That's it.  You know.  You can't just start taking things away like we're all children.  And the excuse is the children.  Every time you hear about how it's for the children. 
[00:16:30]  You know, our greatest resource is our children.  And we need to...  It's like, you know what?  Adults have grown and have the right to be able to make their own fucking decisions.  I completely agree with you.  Taking everything away.  I don't want anyone raising my fucking kids.  I'll fucking raise my kids.  I'll show them all the landmines.  You show them right.  You know?  You fucking tell them how bad smoking is and you educate them. 
[00:17:00]  Because I'm also an adult and I don't want my entertainment being, you know, curtailed.  Or watered down because the children are out there.  Oh, fuck no.  Like how...  We were trying to watch Shameless last night.  Oh.  I love that show.  Yes.  And there's a big, huge scene where he's in a shower just fucking banging some broad or something.  And then we looked at each other and went, oh, all right.  I guess we got to turn this off.  Oh, man.  Well, for a second we...  Just like, man, we'll watch it.  You can't distract him with something shiny? 
[00:17:30]  Throw a ball down the hallway or something?  Well, that's what you do.  You kind of look at the kid like, oh, he's distracted by his little toy over there.  So you can sneak in a few more minutes of maybe an adult, you know, show.  But then as soon as he starts becoming a way, you're like, oh, fuck, I gotta turn it off.  You gotta do the right thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I don't feel like my son should be seeing that yet.  Yeah.  So you gotta do the fucking right thing.  So we couldn't watch the rest of Shameless yesterday, which sucks.  God, that is such a fucking weird thing.  What?  I don't know.  It's just like, I would be so pissed. 
[00:18:00]  Would you be pissed?  I am so fucking selfish with my time and what I like, things like that.  Like, if I want to watch something, I'd be like, ah, this little fucker, he's taking  up my...  Instead of watching Shameless, then, you know, I watched Special Agent Ozo with him, which  was wonderful.  Oh, my God.  It's just like watching Shameless.  Wow.  It really is.  It's pretty similar.  I'm a hot girl in the fucking shower. 
[00:18:30]  Three special steps.  That's all you need.  Three special steps.  I need 12.  24 if you really want to get into it.  Wow.  March 19, 2013.  An acknowledgement.  Let me write that down.  So, Bloomberg.  Yeah.  I guess we can move on from that.  There it is.  Special Agent Ozo.  What does he do?  Oh, he just flies around and helps out little kids. 
[00:19:00]  Like, yesterday, some kid couldn't figure out what to bring into show and tell.  Oh.  So, he flew all the way to this kid's room to look at his stuff to see what would be the  best for show and tell.  Oh.  And it's all based on three special steps.  Oh.  Is that the actual song?  Yeah, start it over.  I know the song very well.  I've never heard this.  This is his go-to show right now.  Thank God he's past Caillou.  Thank God.  Sir Agent Ozo, Mr. Dose here.  It's a chilling situation.  Tyler wants to make frozen juice pops for his twin sister, Lily. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  But he doesn't know how.  What?  Your special assignment, help Tyler make frozen juice pops.  Will you help me out with this special assignment?  Great.  Paul Pilot, what special steps will I need today?  Paul Pilot.  Three special steps.  Oh.  That's all you need.  Three special steps.  Why is that thing wearing a bra on her head?  Your special assignment is starting now.  And three special steps will show you how.  Show you how.  Step one.  Fill an ice cube tray with juice.  And two. 
[00:20:00]  Put a toothpick.  Step three.  Freeze the juice pop.  Oh, that's it.  Three special steps.  So now you know.  Three special steps and you're ready to go.  The checklist has all the steps you need.  Just follow them all and you will succeed with three special steps.  The dumb kid just fills them up with toothpicks.  Doesn't know what he's doing.  Fills the ice cube tray with toothpicks.  Throws the juice over his head.  The name of the song should be, what else could it be? 
[00:20:30]  Look at this tray.  What do you think goes in here?  You know, it's, that show does nothing for adults.  There's some of these kid programs.  There's definitely some adult shit you could enjoy.  Like, Spongebob is a good example.  Fairly Odd Parents is a good one.  So they're out there.  When he gets, you know, connected to one of those shows, you can sit there and watch with  them.  Yeah.  But this, there's nothing for adults to enjoy.  They really have pumped up the whole music thing with these kids shows. 
[00:21:00]  It's like every one of them has these fucking songs.  Yeah, it has to have a single.  It's crazy.  I got to watch that instead of Shameless.  That's great.  It's smart, though, man, because kids want all the toys and the fucking products.  Oh, man.  A lot of money, then.  That's the other thing I've noticed, because I'm watching so much kid programming.  They make fucking kid toys look amazing.  Yeah.  But if you really look close, you'll see how lame they really are.  They've always done that with commercials.  The cutaways.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  There's some dumb Barbie outdoor swimming pool water park thing.  Oh, it's horrendous.  But the commercial makes it look pretty fucking amazing.  Yeah, she's fucking having to piss her.  But they show Barbie sliding down the slide, and then it's the cutaway, because you know  she just fucking falls floppy at the end of the slide.  Too big for the pool.  Is that the Barbie water park?  That looks terrible.  I know, but the commercial makes it look like, whoa, look at this.  Whoa, crazy.  A little doggy goes around. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know if this is the one I saw.  A little wheel.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah, they got these close-up shots.  Yeah, exactly.  That looks like a piece of shit.  Why is her head turning?  Like Amy Schumer?  Like Amy does that psychotic head turn to one direction?  They just show Barbie turning her head, but they don't show you the little fingers that  have to fucking turn the head.  So it makes it look like, oh my god, your Barbie will move by itself.  I need that.  I was watching a channel that in the morning turns into another fucking channel. 
[00:22:30]  There was a movie on, and I fell asleep.  And I woke up, and Strawberry Shortcakes was on.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but I couldn't find the remote fast enough, and I wanted to shoot my television.  Every voice is like,  And you're just hearing this high-pitched fucking squealing in your head.  Oh, it was terrible.  I don't know that one.  We gotta take a look.  It's terrible.  Wait, how does... 
[00:23:00]  What channel are you on then?  I don't know.  It turned into a kids' program.  The Hub.  The Hub turned into fucking, like, kids' shit.  What were you watching on The Hub?  Because The Hub is pretty much kids' shit.  At night, it was something else.  Really?  What were you jerking off to on The Hub?  No, at night, it's something else.  I don't know about that.  I've never seen it be anything but kids' programs.  Had to be, unless I rolled over on the remote.  Yeah.  Because I think at night it was...  Or maybe even...  I think at night, it's another channel.  Like another station. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, maybe out there on Long Island, they split the...  And then they split the times.  They split the times.  Yeah, yeah.  In the morning, it turns into The Hub.  No, in New York City, The Hub is just kids' shit all day long.  This isn't...  I'm kind of stuck.  Oh, my God.  When you're just listening to these voices, they all have giant...  Me, me, me, me, me, me.  It's terrible.  They all have giant heads and little bodies.  That's what every kids' show has.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, giant heads, little bodies.  It's all caricatures.  Yeah.  Fucking poop.  No.  And they're all dorgell, helpful. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, mom needs help making a meatloaf.  Well, let's all get the sauce, everybody.  Yay!  What the fuck's wrong with people?  Isn't that a song about the meatloaf?  Yeah, we need the meatloaf, the meatloaf, the meatloaf.  Oh, no, where's the meatloaf?  The meat's not going to be tender.  How about the old days?  A fucking rabbit shooting japs.  Yes.  That's what I like.  Exactly.  Flintstones had big heads, though.  They had the big heads.  The kids did.  Little necks.  Yeah, I guess Wilma did, too.  Fred Flintstone had a massive dome. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  He had a big body, too.  I think that was always kind of common to make the heads a little bigger.  But Bugs was, you know, regular size.  Oh, yeah.  Scooby-Doo.  Daffy.  Yeah, my kid gets into the Scooby-Doo a little bit, thank God.  Really?  That brings me back a little bit, seeing some of the older cartoons.  The Jetsons, he got into it a little bit.  Oh, well, there you go.  A little bit.  Future looks bright.  Yeah.  That old guy.  Of course.  Pope Francis is boring the shit out of everybody in the Vatican. 
[00:25:00]  Enough.  There's a pope.  We know it.  That's it.  Enough with the pope news.  No, no.  This is the day where he becomes officially the pope.  Oh, he's installed?  It's a big celebration, yeah.  They install him.  Supposedly there's like a million people over there right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was trying to watch some of the coverage.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how they could pump it up and make it exciting.  Yeah, make it exciting.  Wow.  It's just that monotone.  He shocked his security by getting out of the car and talking to people. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, good for him.  I actually like this guy a lot more than that last tool.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see if he keeps it up.  But they're going to shut him down.  They're going to be, look, you just can't do that.  Sorry.  People are taking pot shots at the old Pope of Rooney.  Yeah, because he doesn't control his life anymore.  No.  Right now, they give him a little something something.  But after today, he's going to be in lockdown.  He's very important.  To who?  To the Catholics.  To the Catholics?  The Catholic.  Yeah.  So what does that entail?  I guess Joe Biden went over there, huh?  Well, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  He's the first Catholic vice president.  He's the guy that goes over there and says, hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  I'm representing America.  Yeah.  And the delegation.  I don't know how much that costs.  You think the Obama-Satan thing was on purpose?  No.  Or is that just a coincidence?  No.  You know what?  They got one picture of him.  And they put it next to a picture of Obama that looks like, you know, the same type of pose.  It's like those separated at birth pictures.  Right.  You know?  And you look at him, and then you look at two other pictures, and it looks nothing like him.  Right. 
[00:26:30]  Because the guy that actually plays that Satan guy in the Bible miniseries that's on, he looks nothing like Obama.  At all, in real life.  So, nothing.  But then they make him up, and they can have made him up any way.  Yeah.  And the way they made him up makes him look like Obama.  Is there another picture of him as the devil?  That's him on the left.  That's the actual guy.  But they had to know that he was starting to look like Obama when he started putting the makeup on the guy.  Really?  I don't know, man. 
[00:27:00]  It's a little too close.  Kind of funny.  It might have just been one of those things.  It's probably just a coincidence, though, right?  If it was Bush, they would do it.  But with that president, why not?  You know, or maybe they just do this shit knowing that it gets a little more attention for their project.  I don't know.  Because the guy...  You think it's just a complete coincidence?  Why wouldn't they hire a guy that looked like Obama?  The guy looks nothing like Obama without the makeup on.  Well, my point is, I don't think they went into it, you know, going, this is what we're going to do.  But then when they...  They had to know when they were making him up as Satan that he was starting to look like Obama. 
[00:27:30]  And they probably said, ah, this isn't the worst thing for us.  It'll get people talking.  Hmm.  And I've only seen that one angle.  I hear what you're saying.  If they were going to go for this, they would have absolutely found someone that definitely looks like Obama to begin with.  I get it.  Yes.  Yes.  I've only seen that one shot of him.  And every picture that they compare Obama with, he's making the same face kind of thing.  Well, what about the Bush head?  Bush head was Bush head.  They made sure, right?  Yeah, it was Game of Thrones. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  Oh, right.  The head was up on the spike.  Yeah.  On the pike.  Did they admit that that was on purpose?  They said that they were using various heads that were around the lot.  And one of them was of George W.  But they just were like, oh, grab as many of these heads as we can get.  Because that show apparently uses a lot of fucking heads.  Oh, okay.  But, you know.  Of course that was on purpose.  Of course it was on purpose.  To the camera.  Right, yeah.  I don't know.  It's a political, you know, whatever. 
[00:28:30]  That's what you get when you're the president.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  By the way, it's another thing I don't give a fuck about.  Yeah, yeah.  But people take it very seriously.  They're pissed off that Satan looked a little too much like Obama.  Like Obama.  I don't care.  I don't know.  I see on the computer is the commercial for Splash.  Did you see that?  Did you see Louis Anderson?  Yeah.  I don't know what that show is.  What is it?  It could be the worst show ever fucking conceived.  I just saw Louis falling off a fucking platform into a pool.  Right, because he can't dive whatsoever.  It's a bunch of celebrities learning how to dive for a week or two. 
[00:29:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, Dancing with the Stars.  But only with the diving?  I think Louganis is the main guy, right?  Oh, boy.  Greg Louganis is there showing him how to dive.  And then you've got these goofy celebrities that don't have the bodies for diving to begin with.  Yeah, so it's a freak show, but we're not allowed to say that, I guess.  How did Louis Anderson fucking agree to that?  Louis Anderson is well over 300 pounds, and he's in, like, a yellow wetsuit.  He looks ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  Is Kareem on this one?  Yeah.  And Kareem is, what, 7'2"? 
[00:29:30]  And 60-something years old, and he's trying to learn how to dive?  Yeah.  What's this commercial?  Goddamn commercials on the intratubes.  It's kind of out of control, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  It's great, though, because it's hurting TV.  Well, it certainly is.  It's fucking money.  It's not going to TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  TV didn't think this internet was going to be a big deal.  Of course, the dummies.  It's going to be like Mel.  Just, you know, nah, there's no way to really make money off of it.  Nah, there's no way to really make money off of it.  I'm Kendrick Wilkinson.  Full screen, please. 
[00:30:00]  You're on this.  I don't know.  I dated Hugh Hefner for five years, and I lived at the Playboy Nation.  People ask why I'm famous, and my answer is, I have no idea.  She's what they call a coal burner.  Is she?  I am who I am, and people like it for some odd reason.  I want some real dick.  Help!  She just...  I have a Grammy party to go to today.  When I got to my first day of boot camp, I was like, I've got this.  I'm climbing up the ladder.  At least the music is different than reality shows normally. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, God.  They're doing something a little different.  I didn't expect it to look that high.  They're trying to make drama.  About diving into a pool.  About diving into a pool.  Yeah.  This is the dumbest idea for a show.  Would I push her?  I like this.  She's married to Hank Baskin.  What is Hank Baskin?  A little NFL guy.  I'm not really sure where he's at in the NFL these days, but...  Kendra's biggest challenge is Kendra.  He has the AIDS, right?  I guess. 
[00:31:00]  Does he?  Yeah.  Yeah, because when there was a drop of blood in the pool, then he's fucking freaked out.  It was like the fucking duty scene from Caddyshack.  I don't like him.  Oh, this is fucking horrendous.  Wow, this is...  What is this?  This isn't a commercial.  This is a whole long fucking piece on Kendra.  I wanted to see the Louie Anderson looking like a complete...  Yeah, where's Louie?  ...fucking wrecking ball.  And he just falls off the platform.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he's not even diving. 
[00:31:30]  That's what they want.  ABC is counting on this.  They are promoting the hell out of Splash.  I saw the ad for it, and I was trying to figure out what it was, and it went through  my head that maybe it's a diving show.  Yeah.  And I said, no, that couldn't be.  That's it.  Because that's the dumbest idea ever.  Yeah, that's it.  And apparently it is.  That's all it is.  A diving show.  Yeah, and then they get judges, and they're going to fucking, you know, do some dives  and get judged on.  There it is.  Yeah.  And celebrities, an NBA champion, an NFL lineman, a Miss Alabama, a girl next door, a comic legend, 
[00:32:00]  a Cosby kid.  It's the event they've been trading for.  So nervous right now.  And the one America's been waiting for.  Cosby kid jumping in the pool?  Oh, boy.  Dropping the...  Yeah.  Dropping the Cosby kid off the pool.  Holy shit.  Look at Louie.  Look at Louie.  What was that?  That's it.  That's their big grabber, too.  It's the last thing they showed was Louie falling off a platform.  Yeah, he's just going to be doing cannonballs and belly flops.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  He can't move his body like a diver.  No.  He's on the show so we can all look and laugh at him.  Of course.  He's a comedy legend.  What is he doing?  It's just another non-written, dumb show.  Yes, yes.  It's like that's all it is now.  It's going to do millions of views.  It takes no money.  No money to make it.  Right.  No writers.  No talent to make it right.  No writers.  Some corny fake drama.  Boom.  Get bass.  I didn't think I could do this. 
[00:33:00]  Like...  Song change.  This is higher than I thought.  Commercial.  Commercial.  Cut to commercial.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking nonsense.  Again, I bring it up a lot, but I have the entire collection of All in the Family.  And I was just going through some episodes over the weekend.  Fucking the writing.  It's all about the fucking writing and the acting. 
[00:33:30]  Just hilarious.  Curious.  Great.  And now you just get this shit.  Because we allowed the PC police to take over.  We should have said, shut up.  We enjoy what's on TV.  Leave us alone.  Leave us alone.  We like what we hear on the radio.  Because most people do like what they hear on the radio and see on TV.  They didn't need it adjusted.  They watched this garbage in droves, though.  So you'll see.  They'll be like, oh, the diving...  Have you seen Splash? 
[00:34:00]  Did you see Splash last night?  No.  Because that's all that's on.  But the fact that the internet is getting so many views and cable TV...  Yeah, FX.  Like Game of Thrones, whether it's Shameless or fucking Homeland.  All of these shows are getting so much attention.  It shows you that people really are tired of this fucking fruity mainstream television nonsense.  Some of the dramas on TV are pretty good.  Yeah.  Or popular.  But it's just shit.  It's utter shit. 
[00:34:30]  I was watching Legit yesterday.  I was catching up on Legit.  What is it about?  A little legal show?  Jim Jefferies' new show on FX.  It's terrific.  I like it.  Yeah.  I saw the paparazzi episode.  Ah.  Where he banged a local morning show broad.  Kind of the Jill Nicolini of L.A. sort of.  Right.  And then the paparazzi had Jim Jefferies in the broad leaving the comedy club.  And then he wakes up and she wakes up.  And they're like, oh, what the fuck?  She was like disgusted that she went home with Jim Jefferies. 
[00:35:00]  So it is like the Nicolini section.  And then she was ready to leave and there's all the photographers right outside, you know,  Jim Jefferies' apartment.  Oh, boy.  It was good.  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  And definitely edgy.  And his accent is endearing, doesn't it?  Sure.  Sure.  Why not?  Is that the whole episode online?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to, you know, spoil the rest of it.  I'm just giving you the setup.  Ooh.  In case people haven't seen it yet.  No spoilers.  No spoilers. 
[00:35:30]  No spoilers.  We learned our lesson.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, you know, Jim Jefferies is no fan.  Dan.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  My Twitter now fucking explodes every time this guy wrestles.  Well, it almost wrestles.  Iraq has this music.  Of course he does.  Just queued up and ready to go.  And we're not finally being influenced by Sam and his wrestling.  We really aren't.  No.  We have blown off wrestling for so many years.  But I took a peek, I don't know, like two weeks ago at this point. 
[00:36:00]  Because Sam tweeted that some of the old guys, the old school guys were on Raw, I think it was.  So I went over there and then I saw this whole Fandango storyline.  And I'm all in.  It's so ridiculous.  It's ridiculous and funny.  And basically he comes out and he will not wrestle until people, you know, say his name properly.  How many weeks has he attempted to wrestle?  I think four.  He's up to four weeks.  Yeah.  I think so.  And did he wrestle last night?  And they keep, like, this time they were really trying to sell. 
[00:36:30]  He's actually going to wrestle tonight.  He really is.  And he walked to the ring and everything.  So is this the first time he's actually walked to the ring?  Yeah.  He doesn't walk to the ring because he's got a dance partner.  Well, he dances to the ring.  It's kind of like a dance with the stars kind of thing, right?  Yeah.  And they gave him a much bigger set.  Right.  Like they gave him his own curtain to come out from.  What, last night?  And big pyro and everything.  So they're really catering to this guy because they want him to wrestle.  But the problem is no one says his name right.  It is the dumbest thing.  It's so retarded that it's funny. 
[00:37:00]  Do you like it?  Are you in on this or no?  I love it.  I love it.  All right.  I just think it's so stupid.  It's so Vince.  Right.  It's great.  And he's kind of what?  A ballroom dancer?  He's got a nice hot dancing broad with him?  Yeah.  They basically just were like, okay, it's like dancing with the stars except nobody can  say his name right.  Yeah.  Now, I would love to know how this is going to play out.  I don't think they know how it's going to play out.  Is that how they work this shit?  Absolutely.  They just tried this and went, you know, if it doesn't work, it doesn't matter. 
[00:37:30]  He'll never show up again.  But they know this is working.  It's getting heat.  Exactly.  So now they're like, oh, fuck, we got to figure this out.  Right.  Is that how it works over there sometimes?  100%.  Yeah.  Don't you think the move would be for him to never wrestle and then somehow, I don't  know, Vince fires him or something, just has enough with this guy?  He won't wrestle until this gets stale and then they'll just figure something out at  the last minute.  But then when he wrestles, it's over.  They got to figure something out then, but they'll worry about that then.  It's like when you got a guy and a girl on a TV series and, you know, the whole 
[00:38:00]  series is based on will they get together?  Will they get together?  Oh, the sexual tension.  And then once they get together, show's over.  Right.  Show's fucking over.  Moonlighting is the prime example.  Let's see how it went down last night.  You want to see if he wrestled, right?  Yes, of course.  I didn't see this last night.  Okay.  Make sure he can get his name right.  Oh, so he's made it all the way down to the ring.  Yeah.  Wow.  What's so great about that? 
[00:38:30]  He picked the woman up, put her on the table.  You don't appreciate the fine art of dance.  Showmanship.  Now he's getting in the ring, which is pretty amazing.  He jumps right over the ropes.  First time in the ring.  Yeah.  And then look at this.  You see the way contact.  This guy in the ring.  He's got a whole big lighting display and everything.  Huge.  Why does wrestling tolerate this and play his music?  Right.  Instead of just making him wrestle.  Exactly.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Oh, here we go. 
[00:39:00]  This is so dumb.  Stop.  He must be like, this rules.  I got heat.  This is amazing.  I don't know why.  A ton of heat and he hasn't wrestled a minute yet.  Never sure.  Too stupid to pronounce my name correctly.  That's what the voice.  You don't like it, Jim?  It's just awful.  So I was thinking tonight, why don't we let the beautiful, sensual, Canadian slice of heaven, 
[00:39:30]  Natalia, give it a try.  What is he doing?  He's terrible.  He's terrible at the mic work.  He's terrible.  Don't be afraid of all this masculinity, okay?  This is awful.  That's why I love it.  Of course.  It's okay.  So all she has to do is say his name properly.  And we got a match, right? 
[00:40:00]  We got a match.  All right.  Good.  All right.  She's got the mic.  Go get him, Colleen.  Oh, shit.  Wait, where's he going?  Why did he run out of the ring?  Oh, wait, wait.  He's got the mic, though.  No, no, he's dead.  No, no.  The people are booing.  Oh, are they booing the shit out of him? 
[00:40:30]  I don't blame them.  Exactly.  Well, why is it he?  Tonight was the night where you almost got to see the debut of.  They're chanting, you can't wrestle at him.  You can't wrestle at him.  You can't wrestle at him.  For the goal. 
[00:41:00]  What a shit gimmick this is.  Oh, it's awful.  What a tool.  It's so stupid.  Quickly becoming the biggest heel on the show.  It's amazing.  Yes, for doing nothing.  He gets booed.  I love the chants.  You can't wrestle.  Oh, it's so bad.  And you can just hear people in the front row that the camera's picking up. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  When he was like, oh, and he's like, boo!  And go, nobody cares!  Nobody cares!  I'm so mad.  That's why it's great.  It's great.  People have had it.  Everybody's tuning in to see the action, and he's just not giving them anything.  Nothing.  That's just it, yeah.  What a great idea for a heel.  He's just fucking terrible.  It's absurd.  It really is.  Vince must be laughing his ass off at this one.  He's laughing at him.  Hilarious. 
[00:42:00]  Hilarious.  That is great.  He's not even a good mic guy, though.  You watch him stretch the lovely.  Yeah, I know.  Ugh.  Yeah, the whole thing is just cheesy as all hell.  He walks behind that curtain and vances, good shit, Fandango, good shit.  Fandango, once again, you pissed them all off.  It's fantastic.  We can keep this going for another month easily.  We're taking this one to WrestleMania.  Vince dragging his writers into a room.  All right.  Write something for next week. 
[00:42:30]  He's got a much bigger entrance than almost anybody on the roster.  It's amazing.  Lights and fucking the music.  He's got a chick.  He's dancing.  They put out a wooden dance floor at the entranceway when he walks out.  Just for him to do a little dance with his girl.  And then he walks into the ring, and then he turns back around and goes home.  Who's going to mispronounce your name next week?  This is great.  This is so good.  What a great gimmick this is.  It's awesome.  Fandango get him.  Yeah, that was a little rough. 
[00:43:00]  It was terrible.  That was a little rough.  What does he say?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  So he doesn't pronounce the N, I'm noticing.  I think that's the...  Fa.  In the...  Da.  Go.  Go.  I think that's how he said it.  He didn't say Dan.  You've got to make sure you let the A's breathe.  I know.  I remember that from last week.  Let the A's breathe.  We're trying.  You're going to get another tweet from him?  Yeah, he tweeted me, too.  He did?  Yes, he did.  What are you right?  Oh, no.  He hasn't tweeted me again. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, damn.  I think that was one and done.  I'm eagerly awaiting the second tweet from Fandango.  No, that was just the listeners getting involved.  I don't think he knows that we even exist.  Then they put him back on TV later in the night and had him do a promo with Chris Jericho,  who also refused to pronounce his name.  Well, of course.  Yeah, I love the guys that refused to even attempt it.  That's great, too.  How does Jericho say it?  He started saying a bunch of things that rhyme with Fandango, except he did have a funny  when Fandango was leaving. 
[00:44:00]  He said, Fandango, wait, wait.  I didn't order my movie tickets.  Oh, see.  Because Fandango is where you get your movie tickets.  Yes, I got it.  Is Chris good on the mic?  Yes, he's very good.  He's really good, right?  He's one of the best.  Oh, wow.  Guys.  No, really.  He's one of the best ever.  Right?  Yeah.  You put him up there?  He made his career that way.  Yeah.  Quite amazing.  And I guess, what is it?  Punk is fucking just defacing and degrading.  Last night. 
[00:44:30]  Paul Bear's urn?  Yeah, he was playing football with it.  He dropped it on the ground.  Did ashes come out?  No.  He was like, ah, the lid almost came off.  Ah, they gotta have the ashes pop out.  They are fucking using the dead body of...  The actual...  I doubt it's actually the dead body.  No, of course not.  But...  They're using his death as a little storyline.  The entire Punk Undertaker match is based on the fact that Paul Bearer actually died a  week and a half ago.  That's so...  And it's gonna be in WrestleMania. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Part of WrestleMania.  Wow.  So you know the urn will be at WrestleMania.  That's probably when they...  It's gonna get spilled?  Yeah, they're gonna probably throw the fucking dust or whatever right in the Undertaker's  face.  Oh, man.  Could you imagine that?  Poof.  Oh, my God!  That's probably why they didn't spill the dirt, the dust yet.  Yeah.  They're saving that big reveal for WrestleMania.  Now, how did he get his hands on the urn?  Right.  Why is the cameraman filming this instead of the company saying you gotta give it back?  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's HR when you need them?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  He stole it during a tribute and then he hit Kane in the head with it.  Really?  Oh, man.  Oh.  And HR's not involved?  Nah, they're not a big HR company.  They let it get settled in the ring.  And this guy's just watching?  The Undertaker's fucking pissed.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he's mad.  Does he not talk or does he talk to the Undertaker?  He doesn't really talk.  Not much.  I am a higher power.  And I'm not gonna tell you I was born to beat the streak or that it's my destiny.  No.  I'm the one man in the world. 
[00:46:00]  I can't believe they brought in the actual death into...  Of course you can believe it.  Yeah, that's good.  Grab the urn.  Right.  Hey, he's dead.  Fuck him.  Get out of the floor.  You think he at least asked the family for their permission?  Nah, I wouldn't think so.  So the family somewhere is like, what the fuck is he doing?  He owns Paul Bear.  Why would he...  That was my father.  I own your father.  Dead or alive.  He's mine.  Whether he was walking around or whether he's in this urn. 
[00:46:30]  I created your father.  I killed him.  Can we get Vince on the show again?  It's been a long time.  That's great.  Does he do phoners anymore?  Very seldom.  Could you ask your people?  Yeah, absolutely.  We'd love to get him on.  Gotta make some phone calls.  You gotta call some people.  Especially as we head toward Wrestlemania.  I would love to do a little interview with Vince.  Here's Punk dropping.  It's been a while.  D'Ern.  Oh, he drops it.  Let's see.  He's just...  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  The stop almost came off.  Again, no disrespect intended.  It sounds very empty, by the way.  They should have put something in it.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  It's more symbolic than anything else.  Oh, it was very hollow.  And you know, the thing is, I don't even believe Punk when he says no disrespect intended.  Ah.  I think full disrespect is intended.  I think you're right.  That is very disrespectful.  And we love CM Punk.  Of course.  He fucking rules.  He came to our gig in Chicago.  Brock is fighting at Wrestlemania, too.  Brock is? 
[00:47:30]  Mm-hmm.  So who's...  Punk is fighting...  Undertaker.  Undertaker.  Who's Brock fighting?  Triple H.  And we're all going.  I'm actually going.  It's the first time I've ever heard.  You're going to go, too?  Oh, yeah.  We're all going.  It's entertaining.  It's all hell.  Yeah, I want to go.  Rock is wrestling.  Yeah, Wrestlemania is great.  And the Rock is wrestling against who?  Cena.  Actually, I've never had a bad time at a wrestling match.  Back at NEW when they were really...  We were all in with wrestling.  They gave us tickets for everything.  It's a great show.  Every time they were at Madison Square Garden, I went.  I went with Jay Moore once.  He sat there.  Jay Moore. 
[00:48:00]  Me and him sat there as goofballs watching the whole thing go down.  Who's Jericho fighting?  They haven't announced this match yet, but he'll have a match.  Who do you think his match will be against?  I don't know.  It'll be a...  Fandango.  That'd be great.  And Jericho doesn't even get to wrestle because Fandango...  Oh, because Fandango...  You think they'd do that at Wrestlemania?  Jericho would force him into the ring or something.  Yeah.  Jericho's big enough.  But I don't know who the...  Jericho will probably be a little bit lower on the card.  He'll be used to boost somebody else up or something.  Boost.  It'd be amazing if Fandango had the most amazing move ever. 
[00:48:30]  Like he finally starts wrestling and he does like this just amazing fucking thing.  That no one has ever seen before.  And it's like, what the fuck?  It's what we were waiting for.  It's what we were waiting for.  And well worth the wait.  Like the knee walk or something?  Uh, what?  That's Bob Backlund's move.  The knee walk.  You know Bob Backlund's getting inducted into the Hall of Fame.  I've heard.  Oh, wow.  Good for him.  He's going to be in Madison Square Garden to get inducted.  Madison Square Garden.  Greatest city in the world.  I humble you.  I fuck you in the ass. 
[00:49:00]  I fucking humble you as I piss my pants.  As a kid, you got excited by Bob Backlund's knee walk.  I hated him.  The knee walk.  I got invited to do the Iron Sheik Roast.  Really?  But I can't, I forget, I'm away doing a gig or something.  Roasting the Iron Sheik?  That would be cool as hell.  It's a counter-line.  It's not a TV.  Oh.  Yeah, but this will be fun.  Wow.  I just don't know what it is.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right, why don't we, we'll take a break, get into some other things. 
[00:49:30]  You're humbled.  Yeah.  I think I'm working somewhere else for lots of money.  Oh, hey.  Syracuse this weekend, right?  Selling very, very well.  Watch your penny on the way in.  Syracuse should be a good market for you.  It's selling great.  And Caroline's is selling well, too.  You're on the outskirts of the Rochester market.  And Wheeze has always been a huge supporter.  So I think they'll come out in droves.  We're in Syracuse.  Saturday's already sold out.  Damn.  What is, it's a funny bonus call.  I think it's a new club.  How old is it?  About an hour from Rochester? 
[00:50:00]  Maybe slightly more than that.  Okay.  About 90.  I want to say 90 minutes.  I haven't done that drive in a while.  But yeah, maybe 90 minutes.  But the outskirt of Wheeze's audience probably, and the outskirts of Syracuse kind of, you know.  So you'll probably get some Wheeze people going to the show.  I'm happy.  It's kind of what I wanted to lead into Boston with, you know, a good fucking, last year  it was Cincinnati right before it.  It was like, ugh.  Yeah.  It's nice to have a fucking show.  But they asked you to go to Cincinnati.  Nah, but I just didn't love the shows.  The fans asked you. 
[00:50:30]  They said, when are you coming to Cincinnati?  Oh, yeah.  When are you coming to Cincinnati?  And you went there.  The fans that came out were great.  But there's just not enough of them in some of these markets.  No.  Right.  I have to be realistic.  Nah, you'll do very well in Syracuse.  Now this.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opium bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man. 
[00:51:00]  come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan Madison  Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  Pleasure for me to I come back here again. 
[00:51:30]  One more time to I talk to the Opium and Anthony and pleasure for me always.  The Opium and Anthony Show.  Was this all just to kill?  I guess so, huh?  I do enjoy this song. 
[00:52:00]  This is a good fucking favorite anthem.  Yeah.  You keep on shouting.  You keep on shouting.  Put your hands together, people!  Such a simple song, man, but still good. 
[00:52:30]  I guess just to kill 38 years ago today.  Whoa.  I would have went with Dylan myself there.  What was off Bob Dylan's first album that was released 51 years ago today?  You like the Bob Dylan, right?  Not really. 
[00:53:00]  Not really.  Not one song.  You got to like one.  Not really.  You almost like...  How does that turn into...  How does a guy change that drastically?  I don't know.  Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, Crows, but Big Brass, Bill.  And then... 
[00:53:30]  What was off the debut album 51 years ago today?  Let me take a look here.  I can't see.  God damn it.  10th anniversary of shock and awe, too.  Yeah.  Shock and awe.  Well, we need Dennis to do this day in history for us.  I was thinking he could do this day in history for us.  Yeah.  But it has to be like with a little ONA twist somehow.  You know what I mean?  We can't just do it to do it. 
[00:54:00]  Was it the shock and awe or was it the 10th anniversary of the actual fall of Baggy Dad?  10 years ago today, the statue flopped over like a limp dick.  That's different.  They were going for that fucking big moment and it just...  Who knew he had a big tube up his ass, that statue?  Yeah.  Who knew there was a big metal fucking pipe going up his leg and shit?  They thought it was just going to fall over.  They expected that, you know, that crash and the dust to go flying everywhere.  It just sat there.  Just went...  Like he's laying down.  That sucked.  That did suck. 
[00:54:30]  Like the savages hitting a statue with their shoes.  Well, you know...  What a dumb insult.  I know.  Here's my shoe in your head.  I hit with shoe.  I hit with shoe.  Means very bad thing here.  Shut up.  What happened to the middle finger?  Just fucking flipping the bird.  Yeah.  Take your shoe off.  One of my favorite insults is where you take your hat and you turn the brim to the left  and you go, shucka, shucka.  Oh, man.  Two turns to the left.  You give one an insult.  Yeah.  It means your father's mother wears her hat crooked. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  We're going to go with a Dylan song here, eh?  51 years ago today.  Yeah.  House of the Rising Sun.  Baby.  How?  He knew how old it was.  50 years old, that song?  No.  That song goes...  Oh, I mean his version.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That song goes...  They don't even know where that song started.  I don't...  There's all sorts of different little versions.  Yeah.  Some of those old blues guys.  Maybe Lead Belly is one of them.  Terrible.  What do you got under House of the Rising Sun?  There we are.  Oh, it sounds like shit. 
[00:55:30]  I like that.  I love it.  They stole the black man's music.  Yeah, and made it so much better.  Shut up.  Is it Lead Belly?  There's a version of House of the Rising Sun.  I'm not sure if it was called House of the Rising Sun.  The oldest known existing recording...  Yes.  ...is by an Appalachian artist named Clarence Tom Ashley and Gwen Foster, who recorded it in 1934.  Do we have that?  There's no way we have that, right?  We should.  Or YouTube. 
[00:56:00]  They should have that for the blues...  What is it?  Bluesville?  Ah, they should.  I bet you they have it on Bluesville.  Mm-hmm.  What do you got under House of the Rising Sun in the old system?  You got the Animals.  You got the Bob Dylan.  But then you got to go further back than that.  Joan Baez did a version.  Joan Baez did.  Yeah, which is pretty good.  I love a good cover.  Joan Baez.  I like, like, two or three of her songs.  Yeah.  She does the Diamonds and Rust.  Diamonds and Rust.  Great song.  But Anthony...  Who's this?  Oh, I know.  Joan Baez.  Sorry.  Oh, Joan Baez.  I have the...  Is this it? 
[00:56:30]  1934 version.  Oh.  It's a hell of a voice.  Yeah.  In New Orleans...  Gwen Foster?  They call it the rising sun...  She's got a very Joan Baez-y sound.  Is that...  Yeah.  It's a hell of a voice, though.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  It's a beautiful girl, and me...  Oh, God.  Nice.  My favorite part of Anthony doing that is the warm-up that nobody can see. 
[00:57:30]  Yes, I have to go...  Make sure everything's working properly.  Shooka, shooka.  We found the 1933, was it you said?  1934, Tom Clarence, Ashley, and Gwen Foster.  This is the earliest version of the song that was recorded, even though it goes back by even  before these guys.  1934.  Oh, Ann's going to hate this.  I said 1933.  It's right on the screen.  Lay on the house in New Orleans, they call the rising sun. 
[00:58:00]  It sounds like Lead Belly.  Where many poor boys, their destruction has gone.  And the old boys...  These are some good old boys.  Oh, yeah.  These are some good old boys.  The house next door...  The maid was sold...  These guys are rednecks.  ...a steel, a glaze...  Oh, man. 
[00:58:30]  How many lynchings have these guys been on the musical act at?  I think we found the opening band for a lynching.  Yeah, I think we found the guys that actually stole the song.  They just said, give me that.  Hey, boy.  Give me that.  This is some Deliverance shit right here.  Yeah, not a great version of the song, though.  1933.  Oh, here we go.  Who is it? 
[00:59:00]  Lead Belly?  Yeah, I like this version.  Ann's going to hate this.  What year is this?  Mid-80s, which is really...  Oh, really?  Mid-80s.  Okay.  Oh, no.  This guitar work stinks. 
[00:59:30]  He sounds like...  He ripped off the white man.  Those are white guys, and now he's doing it.  Sounds like the Little Rascals.  Yeah.  Listen to that horrid guitar.  He sucks.  No.  It's just a shitty old guitar.  It probably doesn't even have all the strings.  It's terrible.  He probably had to use a shoelace or something. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, the turtle show was fucking...  Right.  I just...  Right.  You can't say this is good guitar work.  That's a little sloppy.  I actually don't like this.  I think I've heard a different version of Lead Belly's House of the Rising song.  Oh, whatever.  That's not my favorite version, but I do enjoy a little bit.  And then, of course, the Animals made it theirs.  Don't you think?  Is that the best version?  What's the version everybody knows?  The Animals.  That's the one, huh?  Yeah.  I like Dillon's, too, though. 
[01:00:30]  This is...  They made it their own, man.  That's what everybody learns to play on the guitar first.  Their first song.  Is this an easy song to play?  Yeah, it's not hard.  Yeah.  There is...  In New Orleans.  They call the rising sun.  Do they?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  They've been the ruined opinion.  The strippers at Danny's Den when I was growing up, this was a fan favorite. 
[01:01:00]  They would dance this.  So, this always brings a smile on my face.  We were 17, 18, going into Danny's Den, seeing just horrendous strippers.  Horrible-looking strippers.  Now it's a parking lot for a supermarket somewhere in Comac.  They just used this song for the GSP promotion.  Did they really?  In the one-minute promo for him and...  Diaz.  Yeah, Diaz.  It was fucking great.  Really? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, it just got you very pumped for the fight.  It takes balls.  These guys made it their song.  I mean, this is a blues standard.  It goes way the fuck back.  And now we've got to bring it around.  Bob Dylan, 51 years ago, released his version.  Give me a little taste of that, and then we'll finally move on.  I do like his version a lot.  Yeah?  I do, man.  There is a house down in New Orleans. 
[01:02:00]  They call the rising sun.  And it's been...  Of many poor girls.  And me, oh...  God, I'm a one.  Ugh.  No.  No.  No!  I love the anger, though. 
[01:02:30]  Most people are like, ah, it's not bad.  Ah.  But it just brings anger out in you.  Why?  I get so mad.  This was just before the Beatles, too, huh?  Yeah.  That's what Dylan was doing.  Fucking Dylan.  I don't know.  Dylan, one of those guys, he didn't really change his sound when the Beatles said...  No.  ...stayed true to what he was doing.  And then he wound up doing very well for himself over the years.  Yeah, yeah.  Not bad.  Yeah.  That ain't too shabby.  Mm.  What the hell do I know?  I put the record on, I listen, I dance, I go home. 
[01:03:00]  You work it all out.  What the hell do I know?  More anniversaries today.  There's a big one for Jim Norton.  Do you know what else happened today?  Do you hear me?  Um...  It's a biggie in your world.  Is it?  It's a huge one in your world, actually.  What's today's date?  Was it X amount of years ago that Kenison died or somebody died?  I don't know.  Someone died.  Was it Pryor?  Nope.  I don't think so.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Randy Rhodes.  Ah, in 82.  There you go.  31 years ago, right?  That's right.  March of 82.  He would only be 56 if he was still alive. 
[01:03:30]  That's it.  He was a young guy.  He was 25.  Damn.  Doing that flyby, right?  Whoops.  And what did the wing hit the fucking tour bus or something?  That's crazy.  Sharon Seamstress, Rachel Youngblood, was on the plane.  And he didn't even like to fly.  They said Randy didn't like to fly.  They were surprised that he got in that plane.  And they fucking, they just took a little, the bus driver, I think, had a pilot license.  And they would just buzz the tour bus.  And the wing clipped it.  Ozzy was asleep on the bus.  So was Sharon.  That's awesome.  That's pretty fucking stupid. 
[01:04:00]  Why do they go that low with the flyby?  I was showing off.  Yeah, but you could show off being 20 feet above the tour bus.  Man.  That's crazy.  Damn.  What a dumb, what a waste.  Really?  Like, what an avoidable death.  Was he that good, Randy Rhodes?  He was great, man.  He was, fuck yeah, 26.  He was great.  Really great guitarist.  But he was a classical guy.  Ozzy said he would take a lesson in every town.  He'd find one of these old guys and just, he really enjoyed classical guitar. 
[01:04:30]  And he would have left Ozzy probably, you know, before 85 anyway.  Yeah, he was one of those guys.  He was on his own trip.  He said, Ozzy said he didn't want to be a rock star.  Like, he did it and he was fine with it.  But he would have moved on.  Right.  All right.  Yeah, that's a pretty fucking stupid thing to do.  Yeah, man.  I'm not supposed to do that shit.  Crazy.  Gambling was legalized 82 years ago today?  82 years ago?  Where?  In Nevada. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, wow.  Nevada.  And then a man named Mo Green came in.  I never asked why.  Why?  You should have.  That man was Mo Green.  Remember when Jordan left basketball to do baseball?  Uh-huh.  And then he said, fuck baseball and going back to basketball?  Oh, boy.  That was 18 years ago.  No way!  That's crazy!  18 years!  18 years ago, he returned from baseball. 
[01:05:30]  His original retirement was almost 20 years ago?  He retired way fucking too early.  And then took, what, a year or two off, right?  And then came back.  The fuck?  He basically retired in his prime.  He was so bored with the sport.  Oh.  18 years ago, he went back to basketball.  Jesus.  He just turned 50.  No, he wasn't 32 when he left.  That can't be right.  Let's look this shit up, because I think Jimmy might be right.  That can't be right.  He took a couple years off after his dad died. 
[01:06:00]  I don't know.  So what?  He was only 30, 31-ish?  Is that possible?  Where are the sports fans?  Wow.  I always feel like he was a little older, too, Jimmy.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  It's basically in his prime.  He just said, fuck that.  Why would you do that?  Maybe because of what...  I guess he got bored.  Maybe because of what...  What's-his-name was saying yesterday.  What's that?  That he's a genius, and he didn't even realize.  Oh, that it was easy for him.  It was so easy to him. 
[01:06:30]  You know, like Brando.  The Brando thing.  He just got bored with it.  It was so easy, because he's a true genius.  He was 31 when he retired the first time.  31?  Why would you do that?  Yeah, when he moved to baseball.  October 6, 1993.  Right.  To be like Bo Jackson.  He was 31.  Is he alive, Bo Jackson?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It was Kirby Puppet.  Considered the greatest athlete of our century.  Is he really?  Or of the last century.  Athlete.  Well, that century thing's weird, because now we're into the...  New century. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, so it fucks up the whole thing.  Can't even say that.  Or I think they're starting to say he's the greatest athlete of our time now.  Yeah, when you use the century thing now...  It's only 13 years.  You're setting the pole pretty fucking low until something builds up.  Because even evil people, it's like,  Oh, he's the most evil person of the century.  Right.  I think Hitler got that one, you know, last century.  Yeah, he did.  So now it's like, eh.  Yeah.  Eh.  Who do you got, really?  But he was voted, I think, greatest athlete of our generation or something like that. 
[01:07:30]  Of our time.  What's he doing these days?  Vincent Edward Bo Jackson.  I don't know what he's doing now.  What if he played football and baseball at the same time, right?  Yeah.  And Dion did it.  Crazy.  Dion did a little something-something.  Oh, Travis.  But Jordan was stupid to do that.  How tall is Jordan?  Six-six?  That's a ridiculous strike zone.  Strike zone's crazy.  What's he doing?  Why would you do that?  I remember getting a Michael Jordan baseball card, and I was very excited. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, wow.  He wasn't even close to good at it, either.  Didn't he have, like, he finally got a double or something, and everyone got so excited?  I don't remember.  I just remember he wasn't that good.  He was horrendous.  But he was all-in, too, man.  He was on the team bus, and he took it very seriously.  There's a great Bo Jackson 30 for 30.  Is it?  That you should check out.  It's called You Don't Know Bo.  It's very good.  What did he learn about him?  You're reminded of how fast he faded after he got injured. 
[01:08:30]  He was literally the greatest athlete anyone had ever seen, excelling at two sports.  Like, he wasn't just, like, okay at one sport.  He was great at both sports.  I kind of forget now.  Yeah.  I kind of forget his baseball skills.  And he got injured.  What was his injury?  It was a hamstring, I think.  He was very injured.  And he never really came back from it.  Never really came back.  So then what happened to him?  He came back, but he wasn't what he used to be.  And then he faded quick.  He just kind of faded, yeah.  So what is he doing?  I think he's coaching and teaching. 
[01:09:00]  I forget.  He still has money?  No.  Probably not a lot.  Well, you endorsements.  I mean, yeah, but I mean, you got to remember, like, even when he played, like, those massive  contracts weren't around yet.  How many years did he play?  Bo Jackson makes custom arrows?  Wait a minute.  What?  Hold on a minute.  What?  What happens to these people?  Let's go to Mark in North Carolina.  Mark.  Hey, how you guys doing?  How do you know that he makes custom arrows? 
[01:09:30]  I saw a documentary on him a while ago, and he just likes to go down to his barn, and  he just makes these custom arrows, you know, with the ends and stuff.  I mean, it's just like a hobby for him.  Would you buy a custom arrow from Bo Jackson?  I don't know.  I don't know that.  That's what he's doing.  And I kind of forgot.  Did Jordan officially get suspended for gambling from the NBA?  Oh, you're asking me?  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  I don't remember.  I don't follow basketball, so I'm not the guy to ask about that kind of stuff.  Or were they on his trail, and that's when he did?  Go ahead, Jim.  Fill us in, please.  Well, I mean.  Oh.  So, he was implicated in gambling.  He had loads of debt.  They came after him and killed his dad.  They were going to snitch on him to the league, and then the league was going to get blasted.  So, Stern said, you're going to take a secret suspension.  Two years.  Went and played baseball.  Two years later, he came back, and the sport was dying.  They needed him. 
[01:10:30]  They brought him back.  Do you think his dad, that's a big rumor.  That his father was killed for that reason.  Conspiracy theories, of course.  I don't know.  I'm not a big conspiracy guy, so I would probably say no.  Didn't he have enough money to, you know, pay those guys to act?  You would think he was the greatest basketball player of all time.  Yeah.  Hey, look up Bill Simmons, the sports guy.  Talked all about it.  Sports guy.  You think it was a secret suspension, though?  It was secret, but.  Where Stern said, look, you got to just fucking fade away for a little bit.  You got to fade away for a little bit. 
[01:11:00]  Ooh, bobbin'.  All right.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Yeah, Bo Jackson, the injury, he dislocated his hip from his pelvis.  Holy fuck.  That's a rough injury.  How'd he do that?  Playing sports.  Oh, I assumed it was something in the library.  Reaching for a book.  I agree.  There was a great, like, you know, just, like, lists of terrible injuries that sports figures get, 
[01:11:30]  like, you know, falling down the stairs or, you know, playing with your dog and just getting injured.  Or how about Theismann's prostate?  That's a hell of an issue.  Enough with your fucking prostate.  Well, do you know how Joe hurt his leg?  How?  He was reaching for a book.  You mean liability.  You mean the worst way to injure yourself?  How embarrassing.  You have your chair teeters at the library?  Do we know how he hurt himself?  Can we find that? 
[01:12:00]  Well, John in Mobile, Alabama knows all about Bo Jackson.  John, you're on.  Let's do this.  Hey, I went to Auburn, and I was a senior when Bo was a freshman.  Mary is our house in New Orleans.  That's what this guy sounds exactly like.  Yeah, turn yourself back to 78.  Go ahead, John.  I grew up in Miami, so...  No one cares.  Like E-Rock.  I know.  But Bo's injury was a hereditary thing. 
[01:12:30]  Kind of like dogs have that hip dysplasia thing.  That's what happened to him.  It kind of degenerated.  Oh, wow.  So he just kind of had it.  How many years did he play professionally?  One.  Three or four.  But he did have a hip replacement, and he came back and played a couple of years after.  Wow.  The hip replacement.  That's crazy.  He came back.  His first at-bat was a home run.  Really?  Just Bo Jackson.  How many years did he play? 
[01:13:00]  Maybe...  Oh, no.  Less than ten.  Four.  That's all he did.  Played for the Raiders for four years.  Right.  Played for...  Played in baseball for...  A little longer, right?  Eight years, but he took some time.  So that's it for Bo Jackson?  That was his whole career?  Yeah, four...  Four and eight.  Seven years.  In high school, he was a basketball star, too.  Jesus.  He was awesome.  When he was in Auburn, they let him dress out for one game, and he played, and he had 
[01:13:30]  six dunks when he played for Auburn, and Pat Nye, the football coach, heard he was playing  basketball, ran down there and pulled his ass out of the game and said, you're not playing  basketball anymore, son.  Wow, really?  All right, John.  Thank you.  Really terrific stuff.  Thank you, John.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff.  Thank you, John.  You did a great interview.  Bo Jackson?  I would love to talk to Bo Jackson.  Yeah, why isn't he, like, out there?  Why isn't he, like, writing books and shit like that?  He's making his arrows.  Oh.  That one guy. 
[01:14:00]  He's custom arrows.  That probably takes up a lot of time.  You've got to make sure that shit flies right.  That's true.  You don't want an arrow that's all willy-nilly.  Got to fly straight.  How do you fly him straight?  Straight as an arrow.  How do you do that?  With a straight shaft.  Yeah, but how do you make the shaft straight?  You have to have a straight shaft.  You've got to make sure your shaft is straight.  But how do you do that?  I don't know.  They use carbon fiber now.  I think you just buy fucking a little shitload of stock.  But is there like-  And you've got your tips, your fucking razor tips, and then you've got your flights, your  feathers.  Well, what if you have a dud shaft? 
[01:14:30]  If you've got a dud shaft-  But how do you know?  Is there a tool where you go, all right, here's my shaft.  I've got to make sure it's straight.  I bet you hold it up to your eye, and you spin it.  Old school?  Oh.  Really?  That's it?  Yeah, it's probably a very hands-on, very, you know, not mechanized way of-  You think some asshole goes through a lot of shafts because he's pissed off that he didn't  find a perfectly straight one?  Yeah, yeah.  With his custom arrows?  Like, fuck, man.  I can't find a straight shaft.  Just a pile of shafts that have to go back to the factory? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yep-ers.  Well, we've got a terrific bit about Anthony that's about to be played.  What happened here?  Well, you're going to find out, sir.  Uh-oh.  From the makers of Jenna Loves Brianna and Janine Loves Jenna, comes the next feature  to make all your wet dreams a reality.  SS Adult Films presents the greatest fuckfest of the century.  Fuckfest.  Go-go.  But I just feel like, you know, as men, we've been down this road before. 
[01:15:30]  Loves.  Oh.  Anthony.  I've gotten better handjobs from my sister.  Radio star Anthony Cumia's first gay experience is caught on tape.  For your jacking pleasure.  Ah, it's going to get bad in here.  Inhibitions are forgotten, as Anthony finally does all the things his dad told him were so  naughty.  This is like what happens in prison.  Go-go loves Anthony fills you up with romance.  Well, normally I like a couple fingers up my ass. 
[01:16:00]  Fun.  Can you turn your head and cough?  And freaky gay sex cum.  Holy shit!  Oh my god!  With commentary from cock connoisseur Jim Norton.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity for Valentine's Day.  And featuring a special appearance from Andrew Dice Clay.  You know, you'll have ass fucking in here, but I can't light a fucking cigarette.  He'd never thought he'd do it.  But watch Anthony diving in for his second helping of man meat. 
[01:16:30]  I'm like a fucking baby seal on an ice float that just took a mallet over the head.  I thought you were in it to win it.  Not gay.  Not anymore, Kumia.  You got a dick, you know it feels good.  Go-go loves Anthony.  Available now at the gayest stores ever.  I think the gayness is plausible.  Jesus.  Very good.  I think I was taken out of context there.  What happened?  Not really.  No.  That's what you said to me.  Man, we were all here.  We all heard it. 
[01:17:00]  And that happened.  Fucking cocksucker.  Oh, Jesus.  Chippa.  It's a bit.  It sure is.  God.  It's all fucking.  I take it very personally.  Is that gay in the show?  Is that gay in the show up?  I don't think so.  I think we've been pretty good so far, right?  Yeah.  We have stayed away from the gay pretty well.  Yeah, I think we've done all right.  Thank goodness.  Yes.  Yeah, we got E-Rock all drunk on tequila and not one gay thing happened. 
[01:17:30]  That's true.  I wonder how far we could have gotten him to go.  He would have had sex.  Something up his ass, I'm sure.  E-Rock, any updates on the tequila donut show?  Anything else?  No, not really.  No?  Well, your brother heard the show for the first time yesterday.  Yes.  And he's encouraging me to drink more.  Oh, really?  Really?  He likes that version of you, huh?  Yeah.  He said I'm too uptight.  You're too uptight. 
[01:18:00]  Well, I can't disagree with him.  Yeah, you were so much funner when you were all fucked up.  I know, right?  Just blubbering.  Fucking weepy.  Are you planning another theme show?  Because that's what a lot of people are asking me.  When is the next E-Rock theme show with the big surprise?  You got any ideas, maybe?  You don't have to tell us what they are.  No, not yet.  Not yet?  Not yet.  Vodka and breakfast burritos.  Ooh.  Sounds good.  We still have the Scott and Todd audio?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  What is that?  Huh?  It's on the side there, yeah.  Where?  I don't have it. 
[01:18:30]  It was with the turned over stuff over on the table there.  Do you want to play the Scott and Todd audio?  I would love to hear this because apparently they, what, they talk about Scott?  Yeah.  What you were finding out over the years through Jocktober is that they've had less and less  tolerance for dealing with Scott on the show.  Right.  And this audio kind of shows that they just don't even acknowledge when he chimes in anymore.  And also, I see a little bonus track here.  I don't want to give it away.  Boner track.  A little bonus track from Scott and Todd.  And this audio was the companion piece to the forgotten E-Rock segment that happened 
[01:19:00]  directly before here.  Well, that's why I'm bringing it up.  We were supposed to play this Friday.  We never got to it.  So I think we need to kind of play it to...  Tie up the loose ends?  Yes.  Exactly.  Scott called out for lying about an article about their show.  What?  Scott said, hey, we got an article featuring us in the newspaper.  Right.  And it turns out it really wasn't an article about them. 
[01:19:30]  It was just they mentioned their name and that was about it.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, so the other guys made fun of them?  Yeah, they're making fun of them.  For making more of it than it is?  Exactly.  Okay.  By the way, they got a nice little piece about it today in the New York Daily News.  David Hinckley, the number one TV critic in America, comes up with this and they talk  about the problems that some of these shows that are on in the daytime, they have audiences  that are too old. 
[01:20:00]  They call them the Grey Bunch.  Oh.  You know, like, you got people who watch the median ages up around 50, 52 years.  Why is he doing this?  The median ages.  They don't know either.  He doesn't understand he sounds old as dirt.  I got dentures in my mouth.  What is he talking about?  He's trying to make believe that he's not talking to old people?  Is that Scott or Todd?  That's Scott.  Scott.  That's Scott.  Oh, I think that's Todd.  Oh, boy.  He used to have a radio voice.  That's awful.  You got people who watch the median ages up around 50, 52 years old, and that's not 
[01:20:30]  what the advertisers look like want in TV in the afternoon.  The show with the youngest median viewer age is our show, Dish Nation, right at the top  of the hit parade.  Pretty amazing.  Not really an article about us.  Well, Scott is right here.  Scott and Todd from PLJ 95.5.  Right.  Not really an article about us.  She said he wrote a nice article about us.  He mentioned this. 
[01:21:00]  I kind of like this.  They're really good at him.  He's trying to make it sound like there's a big, huge article on their show, and it's  just a mention.  We're mentioning a bunch of those radio fucking columns.  Don't say that.  It's like being written about, like you're being written about.  We were mentioned, which is nice.  Todd won't give him an inch.  No, I love it.  I kind of like this.  She said he wrote a nice article about us.  But he mentioned us.  Because he couldn't avoid it. 
[01:21:30]  Because we work in his city, and we're on the number one show of the youngest people.  Well, don't you think I framed it up nice?  Yeah.  And it's not a compliment.  I think if it's late in your life, you ought to try to go a little more down the honest  road.  Start making amends with the man upstairs.  You know, he's going to say, you know what I'm saying?  Scott, I let you in here, but I tell you what, I listened in there one morning, and you said  David Hinkley wrote a whole story about you.  You only got a mention.  You know what I mean?  Let's start making peace with you.  We got two mentions.  Right here and right there.  See, Scott thinks he's back in the radio days where there was no inner words. 
[01:22:00]  Right, where no one could check anything.  They're like this.  Ah, must be a big article.  I've got to go out and get the paper.  I'm sorry.  I've got a nine-hour drive to the store.  The radio man says it's in there.  The radio man says they're in the paper.  I feel like I'm listening to two guys that don't have teeth.  That are really fucked up on, like, moonshine or something.  That's terrible.  They seem really fucked up.  Why are they talking like that?  I don't know.  Scott doesn't sound that great either. 
[01:22:30]  They talk like that.  Maybe he's imitating Scott.  He just doesn't realize it after all these years.  Because they do kind of sound alike.  They really sound like they have fucking no teeth, huh?  Do you think they like each other?  No, no.  How long have they been together?  25 years?  That's probably about right, I would guess.  22, yeah.  They're cornwalls.  And, Iraq, you said they hated each other, right?  Oh, yeah.  I used to see it.  Oh, you were there?  During the breaks, one would go to the office, the other one would stay in the studio,  and then they only talked when the mics were on. 
[01:23:00]  Scott tries to contribute, gets ignored twice.  What's a hemistorical?  Isn't that when a lady's got a problem in the hair and they've got to take it out?  That's what it is.  You've got to have a hemistorical?  That's right.  I think it's distracting me.  All right.  That's close enough.  I had the right number of syllables.  How about Dennis going, you're going to see me in the book for you?  Oh, you just missed it.  It sounds like, that's what I'm saying.  No teeth.  What did you say, Iraq?  Well, Ant had...  Oh, sorry.  I stepped on it.  I stepped on it.  But they just, Scott contributes something and they don't respond. 
[01:23:30]  They keep going with the conversation.  Oh, really?  And you hear Scott come in again and they just plow right over like he never said anything.  I think it's distracting me.  All right.  That's close enough.  I had the right number of syllables.  How about Dennis going, you're going to see me in the bookmobile?  He doesn't even know names.  I'm going to meet those guys out there.  I'm going to meet the guys in there.  I'll hopefully shake some hands.  Then I'll meet God.  He lives in there.  I'll be right up in there doing my thing.  What is this thing that he does? 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to be doing it.  I'm going to be doing my thing up there.  Hopefully you'll see.  I don't even know what I'm listening to.  I don't know what's going on.  You're right.  I don't even know what I'm listening to.  You sound the same.  It's two shows going on at the same time.  Two different shows being broadcast at the same time.  Who enjoys that?  I don't know.  Hey, my teeth fell out.  Sure they're mine.  My teeth fell out too.  I can't believe we're doing a radio show.  But we've got no teeth.  A terrible improv that was.  Oh, yeah.  And then he said the silence. 
[01:24:30]  He's awful.  He said it twice.  Yeah, and they just don't acknowledge that he's talking in their conversation.  He's fucking horrid.  He makes between two and four million dollars a year.  It just sucks to do that.  He's terrible.  To do that.  Man, a pulp will be.  It's going to be a pulp in the middle.  Fucking boo.  Just taking up seats in New York radio.  God.  Holy fuck.  Do they like them on the New York radio message board?  Do they think they're good radio guys?  I can't imagine.  I don't know.  I haven't been to that site in years. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, it's been quite a while.  A long, long time.  I have no idea what they would think of these guys.  And he says he's going back to South Korea.  Oh, they're going on vacation.  He's going over there for vacation.  They're going to hang out.  Him and Kim Jong-un.  Maybe they get a little tent in one of those Coleman campers.  You never know, man.  You and Dennis reminds me of Scott Shannon.  Why?  They're both full of it.  All right.  6-15.  They were having a discussion and Scott decided to cut it off because they were making fun 
[01:25:30]  of them.  He hit the bed there.  I've had enough of you guys making fun of me.  I had a good Colbert stove improv.  I said, I'm going to go camp.  I'm going to get a Colbert stove.  I said, I'm going to get a little tent in a Colbert stove. 
[01:26:00]  Colbert stove, bitch.  Who does he think laughs at that?  He said tent in a Colbert stove.  It's hilarious.  Fucking guy's good.  I said, Chippa likes it.  Fucking love Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  But I don't even know what I'm listening to.  It's bizarre.  Yeah, that's fucking awful.  Remember I said we had a bonus track.  Boner.  Yes.  Song parody.  Oh, nice.  Song parody.  What is this one about?  Dennis Rodman.  Oh.  And Kim Jong-un. 
[01:26:30]  Do they laugh in the middle of it?  They played this four times.  They love it.  They played it four times on one show.  They love this.  Yeah, once an hour.  Do you hear them laughing?  No, this is from the first play before we're even on.  Oh, really?  Do you want to hear this?  Oh, fuck.  What song did they do to it?  I don't even remember now.  Oh, Little Mermaid.  Little Mermaid?  Kim Jong-un and Dennis Rodman have become the best of friends. 
[01:27:00]  I'm too hard already.  Become.  Have become the best.  It's become.  Not become.  Become is fucking what comes out of a bee's dick.  Yeah.  That's what honey is.  It's become on a fucking sandwich.  A fucking shoehorn right away.  Yeah.  The friends.  They want to go on vacation.  And both get a cold and cleanse.  They like to take strolls on the beach.  Play basketball and drink booze.  Have a massage with Mago Peach. 
[01:27:30]  And go get matching tattoos.  They're crazy doos.  In bizarre news.  Oh.  Bizarre.  One is a leader.  The other is a breeder.  Man, what a pair.  Will they sleep in a king-sized bed?  At the North Korean club, man.  The North Korean club.  You're just jamming.  Jamming.  Jamming words in.  How about.  What?  What's wrong with that?  It's so bad.  One wishes he was bigger. 
[01:28:00]  The others.  I'd respect them more for that.  They've been a king-sized bed.  At the North Korean club, man.  Keep drunk and dead.  Let's play doubles tennis till they turn red.  Oh.  What?  Oh, yeah.  How they became the best of buds is a total mystery.  Best of buds.  Their difference in heights no matter.  They say they both stand to pee.  And when the guys go out to eat. 
[01:28:30]  They split mozzarella sticks.  They use Instagram and they tweet.  A couple of lunatics.  They're crazy dudes.  In bizarre moods.  Hey, hey, hey.  One is a leader.  The other is a breeder.  Man, what a pair.  Oh, my God.  Will they sleep in a king-sized bed?  At the North Korean club, man.  Kim Jong and Dan is a total man.  And it's these guys should win.  Oh.  Wow.  I hate that.  What is that? 
[01:29:00]  What is that?  It's fun, Jim.  Who the fuck?  It's fun sounds.  2013.  They play that four times.  Four times?  Every hour.  You think they get requests for it?  Hi.  Could you play?  Not one.  Not one.  Not a one?  No.  God, I stink.  Yeah, terrible.  That's what radio has to offer.  That's what people listen to.  Yeah, this business is filled with people.  They just get their seats and it's almost impossible to get rid of them.  Wow.  For whatever reason. 
[01:29:30]  Because maybe name recognition.  I don't know.  I don't know, man.  Who the fuck would listen to any of that stuff and enjoy it on the way to work?  I am a breeder.  I am a fucking shit.  Shut up.  It's annoying, right?  It's terrible.  The North Korean comment.  The jamming of words into a line.  Just corny.  And they're on that Dish Nation that they're promoting the fuck out of on TV.  What drips.  What fucking.  And they're on the TV. 
[01:30:00]  You know how depressing it is?  Scott and Todd are on TV.  We can't get a wall knocked down.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Can't even get a wall knocked down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are we at with the wall?  Anything?  Oh, there's never going to be any solution to that.  It's over.  That's fucking case closed.  That's it.  I lost an arm on my chair today.  I'm sure that'll never be fixed.  What'll happen?  Everything just is fucking rusting and rotting.  It's our eyes.  No one gives a fuck.  It's just falling apart.  One thing I like in the studio is my dumb chair. 
[01:30:30]  I come in here a little early and just watch TV and read about quickly three or four newspapers  and the armrest is gone.  No one gives a fuck.  That happened.  I wonder.  I don't even know.  We could do a Kickstarter to see if we can raise the four to five hundred thousand dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To knock the wall down.  Great idea.  I don't know.  But Jimmy's right.  I think Jimmy said last week, we've gone as far as we can with this company.  I mean, we're in a contract and all that, but we really got to figure this shit out because  it's so obvious nothing is going to get better here. 
[01:31:00]  It's sludge, man.  It's not even, I like, I like being here.  It's just, it's, it's, it's just fucking sludge.  Here we go.  Are we in the mud?  Yeah.  The only way to get shit done is to say to the representatives, this is what I'm doing.  That's why Louie's smart, because he doesn't ask his manager for shit.  Right.  He says, hook this meeting up.  You know, we've been talking about a bus tour for, we're closing in on a year and I know  it'll not happen.  I'm not planning for it because now, you know, being, having two kids at home, I got to fucking 
[01:31:30]  plan for that.  I can't just leave for a week.  I got to figure shit out.  I haven't even started figuring that shit out because I just know I'm not going to waste  my time knowing it's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  Well, they came for one date that I couldn't do.  So hopefully, they say maybe in June or something.  No, I said we're not doing it in June.  Well, maybe I'm just saying that.  No, we're not doing it in the summer.  They already told them they had plenty of time to figure this out.  This was supposed to be...  You're talking about middlemen.  Now we're pitching again.  I'm sorry.  It was supposed to be early spring, late spring tops. 
[01:32:00]  And they hit us up with, well, maybe June.  I'm like, no, we're not doing it in the summer.  Because I'm going to go enjoy my summer.  That's why.  I'm not available.  Going to go do some things, finally.  Fuck this place.  Not waiting for them anymore.  They had plenty of time.  It's now mid-March and there's no plans.  It was supposed to be early April, originally.  That's two weeks away.  I think it's going to be middle May now.  That's the best shot they got.  It ain't happening. 
[01:32:30]  I'm telling you right now, it's not happening.  It's not happening.  It ain't happening, man.  Maybe they just...  Because of all the sludge and mud, they just can't figure out how to get things done around  here.  They just can't figure it out.  Is the James Lipton clip up on the website from yesterday?  No.  And nobody...  I didn't know where...  Nobody asked me for the video.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  James Lipton talked about something he's never talked about before.  We got video of it.  Did we really not put that up on the website?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I didn't give the video to anybody, so... 
[01:33:00]  Didn't we say yesterday we needed that up ASAP?  Because that's like...  I asked Travis about it.  Did he...  Maybe he contacted them and they didn't...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't...  I didn't give the video to anybody.  What does the Radio Wizard do?  Same shit.  I guess he, um...  But he should be overseeing this.  He should be overseeing all this.  He talked about something he never spoke about publicly. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  And I'm not saying that that's...  And he even went, oh, you're going there.  Oh, boy.  But it's just something.  It's just the idea.  It was very dramatic, how it came out.  That is why...  Oh, jeez.  We go fucking...  But that's why fucking Stern is in...  He's in the mix for everything because his fucking PR people are really smart.  Yeah.  They're right there.  They're fucking smart.  And we got, um...  Wow.  Why isn't it up? 
[01:34:00]  I want to know.  Well, we're not...  We have to be more proactive with that shit, too, because by relying on these people,  we're basically saying, you do it, and we don't want to do it.  We can't delegate responsibility to anybody.  Yeah, I thought that clip, because I remember the second he left the studio, Jimmy said...  I don't even know who you were talking to, but I remember you saying...  It might have been Travis or Gary.  I don't remember.  Saying, oh, we need to get that video clip.  Up and out immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  I don't...  I can't wrap my fuck...  I literally...  It's like... 
[01:34:30]  I feel like this is a fucking...  I'm being punked.  With how fucking shitty things are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fucking shit.  What?  Do we have an answer?  Of course not.  Why would...  Well, no, we were going to...  But I was not...  But now, everybody...  We never have an answer.  What's going on?  The audio got sent to PR at 10...  But the audio is not...  That's great.  I figured the audio is good. 
[01:35:00]  But the video is what you really need, because that's what goes up on...  Again, I don't necessarily be on TMZ.  But that's fucking...  Right.  The video...  Better to have.  Yeah, you see him.  You see him talking about it.  It's a very visual age we're living in.  We're complaining that we don't have any fucking visual element.  And then we have...  That's why Sam does it videotape.  Right.  For what?  I like to have copies of it.  That's not the only way I think I just want to look at myself.  It's fucking frustrating.  I'm sorry to yell, man, but it's goddammit! 
[01:35:30]  Sorry, I don't mean to laugh.  No, but it's like, why even give a fuck?  You have to laugh.  You have to just laugh.  Because it's just so ridiculous at this point.  And I'm not blaming our guys.  We have a guy they gave to us to oversee this channel.  So he should be constantly walking around with a clipboard and just checking things off.  What did the guys do today?  What should we farm out?  That should have been...  Yeah.  Radio...  I don't blame Travis.  I don't blame anyone on our staff. 
[01:36:00]  Sorry.  I just don't.  Someone?  Fucking radio...  It's up to him.  He was the one that was given to us.  I didn't want him.  I never wanted the fucking guy.  Because he had no skills and no resume to run a show like this.  He comes from a music background.  He is a nice guy and he knows music programming.  I never wanted him.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  But with that said, he should have enough brains to walk around constantly going, okay, how do we push this show forward?  Oh, you had James Lipton in. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, first of all, you got to listen to every show we do.  I don't even think he does that.  But then he's got to go, wow, I heard James Lipton talking about something he's never talked about before.  Oh, my God, I got to go right to Sam because I know Sam videotapes all the interviews and I got to get that fucking piece of tape immediately.  And then I got to go upstairs and give it to the PR department.  None of that ever happens.  None of it.  But we rely too heavily on people that we know aren't going to do what we need them to do.  It's almost like with my manager, I got so frustrated.  I finally said, this is what I want to do.  I want to shoot something. 
[01:37:00]  I couldn't wait for other people anymore.  And sometimes, you know, waiting for other people, they're not going to do it.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not going to fucking do it.  Well, and they don't do it.  No.  What's the last clip on our, on our, uh.  Yeah, what is the last clip?  On our website.  The web fucking department for this fucking.  Let's see what the last clip is.  David Lee Roth, all right.  David Lee Roth.  They're all.  Hammond.  Uh-huh.  But see.  Look at all the fucking heat that David Lee Roth thing got. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with anybody here.  Of course not.  It was an audio clip and then they stole it.  He stole someone's Instagram picture and put it up on a Van Halen blog.  But two weeks they'll come and they'll go, you got that David Lee Roth video?  Well, then there's emails going around like sort of, uh, kind of taking credit, sort of.  Kind of keeping it very vague and living in that gray area.  Right.  But they had nothing to do with all that press we got the, uh, last week.  Nothing.  That was a fan of Van Halen that happens to be a fan of our show that grabbed the clip and grabbed an Instagram picture. 
[01:38:00]  That's, that's how that worked out.  That wasn't because the PR department here pushed that out.  Which they should have.  You know.  Never going to.  You know, Gary should have pushed that out.  He's never going to.  Yeah.  They're never going to.  Oh, God.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  I don't know why I give a fuck anymore.  I really shouldn't eating blueberries.  Well, because we give a, we give a fuck about ourselves. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  We have, we still have the passion.  They don't.  These guys have jobs.  They don't give a fuck.  We're so fucking down on the priority scale in this place.  Yeah, we know that.  It's like, it's almost like it's got to be a self-preservation thing.  Like, I, I know that about, I try relying on fucking other people to do something.  Uh, professionally.  And I realize other people don't give a fuck.  And they don't.  No, no one cares.  So I just, fuck it.  I'll do my own thing.  You're right.  Fuck everybody.  Yeah.  Uh-huh. 
[01:39:00]  Jeez.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see who takes the, uh, the rap for this one.  No one.  No one.  Oh, but we didn't get the, but then the, no, somebody, see the web guy, the this, the,  there'll be 20 people pointing fingers at 20 other people.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Travis is coming down the hall.  He's zipping up his hoodie. 
[01:39:30]  Hmm.  Okay.  He'll, he'll let us know.  Hope he's not cold.  Uh-oh.  Slow walk.  Slow walk.  Oh, he's pissed.  Travis.  I got nothing to add.  Oh, oh.  You're just coming in.  How come our video didn't go out?  What happened?  I've never been involved in, in any video aspect.  Uh, immediately after the show, I sent the PR department the audio.  I explained very clearly in the email that he had never spoken about this before. 
[01:40:00]  Did they get it back to you, at least?  Awesome.  Thanks.  Oh, that's what they said.  Hmm?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Not like, we'll get on this.  Yeah.  It's so easy to upload a video.  So, at the very least, they should be doing that on a regular.  It should never take more than a day.  I don't even want to give them a day.  It shouldn't take more than, you know, between the time we go off the air and five o'clock.  It should be up in seven hours.  Tops. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I mean, with the David Lee Roth thing, like, I know Eric sent them a lot.  Of stuff.  And none of it got out there.  Well, it did eventually.  Well, the audio got out there.  The audio got out there from a different...  Yeah.  We should have the software.  Video should be able to be uploaded in however long it physically takes to upload it.  Mm-hmm.  Depending on the video.  We should be able to have it online by the end of the show.  I mean, if that's a physical...  More or less an hour.  Two hours tops.  It's no reason.  I don't disagree.  There's no reason.  I don't disagree. 
[01:41:00]  There's absolutely zero reason.  Because you're right.  I mean, you know, we are relying on a department that, you know, services the entire company.  You know?  Yes.  Yes, we are.  So, even though we should have some sort of priority.  But our guy should be pushing our shit to the top.  That's what a good...  That's what a guy that knows what the fuck he's doing, you know, could accomplish.  And that guy is, you know, the radio wizard.  He should be pushing.  He should be outside their doors, like, being a pain in the ass. 
[01:41:30]  Like, look, I know you're busy, but this is really important.  We've got to push this forward.  Yeah, he's the guy that's got to go to the other departments, whatever's got to be dealt with.  The liaison.  Right.  As a matter of fact.  Right.  I don't know.  I want to get done.  Whatever.  Great.  I won't see that old codger talking about his days as a fucking pimp.  Yeah, what did that mean by him?  He was very...  He knew how to talk around that.  But basically, was he getting guys laid, or were the guys just watching the sex shows? 
[01:42:00]  I have no idea what that's all about.  I was going to...  Yeah, I wanted to know, like...  We were trying to show...  We were kind of backing off a little bit.  We were trying to show him a little respect, but what was his actual job?  What did the girls do?  Well, the girls did sex acts, obviously, and then you as a tourist got to check it out.  And that was, like, his chick.  But they were just friends.  He watched his chick fucking other guys?  Yeah, he got a little taste, I think, but...  Oh, so weird.  But was...  And then would he step in and do the sex act? 
[01:42:30]  I think he said no.  Well, of course not.  He wasn't part of it.  I asked him if he would have sex, too, and he said no.  He did say no, right?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Quite the conundrum.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we have a...  Oh, boy.  We have a problem with the middle management guys.  We're better off just doing it ourselves.  Of course. 
[01:43:00]  Then they won't let us.  Then that's a problem.  If you look at, like, the view counts that Sirius's YouTube channel gets, like, our David  Lee Roth video has 16,000 views, and then everything else is, like, 900, 100.  Oh, God.  125, 400.  Dude, I do goofy videos, and they get way more views.  Like, what is wrong with these people?  They don't even know how to run it properly and promote it.  My videos, I'll be the first to admit, are goofy things half the time. 
[01:43:30]  And what, these things only get 900 views?  Really?  Clive Davis on Bruce Springsteen, 290 views.  Not 1,000.  No.  290 in six days.  So, as a company, wouldn't they see this and go, wow, you know, we're missing a great  opportunity here.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That will never change.  It's amazing.  I think video's kind of important nowadays.  No matter what you do, it's taken off.  It's a companion piece for everybody. 
[01:44:00]  Everybody is pushing their shit on YouTube and everything as little extras or whatever  it is.  How many views do some of these have?  Wait, yeah, run down the views on some of the big videos on SiriusXM's website.  Whoa.  And no one thinks this is an issue with the company.  Grover Norquist.  What?  Has three videos.  Who is he, though?  I want the big ones.  I want the videos where people would go, Jeff Gordon. 
[01:44:30]  All right, Jeff Gordon.  2,100 views.  That's it.  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  He's pretty big.  5,300.  No.  A Bon Jovi video only did 5,300 views?  Yeah, but it's only been two weeks.  Oh, look at this.  Al Gore commenting on the Al Jazeera stuff.  That's a big story.  The current TV and everything.  Of course it is.  185 views.  1,000 views?  1,000.  1,800.  1,800 views?  1,800 views.  1,800 views.  1,800 views.  It is absolute.  That's embarrassing. 
[01:45:00]  An absolute lack of passion.  It is an absolute mailing it in job.  Our listeners make videos that do better than that.  Oh, yeah.  And they don't even have an audience.  They don't even have an audience where they can even push their videos.  Stupid dog videos have more than these.  What I'm just saying.  Oh, well, the dog videos, they're great.  Don't get me started on the kittens.  Who else?  Maybe we should just put kittens on our videos.  Kitten videos.  Look at this.  Jeff Foxworthy and Guy Fieri.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  Those are two big names.  722 views.  That's unbelievable.  Is that the one where Guy Fieri shoves vodka down his throat?  Is that it?  You're getting confused.  Is that his gimmick?  Oh, man.  Drew Brees on Sean Payton's return.  This was right around Super Bowl time.  Right.  241 views.  Wow.  That was pretty good.  It's getting some traction.  This is embarrassing.  This is embarrassing.  This is really embarrassing. 
[01:46:00]  It is.  This is a huge media company.  It is fucking...  If you cannot see, in these videos with this view count, the absolute utter incompetence with  getting the word out there.  And the lack of give the shit.  It's almost like they're trying to keep it a secret.  Don't tell anyone.  How many does Kiss have?  2,100 views.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Oh, look at this.  Taylor Swift.  Oh.  One of the biggest pop stars.  You can't get any bigger than Taylor Swift right now.  Yeah.  2,000. 
[01:46:30]  2,000 views.  She came through here.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wow.  Jane Fonda on working with her father and Catherine Hepburn.  Mm-hmm.  570 views.  You've got to go back to the Taylor Swift.  She farts and they retweet her 10,000 times.  It's unbelievable.  My face up there.  She farts.  Look at how popular inside the actor's studio is.  Yeah.  Look at those interviews.  It's in 19 countries, he said?  Yeah.  Or is it 70 countries?  Well, that's a big difference.  Is it 19 or 70?  I bet.  I know.  19 seasons.  No, you're right. 
[01:47:00]  It's like 50 countries or some shit?  Yeah, I think it's way up there in the country total.  This is an utter and absolute lack of fucking passion and a lack of direction.  It's embarrassingly fucking bad.  You know, the company's philosophy was very simple.  They hired Howard and everyone just jumped on his back and said, look, that's all we need.  That's what they decided.  But he's smart.  And eventually...  This fucking guy's getting his shit out there.  He's got PR people that know what they're doing.  That's what he's mentioned in every fucking article.  It's smart. 
[01:47:30]  But eventually the guy's going to leave and then what do you got?  What do you got left?  Yeah, you're not building a farm system.  You're not pushing these other revenue streams or ways of getting the content.  You've got access to these massive celebrities.  You're taking video and no one's watching these videos.  Wow.  And we do goofy videos on the side that do way better.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:48:00]  I mean, goofy, dumb shit.  What was Taylor Swift doing in that video?  Maybe it wasn't interesting.  I got a video of just ship in the bathroom.  That's it.  50,000 views.  Like it was nothing.  Chip is a big one.  That's fucking nothing.  Most of my videos do like 11, 12, fucking million.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, sure.  Well, actually, my chip video was up on WorldStarHipHop.  There you go.  Right.  Because them niggas think chip crazy. 
[01:48:30]  My fucking music videos do a lot, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking sick puppies and stuff.  You guys know.  But they have a whole platform to promote this shit.  They don't know how to do it.  It's utter incompetence.  Utter incompetence.  Across the platform, you could be having little promos about the videos.  Mm-hmm.  I have a fucking vitriolic hatred for people who don't do their job.  It makes me so fucking sick to my stomach.  Because it's like, you know, I yelled at my manager recently.  I'm like, nobody has to tell me to go to the radio show in the morning. 
[01:49:00]  My fucking job.  Nobody calls me and goes, hey, Jim, you going to work on some material?  Jim, this is my fucking job.  Right.  I'm not doing anybody a favor when I work on materials.  It's my fucking job.  Do you know what?  It's like, I'm not a fucking great guy for doing that.  That's what my living is.  That's what I'm paid to fucking do.  You're supposed to do.  People, it's like they don't do what they're supposed to do.  And then when they do what they're supposed to do, they expect like a fucking, ah, good. 
[01:49:30]  A parade or something.  How was that, huh?  I fucking hate people that don't do their jobs.  Or at least make an honest effort.  That's sad.  It's fucking sickening.  What, um, is there any other videos?  Carol Burnett show cast reuniting.  Right.  That was a huge deal.  2,100.  Why would it have more than that?  2,100.  All right.  That's terrific.  Chris Rock. 
[01:50:00]  How did the Chris Rock videos do?  I see who Chris Rock did.  Chris Rock.  3,800.  All right.  Holy shit.  Kevin Hart, biggest comedian there is.  Right?  He was on SNL.  He came through here.  3,200.  Yeah, that, that shit, right there.  3,200.  He's the audience you're looking for, dummies.  He's the fucking hottest comic.  How many have, like, 5 million Twitter followers?  No, it's over 6 million.  Over 6 million?  Over 6 million.  He sold out the garden twice in a night.  And an interview with him gets 3,000 views.  And a lot of these pop culture stars, you know, stars, they do a little video on the side themselves. 
[01:50:30]  It does hundreds of thousands of views without even really trying.  And all these things celebrities say they could be fucking getting to TMZ, their fucking publicity department.  It's, it's almost like someone said, look, don't do, like, they're working against the company on purpose.  Right.  It's almost like they work for Terrestrial Radio.  If I was this fucking awful at my job, I would still be doing Monster Rain jokes. 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  That's like, literally, that's how bad they are.  Status quo, coast.  Hey, just gotta coast.  Hey, just get there.  Do people still yell that out?  Monster Rain.  Once in a while, but not really.  Do you just fucking pummel them with some heavy, blunt object over their head?  I'm just like, what do you want me to do with that?  You know the story?  Assholes.  I suck their dicks, they suck mine.  What, do you think the story changed?  Maybe you're going to add something to it.  Ah, shit.  Is that your free bird? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, it really is.  A free bird.  That's one good thing about a Xanah, but you don't get trapped in bits forever.  Yeah.  Unless you're Kevin Meaney.  He's got to do that.  With Dice in the palm, you know, they want to hear it.  Oh, yeah.  Hickory Dicker, fuck you.  I'm tired, it is.  Oh, my God.  I feel like how many, like, lines, not so much in his act, but just in life, and when  he was on our show, Dice, how many of those lines came from Casino and Goodfellas? 
[01:52:00]  Really?  Like, all that.  Like, I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Right.  Was fucking, yeah, no, I'm over here now.  Right.  In the casino.  Right.  And, and stuff.  Oh, well, we got Club Soda Kenny.  The expert on Andrew Dice Clay.  He, like, so much of his dialogue came from those movies.  Yes, he loved watching movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And especially Casino and Goodfellas, like.  Yeah.  And they would just pick up a little something-something, right?  Yeah.  Gangster movies.  No, no, no.  Because you said.  Yeah.  You said.  That fucking comes from Goodfellas. 
[01:52:30]  It's like, there's so many of those little, little subtle little lines he would pepper  in there that were from those two movies.  Well, one funny thing he used to do, like, during the poems, you know, which he hated to do,  but the fans demanded it.  Ah, yeah.  After every poem, he'd go, thanks for the new pool.  Then he'd go to the next poem, and after the next poem, he goes, thanks for the Rolls-Royce.  What an asshole.  That's pretty good, yeah. 
[01:53:00]  After every poem, he'd go, thanks for the addition on my house.  Ah, shit.  Fucking dice.  Nice.  I'm over here now.  All right, we're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to get this back on the road.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Oh, look at that Sam with his most important thing he does all day.  Handing me copy.  Sirius XM Radio on YouTube.  I didn't even know they had a YouTube channel.  No one else does either. 
[01:53:30]  Why would they promote that?  There's so much nonsense they do promote.  And then they got real shit.  They got videos of a lot of, you know, big names in entertainment.  They're just sitting there.  No one's watching these videos.  Are there any actual promos on the air that say, and our YouTube channel, Sirius XM?  No.  Why wouldn't you do that?  Honestly, it is utter and complete fucking incompetence and mental laziness.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  It is utter fucking sludge.  It's 2013.  You'd think, you know, everybody goes to YouTube to see videos of shit.  Utter fucking utter incompetence and sludge.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, you know what happened, right?  That's crazy.  When they were building these companies and these staffs, they had to pick all the radio  guys that were out of work.  Ah.  So they weren't even really the best at what they did.  We're like England's Australia.  And there's all the degenerates and fucking lowlifes and criminals got fucking ushered 
[01:54:30]  into satellite radio.  Right.  At the time, we had no choice.  No, we didn't.  We were dead in the water with regular radio.  That's why we came aboard here.  Yes, we were.  And I mean, there are definitely talented people here, but there's also a shitload of people  that got their jobs back in the day when they weren't the best at their position, and they're  still here.  We came on when they were saying stuff like, yeah, we should have 600,000 subscribers soon.  And we're like, how many is that?  And we were probably broadcasting to, at the most, 20,000 people. 
[01:55:00]  Probably.  In a day.  Yeah.  20,000 people.  That's nothing.  They had less than a million subscribers when we joined, right?  I think they had half a million.  I think it was 600,000.  What year was it?  2004?  No.  That was serious.  We were over a million.  It was October 4th, 2004.  How many subscribers when we came aboard?  I think a million and a half.  I thought there was a big, how do you do when we hit a million. 
[01:55:30]  So I think we were in the days of under a million.  Yeah, because then you started doing the math.  It's like all these channels.  God, if we could even get 10%.  Dude, it was crazy.  And that number is high.  I used to get all excited when I'd be driving down the road and I'd see a car with a satellite  radio antenna on it because they used to be pretty intrusive.  Right.  Obtrusive, intrusive.  What the fuck word am I looking for?  They used to be pretty obvious.  And it was...  Especially if you were in tunnel traffic and the traffic was going the other way. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  I would sit there and kill time by counting antennas.  And man, it was like maybe one out of 50 fucking cars.  Nothing.  It was so depressing.  It was terrible.  Knowing we had the big, massive, over-the-top radio show in New York.  God, that's right.  The fucking satellite antenna you could put on the...  You could actually count to see how many people had the service, even though they were telling  us something different.  There's one.  But when you were out there in New York in traffic and you were able to count traffic going  the other way, it was not pretty.  It was so depressing just knowing that people weren't fucking even able to hear you. 
[01:56:30]  There were 2.5 million when you guys first started.  What?  On XM?  Yeah, but you guys were also on the premium channel, so...  Oh, right.  God, that was terrible.  $1.99.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they didn't even allow us to talk to the whole fucking...  Yeah, that was...  Subscriber base.  Brilliant idea.  I forgot about that.  Because Hugh Panero hated us.  Hugh.  Fucking hated us.  He should have just not signed us again.  Fuck Hugh.  Uh-huh.  He hated us. 
[01:57:00]  So you had to have XM, and then you had to sign up for us separately.  No one was going to do that.  No, it was fucking crazy.  I mean, our hardcore fans, some of them weren't and did, but that number was low.  You're right.  It was probably 20,000 people.  20,000 at most.  Tops.  Yeah, tops.  I remember when it was 11.  Jesus.  I remember when it was 11.  11 what?  1,000.  11,000 subscribers to our premium service.  I do.  I remember that number specifically.  Oh, God.  When we first started.  Someone said you're talking to 11... 
[01:57:30]  You did.  Someone told you.  I remember you like yesterday at 11,000.  11,000 people signed up for the...  When we first started, yeah.  Oh, my God.  We were talking to a YouTube channel.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  Like a...  Hits on a fucking video.  But you had to sign up for our show and only 11,000...  I came in and told you that one day, that there was 11,000?  No, but it might have just been...  That might have been right before we went on, and it might have ramped up as soon as we  went on.  I mean, I'm not saying that's what we were...  Jeez, that sucks.  But at least we've parlayed that into this room. 
[01:58:00]  We still have the same problem.  We don't even get to talk to the Sirius base.  We're the best of XM package, so they're still shutting us out of more listeners.  I've talked about that with them down the fucking hall.  Down the hall.  Like, give us an hour on Sirius XM.  Use our old material.  I don't give a fuck.  Just give us more exposure on Sirius.  And then maybe they'll sign up for the best of XM.  Yeah.  Make it a nice hour O&A, you know, from the past. 
[01:58:30]  And then maybe that'll turn them into the daily show.  Right.  I offered that up to those guys down the hall.  They didn't want to hear it.  Now they're talking about maybe putting us online or something.  What?  Like an online channel.  Oh, shut the fuck up!  Sorry.  Oh, that's really great in 95.  Hey, guys, we're going to get you online.  We're already online.  No, it'll be an online channel.  Maybe like a classic O&A or something. 
[01:59:00]  This is the shit I have to fucking listen to.  Almost on a daily basis with these guys.  The regular channel is already online.  Why would we need a classic?  You don't.  Because they have a bunch of channels that are only offered online.  And they're thinking maybe there's a place for us there.  That's the way to start a buzz.  Why don't you make up some flyers and paper them on cars outside a fucking church?  Did you guys hear the big buzz?  Opie and Anthony are on the online. 
[01:59:30]  Holy shit!  There's a real buzz started!  Please stop.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It really is just fucking...  That's great!  That's fucking great!  With Internet Explorer 1.  Netscape.  Did you hear the news? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they have a podcast?  No!  They're still talking.  I offered up...  I swear to you, that's got to be over a year ago now, too.  I'm like, look...  You know, I understand you don't want to give our show away for free on Sirius, but we have  such...  We have eight years of material that kind of sit there.  We just don't have enough time to play some of the stuff from the past.  When we go on vacation, we pick and choose and it's all nice.  But we could sustain an hour a day easily with our old material.  Easily. 
[02:00:30]  I said, please, just find a place on SiriusXM.  Make it an hour O&A thing from the past.  Yeah.  So it's not new material.  You're not giving away new material.  And that'll turn people on to, you know, the daily show.  Exactly.  We're still in the...  We're talking about it mode with that one as well.  There's a lot of always just talking about stuff.  Lots of talking.  I don't know what they actually, like, you know, push forward in the end.  I really don't.  That's all it is.  That's why I know the bus tour will not happen.  You don't think so? 
[02:01:00]  No, it's not even a fucking chance.  Not even a chance.  They haven't even talked to Kenny yet.  I suggested that.  I go, there's a guy on staff.  His name's Club Soda Kenny.  You might want to introduce yourself to him.  He went on tour with Andrew Dice Clay for fucking years.  And there are absolute major problems with this bus trip because you don't know shit about how a tour bus runs.  Kenny?  No, they did talk to you.  They finally talked to you.  That's right.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Like, they assume that we could just jump on a bus and go 11 hours. 
[02:01:30]  That's against the rules.  You're not allowed to do that.  Oh, you're not.  But they didn't know that even.  You're not allowed to do that?  No, the first leg of the trip was going to be 11 hours to get down to our first location.  And Kenny went to me and goes, you do realize that's completely and highly illegal.  For the driver, they have to, like...  You're not allowed to drive more than what?  10 hours.  10.  It was close.  Yeah, but you should know.  But rest assured, the promotions department will set up this trip nicely.  Oh, they don't want to hear from you. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  What are some of the issues?  I don't know.  I'm a very low man on the totem poles.  Oh, yeah.  So they barely talked to you.  They politely talked to you.  You went on tour with a guy.  You know this.  They let me know proposed dates and proposed locations.  What are the proposed dates?  The second week in May.  That's what I heard, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Second week in May.  They've known since last month that Jimmy has gigs booked those weekends also. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Anything after Memorial Day, I sent him out.  And I got my son's birthday in there.  I told him all this.  They've had a year.  This should have been booked in April, which is right around the corner now.  Oh, boy.  This is not happening.  It's not happening.  You do know that.  Another thing we've talked about for over a year.  Oh, no.  That will not go down.  Oh, boy.  Add it to the list.  It's not happening. 
[02:03:00]  It's not happening.  Come on.  I was getting all excited.  It's not happening.  I want to do it.  I want to do it badly, but they're going to fuck it up.  What happened?  Oh, man.  I want to go on a bus trip.  We should just make it happen.  We can make it happen.  I don't know how.  I don't know why it's so complicated.  They've had over a year to book the buses.  Booking hotel rooms is easy in these places we're going. 
[02:03:30]  Very easy.  So what could possibly be the holdup?  Well, we're looking into places to go.  I don't know.  I was told promotions department is taking care of everything.  I swear to you.  Uh-oh.  I didn't even know we had a promotions department.  We do.  Neither did anybody who watches YouTube.  Why would we rely on the promotions department?  I'm not yelling at you.  Can you give me a name of who runs the promotion department?  That was a big deal when I was coming up in radio.  You always knew the promotion department. 
[02:04:00]  You always knew who was in charge.  Of course.  I swear to you I didn't know we had one, and I don't know the person that runs it.  Who is it?  And why have they never talked to us?  Does anyone know the name of the person that runs the promotions department here?  Is it Hillary?  No.  Oh, PR.  PR, okay.  Holy fuck.  No one knows.  Promotions.  Anyone?  Anyone?  We've been told we're one of the biggest shows here, and we've never met with the promotion department.  Not that we want another meeting, but they don't even poke their head in and go,  Hey, I just wanted to introduce myself.  I, uh, I'm Blah Blah, and I run promotions here at SiriusXM. 
[02:04:30]  This is a guess on my behalf.  Yeah.  Would it be Ross Zepin?  I think so, but I can't be positive.  When was the last, we haven't talked to him in over a year.  Easily.  And he's best friends with Howard, which is a conflict of interest, obviously.  How is that?  We're all one team.  No, that's true.  That's obvious to everybody we're not.  Oh.  Ross was in Chicago and Cleveland.  What did he do?  I don't even know what he did.  There's Howard, and then there's everyone else. 
[02:05:00]  We all know that.  Oh.  And he's best buds with him.  So why would he ever want to do anything for us?  Hmm.  Especially when all he has to do is make sure, you know, Howard's happy.  The vibe outside of this studio.  Yeah.  Is that the bus trip is on and popping.  It's happening.  Oh.  Why?  You just got a message from somebody?  No, as of yesterday.  Oh.  What did they say?  They said, yeah, the bus trip's happening.  I think it will happen.  I don't necessarily think that it won't happen, as long as we don't fuck it up.  I mean, if we can do, get some dates in May and do it, I think we'll do it. 
[02:05:30]  I would presume it's happening also, because you guys had an offer to do a live show in  Boston to piggyback on Jimmy's comedy taping.  Right.  You rock back.  And that email was ignored.  You were nice to you rock for two days.  I know.  Yeah.  Great.  It was ignored.  Yeah, so I just figured that they were just...  Wait, you emailed?  They didn't even get back to you?  Yeah, they didn't even acknowledge it.  It wasn't even acknowledged.  We have a huge fan base in Boston, so this was a no-brainer to go up there and do a live 
[02:06:00]  broadcast for Jimmy's comedy taping.  Or don't even do it, but just say, like, hey, we would welcome the bus.  But at least get back to us.  Right.  So I guess they're just concentrating their efforts on the bus tour.  Are they?  I presume.  I presume.  You don't know because they didn't get back to you.  Wait till they figure out how much it's going to cost.  That's what's going to make them go, no.  Yeah, they'll be like, well, we couldn't sell it.  And it's not because it's going to be...  We don't even have really any demands, but it's just how they work everything out. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, to have a wall removed for almost half a million dollars, that's all you need  to know.  Do you want me to add the bus trip to the Kickstarter page?  Kickstarter.  Oh, man.  Veronica Mars made three million.  Yeah.  I mean, if Veronica Mars can do it, so can we.  It's great.  Yeah, let's do that.  Nice.  I'm going to start a Kickstarter to pay my mortgage.  That bus driver made it.  It's a show.  No, but I want a Kickstarter. 
[02:07:00]  It's just going to be called Opie's Mortgage.  I want to see if people would bite.  I'm sure they would.  They would bite.  You've got to give things away, though, at certain price points.  Sudoku puzzles.  Sudoku puzzles.  Okay, good.  I'm not thinking.  I had to rip today's up.  I fucked up.  Oh.  Any Daily News is around?  I could just start over.  Jimmy, you all right?  It's like an utter disgust.  I mean, it's a real disgust.  Yeah, I don't even know how you work this out.  Because you know these people are completely incompetent, so you're not going to have the 
[02:07:30]  work relationship with that.  It's been happening for years, but it bleeds into...  I don't even know how it works out.  Management and other issues are my own personal stuff, too.  And it's just like, the only way to get shit done is to do it yourself.  Literally, you can't rely on people.  And I've known that for years.  You can't rely on people because they all fuck up.  Because they don't have the interest in it that you do.  They care, but they don't have the interest in it that you do.  Right.  And, um...  Oh, it's not like we're an up-and-coming show, though.  I always assumed we got to this point in our careers, we would be taken care of a little more. 
[02:08:00]  Well, no.  We got to take care of ourselves.  We're not like Kavino and Rich or something, even though they're taken care of a little  better than us.  They bring those guys to the big events.  Let me tell you, that's a terrific show.  You like it?  Yeah.  I like this guy, yeah.  Yeah, I'm not saying I don't like him.  I'm just saying, for whatever reason, they get invited to the big events.  The big broadcast.  They're easy to take.  Those two guys and a couple mics.  Throw them in a hotel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They probably share a bet.  Motel, motel. 
[02:08:30]  They share a bet.  I've heard.  Motel, motel.  It probably costs like a grand total of $425 to send the show anywhere.  Yeah.  We're too expensive?  You're more than $425, yeah.  That's an estimate, but I haven't done the figures, but I think this show is at least  $700, $800.  They're so worth it, though.  Sure are.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I don't know why they wouldn't want to go up to Boston.  I mean, I have two shows that sold out in 48 hours.  We have a fan base up there. 
[02:09:00]  What was their response to the email?  I wouldn't know.  They didn't even acknowledge it.  Who would you write?  Yeah.  I wrote two people in this company in my chain of command.  Who?  Fair question.  Travis, would you like to say?  Was I one of them?  Yes.  Okay.  I was one of them.  I got one.  Oh.  How come you didn't get back to them?  Who, me?  Yeah.  I did.  Kenny and I talked about it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, who didn't get back to you? 
[02:09:30]  The next person above Travis.  Oh.  I don't even know who that is.  Eric?  No.  No, I'm kidding.  No.  I won't say his name, but his initials are R.W.  Radio.  Wizard.  Oh, Jesus.  That guy.  I didn't get that either.  Really?  He didn't even get back to you?  No.  That's great.  I mean, I don't even know how you work around that. 
[02:10:00]  It's not like we're saying we want to go to Kentucky.  It's Boston.  We did really well up there.  And Jimmy's filming his next special up there.  So you got to at least get back to the show.  Yeah.  That's an easy trip.  It's just a train.  You don't need to repair anything.  Yeah, but the point is he didn't even get back to Kenny.  You take a train, you go to a hotel, do an afternoon show on Friday.  Jimmy, I would drive myself.  Who cares?  But you know what I'm saying?  That's an easy...  I would jump in a car after this show, go up there nice, do a live broadcast. 
[02:10:30]  Yes.  So I need a hotel.  That's this.  I would drive myself.  I don't give a fuck about an Amtrak fucking ticket or anything.  And if you have a PR part of the company, you make a big deal about it.  You get interviews in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  You get the word out there.  You know, maybe you get an interview in the paper or you do something and you have a purpose  to the visit.  Not just the show, but something else that's company oriented.  It's like utter, absolute utter lack of vision and incompetence.  Yeah.  But in all fairness, G.H., the company did send you to L.A. and put you on a great TV 
[02:11:00]  project that's going to be coming out soon.  They didn't have anything to do with that.  That was the company's doing?  No.  They didn't have anything to do with it.  They really didn't.  Where did the people reach out?  The people reached out.  Exactly.  So how did the company do it?  Well, they footed the bill.  They paid some...  They paid some of the...  Not all the bill.  Paid some of the bill.  Gee.  They're getting good fucking PR out of it.  It's a TBS show. 
[02:11:30]  My episode's not until June.  I just found out.  June?  Yeah, so I'm not even really...  Damn.  It's called Who Gets the Last Laugh?  It looks pretty good.  Who gets the last laugh of the company?  Yeah.  I was happy how my episode turned out.  Ooh.  Very happy, so...  Spoiler alert.  No spoiler alert.  Spoiler alert.  Just happy.  I'm pitching a prank show.  Oh.  Yeah.  Where we do, like, little wacky pranks.  Like, um... 
[02:12:00]  Any ideas?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's one I want to do where it's in the hospital, in the maternity ward.  Uh-oh.  And what we do is, we, like, we have, like, a fake fire where all the little bassinets are.  Yeah?  And we come out and tell all the parents, we're sorry, but the fire's burned all of your babies.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  And then...  Who are you pitching this to?  Uh, NBC.  NBC.  Okay.  And then they cry and they scream. 
[02:12:30]  Uh-huh.  And two weeks later, we get back in time.  Two weeks later?  You let them hang on the line for two weeks?  Yeah.  On the way out.  Wow.  And we interview people on the way out of the funerals.  Oh, my gosh.  And we keep the little tykes in a special room.  You take care of the little tykes, right?  Yes, we have, like, we have people we hire that will breastfeed them.  Okay, good.  And do that initial bonding.  And then...  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Initial bonding.  And then the kid goes back to the family. 
[02:13:00]  The initial bonding.  Yeah, but we're going to do it in a bunch of hospitals and then just show all the episodes.  It's called...  Yeah.  It's called your baby's dead.  And the last D is tipped, almost like a half a smile, like, oh, no.  Wow.  I can picture the logo.  Your baby's dead.  It's just a prank show.  We have different...  It's just an innocent prank show.  Yeah, but, like, one, there's a fire, and then the other one, when all the parents are in the waiting room, 
[02:13:30]  we hire an actress to play a nurse, and she goes, oh!  Oh!  And then the parents run to the window, and there's a lion, and we put fake blood in all  the bassinets, and the lion has a little diaper in his mouth.  And the nurse is like, I don't know what happened.  I went to get a marmalade, and when I came back, the babies had been eaten.  And what's the big reveal?  Is there, like, a big tagline?  Like, you've just been punked? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Um, oh, it's, come on, lighten up, here's your kid.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  Yeah.  I'd watch that.  Yeah.  And then there's the one version, the holiday version, where what we do is we get someone  who has a miscarriage, and then when they go, like, oh, I'm so upset, we're like, ah,  he's fine.  And then...  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  That's not good. 
[02:14:30]  NBC, huh?  And then the big reveal, that all is not well.  Your baby's dead?  Yeah.  That's what it's called?  Yeah.  That's good.  I like that.  I think in the O for your, you have, like, a big tear coming out of, like, the face.  Or, like, an open mouth, like, oh!  Yeah, yeah, oh!  A little shocked.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I think that would be a great show.  Yeah.  NBC, huh?  Yeah.  I'm trying to get Yafit Kodo to host it.  And I want to get big celebrities to play the nurses and the doctors. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And they come out and tell the people that they're, you know...  Yeah, because this way, this way, like, the woman, we're like, your baby's dead.  She'll be, oh, my God, you look like Kathy Bates.  Who's on your short list?  Kathy Bates, who else?  Kathy Bates would be the nice one.  Taylor Swift.  Tina Fey, maybe?  She's...  They love her at NBC.  Nah, Tina Fey.  No?  I don't want to use her.  No?  She's too popular.  Taylor Swift isn't?  Taylor Swift has an underground following.  I don't think on TV they'll know who she is. 
[02:15:30]  Just put a different, like, hairstyle on her?  Yeah.  And people think, like, what if they recognize them?  I'll be like, that'd be too grief-stricken.  Yeah, true.  They're not going to think.  They think their baby's dead.  They're not going to care.  You should get some of your celebrity friends, like Ricky Gervais.  Yeah, your baby's dead.  That'd be great.  There's been a death up there.  Sorry.  Death in the nursery.  Yeah, get the fire version.  You got the fucking lion.  Ate all the kids.  A lion.  How did a lion get into the little nursery area? 
[02:16:00]  There's, um...  We set it up where all the parents are coming in.  In the back, there's a fucking, like, a lion cage parked.  Parked.  Because they're having a circus in the parking lot.  Parked.  Yeah.  I didn't know you could park a lion cage.  Yeah, you could park a lion cage there.  It's supposed to be, uh...  It's a circus.  Oh, a circus is going on.  In the hospital parking lot?  Yes, to honor all the new babies.  Oh.  And ironically... 
[02:16:30]  The lion gets loose?  How does the lion get loose, though?  They don't...  They don't say.  How does he get up the elevator?  Hmm.  That's a good question.  Nobody will ask that in the time of grief.  No, they'll just be so grief-stricken.  It's a technical question.  He puts his five buttons, and...  Yeah, he gets in.  That's right.  A nurse's hat is missing, and they see the lion.  He's wearing, like, a tattered nurse outfit.  Uh-huh.  So they know what happened.  He pretends.  Like Heath Ledger in Batman?  Yes.  That's all the babies.  Pause.  They could have a ceiling collapse, perhaps, where they're all underneath a bunch of I-beams 
[02:17:00]  and rubble.  A lot of rubble.  Rubble.  Yeah.  That'd be a good one.  The father's handing out cigars, and we come out, we go, you might want to put those  away.  That gets some laughs.  Yeah.  Yeah, you might want to put those away.  That's right.  Your baby's got rubble on them.  If I see him, he'll have to say, no, we incinerated him.  Because we had to get the room cleaned up.  They moved fast. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, we did.  We incinerated him.  We shoveled everything out and threw it in the incinerator.  Oh, my God.  That's a hell of a show.  Yeah.  This sounds like a big budget.  Is this primetime, NBC?  It has to be.  It is, yes.  To be rerun Sunday morning.  After what show?  That's at 10 p.m.  10 p.m.?  Five nights a week.  Your baby's dead.  Five nights a week.  Can you imagine the outrage?  Oh, God.  Oh, would that be bad? 
[02:18:00]  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  Very funny.  That's a good show.  But again, the kids are fine.  Yeah.  Except for the one special episode.  What is that one?  Where the miscarriage just happened.  They're like, yeah, he's good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Then you hand him over.  See how long...  And the hidden camera follows the parents.  Like, hey.  Hey.  What an interesting little show.  I'm on board.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a little break. 
[02:18:30]  Why don't we?  We're going to get into some other shit after the break here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.  People are very confused out there.  At?  They think I'm bitching.  I'm not bitching.  I was.  I think this...  You're bitching.  I think the whole thing at this point in my career is completely hilarious.  That's the angle I now take. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  The old version of me, abso-fucking-lutely bitching, trying to get things done.  Now I just find it completely hilarious.  I do not go home mad or even think about it anymore.  That shit hilarious?  I think it's hilarious that a wall costs almost a half million dollars to remove.  I think it's hilarious that this company has massive pop culture stars and they film these  people and they only get hundreds of views.  That is hilarious to me.  I think it's hilarious that we talk about a bus trip for over a year and it's not going 
[02:19:30]  to happen.  All this shit is just fucking hilarious and material for me.  They say it's happening, by the way.  Well, they've said that about a million things, which I also find hilarious.  I'll tell you a story about Stan Main.  When I was a little schmuck, I'm still a schmuck, but I'm an older schmuck now, coming up in  the business, I had an opportunity to work at CMF.  I had no business being at CMF, but I got a little who gives a fuck job. 
[02:20:00]  But I realized, oh my God, I can learn radio.  And this guy, Stan Main, is Brother Weez's program director and the station's kicking ass.  I'm going to fucking shadow this guy to learn everything I can about radio.  And I would go to his house every once in a while.  The guy was in charge of CMF.  So what did he do?  He had the radio station on in every single fucking room in his house, even in the bathroom,  because he didn't want to miss anything.  And when something popped up, he had a fucking notepad and he would write little notes to  make sure nothing fell through the cracks. 
[02:20:30]  He was a program director for a little station in Rochester, New York.  That's it.  We got a guy that runs, he's overseas, Sirius XM.  I'm convinced he doesn't even listen to the show.  Oh boy.  And guess what?  I'm not bitching.  I think that's hilarious too.  I find all this shit hilarious at this point in my life and career.  It's completely ridiculous.  And there's going to be no solution.  And I find that hilarious too.  It just goes on and on. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Yeah.  The old days at NAW, we bitched a lot because we knew we could change things.  I thought I could change things around here.  Uh, it's been well over a year that I realized that is never going to happen.  And that's when I changed my tune.  And now I just openly laugh.  When Jimmy gets really mad, it's so much fun for me to just laugh at it.  Poor Jimmy.  So update what you know about me out there in Radio Land.  I'm not the bitching guy.  I'm not the bitching guy anymore.  I find it all hilarious. 
[02:21:30]  That shit hilarious.  And I find it hilarious now that we bitched about Gary and Rob and the rest of them,  that they're now going to take it out on our staff today in their meeting.  I find that hilarious.  You looking forward to your Tuesday meeting there?  They hate when we do this on Tuesdays because that's when they meet with those dummies.  Yeah, I don't think it's that hilarious.  No?  No.  You find it hilarious too because you see through their nonsense.  I know maybe you don't want to, you know, vocalize that today on our show. 
[02:22:00]  But you're smart enough to see through their horseshit too.  And I find that hilarious.  It definitely makes for new talking points at the meeting when you guys do this.  Are they going to yell at you guys now?  Yes.  They're going to turn it around on you guys?  Yes.  And as soon as they leave this building, I'll pretty much forget that we even talked about this place.  And guess what?  They have to be, they have to stick around and clean up our mess.  Oh, boy.  I find it hilarious that a chair I've been sitting in for a couple years is rotting away in front of my face 
[02:22:30]  and no one will ever fix that.  It's like a metaphor.  Yeah, it is a metaphor.  And, you know, quite literally it's a chair falling apart too.  That this dumb black thing hung for months.  Oh, don't say that about him.  And no one wanted to fix that.  I found it hilarious that it took over a year to get a fucking coat hanger for a dumb fucking coat.  Abortion.  Because they had to talk about that for fucking months and months because they weren't sure if it would mess up the sound in the room.  Remember that one?  That was ridiculous. 
[02:23:00]  That's why I couldn't fucking hang up my coat for a long, long time because they thought it would fuck up the ambient sound.  I thought that was going to be the excuse for the wall is that, hey, we put up a coat rack hanger thing for you.  We can't take that down.  That costs $6,000 alone.  But as far as bitching, nope.  It might come across that way, but I just find it all hilarious.  The lights, it took how many years?  Oh, many, many years.  Two years easily to finally get lights.  When you're getting a talking to during the meeting, just you can relax a little bit knowing that I will be in my bed at home sleeping. 
[02:23:30]  What possible solace would that bring me?  That I won't be affected by the meeting and by the lack of drive on the part of the bosses.  Once again, your comfort is my paramount, so that will...  Exactly, that's what I knew, so that's why I said that.  I find it hilarious that they have to have meetings without us.  The guys, it's our names on the wall, and they can't even have meetings with us. 
[02:24:00]  I thought it was another Anthony.  Huh?  You guys don't want to go to meetings.  You won't go to the meetings?  No.  I hate the meetings.  We used to.  They don't do anything.  No, we used to when we thought they mattered.  Oh.  Don't get me wrong.  Nothing happens.  I still have passion for what I do, but I'm not going to waste my time in meetings when I know nothing can get done.  We humor bladder, and we do that meeting every once in a while, every three months.  But that's all just talk, talk, talk.  We're talking about it.  We're still in the talking stage.  We're talking about this. 
[02:24:30]  This guy has to get back to us.  This department has to get back to us.  But in the meantime, we're talking about it.  We're still in that stage.  You know, like the old, the idea of, you know, tossing around ideas like it was, you know, football?  We did that, and none of the ideas would make the air.  Not one.  And how about the idea of getting a fucking, the wall knocked down, or the idea of getting cameras in?  It really is a futile waste of time.  So why would I do that?  I'd rather spend time with my kids than in meetings for an hour.  If I knew these meetings would lead to actual, you know, improvements, sure. 
[02:25:00]  I'm all in still.  But I know that's impossible here because of how this place is set up.  Everyone's powerless.  We were told that the wall was going to be removed by the mean guy.  Scott Greenstein said, yeah, we'll get that done for you.  And he said, we can't give you the whole studio, which we wanted.  So the compromise was we get the whole studio, and it was the whole studio.  That's right.  But there was a compromise where I accepted. 
[02:25:30]  I said, all right, at least give us a little taste of that space, and we'll be very happy.  Thank you, Scott.  He goes, yeah, no problem.  We'll get that done.  Of course it's like the main guy told me that, not some middle management guy.  But then, you know, you can't expect them to spend half a million dollars.  Oh, no.  It's crazy.  So.  Break that wall down.  But I find it just all hilarious.  That's just my dumb point right now.  You probably can't be bothered by it.  Someday I'll be bothered by this stuff again when I know I'm at a place or a situation where  it matters again. 
[02:26:00]  If we can't rip the wall down, can we fill that up with water and make a big fish tank?  Like, look at that, like the two things that went, wouldn't that be great to look at  E-Rock through a fucking big fish tank?  Look like there's a whale in the tank.  You know what?  Let me tell you the difference, though.  You joke.  Yeah.  But if we went to Ken Stevens back at N.E.W. and demanded a fish tank?  Yeah.  Am I lying?  Am I lying?  He'd have been there.  He would have figured it out.  Absolutely.  He came in with a giant pen because we refused to sign his dumb contract. 
[02:26:30]  Take the pen.  Oh, Roland did something evil during the break.  Very evil.  Roland pitches guests whenever he can.  Oh, yeah.  That was very smart on Roland's part.  But very evil as well.  Yes.  Keep learning.  So, you know, during commercials, he'll come in and he'll give us a list of names on the  way out.  He'll give us a list of names whenever he can.  You guys want his game videos on your show?  Right.  Wahoo?  Now he's showing us pictures of actresses that we would never say yes to.  Yeah.  But now he's showing us these same actresses in lingerie. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  And we just said yes to somebody we would never say yes to because he shows a picture of her  in lingerie and she looks damn good.  I said no to her already.  No, so did I.  With the headshot.  The regular celebrity headshot he showed me.  He goes, she's been into the quantum solace and she was doing bongos.  I was like, nah, who's she?  I don't care.  And then he brings in fucking smoking, wearing nothing but panties and a bra.  Tiny lingerie.  Yeah, and looking amazing.  And then me and Opie are both looking going, hey, you know, she might be a good guest. 
[02:27:30]  I don't even know the first thing about her.  And then he's pitching, I guess, Laura Dern.  You want to see her in lingerie?  No.  Not anymore.  But I guess Jurassic Park is 3D.  3D Jurassic Park.  So they're pitching it.  And then he said, what's the guy's name?  Sam what?  It's the same.  It's the original one being re-released.  Are they going to add some scenes with that technology?  Yeah, like the dinosaurs flying all over the place, kicking up dirt, whatever. 
[02:28:00]  Sam Neill, that's it.  Sam Neill.  But he goes, is Sam Neill?  I was like, Samuel Jackson?  Isn't that Sam Neill?  I swear to you, I thought he said Samuel Jackson, too.  That's what I thought he said.  He said Sam Neill.  It was Sam Neill.  Sam Neill Jackson.  Wouldn't you add extra scenes in that if you got the 3D technology?  Yeah, some dinosaurs.  Why not?  Some of the...  A few more dinosaurs.  Some of those just scenery shots and stuff just kind of make some new scenes, no?  I have an idea for a great scene, but they don't want to do that.  Your last idea. 
[02:28:30]  It's Rolando.  Didn't do well.  It's where the dinosaurs are running to the beat of the Macarena.  And the T-Rex gets all mad because he can't do the Macarena because of his little arms.  So he's all angry and he eats the other dinosaurs with long arms.  I used to hate seeing this at a wedding.  And everybody turns.  Oh, there they go.  They just turned 90 degrees. 
[02:29:00]  Here we go.  It's definitely one of those go-to songs.  Now here it is.  Hey!  All right, now clap.  Oh, and they turned again.  I'll tell you where it's great, though.  At a funeral.  Where you pick up the arms of the body and make them do the Macarena.  Holy shit!  They're like, you look so peaceful.  Especially if it's a small, tunic coffin.  Wait a minute.  This guy.  No, no, don't do that.  I know what you're doing.  Oh, E-Rock.  Greg on Long Island.  Greg! 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to...  I'm glad that you're laughing about it there.  Oh.  But, you know, the XM subscribers who, you know, paid to hear you guys.  We're being upset now because we have to listen to all the things, especially me, because I saw this coming, you know, years ago.  You know, we got to listen to everything that is being done to you. 
[02:30:00]  And you would think that, you know, you're going to be able to, you know, have all of these things accomplished.  You can't even get Jim Norton's appearances on Jay Leno played on your air.  You know, you're right.  I mean, if you can't even get that...  Well, they don't even know...  They don't even really care that Jimmy's on Jay Leno mentioning the company's name.  They don't even give a fuck.  Right.  They don't even give a fuck about that.  Why should he?  Yeah.  I mean, we should be playing Jimmy's appearances on our show. 
[02:30:30]  That's...  We messed up on that one.  Nah, but I don't want...  I mean, I feel embarrassed hearing them when I'm here.  Yeah, but we throw them, you know, throw them in as we go to break and stuff.  We're out of break.  We definitely should be doing that, Greg.  You know, at the least, they should put you on 105 on Sirius.  But you know why they don't?  What?  They got you all the way at 207 or whatever because they know that most of the older Sirius units can't get that channel.  Which is true.  Yes.  So they bury you up there.  Yeah, it's so weird.  Then why have us here at all? 
[02:31:00]  I don't understand.  If you're going to have us, why don't you take advantage of it and use us?  And what's the best...  Why would you have us and bury us?  I don't know.  What's the best of XM?  There's nothing left.  There's you and what?  I begged.  I begged.  I begged.  I go, look, you guys feel like you're making a lot of money and maybe you are because we're part of the best of XM package.  But, you know, we'd be so excited to be open up to the entire Sirius base.  And I think you would make your money back in the end because maybe, you know, they would turn more people on to just getting the service in general. 
[02:31:30]  This is boring for everybody, so I'm going to shut up now.  Thank you, Greg.  You should.  All right, Bob.  I told all of this to Sam.  I'm sure Sam loved it.  The day that you signed your contract in October, I gave him a whole list of the things that you should have been in the contract.  You still got that list, Sam?  Comment.  We like lists.  Comment.  We're going to have a...  Right.  We're working on a book of lists, by the way.  Yes.  If I record it.  It's going to be a coffee table book.  I'm working on a book of lisps.  Lisps. 
[02:32:00]  I have a book of lists.  You do?  I do.  A bunch of lists.  Yeah?  Yeah.  John list?  Yes.  Yes.  I actually did...  It was one of the first things I wrote in all...  It was a list of lists.  Yes.  A list list.  Oh, that's right.  Like the 50 funniest moments in child pornography.  Oh, yes.  Women with the worst smelling pussies in order of ethnicity.  I would so buy that book.  Yeah, I really should.  There's no real list. 
[02:32:30]  The joke is in the list title.  It's the list title.  You should just throw it out there as a little thing.  List of lists.  List of lists.  So Roland is now showing us pictures of women in lingerie to get up on our show.  I don't even know her name and I said yes to her.  Huh?  Olga.  Olga.  Olga.  All right.  We'll say hi to Olga.  Could you come in here in lingerie?  No.  Why?  If she did the photo shoot, what's the difference?  She might be cold.  Well, we'll warm it up in here for her.  Exactly.  What's the difference of that shit?  If you did a photo shoot and you were in lingerie, why wouldn't you come in here if  that's our request and just do the interview in lingerie? 
[02:33:00]  It's less comfortable, probably.  For who?  With the girl.  Why?  You'd be staring at her like, ooh, boobies.  Tell her we want to see her stinky baby maker.  Hey, could I throw something out there that maybe somebody can look for?  Because I've been getting some intel here.  Apparently, Nick Cage is on Jimmy Kimmel last night.  Yes.  And did he talk about his flight being on a plane? 
[02:33:30]  Something about Jimmy Kimmel and him being on a plane and how fun it would be or something.  Wait, they actually, I thought you were making a joke.  No, I think it was.  They actually talked about being on a plane together?  I think.  I don't know.  Kimmel was Jennifer Love Hewitt.  What?  Jimmy Kimmel was Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Well, who was?  He's Jimmy Kimmel.  Oh, Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, Fallon.  I loved it.  It was a sketch.  Do you remember where you were trying to name a baby?  Oh, right.  Yes.  Yes.  Did he look like that?  You didn't want to name your kid.  Yeah, and I didn't want to name him John or Kyle or anything like that.  No, you kept shooting everything down.  She's like, Ben.  And you're like, oh, great. 
[02:34:00]  Ben and Jerry, get me some ice creamer.  I'll kick the crap out of you.  You can't call him Ben.  And then Rob delivered the pizza to me.  Right.  And he said, this is for Mr. Aswipe Johnson.  No, no.  Did he have the face of Eric, Jimmy?  No, he did not.  On the plane?  No.  He just grew that?  Yeah.  Crazy.  As per my request.  Yeah, look around for the clip.  That would be funny if they're talking about being on a plane together.  Was it Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel?  Fallon.  It was.  Fallon was last night, right?  Wait.  Yeah, then it was last night.  Why didn't we get Nick Cage to come back?  I thought he had a good time on our show. 
[02:34:30]  Well, he's doing a cartoon.  Who?  Jimmy Norton?  No.  He's just doing it for the cartoon.  He's only doing Fallon.  Cartoon.  Huh?  Huh?  Go ahead.  You think we'll get him back?  Go ahead.  So I'm on the Opie and Anthony show, but I wasn't.  You were in one day, but I wasn't there.  All right.  Oh.  I think of that so much during my days.  You and me both.  I just think of him, him and you on that plane.  Yeah, see, apparently he said something. 
[02:35:00]  I heard there was some mention of an airplane.  Something about a plane on a plane.  Something about a plane.  A guy in a dress on a plane.  A guy in a plane on a plane on a dress.  That's so funny.  You guys are big fans of proposals?  No.  Proposals?  A what?  Oh, like a...  There was an article in the paper today that you can't just ask someone to marry you anymore.  It has to be an over-the-top production.  And, like, women are starting to expect that.  Fuck them.  They're starting to expect more than the, hey, will you marry me shit.  Enough of that.  I have the best way.  Really?  Oh, Jimmy.  And how is this? 
[02:35:30]  It's a new show.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Um, and it's called, uh, Will You Marry Me?  Okay.  And it's funny places where they, uh, we fake, like, there's one where a girl is jogging.  Uh-huh.  And we have, um, nine Negro actors grab her.  Right.  And drag her into an alley.  Yeah.  And they have a rubber knife. 
[02:36:00]  And they take her clothes off, and they are pretending they're about to rape her.  Yeah.  And then as she's going, ah, that her boyfriend, uh, the, the, the black guy opens up a hand,  and there's a ring, and he goes, yo, what is this?  Oh, well.  And she goes, it's a ring.  And then her boyfriend pops out from behind and says, will you marry me, Helen?  Helen.  Helen.  That's a good, that's a good one.  It's crazy wedding things.  But all the women have to be named Helen.  Yeah.  Well. 
[02:36:30]  A little twist.  Hey, why is that a different clip?  This is the one from last night.  Oh, so he doesn't have official hair.  I don't know.  Oh, see, that doesn't look like he, he just looked.  Is there any airplane stuff yet?  I'm listening to it.  Should we pop it up?  What's he talking about right there?  He's talking about, uh, St. Patrick's Day parade.  Huh?  Huh?  Gonna be in it?  Go ahead.  I love, I love, I love the, I love the talk show guy has to always sit so much higher. 
[02:37:00]  He is higher.  Fallon is at least a head taller.  Yeah, yeah.  When sitting down than his guest.  Look at that.  And they all do it.  Yes.  Andy Kaufman had a classic bit about that.  Remember the sketch where.  Oh, he was on a giant desk.  His seat was probably eight to ten feet higher than the guest.  Feet.  And he was looking all the way down.  Feet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was feet.  Has anyone ever tried to do the talk show with the guest on the right side of the screen? 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  Uh, Graham Norton does that in England.  It's a great show.  Yeah, but they do everything backwards.  But he does like, uh, it's, it's, it's on a couch though, right?  They're all kind of sitting there.  He's not at a desk.  I'm talking the, the actual, the Johnny Carson, David Letterman, the desk and the guest chairs.  Has anyone switched it around?  And, and why do they decide it works better?  That way.  Because your eyes go from left to right.  So wouldn't you want to see the, uh, the host and then the guest kind of? 
[02:38:00]  I don't know.  It's just an odd thing.  Well, don't forget the Tonight Show has just been that set for so long.  Yeah.  And then Letterman kind of, you know, I don't know.  Maybe it's just become the standard.  I think it has.  And I think people will probably be uncomfortable seeing it that way.  Any other way?  There'll be something uncomfortable with it.  So they probably did research too.  Yeah.  I bet they did some research.  Yeah.  That's how I want to do it though.  Yeah.  I actually want to do us with me and then the celebrity with his back to the audience  facing me.  Sitting in a chair like.  Yes.  He can only see me.  That would be so bad. 
[02:38:30]  Can't you at least rotate so they get to see him a little bit?  Oh.  No.  Maybe it's in the round.  On the way out.  You can put a bus driver mirror over the host's head.  Okay.  And the audience can see him looking up at the mirror.  Like, remember the bus driver eyes?  You'd catch him in the mirror looking at you and you had to stop doing what you were doing?  Yeah.  You'd have to look and go, all right, he's not that good.  All right, we're going to give this another try.  A rat who's always peeking up trying to see what the fuck is going on.  Well, he wanted it on the action.  Yeah.  That's such a rude comment. 
[02:39:00]  Is it rude?  It was.  It wasn't even a good joke.  No, it wasn't.  I just thought it was such a rude.  It was something.  Again, you have to stop what you're doing.  Yeah.  And my mind immediately went, you have to put your dick away and then put the baby back  in the back.  Oh, Jesus.  But it's almost like that's where my mind first went. 
[02:39:30]  Of course it is.  But where's the joke in that?  You're on the bus.  There's no joke.  Fucking infant.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  I just caught myself.  Like, what a creep to think that would be a humorous, enjoyable thing for the audience  here.  It's a humorous anecdote.  Conway Tweety on the Twitter there.  Oh, I've heard of him.  If you guys were any further down the, I just lost the tweet.  If you were, if you guys were any further down the dial on Sirius, you would be in the  glove box.  Very good.  Denny!  Denny said that. 
[02:40:00]  I want him on the air so bad today, but I feel like we've got to rest him a little  bit.  He killed him in the after show, too.  Don't put him on the after show.  Don't burn our guy out.  Oh, he did.  Don't burn him out.  I got a bit for him already.  What do you have him doing?  We're going to have a DJ off.  With who?  Troy, who, kid, and Denny.  They're going to all do their thing at the turntables, the ones and twos.  And see who's like style is a little.  We should do that.  It's not a competition.  It's more an exhibition, right?  It's not about who's the best.  Right.  I heard that, which I honestly absolutely know what fucking Sam, manipulative Sam Roberts 
[02:40:30]  was doing.  It is a competition.  Of course it is.  It is to see who's better than the other.  It's basically a fight to the death.  Right.  Right.  Are we doing it on this show?  Let's do it here.  Why would we do it here?  Let's do that.  It's a good bit.  Yeah, let's do it.  We'll have more time in it, too.  I'll stole your bit.  Jesus Christ.  Just like that.  Just like that.  By the way, James Lipton has his guest on the right, which is true.  Yeah, but it's not a desk thing, is it?  Yeah, but it's a big interview show.  Don't they just sit on a stool? 
[02:41:00]  Damn, that's a great, because he said it's a master's.  He spun it really well.  What a great, comfortable atmosphere.  He's old, but he's fucking completely.  Is he really 86?  He's completely with it.  Yeah, he is.  Because I thought he got that date wrong or something.  No, he is.  You see people that are like with it and shit, but they're a little slow.  You know, they fucking get old and shit.  That guy is completely.  Very sharp.  Like aware, like if you're 20.  Moves a little slow, but he's very sharp.  Yeah, he moves slow, but his mind is like fucking right there.  Yeah, it's right there.  What's he doing with the dying in that beard, though? 
[02:41:30]  What's he doing there?  Oh, I couldn't tell.  Oh, boy.  Is it a love to a man?  That's for TV.  Is it?  Yeah, you see some of these guys in person.  I do that for TV, but you know.  On TV, it looks good, but when you're not on TV, it looks good.  But 86, you'd figure, eh, you know, who am I trying to fool?  That's good on TV.  At this point.  Hey, so we got a proposal.  It's all about the proposal.  Like I said, a lot of women expecting more than just you getting down on your knee and  saying, will you marry me?  It's got to be some big fucking thing. 
[02:42:00]  Another thing that we have to worry about.  Right.  You've seen the viral videos.  There's a bunch of them now of over-the-top proposals.  Uh-huh.  Anyway, with that said, here's a proposal that went down on the news.  Oh.  Do you have some breaking news to report to you?  Fox 54 has just learned that a Huntsville news anchor is being proposed on live TV right  now.  Hello, my dear.  Hi.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[02:42:30]  On the news?  Is there video of this?  Where's the video?  Is it embarrassing?  Where's the fucking video?  How about you just do it traditionally?  Yeah.  I know a lot of people do it at a sporting event.  I get so uncomfortable.  I hate that at a sporting event.  Don't let Gus watch it.  Huh?  Don't let Gus watch your fucking proposal.  Who gives a fuck?  I'm a jumbotron.  I always just watch the couple longer than I guess most.  And then you see, then they just go back to watching the game.  Watch the game.  Wouldn't you just leave it at that point?  Yeah.  Go to a bar or a restaurant or something, but then all the light, you know, they turn 
[02:43:00]  off the cameras and they're off the big jumbotron and next thing you know, you keep staring  at them and they turn back around and watch the game.  They're just some saps you don't want to fucking look at.  Was this put on her teleprompter apparently?  Yeah.  And she started reading it like a news story because they're just newsreaders.  Right.  And she realized that it was a proposal.  Remind me to tell you of a really good idea for a marriage.  Oh, yeah.  You will.  Right after this.  Do you have some breaking news to report to you?  Fox 54 has just learned that a Huntsville news anchor is being proposed on live TV right 
[02:43:30]  now.  Oh, my dear.  Hello, my dear.  Hi.  For years we've talked about this.  Breaking news, four-aligned fire in a nursery.  They have to cut away.  They cut away from a stupid proposal.  There's a rape happening in the middle of the baseball field and they have to cut away. 
[02:44:00]  I am so uncomfortable.  Oh, that is crazy.  And the guy doesn't work at the news station, obviously.  I wouldn't think so.  Good thing Sam didn't make it full screen, so, you know, we can't really see.  Yeah, let's go full screen.  It would have been crazy to work.  He doesn't.  And let's go back slightly.  He actually throws out the fucking...  His job is to fucking take all the hair off the fucking wax in a fucking Brazilian waxing  place so they can reuse it.  He's got nice legs.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  The anchor woman there has the nice legs.  It's a shitty dress, though.  Yeah.  It's like Scarface's couch.  All right.  Let's see.  We proposed on live TV right now.  They step away from the green screen with you.  Hi.  For years we've talked about this.  And for years...  Gonna be my wife, Lorraine!  Our time would come.  Finally, all of our pieces are falling together. 
[02:45:00]  And I can't picture a day in my life...  I'm not squeezing those tits.  Fast forward to you in court.  Calling her a cunt.  Down on the knee.  Traditional.  Down on one knee.  Will you marry me?  Oh.  You ought to put hardcore porno on the green screen behind him on 7.  This big fucking cock getting socked in.  What did you do with the news lingo?  Will you always be my anchor?  All right.  Where's the news? 
[02:45:30]  Now, sports.  Yes.  I feel like I'm dreaming.  Oh, yeah.  Wait for the nightmare.  You find out he's fucking the fucking weather girl.  Wait till he comes home with warts.  Jesus.  All right.  Get off the set, cocksucker.  Congratulations.  I wish you forgot and was wearing all green so it just looked like a floating head.  Fucking dumb floating head proposing to her.  Yeah, or he forgot that he was wearing a show from his buddy's bachelor party shirt. 
[02:46:00]  And on the front it was nice, but on the back it said, world's best cutler.  Yeah, that video's doing well.  Son of a bitch.  Is it virile?  It's a bit virile.  I got more views than Taylor Swift in a fucking serious interview of course.  Yes, it did.  My idea is, it's not even a vicious one.  No?  If you take a girl out to a restaurant, like a fucking, like a sushi place.  Sure.  And you sit at the sushi bar and you order a tall glass of milk. 
[02:46:30]  And when the milk comes, you go, hey, my milk is spiraled.  And you throw the milk all over the sushi counter and the ring is in there.  God's fuck.  It's so stupid.  I swear to God.  This show would work though.  The milk is so mad.  The milk is spiraled.  I think that's good.  My milk is spiraled.  And you get all over her slacks. 
[02:47:00]  Of course.  But she doesn't care because she's got that ring.  Mm-hmm.  That was a tender, sweet moment.  It was nice, right?  You like those right in.  Oh, I love it.  I love the whole institution of marriage.  Sure.  Yeah.  How's yours going?  It's great.  Yeah?  It's wonderful.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're still in marital bliss.  Are you?  Mm-hmm.  Not like fucking down the hall.  You talking about Nicole?  No.  Who else would I be talking about?  We have a much, much healthier relationship than Nicole. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  People could be happily married, eh?  I am.  Oh, no.  I understand that.  You weren't happy from day one.  You never even had a chance to even be happy in your marriage.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you were at my wedding.  It was an expression of love and happiness the whole time.  Certainly was.  All right, Sam.  And fucking shitty bartenders, too.  Not good?  Fucking prick.  And fucking too much draftiness on my table.  Goddamn guy was giving me some lip.  Why?  Oh, that's right.  I remember.  Didn't want, you know, fucking proofing my date. 
[02:48:00]  Somebody had a case of big shot-itis.  Somebody got bitten by the big shot bug.  Big shot-itis.  That's rude, proofing his date, Sam.  I know.  I don't have any jurisdiction over the bartenders.  Very rude.  She looked of age, right?  I even tipped the guy.  She looked of age, right?  Yeah.  Right?  What?  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  Well, weren't we in Connecticut? 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  Drink?  I don't know if they're close on there.  Drinking age.  Drinking age.  Yeah.  You're talking.  It was a fun limo ride.  She was close to legal drinking age, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, so?  Yeah.  Why?  What's this?  Oh, what'd you find?  You found Nicolas Cage talking to Jimmy Fallon and not being on a plane.  I did pull it.  Fucking trapping.  Why?  Because this is our new segment called Listener Show Prep. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Oh, you pulled it because it's horrible?  Like this is a complete waste of time?  Huh?  Well, there's a reason why I ignored it and just went to the video you guys asked for.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, this is Listener Show Prep.  All right, so Listener came up with this?  Yeah, because, well, a listener had tweeted that Nicolas Cage was talking with Jimmy Fallon  about an airplane or something.  And, of course, Jimmy was on a plane ride with Nicolas Cage, and Nicolas Cage didn't find 
[02:49:30]  that very fun.  Yeah, Jimmy sat right next to him.  Yeah.  All right, so I understand where this comes from.  Yeah, so Listener Show Prep.  I think this would be good.  Listener Show Prep.  Oh, boy.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you guys are going to like it.  Can we get a stinger?  Listener Show Prep.  Yeah.  Maybe a listener should do it.  Yeah, let a listener make up the fucking stinger for it.  All right, they will.  Oh, this is going to suck, right?  Again, when you said the lame joke that came to mind.  Oh.  Yeah.  Can we get a stinger?  And I wanted to say, we're not bees. 
[02:50:00]  Fucking time.  Here's the Listener's Contribution to today's show.  What happened was Saturday, people went all out.  Oh, do they?  Well, I know it was quiet for me, because I was stuck on an airplane.  Yeah, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah.  But you didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  That would have been fun, though.  Yeah.  I would have liked that.  I think so, absolutely.  I don't, because I would probably bother you.  We'd probably sing some songs together.  Yeah, I would.  Yeah, why not?  I'd have a couple of beverages and then go for it. 
[02:50:30]  Why not?  Do you sing?  Oh, I sing in the shower.  I like it.  I have to say, I like it, because given it in the context of Jimmy, yeah, I like it.  Like, he's talking like if somebody else was next to him, he'd have been fucking the life of the party.  He was up for a good time, if it was Jimmy Fallon.  Right.  Not so much if it's Jimmy Norton.  Here's what he should have said.  That's why I like the clip, absolutely.  Imagine if we were on a plane together.  Yeah, you'd talk to me and I'd ignore you.  Let me hear it one more time.  He thought it would be fun.  There'd be some drinking, maybe some singing. 
[02:51:00]  What happened was Saturday, people went all out.  Oh, do they?  Well, I know it was quiet for me, because I was stuck on an airplane.  Yeah, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  Well, that would have been fun, though.  Yeah.  It would have been fun.  I think so.  I don't know, because I would probably bother you.  We'd probably sing some songs together.  Yeah.  See, you should have went with that.  And he gives the impression he doesn't care if he's going to be bothered.  No, see?  You should have fucking done that, then.  Oh, the Pope wears a bonnie white hat.  Toodly-doo.  The Pope, or I could have said, oh, Nick likes to go to movies and act. 
[02:51:30]  Toodly-doo.  I'm amazed about him.  And you've been, yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  I do.  Oh, Nick had two faces in face-off.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh.  Travolta touched everyone's face and face-off.  Toodly-doo.  Could you imagine?  Oh.  Yes, I did.  Nick's real-ass name is Coppola.  Toodly-doo.  Could you imagine if you actually did this?  Holy shit.  You want to talk about a viral video? 
[02:52:00]  You should have said, fuck you, and then did this.  Yeah.  Oh.  Nick likes to read lots of steps.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh.  Six hours.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  It has to be a six-hour song.  Yeah.  Nick's wearing sunglasses now.  Toodly-doo.  He would have been livid.  You think?  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  Nick just left Las Vegas.  Toodly-doo.  Just every movie he's ever seen in.  Nick is really grody.  Toodly-doo.  Valley girl, man.  Valley girl, very good.  Oh, my God.  That's when the world was introduced to Nicolas Cage.  Yes.  Indeed.  I think.  I don't think he did anything before that, did he?  Oh, he had Fast Times a little very brief moment.  Oh.  Was that cut out, though?  Only TV version, I think.  I think he's in it when they all... 
[02:53:00]  No, he's in there.  He's behind the counter.  In a restaurant.  And, yeah.  Okay.  An All-American burger.  Who was cut out of the movie, but the TV version you see him?  Sean Penn.  Sean Penn.  That's right.  I think he's in more of it.  Yeah.  No, it was Al Pacino.  Oh, was that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First Times.  No shirt, no shoes, no dyes.  Yeah.  No wig, no service.  No lifts, no service. 
[02:53:30]  Flying over to London, jam with the Stones.  Hoo-ah.  Think he would ruin that movie?  All right, Hamilton.  Oh, he would wreck it.  We didn't play the whole crud, the Nicolas Cage thing.  See, he would enjoy someone singing to him on the plane.  What happened was Saturday, people went all out.  Oh, did they?  Well, I know it was quiet for me, because I was stuck on an airplane.  Yeah, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah.  If he didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  Well, that would have been fun.  Can you pause real quick?  Yeah, it would have been fun.  You know, it would have been fun.  I wish that was me sitting there and Fallon would have said that, because Fallon's such 
[02:54:00]  a fun, nice guy.  Yeah.  He was like, yeah, I'm loud on the plane.  Can you play that again?  Pretend I'm the guest on the plane.  Oh.  And me and Jimmy are just joking around.  Right.  All right, hold on.  Let me get, here we go.  All right for me, because I was stuck on an airplane.  Yeah, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah.  If he didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  I hate fucking loud people on the planes.  I don't know.  That's not nice.  I don't think that would...  But just, can you imagine the horror of the audience?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  If you just said that angrily. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, man, they'd be scared, yeah.  You'd hear that low.  Or if you just go back, or if you just wreck the vibe completely by just going the wrong  direction.  Right.  Okay.  Stuck on an airplane.  Yeah, Uwe, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah.  If he didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  Well, I was grieving a death.  Wow.  Just ruin the show.  A downer.  Kind of way I'm ruining this one.  I had to lie on the airplane.  Yeah, Uwe, it was pretty quiet on the airplane, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  If he didn't sit next to me, because normally I'm really loud on the planes.  That would have been fun, though.  Yeah.  I would have been fun.  I think so, absolutely.  Because I would probably bother you.  We'd probably sing some songs together.  Yeah, I would.  Yeah, why not?  I'd have a couple of beverages, and then go,  Why not?  Do you sing?  Oh, I sing in the shower.  I sing in the shower.  I sing in the shower.  My favorite part of that clip is when they said,  Yeah, we could sing some songs together.  You hear one person go,  Oh, really?  Oh, come on.  No, that works, though.  The listener.  I thought it was going to be like a big applause break.  He's lying about that whole plane thing. 
[02:55:30]  He's not fucking, you know, the Mr. Life of the Party.  I know, he's acting like he's fucking, uh,  like he's Stanley Songbird.  But, uh, he was really fucking, uh, quiet.  Guy that can't come up with an analogy.  You didn't get that impression, Jimmy, that he would be, uh, fun and...  Sorry, I don't do impressions.  Guy that pulls out movie references that just aren't funny and don't fit.  Um, no, I didn't get the impression that a song was right around the corner.  No. 
[02:56:00]  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Come on, Nick.  You pick it up.  She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes.  I would hit my arm like this.  And I think, she'll be coming around the mountain when she comes.  Totally do.  You have to have a nervous breakdown one day.  I would love to.  One of these guys would be so fucking funny.  Ah, da-da-da-da-da.  Jesus.  What's, uh, the story about this man born with no penis?  Is this a real fucking story?  Well, he's a producer on a radio show. 
[02:56:30]  Is this real?  Yeah, it's real stuff.  Yeah, it's British.  There used to be a time where you could read silly stories like this in, what, uh, World Weekly News?  Weekly World News?  Weekly World News.  I thought a man born without a penis is a woman.  Right?  Isn't that a chick?  No, he's got testicles.  He's a guy.  Oh.  But he's got a little fucking pecker or something.  He's got a, uh, baby penis.  His bladder was on the outside when he was a baby.  He didn't have to put it back in.  Ours is on the outside, too.  See, outside of the studio.  Our bladder, yes.  Our bladder.  Yes, we have a big penis working.  Oh, what the fuck are you showing us? 
[02:57:00]  What are you doing?  You just put penis in the search?  Make that bigger.  Yeah, Google image.  Which one?  This one?  Yeah.  Open that up.  That's unclipped.  God damn it.  Jesus.  All right, leave that there.  No.  That's a good skinny, far fucking, far skinny head.  I just wanted to clear up what it looked like.  Yeah.  Thanks.  It's like a cock and a diving bell.  Look at the curtains getting closed.  Oh, God, quickly.  God forbid.  Exactly.  Close the curtains.  Yeah.  I want to do a documentary on uncircumcised penises. 
[02:57:30]  A couple long look at that.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you dress like fucking Amelia Earhart.  Fucking interns got the aviator jacket and scarf.  He's got a scarf on his goggles.  Flew in some freckle fucking cream.  God damn it.  I can't look at that shit.  Exactly.  Makes you hungry.  Well, we got a British man born without a penis, and he's set to have one sculpted from  his arm.  He's a security guard. 
[02:58:00]  He beat odds of 20 million to one.  He must be a great fucking security guard, though, because he's so cranky all the time.  Yeah.  Hi, I was just, stop!  What do you mean he's beating odds?  It says beat odds of 20 million to one when he was born with fully functioning testicles  but no manhood.  Is that beating the odds?  Well, yeah.  That would be a curse.  Exactly.  Can't beat anything else.  It beats the odds, his wife.  Everything but his meat. 
[02:58:30]  God, Jimmy does know this story.  With his bladder outside of his body, he underwent surgery to have it moved into its correct position,  but he remained without a penis.  Now, almost four decades later, they're finally going to give this guy a fucking...  Oh, come on.  Well, the surgery wasn't there.  He's not going to know what to do with it.  Native looks set to go under the knife once more to receive his much-needed organ.  Doctors at University College London will try to fold a large flap of skin from his arm,  complete it with its blood vessels and nerves, complete with its blood vessels and nerves, 
[02:59:00]  into a tube to graft onto his pubic area.  Nice.  Wouldn't it be funny if he got a big dick put on and it worked fine,  and then his first night out of the town, he got caught in a fire?  And his head burned?  And he was...  And nobody wanted to fuck him.  Like, his head was just severely burned.  Jesus.  And nobody would go out with him.  Holy fuck. 
[02:59:30]  That was terrible.  Yeah, like he got caught in some sort of a fucking bar fire where his body got out,  but his head got jammed to the door and burned for eight minutes.  And then tried to put it out, but they accidentally threw cookie oil on it.  Exacerbating the problem.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  That is terrible.  So basically, he's getting a penis fucking grown on his arm.  This guy claims to have had sexual relations with more than 100 women,  but his lack of a penis put them off, he added. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  With one punching him in the face and another cheating on him.  Wow.  He took LSD and ecstasy to cope over the years.  Wow, that would be freak out city.  Take some fucking LSD, look down and go, my dick's gone.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's not the...  I don't think that would be the drug of choice if you don't have a fucking penis.  I don't think you want to be on LSD.  Take fucking Valium so you can just sleep.  Yeah.  Dream about it.  Take 100 of them and some booze. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  I'd kill you.  LSD.  Yeah, a little small dick.  Very good.  So they cut off a chunk of his arm, right?  No, they grow it on the arm.  But they cut it out, and then they make it into a tube.  Right.  But leave it connected to his arm?  Yeah.  So it nourishes it.  Would you wear short-sleeved shirts?  So it heals like that.  The blood vessels and all are intact, and then they shove that shit in a tube to continue growing.  Oh, yeah.  So they probably shove it in a tube while it's still on his arm, connected.  Great.  I think they form it into a tube. 
[03:01:00]  They cut his arm.  Yeah.  But it's still, you know, attached somewhere, so it's getting nourishment.  And then they put the part they cut in a tube, I'm assuming, and keep it kind of all on the arm until it kind of grows together and all that.  I think they sew it into a round tube and then leave it.  I heard they're putting it in a tube so it kind of grows.  I heard they make it a tube.  They make a tube out of her.  Well, whatever they do, it's going to be a disaster.  We could all agree on that.  I think they make a tube out of it and leave it connected with the veins and stuff so it gets blood while it heals. 
[03:01:30]  I hope they make them a large one.  What is that?  The skin is rolled?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Large flap of forearm skin?  It's only made of skin?  Yes.  It's rolled up skin like a Swiss roll?  Yeah.  What's your penis made out of?  I don't know, but there's something inside other than just skin.  Hold on, hold on.  The shit about the men?  Hold on.  Doctors at University College London, this is what they say.  Yeah.  We'll try to fold a large flap of skin from his arm, okay?  Complete with its blood vessels and nerves, okay? 
[03:02:00]  Into a tube to graft onto the pubic area.  So they roll it into a tube.  They don't put it into a tube.  They're rolling the skin into a tube.  It does read the other way a little bit, doesn't it?  Where then into a tube?  I don't think they put it in a tube, though.  I think you're right, though.  You are right.  They roll it into a tube.  Wouldn't it be awkward if the only way it heals is in another man's asshole so he's got to walk around for a while behind some man with his new dick in his head?  Would you do that knowing that you would have a dick in the end?  You'd have to.  Well, it's the nourishment of the man's ass. 
[03:02:30]  You don't have to question who do you get, what guy do you get to volunteer?  Wow, that's fucked up because I thought they got some meat, like some fucking muscle and meat from the arm, but they just are taking just skin and rolling it up like a yodel.  How does it get hard for sex?  Pump.  It's probably fucking...  Why don't you just use the pumpy thing?  The pumpy thing.  This is so fucked up.  And then they cut it off and joined to the testicles. 
[03:03:00]  He's just got ball bags, just balls hanging there.  How silly must that look?  Fucking...  It's fucking hard.  It looks like...  It just, like, with the little dent of the screw, it just looks like a fleshy tooth.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  He's just got balls hanging there.  Big stupid nuts hanging down with no dick.  Balls look silly without a dick companion.  They look idiotic. 
[03:03:30]  Balls are idiotic.  Let's see.  Dr. Steve is checking in.  They'll, uh, put an implant into the meat tube so he can get an erection of sorts.  Okay.  So they put a...  All right, so they keep it hollow.  They put, like, a pump device.  Yeah, they keep it hollow so they can put the pump device in the middle.  Can you use the posty vac?  Posty vac.  No, you're worried.  Why don't we miss out on the best part of life when you can have life with the posty vac?  Is that company in trouble? 
[03:04:00]  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Well, they said that insurance will cover it.  And they've been submitting, like, all kinds of, uh, erroneous claims to insurance companies.  And, um, yeah.  They're in some kind of trouble.  I still see the commercials, though, so you could still, you know, jack your penis up with the old posty vac penis pump.  Crazy.  Posty vac.  How embarrassing.  And they show the woman making the bed after sex in the background. 
[03:04:30]  It's kind of a soft blur shot.  Because in the pure focus foreground is the posty vac on the night table.  So it's there.  And the woman's making the bed like she just had a great time with her fucking hubby who has to pump his fucking football dick up.  What they don't show is her putting crushed glass in his pillow.  Hoping he fucking breathes it in and chokes.  Oh, my God. 
[03:05:00]  That's terrible.  Stupid.  Positive.  Can we do a quick break and then finish the show?  Let's do that.  I have one plug.  I'm game for it.  No.  I'm doing a benefit tonight.  For Mr. Kite?  There will be a show tonight.  Are you going to be on trampoline?  No.  Will the Hendersons be there?  No.  What a scene.  From what?  And tonight, Mr. Kite. 
[03:05:30]  I don't know what you're talking about.  For the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on trampoline.  That's the Beatles.  Yes, the Beatles.  Oh.  I did not recognize it.  I was thinking of Tommy.  It's from Sgt. Pepper.  Very good.  Can we play that now?  Sgt. Pepper.  Do you know that one, Jimmy?  I do not.  I don't know that song.  Let's play that one.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's rare.  Where are you?  This is good.  I like this. 
[03:06:00]  What's the name of the actual song?  I think it's for the benefit of Mr. Kite.  No.  No?  E-Rock?  That's what I thought, too.  What is it?  I thought it was Mr. Kite.  For the benefit of Mr. Kite.  Oh, come on.  Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite.  Double track vocal from John.  What is this? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, God.  What is this?  What is this?  Ringo on his cymbals.  Oh, that's good.  The fuck is this?  And now in come the whirly hits.  This is a track with all the little sounds on it.  The melange of...  It's like melange.  It's like they're picking it apart. 
[03:07:00]  This still has more views than the Sirius XM.  Oh, of course it does.  And along with that is the little tootie backing on this track.  Oh.  Track four.  Oh, you've got no low end on this.  That's it.  Spend your time.  He's got a deep breath.  There's a lot of shit going on in that song. 
[03:07:30]  Wait, you're not a big Beatles fan.  So how do you know the words to the song?  I'm a huge Beatles fan.  I love the Beatles.  What's your favorite Beatles song?  I don't know.  There's so many. 
[03:08:00]  I Am the Walrus?  No.  I don't like the ones that are a little too wacky like that.  And the old ones are quaint, but not like...  You know, you get some good Abbey Road shit.  That's good.  Oh.  To the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on Trampoline.  Boom.  Boom.  The Hendersons will all be there.  Later, Pablo Bank is there. 
[03:08:30]  What a scene.  Yes, Jim.  Over men and horses, hoops and garners.  Lastly, through a hob's head of real fire.  You know what my favorite Beatles song is?  What?  Head full of...  Head full of gook.  This is me.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  Gook.  Don't be late. 
[03:09:00]  Let this K and H is sure to fuck you.  Ha, ha.  This is terrible.  Head full of gook.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Ha, ha, ha.  I look at my head and I see that it's leaking.  Still, my wife gently weeps.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:09:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Did it, it, it, did it.  Yeah.  All right.  Without a sound.  Fucking Sergeant Peppers, man.  Can I go out on a limb and say it's a pretty good album?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I'm putting myself out there, but...  No.  A little bit.  It's a popular album.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Kites is topping the Bills. 
[03:10:00]  I can do that.  I rule.  I'm playing with the Beatles.  I'm the fifth Beatle. 
[03:10:30]  Crazy.  All right.  I guess we can turn this fucking shit off, please.  Let's go to Lisa.  Lisa.  Lisa, Rhode Island.  Lisa.  Lisa what?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I'd rather buy.  Lisa.  That's good.  Yes.  I guess.  I guess my husband just told me that this guy that he works with, he got some kind of weird  infection and it affected his penis.  Uh-oh.  He said, my husband said it exploded, but I guess it kind of burst.  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  Something like that.  It must have split in half.  I don't know what.  God.  But he's actually having surgery and they're taking the excess skin from his neck.  Old dick neck.  I can't.  Old neck dick.  That's what we were saying.  He said he should take it from his lips.  Then he could have a lip dick instead of a lip dick.  Wait, what did you say?  We didn't hear you.  Oh, a lip.  He should take the skin from his lip.  Yes.  Your phone is cutting out.  I'm sorry.  I hear taking the skin.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Something about a lip or what?  Yeah.  Lip dick.  What do you mean?  Take the skin from his lip instead of his neck.  But why would he use lipstick?  I don't understand because the lipstick is not.  No.  Could you start over?  Yeah.  Your phone is really.  Your phone is cutting in and out.  It's frustrating.  It seems like it's working now, though.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  We're saying that it'd be funny if they took the skin from his lip.  So instead of lip dick, he would be lip dick. 
[03:12:00]  No, not funny?  You're purposely not doing the punchline.  No.  Your phone is crapping out constantly.  Are you hitting a mute button?  Are you hitting a mute button?  No, not at all.  I'm not hitting anything.  What road are you on?  I am?  What road are you on?  Are you in your car?  Yeah.  I am in my car.  Oh, wait.  It's good now.  We apologize, but one more time because we didn't hear it. 
[03:12:30]  Hold on.  Jimmy needs to clear his throat for a second.  Hold on.  Take a sip of water, Jim.  Yeah, if you could, one more time, please.  We're sorry.  Okay.  We said it would be very funny if they took the skin.  We heard you!  Oh!  Jim, can you come to profit?  Fuck for skin, come to profit.  Oh, did he wind up for that one?  Oh, boy, did he.  I know. 
[03:13:00]  He might have thrown out his fucking back on that one.  Oh, God damn it.  That is so funny.  He takes a sip of water.  It's all red.  Me, me, me, me, me.  All right.  Well, that was terrific.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  All right.  Have a good day.  The benefit for this evening is for my friend, Mary, who has cancer, and we are doing a benefit. 
[03:13:30]  A lot of the comedians.  It's tonight at 8 o'clock.  Doors open at 7 at the Village Underground.  It's right around the corner from the Comedy Cellar.  It's a little bit larger than the cellar.  And it's going to be myself.  It's Colin.  It's Amy Schumer.  It's a comedian named Michael Che.  It's Bobby Kelly.  Jesus.  Wow.  It's a very, very good show.  Wow.  Tickets are only, I think, 20 bucks.  And it's for a very good cause.  And it's a great place to see a show.  We're all doing sets. 
[03:14:00]  Mary's been a friend of ours for many years.  That's a pretty bang-up lineup you got there this evening.  Yeah.  Village Underground.  I don't know exactly.  Just go to the website.  It's pretty.  It's on West 3rd Street between McDougal and 6th Avenue.  Hi, McDougal.  Hi.  Don't channel.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, then?  All right.  Let's do that.  This is Open Anticipation.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:14:30]  The interns are in here being affectionate.  They were just calling each other babe a minute ago.  What?  I don't know.  What?  They like each other.  It's cool.  It's a nice camaraderie.  So after Open Anticipation Live, they were trying to figure out who took something with  the headphones or something.  And I said, you need to get a gumshoe on it.  And one of the interns said, like, Ross Perot.  Which I don't understand. 
[03:15:00]  Eric, are they teaching something different in schools now?  I didn't know gumshoe meant politicians.  I don't know what Ross Perot would have to do with finding anything.  It's your fault.  Nobody uses the term gumshoe anymore.  Well, I was just being, like, clever, I thought.  But I guess I really didn't get the Ross Perot reference.  You've got to dumb it down for the kids.  You're too sophisticated.  Was Ross Perot at any point a detective?  No.  He wasn't.  He was an oil tycoon, I think, or something like that.  But never, like, he didn't make his millions being an extremely successful private eye? 
[03:15:30]  Not to my knowledge.  I don't think so either.  We would have found that out when he was running for president.  Maybe he made sure we didn't.  That's how good of a private eye he is.  He would have, you would have had to hire him to find out what a great private eye he was.  Wow.  You know who, kid, who was just texting me?  He's working on an Opie and Anthony show mixtape.  Right.  Not, like, with bits, like a hip-hop mixtape, but it's hosted by Opie and Anthony and Jim and me.  Okay.  And he's shouting everybody out and everything. 
[03:16:00]  He was texting me last night, making sure that he got everybody's names on it.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, so I think he's going to have a bunch of them to give away at some point.  Are we going to see, like, hundreds of them laying around the bathroom on Monday morning?  Promo items.  2-1-5, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Same.  How are you going?  Good.  Mike out of Philly, I'm the guy who wouldn't shut up yesterday.  Nobody screened me.  I wanted to just get on.  I wanted to send you an ID on the DJ thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:16:30]  Well, we were saying yesterday, and now it looks like Opie and Anthony are going to take it.  It's going straight to the land of opportunity where they're going to have Denny and DJ Who Kid and DJ Troy Kwan  all having a DJ off.  Not to necessarily see who's better, because as we learned yesterday, with DJing, it's not a competition.  Just to kind of point out the way everybody does their styles differently.  All right, Sam.  I love it.  Why can't we get some listeners involved?  Because nobody knows who the listeners are. 
[03:17:00]  I know, but I think...  People are invested in Denny.  People are invested in Who Kid.  People are invested in Troy.  But nobody's invested in, like, hey, I'm a listener who also happens to be a DJ.  Even technology didn't like the idea.  It turned his phone off.  Thank God.  Yesterday, he just yap, yap, yap.  Roland, you're a genius.  All right.  Shit happens.  What do you mean shit happens?  My genius comes and goes.  Oh. 
[03:17:30]  Lingerie pictures, huh?  They said no twice for her, and I just, like, sat there and just Googled Maximum and her name.  I figured...  Maximum?  Maximum?  Is that the magazine?  Maximum Magazine.  It's the magazine with the most pages of any magazine.  Yeah.  So I just typed her name, and boom.  It has so many pictures, so many articles.  It's the maximum amount.  Yes.  Maximum Magazine.  That's all they could put in.  They put in as much as humanly possible.  Is that right, Roland?  No, we read your articles, just the pictures.  So you are now, when they say no to female celebrities, you're... 
[03:18:00]  Even males.  I'm going to do both.  You're going to just see.  Maybe we can get some sexy pictures of the guys.  Yeah.  Just like, hey, look at this.  He has a big shlong.  Ooh.  That's a talking point, right?  Yeah.  Why not?  You have a big peepee.  Grant in Montana.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  Good, Grant.  Hey, I just wanted to say Friday's show was brilliant.  Yeah.  The after show was brilliant.  Wow.  I didn't listen to Ron and Fez, but, you know, I've been trying to get through. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know what the interns are doing.  I've been hung up on so many fucking times.  Well, maybe they didn't like you.  Well, probably not.  All I wanted to do was just tell Eric, thank you for the Halo 4 game.  His first Saturday night show.  You know how long...  All right, all right, all right.  Enough of that.  Did you give him a Halo game?  I mean, I had to hang up with him.  No wonder the interns wouldn't let him through.  If you want to just call in and compliment somebody, you've got to do it quick, because 
[03:19:00]  we can't just keep you on like Larry and have you go on and on and on.  No, no, Sam.  They've got to set it up.  Oh, oh, I see.  When it's an E-Rock compliment, they can take their time.  No, same for you.  They tend to, though.  Larry takes a while when he calls you.  He does.  Well, that's what I said.  There's one Larry.  He's got to give you a build-up.  Yeah.  But I like the other guy.  Sam, love you.  Love this show.  You're a genius.  And then he moves on.  Then you move on to the next thing.  Yeah.  Then you're like, Roland's a genius for bringing it.  So they're saying no to guests.  And then you're being like, well, I'm not going to take that as a no.  I'm not going to take that sitting down. 
[03:19:30]  That's not going to be a no.  That's going to be a no to the guest who's in this picture.  Yes.  But if we find another picture, they might say yes to it.  It's still open.  Recommendo.  Max in Oklahoma City.  Hey, what's going on, Sam?  You're doing a great job, buddy.  Thank you.  I've got to get an idea for your DJ contest.  Okay.  These guys really want to prove how good they are or whatever.  Have them do genres they're not real familiar with, like country. 
[03:20:00]  Have a Who Kid do like country or something or do like all three of them do country first  and then death metal or something and then whatever they're good at.  I mean, it's not a bad idea to mix things up a little bit, Max.  But the thing is, we heard it from Denny yesterday.  He said, no, I do something different.  You do what you do.  Yeah.  You do what you do.  The ones with the twos.  So we've got to make them in their element.  We have to display what that element is.  I mean, that's the whole attraction.  You've got Who Kid, who's a hip-hop DJ. 
[03:20:30]  You have Troy Kwan, who's a club DJ.  You know what you just did?  You did like a reality show, like The Stars.  What do you mean?  Like the Dance with the Stars reality show.  You did like a little DJ reality show.  How is that?  You've got the three best, different eras.  Right, the three best DJs there are, you put them together.  Yeah, one from a different era.  Right.  Different hip-hop, and then you've got Troy.  So you're telling me Troy Kwan is the best club DJ there is?  Yeah.  DJ Who Kid is the best hip-hop DJ there is?  The Tory now, yeah.  And Denny?  Denny is the best mobile DJ there is? 
[03:21:00]  Back in the 50s.  I don't know if Denny was actually performing in the 50s.  He probably was.  He probably.  What's up?  Do you think they have to do something where they've got to keep the flow going?  Like Troy will start it off, he'll spin one of his favorite songs, and then Who Kid's  listening to it, and Troy will cue him when the song's about to end.  Well, I see what you're saying.  Who Kid matches it and goes into something with him, and then he's got to pass it off to  Denny?  We'll probably just have the one set up, because we don't have a giant studio that can fit  three DJ booths in it, but with that said, yeah, maybe they put on a song, they mix 
[03:21:30]  it, and then they step out while the song is still playing, and we have to go into the  next one.  Right, right there.  That's where the elements combine.  That's why I see a fishbowl event.  Maybe we do a fishbowl event.  All I'm picturing is Troy spinning whatever the hottest club song is right now, and then  Who Kid's spinning the biggest hip-hop song or something that'll really get the crowd  moving right now.  Right, so Troy is going with Macklemore, right, into Who Kid, who throws Trinidad James on 
[03:22:00]  for us.  Okay, and then it goes into Denny, and you're hearing this.  I keep on dancing.  Hey, it's Denny.  I know you guys are liking the hip-hop, but there's no reason we can't squeeze in a little  room for the rock.  Hopefully, Opie and Anthony lose interest in it before the bit happens, which they've done  many, many times before, and we can do an after show from the fishbowl. 
[03:22:30]  The O&A will be done in this studio, and then we'll just do the after show in the fishbowl.  Or do what they do.  Every time they do an event, they bring the club kids in so they could dance and judge.  Yeah, and then the club kids are just like, what?  What are they playing?  Kokomo?  And Roland should bring in somebody to cook for us.  That's easy.  That's two seconds.  We were talking...  Oh, wait.  Let me go to...  Before I move on.  Robert in Birmingham.  Yeah, hey, Sam.  Hey, man.  I love you, but you're a fucking moron. 
[03:23:00]  Ross Perot was not a detective.  Hercule Poirot is the famous detective from the Agatha Christie novels.  All right.  Well, don't say I'm a moron.  I'm not the one who said Ross Perot.  The intern was.  You got to listen to every word.  The intern was in here going, oh, a detective.  We need to get Ross Perot on the case.  And I go, what?  What are you talking about?  I thought that's what your gumption referred to.  Sorry about...  No, these kids.  John Sally gave Who Kid a shout out on Artie Lang's TV show the other night.  What did he say? 
[03:23:30]  He was just going to a Jay-Z party.  He left Artie's.  And he said, yeah, my buddy Who Kid's going to be spinning records.  Who Kid is everybody's buddy.  Thanks, Robert.  All right, later.  He knows how to get around.  He knows how to get around.  The problem is that he's going from spot to spot.  And it's like, how do you stay looking fly?  Because a DJ...  And you can ask Troy.  You can even ask Denny.  Denny comes in here looking like a million bucks.  Because a DJ needs to look good. 
[03:24:00]  And Who Kid is going across this city, across the nations.  How does he keep looking great?  You know what I mean?  And the thing is...  Huh?  The moisture.  It may be a little bit of moisture.  But he's only making a DJ's salary.  Your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle.  You know what I mean?  If you want to keep your face trim looking smooth, it doesn't need a vibrating handle.  It doesn't need a back scratcher.  It doesn't need ten blades.  Seriously.  Roland, have you noticed the price you pay for new razor blades?  Too much. 
[03:24:30]  How much?  Fifteen dollars.  Is that in pesos?  And you're doing this every month for the rest of your life?  This.  Every week.  Yeah, you're a hairy guy, aren't you?  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment, Roland.  For the hairiest of hairy, this is it.

I was walking through the Palisades Mall on Saturday night.  Jess wants to get a cupcake.  We don't have any cash.  We find five dollars on the floor.  It's cupcake time.  What's the moral of the story?  Found money is delicious.  Or your sheep.  And that's what this is like.  It's like found delicious money. 
[03:25:30]  All this guy's want is a great shave without shelling out 20 bucks month after month, regardless  of what currency it's in.  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do this.

Speaking of those guys, Eric, did you get any feedback?  Do you know you did a Dollar Shave Club read for O&A while you were drunk?  Was it that or was it mask?  No, you did a mask read at the end of the show, but then in the middle of the whole thing  you did a Dollar Shave Club read. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  No.  I knew the mask one.  I didn't know I did Dollar Shave Club.  I just wanted to know if there was any feedback on that or...  Oh, wait, you're right.  Mask I read off your computer, right?  Right, right, right.  And the Dollar Shave Club, I had the copy.  All right, I did, yeah.  Or did you hear...  I know you know people in the sales department.  Did Dollar Shave Club respond at all to the fact that Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank said  that their business model wouldn't work?  I don't know if they sent them that one.  Why?  It was a celebrity endorsement, almost, kind of. 
[03:27:00]  No, it was a celebrity interaction.  Right.  It was not an endorsement.  In fact, it was shitting on the company.  No, he wasn't shitting on the company.  He was shitting on the company as if it was a potential company.  He didn't realize it already was working.  So he was in character.  He was in character.  Okay, then that's how we'll send him.  Like Mr. Imus, you know.  He does characters.  Characters.  Speaking of characters.  Oh, you know what?  I wanted to...  The intern.  Send Alan Thicke in here.  All right, go. 
[03:27:30]  The kid that looks like the guy from the Free Credit Report commercial.  Is that what you think he looks like?  When he doesn't shave, he looks like that.  Who's the guy from the Free Credit Report commercial?  The guy who sings those horrible songs, but he's not really singing.  Can you sing the Free Credit commercial, please?  I want to see if I can picture it.  You know how it goes.  Just go for it, Alan.  FreeCreditReport.com.  I see it.  I see what you're talking about, Eric.  I see exactly what you're talking about.  I don't.  What the fuck is talking about?  You come from a long line. 
[03:28:00]  You know, Alan Thicke.  Everybody thinks, oh, the guy from Growing Pains.  No.  He wrote and performed a good number of TV theme songs.  And you Linger Longer, Opie and Anthony fans, know that I know a great deal of TV theme  songs.  You remember that bit, Eric?  Yes.  When I was sitting there just rattling off TV theme songs?  I remember where they made you stand in the corner singing different strokes on a separate  mic while Gary Coleman came in.  You know, I did that, Alan.  I didn't have to find that.  Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman did the show once, and I couldn't look at him, so I just stared, looking in 
[03:28:30]  the corner, and while Gary Coleman walked into the room, I was loudly singing, well, the  world don't move to the beat of just one drum, and the whole theme song.  And they talked to him as if it wasn't happening.  And at some point, if you could find that bit, Eric, Gary Coleman did express his anger  towards me.  He wasn't happy.  He's not a very pleasant guy.  Well, no, he's dead.  He's dead.  He's dead.  He's specifically not pleasant.  He doesn't hold up his side of a conversation at all anymore. 
[03:29:00]  Oh.  But yeah, you know, Alan Thicke, the original Alan Thicke, you're Alan Thicke Jr.  Right.  He was Mr. TV theme song.  Are you a guy who loves TV theme songs?  Yeah, but I mean, I grew up in the, well, I was a little kid in the 90s.  That's when I watched most of my TV.  Charles in Charge, Full House?  Those are past him.  Yeah.  Step by Step?  Nah, it's 90s.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, Auntie Carol, Cousin Cody.  You know what I'm saying.  I was watching Nickelodeon. 
[03:29:30]  Like, I don't think, I don't think those were.  My Brother and Me?  You remember that show, My Brother and Me, Eric?  No, I don't know that one.  That was a good-ass show.  Oh, wait, no.  I was thinking about the show with the two red-headed kids.  Pete and Pete.  Pete and Pete.  You want to know who's, uh, you want, I'm going to tell you this, Alan.  You're going to be impressed.  Sit back and listen to this.  You're going to be impressed, Alan Thicke Jr.  A couple of weeks ago, I was down at Wendy's with some co-workers, and I got a phone call  from Liam up here from Talent Booking, and he said, hey, Sam, where are you? 
[03:30:00]  And I go, I'm down at lunch.  I'll be back up in like 20 minutes.  And he goes, oh, there's somebody here who wanted to say hi to you.  I go, who's that?  You know who it was?  Pete?  Little Pete.  Danny Tamberelli.  Nice.  He wanted to be like, what's up?  He's a buddy of mine.  We talk on Twitter all the time.  Really?  Yeah, that's right.  You impressed?  Can you introduce me?  Well, we'll see.  I don't know you well enough yet.  Does he still have the tattoo on his arm?  Petunia?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Did you see the Funny or Die Pete and Pete reunion?  No.  Look it up.  It's funny, because Pete, like, Big Pete, is a normal, rational, well-developed person, 
[03:30:30]  and Little Pete in the video is just a complete degenerate who has not let go of Pete and Pete.  Is that like a Danny Bonaduce kind of thing?  I don't know.  But Danny Tamberelli, I prefer Danny Tamberelli to Danny Bonaduce.  But I will say this.  What's up with all you redheads naming your kids Danny?  Don't do it anymore.  It's been done.  You know?  Retire it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No redhead should be named Danny anymore.  Or Dave.  Eastside Dave has cornered the market on that. 
[03:31:00]  Danny's have been done.  So have Dave's.  Move on to the next thing.  But what I was going to say was, I was also, I mean, I interacted with Danny Tamberelli when I was a kid.  Did you know I was on a Nickelodeon game show called Figure It Out?  No way.  That's true.  No.  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  How'd you score that?  Because I flicked quarters off my ankle and I sent a tape of it and then they brought me on the show.  Wow.  That's right.  And I mean, they usually had like kids do like crappy stunts.  Like, you know, I can. 
[03:31:30]  Oh my God.  Alan Thicke Jr.  You know what the girl before me on that show did?  What?  She invented edible taco tape.  Terrible.  Horrible.  It was like, you know, you wrap up a soft taco.  Yeah.  And her tape was something that you'd put on it.  But I'm watching them film it and they have to do 150 takes because she keeps wrapping up the tacos, putting her tape on,  and then the moment she takes her hands away, the tacos just completely open up again.  Horrible invention.  I didn't even know what she was doing on that show.  So, me, on the other hand, I had a great stunt. 
[03:32:00]  Summer Sanders was all putting her hands on my shoulders.  Lori Beth Denberg was like, holy shit.  And I was like, you are a big girl, Lori Beth.  Was Summer Sanders also on Double Dare?  No.  No?  That was before.  I mean, Summer Sanders, she was big after Double Dare.  Oh.  Yeah, she was still swimming when Double Dare was on.  I thought she was the girl that helped Mark Summers out.  No, you're thinking of Vanna White.  Wow.  Bill in Delaware.  Samuel, if I could insert myself.  Listen to the Pete and Pete story. 
[03:32:30]  Please do.  Um, I used to take karate classes with Mr. Cambarelli in the late 80s in Maywood, New Jersey.  In the late 80s?  So, like, when he was, like, when he was a kid?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I was in second grade.  Um, he was probably a year or two younger than me.  Oh.  And, um, as a bonus, the girl in the show, Allison Finnelli, she played Ellen.  She is my cousin.  What?  How are you disconnected to Pete and Pete?  I have a, I don't know.  I just happen to be connected to Pete and Pete.  Your cousin is Ellen?  Yes.  What's she up to? 
[03:33:00]  She's a doctor down in Philadelphia.  What?  Why wouldn't she keep acting?  I have no idea.  If I went to the doctor and it was Ellen from Pete and Pete, I'd be like, first, I'd be like,  holy shit, you're Ellen from Pete and Pete.  And then I'd be like, I do not trust you with my medical needs.  You're Ellen from Pete and Pete.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Or you can say, check me for a hernia.  Huh?  Or check me for a hernia.  Exactly.  Pete and Pete was a cool show for kids.  Yeah.  Like, when you look back, it was very, uh, it was kind of cutting edge. 
[03:33:30]  It had cool music.  Michael Stipe was on one episode or a couple episodes.  California Dreams was cool.  California Dreams was not cool.  That was just something to put on after Saved by the Bell.  Yeah, California Dreams was the opposite of cool.  California Dreams was as cool as City Guys was.  You remember City Guys, Eric?  No.  You remember City Guys?  I remember Guys Next Door.  I didn't know that one.  That was another show they tried to put on after Saved by the Bell.  It was just the Saved by the Bell block.  It was all the same producers.  Just, like, throw five other people.  Peter Eagle just said four kids. 
[03:34:00]  But Pete and Pete was weird.  Yeah, exactly.  Pete and Pete was weird.  It always had this sort of, like, uh, cool indie vibe happening.  But it was a kid's show.  Right.  I mean, I think there was a lot of humor in that show that I just didn't understand when  I was a little kid.  Like, the whole thing was, like, we'll go for it.  The fact that he had a piece of cereal shaped like Martin Van Buren shoved up his nose for  an entire episode, that's fucking genius.  I don't care how old you are.  It's hilarious.  There aren't any shows like that.  Like, when you turn on Nickelodeon now, you're just a bunch of kids overacting and being 
[03:34:30]  rude to adults.  Like, that's the whole premise for every show.  I like the episodes where they didn't have anything planned for, uh, Arnie, the world's  strongest man.  Right.  Artie.  Artie.  Not Arnie.  And so he'd walk away, like, Pete and Pete would walk away from the scene, and you'd  just see him in the back, just standing in the park looking awkward, flipping around  doing nothing.  He was just there for no reason.  He had no life.  Did you know it blew my mind when I was watching Seinfeld and I saw The Wiz and somebody  told me that was Artie, the world's strongest man, the strongest man in the world? 
[03:35:00]  I was like, what?  You ever see The Wiz on Seinfeld?  I've never seen The Wiz.  Artie looks totally different.  You remember when he played The Wiz, right, Eric?  Yeah.  You know what else he did, too, was, um, in the 90s on MTV, they used to do these little,  um, bumpers between the music and stuff, and they had a guy that was singing, like, Frank  Sinatra, but he was singing the modern-day alternative songs.  They just called him the chairman of the board.  Uh-huh.  And that was Artie?  And he was singing Pearl Jam and Cypress Hill and all this stuff.  You know who my favorite MTV vignette guy was of that era? 
[03:35:30]  It was the guy...  Jimmy the Cab Driver?  Yeah, who ended up being on Grounded for Life.  Yeah.  And you know...  He gained a lot of weight, huh?  Yeah, he did.  Donald Logue is Jimmy the Cab Driver.  Yeah, that's his name, Donald Logue.  He's hilarious.  And they're doing...  My buddy, they're doing a secret project.  He's going to come back soon.  Donald...  What's his name?  Jimmy the Cab Driver?  Jimmy the Cab Driver's coming back?  Yeah, with a big-time director.  They're doing the whole thing with him.  For the internet or for MTV?  For a movie.  Wow.  I wonder if there's anybody around except for me, Eric, and you who remember who he is. 
[03:36:00]  There's a lot of people because at parties, they always ask them,  where are you going to bring it back?  Really?  Yeah, and he has a bunch of unreleased stuff that I'm getting soon.  Was it his character or did MTV invent it?  That's his character.  Really?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, and I remember when he did his ironic video.  When he did the parody of the ironic video.  He says, it's like meeting the girl of your dreams and finding out she's only seven years old.  I always thought that was funny when I was kidding.  It was all shot in his cab, right?  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  In two corners?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll bring you the unreleased DVD stuff.  It's hilarious.  Please do.  The shit that he does.  What else started as an MTV vignette that actually...  Because Pete and Pete started as Nickelodeon vignettes.  That's when people used to be creative on TV.  Like, they actually used to do shit.  No Control with Colin was there.  Yeah, but I mean that...  That was its own feature.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's a little before my time.  That show was on in like 85, wasn't it?  Dennis Leary.  Yeah, Dennis Leary.  He started in the late 80s into 90.  Yeah.  Doing the Cindy Crawford stuff. 
[03:37:00]  So what was your sitcom when you were a kid?  Alan, you're a little younger than us.  Oh, well...  I mean, I watched a ton of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Sure.  I mean, like, that was great.  I mean...  You know, I remember...  I'm going to tell you this, Alan Thicke Jr.  I remember a time when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was on...  And it was new episodes.  That's how old I am.  I remember...  Do you remember that, Eric?  Monday nights at 8.  Monday nights at 8.  I remember watching the last episode and being like,  Oh my God, what am I going to do Monday nights at 8?  Thank God Raw is three hours now.  The show that was constantly being new for me, 
[03:37:30]  the one that I was always waiting for every Thursday,  was that 70s show.  Really?  Yeah.  You love it.  Well, not anymore.  I look back to it now,  and I think that show kind of sucks.  I mean, I find a lot of the humor...  Yeah.  You like Fez in that show?  Nah.  Not Fez from Runners.  Who do you like in that show?  Is Alan Kelso?  Alan.  I've actually been compared to him a couple of times.  I don't know.  People...  What?  Do I really come off as a Kelso?  Yes.  What?  You think he's more... 
[03:38:00]  I was thinking more like Eric.  Eric, what's his name?  Foreman?  Yeah.  No, I don't think he's Eric Foreman.  You think he's Kelso?  You mean because he's a bit of a himbo?  A bit.  Yeah.  You think so, Roland?  He'll be Murdoch from the A-Team.  Joe in Georgia.  Hello, Samuel.  Hello, Joe.  Trying to think of a name of a sitcom that I watched back in the 90s.  You might can help with it.  It was about these American kids, but they were in a school overseas. 
[03:38:30]  It was like England or something like that.  But to come on Saturday mornings, it was early 90s or maybe late 80s, but I've been trying  to think of the name of it for a while.  That does not ring a bell unless it's Saved by the Bell when they were hanging out at the  beach resort.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No, that's a negative.  That was the start of Leah Romini, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Stacey Carosi.  Exactly.  So, it was American kids hanging out at a British school?  Yes. 
[03:39:00]  They wore uniforms at school and everything, but they were like really smart kids, and  they were at the school overseas.  And the girl that's in the original, the first Cabin Fever, the hot chick, she was in  it.  I remember.  You're thinking of Boy Meets World.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you very much.  Problem solved.  Thank you.  You know what the craziest thing about Boy Meets World is that I just realized the other  day?  Wonder Years is on Netflix, so I watch it all the time. 
[03:39:30]  I love Wonder Years.  You know the kid who plays, the scrawny kid who plays Frankie the Rat next to Ethan Supply  in Boy Meets World?  Remember he had like the long hair?  In the high school years.  Wiggly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was also in the Wonder Years.  Both Savage Brothers shows.  He was in both of them.  Same producers?  I don't know, dude.  Freaked me out.  So, you were a Fresh Prince fan?  What else did you like?  What Nickelodeon shows did you like?  Oh, uh, Welcome Freshman. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, I remember that show.  I hated that show.  Yeah, because there were, how long did it take until you found out they were all Canadian?  Yeah, I didn't know.  I was a little kid when that show came out.  I didn't even get any of it.  I didn't even know what a Freshman was.  I hated it.  Hated it.  The Merv Cam.  I like Parker Lewis Can't Lose.  Oh, yeah.  All Real Monsters.  Oh, I remember that show.  I mean, yeah.  Did you like it?  You're the cartoon guy, Eric.  No, it's a shitty Saturday morning.  They made a toy and then made the cartoon after.  You think so?  I think that's what it is.  No integrity?  No.  You need a little integrity in your cartoons. 
[03:40:30]  No.  I love Fraggle Rock.  You were a Fraggle Rock guy?  What?  Yeah.  Fraggle Rock was the shit.  That's the 80s.  I didn't like Fraggle Rock at all.  It was on HBO.  Yeah, it was.  It was?  It was originally an HBO show.  Huh.  Yeah.  Maybe I kid stuff on HBO.  You're probably too young for that, Alan Thicke Jr.  I've seen Fraggle Rock.  You have?  Yeah, but I mean, it's one thing to experience it when it's part of the cultural lexicon.  Oh, well.  It's another thing to go back and watch it.  Like, for instance, I don't think Denver, The Last Dinosaur, would hold up.  But when I was a kid, that dinosaur that had a guitar and a leather jacket was the fucking 
[03:41:00]  coolest thing I'd ever seen in my life.  And he's your friend and a whole lot more.  Exactly, Eric.  Sorry.  No, I was just trying to think.  Wasn't there, like, a...  He had a bit of a Kelso moment there.  He just blew his mind.  Yeah.  No, I was thinking, wasn't there, like, a show that had, like, dinosaurs, but it was,  like, that one John Goodman show?  Roseanne?  It was, like, a rip-off of Roseanne.  You know what the show was called?  What was it?  Dinosaurs.  That's the name of the show.  It was a rip-off of the Honeymooners.  Or was it?  Every show is a...  I mean, but Roseanne's a rip-off of the Honeymooners. 
[03:41:30]  They're all the Honeymooners.  You know?  But, yeah, yeah, I guess...  Yeah, it was dinosaurs.  Oh.  Not the mama.  I'm the baby.  I'm the baby, gotta love me.  That got annoying quick, didn't it?  Yeah, because they made a music video.  They did everything that, uh...  I mean, sort of the Simpsons.  Yeah, well, that was annoying, too.  But the...  Because the first year took off and the baby had catchphrases, they made a music video.  Yeah.  Of the dinosaurs.  And then they made toys, and then they made...  And that killed it.  Kurt in Pittsburgh. 
[03:42:00]  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Anybody remember that show, Uh, Hey Dude?  It was on Nickelodeon.  Yeah, it was...  That was the great block.  It was Hey Dude and Salute Your Shorts.  Ben Stiller's wife was on Hey Dude.  That's right, she was.  Christian Taylor.  And I'll tell you about Hey Dude.  That was the one show where usually, where you got a good show and a content block.  Like you were saying, you have Saved by the Bell.  And then you just put shitty shows on, like California Dreams and City Guys, to try to fill out the rest of it.  But with Hey Dude and Salute Your Shorts, both those shows were independently great shows. 
[03:42:30]  Did you like them both, Eric?  Yeah.  Roland?  Yeah, I always loved those.  Wasn't...  Oh, maybe I'm wrong on this.  Wasn't Budnick on Salute Your Shorts, wasn't he Sam on Different Strokes?  You bet he was.  Bobby Budnick, and that's crazy.  And that shows you the range of that actor, Bobby Budnick.  I don't know his name.  But he had great range, because Sam, on Different Strokes, he was this goody-two-shoes who wouldn't...  I remember one time he referred to snacks as in-between-meal snacks and was explaining that he wasn't allowed to eat them. 
[03:43:00]  You don't get much more goody-two-shoes than that.  But Bobby Budnick, whoo, he might as well have not had parents.  This kid was so wild.  Rebel.  You ever see any of those shows, Alan Tick Jr., or are you a little young?  Salute Your Shorts, I've seen.  I haven't seen any of those other ones.  How old are you?  21 this last month.  Tough question, though, huh?  I had to stretch back into the back of the old memory to grab that number.  I don't think about how old I am that much, to be perfectly honest.  Right, and then sometimes it escapes you.  Yeah. 
[03:43:30]  Life's hard.  Sometimes it escapes you.  Jeremy in Atlanta?  Oh, wait.  There you go.  Jeremy.  Yeah.  Hey, that caller I called a couple times, a couple calls ago, was talking about the show  at the high school.  Wasn't that called Say What, where the kids came walking out of the lockers, and then they  had, like, scenes where they're in front of a firing squad?  That sounds like you can't do that on television.  That was a great one.  That was from Canada.  Eric and I were wrestling to get to that one first.  No, no, no. 
[03:44:00]  Did you ever see Are You Afraid of the Dark?  Yeah, a meeting in the Midnight Society?  Yeah, that was, like, one of my favorite shows.  I used to be so scared of that one.  Yeah, I mean, SNCC would a lot of times turn off at 9.30 for me, because I'm like, I can't  handle Are You Afraid of the Dark right now.  It was that, and they had a show, Erie, Indiana, right?  Yeah, but that wasn't on SNCC.  Oh.  Erie, Indiana was on, like, Saturday mornings.  Or, like, Saturday.  It would be, no, it would be on, like, Saturday at noon, because it'd be after the cartoons,  when it's, like, some of us pre-teens were awake.  Like, ah, I woke up at 9.30 today. 
[03:44:30]  Ed in New York.  Yeah, I'm talking about the caller who called about the kids who went away to high school.  It was actually called USA High.  They went to France, and there was a British headmaster, and there was this, like, New York  Italian kid named Lazzarini who was always into meat and stuff like that.  I never heard of that show.  I believe you, but I've never heard of it.  I know Nick Frino, substitute teacher.  That's from Band of Brothers.  He looks like Voss.  Nick Frino, substitute teacher, is where, or whatever teacher, is where Mila Kunis got 
[03:45:00]  her start, before 70s show.  Tom in Philly.  Yeah, I think the show he was talking about was Breaker High with Ryan Gosling.  Look, whatever the name of the show is, I am not interested.  It's USA High, and it's awful.  Yeah, you never saw it, right?  No, but it was on for two years.  But when IMDb says it's compared to Saved by the Bell, Running the Halls, California Dreams,  and it's all the same show.  It's one of those shows.  Blake in Rhode Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, dude?  How awesome was Nick Arcade at the time? 
[03:45:30]  Wasn't that fun?  Oh, my gosh.  First of all, the dude, the black dude, Phil, I think his name was, the guy who was the  host, he was one of the judges on Figure It Out.  So I was sitting there going, holy shit, it's the black dude from Nick Arcade.  Second of all, when you're a little kid and you don't understand green screen technology,  getting put inside a video game is the fucking coolest thing you could imagine.  Yeah, the best thing is, right now, you can kind of reenact it with Xbox Kinect.  It's somewhat similar.  The Kinect sucks. 
[03:46:00]  Does it suck?  It's not as bad as Nick Arcade sucked.  I mean, you're just jumping up, bloop, bloop.  Do you remember Nickelodeon Guts?  Do I remember Nickelodeon Guts?  Oh, shit.  Sal, there was a period in my life where the only thing I wanted was this piece of the  aggro crag.  Aggro crag.  Let's go to the leaderboard, move!  I remember, you know how much I remember.  Mo was British, right?  Yeah.  You know how much I remember that show?  Remember, Eric, a few years ago when NBC sent me down for the show to do the pilot week  or whatever, and I was interviewing everybody from all those shows? 
[03:46:30]  Right.  One of those guys, what was the name of the host of Guts?  Michael Malley.  Right.  Michael Malley was in a show, and he was promoting his sitcom or whatever, and the  only thing I would talk about was, let's go to the leaderboard, move!  Just yelling, move!  At him the whole time.  Tom in Farmingdale.  What's up, boys?  How we doing?  Good.  Sammy, boy, I'm a little disgusted with the lack of DuckTales talk that's going on right  now.  Also, hey, what's up with the Sudoku, man? 
[03:47:00]  You got one today?  Let me touch that shit.  No, you ripped it up.  Actually, I might have one in the office.  I'll give you an old one, Tom.  All right, man.  That's awesome.  Thanks.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold.  Time to enter and get us addressed.  Legends of the Hidden Temple?  Yeah, I remember that, but I couldn't get down with it at all.  Loved it.  I thought it was stupid.  I could not get down with it.  I thought Olmec was a piece of shit.  I wasn't interested.  But, yeah, DuckTales was only good until you got old enough to realize that if Scrooge  McDuck really did a dive into his safe, he would have been paralyzed after he had  just slammed down on those coins. 
[03:47:30]  You can't swim through coins, Alan Thicke Jr.  Put that theme song, man.  Life is like a hurricane.  Oh, God.  Where, Eric?  Where is life like a hurricane?  Here in Duckburg.  That's exactly right.  Biff.  Yeah, I wanted to talk about cultural lexicon and cultural fabric.  I think you'd have to talk about the California Raisins.  They were a huge part of the late 80s, early 90s.  It's true, and Alan Thicke Jr., you probably don't remember, because you're only 21 years 
[03:48:00]  old.  I've got to tell you something.  When I was a kid, California Raisins were huge.  Huge.  I had little California Raisins toys.  Did you, Roland?  Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine, he's squeezing the place.  Yeah, a little raisin singing, I heard it through the grapevine, for those of you that  had no idea what Roland just said.  I can't remember that show.  Yeah, you're young, too, though.  I mean, you'd remember it as somebody once talking about it.  Wait, California Raisins had a show?  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sunday, it was like a Saturday morning show on ABC. 
[03:48:30]  I think Spud McKenzie had a cartoon show, too.  I thought that was just the advertising thing that they spun off into.  No, it was one of those things where the advertisements got so huge, it became its own thing, and it  became a show, and it became toys, and it became everything.  I didn't know that.  Did you have a Spud McKenzie doll?  What's Spud McKenzie?  The Budweiser dog.  The pit bull.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about.  Matt in Texas.  I tried to paint my dog's eye black.  Did you really?  Yeah.  How'd it go?  Hang on, hang on, hang on, Matt. 
[03:49:00]  I went and told my mom, the dog's crying.  You tried to paint your dog's eye black so he would look like Spud McKenzie, the Budweiser?  And my mom goes, what happened?  I go, I put black paint by the eye on me, and my mom goes, oh, Jesus.  So we rushed our dog to the veterinarian.  You were a little stupid kid, huh?  Pretty much.  Matt in Texas.  Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, I'd go to a pizza parlor with my parents. 
[03:49:30]  They'd sit there and drink beer, and we'd watch the new Simpsons when it came on.  Yeah, but you can't reminisce about a show that's still on.  Like, I understand the Simpsons has been around forever, but they're still making episodes so that we can't have fun with it.  Eric, you should have your people at the Simpsons cancel that show so we can reminisce and talk about when it was actually good.  Make it nostalgic.  Because instead, the Simpsons is still on, and so all we can talk about is how bad it is every Sunday.  You've still got another two years.  Yeah, dude, you're blowing up Eric's podcast right now.  They're going for $25.  It's not a good show anymore. 
[03:50:00]  The writing's been good.  It has not been good.  No one hasn't.  The last few years has been good.  No one hasn't.  You remember What Would You Do?  Yeah, I do.  Did you say that with Mark Summers?  With Mark Summers, that was after that OCD freak got rid of Double Dare.  Didn't he sing the song?  No, he didn't sing it, but I remember the song.  What?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  What?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I remember.  You know why I loved that show?  Because the first time I ever saw it, Bobby the Brain Heenan made a guest appearance on it.  And at that point, I said, any show Bobby the Brain Heenan's on, I'm on board for it. 
[03:50:30]  So I watched every episode.  Tyler.  Yeah.  But the worst fucking thing is when you would get up on a Sunday morning hoping to get cartoons,  and you'd have to look at stupid Linda Ellerbe.  Yeah, Linda Ellerbe.  Oh, right.  And you're sitting there going, Linda, I don't care how relatable you make this to people of my age.  I'm not fucking interested unless it's animated.  Yeah, I want to watch cartoons.  I don't give a flying fuck that some kid's starving in Africa. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, where are the Muppet Babies?  I'm not here to watch you.  I think they fired her from regular network news because she was too ugly.  She used to be on TV in the 80s, but I think they fired her because she was too ugly.  And you think she was too ugly so all they could do was put her out of the kids?  Kids won't mind.  She's frightening, all of them.  Yeah, but she's not going to touch them, so they're like, oh, put her with the ugly lady.  Do you like Muppet Babies?  I love them.  They were the greatest, weren't they?  I had every stuffed animal.  They're never coming out on DVD.  Why?  Because they can't get the rights to all the clips they used. 
[03:51:30]  Oh.  Because they used to open the closet and it'd be a clip to a movie or they'd flash back to something.  Star Wars.  Well, they figured it out for Wonder Years.  They just changed the theme song to something horrible.  Like the Wonder Years theme song.  Is that Joe Cockerberg?  No, it's terrible.  It's like corny and cheesy.  8-bit Nintendo.  Yeah.  What?  What do you do?  Uh, whoever in Baton Rouge.  Hey, Sam Boone.  What's up, buddy?  Do you remember the show on Saturday Night Snick, Wienerville, and how funny just the name was? 
[03:52:00]  See, that's the thing.  That's what so, I remember the name and thinking that that must be a hilarious show, but I don't remember the show.  It's a fucking, the guy would put his face into puppet scenarios.  Oh, I'm looking at pictures now.  Google image Wienerville, if you don't remember and you're somebody who's around our age.  Because you'll remember it.  The show was terrible, but you had to watch it because it was named Wienerville.  And then you could be like, yeah, I was just watching Wienerville.  Mom, I can say it. 
[03:52:30]  It's the name of the show.  Snowy.  Hey, how you guys doing, man?  Good, buddy.  Well, I'm not old than you guys.  When I was growing up, I was, well, MASH was my show growing up.  But we're talking about Saturday morning, old shows, Lidsville.  You ever hear of that one at all?  Snowy, I got to hang up on you.  That's not a conversation for you.  I'm sorry, Snowy.  You know I love you, but it's not a conversation for you.  Alan Thicke Jr. is over there going like, what is this, history class?  MASH?  Lidsville?  That's for six to ten. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, exactly.  We have four hours of that for you.  So I'm trying to squeeze in as much as I can here.  Greg in Texas.  Well, I know how everything always comes back to wrestling with you, Sam.  By the way, first time caller, long time listener.  Nice.  Hulk Hogan's rockin' wrestling.  Dude, just to see the Junkyard Dog as a cartoon was worth it.  That was totally worth it.  Not to mention the bad guys.  The bad guys was Roddy Roddy Piper and the Iron Sheik.  It was amazing.  Also, the other dude, a couple calls back, stole my thunder about you can't do that on television. 
[03:53:30]  I just had a huge crush on the line of sports that when I was a kid.  Yeah, I used to, I mean, I used to love that show just because, uh, that, that show is where the Nickelodeon slime first came from.  I mean, how can you, and I would just, the show was not a good show.  But you would just watch it waiting for a mess to happen.  You'd just watch it because you know somebody's gonna get slimed and you get to see stuff get messed up.  And they're still slimed.  I used to get so scared, though, of the opening credits, that head.  Oh, where it would crack open like an egg? 
[03:54:00]  I was freaked out by that head.  That head freaked me out.  I didn't like it at all.  At all.  I would turn away from the TV before the opening credits were done.  Would you watch Tales from the Crypt?  No, dude.  That's not a kid's show.  That's not a kid's show.  It wasn't?  No, man.  What type of parents are letting you stay up till midnight on a Saturday?  No, they weren't really paying attention.  Horrible, horrible.  You had terrible parents.  Somebody get Alan Thicke Sr. on the phone so I could tell him he did a terrible job with his kids.  He's too busy making money. 
[03:54:30]  He is.  I saw him on Celebrity Wife Swap.  He's got to keep that wife of his, uh, in jewelry.  Is that the one with Gilbert Gottfried?  He was so funny, dude.  Gilbert Gottfried on that show, he kept doing this terrible Alan Thicke impression to Alan Thicke's wife.  Like, every time Alan Thicke's wife said, oh, Alan always says this, Gilbert would go,  yeah, but that's what she said, like, this.  It was really funny.  Uh, Joe in New Mexico.  Hey, guys.  Uh, I was a total bitch for, uh, The Last Unicorn. 
[03:55:00]  Do you remember that one?  I don't remember The Last Unicorn, but I'm assuming it's along the same lines of the show  where I would sit there and I would watch Nickelodeon shows until this one show came on.  Can I guess?  Wait.  Okay.  I'm going to sing a little bit of the song and then you can guess.  Was it a daytime show?  Yep.  Okay.  And I'm sitting there and I'm watching all the cartoons and when this daytime show hit,  this cartoon, I knew that I was done watching Nickelodeon for the day because I hated it.  I hated it. 
[03:55:30]  And other people loved it.  I hated this show.  Every minute that the song started going, look around you.  You remember that song, Eric?  Sing a little more.  David the gnome.  David the fucking gnome.  I hated that guy.  I was, that was my answer before you saying it, but I didn't know the theme song.  There are many things to see.  It's the father from Happy Days.  It was it?  Yeah.  I hated that show.  Tom Bosley.  People come to me now and they're reminiscing.  They're like, remember David the gnome?  I'm like, yes.  And I wish you hadn't reminded me of it. 
[03:56:00]  You know David the gnome, Alan Thicke Jr.?  Never heard of it.  A little before your time.  It was on around lunchtime.  Yeah, exactly.  And then when, that's when you knew it was lunchtime and time to turn off this goddamn  boob tube.  And might have a bee.  I hated that guy.  Did you watch David the gnome rolling?  No, I loved The Mask.  The Mask?  The movie?  No, the animation series.  You mean Mask?  Like Fighting Crusaders?  It was like G.I. Joe's.  Yeah, but they had masks.  Yeah, they had masks.  They were working overtime fighting crime.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Matt Tracker was the lead character on that show. 
[03:56:30]  Because Tracker's gonna save the mission.  And Spectrum's got some supervision.  Did Todd sing that?  He could have.  Somebody stole his gig.  And they go, m-m-m-m-mask.  Mask!  The toys were fun.  Yeah, they were great.  Steve in Boston.  Hey, Mr. Wizard.  Mr. Wizard was fucking awesome.  I would watch Mr. Wizard, and I would always be like, you know what?  I would watch it for about five minutes, and then I would start to feel like I was learning 
[03:57:00]  something.  And I'd be like, no, no, no.  You are not gonna trick me into doing this.  Change the channel.  I'm not gonna sit here and learn something.  I don't care how accessible it is to me as a little kid.  John.  Do you ever think he got really mad at the kids that, like, screwed up all the experiments?  Like, they'd have to go cut, and he'd have to redo it again?  I mean, look.  I don't know the guy.  I'm assuming...  He looks like he could be mad.  I'm assuming he slapped one of those kids.  Right across the face.  Probably more than that.  Look at him.  What the fuck do you think you're doing, Ben? 
[03:57:30]  He's anti-Mr. Rogers.  Those Bunsen burners don't grow on trees!  You fucked up my kitchen.  His kitchen.  Oh, my God.  I have to pull that way.  I heard you're getting upset because somebody fucked up his kitchen.  Well, they were all in his kitchen.  I know.  They were all those little kids hanging out in Mr. Wizard's kitchen.  I don't know what that was about.  Sure.  John in North Carolina.  Hey, Sam.  Love the show, bud.  Thanks.  Hey, man.  Really digging back, man.  It's making me kind of go back to childhood.  And I was always a big reading rainbow, like, first and second grade. 
[03:58:00]  But that's what I'm talking about.  You knew.  I don't care.  LeVar Burton or no LeVar Burton.  You were learning from that show.  And that's why I would turn it off.  Only when I liked it is when he actually had to go.  He got somewhere with the factory, what shit being made and whatnot.  I liked that episode where they kept making him.  Like, he was like, I want to read you this book.  And they were yelling at him, your name is Toby!  Another show, man.  Are you afraid of the dark?  Of course, yeah.  We were just talking about that a minute ago.  Meeting in the Midnight Society.  I had to step out of the car. 
[03:58:30]  And I was hoping I wouldn't miss that segment.  But I was like that.  The clown episode freaked me the fuck out.  There's a few in there that freaked me the fuck out.  And when the mall turns into a human pinball game, I didn't like that either.  That's fucking funny.  And you know why?  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  I was always afraid of malls, too.  Because Punky Brewster.  Did you guys watch Punky Brewster?  Punky Brewster.  You know the story?  You know how that show started?  You know why she was living with that old pedophile?  Because her mom dropped her off at the mall and then drove away and never came back. 
[03:59:00]  And I was sitting there watching that show like, what the fuck?  Parents can do that?  And I was looking.  And from that moment on, when I understood the pitch, the pilot of that show, I would look at my mom and be like, at any moment, you could just drive away.  And I'd be totally lost.  I would have to live with a pedophile and his dog.  Or you could move over to Blossom.  That's true.  Do you remember on Punky Brewster, her friend, Cherry?  Yeah.  Right?  They were playing Hiding Seek and she hid in a fridge and she passed out. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, I remember that.  And then they had to do the whole public safety thing about taking the doors off the appliances before you throw them out.  The weird thing about Punky Brewster was Henry, the grandpa, the guy she lived with, he always had like, like, the cleanest face.  Like, he never had any stubble.  And I always wondered, how do you do it?  Like, you know, he's sitting in this apartment.  He doesn't seem to, I don't know what his job is.  He doesn't seem to be making any money.  He runs the police academy.  Is that what he did?  Well, in the movies he did.  He was the guy from police academy. 
[04:00:00]  But still, it doesn't seem like that would be enough money to afford to buy new razors every month.  Alan Thicke Jr., you started shaving recently.  Right.  Have you noticed the price you pay for new razor blades?  All my extra money.  How much?  How much?  Like 30 bucks.  Is that in pesos?  Sos!  You're doing this every month for the rest of your life.
