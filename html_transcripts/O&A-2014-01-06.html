<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts returning from a hiatus, immediately complaining about poor microphone quality and a lack of pre-prepared material.  They joked about E-Rock's tardiness and significant weight loss, speculating on the reasons behind it.  The upcoming SiriusXM channel restructuring was discussed, noting Ron and Fez's move to another channel but confirming continued collaboration.  A significant portion was dedicated to debunking a hoax news report about a missing girl, which one host had initially believed, highlighting the ease with which misinformation spreads online.  A caller, Dave from New Hampshire, pointed out incorrect scheduling information on the show's website, which the hosts rectified.  Personal anecdotes followed, with Sam recounting a cheese-cutting injury and a champagne cork eye injury, while Opie shared New Year's Eve hosting experiences and encounters with other celebrities.  A new intern's coffee spill was also mentioned.

The discussion then turned to comedian Natasha's controversial joke about SpaghettiOs on Pearl Harbor Day, and the hosts praised her response to the backlash.  This segued into a highly critical discussion of Melissa Harris-Perry's apology for a joke about a Romney family photo.  The segment concluded with commentary on other media personalities, including a sportscaster with a lisp and Jay Leno's departure from *The Tonight Show*, and a humorous dating profile read by Opie.


The next segment started with a conversation about a woman's diverse metal music taste, touching on the perceived white pride in Viking metal.  Listener complaints about Sam's pre-show segment led to Opie blocking him.  The hosts then joked about a significant temperature drop and potential apocalyptic scenarios.  Opie detailed a frustrating gambling experience at the Borgata, recounting a confrontation with a slow dealer and a drunk patron.  The hosts compared their recent vacations and movie viewings, including *12 Years a Slave*, *Dallas Buyers Club*, and *American Hustle*, and discussed a new, luxurious movie theater.  Opie shared an anecdote about a failed attempt at intimacy in a movie theater during *Friday the 13th*. A clip from *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee* featuring Louis C.K. was played.  The segment concluded with a discussion of graphic anti-smoking PSAs, the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, the challenges of transporting it, and the potential problems with its widespread availability, especially edibles. Online gambling legalization in New Jersey was also briefly mentioned.


A substantial portion of the following segment focused on Mike Tyson's autobiography, detailing his drug addiction, criminal record, numerous sexual partners and children, and financial struggles despite earning nearly a billion dollars.  Specific anecdotes from the book, including conflicts with Don King, were discussed, along with a caller's story about a former cellmate who was Tyson's coke dealer.  The hosts recounted attending a UFC event, mentioning specific fights (Ronda Rousey vs. Miesha Tate, Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman), and witnessing Silva's leg break.  One host recounted a car accident, highlighting his co-host's calm reaction.  A significant portion was dedicated to a Reddit AMA featuring a man claiming to have two penises, with the hosts debating the authenticity of the claims and images, ultimately concluding it was a hoax.


The final segment began with a discussion about a picture possibly depicting genitals and the number of testicles.  The hosts debated its authenticity using vulgar language and humorous speculation.  The conversation shifted to Boston Mayor Menino's impending departure, with the hosts commenting on outlasting him.  Upcoming tour dates for one of the hosts were briefly mentioned, followed by a soundbite from Mayor Menino's farewell speech. The broadcast ended with a post-show announcement.

[00:02:30]  monitor me right yes exactly why you do look thinner doesn't he look a little thinner it bothers me i was  hoping you'd be even worse don't worry it's aids i hope so i mean you know i don't want to root for  you know fucking cancer but it would be great fodder for our show how many pounds you lose i don't  know i haven't actually definitely look like you lost a few thank you um the studio looks good i'm  you know now that it's exactly the same every piece of dust is exactly where we left it yeah with a 
[00:03:00]  little dust on it yes on top of that dust is that phase two of this whole thing yeah yeah that must  be phase two i think they're waiting they're waiting for what for the big uh redo of the studio  they're not gonna do that no little changes they're gonna do a big redo when is that yeah and why not  when we're off and yeah and why couldn't they start with like these tiny little changes that would  yeah yeah would have made us feel like wow i guess this is a list destination right right someone was  listening i guess they were hoping stacy keach would do that ah wow that's that was good for 
[00:03:30]  the listeners the listeners feel like it's something's different but we don't no it's the  same we didn't really get any kind of we're actually gonna do the studio build out right until the  studio completely collapsed to a week before right that's true when it when it broke and we were off  for two days yeah so so now the wait is on for parts but they couldn't even dust the place no right  right it's just the same the second you left you just locked the door and and that was yeah that was 
[00:04:00]  it yeah the air seems a little still left it alone like a fucking like a young child that passed away  and their parents just leave the room right exactly there's still a fucking like a high school football  banner on the wall from 1972 exactly the trophy's still here i say gary's best secretary trophy  is right gary what who he was the the boy guy was a radio wizard how long ago how long ago was that 
[00:04:30]  he i don't remember that was a different regime a different time that was before we were a media  destination yes today media destination day one day one of a media destination so who's coming to this  destination i don't know today or we're an oasis on day one we uh we learned that uh we start at 6 30  now yeah that's right and we have stacy keach is the voice of the channel the whole channel he sounds  fucking awesome does sound great i love the stacy keach voice we'll try to keep it as positive at 
[00:05:00]  times that's good at times i'll tell you right now that shit sounded great and it's not one of those like  a keifer sutherland trick jobs where we just got him to say it much it's just a bunch of things it's  exclusive he actually is yeah he made me feel like my career hasn't been a complete waste of  fucking time good ah that is good that sounded kind of impressive it did holy fuck the listeners  only knew the highlight of my uh my 2014 morning yeah was uh actually not really having a place to 
[00:05:30]  sit uh so i went into the other office and i spent uh what could be such an enlightening  five minutes having to speak to our new intern what which was just what i want to do after coming  back from fucking a couple of weeks vacation nobody thought that maybe we could put the interns in the  other office no because that's the office i was in opi was in the other office but then with  roland and e-rock and everything and there's like you know it's it's not made for uh uh well roland's 
[00:06:00]  no treat and e-rock certainly is no treat e-rock wants to listen to the radio show i'm like ah no  dude's fucking turn off he has the channel crank i'm like why would i want to listen to that  and then jimmy came in so i thought jimmy wanted to come in the other office so i went to the one  where travis was in right that walk-in closet yeah and apparently the new intern he lives in jersey  right across the bridge don't worry about don't worry about it he's right across the bridge wait 
[00:06:30]  we lost the other interns yeah yeah we never even got to know their names it's a media destination  now new media destination i stood and just looked at opi and anthony in a tiny office yeah it was  really sad we realized i think we all realized this morning if we don't have microphones on we just  don't want to talk to each other it's just at least something going on we need some fodder there  was some weird small talk we should just walk around with microphones microphones right hanging  around our necks yes e-rock a couple new interns one is a girl oh yeah she's in there with travis oh 
[00:07:00]  yeah i like nikki and the other ones i remember they were okay the last semester ended they're gone  huh they're gone nikki's coming back for another spot in the company oh look at her what how did that  happen as a job job no no no as an intern for like what for not for liam or liam oh it is a  yeah okay yeah i don't blame her yeah don't blame her yeah you move around a little bit yeah yeah  yeah it feels weird talking before that because like i don't want to say anything i'm going to say on  the air like i was like i want to hear about all this stuff but i want to hear it like fresh yeah yeah 
[00:07:30]  that's why i'm like a i'm like i say nothing before the show okay so yes sir yes sir so that means uh  sam that pre-show nonsense you were doing do it from somewhere else okay i'm not sitting i'm not sitting down the  hall in those dumb offices find a walkie-talkie on a home yeah yeah go so i actually actually set up  right outside the studio a little desk we'll get you a card table yeah all right maybe i'll do it from  that inside room so i can watch you guys in the big studio and we can interrupt if we can yeah that's 
[00:08:00]  not a bad idea yeah because this is our home right here and as lame as it is we can at least feel  comfortable in here yeah yeah and look at our tvs i'll be able to see what they're talking about and look up  and see you know the imus or we should just start when we usually we're starting that would be fine  too if we're all here we might as well turn the microphone on the goddamn mics on purpose was to  get a little uh more west coast action and also to get a little more sleep yeah just a little bit  that didn't work this morning i was up up as a pup yeah i couldn't get to sleep last night really 
[00:08:30]  yeah yeah i'm just thinking like oh okay gotta get back in and then i got up early well you know the  regular time when we would have had to go on at six and i go outside and there it is flat tire on  the old escalade wow really yeah frozen uh i guess because it was cold out so then i went to get in  the mustang i was going to take the mustang in and uh it hasn't been running a while because the  weather you know i don't take it out in the cold and that was dead so i drove on the flat tire gas 
[00:09:00]  station i know this is thrilling but uh that's what happened that sucks in the morning so i wound up i  know but the good thing is you know i wound up getting here like six so that would have been  bad if we were starting at the normal time wow you don't walk until 6 15. you would have walked in  exactly it would have been fine i know perfect exactly that's earlier than you normally get  here oh jesus i'm kidding man oh my god i woke up i went to bed 10 30 last night i was tired i was 
[00:09:30]  wow i went to bed i got my new apnea mask didn't work it's a full face hockey mask that thing is  creepy was that the one you're oh no that's the that's oh no one number one oh i want to see a new  one i thought i saw the new one i tweeted that one this one i haven't tweeted this one's a full face  hockey mask no that's the old one right yeah the one where it makes you look like bane yeah yeah that  that's an old one oh yeah wow jesus how the of course you can't sleep yeah who could sleep like that  sleep like that i can't sleep if the edge of the pillow is a little over my nose or something 
[00:10:00]  never mind that yeah apparatus how the fuck does that help and you hear air all night  fucking being forced into your body not in that one but in the new one i tried to do a  fucking respirator i'll take a picture of the one in the hockey mask it's like oh yeah you hear that all  like no way i got five minutes i took it off so you're you're back to square one oh i've never  gotten off square one i went to bed at 10 30 woke up at 3 30 and you should get some propofol man 
[00:10:30]  oh man right that's my jackson yo it's tempting it's tempting no jimmy no i don't do the drugs  i know stay off the drugs people have a lot of questions out there yes they do i try to like just  tweet a couple little things and then you realize why tweet at all because people just hear what they  want to hear yeah yeah they it's mind-boggling my tweets couldn't been more simple about what's going 
[00:11:00]  on yeah and then they just don't read it properly or they just want to want it to be some other way  so then they throw it back at you i'm like i didn't i didn't say that i didn't say it that isn't  it basically i mean i think our show has never sounded better but the channel itself has been a  mess for years there's no rhyme or reason to it so tim sabian wants to just break the whole  thing down and pretty much just rebuild it yeah and that's what we're gonna do so the whole east side 
[00:11:30]  dave thing of course we don't want east side dave off the channel no you idiots love east side dave  and and i'm sure we'll figure out exactly you know what he's gonna do for the channel i want him  on he's very funny but there's been no rhyme or reason to the weekend programming our replays the um  i mean and i'm not taking anything away from these guys it was more the the people that were  overseeing the channel it has nothing to do with our guys they they did their jobs properly yeah but 
[00:12:00]  then like just playing like uh what we call filler there was no rhyme or reason to that a lot of  people would complain they're hearing the same filler over and over again the production had no  real theme to it so you know willy-nilly yeah you know and whether it works or not that's that's  that's the philosophy break the whole thing down and pretty much start over and and rebuild the  thing right and that's what we're gonna do and then the twitter people are like oh so that means and 
[00:12:30]  then they'd come up with their own no that's not what it means no it means exactly what it means  you know the one tim tim knows how to build things he's a radio guy he's the first radio guy we've had  since eric logan building gallows for himself so we're talking like four years where this channel  had no fucking direction we we had a very good radio show don't don't don't confuse that but the  rest of it was just nonsense didn't like the radio wizard and his impulse oh christ you know but i 
[00:13:00]  mean a lot of the listeners even said you know stop complaining do something about it so that's  what's happening now and hopefully it'll work and hopefully it'll be a better listening experience  for everyone we have to welcome the west coast yeah the west coast we get to talk to now yes and  the whole ron and fez thing of course we didn't want ron and fez leaving the channel but the philosophy  there was they want us to be heard more on the on the left coast then people like well it doesn't  matter because i got an on demand app i mean i'm i'm happy for the people that listen to this show 
[00:13:30]  on demand that's huge and it's going to be a huge business down the road but the fact still remains  it's way more important for in-car listening right there's such there's way more people listening to  this radio show in their cars than on demand that is a fact and that's that's the philosophy with the  company they want us heard more uh on the left coast last period ma'am and they also realize that  ron and fez uh our ron is uh talented enough i'm not playing that anymore oh that that he can go over 
[00:14:00]  and help raw dog because raw dog is you know it's is a channel that needs uh some help so it's a win-win  for everybody it's a it's a great opportunity for ron and fez to be over there at raw dog and of course  we're still going to interact with them of course ron will still be on our uh channel and and then of  course we'll go over there from time to time but if you do that show you're no longer allowed to  show that's exactly it so nothing i mean nothing is set we're trying out uh starting at 6 30 that 
[00:14:30]  might not even work we might go back to six we might do seven we might i don't know i i i don't  fucking know i tried to communicate with some twitter people about that but i was so busy  laughing at that uh guy that news guy that said hey i'd like to that uh girl that missing girl i'd  fuck her i'd what no of course he didn't it was fake and it was so it was so fake it was so fake and 
[00:15:00]  every person that sent that to me i'm like how can i fucking come to your house and rob you exactly  like i was like you're a dope and then people pointed out that sam had posted it as real on  facebook oh it doesn't matter with you sam did you get did you get tricked by this one i it was  one of those things it's gonna be hard for you to admit that you might really is gonna be i can't  even answer the question without being attacked i'm not the enemy i know this is gonna be hard for  you oh this is gonna be very it's gonna be very hard that you might have to admit that you've been 
[00:15:30]  fooled it was one of those things where you see it and so you get so excited that it the potential of it  being real see that's what it reminds everything that's what people do they get so excited that it  could be real that they just don't acknowledge the fact that it can't be real well let's start  with the fact that the guy it's horrible acting terrible and he puts in ipod headphones he's got  ipod headphones in instead of one of his little news uh earpieces there's no affiliate on the fox  thing really i posted it and then i was like jess come here you got to look at this and then the 
[00:16:00]  second time i watched it when i showed it to jess did you go uh-oh just start turning red and get  a little hot just point out that it was fake no i'm walking away while it was playing no but you  could i mean all the cues were there and everything yeah she had to pretend no she poor jess she plans  to fake a lot of things in that marriage oh poor young lady damn just attacks yeah you want to play  it for everybody yeah this is the one that should not be sent out unless you want to look like a 
[00:16:30]  dolt yeah be the one be the one that you know rises above this right and say hey idiots this is fake  you look like a superstar all right oh what's the setup basically i guess the setup is the guy's about  to do a live shot yeah for some kind of tv uh channel yep and uh he doesn't realize that you know  they already went to him is it that uh well no go ahead because she says after that when when they 
[00:17:00]  go back to the anchor she's shocked she goes oh we want to apologize for that uh something about the  recorded piece so the the two halves don't even make sense like was it supposed to be a live shot  right or a mis-edited uh recorded piece but you know what angers me the idea is great yeah yeah and then  then they got lazy execution because when they go back to the uh you know the studio the the hostage  guys behind them that no one's talking about talking about that it's grainier the video quality  is different and why would they already have that up exactly it was just done poorly has the guy come 
[00:17:30]  forward yet i don't think so but then somebody also pointed out that if you just click on the guy's  youtube account he's in all his own youtube videos oh you got every single piece including sam roberts  of course sam roberts oh that's great yeah oh i don't care if she's 20. hell i'd fuck her you can't  say you wouldn't fuck her maybe that's what i'll do when they find her i'll go and fuck her oh

[00:27:00]  catchy yeah because they're a bunch of other people's and they're all shitty anyway he's good  man he's the best rapper business he's right up there man he's not anywhere near up there uh let's uh  so natasha's on carson daily show and this is what happened yes all right all right let's move on  spaghetti o's on pearl harbor day they sent out a tweet featuring their mascot holding an american  flag asking people to quote take a moment to remember hashtag pearl harbor with us it offended 
[00:27:30]  a lot of people corporations climbing onto sentimental american historic traditions seemingly looking for  people in business and it wasn't it wasn't good but you were offended for another reason i'm offended  because they're referring to spaghetti o's as pasta i mean it sucks that the only survivors of pearl harbor  are being mocked by the only food they can still chew carson knew anthony edwards enjoy  anthony anderson yeah wow enjoyed it yeah carson knew he dropped his mic like fuck i'm gonna have 
[00:28:00]  to deal with this shit now right and then the other guy's just laughing his balls off yeah what was  her apology or her lack there was a lack of an apology yeah good for her great good for her it was great  yeah what did she say again she did both things she she said it straight where it's like hey it's  a joke and she showed uh respect for uh you know the veterans of course nothing by that it's a dopey  joke stop it everyone's so sensitive you go to her website she tweeted it there's a link to it 
[00:28:30]  i also tweeted it maybe oh it is in the palace stories next i was too busy tweeting this great video  this guy saying who's gonna fuck this guy oh my god i'll send it to you i'll send it to you it's  hilarious huh here's it yeah read it oh wow i guess this is the uh extension of the little pre-show  read it read it it's too far away yeah 
[00:29:00]  if i have a little monitor here i'd read it it says it's been a busy few days but rest to short yeah  you got it no god i have seen all your messages and i've been busy sifting through different  different creatively misspelled death threats rape fantasies and most of all most of all repeated  use of the c-word right good in the past few days  will you read already i have been called a cunt so much isolate that 
[00:29:30]  i felt like i was in a british pub rooting for the wrong soccer team he almost said the w sound  and yes yes the wong i said i said it correctly no you didn't you fucking started the w you said  anthony edwards exactly but then i corrected myself oh boy i wish i could apologize you can but do you  really want another insincere apology that you know is just an attempt at damage control and not 
[00:30:00]  a real admission of guilt that's great right there that is great hopefully that says a lot right there  the pendulum swinging back the other way yes no  let me try uh instead to be honest i'm not sorry i don't think the amazing courage of american veterans  and specifically those who survived pearl harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke  about dentures on television there you go do you really believe that the people who fought and 
[00:30:30]  defended our freedom against nazis and the axis powers will find a joke about spaghettios too much to  bear hey now i'm offended yes sorry i have more respect for veterans than to think their honor can be in  i don't know i don't know i gotta do it impugged impugged i wish i could push a button and his head  would blow off like in scanners impugged fucking dumbbell what is it impugned 
[00:31:00]  there's a g in there huh ah impugned by a glamorous charming comedian in a fur hat jimmy norton  that's not to say i don't think comedians are a problem in this country they are a financial  drain on the people who date them and talk far too much about themselves it's very funny right there  i'm thrilled to see how passionate death threats against a five foot tall woman are usually the 
[00:31:30]  height of passion hold on let me is she being um sarcastic or facetious sam read that is one run  on sentence i'm thrilled to see how passionate and then she writes death threats against a five foot  tall women are always the height of passionate people are about our country and our veterans  read that as an aside you read it as a long sentence yes yes yes i am too my own father lost his hearing  in the vietnam war what so the issue is pretty close to me too so rather than apologize let me offer another 
[00:32:00]  perspective on the one hand you have me making a joke about how old people can't chew tough foods  very well on the other hand you have veterans who receive inadequate care upon their return from active  duty rampant sexual assault against female soldiers where's that happening staggering rates of suicide  traumatic brain injury ptsd substance abuse and depression amongst soldiers 
[00:32:30]  and political gridlock that prevents these problems from getting solved quickly  why not where do you think your outrage and action would be better served  calling me a cunt or doing something about the above uh calling her a cunt  oh i thought it was a real like test well she has a list of goodbyes and sign-offs she gives to people  yes oh okay uh for those of you that are currently doing both kudos  no to our vets i love you i truly hope that you know that to spaghettios let's do lunch to the 
[00:33:00]  elderly chew and to at neil r scott it's spelled human excrement not human increatment  that's funny and then she gives a link to a donation for disabled veterans foundation  very funny something positive great job right there sincere and funny that's how you do it yeah 
[00:33:30]  it's great yeah because as we've said the apologies are all bullshits oh yeah well msnbc had to apologize  too oh yeah um what's her name your favorite there melissa harris perry harris perry i hate her because  she has the worst fucking oh she does she yeah she has oh no does she have a chip oh it's this  it's the worst it's the worst is it distracting it's like this it's like this it's like a black 
[00:34:00]  baby in there or something yeah yeah what that mother are you know what wait i can't say that  you'll hear a lot of this first call what is she a stone what are you talking about  well out of nowhere uh mitt romney had a family photo and uh wow there was a black baby in the  photograph who knows grand uh child there of course that's gonna get people talking yeah there's nothing  wrong in in my humble opinion having a black grandkid if you're a very white family i don't give a 
[00:34:30]  fuck my myself but yeah but you gotta realize people are gonna notice and say something about it sure  she's a pussy for fucking uh apologize well it was the way it was the hypocritical way they can  talk about things and they just lambast anybody else that does right uh of course you got one black  baby in the midst of all these white faces and they decided that it was pretty funny right um to point  that out and do the old one of these things it's not like the other no problem with that it's fine who 
[00:35:00]  gives a shit i don't give a fuck what channel does it i have no problem with that whether it's  fox cnn or msnbc if someone on fox news had done that msnbc reverend al and and i'm not saying might  do something they absolutely would have jumped on this with a lot more gusto than anyone jumped on her  uh to get an apology what what exactly did they do do we have the clip of that because i heard about  it and read about it but they demanded a firing yeah of course i call her a pussy on twitter  ah pulsa msnbc has set themselves up to kind of have to be perfectly alone because hey oh boy 
[00:35:30]  you'll hear it it's so uncomfortable this is what she did this is okay all right she's cute  here we go no she's not no no i love her get your eyes checked i want to make love to her mouth  you ain't desperate yeah pretty cute everybody loved a baby picture and this was one that really  a lot of people had emotions about this baby picture this year this is the romney family right um 
[00:36:00]  and if and of course they're on um um governor romney's knee is his adopted grandson who is an  african-american adopted african-american child kieran romney any captions for this one one of these things  is not oh boy does he do the same and that little baby front and center would be the one and isn't  he the most gorgeous my my goal is that in 2040 the biggest thing of the year will be the wedding 
[00:36:30]  between karen romney and northwest can you imagine miss romney and kanye west it's fine the black blood on  the panel it's it really sums up the diversity of the republican party yeah you know what i was a comedian  the one we still have so much to get to including the annual look back in laughter tradition of  asking hey was that racist so don't go anywhere there is of course more nerd land at the top of 
[00:37:00]  the hour i was like it no it wasn't even that bad they should have fucking stayed strong it wasn't but  i love the fact that they are the fucking police as far as uh any racial comments go and uh that would  have even just saying one of these things is not like the other that would be like assuming it's  a thing oh that's what reverend al's tack would have been right oh they're talking about a child  as a thing man shut up what was her apology i think she started weeping right yeah she broke 
[00:37:30]  down got a little weak humiliating you didn't see it she broke down no i only saw the twitter apology  god what what yeah oh this is gonna be uncomfortable i haven't seen this yet  i left fayton ohio with two bad knees  we have a lot of news and politics to discuss this morning but before we get to that i am going to  start with an apology last sunday we invited a panel of comedians for a year in review program it's what  we call our look back and laughter but in one of the segments we looked at a number of photos that caught 
[00:38:00]  our attention over the course of the year and in that segment i asked my guests to provide kind of  off-the-cuff ideas for captions of the photos that we were seeing among the images we had was one of  the romney family that showed governor mitt romney's grandchildren including his adopted grandson who is  african-american now given my own family history i'd identified with that picture and i intended to  say positive and celebratory things about it but whatever the intent was the reality is that the segment  proceeded in a way that was offensive whoops showing the photo in that context of that segment 
[00:38:30]  was poor judgment so without reservation or qualification i apologize to the romney family  adults who enter into public life implicitly consent to having less privacy but their families and  especially their children should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly wrong intention was not  malicious but i broke the ground rule the families are off limits and with that i am sorry here she goes  also allow me to apologize to other families that formed through transracial adoption 
[00:39:00]  because i am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families  that's terrific that's terrific  we are dedicated to advocating for a wild diversity  oh you're gonna have to go back  nothing better than some idiot crying on tv  why are you crying  she's crying because she's like oh don't fire me 
[00:39:30]  don't fire me fire me i don't want my employment let's marry him are you kidding me i didn't see this  she's broke down and started crying yeah because you know blubbering idiot the part where she talks  about uh the you know transracial gender thing i don't have no idea what it's called like a white  and a black parent there yeah she got white mommy white mommy yep by the way why are families so off  limits when these guys cart their families out to show how great they are but like they can't get 
[00:40:00]  their families out there fast enough they're not yeah especially politicians they're they're not off  limits why should they be they're on every stage with the with the politics oh yeah big afro remember  him did you go back yes oh my god she's blubbering blubbering blubbering great  because i am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families are in any way funny  or deserving of ridicule oh boy on this program we are dedicated to advocating for a wide diversity 
[00:40:30]  of families it is one of our core principles and i am reminded that when we are doing so it must  always be with the utmost respect i'm genuinely appreciative of everyone who offered serious  you whole generally sunday's program and i am reminded that our fear critics can sometimes be  our best teachers oh god and then they go to black dramatically our fiercest critics sometimes be our 
[00:41:00]  greatest teachers that's a good one wants to talk about the tweet you're talking about with the  sexual abuse and stuff he's a marine oh okay what do we what was probably the the aside where i just  said where's that happening it's just a side joke jeremiah i think yes all right what's up buddy what  what do you want to discuss and we're confused by that to begin with oh well she put on that treat  about how let's talk about sexual assault and let's talk about ptsd and vets and all this stuff 
[00:41:30]  first off the number of actual combat vets that we have from the iraq war is a fraction of what it  really is most guys that are getting out now are claiming ptsd for everything from guys like me  yelling at them to i had a motorcycle accident when i was drunk and then the sexual assault cases we've  had an increase in sexual assault and it's completely minute like it's yes it's a terrible thing 
[00:42:00]  fucking your mute newt fucking call me are you too good  so you're refuting uh what the comedian said about the spaghettio thing  i'm i'm just saying she's she's bringing up kind of like fucking points she has no idea what  she's talking about or whatever and who gives this call actually made me happy to see kenny  yeah exactly sorry all right oh well thank you bless you all right well i'm talking i'm sorry my 
[00:42:30]  call suck that's right thank you no i thought it was terrific thank you sir thank you thank you thank  you wow when did she do that this past sunday uh she had to wait a week yeah i think it was  i don't think it was sunday because she's i it was sometime during the week she just felt sorry  that she she said that 
[00:43:00]  oh christ that's awful i might have i might have tweeted the uh suffering sucker  i said i tweeted something like hey it's all right to you know point out to the you know yeah the  color of a point out young child point out things you know sure and then i tweeted this  suffering second test oh boy you apologize and then there's a guy that does uh the nfl 
[00:43:30]  fucking football games with the worst lisp oh really everyone knows his name and i i have seen him  uh do football games from time to time but his lisp is yeah way worse than hers i was waiting and i  thought he might have fucked up too he uh did colts game oh okay he did the colts game saturday i i  uh i did pretty well with my picks this weekend by the way oh yep you picked philadelphia over dallas  that was a smart pick no i'm i the wild card game saturday and sunday san fran i went uh i i went i 
[00:44:00]  got one right out of four guess which one i got right jesus the colts gave colts one of the most  unbelievable comebacks in in nfl history the second best comeback ever uh behind uh frank reich i  believe oh and uh yeah i i was shitty once again with the rest of them i was just shitty do you have  a clip of this guy um what's his name man look down there i don't know it probably can't be um yeah 
[00:44:30]  mike uh maycock maycock yeah mike maycock man just likes it yeah what a maycock yeah that guy has a  unbelievable i think we talked about this last year as well yeah we talked about him from time  to time this guy's lisp is unbelievably bad it makes watching football really uncomfortable it just doesn't  go together all right guys there's six picks left in the first round and i know you know we keep

[00:46:00]  fucking broadcaster look i might snap her from time to time so i'm out of this discussion  that's a that's a childlike thing and then lou holtz of course is the worst of all time  is there more to that clip there is it bad pointing out people's stops in the rookie  trumaine mcbride working really good coverage there that ball can't be thrown there it's  either got to be thrown five yards deeper or out of bounds wow a mistake by tebow giants make it 
[00:46:30]  pay for it mcbride with the pick in a one-point game really is amazing how do you talk for a  living in this he worked his way up through the business yeah who did he beat out for that job  the elephant man  yeah it's rough to listen to and then of course  oh yeah yeah can you find a good one two years ago joe put  michigan's beating them eight straight times i don't even know what that is penn state team

[00:49:30]  oh i wouldn't have guessed that  i remember i remember this what is this the smiths i hit the post by the way  when i was growing up in the 80s the weirdos listened to the smiths exactly i liked a couple 
[00:50:00]  songs i'm gonna lie to you i dipped my toes in weirdness but i wasn't all in yeah and this morrissey  guy is a fucking weirdo what a period dick morrissey i see no difference between eating animals and  pedophilia oh he's saying everyone should eat animals he loves it give me a burger  and uh you know to the vegetarians out there rogan was tweeting some good 
[00:50:30]  shit over the weekend saying that you know scientists scientists are starting to prove  that that plants do have feelings that are thinking oh what are you gonna eat now  of course they do you think they're a life form i mean our perspective you can't  understand it but as far as the universe goes you gotta think that plants and all everything that  is growing on this on this earth has something going on there's something going on they are a  life form they are a living thing they go through a life cycle that yeah so you know but if they're 
[00:51:00]  not texting then we're like oh the plants right this holier-than-thou attitude of uh we only eat  plants well because it's always on the human perspective that's what that's what  fucks up everything and that's why yeah it will be our demise eventually things without a face they  say yeah the universe thinks very differently than than humans uh morrissey i see no difference  between eating animals and pedophilia he once said meat was murder now controversial singer morrissey 
[00:51:30]  has claimed there is no difference between eating meat and pedophilia i am the former smith's front man  and head weirdo and vegetarian made the claim while talking to fans online uh  uh i see no difference between it between eating animals and pedophilia morrissey answering a question  about why he stopped eating meat they are both rape violence murder rape they are both rape violence  murder if i'm introduced to anyone who eats meat i guess yeah who eats beings oh i see if 
[00:52:00]  i if i'm introduced to anyone who eats beings i walk away how does he know most of his just chomping  away the majority of his fan base eats meat what is he talking about of course dumb vegetarians imagine  for example if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you hello i enjoy bloodshed throat slitting  and the destruction of life well i doubt if you'd wanted to exchange phone numbers i think that's a 
[00:52:30]  little different than yeah he's an ass he's a total fucking ass so he's saying if he was invited to the  white house he would not meet president obama because president obama's not a vegan he eats beans  yeah he's lying the guy's lying what he's saying is if it's somebody i don't really want to talk to or  care about right who i think is lower on the social status chain there you go he's lying yes  yeah that's a dumb analogy no you don't equate meat eating with pedophilia veal maybe yes 
[00:53:00]  yeah good for him dick i never liked those weirdo bands back then anyway no no it was always  ah the cure yeah that's another one where i like the cure a bit but went around with wacky  clothes on and the smiths and morrison they were always you just don't understand man yeah  and he talks to me in my pain nothing worse than trying to hook up with one of those girls at a 
[00:53:30]  party and just bullshitting your way through any dumb conversation she's trying to have with you  they walk around the party with a razor blade in their head the entire time it could happen  could go down at any moment oh you like this smiths yeah right yeah right oh you like that song  yeah yeah i love that song it's fantastic right uh just bullshitting hope you don't get caught  thanks you know they're just crying in a corner somewhere yeah yeah what's wrong what happened 
[00:54:00]  what happened what happened we were we're at a party having fun right what are you doing this song  speaks to me uh a bit manic are you yeah jesus those are the weirdo i liked the girls that liked  charlie daniels and drank whiskey in the woods yep those i could talk to i uh i dbr'd so i haven't  seen the whole thing yet but uh jimmy fallon you know celebrating five years already oh yeah and uh 
[00:54:30]  he does a bob seger parody that had me just oh really howling did you're nodding your head  i think i saw that one huh yeah i've never seen that before i've seen a lot of his music  shit that secret thing is so stupid but it made me laugh my balls off i was watching last night and  laughing at it but at the secret part yeah when he was talking about take the records off and then put  them back on the show no i haven't seen it is there any way we can find that really fast yeah 
[00:55:00]  fucking fallon good for you man and when you put his shit together in one one nice tight package you  realize holy fuck this guy's got it going on yeah that's pretty goddamn good i don't watch on a regular  basis i guess what i'm saying and but i i think after what the little i saw last night i gotta i gotta  start watching him uh a lot more what's he um when is when is yeah when does he make the moves up soon  right a little change over february 17th wow that close after the olympics yeah wait leno's done in 
[00:55:30]  february oh yeah he's got to one more month what's gonna happen with you i think i'm doing one or two  this month i hope something and um that's it wow you would think we'd be hearing more about it yeah but  the holiday you will this month the ratings have been pretty good i think and uh you know leno is leno is  so not gonna retire where is he gonna end up you think do you know anything jimmy i honestly  don't jay well with all these channels someone is gonna pick up jay leno i guarantee that you 
[00:56:00]  what do you think who do you think's in the lead i've heard cnn i've heard cnn needs him desperately  i've heard fox i've heard abc you know again maybe the piers morgan rumor is true and maybe they slide  fucking leno into that slot hmm i know some people cnn's trying to go a little more entertainment oh they  are yeah oh yeah yeah they're trying to get a little entertainment angle going they're going to try to  move away from the news a little bit more a little bit more yeah okay leno would be perfect for seeing 
[00:56:30]  that hmm i've heard that you said you're saying no no for the clip they don't have the clip they took  it down i don't know why jay wouldn't say anyway he's really he's one of those guys he just plays it  if you asked him he'd probably go ah you know who knows let's say i mean he's like he just plays it  really close he's very smart he has a big mouth and all of a sudden he just you know that's why he's been  pretty successful yeah he's he's going to continue absolutely he'll continue i don't think he can for  a while though i think there's contractual oh you think he's got no compete or something yeah i'm 
[00:57:00]  guessing just because i know the staff is done but i think that they're going to get paid through the  end of the contract their full contract price how much more does he have on his contract i believe it  was a year a less than a year probably close to a year ah so you had a little bit i work on some of  some of my cars does a little stand up with mavis i'm all in with uh speaking of stand-up uh seinfeld's  fucking uh coffee with cars or cars coffee oh yeah yeah coffee and drive cars show whatever that is 
[00:57:30]  yeah i'm all in that is pretty i saw the lucy k1 and then i was in a fucking i gotta watch them all loop  yeah what a great concept what is it comedians in cars getting coffee and they yeah the one with uh  louis ck and louis gets them on his boat and they're just tooling up the hudson river and it's it's a  it's a great great concept yeah the gervais one was funny too he's got ricky gervais when he was  driving right letterman he's got the chris rock oh yeah he's got jerry can get anyone yeah jerry just 
[00:58:00]  makes a phone call that's it don rickles and i bet you i was saying uh someone over the break  that i bet you he's having way more fun doing this show than probably he had doing seinfeld i bet  you probably especially near the end of seinfeld when you know the show kind of not ran its course  it never really ran its course but to a creative person it probably did in his mind he's just like  after that many years he just wanted to go do something else he already on autopilot you know he 
[00:58:30]  realized it was a fortune being made anyway still is but she's having a blast doing this thing of  course colin quinn did an episode harry david and everybody's on there but i i heard about this show  for a while and i finally finally checked it out he asked me to do it and i have not done it oh good  for you hold out jimmy i'm holding out you should hold out yes yes that would be such a dumb move for you  no i'm not i'd rather not i've taken the advice of my uh agent and yes i'm doing my friend's car  who got one it's called comedians and rickshaws um so we don't have the jimmy fallon clip that's 
[00:59:00]  too bad i'm taking it off the website i should have told you guys ahead of time so maybe we could  have grabbed it yeah oh no hey what do you think about the uh speaking of rickshaw about the uh horse  horse-drawn carriages in new york city of course de blasio the new mayor wants to uh like top on the  list get rid of them we don't want uh well we don't want that in new york city anymore you know  the the real reason right this de blasio already is driving me nuts is he and i said to people uh 
[00:59:30]  over the break too i'm like it's great for our radio show bloomberg was like a little sissy nanny  whatever yeah but this guy is such full of shit and i can't wait for the people to realize that  first of all the horse and carriage thing and that's all about decadence he doesn't give a  fuck about the horses that's a good point he doesn't give a fuck about the horses themselves  because anyone that has done research on those horses they're treated very well i personally don't 
[01:00:00]  like it and i'm glad they knocked down the fleet but uh they really try to take care of the horses  because they know they have peed up their asses yeah those horses are being taken care of but that's  it's a sign of decadence he doesn't want any of that shit in this city the wealthy or they're on uh  because it's expensive as all hell to take one of those uh horse and carriage rides really expensive  it'll it'll it'll cost you well over a hundred bucks for 20 minutes 30 minutes tops i did it once 
[01:00:30]  how much was it i don't remember 50 but it was it might have been close to 100 it's just been a few  years maybe 10 years what did you do with a girl yeah we took a little just to do it i'd never done it  and she wanted to do it but i would never do it again and i tweeted over the the break it was a  subtle thing but i saw it and i and i i'm i'm only with this guy he's a phony they had him shoveling  snow out out from his house yeah and here's a guy that like i got to take care of new yorkers and this 
[01:01:00]  and that we all got to take care of each other and help each other out right he didn't shovel his  fucking neighbor's sidewalk he just is huh and and and you might be like what's the big deal the big  deal is he had the whole press there yeah but i he's not thinking about other people i'm sorry he's  not he this is his way into politics yeah yeah why wouldn't you shove your neighbor's uh sidewalk in  front of the press the line was perfect because then he'd start putting the salt down yeah and and  and uh his neighbor was untouched yeah i guess that you saw that i i saw your tweet about oh he wants 
[01:01:30]  his there's it wants his neighbor to shovel in front of his fucking place and then that other guy  to shove in front of that place doesn't that go against everything he's been saying so far i don't  know i just don't like the guy uh well yeah i don't love him either but i love the fucking  horse-drawn couch and that makes me so happy i hate those guys they fuck up traffic but i think the  reason he's doing it is it's a symbol of you know that's true what what people with money can do in  this city and we don't we don't want to really fucking you know showcase that stuff yeah i went on one 
[01:02:00]  of those ones a little rusty but uh the owner fed him too much beefarino and uh he was farting oh really  awful that's terrible i had it like cut the trip short  beefarino farts  poor rusty first one of the year huh congratulations sir uh it's about the first one of the year 
[01:02:30]  oh is that a sign of thing oh that's hilarious creamer fed up oh he was farting so bad oh that's  very funny go back to where these uh rusty i think i think the guy is you know he's he's he's a little  bit of a bullshit artist oh yeah yeah he's a he's a career politician just a fucking commie he's you  know confessed commie i don't know what did he say about the uh the walking malls too like like  broadway does he not like that for some reason i heard he didn't i don't think he likes those 
[01:03:00]  uh i don't know what his reason for that is well they just put all that work into it so what now  they're going to try to change it back like let's make a decision and just decision just you know  stick with that yeah it would keep people working though to start taking them down but it'd be such  a waste of money no they just had a whole whole thing going on down there i don't think they will  the time square area i think they they they make a lot of money kind of renting that whole section  out to um big companies that want to come in with their tents and they put on something for a weekend 
[01:03:30]  i've actually been a fan of that i think they shut down the roads and stuff yeah yeah it's great  people watching from time to time yeah it makes walking down there a little easier and it's a lot  easier to get get through there yeah you don't have to stay and ask for cars obviously but i kind of like  it and people have adapted i think with the car thing figured it out but de blasio is gonna be  great for this radio show de blasio because we smell bullshit oh yeah oh yeah and uh i think his  wife is going to be involved in a lot of stuff too i started following her on the twitter really 
[01:04:00]  just to see what she's up to i like keeping tabs on what these people are up to  sometimes i just follow people to see what they're  go with the goings-on you just want to stay close to hell yeah oh yeah  you know his daughter is a huge metal head oh yeah yeah how old is she uh she's still  teenager i think okay right yeah but i mean she's very into like metal not just like i'm saying i'm 
[01:04:30]  in didn't she talk about drinking and drugging and shit yeah what kind of metal though what what's  uh everything like she likes black rock coalition everything no black girl that yeah no  everything like old hair metal or uh i like this i like the new wave of british metal i like viking  metal i like like she gets really specific into like the genres viking metal that goes against some  things really yeah yeah that's a little a lot of white pride going on in the viking metal really  they're very happy of their whiteness i didn't know you knew viking metal oh yeah 
[01:05:00]  oh yeah oh well you got to keep ads on a little bit of everything oh yeah  oh sam pre-show stinks ruined my commute into work wow from from op anthony and jim  sam i'll block this guy for you oh shit thank you for getting tim sabian blocked  it'll be a pleasure to block this guy how does one dumb 25 minute show wreck your day it couldn't 
[01:05:30]  have been a 25 minute ride the host yeah he's gone there sam c all right he was trying to ingratiate  himself to you hey what is this oh he blocked me i'm gonna go follow that guy how dare both of you  uh yeah what are you gonna do so de blasio the sidewalk oh the weather holy  fuck oh that's been a big story the past uh week or so yeah yeah we had a little snowstorm 
[01:06:00]  hercules and then oh fuck all that let's not know the cold but yeah move on to the fact that  kenny picked me up it was 51 degrees in his car and by tonight it's gonna be what eight eight degrees  with the wind chill way way yeah way below that right yeah it's like some kind of one day  planet kind of a thing yeah yeah is it gonna knock the buildings down it really is you can't  have a temperature change like that without some shit going down otherworldly shit in the 50s this  morning a lot of fog because the snow was still on the ground and the ground was cold and then 
[01:06:30]  the air was uh upwards of 50 degrees so it's going to be a 50 degree turnaround in one day  holy fuck it's already happening to uh to the folks out there i think uh i don't want to alarm jim  norton but with all the melting snow and rain from today and the high temperatures and it going to  be it's going to be eight degrees later tonight i think a little black guys might make make an  appearance damn it if we can get jimmy the number of the local precincts he'll be around so we can 
[01:07:00]  call the police people are tweeting their black guys stories i swear you guys i swear we have some  hilarious listeners just out of nowhere that yeah that last guy you blocked  i was uh i was riding around the night it snowed here and it was very bad the roads like just in  the city it was very every turn you make it was really slippery all right wow so yeah yeah uh vacation 
[01:07:30]  um people kind of i think they got the wrong idea what happened my my little um well i had a little  uh i had a great fun time at the borgata i decided i'm gonna take a little little trip to borgata treat  yourself treat myself and i'm going back to see jimmy on the uh what is that february 13th and 14th  13th 14th the whole family's going around the corner man oh good your whole family oh yeah like 
[01:08:00]  aunt's uncle just gonna be like a big shindig yeah yeah yeah all going to see jimmy norton and uh  hang out so uh i was having a great time really good time not winning a lot losing but uh yes i was  losing obviously yeah yeah yeah i say obviously because of your tweets well i i don't think you  would have been as angry if you were winning no because i then got mad when i was winning too okay  a different situation but there is this uh dealer and i will say she was a white woman uh kind of fat 
[01:08:30]  in the ass but uh you know she can't just be a woman no because people would probably assume i i  meant uh asian because the asian women that deal are like machines and they are usually the ones  that okay you're getting a little test i'm glad i asked because i don't know this world yeah yeah yeah  what asian dealers are robots asian women asian dealers will deal those cards and just much too  quickly the no no fun at the table the most fun i know the asian card players the little gambling i do 
[01:09:00]  they're horrendous to sit with yeah they're smoking 8 000 cigarettes and there's no fun to be had at  those tables when they sit down the best dealer you can ever get to sit down with is a middle to  older aged white guy because he'll sit there he's got all the good stories the jokes he wants a fun  table and i think i think the old white broads are pretty good too they can be good too the old  white broad i mean the younger white broads are good to look at but they're they usually aren't that 
[01:09:30]  much fun either no no no you want to have some fun at the goddamn table right well this woman was not  fun uh she's dealing the cards and now they got this uh every game's got a side game now you know  so you're playing blackjack and there's the little circle next to it and you could place a bet that if  uh the dealer's up card falls between your two cards you win like money from this little side bet  but she's just gonna be careful to put it in the right place not the placement to the amount 
[01:10:00]  wait a minute so if you get dealt let's say you get delta five king no how about a five and a nine  a five and a nine all right how about two fives uh two five well then then you have to hope the  deal about a five and uh seven five seven and then if the dealer has a six showing you win a lot of  money because then it's triple like three interrupt right but if you have a like a a a a a a three  and a king right and then they deal a a nine for the up card for the deal how much gambling do you 
[01:10:30]  exactly i'm playing blackjack is enough already i don't care about that dumb little side game do you  do the side game no no i play and how much could you uh bet on the side yeah like a hundred bucks or  something like that there's a limit on the side i think there is i don't even play it so i don't  even know you can't throw like a thousand down because i know i don't think so you go for some  of that action i don't think so i think there's a limit on that okay go ahead sorry uh so so i'm 
[01:11:00]  just playing blackjack but then there's all these little side bets and it's okay i don't care if you  want to play that whatever i'd rather not have it at the table but fuck it so this woman's dealing the  cards and now when the dealer is showing an ace she will look in that little mirror and see if she's  got a blackjack and everybody go you know she goes insurance insurance and then she checks her card  and either says you know i have it or i don't have she turns it over it's blackjack or she puts it back 
[01:11:30]  and you know i might make it through this round so i get dealt um uh a 20 and she has an ace showing  i'm like oh god she looks in the mirror she puts the cards back she does her little  fucking um side bet thing where she's paying off people or taking their money from the little  circles and does that and then she flips over her blackjack no you're supposed to flip that  fucker the second you see it so i get up i'm like you slow rolled your blackjack that's three 
[01:12:00]  fucking times you've done it and it was a third time she did the same thing you don't wait and  fucking then flip it over after you take care of your little business at the table with these other  little bets now as frustrated as you were uh-huh it doesn't affect gameplay does it absolutely  doesn't affect the gameplay you're right it's the same thing it's more of a respect thing or something  it's absolutely a respect thing it's a dig it's fucking it angers the players you want to know 
[01:12:30]  instantly especially when you have a let's say a three thousand dollar bet up you want to know  instantly if you're out or in and when she put her cards back i'm sitting there like oh i'm sitting on  a 20 she's showing an ace you know i'm i'm in pretty good position here and then she flips it  and like i said she did it three fucking times so it's a dick move it's a legal it's a legal move but  it's a dick move no even the even the floor guy came over and said it was a dick move but it's legal  she could do that if she wants to she's not going to keep her job long it's it's it's she's going to 
[01:13:00]  piss the players off right what was she doing in between like just paying off the side those little  side bets yeah paying off or taking the money from the side bets uh and and then flip them but you  do that after you flip with the second you look in that mirror if it's a blackjack you flip your  fucking shit over okay period then we all know what the fucking result is and that's it anyone else at  the table mad yeah a couple people and and and then i told the floor guy he looked at the fucking 
[01:13:30]  security footage and said oh yeah he goes i saw her do it three fucking times i said yeah she did three  times so what'd they do just took off the table uh yeah she that's the last i saw her the night  but i'm sure they didn't fire or anything but uh i was did they get rid of her right away or when  she her her little time i don't know because i walked away from the table i was fucking livid at  that point livid and then i just got pissed off like the next day from some guy and his dopey  whore chick sitting at the table and he wouldn't leave me alone he's like poking me at one point 
[01:14:00]  this was like he's drunk a fan no i think he's just like fucking because i was i was on a tear  for hours at that table i won a fuckload of money that i had you know i had markers to pay but uh  paid them all off i was i was i couldn't lose you were deep in the hole and you came back strong oh yeah  wow and uh and this guy like he started getting more drunk and more drunk so he's poking me in the 
[01:14:30]  the middle of like action he's poking my shoulder and keith's right there to know the guy no no and  i kind of threw my arm up and i went hey dude step off what a nightmare yeah yeah yeah so then i i was  just like leaving the alone stop it what was he saying it's just like hey man you got the thing  that's cool i couldn't even tell there's action on the table i'm not listening to this and then 
[01:15:00]  his starts giving me yeah respect what the yeah and and stop cursing what so i was like you know i  looked i looked at the guy said i said shut your up good for you and then and then well he got a little  huffy and uh and she starts yelling and i and and i'm like she ain't even playing fucking cards i was  like floor get her off the table get her the fuck off the table and uh then the guy started trying to 
[01:15:30]  get closer to me and stuff so keith kind of stepped in there and shit and uh and then security shows up  and i just grabbed i didn't know he was just some drunk fucking asshole so i just picked up what i had  on the table let's see i didn't say it picked up the uh tokens i had on the table my chips what's that  and i uh went i i was just walking away and then security came up so what happened i was  good fucking being an see and that's why i got pissed at the borgata at that point i don't want 
[01:16:00]  to be questioned i'm not a common criminal did it ever occur to you that that was the guy their idea  of a cooler because you were winning uh well he had been there for hours oh okay yeah yeah i had a  table that was second to none on that floor everyone was winning it was a great fucking time my brother  was there fucking dennis we play poker with was there we had a pisser nice and uh and then this

[01:17:00]  turns the card over bullshit no it's not well you should know better than to go there during  amateur hour a bullshit why wouldn't oh you were there during amateur how come they weren't doing  it then all the other times well i agree the deal is a cunt but according to the law that's the way  she's supposed to do it you can do it in a way that doesn't piss the player off no it's not ideal if  you want that then then how about then how about you do this you fucking pay off or take your bets  then you check your mirror that that's what you should all right well she checks a mirror and then 
[01:17:30]  pays the bets so fucker she's still being a twat whatever the fuck order she wants to do it in the  the second she looks at that uh bottom card it gets flipped or it stays down if it's not a  fucking uh 21. well listen love you love of course you do well thanks now that we're immediate destination  that's yes good studios looking great oh yeah i had a wrestle with the fucking phone monitor again  wrestling with it every morning holy to put it in the exact position so jimmy's mic stand doesn't

[01:23:30]  on 84th and broadway they redid the whole theater which with with with with those  chairs those lounge oh i know where that place is the alex huh was it the alex down there what's the  alex movie theater it's like a classic movie theater no it's uh is that a seinfeld reference  no it's like a wonderful uh old style movie it's like a lowe it's right by uh that great dessert  place dude you get the luster on this fine counter you pretty much lay all the way back to watch a 
[01:24:00]  movie now they got rid of half the seats yeah i love every other row is now gone and you got these  massive fucking cushy seats what'd you see uh a kid movie i saw that frost it's right frozen  which by the way i tweeted uh josh gett i had to he was beyond great in that movie i know it's an  animation but his character was hilarious he played the little snowman guy what kind of food oh i i but  no you can't get real food though right i i avoid fucking movie theater food movie theater food is 
[01:24:30]  really bad and you gotta go to dinner before you go or you gotta go to the alamo i snuck some  shit in for my uh young son basement but that was not to say that wasn't the same money that was  because i just didn't want to stay on those goddamn lines yeah so he had his little juice box and  potato chips and goldfish and and everything else alamo draft house in yonkers full dinner  menu really seat serving yeah oh nice dude i we got a theater closer than this one 
[01:25:00]  fuck that theater oh because it doesn't have the seats and then they got the fucking you know the  arm bar where you fucking you know you lift that shit up and it gets oh you could get some action  you could get some shit done yeah never thought of that back in the 50s dude i would imagine that  the youngsters are just dry open their asses off diddling just diddling they have to be gotta be you  lift up that arm and it's like it's it's basically a queen-size bed at that point yeah yeah 
[01:25:30]  i remember back when uh friday the 13th uh was in the movie theater the original came out i believe  it was 1980 and i was trying to finger my uh date uh in the back row of the theater and that armrest  wouldn't come down my arm was bending like a condor leg it was like backwards and trying to get around  it's like it's like trying to get fucking uh a candy bar out of one of the machines through the  fucking and what was your mother's 
[01:26:00]  i'm 45 years old you never get so old  but man jesus i think i'm gonna start going to movies again  yeah because it started like we've talked about the movie theater experience just started getting  shitty yeah better at home right yeah and you don't have to even have a lot of money to have  a better experience at this point it's all in the goddamn seats you want good comfortable 
[01:26:30]  fucking seats you got to have the the tiered levels where you're not looking at the back of  someone's fucking head right that's key to a movie could you go to uh the cars uh driving cars having  coffee thing from seinfeld because this will make sense louis ck yeah was talking about his favorite  thing to do in the world and it's above sex i think at this point wow and should i give it away  and then play the clip i don't know it i don't know it either he gets high and goes to 3d movies 
[01:27:00]  and he doesn't even give a what the 3d movie is just for the 3d and how he explains it i think i'm  finally going to start smoking you might get a little buzz then uh yes and go see that that's  not even his favorite thing he's lying he likes to smoke pot and do a headstand and jerk off into  his own mouth it's later on the episode when they stop the boat to have coffee but i think it's worth  playing here after our incredible uh movie discussion yes indeed he do really was a movie conversation for 
[01:27:30]  2014. yes well you know now that we're a media destination we really got to  fucking absolutely we'll sit down and talk about it after the oh and he hates and he hates taking  his boat under bridges what is that why i don't think it's going to happen i don't know i have it  down to a science first i buy the tickets on okay this is it go back a little bit and i put it in the  same i walked by with his dog on the leash the dog walked by with an owner on the leash i said it 
[01:28:00]  backwards and then i tried to fix it my favorite dog thing is when your dog is walking through the  room and you stop him he doesn't then continue on his way whatever you interrupted is gone it's gone  that's hilarious i go to the 3d imax movie here we go imax sorry stone or you get a scone  yes i get a scone to see a 3d imax movie you're so elegant you know if my kids have been with me  for a stretch is that inside louis boat and i have like a day between them i gotta i gotta comment on 
[01:28:30]  it he's got a sick boat all right louie no longer has a boat louie owns a ship but it's a ship yeah  it's two levels yeah yeah yeah he admits during this uh comedians in cars getting coffee with jerry  seinfeld that uh he absolutely can't afford it oh really and i think i'd believe him because i  don't know just to more that thing he was very funny in american hustle he was really good that  was funny man everyone's talking about his uh performance yeah yeah yeah the boat's amazing 
[01:29:00]  this thing uh god i think i want a boat now yeah i want to oh man talk about some  waste of money i wish gordon lightfoot would write a song about louie and his boat  he talks about how no one's on the hudson river with their boats which is true because i uh i get  to see the hudson river from time to time yeah and uh you don't see a lot of boaters out there  a lot of pleasure boaters not a lot and during this episode he's like look i'm we're the only  ones out here it's a beautiful either late spring early summer day maybe late summer i don't know 
[01:29:30]  whatever the and no one was out there it was a perfect day to be on the water i think people are  broke yeah people are probably not an easy thing to do it is what i'm imagining waving to other  people with hit tv shows yeah exactly jeremy runners going by another boat that's about it all right  so this is him saying how he likes to get stoned and go to imax 3d movies if my kids have been with  me for a stretch and then they go with their mom and i have like a day between them and some work to 
[01:30:00]  do or something smoke some pot and see a 3d imax movie you bring your own snacks or you get with  movie crap i don't get the movie crap because i don't want to buy it stoned to me talking to a  stranger when i'm stoned is like a nightmare why because you can't read the signal yeah i just can't  it's all wrong and they're looking at me like i'm crazy i think and what's worse is if people  recognize me for being a known person and come over oh my god and i'm really stoned so why do you go  to a crowded movie theater i have it down to a science first i buy the tickets online i print 
[01:30:30]  it out and i put it in the same pocket every time so i'm not doing this stone guy can't find this thing  this pocket has no other function it's got that ticket in it one ticket for one guy one ticket for  one guy i got some candy bars and treats like ice cream bar is good you put that in one pocket some  like you know maybe a mounds bar snickers you have to wear a jacket to do this right it's like a suicide  bomber here each thing is the detonators in here it's the same preparation i just get uber to car 
[01:31:00]  service to get me i like to lower the window about halfway and just look at people on the streets of  manhattan that's when you're stoned that's an amazing thing to look at people carrying their bags of stuff  and just seeing them and going we're just worms and we're just carrying our worm meal i go in and give  the lady my paper ticket and i put on the crazy glasses and i sit here and then the great thing  this is all i'm at it for they show trailers regular size and you get lost in that and then 
[01:31:30]  when it's time for the movie that screen grows yeah and they have this 3d imax countdown yeah where  the numbers come at you and develop you and it's all blue and crystal and it drives me crazy  it's my favorite thing in life it's like sex comedy when it's good sex yeah comedy yeah the blue  numbers yeah sex is starting to go and sex is dropping that's the same when the sex gets below the blue 
[01:32:00]  numbers yeah i have you know pull the ripcord that's some funny right there god damn wow louis got a nice  boat right there yeah it's pretty awesome man all right we'll uh we'll take a break we got to talk  about uh obviously the the two penis guy oh that went viral man yeah poor guy are we talking about  everything you said we would talk about on the pre-show let me see i mentioned the apologies we did 
[01:32:30]  that i'm gonna make you out to be a fibber that's right penis guy which we'll do next and getting angry  you know did that we also got to talk about somebody was at the ufc fight holy  we do have to talk about that oh i watched it on the tv so did i i rented that one i don't rent all  of them i'll be honest but i i rent like three maybe yeah maybe three a year and that one i  fucking we'll we'll talk about some stills where jim just looked like the guy in the oswald shot 
[01:33:00]  right right still pick concern jimmy i loved it so two penis guy and uh some uh ufc talk after the  break and and for the people that still don't know the show now starts at 6 30. yes sam gets everyone  going from 6 to 6 30 with a whole bunch of clips and just a fast-paced little half hour pre-show  and then when you're doing a wrap-up show too still yeah yeah the post shows at 10 30. and then  at 11 we just restart the whole thing including the pre-show uh-huh uh-oh so that means you get 
[01:33:30]  an hour yeah i had an hour before no i mean you get it on the replay yeah the show ends and then  there's an hour before they hear us again yes but i thought we started it fucking uh i thought the  show started again i think the show has to start nothing personal yeah i just want that west coast  to like you know yeah the show starts at 11 whose idea was that well what is that we got things to  figure out still yeah when the west coast was brought up i assume that uh i wouldn't even do 
[01:34:00]  an after show well no i would assume 11 o'clock is okay because sometimes we you need the 10 to 11  buffer because sometimes we go late buffers buffers you know what we could do what we could move the  show to six and then do an after show from 10 to 11 and not to pre-show at all that would be a good  idea yeah i don't know if i like that i mean it's it's kind of out of the box i like the pre-show to  start everything then we do our show then you wrap it up which is nice and then i think we got to go 
[01:34:30]  right back into the show 11 but then do the post show we definitely need to do the 11 o'clock we need  to go on yeah that's what i'm thinking yeah it's not gonna happen today but yeah going forward yeah  because i don't know we'll we'll talk we'll figure it out we're feeling our way around you know because  we're immediate destination yeah sure we'll sit down and talk about it all right we're on the  phone now no we'll talk about in person come on he's annoyed 
[01:35:00]  ah christ what's going to be the difference in person my i have a mouth and ears right right  talking oh we'll be a dick in one exactly and not the ears  mighty this is all double talk what am i buying a car from you  i've got a real answer i'm a very straight shooter it's easy right but i say that i'm  called negative on the phone you could hear you could ask questions it's amazing communication  i have a feel like this is just give me the same 
[01:35:30]  for the new coat of paint that's it but i was asking a very logical question something that's  you know important to me well i guess he's got to talk about person yeah sit down sit down we're  gonna make it new it's gonna feel good people call and i talk to them how do we  freshen that up right should we have to do impressions of celebrities oh here's a guy  that sounds like chris walken oh jim i can't quit drinking oh  thank you for printing this out in large font so i can read it clearly without my glasses

[01:37:00]  10 teams of four people and they each get 20 and they each get 20 guesses hey who likes ball basket  uh basketball you told them  this game is it's kind of awful words back words back backwards oh it's a play on words wow 
[01:37:30]  you want to book a read god take your time i'll just sit here with my feet up i get 20 guesses yeah  so is everybody on your team now you would need at least 40 people to play this at a party it's  easy at my parties oh really play some words back 40 people 20 guesses if you need help from your  partners you shout pass play pass play pass play you gotta shout pass play pass play chip was texting 
[01:38:00]  sam on new year's eve no on christmas eve christmas eve this is what you have to deal with i was  having dinner with my family and chip kept sending me different words packs pass play pass play pass  play oh is that what you have to yell i forgot about that jesus pass play pass play pass play  because i tried to go with them and i said then the loser gets covered in green paint because they're  envy with green oh green with envy no chip responded huh i don't know what you mean pass play pass

[01:39:00]  figure out shit on the fly we're trying to figure out some replays and stuff so nothing is set in  stone today i just went in to talk to tim but he was on the phone he is here so uh tim if you're  listening to this let's talk on one of the break he's gonna call me later but i'm like i'm busy every  day after the show like let's just talk on the next break okay that sounds good and we're uh we're  starting the show at 6 30 these days sam's doing a pre-show then he does a post-show and then we got  to figure out what to do after the post-show do we go back into the pre-show or do we do the actual 
[01:39:30]  show that's ridiculous so we're so what you hear today might be uh changed i don't know we got we got  some things i gotta look at a a grid because the other thing is the other thing that is really  important people like all right now that you guys have the channel you gotta make the show start  at five where we left off at nine that's another thing we have to figure out a lot of people bitch  that what they would hear the same part of the show on on their commute right because it's like a it's 
[01:40:00]  blocked out for four hours so if you spend eight hours at work you're in the same exact spot so what  you want to do is these people go to work at nine they turn off the fucking show and within reason  when they get back in their car you know they're gonna they're gonna pick up uh from where they kind  of left off right you know how you can tell we're a media destination because instead of using the  two weeks off to figure this out we decided to do it for a show back on the air yeah well yeah that's 
[01:40:30]  what we do that's what we get destination let's uh let's uh let's say hi to jim in virginia uh jim  what's up hey uh guys that was a long time listener here i was just wondering why i have to listen to  this homo who should be on the own q channel for 30 minutes what's the own q channel that's a good  question well you don't what what happened there he's mad because you're forcing him to listen to me 
[01:41:00]  yeah gunpoint starting to think wow these people don't really have flies yeah well they do have  ears but why wouldn't you take that time to go maybe listen to something else you might enjoy  i don't understand that how much how much of us do you need a lot it's five hours of original content  every day and then they're like well what do we do for the rest of the day oh my god it's gotta be  sorry there's gotta be a secondary thing you might want to take a peek at no or to explore the 
[01:41:30]  platform yeah i'm uncomfortable by how much people need us oh very needy  uh uh wake up a little later let's say hi to alex in dc alex hello hello hello happy new year  welcome uh glad to hear you guys back thank you thank you alex it's good to be back  anthony i give you a week before you go postal bro over this bullshit opinion on the fly

[01:42:30]  a glitch whoops well can we change that today no i mean i this is what changes  hit play is half hour earlier just unplug the goddamn thing it's not the whopper yes no i yeah  we can of course we could i don't know we'll figure it all out yes power chipper you know that  will just want to kill everybody oh yeah we'll have we'll have all this figured out by march don't  you worry don't worry don't worry just in time for jocktober but i guarantee that the studio will not 
[01:43:00]  be done by no no no i guarantee that what day in march for what the studio march first or march 30th  no no no this will it will not be done in march the entirety of march so you're giving it until march  31st not done no there's no way wow we all know that yeah it's okay though it's all right yeah yeah  big monitor  good monitor you just seen and slamming that monitor down oh did i not want to deal with that 
[01:43:30]  monitor i was playing a clip and it doesn't need as many things done in here as i do and but that  that thing is driving it nuts driving me bat every morning i gotta push it down and the mount isn't  right to be pushed down so it's gotta go sideways it just is a pain in the end well you haven't been asking  for a year no um larry in minnesota larry larry in all fairness before you talk the guys in the 
[01:44:00]  other room wrote he is a loser and a truck driver and he listens to ona all day every day go ahead  larry what's up like i'm a loser no i didn't know not you yeah oh oh travis is saying he's a self-described  loser oh you're a self-described loser oh that's nice all right  yes would you like to speak with us  because our listeners don't have the greatest social skills no no no you think 
[01:44:30]  all that and he hung up i gave a great setup and he just hung up  oh black ice jimmy look at that yep people sliding off the oh here's your worst nightmare  oh see it well and then they just you know yeah it's just back to the news why would you  show the crash when you throw three people on chairs i'd rather see three people on high chairs  and a lady an umbrella with a giant umbrella yeah exactly your falling balls were falling yeah you 
[01:45:00]  see the smoke from that high-rise fire yeah i used to live like that i used to live a half a block  from there that's 43rd street to stand oh okay i was halfway down that block wait it was on the same  block as you when i used to live yeah i mean i know that building well yeah wow damn yo and the guy  died because he didn't stay in his apartment what happened the stairs were on fire like he died in  the stairwell i think it was uh the smoke smoke inhalation yeah he probably would have been fine 
[01:45:30]  inside you know a lot of the they got the high rises figured out when it comes to these fires  and it sounds crazy but a lot of times you're supposed to stay put in your in your apartment  he lost his mind a little gotta get out of there they figured out with these buildings how to keep  the fire contained to that that apartment or that area and this guy i guess he panicked went in the  stairwells and that i guess well and that's why he died i guess if you're in that apartment you should  leave though the one that was engulfed in flames i got the story right that's how he died right  in the stairwell yeah but i mean he he panicked a little bit i don't know what it was that got 
[01:46:00]  him like that's scary by the way when you're that high up on oh damn how many apartments were lost i  wonder it looked like it was pretty much contained but it was a that fire was pretty intense when you  know on that one floor i'm sure there's plenty of smoke and water damage yeah they'll be digging out  of that for a while yeah that's a little scary though being up in a building fire  oh that i love this this guy has actual ideas for the west coast time schedule all right all right 
[01:46:30]  cool let's uh get all the advice we can we'll sift through it people so don't want to hear this oh  crap yes go ahead eric hey uh good morning uh but maybe he comes up with something sorry wrong show  what hey why don't you guys go old school for the west coast to me can you and just do like the best of  from like billy burr's rants and patrice and all that stuff 
[01:47:00]  you know i i i literally didn't think there could be a worse suggestion  jimmy's eyes it's oh it's been so much fun to watch so you're saying he's gone though yeah  how does that solve our problem we want we want to get the new content out there oh we got a podcast  for the old content what's the solution play patrice and bill burr clips and they're the best of good 
[01:47:30]  great idea for the west coast for the west coast yeah yeah terrible idea the west coast maybe we  should have a channel i'm hoping the west coast wants to hear our new stuff i'm hoping that we still  have something to give well maybe the west coast hasn't heard patrice and bill burr yeah yeah yeah  just play that just for the west coast how's our podcast doing we haven't been able to promote it  did all right yeah yeah don't forget every wednesday we have uh our podcast oh yeah pops up and that is 
[01:48:00]  where we do take advantage of uh what 10 years of satellite radio the archive and we put it up there for  you but what do we do for the west coast with the podcast i don't know that's a very very  very very oh wow the numbers dipped a bit during the holiday huh look at that oh that number uh-oh  it dipped a bit oh we're still doing fine doing all right it dipped a bit in the same way that air 
[01:48:30]  egypt did  that's not the holidays numbers are still actually very good okay one is family stories one is best of  2013 and the best of chip chipperson i understand oh on the podcast oh yeah i don't think so be a  billion i was thinking uh we obviously have to give uh jim orton his due no i don't know is there  going to be a podcast with all jim norton's you guys hear me every day i i like i don't need that  honestly you're gonna have that i don't know if you're gonna have that i mean plus i mean how you 
[01:49:00]  know if you give bill burr one and patrice a few we'll give jim norton 12 hours  justin stangle just texted me with a good uh yeah he's being constructive oh okay he says what  about people listening in mountain time that's true too maybe we just throw them away they're  nothing just blew up right go back to the ground really pays attention to the mountain people no  they should know they get fucked those are that's an untapped resource they just get 
[01:49:30]  fucked all around they know if they just figure it out on their own they know they have no one  looking out for them yeah yeah mountain time is fucked up  hope you're going to get a are you going to get a prescription for the medical weed nice i think  they're talking about that for now i'll go in new york i'm all about illegal weed gotta go illegal  if you're gonna smoke the colorado was loving their uh their new legal weed huh but all those  businesses that opened up so they were all just growing plants illegally and we're hoping for the 
[01:50:00]  best hoping uh could you see some of these suppliers they were all ready all ready to go  yeah they weren't exactly like well we got a plant now you would think if they're legalizing pot that  yeah there would be a planting season yeah you see those warehouses they were ready ready to rock  that shit was illegal right yeah what happened and what they're just saying ah whatever it's cool  yeah yeah they uh they're digging their legal weed up and now cuomo looks like an idiot so he's he's 
[01:50:30]  basically saying that we're going to allow some medical weed uh to come into new york state finally  i think this is a big distraction get the people uh all hopped up on the dope right and uh it'll keep  them uh mellow you know and then they'll look at the news and see other countries falling apart and  be like i don't care i'm gonna smoke some weed aren't they already smoking weed though no i think this 
[01:51:00]  will make it like yeah you know more people smoke weed because it's legal and then what about like  everyone's concern is for the goddamn children all the time right what what kind of safety measures are  being taken um as far as storage in the home goes and stuff to make sure that uh the children aren't  getting their hands on this weed well it's like everything else in your house yeah you know how  much dangerous you got in your house if you're a parent i know but there's always like you know  they always got like psa's and things maybe you know yo chill that chill out man i like this pot thing 
[01:51:30]  i think there's children you're going to see some kids uh showing up at the hospitals with a little  weed in their system they'll be like oh they found some of this i think they've already had a couple  cases already did they yeah i believe so but did you they went through the whole thing how you get  your weed yeah and they got like baristas do they what do you want what kind of buds you want  i'm selling marijuana they kind of do though they got those guys like all right well if you take this 
[01:52:00]  fucking thing here you know oh they're all the pros they know all the lingo right yeah they got those  guys in there and then they uh they seal the bags before you leave the store childproof bags oh yeah  they seal that with that big yeah but you gotta open it up sometime true open it up at home you  get stoned you leave it out on the table now you dog ate it but when you're stoned you're very  responsible and you make sure everything is taken care of around you right mm-hmm i don't know 
[01:52:30]  i don't know i bet there i bet some problems start cropping up no pun yeah just saying i could give a  shit quite frankly it's interesting i think we're many years away from uh the the country legalizing  it yeah i think a few few more states will you know get involved but i don't know is there i don't  think it's going to be as that's not going to be as easy on the east coast no i wonder why they're  more liberal here it's so weird that it isn't already no way it's going to be as easy 
[01:53:00]  i think you get montana involved montana will fall yeah yeah what about live free or die  not so much i would think they'd be for it maybe yeah they might be the accept exception what about  massachusetts no fucking no two shits yes i heard it pennsylvania massachusetts connecticut 
[01:53:30]  new york that's gonna be tough those are gonna be tough now why they're the libby states i know but  they're just gonna be tough i don't get it well are there warning labels on this weed  anything you need a prescription not drive no not in colorado oh right you just buy it for fun now  it's for fun do they put anything on there like hey don't smoke this and drive operate heavy machinery  we probably should have had like a pot expert to talk about the colorado situation yeah that would 
[01:54:00]  have been smart the ins and outs of getting your weed in colorado black market weed is cheaper than  legal stuff no that's good what come on dude here talk to them hey hey our experts eric  yes you are you believe me i know it's a no but but considering the legal stuff it's three three to  four times the price of black market yeah because it's legal but if you get caught with the black 
[01:54:30]  market stuff same shits same uh penalties right meaning none it's like you're going to pay more  for uh prescription pills you don't have a prescription for from somebody down the street  than you will you know right right but and they are having problems uh some of the veterinary clinics  and some of the children pediatric hospitals with little kids and with pets already that have gotten  a whole yeah they've had that they've been having that problem ever since the medical marijuana  was legal out here man all right yeah i've got several friends who smoke pot who are like 
[01:55:00]  the legal we'll just go buy it from our dealer i'm not paying 400 for for an ounce yeah i don't blame  you and then if you get caught with it like with illegal stuff no one knows it's illegal so it's just  weed you just have to have a prescription for it no it's legal in colorado legal how do you feel about  this it's it's just weird it's weird right yeah because we've been alive through the whole  thing of no way you can't smoke weed not being legal yes and two water fountains 
[01:55:30]  we all remember reefer madness yes that will make you do crazy and now it's legal  yeah it was uh i mean you know it's just odd that colorado they're smoking and then some states you  know people still going to prison for a long time pretty tough weird thing people right very strange  um speaking of smoking uh did you see the new um quit smoking ads for new york oh god wait a minute 
[01:56:00]  is it you haven't seen ones no i think i was watching an odd couple no you would know you would  know yeah yeah yeah yeah they're now showing people they're now showing people at the end of their lives  because they smoked their whole lives it goes on and on and on and on it's the longest hacking  thought those people gurgling i'm not a smoker that's terrible my family none of us really smoke  fuck those people  why is that allowed but if god forbid you say fuck on tv or show a nipple or or make some racial 
[01:56:30]  joke yes all hell breaks loose but this is okay are you kidding me i'm trying to watch the odd couple  and every commercial break that came up a get a big downer dude these commercials are the most horrific  thing i've ever seen on broadcast uh television wow she's it ain't that one is it i don't know it's  just some person like the one i saw it's n yc quits you would know when you see it and then you got the  the husband trying to take care of the wife she's in bed with uh just gurgling gurgling basically and 
[01:57:00]  like gans says it goes on and on and on why is that acceptable i don't know i guess it's a health  thing that that's that that's their point probably well well it's encouraging but isn't that  yeah it's more horrifying for for you know i would think for children and everyone else who's  who might be taking a peek at the tv yeah i think it's scary yeah what are these oh it is them  let's see one of the quitting no no no oh one with a kid i didn't see that one showed up 
[01:57:30]  that's good oh god the guy at the mirror now go with the hall yay is that the only ones we got  smoke ciggies keep going i'll tell you the one i saw it's the it's the wife in bed with the husband  just like oh wow that's a lung missing in that x-ray which one you want to play ah let's just go to the  bed one first what the heck is a kid and a lady in bed this little couple 
[01:58:00]  black woman she's having a little breathing can you make it bigger sound like this  dying from smoking isn't quick and never painless as her kid is giving her water and holding her hand  she has emphysema obviously that's her name too when smoking leads to cancer you and your family  can suffer every minute of every day more than 846 000 americans are living with the misery 
[01:58:30]  that wasn't that bad that one not as bad as uh let's show the coffee guy old codger he's probably 20.  he looks like the meat fucking stare in the gym sounds like edgar  why is this acceptable but we lose our minds if we see a nipple or or cursing on tv it doesn't make 
[01:59:00]  sense by the way the number they just gave is different for americans living with cancer  hmm is it did they say like 800 and something in the first one i don't know i wasn't paying  attention on the number go to this one i was horrified spitting his lungs up in the sink  wait go back a little bit sam to the end of it i'll bash your teeth it says  hold on no no like just keep rewinding it shows it oh rewind a little bit sweetie oh um 
[01:59:30]  sam you're ruining everything wait let's see 285 000 americans are living with the misery of lung cancer  caused by smoking go to the end of the first one oh different number i think by a lot maybe it  increased uh i find that well no that's the people dying from the lung cancer are living with the  misery of cancer caused by smoking and what was the difference one was lung cancer or one was  specifically lung cancer and that's all the cancers you deal with if you're if you're a long-term smoker 
[02:00:00]  oh how about another hacking uh spot there i the old white couple is the one that was  brutal these are all i don't know what that is what's the ones that don't have any pictures  yeah let's yeah come on sam and here in new york you're trying to enjoy some football games  you're pretty pumped up to great games and then this comes on you're like really  yeah it makes you not want to smoke though oh that's true  well we all have to deal with this there it is 
[02:00:30]  i think anyone ever wants to visit him  yeah they got some great actors for these spots oh jesus wow do you think anyone wants to go to  his house and hey how you doing the camera crew even set up behind him yeah oh man people who talk 
[02:01:00]  to him must love text messaging that's gotta suck go up a couple hold on what's um that one no down  one of these that one that's why we just that's okay sorry one of these dopey news uh heads talk  about this these are deeply disturbing if you're worried about uh you know disturbing people  maybe it'll be your content yeah yeah gotta let junior know smoking bad yeah because kids go what's 
[02:01:30]  that that's what happens if you smoke they won't smoke damn well can't you just like maybe maybe  there's a place on the computer you could go to these things are popping up a lot what's the stroke  one what's that one it's just black there's no picture of the esponial video is what private it's  a private why is it a private smoking video for who not for you for who you can't see it only  big special people tobacco oh yeah it laughs i'm mocking them well anyway that's emphysema

[02:03:30]  yeah yeah make some money it's all about the money weed some casinos some fucking prostitution we'll be  back in uh great shape as a powerful nation in no time right online gambling is now completely  acceptable uh well in what jersey maybe a few places now yeah yeah nevada but what what about it being  bad for everybody but then they figured out how to make the money and they said yeah and said 
[02:04:00]  that the illegal online gambling was bad i heard they're having a problem in jersey it like kicks  you off and should it was bad they they were trying to say they're protecting the individual  but it was bad because they weren't making the money or making money period yeah i don't give a  fuck about the individual well they say they were protecting you from uh unethical practices oh so  if they're if the state's running it right then it's going to be great oh really yeah yeah will they  be able to figure out how to make that business make that website work well actually they haven't in 
[02:04:30]  jersey there's some problems uh you'll be playing a game and it'll throw you off and say you are  not a resident of new jersey like your ip will change and it'll throw you off the game are you  gonna be doing some online gambling now i can not new york if you could i mean if i could yeah i used  to but i used to do it through uh you know the the old companies were they were a little unethical  in their practices but i kind of got them back anyway i remember they sent me this email and said 
[02:05:00]  uh hey your bank um denied payment on uh like two thousand dollars um could you please like send it to  us and i said uh no so and then the whole thing came down where the fbi served them and everything  and just shut everything down i'm like all right wow you lose wow yeah whoops  fall come yep we got uh derek in long island his uh buddy just came back from colorado wants to 
[02:05:30]  talk about all the edible weed stuff he came back he came back but see here's another problem a lot of  people are going to be transporting this shit to places that you're not allowed to have they were  trying to explain that right out of the box they're like hey it's legal in colorado but don't  fucking go over the the the state line with it going to jail of course you are but i wonder how  many people got fucked with that this guy went over there to become a teacher because he couldn't get  a job in new york so he goes there and now he's got a car he comes back he's got fucking gummy bears 
[02:06:00]  and chocolate bars and it's funny because like in the in the nutrition fact it says like thc and calories  and protein all that shit and he's going uh these chocolate bars he's like you eat one of them and  you're on your fucking edge he doesn't care how much weed you smoke to be one of those bars because  you're done and he brought it back with him in a car huh no i'm guessing on a plane on a plane see  that's going to be an issue you are going to see an increase in people getting in trouble hey what 
[02:06:30]  happened it's legal it's legal it's a fucking gummy bear it doesn't matter they're going to know what  the fuck that looks like and smells like right you know and they don't have the same uh attitude about  it either no but they will ask sam would sam try edible gummy bears since it's not a crazy food  and it's not technically smoking a drug but he doesn't do any the company won't let us  fucking grab tits they're gonna let sam do a fucking a drug but the thing is though they're 
[02:07:00]  gonna have to cut down and be lenient with that shit because so many people will just like have  it like in a lollipop or whatever eating at the airport it's just yeah yeah i'm saying nothing  yeah i i just uh i think i wish it wasn't legal because for me it's tempting but i know i can't do  it so good luck to all people who can't enjoy it it's obviously going to turn people on to  the fucking drugs duh that's what i mean the government don't give a they figured out how  to finally make money out of it i kind of liked it illegal you know it was kind of fun you had 
[02:07:30]  to find a dealer and felt a little dangerous oh i'm smoking weed yeah i like the danger yeah yeah  a little dangerous i'm a bad boy a little secret signal you go you see someone you make you got any  you got any yeah yeah like that now it's like um just going to the store now you're doing that whole  foods yeah it sucks um i gotta take my giant out and pay who's on the phone oh uh caroline or carol

[02:11:00]  the talk with tim go uh jimmy cool uh it said on the air that i wanted him to come down uh he might  not he was on the phone so maybe he didn't make he didn't make it down oh hopefully he'll come down  on the next break we could talk for a few minutes i only need two minutes because he said we'll figure  it out i'm just gonna go okay it's wednesdays for an hour how do i do it right and hopefully he'll be  able to tell me you think there's an answer no of course there's not but like jimmy's show but this is 
[02:11:30]  all new now yeah and different yeah it doesn't really feel different in here no it doesn't feels the  same look around pick monitor yeah yeah um i just gotta say the mike tyson book i finally really  really dove into it i read you know a little bit here and there yeah but then with the time off i  really dove in because it's like 580 pages i think i got 50 pages to go what a great read yeah 
[02:12:00]  what a crazy great read he is not i can't i i i guess anyone that writes a book they're holding  back some stuff uh-huh but i can't imagine what he's holding back because yeah you think wow he  just put it all out there he was just a full-blown addict for most of his boxing career and and then  beyond obviously just what was he doing uh coke oh really jesus that guy on coke oh my god a lot of 
[02:12:30]  coke a lot of weed and a lot of drinking he a lot of girls and his and his uh criminal record yeah  i mean we heard the stories here and there in the press over the years sure a lot of this was never  even reported really his criminal record it's unbelievable were you amazed at the amount of  coke he did i was blown away how much drugs ruined his career i was blown away i had a discussion over 
[02:13:00]  the break how sad it really is because i think his i think his record was in the end 50 and four was  it 51 and four somewhere i want to say he lost six i think he lost four now i might have to challenge  you on that hold on he lost to buster douglas he lost lewis he lost to lennox he lost to holyfield he  lost all he filled again you're you know what i i'm i'm an asshole today yeah yeah you're right six because  then yeah big white guy at the end mcbride and then just another another no name he lost his last  two fights you're right he lost twice to holyfield 50 and six all right yeah sorry jimmy that's okay 
[02:13:30]  who was the one right before kevin mcbride though because i didn't remember his name it's just some  who gives a guy danny williams danny williams yeah he lost his last two fights and then the famous i  don't want to fight anymore and then after that fight he just went around the world pouring his balls off in  russia yeah where else did he go he's just royalty everywhere he goes right but he got on some jewish  guy's yacht and then just sailed the world basically for like six months or something partying hard 
[02:14:00]  every night raping on the open seas but uh i found it so sad because if he was 50 and six he should have  never lost the obviously pretty much any of those fights because he wasn't he wasn't in shape for  lennox lewis he wasn't in the greatest shape for the holy field fights and then two losers beat him  at the end of his career that should never happen that guy could have been who the f  70 80 and maybe one or two tops yep he really uh he wrecked his crew of drugs i couldn't believe 
[02:14:30]  how much coke he did three years in jail at the prime of his uh fighting what how old was he in jail  we forget now yeah he was 21 when he won the i want to say in 89 he was probably 24 20 now maybe 26 i'm  guessing something like that 26 27 28 in jail probably somewhere younger than that maybe travis do we have  those i'm looking okay the book i can't put it down it's one of those where you you don't want the 
[02:15:00]  chapters to end you just page after page a famous you know it's a page it's amazing it really is i saw him at  ufc and i walked over and said hello and of course he's just he's really nice when you meet him oh and  uh you know he likes our show and he loves and he was just so sweet and that's cool dude  all the greatest book was and then he was talking about how he pretty much made close to a billion  dollars in his career and then ah he had nowhere to live how the is that we didn't hear those stories 
[02:15:30]  really until this book came out he basically had nowhere to live 26 27 and 28 he was 26 27 and 28  he literally blew it all and then the fights with don king i i always knew he didn't like don king but  he literally would beat the out of him really don king would keep coming back for more because he knew  he could get money from the guy how amazed were you at the money that uh he could have waited a little bit  but he filed for bankruptcy and don king like the payment for 14 million dollars 16. oh why am i  correcting you no that's right within the ballpark yeah i literally just read that out of 100 million right 
[02:16:00]  he could have they were talking he was going to settle for close to a hundred million and they  said you can't declare bankruptcy because then don king will get a will skate and he just had to i  guess and uh and because of that don king only had to pay 16 million in the end instead of probably  close to 100. man he got out of a lot of cash unbelievable but the amount of sex the guy had  the amount of partying the amount of the amount of coke he said he was walking around with bricks 
[02:16:30]  which if he got caught that but that's like a you know a life sentence right oh yeah he got pulled  over uh the car broke down and the cops like he had a brick of coke on him in a bag right but the  cops pulled they're like hey mike they were so happy they dropped him off at a cocaine party one time  they didn't know where he was going and he goes i goes i walked in the two cops were so happy they  walked me up to the door like hey we brought mike tyson treat him right make sure he gets home safe  and mike goes then everybody just left because nothing ruins a coke party like two cops right no 
[02:17:00]  shit and and uh yeah it's in it's in his voice this book obviously you can just feel oh as you're  reading on these stories yeah yeah but i mean the difference between having an eight ball and a brick  is like night and night and day as far as charges go and he wouldn't want to take he was doing that  much that he had to walk around with a brick what about when he was on the yacht and the cops came  on board yeah and he had a shitload of pot how much pot did he have in there i remember but he put it 
[02:17:30]  under a naked girl what a brilliant move so the cops are just you know on the on the yacht just staring  at the naked broad sunbathing and not knowing that she has a shitload of pot under her story after  story and you're like there's no way he has more stories to tell and then you turn the page it's another  ridiculous crazy story where his friends that how many of them are dead in jail and it's  it's a it's by far that i loved aussie's but i mean aussie's was like not like the amount of  crime criminal activity this is by far the best biography i've read there's not a dead spot in 
[02:18:00]  the whole book even from the beginning childhood stuff is great unbelievable i highly recommend it i  know he was on promoting it but now that i'm really really digging in what a great read i'm just happy  i'm reading again finally and the sex addiction was amazing like the stuff about him all these girls  and about the jerking off and like and like all of this pornography like all the stuff that he talks  about like as a sex addict you read that you're like oh my i've never heard anybody put it more 
[02:18:30]  real and more accurately uh than than tyson did he talks about like he would bang abroad and then she  would leave and then he would have to like deal with her moisture still in the bed just showing that  like he just didn't want anything to do with that person whatsoever just how he described it he was  getting everyone pregnant the guy's got like i don't how many different he had 45 girlfriends at  one point or something what all over the world and i absolutely because everywhere he went they would  just him right and he had a lot of children man dating a hooker while she was hooking right when he was 
[02:19:00]  down and out he was dating a prostitute like she would go out and turn tricks or he would take her to turn  train it's just fascinating he's got kids too like a lot like yeah i want to say close to like eight  from many different women though i think he had two from one horse woman then he has like you know  whatever a lot damn such a good book i was in jail my cellmate was mike tyson's coke dealer 
[02:19:30]  yeah i don't know if this is true let's say hi to chris in maryland uh chris yeah i was uh in mcc new  york uh and the cellmate was this black guy and he had all these pictures of mike tyson's and mike tyson's  uh trainers and boxers and he used to tell me about how you could take all this coke up to the training  camp and uh this was back 85 86 and uh it was doing massive amounts of coke back then i didn't really 
[02:20:00]  believe the guy but apparently it was true oh god it's all over this book so yeah he's not denying  that he did a lot of coke i mean a lot he might have done more coke than anybody ever right and a  lot of his fights he was he just wasn't prepared for and we're still beating the out of these guys  can you imagine a guy that was completely focused what kind of record he would have had but he also  got bored by the whole thing he talks about that he just didn't want to fight anymore oh he was he was  just done with it yeah but he had to pay his bills oh yeah so they kept lining up fights and then he 
[02:20:30]  would just go through the the money he he said he had a how many cars at one point he had so many cars  he didn't even know where the keys were he said he didn't even know where the keys were and then he  was buying cars for everyone left and right yeah rolls's and mercedes and for girls and girls and  there's guys from uh what the you know the neighborhood remind me of myself yeah 
[02:21:00]  on a much lower level though i think you're buying everyone cars no not at all okay  buy lunch every once in a while that's nice that's nice definitely imagine your friends just buying you a  fucking rolls yeah i wish i was friends with tyson like 97. oh he tells the story he goes into this  car dealership uh in la and with a bunch of his uh you know his boys boys and they all look like they  you know have no business being in this place i'm certain and so like a young kid comes up because you 
[02:21:30]  know he's just a young go-getter all the other like car salesmen are like oh this guy ain't wasting my  time on this and and tyson turned around i believe if i'm not mistaken he bought six rolls royces from  this guy and the guy was like promoted to pretty much running the joint afterwards yeah six rolls  was it six i believe you're right six rolls royces he says i'll take them all what he's basically said  what do you have in you know in stock right now that's some serious cash yeah i did like that yeah 
[02:22:00]  yeah no you didn't but it's a great read unbelievable man but the best i've ever read  i could not stop reading it because you see a book like 580 pages like  fuck can't they edit this shit down a little bit but now you understand yeah it's a it's a ridiculous  page turner i hope for the soft soft uh cover he does additional material like like there's a whole 
[02:22:30]  thing about him breaking down and making up with that guy that trainer right and uh you know there's  been a whole lot of stuff since i think the book which i would love to read about what happened  after and what he bullshitted about because he was open about that right i hope he's sober now for his  sake you know and he was just beating the out of people left and right left and right he's having all  sorts of altercations in real life he would fight people in real life all over the place what is he  he was crazy that's insane and then he explains all the girls that were looking for a payday 
[02:23:00]  yeah a lot of girls looking for that payday you know claiming all sorts of shit and like jimmy said  on the show right around when tyson came in i i'm with you there's no way uh he raped uh  desiree washington oh yeah he got fucked with his lawyers and everything that was so disturbing to read  absolutely he got fucked big time that terrible tax attorney don king's tax attorney right a tax attorney  took on his case his rape case biggest fighter on earth jesus christ that's not good and don king 
[02:23:30]  was charging michael's what was the number for the towels i forget how 8 000 a week for towels or  something it really was a bit more than towels should cost how is that guy still like  even in the business he's a smart guy a great talker and we interviewed him how charismatic well  yeah i know but at some point if you somebody over charisma kushmisma i'm gonna cave your head in yeah but  he did some caving in his own right then he he killed two right because i think in the book he 
[02:24:00]  says i i got two i have no problem getting three there's one something like that is quoted in the  book tyson the king okay yeah fuck i think he killed two people yeah jesus yeah even though you know the  story fuck is going on with these people even we've all heard the don king stories over the years but when  he came in he was awesome yeah he was great love the guy a couple times yeah he was great i mean if 
[02:24:30]  he took me for millions and millions you know one behind the ear well tyson beat the out of him a few  times kicked him in the kicked him in the head as don king's driving a car and don't he drops him off  on the highway all right i'm like what more and more stories i remember as we just sit here kicked  him all he's driving the car just really hard so king was able to get him out of the car and there's  tyson on the side of the highway with one of his bodyguards and that's where the cops came i think 
[02:25:00]  yeah and he had the coke on him at that point oh that's great it's unbelievable dude i i love this  book love it but it's kind of depressing yeah guy with that much talent and he was just had demons  the entire time yeah i could literally interview him every day yeah yeah and then also one other  thing which i've found fascinating throughout the book you realize that like people didn't really know  at times who he was did you catch that in the book what do you mean with like clubs and walking around 
[02:25:30]  the street and stuff yeah you just assume everyone would know who mike tyson is yeah so go get it  wow we watched uh i saw i see you once over the break and when we first break yes and uh we watched  a little biography on uh a bit of hugh hefner yeah we're watching hugh hefner and uh the other one and  uh bob guccioni yeah guccioni two separate documentaries that were on and uh like two old queens just  just sitting on the sofa petting a cat watching documentaries it's fucking the worst i'll have a 
[02:26:00]  pretzel it's on vacation and uh hey chill out people think we have amazing lives it's amazing  it was so fucking not that i would only see if i'm bored but i mean i was like that's great right  and i have such a respect for hefner now and what he did for free speech but anyway i watched the ali  fight because he was out of boxing and he fucking that the foreman fight and at the end of the  fucking foreman ali fight i never i mean the i never watched the uh press conference and he's sitting  there in his dressing room i told you i was the best i told you so that elijah muhammad and muslim

[02:28:30]  so we have uh two penis guy yes all right that was the big story he did uh ama  yeah oh oh huh it's gonna piss off people but we we talked to ufc you you were there for the  fucking leg break why haven't we talked about this we were there we were in the front row that's where  you saw tyson yeah that's all i went over and said hello to him and uh he was really just give me a  nice big hug very nice man yeah but uh yeah we saw the uh the fucking you and kenny were there me and 
[02:29:00]  kenny and we were in a row we sat like right next to vitor belfort who's fighting the winner of the  silva weidman fight so he'll be fighting chris weidman and it was so funny it was because it  was me kenny and then vitor and uh vitor was sitting with a girlfriend or his wife she's a  fucking an 11 and really hot but he kept talking to kenny and me about the fight because he just  wanted to talk to about the fight to a guy right right and the fucking kenny just because he's like 
[02:29:30]  vitor's like who do you got in this one kenny's like i don't know kenny was the fucking worst he  gave poor belfort nothing gave him nothing and uh i kept getting brazilians kept stepping on my feet  because ronaldo that soccer player was in our row oh wow and i found out that maynard from tool was  like two seats behind me and uh i don't have any photo with him because i didn't know he was there of  course oh you and uh it was a great night to fight a great fucking car to fight yeah i i watched it on 
[02:30:00]  the papers it looked amazing the travis brown knockout with those elbows yeah and uh and then  the broads ronda and misha great and match those two misha tate looked scared shitless walking into  that ring yeah it looks that's what we were talking about at my house we're like god she looks really  scared and she's trying to be cool with that katy perry roar thing i don't think i was like it ain't  working man and we all we love misha tate we love both of them she fought tougher than i like she  she was in the third round she was yeah she stayed off the ground yeah yeah yeah i don't know why 
[02:30:30]  she'd want to be on the ground ronda rousey but and ronda just came out looking like a  fucking a monster she's a fucking she's a monster it's your face imagine waking up to that after  you did something bad oh shit but joe uh but anyway the energy in those rooms anyone that's been to like  a professional fight like ron b talked about a tyson fight that he was at the energy that bill it's so  it was because there was so many brazilians at this fight because of the silver fighting the energy 
[02:31:00]  in that fucking building was it was almost uncomfortable energy and when when when tate and  and uh and rousey were about to fight you could just feel the hair on your neck standing up it was such  an event about to happen and bruce buffer's intro was fucking oh it's fucking great and uh so they fight  and then uh of course silva well before that real fast around and rousey not shaking misha tate's 
[02:31:30]  hand i love it yeah yeah yeah i love it instead of faking that she didn't have a real thing going  yeah she doesn't like her and that's that for now so and she got booed for that but she's like i don't  care i've been booed all over the world is that what she said i couldn't hear a word she said joe said  he was talking to her and he couldn't hear her oh really he joked we saw him afterwards and he said he  he could not hear her wow this close to her he couldn't hear what she was saying yeah she said  something like i've been booed all over the world because obviously she you know she was in the 
[02:32:00]  olympics like a concerned jimmy oh jimmy's in all the concerned jimmy all the silver photos  the um so anyway anderson goes up in fights and right before the fight anderson came out could they  both come out of a different way for the championship fights so where we were sitting we weren't sitting on  dana's side this time because there were all these money people there we were actually right where  the fighters enter the ring we were like five c we had you know kind of right next to anthony  bording were right by the uh ring girls too yeah right behind him yeah directly behind the ring girls 
[02:32:30]  and um you know chris anderson silva came out from the other side so he didn't run by us  but he tried to run over to where we were sitting because he wanted to i think talk to vitor belfort  but the referee made him go inside and then weidman came by us and so did rousey came right by  austin just to see these guys walking right by you when they're walking into the ring  that's crazy love it awesome so then the fight started between silva and weidman and i didn't  notice to be honest he was beating the out of him in the first round he was beating up anderson silva 
[02:33:00]  and i thought he was unconscious at one point yeah you saw that he looked like he was out on his feet  and then uh round two silva threw a few kicks i'm like all right anderson's starting to  fucking you know get his groove like he usually does after the first round of not doing much  and then i didn't notice the break i just saw him fall because he fell back directly in front of us  that where we were sitting when anderson fell back like his back came right to us and i'm like oh that's  the end of the fight and then herb dean ran over uh-huh and uh we couldn't see did you see i twittered 
[02:33:30]  a photo from my seat so you could see how close we were but all you just saw was him being surrounded  right and you could hear him yelling oh you could why oh my god just being a pussy  and the replay was showing the entire uh can you see the photo i tweeted no no that was the one kenny  took oh these fucking zelig shots with jimmy yeah no that one i took that's how close we were to the  race it's right there and they had to straighten his leg out because he was bent and they had to 
[02:34:00]  restrain it to put it on the uh the gurney to get him out of the uh thing uh-huh so when they brought  silva by where we were he wasn't screaming but he came directly by us and he was going he was like  he was just facing if you zoom in on his mouth when that in that photo that i'm in you could just see  he's like yeah yeah yeah yeah like he was just hyperventilating it was so there's nothing they could  give these guys when this in the back they gave him morphine holy yeah look at jimmy's slightly 
[02:34:30]  tilted head oh he's like you okay champ oh i felt very bad for him no and someone pointed out i'm  the only one not trying to snap a photo yeah yeah kenny's back there which is surprising because you  like your photos yeah i'm surprised you didn't go off to him that would be good if you went up to him  excuse me can i and can i get a picture there was there was nothing between me and i could have 
[02:35:00]  touched him it looks like i'm farther than i am i was actually as close to him as i'm closer than  i am to him should have grabbed his ankle and just went shaking it does this hurt unbelievable  yeah that was uh that was one of those where where no matter where you were watching that the entire room  just goes oh yeah yeah weidman you know put the block down there he was practicing for those kicks  so he was planning that foot pretty good right they said that um yeah he had been working on 
[02:35:30]  he knows how deadly those kicks are so they he did a lot of uh working on that figured out how to  bust his leg well how does kenny react when he sees something like that not nothing nothing right i've  been it's i i was in a one i thought pretty significant car accident with the guy and  and he nothing phases him he just stays deadpan the entire time then a bus scrapes the entire  side and front bumper off his car pushing us off the road and again nothing i'm like as cool as a 
[02:36:00]  cucumber it's unbelievable just as smart but nothing phases the guy in the middle of a car accident he  just like his face we got t-bone like oh i'm stumb like not screaming like a but like holy  you know like that and he's like oh and gets out and just like exchanges uh info not even mad at the  guy for hitting him because it was obviously his fault he came through a red light it's all just forms 
[02:36:30]  in his brain it's weird what do you fill in here when we came back from weird to me but the west coast  where kenny had to catch a train from uh jfk airport so we're racing through because kenny goes do you  mind if they drop me off first because i can get a train back i'm like yeah of course and we're racing  through midtown he has about 11 minutes to make his train and it doesn't look like he's going to make  it and not an ounce of panic like no wonder he doesn't care when i'm late he doesn't care if he's 
[02:37:00]  going to be late it's really strange so he didn't react at all to the leg breaking no no no i think  he did i wasn't looking at kenny i was looking at the leg break i couldn't decide which was less  pleasant but i mean yeah he reacted to that i mean that was just awful so what's gonna uh weideman's  a good fighter man but he's had two weird fights with sylvan now yeah yeah right ariel hawani who does  a really great mma guy and does a great show i saw him after the fight and he says you know the one 
[02:37:30]  downside is people are not going to give weidman his due because of the way it ended that's a great point  but he was beating the out of him in the first round he's a strong man he was it was uh watching  that i was like okay look silver's not around uh and he's still getting his ass kicked yeah long  island zone yep it's from strong island baby him and the islanders someone says so he's got a what  they put titanium in his leg or some supposedly he's not titanium i was reading up on him yesterday he's not 
[02:38:00]  retiring how do you go back into a ring and throw a kick i was going to say even if you're now yeah  obviously completely healed and even if you're well trained for that fight how do you at that  like you throw that first kick and you're like turning him into wolverine yeah exactly and he was  weird coming into the ring rogan was talking about he was stopping and crouching down and  what was that all about did joe tell you because i know you went out with joe a little bit after the 
[02:38:30]  fight we had dinner yeah i saw him twice actually when i was out there and um did he explain what  was going on with silver sorry i'm chewing i'm so hungry i was eating a sandwich i'm dying  did you say i don't know i don't know what he was why he was joe didn't know why he did that  i wonder if he was just scared or if he was praying or meditating i don't know he seemed a little  uh out of it or unsure about the fight or something i don't know in between rounds he looked  uncomfortable too he did that's gonna be a hard one to come back from uh he's saying he's not 
[02:39:00]  you want to see it again who doesn't this is like slow-mo i think oh nice wrap you around  that's what almost kicked him in the ass 
[02:39:30]  okay let me try to put some weight on this oh yeah that's not working is just great at it too  is he he's fucking action-packed commentary it really is perfect great he's got the perfect  fucking attitude and voice for it just sound everything sounds like a amazing thing going on  i went and saw him live after my hard rock show on the friday night because i hadn't seen joe's set  in years all right really funny man that dead squad show was joe ari um joey diaz and i came at the 
[02:40:00]  the very end of ari shafir and brian um red band no brian uh oh god kayla kalahad brian oh yeah and uh  i saw like the last five minutes of ari and then uh rogan went on and he really made me laugh man  he was some really funny it's just been so long since i've gotten to him to watch him but there's  a couple of bits he did that were fucking hilarious yeah yeah i was thinking about him  quite a bit how's diaz i didn't see joey he was good on uh personality wise it was good to talk to 
[02:40:30]  him but i didn't get a chance to watch his he was already done by the time i got him on once we gotta  we gotta get him back we did have joey on right yeah he's a funny dude man a few years ago at this  point all right uh we'll take our uh last break we're we go to 10 30 now i hope people know that  they'll figure it out eventually yeah all right so we'll uh finally talk about the two penis guy oh  i was teased on a pre-show you got to talk about it i know i know you can't turn me into a liar make 
[02:41:00]  a liar out of me lose the integrity of the pre-show so there's a half hour pre-show yeah there's a post  show pre-show as in as in sam is the stuff that drips out of your cock and it comes to pre  i didn't hear that joke much on twitter i didn't think so yeah oh you did actually right i did a  couple of times a little bit in between the video of the guy saying he'd the missing girl  on the news yeah okay you blew that one i didn't i mean i'm not it wasn't by myself i didn't see any of  you guys spread that said put it around like so much it's funny to me uh so

[02:42:30]  hands i can't understand where it came from it's not on his hands and it's fresh and i i can't tell  where it's coming from so i i pull him up and as i pull him up i put him in the wheelchair and i'm  looking i don't see nothing so i roll him in and as i'm checking i can smell it so i'm like oh man i see  people looking and i look at him he's got shorts on and i don't know how i missed it there's clumps  of dung just hanging at his shorts i finally get up upstairs and i'm showering but when i went 
[02:43:00]  downstairs where i took him out of the car there's a pile that must have fell out of his shorts and  it's on the sidewalk it's such a surreal moment in life to see like where we go in life it's just  there's a billion flies all over this thing and people are just staring at me going i can't  believe someone let their dog just defecate on the sidewalk stay tuned for more bedtime stories  with jim brewer the opie and anthony show is back on sirius xm best news ever

[02:45:00]  was vulgar did most people see the christmas card by now i haven't displayed my home it's phenomenal  yeah should be um we can probably put it on our on our social media what's our social media what's  that about is that something different now that we're a media destination yeah yeah well we visit our  social media destination at o and a show okay um but the rookie mistake i uh i paid a shitload of  bills oh that is how to be how to be whatever at least 12 at least where i'm filling out the checks 
[02:45:30]  because you know gotta look at that picture that's fantastic the fuck is wrong with his body  you're right it is like it's like it's almost like you took a picture of a tall person right and  just yeah yeah picture down there's some for top to bottom there's some forced perspective yeah i think  you're right but still oh my god you get that out there for the for the people um so i i 
[02:46:00]  fucking wrote out all these checks for these bills which is just paying the ass and then  as i'm licking the last envelope i went oh my god i wrote 2013. oh boy so what do you do  what would you have done well uh god yeah i'd open them up and once again i was imaginary fighting  yeah that's my new thing i imagine not imaginary fight i'm fighting with invisible people because i get 
[02:46:30]  so mad that's great when you do all these moves like you don't know what to do there's no one to  blame but yourself i don't think that would have been a problem yeah they kind of expect that i think  yeah yeah i wrote 1812 on my bills there's a lot of explaining to do that was 1860 because you know  why um um well that's what i thought too but then i the the paranoia settled in 
[02:47:00]  yeah yeah you don't wanna and i said fuck and i got a steak knife because i don't i don't have a  letter opener who does i'm fucking slicing those envelopes open and getting every check and putting  14 instead of 13 and then scotch taping the envelopes back i just wanted to go to bed  and i thought another imaginary person as i'm just mumbling to myself  take a guess who uses a letter opener oh my dad of course he does he does oh god 
[02:47:30]  try to pry his asshole open  i'm gonna stop contributing how about you start  illegal pictures from overseas exactly nobody gets me from taiwan taiwan he  goes in the bathroom with his letter opener he slices it oh i would never i would never get a letter  opener no when you find other things around the house that does the job of the letter opener 
[02:48:00]  why would you get a letter opener there are so many things that can be used as a letter  open razor blade including your finger yeah but everything my dad owns he's owned for the last 200  years right they're they're classics everything i didn't pay my uh oil bill they shut you down  yeah and it was like they really shut you down well i was out i ran out of oil oh i see and they didn't uh  they didn't uh deliver any any new oil but then it turned out i had oil in the tank anyway right

[02:55:00]  think it's fake but i think he's got two dicks no he might because i just want pictures without  the hand he might have two dicks why is his hand in this one too i can't just show it but the hands  like just pulling his pants down underneath his two dicks but is that covering anything no  all right now i'm going back to real it's like well maybe those are two genuine maybe uh-oh look  out for people people uh media destination here media destination anyone wanted to come in 
[02:55:30]  media destination oh my god we could have gotten in a jam up there the guy leading the tour looks  annoyed i think he saw it all right this is media destination we're talking about a new story i think  he saw it i don't think they did exactly we're talking about a double snack giver  that was our first opportunity at being a media destination media destination and nothing happened  we blew it we showed a bunch of people two penises oh boy we blew it that was bad so we got the uh 10 
[02:56:00]  fascinating facts from the man with two penises from his ama uh it became a reddit sensation over  the last 24 hours uh he covered all sorts of topics uh his condition is known as defalia  die value die failure makes sense die also known as double dick dude oh yeah technical terms uh number  one high school was uh hard oh well when asked if there ever was a time when he wished he had put 
[02:56:30]  uh wished he oh sorry i wished he had uh bought one penis double dick dude replied high school  when a reddit user tried to cheer him up by saying but you were the baddest motherfucker in the locker  room right he said when it first got out yeah but then it became a joke and guys immediately thought  i was gay because you know i guess i chose to have two cocks i'm going back to fake why you don't  think kids would call a kid gay if he had two dicks because he's got one dick and then if he got another 
[02:57:00]  one he loves dick a couple of those i'm going i'm going fake for this reason okay we've all been in  the locker room and it's kind of weird to walk around with one dick if you have two dicks you're  not walking around at all yeah you think you're covering up yes in high school we yes everyone  covers up but what if they're swimming or something where you have to see a dick it could sneak out and  then once one person catches a glimpse of the two dicks that's gonna that news is gonna be no high 
[02:57:30]  school kid is walking around a locker room with two dicks that's true he's covering up it's it's  not common in high school you got a pimple you lose your mind you're gonna walk around with two dicks  in the locker room yeah but if one person saw it in the locker room what if he had a double bulge  and they were like what's that all that has to happen is one person needs to see it and then the  whole high school finds out he's rocking two dicks high school or if he hooks up with some chick and  she opens her fucking yap about it and she would oh yeah because she'd be jerking one off and sucking 
[02:58:00]  the other and she'd tell everybody crazy no one was nude in the the boys locker room nude they just  weren't well what else is he saying that might all right i'm going back to fake okay two he's happy now  happy with his anatomy he's happy now happy with his anatomy okay he's not a grammar guy has he ever  considered having one of his penises removed in my mid-teens yeah he said now hell nah oh hell nah 
[02:58:30]  jam he likes his tics three most of the women and men he's been with what what nice what this is  just a sexual dude he's got two dicks he just wants to fuck whatever no waiting yeah i guess you know  there's a people who probably like suck his dick like take carnival pictures like you and your date  can each suck a dick and look at each other like hey what are we doing like two straws and a malted  yeah look the skin in the middle is like what do you want from me yeah going back to real yeah going  back to real because then that now proves why he was naked in high school okay showing them coxels 
[02:59:00]  likes the dudes put some lures in the water because i heard you  most uh of the women and men he's been with enjoy the extra penis i've been in a serious relationship  with a girl and a guy for a while now he said oh i call it monogamous because we are exclusive  she enjoys it the three girls before her enjoyed it it sort of made a few runs screaming in the past  usually the ones i get to know well before we date are cool with it i don't talk about it otherwise like 
[02:59:30]  if i'm not going to have sex with you you won't know i have two dicks lol yeah fake or real i don't  know at this point let's go real i might go real on this i don't know i want to believe there's a  hypersexual man with two penises walking around uh yes he has inserted both into the same hole  uh his two dicks are are you know pretty sizable dicks yeah above average right let's just say it 
[03:00:00]  they're fucking nice asking what it's like to have both in the same orifice he answered snug oh boy  yeah it's nice come hmm well we're gonna get to that jimmy  it's uh i like hearing the moaning from the person i'm squeezed inside of regarding one 
[03:00:30]  particular woman he said she complained later though that her cervix was cervix was poking out  and that her hole was huge she she kept coming back for more at least for three months lol more lol  this guy needs to stop lol-ing so much yeah enough of that i don't think he has confidence in what he's  saying thus then why the lol i am back to fake oh because who has confidence a  with two dicks you don't need lol if you got two dicks i'll tell you right now that's right 
[03:01:00]  he avoids public restrooms oh wow why imagine seeing him in the glory hole he's jerking off  he's poking one through oh my god everybody wins but you don't see you don't see penises in a  no no this guy's such a liar oh boy you don't see penises no in the restroom you're not looking in  the right place he used the stall uh he avoids public restrooms if i do use one i try to use the  stall and not a wall urinal he said they've been taught there have been times uh where i've had to 
[03:01:30]  use the urinal and because i have one muscle that controls my piss it lets the stream flow out of both  my dick oh so unless i pinch off one of them it comes out both and that doesn't feel good so i have  to take both out to pee yeah i've gotten stairs and even had a few guys at various times go holy  shit you don't believe them at all no no what would you say if you saw two dicks hi jim that's every 
[03:02:00]  morning are you guys buying this i don't know i don't know you don't you don't see dicks in the  rest it is a real just don't see it it is a real thing and a couple of the photos look real i didn't  like that his hand was in a lot but then there was a couple of pictures that actually looked like it  might be real both penises pee at the same time it's not tricky said i've peed from both all my life  i want to think that uh one would be crazy just atrophied probably wouldn't have a urethra in it 
[03:02:30]  you know like like to have two functioning penises like that is very i can't imagine bobo would pray  to god for either or just one just one they're both perfectly fine and why hasn't the it looks like he  likes the attention so why finally like he comes forward with this yeah i mean maybe he didn't  realize there would be such hoopla over it he's just walking around on reddit he's just trying to 
[03:03:00]  own it now and now he's sit you don't play it number seven but they usually get erect at different  times how's that possible isn't the blood in the same basic well does he mean it takes a few seconds  apart when he says different times you mean eight o'clock and then 4 30 or does he mean a minute apart  let me read on and let's try to figure this out it always starts uh that way he said the left one  starts to get semi semi first then stops at a certain point right one then gets rock hard 
[03:03:30]  and if i'm horny enough the left one will continue to stiffen up and get bigger once or twice with  cock ring on hydra they've both been equally rock hard one of the soggy five and one  of course the smaller one gets rock hard poking out like a little stiff pigtail he just has to  bang a girl and while he's banging her his limp other limp dick is just rubbing against her thigh  right right just like fall high high and she must root for the bigger one to get hard than the small 
[03:04:00]  one does she's like oh nerd she loses hmm they both come at the same time though not at the same speed  if you're working on the left one you have to suck it out he said  yeah because that's what women want god i gotta suck that come out suck out the poison gotta make  sure i get all that goodness yikes it's stuck in there you gotta suck it out right 
[03:04:30]  and then the right one launches every time and then he uses a winky face this guy is full of  launches he's being charming i can't wait for him to be shown a fraud yeah that would be nice  do you know girls that want to suck it out oh man you gotta gotta suck it out hey i came  but now i need to suck it out theoretically it would be like a snorkel the other one would be sucking in 
[03:05:00]  air right right oh god in the middle there yeah not all you can then blow and then blow the gist out  the other dick yeah it'd be like a  not all of his sexual partners believe both penises are real  the reaction varies from girl to girl he said a fallacy  uh-huh some have been like wow some have been like that's fake some have freaked out like called 
[03:05:30]  me names most are pretty curious but i don't have casual sex anymore in the past girls were nervous  and some changed their mind at the last minute dudes never change their mind they always wanted even  if they're freaked out a little lol i'm more lol guy laughs out loud a lot  guys just pigs one dick two dick three dicks just put them in me 
[03:06:00]  but i like studying this he the lols come after the most outrageous  shit almost like uh i don't know if you're gonna buy this i better add a little something here yeah  i'm just being cheeky oh and then finally yes he does have a favorite penis hey the right one he  said the left one has a a grudge against me for it too what the left one has a grudge against me for  it too yeah the grunt the left my favorite is the right one the left one has a grudge against me for 
[03:06:30]  it too for it also he means yeah okay i gotcha lol more lols this guy's a teenage girl let's go around  the room i i'll start i think this is fake and it's gonna take a few days because everyone's  talking about this hard to say hard to say man i said fake originally but then there are a couple  of pictures that are yeah yeah they kind of look real yeah didn't look like there was a prosthetic  the bathroom him saying he avoids uh restrooms that's yeah that's a little weird you're just not 
[03:07:00]  seeing um you're not seeing i'll go real he's gotta pull two out and pinch one down and i don't know  go to my twitter there's a link to a bunch of what i think i found a quote that is makes me think  false okay what the i said wasn't good enough for you yeah i stopped looking for other people  your friends the just more evidence that supports your argument oh okay uh what's the most interesting  reaction you've had to somebody seeing your double dome they kicked it like it was a they started 
[03:07:30]  kicking it like it was a scorpion um he writes a hunky muscle dude at the gym i was at oh i was working  out in my jock strap and shorts oh okay and shorts just slipped out and the shorts were very baggy and  loose and i fell out of my jock on either side and somehow he noticed oh christ we wasted time on 
[03:08:00]  this yeah he asked me in the locker room if he could please see them i asked him are you gay or something  and he said no but i think i am now it was great that is a made-up story two dicks turn guys gay  is that what happens travis travis travis i i only found out about this yesterday oh all right  travis has been trying to cut an extra hole in his i i thought oh boy did you ever sorry yeah travis 
[03:08:30]  travis what do you think i'm gonna go with real going real you just want to believe it he wants to  did you hear that story though slipping up if you have two penises you're going to be on high alert that  this is crazy that they're staying in your jock strap maybe you can't help contain those things  and would you ever like and what one popped out one leg and the other popped out the other that's  just silly isn't it and then the guy was like oh no i'm not gay but i might be now i might be now  double dog just milking him like a cow with two dicks hanging out of his shorts what do you think it's to 
[03:09:00]  you uh jury's out on this one really yeah i'm not sure some uh some of it uh seems like all right  that's not feasible and then other stuff seems like yeah you didn't hear that last story i know  the last story could just be him trying to sound like a man he could have two dicks but also be  one of those guys who just lies yeah he could be a two-cock guy that likes to embellish the story  yes yeah lying to dicker like he wants it like he's got two dicks and he knows it's humiliating 
[03:09:30]  so he wants to make his two dicks sound cool yeah how one put out a fire and the other chick  jimmy you damn i'm i'm kind of in the jury's eye first i said fake and then a couple of those stories  i think are bullshitting yeah the thing that makes me go maybe it's not fake is a couple of the photos  where it looks like he wouldn't cover his dick in certain pictures and then release ones that it 
[03:10:00]  was uncovered if he was just covering to hide and it didn't look like something was welded on there  or something it kind of looked real i don't know i thought they would have well maybe the one photo  looked pretty well one photo looked pretty real yeah photoshopping is getting pretty funny that's true  these days sam i am going to say based on that story the last story he's a liar wow but he might  be a two dick liar yeah that's the only thing is if he's a two dick liar or not yeah could he be a two 
[03:10:30]  dick liar because you didn't you didn't really take that into consideration opie um some liars have two  dicks just because you're a liar doesn't mean you don't have two decks right and just because and if you  have two decks but doesn't mean you can't be a liar that's exactly right but the avoiding the restroom  is kind of hack that is like oh what what would i what would i say if i had two dicks well i i would  yeah i would i would have to say i would have to avoid the restroom yeah that's true um i'm alone on 
[03:11:00]  this one huh no you're not oh jimmy do you think he's not you think he's a one dick liar or a two dick liar  can we all agree that he's some kind of a liar i'm leaning towards the dick with his mouth open  no i said leaning not nose dying i am it's quick he's a quick motherfucker i'm gonna say fake  wow new evidence new evidence what do you got um go to the uh i got a tweet oh with uh go to my twitter
