<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting his 20-hour ordeal installing Windows Vista, culminating in the infamous "blue screen of death," leading to a debate about PC versus console gaming, with Anthony strongly favoring PC gaming.  Patrice O'Neill filled in for Jim Norton.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the Boston "Aqua Teen Hunger Force light-bright bomb" scare, with the hosts and Patrice mocking the city's overreaction, contrasting it with the lack of similar responses in other cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia).  A caller from Boston defended the mayor's actions.  The hosts received a similar light-bright device and discussed having a listener send one to the studio.  Audio from a Boston press conference was played. The segment was filled with profanity and sarcastic commentary.  The discussion continued into the absurdity of the situation and questioned who made the initial decision to classify the toys as a threat.  A humorous anecdote about a cheese-powder anthrax scare was shared, followed by a critique of the news media's coverage and audio clips from the perpetrators' sarcastic press conference. Patrice’s pink panther shirt became a recurring joke.  The discussion also covered Groundhog Day and Tyra Banks’ reaction to paparazzi photos showing her weight gain.

The show continued with extensive mockery of Tyra Banks' emotional televised address regarding weight criticism, employing insults like "low self-esteem vampire."  Headlines such as "Tyra Bakes" and "America's Next Top Waddle" were discussed, along with accusations that Banks profited from shifting body image standards after previously promoting unrealistic ideals.  The discussion included crude and sexually suggestive humor focused on Banks’ body.  This transitioned into a debate on a proposed moratorium on the N-word, featuring racial slurs and offensive language from the hosts and a discussion of freedom of speech and the word's historical context.  Numerous phone calls from listeners, many identified (or assumed to be) overweight women, were included, with a running gag of the hosts attempting to identify callers' weight based on their voices.  Further discussion of the Boston "light-bright bomb" occurred, along with a call from someone knowing an individual involved in an unrelated news story.  The segment concluded with a comedically bad audio clip of a deaf karaoke performance and a listener pitching a radio show idea, along with a mention of Patrice's upcoming XM show.


A segment focused on "Stalker Patty," a caller who attempted a live 1960s counterculture-themed radio show, including readings of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl," music from The Who and the Mamas & the Papas (with debate over "San Francisco"), and discussions of "be-ins" and "lovens," interspersed with host improvisation and suggestions.  A running gag culminated in a surprise haircut for Patty, which visibly upset her.  The peace sign's creation and meaning were also discussed.  This was followed by a discussion of Daniel Negreanu's blog post criticizing a previous Opie and Anthony show appearance, including audio clips and Joe Rogan's humorous and explicit response concerning Negreanu’s post-breakup anxieties.  The segment concluded with a humorous YouTube video of a rap battle ending in a physical altercation and further playful banter.


The show continued with speculation about Daniel Negreanu's distancing from the show due to Joe Rogan's description of his then-girlfriend (now wife) as "guerrilla fucked," and the impact on his reputation.  The bulk of this segment focused on a rap battle video devolving into violence, with audio clips played and analysis of the rappers' skills and reactions.  The discussion included the reasons for the punch, caller input suggesting misinterpretation of a boast, slang terms for marijuana, and the debate on carrying weapons to rap battles.  A caller, Paul, mentioned seeing a gun in the video.  A running joke about "Dutchie" cigars and marijuana slang occurred.  The "Line of the Day" segment was skipped due to a lack of noteworthy lines, leading to a meta-discussion on content and selection process, culminating in "Fan Eats Cock" being chosen satirically.  Finally, upcoming show segments like "So Your Pussy's Got Talent" and a planned Brazilian wax for a staff member were promoted, along with another mention of Tyra Banks' weight response.

[00:02:00]  Where's Norton today?  Houston  Houston Improv  Houston  Houston Improv  Yeah  Having fun doing his  His  Yuck, yuck comedy stuff  Hardy, har, har  His Hardy, har, har  He's on the road doing his Hardy, har, har  Hardy, har, har  I like that  Good for him  Good for him then  How are you, Anthony?  I am fine and dandy on this  Friday morning 
[00:02:30]  Nothing beats  Just getting up at an ungodly hour every day  I love it  It sucks when you're healthy  But I've been under the weather all week  I hate the term under the weather  Under the weather  Haven't we all?  Aren't we all under the weather?  Exactly  We're all under the clouds  It would be really tough to be above the clouds  Unless you're flying  Even up there you can be under the weather  What a dopey saying  Why did you even say it?  That's how I've always described being under the weather 
[00:03:00]  Feeling under the weather  Makes it a lot harder to get up at four  It's old terminology  That alarm goes off and you're not feeling quite right?  No  Oh my god  Anyway  You just showed me a video in the office  Oh yeah  I think your video is going to go viral  I really do  Yes  Well I was compelled to take out the old little camcorder yesterday  And little digital camera  And make a little video of my experience with Windows Vista 
[00:03:30]  Everyone's just loving it  This is supposed to be all the rage  It was released this week  People were lining up  All the rage  People were getting it at midnight  Yeah  All excited to load it up on their PCs  Sure  Replace that  Oh that nasty old XP that's been working fine for years  So a lot of people said you know  Don't get it  Especially right now  Because a lot of these software 
[00:04:00]  When new software comes out  You got to wait a little while  Until they get the bugs out of it  I'm like no  I'll load it up and see what happens  Well I would have liked to have even loaded it  It wouldn't load on my computer  Wouldn't even load  This stupid operating system wouldn't even load  So I don't just go  Disk no work  I kind of know about computers  So I really  I track down all of the reasons  Why it didn't work 
[00:04:30]  Because you know  They kind of give you these little codes and reasons  And after a while you can figure out what it is  So you go to the various sites  That produce the equipment  That goes into your computer  And then you see how that can be compatible  With the new Vista  Well to no avail  It's just  They want you to actually make your computer equipment  That was working really really good  Work kind of crappy  So you can use their operating system  It's like yeah 
[00:05:00]  You can use it  It'll work with what you have  But you got to really downgrade what you got  Like I got great video cards  In my computer  Games run amazing  Full screen  Everything set to max  You know  And smooth as silk  Great frame rate  Works  Looks beautiful  And I would have to like downgrade that  To use this operating system  Why would I  Why would I want to do that  So I  I did all the  Searching and everything 
[00:05:30]  And just finally  Had had it  So I  How many hours did you spend  Trying to install this  A total of probably  Within two days  Probably  20 hours  20 hours  Of sitting there  Within two days  Within two days  Within two  20 minutes  Oh this thing is supposed to be  Yeah  It's like oh this could take an hour to load  So make some time for yourself  An hour  Disgusted  An hour would be  Yeah an hour would be like 
[00:06:00]  Come on  Yeah  You'd be there going  Come on  How about you go through 12 hours  In one straight clip  Of trying to fix it  And then  Like right at the end  Of when it's supposed to be loaded  That's what got me too  It wasn't I threw the disc in  And all of a sudden  Something came up and said  Hey you can't use this  It was like everything was fine  All the little things are happening  It's loading  And then right at the end  Right at the end  When I'm supposed to have  This brand new operating system  I got the blue screen of death 
[00:06:30]  That comes up  That blue friggin war games  Defcon 1  With the giant font  With the big font  Because everything is shut off  On your computer  Except blue background  And the ability to write some text  It's a giant font  That just says  You're aft  Yeah  A problem  Critical error  Dumping physical memory  And you see some numbers twist  And then it goes reverting back  To original operating system 
[00:07:00]  So after all that  It goes back to Windows XP  Which I had on there  Which you bought  Or you put on there  It was on when I bought the computer  But it just  It took that long  To go back  To what I had  So  Like I said  I really tried  Everything  So when are the bugs  Going to be  To no event  Who knows  Now I'm reading about  Class action lawsuits  Against the company  Microsoft  And  Because of Vista  Yeah  Class action lawsuits  Yeah because  It's a bunch of people 
[00:07:30]  That just get together  And sue  Because it's not compatible  With all of their stuff  And it's not like  My computer's like  Really new  It's not like  It's some old  I can't load it  On my old  486  From 1990  What's the problem here  You know it's a new computer  New NVIDIA  Quad video cards  I mean this thing is  You know set up for gaming  How much is the upgrade  Like $200 or something  Yeah about that  Vista  Yeah  And over three  For the whole thing  If you don't have 
[00:08:00]  You know  It's just  So I  What's wrong with XP  Because why  Okay  Why would I even try  There's nothing wrong with XP  But you gotta just always  Move on to the next thing  Why  That's just how we are  What is the offering  You know what happens  Here's the reason  I wanted to upgrade  Nothing more than  I have  A little tech talk  But I have  Four gigs of RAM  In my machine  Whatever  Most people  Have like one  These days  Excuse me  Yeah  That's good enough  For a big deal  I am now working 
[00:08:30]  Not good enough for Anthony though  XP only  Acknowledges two  And I have four in there  And I wanted to acknowledge four  Because maybe not for now  But Vista acknowledge nothing  Nothing  It just  It didn't even load  And it's for gaming  I just want it for gaming  Yeah  Laugh  You can laugh  I won't even be upset  Point and laugh  I'm not upset  In the least  Four rams of Remy  Remy and Rams  Look to your right  The video's up on opiananthony.com  O-P-I-E  Yeah  And this is the house right here  Yeah  That's a little view 
[00:09:00]  Of where I do some of my business  And  And there is shredding  The  Yeah  I showed people  How to install Vista  Into not  My computer  Ostracize people more  By shredding  A $300 program  Into my  Fellows  Shredder  No I think a lot of people  Are happy that Anthony did  That's because  This video's popping up  On some sites now  And it's getting downloaded  A lot  At this point  Because everyone is  Pissed  Everyone is pissed  And frustrated  Because this was supposed  To be the big thing 
[00:09:30]  And  Oh that's a cross shredder too  We talked  Oh yeah  We talked about this  The other day  We talked about this  The other day  Don't look at my identity  Will ya  That is a cross shredder  Thinks confetti  No people are  I mean people are  People are pissed  Are pretty much with Anthony  On this one  It's working with some people's computers  Some people say  Hey it's worked fine for me  But I think the people  That it's working for  Have very basic  Like computers  It's just  They use it  Yeah they use it for  You know  Email and stuff 
[00:10:00]  And they're not  It's not like really  High end stuff for gaming  And  And NVIDIA  Which puts out video cards  It's a huge name  For video cards  It's not like  Bob's video cards  You know  They  Microsoft  Doesn't recognize  The drivers  For it  It  And  They have a set of drivers  You can download for it  But then it downgrades  The quality of the video  Why  Get a new operating system  If you have to make  Everything  Less than it was  Before  Why do they 
[00:10:30]  Why do they feel like  They had to go to market already  It sounds like  Because they had already  Put off  And I understand  When this stuff comes out  There's always bugs  And they gotta  Yeah I don't mind a few bugs  Work it out here and there  But it seems like  Like this product  Wasn't really ready  Wasn't  It wasn't  And Microsoft is so like  They  They want everything  To be Microsoft  I don't know if you can  Blame them so much for that  But it really gets inconvenient  Because  A part of  Vista  Is  Everything you download  For your hardware  Has to be 
[00:11:00]  Windows  Microsoft  Approved  Like it's gotta be  An approved  Driver  The drivers are the things  That make your computer  Recognize  The various pieces  Of hardware  Don't they work  With like  Apple too  Like  Apple  You can download  Some Apple stuff  Onto a  XP system  I mean iTunes  Right  Yeah yeah  You can put iTunes  On there  iTunes on my computers  And Apple  At this point  Apple  You can download  A program  Where you can run  Windows  So other than  Like some  Giant corporation 
[00:11:30]  Right  And you  Yeah  Who needs that many  Whatever  Bytes  A lot  Who needs four  You know what it is  Other than people  Who play games  And whatever  Right now  Probably  Not many people  You're right  But it's  Computers  The computer industry  Keeps moving  Games keep moving ahead  Graphics and stuff  And you  The games  That are going  To be coming out  Are going to need  Like DirectX 10  And really high  End video cards 
[00:12:00]  And this just  Is not supporting  Any of that  Right now  So that's why  I bought it  You know  Because I was  I'm anticipating  The future  And upgrading  Accordingly  So what would you say  The casual  Computer user  Windows 98  Just stay with  Your Windows 98  For now  I have XP  But it's like  XP's fine  I don't use it  For anything  You know  I get excited  When like  I think like  Sometimes  Like Explorer  It'll pop up  Oh upgrade available  So it gives me 
[00:12:30]  A new look  I got the new  Google bar  Right  But other than  That  I don't care  I'm not using  I'm on a full  I'm on your level  Man  You're not  No  See  You know  It's talking about  Like you know  Trying to figure out  What's wrong  With the installation  I wind up  Having to replace  When I see Norton  When I see Norton  Antivirus work  Like scan something  Maybe dangerous  I'm like  Oh  Yeah  You just sit there  And hope for the best  What do I do  But he's troubleshooting  It'll go away  It works  Anthony troubleshooting

[00:25:30]  He really is  Let's move on  There's a million people calling  Dude  You should play  Yeah I love that game  I loved it  We did 25 minutes  Can I just say one thing though  And I don't have a  I don't have a  What do they call it?  A name  I don't play online  I'm sorry  You don't?  I just don't  I don't do that  There is nothing more fun  Than going on  Playing like Battlefield 1942  Or one of those  Vietnam  Or one of those games online 
[00:26:00]  Because you know  You're playing against real people  And they get  You know they're getting annoyed  When you just like  Headshot them  And they get  They don't know  You're standing right behind them  And you beat them  With a crowbar  You don't even use a gun  You know how degrading it is  To have this huge weapon out  I was playing like  Half-Life online  Counter-Strike  Things like that  And you could take a crowbar out  And bludgeon the guy  With a crowbar  And he sits there  And says  So-and-so was killed  With a crowbar  By  It's just  It's degrading  And it's so 
[00:26:30]  Fulfilling  To do  We gotta take a break  We're really late  We gotta talk about Tyra  We gotta talk about  The light bright thing  What game is Tyra playing?  You promised  You promised  Somebody $500  If they brought a light bright  Right?  I loaded my pocket up  With cash this morning  Just so I can buy  One of those  Well guess what  From some homeless people  I assume  Yeah  Guess what  People have  Come down from Boston  From Boston  With one of the  The bombs  That shut down Boston  I have two rules 
[00:27:00]  For this  It must be authentic  Here we go  I'm not being an ass  About this  How do you prove it though?  I can tell by looking at it  Okay  It's gotta be authentic  Okay  And it's gotta work  I want it to work  I want it to light up  And uh  It's not too much to ask  For $500  Iraq pull the tape  Pull the tape from yesterday  Cause I wanna make it  Perfectly clear  That I did not offer  These guys $500  Oh Jesus  What do they all want  Money from all of us?  Well cause I think  Jimmy said $500 too  And he's in Houston  Go to Houston 
[00:27:30]  I'm not stepping up  Take your bus to Houston  I'm not stepping up for Jimmy  Yeah  Take your homeless bus  To Houston  And get the other $500  Alright  We'll get into that controversy  Just terrific stuff  Those dumb light brights  Shutting down Boston yesterday  Stupid Boston  And the rest of the country  Is starting to catch on now  And they're looking at Boston  Like what is wrong with you  Yeah even New York  What is wrong with you people  These things were around for a while  We didn't get one call  A lot of eyebrows going up  Like who's in charge up there?  Mayor Menino  Light brights shutting down 
[00:28:00]  A city like that?  Big bag  We had the same thing in Philly  Nothing happened  We had the same thing in New York  Nothing happened  They look nothing like bombs  That's the problem  And now they want Turner  To what?  Reimburse them  And I don't know  Keith did that look  Anything like a bomb?  Well what?  Hold on  We can't start a new subject  Oh Christ on a pony  That's right  We were supposed to break  15 minutes ago  A fan  Should we break?  Keith  You think about your answer  You sit there 
[00:28:30]  And think about it young man  You sit there and think  We'll get the homeless people in  Give them their stupid $500  And then kick them out  We'll talk about the N word as well  That's whatever  Another controversy  Yeah lots to do today  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Hear what everyone else is talking about  ONA Uncut and live  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe  It's the Opie and Anthony show  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:29:00]  We have the light bright bomb in studio  Oh we're all just scared  Oh  That's it  It's sort of like seeing a celebrity  Yeah  We have a celebrity in the studio today  That's one of our best guests we've ever had  It's one of the most popular known guests  You can walk down the street  You know why?  Huh?  Because a lot of the guests we have  We've done the walk over  And walked down the street with them  And no one knows who it is  When we walk later  You hold that up  People will absolutely know what it is 
[00:29:30]  It's been on TV  Thousands of times already  You think everyone knows what happened in Boston by now?  A lot of people do yeah  I got a communique from John Minnelli  He was talking about yesterday's show  He really enjoyed the Boston stuff we did yesterday  Yeah  He goes but you guys really didn't explain why you hate the mayor so much  I think that's kind of  I thought it was obvious  But he's saying that we're talking to a lot of new people  The mayor of Boston got us kicked off Boston radio 
[00:30:00]  For a dumb prank  We acknowledged that it was a stupid thing that we did  But he was obsessed with getting us kicked off the air  He wanted us fined by the FCC  He wanted us arrested  One of the license revoked  Which is his big thing that he does whenever anything happens up there  Let's not forget he wanted us arrested  Over a dumb radio prank  And he's hated us ever since  And quite frankly we hate him as well  We did the homeless shopping spree recently  And he came out and just like screamed bloody murder 
[00:30:30]  How awful it was  And not one other city had a problem with our homeless shopping spree  Yeah  They realized what it was  And it was actually  Believe it or not  Helping the plight of the homeless in the end  That wasn't our purpose when we started the homeless shopping spree  But in the end we raised awareness  Yeah  And showed that these people are people too  Whatever  Whatever  You know what I'm getting at  And who cares if we even were doing something good or not  Right  Our radio show  Just shut up  So we enjoy when the mayor does something stupid 
[00:31:00]  Like he did the last couple of days  Yeah  These devices were all over Boston  They were to what  Promote a cartoon on the Cartoon Network  Yeah  Adult Swim  What was the cartoon again  Aqua  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  Right  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  And these things were put up in nine cities  Nine, ten cities  Ten cities  Ten cities  Philly was one  Here in New York  I believe San Francisco  Boston of course  Not one other city  You see the pattern here is what I'm getting at 
[00:31:30]  Yeah  You see the pattern  Not one other city had a problem with this  With this marketing device  Boston had their bomb squads out  Blowing these things up  Blowing these things up  Shutting down the subways  Or the T  Whatever  Yeah  Shutting down the highways  And like you said  Bomb squads  Actually  You know  Blowing them up  I really think  Boston wants  A terrorist event  I think they're  Like the city itself  You can't really pin it on an individual 
[00:32:00]  And stuff  But like  Like the whole Red Sox-Yankees rivalry  Like we've had a pretty decent terrorist event here  Oh we had a doozy  I'm talking about a Lulu  We had a Lulu  You might have heard about it  And like I think  In some strange odd way  Boston is a little jealous  And wants  Their own like big event  That gets them in the news for terrorism  And this was something  They made a huge deal about 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  All the other cities did nothing  And Mayor Menino  They're all still on the war path about this  They want to prosecute  And there's really no grounds for it  The prosecutors are saying  This thing looks like a bomb  It's not look like a bomb  At all  No  And the New York papers  Are kind of beating up Boston today  Yeah  So is the police department  Yeah  The headline  Beantown's blinded by the light  And in New York  The joke was no bomb  They just knew it was a joke 
[00:33:00]  And we got somebody  That works for  You know  For the  For the authorities  What do you think Keith  Is that a bomb  Would you  In your professional opinion  If you saw that  Would you  Cordon off the area  Call the bomb squad  And  Like what would be the protocol  Would you shut down the subways  I'd probably kick it  Give it a good kick  As a first thing  And then maybe whack it  With the nightstick  A couple times  And break it  And if it didn't blow up on you 
[00:33:30]  You move on  And then I would just  Drop it in the garbage  And call it a day  There you go  Yeah  There's no  There's no  Oh my god  Get the police  Yellow get the F out of here tape  We're looking at this thing  And we're like  How can you confuse  This stupid thing  For a bomb  Yeah  It's so obvious  It's batteries  It's a light bright  It's a light bright  It's a flat  It's a flat piece of metal  With light brights  There's not even room  For an explosive on it  I'm no expert  But that's what I'm thinking  Where would the explosives 
[00:34:00]  Be in this thing  Any good bomb  Needs explosives  We're in a world  Where you can't bring  Toothpaste on a plane  Dude  I understand  Let's  I mean  But they way  Went over  They went way overboard  They didn't  They did for average  For people who have sense  They didn't go overboard  Blowing these things up  Nine other cities  Didn't even notice  Rational  Thinking  Yes  They went overboard  Right  But I  Again  I can't bring  You can't bring water  On a plane  Because it might be  I don't know what 
[00:34:30]  But so if you see  I think that's ridiculous  This device  With four big batteries  And a middle finger  It could be an Arab  Oh my god  You're nuts  It could be an Arab  Look Patrice  Look at this thing  That looks like Saddam Hussein  Look at the eyebrows  Look at how thick the eyebrows  You hold this thing  Get him to make it work  That could be  You hold this thing  And then tell me  That this could be confused  For a bomb  And it's a middle finger  Look at the middle finger  It could be like USA  Hey here to you USA 
[00:35:00]  I bet you  It's improvised  It could be an improvised  Explosive device  If you're retarded  Thank you  If you're retarded  Thank you  Thank you  I can't  If you were living in Gotham City  That would be a massive scare  A Batman weapon  You know what though  That's a Batman  That's the Joker's weapon  Right there  We live in a city  Where people  Will just look in an empty box  That says puppies  You know what I mean  So  I'm a paranoid dude  If I saw this  I wouldn't  I wouldn't touch it  It's just like 
[00:35:30]  It's four batteries  I wouldn't touch it  What is it supposed to be  If I don't know  That this is  I don't even know  If this is  I don't even know  What side Patrice is on  Wait a minute  Where are you  I'm saying to you  You're weaving  You're bobbing here  What are you saying  What I'm saying is this  It doesn't look like  Maybe it's the Boston in me  Oh boy  You see  Oh boy  You are a Boston gentleman  What I'm saying is  Look even the Boston people  Yesterday were calling us  Saying how ridiculous  If I walk  If I walk by this in the street  If you walk by it in the street  It's a 
[00:36:00]  It's a  It's a bunch of lights  With  With four big batteries on it  Would you  If you didn't notice  What is this supposed to be  What is it doing  Oh it's getting ready to light up  It's lighting up  The thing is cheap by the way  You have to wait for the thing to warm up  Let me see  But what is it supposed to be Opie  Just say  I'm saying  If you didn't know  It was supposed to be for the Cartoon Network  What is it  It looks like a neon sign  It looks like a logo  If it's all around  If it's all around the city  If it's all around the city  It's hung up everywhere  Dude 
[00:36:30]  We're not stupid in the year 2007  When you see this type of thing  All over the city  You're thinking  Alright this is some kind of promotional campaign  This is a  Honestly I don't know the Cartoon  So what I would say  I would say this is a logo  For some kind of new product  They're pushing  That would be my first thought  Definitely  Alright  Yeah I would think  I'm not going to argue with that  Maybe guts to a toy  I'm not going to argue that  But I'm saying  Because every once in a while  You see this type of thing  Pop up in your city  Whether it's graffiti  Art  I wouldn't think it's a bomb 
[00:37:00]  I wouldn't think it's a bomb  But I wouldn't touch it  I wouldn't know  What it was supposed to be  But it's not your job  For God's sake  Like if it's your job  To protect the city  You would look at something like this  And go  Oh okay  I know what this is  Immediately  Right  You're not supposed to know Patrice  I get that part  Right  But they went  They went way beyond  They looked at these things  And went into panic mode  And then they pretty much  Called in the SWAT team  They were blowing  This video of them  Blowing these up  All over the streets of Boston 
[00:37:30]  The magic question  Is there anybody out there  Right  Listening  Or Keith  Keith  Is there any way  You can create  Let's stop the hysteria  Is there any way  You can make a bomb  Out of 4D batteries  I have absolutely no idea  Is there anybody  That even knows  I would assume  There's some 12 year old white boy  Out there that reads these  You know  Patrice  Unless you hollowed out batteries  And put explosives in it  And then made it look like  They were supposed to be batteries  What's blowing up in that thing  Seriously  Look at it  The light bright bulbs 
[00:38:00]  Could be filled with poison  D4  Oh yeah  Okay  Mr.  Poison  You're nuts  Hold on a second  Light bright  Light bright  And I'm led  Of colored lights  Light bright  Light bright  That's how dangerous this is  Make a face  To glow at night  That's how dangerous it is  Yeah  As dangerous as that  Light bright song was  And we can't get ours to light up  That thing better light up  It better light up  Or the homeless guy  From Boston  Doesn't get his 500 
[00:38:30]  Better light up  That better light up  He said 10 minutes  When we put the batteries in  It does  Longer than 10 minutes  It lashes three times  And he said it takes 10 minutes  For it to warm up  Longer than 10 minutes  My friend  Alright  Let's say hi to Bill  What's up Bill  Hey what's up  Hello Bill  Hey  Have you guys talked about  The press conference  That those  The two guys  That were arrested  For placing those bombs  In Boston  We were talking about  In the office  I didn't see it  But I heard about it  Kind of read about it  Yeah we got some highlights  They're real smart asses 
[00:39:00]  Yeah  That was pretty funny  I mean those guys  Got some pretty big balls  No why  Because they know  In the end  They're not in trouble  They know no matter  What the stupid mayor says  They're not in trouble  At the worst  They're going to go  After the Cartoon Network  They're going to go  After Turner  They're not going to go  After two like  Spicoli dudes  This is an advertising campaign  And nothing more  It's not something  That was  It doesn't look like a bomb  It's not in the shape  Of a bomb  It wasn't  They weren't placed  To cause hysteria  Like a hoax 
[00:39:30]  That's illegal  But to put things up  To advertise a show  Like that  That looks like a stupid  You know  It looks like guts  From a toy  Yeah  Alright  Hey this is what  The New York papers say  On Newsday actually  In New York  The joke was no bomb  New York to Boston  Get over it  And our Boston listeners  Agreed with us yesterday  By the way  The Big Apple's neighbor  To the north  Was brought to a halt  Wednesday  When some harmless  Blinking signs  Advertising a cartoon  Were mistaken for bombs  In New York 
[00:40:00]  Forget about it  Oh boy  Forget about it  And they spelled it out  Forget about it  Of course  The city's 911 operators  Logged no calls  Not one call  Not one call  This is the 911 system  That gets calls  For everything  Attention Boston  Your mayor is a dope  Attention Boston  Your mayor is a dope  Jesus  We saw it years ago  Dope  If that could be mistaken  As a bomb 
[00:40:30]  Then anything  You might as well  Just close down the streets  For anything  A Pepsi can  Rolling down the sidewalk  Like no calls  When the identical devices  Depicting in lights  A character from  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  Were planted about  Two weeks ago  So these things  Were planted a while ago  Yeah  Oh  Way to be on top of it  To begin with  They let these things  Hang out for about two weeks  And then they finally  Have a problem  Then they have an issue  Dude stupid me  I thought they planted them 
[00:41:00]  Tuesday night  In the middle of the night  And then Wednesday  All hell broke loose  These things were hanging around  For a couple weeks  Yep  The guys who brought it in  Said he's had it for two weeks  Oh my god  They were planted  About two weeks ago  It takes a little more  Than that to shock us  Said Randy Martinez  A bartender from Manhattan  Who heard about  The response of Boston  In fact 38  Of the 40 signs  Hung in New York  Disappeared  Presumably swiped by  Cultish fans of the show  That airs on Cartoon Network  Could it be  That New Yorkers 
[00:41:30]  Weren't concerned  Because they are  Injured  What  Oh  Are inert to marketing  Or are Bostonians  Just a bit jumpier  People in Boston  Are a little more uptight  From New Yorkers  Said Hunter Foster  The Manhattan actor  Blah blah blah  Alright  They're jumpy  And the mayor is an idiot  That's what it is  He really is an idiot  They completely overreacted  Yeah why can't someone  Like Patrice see that  And starting today  You watch  I'm just  I'm playing devil's advocate  Of course you are 
[00:42:00]  You can kiss my ass  All of a sudden  Devil's advocate  I didn't even know  Where you stood on the thing  You're over here  Then you're over there  So what  I'm over here now  Well I'm just trying  To follow you  Over here and over there  I'm just a regular guy  Yeah  I'm just saying  I'm looking at an unknown  Light bright device  Hanging around  I don't know  I'm just trying to follow  What you're trying to say  That's all  I'm not going to think  It's a bomb  But I'm saying  I can understand  How they panicked  Because they make us  They make us  Leave our deodorant  I can't take deodorant  On the plane  So I understand  Why they're tripping out 
[00:42:30]  I just understand it  I don't understand  When it's only one city  Once again  You know what  And you watch  The mayor starting today  Is going to  Is going to be hanging  Way low  Oh yeah  He's going to go into  Hiding for a little while  He knows he got  Embarrassed by this one  I look like an idiot  You certainly  I'm a fool  All right  Those are the  Aqua Teen  Hunger Force  Signs  They're  Uh oh 
[00:43:00]  Wow  The price has really dropped  Yeah  The price  Yesterday  What it was  $3,000  For one of these devices  Now it's down to $89  What's with the $89 one  By Monday  No one's going to give a crap  Check the $85 one  $89 one  I don't think that's real  Oh it's real  I don't think it's real  That doesn't even look like it  That looks like a light bright  I think the guy  Took a picture of a light bright  All right  Let's go to Abdul  From Astoria  At least that lights up  Let's go to Abdul  From Astoria  Yeah what's up

[00:46:30]  From Boston  Oh okay  Sir it's Sonny Farrelly  I know I play poker  Online with the guy  Huge listener of the show  Go ahead Sonny  Alright listen  Awful on the air  But he's a good listener  On the daylight  Let me get my point across  Alright  Good luck  In the daylight  From 20 feet away  Alright  What do these devices  Kind of look like a bomb  No  Maybe if you're three  I swear to you  Have you ever  I think everybody  In their life  At some point  Has busted open a toy  Haven't you  As a kid 
[00:47:00]  You rip open a toy  And there's a printed circuit board  And some stuff on it  That's what it looks like  It looks like a broken toy  More than a bomb  What about to the  80 year old ladies  That need to use  These simple cell phones  That are afraid  Of technology though  Screw the 80 year olds  You know what  You check it out  This world isn't for them  It wasn't like  All the sudden  Come on sister  It wasn't like  All the sudden  They got 20 calls  About bombs  Around the neighborhood  They got one  They looked at it  And instead of assessing  What it was 
[00:47:30]  They panicked  And freaked out  And started blowing  These things up  Sonny  Honestly  It looks like a logo  For some new product  Because I don't know  The cartoon  That's what I would think  You know  When I saw it  They assessed  What the situation  Was after the first one  But by the time  They got to the second one  And third one  They had to keep  Taking these precautions  Because they didn't know  The back story of it  They didn't know  That this was  An advertising campaign  Sonny  It is even more obvious  Now that we have 
[00:48:00]  One of these in the studio  This thing is so innocent  I mean where's the bomb  What part of this thing  Is the bomb  You got the battery  The classic movie  Red wire  Blue wire  And no explosives  And I know that  These things look like  A simple toy  Where's the bundle  Of dynamite on the back  To the normal human being  From 20-25 feet away  On a bridge  That's passing by  In an automobile  Sonny  You know I love Boston  But on this one  You guys are just wrong

[00:52:00]  Father's son day  And everyone's  Having a good time  But your father  Was like  The one that wasn't  Cool  And now you gotta  Kind of rationalize it  To all the other kids  Or wasn't there  Or wasn't there  Sadly enough  You're black  You don't have a father  The father was the  A swear was bubbling  Out my mouth  You know I caught that back  Of course  I really wanted to say something  You caught that back  All the other cities  Had a cool dad  All the other cities  Were cool dad  New York  Philly 
[00:52:30]  These happened all over  And Seattle  They all cool dad  Boston was stupid  Geeky  Dorky dad  And now you feel bad  And are trying to  Talk him up to us  I didn't try to talk him up  Patrice  You know  You're just like the news  I'm saying  If I saw  A light bright  That I shouldn't have seen  I wouldn't go over there  And say  Oh this is  This is an ad campaign  Listen this is a tough one  No one has them  Except for homeless people  Who don't want to live  Why don't regular citizens 
[00:53:00]  Have this light bright  They probably do  They don't  But the homeless  Might have needed them  For one  Because regular people  Listen to me  You can yell and scream  All you want  This is a tough one  This is a tough one  Don't try to  White melodrama  My anger  I know that trick  I'm from Boston  Yeah but you love  Try to go ease  Like negro  Let me tell you something  Listen to me  If it was around  New York City  I know Keith  You see how long  It took Keith to go  What he would do  Because he's trying 
[00:53:30]  To figure out  A little funny thing  To say  If you saw  A light bright device  All over the city  Keith  There has to be protocol  You don't just go  What is this crap  So protocol  To blow him up  Not really  But protocol  Might not be  To just kick  The light bright  It's to say  Why is there a glowing  He was obviously  Making a joke  But the reality  Is this thing  Doesn't look  I swear to you  This thing doesn't look  I know Keith  He's not joking  He would poke it  I'm saying 
[00:54:00]  Due to what's going on now  I'm not saying  I agree with it  I'm saying  The device  I'm not surprised  The device  The device  There's a device  The device  Alright listen  We gotta get to the  Audio of the press conference  Yeah let's do that  You've made your point  It hasn't turned back  I'm amazed  I'm amazed  That you are  Taking the other side  I'm amazed  I'm amazed  You're spinning it  Maybe you gotta  Cover the sensor  And put it back in  How do you understand  Reboot  Look at this thing  Patrice  Look 
[00:54:30]  It's not  It's not our job  To figure out  If that's a bomb  Or not  But I'm thinking  That the people  That should know  Would look at this  And laugh  And go  Oh okay  This is silly  I don't know  They blew him up  Patrice  They were blowing  These things up  You can't bring  Orange juice  On a plane  Opie  Cause of people  Don't you know  Anybody that knows  How to blow people up  With orange juice  No  But you can't  Bring it on a plane  I think it's stupid  But I understand  The stupidity of it  Why not the other cities  Why not the other cities 
[00:55:00]  Going into a panic  Nine other cities  Not one of them  Even reacted  One out of nine  Patrice  One out of nine  Are you saying  Boston is dumber  Than who  Who's up in nine cities  I think  Nine cities  Boston is the  Tenth dumbest city  Patrice  In the nation  I think something's  Going on up there  That's a little  You know something  What do you think it is  It's not their people  They're stupid  The people are in charge  Of this crap  They're stupid  Let me ask you something  Keith  Think something is  You have to go with  You have to go with 
[00:55:30]  Protocol right  It's a common sense call  Even back in the day  When we had the  Anthrax scare  When you got  When you had  Every dope calling  For the police  To come open their mail  Because they thought  It was Anthrax  I would walk in  I'd rip their mail open  I would dump it on the thing  Because it's just  It's retarded  There's things out here  I had a lady call us  One time with the Anthrax thing  Not to get off  On a whole tangent  She freaked out  We went in there  She's like  Holy shit  There's powder  Or holy  Something or other  Holy crap 
[00:56:00]  There's powder  Or holy crap  There's this powder  On the thing  Right  My partner walked over to it  He looked at the table  He licked his finger  He put his finger on it  Picked it up  And put it in his mouth  It was cheese  She brought a pizza box  That she had cheese on  On top of her mail  But I'm talking about  See what I'm talking about  I'm not talking about  You using your call  I'm talking about  If Bloomberg  Or whoever  Is making the call  If the deputy  Is saying  Look  Fellas 
[00:56:30]  There's some things  All around New York City  Lighting up  We think it's light bright  But you ought to  Treat it like a bomb  Are you allowed  As an officer  Who gets an order  Not to treat it like a bomb  If you're told to  If we get called  For a suspicious package  And we show up  There is a certain protocol  Where you're going to  Assess the scene first  You're going to say  Hey  Does it look like it  And then you're going to  Make a call  If I think it's a suspicious package  Then I'm going to call  In the bomb squad  But if I look at that  It's my judgment  To say 
[00:57:00]  Yes or no  The entire  Stades were out  Looking at the light  Bright bombs  And they were told  To treat the light  Bright bombs like that  I'm saying  That's what I'm saying  Who's that guy  That's what I'm saying  That's what I was saying  Who's that guy  I'm not saying  The police  Are goofy  I'm not saying  The people  Wait wait wait  Somebody is goofy  And you had to  Follow the rules  Patrice  I agree with you  As far as that part goes  But who's the guy  That looked at this stupid thing  And decided  This is a major threat  To the city of Boston 
[00:57:30]  This is not a Boston thing  When it comes to that point  It's a public official thing  That's what I'm saying  That's why we're  Blame the mayor  Alright fair enough  Blame the mayor  Because  That's why  Patrice hold on  That's why we went  All the way to the top  And we're calling the mayor dumb  And whoever these people are  Below him  That are making these decisions  But yes  This is where we agree  When the state  He's up there  Whatever  Yes they did the right thing  Because they were told  This is what we have to do  We have decided  I agree with that much  Right 
[00:58:00]  But somebody  Overreacted  But how did it get to that point  Is what I'm asking today  Fair enough  And Boston should ask that  Fair enough  And after one of them  You would think they would stop  Running around the city  Right  Blowing these things up  And say okay  Or at least one of these guys  Go and call the superiors  And say hey dude  This is obviously  Don't worry about it  This is a marketing thing  It's so obvious  We took it apart  There's nothing here  Right  Alright so we agreed  I agree  I don't  I'm not calling all the state  The state he's running around  Doing their job stupid  I'm amazed that it got to that point 
[00:58:30]  That's all  You can see somebody  Detached from life  I'm saying  With the way the world is now  I can see  Why they did that  I can just see it  It's stupid  But I'm going  I'm saying  I can see it just by  Oh jeez  This world is as such  Where there's no more common sense  Years ago  Never would have come to that  Those things around New York  Would have had the same thing happen dude  They are  Just hanging around  They were just hanging around New York  Post 9-11  I've still gone and kicked the bomb  All over 
[00:59:00]  No these things were hanging all over New York  These things were in ten cities  That's what we're trying to tell you  Like every other city didn't overreact  They didn't get one 9-1-1 call  Yeah  Not one  Not one  And they get 9-1-1 calls  They get 9-1-1 calls for anything  Not one  I don't want to say Boston is dumb like that  Oh Boston is stupid  New York, San Francisco  All the major cities  Philly  I don't have the whole list in front of me  Every major city in the country  No one in Philly reported a bomb  No  No one in Philly  You're kidding me  Damn it  Philly  It was just Boston  And not only did they just  They blew these things up 
[00:59:30]  No Philly  This hurts  Philly was hoping they were still playing football  So they could throw it at someone's head  Oh is the groundhog coming out  Oh no  Oh they're showing  Gobbler's knob  Oh is that okay  What do you say Al  Al are we allowed to say Gobbler's knob  Gobbler's knob  As long as they don't say  Knob Gobbler  Okay Al  Hit the done button  What do you say Al  What do you say Al  I'm hoping this year is the year we see the headshot 
[01:00:00]  Yeah someone with a sniper rifle  Alright now we can't play the press conference audio  Oh you gotta wait now  Now we gotta wait  Wow  So do you change your opinion now that you know that this happened in 10 cities  In 10 major cities  Okay it hurts a little  And only Boston decided  So we have  I don't want to blame the people of Boston  We have to find one person to blame  I don't blame the people  I don't blame the stateies doing what they were told to do  But someone  One of the higher officials  Made a stupid  He made a stupid call 
[01:00:30]  He made a stupid call  I'm with you on that one  Jesus we're gonna save 15 minutes  I'm just  And you almost came to blows  You know what  You're like Sean Hannity  You just  I  Why am I like Sean Hannity  You just  You look nice on his show  Did I look good?

[01:02:00]  On the front  It cost more than a suit jacket  That shirt is something you see like  When you're watching the shift change  At a strip club  And the new stripper walks in the front door  That's something she's wearing  With a hat over her eyes  Yeah  As she walks to the back  I really  And you have to stay for another beer  And you didn't want to  But the new stripper's here  And you gotta check her out  Cause they're gonna recognize the stripper  By looking at her in the face  You know what I had that one on  It was two of them  It was an Iron Man  With the same sparkles  Yeah  But that cost $600 
[01:02:30]  That t-shirt  Mine I had on  Mine was like $120  Wow  And I don't even know how to wash it  Cause it has rhinestones on it  You don't  You get it dry clean  It was an Iron Man for $600  If you  It just stays selling them for that  I don't know how you guys  Let me get away with that one  You suck up your pride  And kind of dry clean  Wait I just want to say  I want to say something  Thank God you didn't wear that t-shirt in Boston  You would have been arrested  As a bomb for it  Could have been a bomb  The rhinestones or something

[01:20:00]  To be white today  I'll admit it  You should be embarrassed  To be white every day  No just today  Just today  When are you happy to be white  Huh  What happens when you're proud  To be white  364 days of the year  Yeah  On leap year 366  What is  Happy to be white  On days where the sun rises  What does happen  That makes you go  Man I'm proud to be white  Seriously  Seriously what happens  That makes you go  Man I really  I'm not going to lie to you  I know I have it a lot easier  Because I'm white  No proud  Or like happy 
[01:20:30]  Just like if Barack Obama  Becomes president  Black people are going to just  Be all proud  Just proud  Like white presidents  Are redundant  I'll give you  When do you identify  With whiteness  Let me tell you  A proud moment  In white history  This is one small step  For man  One giant leap  For mankind  That was all  White people  Just white  That was all white people  He didn't say  White kind  He said mankind  The whole rocket  Was painted white  I guess let's wink twice 
[01:21:00]  And say mankind  But you know who we mean  I didn't see any brothers  Strolling around on the moon  There ain't been one brother  Walked on that moon  Not one  There ain't been one brother  That walked on that moon  Jesus Christ  Did you have to say it like  Yes I did  Did you have to say it like Amos  I was all hip hoppy  Where's that black accomplishment  Come on  Go to the moon  Every time you guys accomplish something  For the first time  We have to read about it  We're still hearing about that  God damn George Washington Carver  They gave us ankle braces  We can't even leave  Our own neighborhood  Never mind the moon  Let us fly to the moon  They got a movie coming out 
[01:21:30]  Of the astronaut farmer  Even dumb white people  Can vent a rocket  Flying out of space  That looks ridiculous  Ridiculous  Billy Bob Thornton's just lost his mind  That movie looks ridiculous  He's been in a few bombs lately  He builds a rocket  Would you say that that made you feel proud as a white man?  No that movie looks stupid  No I mean  The moon  Oh the moon thing?  Just like  No that was a  What makes  What do you identify  That was a mankind thing  What do you identify  That white people do  When you go  Man it's good to be white  White people 
[01:22:00]  I'm proud of being white  Just pretty much  The whole  Getting civilization together  Kind of  Kind of really  You know like  Take the United States of America  Wait a minute  Take the US  Wait a minute  When does civilization get into effect  By the way?  Well I mean  The real civilization  Not the friggin  I don't care if  You know  You made ramps with sticks  And pushed rocks up into pyramids  You know  That's all cute and well and fine  And everything  Those black Italians  The Romans 
[01:22:30]  The Chinese people  From 6,000 years ago  Exactly  All that stuff  I mean I'm talking about that  I'm just talking about  You take some white people  You bring them over to a country  Like the United States  It's just full of savage Indians  And then  We wipe them out  And start over  And start fresh  We start from scratch  That's right  We completely rebooted the country  If I could go back to computer speech  You're the Vista of civilization  We are the Vista  No  No because  Vista doesn't work  Oh you're the SV of civilization  We are  So you go over 
[01:23:00]  We came over  And then in 200 short years  If you want to make a Vista reference  This is an easy one  Talking about not working  In 200 short years or so  Whitey  Pretty much like  With the buildings  And black people  And a lot of technology  Could you please give us credit  For the fact that you kidnapped us  And we helped you  I know but you guys did like the  You know  And raised your children  At the same time  You guys did  You did all the kids  The heavy work  You guys did the heavy lifting  But you know  Somebody had to tell you  Where to bring that  From there to there  And all that heavy lifting 
[01:23:30]  Made you guys great athletes  That's true  It paid off in the end  So you said all this  We made us millionaires  That's right  That's right  In hindsight 2020  Thank you very much  You got a lot of time in those fields  To make up rhymes  Thank you for slavery  We helped you out  You got to admit  We helped you out  Let's be honest  You look at the past  There was some pretty awful atrocities  But it kind of all worked out  For everyone  Didn't it  Oh god  We're all happy now  Everyone's happy  It kind of had a positive  So is that what y'all 
[01:24:00]  Doing to Iraq now  Yeah  In like 200 years  That place is going to be great  Just wipe it out  Of those savages  Wipe it out  Start over  Let's get to the groundhog thing  Reboot  Ridiculously long setup  Here it is  Here it is  Jesus  I just say that  Really  Yes  Hear ye  Hear ye  Hear ye  Hear ye  On this groundhog day  February the 2nd  2000  Didn't they retire  Hear ye  Hear ye  That should be the H word  You shouldn't be allowed

[02:09:00]  By using N-word, it's just turning it into it. 
[02:09:30]  If you take a piece of crap and call it a steak, it's not going to taste good.  That's kind of a rose by any other name, by the way, only an O&A version.  Very nice.  It doesn't matter.  No, no N-word.  You can't say N-word.  If you're going to ban the word, you've got to ban the use of N-word.  The entire context of it.  The thought has to go out of your head.  You actually have to remove the image of the word out of your head, which is impossible, I think.  I disagree with it.  All right.  These guys have been sitting around all morning. 
[02:10:00]  I apologize, guys.  They're from Boston.  They brought one of the light bright bombs to us.  Anthony said he would pay $500 for someone that brought one by.  I'm stuck.  Give them the money.  That's all right.  What's your story there?  We found it up on the Longfellow Bridge in Boston.  Yeah?  Do you think it was a bomb?  No.  Not at all.  And what did you do, climb up there and took it down?  Yeah, we thought one of the MIT kids made it because there's all kinds of weird stuff around Boston like that.  Yeah, MIT guys, a bunch of genius electronic guys, yeah, little robots and stuff. 
[02:10:30]  So you saw it, and was it lit up at the time?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you just took it down.  And then what did you think of when you heard that the Boston police and the mayor and everybody was freaking out over these things?  It was crazy.  They were everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  There was about 50 news cameras down by the water there.  They had the Coast Guard.  It sounded like a scene from the departed.  It sounded like a coast guard just in case there was something underwater.  It sounded like a scene from the departed.  Unbelievable.  So what do you guys do? 
[02:11:00]  I'm a commercial sword fisherman.  Really?  Yeah.  Sword fisherman?  I'm a glazer.  Long line?  And you're what?  Long line.  You're a long line guy?  Yep.  Goddamn, that's dangerous work.  Yep.  He's like those guys that go out there and get killed.  Yeah, the perfect storm dude.  You're like perfect storm guys.  Jesus Christ.  Up in...  You ever go out to the Flemish Cap?  Yeah.  Pretty nasty?  Mm-hmm.  Grand Banks.  Up in Gloucester.  Grand Banks.  Yep.  Jesus.  Gloucester and Revere.  It looks like a guy that would do that. 
[02:11:30]  You got that look.  There's only certain people that can do that job.  It looks like an extra from the perfect storm.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely, yeah.  Your hands is all tore up, right?  That's a rough gig, man.  Give him his money.  Enough of the small chit-chat.  I'm giving him...  There you go, Keith.  Hand it over.  Thanks for taking the trip.  Doing a black Phillip tomorrow.  Taking the effort.  Yeah.  Guy's a hardworking guy.  Jesus Christ.  That's one of the worst jobs you could have in life.  Tell my wife.  You guys say hi.  She couldn't make it.  What's her name?  April.  April, what's up?  All right.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:12:00]  Is that a week's worth of pay, or is that like just an hour?  Depends on how much he gets.  No, that's about three days' pay.  Three days' pay?  Three days?  All right, man.  There you go.  All right.  Nice.  There you go.  Go get yourself.  Enjoy New York.  Thanks, guys.  Enjoy the nightlife.  All right, man.  We could easily do another hour, but we got to get out of here.  Yeah.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Patrice O'Neill, thanks.  You're welcome.  You want to promote anything over here?  Yeah, well...  Comedy shows, anything?  What do you got?  Well, I just want to promote Black Phillip tomorrow on XM.  Yeah.  He's doing his own show on XM tomorrow night. 
[02:12:30]  Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  Love advice.  It's amazing.  It's like it's from another planet.  Absolutely.  Always a pleasure, Patrice.  Thank you, sir.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  It's the Ovi and Anthony Show.  The Ovi and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[02:16:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of the effect of Tylenol CM.  Opie.  You know, I could have been a model. 
[02:17:00]  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Marty.  Good news.  We got the light bright bomb working.  By we, we mean Danny.  I complimented him on being a genius and everybody, of course, had to just rip him apart and say, 
[02:17:30]  no, it was just dumb luck.  He's not a genius if it took three hours for him to figure it out.  Here's what happens.  These things, these things that were put all over the country, the big cities for the Cartoon  Channel, Cartoon Network, and caused a panic in Boston.  They have four magnets on the back, and they are meant to be stuck to metal objects.  We couldn't figure out how to turn this fucking thing on.  You take out a battery and put it back in. 
[02:18:00]  It blinks and then turns on for a couple of seconds and then goes out.  What you then have to do is put it on a metal surface.  The magnets are actually wired in to the circuit board, and when that circuit is complete by  the metal that it sits on, the lights come on.  So I was like, wow, Danny, that's really smart.  You figured it out.  And, of course, none other than Sam has to rip him apart and tear him down.  He hung it up, and it just happened to light up.  He didn't figure it out.  He was convinced that it was solar. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, here comes Danny.  And all morning, he's been trying to, he's been putting paper over some of the different  sensor.  He thought there was a sensor that's been picked up, and it would only come on in the dark.  He's been taping things over.  You had a whole nother idea on the walkover saying, I think if I make a connection between  these two little wires here.  Oh, the jumper.  He's talking about jumpers that need to be connected.  He didn't figure anything out.  I think that I'm a genius.  No, you're not.  Well, it was in your possession when it came on, so I consider Danny the one that actually 
[02:19:00]  got it working.  I'm a genius, and I get full credit.  No, you don't.  All right.  Very good.  We were having fun on the way over with it, too.  Danny was holding it, and I was just screaming at people, get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  And you could see so many of the people looking at it, knew exactly what it was, and started  laughing, because it's that ridiculous thing.  You get that on video?  Yeah.  All right.  Of course.  Everything we do is on video.  I know.  Jack from Boston.  What's up, Jack?  Yeah, I actually know Peter, and everybody around us is trying to do a whole free Pete 
[02:19:30]  thing.  I'll send you guys some of the images, but if you guys want to talk to him, when he gets  out, I can set you guys up.  When he gets out of what?  Well, I mean, if you guys want to talk to him, is he even bailed out yet?  He's bailed out?  He's bailed out.  That's what I'm saying.  We called one of the guys.  We called one of them, and I don't know who...  Oh, wow.  Don't you love when that happens?  Yeah, no.  I wanted to get you guys a phone number for him.  I didn't want to go on the air.  All right.  You got a phone number?  How about you call him if you're friends with a guy and go, hey, Opie and Anthony are really 
[02:20:00]  cool.  They've been supporting you.  I'll take care of that right now.  We won't talk about things we know he can't talk about.  All we want to really talk about is 70s hair and the press conference from yesterday,  not involving any of the questions about the case, but just about how reporters are  dolts.  No problem.  I'll have them call out right now.  And which one do you know?  Hello, Peter.  Dreadlocks?  All right.  Dreadlocks, yes.  Here's what you do.  Stay on hold.  We're going to put you on hold, and someone's going to immediately pick you up and give 
[02:20:30]  you the number to give to him to call us, okay?  All right.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you, Jen.  Thank you, Jen.  That's inside.  I know.  I just can't stop doing that.  Anytime there's a John or a Jack or...  All right.  Uh...  Duh.  Bye.  Bye.  Patrice is doodling.  And look, I just fucking came all over myself again.  This fucking club soda addiction I have just stinks. 
[02:21:00]  Now I need...  Thank you, Than.  He'll get me a paper towel.  Hey, Patrice.  Like a clean up.  Patrice.  You were on Monday's show when we were doing Def Karaoke.  Did you hear what they did with the audio?  You haven't heard yet?  Oh, we got to play this, then.  We're still kind of settling in.  By the way, Patrice might have come up with the best elevator gag.  Jimmy's, uh...  Jimmy is the king of the elevator gag, but, uh...  Full elevator.  We're on the fifth floor.  There's at least five or six we're leaving behind to go up higher. 
[02:21:30]  And all of a sudden, just as we're getting to five, Anthony,  Patrice, like, makes his way to the buttons, like,  excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, like, he's got to push a button.  And so this guy goes, because it was obviously just,  you know, inconvenient for everybody.  So the guy's like, what floor?  I'll push it for you.  And Patrice, as the door's open for five, goes, uh, 11.  So the guy goes, click, and pushes 11.  Patrice goes, thank you, and walks out of the elevator. 
[02:22:00]  I pissed him off.  Very, very funny.  He was going higher than 11.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than when someone hits a button below the one you're getting off on.  Let me get this out of the way, because it's coming in a hundred times,  because someone needs attention.  Coffee boy from Arizona.  So, Opie, what happens when Tyra shows up in studio like Whoopi?  The show going to fold and lick her ass, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, you're probably right. 
[02:22:30]  Because if she comes in, and she's nice and funny, and has a sense of humor about the  whole thing, um, we'll just rip into her.  Yeah.  Because that's what we do.  All right.  There you go.  So you can stop typing.  What did they want us to do with Whoopi?  We had goofed on Whoopi, because she had come to New York, uh, and she was doing radio,  and, uh, morning radio, so we just goofed on, because the concept of our show, uh, stunk.  We goofed on how awful it was.  It sounded boring and awful, so we goofed on it, and one day she comes strolling into 
[02:23:00]  our studio during our show and sits down and goes, all right, what do you guys got  to say?  And she was really funny and charming, and, like, what would they have us do?  See, some of these listeners don't understand that the bit is that the fact that me and  you folded, and that's, you know, circumstance.  Right.  There's been many times we haven't folded when we're confronted with something, uh, but  by the way...  We're just people!  But by the way, with the whole Whoopi thing, when we did kind of fold that day, we still  told her how awful her show was, but people forgot that part of it. 
[02:23:30]  She was like, you know, it's not for you.  It's for women.  But the bit certainly was that she had the balls to come in here and confront us.  Of course.  I thought that was, that, that in itself was the bit that day.  Are you going to lean?  Patrice, so deaf karaoke with Queen on Monday, the boys took the raw audio of you and Anthony  going back and forth, and it wasn't in any order, remember that?  Right.  They put it in order and made this, so you might want to put the headphones on.  Check this out.  The National Association of the Deaf and the Opie and Anthony Show are proud to bring you 
[02:24:00]  a heartwarming presentation.  Mama, don't do the man.  Stone Cold Deaf, a hearing impaired tribute to the music of Queen.  Mama, don't do the man.  Mama, don't do the man.  Mama, don't do the man.  Life is over.  Listen and cringe as a room full of genetic defectives attempts to sing a classic Queen 
[02:24:30]  melody and fails miserably.  God just doesn't want some people to sing.  Shut up, cauliflower ears.  This is a dump, this is a dump, this is a dump. 
[02:25:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, it will not.  No, no, no, no.  No, it will not.  Let it go!  Let it go!  Let it go!  Hey, candy dish ears.  Stop interrupting.  And let the other guy sing. 
[02:25:30]  Mama mia, mama mia.  Mama mia, let it go.  Mama mia, let it go.  You're gonna wish your ears were busted too after hearing this.  Mama mia.  Mama mia.  Mama mia.  that's why each cd comes with a free ice bin  call 1-800 
[02:26:00]  huh what that's  1-800-h-u-h-w-h-a-t and order your copy  of Stone Cold Death.  $5 from every purchase  will be donated  to a special fund  which supplies  deaf citizens  with alarm clocks,  books on tape,  concert tickets,  and iPods. 
[02:26:30]  For more information  on this compilation  or how to get involved  in the deaf community,  go to www.godstrippedmeofmyhearingandmywilltoliveisfollowingquickly.com  Oh, man.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's just... 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Isn't that really bad?  Oh, I didn't realize we did the whole fucking song.  Just about, yeah, yeah.  That's just about every...  Like, we did it out of order,  and they just mixed it into the actual song.  Frankensteined it together.  Oh, man.  Oh, just like...  Yeah, good job.  We did it for a long time.  Yeah.  For the long time we did that.  Oh, yeah.  The whole song.  Oh, God damn song.  But we didn't do a lot of the,  uh, mama, I just killed.  No.  We didn't do that,  but we just like...  Nah.  We'll not let me go. 
[02:27:30]  And you see how it changed from deaf to retarded  like many different times.  It's very easy to do that,  fall into the retarded voice.  And then it goes,  let me...  Wait, uh...  What's the one?  I gotta go!  I gotta go!  Like, why would a deaf person do that?  I gotta go!  You could be completely intelligent.  What's the...  What is he up to...  I gotta go.  Oh, my goodness.  It just...  You can see how it slipped in from retarded to deaf.  Ah, next week he'll make it into a retardco records or something.  No, Steve. 
[02:28:00]  Is that on the website?  I think so.  People are asking for that one, so...  All right.  Uh, stalker Patty wants to what?  Pitch a show.  She wants to pitch a show.  Pitch a show.  Yeah.  We are, uh...  Isn't this amazing that the airwaves of this satellite radio station's channel are open  to, uh, just the average Joe on a Saturday.  Razzle Dazzle!  And, uh, Patty actually has an idea.  Is it an organized...  This is her pitch. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, here's her pitch.  So we'll bring her in.  All right.  Uh, you know, we're gonna say no to this, obviously.  Oh, my God.  I just saw the title, and I'm done.  I'm done!  We're gonna say no to this, obviously, but...  This was one time...  I wish that fucking Lightbrite thing was a bomb right now!  Right when she just walked past it.  We are looking for pests to do, uh, radio on this fine channel.  Yeah.  And so far, none of the pests have come up with a good idea.  No.  But they're still trying.  We've had the staff.  Eventually, we will have pest radio.  An hour, maybe two hours a week.  Yep.  Dedicated to you guys. 
[02:29:00]  We've had the staff do good shows.  Patrice, of course, has done a great show.  Uh, but, you know, nobody else has really come to the table.  I must say, at least Patty has an idea.  It's printed out.  She has thought it out a little bit in her little, little pea brain.  And, uh, it is called, Here is My Outline.  And the title is, uh, what is it, Patty?  Oh, stupid.  My generation.  It's called My Generation. 
[02:29:30]  When did you decide to become a redhead?  Yeah, what the fuck happened there?  Oh, my God.  What happened, henna head?  I used the little hair coloring to cover the gray like everybody else's redhead does.  And you can still see where the gray is.  Yeah, you can kind of still see.  Like, she didn't quite ungray the gray.  What happened?  You can still see it.  Like, by where a man would have, like, your sideburns?  I can't help it if I'm my age.  Wait, no, no, no. 
[02:30:00]  I'm saying, like, your sideburn things right here.  Yeah.  You kind of missed that.  You missed that area.  There's a spot on top.  And you missed part of your bangs.  When did you do it?  Uh, about a month ago.  A month ago, so it's growing out?  Yeah, I think so.  You got to do it again?  Well, turn around.  Let's see the whole thing.  Oh, boy.  I don't think it's that bad.  You missed, like, major spots.  Well, thank you.  They look like highlights, the parts she missed.  Really?  We'll call them lowlights because they're on her head.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  I just thought it was a good idea what I wrote. 
[02:30:30]  That's all right.  No, your hair looks fine.  You look great as a redhead, I swear.  Keep your confidence up there, Patty.  Yeah.  Now, you got to sell this.  You got to sell this.  You ever been in a pitch meeting?  No, I don't know what one is.  Very nerve-wracking.  Well, it's when you give a pitch in a meeting, you dolt.  You got to kind of give your idea and make it sound really good.  Okay.  You can't just go, that's stupid.  It's my generation.  People would be like, yeah, it's stupid.  Get the fuck out.  Anthony, really fast.  Reading from Whackbag, Opie, in big letters. 
[02:31:00]  Give Pest Radio to No Filter, Paul, Sonny, and me.  We would love to.  We need an idea.  I think they do have an idea of some sort.  And they actually made up some promo sounders and stuff.  All right.  Then one of those guys call the show with their idea.  Get a fucking idea in here.  I don't know what the idea is.  Who are they giving the idea to?  Do you know what the idea is?  I don't know what the idea is.  All right.  There you go.  What's the idea?  If I don't know, you don't know, then how's it going to get done?  I don't know the idea.  All right.  So, Patty, yeah.  You want to copy this?  I want to be a pirate.  Here.  Here.  All right.  So, I don't remember what I wrote. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Now, pitch the show.  Pitch the show.  Now, remember, this is the best show ever.  This is how you got to go into a pitch meeting.  Well.  Best fucking show ever.  Okay?  And high energy.  And let us know why it's going to be good.  Okay?  Well, I happen to be into the 60s, and I'm very interested in it.  What, age-wise?  I was a child in the 60s.  First of all, wait a minute.  Time, time, Patty.  Patty, wait.  Slow down.  All right.  Hold on.  You shut up.  Put your headphones on so you can hear Patrice when he's talking to you.  Even though he's two feet away from you. 
[02:32:00]  But I guess if you have the headphones on, you can finally hear.  I mean.  All right.  I was going to say, Anthony.  Yes.  And Opie.  And Anthony.  Oh, don't blow up her spot.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Listen.  Yes.  You are giving away too much, like, energy.  Really?  And back and forth and banter with this pitch thing.  You have to be completely void of emotion, and you sit there with your pen twirling in 
[02:32:30]  your mouth.  When you do the pitch.  When she has to be as uncomfortable as possible, they're not going to ask her questions.  You're right.  She has to pitch it.  See, I had to talk her up that much to bring her up to the level of completely boredom.  So you should let her do her awful pitch first, and then...  Do you think anything I say is going to sink in that head?  She's delivering this the same way as if I just said nothing.  I'm trying to get a contrast.  Like, the people will now go, okay, she's going to deliver a nice, energetic... 
[02:33:00]  And then when they see what a bore fest she is, they'll go, ah, it's a contrast, you know?  Look at her brain.  It's rusting.  It's coming out in her hair.  That isn't hair color.  It's brain rust.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Why are you taking the head pose off?  I can't hear anything on them.  Yeah, they're not on.  See, I know.  So I never went to school to learn about doing the radio.  We don't care.  I don't know anything about terminology.  I didn't need it, Patty.  I'm doing this totally wild.  The future is endless for you. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  So what is my generation?  And you're going to host this show.  Talk a party show called My Generation.  Let's go.  Take a taste of My Generation.  All right.  Okay.  Well, this is my outline.  I'm going to call it My Generation because it has a lot to do with the 60s, and that's  a time period that I was a child and I grew up in.  And I'm a big fan of the music of that time and the hippies and everybody, you know, marching  on Washington against the war and people were so involved. 
[02:34:00]  So I want to bring a little of that out.  And one of my writers is Allen Ginsberg.  I have a poem honed by him, which is really good.  I was going to start off with that.  Honed or home?  A poem.  Yeah, but is it honed by him?  One of your writers for the show is Allen Ginsberg.  Allen Ginsberg?  Himself?  Well, no.  I have something written by him.  Oh, I thought maybe.  I was going to open the show with.  Well, there's a lot of radio shows.  I don't know what the budget is.  I don't have writers. 
[02:34:30]  I just thought.  I didn't know what the budget would be if you got to hire Allen Ginsberg.  Is he alive even?  I don't even know.  Yeah, I was going to read an excerpt from his thing, a four-line thing, and then I was  going to open it up with My Generation.  All right.  What, the song?  Yeah.  Oh, the who?  How long is this show?  Only an hour.  That's long enough.  An hour show?  Yeah.  I'm going to spend 15 minutes with that.  Now, 15 minutes.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah.  Where is the Allen Ginsberg poem?  You got it with you?  No, it's home. 
[02:35:00]  It's home.  Can we find it online?  No, it's home.  It's from Howl.  It's the first four lines of Howl.  All right.  We can find that online for you.  Hold on.  I'm sure.  Bill, take three hours to find that.  Now, that 15 minutes is going to be you reading a poem?  Well, reading a poem that's saying something.  You've got to get some poetry for my radio show.  So, she's doing the fucking Clint Eastwood.  The Clint Eastwood.  Play Misty for me.  Play Misty for me, DJ.  Yeah.  I'd like to hang out with you, but I've got to get home and write stuff. 
[02:35:30]  You've got to do it in the Stalker Patty voice, though.  I've got to write stuff for my radio show.  No, no, no.  Stalker Patty as Clint Eastwood.  Let's see how good you really are, Anthony.  I've got to go home and write stuff for my radio show.  Get records together and write some poetry.  That's pretty good, man.  Go ahead.  Make my hair look like an abomination.  You know, I might change the music around a little bit, but then when I get into the 
[02:36:00]  part about the hippies of Haight-Ashbury Street and talk about what they did and stuff, what  the be-ins and lovin's, what they actually mean.  Can you do that off the top of your head?  What were they doing?  What is exciting about you talking about the hippies and Haight-Ashbury and all that?  I think that were non-conventional and breaking away from the norms of the time.  So give us a little, okay, your song you want, do you want this like in the background  as you're doing it?  Yeah, I would like to do that.  A little-  I say we start with the first thing, because we got the poem.  Oh, you got the poem.  And then we'll go into the Haight-Ashbury. 
[02:36:30]  Well, it's got to be printed out, I guess, and given to her.  Well, it turns-  It's what?  It's eight pages.  Eight pages?  Which one-  Is it the first line right there?  How far into it are you going to get?  Right there?  Yeah, right from line one to line four.  All right, so let's make believe this is the Stalker Patty radio app.  Line one to line four.  Can you read it from there, Patty?  Yeah, I can.  All right.  Do you want My Generation first?  It says-  And where's Steve?  He's going to-  Open with song, My Generation, by the who?  We can work this out live on the show. 
[02:37:00]  Get Steve in here, the big voice announcer.  We'll go back to 40s radio.  Yeah, that's what this sounds like.  Jesus Christ.  All right, where's Steve?  He's coming.  I'm having a homosexual relationship.  Do you want Steve to intro you over the My Generation?  I guess so, yeah.  All right, Steve, you got to be the big announcer for Stalker Patty's radio hour.  Is there a copy?  And, of course, it will be Razzle Dazzle.  So use the Razzle- 
[02:37:30]  Look at how he sighs when he's got to do a Razzle Dazzle.  He's like, oh, God, no.  Go Razzle Dazzle time for the Stalker Patty radio hour.  That's your fucking dynamite.  But hold one ear, because we're going old school.  Wait.  No, you got to just hold it.  I don't know what it meant back in the day.  Yeah, no, it's this one.  It's this one.  It's like that?  Okay, so Steve's doing a visual line.  He's almost cupping you so you can hear yourself better.  All right.  Sometimes you got to, like-  All right.  All right, start the music.  What's the line?  Is it the Razzle Dazzle writing hour?  The only reason it did that- 
[02:38:00]  No, no.  Just say Razzle Dazzle.  It's Stalker Patty with something.  Stalker Patty's Radio Hour.  Radio Hour.  Sponsored by Luxe Soap.  I don't know.  Just some old product.  Luxe Soap.  Luxe Soap.  Sponsored by Brill Cream.  War Bonds.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Lucky Strikes Cigarettes.  Lucky Strikes isn't bad.  Ajax. 
[02:38:30]  Forty Mule Team.  Geritol.  Geritol.  All right.  Oh, very funny.  Geritol Hair Dye.  Who came up with that?  Danny.  Another genius move by Danny.  Just amazing.  Sam, you're slipping in the fucking ranks.  Oh, you video camera jockey.  Just fucking take pictures of everyone else's talent.  Dude, we should have a countdown with the staff members.  What kind of countdown?  Kind of like how they count down the top songs of the week.  Oh, who's been the best of that week? 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  Oh, that's an idea.  I want to research the top of that song.  I'm working his way up the charts.  It's Danny.  Right.  This week, actually turning on the bomb animation and coming up with Geritol.  Falling in the charts is Sam.  And his caustic demeanor is kind of getting tired.  And that fucking video camera, I'm really sick of it becoming part of his hand.  Now a long-distance dedication.  Razzle Dazzle.  To E-Rock's family. 
[02:39:30]  To E-Rock's family.  All right.  Ready?  Steve?  All right.  Wait.  We've got to start the music.  We're going to do a run-through here.  All right, Bill.  Hit the music.  My generation by the who.  Cue Steve Razzle Dazzle.  It's Stucker Paddy's Radio Hour.  Sponsored by Geritol.  And now.  And now.  Here's Stucker Paddy.  Hello, hello, hello.  How are ya?  I want to open up with an excerpt from a... 
[02:40:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Okay, this is great.  All right.  This is good.  I like this.  We need more from Steve.  A little more from Steve.  All right.  And Paddy, what you got to do, remember, no one knows what the fuck this show is about.  Right.  So your opening has got to be a little explanation of what your show is going to be about.  Don't run through the whole thing, but just kind of say what the feel of the show is going  to be, who you are, and that it's called My Generation. 
[02:40:30]  You know, get them familiar with the show.  And she has to say hi to our audience in an old school 40s radio way.  And don't wait for an answer.  Hi, how are you doing?  And she's like waiting for everyone to say...  Waiting for the voices in our heads to answer her.  No, like, what was that old one about all the ships at sea?  We need some kind of thing.  Two.  Yeah, what was the fucking opening line to that one?  And all...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  We need something like that.  Maybe someone can help us. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  All right.  Really...  Good night, Mrs. Halabash.  Wherever you are.  And all the ships at sea.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, how ironic is it that Patty's into the free love culture?  Yeah, no kidding.  That's kind of ironic.  Free love.  And she's so cheap, she couldn't even give that away.  Yep.  Fifty-three?  No.  Two?  Not yet.  Fifty-one?  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, we're going to make Starter Patty show a sport, too. 
[02:41:30]  Bring in the dodgeballs.  All right.  What's a sport?  Ooh.  It's just a sport.  It's the first thing.  It's all right.  You need to play defense, too.  What's a sport?  Just close your eyes.  No.  What is it?  All right, don't worry about it.  It's a joke.  Worry so much.  Just do your show.  It was just a joke.  All right, do we have a better intro for Patty?  I think so.  What do you want to call your fans, Patty?  Like, our fans are called pests.  I'm trying to think.  Bored, shitless?  No.  Ant people?  No.  Um, fellow virgins. 
[02:42:00]  Hey there, all we groovy people out there.  You want to call your fans?  The tune-outs?  Groovy.  No, groovy people?  The groovies.  This is great.  All right.  It's like the retarded fucking Brady Bunch.  We need the help of the audience.  Okay, we're going to try this again?  Yeah, let's try this again.  All right.  All right, we're going to open with the song.  Energy, Patty.  Energy.  Steve's intro, and then Patty has to kind of give a little idea of what the show's about 
[02:42:30]  to people that don't know, and then go into your Allen Ginsberg poem, and then you're  going to have to, well, we'll take it from there then.  Take it one piece at a time.  Maybe, yeah, okay, here we go.  If you have a suggestion what Patty's listener should be called, please give us a call or send  us an instant feedback.  All right, all right, we're ready.  Here we go.  And cue music.  Razzle Dazzle.  It's Stalker Patty's Radio Hour. 
[02:43:00]  60 minutes of music nobody cares about except Patty.  And now here's the most pathetic bag lady on two legs, Stalker Patty.  Hey there, groovy cats.  How are you?  I want to read to you an excerpt from How, which influenced me, and it gives me an idea of  the type of people we're going to be talking about.  Okay, this is going to be a show about the 60s.  I grew up in the 60s.  I was a kid in the 60s.  I was very influenced by people. 
[02:43:30]  I looked up the people like the hippies and the newscasts of the Beans and the Lovin's  and everybody practicing, you know, their free form, free speech.  It was an age of coming away from conformity and going into the absurd and different.  So I was only a child then.  And one of my earliest memories was being mad because I was too young to go to Woodstock 
[02:44:00]  and too old to go to the one that came after.  So anyway, I'm going to start with Alan Ginsberg.  Okay?  And the poem is called How.  It influenced people like Bob Dylan.  It influenced people like Timothy Leary.  And this is it.  I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical naked, dragging  themselves through the Negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix. 
[02:44:30]  You know, people were very restless in those times.  They were tired of the perfect 50s and the 40s and stuff.  And they wanted to come away to a different idea.  So we're going to start with...  Well, I don't know.  How did that come out?  I would have to have something in front of me written down, like notes and stuff. 
[02:45:00]  I can't do off the top of my head.  Okay.  So anyway...  I just never did this before.  Okay.  Well, anyway, we're going to go into the song, you know, San Francisco.  Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair, which was an anthem written for the people at 
[02:45:30]  the time that were in Haight-Ashbury, a group of people that got together to form a community  and wanted to be a little different than the rest of the world.  And then it would go into the song, San Francisco.  If you're going to San Francisco, make sure you wear some bad red hair dye in your hair. 
[02:46:00]  If you're going...  What, she's going to play the whole song?  Well, let's hear the song.  Are you going to take calls, though?  Are you going to play the song?  Yeah, I will.  You were going to play the whole song?  All right.  So far, so good.  So now, intro the song again.  We'll play a little bit of the song.  And then you call out the caller.  Say, hey, if you want to talk about the hippie generation, you know, give me a call or whatever,  okay?  And call your people the ant people or the groovy people, whatever the hell you were saying. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  Okay.  We're going to start with San Francisco, which was a song about the people at the time that  I would like to discuss.  Which would be the hippies of Haight-Ashbury Street.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  This is by the Mamas and the Papas or YMCA, the village people?  By Scott McKenzie.  Scott McKenzie.  I thought that was the Mamas and the Papas.  No.  No.  Scott McKenzie wrote that.  Not the village people. 
[02:47:00]  Scott McKenzie recorded it for hours in your hair.  Wait, wait.  Who recorded San Francisco?  Scott McKenzie.  I think the village people.  Oh, yeah.  Bill, look it up.  Was it village people?  Well, be sure to wear some...  Okay, I know.  That song.  Who sang that?  Scott McKenzie.  What?  I thought it was on the Mamas and the Papas.  Yeah, it is the Mamas.  She's crazy.  The Mamas and Papas.  No. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, no.  They sung Monday, Monday.  No, we say it's the Mamas and the Papas,  and then you say it's...  Scott McKenzie wrote,  be sure to wear some clothes in your hair.  Scott McKenzie.  Yeah.  Scott McKenzie.  Right with Scott McKenzie.  Shut up.  Holy shit.  If you're going to Saturday night...  Enough about Scott McKenzie.  Must have hated Scott McKenzie.  If you're going...  You should call your fans the fellow stalkers, by the way. 
[02:48:00]  Ah, there you come.  All right, here we go.  Why don't you intro the song?  That's back when songs were 85 minutes long.  I know.  Intro the song and tell everyone who sings it.  Dirty hippies.  Okay, this is by Scott McKenzie,  who wrote an anthem for the people of the day.  And then it'll go into San Francisco.  All right, well, go ahead.  There it is.  That's it.  No shit.  Do your show.  If you're going to San Francisco... 
[02:48:30]  It says you got some talk here about hippies,  hate Ashbury Street,  social concerns,  marches on Washington,  the war in Vietnam.  Yeah, I know.  I'm coming up to it.  Oh, sorry.  Buffed me.  The hippies of hate Ashbury Street,  a very distinct group of people.  Cut, cut, cut.  Stop the music.  They put the stink in the stink.  The hate Ashbury Street?  Yeah, that was the street in San Francisco.  It was the crossroads of hate. 
[02:49:00]  And Ashbury Street.  There's a hate and there's an Ashbury  and they connected  and that area was called...  Hate Ashbury.  Yeah, well,  the name of the first street  and your show,  they have something in common with me.  All right.  It's a little long to go.  Back to the song.  There's a little reach.  See, I was implying that I Ashbury it.  These were people  who decided to make a difference.  They decided to do something  instead of act on their 
[02:49:30]  former generation's morals and laurels.  They had beings and lovins.  They developed the peace sign.  They were the ones  that put flowers into soldiers' guns  when they were down in Washington  protesting the war.  They were involved.  There was meaning behind what they did.  You know, 
[02:50:00]  they were the people  that were not afraid  to think for themselves.  You know,  they were the people  that wanted to spread  the positive things in life  and to try to create a world  that was different  from the Depression era  that they came,  you know,  their parents came from.  and, you know,  move ahead  with forms of free thinking. 
[02:50:30]  There's a cozy two minutes.  I was going to do  the whole song  and do a song.  Yeah, but aren't you going  to talk about, like, hippies?  Yeah.  Like, you just kind of described,  but you're not really  getting into  being very general.  Well, I have all my notes  home in the book.  I just wrote an outline.  I'll try to remember.  Just try to remember  and just, yeah.  Go ahead.  Okay, first of all, 
[02:51:00]  what is a being  and what is a loving?  They're almost interchangeable.  They were people  that got together  and just,  you know,  they got together  and they just  came across in unity.  They held hands.  They chanted mantras  and their attitude  was one of positivity.  You know,  that was how  they raised their kids.  They weren't prejudiced.  They accepted  each other as one. 
[02:51:30]  And they sort of  came back to,  you know,  the way that,  oh, my God,  that hurt.  Let the record state  I had nothing.  Oh, that's great.  Stan just threw  a dodgeball  right at her head.  She's right in the middle  of her stupid speech  and Stan threw  a dodgeball  at her head. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, that's fantastic.  That could hurt.  Oh, my God.  That was very good.  See, at least  you were getting into  what they were about  and everything.  She was getting  quite passionate,  you know, yeah.  Like about their upbringing  and what they...  Yeah, give us  a little more on that.  Instead of them  just being a bunch  of lazy slobs  who wanted to  fucking take drugs.  with this whole song  of Eve of Destruction.  Oh, now that's  changed the mood  a little.  Not too cliche.  It talks about  the fears for the future.  Fears for the future.  Okay,  Eve of Destruction.  Get that. 
[02:52:30]  And how long  did the peace sign  take to make,  you think?  Yeah, they invented  the peace sign.  Well, they were  the ones that  everybody thinks  it was the hippie,  Robin.  It was me.  I invented...  People used to  point at people  with one finger.  I pointed with two  and then one day  I lifted my hand up  a peace sign.  Me.  He was a little  too young at the time.  Well, how long  did it take to invent it?  Well, not invent it  but they were  the ones that  were the first visible.  How do you know  they were the...  Really? 
[02:53:00]  Maybe they were.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe I can go back  victory sign  being given.  Yeah.  That used to mean  like victory,  didn't it?  Yeah, it did.  Like in World War II.  That used to mean  we beat the gooks.  No, I think that was  pretty much, yeah,  victory, like we just  bombed the fuck  out of somebody.  Right.  Or peace,  you know.  No.  Ironic, isn't it?  I think it was...  Well, I guess that's  probably why they're  going against the norms  so they used it.  Right.  What song you want  to talk over here now?  Well, not talking over.  I wanted to do  Eve of Destruction. 
[02:53:30]  Are you done  with the hippie stuff  and the be-ins  and the lovin's  and the hairy bushes?  The hairy bushes.  Then I was going to go  What about the drugs?  Let's talk about  the drug culture.  Yeah.  Oh, Michael Hollingshead  was the one  that introduced that.  Michael Hollingshead  was the guy  that came over.  What?  I've never heard of it.  Hollingshead.  I've never heard of him.  Hollingshead.  Oh, God.  Could you not talk  on your show?  Is there any way  that could be done?  He introduced  Allen Ginsberg  to LSD  and together... 
[02:54:00]  Well, no.  Allen Ginsberg  was the one  that did that.  Yeah, well,  he was given  his first dose  of LSD  by Michael Hollingshead  who was a guy  at, you know...  I think you're fishing.  You are fishing something.  You are actually fishing  something out of patty.  I'm trying, yeah.  Because she's...  There's something garbled,  some weird garbled knowledge  in there.  It's like it's a weird place.  We're just trying  to shake it loose.  But she knows something.  Like she...  Yeah.  She does have a knowledge 
[02:54:30]  about something  and she's very confident  when you ask about certain things.  Oh, yeah.  And she's really...  Michael Hollingshead.  Yeah, like socially,  she's just inept.  Like socially,  I think it's...  She's kind of autistic,  but it's...  Yeah.  All right.  There's something going on.  Tell us about Michael Collins.  Michael Hollingshead?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, whatever that guy's name.  By the way,  DJ and a light bulb,  Casey Kasem,  and now number one  with a bullet is thin  with a dodgeball  to a retard.  Yeah, that brought him  up the charts.  Very good. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Talk about this Michael Hollings.  Hollingshead.  Pat from Monaki.  Eight.  Wavy, gravy legs.  Yeah, talk about...  Yeah, you got to talk  about Woodstock a little bit,  the drug culture,  and yeah,  that's pretty much it.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go.  No music?  Yeah, we need  Eva Destruction or something.  Oh, no.  She's leading to that.  All right.  Then how about  just throw on any Beatles tune?  Yeah.  Because she likes the Beatles.  Yeah.  What Beatles song  would you like to talk over?  All right.  There's one song 
[02:55:30]  that was definitely  drug-influenced,  and that's  I'm Only Sleeping.  Only one Beatles song  was drug-influenced,  by the way.  Wow, Patty.  Yeah.  There's one song,  the rest of them  clean-cut boys.  I was going to do  15 minutes of the music  at the time  and do musical excerpts  of it, you know?  Yeah.  But I have to research it.  Yeah.  All right.  You know,  and that's not easy.  I don't have equipment.  Yeah, shut up.  Music.  Just any Beatles song.  Is it hard to find Beatles, Bill?  All right, go ahead, Patty.  Continue your dialogue 
[02:56:00]  with yourself.  I've got a feeling  I'm feeling deep inside.  Oh, yeah.  Hit her or something.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I like the Pearl Jam version  myself.  Yeah, I know.  Can't you pick, like,  Eleanor Rigby or something?  She's beating.  Well, it has to be.  That song was about drugs, too.  It was trying to sound like,  this is like, what is it?  Like, you picked  the worst Beatles song.  I'm Only Sleeping  is the name of the song.  When I wake up early  in the morning  with my head. 
[02:56:30]  Play a yellow song.  Right, right, right.  Let her sing  her stupid Beatles song.  Go ahead, Patty.  No, it's when I wake up  early in the morning.  Still in bed.  I'm still sleeping  when I'm in the middle  of a dream.  Stay in bed.  See how she's losing  her confidence  with something like this?  But when she's talking  about Ellen Ginsberg,  it's like she's with that,  you know?  She's really...  Michael Hollings said...  Well, I just need to...  Well, I have to work  with a script.  I'm the type of person  that needs to  because I get nervous 
[02:57:00]  from Madonna.  Okay, here we go.  In the time  when I was born  Here you go.  All right, go ahead, Patty.  Patty, go.  Okay.  One of the most influential  groups of the 60s  was the Beatles,  my favorite band  for many years.  Yeah.  And they came  on the scene  in 64,  their first appearance  on the Ed Sullivan show.  They were on there  two weeks in a row  and they took America  by storm. 
[02:57:30]  The airport was full  of Beatles fans,  people fainting  and my biggest memory  at the time  was watching the...  Everybody!  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  Yellow submarine.  Yellow submarine.  Patty,  that's you.  Go, continue your thoughts. 
[02:58:00]  Your memory  or whatever.  First memory, go.  Yeah, memory.  Beatles, go.  Seeing a lot  of the girls  fainting  in the crowds.  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  Everybody!  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  Patty?  All right, Patty, 
[02:58:30]  go ahead.  Continue.  Come on, hurry.  I remember  when they were  on the Ed Sullivan  show and I was  in front of my TV set  and I was watching them  and that's when  I grew in love  with my favorite fans.  I collected  everything I could  on them.  I still have  a 35-year-old  Beatle collection  still home  and intact.  I collected  all the stamps.  I had to get  the bubble gum cards  but they also  had messages  in their songs.  You know,  like peace, 
[02:59:00]  love,  you know,  going against  the...  And this message.  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  We all live  in a yellow submarine.  I am so glad  I brought so much joy and brevity into your lives. 
[02:59:30]  We all live in a yellow submarine.  I'm so glad I brought so much joy and brevity.  Ah, brevity.  You brought no brevity whatsoever.  I don't even know what it is.  And I know you didn't bring it.  You didn't bring a drop of brevity.  I don't know it.  You're brevity-less.  Was that your Beatles break?  Well, yeah, and I was going to do some, like, a couple of song selections.  So let's sit back and let the people listen to them.  This is a music show. 
[03:00:00]  That's what I was going to talk to me.  It's hardly a music show.  You're like Carol Miller.  What the fuck are you doing?  Well, but I'm not getting the lead out.  She's a dis-dactual feeling.  Even though I like Led Zeppelin, too.  I got an idea.  Let's give her a Beatles haircut, everybody.  All right, Beatles cut.  What do you want?  The Paul, the George, the Ringo, the John?  Come on.  Somebody get me the scissors.  Time for a Beatles haircut.  Why shouldn't you have a Beatles haircut?  The Beatles haircut.  You love the Beatles.  What?  Oh, come on.  Don't do this to me. 
[03:00:30]  That's not right.  What?  What?  What happened?  I don't want a haircut.  What?  We're all singing Yellow Summer in time for a Beatles haircut.  I don't want a haircut, okay?  What happened?  You don't do that to me.  No.  We were just having fun.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  No, you do not do that.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  You're seeing me with a haircut.  What happened?  But you love the Beatles.  What happened?  I don't want the Beatles haircut.  Well, ask her what 60s haircut she wants.  Yeah.  What 60s haircut?  What do you want?  I don't want a...  Make a choice, Maddie.  Make a choice.  No. 
[03:01:00]  If not the Beatles, who do you want?  I want my hair long.  Who do you fuck?  You want Ann Margaret?  Ann Margaret.  That's it.  Red, long hair.  She's got the red hair, right?  You got the Ann Margaret.  More Ann Margaret.  All right.  Beatles haircut, everybody.  Beatles.  Oh.  Ringo.  Here we go.  Turn up Yellow Submarine again.  Here we go.  No.  Yeah.  Time for the Beatles haircut.  Tell me.  Tell me.  Stop it.  That's the Beatles. 
[03:01:30]  Get away from me.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Cut it.  Stop it.  Stop it, okay?  I didn't come here for that.  Okay?  No.  When do we sing Yellow Submarine again?  No.  Huh?  We're going to sing Yellow Submarine as we cut our Beatle haircut.  No.  So right when the chorus comes around, turn that on, Danny, and we'll let it rip.  No.  Everybody.  No.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  Here goes her hair. 
[03:02:00]  Yellow submarine.  Yellow submarine.  Oh, she's fighting.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  A yellow submarine.  Oh, Patty's fighting back.  Oh.  I've never seen this in her.  She's so impassioned.  She's got a ball kick coming for you.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Sit your ass down.  All right.  Well, give me a pass.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  I'm not going to cut your hair.  Take it.  I like how she's holding, like, her hair.  I am.  Well, we couldn't get to it. 
[03:02:30]  Don't worry about it.  Oh, don't be scared.  You're silly.  Don't worry so much.  What justifies you being scared?  I mean, come on.  All right.  So, you do a little Beatles, and then you have a conclusion and wrap-up.  Yeah.  It just means 15 minutes of feedback from the listeners.  Maybe people that had parents that were into this sort of thing, or people that are my age.  All right.  So, we'll do the phones now.  All right.  Do you want any background music?  Yeah.  You need music for the phones.  What do you think?  Oh, okay.  I don't have any. 
[03:03:00]  How about the theme to Mission Impossible?  Hey.  Oh, stop it.  No.  I don't like that song.  How about some kind of, like, 70s instrumental?  70s, 60s.  Let's talk about the 60s.  How about...  Jesus Christ Superstar, too.  No.  How about an instrumental?  What instrumental?  Classical gas.  Classical gas.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  Now, we'll do the phone portion of the show. 
[03:03:30]  Phones with classical gas playing.  All right.  Well, I see a great show here.  Oh, yeah.  This has potential.  It could...  This has potential.  You know, if I could have a chance to get a script together to help me out so that I  could talk.  Somebody stop her with this fucking script.  Yeah, none of us use a script.  Who uses a script?  Who you fuck you, Edward R. Morrow?  Talk good enough.  Let me explain something to you people on the United States...  Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.  Flash!  Flash!  Who sings classical gas, right? 
[03:04:00]  You got it, Bill?  Mason Williams.  You got it?  Yeah.  All right.  Start up the music, and we go to the phones for Stalker Patty's Radio Hour.  Travis from Virginia.  I just threw my XM receiver out the window.  The only reason I'm listening to you guys is I'm on my phone.  This is awful.  All right.  The reviews are coming in.  I like when this song kind of kicks in, though.  Yeah, let's go to...  This is actually a good song.  Let's go to Paul is Dead.  Ruby.  From South Dakota.  Paul. 
[03:04:30]  Good good's hard work.  I've got the perfect ending to Patty's show.  Yeah.  A recreation of Altamont with the Hells Angels stabbing her.  All right.  That was a good idea, Patty.  Maybe you can recreate Altamont Speedway and have Hells Angels stab you.  Thank you.  Paul is Dead.  Let's go to Keith the Trucker.  Keith?  Yeah, I think to make Patty's show interesting, every song she introduces should be done in  Def Karaoke.  Def Karaoke.  All right.  All right. 
[03:05:00]  Let's go to Shaft in Manchester.  Shaft.  Yes, sir.  What about something from Kent State for the Massachusetts College students?  Kent State?  Wasn't that 1970?  Was it 70?  It's right around 70, right?  I think it's not in the 60s.  All right.  Because I would love to have National Guardsmen come in and shoot Patty at the end of our show,  but I don't think the decade's right.  No, I'll be putting flowers in their guns. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  That'll stop the bullets.  Yeah, I just missed.  What about, are you going to talk anything about the moon landing, which was 1969?  That's the 60s.  Yeah, I was going to do like a little list of current events that happened that I have  in the book at home.  Current events from the past.  Called, I was going to use the book, I Want to Take You Higher, that I got as a birthday  present.  I Want to Take You Higher?  Yeah, that was my birthday present one year.  I want to take you higher, too, and then throw you off the edge of the building.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in New York.  Rob?  Yeah, what's up? 
[03:06:00]  Hey.  I got a great show idea.  Okay.  It's called My Generation.  The 60s, I start off my show playing My Generation by The Who, and I'd read the first four lines  of a poem called Howl by Allen Ginsberg.  I like it.  Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.  Frank, punch it out.  Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.  Well, the reviews are coming in.  Dr. X from Mexico.  Yes, Dr. X.  You know, Patty, I wish you were a child from the 60s. 
[03:06:30]  You know, the one that got napalmed in that fucking picture?  The little Asian girl running down the street after her village had been napalmed.  All right.  The reviews are mixed right now.  Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff?  Yeah.  Hey.  I got an idea for the end of her show, just a single gunshot to her head.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to Bill in Boston.  Bill?  Hey, Bill.  Bill?  This could be a comment.  Yeah, it's...  Speaking of volumes with silence. 
[03:07:00]  All right, well...  Silent majority.  All right.  Very big back then, wasn't it?  People are calling with their reviews, but now let's end the show.  You got anything about Dick?  Nixon, I'm talking about, you dummy.  Okay.  Are you a fan of Dick?  Nixon?  Can we soak you with a fire hose?  No.  Well, I was going to do, like, I hope you appreciated this.  What about the Eve of Destruction angle?  Yeah.  Talking about, you know, it's all about free love and everyone getting along, but... 
[03:07:30]  Oh, I know.  You don't have much hope for the future because you're going to play Eve of Destruction.  Hope for the future.  Eve of Destruction.  Well, that's just to emphasize the concerns that some people had at the time.  What were your concerns?  Yeah.  You know, the bomb.  What bomb?  The bomb.  The show you're pitching?  You know.  You know.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Talk over the song.  Talking about the war that was...  Oh, there you go. 
[03:08:00]  I just decided to take up Smoking Pot again listening to Patty's show.  Not because it's topical in the 60s.  I just need to be on some kind of fucking drugs to listen to this babbling idiot.  All right.  You got to wrap up the hour.  Eve of Destruction.  But maybe give the listeners a little hope.  There's a little hope at the end of this show.  Yeah, let's hope that we...  It's the eve of Destruction of the Virus Channel.  Let's hope that...  If this show goes out.  My hope is that maybe we could come back to a simplicity that these people had at the  time rather than the complexities that weren't... 
[03:08:30]  Why don't we just take it right back to Caveman?  That's the simple...  So you like the simpler time...  A simpler attitude.  Yeah.  Of like, you know, German shepherds and fire hoses on black people.  No, no, no.  Women having no rights whatsoever.  Students getting shot.  Students getting shot.  A fucking unwinnable war.  Yeah.  That was a quagmire.  Oh, we got one of those.  I admit I need to do a little more research.  All right.  But give the people some hope.  It's your show.  Yeah, give us some hope. 
[03:09:00]  Let's go.  Well, I want to end this with, you know, a little hope for love and peace in our future.  That we can have a peaceful conclusion in our world.  A peaceful conclusion?  If it's concluding, how peaceful could it be?  And I'm going to end...  The final solution.  I like the way you're thinking now.  And I'm going to end with summertime blues.  Oh, whose version?  Not by the Hope. 
[03:09:30]  There was another band at the time that did a heavy metal version.  And I can't remember the name of the van.  Black Sabbath?  No, it was like...  Like the way the guitar sounded.  Let's just isolate that.  Her voice becomes...  What?  It becomes piercing.  I was just trying to really act like I was hearing it on the radio.  Yeah.  And it's just a piercing rhythm.  It's just a bad rhythm.  It's just after...  You can only take...  So much.  And I'm not even trying to be fucked up. 
[03:10:00]  I just...  I was trying to listen to it as if it was a show because I heard her getting into her passion  and her little thing.  But...  It's just that...  It's just uncomfortable.  Yeah, your voice itself, the tone of it, is awful to listen to.  Your cadence is horrific.  Cadence is a great fucking word.  Cadence is...  You just have this...  It's like driving down the highway, hitting the brakes every two seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  While you're driving over those speed bumpy things...  That's because I'm not good with impromptu. 
[03:10:30]  I have to...  No, no.  This...  You could be reciting the best radio ever.  But with that voice and the delivery of it, it just goes right through you.  It's like people could take their XM radios, put it in the basement, and it would chase  the mice away.  You know what it's like?  It's the Chinese water drip torch.  Yeah.  Like, I just was listening for a while, and I could get past...  And then after a while, it just starts to...  You know, the back of your spine does something.  Yeah, you twist your head.  And you go, fuck.  And once it catches you, you can't stop... 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  It can't stop fucking with you.  Once you think about it.  Yeah, once I think about her voice once, it's just...  It's just...  I don't even want to be mean, because I'm acting like it's a radio show.  I'm listening, and it's just, what the fuck?  Seeing if there's anything there.  And, like, that voice, you can't get past it.  All right, the song is by Blue Cheer, right, Patty?  Yeah, that's the song.  Thank you, Molly Fine, from New York City.  All right, so wrap up your show with a little hope here.  And that show's going to end with that.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Summertime Blues. 
[03:11:30]  Stalker Patty ending her show.  Go.  I want to thank you for listening.  Oh!  Oh, she was done.  Of course, I'm not going to have medicine.  That's like the nom.  You never knew when it was going to hit you, man.  Out in the fucking bush.  You're out there, man.  You were in the shit right there.  You just got hit with a fucking short round.  You never knew when it was going to hit you, man.  You never knew.  Fan, fan, check your fire. 
[03:12:00]  Check your fire.  Gook's in the wire.  All right, and that's it, Patty?  Yeah, well, that's it, but it could be the fellow said, all right?  It's his son.  Well, you need to, like you said, a script.  All right.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  Get the scissors.  The yellow submarine.  The yellow submarine.  Oh, she's...  Get away.  Oh, this doesn't look peaceful.  The yellow submarine.  Just remember to put some scissors in your hair. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, wow.  She's trying to give you a purple nurple.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  Patty, just right above your scrunchie.  How about that?  Wow.  You'll still have a nice little bob.  Like a tiger.  A tigress.  Yeah, she's swatting at you.  Everybody.  It's not very peaceful.  In our yellow submarine.  Come on.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  A yellow submarine.  A yellow submarine. 
[03:13:00]  Panicking.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  A yellow submarine.  A yellow submarine.  We all live in the...  Well, oh, Jesus.  She's kicking to the balls.  Get away from me.  What happened to the peaceful Patty from the show you were doing?  Oh, my God.  She's got the scissors in her hand.  When we could all live in...  Oh, she's going to thrust them into Danny's chest.  You're hiding the other thing behind there, too.  His cut?  What thing?  Don't be so stupid.  Come on. 
[03:13:30]  Get away from me.  I don't need this.  What thing?  Just go with the Beatles hairdo.  Give me that.  No.  I don't want it.  You like the Beatles, though.  Get away from me.  I don't care.  I like long hair, too.  Yeah.  Groovy.  How about the...  Get away from me.  Just give her a cut.  I thought we'd give her a...  No, I don't want it.  All right.  Just whiny.  No, no.  Listen to me.  Just whiny.  How about we give her the Charlie Manson?  I have a McKenzie girl.  What's the...  What's the McKenzie girl from One Day at a Time, her mama?  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Not a father.  The McKenzie girl.  The cute one from Mamas and the Papas.  All right.  No?  No.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  No.  Did you get a little bit?  No, I missed.  No, I don't want you to get any of it.  All right.  We got a hostage situation here.  Hostage.  Come on.  Every time I come, you do this to me.  Stop.  Yeah.  Watch out for that bomb behind you, Danny.  Come on.  All right.  Let her.  All right.  Let her loose.  All right.  Let her.  Free her.  Her voice should only come with hostage situations where she's just stuck. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  Just open the door and let her out.  Get the hostage letter.  America.  America's awful.  We have to get out of Vietnam.  We're illegally here and we shouldn't do this.  All right.  There it goes to POW.  All right.  There you go.  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Who did that?  Who did?  Harry. 
[03:15:00]  How much of it?  How much?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  You guys aren't right.  These guys are cruel.  Oh, fuck, man.  Is she crying?  I don't even want to look at her.  Patty.  Patty.  Wow, what a shot.  It's kind of hard to get.  She's going to chop a finger off.  She's holding her ponytail.  I don't know if E-Rod goes up the charts or down the charts for that one.  Patty, what happened?  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Let's get on my mic.  What happened?  What happened?  No, I am not going to be getting a haircut any time soon. 
[03:15:30]  That was so sneaky.  That was sneaky.  He sure is sneaky.  That was very sneaky.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that wasn't...  And I was holding my hair the whole time.  I don't know how you did that.  It's only...  Wow, that's a big chunk.  That was a chunk.  Now, I am a nervous wreck.  All right.  I'm going to have a cup of coffee to calm down.  Yeah, that'll calm the nerves.  Coffee.  All right.  Good.  Jesus. 
[03:16:00]  Might as well snort crank.  Why was the White House conference room evacuated?  Oh, they had a light bright.  Was it a light bright?  Yeah.  They found a light bright hanging up behind it.  All right.  President's...  Wow, that's a big chunk of hair.  ...evacuated from White House conference center.  Yeah, I know.  Wow, he just kind of nipped that...  I'm going to make a nice walrus mustache.  Well, that was...  So, what do you think?  Now that she's out of the room, we now have to start this out and meet. 
[03:16:30]  Would we air Patty's show on our channel?  Yeah.  Because the bottom line is, it's our decision.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I give it a go.  One hour, no problem.  Some music, her talking.  Yeah.  If she scripts it.  I got to script it.  Pencil her in for a razzle-dazzle.  Razzle-dazzle.  We'll give her a razzle-dazzle.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Shame.  Shame.  That's not the one.  No, that would actually work.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass. 
[03:17:00]  With that, we'll see you guys in a bit.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous.  Goddamn ridiculous.  I need to be a shock doc.  Always up to no good.  Be a man.  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is like the number one show in the world.  It's amazing. 
[03:17:30]  He knows that shit.  Oh, did you see the YouTube thing of the guy that was doing a rap battle and he punched  him in the face?  What?  Go to YouTube.  Wait, get on mic, will ya?  Yeah, it's just great. 
[03:18:00]  YouTube, I forgot.  I was old school rapping.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  Just write that.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  Styling on you.  And he goes, oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  And then the dude kept hitting his hand away.  And he just goes, oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  He's like, I'm going to get the 40 cal and something, something.  And then the motherfucker said, I'll do something.  And the other motherfucker punches him in his face.  Oh, that's great.  What is it called?  Did it come up?  I love it.  God damn. 
[03:18:30]  It's probably the same one.  You're ready because I'm styling on you.  Yeah, turn around and let me see that motherfucker.  Oh, it's like 10 minutes long, though.  Oh, is it?  No, no.  The whole story of the infamous fight is 10 minutes long.  YouTube is the biggest pain in the cock to fucking search anything for.  There's so much shit on it.  We got it, but.  Redundant names.  We want the short version.  Yeah, the short.  The one he's just like, oh, you mad because of style.  All right, here it is.  Show it at.  Yeah, let me see.  Turn it at.  Not your typical rap battle, it says.  Right.  There you go.  I wish it had sound, but it doesn't. 
[03:19:00]  But I just want to see him get punched.  Oh, these motherfuckers look like they're going to start swinging anyway.  Oh, he's chewing his ass up, too, this kid.  This guy is fucking, like, yeah, getting in his face.  And rapping.  The other guy's just sitting there looking at him.  Wow.  Oh, snap.  Oh, now the slow-mo.  Slow-mo punch.  That guy took all kinds of rap shit and then just ends the argument.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  He gave him three shots. 
[03:19:30]  That's three shots?  As fast as that.  He went boom, boom, boom.  Are you kidding?  Let me see.  Oh, man, because of style and norm.  Dude, he hit the guy three times.  Wow.  That is something.  I want to see the three times.  Look at this shit.  He goes boom, boom, boom?  He goes boom, boom, boom.  All right, here we go.  Guy's standing there just rapping in his face.  And the other guy just had it.  Oh, yeah.  He got, he went for the third.  And he is da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Oh, he knocked his-  You got knocked the fuck out.  Try to find the audio of that.  Oh, it's just, and he's just in his face. 
[03:20:00]  And the other guy keeps hitting him.  Like, but this dude is just, you can just tell.  The other guy didn't even see rap.  I just saw this part, the little short version.  Yeah.  I guess it's a long version of the battle.  But the one guy was so good at this battle rap.  And he was up on the other dude pointing.  And the other dude was snapped.  Remember back in school when the motherfucker would be like,  don't put your finger in my face.  When you was making him so mad.  And he'd point and go, don't put your finger in my face.  Just to make something.  There's a rule.  So he was like putting his finger on him.  And he would hit his hand down and smack his hand away. 
[03:20:30]  And he'd go, yo, oh, you mad because I'm styling on it.  Holy shit.  And then he just, wow.  He got fucking fucked up.  What do you got?  Joe Rogan stuff.  Is it good?  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand.  I'm sure it's very, yeah.  Take one, pass it down.  Opie didn't pay attention to the take one, pass it down rule.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's really.  That's instated in like the first grade.  Atlantic City.  Da, da, da.  Because that conversation is against you.  I was going to give you a world poker switch. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  This is from Joe Rogan's blog.  If he's around, give us a call, will you, Joe?  So I've been getting a ton of emails recently about this poker player named Daniel Negronu or whatever.  Negronu.  Negronu talking shit about me on his blog.  Now, what this was all about was we were both on the Opie and Anthony radio show when it was broadcasting from a poker tournament that Anthony was playing in.  This is a legendary Opie and Anthony story.  I barely remember the conversation because it was over two years ago.  But what I do remember was that the guy was very friendly on the show.  But then afterwards, he talked some shit about it online saying it was unorganized and a low-rent version of the Howard Stern show. 
[03:21:30]  So I check out his blog to see what this guy said about me.  And I was really puzzled.  Here's the audio file of the conversation.  This is all on JoeRogan.net, by the way.  Joe Rogan's got audio evidence.  And just in case he decides to take it down or change it, here's the actual words from the blog.  Do we want to read this part again?  Eh.  No.  People know, right?  He just said it was something like, yeah, Joe was being outrageous, unfunny, he said, and saying inappropriate things about his ex-girlfriend. 
[03:22:00]  And we were unorganized, blah, blah, blah.  So Joe Rogan's response.  Now, here's where it got so confusing to me.  If you listen to that audio file, you know what he describes was nothing like the conversation we had.  But when I left that conversation, what I got out of it was here was that I had met this interesting character that makes a living in a very daring way.  And I respect that very much.  He decided to live his life playing cards professionally, and he's been doing it since he was 18 years old. 
[03:22:30]  I told him I thought about how cool that was.  And then I asked him if there were professional poker groupies.  Then he told us that he was recently split up with his ex.  And I asked if he was scared of her getting with other guys.  I said, that's what I'm always afraid of, is breaking up with a girl and her getting gorilla fucked by some new dude.  Daniel laughed hard.  He did laugh.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Then he said he wasn't concerned.  And I said, that's what I always think of.  And then I went in depth about how I always picture some dude fucking the shit out of her. 
[03:23:00]  He suggested that I read a book that addresses that.  And I said, it's just natural chimpanzee instincts.  He still said he doesn't think about it.  And then I described the graphic scenario and asked him if it would bother him.  And he still said no.  And then I said, it bothers me.  And I don't even know you.  Opie then added in.  And one more thing.  The guy was black.  See, Opie was the one that added it in.  I didn't even realize that.  I thought Rogan was the guy.  We were so out of control that day. 
[03:23:30]  Jesus.  So out of control.  Yeah, and I'm sitting at a poker table somewhere while all this is going on.  All hell's breaking those.  I missed all this.  We then thanked him for coming on the show.  And I congratulated him for having the balls to pursue such a cool job.  He said thanks and that he really appreciated it.  And then he shook my hand.  Never once seemed upset with me.  Now I have no idea what the fuck went on in his head between the time he left the show and how he ran the conversation back in his mind.  But I think he should listen to the audio of the conversation and then go straight to a therapist. 
[03:24:00]  If he's distorting events of the past like this on a regular basis, I've got to think that there's something seriously wrong with this wiring in his brain.  Daniel, I know you're reading this.  So I want you to know I'm not mad at you.  Not even a little.  I think we've all had moments in our life where our ego twisted reality into a distorted perception of the truth.  I'm sure that you were hypersensitive to what I said because you had just recently broken up with your ex.  And although you were trying to say that the scenarios I was describing weren't bothering you, they were a lot. 
[03:24:30]  And that's totally understandable.  I think you obviously twisted the events in your mind into some attack on you and it absolutely wasn't.  And I think if you listen to the audio, you'll see that I was being very complimentary of you and that I really respected what you do for a living.  I still do.  I didn't want to piss you off when I said those things.  I was just being honest with the way I think.  It wasn't my intention to upset you and I really didn't want it to happen.  I talk openly and honestly to my friends.  And if I'm having a cool conversation with someone like we were having with you, I talk to them the way that I talk to my friends. 
[03:25:00]  Now, I often forget that some people consider the way I think to be crude or outrageous.  But it's really just the way I think.  I'm just really honest about it.  Your perception of what happened is completely off.  I wasn't cracking jokes.  I was just talking to you like a friend.  And that is true, by the way.  He brought up something that I think a lot of people wonder.  You break up with someone.  Is she getting banged by someone new?  And would that bother you even though your relationship with this person is done?  I think it would.  It's actually an interesting question. 
[03:25:30]  I could use this blog entry to insult you, but really, what's the point?  I've got plenty of negative bullshit in my life, and I'm sure you do too.  And really, all I want to do is clear the air.  I'm going to post this, and then I'm going to erase all this negative shit from my mind.  And I'm going to look at you the way I looked at you when we were having that conversation.  As a person that's doing a cool fucking thing, playing cards for a living, I'm going to look at you as a person who had the balls to try to make a living in a very risky and unconventional way.  I still respect that very much.  I'm totally serious about holding no grudge, and if we run into each other, I would be happy to shake your hand and bury the whole thing. 
[03:26:00]  Or I might hold you down and slap you in the face with my cock, depending, of course, on how my ego twists my memory of my reaction to your blog entry saying, I suck.  Then he makes a little smiley face.  He writes, kidding.  Kisses Joe.  Smiley face, curly hair.  So if you don't know the whole story, go to JoeRogan.net.  You can hear the audio and then the response and all that.  All right.  That's whatever.  I still have great respect for Daniel Negreanu, even though he bashed the show. 
[03:26:30]  As a poker player, I unfortunately didn't get to meet him personally.  You guys had ruined that for me.  Yeah.  And you wanted to meet him, right?  I wanted to meet him.  If you were into poker, he's one of the guys.  He is like one of the fucking guys.  He's got a talent.  And most people say that poker's all luck.  It's people that really don't know about poker.  He has a talent to reading people where he will call out what the fuck cards they're holding. 
[03:27:00]  He'll be sitting there in a big hand.  And they show the hands on the TV screen.  Obviously, the players don't know what they have.  But he's going, all right.  And let's say the other player has a pair of queens.  He's sitting on a pair of queens.  And Daniel will sit there and look at the board and look at the guy and go, all right.  I know you've got those, you've got a pocket pair, probably queens.  You're sitting on queen.  And you're sitting there going, this motherfucker is reading this guy's mind. 
[03:27:30]  That's pretty cool.  And it's amazing to watch this guy work at poker.  Right.  So it's unfortunate I didn't get to meet him because you guys suggested that his ex-girlfriend,  which is now his wife, was getting guerrilla fucked, as Joe Rogan put it, eloquently put it.  Yeah, but...  Which is why he's mad now.  Yeah.  I would assume, yeah.  That's why I think it came up again after so long.  I bet you it wasn't her.  I bet you if you call him, if you talk a man-to-man off the air, this, that, and the thing, 
[03:28:00]  I guarantee you that he threw the show under the bus for his woman because she got mad at it.  These guys were talking shit.  That probably was.  No, they're fucking low-rate, blah, blah, blah.  And it's like, because she's his wife.  Now, you've got to do that.  Yeah, you've got to protect your girl and then...  Your girl.  You know, the guy, he's a great poker player.  You can never take that away from him.  Oh, he could have been honest and said, you were my ex-girl at the time and you were all 
[03:28:30]  of that.  You were a cunt.  He got married.  Can you read it?  Got married to the woman.  Yeah.  That, you know, Rogan was saying.  Yeah, at the time he was the ex-girl.  So at the time he was like, yeah, that bitch.  Then they got back together.  Got married.  And now they married and he has to fucking, he has to.  Yeah.  He probably, he probably called Joe and fucking...  We got the audio of that video clip.  It's on break.com, the short version.  Oh, we got the audio of the rap guy again.  You can search YouTube, you can get the long version.  It's like 10 minutes long if you have the time to hang around.  I really am in love with it.  So what's the, what's the thing again there? 
[03:29:00]  Oh, it's, they just having a battle.  You know, a little rap, the rap shit.  Aren't these supposed to be peaceful?  Like, you're supposed to, like, just rap.  Yeah, it's supposed to be, but this guy...  You're supposed to know not, there's no fucking punching.  It's rap back and forth.  And if you lose, you just fucking lose.  You lost.  I mean, but this guy was good.  Like, this guy was good.  He was angering, punching you in the face good.  He was rapping and reacting to what this guy was doing.  So if you're like, you know, if I'm rapping and I'm like, yo, and then, and then I go,  you go, you grit your teeth.  And I go, why are you gritting them funky that you can grit all day? 
[03:29:30]  And he was like, and he just, and the motherfucker would hit him.  And he go, oh, you mad because of styling on you.  And it's like, it was the way he was, his delivery was cold and the crowd was like, damn.  And he was flawless.  The motherfucker was just good.  And you could see the other guy was just mesmerized and pissed.  So it just got to a point where you could tell the guy was hitting the other dude.  When he would hit him, you go, oh, you mad.  Like, but he would rap about how the dude was mad. 
[03:30:00]  And it was almost like when you're a kid and somebody point at you and you get your finger on my fucking face.  But that's all you got to say.  This kid, he just says, he says, fuck it.  I'm going to punch him in his face.  Because he just got no choice.  He had no, well, he had no fucking choice.  Don't rap battle if you can't.  If you can't rap battle.  He realized he got in over his head.  He had no come, you know, come back, excuse me.  Like, I didn't see the whole thing, though.  So I don't know what the other kid did, but it's so obvious he wasn't as good as this kid. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  This kid was like, I was watching it before I even know what the video was.  Yeah.  Saying this kid's pretty good.  You know.  Oh, you mad because of style.  All right.  Let's play this.  Here's the audio.  Boys, you got to speak to somebody just to speak to me.  Listen, dog.  You can't eat with me.  And listen, I advise you.  I don't really want to beef with me.  Please.  Wait, wait.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  When he go, listen.  The guy is getting ready to, as he's, the guy goes, he's trying to touch him. 
[03:31:00]  And he's like, yo, get ready to interrupt him.  And the motherfucker's like, listen.  Listen.  And they would just listen.  And the motherfucking rest of the audience is like, damn.  It was embarrassing.  Oh, no.  Because he's like, yo, no.  He's going to go, yo, don't put your hands on.  Listen.  Just play the star of the kid.  Oh, no.  Boys, you got to speak to somebody just to speak to me.  Listen, dog.  You can't eat with me.  And listen, I advise you.  I don't want to beef with me.  Please.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  You got to get a good styling on me. 
[03:31:30]  Listen.  Plus the cowl is on me.  To act up and you'll fucking have to lay down.  Oh, wow.  That is the punch that you hear.  Oh, man.  Listen.  Oh, you mad.  Oh, you mad.  Just I'm styling on you.  He's just reacting to this guy's emotions.  This guy was getting emotional.  Listen.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  All right, hold on.  We got Paul in Bayside.  Paul, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Paul.  If you look at the video, the guy with the green hat, he pointed out that he has a gun 
[03:32:00]  on the side of him.  If you look at the video carefully, he mentions something about a gun, then he points it out.  So as soon as he points it out, the guy just clocked in and ran.  Really?  Watch the video closely.  Yeah.  You're going to have to look closely.  Did the guy run?  There's a part where they show the guy running?  It looked like he was standing there over him.  There's a 10-minute version of this, so that's the whole video.  The guy with the green hat, he told him not to shoot him.  He's holding him down, so he got him pulled out the gun. 
[03:32:30]  If you watch when he hits the ground, he does reach him for it.  Oh, wow.  And then the guy stopped him from shooting him.  Are you sure?  Oh, that was just him pretending he had a cow on him, which was his gun.  Yeah.  But no one comes to a rap battle with the cow on him.  Come on, man.  What's the place in Rome without queens, man?  I don't know, dude.  Yeah, with the cow on him.  Yeah.  I don't know if a nigga comes to a rap battle with the cow on him.  You don't go to a rap battle with the cow on him. 
[03:33:00]  With the cow on him.  You don't.  Everyone knows that.  Everybody knows you don't go to a rap battle with the cow on you.  What's protocol?  When do you carry the cow?  You don't carry the cow on you.  That's all I know.  Never on you.  When are you allowed to be four rap battles?  When is it respected that you carry the cow on you?  Here's protocol now.  You go get the cow.  You get the cow.  From the car.  That's what they do.  Because it's always like someone said they're going to get their gun.  No one ever just pulls out the gun. 
[03:33:30]  It's like, I'm going to get my gun, motherfucker.  And it's like, they got to go and get it.  I mean, he was hurt.  If I thought I could rap, and this guy was telling me, listen.  And I'm like, huh?  Okay, I'll listen to you.  And he was actually good.  Chad, are you mad because of styling on?  I got to hear this.  Break yourself.  Break yourself.  But, hey, Ope, you got to understand, everything he said is reacting to this other kid being emotional.  I hear you.  All right, when you hear the punch, you got to just be quiet so we can take it all in. 
[03:34:00]  I want to hear every.  All right, let's hear this.  Boys, you got to speak to somebody just to speak to me.  Listen, dog, you can't eat with me.  And if, listen, I advise you, I don't really want to beef with me.  Please, are you mad because I'm styling on you?  I better get against styling on me.  Listen, plus the cowl is on me.  So act up, and you'll fucking have to lay down.  So he goes, you're mad because I'm styling on you.  But he also mentions also that he has to be. 
[03:34:30]  Because I got the cowl on me, and you act up, I'm going to have to fucking, and that guy lay down on you.  Wait, this gets better.  So the guy kind of threatened.  It's almost a rap, but it's a rap out.  It's an excuse.  Say whatever the fuck you want.  Yes, it's an excuse to have dick.  If you watch it, listen, listen.  Yo, you mad because I'm styling on you.  Listen, I shut right the fuck up.  Listen.  I'm like, fuck it.  Oh, he's got me.  Are you mad because of styling on you?  Patrice was styling on us. 
[03:35:00]  I had no idea if he's got a cowl on him.  Yo, act up, and you'll lay down.  Yeah.  Unless Kenny's here.  If you watch the video, right?  Yeah.  The dude, before he even raps about guns, the other dude's slapping his hand away.  Yeah.  He's, this is not, he got the gun?  The guy that got punched has a gun.  No.  Besides the fact that he's getting in his face with his rhymes.  No, no.  I don't.  Watch the beginning.  The dude that punches him slaps his hand. 
[03:35:30]  When he says, listen, this guy's getting so emotional, and he's getting his ass whipped,  he slaps his hand down, and the dude, this dude ain't got no fucking gun.  You know what happened?  It went from rap battle to that other guy was losing so bad that he took it so personally  that when this guy said, look, I got a gun, and you fuck up with me, I'm going to shoot  you, is pretty much what he said.  And the guy, instead of just taking it as rap, took it as, this guy's fucking threatening  to shoot me. 
[03:36:00]  That's what they're saying right now.  I got to punch him in the face.  I'm going to peel your cap or whatever.  Right.  It's rap talk.  By the way, Mark from Missouri, Patrice, are you nuts, and then he used the N word,  whatever, carry a cow when they're walking into a bodega to get duchies?  What's a duchy?  Help us out.  Fucking, it had to be a white guy.  What's a duchy?  I don't even smoke weed, and I think they called it a duchy in 19-oh.  What the fuck?  Oh.  Excuse me.  Dutch boy.  Dutch boy, what is it called now?  What you know now to be a blunt, but I have no clue what they call it now. 
[03:36:30]  That's how much, I'm not in that culture, but I know they don't call it a fucking duchy,  redneck.  How about they call it Tree?  Who the fuck, Tree?  Pass the duchy on the left-hand side.  That was 1980.  Give Tree to Stalker Patty's show.  That's what they call it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Tree.  What's the latest one, man?  We all know.  Well, I know it's blunt.  I don't know.  It ain't blunt.  We'll find out, because I don't smoke weed.  I don't know the culture.  I don't know the culture.  Just call it fucking weed.  Endo, maybe?  That might be old.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Philly. 
[03:37:00]  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah, I saw the whole video, and it's, I mean, after the punch, it's pretty much just  like mayhem and shaky camera.  You can't really see, like, anything at all that's going on.  It's pretty disappointing, guys, because I just saw the little clip you did, and just  like a week ago, I guess, the rest of it came out.  And it just, it's just garbage.  It doesn't really show any, any cows or additional punches.  No cows.  No cows.  No cows, y'all.  Cow free.  Cow free. 
[03:37:30]  It's cow free, baby.  No cow, baby.  Listen.  This video isn't fattening.  It's cow free.  What?  That's the news you know.  Listen.  All right, Joe in Oklahoma.  Joe.  He just got really pissed.  He got mad.  He just got mad.  A Dutchie is a cigar.  Yeah, it's, it's a brand.  I don't know what it is, but it's like, who even?  It was Dutch Masters, was it called?  Dutch Masters.  Yeah.  Nobody says that shit.  Like the Dutch guy on the front.  Wait a minute.  You know who said that?  The little Jamaican kid.  Pass the Dutchie on the left-hand side.  In 1982.  When it was. 
[03:38:00]  What were they called?  Musical Youth.  Musical Youth.  Back with fucking Donna Summers.  Yeah, they are.  She sung hard for the money or something, and then this came on.  I think one of the kids is dead or something.  This is old school.  There was something horrific to happen to one of these guys.  It's called shiz.  Shiz is what it's called now.  Who the fuck knows?  You can just name it anything. 
[03:38:30]  Boogie Boogie Boogie Boogie Boy.  That's what they call it.  This was on MTV like every ten fucking minutes.  Every ten minutes.  Yo, I got that Boogie Boogie, yo.  Fuck, that's what I'm calling it.  Boogie Boogie.  That's what they call it now.  Boogie Boogie.  One of our.  Honey drips.  One of our guys in the know says it's currently Blunt.  Blunt.  It's been Blunt for a long time.  All right.  I want to hear this audio again.  Then we got to do Line of the Day, and we're going to get out in time to listen to Stalker  Paddy actually doing a radio show with Limo Anthony from back in the day. 
[03:39:00]  I hope people are noticing that the 11 o'clock hour is very old school.  Oh, yeah.  I personally am enjoying the hell out of it.  So that's what we're going to do today.  All right.  Here's the audio clip again.  Boys, you got to speak to somebody just to speak to me.  Listen, dog, you can't eat with me.  And listen, I advise you, I'm really want to beef with me.  Please.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  I better get Chris Stalin on me.  Listen, plus the cow is on me.  Now act up, and you'll fucking have to lay down. 
[03:39:30]  That's terrific.  Goddamn, I love it.  And the rest of the crowd's like.  You got to fucking lay down the whole shit.  He punched me in the face.  And the rest of the crowd's like, yo, chill.  Like, fucking laugh.  Not what we do here.  People are watching.  We have neighbors.  This is on tape.  Would something like that have made web junk?  Or would that be too violent?  They're too violent.  They're too violent.  That's why that show.  Yeah, that's good shit.  Never would have.  That's the shit you want to see.  I would have had so much fun laughing at that. 
[03:40:00]  Oh.  Oh, you styling on.  Yeah, you could have like.  You styling on while he's fine.  You could have done callbacks on that the whole show.  Act up and you'll lay down.  Really?  Yeah, really?  Really?  You're laying down right now.  He's making your bed.  You got to think of a new slang for punching him in the face.  Yo, I just made his bed, son.  Yeah.  Yo, I just fluffed his pillow for him.  You know how embarrassed that motherfucker must be to all his friends and shit? 
[03:40:30]  Looking and going like I was owning the motherfucker as I was rapping.  And then he just turned around and punches me in the face like that.  But really he's going, yo, man.  Yo, what happened?  Yo, yo, Gliz, what happened?  Yo, that motherfucker.  Yo, you saw that shit, nigga.  I was eating that nigga up, yo.  I was styling on that nigga.  You saw that shit?  That motherfucker.  I was like, listen.  That nigga was listening too.  Yo, son.  Son.  When I told that nigga to listen, the nigga was listening.  And then he going to look for a handshake.  You don't get a handshake. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And yo, man, that motherfucker caught me.  Yeah, he caught me.  He caught me.  He caught me.  He caught me.  He caught me.  But yo, nigga.  Did I fuck him?  Did I eat his ass up?  Did I eat him up?  Ah, yeah, nigga.  You think the other guy is playing that fucking YouTube thing for his friends like the Menace  to the Society tape?  You know what?  In this day and age right now.  I feel sorry for your mother.  That shit right there is embarrassing to the game that they were doing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's almost like two people break dancing.  You're supposed to be able to take it.  And one dude kicks the motherfucker as he's doing a better spin. 
[03:41:30]  Like he's going to watch this shit listen.  I'd like to see that.  And spin it on his head.  And he just comes and kicks him right in his balls.  Because he's better than him.  It's embarrassing.  It's not.  The dude that punched him, you're looking at him like, dude, you're embarrassing.  Yeah.  It's not embarrassing for the kid that got punched.  I mean, niggas got to tease him.  How the hell could he even defend against that?  He was so sucker punched.  Oh, he was eating this motherfucker alive.  He's like, he's creating.  He's there in his head just like fucking creating.  Feeling good.  He's in the zone. 
[03:42:00]  And the next thing he's on the fucking floor going, what the fuck?  It must have been a light fell or something.  The motherfucker couldn't have just punched me.  That couldn't have happened.  What?  So a meteor came through the ceiling and hit me in the head.  I think a bird hit me at full speed.  Yes, something happened.  That is unprecedented.  Nobody punches you during a rap battle.  It doesn't happen.  No.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Very sad news.  No lines of the day today.  What is that about?  What happened?  Bodogfight.com wants to know. 
[03:42:30]  What?  No lines of the day today.  No funny lines?  Oh, boy.  Bodog.  Bodog is going to be mad.  Bodogfight.com.  You're saying for five hours of radio there's no funny lines?  There were lots of funny lines.  Oh, boy.  But?  That's not a sign of a good show.  No.  I even wrote in parentheses, does not reflect quality of show.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  That's the line of the day.  So what does that mean?  Hmm.  Just good conversations today?  We had a lot of serious discussion on race and... 
[03:43:00]  What about Tyra with Kiss My Fat Ass?  That would have been a good line of the day.  She's going to get line of the day?  We can give Tyra the line of the day real quick.  Don't bother.  Don't fucking...  There's no line of the day because there was no line of the day?  This is a first.  This is sad.  I'm going to have to listen to the replay now.  I'm going to pick my own lines of the day.  And chastise some people.  I'm going to pick out lots of lines of the day.  That's what you do in the replay today.  Mm-hmm.  That's something for the website.  How about gang signs?  Pick your own line of the day.  How about gang signs for the fucking video game? 
[03:43:30]  Oh, wow.  Bill just fucking...  Bill just did the hand shaking back and forth thing.  What, Bill?  It was okay.  It was all right.  I can't really argue with that.  It was all right.  If there wasn't any lines of the day, if there was...  You know, it's the fact that there's no lines of the day that that one even makes it in.  It would have been like a third runner-up on a regular day.  Right.  Jesus.  Right.  I got to agree with him, and I fucking can't stand him.  Look at the teaser. 
[03:44:00]  It's all about Bill now.  Who am I?  Yeah.  I'm out of this conversation.  That's the...  Well, at least you give it...  And our first staff member completely dropping off the charts.  That's what I was going to say.  It's Bill.  At least you guys give him the artistic freedom to decide you have no lines of the day.  Bill's just going to go the way of disco in a minute or two here.  You know what, then?  He has artistic integrity.  You know what, then?  Holy shit.  I'm going to bring something up, then.  What?  We're being honest here?  We're being completely fucking honest?  Uh-oh.  All right.  I'll be honest with you.  There are some days you give the guest line of the fucking day to make him feel better. 
[03:44:30]  I fucking know it, too, because I know there are better lines than what the guest fucking said.  I know it.  But we all say, yeah, yeah, you made line of the day.  How about you mad because I'm styling on you?  That's a great fucking line.  Listen.  And then the smack whap of a fucking punch to the face.  So at least be honest.  I've never given a guest a line of the day.  Oh, your line of the day decisions have always been based on integrity and... 
[03:45:00]  Well, we all take a vote.  Take a vote.  Yeah.  Has nothing to do with the guest being there.  Well, no.  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside.  Here's your line of the day.  Fan Eats Cock.  We could pull that real quick.  Ah, that's horrible.  I think...  I can do the intro for Line of the Day, please.  Yeah. 
[03:45:30]  Here you come.  Line of the Day, Line of the Day, Line of the Day, Line of the Day.  Fan Eats Cock.  Wow.  Ah, shit.  Wow.  All right.  Whoa, hey.  Oh, ding dong. 
[03:46:00]  Good morning.  Who is it?  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hi.  I think that was a rebellious statement by Bill.  Wow, really?  Against the oppressors.  Oh.  I think Bill thinks he's oppressed.  All right.  Enough.  That was a civil rights move by Bill.  Yep.  Guys, don't forget, we're less than a week away from So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  We also will have a Brazilian wax on the show on Monday.  Yes.  Is it going to be Bill or E-Rock? 
[03:46:30]  I hope it's Bill now.  And, yeah, so do I, actually.  Absolutely.  He's hairier.  It'll hurt more.  It'll probably be, like, blood.  No, he'll take the pain.  Asshole blood.  Asshole hair rip out blood.  That's what's going to be creepy.  He's going to take the pain.  He's going to need a fucking Kotex.  He's going to have blood from the taint.  Wonderful.  All right.  And, Patrice, thank you.  Tomorrow night, the Black Phillip Show.  Yes.  On 202, 9 o'clock. 
[03:47:00]  Razzle Dazzle.  After the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  What's the Razzle Dazzle Hour this week?  And then Sam's Musical Adventure.  Oh, boy.  What the fuck kind of music does he like?  Give us one song.  One song tease.  What's it going to be?  Turn on your local FM station, and you'll hear one of his great picks.  Is that it?  Oh, Rob Zombie, obviously.  Oh, the zombie, right.  And the white zombie.  We didn't hear about that.  Okay, I forgot.  I forgot really quickly.  It's forgettable music.  I don't want to give away the good one.  No, don't.  There's a good one? 
[03:47:30]  There's lots of good ones.  All good ones.  All good.  All right.  That's the Razzle Dazzle Hour at 8 o'clock.  And then Patrice doing his Black Phillip Show at 9 o'clock on 202 tomorrow night.  Thank you.  Razzle fucking down.  I want to come in early and listen to this fucking albino play his music.  Absolutely.  It's already taped, but they goof on it.  We want you guys to start doing that live, though.  He gave himself two huge thumbs up.  Oh, yeah.  He comes in and just puts his thumbs up and goes, it's going to be great.  In case you missed it, here's Tyra talking back to her critics about her fat picture. 
[03:48:00]  Have a great weekend.  Hot movies contest.  Still happening.  But if I had lower self-esteem, I would probably be starving myself right now.  But that's exactly what is happening to other women all over this country.  So I have something to say to all of you that have something nasty to say about me or other  women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose  names you know, women whose names you don't, women who've been picked on, women whose husbands 
[03:48:30]  put them down, women at work or girls in school.  I have one thing to say to you.  Kiss my fat ass.  Kiss my fat ass. 
[03:49:00]  Hey.  What the hell is going on here?  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you want to vote for Line of the Week, go to iliketolisten.com. </pre>
