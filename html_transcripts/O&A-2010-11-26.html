<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "Black Friday" broadcast opened with a highly offensive and racially charged introduction by the hosts.  The show then featured a series of interviews.  Former Washington D.C. mayor Marion Barry discussed his crack cocaine arrest, denying he smoked crack and claiming the FBI's efforts to entrap him cost millions.  A pre-recorded segment showcased a tense confrontation between UFC fighter Quinton "Rampage" Jackson and comedian Lewis Black, escalating to a near physical altercation.  Floyd Mayweather Jr. was interviewed next, discussing his upcoming Wrestlemania match with The Big Show, his boxing career, and business ventures, expressing apprehension about the wrestling match.  Notorious drug kingpin Frank Lucas was interviewed extensively, detailing his life in the drug trade, including operations in Vietnam, money laundering methods, and experiences with police corruption. He also discussed his book, "Original Gangster," and its differences from the movie *American Gangster*,  providing graphic descriptions of violence and racism from his childhood.

The show continued with further interviews. Frank Lucas's interview continued, focusing on his business practices, avoiding intimidation through superior product quality, his incarceration, and post-prison life. His nephew, Ricky, was briefly present in the studio.  This was followed by an interview with Isaac Hayes, who candidly discussed his four marriages and eleven children (with a twelfth on the way), his experiences with Scientology (including auditing and reincarnation), his defense of the organization, and his role as Chef on *South Park*.  Listener calls about child support and the Scientology *South Park* episode punctuated this segment. Hayes also fulfilled a listener's request for an autograph on air.

Later, Isaac Hayes again appeared on the show, discussing his new album, its varied musical styles, and included DVD footage from a past performance, and recounted a $10,000 gift from Richard Pryor. He also spoke about his career, including his time doing morning radio in New York and returning to an evening show in Memphis after 9/11.  This was followed by an interview with Don King, who promoted an upcoming boxing match at Madison Square Garden, discussed his career, praising Muhammad Ali, and reminisced about various events he promoted. He addressed accusations of exploiting boxers and detailed his manslaughter conviction. Michael K. Williams, known for his role as Omar in *The Wire*, then joined the show, discussing his character, research methods (including time spent in Baltimore), and *The Wire*'s critical success despite limited mainstream recognition.  Tangents included discussions of *Lucky Louie*.

A segment followed focusing on Bob Crane's sex tapes and the accessibility of previously private material online, transitioning into a discussion of the hosts’ experiences with video cameras, including unintentionally recording themselves masturbating.  Michael K. Williams returned, discussing his work with Spike Lee, the intense training involved, his reaction to the death of his *Wire* co-star J.D. Williams (Bodie), and his Omar-themed music project.  Bobby Kelly, whose significant weight loss was a recurring joke, joined the show, discussing his roles in projects like *Lucky Louie* and his book about prostitutes.  Joe Frazier was interviewed next, discussing his boxing career, his rivalry with Muhammad Ali, the "Thrilla in Manila,"  his relationship with Ali, and the physical and emotional toll of their competition. He also discussed Ali's later health and his own health issues, particularly vision problems.

A subsequent interview with Joe Frazier covered his recent personal life (family tragedy, large family, living above his gym), the documentary "Thrilla in Manila," his boxing career and opinions on boxing, including his views on other boxers and criticisms of modern boxing.  He shared anecdotes, including one about Oscar Bonaventa at the Mustang Ranch, discussed his singing, his Olympic gold medal, and his intention to speak with the President about boxing. Finally, Flavor Flav joined the show,  with Patrice O’Neal filling in for Opie and Anthony, and discussed his life, career, and his VH1 show *Strange Love*, featuring his relationship with Bridget Nielsen. The conversation, punctuated by humor and explicit language, included Flav's description of his relationship with Nielsen, avoiding confirmation of sexual relations.  Throughout the broadcast, profanity and sexually suggestive language were frequently used, especially during the Flavor Flav segment.

[00:08:30]  20 million dollars for the fight  And you know his career  And you know  Jimmy of course had to  Kiss his ass  And get something signed  And make everybody uncomfortable  But enjoy  Floyd is funny man  He's a funny motherfucker  Black Friday  With Patrice O'Neal  Oh wow  We gotta behave  Are you kidding me  How are you sir  Good morning  Floyd Mayweather Jr.  Has joined the show  It's Money Mayweather baby  Floyd Money Mayweather  Well where's the money  We saw you throwing it out  At the Hard Rock Cafe yesterday

[00:09:30]  I'll tell you right now  Is it 5 8 158  Yeah 5 8 158  That's me  Absolutely  How did they approach you  About doing this  What happened was  Honestly I was just  Always been a fan of wrestling  You know from the 80's  But now my two boys  Are fans of wrestling  My two sons  9 and 7  So I got invited to  No Way Out  And then somehow  When I was at the wrestling match  The guy called me  I'm like  I'm just here to watch wrestling  So I jumped over  And got in the ring 
[00:10:00]  And punched him in the face  Gave him  Broke his nose  Gave him two black eyes  I went to the back  And they said  What do you think  About getting into wrestling  And I said  It is what it is  And the guy said  He challenged me  In wrestling  He asked me  So next time I went out  They asked me  He asked me  Do I want to face him  In Wrestlemania  The big shot  I said absolutely  So that's how  I got involved  With wrestling  Are you actually  Going to wrestle  Or are you going to  Make him put gloves on  Like you let this  Monster grab you  Or are you going to  This is a no-host  Bars match  This is a little different  From every other match  That's ever been held 
[00:10:30]  You know in Wrestlemania  Everything goes  Why would you do that  Really  You're undefeated  You're 39 and 0  I mean you're fighting  De La Hoya  Against in September  Why would you get  Into the ring  With something this large  Why don't you just  Bite him  Why not  We must see Sunday  Is the risk  Worth the reward  I mean win-lose-or-draw  I mean  We don't mind  We don't mind  Taking risk  You know  I mean all the risk  I've took thus far  Look at the reward  So I feel it was worth it 
[00:11:00]  You're going to  Actually punch him  Will you be  Using your skills  I'd imagine  He's going to  Like go after his package  And use it like  A speed bag  Because I'm thinking  You know  It's going to be hard  To get inside  On a big guy like that  Without him just grabbing you  Like a grizzly bear  Well you know  I've been practicing  With my big man over there  Oh yeah man  How tall are you  Wow  He's like 7'1  Holy  7'1  Is he real  Yeah 7'1  Is he really  No he's actually  7'4  No he's taller than 7'4 
[00:11:30]  Easy  Yeah  Oh hell yeah  That's one of my securities  So you know  We've been practicing  We've been working  I've been working  With some wrestling coaches  Of course my boxing coach  Strength and conditioning coach  Leonard LB  Also my advisor  Sitting next to me  So everything  Everything has been going great  And tremendous  Preparing for  You know  Preparing for  WrestleMania 24  How's Vince  Isn't he like a lunatic  No great guy  You like Vince  Great  Everything first class service  Just like we like  Get in there  And mix it up 
[00:12:00]  I love Vince  He's the best  Genius  They declared you  Ring Magazine  Called you the greatest  Fighter pound for pound  In the world  How many times  Have you switched weight classes  And how many  I mean you keep switching  And you just keep winning  The title  And then you're bored  And you switch again  How many switches have you made  And how many have you won  Since  I think I've been world champion  Like a decade  Now  Wow  Yeah  So  I beat the best at 130  Moved to 135  Beat the best  Moved to 140  Beat the best 
[00:12:30]  Moved to 147  Beat  Beat two of the best  Went to 54  Beat Oscar  Went back down to 54  I mean went back down to 47  And  Manrique hadn't had  You know  One hell of a fight  And now  I'm in  WrestleMania  Well Delahoe  You're fighting again  In September  I mean obviously  He's had his problems  Is that fight still on  I mean is that  You know  You guys trash talk  Before the fight  That would be a great one to use  It certainly would  Well you know  The thing with Delahoe  The first time we fought 
[00:13:00]  The fans wanted to see a knockout  It's the thing  It's something always  In the game  Which Delahoe gave me  Heavyweight gloves  The first time we fought  You know everything was  You know  Geared towards his way  He chose the gloves  He chose the sight  And he chose the weight class  But you know  A lot of fans don't know  That they would have got  A lot more action  If I had the right gloves  I was supposed to have  You know  He had  He said well  Mayweather needs to wear  These gloves  But the gloves he gave me  Was heavyweight gloves  So I mean  Let's both put on the right gloves 
[00:13:30]  And we can really get it on  We can really mix it up  Well how does that work  I didn't know  Were they allowed to choose  Your gloves  Or  Well I was supposed to  Choose my own gloves  He was supposed to  Choose his own gloves  But the gloves that  He gave me  Was heavyweight gloves  I'm just being honest  And he was wearing  Some silk ones  Up to the elbow  It's possible  It's possible  And just like 24-7  Like I told everybody  I said this guy  Is basically fooling  Everybody  I said the truth  Will soon  You know  Everything about Delahoe  Will come out 
[00:14:00]  And you know  At the end of 07  Everybody had a chance  To see  It came out  Lloyd who's tough  For Hatton or  De La Hoya  Hatton's probably  More rugged  But De La Hoya's  More of a technician  Got better skills  Hatton's just  A straight up brawler  Come in  Face first  Don't care  Jeez  It is what it is  However it plays out  Is how it plays out  You've had a lot to say  About the MMA  And the MMA fighters 
[00:14:30]  Right  I just said that  Boxing  Was first  We laid the groundwork  So  Every other  Sport that comes along  That's contact  Should respect  Who laid the groundwork  Which is boxing  The sport that I come from  No disrespect  To no mixed martial arts  Or  No  Fight clubs  Nothing of that  Of that nature  But  You must realize  I don't know  No other fighter  That's in  That's in mixed martial arts  That's making  30 and 50 million a pop  Yeah 
[00:15:00]  They're not  They're not the draw  I mean the pay-per-views  They do  Can't do anything  That boxing  I mean  I mean last year  You know me myself  With the great help of  Of course HBO  You know the vehicle  Who helped get me  To this point  But not just HBO  But  Leonard Ellaby  Al Hammond  And my whole team  Who helped me  Get to this  Get to this point  Has truly  Truly been a blessing  I mean  Because you know  Anytime you call  Of course you see  The quotes  That's in the newspaper  Anytime you call  Mr. Ellaby  Phone  You know 
[00:15:30]  If you ain't calling  For 20 million and up  Don't call at all  But  And it's really  The number's really  Higher than 20 million  We just say 20 million  Just  You know  Just to keep it at low  What do you want  You're trying to kind of  Like just keep it like  Humble  That's 20 million  That's a nice problem  To have 20 million and up  You got some water for  You're undefeated  Right  Yes sir  Who  Have you ever been rocked  Where you went like  Uh oh  I think I'm  I think I'm rocked  And uh  Obviously pulled out of it 
[00:16:00]  But  I've been hit with a good punch  Before  And I said  Are you sure  I chose this to be my job  And so  You never thought  You were in jeopardy  Though of maybe  Like wow  I'm kind of in trouble  Over here  Absolutely not  It's just  I'm still in boxing  To clean the sport up  We got Mayweather promotions  To clean the sport up  We going  We moving on  We also do business  With  The mixed martial arts  And um  UFC and things  Of that nature  You know  But boxing comes first 
[00:16:30]  Boxing comes first  And uh  There's not a bigger  Or better promotion  Company than  Mayweather promotions  The reason why  I'm right where I'm at today  And on this plateau  Is because of  Uh  Self-promotion  And can't nobody  Sell uh  Floyd Money Mayweather  Better than  Floyd Money Mayweather  Are you tempted  To get into  Because Tyson  Had talked about  Getting involved  With the MMA  It was talked about  For a little while  And then he kind of  Stopped for whatever reason  Is that something  That interests you at all  Or are you just  Well me and myself  Um  I'm 
[00:17:00]  You know  I'm a lot older  And a lot smarter  More mature now  Um  I look at everything  As a businessman  Honestly as a businessman  You know  We look forward to  Just making major moves  Any move we make  We want it to be major  Nothing small  Everything major  Are you guys the headline  Fight at uh  At Wrestlemania  It's gotta be uh  It's gotta be  Like I said before  There's no promoter  Bigger than  Floyd Money Mayweather  At first  I was just a preliminary  Bout  That was on the card  Now I'm the main event  And just like uh 
[00:17:30]  Yesterday  When you  Went to the press conference  No disrespect to the other  Wrestlers  Um  I have the utmost respect  For the other wrestlers  But  When you left  When you left  When you left  The press conference  There's only one name  You thought about  There's only one face  You thought about  Because I'm outside the box  And that's what we try to do  We try to be outside the box  What Mayweather promotion  Brings to the table  We try to make the impossible  Possible  We also  We're doing a  The  The Jay-Z and Mary-J  Tour 
[00:18:00]  We've done the Beyonce tour  We've done the Chris Brown  On the Bawar Tour  So we  Mayweather promotions  Are doing so many  Different things  Are getting involved  In so many  Other fields  It's  It's truly a blessing  Now being a  Professional fighter  And a champion  I mean you obviously  Have to like kind of  Hold back  If people try you  In public  Um  When's the last time  You had an altercation  That was something that  You understand what I mean  Like the reason I don't  Hit people in public  Is because I'm not  A particularly good fighter  So I'm probably  Getting knocked out a lot  What stops you 
[00:18:30]  From doing it  That would just feel  So good to be able  To walk into a bar  And knock anybody's  Team  No we can't  Well last time  I got into  An altercation  Where I  Was Big Show  Actually  Oh yeah  That was legit huh  Oh yeah  It felt good  What me and Big Show  Is doing Sunday  Is not like  What um  Every other wrestler  You know  Is doing  It is no holds bar  You know  May the best man win  It's definitely 
[00:19:00]  Going to be interesting  He don't like  He don't like me  And I don't like him  Period  I keep picturing  Like Hulk Hogan  Throwing Rocky  Out of the ring  Yeah right  It's like Rocky 3  Vince is trying  To get Rocky 3 going  Anything  Anything is possible  Right  That's why we want  All the fans  That's tuning in  Right now  On the best station  In the nation  Listen to the best  Fighter in the world  You must tune in  Sunday  And watch  You forgot the best  Radio show in America  This is the  You might as well  Drag us into this  Of course  Best station in the nation  Best show

[00:24:30]  But the money is always better  Wow  Yeah but  Did you  And I'm very remorseful about that too  That's a bad thing I did  I don't  It's not good  You have regret about it?  I sure do  Big time  That's why I'm talking to kids  All over the country now  And what do you tell them  When they  Because again  The money  It's hard to say no  To that kind of money  Well  Who in hell wants to stop  Making a million dollars a day?  You know  That's kind of hard to do  But hey  You know what  It was a bad thing that I did  And for that I'm sorry  But it's a deal 
[00:25:00]  There ain't nothing I can do now  Back in those days  Were there moments  Where you would realize  Like wow  This is a really dangerous thing  That I'm dealing  And feel bad about it  Or would just  Did it not bother you at all?  Always  I always know it was a dangerous thing  I always know that  But  Would you feel guilty then or no?  No  But now I do  Really?  What kept you from feeling  Any kind of remorse  Back then?  Because obviously  You were in a business  Where people were dying 
[00:25:30]  Yeah  I couldn't  I couldn't go to Wall Street  And get a job  Mopping up  Mopping up the toilets  Yeah  I had to do  I wanted some money  I had to do something  So I started that  And it seemed to be all good  And I went on from there  What got you into that?  Like you know  You're from the south  And what exactly happened  That kind of sparked you  Into that life?  When I was  About six years old  I guess you could call them  The clan  The rednecks  Coming out of the house  And I  Took my first cousin  Out on the 
[00:26:00]  On the porch  And tied his arms up  And shoved the shotgun  In the tip  The butt of the shotgun  Hit him in the mouth  With it  Like all the T-fight  Ropes and tied  Around the hand  And shoved the shotgun  Double barrel shotgun  Into his mouth  And pulled both barrels  Simultaneous  His face looked alright  But you put a watermelon  In the back of his head  So they blew the back  Of his head out  How old was he?  13  Wow  You know what  They got him for?  Reckless eyeballing  Reckless eyeballing 
[00:26:30]  Oh yeah  He looked at a white girl  Walking down the street  Oh boy  That'll do it  So they came  And they  Now they knew  You were watching  Or you were  Kind of watching  From a window  Or you were sitting  No I ran  When they tried him  I ran around the house  Out the back side  And ran around the house  No people  Around the corner  So you see something  Like that I guess  When you're six  And the message  Here is that's like  I've seen somebody  Get shot already  I guess it's a little easier  Man it's fucked up  What I'm gonna say  It's messed up  My mind ain't got right yet  Wow  Yeah  I still see it 
[00:27:00]  In my dreams  I see it all the time  Are you someone  Would you consider yourself  I mean a million dollars  A day operation  In what was that  Like 1969  1970  In those days  You got it  Right back then  Would you consider yourself  Would you say  Were you a ruthless guy  In that business  I mean I guess  You had to be  Anybody in that business  Taking that roof  Is they lying  They have to be  Because you gotta get paid  You know it's okay  To respect somebody  But when you  When they fear you  That's when you get paid  That's when you get paid 
[00:27:30]  When they fear you  And they were afraid of you  Well  I said fear you  I said fear you  I guess you could say  Scared of me  Yeah  How did American Gangster  Portray you  Like Denzel  I thought was  Tremendous in that  Do you feel like  He did at least  An accurate job  Of playing you  As a man  Played it to the T  He played it to the T  He did it  He did it  He did  Just what I did  He did it  And a lot  He didn't do  Because I didn't tell him  About it  A lot he didn't do 
[00:28:00]  There were things there  That you kind of  Wanted to keep secret  I mean is it  Statue of Limitations  Things that don't run out  That you kind of  Wanted to  Yeah you got plenty  Statue of Limitations  Don't run out  If I tell you everything  I'd probably be in jail  For the rest of my life  What  The interesting thing  About you too  Is that  You were  A rare case  Is that you were  Kind of a  Quiet guy  On that level  You weren't a flashy guy  No  Did instinct tell you  Not to be that way  Yeah absolutely  I made a mistake  When I went to the  The Muhammad Ali 
[00:28:30]  Boxing match  And  Or that  Tinchilla coat  And the hat  Matching hat  And all that kind of stuff  I got flashy  One time  In my life  And that was  Bad thing to do  And that was 1971  Or something  Well when I was  Muhammad Ali  And the Joe Frazier fight  Well that's when it was  So it's an interesting story  Because you were there  They said you had better seats  Than Sinatra  You had better seats  Than Dustin Hoffman  You had better seats  Than I think  He said  I had better seats  Than anybody  And nobody knew 
[00:29:00]  Who you were  Like the cops  Didn't know who you were  They know that night  Yeah  They found out that night  Yes they did  What inspires you  To spend $100,000  On a jacket  In 1970  Which is how much  The jacket  And a $25,000 hat  Yeah  $25,000 hat  $100,000 for the coat  What a question  Yeah well I can tell you  That goes back  To the fight  He had in Atlanta  The guys from California  Now we come down  In that casual dress  You know  Going to a fight  Coming casual dress  Them guys had them 
[00:29:30]  Maint coats  Smoking the pipes  And big diamond rings  And all that  You know  I don't know  If it was diamonds  Or not  Get a diamond  That big  Because you  Price a rose rose probably  But they had that on  And they was  Kind of giggling  As I said  Bring your ass  To New York  I'll show you  So you felt like  You were being laughed at  By other guys in there  No they were laughing  Not the whole New York crowd  They were sneaking about  Yeah  Everybody from New York  Nobody come down  Everybody come down  You know  That's the fight  But the guys from California  Not that way  They came all decked out 
[00:30:00]  So when you're standing  There with a $100,000 coat  And Ali and Frazier  Are both kind of stopping  And greeting you  On the way into the ring  They did that  They shook my hand  Joe Frazier  Just like  Ali shook my hand  And Joe come by  And give me a big hug  And all that  So that made the cops notice  I don't know why  But they did  Well probably  Because yeah  That would definitely  Be noticeable  You know  That's certainly noticeable  And it's something  You kind of said  You've regretted  Yes I do  I regret that night  And I regret what I did 
[00:30:30]  It wasn't a good thing  To do  Nicky Barnes  Was the guy  That like  I grew up  I'm 41  So I remember  I guess  You know  20 years ago  I would hear about  These legendary  Drug dealers in New York  And Nicky Barnes  Was the guy  You heard about  Even  Well he's like  In jail for life  Now isn't he  Yeah  No he's not in jail  No more  Is he out  Yeah  Oh I didn't even know that  He's been out  For about two years now  Three years now  That's called research  That I didn't do  Yeah  Yeah  But he did a lot more time  Than you did  Yes he did  Yes he did  Now you want to know  You want to know 
[00:31:00]  I guess you get into  The question  The question is  Did you see the movie  I did see the movie  Yeah  Did you see what  The cops did to me  They took like  Two million dollars  A week from me  One time  They were taking from me  Baby facing them  Shaking you down  Shaking me down  They give me a key  And ask me to sell it for them  And all that bullshit  You know  But what I did was  They put me  They got mad  Because I had  An apartment over here  In the house  In the regions  They had a top  They had a penthouse  In both of them 
[00:31:30]  Regions  And I go there  And I had to hide out  From them  When they saw me  They got mad  And they locked me up  They locked me up  And that's when  The ball started rolling  They locked me  They told on me  Of course I  Of course I got them back  So wait  The cops were taking  At one point  Two million dollars  A week  About six million dollars  More than that  Eight million dollars  A month  Or something like that  They were taking  Half of my pay  How do you distribute  That much  Wow  To bring in  That much money 
[00:32:00]  How do you have  You would need  An army  Of people on the streets  Selling  Wouldn't you  Man I had an army  Yeah  Yeah I did  How many people  Did you have working  For you at one point  I had one guy  Working for me  One guy  A guy named Doc  Working for me  Doc Holliday  Working for me  That's all I had  I didn't know  Nobody else  Didn't see nobody else  Didn't know nothing  About nobody else  He took them  From there  And right on down  The line  So how did you know  That you weren't  Being stolen from  When you're kind of  Just dealing with  One guy  No  I had a friend 
[00:32:30]  Her name was Red Top  She did the cutting  And everything  She passed it out  And she gave me  The numbers  And I know  What I was supposed to have  Now you got  You were really smart  Because you  You know  Guys usually buy drugs  And they're cut  But what made you  Gave you the inspiration  To go to Vietnam  And just get it yourself  From the source  Well  Bill Brutel  And Roger Grimsey  I don't know if you remember  The news guys  Sure sure  They used to come in there  Good evening  Here at 90 news  That's what they would say  And  They were talking about Vietnam  How the guys were getting high 
[00:33:00]  Over there  And how painful the drug  Was over there  And all that  I took notice  I said hell  I must even get some over there  You know  I'm going to do something  So wait  A news report  On how the guys in Vietnam  Were getting high  And how powerful the drugs  Were kind of inspired you  The soldiers  The soldiers  The soldiers  The soldiers  If they make them  GIs high  They're making a high  Over here  You know  So when you went over there  How did you know  Who to go to  Or how did you arrange that  I mean the movie  I did see  But  I didn't know  I didn't know  Who to go to  You didn't see that  In the movie  I don't think  It was in the movie  Okay  I didn't know  Who to go  I did it  Almost a month  Maybe a little better 
[00:33:30]  Than a month  Looking for somebody  Looking for somebody  Everybody had  20 keys  30 keys  I didn't want that  I wanted a couple  Of hundred keys  And that's what I got  So how did you get  The drugs out of  Vietnam back here  Military  Through the military  Yes  Oh my god  Come on  Look at what they're  Willing to do  For 800 bucks a month  You get a couple  Hundred grand  You can get anything  You want from  The order back over here  Okay  So the military  Would help you 
[00:34:00]  Smuggle it  Yeah  Look one guy  I get the boss  I would just go  We should go  See the boss  And I can't call his name  I will not call his name  Go see the boss  And he would take you  Up from there  All you had to do  Is bring it on the post  Give it to him  He would do what  He had to do  And this is in the  U.S. military  Yeah  And they tell me  What way to pick it up  What day to pick it up  What time to pick it up  To the military  Precision time  Was anybody  Indicted from the military  No  No huh  No 
[00:34:30]  Hmm  Now  That's amazing  When you went  Did you go over to Vietnam  With a tremendous amount  Of money  To  Or did you kind of  Expect it to be fronted  When Bumpy died  He didn't want  He didn't want to do that  Bumpy is the guy  Who you worked for  Bumpy Johnson  Worked for 13 years  Nine months and eight days  I worked for Bumpy  But he was a guy  That  He was a guy  That  Didn't want to do it  So when he died  He had like  Three million dollars  Left in the street  I went and collected  The money  Put it in Chase Bank 
[00:35:00]  Because Chase got  Branked all over there  You know  But in Chase Bank  And I had the money  In the bank  All I had to do  Get a passport  Enough money  To get there  Where I had money  You know  How do you wash  A million dollars a day  I mean  Because back  Especially  It's all cash  You didn't read  You must have  Didn't read about me much  Because if you did  You'd know how I did it  Well I know you had  A couple of legitimate businesses  You had  No  I did it through the bank  For the most part  I had few legitimate businesses  But I worked  Did it through the bank  I take it to the bank  Did it clean it up 
[00:35:30]  I had to pick it up tomorrow  Like five million  Ten million  Whatever I had to take in  Did it clean it up  I had to pick it up tomorrow  Chemical bank  They got indicted for that  Oh they did  Chemical bank for laundering  Yeah they got indicted for that  Yes they did  How much would you bring it  At a time  And like  I don't know how it works  Like you say you have  Ten million dollars  And you want to wash it  You bring it to the bank  And what do you  Daddy cleaned up for me  They give me all hundred dollar bills  And how much would they charge  For a ten million dollar  They take two percent  Or three percent  Sometimes  More just four percent 
[00:36:00]  I have paid  Alright so basically  That's not that much  That seems like  No it's not that much  No it's not  But they would make  That was a good dollar for them  So where do you keep  Once they wash it for you  Where do you keep  That kind of cash  In the Cayman Islands  Oh you put it in the Caymans  Yes  And I know you stored  Some in your house  Which  No  I had like twelve million dollars  Twelve million  Oh five hundred  Some thousand dollars  But when they turned it in  It wasn't but a  Five hundred thousand  So you had twelve million 
[00:36:30]  And they raided the house  Yeah  And they said they found  A half a million  That's why they said  They found  You read that  Oh man  Oh shenanigans  Next thing you know  The cops showing up  In the fight  With a hundred thousand  Dollar fur coat on  A twenty five thousand  Dollar hat  Hey Flatfoot  You don't make  That kind of scratch  I don't know  How they did it  But all I know  The money wasn't there  I don't know  Who took it or what  But I know  It wasn't there  So did a lot of  There was a whole  Corruption thing  That happened  After you got in trouble  There was a lot of cops 
[00:37:00]  That I think went down  Right  Absolutely  How many guys  Were actually  You know I have no idea  I don't know  I don't know  I have no idea  But I know  Maybe twenty five  Or thirty  Maybe more  And the guys  That were actually  Taking from you  They went  Like the guys  That were shaking you down  They told on me  I told on them  Simple as that  I told on them  Have you  Like  Being a guy  Who's kind of  Been  It's amazing to be  You're seventy nine 
[00:37:30]  Yeah  And most guys  In that business  Don't tell my age  On the radio  I'm sorry  I'm only a kid  I'm only a kid  I'm seventy nine years old  I'm on September 9  Nineteen thirty  Most guys  Don't  In that line of work  Don't make it to seventy nine  To kind of  Come out the other side of it  And write books  And talk about what happened  Well  I don't know about most  But I know  I've been lucky I guess  I guess I've been lucky  How have you seen that  Change  Like you know  I mean there's always guys  Dealing drugs  How has the mentality 
[00:38:00]  Of these guys changed now  From the time  When you were doing it  Well  It's  Different  Back then  You had rules  The kids out there  They don't have no rules  They kill one another  Murder one another  For nothing  For twenty dollars  They kill you for twenty dollars  They murder you  We didn't do it back then  That bumpy  And all those times  They had rules  I fell in the same footsteps  I had rules  I went by  What was  What was the rule  Do you think  That you would have  Abided by  That today  That they just  Don't care about 
[00:38:30]  The rules  I would abide by  You gotta be straight  See you can  See that's why  I had all  Most country boys  Work for me  You can trust  The country boy  You can put  A million dollars  In his house  And his wife  And kids  Can be hungry  He won't touch  Nate Penny  Before he come  Tell you  But the city boy  That son of a bitch  Will steal your eyeballs  Out  That son of a bitch  Will steal your eyeballs  I had people  I could trust  Put it that way  If they legalized drugs  Would you get back  In the business  No  No  I don't want  Nothing to do with drugs  Would you franchise  No  No more drugs  No more drugs  No  No 
[00:39:00]  Absolutely not  Alright  Absolutely not  No more drugs  Never  Never  I'm very remorseful  Of what I did  And it's not a good  Thing what I did  But hey  It's a done deal  And I  Yeah  Just move on  That much  Best I can do  Talk to the kids  And tell them  Don't go this way  When did that  Change in your mind  When did you  Realize  Wow  That's not a good thing  Well we had a trial  I don't know  If you know  The guy named  Richard Roberts  He was a state prosecutor  We had a trial  Over there 
[00:39:30]  And the lady  Said she'd come home  We was on trial  She said she'd come home  And she'd find her son  With her needles in her arm  And when she got through  Testifying that day  Even I was crying  Damn  Damn  Even I was crying  When she got through  Testifying  I know I was gone  I know there ain't  No comeback now  You know  When she got through  Testifying  I feel very remorseful  And I feel like a dog  And I ain't never  Touched drugs since  Because hearing somebody  Actually really describe  What it was like to watch  Yeah  She told a whole story 
[00:40:00]  They must have  Practiced her  Two months  Six months  Oh damn  She'd know every word  She'd know how to put  Oh my god  That lady was  Hey  You'd have been crying  If you said that  Before that  It was just business for you  It was just  Business as usual  Yeah  It was a product  That you were selling  My wife tried to get me  To stop a long time ago  But who the hell  Wants to stop  Making a million dollars a day  You know  That's hard to just stop  Yeah  Just stop right on your track  You know  And I'm getting from  I move from  A couple hundred  To three thousand keys  When I go over there  To bring it back  So three thousand 
[00:40:30]  How  I  I stopped  I stopped drinking  And doing drugs  When I was eighteen  So I don't know  How much does a key  Cost and how much  Does it resell for you  Well in New York  In New York  Over this way  It was selling for like  Maybe  Maybe eighty thousand  Seventy thousand  Per key  Over there  I was paying  Four thousand  Two hundred  For you  Oh wow  That's a hell of a problem  Forty two hundred  And it sells for eighty thousand  Oh yeah  Yeah  And if I  It was like a hundred percent  I never got nothing  Under the ninety percent 
[00:41:00]  Like a hundred percent  And I could cut it half  And two  And sell it over here  For eighty thousand  If I wanted to  Yeah so that's  I had a street business  Going  I had  I was selling a lot  In the streets  I was selling  A hundred thousand  Million dollar  A day  That was just my street  But it had nothing  To do with the wholesale  So you didn't have  People that were  Selling  To people  That were using  Were you pretty much  Selling bulk  To other dealers  No  The guy named  Doc  He run the street  Business for me  Oh okay  And how he did it 
[00:41:30]  I know  But it's a long story  So I don't have time  To tell all that  Here in the radio  Today  But anyhow  He run the street  Business  And I run more  To the wholesale  Business  What was the name  Of  Didn't you have  The name  Of the actual  Blue Magic  Blue Magic  Yeah  And that kind of  Became legendary  On the streets  Yes  It still is  I made a friend  By the same  Blue Magic  They know exactly  What you're talking  You could sue  Yeah  Super copyright  In front of me  Yeah yeah right 
[00:42:00]  I don't think  Are you alright  You alright  Yeah  Sam  Okay  Is he bothering you  No no  I don't mind  I would love to see  You punch Sam  That would really  Make me happy  He bothers us  Thank you  Oh that's good  They bring the book  In a plastic bag  Like it's some kind  Of drugs  What are you doing  What is that  It's the film  American Gang  I want to get  The book signed  Let me see if I can  Get the book signed  I autograph it  Before I leave  If you will  So do you think 
[00:42:30]  The Rico Statutes  Which kind of  Put a lot of  Years on people  Did that change  The whole game as well  Because now guys  Couldn't just take  A five year hit  No the Rico Statutes  That was  A prosecutor dream  It didn't have to  Go that much  To convict you  All they had to do  Is somebody  Like we sitting  Here talking about  Drugs now  They know you're  Not in drugs  But they come back  Y'all talking about  You should have  Told the courts  Or whatever it is  You should have  Told the courts  And you didn't know  You know the body  So you should have 
[00:43:00]  Reported  You know  As a Rico Stat  They can get  So then  They put everything  Together  So they can  Kind of lump us  All in as a  As conspirators  And I think  The thing with that  Is this way  They get lower guys  To roll over  On the guys  That's exactly  That's exactly  That's exactly  I'm telling you  When I was in court  I had guys  That I'd never  Seen before  They said  They worked for me  And I  Who the hell are you  You know  Where did you come from  Nose running  Snorting  High in the courtroom 
[00:43:30]  Telling me you worked for me  And all the hell  You didn't work for me  They were just trying  To give something  To lighten their own sentence  What is it like  When someone is  Testifying against you  Terrible  You don't want to hear it  You don't want to hear it  No you don't  Does it make you angry  Of course it do  Of course it makes you angry  Somebody telling something  On you  Where you know  You didn't have  Nothing to do with  That would make you  Pissed off too  Did you ever have to  Face somebody in court  Who you had trusted  At one point  Who like at one point  You would have confided in them  And then just to hear  Them blabbing  Well  Once I had a guy  Named Charles Morris 
[00:44:00]  On the stand  Testifying against me  And he hoped me out  He really hoped me out  He really hoped me out  I didn't get convicted  Because his testimony  He know what he was doing  I know him  He know what he was doing  And I would like to  Shake his hand today  But I don't know  Where the hell he's at  Oh so he  He didn't hang out to dry  No he didn't  He hoped me out  He hoped me out  He got on the stand  He hoped me out  He couldn't remember  Bye bye bye  And when the  The French lawyer  That wasn't the way  It was 
[00:44:30]  You know  Bye bye bye  Oh he might have  Had a change of heart  Yeah  Absolutely  Absolutely  I don't know  If they locked him up  For that or not  But I know  He helped me a lot  I would think  A lot of people  Would be intimidated  To go up against you  He helped me out  He helped me out  Man he helped me out  A lot  I'm telling you  I didn't get convicted  How do guys now treat you  Because you are  You don't know many  Ex-drug dealers names  I mean  And you're like  A legendary guy  Especially since the film  Do guys kind of  Approach you now  And try to ask you 
[00:45:00]  For advice about it  Or what's the reaction  To guys in that business now  I got a lot of people  Asking me for advice  On that  And I tell them  Like I'm telling you  Man stay away from that  That's no good  They got so  They don't ask me no more  Because they know  What I'm going to say  They know you're not  Going to give them  Business advice  No hell no  I'm not going to do that  Business advice  I know  It would just seem  Like an odd thing  To do  But it's the truth  They do  They actually  Come up  Wow that's  That's  That's a dumb thing  For people to do  So this was also  Interesting to me too 
[00:45:30]  In the 80's  When crack became  That also seemed  To change the way  Business was done  Crack changed  The whole thing  You know what  See  Cocaine is a  Is a  Used to be a rich man  Drug  And then it got  So they  Refined it  Down to crack  And everybody  Started smoking it  And they went crazy  They went crazy  Smoking that shit  Went crazy  That's what they did  What do you think is  The Jamaican gangs  At one point  They seem to be 
[00:46:00]  Breaking a lot of rules  That like the mafia  Had  That other traditional  Drug dealers had  Like when they shot  Ed Byrne the cop  I think it was his name  Ed Byrne  They executed him  Guarding a witness  It was like  They were just doing  These things  That other guys  Didn't do  Which kind of  Forced the police  To react  And I think  They react  In an appropriate way  In a case like that  You just don't do that  If the cop  Get you  You got  You don't try  To kill no cop  No you don't  You take  That's their job 
[00:46:30]  To catch you  They catch you  Say hey  They got me  That's it  You don't go  Try to kill him  No the hell  You don't  You don't do that  That's one of the rules  You know  If it wasn't for the cop  We'd be in trouble  We'd be in big trouble  You know  Because it just brings  Heat on everybody  That's what they do  Bring heat on everybody  Them kind of guys  Bring heat on everybody  Yes they do  They don't know  What the hell they're doing  And it seems like  The Jamaican guys  Had a few years  Of a run  Like where they were  They were violent  And they were making  A lot of money  But then they were gone  Because they forced  The people to come after them  They were putting 
[00:47:00]  Their ass in jail  Putting them away for life  And that stopped all that  You know  Nobody wants to go to jail  For life  Nobody  How much time did you do  How much jail time  Did you actually do  Well I can give you  The longest time I had  The longest time I had  I did like seven and a half  Eight years  One time  Right down in Park Road  So what's it like  Being a guy  Who's making a million dollars  A day  And having pretty much  The run of the city  And then just being forced  To  Hell I had to run  To the jail  Oh you did  Yeah  I don't know why 
[00:47:30]  I would assume  That he'd go to jail  I had to run  To the jail  Yes I did  Yeah  Alright so you're  Out of the life now  For a pretty long time  I'm out of life  Permanently  Permanently  Yeah  And you're doing a signing tonight  I'm going to give out the information again too  Now this  What is the difference between this book  And it's called Original Gangster  The real life story  Of one of America's most notorious drug lords  And the signing tonight  Six o'clock at Borders Penn Station  Which is at Madison Square Garden  What is the difference between this book 
[00:48:00]  And kind of the story of American Gangster  Or is it kind of the same  The book is not  The book is never like the picture  I'm telling you  That's my autobiography  I'm telling you the truth in that  Okay  Everything is right on the money  Nothing elaborated for Hollywood  I didn't cut no corners there  Did you write American Gangster  Or was that written about you  That was written about me  I didn't write it no  Oh so this is actually  Okay the first one  That's coming from you  Yes  The American Gangster  Is coming from me  Are there any things  In the film that didn't happen  That you looked at  I'm not going to tell you that 
[00:48:30]  No huh  Okay  I think  There is  I'm not on there anyway  Yeah  There is one scene  Which you don't have to see  Yeah yeah  That's what I'm thinking about  We're all thinking of the same scene  Yes the same scene  Where Denzel  On the street  Walks in the street  And just  The guy's played by  Idris Elba  Who was  String a bell on the wire  And he just walks up  And he shoots him  In the head in the middle of the street  I don't know nothing about that  Alright Frank knows nothing about that  There's no statue  I'm taking his word for it  That was just a good scene 
[00:49:00]  In the movie  They got to jack it up  For Hollywood  You know that  Yeah  Yeah  Did Frank Lucas at his prime  Get more pussy  Than Denzel Washington  That's a good question  Everything from  8th Avenue  From a Hollywood movie  To 8th Avenue  You're a hoe  A little bit of it all  Yeah yeah  Stanhope  He asked a good question  You were having an affair  With Willie Mays' daughter  No stepdaughter  Stepdaughter  Yeah  His stepdaughter  Did Willie know about that? 
[00:49:30]  I don't know  How did that  Willie never came around  He never came around  Willie didn't bother  Bothered him no more  Didn't you steal a girl  From Wilt Chamberlain?  Or was it another athlete?  Yeah  How do I put this?  I really don't know  How to put it  Yeah I got a girl  Yes  From Wilt Chamberlain  Yes I did  According to Wilt though  You probably  You probably got a girl  That Wilt had  Yeah Wilt did fuck everybody  But yeah  There was some story 
[00:50:00]  About how you were at a party  And there was somebody  That he was with  That just left with you  In my club  I had a nightclub  That was  52nd and Broadway  The old Birdland  The turntable  You probably heard about that  The old turntable  The old Birdland  You heard about the old Birdland  You heard about Birdland  Didn't you?  No  You're a New York guy?  I grew up in Jersey  Well hell you're right  Cause really you had to hear  About Birdland  I was a nerd  Yeah you were at Birdland  And I right there  Right downstairs  I had a club  It called The Turntable 
[00:50:30]  The Lord Price Turntable  You know who Lord Price is  Don't you?  No who's Lord Price?  He's a good friend of mine  Lord and Miss Claudia  You got personality  And that kind of thing  No  Oh my god  Where the hell you been?  I know  I lived a sheltered life  Yes you did  I did a little drugs  I drank a little bit  So you just  Was there anybody  In that period of time  When you're making  That kind of money  And everybody's kind of  Is there anybody  That you were afraid of  Or that were intimidated by? 
[00:51:00]  How could I be out in the street  During the business I was in  Like I wouldn't be intimidated  Well that's what I'm saying  Well that's  That stuff is mandatory  Hell no  Nobody  Nobody  And if there was  You wouldn't have allowed them  To know it  I don't think  They could have  Been around too long  They're going to intimidate me  That is pretty self-explanatory  Yeah it is  Known as a business  That you don't want  Competition  Around  Well hey  I didn't have no competition  Because the stuff  I was getting  I was putting like  10% in the street  Everybody I was putting 
[00:51:30]  Like 5, 6, 7%  And they bought my stuff  But I didn't care  Who sold  Yeah you don't see  That work ethic  With drug dealers nowadays  That's something of the past  You just get  Shitty drugs now  Did you  Did you have situations  Where there were people  That were  Kind of  Trying to  Edge in on  Your business  And had to be dealt with  They could sell  Right beside me  I didn't care  Because they weren't  Going to buy their stuff  Anyway  They were going to buy my stuff  I had the best stuff  I told you I was getting  For free almost  You know  They couldn't compete 
[00:52:00]  So the big  A lot of times  The big violence happens  Because guys are fighting  Over territory  I know  See that  See that's bullshit  If you got  If you're out  In the street  And you're in the drug business  You got to have the best  Because if you don't  Have the best  You ain't going to  Make no money  So you got to have the best  I made a lot of money  I had the best all the time  Were you always afraid  Like  Alright this is going  To end  Someday  It's like you're pretty much  Just living like  I know this is going to end  Very very  I mean  What's your mentality 
[00:52:30]  When that's happening  About getting caught  I was a damn fool  I didn't care  I didn't care  I didn't think about tomorrow  You're just living day to day  All I had to save my money  Is put my money up  And make sure  That when I got ready  I could retire  Never have to worry no more  That's what I did  The government took all my money  Yeah  What would you say on tax  Like would you file taxes  Back then  Or would you just not  Now you want me to say  That I'm ready to go  Oh okay  Oh yeah  Plus you did have  Legitimate businesses  So that could have 
[00:53:00]  Yeah yeah  I pay taxes  I pay taxes  On my business and stuff  Yes I did  But you went to jail  I mean you did your time  It's like  You're free and clear now right  I mean you  Yeah I don't know  Nobody nothing now  It's got to be a nice feeling right  Yeah  The best feeling I ever had  You know what I'm saying  You're talking to you guys  Now back then  I couldn't sit here  And talk to you  No  I would probably ask you a question  You'd probably tell me  To shut the fuck up  And I would  And walk out the door  Smack him in the head  And tell him to shut up  Is this your first  Have you done book signings before  Or is this your first one  It's the first one

[00:58:00]  What I call  Bike tracking  Live up in a hotel  On the sandy beach  Somewhere  And think back  Through the years  And see how I did  For the last two years  With the cop close to me  What I did wrong  What I should do  How I should clean it up  I was out there 14 years  Before they even know my name  Oh so you would basically  Go away  And just kind of  Collect your thoughts  And strategize  Exactly what I would do  Exactly what I would do  Assess what you're doing wrong  Maybe fix a few things  Stay a couple of steps ahead  Spiritual retreat  Yeah right  Do all that 
[00:58:30]  And straighten everything up  And clean it up  Clean it up  And go to work again  Getting jammed up for so long  14 years  Before I didn't even know my name  And Nicky Barnes  I really thought he was in jail for life  I didn't realize he had been out  For a while now  He'd been out like two  Maybe three years now  Okay  Do you guys have a good relationship  Or do you have no relationship  I have no relationship with Nicky  No?

[01:20:30]  Hey Darren  Hi Jimmy  Welcome back bro  Thank you  Listen  My question is for Isaac Hayes  Yo  What are your child support payments like  Do you pay child support  I'm going through that  Oh man  I got three  It caused me a fortune man  Trust me  I'm doing a math over here  Now it's a good thing  That some of them  Kind of aged out  But then you go  And get back into the fine past  Yeah but you know  I never was a deadbeat dad  I took care of all my kids  I know where they are  That's beautiful  That's beautiful 
[01:21:00]  I stay in touch with them  And I even give my grandkids  Gifts for Christmas  You know in fact  The kids are grown now  So I give my grandkids  Gifts  I mean I'm into  Literacy and education  So I buy them  Gifts from Toys R Us  The little ones  And the older ones  I give them gifts  From department stores  And I give them all  Gift to bookstores  Because I want them to read  And I just make sure  They're literate  Alright  Thanks Darren  Let's go to Tony in Wisconsin  Tony  Hey my question is for Isaac Hayes 
[01:21:30]  Yo  Hey  What did you think  You're Scientologists right  Yeah  Okay what did you think  About when Matt and Trey  Did that episode  On South Park  About Scientology  Well  With crews in the closet  Well  Yeah that was a great episode  They reran it  I think last week too  One thing about  One thing about  Matt and Trey  They lampoon everybody  And if you  If you take that shit serious  Then I'll sell you  The Brooklyn Bridge  For two dollars  Yeah  You gotta realize  What they're doing  Yeah that's what they do 
[01:22:00]  And take it  That's what they do  What is Scientology all about  I still don't understand it  You still don't understand  It's UFOs and stuff  No  It's cleansing the body  I really don't  I'm not  I don't understand it though  That's all  But I don't understand  The Catholic faith either  For years and years and years  No  Scientology  Scientology is an applied  Religious philosophy  See people get it all mixed up  And all I say is  You know  Read a book  Read about it  We got books  That explain all about it  And when I got into Scientology 
[01:22:30]  I was just like everybody else  I heard  I heard you guys  I was going on hearsay  And the lady told me  I said look  Why don't you take a course  And see for yourself  When I took a course  The first course called  Overcoming ups and downs in life  And I took that course  Halfway through the course  I said damn  I'm learning something  Shit  I was finding answers  About me  About life  That I had never known  And then I took another course  I wanted to take another course so bad 
[01:23:00]  But I wouldn't give it a satisfaction  I was blown away  I said well I'm going to take another course  To see what  So I took another course called  Personal Values and Integrity  And when I did that  That's when I decided  To become a Scientologist  See that seems  All well and fine  You know  Because that sounds like  Things that a lot of people  Can use and utilize  In their daily lives  Yeah  When does it start  Getting controversial  When  When  How many  Like 
[01:23:30]  Courses in  Do they start telling you  About the Thetans  And things that are  Like  That's  Because that's when  They lose people  The proper word is  Thetan  Thetan  In Greek terminology  That means spirit  Right  We're all spiritual beings  The bodies are just  Mess  Matters in space and time  The physical universe  But we're all  Spiritual beings  Which  The spirit never dies  Messed  Is just like  This paper here  Like the desk  We're sitting at  That's all messed  But the spirit 
[01:24:00]  Stays  And where does it go  When we die  The spirit just  Doesn't go anywhere  It doesn't go anywhere  We just pick up  Other bodies  I ain't gonna get  Into all that  But that's what  Man I wanna get  Into your body  With all the  The women you're  Yeah I believe  In reincarnation  Yeah  Is that part of  The Scientology  Of philosophy  Of reincarnation  Yeah  It is  But I  You know  But it  It validated  My theory  Because I believe  In reincarnation  Before I heard  About Scientology 
[01:24:30]  And that just  Fortified my belief  In reincarnation  See it's totally  Cool  I don't care  You know  Whatever  Gets everybody  Through their day  You know  If they wanna sit there  And pray to a stick  Or you know  Any type of religion  You wanna  As long as it makes you  Happy  Yeah but that's bullshit  To pay to a stick  See people  People come with all  You know  When a new religion  Comes into being  You get all kind of 
[01:25:00]  Rumors about  What blah blah blah  But the thing about it  Is it's very  Very ethical  And those  That don't have  Ethics  They get pissed  And go out  And make all  Kind of lies  And do all  Kind of stuff  Like that  And people  That don't know  They believe it  That's why I say  Read it  Check it out  For yourself  Don't listen  To what Joe says  Check it out  For yourself  Do they request  A certain percentage  Of income  That's a rumor  That goes around  About Scientology too  No  Okay  No  No that's bullshit too 
[01:25:30]  And when I went  I said  I hear y'all  Take folks  I was talking shit  Like everybody else did  Then I felt like an idiot  When I found out  I wasn't like that  Yeah  Yeah  Were you guys all  Freaking though  About Tom Cruise  I mean  He kind of blew his mouth  No  No Tom was cool  Yeah  Tom was cool  Because he was  He was making things  Look a little bad  For a long time  Well see  What Tom did  Tom attacked  The world of psychology  The psychs  He saved  Just by  Getting on Oprah talking  He saved the lives  Of maybe 
[01:26:00]  400,000 kids  That were  Taking those psych drugs  You know  Yeah  But  They forced it on them  Some people think  That might work  And others say  It doesn't  But  You know  And I think  That's where  Scientology  Where people  Start going  Like  Oh brother  You know  People like Tom Cruise  Get out there  And they bash psychology  And certain  Psychotropic drugs  That work for people  If you think about that  They  Every kid  I would say  99% of the kids  That go off  And shoot their classes up 
[01:26:30]  And all this kind of shit  Like call them  They have had  Some kind of  Psychiatric influence  They have  And I could  Give you  The history of  Psychology  I mean  Psychiatry  But  All you gotta do  Is visit  Our headquarters  Of CCHR  Citizens Commission  On Human Rights  Visit them  And they'll  Give you a whole tour  And give you  The history  Of psychiatry  You know  What history of  Psychiatry I had  That kept me  From shooting up  A school 
[01:27:00]  Or cursing out  A teacher  Or something like that  It was called  The back of my  Father's hand  That drug  Worked great  It was a smack  And I didn't do it anymore  Well see  I went through that too  But  Think of those  Who did not  That the  Psychs got to them  And give them  Riddling and Prozac  And all this kind of shit  That's what  That's what  Messed them up  And  Remember the days  Of the hippies  And stuff  LSD  And all this kind of shit  Yeah  That was psych influence  They were experimenting  On us  You think that was like 
[01:27:30]  Government experiments  Well  I don't know about government  But it was psych  Wherever they had influence  And they probably had influence  In our government  The stuff came out of  Like drug companies  Yeah  Those guys  They're getting all the money  Yeah  That's where the money's going  Well I gotta give them that  The drug companies  Do really seem to be  Pushing a lot of that stuff  Out there these days  Yeah  All the commercials on TV  Anything you want  Are you saying  The drug companies  Don't have integrity  I don't buy it  He's been on Mars again 
[01:28:00]  He's been on Mars again  What do you do  You got a headache  You take an aspirin  Or something like that  No I don't  You don't  No no  You take nothing  No no no  See what I do  You shit  That's what you do  Get all that junk out of you  You take a dump  Clean yourself  That's what Opie said  That's it  Isaac  Clean yourself  Yep  You ever take a Vicodin  That shit is so good  What's that  A Vicodin  You take it  And you just go like  Is it a laxative  No  No no 
[01:28:30]  It's like a muscle relaxer  Yeah  It's one of those pills  Like Oxycontin  And all those drugs  That all the actors  Get addicted to  I don't mess with those drugs  I stay with you  No no  I don't mess with them  I know  But occasionally  You like popping one  You take pain medicine though  Right  What if you had a toothache  And it was pounded  If it's so bad  Because that's what they gave me  If it's so bad  I've had tooth surgery  I take the drugs in  If it's so bad  Yeah  But you know  I didn't get that out of me  We got a thing 
[01:29:00]  In Scientology called  You can get all that stuff  Out of you  Get out of you  Oh yes you do  We cleanse  And you get  The prescription drugs  You get the street drugs  You get insecticides  Pesticides  Radiation poison  Get all that out of you  That's right  Let me ask you a question  This is something  Like you say  When it gets so bad  You got to take something  From your pain 
[01:29:30]  So what's the difference  Between that  And say something psychological  Where for someone  Who can't do it  Any other way  Like legitimately can't  For them it's so bad  They have to take something  So I'm saying like  What's the difference  Between one or the other  Good point Jimmy  Good point  Wait now  You mean when  People have  The pain is so bad  With a threshold  For whatever it is  Like for me  It would be like  An abscessed tooth  Or whatever  You got to take  Some kind of a pain medication  So with psychology  Like you know  There are some cases  Where I'm sure  It's prescribed wrong  But what if it's legitimate 
[01:30:00]  And for them  The pain is so bad  A mental pain  That is so bad  Or a mental dysfunction  Whatever it is  Well  We call it  We call it  In psychology  We call it  I mean Scientology  We call it  Clean an engram  Engram is pictures of pain  Physical or mental  And we can erase the engram  Get all that stuff out of you  Really?  Oh yeah  And how is that done?  Like without giving away 
[01:30:30]  Any trade secrets or anything  I just want  Well it's a process called auditing  And an auditor is one who listens  Like auditorium  Auditorium nerds and stuff  That's about hearing  Not auditing like a guy  That cooked the books  So  Yeah that's the only auditor  I know  The one that tells me  I owe another 20 grand  On my taxes  Look I had that experience  But anyway  What you do  You listen to these guys  And they will find  The areas where you've had  Those engrams created 
[01:31:00]  And they erase the engrams  Get rid of them  And then you  Some people are paralyzed  But they get up and walk  Get out of you  I'm just telling you  There's some wonderful things  About that man  And it doesn't hurt you  And we have things  Called giving people assists  Assist is when  When you  When you  Experienced some pain  Or injury and stuff  Give them an assist  A nerve assist  They handle all that  It handles all of that  And I'm going to tell you what 
[01:31:30]  Remember when 9-11 happened  And all those rescue workers  Were down there  At ground zero  You know  Finding all the people  And they were inhaling  All that dust  And all that junk  Yeah  Those firemen  Were disabled  And we have a process  Tom Cruise set up  A lot of those  Things that you  Can have  Get in there  Have sweat outs  And you get in there  With a sauna  And sweat  Sweat all that junk  Out of you  And those guys  Were sweating  In their towels  They were sweating  Those towels were purple 
[01:32:00]  They were getting  All them puters  Out of those guys  And those guys  Went back to work  Had Tom not done that  They would have been  Disabled on disability  Right now  And those  Those firemen  Sing praises  To what happened  For them  So why isn't  This more  Like  Why can't people say  Look at what we've done  Here's proof  That it's been done  And because it seems  Like this should be  All over the world  Well we do  Helping  We do  But people  People choose  To follow that  Bullshit  And it's been there 
[01:32:30]  We're doing it now  But people choose  To look for the  Bad shit  Those disgruntled  Folks  That didn't have  Their ethics in  And they turn sour  And they start  Spreading all kind  Of bullshit about that  And that's the bad thing  Maybe other religions  I'm just playing  Devil's advocate  Maybe other religions  That don't like the fact  That it's picking up  A lot of members  And press  And it's  Impractical  To their beliefs  Maybe they're throwing  Out some bad press  About it  Well  Maybe they are  Maybe they are 
[01:33:00]  But we don't  Discriminate it  Against any other  Any religion  Because  Everybody wants  To better themselves  And  Cleanse themselves  And have a better life  And everybody wants  To survive  So  You can be  You can be  Whatever you want to be  But just use  The technology  Scientology  You can be  A Christian  A Baptist  You can be  A Buddhist  You can be  You can be  A Muslim  Whatever  You know  We do not  Discriminate it  But what it does  It makes you  A better  Whatever you are 
[01:33:30]  If you're Muslim  It makes you  A better Muslim  What's the one religion  You think is crazy  I don't know  Because a lot of people  Would say Scientology  So I'm wondering  What a Scientologist  Would say to that  We don't  We don't  We never  There's got to be one  Where you go  Oh man  No  Come on  We don't do that  The Nike guys  The Nike guys  Come on  We can all agree  The Nike guys  The spaceship  Was behind the comet  Yeah yeah  But they had to  Cut their genitals off  Cut their genitals off  And kill themselves  Right  In the bed  Marshall White Apple  Right  The Reverend  Yeah  The Reverend Jim Jones  There you go 
[01:34:00]  You got a cult down there  With the Kool-Aid  That's kind of  Kooky  Well  That's cult  That's the whole cult thing  Well  Watch him  I say that's unfortunate  That's what I say  See  He's very diplomatic  No no  I'm just telling the truth about it  Let's say hi to Dan in New York  Dan what's up  Nothing  Sorry to regress  On the topic  But  Is Isaac  When he like  Sleeps with these women  Do they all get pregnant  Or I mean  Is it just eight women  Oh 
[01:34:30]  Yeah  I worry about my  What's it  What's it  I was wondering  If every girl  You've slept with  Has had a kid  No  No  No  There have been a couple  Where you went  Do you believe  In the birth control  I was going to say  Yeah  I believe it doesn't  Birth control  It's for pussies  Put it out  Put it out  Would you  Would you eat a steak  Wrapped in plastic  Of course not  You wouldn't taste it  Doesn't taste good  I might  If fucking  40 other steaks 
[01:35:00]  Would show up  If I didn't  But look  When I  When I was doing  All of that  You know  I didn't  I didn't know any better  And I was living  Living that kind of life  You're 63  How old is your  Fourth wife  She's 35  There you go  Brother kind of  Riding the cradle  No but  Okay but  This is cool  Now you live  Here in the states  Yeah 
[01:35:30]  You brought her over  From Africa  Yeah  And how did she  Did she have to adjust  What did she think  About America  I brought New York first  Wow  And I mean  She was doing  Skyscrapers  And stuff  Oh yeah  But I mean  She adjusted very well  Yeah  She did  And she's cool  She found your credit card  She's doing well right  No  Let me tell you about that  It's probably just the opposite  That's what I found  Great about her  Because she didn't  Get hung up  In that material stuff  Right  And to tell you  The whole thing  When her brother  Found that I was in Ghana 
[01:36:00]  He said  You out of him  Do you know who that is  She said  I don't know  I don't care  He ran in the house  And got an LP  Is this the guy you  She said  Yeah  So  But all that stuff  Did not faze her  No  And that's what  That's what got me  Because I remember  When Eddie Murphy  Won his  Won his album  She said  Oh the Goody Goo Goo  I'm gonna find me  Somebody  Don't know how to spell  Alimony  Some zebra bitch 
[01:36:30]  Zebra riding  Goody Goo Goo  But you know  He said it  In joke  In jest  But the thing is  That my wife  Is she's not  Caught up in material stuff  That's cool  And you know  Tell you  She was studying  Two years before I met her  She was studying  To become a nun  Really  That was clean  Wow  You cleaned her off  Man  That must be some junk  You're sporting there  To get a girl  Out of the nunnery  No no no no no  No she left 
[01:37:00]  Before she met me  Oh yeah  I wouldn't do that  Wasn't like  Oh I found a new god  Isaac Hayes  Is sporting  That's quite a cock  That makes you  Walk away from eternity  That was a good one  That was a good one  Damn Jimmy  What do you got here now  Wow  Is this a recent picture of you  No I did that in 76  You did  Hey look  I can take my shirt off now

[01:50:30]  Today and tomorrow  You give the people  The information  That they need to know  When you need to know  Something  Called Opie and Anthony  They will give it to you  Like it is  Now you got a fight  Coming up  At the garden  Faith  Hope  And glory  Yes  It is a fight  That was really made  By a heavenly instance  Because  It fell apart  At champion of the world  He got sick  He got a back injury  You know the Russians  Do get a lot of back injuries  And they went  We couldn't fight  So then  WBC 
[01:51:00]  In his infinite wisdom  Appointed  Samuel Peter  The nightmare  From Nigeria  As his interim champion  And he's defending  His crown  At Madison Square Garden  Against Jameel McClein  So it's truly  A faith fight  Because  Jameel is getting  His fourth opportunity  To fight  For the heavyweight championship  I think I got  An email  From the  Nigerian nightmare  Said if I send  My bank account number  They're going to wire  Ten million dollars  Over to me  They're the best  In the world  I love those Nigerians 
[01:51:30]  Yes you know  But you know  You never can get beat  Unless you have larceny  You know  You got to have  Want something for nothing  And there is no free lunch  But they do prey on those  Who are looking  For the pie in the sky  Yeah  You know  I want something  Sound on the ground  While I'm around  You know  Opie and Anthony  Y'all  You're all decked out  Now you got  Your red white  And blue  Would you get  The bedazzler out there  And put the  The studs on there  Well you got  The first thing  You got to  Support our troops  That's the one thing 
[01:52:00]  I do  Every time  We must support  Our troops  We love them  They're the  Vanguard of our nation  The men and women  Wearing that uniform  Is the embodiment  Of America  And we can't  Forget that  So in so doing  We want to be able  To celebrate  This great nation  As the greatest nation  In the world  Called America  And I say  Only in America  And only because  We got such a great  Military  And I'm looking forward  To seeing them  Supporting them  And wishing them well  Because they put  Themselves in harm's way  For the benefit  Of Opie and Anthony  And I  And a free society 
[01:52:30]  To continue  To bring you  The best  In information  News  Music  Everything  Is happening now  Opie and Anthony  Has it for you  Don  If the troops  Are over there  Just for this show  Please come home  Immediately  Because  I think it'll be  Great once  Europe  Once somebody  Gets a little  Rambunctious over there  Probably the Germans  And just starts  A problem again  And people go  Oh help us America  Please help us  They're all high  And mighty  With their Euro 
[01:53:00]  Over there now  Feeling all good  About themselves  Not realizing  What this great  Country did  So that they  Could do  What they're doing  Now  Bad mouth us  Well Anthony  I have to agree  With you on that  Point because  Of course Don  If you were in  Paris and you  Said  Pauly Bunche  They say  Expectancy Deutsch  If the Doughboys  Hadn't to win  Over there  And change that  I mean they seem  To have forgotten that  But I think  Nikolai Sarkozy  He was a good friend  He's going to  Change it back  To what it was  Chirac was there 
[01:53:30]  But he was  Kind of anti  Jacques  Jacques  Jacques  You know what I mean  So but we  Don't do that  Jacques Strap  Yeah I'm doing  A show in Paris  On November the 10th  With John Mark  Mormac  And David Hay  From the UK  So it's going to  Be a great thing  Over there  But with Nikolai  Sarkozy  That'll be the first  On his regime  He's a good friend  Of the mayor  Of Leavenoir  Who is  Bulkarni  When you say  France  You say  Bulkarni  You know  So it's a thing  That we have  A great relationship 
[01:54:00]  Now that they're  Going to try  To change the view  You're a world traveler  Oh absolutely  And what do you like  Sort of  You're almost like  An ambassador  You know  Without portfolio  I am an ambassador  For this great nation  Called America  And as you were  Saying earlier  Many people  Don't recognize  Realize  Or appreciate  What America  Truly does  You know  What I mean  So they look  At us as  Yankee imperialists  You know  What I mean  They look  At us as  Got to be  The bully  But they got  To understand  We're fighting  For the freedom  The freedom  That they enjoy  And democracy  Is very different  And around the world  People wish 
[01:54:30]  For what we have  You know  What I mean  We're just about  That boy  We take it for granted  So we shouldn't  Do that anymore  And it's easy  For you to fly  To another country  And meet somebody  Because all you  Got to do  Is stick your head  Out the plane window  To do your hair  Oh you did a hair joke  Oh I had to do  A Don King hair joke  Oh that's why  Because he's got  The most recognizable  Hair do  Oh Don I apologize  Oh I hope  We let him roll  With it  I had to  Dude  And punt  And punt  What do I know 
[01:55:00]  Don's amazing  When We Were Kings  I think is the  Greatest documentary  I've ever seen  And to take  What you did  Was to take money  And go to Ali  Where you went to  Form it  And you got both  Signatures  And then you went  To a dictator  And got him  To put the money up  I think  How  None of those things  The rumble  In the jungle  Yes  The rumble  In the jungle  This is a fight  That I put together  I got one  That's  The ilk of that  Is coming up  In January  Here in New York  In Madison Square 
[01:55:30]  Garden also  And that's Roy Jones Jr.  And Tito Trinidad  Viva Puerto Rico  And that's going to be  One of the kind of fights  That where the fighters  Want to fight  The two icons  They don't need it  Either one  But they decided  For the public's sake  They didn't meet  When it was at the peak  Of their career  But now that their icon  Tried, true, tested  And established fighters  Legendary in nature  They're going to meet  Each other here  In a pound for pound fight  You know  That will be at  170 pounds  And catch the weight 
[01:56:00]  And it's just going to be  A tremendous evening  Of boxing  Because I liken it  To that rumble  In the jungle  With Muhammad Ali  And George Foreman  Oh he's bringing it  Back around  Yes sir  Went off road  On us there  Does it annoy you  When Foreman complains  Because Foreman complains  About the ropes  Foreman says that the ropes  Were made loose  For Ali to kind of go back  And that's something  He said in his book  He complained a little  Did you respond to that  And just say it was just  Well I don't know  You know  All I know is that  The rope-a-dope  Was created there  And Foreman punched himself out 
[01:56:30]  Whether the ropes  Was out in  Or whatever  He was swinging  And he's swinging  At Muhammad Ali  And then when he got tired  Muhammad Ali took advantage  Of that situation  But I love George Foreman  George Foreman  Is one of the greatest guys  In the world  You know he used to be  An iconoclastic  Radical type of individual  Now he's just a big  Sweet jolly brown giant  You know  Oh yeah  Selling his grills  We met him with those  Selling his grills  He's made a fortune  With those grills  And he came up  To the studio one day  And I shook his hand  And it was like 
[01:57:00]  Somebody took  A London broil  And just smacked it  Into my hand  That guy's got a set  Of mitts on him  Oh he does  He's a tremendous guy  This guy  Will always stand out  With me  He signed seven  Blank sheets of paper  I don't recommend  That to anyone  But George Foreman  Did it with me  And we had  He had a lawyer  Named Steve Bombs  And we went to  San Francisco  And filled in  All the papers  On those  On those signatures  You know what I mean  And we called him  Up and read it to him  And he lived up  To every bit of it  So George Foreman  I applaud you  You're a man's man 
[01:57:30]  You're a great guy  Great American  George Foreman  Don who's the  Greatest fighter  Of all time  Well I'd have to say  In my time  Would be  I didn't have him  But he was great  Sugar Ray Robinson  But for me  In the time  That I was involved  In it would be  Muhammad Ali  You know  Muhammad Ali  Was just a fantastic  Individual  He tried to emulate  And imitate  Ray Robinson  You know what I mean  As a heavyweight  And Ray was a middleweight  So Ali was one of  The fastest guys  Out there  With the agility  The dexterity  The lateral movement  The capability 
[01:58:00]  Of punching  Going forward  Or backward  I coin the praise  For him  You know  Every knee must bend  Every head must bow  Every tongue  Must confess  Thou art the greatest  The greatest of all times  Muhammad  Muhammad Ali  And another question  About that  Why does the world  Love Muhammad Ali  Well you know  He wasn't always loved  He was always scored  You know at first  You know me  Because  Well yeah  That's what I'm getting at  He turned all that around  And it's nothing but love  Wherever he goes now  That's the truth  But you know  Basically people stand up  You know  I think as Abraham Lincoln said  One if you're right 
[01:58:30]  Is a majority  And he was right  And so he stood there  So he had to take  The abuse  The misuse  But as he continued  To stand firm  You know  As David Henry  David Thoreau would say  You know  He came out of it  Now everybody loves him  And then he carries the torch  But he stood for something  If you don't stand for something  You don't live for nothing  I mean you've got to stand for something  That's why it makes you so dynamic  On this show  You and Anthony  Are just  You know  It's just incomparable  And it makes me feel good  To be sitting in your presence  Yeah promote us again  Come on  We want everybody 
[01:59:00]  Opie and Anthony  To be at the garden  On Saturday night  So you'll have to come on down  It's going to be a great fight  We've got six or seven countries  Now just think about this  This is a fight of faith  Hope and glory  You've got Andrew Gulotta  You know  He's coming in from Poland  Excuse me  The powerful Pole  You've got to use the nicknames there  Don  I've got to help you out here  Help me  Help me Opie  The powerful Pole Gulotta  He's taking on  The Irish kid  I was at the Irish pub yesterday  It was just so fabulous  They were all singing songs  You know the Irish 
[01:59:30]  Like to sing songs  And have their little  Little cups  You have a little nip  Every now and again  Every now and again  You know what I mean  It was just so great  And we had  We had a  A beef pie  And it was unbelievable  It was a mother's  The owner's mother's  Recipe  It was a tremendous  Deliciously  Oh  I think about it now  It was real gusto  You know what I mean  And there were chicken pot pies  And all the things  That were serving him  It was really great  Yes  And now I'm back 
[02:00:00]  You know  But anyway  We're there were Irish  And Kevin McBride  The last man to beat Tyson  He's called the Tyson Conqueror  Nickname's dying  Tyson Conqueror  Yes  You know  And he was there  So we got Ireland  Then we got Australia  With Kelly Meehan  The thunder from down under  You know  He's taking on  Devaro Williams  The Colorado kid  You know what I mean  So you got  All of these countries  Going in there  And from Australia  Ireland  A Nigerian nightmare  And where's the  Colorado kid from  Colorado  All right  Thanks  That would be great 
[02:00:30]  If he was the Nigerian  The Colorado kid  Yeah  And we need everybody  To come out there  Because this is a real  United Nations  Type of  Aggregate  Of all of this  We're trying to do  Is emulate the United Nations  And give them something  That they can do  With frivolity  And enjoy  And enjoy  And enjoy  The United Nations  Should go in there  And just start beating  The crap out of each other  Probably get more done  I'm inviting the whole  Security Council  To come down  And be our guest  Because since they fight  So well  In the UN  I think there would be  An example right there 
[02:01:00]  In Madison Square Garden  So the entire  Security Council  Is invited to the fight  Here at Madison Square Garden  While they're in session  Here at New York  At the UN  Don what do you think  I have a question  About Mike Tyson  Because it's like  There was something  About Tyson  It's like at one point  He grabbed people  In a way like  I think in a way  Ali did  Where you just thought  This guy could be  The greatest you've ever seen  I don't know how  You guys on the inside  Saw him  But the public  Has this fascination  With him  That started before  It became a train wreck  When he was like  You know  Kid Dynamite  When he was just 
[02:01:30]  Destroying everybody  What is it about Tyson  That made people  Because I got caught up  In it too  And I didn't even know  Why I love this guy so much  Well I got caught up  In it  I love Mike Tyson  I think Mike Tyson  Was one of the  One of the throwbacks  To what  You know  That form of manhood  And fighting  That you could emulate  Imitate  Or you could get in there  And when you're shaving  You know what I mean  Instead of saying  Take it off  Take it all off  You would say  You would think  That I'll knock him out  Like Tyson did  He was a knockout artist  So he had an infectious  Infectious smile 
[02:02:00]  And he could get people there  And he  Big and strong as it was  And he was talking  To the baby voice  You know what I mean  So  It was just tremendous  So he was a great gladiator  You know  He just listened to people  Talking to him  Whispering in his ears  What made him  Aberrate from the norm  And this is what  Happened to him  But you know  I have nothing but love  For Mike Tyson  A lot of respect  I'm sorry that he  Did himself in  Like he did  Because it was  What they call  Immolition  You know what I mean  And so it was a  Thing that we had to  Deal with  But hey 
[02:02:30]  I wish him well  Whatever he does  But boy was he  A terrific fighter  He had people  Coming from everywhere  To see just what  You're talking about  The excitement  Of that big punch  You know  We're talking about  Fighters here  Oscar De La Hoya  Did you see the pictures  He just smiled  We just shut up  Don Gaines  Wow  That never happened  We just figured out  I've never seen  You speak  This in my life  Oh  Anthony  Anthony  You know what I mean  And I'm just thinking  About what a great show

[02:04:30]  Throw the ball through the hoop  Isaiah  I'm telling you  It's really wonderful  Opie and Anthony  Thank you so much  Is there anybody  This is an odd question  Love being promoted  Yeah  That's Jim Norton  That's Jim Norton  Will you please give Jim Norton  The floor  Jim Norton  Please  He remembered my name  Nobody ever remembers my name  That makes me very happy  That Don King knows my name  Very famous  What's in the name  That would be called  A rose band  Any other name  Was smelly sweet  Remember the name  The immortal bard  The name was the most important  Jim Norton  Was there anybody 
[02:05:00]  You had to deal with  I'm going to guess  It might have been Mabutu  Was there anybody  You had to deal with  That really made you nervous  I mean you've dealt with  A lot of very interesting individuals  Being in the game you're in  And you went to  To Zaire  Some shady characters  You made that happen  In Zaire  I mean with a lot of their money  I mean  Was he like the most frightening guy  You ever dealt with  No on the contrary  He was very sophisticated  You know this guy  Had been educated  I guess up there  In Oxford or Cambridge  Or somewhere in England 
[02:05:30]  And he came out of the bush  You know what I mean  But he was  He was a very talented young man  And he had  Great oratory capabilities  And he was a delight  Because he loved Muhammad Ali  And he wanted to have this done  But a guy named Manduka Bula  Is the one who really  Was the interceder between us  And he would work with us  And tell us how to work  With Mobutu Sese Seko  His name was  Joseph Desiree Mobutu  And he was from the Belgian Congo  So he wanted to take his country back 
[02:06:00]  Crying out for freedom  Just like we do  Or everyone else is  And so he had to organize  All of these Nigerians  Not giant  I mean Zawarins  Or whatever they are  They were  So he had to be able  To talk to them  And get them together  And he did  Then he went back  To the native  Joseph  He dropped the name  Of Joseph Desiree Mobutu  And took on Mobutu Sese Seko  You know what I mean  So then everybody  Had to do  The indigenous names  That had to speak their language  He gave them a sense  Of pride and dignity  That was hitherto for 
[02:06:30]  Not done  Not done over there  Is it true that he actually  The story of  When we were kings  That he rounded up  All the criminals  To make Zairee safe  And was like  When he was randomly  Having prisoners killed  To let you know  That you're connected  I mean was that true  Or is that just the stuff  Well I don't know  But he did  You know  We had a crime dropping  I mean  What they call a crime rate  Yeah  It dropped precipitous  Okay well  You know what I mean  So everybody was good man  Everybody was safe  You know what I mean  Because he wanted the news  To go out  That Zairee was it 
[02:07:00]  You know what I mean  Yeah that's a great movie  And we had a movie  We had a reporter  Her name was  Chimpupu  Wah Chimpupu  And he would do  All kind of stuff man  You know what I mean  Chimpupu  Wah Chimpupu  He would you know  Censor the press  He would send guys  He sent them over  To Iceland somewhere  On the way  Coming into the  To Zairee  But he was a good guy  You know what I mean  But he just didn't understand  That you don't censor  You know  You do things  Straight out  And report the news  But just again  It shows the example  Of how great the America is 
[02:07:30]  Right on  Damn  Support our troops  Support our reputation  I've been with some  Interesting people  You've had people  Accusing you of some  Very unsavory things  In boxing  Absolutely  And I can tell  Just by listening to you  And watching you  You never are going to  Out talk Don King  On a point  It's just not going to happen  You're amazing  But they're always  Accusing you of  Stealing from boxers  And hurting boxers  What is your typical  Response to that  Well you know what  You know  They've got to always  Understand that  You have to do  Like Jesus  And he says  He would out  See and let him  Cast the first stone  Judge not yet 
[02:08:00]  You be judge  You know  You know what I mean  So in Matthew 7  12 it says  Do unto others  As you would have  Them to do unto you  You know  Whenever you're good  At whatever you do  You're always going  To be accused  Of how you go up  Those who are  Standing on the line  And did nothing  They don't want  To get into the game  They don't want to  Get into the chance  Of losing  They'll go against  The chance of winning  They don't want  To take risks  That's what I'm  Trying to say  So what if you  Take risks  And you succeed  Then you're going  To have people  That's going to be  Jealous  You know what I mean  And I think  It was Shakespeare 
[02:08:30]  That said  Tripos light as air  Are to the jealous  Confirmation as strong  As holy writ  You know what I mean  So you've got to  Understand that  Whatever they say  I'm still standing  You know what I mean  Now you've got to  Understand  That's the bottom line  Anthony and Opie  Listen  The CIA  The IRS  Interpol  You know what I mean  The FBI  The Polish departments  Do you know  With all the accusations  That they have made  Against me  The allegations  That they have made  Against me  You know  That if any of them  Were true  I wouldn't be sitting 
[02:09:00]  Here on  Ninety two three  You know what I mean  I'd be busting rocks  In that thing there  So you've got to  Take it  Take it like it is  You can't have it  You've got to  Take the bitter  With the sweet  You know  I love the life I live  And I live the life I love  You've got to say  Say what you mean  And mean what you say  The paths of the righteous man  That's right  By sect on all sides  Hallelujah  Talk to him  So you haven't seen  The Oscar De La Hoya pictures  And you've never fixed a fight  Never  That's what you're saying today  Right  I can't say  That I haven't seen 
[02:09:30]  Some photographs  All right  Because Oscar's always been  Fighting for me  Yeah  But fix the fight  Never  You know what I mean  Because you don't get  No chance on that at all  You know what I mean  They would love to catch me  Doing anything  I'm accused of the  Johnstown flood  The World War II  You know what I mean  The Lindbergh kidnapping  You know what I mean  The Brink's job  Whatever it is  That they can find  They will label it on me  So I have a Pope-like quality  Of absolving that  Now years ago though  You were accused  I even think convicted 
[02:10:00]  Of manslaughter  Yes I was  You know what I mean  Unfortunately  It was the frustrations  Of the ghetto  Expressing themselves  And I happened to get  The misfortune of being  Instrumental in the  Fatality of a fellow  Human being  I think that is something  I've suffered deep  Contrition for  And to expiate for your sins  You've got to keep giving  You've got to keep working  You know if you have faith  You can cast your bread  Upon the water  And you'll get back cash  Does that still bother you  Like as a person  If you don't have faith  You get back soggy bread  On a daily basis though 
[02:10:30]  Does that bother you  It doesn't bother me  As much as  You know  Once you recognize  And appreciate the fact  That you know  That you're not God  And you know  You could be God-like  In dealing with people  You've got to be able  To deal with what is real  And then you've got  To justify it  In an irrational  Rational  Whichever way you want  To put it  When you didn't start it  Or whatever it is  But you know  It's a thought Anthony  You know what I mean  You can never just really  Wash it away  You have to go out  And try to do good  For others  You know what I mean  But contributing 
[02:11:00]  And giving  Make up for it  In other ways  Hey how did  But to get serious  For a second  How did it feel  To kill a man  Well you know what  It's not a feeling  Of what you're going  To do for a killer  Just like when you say  On Iwo Jima  How would you tell  The guys over there  With the tan  Corregidor  You know what I mean  When you find people  That are fighting  You know  It's the way that you  Look at life  And what you is  Because it's three words  Eros  Filia and agape  That's the Greek words  Eros is an affectionate love  You know  Filia is like a brotherly love 
[02:11:30]  You know what I mean  A family love  Whatever  And agape is the love  Of the human personality  I may love you  Because you're a human being  But I may not like your ways  Your ways may be disdain  It may be something  That will be not appropriate  You know what I mean  But you still got to be respected  For being a human personality  And so I think that  I love all the people  You know what I mean  And it's what John Donne said  Many years ago  That no man's an island  In time to himself  Every man is a member  Of the continent  And a part of the main  So therefore  Do not sin for whom  The bell tolls 
[02:12:00]  The bell tolls for thee  You know what I mean  Yes you know what I mean  So I got to believe in John  He said every man's death  Diminishes me  I'm involved with mankind  So it felt good  You were 13 years  Oh B baby  Yeah  Oh B  Go Jim go  Damn  Damn  This is  I don't want to be  Your third kill  We're alright right  You're alright man  The first time  Oh ye of little faith  Get thee behind me Satan  A guy tried to rob 
[02:12:30]  One of your places  And it was ruled  To justify our Bahamas  You were defending  Yes  Your place of business  Yes  And I think  That's one thing  Is the reputation  Has gotten out  Don King doesn't play  Yeah  Don King  Don't screw around  With Don King  Just deal with him  In a certain way  And you'll be fine  Don't  Could get ugly  Well you know  You got to think  About John Paul Jones  And I think about him  Quite often  When his John Paul Jones  His ship was sinking  And the water  Was over the portholes  And the British commander  Yell out to John Paul Jones  Do you surrender  Do you surrender  And John Paul Jones 
[02:13:00]  Retorted  I have not yet  Began to fight  You know what I mean  So you got to keep  Fighting for this great nation  Called America  And that's what I do  You know what I mean  Because this is the greatest  Country in the world  Regardless to the many  Iniquities and injustices  That we have to suffer  And there are many  You know what I mean  But the fact of the matter  Is you must challenge America  To be  To rise up to what it could be  One land  Indivisible  With liberty and justice  For all  We hold these truths  To be self-evident  That all men  Are created equal  Endowed by their creator  With certain inalienable rights  Unless they steal from you  Among these which are life  And if this is happening 
[02:13:30]  Well the thief  Got to live too  You got to understand  You know what I mean  Not just according  What he's stealing for  Is he stealing to feed his family  Or is he just stealing  To take Opie's money  You know what I mean  It's a different thing  You know Opie has so much  He should share it  I couldn't agree more  Yes  All right Doug  That's what we've been saying  For years Don  Not as a square garden  We got to take a break here  Saturday night  Let's hear the great Don King  Don't touch that dog  Because we'll be right back  End with Opie and Anthony  And Don take us to break  By doing a promo  For the Opie and Anthony show  And the great Jim Norton  Please  Oh yes

[02:21:00]  Written the way it was  There was nothing  Much for me to add  So I knew I wanted  To just make him  Sound like a Baltimorean  I didn't want him  To sound like a kid  From Brooklyn  Uh I knew I didn't  Want him to look like  A kid from New York  Dressing like that  I immediately  I immediately saw that  Um Baltimore got  Their own swagger  So I just  I would spend hours  In the street  And just listen  And watch the  The comings  And the goings  I got to watch  You know um  Girl go in  In the morning  And boy come out  For those who don't know  That's crack and dope 
[02:21:30]  You know  Crack goes in  In the morning  Dope comes out  I swear to god  I thought it was  Some kind of a  Tranny reference  Of course you did  I swear to god  You were hoping  Boy or girl  Yeah  Coke and dope  Really  I would watch the streets  I would watch the streets  I would listen  I would sit in  The Lexington Market  For hours  And just listen  To dialects  And people's tones  And um you know  With the help of  David and Ed  And the directors  They brought out  Just kind of  Came together  And I took  I went to the  Shooting gallery  Which is the roof

[02:22:30]  So you must have  Loved the scene  In season  Three  When Omar and  Brother Muzon  Had that little  Gun conversation  I'm not up to  Season three  Oh  Yeah I know  I was the last  Congress  I'm the last one  To uh  Get into uh  The wire  But like you know  In this day and age  I like doing  The 48 hour film festival  Where you sit there  And just keep  Putting DVDs  That's the way to do it  Oh man  No commercials  Nothing  You're sitting there  Your eyes are red  Drinking a beer  To go containers  Everywhere  One more  And then you're like  Just one more episode 
[02:23:00]  Man  It's like  I'm definitely  Going to sleep  After this one  And then they end it  In a way where it's like  Well fuck  Now I gotta watch  At least the beginning of it  And then before you know it  It's over  You start out watching it  You're fully clothed  But then you just have  One sock half on  Half on  Please  Tipping off the tip  To your toes  I tell people  Like who just now  When people  I meet people in the street  They're like  Yo I just bought  The whole five seasons  And we're gonna watch it  I'm like okay  You have to get  Some survival tactics  You need water  You need food  You need something  By the couch  Because your bucket 
[02:23:30]  To release yourself  Yeah you'll just sit there  Because you are not moving  So just understand that  Donuts water  And something to sit on  And shit at the same time  And that scene by the way  In season three  With Brother Muzon  Is a great scene  Because you shot him  In a great moment  Where you call 911 for him  After you shot him  It's just  And they're discussing  Their weapons  Just these two guys  Who are probably gonna  Shoot each other  Discussing their weapons  So great  You would love that  Fantastic  It's such a  Everyone I've turned on  To the show  Fucking goes out of 
[02:24:00]  Their mind for the show  They're like  Why was this not  Higher publicized  Because the critics  Loved it  But never nominated  I've mentioned that  Many times  Which is  Sickening  House  All these fucking  Dumb shows  That are nominated  House  House  The doctor  Once again  He's gotta find out  Why a child  Is bleeding from the ass  On an all new house  Alright we get it  He handles weird cases  You know  So you were saying 
[02:24:30]  You grew up in Brooklyn  Yeah  Flatbush  So now  Alright  I lived in Brooklyn  For a while  I kind of steered clear  Of Flatbush  Smart man  Now  Did you get out of there  Obviously  You know  You're an actor  You're doing very well  It seems like  You would have gotten  Out of there  Kind of young  Or  I just can't seem  To get out the hood  For some reason  No  I don't even know  If I really  Want to get out the hood  I kind of like the hood  I'm in Newark right now  Where they got bodies  Dropping all around 
[02:25:00]  Hey the garden spot  Of the garden state  Yeah man  I got the old four  Young girls  Got murdered around  The corner from me  So  I was just watching  A show called  Jack last night  Which is on  Jack  Yeah  Yeah  And it's  It's this squad  That goes around  Jersey  And they were in Newark  During the episodes  I was watching  And they just  Put in plate numbers  Of cars  And just  By luck  They find stolen cars  All the time  People driving around  And that's all they do  All night  Newark seems to be  We're up to hook right now  Yeah yeah  They're just stealing cars  Like crazy over there  Cars 
[02:25:30]  Lives  Yeah  It's just insane  Now what's the  Attraction  To being in that  Atmosphere  When  You know  You're obviously  Doing very well  I like you  I like you  We're going to hang out  But  I mean  You know  Saying  It's affordable  For number one  And my family's there  You know  I still go back  To my hood  In Brooklyn  I still have family  Out there  And you know  We chill  I go visit my aunts  And you know  My god kids  Yeah  Yeah my god kids  He said yeah

[02:26:30]  And it's a little odd  When you meet people  And it's like  No I don't act like that  All the time  I'm not  I'm not like that  All the time  I'm not drunk off my face  All the time  No that I am  Yeah  You mean sober  I don't act like that  All the time  Yeah there you go  There was  It's so hard  I know as an artist  You want to move on  And you want to do  Like all these other projects  And you want to be  But it's like  I just want to fucking  I'm like a five year old  I just want to fucking  Say Omar things  All I want to do  Is say what up bird  That's all I want to say 
[02:27:00]  Probably one of the best  For anyone that hasn't seen it  He's falsely testifying  Against the guy  To get him thrown away  For a murder  Because the guy  Is a piece of shit  I mean bird's a piece of shit  But he wants bird  And he and bird  Both know he's lying  Through his teeth  And they say  Do you see the defendant  In court  And he looks at the guy  Who he's lying about  He goes yo what up bird  And he just wants to  Fucking cut your throat  It's such a great moment  What up bird  That was one of my favorites  By the way  The court scene  Was definitely one of my favorites  That's from season two 
[02:27:30]  But um  Like in the beginning  I remember people  Started coming to me like  Yo Omar the snake  Was that season two  Or season one  That's season two  The courtroom scene  Was season two  With bird  Yeah with bird  When we're in the courtroom  And he's testifying  I think that's season one  Looked at you  Arguing with the guy  That was in it  He's in it  Shut up Jimmy  I love this story  Fanboy  No no he's in it  But I've watched it more  I believe you too  He doesn't watch it  And go Omar  He just goes  Oh it's me again  Let me fast forward  Fucking uh  Wasn't that  That was for the 
[02:28:00]  Oh you know what  He's probably right  That was for the  The civilian murder  In the project  Yeah when the working man  Got worded right  The courtroom scene  Didn't happen until season two  Oh  Yeah  Alright  I'll stand  Jimmy  Look I'll stand corrected  Since the guy who did it  I really should have  My fucking teeth kicked in  Don't feel bad  I made so much money  Last year  On people betting  Whether that was  Michael that killed Bodie  Oh really  I made so much money  Off of that  Side betting  You know you could win  A lot of money off  Of people asking  What season of 
[02:28:30]  Lucky Louie  It was  I love  They got a laugh  From the people  Oh you know Lucky Louie  Man I got starstruck again  He came to the premiere  Of uh  Jesus  Not you  Him  Lucky Louie  I love Lucky Louie  I know he knows Louie  I didn't miss an episode  Did you recognize him  When I came in  From Lucky Louie  You  Oh my god  Oh shit  Holy shit  I'm laughing  But this is pissing me off  To no end  Yo you the neighbor 
[02:29:00]  The crazy fucking neighbor  I love you  You and the fucking  Oh does this piss me off  The janitor  Walking around naked  All the time  Oh yeah Rick Shapiro  Come in  Someone check  You got me cursing man  Dude no  You don't know how much  This pisses me off  Cause I hate when he  Really likes an actor  And they come in  And know the motherfucker  I hate it  Lucky Louie  Dude I watch that shit  Every time  Every time  I made the joke  To goof on him  Cause I was  Backfire  I was  I'm thinner now  Fuck shut up  That's probably why  He didn't recognize me 
[02:29:30]  A man walks in in shape  It's kind of hard to see  That face  What's his shape  All right  Ask sensei  Ask sensei  When you was coming  Down the hallway  I said  I know that face  I swear to my god  I was telling sensei that  Damn  Oh in the hallway  Damn it  That makes me very happy  I'm sure it does  It makes me miserable  It made me mad  He took it off the air  No no no  I'm not gonna cry  But another guy from the wire  Who was actually a fan  Of Lucky Louie  Was fucking Method Man  I think me and Meth  Had some conversations  About Lucky Louie  Yeah  We talked about that  We talked about your show 
[02:30:00]  On the set  I had  We had lines  From your show  We'd bring it on  And we'd laugh  There was something  You know  I smoked a lot of sauce  I saw a pot  I'm afraid  So it was a fry  But there was  We had a few  One liners  On that show  That we would just  We started running them  Man I had skits  From Lucky Louie  Did you see  What was happening  He was like  This this and that  Oh that makes me  So fucking happy  How'd you like his acting  Was his acting good  Man that whole show  Was incredible man  That was real life  Comedy  Very Honeymooners-ish  Yeah exactly  Like you know 
[02:30:30]  The X rated version  Of Honeymooners  Yeah yeah  Yeah R rated  And Louie never  Sweetened any of the laughs  Because every comedy  Sweetens them  They all balance the laughs  And they put in  These little laugh tracks  To even it out  And he never won  People would complain  Some of the critics  That the laughs  Are too loud  Because these little  Fucking pussies  They're used to  These sitcom laughs  That get evened out  Louie didn't do that  No you had real people  That needed laughing  Yeah  That's what you needed  In the wire  Our little laugh track  Imagine that horrible  Some horrible shit 
[02:31:00]  Going down  And just  Awful laugh track  Like the old  MASH laugh  Where there's that  One guy trailing off  They actually did  The only laugh track  In MASH?  Oh boy did they  Yeah  In the first season  It was awful  They did an episode  It was awful  Clinger  Clinger probably had  All the one liners  Oh yeah  I think they did one episode  Without a laugh track  And people complained  Well as time went on  They removed it  Because it just seemed  The storyline  It just didn't go  The storyline was getting darker  It didn't exist  Yeah that's true  It was more the anti-war thing 
[02:31:30]  Going on  And I just  That there's a laugh track  In Hogan's Heroes  You know  When you got a POW  At Nazi POW camp  Oh yeah  Oh that's great  Look here comes  General Bull Carter  Oh he's gonna come in  And more prisoners  Are coming in  This is fantastic  Swastikas on the wall  Remember that shit  I used to love that show  I'd love to  I know  I'd love to know  Who pitched that though  Because you know  They're pitching it 
[02:32:00]  To Hollywood producers  Probably Jewish guys  Probably  And they walk up  And it's like  I got a great idea  It's a comedy  Based in a Nazi POW camp  Go  Green lighting  Green light  It's gonna be huge  Well they probably said  We won't do that  It'll make money  Okay  Okay  Never forget  Plus the Nazis  That it's on  Thursday nights at 9  A rumor that he got  He got you  Oh yeah  The head  Hogan  Yeah  Yeah yeah  Well he was into  Some really kinky 
[02:32:30]  Fucking  Group sex stuff  And videotaping it  In the early days  Of video  Yeah  He was videotaping stuff  And then there was a rumor  That he had  Had sex with some guy's wife  Yep  And that he  Bashed his head in  He got his head  Bashed in with a tripod  Yeah  With a fucking camera tripod  Wham  Bob  Caved his head  Bob Crane  Bob Crane  Yeah  Yeah  With his fucking  I hate to keep doing  Penis references  He's a dirty boy  But apparently  Bob Crane was packing like 10  You've had a nice one  And he gave it to a lot  Of different girls  And some husband probably 
[02:33:00]  His son came in  To promote something  A few years ago  Remember that  They should release those films  Because he videotaped himself  Just fucking  Bob Crane fucking  Just call it that  Bob Crane fucking  Yeah  Fucking Bob Crane  Fucking Bob Crane  Bob fucking Crane  You get all three domain names  So no  You're fucking stealing  How many columns  You just hear  My kind of hero  Hogan  Hogan  Yeah his helmet  Look like fucking  Schultzes  Hendrix  There's a fucking  Videotape of Hendrix  Yeah  Of fucking 
[02:33:30]  I almost went in a porn store  And bought  I think Red Light District  Who gets all that stuff  How long has that been out though  I don't know  It's just odd  That things have come out  Like it's very hard  To keep anything secret  Anymore  Especially things  Films  Pictures  Things that have been  Buried in secrecy  For years  Coming out  Now with YouTube  And stuff like that  Yeah  It's out there  You know  See I guess  What I'm saying is  Watch what you're saying  What you do on film people  How about just do nothing on film  You know what  The only thing I've ever done  Is set up a video camera  With a TV 
[02:34:00]  And no videotape in there  So you can kind of monitor  What you're doing  Yeah  So there's no videotape  You're just kind of looking  And then you just feel silly  Yeah  You just look and go  What is that  Oh my god  No that's me from the back  You feel safe  You feel silly and safe  Yeah yeah  Because there's no record of it  Yeah exactly  The first time I ever got a video camera  I actually recorded myself jerking off  Because I wanted to see  What I looked like  Why would you do that  And then I taped over  A couple of my sets with it  Why wouldn't you just burn the tape  See that's how it happened  There was one second  Of me jerking off  Yeah of course 
[02:34:30]  I had a bunch of people  Over my house  Watching this tape  And then there's just one second  Of  And the angle was from  In between my legs  So you saw my grey nuts  And just me like this  Oh shit  For one second  And it was just like  What the fuck was that  It doesn't butt up  Against each other  And then Wild Kingdom  Showed interest  You showed him the coffee table  Huh  Yeah  Would you have a grey sack  Like a pig  What  I called it  I called it the coffee table  The coffee table  There was an episode  I watched this show 
[02:35:00]  On Showtime  Called Weeds  So one time  The two  The brother  And the neighbor  The brother  And the councilman  Was talking  And they were discussing  What is the part  Between the asshole  And the nuts  What do you call that  Right  So they were like  So the maid walks in  They go  What do you call  The space between  The asshole  And the nuts  She goes  The coffee table  Because that's where  They were sitting  In between  Oh shit  That's a funny  Fucking line  I called it  The coffee table  You were showing  Your coffee table 
[02:35:30]  That is fucking beautiful  What a great  Improv line that is  Man  It's classic  And we were talking  I mean there's  Again for Wire fans  We were talking  Mike and I were talking  Off air  You know  As two men  From HBO will do  Just discuss things  Off air  Of course  I was on HBO  Too stupid  At the same time  You were  Doing what  But you weren't  Talking about it  With us  Did you ever see  Torgasm  Dane Cook's Torgasm  I was getting ready  To say  You let the dude  From Dane  Dane Cook's Torgasm  I swear to god  Holy shit  No hugs 
[02:36:00]  Now Bobby  He didn't want  To hug you  He didn't want  To hug you  He did  Okay America  It's official  We HBO family  We jerk each other off  And we watch  Each other's work  Go take a break  Look I gave a bow  During Jimmy's performance  On HBO  I stood up  And went like this  That is true  I shot a special  And him and Opie  Who's not here today  Because he's sick  Came to  And I acknowledged him  In the audience  And Anthony stood up  And did  I'm on the radio  The fuck do I know 
[02:36:30]  I'm not on HBO  That's a real family vibe  That we support  To the show  You know it's the first time  We meet  But I've watched  Both you guys  So it was like  Really  That's hysterical  I watched yours more  Than yours  Pointing to Norton  And then to Kelly  Make sure you clear that up  Did you say something  I did too  Hey Michael  I want to talk about  The Spike Lee movie  You're in  Yes sir  Yeah  How is that working  With Spike  Some people say  He's a breeze  To work with  Others  Not so much  Well I'm on the breezy side  Oh yeah  Yeah  You know 
[02:37:00]  He does  He didn't  I didn't have to audition  He wrote the character in  And he had me  You know  Wow  Flew me in  On his private lair  And you know  And had me  Land on top of the hotel  Now I'm just  Yeah right  He did write me in  And I did not  He did make me  The offer for the character  He was  Was that because of  The Wire  Yeah  The Wire  The Wire  You know  And you know  It's just  I had a great time  Working with him  I think he caught me  I was with him  Like three weeks  Out there in Tuscany  I think he caught me  Michael  Maybe 
[02:37:30]  Like  None  He caught me  Omar  Oh shit  And whenever he saw me  Whenever I was at  Whether it be the restaurant  Or when I first got to work  When the set  Anything  Whenever he first saw me  For that day  Omar coming  Omar coming  Omar coming  And it was like  Spike  Killing me  He's phenomenal  He's real quick  He has  He knows direct  He knows what he wants  And like  I like to call him  The method director  Because this dude  Is just really  He's really 
[02:38:00]  He's a genius  With just creating scenarios  And these scenarios  And putting you in it  To live in it  Even when you're not  On the set  Like  We would do boot camp  You know  He put us up  In this really high mountain  Where like  Your ears would pop  In Tuscany  And you know  You had like  Wild stallions  Running around  It was  You know  The boot camp  Was like  Like really rough conditions  Weather wise  But I had  It was nowhere near  As extreme  What those actual  Soldiers went through  When it was going down  But we had  We got to  Get a taste of that  We shot in the actual 
[02:38:30]  Space where the massacre  Happened  Which is the  Surgical river  In Tuscany  So it was like  A lot of history  You could feel  The eeriness  Wait was that  Was that a true story  I didn't know  If it was a true story  Oh yeah  True story  Okay it was  Well I mean  I don't mean  Not about the miracle  With the whole head thing  Yeah  But I mean  Like  The war  I learned  I learned this  Just as I go  So if I sound smart  You know  It's by course  But um  Apparently  In World War II  When Hitler was  Trying to take over  The world  My pinky  Having his pinky 
[02:39:00]  In the brain moment  He was next to  Go on to Italy  And it's part of  This region  It's called Tuscany  And um  And this was the  First time  That I believe  Patton  General Patton  He said  Yeah  Get them niggas  Some guns  They want to fight  Let's fight  And um  He gave  Blacks first time  Guns  But it was like  Minimal  You know  We had  Muskets  Yeah  The bare  Minimals  And um  We went out there  And in this river  We got massacred  And um  It was um  Wow  And it was because 
[02:39:30]  And they got massacred  And there was uh  He was calling in  And saying  This is where we are  Bomb the position  And the white  Commander  Didn't believe  That they had actually  Advanced across the river  And was bombing behind them  Like a fucking dope  And not hitting the enemy  So that's why  They're stuck here  And they wind up  In this little  Italian village  And there's one guy  He taps into  Every fear a man has  Who was the guy  Bishop  A guy  With a  Real slick dude  Who just wanted to  Fuck the Italian women 
[02:40:00]  And the one guy  Is falling in love  With the Italian girl  And uh  And then Bishop  Just keeps going over  And he's pretty much  Talking about how  Black Americans have  Huge dicks  You know he's trying  To hint that  To the little  Dumb guinea broad  And uh  There's a scene  Where  Do you know  Your great  Great  Great  Great  Grandpa  And walking  So angry  He licks his lips  And he mouths  He can't get the gun  Faster  That was hysterical  It was a true romance  It was a fucking  Spike Lee's actually  Very funny too 
[02:40:30]  He's the kind of  Fucking  He's got great  Comic timing  When he's in his own  Films and he does  Funny shit man  I love Spike  Man he's a genius  Was he in the movie  At all  No not in this one  I haven't seen it  Not in this one  Yeah  I don't think he's  Put his stuff  In one of his  Kind of takes you  Out of a period piece  Since X  He hasn't been  In one of his  Projects  In one of his  Joints since X  Yeah  Yeah  He should be  He's always funny  It's like a Hitchcock  Thing  Maybe he got  Compared to Hitchcock  Too much  He didn't like it  Because he would  Always  I'm really  Talking quickly  I drank a lot  Of caffeine today  Wow you are 
[02:41:00]  Wow you are going  What are you  Boy or girl  What is that  That's a girl  That's a girl  Girls up  Boys down  I've made that  Mistake  As we all  Are well aware  But we were talking  You know what  Hey look  Some of them  Sometimes  It's like  Fry high day  What the hell  Some of them  Are so passable  The Asians are too  But when you get  To the Spanish  Oh forget about it  You got to touch  The Adams apple  That's right  If they have one  You hand them the money

[02:49:30]  Into the show  Either play it on video  Or play it on audio  And just cringe  Like what the fuck  Was I thinking back then  As far as my acting career  There was nothing  That I would cringe at  Now  I had another profession  Before I started acting  Which was dancing  Okay  That could be a cringe  Moment there  Yeah  There's somewhere  On God's Green Earth  There was footage of me  In hammer pants  And a belly shirt  Hammer pants  And a belly shirt  What's a belly shirt  It's a little half shirt  Right  It's every shirt 
[02:50:00]  You wear  Girls call them tip tops  Girls call them tip tops  But I can't go here  So it was a  Belly shirt  I got some cringe moments  As a dancer  Wow  I mean  If my mentor  Tupac Shakur  Could be on a stage  With Digital Underground  With some Speedos on  Humping a fucking  Blow Up doll  I could be in  Some hammer pants  And a belly shirt  Wait was he in that video  That was live footage  If you watched  The Thug Angel  There was some footage 
[02:50:30]  When he first  His first gig  With the road  He got a roadie  He was a roadie  For Digital Underground  Oh wow  And then he bumped up  To like background dancer  Like a Scott  To be part of the stage show  And they would get in  These like really colorful  Speedos  Type thing  Underwear  And hump  Hump  Hump on  On blow up dolls  On the stage  So when I saw that  I was like  You know what  We all gotta pass  And we all come  From somewhere  Damn it  Yeah  Yeah  You ain't born  As sexy as you is  You gotta get

[02:54:30]  Get ready for a surprise  Listen  Just remember  I got a belly shut on somewhere  And hammer pants  And hammer pants  It don't get no worse than that  But I had hammer pants on too  In my first head shot  Because I started comedy in 1990  Should have a hammer over your head  I was believing  It would bounce right off  A fucking  The claw end  Fucking  Buried in my coffee table  There's a photo of me  With hammer pants  I used to wear those  Workout pants  I didn't wear the belly shirt  But I thought that was  Like a really cool hip look

[03:02:30]  Fast cars  And pretty women  Beat you up all the time  We were just talking  About your  The thriller in Manila  We didn't know  You were coming  This show  Oh yeah  We got a copy of it  We watched it last night  And we've been talking  About it for the last  Half hour  It's an amazing  Amazing film  Yeah  Guys did a good job  On it man  It's amazing  How many  I didn't know  That there was so much  Real animosity  Between you guys  And when you watch this  You get a really ugly  View of Muhammad Ali 
[03:03:00]  You showed a really  Ugly side of Ali  That was eye opening  He always been like  Let's say  Rookie  Rookie  That's a new word  He always been rookie man  Like you know  People that helped him  He forgot  You know  He don't have no  Nothing nice to say  To him  Like all the guys  That he fought  Over the years  You know  They call him  Bear  Gorilla  Well I think  I was a gorilla  I act my part 
[03:03:30]  Bear  Gorilla  You know  Ugly  And like  You know  He was light bright  Damn near white  Well Joe  He came out afterwards  Light bright  Damn near white  He came out afterwards  In the New York Times  And said  That was just to promote  The fight  But do you think  That's bullshit  Do you think  That went way beyond  Promoting the fight  I got a few more words  There  Beside of bullshit  There's a lot more  Behind it  Because you know  Like  I think the guy 
[03:04:00]  Was more nervous  With some of the  Opponents  You know  I mean  That he didn't  Really show  What he was going to  Try to crank him up  To get them wild  Or get them to say  Different things  To make them nervous  That they don't want  To fight him  You know  I mean  That's the way it was  So he talked  The more he talked  The harder I trained  Oh yeah  Yeah  I asked him  When the bell rang  I hope you got to lunch  Well yeah  He ain't gonna have  No bricks in between 
[03:04:30]  Would it frustrate you  I'm sorry  Would it frustrate you  Because he was taunting  Foreman in Zaire  Would it frustrate you  In those moments  When he was holding your head  And trying that  Psychological game on you  Or would it not bother you  Yeah  He mugged me  On the second fight  All night long  Mugged you  Mugged me  Like he didn't want  To kiss me  I didn't want  To kiss me  We were there  To fight  Not to hug  And to kiss each other  You know what I mean  Yeah for the people  That don't know  There were three fights  The first one  Frazier won  No I won all three of them  I think so 
[03:05:00]  I think so  I'm sorry  But stop being right there  I won all three of them  You know what I mean  You can look at him now  We had three fights  You know  I'm walking  I'm talking  You know what I mean  He ain't nothing  But a hound dog  Working all the time  So I'm like  I'm enjoying life  You're enjoying life  And Ali is  Pretty much in his own  Little prison there  So that's what you mean  By you winning  All three fights 
[03:05:30]  And the main thing  About it  Was it wasn't you  And I  You know what I mean  You gotta look back  At the things he said  That's time  And by you know  Like I'm not making  Anything up  I am the greatest  I am the prettiest  I am the fastest  You see  Now you can't be no the  Yeah  Me you can be the  But we can't be the  Yeah  That's the up there  And he tried to warn him  To have the action  To back off  And that the  He never  He never did  What the Lord asked him to do 
[03:06:00]  So that way  You think he's being punished  For his arrogance in a way  Like or  Or his  His complete arrogance  You're saying  Like  Well I  I didn't think  That the arrogant part  Of him being like that  The good man  You and I  Can't be the  Because we don't use  That word the  Me you ain't use  The  You know  She been a head off  The is the man of staff  You know what I'm saying  And he said  I am the greatest  I am the prettiest  I am the fastest  The good man came in 
[03:06:30]  And took over  Well Jimmy let's start with this  Now Joe  You and Ali were friends  And you  Oh yeah  Well now we wasn't  The friends like  Like me you can go out  And have a good time  But you guys looked out  For each other  We were friends  To get the job done  Yeah  And when Ali was out  Of the fight game  You were there for him  And you were helping him out  And you gave him  A little loan  And you  You were  You pretty much got him  Back into the  The fight game  I'm the man  Who went to the White House  To ask the president  To give him a license 
[03:07:00]  You talked to Nixon  That's right  I asked the president  To give him a license  He's on film  So I ain't not  No lying about it  I ain't not bragging about it  But he asked me  To go and talk to him  I went and talked to the president  To give him a license  And it worked  And it worked  He gave him  Joe  You think he got  I got it in my back pocket  President  But you also gave Ali money  Because he was down  On his luck  How much money was it  I need to know  I don't know  About $500  No big money  Okay  You know what I mean  Back in them days  It was big money  But you know  I never got it back 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  Yeah  So but  Along to some guys  Like that  It's no problem  You know what I mean  Joe  Had you fought  Had you guys fought once by then  By the time Ali  Left boxing  Or was asked to leave boxing  Because of Vietnam  You had fought once or twice by then  None  No  Oh you hadn't fought at all  No none  The war  You didn't  Oh that's right  Your first fight was 71  That's right  That's right  He started fighting Ali  After Ali came back  Matter of fact 
[03:08:00]  The war stopped for an hour  Of the fight  How do you like that  Vietnam  Two athletes stopped the war  Now if you can do that kind of work  You are  He should be able to go over  And talk to them  And get their marbles together  You know what I mean  But that boy  He probably  Yeah  He probably didn't have that kind of pull  Like you thought he did  You know what I mean  I learned a lot from this movie  The one thing that was amazing to me  How Ali  Made it sound like 
[03:08:30]  If you rooted for Joe Frazier  You were  You know  You were against the black man  And Ali was all about  You know  If you root for me  You're rooting for the black man  And what's strange about that  Is like  How you were brought up  Where you live to this day  You know  You live in a pretty rough neighborhood  In Philly to this day  The neighborhood  Is the best neighborhood in the world  You know  Wherever you carry yourself man  Well  You can walk in  Can I walk through there? 
[03:09:00]  Sure  No problem  Nobody don't bother you  You ain't bothering nobody  But if you go around  Shaking somebody's feather  A leaf  You're going to get rain on  You heard that?  But how much does that bother you?  It don't bother me at all man  No back then  When he's trying to tell everybody  That you're  It didn't bother me at all  You see how slow I got?  You see I walked out on the fight?  You see I didn't punch?  It worried me  I asked him if he got his lunch 
[03:09:30]  That's all  Yeah  Joe  I ain't going nowhere  He did the same thing to Foreman  In Africa  He painted it  Where he was kind of the black hope  And Foreman was a representative  Of the white man  He did that to everybody  I think what Muhammad did  Most of the time  He probably was nervous  About us  The guys that he had fought  At the time  So therefore he was going to  Get hype up and crazy  Get the other guy nervous  You know what I mean?  But because  He didn't really know 
[03:10:00]  If these guys were going to fight  And when he got me  Oh my goodness  He was really surprised  You know what I mean?  He thought he was going to  Go over there  And run around  And dance  And act a fool  I said  I said  I said  I said  I said  I said  I said  I said  You were a hard guy  To hit Joe  You really were  Joe  We were just watching footage  Of how you would  Literally duck down  To waist level  And come  You were almost  An impossible guy  To get a good shot in on  I'm a  I'm a sliparoo  Yeah  I'm a fast  I'm a fast  He glazed me up 
[03:10:30]  He had some time  Closed eyes  You know  Did he hit as hard as Foreman?  No  No  Foreman  Nobody  He hit as George  George has a big meat  George be tied up  And still punch  He still punch  He said  I read Foreman  A great guy though  He said  He said  That he was scared of you  Foreman said  That he was afraid  Of Joe Frazier  And that was why  He said  When he knocked  Frazier down  The first time  He was scared  That he had really  Made you angry  And that you were  Really going to hurt him 
[03:11:00]  Come and get him  Yeah  He was afraid of you  Yeah  I wish  I wish he was like that  Oh you don't believe him  He's powerful  He's a powerful guy  He's a great guy  You know  He adds a lot of good things  To the boxing world  And you know  What we need to  Discuss now  Matter of fact  I don't know what they're doing  Because I don't know  Who's ahead of which  Champions in the world  Those guys  Are them guys  Who's  Being a part of this  Boxing world  I would hope 
[03:11:30]  That somebody  Step up  Let's say  God bless  Mr. Zulman  And the WBC  At least  Two sanctions  Wouldn't be bad  But all these  Crazy boxing  They got  One guy  I thought  Was making love  To the other one  In the ring  He got between  His legs  And started  Pumping around  And moving  His body  I said  What are you doing  It didn't look like  No fights  For us  That concern  Yeah we were just  Talking about  The lack of  Kind of  Excitement  In boxing  Now  Where you know 
[03:12:00]  There's none of these  Fighters that you go  Holy shit  I gotta see this fight  A clean sports  I mean boxing  Is one of the  Let's say  The cleanest sports  In the world  You know what I mean  We don't  We don't  Start playing basketball  In the ring  We don't play hockey  We don't play football  And everybody in the world  Wants to fight  On the court  On the football field  You know what I'm saying  We don't do that  We don't play no baseball  No basketball  I don't know that  You don't try to do  What they do  They try to do 
[03:12:30]  What you do  Fighting guns everywhere  There you go  Everybody wants  Like  Well why don't they  Come down to the ring  If you think you're that bad  I'll make a comeback  For some of them  Where would a guy like  I'm sure people have  Asked this before  But where would a guy  Like Mike Tyson  Who was like  One of the last big names  Or controversial names  Have stood up against  Guys like Ernie Shavers  Or Ken Norton  Or guys from your era  Well Mike had  Mike had cleaned his act up  You know what I mean  And let's say  You know you lost a daughter  Yeah  Yeah  I'm sorry to hear that 
[03:13:00]  Mike you know  But I've been to his  Open of his fam  And he looked like  He was a little small  And happy  Yeah  And I was happy for that  You know  And sometimes  You go into places  You're just  Related by the wrong  Kind of people  You understand  I'm not going to call  Nobody  I'm taking his name  But you know  Yeah you don't have to  You know  You know what I'm talking about  Nobody will say Don King  I know I'm not going to say it  No no  Don's not a bad guy man  Is he not?  No man  Don got the money 
[03:13:30]  That's all you want  The only thing he had to do  Is pay the money out  That's all  And that's a hard job  But he got the job right  So Don wasn't a bad guy  No  Yeah it wasn't  One for you  Two for me  One for you  Three for me  No no  It was like  That's what it was  The manager go get  Half 50-50  Alright  Right  Me and the fighter  Go back  And we get another 50  Another 50  The manager  Don't know that  Time to pay your bill off 
[03:14:00]  See  And Don don't say no  To the fighter  The fighter is the guy  That's doing the work  So he gave him the money  He got the tickets  Now when time comes  To pay back  Uh oh  The money got to  Come from you  And the manager  Don't know about that  See  Because you went behind  His back  You can't do that  That's not  That's not a problem  You know  For a fighter to do  I've done that  You know what I mean  But therefore  I pay everybody back  It was no crazy discussion 
[03:14:30]  You know  If I got your money  And your ticket  I want to pay you back  It's true  Let me ask you  As a fighter  Because I've never  Been knocked out  When you're fighting  A guy  Like you're in  You're in a situation  Where George Foreman  Hits you  I've never been  Knocked out  So don't ask me  Say knocked out  I've been knocked down  Yeah okay  When a guy like  Foreman hits you  Do you know  Like when he knocks  You down the first time  You're like  It's going to be  A long knife  No no  What I'm doing  Down here  Get up off 
[03:15:00]  For that thing  Yeah  Frazier was never  Knocked out  No I never  Knocked out  And you only  Lost to three guys  You lost to Foreman  Ali  And who was  The third guy  Yeah who was  The third guy  I don't even know  He no third guy  I really don't know  I only lost  I only lost  Two fights  Oh so there isn't  A third guy  George Foreman  Muhammad  He never beat me  Oh right  I keep forgetting  Ali didn't beat you  Look at him now  Look at me  You're right 
[03:15:30]  You're right  Ain't no sense  In going home  Judy got your gal  And go  You're pretty happy  That Ali's in the state  He's in  Well no  I'm not  I'm not happy  You know like  Sometimes  We don't look  At the things  That we say  And we do sometimes  God's a great God  You understand  And man  Let me finish  You don't  You don't go around  Talking about  I am the  And you could be 
[03:16:00]  The  This that  The  You don't use that word  That's the king's word  The man above  About the  When we start  Talking about him  We can talk about  The master  You don't say the  The  This is God's payback  There you go  God said  Shut that down  And he didn't listen  Well  You really believe  That Ali  Is the way he is  Because of you  Right  And not the Parkinson's  Right  Do you believe  The beatings  You gave him  I  Well I was going to say  The Thrill of Manila fight 
[03:16:30]  It was such an amazing fight  A lot of people told Ali  You're done  Don't fight anymore  And he fought for what  Another five years  Guess what  You look at the family  You be the judge of it  I'm not going to  I'm not going to say one word  You know  We had three fights  Look at me  Ain't no sense  I'm going home  That's right  Are Joe and the knockouts  Getting back together  That's the question  Joe and the knockouts  Let's say 
[03:17:00]  I lost two fights  That's yours  Okay  All the rest of my fights  Now  I want you to get my record  Okay  And look at it  And it goes like this  K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O. K.O.  Knockout  Knockout  Knockout  Knockout  Knockout  That's how my record goes  So therefore  I lost two fights  To George  You know  He does not consider that a loss  And he was big  Woo  He's a big guy  The 14th round  Yeah  Let's 
[03:17:30]  Go ahead Jimmy  The 14th round  We want to talk about the 14th round  At Thrilla in Manila  One of the most famous rounds  Ever fought  I mean you guys  You fought I think  Two 15 round fights  And this was your 14th round  And when you look back  Which you guys didn't know at the time  Ali had told Dundee  To cut the gloves off  He couldn't come out  And you wanted to keep fighting  Yeah  And your guy stopped the fight  Because he was afraid  You were going to get  Mortally wounded  He was really afraid  No  The guy that stopped the fight  Because the guy knew  I had two implanted lens  In my eyes 
[03:18:00]  And I wasn't supposed to be fighting  But therefore  I got by the judges  You know  Read the sign  O  F  P  Z  Next sign  C  I  T  Covered up the same eye  Covered up the same eye  With the other hand  He switched hands  Covered the same eye  What Joe's referencing  Beautiful  No one really knew  That Joe couldn't really see 
[03:18:30]  Out of his left eye  Right  No one knew  Your people knew  But the opponents  Never knew that  You could not see  Out of the left  How much vision  In the left eye  When you were fighting  I would say  My great doctors know  That's why  I love them  Those guys  If we didn't have  Those guys  Man  Where would we be  Think about that  You know  Today they can  Take your heart out  Put it on the table  Operate on it  Put it back  Take it long out  Go out there  And get somebody's heart  Somebody's long 
[03:19:00]  I mean  Who would have thought  Something like this  Could happen  So  The doctor was there  For me  But what was  What was the percentage  Of sight in your left eye  When you were in your prime  When you were fighting  All these guys  The eye was gone  What happened  When I laid off  For a while  I came back  When I took on George  I had a lens  Now if you could remember  The first round  Was stopped  The first fight  Was stopped  In the first round  The second fight  Was stopped  In the sixth or seventh round  When George  Knocked that lens out  Then I  Couldn't tell him 
[03:19:30]  Wait a minute  You can't start  Looking around  For a lens  On the canvas  I might  Them  Times  You ought to meet my eyes  Try to put it in  With the glove  So I went  I went to war  With him  When the lens  Was knocked out of my eyes  Long other boxes  And moving  It was okay  But getting back  To the thrill in Manila  So we're talking  About the left eye  You couldn't really see out of  Right  And now Ali's  Working your right eye  So by the end  Of 14 rounds  You're in the corner  And you're pretty much blind  You could see maybe 
[03:20:00]  Out of a slit  Of your right eye  Maybe  I'm going to stay close  To him  But Eddie said  No  You ain't going out there  I'm not going to be responsible  But didn't Eddie  Look over to Ali's corner  And go  He doesn't look too good either  Okay  That's what I don't understand  I don't think  I don't think  He even warned him about that  Because he was  Because how Ali  Was slumped in the ring  In his corner  Yeah  He looked like  He was in deep trouble too  All right  And then someone  From your camp  Was sitting close to Ali  And heard Ali say 
[03:20:30]  Cut the gloves  I'm done  We couldn't  We couldn't go along  With that  Because we couldn't  Hear it  From his corner  But then you know  Hey listen  I'm happy  With the way  Things went  You know what I mean  You know  Now I hear  I'm making movies  I'm going out  I'm still talking  To the people  And  Ain't no sense  And going home  You still have  Golden pipes Joe  That's what's important  Dude we got  The gal and go  Hey did you ever  Resent the public 
[03:21:00]  Because  For the way  That they embraced Ali  Were you ever  Just angry at the public  For not seeing him  The way you saw him  No  There's a lot of people  In this world  You know  There's enough people  For me to share  With him the people  So if people love him  Better than do me  He's okay  No problem  They probably didn't  Love him  They love the style  And they love the noise  He makes  And they like  The way he handled  So they're also  People like  Love me  Because I come  To get the job done  I ask them 
[03:21:30]  Did you bring your lunch  Because I ain't going  No way  You know what I mean  So this kind of thing  The world  Has to share  You know  We all have to like  Share some  As long as  It's not crazy  Vision  As long as  It's a good idea  Good embraces  The people  Why not  Enjoy  You know  One of my favorite moments  From the thrill  In Manila  Is  And I had never  Seen this before  There's great footage  Of Joe and Ali  On a talk show  And he has just  Had enough of Ali  And Frasier stands up  And he wants to 
[03:22:00]  Knock Ali's teeth out  On the set of this TV show  And you punked Ali  Because Ali's like  Sit down Joe  And you wouldn't sit down  Grabbed him  And yeah they kind of  Tussled on the floor  A little bit  But the brother  Was in it  See the brother  Got in today  Yeah big ass  He had nothing  To do with it  Comes walking into the city  He had nothing  To do with it  But he was there  And you know  Well it was two  Brothers against me  One  So I grabbed  The closest guy to me  Was with Muhammad  So I dumped him on the floor  He saw Joe's look 
[03:22:30]  Though Joe was really  Just ready to street fight  Him right there  In the TV studio  It was so great  I'd never seen that footage  Before  And that wasn't  To hype the fighter  No  That was just pure anger  On your part  Mr. Frazier  That was my  Common smoke wave  That's right  Who was the second  Who was the second  Greatest fighter ever  I mean obviously  Number one is Joe Frazier  Well  Who's number two  Let's  Let's see  As we go along  Any young man  Or young lady  Reached the epitome  Of being the champion  Is a lot of work  They have reached  Their greatness 
[03:23:00]  You know what I mean  They're right  They're at that  Same margin  As Lewis  Let's see  Marciana  All the Dempsey  All them great guys  Man  We have reached that level  Of being the champion  Where else can you go  When you got to be  The champion of the world  Now you're talking about  The whole entire world  The station today  I don't really like  What's really going on  So when I get  A little quiet down  And rest a little bit  And get up  All those shocks  That I had  I lost the sun 
[03:23:30]  Friday  Saturday on Saturday  Some guy  Some guy arrived  By the bar  And shot in the bar  And killed him  Jesus  Sorry to hear you  Grandson  So I got to go back  And start all over again  I haven't been able  To get down to  My family yet  Because I've been  Traveling so far  Right  I came in  Saturday morning  From London  Wow  And this happened  Like Sunday morning  Damn  So I got to go back 
[03:24:00]  And find out  What to do with him  And see if we can  Track this scam  Booger down  Hmm  I hope they will  Give him to me  I'd like to do  A couple rounds  With him  No doubt  With his hand tied  Yeah you look like  You can still do  A lot of damage  I shook your hand  When you walked in  You still have  I'm 65  And I feel good  The Lord  Let's say  Terribly good to me  And I love it  I got 11 beautiful kids  About 36 grand 
[03:24:30]  Wow  Ain't no sense  And going home  Wow  You're not fighting  You're fucking  Who was your  Who was your  What did you have  I was fussing  Who was your travel  Companion  In the thrill in Manila  She was interviewed  A few times  And I need to know  More about your  Travel companion  Your travel companion  In the movie  It's a  White lady  White lady  She had like  A Philadelphia accent  I don't remember  They said Joe's  Travel companion  I don't remember  Her name  They just kept her  With the travel 
[03:25:00]  Companion  She's my secretary  The secretary  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  And she was great  Because the beauty  Of the thrill in Manila  Too  Ali went there  With his mistress  And he was partying  And having a good time  And Joe's like  Fuck that  He left his hotel  Went on the outskirts  Of town  And just  And all he thought  About was the fight  As Ali was just  Having a good old time  Yeah well  And that's when  That's how you surprised Ali  Because Ali thought  It was going to be  An easy fight for him  Now well  A man's lifestyle  Is lifestyle  You know  And you can't 
[03:25:30]  Break that away  From him right away  Sometimes we go  To the graveyard  Like that  You know  You can't make  No changes  Yeah  And the way he  Had been training  There's no way  That he's going  To be able  To get around  A guy like me  Alex and Marcia  Maybe Mike Tyson  Might have taken  So you know  His idea  That you know  You can't do that  But Ali was cocky  Because a great part  Of this film  Brings the mistress  To Manila  Goes to see  The Marcos  Right  I know  All the press is there 
[03:26:00]  And he basically  Introduces her  As his wife  I ain't gonna get in that  Yeah  His wife  His wife is back home  Going  What the fuck  Gets on a plane  The first plane  To Manila  Ali had some shit  You guys on the air  You guys on the air  You wanna play the language  Yeah we can curse  Satellite radio  Beep beep beep  No no no  It's okay  It's satellite radio  Satellite radio  Come on  Times have changed  Satellite radio  Satellite radio  Give us a curse Joe  Oh so you can sit  And words huh  Oh yes  Beep beep beep beep  Yeah yeah 
[03:26:30]  No beeping  Give us a good one  This is how you guys  Show go  Beep beep beep beep  Beep beep beep beep  Beep beep beep  Beep beep  Joe had a great quote  Beep beep beep  Beep beep beep  Beep beep beep  Beep beep  Actually that's what  Ali thinks every morning  I think Marvis actually  Said this in the documentary  I think it was Marvis  Who said that  You were watching  Ali light the Olympic torch  And I think he said  Like wow  What do you think of that  And you said  They should push him  Into the fire  Holy  Yeah he did say that 
[03:27:00]  Joe said that about Ali  Oh my god  Shh  And the voicemail thing  I got it here  If you call Joe's voicemail  I'll just jump in  This is what you get Ant  If he doesn't answer  The phone live  Oh let's hear  My name is  Smoking Joe Freight  Sharp as a razor  Yeah  Flows like the butterflies  Things like to me  I'm the man  And the job  You know  Look and see  Call me  Bye bye  I'm the man 
[03:27:30]  Who's done the job  Look and see  Wow  Damn  Yeah  The fight's been  Good to me  And I really love it  And I  I just want to  Tell the people  You know like  Who gets in it  You know  It's not a  It's not a game  Your life is on the line  You can get hurt  In the gym  You can get hurt  On the road  In the morning  Running  And somebody  Dug a hole  Dug in the ground  You don't see  Break your leg 
[03:28:00]  Break your neck  So these things  Could happen  In any kind of  Sports  But boxing  Is my game  And I love it  I don't want to  Go back to where  It's been  So a man  Can say  I'm a world champion  Right on  Then they'll feel better  You know  But what's all  Going on  I don't know  I'm going down  To talk to the president  I promise you that  I'm going to make  I'm going to make  A step toward that  As soon as those things  Quiet down  He got a heavy load 
[03:28:30]  Yeah he's a little busy  He got a heavy load  On his back  North Korea's been  Misbehaving lately  Yeah  Might have to deal with that  You don't need  No more of that  You know what I mean  I'll get around  Like maybe  Now he owns a car company  Joe I know we got to  Get you out of here  In a couple minutes  But the one thing  One other thing  About the documentary  Kind of made me sad  You're living in a room  Above your gym  The great Joe Frazier  It's in the movie  Thrilling Manila  Where are you living?  My house was done 
[03:29:00]  By the lady  Was on the screen  On television  Yeah  And she runs  Like a big business  In Wildwood  Pennsylvania  Wildwood  New Jersey  And successful  And you go in  The restaurant  And it's like this  Look around  The father got  Stuffed animals  All over the place  It's a beautiful place  And they open like  Six  Six months  Out of the year

[03:31:00]  Oh yeah  Of course  I've been cutting corner  You know  How about you  Now you're still  Joe Frazier  Are you still  Women still have to  Are you still picking up women  Because you're Joe Frazier  Are they still at least  Coming to you  And you know  You know  Do you still get  Yeah yeah  Well picture what happened  I was a guy like this  You know  I ain't gonna give you  No more than I can take  You know what I'm saying  I'm a big family  I came from a big family 
[03:31:30]  About 16  17 brothers and sisters  And I was a baby  So I was daddy's pet  You know what I'm saying  Me and my daddy  We were everywhere together  And I've seen everything he does  But therefore  Knocked right down  To the nitty gritty  You know  I probably  The people around  He probably  Steal a little kiss  Mom and dad gone  So I can talk now  He steal a little kiss  Every now and then  You know  So  Dad went in the front  Of the house  And I went in the back  You read 
[03:32:00]  You read between that a lot  Yeah  Doing a lot of that today  Joe  Probably one of the most  Recognizable fighters  Walking around  You get recognized a lot  Well Ali gets recognized a lot  Listen I think  The people  Yeah well  I went to like  Jesus  Malaysia  I went to  Let's say  The last place  On the world  I forgot the name  England 
[03:32:30]  France  Cleveland  Where do you  What  Cleveland  No it was  New Zealand  Okay  Oh damn  That's the last one  They don't know you  In New Zealand  You can't go no further  Yeah  Yeah  Like they like  They look like  The end of the world  Yeah they're too busy  With their sheets  To know who Joe Frazier is  But I know  The good people  You know  They're like maybe  A year or two  Behind us  But they're all good fans  And Australia  Hey Joe 
[03:33:00]  Did you  You cut up your  Olympic gold medal  Into 11 pieces  For all your kids  Is that true  Yes I did  Huh  I love them all  You got an extra piece  Laying around  I wouldn't mind  Yeah  I wouldn't mind  A piece of  A gold medal  Well you ought to  Talk to them about that  Yeah  Yeah right  They gave them away  Yeah  I don't really know  What the  Some of us still have it  I know  One daughter lost  Lost hers  Lost  Well you know  The old man  Might have borrowed  For something  You know  Oh wow 
[03:33:30]  But he went on  Don't worry about it  He up to talking  To his lord  The lord  Same with the other guy  Please  He took a trip down  Oh yeah  Yeah  So it's good to know  That Joe Frazier  Made up with Muhammad Ali  That's what we're learning today  They're good buddies now  And uh  Did he  That's a good question  Did Ali  After the fight  He apologized  He brought in your son  And he said  Uh  Because Ali was just  Say how tough you were  And what a great fighter you were  And he apologized to your son 
[03:34:00]  For all the things he said  And said tell your father  And you said  Well why didn't he come  And say that to me  That's right  That's right  Has he ever  Have you spoken to him  Since then  Uh  A couple  Maybe a couple times  He can't  He can't play himself  Like you and I  You know  So he can't  You know  And see all that  All that work  That work couldn't be done  By you and I  You know what I mean  That had to have been  The man above  Because you know  He had the same amount  Of fights  That you and I had  Even less  Less fights  Because these guys  Never went the distance 
[03:34:30]  You know what I'm saying  I've lost two to George  That I would admit to  You know  And then  Let's see  With  Tough guy  Was Bonavent  Ooh  He was tough  Who  And then  Bonavent  Oh Bonavent  Yeah Oscar  Oscar Bonavent  He's  He's gone on now  He went out there  And messed around  With a Mustang  Woman  In Vegas  Okay  Yeah  Oh the Mustang  Ranch  Mustang Ranch  Yeah  Oh okay  You know 
[03:35:00]  You know what happened  No  No more man  What happened Joe  Wait what happened  Sounds like it's a good story  I know  He got shot  At the Mustang Ranch  He got shot at the Mustang Ranch  Oh  Oof  Well if you're going to get shot anywhere  I'm pretty sure it was there  Yeah it was there  Let's see  No I'm going to put it  Before I get in trouble  He  Took one of the ladies with him  Back in this country  And I think she came back home  And he got the fool 
[03:35:30]  And came over here to get her  Oh boy  Ain't no sense in going home  Jesus  Keep  Me  In there  Across  Joe enjoys singing  I don't mind Joe singing  He's alright  Joe still got a left hook  Joe still got a left hook  He can sing all he wants  Hell yeah  No no no no  I'm looking at the ring  Joe has got some great jewelry  I mean you have  Champion jewelry  He's got a great gold  Necklace with a crown on it 
[03:36:00]  And a giant  Gold ring  And that ring would really hurt  If it crashed into your cheek  No no no no  Let me explain  This is my sign  I'm a Capricorn  Let's say  A king on top  And a boxing gloves  Alright  My doctor gave me that  This is a  Ten dollar gold piece  My doctor gave me that  My son gave me this  For a championship fight  You can see my finger  I've been trying to get out of here  And see you guys so fast 
[03:36:30]  I left my ring home  See I was  I got shit  The finger didn't do it  With the ring  So  Wow  It's like  Life's been good to me  And you know  I love people  I came from a big family  And let's say  I can't get too loud  Because my grandmother  Was light bright  Almost white  Oh yeah  A blonde  A black blonde  I eat like that  Really  My grandma 
[03:37:00]  On daddy's side  Mama's side  Was the Indian  Leave the Indian as long  They got  They got no trouble  Beside me  You beat them up  Hey Joe  There's a thing too  When you  All those years  When you and Ali  Were having your  Your problems  And you would refuse  I think he had a resentment  Against you  Because you beat him  You were the first guy  To beat Muhammad Ali  And did you ever  Call him Ali  Or were you always  Insisting on calling him  Cassius Clay  Well 
[03:37:30]  Out of respect  You know  And like  You know  If you want  To have that  That's his name  He won't  I'll call him Muhammad  You know  But when you get me mad  I can go the other way too  You know  And  I don't  I don't think  It's right  For any young man  To change his name  Once mama  Carry you  For nine months  And help you out  With mourning 
[03:38:00]  And then  If I give you a name  They can't change my name  I'm sorry  Mama said  Muhammad  Or Joseph  They're gonna stay there  Yeah I think you said that too  Nobody's gonna do that  Yeah  Didn't you say that his mama called him Clay  I'm gonna call him Clay  Wasn't that your quote  No no no no  His mother called him Clay  I said my mother  Gave me my name  I'm gonna keep my name  I'm not  Nobody changed my name  You know  The good man above  But not  Not the organization  Yeah cause he was angry  I think that  That you 
[03:38:30]  He's like  He won't even call me  He said at one point  That you wouldn't call him Ali  And he was  Oh yeah  That was well documented  In the film  Well Joe man  I beat him up  So I should be able to call him  What I wanted  Whatever you want  You certainly did  That's for sure  I mean  You stood 44 out of 44  Out of 45 rounds  And I still could fight  Yeah  Look at that  Yeah he's a great  Alright Joe's now punching himself  Joe has  But you have a rock hard  I don't know why I'm surprised  Joe Frazier has a rock hard 
[03:39:00]  Jimmy  Let Joe just punch you in the shoulder  No  Old school  Just a little punch to the shoulder  It wouldn't hurt anyone  Right Joe  Nah man  He's a little small guy  A little fella  Might crumb up his bones  You know what I mean  Hey Joe you like the UFC  What's that  The mixed martial arts fighters  The ultimate fighting  You scared me  I didn't know what you were talking about  The MMA  The karate fighting mix  No  You don't like it  No it's  It's no  There should never be  An answer 
[03:39:30]  For the fight game  Fight games  Is there  Nobody changing the rules  In the boxing game  In the basketball game  You gotta change the rules  In the football field  After the basketball  Or what hockey  Why boxing  You know what I mean  He's aware how to make  A lot of money  And what go  What the world be  We're just  We're just  We're just missing  Compromising  We're just missing  The great fighters though Joe  Yeah  We were talking before  You came in here  What was the last great fight 
[03:40:00]  Great boxing match  And we have to go back  Almost 10 years  10-11 years  We're thinking  Mayweather's pretty  Mayweather's a big fighter though  Mayweather gets a lot of  Interest  Not as much  Like when you and Ali fought  Or you and Foreman fought  The whole world  Wanted to know  Everybody in England  The whole world  Watched  There's no more of that  Well you  Go back  And Joe Louis  Those guys  Won't see what goes on  Why  Why  It's just to the point  Where the money is great 
[03:40:30]  The money is great  So everybody wants  To get in  And get their  Condulsion  You know what I mean  New word  Right  And that's the way  Hard to look at  They can come in  And get a little bruised  And bump a little slash  On it  Like the rastlers  You know what I mean  They bleed  And nobody  See you got hit  How that happened  I'm sorry for that  But you know  It's just one of them  Things that  Goes on man 
[03:41:00]  That you know  They got to get it back  Where it used to be  Right  That's all I can say  And uh  Alright  I'm going to go and talk  To the president  About it  I hope that he may accept it  Point me out to somebody  I'm going to carry more  Than me one  Get a couple of guys  You know  Who feel that way  To a box  And you know  Go up and sit down  Oh I thought you meant  Some muscle  Bring some muscle  With you to the White House  Huh  No man  It's got to be nice  To be Joe Frazier though  Just to say  Look I want to go  Talk to the president 
[03:41:30]  No  I'm not going to  Bug him  Because I know  He got his hands  Full right now  But maybe when  People are going to  Cool off and chill out  I'll go and talk to him  You should go  And then just stay  Until they throw you out  That's what I would  I ain't no runaway guy  No  Just take a punch from Joe  I don't want to take  A punch from Joe  Just in the shoulder  Joe  How about a little jab  A little jab  To Norton  Look he moved his shoulder  Nice and everything  Toward you  How embarrassing 
[03:42:00]  Would it be  If he hit me in the shoulder  And I died  That would be embarrassing  Alright we should get Joe  Out of here  Hey Joe  This thriller in Manila  Was great  It's Ali vs. Frazier  A vicious rivalry  And the greatest fight  Of all time  And I can't believe  I'm not just saying this  Because you're here  I cannot believe  How good this was  It's different  Than when we were kings  So if you saw that  And you liked it  This is the same style  But it's a totally  Different fight  Totally different interviews  Ferdy Pacheco  Is great in this 
[03:42:30]  The people from your corner  And your camp  That are in this  Are great  It was really moving  I was surprised  At how moving this was  Butch Lewis was really funny  In the film  Yeah  Good old Butch  Oh yeah the guy  That's  Oh Butch was my good friend  I know  We know that Joe  He was boogin' buddy  He was great  And Pacheco  Do you want to give him  A left hook or what  Who's this  Ferdy  You like Ferdy right  Ferdy Pacheco  Pacheco  Yeah  I didn't follow it too much  About what he was doing  But then  Butch was always there  For the guys 
[03:43:00]  Butch is like  Let's say  Don King  I mean  He talks a lot  You know what I'm saying  But the money is there  Right  I mean you can't remember  A lot of fighters  Don't like Don King  Come up with that money  Big button  A lot of fighters  Don't like Don King  Joe  We've had Don King  On the show  Can't get a worry  What have you done  Me?  What?  No what did he do  He said why don't people  Like him  What have Don done  Basically  They say that  You know  Don King  Took a lot more money 
[03:43:30]  Than he showed up  No  No no no no  The government  Ain't gonna let him  Do that  The boxing commissioner  Ain't gonna let him  Do that  So now  But the fighter  Gets the money  But therefore  One time  To pay the money back  He take a vacation  Like you don't remember  You know what I mean  Like  Well  Why you take this back  Because you got it  All right  You got this amount  Of tickets 
[03:44:00]  You got this amount  Of money  What you want me  To pay for the fight  Pay you  Pay the other guy  And then for tickets  Too  No  The man can't do that  He was only being  Nice to the guy  But I think  He's a great guy  You know  All right  He sought this  Big himself  With the money  Anyway  When he come out  Of the clink  Yeah  Yeah  So  Yeah I mean  Look he's got  An amazing story  Don King  Has an amazing story  I mean  You know  Been in jail  He killed two people  I think  And you know  Look at him now  All right 
[03:44:30]  Well the great  Joe Frazier  Yeah  I love this  I love this  DVD  It was  It was really  Really moving  And Joe is in it  Ali's not in  When we were Kings  Joe is in this  And he's interviewed  The whole thing  And you're brutally honest  You're brutally honest  And Joe is one of  The few guys alive  Who is not in awe  Of Muhammad Ali  When they finally  Showed some footage  We're trying to  Get you out of here  But then there's  Other things  That pop in your head  When you're in your  You're in your boxing gym  And they finally  Show footage from  Thrilla in Manila  And you're watching it 
[03:45:00]  And in the documentary  It says that you're  Watching this for the  First time  Is that true  That's true  You just didn't want  To see this fight  After it was done  Well  I don't  What  What can I learn  Out of it  Right  But you would think  If you're involved  With pretty much  The greatest fight  Of all time  That you would have  Seen a couple times  Over the years  I can't get very good  To train these guys  If I look at somebody else  Seeing what they're  Doing right or wrong  That's how I feel about it  Right  If I don't look at this guy  See what he's doing wrong  I'm never going to learn 
[03:45:30]  Anything from looking  At my fan  And then I'm going to  Rerun  I can't add anything  As the fan go along  It's already done  It was a great moment  Watching you  Watch this fight  For the first time  You can see in your eyes  Like you're really  You're there  You're reliving it  Like holy shit  You knew exactly  What combo  You were ready  To hit him with  And everything  I can't  I might have  Some of the older fights  Locked up upstairs  In my house  You know  Maybe now 
[03:46:00]  But then I don't know  I look at guys  Like Sugar Ray  Armstrong  Joe Lewis  Wild Sienna  I can learn  From them guys  What am I going to  Learn from me  Enough of a rerun  I was thinking  More nostalgia  Joe  You're looking at  Your old work  Like oh my god  Yeah this brings  Back memories  Kind of like  Looking at  A film of  I don't know  Family vacation  Who's the greatest  Fighter of all time  Do you think  It was Sugar Ray Robinson  What  Greatest fighter  Of all time  Do you think  It was Ray Robinson  You leave me out 
[03:46:30]  No no no  I'm saying  Joe now  You gotta punch him  Right  See now you gotta  Take the punch  I was saying  Who would Joe pick  Cause I asked  That question earlier  And I said  Who's the second  Greatest fighter  Acknowledging that  Joe Frazier's  The greatest ever  Jim  I was talking  About not heavyweights  Oh sorry  He's trying to  Get out of me  I like my teeth  I feel like  Anytime one of the  Guys have  Reached that epitome  Of being  A champion 
[03:47:00]  You know  It takes a lot  Of desire  And let's say  Sacrifice  See what I mean  Why  Some guys  Is like stumbling  On the base  They can't talk  They can't sing  Ain't no sense  And going home  You know  They can't really  Do this thing  It's not because  Somebody laced up  More than he was  A great fighter  You know  He didn't sacrifice  Sacrifice  Is where  You got  The control  When you 
[03:47:30]  Got to leave  The wife  The kids  The girlfriend  The boyfriend  If it's a girl  You know what I'm saying  It's a point  That you got to  Put all the things  Aside  There's no  Loving going on  For seven to eight weeks  Right  Right  Right  Alright  Women weaken legs  Right  Yeah  That was one of the sayings  I don't know  I don't know  About that  Because I went to  Training camp  For seven weeks  Eight weeks  So no sex  For seven to eight weeks  Before a fight  That's right  I come to win the fight 
[03:48:00]  Yeah  You got a lot of poison  In sex  I ain't going to get weak  A lot of poison  Joe why do the white guys  Bleed more than the black guys  In the ring  Why the what  The white guys bleed more  In the ring  Like Chuck Webner  Comes to mind  Doesn't necessarily  Have to be a color on it  Oh my god  I just probably  Have soft skin  Skin probably soft  Alright  Give me the grief  A lot of guys  Light bright  Damn near white  He probably not bleeds  You know what I mean  Because his skin is tough  Yeah  And I didn't 
[03:48:30]  I got  Alcohol  And water  And  Watched my face  A lot of it  Tough on my skin  Alright  Yeah  So I went  And let's say  I had one cut  But that big guy  Keep me with an uppercut  In my mouth  Boom uppercut  But therefore  I still got  Those are your real teeth  I see it  No they're all mine  Damn  He fought  Ollie three times  And Foreman twice  He still has all of his real teeth 
[03:49:00]  Very impressive  I got all of mine  I'm in the middleman  That's pretty impressive  Alright  They're saying  They got a  Oh we're okay  Okay cool  Oh alright  They're putting us out  No no no  We're okay  We didn't know the gag  Jesus  Yeah  There's a great scene  In when we were  In Thriller of Manila  When  Jesus  When he  Ollie punches your  He punches your mouthpiece  And it flies out  And goes into the 
[03:49:30]  The fifth row  Of the press  And it's a great shot  It's a really quick shot  If you didn't know  What was happening  You would think  Something flew across the screen  But he punches your mouthpiece out  And you just  You still keep fighting  Keep going  And he still has his teeth  Probably he didn't  Knock the bun  To protect  The front of your teeth  Back here  He's not going to shake it  The majority of the front teeth  That's what he  To whack in  More than anything else  And  God  Blessed me 
[03:50:00]  To keep all of mine  I got them all  And like  I don't  I don't  I don't think  I have no bad ones  No your teeth look fantastic  What's that  They look good  Yeah  They're all mine  They're mine  And  Because  Let's see  My fight was like this  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  Knock out  I  Had a hundred 
[03:50:30]  Fights  I had a hundred  Fight amateurs  And pro  I think I lost  Two to George  And that was it  And I lost  The rest of the guys  Got knocked out  So Joe  Are you going to sing again  I mean not  I mean  You went out and sang  For a little while  Right years ago  You were going out  On the road  And singing  Why'd you stop doing that  You want to have some fun  I certainly do  And now  The time is near  The time is here  Check my hopes  And  Prepare  I say  To take the dare 
[03:51:00]  All men  It's time to climb  Ride through them ropes  And  Face a man  Have a plan  But stage that plan  Not in the shy way  Well that's his right  But come to fight  Heck  I'll fight in my  My way  Oh so you did the  Sinatra song  You were away  No  Paul  Langer wrote them  Likes for me  Oh did he really  Yeah  Okay  Yeah he fought 
[03:51:30]  The Lister's won  A clean version  Of Ain't No Sense  And Going Home  Because they want  A ringtone  Can you give us  A little  Ain't No Sense  And Going Home  Because they want  To save it  As their ringtones  Who said that  The listeners  Want to hear  That when you were  Singing  Ain't No Sense  And Going Home  Yeah  Can you sing that line  Ain't No Sense  I wish I knew the words 
[03:52:00]  I want to belt  I want to belt out  A tune with Joe  I want to sing  A song with Frazier  I can't sing though  Take a left hawk  Jimmy  Can you sing  No  Yeah he can't actually  Happy birthday  I'm very good at  Jimmy's really good  At singing Joe  He's just being  You know  He's downplaying it  Just sing a song  For Joe  You look like  A happy day man  Yeah sing a song  For Joe  He's been singing  His ass off over here

[03:53:00]  On nothing else  So I know  Is that one part  Oh damn it  I only know  When a man loves a woman  How about I could  Just sing like  The one line with you  I could sing  The name of the song  And that's it  What's the name of the song  When a man loves a woman  Okay  Yeah that's what it is  You like country western  I do  But I don't know  Many country westerns  The Dixie Chicks  Well I pull out of  Pittsburgh  Rolling on these  To see boat  I got my diesel  On up  And I'm running  Like I never before  Scream step ahead

[03:54:00]  Words  Words is the most  Important thing  To let's say songs  A song yeah  Because sometimes  You know  You think about it  It says  Who's making love  To your old lady  While you out  Making love  You ever heard that  No  I said  Who's making love  To my old lady  While I'm  Out making love  Joe Frazier  That makes sense  It's a two-handed game  You know what I'm saying  You know what 
[03:54:30]  It's hard to think  No  You're out making love  And who's  At your house  What happens  They don't  They don't go to the house  They go shopping  Is that it  Okay  Bring that one bag  And go for it  All day long  Yeah  And then what are they  Doing the rest of the time  Who's making love  You better  Take your own work  If you don't  Smile  Oh man
