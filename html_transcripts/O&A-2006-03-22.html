<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts triumphantly announcing their return to XM Satellite Radio after their controversial firing from their Boston station for a prank involving a false report of the mayor's death.  Initial banter focused on the surprisingly lactate-free milk in the studio, quickly escalating into typical Opie and Anthony-style humorous bickering.  The conversation then shifted to a news story about a coyote loose in Central Park, prompting frequent guest Jimmy Norton to recount an embellished and increasingly absurd tale of a near-encounter with the animal. This led to speculation about the coyote's temperament and the media's sensationalized coverage, culminating in a brainstorm session about planting a shark in Central Park as a new prank.

The show then tackled the Deborah LaFave case, the teacher acquitted of having sex with a 14-year-old student, sparking a discussion about double standards and media reactions.  The hosts and callers debated LaFave's appearance and the various perspectives surrounding the case.  A significant portion of the broadcast was devoted to playing audio clips from Dateline's "To Catch a Predator," featuring conversations between undercover officers and men soliciting sex online with minors.  The hosts, callers (including a police officer who provided insights into the operation's procedures and psychology), and the hosts reacted to the clips with jokes and comments.  A brief discussion about a local politician's stance on police funding was also included.

The show included several callers, one promoting his band and another, Brad, hinting at an upcoming announcement from Elo, potentially related to a "fine channel" return.  A Texas Federal Marshal called in to share humorous anecdotes from his job, including a memorable breaker bar inscription.  The coyote story resurfaced, transitioning into a bizarre news report about a "leprechaun" sighting in Mobile, Alabama, which turned out to be a Black man with leprosy.  This prompted further humorous reactions and comments.

Harry Shearer joined the show in studio.  The conversation covered his radio and television experiences, his role as Derek Smalls in *This is Spinal Tap*, and his time on *Saturday Night Live*. Shearer discussed industry absurdities, promoted his new CD ("Harry Shearer Dropping Anchors") and DVD ("Now You See It"), and further contributed to the running gag about the Central Park coyote.  A cryptic conversation with Elo ensued, referencing a mysterious project known only as "the thing."

Further discussions involved news teases – a game guessing the actual stories behind sensationalized headlines. Josh Elliott from ESPN Classic joined, adding commentary and anecdotes from his sports broadcasting career.  This segment included tangents focusing on John Sterling's Yankees broadcasting style and more coyote anecdotes from Jimmy Norton.  The bizarre leprechaun/leprosy story was revisited, eliciting more laughter.  The "thing" project and ESPN Classic channel numbers were discussed, along with continued speculation about various news stories.

The show also covered Thurman Munson's death and a listener's over-the-top reaction, followed by more news tease analysis.  These teases included a man arrested for his mustache (mistaken identity), a possibly-cultish yoga group, and a mysterious killer injuring thousands of children annually.  Josh Elliott’s return sparked further tangents, including the hosts' dislike for *Sex and the City*, George Steinbrenner's health, and a bizarre AIDS-themed diet commercial.  A contest was announced, offering a trip to the NCAA tournament in exchange for an on-air stunt.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned as a future guest. The segment also touched upon a memorable cockroach encounter during a bowel movement.

Judah Friedlander’s in-studio appearance followed.  He discussed filming *Feast* (with real maggots) and his role in *Chapter 27*.  The show then played audio of a police sting operation targeting car thieves, followed by a discussion of hidden-camera shows and their comparison to "Internet Predator" stings. A brief interruption mentioned a bear (possibly a repeat of the earlier coyote footage) loose in Central Park.  Jim Norton recounted a negative experience with Gotham Comedy Club, expressing his strong dislike for it using offensive language. Friedlander plugged his own show at the club, despite Norton’s complaints.  Norton promoted his movie, "Southern Bells," and a caller, Spike, provided links to bait car videos.  The show concluded with humorous speculation about the Mobile, Alabama "leprechaun" sighting and a final discussion about American Idol and potential eliminations.  Heavy use of profanity and offensive language characterized much of the broadcast.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Technically, we didn't get fired. 
[00:04:00]  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:04:30]  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I like Opie and Anthony.  I like Opie and Anthony.  Opie is a big, beautiful, beautiful. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  Opie and Anthony show.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  ONA Body Rock!  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years. 
[00:05:30]  Is that so?  Who made you pull for this dump, huh?  Shut up.  Shut up.  You lie!  You're a fucking liar!  Shut up!  Yeah, that's a joke, son.  Don't you get it?  I made a funny, son, and you're not laughing.  You got good milk over there? 
[00:06:00]  Except that lactate shimmy.  Jimmy's got lactate, just in case you get the squirts.  Lactate.  Lactate.  Fat-free milk.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I have to.  What happened to the regular milk in this joint?  It gives him the runs.  Oh, no, it doesn't give me the runs.  What does lactose do to you, sir?  It does things to my insides that make my farts smell not as good as they normally would.  All right, I love lactate, then.  Believe me, you love it. 
[00:06:30]  But you're controlling the milk around here now.  I'm not.  Because of you, that's all they get is lactate.  They ask for something different.  I want regular milk for my coffee.  I pay for lactate, so they get me lactate.  For your coffee, does anything, like, for your coffee, it doesn't matter, does it?  Like, coffee, mate?  It doesn't roll at lactate.  Lactate, fat-free.  Good.  Easy to digest.  Atta boy.  20% more of the daily value of calcium than other milk.  For delicate innards like Jimmy. 
[00:07:00]  100% lactose-free.  Nice.  I have delicate innards.  I need some lactose.  His guts are a little testy.  Less.  Because no one's drinking it.  No, no, no, no.  It doesn't go bad.  Yeah, it doesn't go sour.  Well, that's wonderful.  It doesn't turn sour.  It doesn't give you sour stomach.  Sour.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We'll have a listener explain that in a little while.  Wow.  We're like two days away from vacation, so bear with us.  Please.  Hey, people. 
[00:07:30]  Anthony's not even taking his coat off.  It's just like where you work, okay?  Sometimes we fall into things that are just like your jobs.  Sure, we come in and have fun on a daily basis, but around vacation time, are you really pushing  to get those reports out?  Are you really?  Are you going to the boss and saying, what can I do in the last two days before vacay?  Or are you maybe taking a longer lunch?  And we realize in the long-term scheme of things, these two days don't mean shit. 
[00:08:00]  Don't matter.  They really don't.  Please.  We're just like you.  We're checking the weather in the Caribbean.  Look at my laurels, Opie.  Look at them.  I'm resting upon them.  I'm going to be there in two days.  Let me see how warm it is right now.  Well, you know what I'm thinking about?  Right now, I'm lying in the solarium on the ship, drinking a banana and rum drink.  That's where I am right now.  I'm not sitting here.  Look what we do, though.  We're going to have a fine show today. 
[00:08:30]  Of course.  Because we're that damn good.  We don't sacrifice.  We could have fine shows without even giving a shit what we do.  Well, there's a lot of great stories in the news, so that'll help us.  There's a coyote loose in Central Park.  Really?  For the rest of America, we have a little park called Central Park.  Maybe you've been there.  Maybe you haven't been there.  I don't know.  It's not that big.  How big is it, really?  Relatively speaking, no, it's not that big.  I think it's a mile by six miles, if I had to guess. 
[00:09:00]  Is that it?  Maybe.  That kind of sounds big now.  Does it?  Yeah, but then there's other things in there.  There's an ice rink, and then there's a horse stable, and then there's ponds and lakes and reservoirs.  I spent a whole day, though, walking around in there.  Like, it could take a whole day to kind of walk around the whole thing.  Yeah, definitely.  See everything.  Well, there's a coyote loose, and we were just telling Jimmy Norton, and Jimmy thinks he saw the wild coyote.  Jimmy.  I was almost injured by this animal. 
[00:09:30]  That's not what you just told us.  That's not even part of what you said.  I'm alive here by the grace of God.  You said you were driving home, and you saw what looked like a wild dog.  Exactly.  Or an unusual wild dog.  Yeah, but what if the car broke down right there?  Then what do I do?  I get out, and I'm attacked.  Because I don't like to help animals.  Yeah.  So anyway, I'm driving home last night, and I'm coming across the park.  In the caddy.  Oh, but of course.  Of course. 
[00:10:00]  You goose.  There's these yellow things that ride around that a lot of people jump into.  I wouldn't know what they are.  Annoyances.  Yeah, who knows.  Savages at the wheel.  Those things.  Yeah.  Steer with their feet.  So I was driving by the park last night, and I made a mental note.  I thought I saw a very odd-looking dog, but it wasn't a dog.  It was something very weird.  I thought it was a devil dog.  The devil dog, yes.  It was all skinny and creepy and mangy. 
[00:10:30]  And had cream filling.  Oh, I thought you meant Drake's version of the devil dog.  Sorry.  And I made a mental note that that is a very odd-looking wild.  I thought it was like a wild dog, or as I was telling you, a dingo.  A dingo.  The coyote, you'll look, it has longer legs than your standard dog of the same scale.  It's a little mangy-looking.  Yes.  Kind of rough, wiry hair.  I was looking around. 
[00:11:00]  Pointy snout.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the ears were pointed straight up.  It was really weird.  Yeah, okay.  You probably saw the coyote.  I saw the coyote that everyone's looking for.  Everyone's looking for it, Jimmy, and you saw it and you're jumping.  You should have stopped.  You think the press we could have gotten?  Oh, oh, ONA's Flunky catches or something.  At least get us our name in the paper.  Coming home from seeing a hooker.  Catches the wild coyote.  Rubs peanut butter on his genitals, trying to lure the coyote in.  Be friends, coyote. 
[00:11:30]  So I saw it.  I thought the coyote was cuter than the mess you were with last night, by the way.  No.  Well, which one?  So now I'm driving.  And I saw the coyote, and I got out, and I chased it.  Yeah.  Because I thought it would endanger people.  That's not what you told us before we went on the air.  It is.  No, it's not.  Jimmy was holding its paw to try to keep it in one place, and it actually chewed its own  paw off to get away from Jimmy.  I was raised by that coyote and its family in the woods, so I freed it. 
[00:12:00]  To keep it from growling, Jimmy put a breathe right strip on his snout, too.  So if you see a dog-like creature with a breathe right strip, it's the coyote.  So yeah, I did see.  I'm trying to think of where it was.  It was before.  So I was coming from the east side, and I went through the park at 65th.  Might have been 71st and 5th.  Like right over there, when you hit 5th Avenue, you've got to go south, and then you get to  65th, you'll make a right, and that takes you through the park to the west side.  So I'm almost positive.  Yeah, I was coming head on, so I'd say it was on the upper side. 
[00:12:30]  Was he on rocket skates chasing a tall bird?  No.  Because sometimes, I know they do that, or they'll fire themselves out of harpoon guns,  and just before they grab the bird, hit a big boulder.  No, I saw him, though.  He was falling off a cliff, and he was hovering in midair, and he looked.  Did you see his sign?  It usually says, yikes.  No?  As he falls.  So you saw the coyote.  Yeah, so I had an experience.  I'm glad I'm here today to talk about it. 
[00:13:00]  Thank God.  Because those things can be very, very frightened of people who run away.  They were doing car attacks.  Oh, was that it?  Oh, dude, I was reading about it before.  It was a bunch of people with cars, windows open, the dogs were just jumping and attacking.  And eating them.  Yeah, it's horrible.  You know the coyote, by the way?  They're making it sound like it's a coyote, and it's very scary and stuff.  They are so petrified of people.  You could, I would dare anybody to try to even get injured. 
[00:13:30]  I'll pay someone money if they get injured by this thing.  You could go right up to it and go, oh, booga, booga, booga.  Or whatever, you know, you want to do to try to get him angry.  And they just won't hurt you.  They're scared shitless.  They come down here a lot of times from the countryside around Manhattan.  I don't know how they get across the bridges.  What are you talking about?  How do they get across the bridge?  They either escape from the Central Park Zoo or some ass said, you know what, this could be fun for a few days.  And just let them in?  Yeah.  I think they come across the bridge or the tunnel. 
[00:14:00]  We have a great idea, man.  We want to put a shark in Central Park.  Yeah, we were going to do this in the lake.  Because I guarantee the media would go with it like crazy.  We were trying to do it last summer.  And it'd die real quick.  Yeah, but then the dead shark would be on the shores of one of these little lakes or ponds in Central Park.  The one that people have their radio-controlled sailboats in.  I love that one.  The media would go nuts.  Yes, especially we wanted to do this when the shark season was, the shark attack season was happening.  Yeah, when all you heard about was another shark attack. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, New Jersey sharks, can they hurt you?  A shark in Central Park?  We'll tell you about it.  Wait till you see the news reports on the coyote.  I'm sure they're making it a lot worse than it is.  Yeah.  So there you go.  What happens?  They'll talk to an expert.  What if now you're walking through the park and you see this?  Well, the best thing is just stay clear.  Call 911 and let professionals deal with this.  They'll get animal control in there because they are wild animals. 
[00:15:00]  I want to stress this.  Though they might look like a dog, these are...  Shut up.  Shut up.  The coyote is the tamest animal in Central Park.  Oh, please.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  There's plenty of other animals you've got to worry about in Central Park.  If I saw a coyote in Central Park, I would feel much safer.  Yeah, all right.  I don't think a woman is going to be hit over the head with a cobblestone and raped by a coyote.  If you walked up and yelled ooga booga to the coyote, he would run and five guys would come out and answer.  Yes. 
[00:15:30]  Let's see.  A wily coyote.  A wily coyote on the prowl inside Central Park.  He looted cops for hours last night after several people, including little Jimmy Norton, reported seeing the wild animal.  Cops fanned out across the park with the help of a police chopper flying overhead in search of the coyote,  starting at around 4.30 p.m. in the southeastern corner of the park.  Several passerbys alerted Parks Department workers that they had seen a wolf-like animal inside the park at around 2.30 p.m. 
[00:16:00]  near the pond on East 59th Street.  Park Department.  Can we get a map with pins in it?  Parks Department workers point out the animal to Peneep, whoever the hell Peneep is, or Beneep,  who had made his way there after hearing about the sightings hanging out near a tree at East 63rd Street and Fifth Avenue.  It was a big, healthy coyote.  It was hiding near a fallen tree.  That's when the search for the coyote intensified as cops and animal control officers, armed with tranquilizer guns, joined the chase. 
[00:16:30]  Armed with a pork chop.  That'll do it.  Armed with a pork chop and a leash.  How much do you want to bet this story ends with a dead coyote?  Oh, absolutely.  Because, you know, they've got to protect us.  It's coming right for us.  Can't have a coyote running around wild.  When I saw it, it was on Fifth Avenue, and it was very dangerous.  It was very late.  Park officials said they received the first call of a coyote sighting Monday afternoon near East 59th Street. 
[00:17:00]  The coyote has been hunting birds and ducks.  The staff has found several piles of feathers.  Cops also spotted the coyote and spent hours chasing it, even failing to hit it after shooting tranquilizer darts at it until the search was called off for the night at 9.30 p.m.  Do they find these darts after they shoot them and miss, or are they sitting on the great lawn out there for some poor fuck that goes to sun to squat down on?  That'd be great. 
[00:17:30]  Wham right in the ass.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I need to talk to Jimmy right away, please.  Go ahead.  Glad to be alive, Mike.  How are you?  Exact location of the coyote.  This is the Acme delivery man.  I need to get the anvil over to him right away.  Oh, did he order an anvil?  Wow, that's odd.  Well, you know, sir, we'll see how much you make light of it when your life's on the line.  You don't need to get out of your car.  You just push that red cross. 
[00:18:00]  He didn't get out of the car!  Sir?  He rolled up the windows and fleed the area.  Later, boys.  All right.  This is an actual OnStar recording.  I'm Jimmy Norton, and I see a coyote.  Please send help.  I'm in my caddy, and I'm very scared.  Who are you calling, Daddy?  Shut up, you.  Keep sucking.  Who are you calling, Daddy? 
[00:18:30]  I don't like no coyotes.  They might take my wig and run away with it.  Mr. Kirkland said I'll be out on probation.  All right.  We'll get the news stories on the old coyote loose in Central Park, because you know the  news is spinning this nicely.  Oh, a coyote would attack.  Let's see what else is going on.  It would be great if you did attack somebody, a kid or something.  Oh, the hunt, the news, the fear.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, please, a small child.  At that point, everyone would get their pitchforks and their torches.  Oh, like village mob.  Oh, Billy's mob. 
[00:19:00]  Please tear the leg off a baby and run with it.  Oh, would that be great?  Just puts his pointy little mangy snout in a stroller and just walks away with a child  by the head, by that big soft spot.  Shaking vigorously as the mother screams in horror.  The police are going to follow socks and a Winnie the Pooh thing that's all ripped up.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Albany.  Brian.  Morning, guys.  Hello, Brian.  Hey there.  I was wondering if you guys were going to talk about the hot, sexy teacher in Tampa that 
[00:19:30]  just got off from molesting the 14-year-old boy.  Deborah LaFave.  My fave pedophile.  Deborah LaFave.  She is, they showed her on the news last night, big story down there in Florida, Opie.  Apparently, they were going to cut a guilty deal.  They're going to give her a guilty plea to reduce charges, which would have given her two  years of probation and at-home arrest. 
[00:20:00]  She had to wear a little ankle bracelet.  I'm sure it would have looked lovely on those legs of hers.  And she could just stay home and go out for work, things like that.  They offered her that plea.  The judge saying, that's not enough.  That's ridiculous.  This woman's a predator, a pedophile.  No, we're going to try to take this to trial.  Well, the prosecution then turns around and says, Your Honor, we don't really have a case. 
[00:20:30]  The kid doesn't want to testify.  The kid's parents don't want him to testify.  We don't have enough, really, to take this to trial.  So, bye-bye.  So, she got completely off the hook for this one in Florida.  She's got another thing that she's spending two years probation and home arrest from another  state.  And the kid didn't want to testify because it's going to turn out to be the greatest day  of his life or the greatest week of his life, however long that went on.  Yep.  And I think he doesn't want to make any enemies with her.  Would you?  A couple of years go by. 
[00:21:00]  He's of age.  He's back fucking her.  Good point.  Because it wasn't a...  Big point.  It wasn't one of the friends that blew up this kid's spot.  Yeah.  It wasn't the kid that was all distraught.  No, no.  A friend in the backseat.  A friend in the backseat.  A friend that had to watch his friend fuck this babe.  Of course he's going to rat.  Right.  At least give him a little tug.  Yeah, the kid had no problem.  Something helped the kid out.  The kid had no problem fucking the hot 25-year-old teacher.  Right.  That's every 14-year-old's dream.  Please, of course it is.  When you were 14, did you dream about that crap? 
[00:21:30]  Dude, and she is just model hot.  Right.  She's like...  I dreamed about my teachers and they were like fours.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because you're 14 getting rods like, you know...  Oh.  Wearing their culottes.  Right.  You're getting rods all day long.  You're 14 and you had a teacher that you looked up to and if you look back now, you'd realize  she was only a four.  Yeah.  But you thought she was the hottest thing going.  And this chick's a 10.  She's a 10.  And of course the kid's not going to testify. 
[00:22:00]  I think she called him and said, look, please.  No.  No.  The kid had no problem with this.  It was his friend and then the parents got involved like, oh, my baby.  My baby.  Yeah.  She started blaming the media last night.  She's like, the media blew this out of proportion.  Blew.  I thought it was funny that she used that word.  Blew it out of proportion.  And they were victimizing the young man, as she put it.  She didn't say child or boy.  She goes, the young man is suffering enough from this and I don't think the media has to 
[00:22:30]  make it that much worse.  And it didn't matter what she said.  Could you imagine a 25-year-old man, a 14-year-old girl that's a student of his in the middle school.  If he fucks her, blames the media, and gets let off the hook, it would never, ever happen.  It is a huge double standard.  Of course it is.  Which, you know, I guess is fine.  Whatever.  There is something creepy.  There's something creepy about a woman. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, the picture of her in the paper.  There's something creepy about an old guy and a young girl at school like that.  But there's something just incredibly hot as a guy looking and remembering 14 and this  teacher is just hotness.  And it affects not only guys that are talking like guys, but obviously it affects judges  and lawyers and professional people.  They looked at her.  They looked into those blue eyes and blonde hair and just said, you can leave. 
[00:23:30]  You're free to go.  Take a walk.  Please try not to do it again, but if you do, I'd be happy to read the transcripts all  over again.  She's sucking his cock, fucking him.  Oh, did you read all the transcripts to that case?  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's Penthouse Forum times 10.  Well, where is it?  On the smoking gun.  Yeah, let's read it again.  It's on the smoking gun.  Hey, you like that picture of her on the motorcycle?  I'm not a fan of the motorcycle picture.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[00:24:00]  Because that's a teacher and because I know she banged a 14-year-old student, yes.  Yeah.  She's got an amazing face, but her body is, you know.  It's good.  It's good.  If you threw a stalker Patty's head on that body, you'd be like, wow, this body isn't  that great.  She's a beautiful girl.  Patty's head on any body.  Thanks for ruining that buzz.  I want to date her.  She goes through some weight fluctuations, this girl.  She could be a little chubby at times, which she wears well, mind you.  And then she can slim down.  So there's a lot of different pictures that are looking.  There's no real shape to her. 
[00:24:30]  She's not fat.  That picture's not good.  She's kind of putting her butt out a little bit and arching her back.  And instead, she's not sucking in her belly a little bit to give her some rib action there.  Right.  But when she's standing in that courtroom trying to look demure, she's looking excellent.  And a lot of critics of the judge saying that if the prosecution is willing to cut a deal,  then it's supposed to be some kind of a signal to the judge that they don't have a case. 
[00:25:00]  And the judge fucked up by not seeing this and deciding, no, we're not taking the plea deal.  This is horrible.  She's going to trial.  Because it's supposed to be the judge is going to look and go, well, the prosecution is saying we want to cut a deal.  It means the prosecution doesn't have a case.  So you don't turn around and say, no, we're not accepting the deal.  We're going to trial.  Because then what happens, happens.  And the prosecution comes up to you and goes, Judge, we don't have anything.  All right.  You're free to go.  Let's say hi to Momo. 
[00:25:30]  Momo.  Hi.  Good morning, fellas.  Howdy.  You going to talk about this or you going to talk about something else?  Because we never know with you when you call our show.  I know.  I'm just a wild.  I'm a wild and greasy guy.  You're one of those wild listeners.  That's right.  All right.  What's up, Momo?  What I was going to say was I was going to agree with Anthony, but I also wanted to add to what he said by saying that from what I understood from watching the news,  that the prosecution did have a case, but because both of the victim, the victim's family and the prosecutor, they basically said that they wanted to get this under, you know, put it behind him as quickly as possible. 
[00:26:00]  That was the reason for the plea agreement.  Right.  But the – for whatever reason, the judge said no, and the reason that they speculate that the prosecutor dropped the case was basically to flip the judge off.  I mean, it pissed the prosecutor off by saying – by not taking the plea agreement.  They said it was very unusual, you know, for a judge to refuse to take the agreement. 
[00:26:30]  That's what I said.  Well, Duke, no, no, no, you make a good point.  What kind of animal was seen running around in the park, if you're going to just reiterate?  A coyote.  Thank you, sir.  Very good, Momo.  All right.  Thank you, Momo.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Westchester.  Tim, what's going on today?  Yeah, I wanted to call Anthony out.  What a pussy he is knowing what the culottes are.  Culottes, sir, were very, very big when me and Opie were little school children. 
[00:27:00]  So, yeah, we know what they are.  I don't know what they are.  I just nodded and said, yeah, yeah, you're right, Ant.  I'm not even sure what they are.  Jimmy, do you know what a culottes is?  Aren't they, like, big, goofy-looking shorts?  Yes, they are.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, and the teachers in the, like, 70s always wore them.  So why would you call them just big, goofy shorts?  Because they had names.  They were called culottes.  And teachers back in the 70s would always come in wearing culottes.  Yeah, I had a seventh-grade teacher who wore culottes, Miss Hennessy. 
[00:27:30]  You faggot, you know what they were?  I don't know what they are.  You're humming, you're bleeding.  I don't know what they are.  They're big, goofy shorts.  Like, big, 70s, puffy, short things.  That's wonderful.  Thanks for it.  There they are.  Okay, they're not necessarily shorts.  They could come up mid-calf or up to the knee.  Oh, there's a name for those things?  Those are culottes.  They're long pants.  They're with big bell-bottoms on them so you can see your go-go boots.  They're kind of like long shorts.  Yeah, long shorts.  Or short regular pants. 
[00:28:00]  They're big bell-bottoms.  They're in between shorts and pants.  Fascinating look that I hope comes back this season.  I always called them medium slacks.  Yes, the medium slacks.  They look like regular pants that a coyote has bitten the bottom of those.  Hey, you would know.  Yeah.  How's your pant leg there?  For the grace of God there, Goliath.  Shut up.  Close call for Jimmy.  Bryce in Montana.  Bryce?  Hey there, Bryce.  Yeah, I'm just going to comment on this.  You know how you're saying it's a double standard with this teacher. 
[00:28:30]  If the double standard's been set by children's parents and by us as guys, because if my 14-year-old  son fucks a teacher that I know I want to fuck but I can't, I'm throwing high fives.  But if my 14-year-old daughter gets fucked by her teacher, I'm going to kill the fucker.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, see?  There is a double standard, but, you know, there are plenty of double standards, just  the way the world is.  This is what happens to work in our favor.  It certainly does.  I think if she was an ugly old hag, she'd have seen some time, too.  I think she'd have seen some time. 
[00:29:00]  I think anyone in their right mind knew, oh my God, we cannot put that in prison.  We cannot put her in a woman's prison.  It would just be the smorgasbord that just wheel her in on a fucking carving table like  you see at a banquet and have a big silver thing over her that someone could pull off  and go, voila, and just feeding time.  Because imagine that, walking into a woman's prison. 
[00:29:30]  Ladies, the buffet is open.  Oh, forget about it.  Drop everything and pick up your brooms and plungers, ladies.  It's all about eating pussy today.  She looks, uh, do you know who she looks like?  Who?  On PalTalk.  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  Tara from MySpace, who's on PalTalk.  I don't know if she's on right now, but she's one of the regulars that comes in here.  And that's, I was looking at the whole thing, who does she look like in the face?  That's what she looks like.  That's who, all right.  All right, moving on. 
[00:30:00]  Pre-solicit sex from cop.  Ooh, hotter we go.  Where's this?  Why?  Day is, it's hot day in the news.  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why,  Wiley Coyote in Central Park, Romp, I got that, I can't wait to get the news stories on the wild coyote, and, uh, hey, hey, look, it says Wiley.  Uh, ex-priest in Long Island perv bust.  Perv bust.  When are they going to learn?  A former priest tried to solicit sex from an undercover Long Island cop posing on the internet as a computer programmer. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, no, Jimmy.  As a 14-year-old boy, Nassau police said yesterday.  Hey, Thomas Bender, 72, of Pennsylvania.  Yes, Anthony.  They're, uh, just to reiterate there, they're never 14-year-old boys.  Yeah.  Believe me.  When are they going to learn?  When are they going to learn?  They never learn, these people. 
[00:31:00]  They never, I want to hear from one pervert out there that actually hooked up with a 14-year-old boy or a girl or anything.  They just aren't out there.  They are all cops.  They're just hoping against hope.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, do you want to hear or do you want to interrupt?  Oh, Jimmy.  Ah, shit.  Jimmy doesn't mean that.  He had a stressful night running away from the coyote.  Coyote.  Yeah, well, while you guys are sleeping.  Running for his life.  While you're sleeping in your beds, I'm trying to keep the city safe.  Good luck to you. 
[00:31:30]  Thomas Bender, 72, of Pennsylvania, had several online conversations with the undercover officer dating back to September 2004.  He traveled to Long Island yesterday to meet with the supposed teen with the intention of taking him to a hotel room, cop said.  Instead, he was arrested and charged with an attempted criminal sex act and attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor.  Inseminate.  So, there you go.  They got another one overnight. 
[00:32:00]  What a buzzkill that is.  You're all horned up.  Fucking.  You're just foaming.  Ready for a youngster?  Yeah.  I just came to get something to eat.  What was that?  That's a guy.  I guarantee that's a guy from Perverted Justice that caught the McDonald's.  Oh, right.  I just came to get something to eat.  Right.  He was going to McDonald's to hook up with a 14-year-old boy.  The day after they busted him somewhere else.  Yeah.  And this is his excuse.  I just came to get something to eat.  I just came to get something to eat.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah, that would have been.  Oh, there she is.  Would have made it.  Yeah, there she is. 
[00:32:30]  Look at the.  What does she sound like?  What does she sound like?  She sounds hot and stupid.  That's taken away from me.  I've lost family and I've lost friends.  Oh, no.  You made a whole bunch of new friends.  As you can see, my face has been plastered on every internet address, every news outlet.  Yep.  And that's not easy.  It's not easy feeling the guilt and the remorse and having my own family suffer for my actions.  My greatest regret would probably be the fact that I put this young man through this. 
[00:33:00]  Nothing?  I mean, the media has totally taken it out of proportion and I believe that I'm going through  therapy and doing everything that I can possible to better myself for the community and society.  I'm a strong Christian woman and I believe that God has a path for me and this was just  a bump in the road.  Playboy, a path of gummy bears that leads to a 14-year-old cock.  The person is causing a lot of controversy and joining us now.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I would date her and I would parade her around and hold her hand. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Why not?  And introduce her to my nephew and give him a wink.  That's funny.  She's a goer.  Yeah.  Knock off a piece.  You want to play a little more Dateline Internet Predators episode three?  Oh, please.  Episode three?  Stop.  Was that three?  Yeah, we never got to the end of it.  We got a few more guys.  Yeah.  Because we got another perv in the news today.  Predators.  We might as well play a little more of this audio.  This is some of the greatest audio ever. 
[00:34:00]  It's the best reality show on TV.  It beats American Idol hands down.  Hands down.  They set up that old house somewhere in California.  And now you got the copycats.  They're doing the same thing on Long Island.  They're doing it.  Frightening for the perverts out there.  They're doing it all over America now because of Dateline.  They're just renting a house for a day and getting the pervs to show up hoping they're  going to meet something young and fresh.  Do they ever, do the perverts ever offer to send a car, pick up the 14-year-old, and bring 
[00:34:30]  them to your place?  Is that illegal?  Wow.  Good idea.  Because the cop can't really hop in a car and drive to your house.  Then they're kind of coming to meet you.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't?  I'm sure there's some excuse like, I can't do that.  You're going to have to come here.  And then the pervs are all.  Hold on.  I've got to get my phone.  Yeah, cancel the limo today that I had going to the middle school.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Chicken's always funny.  Trying to recover.  It's only, it's actually not a bad idea.  It's more of an interesting suggestion like, could you do that?  Could you?  But then again, if they're sent, the cop would actually just get in the car and show up  and fuck you.  But then they couldn't because then it's just like, you know, what are they going to do?  Or get out of the limo, you go, that's the 14-year-old boy I want to fuck.  Oops.  Maybe you shouldn't say that.  You're 45 wearing a Boy Scout outfit, sir.  Hey, Chris on Long Island. 
[00:35:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, shit dicks?  What's up, fat tits?  What's up?  No, sir, you can say whatever you want, but I've been to hell and back, so I'm happy.  How are you?  I'm all right, guys.  Well, first of all, I'm a teacher on my way to school.  And after that first story, I got half a rod going.  Second of all, you said that there are never 14-year-old boys on the internet?  No, I said there are never 14-year-old boys that these people go to meet.  Oh, well, they are when they're playing chess against Opie.  Well, I'm sure they're on the internet, yes.  Ugh, drats! 
[00:36:00]  Kicking my ass in Counter-Strike, playing chess.  I was playing chess online until I realized I was playing like 12, 13-year-olds, and now  I haven't played chess since.  I'm so depressed.  I really thought I had some skills in chess, and I was playing online for a while, and  all of a sudden, it finally hit me one day when the kid writes, wow, you're pretty good.  I'm 12.  How old are you?  Oh, great.  And I went, I'm 15, because I couldn't cop to my age, because I was kicking this 12-year-old's 
[00:36:30]  ass in chess.  I felt like such a loser, and I haven't played chess since.  Are we taping this?  What is this?  This is the most hysterical.  It's a fucking candid camera for the cops.  Oh, set-up car!  Love set-up car.  They brought set-up car?  They brought back set-up car?  Look at the brothers.  Because they did this a while ago.  What it is, is they set up a car to be stolen, and it's set up where you can start it, and  then drive it for a while, but then the engine conks out, and the doors lock, and the cops  pull up, and there's no excuse. 
[00:37:00]  No excuse whatsoever.  They say, hey, I didn't do nothing.  Yo, I didn't do nothing.  And it's just brother after brother, or Puerto Rican after Puerto Rican, they pull out of these.  We're getting the audio of that?  We definitely should.  We're getting it.  All right, thanks, Dan.  Yeah, Danny.  All right, so let's get back to Dateline Internet Predators, episode three.  So this really old dude is going to the house that they set up with the cops to meet something  young.  I don't know if it's a girl or a guy.  Probably a guy.  Probably a boy.  And here's some of the fine audio. 
[00:37:30]  What you up to today?  Nothing.  Yeah, just to set up.  So the old dude is in the house, and all of a sudden now Dateline jumps into the room.  It's great.  They have a girl in there that could sound like a young boy or a young girl.  Yeah, and she gets them to come through the back door of the house, of course.  And there's the Dateline guy waiting for them.  Hold on a second.  Can we go to Jay, Chocolate City?  Jay, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let all the new listeners know what a lucky fella that little Jimmy is. 
[00:38:00]  He has now escaped Pearl and City Park, Central Park, two times.  He had that wall almost fall on him, fella.  You had a wall almost fall on you?  Yeah, when he was getting that knob job by that hooker, that retaining wall, about a year ago.  What?  All right, car crash.  Punching out.  You can't crash and then punch out.  I have no idea what that story is about.  Hold on.  Nathaniel, did Danny just send you in? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, thank you.  All right, here we go.  So the old dude is in the house and now Dateline pops into the room to give him the bad news.  What you up to today?  Nothing.  Call.  Talk with the gentleman.  I have a place that I have for sales.  Oh, you're selling a house.  Uh-huh.  I see.  He was interested.  Well, here's what doesn't make sense about that.  How is a 13-year-old going to afford to buy your home?  Well, I didn't know how old he was.  I didn't ask. 
[00:39:00]  Stop to ask his age.  Ah.  Well, Chuck, the only problem with that story is, is that I have the transcripts of your conversation with Luke.  Direct.  What are you looking for?  I could be your grandpa.  Into young boys your age.  Love to cuddle with them.  Caress their body.  Work my...  And it goes on from there.  Ah, work my...  I'm disgusted.  Let's play match game.  Work my...  Womp, bomb.  Da-da-dow-dow-dow-dow-dow-womp.  Da-da-dow-dow-dow-dow.  Hairless cock. 
[00:39:30]  Womp, bomb.  Can I say how much I hate this reporter's voice?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, is he a funny?  Oh, work my...  Blank.  He has too much joy in his soul that he's doing this job.  A 13-year-old boy.  Charles Nelson Riley, work my butthole.  I don't know.  All right, we have more.  Mark my prostate like a speed bag. 
[00:40:00]  Could you choke me with my ascot until I almost pass out?  Give me some poppers.  I like a guy that looks like Brett Summers.  Too good.  All right, we got more audio of the really old dude.  Finally, he decides to tell the truth.  And he actually admits that he might have had sex with the boy.  But if he would have consented to having sex, what would have happened? 
[00:40:30]  I'd be very hesitant at first.  If he continued, then possibly we would have had it.  Possibly you would have had sex with a 13-year-old boy.  If, you know, I felt uncomfortable and I felt that he was, you know,  not fit or anything, I would have walked away.  Not fit?  How can a 13-year-old boy be fit to have sex with a 65-year-old man?  I mean, fat.  Don't you see a picture there?  Well, I see nothing wrong with cuddling and caressing. 
[00:41:00]  Then he talks about a book he reads that fills him with fantasies.  It deals with younger, older, you know, father-son.  Father-son?  You're talking about fathers having sex with their sons,  grandfathers having sex with their grandkids.  Doctors with their patients, with the young patients,  employees with their young patients.  You talk about this like it's some sort of hobby, building train sets.  That's not what we're talking about here.  It's a book that I read and I fantasize. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  Way to not give out the title.  Is that on Oprah's list?  Oprah's book.  I don't think so.  I think that guy probably, I think his lawyer probably would have told him to shut up.  I think that was a bad thing he did there legally for his case.  That kid caused a problem.  I fantasize about.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  Young boy.  Hum-na.  Young man, a Cardi boy came up with a baseball bat. 
[00:42:00]  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  He's on Ed Knighton's baseball team.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  The book's called The Million...  Big ball, Knighton.  Pull the diaper off.  Grandpa will get it.  The book is called The Million Little Asses.  Here we go.  Some more audio from the old dude.  Are you ready to go on?  Yeah, come on in.  Here's a man with the screen name GuyFromMars83, who seems to think it's perfectly legal for  an adult to talk online to a 13-year-old about leading for sex. 
[00:42:30]  GuyFromMars.  It's my favorite book.  Men are from Mars.  Kids are from Sesame Street.  I think this is a new dude, huh?  Yeah.  This is a new guy.  I love him.  Are you ready to go on?  Yeah, come on in.  Here's a man with the screen name GuyFromMars83, who seems to think it's perfectly legal for  an adult to talk online to a 13-year-old about meeting for sex.  How are you?  Imagine the poor guy with the screen name GuyFromMars82.  Like, I've got to change my whole fucking screen name now. 
[00:43:00]  He's just a fan of this asshole.  He's a fan of astronomy.  That's all, you know.  Yeah.  GuyFromMars, you know.  Gets on with other geeks and talks about stars.  Hey, did you hear about the face on Mars?  There's really a face.  Looking from another.  What?  I'm not a pervert.  What the fuck?  No, that's the other.  One more up.  They're trying to rock with oxygen in it.  Yeah.  Bunch of guys.  GuyFromMars80, chatting with him.  Yeah.  GuyFromVenus.  They're having another problem with him because he wants to talk about Venus. 
[00:43:30]  And they're like, it's too close to the sun.  Have life, you dope.  That's a very good point.  ...to a 13-year-old about meeting for sex.  Hey, how are you?  What are you going to say?  And then show up at her house.  He's 23-year-old Inderjeet Singh.  Oh, boy.  Well, you can talk.  You can converse, but it doesn't mean I'm going to do it, right?  Unless I do it.  Unless you catch me on point doing it. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, well.  So you say I would have to catch you having sex with a 13-year-old girl before you could  get in trouble?  Maybe in India.  Before you can put me against the law.  It is against the law.  So you're a lawyer?  I'm not a lawyer.  Oh.  Well, you sound pretty familiar with the law.  Well, I'm pretty much into academics, so...  You're into academics.  Well, let me correct you a little bit on how the law works.  Okay.  Go ahead and turn around for me.  Please let me go because...  Let you go.  Let you go?  Why?  Right here.  I haven't done any other crime in the past. 
[00:44:30]  I'm very clean.  This is the first time?  Yes.  Okay.  Please believe me.  Well, I know.  I love the please let me go.  Like, what makes a person say that?  Is it that last-ditch effort?  Is it just the nothing?  Because...  Can you possibly think they're going to go,  he said it?  All right.  I guess we gotta.  They're not letting you go.  We should talk to the cops today,  because no matter what kind of crime you commit,  everyone does that. 
[00:45:00]  Please.  Please.  Please.  Come on, man.  Just let me go, and I'll...  It's the first time.  I'll never do it again.  All right.  All right, you wacky bastard.  You can go.  All right.  Let's talk to the cops.  I don't think it's ever happened.  And it's...  They always ask.  You make a good point.  Just put your hands behind your...  You gotta look.  You gotta step out of the moment.  You're not there anymore.  Or look ahead and see what you're gonna do  once you get to lock up,  to get out of that situation.  Because once they're doing it,  just put your hands behind your back 
[00:45:30]  and cooperate.  Don't talk to them.  Don't do anything.  Just go to jail.  And then decide how you're gonna get out of it.  Because asking, begging, talking, saying stuff,  it will all just work against you.  See, it's like the weird...  You're like an animal.  Like one minute you're relaxed  and you're ready to have sex.  The next minute you're a moose  sitting in a lady's car.  Like your head's sticking out the windshield.  You just can't believe it's happening.  So you're like, I panic.  That's like almost like...  That's stripped of all societal dignity. 
[00:46:00]  Stripped of all messages.  That's just basic.  That's the core of what you want to say.  Emotionally, it's one extreme to the other, too.  I mean solid.  One extreme to the other.  You're whipped up into this frenzy of sex  that, you know...  You think you're gonna have this  best fetish perverted sex  you're ever gonna have.  And then a couple of seconds later  you're being arrested.  Yeah.  Yikes.  Can you please just let me go?  No. 
[00:46:30]  Let me talk about it  with the guys over here.  That would be really funny.  Look, dude.  It's your first time?  Really?  Because then they'd be begging.  Yeah, yeah.  It's my...  Okay, shh, shh.  No cops do that  just to make their day a little more fun.  I'm gonna talk with my sergeant over here  because since it is your first time...  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.  And then talk and go,  Dude, I'm pulling the old...  This guy thinks he's getting old.  Look at it.  Now let's look over at him.  Look at his face.  How sorry he looks.  Ah!  And then all nod yes  and you take the handcuff keys out.  Take the cuff keys out.  Start walking over to him  and then just lock the cuffs  so they don't move. 
[00:47:00]  No, sorry.  I gotta take you in, asshole.  Yeah.  All right.  We got more audio  from the Dateline Internet Predators  Episode 3.  This guy is trying to be normal.  That's his screen name.  G.I., come on over here  and have a seat, please.  Ah, geez.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  All right.  Don't be fooled.  And until you hear more about him,  he's a convicted felon.  What's going on?  I'm just meeting a friend  that I met on the Internet.  Really?  He's 48-year-old Daniel Allen,  screen name Trying to be Normal. 
[00:47:30]  Online, he promised to teach a girl  who said she was 13  different sexual positions  and show her what a man really likes,  not sex.  I don't know how old I am.  That's why I'm here.  I'm just curious.  You're just curious.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't bring any booze with me.  I didn't absolutely curiosity.  Leave your dick at home?  Because I think that's the important part  of this whole thing.  Not the booze or the presents.  It's your dick.  Unless you left that at home,  please see the man in blue. 
[00:48:00]  His chat log suggests something else.  I will come to you  and we will get a place  for passionate love.  Yeah.  What does that sound like to you?  Good point.  It's old.  He says, oh my God, how cool.  And then you say,  wow, 13, am I too old?  Nah, am I too young?  I hate to say this,  but you're not.  Why do you hate to say that?  Because it's like I'm some old pervert,  but girls your age are so much more fun.  Let me say this. 
[00:48:30]  Go ahead.  Okay.  I've had conversations like this  with people that turn out to be guys  more than half the time.  Lucky fella.  Wait, but half the time they're not.  Half the time, yeah.  Good point.  Tell that to the judge.  He'll be very understanding.  Dope.  You know, a lot of times I fuck kids.  It turns out they're older men, your honor.  Bye.  I can empathize.  Get out of here.  Half the time.  They're not even kids.  And the other half the time,  they're infants.  They can't win. 
[00:49:00]  Don't you see something inappropriate about that?  Well, I mean, maybe so,  but I had my big doubts that she was 13.  Then he admits this isn't his first time.  You've visited people you met online  who said they were 13 before?  Well, yeah, 13 or 15.  So it's not the first time you've done this.  Well, no, wait a minute.  I've never met a 13-year-old girl from offline. 
[00:49:30]  Well, what I'm saying is,  did you ever go meet somebody  who said they were 13 online?  No, not 13.  16 in my area, and it was a guy  who had a big laugh on me.  He's raising the age, I'm dead, 45.  Grandfatherly.  And then it gets ugly.  You see how it looks.  I see how it looks.  You're absolutely right.  You know, I mean, you're right. 
[00:50:00]  Now it was time to tell him who I am.  I am Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC,  and we're doing a story on Computer Predators.  Ah, well, you better,  I'll shove that camera down his throat.  I don't think you're going to want to do that.  Why is that?  I don't think you'll want to do it.  Now, we can't keep you here.  If you want to say anything else to us,  we'd love to hear it.  You're free to leave, obviously,  if you want to go.  Okay, but can I talk to you outside?  No, I can't have the cameras turned off at this point.  I can't.  Well, then I'd like to say that 
[00:50:30]  pretty much I think you have it all wrong.  Pretty much.  But your point's well taken.  Hi, guys.  Pretty weird.  Cut.  I love the you're free to go part.  You're free to go for 10 feet,  and then you will be arrested.  That's him just being a pussy.  Yeah.  I can't turn the cameras off at this point.  You're free to go, because if he says  there's, you know, cops in the area,  then all hell's going to break loose,  and he doesn't want to deal with that.  I then read the transcript 
[00:51:00]  of the conversation that was about Graphic Slam.  God, his voice.  It's mind-boggling what a parody of a reporter he is.  Yep.  Just smarmy.  Sex.  Who talks like that?  I would like to meet you with you  and cuddle and touch each other.  Each other.  Really?  What is going through your mind  when you're writing most kind of...  Why is it going to hurt the story  if he goes, 
[00:51:30]  are you here to meet a minor for sex?  Are people going to go,  I know that's not official.  Yeah.  Who is this guy?  Hello, please take a seat.  Why are you talking like that?  Right.  That's what I'd say.  Forget about me fucking children.  Do a story on why you talk like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hairless asses get me high.  But your voice, sir,  it has to be fixed.  What is that?  Kevin the cop, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Long time, long time.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Kev.  Anthony, are you sure you weren't on the job? 
[00:52:00]  Why?  What's that, fella?  Because that whole thing with the handcuff keys  is so fucking accurate.  You do that?  Oh, my God.  I just thought it would be a hysterical joke.  That is so fucking accurate.  I swear to God.  I'm a highway cop out on the island.  I got a civilian complaint one time  for laughing so hard at you motherfuckers  that the person thought I was laughing at them  in their rearview mirror and wrote a letter.  Oh, no kidding.  So what do you do?  We know the cops very well.  You go to arrest them and they beg? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, all the time.  Yeah.  Everybody thinks it's just like,  okay, please, please.  Come on, God.  Give me a break, will you?  Have you ever let anybody go?  When you've got to lock somebody up,  you've got to lock them up.  I mean, there's so much liability involved.  Yeah.  But I let people go on the speeders all the time.  Right.  Speed, really?  I'm mostly just a speed guy.  Are you Suffolk or Nassau?  I'm in Nassau.  That's all I can say.  All right.  Watch out for Anthony. 
[00:53:00]  Nassau, guys.  I'll tell you, though.  Nassau Highway Patrol are some tough guys, man.  They are really tough to get out of a ticket with.  Well, you've got to understand something.  The precinct cops, it's a summons, you know, you've got to make some numbers and stuff like that.  They've got to be decent summonses.  But most of the time, you've got some leeway back and forth.  The reason why there are highway cops in the first place is because someone has to give the tickets and not give a break.  That's why they're there. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, you get pulled over by highway, you're getting a ticket.  No matter what.  That's their job.  Yeah.  If they start not giving out tickets, then what are they doing?  Sit around.  It's like Anthony said that Long Island cops don't have the balls to give him a ticket.  Hey, I didn't say that.  I love the Long Island cops.  No, you were just saying yesterday on the show, Anthony.  That's an escalade and a CRX, right?  Those brilliant cops on Long Island have to shovel up more drunken teens every weekend than anywhere else in the country.  No, but it was like you say, Anthony says he doesn't even really like to slow down. 
[00:54:00]  He'll just poke his lips by the window and go, I'm Anthony from the radio.  And they scatle back to the car like girls.  That's what Anne says.  At this point, I don't even have time to meet you and give you autographs.  You know, I can laugh along.  I've got somewhere to go.  I can laugh along with what Jimmy and Opie are saying because I am such a strong supporter of the police department that it comes off as a joke.  Because everyone knows that.  We know that.  And I hear you talking guns and stuff like that.  So maybe we'll come up in the air and get you down here to our range to shoot a little bit. 
[00:54:30]  And what do you guys think of Swazi?  Well, I don't work for Swazi, thank God.  No, but he's running.  And he wants to cut funding to the Nassau cops.  Well, he's been cutting the Nassau cops every weekend.  I say fuck Swazi.  Well, I agree.  Pay the cops what they deserve.  Did you see what this guy comes out of?  One million dollars apiece.  I'll bet you'd like him if his last name was Swisticka.  No.  Swazi.  You ass.  Hey, can I get a cheap plug for my band? 
[00:55:00]  Yes, Kevin.  Jerryandthenewcomers.com.  We want to get a gig at FH Riley.  Ooh.  400 New York Avenue, Huntington Station.  My brother's restaurant.  If you want to work cheap, we'll get you in.  No, we work cheap.  We don't have much money yet.  We've got to get more people into the place first.  We've got the best bar band in Nassau County.  We're going to get out to Huntington there and play at FH Riley.  Next time you're at FH, introduce yourself to my brother.  I sure will.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  Thanks, Jerry.  So glad to be finally on satellite with you guys.  Love every minute of it.  Laugh too hard during the day and get in trouble.  Right on.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye, mister.  All right.  All the best.  Stay safe.  Cool.  We love the cops.  Absolutely.  John in Texas, what's going on?  Thankless job.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Best part of this job is when we go in the middle of the night.  I'm a federal marshal, and we wake these guys up to pick them up, and they look at you  and say, hey, how you doing?  And they don't know where I'm coming from. 
[00:56:00]  Especially after we've just kicked in their door.  Hey, what's up, man?  What are you here for?  I didn't do anything.  We have a breaker bar that we go in the door, and on the side of it says, Matt, come in,  please.  That's funny.  Very good.  Texas Federal Marshal.  Thank you, John.  Tough guy, man.  That is really funny.  Brad in Cleveland.  We're going to take a break here.  We've got Harry Shearer that's going to come in and say hi to us in a few minutes.  All right.  Brad, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:56:30]  Back in February, Elo made mention he was going to have an announcement towards the end of  March, something that the Pests have been requesting, and wanted to see if he had  any info on that.  Yeah, you guys got something done.  And they're bringing back a fine channel.  I think Elo's going to be on the show today to talk about that and other things.  Hopefully we'll get him on maybe after the break or something.  Sweet.  Hopefully it's liquid metal.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You're going to have to wait and see.  Wow.  Wow.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, mister.  What about me?  I love you, too, buddy.  Love. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Thanks, Brad.  I'll miss you next week.  Aw.  Hey, we got a coyote loose in Central Park.  We're trying to get the news stories because, you know, look.  There it is.  Coyote on the loose.  Coyote on the loose.  And they're just showing an aerial shot of Central Park.  Where could it be?  Where could it be?  I think I saw him.  So, that's the big story in New York today.  We're dying to hear the news reports because, you know, they're just, like, getting out of control with this.  Panicky pizza.  Are your kids in danger?  The danger?  Well, there's a leprechaun on the loose in Alabama. 
[00:57:30]  What?  I swear to God.  This is a real news story.  Why can't we have the leprechaun?  Turns out it was just a Jew in a green sweater.  They've never seen one there.  Listen to this story.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yay?  Yay!  Uh-oh.  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night. 
[00:58:00]  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff and told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun.  You're going to get down to the bottom of this. 
[00:58:30]  You're still down there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This waters off smells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  And I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree. 
[00:59:00]  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold.  I want the gold.  Believe it or not, this is happening in the same country that we live in.  I thought Chappelle's show wasn't coming back for another season.  That could not be a real newscast.  That's a real news story.  They actually did figure out what it was.  From Mobile, Alabama.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy?  It turns out what they were looking at was a black gentleman with leprosy. 
[00:59:30]  No, that's not a leprechaun, Jimmy.  Close.  Oh, my God.  That old dad.  You fucking asshole.  Too bad a coyote didn't get you last night.  Yeah, well, it almost did.  You say that now because I'm here, but how would you feel if it was just a pair of shoes?  I think you have some traumatic stress from that attack.  Post-traumatic stress disorder?  Post-traumatic stress disorder.  I do.  That's why I'm trying not to bring it up. 
[01:00:00]  I see you kind of get scared.  Yeah, because I feel like the animal put something in me, like Nicholson had a wolf.  Oh, there you go.  How funny is that story, though?  That's in Mobile, Alabama.  That's a great one.  I want the gold.  Don't get me back on a broochette tree.  They swear there's a leprechaun loose down there, and the locals are looking for the leprechaun  and the gold and everything else.  Yeah, malt liquor will do that.  This is in America, yes.  No, Opie, that's where you're mistaken.  That is nowhere near America.  That is some faraway land. 
[01:00:30]  Well, now the pissed-off Southerners start calling.  Reno and Mississippi.  Reno!  Oh, you guys kill us.  We're like such idiots down here in the South.  That's a real news story down there.  Oh, God.  I know those people.  I see them every day.  Every day.  Must be a crackhead.  That must be a crackhead that's got a hole with some bad stuff.  That was up in the tree.  It's bad, but... 
[01:01:00]  You can't defend yourself today, Reno.  Take it.  No, that's it.  Later.  Goodbye, goose.  Let's go to a local in Alabama.  Doesn't even want to say his name.  Local in Alabama.  Who?  What's up, local?  Hey, this is Russell.  Russell, what's up?  It says local on the phone.  Nice screening.  Nice screening.  I am local, I guess.  I swear all of us don't sound like that.  You tell what kind of neighborhood that came from, right?  Yes.  No. 
[01:01:30]  What kind?  They really believe there's a leprechaun loose.  Oh, is that right?  I don't know.  We know there's a coyote loose in New York.  Oh, is that right?  Sure.  A leprechaun, though.  Come on.  We're going to have to play that again.  That's way too far.  There's no such thing.  That's almost as good as Boo got shot, by the way.  Yeah.  By the way, I sent that in.  My brother emailed it to me, and I emailed it to Steve, so I just wanted to let you know  why you brought that up.  Oh, you sent it in, Russell?  Yes, sir.  Oh, you rock.  You gave us gold today.  Thank you.  That was a real news report, right? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, that was it.  That was a bunch of damn idiots down there, dude.  Some of us are educated, some of us are not, but you can't blame us all, though.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, Russell.  I appreciate it.  Punching out.  All right.  There you go.  Unbelievable.  All right.  With that, we should take our first break, I guess.  Right-o.  We got Harry Shearer stopping by to say hi.  That should be fun.  Boy.  I don't know.  Steve just walked in. 
[01:02:30]  What's up, Steve?  Just passing a note.  Oh.  Passing notes.  Would you like to read it for the entire studio?  All right.  Write your note.  Write the note.  Okay.  Write it.  Here we go.  One jar honey.  Yes.  Some nuts and berries.  Pillow for cave.  Harry Shearer is here.  Can you just walk up to the mic and say that?  Why is that a secret?  It's not a secret.  I was trying not to be in a room.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:00]  Why don't you hologram it in?  I will.  Oh, my God.  Can you write it out or do you put me?  Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.  And he actually put H-S-I-H, you know, code.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah.  Welcome.  Why don't you G-Y-Y-Y.  G-Y-Y screwed up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That'll, uh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch.  Yes, well.  Uh, who can blame you, though?  You're a little.  I'm frazzled up.  I'm sure you didn't sleep much last night after the coyote incident. 
[01:03:30]  I'm a survivor.  Yes, you are.  I feel like I'm coming out of a bad dream.  Celine Dion's going to sing a song for you later today, I think.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Harry Shearer joins the program next.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[01:04:00]  We still need a caller to, uh, describe wow to everybody out there.  We'll do that in a little while, but first we've got to say hi to Harry Shearer.  Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.  King and Harry.  One of many things Mr. Shearer has done with his fine, fine career.  That's him.  Hey, Harry, how are you, buddy?  Nice, how are you?  Good, what's up?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Thank you, my pleasure.  I always thought it would be a little odd to do, uh, radio with you because you, you 
[01:04:30]  parody it so well in various forms.  What do you mean?  What do you mean, baby?  I've seen certain things on the Simpsons and where it's always the wacky radio guys.  Oh, uh, yeah, we do, uh, oh, you know, I forget about Bill and Marty.  Yeah.  We don't do them very often.  Bill and Marty.  Bill and Marty.  Yeah.  And it's always the most hack radio.  It is.  Ever.  We actually try to.  It's so accurate.  We actually try to talk with our own voices.  We, we see that.  We try not to, you know, hack it up.  That's where, that's where you blaze a new trail. 
[01:05:00]  I, you know, actually, I don't think, uh, I think Bill and Marty are, are kind of, uh,  from the past.  I mean, I don't, you, as you go around the country, there's a lot that's wrong with radio.  But there's still a few of them out there.  Are there?  They're still doing it.  Yeah.  But you don't hear a lot of guys talking with that part of them.  Yes, yes, you do.  The boss jacks.  The boss jacks are the old days.  The one thing that really gets me, though, is it's always a light haired guy and a dark  haired, curly haired guy with a goatee.  And I'm like, fuck, man, maybe we ought to shave or something. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to, I'm going to dye my hair pink or something.  Just do something to make it not look like the stereotypes of, uh.  Just mess up the stereotypes of, uh.  The stereotypical, uh, radio guys.  Yeah, we, we mess with the, uh, the radio voices all the time.  And all the hacky bits that radio guys do.  Oh, man.  And, uh, you know, I, I grew up with a generation of them.  And they, uh, at, um, like, the station that was competing with KHJ in Los Angeles.  Always second, always, always not as good, KRLA.  And, uh, the first time I, I went in there and saw that these guys, the saddest thing  I saw was these guys weren't even listening to their own show on the air. 
[01:06:00]  They were listening to the competition.  It was so loud.  Oh, what's KHJ playing today?  Oh, okay, yeah.  What are they saying?  What are they saying in their 15 seconds where they can get to talk, you know?  That's right.  Radio guys in general are very paranoid.  Yeah.  So pathetic.  It is a weird business.  You did radio?  Oh, you know, I was with this group called The Credibility Gap, uh, David Lander and Michael  McKeon.  And we would come in every three hours and do these comedy newscasts and get so many  more listeners and so much more mail than the jocks that were doing their music shows. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, so the jocks must have loved that.  Loved that.  Loved that.  And, but, you know, so we were, we were doing these 10 minute comedy shows and, uh, pre-taping  them just before they go in the air, throwing the tapes down to the, from the production  studio to the air studio.  And very exciting and having a lot of fun and getting very high.  And, uh, and these jocks were just like, you know, machine tooled automatons, you know,  they could read their little, their little cards and keep their little clock going. 
[01:07:00]  And man, it was so fucking lame.  And, uh, the liner cards, the liner cards, don't forget to promote two for Tuesday.  Exactly.  Well, great.  And, uh, but, but listening, you know, they did.  And I said to him one day, Hey man, if you're not even listening to your own show, why do  you expect anybody else to?  No.  Sure.  They love hearing that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We didn't last long there.  Well, uh, got to ask you about what, um, one of your most popular roles, Derek Smalls.  Yes.  Yeah.  Did.  And you probably get asked this all the time, but I have to ask you, did you ever, did 
[01:07:30]  you ever think filming that one that it was going to be, you know, what is it now?  60 years later.  That people are still fascinated with the movie and musicians just take it on as their  own.  It's like, it's like a documentary for every band out there.  It's amazing.  And not just rock bands.  I have jazz guys and bluegrass guys and country guys who, and classical players who say, man,  we, we travel, we take that. 
[01:08:00]  It's the same dynamic.  It is.  You're dealing with a bunch of artistic people or some people that think they're artistic.  Quasi artistic.  Yeah.  And you have to work together.  Yeah.  And, uh, the, the, the conflicts that you're in, it, it hit it so on the head that, uh,  I was amazed that it wasn't an actual documentary.  Well, you know, some people who saw it originally before there was any promotion or understanding,  uh, would come up and say, why didn't they make that movie about a good band?  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  Thinking that it was a real documentary.  No, uh, the answer to, did you ever think is no, not in a million years.  And, and to show you how much we didn't think it was just such a miracle to get a, to get  the movie made and B to get it released.  Mm-hmm.  The company, uh, the company, uh, was run by Jerry Parencio.  Have you ever heard of him?  Former fight promoter, for starters, who went into partnership with Norman Lear for like  a minute and a half to run a soon-to-be-bankrupt movie company, which was the one that made  our film.  And Norman left to pursue Browner Pastures and, uh, and Jerry, we're left in the hands 
[01:09:00]  of Jerry, who didn't want to make the movie in the first place, and said, if the first  two critics who see this movie don't like it, it came out.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, that's how close it came to never being seen.  So we really, and he runs Univision now, the Mexican TV channel.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, he's, he's a piece of work.  You know, just to have a, a, a company where all your employees speak a language you don't  understand, which I guess is true. 
[01:09:30]  That could be a good thing.  That's every, every company in radio.  Yeah, exactly.  Where, where did the information come from?  Because that is, that, what's in that movie is information that you only get from being  in a touring rock band.  Yeah.  Uh, no matter if it's a small scale or a large scale, because I, we've, you know, all  done band things, and I, I was in a band for, for many years before I did radio.  Where'd you play?  I was a singer, and my brother was a guitarist, and there was always, I remember being in the studio  and hearing things like, you know, you can't play the fucking guitar.  You can't play the, like the arguments. 
[01:10:00]  And then there was the other guys that didn't have as much power going, oh shit, this is  all we fucking need.  That's right.  You know, and the, and the, the dynamic between, you know, the guy that has the power in the  band, and there's usually two guys at, at loggerheads all the time, and then, and  then the other guy, the guy that kind of sit back and take this shit.  You only get that by being in a band.  So who, who was the one that had that experience?  Well, Michael McKeon had been in a band called The Left Bank. 
[01:10:30]  They had done a hit called Walk Away Renee, and Pretty Ballerina was their follow-up that  was a semi-hit, and he joined the band right after they'd had their hits.  Fantastic.  Great timing.  Whoops.  Yeah.  And he and Chris had been in a band together as well, but that didn't, that didn't arise  a rise to that level of prominence, and then, you know, we'd been, Michael and I had been  in a comedy group that toured, so we had some of the same experiences except without having  to lug musical instruments along, and then we had, I was friends with the manager of 
[01:11:00]  The Grateful Dead, so I spent a lot of time around that.  And then our original keyboard player, we had hired this brilliant guy named, oh, I'm  going to blow his name, so I won't say it, had to leave because we couldn't get the movie  made, and he said, guys, I've got to take a gig, so he goes on the road with Uriah  Heap and comes back and, you know, tells us some stories.  Okay, that's a few stories.  Yeah, and so, you know, the whole thing was, what we wanted to do, we didn't want to make 
[01:11:30]  a movie about Spinal Tap, we started out wanting to make a movie that just got rock  and roll right, because we'd seen, we'd gotten so pissed off at seeing all these movies that  kept bullshitting about rock and roll, you know, right down to showing people playing  guitar who were doing impossible things that you weren't hearing, that was like, oh, come  on, doesn't anybody know what it looks like when you play a guitar?  We just thought, fuck, man, can't they get this right?  So, you know, that was our kind of, it wasn't something that we said as a motto or that 
[01:12:00]  we took an oath every morning like Japanese auto workers, it was just something that we  had in our minds, and so we never made anything up, you know, we just took stuff that we knew  and the stuff that people told us from that world and wove it together.  Well, like I said, just nailed it.  Did you ever hear the Eddie Van Halen rumor about when Van Halen sat down and watched it?  No, no.  Yeah, I heard this when the movie was released, that Van Halen sat down and watched it,  and everyone's laughing, and Eddie at one point turned around and said, this isn't fucking 
[01:12:30]  funny.  Which, like, says it all.  Well, you know, a lot of guys have said that to us.  I couldn't watch that fucking movie, man.  It was too close to my life, you know.  To this day, it's a great watch.  Yeah, it still holds up.  It definitely holds up.  And I met somebody, not Rob Halford, but somebody from Judas Priest, we were doing, the tail end  of all the rock bands doing, or music artists doing charity, all-star gigs, was a thing called  Here in Aid, done by heavy metal bands. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, right.  I remember that.  Yes, Here in Aid.  Here in Aid.  And they invited us, Michael and me, to the session, and so these guys were just, and  we thought, uh-oh, they're going to be pissed at us, because we made fun of them and made  them look like idiots, and they're just so thrilled.  You were rock stars to the rock stars.  We were rock stars to the rock stars.  And one guy, a priest, comes up and says, oh, man, it's such a great movie, and it's  like our lives.  I mean, last night we were in San Diego, I couldn't find my way to the fucking site.  Now, from an incredible high like that, and then I noticed, I remember, and just because 
[01:13:30]  of reading, you were part of the SNL cast during the not-too-popular years.  Which ones were those?  I wanted to ask you that.  No, I was there for the last year of the original cast, and then I came back with-  As a writer?  No, as a cast member who almost never got on the air.  You must have, yeah, I was just going to say, you must have really been a lot of characters.  Don't ask.  The last year of the original cast?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  It was Dan, sorry, Dan and John had left. 
[01:14:00]  So it was Gilda, Bill, Lorraine, Jane, Garrett, and me.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Some parties, huh?  Did you?  Yeah.  No kidding.  But weren't you then also with the transitional cast?  No.  You weren't with that?  No.  No, I left.  Kick me in the ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I thought you were in there with-  Gilbert Gottfried?  Like, Billy Crystal years or something.  I was there one year.  Ah-ha.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That was five years later.  It was Christopher Guest, Martin Short. 
[01:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  That's why I went.  There was also Jim Belushi and Billy Crystal, yes.  Yeah.  But that wasn't my problem.  Okay.  Well, it was my problem.  It wasn't my doing.  All right.  It must have been rough, though, after Belushi and Ackroyd left to try to keep that energy.  Listen.  That's tough to follow.  Drugs.  That place is, you know.  As Marty Short used to say, I walk in this building and I don't feel funny.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just so-  God, we hear that from so many of the guys that used to work there.  I know a lot of the cast members really have a hard, hard time bringing it up. 
[01:15:00]  Here's a clue.  It's not the architecture.  Okay.  All right.  A couple of issues with a few of the people.  Do you have any good times there?  Well, I mean, doing synchronized swimming was fun.  One of the classic picks of SNL.  That was fun.  Getting to know Marty, because I'd known him through Paul Schaefer, who was a friend of 
[01:15:30]  mine, but I'd never worked with him before.  And he's one of the good people in comedy.  How do we get to call him Marty?  Yeah.  We can only call him Martin.  Martin.  I always thought it was odd like that.  I'm Johnny Carson.  It goes back to Carson.  Yeah, years ago.  And it's like, hey, and Chuck Heston.  I was talking about Chuck Heston.  It's like, that's Charlton.  That's Charlton.  Chuck.  Who's Chuck Heston?  Chuck.  We don't have the privilege of calling him Chuck.  I have no stars that I can call by their common name.  Yeah, we can't call him Marty. 
[01:16:00]  Except Jimmy.  Jimmy actually, Robert De Niro was passing by and he wanted a picture.  And he put his hand on Robert De Niro's arm and went, Bob.  I called him Bob.  And got turned down so quickly.  This little creep.  I don't think it was the Bob.  I think it was the Breathe Right strip.  Yeah, it could have been.  I didn't have that on.  He asked me, I take a picture with him.  I say, you want to wear the strip or not?  And he says, oh yeah, I want to wear the strip.  It's amazing what they do with Photoshop.  They'll just take it out.  I don't know.  I have to because I had the rest of the show to do. 
[01:16:30]  If I was leaving, I would definitely take it off.  How many pictures do you have now with celebrities and your Breathe Right?  I only do that here.  And I'm obviously a couple.  I wouldn't have thought of it if I didn't say it.  So probably a couple that I'm not even aware of.  You're going for an endorsement deal.  Yeah, we're not aware of the Breathe Right.  He is.  He's going for an endorsement deal.  He's in every day with that.  Yeah, I always wear it.  I have to.  I have a bad nose.  How long have you been with The Simpsons now?  Since they started.  You were there right from the start.  17 years.  Yeah.  I think you guys are up to 17 years.  We're starting season 18 right now.  Wow.  Yeah.  How did you hook up with that?  That seems like.  Matt Groening was a fan of my radio show. 
[01:17:00]  I was a fan of this thing that he did, which was not the comic strip.  He did this wonderful column for one of the local alternative weeklies in the 80s, which  was called Record Mix.  The idea was that Matt was supposed to review records, but he didn't want to review records.  So he wrote this really funny column every week about what he did instead of reviewing  records.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  And it's like, you could only do that.  Yeah.  But he's a funny writer.  When did you realize that it wasn't going to be just another audition and it was gold?  Well. 
[01:17:30]  Because guys like you, you guys, you're going on a million things and some work, some  don't.  Well, yeah.  And this thing was just, when did you know?  I guess it's kind of caught on beginning of the, we did a short first season that started  in January.  And I mean, look, the Fox Network was a freaking joke back then.  Not to say that it's not a freaking joke now, but it's a big freaking joke.  Back then it was just a tiny little piece of crap.  Right.  And nobody thought that that was going to be around.  I mean, they had, every affiliate they had was, you know, a channel 50 or up. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  You know?  And they gave a lot of, I guess they didn't have much of a choice, but they gave a lot  of time to new shows back then.  Yeah.  They didn't have a choice.  Because they had no show to replace them.  Yeah.  I mean, if you look at the schedule that we were on with, the new adventures of Beans  Baxter, George C. Scott as Mr. President.  I mean, the shows that they had on that schedule with us were just like, come on, you know,  it's a joke schedule.  So, um, I think about the beginning of season two, we started to take off because there 
[01:18:30]  was so much, uh, criticism of us, you know, there were all these, uh, fundamentalists going  as a bad role model and the kid shouldn't watch the show.  And, and of course, because no one was doing that type of TV before the Simpsons.  That's right.  Now you got a lot of the adult, uh, cartoons that are hitting, you know.  Yeah.  You got South Park, which is far, far beyond us.  Yeah.  When did the focus switch from like Bart to, uh, Homer?  It seemed like Bart was intended to be the star of the show and then it became Homer.  That's a, that's a good question for a guy with a, uh, script. 
[01:19:00]  But if I didn't have this, you wouldn't have understood the question.  Uh, it would have been sniffling.  When do you think it happened?  I don't want to.  Do you think that, uh, I don't know.  I think it was a very subtle thing.  I mean, look, uh, we're not involved.  I'll tell you how deep, how deeply involved we are in the show.  The cast is involved in the show.  I started doing interviews this week here in New York to promote my CD and DVD.  And somebody asked me, hey, you guys just got, uh, signed up for season 18 and 19. 
[01:19:30]  And I said, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They put it out to Reuters before telling us.  Yeah.  So, you know, whatever decisions were being made about, uh, uh, whether it was Bart or Homer,  uh, was not revealed.  We didn't get the memo.  Let's put it that way.  You do that from home?  Or is it like an easiest gig ever?  No.  No.  No.  We have to go in.  At least drive into a studio.  Yeah.  Because believe me, I hear from some voice people.  Oh, sure.  It's like, I have my, uh, deers, uh, the-  ISDN.  Yeah, ISDN.  Oh, I have one of those for doing other stuff. 
[01:20:00]  I go into my den and-  Yeah.  The guy you hear in every city going, Channel 2 News at 5 does that in his pajamas from  his den.  Yeah.  You know that.  Today on Channel 2 News at 5, what you need to know before you go shopping for frozen food.  That guy is in his pajamas.  You know that.  Coyote in Central Park.  What could it mean for your children?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Some coyote food today.  I, uh, yeah, it's weird, you know, we, it's a great job.  We do go into the studio and do it together most of the time. 
[01:20:30]  Um, but it's-  Yeah, there's a genuine interaction between the characters.  Yes, yes, yes.  Maybe that's why it works out so well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, you got the DVD and the CD-  Oh, my God.  Yes, I do.  Yes.  Yeah.  You're releasing two things at once?  I know.  Are you crazy?  Am I nuts?  Uh, well, what I wanted to do was release them as a package.  And I found out, uh, that the record business has no package, no way of packaging something  that is a, a separate DVD and CD. 
[01:21:00]  You brought it up at a meeting and they just started pounding the table.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  They had no comprehension of-  No, I mean, I have, this is our company, so I, I just called the manufacturer and I said,  what do you, it's not a DVD of us playing the music that's on the CD.  It's not like that.  It's not a CD, uh, you know, it's not an enhanced CD ROM or something like that.  It's a real CD, comedy CD, that's completely different material from what's on the DVD.  And they said, well, we don't have any packaging for that. 
[01:21:30]  We don't know how to do that.  We don't know how to do that.  So I had to release them as two separate items.  You couldn't package it just as a double, in a double DVD to save yourself money on the  packing?  They don't know how to do that.  No, they told you.  They can put double CDs in there.  Yeah, but then you, how do you, how do you say on the package?  Right.  Yeah, how do you rack?  This is a whole other, a sticker that says, no, this is a whole other CD.  It's not like a CD of the stuff that's on the DVD, you know.  People won't know what they have.  That's right.  Why not release this and then six months later release this?  Wow.  I hate you.  You're boggling your mind here. 
[01:22:00]  No, look, the CD I want it out soon because it's about all the people from, all the anchors  in the TV news operations that have gone away in the last year and a half.  That's what, I was reading that and one thing close to my heart because I have done that  character on this program is the Tom Brokaw and that L, he just has a problem with it  and I can't get enough of watching him on television.  One of my favorites was a Leon Klinghoffer push from the deck of the Achille Laurel by 
[01:22:30]  Palestinian hijackers, the Italian cruise liner, Achille Laurel, leave us not forget.  Here's the weird thing.  They can't say they didn't know because he was anchoring local news on Channel 4 in Los  Angeles and his co-anchor was Kelly Lang. 
[01:23:00]  Kelly Lang.  He had to say fucking Kelly Lang and I will be back at 11.  Every day.  What were they thinking?  No, let's bring him to the White House.  I like the kid of his gym.  One of the most successful news anchors ever with a system.  You would think they would have just changed her name.  No, but I mean, why not?  People change their name all the time.  The job entails L's.  You have to say L's. 
[01:23:30]  All he has to do is pronounce 26 letters in the alphabet and he's 25, 26th of the way there.  You know, it's not a complicated job.  Do you think he went to a speech pathologist behind the scenes just trying to figure out  that L?  If he did, it all didn't matter more.  It did get worse as the news went on.  It got way worse, man.  If he went to a speech pathologist, he said to him, here's the trick.  Just have a mouthful of oatmeal when you go in there. 
[01:24:00]  They won't notice the L's.  Well, it worked out for him.  Yeah, it did.  So it's all those folks.  It's Dan, Tom, Barbara Walters, Ted Koppel, who gets the first cut on the CD as Mickey Mouse  cuts him a new one in a meeting.  And then he later on shows up in the show.  He would have done it.  He stayed with ABC, which is sort of they smush his format together with Dave Letterman.  So he's got Paul Schaefer as his band leader.  And he gets to do interviews with, you know, like Dr. Zbignett, Brzezinski, but Brzezinski  keeps getting dumped in a tub of oatmeal during the interview because it's stupid professor 
[01:24:30]  tricks.  It's called Harry Shearer Dropping Anchors.  I see a cut on here.  If JFK had lived.  After Tom Brokaw, invest the drama.  Invest the drama.  At NBC News, invest the drama.  I love the sarcasm with the news, man.  We touch on it all the time here.  We do a segment just where we play news teasers and the fear mongering that they try to.  And they can't let you know in the teaser what the problem is. 
[01:25:00]  Of course not.  They got to because it's all about roping you in to watch the news broadcast.  So it's like your children are playing with a toy right now that could kill them.  We'll tell you at 11.  Tell me now.  Now, yeah.  Can your car kill you?  I got to go to the store.  I got to leave now.  We got the best news tease ever.  Listen to this really fast.  That's quick.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  What?  Get out of here.  Uh-oh. 
[01:25:30]  Now I got what?  But wait, my kids are walking this.  I...  Exactly.  Now, if you really, if you really think about it, that cannot happen.  Yeah.  What politician?  All sex offenders in my area here.  I'll take them.  I'll take them.  I'll take them.  I'll bring them in.  We know what to do with them in the sixth ward.  Yeah.  That's...  It's not happening.  Yeah.  Get away with that.  The other one I hate is, here's what we're working on for tomorrow.  Well, if you know what it's going to be tomorrow, tell me fucking today.  We're working on it.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Work it.  Don't work on it.  Tell me.  It seems to be done and ready to go.  I love it.  It really is just, it's entertainment.  It's about rating.  It's no longer the desk.  We can't get enough of it.  I used to...  We mock it all the time on this program.  When I grew up, it was the...  You know, and because they didn't have all the graphics and fancy equipment they have now,  but it was a desk and a clock.  Yep.  And the guy telling you what the hell was going on, period.  Yeah.  Now, it's got to be, you know, the attention span of a gnat.  Everything's got to be flashy, and you've got to throw graphics at everybody. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, and of course, that's why they had to get rid of Aaron Brown, because he just moved  too slowly in the modern age.  People don't want to hear that.  People don't want to see tomorrow's papers tonight.  No.  They want to see tomorrow's promos tonight.  You ever read the ticker so long that you get up and spin around and hit the floor?  I've gotten up and thought I had a tumor, because I'd be reading the ticker, and then you  get up and everything in your room starts going the opposite way that the ticker went?  You know what you have to do?  Watch Al Jazeera to get yourself... 
[01:27:00]  To get it going the other way?  That's right.  I was doing a headstand a half hour before I stopped watching the ticker just so it would  go the other way.  Here's the weird thing that I only realized when I talked to one of these people, like  I met one in Atlanta or something.  Those are jobs.  Yeah.  What's your job?  I write the ticker at the bottom of the CNN thing, and they spend eight hours sitting  and typing that.  Just typing away?  Yeah.  That's a job now.  That's a job.  Thanks to 9-11.  Yeah.  There wasn't a ticker before 9-11.  It wasn't.  Now it's needed. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  It's not...  Also, the Fox News alert.  Make a lot of fun of that.  When it first started...  Uh-oh.  When I hear that in the background...  This is a Fox News alert.  I trip over my own ass to try to see what was happening.  To get to a TV.  Because last time I heard it, buildings were falling down.  Yeah, yeah.  So perhaps it's important.  And now it's...  Traffic on the FDR.  What?  Yeah.  I know.  It's there every day.  Yeah.  It's all about fear-mongering, panicking.  They made a sound that now scares you. 
[01:28:00]  You're like Pavlov's dog getting petrified at sounders.  That's right.  And then, you know, when they actually start telling you stuff, thank you.  This generation, we thought, couldn't get sillier than these pompous assholes who were, you know, pretending that they knew stuff that they didn't.  You know, they just sat and read prompters.  And if they weren't reading prompters, they'd put on a safari jacket, fly 10,000 miles, ask the crew, what's the mood here?  And then do a special.  We thought it couldn't get worse than that.  And now there's this Anderson Cooper who doesn't know shit but just feels the news better than you do. 
[01:28:30]  And he looks the part.  Yeah.  He's prematurely gray.  Yeah.  The women love him.  The women love him.  Well, they wore his mama's jeans.  Anderson, I wore your mama's jeans.  That's right.  And he'll just go to the location of the hurricane and talk to some locals.  But it's just about feelings.  It's like he's the male Oprah, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's just.  Well, it's all about hurricanes and shark attacks now, too.  Well, the shark attacks.  We have a lot of fun with the shark attacks. 
[01:29:00]  And the hurricane coverage is just out of control.  And the bird flu.  And the bird flu.  Very scared.  Very petrified.  Do you know almost 100 people worldwide have died of the bird flu?  I know.  It's a pandemic.  Listen, if I were a chicken, I'd be very scared right now.  Right.  Be petrified.  Yeah, I'd be very afraid.  There's some news that has him running around the hen house just scared shitless.  Well, the CD looks good.  It's called Dropping Anchors.  So that's one project.  That's one project.  That is completely different than the DVD.  That's correct.  Now, move on to the newer, different project.  We don't want to confuse the listeners.  This should have came out six months from now, but he has decided. 
[01:29:30]  I ought to.  I ought to.  If you release a CD and a DVD, you do know that if you release one, normally DVDs should  come first.  And then if you release a CD within five or six months after it, it probably sells 60% to 70% better.  Hey, it'll be there in the stores.  I'm not going to take marketing advice from a guy with a strip on his fucking nose.  Although he's marketing a strip very well.  It's going to say Nike across that or something soon.  Product placement with Jimmy Norton.  The DVD's called Now You See It. 
[01:30:00]  What's this about, Harry?  That's all my stuff from, it's not all my stuff, but it's the stuff I like best from SNL and  my HBO specials and a couple of things that have never been seen before because there  were some assholes at NBC.  Great.  Harry.  Oh, some of the, what?  Some of the bits that never made air or something?  Yeah, one.  In particular, I did a show, a really stupid fucking show that was Brandon Tartikoff, the  great dead genius of NBC.  Not that smart.  Punky Brewster, ladies and gentlemen.  Super Train, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, Super Train.  Super Train.  Yeah.  It's like the love boat on rails.  On rails?  How can it lose?  How can it lose?  Oh, I don't even remember.  Super Train.  Super Train.  It was a Super Train.  How can you not get the concept?  Guests are from a series of the time, joining in and falling in love and having problems  with their families and the setting of a train.  Where were they going on the train?  Nowhere.  Nowhere, just like the show.  Just like the show.  So this genius comes up with, you know, hey, we're losing every Sunday night at 7 to 60 minutes. 
[01:31:00]  We can't counter-program 60 minutes.  Nobody will watch anything we put on.  So let's really put on nothing.  And he came up with a show called Sunday Best, which was, let's take good stuff that's been  on during the week and repackage it and have Carl Reiner host it.  And then somebody said, Brandon, the affiliates won't carry that.  You have to have something original.  So he hired Merrill, Marco, and me to do original pieces for the show, mixed with all this crap.  And then, I can't even remember the guy's name. 
[01:31:30]  The guy who runs the WB network now.  Ben Sparks?  No.  Ben Sparks?  Ben Sparks.  It's not Ben Sparks.  He doesn't run anything in television.  He's the right guy.  But good with a name.  Anyway, he runs the show.  And I do this piece, which I really liked, which was somehow Richard Nixon finds himself  in the middle of an infomercial for a magical product that cleans your teeth and takes stains  off your clothing.  And it's the best Nixon I ever did.  The makeup is amazing. 
[01:32:00]  And the guy just refuses to run it.  And the show dies anyway.  But so I had that piece, and I thought, I want people to see that.  So that's on there, too.  Very cool, yeah.  But synchronized swimming, and Mike Wallace would make the novelties, and my David Copperfield  meets...  Wait, that was you as Mike Wallace?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck, man.  They show their comedy club, The Stress Factory, in Jersey.  Before the show, a lot of times they'll show old SNL clips.  They show the synchronized swimming, and that Mike Wallace is with the whoopee cushions,  right?  Yeah.  That is a funny fucking bit, man.  Thank you. 
[01:32:30]  I didn't know that was you.  God damn, that's good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That's the idea.  It's like, a lot of stuff I've done, people didn't know it was me, because I look different,  so...  You know, I was in Vegas recently, and I decided to go old school and go see David Copperfield.  Yeah.  The first 20 minutes of the show was clips about him.  Yeah.  Of course.  From every TV show that mentioned him.  So you're saying he made your money disappear.  Oh, Mike.  It was, I have to say, it was god-awful.  But the first 20 minutes was just a montage of every show saying, what are you, David Copperfield?  Over and over, and then all his press clippings. 
[01:33:00]  But he makes the money disappear, but without that byproduct of entertaining.  That's correct.  That's the magic.  Yeah, that's the magic.  Anyone can make your money disappear, but then you get some entertainment back.  He didn't have anything of me doing him, right?  Absolutely he did.  He did?  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  He had me?  Whoever mentioned...  I'm suing this fucking asshole.  Whoever mentioned David Copperfield, it was everything from Friends to, I believe, The  Simpsons to every show.  Oh, my God.  It was just one after another just saying, what are you, David Copperfield?  David Copperfield. 
[01:33:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Just feeding his own ego.  Super montage.  I was so disappointed.  The year before, I saw Cirque du Soleil, and I went from that to David Copperfield this  year.  What are you doing?  You want to do something good for yourself the next time you go to Vegas?  See Rickles.  He's still great.  I love Don Rickles.  Oh, man.  Absolutely.  One of my faves.  I saw the last two minutes of him.  I was working with a guy named Jim Florentine and Dice.  We were doing a late, nasty show at the Stardust, and it was Rickles and Harvey Korman were  on the early show.  But we couldn't...  No, I'm sorry.  It was Tim Conway and Harvey Korman.  Rickles was there another time on the early show. 
[01:34:00]  I saw it the last five minutes.  So this really has nothing to do with what we were talking about.  No, but I said Rickles.  You turned it into Rickles, and then Rickles wasn't even in the...  How did you do that?  I'll tell you how.  That's the magic.  I had two different fantastic stories.  Because I just understand, I was involved in an animal attack last night.  You were not coyote.  Jimmy had a run for his life from a coyote last night, so he's not...  He's completely with us today.  Yeah, it was like I lose the children like I was...  He's a little distracted.  Maybe you should have brought in the coyote to tell the story.  No, I had one incident with Rickles.  Did he have a helicopter backpack and was trying to drop some type of weight on your head? 
[01:34:30]  Well, I guess nobody wants to hear the story, but it's a gem and it's everyone's loss.  Oh, man.  He's put us in our place, hasn't he?  I think we'll make it.  We'll pull through anyway.  But Rickles, I saw him a year ago.  John Landis, who's French with Rickles, said,  You gotta come see Rickles in Vegas.  You gotta come see...  Yeah, I've done it.  But I mean, he's just amazing.  He's still doing it, huh?  He's fucking amazing.  And he's like prowling the stage like a jaguar, you know?  He's the best at that sarcastic humor.  Oh, my God.  How many years? 
[01:35:00]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God.  Well, he started, you know, in the 50s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you did.  Yeah, way back in the 50s.  I remember.  I remember.  Spitting the hot wax, as they called it back then.  But you see him on stage and you just kind of...  I was in Vegas a couple years ago, saw him and saw Keeley Smith and Sam Butera,  and you just think, oh, fuck, Sinatra's gonna be standing at the door watching this,  you know, before you know it.  But no.  No, he's still dead.  And instead... 
[01:35:30]  Nothing worse than when you're waiting for the dead guy to walk in on the show  and he's like, fuck, that never happens.  That show's over, he's not here.  All right.  But now you read, I read the story in Vegas, they have to, a lot of the acts now have to  pay to play showrooms.  Wow.  They have to rent the showroom, hire the musicians.  Make their own money from ticket sales?  Yeah.  And do their own promotion.  That's like what happened with shit bands, like, around Long Island.  Yeah.  You used to have to sell your own tickets.  Yeah.  Now they're doing it to your friends.  Now they're doing it on the strip in Vegas.  Wonderful.  Goulet was at the Venetian room and couldn't make it because he was like, that's what he 
[01:36:00]  was doing there.  Oh, God.  And not the Venetian room, the Venetian hotel.  And it's like, the Venetian?  Are you kidding me?  They have to have a guy pay to play in the showroom at the Venetian?  Wow.  Isn't that amazing?  Harry, they're telling us you have to go.  They're telling us you have to go.  I wanted to hear Jimmy's story.  We all did.  It's just fun.  There's a lot of laughs in it and a few tears, but next time.  Well, we've had the tears.  Don't tear up your breather.  Let's get the plugs out.  The DVD is out.  It's called Now You See It.  And there's a CD out, which is completely different from the DVD, called Harry Shear 
[01:36:30]  Dropping Anchors, right?  Yep.  And anything else you want to promote today?  Simpsons and all that fun stuff.  Oh, everybody.  Simpsons can promote themselves.  They're going to watch it.  Yeah, they're going to watch it.  Exactly.  I want to sign DVD.  That Mike Wallace bit is fucking hilarious.  Thank you.  I had no idea that was you.  That really is funny.  Well, thank you, Jimmy.  Harry.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  We'll look into that for you.  All right.  Thank you, Harry.  Pleasure.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit.  Get us out of here for a little while, Derek. 
[01:37:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Let's pick it.  And whip them out Wednesday.  Someone describe a wow for everybody, please.  Please.  It's, um...  No, not you, Jimmy.  I'm good at it.  No, you're not.  I give good descriptions.  In high school, I was voted most likely to give an accurate description.  You're still not yourself from the big coyote experience that you had last night.  I'm like Jeff Bridges in Fearless.  I'm just challenging everything new. 
[01:37:30]  I'm unafraid because I've survived that.  I like that reference, by the way.  Nice.  All right.  Harry Shearer was a lot of fun.  Oh, did I get him when he left?  Did you?  Well, you forgot something.  Oh.  Yeah, all the way back.  You forgot something and then we watched him come all the way back.  It was frightening to watch.  All right.  Hey, we were talking about news teases during that last segment with Harry.  Yeah.  And we got brand new news teases.  Look how this works.  Sometimes it just works out for us.  Look at us now.  Look at us now. 
[01:38:00]  Thanks, doll.  Look at us now.  Two days before vacation.  Look what we do now.  Look what we do.  So we got brand new news teases.  Also, we have...  I want to play the leprechaun sighting thing again.  Remind me to play this before we get out of here, please.  And what else?  Josh Elliott is here.  That's Josh Elliott.  Yeah.  And?  Or is that Josh Elliott?  Or is that Josh Elliott?  You or... 
[01:38:30]  Is that him or you?  It's you?  It's you.  Okay.  We're going to say hi to Josh Elliott in a little bit here.  But first, we've got to get through these news teases, okay?  Right.  All right.  And also, some other things on the way.  Oh, the setup car, Anthony.  We got that audio for you.  Oh, goody.  I love setup car.  And we got American Idol crap.  And we also have Guess the Sound today.  It's like a regular radio show in here.  We're trying.  We try harder every day.  Coyote Story.  Oh, my God.  Oh, right now. 
[01:39:00]  Right now, you need the Coyote?  Remove whatever you have in that disc player.  All right.  And put in Coyote Story, because this concerns Jimmy Norton.  For the rest of America...  And his safety.  For the rest of America, we're living in total fear here in Manhattan today.  Very scary day here in Manhattan.  A coyote is loose.  Loose!  In Central Park.  What could it do?  Why aren't we in Central Park trying to get the coyote?  It could rip us to pieces.  We could be heroes.  Send out Bill.  Send Bill to go find the coyote?  Send Bill with a spear. 
[01:39:30]  I want him to spear the coyote.  Can we send our own platoon into Central Park?  Everyone else is.  Find a coyote.  This is like Jaws.  Yeah, come on.  There's real groups forming all over Manhattan to find the coyote, because they know they  would be big heroes.  If you get this coyote, you're on the news.  I'm not even kidding.  Can we send a platoon?  Do we have little weapons they could...  Use the Darth Vader mask.  What the hell is that going to do?  Might as well take the monkey head.  And the monkey head.  That'll help.  I'm not even kidding.  We should go... 
[01:40:00]  A few O&A signs for an assault on the media?  No?  Oops.  Well, can maybe somebody...  We should send our own platoon into Central Park to find the coyote.  Can somebody actually go down there and run out and do some acting and tell the media,  we saw the coyote, I know the coyote, and then when they start talking to you, you drop  an O&A bomb.  Can't somebody do that?  Yeah, we can do that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  We're not allowed to do the assault on the media thing anymore, because we like our  jobs, but...  That's not an assault on the media.  That's not an assault on the media.  Exactly.  Elo has 10 minutes.  We got a coyote freaking news story. 
[01:40:30]  Elo has 10 minutes.  What the hell do we do?  What could Elo possibly be doing that he only has 10 minutes for us now?  We're in a major panic.  I thought we were a priority.  We don't know what to do now.  Do we play the coyote news story?  Do we go to Elo?  Do we do the news teases, or do we say hi to Josh Elliott?  We got to go to Elo.  Really?  Yeah.  Elo.  I'll move my media and keep going with the coyote stuff.  It's gripping, gripping radio.  Elo.  Hey, buddy.  Elo, before we get into anything, anybody talk to you about that thing? 
[01:41:00]  About the what?  About that thing.  Yeah, the thing's going...  You know the thing with the other guy?  The thing is going down again.  Oh, I got a phone call this morning about the thing.  All right.  What are we looking at here?  The thing?  The thing.  Does it look good?  All I know about the thing is that the thing has gotten a little softer, to use a...  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, but I want to know, because we're kind of into doing the thing.  Yeah.  No, I think the thing's interesting, but I think the thing's got a...  The thing has a new layer of hair from...  I mean, I don't know...  Yeah, yeah, I know. 
[01:41:30]  It's kind of a new thing thing.  Oh, my God.  There's a guy on a bike chasing a coyote in Central Park.  Holy shit.  Hold on, Elo.  Early this morning, around 7 o'clock, there were reports of two sightings, both of them  right here near the Wallman Rink.  For a while, police had this coyote cornered in an area between the rink and Central Park  South.  They were slowly surrounding this.  The plan was to tranquilize the coyote and then transport him out of Central Park.  Now, as wily, forgive the pun, as wily as the coyote may be, what he did was he swam 
[01:42:00]  across a pond under a bridge, actually cut through the grounds of the Wallman Rink itself  and has now escaped north into the vast expanses of Central Park once again.  So the hunt continues once again.  A reminder, the coyote doesn't pose a threat to humans.  However, they do remind you to keep your dogs on a leash if you're in Central Park.  Oh, shut up.  On your live over Central Park, John DelGiorno, Channel 7, Eyewitness News.  Breaking news.  Coyotes.  Keep a close eye on this.  Thank you, John.  We'll keep a close eye.  For the morning commute, Jeff. 
[01:42:30]  Fucking awful woman of indiscriminate race.  Yeah, you don't even know what's...  Yeah, she's awful.  She could be black, but she could be Indian.  She's been working in a chocolate factory.  And she has a little Italian to her, too.  A little something.  Who knows?  It was a pillaging 500 years ago.  Well, Elo, we kind of want to do the thing, so let's talk.  Yeah, I just found out about the thing this morning.  I talked to the person and a possible rep and confabbed with our people about the thing,  and the thing's got a little more hair on it, but we've got to figure it out.  Let's figure out the thing.  The thing is back on track?  I don't know back on track, certainly. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, boy.  The thing ain't happening.  The thing ain't happening.  This is corporate crap.  Because I'm hearing now...  When corporate guys use words like interesting, ah.  I know.  The thing is no thing.  It's just what it is.  I'm hearing the thing is more...  I've already heard about it.  Honestly, I just heard about the thing 45 minutes ago.  I'm hearing that the thing, the chance of the thing happening now rests more on people we know.  Like us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I said, I'm trying to understand exactly what the thing is. 
[01:43:30]  Don't get in our way, Elo.  You guys know I would never do that.  We've got some creative people.  Let's try to figure out the thing.  Yeah.  We'll figure out the thing.  Let's try to figure out the thing.  All right.  We're done with the thing.  Now let's talk about the other thing that you're here to talk about.  Well, first of all, I posted...  I don't know if you saw the email.  I actually posted on WackFan.  By the way, this just came in.  You posted on WackFan?  Yeah.  By the way, this just came in.  Opie Coyote can't be black because it swam.  Oh.  You know, you take the stereotypes.  That was Sean from Pennsylvania.  Stop it.  Not me.  I'm sorry. 
[01:44:00]  But this is breaking news.  Elo is now posting on WackFan.  On WackFan.  Elo is a pest.  Yes.  Jesus.  Yeah, I did.  It was late.  I posted last night.  I sported.  Wait, can we find Elo's post?  Where's your post?  And then I want the comments afterwards.  Did you post a new topic?  No, it was under the Elo rumor thing.  Right.  Elo's got his own thread.  Like, they speculate about Elo.  Elo speculation threads.  Yeah, that's been going on for months.  I tried to get my own screen name because it's so...  That website is so jacked up you can't even get a screen name. 
[01:44:30]  No.  I tried to get Elo, which...  Oh, stop.  There are 20 Elos.  You can't have your own name.  Are you trying to explain why you showed up on a Dateline NBC special?  I was trying to post on WackFan.  Why I'm meeting girls on park benches?  You talked about sex.  So I had to come up with a...  I sat there and spent 20 minutes trying to come up with a name because I couldn't have  Elo.  Oh, my God.  What's your name on freaking WackBag?  It's embarrassing.  What is it?  Hold on.  Well, I tried the comedy route. 
[01:45:00]  I tried something with hair and bowl cut.  Those were all taken.  So...  Yeah.  Did you try Elo with a zero instead of an O?  No.  I just put the real and capitalized real.  Put the real Elo.  Oh, you're the real Elo.  Yeah.  All right.  And here's his post.  Let me read it for everybody.  Okay.  First, let me tell you that I have never posted on a board before, so this is odd.  However, this thread caught my eye.  I will call in tomorrow to the show with more information, assuming that Opie lets me on  the air and doesn't A, hang up on me, and B, doesn't run my haircut into the ground. 
[01:45:30]  That's Jimmy's bit.  I didn't say anything about it.  What's wrong with his haircut?  Hopefully, my news will bring joy to many of the whack beggars.  I guess that is what you call these people, Elo.  Look at Elo trying to fit in.  That's cute.  I'm trying to use the vernacular, as we'd say.  Elo, were you jacking off on Pal Talk last night?  I was in my basement most of the night, so yeah.  Okay.  Just wondering.  All right, Elo.  What do you got for us today?  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:46:00]  I said that we'd have a big announcement.  Thursday morning, you guys will be able to break the seal on something that you guys  have been hammering me on, pushing me to do, and begging me for.  So Thursday morning, right before you guys leave for vacation, give me a buzz, and we'll  be able to crack the seal on this thing.  Wait.  Wait.  You're announcing an announcement?  Yeah.  It's the old radio bit.  Come on now.  Jesus Christ.  We don't need to tease.  We don't need to work on time spent listening, you silly goose.  You called with a tease?  On satellite radio, you just tell the info. 
[01:46:30]  Well, you know, I did it so I can play on the thread some more.  I wanted to get some more speculation on the thread.  He really is a pest.  I'm being fired.  God only hopes.  No.  Wait a minute.  It's something people are psyched about.  It's what we've asked for.  Remember when I was in the studio and I wrote it down on a piece of paper?  Yep.  I remember what it is.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  And why can't it be announced right now?  What's standing in the way?  We've got one little attorney thing hurdle to clear.  Oh, lawyers are so entertaining. 
[01:47:00]  Yes, they are.  Speaking of lawyers.  Oh, I can't do it.  My brother's here.  Oh, you're stealing his bit.  I said that I was stealing my brother's bit, but now my brother's here.  Yeah, but then you're accusing Jimmy of stealing your bit.  That's why I stole his bit.  No.  Jimmy's stealing my bit.  Speaking of stealing bits.  That I stole from my brother.  No, I stole your brother's bit.  I just bridged it with you.  All right.  It was his bit.  Maybe my brother will do the Samantha bit today for everybody.  So on Thursday, we can break this.  Thursday, you can call me.  We can break it. 
[01:47:30]  What's it rhyme with?  Hair.  No, it does not.  Oh, okay.  It rhymes with subtle.  Would you shut up?  Wait.  Metal.  No.  No.  Metal.  That would be too obvious.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Wait.  Hilo's going to go, I got to go now.  Kettle.  Kettle.  Kettle.  Kettle one is what I was drinking last night.  Yep.  There you go.  Liquid kettle.  Liquid kettle one is what I was drinking.  Hansel and Gretel, we're going to eat children. 
[01:48:00]  You came here under the pretext.  Are you a gingerbread house?  Oh, the gingerbread house.  Let me read your transcript.  I want to eat children.  Are you going to have more announcements tomorrow?  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  For you guys?  Yeah.  Potentially.  Talk about the thing to people.  I got to go work out the thing.  I got to go upstairs.  Talk about the thing to people.  Make it work.  Instead of finding ways to make something not work, Hilo, make it work. 
[01:48:30]  See the bucket that says things that work?  I am all about things that work.  Let's fill that bucket up.  I am the can-do guy.  I know you are.  You've proven yourself as that.  You're going to have more goddamn lights in your studio.  You know what to do with when you get back from vacation, by the way.  Yes.  We're going to be blinded by the light.  No.  I mean, you'll be able to see the lights from the moon.  That's great.  But if it's light in here.  Hey, is it true we're also doing our first project with Steve Kingston?  Yes, you are.  A guy we hated for many, many years. 
[01:49:00]  The Arch Enemy.  Yes.  We're doing our first project with Steve Kingston.  Yeah.  This is exciting.  I read the email.  He should have helped us out with five, six years ago.  Why should he have?  He was the scumbag.  What's the first project with Steve Kingston?  Can we announce this?  Do we have details in front of us?  I don't have the details in front of me.  I know it's been – I know the term I heard yesterday in my meeting was 99.9% done.  But it has to do with an up-and-coming concert.  There were other things that were 99.9% done. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  It's called The Thing.  Yeah, The Thing was 99.9% done.  What, is Kingston checking with Howard to make sure he doesn't piss off Howard too much?  Is that the last 0.1% we're waiting for?  No, I think – I mean, actually, I do think it's done.  Okay.  I do think it's done.  I have a question.  You might know this.  There was somebody else at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction from XM in the press room.  Is there any way we can find out who that was?  The one at the –  Recently, yes.  Male or female?  Male.  And he had a woman with him, actually. 
[01:50:00]  I think there was one or two.  Was it somebody from – was it – who – I mean, what did they look like?  Tall.  Pretty tall guy.  I mean –  Handsome, Jimmy?  Yeah, he was a good-looking guy.  Yeah, good-looking.  Nice hog?  I wouldn't know.  I'm a lack of trying.  There was somebody else there and a woman he was with, and they said they have audio from that whole thing.  Well, I didn't set anybody up because we have a no – you know, I'm controlling expenses, as you know.  Ah.  Well, I want to thank Elo for – what? 
[01:50:30]  I don't know.  For announcing the pending announcement.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  And for promising to talk to the people that need to be talked about about the thing.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Anthony, you're going to be on a boat next week, right?  Yes, but I have a satellite phone.  He does, too.  I have a sat phone that I am available all the time.  Well, I need a number.  I will check in with you because I would have to leave the sat phone on and on my patio.  I'm on my deck.  So I will be checking in with Elo on my satellite phone. 
[01:51:00]  We're going to be reading about Anthony's vacation on Greta Van Susteren or something.  Hey, that's funny.  I will be in Aruva, I do believe.  Yeah, it's going to be seven weeks about somebody who's missing off a boat.  Why doesn't everyone have satellite phones?  Do you know if there's an emergency and all cell phone goes down, I will be able to call someone as long as they have a satellite phone?  And what are they going to do?  Anthony, I've got three of them orbiting the planet right now.  I'm good.  I know.  Rock, roll, and what's the other one called?  Rhythm.  Rhythm.  And we've got blues getting ready to go up.  What about Opie and Anthony?  Why don't we promise the satellites were going to be called Opie and Anthony? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, remember they promised us that they were actually going to rename the satellites Opie and Anthony.  They promised us that with the national TV spot.  Isn't that almost literally promising us the moon?  It's a satellite orbiting the Earth.  And just to feed our egos, they were going to have pictures of us on the satellite.  Remember all that?  They were going to fly us up to the satellites to hit the on button on the shuttle.  I remember.  Actually, they wanted us to launch the shuttles.  Yeah, they wanted us to hit the actual launch button.  Yeah, whatever it would be.  It would have been a disaster.  Remember all that hogwash before ELO joined XM? 
[01:52:00]  Hogwash?  Opie, could you use a term from at least the 1900s?  Yeah, remember that bullshit?  That's okay, ELO.  Make the thing work.  Listen, I'm hanging up so I can work on it.  And Opie, you're going to be in the Caribbean, right?  Yeah, but he's got smoke signals.  Opie will be signaling you.  I've got to know if I'm working on this thing, and then how do I find you guys?  I'll be in New York.  I can take care of everything.  I have long negotiation power.  You just talked to me.  Power of attorney.  I now give it over to Jimmy Norden. 
[01:52:30]  I'll take care of things.  My house will be gone.  I'll work it out.  Everything will be sold.  All right, I'm going to go work on this thing and go release more coyotes in Central Park.  Thank you, ELO.  All right, I'm going back to whack bag.  Goodbye.  Do you think that...  He wasn't falling for it.  I love how the slam is hard.  He really slams it down now.  I love it.  It's, yo, I've hung up and you did not fool me.  You didn't get me.  But he's doing the hesitation, though.  It doesn't take eight seconds to get the phone to you and the cradle.  So, he stopped and he went,  All right, all right, all right. 
[01:53:00]  Is it really?  All right, here we go.  So, here's the coyote story.  We need all news reports about the coyote.  Please.  A coyote on the loose in Central Park.  We sent our coyote, our lone dog out there.  You know, Phoenix is called.  Look at him.  He's already...  You already howled at the moon.  You don't sleep anyway.  This is...  Oh, you're...  Are you listening to me when I'm checking in?  Uh-huh.  You are.  So, I gotta watch what I say beforehand.  What the fuck is this?  What is that awful banter?  And why was he laughing? 
[01:53:30]  You don't sleep anyway.  Ha, ha, ha.  Why are you howling at the moon?  What's funny about that ever?  Nothing, Jimmy.  Nothing.  They're just having so much fun with this coyote today.  Assholes.  It's a feel-good story in a weird way.  All right, so I gotta watch what I say beforehand.  Yeah, right.  Good morning, guys, and good morning, everyone.  This is all all-fair stuff that no one understands right now.  Just suffice to say, I am now thoroughly embarrassed.  Okay, well, here's the deal.  We're on the Upper East Side Central Park here.  And Parks Commissioner Mark Benepe yesterday was with some park officials. 
[01:54:00]  He happened to spot this coyote.  And so he knows what these things look like.  And he says it definitely was a coyote.  It's about the size of a German shepherd.  And by the way, you can pronounce it either coyote or coyote.  Either one is correct.  And they call it HAL because it was first spotted by the HAL at Nature Sanctuary about 2.30 yesterday afternoon.  That's by the pond on East 59th Street.  Now, they are concerned, Adrian Benepe is the Parks Commissioner,  because these coyotes, first of all, do attack dogs and small animals.  It already is believed has been eating some ducks in the park. 
[01:54:30]  And also, they're not sure if this thing is rabbit or not.  So they want to make sure the people are safe.  They believe it came down from Westchester County, literally coming right through the Bronx and over a bridge into Manhattan.  And then it ended up here in Central Park.  Probably because it could mix in among the wildlife here and not be seen.  Not that it gave it much thought, but it's more of the natural habitat that it's used to.  But this is, again, a pretty good concern.  Yesterday, both parks officials and police scoured the area looking for the coyote,  trying to tranquilize it if they find it.  That's it.  From here, we're live on the Upper East Side at Central Park, Ken Rosado, Channel 7, I would say. 
[01:55:00]  So his name's HAL.  HAL, that's the nickname of him, yes.  Okay.  You see a coyote named HAL.  Way to reiterate.  Yeah, that helped the story.  Because it's going to...  HAL.  It'll come running when you call its name.  He thought a funny thought was going to show up, and nothing happened.  Ah, his name is HAL.  Blank.  Blank.  Douche.  Is that Steve Bartlestein?  Yeah, good old Steve Bartlestein.  Why don't you shine a little red fucking flasher into his eyes? 
[01:55:30]  Crystal meth, you douche.  Hey, you want to get Josh Elliott in here?  We'll do news teases.  Certainly.  Can I have another cup of water, please?  Because there's no bottled water.  Holy fucking shit.  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  That's just a cup of water?  Yeah.  Love that.  What's going on?  I don't know.  They're showing a cruise missile launch, and it's just fantastic.  You know, I don't mind paying taxes so much when they show things like cruise missiles.  Uh-oh. 
[01:56:00]  He's walking around to shake people's hands.  Sir, how you doing?  Josh Elliott, everyone, from ESPN, right?  Yeah.  ESPN Classic.  Classic.  Classic.  I watched the ESPN Classic.  It's pretty cool.  That's a great idea.  I like it.  I watched some of the old Wide World of Sports on that.  What's amazing, they bought...  Microphone.  Yeah, when did you start broadcasting?  Come on.  Microphone, sir.  We got microphones.  That's right.  This thing never stops, does it?  Yeah.  Jump in.  I know.  Jump on, jump on.  Jump in.  It's not only radio.  It is.  It's like an old freight train to hobos. 
[01:56:30]  It never stops circling the air.  No.  I can't tell you how many guests actually ask us, are we on the air?  I don't know if that's good or bad.  Sorry.  This is all you get.  Is that continued?  A dopey show.  This is all you get.  I'm sorry.  But I have to point you.  I watch Wide World of Sports on there, and it's cool.  It's like a nostalgia thing.  It's almost like hearing an old song on the radio or something.  You kind of watch this.  We just want people stopping for a while.  You know what I mean?  I mean, they talked a lot about, when I got there, about time spent viewing.  And it's not just like, you know, it's not just staying there, watching a whole game. 
[01:57:00]  Because let's face it, the thing with the classic sports is that, you know, they'll throw on a great game.  But more often than not, those great games in the middle of the second quarter, they weren't so great.  You know, like, fourth quarter.  So it's like, you know, do you—  It's all about the highlights.  It is, and it's all about that whole feeling of nostalgia.  I like the equipment that they're using, things like the limited camera angles.  Oh, yeah, it's phenomenal.  Things like that.  And then just the—it's kind of a comment on the time.  What they had—this one thing I watched, it was on Wide World of Sports.  It was a frisbee dog competition where people threw a frisbee and the dog caught it. 
[01:57:30]  Dude, in front of a packed arena in Los Angeles.  Yeah, going crazy, by the way.  Like, 20,000 fans packing an arena for a frisbee dog competition.  Would that ever get pulled off today?  See, probably not.  But see, remember, that's back in the day, you know, dinosaurs were roaming the earth.  And you had, like, five channels, you know.  You literally—it's like, you know, people sat there and you clicked around that box. 
[01:58:00]  And you had no choice.  Absolutely no choice.  They force-fed this shit to you.  We take advantage of that.  Remember when you had no choice?  Remember that?  Remember the totalitarian regime of television?  Yes.  Let's go back.  And then we went from five channels to 12, and we all realized, we don't want to see a dog catching a frisbee anymore.  It was like that Evel Knievel's jumps on the wide world of sports.  It's unbelievable.  They would have interviews with him and just amazing.  That was—it's kind of a time capsule.  Well, what's good, too, is that for sports, it does help that, you know, you kind of can't be a sports fan unless you know something about the teams that you're fans of. 
[01:58:30]  Like, you're sort—you know, it's like one of those sneaking in history, you know, when you weren't, you know, when you had no idea.  It's like math.  It's like, I know when I was a kid, I learned how to do math reading box scores.  It suddenly occurred to me when I was in math class, I'm like, oh, wait a second.  This is division.  It's like a box score.  We learned math by selling drugs, sir.  So this coyote, can we talk about this coyote for a second? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, very important story here.  Jimmy had an incident last night, by the way, you saw the coyote, with the animal.  I was actually on the upper east side, and I did actually encounter the animal.  I was sitting there on a bench.  From inside—no, you weren't.  You were inside your car.  And it came up and attacked me, and I fought it.  It did not.  It didn't look like a big wolf.  It was like a really scary thing, and there were kids that were playing, and it was trying to bite and hurt them.  No, it wasn't.  And so I attacked and hurt the animal.  You were in your caddy.  You were in your caddy driving, completely safe. 
[01:59:30]  That's right.  You could have run him over and ended the whole thing.  I actually rolled my window down, and I beeped at the coyote, and I yelled, faggot dog.  And I rolled the window off and drove away quickly.  I thought it was one of the many hookers you frequent.  How was a coyote getting in?  That's what I want to know.  They just said it took the bridge.  They just explained it.  Which I don't believe, by the way.  The bridge to the tunnel to the four train.  The coyote—  You got a transfer at Grand Central.  What's going on here?  He got a ticket for being in the HLV lane by himself.  Seriously.  It's unbelievable.  Right now, the coyote's getting a letter.  Does the coyote pay a toll?  Like, what's going on?  It came from Westchester.  He's getting a letter from Easy Pass right now saying he didn't pay. 
[02:00:00]  It came from Westchester.  A photograph of his ass.  Yeah.  So is that what—  It's a pink anus in the tail.  Is that what happens?  You get stuck in the Easy Pass lane.  I've always wondered about that.  What happens if you get stuck in the Easy Pass lane?  They snap a picture, and they send you a letter that says you have to pay the toll.  And if you don't actually have Easy Pass, you have to pay a $25 filing fee.  Ugh.  See?  There you go.  See?  $25.  I know.  One guy I knew just would drive through the Easy Pass all the time.  No line.  No Easy Pass.  Just go right through. 
[02:00:30]  Then they started sending letters to people.  Yeah.  I just say, get Easy Pass.  Yeah, so much easier.  People are like, I want the government tracking me.  All right, douchebag.  That's what they're doing.  They're following you through the Lincoln.  Eventually they will be.  Could you imagine how different history would be if Sonny Corleone would have just had the  little thing stuck to his windshield on the causeway?  Ding, ding.  Right through.  The mobsters would have been there going, holding their guns like, what the hell was that?  What the fuck is Easy Pass?  Holding their Tommy guns.  And Sonny would have made it home. 
[02:01:00]  You're right.  And Michael, you know, probably would have been like a high school teacher.  Just, yeah.  He would have not had to get involved with the whole thing.  But it would have spared us Godfather 3.  So, you know, there's a lot.  Yeah.  There's a lot that might not have happened.  Hey, we should do news teases with Josh, and then we'll talk like classic sports and  what you're up to.  How's that sound?  Nice.  Good.  You could do the hang.  Good.  Yeah, we were talking about news teases earlier when Harry was in here.  It's just the panicky, scare everybody, nothing about informing people news anymore.  It's just about what can they do during your favorite show in three seconds that'll scare 
[02:01:30]  you enough where there's this impending danger or doom on you or your children or your cars  or your family that you have to tune in to find out.  Well, luckily, there's all, you know, there seems to be a food stuff every week now that  if you eat too much of, it will kill you.  Yeah.  Too much, too little.  Or there's a food stuff that if you eat enough of, will save you.  And so, you know, if you want to stick around to find out what, you know, what broccoli  might do for your...  Yeah, but then a couple years go by and the food you think that's going to save you now  doesn't save you anymore.  How many times have eggs swung back and forth?  Eggs are awful for you. 
[02:02:00]  Don't eat them.  Seriously.  Oh, miracle food.  Seriously.  Red wine, tomato sauce, chocolate.  Well, I guess the yolk was on us the whole time because eggs were actually good for you.  Can we just figure that out once and for all?  Should I be eating this egg or should I not?  A man walked on the moon like 80 years ago.  Right.  Can I eat the egg?  I mean, what's tough about that?  It's easy.  Figure it out.  Tell us once, move on.  So we'll do some news teases here.  Some of these, we have to guess what they're talking about, right?  Ooh.  Hey, where's Danny?  It's a game.  Danny helps us out with this.  Danny, are we guessing today? 
[02:02:30]  Danny.  We try to guess what they're talking about in these news teases.  Some are just hilarious.  Ooh, Danny, what mic does Danny use?  Danny, where are you going?  I guess it's over here.  That one's broken.  No, no.  That's because...  That one's busted.  It's no good, Dan.  Busted.  I know the answer to, I think, most of these.  I hope so because usually we hear the tease and then we don't know what the real story  is.  Yeah, unfortunately, again, some of these were the ones that we didn't get to last time  around, so they may have been listener sent.  Right.  Well, how many are there?  How many are there? 
[02:03:00]  Nine.  Nine.  Jesus.  All right, here we go.  All gun shy.  So help us out with this, Josh, right?  Josh Elliott from ESPN Classic.  Do you have a catchphrase, by the way?  Yes, I do.  What's yours?  At the end of the show.  Oh, no.  You really do?  Yes.  This day is history.  Ah, this day is history.  That's all right, though.  Because it was history.  I have a tough time watching ESPN because, I don't know.  Oh, well, okay.  I can't.  No offense, man. 
[02:03:30]  I see what you're saying.  I have a really tough time watching ESPN news.  I love the hockey and all that shit.  But when they start describing three-pointers as trays and this and that and boom goes the  dynamite and whatever.  Well, when which boom goes the dynamite?  Well, that was actually a college kid.  That was the single greatest internet clip of all.  That's why the internet's the greatest thing in the world.  Very good clip.  You've got to see this.  Do we have boom goes the dynamite?  We've got to have.  Ron and Fez play it all the time.  It's like a, what is it, like a Kent State was a college kid doing, you know, a college, 
[02:04:00]  one of those A.B. club broadcasts and just gets lost.  But he's clearly, his only crutch are all his stupid catchphrases.  His catchphrases.  Like boom goes the dynamite.  Yeah, he thought he was like the new Warner Wolf.  He watched ESPN way too much and he figures he needs one of these little catchphrases.  So he came up with boom goes the dynamite.  So, you know, one of the guys would shoot, he'd go in the basket and he'd go and boom  goes the dynamite.  And it's the worst delivery of the worst line ever, ever, ever.  And you can actually hear him, you know, you know, soiling himself. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just shitting.  I believe there's an odd, you can audibly hear it slipping out.  He is so nervous and so bad.  That's acceptable from a college guy and I'm a Yankee fan and I love John Sterling but  I can't listen to him anymore because he's so married to his stupid, he actually said  when Bernie Williams hit the home run, that motherfucker says, Bernie goes boom.  Does he?  Is that what Bernie does, stupid?  I grew up in L.A.  Let me ask you this.  I grew up in L.A. 
[02:05:00]  I had Vince Scully.  I had Chick Hearn.  I had great announcers.  He goes, what is the deal with New York City and the lack of the announcer that you  care about?  Sterling stinks.  You know, John Sterling is a good, when he's doing just regular discussions of things,  he's actually a very interesting color guy, play-by-play guy.  But when he gets into his catchphrases, he becomes, he goes from really, really good and  really enjoyable to listen to.  Yeah.  To horrendous.  Hey, we had Ralph Kiner.  Remember Kiner's Corner?  That one a towering high, a fly ball deep in the center field. 
[02:05:30]  Now this word from Budweiser, the king of beer.  Why do they, why do the baseball announcers have to put that inflection?  That whole, it's like bad radio voice.  But you know why?  Because you feel like you're back, you're sitting in your folding chair and one of the  things has popped out and you're, you know, drinking your schlitz.  Is that it?  It puts you right back.  With the remote that goes, pshing, pshing, pshing, pshing.  Made that metallic ringing sound.  Get a wire on it.  Grandpa, get grandpa another beer.  But the thing with Sterling, too, is that, and here's the problem with the catchphrases, 
[02:06:00]  is you get caught between your catchphrase and what's actually happening.  Yes.  Like, he goes into his home run call and all of a sudden, you know, it's a bleeder pop  out to, like, shallow center field.  And he relies on the fact that he's on the radio, but that wasn't, he didn't give that  around.  When there's two home runs in a row.  We got one.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  This one, it gives me a really, a pain in my ball bag.  He'll go, um, a back-to-back and a belly-to-belly. 
[02:06:30]  What?  All right.  I do have that.  What?  All right.  Hold on.  We got the actual one.  Bam Tino.  It stinks.  Bill Risley warms in the bullpen.  Mattingly swings in.  He has a drive.  The deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is down.  Back-to-back.  And a belly-to-belly.  All right.  A fun batting.  The homers in the right center of the area.  And the Yankees take a three-to-lane.  The Giambino.  That one physically makes you want to rip. 
[02:07:00]  When he does high, far, gone, like that, I like it.  Because it's not, the voice is okay.  But when he goes, mid is high.  Mid is high.  All right.  You are urinating on a great moment, John Sterling.  Put it back in your pants.  And that Dan Coleman is fucking overrated.  How about this?  How about this every time?  Rivera at the belt.  And the 0-2.  Shugger-bell swinging.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  I would never come back. 
[02:07:30]  I would never come back after that.  It's almost okay if it's a walk-off homer.  But he usually does that call when it's like 17-2.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, the excitement of, you know, high score, extra innings.  Right.  You know, walk-off homer.  I can understand a little excitement there.  Where's the surprise?  The Yankees didn't die in forfeit.  Stupid.  It's not.  It's a 17-2 win.  He does that the first.  There's 100 people left in the stands.  You know, the parking lot is empty.  And he's screaming.  But it's like a really bad suit. 
[02:08:00]  It's like he did that once, and he had to push himself away from the chair and think,  oh, that was good.  That's good.  Oh, that's it.  That's good.  I've got it now, boy.  I'm going with that.  I'm running with this one.  Absolutely.  I'm going to have an epileptic seizure after every win.  That'll be good.  But I love his play-by-play call.  Like, I love his play-by-play.  A lot of guys don't like him, you know, but I think he's a great play-by-play guy.  Callman's overrated.  He's got to get rid of him.  Bits out of here!  That douche.  Shut your face.  Got to get rid of the catchphrases.  Bits out of here! 
[02:08:30]  Opie, I promise.  No catchphrases there.  You come to Classic now, no catchphrases.  You're going to move over to ESPN News, I'm assuming.  You know.  I bet you're going to go there.  Far be it from me.  You've got a personality on you, right?  Right.  But see, that's the thing.  Here's the thing.  They're sort of getting away.  It's the anti-personality now.  Now it's like, no more personality.  Now it's like...  They do ESPN News, and they're talking basketball highlights, but they're using, like, baseball  phrases.  Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't...  That's the thing.  It's almost like you could...  You wouldn't know the sport unless you were watching it. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, there's a guy, you know, scoring three-pointers, and they're calling them touchdowns  because it's cool or something.  Yeah, they do that all the time, too, that drives me nuts.  That's what I never liked about basketball, and that's not even a new thing, calling it  a field goal.  Stop it.  Don't call it a field goal.  Yeah, you can't have it.  It's taken.  That term is taken.  Or at least if you're going to use taken terms, at least make it interesting.  Like, every time a guy shoots and misses, he goes, oh, he drops a miscarriage!  At least it would be original. 
[02:09:30]  A miscarriage-ino!  A back-to-back and flat-belly-to-flat-belly!  All right.  All right.  Jimmy, why?  Here we go.  Please explain why.  I just want to know why.  Can I...  Let me ask you, Jim.  Ah!  Parents cry!  Ah!  Parents cry!  Why, Jimmy?  Just one day explain why.  That's all I ask.  What's it like being the guy that can do that?  I like being the guy that can say the thing that we all want to say. 
[02:10:00]  That's a...  You walk...  You're the freest man in America.  You just can't...  You know, some people won't like it, some people will.  God!  Jesus, Jim.  You just have to hope.  See, that's it.  Right there's no karma either.  God love you.  No, there can't be karma.  Because my behavior is good.  I just say awful things.  And God love the satellite.  I mean, seriously, you're like indebted to NASA.  I mean, if we're not launching stuff into the air, you're not the free man that you are.  I love it, man.  I love being here.  I really do.  I absolutely love doing this.  This is why the satellite talk is the way to go with satellite, because you can say whatever  you want.  I mean, it's great.  Do you know, if it wasn't for the Nazis, we probably wouldn't be broadcasting. 
[02:10:30]  Why is that?  Well, the Nazi scientists that were designing the rockets put the satellites in orbit.  So, in a weird, offhanded way, and I know this might offend a couple of people, I just  want to thank the Nazis for coming up with the rockets that put this.  Oh, man.  That's right.  All right.  What?  What did I say?  Nothing.  We're becoming friends with Josh.  As my handlers now yank me, forcibly.  That's what's going to happen.  Look, I think they had a few really bad ideas. 
[02:11:00]  Thanks for having me.  I'm not saying they didn't do some awful, horrific thing.  Josh jokes, but I can't tell you how many people have been yanked up the air.  By rocketry.  In the middle of an interview.  You know.  All right.  Why don't we get into news teases?  Why don't we do something?  All right.  A little safer here.  Let's do that.  Then we'll talk classic sports with Josh Elliott.  All right.  So, the news teases that are there to scare us and make us watch the news all the way  to the end.  Here we go.  Here's the first one.  Well, there's more than a quarter of a million cars that are right now on a recall list. 
[02:11:30]  The thing that could make driving them so dangerous.  What?  I know what that's about.  What is it?  Asians.  No, it's not.  Jesus.  Danny?  Hello.  No.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Why would a microphone work in here?  Let me.  Give me all the answers.  Eve rock.  All right.  Bring that one over there.  I'm going to say that last one that you shouldn't have, but you just have to have, and it's going 
[02:12:00]  to be all right because it'll take back streets, and they probably won't get you in the drag  net there on the main avenue.  What's the, let me hear it again.  All right.  But it's basically saying they're recalling 250,000 cars is yours one.  Oh.  What's the recall for?  Give us the company.  Just the company.  Just the company.  Let's narrow it down a little bit.  Well, there's more than a quarter of a million cars that are right now on a recall list.  The thing that could make driving them so dangerous.  Okay.  Well, it's clearly, it's got to be an American car company, right?  We're not exactly hitting it out of the park. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  You know.  Probably.  I will say it is Ford.  Yep.  And it is a problem with the cruise control that causes a fire when the car is shut off.  Nope.  No?  Nope.  There was a weird function, and I think it was the Taurus, that every time you started  it, it exploded.  I think it's the Saturn.  Yeah.  And it didn't have enough interior lighting to tell if you were with a male hooker or a 
[02:13:00]  female hooker.  And even if it did, you didn't want the lighting.  Who cares?  Jimmy laughs because it's true.  Of course he does.  Now I'm screwed because that was my, just in case I got in trouble with Jim, I was going  to go to the transvestite hooker.  I was given that.  Oh, believe me.  Here's your one weapon.  It's like bringing a, you know, a knife to a gun.  No new material.  No transvestites.  That'll be clear.  Transsexuals only.  Because they're girls.  All right.  Danny?  It is Chrysler. 
[02:13:30]  Uh-huh.  And they're recalling over a quarter of a million cars over wiper defects.  You've got to be kidding me.  What the?  Wait, did she say danger?  Yes.  Was there she said danger?  Well, the danger is if it rains and you've got no wipers.  Well, what could be the problem with the wipers?  Without wipers.  But what, do they suddenly stop on you?  Because, you know, that's sort of, you're going to find that out about two seconds into  that drive.  Yeah.  You're still going to be in reverse when your wipers aren't working.  You're not doing 60 and all of a sudden, you know, it's rain where you can't see.  It drizzles and you hit the thing.  Oh, this isn't working.  Oh, no.  Pull over. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, no.  You're not just driving and all of a sudden, rain!  It's not.  It's more of an inconvenience than a real danger.  Oh, my God.  This is lovely out, hon.  I can't wait to get there and open the basket and eat the germane!  Oh, my God.  The wiper didn't move.  I steered into a coyote.  We got Josh's boss on the line from ESPN.  Josh's boss.  Yes.  Hi.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Josh, it's time to come home.  Yeah.  I got to go, right? 
[02:14:30]  I got to go.  They're telling us you got to go.  Let's say hi to Russell in Cincinnati.  Russell.  Yeah, well, hey, this is, I was wanting to let Norton know that if you put two in the  bay in San Francisco, you call that a Scott from Modesto?  That's the Bonds home run call.  Yep.  That is very funny.  All right, very good.  There was something there.  All right, let's move on to the next news tease here.  2005 was a record-setting year.  How bad will the hurricanes be? 
[02:15:00]  What experts say about a major storm hitting our area?  It's freezing cold out.  The temperatures of the water are freezing cold.  Still scare us with the snow or something.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, because it's not going to be a blizzard.  So they got to start scaring us in advance about a hurricane.  I heard this.  It's some scientist saying that, some weather guy saying that.  We're due.  The Northeast is due.  Do you realize that we are not, they're building out in the Hamptons, and they're not taking 
[02:15:30]  the warnings of 1938?  That's what he said.  1938.  Yeah, big hurricane in 1938.  See that?  And that's the thing.  We're due.  Didn't consumption get people in 1938, too?  I don't think we've got to worry about consumption.  Yeah, we're due.  Natural disasters.  Let's, you know, here's the thing.  We don't know.  We have no clue.  I like that, though.  This is what I like about the natural disaster.  Every region of America has their own natural disaster.  I'm a California guy.  Earthquake.  You know, and it's like, you know, they happen, they happen. 
[02:16:00]  Don't, you know, you kind of hope.  You can hope for the best.  When the concrete's rippling like waves, you know, it's kind of out of your hands.  Yeah.  Hurricanes rolling in.  If you can leave, you hope you can leave.  You know, if you can, or, you know, shelter, caves, something, underpasses.  It's just going to happen.  It's going to happen.  It's just going to happen.  You know what?  Because he said, we're due.  If that worked, I'd be rich at blackjack.  Because I always make those bets when I go, I'm due.  I'm due.  I'm so due.  I've been losing.  I've lost like five hands in a row. 
[02:16:30]  I'm due.  And here comes the big bet.  No, I'm not due.  You get the feel.  You've been playing blackjack forever.  You're up, like, you know, $200, $300.  I was like, oh, this is obviously the hand I got to go all in.  I'm due.  I'm due for a 12.  Great.  And what are we supposed to do?  What do they want us to do?  What do they want us to do?  What are you going to do to protect yourself from a hurricane?  Tear down your beach house in the hands.  Exactly.  Tear it down.  Sell now.  You ever build a sandcastle when you're a kid, and when you're done and you're leaving,  you kick it over so no one else could destroy it? 
[02:17:00]  Right.  That's what you have to do to your houses now, people.  Rip them to pieces and go, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, when the hurricane comes.  This natural disaster stuff used to scare us.  But after 9-11, living through that, you're like, yeah, hurricane.  Okay, well, if it happens, it happens.  You know what else we'd do for an asteroid to slam into the planet?  That happens every 40 million years or so.  Occasionally, they scare us with that one, too.  Yeah.  This one close, only 68 billion miles.  Right.  It's a real close call.  And, you know, since space is never ending, it's close. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  Because if it ended somewhere, it's probably far.  But since it goes on forever, infinity, it might as well be right next to us.  No, it's not.  I'm not even kidding.  I saw that one last week.  Did you?  Last week.  Yeah, of course.  Which one was that, though?  Hey, uh, speaking of natural disasters, we've got to play this for Josh Elliott from ESPN  Classic.  See how I get the plugs in for you?  Hey.  Isn't that nice?  It's seamless.  Uh, there's something crazy going down in Alabama.  Mobile.  They have their own disaster going on.  I just can't get enough of this clip. 
[02:18:00]  We've got to play it again because I'm sure there's a new audience since we played it  earlier.  Listen to this.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it looks like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a treat.  Who else in the leprechaun say yay?  Yay!  Yay!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like. 
[02:18:30]  I'd love to see the sketch.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations  for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  It could be a crackhead that got on to the wrong stuff and it told him to get up in the  tree and play a leprechaun.  We're going to get down to the bottom of this.  You're still down there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man. 
[02:19:00]  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all spells right here.  This is the special leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years  ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold. 
[02:19:30]  I want the gold.  Yes, like we said earlier, this is happening in America.  The natural disaster there is the local news and the public school system.  And someone pointed out that, yes, these people are allowed to vote, too.  Oh, my God.  That's the gift they kept on giving.  I think it's a crackhead.  It gets funnier.  And they told him to climb a tree and be a leprechaun.  It gets funnier every time you hear it.  The backhoe.  That poor tree.  That tree says, come on, move along.  There is nothing to see here.  Here's the video. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, is that a video?  Here's the video.  Let's see.  Wow.  Yeah, well, we're just kind of looking at video on the radio.  I understand.  They're shining a light.  Oh, there's the sketch.  Holy shit, stop it.  There's the sketch.  Like you said earlier, is this a Dave Chappelle bit?  That's a joke.  That they never read on Comedy Central?  That is the amateur drawing?  They can't be showing the amateur sketch on an actual news program.  Please put that up on the website.  That's what the leprechaun looks like.  They drew an acorn with eyes. 
[02:20:30]  That is absolutely an acorn.  Draw it at home.  Draw an acorn and put two eyes right under what would be the head of a penis if an acorn was a penis.  There you go.  There's the amateur sketch.  Oh, is this on opanthony.com?  It should be up there immediately if you want more hits, Steve, because this is too good.  This amateur sketch.  Who would confuse that with Rockwell?  Well, what about that says leprechaun?  Why are they going with leprechaun?  Because it could be a pimp. 
[02:21:00]  I mean, maybe it's a pimp.  It's got the pimp at it.  I don't know.  Awful.  I want the gold.  I want the gold.  I'm going to get a backhoe.  Can we see what those people look like?  I want the gold, please.  Okay, we've got to move on here.  And then we found Boom Goes a Dynamite.  And then we're going to talk about ESPN Classic with Josh Elliott.  That's good stuff.  You know we're never going to talk about ESPN Classic.  No, I know.  But you'd be sending a lot, though.  We're getting our money's worth, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like the fights. 
[02:21:30]  I like the classic fights.  Let me tell you, the fights kill.  A lot of highly rated.  The fights are highly rated.  Yeah.  Well, they don't fight like they used to.  At all.  The fights used to be more exciting.  And they never will.  That's the thing.  It's like you want fighting and the boxing, and you come to the classic.  Holy Leon Spinks.  Yeah, the guy from Mobile, Alabama looks like Leon Spinks.  Early in his career.  That's wonderful.  Is that the guy with the backhoe?  Is that the backhoe guy?  I don't know.  I don't know where the audio matches up to the video.  Hey, did you show any of those old LaMotta fights? 
[02:22:00]  Uh-huh.  Where he would just completely beat up Vicky?  And that's the...  No?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's after hours.  He doesn't need the answer, Josh.  He was just setting you up.  There's being a ghost.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  I love that shit.  More news teases.  Here's the next one.  A man was kidnapped outside his synagogue.  Placed him in the trunk and secured him in the trunk of the car.  How he survived and the one thing he had in his pocket that may have saved his life.  Ooh.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  The obvious joke.  What?  A penny.  A penny.  But how would that save his life?  He's taking you out of his synagogue.  Oh, I get it.  Well, see, now, the reason I pulled that one, even though it's not fear-mongering, is  just that I actually pulled the story simply because, well, you'll see.  All right.  All right.  Here's the actual story.  I think I know what he had in his pocketbook.  That's good work right there.  It is.  Well, you'll see.  After this.  He's doing a fucking tease.  No, I'm an idiot because I was about to just blow this.  He's the tease.  That's very meta.  He had the new thing.  It's a new device that you push and it blows the trunks off of cars so you can get out of 
[02:23:00]  them.  No, that isn't it, Jimmy.  All right.  Here we go.  A man from Long Island was grabbed and beaten after leaving a synagogue.  The thug had been trapped in the trunk of his own car.  Foxx Mike Sheehan has more on the terrifying ordeal from North Woodmere.  It was 6 o'clock in the morning when the 78-year-old victim was leaving Temple.  Seconds later, he was pounced on by two thugs.  These two male blacks, the only descriptions we have so far are that they were wearing hoods.  And the only thing that really could be revealed were their eyes and the areas around their  eyes. 
[02:23:30]  They confronted him.  They asked for cash, which he claimed not to have any.  At that point, they threatened him a little bit further and asked if he had any ATM cards.  Detectives say the frightened man was forced into the back seat of his own car, then driven  by the two thugs to a deserted area.  There came a portion of time where they took him out of the car and placed him in the trunk  and secured him in the trunk of the car.  At that point, this gentleman was in the back trunk of his car and you could hear different  things happening.  The car would occasionally stop, doors would open, doors would close.  The victim spent about an hour in a cramped trunk before trying to escape. 
[02:24:00]  He was able or had a device with him which enabled him to open the trunk of the car.  Although shaken, the elderly victim wasn't heard.  He drove home and called the police.  People who live nearby are shocked.  Not good.  A little scary and very close to home.  I know the area is changing, but I didn't think it was that bad.  That's serious.  I was just shocked.  Shocked.  Something like that should not happen in this community.  As the hunt for these two attackers continues, police are urging everyone out here to use 
[02:24:30]  a little more caution.  Mike Sheehan, Fox 5 News.  I know why Danny pulled the story, by the way, now.  Why?  Danny, go ahead.  Because the guy waited an hour.  No, you're missing the obvious.  Oh.  This is not one.  There we go.  They never tell you what it is that he had.  What object he had in his pocket.  That was the whole thing.  It was something that opens his trunk.  An object that opened the trunk.  It said the one thing that may have saved his life.  That was the tease.  Yeah.  They didn't tell you what the thing was.  A button or something that opens the trunk.  Was it like a key chain?  Who knows?  They don't tell you.  But if they took his car and they were driving around, they probably had the keys, but they 
[02:25:00]  never tell you what the device was.  By the way, how lame are these guys?  78 years old and you got to throw them in the...  What is it?  Jack LaLane?  I know.  What the...  The guy could have been in the backseat.  I think we're good.  Just the backseat's good, right?  So, where are we going?  Exactly.  Slow down.  I don't want to hear him yapping.  Josh, you can hang, man.  We like you.  That's good.  You're perfect for this program.  Hey, we're trying to find ESPN Classic, by the way.  Why don't you help us out?  Tell us what channel is on.  Is this Time Warner right here? 
[02:25:30]  It's right next to Nickelodeon in Espanol, I believe.  It's 84.  Good placement on the dial.  84.  84.  Yeah.  Or not.  There's the weather.  You don't even know where it is.  That's wonderful.  Oh, wait.  No, that was horse racing.  Wait for it?  Is this like digital something or other?  Is it one of those channels that they have to split it with somebody else and then later  tonight it goes to ESPN Classic?  Like time sharing.  They do that with some of these channels in New York.  I hate that.  I believe we're legit.  We're all the time. 
[02:26:00]  24 hours of Classic.  Do you know what channel?  No.  No?  I don't.  You said what?  Wow, that's a damn station.  84?  That's real bad.  All right, go back to 84.  Maybe it's just an infomercial for a little while.  No, that's the TV Guide channel.  Oh, TV Guide channel.  Is this Time Warner, though?  Yeah, probably.  Yes, it is.  It is, but it's not the digital cable.  It's the old analog cable.  Oh, the analog.  Yeah, then you don't get it?  Don't get it because it only goes up to what?  Channel 70 or something like that.  It's 80 or something like that.  Well, we had 84 on.  Well. 
[02:26:30]  No, this is actually our show.  We actually, this is something we do.  You know, it's classic now.  So we'll give you the now right now, and then we do a little classic story.  Why not classic TV Guide channel, where they show what was on, like Leave it to Beaver  will scroll by, and Gilligan's Island.  Ah, the Thurman Munson story.  Yeah, you could be all excited about that.  All right, well, maybe it'll pop on.  Thurman Munson.  Thurman Munson.  Did it even affect you?  Was that just devastating for you?  Oh, yeah.  I was a big Yankee fan.  He was, uh, sure.  Was it 79?  Yeah.  Very, very.  Well, I was that age.  I was so stupid, too. 
[02:27:00]  I actually wrote the date of his death on his card.  I had no value concept.  Little fucking melodramatic nerd just destroying heirlooms.  That'll teach you to care.  Jeez.  I actually have a card from JFK's funeral.  A death card.  You know how they give out cards at funerals?  Yeah.  I have one of those.  Ace of spades.  Two of clubs.  Yeah, three of our worlds.  Let's people know who did this.  Okay, here we go.  Any woman that could hold her husband's brains in his head can drink out of my canteen.  She wear pink.  She drink pachy water. 
[02:27:30]  We have, uh, the next news tease.  It's not scary.  It's just plain dopey.  All right.  Here we go.  Booked and humiliated by cops.  That was a nervous record that day.  The crime?  His mustache.  How it got him tossed in jail.  Tonight on Pox 5 News at 10.  I know.  He got arrested for having a wacky mustache?  For his mustache.  Because he probably put on a dress and tried to use the ladies' room.  Yeah, with that mustache.  Nothing?  I thought that would get a big chuckle.  No, it couldn't have been the mustache. 
[02:28:00]  I'm going out on a limb here.  But I'm thinking, he wasn't out, the cop said drop the mustache, and then hauled him in.  It had to be something else.  Mistaken identity.  I'm going to go with mistaken identity.  Yeah, honestly, I saw the story.  It's vague, but I believe it was mistaken.  You were drinking at the time.  Your mom was hitting on you.  You were drunk.  It's either mistaken identity or it's a really bad mustache.  I believe it was mistaken identity. 
[02:28:30]  It's probably a bad mustache.  You really don't know, though, do you?  Just be honest.  I don't remember.  God damn it.  I don't remember.  Well, we're close to vacation.  Yeah.  If you know what that story is about, please give us a call.  We need to know.  All right.  Here's the next news.  Wait, wait, wait.  That was it?  Yeah, we get nothing.  We have no answers.  We have nothing.  No answers.  That's like the device.  It's like we...  Sometimes we don't get the answers.  It's like life.  That's a tease.  That's a tease.  The next two and the final two, we get the answers.  This is like life sometimes. 
[02:29:00]  Also, a common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers, and that's not all  how the drug is affecting the brain.  Yeah.  I know this.  You know this one?  Oh, I was teased.  Absolutely.  Because I was wondering.  I'm like, was it what I took last night or the night before that did it?  Ambien?  It's like some...  Isn't it like an Alzheimer medication or something like that?  Nope.  Well, the tease said common medicine.  Common medicine.  I would say aspirin.  I already know it.  That's common?  You're out?  No, you don't.  It turns you into gamblers.  I absolutely do.  What is it? 
[02:29:30]  Viagra, because it gives you a nice hard-on, and you don't care if you have bags or not.  You just stick it in and go, come on, healthy.  All right, Jimmy.  Now you get the big laugh.  That's gamble.  That's really fun.  That does make sense and fit the bill.  Yeah.  Do we need to know?  You ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Parkinson's medication.  Ah, that's it.  Common.  Common.  That's terrific. 
[02:30:00]  Common medication.  But are people with Parkinson's even allowed to gamble?  You're fucking a ruckus over there shaking.  They don't know whether to hit stay.  Knocking all the chips all over the place.  Unless you're shooting craps.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the only game.  Shaking the dice.  All right, throw them already, old man.  We can't hit you again.  You have 47.  Ah, ah, ah.  I spilled coffee again.  Ah, ah.  Let's just move on.  It also shows you, doesn't it, like how much news has changed?  Like, can you see Walter Cronkite doing this like 25, 30 years ago? 
[02:30:30]  Man had some dignity.  Like, you know, stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  What dictator down in the Caribbean might end all of your lives?  Next.  Very important.  How could Agent Orange affect the people here at home?  It can't.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  You might know the mustache story, Steve.  Napalm.  Can it be dropped on your street?  No.  Steve, you know the answer to the mustache story?  Yeah, it was a mistaken identity. 
[02:31:00]  Some guy stole 8,000 watches from some store and had the same funky mustache.  And he ended up getting locked up, and they arranged him in a parking lot of a firehouse  in upstate some hick town.  Punch it out.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  Very good.  Mistaken identity.  Mistaken identity.  But what made the mustache funky?  Other than the fact that it was a mustache.  Yeah, it was one of those, like, 70s porno mustaches.  The handle?  Oh, yeah.  It's nice.  Very much nice.  All right.  Here's the next news tease.  Yoga group or dangerous cult?  The investigation tonight at 11. 
[02:31:30]  Dangerous cult.  Both.  I'm going to say yoga.  Just the yoga group?  Yoga group or dangerous cult?  All right.  All right.  Danny?  Unfortunately, I'm scared because we'll never know.  It was a listener submission.  Son of a bitch.  They never told us.  Can you please tell us I have no answer for this one beforehand?  Right.  So it's not to disappoint.  Because now we need to know.  Because now I'm all disappointed.  Here's the whole thing with the news teases.  There's got to be a little payoff. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Thank you.  It's like the payoff.  Coming up next, you know, winner of the big game.  And then nothing.  And then no winner.  ESPN Classics.  You're not going to be playing the 86 World Series and leave out the Buckner play.  Exactly.  You're not going to leave in the top of the ninth.  It wasn't that good anyway.  That's it.  20 years ago, by the way.  Yeah.  We were just showing that clip the other day in the office.  That's unbelievable.  It seems like yesterday.  Certainly does.  All right.  Well, maybe a little longer than yesterday.  I remember yesterday. 
[02:32:30]  Did the Mets own the town back then?  That was right in the Danny Tartable era of the Yankees.  The Mets had it for like a year.  Stupid story.  That was it.  The Mets were big for 86.  And then what did they dismantle the team?  And that was pretty much it.  And this is not the Mets town.  It's amazing how fucking National League fans are deluded.  I mean, the Mets have enough fans.  But this is not the Mets.  Stop.  The Giants won that year, too.  The Super Bowl.  So that kind of made like a stupid Phil Simms.  Kind of put the Mets kind of thing.  On blonde hair.  Who else against Phil Simms? 
[02:33:00]  I just don't like him.  Boy, his charm.  Thanks.  All right.  You're not sold on the Yankees this year?  No.  They're fucking all hitting.  It's over?  Enough with fucking Bavano and all these shitheads.  Randy Johnson, 75.  Is Kevin Brown being re-upped again?  Fucking Steinbrenner should be decapitated.  A cocksucker.  Gene Michael built that team when Steinbrenner left.  That's why Rivera stayed and Bernie stayed and Jeter stayed and fucking all of them stayed.  That's why they kept Joe Girardi when he was batting .250.  Because they just saw that he got big hits when he needed it.  They got brocious. 
[02:33:30]  Stupid Steinbrenner.  Wow.  I've tapped a vein.  Yeah, the guy is.  He bugs me.  He bugs me with that.  We don't want A-Rod and fucking Sheffield.  Stop.  All right.  Here's the thing.  You come on my show, you're going to have to maybe lose the F-bombs.  I do not curse.  You come on.  You do a little Yankees?  Love to.  Yeah, I would love to talk to stupid Brian Cashman.  Who finally got some kind of autonomy, I think, from Steinbrenner.  That may have all been George moves.  You know, all those moves.  But Randy Johnson, I wanted to throw up when they signed him.  Well, you know what they say about the George? 
[02:34:00]  What?  There have been reports that the big A, the Alzheimer's, that perhaps.  Oh.  Well, he is crying a lot more.  I think Alzheimer's is the, like, second big A.  Yeah.  You say the big A.  Yeah, the big A.  You're talking A.  I'm sorry.  The medium A.  Exactly.  It's a cursive A.  You can't walk it off.  It's the lowercase.  You can't walk it off a bathhouse and get 40 people Alzheimer's.  What font is Alzheimer's?  The kindergarten A.  Exactly.  It's Cooper.  It's Cooper's dark dotted paper line A. 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  Speaking of the big A, we've got to play the commercial for Josh.  Josh Elliott from ESPN Classic.  Ah, here.  Here's a classic for you.  Nice.  All right.  This is what you should play in your show, actually.  All right.  In between the segments.  We need programming.  I appreciate it.  Do you do classic commercials on classic ESPN?  Hang on.  Let me write that down.  Wouldn't that be great in between, Roger?  That's a great idea, right?  Stay in the moment.  Classic.  Stay in the moment.  It's not right to fool Mother Nature.  This would be great.  This commercial running when they're showing Jean-Claude Keeley skiing down the mountain.  And then this... 
[02:35:00]  Well, this happened in 1982.  What happened in 1982 that was big?  That was 82?  All right.  I believe 82.  I didn't realize it was...  I guess it was the Lakers or the Celtics probably, right?  In the Yankees, Andy Hawkins threw a 40 hitter.  No, 82, I think it was the Rockets, actually.  It was the Moses Malone Rockets.  Or 82, 83.  It was the Sixers.  Sixers?  Sixers.  With Julius Erving, right?  Dude!  Julius Erving.  Islanders.  Is that when they...  Yeah, we got a cup that year.  Is that one of the cups?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Drive for five?  Was that the Mike Bossy?  Yeah, that was your...  The Mike Bossy.  That was one of the four.  One of the four. 
[02:35:30]  Was that Doug Williams and the Redskins in 82, 83?  No?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  By the way, late 70s, early 80s, NASA, was it just killing out there?  What was it like out there on the island with the Islanders?  Was it just insane?  Islander pride.  It was amazing.  Even when they didn't win, they couldn't stop.  Let's go.  Drive for five.  Whoops.  Missed.  Let's pick up six.  Oh, heaven.  Make it seven.  Try to keep the promotional thing going.  You lost.  It's been three years you haven't won. 
[02:36:00]  Stop with the numbers.  You've got to start back at one, idiot.  Your chances are done until you'll get one.  I'll cut it out.  Well, here's a classic commercial for you.  And it talks about the big A.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous. 
[02:36:30]  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Take that commercial to your boss, please.  Do you remember that at all?  And tape his response.  Oh, my God.  A-D-S.  It was a diet.  A-Y-D-S.  Was it like a little chocolate?  Yeah.  The little chocolates.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I totally remember.  Absolutely.  And they always, it was kind of, one of the things that looked good, like the laxatives,  the chocolate.  And you'd be in your parents' medicine cabinet and be like, I think I want it.  And then like the next day.  It was the worst thing ever. 
[02:37:00]  I said it before.  My mother had the AIDS.  Jesus.  And me and my brother and sister would always be sneaking the AIDS.  We would want the AIDS.  Oh, my God.  So we'd go into the refrigerator.  Just gobbled down on those AIDS.  And the three of us would just sit back and enjoy AIDS.  Did your mother give you AIDS?  My mother would never give us AIDS.  No.  We actually had to sneak behind her back, get the AIDS.  See, they have it all wrong.  This is just a family show. 
[02:37:30]  This is just a family show.  Where was the AIDS?  In the closet?  No, no.  The AIDS in the closet?  It was kept on ice in the fridge.  And you know what the problem with AIDS was?  The timing of this was awful for this stupid company.  And they said it wasn't only the name which was so synonymous with the disease.  It was the fact that you didn't even ingest these chocolates.  They had to be pounded up your asshole.  We want Josh to come back.  We want him to come back.  Everybody knows he's not saying these things.  He's kind of on the fence.  He likes us, but he's not sure. 
[02:38:00]  He knows ESPN News is calling soon.  Exactly.  Yeah, the Nazi thing went a little far.  Kind of back, though, because he said it.  You guys don't have to own that.  That's all right.  It's that announcer voice, though, at the end.  Why do you know when you can enjoy it with AIDS?  Josh Elliott, I understand.  The Nazi thing might be a little sensitive.  But, you know, if you were familiar with the show.  I realize I was not coming on here to, you know, whip up some scrambled eggs.  I understand that.  Because they'll kill you.  They will kill you.  If you're familiar with the show, you'd realize there's this underlying rumor that says that I collect Nazi memorabilia. 
[02:38:30]  And I absolutely don't.  But for some reason, people are under the assumption I do.  I'm Italian.  I'm not even German.  And for some reason, people think I have a conspirator.  All right.  You got to take the hit.  Hey, we changed to the good side at the end.  Why do you have to go?  Why does he have to go?  Uh-oh.  Where are you going?  I'm not going anywhere.  Does he have to go?  Soon?  Oh, boy. 
[02:39:00]  There it is.  We don't start today.  The point thing at the watch.  He's having fun.  No, it's not 11.  Wait.  Is he pointing at a watch or a small number tattoo on his forearm?  Who's here at 11?  I love this.  Can I stay a little bit?  I'm going to stay a little bit.  Who's the guy with the beard?  That's the newly bearded J. Peterson, one of my great executive producers.  Oh, okay.  These guys had this figured out ahead of time.  But now Josh is like, no, you know how I gave you an excuse to get me out of here?  I don't need the excuse anymore.  I'm actually having fun.  Get him out.  All right.  Then let's hurry up here.  A couple more teasers. 
[02:39:30]  This is a safe.  Strangers are meeting for sex in public places.  Places like this.  At 11, we reveal a dirty secret.  The public spots where people have sex.  We're not trying to scare you, but warn you.  On your News Channel 3 exclusive.  Tonight at 11, after an all-new CSI Miami.  Warn you?  How about some directions?  Yeah, seriously.  How about help you?  Jeez, get off the schneid.  And was that some panting on the way out?  That was some kind of sexy music and everything.  A little scratch right there?  They do that?  That, again, was listener-submitted. 
[02:40:00]  So I can't get any reasons, Jimmy.  Let's hurry up.  We'll do the last one.  And this is the worst one.  This is the worst one ever.  Do you have an answer?  And I don't, because this was another one that was listener-submitted.  Enough up.  I'm so glad we told you to get the answers, because that really helped us today.  Yeah, way to go, Dan.  I think we rethink the whole news tease.  Hey, Rob, should you be smiling at this?  If the listeners are going to send in news teases, please send the answers, okay, for  the next time we do that.  Yes.  Or if some listener can call in and tell us all about one of those places.  All right, here we go.  Here's the final news tease for today. 
[02:40:30]  It slays 100 children a year, injures more than 2,000 a year.  It can be up to 45 feet in size, and its victims never know what hit them.  Protecting your child from a hidden killer.  Tuesday, starting at 5.  It's a hidden 45-foot-long killer.  Yes.  Don't see that coming.  It's a guy who hates chatter on airplanes and in movie theaters.  I didn't even see that 45-foot-long thing coming, barreling towards me.  It's 45 feet tall.  Yeah.  It kills children, and we don't even know what it is. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know what it is, but I'd like to.  I will give the boring, real answer.  A tornado.  You know what it is?  No.  Why not?  A tornado's taller than 45 feet.  It's kind of hidden.  It comes out of nowhere.  No.  Why not?  It's like Gigantor or something.  Yeah.  I'm picturing a giant robot crushing children.  It's a giant butterfly.  What is it?  It's that guy from the cover of Queen's album.  No.  All right.  I couldn't think of it as a giant. 
[02:41:30]  Here's the problem, though.  I'm, like, not – I'm scared.  I'm scared to care.  I'm scared to care about this 45-foot-long killer because I'm scared I'm not going to find  out what this 45-foot-long killer – do we have this one?  No.  These listeners, they don't give me the answers, and then you're trying to figure it out.  When I get back to them, they never write back.  I have to know.  All right.  So there's 100 kids a year.  Probably a slip and slide.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  But isn't it a hidden killer, though?  It's hidden.  It's hidden.  Maybe the danger is hidden.  Maybe they put it by a cliff and don't realize it, and they slip off the cliff. 
[02:42:00]  Where, like, a lot of people, they sell wood chippers.  No, and also, let's say, the dangerous call to listen to a wood chipper.  Toys R Us has a wood chipper they're selling.  I have no idea.  Local news does not – they don't understand the adjectives.  They don't get it.  Hidden means you can't see.  You can't see it.  You can't say hidden after you've said 45 feet long.  45 feet.  I'm sorry.  Can we hear that again?  Can we hear it again?  No way it's a tornado.  Well, let's hear it one more time.  Maybe there's a detail in there.  Let's do for a listen, shall we?  It gives a little more.  No.  But, Opie, I want to know. 
[02:42:30]  Opie, I've got to protect people.  I don't know where it is, to be honest with you.  Where is –  Is it a tater ship?  45 feet.  It's a democracy.  How am I going to get back to my studio with hidden 45-foot-long killers out there roaming the streets?  You sure it's not four to five feet?  All right, here we go.  See, let's listen.  Four to five feet.  It slays 100 children a year.  Slays.  Injures more than 2,000 a year.  It can be up to 45 feet in size, and its victims never know what hit them.  Protecting your child from a hidden killer.  Tuesday, starting at five. 
[02:43:00]  It's a truck.  It's a truck.  A truck that – the murdering truck?  What is this?  A ski-hiller movie?  Like 45 feet long?  It is the movie Duel.  Jesus.  It's probably a cord of some sort.  A cord that wraps up around their dumb necks.  It hurts 2,000 a year or something like that.  Maybe it's a rope ladder or something like that.  Oh, a vacuum cord that –  A vacuum cord?  But I think you're going somewhere.  The four to five, it's kind of like when you used to bet with your brother, like, I'll  bet you five doll hairs.  I think you've –  Doll hairs.  I think if you slow this down, he is saying four to five feet long. 
[02:43:30]  It could be up to –  45.  45.  I think it's a cord of some sort.  Now –  Here we go.  Dan's got the answer, though, from Pennsylvania.  What, Dan?  Ben's hog.  There you go.  Ben's hog.  Ben's hog.  Oh, no, because he wouldn't have said long.  He would have said thick.  And it's not hidden.  We say it every morning.  Our executive producer has something going on in his pants.  We don't know if it's –  Yeah.  Man, we're not gay, but there's something going on, and we just need to know what it is.  That's all.  We think he's smuggling beach balls.  We think it might be one of those giant balls with a really tiny, tiny penis. 
[02:44:00]  Maybe it's just a big wallet.  It's like a Stanza wallet.  He just carries it in his front pocket.  We just need to know.  That's all.  It's one of those questions we need answered.  Help us out.  Boom grows a dynamite before you leave.  Love it.  It's Josh Elliott.  But can I also say this from ESPN Classic?  ESPN Classic.  I will say this.  You've got to log on because you've got to see this.  You've got the video because the deer in the headlights, this poor kid.  I don't – you know. 
[02:44:30]  He might have thrown himself into traffic already or been killed by a hidden 45-foot-long killer.  But it's – the video helps with this.  Yeah.  That said, the dynamite does go boom.  He's so scared.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Boom goes the dynamite.  And understand, he's like 30 seconds behind on every highlight.  He's doing a basketball highlight, and somebody's like hitting a three-run homer to left.  Is track two in track one?  No.  No.  Two separate tracks.  Do you have time for two separate tracks?  Of course I do. 
[02:45:00]  Wait, Josh.  Oh, so this is not – he's not like a live commentator.  He's actually –  He's a sportscaster.  Oh, okay.  I was going to say –  But it's like – and it's like a college – it's like a college station.  Okay.  He's doing a TV thing.  So they got him and up is the –  I thought he was – I thought he was a play-by-play guy.  All right.  And I will say, this is the danger, like you were saying, of ESPN.  This is the ESPNization of the sports world.  Everybody feels the need to actually –  What you're not going to see, unfortunately, because you've really got to see the video  clip, like Josh said.  He's way behind the action as he's trying to tell you what's going on.  All nervous. 
[02:45:30]  Here we go.  Oops.  Got to close that door.  Please.  That might blow up the barn door.  Hello, everyone.  Well, the Ball State softball team continued to play this weekend.  And they were hoping to continue off of their straight three out of four losses.  And so we'll take a look and see how that happened.  And there's baseball on.  They started off good, but then eventually the Ball State women's team shut down and  ended up doing poorly.  Hockey.  Oh, no.  And – okay.  We're going to continue on now. 
[02:46:00]  And the ladies' Cardinals will play an Iowa tournament starting this Friday.  Baseball.  Before the Ball State baseball team kicks off its conference season this weekend, the  Cards will battle an in-state rival Indiana tomorrow.  Tomorrow's game will be the meeting between the two, beating both –  Kirst.  He's eating it so bad.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  Hoosiers are on – four on.  On the year.  And they have won six of its last seven games tomorrow will be the game three at 3 p.m.  I lied.  This is good radio.  Switching to Ball State men's tennis.  It seems last –  Which he didn't.  We play on – it seems every week they have a player –  It's crying.  Give him a hug.  Matt Lawrence is the latest Cardinals tennis player to win the award.  Lamar won all the singles and doubles matches last week. 
[02:47:00]  So far, the Cardinals have had a player honored on the weekly awards.  Seven out of the nine – seven out of the nine weeks.  The Cards will play at Boise State Invite this weekend.  Do you know if the news had any type of ball – somebody should hire this guy.  Oh.  He is fiercely entertaining.  Would you watch this every night and just throw his lips up and watch him almost crying?  And then one of those little dead air moments, he just looks at somebody off camera and mouths, 
[02:47:30]  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Just like watching Chris Berman.  I love that.  Oh, he's so –  Well, here's the famous –  I'm eating my balls.  Here's the famous boom goes the dynamite that Ron and Fez play all the time.  This is where that clip came from.  Same guy.  So this is key.  This is still going on.  Still going on.  Dying.  Dying 1,000 deaths at this point.  And we get to some basketball finally.  The Indiana Pacers are looking for a measure of revenge tonight  against the New Jersey Nets and to strengthen their playoff hopes. 
[02:48:00]  The Nets won the last Sunday's matchup, 94-85,  which left the Pacers one game behind the Chicago in the 7-series spot.  Let's check out the highlights.  Steven Jackson's –  Wait for it.  Reggie Miller's looking good. 
[02:48:30]  He shoots a three.  And it's good.  Wait for it.  Later, he gets the rebound, passes it to the man, shoots it, and boom goes the dynamite.  The final scores ended up with the Pacers 63 to the Nets 61.  He had to get his catchphrase.  After all that bombing, wouldn't you just not use your catchphrase?  Perhaps you'd, like, forego the catchphrase and just try to get oxygen?  Oh, my God.  And save it for next time?  The catchphrase without irony, boy. 
[02:49:00]  He's tough.  Because he wanted to use that from the beginning of the broadcast.  You can see him sweating.  He's uncomfortable in his own skin.  Is that a one-time thing, or was he, like, a regular on that college day?  Yeah, because it's a regular thing.  And the best part, though, is he does that.  It comes back.  He's finished.  And he's got, you know, the woman, the female anchor, the male anchor.  And he's clearly the kid that's been kicked around, beat up his whole life.  And the guy looks over here, and they're just shocked.  They are stunned.  And the guy goes, thanks for that, Frank. 
[02:49:30]  And he just looks at him and says, yeah.  Horrified.  Great video.  We really got to get Josh Elliott out of here.  Can I ask a final question?  Yeah.  Oh.  There's this arrogance on ESPN that really pisses me off.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go.  They never, ever say the word RBIs anymore.  You get eight runs batted in.  They'll always say, eight, RBI.  And that changed a couple years ago.  Who the fuck tells you guys to do that?  It drives me absolutely insane. 
[02:50:00]  RBI, they say?  Linda Cohn, whatever.  Instead of RBIs.  Yeah.  Because it's not a word.  It's runs batted in.  So now they'll say, he got eight, RBI.  So now you're, and what you're, it's the same thing.  These announcers that say, like, you know, they've got two times out left.  These people that are, like, they're pluralizing, like, yeah.  Like, RBI is a word.  Yeah, we were brought up knowing RBIs.  It was just, that's what it was.  But it changed where now they all kind of do that. 
[02:50:30]  And I wonder if, does ESPN tell you about your diction?  I think every sports team.  I'm going to get to the bottom of that.  Yeah.  I'm going to get to the bottom.  I don't think it's the ESPN answer for us.  And I will bring it back to you.  The team.  Every sportscaster does the RBI.  That was, you know, he.  They call them ribbies.  Right.  Oh, ribby.  Right.  It changed a couple years ago, whatever.  And all the time now.  And I want to throw something through my fucking TV.  And you noticed it right away, didn't you?  You knew something was wrong, didn't you?  Because it's RBIs.  We're Americans at baseball. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  It's not RBI.  Oh, it's, you know.  I got you.  I got them covered.  I got you covered.  I won't let you down.  I promise.  I'm angry.  I'll get to the bottom of this.  Why can't they just put it?  Yeah, speaking of RBIs.  My brother's bit.  He's going to get angry.  You can hear the anger in his voice.  He's already mad.  You said that you did it.  You said your brother took it from you.  Yeah, well, I came up with it.  Speaking of coming off. 
[02:51:30]  Old whore.  Now we got to explain this to Josh.  You got to come back.  We got so much to explain to you.  I'll catch up.  We hate Sex and the City.  I'm with you.  One of the worst characters on there is stupid Samantha.  Where she's having sex all the time.  We're supposed to believe that she's a hot piece of ass.  And she's weathered and old.  She might have been hot in mannequin.  It's like, hang on.  If you hung out.  My problem with that, and I try to explain to my wife, to no avail.  Those people would not hang out with each other.  Those four characters would hate each other. 
[02:52:00]  They would hate each other.  And that's what they would do.  It would be vicious.  It would be a loathing.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go have breakfast every day.  Oh, and by the way, Sarah Jessica Parker, if you're going to look like that, you don't actually eat.  So don't have the food show up with the big omelets, and here you are stuffing your face.  You're lying.  That is a lie.  They're all lies.  The sausage reminds me of last night.  They are all lies.  I had one this big in my ass. 
[02:52:30]  We know.  You're a slut.  You're not getting me started on that show.  We understand.  You're a slut.  You're a slut.  Right.  Every week.  All right, Josh, from ESPN Classic.  We really don't know what you do there, but we had fun with you.  I've watched the show.  What is the show about, really?  It's Classic now, 7 p.m. Eastern weeknights.  It's kind of rethinking what a daily sports show could be.  I mean, Classic really wanted some daily programming, and so we kind of take the day's sports news 
[02:53:00]  and try to put it in context, perspective, kind of look back, see if something like this  happened before, what kind of happened after that.  It's also a way to, you know, a lot of anniversaries, a lot of, you know, a lot of great guys to  have on talking to, you know, we'll have, we'll have, you know, John Wooden come on, talk  about the NCAA tournament.  It's kind of cool.  It's like, it's, it's a very, it's a very cool way to sort of not get the same old stuff.  You know, I mean, if I wouldn't come, you know, if you want a little idea of where  this all came from, come to our show.  It's a night, it's a great show. 
[02:53:30]  It's a great way to spend a little time.  I think we're all going to check it out now, because, man, they're definitely very cool.  We'd love to have you back, Josh.  It's good.  It's Josh Elliott from ESPN Classic Now, Monday through Friday, 7 and 11 p.m., right?  Indeed.  And, you know, like, two weeks.  Any big guests coming on the show in the near future?  You want to plug?  Who do we have today?  Do we have Jerry West today?  Jerry West and Jerry Stone?  Look at that, Jerry West.  The logo of the NBA.  Who?  I can't read my...  Wait, wait, let's try to read his lips.  I can't read your lips with the beard, all right?  I can't read your lips.  But this is a good bit.  Reading, reading lips.  We want to read your lips.  That's a good radio. 
[02:54:00]  I think he said Mookie Blaylock.  Who do we got today?  Jerry Sloan, Quinn Buckner.  Jerry Sloan.  We got Quinn Buckner, Jerry Sloan, of course, the coach of the Utah Jazz.  Carl Malone's number being retired today.  Yes.  How about Bob Apodaca?  Can you guys get him in?  Yes.  Yes.  But can we get this guy in?  Yes, sir.  Jimmy Norton, man.  F-bombs.  Can we get the F-bombs?  Is that okay?  I don't have to curse.  No, he doesn't care.  He's good like that.  I can replace it with a C.  But he's very passionate.  He doesn't have to work blue?  All right.  You're looking at a big star.  He's going to be on HBO in the very near future.  I'll cut it out.  He's part of one of the TV series. 
[02:54:30]  He's going to be.  I'm a huge fan.  Look, the whole last comic standing thing.  Oh, thank you.  It kind of lost it for me when they made you leave.  No, they had to.  Don't even worry about that.  He's on HBO now, a show called Lucky Louie.  Yeah.  He's going to blow up in like two months from right now.  I know I have to go.  I realize that.  But what happened to that thing?  I had a contract with Viacom MTV, and MTV would not budge and let me out of it.  Really?  And it was conflicted with the time in the house.  Because God forbid you get a little bigger and get some nice airtime on a network, and 
[02:55:00]  then you can go do your thing for MTV.  That's what we said to them.  They made me do two awful pilots at spring break.  But I'm actually glad it worked out that way.  It all worked out great.  Yeah, it worked out for Jimmy a big time.  Tell us about it.  Josh, thanks.  Absolutely.  This was great.  You're going to have to come back, all right?  I will.  If they allow you.  Because this is what happens.  I probably will.  Then you get back to the office.  And they go, you'll never do that show again.  Yeah, so let's see.  Miscarriage, Nazis, and Eights.  Good.  It's a good 15 minutes.  Tonight on ESPN Classics Sports.  All right, boys. 
[02:55:30]  And you know what's great?  It's like, we don't go to break as I leave.  It's just so you've got to show.  Like, I walk in, I'm like, oh, hey, guys.  How's it going?  How's it going?  You know what?  Now we're on.  We're on.  I'll tell you exactly what happens.  If we didn't like you, we actually sit here and make you leave awkwardly.  Yeah.  But kind of like this.  That's our little thing.  Kind of like this.  That's what we do to guests we really don't like.  What you should do is you should put some speakers, like, out in the lobby by the elevator  so that when the person's out, the door is locked.  Oh, they can hear everything?  Is that the biggest thing, loser, I have ever heard?  It depends how big you are. 
[02:56:00]  We'll do that if it's a little old lady like Dr. Ruth Westheimer.  But if it's someone, like, from the WWE or something, we'll have a code.  Are the speakers off?  The speakers off?  Turn everything off.  Turn everything off.  They're off.  That guy was out.  But you had a guy at the door there who was not letting us in.  I was very impressed.  Oh, that's Mr. Poe.  Yes, gentlemen, Mr. Poe.  He's the real deal.  And I'm not finding out.  I'm just going to assume that you could kill me if you're pink.  We think he'll challenge him to a stick fight.  I'm with you.  We're not sure, but we think he has killed.  All right.  So, to sum up, miscarriage, Nazi, AIDS, and news teases with no answers. 
[02:56:30]  The most offensive thing out of what you just said, by the way, is not getting the answers.  Not getting the answers.  Yeah.  All right?  Hey, we've got to talk about this contest we're doing for the four teams that remain in the  NCAA.  We're not allowed to say Final Four.  Why?  Well, don't say it.  You just said it.  Yeah.  Well, seriously, why?  You know, like when the Super Bowl comes around, you've got to say the big game.  They've actually turned now.  The Final Four is like the Super Bowl. 
[02:57:00]  The Final Four decided, hey, that's a great idea.  So, now we have to say between the remaining four teams in the NCAA college basketball championship  championship tournament.  Like Final Four.  And you know what?  We want to say Final Five minus one.  Well, seriously, that's good.  Yeah.  Final, you know, Final Two squared.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Final Two times two.  So, what's the contest?  It sounded vaguely sportsy.  It's our friends at bowdog.net.  They're providing us with a trip for one lucky pest.  Our audience are pests. 
[02:57:30]  And a guest, a pest guest, to attend the games between the remaining four teams in the NCAA  college basketball championship tournament.  Also known in some circles as the Final Four, but I'll say it.  Honestly, not here.  Want to go?  Simple.  Boom goes the dynamite.  Let us know what you do for the trip.  Log on to howcrazyareyou.com.  Is that the URL?  Yes.  Howcrazyareyou.com.  And tell us what you're willing to do. 
[02:58:00]  And if we like it, you come down to the studio Thursday.  Isn't that tomorrow?  That's what we're taking tomorrow off.  No.  You do your little stunt.  You do your thing.  And if we like it best, you'll be off to the hoops tournament with a guest.  How about that?  The hoops tournament.  The hoops tournament.  Who is writing this stuff?  And we'll send you to the throw the round ball through the ring contest.  It's lawyers.  Wait till the lawyers get a hold of you there. 
[02:58:30]  Lawyers get their mitts in things.  And put the final four?  You can't say the final four?  No.  No.  No.  We're all in trouble.  Shh.  They'll hear you.  They'll hear you.  There are witches.  There are witches.  Satellite, the final, that's the F-bomb on satellite radio?  Well, then we have some mumbo-jumbo legal shit we have to say.  Must be legal continental U.S. residents when they're older.  An XM Satellite Radio subscriber.  Contest runs 320.06 to 323.06.  Subject to official rules at www.howcrazyart.com. 
[02:59:00]  See official rules for prize descriptions and complete details.  Void where prohibited.  So let me just get this.  Let me get this straight.  I'm Hawaiian.  Yeah.  I can't participate in this contest.  Is that what they're getting at?  A continental, is that what that's at?  A continental?  Continental United States.  Alaskans, go screw.  No.  You're not allowed.  How many teams are there in Hawaii and Alaska?  That's not continental.  Hawaii had a fine team.  No, but I mean professional teams.  Who's going to win this year?  Who should win? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  UConn.  Absolutely.  They are, when they are, they're far better than anybody else.  Jimmy, who do you think?  I was going to go with UConn, but a lot of people are saying no.  Yeah.  Okay, so Jimmy, what do you think?  Rutgers.  My pick was Seton Hall, but, you know.  Yeah.  Dorm fire.  What happened?  No idea.  Are they still in?  No, right?  Wait, come on.  He might come back still.  He might come back.  Jimmy, we like him. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  This is horrible, Jimmy.  So, and it's void where prohibited, so.  Man, this is, I need a Jimmy on my shoulder.  I need an inner monologue that just runs free.  I love that.  It's just Jimmy.  Jimmy on your shoulder.  I'm going to give thanks.  I'm going to give thanks for Saddle.  And the void where prohibited, the void where prohibited, we don't really get that concept.  Like, somewhere.  Well, apparently, it's void in Hawaii.  And Alaska.  Void in Hawaii.  Is that where the void where prohibited, or is there a small town somewhere?  Well, I don't know.  I think it's continental U.S., and then somewhere else, it's probably void where prohibited. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  By law.  And, like, U.S. Virgin Islands, you're out.  Don't even bother.  Out.  Probably.  Out.  Probably in the area.  No Guam.  Don't waste our time.  No Guam.  No Guam.  Stop.  Probably in the area of America where they're seeing leprechauns.  I bet it's void.  Or pimps.  I bet a lot of things are void where prohibited there.  Yeah.  The leprechaun pimp.  There's an idea.  Hey, there you go.  For MTV.  There's a show right there.  It could be the leprechaun pimp.  That's right.  That's good.  Pimp my leprechaun.  All right.  Let's all thank Josh Elliott from ESPN Classic.  Josh, thank you, sir.  Classic now. 
[03:01:00]  He's the host.  See, we like you, so this is how we do it.  Good.  Now we'll go to break.  Now we go to break.  Yes.  All right.  And I'm.  Central Park Coyote captured in New York City.  Breaking news.  Where's our Fox News alert?  We got breaking news.  God damn it.  All right. 
[03:01:30]  Hold on here.  This just in.  Central Park Coyote captured in New York City.  We're looking from our XM Sky Chopper 4 and high above Central Park.  We're seeing a chase, a pursuit, a foot pursuit of the Coyote.  Police appear to be shooting him with a tranquilizer dart.  He goes down.  The danger is over.  The Coyote, Central Park Coyote, again, captured in Central Park. 
[03:02:00]  In honor of the Central Park Coyote, and boom goes the dynamite.  And boom goes the Coyote.  All right.  We got to say hi to Judah.  Judah Friedlander is back in studio.  What's up, Judah?  Hey, Judah.  Thanks for having me.  That's right.  Thanks for having me back, guys.  Judah was really, really enjoying the pal talk during the commercial break.  It is a lot of fun, isn't it?  Norton showing his ass goes a long way with the chicks.  Well, the girls give. 
[03:02:30]  I love it.  It's worth it.  It's worth it.  To give back.  Jimmy has to give back, and he does.  He showed his ass.  Believe me, I'd pull out the hog and show it, too, if I didn't think I'd get fired from  XM.  Well, you grabbed it.  Why not show him on camera the front of his crotch through his pants, and then grabbed  it through his pants.  Trousers.  Very manic.  Chicks wanted it.  We got a question for Judah right off the bat from movie guy, Kent.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, I have some questions for Judah.  Are you going to bore us to death, or are there going to be questions that everyone 
[03:03:00]  wants to know the answer to?  Well, I wanted to know what was up with the movie he did for, what was that show?  The show on Bravo?  Oh, Project Greenlight, the horror movie.  Project Greenlight, yeah.  Feast.  What happened to that?  Yeah, I just ran to the director.  I heard it's going to open in October.  It's getting some kind of a release in October, and then a DVD.  It's like midnight screenings, and then a DVD in October.  A lot of blood and guts in that movie.  It was fun.  I had maggots all over my body and my face. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  Real maggots?  Real maggots, in my mouth, up my nose.  Yeah, it was cool, man.  It was cool.  But they're not dangerous, right?  Nah.  They're just creepy.  They're just maggots.  Yeah, but it was cool.  Did you swallow any?  I don't know.  I had to shoot one out of my nose.  It's like an effect.  It's like a rocket.  A little rocket snot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was a maggot?  Can't they green screen that some?  Yeah, but we want to do the old school effects.  Yeah.  Very little computer effects.  You make it old school, just nice.  Lots of buckets of blood and a bunch of hot chicks in the movie. 
[03:04:00]  How'd they get maggots in your mouth?  They just like...  I put them in there.  Ew.  It was my idea.  Because I figured the movies, it's like a horror comedy.  And the grosser it is, theoretically, the funnier it should be.  So I was like, fuck it.  Let's go for it.  That's the formula.  Yeah.  And maggots in the mouth.  Very funny.  Judah's lived in roach-infested places, though, so nothing bothers me.  I actually have.  I'm trying to get...  Years ago, I took video, because my place was so roach-infested.  All my videotapes had roaches, like, living in them. 
[03:04:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Like, they crawled in the cassette itself?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again, started, like, nests within the videotapes and stuff.  I have some old food from it.  How many roaches would you guess?  Just hundreds and hundreds at this place.  You just saw them every day?  Yeah, like, because I finally...  After, like, four months...  Because I see one every once in a while in my place.  After...  Every time I used to open my door, I'd open my front door, and then a roach would just come  shooting down the door, just crawling down.  Shut up!  I'd be like...  I'd be like, whoa, what the fuck, you know?  And then, uh...  And then finally, after months and months, I open my door up all the way, and on the side 
[03:05:00]  of the door, when it opens up, just...  The whole thing covered with roaches.  The entire thing covered with roaches.  And then one day, we got a...  I got this super roach spray, and I got my friend with a video camera, and we just  sprayed them all, and just, like, you know, hundreds of roaches just...  Dying.  Yeah, at once.  It was pretty cool.  But yeah, always had to shake the clothes.  You ever get them in bed with you?  You're like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You shake the clothes, shake the sheets.  You fuck them?  No.  No.  No.  But, uh...  You ever have one crawling you do? 
[03:05:30]  He would tell me roach stories, and I'm such a buggerful, it would fucking drive me  nuts.  It's not all bugs, but roaches are one of those bugs that just skeeve me out.  Yeah, yeah.  Really bad.  I don't know why, you know.  It's not like they're any uglier, really, than any other bug, are they?  Yeah.  Maggots weren't as bad as roaches.  Maggots are pretty bad.  Maggots are slow.  They're slow.  They don't really move much.  Yeah.  You put them on you, and they stay there.  The roaches are...  The roaches are quick, man.  Yeah.  So...  Yeah, maybe that's the whole thing, why they're bad.  I remember I was on a job site in a basement of a brownstone in Manhattan here, and I had 
[03:06:00]  to take a dump.  So I had to go down to the basement bathroom, and I'm sitting on the bowl, and it's just this  stark cement, like, bathroom with a toilet bowl in it.  So I'm taking a dump, and I hear, and coming right at me, towards me, was this giant cockroach  coming right at me.  And I have like half a loaf coming out, and I swear, my asshole was like a guillotine.  Boop! 
[03:06:30]  Stopped it, and jumped up without wiping.  It was just a mess.  I let out a little eek!  It was horrifying.  And I'm just thinking this roach did that to everybody.  Just knew.  I'm going to scare the shit out of the next guy that's taking a shit.  Actually, scare the shit back into you.  Is there anything worse than fucking squeezing off a log with half of it still in there when  you're trying to wipe, and an hour later, you're still pulling out humps?  Nothing.  You got half of it right there.  It's fucking awful.  Half the train pulled up to the station.  It's waiting.  Just waiting there.  Hey, Ken, another question? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, I was wondering.  The first one was really exciting, by the way.  Thank you.  Wait, what was that?  The first question was really exciting, so we appreciate the help today.  You know you're Kent the movie guy until we get anybody that's even a little better  at movies?  That's right.  Keep that in mind.  Keep that in mind.  But is the director, John Gulliger, as creepy as he seems?  No, Gulliger is actually a great follow-up question, by the way.  Yeah, Gulliger is a totally cool dude.  Yeah, weird dude.  But yeah, the crew, they gave him, some of the crew gave him a lot of shit, and some 
[03:07:30]  didn't, you know, because he was a contest winner.  But I think the guy's visually really good, and the movie's got like, I've only seen bits  of it, but it's got a real like Evil Dead type vibe, and cool camera work, and Gulliger's  got a twisted sense of humor, so I don't think there's going to be anything corny in the  movie.  The movie kind of makes fun of corny movies.  Kent, you done?  Yeah, that's it.  Thanks, Kent.  Terrific job today.  Thanks.  All right, bye.  Every appearance, by the way, could be Kent's last on this show. 
[03:08:00]  I thought Kent was compelling.  I want to ask Judah about a movie that I've been watching get filmed in my neighborhood.  Chapter 27.  Oh, yeah.  What part are you playing in Chapter 27?  I play, yeah, Chapter 27 is a really sad, creepy movie.  It is creepy to watch.  It's a John Lennon movie, or actually it's a Mark David Chapman movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's about the murder of John Lennon.  Yeah.  So they're filming scenes right outside the Dakota with Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  He looks so much like Mark David Chapman that you're creeped out on the sidewalk going,  oh my God, this is how it had to be that day.  Yeah.  And just like on the sidewalk with his little book there, just rocking back and forth.  Yeah, it was, he was pretty.  He was in character is what I'm going to say.  He was in character the whole time.  It was really creepy, man.  He was in character the whole time, and he was really good.  Pretty much all my scenes were with him.  I played this guy.  It's a character based on a photographer who was actually the person who took the photograph 
[03:09:00]  of the real Mark David Chapman getting the autograph from the real John Lennon, who's the only  guy that got that photo.  Because he's the, this guy was like an amateur paparazzi guy, so he used to hang out in front  of the Dakota all the time, where Lennon lived, and actually got to know Mark David Chapman,  because Chapman stalked him for about three days.  This guy had no idea, you know, how insane.  You're a great judge of character.  Yeah, nobody did.  You know, he hung out in front of there. 
[03:09:30]  The door guys knew that he was there and everything for like three days.  Wait, the photo was taken the day of the murder or no?  The day of the murder, yeah.  I think it's the last photo of Lennon alive, too, was the photo that this guy took.  How long before the shooting?  I think it was the same, I think it was just several hours.  I can't remember.  But yeah, so I played that photographer, yeah.  Whatever happened to that photographer, anyway?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Has he taken other great shots?  Probably not.  I don't know.  How do you top that?  That's what I'm saying.  Would Africans shoot a lion? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I don't know if it's possible.  But yeah, so I think there was a lot of opposition to making the movie, because when we were shooting  it there, some people would come by and scream it and stuff.  Oh, they were just pissed off.  But you know what?  I understand.  I understand, you know, because it's such a...  Are they going to shoot John Lennon being shot?  What's that?  Are they going to shoot John Lennon being shot in this movie?  The movie basically starts from the Mark David Chapman character coming to New York.  You know, so it's like a three-day trip, and then from him getting arrested. 
[03:10:30]  Okay.  So I think some of that's covered, but that's the small part of the movie.  I heard they're going to shoot it somewhere else, because...  Yeah, perhaps you shouldn't do it right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Dakota said no way to that.  Yeah, I wasn't...  Actually, the Dakota said no way to all this, but they're just, you know, you're allowed to  shoot on the sidewalk in New York.  Right, right.  They shot some in front of it on the streets and the sidewalk, and then some on a soundstage  in Brooklyn.  It was a lot of fun to watch, all the paparazzi coming out to get shots of Jared Leto and 
[03:11:00]  Lindsay Lohan.  She's in the movie.  Yeah, who does she play?  She plays a person also based on a real person.  Not the nicest person, by the way, Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah, I didn't work with her too much, so...  She is a...  Yeah, whatever.  A goose.  What did you do?  I didn't do anything personally.  Did you go up to her and say something?  No, I didn't.  You didn't?  Somebody else did to help out a young fan, and she was too busy reading lines.  It was just a whole scene that was ridiculous.  Well, maybe she was busy.  She had...  Nah, nah, nah.  She had an attitude. 
[03:11:30]  It was a little girl too.  She couldn't take a picture with a little girl.  It's like, come on.  Stop.  Maybe it was cocaine.  And it wasn't...  And they weren't even close to filming.  This was like they were just setting up and stuff.  Whatever.  Oh, really?  Maybe he's good friends with Lindsay Lohan.  Whatever.  Maybe Judah's banging her.  No.  Are you banging her?  Yeah, I could be.  But she's in the movie as well.  If there's a check, I'm probably banging her.  And the one of the paparazzi that's...  He's legendary.  He just would not say no.  You know, he was like just...  I'm surprised they didn't arrest him, because he's the guy that had a bandage on his face 
[03:12:00]  recently because he got beat up by somebody.  Oh, I think I know who you mean.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a lot of paparazzi there all the time.  This guy's legendary.  All the rest of the paparazzi...  I'm forgetting his name, but I know who you mean.  The paparazzi in general, people get a really bad reputation, obviously.  This guy is hated by the paparazzi.  That's how bad he is.  Why?  Who is he?  I mean, what's he?  He's really famous.  I just don't know his name off him.  Yeah, I'm blanking on his name.  He's been in a lot of scuffles.  Every premiere, you see him, and yeah, he's in everything.  Dark hair, curly dark hair with glasses.  He's a scumbag?  I think he's just kind of half nuts, the guy. 
[03:12:30]  Because they wrecked shots for everybody else, because because of him, they push paparazzi  to other angles and other areas of the set.  Go get her.  Yeah, that whole paparazzi, it's a weird thing, yeah, the whole thing.  But yeah, the movies, it's like, some people are complaining that, you know, oh, it's celebrating  the murder and stuff like that, and the script really isn't.  And I think it's kind of examining people's ridiculous obsession with celebrity and how 
[03:13:00]  people go insane over it.  You know, so it wasn't something that is, you know, looking down on anything about John  Lennon or trying to promote this Mark David Chapman guy.  You know, it's...  I love how you've got to make excuses these days to make a movie.  They make movies about World War II.  Right.  Exactly.  Vietnam.  That fucking rape.  Right.  They make movies about tap dancing.  Yeah, yeah, because there were all these, there were like some, I think some websites started 
[03:13:30]  to say, don't let this movie get made and all this stuff.  Stop it.  You know, and they're just like...  I was a guy in a band.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How is Steve Byrne, by the way, as Yoko?  Oh, he was excellent, man.  I tell you, good casting.  So that sounds like it's going to be an interesting movie.  Yeah, yeah, it was very, it was...  It's a Canadian company, too, or something like that.  You know, I'm not...  I don't, I didn't know it could be, I just know it was a low-budget, independent movie. 
[03:14:00]  But I got to tell you, Jared Leto looks...  He did a great job.  All my dreams were with him.  It's creepy.  Yeah, he...  To see him outside the Dakota, you're like, this is exactly what it was back in 1990.  Yeah, he did a really good job, yeah.  Right on.  And Yoko Ono just was not happy at all.  Why?  Because they were filming this, right?  Yeah, I mean, you can understand how, you know.  Absolutely.  She still lives there.  That's got to be beyond creepy.  Look out the window and go, oh, that's nice.  Deal with that.  Oh, great, I got to relive this.  I mean, look at that.  Yeah, that's true.  You think she's looking out the...  She's a big place there.  She's looking out the window and going, that's not really how it happened. 
[03:14:30]  No.  Move over a little.  Is she thinking to herself, like, you know.  Eek.  So...  Thinking she has a nice apartment in the Dakota?  Probably.  Maybe she owns it.  How much do you think a place goes for?  That's got to be 40, 50 grand.  Could be a little more than that, Jimmy.  They have free meals.  Hey, we do have the audio of the setup car.  We did...  We have to do this before we get out of here.  Yeah, let's hear a setup car.  You want to explain?  Another one of these stings.  They're great.  What they do is the cops set up a car to be stolen. 
[03:15:00]  They put it in a bad neighborhood.  And they have it rigged.  They'll, like, leave the key in it or something like that.  Yeah, but they also have it rigged electronically where they can then shut it off and lock the doors.  So now whoever's in there can't run.  They can't make excuses that they didn't steal the car because it's the cop's car.  And these guys go into panic mode.  They try to break the glass and get out.  So it is like Alan Funt should be in there.  That should be a show.  Of course. 
[03:15:30]  Why can't we throw shows like this on TV?  Yeah.  Well, it's called the news.  It's called, what, being moral or something?  I don't know.  I like the police chase video shows.  I love watching that.  Because the Internet Predator show we love.  Internet Predator is great.  Anytime there's a hidden camera or someone doing something they shouldn't be doing,  a guy pissing in the boss's coffee pot,  how many times have you watched that?  It's great stuff.  People love it.  Eat that shit up.  Yes.  Here we go.  What you're watching is a car thief about to have a very bad day. 
[03:16:00]  Holy shit, it's Internet Predator guy.  The Internet is the same guy.  Look at the coyote in the water.  What?  Is this a...  Where did he...  I thought we caught the damn thing.  I think it was a replay.  There's a bear now.  Should have jumped.  Oh, my God.  A bear is loose in Central Park.  And you know what?  Grr.  Grr.  We might.  I don't think we've ever done this before on our brand new show.  We might have to play something for the third time in the same day.  Well, we might have to.  That's a little tease for Judah. 
[03:16:30]  But let's stick to it now.  We'll see how good you are.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's stick to the car thieves.  Yeah, so the car thing.  It's the same reporter that did the...  What's his name?  I don't know.  But he's got this, you know, the dumb TV voice.  As he talks completely naturally.  As he's picking up predators.  Sex.  We're looking at car thieves.  Yeah.  About to have a very bad day.  Is it Chris Hansen?  This will end up being a car-tastrophe for these car thieves. 
[03:17:00]  A car-tastrophe.  Stop.  Here we go.  What you're watching is a car thief about to have a very bad day.  He doesn't know it yet, but the car he just stole is a trap set by the Dallas Police Department.  He's already locked in.  And every turn he takes is being tracked by satellite.  Every move he makes is caught on hidden cameras as police close in.  Hey, see.  Same with this guy.  And her. 
[03:17:30]  They're all just minutes from being arrested.  They think they got away, you know, Scott Clean, and then all of a sudden they see the police behind them.  Dallas police have arrested 97 people for trying to steal so-called bait cars since the vehicles were first put on the streets here 18 months ago.  Perhaps more importantly, auto thefts in the city have dropped by double digits.  As fear has spread among thieves that the next car they steal could be one of these.  We'd like to show you the outside of one of the bait cars, but for obvious reasons, police don't want you to see what they look like. 
[03:18:00]  Let's just say they're the kind of cars pros like to steal.  And police departments nationwide love the idea of letting the bad guys come to them, or at least their cars.  In Columbus, Ohio, they've even added a soundtrack.  Soundtrack?  All right.  It's cynical.  Because it's cynical.  It's all bad news for thieves, but a classic win-win for police and insurance companies who provide the bait cars, hundreds nationwide, for free. 
[03:18:30]  Still, there's a car stolen in the U.S. every 26 seconds or so, $7.5 billion worth of wheels gone in 60 seconds.  Most thieves are opportunists.  If they see an opportunity, they're going to take it.  Got driver's license, insurance card.  In Dallas, most thieves are still caught the hard way by good old-fashioned police work.  But officers here are making the most of their new tool and having some laughs along the way. 
[03:19:00]  Catching car thieves in the app.  For today, Don Teague, NBC News, Dallas.  I love the soundtrack.  That's brilliant.  We're thinking they just play, Baby, You Can Drive My Car.  Not.  But this is actually a pretty smart deterrent tactic, if you think about it.  That added insult with the bad boys, we got you, and the soundtrack.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Certainly looked like they had audio from inside the car.  They didn't. 
[03:19:30]  No, they didn't.  That stunk.  Damn it.  You're going to have to watch it.  It's brand new fishing, though.  You're just going fishing.  Just fishing.  Just leave the beat out there.  Just whistle.  I think we got a nibble.  Whistle.  Get a six-pack.  Yeah.  You'll get a big catfish.  Big bottom feeder.  And my friend Judah, who I love, wants to plug a gig.  And I'm going to say for the record, because this is the only comedian or friend I will ever  allow to plug this club on this show. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, wow.  Really?  Oh, no.  It's the club that Jimmy doesn't like.  You're letting him plug this club?  You must really like Judah.  You must really like him.  Judah's a good comic, man.  I would recommend seeing Judah, even if he wasn't my friend, because he's fucking hilarious.  Thanks, man.  But you're just doing this because he's a really good friend.  Well, no, no.  But I mean, you really don't like this club at all.  Oh, I hate.  What?  I hate.  Fucking Gotham.  Why do you hate Gotham?  What happened?  Because when I was doing the Tonight Show, it was an abomination nightmare to get on. 
[03:20:30]  I think this happened with two different Tonight Show appearances.  That fucking coward manager that ran the club.  I don't know.  We got to talk to them at the owner.  I'm like, look, I got a Leno date in a week.  I just need to come in.  Oh, you want to do a guest spot to work on your set?  My five minutes.  Four minutes plus two minutes panel.  Right.  It was a spot already.  And the fucking ringer they put me and my management through.  And finally, we get Mazzilli on the phone.  He goes, oh, I'd love to have you run the club.  It's that passive-aggressive shit.  I'd love to have you work club.  And then of the five days I needed, he gave me three of them. 
[03:21:00]  But the reason he wouldn't give me one of the other days is because it was a Latin show or some shit.  And one was a fucking bringer show, which means young amateurs show up with their friends.  And a Latin show.  I'd love to see a fucking black comic wanting to go on and work out a Tonight Show set and have him say, nah, man, we got all white comedians.  I would fucking love to see that shit happen.  Never.  Passive-aggressive shit.  I fucking hate it.  Yeah, but it was theme night.  All right.  Exactly.  That's a good plug.  And that's the all, nah, but June is really, that's not even the same club June is doing.  Well, I'm actually, I hate to break this to you, but I'm actually, no, I'm performing on Latin night there. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, wow.  What a slap in the face.  Maybe I really shouldn't do it.  Slap in the face.  No, I would go and see.  No, that sucks.  No, I know what you mean.  I mean, in the clubs, it happens, you know, at so many of them, and I've, it certainly happens  to me constantly, you know, bullshit happens all the time.  Awful.  Fucking frustrating.  That's the only club that did that shit to me.  Some comic, some fat comic tried to do that to me at, uh, at Stand Up New York.  You shot him.  I remember that.  And she was corrected.  I would love to have shot him.  Yeah.  Big fat fuck. 
[03:22:00]  All right, June.  Hope she's dead.  Let's, uh, let's get the plug.  Uh, no, I was just saying, uh, next, next Thursday at Jim Norton's favorite club, uh,  Are you actually at Gotham or at the other one?  Uh, it's the new Gotham.  Okay.  The new Gotham.  They have a new club.  Oh, that sounds like a nice place.  Yeah.  It's 23rd.  Uh, I'm there one night, just headlining one night, next Thursday, March 30th, uh,  830.  Do you have a number for them?  It's, uh, 212-367-9000, or you can, uh, go to my website, judafriedlander.com, and it'll 
[03:22:30]  show you the info.  And I will say, for the record, Judah is, I mean, a really funny act, and I would definitely  go see him.  That's the only night I would consider patronizing that club.  Uh, Judah's funny.  Maybe he can wear a mustache or something, so they don't know you're there.  Jimmy's just pushing it so he can pour gasoline in the front door and throw a match in.  Jim, if you want to do a gas set, I can hook it up.  You probably could, but they wouldn't allow it.  Ah, we gotta ask.  Ah, bah.  Fucking douchebags.  I have a movie that just came out on DVD, too.  I'd love, I'd love the plug if I could.  Yeah, it was, uh.  Okay. 
[03:23:00]  It's straight to DVD, but, uh, I had fun making it, uh, it's called Southern Bells.  It's, uh, Anna Faris from all those scary movie movies, that chick, and, uh, that just  came out on DVD.  I play her, like, asshole boss at, like, a Walmart-type store.  It was fun.  Nice.  So.  We gotta go to Spike in Chicago real fast.  Spike, what's up?  Yeah, um, you can find some of those links to the Bake Car videos.  I think it's, uh, bakecar.com, or I even saw one at, uh, dumpalink.com.  Okay, we'll check out those websites.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:23:30]  Thanks, Spike.  All right.  No problem, man.  Yeah, thanks.  Very informative, uh, question.  I tell you, that Spike just calls right in.  He's good.  You wanna hear the leprechaun story, Judah?  Yeah, I gotta hear this one more time.  We have a coyote loose in Central Park.  I know.  It said it was captured.  I think they caught it.  They said they captured it, but the news is still showing video.  Maybe there's more than one.  Like, uh.  Oh, my God.  Like, uh, the bad guy in Mark for Death.  Uh, like, Screwface in Mark for Death.  There were two of them, you know.  Oh, that could be.  I think by now, Steve.  There's a, there's a coyote twin. 
[03:24:00]  I think by now Steve has, uh, put the video up on opiananthony.com of this new story from  Mobile, Alabama.  This is a real story.  New story?  Uh, yes.  Okay.  They have something loose in Mobile, Alabama.  And Anthony came up with, uh, something that was really good.  It sounds like this is like a Dave Chappelle bit, but this is a real new story.  No lie.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me. 
[03:24:30]  I gotta do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Leprechaun.  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This signature sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff. 
[03:25:00]  And it told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun.  Let's get down to the bottom of this.  Just get down there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This is awesome.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all smells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish. 
[03:25:30]  And I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want to go.  Get me to go.  I want to go.  I want to go.  Ain't that America?  I want to go.  That sounds like the scariest place in the world.  No kidding.  I love that. 
[03:26:00]  The leprechaun.  The leprechaun.  I am leprechaun.  I am leprechaun.  What?  That's the end of the show.  Wow.  What happened?  What?  What the?  That went very quickly today because we had fun.  It was a fun-filled show with fun-filled guests.  We didn't even get to talk about American Idol.  No, huh?  They're throwing someone off tonight?  I guess.  Might be time for little Kevin to go.  That's a nerd kid?  That little nerdy kid.  Kevin?  I don't know.  I think they'll throw one of the chicks off.  He's really bad. 
[03:26:30]  He did a song, and he was really off-key and stuff.  Again, the rocker dude there.  What's his name?  The Teeth Guy?  Fred.  Chris Dautry.  Dautry.  Dautry or something like that.  Chris Dautry tore up a version of Johnny Cash's Walk the Line.  He did a version of Walk the Line.  He didn't even recognize that was a Johnny Cash song.  He made it his own.  The guy is a performer.  He is a performer.  And he was probably better than that fucking cleft-palate fucker that played Johnny Cash.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix. 
[03:27:00]  How was that?  I didn't see that.  No good.  Oh, I was going to go try to rent Stacey Keach as Johnny Cash.  You're better off fucking Twinkle Twinkle Killer Cash.  The fucking guy confused me.  At least give a name.  It's fucking.  He looks more like him than that fucking Phoenix.  Stinks.  I like the.  Cheech Marin as what?  I like to walk the line.  I didn't mind that.  He looked sounded and sang nothing like the man.  I didn't mind that.  Well, we can't talk about American Idol.  We don't have enough time to talk about American Idol.  I'll say Bucky's gone, though.  Bucky's gone?  No.  One of the chicks.  What about that Jay Leno-looking gray hair? 
[03:27:30]  He is on there until the end.  America loves him.  Really?  We love Taylor Hicks.  The Rubes love him.  I'm saying one of the broads go.  Lisa?  Yeah.  Lisa Tucker?  We know their names.  How pathetic is this?  Lisa Tucker goes tonight.  How pathetic this is, please.  Lisa Tucker or Bucky.  And Judah's gig next Thursday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The 20th or the 30th?  30th.  At 830.  The shithole.  23rd and what?  It's 23rd, the new Gotham Comedy Club between 7th and 8th.  And I got a lot of other shows. 
[03:28:00]  I've been out of town working a lot, but now I'm in town in New York for the next couple months.  What's the number?  We don't know.  212-367.  Program complete.  I don't know.  I'm in town.  We don't know.  I know.  I don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know. 
[03:28:30]  What's the number? </pre>
