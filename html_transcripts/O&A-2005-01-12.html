<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with advertisements for a "Better Sex Kit" and a "Wow Sticker Stop" in New Orleans, followed by a gleeful, profanity-laced celebration of a large FCC fine levied against the show.  The infamous "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (WoW) segment then encouraged female listeners to flash their WoW stickers displayed on vehicles.  Technical difficulties with their internet connection and passwords ensued, with the hosts blaming incompetent IT staff using highly offensive language.  News stories – light snow in New York, a California mudslide, plane crashes, and a caller, Max the Trucker, recounting an Oklahoma City tornado – were discussed, with the hosts commenting on the absurdity of people living in disaster-prone areas.  The show then touched upon the "Faces of Death" video and its modern online equivalents.

A substantial portion focused on updates regarding NYConfidential.com, an escort service whose owner, Jason, became a fugitive after a police raid.  Opie and Anthony recounted their experiences with the service, detailing sexual encounters with the agency's women, and humorously speculated on Jason's whereabouts and legal troubles.  Further caller interactions and discussions about the Playboy Radio show and its hosts followed.

A major segment addressed a feud with Playboy Radio personalities Julie and Tiffany.  The hosts played audio clips of Playboy Radio's criticism of the O&A show, followed by their apparent apology, alongside audio of the O&A Army’s retaliatory phone call barrage.  Callers detailed their participation, and the hosts discussed a Playboy Radio producer’s anger over being unacknowledged.  The hosts played sound clips, including a news reporter falling during a live broadcast, discussed listener activity on their website and forums, and mentioned upcoming appearances, including one in Illinois.  A call about the actor who played young Will Robinson in *Lost in Space* appearing in pornography was discussed, accompanied by clips featuring Dr. Smith.  The upcoming appearance of Al Franken was mentioned, along with a discussion on his political leanings. The hosts declared the conflict with Playboy Radio (temporarily) over and celebrated their listeners' actions.  Studio staff member Steve, known for his flamboyant clothing, was also prominently praised.  Frequent vulgar language was used throughout.

A significant portion of the show involved playing clips from *Lost in Space*, focusing on comedic interpretations of Dr. Smith as a pedophile.  The hosts repeatedly played clips, highlighting lines interpreted as suggestive or inappropriate interactions between Dr. Smith and young Will Robinson.  This was followed by a phone call with "Lady Di," who was subjected to aggressive mocking and insults from the hosts regarding her weight, drinking habits, parenting skills, and lack of knowledge about the New York Yankees and The Beatles.  The conversation became extremely vulgar and personal.  An upcoming call from Al Franken was briefly mentioned.  Commercial breaks, a sports segment about Pac-10 basketball on XM Satellite Radio, and a humorous song about a gerbil were interspersed.

A recurring segment with "Lady Di" continued, featuring further ridicule and insults from the hosts.  Her personal life and relationship with her son were discussed in a negative and demeaning way.  Al Franken then called in.  The hosts recounted the "Lady Di" segment to Franken, who expressed discomfort with the use of the word "retarded," leading to a discussion on politically correct language.  Franken and the hosts discussed the 2004 election, the Iraq War, the role of the media, and various political figures, including George W. Bush, Ann Coulter, and Barack Obama.  Franken also mentioned upcoming appearances and shared anecdotes from his USO tour.  "Whip-em Out Wednesday" was announced, and there were various advertisements, and a short discussion about Randy Johnson's reaction to a cameraman.  The show concluded with more banter between the hosts and a reference to a potential Joe Rogan call-in, all with frequent profanity and offensive language.

The final segment began with a discussion of Howard Stern's seemingly ambivalent "I don't care" attitude.  A car chase on television briefly distracted the hosts.  They wished Howard Stern a happy 55th birthday.  The show featured the farewell of intern Noah, whose sexual encounter with a porn star was repeatedly mentioned, along with the departure of another intern, Mike.  The hosts humorously recounted various past interns' antics and excuses, including fabricated car accidents and injuries.  A detailed account of an intern grilled for two hours about a false car accident claim was given.  A new intern, Travis, explained his lateness by setting his alarm for 3 PM instead of 3 AM; he was subsequently mocked.  A call-in segment followed, where listeners shared what they learned that day, often referencing the show's content with sexually suggestive and offensive humor.  The show concluded with advertisements for XM satellite radio and Major League Baseball.

[00:01:30]  XM 202  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Let's see what we got here.  I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story.  And I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen.  It's Opie and Anthony and we're back live in New York.  Pay attention.  They spark controversy.  Fuck you!  Being able to do the show we want to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight, kid.  Jesus fucking Christ!  One of the biggest fines in FCC history has slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You've got a couple of great guys over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money.  Yay, man! 
[00:05:00]  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks!  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the pass party.  Get your cock out.  You know the holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, vile women.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  V.O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:05:30]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Make sure you use that new clip wisely, Anthony.  I'm not gonna go throwing it around willy-nilly.  Make sure you use it wisely.  My mule.  He would have an enormous schwanstucker.  What knockers!  Why don't you stop playing with yourself, will you? 
[00:06:00]  That's terrific!  That's terrific!  Hello, exactly!  You have something to say.  I have something to say, all right?  So let's just talk.  You're not being fair!  This is a-  This is a giant cock.  Do you know what a boob is?  Nice.  But enough of this palaver! 
[00:06:30]  Let's get the show on the road!  All right, let's get the show on the road.  This is the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  And it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  I don't think we've talked about WoW in the last few weeks.  It is indeed.  Because we're in the middle of winter on the East Coast anyway.  So for us, it's like, WoW, whatever.  But it is a national radio show.  And there are some very, very nice warm areas that could probably celebrate WoW today.  Of course!  I mean, there are people listening to us in Miami, Arizona, Vegas, Texas, Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Very nice.  So I guess we have to go through all the BS about WoW for those fine people in the warm  areas.  Mm-hmm.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday is a great concept.  You place a WoW on your car or your truck.  We don't care how it gets there.  It could be one of our stickers.  You could go to our website to get the info on how you could get a WoW sticker.  Or you could make a homemade WoW sticker.  Or you could write it on the back of your truck in the dirt. 
[00:07:30]  Just get the WoW in your car.  And then what happens?  Ladies that feel like it, they see the WoW, they will flash you when you drive around this  fine nation of ours.  Ladies.  Right?  Oh, I have no internet.  That sucks.  What happens?  That's big.  Yeah, we kind of need internet for the radio show.  And what is the address around here?  111 57th Street, New York, New York.  Isn't there a West?  Oh, give me that envelope.  That might have the address on it. 
[00:08:00]  Sweet 500.  This one just got through with an easy address.  Okay, yeah.  For your WoW stickers, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Attention, WoW stickers.  111 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  10019.  Better known as 10019, right?  And that's for your WoW stickers.  Also, just a couple housekeeping things.  Yeah.  We get a lot of email from you guys.  A lot. 
[00:08:30]  We read every single piece of email.  Trust me on that.  We just can't write everyone back.  So don't think your email is going to waste.  All right?  A lot of people like to comment about the show.  They like to send in stuff for the radio show.  We read every single piece of email.  Okay?  We certainly do.  And just something, because people get confused.  If you have something for the show, like a video clip, audio clips that you think we might want to use on the radio show, that's all great.  But if you're sending it to my account, opie at opieandanthony.com, for some reason I can't transfer files to Steve. 
[00:09:00]  So just send it directly to Steve.  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's steve at foundrymusic.com for your video clips.  I don't know the password.  And the audio clips that we might use on the show.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Fucking shit.  What's wrong?  I don't like when stuff doesn't work.  And I don't know what the password is for any of this god-awful crap they put in here.  Watch me.  I know my password.  Yeah.  This week.  How about when it changes mysteriously?  Because for some reason, it's the CIA, XM. 
[00:09:30]  I'm letting it in on a big secret.  The XM satellite radio is a front.  It is actually the Central Intelligence Agency.  And passwords have to be changed every week on our computers.  Because, God forbid, someone breaks in and downloads a Kajagoogoo song.  I got my internet.  My password will expire in two days.  It says it right there.  It's giving me a warning.  I got my internet.  Unbelievable.  Let me go to yahoo.com, see what's going on in the news today. 
[00:10:00]  Look at that.  There was a second gunman.  I just hit something and got a website.  You know, it is ridiculous.  One of the files containing the systems registry has...  Hey, what?  I just want to look at pornography and instant feedback.  Why?  Why can't I...  Is it going to work?  It is pretty ridiculous.  I think I have a website coming up. 
[00:10:30]  I had to use the backup computer with no favorites.  Anthony and I pretty much don't have any secrets, so I don't think we really need to change our passwords every two weeks.  I don't need to change the password.  It's, you know, there's just a bunch of geeks that run this company.  Total geek heaven.  We're in geek hell, not heaven.  Well, for them, it's heaven.  We're in geek hell.  The geeks have taken over the world.  We know that by now, and they certainly have taken over this company.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Steve, I'm raising my hand for Steve. 
[00:11:00]  Could you come here and put the address in for the instant feedback?  Yeah, okay.  Because it's in my favorites on this computer, but not on this computer.  Not the backup one.  I put it in 20 times on this computer, but for some reason, every time it goes on,  it just gets eliminated.  I don't think we beat up the geeks good enough when we were in high school.  No.  No, they deserved that ass-kicking.  Oh, we beat them up.  Just for this.  We beat them up, but we needed to give them brain damage, because now they're getting their revenge. 
[00:11:30]  This is complete revenge.  There is no reason to change those passwords around like that.  None!  It's just because geeks get bored, and they need to stimulate their brains.  They're like, I know what we'll do.  They know damn well you won't know what's going on when you need to change your password,  and you'll need them.  They're guaranteeing the longevity of their job, is what they're doing,  by adding these stupid little things in.  It's guaranteeing that they will always have a purpose and a need.  They're putting in things, like how they put in the little backdoor entrances to the computer programs. 
[00:12:00]  That's what they do in life.  They put in little things where they are constantly needed and necessary.  Computers can be so much easier than they are.  Really, they can.  Especially here.  Well, someone's got to just make sure all the computers are up and running before we walk into the studio every morning.  Yeah.  Because now we just wasted ten minutes on that when we could have been talking about the fine winter coverage we're getting here in New York. 
[00:12:30]  Oh.  There was a little dusting.  Non-issue.  I'm sure there's other areas in the New York area that got some snow, but in the tri-state region, outlying areas of Manhattan, just a dusting.  But they got the stupid rapports out there with their Channel 7 ski jackets.  Oh, they got the heavy coats on like it's a blizzard.  It's a non-issue.  It was a dusting.  And the way the news covers it, they get on there before it even starts snowing. 
[00:13:00]  And they go, snowstorm headed for our area.  But you don't really realize our area includes miles.  Miles.  It includes, I think, three states.  Yeah, three states.  So they say that, and meanwhile you're in New York City and you assume they're talking about the city.  Three states.  New York.  Oh, four.  New York, Connecticut, Jersey, and Staten Island.  Staten Island's a state.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, they mean like northwestern Jersey and upstate New York. 
[00:13:30]  So they talk about it like it's a big storm coming.  And then you wake up, you look out the window, nothing.  But there was a little dusting that they showed on the news.  And this woman's standing in it, like you said, in her big jacket and everything.  It's not an issue.  I think the news channels are just jealous that we don't get what's going on in the rest of the country.  We don't get the tsunamis here.  We don't get those.  Tsunamis.  That insane like.  Mudslides.  You can't even call it a mudslide. 
[00:14:00]  Have you seen the footage of that?  Yeah, it's a dirt slide.  It's a river of dirt.  Where's the mud in that?  That whole mountain just like, just like liquefied.  It let loose on top of a bunch of houses.  It looks like it liquefied, but it didn't look wet.  No.  It was just dirt, trees, grass, rocks just coming, tumbling down that hill.  Did you see the pictures in the paper today?  Yeah.  Took out what, 10 to 12 homes like it was nothing?  A bunch of houses just covered them up.  They're digging, looking for survivors.  Survivors.  I feel bad for those people out there. 
[00:14:30]  I really do.  But the reality is, people choose to live in these crazy areas.  You've been in California enough.  It's nutty.  You know, they know this is going to happen eventually, but they're like,  I got a great view.  I got a, you know, it's a nice neighborhood.  I got the house cheap, you know.  There was a problem with that same hill like a couple of years ago, they said.  95.  Yeah.  And they blamed it on, they sued the county.  You sue the county.  You build a house on the side of a mountain that's letting loose every few years.  And then you sue the county because your house gets bowled over by dirt. 
[00:15:00]  Dude, not even let loose every few years.  When you're around in California and you go to some of these neighborhoods, they're everywhere.  Yeah.  I mean, there's stuff falling all the time.  A rock here, a rock there.  They build them up on stilts on the side of a mountain.  Well, but they got all these, like, you know, the nets and stuff to prevent the stuff going on to the highways.  Because it's just constantly falling.  Yeah.  And then eventually, or every once in a while, you get a major slide like they had a couple days ago. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And you know those people in the houses that, like, last week were watching the tsunami coverage, just going,  Oh, that's awful.  Oh, I'm glad things like that don't happen here.  And then there you are, a bunch of dirt coming through your window, swallowing up the family dog and your kids.  Wonderful.  You've got to be nuts to live there.  And people that live there say you're nuts to live here because of the crime, I guess, is what they've always pegged on New York.  Which was really bad when we were growing up.  Yeah, well, it's not anymore.  No. 
[00:16:00]  Your damn weather and stuff is still the same over there.  That ain't never going to change.  You can move to California.  You've got to be prepared for earthquakes, mudslides, and flooding.  Yeah, and they'll hose off that neighborhood and they'll just rebuild.  Oh, that's right.  You'll see new houses go up there.  They'll just rebuild in the exact same area.  Yeah.  And they might, you know, put up a, I don't know, a phone, a snow fence or something.  A snow fence.  If you look at that footage, there was nothing humans could build that was going to stop that.  But, you know, people will need to feel secure. 
[00:16:30]  So they're like, no, no.  They did that up in Niagara Falls.  They cleaned up, what was it, Love.  Oh, Love Canal?  Love Canal.  And people are moving back into that neighborhood.  Are people actually moving back in there?  Yeah.  They have convinced people that it's now safe again up there in some of those areas.  I guess they figure people forget.  It's still, yeah.  I mean, that was toxic waste.  That ain't going to go away.  Dude, when I lived in Buffalo, that was like a field trip to take. 
[00:17:00]  You get really drunk or high.  Creepy.  And then you drive through those neighborhoods.  Back then, you could.  I don't know if they fenced off a lot of them, but you could.  And it's just like, what happened to all the people?  All deserted.  It's all deserted.  Right, right.  There's weeds coming through the streets.  And then you got little, like, children's toys still in some of the yards, like the little  basketball hoops and stuff.  Creepy.  And the driveways that you knew were really nice now have weeds growing out of them.  And shutters are kind of falling off just enough. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  You know, it was really creepy.  Oh, that sounds cool.  It was definitely cool to check out.  Good place to go and drink.  Just hang out and get freaked out.  Right.  Enough time goes by and people assume it's safe again.  All right, well.  They will.  They'll put up one of those railroad tie-like retaining walls that'll just be bowled over  if they have another mudslide.  But people will go, oh, see, they did something.  Right.  Oh, by the way, a very happy birthday to Howard Stern today.  I believe he's 55 years old today. 
[00:18:00]  Is it?  Wow.  That went fast.  55, I think.  I know he's closer to 60 than 40, but whatever.  Happy birthday to Howard.  Want to acknowledge one of our enemies today and his little birthday.  Ah, happy birthday to me.  I don't care.  Max the Trucker.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Sugar Pants.  Hi, Max.  I live in Oklahoma City where they had that F5 tornado back in 99.  Yeah.  And you see these crazy bastards that live there in mobile home parks and shit. 
[00:18:30]  And they throw fucking car tires on top of the roof thinking that's going to help.  Car tires?  Yeah, supposedly it weighs the roof down so the wind won't blow it off.  Oh, yeah, that's going to work in a tornado.  Yeah, that's the fake security we talk about.  Everyone wants to feel secure, but the reality is we're not secure from tornadoes.  But my neighbor across the street, I was about 500 yards from that tornado when it hit down  in the damn basement, like, sticking my head between my legs, fixing to kiss my ass goodbye. 
[00:19:00]  And it's almost part of his house was about knee high when we finally came out.  What I don't understand about, like, Tornado Alley and all that, it hits, you see the coverage  on the news all the time, it hits the trailer parks, right?  Uh-huh.  Trailer parks all have wheels, right?  Yeah.  Or trailers.  Yes.  Why do you choose to live in these areas?  You can drive your trailer anywhere.  It don't make any sense to me, but then you've got these crazy bastards that chase them.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  They've got to run after and try to...  Yeah, they saw Twister too many times.  I love those guys, though.  When they show that stuff on TV, you know, these guys that chase them for a living, it's  pretty damn cool.  Yeah, I love watching the footage, but the guys seem like real tools.  And that movie, Twister, was ridiculous.  I went with them one time to do that, man.  Them bastards, they just run over fences and go through, like, pitches and shit.  Awesome.  We're extreme, man.  We're extreme.  We're chasing tornadoes, man.  We're extreme. 
[00:20:00]  Punch it out.  We're coming up Highway 3, man.  Come on, man.  You're going to miss it, man.  I hate that.  That extreme, we're tornado chasers.  And in the movie, they look a lot like, I don't know, it looks a lot cooler than it really  is.  It's just these nerds driving around in their pickup trucks with a little wind sensor on  the roof.  We've got to get a video camera.  We've got to get that clip from Harry and Kumar.  We're extreme, man.  Well, that's what's going on. 
[00:20:30]  Snow coverage is stupid.  Mudslide footage is pretty wild.  Yeah.  I missed the plane crash footage.  I was going to tell you, yeah, on CNN, I haven't seen it since.  A Cessna outside Orlando, Florida, was trying to do an emergency landing on a golf course.  Sounds reasonable.  Oh, right there.  We just missed it.  Damn it.  We just missed it.  Damn it.  Ben went right to CNN being quick on his feet, but we missed.  By a half a second.  I don't know if it hit a power line or something, because it was coming in nice, it looked like, 
[00:21:00]  and then all of a sudden it just cartwheeled into a telephone pole.  It looked like, I don't know the story, it looks like the guy's going to be okay, or whoever  was in the plane.  Yeah.  But the plane was right next to a car just driving.  This car is just driving down the little country road, minding its own business, probably  looking at the view of the golf course, not really knowing what's going on.  And this plane was literally right next to the passenger window.  Wow.  You've got to see the footage.  It's pretty cool.  I just love, love living during these times. 
[00:21:30]  You get all this footage every morning now.  Every dope has a video camera out at a golf course.  What the hell were they videotaping before the plane came down?  I don't know.  I think it was some kind of news helicopter that was either in the area or found out that  this plane was in trouble.  So they decided, hey, we might as well get good footage of the crash.  You ever see the footage of the plane that's crashing?  I think it's in the Indian Ocean.  It was hijacked years ago, and they wanted them to fly somewhere.  And the pilot's like, look, we don't have the gas to do this.  It's like a major airliner.  Oh, yeah.  And they're hitting the ocean.  It's really moving. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of them actually survived.  767.  Does a little cartwheel.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, nasty.  A lot of those people lived.  One of the ones that was unbelievable was that one that crashed.  I think it was Iowa and Nebraska in the cornfield.  United DC-10.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Just flipping on fire.  And people walked away from that one.  A lot of people walked away.  Jeez, get out of here.  Come on.  The pilots survived that one too, right?  Yes, all of them.  And there was a pilot in first class who flew for them that they called up to the front 
[00:22:30]  to help.  Yeah, he had a lot of experience with the aircraft because they lost their hydraulics.  They weren't able to steer the plane in any way but using the engines on the wings, the  two engines on the wings.  There wasn't one on the tail.  The tail one blows up, sends metal through their hydraulic lines.  Now they have no control of the plane.  So all they could do is give a little more power to the left engine or the right engine  to try to steer it.  So they're bringing it in.  And they did a great job right up to the runway.  And then they went to land and one side tipped a little lower. 
[00:23:00]  Well, they had to cut the engines.  Because they were coming in.  They had to cut the engine.  They were coming in too fast to land.  And when they cut it, it just drifted a little bit.  Sideways, wham, boom, flame.  They all should have died, though.  I mean, that type of a thing.  It was a design from the DC-10 where both of their backups were blown, too.  30,000 feet with no control.  They all should have been dead.  You don't see many big airliner videos of them crashing.  But the few that they have.  I mean, there's some FAA sites and stuff you go to.  Do you ever see the one where the guy couldn't quite get off the runway and runs into a big 
[00:23:30]  forest of trees?  Trees, yeah, yeah, yeah.  God damn.  It's amazing to watch.  That was a test flight, right?  Yeah, I think so.  Very voyeuristic.  And with all the stuff that's out there now on the internet, you can see whatever you want,  whether you want to or not.  Like, a lot of people are into this goddamn, like, remember when Faces of Death was the  biggest thing you get?  You get your buddies together, you pop in that tape and sit there, you know, and just  you're horrified.  You know, that was like the most extreme you can get. 
[00:24:00]  And looking back, that was nothing.  It was fake, a lot of it.  A lot of it was very fake.  The electrocution on it?  That was never filmed.  I know, never filmed.  The monkey.  That's the famous one.  The little monkeys where they were eating the monkey brains, and they showed the rich  people sitting at the table with the monkey head through the table, and they were hitting  the monkey on the head with a little chrome hammer to break his skull, and he's alive  because you want the brains fresh.  And then they showed him scooping out this gelatinous material into their mouth.  But it was all fake. 
[00:24:30]  They never really showed anyone cracking the monkey on the head.  Yes, Eric?  Do you remember back in the days when Beavis and Butthead were on MTV real late at night?  They used to show the ads for Faces of Death saying it was banned in the United States,  yet they're selling it to you right there in the United States on TV.  It was fake.  A lot of it was fake.  The only real stuff was the news footage that they showed.  And there was a lot of plane crash aftermath things.  There was some, what was that, PSA Airlines or something in San Diego?  Up in midair or something, right?  Yeah, and just littered a neighborhood with body parts where it was up on rooftops, torsos 
[00:25:00]  in the street, and they were showing that, and that was really disturbing.  It was a midair crasher thing.  Yeah.  Midair crash.  And just, yeah, littered a whole neighborhood with body parts.  So that stuff.  And that was the most extreme you could get.  But now, log on.  Anything you want to see is right there.  You want to see plane crashes?  Boom.  Right at your fingertips.  To Ogresh.com.  To Ogresh.com.  To Ogresh.com.  Huh?  To Ogresh.com.  O-G-R-I-S-H.  Yeah.  They have all these vicious, awful videos.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For free.  Like I said before, I like the smut. 
[00:25:30]  I don't like the death and destruction.  Well, smut's coming to the cell phones.  Is it?  Yeah, Playboy.  Get out of here.  Well, you know that the phones are just about there.  Yeah.  Just about there.  I mean, they're just...  Just enough to piss you off when you don't get what you really want.  Well, the camera phones, you know, in the next year, I think are going to get a lot better.  Five megapixel I saw on a camera.  Right.  Jimmy.  Always asking how many megapixel.  Jimmy is the biggest megapixel snob ever. 
[00:26:00]  If you have a camera, he'll be like, oh, that's nice.  How many megapixels?  And you go four, and he's, oh, not impressed.  Not impressed.  That's why I won't get the cell phones with the cameras in them, because those are not...  It's such a waste.  I mean, well, now they're coming out with the, you know...  We've got five megapixel flashes with the camera phones.  Five megapixel.  Camera phone?  On a camera phone.  Because they have it.  You know they have it.  They just wait until every dummy, like me included, buys this, and then they just come out with  a new one.  A new one.  That's what they do.  Well, Playboy is getting really smart. 
[00:26:30]  Playboy has found a new way to peddle its nude pictures to gawkers on the go over their cell  phones, Anthony.  Color screens on the new generation of handhelds are perfect for beautiful pictures, said Playboy.com  editor, John Thomas.  Last month, Playboy also joined the growing legion of porn purveyors, marketing to handheld  devices when it launched iBod, nude photos sized for the iPod photo.  Does the producer for Playboy radio show get upset that we didn't take pictures of him  with the satellite phone? 
[00:27:00]  With the camera phone?  Yeah, that thing got messed up, man.  I mean, we're going to have a Playboy update after the break.  Yes, an update.  Yeah, the girls did the right thing and decided they didn't want to get into a battle with  us.  No?  No.  We got some audio.  Is it?  So we'll finish that storyline that we starred yesterday.  Storyline?  Well, we were talking in the office.  This show's becoming like a soap opera.  There's storylines that we have to finish.  So weaved together.  Yeah, it's just a, it's, I don't know, it's like a soap opera.  That's how people get addicted to it. 
[00:27:30]  They turn it on and they're like, who are these idiots?  And the next thing you know, they can't stop listening to it.  That's how you get hooked.  Yeah, the first, when you listen to someone's critique of this show after just a day or  maybe two days of listening, they get all pissed off.  They're like, yeah, they're talking about, I don't know who they're talking about or what  they're saying, a lot of inside jokes.  Then after a couple of weeks, you know, it's done.  The best part of the show.  Now you know some of the inside stuff and it pisses you off that, you know.  The best part of the show is the inside jokes.  When you're in on that gag, we used to explain everything, remember?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  We just got, we just got lazy and it worked.  We don't care.  It worked in our, it worked in our favor.  Yeah.  You know, because when you're in on the inside jokes, then the show makes a lot more sense.  Of course it does.  You literally can't miss a minute of this program.  No.  We refer to Monster Rain all the time, but if you don't know what Monster Rain is, you know,  you're out.  Is there anyone listening to this show that doesn't know what Monster Rain is?  We had probably another, I'm guessing, well, I can't say the numbers, unfortunately, but  there's a lot of people that are signing up every day. 
[00:28:30]  I know.  There are people hearing us for the first time today.  And we've been doing this over three months already.  You think the first time today?  Or maybe they listened with a friend and decided to get their own.  There's definitely people are hearing us for the first time today.  If you want, call us up and prove it.  If this is the first time you're hearing us, give us a call.  You have no idea what donkey sausage means.  You have no idea what Chester means.  I still don't know what donkey sausage means.  You don't understand the Javalog thing.  I mean...  I still don't understand the Javalog thing. 
[00:29:00]  Relax.  Javalog.  There are a lot of people who understand the Javalog thing.  Hey, let's go to Joe in Philly.  Joe?  Unfortunately, they all work for the Gay Men's Health Crisis.  Easy.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Woo!  How do you do, Joe?  Find the room comfortable.  This is actually Joe from Philly.  I met you guys a couple times.  Ah.  Oh.  But I sent you guys a couple.  You're talking about the websites you have to look at.  I sent the news yesterday.  Deathanddementia.com. 
[00:29:30]  Why would I go there?  AbortionTV.com.  Why would I want to go there?  Wait.  I want to go there.  Death and dementia?  Dementia?  Deathanddementia.com.  And abortion-tv.com.  And I can only imagine what's on that.  Wait.  Abortion what?  Abortion-tv.  Like this little hyphen signal.  Dot com?  Yep.  Dot com.  Wait.  Hyphen.  Is that a line that goes from left to right?  A hyphen? 
[00:30:00]  That's the minus sign.  Oh.  What's a hyphen?  That's a dash.  Not a slash.  Wait.  A dash?  Dash.  What's a dash?  A dash is a hyphen.  That's a line left to right.  Right.  That's what I said.  Like that?  Yeah, that's right.  Like the thing in between Rodham and Clinton.  Uh.  Alright.  But yeah, I sent something to you guys yesterday to your email.  Okay, cool.  Alright, man.  Thank you.  See you guys. 
[00:30:30]  See, we don't want people to know that we're really smart.  Uh, Dan from Maine, what's up?  We are?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Yeah, what's up, Dan?  Uh, yeah.  I fly for the U.S. Navy.  I've got a website for you guys to go to if you want to see some nasty shit.  Okay, go ahead.  Uh, do a search.  I'm not exactly sure of it.  It's for the Naval Safety Center.  Naval Safety Center?  Yeah, there's all kinds of sick downloads on there.  You know, plane crashes.  People that, you know, get fingers torn off from having, you know, wearing rings.  Is that the guy?  Do they also have the guy that was sucked into the engine on the deck of a carrier? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, that was actually on a, I was on the boat when that happened.  It was on 97 on USS Theodore Roosevelt.  Every guy that's in the Navy says that he was there when that happened.  Uh, no, I was in, uh, Strike Fighter Squad in 87 when that happened.  All right.  All right, guys.  I'll punch you out.  Thank you.  Later.  There's some poor guy on the deck.  I've seen that one.  Walks in front of the engine.  And wham, he just gets sucked right in.  Go on.  Nasty.  All right.  Um, so we got to take a quick break.  We'll get the Playboy update. 
[00:31:30]  We'll finish that little soap opera that started yesterday.  Also, Anthony, um, we got, uh, the first season of Lost in Space that is basically proving  something we have talked about for years, that Dr. Zachary Smith was a, um, a pedophile.  I was not.  Oh, well, we got some.  You will be molested.  We got some clips.  Where did that come from?  You will be molested.  That's hilarious.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear. 
[00:32:00]  So we got some examples of, uh, Dr. Zachary Smith being a pedophile.  Of course he was.  From the first season of Lost in Space.  Young, will you more tender and young like a bluff chicken?  Oh.  You will be molested.  How did they get away with him saying that?  I don't know.  They didn't care back then.  They didn't care.  They don't care.  So, as we go to break, a little something something.  Welcome to the third race at the honeymoon is over now. 
[00:32:30]  They're at the gate.  And they're off.  Jumping out in the lead is Romance and Affection, with Domestic Bliss in close behind.  It's Romance and Affection and Domestic Bliss.  Here comes Marriage Vows, followed by Immediate Child.  Romance and Affection falling off quickly.  Mortgaged up the ass, overtaking Domestic Bliss.  And here comes Nasty Attitude, followed by More Children and Drinking Heavily.  Coming down the backstretch, drinking heavily, moving out in front of Mortgaged up the ass.  But coming on strong on the outside is Credit in Shambles. 
[00:33:00]  It's Credit in Shambles, followed by I Don't Give a Shit.  Nasty Attitude and Up Yours Keep.  Up Yours Keep challenging for a second, going into the clubhouse turn.  Passing on the rail is I Don't Give a Shit taking the lead.  Followed by the fucking house.  You cook like shit and I fucked your brother.  Here they come, spinning out of the turn.  I Don't Give a Shit still in front.  Up Yours Keep challenging for the lead.  Up Yours Keep and I Don't Give a Shit neck and neck.  And down the stretch they come.  Up Yours Keep is pulling away from I Don't Give a Shit by a link.  Coming on strong is I Am Out of Here.  And passing the pack is the fucking house. 
[00:33:30]  End at the wire.  It's Up Yours Keep the fucking house.  I Don't Give a Shit and I Am Out of Here.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically it says,  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Down the left field line.  Is it enough?

So, self-addressed stamped envelope, XM Satellite Radio, 111 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  And just write attention WOW sticker or stickers and we'll send them out to you immediately, okay?  Now, we're going to do the Playboy update, but holy ass.  I think we all were at risk of being arrested for prostitution. 
[00:37:30]  No.  You never know, though.  Believe me, not that I had sex in that place that they raided.  Oh, really?  No, siri, Bob.  Never, ever, right?  I stopped by, I played cards.  You know how we were just saying how this show is kind of a soap opera?  Well, something we haven't talked about in a while was our friends at nyconfidential.com.  Right.  They came in.  I don't even know how we met them.  They just, how did we meet them, Ben?  Do you remember?  Give us a little background on how we hooked up. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, because it's been about two months since we talked about them.  Ben, I hope you want to ask some background questions.  Do you know?  Who knows?  I'm trying to remember.  I think they just contacted us.  Wanted to send girls down when we get back on the air, if I remember.  Yeah, they're huge fans of the show.  Jason, the guy who runs the place.  Jason, and they, it's like a dating service.  Refresh us on some of the girls that they sent down for us.  The first day they sent Natalia, who was the one that was in the back of New York Magazine  every week, and then there was that really hot, what was she, was she Russian or something? 
[00:38:30]  I don't even remember.  She was really hot, the tall one, 18 years old.  Well, Russian always better than anything American could possibly come up with, even the woman.  Even the woman better in Russia than American, you fat American woman, not even hold candle  to Russian, strong, beautiful Russian woman.  You know, Russian pompous asses they are.  So, the guy, what was his name, Jamie?  Jason. 
[00:39:00]  No, Jason, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Jason, big fan of the show, and sent some girls down.  They broke in our lesbian couch and did some things.  Right, I remember that.  And he was such a fan of the show that he decided to give us all a free hour.  Remember that?  He's the guy that was giving us the free hour.  The free hour.  Oh, I never redeemed mine.  Well.  And remember, he gave us those, like, silver cards that were, like, metal, that were, like,  really sharp.  Yeah, you could slit up the road with them.  Yeah, they were weapons.  They were like those Chinese stars.  Yeah.  And, well, thank God no one went for their free hour in the last few days. 
[00:39:30]  No one?  No, in the last few days.  Oh, okay.  I know Jim Norton got his free hour.  Jim Norton went down to this fine, fine apartment somewhere in New York City.  Dude, I'm such a dummy.  Because he, Jason, I love Jason.  Because there was no money exchange, actually.  What I did was completely legal, because it was just, he was a fan, so he was like,  yeah.  And I met up with Natalia, and he offered me, you know, she called her the next day  to give a report.  Yes.  Yes.  And I do believe you ate her ass.  Oh, like a champ.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:40:00]  And then he got sick.  That's right.  I remember that.  But it's not related.  Remember, Anthony?  You got the flu.  Yeah.  Ass flu.  You got ass flu.  You guys were also sick, though.  You guys were sick first.  You brought it in here.  No, I didn't.  You were sick before I was.  You both were.  I was sick the first 10 days of the show.  Yeah, but I didn't have ass flu.  I didn't either.  I don't think.  I had the worst flu the first 10 days of this XM show.  I don't even remember what we did the first two weeks.  I had it right before we started.  That's when I got mine.  Yeah.  But anyway, so you went to the place.  You ate her ass.  And Jason's like, I'll hook you up. 
[00:40:30]  Let me give you two girls.  He was so cool, this guy.  Of course he was cool.  Dude, he's like, let me hook you up with two.  I was like all nervous.  I'm like, ugh.  And he's like, I'm like, let me just do one the first time.  You know, I'm weird with this stuff, man.  And I wound up having a great time.  She was fed.  Sure.  A true GFE, as they say.  Girlfriend experience.  Girlfriend experience.  Kissing.  We did learn that.  She was really, really sexy.  Cuddling and snuggling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Because that's what you get from a girl the first date is a chance to eat her ass.  Right.  That's what a girlfriend experience is.  Well, it's girlfriend experience. 
[00:41:00]  Girlfriend experience.  It condenses your entire relationship into one hour.  I think girlfriend experience, I think it takes a minimum of four months to get to the  ass eating.  No, it condenses your entire relationship into one hour, where at the end you probably say,  I don't think we should see each other anymore.  A true girlfriend experience would be if you show up and she just nags you and you wind  up jerking off alone while you wish her dead.  But this was actually a really nice one.  A nice one?  Yeah, she was great.  Yeah, I remember.  He would often hook me up with two girls at a time. 
[00:41:30]  I'm so stupid for not capitalizing.  Although, it wouldn't surprise me if I had been in that place.  I'm kind of glad I wasn't there.  And the place was really, really nice, right?  It was just a beautiful, gorgeous apartment.  The music, the candles, the girls just lounging around.  A nice bar.  I mean, Jimmy doesn't drink, but a nice bar if you need some drinks.  Chicks, man.  Well, Anthony, I got to be honest.  When this was all going down and we were starting this relationship with nyconfidential.com,  I'm thinking, just a matter of time before this guy's going to get busted. 
[00:42:00]  Is he insane?  Well, he was doing some kind of reality show.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  No, he gave me a copy of the pilot.  I have a copy of the pilot at home somewhere.  Yeah, it was actually pretty decent where they were just kind of talking about what they do  and showing the girls and stuff.  Does he understand that prostitution is not legal in New York and Jersey  and perhaps he should be a little more discreet?  I guess it all depends on how you promote it.  I mean, you can pay someone for their time.  Yeah, well, that's true. 
[00:42:30]  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with having a little companionship.  What is a therapist, really?  Wow, this guy has an interesting record.  Wow, I didn't know they made that much money, too.  So here's our buddy, Jason.  We kind of got to know him the last few months.  I really like the guy.  And Norton has his cell number and all sorts of stuff  and went there for a little girlfriend experience.  A treat.  And I wanted to give my free hour away to either an intern or a listener  and then a lawyer lady down there in Washington, but a stop to that. 
[00:43:00]  Wisely.  You have to kind of give it to the XM lawyers on this one.  I guess I got to give it to her on this one.  Yeah, XM was correct.  You're right.  So this has hit the New York papers.  Pimp King Hunt.  They're hunting for him?  Yeah.  A notorious New York porn king is being sought by cops.  Notorious New York porn king.  That's a great title to have given to you.  Notorious New York porn king?  It's much cooler than shock jocks.  Exactly. 
[00:43:30]  I want to be known as notorious.  Notorious.  A notorious New York porn king is being sought by cops  who want to bust him for allegedly pimping call girls  in a multi-million dollar Manhattan operation.  Jason, 37, disappeared from his Hoboken home  after New York cops raided the Worth Street offices  of his New York confidential escort agency last Friday,  law enforcement sources said.  Jason is on parole from a New Jersey prison  where he served six months of a five-year sentence  for smuggling, holy yes, 3,869 hits of ecstasy 
[00:44:00]  on a flight from Amsterdam in 2001.  What is he, crazy?  3,869 hits.  During the raid, cops arrested six women.  I wonder if Natalia got arrested.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Who were the chicks who got arrested?  These girls were living high off the hog, too.  They were, like, jet-setting to L.A. with businessmen.  I mean, we got a bunch of good stories from them.  I heard him on the phone one time,  and again, I didn't know what was being said on the other end.  Of course.  But he was talking about sending girls, 
[00:44:30]  I forget for how many thousands of dollars  for, like, some lawyer for an hour and a half.  I heard him talking to his guy.  He's like, look, he's a good customer.  Just tell him it's, like, you know, $4,000 for the hour.  It was, like, that type of money, man.  They were real.  You guys got to understand.  We kind of, like, have a relationship with these guys.  During the raid, cops arrested six women  and a man who worked at New York Confidential  on such charges as promoting prostitution,  money laundering, falsifying business records,  and criminal possession of a controlled substance.  Okay, and then blah, blah, blah. 
[00:45:00]  Customers called to order one of nearly 100 women  who signed on as contractors for the company  and paid average rates of $800 per hour  to have sex with them.  Higher-priced hookers could be had for up to $2,000 an hour.  Yep.  New York Confidential, whose ad in New York Magazine  boasts of being the ultimate girlfriend experience,  grossed an estimated $300,000 per month,  or $3.6 million annually.  I run a great agency.  I don't break the laws, said Jason, 
[00:45:30]  in the Post last month.  Oh, they interviewed him in the Post last month?  Yeah, there was...  Well, I actually ran on Craigslist.  They got busted last Friday.  I just didn't...  I thought it was just a rumor.  I've got the cops on my side.  I know everyone.  I know this...  Oh, what an idiot.  Oh, boy.  See, maybe you shouldn't say things like that.  Yeah, Jason, bad move, bro.  Look, we kind of know we got the cops on our side  and things like that,  but you don't brag about it.  I got your gun.  I got everything.  I've got the cops on my side.  I know everyone.  I know this industry.  I'm a lawyer.  I know what I can and can't do. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, boy.  He's a law school graduate, huh?  Yeah, but the problem is,  even if they can't get him on court,  they'll get him on tax evasion.  They can always get you on tax evasion.  They can always get you on that.  And then Jason has bragged in the past  about making millions  operating 900 telephone sex lines.  He first made waves in New York City  by setting up a faux fashion...  What?  A faux.  What?  Faux.  Faux, sorry.  Faux.  Fake.  Oh, thank you.  Let me start over.  He first made waves in New York City  by setting up a fake fashion model agency 
[00:46:30]  that was used to lure pretty women  into his real operation,  a cyber sex site featuring women  masturbating on camera  and chatting with clients over the internet.  It's harmless.  We know about a bunch of those guys, too, man.  Yeah.  We were first on that little gag  when we were working in Boston, remember?  God, I could have had threesomes.  I'm so stupid.  Jason's short tenure at that game  ended after he was forced out by partners  in 2001, just before his drug bust.  So there you go.  I am so stupid.  One of our pals is on the run. 
[00:47:00]  Dude, I could have had two of these tens together.  I'm just so not...  Dennis, who owns the Bunny Ranch,  is a good friend of mine,  and he's been talking about me coming out there  for over a year.  Really?  Probably a year and a half.  And he's like,  you know, hey,  come at all expenses.  And I just, I don't know,  I can't take advantage of somebody  when I know them.  It's like it's too scumbaggish  to capitalize on your French.  I'm really worried about that.  Yeah, I'd almost rather spend the money  than the kind of asking French.  Could have had it, though.  I am so stupid.  Now, you know.  Their site is still up, though.  The site's up? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  NYconfidential.com.  God, there were some hot girls.  I'm going to check out some of the chicks.  They have a whole list of girls over there.  Oh, man.  We've had, I don't know,  at least 10 of them in here.  They're all hot.  There's no ugly ones.  He's on the lam.  Maybe he's just on vacation.  You think?  Yeah.  No, he's gone, man.  He's gone.  He's running.  He knows.  If he's out on parole  on drug charges like that  and then he does this,  he'll go away for a while.  Someone like him who's a lawyer,  I bet you he had a plan in place. 
[00:48:00]  You think?  Yeah.  If I get busted,  I'll just do this.  If I get busted,  I'm out.  Take off with the cash.  Take off immediately  with the cash and a passport  to wherever.  Go to Thailand.  Why not?  Why not?  Tsunami ravaged Thailand.  So there's your update  on the NY Confidential.  It's Jimmy Chon.  He's checking on some people  right now.  Yeah, I'll give him a call.  I see him punching in his cell phone.  I tried calling him.  It goes right to voicemail.  Really?  Yeah.  Hi, I'm running from the police.  I want to leave a message. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe you could get in touch with him.  Give us an update.  That'd be nice.  All right.  The police would like to know  where he is.  Let's go to the phones  and say hi to Jeremy in Kansas.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Morning, Beast Pants.  How you doing, Angel?  That's really, really a harsh way  to speak to me.  Hey, there's a website  that you would like there,  little Jimmy.  It shows an Asian  chick that has diarrhea  shooting out like a fowl.  Yuck.  That was nothing for me. 
[00:49:00]  That was disgusting.  Yeah, that's awful.  Even I don't care for that, sir.  Oh, you're fine, too.  But what's the site  just in case?  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Let's go to the phones  and move on to something else.  Kyle from Ohio.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, Playboy Radio  last night was hilarious.  Why was it?  Those girls were sucking  your cock on the radio  last night.  They had the idea  that you should have 
[00:49:30]  Opie and Julie  and Tiffany  and Tiffany  and Tiffany  and Tiffany  and one of them  come out there  and one of you  go out there.  What, Switch Radio Partners?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Get the wacky horn  out for that one.  That's zing horrific.  Then they had the great idea  of both of them  doing your show  and you guys  doing their show  and just fool the listeners.  We kind of do their show  and everyone else's show  all at the same time. 
[00:50:00]  We touch on the sex thing.  We do a very good job at it  and then we do other things.  Then we do current events.  Then we do a little  Sean Hannity.  Give you a little  Playboy Radio  and then we give you  a little Sean Hannity.  There you go.  Maybe a little CNN,  right, Ope?  A little CNN.  Sure.  Well, then they had  That's what makes us great.  We could do anything.  A couple callers  got through  before they started  basically really  sorting out callers.  Like one person said  that Chester wanted  to join in  in a menage a pro.  Oh, I heard that one.  Chester? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, really?  We're trying to get the audio.  We should have it  in a few minutes here.  It's on Wackbag, actually.  That'd be funny.  Wackbag.com?  Yes.  Wackbag.com,  one of our message boards  has some of the audio  from last night's show.  I got to laugh at it.  They had one guy  last night  that called in  and they asked him,  oh, what are you  calling in for?  He said,  I don't know.  Someone called me  to tell me  you needed listeners  or you needed callers  so I called in.  Nice.  They were actually  having people  call in for them  because they were scared  all of the callers  on the line.  Right. 
[00:51:00]  Well, I know someone,  let's just say  donkey sausage chick  I talked to online  and she's like,  I'm on hold.  Well, no, no,  just, you know,  it was business,  of course.  And she said  she was on hold.  I was on hold  for an hour.  That doesn't shut up.  That doesn't shut up.  All right,  that doesn't shut up.  Thanks, man.  Well, you see,  I was going to him  to start the  Playboy conversation.  Well, that's good.  That's real good  that you were going there.  What?  So I was,  Yeah,  and what I did 
[00:51:30]  was I listened last night.  Anyway, Anthony,  so the,  Yeah,  and then someone called  and they said  donkey sausage  and we're talking  about Chester the dog.  Well, I was on hold.  I was talking to you.  And then another guy  called up  as I just step  on everything you say  and interrupt you  like a complete tool.  God,  don't you understand  how this show works?  She said that she was  on hold for like 45 minutes  and then the guy  got on the line with her  and goes,  look,  you have to call back tomorrow.  We're having a problem  with some other show  or something. 
[00:52:00]  That was some issue.  But what I didn't think,  I only heard a minute  of Julie and Tiffany  and what I heard,  they didn't sound  like they were kissing anybody.  They said something along,  like somebody had called  and it said something  and she's like,  and that's exactly  the type of guy  that calls that show.  That's all I really heard  of them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, Anthony,  so let's set this up.  What happened now  with the Playboy girl?  Oh, my goodness.  We talked to them at CES  and we thought  we got along with them  and the first caller,  because we're thinking  they're radio savvy, 
[00:52:30]  was a caller  that just didn't like  the sex advice they give.  So we figured  we'd have some fun  with the guy,  but they took it  as we were setting them up  and possibly it was  one of our guys  calling in,  which it just wasn't.  It was just like  a ton of phones  on the screen  and I just made  a split-second decision.  Let's just go to this guy  to start this off.  That's all that it was.  There you go.  A conversation starter,  right?  A conversation starter.  So then they took it  the wrong way  and trashed us  and then their producer  was all pissed off  that we didn't  acknowledge him  or something.  I don't even remember  meeting the producer 
[00:53:00]  of their show.  I don't know.  Because I guess like  then the following day  at the porn convention  we had to move locations.  Yeah.  We were at this  real nice convention center  and then we went  to the Venetian  the next day  and Jaime was there  who's just a huge supporter  of the Opie and Anthony show  and there was another guy  working with him  that supposedly  was some kind of  playboy producer  or whatever.  And he was helping Jaime out  that we met the day before.  I don't know.  We meet so many people.  And his big problem  was that we didn't  he was like 
[00:53:30]  yeah I was standing  right there  as they were doing the show  and they didn't even  you know acknowledge me.  Like what?  We didn't talk to Jaime either.  We just went hey man  and that was it.  Yeah.  We were doing a show.  And quite honestly  I don't remember  meeting you.  Sorry.  That's what it comes down to.  He looked busy.  He was plugging stuff in.  If he would have walked up  and said hello  I'm the engineer  nobody would have  done anything  but been nice to him  and said oh hey man  nice to meet you.  Nobody would have been rude.  It was just  you're kind of in that zone  where you're trying to make sure 
[00:54:00]  look we're in an outdoor space here  we're in a big room.  Yeah.  You want to make sure  that this doesn't suck  because we're on a  right on the carpet  where people are going to be  walking by with a round table.  We don't know  we're not used to doing this.  I think he was like  the big dick out of this whole thing  was him.  Yeah I think so.  And I think the girls  got into something  because he started some  some crap.  I don't know.  So we called  we called in a  assault last night.  We do that from time to time.  We have a huge O&A army  and they wait for  they wait for marching orders 
[00:54:30]  and we decided  to attack last night  and I guess it got  quite fun  on their  their show last night.  Right.  What are you looking at Anthony?  I'm just looking at  what's on the phones.  You want to go this way?  Sure.  Alright.  Doughboy.  What's going on boys?  From whackbag.com  what's going on?  It's actually kind of funny  how  non-fans  just don't get it  because that Chester call  somebody called up  just goofing  obviously  saying you know  Chester wants to  join in the fun  and then Tiffany or Julie  whatever  asswipe  answered 
[00:55:00]  was like  this is exactly  the type of  asswipe  caller  that calls  into that show  and then they went  into some rant  about how  they have rules  and there's no  bestiality  so they like  took it seriously  it was just  totally fucking gay.  Do we have the audio?  I heard that call  Yeah we're getting  the audio  Steve should have it  in here in a few seconds.  Alright thank you bro  let's go to Oklahoma  and say hi to Cliff  wow  the ONA Army  from all over the country  helping us out  on this one.  Yes Cliff.  What's happening fellas?  Hey 
[00:55:30]  I'm a new  ONA Army member  by the way  but last night  I was on hold  several times  and the last time  I was on hold  for about an hour and a half  and I got put on hold  as hoo hoo  because I was in a relationship  that I just didn't care about.  He goes  what's your name?  I said  hoo hoo  I said  hoo hoo  he goes  hoo hoo  I said  yeah  I don't care 
[00:56:00]  I don't care  I don't care  I just don't care  by the way guys  I was the one  I called in the other day  as Dave  when I nailed all three of you  Oh yeah  you did a good job of that  Very good  I appreciate it guys  you guys suck  have a good one  Thank you mister  Bye angel  That guy's hilarious  Doug out Doug  from whackbag.com  What's up?  Good morning gentlemen  How are we doing?  Pretty good  How did it go last night?  Oh it was wonderful  It was pure poetry emotion  We had an off site  off of whackbag meeting place  where we had the audio 
[00:56:30]  that happened to have been shared  so everybody could listen along  Wow  They got two phone calls  into the show  which is all phone calls anyway  They dumped every call  and never took another call  from someone they didn't know again  Wow  You know what's funny  about the ONA Army  and I mean  these guys  have such a thing set up  now they got like  other websites  and other areas to go  they got like  a meeting place  a staging area  and then they got  a monitoring area  that they can then go 
[00:57:00]  and listen in on the audio  Honestly this is stuff  we don't even know  how to get to these places  all of a sudden we call  in a strike  and they'll go  alright no more  no more posts  on the message board  you guys know where to go  wink wink  we'll see you there  That's it  This show has gone  so underground  it's not even funny  It's great  Good morning  my little motherless  semi-abortion  Hello cancer bosoms  Jesus  They were definitely  sucking your guys' cocks  last night  for the first five minutes  of that show  As well as they should  They did nothing 
[00:57:30]  but kiss up  and then we were  just relentless  Dude we said yesterday  even Howard doesn't want  to get into a battle  with us  trust me  I don't care  The playboy girls  do not want to  get into a battle  with us  Especially for no reason  we like them  and we don't want  to start a fight  with them  We pretty much  kissed their ass  during the interview  we liked them  we thought they  had some radio chops  they were pretty good  There you go  They were pretty good  Thanks bro  Do you guys actually  have the audio clips?  Yeah Steve  just handed them to me  Steve there  in his flaming Superman  shirt  Wow 
[00:58:00]  Look at that Steve  where'd you pick  that one up?

[00:59:00]  Well you know  the only space  I really have  on my arms left  is from the elbow down  you really have  to be committed  to get  Forearms  To get the forearms  You're committing  yourself to a lifestyle  and to limited  career options  when you do  the whole sleeve  A lifestyle  of being a bear  Yeah  You're so cozy  What kind of face  did he say he had?  I wish I could remember that  I can't remember  from yesterday right?  Friendly  Kind  Kind  Friendly  Loving  Warm  Comforting  All apropos  Yeah  Of course 
[00:59:30]  Thank you Jimmy  How cozy of you  Let's go to  Let's go to  Larry the Truss  See him by a fire  Larry  Yeah  Hey  Hey  I called in  to the Playboy channel  last night  I spoke with  Julie and Tiffany  Yeah  And I guess  one of their PDs  I asked her  what his name was  He said  He just referred  to himself  as their PD  So I guess  he was their  program  One of their  program directors  And they had  nothing but  good things to say  about you guys  All right  Very good  We talked about 
[01:00:00]  how they loved you guys  Can't wait to  do a show with you guys  and all this and that  So I don't know  what the deal is  with them girls  All right  You know  I think we might have  I don't know  I think we're all right  with them now  Right  Yeah  I just want to know  why they were  bash us to begin with  Boston Strangler  What's up?  Hey  Morning boys  Morning sweet kids  Good morning  Flower Bag  Well anyway  I was the second  caller that made  it through to  Julie and Tiffany  last night  I was Bernie  from Brooklyn 
[01:00:30]  Oh nice  And basically  I tried to string  them along  as quickly as I  could without  giving up too  much information  knowing how  you know  these type of  things work  but they took  it you know  hook line and  sinker  Really?  I really don't  have anything  else to add  this morning  I just wanted  to call in  and let you  know the army  struck and we  did really well  You certainly  did  Thank you  One more  Eric's from  Colorado  Eric  Hey guys  Wow Eric  How's Dylan?  I have no idea 
[01:01:00]  Alright  Anyway  I've been on  their show  about a year  ago I was  out visiting  some friends  in LA  and I spent  about an hour  in studio  watching their  show  and I mean  they do do  that show  live  but I will  say this  they've got  one of their  producers in  the background  that is just  the biggest  asshole  and the  biggest  prick  in the  world  and I  think that  that's where  the majority  of this came  from when this  guy started it  I'd love to  know and get  him on the  phone 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  I think that's  where it came  from  Hey speaking  of Howard  real quick  Howard doesn't  care so much  that that's why  he went on  on a tangent  when he got  kicked off the  air in Colorado  after Columbine  and the station  that he was on  out here  their ratings  went up  after he went  off the air  Howard doesn't  do as well  as he claims  he does  in a lot  of cities  so  Alright  thank you  Alright  Later  Bye  George from  Philly saying  Steve had a  sweet face  Ah 
[01:02:00]  sweet face  yes  sweet face  You do have a  sweet face  Why  Big Cherub  Big John  Panette face  you have  Oh  No it's not  that bad  It is  I want to shave  Panette is a  fucking coconut  he's huge  I want to shave  your facial hair  and put warm  oil all over  your face  and then slap  you until  you're hospitalized  Jesus  Alright  Steve has handed  in the audio  Anthony  So  This is from  last night  Playboy Radio 
[01:02:30]  This first clip  they apologize  without really  apologizing  Talk about  O&A  coming to LA  and night calls  to New York City  and maybe even  split  the talent up  Opie and Julie  and Tiffany  and Anthony  No wonder  they drag  O&A behind  trucks  What a doodle  I apologize  Bone dry  bone dry  I was slinging  lead  Slinging lead 
[01:03:00]  That's my favorite  We'll be back  with more of  The Greaseman Show  after I say  Negro  Oh  Sorry  I apologize  See I'm  Gallagher too  My impression  is not  as good  Gallagher too  Anthony's Gallagher  and I'm Gallagher too  It's my job  to smash the watermelon  Slinging lead  Slinging lead  See it's almost there  but it's like  but it's not  No because the voice  is off 
[01:03:30]  You have the right  cadence  I understand that  The Greaseman Show  The Greaseman Show  Water doodle  Bone dry  Snarling  Wow  Actually the only one  I could do  is  Slinging lead  I do that  with a lot  of his voices  I want to do  voices so bad  so  I'll mimic  Anthony doing  voices  Alright so  here's the first 
[01:04:00]  clip of them  apologize  I was going to ask  Wait wait  I had a question  Oh wait  but if you guys  do that switch  if one of you  goes to LA  and one of you  stays in New York  Where am I going to go  Are you guys going to  fight over me  Get the hint  No Opie  There's only two of them  That's all  Get the hint  Whoever didn't get  the sound clip  gets you  Huh  Whoever doesn't get  the mini me  sound clip  will get you  Oh I like that  The consolation  I already got  the mini me  sound clip  I mean if we split up  And why haven't you  played the mini me  sound clip yet 
[01:04:30]  He's using it  sparingly  I use it sparingly  I'm not a drill it  into the ground  kind of guy  I could just play that  for the sake of  playing it  but I'd rather play it  if there's a situation  that comes up  People want to hear  the mini me  sound clip  I know  that's what it is  You gotta hold  it back  Gotta hold back  a little bit  Still early  I know exactly  when to hit these things  And I was so obsessed  with you getting  the mini me  sound clip yesterday  that I found one  that I think is better  than your mini me  sound clip  There's no way  it's better  Oh yeah  I think it's better  Oh yeah I do 
[01:05:00]  I have a lot of confidence  in the one I found  I'm kind of hitting  on this one  for the early morning  You will be molested  I love that one  That's one of my  new favorites  Dr. Zachary Smith  from Lost in Space  saying that  You will be molested  Yeah it's really good  And I answer that  with this  God damn it  Are you fucking  with me  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  This is one of my  favorite Dr. Smith ones  This is actually  Dr. Smith  And dude  this is from  an episode  of Lost in Space 
[01:05:30]  No joke here  Listen to this  Holy ass  Are you  You will be molested  It is  It's Dr. Smith  Okay terrific  Exactly  You don't have  the okay terrific  I have it  You bubble headed  booby  And you got me too  He's got the mini me  clips  And you have me  I don't want you 
[01:06:00]  You do  No I don't want you  You do  Very fair trade  Now look what I do  I can't breathe  Stop  I love that one 
[01:06:30]  Oh dude  That is the funniest piece  of video I've ever seen  You've never seen that video  It's from Fox News  Honestly that could be  You know we were off the air  for about two years  That could be the funniest thing  since we were off the air  The video clip is hysterical  It's the typical  Fox News morning show  doing some dopey  segment on  wine making  So they got  one of their reporters  in one of those  big wooden barrels  with the grapes  stomping them  with their feet  and they're up  on a platform  and another woman 
[01:07:00]  I guess that works  at this winery  is next to her  in her own little  wooden bucket  Showing how it's done  And they're stomping  on the grapes  and talking  and a little stupid banter  They don't look funny  just stomping  Yeah  Just stomping  and talking  It's just one of those  hokey news segments  that they have to do  Yeah  All of a sudden  I guess the newswoman  was maybe attempting  to start to get out  of the barrel  and loses her balance  Falls out of it  Falls completely  off the platform  which is up about  six feet 
[01:07:30]  It's pretty high up  Right on her face  and her neck  and chest  Just  Wham!  Flat down  And it's live on TV  She lost her wind  obviously  Knocked the wind  right out of her  and these are the  sounds she made  right when she  hit the ground  And the anchors  or the people  that are back  in the studio  It turned into  what looked like  an SNL bit  with Will Ferrell  Yeah listen to what  they have to say  afterwards  Can I hear her clip  again?  Yeah no I got  the whole thing  with the long form  where they go back  in the studio  and the anchors  commenting on  what they just saw 
[01:08:00]  live  That's like the old  SNL bit  Oh dear 
[01:08:30]  Oh ouch  Oh  She let her  and Will Ferrell  Oh dear  She goes  Oh dear  Oh  That is  What a great sound  to come out  of a human  The first part  of the clip  if you get  it's faint  in the background  but it's that  Yeah the music  is still playing  Oh there she is  she can't breathe  feeling like  the Grim Reaper  is tapping  her shoulder  and there's  Yeah one more time  listen in the background  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  I can't 
[01:09:00]  Ow  Ow  Ow  Stop  Oh  Stop  Oh  I can't breathe  Stop  Stop  Do we have video of that?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh you gotta see it  It's great  Yeah Steve had the video clip  on foundrymusic.com  He is so sweet  He's a sweet face  We'll put it back up  on opianthony.com  Yes  So  Of course his face  is sweet  He's a big bear  and he's been getting  honey out of a tree trunk 
[01:09:30]  and eating it  so his face  is just covered with honey  He never seems to flinch  when there are bees around  No no  No he's used to it  Big bear  You know Ant  We should take a quick break  and then we'll get  to the Playboy audio  Alrighty  It's not really a tease  We don't have to tease  anymore on satellite radio  but I have to take a leak  and it's going to take  at least another 10 or 15 minutes  to get through this  Alrighty  The girls apologizing  and then a couple of our callers  getting through  to mess with them a bit  It's pretty funny stuff

No  If you're just tuning in  Listen to the replay  Because that was the set up  And then we went off  On a tangent  And then commercials  So basically the girls  From Playboy Radio  Talked about us  To begin their show yesterday  And they made it very obvious  They do not want to get into a battle  With you and I, Ant  No  So here's some audio  You know, we've been 
[01:17:30]  Working here on XM  For so long  And we know Opie and Anthony  But we've never got a chance  To work with them before  Yes  Getting to be on their show  And hang out with them  And they were so nice  And gracious to us  It was just great  To get to know them  And to talk about  And they'd be working with them again  They were cool  It was fun  I liked how  Well, what freaks me out  Is everyone  That's funny guys  Well, here's the thing  I mean, everyone kept saying  How did they treat you  Or are you nervous  And I mean, to be honest  I've never even heard their show  But I wasn't afraid at all  And I thought they were cool 
[01:18:00]  They were very nice  It's like when we do Man Cow  Everyone's like  Oh my God, he's so  You know, when I was on Howard  Everybody's like  Oh, watch out  He's going to get you  You know what?  I don't care  They've always been nice to us  It's called  They were both very funny  And quick  It's called  It's called your job  When you're like  Yeah  Those kind of jockeys  That doesn't mean  Honestly  That's not who you are  Exactly  It's kind of like  Me on Playboy TV  And radio  Yeah  And we're thinking about  Maybe  And at home 
[01:18:30]  We want to have them on our show  And work with them  In a couple ways  They said they were going to  Come down and hang with us  Yeah  In Porn Valley  I didn't know Gelman  Was producing their show  Yeah, I mean, I would love to see  Their show in LA  I think that they have  A bum rap  Being in a city  That doesn't have  The access to the stars  That we do  New York City  You know, I mean  We have an advantage  Living here  And having  The girls coming  Every day  Are you going to trade in places  For a week?  I don't think I can do  New York for a week  Tiffany  I've been banned  You know what?  You're just going to stay  In your room the whole time 
[01:19:00]  I'll just  I'll put up a cot  At the studio  And I'll just stay  In the studio  For the entire week  Hey, I've had an idea  Wouldn't it be funny  If for a week  Seriously  You turned on  Playboy Radio  And you got  Opie and Anthony  And you turned on  Opie and Anthony  And you got  Tiffany and Julie  That's interesting  It should be  Opie and Tiffany  Who are both redheads  Fine  It could be the  Firebush show  That's horrific 
[01:19:30]  Or something like that  I like that  Yeah  Fire  Of course he wouldn't  Be a bird  He'd be a fire stick  Yeah, can we go  Straight to Greg  He needs  He needs tips  For the bedroom  Oh my god  Leave the humor to us  And we'll leave  The dildo talk  To you guys  That's not funny  It's not a good idea  It's stupid  New York  She feels bad for  She's talking about  New York City  Like it's Kansas  Right  Well, you know  New York  They don't have access  To the stars 
[01:20:00]  Or anything  No, because no one  Ever comes through  New York City  Maybe she's just  Seen our guest list  Yeah, maybe  That's true  I'm not saying  We can get them  On the show  But we'd be  In the same boat  In LA  We still wouldn't  Get anybody  Who do we have  On the show today  A grown up Urkel  I mean  Get us some guests  Will you  Jesus  Who do we have  I don't even know  Al Franken  Al Franken's coming in  A legitimate guest  He's calling in  I think  A legitimate guest  He's a big guest  Al Franken 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  Al Franken  Really  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And Joe Rogan  Why is he big?  Joe Rogan is great  Al Franken  Was on  First of all  SNL  For almost the entire  You know  30 years  Whatever  I saw Joe Rogan  At the comedy store  When we were on hiatus  That guy is  Hiatus  Freaking  He does some  Really good stuff  On that stage  Man  He's great  The Fear Factor thing  Is kind of goofy  With him hanging out  With bartenders  And stuff  But his comedy  Is really  Really good  And really 
[01:21:00]  Really smart  Really smart  I never saw his stand up  It's really good  I haven't seen him  Do stand up  In 10 years  To be honest with you  Really?  And a huge supporter  Of our show  By the way  Yeah, he's great  Huge  I can't wait to talk to him  I didn't know  He was coming in today  He's not  He's calling in  Oh, calling in  Is he coming in  Or calling in  Calling in  Eric, let's get Ben in here  Alright, so that's  Ben would know  That's how the girls  Started their show  Last night  Or yesterday  Whenever they do their show  They backed down  Tremendously  Which is a very smart move  On their part  And justified  We didn't do anything to him  And you know what 
[01:21:30]  Just  I have to say this  Because we're pretty honest  On this show  Just listening to that producer  Ugh  Ugh  Ugh  Sounds like a Gilman wannabe  Right?  Yeah, a little bit  Well, it was like  I could see  It's not about you, stupid  Shut up  And let the girls talk  With their sexy voices  Shut up  Why didn't he just call  Ben or Steve  And go, look  If there's a problem  With this show  Why didn't he just call  And go, hey  What's going on?  We thought you had  A good time together  Why are you doing this?  And then it all  Would have been squashed  Before it ever hit the air  I still, you know 
[01:22:00]  I still have a bad taste  In my mouth for that  Yeah  I don't  I don't like that  No, I don't either  No  The guy there  He was spouting  All kinds of crap  About, for some reason  Us not acknowledging him  At the porn convention  In the 60 grand a year  That I spent on hookers  Allegedly I could do good with  Yeah  What am I going to do?  Send it to some tsunami  Charity  Yeah  So it winds up in Al-Qaeda's hands  Because apparently  That's what's going on  There you go  I put it back  Into the community  Do that  It goes right back 
[01:22:30]  Into the community  Here's my hard-earned dollars  Here you are, miss  Slash mister  Sometimes if there's a mistake made  Here you go  Alright, so then  Look at me with that sweet face  And accept my money  Look at this white creep  Look at that face  Michael Jackson  I hope he kills himself in jail  Look at him  If he goes to jail  No one has to worry about him  He is a disgrace  He could not survive in prison  Nah, they'd love him  They'd think he was railroaded  They'd all want to hang out with him  Ugh  Oh, by the way  Let me go to the phone really fast 
[01:23:00]  Alright, Ope  And then we'll go to the next  Playboy clip  But, Paul  Yes, Paul  Go ahead  Yeah, I was going to tell  No one  That guy Al Franken  He's such a left-wing  Liberal cocksucker  Is he really left-wing?  Extremely  But he's funny  What a dummy  Like I wouldn't know  Like anyone doesn't know that  Yeah, but dude  At least  I'll say this about Al Franken  He's really funny  I mean, I don't care  If he's liberal  As long as the guy is funny  That's all that matters  Yeah, but like  I just wish he stood out of politics  You know, these assholes  Against the politics 
[01:23:30]  And they all take the same route  Well, yeah  I mean, most political comics  Most political comics are liberal  More so than  You don't see many conservatives  I mean, you know  Nick DiPaolo and Leary  I mean, I'm sorry  Dennis Miller  But as long as you're funny  I don't care what your politics are  Alright, fair enough, man  Bye, sweetie  Alright  He wanted to know  All sorts of questions about us  Before he would come on our show  By the way  Yeah  And asking about our politics  And what we, you know  Well, that might have just been the agent  Sometimes the agents  Or the publicists  Overprotect them 
[01:24:00]  And they don't ask for it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And Air America  Is just bombing in New York City  By the way  Is it?  I thought they were doing well  Completely bombing  Why not?  No, good thing it's only New York City  And not, you know  Someplace big  It's not like this is a Republican state  Or anything  It's so Democratic  It's ridiculous  You would think Air America  Would do really well  In New York City  But anyway  So here's one of our  One of our Army members  Getting into the show  This is just  This is just silly fun  I guess  Let's take a listen  This was on Playboy Radio  Last night  Night Calls 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, can we go straight to Greg?  I want to go  He needs tips for the bedroom  We have a better sound  And you're the man  There's the first inside reference  Greg  Greg  So it's going to be something  About me, obviously  And here  Hey, Greg  Hey, girls  What's going on?  How are you?  I'm doing very well, actually  I've come across a problem  In the bedroom  And unfortunately  My girlfriend has  Fallen out of the loop  Of being sexual with me  And I'm trying to spice it up 
[01:25:00]  Okay  And I'd like to know some ideas  Because I heard your show yesterday  And you were  Making fun of  Anthony  Oh, they dumped out of our names there  They dumped out of that?  So  I guess that was one of those calls  That we're not going to  I guess  What?  Oh, you hear the producer?  He's just disgusted  Because they're getting pounded  So, you know  It sounded like a legitimate phone call  And then  He mentioned  That they had a problem 
[01:25:30]  With Opie and Anthony  But that was dumped out  And you hear part of Anthony  That's funny  I want to hear him go  And then you hear the guy we  I can honestly say  Will never like  Yeah  Piping in again  Yesterday  And you were  Making fun of  Anthony  Oh  So  I guess that was one of those calls  That we're not going to  I guess  Why don't we  That's terrific 
[01:26:00]  That's terrific  I get  He's just disgusted  Complete exasperation  Oh  I gotta hear that again  Oh my stars  That's great  Oh boy  Oh  So  I guess that was one of those calls  That we're not going to  I guess  Why don't we go to Bernie  Oh  That's fantastic 
[01:26:30]  Terrific  You can tell  That's terrific  You can tell that guy's just an ass  Yeah  You can just tell  Oh yeah  So then the next call  Well we'll hear that part again  And then we'll let it roll  Then I guess they go into Bernie  As in Bernie gets  Oh  So  I guess that was one of those calls  That we're not going to  I guess  Why don't we go to Bernie really quick  I like the way that they try to  Disguise their bullshit  With a question  Hey Bernie  Hi guys  Hi Bernie  I've been a big fan of you guys 
[01:27:00]  For a long time  Julie and Tiffany  Great show  Thanks  Well anyway  I have a question  I was wondering if you can answer my question  It basically has to do with  My girlfriend and a menage a trois  And I'm trying to get her interested  Okay  And the question is  That I'd like to have my little friend Chester  Join us  But I'm not sure she likes little doggies  And I don't think that she likes  You're a fucking sicko Bernie 
[01:27:30]  Shame on you  You know see this is what I like  Is that all of a sudden  These are the kind of callers  That do call that show  And no we don't like little doggies  Little Chester  Oh that is good  You assholes  Pests again  Our listeners are pests  Just pestering the other show  I heard that on line last night  I really got a nice chuckle out of it  That is funny  See that's what I mean by inside jokes 
[01:28:00]  There's a lot of new listeners  Just tuning in XM today  And they're not in on that gag unfortunately  You Chester the dog you kicked  What?  But at this point  They don't go back to the phones  For an hour Anthony  For an hour  They continue to talk  With their in studio guest  Plugging a sex book  And then  What is this a Playboy regular?  Yeah  Alright then  I don't even know  What we're about to listen to  Let's take a  Take a peek  Wait Rusty  Rusty's got a question for Bart  I want to get you a question  Hey Rusty  Hey how's it going?  How are you baby? 
[01:28:30]  Well I got a message from Ace  Saying you need callers  So here I am  Imagine that  Thanks baby  Right on  Yeah alright  I get what they put together for us  What happened was  Because our guys were getting through like crazy  And they were screening the calls  Yeah  They didn't take any phone calls for a long time  And that's what the whole show was about  Uh huh  So then this is a regular that called  And going hey I'm here  You know I know you need calls  Oh there you go  And then the show was  And then I guess they just got like show regulars on the phone  To complete their show 
[01:29:00]  They took maybe a few more phone calls  And then just  It was the next two hours  Just banter between them  Until they went off the air  I noticed there was a lot of talk with the guests  Which you're going to talk to the guests  But I noticed there was a lot more than a normal call-in show  Yeah  I think  Oh that's a shame  Well  That would have been funny  If a lot more of our listeners could have gotten through  Yeah  Well  It was still funny  Because I would have liked to have heard from a little Connor Peterson  Oh yeah  Connor  Connor  Scott  From Modesto  Scott  Jimmy Robinson would have been nice  Yeah maybe  Scott from Modesto with a little motorboat question 
[01:29:30]  Maybe somebody in his uh  You know Helen  You know  Who knows  All that stuff  Helen and Jimmy Robinson could have called it  Aww  That would have been some really good laughs  Yeah  Yeah no  That would have been some funny stuff  Alright well  Gene could have called and talked about his fetish  Of throwing a young boy down the stairs  And then coddling him  And then not taking pictures with him  Someone posted that on the message board  First he throws him down the steps  And then he won't take a picture with him  Alright well 
[01:30:00]  Good job by the ONA Army  Yes  Bravo  Very good  They have backed way down  As well as they should  And I think we could all be friends again  Yeah  Right  Except for the guy in there  Yeah  The girl's fine  You know  They're chicks  What are you gonna do  And they're really hot  Yeah  They are hot  They're very hot  But the guy there  He just sounds like an ass  He sounds like a dork  There's no part of him  So uh  They didn't like me very much  I don't think  So we're gonna call off the Army  At this point Anthony  It's over  Yeah for now 
[01:30:30]  It's over and done  It was a nice quick little attack  For now  Just to show who's uh  Who's  Who's boss  Mmhmm  So we're done with that  We do now  The only place that the Army is still called  Will be this weekend in Chicago  With Vernon Hills Zanies  Oh  Yes  Ugh  You're playing at a Zanies  It's a good club actually  In Vernon Hills, Illinois  Is it?  Yeah  I mean Zany  Well no  It's Z-A-N-I-E-S  As opposed to Zany  Is it gonna be Zany  Oh  In Chicago  Zany 
[01:31:00]  If I walk on music  That's more wacky than wacky  Proving that comedy club owners  Just don't have a funny bone  Not there  That's another comedy club  Chained funny bone  I know  I know  Hit me right in it  Alright  Ben's in the studio  I'll say he is  Perky, jerky, crazy-haired dick  Producer of the show  He does his best to know the rest  Dude, he's insane  Tom Brady was going low  There's a feeling deep inside  Bad sushi made him sick  Just call him old  Cravy Lake  That fucking crazy-haired dick  Glad the gossip stars 
[01:31:30]  Oh  His mule's so big and round  Backing like a maniac  Ben Sparks  Wow  You can just picture him  Herky in and jerky  No, I'm sorry  I meant to play this one  I like this one  The rap one, right?  It's Ben  The Bear Steve  That's the one I meant to play  Sorry 
[01:32:00]  What about the rap song  That's really good  I don't have it on my little machine  Why, Opie?  I don't know  Maybe Eric will put it on later today  So  What did Al Franken's people say?  Oh, they wanted to know  What your political views were  So Anthony told me to write  Bedwetting liberals  Yeah  I put  I said  Just say we're bedwetting liberals  So there you go  That's it  They think we'll be one big happy family  Why does that matter, man?  It's like  I think it's more the  Maybe it's not coming from him  I think it's  I think it's more the agent  To be honest with you  Yeah  Like Jim said on the air  A few minutes ago 
[01:32:30]  I think it's more his people  So then if we said  We were like  Hardcore conservative  They wouldn't book him?  I don't know  I mean  Or they'd give him a warning  And say  Watch it  That's going to be confrontational  Well, if you're a guy like Al Franken  Where you kind of  If you just sandbag a guy  For his political views  But a guy like Franken  Makes his living  Being, look  These are my political views  That's part of who he is  Yeah  Publicly  You know, if a rock star calls in  And you attack him  That's different  Yeah  But these guys  Got to be prepared for this stuff  Conservatives deal with it all the time  Sean Hannity  Always gets liberals on his show 
[01:33:00]  Yeah  He always wants to go after liberals  And it's like  The left doesn't seem to want to do that  No, no  Well  Oh, the plane video  There it is  Watch  Oh, yeah  He hit a wire  He was trying to land on that street  Yeah  He was trying to land on the golf course  That's what you think  Because he  That's why it looked like  He was going for the street  That's what the  Well, they were saying on the news  He was trying to land on the golf course  And that was the green  Maybe  Maybe that's where  He was going too fast  To land on that golf course  Why was he so  I guess he had an engine problem  That's why he was there  Yeah  That's some crazy video  Wow  This morning, huh  Did you see the van right next to him? 
[01:33:30]  Oof  You imagine seeing that out your window?  Like, holy ass  So, alright  What time's Al coming  Uh, calling  845, nine-ish  Alright, very good  As we go to break  We got the  How's your news clip, Anthony  Oh, the Al Franken one  Yeah, where the guy  He's retarded or slow  I don't know what the hell  Very retarded  He really can't talk  And he pretty much  Sandbags Al Franken  At one of these conventions  Al Franken  I don't  I think Al Franken  Didn't really know  How to handle it  Very uncomfortable 
[01:34:00]  Very uncomfortable  Check this out  You know, I didn't understand that  I'm sorry  We got the pool  Also  Pretty much  And how are you  Are you having a good time?  Oh yeah  Who have you talked to so far?  Bullion  Bullion 
[01:34:30]  Maya  you know I couldn't agree more yeah it was really nice talking to you I'm glad  you're here I think it's fabulous  can I shake your hand yeah thanks a lot thank you very much 
[01:35:00]  yeah okay have a good time it is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze squeeze the  breasts no shit it's real real soft almost like pudding almost like pudding yes a hard piece of  ass quite a handful yeah the nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger  and some will give a perfectly good result we all be an employee show in case you don't  nudge I like I like this crowd too because I get away from Hollywood everybody everybody in 
[01:35:30]  Hollywood they're so show busy everybody's in showbiz is everybody you meet the people at  drugstore grocery store waiters waitresses they're all frustrated screenwriters directors actors  even a policeman stopped me for drunk driving he's a frustrated choreographer said he walked  the line he wants me to follow after him all right here we go  and follow to me step kick will change the person step step step step kick will change the person  step step and smile pretty shuffle off the puff and now pretty fingers so I miss the step bitch  don't get me pithy I am in a mood 
[01:36:00]  skydiving was definitely the scariest thing I've ever done  let me ask you this question in regards to the skydiving  what is the point of the helmet in the skydiving I mean can you kind of make it  you jump out of that plane that chute doesn't open the helmet is now wearing you for protection 
[01:36:30]  later on the helmet's talking with the other helmets going it's a good thing he was there or I would  have hit the ground directly there are many things that we could point to as proof that the human being  is not smart the helmet is my personal favorite the fact that we had to invent the helmet now why did we  invent the helmet well because we were participating in many activities that were cracking our heads we  looked at the situation we chose not to avoid these activities but to just make little plastic hats 
[01:37:00]  so that we can continue our head cracking lifestyles the only thing dumber than the helmet is the helmet law  the point of which is to protect the brain that is functioning so poorly it's not even trying to stop the cracking of the head that it's in  at least the helmet is functional clothing I appreciate that  Anthony XM 202 
[01:37:30]  word up everybody say  when you hear the call you got to get it out of the way  word up it's a cold word  no matter what you say it you know that's all they learn  all right what do you guys want to do next got a bunch of stuff to get to  hmm we got the uh lost in space clips yeah we've been obsessed with this for many years young boys 
[01:38:00]  we actually had uh what's his name jonathan harris yeah jonathan harris  we had him on our show back in uh back at any w remember that i sure did another one that over the two years that we were off uh dropped dead  dr zachary smith from lost in space we for for years god from the time we hooked up uh to do radio 
[01:38:30]  we've been goofing on the fact that he uh really comes off like a pedophile on lost in space with young william  there you had uh penny uh who was the the sister and then judy who was like the big blonde on the show  big torpedo tits she had on her a hot piece of ass  major west though is was uh i think having sex with her  but dr smith never gave them a look  young penny and judy nothing 
[01:39:00]  uh barely talked to the adults the adults would have nothing to do with him because he was just a screw up  he would always try to sabotage things and he was always wrecking the no one ever had a conversation with dr smith  it was just him talking with the young boy  young william  constantly going out on little outings  you know everybody else they'd land on some planet  and the rest of the crew  you know the father there  and and uh don westner 
[01:39:30]  would go out and do whatever they had to do  they would work  collect food for the family  the ladies  work on the spaceship a little bit  yeah the ladies would set up the hydroponic garden  and start getting some uh food together for them  the guys would repair the ship  or go out and see if they could find some kind of supplies  that they need  and dr smith what was he doing  just roaming around  a box with will  looking around  william come with me 
[01:40:00]  looking for monsters  looking for monsters  oh dear  hoping that the rain would come  little game of monster rain under the jupiter 2  yes  incidentally that is where jimmy robinson's last name came from  right  because you thought william robinson was pretty cool  cool yeah  because he hung out with an old man  i don't remember  this whole thing is getting deeper  i didn't know that  young jimmy norton come with me  oh dear 
[01:40:30]  oh dear  come with me jimmy norton  and uh for some reason the family had no problem with this  sending will off with dr smith  who pretty much almost got the entire family killed  on a weekly basis  but uh i guess all was forgiven by the end of the episode  you play the music  do do do do do do do do  come on smith  back in the ship smith  instead of leaving him out there you know 
[01:41:00]  hogtied  and invite him back in  so they can land on another planet  and he can romp around with uh  with their young son again  um we're we're slowly but surely going through all the clips of the show  yeah  how many years is it on  uh those are the shows back in the 60s  were only on  just a couple seasons  yeah  it just seems like they were on forever  well not that long  but they pumped out a lot of episodes back then too  so uh  this is  we got like ten really quick uh clips here  mhm 
[01:41:30]  the first one is just over  overacting  yeah it's just the way uh  he ran around like a  like a faggot  and it's weird though  if you watch the first couple of episodes of lost in space  lost in space  it's uh the mood is a lot darker  and uh  it's not as camp and zany  you know  and dr smith isn't this  over the top  kansas city faggot  that he turns into  by the later part of the show  he's very evil  very dark and sinister  and he was there to sabotage the jupiter too

We like to call it the O.N.A. virus because it's spreading across America slowly but surely.  Thanks for your help with that, by the way.  You do so much for this radio show.  Hey, is this true?  That a henchman from Brooklyn is saying you brought up Scotty Schwartz doing porno.  What you failed to mention was that his first scene was, in fact, Julie Ashton, 
[02:05:30]  your friend from the Playboy Channel show.  Oh, really?  Interesting.  We'll have to ask her next time she's on our program.  Yeah.  Anthony, people are also suggesting that we do Dr. Smith versus, not versus,  but we play the Dr. Smith clip with the mini-me clip and see how it sounds.  See how it sounds?  Well, we could try that.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  That's kind of funny.  All right.  Good pick up, whoever suggested that.  Very good.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow 
[02:06:30]  And no, T-Bones, I didn't do my homework assignment.  I was supposed to watch The Cooler, remember?  Yeah, it's a good movie.  Why would I start doing something I never, ever did in my life?  Homework.  Speaking of movies, my darling, my blood.  I have not a clue. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you.  I don't know.  Anthony, I want to wish Howard a very happy birthday.  I believe he's 55, or close to 55 anyway.  Wow.  Definitely closer to 60 than 40.  Right.  And I guess he continues to not care.  I don't care.  He continues to not care.  On a daily basis, he's not caring. 
[02:07:30]  He doesn't care so much that I think he's caring.  He's not caring so much that he's answering this program with his I don't cares.  Right.  Which is pretty goddamn funny.  Well, we know he has XM Satellite Radio because the company, I don't know if they really showed  interest in him.  They listened to him and decided to pass on him, and that's why he went to the little  doggy company because XM Satellite Radio is not stupid, you know?  You watch Sirius go bankrupt because of the deal they made with Howard.  He drives around in that Escalade, which is a GM product, and it's got XM in it. 
[02:08:00]  Right.  It's got XM Standard.  So, trust me, he hears us on a daily basis.  Yeah.  Any financial guy will tell you it's a horrendous deal for the little doggy company.  Bark, bark.  That's the reality.  And with him turning, I think, 55 today, by the time he gets to Satellite Radio, I mean,  the guy is pretty much pushing 60.  Yeah.  You know, you're not getting the young, youthful Howie.  Not from the old days.  You're getting the, I don't know, the Willie Mays Howie when Willie Mays joined the Mets. 
[02:08:30]  Not the same Willie Mays.  No.  You know?  That's wrong.  You're getting Joe Montana when he...  Went to Kansas City.  Thank you.  Went to Kansas City.  Ooh.  You're getting kind of Michael Jordan when he went to the Wizards.  Not good.  Not as good, right?  Randy Johnson when he went to the Yankees.  Poor Kevin Brown when he went to the Yankees.  Poor Dave Winfield when he went to the Yankees.  George likes the older talent.  Yeah, he really does. 
[02:09:00]  He likes the proven talent.  I understand Rizzuto is playing shortstop that shit.  Holy cow.  All right.  So I guess we have the latest clip of Howie Not Caring, Anthony.  There is a latest clip.  That's the funniest part.  He just doesn't care.  He doesn't care so much that he's got to rant every day.  Every day.  About how he doesn't care.  How much he doesn't care.  Well, it takes up show time.  It certainly does.  You know, you could not care for 20 minutes or you could actually do entertaining, clever, 
[02:09:30]  funny programming.  What would you choose?  I'd rather not care.  I'd rather talk about not caring for 20 minutes.  I don't care.  So this is what we do now.  A little mix.  Because you've got to play the song with the latest I Don't Care, right?  Right.  All right.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  Who cares?  I don't care anymore about them dicking with me.  You know, I'm talking about from my point of view, I really don't give a rat's ass.  I'm going off to do my thing. 
[02:10:00]  You know, I'm going off to do my thing.  You keep doing what you're doing, Howard.  Who cares?  I don't care anymore about them dicking with me because you can't really do anything to me.  I mean, what are you going to do, pull me off the air?  You're just bumming out the fans.  I mean, do what you want.  I don't care.  Who cares?  And I know I keep saying I don't care, so that must mean I care.  Yeah, you care, Howard.  You definitely care.  I don't care.  Who cares?  And I know I keep saying I don't care, so that must mean I care. 
[02:10:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  Who cares?  All right.  Hey, anyway, thanks.  I don't care.  That is great.  Oh, that is a direct answer.  I know I keep saying I don't care, so that means I care.  But I don't care.  How he's answering us with this?  I don't care.  That's hysterical.  Oh, my God, he's crazy.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  He's not going to stop. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, this is stupid.  You're not doing comedy.  You're aggravating people.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  All right, there's the latest I don't care.  He just doesn't care.  He actually said, I know if I say I don't care, it means I must care, but I don't care.  He's losing his mind.  That is really funny. 
[02:11:30]  You should get a room next to cabbies at the insane asylum.  Oh, my goodness.  So there you go.  There's the latest on that.  Oh, happy birthday to you.  I don't care.  Happy birthday to you.  I don't care.  How old are you now?  I don't care.  I think that now that he's pushing 60, it's starting to get to him a little bit.  A little bit.  All right.  Well, the Pope's checking in, Anthony. 
[02:12:00]  Yes, Pope.  Pope.  Yes, good morning, gentlemen.  I just wanted to call in to let you know that being the Pope, I don't care about gays.  You don't care?  I don't care.  Oh.  All right.  Well.  I've got too much to do.  All right.  Well, that didn't really.  You're trying to be a wacky character?  Yeah, that really didn't work.  I'm really sorry to the listeners there.  Jim the Trucker, what's up, Jim?  The wrong template on you.  Yeah, you guys need to use the stifler from American Wedding saying, I don't care, when  he's talking to the dancer. 
[02:12:30]  I just don't care.  Just dance.  I don't care.  We're obsessed with I don't care now.  I want every song that mentions it.  I know Phil Collins had a song called I Don't Care Anymore.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We played the Ramones yesterday, I Don't Care.  It's all about I don't care.  That would be a good one.  Which one?  Phil Collins.  I Don't Care Anymore?  Yeah.  But then we'd sound faggy.  Well, we'd have to say why we're playing it.  Just a piece.  But I don't care if you say we're faggy.  I don't care.  We're doing it for the show. 
[02:13:00]  Why would I care?  Lee from Philly.  What's up, Lee?  Lee?  Hello?  Lee?  Yeah.  Speak.  Jesus, Lee.  Pretty relaxed today.  They amputated my leg.  What?  They amputated my leg.  Oh, yeah?  I got to ask you a favor.  Anything.  See, I'm the only one that knows what Lee is referring to.  I got you.  Okay.  All right.  I don't know, but now I know what I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you, Lee.  And I don't care.  Thank you.  I forgot.  Yes.  Yes, the leg was amputated.  I forgot about that part.  Yes.  Very good, Lee.  Lee?  He's talking my language today.  What?  Huh?  I don't...  You don't get it?  No.  We just don't know.  We haven't seen it.  Ah, Lady Di.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Oh.  I don't care either.  Obviously.  Oh, she's trying to get in on it.  I don't care either.  Can I be one of you? 
[02:14:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Shut up.  Why not?  Stupid.  Hey.  The only time you should say I don't care is if someone asks how your liver is doing.  My liver is okay.  It's not.  Everything is okay with that.  Yeah.  Here's Lady Di laying in a corner of her apartment last night.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did you hear what she was saying during that clip? 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no, no.  That's not true.  That's not true.  That is not true.  She's got a battle.  Really, Lady Di?  Really?  Do you understand comedy at all?  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  It's like I'm listening to your show, ain't I?  I thought you didn't have XM, dude.  Yes, and how are you listening to the show?  When you get put on hold, you can listen to your show.  When you get put on hold.  I guarantee there's someone in a coma that's also listening to this show right now because  the family thinks it's the right thing to do, all right? 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no, no.  Just because you listen to this show doesn't mean you get comedy.  I know what comedy is.  All right, what's comedy?  What's your definition of comedy?  Something that makes you laugh.  All right.  So you falling down the steps is comedy.  That would be.  I don't know about that.  Love the clip of you falling out of that grape stomping bin onto your face.  I don't think so.  I don't think so. 
[02:15:30]  No.  Now, my definition of comedy is when you watch something funny that's on television or you  listen to a funny show on the radio.  That's the definition?  Yeah.  That's the definition.  Mm-hmm.  That's very specific.  That's the definition of comedy.  That's what it is.  What's the definition of unfit mother?  Excuse me?  I said, what's the definition of unfit?  I'm a very fit mom.  I didn't say that.  I said, what's the definition of unfit mother?  Definition of an unfit mother?  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  A mother that doesn't care about her kids?  Uh-huh.  What's that?  No, unfit.  He didn't say uncaring.  He said unfit.  Oh, come on.  What is the definition of unfit mother?  I just told you that.  No, you could be caring.  You could love the child and still not be fit to care for it.  To provide for it.  So, what's the definition of unfit mother?  No, no, no.  I have no idea what the definition is.  What's the definition of an alcoholic?  A person that drinks a lot.  No.  How much is a lot? 
[02:16:30]  And actually, that's not true.  You're right.  That's not true.  A person that drinks a lot.  How much is a lot?  How much is a lot?  Yeah, that's it.  Answer the question with the same question.  Okay, uh, you know, one, one is, oh God, I can't, I don't know, I heard this one time  before.  One is, you know, too many.  Are you trying to say one's too many and a thousand's not enough?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's not the definition.  That's a quick, catchy phrase, but that's not the definition.  How much is too much? 
[02:17:00]  What Jim just, what Jim just told you.  No, I'm not asking, Jim, and that is not the definition.  What is your definition, you fat slob?  Hey, excuse me, who said that, Opie?  What do you think?  And I ask who agreed with it, and you can say everyone in the country.  No, you know, 10 or 20 is too many.  10 or 20?  A day?  Yeah, that's the attitude of a social drinker. 
[02:17:30]  And how many drinks do you have a day?  I really, I don't know.  Yes, you do.  You don't know.  I don't know.  I can't answer that.  So you're saying you think it's socially acceptable?  What am I going to do subject for?  Hey, so you think it's socially acceptable to sit down for a fine dinner and have nine tequilas?  No.  Well, you said 10 to 20.  10 to 20.  Definitely not.  All right, what's the update?  It's not acceptable.  Do you have a job?  You find a stupid job. 
[02:18:00]  I'm going for a job interview today, as a matter of fact.  As what?  As a waitress.  Hostess.  Ugh.  What's so bad about that?  I don't know.  What kind of place are you going to make people feel comfortable eating in?  Are you leading them to troughs in a barn?  No.  It's a place that's a few blocks away from me.  They call me back.  Does the meal include watching jousting?  No.  I can see you being a hostess there. 
[02:18:30]  That's about it.  What's that?  With that laugh.  That covering up the tears laugh.  What would you have to wear at this job?  Um, probably a white shirt and black pants.  Ugh.  You know that's going to make you look even fatter, right?  No.  White shirt, black pants is going to make you look even fatter.  More like Oliver Hardy.  Well, that's what you have to wear.  In black and white.  Would you like me to seat you now? 
[02:19:00]  We have a lovely coconut custard pie today.  Would you like some?  See you bringing people.  Here is your menu.  Please read it and I'll be back to you shortly.  Mmm.  Oh, with a silly mustache.  Yeah, should I wear it?  What?  Should I wear my mustache or not? 
[02:19:30]  Thank you for the gratuity.  Oh my God.  Maybe I should wear my mustache and my tie.  What do you think?  Are you drunk?  No, I'm not.  Hold on.  Still got your roommate right now.  Still got your roommate in there?  No, my roommate is coming back today.  He went down to shore for about a week.  All right, listen.  Some guy named Ernie? 
[02:20:00]  Oh no, it's spelled Ernie?  Hendry?  Hendry?  Hey, Hendry.  Yes.  Is it?  Wait.  Ernie spelled E-N-R-I.  Oh wait, they might have misspelled this name.  What's your name, sir?  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Shut up, Diane.  Listen, why do you keep calling this show?  Why?  Who, who, who are you talking to me?  You stupid, what is your name, huh?  It's Diane. 
[02:20:30]  Why do you keep calling this fucking show?  Why?  Why do I keep calling this show?  Yes, stupid.  And don't answer a question with a question, you fucking retard.  If I ask you a question, answer it directly.  Okay.  Why do you keep calling this show?  You fucking disastrous mess.  Good.  Why?  Thank you.  Why?  No, I'm not a disaster.  And where are you going to work?  What kind of restaurant would give you tips?  Tips to stay the fuck away, maybe?  I think you would have people tipping you to walk the other way. 
[02:21:00]  You know, you sound like a Frenchie, you know that?  Oh, my God, you stupid fucking cunt.  Someone get this idiot in XM radio so you understand what the fucking show is about.  You mess.  Excuse me?  Are you going to come into work smelling like Budweiser and Jack Daniels, you friggin' slob?  No, I'm going to go to work smelling nice.  Okay, smelling nice, I see.  Why do you keep calling this show?  You understand?  Because I like the guys.  You like the guys?  Do you think they like you?  Do you hear how they talk to you?  I like them, okay? 
[02:21:30]  I asked you a question.  Stupid, do you think they like you?  You keep calling and all, you get a shit on and then you laugh like an idiot, like a cackling idiot.  Are you Frenchie's brother?  No, stupid.  Don't ask me if I'm Frenchie's brother, that fucking prick.  Anyway, hey, stupid, good luck on your stupid job interview, okay?  Well, I'm going to go for my job interview, yeah.  Go drink about what?  What?  Social drinker, 20 buds, and then go for the interview.  How do you know how much I drink?  I'm done with you.  Punch is out. 
[02:22:00]  He knows where the punch is.  Yeah, that's why we like him.  He sounds like Frenchie's brother.  What?  He sounds like Frenchie's brother.  What do you mean?  Frenchie sounds the same thing.  Frenchie was the same way.  What?  Frenchie is the same way.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, you were kind of making a joke.  I'm not making a joke.  I'm just saying.  You know, you have the humor value of a bat to a pregnant woman's stomach.  Well, I don't.  Okay, Jim.  Thank you.  The definition of comedy, not you. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  Well, I didn't say anything.  Everybody.  Everybody.  All right.  There she goes, everybody.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Everybody.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Oh, my God.  What a complete disaster. 
[02:23:00]  Physically, mentally.  Emotionally.  Yeah.  Just a mess.  Bankrupt.  She's still looking for a job.  Still.  I got an interview today.  Oh, come on.  Let me watch the Richard Gere clip, please, and just have a few laps.  What are you talking about?  Richard Gere, where he's dancing.  I don't know what it is.  Oh, what a great movie that is.  Yeah, that looks really good.  What's the movie about?  Oh, him and Susan Sarandon is in it.  Yeah.  And he's.  J-Lo. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, right.  And he's going out at night.  And, you know, I guess his wife thinks he's maybe cheating.  Right.  But the truth of the matter is, he's just learning how to dance.  Because I'll bet his wife wants him to dance.  Right.  And then he goes to a pet store to get her something.  And he sits down and a gerbil slips in.  And that's how he shakes his pelvis.  He learns how to really dance.  Because there's a gerbil up his colon.  And then he remembers that he hasn't done anything interesting since internal affairs.  Right.  When he's telling the other Andy Garcia that he's going to teach his wife how to come by fucking her in the ass. 
[02:24:00]  Exactly.  That was a great scene.  Oh, and then he finds out his wife's pregnant and buys a boat.  Moves to Modesto.  It's fantastic.  It's a great movie.  And then while she's spinning in her dance, he smashes a hammer into her face.  And looks at Amber Frye's naked pictures.  Oh.  And they have that little daughter that's in the beauty contest and he chokes her in the basement.  He leaves a little lifeless cowboy-hatted body.  Oof. 
[02:24:30]  Oof.  The little hollow clink with a hat hitting the floor.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  A little plunk of a hard felt cowboy hat.  That is wonderful.  Yeah, sure.  A little two-gallon hat.  Two-gallon.  Oh, the little boots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Giddy up.  Little boots.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  I bought a gerbil at the petting zoo. 
[02:25:00]  If Richard Gere can do it, I can too.  I get undressed.  I start to lube.  I stick the gerbil in the end of the tube.  Wondering just how he'll feel.  Will he like it better than his little wheel?  Careful now, he's right beside me.  One more inch and he's inside me.  Go, gerbil, go. 
[02:25:30]  Burrow harder, burrow deeper.  Be my little chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot about.  How am I supposed to get you out? 
[02:26:00]  So now my gerbil's on easy street.  It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat.  The situation is beyond my control.  Got to find a way to get him out of his hole.  I try crowbars.  I try wires.  I almost hurt him with a pair of pliers.  I try cheese, but he's not biting.  I wish this wasn't so exciting. 
[02:26:30]  Go, gerbil, go.  Jesus, I am such a sucker.  Please get out, you furry.  I think I am getting ill.  Suddenly, he's very, very still.  Now it's too late. 
[02:27:00]  My gerbil died.  I guess I have committed gerbicide.  Here's some advice.  It's very clear cut.  If you love your gerbil,  don't stick him up your butt.  They'll stick him up your butt.  Little fairy gerbil in your booty hole. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Wow.  The gerbil song.  It's time, it's time, it's time to find, to find, to find, to find America's sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy.  Let's hear it for Pennsylvania.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, so wet.  Oh.  This is hard, baby.  Harder.  Oh.  Oh, it's slipping me over.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, grab my ass.  Grab my ass.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Think you can do better?  Call Opie and Anthony live at 866-WOW-1-WOW and give it your best shot. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, oh, I'm going to stick it in my ass.  Whoa.  Hey, that's something you don't hear every day.  Hey, he shoots.  That's his.  Pac-10 basketball.  It's the Pac-10 today.  Watch the balls, man.  Watch the balls.  Hey, switch, switch, switch.  Get in his leg.  Get in his leg.  It's the Pac-10 today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Wednesday, January the 12th, 2005.  I'm Ari Bikowski with your Pac-10 today. 
[02:29:00]  Arizona will host the SoCal contingent beginning with USC on Thursday evening and then hosting  UCLA on Saturday.  Wildcat head coach Lou Dolson looks ahead to Saturday's contest against UCLA and talks  about the program of UCLA in 2005.  It's still a school with a lot of national recognition, even though you have to look back  a ways to find when UCLA was a champ of this league.  It seems like it's, you know, it's been ourselves or Sanford or Oregon, so I don't know how far 
[02:29:30]  you go back, maybe even 97 or 95, I don't know, but you'll have to look at that.  But it's different now than it was.  Now let's stay in the state of Arizona in the Pac-10, so of course we're talking about  Arizona State, and head coach Rob Evans talks about injuries and trying to find depth on  his bench the early season.  I don't think we've had a lot of injuries.  I think we've had a few injuries.  You know, hopefully, you know, we can stay pretty healthy. 
[02:30:00]  What we've tried to do, you know, we can't afford to lose Ike, but what we've tried to  do, we've tried to, with our schedule, try to play a lot of guys a lot of minutes, so  that if we do have some minor injuries, that we have some sickness or something, we've got  guys that have been in the game so that they're ready to go.  Pac-10 hoops starting to really heat up.  No team is without a loss in the conference.  It seems that this year there's a lot of parity, so expect some games, possibly give you a coronary,  or may be responsible for your high blood pressure. 
[02:30:30]  And that's the Pac-10 today on XM Satellite Radio.  So we have Al Franken calling in, in a little bit. 
[02:31:00]  Yep, allegedly.  That'll be cool.  Got a lot of instant feedbacks that came in.  Matt from Marlboro, New Jersey.  The only way Lady Di is going to get tipped as a waitress is if she puts on a cow suit  and falls asleep standing up.  That's a good one.  A bus full of retarded children crashing into a ravine.  Bigger laughs than Lady Di.  Maybe she could work at TGI Fridays. 
[02:31:30]  She could fit 5,000 pieces of flair on that torso.  I would suggest Di getting a job in Indonesia, but they already have enough bloated corpses there.  Although if she worked at TGI Fridays, the TGIF would stand for thank God I'm fat.  Old Jimmy Pee-Pee's hole.  Checking in from Cincinnati.  If you listen carefully to her, she says about her interview,  if they call me today.  They're not going to call you. 
[02:32:00]  She didn't have an effing interview is what the dude from Cincinnati is saying.  You mean she was lying?  I believe so.  Not Lady Di.  She never lies.  You know what she looks like with her awful fat front and flat ass?  Shut up.  You look like a ham in a deli that's been through the deli slicer where the one side is really flat  and the other is bulbous and fat and unattractive.  You should have saran wrap over you.  Will you be nice?  I am being nice.  Well, be nicer. 
[02:32:30]  I'm insulting hams.  You're insulting hams.  That's it.  Repeat it.  I bomb and you think you're going to pull it out?  Stupid.  You never know.  So you're waiting for them to call you today or do you have an actual interview?  I have an actual interview at 1 o'clock.  Where is it?  It's at a steakhouse.  What town?  It's a 2 o'clock away from me.  What town?  Garwood, New Jersey.  Question.  Garwood, New Jersey?  Garwood, New Jersey. 
[02:33:00]  All right, Lady Di, listen to me.  I live in Westfield.  Lady Di, listen to me.  What?  Stop calling the program unless you have something.  You have nothing.  You absolutely have nothing except your alcoholism.  What do you mean I don't have anything?  I'm telling you that I'm going for a job interview today.  You're lying.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  What?  We'll give you one more shot.  You have called a radio show.  You did not call your friends.  We're not your friends.  I, quite frankly, hate you.  You don't hate me.  I certainly do.  No, you don't.  I certainly do.  No, you don't hate me. 
[02:33:30]  I just don't care.  Because you can't take care of yourself.  You can't take care of your own son.  You probably want people to feel sorry for you.  I just don't like you.  Okay?  Listen to me.  You're calling a radio show.  What do you mean I don't take care of my son?  Of course I take care of him.  You're calling a radio show.  You're not calling your stupid friend, Marion, or probably that's about it.  She's not stupid.  Oh, yes, she is.  I've got to be stupid.  Now, listen to me.  She's not stupid.  You're not calling your friends or your family.  You're calling a talk radio program. 
[02:34:00]  No kidding.  That's the reality of this, okay?  We're doing a national radio show.  I know.  So when you call, you need to have something for the show.  Well, okay.  I heard you talking about Jonathan Harris before Lost in Space.  I used to watch that show.  Okay, we've got something on Lost in Space.  All right.  All right.  Go right ahead.  We've got something on Lost in Space.  Lady Di, let her rip.  Okay, I used to watch that show.  And I remember the robot.  I remember Jonathan Harris.  I remember Zachary Smith. 
[02:34:30]  Okay, and I remember young William.  I know about that stuff.  You're an ass of epic proportions.  You really are.  How are you?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You remember things.  Unfortunately, what you don't remember is the uncle that snuck in and sent you on this downward spiral when you were four.  My uncles live in Italy.  Why can't there be, like, a big mountain right behind your house and a lot of rainfall?  Exactly. 
[02:35:00]  Were you tap dancing on a mountain ledge recently?  No.  This proves there's no God.  People like you continue to exist and fine people lose their lives every day.  Did you do a cannonball off of Phuket?  A what?  Exactly.  No.  What is Phuket?  And I'm a fine person, too.  What is Phuket?  There's a lot of fine people.  What is Phuket?  I have no idea what a Phuket is.  A Phuket.  A Phuket.  A Phuket.  It's the type of mallet that should be swung into your fat face.  No. 
[02:35:30]  You called back, so this is what you get.  You don't know what Phuket is?  Do you know what Phuket is?  No, I don't know what a Phuket is.  What's that?  What is that?  Do you know that you're a waste of space?  Out of touch.  I am not a waste of space.  You do realize that, right?  You offer nothing to yourself, nothing to your son, nothing to your father, nothing  to your friends, nothing to society.  You offer absolutely nothing.  So why do you deserve to continue walking this planet?  Do you know everybody that knows you wants to put soap in their socks and beat your fat 
[02:36:00]  stomach in a marine barracks?  Ow!  Ow!  I don't know.  Ow!  Remember, drunk, it's just a bad dream.  You know how, do you realize how many people look at you and go, that are associated with  your life, they look at you and they go, oh, what a drag.  She's a complete drag.  Not the people that I know.  You are a disgusting fat body, Private Kyle.  No, not the people that I know.  Who is that Private Kyle? 
[02:36:30]  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir.  Is booze allowed in the barracks?  They're paying for it, you drink it.  Once again, you're calling a radio talk show.  I know.  What do you have for the program?  One more shot.  All right, one more shot.  I told you Lost in Space.  What?  I've been listening to the show, you're talking about Lost in Space.  Yeah.  Okay?  Now, you know, they should replay those episodes again.  They don't play them anymore. 
[02:37:00]  Why would that be interesting to a talk show?  Why would that be interesting to the thousands and thousands of listeners out there?  Why?  Well, I don't know.  I just figured I'd say that.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck!  You're all right to take me.  Shut up!  Will you?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, boy.  Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!  Shut up!  Well, that's all you were talking about for, you know, for the past hour. 
[02:37:30]  And your input is taking it to the next level.  And your input is they should replay them on TV.  And then you remember, and then she names all the characters so it will stretch out what  she's saying.  Oh, I used to watch that.  Young William.  I remember that so a lot of time.  I remember the best boy.  I remember the gaffer.  I remember the producer.  I know the key grip.  All right, I'm going to go with this a little bit because Anthony and I are very, very good  talk show hosts.  All right, I hope it comes down and we're very, we can make things out of shit. 
[02:38:00]  Lemonade out of these lemons?  Watch this.  Watch my skills, Anthony.  All right.  Go ahead.  So you're a big fan of Lost in Space, are you, Lady Di?  Well, I'm a big fan of Lost in Space.  All right, why don't you tell us what your favorite episode was and why?  My favorite episode?  I have, that's the nervous laugh, meaning she has nothing.  She has nothing.  What was your favorite episode of Lost in Space and why?  Okay, my favorite episode.  You know what? 
[02:38:30]  I don't have one.  There's a bunch of them.  I don't have a favorite episode.  They're all my favorite episodes.  All right, follow-up question because I'm a fine talk show host.  Well, just name one Lost in Space episode.  Oh, God, you got me.  I haven't seen that show in years.  But you said you liked it.  I haven't seen that show in years.  Name one.  Name one.  Name one favorite episode.  Name one episode.  Not even a favorite.  Just an episode.  Just an episode.  Go ahead.  One lousy effing storyline, you dummy. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  I'm not a dummy.  I just don't remember them.  Can you do anything?  We're asking her to name one episode from Lost in Space.  Hold on one second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you remember, Di, do you remember one time in your life when you were eating compulsively  and drinking alcoholically and someone leaned over and said, we finally found something.  You do well.  No.  Name.  No, I don't remember that.  You could be a drunk in my beloved core. 
[02:39:30]  I don't remember that.  Oh, 300.  Wasteline.  I don't remember that.  You don't remember.  Remember that episode when they were lost and they were in space?  You dolt.  You said you're a big fan of the show.  You knew the characters.  Name one show.  Why are you lying again?  I'm not lying.  Remember that episode where the Jupiter 2 was in orbit around you?  Oh, my God.  No.  All I know is that they were in space.  That's all I know.  Well, do you remember when Will Robinson was taken away from them because they couldn't 
[02:40:00]  care for him properly?  Do you remember that?  Remember that?  When they were drunk driving the spaceship and Will had to be taken away?  No, I don't remember that.  And Mrs. Robinson couldn't find a job?  I think there was an episode like that, Jim.  Remember Mrs. Robinson couldn't find a job, so they took the kid away?  They took young William away?  And she kept bullshitting everybody as to how she's looking for a job and she's going to  get her kid back?  Remember that episode?  Remember DVDs because I don't remember all those episodes. 
[02:40:30]  No?  Remember when she ate the whole hydroponic garden in one fell swoop?  And she went before the judge to get her kid back, but since her hair looked like Shelly  Duvall's, he decided against giving the young boy back?  Proving we can make something out of shit.  The only reason she couldn't beat Shelly Duvall is she's too fat to run around the overlook.  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to a bar?  As soon as possible? 
[02:41:00]  No, she just would have repeated it.  When do I think we should take Danny to a bar?  What?  Exactly.  Me and my friend Lady Di would drink alcohol without ever opening our mouths.  Candy Cane 12 to the liquor store.  Candy Cane 12 to the liquor store.  No.  Oh, but they're really...  The freezers full of Jack Daniels and Johnny Walker Red and cases of Budweiser. 
[02:41:30]  You could drink here every day for a year and not have the same drink twice.  You like bourbon, Doc?  Every once in a while, but not that much.  We call her a fat pig.  How did you know?  I don't know.  Well, she looks like a fat pig.  Would you like to live with your mother, Doc?  The judge says I'm not supposed to.  That is not nice.  Lady Di, we're not talking to you. 
[02:42:00]  They're doing movie clips, you stupid twat.  Okay, okay, I'm listening.  You're answering fucking movie clip lines, you retard.  Sorry.  Opie.  And they're not laughing at you.  I hope not.  So you have nothing on Lost in Space.  What else do you have for the program? 
[02:42:30]  You know what?  I have nothing.  I remember watching the episodes, but I don't remember any of the subjects on the episodes.  All I know is that they were in space.  Right, they were in space.  The show's called Lost in Space.  Wow.  I know that.  You could be the stupidest person that calls our show.  I'm convinced of it now.  You are really retarded.  Well, I don't know what to tell you.  You know your life is meaningless, right? 
[02:43:00]  My life is meaningful, not meaningless.  It's meaningless.  Meaningful.  You're going to pass, and there's going to be nothing that people are going to remember  about you.  Oh, come on.  Except for the fact that you fell down while you were drunk.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Let's get into it.  Get stoked.  Come on.  Get retarded.  Come on.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded. 
[02:43:30]  Let's get retarded in here.  Opie.  Opie.  You know, no one means to fall down.  It was an accident.  Oh, I can't breathe.  I fell down on my treadmill.  How many times must I have to say that?  You're a liar.  I'm not a liar.  You got punched in the jaw.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm not going to hurt you, die.  I'm just going to hit your face with a treadmill.  I had nothing to do with that. 
[02:44:00]  I fell down on my freaking treadmill.  Of course you did.  He even told you that.  You know, I mean, I mean, why did I lie about that?  I fell on a wire.  A couple of foot pounds per second per second.  I wouldn't hurt one hair on her greasy head.  Oh, my God.  I don't have a greasy head.  I love the fat bitch.  That is not nice. 
[02:44:30]  She has a period in the elevator.  That is so not nice.  You stupid bitch.  We're not talking about you.  You just happen to still be on the phone.  Okay.  Do you know what they're referring to?  Do you know what they're referring to at all?  What are they referring to?  Oh.  She knows not a clue.  She has not a clue.  For the people out there that are in...  Now they got it figured out because the music is playing. 
[02:45:00]  Okay.  What music?  You are really stupid.  All booze and no job.  All day makes I an unfit mother.  I am not an unfit mother.  I am not unfit.  I'm a very good mom, it's a matter of fact.  Of course you are.  All right. 
[02:45:30]  You're such a good mom.  Where's your son right now?  If you are a good mother, where is your son?  My son is in school right now.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Who does he stay with?  Who does your son stay with?  Does it make any difference right now?  Well, it's obviously not you.  If you're such a good mother.  If you're such a good mother, he would be with you, no?  Who just said that?  The beer bottle.  It's talking to you.  No, no, no.  My son right now.  The big pink elephant.  Don't worry about where my son stay. 
[02:46:00]  He's in the family, okay?  It's a big pink elephant talking to you, drunk.  Hello, Di.  How are you?  More beers.  No, no, no, no.  This is the elephant.  This is the elephant speaking.  Where is your son?  If you're such a good mother, where is he now?  He's not with you, so you're a horrible mother.  The elephant?  Who's this?  Oh, my God, this fucking whore.  Like, 20 seconds behind everything you fucking say.  And then when you talk, she asks you another fucking question, you stupid idiot.  Brother.  What?  Don't worry about where my son is staying.  Well, the point is, you say you're a good mother, but you can't be so good if they took 
[02:46:30]  him away and put him somewhere else.  Is that right?  You will never get him back, ever.  Di, do you realize that Jack Torrance was a better parent?  Mom Taff.  Mom Taff.  Mom Taff.  Mom Taff.  Mom Taff.  Hang up the phone.  Di, hang up the phone.  I'm not going to hang up the phone.  Hang up the phone.  Just admit that he got punched in the face and we'll all be friends again.  Look, I'm not going to be friends in the face. 
[02:47:00]  How could a 350-pound woman fall off a treadmill?  I'm telling you, do you want me to lie to you now?  How could a 350-pound drunk moose fall off a fucking treadmill?  Excuse me, I'm not 300-  You've never even seen a treadmill.  Yeah, lady, Di, you realize you're too wide to fall over, you idiot.  Well, you know, I'm not just coming myself.  Squeezing between the rails of the treadmill.  Right.  Who do you think you were fooling?  I fell on the wire by the treadmill where you plug it in.  Oh, no, the wire.  She wasn't even on the treadmill.  Now she fell over a wire on the treadmill. 
[02:47:30]  I fell over a thousand times.  She was going to say, I fell on the stairs that was the floor, three floors up from the treadmill.  But it was close enough, right?  I did fall down the stairs one time.  All right.  Of course you did, right.  And it was a punch to the fucking face.  You fell down the stairs.  No.  Don't they call it nowadays?  Cont.  No, I did not kick myself at all.  He's gone.  He's gone.  When I fell down the stairs.  But that did happen one time.  All right, Lady Di.  Yes.  This is a talk radio show.  We're not your friends.  I don't really care about your life at all.  And that's true. 
[02:48:00]  So if you want to call a program with something we're talking about, that would be great.  We love the input of the actual listeners of the show.  Okay.  But you have nothing.  Mom Taff.  Mom Taff.  Well, you know, I'm friends with yours.  I'll always be friends with you guys.  I've got to get up to the Overlook Hotel.  Well, the caretaker up there is a big, fat, unfit mother.  Turned out to be a real asshole. 
[02:48:30]  Hello?  Is anybody passed out?  Oh, boy.  I am neither, neither, and neither.  Okay?  I am not unfit.  Of course.  I am not fat.  Right.  You're not fat?  And she would have the same problem as Shelley Duvall, but it would be the front door she  couldn't get through.  Don't tell me.  I think it's not good.  Run!  Run, Danny!  Run!  Run!  I can't get through the front door! 
[02:49:00]  Oh, boy.  But I'm telling you that I will be okay.  Lady Di, if your scale is telling you you're not fat, you should throw it out the window.  You want me to step on a scale right now?  Yes, yes.  All right.  All right.  Hold on one second.  Can you get a Dewey in a car?  Yeah.  Then you can get a Dewey in the snowcat.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  I love these women that think they're not fat.  Hold on one second.  Again, on the scale, are we going to hear a boing?  No, you're not going to hear a boing.  Hold on. 
[02:49:30]  Duh.  You have to drive down Route 80 to find a scale that's appropriate?  All right.  Hold on one second.  You want to know my actual weight?  Yeah.  And you said, by the way, that you're not fat.  You don't think 195 is fat?  Well, it ain't skinny, but it's not big, big.  How tall are you?  Five foot seven.  You're a fatso.  I'm not a fatso.  Five seven, 195 pounds is fucking fat.  Okay, whatever you say, that's fucking fat. 
[02:50:00]  I would say five seven, 145 is fat.  I'm really surprised I'm 195 because, you know, about a month ago I weighed 200 pounds.  First of all, you're 197, so you're saying you lost three pounds in a month.  Actually, it says 190.  No, it doesn't say 190.  Jim.  You can't see it past your fat stomach.  You're trying to jump off and guess before the thing swings back.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to bring the scale over to the studio, and I'm going to prove it to you. 
[02:50:30]  Jeff from Maryland saying someone hit her with an axe in the chest.  Yeah.  Thank you.  No, I'm only kidding.  Oh, God.  Lady Di, you know, you're one of these people that,  when you do die,  that it's going to take them at least a week to ten days to even know that you're dead?  That is not true.  You're going to have to wait for the mailman to finally go,  Whoa, hey, something's going on here.  The mail's piling up. 
[02:51:00]  Maybe I should call the cops to investigate.  Because no one cares about you.  People saying she's slim if she's eight feet tall.  Okay.  I can deal with that.  I could be eight feet tall.  I could deal with that.  What?  I could deal with what they're saying.  I really need to lose weight.  That's okay.  You know.  You never will.  You're a waste.  You have no motivation to do anything.  You'll sit there, drink, not get a job, not get your son back. 
[02:51:30]  No, no, no.  You're just a mess.  No, and no, and no.  Bye, Lady Di.  Do you have anything on the Randy Johnson thing?  Because we're going to talk about that for a second.  Oh, Randy Johnson, he's going to make a good picture for the Yankees.  Why?  He's going to be okay.  Why?  Because, you know, well, first of all, you know, he's a very, very good pitcher.  Okay.  And second of all, second of all, I mean, you know, George Steinbrenner, he buys the best out of everybody. 
[02:52:00]  That's right, Maggie.  That's what you got on the Randy Johnson thing?  Well, third of all, he pitched a perfect game when he was with Arizona.  I remember that.  I saw that.  Let me ask you a question, honestly.  What subject are you informed about at all?  What subject?  Right.  Question with a question.  Am I informed about at all?  Right.  Two questions with a question.  Okay.  Two questions.  What?  Well, right now.  Drink the liquor.  Drink the liquor.  What?  Okay. 
[02:52:30]  No, no, no.  I'm good with the New York Yankees.  You're not good with the Yankees.  Just like you're good at talking about Lost in Space?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You're good at the...  You know what?  You're good at Yankee baseball talk.  All right.  Tell us something about the Yankees.  All right.  About the Yankees.  Their baseball team.  Yeah.  They have three perfect games so far.  Yes, they are a baseball team.  Duh.  I know that.  And third of all, no, they have like the best people on their team. 
[02:53:00]  The best people on their team.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  This is all you got on one of your favorite subjects, the New York Yankees?  Well, why not?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Listen to me closely.  And you're a Yankee fan, Anthony.  Shut up.  What subject, what subject do you think you are informed about?  One thing on the face of this planet that you know something about.  What is it?  Okay. 
[02:53:30]  Computers.  Computers.  You know about computers.  Yeah.  I know how to download stuff.  You know, stuff like that.  Have you ever seen a little child's hand on a mouse going click, click?  Yes.  They're downloading stuff.  That doesn't mean you know nothing.  You know nothing.  The only time your hand is on a mouse is when you're trying to jump on a chair to escape  him, you frightened elephant.  First of all, I don't have mice over here. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  What do you know?  There's no mice over here.  What do you know about computers?  I know how to download stuff.  How do you do that?  Well, very easy.  You know, you click on the button and, you know, you download it and you put it into your  file.  Your stupidity is monumental.  It is giant.  All right.  Ask me something else.  How about offering something?  What are you informed about?  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to tell you something I'm informed about. 
[02:54:30]  The Beatles.  All right.  All right.  Beatles talk.  That's good.  Good.  Good.  We're on to something.  Topical.  Good.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Ask me a question.  No.  Just speak about them in an informed fashion and not with your childlike knowledge.  Speak about an informed...  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  Just talk about the Beatles.  They're called George and Ringo.  Well, they're the next word if I've ever heard one.  You're a true maven.  I'm sorry I questioned your expertise.  I didn't realize you were going to sling out the obscure information. 
[02:55:00]  Well, what year was each one of them born?  You could ask me that.  Who cares?  Okay.  Never mind about that.  Exactly.  You're probably looking it up online right now.  What else do you want to know?  Yeah, trivia.  She knows, like, basic trivia.  Well, she's sitting on the toilet right now and she has, like, a Beatles book.  I'm in my toilet right now.  I'm in my living room.  What is a toilet, stupid?  I guarantee that I could get...  This is probably hack radio at its best.  I'm sure this has been done a million times.  But I guarantee we could get a 12-year-old in here that knows more than you do.  Yep. 
[02:55:30]  Guaranteed.  Well, why don't you ask me something about the Beatles?  I could tell you.  You tell us something about the Beatles.  Okay.  All right.  In my life, what record was it on?  I don't know.  And I don't care.  See?  It was on Rubber Soul.  Yeah.  And was the thing she wears away when she walks one mile with that fat body.  I'm asking you a question and I want you to tell me. 
[02:56:00]  You're asking a trivia question.  You're not speaking in an informed fashion.  All right.  I'll give you another one.  I'll cry instead.  What record was that on?  Your life.  Instead of taking care of your son, what are you going to do?  Stop already with that.  What record was that on?  And I'm saying record because it originally came out of record.  Why don't you do your son a favor and let someone else adopt them?  So he has a chance at a good life.  So he has a chance at a good life.  Yeah.  My son is okay. 
[02:56:30]  Well, maybe he wants to be more than okay.  Maybe he wants a mother that, you know, is there to love him and hug him and kiss him  at the end of his school day.  Not visit her at a flop house.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No.  With roommates while there's empties all over the place.  Maybe he wants to go home to a nice home with a nice cooked meal.  Yeah.  Well, when is that going to happen?  It's going to happen very soon. 
[02:57:00]  When?  Sooner than you think.  Yeah, sure.  Just like your job.  Well.  Lady died.  Bottles at her feet.  I got you stumped with the Beatles, didn't I?  I guess.  Stumped.  I guess.  What was the question again?  The records that, you know, the Beatles made.  I'll Cry Instead.  Oh, it was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Unfit Mother's Band.  No, it was not Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Unfit Mother's Band.  No, it was not.  Mother's Band? 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  Mother's Band.  I said Mother's Band.  No.  All right.  What album was it off?  Okay.  I'll Cry Instead was on a Hard Day's Night.  It was off a little album called A Hard Day's Night.  Ha ha.  A little song written in 1936.  I'll Cry Instead was on that album.  It was in the movie.  Well, you showed us.  Boy, this was much better than having Al Franken on our show.  What the hell happened to Al Franken?  I had no idea.  This was called Filler.  Will you shut up?  I'm not talking to you.  845 and 9.  He might still call.  He might still call?  Sure.  All right, Lady Di, proven once again you have absolutely nothing to offer society. 
[02:58:00]  I have.  Not just a radio show, but nothing to offer society.  If ever the world's safety hinges on knowing what Beatles song is on what Beatles album,  perhaps then they could phone Lady Di and she could save the world.  Other than that...  You ask me what I know about it, and I'm telling you what I know about it.  Other than that, your life force on this planet is worthless.  And I have all their records, and I have most of their movies, too.  They're awful movies.  No, they're not awful movies. 
[02:58:30]  They are.  No, they're not.  And you didn't speak in an informed fashion.  You gave a little trivia, which you probably have right in front of you.  Watch this.  What was your favorite Beatles movie?  My favorite Beatles movie?  Question.  It's a toss-up between A Hard Day's Night and Help.  All right.  I'm not the only one.  And why did you like the movie Help?  Well, I liked the movie Help because they were escaping from something.  You know, Ringo had the ring on.  Like your son escaping from you.  Yes.  No, no, no.  Ringo had that big ring on, and they were trying to, like, go after the diamond in the ring or something like that. 
[02:59:00]  What movie is this?  Help.  Oh.  I thought it was what you refused with your alcoholism.  No.  That's the name of the movie.  And you liked it because there was a ring, and they were trying to find the ring?  They were trying to cut the ring off of his finger.  Wow.  You should review films for the Times.  That was quite a synopsis.  Are you talking about Help or Lord of the Ring?  No, Help.  Oh.  All right.  I'll be Help. 
[02:59:30]  I was a little confused.  All right.  And what was your favorite scene in the movie?  Oh, my favorite scene?  Yeah.  When they play their music.  Every single time.  She doesn't know.  When they were by the beach and stuff like that.  All right.  When they were by the beach, and you were laying there, and people were throwing water on you?  They were playing music?  Don't I wish I was playing the movie?  Roll her back in.  All right, Lady Di, we've got to go.  I think Al Franken's calling in.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And we'll take a quick break.  We'll talk to Al Franken, hopefully next. 
[03:00:00]  It was Whip'em Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere, but my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.

The passion will be renewed this February, as spring training opens for the 2005 season.  The hopes and dreams of 30 major league teams are told on XM satellite radio like never before.  Down the left field line.  And is it enough?  And is it enough?  Good!  There it is!  62!  Over the next few weeks leading up to spring training, XM will count down the greatest 
[03:01:30]  play-by-play calls of all time.  Pitchers and catchers report on February 16th.  Don't miss a pitch this season on XM.  XM Satellite Radio is the official satellite radio partner of Major League Baseball.  It's everything XM 202.  XM News, Toss Sports, and Information 24-7. 
[03:02:00]  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[03:02:30]  The O.B. virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  He's coming.  Jimmy Norton stepped out for a second.  Little Jim.  On the phone, some intelligence, Anthony.  We just had the stupid segment, and hopefully this will be much more intelligent than that  last segment.  Got to say hi to Al Franken.  Al!  Hey, guys.  There he is.  How are you, sir?  Don't damn me with that intelligence thing.  No?  Well, you obviously weren't listening to the program. 
[03:03:00]  And we had someone on that was very, very stupid.  Who would that be?  This lady that we like to call Lady Di.  Yeah.  She's a very, very unintelligent woman.  Is this one of these things where you get, is she very, very sexy or something?  No.  No.  Not at all.  No.  She's going through some hard times.  I believe she drinks too much.  She doesn't have a job.  Her son was taken away from her.  And this is the stuff of humor on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Well, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  It could be.  It's one of those things where, you know, we're trying an intervention with her on the  air.  Oh, I see.  Slap some sense into her, but she doesn't seem to want to help.  Is she just like a regular caller who's just become a...  Yeah.  She's actually started out being a stalker on the show.  She'd come down to the studio and bring gifts and...  I like that you have this backstory on things.  It's like a...  I can't wait to have a backstory on our show.  We've got to be around a lot longer.  Well, she's one half of the retarded Laverne Shirley, if you really need to know. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, she's got a friend who's doing a little better than her.  Because her partner's just as dumb.  Well, I don't like that word.  Oh, no?  You don't like the word retarded?  Why?  Well, I think that it hurts the feelings of retarded people.  They don't...  Why?  They don't get it?  Retarded people.  You have a point there.  No, no.  I just...  I think it actually hurts the feelings of the parents.  That's true.  Of the people who are challenged.  We actually heard a tape of you at, I believe, the Democratic Convention talking to somebody 
[03:04:30]  from...  What the hell was that show called?  Hey, How's Your News.  How's Your News.  How's Your News?  Is it like a BBC show?  No, it's a show and it's done...  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Yes, yes, yes.  Mentally challenged newscasters.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I understand.  Yes.  Where the retarded kids interview...  Mentally challenged, Opie.  Well, yeah, yeah.  I mean...  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You express it the way you like.  And this guy was talking to you, and obviously it was very hard to understand anything he 
[03:05:00]  was saying.  Well, there were a couple guys, and one was smarter than the other.  Smarter?  Yeah, there was actually two guys who were...  I think they were both Down Syndrome, and one actually made a lot of sense and was pretty  smart.  It wasn't Bush and Cheney, was it?  Huh?  It wasn't Bush and Cheney, was it?  Oh, I get it.  No, no.  He's going to hate us.  I know it.  Yeah.  They're just...  You know... 
[03:05:30]  But...  And one made some sense.  Yeah.  And actually sort of stayed with...  We stayed with each other.  Yeah.  And then the other guy had made no sense.  Yeah, the other guy, I couldn't understand him.  You were being very diplomatic, Al.  So, Al, you don't like labels.  You don't like labels.  You don't like calling people retarded or any of that fun stuff.  Uh, well, liar.  I use liar probably more than a lot of people.  So, that's cool.  Heard that used a few times.  Yeah.  Retarded is a little inappropriate.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Listen, you're you guys. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You know, come on.  How do you feel about genetic disaster?  A genetic disaster?  Hey, we've got to laugh about it.  Come on.  Yeah.  You're a comedian.  Come on.  You can find...  That's funny, sort of, right?  Some of the irreverent stuff he's written.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  Hi, your son's a genetic disaster.  Ha, ha, ha.  See?  No one would laugh harder.  Exactly.  So, what do you got going on?  As they position the flowers in front of that part of the family photo? 
[03:06:30]  Did they position the flowers?  No, as they position the flowers in front of that part of the family photo.  You know, Jimmy kind of relating that perhaps some of those children will ruin the family photos.  Oh, I see.  Very inappropriate.  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I think Jimmy's just trying to be shocking, Al.  Not at all, actually.  I didn't bring it up.  Jimmy's trying to keep that shock jock tag or something.  Yeah.  Well, you're on satellite.  Yeah.  So, we got thrown off a regular radio, Al.  How does that work? 
[03:07:00]  Is that working well, the satellite thing?  It seems to be working very well.  We have the freedom to say a lot of stuff that we just used to not be able to say.  Right.  Of course, we still can't have a couple go into a church and have sex or anything.  Why not?  But we, I don't know, people seem to be a little sensitive about that.  Okay, I can see the church being sensitive.  Yeah, the church gets a little sensitive.  A couple of people write some letters, and then we get thrown off the air.  But you don't get thrown off satellite.  It's impossible.  No, satellite's pretty hard.  It's pretty hard.  If there is a way, we'll probably figure it out eventually. 
[03:07:30]  But, yeah, it's a little rough.  But then you go to the other satellite channel.  Yeah.  If they're still in existence, the way they're hemorrhaging cash, I don't think they'll be around for too much longer.  Sure.  Good, Jimmy.  What do you got going on on your program today?  Well, we got, let's see, we have David Brock, who is head of Media Matters for America.  He was the former right-wing hitman working for the Republicans.  Now he's a turncoat?  He's seen the light, and he is sort of monitoring them. 
[03:08:00]  He's like a media watchdog group, so he'll be, or heads it.  And he usually brings in some, you know, great lies and outrages coming from the right.  You guys love putting those turncoats on.  I love it.  Well, he really is.  He's someone, I think, who genuinely had a crisis of conscience.  I admire him, actually.  I have a question for you.  This is just, when we, I think when Ben called to get you on the show, because I'm actually 
[03:08:30]  a fan, we all love what you do, I think it was the agent of the publicist was asking us  what our political affiliations are.  I don't know if that comes from you, or if that's just them kind of being overprotective.  Why would they ask that?  Because I don't actually mind going on right-wing shows, because then, you know, usually, usually,  first of all, if you go on a right-wing show and the people aren't, the radio guy isn't  very smart, that's great.  Right.  And if you're smart, then it's fun, you know. 
[03:09:00]  So, I don't mind that at all, but that might have been, I don't even know who called you  up.  You might have been them just being a little bit, or maybe just giving you a heads up.  Okay.  Yeah, sometimes.  I mean, there is the occasional, like, right-wing person who is just so obnoxious.  I mean, in the sense of, I think, almost trying to provoke me from the beginning by saying 
[03:09:30]  things that are stupid, slash, not true, slash, insulting.  Kind of like a Ted Nugent.  You know, probably we'd get along.  Really?  On the Nugent show.  He's consistent.  I mean, Ted Nugent, he annoys me.  I'm more conservative.  He bugs me, too.  He's a bit self-righteous, but at least he's consistent.  Yeah.  No, I'm talking about it.  They're usually, I hate to say this, but it's often these women, these right-wing women.  Yeah.  Who, in addition to everything else, are quite, and it's men, too, but there's a certain level 
[03:10:00]  of ill-informed stupidity.  Yeah, the right-wing women are never as intelligent and likable as the left-wing ones, like Janine  Garofalo.  Well, I really do, and she's funny.  I'm talking about, you know.  Ann Coulter.  Well, Ann is, I'm talking about, you know, Ann is just deliberately dishonest and crafts 
[03:10:30]  her lies in a way that I find astounding and is sort of shrill and strident and mean.  And I'm talking about just plain old dumb.  Do you think, like, I seem like the Democratic Party seems to really kind of be looking for  somebody.  It doesn't seem like there's anybody coming out.  Because, like, you look at New York, which is typically very liberal, and yet they've  had, you know, two Giuliani's and one Bloomberg and Governor Pataki now, and it seems like 
[03:11:00]  in California they have shrill.  Well, I think we have Elliott  Spitzer is going to be a force in New York and in national politics.  You also thought Kerry was going to win, didn't you?  You're not that bummed that he lost, right?  Al?  I am bummed that he lost.  I mean, but do you honestly think he would have got the job done?  I mean, I was hoping that we would have gotten a much better candidate.  I think he'd have been a better president, certainly, than a candidate.  And, you know, I think he's a serious guy, and I think that's one of the reasons he lost, 
[03:11:30]  is that he's just, you know, kind of thoughtful.  I just think the Republicans know how to campaign better.  Well, this time they did.  Yeah.  In 1992 and 1996.  You're not from the school of, they stole Ohio this time around?  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, okay.  Our show, we call ourselves the most responsible show on radio.  We looked at that, and we had guys on from MIT and Cornell who were, you know,  experts in voting machines and in this process. 
[03:12:00]  No, we never believed in our show that the election was stolen.  We believe that there are irregularities and things to look at, and that we do need,  I cheered on Barbara Boxer, because I think it needed to be underlined that there were some  irregularities, and I think we need change by the next election to make sure, you know,  it's ridiculous to have Republican secretaries of state, or for that matter, Democratic secretaries  of state, making arbitrary calls about the way elections are held in states. 
[03:12:30]  I think the Democrats should concentrate in the next four years a little more on a candidate  instead of voting irregularities, though.  You know, you have four years to come up with a candidate.  I don't think that you do want the exclusion of the other, and I think, you're right,  I think we need, you know, as we, sometimes I consider myself in show business,  I call it casting, you know, we need another Clinton.  Guy had some harassment. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, that's easy to say, though.  You know, that's easy to say, but like a Barack Obama, he won't probably be ready in four years,  but there's a guy who I think everyone really responds to.  I don't think America's ready for a black president.  Unless he's conservative.  I think a conservative black president is a better shot.  No, I'm saying that he's a better shot, I think, and probably as a vice president.  It would have to be a guy like Colin Powell or somebody who people already like.  Yeah, well, Colin Powell said, no, I'm not going to do it.  And, but, you know, this is why I always said that, you know, as a Jew,  that looking at Colin Powell, I think the first Jew to be elected president 
[03:13:30]  will have to be a four-star general.  Yeah.  So he gave me the idea that we Jews should look for a high-ranking Jew in the military.  Good luck.  We're going to have to light out and get some research,  and unfortunately it turns out that currently the highest-ranking Jew in the military  is the comptroller of the Coast Guard.  So things aren't looking good on that.  No.  And what about Hillary?  You know, Hillary, I was kind of like after the election saying,  oh boy, she's divisive, you know, a lot of people don't like her, 
[03:14:00]  but she said something I thought was really interesting.  She said, yeah, well, Bush is divisive, and it seems to have worked for him.  So when she said that, I like Hillary tremendously.  I do, and I think she'd be a great president.  But, you know, the same question.  I mean, do you think the country's ready for a female president?  Well, again, I think it depends who it is.  Yeah, but the Democrats just have to stop with the gag, 
[03:14:30]  prop, gimmick-type candidates.  Well, I don't think that Kerry was a gimmick.  No, no, I mean, because looking to the future now,  you're hearing people talk about Obama and Hillary and stuff.  It's not a gimmick. I think he's the real deal.  Here's a guy who was, you know, head of the Harvard Law Review when he was at Harvard.  He, you know, had the chance.  Those guys usually have a chance to clerk for a Supreme Court judge.  I understand.  And that was a big, you know, corporate practice, 
[03:15:00]  and he went to the south side of Chicago and worked with...  Baddest part of town.  Huh?  South side of Chicago, baddest part of town.  Yeah.  Go down there, you better just beware.  And I think he's the real deal, I really do.  But has he done anything, though?  I mean, he made a great speech at the Democrat National Convention.  He's obviously a very charismatic guy and a very electric speaker,  but has he really done anything, like, politically,  that where you would go, okay, this is a guy for these reasons?  Yeah.  Or just his speaking ability?  He moved things through the legislature in Illinois, 
[03:15:30]  where he worked with Republicans and got things done.  Is he from Vernon Hills, Illinois?  Actually, I don't know what...  I think he's from the south side of Chicago in terms of where he went.  I don't think he...  He didn't grow up in Illinois.  Oh, okay, no, no, there's a club called Zanies out there.  You plug ass.  I did Zanies once, but it was in Chicago. 
[03:16:00]  No, there's one in Chicago, one in Vernon Hills.  Walked into a plug is what you did.  You just walked into a ginorm plug.  Are you doing Zanies?  Oh, this Friday and Saturday I'll be performing there,  but that was not why I mentioned that.  You see the worst or what, Al?  You know what, I know that Obama goes to the Zanies.  He loves that Zanies.  Loves to laugh.  Because that is a great Zanies.  They have only the best.  Let me ask, this is something that, like...  I mean, I'm a comic, too,  so I have to deal with a lot of the stuff in show business  and the people above you.  It seems like, to me, like the left in the last X amount of years 
[03:16:30]  has gotten very, very self-righteous and very, very...  Like, you know, the conservatives were always the ones  who suppressed freedom of speech.  I mean, look what happened to Lenny Bruce and blah, blah, blah.  And it seems like now it's the ultra-left who is doing that.  You mean, like, hate speech kind of stuff?  Not well.  Well, I think a lot of times genuine hate speech.  I mean, look at...  Let's look at this.  Who fined Howard Stern?  Oh, absolutely the conservatives.  Yeah.  All conservatives.  No, I mean, yeah, but, I mean, those people... 
[03:17:00]  The FCC there is conservative.  Michael Powell runs a conservative FCC.  Well, he was, I think, a Clinton appointee, but, yeah, I mean, that's all...  No, no, actually not.  No?  No.  All right.  Bush made him head of the FCC.  Oh, but wasn't he appointed to the FCC by Clinton?  I don't think so.  Yeah, I think he was.  Well, maybe, but whether or not it's now a Republican FCC...  Right, right, right.  ...and they're the ones who made the fine.  And the complaints all came from...  I think we talked about this once.  I think 99% of all complaints came from the parents' television council, which is obviously... 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, which is Brent Bozell's right-wing group.  Yeah, very conservative.  Yeah, so, I mean, I don't...  You know, I think it's easy to say that, oh, these liberals with their political correctness  are saying you can't say, you know, you hate black people.  What?  All that, you know, politically correct garbage.  But then when you...  I mean, like, for...  I'll give you an example.  Michael Savage, right from the time that Stern was being fined, Michael Savage was, during 
[03:18:00]  Abu Ghraib, was saying things like, you know, they should take these prisoners and take them  up in a plane and shove dynamite up their rectums and drop them from a plane.  Did he really mean that?  Yeah, yeah, and then that's fine.  All right, so you're saying he was being practical.  Well, he was...  I don't know, he'd just seen Scarface or something.  But what I'm saying is that hate speech seems to be fine to the FCC.  But hate speech is not illegal unless you're inciting somebody. 
[03:18:30]  Obviously, under freedom of speech, what do you have?  I think it's time, place, and manner.  You can't yell fire in a movie theater.  But hate speech is not an FCC violation, right?  Well, it seems obscene, doesn't it?  No!  I mean, isn't it just in the mind of what's obscene is in the mind of three FCC commissioners?  Well, here's what I will say about hate speech.  Legitimate hate speech, you know, kill Jews or kill blacks is disgusting.  That's legit, but yeah.  I know what you're saying.  I agree with that, but it seems to me like a lot of people, like I was arguing with some 
[03:19:00]  female comic once, she was saying Andrew Dice Clay spouted hate speech, and it seems  to me like on the left, a lot of times people will hide behind hate speech to just to quell  or quash things that they just think are unpopular and that they don't like.  Yeah, well, that's, you know, there's a difference here.  You can say, I don't like Andrew Dice Clay.  There's another thing about Andrew Dice Clay shouldn't be allowed to do what Andrew Dice Clay  does, which is ridiculous.  And I did, I did look...  That's why Andrew Dice Clay had some very funny stuff.  Agreed, but the point is that she was, what she was doing was hiding behind the term hate 
[03:19:30]  speech, which gets this knee-jerk reaction when it wasn't hate speech, and it also takes  away from genuine hate speech when it's done.  Yeah, I totally agree with that.  Well said.  Al, a better example is, you know, the FCC had no problem with, I think it was Sean Hannity  playing the audio of someone being beheaded.  Right.  You know, which I think is obscene.  I think it all should be on the radio, but if you're going to be talking about obscene,  I think that is much more detrimental to the children, because let's face it, it's all  about the children, as far as the FCC is concerned. 
[03:20:00]  You know, I think that's a better example.  I was outraged, even though I think it should be on the radio.  It's more disturbing to listen to than it is having some girl talk about her cans.  Right.  Yeah, to veer off, I was just at a USO show tour, and I went to Kuwait.  In Iraq and Afghanistan, and God, I met a soldier who was in counterintelligence in Kuwait  who had just come out of Iraq, and with tears in his eyes, he explained part of what his 
[03:20:30]  job was in counterintelligence, which was to view the tapes of guys, of people getting  beheaded, and so that he could try to determine if it was the same people doing it each time.  And he just said, you know, I've seen things that people no one should ever have to see,  and at a certain point, evidently, he couldn't take it anymore.  And there is this morbidity in our culture that is, I remember debating Ann Coulter, and she 
[03:21:00]  was saying that Abu Ghraib was over-covered, and that we weren't covering the beheadings  enough.  And her argument was that on the internet, the beheadings are the most clicked-on things  or whatever.  And I said, that's because people just are morbid.  That's not because they are more interested in the, you know, torture or the abuses of the 
[03:21:30]  terrorists.  Isn't that the same reason they looked at the Abu Ghraib photos, the same morbidity?  Really?  Yeah, I would think so.  Yeah, except the importance of showing the Abu Ghraib photos was, we're responsible for  that.  You know what I mean?  Let me tell you something.  When I look at anything having to do with the beheadings, it's really horribly disturbing.  When I was looking at the Abu Ghraib pictures, you know, okay, obviously we shouldn't have been 
[03:22:00]  doing that.  Of course.  But it was nothing that made me go, oh my God, this is so horrific, I cannot even believe  that this is happening.  And now, this is one thing, when you talk about, like, the way we covered Abu Ghraib,  people in this country were outraged.  When you look at the beheadings, or how Al Jazeera wouldn't show, what Margaret Hassan,  her name was, I think, remember when she was making a plea for her life and she passed out  and they threw water in her face, and even that was so reprehensible, they wouldn't, Al Jazeera  wouldn't show it, and I think they wouldn't show it because they knew that on some level they 
[03:22:30]  agree with the motives of these terrorists, if not the means, and they felt it would hurt  the cause.  Al Jazeera wouldn't show that because they knew it would hurt the insurgents' cause.  Yeah, why, you know, I think that that should have been shown by Al Jazeera, and I think  that, you know, and I think it was right for us to show Abu Ghraib.  I agree.  Because it's our responsibility.  Well, you know, what's interesting is I did a U.S.O. show at Abu Ghraib last month.  It was the first one done at Abu Ghraib, and, you know, the guys serving there now are living 
[03:23:00]  with the stigma of what happened, and they're different people.  And I am, believe it or not, I was traveling with the sergeant major of the army, who was  the highest-ranking non-com in the army, and he was leading our tour, and the commander  at Abu Ghraib introduced him by saying, let's give a warm Abu Ghraib welcome, too.  I'm kidding you.  With no irony whatsoever. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, that's funny.  That's the way it was like from there, oh my God.  Do you think, here's the thing I've always think, do you think the main problem with Abu Ghraib  was that people were so outraised, or the fact that people just don't like Lindy England  because she kind of looks like John Larroquette?  I thought you were going to say John Cougar Mellencamp.  I think that it was, you know, we're better, we're supposed to be better than that.  Yeah, I agree. 
[03:24:00]  It was a huge, I mean, huge, on the one hand, showing it, I mean, it's a huge tackle mistake.  And, you know, and we have done everything it seems like we could to build this insurgency  from the very beginning, from not securing, you know, these, so that what wasn't looting  to not building up their infrastructure and spending money on reconstruction, all that 
[03:24:30]  stuff we just screwed up.  But it seems like every time, this is the thing I disagree with, because it seems like  every time we try to get the infrastructure going, whether it's the police or the army  or the pipeline, insurgents blow it up.  And, like, you know, I mean, al-Zarqawi, I guess what, came over from Afghanistan.  And it just seems like as soon as Saddam was captured and people realized that, okay, he  really is gone, that's when everything heated up.  And I'm wondering, like, al-Sadr.  Well, no, I mean, everything heated up before then, they were saying, oh, they're desperate,  that's why this isn't happening. 
[03:25:00]  What we should have done is, and I talked to officers over there, and the more I got to  know them, the more frank they seem to be.  And they believe that, first of all, a lot of them believe we never should have gone in.  That's not to say they're not trying to do their job.  But many of them are very, very angry at Rumsfeld for not sending in enough troops at the  beginning, because we could have secured the country, could have prevented looting.  You remember when the looting started, Rumsfeld said, well, people in a free society are free 
[03:25:30]  to do what they want.  And they aren't.  We aren't.  I didn't know that.  We in the United States are not free to loot.  No.  And I think that was that mindset, which is that they're not like us.  They're subhuman or something.  No, no, no.  My point is, where was this anger, like al-Sadr, who Saddam murdered his father, where was  his uprising and his anger when Saddam was there?  Against Saddam, right.  We haven't been perfect, but let's be honest, anyone that can make a comparison between the 
[03:26:00]  U.S. military and the reign of Saddam Hussein, they're obviously completely separate things.  So where was this anger and this outrage?  And insurgency.  Where was it when he was raping and murdering them at an alarming rate?  Well, we were, of course, helping him.  How?  Well, by arming him.  Well, when did we arm him?  When he was fighting Iran?  We helped bin Laden.  We armed him in the 80s.  We gave him loans.  But that was to fight the Iranians.  Top-loading VCRs?  Yeah, to fight the Iranians.  The 80s.  Exactly.  But that wasn't helping him kill his own people. 
[03:26:30]  That wasn't an intent.  Oh, yes, it was.  Why don't you think he gassed the Kurds?  No, no, no.  But I'm saying that wasn't the intent.  That wasn't the intent.  Yeah, but he would gas the Kurds and then we'd help them.  Yeah, but we sold all these planes to Iran right before the Shah was overthrown by the  Ayatollah.  I understand that.  It wasn't done with the intent of using these planes to kill people, although the Iranians  couldn't figure them out.  Yeah, we're not so much talking about the equipment that we were giving to help them.  We were aware of what Saddam was doing while, and then in spite of being aware of what he 
[03:27:00]  was doing, we were helping him.  Well, he was gassing the Kurds when?  In the 80s when we were helping him fight Iran?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you remember Rumsfeld went over there and shook his hand, and we, at that point,  were more afraid of Iran.  So after he had gassed the Kurds, we continued to support him.  We supported him all the way through until he invaded Kuwait.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then, you know, that's quite a few years ago now.  Where was this insurgency? 
[03:27:30]  I know, but you're asking me, where was our outrage when he was gassing?  No, no, where was the outrage of the people, I'm saying?  Where was the uprising of the people like al-Sadr?  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, well, they lived in a horrible dictatorship, and if they were, you know, what we've done  is, you know, one of the officers up there told me, a pretty high-ranking officer said  that he had been in the Gulf, the 91 Gulf War, and he felt that Bush had made the right 
[03:28:00]  call, the first Bush, because he said that Saddam was the lesser of three evils.  And I said, well, what are the other two?  And he said, the Sunnis and the Shias.  And, you know, I think we went in there very believing our own propaganda.  I think we went in believing Chalabi, who, it turns out, is, you know, Iranian spy.  I, we just, you know, we had a president who went to war, basically, because he felt God 
[03:28:30]  told him to go to war.  Well, you just said, you just said that, that Saddam gassed his own people, and that they  were living under a horrible dictatorship.  Right.  But in the same thing, the left will kind of say, well, we never should have done anything  to get him out.  Well, I don't, yeah, I mean, I don't think that, there's horrible dictatorships all over  the place.  Do you want to, do you want to invade Sudan right now?  No, no, no, but no, no, I'm not saying we should invade every place, but it just seems  like you can't win when it comes to the left on this one at all. 
[03:29:00]  Like, if we don't invade, we're wrong for not helping, and if we do invade, we're wrong.  No, I don't think people said that.  I think, I think people on the left were saying we should contain the guy.  And we should do something in Sudan, to be honest with you.  We should do something, I don't know what.  Well, we should do something.  I mean, Muslims are, you know, not behaving well.  Well, I mean, and also, in Sudan, they killed a couple million Christians in southern Sudan.  And, I mean, if we weren't stretched so thin in Iraq, it's, you know, there's all kinds 
[03:29:30]  of places in the world where we could use our forces.  We have, you know, North Korea and Iran actually are developing or have nuclear weapons.  We were told because Bush wanted there to be nuclear weapons in Iraq or a program to develop  them.  We were told that there were, and there weren't.  Yeah, we all found that out.  Yeah.  Delper, actually, today, it's in the paper today, they're just completely giving up. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, they gave up on the WMD.  I mean, and yet, most people who voted for Bush believed that they had found WMD in Iraq.  Can't we all just get along?  People voted for Bush.  Can't we all just get along?  Didn't want to.  It's Team America.  Huh?  We're just wishing everyone could just get along now.  And the next time we talk to you, can we have to wrap this up, but the next time we 
[03:30:30]  talk to you, there were no WMDs, but we'll talk about how Hans Blix did say that he thought  Saddam was bluffing to make the world think he had them to avoid an invasion.  Very good.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  It's a real complicated.  We fell for what Saddam was doing.  I think Saddam was actually pretending he had them to scare other people, you know, his  enemies in Iraq and Iran and to be a big guy in the Arab world.  I've got WMD. 
[03:31:00]  Right.  And he fooled everybody.  And he fooled us because we'd go like, why would he pretend to have them?  Final question, Al.  Final question.  Eddie Murphy, good guy?  I like Eddie, yeah.  I mean, I don't know Eddie that well.  When was the last time you talked to Eddie Murphy?  Well, it would be a while ago.  It would be a while ago.  Probably, I can't remember.  I can't remember.  You know, I did a film.  I did Train Places with him.  I love him.  Wow, that's right.  He wasn't.  Of course he was in it.  I love that movie, by the way.

Maybe we could get into that a little bit.  I mean, he had some really interesting things to say about the Catholics.  All right.  In honor of Al Franken, let's play this, and we'll continue.

Yeah  I love when we get serious  And do politics all of a sudden  It goes back to an old joke  Or old thing  We talked about  In an interview  Yeah  It comes in  This just in  CNN is doing dick jokes  He's doing dick jokes  You know  You get someone like Al Franken on  Yeah  I don't agree with his politics at all 
[03:38:30]  But I'm not going to get into one of those  Stupid yelling matches  That just are  All showbiz  Yeah  Let the guy express his points  We'll chime in with ours  And that's it  Just in crossfire  Because then if you get into a yelling match  Then you'll get  Half of the instant feedbacks are  You know  You conservative  Lick ass  You suck  You know  And then if you're too light on him  It's like  Oh you liberal ass  You can't win  Damned if you do  Damned if you don't  I was just going to say that  Right or wrong 
[03:39:00]  You got to take up my philosophy  What's that?  I just don't care what the listeners think  I don't care  I really don't care  I should have just done Beatles trivia  Yeah  What a tool  All right  Well hopefully Joe Rogan's going to call  Before the show ends  I hope so  We're running out of show here  I don't know  I don't want to get physical with him  The Randy Johnson soap opera is pretty much over  Yesterday we were talking about Randy Johnson  A cameraman got in his face  While he was trying to get his physical done  And it was a whole big thing  Looked like Randy Johnson was just having a bad day 
[03:39:30]  And just didn't want  Yeah  I just didn't  I don't know  Because the cameraman really didn't do anything  He really didn't  I don't think he's used to that kind of thing  Well Randy Johnson  Obviously just signed with the Yankees  There's a lot of interest there  So of course you're going to have the paparazzi  And the camera people  Following your every move  For the first week or so  And then he'll die down more or less  I think they'll hound him for a while  Well  Especially after what happened  He was just on Regis  Pitching to Regis  Pitching to Regis  Look at what a big guy you are  Let me see that schlong  I bet you hung like 
[03:40:00]  Herky-jerky Ben  So Randy Johnson went on Letterman last night  We got a quick clip  But the saga is officially over  I'm sure the press was  You know  I'm sure the press was told  Like you know  Get on this guy  And I'm sure his people  Probably told him  Look this is New York  The press is really going to hound you  So the first time  He gets  They get together  He kind of 
[03:40:30]  You know  Was really on the defensive  Because I'm sure his people said  Look  You got to watch the New York press  New York press is notorious  For being scumbags  Yeah the camera guy  Don't let them all off the hook  Yeah that camera guy in particular  Didn't do anything that bad  He didn't really do much now  But  The New York press is scumbag  So he was probably  Really on his guard  And when that happened  He figured he'd  Jump at him first  And  He came off looking like  An idiot  Hey don't talk back to me  Yeah  Don't talk back to me  I'm a cameraman  I'm taping you  I'm not talking to you  You know  Sometimes you'll find him in bushes 
[03:41:00]  Yeah  You know  These camera people  They'll be in bushes  While you're in  They'll hide  While you're in the ER  With your daughter  And  Some people wonder why  You know  The photographers  Would be in the bushes  Yeah  How would they even know  I'm at the ER  With my daughter  Yeah  But they got a job to do  And the pictures  Don't get printed  Because sometimes  You make  You make a deal  With the newspaper  That you'll give them  An exclusive interview  Right  If they bury that story  So you know  They'll work with you  A little bit  Sometimes  But in general 
[03:41:30]  I don't care  I really don't care  Myself  We're going to replay  The latest  I don't care  By the way  I don't care  But first  Here's Randy Johnson  On Letterman  Putting this to bed  Anthony  Putting this to bed  And what did happen  Earlier  Was it yesterday  With the guy  With the camera  I'm talking about that  To me  Honest to god  A guy comes up  And sticks a camera  In your face  You can't do that  You're absolutely right  I was wrong  No you were not wrong  Yeah you had the mistake 
[03:42:00]  Of taking your face  Out of the hotel  Well I guess  Coming from a small market  In Montreal  Where I first played  Arizona  Seattle  I guess I'm just not used  To photographers  Jumping out of the bushes  And all that  But there's no doubt  I was wrong  No  No please  Please  You didn't do anything wrong  Alright you're right  You're completely backwards  This guy was a goon  And a thug  You're right  He should be apologizing  To you  Applause break  Turn on the applause signs 
[03:42:30]  For Letterman  Hey he should be apologizing  To you right  Right  Hey  Hey  Dave stop  Good thing Randy's not a comic  Dave would have bumped him  For two weeks  First of all  The cameraman didn't  Jump out of the bushes  Maybe he was talking  Figuratively  He did kind of  Come out of nowhere though  Like all of a sudden  Boom there he is  I think Randy Johnson  Handled it well  By going on the show  I was going look  I was wrong whatever  Yeah definitely  That's what you gotta do  Oh he's smiling  In the papers today  Here in New York  Oh anytime a camera's 
[03:43:00]  In front of him now  Well believe me  Jimmy could get a picture  With him now  Just walk up to him  Hi can I get a picture  Sure  Jim Norton  XM Radio  Can I have a photo  Sure  I'll stop by the house  And take one  Come on in  I hope Gene pushes somebody  Then I can ask for a picture  When he agrees  I can go no  And tell him his audio tape  Stinks  Oh that  That would really make you happy  Yeah that's gonna happen  That's not a chance of happening  Probably not  I'm just speculating  Peculiar  With him a little Marianne  You know  Maybe people in Australia  Oh this guy's really interesting  Tell us more about your philosophy 
[03:43:30]  Your philosophy that only works  If you're a rich rock star  Yeah if you're a bassist  In one of the biggest rock bands  Of all time  Sure  Sleep with who you want  That advice works  If you're a schlub  Driving a forklift  Just tell your wife  That you want to see other people  Yeah  Tell her you want to see other people  Oh really Gene  You can do that  Yeah  Why  Because you're rich right  Yeah  No Gene  No  If he talks one more time  About the species  The gender  Or the instincts  I'm gonna take a spitball 
[03:44:00]  And blow it in his stupid lower lip  Big fat lower lip  Drive safely  Drive safely  You just let Uncle Ted  Do all the  Shut up  Yeah you're brave  Now that he's not  In front of your face  I'm a dude  I like Nugent  I'm not intimidated by him  I think he's a bright guy  But I don't think he's this  Watch out  This caustic genius  Is stopping through  Loud never impressed me  Caustic genius  But you understand  What I'm saying  I think he's  Next time he's on the phone  You can tell him yourself  Well he was okay  But the only thing  I didn't like 
[03:44:30]  I told you this  Was that he thought  That by saying something  We were just playing  Devil's advocate  I was just making a joke  I was like  Relax dude  Just pay attention  To what's going on  In the moment  Don't lump every radio  Person you talk in  You know like  We're all like  Uh oh  Nugent's stopping through  Better be on guard  Yeah  Yeah  No one cares  You like guns  Another rich rock star  Speaking of not caring  Quickly  Because we have to  Play this again  I don't care  Because I know  The cease and desist  Is on it's way  I'm sure  Oh it's gotta be  So we should get  Our fill before  We have to say goodbye  To this  But we got the latest 
[03:45:00]  Howard I don't care thing  This is from yesterday  Right  I don't know  He's doing it all the time  He's doing it  Yeah every day  There's just this rant  Of I don't cares  This is the latest one  And he doesn't care so much  That I think he's starting to care  He's starting to care  Or he's starting to try to say  That him not caring  Doesn't mean he cares  Right  For everyone to know  For everyone to know  That him not caring  Doesn't mean that he cares  Because he actually  Because it's starting to look like  He might care  Because he's not caring so much 
[03:45:30]  And he's pretty much  Telling people that  No  He truly doesn't care  Oh  Oh car chase  Pedestrians  Oh  What happened  I don't know  That guy  He's like cutting people up  He's hitting people  There's a car chase on the TV  So I was a little distracted  But he drove up a road  And then  There were pedestrians  Crossing the street  Oh  And he actually stopped  I heard he made the engine loud  So no pain in the ass  Innocent bystander pedestrians  Would get in the way  So  Anthony 
[03:46:00]  In honor of Howard Sterns  I think he's 55 today  Yeah  Happy birthday man  There you go  I might be off by a year  But I think  I think it's the big 5-5 this year  Either way  He's  Off by a year  There's no way he's 56  He's not 56  Either way  He's closer to 60 than 40  So  Whatever  That way you know  Yeah  You know  That's a real good age  To go into satellite radio  A new venture  Sure  Work for so many other people  At the end of their careers  But man  Good luck to you  So here's the latest  I don't care Anthony  Right  From our pal  Howie

[03:48:00]  Who  Who  Who  We're losing an intern  Oh Noah's going  Yeah  We're losing an intern  Two interns actually  Yeah  Who's the other one  Mike  Oh no he was never really here  Oh  He was a nice guy  We didn't get to hang with him that much  But he was a nice guy  He did a nice job  He was very quiet  Yeah quiet  He was a quiet fellow  He didn't get to bang a porn star  Like  Yeah  Like our intern Noah  Yeah 
[03:48:30]  Noah had sex with a porn star  We'll always have that  You'll always have that  To take away from this program  We will be talking about that  For years to come  Great  I just found out today you're leaving  What are you  Why are you leaving  I'm broke  I have no money  And I can't really afford to do this anymore  I got another job somewhere  So I got to pretty much make that my priority  Okay  Yeah  But you know  You want to promote your new job  Not really  I've been over there for a while  I'm a producer for another radio show in New York  Cool  Oh  It's not on 57th Street  Is it  No  Boy Noah  Somewhere else  N-N-Noah 
[03:49:00]  N-N-Noah  Are you still in touch with the porn star  Yeah  I forgot her name actually  Candy  Candy  I think she's coming into New York  At the end of the month  She wants to do the show again  But she's supposed to get in touch with her  And you won't be around  Hmm  Yeah  Jim you might have a shot  Give me a shot  Maybe I can get it for $250  Yeah  There's a whole new batch of interns coming in  We have  I'm going to look out  Would you mind if she banged another intern  Not really  That would hurt you  They're still into each other  Danny's got thumbs up in there  Ha 
[03:49:30]  We gave Danny a shot in here allegedly  And we saw what happened  Allegedly  Yeah  Allegedly  Old baby pinky dick  Allegedly  On the show that allegedly never happened  Never happened  Never happened  So you're sad you're going to be leaving the program  I'm really sad  I had a great time  Well you come back and say hi anytime you want  Anytime  And you won't have to get coffee  You can just come in and say hi  Hang out  Yeah  We say that but does it ever happen  Do people ever come back and say hello  No  They don't  So this is pretty much goodbye 
[03:50:00]  Yeah  Farewells are never you know  Or see ya  Kind of things  Do you have anything you might want to say to the audience  Hulk music  Well yeah Hulk music would be very appropriate of course  Although we're not booting Noah  He's leaving because he has  Well this is his goodbye officially  He might come back as a guest you know  Yeah  But this is it  Noah  Thanks guys for the opportunity to be here  I had a really great time  I learned a lot about radio  And what you guys do  And I'll never really forget it 
[03:50:30]  You learned a lot about porn stars too  Porn stars  The ins and outs of porn stars  Apples and the advantage to a crispier one  Oh true true  Don't get mealy apples  Don't get coffee unless it's a Starbucks  He was the one that brought in the mealy apple  Everyone has been guilty of that  Except for young Danny  I don't know where he goes  And he won't tell anyone  Oh really  He's trying to keep that as his plus  Yeah he's a crispy apple boy  Of course  He's good at it  Probably brings him from home  Little dude  Should I give him your mom's box? 
[03:51:00]  Oh very good  Your last words should be your mom's box  So as you walk out that door Noah  Let it happen  Oh he has taken the headphones off  A fine intern  And a good guy  Alright  Your mom's box  Your mom's box  As he walks away  There he goes  Just walk away  Just walk away  There he goes  Oh god you nailed him with that one too  Jimmy totally got him  He was hoping and wanting  Like there was one more thing we needed from him  And you just nailed him 
[03:51:30]  Very good Jimmy  We got new interns?  Yeah  Yeah  I'm sorry to see Frank's gonna be going  Alright well  Do we have an intern that showed up after the show is over?  I'm hearing these stories  Yeah  We got two good ones  We got one that they thought at XM and DC was a convict or something  That would have been in jail which is totally not true  And this guy showed up at 10.15 yesterday  Oh that's very helpful  Maybe he was just early for today  How do you show up at 10.15? 
[03:52:00]  I know that's what I'm thinking  Hey what's up man?  Hey  How you doing?  Good how are you?  Look at this young go-getter  Sure is  Shows up at the crack of 10.15  You only showed up at 10.15 yesterday?  Yeah  Why?  My alarm didn't go off  Ah the alarm  Our own Eric used that one  Actually his alarm went off  But it was a fire alarm  We don't even still  Don't understand it to this day  Why not?  Let's not forget the other intern we had  That swore that the lights went out  And that's why he couldn't get up for his alarm 
[03:52:30]  Right  And then we had another intern  That didn't show up  He said he had gotten into a car accident  And glass went in his eye  And he came in with an eye patch on  Two weeks later  And after two hours of grilling  We actually got him to take the eye patch off  Show us that nothing was wrong  And admit he was lying  It was the most uncomfortable  One of the most uncomfortable moments ever  He was grilled  We grilled him like you would grill a murder suspect  It didn't stop  We pounded this for two hours  We just pounded this guy  And finally broke him down  Brian was his name 
[03:53:00]  Yeah  Good old Brian  He came and he said that a motorcycle  He was driving a car  And a motorcycle had blown a light  And hit the door of his car  And broke the passenger window  And got glass shards in his eye  The driver's side window  Got glass shards in his eye  And then we were questioning  What hospital he went to  He said he went to the hospital  Then he didn't go to the hospital  And his story crumbled live on the air  And it was great  Because he finally just was like  I had nothing  No I was going to mention her 
[03:53:30]  But first Jesse  Jesse was the one who claimed  That he didn't come in  Because his alarm clock didn't go off  Yeah Jesse was full crap  Jesse was always lying  And then it was like  But there was no  Well because he said  There was a power outage  Yeah  And then we called all our friends  You know like cops and stuff  And like there were no power outages  In the entire tri-state area  Yeah  We just wear people down  Until we admit the truth  We must just pound it and pound it  And then there was the intern Luca 
[03:54:00]  Who came in all bruised  That's why we named her Luca  Right  I don't even know what her real name was  She lived on the second floor  Right  She lived on the second floor  Yes Jimmy  And I don't know  She just kind of went away  It was the weirdest thing  She came in all bruised  She disappeared one day  And then she kind of disappeared  And we've been looking for her ever since  We got calls from like her friends or something  That said we haven't been able to find her  She lived up in Harlem  She never came back  It was weird  That was a weird one  It all beat up  Well  What's your young buck's name?  Yeah what's your name?  Travis  Travis  Travis  Yeah 
[03:54:30]  Very good  And your alarm didn't go off  Well I guess I technically didn't set it  Because I realized that I set it for 3pm  Ah  Which would have been even late for our afternoon show  Yeah  Yeah  It was supposed to be 3am  Yeah  And you showed up  Why did you decide to come in?  I just woke up at 8 o'clock  And I just hopped on the train and came in  I didn't even think about it  Where do you live?  Burbank, California?  No, Long Island  Oh, Long Island  Very good  Interns are dumb  You probably could have called 
[03:55:00]  Except for Nathaniel  Did you call when you woke up?  And Danny  And Danny  Emailed Steve  I don't like the fact that all the interns have the exact same haircut  That really bothers me  Every one of them have that little short coiffed mess on the top of their heads  Including this young sociopath  You do look like a little psychopath  You know that I'm not making fun of you of course  I'm Anthony  We will reschedule the Joe Rogan interview  PR person thinks he overslept  Okay  Thank you Ben for that  Maybe he set his alarm for 3pm  He's on the west coast 
[03:55:30]  And Joe definitely wants to be on our show  He's a friend  So  Alright, well thank you  Whatever your name is  It'll take you a month to remember  Travis  Travis  That's it  Alright  Travis  Totally nailed  Totally nailed  Turned around so fast  His stupid glasses fell off  Charlie from Cleveland  Up late last night  Burying a prostitute  Were you?
