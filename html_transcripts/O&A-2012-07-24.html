<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment heavily focused on the Aurora, Colorado mass shooting and the shooter's perceived malingering in court.  The hosts and callers expressed extreme anger and disgust, using vulgar language to describe their feelings and desire for retribution.  The conversation expanded to the treatment of prisoners, with several callers—former inmates and correctional officers—detailing the perceived lack of justice and coddling of dangerous inmates within the prison system.  A tangent developed comparing American and Chinese infrastructure and societal structures, prompted by a caller’s recent experience in China, highlighting the efficiency of Chinese construction despite questionable labor practices.  The discussion circled back to the Aurora shooter, speculation about a Minka Kelly sex tape, and a lengthy digression into baseball players Rod Carew and Ichiro Suzuki.  The absence of former co-host Ira was briefly mentioned.

The next segment started with Opie discussing his sleep apnea treatment and briefly touched upon Mayor Bloomberg's threats and the Penn State ruling.  The majority of this segment centered on a humorous bit involving intern Connor's struggles to deliver a simple order of coffee, cottage cheese, and a banana.  The hosts playfully mocked Connor’s ineptitude, delving into his insecurities, past bullying, and dating life.  The conversation then shifted to WWE Raw 1000, specifically Brock Lesnar, Triple H, and the "Ass Man" theme song.  More ribbing of Connor followed, culminating in a positive affirmation session over the phone.

The discussion then turned to gun control, spurred by Mayor Bloomberg’s interview with Piers Morgan.  Opie, Anthony, and a caller debated stricter gun laws, discussing enforcement difficulties, identifying dangerous individuals, and the relative prevalence of handgun versus assault rifle violence.  The legality of buying large quantities of ammunition online was also addressed.  The show revisited old comedic bits, including a Spanish-language version of their "Bill’s Dead" prank call and a discussion of wrestling fan fiction. The segment concluded with a call about Opie's .50 caliber Desert Eagle and a racist encounter at the shooting range.  Brad Thor, a New York Times bestselling author, was mentioned as a scheduled guest.

A subsequent segment focused on gun control, sparked by a recent mass shooting.  Callers described vastly different experiences purchasing firearms in Texas (easy) and New York (difficult), highlighting varying state regulations.  The hosts expressed skepticism towards Bloomberg's stance, pointing out perceived inconsistencies.  The effectiveness of gun control in crime deterrence was debated, with callers offering examples of high-crime cities with strict gun laws and vice-versa.  A caller detailed purchasing an AR-15 in Pennsylvania, contrasting it with New Jersey regulations.  The discussion included hypotheticals on the Aurora shooting’s outcome had armed citizens been present.  Later, Brad Thor joined the studio, discussing his book "Blacklist," sharing anecdotes, and offering his perspective on gun ownership and experiences in Afghanistan, including a humorous story about a parent-teacher conference.

The final segment began with a discussion about a news story involving a booby-trapped apartment. This transitioned into a conversation about surveillance technology and government overreach.  Brad Thor continued the discussion, elaborating on themes in *Blacklist* and his experiences in Hollywood and with various public figures, expressing concerns about the national debt and political dysfunction.  The hosts then engaged in a humorous guessing game to identify a movie they initially panned but found unexpectedly funny; it turned out to be a slapstick comedy reminiscent of *The Three Stooges*.  Further banter ensued, mentioning celebrities like Curtis Stone and the *Jersey Shore* cast.  The broadcast concluded with plans for a future Chicago show and more jokes about the aforementioned movie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Not the best.  Morning. Look who's here again.  Who? Who? Us. Who? Oh yeah.  We are. Hi everyone.  Hi.  Yes.  Dan. Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  I'll start.  Yeah.  For the rest of the media, because I guess we're part of the media.  The media.  The Joker is faking.  Yeah.  Could one of you assholes be brave enough to go, the Joker is faking.  They throw it out there like it's an aside.  And still trying to play the Joker. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  That's how much of an asshole this Colorado douchebag is.  He's faking.  Stop trying to read into it like, oh, look how crazy he is.  Is he on drugs?  No.  Oh my God, we found out he's not on drugs.  No.  So this must be really crazy behavior.  No.  He's still playing the role of the Joker.  And he thinks that's how the Joker would be in a court, in a courtroom.  He looked like somebody.  Holy fuck.  Trying to act like they're crazy.  Of course.  He didn't look like a real crazy person looks when you see an honest to goodness crazy person 
[00:01:30]  in court.  Right.  No.  He looked like a guy.  You could try and say, let me look crazy.  You could see he was trying.  You could see it.  Yeah.  It was obvious.  Do you have to be crazy like myself to know crazy?  Because it's so obvious to me.  It's like, how about you don't call him the Joker?  It's so irritating.  Oh, really?  It's like, all that shit isn't going to work.  I love the people.  Well, you know, locally, they're not going to show his mugshot in Aurora.  Well, guess what?  Everyone in Aurora saw his mugshot. 
[00:02:00]  We live in a very different world.  You know?  And using the word, the Joker, a forum is as a goof on the media.  Oh, of course I'm goofing by saying the Joker.  You hear how I'm saying it?  It's not like the, ugh, this guy.  Right, and another thing that I brought up is, why the fuck didn't they just shave his fucking head?  I agree.  The second he got into fucking jail.  So that's our policy here in this jail.  We're shaving your fucking head so he doesn't end up in court with the dumb red fucking hair.  He looks like an asshole, though. 
[00:02:30]  He really looks ridiculous with orange hair.  Eastside Dave?  Of course he does.  He looks like an asshole.  I actually like that he still has the dumb red hair.  Really?  Yeah, you shave him down.  He doesn't look as ridiculous.  Let him look stupid.  He does look stupid.  I feel bad for the public defender.  You know she doesn't want this case.  Well, she wants no part of this one.  She doesn't want any part of it.  Someone said, guess what?  Guess what you got today?  Oh.  So don't fucking hit her.  Why couldn't I get the fucking, the broad that wrote the bad checks and couldn't afford  the law?  Yeah, of course. 
[00:03:00]  She's like, oh, fuck, seriously?  I don't think there's many lawyers that actually want to defend this fucking loser.  Well, he should get a vigorous defense for the public defender.  Right.  Oh, boy.  They said, no, that's not going to be his lawyer.  His lawyer, they said, is going to be the guy who's actually the best public defender.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, you have to.  Because this way, because he's going to lose.  You can't, you can't, most you could do is save his life.  You can't do anything.  So if you don't give him a good defense, you don't want him to have anything on appeal. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, that's the lovely country we live in.  I guess we have no choice in that matter, unfortunately, but I personally would love  to see him just shot in the back of the fucking head and thrown in a dumpster.  Yeah, it'd be nice.  Period.  And I am not arguing that with anybody.  Yeah, it would be nice.  But the crazy eye, that's all fake.  Fake.  But no one in the media will be brave enough to say that.  Say, oh, he looked out of it.  He looked confused, maybe drugged. 
[00:04:00]  How about it looked like he was completely still playing this dumb fuck part and faking it?  In his stupid head.  He's the Joker.  Oh, yeah.  Ooh, look at these mysterious.  What are some of the words?  Disoriented.  Completely out of it.  Bizarre.  What's acting?  Looked scared and bizarre.  Oh, I just hope someone just beats the fuck out of him.  Just a sound prison flashing. 
[00:04:30]  Literally, that's what I want to see as a guy.  I want to see it.  He has not had one ounce of penalty.  No.  One fist fucking careening off his fucking upper lip and shattering teeth.  Smashing his face into the concrete.  Bam.  Looked dazed and sleepy.  Bizarre.  That's how I come into the show every day.  Dazed and sleepy.  Freaky.  They're calling him freaky.  Again, they're loving the word bizarre. 
[00:05:00]  Looked crazy.  No, he's acting.  He's self-acting.  He's still playing the part.  Like, oh, look at me.  Oh, I don't know.  What am I going to do next?  Look out.  Right.  I'm a wild man.  Yeesh.  Nah.  And, you know, he's getting three meals a day.  He's getting his sleep.  He's protected.  He's got a bulletproof vest on right there.  And I saw his dumb apartment building.  I bet you he's living just as well.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Not that much different.  Fuck this guy.  So enraging.  So enraging.  I really hope he just fucking...  Pursuant to CRS 18-1101, we are to enter a mandatory protection order.  Any violation of the protection order can constitute a new criminal offense and or contempt of court.  Oh, on a new criminal offense.  If you are the court, you shall not harass, molest, intimidate, retaliate against, or tackle any witness to you or victim of the acts you are charged with committing. 
[00:06:00]  You shall vacate the home of the victim, stay away from the home of the victims, and stay away from any other location the victims are likely to be found.  I hope he doesn't have the opportunity to go to any of the victims' homes.  I like these fucking legal things they have to do.  The legalese.  They put a restraining order against him from contacting the victim.  I guess you can do that from prison.  Sure, writing them letters or emails.  They do that, yeah.  These motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Look at him, closing his eyes tight. 
[00:06:30]  But what are the fucking consequences?  Like, this guy is accused of mass murder.  He did it.  I mean, there's no fucking doubt.  He looks scared, though.  Like, he looks like...  He doesn't look crazy.  No, he looks like, uh-oh, what'd I do?  He looks like he knows he's fucked.  He's going to spend the rest of his life in prison, if not the death penalty.  But I think he's still trying to, like, play it up, still.  You know, look at that.  I mean, come on.  Look at that dumb face stuff.  How punchable is that?  It's fucking...  How punchable? 
[00:07:00]  In 15 years, when all the appeals are going through, they'll interview him in prison.  He'll have a fucking...  He'll have his gray hair brushed back, and he'll be in a little prison thing, and they'll  talk about what a model prisoner he's been, and he'll talk about Jesus, and how I don't  even remember being that person, and everybody'll be like, oh, he's a great guy now, and it's  how this shit works.  And then some of the victims' families will actually forgive him.  I forgive him, and we've actually spoken in prison.  We've spoken, and I...  Because this dumb motherfucker, fucking religious person got us together. 
[00:07:30]  I reached out to his mom.  Yeah.  We had tea.  I don't know how you do any of that stuff.  I don't either.  I mean, I don't...  You know, if that's what you got to do, I'm not judging you.  Okay.  Too much time goes past, and then you fucking...  Everything gets desensitized, and...  Which, in a way, is okay when, you know, the pure emotion is out of it, and you could  look logically at a case like this.  But then too much time goes by, and people, you know...  Hey, you know what?  A son of Sam, that motherfucker, is just... 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Like, in prison, enjoying his life in prison.  He talks to people.  He has great times every day.  Most of his life has been spent in prison.  Right.  And that's his life.  And he has relationships.  He talks to people.  He enjoys his job in prison.  And this is the motherfucker that terrified New York.  Right.  This was a monster that terrified New York City.  And now, enough time went by where it's like, ah, that's David Berkowitz. 
[00:08:30]  What a great guy.  He enjoys his TV programs.  Of course.  He might even be watching Breaking Bad.  I don't know.  He might be.  I don't know if they got the cable in prison.  They might, though.  He ministers other prisoners, so he's enjoying...  He's literally enjoying his time in prison.  He did not enjoy his time on the outside.  He was an outcast.  He probably has a better life for himself because he did that.  And why?  Why should he?  Why isn't this motherfucker dead?  Well, where's all the convict justice? 
[00:09:00]  This is where this fucking fake chivalry in jail.  Oh, you don't want to do that and go to jail?  Really?  This guy just fucking murdered people in their cars having...  Where's all this fucking jail justice?  Well, I believe they protected him for many, many, many years.  You know what?  And then, like Ann said, enough time goes by, it fades away, and then that raw nerve isn't around anymore.  They become model citizens.  I think someone would do that.  Model citizens in their fucking private condo complex, what it amounts to. 
[00:09:30]  Anyone else going to point out he went with the Cesar Romero Joker, by the way?  Yes, the red hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Cesar Romero.  Wasn't it Cesar?  It was, yeah.  I just came up with that.  I didn't even fucking Google that before the show.  That's the guy, Cesar Romero.  He went with the Cesar Romero joke.  From the Batman series.  Yeah, he's the only one, I think, that had red hair.  I think the rest of them went, oh no, he had green too.  No, he had red and green.  He would change it.  Okay, he did have red, but he also had green.  Yeah, he would change it up.  Because Heath Ledger had green, right?  Yeah.  See, go to the... 
[00:10:00]  So this asshole didn't even get his hair right?  It is green.  There it's red.  Yeah, so he went back and forth.  But I remember him as having the red hair for the Joker.  Cesar Romero.  Look at that fucking idiot.  He was a good Joker, though.  Cesar Romero was a good fucking Joker.  How many of the Jokers were in the Batman, the original Batman?  Was it just him?  The series?  I think it was just him.  A TV show was just him, I believe.  Was it?  Yeah, he was a big part of the Batman TV show.  Is he dead or alive?  I would have to say dead. 
[00:10:30]  And was Frank Gorshin...  He was the Riddler.  He was the Riddler, of course.  Frank Gorshin was great.  I just saw 12 Monkeys recently.  When did he die?  94.  94?  Oh, a long time ago.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I just saw 12 Monkeys, and Frank Gorshin's in that as the lead psychiatrist in the hospital.  He's so fucking...  He was great in that movie.  He's fucking...  He was a good actor, that motherfucker.  He's dead, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was a good comic, too.  Yeah, he was funny.  He was good at doing impressions, and he just was a good... 
[00:11:00]  He was great in that movie.  Correctional officer, this stuff will drive you nuts.  But these guys know way more than we do, obviously.  Chris, give us some knowledge.  Where do you work, first of all?  I'm not going to say.  Somewhere in New York.  Yeah, no worries.  No worries.  All right.  What do you got, buddy?  All right.  The state just fucking coddles these guys.  These guys, they're fucking heroes to the other convicts.  There's no convict justice no more.  These guys, they're just... 
[00:11:30]  They're coddled.  They get starstruck.  These fucking convicts get starstruck at these people.  Well, I think you're generalizing a little too much.  What about some kind of kid-toucher?  That...  A high-profile kid-toucher in prison.  We've always heard that the other convicts, you know, would love to get at those guys.  They're all PC'd up there.  No one's touching them.  No, man.  No one's touching this guy anytime soon.  I mean, no one.  You'd have to have someone go rogue. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You'd have to have an officer or somebody go rogue.  Huh?  Then his family would sue, and then the state would have to pay.  It's all bullshit.  Right.  Oh, great.  Fucking litigation is in the way of true fucking justice.  So, we get to look at this asshole for years to come.  And I doubt they ever kill him, by the way.  Nah, I bet they don't.  We don't like killing people as a civilized society.  Yeah, unfortunately.  Except for Texas.  Let's acknowledge Texas. 
[00:12:30]  Gotta love Texas.  Let me say hi to Dennis.  Dennis, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how are you?  All right.  Hey, I spent almost five years in upstate New York there.  It was only a medium.  They were the old psych centers.  I heard of all the psychiatric patients.  I don't know what they did with them.  I guess that's what the homeless are.  But, anyways, they made that of prisons and stuff.  But I had second-degree manslaughter.  I spent almost five years up there from 92 to 97. 
[00:13:00]  And I'll tell you what, it was no fun.  They can say what they want.  And I'll tell you, if I ever had to do life, I'd tell them, hell no, give me the death penalty.  And that wasn't even a max.  Really?  Well, what happened to you?  Nah, I just, I don't know how people do it.  Every morning you're going to sink.  There's frickin' black hairs in it, the showers, the toilet.  I mean, who wants to go there?  I mean, I think...  Did you get ass-fucked? 
[00:13:30]  No, the only ones...  No one ever gets ass-fucked.  The only ones who got that were the ones who wanted it.  Oh, nice.  And somehow they didn't think they were gay.  Sam?  In fact, we were in a four-man room.  We had one guy who came in who would use a coolant lipstick.  Fellas.  And he, uh...  We had a couple boys in our dorm that didn't like homos too much.  And they said, if you don't leave, you're going to get stuck.  Hey, before we even entertain your call, what did you do? 
[00:14:00]  Uh, drink DWI manslaughter.  Oh, you were drunk driving and you killed someone?  Jesus.  Well, the guy who was, uh...  The guy who got killed, he was drinking too.  I mean, he had the same blood alcohol as me.  He had coconuts and stuff.  Wait, wait, wait.  Was he in a separate car?  I'm sorry, what?  Was he in a separate car?  Yeah.  Oh.  How did it happen?  That's how he justifies it.  Jesus.  His blood alcohol level was...  Hey, that guy's got to sleep. 
[00:14:30]  That guy's got to sleep.  That's high as mine, so...  How did it happen?  Something was going to happen to him that night.  Yeah, it was my car, his car, and a tractor trailer.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  The, uh...  I survived.  He didn't, you know.  I mean, I...  I don't remember what happened.  My fraction, my skull, a fraction dislocated my hip.  Um...  I went to, uh...  I went to the impound area and saw his car, and you could see the indentation from the  tractor trailer, but they said I caused it.  I said, well, I couldn't afford to fight it, and I knew I was wrong at some level, if not 
[00:15:00]  all levels.  So I took the plea, and, uh, took, uh, it was, uh, two and a third to seven.  At the time, you do, uh, one-third of your max, and, uh...  I went to the pro board twice, and they hit me.  They're like guys who corrupt people with knives and stuff like that out, but I couldn't  get work released or nothing.  They were tough on DWIs.  Well, you're pretty dangerous there, my friend, if you were going to do that.  Jesus.  Yeah, I haven't drank in 20 years, so I've been...  Oh. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, what do you do for a living now?  It's still pretty good.  Yeah, I'm an electrician.  All right.  You found work.  Good for you.  All right.  I'm sorry, what's that?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's one thing good about being in construction is they kind of, you  know, oh, okay, you know, they're, you know, they'll, everybody in the business can pretty  much relate.  Most of them are all...  Yeah, they're all a bunch of fucking drunken degenerates anyway.  Yep.  You know, I remember when Kenny and I went to, went to visit a prison, and they, the guy 
[00:16:00]  showed us photos of a murder that had taken place in the jail of a guy who had drunk drove  and killed, I think, a nine-year-old.  Yikes.  It was a guy who had driven drunk a lot, he had like nine convictions.  Oh, boy.  And some other convict doing life plus took a fucking, an ice pick or something and just  fucking killed him in the yard.  Wow.  Because of, because of...  It was definitely because of that, or it wasn't another beef?  This guy, they knew who he was coming in, this guy, he just fucking stabbed his neck.  Wow.  He just gouged the guy's neck.  I mean, this guy was never getting out anyway. 
[00:16:30]  He was, yeah.  He was, again, one of those triple or quadruple life guys.  Good.  Who just didn't want to see this guy around the yard.  Wow.  He just annoyed him that he was walking.  And took care of him.  Let's go to another correctional officer.  It's Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Yeah.  Hey, Chris.  I worked in numerous federal prisons around the country.  And this dude is going to get, if he gets in population, cataphiles and people who are 
[00:17:00]  girls or women, he's going to get fucked up.  Yeah, but they'll never put him in population.  Even in the special housing unit, I saw a dude get murdered for being a snitch.  And they disemboweled him.  They put his fucking intestines all over the cell.  Google it.  The dude's name was Rudy Sablon.  Dude, that's all they seem to care about in jail, is snitches. 
[00:17:30]  Like, if you snitch, they kill you.  Like, don't tell who's making wine in the toilet.  But if you murder a kid, I've heard what you're saying, but it's like so many of them  are still alive.  Yeah, but he's going to get, he's going to end up in some federal penitentiary in the  middle of the country where these dudes are doing life.  And they're going to ass rape him or they're going to kill him.  I just don't, I don't understand, you're a mass murderer. 
[00:18:00]  How many people have died?  Twelve.  We're still at twelve, right?  I think so, yeah.  And then eventually he goes to prison, then he's protected.  Well, you know, he should be a regular prisoner.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  You know, we'll do our best to try to, you know, keep everyone under control.  But why does he get special treatment after murdering twelve people?  The lawsuits.  That's crazy.  Yeah, I guess it has to do with lawsuits.  But he should be a regular prisoner.  They do have, you know, guards and correctional officers that will do their best to make sure  everybody's safe. 
[00:18:30]  But, you know, shit happens.  Sorry.  That's the life you chose when you decide to kick in that door and come back in the theater.  Yep.  It just amazes me we can't even do that shit in our society.  Yeah.  Now we take this guy and protect him.  Go above and beyond.  Huh?  If he's spitting on the COs, they may not be saying it, but he's getting,  he's getting his shit.  They're spitting in his food.  They're fucking with him back. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  A little spit in the food.  Ooh.  I understand what you're saying, Chris.  And I'm not taking a shot at you, but it's just frustrating.  I'd rather see, like Jimmy said, his teeth get knocked out because he's spitting on  correctional officers.  He'll get PC'd, protective custody, and that'll be the end of him.  And like you said, five years from now, they'll forget about him.  Of course they will.  Yeah, somebody has to get to this piece of garbage.  Thank you, buddy.  I really want to see that fucking jaw shattered. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah?  Your teeth.  I'm telling you, getting your teeth knocked out hurts.  Oh, that's got to hurt, right?  Yeah, a fucking...  Gum pain.  Gum pain.  We all can relate to gum pain.  But I'd love to see how he reacts.  How about extreme gum pain?  To two fists just careening off his face.  Like two fucking really...  Right.  Even if they're just correctional officers, because those guys are fucking brutal, man.  But we are just fucked up.  You know, why is it the guy murders 12 and then we bring him, eventually goes to prison  and then he gets protected?  Isn't prison is prison.  You should just be one of the other guys. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You know, you hire people to hopefully keep everyone in line, but, you know, good luck to  you.  We can't guarantee your safety.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I don't know why we do this shit.  Because we're a civilized society, I guess.  Are we really, in the end?  We like to think we are.  Yeah, we're not.  We're not, right?  Not even close.  We like to make believe, though.  Everyone likes to make believe.  We're better than the other countries.  So above everything.  Aren't we really?  So above everything.  Think about us. 
[00:20:30]  Well, this leads to...  This fucking guy.  It leads to...  Let's see what the Joker do now.  No, I'm just looking at this.  Very mysterious.  Look out.  What am I going to do next?  Look out.  Coke Logic and others are saying, thank you for saying Holmes is faking.  Yeah.  It's obvious to me.  I don't know.  I could be wrong.  But, you know, this is all just bullshit. 
[00:21:00]  He's continuing his crap.  You could absolutely see that he's scared.  But through that, he's still trying to play the role of the Joker.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Opie.  What'd I do?  If you don't think this is the greatest country in the world, then you can get out.  All right.  What happened?  I would ask that guy, how many countries has he been to, to see if our country is the  greatest?  Because I hate people like that.  Because we don't know if this is the greatest country in the world.  World travelers would know. 
[00:21:30]  I went to Greece once and Turkey for a day.  I don't know.  I still don't know if this is the greatest country.  That's an honest statement.  Yeah.  You can just make believe in your own head.  That's great.  But I have no idea if this is the greatest country.  I haven't been around to enough places to know.  One of my greatest satisfactions is that Jonathan travels everywhere, and I'm slowly getting  him to understand how many shitholes there are out there.  Like, I've turned him into an angry driver.  He's a vicious driver now.  He used to be the nicest guy, but he's miserable now.  Right.  And I've started to point out these countries, and I'm like, they're savages. 
[00:22:00]  And he's like, yeah.  They are.  They are.  They are.  They are.  I love beating him down.  Oh, shit.  You're ruining him.  I really am ruining this wide-eyed, world-traveling, fun guy.  I'm a cancer.  Why would you do that to him?  Let him be.  No, I love spoiling it.  A lot of prisoners or ex-prisoners calling in.  I've been to prison.  He's not going to have anything done to him.  We pretty much know that, right?  We all know that. 
[00:22:30]  But are they saying because of the other convicts or because they'll be protected?  He's going to be protected.  He's not even going to be in general pop, as they say.  They have a unit in San Quentin, which we saw.  We couldn't go into it, but that's where Sirhan Sirhan is.  That's where Scott Peterson is.  That's where a whole bunch of them are.  Manson.  They get special treatment for having an over-the-top crime.  A high-profile case.  A high-profile case.  That's insane to me.  It really is.  Let's start there.  How about we just start there? 
[00:23:00]  How about the crazy joker who says he doesn't want to be in protective custody?  Right.  How about the crazy joker who just goes, no, I'm crazy.  I want to interact with people.  Yes.  I'm nuts.  If he sucks the joker, you know what would happen?  He'd get into general population, and he'd get his cronies.  Yeah.  That's where you get your cronies for the big breakout.  So you can do another cronies.  And then once you break out, you have your cronies.  Now you have your team with you.  Right.  Your team of underlings.  Cronies and henchmen.  And then Mayor Bloomberg's going to have to put the bat signal on New York City.  Right.  The bat signal.  And it's just a big thing because he's the joker. 
[00:23:30]  Well, there won't be a bat signal.  It'll just be a guy in a stall.  That's what fucking Bloomberg will send up.  Ah, Bloomberg.  Fuck it.  A big rainbow across the sky.  That fruit.  I guess I got to leave America.  Yeah, huh?  I like America.  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  Like it or lump it.  I don't like being just blind.  Love it or leave it.  Blind to things.  Remember, that's what the construction workers used to say to the hippies.  Really?  America, love it or leave it.  And then they'd wrap their heads in with a fucking aggressive wrench. 
[00:24:00]  I think America has a lot of problems.  Yeah.  There's a people problem.  A people problem?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean?  Well, there's a lot of people say there's a gun problem, a violence problem.  It's a people problem.  There's fucking, there's just crazy people that are coddled.  I was reading an article on China yesterday.  And I'll tell you this much.  I don't have to be to China to know we're a better country than China. 
[00:24:30]  I'll tell you that much.  Article, you know, they have that whole you can only have one kid thing.  Yeah, they don't put up with shenanigans.  And they're trying to appeal that.  They're trying to get rid of that.  They're not having much luck.  But this lady tells her story.  She was eight months pregnant.  And she was just taken and brought to the hospital.  And then they inject this drug.  And then she goes into early labor and delivers a dead kid.  Yeah.  That's how serious they are about the one kid policy. 
[00:25:00]  The forced abortion recently, right?  That was a big story.  It was in the paper yesterday.  And we do business with this country.  That's insane.  Because I think if you do have more than one child, they do penalize you, right?  They do.  They don't necessarily take your kid away.  But I think they hit you with some heavy fines or something, right?  They got a billion.  I mean, China's a weird place, though.  They're over a billion.  There's so many.  Like, we have...  There's like three times as many of them or more than there is American.  How are they able to get that many people?  They just...  They've been around a lot longer. 
[00:25:30]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, they've been around a long time.  Asians are soldiers.  Like, they are...  They look at the good of the state.  Like, you ever look at Asians in this country?  A lot of times, spatially, they're happy standing a quarter inch from you.  Like, because they have less of a space obsession than Americans, because they're used to...  The ones who are from China, they're used to being crammed together.  A lot of those...  Like, the Japanese and Chinese, they're very much...  They're more comfortable working for the greater good, as it were, than Americans are.  New Year's Eve and Times Square, they probably feel like they're... 
[00:26:00]  They got plenty of room.  Oh, this is very roomy.  Yeah.  Roomy.  But that story I read yesterday was horrific.  And then the men...  I'm trying to remember the exact details, but the men that injected her all...  You know, magically disappeared, and there she's left in the hospital.  And, you know, after a few hours of labor, she delivers a dead blue kid.  Wow.  Amazing.  That's their country.  That's their...  I know we're better than that, at least. 
[00:26:30]  And, you know, the leaders go over there and do their little bowing and to talk business and...  Oh, and the reason...  Hypocrites.  And this is interesting.  The reason they want to get rid of the one-kid policy is because their country is aging, obviously.  And they feel like they don't have...  It's called Asian.  They're aging.  Oh, aging.  They feel...  They're aging!  They feel like...  That's a pop, I would say it.  In the coming years, they're not going to have a lot of young people for that cheap labor shit. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  So they're worried about that.  They're like, this could hurt us, so maybe we should allow people to have more than one kid.  Mmm.  And that's the only reason they're thinking about it.  It's like one of those games where you've got to get the population and build the houses and the factories and all that.  Right.  And then you realize it's like, oh, shit, I shut down production on people.  Yep.  Oh, man, I'm running out of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to prove something to everybody.  Sam, just read the first paragraph, maybe the second, and you don't have to read the two-page article.  Go ahead.  Okay. 
[00:27:30]  Pan Chun Yan was grabbed from her grocery store.  Fucking...  It's spicy, though.  When I get it, where I get it.  What are you proving that Sam has a nice reading voice?  Because I'll say it.  He does.  Read on, baby.  Was grabbed from her grocery store when she was almost eight months pregnant with her third child.  Men working for a local official locked her up with two other women and four days later brought her to a hospital  and forced her to put her thumbprint on a document saying she had agreed to an abortion. 
[00:28:00]  A nurse injected her with a drug.  Quote, after I got the shot, all the thugs disappeared, Ms. Pan, 31, said in a telephone interview from her home  in the southeastern province of Fujian.  My family was with me again.  I cried and hoped the baby would survive.  I guess we have to do one more sentence.  But after hours of labor, the baby was born dead.  Black and blue all over.  There you go.  Caught right. 
[00:28:30]  You don't even need the rest of the article, which is another page and a half.  Caught right.  There you go.  This guy...  Oh, no, this lady just got back from China.  Donna, what's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  First of all, I love you guys.  And second of all...  Get in line, Donna.  Everyone does.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  We have enough love for everyone.  I just got back from a two-week trip to China and Japan.  So I just wanted to let you know that as far as the population control, 
[00:29:00]  if you are born of a parent, of one-child parents, you are allowed to have two children now.  Oh.  In other words, if one child marries another one-child family, you can have two children.  Because the bottom line is, if they keep doing this, they won't have enough people to take care of their elderly.  So now you can actually have two children without being killed.  A lot of people asking if this is Jimmy's mom. 
[00:29:30]  Were they doing that to be awful, or was it like a legitimate population concern?  Because that's a billion people.  That's a lot of people, then.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of people there.  But I'll tell you something.  China is light years ahead of us.  They are building buildings, thousands and thousands of buildings.  In years, in six years, they built about 2,000 skyscrapers.  And they are just way ahead of us. 
[00:30:00]  You know why?  Because it's not expensive.  Everything we do in America, or you'd see it right here in New York City, everything is so ridiculously expensive.  They don't take on a lot of new projects.  Do you know a skyscraper there costs $1.75 to construct?  It's made out of, like, sticks and rolling paper.  I got $10 on me right now.  I can get five skyscrapers.  Well, four taxes.  It's true, but their infrastructure is unbelievable.  What about their infrastructure? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, shit.  You fucking Far East, baby.  Double chopsticks.  But they are really light years ahead of us.  And they are just growing and growing and growing.  And they are going to take over this world.  Trust me.  Yeah.  China is unbelievable.  Well, maybe we should start doing that cheap labor shit.  Yep.  Because we're not better than everyone else.  Let's do it, man.  Well, if you come back to America and you see the bridges that are falling apart and the tunnels that are falling apart and you see that they're building brand new highways, you know, by the hour, it's just incredible. 
[00:31:00]  That drives me insane.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  I've been living in and out of New York pretty much my entire life.  I go do radio a couple of years here and there, but I always come back.  To see our shit just rotting away in front of our eyes and we can't figure it out as a city, as a country, drives me nuts.  They just patch it up just enough so we can continue driving over shitty roads. 
[00:31:30]  And in the last five years, they built 16 tunnels and bridges over, let's say, what, like our Hudson River?  Right.  We should move there.  16, and we are still driving through the hollow tunnel that's falling apart.  And we'll debate building another tunnel for another 10 years.  When it's so obvious that New York City needs more tunnels, at least tunnels, it's unbelievable we can't figure this out.  We're supposed to be this great country, this great city. 
[00:32:00]  Well, the reason they can do that and we can't is because they...  Cheap labor.  Cheap labor.  It's all for the state.  Like, everything you do, even the way you reproduce, is for the state.  They live in tiny places, in most cases.  Like, these fucking horrible little boxy apartments.  Right.  Like, their infrastructure is good because the workers have no say.  Right.  So they do stuff...  Like, we could get more tunnels built if they said, okay, nobody's making more than $3 an hour.  Yeah.  And we're working around the clock, we're fuck noise, we're doing it, we would have the same thing. 
[00:32:30]  So they're light years ahead of us in that way, but the price they pay is they have no individual say in a lot of what they do.  I understand that part of the argument, obviously.  And if we ignored nine-tenths of our nation and concentrated on just building up one-tenth of it  and left the other nine-tenths of impoverished rural farm areas with people living in mud houses...  Is that what happens over there?  Yeah, it's fucking amazing.  So I shouldn't be four sweatshops anytime soon?  Well...  I'm sure you should. 
[00:33:00]  But you know what?  I mean, logically, and it goes with most things, somewhere in between would work for us.  Yeah.  Thank you, Donna, for the knowledge.  I love you guys.  Thanks, Donna.  Okay, bye.  All right.  She loves us.  Yeah.  That voice is right out of fucking Long Island or Jersey.  Couldn't tell.  Sound a little Jersey.  China's the dirtiest place in the world.  Just got back two weeks ago.  The beauty of the show.  Donna is romanticizing China. 
[00:33:30]  Let's see what Ken has to say, and then we'll move on.  Ken in Texas.  Hi!  Hey.  Wrong camera.  I just got back.  I'm doing business with them, and they...  Yeah, they're building stuff, but they don't use the same progress of our steel and stuff  we put in it.  They'll build stuff, and it'll be falling apart.  It'll look like it's 20 years old, and it's only two years old.  Ah, see?  Not some quality shit.  Right.  I hear you.  I mean, their standards is unbelievable trying to make them understand why it costs so much 
[00:34:00]  to build it here, because our safety and our regulations and codes, they just don't  have them.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no safety codes or anything.  They don't give a shit.  Where's the Taipan Tower?  Is that China, or is that Taiwan?  Or Taipei Tower.  Taipei.  T-A-P-A-I, I think.  I don't think that's China.  No, you might be Taiwan.  No, no. 
[00:34:30]  That's Taiwan.  Where is that, Sam?  That tower's ridiculous.  Yeah, no, we were there.  We saw, like, crawlers, like, the big digging crawlers.  They had two of them sitting on top of a building, and they were working it down, just demolishing  it from the top down.  Wow.  I would love to see that.  Yeah.  There's no way in hell you'd be able to get somebody in America to sit on top of that.  I mean...  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Thank y'all.  All right.  Love it. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, we just take...  We used to build shit.  Anne said it over the years.  Yeah.  We used to be really good at building shit.  Yeah.  And I mean all sorts of shit.  All sorts of cool projects.  Now?  Now what?  When was the last time you saw a cool project being built?  Yeah.  When our parents were growing up, they got to see a lot of cool shit being built right  in front of their eyes.  Yeah.  Bridges and whatnot.  Big dams.  I guess now we got this Freedom Tower, which I hate to name it.  It took forever.  That's my point.  It's the only thing.  I mean, it's a very... 
[00:35:30]  It took knocking down two of them.  Right, right.  To fucking build it.  But you know how embarrassing it is that the 10-year anniversary, they still didn't have  a complete building?  You know, we did our best with that whole celebration, but the fact is, at the very least, as a country  and as a city, a great city, that thing should have been built for the 10-year anniversary.  I know, right.  10 years, please.  All that red tape.  But no, the reason why...  I don't want to hear the reasons.  I know, people.  We're better than that.  Everyone will have reasons.  As a society, supposedly.  As a society!  I wonder about that, though. 
[00:36:00]  Are we?  Yeah.  But there you go.  The Joker made his first court appearance.  He is such a hateable guy.  Yeah.  Like, what a hateable motherfucker, man.  Just fucking kill him already.  Could someone just kill him?  That would be very satisfying for a lot of people.  I don't think anyone's really going to be upset.  I don't think anyone's really going to mind. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe the mother, but she'll get over it.  Yeah, the mother, you know.  You know the Navy SEALs, those guys that took out Osama?  Yeah.  Can they do a little thing?  Do a little thing.  Can they do a little operation there?  Yeah.  Can they get him while he's being transported or peeking out his window?  One right between his eyes.  Right between the eyes.  I saw him the other day.  I saw Ira, too.  He's almost ready to come back on the show.  He was by the bank of elevators saying, hello. 
[00:37:00]  When do you come back on the show?  Never.  Never.  He is a funny dude.  He's hilarious.  I asked him again because that's my thing.  I love asking him because I love hearing the never.  He goes, I swear.  He said this last week.  He goes, how about today?  How about today?  And then I go, all right.  He goes, well, maybe not.  He went from how about today to maybe not.  He goes, never.  How about today?  And then maybe not.  He's up to me. 
[00:37:30]  How about today, though?  That's good.  That is pretty good.  He's thinking about it.  I've heard it had something to do with not Jay Thomas being territorial, but with...  There was a few things going on.  Yeah, there was something else going on that wasn't anybody here.  We treat Ira nice.  Yeah.  We really treat him nice.  He asked me about Irene.  He goes, you should have Irene back.  Oh, that's what he told me.  I'm like, she's no good without you.  Yeah.  He goes, oh.  Oh.  He's very logical.  Yeah.  He knows every radio guy. 
[00:38:00]  You see who's coming down the hall.  Oh, does he?  And then he gives them the...  He gives their whole resume.  Yeah.  He started W-O-R doing traffic.  Didn't he hate Bobo?  Oh, yeah.  He was doing it in the elevator.  Irak, it's been way too long.  Do we have an Ira clip for the newer listeners?  Ira.  Never.  He loves talking about the weather, but then we got all the stuff out of him. 
[00:38:30]  Because I was asking him about the weather, too.  I was like, what's it look like today, Ira?  It's going to be very hot and humid, but under clear blue skies.  I love talking like Ira.  He's hilarious.  It really is hard not to talk like Ira.  Yes, it's just fun to do, right?  I just want him to announce everything in my life.  Jim's going to come now.  How great would that be to be fucking with Ira in that already?  Eat her ass. 
[00:39:00]  Look at him, man.  He's stimulating the cliton.  He's going to make you cum.  Fucking Ira.  Yeah, we'll try to find an Ira clip for everybody.  Something short and nice.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, we've got to talk about the iced tea thing.  Ice cure.  And Minka Kelly.  And who?  Minka Kelly.  What'd she do?  There's a sex tape of hers, an older one that's being shot. 
[00:39:30]  I would love to buy it.  Oh, she's the one that might have been 17 or 18 at the time.  She's sexy, man.  She's pretty sexy.  32, I believe.  God.  Who's the great secret keeper that held that for 15 years?  They probably didn't know what they had.  The whole time she's dating Jeter?  Yeah.  That's when it was worth money.  Rumors about the Jeter, by the way.  What are the rumors?  What are those rumors?  Are they...  I've never heard that.  That one?  No way. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't say anything.  Well, is this the rumor?  Oh.  I didn't say anything.  All right.  What's the rumor, Sam?  I don't know.  He's all man.  He's all man.  And we got to talk about what the Yankees did yesterday with Ichiro.  Ichiro.  He's good, right?  He used to be good.  Suzuki.  I don't know why the Yankees would pick him up.  His numbers have dropped drastically.  That's why they'd pick him up.  There's nothing...  The Yankees love doing that, right?  They love a slugger whose best years were six years ago. 
[00:40:30]  You know, New York in general loves doing that.  All their sports teams.  We get Camby and fucking a drunk driving guy.  Holy shit.  I can't remember his name.  Look down.  Please help me out.  Dwayne Martin?  Kidd?  Yeah, thank you.  Chasing Kidd, of course.  Thank you, Ken.  Wait, past their prime.  New York teams love getting these guys past their prime.  Past their prime.  Ichiro has...  His numbers are down significantly from last year.  Did they get him cheap at least?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, they got him cheap?  On the cheap?  So they have nothing to lose, and they're thinking he might have a little, as they like to say,  a little more gas in the tank.  A resident baseball expert.  Gazeball expert.  Dr. K!  Dr. K!  They got him for his...  Shut up, Sam.  They got him for his speed, not for his bet.  How long has he been playing?  How long has he been?  He's been in the majors for 11, but he played in Japan before that.  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah, that doesn't count, really. 
[00:41:30]  No one's going to acknowledge his Japan.  He's in the Japanese Hall of Fame.  That's good for him, but we don't even know.  So it's Godzilla.  Name one guy in the Japanese Hall of Fame.  Ichiro Suzuki.  Hideki Arabo.  Arabo, you think?  Yeah.  Well, if we're doing...  If guys who've hung themselves have to play for the Yankees.  But, I mean, he's one of the greatest hitters of all time, but...  Is he?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  If you combine his hits in Japan with the hits that he has in the majors,  he's a couple hundred away from Pete Rose.  In Japan, the hand could be used like a knife. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, but that's against Japanese pitchers.  That's true.  Well, he's got like 2,500 hits in the majors in 11 years.  Is that good?  That's incredible.  Wow.  He's got 10 years of over 200 hits.  He's one of those dumb slap hitters.  Yeah.  And he fucking hates slap hitters.  Rod Carew was the most boring baseball player ever.  80 home runs in 18 years or something.  Yeah, good for him.  Good for him.  He had 10,000 singles and four doubles in his career.  In 11 years.  Huh?  99.  Yeah, this guy.  Was he a leadoff guy? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  He has 99 homers in 11 years?  Yeah, he's not a home run hitter.  I love those guys.  Like, Rod Carew was my favorite for a long time, even though I was a Yankee fan.  Because I just love this little slap hit.  He was just one of those guys who was always on base.  Is he in the Hall of Fame, Rod Carew?  He has to be.  I just hated how he played.  Yeah.  It was boring.  He had that weird...  Could you look up Rod Carew?  He had a weird, like...  He had loose...  He had loose...  Loose wrist when he was batting.  Loosey, goosey wrist.  Yeah.  And he would just slap it. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  This was one of those guys.  His bat was always ready.  But, I mean, that is pretty impressive to slap at a major league fastball.  I don't know how you do that.  Yeah.  That's a...  Rad Carew.  That's a reaction time.  Guys that go the other way well...  Like, Jeter is a great go-the-other-way hitter.  Which is, if you're late on a fastball, you're going to go the other way when you hit it.  But Jeter does it on purpose.  Like, he's a guy that will see a low outside pitcher and go the other way with it.  And fucking...  But he's swinging.  You're hitting to right field.  But he's swinging hard.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Look at his video.  Let me see.  It's just fucking...  How did we watch baseball back then?  No.  I mean...  The tape is...  It's just terrible.  Isn't that great?  Isn't that Bill Boggs?  It does.  It's Nightline.  Ted Koppel.  Ted Koppel.  Yes, it is, Gregory!  TV provides a close work at Carew.  At Carew.  In this decade, Rob Carew's success of hitting a baseball that sails, slides, sinks, or bends  by at 80 miles an hour has been unparalleled five times. 
[00:44:00]  He has won his lead batting championship.  You've got a weird stance, Rob.  It's only by baseball immortals named Cobb, Wagner, Hornsby, Musial, and Williams.  But in his 11 seasons with the Minnesota Twins, Carew has played far from big lights, big fanfares,  and big dollars.  Sometimes reported lesser talents in larger cities.  Yeah, before the fucking Angels.  Despite the five batting titles and ten All-Star nominations, he has never been voted most  valuable player, and he's never played in a World Series that would allow him to display  his considerable talents to a national audience. 
[00:44:30]  Nonetheless, in the peace and quiet of Minnesota, far from his birthplace in Panama, or the northern  streets of New York City where he was raised, Rod Carew has become baseball's best batsman,  and in 1977, he may be about to make his most lasting mark on the game by hitting 400.  I don't really try to do things that I'm not capable of doing.  And, you know, I know my capabilities and how far I can go and what I can do with that.  That fucker was always getting this.  No one hit fucking irritating singles. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, oh, it's 0-2.  It's a fucking slap between the shortstop and third baseman.  I'm a sucker.  Everybody knows it.  Not only was it a single, it didn't even come to you.  You had to chase it somewhere because it was just fucking knuckleballed its way into the  outfield.  Dude, fuck.  He just hit it where they weren't.  Right.  Like, it was a real skill.  Good for him.  I mean...  If he hit it towards anybody, they could have barehanded it.  Yeah.  But he hit it where they weren't, always. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Rod Carew.  And you forget, yeah, I mean, unless you'd played in the World Series, no one saw you  nationally, really.  That's really fucked up.  You'd get a highlight here and there, maybe, on...  This week in baseball.  ...wide world of sports.  I don't know what the fuck it was back then.  You couldn't watch games that weren't part of your city's fucking team.  And there was no interleague play.  I do forget that you couldn't see a guy like Carew play.  He went with the Angels, though, eventually.  And that's, I think, where I kind of saw him.  We really do take for granted what was going on these days with the television and...  You forget. 
[00:46:00]  ...media.  You've seen a lot of changes, huh?  The amazing amount of information that can pour into your fucking head.  I just said Rod Carew, and 30 seconds later, we were watching Rod...  From 1977.  I was Googling somebody yesterday, and I'm like, back 20 years ago, it's like, what's  that?  Tranny's.  No, I don't need to Google them.  I'm looking up on my phone.  Just go back over our past texts.  But I was Googling, and I'm like, what if I wanted to see what a girl looked like 20 years...  Like, you have to go to the phone book, and there was no way to cross-reference. 
[00:46:30]  It was a fucking nightmare.  We're fucked up.  Yeah.  Now it's just, you think of something, and you're like, hey, I want to check that out.  Boom.  You check it out.  I hate people who hate technology.  Like, I don't like with the new phones.  What?  You don't like information right there?  It was a lot simpler.  I don't even have one of those phones.  I have a jitterbug.  Yeah, good for you.  Yeah.  Great.  My brother was showing me, I was out in Southall, way out east, where you get to see the stars.  Because there's no city lights.  Right.  You see so many more stars when you go out east. 
[00:47:00]  And he has an app on his phone where he just puts it...  Have you seen the star app yet?  Yep.  You put it up at the sky, and it fucking shows you exactly.  I'm late to the party there, man.  Do it with an iPad, too, and it's a lot bigger.  I am late to the party, but he showed me.  I'm like, I was out of my mind.  We were having a little illegal campfire in his backyard.  Okay, the moon.  And I'm just putting up his iPhone, just checking out stars.  Where the planets are.  And it tells me exactly what the stars are or everything.  It's amazing.  Would you have to have location services on?  Yeah, because it probably uses GPS and tells you exactly where you're fucking looking. 
[00:47:30]  It's exactly where you're looking.  It's not guessing or sort of this is like...  It knows exactly where you're pointing it in the sky, and it just...  And it moves with the phone.  It's fucked up.  Pretty cool.  Pretty cool indeed.  I liked it.  It is amazing what the fuck is out there right now.  It really is.  And we're all going to be dead before it gets good.  So the less we lose our individuality...  This is the trade-off.  And our personality becomes...  We're all moving towards bland.  The crazy is coming down, and the mediocre is coming...  We're all moving towards bland, and one even line of a species. 
[00:48:00]  I completely agree with you.  That's what we're doing.  But it's a sign of evolving.  One Mylar suit style for everybody.  Dude, because the need...  I've always thought, even being funny or being quirky, all these personality traits will eventually go away.  Because they serve a need.  It's a good dopamine release.  If you make someone laugh, it's like this feeling, or it gives you this feeling to do it.  We're all going to get these feelings through whether it's medication or stuff.  But we're not going to need this other stuff to make us feel good. 
[00:48:30]  I don't like Jimmy's future.  I don't like it.  That's why I think it's going to be bland, because I think that we're all going to have our stuff...  Evolution will remove the need to have any of that stuff, because we'll be getting it artificially and faster.  I think it's going to be quite boring.  But then they won't even know any better, so...  It'll just be their life.  It's going to be like WALL-E.  It'll just be their life, yeah.  It will be boring, but you'll also know everything.  We'll all be tied into the same fucking thoughts.  But if you know everything, but everyone else knows everything, who gives a fuck? 
[00:49:00]  Who gives a fuck in the end?  How do you stand out as an individual?  You don't.  The individuality is...  No, I understand that.  And that's really scary.  But like...  How do you get laid?  That's all I want to know.  But even that...  What happens?  Even the idea of getting laid won't be necessary, because fucking...  We're not going to be...  What do you think?  We'd have to reproduce the same way forever?  And I think everyone starts really looking more the same, too.  Yeah, I agree.  You go...  Fast forward a few hundred years.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  With the advances they're making.  I mean, the body type itself will be probably very similar and, you know, not much different.  Well, genetic engineering, however you say it, is going to be...  They're going to weed out disease and sickness and all that stuff.  But then we'll start moving forward as a planet.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, fucking...  Yeah, I think so.  A thousand years from now, Earth will be like one giant fucking...  In the year 2525, if man is still alive.  Oh, my God.  That's right around the corner, isn't it?  I know.  Holy shit.  When did that song...  We'll all have one big hat we'll share. 
[00:50:00]  What was the other song?  Never mind.  In the year 35...  All right.  God, they just keep going on and on.  In the year 5555...  I was thinking 2025.  Never mind.  Yeah.  I forgot about that song.  2525 was like fucking Star Trek time.  Yeah.  I think, right?  Yeah.  And hopefully boys won't need apnea masks that are...  Thank you, by the way.  Somebody sent me apnea masks from this company.  Really?  They're trying new masks.  How many do you now have in your house?  About nine or ten. 
[00:50:30]  God.  More than that if you count small and medium because he sent me a...  Wow.  Dude, it's just fucking hard.  Yeah.  The only one that's really worked at all, and even that is very rare, is this hybrid I  have which goes over my mouth and these two little things go up in my nose.  Oh, my God.  So it's not covering my nose.  Whoa.  It's actually the more comfortable.  Yeah.  But I need such a high pressure that I fucking...  I wake up and it's going...  Boom.  Boom.  Like when you grab a balloon and pull the end of the rubber and it goes... 
[00:51:00]  Except it's my life force.  Hey, baby.  Sucks, dude.  All right.  Why don't we...  Yeah.  Let's eat.  Why don't we eat?  This is what we're going to do.  We've got to talk about Mayor Bloomberg.  Another thing that no one else in the media will point out, we will for you.  I don't understand these people.  What do they do with their time on TV?  Mayor!  He's threatening something.  We'll wait for it after the break.  But he's threatening something that will never happen. 
[00:51:30]  But no one will say that.  And also, there was something else.  The ice care.  Ice care.  Oh, Penn State.  And the shock of the people that go to Penn State when the ruling went down yesterday.  There's a great picture of the paper that made me howl.  But I do now feel bad for anyone that is at Penn State now because they had nothing to do with the controversy.  We could get into that as well.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  It's the OPN Entry Show. 
[00:52:00]  Well, East Coast girls are hip.  I really dig those styles they wear.  And the Southern girls...  What's going on?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I don't know.  Beach Boys.  Why you rock?  Oh, Sam's favorite group.  This song is 47 years old.  Nice.  But there's more important things happening.  What's going on?  Jimmy?  I'm just trying to get... 
[00:52:30]  I asked...  I wanted Kenny to, you know...  Like, I want to get my second half of my breakfast.  And we, of course, had to go through EROC, so I just asked the intern myself.  Uh-oh.  Are you allowed to ask the intern yourself?  I wrote a call.  I almost...  How about as a show, we start asking the interns ourselves?  I almost...  You guys aren't allowed to.  Yeah, I know, but I almost wish they would tell us to.  But Kenny's not allowed to.  How about we tell Kenny that he's now allowed to tell us?  Because Kenny makes it up.  He's doing it on our behalf.  Kenny knows how to do this shit. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, boy.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  Oh, boy.  You all right?  Oh, boy.  Things good with you?  Look how timid.  Where's the banana?  He screwed us up a lot.  Huh?  Oh, shit.  It's on his way.  It's on his way from where?  From Colombia.  Oh, you couldn't carry them?  Where they grow bananas.  I have no idea.  Panama?  What?  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  No banana.  Wait, what happened?  He couldn't carry the bananas.  Yes, we have no bananas.  We have no bananas for Jim.  It's a fucking coffee in one hand. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, man.  He couldn't carry the banana with what?  He couldn't carry the banana.  Wait, what?  He had cottage cheese and a coffee.  He had cottage cheese.  All right.  Hold on to the people out there.  Hold on.  There's a banana next to the cottage.  Hold on.  I want to break this down.  All Jimmy wanted was a cup of coffee, a little thing of cottage cheese, and a banana, and  the guy brought the coffee and the cottage cheese, but not the banana.  Jimmy said, where's the banana?  And he said, I couldn't carry it all.  He's making a separate trip back to the...  For the banana.  He went the wrong way wherever he went.  Oh, no.  What if it's a giant banana that he's got to carry with two hands? 
[00:54:00]  Like a body.  You see him dragging it out like he just shoveled his wife.  Now he's coming.  And you've got to understand, to the people out there, the hallway's really long.  He's now on his way back with the banana.  So he took two trips to bring Jimmy coffee.  Because he's the same one who you guys have complained about being on the phones and who  didn't get your milk right yesterday or the day before.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Here comes the banana.  Oh, my God.  Here's your banana, Jimmy. 
[00:54:30]  It's okay.  There you go.  Just put it right there.  No, no.  Here.  Just hand it to me there.  There you go.  Thanks.  That's like, see, that's how he would have carried it.  Sir, I don't know your name.  We're confused that you couldn't bring the coffee, the cottage cheese, and the banana  in one trip.  I just didn't want to drop it all.  That's all.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that was it.  I thought you were doing a thing like when you've got to take the bag of feed, the chicken,  and the wolf across the river in a boat.  But you can only take one at a time.  And you've got to first take the feed.  But in his defense, not overlooked, he had a spoon and a napkin also, in his defense. 
[00:55:00]  You're kidding, right?  Kenny, you're starting trouble.  Are you kidding?  He's kidding, right?  I think he is.  What have you ever heard Kenny say in his defense and mean to do that?  Yeah, that's right.  Right, right.  How you doing there?  Oh, no.  Doing all right?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  All right.  You're enjoying your time here?  Careful.  How long have you been an intern with us?  Since the beginning in May.  Oh.  Wow, really?  You know what he had to do?  What? 
[00:55:30]  He had to shadow the Ron and Fez interns so he could figure out how to intern right.  Ooh.  No, that happens.  Yeah, it's not good, though, because Ron and Fez interns started at the same time as our interns.  Oh, I see.  What happened?  I don't know.  Did you hit a little slow thing?  It was the phones.  Did you need, like, the Sylvan Institute for interning?  No.  No, E-Rock wanted me to watch them screen the phones, because I kept screening the phones.  What were you doing with the phones?  How were you screwing up?  Were they talking to the raw end?  No, I would just mishear things or just mistype things. 
[00:56:00]  What?  You were panicking.  Yeah.  What would you mishear?  Names.  I would just think they would say something else, or I'd just type something wrong.  Oh, boy.  You hear voices.  Great.  Oh, boy.  That's a hearing voices thing.  Red flag.  Red flag.  Red flag.  What's changed all that now?  I'm just getting more confident.  I guess.  Was it a lack of confidence that was causing you to hear the names wrong?  I believe so, yeah.  Like somebody would say, hi, I'm Pete.  Hold on, Mary.  You'd just lose your mind. 
[00:56:30]  Anticipating a screw up, and it would freak you out.  But you can never say you're gaining more confidence, I guess.  That makes people think maybe you're not gaining more confidence.  How old a lad are you?  I'm 22.  Oh, see.  He's wet behind the ears, as they say.  Is he?  My 20 is wet behind the ears.  Ah, look at Sam.  He's giving you shit right there.  Why aren't you confident?  I just never really had any.  Oh, no.  But it's getting better.  Were you bullied?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Who bullied you?  Oh, I was bullied throughout middle school.  Aw.  We all were.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Why?  Middle school.  So don't worry about that.  I was just a scrawny kid.  Oh, boy.  You know, I didn't play, like, football, or I didn't wrestle, and those are the two big  things that my...  But isn't there...  I mean, everybody that doesn't play football or wrestle or baseball or anything, they don't  always get bullied.  You must have been doing something.  Were you a little asshole?  No, I was just a really shy kid and very quiet, and I wouldn't fight back.  You got beat up?  A little bit.  Oh, man.  You are a ticking fucking time bomb.  You don't have any fucking red hair dye, do you? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  So, now, what broke you out of your shell?  What's breaking you out of your shell?  Finally getting out of my house, going to college, living on my own, realizing I can  do it by myself without someone coddling me.  It's like one of those retard movies where they put him on the bus, and he learns how  to make his way back home.  It's like Rosie.  Well, I wouldn't phrase it like that for young Connor.  I mean, there might be a better way to phrase that, which helps his confidence more.  All right.  Sorry.  You're not like a retard movie.  Yeah, let's bring this kid up for once.  How about we bring one kid up?  Yeah.  That's a nice coming-of-age story. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's bring him up instead of knocking him down.  A young Connor who's making different trips for, you know, you might want to work on  the, I could see if I was ordering, I'd like, you know, two baseball bats and fucking some  plutonium.  You might want to make separate trips.  But, you know, the whole banana, the whole banana cottage cheese combo can work in one hand.  So, um, do you have a girlfriend?  Uh, no.  Oh, boy.  Have you ever?  Yeah.  You've had, and what was your longest relationship?  About a year.  Ooh, what happened?  Just, um, I don't know. 
[00:58:30]  It just changed.  Oh.  Just didn't see eye to eye anymore and just thought it'd be best to split it.  She got tall.  Not right.  Right.  Did you change or did she?  I think it was a mixture of both.  Oh, boy.  But mostly her.  Oh, boy.  She found another guy.  Yeah, exactly.  Pretty much.  She still wanted to date her.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  She started hanging out with this one guy.  Oh.  Just friends.  It's okay.  Oh, yeah.  Just stop caring.  Oh, shut up.  Don't be so insecure.  He's just a friend.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  I've seen that shit.  Fucking bitches.  Right?  Yeah.  And were you heartbroken? 
[00:59:00]  Not really.  No?  No.  How'd she tell you she wanted to break up?  Oh, no.  I broke up.  Oh, you did?  Oh.  Good man.  Because she was seeing the other guy.  Because she was seeing someone else.  Yeah, I showed her.  But I'm not going to date you anymore.  Oh, God.  Was he white?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Her breath was fishy one too many times, right?  Oh.  I hear you.  I don't want to kiss him after that.  Wow.  So what happened?  When was the last relationship you had?  And the last relationship I had ended in February.  What was the problem there?  What happened? 
[00:59:30]  That was the relationship.  Oh, okay.  And you've just, have you been trying to find another girl?  You just can't?  Or what happened?  Um, just hanging out, really.  Yeah?  Nothing really?  Coming across your transom?  Nah.  No?  No.  You sound like Don Wicklin.  What?  Yeah, he does a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  So what brought you to the Opie and Anthony show?  I've been listening to you guys since Free FM.  Oh.  So.  Wow, that's a long time.  I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that.  I know.  It's usually any W.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Free FM was such a fucking, ugh.  You didn't like it?  Free FM.  Wait, which one was Free FM?  That was before K-Rock.  K-Rock.  Oh, it was?  Free FM.  I lost for FM.  Yeah, free for what?  Free to do nothing.  Exactly.  Well, it was, that was their way of taking on satellite radio, but they brought the satellite  radio guys.  Right.  This is how fucked up our lives and careers have been.  They brought the satellite guys over to FM radio, and they called it Free FM, meaning  we're taking on satellite radio. 
[01:00:30]  Our shit's free.  And we're free.  But you brought us there, so maybe you should have named it something else.  By the way, what kind of coffee is this?  Whatever.  It's just medium roast.  Medium roast.  Yeah.  What happened?  I asked for flavored.  I said, just not decaf.  Oh, I thought you meant you didn't want the Starbucks machine.  Oh, boy.  No, I just wanted flavored.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's okay.  Don't let that get at your confidence now.  Yeah, we want to build this one up.  You're doing well.  You're the one we have chosen to save.  We save one person every few years. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, you're like a duck covered with oil.  We're going to wash you off and send you on your way.  We will build him up, but we'll...  We're going to build him up.  We'll ask another intern to get the coffee, though.  Oh, that's not building him up.  Remember when Greg Brady lost the plans, when his father gave him that responsibility?  Yes, I do.  What was he doing when he lost the plans?  He was talking to a girl that he knew, and I think he left it in the car.  Yeah, was it?  No, no, no.  He left the... 
[01:01:30]  He was reading a magazine.  He was reading one of his Hot Rod magazines, and it fell out of the tube and went in the  gutter and stuff.  His Hot Rod magazine.  And then his father gave him another shot at it, because he knew his confidence was going  to get it.  Sure.  And Greg, yes, fucked up again.  He did.  And did his father say, why don't you smuggle them in your hiney like I do, in the long tube?  He should have.  How about we give the kid a chance to get the right coffee?  He'll have a nice small victory today.  Your coffee was okay yesterday, right?  Yeah, it was good. 
[01:02:00]  I liked it.  Who did that?  Oh, no.  Not enough milk, right?  I know what Sam's doing.  I'm not playing your game.  I loved yesterday's coffee.  You did?  He might have needed a little milk, but I went and got it myself.  Who cares?  I'd love to have a nice flavored coffee with some skim milk in it.  No problem.  I can go get that for you.  He's going to bring the cup, and then the coffee, and then the skim milk.  In his hands.  In his hands.  Just pouring it out.  Because he doesn't want to drop anything.  Poor young Connor.  Connor.  Holy shit.  You didn't tell him what flavor.  Oh, no.  Just any flavor. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Let's see what flavor it is.  What if it's jizz?  I hope he shouldn't have to get his own milk.  I didn't mind.  No, probably not.  I didn't mind, Sam.  It was fine.  But why send an intern to get coffee if you have to get your own milk for it?  He should be fired up.  Oh, Edgar.  Edgar.  What happened there?  Get me milk.  Oh.  He's a beverage.  I don't like Edgar at all.  Teeth are...  Yeah.  Very dry.  Very dry.  It upsets me.  I feel sorry for him, and I don't want to.  Well, that was a nice little chit-chat with one of the interns. 
[01:03:00]  Sure.  Are we in trouble, E-Rock?  Did we say anything inappropriate to the intern there?  Yeah.  Do we help with his confidence?  No, you're all good.  We're all good?  You're sure?  The management's not going to...  Do you have to report back every time we talk to the intern?  Yeah, where's Gary?  He's supposed to be in here and informed.  You have to write a form of...  Oh, shit.  Eric wasn't in here just now when you guys talked.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Eric was supposed to be in here.  I'm fucking busting you, man.  You're supposed to be in here.  I'm building up that kid, but I'm knocking that one down.  Good.  In the room so we can physically stop things that are happening.  Knocking you off your strained perch.  That's right. 
[01:03:30]  So why was E-Rock...  Why do you think he didn't come in?  Yeah, why were you in here?  Dozen.  He was up late watching Raw 1000.  All right.  I saw the tweets.  Oh, my God.  How pathetic you guys are.  You were live tweeting with us?  No, I was live tweeting how sad your tweets were.  I got a lot more followers from you.  Thank you.  Oh, very good.  How was Raw?  Fucking awesome.  Who was wrestling?  Brock Lesnar was on it.  How'd he do?  Well, Triple H got the better of him.  Oh, boy.  They didn't have the match. 
[01:04:00]  That's not until SummerSlam.  That's stupid.  He's an MMA guy.  Who does?  He should have been able to kick Triple H's ass.  But why doesn't he take some of his MMA moves and take care of Triple H?  Oh, he's trying.  We'll have to wait and see what happens at SummerSlam.  I like how you're trying to rope me in by saying Ass Man.  The Ass Man was there.  And I...  I'm a lot of...  Yeah.  Zen, Zen.  I was trying to say, did they play his song?  No.  Zen, Zen.  Why wouldn't they play his song?  This is the best fucking song ever. 
[01:04:30]  He came out to the D-Generation X music.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  So what?  There's probably a problem with this song now.  Oh, gosh.  But they live to kick out.  Is there a problem with this song?  Well, they didn't call him badass.  Stick song.  Really good.  But they would still...  Wrestling wouldn't back out like that, would they?  They'd been backing down, too.  I mean, they're...  You know that, Sam.  Because his name is...  They're trying to train kids.  Yeah.  Who's the Ass Man?  Well, kids love ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, but their parents don't.  Oh.  What a great song.  Yes, I'm an Ass Man. 
[01:05:00]  Yes, I'm an Ass Man.  Of course you are.  It's so self-descriptive.  It's nice.  It answers questions.  He's an Ass Man.  He tells you he's an Ass Man.  And then he tells you what he does with the asses.  So many asses.  So little time.  Right.  Of course.  What is he like?  Right.  Of which kinds?  Of every kind.  Oh.  The best surprises always stick up from behind.  Oh, that's what he got from behind.  Look out.  Look out.  I'm an Ass Man.  Oh, this is great. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, I'm an Ass Man.  Woo!  I'm an Ass Man.  Just in case you didn't get it.  He's an Ass Man, by the way.  Yeah, that's what people always say to me.  Great fucking song.  Yeah, but there's a comma in there.  Yeah.  You think you're a fucking asshole.  No, because you're an asshole.  Okay, the coffee's coming back.  CM Punk had a big heel turn.  Yeah, he's a bad guy now.  I thought he was a bad guy, no?  No.  He went good for a while.  Now he's back to bed, I guess.  Am I retweeting me, pal, has a heel turn? 
[01:06:00]  He's tweeted me since then, so.  Oh.  So, wow.  I'll just text him and ask him why.  What's this kid's name again?  Son of a bitch.  Connor.  Hi, Connor.  Oh, here he comes.  Thank you, Connor.  All right, so you went and got flavored coffee.  Jimmy's going to taste it.  Well, it's good.  I can tell you what flavors you used.  Good job.  Con Con.  Con Man.  It's Hazelette.  That's good.  That's a good choice.  I'm not a Hazelette fanatic.  I wiped it off a Hazel's face.  It's a safe choice. 
[01:06:30]  For flavored coffee, you went for the safe choice.  Yeah.  I didn't get too crazy.  My favorite part of that fucking childish improv was the fact that no one has been named Hazel  since 1960.  Of course not.  Stupid Hazel.  Washed it off of Hazel's face.  Oh, Komi, you're going to get me fucking fired.  Oh, shit, Chipper.  Double Conners.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Double Con.  How's the milk ratio?  I haven't tried it yet.  Why do you ask?  Why?  Why?  Has it not been a good job of milk? 
[01:07:00]  I didn't mind.  Hey, look, you know what?  It's actually the way I like it.  Beautiful.  You didn't mind what?  The coffee or you didn't mind having to get your milk?  I have no problem getting more milk for my coffee.  I know what you're doing, Sam.  Get out of the studio.  And I'm not playing today.  It's nice.  Get out of the studio.  I meditated last night.  I'm good.  I just don't know why you would have to do that.  I'm good.  You've never done that before.  No, I hope she didn't have to do that.  He's working on the show.  You meditated, right?  Well, can I...  A quick story.  It was...  I went to this class and it was only like three of us, including the teacher.  Oh, boy.  And after the meditation session, I was asking her long-term benefits to meditating. 
[01:07:30]  And one of the things she said was, you really just...  You just focused and tuned in.  Oh, yeah?  And I was like, oh, that's good.  I would believe that if you didn't call me Steve for half the fucking hour.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes.  But I couldn't tell her that she only had...  She had a 50-50 shot what my name was because there was only two of us.  Of course, the other guy's name is Steve.  Focus.  And she gets the name wrong.  She actually said lower blood pressure, this and that, all the health benefits. 
[01:08:00]  And then she goes, but the number one thing is you're just...  You're in tune and you're focused constantly.  And I couldn't break it to her that half the class, she got my name wrong.  Oh, man.  She kept saying Steve.  That's fucked up.  How great is that?  You changed it.  Because the old Opie would have lived to tell her that.  The old Opie...  No, not in my real life.  I don't do that stuff as much.  The old Opie would have loved telling her that.  On the radio show, 90 to 95% of the time, absolutely.  In my regular life, maybe 20%.  What's worse, getting cold Steve or not having enough milk in your coffee? 
[01:08:30]  I'm good with the milk, Chris, Sam.  I know what you're doing.  I'm just asking.  You're going to lose this time.  No, I'm just asking.  I like when you needle me and get me going.  But not today, man.  I'm good.  Question.  Connor, I liked how you prepared my coffee yesterday.  I just don't know why you would get milk, Ben.  I had plenty of time to march down the 50-foot hallway and get my own milk.  It's good.  Oh, oh.  See, if you're going to do all that trouble.  Length of the hallway.  It's good.  Added a little something in there like, I wasn't really appreciating it.  Plus, if you were satisfied with the milk that Connor had brought you, I just don't understand 
[01:09:00]  why the extra walk was necessary.  And I don't mind that it was three days in a row.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I'm good.  Oh.  I'm good.  We're building up Connor.  Yeah.  It couldn't have been three days in a row.  It's our project.  Build him up.  Come on.  We're building him up.  Let's not tear him down.  We're not tearing you down, Connor.  What do you like to do?  What do you do on the weekends?  What does a kid like you do?  I just go out on my lake on canoes.  I have a couple boats that I go out on.  Do you own a lake?  I don't own the lake.  I just live on it.  You live on a lake? 
[01:09:30]  Where do you live on a lake?  That sounds cool.  Are you a fucking Norman Thayer, Jr.?  Northwest New Jersey.  Northwest New Jersey.  You come a long way to get here.  Oh, oh, okay.  Sorry.  Kind of, yeah.  I live with my sister.  You live with your sister?  Yeah, she lives across the river, and I crash on her couch.  Jersey?  Yeah.  What happened to your parents?  Oh, they're still there.  It's just easier for me to take the bus and then drive here every day.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you appreciate that, you being there?  I clean and cook, so it's a fair trade.  What do you want to do? 
[01:10:00]  I mean, like, work-wise.  Like, you're interning now, but what's your goal?  Actually, my goal is to work here, be on the air.  Oh, boy.  That's a horrible goal.  All right.  Setting those sights pretty high.  Yeah, don't, don't, don't.  Enjoy your sister's couch.  If you do get a job here, you won't be looking for your own place.  Oh, I got hired.  I can find my own place.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  No.  Sam's been here eight years, and he still can't get his own place.  It's not a good goal.  Yeah.  It's not a good goal.  Sam, it's not a good goal, right?  No, it's a horrible goal.  It's the worst goal you could have.  There's a guy outside who sells pretzels in the morning.  You should try to get a gig with him. 
[01:10:30]  That's a good goal.  And at least balance out financially.  You know, I was actually somewhat envious of the guy setting up his cart to sell coffee.  Were you green?  Oh, God.  When I was walking to work this morning.  Yeah.  That seems like a, just like a nice life.  Nice little business, right?  Yeah, he's got his own little thing set up.  Yeah, meanwhile, he's got a fucking lug it in from Queens, driving two miles an hour.  Oh, those over the bridge.  Everybody beeps at him.  Those fucks.  I fucking hate those savages.  Dumb rolls and donuts are bouncing around.  Hey, you know what?  When I drive in the morning, I see them on the side of the road setting up, and I see these 
[01:11:00]  motherfuckers with no glove or anything, just handling your rolls, taking this old butter  out, and just slopping it on there and stacking the rolls up, just fucking picking his nose.  People don't even know what the fuck they do.  They're just dumping them out of cardboard boxes.  They're not wrapped.  Terrible.  No.  Oh, God, no.  They're not individually wrapped.  No.  Not doing any.  Doesn't donuts in a box with nothing else.  You want falafel?  You want jato? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.  Their shit is good, though, man.  I want to eat at the one on...  You ever drive 6th Avenue at night?  You go up 6th Avenue.  There's always one where the club's let out, where he's got fucking 90 people on his line.  Oh, I've seen that guy.  I want to eat there, because chances are you're not going to get sick, because everybody eats  there.  You don't get sick in general.  I would eat there, though.  Most places.  No, you know, it's just disgusting.  I don't trust them, though.  If the radio thing doesn't work out for Connor, do you think he could be embarrassed at Starbucks?  Oh.  I could train him.  I'm sure they have a training program. 
[01:12:00]  I'm sure.  It's pretty easy, and your vacation time is great.  You accrue it by the second.  Every month, you get a second of vacation.  Oh, boy.  There's a cross-dressler that tried to rob CBS.  Oh, no.  That's a bad cross-dressler.  Oh!  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey.  No, Connor's good.  We're going to help him out.  All right, Connor.  You're the guy we help.  I think you got it.  Get Connor on the phone.  Uncle Kev, you're wearing it. 
[01:12:30]  I want Connor on the phone.  I want to build his confidence.  Why do you guys...  Why do you guys...  Get Connor on the phone.  I'll ask you this, though, now that he can't hear.  Why do you guys pick interns that have that distant stare always?  We don't have, like, a lot of great interns to pick from.  It's either him or fucking James Holmes.  Like that.  I think it's Uncle Kev.  Uncle Kev.  I said hi to him yesterday.  I think he stared completely through my body.  Uncle Kev.  He's got a weird stare.  I love Uncle Kev, though.  He's a jolt.  He's a moron.  I don't know what goes on.  Oh, is he a dummy?  He's a stupid guy. 
[01:13:00]  When was the last...  Who was the last intern that we had that didn't have that distant stare?  I guess Sal.  Oh, it's Travis.  There you go.  Sal.  Manny.  Sal didn't have that distant stare.  That's why he got hired.  But there was a long, long line of distant stares before Sal.  Yeah.  You know?  Every time.  Every time.  Every fucking time.  Sal and Manny.  The same jokes.  Oh, I stink.  No, it's funny.  It's just this...  I was laughing recently thinking of every time certain people call, it's the same thing. 
[01:13:30]  It has to be, yes.  Mike.  Mike.  What's another one?  It's like every time...  Oh, Bill.  Bill.  Oh, there's a couple more.  I was just laughing at the silliness of that.  And then the other one with...  You're kidding.  What was his name?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone died.  John.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's always a few.  That's from 15, 16 years ago.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Connor's on the phones now.  All right.  Does the Hi, John call hold up? 
[01:14:00]  I don't know.  I haven't heard it in so long.  Fuck, yeah.  I think it does.  That's where the guy...  Oh, wait.  Is that Bill?  Bill's dead?  Oh, yeah.  That one's brutal.  That's a great call.  I haven't heard that in a year.  That one's brutal.  You're kidding.  You're kidding.  You got that, Iraq.  Oh, God loves him.  Because it helps people understand.  Anthony says, you're kidding a lot.  It does kind of help to understand.  Oh, yeah.  This is where it comes from.  I guess we haven't played this in years, basically.  Oh, wow.  We used to love when we were up in Boston or Worcester or wherever the fuck we broadcasted 
[01:14:30]  from and made believe we were a part of the Boston Metro.  Yeah.  All the other radio stations would call our hotline because it was one number off.  So we got to fuck with a lot of people, man.  A lot of people called the wrong number.  And, oh, my God.  This was a fucked up day.  We were obviously pissed off at Dave Douglas, so we had to take it out on somebody.  Yeah.  And this is what we did that day, if you have it, E-Rock.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat. 
[01:15:00]  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  Yeah.  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Oh, yeah.  Big, big, big pile.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences. 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  I'll be the first to admit that's just horrible.  You're kidding.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Oh, God.  Who is this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  My favorite one ever.  And it wasn't one of our best ones by far, but the Harrington House. 
[01:16:30]  Harrington House.  We couldn't even bring it all together in the end, unfortunately.  What a disaster he was.  But we would call, like, random houses and make believe we were, like, their daughters and sisters.  They'd just call up and say, how are you going to be over for dinner later on?  And we lucked out, and we got this guy that, man, some things were happening in his brain.  Yeah, definitely.  And he was very confused and was trying to figure out, you know, trying to figure out if he had a son that he didn't know about or something that he couldn't wrap his head around. 
[01:17:00]  You're coming over?  I don't know.  I'm explaining something that makes no sense to most people.  Whatever.  But it is one of my favorites.  So you went to yoga to relax or meditation to relax.  I went to the range.  Nice.  And fired off my .50 caliber Desert Eagle. 
[01:17:30]  But they do...  It was relaxing.  Both those things do the same thing.  Yes, it was very relaxing.  Both those things do the same thing.  Therapeutic.  Yeah.  Just giggle.  Bam!  Bam!  Oh, it hurt my arm.  Do you know that, like, that difference...  And that's real.  Like, you really went to yoga, and you really do go to meditation.  You really do go to the range.  Yeah.  And it's just so funny to me what you guys doze off.  Like, how different.  Yeah, it really is.  It's fucking...  But it's the same thing, though.  Oh, this gun's fucking sick. 
[01:18:00]  But it really is the same thing in the end.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That is so hard to shoot that gun.  Wow.  Funny, too.  Yeah, it's funny, too.  It's a 50-caliber handgun.  Wow.  A 50-caliber handgun.  Hilarious.  And some guy's like, you got a 50-caliber over there?  That is hilarious.  What the hell is this? 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  Is it people?  Yeah.  Everyone, when you shoot that thing, everyone from the other lanes that are in the same  room as you, they just stop shooting and all, like, peek over, like, what the fuck are  you...  What do you have?  And I got a dumb question.  I'm going to acknowledge it's probably dumb.  You're not allowed to let someone else use your guns at a range, right?  If they have a license, I can.  So you can?  If they have a pistol license, yeah.  If they have a pistol license, I could do that.  Have people ask, I want to shoot that thing?  No. 
[01:19:00]  God, I would.  I don't know.  That's a big one.  Ant was letting me shoot it in his yard.  I was running blue plates, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I believe you shoot it in the dirt anymore.  That's a big fucking...  I've never shot a handgun in my life.  That would not be a good first choice.  I don't think it's crazy, the two things we do, because in the end, it's relieving stress  and just, you know, getting away from everything.  It's great.  I've brought, like, three guns with me, three pistols, and just fucking rattle off at some  targets downrange. 
[01:19:30]  It's just fun.  There's people in there.  One guy, though.  Jeez.  If there's ever a stereotype of some fucking, like, the people that are like, oh, guns,  and it's this kind of person.  Guy, I don't know this guy from a hole in the wall.  A hole in the wall at the range.  I get it.  And he comes over, and he just, he starts talking about how he was somewhere, and he  told somebody he was from New York, and then the guy said, oh, well, you're from that nigger-loving  state. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  And this guy's relaying the story to me like I'd be fine with that.  He must be a fan of the show.  He didn't, he never heard of me.  And, you know, I don't think he knows me at all.  He was comfortable saying that conversationally.  He was just having that conversation with me, and I was just kind of, all I'm thinking  is, like, why would you say this?  That over-the-shit racism drives me nuts.  It's really crazy.  I understand all of us have some kind of racism in us. 
[01:20:30]  With that over-the-top, just throwing the n-word around it, and just assuming that you're  cool with that, I fucking hate that.  The assumption is a little odd in this day and age.  It really is.  I mean, you know.  Look, if that's what you're into and you want to use that word like that, fine, but  don't assume, like, I want to hear it.  It doesn't bother me to hear it.  When someone's over-the-top with that shit?  No, it drives me nuts.  It doesn't bother me like that, but it makes me think.  I'm like, you know, he doesn't know if I'm, I could be married to a black woman. 
[01:21:00]  You know, it's just, you know.  He probably, I don't know how, but someone talking to you just intuitively knows you're  not.  That this is not going to be a Pulp Fiction situation.  I know.  Bonnie's not coming home in a nurse's outfit, and you don't really fucking have gourmet  coffee.  Yeah, Jewel.  Everybody kind of knows.  What does that 50 Cal go through?  Wow.  It'll go through cinder block. 
[01:21:30]  It'll go through body armor.  Are you allowed to carry that on the streets of New York?  As a matter of fact, I'm not sure about 50 Cals in New York City.  I could carry it out on Long Island.  I wouldn't.  There's no practical purpose to have that gun.  Scare everybody.  It is a frightening weapon to have, but there's no practical purpose.  It's too heavy.  It's too big to carry.  The accuracy is not that good.  It's just too big a gun, and the fucking recoil is too much. 
[01:22:00]  But, again, when people say there's no need to have that gun, I agree.  There's no need.  But to shoot that at a range, it's fun.  It's entertaining.  It's something I like to do.  It's a challenge to try to hit your target with something like that.  So, no, I don't need it, but I fucking want it.  Yeah, you know?  It's one of those things.  Hey, did we do a version of Bill's Dead in Spanish?  Was that the one we did in Spanish?  People are saying that one was hilarious. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, hang on.  How did we do that?  I forget.  I remember we decided that, I think when we were in New York at N.E.W., we wanted to grow our audience.  Right, right.  And we figured the only way to do that was to put our bits in Spanish.  Yeah, we heard Spanish-language radio stations were coming up in the radio.  And as crazy as that sounds, we actually, I think it was Ant, right?  You mostly did the Spanish tags?  I tried.  They actually made us do Spanish tags for certain commercials.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was XM? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, we did this at XM.  The Bill's Dead in Spanish is...  But at N.E.W., they absolutely had commercials where we had, or Anthony did them at the time, I believe, tags in Spanish.  God, yeah.  How stupid is that?  Stupid.  Let me hear The Bill's Dead in Spanish.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm getting...  Hang on.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  It's part of the worst of it.  I'm getting right to it.  Hang on.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Fucking Fancy Pants. 
[01:23:30]  He's writing down his favorite moments from Raw.  Is he?  Mm-hmm.  Did he write them down?  For fan fiction?  Fan fiction?  Fan fiction time.  Yeah, he writes down his favorite moments, and then he starts writing his own storylines based on them.  I love the idea of him writing fan fiction.  Wrestling fan fiction.  He does.  How awful would that be?  He does.  He writes his own fantasy cards.  People actually do that?  Yeah.  You rock writing it all childishly with a crayon.  What a douchey thing to do.  Oh, terrible.  Terrible.  I like Star Trek erotica fan fiction.  That's hilarious. 
[01:24:00]  What is that?  Star Trek homoerotic fan fiction.  That's a good one, right?  No, no.  People actually write romantic stories between Spock and Kirk, falling in love, and yeah, yeah.  That's what Fifty Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fan fiction.  Was it?  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  All right, here's Bill's Dead in Spanish.  Spanish.  Hola.  Hola.  Hola.  Quien es esto?  Patricio.  Patricio, como estas?  No estoy hablando con el que llamo equivocando.

[01:26:00]  Esta bien.  Gracias.  Hasta luego.  Hasta luego.  La carretera.  We could be entertaining in Spanish as well.  I forgot how funny that is.  Just to...  Fuck the words.  You know, obviously we're getting them all wrong and everything, but just the inflection?  Like, for her to...  Oh, that shit.  I go...  Oh, that's fucking funny.  did that make sense sam i know you know a little spanish you don't want people to know that but 
[01:26:30]  yeah it made sense i mean your inflection was way off the map but but did we say the right words for  the most part for the most part we need dialect coaches yeah you need a little bit i took six  years of spanish i think i did pretty good did you really i mean that's not too yeah you should  just be fucking rattling off i don't know shit my brother who didn't take any spanish uh speaks  that dirty shit oh yeah to all his people at the restaurant oh nice he knows how to he knows how  to converse in spanish it's amazing to watch in the classroom though that's dumb keep his people in

[01:29:30]  watch this thing no i saw the highlights i saw the clips the mayor you know i guess he thinks he's  doing the right thing whatever but i don't mind that he's talking about it he's a buddinski it's way 
[01:30:00]  better than talking about dumb sugary drinks sugary drinks at least he's fucking bringing it up  it's a tough topic for these politicians they're all scared to talk about it yeah yeah you're not  going to hear romney or obama talk about gun control especially around uh re-election time  you're not going to hear a peep out of those guys about gun control or how they feel until after the  election but mayor bloomberg is a little uh out of touch also you know yes well let's go through  the audio and see what uh where the problems are what is your personal interpretation what do you 
[01:30:30]  think the founding fathers intended i wasn't there uh but we have a mechanism under our constitution  that the founding fathers put in to answer exactly that question it's called the supreme court the  judicial system up to the supreme court and the supreme court has ruled that you have a right to  bear arms but reasonable restrictions can be applied in terms of the kind of arms the number of arms who can 
[01:31:00]  buy them and that sort of thing and that's what really matters it doesn't matter what you think  or i think it matters what the supreme court thinks and what the legislature does and you come back to  the history of the country we started out with our muskets and today here we are where some people think  everybody should be armed uh... there was a congressman that i heard quoted i didn't hear him  directly but he was quoted as saying uh... if we had armed everybody in that theater then somebody 
[01:31:30]  would have put it pulled a gun and shot the uh... young kid who killed twelve people and injured  fifty-odd uh... i don't know that you would want to or have your kids in that theater when everybody  starts shooting who knows who is the one that's going to get shot pretty soon it's a circular firing squad  here's what's annoying about him like he wouldn't answer what he thought the founding fathers but we  understand we this is why they're all so hateable we understand what the judicial process is but what 
[01:32:00]  do you think they meant by that yeah why don't you just answer the question right what do you think  what do you think he's asking you what you think we have the supreme court to tell us none of these guys  will answer the question that's just because it'll alienate their uh... potential voters in in a lot of cases  bloomberg has armed security  right so for him it's uh... why don't you walk around without armed security then 
[01:32:30]  yeah go ahead give that a whirl  oh that's right you're a billionaire even believe me even if it wasn't for a fucking uh... him being mayor  oh that's right for you it does it's different right for you  yep uh... bloomberg talks about the current gun laws i mean for example if i wanted to buy an  assault weapon a load of ammunition on the internet for example and i lived in new york even with the  laws that you have and they're more stringent than the many places in america have you got anywhere  stopping me you can't stop everything but you can stop most of it uh... this fit the federal government 
[01:33:00]  passed laws restricting the ability to buy certain kinds of weapons assault weapons law expired or was it wasn't renewed  uh... that you can't sell the people with uh... mine up minors can't buy and uh...  uh... drug addicts and psychiatric problems and criminals can't buy it  uh... the trouble is then the federal government in the usual wink wink of passing a law to satisfy one group but telling the other group don't worry about it will make sure it doesn't get enforced  they didn't fund any federal government in the usual wink wink of passing a law to satisfy one group but telling the other group don't worry about it will make sure it doesn't get enforced  they didn't fund any of the enforcement and there's no database that you have to check against or at least not a complete database 
[01:33:30]  what we've got to do  is say  we just cannot continue this kind of carnage  so uh... what  enforce the laws that are in place  i'm all for that  so uh... what  enforce the laws then  enforce the fucking laws that are in place  i'm all for that  believe me i don't like uh... what illegal gun owners do either  can we uh... and can we make the laws even tougher way tougher 
[01:34:00]  how do you do that  and and when you're not enforcing the ones that are there now  why make new ones  it's it's ridiculous  just enforce  there are plenty of laws in place to prevent people  we don't really enforce the laws  no  they're really not enforced that well  in what way  in new york they are  i mean this  he's talking about buying shit off the internet  it's  it's very difficult  to legally buy stuff off the internet  like that  this guy was stockpiling for a while  people think you can 
[01:34:30]  some people say there should have been a red flag that was raised  because of all the buying he was doing online  yeah  um...  red flag raised to who  i don't know  by the way  and then when when the red flag is raised  who then has to look and assess if that's a problem  i i was asked last night  uh...  do you think six thousand rounds of ammunition is excessive to buy online  and i said well who's buying it  is it a guy that runs a range  that might wanna uh... have ammunition there for for people that come in 
[01:35:00]  a private range  is it a guy that's buying ammo for all his buddies  so when they go out uh... on a weekend they all have a fuckload of ammo to shoot or hunt with  or hunt with or whatever  wouldn't that be easy to check  if it's a range guy  again  who's checking  i don't know  another government agency  and then  what's the  hold on who would check something like that you think  i have no idea that's just it  because you know who's checking  more about this than  couldn't local law enforcement  they always say  but then do you want local law enforcement 
[01:35:30]  coming to you and saying like  why are you buying ammunition  and and then  uh...  then you gotta  come up with a good reason  and and then  what if they say  i don't like your reason  uh...  they can make it so you can't get it  i'm just saying  no this is another government agency  that will be up your ass  and  know  that you are a person that  that has guns  know which guns you have  know where you keep  this is something that  i don't care what the court says  the founding fathers never wanted the government in charge of your weaponry 
[01:36:00]  i'll say this  they didn't  and you're right  but  people  didn't have this problem  when they were talking  first of all everyone back then  had guns  they did not have a problem  with gatherings of people just shot up by lunatics at school students  like it's a phenomenon they didn't have to deal with  and uh... i don't want anybody just questioning everyone who buys ammunition  but i do think  that as the public we have  the right to know if someone's buying 600 rounds 
[01:36:30]  six hundred rounds  you're right  six thousand  oh i'm sorry  yeah  there's plenty of legitimate people who would be buying that  like you said  a range owner  there there are i'm sure ways  to to weed out  people who are legit automatically and immediately  um i don't want to  who's going to determine  if you're  the one that can buy six thousand rounds  and then if it's not six thousand rounds  how many rounds is it  right  five thousand is it five hundred  and and what determines 
[01:37:00]  that you are fit  to buy  that many rounds  did they buy it from what kinds of different  was he buying from different places  i don't know  i'm imagining he was  what what's excessive for an average gun owner  ammunition  i don't even know that  i don't know i went through boxes of fucking ammo yesterday  yeah if you go to the range  i just went to the range and for an hour and a half  i was just blasting  how many did you shoot off you think  or rounds  i took fucking  fifteen  if you had to guess  i had boxes of fifty  and i went through 
[01:37:30]  one hundred  i probably blew off like three hundred rounds  around there  and that's one day  at the rate  one an hour and a half  at the range  three hundred rounds  three about three hundred rounds  yeah  about three hundred rounds  so it went when six thousand just seems like a lot  yeah  that's all i'm saying  but when you're just going pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop  at a range or something  right  or it's  i went through it very quickly  um  and you're  and you got the right answers  yeah  how do we do that 
[01:38:00]  and who's responsible for that  i'm not saying don't  is that something we want as a society  i don't know  it just seems like  i don't know  it seems like there should have been some kind of red flag  if all of a sudden this guy out of nowhere is buying all sorts of shit  that's just it  with this guy's case  this guy was such an anomaly in this situation  which doesn't help anybody  because  yeah  because uh... like we said yesterday  you know  the guy only had a speeding ticket  that's it  very hard to determine that this guy wasn't fit  and average grades in in uh... med school i guess  that's a  that's all we really know about his background 
[01:38:30]  lots of red flags pop up in hindsight  it's easy to say  like that  but this guy could have just been anybody  if you would have kept him from buying a gun  you really are cutting out everybody  because the guy fit all of the rules and regulations  to uh... to buying a gun  that hurts the nra's case  it does  it's a lot  i hate the fact that he  did this  but people also need  need to know that these things do happen 
[01:39:00]  people aren't fucking  very predictable  they're not robots  machines  it's very hard to tell if someone's gonna lose their fucking mind  people are just  people already know the illegal guns aren't gonna get off  you know  it's a very  it's hard because  it's an avoidable thing  i mean  it is an avoidable fucking thing  but uh...  i don't know man  i don't even know what i'm saying  it's  i guess i hear both sides of it  it's very hard to come up with an answer  it's extremely complicated 
[01:39:30]  very complicated  it's not that easy to solve obviously  a lot of people say things  but they don't take it the next step and say  all right  how is that going to be enacted  how would this be enforced  what government agency would then take care of  checking on this  and checking on that  and then if they do check  what's their criteria for you being able to do something  yet like no one wants to go to that point  they're just like  well we ought to  there was a red flag  they ought to have said  red flag  okay the gun shop owner is supposed to report somebody 
[01:40:00]  for being what a little weird  i don't know what  i just think people are looking for  i just think if you're a gun shop  you have a huge responsibility  yeah  i just wonder you know  if there's more those guys should be doing  i don't know  there are plenty of gun shop owners that  have seen people that are weird  and just don't sell to them  it's happened  right  but you don't hear about that shit  right  i know  what drives me nuts is when this shit goes down  they they obsess about the assault rifles 
[01:40:30]  the assault rifles  when you know the real problem in this country  is the amount of people dying from handguns  yeah  yeah  handguns is way more dangerous than assault rifles  yeah  handguns are the  but they'll they obsess like  oh we got to get rid of these assault rifles  and then everything will be okay  really  yeah  people are dying everyday from handgun  handguns  but uh  and also  a lot more people  illegal handguns  illegal handgun violence  and uh  that  that is  is key  i mean 
[01:41:00]  people are under the impression  that you could just walk into a store  and buy a machine gun  so many people are under the impression  that no matter what state you're in  you could just walk into a store  buy a full automatic machine gun  and shoot up a fucking school or a theater  or what have you  see you shouldn't be able to do that  yeah exactly  but they would say to you  well this guy got one  i mean not a machine gun  but he's a rifle  right  but he didn't  right  he was he was able to get a semi-automatic uh  rifle  legally  yeah 
[01:41:30]  right  yes  because he fit  he fit the bill  um as far as handguns go  i don't know what other states  you know i i've never lived in other states  and had uh pistols  but in new york  i literally have to go to the police station  get a piece of paper  go to the gun store  buy the gun  they fill out a thing on that piece of paper  take the gun and the piece of paper  back to the police station  where they then check the gun  write down the serial number  take another piece of that little paper off  and uh put it in their file  and then i could take it home with me 
[01:42:00]  yeah you're here to say that it's not as easy as people would assume  it's not always as easy  online purchases  if i want to buy something online  i have to uh go online  pick out what gun i want  have them ship it to a gun store  let's say uh you know the coliseum  uh uh gun traders  i i use in uniondale  uh they ship it to them  oh yes  they have to ship it to the gun store  not to my house  and then i have to go through the same rigmarole  i gotta go to the precinct  i gotta get the piece of paper  i go to the gun store  i he charges a little fee 
[01:42:30]  for the transfer  but it's exactly like buying a gun  from him  only i paid  the online thing  i can't just  i assumed like most  that you probably got to  you get a fedex box  hey it's another gun  no it has to go through  what about this clown  did he have to do that you think  uh  or were there laws different in colorado  i don't know what colorado's laws are  for purchasing pistols  i don't know  i think that's fair though  and and i have  first of all i had to have my license  in order to even buy a gun  like that online 
[01:43:00]  uh and go through my my gun shop  to do it  uh with that license  i go through a rigorous background check  every purchase i make  every time i go in to buy a pistol  or a rifle  i get an fbi check is done on me  a new one  brand new one  every gun i buy  i think that's fair  and like anthony  what anthony has  would be considered excessive  if you were looking at like  people red flags  yeah  if anthony snapped tomorrow  no one would be shocked  but i mean  people would say  wow why didn't that raise red flags 
[01:43:30]  right right right  but anthony's not gonna snap  so he's just a responsible gun owner  with a bunch of guns  but i think that's fair though  even if it's annoying  you have to go through that  i do  i'm okay with that  i am i am for uh some of these types of restrictions  i just don't like the fact that there are so many restrictions on the ability to even get the gun  like once you get over that hurdle  then i don't really have many problems with the the going to the precinct getting the form  getting the gun going back to the precinct  it's a pain in the ass but look it's a gun i do understand this 
[01:44:00]  but new york state and especially new york city will deny you the ability to even go through those hoops  even if you're completely fine  you with no record or anything  they could determine you know because you didn't fill out your paperwork properly or  there's there's so many things that can happen uh in new york state the city forget about it  they could just tell you no for no fucking reason  you have to have a reason to have a pistol in new york city 
[01:44:30]  um and then go through all those things anyway  yeah  it's it's very like i don't mind the restrictions to purchase the gun  i do mind the restrictions on even being allowed to purchase a gun  can you get one for just a fucking i would love to get like a six shooter not like a fucking automatic  wouldn't that be fun yeah  i got a guy  that's why i got mine illegally it was a lot easier  you can't uh you can't get anything a six shooter a fucking uh automatic  well you want to know how easy it is to get a gun in texas 
[01:45:00]  yeah  also uh this guy purchased two thousand rounds of ammo with no issues  another guy says you buy ammo in bulk because it's cheaper  yeah so they make it uh we're you know enticing to get a lot of ammo  they entice they entice with their ammo prices  don in texas a state that knows how to kill fucking convicts  i like that i like that about you guys what's up  all right this is what you do you go  and they've got them pretty much every weekend anywhere in texas houston san antonio dallas 
[01:45:30]  you go to a gun show  you have a lot of cash and i'm sure that wouldn't be a problem for you  tell me about them  um and basically you've got guys that they'll have their whatever rifle i mean  anywhere from a shotgun down to a pistol and they'll just walk around with a sign  hey three hundred dollars cash  you pay the guy three hundred bucks cash you walk out with the firearm  no questions no paperwork no nothing  now there's the other way to do it where you know what they call with papers 
[01:46:00]  is you walk up to one of the booths  you sit down  takes maybe five minutes to fill out all the federal paperwork  as soon as you're approved  you sit there and you pay whatever it is  i mean hell i got a nine millimeter  that's one of them off-brand bullshit ones  a nine millimeter for 275 bucks  i gave the guy the money within say ten minutes  i walked out of there with a pistol and about 500 rounds  all right i i got a i got a question i've been to uh dallas uh is what i know about texas a few times 
[01:46:30]  i was amazed at how many guns i saw i i couldn't believe it  what kind of handgun violence you guys have in let's say dallas compared to other cities in america  or do you know this and i know that  oh yes sir  no no no go ahead and you're the expert  no i'm not an expert on texas and their fucking uh laws  but um from what i i know and the what i have read  i've always heard that that uh the more lenient  the gun laws the less gun violence there is  i just that that seems to be what what happens across the country 
[01:47:00]  it is  because i i don't hear about a lot of uh handgun violence in texas like we hear about in chicago  obviously chicago seems to be the big one  a lot of crimes are thwarted in texas uh because of um  but man we went to a club or public or a radio station event and the girls were all talking about how they left their handguns in the glove compartment to come into the bar  it was just like it was amazing how many guns were down there  yeah yeah  and this is also why people in big cities and and you know on the coastal uh liberal areas of new york or la and places that do have very strict gun control 
[01:47:30]  they are under this impression that the whole country is for gun control and for the uh uh restrictions that are in place in a lot of these big cities  when the fact of the matter is when you look at the midwest and the vast part of the united states in between the the coasts  a lot of people do own guns  there aren't many restrictions on them  and they want to keep it that way  right 
[01:48:00]  okay here's more bloomberg  some day there will be  a shooting which you would think would trigger in the american psyche  this  i'm not going to take it anymore attitude  maybe if you i thought it would be this way wait wait a second maybe if you shot a president  but ronald reagan when he got shot didn't trigger it  maybe if you shot a congresswoman  no maybe if you shot a bunch of students on campus no  maybe if you shot a bunch of people in movie theaters  i don't know what it is we obviously haven't gotten there yet 
[01:48:30]  uh but we just this cannot continue  and these people that want to have more guns  really are not just they don't understand what they're asking about  you are 22 times as likely to shoot a family member  than somebody trying to break into your house if you have a gun  you have  i i just hate these guys talking  you have armed security  so for you it's easy to sit there  i fucking hate these guys 
[01:49:00]  that just don't acknowledge that they are protected  so they're making this statement from a much different place  than the way anybody else thinks about it  mike bloomberg does not need to carry a weapon  uh... because he has people around him constantly  that carry  weapons that aren't even available to the general public  yeah he should start by saying you know follow my lead  i now have no arms again  right exactly  all of my guys have masons  i'm depending on the exact protection 
[01:49:30]  that you will receive  um... when you don't have a gun  uh... that's what i'm gonna do  how about that mr. uh... mayor  yeah  mrs. mayor  uh...  people want to talk about this issue  i want to know if they're for or against  so we can balance it out  just get some different voices on the radio there sam  how do i know  let's get it from connor  how do i know  connor didn't mention it on the screen  oh connor  no he didn't  oh jeez  maybe it's a two trip screening  it is 
[01:50:00]  he's gotta  he's gotta rescreen him again  eric just said he's gonna send him back  no no no i told him to go back i'm like get their angles just saying i want to talk  just so we can get some different voices on i like when we do that  is that what the screen set just says i just want to talk about gun  yeah yeah which makes it you know tough because especially if it's points we've made uh... a lot  it's like why bother screening the calls  uh... in the meantime here's more bloomberg  where you have effective enforcement against people carrying illegal weapons on the streets  guns in particular you will see gun crime come down 
[01:50:30]  no  that is just an undeniable in our  you motherfucker  he's a liar  how about detroit and chicago  two prime examples  turn on that chicago fucking scanner  when you get it get the scanner app any night and turn on the chicago uh... police scanner  you will hear nothing but gunfire  and and uh... cops chasing around the sounds of bullets flying  all illegal  all fucking uh... uh... people breaking the law 
[01:51:00]  they... and they have complete restriction on firearms  how about this  let's find if we can  the top five  most violent gun cities in this country  yeah  for illegal gun violence  and the and the best five  right  let's count  very good  and let's find  what the gun laws are in each  maybe they're comparable  and let's see if it means anything racially  yep  or if it means anything  if it's simply the gun laws 
[01:51:30]  yes  or if it's simply  you know that the citizens can protect themselves  i know population will have something to do with that too  that's why i'm saying cities  well  uh...  uh...  he's he's fucking lying there  let's go back to that  that's why  gun control does not fucking stop crime  it never has  it's not that easy  it's statistically proven that it does not  deter the criminal element  stop it  it's way more complicated than that  yes  you're on cnn you dope  against people carrying illegal weapons on the streets 
[01:52:00]  guns in particular  illegal weapons  you will see gun crime  hold it hold it hold it hold it  illegal he says illegal guns  now what does that have to do with what we're talking about  people  buying guns legally  owning guns legally  as per their constitutional right  what is pierce talking about  oh when there's a lot of illegal guns that are taken off the streets  crime goes down  all right i'll even buy that  how do you get the illegal guns off the street  oh don't try to stop and frisk 
[01:52:30]  you're not even allowed  right  and this is what drives me crazy  because they say good police work  but everything  they don't allow the police to do good police work  they don't allow them  that's why this country is insane  yeah  they don't allow it  they don't even allow the police guys to do their good police work anymore  polite police work  yes  doesn't work  and hopefully they'll luck out and find something with their politeness  polite police work that doesn't offend or observe anybody  it's just so dumb  i believe in the bronx now  the bronx uh 
[01:53:00]  whatever the head muckety muck up there is  whatever they call them  i heard that on the way in too  he's starting to say  maybe we have to rethink  the uh  restrictions on stop and frisk  after that kid got shot  the four year old  so he even he's starting to go like  ah  maybe we want the cops  patting down some of these thugs  good for that guy  who's against that  like in chicago  where you know it's a gang and drug area  i'm not saying you should stand outside the college and frisk people  but if you see a bunch of guys 
[01:53:30]  you know what thugs look like  yep  and if you're wrong once in a while you're wrong  oh wow  you know what rednecks look like  you know what mob guys look like  you're not always right  but you know  and by the way when they talk about some crazy white guy like this  and and red flags and they should have seen it  what they're talking about in essence is profiling  absolutely  they're talking about  alright this guy fits this profile of someone that might unload in a movie theater  right  we should see this  we should use this information to maybe prevent it in the future  why can't you do the same thing for gang members 
[01:54:00]  or uh... people that have illegal guns and they're shooting other people  why can't you profile and say  that guy fits the bill  he's throwing up a red flag  let me check that out and see if i'm i'm right about this  because the liberals would argue that the white guy being profiled is being profiled behaviorally  whereas the black guy is being profiled purely on appearance  okay  down  yes  and it's just an undeniable inarguable factor 
[01:54:30]  get guns out of there when they can't use the guns  if the political leaders in this country continue to say nothing about this  gun sales increase at the rate they've been increasing  and we see more and more of these incidents  people will say  mayor bloomberg it's time you  ran for the highest office  nobody will say that  i've got a job thank you  i've got another five hundred and twenty eight days  i think it is god  in my job  enjoy it every day  i'm not gonna  you'll have a vacancy 
[01:55:00]  i'm not going to be president united states  i'm not going to run for president for the presidency  uh... but i am an american  and i care very much about our country  i have children  and you care about everything except the fucking rules in place to prevent fucking three terms  yeah  it's funny how he's really big on regulations and rules  right  yeah  but when it comes to getting out after two terms  he doesn't even give a fuck about that  that is no problem breaking the rules  he did that he got another term without any fucking votes  sneaky cock  without people saying  that if they wanted  and then a vote was put to the  uh... to anyone else having that many terms 
[01:55:30]  and people voted no  so obviously they didn't want him for three terms  this guy's a fucking piece of shit  yeah  uh... but i am an american  and i care very much about our country  i have children  and i care about uh... them  uh... presumably they will someday have uh... give me grandchildren  and i care about them i have a responsibility just like you do just like everybody does in this country  to try to address  the key issues  you and i can't solve the problem 
[01:56:00]  but we can demand that those  elected officials  who are  who want to be in charge  have a solution to the problem  charles and judge  ah... good one chipper  i know  oh  jesus  and then finally this  this is not a theoretical thing  these are human lives  uh... we have children sitting on the steps of their house  and a bullet whizzes by  there was a four year old i read i read in the bronx  an illegal bullet 
[01:56:30]  people say well the time is not now to address this  we have to grieve  well it's been  eighteen months since uh...  gabby giffins  it's been  five years  virginia tech  it's been  a dozen years since columbine  and what's the right time frame  now's maybe exactly the time to do it  and i think the president very eloquently express the country's grief  and that is his job and he did it very well and people appreciate him 
[01:57:00]  appreciate i'm sure him coming and  and trying to offer comfort  but that's only half the job  the president  no matter who the next president is  also has to have a solution to this problem  it is  prevention of the next disaster  that we have to focus on  there's nothing we can do about what happened in the past  all right  well  hey do whatever you gotta do to uh...  get illegal guns  that are shooting children in uh... on their stoops uh... in front of their house 
[01:57:30]  do what you gotta do  without uh... infringing on other people's uh... rights  how about that  enforce your laws  do it that way  they're already out there  there's plenty of laws against it  i think there's a law against murder right  uh...  let me see  let's see how to robert in uh... new jersey robert  yeah you're turning into the next ted nugent  do you prefer robert or bobbykins  i like bobbykins myself  that's what my mom calls me 
[01:58:00]  i know he is like nugent right  robert  well every place needs to be like new jersey new york  it needs to be more difficult  to acquire these things  i came from pennsylvania  it was ridiculously easy  yep  i walked in walked out with an ar  i  it would take me only overnight for a background check to get a five seven  all right  in new jersey it's much more difficult  ohio's uh... very easy too  all right so  is that a good place to start at  they did a background check on you  yeah i'm saying  yeah i mean that's 
[01:58:30]  that's what they have to do  how about  how about  how about being denied  um... the ability to buy a handgun  illegally  um... in the state of new jersey or new york  but  on what basis  exactly  on on on on a whim  how about on a whim  that somebody decides  um...  that you don't  they don't want you to have one  right  then i'll buy a samurai sword  you know 
[01:59:00]  all right  you want and  you want to protect your family  but i don't necessarily need  to have a  an afn-57  yeah that's great  i can buy a shotgun  cool so somebody  uh... comes into your house  and you hit him with a samurai sword  from fucking across the room  yeah  or a shotgun with a slug in it  yep  okay  how about when you're out on the street  you're gonna tote that shotgun around with you  you know and uh... and on that  if anybody was in that theater in aurora  they wouldn't have been able to get a shot at that guy  he's covered head to toe in body armor  there's smoke 
[01:59:30]  tear gas  hypothetical  i'm not gonna get into hypothetical situations there but  let me tell you something  and i've said this before  the worst possible scenario  is a one gunman  in a closed theater  shooting at unarmed people  in a pile against the doorway  some tells me if somebody else had a gun in there  it could only be better  than one guy  rattling off round after round  into masses of unarmed people  even though he was covered head to toe  uh... and i don't like getting into hypotheticals like i said but 
[02:00:00]  if a bullet were to hit him  he's not gonna keep shooting at the crowd  he's gonna get  that's it's gonna  it's gonna get his attention  perhaps  perhaps he would  perhaps he would run out the door  perhaps he could get a fucking lucky shot to his face  i don't know  but the thing is  what happened  was the worst possible scenario  an unarmed mass of people  and one guy with a gun shooting at them  yeah 
[02:00:30]  where's the cops  right  right  right  anywhere  you know you  you got i just  went by a horrible accident on  on uh...  you're kidding  around all the cars  lightning strikes  lightning strikes  lightning strikes  you're gonna have problems  you got to absorb it  you got to move on  yeah  all right my friend  thank you robert  yeah  oh  yeah  wow i said for real i said thank you  robert's ornery 
[02:01:00]  he didn't like the way that went  you got a different fucking opinion on the show  i said thank you i meant it  that whole lady driving into a lake  jesus  dummy  all right there goes robert  thank you bob  i'm sure people out there agreed with your your point on it  jeez  what what happened  this whole broad drove into a river  nice  i love it  she hit the gas pedal  goes into the river  i hit the gas instead of the break 
[02:01:30]  well i guess we're over the uh... movie theater shooting huh  uh... yeah  fox news has moved on to give her a break  give her a break get it  goes into the river  the second you  you think she lives by the river to begin with  i say good morning and night to the river  oh god yes  what happened  she hit the gas instead of the break  yeah  once you do that  it's just time to take the keys  that happens  from the old codger  why was she so close to the water  i know  she lives close to the river  she panicked 
[02:02:00]  uh... anymore of these calls  we got a lot of them  or we could take a break  yeah we'll take another uh... call i guess  why not  uh... i own a gun for my job  new jersey laws are just as bad as new york see  we've done that one  so that's why sam connor needs to help us out  and give a little more detail  see that would be a waste of time if we took that phone call  well why would he  i like connor  why would he put the same call up twice  look i want connor to have a few victories today  he got a coffee victory  he's gonna have a victory on the phones  i just don't know why i would put the same call up twice  he's gonna learn 
[02:02:30]  the same information  why would i know what you're doing  i ain't going there today  i just don't know why  i live in texas  i want to talk legal process of getting a gun  i think we all know it's pretty easy down there right  i think the other guy said that  so we've done that one too  well it's probably  he probably wants to say something like  that guy was saying you could just buy a gun  but there's a legal process to doing it  and then i think there's a way around it  so he's challenging the other caller probably  maybe  uh... paul you're challenging the other texas caller  that's all we need to know  no i'm not telling you that  i'm just saying that  i was calling in that 
[02:03:00]  i have a few illegal firearms  that i actually went through the legal process to get them done  and we do that you need to send off to the b-a-t-s  right  and to get the stamps done for all these weapons  uh-huh  so no matter what you do is  the government's always going to have a regulation  and a thorough background trick  before they issue any of these weapons  yeah right  see even in that case  says you  says you  uh...  sam justin in texas  buying ammo in bulk is cheaper  we already  it's just cheaper  we already said that one  so that's wasting a phone line right there  so tell connor he can hang up on that guy 
[02:03:30]  nicely  i don't know where he's learning  uh... jim in alabama  what's up alabama mole  hey you know first off uh...  the first gun that the guy used in the theater was a shotgun with double o buck in it  that's just a hunting rifle but  is that true and  yeah  why would he go with that gun first just to scare the shit out of people  you know scattering  that'll fucking that killed people  no i understand  the shotgun yeah  yeah  scatter shot 
[02:04:00]  i guess he just figured he'd go in there with a shotgun first yeah  terrible  but listening to the this windbag uh...  uh... bloomberg is the exact reason people stockpile  the government is now talking about trying to come up with  uh... expirable ammo  so that even if you do buy it  it just goes bad  so why not stockpile on the good stuff  wow  you think we uh... love our guns in america because we just don't trust our government in the end  it's pretty much for each other  or each other  or each other  yeah  you think 
[02:04:30]  i'm not worried about the government just coming in with guns at this point  but i am worried about other citizens  all right there jim thank you  you're welcome  that's just still my job  yeah right  any more of these then  uh... we could carry guns to the school with a permit  is in favor of the stop and frisk policy  yes i am  i think we all are  i think we all are  is there a problem with that  we're gonna fuck about hurting anyone's feelings  if a cop asked me  he's like hey sir  i want to fucking  get out of that schoolyard i want to frisk you  if he just wanted to frisk me for 
[02:05:00]  i'd be like oh yeah okay  and he'd be like hey hey whoa what you got there  and i'd tell him right away  no that would that would suck if he starts frisking  and he's like oh shit what do you got there  you should be defiant  you should be defiant  that's what i was  yeah  just be defiant  let's see your big second amendment speech to the police officer  it's my right pig  as he's fucking  it's none of your business  raping me with his gun  as he's fucking billy clubbing you  i think we did it for now  i mean this issue is uh... pretty strong 
[02:05:30]  yeah  it's gonna be uh... uh...  volleyed back and forth for a while  and then it'll just go away again  i guess there was a fight at uh...  fight fight  dark night rises in pittsburgh  and everyone just  panicked  everyone panicked  ran out of the place  they thought it was a shooting  a complete panic  and then another place  somebody went out of the emergency exit  at a theater  that was on purpose  people freaked out  they did it on purpose  yeah of course  and then the cops evacuated everybody  from the theater 
[02:06:00]  and they got their money back  and what about the one in Maine  what happened there  is it true some guy who was on  on his way  he had intentions of  bringing something into a theater  theater  a Maine lobster showed up  and they were like  what's he pinching everybody's tussies  or something  it's a good one right  oh fucking classic  double claws  ah see  did they arrest that guy in Maine  man brought gun to dark night  yeah  like why  what happened  he wanted to bring a fucking gun  into the theater  oh in case  well you know  i don't know  is it in case  intending on just fucking using it 
[02:06:30]  ah  um  the details are a bit sketchy  he had an arsenal of weapons  and press clippings about the  colorado massacre  found in his car  oh boy  uh  he was stopped by the Maine  State Police after speeding  112 miles per hour  in his Ford Mustang  oh boy  he told police he was on his way  to Derry New Hampshire  where he planned to shoot  a former employer  oh okay  oh that's good  let me see  is he a legal owner  is he a legal owner

[02:08:30]  and then we're with our corporate attorney  who's uh  she's like 5'2'' and she's really hot  and she always wears like short skirts  it's not why she got hired  she's a thorough professional  very good  and she goes oh because  anything with black is a porn  and I'm like you know what  I already got enough fantasies about my attorney  I don't need another one  don't tell me you know  that uh  oh you buy the URL  before you announce the book  I do  I try to  I try to  blacklist we couldn't get  because there's a million things with it  so why don't you make a different name  well you do like blacklist the novel  or something like that  oh right yeah  you know what 
[02:09:00]  I've got people working with me now  they're like  why are you buying all this internet stuff  you want people to go to bradthor.com  period  and I've always had that  but they said yeah  don't send people to different websites  because they're going to get confused  just send them to you  just one website  one central area  everything  one clearing house  one clearing house  did you have problems getting your name or  no I was lucky  I jumped on that early  yeah that's a good one  I'm worried about my kids though  you know one day my kids won't be able to find something  but um  you know we'll see  I'm keeping my kids off the internet  nothing cool  good luck  good luck with that  good luck with that 
[02:09:30]  how old are they  uh  they're seven and nine  wow  but you'd be surprised how well the taser works  I got a lot of  keeps them right in line huh  yeah  we did a PTA meeting  when my daughter was  my daughter was  or not  parent teacher conference  my daughter was in  what kindergarten  and we went in  and the teacher  I keep talking about stunning women  my wife is in the car and listening  it's going to be big trouble  uh  I'll have one of those nice evictions  all my  crap will be on the sidewalk  when I get home 
[02:10:00]  that's right  you gotta split that brag thormony  yeah that's  yeah half  wasn't that the Eddie Murphy thing  yes  half  she's a real hot  kindergarten teacher  but she wasn't like  with it  she didn't have a real good sense of humor  and she said  well you know  it's your first parent teacher conference  wanna know how you guys discipline at home  we ask all the parents  oh man  and she's like  do you do time outs  do you spank  and I go  nah I find  getting the gun out  and just waving it around  gets the kids attention pretty quickly  she's like  okay  department of children and family services  I got them on speed dial 
[02:10:30]  but Brad  I'm giving my kid time outs already  he's a little over two  he laughs  yeah  and you bite your teeth  you wanna  it's  you wanna go old school  and you know what  there's nothing wrong  you wanna go old school  because he sits there and laughs  like what is this  this is stupid  he knows it too it's stupid  of course  they're basically giving you the finger  with their eyes  yeah yeah  it's children are rough  you know what  there's nothing wrong with going old school  we've had the pussification of the American male  in this country for way too long brothers  and it needs to change  yeah  well 
[02:11:00]  what if you give the wrong answer to the  do you hit your kids question  you could be in a bit of trouble  is that a problem  or do they  someone might knock on your door  and ask some questions  you just you know  we can talk about it here  but when you get asked that question at school  it's just  it's disinformation  it's like a spy  deny  deny  deny  and launch counter accusations  can you hit your kids  what kind of question is that  counter accusations  you launch the counter accusations  right back out  isn't that more  isn't that invasive to ask that  or is that just normal now  it certainly seems invasive  how about the crap  when you're getting your prostate done 
[02:11:30]  and the doc wants to know  do you have a handgun in the house  you got that one at your doc  what  all the doctors now  when you go for your checkup  they're asking  do you own a firearm  why  because they want to give you the lecture  that firearms are dangerous  my wife's a doc  but what do my doctors have to do with that  like a health issue  yeah it's like  all what you should know  to keep it people get killed  with  I said to my wife  because she's a doctor  I said you guys ask if people own a swimming pool  more kids drown in swimming pools  and get killed with handguns  give me a break  unless I'm shoving it up my ass  and trying to hit my prostate  with it 
[02:12:00]  yeah yeah  exactly  you can have my gun in my prostate  when you pry it  from my cold dead ass  from my cold dead ass  yeah  wow  that's fucking invasive  that really is  that really is  yeah yeah  which part?  the doctor thing?  now that's hot  the question I mean  why would you ask that?  you're stupid  you guys see  next time you go into the doctor  they're going to ask you  and they try to lecture you on  they want to talk to you about safety  my wife said it's just like a seatbelt  I'm like that's none of the doctor's damn business either  yeah  that's not what mine asked me  she's like well do you tell women this before you sleep with them? 
[02:12:30]  I'm like lying  I'll let them figure it out  they'll know in a couple of months  they'll know in a couple of months  exactly  when the tests come back  yeah exactly  itching their vag with a rake  so where do you lie politically?  what do you think?  I kind of got a hint in the hallway before  fellas fellas fellas  you know this is great  because all the publicity people are outside  and I can't let it hang loose  when I'm doing kind of other media  right  but listen I'm a  I'm a  I'm a guy who is on the right 
[02:13:00]  I believe  I have a growing libertarian streak in my conservatism  me too  I want the government to get the hell out of my life  nice  leave me alone  right  I want to own my guns  I want to have the lowest taxes possible  the other thing I believe in  is  I'd rather give money to a soup kitchen in my neighborhood  or give money to a church in my neighborhood  to help people who are down on their luck  help them get on their feet  because if Bob  the guy who couldn't make his mortgage  and can't find a job  is in the local tavern  at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday  I want to kick Bob's ass  the federal government's not going to do that  they're not keeping tabs on Bob 
[02:13:30]  they're just sending him the checks  and we're getting close to a tipping point in this country  where we've almost got 50% of the people  not paying any tax at all  amazing right  that's a problem  is it really almost 50?  it's almost 50  we're like at 48%  and no one seems to see a problem with that  wow  and then not only that  but then they'll rub it in your face  and say you're not doing enough  when you're the one that's paying you  and these are people that aren't paying any taxes  just saying  hey you gotta pay more  you son of a bitch 
[02:14:00]  I think I'm doing plenty here  Jesus you guys had me a good morning  this is fantastic  I'm never leaving  this is my group  but you're making us all look bad  dressed like that  I did Don Imus' show  I did CBS this morning  we're pals at Imus  Imus  Imus is a great guy  you got a really expensive suit on  I was telling Anthony  I didn't tell Jimmy because he was out of the room  that I got a smelly shirt on today  Jesus  that's why they got you sitting over there  I'm smelling B.O. from last week  I thought this was a fresh shirt  and somehow it got in my shit 
[02:14:30]  and I knew when I got in the car this morning  I think this  I think  I hate having an old shirt on  I'm dying over here  and then I look at you  he's put together perfectly  he's fucking TV ready  Brad is TV ready this morning  you could be a TV anchor  well you know  how many books have you written  I think I'd go crazy  I think you'd see me go postal  if I had to be in the mainstream media  how many books have you written  we were talking about writing  it's gotten harder for me  to keep my attention focused on writing  I used to love writing  I still enjoy it  but it's like I get distracted too easy  I can't focus on writing anymore 
[02:15:00]  my fucking brain's all over the place  with the internet and stuff  I can't focus  well I do think the internet's changing  the way people read  I know even if I get an article  that spills onto more than one page  you know if it goes over two or three  I'm like oh geez  I gotta scroll through this  the book for me reading though  is one of the few things  that I can still enjoy  they came out with  somebody did an interesting study  in the last 12 months  said that if you're reading  on an e-reader device  you're retaining a lot less information  than if you're reading on a paper book  there's something about 
[02:15:30]  the paper book isn't perfect  and you flip pages  and the text moves  because you're turning pages  and there's a little bit of stuff  that's askew  but the e-reader's so perfect  if you don't jolt the eyes  and kind of trigger the mind  it doesn't  the material doesn't stay  I had never heard that  and there was an interesting  odd  I bet you fucking  Frank Borders put that out  Barnes and Noble  both said good points  both of them 
[02:16:00]  how do you feel about all these  dopes that are writing books  these days  it seems like everyone  throws a book out there now  the guys that aren't  traditional authors  and you could tell  I mean we've all read  some of these things  and you go  he didn't write this  well that's  he talked into a tape recorder  for a little bit  and then someone else  filled in the blanks for him  yeah there's  Keith Richards what  yeah there's  I enjoy the book  but I could tell  he didn't write this  he told a few stories  and then they put it  in book form  and now wow he's an author  no he's not  the non-fiction stuff 
[02:16:30]  I'm a little bit  I'm a little bit more  okay with  because I don't expect  these guys to be authors  if it's one book  and they're talking  about their life  but there's people  who are trying to get  into the book writing business  I'll take you guys off the air  I'm not doing it on here  but I just got an email  from a somewhat faded  Hollywood star  who wanted to write  a book with me  and I'm like really  I want to write fiction books  and I'm like  you gotta give us  a chance to figure it out  is it male or female  come on give us a chance  male  faded Hollywood star  Tom Cruise  guy who's bad at guessing 
[02:17:00]  has to be an action star  obviously  Brad Pitt  I hope he's getting close  a fading action star  it has to be an action star  now I've already insulted the guy  and I'm going to get my ass kicked  no fading is legit  I mean it happens in the business  you have  either Jean-Claude Van Damme  or um  Steven Seagal  Steven Seagal  Steven Seagal  keep guessing  keep guessing  he's throwing us off  no no no  the look he just gave you  for Steven Seagal  not Jackie Chan  he's an action star  but he's not fading  Mickey Rourke  Jack Norris  oh  Jack Norris 
[02:17:30]  could  could write probably  great books  I like Chuck  he's a good voice  I'll go back to Steven Seagal  yeah yeah  we need him  could be Steven  fading action star  not Schwarzenegger  uh  Dolph Lundgren  Mr. T  I wouldn't say  Stallone is not fading  I wouldn't say  Stallone is fading  um  no  no Stallone isn't  no  he's still a big  I don't know  Vin Diesel  Vin Diesel  Sally Field  Wesley Snipes  yeah we're selling  we're sending it back and forth 
[02:18:00]  yeah yeah yeah  yeah  toilet paper  boy that poor motherfucker  is it harder to sell books now because it's like uh  with with the you know borders done  and uh you still have certain books to  sell them more because you could get them digitally  but I know no but I'm saying  is it harder to like to get an actual hard copy  to sell the same amount of copies or no like to get on the bestseller list or  well we're seeing we're seeing a lot of people with e-readers and uh  and uh listen all of us in this room saw what the music business went through with the transition out of you know if we started with vinyl and then you know we went to eight tracks and cassettes and cds and finally digital and now you know you don't have to buy the whole album you can just buy a single so that's not going to happen with books you can't buy just a chapter a couple of pages a couple of pages but um it the landscape has changed and there's some people that don't like it and it's like you know what it's that's that's the deal technology's moving forward you got to stay with it so uh we we still are able to sell people a lot of books and one of the neat things about the e-readers and the 
[02:18:30]  e-books is is that you finish a brad thor book and you want the next one the links are right there you can just click right and we're selling in some cases you're selling the same book twice because people still want a hard copy at home but they want the digital version when they're traveling because they don't want to lug books around yeah so that's that hasn't hurt your sales no we're doing we're in a down market uh the my books are doing better and better every year so that's that's terrific how many bestsellers have you written uh this is my 11th 
[02:19:00]  jesus christ how many movies oh god we're working on the movie now we've got a we've got a deal with warner brothers and so they've just finished writing the first screenplay starring a faded hollywood star hell no and not matt fucking damon either there's no way that leftist bastard is ever going to be in one of my you know the only connection i got i love this in the born in the first born movie when he goes into the safety deposit box and he's got all the money he pulls out his passport 
[02:19:30]  that was really cool but that guy is the the born character is the ultimate liberal superhero he finds a million dollars that doesn't belong to him and so he redistributes it redistributes it all over europe you know i'll give you sixty thousand dollars to drive me to paris and blah blah blah blah blah blah and he's not responsible for his actions it's the government's fault and he doesn't start any fights but he'll finish it but only if somebody picks on him and it's all the government's fault i like this guy who's your main character like that i've never read a born identity book but you have one character through all your books i do 
[02:20:00]  i've got my books you can read in any order they're all meant to stand alone but i've got a guy who's a uh a navy seal who gets recruited into the white house uh to help bolster their counterterrorism expertise and he goes from there into the white house is pretty messed up and he actually goes into the private sector eventually transitions there and he's uh he's a private guy and you've done some research uh for your books overseas went to afghanistan a few years ago that was a blast how was that yeah some guys called me up uh reached out to me through a friend of mine they were on a team and they said 
[02:20:30]  how'd you like to come over and see what your character scott harvath really does i'm like afghanistan that's cool let me talk to the wife and the wife says as long as all the insurance papers are signed go have a good time exactly you know she's quite happy to make sure you get some close pictures of those ieds yes she gave you a yarmulke but i'm not too excited it's fine 
[02:21:00]  yeah i also got the t-shirt that said islam is the bomb in arabic and english farsi urdu pashtu i had it in many languages yeah so it was a blast it was a lot of fun and my wife my wife was really cool she said listen my job is not to say no if you want to do this go do it and so i went over to afghanistan and i had a great time one of the guys on the uh on the team is the medical guy so if anybody gets hurt or sick so a couple days into it the guy asked me he said how you feeling

[02:29:00]  wrong and it's a you're british so you can't get it and b you know i think he gets a little bit but  he doesn't get it he didn't grow up here he doesn't have he's not american yeah and you can be you can  be a guy who does your business here but you you don't have that i think in all fairness i got a lot of  people on twitter that were pissed that i was going on his show and i'm like yeah that's not  fair i listen i have good discussions with pierce he he likes my books and you know to say that you're  not going to deal with anybody who disagrees with you politically right no that's wrong it's like 
[02:29:30]  opening a delicatessen and hanging a sign that says no blacks no jews i mean that'd be  anthony teller contestant yes  one of these already exist  oh god jimmy but yeah that's true that they say you should like a lot of uh a lot of guys won't go  on fox because they're conservative so what why won't you go on and just debate the guys you don't  like or who cares and why not be a voice to say like i went on there so my role was not to go on and  debate they can find people who debated and he didn't want me to debate we we were on to talk about 
[02:30:00]  you know aurora but here's what's interesting he was doing a lot of debating he was getting into it  so my segment at the end of the show got shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter so it was cut  it was they had me on we did about five minutes normally pierce and i do a couple segments together  we did five and believe me as an author it's it's great i'm getting out to his audience yeah uh but  they said we've got a special guest coming in tomorrow night and what we'd like to do is have  you brad record a question to ask him i'm like who's the guest they said well we have michael 
[02:30:30]  moron for an hour oh yeah i'm like are you kidding me can i i can ask him anything right  they're like yeah you can ask him anything now i figure all right i'm going to be constructive i  want to be asked back to pierce morgan so what i i said and it'll air uh it'll air tonight on his  show i asked michael moore i said uh hey did you hear about this uh 71 year old concealed weapons  permit holder in florida where two thugs walked into the internet cafe one with a gun one with a bat  and he pulled out his gun and he went to town on these two guys guess what that would have been  the aurora colorado story potentially we were talking about had he not been there how do we 
[02:31:00]  know those thugs weren't going to kill everybody right and so here's my question mr moore what if  mr william samuels from miami florida had been at the midnight premiere of the dark night in aurora  colorado wouldn't it have turned out differently the answer is he's old he would have fallen asleep  he can't stay up to midnight i i've uh i've had debates with people especially uh limited to 140  characters on twitter about that and um a lot of people say oh so you want everyone in the theater 
[02:31:30]  to start shooting it's like no everyone in the theater isn't going to have a gun you have a couple  of people that would be you know responsible gun owners that are uh skilled in in using their gun  and they're going to be afraid to shoot none of us want to hit an innocent person no i'm a  concealed weapons permit holder the problem with the colorado thing and the problem with this argument  and pierce was raising it with some of his guests oh you're going to have people shooting in all  directions here's the big problem is that that theater had said no guns inside technically we're 
[02:32:00]  a gun-free business you're a private business i'm a capitalist i believe you can set the rules for  your private property that's fine but here's the deal if you're asking me to come in with my family  and to leave my weapons because it's never just one because as the seals say two is one one is none  so you always got to have a backup you're gonna have that drop piece you know you're gonna be the  cold piece well what am i he's got a gun he's got a gun but here's the problem with that gun-free  zone thing is that you're asking me to come into your movie theater and these guys i am i do not like 
[02:32:30]  this movie theater chain i'm really upset about this you're asking people law-abiding people to  respect your rule about your private property no guns okay i'm going to come in the duty and everybody  in that theater ought to sue the asses off of that theater chain to say you know what if i can't  bring my gun in if you're telling me no guns it's your responsibility to protect me you need to assure  that if i'm not bringing my gun in some crazy psycho is not bringing his in either so they were falling  down on the job you cannot say no guns and then say we're not going to make sure the guns don't get 
[02:33:00]  in yes it's like i don't want to go through the whole tsa grope and grin to get to see you know take  my kids to the new fantasia release but you know i don't want that tsa thing but at the end of the  day this is ridiculous all of these leftists who think we're going to put the gun laws in and blah  blah blah blah what's a criminal by definition a criminal doesn't obey the law they don't obey  the law it's just us it's not going to do anything could keep legislating against legal gun owners  making it more difficult uh for them just it it makes it easier for the them to uh prey on people 
[02:33:30]  because they know they're not armed that theater was devoid of of people that could defend themselves  against that guy and his weapon and there's people that i bet you in that theater that didn't bring  the gun in that were concealed carry oh my god imagine that and how many first responders were  represented in that theater let's see you had uh you had ems because there was a defibrillator in  the lobby and a first aid kit in the manager's office you had fire because there were fire  extinguishers sprinklers and exit signs the only first responder that wasn't represented there was the 
[02:34:00]  police you know there were people have a right to defend themselves and the leftists that say well  you have the right in your house well guess what i spend most of my time out of my house and i still  have a right to defend myself right i the listen criminals what is the old line when guns are outlawed  only outlaws will have guns i mean it's very it's very very true and so this thing about we should  make guns harder to get i have been telling every person that is anti-gun since the thing started  that this animal james holmes did not intend to shoot anybody that wasn't his intent 
[02:34:30]  they're like what are you talking about i'm like thanks for walking into the trap his intent wasn't  to shoot anybody his intent was to kill people and even the democrat governor of colorado said  it's not a gun issue the guy would have built bombs to kill people when people want to kill people  they've been doing it since man's been around cane and able they'll do it with sticks with knives  look at the brits some chucklehead in great britain because they got so many stabbings over there  decided i'm going to market a butcher knife with a rounded tip and see if i can get the government  to mandate that oh man it's insanity because people get stabbed in in record numbers over 
[02:35:00]  there yeah because they don't have any guns they just showed uh i guess they they uh put out some  information on uh jackass's apartment and uh grenades he he apparently had grenades in there  didn't he make his own grenades i think he i think they were homemade it all i saw was grenades  so i'm not sure from the media that has no idea even what semi-automatic means people like  oh it's a machine gun machine gun why did he why did he do that why did he obviously if he was 
[02:35:30]  killed he wanted everybody killed going into his apartment but why does he tell them i have a bomb  unless he wants his stuff saved in red why does he tell people there's bombs in his apartment i don't  get it that is a weird thing why not just enjoy the carnage if you're the joker yeah i don't get  that i do do we know for sure that he actually admitted the bombs were in there because i'm not  sure about that i wanted the cops the cops know to watch for this very careful it's one of the 
[02:36:00]  reasons that they were going through the window and taking a peek to see what they were up against  he's not the first guy i'm not sure he's trapped uh booby trapped an apartment this is really the  drug teams have to deal with this all the time because the meth houses are booby trapped and all  that kind of stuff so they've they don't they don't necessarily get the uh battering ram out and go  through the door right away so i don't know if they did the fiber you know did the snake under the  door or whatever but they've the police have learned some unfortunately some bad lessons with  guys that leave uh leave a little booby trap we haven't even talked about the new book there brad 
[02:36:30]  we want to sell a few books about my country and all this kind of stuff but thank you sure let's  talk about the book it's called blacklist yes it is tell us about it uh well blacklist came to me uh  from from two different areas i have been fascinated with the explosion of surveillance technology in the  u.s now like i said i am a straight arrow i'm one of the biggest law and order guys you're ever going  to meet but i think the government's growing too big and this total surveillance thing this total  information awareness thing has been bugging me for a while and i came across a quote uh senator frank 
[02:37:00]  church was on meet the press in august of 1975 and he said if the the giant listening years of the nsa  are ever turned inward on the united states he said that's it we will have crossed a surveillance  rubicon and if our government ever tilts towards tyranny it will be impossible for the american  citizens to launch a second revolution such as the capacity of the government to hear and know  everything that was freaking 75 wow now fast forward to 2012 the technology has exploded and i said okay 
[02:37:30]  this is great fodder for a book i think the surveillance system the the way that every single  thing 24 7 we're all being tracked if you are plugged into anything oh yeah you're being tracked your  cell phone we saw with onstar several months ago where even if you had stopped subscribing to the  onstar service they were still tracking where you were and selling the data amazing right it was a  big deal and now obama has asked the faa to clear the skies for drones and now the faa has said based  on what they're seeing out of the white house and everything we're going to have upwards of 30 
[02:38:00]  000 drones above the lower 48 in the next uh eight years just looking around huh yeah and the argument  i love from friends of mine is well if i'm not doing anything wrong they can read my emails and  by the way the nsa's giant listening years 9 11 was the event that made them turn inward and all of us  became suspects so now every email every text every phone call it's all being stored it's being sifted  it's being analyzed the the nsa's got so much data they outgrew their facility at fort mead maryland  they just spent two billion dollars to build a new one in utah and i said this is just a billion 
[02:38:30]  wow target rich environment as far as a thriller goes and you never hear about the nsa they're the  one you we don't know the icia you never know such agency never hear anything about the nsa two guys  with black suits mr norton would you come outside a moment please that's probably how it works because  you just never hear about them and what recourse do you have really i'm gonna get my lawyer who's  your supervisor i don't know i'm not even here right now talk to your boss what the only thing is 
[02:39:00]  and they have so much better technology than the public but the public has access to a decent  amount of technology it's obviously not what they have nsa gets every single thing first the minute  something comes out they grab it they take it apart they reverse engineer it uh it is it is very very  scary the tech and i thought okay you know my goal is i'm trying to do faction with my books where i  want people the the coolest email i get is from readers who say i actually have to read your book with 
[02:39:30]  my laptop open because i can't i can't tell where the facts end and the fishing begins and people  you know listen i'm an entertainer i want you to have a white knuckle edge of your seat thrill ride  but when you close the book if you close it saying god i learned a lot of stuff in this book and now i  want to i want to know some more about these things he's talking about then i think i've done my job as  an american does uh the bad guy die in the end uh it's yeah it's actually colonel mustard with a  candlestick holder in the library i hate to yeah spoiler we're not on the air right now are we that's 
[02:40:00]  okay right but you make me go to the last page you can you can start with any one of these books you  don't have to read them no you can start with any one of them you know i think uh i just became a  fan well thank you i didn't know much about you brad well it's okay i feel like i know you guys  because i listen to you in my car so this is this is fun for me do you do anything else besides right  it seems like you'd be uh great at doing a talk show podcast some other little thing i another  outlet don't do any of that i put my attention very interesting listen so if you get uh 11 is it 
[02:40:30]  bestsellers uh and this is my 12th so i hope that we're gonna get uh i guess you have to uh you know  put a few things aside did you really take a lot of time how long does it take you to write uh this  book i do one a year so uh yeah so it's a year how much downtime between books before you get back  into it you know i'm on book tour now and i'll take a couple weeks uh at the end of august when i'm off  tour be with my family go shoot some guns there you go uh we're working on you ever been hobbled by a  fan i'm your biggest fan yeah i have security i've got uh it sounds crazy but i mean as a creative 
[02:41:00]  person like i kind of understand the process but for me it's like i can it's hard to go okay i want  to write it i get bored with the subject so quickly like when you think of a story do you see the middle  and end of it or do you just go you know what nsa fuck and then yeah that's that's pretty much it  it's very it's very it grows it's very organic and i see it like kind of as a movie uh you know  unfolding by the way have you told these guys that you and i had met it was i did pierce morgan 
[02:41:30]  last year for the first time i did the red eye coming home it was on the red eye coming actually  i had to come here to do some tv stuff it was book tour last year and jim was sitting across from me  on the airplane and i'd watched him with colin quinn for years my wife and i were like oh jim norton's  not on we're not watching tonight that was always our thing everyone else had just the opposite  reaction no i met jeffrey ross about a year ago okay and uh he did a greg giraldo joke and everybody  and i didn't know it was like right after greg giraldo had passed i had no idea he'd passed and 
[02:42:00]  everybody's like oh and he's like too soon too soon like greg would have loved that yeah of course  so hey uh so the screenplay that uh they wrote for a movie correct based on your book did you get to  read the screenplay i did and i got happy with it but yeah they change it you know what i got i got a  great screenwriter this guy had been in the air force uh his brother-in-law was a marine in iraq  his dad had been in vietnam was a sheriff up in the pacific northwest really good guy he knew he  shoots he he gets it and that's that's rare to get in hollywood he did a great job and screenplay 
[02:42:30]  writing is obviously very different but you come across these authors and they go oh my god they  took my book i don't even recognize the movie hey once you sign the rights away they can turn it  into hitler on ice right there's nothing you can do right about it you just have to you know  as long as the check clears so you hope you pick the right person well you hope and that's why we  were so serious about not giving the rights to just anybody who came along because you want to go if  you have a great movie made it'll help sell books because they hollywood doesn't you would think for 
[02:43:00]  the amount of money they put into making the movie that the author gets like the huge payday  and it's it's not that way well the most famous one is stephen king right he seems to hate what other  people clancy has not been happy with the adaptation yeah clancy's not been happy who's  the other big one i mentioned i've never read his books patterson he's a is he have one character is  he a one character guy too or is he a bunch of different ones well the books that he writes  himself are the alex cross books and uh who is that morgan freeman plays alex cross in those movies 
[02:43:30]  but then patterson has got all of his co-authors which a lot of people are like well how do you feel  about the fact that patterson has got like patterson never leaves the new york times list because he puts a  book out like every two months with his co-writers and people like doesn't that piss you off that you  constantly have to compete with patterson and i said you know what the business of america's business  i love james patterson i think it's so freaking cool that he built a brand at the end of the day  it doesn't matter what i think about patterson it matters what his customers think and they love his  books yeah are they good do you like them i like a lot of patterson's books i don't read a ton of them  uh because i'm i'm reading other people in my genre there's so i'm trying to read people who are 
[02:44:00]  doing a lot of the counterterrorism stuff and that kind of a thing so but i do i read several  patterson books a year aren't you afraid like i'm always afraid i one of the reasons i don't read  is creatively i'm afraid of being influenced by other people like i don't want other people's  comedy or whatever sneaking into my so i only read things that are completely the opposite of what  that's unusual because i think a lot of great artists are influenced by people that came before  them right sure sure but i just don't want to just don't want to go down that road no i don't want to 
[02:44:30]  that's very rare i think i don't want to take anything from anybody else i'm very afraid of that  you know you don't want to ask you have to be careful listen first you can't be a great writer  without being a great reader that's really important you have to read probably excuse me  probably one of the worst uh i missed the cough button didn't i yeah that's all right we do it all  the time one of the uh one of the worst pieces of advice that young writers get is write what you  know and if that was true we would never have gotten clancy clancy was selling insurance at the  time jk rowling couldn't jet off to hogwarts i tell people write what you love to read because 
[02:45:00]  that's where your passion is and you've got a mini phd there because you've been reading in  that genre you know what works what doesn't work why your favorite author clunked on a particular  book why you like chapters a certain length but i read i try to read uh tons of people in my genre  because i i was a reader well before i was a writer it was my love of reading that made me want to be  an author but the harry potter books they're a bit overrated my kids love them my kids love them  i'm gonna get your mom is driving to summer camp right now and uh well she probably if the kids 
[02:45:30]  are in the car the show's not on yeah yeah yeah daddy uh i'm gonna have to put some money in that  little mayonnaise jar for all the bad language if the kids are listening when i get home do you like  stephen king i love him and i think he's gotten a bad rap i think he's a much better writer than a  lot of uh writing critics give him credit for like politically i don't like him but as an author  as an and you know what here's and i'll get it i'm taking it away but you know what i love the  richer these guys get the more they raise my taxes and blah blah blah when you've got more money than 
[02:46:00]  you can spend in a lifetime and your family's set then they want to lock the door and burn the house  down for the rest of us you know you're never going to get there i got mine you know whether  it's warren buffett or george soros you know there's even some guys on our side that i don't  want to piss anybody off but i hear them saying well i'd be willing to pay more taxes you know what  get the government under control and then let them spend less you know you made a fortune get  them under control get them under control and i'm still not going to pay more taxes yeah i don't  want to pay more taxes i want my right to get to the level that buffett's at yeah you know and for 
[02:46:30]  you to say i'm happy to pay more taxes it's always the guys that could burn money 24 7 and still be  rolling in the billions truer words have never been said yes get them under control first yep they  it's like secure the border it's not rocket science spending is out of control and they  have this unlimited why should they fix it when they have an unlimited supply of money pouring in  why would they want to fix it it's it just raise the tax yeah you know what they could raise the taxes 
[02:47:00]  and more money pours in hey this is great what could they do and what's our recourse go to jail  well yeah exactly don't you like that yeah you can't increase your own credit limit past a certain  point you can't print money right uh some people have tried the secret service shows up when you do  that you know what it what i had something very frightening happen to me i was in dc speaking  in front of a group people that make the biometric stuff software and the facial recognition technology  a lot of the stuff that gets clamped onto the drones it was a really fun talk that i got to go talk 
[02:47:30]  about blacklist the new book and say uh and they let me like let it all hang out i'm like hey guys  i think that the animal rights activists that used to go in and break into the laboratories to free  the animals and burn the buildings down that's nothing compared to the backlash you're going  to see people are physically going to come after your corporate board your ceos people are going to  be so pissed about the surveillance technology it's the next big pissed off thing the the right's going  to agree with the left on it we're all going to be like no way this isn't cool uh but then there  was a cocktail reception with members of congress up on the hill and i met a guy shook a couple hands 
[02:48:00]  they go take a vote and i stood there having a glass of wine with a guy and i won't say which  congressman he's the chief of staff for but i said let's talk about the debt and what's going to be  done and are the wheels going to come off the bus because he had a book that that i had recognized  that's a an interesting book because i'm i'm fascinated by are we going to default on the debt  what's the country look like blah blah blah blah this guy took me into his confidence and he points  towards where they're taking the vote and all the congress people are in there he says not a single  one of those assholes knows what to do this is a chief of staff he said they're only concerned about 
[02:48:30]  the next election right he said these dumb he called them assholes he said these dumb asses  do not have a plan they're all about the next election every single one of them only cares  about the next election they will kick the can down the road i i called my wife when i got out of  there i said i'm on the way back to the hotel i don't know whether to go down to the bar and get  hammered or go up to the room and throw up i said i think i'll do the bar first and then go up  i was i was physically sick to my stomach this is a chief of staff for a congressman telling me 
[02:49:00]  they have no plan they realize that there isn't enough austerity to get things back under control  and he looked at me and he said we're basically all effed yeah i'm like what yeah thanks for the  happy talk yeah but the guy was telling me the truth i gotta appreciate him shooting me straight  you probably should avoid washington yeah i would avoid it he probably actually was and the next thing  he did was go over to james patterson and go you should see what i just told  thor is gonna move to a remote cabin you'll never hear from him again he's never gonna write  another book so i got him out of your way jim we're going we're going to chicago actually uh 
[02:49:30]  august 10th to do a broadcast i'm gonna plug it because you're from chicago thank you 115 bourbon  street uh we're gonna be there probably from three o'clock on in the afternoon and um the oddest thing  you own you bring your stuff uh you know there's a cash prize chip off your block which is your dumb  chip impressions and your worst breath contest judged by our own eric hopefully he will vomit  and we're going to do something about the pig race matured what yeah we really are disgusting  but i don't know what to do in chicago like it's one of my favorite cities but it's like what else 
[02:50:00]  do we do besides i've never been so i gotta i just gotta check it out in general yeah i've never been  there and you're coming at a great time of year uh there is uh you guys are new yorkers so i know you  know pizza but i will give you a recommendation for the best thin crust pizza in the entire city  it is a new joint it's called uh mama milano's and it's on well street in old town mama milano's  mama milano's by the way the owner one of us good american oh i love this guy's restaurant and his 
[02:50:30]  pizza's just off the hook he's got pizzas i've never even seen before recipes fantastic so i really  really like it why don't you have the big uh chicago accent you know it's a good it's a good  question i don't know you know i can i can you know i can be like you know bears you know this is  good you know i tell the cops like yeah i'm gonna park my car here there's nothing you can  fucking do about it unless you bring dick out here okay because the only person i'm moving this car  for is dicka and my kids like to do that now without the f word my kids like to be uh dad the 
[02:51:00]  teacher gave us some homework and if i don't do it who am i more trouble with they would you fight  the teacher could we bring dick in and my kids can mimic the accent too i don't know i you know i live  downtown my dad uh was a marine no longer active and my mom worked for twa she used to live in new  york and fly new york paris paris new york back in the 60s the glamour days oh man and they were  big travelers so my parents didn't really have the accent so i guess that's why i don't have it  oh yeah okay yeah they were kind of nice right sitting around chicago what happened let me see i might 
[02:51:30]  i want to make sure we we always make sure our prep sheets are uh let's see here but did jimmy  find something did you find a problem so uh brad when when did you work for twa oh no i didn't  work for twa according to our prep sheet brad is a former twa flight attendant  how long i am yeah how long have those guys been out of business yeah i was like i was a prodigy  like stewie on family guy i used to roll the liquor cart up and down in my pampers i i knew that 
[02:52:00]  that wouldn't wasn't accurate but what dummy made up this list and got that you know that'll get a  guy's man card revoked i mean if you guys had teased the segment that way i mean i i uh wow  i'm gonna read blacklist i'll tell you right now i'm gonna read this damn thing i want to get back  in reading i'm gonna start with your book i used to read a lot i don't know what i hear that from  people a lot i hear people say you know what i never read after school i didn't like it but i  picked up one of your books i couldn't put it down all right you know my my wife gave it to me or my 
[02:52:30]  husband gave it to me and i started and you've for an author to hear from from readers you know what i  love reading again because your book the chapters were short they were fun that's that's the hugest  compliment you can be paid so i hope you i hope you enjoy going to read blacklist brad for here's  the guilty party right here sam what happened sam sam doesn't like being wrong why did you say that  he was a former twa flight attendant his biography on amazon is misleading oh well because if you start 
[02:53:00]  on sentence one and skip down to sentence eight in the middle and yeah perhaps let's see how  misleading is let's see uh sam let's see of a u.s marine and a twa flight attendant  see yeah it says as the son of a u.s state a united states marine and a former twa flight  attendant the son of and right so i wrote in the prep sheet he's the son of a united states marine and  he is a former yeah why would you write why would you write he is a instead of the son of a because

[02:59:00]  they all three of them did a really good job and uh i don't know it was funny i can't i never wanted  to say that i'm gonna watch it tonight i never wanted to have to say that a movie that i've torn  apart and said this sucked was actually kind of funny but the only reason we said all that was we  were kind of pissed off we get pissed off when they redo comedies yeah or redo uh characters even 
[02:59:30]  oh my god the r.i.p you're gonna kill the past you uh what happened anthony this isn't you  oh no you're gonna watch that honeymooners remake i was just gonna say god i was literally just gonna  say that no you're fired for stealing my idea you're fired you're fired you're fired  no you're fired all right and some of that shit like they slam each other in the fucking head with  a sledgehammer pretty goddamn funny why are we having curtis stone on he's right outside the studio 
[03:00:00]  i don't know roland just started freaking out when he saw curtis stone and he's the naked chef  he's the chef dude that the women want to fuck oh that's the take-home chef is he naked he does  no he's wearing clothes he does spots on uh the biggest loser and uh well he was on are you a big  fan of his he no well why is roland why is roland thought it was funny a lot of weird shit happening  in the last few minutes here roland just uh instagrammed he's uh rolandos 99 on uh instagram 
[03:00:30]  yes rolando uh right sam roberts with his hero chef curtis stone and look look i don't have a hero  but sam posed oh yes in studio posing for a picture with curtis stone who's outside the studio  and doesn't even know his picture is being taken that's great because i think he did know his  picture is being taken and i just wanted it to be awkward but no i only thing that he's not a fan  of his know him from is america's next great restaurant which travis and i watched that reality  show we're the only two from start to finish we did not give up on it it was so close to 
[03:01:00]  cancellation but we didn't give up on it wow so oh god is that awful when edgar pitches your arm  and sold eddie one yeah restaurant the reason you've never heard of it is because within three  months of winning the reality show it was opened and out of business oh really wow he also had a  show called take home chef so what is he doing out there it's just hanging out what's he waiting  for should we get him in here i wouldn't know what to ask him i wouldn't either he's talking about 
[03:01:30]  what do you think i should do with a motherfucking baguette  hey what do i do if i want to make two apples into something oranges all right and i'm i'm gonna  watch um three stooges homework assignment for people we'll discuss the movie tomorrow now did  you enjoy the old stooges did you enjoy okay i didn't know that by that he means the accent  management  and i enjoyed the shit what is it and i enjoyed the current stooges yeah down the hall it's it's 
[03:02:00]  really i don't know they really captured they kind of like take it seriously or were they goofing  on the fact they were the three stooges no it was how they twist it sometimes i don't mind when  they twist some shit no it was very goofy it was goofy apology for the movie and makers um well i don't  know if i need to do that i think larry david was uh the uh the head nun right and uh that was  pretty funny gave it a little bit of credibility because larry is a funny dude man and if he's a 
[03:02:30]  part of it exactly i wonder if he's a producer it wasn't bad and the trailer didn't do it justice  damn that's pretty brave i must say the trailer didn't do it justice pretty fucking brave i found  it funny you ripped the trailer apart i really did you probably cost the movie oh no oh did i  do you do it on another show oh no oh here did you laugh at that part when the baby poked the  nun no i saw it in the trailer they're babies but they already have their hair that's and they 
[03:03:00]  really don't awful and i don't know i'll watch tonight i'm gonna watch i don't know it's it's  i have heard that they did the characters well they did the characters very well  did you laugh at that part no i don't see in trailer form it's not good  and curly  were you really drunk last night no so you can't blame it on that you just really liked it

[03:04:00]  get through this iron door and they picked up curly and started using his head like a battering ram  and they showed it from above and his head was literally crushing as they were because it had to  be some kind of a a rubber head i see why you like this movie uh the jersey shore kids you love those  jersey shore kids no that was the part where i was kind of like why are they doing this you love the  situation that'll make it unrewatchable you know the jersey shore kids were in it yeah
