<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated discussion about the Nassau County vote on a new arena for the New York Islanders. Opie vehemently opposed the use of taxpayer money, citing the county's $100 million deficit, while Anthony, despite being an Islanders fan, agreed with Opie's concerns. The vote ultimately failed 57-43.  This was followed by a bizarre, nonsensical phone call with Kenny from Wisconsin, rambling about a fictional "bump" in the federal budget.  Next, a caller, "Troy," claimed to have lost a leg in Iraq, a story riddled with inconsistencies that the hosts quickly debunked.  The show then played audio clips of the late "Mickey J," the self-proclaimed "Mayor of Montauk," followed by a caller, Richard, sharing anecdotes about Mickey J's eccentric life and death by drowning. Opie concluded this section with a story about a negative experience at a polling place, which segued into a discussion about his use of racial slurs while driving, Andrew Dice Clay's parenting advice, Kevin Smith's birthday, and a musical interlude featuring MGMT.

The show transitioned to a segment focusing on MTV's early days and its initial video rotation. The hosts, along with callers, debated the first music videos aired on MTV, eventually agreeing on "Video Killed the Radio Star."  This led to discussions about various 70s and 80s artists, including harsh criticisms of Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks, while praising some Fleetwood Mac songs.  Elvis Costello and Lou Reed’s status as “overrated” was also debated at length.  The hosts and callers also engaged in sexually explicit comments about photos of the original MTV VJs. A listener’s story about a bank robbery with a bomb collar led to a discussion of Danny McBride's new movie, "30 Minutes or Less."  This transitioned into an in-studio interview with Danny McBride, where he discussed the film, his working relationship with other actors, "Eastbound and Down," the bank robbery story, rumors about replacing Steve Carell in "The Office," and a Beastie Boys music video he was in.

The next segment heavily featured Danny McBride, further discussing "30 Minutes or Less," including filming in ape costumes and the challenges of wearing the masks.  He also discussed his ambivalence towards successful comedic actors.  The conversation shifted to one of the hosts' upcoming fatherhood, including humorous anecdotes about choosing a baby name and experiencing the baby's movement in the womb. McBride then discussed his edgy Case Swiss commercial campaign and his preference for R-rated and X-rated comedies. This was followed by a prolonged, expletive-laden segment about Sam Roberts' ongoing, on-air campaign for a raise at SiriusXM, involving increasingly ridiculous "production pieces." The segment concluded with plans to escalate Sam's campaign, the show's break, the "F U" segment, an Andy Rooney parody, and a sarcastic discussion of Kings of Leon and Caleb Followill's health issues.

The show continued with a discussion about paparazzi and celebrities, quickly transitioning into a racist exchange using offensive racial slurs. A news story about a man arrested for having "more pussy than he can handle" was discussed, along with a Dunkin' Donuts employee arrested for prostitution, using a donut-related code word. This led to further sexually explicit jokes and discussions.  Listeners called in describing medical anomalies, and the hosts analyzed a woman's angry outburst on a bus. The latter half of this segment focused heavily on the upcoming guest list, including Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, Michael Ian Black, and Guy Fieri, with discussions about the logistics of Fieri's cooking segment.  The segment also included discussions of Sam Roberts' other radio work and an anecdote about Anthony's former mother-in-law.

The final segment centered on the logistics for an upcoming "Couch of Zilch's" segment, detailing the entry process via Facebook.  This was followed by an unplanned, awkward in-studio interview with the original MTV VJs, conducted by Roland after Opie and Anthony unexpectedly left for vacation.  The hosts later humorously criticized Roland's hosting and the VJs’ reactions. Ron Bennington briefly appeared before the show transitioned to another segment, hinting at the possibility of Virginia Madsen as a guest.

[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a bit of a minute.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning.  Hi.  Going to get into this Coliseum thing, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I guess we got to set the table for everybody around the country.  Around the country.  There's a little hockey team called the New York Islanders.  They play on Long Island.  May have heard about them, you know, back in the early, mid-80s.  All right, slow down.  Some of us still know who they are. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  And they play at this shithole called the Nassau Coliseum, which is very, very outdated.  I think it's outdated by at least 10 years at this point.  Yeah.  Because I've gone to enough arenas to watch hockey, and it's not even close to what is going on elsewhere around the league.  And it was tied to vote on a new arena.  Yep.  And a lot of people just blew it.  Yeah.  Yeah, the vote came in, and no arena for the New York Islanders at this point in time. 
[00:05:00]  I was victorious.  You were victorious.  Yeah, I voted.  I voted a resounding no.  You don't like me that much that you had to fucking vote no for hockey.  It had nothing to do with you.  Knowing how much I like my Islanders.  Well, P, it had nothing to do with you.  It's for everyone's own good.  Well.  It's for everyone's own good.  Believe me, the Islanders will not leave.  A Coliseum, a new sporting complex over there, will be built. 
[00:05:30]  It just will not be done with taxpayer money.  That's it.  And this pushed their fucking, it made them rethink it and push their hand.  Now they have to come up with an option.  I got to say this.  They set it up horribly.  Yeah.  I was telling you just before the show, okay, they want a new arena for hockey.  But if you're not an Islanders fan, why the fuck would you go out and vote yes?  Well, because people will say it's good for the economy and it'll be helping you out in the long run. 
[00:06:00]  But people are like blah, blah, blah to that.  Exactly.  Why didn't they sell it this way besides hockey, concerts, minor league team, and I don't know, maybe add some other things to that area where people outside hockey would go, wow, that's kind of cool for Nassau County and Long Island.  I'm going to vote yes for this.  They focus so much on the Islanders, Islanders, Islanders, Islanders need a new place that if you're not a hockey fan, why would you fucking vote yes for this thing? 
[00:06:30]  Well, let me tell you something, as I was told by a few Twitters last night, I am an uninformed asshole.  You were taking on the world last night.  Yet, yeah, yet I've done probably more research on this than any of these idiots that when I see you're an uninformed asshole, I click on their fucking Twitter account, I look at their posts, all their tweets, 90% of them are hockey tweets. 
[00:07:00]  They're all like amazing Islanders fans, Islander fans.  And, of course, they want the vote, but I am doing it based on economics and what we rail against here on a daily basis.  Do you idiots that would give me shit about my no vote last night, do you listen to this show?  Because we rail against the fact that we're taxed, and then the people that have our tax money don't know what the fuck to do with it except waste it. 
[00:07:30]  So now I'm supposed to say yes to $400 million to hand over to a government agency and think they're going to spend it wisely, responsibly, economically, and build something that will work and make money under a government contract?  Fuck you!  Let them fucking deal with this privately.  And I know what you're going to say, Wang, good old Wang that owns the fucking team and is leasing the Coliseum and the property around it, doesn't own the property. 
[00:08:00]  So he can't just go in with his billions and build a Coliseum.  I understand that whole part.  The Republicans and Mangano was one of them that said, no, you can't do this on your own.  It's our land.  Well, now, you know what?  We pushed their hand, and now they're going to have to come up with an option.  And it's in the Republicans' fucking court to now come up with private funding and allow private enterprise to build this facility. 
[00:08:30]  I do not trust the government with my money.  They can't run the TSA.  They can't run the fucking MTA.  They can't build anything that makes money.  They lost the OTB, which is a bookie fucking agency.  Nothing they do is right.  We talk about it every day on this show.  Yet I am supposed to vote yes to hand them $400 million and think they're going to do the right thing? 
[00:09:00]  Blow me.  That's why I voted no.  It's a mess.  So what happens now?  Now, Mangano is even saying, well, there's other options on the table we're looking at.  Oh, really?  Where was that before the vote?  What are the options, though?  I don't know.  He said he's working on them.  Because, I mean...  It's private enterprise.  Private investors.  The Islanders have to stay in that shithole until 2015.  2015.  And if the vote went through yesterday, they would pretty much start building the damn thing today.  Oh, yeah.  Because they fucking want out of that shithole so bad.  So now it just sits there for another, what, three, four years? 
[00:09:30]  Unless they come up with some kind of deal to get private investors...  On the same land?  And Wang.  Well, wherever it's going to be.  Is the county going to allow that now that they don't have a taste?  Well, that's just it.  Maybe they could work out something with a private enterprise and a private builder and fucking billionaire Wang.  It's his shit.  If he wants it, I think he should get together with the county and work out a deal where, yeah, he can fucking pay for the shit and reap the rewards. 
[00:10:00]  How close was the vote?  57-43.  Oh, a 43.  I mean, I was torn because, obviously, I'm a huge hockey fan, a huge Islanders fan.  I've hung in there for many, many years.  But I'm with you with the whole tax fucking thing and not trusting the government anymore.  I don't trust politicians or the government in general any fucking more.  I was reading in the paper today, you talk about how Nassau County has the highest taxes pretty much on the country. 
[00:10:30]  We're very close.  It is.  There's a $100 million deficit.  Yeah.  How the fuck is that possible?  You can't figure that out?  And no one talks about this.  No one talks about it.  You're paying the most taxes, but there's a $100 million deficit.  And that's what I was going to say when you mentioned, why didn't they bring up more than just hockey?  Why didn't they talk about other things that go on and probably bring other people in that would have voted yes?  They could say, Jesus Christ is coming to the Nassau Coliseum to return. 
[00:11:00]  They still wouldn't have gotten it because if the people of Nassau County that did vote no  would have had more confidence and faith in the government and the way they spend their money, they would have voted yes.  I would have voted yes.  I understand economics.  I understand you need an infrastructure which includes things like arenas and entertainment complexes to make money.  No one was telling me anything I didn't fucking know last night.  They're talking to me like, you don't understand. 
[00:11:30]  It brings in jobs.  It had nothing to do with it.  What my biggest issue was is I watched them fucking squander our tax money for years and waste and redundancies and bullshit.  And then I was supposed to go in when asked to vote and like a sheep vote yes?  Fuck you.  No.  $100 million deficit.  Not another penny.  And you also know, because we've been around long enough, that $400 million doesn't mean it's going to be $400 million. 
[00:12:00]  No.  They said probably $9 million after interest.  Huh?  They said probably $900 million after everything is said and done.  So they're saying $400 but possibly as high as $900?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was another thing.  The $400 million.  And then I got the people saying, you know, it only amounts to $13 per person per year.  You can't foot that, you rich fuck.  And all I was saying with that was $13.  You know what then?  Out of all the fucking tens of thousands of dollars in tax money I pay a year to the county, find $13 that I already give you, take it from somewhere else and put it toward the Coliseum. 
[00:12:30]  It's hard there.  It's hard to disagree with you, and I'm a fan, man.  I've had it.  It's hard to disagree with you.  But their strategy was horrible, too.  It was.  You know, we were talking about it yesterday.  The Rangers fans.  Yeah.  They were all voting, though, like lunatics.  Yeah, like, fuck that.  So all the Ranger fans that live in Nassau County are like, well, this is our chance to fuck the Islanders because we hate each other. 
[00:13:00]  So the strategy in general was stupid.  The turnout, very sparse.  It was like, what, 10% of the county, I think?  Yeah.  I read.  $13.  $89,000 people voted.  That's it.  You know what?  For $13, let me tell you what I want.  I'll buy some fucking blacktop, and one of these idiots can fill a pothole I hit every fucking day on the parkway.  There.  I'd rather my $13 go to that out of my fucking thousands upon thousands of tax money I pay. 
[00:13:30]  But you pay a lot of taxes.  You should have a road that's paved with gold, my friend.  Gold!  At this point.  Yes!  God, I didn't give a fuck about politics growing up, but now it just infuriates me.  It is infuriating.  The politicians and the government just infuriate me.  It's ridiculous.  Well, they would waste the money and not care because it's not their money.  That's just it.  It's not their money.  They'd waste it.  And do you think if money starts pouring in and all that tax money and revenue that they're talking about, they start getting, do you think we'll get some kind of a check? 
[00:14:00]  Like, hey, remember that vote you did years ago?  Well, we finished the project.  We're making some money.  Here you go, guys.  Here's a refund check.  Or, we're using that extra revenue to do something for the citizens.  We're going to, you know, fill all those potholes.  We're going to do that.  Nothing gets done because they're a bunch of fucking crooks.  You got Kenny in Wisconsin.  Kenny!  Wisconsin?  You have nothing to do with this vote that happened yesterday, sir.  Go ahead, sir.  I'll listen. 
[00:14:30]  I'm game.  Kenny?  Hello?  Wisconsin?  Hello?  Hi.  What's up, sir?  What's up, Kenny?  Where's Kenny at?  I'm right here, sir.  Where do you think he is?  He's in the other room.  I'm sitting right here.  What's up?  What are you talking about?  You stupid punk.  I love this guy.  What am I talking about?  Yeah.  I think we explained it quite thoroughly.  Well, you're not going to get the bump anymore anymore. 
[00:15:00]  They said they gave me the reprieve.  You're not going to get charged for anything.  But Opie's going to get charged for it.  Oh, wow.  We got a winner.  Kenny, what's going on, brother?  What's going on?  Well, you're not going to get the bump, but Opie's going to get the bump.  What bump am I getting?  This sounds cool.  Want to do a bump? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, we're doing bumps?  What year is this?  I know.  You know, it's 2012.  They got their one trillion.  So it carries them to 2012.  That makes Obama good.  Holy shit.  You know how this sounds like.  I know it sounds like way back in the old BAB days.  Mickey J.  Mickey J.  The blood is true.  There's probably five people that know what I'm talking about right now.  But way, way, way back.  OJ did it.  The blood is true. 
[00:16:00]  Do we have any Mickey J?  If you can find Mickey J today.  I'll, I'll, I'll.  You're not getting the bump.  You're going to get the bump after 2012.  The bump.  What bump is he going to get after 2012?  I have to get one bit of logic out of you.  You're going to, you're going to get the whole tax back bracket right that bump after 2012.  All right.  So why do I get the bump?  I told you that.  You got the one trillion. 
[00:16:30]  But, but why do I get the bump and Ant doesn't get the bump?  Am I special?  Yeah.  Why don't I get no bump?  Why isn't Ant getting no bump?  And does Jim Norton get a bump?  No, but no, no.  It's no, you're not getting the bump, but it's, it's going to carry on after 2012.  Hey, Kenny, who's getting the bump?  Am I getting the bump?  Yeah, you're going to get the bump.  This guy's talking about, I think he's talking about the budget, the federal budget.  Right.  I'm talking about a county vote, and he has no clue. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, who cares about that?  Who cares?  Coliseum, this thing's way better right now.  Oh, yeah.  Kenny, walk us through this.  Who's going to get the bump?  I get the bump and Ant doesn't get the bump.  Who else gets the bump?  No, nobody's going to get the bump now until 2012.  Okay, let's make believe it's 2000, let's make believe it's 2012.  I get the bump, who else gets the bump?  Well, Ant, I'm sorry, but you got all kind of cash, so you're going to get the bump then. 
[00:17:30]  So you get the bump too?  I'm getting the bump.  Oh, nice.  The bump is bad though, I'm thinking.  Now I'm starting to think.  You're going to have to pay your dues.  What?  After 2012, you're going to have to pay your dues.  It sucks for you, Ant.  Why am I going to have to pay my dues?  Because after 2012, you're going to have to pay the bump, and it's going to come right  on you. 
[00:18:00]  Guess who?  Guess who?  Who's making all the cash?  Who's making all the cash?  You're going to get the bump.  It makes all the cash.  All the cash.  I hide my shit.  I don't make no cash.  On paper, I look like I have no money.  I think you're a blithering idiot, Kenny.  Oh, you can say idiot.  I think you're, no, I said, I think you're a blithering idiot.  Well, let's ask Kenny this.  Kenny, do you get the bump?  Obama just, he just made it, he made it, they just gave him the one point trillion dollars. 
[00:18:30]  One point trillion.  Yeah, but you're not factoring in, you're not factoring in, no, no, you're not factoring  in the fiscal bump.  First of all, it was, it was cuts.  It was cuts for the, for the trillion, not, not revenue, sir.  Come on, dude, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're not being realistic.  That's true.  More importantly, get Troy in here. 
[00:19:00]  I guess this guy's trying to give nuts.  Troy wants to kill somebody.  Where's Troy?  Bring him in.  You're going to get your cash after 2012.  As of 2012?  They're going to get my cash?  They're going to come to me.  You know why?  Because I'm fucking, I'm fucking disabled.  Oh, you're disabled.  All your money's going to come to me.  Troy.  Oh, that's a shame.  I, I got word that this guy's been driving you nuts, huh?  Well, this is what I deal with every day.  Why do you think I'm ready to go on a fucking homicidal rage? 
[00:19:30]  You know why?  Does he call you every day?  No, he doesn't call you every day, but he's just.  But this is the shit you got to put through immediately.  This, this stuff is gold.  Hey, man, give me your cash.  How, he wants your cash.  How, how are you, how are you disabled, sir?  Please tell me.  Who, me?  Yeah.  I lost a leg in, in, in, in, uh, Iraq.  You lost a leg in Iraq?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Where?  What happened?  I got one of them fucking little hippie yappy beans.  What happened?  Tell me what happened.  Iraq.  Yeah, I, I, I, I, I...  Yeah, well, you can, you don't just go to Iraq and, and your, your leg falls off.  Give me some details.  I like war stories.  No, I, I, I lost my leg from, uh, a fucking, uh, explosive people.  Well, give me the circumstances.  You're still gonna, you're still gonna give it to me.  I just want to know the circumstances.  What were you doing when, uh, the explosive went off? 
[00:20:30]  Oh, I was in, in my Humvee.  You're in your Humvee.  Where?  What were you doing?  Driving?  Were you a gunner?  No, I wasn't a gunner.  What were you doing in the Humvee?  I was just riding there, shotgun.  Uh-huh.  And where was...  When an M60, when an M60 strapped to my fucking back.  You had an M60, wait, wait, you had an M60 strapped to your back. 
[00:21:00]  Is that possible?  I don't even know.  And, uh, well, it's, it's a little, it's a little big.  An M60 strapped to my back.  I was ready to rock, lock, cock, rock, and ready to rock.  And I fucking had my fucking leg blown off.  What, sir, what city were you in in Iraq?  Before.  You know, you know, you know what the last time they used an M60 was? 
[00:21:30]  You sure you weren't in the NAM?  No, I'm not talking about NAM.  I'm talking about right here, right, man.  Is this Lieutenant Dan?  I was in the shit, man.  You were in the shit.  I love it.  I was in the shit, man.  Is he telling the truth?  I don't think so.  Sir, are you, are you, are you fibbing?  Yeah, I'm not talking about something.  Hey, uh, Kenny, a lot of people are saying that, uh, you're lying.  What division?  Give me, give me, uh, what division you were in. 
[00:22:00]  The 33rd what?  What, what, what were you in?  33rd division in Iraq.  Dufar.  What is that?  Infantry?  Armor?  What is it?  In Dufar.  33rd division.  In Dufar?  Yeah.  Isn't Dufar in Africa?  Come on, man.  In Dufar, no.  Yeah, that's in the sedan, right?  Or Darfur.  Darfur.  Dufar.  Come on, man.  You gotta, you gotta, you gotta put your things on. 
[00:22:30]  I gotta put my things on.  You gotta play the piper, man.  You were gonna have to play the piper.  I already did it.  I've been there, done that.  Come on, man.  You weren't even there, man.  I know.  I don't think you were either.  You gotta come up with another number than the 33rd.  Because there, there really isn't.  33rd didn't do far yet.  That's where we're at.  Yeah?  The 33rd?  But how'd you lose your leg?  You really haven't explained that, Kenny.  What was, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And a lot of people think you're just making all this up.  What was your MOS?  I just told you I fucking got hit by a fucking eye.  No.  What was, what was your job?  What did you do?  What do you mean what I do?  What was your job?  Most people have a military occupational specialty.  Yeah, I was right there in the shit, man.  What did you do?  What was your training?  What, what, what did you do? 
[00:23:30]  I just told you I was right there in the...  No one's ever asked him a follow-up question.  No, no one's ever asked him a follow-up question.  Fucking rules.  All right, Kenny.  What did you do in Iraq when you lost your leg?  Were you in communications?  Were you in infantry?  Were you in armor?  Were you, what did you do?  Eddie, I just told you, man.  I just fucking... 
[00:24:00]  I was in the shit.  He's in the shit.  I think he's lying, right?  I think he's lying.  Yeah, I think he's fibbing.  Why would you make that up?  Yeah, why make that up?  Come on.  A lot of people think you're lying, Kenny.  Why would I, why would I lie about something?  A lot of people think you're lying, that you weren't in the shit, and that you didn't  even lose your leg.  Yeah, well, I have a little fucking like a, a pin thing, pin job. 
[00:24:30]  I have nothing I just said.  You had a pin job?  We believe that you lost your leg, sir, but you probably, did you lose it some other way?  Was it a car accident, or a motorcycle, or something?  Perhaps you were drinking for a few hours.  No, it's an IE.  It's an IE?  All right, sir.  Wasn't IED the term?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're forgetting the D, sir.  Yeah, that's for drunk.  How many years ago did that happen? 
[00:25:00]  A year and a half ago.  A year and a half ago.  A year in Iraq, yeah.  A year and a half ago in Iraq, huh?  How old a guy are you?  41.  All right.  And you were a reservist?  Come on, man.  What?  Man.  Don't go there.  Hey.  Don't go there.  They got their 120, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, 
[00:25:30]  you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're  good.  I love this guy.  Don't go there, that's basic NFL.  Don't go there.  I was just saying that's a little, yeah, what'd you get up to in the service?  Oh, good question, yes.  What were you?  Second grade.  What?  Second grade.  Second grade.  Yeah.  I made the second grade, yeah.  You made the second grade.  I made second grade, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  So what does that make you?  What do you think that makes me?  If I had my fucking leg blown off.  I don't know.  I don't know what it makes you.  You're not telling me what your job was.  Yeah.  You're not telling me what you did.  What did you do?  Basic infantry.  Everything.  Hey.  What branch of the military were you in?  Army, Marines?  What the fuck are you talking about? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but what were you?  Were you Army or Marines?  What were you?  Air Force.  Navy.  Navy.  Second grade Army.  Second grade Army.  What rank were you?  Second grade Army.  What rank?  Second grade Army, yeah.  In the 33rd?  Losing them?  Oh, boy.  Kenny?  Yeah.  Kenny, what rank were you?  Three.  Losing them.  Yeah.  The alcohol is probably melting us in his throat. 
[00:27:00]  Kenny.  Yeah.  We're kind of losing you.  You have bad cell service.  Maybe the government is tapping your line.  That's it.  He's done.  So he says he's a second grade.  All I can think is an E2, which is a private.  If you're a 40-year-old private.  Yeah.  Wow.  We found it.  There's a guy way the fuck back.  This goes back like 15 years or so.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  There was a guy.  He was called the mayor of Montauk.  His name was Mickey J.  I fucking love this guy.  He called on a regular basis.  He's no longer with us.  No surprise there.  You got a little taste of audio from Mickey J?  That guy reminds me of Mickey J.  He's drunk.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He sounds almost exactly like this guy.  Hit.  Yo, BAB.  Hey, kiddo.  How you doing?  Mickey J.  Yeah.  What's happening?  The mayor of Montauk.  How are you, bro?  Uh, what do you think about the OJ now, man? 
[00:28:00]  The DNA came in and said his blood is true.  His blood is true?  Yeah.  It's his blood.  What do you mean his blood is true?  Well, they said with their DNA, they said it's his blood that was on the path of his health  there.  Yeah.  You better find some good drugs, OJ.  Don't fool yourself, boys, going up your poop tube. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, what was that line again?  Don't fool yourself, boys, going up your poop tube.  Hey, tell Rocco, save me a piece of pizza when he comes out this weekend.  Who's Rocco?  Your buddy's there, right?  They ordered a pizza.  Hey, it's Rocco's pizza.  Well, that would be Rocco, but close enough, bro.  You want to sing a song tonight, buddy?  Well, how about a little Zeppelin?  Rocco wants to play while you sing.  Okay, go, man, go.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  Which one do you want to sing?  Good times, bad times?  Yeah, there you go.  All right, whenever you're ready, bro.  Okay, go, man, go.  In my days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man.  Now, by the time's now, you know I'm behind my chair.  When a woman comes around again, I don't seem to care. 
[00:29:30]  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  That'll be Nicky J.  Same guy, right?  The blood is true.  Go, man, go.  Go, man, go.  What do you think he died of?  Actually, I don't even know.  I think he might have drowned.  Really?  Might have had a few too many and went into the surf.  When did he die?  I remember that being talked about.  Fuck, that's years ago.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Long time.  I don't even think it was a long day trial.  So it was right.  That's from 94, I guess.  Wow.  Yeah.  17 years.  So anyway, you went and voted.  You said you had an experience voting for the Coliseum thing, too.  Yes, yes, I went to my polling place in school.  And right when I walk in, there's tables set up.  First of all, I walk in and they all look at me like, oh, finally, someone's here. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, God.  Like, turnout was ridiculously low.  The weather on Long Island last night was crazy, and yesterday afternoon.  So it really, I think that cut down a lot.  Doesn't that show you, though, half a billion dollars at stake and only 10% show up?  Yeah, yeah.  People just don't give a shit.  They really don't.  Half a billion.  And that's why the government gets to do whatever the fuck they want.  I know.  That's what it comes down to.  You're absolutely right.  You're sitting home, and there's a half a billion dollars on the line. 
[00:31:00]  You don't give a fuck enough to voice your opinion on it.  You're right.  Now, I've reached the point now, and I wasn't like this years ago.  I would complain about a lot of shit, but I do vote on everything that's up for vote.  All these referendums and stuff, I will go out and vote if it concerns me.  And if I get blown out or the vote wins, whatever, but at least I, you know, I feel better about  it if I actually went out and did it.  So I go there to the polling place, and there's fucking tables lined up, and they have their 
[00:31:30]  little books out, and they go, what's your address?  So I give them my address, and the woman's looking at her book.  She goes, oh, I think it's the end table.  And she yells over to the woman at the end table.  The end table?  The end table.  Oh, the end table, yes.  Oh, there we go.  But the end table was kind of a table where there was, there were all white people in  there, except for the one end table. 
[00:32:00]  It was a...  It was very any?  Very rotund black woman with her head leaning on her hand, and it looked like, mm-hmm, just  sitting there, very... didn't look like she wanted to be there at all.  At all.  Which, you know, that's fine.  But, you know, do your job.  So I go over to that side, and she's not doing anything.  And one of the women goes, would you look to see if his address is in there? 
[00:32:30]  And gave out the address again.  And she starts, don't yell at me!  Who are you to yell at me?  To one of the other polling women.  So now I'm standing there all uncomfortable, and now she's mumbling under her breath.  As I'm standing in front of the table, not looking through the books, she's like, yell  at me.  I don't need that shit from her.  I don't need that shit from you.  No, no, you don't yell at me. 
[00:33:00]  Jesus.  And then I go, could you open the book and look for my name?  I said, I'd love to, you know, hang around for this whole thing, but, you know, I got  a vote to make, and then I want to get out of here.  And now she's looking at me like, fuck you.  But she's got to look through the book, and she goes, mm, here, sign, flips the book around  like a fucking cunt at me, and pretty much throws the pen at me. 
[00:33:30]  And I went under my breath.  I was like, really?  Really?  And signed it, and like flipped the pen back at her.  And one of the guys said, okay, here's your ballot.  Go over there.  And he walks up to me, he goes, ah, sorry, sorry, I had to fucking deal with that.  I'm sorry about that.  I go, nah, believe me.  I get it.  And made my little vote.  But it's like, you know, everyone else in the place was very helpful and nice. 
[00:34:00]  And she's just there, fucking miserable, yelling at somebody, fucking, and the woman wasn't  even yelling.  She just, because she's across the room, she goes, could you look for his address?  Because she wasn't doing anything.  Yell at me!  And I'm just, I'm just fucking disgusted.  I left there, I left there, I get into my car, and the first thing I have to do is  yell fucking, ah, ah, ah, I did, it was the first words out of my fucking mouth. 
[00:34:30]  It really is refreshing, isn't it, to yell that out?  Oh, it is.  And it wasn't me.  It isn't my fucking blatant racism that made me yell that out.  If there was a nice woman there, and she happened to be African-American and was cordial as I was voting,  I never would have gotten out in my car and fucking said that or thought that.  But that whole attitude makes white people go into their car and roll the windows up, look around, and yell the word out.  I don't understand black women with a little power. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, stop it.  Black women with a little power, they are very dangerous.  I said the word because she was being the word.  Sorry.  That's when you say the word, only when they're being the word.  If she was a white woman, I'd have fucking gotten out in the car, I'd have shut my door and went fucking cunt.  Yeah, she would have been a fucking cunt.  So how come the black lady wasn't a fucking cunt?  Well, because to a white woman, the c-word, it's calling her a cunt, is the worst thing you can do. 
[00:35:30]  What am I going to say?  Hey, honky?  Hey, bitch?  It's the worst thing you do.  When someone treats me like that, I only want to fucking say the worst possible thing I can say.  Makes sense.  And to black people, nigger seems to be the worst fucking thing you could say.  Yeah, it's a rough one.  And that's, but that's basic human nature to want to strike back at somebody in the worst way possible when they treat you like shit.  Like if she was a fat white lady, but she was in a wheelchair, you would have gotten in the car and went, you fucking fat cripple.  You fucking gimpy cunt. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  Fucking, I hope someone wheels you off a cliff.  Right.  It's the worst thing you can think or say.  Yes.  Understand.  And it's basic human nature to, you don't, when you are treated like shit, I don't care how liberal or dumb fucking you are.  When you're treated like shit by somebody, you will find the one thing that is the atomic bomb for them and drop it.  Now, I didn't do it to her face because I don't want a racial incident with me at a voting place.  So, you know, I don't normally do that. 
[00:36:30]  As I wouldn't have called a white woman a cunt to her face.  Sometimes I have while I'm driving.  But then again, I've yelled out the bad N word.  But it's just one of those things.  It's basic human nature.  I think if you say you never thought it, you're being very dishonest.  What is up with Sassy Blackweaver, though, that have a little power?  I don't know.  But she wanted nothing to do with that white woman yelling at her as she's sitting there with her head in her hand, not even looking through the fucking book. 
[00:37:00]  I'm one voter.  Believe me, there wasn't a line of people with her going, oh, fuck, it's going to be a busy night.  I walked in there to an echo and I was in her book and she had to wait there like that.  Fuck her.  I was on stage the other night and there was a table of black women up front stage left.  And they were not talking or disrespectful, but just the fucking faces on them. 
[00:37:30]  I never, black people in crowds in groups don't like me.  Like as a couple, a couple will.  Like, you know, if it's a couple on a date or something, but a guy and a girl.  But like three or four people at a table, they were just staring at me and the set was going okay.  It wasn't my greatest set.  It was okay.  And they weren't, again, heckling or talking, but it was fucking, I could, you feel like I knew that that table wouldn't like me. 
[00:38:00]  I even said it when I went upstairs.  Oh, really?  I just, you know.  And you know, and it's like, but the stuff that black people always like that I talk about is sex.  I don't know why, but anything else, no, they just don't.  They don't want to laugh.  Yeah, maybe they just don't think it's funny.  They like the McGickin jokes.  They don't like the Gibbs-Mittat jokes.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Let me say hi to Richard on Long Island.  Richard.  Ooh, treehouse.  Hey. 
[00:38:30]  What's up, buddy?  That's right.  Good morning.  Get that mouth ready.  How are you?  You get a big surprise to fucking...  What's up there, Richard?  Good morning.  I'm from Montauk.  Hi.  Good morning.  Oh, you know what happened to Mickey J?  Yeah.  What a great guy.  Everybody loved him in the town.  He would pick up side work in the morning and...  Sounds like him.  11 a.m. would be the first bar that would open and he'd get 50-cent drafts.  And so he worked for his beer. 
[00:39:00]  So my dad owned a drugstore and back in the day when we used to put the sections of the newspaper together.  So he'd come in on Saturday and put the New York Times sections together for the Sunday sections.  So one morning, you know, my father would take me down to the drugstore.  I was younger.  And we'd put the sections together.  And every time we'd walk in, he'd be sleeping in the back of the drugstore.  That's a hell of a tribute.  Exactly. 
[00:39:30]  Where's the harmonica music?  That's kind of interesting, though.  Go ahead.  Drinking, putting newspapers together.  Totally naked.  Huh?  He'd be on top of the newspapers totally naked.  Who got those?  Yeah, who got that paper?  Someone's thumbing through Newsday, licking their finger to try to, like, turn the page.  They wonder why there's shit in the middle of their newspaper.  He was beloved in Montauk, I tell you, man.  Everybody gave him a job.  How did he die?  We get that, but how did he...  Yeah, how did he...  He's asleep on the beach.  And he slept one night too close to the water. 
[00:40:00]  And the tide came in.  And he drowned.  Yeah, I did hear that.  Really?  So I guess that is true.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Yeah, he was a character, man.  Supposedly, everyone in Montauk knew this guy.  No, he was the mayor of Montauk, yeah.  He was the mayor of Montauk.  Everybody loved him, man.  How long ago did he die?  How old was he?  No, no, no.  How long ago?  Oh, a long time.  A long time.  Probably about maybe 20 years ago.  Wow.  15 years ago.  15, maybe.  All right. 
[00:40:30]  Slept by the beach.  You know how drunk you gotta be to sleep through fucking water washing over you, licking at you  and washing over you?  Yeah, the tide doesn't just come in like in a second.  Yeah, it's like he died in a tsunami.  Jesus.  High tide got him?  Yeah, high tide.  That's the hell way to go.  Killed by sand erosion.  There's so much shit that'll get you in this world, but I never think that high tide's  going to be the thing that gets me.  That's got to be slow.  Right.  Every day the police officers would take his bike away from him because they didn't want 
[00:41:00]  him drinking and driving.  What bike?  A motorcycle or an actual bicycle?  No, bicycle.  Jesus.  How old was he when he died?  He's young.  19?  In his 40s.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Why would they vote for a guy like that to elect a guy like that into office though?  It is odd that he was elected to public office.  Yeah, really strange.  That was his honorary.  Oh!  Thank you. 
[00:41:30]  You guys would have loved to have him for the homeless stuff.  He would have been great.  Did he have a place to live?  Never.  Never.  Not even when he was a kid?  In the winter, he would sleep in people's sheds and stuff.  A lot of people took him in.  Mom, I was going to say, it sounds like you guys didn't really like him.  Yeah.  Making him sleep in a shed.  In a shed.  It's the mayor of Montauk and he's sleeping in your goddamn shed next to an oil can.  Was he supposed to sign all those bills?  Yeah.  When a bill becomes a book.  He got sick.  Of course. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  All right, Richard.  Well, thank you for that uplifting tribute.  Exactly.  All right, man.  Make it on the newspapers.  I never forgot the guy.  He was a character.  That's for sure.  At the end of a slavery documentary, that was.  Depressing.  So there you go.  No new arena for the Islanders for now.  For now.  But like I said, I would bet money that that will be done with some type of private funding.  Because if it's that good for Nassau County, they'll figure it out.  They'll figure it out. 
[00:42:30]  Just not on my fucking dime.  $100 million deficit.  And when they say it's only $13, it's only $13 a year.  So I have so many hundreds upon hundreds of $13 that I've taken out.  And the $13 is for 30 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  30 years.  30 years.  Stop it already.  Just another $13.  And then.  Everyone that was fighting.  And then what happens after 30 years?  Do you stop paying that $13?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think at that point, it's just part of what you continue paying.  That's what happens, right? 
[00:43:00]  I would assume.  And all the other $13 they'll pile on in the 30 years.  To all the $13 I'm paying already.  I would love to know the other promises that were made back in the day that ran out.  But you continue to pay because they rolled it over into something else.  Into just a real thing that's going to last forever.  And yeah, fuck you.  I'm not giving them that much money to work with.  They haven't proven themselves as competent to have $400 million and do the right thing with it.  Dude, they can't get the 9-11 responders their money for cancer treatment. 
[00:43:30]  This fucking asshole government.  We live under this system.  Why would you trust them to build an arena?  They can't do it.  It's disgusting.  It looks like the trade center's not going to be...  It looks like the cement workers are going to stop working.  Really?  Because the union fucking bullshit.  And yeah, 10-year anniversary.  They're going to probably be on strike and not another fucking floor is going to be poured.  And then they've got to see what other workers aren't going to cross that picket line if that does happen.  So it's just like 10 years later and really? 
[00:44:00]  There'd be a fucking mutiny if the concrete workers 10 years ago said,  Yeah, yeah, we're striking.  They're like, what?  You unpatriotic fuck.  And now it's just business as usual.  No one can get anything done.  No one.  I don't want fucking the government spending money on these big union deals where there's kickbacks and all kinds of other bullshit.  Fuck you.  I'd rather have a guy like Steve Jobs in charge of the thing with his goddamn fucking graham cracker liver. 
[00:44:30]  What you're saying is that socialism is because everybody fights for the team as opposed to capitalism.  Everybody fights for themselves.  So in a weird way, you're actually saying that capitalism is ugly.  And there's a truth to that.  There's a selfishness in the country where we all give a fuck about ourselves and nobody's fighting for the common good.  And I don't, you know, it's bizarre.  But that's just it.  I like the capitalism.  I don't like the socialism.  I don't like the government getting money and then deciding what the fuck to do with it and who's going to get it and shit like that. 
[00:45:00]  That I don't like at all.  They've been proven to be not trustworthy.  And I want private enterprise to go in and build a sports complex.  Let them do it.  Let them make some money.  Let them pay the workers.  Because you know what?  There's going to be...  Do you think I want the government fuckers as the overseers of $400 million and getting these union contracts?  You don't think they're all in fucking bed with these motherfuckers?  No way. 
[00:45:30]  I didn't care if it was one penny I wasn't voting fucking yes.  Not one cent.  This guy goes to your point.  Josh in Arizona.  Josh?  Yes.  Hi, sir.  In Phoenix, Arizona, the Cardinal Stadium.  I don't remember how much it was.  But it was not just the stadium.  It was a stadium, a mall, and some hotels.  They put it to a vote for the citizens as well.  We voted no. 
[00:46:00]  And they decided to build it anyways.  They added a tax to us.  And they just completely ignored it.  That was at least 10 years ago.  Yeah, that's what they're saying, too.  That there's some kind of wrangling they can do where they'll shuffle shit around and taxpayers will wind up paying for it anyway.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah.  So you vote.  You vote because you don't want your taxes to be raised at all.  And then they just figure a workaround.  Unbelievable.  So we'll see if that happens.  But I got my eye on these motherfuckers.  Look, I love my eye on these.  I love hockey, but, man, the tax thing and the government and politicians is fucking way more important to me than hockey. 
[00:46:30]  The bullshit they're getting away with is just sickening.  Yeah.  Sickening.  And someone's got it.  Like I said, I think if they have shown themselves as responsible and there was a balanced budget in Nassau County, there wasn't a deficit after all the highest taxes in the country.  You can't find a county that has higher taxes than Nassau County in New York, not even Beverly Hills.  Higher taxes. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  The highest taxes in the United States of America.  And they can't fucking have a surplus.  According to the paper, a hundred million dollar deficit.  They can't have a surplus.  That doesn't match.  So give them 400 million more.  Blow me.  You're right.  They're in common.  That was my vote.  It wasn't my vote against the Islanders.  It wasn't my vote against an arena.  It was my vote against giving these fucks more money when they can't even handle the unbelievable influx of money that's coming into the county. 
[00:47:30]  Sorry.  You know what everybody will vote?  When we have those little things in our fingers, we're all on the same grid and you can vote and it can't be tampered with.  And then you don't have to go anywhere when you can vote from home without it happening.  They don't want that.  I like that.  It's a little.  I don't want that.  It's not even that difficult.  But I like that it's a little difficult where you have to leave your house to vote.  Because then it's just too easy for people to fucking not even be informed and fucking vote. 
[00:48:00]  I like the idea that you have to do something to vote.  Okay.  You have to go out to a polling place.  There's a reason they make it a little harder to vote.  Yeah.  They don't trust the masses.  Well, guess what?  We don't trust you.  Yeah, we don't trust you.  So what the fuck?  We're in a stance.  You can't vote on anything now.  I don't give a shit.  All right.  We're going to break.  A lot of phone calls.  We'll go to the phones next, I guess.  Yeah.  And lots of things to do today.  Yeah.  We got an update on the Kings of Leon guys.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I heard about that.  Yeah, we beat them up nicely yesterday, and we got an update, so stay there. 
[00:48:30]  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and on to Broadway.  Listen, I gotta say something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  You make a toast to the crack that never heals, the more you rub it, the better it feels. 
[00:49:00]  You can scrub it from here to hell, you never get rid of that fishy smell.  I'm fucking for a bitch.  I know you're fucking.  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent  toilet humor.  First time I had sex, I was so scared, I was all by myself.  I says, how's with this guy?  I says, how's it going?  Is it in?  He says, yes.  Well, start walking towards me now.  Oh.  I asked this guy, I says, buddy, I says, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll the back that far, huh?  Wow.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes 
[00:49:30]  the Daily News.  Oh, wait.  What do you call?  What do you call a fat chick?  Chuck.  What the fuck?  How come only brothers could play basketball?  Because you got to know how to steal, run, and shoot.  Yeah, he's insulting.  Get the fuck out of here.  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post.  Yeah, I have to say one last thing.  I'll show up.  Yeah, it's probably should I show up.  I love black women.  I always take a shot in the dark.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it. 
[00:50:00]  I was with this girl.  I says, miss, did you ever have a 16-second orgasm?  He says, no.  He says, you got to fuck a minute?  What the fuck?  You mean?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Hey, God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, what the fuck?  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we 
[00:50:30]  couldn't get.  Reality Show and porno tape vixen, Kim Kardashian.  Primetime Sam Roberts with Kim Kardashian.  Kim, how often do you have to get groceries?  Once a week.  Thank you so much for your time.  Oh, you are so welcome.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the 
[00:51:00]  Opie and Anthony Show.  So you're starting a family and you've got a million questions, as any new parent would.  Thanks to the Nicey Nice Network, you'll get the answers you need.  All right, let's not play the modern day father, okay?  Andrew Dice Clay will set you straight on how to allocate all of those pesky parenting responsibilities.  You stay right there.  When the kid is born, let her do, meaning your wife, what she's supposed to do.  You know what I mean?  You can stand there and watch and applaud and go, you're doing a very good job. 
[00:51:30]  They do the diapering.  They're like numb to that shit.  Occasionally, there will be those pesky late night inconveniences.  A mother knows how to shut them up.  A father does not.  But that's not your problem.  When the baby cries in the middle of the night, I make it simple.  You turn on your side, two feet against her.  You start edging her towards the bed.  She'll know it's not the edge anymore when she goes over.  And she gets up and she goes, what the fuck?  And you say one word.  Don't make it a conversation.  Diaper. 
[00:52:00]  And that's it.  Eventually, your partner will need a break.  But be sure to keep her on a short leash.  Babies could sense when the father is watching them.  Because if you don't, well, just listen to Dice.  Because when she goes, I just want to go to the gym and work out.  And then you'll get the call, you know what?  I ran into Sarah.  She wants to get a little lunch.  Is that a...  And what are you going to do?  You go, all right, honey, go ahead.  Next thing you know, Sarah wants to have dinner with her.  We're having a glass of wine at some fucking shit bar.  Next thing you know, it's one in the morning. 
[00:52:30]  And you're ripping the hair out of your fucking head.  Here comes this fucking sloppy, drunk fucking animal.  And she's going, what's the matter?  I take care of the baby every day.  You can't watch the baby for a few hours.  And you said, you said you're going to the fucking gym.  That's what you fucking told me.  You understand that?  And you leave me here.  You know I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Baby's crying since you walked out of the fucking door.  Next thing you know, you're paying a hit for what you got.  Preenup or not.  They get fucking paid the minute babies start flying out of there. 
[00:53:00]  Parenting tips with Andrew Dice Clay.  I know what I'm good at.  I know what I'm not good at.  Now available from the Nicey Nice Network.  Your job is to go, and you leave.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith, Silent Bob,  and all those terrible Jay and Silent Bob type movies.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony here on XM.  Two dudes I could sit around and talk to for hours.  And have sat around and talked to for hours. 
[00:53:30]  Some MGMT.  I could handle that.  What's going on with MGMT?  Are they working on a new album?  I wasn't digging that last album they put out.  It was all right.  It grew on me, but no clue.  I don't know any of their stuff, actually.  Yeah, you do.  Do I?  What's one of them?  Oh, fuck yeah, you do.  Play them kids.  Huh?  By the way, Kevin Smith in there as well. 
[00:54:00]  He's 41 years old today.  Oh, yes.  You got kids by MGMT for a little Jimmy Norton?  We all know this.  Is it familiar yet, Jimmy?  He might not. 
[00:54:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I mean...  Why would he know this?  It's possible.  Just walking through life, you hear this shit.  It was a big song about three years ago.  A lot of times when music is playing, I'll just go like...  I love this fucking song.  Still not sick of it.  I like MGMT.  I'll wait for the...  Something to kick in.  I don't know this one. 
[00:55:00]  Uh-oh.  No clue, Jimmy.  I've never heard this.  You've heard this yet?  I'm so proud.  Dan's heard it.  Is it new?  No.  It's a couple years old now.  Yeah, it's like three years old now.  Rub my back, Travis.  I'm sore.  Sure.  While the music's on?  Okay, terrific.  No, I don't know this at all, man.  The MTV, by the way, the MTV, 30 years old.  So VH1, I guess, all week, is doing a VH1 classic. 
[00:55:30]  Nice.  Is doing a whole retrospective.  And I was watching last night.  Pretty fucking cool just seeing shit from mega years ago.  And they're playing all the old ads and promos and shit.  The I Want My MTV, like, it's so fucking cool to see, like, wow, that shit was old.  Like, it puts you right there.  Like, you remember, holy shit, I remember watching that.  I wonder what, MTV made Leary a star because Cindy Crawford.  They're showing all that stuff. 
[00:56:00]  I want CTV.  I want all Cindy TV.  I still remember those.  They're showing all Leary's shit.  They're showing House of...  He was years later, though.  He was late 80s, I think.  Well, he was...  I mean...  Yeah, yeah, but they're going through, like, everything.  And then they'll go back and show, like, shit from, you know, 1982.  What about, uh, what was his name?  Uh, Jesse Camp, was it?  I Want My MTV.  I haven't seen any Jesse Camp.  Was it Jesse Camp?  In the 90s, yeah.  Yeah, fucking Jesse Camp was supposed to be a huge star for them.  He was a bust. 
[00:56:30]  And the A Street Kids.  He was a bust.  They had the I Want My MTV with Pat Benatar and...  Very cool.  I Want My MTV.  Wow, look at this one.  Boy George.  I follow Boy George on Twitter.  He's a lonely man now, man.  Oh, is he?  He's just...  Ugh.  He's still just clubbing.  Jesse Camp.  I don't think they should show him for anything with MTV.  That should just be something they forgot.  Yeah, that was...  Shit, dog.  Here, here.  Look it up.  See your phone?  But, uh...  No, that's... 
[00:57:00]  I think it's cool.  Yeah, I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, we're from the East Coast.  It's old MTV?  It just came out here.  Oh, yeah.  That's just...  Not old enough.  But look at the camera stuff.  The MTV revolutionized TV camera work because they're the ones who were doing all those  weird, crazy, like, zooms and all that shit.  Yeah.  That was all MTV.  Shaky Cam.  I like the earlier shit, though, that they've been showing.  Way back.  That's, like, really bad.  Do you remember sitting around?  I would sit around with my brothers.  MTV was just so fucking huge for us and a lot of people our age.  Yeah.  And you would just sit all day until it got back to the first video again? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  You'd just sit for hours.  I don't remember what the original rotation was, but it was no more than 20 videos.  You'd sit for hours watching that show.  And it would rotate back and you would hear Chilliwack, gone, gone, gone.  Remember that?  That was one of those original fucking videos.  Do they have a list of the original videos?  Because we always try to come up with it.  Sure.  I don't know.  I know they, they, yeah, they probably do.  Did we tell the story on this show where they had to go to Jersey to, or maybe Nina Blackwood  told it, they had to go to Jersey to watch the premiere, I read, because it wasn't on 
[00:58:00]  New York Cable yet?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, when they first came out, the original VJs went to Jersey to see it.  Call your cable operator and tell them you want your MTV.  You're right.  We all know this one.  Go to Chilliwack, gone, gone, gone.  That was the one I referenced.  Chilliwack.  They were so smart in MTV, man.  When you hear this, though, a lot of people are going to go, holy fuck, they played the shit  out of this dumb song.  They were showing Yo MTV raps.  Oh, wow.  Fab Five Freddy.  Fab Five Freddy, motherfucker.  Right.  And they used to like, and some of the shit, the production value was just awful. 
[00:58:30]  When's the last time you fucked a girl who was alive before MTV was?  I can't remember.  That was a long time ago.  Fuck.  81.  Oh, Christ.  Holy mackerel.  No Chilliwack.  I'm not seeing it anymore.  Well, really.  That's like an original MTV song.  They should have that shit.  But that's a good question.  What was the rotation?  What was the first MTV videos?  There's got to be a Wikipedia somewhere.  They have like a list of bands. 
[00:59:00]  Everyone knows the first one.  What was the first one?  The one that...  Oh, and they aired the original hour two nights ago.  Oh, really?  The original hour would have been cool as hell to watch.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  I'm sure you can find that online or something.  I might have to do that tonight.  Yeah, it was...  Oh, you found it?  This song.  Remember this song?  My Girl.  My Girl?  What's the name of it?  Okay.  Remember this?  Who does it?  I'm glad you.  This was an MTV original video.  Oh, that's a shovel.  Well, it sounds dated now, huh? 
[00:59:30]  Well, it's 30 years.  Oof.  That sounds 70s almost.  Was it 81?  Oh, 81.  I thought it was 83.  81.  Video killed the radio star.  Right.  Right.  Standing around with the gang on the corner.  Talking about my girl.  My girl.  Video killed the radio star. 
[01:00:00]  You better run by Pat Benatar.  Wait, I wanted to guess these, but all right.  Yeah, that's right.  You better you bet by The Who is one of the originals.  Oh, yeah.  Rod Stewart.  She won't dance with me.  I don't remember that one.  Oh, can you play a little bit of Rod?  Rod Stewart is fucking terrible.  You don't like Rod Stewart?  Dude, I like that you think I'm sexy, because I just remember when I was a kid, I had the  .45.  Yeah.  Wow, wow.  45, it should have been a gun.  I know.  Listening to a fucking obvious cum gargling. 
[01:00:30]  Did you think I'm sexy was all right?  Yeah, sugar, sugar.  That was one of those dumb, guilty pleasures.  I started hating him when he sang, we're having a party.  I like Tippy's version.  If you want my body, you think I'm sick?  I don't know if I like any Rod Stewart songs.  What else does he sing?  Downtown Train, when he slowed it down a little bit, right?  Did you put an apostrophe in Won't?  Brass and Pio.  Maggie Mae fucking blows.  I liked Maggie Mae. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Take it on the run.  R.E.O.  Hold on Loosely.  Wait, read them all, Ant.  I hated that song.  There's only 20 or so.  Yeah.  When Things Go Wrong, Robin Lane and the Chart Busters.  History Never Repeats, Split Ends.  Hold on Loosely, 38 Special.  Remember that one?  Oh, right.  Yeah, sure.  Yes.  Just Between You.  Just Between You and Me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  April Wine, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sailing by Rod Stewart.  And Iron Maiden. 
[01:01:30]  Sure, it's like Cruising.  Iron Maiden.  Yeah.  Keep on Loving You by R.E.O.  Oh, sure.  That's a good song.  Bluer Than Blue by Michael Johnson.  I remember Bluer Than Blue.  Message of Love.  The Pretenders.  Yeah.  Bluer Than Blue said it did said.  And Mr. Briefcase by Lee Ritt.  You know what happened back then, Ant?  What?  If you just happened to have a video, you lucked out.  Yeah.  If you had a video, you went, yeah.  Half these bands are shit, but they need a video.  So they're like, fuck, send your videos in.  We'll play them immediately. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, you're on the motherfucker.  A lot of these bands you've never heard of since.  The Pretenders.  I think that's what Rod Stewart did.  Rod Stewart made a lot of videos specifically to play on MTV, and that's why he had like  five or six on the first day.  Some bands had done live film of their shit for Don Kirshner's rock concert in the 70s,  and they just took that shit and ran it on MTV.  Right.  So that's why you get some of these bands from the 70s.  Let me ask you, what... 
[01:02:30]  Do you like Stevie Nicks?  No, I always hated Stevie Nicks.  Stinks.  She stinks.  I can't say she stinks.  I fucking hate her.  Stinks.  It's okay not to like her, but you can't say she stinks.  Stupid.  Voice.  Edge of 17.  Get back.  When was this song?  On the edge of 17.  On the edge of 17.  On the edge of 17.  Shut up.  She stinks, Jimmy.  She stinks.  She stinks.  She's had an amazing career.  You've got to acknowledge that at least.  I do.  She's gotten very lucky.  It just might not be your taste.  She was on American's Got Talent last night. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, that's why I ask.  She did Edge of 17.  She still sounds good.  She really does.  Still, when did she ever?  I like Stevie Nicks.  I like Fleetwood Mac.  Stop dragging my heart around.  That's what she did with Tom Petty.  I fucking hate Fleetwood Mac.  You don't like Rumors?  You don't like Fleetwood Mac?  You don't like Landslide?  No.  You might be fucking a communist.  I never like Fleetwood Mac.  Nah, I'm not a big fan.  Rumors?  Nothing off Rumors?  I'm sure I like one off Rumors.  What's off Rumors? 
[01:03:30]  Don't Stop Believin'?  I bet...  I mean, uh...  Definitely not Don't Stop Believin'.  I bet Jimmy would like Tusk.  Yeah, Jimmy would be a big Tusk fan.  I meant to say Don't Stop.  How's that go?  Don't Stop?  Hold on.  There's enough Fleetwood Mac.  Holy shit.  I saw Stevie Nicks in concert.  Of course you did.  This song is fucking horrendous.  You don't like this?  No.  Turn this up.  I not only dislike it, I find it deplorable.  Listen to the words. 
[01:04:00]  Brings you back to a time, man.  I Want to Be a Lifeguard by Blotto.  I remember that.  We stole their cocaine at Augie's Checkered Flag Lounge in Kingston.  I got a Blotto story.  One of the chicks in my dorm...  See, I went to Geneseo, and we couldn't get cool bands to come to our fucking college.  So you got Blotto.  So we got Blotto, and it was the big get.  Oh, of course.  And this pig in my dorm basically blew the entire band.  And we all knew her as the girl that blew Blotto.  That was the Blue Blotto girl. 
[01:04:30]  For four years, that's what she was known for.  Hey, fucking...  Yeah, what about Tusk?  Thank you, Riverrack.  Tusk.  Juice Newton.  Yeah, I was just saying.  Jimmy would love Tusk.  Do you like Tusk?  I don't know Tusk, but speaking of Tusks, can you get some Fleetwood Mac?  E-Rock, you have to work today.  What are you doing?  Let's go.  You're jumping to 5-6 bands.  That's fine.  That's why you got me quick in there.  Let's go, man.  I said Fleetwood Mac at 7-0-3.  You have to make an executive decision.  Exactly.  Put on Fleetwood Mac before I go in there and kiss you.  This is Don't Stop.  Oh, yeah.  It's okay. 
[01:05:00]  Exactly.  Yeah, the 70s, 70s, 70s, 70s.  Was this Clinton's song?  Yeah, it sure was.  Yeah.  What about Go Your Own Way?  Yeah, Go Your Own...  Yeah, there's a lot of good...  Yeah, you know what?  That's okay, too.  I'm telling you.  Go Your Own Way is good.  Go Tusk.  It's a little deeper.  Yeah, I'll say that.  Gold Dust Woman?  Gold Dust Woman is a good song.  What is that?  What does it mean, even?  She's a woman of Gold Dust?  Yes.  Fuck her.  She's magical.  She's magical. 
[01:05:30]  I thought it was wrestling.  Yeah.  I like Gold Dust.  Yeah, of course you do.  Which song is this?  This is Toss.  This is a little deeper.  They got crazy and got an actual marching band.  That's right.  To back them up on this one.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  Oh, I like this dumb...  Rhiannon.  I meant when this was a real world premiere video.  That's good.  Rhiannon.  No, not Rhiannon.  That's shit.  Hey, one of the big songs, though, number 41, Angel of the Morning by Juice Newton.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Juice Newton.  He called me Angel.  It's a good song.  That's a good song.  Isn't it?  Yes.  If I said get out, Angel, that's what he said.  I like dreaming, because dreaming can make you cry.  I like dreaming.  What a fruit.  How long is this intro, for fuck's sake?  Oh, forever.  It's endless.  It's a little deep.  Cliff Richards.  What was the big hit by him?  Not that one.  Cliff Richards was...  Yeah.  Do you know?  No.  Why would I know? 
[01:06:30]  Pretenders were huge.  Oh, I know.  Talking Heads was huge.  Cliff what?  What's his name?  Cliff what?  Cliff Richards.  Lacey Fabergé.  Hey, this is big song.  I don't think it was.  It's mid-thin.  Of course you did.  Talking Heads was huge.  This is cool.  Cow to the county.  I like this.  Elvis Costello was pretty heavy rotation.  Fuck Elvis Costello.  I never got Elvis Costello.  Really?  You don't like him?  I never got it, man. 
[01:07:00]  And The Beacon.  You know, I live close to The Beacon.  Fucking sold out shows like a week straight for Elvis Costello.  They love him.  His one song I like, but the rest of it's all just...  I mean, I like a couple of the basic songs.  Allison.  And what was the other one?  That other one he did.  Yeah, yeah.  That other one he did.  Pump it up.  Fuck pump it up.  Radio, radio, radio.  What's so funny about peace?  Love you.  I understand, dude.  I think he's the most overrated guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, very overrated because he has dumb glasses.  Lots of the detectives, yeah.  Radio, radio, radio. 
[01:07:30]  Good song.  I love you.  Never got this.  This reminds me of that fucking...  Not Devo.  What kind of music would you classify this as?  It just reminds me of that genre.  This is like kind of New Wave.  New Wave runs from this.  Oh, yeah.  He was poppy.  He was part of that whole movie.  Who's more overrated though?  Elvis Costello or Lou Reed?  Lou Reed.  I hate Lou Reed.  Fucking stinks.  Lou Reed sucks with his talking his way through a song.  Wow, you just lost all the hipsters.  The hipsters hate you now. 
[01:08:00]  Talking his way through a song.  Who cares?  They hate me anyway.  Sorry, I don't like the Velvet Underground.  Did the colored girls go do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do?  Lou Reed fucking blows.  Yeah.  He blows.  I hate the Lou Reed.  I like the colored girls going do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  This is actually a good song.  I love this song.  He's a fucking asshole.  I could do this.  The thing is, he's not even just talking to him.  He's trying to sing.  Yeah.  And he's so- he can't sing.  Well, he's a heroin addict.  He's got no fucking-  I don't know.  He can't stay on key for anything.

[01:25:00]  and mayor siler all different parts of the nation they all have to yeah we missed it that's all right  he's right over at fox we ought to stop by and uh say hi yeah hey remember us come on by no come  on by we'll have a little chat by squad sam found the wrong vice squad oh it happens season hubly  we got uh danny mcbride coming in in about 20 minutes yes we a lot of controversy about his new movie 
[01:25:30]  because it's a comedy but it's based on a very serious fucking story okay right yes it is wait  is he in the fucking pizza yes yeah oh i was just reading about that actual case that guy wells was  killed it's crazy right how does how does the story go jimmy there was a pizza maker um and he robbed a  bank with a bomb collar on and he said that he was uh delivering pizza and he was forced at gunpoint  to go to the bank and hand this note over he had a cane it was a gun disguised as a cane 
[01:26:00]  and he was told to uh go rob a bank and there was a collar that would blow up if he didn't do it and  get back in a certain amount of time yeah and then there was another place where we went through a  drive-through mcdonald's and uh there was then there was another one like he would get clues at each  place i believe and the final place they got him was that this outside this eyeglass place or something  he was supposed to rob and there's footage of the the clues the the clues were to get the keys to  get the collar off get the collar off he robbed the bank and then he had to go get the keys to get 
[01:26:30]  the collar off yeah and there was uh the cops just made him sit there oh boy outside the fucking uh  outside the uh eyeglass place or whatever there's this footage i go online you can see it  of him uh he's kneeling he's like could you get this off me could you get this off me  and they no one went near him because they didn't know if he had a bomb on him  they're waiting for the bomb squad he just blew up in front of everybody  here goes his head but now that a lot of times they're saying now that it's that he was involved  with it and just didn't realize it was a real bomb but he did have a bullet in his leg um and 
[01:27:00]  there he is right there i remember this yeah he just blows so denny mccrides exploding pizza man  and then afterwards geez they had to decapitate him by the way to get the thing off his neck they  couldn't even figure out how to how to get it off but they said that the woman there was a woman  involved she's now in jail she was bipolar a couple of the guys involved were dead the woman's  boyfriend she murdered another one of the guys died of lymphoma um so the people the main players  who probably were involved in this are dead but they said one of the guys was a sociopath and 
[01:27:30]  probably enjoyed this how weird so then danny mccrides in this movie called 30 minutes or less  and it's a comedy about this horrific fucking story it's not based on this story though it's kind  of goofy and silly some people saying it is based on well they're saying no the more people are saying  that they didn't know it's very similar but oh but the movie people are saying this is just  they probably didn't know aziz i think is in it too he's a pretty big role very funny guy yeah he's  a good actor very cool all right well the movie is exactly this yeah story oh really but they made 
[01:28:00]  it very silly and goofy like the bomb is like says bomb on it it's just his family's not happy  oh oh i bet oh why would they they don't like pizza movies either i understand sure they've never had  pizza since oh no you bet how much would that suck it wouldn't be so bad if somebody was picking  up lima beans and blew up exactly fucking all the delicious treats to not be able to have pizza is  wonderful brussels sprout factory or something yeah just some kind of has to be pizza some kind of  awful thing you don't know if it's a fruit or a vegetable well look at i love that i need one of these 
[01:28:30]  for home i'll fucking spray that thing until your fucking tits fall off lady jesus those air things i like  the spray girls under the clip that's where you clear clean off your keyboard with that yes i would  gather um use it cbs news in chicago is misleading and possibly racist what oh yeah oh yeah i wonder  what they they do a story about a shooting uh talking to a four-year-old on the street 
[01:29:00]  why is there a four-year-old on the street well why is there a four-year-old on the street travis you're  a parent i'm a parent i can't even imagine having my guy go hey have fun is there a parent around  is was there a parent close by or is there just a four-year-old on the street what's it in chicago  yeah probably just on the street probably just on the street that's racist meantime two teenagers  are wounded on the city's south side it happened at east 74th that is part of an 18 year old man  and 16 year old girl were hit while standing on the sidewalk males in good condition while the 
[01:29:30]  girls expected to recover and kids on the street as young as four were there to see it all unfold  and had a disturbing reaction no i'm not scared of nothing when you get older you gonna stay away  from all these guns no no no what do you want to do when you get older go have me a gun that is very  scary indeed so far no suspects are in custody that's a four-year-old they don't learn that  it's it's it's just inherent no no that's not true oh really literal jim yes of course why are they 
[01:30:00]  being called racist for just showing the girl talking yeah i don't who's a boy oh whatever  why is it racist well they played the interview out of context oh why why what's the context they  cut off the end of the interview what did he say what did he say psych  we have the clip oh okay ah we have the entire clip in context that's right oh  like that do we get home i didn't realize oh god yeah that guy that guy oh i mean ph yeah 
[01:30:30]  when you get older you gonna stay away from all these guns no no no what do you want to do when you  get older i'm gonna have me a girl you are why you want to do that i'm gonna be the police okay  well then then you can have one what the the fucking media really is that's great that is 
[01:31:00]  the complete opposite oh that's fantastic what pieces of creative editing wow you know what pieces  of pieces of shit because we all just assume right that black kids gonna grow up and be a  fucking gangster terrible the whoever edited that should be fucking fired maybe it was edited for  truth i mean really but that's really that's basically that's a blatant lie that's taking oh  it really he wants to be one of the good guys but it didn't go hand in hand with the story they 
[01:31:30]  needed with with what they fucking need i'm gonna have me a gun i want to keep playing the end of  that again it's so fucking deceptive that whole clip how'd you get the full clip they uh well  what's the n double a cp released the you know what the n double a cp is fucking is right about  this one my brothers here's what they aired on the news let's do this again the end here  no no no what do you want to do when you get older go have me a gun  that is very scary indeed so far no suspects are in custody and this cocksucker reporter knew because 
[01:32:00]  he's the one who asked the question yeah he knew and the guy back in the studio knew oh that's very  scary indeed and this is what take that part out and this is exactly what he said when you get older  you can stay away from all these guns no no no what do you want to do when you get older you are  why you want to do that i'm gonna be the police okay well then then you can have one see right right  there these fucking god what scumbags n double a cp is totally fucking right wow can't trust uh the 
[01:32:30]  media can't trust the government can't trust the politicians in general now we're done what is the  explanation of that news station for that yeah what do they say what's their official what garbage  statement do they release it makes me want to i i hope somebody was fucking shit can for it but what  what's the statement they apologized for mistakes made right yeah reporting and editing more general  fucking soulless apologies and they said that uh the people throughout the company have been spoken 
[01:33:00]  to ah what would they say to them they got caught because they do that with every story it's not  just this they just got caught the media does this all the time they just got fucking caught  that's fucking uh so irritating unbelievable that's great i'm glad that they're actually  picking up on this though they said uh we accept responsibility for the mistakes that were made  both in the reporting it's not a mistake it's an on purpose it's not a mistake how about you get to 
[01:33:30]  say why did you do it yeah they got caught for an on purpose yeah it wasn't a mistake a mistake would be  oh i i meant to edit out something uh something happened in the program and it cut out the other piece  that i'm i didn't mean to cut out and left that in and i no that's a mistake an on purpose is let's cut  out the part where he says he wants to be a cop so it really sounds bad right that it's just  perpetuating this whole crime uh with uh young black men and or just to get the point across 
[01:34:00]  they they should just say look we're really sorry that we took we're supposed to be news and we  enjoy all the benefits of uh complete freedom that news organizations have when it comes to the fcc but  we decided to do some selective news making instead of reporting it as it were that they should just tell  the truth yeah so they should all be fucking shot the video of the child should not have aired as  soon as news management identified the problem they took immediate steps to ensure that the video 
[01:34:30]  would not air in subsequent newscasts in addition sequent yeah subsequent oh my god you're from england  aren't you subsequent no let me see i think he's right actually sequence where are you where are you  where are you reading that from right there subsequent all right just read the sentence over you  you know he's actually right i'm sorry you dumb motherfucker oh what what sequent it's kind of  like your intelligence is subpar because sequential but sam lives in foreign lands though man at least 
[01:35:00]  you got an excuse where he came from i was raised in various accents yeah uh in addition we have  followed up with our employees to make sure that we all have learned from the mistakes that were  but it wasn't a mistake why don't they say we tried to make the story something it wasn't it's not  a mistake it's not a mistake they got caught period they should say well we got caught yes this is  what we do and that's just the editor and the reporter it's probably not the management they  probably all go into a room and say cut this might have been the editor and the reporter 
[01:35:30]  oh that's just understood why would the reporter go it's just understood to edit in such a way to pump  up fucking uh the story make it more you know sensational all right why don't we uh break  because i think danny mcbride will be here any moment yes he's promoting 30 minutes or less and we  got uh we got some eastbound and downs to give away we sure do yes danny where's that dumb plug i  gotta i didn't print it out for you oh you didn't why because i forgot well what are you doing 
[01:36:00]  i'm gonna go print it out but what do we need to tell a mistake do you want to apologize yeah you  apologize for mistakes made yeah i've spoken to the to the people to make sure that there's  no more mistakes made all right all right we'll give it away uh when he's in and the cool thing  is i think he's gonna sign him for us he already did oh he did all right good he better good so  you're getting tough after the fact you get a signed copy of eastbound and down season two we're not  giving away now because we have to read some dumb slug line that's cool so we'll do it in a  a little bit make him wait yes sirius xm this is the virus 
[01:36:30]  oh the pope was overheard motherfucking at&t service  he said this iphone's a piece of shit and threw it off the balcony  who did he do 
[01:37:00]  he's bound and down danny mcbride in studio what's up sir not too much how you doing i like that you  continue to do our show yes i really like that i like that yeah he's one of the few famous people  that comes back loyal yeah kind of famous the famous boomerang yes yeah you're very good man 
[01:37:30]  you have a great career going we lose you guys eventually eventually but he's hanging in there  that's why we lose people because we immediately sabotage you with gee us why would you be here with  us yeah and then they start to think about it and go like hey you know you're right why am i with you  losers why do they put his face let me know there's a controversy around your new film  it's called 30 minutes or less um you know the controversy is because of the the pizza the real 
[01:38:00]  life pizza disaster um did you know that when you were doing this or did the writers just not know  it or no i don't care what about domino's pizzas being delivered in 30 minutes or less you get it  for free that controversy yes that's very and a lot of people are saying that sometimes you won't  get your pizza due to the actual deliverer having a bomb belt on his throat yeah uh i don't know i  mean i can't speak on behalf of the writers but uh when i got the script i didn't i didn't i guess i  had just kind of forgotten about that thing that happened yeah i didn't put it together either until 
[01:38:30]  just right today because it's so it's different because i don't know it just seemed weird that it's  a chest bomb and not a neck bomb that that actually made a big difference because it was  uh the thought of having one around your neck seems really sick yeah the chest is kind of  acceptable yeah i don't know why yeah yeah you're playing this i'm sorry uh i was just gonna say  you walked us through the original story just before uh break and it was horrific yeah the video is  really awful this is a comedy notes this will be better of course and you should be able to make fun 
[01:39:00]  of this will be better it's two different things better no but i mean it was a real news story and  and this is a comedy but it's it's gonna laugh at because danny mcbride's in it who are you playing  in it danny uh i play the guy who masterminds this really terrible plan and kidnap jesse eisenberg me  and nick swartzen do oh nick's okay nick makes the bomb that goes on jesse and we force him to rob a  bank so that i can get money to pay a hitman to kill my dad so it's a very simple easy plan yeah yeah 
[01:39:30]  nick is a funny guy man love nick he makes adam sandler movies tolerable yeah oh wow  danny's not saying no how about you're out of it don't worry about it you don't have to say  anything danny i know i know he's gold in hollywood but i personally have never gotten the adam sandler  thing how about aziz uh aziz is jesse's best friend in the film okay and uh you know nick and i are the  bad guys jesse and aziz are the good guys so most of my stuff was with uh was with nick and i'd never 
[01:40:00]  met nick before this film but uh we got along similarly he's a funny funny really funny cracked  me up yeah we've had him on a couple times we love nick yeah no i'm happy to see him just another  one of my friends taking off in the movies uh him and his ease it's always good to see  you fucking languish from six to ten every morning your friends just taking off in the motion picture  industry nothing makes me happier and you get to be woken up at 5 30 by kenny every morning yeah no i love  it i love to just our kenny by the way yeah not kenny powers yeah close to kenny has to wake up jimmy 
[01:40:30]  and he's a bore yeah you know jesse was good in uh uh zombie land is the same director it's the same  director yeah yeah because that was i like the way zombie land looked that this movie has the same sort  of like the the it's really it has a nice tight like pace to it yeah it's handled really well yeah  that's that was one of the main reasons i jumped on when i read the script the script's hilarious and  just seeing what reuben did with zombie land it's like you knew that he could kind of handle the 
[01:41:00]  comedy and the action and kind of combine them into something yeah and put some morbid shit in  there and still keep it funny yeah for sure uh yeah that kid's hilarious uh and fucking zombie  lamb was running around how much talk was rules cardio it's just hilarious so i'm just i'm just stating  funny shit from another from another movie well we haven't seen this yet usually we get to see the  movies before you guys come in but for this one we weren't able to go to the screen  how much real talk was there about you taking over for corral what was your name did you get 
[01:41:30]  thrown in there by a publicist or were you actually really no i don't you know i i would read about it  just as like anyone else would i would just see it in entertainment weekly like oh they're considering  me for the office wow right how great is that you don't want to come out and just go no they're not  that would be self-destructive that's the kind of thing i would do and i'd go no no they're not at  all and then immediately take myself out of the story like an asshole boy nick's mustache is funny 30  minutes or less this is how dumb i am i was at comic-con uh recently and i we saw that 30  minutes or less thing and i had no idea we were far across the street from the poster i had no idea 
[01:42:00]  that i know three out of the four guys that are in it that's wrong with you yeah maybe that's my  problem i don't network properly no fucking nick's mustache is horrendous i really like it that's  a good one oh what a terrible 70s mustache they gave fucking sports and like i like sporting one  yeah it's pretty tight it's a good one yeah why does he look frightened he uh he's standing next  to the bomb i think he is frightened yeah from the trailer he looks frightened most of the movie  because of the the bomb how uh how is jesse eisenberg because he was so he was so good as a 
[01:42:30]  fucking a complete social misfit in uh anti-social network or social network jesus i swear that's your  tour yeah i know and i didn't do that funny i just made a mistake believe me that name is done anyway  that fucking dopey dated name my agent came up with uh really ties in a tour name to a movie  why don't we just call it apocalypse later we were just touring a bunch of comedians  my agent's like call the anti-social network so we went with it but then we're like the 
[01:43:00]  fucking movie's over no one cares anymore you dope but uh how much different is jesse in this than  than that well he's not uh he's not creating any social networks in this movie he's obviously not a  billionaire he's like uh he's like a pot smoking pizza guy so he doesn't have any ambition so he's  the exact opposite of uh of his character in the facebook movie do you when you this is a corny actor  question but when you go in and do something do you say like all right i'm figuring out who this guy  is or you pretty much just go in there and just start being yourself and you know how do you analyze 
[01:43:30]  a role when you do it yeah i don't take it that seriously you don't right i just show up with the lines  memorized all right he just finished his line i know i know i was my turn to talk it's my turn  my turn my turn my turn your turn your turn my turn my turn your turn it's gotta be the worst  thing an actor can think is my turn to talk now it's your turn you go now yeah i'm so bad that i  actually i'll rehearse pauses and facial gestures like alone in a mirror like what do you mean 
[01:44:00]  meanwhile the scene wide eyes yeah and then he doesn't talk in the pace or cadence you think  he's going to mr fabasham fuck see you're always off book when you go in that that's  actors talking it means you haven't memorized yeah yeah it means you have memorized you've been  off book jimmy impressive ah you know i know they want me to go in today for a fucking audition for  a nickelodeon voiceover nice nice you do voices yeah i do a fucking but not for that network i don't  don't hire me for nickelodeon why not i'm too tired i'm going home going to bed you're not 
[01:44:30]  even going to go to the audition no i'm getting a massage i'm gonna fucking do something on my  stomach that humiliates her and makes me feel good and i'm gonna nap i'm not going on the audition  nick swartzen would go to the audition nick wouldn't have to nick's offer only at this point i'm pretty  sure really wow yeah nick doesn't want to maybe he does you don't audition right would you read for  something if like it's a project like say that somebody you really love is doing like and they have  everybody reading for it when's the last time you read for something i'm talking a lot you know i 
[01:45:00]  never we're i've never even had to audition for a movie before holy wow really god is that nice we  just made the foot fist way and then just started getting work off of that right that's great though  have you seen foot fist way yet i know we talk about every time danny's in it it's a great movie  i've heard it's great will ferrell is right yeah will ferrell discovered you through that right  yep uh we were in a sex chat room and you both realize the other one's not 13 and you had a laugh 
[01:45:30]  and then and then it then he goes and does do uh due date tropic thunder pineapple express  observe and report which we've told you we me and jimmy love that fucking movie way way more than  oh my god yeah oh my god that's my favorite comedy of the last i don't know how many years i  fucking howled in the movie theater at that fucking movie with ray liotta i hate your  fucking guts he's scary isn't he he's awesome in it yeah not many people have intimidated me over 
[01:46:00]  the years ray liotta when he came in he actually looked at me at one point go what's wrong with  him is he sick i was just mesmerized by the guy he's fucking intimidating he really is you know  jody hill directed absurd port he's the guy he directed foot fist way and he's one of the creators  on eastbound so yeah he's a pretty sick sense of humor that's such a great that comedy and again  not the mock-up's bad it's just not my sensibility but it's like it hits a broader audience but that  observing report is everything the fucking comedy should be it was ballsy yeah fucking banging her 
[01:46:30]  while she's got puke on it's like that it's hilarious that was great hilarious it was so funny  that movie man i love anna ferris the skateboard in the face is great dude that when seth takes a  how fucking hard did he smash that kid's face yeah with a skateboard it's everything you want  to do with a skateboard you want to just cave someone's head in with it absolutely wow i love  that that guy who runs nude the flasher at the very end of the movie is like one of our friends  we went to film school with and we're like we really need somebody who will go full nude for this movie 
[01:47:00]  and uh and has a comedy dick and randy happened to have all of that and he said it was the greatest  moment of his life yeah has he done anything since no he hasn't that's even better right  that's so great no comedy dick would be a fucking small horrible dick really kenji young is an awful  yeah oh his dick is the worst ever did you know he was a real doctor yeah i didn't  no i just wanted to stop the conversation with a boring tidbit about myself  mission accomplished 
[01:47:30]  uh where are we at with eastbound we're uh we're actually shooting right now nice i go back today uh  will ferrell comes into into town tonight and so we film with him all this week and uh nice yeah  we're having a blast we're about halfway through shooting the third season are you're shooting in  new york and uh north carolina oh so you're going back flying back okay i got you that's got to be  great though being able to just work with your friends and shit you know it's the best and to be  able to do it down there too where you're just there's no direct flights from los angeles to wilmington 
[01:48:00]  north carolina so that one layer was enough to make all the executives  a buffer right keep them away are they gonna get on a fucking prop yeah exactly aren't they the  worst damn that's nice they just ruin everything over thinking shit here they ruin shit in movies  over thinking everything and yeah trying to rationalize their own job and do you fly private  yet no i'm not i i have but it's always been because i've piggybacked on someone who gets to fly  private yeah i never have how is it uh it's cool every time i get on one of those planes i just 
[01:48:30]  think of la bamba i'm just thinking yeah all right yeah you'd hit the ground a lot faster  though yeah you think so yeah you're waiting at pain stewart yeah you wouldn't even know  those guys knew man they're in the air realizing off yeah it's true pain stewart people probably  didn't know they probably just lost cabin pressure that's the creepiest flight story ever it really  is pain stewart catastrophic pressure loss where they were just frozen they were dead and the plane just  kept flying and flying the thing is the uh the they they got a couple f-16s up there to check it out 
[01:49:00]  and when they were looking they they saw them through the frosted windows just frozen  like ghost plane or something that's a fucked up thing hey why don't you make a comedy about that  how long did the plane continue to fly do you remember still going  they don't know how to get it down it went pretty far uh i think it would have had it turned like  north or yeah sure or northwest it was up there a while and that was 99 oh where did these years go 
[01:49:30]  by the way i have no idea uh when does eastbound and down come out i think it's going to come out  either january or february of next year oh that's not too bad yeah you don't have to wait too long  good how many episodes this is eight episodes this year is that usually eight or seven episodes we've  we've we've increased it by one episode each year oh six seven eight oh that's great oh that's smart  yeah that first season sneak them in there get a nice long one more that first season when it was  only six we're like oh my god we need more of this yeah this you were killing us this next season is 
[01:50:00]  pretty insane i mean it's been a it's a been a it's been wild we've been able to get away with  everything we wanted to and wow that's nice give us a few examples or a little some something here  well a couple of teases people people die this season that's a new thing for eastbound yeah death yeah uh  that's fun and uh you know we always kind of saw this as something that would be three seasons long  so we're uh yeah we're trying to execute that and make it and finish this thing with a bang  there's something to be said for that the simplicity of only a few because the great the office the 
[01:50:30]  british office six six special fucking uh extra six six special that's six seven eight special would  be great you guys should close it out with a special is it so there's no idea what they're talking  about just kind of giving suggestions to the star of a successful show by the way was the title of  that fucking but boring dissertation is it is it tough to do that knowing you got something so great  eastbound and down is such a just a great show is it tough to cut it off short like that you know like  our we never really thought anyone would even watch this when we started so for us we kind of had always 
[01:51:00]  committed to this idea of a short order of them uh we do love doing the show and like we have a good  time with the characters so you know i'm not sure if once the show's over if it will if maybe we'll  try to like make the character live on outside of the show or maybe we'll just come back and do  another season a few years now but we're definitely kind of trying to end the story that we set out to  tell in the beginning you gotta have a lot of confidence i think in what you do to to be able to  stop doing something that's still working and successful yeah it's like oh i'll just do a next 
[01:51:30]  project and you're like oh really you don't consider that winning the fucking lottery you  dummy well well there's a lot of guys that tried that and you never heard from i know that's why  i gotta say you gotta have a lot of comments oh my god mcclain stevenson he was the hey hello larry  come on he did hello larry i'm ready to move on oh boy you know sad he must have been when they killed  him off he probably thought he'd come back for specials and then he read that he goes down the sea of  japan what the fuck i was kidding guys it was a contract ploy i was just trying to get a little 
[01:52:00]  heat around myself he wanted it he probably approached them with an episode where he walks  up on the beach with a life jacket hey i'm okay he's only cartoon burned you know some black on his  face hey guys you know like that's not gonna work for no stay away good for you guys and in the  series do you write how much of the writing do you do for eastbound all of it yeah oh you do  yeah jody and myself write the whole series and uh that's another reason why we keep it short is 
[01:52:30]  because it's just you know sure it's just a it takes about a year from the time you write to shoot  the whole thing to edit it so yeah when you write something you see like you okay so you have six or  seven or eight episodes you're doing do you see kind of where you want the beginning to go to the  end of the season or do you kind of constantly change that as you're going we we write it like  it's one large movie so we keep every episode open we just basically write like a 250 page script and  like break it into yeah oh shit so you know how it's gonna things are gonna end and go and then 
[01:53:00]  that's pretty smart fill in the blanks but other ways do you know when you go back and do that you  kind of have to go in and like balloon tie episodes at the end just to kind of make them for sure yeah  you'll you'll come on to like episode six and set up something that you know wasn't there so you have  to go back and open up one and two and figure out how to make those kind of set that up and yeah it's  very painful and you know long and boring does seem like that's the work part i guess yeah that's  the work part do you always write in script form i'm so weird like i'll put something in script form 
[01:53:30]  but i have to actually fucking hand write dialogue in a notebook for some reason works a lot better  for me no we're not like russell crowe in a beautiful mind we're just oh did he do that  let me explain what that was that was a nobody desperately trying to think that he has the same  process as somebody in season three oh yeah i do notebooks too oh really oh good i'm on the right  track god am i a flop he just oozes with self-confidence accuracy nothing worse than false  self-confidence but that's interesting though i would never have thought to do it that way 
[01:54:00]  yeah um to write it as a full script because you think of shows like the wire the sopranos they do  episodes or they write the entire arc for each character and then put it together  maybe i'll ask somebody from that show i'm just going to promote a film i'm asking about how  other people at hbo have done things i want to ask danny i want to ask danny about the beastie  boys video there oh yeah how much fun was that that was insane i mean uh who'd you have again i  mean yeah you me uh seth elijah wood and then there was will jack black jack black john c reilly uh 
[01:54:30]  orlando bloom uh i mean there was yeah ted danson jason schwartzman i mean every dance yeah  it was nuts unbelievable yeah you guys figured out that whole viral video thing and where you  don't have to deal with the executives that funnier die site is great yeah they got a lot of good stuff  on there yeah yeah the beastie boys video was so surreal though i remember seth and i exchanging  phone calls after we had got asked to do it and then both of us are just there just tripping out the 
[01:55:00]  whole entire time it was like every hour a brand new star comes on and we're just there watching  what was the video what did you do in the video it's like a continuation of the fight for your  right to party video it picks up right after the party's over with yeah oh so it's an acted piece  not a music okay it's like mixed in it's like thriller you know yeah you know just like thrill  remember ola ray she was the hot chicken uh thriller that was kind of being date raped before the  zombies saved her that makes any sense he slipped her a mickey and then the dead people came mickey 
[01:55:30]  yeah i'll see ya that's the end of the video what a great idea it really is god damn it that's a  fucking creative good idea what's that 30 minutes that's a long song  wow this is 30 minutes long yeah it's like a little little mini movie wow that's a short like  thriller you guys got a video on youtube 30 million uh three million views for a 30 minute video wow 
[01:56:00]  how did you get how did you get 30 minutes on youtube i thought you could only do 10 minutes  well it's the beastie boys yeah and they're stars they're not regular joes like us oh they call up  youtube and go hey guess what we're gonna give you 30 minutes they're like take yourself make sure no one  else is allowed to upload for the next two days or we'll put it on something else yeah sure i wonder  if that's also so movies can't be pirated and uploaded full no they just want to save their  bandwidth or people would just be uploading nonsense all the time right is your movie out by the way 
[01:56:30]  uh it comes out august 12th yeah week from friday we should talk about the guy huh elijah  wood's such a little guy yeah he really is he's slight of frame what a little fella he is  i'd actually tussle his hair like ah come here you we had him in i i couldn't believe how down  earth the guy very pleasant guy nice guy uh 30 minutes or less we haven't done the movie justice  we should talk about this a little more well it's with danny it's with uh nick swartzen who's also  very funny and uh of course jesse eisenberg who's great and uh and aziz and sorry who's you know on 
[01:57:00]  fucking uh parks and recreation and selling out theaters and he's hugely popular  i like to drive a fucking pen into my hand like luca brazzi as i'm describing his resume  it bothers you a little bit no it's it's yes and no it's like you always have a love hate thing  because it's like they are funny guys so it's like i'm happy to see funny guys getting work because it  like gives you faith like all right at least it's funny people working and not shitheads yeah like 
[01:57:30]  when you see shitheads succeeding it stinks but it's funny guys in the movie it's like all right well  that's that feels fair i think aziz uses notebooks too he writes notebooks too he does he's a little  weirdo because i see him all the time at the comedy cellar and he'll actually have his headphones on  he he fucking works he's not lazy and he'll sit there and jot things down from his headphones  and for the next set like i did years ago before i just finally realized it's over  but we love doing radio i do no i actually do love doing radio i'd say actually to really convince  myself how liar i am this business gets no respect is our problem daddy yeah yeah that really is 
[01:58:00]  we're the shit of the entertainment business yeah we really are it's just it's where other people come  until they get really successful yeah then they never again want to uh set foot or when hollywood's  done with them then they go yeah yeah yeah so on the way up and on the way down that's that's where  we're really not making him want to come back i know that's i don't apply for an internship are you  guys oh we're not allowed to have any we're not yeah we're not allowed to have that was an incident 
[01:58:30]  yeah oh that's nice we're we're a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah that's what we are we just we have very  big celebrities come in and then we say negative things about ourselves and naturally they don't  want to come back we're just busting balls it's like being on a first date and saying to a girl rape  that's ever been said seriously i would hope not yeah by some defense attorney you know even  fucking public defendant he doesn't want to take the case ever babe come on so um all right so 
[01:59:00]  four very funny guys and jesse plays the guy that they strap the bomb to and what the thing is he's  a pizza delivery guy he goes and you and um nick grab him yes and you want to force him to kill your  father or get money to hire a assassin force him to kill the father would be the easiest plan but  instead we force him to rob a bank so i can pay a hitman to do it was there is it explained why you  don't just force him to kill the father and then blow them both up it's not no but that would have been 
[01:59:30]  they should have used the notebooks and uh wrote that figured that out figured that whole thing  out that probably would cut out a lot of the funnier parts if you just went straight to the murder  yeah i don't think jesse has the murderer instinct in him yeah a lot harder to get somebody to kill  someone than to rob a bank oh under duress there you go you're absolutely right and uh so i was i  i almost said to him so what happens meaning how does it end and i realized what a dumb thing  please just spoil it for everyone could you just do that yeah this is you realize larry king wasn't  as bad at what he did as i thought he was i must fucking ask that question so seriously does he die 
[02:00:00]  at the end all kidding aside goddamn fool uh oh right they're dressed in uh a gorilla and an ape  which one is you i'm the i'm the uh i'm the ape nick is the uh is the little chimp yeah did you  actually have to film those scenes or was somebody uh standing that's actually us in a hundred degree  weather wearing monkey masks and but they could just put anyone in there you're a big star now  yeah well not anyone has those hands you know yeah yeah people would be like that physique 
[02:00:30]  i could tell i would i would hate it especially if you drank coffee then you have to smell your own  breath on the inside of a fucking monkey mask oh yeah they get pretty ranked by the end of the  shoot they do right it's pretty smelly wouldn't you hate to wear somebody else's fucking monkey mask  how awful would that be right there where the mouth is your nose would be yeah smelling somebody that has  that fucking sweet plaque breath all the time they actually only had one of each of those masks and  so there you know when you when the stand-in would have to come they'd set the shot they would put the 
[02:01:00]  mask on and there were definitely a few times where they hand the mask back to you and it's just soaking  wet oh yeah see you just don't think of that stuff i would have made them hold it just  fucking hold that thing against your face yeah just stand there and hold it absolutely you're not  putting my thing on to be in a major motion picture i would give a fuck i'd share condoms to be in a movie 
[02:01:30]  it's easy to talk shit when you're here come on danny why don't you tolerate that  that's actually a really cool fucking uh is that the uh the poster for it that's the trailer  i don't know aunt jim is it and stupid question sorry jimmy is you're a disaster today he's hurting  on himself i literally had no sleep at all i was playing chess till two in the morning on 
[02:02:00]  fucking chess with friends and i couldn't sleep that's i remember when you used to tell horrid  stories of prostitution and now you play chess yeah i was playing with a transsexual who was  fucking me oh okay which was so hard see if he was cheating behind still sitting on the picture  i suspected he was getting text advice from another friend so is there anything we're missing  with the movie because i don't want to not i honestly don't want i don't want to sell the  i'm looking forward to it uh it is really really funny it's an awesome movie it uh you know ruby 
[02:02:30]  and a lot of his inspiration for this are things like dog day afternoon and nice heat and all these  crazy bank robber movies and throwing a little comedic spin on it so it's definitely you know  something that's you haven't seen before do you guys have you do you guys have is there anybody  there that has like a sunny vibe you know maybe there's a leon in the uh oh yeah barber chair yeah  leon uh no you're not dying danny you're killing everyone around you you can do leon shirmer all day  so all right it comes out what the fucking uh week from friday i you never want to sell a movie short

[02:08:00]  that in there we were just like me and my wife like wow this lady the kid got a rod it's the first  his first handy wow the fetishes he's gonna have a fucking sonograms i can't get an erection unless  you just rub this thing over my stomach so it's a long story when you see your kid for the first  time in the belly they always go you want to know the sex and as soon as you say yes they go all  right here's the dick wow they go right for the fucking private area and say there you go that's  pretty much how they do it that really is the only way i know i know but they're gonna tell but but 
[02:08:30]  instead of maybe they just say it they're like okay you want to know and you know all of a sudden  this dick pops up on the screen like oh i guess it's gonna be a boy do they show you or do they tell  you they show you oh they don't tell you boy or girl they know they go all right were you kind of happy  you as a son was your wife kind of want a daughter or you guys didn't everyone says they don't care  because you kind of have to say we were cool whatever but there were i was the first born in  my family so i kind of wanted to weirdly just replicate that so i was hoping to get a boy get  the boy out of the way and then it doesn't matter i think they're creepy looking in there actually i 
[02:09:00]  don't want a girl it would be great if it's a daughter and you start screaming what the  fuck this is i'm not interested i want to make a big scene in the fucking room when i when i found out  when i was a boy one of my friends was like if it's a boy you only have to worry about one dick if  it's a girl you have to worry about all the dicks in the world wow you know what a great way to to  look at it you know it's funny too about naming things i've always been bad about i've made gender  errors my whole life believe me my first cat was uh was a manx who was a a boy but i thought it was a 
[02:09:30]  girl so i named him uh uh susan but then it turned out wow this makes total sense turned out it was a  fucking boy so i had to name him john and then i found a cat outside who i thought was a boy so i  named her william and then uh turned out it was a girl i've made gender errors with both of my cats  yeah that's actually that's actually the theme of the show and out out the window of your saturn  too apparently of course exactly at least i didn't pay one of the cats to blow me and pretend i didn't  see fucking scruff on the side how awful that is to hand over fifty dollars didn't realize you've been 
[02:10:00]  duped i'd love to fucking just yell at a tranny can i speak to your manager please this is not  what i was promised duped yeah false i was humiliating hey uh before we let you go case  swiss you enjoying that campaign too that campaign is a lot of fun you know when they came to us with  that uh jody and i were very apprehensive about it like well i don't know this there's not really a  point of reference for where this has worked before right and they uh gave us these scripts and it was 
[02:10:30]  like just as filthy as our show was and so uh yeah it was just a fun way to kind of take the  character outside the show and just be able to have some fun with them and we shot the new ads  right before we started shooting this season so it was a nice way to kind of get the feet wet again  get back in there right what's case swiss he's doing a whole campaign with case swiss is kenny powers  oh okay yeah you'd love it jim i would check them out they're great you do some edgy stuff though  man everything you don't do any soft comedies everything you're in has got some balls to it which is nice 
[02:11:00]  to see until until i have this kid yeah it'll be all about like you know it's about the children  now why say fuck when you can say friggin can i ask you about that what do you what do you feel  about comedies in general i mean are we starting it seems like we're starting to move you know  toward edgy again finally yeah i mean that's how i like comedy i mean i like uh i like to see rated  art comedy i like to go in there and know that anything is on the table you know i feel like when  it's a pg-13 comedy not that they're not good pg-13 comedies there are but you know you kind of 
[02:11:30]  feel like you're going in there and you know that they're only going to be able to take it so far  yeah yeah i like a nice r and and x for a while there they got rid of the whole comedy genre and it  was rom-coms that's where that's where the where the comedies went yeah there weren't the  fucking movies for just i hate to say but just guys we talk about those where the guy and the girl  back to back leaning with their arms crossed looking at each other like all right right we  know what's going on with you and she's like oh boy i know you and then they'll uh you know they'll 
[02:12:00]  meet they'll have to like each other for some reason where they're not really liking each other right  and then they'll really like each other but and then something will break them apart and then they'll  realize how much they like each other back together movies over but for a while that's all for a while  that's all they were making they didn't have a down and dirty comedy i don't think matthew  mcconney's ever taken a picture facing another woman on a on a movie let me tell you  oh god there you go there you go i actually want to make a movie cover like that where the guy and

[02:20:00]  that is tomorrow right that's tomorrow one day away from ask for a raise  day bring it up again can we have some kind of production around this no you can't have any  can we have some production no should that on every every wednesday it's sam's ask for a raise day 
[02:20:30]  that's the day by the way where he goes into the bosses right and has to ask them for a raise as he  was instructed to do right because how we saw it do that yeah and i think we're pretty accurate maybe  maybe maybe we're a little off but we see it this way you've been told to ask for a raise every  week right everyone knows that by now because out of nowhere they were very surprised that you  wanted a raise right they thought you were happy with the money you were making and they actually 
[02:21:00]  said to you sam that you're not asking for a raise enough yeah it's a skewed retelling of events so  now we have uh come up with this once a week you get to go into the office and ask for a raise and  now we want production value around it yeah as a reminder everything needs production it's a reminder  to you to them so it's not uncomfortable when you go in and ask actually i really want an over  the top big production yeah yeah i mean i appreciate we don't have to spend hours on it but just you  know that that fucking hollywood type music like big action movie trailer and then today is 
[02:21:30]  ask for a raise day with sam roberts it's just strange that and you say that this way it won't be  uncomfortable when actually just having a conversation about a production piece let alone  having a production piece would in fact make it much more uncomfortable i think it would let every  but all the parties know that this is coming like breaks the ice for that week but it's not you're  coming in to ask for the raise that you've been instructed to ask for no i have not been instructed 
[02:22:00]  to do that i heard yeah we all heard that from you is we heard obviously i'm telling you that they  told you that you haven't asked for a raise enough and that's why you don't have a raise and they  basically said come in once a week to ask for your raise no they didn't tell me to do that what's  wrong with you man you're ungrateful what do you mean i'm ungrateful we're trying to help you out  you're not trying to help me absolutely trying to help you out you do five radio shows now you  deserve a raise and now we're going to go with uh a production piece no there's no reason over the 
[02:22:30]  top no way what do you want in this production piece pop and circumstance i'd like a little  circumstance more than the pomp but um a little pomp a little pomp in there though but you want  more about any pomp right like a martini very dry though right right right right right the pomp is  the vermouth yeah but if you're gonna drink a martini it should go dry yeah i want you maybe  with a little little pomp a lot of circumstance making a dirty martini dirty could i have a dirty  martini i want you both to know this won't help at all what are you talking about tomorrow 
[02:23:00]  is ask for a raise day no it's not a day it's not something we celebrate it's oh you know no  problem when we have the sex buzzer when iraq arrives but when it comes to you that's right  good point well the sex buzzer doesn't affect iraq economically 551 oh yeah it does when they  551 it was 551 i love how he made an effort where it was like 445 really it was five i mean  5 45 oh 551 it was 551 the purpose of the sex buzzer is to prove to everybody that iraq does get 
[02:23:30]  here on time no but it's gonna hurt him financially because the bosses are realizing that he's he's  kind of lazy eric they hear they hear lazy when they realize that he came in at 551 yeah yeah it's  not he's not a go-getter in the morning that's that's what it is but so eric is not searching  everything we've done for you right now you're very ungrateful tomorrow is ask for a raise it's  not you're gonna get your ass into steve blatter's office once again why would you say i'm in his 
[02:24:00]  name and it's gonna be let's wednesday should be the day right no if you want to make it tuesday  that's fine it's not a day today no i don't want it any day what day should it be in uh we were  thinking tuesday or wednesday yeah oh carolina man wants lasers so we got the circumstance more  circumstance than pomp and we need lasers so a lot of circumstance some pomp and lasers and a 
[02:24:30]  big voice guy with with just enough echo yeah i mean sirius xm has the voice guy we'll be able to  do that but i mean the whole idea is bad why is it bad do you have a racer oh you got it no but i  mean that's not to be are you underpaid sir it's not to be discussed are you sam roberts underpaid  at sirius xm satellite radio if you don't say yes they're just going to take that as well he's fine  well i mean i i believe i have a certain value that but regardless of what that value paid or not 
[02:25:00]  sam roberts it's not to be discussed on the air that's really not a public thing why wouldn't they  want this discussed on the air this is good radio and it just knows it lets them know that you  aren't really happy uh being here right but oh i mean saying that so publicly wouldn't be the  type of statement that i would want to make oh really not so publicly i'm more of a behind  the scenes guy a worm a worm is a good name a worm and people are confused when we say pomp 
[02:25:30]  we're not talking about troy's hair so pompadour and circumstance yeah yeah lightning strikes  in this production piece some lightning strikes uh what do you want in your production piece sam  i actually want it to be muted like for there not to be a production piece at all that ain't happening  at this point we're gonna do and if they don't hit over a production piece we'll make our own every  fucking wednesday on the spot why wednesday we're gonna do this for you don't worry because  these guys are lazy most of them take off thursdays and fridays even though they make us 
[02:26:00]  work five days a week i've seen them in here on thursday and friday we have one of the guys decided  that this is the perfect week to take vacation everybody's entitled to a vacation but if you run  the channel when you take vacation when the show takes vacation that made me laugh my ass off when i saw  that uh email i was like i did not even notice i wouldn't have noticed you were gone um just makes it  just makes it easier to get out of the building yeah get out of the building i just thought i just  thought he hadn't come down the hall or something like i don't know nothing i come in here we do the 
[02:26:30]  show and the show comes off without a hitch and he's not here so what's the difference with him being  here or not being here right you want some wild guitar solo in your production piece we need i want  danny mcbride to have stayed longer oh do you want a record scratch in the middle it goes and then  it's like some dramatic talking and then bam that's a good idea those are all good production  elements but i prefer if the content i i my issue is not so much cash register sounds yes we need 
[02:27:00]  money sounds but don't do pink floyd money that's been overused no no we got to come up with our own  yeah yeah i like that and maybe get money make a list make a list sam we're all about this now money  counter from scarface with the music playing behind it take it to the limit take it to the limit  yeah i like that and then play clips of sam complaining about his money right no right this  is i don't do that production piece yeah find uh audio of sam complaining about how he's underpaid 
[02:27:30]  that's perfect yeah it'd be great if you didn't uh so tomorrow is sam's ask for a raise day no it's  going to happen every wednesday because no it's not going to how it was told to us you're not asking  for a raise enough so now we're making it official every wednesday oh yeah you ask for a raise no  i'm not going to do that and then we get a full report on thursday morning this is horrible this is  going to become a huge thing no it won't all right what do we got some movie clips like uh how about 
[02:28:00]  how about oliver going please sir may i have some more i like it and then it goes in yeah i like it  yeah clip from oliver asking for more so what do we got so far uh uh tom cruise yelling show me the  money uh show me you want a whole montage of hollywood money yeah yeah it could be a couple of  those in there now you don't have to go overboard but just a few people are suggesting we go rom-com  with this we go rom-com you're gonna create a trailer well how about take this job and shove it  oh even that's a good oh yeah there's gotta be a demand in there if you don't get your raise soon 
[02:28:30]  you're walking i love that no you know i love that this is a tactic that's been tried before  i love that idea and i'm not i i believe that if we're gonna put a time limit on it you are so  getting a raise from this no you know what will happen put you over the top you'll lose a producer  from this no reasonable down the hall i say i say this is the month where they put up or or you walk  that's your statement that's not mine august has begun so by the end of august if you don't have a raise 
[02:29:00]  you're telling these motherfuckers you're walking hey that's a good thing my way of the highway  that's right do it just fucking give them an ultimatum why because you'll win when you go in  there when you go in there tomorrow for to ask for your raise for how many times have you asked for a  raise so far since we started this at least a dozen times i don't know how many weeks has it been it's  been at least a dozen times but tomorrow is ultimatum day tomorrow is not oh yeah oh that's kind of  good right there what as salisbury hill plays uh sam roberts is seriously broke 
[02:29:30]  in the comedy of the summer that'd be good uh-huh yeah i mean i'm a clip of uh very good frank from  connecticut uh clips of sam's mom talking about how hard uh sam works oh that's good yes the little  sam's mom in there she thinks i'm a good worker but that's good she's not she doesn't make these  decisions and so tomorrow is definitely ultimatum day no it's not it's time i get you tell those 
[02:30:00]  motherfuckers ultimatum days the race doesn't come by the end of august you're out of here so you got  options just say you got options i don't have the options go go have you been paying attention to  the podcast world exactly well that's where i'm heading unless i get my raise  ultimatum day a podcast from the guy who used to be a producer on a successful show oh yeah don't  worry they'll they'll give it to you you want the million dollar man song that's a good idea because 
[02:30:30]  you know sam likes wrestling eric on long island a million dollar man money money you want a wrestling  theme in there i like wrestling theme music again the content is my issue what would you like  i would like for no no i know what you're gonna say but this is happening so now you got to realize  yeah you got to work with it yeah you got to work with it i would what i would like is maybe some  type of a raise obviously that's why we're doing that's not what i was gonna say you're very ungrateful  sam very ungrateful maybe like some type of uh notice ahead of time saying like this statement is not 
[02:31:00]  matched by sam roberts like these are and i want you also to take on the cause of the rest of the guys  behind the scenes yeah basically saying look if if if if everyone doesn't get a raise i'm walking  why would i do that because then you need a leader yeah you're norma ray why would i be the leader  you're norma ray yeah i don't care about these guys nah you gotta all stick together that's right  and then you'll be like you know the sacrificial lamb if something does god forbid happen so what are 
[02:31:30]  you doing tomorrow tomorrow i'll come in for this show and then what no host after  opening anthony live then uh get audible together then on the hall uh write a show description  then do a little research for hits one after the show duties are over with then then i'll head to  the parking lot and then home no you got to go down the hall see they told you they didn't tell me 
[02:32:00]  at this point it's your problem you don't have a raise because you're not doing what they told you  to do which is to ask for a raise every week and you're only doing the minimum when you do go down  there to ask for a raise you got to ultimate days with this ultimatum with a big fucking the big  sounder we're gonna do for you the idea of talking to them was more in the spirit of let's try to work  together and keep things you know quiet as opposed to and tell them this every week that goes by that  you don't get a raise the production piece gets bigger and bigger well you just four hour production 
[02:32:30]  for me during the show i'm so in okay i'm starting to think that you guys are just trying to figure  out ways that you can do less show no we've done that no we are expensive push that as much as we can  sam tomorrow's ultimatum yeah can't wait tomorrow is asked for a raise day and hopefully tomorrow we  got something that looks like a production piece that we can start with this whole thing is not  working out well i think it's great you want tuesdays i there is no day it's more casual wednesday  right it yeah wednesday is good midweek nice middle of the week then we get a full report on thursday 
[02:33:00]  i'll tell you what i will do i will go down uh and talk to uh management today to apologize for this  break oh you don't have to that's what i'll do exactly they know they owe you  is that what happens you have to apologize for now it does why well because did they tell you to  keep this off the air as much as possible well i don't want them if we get an inkling that they 
[02:33:30]  said that it gets a lot worse right well i'm not going to tell you if they do say that did they say  that to you no is that what the problem is here because we noticed your balls are a little smaller  today no they didn't say that but you're like a scaredy cat you've made a mockery of the whole thing  what happened to your big fucking balls i want them to know that i'm not the one making the  mockery was there a day sam wasn't there a day on this show all right where you told us that they  had asked you to go down there and ask them for a raise every uh week no i didn't you didn't say that 
[02:34:00]  i said was there something said that they didn't realize how important and then you said they wanted  you to ask for a raise every week no it was simply said that i had not spoken to them privately about  said about financial issues not after the fact when they started lambasting you where did this story  come from that you were to ask for a raise every week it came from you i should be speaking to them 
[02:34:30]  more often about my my qualms instead of bringing it to the air brought up on this program ask every  week i don't think i said that on the air oh i don't know i didn't i didn't say it but i would  like to find tape but if you have a qualm that's that should be good enough right it should but that  means you got a storm coming oh dolly part nine to five i like it what a way to make a living oh  we're not too flat it's a good song oh way to make a yeah that's good tiny balls right now i saw that 
[02:35:00]  in the theaters i don't think it'll help our purpose my friend dean and i went to the movies  and saw nine to five with dolly parton and dabney coleman dabney coleman dabney did you find it funny  we did and then dean and i had a nice meal together yeah and his father was stoned and picked us up  from the movie theater for this drunk friend oh footer's on the line oh good really  yeah footer it's a good song it is a good song what's up hey uh i think maybe what we could do 
[02:35:30]  is um we can all start by calling up steve blatter if you just let him know how we feel stop saying  his name it's kind of weird sam's saying that but he's nodding his head up and down i'm not moving  he's winking he's nodding yes he's fist pumping we know we know that like what he really wants don't  worry sam we got this you played your way with your voice but we see we see all the signs i have a good  relationship with the people down the hall i wouldn't do something like this what does this  mean i don't know what you're doing what is that what is the fist you thrust your fist up in the air 
[02:36:00]  thrusting a fist up in the air your hand in the crook of your uh arm like that by your bladder in  your stomach yeah what does that i'm not doing that so i don't know what it means oh we get it yeah we  get the wink and everything all right don't make it now he's doing the okay sign with his fingers  going yeah and and now he's yep we got it bring it you're going bring it yes it's cool no i'm not 
[02:36:30]  i'm trying to read sam you want a lollipop what no i'm not making emotion at all is that  kenny can get you a lollipop why no i don't want any then why is your cheek popping out like that as  your hand goes back and forth my cheek is not popping out you mean why is his tongue to bulge out  his cheek as he moves his hand back and forth i'm not you want a lollipop no thank you i mean  i'll take one if you have one but that's not what i was i wasn't asking you march down there tomorrow  like they told you to they didn't tomorrow's ask for a raise day you're confused what happened your 
[02:37:00]  bulls i would like to hear uh audio of who who first said that i think it was sam i don't think so  let me just hold on sam wrote this down  stop this shit because that fucking bladder is going to complain that's holy shit wow he does  have balls when he's writing shit yeah jim is looking at a blank piece of paper for the record  that's right it's your contract that's about right uh well you know what kyle in boston 
[02:37:30]  kyle go ahead oh phone calls i was wondering uh you think the listeners could do their own  production pieces maybe best one oh mr norton what a great idea that is listeners do the  production if the listeners want to send in their uh uh how we say this sam asked for a raise wednesday  yeah sam roberts asked for a raise wednesday promos promos we're now accepting them from the 
[02:38:00]  listeners right you show the better ones on the show whatever it takes don't send them to me  because if you do they'll never get through op anthony at serious xm.com yeah let her be anthony  at serious xm.com no and in that address op what do you think any any email listeners can help you  then yeah none of you guys are better no this is no we're helping you this is trust me this whole thing  is not helpful trust me total help because now we're going to get a shitload of production pieces  man you're going to have a raise by the end of the month yep no i won't or you're walking or you 
[02:38:30]  walk i'll probably be sent walking after this no why will they why do they turn it around and  always blame you yeah is that what you're trying to tell us today no well in the case of the last  whatever 20 minutes or so of radio i could see where they would be upset why and now they're  going to take it out of you yeah well yes i don't know because we'll see you encouraged us right  before we went on the air you said let's talk about the race thing could you guys and we were like  fuck man we got shit we want to get really man there's but you were like to talk about i need a 
[02:39:00]  raise bad and these motherfuckers you know can you guys push it and i'll make it like and i'll make  it like i didn't want to do it i'll play coy you didn't say that during i'll play coy no i never said  that before my life no matter what i say keep pumping you said i remember that part too no matter how  much i protest keep pumping because i got to save my own ass you gave it away though and fuckers got it  what you gave it away they know it's a lie because you said we got shit we want to get to  oh that's true oh god should imply preparation shit so see i'm gonna now go and say hey just so you 
[02:39:30]  know that was all them i had wow i had nothing to do with this i know i know what you're saying  i've heard rumors of the electric shock around here is it bad they will assume that they  fucking uh put the electric uh things on your bullies that half of what you've been saying  are lies but they will assume that at least part of it was egged on by me behind the scenes i get  you sam you see that's the problem no we got it you want them to flood your don't worry you want 
[02:40:00]  them to flood your twitter at not sam i'll help you i yeah for what oh you said yeah you can flood  my twitter all you want saying at not sam flood my twitter all day let management know how don't  talk to management just flood my twitter let management know through your twitter at not sam  no just you could talk to me i'll talk back to you we'll have a conversation but leave everybody  else in it too yeah why would you well so they know sirius xm would help too no yeah that would 
[02:40:30]  be really good wow okay also could use that when the uh online feed shits the bed yeah well the  online feed you do whatever you want with that but oh wow so what time tomorrow around noon you walk in  there and and put your demands on the table i don't think i'm going to i can't wait this is such a big day  yeah i'm not no tomorrow's gonna be do you dress differently on wednesdays when you have to ask  for a raise suit tie no i did there's many things wrong with that statement so i just say no  you know overall no so you don't remember if we get an inkling that they don't like this 
[02:41:00]  conversation it gets a lot worse why would they like this conversation because it's fun radio it is  fun radio bosses i can we're talking to a lot of people right now and for fun radio you should be  compensated right properly that's not like now right well we'll hook you up don't worry we'll  take care of you i appreciate that so we want to move on but tomorrow has officially become the day  you always ask for a raise every wednesday you ask for a raise well see that makes me think that 
[02:41:30]  tomorrow is the ultimatum day which means you don't you give them to the end of august or you're  walking walking and you're taking the whole staff with what's that he's holding up with you i'm not  holding anything rule ah that's cool i mean i'm a fan of the show but not in this respect and  production pieces are gonna start being uh made by the listeners it's bad and we're gonna be playing  them not just on wednesdays by the way it's gonna be great every you're gonna love this they're gonna  love it every day they're gonna realize wow this is where we should be putting our money right yeah i 
[02:42:00]  mean should i bring in some more content is that the problem that i need to bring in some more stuff  for you guys no no this this takes precedence you're doing you're doing this was a precedence  over yes oh yeah the time you would take doing that spend it marching down that hall and asking  for a raise demanding that's right why are you always asking why why does he have to work with  his hat in his hand yeah how about you demand or you leave i like that i like it okay the what's  the uh what's the uh date sam i'm not giving it's 31st i'm not giving out steve blatter's  fucking email why would you say his name and i'm not doing that i'm just uh i'm loving getting lots 
[02:42:30]  of twitter responses so oh good and there's hashtags and what are they saying anything good  um this one simply says hashtag serious xm east side sam oh now that would imply that they would  let you go yes that this is this is the road you're sending me down they don't realize you  i'm not reading that what did dave want dave wanted 50 bucks a week and they wouldn't do that for him  dave wanted a lot more than 15 dollars a week no he wanted 50 a week you're fucked dave wanted a 
[02:43:00]  lot more they just wanted bus fare to continue the show with ron and fez he just needed a little  transportation right to and from the job coke logic is not helping me at all what did he say his uh  fezzy fucking animation is terrific the fez thing is um sam's in that by the way yeah right there  should be worth a few extra bucks well maybe coke logic should pay me then no no the bosses oh and  this one just says uh at not sam please die with a heart so i mean that doesn't help anyone well i 
[02:43:30]  mean the heart helps it out yeah makes it all nice i love that fucking email though i forgot to tell you  i'll be on vacation this week i forgot to notice holy shit  uh and are they closing off these little hallways on purpose to keep us from running around  like rats in a maze looking over the elevator cheese i don't know they put up the giant acs

[02:48:00]  to drive friday morning and come back sunday morning it's a six-hour drive who the fuck does  that unless they're poor that wasn't the point of the cape cod story you took friday off but you  weren't allowed to drive thursday because you couldn't afford a hotel remember that sam cursing  out man that day we love that motherfuckers those fucking cocksuckers yeah we left early friday  morning and the point of that story why didn't you leave thursday because you took friday off  well because it would cost an action i know exactly but which you can't afford the point of that story 
[02:48:30]  was to tell you about my nice if you're doing five radio shows for a company you should be able to  afford a thursday night hotel room in cape cod yes but by that psychology they could just as easily say  all right well you can't do any more radio shows anymore then can i ask you something when did you  arrive at cape cod on friday it was about 12 30 or one o'clock and when did you leave cape cod and be  honest sunday at maybe 10 or 11 in the morning how long have arrived well it was six hours there because

[03:09:00]  fuck up and drive the fucking bus oh that's good that's that's you need to shut the fuck up and  drive the fucking bus well her music is probably playing on her fucking phone was it pushing headphones  or was she blasting it out in public no she was blasting it out it was i think it was a ringtone  thing that she was like but how loud could a phone get oh well who knows  drive the fucking bus you guys got a fucking problem you are a miserable old  fucking man you miserable 
[03:09:30]  you fucking want to tell me what the fuck to do shut the fuck up and drive your bus  and you listen to the rules about that you stupid fuck i ain't playing no fucking boombox i'm  bothering nobody you are a fucking hater you are a hater you are a hater i ain't bothering nobody i'm  getting off you know i'm getting off right now he's a hater apparently oh of course who's in the room 
[03:10:00]  well the woman the woman yeah i think the stupid person i think the stupid um lady  you know what it is because she's acting like a typical fucking yeah lunatic yeah i mean here's  the thing this piece of shit fucking woman it's one of those things where it's like i before the story  started i knew she was a crazy lady yeah i just knew it oh yeah um and it's just no one is surprised 
[03:10:30]  just hearing that oh i can't see her but um i can just tell by the voice that she's a typical  fucking crazy lady exactly it's exactly what i was thinking when i first heard this yeah and saw the video  honky stop it right there i have issue with the word you know what you know what you gotta 
[03:11:00]  ban the h word first of all honky is the dumbest fucking word it hurts sam we gotta we gotta  fucking ban that and you notice she's and i've noticed this in a lot of these videos it instantly  gets racist on the on the other side like the bus driver's just going shut it shut up shut the phone  off shut it he didn't call her anything i'm sure he was thinking it but if he had it would be  oh then he would have been fired yeah sensitivity training for the entire fleet of bus drivers that 
[03:11:30]  but she's able to just throw around racial epithets no matter how fucking ridiculous and  the fucking dated they are i'd have called her a mammy if i was called honky i would reply with mammy  because uh because it doesn't merit like the full blast but you gotta have a little  fun someone's gonna call like a honky at first i'd laugh and i go really well could you leave the 
[03:12:00]  bus mammy she would get really annoyed i think it would have escalated by the way huffington post  uh says the pussy news story because you guys were asking so yeah trying to do a little research is it's  true yeah if you go there if it's true how are they allowed to do that when everybody knows  the the uh the way that's being used and what the message is supposed to convey how come radio guys  can't go i effed her in the a and she sucked my c because those letters and the implication of those 
[03:12:30]  letters you know what they're trying to say you're not veiling it how is that allowed and that's exactly  what she was that's why the fucking media is so burn aliveable because they are able because they  they enjoy this uh this leniency from the fcc because what they're doing is supposed to be  important in a public service but it's not they're just tabloid pieces of garbage here's the rest of  the bus story and then maybe we'll get that  i don't want to see you i'd rather walk than see you you are a miserable old 
[03:13:00]  because she's fat

[03:17:00]  have any of those i have four what are you talking about from the last week i'm not going to play any  of those from last week of me on my own show all right um the regular list i couldn't give you  because the printers decided they didn't want to uh network with the computers so it's still sitting  on there but everything you asked for we got oh you why don't you just email it to yourself and  present over here you know what because uh they went to break and i ran down here so oh you didn't 
[03:17:30]  have time um all right well let me see should we just start with something um i usually you see what's  going on is i usually have a list yeah in uh in front of me but obviously the printers weren't  working and i was flustered because of the last hour of radio that left me uh in a very vulnerable  position but we'll see what happens i mean you know what this is the life i lead it's that's not  like i can complain about it i made my bed now i sleep in it isn't that right nagel that is true

[03:18:30]  on the mtv discussion of today to me i mean i know danny mcbride was great today we could talk  about danny mcbride how uh you know we got eastbound and down we got 30 minutes or less the guy has a  skyrocketing career we could talk about that we could talk about mtv being 30 years old and all the  stuff opie and anthony were talking about there's so many things we could talk about there's no reason 
[03:19:00]  to dwell eric on one topic i'm not dwelling in fact i have yet to bring it up you are the one  who constantly keeps no no no no what happened when i asked you about bits what did you bring up  well that was i was told by other people who told you the the people who host we mentioned we mentioned  names here open jim okay so you you thought you were going to cover them by saying the people who host  the show no i i was trying to pull a sam and just be a bit vague i'm not a vague person i'm a very 
[03:19:30]  direct person okay i'm glad you've learned your lesson listen uh mtv turned 30 years old and we were  talking about it today and talking about some of the uh uh original videos on mtv and i who are we  calling i'm trying to find roland since this is this bit's about him it is the mtv vj's no i'm not  oh all right you can just hang up on him i'm starting to think ahead he was walking out with  uh opi anyway trying to pitch guests i'm sure and opi was not listening to him at all but uh this is 
[03:20:00]  where i was getting at more and we will definitely i think even though it was an actor show moment a  little later on we should revisit roland uh talking to the original mtv vj's because it was one of the  most uncomfortable moments i've ever witnessed eric you were here for that right yes sam  what was that was with the delayed response uh because the phone rang from production oh i was  dealing with that too well why didn't you say hi this is eric you're on the air because you were on  a roll oh was i yes i had no idea just letting you go well thank you um what were you talking about 
[03:20:30]  uh you were here right when roland uh had his interview with the mtv people yes because uh you left  very uncomfortable we'll we'll get to that but first i wanted to honor uh it's the first  person to ever have two videos played on mtv not the first video but the first guy to ever have two  videos played uh we talked about him on the air a bit today as uh when mtv first started people were 
[03:21:00]  just sending videos in and uh whatever songs they had they'd play them like they weren't being  particular about what videos because they needed videos rod stewart was the guy who uh i think he had  like four or five videos in the first rotation of mtv very impressive and it helped him become a  defining figure in the 1980s we brought him into the new millennium with a guy who defined a homeless 
[03:21:30]  for a generation and that man is tippy tom yes i mean we all loved tippy tom we all miss him we've  talked about him many times before uh if you don't know who he is just google him up he was the  greatest homeless man who ever lived the greatest man maybe the greatest guest in the history of the  opian anthony show uh but he was a rod stewart fan and did his share of singing with that i give you  tippy tom as rod stewart on after opian anthony live this is what my body and you think i'm sexy 
[03:22:00]  come on baby let me know lonely you're damn right looking for the time of your life are you single  hygiene not an issue hepatitis c which i've had 20 years sit back slube up and dial tippy tom  he's homeless smells like a dumpster and he's horny can you lick my for a bottle of thunderbird he's 
[03:22:30]  all yours i'm a human being guys i'm a faggot i was a faggot two years old girls i had girlfriends too  he's so drunk he doesn't care all right who's next just name the place and he'll be there  we're out behind a dumpster or something like that call 1-900 syphilis for the ride of your life  i know how to shake my bed not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with tippy 
[03:23:00]  tom you're damn right eric that was wonderful and it's after opian anthony live where we're  listening to tippy tom in honor of uh of uh rod stewart who was the first guy to have multiple  videos played on mtv but why would you play the k-rock version um i do not  i thought we had the uh as we call it the xl version but this is the only one extreme language  well obviously that was the k-rock version but you got the gist uh we all love and miss tippy tom 
[03:23:30]  hey ron fezz intern no name is your name did you hear pips on the show yesterday on the after show i  mean i heard yep is that is that how you pips the ron and fezz intern came on the after show yesterday  and he alongside troy started talking about how they use and abuse women is that where you're at  too me uh i wouldn't say so no no no i have a girlfriend anyway yeah yeah she lives in kansas  she doesn't live in kansas now she lives back at home in jersey i brought her back 
[03:24:00]  you to bring her back yeah what do you mean you brought why wouldn't she just fly back  well she flew back with me because my mom works for the airline so she flies cheaper  but what about you i fly for free so you have to take a flight there and back to get her cheaper  airfare yeah why can't you just get her the cheaper air because it's got to be a companion yeah  huh that's really complicated i like the other guy's stories better well i mean i don't know what 
[03:24:30]  you want from me i don't use it i don't use and abuse women that's not well that's good to know i  just wanted to check have you been with a girl i would say i would say women pretty much abuse me  like mentally i would say your girlfriend does no well then who does just like women in general like  you know a tease is out there i mean i don't go i don't get too much into it and i've been with women  yeah i figured you had that the girlfriend thing tipped me off oh okay well that doesn't that doesn't  mean he's been with her i still one of these days i'm gonna get to the bottom of the wild days of 
[03:25:00]  sex bagel because that's what really intrigued me about yesterday's broadcast i've just had awkward  sex moments that's just how are they awkward oh look at somebody trying to uh move the subject along  go on answer eric's question okay well um uh i uh i had sex i had sex at an early age i was i would  say i was 15 when i first had sex and um eric this is i was always with the nasty girls that's 
[03:25:30]  what that was eric this is getting uncomfortable in here is it coming off as creepy no it's coming  off perfectly fine it's getting he's enjoying mars i heard him laughing i heard that that's mars isn't  it yeah that's mars mars this is coming off as creepy isn't it like yesterday it was kind of fun  and conversational and cool and now it's just kind of coming off weird isn't it just a little awkward  that's what i thought i'm gonna stop this conversation okay that's the right move isn't  it mars no well no now you're trying to sabotage me i'm afraid i'm afraid this conversation's over 
[03:26:00]  okay okay so you can go back so you have no more questions it's no that's it for you okay you can  go ahead and uh do the run and fast stuff but i appreciate you talking okay you did a great job  uh but i did want to while we're talking about the mtv vjs share a very uncomfortable moment that  happened with roland actually we're gonna share that moment later we should play an ona bit first  i feel it in my blood well there i have one from today that uh today i have one that i cut up today 
[03:26:30]  oh i was about to say we're not gonna play i'm not playing something earlier today i have something i  cut up earlier today going back on uh like this date in history from 2007 when we did what the  hell is that uh is it good it's got some really bizarre and creepy shit in it well what's going  on in this clip eric um i don't have a list one guy has some uh glass that he has in his head from  going through a windshield and they think that the glass is moving through his skin into his brain 
[03:27:00]  now that that intern's out of the studio that was getting weird wasn't it a little bit it was  i just wanted to see how far he'd go he's a creep huh he wants to talk in the worst way but he doesn't  have anything to say no but he wants the attention like pips he went to the mic and he immediately had  stuff to say yeah but that kid just is he's not in there with you is he no no that kid just wants  to who are you looking at then mars oh that kid just wants to talk but he's got nothing to say  but i think it's that he like what was the intern that was in here yesterday what was pips 
[03:27:30]  pips is confident he comes in you talk to him yeah i'll talk to you and he'll he'll tell a story  or whatever this one is no name right yeah no name wants to talk but nobody comes up to him  to talk yeah so once you brought him in there he he wants to be a part of everything but he doesn't  have anything to say he just starts spouting out very strange things like i didn't ask him about  losing his virginity at 15 i don't know what he was talking about but i'm glad that we put the  kibosh on that that could have been a good story no i don't think it was i think it was probably 
[03:28:00]  going to end somewhere where we would be criminally responsible for something so instead we move along  to celebrate this day and own a history uh not just with a production piece but we'll relive a couple of  moments with you it was 2007 so what's that four years ago now on this day that we celebrated and  we played a game that we call what the hell is that uh was dr steven here uh not for this one no 
[03:28:30]  this one was dr mike and we had that female doctor whose name is escaping me well i'm sorry to her  that you're not valuable enough for your name to be remembered by somebody like eric nagel but  we'll all remember you after we listen to this together it's what the hell is that four years  ago on this day on after opian anthony live after on a live let's go what do we got now we got josh  uh hey what's going on josh from boston all right boston all right what do you got there sir um well 
[03:29:00]  let's see we're not on the xm side here no so let let's put it this way um my my organ has  binocular vision oh oh you you have two where you should have one um uh where where you would  excrete uh liquid uh waste exactly to to the left of the the main uh eye shall we say yes uh there's 
[03:29:30]  just a little smaller one wow that is odd a doctor have you heard of this yeah i know exactly what it is  i'll show it to everyone all right this is going to be the one time of my wife where i wish i was  black i swear well don't worry about it one time in my wife in your wife yeah my wife you still have  a little freudian slip oh he never misspeaks oh no you did it touche man that's okay okay 
[03:30:00]  lochness monster i respect a good punch back he really does uh let's go well you're oh you're  nervous he has a mystical piece and i'll probably make bobby kelly look like john holmes so okay  here he uh goes he's um uh displaying now what's uh what seems to be the issue it's gonna make her  all right that's quite the position she's taken up she's kneeling uh in front of him getting a good  look well you can imagine what's going on by the laughter huh what's going on i said it looks 
[03:30:30]  beautiful to me it's oh a condition called hypospadias hypospadism oh and how is that  caused it's a congenital secondary growth of your urethra okay so it kind of exactly what he said  split off and uh there's no repercussions from this it doesn't have to be corrected  bad aim bad aim okay in the morning sometimes i'll destroy a toilet 
[03:31:00]  question does pepsi come out one and coke the other no i think it's rum and coke does it does  it separate like that though like you can be like hey check this out look over here i don't know can  can you control which one comes out what if i could i'd be in movies right now yeah yeah it's true  so uh obviously your whole life has been like that but uh uh is is one um larger than the other  yes the uh the the main one is much larger much larger than the second one okay and this doesn't 
[03:31:30]  affect you um sexually no it doesn't actually uh women have never said anything but the women i've  been with really haven't been in a position to say anything oh okay they've never said it to your  face i got you talking behind your back both eyes right okay uh people some people are suggesting  the treatment is spackle doctor surgery unfortunately what about what about a wine cork  yeah oh very tiny wine cork all right but there is a surgical procedure that could if you wanted 
[03:32:00]  to uh saw that slightly increased risk of infection oh there is okay never had an infection i'm not  letting a knife go down there don't you worry about you wish i've already had a knife down there  once that was enough for me all right all right all right listen listen running out of show over  here so we gotta move on we gotta move all right very good well who do we got next there  who's who's up doug we have all right what's up doug how you doing i'm doug uh i don't have a problem 
[03:32:30]  like that i mean i sort of know what my problem is i'm another head guy i got a i got a lump on my  head here wow and uh you know to me it's normal i've been living with it i i know how i got it i got  in a head-on collision oh i wasn't wearing my seat belt so i was good for a year i thought it was  good they sewed it up and then little pieces of uh glass started coming out so i was uh you know  i'd be scratching my head and a little tiny piece of glass would come out and then i went to the 
[03:33:00]  barber and i get my head shaved and there was a piece sticking out old italian man he's retired now  and i said you know i told him i might have a problem shaving my head that he's like oh don't worry  about it he shaves my head he puts hot rags on there and he when he's done he starts pushing  out and the piece of glass he pushed out is uh got it made me a little nervous and this is it's you  know a free pretty decent sized piece of that was in your scalp that i was holding around it's the 
[03:33:30]  size of an aspirin right a little bigger a nice a nice tylenol gel he had the last mimsy come out of  you know i had that in my head for 10 years and i was wondering maybe i think i still may have a  piece in there and i was wondering maybe if it would change into something better than windshield  yeah yeah and my barber by the way told me you know he said f doctors you don't need doctors you  come oh you got the barber he's got it but he's retired now so let's explain you know you got a  shaved head and the the the bump is that how big guys would you say on the head marble size 
[03:34:00]  it's got a little extension off of it yeah very oddly shaped it was it was bigger before this piece  here hey would you get that shirt out of the hamper a rat right your assistant to the assistant  manager at the movie theater kind of sound like the moan my friend all right so what what do we  think uh dr mike retained foreign body he's still coming out he needs to see someone to make sure  there's nothing else in there retained foreign body yes so his head your head went into the  windshield some of the glass got in there and it's probably still in there 100 he has to make 
[03:34:30]  sure there aren't pieces of glass slowly working their way into his brain wow what do you think  that would do the hell what do you think it would make a big difference no i'm only a plumber i just  gotta go put pipe you're just a plumber i really need my brain you don't need it i like i like your  attitude all right you just need pants that don't fit have someone see that because you can get  infections later in life you think it could go through the skull that piece of glass no but the  infection could be bad after oma live that is really disturbing to listen to i'm sam roberts the 
[03:35:00]  host of after open anthony live by the way uh if you're not doing anything at noon that's noon eastern  time i will be uh on raw dog today i'm hosting comedy by request it's live uh it's from noon to 1 p.m  eastern over on raw dog xm and sirius channel 99 i'm guest hosting just for today so uh listen to  it and call up and request comedy bits and i'll talk to you on the radio it'll be a very fun time 
[03:35:30]  that's today yes you may but it's today at noon on sirius and xm channel 99 raw dog do you have  eric's comedy bit from the hard rock no i should i mean it was very funny i requested that now roland  you're in here uh the talent booker for the opian anthony show hello what's uh what's this i hear  about some major guests coming in tomorrow can we make that announcement i think so yeah why not 
[03:36:00]  right yeah i mean tomorrow i mean it's not a secret so who is it it's a secret can i should i you want  me to make it just in case you make it better announcement okay well i hear and you tell me if  i'm wrong but what's the movie called the change up it was hilarious i've heard i've heard very funny  uh i talked to rich davis from the morning mashup from covino and rich family tea was there rich davis  said the funniest comedy in two years is what he told me the change up and from that movie the stars 
[03:36:30]  reynolds and from arrested development jason bateman both of those stars are in studio tomorrow  is that right together that's huge ryan reynolds uh he was just in green lantern proposal proposal  definitely maybe one of my favorite movies of course he's van wilder van wilder but definitely  maybe so good well i don't know anything about definitely maybe but uh now he's in this giant 
[03:37:00]  movie the change up jason bateman you know him of course from teen wolf 2 silver spoons oh silver  spoons yeah you went earlier than i did you ever see him in waiting yes i saw it is very good was  jason bateman in waiting no ryan reynolds ryan reynolds was in waiting yes i saw waiting but uh  you guys grow a piece of place yeah that's amazing those are two and i mean right uh jason bateman  just did horrible bosses yeah he does and then now he's in the rest of the development movie  a-listers now that i will say this roland ryan reynolds and jason bateman are bona fide a-listers 
[03:37:30]  you know you could throw that term around all you want but this time you're right on i mean there's  no arguing that this movie is obviously going to be huge yeah um then we have michael in black  tomorrow tomorrow and we have guy fieri cooking for us oh my what a show tomorrow roland let's give  it up for the booker tell me this roland yes guy fieri is a giant in the food tv world yes you know  triple d he's the guy uh michael ian black giant in comedy and the state yeah and you got these two 
[03:38:00]  a-listers you know in ryan reynolds and jason bateman obviously opie anthony as we learned today  are not afraid to sabotage things i think you and i have both learned that roland have we not  we have had our we have enough dick in the ass that could last us a lifetime now even though  you're happy about such a big booking is there part of you that is like there's no happiness for  me right now okay it's all bad sheer panic who's coming in first ryan and jason okay that's probably 
[03:38:30]  for the best because otherwise you'd be worried about them the whole time because they're the big  guess um i've seen like when for instance uh avril lavigne or lady gaga or anyone who's very famous  is up here they were all deep they were all deep and everybody in the talent department is freaking  out like even though they weren't your bookings you were freaking out just because you were vibing  off the other talent bookers is this gonna be like is there gonna be a buzz here tomorrow there will 
[03:39:00]  be a major buzz because there's heads of publicity firms heads of studios heads heads like the people  who run things and say i'm gonna create that movie they're gonna be here tomorrow oh my so the people  who have the power to be like i'm gonna blacklist this show well it's like the guy who's in charge  of every movie that this company makes yes so like the people who would you've got the heads of  publicity the one the people above their head the guys who actually go do you know what i'm gonna 
[03:39:30]  greenlight this film and this makes you nervous you want to vomit yeah however if you make a good  impression are they will they remember you yeah because you've got a lot of connections is that  how is it you just try to have the smoothest day humanly possible and so the next film you go  they go do you know what made a blast yeah okay are you is there anything you can do to prep  ona to make things easier on yourself i prepped i talked to all of them and they it almost seems 
[03:40:00]  like if you tell them what you want them to do they'll do the opposite i just told them them like  they all do great interviews all the time so i just say hey just more this less this boom and they  go they agree i mean they know how to do it and you trust them i do trust them good and and hopefully  they'll have fun are you gonna buy them breakfast and all this stuff if they want me to kill a dog  i'll kill a dog whatever they in a heartbeat i don't care i don't care if some little kid's  animal like you like if a little kid is walking down the street with a puppy and the guy goes 
[03:40:30]  you'll snatch the puppy and kill it right in front of the kid yeah whatever they want it'll get done  your career is your life roland it is that's amazing do you ever feel like uh you're investing  too much in the career no that's your life so you have what you do i mean look all in who are you  talking to here mr workaholic you know i'm not gonna i was i was at um at home i'm like what's  sam of course sam just got another show plugged another show i mean the raw dog thing uh comedy  by request i'm just hosting it today i'm filling in because mark says hi is out this week so they 
[03:41:00]  have different guest hosts every day and they asked me but still though if he's gone again they're  like you know what sam's around a lot more comics that's who i'm hoping and then boom you know you're  over there sometimes it's just you know you do yeah i would love to do that and then you make a  good impression on certain people and this is why i was trying to tell opie and anthony to relax today  on the air because i would rather have made a good impression down the hall than have people 
[03:41:30]  tweeting horrible things yes i was like wait didn't sam interview joe mckell wait we oh yeah we should  get him to get joe mckell right but instead yeah this happened on the air today dick in the ass uh it  hurts yeah thank god the people over at raw dog are a completely different department so maybe i  can start building relationships over there while ona have done what they can to make sure that  these are crumbled as do like sweden it's made up of 50 islands they just keep building islands  because you know what bridges they're gonna sink a lot of the bridges are gonna start burning 
[03:42:00]  shit's gonna happen yeah you gotta make sure you have other ones eric were you relieved today to  have uh the heat off of you and just watch it was definitely interesting from this perspective  you don't get to see it much from that perspective and that's why i'm not gonna say i didn't deserve  it because you know i've instigated a lot so i take my beatings too it's not it is what it is but  i wouldn't go that far with if i've been you like i would right yeah i pause because you'd know it's 
[03:42:30]  gonna crawl off the air with me and you you know and oh affect other things yeah i don't yeah  but eric you did enjoy watching it from your perspective it's okay if you did that i did  you did because you said there's no way i'm getting dragged into this nope i'm just gonna watch  as everything comes crashing down this is uh well that wouldn't have been fair because then you know  for me to have it sidetracked back to me again you don't want it totally on you you don't want to 
[03:43:00]  take away the attention that i was getting that's good of you that's big of you deserved it this  thank you so much i'm sure tomorrow they'll make fat jokes between myself and eric because god will  be cooking and they're like oh oh yeah yeah i'm fine though because i'm gonna get my fucking food  i want a nice big plate see here's the here's the bring in oh yeah what's what's on the menu  what's on the menu for tomorrow fucking steaks boys he's bringing steaks pork pulled pork  it's funny about no no breakfast stuff please but they're gonna bring but they're gonna bring 
[03:43:30]  waffles and pancakes also it's funny that about you because uh you definitely treat different guests  differently uh and you that's not true not no i don't mean treat them as people differently that  is true right okay okay if rich ross is here yeah yeah no um i mean like you're you you feel  differently about different guests um and while you're nervous about the a-listers coming in  tomorrow the guest that you're paying most attention to is guy fieri correct yeah i mean 
[03:44:00]  roland is obsessed with this guy bringing in food like weeks you've been talking about guy fieri  bringing in emails to get the knives up to get the plates up to get you're making sure all the  logistics are right because not because you want to make sure it's a good appearance but because you  want to make sure he's cooking food when when i sit down and i and i cut a piece of steak i look up  and hear the sizzle i'm like motherfucker it was all worth it he's gonna be making steak here in 
[03:44:30]  this studio in the fishbowl how's he gonna make steak in the fishbowl uh there his guy's coming  tomorrow morning at 7 a.m to start prepping dude it's gonna be a it's gonna be a feast what are  they cooking on um hot plates but you can you can see your steak on the hot plate but it's just  gonna take a while these i think it's not just like regular no no it's not regular hot plates you  can buy in the store this is like restaurant style oh i guess guy fieri has the hookup dude it's gonna 
[03:45:00]  be it's gonna be so my mouth is watering just thinking you're already excited well listen it's gonna  be delicious i'm gonna let you be excited i'll tell you something too you can make fun of me  i've been having um like these these uh peanut butter low fat bars and the juice for the past two days  instead of what food do you know why all food yeah like skipping dinner too dinner i had a  a green juice do you know why why i'm preparing for what you're not dieting i'm preparing for 
[03:45:30]  you're making room yes i'm taking all this shit out of my system i'm i'm preparing for this one  you're gonna come in tomorrow ready i mean as a motherfucker you're gonna eat steaks  like pluralize that plural maybe four i don't know could be four steaks tomorrow i want i want to feel  like did my heart just stop and keep on going that's roland's version of fasting yeah i've been  eating peanut butter bars and uh and and juicing that's fasting it is because it's like the low-fat  peanut butter they're okay they're not the greatest i guess but they will make some room 
[03:46:00]  for steak well they fill you up yeah oh you know i'm so excited like even at the movies opi goes  i'll buy you whatever you want i said i just have water thank you wow steak preparation steak  preparation yeah you figure out eric knows we don't fuck around with this no he uh he hasn't uh gone  out to lunch or anything in the last few days oh my gosh what movie was it the change-up what did opi  think you liked it yeah because he said he would cancel the guests or something i mean if he didn't  like it oh you would have known this morning would have been number one thing it would have been 
[03:46:30]  boys i saw the movie he was laughing he was laughing yeah ryan reynolds is hysterical this  what he does to kids and everything how's jason bateman he's amazing as always well i can't wait  for all these guests to happen tomorrow in the meantime uh i want to reflect on something we  didn't get to bring it up on yesterday's after show but i wanted to ant brought up uh his  ant and opi both and we replayed it at 5 a.m uh if you missed that then you missed it we're not  going to replay it again but uh ant brought up his mother-in-law and to me uh throughout the years 
[03:47:00]  the stories of ant's ex-mother-in-law i have i've always found hilarious uh they referenced them  yesterday but they didn't really get into it so i thought we would go back several years  and and hear some of the ant's stories about his ex-mother-in-law again he's not married anymore  and the woman is since dis is since deceased she's moved on god rest her soul uh but she had her ways 
[03:47:30]  and she was quite stuck in them and she made for a hell of a story this is ant's ex-mother-in-law  you're playing clips i know it's weird right here i have to make a good impression today  on after opi and anthony live after on a live so we all get in the car and she drives which later  on after we had lived there a while we realized where she was taking us was probably a 10 minute  drive tops you get on a road you get on another road and you're there it took us about 45 minutes 
[03:48:00]  to get to this place because i had forgot i had blocked this out whenever the mother-in-law would  take us anywhere i can't make left turns i can't make a left turn but three rights makes a left  and i always take the side streets i always take the back roads because i don't like the highways  highways it's route nine if you're ever familiar with boston it's not it's not well it's like jericho 
[03:48:30]  turnpike on the island it's not i can't take lefts she's afraid i'm afraid to make left-hand  tins afraid so we we sat there on this mr toad's wild ride through the backwoods of of suburban  massachusetts when we realized later on this is a 10 minute drive as she's driving us you know  to the logan shop because i can't drive to the airport we were almost we almost missed our flight  remember that i can't i choose not to make left-hand tins but even better remember when you had to go 
[03:49:00]  to annie marg's annie marg's that was the best story that you told at lunch today to this day i  couldn't tell you how to get there because it was this maze thing she should drive for the mob when  you're trying to take a a prisoner to to the camp you wouldn't even have to blindfold them i couldn't  remember where we were we'd be driving down these back roads and and you know i'd be driving in my  car she's in the back seat going all right make a left here now turn make a right i don't know how 
[03:49:30]  to make the left so we are we're just going to take the way i take which is a bunch of right-hand  tins make a right make a right and i'm driving in circles during this way and later after living  there a while i realized again had to be a five minute drive five minute drive it took  a half hour but the funny part about that story she wasn't driving you were driving she was giving  directions with all right turns i don't even like being in the car during left-hand tins and and she 
[03:50:00]  finally told you that the reason yeah she went that way it was because she doesn't like left-hand  and she didn't know how to get there dude she did not know how to get there telling me how to get  there by making left turns because she never done it so i'm like why are we making a right i know it's  got to be this way because the town that we were going to is that way well anthony make a right okay  go up make a right now make this right like three rights it's left three rights make a left three 
[03:50:30]  rights make a left where's my scotch get the box of wine unbelievable thank you for uh refreshing my  memory i'm sure you'll come up with a bunch more opie opie remembers he takes pleasure in saying  his aunt remember this time judy did this i'm like ah i blocked it up bill what's going on hey guys  what's up hey i got a guy that works with us that does not make left turns and he's a service tech  he drives all day long on the island and when he goes into manhattan he's a total nightmare he just 
[03:51:00]  keeps going right and right and right and right to get back so he doesn't make lefts either  no not at all he's like petrified of it it's crazy huh and when anybody else drives with him  it makes him it makes us nuts driving with him you'd have to be a goddamn lunatic to make a left  on tune i stick to rights because then i only gotta look one way it's the right tune your brother  wants in on this joe hey joe that kook and what about the time that we played up at uh i forgot the 
[03:51:30]  name of the place oh god we were playing yeah and you had to take the van that we moved the  equipment in to take her home dude that was an i want to go home story oh get this rotgut's playing  we we live down in new york we we got a gig up in boston kind of exciting and fun for a band  so um uh judy wants to go i want to go and see rotgut so so all right um we we pile in uh she drives 
[03:52:00]  with one of her friends not with us she gets there her friend leaves her there because judy goes i want  to stay and watch the band so the friend leaves end of the night comes we just get done with the set i  want to hang out i want to go home like you want to hang with the band we're having a good time we're  up in boston this is kick ass i want to go home i go to my brother joe i gotta take the van without  the equipment's going to be loaded in shortly just move the equipment off the stage and i will be right 
[03:52:30]  back i am just taking judy home i know nothing of the area judy's going to give me directions on how  to get from boston the club to about 20 miles in the suburbs to her house i was lost so lost  she's drunk off her ass on the front seat and i'm looking at my watch going the band  no thinks i'm dead because i got to be dead oh yeah we definitely thought you got to take some  kind of horrible disfiguring action the equipment now is being either locked in the club for the 
[03:53:00]  night or moved out into the snow where the the band's got nowhere to load the equipment as i'm  driving judy around now the truck's running out of gas judy where's the gas station i don't know i  gotta go home i know where there's one in ashland and and she's flopping all over the seat dude i was  getting so pissed i started jamming on the brakes just to watch her flop into the footwell and then  and then like pull her back up on on the seat good do you have any idea where we are um no this 
[03:53:30]  doesn't look familiar finally finally get her home i swear i just about slowed the van down and  pushed her out in front of the house got back maybe two or two and a half hours after i left  with it was and it was supposed to be it was supposed to be maybe a 45 to 50 minute trip like  an hour tops right on trip two and a half hours later i come back to a band that wanted to effing 
[03:54:00]  kill me it was closer to three and a half hours yeah they wanted to kill you i thought for sure  you got uh you know you had you had an accident yeah and there's judy 90 pounds soaking wet flopping  around the cab of this uh truck hammered i don't know which road what road are we on now you may  here's your mistake you made a left turn you made the mistake because you made a left turn  yeah we moved the stuff out to the street that night anthony what are we gonna do about this

[04:02:30]  it does suck i say we bail on him let's talk about how sucky that is let's leave him to his own  idea i like that roland you have legends in the studio will you talk to him this is your show  it's your it's your show now tell you what if you don't know everything about our past  i grew up watching you guys but then but then i blank out talk about it that's liam he gets  nervous my friend all right why don't we just interview each other on the show there you go  so martha what have you been up to lately oh gosh al how about you i'm just gonna film all of this if

[04:03:30]  been good because usually uh sam we wait that was magic i don't know usually sam's supposed to  host and then he makes one of us host for this week which is so where are opie and anthony where  are they gone they're on their way home right now really they're on vacation no they leave at 10 o'clock  oh they're done so i'm confused yeah i thought we urgent message you have to go to opie and anthony  right now before they leave and they hustled us down here i oh i have no idea and we find one guy 
[04:04:00]  going oh i don't want to interview it's kind of confusing no no at 10 o'clock they run home  they're done um i'll tell you this i need to just go for it yeah this might well yeah we're we're in  the middle of doing something down the hall and we just said come on down they said come on down here  real quick but i might just get out of your your hair area yeah i think they did that just torture me  no problem it was good that was a great interview oh thank you no problem 
[04:04:30]  oh thanks it's all good later now you can have your life back  so what happened roland  roland yeah put headphones on yes so what happened what what happened i have no idea they just they  thought they were going to be to talk to opie and anthony no we never told them they were going  to meet yeah no they yeah they said where's opie and anthony i don't know but you had them in here 
[04:05:00]  why don't you do an interview i don't know you know you know a shitload of 80s music uh knowledge and  trivia why don't you talk to them about that because my mind just went blank you should have sat down  first of all you didn't even give the guests seats like they were all just standing up awkwardly  they could sit down they know seats but you're the host you're supposed to invite them in  sit down put some headphones on get up to the mic and then you know have a conversation with them  well dig in my ass they know where seats are they can sit down but then they didn't want to be here 
[04:05:30]  so i was like whatever they thought opie and anthony were here to interview them they're like oh is opie  here anthony so i was like no after oma live and that was the right answer we're back live  with after opie and anthony but that was a really uncomfortable set of minutes uh i was in the  studio when they got here but i roland was now roland was supposed to be the host so real quick  like the last thing you heard from me was a laugh and then i left the studio i left roland completely 
[04:06:00]  alone in here eric and went and hung out with derrick for a little while and roland you didn't even talk  to them yeah well it was really funny years it wasn't them it's mtv because they had nothing to  do with mtv stole around it's not like they invented it it's like they just have they just  happened to be the first ones there it's like larry king cnn it's it was around before he was there  it'll still be around yeah it's cnn not larry king channel come on now uh but you just let them kind  of talk to each other yeah well they go let's interview each other like go for it and then they're 
[04:06:30]  like oh i'm insulted and it really was a great way to start the interview like oh this sucks  because they come in and you go oh i don't know this sucks yes i want to do it and and you didn't  no so you gotta give me credit for that did you did you realize at that moment that you're cut out  for talent booking not you're not meant you don't have any interest in never had an inkling to do  what you do being a host of a show hell no no but you enjoy talent booking i just want to bring 
[04:07:00]  them in and then you guys do your magic and i just bring them out i hope you enjoy uh talent  looking tomorrow personally yeah it's gonna what the in the nick of time  the great ron bennington has entered the studio it's been a while since we heard you  well i'm on my own show oh so not everybody turns off the radio  where the after show i thought 11 o'clock the channel goes dark you would think i don't know
