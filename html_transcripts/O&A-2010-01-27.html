<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a post-Ozzy Osbourne interview recap, featuring Jimmy Florentine, who praised his own performance and noted his tendency to be more formal when interviewing high-profile guests.  The conversation quickly devolved into a discussion of a listener's ludicrous question about oral sex with Jay Leno and Ozzy, seguing into observations about Ozzy’s sobriety and improved appearance.  Other topics included a video of the Ozzy interview (highlighting a strategically placed rose), a hockey player hit in the face with a puck, a Sassoon jeans commercial, HDTV's impact on sports, Opie retrieving his old car, baseball spring training, the Apple tablet announcement, Newsday.com's financial troubles, and the hosts' personal investment woes.  The segment was liberally peppered with vulgar language and sexually explicit humor.

A caller, Joel from Jersey, claimed Apple would destroy satellite radio by March through a partnership with Pioneer, integrating internet radio into cars via iPhones.  This sparked a debate about the feasibility of such a plan, with callers, including Brett from the Poconos (a SiriusXM employee), ultimately dismissing Joel’s theory.  The discussion then shifted to the future of internet radio and the limitations of widespread reliable Wi-Fi. Commercial breaks for Steven Singer Jewelers and ProFlowers.com followed.

The show then covered the case of a Jets fan tased by police in Indianapolis. Rob from Jersey, claiming friendship with the fan, provided his account, suggesting police overreaction.  Further caller input provided diverse perspectives on the incident and the use of tasers.  This transitioned into a discussion about Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul II’s sainthood, fueled by a news story about the Pope's self-flagellation.  The hosts and callers debated the absurdity of sainthood criteria and expressed skepticism about attributed miracles, with various opinions on miracles and organized religion shared. Russell Peters was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

A discussion about defining modern miracles followed, escalating into absurd and sexually explicit hypothetical scenarios.  The conversation shifted to real-life events like Sully Sullenberger's landing and Pope John Paul II’s life, debated as potential miracles. Callers offered increasingly outrageous miracle suggestions, including Steve-C's claim of walking on a lake of semen. A significant portion focused on a dispute between Opie and Bobby Kelly regarding Bobby’s short film, involving its casting (excluding Jimmy Norton), conflicts with director Joe DeRosa, and crew disagreements.  Listeners were encouraged to tweet their opinions to @joederosacomedy.

An in-studio interview with Pat, the tased Jets fan, his father, and his lawyer followed.  They described the incident, supported by video footage, discussed potential lawsuits, and debated the officer's actions.  Callers offered varied opinions, some angry at the police, others criticizing the lawyer’s assessment.  The incident and the short film remained discussion points.  Guests in studio included Bobby Kelly, Pat, his father, and his lawyer.  Russell Peters’ impending arrival was mentioned.

A discussion about Pat's lawsuit continued, featuring his lawyer, Ron ("Taint Lover"), on the phone with the hosts and Pat's father, Tom.  Numerous callers, using highly offensive language, offered sharply divided opinions on Ron, the police officer, and even the hosts. The conversation revolved around the arrest (involving beer-throwing and resisting arrest, captured on video), the legal case, and Ron's aggressive legal style.  The discussion frequently veered off-topic with insults, jokes, and personal anecdotes.  Russell Peters was present but didn't participate significantly in this lawyer discussion.  The segment concluded with the hosts and Russell discussing Peters's career, travels, encounters with the King of Jordan, and the ongoing short film dispute, which also involved Bill Burr by phone and an ongoing discussion about the exclusion of Jim Norton.

Finally, with Russell Peters in studio, a caller, Sean from New Hampshire, shared a bizarre story about meeting and spending time with a Middle Eastern King (possibly King Abdullah), involving firearms, alcohol, and a prank ending with the King calling him a "biatch."  Various anecdotes about the hosts' and guests' lives and misadventures followed, including mentions of Jim Norton, Bobby Kelly, and an incident involving a mechanic, Larry, and Kenny's truck.  The segment ended with promotion of Russell Peters' shows and mention of other projects by the hosts, maintaining the show's informal, vulgar, and adult humor tone throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw. 
[00:00:30]  Destroy it.  Sexual content is realistic.  And just fucking people reacting with people is realistic.  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  It fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Let's do it.  Hey, look.  We're broadcasting again.  Hey, look.  Jesus.  Yeah, probably.  Not probably.  That's the only thing that sucks about this job.  Is that you have to do it again.  Now do it again.  Do it again.  And you have to do it again right away.  Do it again.  It's the only thing that really sucks about what we do. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  We know that we had a great show yesterday.  It was great.  We just know it.  We know.  Ozzy.  We know when we suck.  We know when we're great.  So you don't really have to tell us either way, to be honest.  Yeah.  But we do like when you say how great we are.  And then you kind of sleep on it.  And now it doesn't matter.  Now we got to do it again.  That was in the past.  How the fuck are we going to top yesterday's Ozzy Osbourne show?  That was in the past.  We now are in the present. 
[00:02:00]  I want to thank everybody who said that our interview wasn't forced.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Because we don't force things.  We just hang and just go with the flow, man.  Yeah.  And Jimmy was just great with Ozzy Osbourne yesterday.  I told Anthony.  Jimmy Florentine, you know, having him in there.  Because Florentine just knows fucking metal, knows rock.  Yeah.  With that voice of Florentine.  Florentine's voice.  He dumps and chews. 
[00:02:30]  It was just, what a great time with Ozzy.  It was phenomenal, man.  It was fun, man.  No secrets here.  So I told Anthony before the show, I go, I think Jimmy has multiple personalities.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we were talking about that.  I'm like, I'm convinced that.  I go, look, we all have issues.  Let's start right there.  I understand that.  I go, but I think Jimmy might have multiple personalities.  Because I'm editing the video that I got on my flip.  And you're just a different guy in front of Ozzy.  Really?  You're just a very different guy. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're not bad.  I mean, you did great.  You were getting your laughs out and stuff, but you're just different in front of Ozzy.  Right when Ozzy comes in.  I told Anthony, I'm like, I don't know this guy.  I was looking on my little HD flip last night when I was editing.  You know what it is?  Because all the entire week, I guess, or whenever you got the book, before Ozzy came in, you're reading through it, laughing, marking the pages with the little post-it notes and everything.  And then when Ozzy came in, you're ready for like a goddamn CNN interview with Ozzy. 
[00:03:30]  And you're just, you do get a little tripped up when Ozzy comes in.  I get very tripped up.  You look almost like Mike Wallace.  You had all your papers in front of you.  All your notes.  These are the important questions I've got to ask.  And then Ozzy sits down and you're like, I'm Mr. Marshall.  Well, I know that's going to happen, so I have to have notes.  I know I have to have notes.  But what's weird is anyone else that comes in, it's not the same person. 
[00:04:00]  Like Jesse Ventura, you're ready to punch him in the face.  It's just, it only happens with Ozzy and Gene Simmons, I think.  I can't think of another guy it happens with.  It's Luca Brasi going to the Don to tell him he hopes his grandchild's a masculine.  May your first book be a best-selling book.  Not that it was bad.  Don't get me wrong.  Don't get me wrong. 
[00:04:30]  It's just, you know.  Yeah, you are like the number one authority on Ozzy information.  Because that's what's good is Jimmy's the guy going like, hey, Ozzy, this back in fucking 75 when you did this and that.  Like, you know this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And it brings that out in them.  But it's like, you are so focused on Ozzy.  It's hysterical.  It's hysterical.  It doesn't help that.  You're a child.  It doesn't help that Jimmy has to sit probably six inches away from him.  Oh, I know. 
[00:05:00]  That's the best.  That's one thing people like about the videos we post.  They go, wow, I didn't realize, like, Jimmy has to sit so close to the gas.  Jimmy will turn to ask a question and he can pretty much tell if the guy has bad breath or not.  Well, Ozzy, every time he would, like, if he would answer me, a lot of times he would kind of, like, lean back in his chair.  Oh, yeah, just to get some focus.  Yeah, and we're talking, we're very close.  Yeah, just to get, yeah, yeah.  I mean, this, I know Sirius XM did the best they can.  But, you know, the studio is just not, you know, it could be way better.  Like, there's not enough room in here for what we do. 
[00:05:30]  I actually liked it yesterday.  I liked the video, too, because from Opie's perspective, you can see Ozzy and then you can see the rose and then you can see me.  Almost as if a rose were placed.  Well, a rose were strategically placed between you and Oz.  Well, that's the next point I'm going to make.  The video up on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, but we're doing, I guess we're doing a product placement officially.  Man, I got beat up, I'm like, and I'm trying to explain to some of these people, I wrote them back, I'm like, look, we're not doing product placement. 
[00:06:00]  We didn't realize that the I hate Steven Singer rose was in the middle of the table here, pretty much blocking out Jimmy's face almost.  So he's going to be happy with that.  You know, the roses that Anthony's talking about, pretty much every five, ten minutes.  Oh, the gold-tipped roses, of course, 24-karat per gold.  Yeah, one just happened to be in front of Jimmy and Ozzy in the video the entire time.  The rose is probably bigger than Jimmy's head because it's closer to the camera. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, the perspective really does make, it looks like Opie's filming us from behind a rose bush.  He's stalking me and Ozzy in a rose bush.  It's hard to film and try to do radio at the same time.  Yeah.  I forgot my tripod yesterday, so I just kind of, eh, whatever.  I think it looks good like that, actually.  Yeah, it looks all right.  It's a pretty cool video.  I titled it Ozzy Osbourne.  It's hilarious.  I decided to just go with all the fucking punchlines and one-liners and funny stories he was telling. 
[00:07:00]  It's a very funny one.  Story after story.  And you've said for years how funny Ozzy is.  Now I'm officially in.  Plus, you know, him being sober for as long as he has been, a lot of people said,  wow, I noticed a major difference with the guy.  Major.  Way more focused.  Can understand him more.  I noticed it at the Sunset Music Festival, just watching him sing.  You can tell when he's on stage it's a different Ozzy.  Completely.  He looked healthier.  It was nice to see how he's happy.  He's in his early 60s and he looked much healthier. 
[00:07:30]  He looked really good, yeah, yesterday.  He had color in his face.  He didn't look, like, saggy.  Like, he was just kind of sitting there and saying he was fucking right on the money, on the ball.  The tremors.  Yeah, yeah.  He talks about them in the book and the tremors have really subsided.  I didn't notice he was shaking as much as he used to.  Not at all.  Almost, like, minimal.  It's kind of creepy.  He looked like he was about 10 years younger than the last time we saw him.  Right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you say?  Yeah, he looked good at XM.  That was 2005.  But I'm sorry, we saw him recently, actually, at K-Rock a couple years ago. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  But yeah, he does look great, man.  I was very happy to see that.  Well, here we go.  Here's the first question of the day.  We got a lot of homosexuals that listen to this show.  George in Alabama.  Good morning, O&A and Little J.  Hey, buddy.  Hi, George.  Can I say something to Steve from Bayshore the other day?  He made that comment.  I'm about wrecked my fucking car.  I was laughing so hard.  He said something about Barry Manilow's going to bite the head off a cock.  Yeah.  Oh, God, that was funny.  Little Jimmy, how are you doing?  I love you.  Thank you, buddy. 
[00:08:30]  Question.  Jay Lano, Ozzy, side by side.  Also, I can live to a trifecta.  Have kids there, too.  But they all whip out their dicks.  Which one are you going to suck first?  Well, that's a good question.  It might be a trick question, Jimmy.  It might be a trick question.  Definitely not Jay.  Don't admit to sucking cock.  That's what he's getting at.  Well, he's speculating.  Definitely not Jay, because he's packing the most.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It would be the most effort.  That's a mouthful.  And it would have to be between Ozzy and who else? 
[00:09:00]  And Kiss.  Wouldn't be Gene.  Wouldn't be Gene.  Paul looked really good when I saw him.  He had his hair short.  He looked very...  Yeah, Paul, honestly, Paul Stanley looked 10 years younger than when we had him in at  K-Rod.  He's got short hair now?  It looks really good, man.  It looks...  No, he cut his hair off short.  Just shorter, yeah.  It just looks right.  A little bob?  Does he have a bob cut?  No, no, no.  A little pixie?  Is it a pixie cut?  No, he's just a short hair cut.  Yeah?  Does he have the Dorothy Hamill?  No, it's a fruit fucking fruit nut. 
[00:09:30]  I'm talking about him.  What, George?  Hey, Opie, I listened to the Messiah's interview with Ozzy.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I have to listen to the replay because I can't stand Ron and Fez from midnight  to four in the morning.  Oh, they do a fine job.  They love it.  Why?  When I re-upped my membership on this thing, I told them I had to get the premium package  or whatever, and I said, just give me Opie and Anthony.  You can take everything else off the radio.  I don't like you, my friend. 
[00:10:00]  An enemy of my friend is an enemy of mine.  Well, sir, I can't stand you.  That's because you're from Alabama.  Alabama, wow!  Let me tell you what.  You don't get the genius that is Ron Bennington.  Shut up.  He hates police officers.  Ron Bennington does.  Well, you know, he's brought up in that thing with the man, man, drug culture, man.  We love Ron.  The cops were hassling him back in the day, man.  Don't you worry about Ronnie.  He's a very law-abiding citizen now. 
[00:10:30]  He is.  The fact that he's a pinko queer is irrelevant.  Exactly.  You know, I went to both interviews, you guys.  Your interview was a million times better.  Yeah, thanks, man.  We didn't solicit feedback, but I certainly got a lot, and people said ours was way the  fuck better because it wasn't for us.  Oh, it was hilarious.  Oh, thanks, man.  We were all just hanging out, letting Ozzy be funny.  That's true.  That's a weird concept, to let your guests talk and let them be funny.  You don't always have to make it about me, me, me, me, me. 
[00:11:00]  What, George?  Jesus.  I said Ozzy was so late.  What are you, lonely?  I was more comfortable interviewing with you folks.  All right, George.  This is the best we could do for you.  Wake up your wife and talk to her.  We got a show to do.  Bye, George.  All right.  Let's go to Fontaine.  Fontaine.  Black listener.  A second one, please.  Oh, that wasn't supposed to happen.  Oh, you're only half and half, Sam. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  I bet you want to do that same joke with the N-word.  Exactly.  Sleeper, please.  Well, okay, sure.  Yes, Fontaine.  What's up, Fontaine?  Hey, Jimmy.  Good luck this weekend, by the way, at the Richmond Funny Bone.  I hope you have a great chat.  Thank you.  I know you will.  Thank you, man.  Hey, you know how you shared some of the kids' dreams from your childhood,  how they would beat you up and throw you down the steps and then love you?  Were there any Ozzy stories from your childhood?  No, because Ozzy wasn't, I wasn't as young when it was Ozzy. 
[00:12:00]  It was a little older.  I was probably like, you know, I was getting into like 13 years old, 12.  It was like around there.  It wasn't, with kids, it was like six years old.  And for kids, they were my longest running idols.  But I would have to say it was, no, it was more just I just loved Ozzy and Black Sabbath.  I know.  Kiss was six, just throwing them down the stairs by Kiss.  But I would cry hard and then they would just love me.  It was so stupid.  That is so bizarre.  Lame.  I know it is. 
[00:12:30]  And then I walk out and I see Paul.  He goes, hey, the funniest guy I know.  I was so happy.  But I had nothing to say.  It would be so great if they just pushed you downstairs.  I actually did walk with him for a minute until I was more comfortable with him just chit-chatting.  That's good.  He's very friendly.  Hey, I know we don't have a lot of people that watch hockey.  I understand that.  The Islanders played the Capitals last night.  Capitals have a fucking strong damn team.  And they destroyed the Islanders last night, 7-2.  The only reason I'm really bringing it up, though, you've got to see the video of Hillen. 
[00:13:00]  I showed Anthony, and Anthony's not even a big hockey fan.  Good one.  He went, holy shit.  Well, who wouldn't love looking at video of somebody getting a puck to the face?  A fucking, what was that, a nice slap shot?  It was a slap shot.  A fucking puck flying into a man's face.  Hillen couldn't have been more than 15 feet away.  He hit the ice.  And he caught the puck.  It looks like right on the front teeth.  Yeah, right on the teeth.  And then blood just coming down the ice. 
[00:13:30]  Just pouring out of his mouth.  It's fantastic.  I don't even have an update yet.  They took him off on a stretcher, and they brought him to the hospital for further observations.  Yeah, that is great.  I want to know what the injury is, if anyone out there knows.  It's called puck to the mouth.  And you know what?  The video, you could see it, but the guy is in the way a little bit, so you don't see.  Yeah, actual contact.  I mean, it's bad, though.  You just see the blood just pouring onto the ice.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  You might want to check that out.  I think the video is posted on YouTube or whatever.  I make the old highlight reels.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's weird with the hockey guys.  They all want to be like the tough guy and not wear the full mask.  Most of the guys are now wearing it where they protect their eyes, so it's like they have a shield just covering their eyes.  I lost interest after Ron Duguay didn't wear the helmet and his flowing locks were going and didn't even care. 
[00:14:30]  That's what I was all about.  Ron Duguay.  Ron Duguay.  There was a weird time in hockey where...  Well, the new guys had to wear the helmets, but if you were grandfathered in, if you're an older dude, you didn't have to.  So you had some of these older dudes like, oh, I'm not wearing a helmet.  And they would take headshots.  It would just get ugly.  It was all the guys that were on the...  In that Sassoon commercial.  All the Rangers.  Remember that?  Like years ago.  There was a bunch of Rangers skating around in Sassoon jeans. 
[00:15:00]  It was like, God, who the fuck was on the Rangers back when Ron Duguay was?  Was it Epstein?  It might have been Esposito.  Esposito.  Sorry, Epstein.  Esposito is a bit old to be in Sassoon jeans.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone should be in Sassoon jeans.  No.  Even if it was way back then.  I'm not pro on looking at men's asses in Sassoon jeans, but I knew he looked horrible in Sassoon jeans.  Did you save up your money as a kid to get Sassoon jeans?  Never. 
[00:15:30]  There it is.  There's the commercial.  Danny found it.  It was Esposito.  Oh, look at Ron Duguay.  This is the worst.  They're wiggling.  They are dancing.  They're wiggling and moving backwards on skates.  This is so bad.  It's like the Bee Gees skating.  Only a few people will care.  Who are the four guys in this commercial?  I see Ron Duguay.  I see Esposito.  Who the fuck is that?  Dave Maloney.  Ron Duguay.  Who?  Dave Maloney.  Dave Maloney is in there? 
[00:16:00]  And Anders Hedberg.  Anders Hedberg?  Those are names I forgot a long time ago.  Fucking A.  Duguay still does a little fucking hockey commentating.  Does he?  And he still kind of has the hair.  Does he have the hair?  Because he's known for the hair.  We talked about that.  Known for the hair.  He needs the hair.  Keep the hair.  When these athletes have that look, they feel like after they retire, they've got to keep  that look up.  They've got to keep...  Does McMahon still wear a fucking headband from Chicago?  Sure.  I'm sure Raleigh Fingers has that stupid handlebar mustache.  I haven't seen a picture of him in years, but I guarantee he has an old, and I mean 
[00:16:30]  old, handlebar mustache.  Mustache.  Mustache.  Let's say hi to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Tony?  I just want to say, high-def TV is the best thing to happen to hockey since I don't know  what.  Sliced bread!  It's so great on TV.  You know what, I've got to agree with you.  As far as all sporting events go, hockey really, really looks great on high-def, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I mean, because it's tough to see the puck to begin with, so the high-def really, really  helps that out.  That's true.  All right.  That's true.  I mean, all sports is kind of cool to see in high-def, obviously.  I mean, you want to see football and basketball, baseball, whatever.  Do you really need high-def for baseball?  I think baseball looks fucking great in high-def, man.  Actually, you probably do, because, yeah, the ball's so small.  When they zoom in on the pitcher's fucking grip on the ball, and you're seeing laces and  fucking dirt under his fingernails, it's like, wow, they figured this shit out. 
[00:17:30]  I had to go out to Long Island yesterday to get my old car that's been sitting in my sister's  driveway for a year.  What are you, a fucking...  Remember the old car that fucking broke down many times?  Is that Raleigh Fingers?  You're right.  I was right.  He still has the fucking mustache.  His mustache.  That's a mustache.  Oh, my God.  And he colored it in with Sharpie pen.  Yeah, it's really dark.  It's like black.  He's completely gray now, but his mustache is dark. 
[00:18:00]  Does he smell like mustache?  Do they always smell that mustache wax that have a scent to it when they have to roll it  up?  I would assume.  Yeah, probably get used to it.  Probably smells like that hippie shit that, uh, what the fuck is it?  Patchouli?  Patchouli?  Yeah, he probably has that.  Or, um, fucking Jennifer Aniston's twat.  We want to bring that back up.  So I got my old car because I gave it to my brother-in-law.  He needs a car.  And it's just been sitting in my sister's driveway.  I brought Kenny out there.  Uh, and we had to, like, jump start it in.  And we had to wipe all the pine cones off it. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, what year is this?  And I drove that back to, uh, the city.  But you went out and got it for your brother?  For my brother-in-law who came out from Philly.  So we did a little...  And what year is it?  A model?  It's 2001.  It's a 2001.  It has 104,000 miles.  Don't say it like it.  It's 2001.  It's still in the decade.  I had...  I just bought my new car is now officially a year old.  And the car I had that before that one was my 2001.  That was your Jeep? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  The Jeep that, uh, I got when we signed the big, uh, the big, the big contract.  Wow.  That's the 2001?  Wow.  Huh.  All right.  It drove nice.  That looks old.  It drove nice with no registration, no inspection, no insurance, no plates.  Oh, you shen me?  You did that?  Wow.  Some of those things I didn't have.  Let's just put it down.  Some of those things.  Good.  Some of those things.  Keep some plausible deniability there.  Man, I found, uh, the back way back into Manhattan.  I'll tell you that much.  Is there a back way? 
[00:19:30]  There is a back way.  Now I know, now I know how the terrorists get into New York City.  No, no police.  Hell no.  Skipping tolls and the police.  Damn, man.  Because this car looks so, this car was just begging to be pulled over.  Filthy.  Oh my God.  It looks like it was stolen from some lot.  Just begging to be pulled over.  Yeah.  But what was my point?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, fuck.  I was listening to the news.  There was a point to this fucking story. 
[00:20:00]  Damn it.  I hate when you lose your point.  It's just a basic one.  I'm listening to 1010 wins and, uh, fucking, fucking baseball.  They're fucking, they're starting that up.  Kind of.  Uh, yeah.  What was that fucking?  What was it?  A mini fucking camp or something?  I'm like, yeah.  And then I quickly looked down.  I'm like, it's January 26th.  Meaning, you know, it was yesterday.  I'm like, the Superbowl hasn't been played yet, but it was some kind of mini camp.  And I mean, spring training doesn't officially start to, until I think, uh, the third week,  something like that in February. 
[00:20:30]  But we're, we're here.  Yeah.  Baseball is kind of starting to rock and roll again.  Creep up.  Did it just end?  They want to make, they want to make their money.  That's what it is.  I mean, you just, you only gave up on your Yankees had it like a week ago.  Back to my tactical wear.  What, just start in April?  Well, yeah.  I mean, yeah, the real games in April, sure.  Yeah.  But I mean, they're starting to kind of, yeah, yeah, that's right.  I like the old days when the baseball players had to have a second job, so they didn't really 
[00:21:00]  have a spring training.  Johan Santana left his first bullpen session of 2010 with a smile.  So you had like a bullpen session Tuesday morning, day two at the Mets, 14 player voluntary  mini camp at a tradition field, uh, baseball complex.  So yeah, they're, they're actually doing something.  That's fucked up, man.  Uh, let me say hi to Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie!  Hi, Eddie!  I think it's a pleasure when the Islanders come to St. Louis to play the Blues. 
[00:21:30]  I just want to say a couple of things.  I like it when you talk about the hockey.  It's really underappreciated.  But this commissioner that we got right now, he doesn't know how to sell the game, but he  wants to keep it as savage as possible.  There's about 50,000 hits per season.  And I think he said that only about 10 to 15 percent of them involved the head.  Right.  So they, there's not going to be any type of big rule changes, but I think they should  get rid of the blue line, get rid of offsides, you know, get rid of the instigator rule and  really open it up, you know, make it violent.  We got a new head coach in St. Louis and we're averaging like four or five fights a game. 
[00:22:00]  Tickets are selling like crazy.  That's what people want to see.  If you don't have that in any other sport, the brutality.  Well, we don't have, uh, we don't have any fighters on the Islanders right now for the  most part.  And most teams don't really dress a, uh, enforcer anymore.  Oh God.  I mean, you remember Tony Twist?  He was a bad motherfucker.  Dude, every fight, every team used to have a guy.  He could barely skate.  His whole job is to go out there and, and fucking, you know, smash some heads.  Yeah.  That was his whole job.  Goon it up.  And there's not many teams that dress an enforcer anymore.  The Islanders barely fight.  So God bless you.  Cause I, the more fighting, the better for me. 
[00:22:30]  I love when they fucking fight.  And you know, when there is a fight, when I go to the games, the kids are on the, they're,  they're actually standing on the seats.  They're loving it.  Just like the adults are.  Yeah.  I'm telling you that intensity at the end of a baseball game, the seventh, the eighth,  the ninth inning.  It's like that the whole fucking time at a hockey game.  People just don't understand that I'm a baseball junkie, but when season comes around, I fall  in love every time.  I guess I got to go on like the hockey network to really get into hockey talk.  Well, I'll say this much and then we can move on.  Um, my problem with hockey and it's getting more and more frustrating. 
[00:23:00]  You, you, you listening to himself.  Most of the time you watch a hockey game, your team is just trying to control the puck.  Yeah.  It used to be when I first got into hockey, there were a lot more plays that were set  up and a lot more, you know, that type of action.  Now it's all about just trying to get the puck and control it for a couple seconds.  Really?  Cause these guys gotten so good.  They're so fast, so quick that it's just like, take away, take away.  It's in the corner.  They're fighting for the fuck fight.  And there's a, there's not a lot of, you know, set up and playmaking anymore. 
[00:23:30]  I wasn't watching.  I haven't watched a full game recently, but yeah, I kind of remember get into the zone.  Right.  And then you're doing a lot of passing back and forth, waiting for the opening.  Yeah.  Coming up ice.  They're setting up a nice play.  You don't get much of that.  You get that when there's a power play.  Right, right, right.  Or when it's a four on four, if you want to really get technical, when they go OT.  But now is it just slam a fucking shot into the goal?  Dude, they're just choked for the best?  They just fight the entire game just to try to get control of the puck. 
[00:24:00]  I mean, there's, hockey definitely has some issues.  They got to figure it out.  They got to open up the play.  They have to.  I think they just got to go with a bigger rink to give these guys more space to maneuver.  A little more ice.  That's right.  Whatever.  But now we're getting probably too deep into the hockey discussion.  But check out the...  Deeper than Mad Dog ever gets.  Huh?  Deeper than Mad Dog ever gets.  Oh, fuck.  I don't talk about hockey.  We talk about hockey way more than Mad Dog does.  I know.  I don't like this vote.  Way more.  Way more.  Anyway, what else is going on?  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  What else is going on?  What's up with this tablet?  I'm not a big Apple guy yet.  Apple coming out with another amazing device.  God, these guys.  Aren't they something?  Yes.  This appears to be.  Now, there isn't any...  There isn't any...  I have to disclose, by the way.  I do own Apple stock.  Let me disclose that before I...  Yes.  Before I say anything about Apple, I will disclose that I do own Apple stock.  Do I have to disclose that I'm an asshole who should have bought it when it was 80 a share, 
[00:25:00]  but I didn't?  You can disclose that.  I spent my money on serious stock, which actually went up in value a lot.  We've got to get a stock market expert on just to calm Jimmy down.  I know.  Because he loses his mind when these stocks go up and down.  He's like, I should have bought it!  Apple, only Apple.  You're never going to get in at the absolute low.  You're never going to get out at the absolute high.  You've just got to hope to get in lower than you sold.  Only Apple.  That's it.  It's honestly the only one, because to me, that was the ones that Apple's so good.  You know what a good time to buy Apple was?  Just before they announced their earnings yesterday. 
[00:25:30]  You never know.  Sometimes that shit backfires in.  After the bell.  It would have been...  No, with Apple, eh, pretty good.  Yep.  Pretty good.  Especially with...  They had the biggest earnings ever for a quarter.  Christmas was in there, so it was giant.  They have the tablet coming out, which seems to be...  A lot of people are interested in it.  What is the tablet?  Isn't it just kind of a laptop?  Dissolves in water. 
[00:26:00]  It's no good.  Yes.  It's granite.  They can't figure out...  All the tablets are dissolving every time it rains.  It's like, I...  Damn it.  We made a mistake.  You drop them in water like an Alka-Saltzer and drink them.  Quickly send email before your tablet dissolves.  A lot of people are saying it's a big version of an iPod, but it's also mixed in with...  With their computer.  So, you know, you get a virtual keyboard that you can use on the tablet, but that can be 
[00:26:30]  pulled away when you don't need it.  You're looking at a website.  Oh, you slide it down.  You're looking at stuff.  You slide that shit down.  It's all touch, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So it's all touch like the iPhone.  You're sliding things out of the way, and this is all speculation because they haven't  shown it yet.  They're going to...  When are they debuting this?  Today.  Yeah.  This is announced today.  Apple has a big thing.  Today.  Pretend Pacific, so 1 p.m. Eastern.  I love their fucking press conferences.  You sit there and watch those things and just cream over the next product that you want 
[00:27:00]  so badly.  And not only are they going to most likely, at this point, definitely announce some kind  of tablet, but I think we're probably going to get a sneak peek of iPhone OS 4.0 as well.  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to...  What does that mean?  Upgrade.  Makes calls.  Makes calls.  It's the phone part of it.  Hey, dude, I'm a Dell guy.  Hey, no, I'm just a dope when it comes to Apple talk, but my dumb observation, like this tablet, 
[00:27:30]  if they introduced this as the iPhone, people would be like, what the fuck?  It's getting bigger now, and all of a sudden, we're excited about this.  Remember?  Things were giant.  There was a time, there was a two, three-year period there where everyone was all about,  oh, look how tiny my phone is.  Yeah, yeah.  You had to get the smallest phone possible.  Now, as human beings, we just, out of nowhere, gave up on that.  We don't care that they're small anymore, because we want them to do a lot more shit.  Want it a little bigger now.  And now we either have BlackBerrys or the iPhone or something similar, and now we have  no problem getting something bigger than that. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  What is going on?  Initially, computers, obviously very big, bulky, low power, and then they got smaller  and smaller.  Right.  To the point where your phone was your computer.  Like, a lot of times, I don't need to carry a laptop with me, but as long as I have my iPhone,  go on vacation, you can do everything you need to do.  So, we should have probably just kept our original computer, because I guess that's where we're  going back to.  That's where we're going back to.  Now, we're just going to get big and bulky again?  Yeah.  It's going to waste the time all these years.  So, this tablet is, yeah, like a bigger version of the iPhone that I think, I think they're 
[00:28:30]  talking about corporations using it, education, things like that, and a lot of the private  sector using it.  If you look at CNN and see how they use that big screen in there, and they're just sliding  things over off screen, pulling new things up, like, that's what you're going to be able  to do with this.  You watch CNN?  I thought you only watched Fox.  I watch both. 
[00:29:00]  Yes, yes.  I push, I pull up my all-news channel, and I look around.  But this is a huge announcement for Apple, and we'll see what it does.  So, the average Joe will not be getting this right off the bat?  I don't think right off the bat.  A lot of business people.  I think it's like the iPhone thing, which sold hugely well.  It sold great.  How many iPhones in the last quarter?  Nine million?  Just shy of nine million iPhones in the last quarter. 
[00:29:30]  Last quarter.  But when it first came out, they were hoping to break that one million mark at one point,  and they got to it a lot sooner.  But that was kind of a techie thing.  You know, everybody didn't go out and get the iPhone right away.  They had to see their friends that had it and say, holy fuck, I want to get that.  And I think the tablet is kind of doing the same thing.  Dell has a computer where the monitor is a touchscreen.  Wait, what did you say, Aaron?  About what?  I didn't hear you. 
[00:30:00]  I was reading email.  What did you say?  I said that Dell, yes, Dell had...  Wait, what did you say?  Oh, sorry.  I'm still laughing at Dell.  Really?  Dell has a touchscreen.  I'm down thousands and thousands of dollars.  Are you still holding that? 
[00:30:30]  I gave up on my portfolio years ago.  It's just sitting, just rotting in my drawer.  Hang it up next to your Citadel fucking useless stock certificate.  Fucking piece of shit.  You said Dell?  Farmer in the Dell.  God damn it.  That wasn't bad.  Dell's back in?  Dell's decided to compete again?  I don't think they are, to tell you the truth. 
[00:31:00]  They have some kind of a touchscreen.  But this tablet thing with Apple...  And Apple's really kind of making headway now against Windows,  as far as an operating system.  A lot of corporations still using Windows,  because they've had it there forever.  But a lot of new companies are throwing Apples in there now.  They're throwing Macs in.  Mac, they've sold more Mac computers this quarter than they ever have.  I got one.  I got a Mac Pro, finally.  Yeah, a lot of people. 
[00:31:30]  I'm in.  I just don't want the iPhone, but I love the Mac as a laptop.  Dude, you would...  I got one.  But you would love the fucking...  I know if you used it.  I got it on my desk.  You would love it.  I play fucking, um, um, um, what the hell is it called?  Oh, great.  It's a fucking game.  It's a Coleco fucking football game.  No.  I play paper toss.  You play paper...  I actually...  You got a $350 paper toss game.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I have an iPhone, and I actually charge it up so I can play paper toss,  and that is all I use it for. 
[00:32:00]  Once they...  You know what?  Once AT&T loses exclusivity,  because Apple is very unhappy with their shit performance,  they're going to introduce one for Verizon.  So once that happens, I think the iPhone will, uh...  Well, that's it, too, yeah.  Really chill the BlackBerry.  Once they get out of that exclusivity with AT&T,  uh, look out, folks.  It's over, Johnny.  The iPhone...  A lot of...  They say a lot of corporations are, uh,  starting to integrate the iPhone into their business  instead of the BlackBerry, which, uh...  You know, a lot of companies, they're just stuck. 
[00:32:30]  There's too many BlackBerry.  They would just cost too much money to switch over  and train people and all that shit.  But, uh, for the most part, I'm sorry.  I've seen both.  I might be a little biased because I have an iPhone, but...  Can you slow down a second?  Yes.  Uh, businesses...  Yeah, they'll use BlackBerrys exclusively  and they give all their employees or their, like,  you know, the ones that matter.  Yeah, yeah.  A BlackBerry and all that.  Yep.  Now, uh, companies don't do that with iPhones, right?  In general?  Uh...  I don't know of one company that actually hands out iPhones 
[00:33:00]  like they hand out BlackBerrys.  Some do.  Uh, younger companies are doing it.  Okay.  Um, and some companies have people that just,  uh, you know,  I guess you gotta buy your own fucking iPhone  and, uh, use it that way,  but, uh, I think you'll see in the future,  especially with, uh,  if Verizon gets in there,  T-Mobile, things like that,  and not just AT&T.  It's over, Johnny.  Do you know BlackBerry how stupid they are?  In this time that they had,  where AT&T was just really the only thing  making the iPhone look like shit, 
[00:33:30]  and the touch one they come out with  is the Storm?  It was like you guys had a chance,  a window,  to come out with a phenomenal touch screen  that people would have been happy with  their BlackBerrys and kept it,  and they blew it.  It's easier said than done.  I'm with Anthony.  People at fucking Apple are geniuses.  They know how to fucking build the shit,  market it,  and it's not...  You know what the best thing about it is?  Yeah, sometimes shit fucks up,  but it is not a buggy system.  I've been amazed over the years 
[00:34:00]  when you buy a Mac,  you're not stuck with, like,  a system going like,  oh, now I gotta wait for this upgrade  because there's a huge bug problem  because they released it  three months too early.  But I'm a BlackBerry user.  I think what happened with the Storm,  my cell provider,  you know, I go to this one store,  and right off the bat,  he goes, do not buy this.  He knew.  But I think BlackBerry panicked.  They were like,  we gotta get a touchscreen out there pronto  because we're getting killed  with this iPhone thing.  But the fact they made you  push the screen in, 
[00:34:30]  they thought that people would  be so used to using the BlackBerry  with buttons  that they wouldn't be able to adjust?  I never even tried one,  to be honest with you.  I had that phone  for a very brief period of time,  and it sucked.  And you hated it, right?  It fucking sucked.  Because fucking Danny  was a BlackBerry guy.  Yeah.  He moved over about a year,  year and a half ago.  They're nice.  I mean, look,  BlackBerry's really nice  if you like getting, like,  all your messages right away  and being, you know,  completely in touch with everybody  every second of the day.  And it really just got obnoxious.  And then when I switched over  to the iPhone,  it was just like,  wow, I could kind of...  I mean, you could do it  with the iPhone too, 
[00:35:00]  but it was kind of nice  to take a step back from all that.  Sure.  And I was...  Well, you listen to fucking audio  of me talking about  Windows-based computing  years ago.  I was so anti-Mac.  Were you?  It was ridiculous.  Yeah.  There was a time you were?  Yeah.  I don't remember anymore.  And now I have one Windows computer  that I use for, you know,  shit I need Windows for.  That's what I got now.  I got my main computer, Windows,  but I'm Mac-prone my ass off now.  Laptop.  I sit on the couch,  pop open my fucking MacBook, 
[00:35:30]  and that's it.  Who doesn't watch TV  with a fucking laptop  on their laptop?  Isn't that amazing?  Who doesn't do that?  You're watching TV,  but you're just...  And if you're not doing that,  your computer's close by,  so you're on the computer  watching TV.  I mean, I have like a little  laptop stand right by my couch,  and I put stuff on,  and it gets to the point  where I'm not even really  watching TV.  I'm just kind of in and out.  Yeah.  So I just kind of have the TV  on as like background stuff  so I can look up 
[00:36:00]  every once in a while.  Yeah, and that's the difference  between the generations  because we're so used  to being brought up on TV  that we always feel like  we have to kind of have the TV on,  even though we're not,  like Danny said,  paying attention.  I imagine the younger generations,  they're not even dealing with that.  They're just on their fucking computer  without the TV.  Because I'm so behind  on stuff that I do like to watch  because I'll put like,  you know,  like dirty jobs on or something,  and then I realize  by the time it's over,  I'm like,  I don't even know  what the fuck you just did.  What the hell did he do?  What filthy job was he?  I'll do it the next day,  and you know,  I have to restart  the same episode 
[00:36:30]  four or five jobs  before I watch it.  Sam, what do you got, brother?  No, I'm just going to say  before we,  about the tablet,  they're also looking to put  the Kindle out of business with it.  Yeah, I was about to get into that  because I'm a Kindle user.  I'm starting to read again,  and the Kindle makes you want to read.  It's bizarre.  I don't know why  because what's the difference?  It's fucking words.  I just presented differently,  so now I want to read again.  And I do have the Kindle,  and it doesn't do much,  so if this freaking tablet  is also capable 
[00:37:00]  of downloading books,  man, Kindle's in deep trouble.  Yeah, deep trouble.  Yeah, but I mean,  the price point on a tablet  is going to be more  than the price point  on a Kindle,  so I think people  who specifically want  an e-reader  will still get,  you know,  the Kindle.  But I'm already looking  at my Kindle going,  man, I wish this would do more.  Right.  But all it does  is download books.  I like it because it's small,  though.  It's like it's really easy  to carry,  so I just throw it  in my carry-on bag.  I don't mind having it separate.  I don't know if I'd want to get it.  Yeah, but you're not going to  grab your Kindle and a tablet.  Yeah.  Oh, you'll have both  when you travel, do you think? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, because both  are probably very thin.  Are you going to get a tablet?  Depends on what the reviews  are on it,  and I don't know  if I'll get it right away.  I just got it in the laptop.  The reviews are going  to be ridiculous.  I bet it smells good.  How about you open the box  and just go,  new electronic product.  Yeah.  What smells better than that?  Pussy ass tinkle?  A lot of things.  A good fart.  Ozzy's cologne.  Well, Ozzy did smell very nice.  He smells rich.  He smells rich. 
[00:38:00]  Always different, too,  his colognes.  Every time he comes in here,  he's got a different one.  His jingling jewelry.  Yeah.  I like those wings he had.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah, that was fucking cool.  He had a necklace  with like two gold wings  with diamonds all over him  and shit.  He wouldn't give me anything.  I was like...  I know.  I tried for it.  I talked about it right away.  No, I tried for it, Jimmy.  He was going to give it to me  before you walked in.  Yeah.  Like you were in the bathroom  and he came in.  The first thing I said is,  wow, that is a nice necklace.  Wings with the diamonds.  Please, Ozzy, give it to me.  Just give it to me  and make Jimmy fucking shit his pants 
[00:38:30]  when he comes in.  Imagine if I went,  look what Ozzy gave me.  Do you know how annoyed I'd be?  That's all I'd think of.  I'd be like, dude,  hey, necklace,  what are you...  Oh, Anthony.  You would have fucking lost your mind.  Hey, before we move on,  could you tell me  what Dell is at?  I forgot about my Dell stock  until we started talking  about the computer thing.  Now, you bought in at...  40-something and 28.  And then to try to make  some of my losses back, 
[00:39:00]  it went down to 28.  And I'm like,  well, it's got to go back up.  So I bought in at 28.  So you try to average...  What happened?  Oh, it's at 13.68 a share now.  That's what you want to see.  Well, maybe it was up.  That's what you want to see.  What's the year high?  The 52-week range is $7  to about 16 to 17 bucks.  Let's try it.  So I'm still $12 a share down  from its highest in the last year.  It's moving.  And 20... 
[00:39:30]  Let's call it $26 down.  Can you show me...  Got it twice.  ...a five-year chart on Dell?  You don't want to know.  This thing hasn't...  Let's see the five-year chart.  Like I said,  bought in at 28  and somewhere in the 40s.  It hasn't come close to the 20s.  Oh, my goodness.  You can see about  where Opie was sitting pretty at 40.  It hasn't gotten up  to where you need to sell  since July of 2005. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus.  It's almost five-year slump you're in.  Holy shit.  My portfolio sucks.  You know what I could have bought  with that money?  I know.  Between the Citadel stock,  which is officially worth nothing,  we lost over $100,000.  Oh, my God.  I should have played blackjack  with that money.  Yeah, right?  I would have had a better chance  on the blackjack table.  Double your money.  Fuck. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  The Droid.  The tablet.  The tablet will also have the ability  to view newspapers and magazines.  Yeah, we said that.  That's really bad news for Amazon.  Oh, my God.  What did I hear?  And Barnes & Noble,  because Barnes & Noble came out  with their version of the Kindle,  I noticed.  I heard something on Wins today,  and please check this  and see if it's correct,  because it's unbelievable. 
[00:41:00]  fucking Newsday.com.  Newsday.com,  which is the worst fucking thing  that exists.  First of all,  I've lived,  so has Anthony,  we've lived in a bunch of places.  Newsday is the worst newspaper  I've ever read.  Just horrible.  I've always hated Newsday  since I was a kid.  Horrible.  And then I moved to Boston  and Western New York,  all over the fucking place,  and Newsday is the worst,  it's such a boring paper.  But now the problem is,  a lot of times  when you put in a news story 
[00:41:30]  in like Google News,  Newsday stories pop up first.  Okay.  So you click on it,  and Newsday decided  that if you aren't a subscriber  to like Cablevision or something,  you have to pay,  you have to subscribe  to their news site.  So it'll say subscriber based,  blah, blah, blah.  Three months now,  they've been subscriber based.  For three months,  you have to subscribe  to get Newsday  on the Newsday site.  35 people have subscribed 
[00:42:00]  in three months.  Get the fuck out of here.  35 people.  Oh, how great is that?  It's fantastic.  When I heard that,  I'm like, good, good.  No one wants to subscribe  to Newsday.com  when, first of all,  you can just go anywhere else  and get your fucking news.  Well, that's good news  because they've been  trying to figure out,  you know,  because these papers are folding  and how they're going to survive,  and a lot of people are thinking,  well, people,  maybe people will buy their news. 
[00:42:30]  And I'm like, fuck no.  You can't force people  to buy their news.  Yeah.  Because if all these newspapers  go online and do exactly  what you're saying  that Newsday's attempting,  the news will get out  another way.  Yep.  There's no way,  you can't make people  buy news.  Can't make us pay  for the fucking news  when there are so many sites  you could just go to  and get the story.  Like when I see,  I'll go to Google News, right?  Right.  And there's a story  I want to see,  and I'll see the sources,  Newsday, Newsday, Newsday,  whatever.  I'll wait till it's not Newsday, 
[00:43:00]  then I'll click on that  and read the fucking story.  Right.  I know I'm not going to be able  to see it  because it's subscriber-based.  35 people, good.  Good for you,  you dumb, greedy shitheads.  The article I read  is that it costs  $4 million for them  to revamp their website.  So with those 35 people,  they've recouped $9,000 so far.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah, Scott asked  from Quakertown,  it was $5 a week?  $5 a week?  To read the news? 
[00:43:30]  On Newsday.com?  What dummies?  Who's in charge of Newsday?  Hugh Pinero?  Douche.  Take that wherever you are.  What fucking assholes?  Threaten people  to breathe in their face  if you don't fucking  cough up some cash.  Well, that's good news, though.  That's really good news.  Oh, yeah, I know.  I heard that.  I was like, what?  Did they say $3,500?  $3,500?  You can't expect people  to pay for the news.  No fucking way.  $5 a week?  What idiots?  You know, they're in trouble. 
[00:44:00]  They've got to figure it out.  That ain't it.  Well, you know,  the reason newspapers  are in trouble  and regular radio  is in trouble  is that they don't have  creative people  to figure out  what the next stage is.  Cost per subscriber?  $114,000.  Nice.  So they won't break even  until $38,16.  Was I calling it  the tabloid  instead of the tablet?  The tablet, whatever.  It's fucking early.  You could read tabloids  on your tablet, I bet.  Well, here you go. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  I should have said that.  That's a good joke, though.  It's funny.  Shut it.  Tablets.  I didn't know that  about Newsday.  Yeah, that's great.  Well, the pumposity  to think that people  want Newsday.com so bad.  And it's a big tie-in  to cable,  to fucking cable vision.  Parent company, yeah.  Yeah.  So it's, you know,  they try to say,  well, if you got that,  you get that.  Another thing  I'm really pissed off at  is I have 
[00:45:00]  IO, cable vision,  whatever the fuck,  right?  And then I see  the commercial  that says,  oh, this is good.  You can program  your DVR  from your phone  if you're away.  If you want to  tape something,  you're like,  oh, shit, let me do that.  Yeah.  Only if you also have  their fucking  internet service.  I don't.  I have  Verizon  fiber optic  super zoomy  speedy speedy  internet.  And I can't 
[00:45:30]  fucking  program my  DVR from  away because  but I have cable.  I have their cable service.  I have their fucking  DVR.  I have all that shit  but they won't let me  because I don't also  have their fucking  they just don't  greedy cunts, man.  Fuck them.  Let's say hi to Joey.  This cannot be possible.  Joey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Joey.  Listen,  the newsstand price  for Newsday  went from 50 cents  daily to fucking  $2. 
[00:46:00]  That cannot be.  Maybe you bought it.  Did you buy it  in an airport?  Because in an airport  the New York Post  is $2  but here  it's still  regular price.  What is that?  No, I mean  every mom and pop  store.  Hold on a minute.  All right, hold on a minute.  I got a Newsday  right in front of me here.  Lucky devil.  Don't nod off  while you look at it.  No kidding.  Joey is almost right.  It's a dollar.  It says a dollar  right on the front page.  Maybe that's  your subscription price.  What?  Is that a subscription price?  Is that New York Newsday? 
[00:46:30]  City edition.  I have no idea.  But a dollar  for a newspaper  every day?  That's kind of crazy.  That is crazy.  And Joey's saying  it's $2.  I don't buy this  fucking paper.  I really don't.  Can I see the Newsday?  Oh, sorry.  That's all right.  It's a terrible paper.  That sucks.  All right.  Well, newspapers  are in trouble.  They just got to...  I don't know  how they're going  to figure that one out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Greg and DC.  What are the papers we got?  What's some of them  other papers?  You know what, Dad?  People like to hold  their computer.  They like to hold it open.  You got your tablet. 
[00:47:00]  Boom.  You read a little bit, Dad.  You zip, zip, boom.  You listen to some music.  Got your coffee.  Got your cigarettes.  You're fishing.  Got your other obsessions  to take your mind off  with a zero yard.  You know what, Dad?  I'm doing a movie  with Bill Burr  and Joe DeRosa.  Why would we ask  Jim Norton to be in here?  Oh, yeah.  You know what, Dad?  I saw that Twitter.  What the fuck  is he thinking?  All of them.  Why?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Why not put Jim in?  And I want a legitimate answer  from that piece of shit.  You don't call a comedy seller? 
[00:47:30]  Or Jimmy Norton  isn't in that movie.  Not even in a little part.  Or asked.  Even asked to be in it.  Yeah.  So you could say,  fuck you and your piece of shit.  Yeah.  Whole movie.  DeRosa, Bill,  and Bob.  Whoa, Bill.  Whoa, Bill.  What the fuck?  All those ungrateful bastards.  Let's say that to Greg in D.C.  Greg?  Not even right.  We'll have to get Kelly  on the phone to defend himself.  Greg?  Good morning, boys.  Thank you.  I wanted to call in  and ask Opie  if he gets his stock tips 
[00:48:00]  from the same placemats  he gets his news from.  Wise ass.  That's pretty good, though.  Punch it out.  I just fucking suck  at picking stocks.  Yeah.  You know something?  There's...  I actually don't even  pick them myself.  Yeah, that's the problem.  You gotta...  And then, you know what?  You gotta dig right in there  with E-Trade  or whatever fucking  personal trading program  you got  and do it yourself.  Dude, my brother,  and this is what's sad, 
[00:48:30]  you'd think it would rub off.  My brother was a  Wall Street stud.  Yeah.  You know, when the whole market  went really bad,  he lost his gig,  but they want him back bad.  There's a lot of people  trying to get him,  and he's like,  fuck that,  and he's just day trading.  Yeah.  And doing very well.  You would think  some of that knowledge  would have rubbed off.  I pick my stocks.  I go,  BlackRock!  Can I invest in that?  Spike upwardly, please!  Dividend! 
[00:49:00]  Why do they do that?  BlackRock!  Yearnings report, please!  Yeah.  Terrible.  Oh, I don't know  if this is true,  but this affects us.  Well, you've got a mic  in front of you  once you say it.  No, it's a phone call.  Joel in Jersey.  Joel?  How you doing, guys?  Hey!  I've worked with Apple  for a number of years, 
[00:49:30]  and basically,  they have a corporate plan  to destroy  the satellite radio.  It's not that difficult  to explain.  Basically,  you guys have  a virtual monopoly,  and it's the least effective  corporate monopoly  I've ever seen in my life.  There's not much competition,  so Apple is going  to contract  with the technology  for the iPhone  starting in March,  I guess,  with Pioneer,  and they're going to have  a system installed  in new cars,  and they're going to be able  to put the internet radio  in the cars  with the desktop technology. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know  if you know this,  but that's the number one  place to get new listeners for.  But this isn't anything new.  The problem is  getting Wi-Fi  that is all over the place,  like doesn't drop out.  It's like getting music  on your cell phone right now.  You know,  you're going to get  some dropouts.  The thing with satellite is  it's there  the whole time  you're fucking driving.  Once they figure out...  What?  They're going to the planet  to get their own satellites  and piggyback on them. 
[00:50:30]  Do you know how long  it takes to launch  a network of satellites?  We'll be retired by then.  So you're talking by March?  Right.  No, these products  will be available  with a functioning infrastructure  in March of this year.  Well, look,  March of this year  they're going to launch...  Wait a minute.  They're going to launch satellites.  Pioneer is planning to use...  I'm pretty sure  they'll be piggybacking  on a pre-existing satellite.  Piggyback on what satellite?  Yeah, how do you do that?  GPS satellite  all of a sudden  is going to be blasting music?  Honestly, no. 
[00:51:00]  This is all going to be  based on the network  off of the iPhone.  Look, I know, I understand.  But you can't take  a satellite  that isn't proprietary  to, like,  bouncing music off of it,  like our rock and roll,  our satellites,  XM,  and the other one,  I don't know what they call it  here at Sirius,  but you can't then  just take  some old fucking V-ger.  They're not going to take V-ger  and start playing music  on your iPhone.  It's going to take Logan 
[00:51:30]  and March  to launch a satellite.  I agree with you.  That is where the future lies,  believe me.  I love the fact  that when I'm in my Mustang,  I plug my iPhone in  and play everything  I downloaded  right off of my  stereo system.  It's great.  And listen,  I mean,  I just want to say  that there's a reason  that most of the major houses  have downgraded  the Sirius stock  in the last couple of months.  I mean,  we're giving out directives  to all kinds of people.  You know,  they're not planning to buy it  and it's because  this is coming up.  Well, Sirius has had  a nice run lately, 
[00:52:00]  though,  with the stock.  And lately,  there's competition.  I grant you that, sir,  but by March,  there will not be  satellites orbiting  this Earth  that will feed  iPhones  music.  I will guarantee  you that.  I'm not going to  take that bet.  I just...  Plus,  there's only a limited  amount of satellites  that you could have.  Like,  I remember,  it's probably not  100% accurate,  but, you know,  as far as geostationary 
[00:52:30]  satellites go,  there's only so many  that you could have.  There's so many out there.  And, like,  there's no more room.  There's no more room.  For, like,  more satellites.  That's why it's very complicated  if you want to get  a satellite up there.  Well, actually, look,  Eric Logan,  probably five or six...  No, about five years ago,  warned Anthony and I.  He took us to dinner.  He goes, you know,  the big competition  for satellite radio  will be Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi.  And when Wi-Fi...  When Wi-Fi is available  across America,  that, you know,  satellite radio is  going to have some problems.  Exactly.  But then that's when  it comes down to content.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Exactly.  But the thing is,  getting Wi-Fi  that is dependable  with no dropouts.  Now, that's tough.  That's definitely  a bunch of years away.  I don't know how many.  That's very fucking tough.  Well, you guys are missing...  You move around  your house too much  and the fucking thing  peters out on you.  They're going to have  a satellite,  but it's going to be lower.  They're actually going to launch...  It's going to be 150 feet  off the ground,  zipping around.  Now, who the hell  would sell that kind of satellite?  You know how nervous  that would make  a lot of people?  What would happen 
[00:53:30]  is there's a big beeping  sound that comes.  Beep, beep, beep.  And everybody in town  ducks.  You duck?  Where are we going  to get this?  From Ted's fucking  satellite aquarium?  Everybody runs  into bomb shelters.  How many nervous  Nellies you would have?  Oh, my God.  It's going to be  called Pandora, guys.  That's what it's called.  The service.  All right, Joel.  Pandora, like...  We gave you your time.  Thank you.  We understand  satellite radio  has some issues  to figure out  and there's going  to be more  and more competition  as we move on.  What that guy said  is 3,000% wrong. 
[00:54:00]  Of course it is.  Because I was just  reading that story.  It has nothing to do  with...  There's no satellites.  It's just Pioneer  is getting involved  with Pandora.  I mean, yeah,  it has nothing to do  with satellite.  It has nothing to do  with Apple.  Or Apple, right.  Oh, my God.  The guy...  That's why I love  when some people call  and you call them out  on it and they will not...  They will not fucking  give up on the story.  But the only part  of his call  that is true,  the Wi-Fi thing,  is definitely a concern  as it continues to grow.  I'm not sitting here  with my head in the sand  saying,  oh, don't worry about it. 
[00:54:30]  But getting a dependable  Wi-Fi coverage  that covers the entire country  where you can drive  in your car  and get Wi-Fi  is ridiculous.  But don't you think  at that point  Sirius XM  will be way ahead  of the competition.  They're organized  as far as, you know,  the channels go,  the content.  Look at us petting the dog.  And how about  having serious Wi-Fi?  That's what I'm getting at.  Where you're not  just going away.  Well, our satellite users...  Why wouldn't they jump  into the whole Wi-Fi world 
[00:55:00]  when that does become  something that is  big-time competition?  You put out a product  that gets Wi-Fi,  that receives Wi-Fi,  then you have all this content  that they have already  instead of an upstart company  that's now got to get content.  Have you ever tried?  You have content.  It's like they...  We understand.  I...  I'm a student  of this damn radio thing  and internet radio  is appealing to me.  It's complicated, though.  It's...  It really is.  It takes forever  to find a cool  internet radio site.  There are so many  because so many people 
[00:55:30]  have the option  to do it.  So that's why  it's going to be important  then you get somebody  that can organize  the internet radio  and go,  well, we've looked  at all the internet radio stuff  and this is what we think  is the best out there  and then package it that way.  That's what needs  to happen  with the whole  internet radio world.  Exactly.  And that's something  satellite radio  SiriusXM  is already doing.  Yeah.  Why don't we take  our first break?  No.  All right.  All right.  Well,  Eddie and Virginia...  You have satellites  that look like apples 
[00:56:00]  floating around  with worms  coming out of them.  Oh, Chip!  Eddie!  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Anthony, when you go  to your financial advisor  do you say  Prospectus, Rudy?  Yes, that's me.  Prospectus.  I hate the prospectus.  I don't know what that is.  I know.  It's like a fucking...  It's like a one-over  on what the fuck  you're buying.  It gives you kind of  the stats and stuff like that. 
[00:56:30]  The book report  on your company.  Yeah, it's like a little  book report on your company.  You're right.  The prospectus.  I don't read it.  I look at charts.  I look at hot zones.  I look at graphs.  Those things take up  a lot of space  in my mailbox  and just throw them  right away  but maybe I should  start reading them  because I'm not  doing too well.  They're great  for rolling up  in tight little things  and you put them  in your fireplace  and they start logs  very well.  Oh, yeah.  Fire.  Fire starter.  Yes.  Brett calling us  from a heart-shaped tub  in the Poconos. 
[00:57:00]  Brett.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  How's the champagne glass?  Yeah, it's actually  not too far from my house  strangely.  We know.  We know.  You're in the Poconos.  Anyone who lives  in the Poconos  is very close  to a heart-shaped  slash fucking  AIDS tub.  AIDS tub.  Very good.  I'm actually  on my way to work.  I work for SiriusXM  in the satellite  operations group.  Wait, who do you work for?  What was that?  Who do you work for?  I work for SiriusXM.  Boom! 
[00:57:30]  Sorry.  Thanks for humoring me.  It makes me feel  right at home now.  Yeah.  What's up, Brett?  Go ahead.  No, I was just calling in.  I was hearing that guy  going on about Pandora  and the Pioneer Radio  and all that nonsense.  And, you know,  for anyone to think  that someone like Pandora  is going to get in bed  with a satellite company  is just crazy.  Our company,  you know,  it's going to be  at least a decade or so  before Wi-Fi  is really an issue.  Yeah, that's an idea.  It's very difficult 
[00:58:00]  to get it all over the place.  It's definitely creeping up.  Yeah.  It's getting there.  But, I mean,  look at it like this.  I live in the Poconos.  In order for me  to listen to you guys,  I have to have an XM  or a Sirius receiver  in my car.  There's no way  I could use an iPhone  or anything like that.  Never going to happen.  All right.  Sat phone.  Plug a sat phone  into your fucking computer.  All right, Brett.  Thank you, sir.  Listen to us  for $20 a second.  I think the way  the show should be  is there should be  one location  and everybody should have  to drive there  and listen to it  in chairs.  They should have  auditoriums set up  all over the country.  You think that would be 
[00:58:30]  a bad business model?  Oh, you know what?  A bad business model, yes.  If you had these  special receiving stations  set up  with just metal chairs  and coffee and donuts  set up  and people had to get them  by a certain time.  How many listeners  do you think we'd have?  You might have three.  Can we make these  hot spots  in really cold areas too?  Metal chairs.  There's one in  Judo, Alaska.  It's horrible.  That's a bad business model.  All right.  What else?  Well, we've got a lot to do. 
[00:59:00]  Russell Peters is coming in?  Yeah, he's in it like...  What?  He's like one of the  biggest comics in the world.  Yes, he is.  And he was on our show once  but unfortunately  we had so much going on  we didn't really get  to do much with him.  He's doing Radio City Music Hall  I think this week?  It might be this week  he's doing two shows.  I don't know.  I don't have the sheet  in front of me.  All right.  Damn.  We got that going for us  which is nice.  Keith Olbermann's 51 today?  Holy shit. 
[00:59:30]  Any other fun factoids  before we go to break?  We'll figure out more factoids  after the break.  Oh, be it Anthony.  Stay there.  Hey.

[01:00:30]  of the rose  than he has on his website  IHateStevenSinger.com  Oh really?  Yes.  It looks wonderful.  You know what?  I would go with the red rose  now that I see it in this video.

[01:05:30]  I think that was  before the game  Oh so everybody  was just yelling  at each other  in their different jerseys  What a bunch of  fucking assholes  Fucking idiots  Those millionaires  are you thinking  they're yelling about you  Guy with mullet  Fat guy with man tits  You fucking  I don't  I'm not knocking  sports fans  You don't wear your jersey  Just the jersey  on the  Go to show loyalty  Sports fans  Really?  Half the guys  that say that  cheat on their wives  But they're loyal  to their sports team  Exactly  Dopes 
[01:06:00]  Not enough  of sports fans  But I give props  to the guys  that wear the jersey  and you know  like let's say  the Islanders  are playing the Flyers  you know  the guy  wears the Flyers jersey  to the Islanders  home game  Those guys  I give them props  that takes balls  I can't do that  I don't know  You just want to  enjoy the game  and because you got  the jersey on  and you know  it's not your team  and it's not the  home team or whatever  they're pouring beer  on you and stuff  and now you gotta 
[01:06:30]  fight your way  out of the fucking  place  Who needs that?  It's complete  Idiocy  But the people  that do it  God bless them  I can't do it  I can't fucking  wear an Islanders jersey  anywhere else  but the Coliseum  and I barely  wear them there  They buy the  extra large one  because they have  to put it over  their hoodie  so everybody knows  what team they're with  I'm in team Jets  Yeah?  Are you?  Are you?  Just clap when they score  have a fucking hot dog  and shut up  Yeah, nice play  Do that 
[01:07:00]  No one makes me  laugh really hard  Excuse me  I'm a Jets fan  but seeing everybody  still walking around  with their Brett Favre  from Jets jerseys  Oh, I know  Yeah  Oh, I feel bad  for those people  Have fun  That's a good  Huh?  Oh, that's the  Devils fan from  I think that's from  Patton Oswald's movie  Looks like the  Bjork fan  No, that's Dave Putty  from Seinfeld  Oh, yeah  Okay  Now that I'm looking  closer, I'm sorry  Elaine was just  mortified 
[01:07:30]  that he was  dressed like that  Dressed like that  I'm going to go  paint my face  Scares the priest  Yeah  We got  Devils  Rob in Jersey  is claiming that  he's friends with  the guy that got  tased  the Jets fan  down in Indianapolis  Rob, what do you  got on this?  Oh, hey  what's going on  fellas?  Are you really  a friend of this guy?  I swear to it  he's from  Ocean County  and he plays  on a rugby team  in town  in the area  in Jersey  and I was actually 
[01:08:00]  I went to the  tailgate with him  that day  and the cops  were such dicks  they were  Jets and Colts fans  on opposite sides  of the parking lot  and the cops  didn't like where  we were standing  so they started  rolling their patrol  cars through the  middle of the Jets  tailgate  and everybody  was backing up  and I guess  Pat didn't back up  quick enough  and he kind of  shrugged his shoulders  like what the hell  do you want me to do?  and this dickhead cop  the plainclothes guy  gets out and goes  you got something  to fucking say?  and Pat goes  no I was just 
[01:08:30]  I couldn't back up  and that's when  they whipped him up  against the car  and uh  I tell you what  when you're five feet away  that taser sound  is a whole lot scarier  than it is on the video  you'll really stop  running your mouth  when you hear  that shit up close  they were just  looking at  taser jet fan  so did he not  go to the game?  he didn't go to the game  they threw him  in a holding cell  and uh  they told his father  and his brother  he told his father  and his brother  to go to the game  so they went  but he was in jail 
[01:09:00]  they couldn't get  a judge there  on a Sunday  wow that sucks  yeah  for what?  exactly  the only issue was  they said  the cop said  that he  uh  he whipped the taser out  because Pat  was resisting arrest  and uh  nothing like that  went on  and that's why  we were actually  kind of the ones  that blew the story up  once the video went up  we sent it over  to the post  we sent it over  to Fox  uh  we threw it up  on Facebook  we're just gonna  try to keep it going  for a few days  if we can  yeah if you look  at the video 
[01:09:30]  it doesn't really  look like he's  resisting that much  to tell you the truth  he's uh  but he just  they grab him  out of the crowd  throw him onto  the trunk of the car  and that's pretty much it  can I play devil's advocate  though  yeah  devil's advocate  uh  back up  but not fast enough  stand advocate  tased  the cops  I mean we  we uh  we support cops  obviously  everyone knows that 
[01:10:00]  now the cops know  that everyone has  their cell phones out  and they're ready  to tape everything  yeah  so why would they  take that chance  there right  because it's fun  it's fun to tase people  I can't  uh  the the risk  oh it's nothing  compared to the fun  because as soon as  there's some kind of  commotion  we all now  just lift up our phones  and start taping  yep  we don't know what  we're gonna get yet  but we're at least  trying right  yeah  and the cops know  this shit  do you think  they're more naive  in the midwest  than they are  to the fact that  we're gonna be 
[01:10:30]  all over them  as New York  and New Jersey people  I don't know  I'm just throwing  that out there  as part of the  issue here  that's all  I mean I believe  your story  but I'm just wondering  why the cops  would be that dumb  if everyone's  filming  I don't have  an answer to that  yeah  hmm  alright  but  hey what about  what about  your buddy  any chance  of getting him  on the phone  potentially  I know  I have his  brother's phone number  so I could probably  try to get a hold  of them 
[01:11:00]  alright  you wanna sit  on hold  for a sec  yeah we wanna  get your friend  on the show  ok  alright hold on  alright cool  let's go to  Jim in Iowa  Jim  yes hope  morning  good morning  hey this guy  full of shit  Ian Halperin  had this story  yesterday  he called  yesterday  with the same  story  about the taste  look it up  look it up  I was five feet  away  I was five feet  away  I saw the whole  thing  just google it  the video is up 
[01:11:30]  I said  this was gonna  happen  before it happened  you know what  kind of pussy  you can get  in Indianapolis  google it  some of the  finest pussy  in America  he was working  on a project  a project  the cop  obviously  his wife  had a stinky  pussy  and he was  upset  that's the news  that's going  around  google it  google it  it's an exclusive  for you guys  even though I've  talked to everyone  else before you  google it  google it  you can see  it for yourself  damn  every fucking  story he gives us  it's an exclusive  to you guys  no no google it  and then I go 
[01:12:00]  on the internet  it's like  it's on every  major fucking  gossip site  800 billion  reporters call me  and I said  no I'm just  doing this  for Obi-Nan  Google it  google it  fucking love  the guy though  he's such a tool  supposedly the  oh it's Kevin  from Connecticut  I don't know  the cop said  to the jet fan  you spit on my  wrist  wipe it off  wait does Kevin  have knowledge  the Colts fans  were chanting  T-A-Z-E  taste  taste  taste  oh shit 
[01:12:30]  oh shit  were they  I mean that's  a great line  Kevin comes up  with good lines  so is he going  for the joke  or is that  what really  happened  because they  could go  either way  on that one  right  that sounds  pretty fucking  funny though  yeah that's  pretty good  Nancy Grace  is getting sued  because of that  woman that  committed suicide  oh is she  yeah  really  I don't know  what the woman  had done  after the tough  interview by  Nancy Grace  yeah yeah  Nancy Grace  kind of grilled  her in an  interview and  then she killed  herself but  what the fuck  is that  I wonder if  Nancy Grace's  company is going 
[01:13:00]  to cover her  in the lawsuit  or if they're  just going to  leave her hanging  interesting question  yeah  you would think  a company would  probably you know  back her  you'd hope so  good company  would  sure  yeah  yeah  I would think  yeah she's  probably totally  covered any  real company  especially if it's  in her contract  yeah exactly  speaking of football  Obama  what  at least this  guy could make  a make a choice  Anthony  oh can he  he's rooting for  the Saints to  win the Super  Bowl  oh is he  usually his  politicians like  I like both 
[01:13:30]  teams  well if he  if he treats  this like he  treats his  politics by  halftime he'll  switch and say  the Colts and  say he never  meant that he  was going to go  for the Saints  how great would  that be if a  president goes  for the first  half I'm rooting  for the Colts  second half I'll  root for the  Saints  how funny  would it be  if he went  to the game  and he was  wearing very  very tight  shiny like  almost like a  lycra but  shiny gold  uh fucking  saints shorts  and like a  cut off black  shirt with like  a huge bulge 
[01:14:00]  almost like the  fucking cheerleaders  in um  in the longest  yard  and he was  just effemnately  clapping and he  had like pom-poms  in the booth  and there's people  like what are you  doing here  how would the  announcers handle  that  well the  president's here  and oh  really seems to  be a fan  and he came  into the booth  and he was  just talking  oh my god  the first half  has been amazing  oh they just  look so good  in the uniforms  so big  manly  oh thank you 
[01:14:30]  mr president  holy shit  shiny gold  tight  like ball  hugging shorts  hey we got more  on the tasing  thing  we got a cop  i believe we got  a cop  ed in indiana  ed  good morning  boys  morning officer ed  hey man  yeah  about that  taser shit  i've had one of  those for  close to a year  and you go  shooting people  with it  there's just a lot  of fucking  paperwork involved  you gotta take it  to the hospital  yeah but it's  fun  it's fun 
[01:15:00]  it's fun to  tase someone  well it's fun  don't get me wrong  but it's not fun  when they tase you  i don't know  one cop that  doesn't think  tasing someone  is a pisser  i think if we  sat down with  the cops  they would go  man it's worth  all the paperwork  all the  oh please  all the  whatever  once that  motherfucker  jolts and  goes on the  ground  you don't give a  shit how much  paperwork you got  that is your  best day  at work  when you get 
[01:15:30]  to tase  somebody  come on  i feel kind  of sad for  him too  because you  remember what  it feels like  and shit  so  sparingly  we're not going  to worry about  the emotions  of the situation  i like  we just  watched that  one tase clip  where the cop  goes all right  enough we've been  tased we know  what it feels like  and she goes  well i ain't  never been tased  yeah you're sitting  with the hospital  for an hour after  that you'll regret  it  tasing audio  funny every time  i don't care if  it's like an old  lady or  my favorite

[01:18:30]  so the cop  grabs her arm  and goes  now you're  getting out  of this  fucking car  he wasn't  yanking her  to the ground  he was grabbing  her arm  getting her  out  and that  the second  he touched  her  get your  hands off  and then  she just  completely  started  resisting  oh is that  fantastic  i didn't care  for that  what  hysterical  mac in  atlanta  mac  mac  okay  this is  just  an  observation  but you  know why  obama's 
[01:19:00]  rooting for  the saints  right  uh oh  hold on  where's my  dump button  go ahead  you know  what the  majority  is down  there  right  um  hold on  saints fans  yeah  saints fans  that's good  um  much blacker  than indianapolis  you're saying  sir  there you go  oh  oh i didn't  i didn't see  where you were  going there  it's uh  well  according to  uh  mayor nagin  it's a  chocolate city

[01:20:30]  that's a lot  of fun from  what i hear  would you take  the ride  nope  no i  wouldn't take  the ride  no fucking  way man  no  that stupid  pen that  kelly had  in was  enough  yeah it was  enough of a  zap for me  uh what  matt  i go at  nine o'clock  on friday i was  gonna call you  guys afterwards  yeah give us  a call let's  know how it  went  that was good  man  yeah let's go  to dave in  connecticut  dave  hey good  morning boys  hi dave  um there's  been a thing  a couple cases  recently in 
[01:21:00]  massachusetts  where the  cops are  arresting  somebody or  they're at a  party somebody  whips out their  cell phone  records them  and the cop  asks well can  that take  you know record  sound and  they're actually  arresting people  under an old  wiretapping law  saying you can't  record a  conversation  without the  other person  knowing there's  been about three  cases of it  and uh  one was thrown  out one was  upheld and  there's one  pending  well yeah the  cops have  recording uh  audio aren't  they yeah but 
[01:21:30]  in public it's a  whole nother story  maybe in a house  i i don't know  where that would  yeah we need the  circumstances of  the case i guess  because you're  allowed to record  shit out in in  public without  people's specific  knowledge well  they what they're  saying is if  you're out there  with a regular  video camera  it's inherent  that it's  recording sound  yeah but with  all the cell  phones and  everything these  days that can  do it it's not  inherent so  they're using that  loophole to  arrest people that  are recording you  know whether they're 
[01:22:00]  doing something  wrong or not  well it's mass  that sounds about  right for up  there motherfuckers  cops can really do  whatever the fuck  they want up there  to tell you the  truth yeah  pretty much  yeah all right  sir uh we got  someone from the  in the uh pd  department to get  the other side of  that story uh  ron indianapolis  yeah guys are  you uh are you  on the police uh  force no oh  okay sorry i got  bad knowledge sorry  go ahead i'm just  gonna tell you guys 
[01:22:30]  that uh indian police  get all wound up  over everything they  do the same thing  with the black expo  and the 500 and  the stock cars when  they come into town  oh yeah  attitude  you got a bit of  an attitude like  busting a little  ass when uh the  crowds come in  crowd control  yeah i i i know  a guy that got  arrested last year  when the black  expo was on  what is the black  expo sir what is  the black expo 
[01:23:00]  oh they have  they have uh  about a week  of uh everything  is is all centered  around um  the black community  oh yeah games  and and stuff  like that  i have a white  expo can i do  that can i do  that i have that  it'd be nice you  could but uh i  imagine somebody  complaining i would  guess they would  too yeah all right  so the black expo  they roust some  people the indy 500  uh nascar they uh  get a little uh  rambunctious 
[01:23:30]  yeah sometimes  zero tolerance with  crowds i guess they  have that thing you  ever watch cops and  you see like uh  during mardi gras  there is no there  is no talking  there's no explaining  it is all right  here's your mission  go out you see  anyone fucking up  take them down  cuff them and drag  them away there's  no bargaining with  a cop at mardi gras  or i would guess any  of these other big  events one of the  greatest things to do  is hang out on a  balcony and watch 
[01:24:00]  the the cops come  in with the horses  with the horses  that crowd control  they can control a  giant crowd  with like two  fucking horses  and they don't  have the horses  carefully no  they're banging  into people that's  their job  jimmy and i saw  that go down  yeah it's big ass  horses just pushing  right into the crowds  for crowd control  fantastic and man  you'll move out of  the way of a horse  in a second  yeah all right ron  thank you man  thanks guys  you're about the  uh national socialist  uh movement  uh sponsoring a highway 
[01:24:30]  highway cleanup  there in uh where's  denver  no  yeah  and then people  are a little up in  arms that they want  to keep the highway  clean  you know it says  this stretch of  highway clean by you  know the boy scouts  or something like  that  apparently the uh  national socialist  party decided they  wanted to uh  yeah there's a sign  they want to help  out  they want to help  out  they want to clean  up the highway  uh they're they're  a little  ethnically they want  to  ethnically cleanse  the highway  oh is that where 
[01:25:00]  the problem was  oh okay i thought  they just meant  they got they got  confused they thought  they were paying for  a chain gang  ah it's a different  definition of taking  out the trash  yeah nazis want to  clean up yeah well  apparently they put  the sign up um i  guess uh is anybody  really complaining all  that much  i guess not  i think in uh one of  the news stories that  i had heard about  this uh i think  the one of the major  concerns was that  people would research  the the the party that  was sponsoring this and 
[01:25:30]  then be then become  interested in it so  they were saying well  they're using a sign  as like a recruiting  technique in a way  okay do you know  national socialism is  a legitimate political  party i mean it's uh  you know some people  find it very repugnant  and and the history of  course is not um all  that stellar but uh it  is just in essence a  political party uh so  why can't they just  sponsor a stretch of  road like anybody else  could yeah there you go  all right good for them 
[01:26:00]  one more on uh tasing  listen to this story from  tim in new york  tim  hey what's going on  guys hey tim  hey uh me and my  buddies were in iraq last  year and we uh we got  our hands on a taser  just found in a box  somewhere we're not  allowed to we're not  allowed to bring it  outside the wire or  anything anymore so  we're just bored one  night and walking  around kind of you can  it was one of those  tasers you can either  hit people with it or  you can shoot the barbs  yeah i don't know if  you know what i'm  talking about yeah  and uh so we decided 
[01:26:30]  me and my buddy decided  we're gonna you know  decide to see what it  felt like we're gonna  tase each other and my  buddy who was a uh he  was an army captain huge  guy uh six six four  two fifty something like  that just a big boy and  we uh we're out in front  of this old building that  we lived in and we set  up all these old  mattresses in front of  them figuring he was  gonna fall forward when  we tased them but we uh  we shot him in the back  and it's like your back  muscle would lock up  completely and i mean  he just fell straight  down like a like a  pillar going down and  like it landed straight 
[01:27:00]  back on the tile and  those little barbs are  shot that we shot him  with like he landed on  so hard that they went  all the way in like  past where the wires  were and back and we  had to go go have the  dot take them out  how stupid we were for  for uh shooting each  other with tasers  how come when he fell  like a pillar he didn't  just land softly  jesus oh god i know  oh my god all right  tim good story brother  all right thanks again 
[01:27:30]  we're gonna step aside  take a quick break  obi and anthony you  know perfect timing on  that because uh they're  doing a story on the old  pope yeah yeah pope john  paul what there's a book  coming out on the pope  the old pope i gather i'm  so irritated because they're  going why he's a saint  yeah will you stop it  sainthood i'm not saying  he wasn't a great guy or  a giving or a loving guy  or a genuine decent person  or a lover of all that 
[01:28:00]  stuff forgiving guy but  enough they said pope  john paul ii he whipped  himself with a belt even  on vacation and slept on  the floor as acts of  penance to bring him  closer to closer to  christian perfection  that doesn't make you a  saint whipping yourself  with a belt what is this  same thing all about i  don't know i know they're  a pretty good football  team but what if you're  good one chip yeah yeah  it's saints what they 
[01:28:30]  was he playing the uh  the quarterback or  something what is  sainthood all about after  you die then you get this  thing it's just it's how  do you how do you it's  ridiculous how do you go  to the podium and pick up  your award though exactly  you know it's a big thumbs  up oh my god here's a  public relations disaster  what they're playing  mason the haitian look at  they're macing no they're  not the haitians yes they  are really but they've  suffered enough starving  haitians because they are 
[01:29:00]  not um standing in line for  their food oh they're  getting a little rambunctious  so they just took those big  industrial mace things look  at this see they slide to  the fence oh my god and  then they're so they the  the military was macing  them well they're hungry  yeah well you can't blame  them they're hungry at this  point and then everything  you eat after your mace is  cajun yes it tastes very  cajun why did a man do  that he ruined my pudding  caribbean jam caribbean jam  i don't like when he mace me 
[01:29:30]  it hurts my goddamn face it  hurts your face yes it makes  my eyes all runny and makes  my eggs taste bad why don't  you just stand in line and  wait your turn for the food  because i'm hungry stupid it's  been two weeks and them  serving ice cream it's hot  i told the man i got to go to  the bathroom and he maced me  he maced you god damn  i love caribbean jimmy  that is just a nightmare 
[01:30:00]  yeah they gotta mace them  because uh if not it's gonna  be about a riot well you want  to go haiti or you want to  continue with the pope thing  and the sainthood i don't  get the same thing yeah we  talk about the same thing  okay well uh they want it  now is the argument that  they want to no you didn't  explain what sainthood give  them a saint what these  religious people die and  then they're up for  sainthood yeah but what does  that mean there's a certain  criteria to become a saint  right like mother teresa  didn't she become a saint or  something like that i don't 
[01:30:30]  know what i know you gotta be  like good you have to have  one confirmed miracle  yeah that's like that's one  of the things for holy shit  what what was the pope's  confirmed what was her  confirmed miracle yeah let's  start with her old terry what  was her confirmed miracle i'm  not sure and who confirmed it  yeah that's a miracle the  miracle maker did yeah what was  the miracle wow miracle maker  it's a miracle maybe we're  overdoing ted but i can't 
[01:31:00]  handing out sainthoods right i  just don't know it's in charge  of sainthoods can we just look  up her miracle we're looking up  her miracle her one confirmed  miracle who the fucking i i  really i've had enough and  this is all religions can you  stop just stop it that's the  only thing i wish it was that  easy jimmy yeah right be a lot  less problems in the world i'm  just gonna go yeah jim you know  what that jim norton's correct we  gotta just stop i tell you  that a lot less wars a lot less  people dying the idea of 
[01:31:30]  sainthood is almost childish  yeah we just stop it's a god  it's like i don't this is one  thing i don't like about the  idea of the pope i i hate when  people go holy father it's like  you're supposed to address god  that way oh not a guy oh holy  father totally do well he's  infallible he's not infallible  he's a man i'm a man my name's  friend like yeah i'm a man like  you like you what uh what's the 
[01:32:00]  problem because i don't like the  idea that if you want to talk to  god you got to go to a priest and  it's like i don't like the fact that  these people are middlemen to god  just talk to god i'm with you if  you got to wipe your ass every  morning you know you're not a holy  father it's the concept of it that  drives me crazy well organized  religion drives me absolutely insane  there jimmy uh 2002 the vatican  recognized as a miracle the healing  of a tumor in the abdomen of an  indian woman monica of besra following 
[01:32:30]  the application of a locket containing  mother teresa's picture monica of  besra said that a beam of light  emanated from the picture curing the  cancerous tumor who believes that  maybe it's the photographer who's the  same with a locket maker as jimmy  screams that the answer would be  millions and millions and millions of  people jimmy but i'm saying  unfortunately it doesn't make  fucking sense of course not and then  the same lady song the virgin mary in  cornflakes yeah cut the shit that 
[01:33:00]  really is a non-miracle  unconfirmable what's wrong with you  guys you don't believe in wizardry all  right dr ronjan mustafi who told the  new york times he treated besra said  the cyst was not cancer at all but a  cyst caused by tuberculosis he  insisted it was not a miracle she took  medicines for nine months to one year  exactly thus curing the cyst so he says  that and the church is going what no this  is the closest we got we're doing it 
[01:33:30]  yeah we're going for it they had to find  something well they had to make uh yeah  they want to make a saint too many years  without a saint they had to come up with  something apparently you need two  miracles to become a saint just one to  become blessed oh is she blessed  or is she a saint oh yes she's  blessed uh god wanted her saint he'd a  miracle that tumor out of that one  blessed is blessed but saying it  differently it's like forked river new  jersey it's fucking blessed and forked 
[01:34:00]  blessed wait wasn't there a book that  had the word bless oh multiple  blessed bings i just want to bring back  a little bit multiple blessed bings so  she had multiple blessed bings yeah  what's another who's the last saying  who's the last person elected saying  hold on this guy knows a little  something about mother mother terry uh  what do you know on mother terry chris from  arkansas uh yeah i read a book and what  they said is when they tried to make her a  saint one of the miracles was supposedly  where uh early on in her career they had a 
[01:34:30]  documentarian that was uh filming her in  this uh low light situation in india and  he supposedly used film that should not  have really gotten a good exposure at  that light level and then when they  developed the film it looked all  beautiful and they were like oh my god  it's a miracle look at this heavenly  light shining down on oh my do you are  you kidding the case of the of the camera  improvement oh my good golly holy shit  you know what it was amazing it was a low 
[01:35:00]  light thing and all of a sudden the  digital camera the quality was beautiful  supposedly later though the the  cinematographer came out and said that  it was actually a different film that had  just been developed and it actually was  good for low light of course it was not a  miracle that a picture came out clear she  can't if she can cure cancer really how  about you run through sloan kennery  yeah why don't you take a jog down the  eye of the fucking hallway in sloan  kennery just touch people i got it i got  it i got it i got it i got it i got it 
[01:35:30]  i got it i got it i got it i got it  no that would be giving them more  cancer  i got it i got it i got it i got it  cancer for you and you and you and you  her second miracle was supposedly  curing cancer i think after she died  some lady put a medal on it was from  her representative mother theresa and  cancer was cured but supposedly that one  the devil's advocate basically said said  yeah yeah a little locket i had a brain 
[01:36:00]  to him i put my wig on i went away yeah i  crushed him guy had hammer toes i put my  lifts on i'm a saint  continued success somewhere colin quinn is  yelling at his radio i know he hates that  yeah all right chris well you're we're  learning about miracles you know and and  if we do believe in miracles does that  mean the 1980 u.s hockey team they're all  saints now uh yes there was a there was a 
[01:36:30]  miracle going down in 1980 yeah they got  to have sainthood at this point right  anything else on mother uh terry there  chris uh that's it but uh just for the  record i don't believe in miracles  why sounds to me like an ugly life  who sang that great song do you believe  the remote of goals i believe in miracles  oh it's i believe came along you sexy  thing you sexy thing you i believe in  miracles i said to the tumor continued 
[01:37:00]  success because i root for the cancer i put  a little wig on it  travis we want to hear a little i believe  in miracles who did that song aunt do you  know temptations hell spinners uh spinners  teddy pender ass  i believe hot chocolate everyone's  saying okay really hot chocolate i was  just naming black artists what a dumb  name for a band exactly believe in  miracles  the pope would whip himself with a belt 
[01:37:30]  oh yeah why sleep on the floor it's  like what are you what acts of penance  are those if you if you're sorry you're  sorry what else is the pope supposed to  do how about living a happy life and  just being nice to people which i think  he was let's get the rest of this story  out in a new book perkei santo why he's  a saint the polish prelate spearheading  john paul ii's bid for sainthood says  the pope practiced self-flagellation  whipping himself with a belt to emulate 
[01:38:00]  christ's suffering according to the book  john paul comes a little short i think  that comes a little short whipping  yourself with a belt and being beaten  bludgeoned and nailed to a cross he  probably just like being spanked me oh as a  man hey as a man i'm talking about the  man yeah that's all he was was a man just  a man the man part of the guy might have  liked a little  you know it's and found a little loophole  you know what if they want to hand out  this fucking miracle bullshit how about  the fact that you're made of nothing but 
[01:38:30]  goop yet like you can see shit like your  eyeballs are just goopy round things but  you could see through them how about you  shove your dick in a vagina and a new  person's made holy fuck that's a goddamn  miracle that used to be known as a miracle  yeah really isn't it's just a bunch of  fucking goop making more goop that like  goop can make shit and see shit and your  brain is nothing but goop but it holds all 
[01:39:00]  these stupid memories and everything it's  not i can understand if it's like a  machine but like the the idea that goop  makes electricity and fucking holds little  memories and little cells that's fucked up  right there everyone's a saint why  couldn't we have the iphone 100 years ago  though why i think that shit i don't  think we could figure that shit out why  they have now it's an i rock you just  hold a rock and touch it it does nothing  that'd make you a saint if you walk from  one end of sixth avenue to the other and 
[01:39:30]  you don't get your call dropped then you  should be fucking nominated for  sainthood that would be an iphone right  sure would we're learning more about  the miracle process uh bill w in  connecticut bill oh bill hello bill  happy birthday jimmy all right uh yeah  become a saint the second miracle has  to be uh after death the second miracle  has to take place after you die how do  they attribute it to you what do you got  to do call somebody or fucking uh do the 
[01:40:00]  what to see in front of a whole bunch of  people what if you're performing like if  their if their picture will heal you or  something so again i think it should be the  photographer but that's ridiculous too  because what if you're performing the  miracle from beyond the grave and no one  was paying attention what if the person  wasn't looking at the right moment when  you're you're performing your miracle from  beyond the god makes sure he does yes so  you're saying pretty much you have to be a  zombie in order to become a saint because  you have to do something after you're 
[01:40:30]  dead yep and one miracle before your  death though so they're they're pretty  strict that's a little strange zombie  saints i think it's easier to believe in  santa claus than uh then you know hey i  wake up the heavenly father presents under  the tree that's all i know that was a  miracle everything else is based on  complete faith when it comes to religion  at least there was a substance that it was  a fucking bicycle under the tree you're  like how did you know santa how did you  know and the cookie had a bite mark in  it so you knew santa had been there yes 
[01:41:00]  yeah i never knew at that point that it  was my father biting the cookie oh jim  drinking the milk yeah when'd you find  out well my girlfriend hates when i'm  jim chipperson because she hated chip so  much that i would just start doing chip  lines as me and she said it was so much  worse like with the way it would come  over and he'd say something oh that's a  little pricey wait what are the chicken  gonna walk over oh no it would dry she's  like i fucking hate jim chipperson now the 
[01:41:30]  guy can't even think all right he's doing  like a character no one's that stupid that  girl would not be with him talking like  that just want to jump in for a second we're  gonna be talking to the jet fan that or the  jets fan that got tased but did he just  oh i was just here he's on local tv here in  new york and he's doing our show next we got  him he looks like he just this thing yeah  it looked like he pulled his arm away when  the cop tried to yank his arm back and it's  like even if you shouldn't be getting  arrested you can't do that the cops pulling  your arm back you gotta let him cuff you  you're not gonna give up you're not gonna 
[01:42:00]  win by resisting that's for sure uh hmm he's  not gonna go okay we made a mistake no no  cuffing yeah maybe maybe we could define  our own miracles today like oh other  miracles hey jim you're covered it's a  miracle that would be one oh my god yeah  like if i don't know maybe we could define  our own miracles thinking i can think of a  miracle yeah like if a man was swinging his 
[01:42:30]  penis in a helicopter circle and jujubees  were flying out of a hole into the mouths  of hungries that's a miracle yes into the  hungry why aren't the miracles really  amazing yeah really fun like completely suck  now in the old days it was you know  fucking but yeah you're walking on water  you do the water and the wine parting the  red sea that's a miracle see you're doing  miracles you're real miracles what was that  about did it ice over or something what  happened what no moses what's the 
[01:43:00]  explanation that staff up and yelled let  my people go and yeah seas parted up and  what was moses 800 when he died they  lived a long time yeah back then i'm not  giving up on this miracle thing and greg in  new jersey has one greg carol mike  how about sully sullenberg as a pope that's a miracle  ah sully what sully did that that's more of a 
[01:43:30]  miracle than the dumb sis being fucking cured  yes so sully sullenberg is now a saint in our  eyes yep very good sir sully that was a miracle  right i know it was a miracle no one died he  lands a frig big jet in the river come on but he that's  only one so now after he dies he's got to do  something else yeah like his picture will have to  hear heal people yeah like people with overactive  sex drives will look at his fucking bj honey cut  mustache and be cured what if he had a magical 
[01:44:00]  mustache  and for you to be healed he has to put his nose in  your vagina and tickle your asshole with his stash  his mustache great gag he sure is that especially if it's a scam  you think he might have a magical mustache i think he does  mustache if he shaved that day everybody would have died that's it  they would have died oh back to this oh someone else wants to know of uh the  newsreader said uh self flatulence instead of uh the other instead of 
[01:44:30]  flatulence like he's just farting yeah sounded kind of like that john paul  the second often slept on the bare floor while serving as bishop in poland  as a spiritual exercise of self-denial why he's a saint also reveals the late  pope actually forgave his would-be assassin in the ambulance on the way to the  hospital after he was shot in saint peter's square on may 13th of 1981 the  pope publicly forgave his attacker four days after the assassination attempt and  visited him in prison two years later the vatican must confirm a miracle 
[01:45:00]  attributed to john paul's intercession in order for him to be  beatified that's not news no here's the thing i'm sorry wacky story the pope  look was you you can't say the guy wasn't a good man i he really he's probably a  very sincere and loving guy he forgave the guy that doesn't make him a saint he  was just look he believed in forgiveness and the guy by the way who shot him was  crazy oh yeah yeah he's a nutty motherfucker he's out now sure he's gonna  write a book yeah they let him out is he writing a book who's gonna read it 
[01:45:30]  babble babble pope oh interesting babble babble you guys are an idiot i'm sure the  pope is a nice guy turning a blind eye to all those abused children so oh yeah it's a  good point it's a miracle i like the new one better yeah because he addressed it  yes he was in the hitler youth and the other pope was too conservative  yeah listen guys um sure the listeners are going with the miracle thing i kind of  set up okay we got steve c uh calling from down the hall oh no  yes steve c to burning if i show up to work on monday is that a miracle yes i actually went 
[01:46:00]  after a big guest and got him i want my sainthood i didn't eat a cheeseburger this morning  i put a video up without the foundry logo put my picture in the church quickly  saint steve put my mouth down uh that's great yes i'm saint carlisi we have a stop-in guest 
[01:46:30]  oh hey bobby bobby texted me and told me he was coming sit man hi bobby uh let's go to  fucking one-way motherfucker oh shit hold on we'll get to you in a second uh who is this  kid in south dakota yeah gentlemen you in front of a large crowd of people performed a miracle  when you cured wheelchair fred of his crippledness ah let me tell you and i have been through a lot  over the years and one of my one of my top five moments easy was the time anthony decided decided 
[01:47:00]  to cure wheelchair fred in front of a packed house up there in boston i made him get out of his  wheelchair and take uh about a step and a half until he fell flat on his face in front of everybody  and the crowd wanted to kill me oh with horrendous feedback because he grabbed the mic stand thinking  that was going to help him to balance everything fell it fell over all you heard was and he crashed  on the floor right on his face and then the beauty of boston because there are animals up there they 
[01:47:30]  went from loving us to hating us within a second and everything we gave out that night they started  whipping at us on stage i was so into it like i got caught up and i'm like you are healed now walk you  are healed and i had my hand on his head he's like i'm healed i get the wall guy yield and he  started getting up and i'm like this motherfuckers i go i got powers i got powers step in half wham  right on his fucking face because he had really strong arms so he was able to lift himself up so 
[01:48:00]  it looked like he was kind of standing but his legs no weight on his legs were still dead but we  didn't know that at the time and then it's like let go of that wheelchair now let go and walk  walk toward the crowd and he's screaming because he's getting into it he thinks there's a miracle  about to happen and oh i've never seen a body fall better in my life and then all of a sudden the cds  and probably the the waf ice scrapers whatever the hell we gave out started being thrown at us all of  the swag came back i think i think it's one of the only gigs we actually had a bell we were in deep 
[01:48:30]  trouble because people were fucking pissed i didn't like that we made a cripple fall on his face  no there's a vagina and i'm keeping my erection it's a miracle  nominate me for sainthood quickly oh you should say that steve c on the line call back yes steve c  yes this is saint steven the patron saint of glory holes and my miracle was that i walked on a lake of 
[01:49:00]  cum and then drank it yes i turned water into cum yes oh my god let's go to bill in virginia bill  talking about miracles bill good morning boy hey morning bill i have severe ibs so i have a dry clean  wipe i consider that a small miracle that would be a miracle see now we're talking miracles bowels are 
[01:49:30]  all irritable i cut a fart and steven shot out onto the back of my ankles it's a miracle  because it wasn't in my hiney i swallowed it  let's go to tim in north carolina tim my stomach is back to its original size it's a miracle  i have defied the doctors oh fuck is that good tim the parting of the red sea was actually uh the 
[01:50:00]  tide going out of course it was standby of course it was oh then how did human beings survive if  they thought that was a miracle they're idiots they saw the tide going in and out right every day  after day maybe it was a tsunami or something and then the water was now going back to where it was  supposed to be it's just silly yeah well it was a big storm right it well it was hard it also  cause the party of the red sea yes it was a conspiracy they painted the water with thermite paint 
[01:50:30]  you know what dude it's a miracle i went fishing and i caught something  i didn't catch anything oh a miracle there well it's because you didn't have the miracle gift  and i certainly did not i don't like and then the asshole wanted to catch a fish for me like i was  eight years old i'm like no i'll catch my own fucking fish i'll catch him you can reel him in 
[01:51:00]  that's what he actually that's what he's actually pulling on me i'm a fucking grown man yeah oh he  spent 200 bucks on that fucking jackass i liked him actually the vietnam vet that looked like he was  gonna kill us at any moment tony tony get a flask tony he couldn't go he couldn't go a lousy  hour or two without drinking he kept disappearing i'll be right back oh like we don't know what  you're doing colin quinn should be nominated for sainthood oh you know i talked to people and they  understood me it's a miracle you know well patrice had patrice should be nominated he had a nice 
[01:51:30]  interaction with a white woman it's a miracle nominated for sainthood  what's up bobby oh what's up man yeah bobby texted me he's like i'm coming in well yeah one  of your freaking interns called my house at seven and they don't even it just comes up four six nine 
[01:52:00]  on the caller id and you didn't leave a number he goes the guys want you to call in click  and then and i live i live four minutes away from the studio yeah there's no way i'm calling in  when i can walk up here and i have nothing else to do anyways i am a little upset you are because i  heard some yes because i have a good friend that uh i work with on a daily basis named jimmy norton  yes i i'm well aware there seems to be some type of movie production going on if you want to call 
[01:52:30]  that you have something to do with yes yes i'm one of the producers yes the producer and jimmy  norton was not even asked to participate in said movie right uh which what is he a piece of shite  no no now no you need okay this better be a good excuse as to why he isn't being utilized  well you know what happened and uh this is what i found out yesterday no this is no is that 
[01:53:00]  this is not you know we all you know me and joe de rosa and billy burke came up with this idea  all right all right uh from reality joe wanted to cheat on his girl and i sat with him for a couple  hours giving him all my advice on how to cheat on a bitch did you tell him that he should fucking  slide into the room and sing i go from rich to riches with his fucking big ragu hairdo  or did you tell me he could probably crawl into something the size of a quarter because he has no  shoulders yes you just slipped it like a garden snake and then uh you know whatever billy burke 
[01:53:30]  got involved we were like you know you know we should we there's a lot of funny shit said we're  like why don't we just film it because we have nothing going on at least me i have nothing going  on so why don't we just film some of this just do it and then it got to the point where you know  comedy central bought it and they were going to do it and blah blah blah and then we took it back  because comedy central wanted to own everything yeah and do everything so we took it back and said  we're gonna pay for it ourselves and joe had asked i want to direct it and we were like you know what 
[01:54:00]  go ahead you guys the little rascals well we're putting on a show exactly and uh joe was we let him  direct it and get everything together because he wanted to and uh i i'm literally no i i got treated on  the first of all i didn't cast it joe cast it all right there it was okay okay hold it after all  the talking you just did yeah i finally heard you just pass the buck to joe but wait a second  there you go it was basically i was thinking of this you know calling for the thing okay fine 
[01:54:30]  you know what i mean because there's only like six rolls in the whole it's 15 minutes long there's  six rolls you have three of you yeah so you needed three more people we need oh this gets even  better colin and who else colin and then um bonnie okay because we needed a we needed a mediocre  chick that joe could maybe fuck oh fuck jesus uh and then which is great casting if you ask me 
[01:55:00]  and then we have uh jessica the girl from the cell the highway who's the girl that joe wants to fuck  right which is you know never fucked him in high school and now saw him do a comedy show and wants to  fuck him which is totally believable all right okay and then we got uh vos is a doorman  what he's the doorman you can't play it well because he wasn't smart enough he was tough enough  he wouldn't allow bonnie to be in it unless he was was that no because a towel we uh joe originally 
[01:55:30]  wanted to tell he had he had to tell to play the doorman but it tells a flake and what didn't call  him back or whatever he doesn't call anyone back now what's wrong with jimmy norton being the doorman  absolutely but at the time when we were casting this jimmy is first of all one of my only friends  is probably working all the time look at look at jimmy in the eye jimmy's one of my look at me jim  jimmy's making sad pouty face she's the sweetest boy jimmy jimmy jimmy jim look at me 
[01:56:00]  look at me okay look at the acting i um yeah look actually i can't be acting i would love to have  you in the movie i really would be in the movie but and um i just didn't think you had the time  because you're very busy going back and forth from la and the tv in this show and all the other  things you do but nobody asked yeah no one even asked about his schedule or anything that should 
[01:56:30]  be up to jimmy to decide how come joe would think that dave has the time he has a better career than  i do he's more famous than i do why would joe think that colin quinn has the time because he does  this really sounds like a bunch of lies first of all first of all the decision was made colin quinn  has the time he does i mean i you don't jim jim huh jim jim i love you man but you left him out  i didn't the whole i didn't production i'm not i'm i'm a producer you know what i am i'm money 
[01:57:00]  well the producer's technically in charge yeah that's what i thought until yesterday i almost  fucking i almost got got into a fight i i had all my rage all that respect shit you know i have  respect you don't respect me i'll fucking i want to stab you in your fucking eyeball and fucking rip  your fuck finally i'm on a movie set where i should be treated nice and not be fucked with  treated like a piece of shit yeah the fuck i almost got a fight with the guy yesterday he oh he little 
[01:57:30]  passive aggressive little fuck he wanted me to sit in at this thing to sit you know for camera but now who  is this the fucking assistant director oh oh he fucking this motherfucker he's got more power over  you the producer no it was uh there was two things that happened yesterday that fucked me up i was  looking at the monitor and he turned it i was like what is this what is that he goes just don't look at  that and i almost got up and and went don't you fucking i fucking bought that fucking monitor you  but you know because i'm a psycho so i just said you know just chill out bobby chill out yeah and then 
[01:58:00]  there was another thing where billy has to open a door and i said billy just give me two beats because  it's a big steel door and i didn't want to get it in the face yeah and uh the guy was like you need  to open it quicker well some somebody he billy said somebody told me to open it slower and he goes  whoever said that was wrong he knew i said it oh shit and i was like i don't like you well i go  you know i said that's i was like dude if he opened the fucking door it would have hit me in the fucking  face so who's wrong and that was like uncomfortable so now look at these fucking prima donnas oh dude 
[01:58:30]  but i had a great i had to pull i had to pull away fucking amateur fuck you oh it was terrible  look at you it was terrible but i think what happened was is i don't think any of these people  joe hired because joe did a lot of work he really busted his ass but i think all these people he hired  think that he's the guy and he's the uh-huh i think they just answered one project right yeah well  yeah what kind of uh what kind of equipment what is this being uh it's a 15 minute film it's being 
[01:59:00]  put on the you know it's a good camera i mean look i i was surprised yesterday how good it looks is it  digital or is it uh film it's uh digital but if it's 15 minutes long could it be called a film  short film yeah it can only be 15 minutes long to get in festivals any over you won't get in any  festivals what a prick that de rosa is yeah see let's get now it's de rosa now de rosa gets called  out and garen fucking teed he passes the buck to burr or something no he won't i don't need to 
[01:59:30]  get de rosa on the phone he's not smart enough to pass the buck yeah he'll try to but he'll give it to  himself come on man i just thought look i was gonna do it but then i realized i didn't like you  i'd say he had a chip on his shoulder but i'd probably slip right off he doesn't have a shoulder  on his shoulder i was on a bunch of shoulders one time he's uh he's actually he actually doing a  good job i mean he i saw it yesterday some of the footage joe i really fucking surprised the shit 
[02:00:00]  is he is he really directing or is he assistant director do you have a do you have a dp the whole  yeah a director has to think of the whole movie before it beforehand put it all together sit down  with the everybody his crew and then said this is what i want and figure out how to get it so he  you know the shots and all this crazy shit he's putting in there and like the opening shot i was  like that look i mean i was like fuck this looks kind of good i mean the content isn't you're not  going to be fucking i'm not let's just not get carried away you're not going to it's not like 
[02:00:30]  everybody's going to be like this should be a movie it's not going to happen it's going to it's  going to go to a couple festivals maybe win a couple things little things that mean nothing not have  jimmy norton in it no why would it what have i ever done for de rosa exactly i didn't i didn't uh  i didn't host an hbo show that him and burr were on because i tried to get bob on but i couldn't  because comedy central and you know what when you were out we never had him sit here so we could  plug gigs and stuff no no i thought i wasn't on hbo special because of the tourgasm thing  oh was that i think there was a lot of bridges burned in hbo for tourgasm and all that shit 
[02:01:00]  well i would honestly what i was told was was comedy central and there was other people they  vetoed that were comedy central that they had just done comedy central and uh at least that  was what i heard from the women who i don't think would have bullshitted me i mean uh but that was  what they said they said nobody just did comedy central because they wanted hbo's content to be  different right anyways jimmy i would have loved to have you in the movie all right we go to de  rosa now we'll get to the bottom of this oh we better want to take a break get uh joey on the 
[02:01:30]  phone hopefully yeah he's not too busy just not get that picture it's perfect he's filming right now  make him a big star like right now he's filming bonnie scene right now well fucking he could he  could put down the camera why would he say hey hey my friend who's been nice to me that's right i'm  doing a movie maybe i put a little parts a little hey yeah okay if i can't before we say joe who he  better get his uh ass on the phone and the second you did you just say de rosa's working right now  on the film so we can't call in no no no no no i just let you know what he's doing no no i didn't i

[02:11:30]  but i see your father's going with get comfortable gentlemen i see about pat your father's going with  the casual blue horse on his head a big horsey head on uh now now we we've been watching the video  it's been all over tv and the internet uh all day been watching this and um i i know nypd cops  pretty well i think they're a lot more lax and and relaxed when situations happen they'll just sit  there and blow it off and go hey guys just blown off steam uh did did these cops seem to be looking 
[02:12:00]  for some kind of trouble or i guess you gotta possibly actually pat walk us through it walk us  through because we're only seeing uh you know the video when yeah when the the cops are uh pretty much  yeah right there he's just like pushing you around and stuff yeah but before this we want to know what  was going on like walk us through yeah what started the whole melee i don't know i was just driving i 
[02:12:30]  was walking walking around cheering whatever uh they're they're driving through the you know the  tailgate i didn't know what they were doing why they were driving through the tailgate i never saw  anybody just drive through a crowd of people like that and uh you know i just i'm trying to get out of  the way still trying to have fun though or whatever um i just i kind of looked at the guy like i couldn't  see in the in the car or anything i was i looked over i'm like you know i couldn't really get much  further out of the way i just give him a little like the shrug kind of hey what's up here yeah what 
[02:13:00]  are you doing and uh you know immediately gets out of the car you're under arrest wow did he he didn't  tell you to say to me oh really yeah all kinds of shit wow did you say anything to him i said i'm  getting out of the way uh what are you what are you what are you talking about i don't know if i  said what are you talking about see right now he's putting it looks like danny go back a little bit  this is what we're just walk us through because it looks like the cop is uh he's hold on wait till  we get to the i want to fast forward a little bit he certainly does fling you on that trunk 
[02:13:30]  uh-huh jesus christ you know the cop car is really just driving right through the driving  through pia yeah there were two cars yeah two cars two cars and this guy gets out of the car he's  walking over to you right now but you listen he's pointing over your right here on youtube he says  he says what the fuck did you say to me oh can you turn it up do we have the volume you're fucking  you know help he's cursing we're gonna listen  get back get the fuck did you say to me all right you got a fucking problem you gotta fuck on my way 
[02:14:00]  fuck on my way he's a fuck on my way he's a fuck on my way he's a fuck on my way they single you out  they said i was cursing at everybody and i'm throwing beer and uh taunting other fans none of that is  true which which baffles me and i really don't see how they had any uh reason to arrest me i missed the  whole game i was just hold danny pause just one second yeah the cop does jump out and go what the  fuck did you say it is almost like like a schoolyard thing like uh you know the cop jumps out what the 
[02:14:30]  fuck did you say to me he said what what's your fucking problems yeah yeah yeah yeah that's father  man at uh now at one point because as i'm watching the tape it does look like you're not putting your  hands behind your back that kind of gets he didn't say anything he said get up against the car  and i'm like all right all right i get up against the car and then he's like you know i'm like what  what what did i do i might have said something like that and then i go to the back of the hood 
[02:15:00]  like he throws me the back of the hood i didn't know he wanted me to go to the back of the hood now  when he grabs your arms trying to pay attention you kind of pull that left arm away from him i did a  little bit i went like this and that's when he kind of gets a little rambunctious you know what do you  want me to do yeah yeah i didn't say that but i didn't know he was trying to get me to put my  hands behind my back i was trying to you know obey and just just get along as easy as possible  was pulling your arm forward kind of an instinct because you're just all of a sudden one minute  you're standing there the next minute you feel like you're being thrown against the car and like  what the fuck it was my instinct of like you know get off of me basically i what do you want you 
[02:15:30]  know plus the cop was treating him like it looked like the cop was trying to treat him like to bitch  him out like i'm i'm a batter ass fuck you and that's an instinct for a guy to be like fuck you  know so he puts you in the car and then on the next moment your arms are behind your back  like he and then you know my my arms behind my back and they're saying put your arms behind your  back put your and i'm like they are behind my back right now and at that time the taser was on my  back too and i'm like fuck yeah oh you got tasered i didn't actually get tasered he was you know i felt 
[02:16:00]  the charge and i thought i was tasered the whole time in like jail afterwards until until yesterday  somebody said the police reported out that uh i wasn't actually stunned or anything the picture  was ominous where they show the front page picture where he's like ah if he if he was actually tasered  he would have been on the ground like a piece of bacon yeah yeah that's what i thought i'm thinking  well if i was tasered i probably would have been a lot yeah so now did they did they what did what 
[02:16:30]  what did they charge you with if anything um disorderly conduct and um public intoxication  public intoxication how'd you think three beers two and a half two and a half you saw the beer  get thrown on the ground the third beer went on the ground right there you saw it how many hot dogs  did you have i had a decent breakfast so they had you been arrested before no no so you didn't yeah  know exactly you know hey i put my hands behind my back i didn't know what to do okay so uh and then they 
[02:17:00]  take you to some kind of holding facility where you then missed the the entire game entire game  eight hours to both games i uh i saw half of the jets game here and there and you know i like to  watch again i watched every game this year every game probably my life i don't know wow but you  weren't tasered i see i didn't know that so what what is the story now like like what you get put up  against the quad they probably from what it looks like it looks like maybe they overreacted a little bit  and they shouldn't have done that and the guy was alpha mailing and pissed off that you probably you 
[02:17:30]  know you're like yeah yeah that's what he so what are you what is the push of this is there a lawsuit  or or uh i'm not sure lawyer what do you think i think i think we're looking at it i mean i think  my take on this whole thing is that there hit a mic there lawyer there it is got me now actually  ron ron the lawyer thanks i i think you had some overzealous out of control police officers maybe  some overzealous colts fans i think if he didn't have a uh if he didn't have a jets jersey on this  probably they probably wouldn't have grabbed him i i also think i also think that that you know what 
[02:18:00]  the indianapolis people have to be concerned about and we don't blame the indianapolis people are the  colts but but we think this you know i'm saying if he had a colt jersey on it wouldn't happen i'm  saying the colts people come here to new york you know they come to the meadowlands hopefully there's  no retaliation by our local police but i think i think i'm concerned about i'm concerned about out  out-of-state out-of-state fans whether the police are not abusing our jets fans and and and i hope  that there's no retaliation by our local new york police or jersey police against indianapolis fans 
[02:18:30]  or fans from any other can i ask the attorney because like you figure it looked like i i feel  that man maybe they overreacted a little bit but you weren't beaten in custody or anything like that  you weren't injured by the police no i wasn't it sucks you missed the game sure huh but what what is  like what is when you when you sue what what are you saying we want like well let me just tell you  this when you're a 26 year old kid who's never been in trouble before and and if you look at that  film you see the way that cop grabbed him you see the way the cop tried to jam his head against the 
[02:19:00]  trunk of that police car you see the way they they pushed him around they treated him like he was their  punk like he was their bitch that's the way they treated him and and then they grab him they throw  him in the back of the car they lock him up they keep him in jail for eight hours they they kind of  they kind of tacitly coerces old man into into you know putting him in a diversionary program  paying 150 bucks and and letting him out so he won't have any kind of record and he can go home  if you don't think that traumatizes a kid you're wrong it does traumatize a kid because he's never  been in trouble before in his life well he's not a kid he's an adult but i'm not saying that you're 
[02:19:30]  right to be arrested but you are he's a kid to me well he's old enough to serve in the military  my my thing my issue is uh even though i agree it was it was it was it was an overreaction i do agree  with you but it was it was it just seems like what are you saying when you're suing them like  to get why maybe you should be refunded the game i'm saying airline tickets i'm saying i'm saying i'm  saying do something with the police you see what you had here was no more than a regular tailgate  party and you've been to a tailgate party at the meadowlands this is no different than what was going 
[02:20:00]  on there if you can't get the police who are trained well enough to handle a tailgate party which  is what this was retrain them reassign them kick get rid of them on the police force have the police  respondent damages somehow so that there's some some preventive measure that they won't do it  again wait can i yeah i know what jimmy's going to say and i'm i want to say the same thing you see  the police car going right through the tailgating party what was going on that they felt like they  had to break up that part of the uh of the parking lot with their police cars was i'm sure it's just  some yelling back and forth between the fans no no fights nothing like that right fights no so it was 
[02:20:30]  just a basic just kind of breaking balls probably they wanted the parking spaces i guess they said  they needed they wanted to make room for other cars to pull in so there's no real reason for them to  be aggressive with their cars to be no they they they wanted to make there was a lot of empty spots and  there were people that were gonna be coming this was two hours before the game there were people that  were gonna be coming that were gonna need spots you know they had permits but nobody came and said  we want to park and we're prevented right and they didn't come on a speaker and say hey we need to 
[02:21:00]  make room sure you know but the one guy with the with the whistle i think they were mad about him and  they and then they came back with a second car and that's when they drove through the crowd  and then uh then they then they wrote a report you know what you know what the worst thing about it  is they write a report an affidavit the guy signs that says pat was cursing throwing beer at people  and that he then went up to pat and some other guy and there was no other guy there when he got 
[02:21:30]  arrested but he wrote an affidavit saying that he arrested two people at the same time and he said i told  those two guys to stop and they refused they kept cursing at people and and then i put him under  arrest and you know when i saw that report when i got him out of jail i said to the prosecutor i said  no no this is the wrong report this isn't this isn't it and she goes no look there's his name on the  bottom i said well that's not what happened and it's on video so and then you look at the video and  you look at the report and it's two totally different things wow so you know they they lied on the  report okay and if they did it to him they're doing it to other people so you know were there any 
[02:22:00]  incidents that day because you're saying they should better train the police department were  there any incidents that day uh of any type of uh of police brutality or allegations that they  other than this event where where they they probably overreacted i don't know we don't know  i don't know and what are the cults what was their response have they had a response to you yet no  okay so what is it you want from them or the city well i i i want a couple things uh i pat  doesn't concern about an apology he's not concerned about an apology but i think he deserves one 
[02:22:30]  i think i think i'd like to see these police retrained i'd like to see him reassigned i'd like  to see him out of the way if i'm using the expression kids at these tailgate parties or adults  i mean if they don't understand that when there's an afc championship game and people come a couple  hundred miles to watch the game and guys like my two friends here who are rabid jets fans are going  to get you know the way people get at tailgate parties then get them the hell out of there  is tailgating legal there who have some self-discipline some self-control and if not  then they're going to have to pay they're going to have to pay some money so it doesn't happen to 
[02:23:00]  other people can i answer your question here with the president my only issue is you're saying like  you're saying control and stuff and again i don't was the cop really out of control yeah he was out  of control he didn't hit you look at the tape he grabs him hey hey look at look at look at the cop  who has the taser on the back of his neck ready to go he activated that taser he was ready to go i don't  know if the taser just didn't work at that time or if he didn't push that push that button to make  it go but that cop was ready to taser this kid and this kid didn't do anything what is the argument 
[02:23:30]  and and to single you got to look at the whole thing you can't just look at him slamming him  into the trunk he looked like he singled you out for no apparent reason like i didn't see any reason  why he would get out of his car even uh and approach you you were doing nothing different than  anybody else he didn't like your attitude that which is i don't think it's an arrestable  cops are nervous too they're regular guys and they're going into a uh driving into a all these 
[02:24:00]  guys testosterone they're insecure too they're real insecure you know and he was ready he was  ready to go though he was ready to go if they would have just kept driving there would have been  no problem most cops are insecure that cop going what the fuck did you that to me is signed the cop  is looking to be confrontational unnecessarily then i say why doesn't he just say what really  happened in his report i mean if if that's if if he felt that way why didn't he just say  what happened and why did he make up this crap about cursing throwing beer at people none of that 
[02:24:30]  happened that that's just crazy it's uh you know when you get into a fight though i mean he was  probably nervous too driving into a bunch of guys you get he wasn't in a fight when he wrote that  report in your head you don't the same thing you you don't know the details after you come out  you're like oh well i don't i was so crazy i don't know what happened you should have been  you know you know more responsible i think i'm not making an excuse yeah i know you're right  but no communication whatsoever to me i didn't i asked a few people what are they doing here nobody  knew i think a momentary overreaction by a cop in that moment right it doesn't justify retraining 
[02:25:00]  how to use that taser totally different i mean had he tased the picture on the front page of the  paper was like wow this kid got tased yeah and lucky for him uh you're a white kid because uh oh boy  if you'd have been a plunger if you'd have been a black kid that would have been all over johnny  that cop would be somewhere fired suspended something like that he'd have been shot he got  uh got cops home and they pepper sprayed him and he pooped his pants yeah he showed his pants and 
[02:25:30]  they should have pepper sprayed him he keep he was six cops a comedian we know well and he just  wouldn't put his hands behind his back as an ass then he goes like this pepper spray me bitch i  ate that for breakfast and they did and he went oh yeah and they gave him some breakfast and he  shit his pants he shit his pants oh my god why did i not know about this hold on we got a couple  really good phone calls coming in here if uh the lawyer get some headphones for the lawyer or roger  adultery  i can't wait to see you at halftime sir  he's on a show called kung fu and maybe the cop didn't like will ferrell movies or something 
[02:26:00]  it looks like will ferrell  russell peters has made  the show here uh let's say hi to mike in new york mike mike  call can you hear  hey what's going on hey mike  hey listen this guy got a bad beat all right what happened it sounds like  yeah he got assaulted and and and he he got he got a bad beat he got thrown in jail okay it happens  but jimmy i think you're hitting a fair point what are you getting out of this this is where the lawyers come in 
[02:26:30]  and i see this as a financial opportunity  the lawyers are going to hop all over it  you know like yeah i think you should be in reverse for your ticket reimbursed for your tickets  but these lawyers come in and they start telling them and telling them look financial opportunity  that's the problem with america today is that the lawyers are all over the place  well you think you think this is a an issue of financial opportunity for the lawyers then you're an asshole  how about that  because this guy's got nothing to do with financial opportunity jerk off  this has to do with the fact  this has to do with the fact that a kid who drove hundreds of miles to get to a football game 
[02:27:00]  to watch a team he's been chaired for since he was born  get thrown in jail for eight hours and get kicked around by the police  if you think this is a financial opportunity for lawyers  then you got some retraining to do yourself pal  did you fly or drive  you get do you do you get that you think this is a financial opportunity  i'm talking about retraining i'm talking about reassigning  i'm talking about not having some out of control asshole  grabbing a kid because he doesn't know how to handle a tailgate party  which is no different from any party that you might ever been to at the meadowlands 
[02:27:30]  you get that  do you get just do you get that  i think if you don't get that  if you don't get that then get the hell off the phone  because you're wasting my time  this lawyer's gonna taste you  wow all right let's go to the next call  we got someone calling from indianapolis steve steve  hey boys thanks for taking the call  uh you know first of all thanks for coming to indianapolis and spending your hard-earned money  we can use the cash here  second of all to the attorney  i believe you said it twice  that you hope that it doesn't happen to indianapolis sports fans when they come to the meadowlands 
[02:28:00]  by the local police  but i see that as a threat  and also by the way you just handled that last call  you're clearly doing a disservice to your profession  by calling somebody an asshole when you're there on the dime  come on dude  i'm not sure what your question is  but i but but but but you know what  but whatever whatever it is  if you perceive what i'm saying is a threat  i'm just telling you this  i don't  i don't  but there are those people who would think 
[02:28:30]  that if a jets fan goes out to indianapolis  and he's treated the way he was kid was treated out there  that it is possible  it is possible that we got some loose heads out here in the new york new jersey area  that might get a hold of somebody in a colt's jersey  a colt's jersey who had a few drinks  and decide to treat him the same way  how'd you like that if that was your brother your mother your father or your kid son  how would you like that  before you start talking about out of control  it sounds like he pulled away from the cop  which is clearly actionable by the police officer  to protect himself  he didn't pull the way pulled away from the cop 
[02:29:00]  you sound like you sound like somebody who'd be  defending rodney king  dude no i'm not  and in indianapolis police department by the way  they have to patrol this thing called black expo every year in indianapolis  which every black youth comes out  right  party his ass off  so now you're so now you're a racist on top of on top of being an asshole now you're a racist  now you're a racist now you're putting now you're putting the black white thing into this  what i know this is radio pal but this is these are white people we're talking about here 
[02:29:30]  this has got nothing to do with black people  you're not demonstrating your professionalism by using that type of words  i mean you can do that on the opening anything show  but come on you're there as an attorney  why don't you use some fucking formulas  why don't you use some regular words  like you just did  like fucking  like you just did  what do you do for a living character  what do you do  i'm a salesperson  you're a salesperson  what do you what do you sell  i sell pharmaceuticals  oh you sell pharmaceuticals  well that's a great industry  drug dealer  hey  you're a goddamn drug dealer is what you are 
[02:30:00]  hey listen friend i want to tell you this too  i want to tell you this now shut up and listen for a second  my friends tell me  that they they found everybody in indianapolis  to be some of the most gentlemanly kindest nicest people they  they had ever run across  and and and the statements we make about the police  involved in this incident  perhaps and i'm not sure  but perhaps some rogue cops  who lost control of themselves for a few minutes  what i'm telling you is  that's that is not to us  meant to characterize the entire folks out there in indianapolis  these guys tell me that they had 
[02:30:30]  they had a great experience out there  until this incident happened  they got nothing but high opinions of the indianapolis  folks out there  and probably the police out there are a good bunch  and we get it  you know what i'm a prosecutor locally where i come from  and and i i work with police on a regular basis  but i recognize there are rogue police officers out there  i'm not saying these are rogue police officers  but i'm saying these are not  these are not police officers who are to be able to handle  who ought to be assigned to handle tailgate parties  you really disagree with that  i mean if you looked at that tape  you think this kid  are you telling me you think this kid to be 
[02:31:00]  deserved to be roughed up  handcuffed thrown in a car  locked up for eight hours  are you telling me you think that was okay  are you telling me you think that was okay or not  he's uh he's gone there sir  all right  i have a question for the attorney  what's your name  i don't want to just run sage  do you handle cases of talent  who has disputes with the radio companies  wrong we want to talk after the show  we want to hire you to talk to our bosses  set them straight  you can sit  i want you to call them friend and pal  and champ and all that

I went to jail for eight hours.  You punched the cop.  You punched the cop.  Did you see this tape? 
[02:34:30]  Did you see this kid do anything?  You punched the cop.  Stop it.  Your problem is referring to him as a kid.  How old are you, pal?  I'm 43, sir.  And you punched the cop.  How old were you when you punched the cop?  How old were you when you punched the cop?  How old were you when you punched the cop?  How old were you when you punched the cop?  Were you over 30?  Yeah, whatever, dude.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever, dude.  Another asshole.  Okay, let's go. 
[02:35:00]  Jimmy, don't let this guy get off with this shit.  All right, let's go to Mike and Boston.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, this is for the lawyer.  You mentioned that you wanted the police in Indianapolis to be retrained.  Yeah.  And then you, which I can understand, but you also mentioned that you're worried about the  New York and New Jersey cops coming back at Indianapolis fans.  Do you have any intention of training or putting forth some sort of action to train these hypothetical 
[02:35:30]  New York and New Jersey cops that are going to rough up an Indy fan?  Hey, hey, hey.  You know what?  Have you ever heard of this happening in the Meadowlands?  And you haven't, have you?  And the reason you haven't is because down here we train our cops so that they know how  to handle tailgate parties, which is what this was.  This wasn't some out-of-control crazy affair.  This tailgate parties with young people and older people who were drinking or partying.  You said you're afraid of it happening.  Huh?  You said you're afraid of it happening.  Well, you know what?  I mean, frankly speaking, there are those people who saw this incident and said, 
[02:36:00]  what the hell are the Indianapolis police doing, if it's Indianapolis police?  I understand it's Speedway police or some adjacent town.  What are they doing thinking about tasering a kid for nothing?  And I'm saying that there are those people who might be thinking about, hey, you know,  maybe somebody with a cold jersey on ought to have a taser stuck on the back of his neck  and locked up for eight hours to see whether or not this is the kind of behavior that's  approved on.  That's all I'm saying.  You're worried about it.  So what are you going to, what action are you going to take to prevent that from happening  since you're so concerned about this happening in New York, New Jersey? 
[02:36:30]  Well, what action do you think I'm going to take, jerk-off?  I'm not the governor of the state.  I'm not the governor of the state.  I'm just another schmuck lawyer from a small town.  I'm just some country bumpkin from Freehold, New Jersey.  What the hell do you think I'm going to do about it?  I can't make the law.  Come on.  Because you want to make changes happen in Indianapolis, though, don't you?  I want these cops to be retrained or reassigned.  Sure, they can't handle crowd control.  They can't handle the tailgate party.  You want your kid to be at a tailgate party where this kind of crap happens to a 26-year-old 
[02:37:00]  guy?  I mean, for nothing?  You want your kid subjected to that?  You want him locked up for eight hours in front of his dad?  You want him to be traumatized?  That's not what I called about.  You think that's okay?  Then what did you call about?  Did you forget my question already?  I think you might have forgot your question.  You want me to come up with some retraining for the Meadowlands police who don't need it is  what I got, and I think maybe you're smoking something because you don't seem to get the  drift of this conversation.  Your comment earlier said you were worried about it happening.  Why are you worried about it happening? 
[02:37:30]  I'm concerned.  There might be some folks who think about retaliation.  Let me tell you something.  If this kid had a Colts jersey on, I don't think it would have happened to him.  But he had everybody like they're drunken assholes because they have a couple of drunken assholes?  Everybody says they always had a couple.  They have always more than that.  You think this kid was one?  Did you see the tape here?  No, I haven't seen the tape yet.  Then get off the phone.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Watch the tape.  Call me back.  Watch the tape.  Call me back.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin from Connecticut. 
[02:38:00]  Kevin.  I want to talk to the lawyer.  Yeah.  Ron is here.  Yeah.  Hey, Ed Asmark, can you back off the mic?  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  He was getting excited.  He was breathing.  Of course.  Yeah.  Ron, you were breathing about it.  I was breathing too loud.  You're going to stop him from breathing, asshole?  Let's go to Jonathan from Connecticut.  Jonathan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm an attorney in New York and Connecticut.  I agree completely with this attorney.  I just think he's made a slight error in not being more specific. 
[02:38:30]  There's no money involved in this for this lawyer.  He's not going to make jack shit.  Thank you.  It's a minimalist case.  It's something called deterrence.  He's trying to deter this shit from happening ever again.  Thanks.  Anybody else in any city.  You got it.  You got it.  New Jersey or Indianapolis or my fucking state of Connecticut.  You got it.  You got it, pal.  You got it.  Hey, does Pat have a record now?  Nothing.  Lacrosse.  No record.  No record for Pat.  He's got an arrest record, actually.  I was going to say, can you guys get the arrest record removed? 
[02:39:00]  Do you know that?  Well, he's not going to have a record when this is done because his dad, his dad.  Hey, let me have his dad answer that question.  Hang on a second.  The papers that he actually signed said that he had to, we were just trying to get out  of Dodge that night, and the papers that he signed for this agreement said that he can't,  he had to agree that he couldn't expunge the arrest record.  I didn't understand that, but, you know, it's a dismissal, but there'll be an arrest record. 
[02:39:30]  Why wouldn't they want, why would the cops want you to sign that?  Because does it make them look bad or like they waste the time if it's expunged?  Well, they wanted him to sign a paper that would basically, I think the idea behind it  was to relieve them from any potential liability.  And, you know, I think, you know, reading between the lines on that, that's what it says.  Whether it actually does or not remains to be seen.  Right.  If they drop the charges, then it's like, they're probably thinking you could step in  and go, all right, now look at what you did to me for nothing.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Instead of having some kind of charges there.  Yeah, yeah.  We got more people on the phone, too.  Oh, yeah, we got this guy from Long Island.  Sir, what do you got for the lawyer or Pat or Pat's father, Tom?  For the lawyer, what I have is, if you get a settlement or they offer you a settlement,  are you going to turn down a settlement and go through what you want to go through with?  Or are you going to take the settlement?  Well, see, first off, I have clients.  I don't make these decisions.  These decisions are made by my clients to what they want to accept.  But in terms of whether a settlement would be accepted, you know, I agree with the lawyer 
[02:40:30]  who just called in from, I believe, Connecticut.  And that is my primary focus.  My primary focus.  And there may be Indiana lawyers involved in this case or Illinois lawyers at some point  in time.  But my primary focus is to make sure this kind of crap doesn't happen again.  Period.  Okay.  Out there or anywhere else.  That's my primary focus.  My name is Taint Lover, by the way.  But anyway, what I wanted to say was, you know, the Taint Lover.  Who the hell named you that?  What the hell?  Your mother looked at you when you were born and said, I'm going to name you Taint Lover? 
[02:41:00]  Ooh.  The hell was wrong with your father?  Ooh.  Not all-inclusive of the whole incident.  Ooh.  Not all-inclusive.  And we'll find out at trial.  Ooh.  Yeah.  We'll find out.  Stay tuned.  All right.  We got Norm in Cape Cod.  Norm.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  This lawyer is just such a piece of trash.  He's a typical ambulance chaser.  For him to sit here and say he wouldn't make any money off a civil suit is a complete lie.  The kid signed off saying that basically that he had done something, and he signed off. 
[02:41:30]  He's done.  That's all.  End of discussion.  That's the end of discussion?  Then shut the fuck up and get off the phone, you stupid asshole.  You're completely wrong.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You talk like a goddamn asshole.  You don't have any common sense.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Did you even see the tape here?  Did you even see the tape?  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  You see the tape?  What do you think?  What did you see the boy do wrong?  You're an ambulance chaser.  What did you see the boy do wrong?  When you went to school... 
[02:42:00]  What did you see the boy do wrong before we shut off your mic?  What part of your lobe did you have removed when you went to get your outlaw?  You're a piece of shit.  That's all you are.  That's all you are.  You're an ambulance chaser.  Look at your own website.  Look at your own website, garbage.  Okay, nice talking to you.  Look at your own website.  Your own website.  Oh, I won't charge you until we get a cell phone.  All right.  Right.  All right.  Next case.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Ficious.  He's very bitter.  Where's Tom?  He wouldn't say what he saw on that tape, though. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, are you a single?  Hey, Ron, are you a family friend besides the lawyer?  It seems like you guys know each other for a while.  I've known Pat since he was born, and Tom and I used to work together for years.  Right on.  All right.  Let me say hi to Cody and PA.  I don't know what he wants to talk about.  Let's see.  Cody.  Hey, yes.  I just wanted to have a comment for Ron.  Sure.  He's the lawyer.  Yep.  Yeah.  There's lawyers like you who are like tampons to every push that that kid needs one.  Oh, that's a horrible joke. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, man.  What does that mean?  You are an obvious asshole, too.  I'll tell you.  This is...  Is this...  Is this...  I don't know.  You know, I say this is one asshole call after another.  I swear to God.  One stupid...  They said he was throwing beer at people.  He wasn't...  They even said that he tried to go up to them and tell them to stop, and he didn't.  You know, it's not just one...  I mean, it wasn't little mistakes that he made writing a report.  These were bold-faced lies.  I mean, he sat down and tried to explain why they treated him so badly, but unfortunately, 
[02:43:30]  it was on video.  Unfortunately, there was a New York Post...  Unfortunately for him, there was a New York Post photographer right there, and people  videotaping it.  And then, you know, he got caught in a lie.  I don't think that's unfortunate.  Someday, you guys are going to love that front page.  You know that.  Someday, you're going to love that one.  That was cool.  We've been on the front page before, and trust me, enough time goes by, you're like,  hey, that's pretty fucking cool.  And for the callers using profanity, serious calls only, please. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Ron, right?  Yeah, Ron.  Hey, how you doing?  I just want to say, you're a breath of fresh air.  I like how you are.  You shoot from the head.  You tell it how it is.  You know what I mean?  None of this...  More cliches.  ...for your garbage.  But I got to say, I hope you win this case, because there's a case in Philly where an  off-duty police officer shot a 19-year-old kid in cold blood at a party. 
[02:44:30]  These cops take their authority way too far, and they're trained to be level-headed when  they get into a situation.  These guys are just too quick with the trigger.  Absolutely.  Wow.  All right.  There you go.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  I don't know.  I want to say, I don't know the specifics of that case, but until I'm not passing judgment  on it.  You're a little bitter?  Sound like you've got a few issues.  Yeah, I do.  I have issues with fucking shysters who go after police officers for doing their fucking  job, you fat fuck. 
[02:45:00]  He doesn't even know what he looks like.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sorry, Bobby.  Hey.  He's actually in shape for an older guy.  He wasn't talking to me, Opie.  He was talking to Ron.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You fluctuate, Bobby.  Don't worry about that.  Fluctuating, Bob.  Bobby says, buddy, it's open.  Hey, hey, hey.  Have I still got you on the line?  Ron.  Yeah, we got him, Ron.  You still on the line?  Yes.  The Ron kind.  All right.  Are you still on the line here, pal?  Yeah, I'm here, you fucker.  All right.  Well, you do sound a little better.  Why don't you take a breath here for a second? 
[02:45:30]  Hey, listen.  Did you see the tape we're talking about here this morning?  Did you see the tape?  Why don't you go fucking shove your fist up your ass and jerk off on your fat wife, you  fucking scumbag.  Now he's just still not talking about me.  Somehow I'm thinking this isn't a productive conversation.  No, no.  I'm not saying this is being productive.  Jesus Christ.  Get rid of this asshole, will you?  All right.  We got some intelligence here.  Jeremy in New York.  Jeremy.  Oh, Ron, the lawyer is a cunt. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, stop.  How about some serious calls here?  Serious calls only.  Let's go to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, Fred from Brooklyn.  What's up, brother?  I just love hearing a real guy not talking legalese.  The guy is a straight shooter.  The lawyer is standing up for what he thinks is right, and he's saying it in real words,  not legalese, and you've got to pat him on the back for that.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I think you've got a lot of...  I like this guy.  He's got chutzpah. 
[02:46:30]  I think he's got a lot of fans, Ron.  I wish he was my divorce lawyer.  That's for sure.  That would have worked out well.  You don't talk like that in court, I hope.  Your Honor, do you really believe this cunt did what I said she did?  You know, the fact is I do have a few contempt convictions and a few reprimands, but...  Of course you do.  But they were all baseless.  Yeah.  Of course.  You're Jeffrey Tambor in Unjustice for All.  How do you two know each other, Ron and the father there, Tom? 
[02:47:00]  You guys go way back?  We go way back.  We go way back.  Fraternity brothers, what is it?  No, Tom and I actually worked together for about eight years back in the 80s.  Oh, there you go.  What went wrong?  He decided he had a way to make more money.  Oh, shit.  That's how I left you behind, right?  Left me behind.  Goddamn gutter.  Objection, Your Honor.  Objection overruled.  Well, aren't you an asshole? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, my God.  Probably has to judge what they do for a living.  What do you do, pal?  You look stupid in that faggity room.  These guys are doing a lot of media today, and I'm assuming it's a little different when  you're on, like, Fox News and all that, right?  Probably.  Just a little different.  Just blown off steam.  That's it.  We have another call for Ron.  We have another call for either one of these guys.  Pat, you're okay?  You're well represented.  Yeah, I'm okay.  Congratulations on this massive lawsuit you're going to win down the road.  All right.  Yeah.  A lot of good job, character.  Hopefully.  Let's go to Derek in Iowa. 
[02:48:00]  Derek.  Hey, morning, boys.  D-boy.  Hey.  Hey, Ron keeps mentioning a rogue cop.  I just thought, why don't you guys just ask Bob Kelly what this cop was thinking,  since he's another rogue cop.  Yeah, Bobby knows a lot about rogue cops.  Yeah, Ron, I'm a rogue cop, too.  He plays on TV.  Really?  Well, not yet, but it's coming.  Well, hey, let me straighten you out on something.  This may have been a rogue cop.  I can't clearly say this is a rogue cop.  I'm not saying it's a cop who has to actually have better control over his self-discipline 
[02:48:30]  and understand how to handle something on the level of a tailgate party.  I mean, come on.  That's all we're really talking about here.  You know, I'm not talking about a cop who shot somebody.  I'm not talking about a cop who, you know, who beat the shit out of somebody like a Rodney  King.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about somebody who just needs a little understanding about how to handle  crowd control at a tailgate party before a championship AFC game.  That's all I'm talking about here.  Do you want to see this cop fired, Ron?  No, not necessarily.  I'd just like to see, I'd like to see, as I say, retrained.  I'd like to see somebody talk to him.  I'd like to see him trained so that he doesn't think he can just grab a kid in a Jets jersey 
[02:49:00]  because he's in a bad mood.  Maybe he's an avid Colts fan.  He gets carried away and he starts thinking it's okay to slam a kid against the car, put  a taser against his head, and lock him up for eight hours.  You know, whether he's going to get fired or not, I'm not at messing with people's family  lives.  And I don't know anything about this guy.  He could be the nicest guy in the world under other circumstances.  Was he out of control that day?  Absolutely out of control.  And that's not a question of dispute.  There's no factual dispute here because we got it on video. 
[02:49:30]  You know, take a look at it.  Hey, tell me.  Ron, I got to ask you one more question.  Now, they're saying that Pat was drunk and unruly, right?  Do they ever give you a breathalyzer or a blood test or any of that to prove that you  were drunk?  It was just immediately in the car.  How do they give you public intoxication if they don't know?  They were making shit up.  Breathalyizing.  Were they nice to you while you were in jail after it was all over?  The stars were all really nice to you, yeah.  Do they have a TV so you could at least watch?  Yeah, but it was hard sometimes to watch.  I had to do all this other processing. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, too busy making sure you weren't raped, right?  Oh, come on.  No, that was pretty relaxing.  You get raped for six hours in jail.  Hey, man, if you're in a cell, you never fucking know who else is in there.  It's not the Oz.  Right?  Ron understands.  Ron knows.  Well, Ron, what about the San Diego incident?  Ron was worried about his safety while he was in jail.  There was a San Diego incident that I was informed of where a Jets fan was arrested for just cheering among the fans.  I saw the video.  What is that about?  Yes.  You know, I don't know what that's all about.  I haven't heard that. 
[02:50:30]  I haven't heard about that.  Okay.  That might be a good, maybe there is something about Jets fans.  We'll look into that.  It was a week earlier at the championship game in San Diego.  Okay.  Yeah.  He just talked about that.  I hadn't heard about that.  Yeah.  That was on YouTube also.  Adam in Brooklyn.  A lot of Brooklyn calls today.  Adam.  How are you doing, boys?  Pretty good.  I got a question for Ron, the lawyer.  Have you ever been thrown out of court before for saying objection jerk off or calling the judge a jerk off or something?  Well, I've been convicted of contempt at court, but never for calling the judge a jerk off.  I mean, there are times when I have felt like calling judges jerk off because, to be quite frank, there are those judges who one could reasonably describe with that terminology. 
[02:51:00]  But, frankly, no, that hasn't happened to me because, you know, we all have to control ourselves in certain forms because, you know, we all got to serve somebody.  That's what I do for a living.  So, I can't go calling people jerk off because I just disagree with them.  This is a different situation.  He knows in this forum, right.  He can express himself in a different way.  What you're hearing today is my reaction to seeing a young kid. 
[02:51:30]  Somebody objected to my calling him a young kid because he's 26 years old, but I've known him since he was two years old.  And watching a kid who I know has never had a problem in his life, who's not a drunk, who wasn't drinking much.  I looked at the video a dozen times, and I saw a kid being slammed against a car.  I saw a kid come next to being tasered.  I saw a taser pressed against his head.  I saw the look on the cop's face, which was vicious, as he looked like he couldn't wait to put that taser in action if this kid moved another inch. 
[02:52:00]  Watched him thrown in the back of a car, locked up for eight hours.  Come on.  That's what you're hearing today.  You're not hearing disrespect towards all authority.  You're not hearing disrespect toward judges.  You know, you're hearing my reaction to something that's a real injustice, and I want to discourage people from behaving like that again.  That's all you're hearing now.  I want to sue because we miss out on another good YouTube tasering.  Boy, you'd have been a big hit and everything, but boy, if you would have hit the deck, that would have been a good one.  You should have taken one for the team, man.  For everyone else. 
[02:52:30]  We love laughing at those videos.  It's like, I didn't do anything.  I'm not putting my hands behind my eyes.  I'll do anything.  Whatever.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's go to Brian.  Don't tase me, bro.  These guys are from Freehold, and we got Brian on the line from Freehold as well.  Brian.  Good evening.  Hello.  Hi.  I'm an attorney.  I know these guys not personally, but their reputations, Tommy Mallon and Ron Sage, are stellar.  And they're well-liked by cops, and they're well-liked by the bar.  And, I mean, I wish I had the case, Ron. 
[02:53:00]  But there's no way this kid did anything wrong.  I saw the video already, and this is really, sometimes you get cops that do the wrong thing, and that's all there is to it.  Thanks, brother.  I'm not just going to, you know, blindly.  All right.  We're losing you.  Mike in Orlando.  Mike.  My support.  Wrapping up with these guys, but everyone wants this.  Mike?  Hey, I just wanted to know, Ron there.  Once these tapes of the show were revealed, what an ass you are.  Do you think of your future is a Wayne Newton impersonator? 
[02:53:30]  I come across.  I hear it a little bit.  A little Wayne Newton.  Quite the queerish Wayne Newton.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  You must have the wrong number, asshole.  No, no.  I have the right number, asshole.  Oh.  Wow.  All right.  You got anything else to say?  Did you see the tape here, son?  Did you see the tape?  I don't need to see the tape to know that you're an asshole.  Okay.  But did you see the tape of the incident?  Did you see the tape of the incident?  Or do you just want to call in because your wife wouldn't suck your dick this morning? 
[02:54:00]  Oh.  I wonder why you don't work with Ron anymore.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Is that the problem, pal?  You couldn't get it up this morning, so now you're going to take it out to people on  the phone you haven't seen or heard from, haven't even seen a tape, don't know what  the hell you're talking about?  Huh?  What is it, pal?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Go see a good urologist.  Now, shut the fuck up.  I'm free with you. 
[02:54:30]  I don't like the fact that people are giving Ron a hard time.  I know.  The fact that he sounds like Gomez Adams when he talks should not affect people's phone calls.  I love him.  All right.  And I'm surprised why Tom decided to go out on his own.  I know.  It was safer that way, right, Tom?  Tom is saying they have to wrap up shortly, I guess, because they have to lose.  Well, he doesn't want Ron to blow the case.  Yes.  Well, look, man.  I don't know.  I don't know what we accomplished.  I know we did some flying radio for everybody. 
[02:55:00]  We got...  I met my new lawyer.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I need a card.  Yeah.  No, we got their side of the story out, obviously.  And, you know, I was a little more on the cop's side before you came in.  Tell you the truth.  I thought you were pulling away a little too much and resisting, but listening to your side  and laughing my ass off at your lawyer, I've turned around a bit.  And after hearing the audio, the way the cop got out of the car, that was looking at  the confrontation.  That was like very...  Yeah, because that was instant confrontation that he had on his mind. 
[02:55:30]  So, no, great to have you guys in.  Thanks for coming in.  You're a pisser.  Could Ron the lawyer come back on our show someday?  Yeah, you know what I mean?  To talk about all this shit?  Lawyer segment.  So, Dan, look at him.  I'm Ron.  I'm Ron the lawyer.  Okay.  Love you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to continue with Russell Peters in the studio.  Thanks, Ron.  Appreciate it, brother.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  All right.  Nice meeting you, man.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Opie and Anthony in studio.  Russell Peters. 
[02:56:00]  Actually, Russell Peters was in for that whole thing with Ron the lawyer.  But, well, none of us really got to talk.  Not that we think about it.  He was awesome.  Did you like that lawyer?  I would love him to open for me this weekend.  He was very entertaining, right?  He should do stand-up, but he'd be a very aggressive stand-up.  We're going to have him on this show as a regular.  We have to.  Such an irony.  We have to.  Because we have always said lawyers suck on the radio.  Lawyers equal not funny under any circumstance. 
[02:56:30]  And we heard he was bringing his lawyer in.  We're like, oh, great.  Here comes the comedy.  And the lawyer is the funniest motherfucker.  He was the funniest guy in the room for that segment.  What an ass.  We were about ready to say, make sure the lawyer stays outside the studio.  Boy, that would have been a major mistake.  Mistake right there.  Yeah.  Good.  Great taste the lawyer has in comedy, too.  Oh?  Does he like Jim Norton?  Oh, he actually does.  Oh, really?  I did hear him say big fan.  Yeah.  Wow.  He likes me more than Joe DeRosa, Bill Burr, and Bob Kelly do. 
[02:57:00]  Well, that's obvious if they don't cast you on the producer.  Bill Burr was on the hotline during that.  We just couldn't go to him.  There was too much going on.  And the other thing, really fast.  We're on the lawyer.  I'm thinking, and I think Bobby thought this, too, that he had really nice hair for an older  gentleman.  He has a horrible wig.  Boy, did we miss this one, Bobby.  Russell Peters and Jimmy are like, are you fucking kidding?  That was a fucking...  Jimmy said he had a nail in it.  Killed me, man.  Oh, my God, damn, the guy's got a good head of hair. 
[02:57:30]  I tweeted a picture of him.  He looked like R. Lee Armie a little bit.  Yes.  He reminded me of a little gunner sergeant.  I thought he looked like David Carradine a little bit.  I don't know.  He looked half Asian with blue eyes and a toupee.  And the father looked like Roger Daltrey.  Yeah, the father definitely did.  A Roger Daltrey now look, you know, with a great white hair, curly.  It was too inside, but I wrote out Gary Wall, too.  Oh, he kind of had Gary Wall.  The ice cream PD.  Why we didn't videotape that is a terrible...  Fuck, I almost said a sin like my aunt. 
[02:58:00]  Because it was fun to watch...  Ron was kind of like leaning down, just talking, like looking at the floor with his hand on his forehead.  Just fucking...  That would have said his toupee didn't fall off.  He was holding it on.  Just concentrating on the call.  It was fun to watch the dad, Tom, just kind of tapping him like...  You know?  He's got this loose cat.  He's probably a smart lawyer, though.  The kid seemed nervous, though, didn't he?  He had pasties in his mouth.  He could hear it.  Who, Ron?  No, the kid, the kid that...  The kid?  Yeah, he was driving.  Because he was lying. 
[02:58:30]  He's not used to being on the radio or TV.  The kid was drunk.  Come on.  Come on.  He's not a kid, Opie.  He's not a fucking kid.  Yeah, that was funny.  The callers were just fucking...  The callers were funny.  Brutal.  Hey, Russell, you box.  I used to.  You know what you told me you used to box with Lennox Lewis?  Lennox and I were amateurs at the same time.  No.  Really?  Fuck.  I started in 85 and stopped in 94.  So you really can fight.  Well, I mean, I kind of really stopped around 1989, but I just went to the gym a whole lot  less for the next five years. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, huh?  Did you ever spy with Lennox?  No.  No.  Lennox was in a different city, but we would see each other at tournaments and stuff.  Do you know him?  Yeah.  I know him very well.  You're still boxed?  I know his mom, his brothers.  Do you ever knock somebody out?  I have done, yes.  Do you ever get knocked out?  Only in the ring I've been staggered a little bit.  Really?  I've been hit on the head with a baseball bat outside the ring.  Jesus Christ.  Why?  We're talking 22 years ago, but you know.  For what?  In my rambunctious teenage years.  Well, fuck it.  We're on the lawyer, man.  There's some money there.  I know.  Who hit you?  Hey, character, did you hit him with a bat? 
[02:59:30]  Look at the video.  Did you see the video?  Did you see the video?  What do you do for a living, you cunt?  It's your honor.  You've knocked people out on the street?  Yeah, yeah.  Street fighting kind of shit?  Just cracking the...  Yeah, yeah.  Not in a long...  I've done a little jiu-jitsu, too, so I...  Fuck.  The past few knockouts have been more choke-outs than knockouts, but yeah.  That's how it goes.  What are you...  You're a Toronto guy, right?  Yes, sir.  And are you a big MMA fan? 
[03:00:00]  I am.  I am.  Well, I'm more boxing first, but then MMA.  What happened with Pacquiao and...  We were supposed to...  We were trying to get Pacquiao and...  Mayweather?  Mayweather in, and then...  Why did that fight happen?  That fight came together way too easy, didn't it?  Like, it was just like...  Everybody was like, hey, this should be the great fight.  And then they were like, March 13th, everyone was like, oh, what the fuck?  It's kind of like a girl giving you pussy too easy.  Right.  You're like, wait a minute, what's wrong with this?  Yeah.  What's the problem here?  So then they created some problems, and they've set up other fights to build the hype a little  bit more, and then it'll happen later on this year.  Oh, all right, okay.  They can milk it a little bit. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, I think that's what they should have done too, so they created this little controversy  to make it look like a real hate match now, and it'll create more pay-per-view buys in  the long run, I think.  That's a guy who can follow it.  I was just going to quickly say, boxing seems to be in trouble though.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  I think MMA's going to burn itself out, because it's way too accessible right now.  Yeah, it's very readily available, and it's on TV every night now.  And eventually, people are just going to be like, eh, give me something else.  You know, at least that's the first time I've ever heard a point that actually makes sense, 
[03:01:00]  because boxing, you don't watch boxing every night.  You wait until there's an event, then you watch it, fight.  This is like every night you can turn in a lot of stuff.  Yeah, but when you watch the events, the big events in boxing stink.  It's fucking stink.  Yeah, but the fighters still make way more money.  Yeah, but you wait, you wait, you wait, and then all of a sudden you see the fight,  and it fucking blows.  Well, you're just used to a different pace now with the MMA.  And there's no heavyweights.  There's no exciting heavyweights whatsoever.  Well, there's no heavyweights.  Why don't you fucking join?  You know what I mean?  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Brousers. 
[03:01:30]  What did you say?  I said, why don't you put Jimmy in the movie, you fuck?  No, I don't hear what you're saying.  I tell you, you fucking cunt.  I'm a good actor.  Fucking dirty racist.  He's doing a movie.  It's not a movie.  It's a short independent film.  Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, and Joe DeRosa.  Who's more short and independent than Norton?  Exactly.  You're in the movie, kid.  You're right.  I didn't get that.  Bobby, Joe DeRosa, and Bill Burr, alleged friends of mine.  We're doing a short film in New York. 
[03:02:00]  I love you.  And I put myself up to be in it, Bobby.  Do you want to be in the movie?  Yeah, can I be in the movie?  Absolutely, dude.  I could be the brown guy.  Fuck as he's in, sorry.  Dude, I'd fire Voss today for you.  I'm kidding.  You can't fire a Jew.  Are you crazy?  See, I want to actually know more about Russell, because you guys are saying he's like one  of the biggest comics in the world.  Russell sells out fucking everywhere.  And it's like Dane Cook sellouts, right?  But Russell came out of...  Like just the big fucking arenas.  I mean, Russell, yeah, he came out of nowhere.  But you're from Canada. 
[03:02:30]  Huge in Canada.  Huge in Asia.  Now you're huge in America.  I mean, you're worldwide.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  In Africa?  Yeah.  Who the fuck sees you in Africa?  It's so funny.  We keep getting these requests from Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya and Tanzania, like all over  Africa.  It's like, when are you coming?  We love you on the YouTube.  I'm like, you know, they have dial-up.  Come here and we have $10 million waiting for you.  You give us your bank account number.  It's almost like the Al-Qaeda's following me. 
[03:03:00]  We love you in the cave.  He's going to be performing on the back of a fucking flatbed truck with a mounted gun in  it.  He's going to get paid in fucking, like, gold teeth and diamonds.  He's going to knock the teeth out in front of me.  This one.  You like this one?  You like molar?  Are you just flying from country to country every weekend?  Or are you trying to, like, all right, I'll stay in the States for a little bit?  I'll stay in the States as much as possible.  I'm trying to get, like, movies and fucking TV, but that's not happening.  So I just got to go out there and chase paper. 
[03:03:30]  You can make your own movie.  I could, but I don't have any good ideas.  That pretty much is the thing to make in a movie.  Neither did me and Billy or Joe DeRosa.  Just make it.  Speaking of which, we've got Bill Burr on the phone here.  Bill's in Tampa this weekend.  Is he?  Bill.  In Tampa.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Bill.  Hey, Billy.  Hello, Bill.  Yes, I got word that Bobby Kelly is throwing our wonderful director under the bus on your  great program.  Yes.  Completely throwing both of you is pretty much under the bus. 
[03:04:00]  Not Billy.  Me and Billy are producers.  You said Billy is pretty much like, I don't know.  I don't care.  Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.  So when Jim Norton, I found out that little Jimmy Norton was not going to be part of this  project and wasn't even asked.  I wanted to know from Bobby why and what had happened.  Was there any dialogue that included Jimmy?  And he said, Joe DeRosa's fault.  Pretty much just.  That's not what I said.  You threw DeRosa under the bus.  Be specific.  What you have to understand about Bobby. 
[03:04:30]  Bobby Kelly is a survivor.  Thank you.  He's a cockroach.  He looked at the odds in there and he's just like, well, I'm not taking the hit.  I'll just dump it on DeRosa.  He went on for.  Yeah.  He was in Los Angeles during all of this.  So I missed.  All I have right now is I'm actually a messenger here bringing the official statement from Joe DeRosa.  Oh, is this the official?  Yeah, well, we gave out his Twitter account, so I guess he found out that he was a scumbag  for not putting Jimmy in the movie.  Joe DeRosa is on set right now, so he had me come down here. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, Christ.  Basically, he said the reason why Jim Norton is not in the movie is because he asked about  him to Bobby and Bobby said, dude, fucking Norton's not going to do it if he doesn't have  a bunch of lines, dude.  Don't waste his fucking time.  Oh, Bobby goes back to Bobby.  All right.  Let's get it back.  Hang on.  You're saying that what Bobby is saying then is that Jimmy is incapable of improvisation. 
[03:05:30]  No, no, no, no.  And just taking account.  What's going on?  Like what I stated before is Bobby Kelly's a survivor.  And the second Jim Norton, I mean, Joe DeRosa brought up having the wonderfully talented  Jim Norton in the movie, he was like, there's no way I'm going to be sitting across such  a dynamic stage presence as Jim Norton.  He cuts his legs out there, and then he goes on the radio, and then he cuts DeRosa's.  A-Train 11 hit it right on the head.  Bobby equals Jay Leno. 
[03:06:00]  See what you're doing?  Apparently Bill's a survivor, too.  This is a fucking great...  Yeah, I think Jim Norton's a really talented guy.  He just wasn't getting the ratings.  Oh, so, okay.  It's back on Bobby.  Doorman hat and coat yet?  We're going to need it at like 12.  Yeah, it's 10-15.  The doorman.  That would be Rich Voss playing the doorman, right?  Yeah, Rich Voss.  Rich Voss would be a good doorman.  What we're dealing with here is it's nobody's fault.  It's really a budget thing.  All we can afford is guys like Rich Voss for free and Bobby to work for free. 
[03:06:30]  That's what's really going on here.  There's no reason to trash people there, Bobby.  What are you doing?  We're trying to get good press here.  It's true, Bob.  I didn't say anything.  Way to go, Bob.  I was just trying to...  I said Joe's doing a great job.  I said Joe's doing a great...  He's doing a fantastic job, surprisingly.  Bobby Kelly is a cancer on the set of a movie.  I would just say he's a polyp.  Do it in 3-D.  It'll fucking be huge.  It is in 3-D.  Oh, yeah?  No.  In Amateur 3-D.  Plus his teeth would scare everybody in 3-D. 
[03:07:00]  What if one of us is lines?  What if one of us is lines?  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.  I have no idea.  Oh, stop.  You do.  You're the producer.  He plays an annoying doorman.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  He says, I'll get that for you.  There's very minimal lines.  I'll get that for you.  What, you think I couldn't do that?  I'll for that get you.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  If you're going to be in a movie, you're going to be in a movie.  I have one line in every...  I'm a one-and-done guy.  Yeah.  It's in my contract.  I can do nothing that will get me recognition or further my career. 
[03:07:30]  One line in Spider-Man.  One line in Zack and Miri.  And three or four or maybe five lines in Cop Out.  I thought you co-starred in Spider-Man.  No.  I actually was the Lynchpin.  Bobby, why didn't you want Jim in the movie?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, what is your beef with Jim?  Now it's on you again.  I didn't...  I...  Yeah, listen.  There you go.  Wait, listen.  Listen to his fucking creepy evil laugh.  Did you put Dane in the movie?  He put you in the movie?  Yeah, and then he cut me right out of it.  I don't think DeRosa wanted me in either, though.  DeRosa never liked me, no. 
[03:08:00]  It had nothing to do with that.  I think that at the beginning of this movie, we couldn't...  It was literally like nothing in there for him.  What's there, nothing in there for him?  There's nothing in there for him?  What are you going to do?  Give him one fucking thing and be nothing?  Like our background player?  Be a friend, at least.  Be a boy.  Is he going to sit in the background?  It's New York.  I could sell peanuts in the movie.  Fucking Voss Louie beans.  You've seen him act.  It's horrible.  Well, I couldn't be there while you guys were talking one time.  and do one or two lines and then get out.  Yeah.  Like when I walk out, the audience applauds.  Like when fucking Tim Conway would walk out on Marriage House. 
[03:08:30]  Yes, exactly.  I say, Billy, I say we actually put Norton in something.  No, I wouldn't do it now.  My feelings are very hurt.  Billy, would you...  He's a sensitive man.  What do you say, Billy?  I feel terrible that we've somehow ruined our relationship with Jim Norton.  Jim, this is...  I swear to God, there's like five parts of this.  I know.  Yeah, well, four.  I don't think we should put people in Jim.  Why don't we just fire Voss today?  I mean, it's showbiz, dude.  We fire him and we throw Norton in. 
[03:09:00]  But Jimmy ain't...  No, Jimmy ain't taking...  What are you, his agent?  Let me talk to the fucking client.  Fire Voss and hire Bonnie.  He might do it just to see Voss get fired, Anthony.  All right, now you made a good point.  Now we had some controversy to the film.  Now we're putting it on Voss.  No, I'd actually like to see Norton play more than Voss.  It'd be a fucking way better hit.  Remember, more people would fucking want to see this movie?  I know.  How do you not want a built-in guy like Jim Norton, who has a built-in audience here on 
[03:09:30]  this program, talk about the film and everything?  It even makes bad business sense.  Never mind fucking a friend over.  I didn't fuck my friend over.  Let's not downsell Last Comic Standing here.  That's what you said.  That's how you put it.  I didn't put it that way.  I knew that.  Oh, you're the worst.  I can't stand here.  DeRose has always been very anti-Jim Norton.  No, he loves you.  No, he doesn't.  Jim, what really happened is we had too much respect for you.  No.  That's true.  No, because he has to tell. 
[03:10:00]  Jim, we weren't going to come to you and go, can you do half a line?  That's going to take, you know, an hour and a half to shoot because we're trying to be  all artsy-fartsy with the angles of the camera.  You know, you're a busy man.  It really had nothing to do with that.  He's exactly right.  I would have been honored to do something with my friend.  I said that to Opie.  It's you just want to be asked to be in it and then turn it down.  Sometimes.  And then turn it down.  I don't get asked.  It's like.  Yeah, you didn't get asked.  I don't get asked anything ever. 
[03:10:30]  Exactly.  I don't even get phone calls from you, Robert.  I call you all the time, dude.  Dude.  Jesus.  Guy lives in L.A. for a month and he's duding me.  No, I've been duding my whole fucking life.  Apparently you don't know me on the radio.  You know what, dude?  So what?  Russell sells out everywhere, dude.  I got my friends, dude.  I got my family.  People love me.  That's fine.  But, yeah, he's absolutely right.  I really feel bad, though.  No, why should I do?  I can't do.  Wait, more importantly, if Bill Burr's in New York, why isn't he doing our show? 
[03:11:00]  Because I'm actually doing my job as a producer on this, making sure that the road isn't fucking  up.  Billy, when are you going to Tampa?  I fly to Tampa on Thursday.  I just did it.  We got it ready.  Yeah, you know what?  I just found out that they're actually having their version of Mardi Gras that week right  outside of the club.  Oh, yeah.  It's really ghetto there, buddy.  It's ghetto.  The cops wear just the badge at night. 
[03:11:30]  Jeans and just the badge.  I'm not like it's fucking Miami Vice.  It's pretty bad.  Yeah.  It's really bad.  Sorry.  I'm dealing with like nine million people coming in and out of my building.  I just wanted to call up because I know Bob's not exactly the greatest delegate to send  out to your show.  But Jim, yeah, I'm actually flattered that you'd even want to be in it.  But, you know, we just didn't want to waste your time, dude, having you come over there  doing a line and a half, like I said, that was going to take an hour and a half to shoot.  You know, I mean, you were in Spider-Man, for Christ's sake. 
[03:12:00]  You're not going to do our little shit movie.  I certainly would with my friends who I like to be a part of creatively.  You'd certainly do your shit movie.  I certainly would.  I would have.  Your scat film.  Exactly.  I'd be happy to at least clean off the glass coffee table in between shoots and fucking  diuretics.  How great would it be if they're actually filming a snuff film?  Voss is the star.  I have no idea yet.  Well, I think then Jim could actually truly be offended if we wouldn't invite him to come  down to participate in a snuff film. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Ferrer.  Well, I'll see it like everybody else at the festivals or the parties.  Yeah.  The parties.  All right, Billy, I'll be over in a little while with the hat and coat.  Cool.  Yeah.  Don't say it like it isn't important, Bob.  No, I'm fucking, I'm on it.  All we have is Rich Voss standing there looking stupid.  That's what we have anyways with a hat and coat.  You're the producer.  All right, Bill Burr.  Take it in your mouth, Bill Burr.  There he goes.  Always good to hear from Bill Burr.  By the way, Russell Peters will be at the Radio City Music Hall Friday, Saturday. 
[03:13:00]  I don't think you need our help.  You're just here to say hi, really, right?  Here to say hi.  Sold out shows, I hear.  Yeah, they're good.  Well, we're hoping they're going to be good.  Last time I came in, you guys had the naked girls with their asses out.  That was a great show.  Hi, wow.  How the hell was that?  That was a year ago.  What year were you here?  That was two years ago.  No shit, three years ago.  What are we in?  Things have changed.  Two years ago, two years ago.  They have thin, fat lawyers with wigs.  Yeah, now that's all we can get.  He was great, though. 
[03:13:30]  He was phenomenal.  I love him.  Ron, he's my fucking favorite.  Ron.  Russell, favorite place in the world with all the traveling you do?  Well, I don't really have one anymore.  Really?  I mean, I used to be Durban, South Africa.  That was always my favorite hideaway.  Why that place?  That was the first place I was ever famous.  Oh, okay.  It was like around 2001, 2002.  What a weird first place to be famous.  Yeah, they had billboards of me up over there and had to change my name in the hotel and 
[03:14:00]  stuff like that.  Did you fill out a lot of chicks?  I was getting a lot of chicks back then.  I literally clipped three brand new ones a day.  Literally, like breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  One was the hotel guest services manager.  She came up at nine.  She said, should I bring you some coffee?  I was like, that would be great.  Wow.  And we had coffee and cock.  You had coffee, she had cock.  I just want to clear that up.  Yes. 
[03:14:30]  But you both had cream.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, who's the saucy one on my left?  So how about England?  Do you do well in England?  I do.  Last year, I set the record for highest attendance for a single standard performance in UK history.  Jesus Christ.  I did the O2 Arena where Michael Jackson was supposed to perform.  How many people was that?  16,500.  Jesus Christ.  I did bananas last weekend in Hasbrox Heights.  How'd that go?  It was almost full.  I hate it when you brag.  Yes.  We have no bananas.  They didn't even give me ripe bananas. 
[03:15:00]  No, they were ripe.  They were green bananas.  Did you do well?  The shows are great.  Yeah.  A lot of fans came out.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  It was a good time, but not that shit.  You've done those venues, though.  It's not like you don't know what it feels like.  Yeah, I do.  You've done them.  You've done them, kid.  Done what venues?  Big venues.  Yeah, they didn't know I was coming.  It doesn't matter.  You were still on.  You know what it feels like.  I could have not went out and nobody would have said anything.  I could have every show five minutes before I was supposed to go, I'd go, I'm not going 
[03:15:30]  to do this, and nothing would have happened.  No one would be disappointed?  Nope.  They could have brought out fucking anybody, and they'd be like, who's this?  So, Russell has a lot of rappers that go to his show.  I'm actually jealous.  He's friends at Melly Mel.  That's kind of cool.  We should call Mel right now.  I wouldn't know what to say to him.  What would we say to Melly Mel?  He just gave us voicemail.  So, you reach, sometimes, he has two phones.  One of them is a, the voicemail just comes on, and it'll be like, muscles, baby, muscles.  What the fuck?  Because that's what he calls himself now. 
[03:16:00]  He calls himself Muscle Simmons.  You can't call yourself Muscle.  Yeah, it's got to be anything.  Because he is, he's fucking, he's like 50 years old, and he's diesel.  But now his other one, he's rapping on the other voicemail.  Jesus.  You did a crib, MTV Cribs, right?  I did.  I'm doing it again next month.  I'm doing my new house in LA, and my Vegas house.  Yeah, how many houses do you have?  Must be a small house.  I have five.  You have five houses?  Yes.  Where are they?  Thank you, market.  Where are all the houses?  Two in Toronto, two in LA, and one in Vegas.  Oh, okay.  The reason I have two in LA is because the market's so shit, I can't dump the other one. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  So I got renters in there now.  What about, you've gone to Dubai, right?  Yeah.  I kind of, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of obsessed with the, uh, the Dubai Burge, the new tower.  Right.  Um, what is it like there?  How expensive is it to go to Dubai?  Can I check the Emirates there?  I, I was going.  Pricey.  It's only 1,400 bucks.  To go first class to Dubai?  Oh, first class.  First class.  $17,000.  Yeah, that's the, I had that, I've flown that.  The, uh, the private suite?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've done that.  And it has a shower on board, too.  $17,000.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't some prince a big fan of yours? 
[03:17:00]  There's some fucking.  The king, the king of Jordan, when I was there last, in Jordan last month, I, uh, the king  of Jordan invited me over.  How the fuck does that happen?  He's a fan.  Jesus.  So he invited me over and me and Gabriel Iglesias went.  Me, Gabriel, Angelo Sirucas, uh, Larry Omaha, my brother, my sister-in-law, and, uh, Gabriel's  girlfriend.  We all went over to the king's palace and he cooked us Kobe beef.  Wow.  Like, he literally cooked it for us right in front of us.  He had, like, a little teppanyaki grill and, and he, and then he got us hammered and then 
[03:17:30]  he told us to call him Ab.  Oh, no way.  Because his name's Abdullah.  Jesus.  He's like, he goes, by the way, my friends call me Ab.  And by the way, he went to school in Boston, Bobby.  So he has, like, this, he has an American accent.  Really?  Did he give you any gold or money?  No, he gave me a watch.  He gave me a watch.  And I'm looking at, uh, Anthony's watch and it looks similar.  Is that Special Ops, that watch or something?  It is a Special Ops watch.  Yeah, he gave me a Special Ops watch.  Damn, look at you.  So you hung out with the king of Jordan?  Yeah, and then, so he gets, he feeds us, gets us drunk, and then he goes, do you guys 
[03:18:00]  like to fire guns?  Wow, this guy is.  And we're like, who doesn't like to fire guns?  You sure wasn't Anthony?  You weren't hanging out loud?  This is my long lost dad.  He has a range in his, uh, in the palace.  So we went into the gun range.  Every gun you could imagine.  Jesus, that sounds fantastic.  Automatic weapons.  And so he goes, here, first we'll fire it in, like, single mode.  And then, as we're firing, he clicks it and, like, drrrr.  And he had a sawed-off shotgun.  I go, what's this for?  In case you bump into a 7-Eleven late at night? 
[03:18:30]  And he had everything.  You could have just killed him right there.  I was thinking that, too.  I was thinking that, and I'm like...  I just assassinated him.  Yeah, that would have been real...  Wow.  We were thinking about it, because there was no security around us.  We're like, this has got to be some sort of weird security breach.  Yeah.  But he was cool as shit, so...  You'd probably get the barrel just to him, and then just be Swiss cheese in two seconds  with these hidden guns somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  Where is Jordan?  Between what and what?  It's next door to Palestine and Israel. 
[03:19:00]  You'll stay in the front.  And it's sandwiched between Palestine, Israel, Kuwait, and Iraq.  So the neighbors weren't complaining about the gunfire.  They didn't even notice.  It's so loud over there.  What the hell is going on?  Do you hear the mosquitoes?  I'm going to Dubai in February, if you want to go.  I do want to go there.  I want to go to the...  How is it...  What did you stay?  You didn't stay in the new tower.  I want to stay in that hotel.  No.  I never stayed.  It's...  I haven't been there yet.  How expensive do you think the hotel is in the big building?  Fucking expensive.  It is, right?  They have that one other hotel, the Jameera Beach one, really expensive, the seven star. 
[03:19:30]  Does it look like a fucking...  Yeah, the sale?  Yes.  Yeah.  You have to pay an entrance fee just to go look at it.  Wow.  Because it's that...  And it's gross and opulent.  What's a seven star?  I don't know.  I think somebody jerks you off to get you to sleep.  How much a night for that?  I don't know.  It's too fucking expensive.  I wouldn't even consider it.  But wouldn't they put you up there if you were doing a gig?  No, they put me up in some other Jameera, Medina, some shit. 
[03:20:00]  It's nice, but you couldn't bring chicks back to your room late at night because apparently  some Russian mafia shit happened there and they whacked somebody in the gym.  Wow.  Yeah.  So what they did was they had hookers go in with him and then the hookers let the mafia  guys in and they shot the guy who chopped them up or something.  Jesus.  There was obviously other issues there.  Yeah, yeah.  So I met a chick out there and she wasn't a hooker. 
[03:20:30]  She was just a chick and they were like, she can't go back to your room.  And I go, well, I'm not going to fuck her in the lobby unless you want me to.  And so I complained to the manager and they were like, oh, sorry, sir.  We know it's a rule for everybody.  You're okay.  And thank God the guy, like everybody's fucking Indian there.  So I was okay.  Security guy was Indian.  I said some shit to him and Indian was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And he was like, okay.  And then.  Wow.  So you think that, that, that seven star hotel.  I mean, it's nice, but it's, I don't think it's worth the trip unless you're working. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  Okay.  And I'm glad you said that.  What, to Dubai?  Yeah.  I, again, cause I, right now they're economically getting their balls kicked in.  So I'm like, you might be able to get pretty good deals and it's the world.  You can fly Emirates, not first class and it's fine.  It's, it's really nice.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  If you have too much of a layover on Emirates air, they give you a car and put you up in  a hotel.  Like you call up and they're like, you have a car waiting for you at the airport and they  put you up in a hotel.  Dynamite in the trunk.  You pull up to the hotel.  It explodes. 
[03:21:30]  It's not that bad there.  So business is probably nicer than Emirates, right?  It's a flat bed in business.  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  First class is a suite.  And it's with continental.  It has a door.  Your room.  You have a room.  You have a room on the plane.  It's like around a ship.  Wow.  It really is.  And it gives you a 27 inch TV in front of you.  How, how, how's big is the, is the business one's pleasant though?  Yeah.  The business one is like a first class on somebody else's.  How much of business do you think?  Uh, probably around, probably, probably around five or six grand.  Maybe more. 
[03:22:00]  Five or six grand.  It's going to go in style.  1400 bucks.  Coach.  What's Coach?  It's a long flight to go Coach.  Yeah.  It's not that long.  And, and they have TV and everything.  And you've got those crazy long legs.  You can buy two seats in Coach.  You'd be fine.  2,800 bucks.  I might as well just go first class for 17,000.  I'm going to shit when I saw that.  Wow.  It was great.  But it's really good.  Well, we had the promoters pay that one.  Business sounds fine.  For five grand, you could stretch out.  I mean, I'm saying five grand.  It's probably more, but I'm just saying.  Oh, okay.  That's five grand.  You know, you know, the certain flights from American Airlines and United Airlines to LA 
[03:22:30]  are five grand?  Jesus.  Round trip?  They are.  It's retarded.  They have flat seats almost, but it's a lot of fuck.  I was flying Virgin America now.  38 inches.  It's actually $50.  Virgin America.  I flew Virgin America.  They're a cool airline, man.  It's got the purple light in it.  The only problem, the planes are fucking dirty.  They have Wi-Fi, though.  I know they do, but they're not washed well.  I didn't like it.  There was like fucking nasty crumbs on my foot.  It's almost like they're fucking in a rush to turn the plane around, and they're not  staffed properly.  That was a big, big fucking thing with me. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, my God, man.  Did they have the bed, though?  In first class?  No, it's not live flash.  It's very comfortable.  Flattish, yeah.  Comfortable, but it's white leather, which looks dirty.  They got movies.  The cleanliness of the plane.  Great movies.  A lot of good movies.  Maybe he just had a bad cleaning day.  What's Patrice doing on TV back then?  Whoa.  It looks like a gentlemanly Patrice.  That's the star from Precious.  We sort of do the same joke with other things.  Yeah, we do.  Hey, let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.  We got Russell Peters in studio.  Sean. 
[03:23:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, Sean.  Hey, Sean.  Russell, I think I know who you're talking about with the Sultan or Prince or whatever  his name is.  King Abdullah?  Whatever his name is.  I think I met him freshman year at Bentley.  He was supposed to live with one of my buddies I grew up with, but when he walked into the  dormitory, it was not worthy of a Sultan or whatever you want to call him, so he went  downtown Boston and bought a multi-million dollar home just for the semester or for two 
[03:24:00]  semesters or whatever it was.  And then when he went to buy his transportation, he went out and got a S500, bulletproofed the  shit out of it, cameras, everything, all that.  And then when it started snowing in Boston, he asked my buddy what he needs for a car, and  he's like, oh, you know, something, four-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, whatever.  So he goes out, buys a 911, bulletproofed the shit out of that, drove it twice, and then  sold it to one of our buddies for $1. 
[03:24:30]  No.  I mean...  Wait, how old are you?  Uh, 30.  Oh, that's not him, because he's 48.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think you might have missed him.  Maybe it was his son?  I'll tell you what, he's not that guy.  He wouldn't do that kind of shit.  He's so normal, it freaked me out.  Yeah.  Like, he's so normal that you forget he's a king when you're hanging out with him, until  he said, what time's your flight in the morning?  And I go, 10.30.  I said, I'll probably leave the hotel at 7.30.  And he goes, oh, that's too early.  I'll call the airport.  You leave at 9.  Yeah, that's...  Wow. 
[03:25:00]  That rocks.  Only the king.  Wait, he was just going to have the airport let you ride through?  Oh, yeah, he did.  We got to the airport, and these dudes met us, took our passports and our bags, and said,  go this way, sir.  And we went up to a VIP room and waited.  And that was it.  Wow.  Here, you want the best shit?  Here's what happened.  Because we were hanging out.  Here, this is the truth.  This is the truth.  I can't believe this.  So we're in the VIP room.  We'd hung out with the king the night before, ate his food, drank his liquor, fired his guns,  cool as shit, made jokes with him, cracked jokes with him.  He was telling us stories about George Bush and stuff, about how George Bush was actually 
[03:25:30]  a really nice guy.  And he goes, you know, George is a very nice man, and he's very funny, and he's a really  cool guy to hang out with.  He's just not smart enough to run a country.  And so, we're taking all this information in, and then the next morning, we get to the  airport, and they let us in.  We're sitting in this VIP room.  We're all looking at each other like, did we really just hang out with the king last  night?  It's about 10 to 10.  Now, our flight's at 10.30.  An angry-looking Arab guy walks into the room holding a passport and goes, those are 
[03:26:00]  beaters?  And I'm like, that's me.  I'm feeling cocky as shit because I hung out with the king.  He goes, that's me.  He goes, come with me.  And I go, nope.  And he looks at me very seriously and goes,  come with me.  And I'm like, shit, okay.  Where's your bag?  I go, right here.  You have two cell phones.  Give me them.  I go, how the fuck does this guy know I have two cell phones?  And he snatches my cell phone out of my hand, and he's leading me out of the room, and  I'm looking at my friends, and I'm looking at Gabriel and Angela.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  We don't know.  Leads me down the stairs to a hallway where there's two armed guards with Uzis pointed 
[03:26:30]  directly at me.  And I'm like, my ego kicks in and goes, holy shit, the king's coming to say bye to me.  That's what I'm thinking.  This is incredible.  So he walks me into this room, and the guys with the Uzis, they're pointing them at  me the whole time.  So he sits me down in this room, and one guy has a gun.  He's standing at the door with a gun pointed at my head, aimed at my head.  And the other guy has the gun pointed down the hallway like they're expecting somebody  to try and assassinate me, if these guys don't. 
[03:27:00]  So the guy's like, where were you last night?  I'm like, I did a show, and then I went to the palace.  Why did you go to the palace?  Because I was invited by who?  I'm like, the king.  Which king?  I'm like, what do you mean, which?  The fucking Don King invited me.  I go, the king.  Which king?  And I go, the guy behind you, because there's a picture of him right there.  I go, that king.  He goes, my king.  I go, yeah, your king.  Why did my king invite you?  I'm like, I don't know why your king invited me.  He's my friend.  I'm acting like he's my friend now. 
[03:27:30]  And he's going to be pissed off when he finds us.  He's mad since this guy lights up a cigarette, and he's like, huh.  And then I hear commotion in the hallway, and a lot of Arabic being spoken.  I'm like, blah, blah, blah, blah, and this guy.  And I hear, hey, bro.  Hey, I'm like, hey, fool, don't fucking point the gun at me.  And it's Gabriel.  And Gabriel Iglesias walks in the room, and he's on the phone.  And I go, Gabe, what the fuck's going on?  And he goes, here.  And he passes me the phone.  And I go, hello.  And it's the king.  And he goes, never be the first to leave a party again.  You just got punked, biatch.  Holy shit. 
[03:28:00]  It was worth it just to have the king call you biatch.  That is.  And then he goes, were you scared?  And I go, nah, there's a little Hershey's Kissing underwear.  But other than that, I'm okay.  Holy shit.  My tits were sweating.  Who knew this guy was such a card?  And then Gabriel goes, hey, you're lucky.  That's the one he wanted to do to you.  He was coming up with all kinds of pranks that weren't funny.  And I go, what was the unfunny one?  He goes, he was going to take your luggage and put a bag of white powder and a gun in it.  I go, that's not funny. 
[03:28:30]  So wait, did the guys finally laugh when it was revealed and he called?  Oh, yeah, the guy behind the table looked at me and goes, I'm so sorry, sir.  I'm so sorry, sir.  And then the guys with the Uzi's were like, ha ha, sorry, sorry.  And I'm like, motherfucker, you had a live gun pointed at my head.  That is great.  That is a great story.  God damn.  That's fun, man.  That's fucking, that's great.  Wow.  Isn't the king of Jordan, isn't that where, what's his name is from?  I believe Jordan was, no, Alzarkeli. 
[03:29:00]  Alzarkeli, the one who was beheading everybody, I think, was Jordanian.  Yeah, there's like a lot of militants in Jordan.  Well.  Not the king, but I mean.  Yeah, the king's so normal, it's weird, you know, it's just.  It's so odd, yeah.  But until he pulls some king shit out, like, I'll call the airport.  Not the airline.  Right, right.  The airport.  And then you realize you're flying with Royal Jordanian and he's the royal part.  It's me and the country name.  Have you emailed him since?  No, but actually his best friend is a white guy from Boston. 
[03:29:30]  And honestly, his best friend just looks like a Joe Schmo white guy.  He's wearing a ball cap and, like, sweatpants and a t-shirt.  And I was like, who the fuck is this scrub?  And he's like, oh, yeah, we went to school together.  Yeah, me and Ab went to school together.  We were, yeah, we've been best friends ever since.  And I'm like, so what do you do?  He goes, oh, yeah, I fly back here now and then and hang out with them.  And sometimes I stay at the palace.  Sometimes I stay in a hotel, depending on how long I'm going to be here.  Even a king just wants to fuck around with some friends every so often. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, he really does.  He's just like, I got, you know.  Damn, that's fucked up.  So his friend lives in New York, I think.  He's coming to the show this week on one of them.  I don't know which show, but one of them.  See, that's his life.  Yeah.  Who are my friends?  They don't put me in a 15-minute movie.  His friend plays a fun prank with guns and cocaine at the airport.  You got Yoshi sending you porn.  Exactly.  That's my friend.  Hey, Jim.  Joyce, tell me I'm going to shoot this.  It's trannies.  Thanks, Yoshi.  Hey, Russ. 
[03:30:30]  Jim Norton, say hi.  Oprah Ann, say hi.  Bob Kelce, say hi.  I want to come by and do a five-minute guest spot.  That's Yoshi, all right.  Ant's got guns.  We'll get a prank together with you, Jimmy.  We'll take care of you.  I'll get some gun pranks.  It won't be the same, but we'll try something.  We'll make sure they're unloaded so you don't have a Brandon Lee situation.  Oh, fuck.  Got it, right?  The king is making him Kobe beef.  I go to Anthony's.  I'm like, you got anything?  He's like, there's three Doritos in the bottom of a fucking drawer.  You got the light bologna.  Yeah, he makes me lick pimento off his cock. 
[03:31:00]  I like it.  And that's only because you like pimento.  You know what?  It's not going to get better than that.  We should bail.  Yeah, he's 10 to 30 to wrap it up.  Russell, that's a great story.  Thanks, buddy.  Russell Peters, we don't need to promote the sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall,  but we should brag and say they're sold out for you.  Yeah.  Nokia Theater, is that sold out?  Nokia in L.A.  I don't know if it's sold out.  That's February 6th in L.A., Ticketmaster.com.  And what do you want to promote here?  You're on Twitter.  You're everywhere.  That's it, really.  I don't know.  I'm doing Lopez next week, the show. 
[03:31:30]  Cool.  Well, the real Russell P. on Twitter.  That's right.  I'm going to start following you.  What the fuck?  Thanks, buddy.  If you've got stories like that, I've got to fucking see what you're up to.  And RussellPeters.com.  If you're not doing anything, we're here tomorrow.  You know what?  I love the show, so I'll come in.  Come back tomorrow, man.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah, because every time you show up, we have something else going on.  You're good energy for the show.  Just hang out.  Is it either tits or psychotic lawyers?  It's either tits or wigs.  We'll call it the tits and toupee show. 
[03:32:00]  Bobby, you had no idea it was a wig, right?  Nothing.  No.  I'm bald, so I look at it jealously.  I'm like, well, I wish I had hair like that.  And you could for just ten minutes.  And I just need that in a nail.  You could also put it upside down and serve jelly beans out of it.  Russell's doing Radio City, and I'm doing this weekend.  I'll be at the Virginia Beach Funny Bone.  Nice.  So does that mean you can't stop in this weekend?  Well, it's kind of like Radio City.  Funny Bone.  Yeah, without the whole theater vibe.  You still have 18 shows. 
[03:32:30]  Richmond.  What did I say?  I have to humiliate me.  Richmond.  Richmond, Virginia.  I'll be in Richmond.  What?  Do you have to humiliate me?  What, did he book it?  Thank you, Kenny.  Of course, James.  It was like he had been waiting right outside for me to make an error so he could correct me.  That's what he does.  He's ominous.  Yeah, he really is.  He is just the worst.  I like the Richmond Club.  I love the sound guy there.  I got to officially apologize to Kenny for, you know, having his seat greased up yesterday  as we were having lunch at FH Riley's.  What happened?  What?  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  What did you do?  You know Larry's across the street from FH?  Larry's.  Larry's always in FH.  Larry.  And we usually park there because it's easy instead of getting a meter.  Oh, no.  And we parked it nice, and Larry's like, nah, nah, nah, not good enough.  And he comes out of the garage, and he's all greasy.  You know, he's a mechanic.  And I'm like, I knew right off the bat this isn't good.  Larry should not sit in Kenny's fucking truck.  Sits in his truck.  Fucking parks it differently.  We go and have lunch.  We come back, and sure enough, there's grease all over Kenny's driver's seat. 
[03:33:30]  I'm like, and we all know Kenny is an obsessive truck.  He's crazy with that truck.  He's an OCD neat freak, and I'm like, this is not good.  He goes in and causes a little bit of an issue with Larry, who's sarcastic, right?  Well, help me out here, Kenny, because I didn't hear the conversation with Larry,  but Larry wasn't happy that you had to tell him that he got his grease on your seat.  I brought to his attention very politely that he got grease all over my gray leather seat  in my brand new truck, and not to mention Bob Kelly, who blew smoke in there last week.  Yeah, we're still smelling the smoke, Bobby. 
[03:34:00]  Took a haul outside of the car.  It came in.  Went into the car.  It came in with Bobby.  One smoke.  But we still smell it, and trust me, Kenny's not happy with that.  I don't care.  It's not my fucking thing.  One fucking thing.  It was like half a smoke.  Doesn't matter.  Brand new car, buddy.  Yeah, it doesn't smell new anymore.  Exactly.  There was only one diuretic shit on the dashboard.  So Larry wasn't happy, right, Kenny?  He came out with another greasy rag.  Yeah, to clean it off, Greg.  And he goes, what do you mean?  It wasn't me.  It's a brand new jacket. 
[03:34:30]  The guy's covered in grease.  He was covered in grease.  He just smeared it evenly, so he can't tell anymore.  So I thought that was the end of it, and Kenny picks me up this morning, and I got into  his car, and I went flying forward and fell onto the floor, because he got the whole car,  I think, details on it.  All right, so I was like, look at it.  A leather cleaner.  So I go, Kenny, you fucking, yeah, you really cleaned it after the Larry, and he goes, oh,  yeah, I did as soon as I got home.  G.H., I can't subject you to something that hideous.  Oh, yeah, it's all about G.H.  I think it's about you.  Tell him about the condition of my car when we found it. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  It was parked under a pine tree for a year.  Kenny was having a panic attack when he saw the car.  Turn on the air conditioning.  Pine needles and bees come out.  It was buried with pine cones and pine needles.  We had to shovel it out.  We did shovel it out, and it didn't start.  You know, this is not Kenny's world.  It's my world.  I'm used to this shit.  I don't know.  I don't know any different.  But Kenny was having some fucking panic attacks yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  Poor bastard.  But it's okay.  I'd do anything for you, G.H.  It's amazing.  Hard to follow the King of Jordan story.  I know.  With Kenny had to brush a pine cone off the hood.  Oh, I know.  Well, we constantly try.  They get a tree freshener and open it halfway for his car.  What's that?  I'm not doing it.  I didn't hear it.  You almost got it.  Bobby, what are you promoting?  I'm not an asshole.  Everyone promote it.  What about you?  We're out of here.  I'm promoting a movie.  Oh, fuck the movie.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Russell, we'll see you tomorrow, hopefully.  This is crazy, guys.  Anthony and Anthony. </pre>
