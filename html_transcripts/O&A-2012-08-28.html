<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous anecdote about the building's security guard, quickly transitioning to a discussion about Jimmy's severe sleep apnea.  The hosts and callers offered various solutions and commiserated with Jimmy about his sleep study, BiPAP machine, and the frustration of his condition.  A respiratory therapist and other listeners shared their experiences with sleep apnea, CPAP and BiPAP machines, different sleep schedules (including polyphasic sleep), and the influence of diet and lifestyle on sleep.  The conversation about Jimmy's sleep problems continued throughout the show.

The hosts then reminisced about past Rotgut band gigs, including anecdotes about being paid in cocaine and doing unpaid shows, which led to a discussion about personal drug use and a shared lucid dream involving Joe Rogan. The upcoming Rotgut reunion at KJ Farrell's in Belmore was repeatedly mentioned.

The show shifted to news stories, focusing heavily on Camden, New Jersey's shrinking police force and its dilapidated state, contrasting promotional videos of the city with images of its struggling areas, particularly Admiral Wilson Boulevard.  Listeners called in to describe Camdenâ€™s problems. The hosts also discussed Snooki's new baby, Anthony Jeselnik's Twitter humor, King Diamond's live singing, the 2012 Presidential election (including Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Sarah Palin, and Chris Christie's weight), and Hurricane Isaac's potential impact on New Orleans.

The discussion then moved to a planned luxury tour bus rental for an upcoming road trip, including debates about features and destinations. This transitioned into a bizarre discussion about a giant molasses brain tumor in Missouri, followed by a digression about Amish puppy mills.  The hosts also discussed plans to visit New York City landmarks, an upcoming interview with a Navy SEAL author scheduled for September 11th, and their disappointment with the condition of Ben Franklin's former house in Philadelphia (including a call with a former Philadelphia tour guide explaining its demolition). This led to a sexually explicit discussion about Ben Franklin's alleged sexual exploits and the invention of bifocals.

The show continued with discussions about Scott Weiland's behavior, a listener's experience seeing Stone Temple Pilots, and an email mistakenly dated four years in the past. A humorous, altered version of "Sweet Caroline" was played, followed by sexually suggestive lyrics and jokes about the Kennedy family.  A purported new Bigfoot video and a story about a man who died during a Bigfoot hoax were also discussed. Nicole, a guest in the studio for a considerable portion of the show, engaged in banter with the hosts about her personal life and appearance. Ryan Starr and Brian Starr were mentioned as upcoming guests.

Later in the broadcast, the hosts discussed the competitive nature of dating, with Anthony recounting strategies he used to out-compete his friend Joe Curry, contrasting Joe's shyness with Anthony's success. Their past cigar smoking and poker playing were also mentioned.

Ryan Starr then joined the show in studio, discussing his music video for "Stay A While" (almost two million views), his journey as a musician, including a past Tonight Show appearance, and funding the video through personal savings and favors. He performed "Brand New Day" and a cover of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes."  The conversation touched on his upcoming Tonight Show appearance and the changing nature of Montauk.  The show concluded with brief discussions about Roger Clemens' return to the Yankees, the upcoming Rotgut gig, and the unsanitary aspects of shared microphones in bars, alongside an anecdote about Anthony punching a friend in a childhood arm-wrestling match.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  Hi everyone!  Did you like the guy in the lobby, Jimmy?  He was like, come on, and then he goes, Captain America to Jimmy.  Oh, did he really?  Yeah, he was a rat for him.  He's happy. He's always happy.  I'd be happy too if I had the easiest job in America.  What does he do? 
[00:00:30]  I don't know.  Except say good morning to us.  He says good morning, and I guess he's like, sign in, sign in, if you don't have a badge.  You don't have a badge?  No, if you don't.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a security dude. I don't know.  We're three days out from the big Rotgut reunion.  Yes, we are.  Oh my god, Friday, 9pm at KJ Farrell's.  KJ Farrell's.  KJ Farrell's.  Belmore.  Yeah, it should be fun.  Pettit Avenue, huh?  Yeah.  Andy owns that whole avenue?  Andy Pettit Avenue, yeah, I think. 
[00:01:00]  Nice.  I think you guys are going to have a full house.  Oh, yeah, I'm seeing a lot of inquiries.  And it's old band with his brother Joe.  Yeah, it should be funny.  You two are the big stars of the band, right?  Oh, well, you know, it's a team effort.  Of course we are.  But you guys were like the Jagger and Richards.  Yeah, we, you know, wrote the songs.  The Lennon and McCartney.  All that garbage.  The Kaja and Goo Goo.  Kaja and the Goo Goo.  And the Goo Goo.  They're the Wilson and Phillips of that band. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Rotgut reunion.  Friday, 9pm.  9p.  KJ Farrell's in Belmore.  Yeah, it should be a lot of fun, I think.  You got some VIP room for us?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All you guys will be taken care of.  Yeah, sure we will.  Definitely.  Are you going?  I'm going to go.  I'm sure the bar owner owes me money for my BAB days.  Oh, probably, right?  I'm going to shake them down.  Hey, remember that gig I did?  Half the bar owners in Long Island owe me money. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, I'll get it to you.  I'll get it to you next Tuesday.  Come on by.  Yeah, just come on by.  Oh, really?  Yeah, thanks.  You're probably in the same boat, right?  Yeah, I've got plenty of those.  Plenty of those.  There's a lot of people that owe me money from years of just doing shitty bar gigs and  shitty radio promotions.  Sometimes I didn't even care if I didn't get paid, like some of those gigs we did up in  Massachusetts.  That was pretty goddamn good.  I ever tell you, when I was in Genesee, I worked for this bar, and the guy used to 
[00:02:30]  pay everyone in cocaine?  But I didn't take the cocaine.  I didn't take the cocaine.  How much coke would you get?  I don't know, because I never got payment in cocaine.  And then he owed months of salary to a lot of people, and one day he just locked those  doors and ran back to Syracuse, never to be seen again.  And to this day, people are fucking pissed off at this guy, and they want their money. 
[00:03:00]  To this day.  They're all a bunch of fucking shysters.  Yep.  Club owners are the worst.  See, if I took my payment in cocaine, I probably would have been all right.  He wouldn't have owed me money.  Or dead.  Oh, yeah.  I dabbled.  I dabbled back in the day.  A little dabbling?  Yeah, that's all I did, was dabble.  I wasn't going to start taking payment in cocaine for my livelihood.  That's a little much.  That's going a little too far now.  Got paid a rent.  Just for the record, it's been many, many, many years. 
[00:03:30]  I'll pay my rent.  Since the Opster did a bump.  I don't do bumps.  I don't even think they were called bumps.  Honestly, it's since the Opster did a bump.  That was such a fucking...  The Opster did some bumps.  It was meant that way, trust me.  That's really funny.  I let me laugh.  Because I look like a girly man, and there I am doing bumps, really.  Was your jaw going?  Some rails.  Doing some rails.  Did some rails. 
[00:04:00]  Did some rails.  Did some bumps.  Just grinding your teeth away.  It was fantastic.  But Joe Rogan got me high in my dream last night, so I want to thank him.  I got to tweet him.  And you guys were all there.  I just told the story.  I should have waited for the air, because now it's just going to fucking suck.  Never works when you stare at Anthony and go, hey, make believe that you didn't hear this  five minutes ago.  I usually play along.  I'm like, really?  And then you go, I just told you that.  I'm like, oh, it's just being the audience. 
[00:04:30]  I know, I know.  We both do that shit.  That trick never works.  But you all were there.  I woke up at 4.20, and Danny goes, 4.20?  I go, trust me.  I didn't mean to say that, but it works as far as the dream goes.  And then I was telling Jimmy, because he's having a problem with sleeping, that at 4.20,  I'm like, you know, I could get another 40 minutes sleep.  So I started doing some ohms.  Oh, my God.  Some of my breathing techniques.  Now, do you have to audibly say ohm?  Supposedly, if you do it silently, it works, too. 
[00:05:00]  Were you?  No, that was more for just a quick joke.  I mean, I was doing breathing exercises, though, and it got me back to sleep.  And next thing you know, I'm in a radio station, and there's Joe Rogan.  And he's fucking passionate about his pot.  Oh, man.  And he's like, you got to try it.  And then we closed the curtains, and he lit up.  And then he goes around the room.  He gets everyone high.  Ooh.  You got high.  I got high?  But then he got to Jimmy.  He goes, oh, that's right.  No, you can't have any.  So you even dream Jimmy doesn't smoke any weed. 
[00:05:30]  I know.  See, I care about you, Jimmy.  I didn't watch you getting high in my dream.  But fast forward, what was happening?  We were all smoking pot, and you were hanging yourself in the corner.  And then Kenny runs in because he's responsible, and Joe's like, oh, that's right.  And he runs into some, like, closet thing with his pot and all his pals because, you know,  he's got his guy.  So they all run in there until the coast is clear.  Then he comes back out. 
[00:06:00]  He gets the rest of his high.  And I swear to you, and I just told the story, I was convinced I was high.  Yeah.  And I was convinced Joe Rogan got me high.  You literally felt high.  How I remember it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  And then the alarm went off.  And I was like, did I just get high with Joe Rogan?  And I'm like, of course I didn't get high with Joe Rogan.  You didn't feel any.  My bed.  You didn't feel residual highness?  No.  I was hoping for that.  Kind of like, oh, man.  No, I was like, fuck.  I was wide awake.  That's weird.  And sharp and alert. 
[00:06:30]  But then in the dream, I was, like, just wandering around trying to find you guys because, you  know, I was left behind.  I'm sure there's some kind of dream fucking catcher that could tell me what that's about.  But it felt real, man.  It was lucid dreaming.  It was great.  That weird half-asleep, half-awake type of state.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are really intense, man.  That's where I get fucking raping.  Yep.  When I got high, man.  That was fun.  I like that.  Do you feel like you could control it when you were having that?  No, we just, oh, you weren't here. 
[00:07:00]  We did a whole dream segment.  No.  He can control his fucking dreams.  I panic.  Very rare, but sometimes I can.  Because I'm a panicky P.  Like, let's say it's a naked woman.  You're having a sex dream or something.  And all of a sudden, I'm so fully aware.  They're like, oh, my God, this is a sex dream.  Try to concentrate.  Next thing you know, I'm a butterfly flying over a mountain.  Oh, man.  Blew it.  But he could control it.  He could calm himself down and go with it.  Me, I just panic.  And, of course, my dream instantly changes into some shitty dream I don't give a fuck about. 
[00:07:30]  The lucid ones are weird where you can feel temperatures and stuff.  Yeah, it's so good.  Like heights, you can feel the cold air.  It's really bizarre.  That must be like when you're light sleeping.  Because I was awake and went back to sleep.  So, obviously, I didn't go back into a deep sleep.  And then that did feel real.  And it did feel like I was just in the moment.  I wasn't panicking that the dream was going to change.  And you can trust Joe Rogan.  So, I'm like, all right.  I'll let Joe Rogan get me high in my dream.  The nicotine patch dreams. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, they're pretty sweet.  Yeah, they're really.  That's, I guess, I guess that's the closest, I guess, I've come to lucid dreaming.  You, those, every day, waking up on the patch, it was just like, yeah, I had to get grounded  for a second.  Just be like, okay, wait, who am I?  Where is everything?  No kidding.  I thought I was just, you know, I thought I was just like some, some king flying on a  carpet through the, through the air.  And, like, you actually had to sit down and be like, oh, shit, I actually have to get up  and get dressed and go to work?  Like, I have, this is my real life.  Oh, no.  And it was really strange.  To, like, reboot your brain. 
[00:08:30]  Like, every day was like that.  But it was kind of cool, because.  Yeah, it's different, right?  It hasn't happened since.  I think melatonin does that.  There's a few things that are notorious for giving you crazy.  The patch absolutely does.  So good.  And I think melatonin is another one that supposedly can give you these fucking weird dreams.  I would look forward to it.  It was one of those things where it was like, oh, I can't wait to have a patch dream.  That's cool.  Dream weed.  Sounds awesome.  Thank you, Kevin.  Yeah, dream weed.  And then if you feel like that in your dream, you should absolutely be able to just kind 
[00:09:00]  of physically.  Do it again.  Will yourself while you're awake into feeling high.  Like, because all the drug is doing is setting off this chain reaction of natural events in  your body.  Right.  It's releasing certain things.  It's just some firing, some synopsis.  Yeah.  So, like, it would be great if you could just sit and go, hey, I'm going to get high.  And then you just, like, shut your eyes and concentrate for a little while.  And then you're like, ah, I'm so fucked up.  Yeah.  You know?  Because it just lets out.  You know what you've got to do physically, mentally, so physically your body kind of does 
[00:09:30]  that.  I was shitty on pot because the next day, my pot quote hangovers, they weren't really like  hangovers like alcohol, obviously.  But everything was just like, I was just, I was just always, like, a step behind the  next day.  And I hated that feeling.  And the only highs I feel these days, aside from booze, you know, which is still great  fun, is when I'm reading a long time without reading glasses on. 
[00:10:00]  And then the next day I wake up and I feel like I'm hung.  Oh, God.  I feel like I've done drugs the night before.  My head hurts and my eyes are all weird.  Yeah.  And my balance is off.  I can't focus.  We're all going to fuck up our eyes, man.  Oh, I know.  You ever get a GTA hangover?  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Hours on end.  You're just playing.  That's pretty much any, like, first person video game.  You just, you can't even move your eyes.  Your head's pounding.  You've got this feeling of weird motion, even when you're looking just straight ahead. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  It's tough to walk and it's even harder to immediately drive after playing Grand Theft Auto.  It's the worst thing in the world.  You don't want to drive right.  Still in game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just focused your eyes way too much.  Yeah.  How about, uh, do you ever have Tetris, Tetris Dreams?  Where you play so much Tetris that you close your eyes and you're trying to go to sleep  but all you see is Tetris blocks falling.  Oh, yeah.  If you play a game longer.  But then you're playing Tetris in your mind.  Like, you're actually playing it in your brain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, that one goes there. 
[00:11:00]  That goes there.  Oh, shit.  That goes there.  Jimmy, how's your sleep, man?  We already know.  See, this is, we have to do this again.  More of that.  But we'll make believe.  I went for my study last night.  Sleep study.  You're, what, third?  My second.  My second, yeah.  In, because I, the, for, I'll, I'll, it'll, I'll be very brief.  Um, this is too technical.  But I, uh, I took a half of an Ambien.  I've never taken that.  It made me nervous in sobriety.  But I'm like, I want to sleep.  Um, and I slept for the first four hours.  I slept from nine to one. 
[00:11:30]  She said I was doing well.  I was in REM sleep.  The machine was working.  Um, and then I was just awake.  And I just couldn't get back to sleep.  What, what woke you?  I had to pee.  The machine, believe it or not, all the wires on me and stuff was actually tolerable.  Because I was so tired.  I was up for 30 hours.  And, uh, and I fucking just couldn't get back to sleep.  And CPAP is when they blow air.  It's just like, it's like a big fan right in your face.  It's really an intense air.  But you get used to it very quickly.  You don't even feel it.  What, what, it's, it's, it's like kind of air locked over your nose and mouth. 
[00:12:00]  But BiPAP, which is what, of course, I, of course, faggot needs BiPAP.  Why wouldn't faggot need BiPAP?  Oh, Jesus.  God forbid.  Um.  I don't want to laugh.  You got to laugh.  But no, it really is.  You got to laugh at Captain America.  It really is.  What's wrong, Captain America?  How you really am in a Captain America?  Stupid superhero, tired superhero.  Tired to sleepy superhero.  Too tired to help, folks. 
[00:12:30]  You can't be a tired superhero.  Yes.  Captain America, help.  I can't.  I'm sleeping.  I'm having hypopneas.  I'm sleeping.  Hypopneas.  I'd love to.  But I'm complex.  I can't be a lethargic superhero.  Oh, it's the worst.  But BiPAP is, it's when you need two different kinds of fucking pressure.  Because when I have CPAP pressure, which helps with my obstructive apnea, which means that  my tongue and my fucking weak, fat pelican neck, when nothing is blocking and that works, 
[00:13:00]  all of a sudden, what does scumbag's brain do?  Pipes up with fucking the central apneas.  So then they get worse, which means I just stop breathing.  Because I am bent on killing myself.  Oh, my God.  I'm saying that's what my mind is doing, even when I'm trying to sleep.  Do you think it's the, oh, my God.  No doubt, it's just end this, end this.  That's crazy.  But, so the thing that corrects both of them, which is the central and the thing, is the  BiPAP, is one of the solutions you can have, where it will, but it changes pressure. 
[00:13:30]  So it's like you're breathing, it goes, and you feel it.  And then it's pressure the whole time, but it feels like pressure's being cut off because  all of a sudden it's giving you less.  Like, it literally feels like, like, I'm taking a nice slow sleep breath, like,  but before I finish my breath, the intense air pressure stops, so it feels like you're  getting a kink in the air.  Oh, man.  So it feels like, oh.  Even though, even though if you took the mask off and held it, you would feel a very constant 
[00:14:00]  strong pressure.  The fucking, the lack, the strong pressure being cut off feels like a fucking, like a  blockage of air.  Oh, man.  And so to keep up with it, you have to change your breathing, which I don't like.  It should be, there should be an auto BiPAP thing where it adjusts to your breathing.  But it's like, you literally have to breathe like this.  Who the fuck breathes like that when they, I want to ask Mr. fucking BiPAP designer.  What were you, what was the matter with you? 
[00:14:30]  Do you have emphysema, you fuck?  Can't they adjust the timing on it where it leaves it longer?  I asked that, and she said, no, she doesn't know how to do that.  What?  I don't know.  What are you, a panting dog that can't sleep?  That was the problem.  But do you have an actual medical slash physical problem?  Oh, yeah.  That prevents you from sleeping?  Absolutely.  Okay, so it's not your head.  Oh, no, my head.  You're not a head case.  My head keeps me awake, like when I couldn't get back to sleep or I have to pee sometimes  when I really don't.  Right.  But no, no, they, when I was asleep, they had done these tests and they said it was,  I think, 33 an hour incidents I was having. 
[00:15:00]  I have like a moderate to severe apnea, which, and then they get these hypopneas, and I  have central and obstructive.  Like Eddie Trunk has been really helpful to me, and so has Johnny from the Hard Rock,  believe it or not.  Those are guys that are both really supportive, and they're like, dude, you're going to get  through it.  But they have obstructive.  So they have their fucking, their CPAP pressure set, and it works for them, and it changes your  life.  But with me, the CPAP pressure gets set, and then the fucking central apnea starts, which  is my brain just not, like, and they could tell because they have a, you know, 
[00:15:30]  you sleep with something around your stomach, too, and there's no effort.  Like, there's no effort to breathe from your stomach, so they know you're not even trying  to breathe.  So you're just sitting there, and I'll go through two or three cycles without breathing,  and I'll just wake up going, I'm not breathing.  Oh my God.  That happens to me every night.  Like, that's how I sleep.  That's why I'm, fuck, it's horrendous.  It's horrendous.  So you get these, the fucking machine I got, the APAP machine, is just, which is an automatic  CPAP. 
[00:16:00]  It's not the same as BiPAP.  It's just not working for me.  It's making it worse.  Maybe they need, like, brain surgery or something.  Maybe they could slip some kind of pith in your head and wipe out that little part.  Dude, the cycle, I wish it would, they could do, eventually they will.  You know, 50 years from now, we'll look at, this will be looked at like fucking rickets,  you know.  But it's so frustrating, and I hate to keep talking about it, but it's got me in such  a depression.  It's just like, I just, I was just like, I can't live like this.  And I keep going and trying to do the right thing and trying to fix it, and it's unfixable. 
[00:16:30]  It's unfixable.  Well, it's got to be fixable.  I keep thinking that.  There might be people worse out there that are taking care of it.  Maybe, but dude, I'm not.  You just haven't figured out the combination yet.  I'm a bad, mentally I'm a bad sleeper too.  Like, I'm a bad, like, some guys can just fuck it.  Like, Kenny.  Kenny.  Rich Voss.  Like, they both, Kenny snores.  Like, you ever fly with Kenny?  It's like you're watching his dumb lips go like, and you just want to fucking pinch him.  But Kenny can fall asleep anywhere. 
[00:17:00]  I can't.  But he's one of those guys that can fall asleep.  I am Mr. Sleepy Guy.  God, I'm jealous of that.  Ah, he's ending so much.  I'm not as bad as you, but.  I had four good hours.  I'm always aware.  If I'm on a plane, I'm aware I'm asleep, and that wakes me up.  It's just terrible.  I was 2.30.  The trainer came over.  By 2.30, I was on the couch, fucking out like a light.  I woke up at, like, 10 p.m. 
[00:17:30]  Jeez, how do you do that?  It's just fucking fog.  Because I just get engrossed in sleep.  I couldn't tell you the last time I had eight straight hours of sleep.  If I get six, which I get some days, that I'm happy.  Yeah.  I usually get less than six every night.  That's why people are always saying, when do you sleep, man?  Because I'll be tweeting at 2.30 in the morning.  It's like, because I woke up a couple hours ago.  And you're.  From an entire day.  And you're rested.  You get an actual sleep in.  Yeah.  If the weather's nice, I won't sleep.  I'll go outside and fucking hang out and cool and stuff. 
[00:18:00]  But yesterday, it was like thunderstorming and shit.  I was like, fuck this.  Where?  It's not in New York.  Yeah, by my house.  Well, we had a little.  Thunderstorms and pouring fucking rain.  Really?  Yeah.  We had a little when it moved through, but.  Oh, it was terrible, so I just.  Speaking of weather.  Hey, hey.  Man.  New Orleans.  What's the next step, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I really don't.  I don't.  I almost was just like, I almost walked out at one of the morning and just said enough.  Oh. 
[00:18:30]  But I didn't.  I stayed there.  And I'm like.  You gotta hang in there.  Just wheel you around in an iron lung.  It's fun.  Even that.  It's like, even that.  Like, you know, again, sometimes I think of Patrice in those moments.  It's like, you know, there's weird when you're, that's what you need when you're feeling claustrophobic  to think of your friend who was locked in.  Ah.  That helps.  But I think of like the torture of having it breathe for you and being aware of that  in that, in that month.  Like how awful it is to live, people that live like that, man, that fucking live, not  being able to breathe for themselves and not being able to force a breath when you feel 
[00:19:00]  like you need one psychologically.  Right.  It really is horrifying.  And it's like, I feel like there's no end in sight.  I've run the course with treatments and it's just never going to change.  And I really do feel very helpless.  What about Dr. Steve?  He's, Dr. Steve is a genius, but I don't think he can help with this because it's just  not his area and he can't hook me up and titrate me.  And I've had that done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There's nothing Steve can do.  The closest ever to feeling like I couldn't breathe or something. 
[00:19:30]  And it wasn't even that I couldn't breathe.  I wasn't, wasn't allowed to for a second.  Uh, when you're taking one of those echo cardio things and you run on the treadmill, like a  stress test, you run on the treadmill like crazy.  And then real quick, it's like, okay, go to the treadmill, you got to lay down on your  side.  And then they, they take that sonogram thing and they go, okay, now breathe out as hard  as you can and don't breathe back in.  It's like, wait, I'm fucking, I just got done running.  It's almost impossible.  You're like, and you feel like you're, you're fucking just going to explode. 
[00:20:00]  I went through that with our fat heart doctor.  I'm obsessed with our fat heart doctor.  I got to find someone new.  So you know what I realized you do?  You breathe out, but not all the way.  Right.  And then you slowly breathe out the rest of the way.  And it feels like you're not just, and they still are able to get a good day.  It's so hard to do.  Yeah.  And then you're like, you just take that big breath in.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah.  I have a thing where I, I forced myself to yawn.  Like I feel like I'm not breathing.  Oh, I love yawning.  But I can't yawn, but I can't yawn. 
[00:20:30]  Just listen to the replay.  Yeah, really?  That's like, that's like ocean sounds.  Just put the dumb show on.  See, I told you they suck.  They're now admitting it.  They're now admitting it.  Copy paste the audio.  Make sure everyone hears it.  Copy paste, copy paste.  I can't yawn sometimes.  Like when I want to yawn, I feel like I'm doing it just to, there's a weird syndrome.  I have something to fuck it.  I got a respiratory therapist on the line. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, cool.  I hope he's recommending a fucking, the special respiratory, it's where you place the fucking  barrel in your mouth, and then you hook your toe up to the fucking, the machine helper.  Start car in garage, breathe deep.  There's the on button.  Really?  I just flick this with my toe?  Yeah, it works wonders.  It'll open you right up.  Fucking faggot face.  Takes care of both types.  You want to talk to this guy?  I do, yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Mike.  Mike, where are you calling from?  Hi, Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm from Jersey.  Hi, buddy. 
[00:21:30]  Jersey.  Nice.  Hey, man, I'm actually a respiratory therapist.  I'm on my way to work right now, but I'm also a patient of why you can also take CPAP  at home.  And dude, I...  You're like a hair club guy.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  No, but I tell all my patients, dude, you gotta use this.  It's good for you, but then when I use it at home, I can use it for like maybe an  hour.  Because my pressures are pretty much like 12, 13.  I think Jimmy knows what I'm talking about.  Yes.  My pressure's really high.  So the only thing my doctor recommended is to change the interface, you know, that mask 
[00:22:00]  they put on your face.  Yes.  You could change that one out or you could like, let's see, they say also don't eat any  carbs after six because that keeps you up.  Any little thing that you eat, well, shit, that's what they tell me.  Like, don't eat anything after a certain time because you, your body reacts to a certain  way.  You can't fall asleep.  Yeah, the carbs.  Sorry to interrupt you, buddy.  You're right, though.  The carbs, I actually, I woke up at one in the morning last night and I ate a fucking  small thing of pretzels.  I didn't stay away from carbs.  I ate a little thing of goldfish.  I was just starving. 
[00:22:30]  But yeah, the carbs do keep you up, right?  They're fucking bad at night.  Carbs.  You can't do your caffeine or your sodas.  No, I've been doing good with that.  I mean, you gotta do that five, six hours before you go to sleep, believe it or not.  Yeah, I mean, I can't eat anything after seven.  If not, then fuck.  I'm up for like hours and I'm just like, I'm looking at the time.  I have to be at work at 645 and I'm just like, oh, this is bullshit.  Let me ask you a BiPAP question because she told me that my BiPAP pressure was 10 over  six.  That's the one I was sleeping well with, which is not that bad, but it was the six part  that fucking kills me.  Is there something called an auto BiPAP? 
[00:23:00]  Like, they have auto CPAP, which kind of interprets your breathing and kind of works with you.  Is there an auto BiPAP which won't stop rushing the air until I'm finished fucking inhaling?  All right, now the BiPAP you have, all right, what she gave you was, you have two levels.  You have an inspiratory pressure and an expiratory pressure.  Now, the inspiratory pressure is not too bad, but that, the end result is the EPAP, which  is that CPAP.  That's the same thing.  Right.  You can't breathe. 
[00:23:30]  Now, you can't breathe over that because it's like breathing against something.  And that setting you have is actually the lowest setting we put on patients to start  with.  And then we start titrating up the pressures to affect.  Okay.  She said I slept pretty well like that.  She said I slept very well.  I got deep in.  There was no hypopathy or any of that stuff.  Do you have a ramp on your CPAP?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I tend to just take the stairs.  LOL.  But yeah, there is.  It's a 45-minute ramp up, I think, or whatever. 
[00:24:00]  And you use it, and it doesn't work at all?  Nah, I need BiPAP, dude.  Yeah, I mean, BiPAP is actually easier to breathe than CPAP, because CPAP is just that  constant pressure in your face.  I mean, it depends which one you use.  I like that better, dude.  I like the constant pressure, because the guys who are like O&A, you haven't had it on,  but when it's locked on your face, you don't feel the pressure.  Like, if you take it off, it's like a jet engine.  But when it's locked on your face, you literally don't feel like there's something blowing on you. 
[00:24:30]  I just can't imagine sleeping that way.  Oh, my God.  And they don't have any options.  Like, my doctor said I have moderate to severe.  I thought you were a therapist.  You don't sleep.  Who me?  Yeah.  I am a therapist, yeah.  And the doctors that I see from my own sleep apnea said, oh, dude, you can't get the surgery,  because the surgery is a 50% thing.  And I'm like, 50%?  Like, it's going to work half the time?  I'm like, that's some bullshit.  And then he's like, I can't give you that mouthpiece, because that doesn't work either  on you, because your apnea is pretty severe.  He said I get, like, 40 to 50 episodes an hour. 
[00:25:00]  And I'm like, what?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you're a little more severe than I am.  But Danny just pulled up something for Respironics that I looked up.  It's a BiPAP auto with Biflex.  I don't know what Biflex is.  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  It's certain insurances.  They say yay or nay on that shit.  But, you know, sometimes they'll be like, no, we're not paying it, or just deal with  what you got.  And, you know, some insurances are good like that, that they just say, okay, just try this  out.  Because I tried out mine for, like, three or four years, and I was dating a doctor at  the time, and she's like, dude, you, like, wake up a million times a day, you snore a 
[00:25:30]  lot of them shit, and she's just like, yo, you need to go get that sleep test.  And I did, but I probably used it in the four years I've had it, maybe, like, 25 times.  Not even.  See, I want to use it, because Eddie Trunk and Johnny, dude, these guys, like, literally,  I've talked to both of them enough, and it's like, they are so, let me tell you something,  the fans, like, I know a lot of you guys are sick of this, and I apologize, but the fucking  people who have this shit, I've gotten so many emails from people, it's fucking amazing 
[00:26:00]  how people, like, are empathetic with it, they're like, dude, just hang in there.  But, you say, after a while, I don't want to hang in there anymore.  Oh, no.  No, no, I mean with the sleep shit, I can't, it's unfixable.  It's unfixable.  I feel like it's unfixable.  You know what, Jill, you just have to, like, actually try to, like, trunk sense.  Bear with it, bro.  What about the fucking, because she wouldn't give me, I went in for a BiPAP, which is what  I just told you guys, and something called ASV, and she wouldn't do that because she said  I didn't have a breathing syndrome or something. 
[00:26:30]  No, yeah, you don't want to use that.  Yeah, that's for, like, that's for really bad cases.  And, I mean, yours is not too bad that you just completely, like, you know, you cease  to breathe.  I mean, you actually wake yourself up, but ASV is definitely not for you.  What's it called, the breathing?  It begins with a C?  What, Chanian breathing or something?  Oh, Chan Stokes.  Chan Stokes breathing.  Right, right, right.  And that's what she said that's for.  Yeah, that's, yeah, exactly.  That's, like, neuromuscular stuff.  You don't want to use that.  Okay. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, but, I mean, you know, dude, just, like I tell my patients, keep trying to use  it, although, like, even my doctor said, even if you use it for an hour, it's more than  anything you've ever, you know, used it before.  So, just keep using it, and you know what?  Eventually, your face and your body are going to get used to it.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  All right, take care, man.  And there's actually, you know, in Australia, the genius that they are, they have these masks  that are custom designed, like, but you can't, it's in Australia, but they make a mold  on your face, and they said that's more comfortable. 
[00:27:30]  Well, they have nothing better to do over there.  That really is true.  They pour a hot sauce that's right in the top of it, too.  No, it's kangaroo pump.  They smash you in the balls with a didgeridoo until you fall asleep.  Jimmy, have you tried a polyphacic sleep schedule yet?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Polyphacic?  Yeah.  No.  Oh.  Can I, can the guy tell me what that means?  I'm trying everything. 
[00:28:00]  I might go to Columbia Presbyterian.  Yeah?  I'm thinking of going to the Mayo Clinic.  Whoa.  There's just literally no, there's no.  Let's learn about poly.  That's why Iraq runs.  It's not even here.  Let's learn about the polyphacic or phasic sleep schedule.  Tampa, what's up?  Yeah, I was just calling for Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  It's a sort of a method of sleeping where you just try to focus on getting the REM sleep.  It's called polyphasic.  And there's different types of sleep schedules that you can do. 
[00:28:30]  Now, the most extreme one is a 20-minute nap about every two hours.  It can be pretty brutal to get into, but I've read some studies where people are able to get this polyphasic sleeping down.  And the thing is, when you're getting your REM knocked out in 20 minutes every two hours, you only have the time to get into where you're having the obstructive breathing and things like that.  Oh, okay.  So there's a schedule where you sleep 20 minutes every two hours.  There's a schedule where you sleep 40 minutes every four.  Jesus.  Mixed schedules where you sleep straight through for two, and then you nap two or three times throughout the day. 
[00:29:00]  But the schedules can be pretty rigid, but once you get them down, you're actually getting enough sleep, and you feel well-rested and pretty good.  And it might be something that you could look into if you're having problems sleeping, for example.  Honestly, I would never be able to.  Because, dude, my head is so fucking...  Like, I'm so bad in my head that I would never be able to do that.  Plus, my schedule's too crazy.  Like, I'm here so early.  I'll go home.  I mean, I'm flying to L.A. today.  But, I mean, like, a lot of times I'll go home and nap a little bit. 
[00:29:30]  I've got to do stand-up at night.  But, you know what?  I've been eating pretzels and fucking Diet Cokes late at night at the cellar.  That's going to keep me up.  Yeah, that stuff's going to hurt you, too.  If you eat something really fatty, that's usually pretty good, a nice saturated fat or a protein.  Really?  But, yeah, you kind of want to stay away from the carbs.  All carbs, especially if you have problems sleeping.  No, I'd encourage you just to do a little search on it, maybe read about it.  Okay.  It can be kind of extreme, but if you can get used to it, I mean, even on the show here,  if you need to disappear for 20 minutes and take a nap or something and then come back. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, where would I sleep for 20 minutes?  Where would I sleep?  There's nowhere to sleep.  Like, literally.  I'll do it right in my chair.  Dude, I literally do it.  He's fast in the chair.  He's just disappearing for 20 minutes.  I have a king-sized pillow top bed, and I fucking toss and turn.  You think it's SiriusXM?  Maybe I can go there and get fucking Gary and Blatter to talk to me.  Could you guys tell me some plans for the company?  All right, thank you very much, buddy.  I was changing your position, too.  All right, well, okay. 
[00:30:30]  Vice President.  Thanks, buddy.  This guy's very excited.  All right, good luck.  Take care, my thanks.  All right, let me go to Joe.  Joe, what do you say, Joe?  That last dude they called was a retard.  Oh, here it is.  It's every time.  It's every time.  That last guy, he was an asshole.  Why, Joe?  Jimmy needs a fucking dick pill intervention, man.  You ever watch a fucking Cialis commercial, man?  Yep.  Every fucking withdrawal or whatever that comes from that, man. 
[00:31:00]  You know what?  It's funny you say that, but I know that that lowers your blood pressure, I think, and that  also contributes to central apnea, but that's not my problem.  Wait, how many dick pills do you take a week?  Not that many.  It says on the office.  But he said not that many.  Maybe...  No, no, not during the week.  I'll go months and months and even a year without taking one.  But I'm sure that could exacerbate...  The only thing that's a fucking dick harder than fucking dick pills is fucking methamphetamine. 
[00:31:30]  All right, he's suggesting come some crystal meth, Jim.  And not even fucking...  Yeah, dude, I know what you mean about the pills, but I don't think that's my problem.  I'm sure that can exacerbate it, but that's not what's causing me to have obstructive and  then central.  I know what you mean, though, but...  Well, listen to the side effects.  Yeah, that's...  You're right.  That's...  I'm agreeing with you.  I just don't think that's the main problem.  Dick pills.  All right.  All right.  This call is a...  The last call, it was an asshole. 
[00:32:00]  I'll tell you what it is.  I have no idea.  Kramer tried the polyphasic sleep, and it didn't work.  Did it happen on Seinfeld?  That's when he was trying to sleep for, like, yeah, he was just taking naps.  I don't remember.  15 minutes at a time.  15 minutes at a time.  It didn't work out very well for him, either, so...  Can't do it.  You have to be so disciplined to just take 20-minute naps throughout the day.  How do you...  No way.  And how could you possibly do that?  What kind of schedule can you have... 
[00:32:30]  Right.  ...where you're allowed...  You can do it...  I imagine a housewife or something who has no kids, who's home, but how do you fucking...  Just nod out.  What job allows you to do that, or where can you do it?  Like, all right, guys, you keep doing the office.  I'm just going to sit here in the fucking corner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking conk out with my fucking Timex alarm.  20 minutes.  Beep, beep, beep.  Time to wake up.  Oh, I would hate having to go through that whole waking up thing that many times a day.  Oh, my God.  I want to wake up once.  Exactly.  And not deal with it again until the next fucking morning. 
[00:33:00]  It's terrible.  Oh, right.  You got to get up, fuck.  A good one-hour nap can help you.  Like, you know, you take a nice hour nap in the day.  That ain't that bad.  Sometimes they say the hour's too much.  Is it?  Really?  Sometimes they say about 45 minutes.  No way.  Well, our schedules are weird, but...  Yeah.  They say, you know, anything over an hour, then you start to fuck with your sleep for the night.  Oh, really?  Any sleep I can fucking get.  The research I've done.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  To try to figure out my dumb shit.  But I can't have coffee after three. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I don't have it at night either.  I'll go to Starbucks and go, I don't know.  It's 3.05.  Can I have this coffee?  It'll keep me up, though.  Six hours later, when I have to fall asleep, it'll keep me up.  It's so dumb.  I was such a good boy yesterday.  I had no coffee in the afternoon.  I fucking blew a load.  I made myself blow a load so I wouldn't have that old fucking cum wake up.  You know, when you need to cum.  Me and Jonathan fucking went out and I had a nice fucking peppermint tea at Starbucks.  I iced, no caffeine. 
[00:34:00]  You sure the peppermint tea doesn't have any kind of sugar or caffeine in it?  He said, no sugar, no caffeine.  Okay.  And I went and had a nice glass of water aft.  I was good.  And it didn't matter.  Four hours.  Boy, I fucking fell right asleep, though, with that study.  I couldn't believe all those wires that fell asleep.  But why did you drink the water?  I would have kept my bladder as empty as possible.  This was hours before because we were, I forget we were eating.  Drink some cat litter and just soak it up.  Yeah, I'm eating rosin bags off Pitcher's Mounds.  Get arrested at Shea Stadium. 
[00:34:30]  I don't want to tinkle.  You want to hear from a guy that lived on two hours of sleep a night for 17 years.  Dana White.  It's notoriously terrible.  Andy, what's up, buddy?  Not too much, man.  How you doing?  All right.  We're doing all right.  That's bad for your heart, by the way, Andy.  That's why I care about this stuff.  No, seriously.  Not sleeping is terrible for your heart.  Well, I had chronic insomnia.  It was a problem.  I could never sleep, so I only slept two hours a night. 
[00:35:00]  What did you do?  Stayed up, watched TV, got on the computer.  It's a really, really boring time.  I find myself getting rageful at myself.  The first thing I did when I got out of bed this morning is I bit my arm.  I'm just like, you fucking worthless cunt.  Because it's me keeping me up.  So what did you...  I think you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to sleep.  Yeah.  I think that's part of the problem.  I think you're hearing that over and over again. 
[00:35:30]  It's got to be at least part of it.  You're putting a panic in your head.  After a while, you just freak out thinking about it.  Yes.  Pretty much, yeah.  How did you fix it?  I think it just finally caught up to me.  I'm up to about four hours now.  Okay.  But, you know, that's the way it's been.  And I don't want to take it, like...  Again, I'm so worried about getting hooked to you.  Any type of sleeping pill you take, you're just going to need more and more to get the  effect.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you what's helped me a little bit recently.  Is it taking a fucking... 
[00:36:00]  Is doing these...  A steroid nose spray during the day, which I have a prescription for.  Yeah.  It's not addictive.  And my fucking mouth guard.  That combination has helped a little bit, but...  It's just not real sleep.  I tried everything.  I tried sleeping pills.  I tried all that stuff.  There's nothing that could stop.  There's just nothing that helped.  Wow.  You took sleeping pills and they didn't work?  Yeah, I took Ambien.  I took all sorts of different stuff.  You're just hiring a UFC guy every night to punch you in the face.  Just slug you.  I actually have John Jones come over and just put me to sleep. 
[00:36:30]  A sleeper.  Oh, fuck.  So, what's the other one?  There's Ambien.  There's another one, too.  It's under Ambien.  Say that again?  There's another one that's over the counter.  Lunestra.  That might be it.  Yeah.  What did he say?  Lunestra.  Don't start.  Don't go with the sleep pills.  That stuff doesn't really work.  Does melatonin, do you get used to that?  Like, my friend said she takes melatonin every night.  And I take it, if I take it once every month, it works really well.  But I'm afraid, like, the second and third night in a row wouldn't work. 
[00:37:00]  I feel like all that stuff, maybe if you do it every once in a while, it's good.  Right.  I mean, that's not going to solve your problem in the end.  Have you tried warm milk?  Oh, yeah.  I've tried warm milk.  It kind of works.  Because I guess it brings back, it brings you back to being a baby suckling on a pit.  Suckling.  Oh, God.  But you've got to warm it up.  You've got to warm it up a little bit.  How about you just suck on a tit?  That sounds good until you nod off.  I said, ugh, because the breast milk part of it. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, well, no.  Not the breast milk.  Yeah, no.  You've got to try some warm milk tonight, Jimmy.  Just a little bit.  I'll tell you why.  Because I'll have to pee.  I'll be farting.  And I'll be going, ehhh.  Because God forbid I can process lactose.  Because also, dick, dick fucking face, BiPAP faggot machine also can't tolerate milk or lactose products.  People are actually saying, don't give up, Jimmy.  Keep your nothing up.  Yeah, exactly.  I should just take my fucking...  And by the way, that's why I put weight on. 
[00:38:00]  And I'm just in complete...  I force myself to go to the gym sometimes.  I want to just be awake and go to the gym and fucking be a fucking person.  The other problem is that you don't have a sleep schedule.  No, I don't.  Because of everything you're doing.  You're flying L.A. today, so that's going to fuck you up.  And then when you come home, that fucks you back up.  You know?  And then when you gig, you drive all night and then finally go to sleep in the morning.  Yeah.  You're not sleeping on a regular basis with a schedule.  But even when I do, man...  I try to get to bed at 10 every night as much as I can. 
[00:38:30]  That fog, that fog you live with when you're always...  Like when I shot in Cleveland, I woke up, I said to Kenny, and I saw Danny that day because we were doing the posters.  Like, I was just in a fog.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like literally it's being...  You know, you're being...  It's like being high all the time.  So tired.  I've been that way here when I haven't gotten a good night's sleep where we'll be sitting and a guest will be talking to something.  And I swear, I'm like, my eyes feel like they're crossing.  I'm just like, I'm so fucking tired.  I've always liked that.  Oh, that's it. 
[00:39:00]  How could you be so tired yet not able to sleep?  That's like something that's almost impossible.  But I'll be like that after eight hours.  Jesus.  Nine hours.  Yeah.  I think it's in your head, Jimmy.  The more I listen.  Oh, man.  No, that's...  When I'm out for eight hours and I'm not getting the proper sleep, that's a physical thing.  Let's go meditate together.  I would like that.  Masturbate.  I don't want to hear your ohms, though.  You've got to keep your ohms quiet.  No, because I sniffle too much.  Oh, man.  Here's a guy that thinks it's in your head as well.  Let me see what Brennan says. 
[00:39:30]  Ohm.  Ohm.  Ohm.  Ohm is where the odd is.  I paid him.  I don't ohm.  I don't fucking call me a...  Yes, sir.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hi, buddy.  Hey.  Jimmy, I got...  I just started driving a truck not too long ago and I got flagged for a sleep study when  I did that because of the diameter of my neck.  And I have about the same apnea hypopnea index as you.  Okay.  And when I was younger, I used to have a lot of problems sleeping, like when I was in high 
[00:40:00]  school and shit like that.  And I...  It surprised me to find that I had it because I had done sleep studies in the past and hadn't  come up with anything like that.  Right.  But the thing ultimately, the CPAP machine is something you can get used to, but it doesn't  help me sleep.  I sleep worse with the CPAP machine.  Ultimately, it's being able to just let go of shit and sleep.  Like you asked that other guy the question that I wanted to ask you, which is what do  you do?  Like when you sleep for four hours and then you're just awake, are you doing anything or 
[00:40:30]  are you just laying there stressing about it, trying to go back to sleep?  It's a combination of...  Like I think...  I literally think of absolute craziness, but I'm trying to...  I'll tell you a fucking weird thing I think of when I'm trying to sleep.  And this is the truth.  I'll think of plummeting out of a plane or I think of 9-11 a lot when I'm trying to sleep.  I really do. 
[00:41:00]  And I think of if you could...  But 2001 or 2...  No, 3!  Ah, that would have been good.  No, actually earlier.  Ah, fuck!  I fucked up.  Yeah, I'll think of September 11th, 1975.  I watched Don Kirshner's rock concert.  I suck!  Oh boy, I crashed and burned.  I'll think of all these crazy fucking things like being...  Not of dying, but of actually being on the top floor and watching that happen.  Or I'll think of falling out of buildings.  Or I'll think of all these crazy fucking things and the times that actually helps me sleep. 
[00:41:30]  But, uh...  So you're talking about doing that kind of stuff as like a thought exercise to get yourself into the place where you can fall asleep again.  Yeah.  So the other thing too, like Ope said, he can't remember when the last time he got full straight eight hours of sleep is.  Not everybody is going to be on the same sleep schedule.  And I, like I've worked at the, there's a sleep study center at Yale that I worked at for a little while too.  The way that they determine whether or not you're getting into REM fast enough and everything is based on an average. 
[00:42:00]  But there are people that don't fall into that.  And like that guy saying he slept for two hours, there are some people that that's just natural for them.  That's what they need and it's what they get.  If you're going to sleep for four hours and struggling to get back, you might just want to seriously get up and just do something.  Find something to just do that you enjoy doing and just let that sleep happen when it happens and not stress out about trying to sleep.  Because that's going to be the worst.  Try to push the panic down.  And just accept that some nights I'm just going to get four hours. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I used to panic like, oh my God, you're not asleep yet.  It's 11.  Oh my God, what are you doing?  And then one day I just kind of let it all go.  And then if you are like wide awake, they say you got to get out of fucking bed for like even five fucking minutes.  Go to the refrigerator and drink some orange juice out of the bottle or whatever the fuck.  Walk around your apartment, check your email real fast and go back to bed.  And it throws you off this fucking cycle of not being able to knock yourself down into a sleep.  That shit has worked for me.  I don't know.  I've actually thought of you.  When I've gotten out of bed, I'll be like, get out of bed. 
[00:43:00]  I've done it.  I've actually done that.  You've got to get out of bed.  I can't check the email though because the computer, man, once I'm on the computer.  Or whatever, whatever it is.  Look out your dumb window for a couple minutes.  Reading is usually good.  Yeah.  But my whole life has been like this.  Like I was a kid.  I have memories now looking back.  When I was a kid, I fucking, and I just bought one.  Like you know those little Vicks inhalers?  They're shaped like little rocket ships and you shake them and they go like.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you open them and then you put them under your nostril and there's this like menthol blast.  Like when I was like seven and eight, I would use those.  And I would always rub Vicks VapoRub on my chest because I couldn't breathe. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, that wasn't Vicks.  It was a really cool applicator.  It felt like two male legs straddling in a very heavy bag on the chest.  Sure.  So I just wonder if it's in your head because my sleep problem, it's gotten way better.  But it was in my head because, you know, I've said it growing up.  My mom would check to make sure we were breathing in the middle of the fucking night.  So I was saying it was Uncle Vick.  It's Vicks on my chest.  Vicks. 
[00:44:00]  But she would check on us in the middle of the night over and over again.  And then there was such chaos in my house.  You never wanted to, you know, go into a deep sleep because you were wondering when the next problem was right around the corner.  And I finally became aware of all that as an adult.  I went, oh, this is why I sleep so fucking shallow.  Do you know when I sleep?  So I wonder if it's in your head, Jimmy.  Do you know when I sleep well and I sleep better on planes during the day?  Like on the red eye coming back.  I'm coming back tomorrow night.  See, that's crazy to me.  I wouldn't be able to sleep on a fucking plane. 
[00:44:30]  Well, I can't.  So that makes me think that you can sleep.  During the day, I can.  On a night flight, on the red eye tomorrow night coming back, I'll be the only guy awake.  For the whole ride.  Oh, wide awake, wide awake, counting fucking stars.  Three, 5,214,874.  Just looking out at the vastness and the darkness by yourself.  And feeling guilty.  That's fucking creepy.  Feeling guilty being on my computer because the plane is pitch black.  And it's lighting up half the plane, half your section.  When I go home during the day, dude, in the afternoon, if I want to take a nap, I can usually sleep pretty fucking well. 
[00:45:00]  Like if I want to just crash after the radio show, I can usually get a good four or five hours.  So then why don't you just let that happen?  Yeah, but then I'm awake all night.  So?  Oh, the whole thing just restarts the cycle.  Oh, it's a vicious, vicious cycle.  But let it go.  If that's when you're sleeping, let it happen.  Don't even like set an alarm or anything.  Let it just fucking happen.  You know what I mean?  It hurts doing spots at night, too, because then it's like a double.  You have to gear yourself up twice. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And that's what the hard part is.  It's fucked up.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, that makes it a little bit harder.  Because you're doing stand-up at night and morning radio.  I don't even know how you could possibly do that.  If I could just sleep, it's honestly easy.  It's just a matter of not the sleeping is what gets me.  Right.  But I appreciate everybody's input, and I know people are trying to help me.  And I do appreciate all the emails.  Don't kid yourself.  We were just trying to kill an hour.  Oh, no.  But I mean the fucking 300-pound truckers that email me.  Dude, I'm dealing with this.  But there really are a lot of people out there.  It's like the phones light up when you talk about this shit. 
[00:46:00]  Dude, it's unbelievable.  How many people have fucking sleep issues, man?  They care more about this than who our next president's going to be.  Look at these phones.  All right.  Want a break?  Yeah, we got commercials.  Oh, yeah, a lot of them.  I don't know what happened, but our food's here.  And also, we love Camden.  We've been focusing on Camden over the years, and boy, we got an update on their police force. 
[00:46:30]  It's wonderful.  Just shows you the state of the nation in general, I think.  I don't know.  We'll explain next.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNF3 Show.  You got to like this one, right, Ant?  I do like this.  Oh, good.  Ant's not a huge Zeppelin fan.  Not a huge.  We have learned over the years.  I like some of their tunage.  Will Rotgut be playing Zeppelin?  Nah. 
[00:47:00]  It was Zeppelin.  Why?  I don't know.  It doesn't really fit.  Could it hit those notes if you had to?  That's another thing.  That's pretty rough.  Those are pretty rough to hit and sound really good doing it.  Yeah.  Bang.  Uh-oh.  Jimmy's listening.  What?  No, I was going to say something.  No, no, no.  I have a comment on somebody who sings well live, but I know you're reading something.  No, not really.  I was just going to pump up the big Rotgut reunion gig.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony and his brother's old band there, Friday at 9 p.m. at KJ Farrell's in Belmore. 
[00:47:30]  I'm actually going to go to that.  On Pettit Avenue.  That'll be fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's going to be a pisser.  All you guys down there, we'll VIP it.  We'll get some bottles, yo.  Yeah.  We'll get a table.  Reserve a table.  Get some bottle service, yo.  Yeah, that'll be fun.  You guys always come and support my gigs, and I never get to...  There's no gigs to go to.  It's like I...  I know.  When's the last time it was a Rotgut gig?  A long time ago.  I know.  It's kind of rhetorical.  Yes.  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[00:48:00]  What the fuck?  Where's Uncle Vinny?  I miss him.  Oh, God.  You don't miss Uncle Vinny?  Not really.  Ah, that's too bad.  I like that guy.  He was funny.  No, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  But after a little while...  After a little while, he just took on a right.  What the fuck?  Snooki had her baby, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  What was it?  A boy?  Lorenzo, I guess.  So I would assume that's a boy.  Jezelnik had a funny line on Twitter.  He's fucking really funny.  I swear.  Do you ever check Anthony Jezelnik's... 
[00:48:30]  No.  No.  He has some very mean, funny tweets.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a bit of a cunt.  And I say that with affection.  But you know who's a really good singer live, man?  And I know most people in this room are not merciful Fate fans.  But fucking...  Are you a Fate fan, Danny?  Yeah.  You like that stuff?  I don't know a lot of their stuff, but I do like what I feel like.  King fucking Diamond is amazing.  And he has a really weird...  Like, you know...  He's one of those metal guys that sings with a really... 
[00:49:00]  Like a zebra, almost high pitch.  And I was watching him live yesterday, just Googling shit.  Because I had nothing else.  You know, why wouldn't I be writing my own show or doing something creative?  I'd rather just watch King Diamond sing in 1999.  But you work on his shit a lot.  You should give yourself a chance to just chill out.  I don't...  You work really hard, Jimmy.  I do a decent amount, but I don't do enough.  And I'm not being mock humility.  I'm being really honest.  I should be doing more.  It's not Uncle Vinny.  It's Uncle Nino, of course.  Yeah, we knew him.  I actually knew who he meant.  That's just how unimportant his name is. 
[00:49:30]  You know why?  Because I was driving down the Jersey Shore, and I finally saw where that Uncle Vinny's is.  That's in where?  A wild wood?  No, it's in...  No, Point Pleasant.  Point Pleasant.  Yeah, I drove by that earlier this summer.  I went, oh, that's where all those guys do their gigs down on the shore.  Not a particularly hot town, but they were nice at the gig.  The people who ran it were very nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, Uncle Nino.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, these fans.  Right, right, right.  Of course.  Nino.  Yes.  So I guess Governor Christie didn't want to be the vice president-elect because he didn't 
[00:50:00]  think Romney could win this thing.  Now, who said that?  Supposedly someone close to his camp.  Oh, I don't know.  Well, supposedly someone close to going to Christie himself.  That's why this one is getting a lot of attention.  Maybe early on.  I don't think he...  He probably doesn't think that now, even if he did.  Right.  I think Romney's got a pretty good shot here.  I saw Newt Gingrich on one of the news shows yesterday, and he was asked, why do you now 
[00:50:30]  like Romney?  Because obviously during the debates, he fucking hated the guy.  And then he just flat out lies to everyone.  He's like, oh, because of Obama.  It's like, why don't you just be honest?  You don't like Romney.  There's no way Newt Gingrich likes Romney.  No, but you know, you gotta...  These guys all just lie to you.  Yeah.  He fucking hated him in the debates.  It's one of those things.  Like, Hillary was slamming Obama.  I know.  That's why it's all bullshit.  And then she ends up working for him.  They all have to make believe that in the end they like their nominee.  Yeah.  And I will say, because everyone goes, oh, yeah, it works both ways. 
[00:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  The Democrats do the exact same fucking thing.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you have to make believe you like your guy?  That's stupid to me.  That's the rah-rah, let's go team thing.  And I think the lesser of the two evils, the biggest evil being Obama getting reelected...  I hear that.  But Gingrich made it very clear he did not like Romney and did not think he was qualified.  And, you know, next time around when the Democrats do their whole thing, you'll see it play the same exact way.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:51:30]  Wasn't McCain going to take Lieberman as a...  The Sarah Palin movie on HBO was actually pretty good.  It made McCain seem like a really empathetic, nice dude.  It didn't make McCain look bad at all.  Really?  I like McCain.  I do, too.  I actually do like the guy.  Looks like a grouch.  But, no, he actually seems really pleasant.  The guy did fucking five years on the Hanoi Hilton.  Let him come on.  And I think that he was going to take Joe Lieberman.  That would have been a better choice, no?  Much better.  Yeah, yeah.  So what happened?  They never do it. 
[00:52:00]  What do you mean they thought that was weird?  I don't know.  Taking Sarah Palin out of nowhere wasn't weird?  No one even knew who she was.  Nope.  Can't they ever cross party lines?  No.  No.  Never.  You do forget, but no one knew who Sarah Palin was at the time.  Now we all know of her.  Yeah, yeah.  That was just somebody out of nowhere.  It's like some crazy woman from Alaska.  Right.  What are we going to do if she's got to be the vice president?  Yeah, that was kind of wacky.  She's not speaking at the Republican convention?  Nope.  Does that not show you?  Of course.  The absolute lack of respect they have for her? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Definitely.  She blew it.  She was the vice presidential candidate four years ago.  And now she doesn't even speak at the convention.  That's got to be bad.  I don't follow politics that closely, but I think that's got to be really bad.  She's not a bad speaker either.  When you watch her talk, you're like, I understand the attraction to her.  Like, she's not...  She can be very, very magnetic or in front of an audience.  She can be very good.  You know, it's easy to make fun of him, but I kind of like the Governor Christie guy. 
[00:53:00]  Christie's cool.  He's just one of those regular guys.  He's more of a no-nonsense type of guy.  A knock-around guy.  But man, he's a fat fuck.  Oh, he is a big fat fuck.  Look, he's on TV right now.  That is a big suit.  That body is a huge suit.  He looks like he's in a sumo wrestling fucking suit.  Yes, with a business suit on top of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think he's got to go to the big and tall places?  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Brings his own toilet like paparazzi.  He's not even like... 
[00:53:30]  It's not that he has a gut or a fat ass or something.  He's fat all over his body.  He looks like one of those guys that is not supposed to be that fat.  I truly believe you're born with some kind of a body type.  Yeah.  I really do.  But some people just...  I don't think he's supposed to be that big, really.  No one is.  That's fucking fat.  Like, he's just wide.  Like, he can barely move his arms as he's walking.  Look at him waddling as he's walking.  But man, he's a very powerful guy.  He's going for it in 2016. 
[00:54:00]  That we know.  He may have a good shot.  There it is.  He revealed the secret that he should fucking lose some weight, though, if he wants to.  I mean, people get a little frightened of a big, fat president.  Who was our fat president?  Who was the last big, fat president?  Was it Taft?  But who was the last one?  Because they've decided a long time ago, no more fat presidents.  No more fat presidents.  They're usually in pretty good shape.  He has a shot, though, because he comes off not as a big, fat slob, but meaning he doesn't seem like a meek, fat guy. 
[00:54:30]  And I don't even like him that much.  But he's at least a guy who's very, very opinionated.  That's what I like about him.  And seems very sure of himself.  That's what I like about him.  That's a quality that he has in a lot of, like, thank you, my doll.  I like that quality.  I don't like that wishy-washy shit from my politicians.  You know, I might not agree with the guy, but he's like, boom, this is how it is.  There's something to be said about that.  By the way, look at the fucking...  Sorry, Morning Joe is interviewing him? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And how great is it that the fucking...  That fucking Tweety Bird is forced to walk behind him and say nothing?  Oh, he should just cut gassers the whole way down the fucking aisle.  Right in her face.  You gotta think he lets out a fart or two, right?  You're that big.  You can't keep them all in.  You can't keep them all in.  Crap.  Crap.  Yeah.  He's talking, right?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  He's talking.  He's the keynote speaker.  So what?  That's the big spot?  Yeah, that's the big one.  Who had the big spot for Obama? 
[00:55:30]  Who was the keynote for Obama?  Who did?  Who was that?  Didn't Obama have the keynote years ago or no?  He did years ago, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, before he was, I guess, the four years before him.  When is this going down?  Tonight?  Should be some good TV?  Yeah, you know, for whatever these conventions are.  They had to wait for that storm to...  Switching to the converted kind of thing.  They had to wait for that storm to push away from Tampa?  Yeah.  So now it's...  I don't think it made a difference.  Now it's going to be business as usual in Tampa?  New Orleans, man.  They were showing the levees on TV. 
[00:56:00]  So you think New Orleans is going to be all right with this hurricane?  They did so much work.  They've had seven years.  To New Orleans with the levees.  And the Army Corps of Engineers got in there and built some motherfucking levees.  And they have all kinds of fail-safes to open up gates.  Really?  To relieve pressure from these areas.  So I don't know.  I think they'll be okay.  Especially with a Cat 1.  How the fuck do they figure that shit out?  We've been down there.  We've seen the water down there. 
[00:56:30]  How do you figure out, like, okay, we're going to put a fail-safe over here.  We're going to make this levee a little bigger over here.  We're going to do this over here.  They just figure shit out.  And what?  It's the seven-year anniversary, and this is on the exact track as Katrina, but not as strong, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What was Katrina again?  A Cat what?  Three?  Four?  Four.  It was a five in the middle of the gulf when it hit.  It was a three or four, right?  I'm not sure.  I think it was a three when it hit.  Finger regard?  But this is a one. 
[00:57:00]  Could this get to a two?  I don't think they're not even.  I haven't even seen the panicky Pete news suggest that it could get to a two.  I think it's going to be a one for a short time and then go back to Tropical Storm, I think.  Was it a four when it hit?  Are you sure about that?  A four is a...  Wow.  But we all know what a four is because we saw the people on the roofs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't think it was even that strong, though, to tell you the truth.  I thought it was a three.  I thought it was a two.  I thought it was a one and a half. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's pretty much what it was.  A one and a half?  Yeah, see?  I said blah, blah, blah.  Concluded that it's likely much of the city experienced sustained wins of Category 1 or 2 strength.  Yeah.  Katrina?  Yeah.  Wow.  It was a five when it was in the gulf.  It was a motherfucker.  Right.  But it calmed down.  It was moving.  If you remember, it moved really slow that way.  And it lost a lot of strength before it actually hit.  But they were so fucked up, they didn't need a big one.  They were saying if it was a four, forget about it. 
[00:58:00]  It'd still be fucking trying to clean up shit.  Right.  They are.  Well, not really.  Not in the poor areas.  They don't care about poor people.  Just hoping for the next one to wipe the residual shit out.  Yeah.  That's what they're doing.  When is this thing hitting?  Today or tomorrow in New Orleans?  I'm not sure.  What are they saying?  We just don't know.  How fast is it moving?  When it's not around us, we really don't give a shit.  That's pretty much it.  I don't care.  Damn it.  I had a thought.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I really did.  You sure know.  It went fluffed. 
[00:58:30]  Bye.  Bye-bye.  I think this weekend?  Yeah.  It's got to be this weekend.  Oh, no.  Way before this weekend.  Man, we're supposed to maybe feel a little rain by the end of the weekend from this thing.  We're way up here.  Oh, we're way up here.  We're way up here, people.  See, I'm thinking this weekend because my weekend starts.  So I think, oh, the weekend.  Right.  Oh, what are they saying?  Tuesday? 
[00:59:00]  Wednesday?  No, that's Tuesday a.m.  That's where it is right now.  So tonight.  So tonight.  Yeah, Tuesday evening.  Tonight into tomorrow.  Overnight.  Yeah, so by tomorrow morning, we'll know some shit about this hurricane in New Orleans.  Isaac, right?  Isaac's triple threat.  Isaac.  So.  Oh, man.  There it goes right on.  Yeah.  How the fuck does it?  Man, it just doesn't like New Orleans, huh?  That is a real.  Did you see that track that Danny?  That's pretty cool.  Where was that?  That's a cool track, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  It's on weather.com.  But you see how it just kind of avoided everything just to get in the Gulf?  It did kind of skirt around Cuba and like.  It just skirted and stepped to the side when it had to.  Look at that.  Nope.  Yeah, we want to do this.  Just when it's about to hit the tip of Florida, it moves to the left slightly.  I want to get in here.  Right.  What do you think of Camden?  Camden has decided, you know what?  We don't need police.  We got to save some money.  Camden trying to save some cash. 
[01:00:00]  Well, it's a union busting thing.  Yeah, definitely.  Is that what it is?  Union busters.  Yep.  Remember, was it a year or two that same shit was going down?  Yeah, yeah.  They laid off half the force.  Half the force.  They hired them back after some.  And remember all the locals were celebrating with their t-shirts?  What were the t-shirts?  We did a whole break on that.  They were very happy there were no police in Camden.  Right.  Yeah.  Camden is, for the rest of the country, a shithole.  Yeah.  It is a crime-ridden... 
[01:00:30]  Except for that outdoor stadium.  Yeah, yeah.  Where we did the virus show.  Tweeter Center.  Tweeter Center.  Thank you.  Crime-infested...  I always imagine Camden like Detroit, like RoboCop's Detroit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I always think of it like that.  Man, you go over that bridge down there and you're on your own.  Yeah, yeah.  The Tweeter Center is close to the bridge, but that's it.  You gotta be careful.  I did a gig at Rutgers-Camden because there's a division there with...  You got Rutgers over there?  Oh, yeah.  Rutgers and Camden.  Many years ago, it was me, Otto, and George at a local black comic. 
[01:01:00]  Wasn't good.  No, huh?  No, I mean, they weren't a crazy crowd.  It was a college crowd, but they're just, you know, just a black crowd and they just  didn't enjoy the kid.  Camden's very black.  Is it?  If you didn't know that by what I had prefaced the whole thing with.  A lot of what they call violence going on in Camden.  And now they're getting rid of the cops for some financial and union-busting reasons.  Then they bring in some county police or some shit. 
[01:01:30]  It's not like there's going to be the Wild West where there's no cops in there.  They got some kind of other cops.  Yeah, but the other cops really, would you really, you know...  I wouldn't give a shit.  You wouldn't pay too much attention.  No.  You would do the bare minimum, right?  I'd like to see what's going to happen.  Huh?  You think there's going to be some action?  What other action could they have?  I know.  It's just a disaster.  They've already pretty much destroyed that area.  It really is.  Right?  Is that the demo?  What's the demo? 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  Oh, wow.  What is it?  47% Hispanic and 44.3% black.  Where's the white people?  There's actually a dot.  There's one white person.  White is 4.9%.  You have to be just dumb to be white in that area.  And Asian is 2.1%.  That's dumb, too.  And they run 100% of the stores. 
[01:02:30]  Why would you live there?  See?  Why would you live there?  I don't know.  Poor man.  Maybe you're broke.  You've got to be broke.  Those are the poor areas.  Yeah, you would think, right?  Do we have any pictures of Camden?  I've been, like we said, the Tweeter Center, but I don't have any real memories of spending  any time in Camden.  Well, there's no reason.  You'd be in trouble in Camden.  Yeah, that looks nice.  That's by Rutgers, right?  We want to see some horrid areas of Camden.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not the parts that are on their fucking pamphlet.  You know, don't go to CamdenSmile.com. 
[01:03:00]  Camden Tourism.  Come to Camden.  I wonder what you get if you put Camden Tourism.  You go to the search.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  That's right out of the wire.  That looks like where they were hiding the bodies in the wire.  Right.  What's that sign say?  Rest in peace.  We love Ed, a.k.a.  Fat Boy.  Yo, Fat Boy.  Bob.  Shit.  Fat Boy.  Got it.  That's not a D.  That's an R-O-C-K.  Yeah, that looks more like the Camden we know and adore. 
[01:03:30]  Wow, look at this.  Oh, man.  Everything's just boarded up.  How the fuck does it get like that?  How do you fix that, man?  How do you fix it?  How does it get like that?  Why do you fix it?  Why would you fucking invest money to fix that when it's just going to turn into shit again?  No.  There's just no.  A lot of flowers on the sidewalk.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of murals.  Murals and murals.  Wow, that's really bad.  You don't fix that. 
[01:04:00]  What do you do?  You should bulldoze it down.  Yeah, but then you get people kind of annoyed.  I don't know how...  Let me see that apartment building there above right there.  We're just looking at apartment building.  And it all looks so desolate.  It doesn't look like projects in New York.  No.  There's giant buildings together and 50 people.  It's just isolated.  And it all looks abandoned.  It looks really scary.  Everything else has been burnt down.  There's just abandoned row houses with boards over the windows.  Wow. 
[01:04:30]  Crack houses.  That's terrible.  Where's the commercial area?  Where's that commercial area?  Or put tourism in.  I want to see what comes up if you put Camden tourism.  Let me see what happens.  Travis was telling me their actual city website has reasons to live there.  It's a great place.  Diversity?  They have a whole...  I just linked, Danny.  They have a whole video tour book, like quality of life and economics.  Oh, great.  I would assume one of the reasons is you don't have to pay a bill ever.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  That would be good, right?  No bills.  No bills.  What are they going to do?  Great place to open a bullet store.  Look, sometimes you just got to give up.  Why are they trying to get people to move into Camden?  It's over, Johnny.  Like candy?  It's over.  You want to watch the quality of life video?  Yeah.  Here's the Camden quality of life.  This is a city in 1828.  Camden has approximately 80,000 residents  and is situated between two waterways, the Delaware and Cooper Rivers.  It's a city steeped in a wonderfully diverse blend of ethnic and religious traditions  handed down by generations of European immigrants. 
[01:05:30]  Camden is a community of families and businesses working together  to promote an outstanding quality of life  and where everyone can receive an excellent education.  This is the pop of Canada, man.  First-rate health care is available, recreational activities abound,  and housing is affordable.  In Camden, you'll find residents who volunteer their time to actively participate  in organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of Camden,  the United Way, and the Symphony in C.  And when it's time to have fun in Camden, 
[01:06:00]  recreational and entertainment attractions are almost limitless.  Whether you're a family or a business on the move,  Camden invites you to come visit.  On the move.  That means drug dealers.  Yeah, you do.  You don't want to leave.  I love the tight shots.  They found a couple little areas that still look okay,  but if they zoomed out, you know there's a world of hurt right around the corner.  Oh, that sounded like a great place.  Recreation and things to do, please.  Oh, yes.  Yes, in Camden.  Run for your life. 
[01:06:30]  A place that no longer has a police department officially.  Welcome to Camden, New Jersey.  This guy's got to blow his nose first of all.  Where some of the most extraordinary adventures take place,  like an opportunity to visit a West African river with hippopotamuses,  crocodiles,  That's right.  I'm being chased by natives of that country.  Or the chance to swim with the sharks at the $60 million Adventure Aquarium, you can.  And that's just the beginning of things to do and fun to be had in Camden.  Each year, hundreds of thousands of people are attracted 
[01:07:00]  to the city's Delaware River waterfront,  a world-class destination that includes the Battleship New Jersey,  the most decorated, fastest, and longest battleship in U.S. Naval history,  and the Camden Children's Garden,  a facility specifically geared to our young visitors.  And for a change of pace,  there's fine dining on the beautiful waterfront at Victor's Pub,  a game of tennis,  a nature walk in one of Camden's outstanding parks,  a visit to the Rutgers Camden Center for the Arts, 
[01:07:30]  or a concert at the Susquehanna Bank Center.  If you're looking for fun and adventure,  welcome to Camden.  That's all right on the waterway.  There you go.  Oh, Jesus.  They ruined it with an Uzi.  That's right on the waterway.  That's not the actual neighborhood.  Yeah, stop already.  They squeezed a lot of shit right on the banks of the Delaware.  You think they were doing tight shots?  Oh, my God.  Tight shots.  All around.  If you're looking for a place that's raising a family, 
[01:08:00]  choose Camden.  Camden.  I hate that guy with his dumb nose.  It's all clogged up.  It's all coked out, yeah.  There's some propaganda, though.  Holy fuck.  How do they sell Camden to people?  That's the 5% white people that fell for it.  Sounds like a wonderful place.  Yeah.  The state of New Jersey has been in charge of the Camden police force  since 2005 at the request of then-Mayor Gwendolyn,  who was in conflict with the department. 
[01:08:30]  Governor Christie said the transition will actually provide a huge increase  in the number of police officers on the street of Camden.  I'm willing to put my name on the line for this concept, he declared,  during an event at the Rutgers Camden University.  Good for him.  So there will be police.  It's just what?  The po-po.  It's not going to be the local Camden police department, I guess.  Good for them.  That just looked scary.  Yeah, see, thank you, Bill, in Jersey, who knows a lot more about this. 
[01:09:00]  That video was very suspicious.  Bill, go ahead.  Hello, Bill.  I grew up in South Jersey, and I went to Rutgers Camden.  Good for you.  Thanks, Jim.  And everything that they're saying is in one geographically isolated area of Camden.  Yeah, it's all just right on the waterfront.  Like, literally, you go over the bridge, take a right, and you stay in that area.  Exactly.  It's guarded by the bridge and the waterfront,  and so that's where sort of they put all the effort to try to rebuild the city. 
[01:09:30]  If you get on the high-speed line, you know, the train from Jersey into Philly,  you go through more or less the heart of it, and it looks like bombed-out, you know, 1980s Beirut, basically.  Nice.  Baltimore is like that.  When you take the Acceler down to Washington, there's about, what, 10, 15 minutes where it is great viewing out that window.  That's nice.  It's amazing.  Blown-out buildings.  Blown-out buildings, like from the wire.  In the 90s, Admiral Wilson Boulevard, they cleaned it up for the Republican Convention when it was in Philadelphia. 
[01:10:00]  But prior to that, when you were driving in, there would just be, like, row homes with buildings missing because they were burned down,  and the remaining buildings just had, like, flame marks up the sides and stuff like that.  It really wasn't that bad until they knocked all that down.  They board the windows up, and then they paint windows on the boards to kind of pretty it up a little bit.  Who did that?  They've done that in some horrid areas where they've had to board up buildings.  I know they used to do it in... 
[01:10:30]  In the Bronx.  In the Bronx, yeah.  On the Cross-Bronx Expressway, you'd be driving, and you'd see all these blown-out buildings, you know, boarded up,  but then they would start painting, like, windows and stuff with little flower pots.  I remember that.  All boarded up.  It's like, yeah, maybe no one will notice.  But you know what?  It shows that you can turn it around because now when you do that Cross-Bronx Expressway,  you don't see the boarded-up buildings anymore.  That goes way back when we were growing up.  But this is what it takes.  It takes somebody like Giuliani. 
[01:11:00]  It takes a village.  It takes someone like Giuliani to come in and really fucking start cracking heads.  Yeah.  Because that's what he did.  And if you notice, that's when these burnt-out buildings came down.  They started building other things.  Companies came in, and New York became like a place where people wanted to come in and spend money.  Companies also.  So that shit was not happening back in the 80s, early 90s.  It was really bad.  Yep.  You were afraid to drive through, like, the Bronx, even on the highway. 
[01:11:30]  If your car broke down, it was fucking getting stripped.  Period.  Well, you left it.  Remember all the broken-out cars you would see?  All over the place.  Sometimes completely stripped.  Not even the top.  Nothing left.  Totally stripped out.  Hey, can we look up house prices for Camden?  We like doing that.  Yeah, we did that for Detroit.  It's a little realty.  Maybe we want to buy a house.  I want to buy a house in Camden.  I'd like to get a second house here.  You don't fuck buying Apple stock, Anthony.  I think this is where you've got to invest your money.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Real estate in Camden.  Estimated median house or condo value in 2009. 
[01:12:00]  In Camden?  In Camden.  $92,900?  $92,000.  Oh, and for Jersey, on the whole, it's $348,000.  I guess they're up from $40,800 into the year 2000.  See?  That would have been a great investment.  Good investment.  If it was still standing.  Didn't we see houses in Detroit going for like $1,000 or something crazy like that?  A fixer-upper. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Good luck to the people in Camden.  That sounds like they're turning it around.  Yeah, yeah.  They're turning it around.  A little bit.  I don't know.  You need somebody that really is going to wield an iron fist, not just back down to interest  groups that are pissed that you're fucking with their group.  You know how much shit Giuliani used to go through with the homeless and the fucking squeegee  guys and everything?  And he just said, go fuck yourself. 
[01:13:00]  Because, yeah, we're fucking quality of life laws he would start enforcing.  Those squeegee guys went bye-bye.  You don't miss those guys?  No, they were fucking annoying.  We're coming from Long Island.  They were kind of fun to see the first few times.  But after a while, it just got like, fuck, get out of here.  They would aggressively approach your car.  Yeah.  And they'd start squeegeeing it off.  And they're not doing a good job.  They would reach in your windows and try to grab whatever they can sometimes. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  I used to throw the money out the window.  To see.  I think you were in the car once.  I crumbled up.  I'd crumble up like a dollar.  Yeah.  And just kind of throw it into the breeze.  Yeah.  And watch him have to run through traffic to get it.  Like right when the light turned green.  Because it would be red and he'd come up to get the cars.  So I'd be like, buddy, buddy.  And it would turn green.  I'd throw the dollar into traffic.  And he'd be like running through the cars trying to get his dollar.  His dollar.  And he might have gotten hurt.  Fuck him.  Fuck him in his funky ass. 
[01:14:00]  They were providing a need and a service.  A lot of times after going through the tunnel, I would love to have my windows cleaned.  Oh, I bet.  A young gentleman in a uniform with dirty water.  Brian, what's up?  He wants to tell us something we don't know about Camden.  Oh, cool.  What's up, Brian?  Brian, what do you got on Camden?  What's happening?  Yeah, there's the Admiral Wilson Boulevard.  It's like the main strip that goes from Route 130 to...  What is it called?  I want to get it on Street View.  Admiral Wilson Boulevard.  Admiral Wilson.  Oh, Admiral. 
[01:14:30]  Admiral Wilson.  Admiral Wilson.  Yeah, it used to be a highway full of strip clubs and bars, and they had so many killings  and murders down there that they just hold everything to the ground and made it a park.  Make a park out of it.  Oh, is it a park now?  Yeah, it's all just nothing but park.  And they got tent cities where people, they're just all homeless people living down there in  tents.  Sounds great.  Shantytowns. 
[01:15:00]  What a disaster.  Yeah, it seems like who the hell wants to be the mayor of Tent City, right, guys?  Well, I was actually born in Camden back in the 60s, and it wasn't too bad back then  growing up.  You know, you could go down there and hang out and...  Go down there.  Well, that's for everybody.  That big Philly accent you can hear, right?  Go down there, hang out.  Go down there, hang out.  What's going on?  Have a lolly.  What was the word that you said?  The Philly word that was weird?  Oh, they say lollies.  Give me a lolly. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, no, taffies.  For lollipop?  For lollipops.  Ew, give me a taffy?  Yeah.  Ew.  That stinks.  That's so stupid.  And a crayon is a crown.  A crown?  Cryon.  No, crown.  Crown.  Crown.  A crown.  Cran.  That's just a perversion of the word crayon.  And they say water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  It's the worst accent in the country.  Hoagie?  No, they say hoagie pretty normal, but they say water. 
[01:16:00]  Water.  They all say water really weird down there.  Water.  Yeah.  Oh.  Taffy's a lollipop.  Taffy.  Yeah, you want a taffy?  What?  No, I don't.  It's a lollipop.  Give me a lollipop.  Taffy's something different.  Who says taffy?  I want a lollipop.  They're not called the taffy kids.  No.  The lollipop, right?  Guild.  Whatever the fuck they were.  It's called a lollipop.  It is.  Because you want to, you know what it is?  You're lollying around in your mouth and then you pop it out of your mouth. 
[01:16:30]  You pop it in.  And you show it to people.  It lollygags on your hand and you pop it in your mouth and then more lollying.  What's better than sucking on a lollipop and then slapping somebody's cheek and getting  their cheek sticky with your lolly?  Look at that homeboy fixing his car.  That alley probably has seen a lot of shit.  We're looking at Street View here.  Of a lovely neighborhood.  So, Brian, what changed?  You said it was really good in the 60s.  It used to be a lot of white people live down there. 
[01:17:00]  Say it.  Down there.  I know you got it in.  Yes, say it.  Say it.  A lot of cities where black people have moved in and have been there for years have turned  to shitty cities.  It's just the way it is.  I don't know why.  I don't know what the reason is.  But you're going to tell me it's not?  My parents used to live while we grew up in Pensacola, which is right outside of Camden.  And they moved out because it's all Camden. 
[01:17:30]  Could you show me a predominantly black city or township that is doing well?  Atlanta.  What?  Yeah, parts of Atlanta.  Great.  Parts of Atlanta?  Yeah.  But are those the white parts?  No.  Like where are...  No, Atlanta is a very, very black city.  And they have a lot of black communities that are doing very, very well.  Really?  Yes, I'm telling you.  I'm sorry that I had to answer your question.  No, no. 
[01:18:00]  I'm glad you did.  But honestly, after Atlanta, I couldn't give you a second one.  I'm going to have to look at that.  I know Atlanta is doing very well.  Not the...  You know, they got their problem areas like any other city, but they have a lot of black  areas that are doing very well.  And is it predominantly?  Yes.  Atlanta is a black city, yeah.  Atlanta is a big time black city.  All right.  Yep.  I'm a-looking.  Sorry.  No, don't be sorry.  I'm glad.  I'm glad to be proven wrong in those instances.  It helps my hope.  Or maybe someone could give us a second one. 
[01:18:30]  It helps my hope for this nation.  That's where I'm at.  I couldn't name another one.  Yeah.  Where it's predominantly black doing very, very well.  I'm sure there's plenty of areas.  We just don't know that they're predominantly black.  I'm on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Southwest.  Oh.  Nice.  Where?  Camden?  No, in Atlanta.  Oh, Atlanta.  Nice.  Yeah.  Oh, let's take a little drive.  I don't see any problems.  It looks nice.  This might be the first Martin Luther King Boulevard that looks okay.  You never want to see that in the directions when you're going to a gig.  I don't know.  You make a left on Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[01:19:00]  It's the third store.  Oh, no.  This could be the one to get where?  We have found an anomaly.  We're on a Martin King Boulevard, and it looks all right.  The MLK.  MLK.  Is there an MLK in almost every city at this point?  I would think so.  Yeah.  All right, Brian.  What else you got?  That's it?  Yeah, that's all.  All right.  That's good for now.  All right.  This guy's a quick Camden story.  Then we can move on.  Paul in Jersey.  What's going on, guys?  And someone's saying we're a little off about Atlanta, so I'm going to go to that guy for you. 
[01:19:30]  Go ahead, Paul.  Yeah, Morgan Boulevard, which is right in the absolute dump of Camden next to Gloucester City.  We have to go down that road before we go to the Marine Terminal for work, and there's like an alleyway there of strippers, excuse me, hookers, that would go after, like, the out-of-town truck drivers.  And we came down there one morning, and the methadone bus was pulling up, and there was a passed-out hooker.  And the best way I could describe her is she was crawling down the railroad tracks like Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump with no legs. 
[01:20:00]  And that is just basically describes all you need to know of Camden.  Scary.  Good place.  Good place.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Yeah, Buckhead.  Buckhead.  It was all black.  Rap stars live there.  It's super expensive.  I remember Buckhead, and it wasn't black when we went there.  Well, the bar scene and all that.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's probably changed over the years.  Let's say hi to John Utah in Atlanta. 
[01:20:30]  That's weird.  What's up, John Utah?  Good morning, fellas.  There's an area where Tyler Perry lives, and that's going to up the property value.  Atlanta is a big suburb, but there are areas you ever get scared during the day?  You're going somewhere, and you get a little terrified to turn around in a certain area in broad daylight.  Sure.  There are lots of areas like that down here.  It's a big suburb.  This city sucks.  Move back to New York or L.A.  This is not a city.  You can't walk anywhere. 
[01:21:00]  You have to drive.  So those areas you're going to be driving through.  So you're never going to have to go through it, just so you know.  Yeah, I'm not saying that Atlanta doesn't have their problem areas, but as far as black areas  that are doing well, Atlanta definitely has a few.  It does.  It does.  But it's few and far between, and anyone who lives in Atlanta should get the hell out.  Well, we were told it was like a mini New York City down there.  Yeah, we were.  We need to move down there.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people moving there from New York.  Well, we weren't trying. 
[01:21:30]  They were trying to get us to move down there to do radio.  No, I moved here from Brooklyn, and you miss what you have up there.  So enjoy your pizza.  Enjoy your walkability.  Enjoy your beautiful women.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Utah, who used to be from New York but now lives in Atlanta.  Atlanta, the city parts are a shithole.  Yeah, I remember that.  The actual city is a little scary.  Atlanta's a shithole. 
[01:22:00]  All right, whatever.  Done with this.  Yeah, it's not a thriving black community.  Who's that guy?  Let's go with him.  Jeff in Atlanta.  I am wrong.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, yeah, I live in Atlanta.  The only areas of Atlanta that are thriving are the white suburbs, like the previous caller  stated.  The city of Atlanta itself, being predominantly black, is a shithole.  There's nothing nice about it.  When you get out of the city of Atlanta, no white people live in the city of Atlanta. 
[01:22:30]  Sure, there are pockets here and there, but it's extremely wealthy pockets of people  that are trying to move back into the city.  But in general, if you go to a predominantly black area of Atlanta, you are scared shitless.  You avoid it like the plague.  Yeah, I say those things and people get mad at me.  I don't know.  No, but that's the truth.  I've lived here forever.  It's just that's not the case.  There are a lot of black people in Atlanta.  That doesn't make it nice.  Could you name for me...  ...in the other suburbs?  Well, the name for me, like even, is there a, I mean, government-controlled and predominantly 
[01:23:00]  black population, business owners, all that, where it's a prosperous area?  And I'm talking, now I'll give you the opportunity to give it to me fucking globally.  Is there a nation that runs well, that is strictly black government and black population?  I don't know.  Is there? 
[01:23:30]  Seems like we're always shoveling aid over to those nations.  I'm sure there are.  I'm sure there's...  Uganda, South Africa's not doing well.  As truck drivers, we avoid Atlanta.  So, you know what, Ann?  There you go.  Oh.  I remember when we were taking the drive.  This story's been told, but whatever.  We went down there for an interview, and we were coming from the airport to the radio  station, wherever the fuck we were going.  I have no idea, but we were on a highway.  Remember, all traffic stopped because of Freaknik?  Yeah.  And people started dancing all over the fucking place. 
[01:24:00]  Frightening.  They just decided to have an impromptu party on the highway as part of the Freaknik festivities.  Are you uncomfortable in those situations, Ann?  Yeah.  Very uncomfortable.  Were you uncomfortable with everyone dancing on their cars and shit?  Yes.  I thought that was fun to watch.  Yeah.  It's always fun until you're getting dragged out like fucking Reginald Denny.  Your old fucking toilet bowl head.  I was thinking, wow, this is something you don't see every day.  I kind of like that.  It certainly isn't. 
[01:24:30]  Got to keep your guard up.  People wonder why I asked that.  I'm just...  I'm very curious as to know, like...  Like, because a lot of things in America, it's blamed on racism and slavery and all that bullshit and whatnot.  But...  Worldwide, there'd have to be a different reason, wouldn't there?  I don't know.  I want one very prosperous, industrious, modern nation.  By the way, thanks to the fans, because they pointed out that my Toronto gig, the theater's going out of business. 
[01:25:00]  So I had to tell my fucking...  I told my agents, you know, because the people on Twitter...  Oh.  I appreciate the Twitter people helping me.  It's good that nobody on my side knew that.  That knew that it was going out of business?  Yeah, it's good.  When is it going out of business?  Before my gig.  So I'll be moving it.  Oh, no.  Yep.  So thank you to the very...  I appreciate the fans for chiming in with some helpful stuff. 
[01:25:30]  Since nobody on the team caught it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Good thing for the Twitter people.  You'd have looked silly driving up to that place.  Oh, my God.  We've been a comedy of errors.  Comedy of errors.  Yes.  You guys want to take a chance with a suggestion from a listener?  Sure.  Oh, boy.  We were talking about Philly, and this guy says...  Give it a try.  We have to play Philly Guy at Water Park.  Have you ever heard this one, Danny, or seen this one?  Oh, no.  But then I did a little search on my little iPad here, and it looks like Ron Efez played this 
[01:26:00]  and commented on it.  Oh, yeah?  So maybe...  I mean, Ronnie knows good.  Ronnie knows good, right?  Oh, yeah.  Let me see what this is real fast.  They say it's hilarious.  There you are.  Mike, it's time to get out of the water, bud.  Water.  Water.  You've been in the water all day, man.  Let's go.  Get out of the water.  I know, I know, but you've got to get out of the water.  I mean, it's time.  You're starving.  You've got to eat something.  You know?  Let's go back to the house.  Let's get a hoagie in you.  All right?  Sound good?  Give you a nice cheesesteak if you get out of the water. 
[01:26:30]  Nice.  Get out of the water.  Get out of the water.  I need you to get out of the water.  Come on.  I'm not kidding around here.  I know you're having a good time, but I'm starving here, Mike.  Just get out of the water.  Now.  They do say water.  Now.  Horribly.  Now.  You're killing me, bud.  You're killing me, bud.  What do I have to do to get you out of the water?  Get out of the water.  Sorry.  You won't get out of the water.  Get out of the water.  Please get out of the water.  Now I'm begging you. 
[01:27:00]  Now I'm begging you.  You got to get out of the water.  Did you hear me yelling for you?  I told you to get out of the water.  It's water.  Not water.  I hope you know you look like an idiot when you say it like that.  You embarrass me.  Let's go home.  That's what I said.  I said get out of the water.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Wait.  What's the next one?  And the boat.  Mike.  I'm going to catch the last two innings in a Phillies game.  Let's go.  Get out of the boat. 
[01:27:30]  Boat.  Get out of the boat.  What?  That's pretty funny.  They do say go weird, too.  That's right.  Go.  Go.  Water.  That's an old one.  Water is the one I've always noticed ever since I started hanging out there with the gang.  Water.  Water.  Water.  It's terrible.  All right.  We should break against some other things.  Certainly.  All right.  Indubitably.  Ryan Starr is coming in today. 
[01:28:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  He's very talented, man.  Yes, he is.  He's been doing our show for years, and he's finally blowing up.  Yeah, I'm happy for him.  He should have blown up years ago, but it's finally happening for this kid.  He was on Leno with you recently, right?  He was, yeah.  Damn.  I had a mediocre segment, but he was very good.  He's very talented, Ryan Starr.  So, is he going to play something for us today?  I think so.  Very cool.  Serious, Serious, XM's.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:28:30]  So, we're going to take a few days off.  Anybody doing anything cool?  You're just hanging?  Every day.  Doing a staycation?  I'm just going to fucking hang around my groovy pad, swim in my pool, drink some beers, and fucking hang out. 
[01:29:00]  I'm really bummed I'm not doing the Outer Banks this year.  I love going down there.  I love going to the 4x4 beach and just renting those ridiculous houses that are very affordable.  I'm not going this year, eh?  No, man.  Don't you go to fucking Louisiana?  No, man.  Get yourself a hurricane.  How about Camden?  There's some lovely places.  Camden.  If you'll watch that fucking promo, it's pretty good.  I want to do stupid shit in and around New York that I've never done.  Oh.  I want to get lazy. 
[01:29:30]  When we have a few days off and I don't go away, I just get lazy and go, wow, you just wasted three days, you idiot.  So, you're going to go to the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty?  I've never been to the top of the Empire State Building.  You joke, but maybe I should just do that.  I have a guy that wants to give me a private tour of the Statue of Liberty.  You've got to do that, dude.  Al-Qaeda.  You've got to put this belt on.  It's one of Brewer's guys.  He's real close with Brewer.  He's like, look, I'm, I don't know, he's doing the construction or there's a construction project there, right?  It's not really, is it open to the public?  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  It always is.  But he said, give me the inside tour.  That's the shit I want.  Inside tour shit.  You know, when I went to Alcatraz, I saw those, those, those hallways or whatever that are blocked off.  But you know, people go down there.  That's the shit I want to do.  Not the one that like, you know what, this is good enough for tourists.  I want, I want to go deep into some of this shit.  I like the touristy stuff.  I like seeing the, uh.  But that's what, the beauty of having a radio show, we're lucky.  We get some of these inside tours.  Like you did St. Quentin. 
[01:30:30]  Kenny and I, if it wasn't for the chicken pox outbreak, we would have been walking around the cell block.  It's unfortunate that there was a big outbreak of the chicken pox.  So how about people help me out?  I got five days in and around New York.  I want to do crazy shit that people don't get to do.  You know, just get a hold of me on Twitter.  Take a dubstep class.  Do something completely awful.  See you dubstepping all over.  One of the dumb things I want to do is go up the Hudson River.  Oh.  You ever desire to just go up the Hudson River and see, and go far though. 
[01:31:00]  In a boat, you mean?  Yeah, like go up a couple, you know, in a boat for a couple days.  Do they do that?  Days?  No, you'd be in Canada.  You're like Lewis and Clark there or something.  How long would it take?  Henry Hudson.  How long would it take to do New York to Canada up the Hudson River?  I don't know.  I don't need to go that far.  Is there a block in the waterway?  With a waterway?  Water?  Water.  Water.  How fast is your boat?  Water.  Make it up there pretty quick if you will.  I jumped into the Orca one time and we took it around.  And then I was in my pool and there was a shark. 
[01:31:30]  And I was saving all the people from the shark in my pool.  Smile, you son of a bitch.  Little Jimmy Norton voice.  No dignity had been sent.  Yes.  We didn't know.  No sleep signals had been sent.  No chin had been sent.  I know what would happen with the Hudson River thing within, what, 12 hours? 
[01:32:00]  You're like, all right, enough of this stupid river, right?  Oh, you probably would.  It sounds like kind of cool on paper.  You have a bird's shit on you under the Tappan Z.  You're like, all right, I'm going for this.  You can sell up to Troy on the Hudson.  How long does that take?  Troy?  I don't know.  Oh, Troy.  Oh, Troy.  I've never sailed it.  Yeah.  I had a sailboat when I was a kid.  No, you didn't.  Did you?  Yeah.  Of course not.  I just wanted to always see what that felt like to say.  I'm already planning my next summer's vacation. 
[01:32:30]  Where are you going?  Like spring, summer, because I'm kind of done with the cruise thing for a while.  I've done enough of them and stuff.  I'm not like E-Rock, where that chocolate fucking buffet just freaks them out.  It entices you.  Oh, it enticed me.  It doesn't entice you anymore.  Here it is.  Fucking rent a Mac Daddy motorhome.  Yes.  New York to L.A.  Yes.  With stops all over the place and then fly back.  And I'm talking fucking all the cool places.  Yes.  All those cool Americana jerks and little shitholes. 
[01:33:00]  And the fucking Southwest, the deserts, the fucking old atomic facilities.  Like, I want to see all that shit.  And you'll drive?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  As soon as you get out of New York into Pennsylvania, you can drive those fucking things.  Just barreling down.  That's exactly what I want to do.  Take a fuckload of rifles with me.  Would you go to Grand Canyon?  Yeah, probably would.  Gotta go Grand Canyon.  I probably would.  I think I would go north, like middle, north maybe to go see the Badlands. 
[01:33:30]  You gotta go north and then come back south.  Rushmore and stuff.  And then take the south turn.  And then dip.  Dip down.  And then you cut across the southwest.  I did a lot of wandering while we were off the air.  And that's one thing I regret.  That I didn't just jump in my car and go across the country.  Really?  Yeah, man.  What else were we doing?  No, no, no.  I mean, you were still driving that far.  You were lucky.  We weren't allowed to do shit.  To drive that far would freak me out.  But it's cool with like a motorhome.  You could just stop at weird places.  You could just stop and fucking sleep in your motorhome.  Yeah.  Pretty cool. 
[01:34:00]  It'd be nice.  I'm talking about a fucking nice one.  You know what?  Where it's like got a bedroom and kitchen in front.  We should get...  Hills have eyes shit.  Hear me out.  Hear me out.  Uh-huh.  We should get three motorholes.  Oh, no.  Mine will be me and my family.  You, God knows.  I'll have a party.  It'll be a rolling fucking party on mine.  And then Jimmy just filled with a bunch of trannies.  It'll be...  Sorry.  You look at the window.  You'll see all like...  It'll look like fucking Jane Gumshaus. 
[01:34:30]  Moths flying around.  Moths and the hiss of CPAP machines.  CPAP.  CPAP and a lady stands up.  I am.  Are you going to see...  Because she's a man.  She's pappy.  Clubs said Kenny would drive Jimmy's motorhome.  Why?  Yeah.  Because he'd take him.  I'll be cooking mess up in mine.  Because he would want to.  He would want to take care of you.  He likes taking care of you.  Is that true?  Yes.  Okay.  Will you drive Jimmy's motorhome across America? 
[01:35:00]  I probably should ask Kenny's here.  Come on.  Let's do this.  And can we broadcast?  Maybe we don't even get to take...  We don't have to take vacation.  Did I not just say this the other day?  I said that we should...  Yes.  He certainly did, G.H.  We were talking on the way home and I said we should all do something.  Not necessarily talking about tour buses.  Yeah.  Or something where we all go to different places and do some kind of a weird stop thing like that.  I just said this to him the other day on the way home from fucking New Hampshire.  But imagine, like, in between radio shows, you're taping whatever shit's going on in your motorhome or RV, whatever. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then the next day, it's like, okay, where are we stopping to do the show?  Right.  And we fucking stop.  We could actually...  Audio and visual.  Dude, you could actually...  We could just pull out one of our dumb phones and do it.  It'd be easy.  That's where the technology is gone.  It'd be really fucking...  Wow, that's a hell of a tour bus.  I wouldn't want a...  Is that a tour bus?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, look at these things.  Let me see that.  That's a tour bus?  That's hilarious.  How much is it to rent that?  Like, just for an hour?  Oh, God.  An hour?  Just around the block.  I don't know. 
[01:36:00]  That's a lot of money.  They store it at $1,000 a day.  Oh, okay.  Store that?  So you could...  Yeah.  That's not bad.  Got a real nice one.  Fuck it.  Yeah, because I was thinking of that.  Something with, you know, satellite TV.  Get all my sat phones so I could, you know, communicate and just go into the fucking wilderness.  Bring the drone with me so I could fly that around the desert.  Why don't we...  Piss her!  Why wait till next?  Lots of guns!  Lots of guns!  I could bring rifles, Kenny.  That's my right.  Pistols, I have to leave, you know, have to leave back here at the ranch. 
[01:36:30]  You gotta get a Class A commercials license.  Rifles, shotguns.  Oh, you gotta get a Class A license?  Class A commercial...  For one of those big ones.  Class A license for a Class D person?  Why wait till next summer?  Because that's kind of what I want to do.  I want to really plan it nice.  If we re-sign with this joint, why don't we do it like...  In the winter?  Yeah.  Let's go over to the Rockies in the winter.  So you skid out and fucking... 
[01:37:00]  I guess you're right.  Kathy Bates picks you up.  Is there enough shit on the southern route, though, that we could do this?  It still gets nasty weather in there in the winter.  I guess you're right.  I'm definitely planning on a late spring kind of a jaunt.  I think it'd be cool.  I know, and I want to go through a certain place in Missouri, which has a giant brain tumor  made of molasses.  And you can nibble on it. 
[01:37:30]  Everyone gets the nibble on it.  Yes, you do it for nibble.  It's the nibble away at cancer charity.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  A big molasses.  Oh, my God.  Get it fucking out of your mind.  I love it.  You know what a bust that would be?  A fucking...  Like a tumor made of molasses?  It's fucking 16 hours out of the way, both ways.  It's just, oh, we're finally here.  Here it is.  Some old hick.  Just points at it.  There it is.  Nibble.  Numb, numb, numb, numb, numb, numb. 
[01:38:00]  Nibble on it.  Nibble on it.  Why was molasses so important?  Because molasses sucks.  It was sweet.  People loved it.  It stinks.  Have you ever had it?  It's horrible.  Yeah, the Amish love it, those fucking puppy killers.  They kill puppies?  Yeah, they run the puppy mills.  They're terrible.  I hate the Amish.  Bastards.  They don't kill them.  It's torture, though.  They don't want a couple of turks.  Abusive lives.  A couple of fucking tortures.  But how else do you get a cute puppy?  Just buy it from a breeder. 
[01:38:30]  But they have puppy mills, which are torturous.  So what do we do about that?  Can we come in and save the puppies?  Yeah, I say just boycott them.  Yeah.  Boycott.  Fuck the Amish.  Wow.  How much are those renting for, Dan?  Damn.  Are they showing rent?  Dan's looking at all these buses.  Yeah, I mean, rentals is...  Look at that thing.  $362,000.  Yeah.  I just buy one cash.  I'm kidding, people.  Why would you want to buy one?  I would never buy that.  I know.  Why would you buy one?  You asked that to be in a park in my garage in my building?  Why would you buy one?  Because then you'd just sleep on it.  Kevin Smith has his own bus, right? 
[01:39:00]  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  Did he rent it or buy it?  He bought it.  I'm just going to fucking rent a real nice one.  I'm fucking loaded up with fun.  It's going to be packed with fun.  Guns, motorcycles, fucking satellite everything, helicopters, fucking guns, and guns.  Lots of guns.  Oh, and the booze, too.  Can't forget that.  Yeah, but then you drive.  Why don't you hire someone to drive for you?  Drink and drive it. 
[01:39:30]  It's cool.  Once you're out of New York, they love it.  See that thing weaving down the road?  I want to drive one of those.  Yeah.  Some scanners.  But probably after two hours, you're like, all right, someone else drive this.  Yeah, dude, of course.  Maybe I will get a driver.  That big fucking tour bus you showed, Danny, that was awesome.  How much do you think that is a day?  Something like this.  I don't know, man.  No, the tour bus with the inside with the chandeliers.  Oh.  It looked like you were riding the Titanic around.  It really did.  I can't estimate.  It was beautiful.  I know.  I want a friend who's good at estimating. 
[01:40:00]  None of my friends are good estimators.  I've never rented a super luxury tour bus before.  I haven't either.  That's why I need a friend who's a good guesser.  Like, yeah, I'd probably go for it.  Like $1,500 a day right there.  Ah, it's got to be.  I'm guessing like $5,000 a day.  So I'm getting suggestions on my Twitter there because I'm going to try to do things in  and around Manhattan.  Uh-huh.  Go to Ellis Island.  I've never been to Ellis Island.  Oh, that's great.  It's Jason's.  Oh, I was going to say it's named after that idiot from Die Hard. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know who that is.  Hey, Spreckensy.  Spreckensy, Jack.  You know that guy, Ellis from Die Hard?  The dumb guy.  I don't know the guy's name.  Business guy.  I know the character.  If I hadn't seen old Nakatomi Plaza take on on the chin again last night, I might not  remember that either.  And then we got Wayne Alder goes, go to Cooperstown.  I haven't been to the Baseball Hall of Fame in a while.  That seems like it would be boring.  Oh, God, yeah.  But then he goes, use my cabin 15 minutes away.  Uh-oh.  Ugh, yuck.  You wouldn't?  Don't burn it down.  No, I wouldn't. 
[01:41:00]  You wouldn't use the listeners.  You wouldn't use the listeners' home?  Nothing is a listener, but.  Search out the Cheever letters.  I think they're in there.  I should have went to Dubai.  If I knew we were taking off, I just would have, me and Jonathan would have went to Dubai.  A couple of traveling fruits.  That's it.  There's a place called the Yogurt Stop we always go to in fucking Santa Monica Boulevard.  Throw it on your back.  Dude, they really think, because Jonathan, you know, he's such a fucking L.A. creep, and  he wears his sweaters tied around his neck.  Of course he does.  And I'm like, they think that you're the wealthy showbiz gentleman, and that I'm your  hired stud. 
[01:41:30]  I'm your hired cocksman.  Hired cock.  Hey, are we getting that Navy SEAL author still?  Because now there's all sorts of talk about this guy.  Oh, yeah.  When is he coming in?  It looks like September 11th, the day the book comes out.  All right, because U.S. officials review a copy of the Bin Laden raid book.  Author did not submit the book for pre-publication review.  That is required by the military secrecy agreement.  Damn.  And we're going to have him on our show.  Yeah, and according to Saad, he said, I actually sent Saad an email, I haven't heard back from 
[01:42:00]  him, but you know who he had Saad on, and he said that he thinks he is legit.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Wait a minute.  Travis, Pearl Jam is going to be in Philly this weekend?  Yeah, they're doing that Jay-Z Made in America festival.  Where are they playing?  The Ben Franklin Freeway thing?  They're playing at the Ben Franklin Freeway. 
[01:42:30]  They're headlining on Sunday.  Wait, they're not playing where the Phillies play?  No.  Fuck!  That's where my connection is.  Oh, man.  They're playing on a freeway.  Well, no.  You know, like the Ben Franklin Memorial, whatever.  There's like, I guess there's a big park.  We once went to where his house used to be.  It's just a bunch of sticks.  I think it's there.  It's in his house.  It's in his house.  They're playing in his house.  Dude, that fucking place sucked so much.  That was terrible.  Like, I've heard about how...  You weren't with us yet.  No, but I...  You went too?  I went on a different trip.  On like an XM...  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no.  It was for CBS.  We went down to Philly. 
[01:43:00]  And we went there and...  I was so pissed off.  They're like, and this is where the bathroom used to be?  And it's like chalk.  It's just written on the fucking sidewalk.  They put a frame of like metal where the borders of the house were.  There's like plexiglass.  So you can like look into the dirty floor.  Oh, is that the original basement or some shit like that?  Yeah, but like it's just like a depressing...  Yeah, how shitty is America that we let the Ben Franklin fucking house go away?  Yeah, it's just a reminder of all the negligence.  We couldn't figure out how to make sure we save that? 
[01:43:30]  We save everything else in this country.  Yeah.  It might have burned.  You think it might have burned down?  Yeah.  I need to know now because we were so fucking pissed off.  Yeah.  And this used to be his backyard.  What's the difference?  We're in a back...  We're...  Build a replica house or something that you can go inside.  They really should.  Yeah, a replica would have been nice.  They probably have some kind of blueprints they could follow or something.  Because it just doesn't belong.  It's in the middle of the city.  It just doesn't belong there.  And don't you walk down an alleyway or something and then you're just in a lot? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, you barely even...  You can't even do anything, really.  There's nothing around there.  No.  No.  It sucks.  I don't want to go to the U.S. Open.  No.  Ew, look at this.  Look, that's it!  Make that picture bigger.  Let me find a better one.  It's just a frame of a house.  Oh, my God.  How do they get away with that?  Can someone explain what happened to the Ben Franklin house?  You've got to assume it did burn down because that's just ridiculous. 
[01:44:30]  Everything burns down.  This thing, that's where the house is.  Oh, please.  It's made out of like a PVC fence post.  Yeah, yeah.  Fence post.  It's just a shitty fucking frame.  It's not even like a nice sign.  It's barely the frame.  That could have just been black.  Can't even get an ice cream there.  What is that floor you look down into?  I don't know.  I guess it was the original basement.  There's an original picture.  But it's not like in the stone.  I remember it being like almost in dirt.  No, it's where those little things that I saw there or something.  Those raised rock things are.  Is that where it is?  I thought those were just planted. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, maybe they are.  I thought it was.  Yeah, it's like you look down into it.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't remember.  Let's be honest.  Oh, it was.  It was raised.  And you looked down into it.  And you saw like fucking dirt.  Yeah, I looked down.  Let's see Ben Franklin's basement.  Saw where his big fucking loads were shot.  Copy of Black Inches magazine next to a buckled shoe.  Hey, can you get me Pearl Jam tickets, Roland?  No, no.  I know.  I'm not a Bruce.  I don't think I can do anything.  Our connection doesn't take care of that, huh?  Well, it's a festival, though. 
[01:45:30]  But she could take care of Bruce in Philly if I want, right?  Yeah, I'm going.  I want to go Pearl Jam.  How about Pacino on Broadway?  I want to see Pacino.  He's doing something with Bobby Cannavale.  Yeah, I'll cover it.  Yeah.  Oh, is it?  I want to go.  The man with high hair.  And big shoes.  Yeah.  Eddie Vedder might join Bruce on Monday.  Might.  He did it last time.  For what, two songs?  Yeah, that's not that.  That's 10 minutes.  That's good, though. 
[01:46:00]  What'd they sing?  Better Man in Darkness.  That's one.  Who's the bigger rock star, Eddie Vedder or Bruce?  Bruce, I'd have to say.  Bruce.  I do love Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam.  You've got to give that to Bruce.  Right?  Yeah.  Very good.  It's a smorgasbord on Saturday.  I've done again.  Pearl Jam.  You know what?  It's a smorgasbord on Saturday for Opie.  Wait, what?  Smorgasbord.  Smorgasbord?  Smorgasbord.  Isn't that like where fucking the collective go to eat? 
[01:46:30]  Smorgasbord.  I don't want to do that.  Oh, let me have some more.  Resistance is futile.  Can somebody please Photoshop Roland as the Borg?  That's the fucking at the smorgasbord.  He sent it to me immediately.  You want to know what happened to the Ben Franklin house?  I would love to.  Yeah.  All right, then.  Let's say hi to Jim.  I'm sure he's calling somewhere in Philly.  Hi.  I used to be a tour guide in Philly. 
[01:47:00]  The story behind the house was after Ben Franklin and his ancestor, or the people after him died.  I'd say his grandchildren had it.  They turned it into an apartment building.  The building ended up falling into disrepair, and they demolished it.  There were no surviving blueprints.  They have an idea of what it looked like, but they will not rebuild it.  They can't rebuild it to exact specifications, so they won't.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got to slow you down.  Ben Franklin dies, and then the kids are left, and they turn it into a shitty rental?  Yeah.  They turn it into an apartment building. 
[01:47:30]  When does that happen?  Well, what years was that?  Well, that was in, like, the early 1800s.  And, you know, Ben Franklin was rich, but, you know, the people after him, his kids and his grandkids,  he was wildly rich, and they all, like, basically frivoled the money away.  But when you think, if you're Philly, you go, look, all right, we'll take care of the problem here.  We need to save the Ben Franklin house.  I guess they didn't think much of him until years later.  Is that how that works?  Probably.  He's like some guy.  You know, he did a lot of good and shit.  When did he become more than some guy, though? 
[01:48:00]  It takes a while to become a legend.  He was a real celebrity.  He was a big celebrity.  Everybody knew about him.  Yeah, he was a big celebrity.  Philly really wasn't a nice place until relatively recently.  He used to go to fucking France and bang those Frenchies.  Did he?  Yeah.  That's what they say.  He loved them French who is fucking his bald head sticking out from snatch.  I heard he liked going down on women.  That's what the rumor is.  Ben Franklin with his bifocals.  Yeah.  Just looking at that big, hairy French 17, 1800 pussy. 
[01:48:30]  Look up and look in her eyes and look at the pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's just like, oh, look up, look down, look up, look down.  You know, I'm going to have to invent some bifocals.  Bifocals.  I want to be able to see both of these things.  It's very curious that the pussy is always blurry when I'm looking at her face clearly  and vice versa with my spectacles on.  You know, if I could perhaps put a line in my glasses where I could see the woman's face  and her pussy at the same time.  You know, that's an invention. 
[01:49:00]  You know, that's the reason it was invented.  Of course.  But you can't tell the world that.  Ben wanted to see while he was eating pussy.  He loved looking at a big pulsating clit and looking at her eyes roll back in her head.  To make sure she was enjoying it.  Yeah, he was doing the job.  Right.  Or he was fucking her.  So he could make the proper adjustments.  Right.  If need be.  Or he was, she was standing over.  She was bent over and he was fucking her in the ass.  And after he would do that, he would always notice that there were brown stains on his  buckled shoes.  Why? 
[01:49:30]  Why?  But he wanted to know if she was shitting on his buckled shoe.  But he couldn't focus on her asshole and his shoe at the same time.  Right, so he needed the bifocals.  Yes.  And he caught a log falling out and he went, ah-ha!  He originally named him Shitfocals to see the shit.  But then he had to change it.  Yeah.  Because nobody would buy shitfocals.  Of course not.  Shitfocals.  A lot of people also go on to see STP.  STP!  I'll never live that one.  Nah. 
[01:50:00]  And they're saying Scott Weiland's not looking good.  What do you mean?  Do we have any recent video or audio of Scott Weiland?  We haven't talked about him in a while.  He's a wreck.  Or maybe he's got his shit together finally.  What do you think?  I want him.  They're still doing it.  Oh man, he looks like that.  That picture right there that you just had, he looks like the guy from fucking Poltergeist  2.  You're all gonna die!  God is in his holy temple.  That guy was creepy.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Jesus.  Atlanta's very pissed at us, Anthony.  What happened?  Stevens John, while you and the callers poor-mouthed Atlanta, it's a commuter city.  Different from most places you'll go.  Beautiful women, nice weather.  Relax.  Yeah, I kind of like Atlanta.  I'm just trying to make jokes, man.  No one's even fucking saying Atlanta isn't a cool place.  No falcon's helmets had been sent.  No white people had been sent.  Is this recent, Danny? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's not so great, though.  It's hard to hear.  I just don't like the Stone Temple pilots.  No, because they're assholes.  The music just does nothing for me.  Oh, I love SDP's music, absolutely.  I wish I did.  Scott Weiland's just a fucking dick.  Plain and simple, he's just a dick.  Remember, we all had to clear the stage so we could fucking walk on stage? 
[01:51:30]  And we were way off to the side, by the way, for the people wondering.  We weren't anywhere near the action.  But he needed everyone to clear out before he would go on stage.  Fucking prick.  Yeah, fucking prick.  And he stood us up.  He never showed up for the interview.  He's just a lead singer douche.  I think that was the whole reason we went to Boston that time.  Because we were told we'd be able to interview him.  But he was four hours late.  You know, the lead singer.  Yeah, man.  I'm going to do that.  No, that was the K-Rock gig. 
[01:52:00]  Where me and Kenny saw a whole fucking scene go down.  We had that in Boston, too, with him, though.  Yeah, but in Jersey, at the PNC Center there, he was a couple hours late.  Easy, right?  Two hours late?  Well, this was to show up to the gig.  Wasn't he in the trailer the whole time there?  Yeah.  Okay.  And the DeLeo brothers, one of the DeLeo brothers started yelling.  I've told the story, but the quick version.  Started yelling onto the bus.  Come on, Axel.  Come on, Axel.  And then he finally came out.  Yeah, and then called, like, Scott's girl at the time a con. 
[01:52:30]  It was me and Kenny watched.  Kenny, you remember?  Oh, he's gone.  Kenny remembers this.  We were like, holy fuck.  Look, he's giving the thumbs up outside.  It was amazing.  But the best part, come on, Axel.  And he couldn't walk onto Scott's bus.  No, he wasn't allowed to.  Then Scott Weil, the security guy, because he did try to go on the bus, because I forget  which DeLeo brother it was.  He was out of his fucking mind.  And this big, huge security guard comes down the steps of the bus and says, nope, you can't  come on this bus.  Scott will come out when he's ready. 
[01:53:00]  We saw the whole thing go down.  It was amazing.  Imagine your own band not being able to go on and talk to you.  Oh, they don't talk at all.  Well, at the time, they didn't.  That's how I am with Rutgers.  Yeah.  You're going to see that on Friday.  Yeah.  Very late.  I don't let the guys from the band talk to me or anything.  How does he sound here?  Bye-bye. 
[01:53:30]  That's last week.  Pretty good.  Someone saw him last night.  You think at this point, he's just sick of singing these songs over and over again, night  after night.  What goes through your head, you think, up there?  You think he's bored?  Sometimes.  I'm sure.  Sometimes he's bored.  Other times, he's just thinking about what the fuck is the next word of this song.  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  Let's go to Rob, who saw him last night.  Rob. 
[01:54:00]  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Rob.  Yeah, I've seen some of the playoffs played right down the block from FH last night at the  pound-out.  Oh, that's right.  They were in Huntington last night.  Oh, really?  They were on Wednesday also.  Yeah, my brother, I should have told my brother to keep the restaurant open.  Where were they in Huntington?  The Paramount.  They reopened that gym.  Yeah, really?  It was just there.  I saw Primus over there.  How nice is it?  That's nice.  I heard it's beautiful inside.  They redid the whole fucking thing.  They're getting real acts in Huntington.  How big is that?  Pretty cool.  I don't know.  It's been years. 
[01:54:30]  A couple thousand?  Yeah, I can't remember exactly, but it was on the smaller side.  Rob, what?  I said it was packed last night.  No, how many people would you say they could get in there?  It's mostly a floor and it's two lodges.  Oh, not even a thousand.  Fifteen hundred.  Wow.  They're saying fifteen hundred?  That's pushing it, though, right?  Two thousand.  Why are they doing such a small gig?  I just figured I would.  That's where they're at these days.  The Stone Temple Pilots?  Weren't they doing arenas a couple years ago? 
[01:55:00]  More than a couple at this point.  They did PNC, but that was already four years ago?  Yeah.  Five years ago?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that wasn't even, I mean, that wasn't their show.  Yeah, that was also Filter, right?  Filter was there as well?  Well, the crowd has become a lot more intimate.  So you were playing these giant venues and now you're down to fifteen hundred seat arenas.  What do you attribute that to?  Oh, the crowd has become a lot more intimate.  Rob, what did you think?  Were they good?  I thought they were great.  I had never seen them and I was one of those bands, you know, pro jams up there with that, 
[01:55:30]  also bands I never got to see and I was really happy.  They played most of the stuff you wanted to hear them play and, you know, like you guys  always talk about, it was, you know, they went out there, they played the hits, they did  what they had to do, you know.  Oh, good, good for you.  Yeah.  All right, very good.  I was very bummed that FH was closed because that was the first stop and I pulled on the  door and I'm like, what the hell?  Oh, man.  And I started twittering and like, Brett didn't say they were closed tonight and then I realized  you guys are closed every Monday, so. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I think he kept it open Monday for, no one cares about this.  All right, Rob, thank you.  I just realized.  See you Friday, Ant.  All right.  We're talking to like a bunch of countries at this point and I'm explaining that we're  closed Mondays, but sometimes we're not really.  Bob, by the way, Eamon sent me the little revision of the proposal that goes back to them.  You know how that gets batted back and forth?  Yeah.  August 27, 2008.  It's that one. 
[01:56:30]  He goes, yeah, check this out and let me know how it goes.  I'm like, okay, well, that doesn't seem like, well, what?  Who the?  So, did he send you something from four years ago or is the date just wrong?  It's from four years ago because it says one of the cool things in here that we want  to get is a dedicated channel.  What is he fucking doing?  Does he have a brain tumor?  Opian Anthony.  What is he doing?  Yeah.  Call him up on your phone. 
[01:57:00]  That's a great one.  Well, I dropped him a little email there.  He said, what the fuck are you doing?  I was like, excuse me, this is from fucking 2008.  I do like the numbers.  We're in good hands.  Yeah.  I guess that didn't pan out in 2008.  Meh, meh, meh.  Yeah.  I was like, really?  Ah, can I?  He goes, get back to me as soon as possible after you review this.  I'm like, okay.  Wow.  Let me review it.  I'll get back to you in fucking 2009.  I was going to say, you're four years too late. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Said as soon as possible.  Oh, man.  Did I fuck up?  Hey, speaking of music, we got a situation with Penn State.  A situation.  I know, right?  This kind of, you know.  You like this song, man.  You know what?  It's one of my staples.  We might have to play your version into break.  But Penn State will no longer play Sweet Carolina games because of touching you, touching me.  They don't like that line?  I bet you that they don't.  It's not that they don't like the line.  It's probably that they know people are going to mock it and be obnoxious. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  I can begin to know.  And like the way he sings it, it's all very dramatic.  No, it's.  And live, it's different.  It's going strong.  Now he can't even just sing it like this.  He's so bored of it.  Was in the spring.  Ah, but then, then the spring became the summer.  You'd come along.  It's a great fucking party song.  Hands.  Yes.  This is the iffy part. 
[01:58:30]  Hands.  Turn this up, Dennis.  Sandusky's hands.  That's why.  Reaching out.  Fucking me.  He's fucking you.  In my behind.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  Sitting on the 50-yard line. 
[01:59:00]  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  No.  Oh, toodly-o.  And it don't seem so lonely.  We fill it up with all my goo.  This asshole.  Hurtin' runs off my bunghole. 
[01:59:30]  How can I hurt when holding you?  Yes.  Not anymore.  Not a Penn State.  Touchin' Wong.  Reaching out.  You drop the soap.  I'll stick it in you.  Wreck your behind. 
[02:00:00]  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  It's your fault.  It's your fault.  Who is the buddinski at the door?  I hate that red-headed, freckle-faced cock-blocker.  Yeah, I guess then I could be able to play this one, huh?  Yeah.  Seems a little too easy to mock.  Sweet cow. 
[02:00:30]  In my behind.  Your time never sings so good.  Where's Joe?  Where's Joe?  Where's Joe?  Sweet cow.  Joe is blind.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, Jerry's in a bind.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:01:00]  Low shot on my spine.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where is Joe?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Song was for what?  Caroline Kennedy?  Yes.  Yeah, apparently.  So, what, Neil Diamond, basically a pedophile?  Yeah, he saw Caroline Kennedy, a young picture of her, and was inspired to write Sweet Caroline.  How crazy is that?  How old was she?  Eight, nine, ten?  She was 11.  11?  Yay, I wrote a song to John John after he was saluting. 
[02:01:30]  Did you, Uncle Paul?  Sure.  Sweet Johnny Johnny.  Yum, yum, yum.  You put your little hand up at the coffin.  La, la, la, la.  Bounce on my lap.  La, la, la.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[02:02:00]  Get over here.  I'll teach you how to march, touch your toes.  There's a little John John saluting. 
[02:02:30]  Poor little feller.  Yeah.  Yeah, his little white socks.  Looks like he has no pants on.  I love that picture.  Look at him.  Look, he's wearing a little dress.  A little John John temple.  I'm looking for Bobby behind him, like, all right.  Don't worry, Bobby.  Any minute now.  Yeah, Bobby's going, wow.  Thank God my hair is not being mussed up, as it will be in the kitchen.  Whoops, yes.  I think you'd have good hair, the goddamn Kennedys.  Oh, big, full heads of hair to aim at.  Horrible teeth. 
[02:03:00]  Very good.  I tell you one thing.  If you fired into Kennedy's head, it was 100% hit ratio.  That's all you do, aim for the fucking part.  Bitch, it's hair to aim at.  Oh, poor Kennedys.  Hair-seeking bullets.  Can't miss.  Goes around corners.  Big heads of hair on them, all of them.  Look at even John John.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  A little creepy.  Strapped in that seat with the water just fucking waving it back and forth like so much  seaweed.  Old sea urchin head.  There's little guppies poking out from it.  Bloop.  Bloop.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that terrible?  Good hair to aim at.  Oh, my goodness.  Those Kennedys.  Even fucking Teddy.  Yeah.  Someone shot cancer. 
[02:04:00]  Why wouldn't it go there?  It's a nice warm place.  It's covered up with that giant blanket of hair.  Cancer could hide in there.  Hard to like Ted after that fucking chap-a-quitter.  Oh, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That whole thing really put the kibosh on presidential hopes.  You think it fucked it up?  Ruined it.  All right, listen.  We're going to break.  Can we play Anthony doing Sweet Carolina at a live gig?  Why not?  Oh, my God.  I hope I did a good job. 
[02:04:30]  There's a couple versions in there.  It's pretty good.  We'll play that.  And on the other side, I want to talk about Bigfoot.  Did you see the Bigfoot video?  Ew.  What, the guy?  The new Bigfoot video?  Oh, no.  I thought you meant the guy that met with an unfortunate end.  Oh, I got that story, too.  Yeah, we'll talk about him, too.  Oh, you mean...  There's two Bigfoot stories.  Is there a new Bigfoot video, like where it's supposed to be Bigfoot?  Yeah, they see the ladies' foot walker trying to buy shoes.  The video is so...  The video is so fucking fake, but a lot of sites going with it. 
[02:05:00]  You sure it wasn't E-Rock's sneaker?  It was Pigfoot?  I'm misunderstood.  It was Biggut.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to buy a shoe with that big tootsie.  I don't think so.  Get over here, Dolores.  I'm trying to measure his big feet.  He's dropping hairs and berries on me.  Oh, it's Harry and the Hendersons.  Harry.  He's got a little bunch of berries hanging out of his backside.  The little doody berries.  Oh, big matted fucking Bigfoot ass. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, he's so intelligent, is he?  He's got fucking...  It looks like he's sat in pizza.  Oh, don't let him sit on the seats.  Make him stand up in the little foot measure thing.  He's got six inches of cake duty on there.  Looks like a horse's saddle.  Or the Yeti.  Oh, we got two Bigfoot stories.  We'll get into that next.  Yeah.  But first, this.  Here we go, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, people. 
[02:06:00]  God bless you.  God bless you, people.  Where it began, I can't begin to knowin', but then I know it's growin' strong.  Everybody!  Was in the spring.  Everybody!  Then spring became the summer. 
[02:06:30]  Who'd have believed you'd come along?  Everybody!  Hands.  Touching hands.  Nice tits, lady.  Reaching out, touching me, touching you, sweet Caroline, the times never seem so good, I've been inclined to believe they never were. 
[02:07:00]  Best best millionaire I've ever seen.  Now I look in the night.  And it don't seem so lonely.  We fill it up with only two. 
[02:07:30]  Lovely.  And when I hurt, when hurtin' runs off my shoulders, how can I hurt when holding you?  Everybody, how do you want to feel?  Warm.  Touching warm.  Touch my warm cock.  Reaching out.  Touching those tits. 
[02:08:00]  Touching tits.  Sweet Caroline, sweet Caroline, the times have never been so good.  So good, so good, so good.  I've been inclined to believe they never were.  Oh, no, no, no.  A little musical interlude, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  For me to tell you how much I've loved being here.  Talking with everybody.  Singing to you people.  It's a wonderful crowd.  Caroline.  Oh, no, no.  The times never seem so good.  So good, so good, so good.  I've been inclined to believe they never were. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, sweet Caroline, the times never seem so good.  I've been inclined.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it for Anthony.  You made the song yours.  You made it yours.  The date is October 11, 1983. 
[02:09:30]  It's 7.18 p.m.  Detective Club Soda with self-professed organized crime soldier Lyle Chipperson.  Listen, okay, Lyle, you're requesting placement in witness protection.  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yo, I'm in the mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me.  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Lil Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle, you have no record. 
[02:10:00]  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker. 
[02:10:30]  I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something.  Then we'll see.  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit.  I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit.  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now.  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  How does this feel?  Fuck this. 
[02:11:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got our pal Ryan Starr coming in in about 20 minutes.  He was just on Jay Leno with Jim Norton last week.  We're all mulling over that last bit.  You don't like it?  It's okay.  Kenny's acting was stellar.  I think Kenny played it perfectly.  Yeah.  I like Chippa there. 
[02:11:30]  I don't like the fact that they made it look like he beat me up at the end, though.  No?  Why?  That would never happen?  Some bunch of bullshit.  What would you do?  Hit him with the interrogation chair.  Oh.  Like, what's that over there?  And when he looked, I'd fucking hit him.  Right across the fucking, right across his big cheeks.  Good one.  Thanks.  Fucking nailed him right there.  Yeah, with the fucking bottom of the chair.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Brian Starr's coming in in 20 minutes.  Who's Brian Starr?  Brian Starr.  He's a big musician blowing up, finally.  Here comes that drunk bitch.  Yo, Nico!  She's texting.  She's walking and texting.  This looks good today.  Doesn't she?  Yeah.  She looks really good.  I guess that guy thought it was more important than...  She's got to be crazy fuck, that one, right?  Well, ask her.  She's a crazy fuck.  Ask her. 
[02:12:30]  She'll tell you.  I think because she's kind of crazy.  She likes drinking and shit.  She's probably a sloppy, dirty fuck.  You'd get drunk and start doing things you'd never do.  So, the other guy felt like he had to talk to her.  My pleasure.  Anthony has a quick question for you.  We all are in agreement that you look really good today.  It smells like cocaine this morning in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were doing some bumps.  It smells like coke in here.  That wouldn't be just your nose, would it?  No.  It really smells like cocaine.  Everywhere I go, it smells like cocaine.  I don't get it.  We're in agreement you look really good today. 
[02:13:00]  Ew.  And Anthony has a question for you.  No, it was a statement, but it could be posed as a question.  I was like, I bet you she's a crazy fuck.  I bet you're like a crazy fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  You know what?  It's not fun otherwise.  You get a little drunk and you're fucking like, wow, you start doing things you wouldn't  even think you'd do.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's fucking time.  I'm up for anything, babe.  God, that's great.  I know.  Why is that?  I just thought, I think that all the time.  I just walk by and that's just like something that came into your head.  That's what guys think when any girl walks by. 
[02:13:30]  It's like, yeah, what kind of fuck would she be?  Oh, yeah.  And you get the label of like crazy wild fuck.  It's a crazy fuck.  No, you look like the type, like you'd be having a great time in bed and you'd be really  hot.  And then like, he'd look at you wrong and you'd take your shoe off and just smash his balls  with him.  Like, Nicole's too unpredictable.  Yeah.  I try not to do that.  I try not to hurt you.  Loose cannon, wild card.  Yeah, but you'd get upset.  You'd say the wrong thing and she'd fucking claw your face.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that could happen.  Oh, man.  Imagine I'd say the wrong thing.  That's kind of cool, though.  Would you want that? 
[02:14:00]  The ticking time bomb thing.  Would you want me to slap you in the face?  No, I had a girl slap me hard one time.  Like, really.  She meant it?  No, we were being dirty.  Oh.  But when she slapped me, she hit the whole like cheekbone.  It was a jarring.  Ouch.  It was like a cop slap.  But you kind of liked it.  It was a little unpleasant.  Could you have Nicole slap you?  No.  Why?  Because I'm very, I'm very, I feel very tender.  I had a girl fucking elbow me in the head once.  On purpose?  No, it was accidentally.  And it was at a gig that we were doing. 
[02:14:30]  And the whole band was there.  And it was in one of the private rooms.  Because there were a bunch of, it was like a band house that everybody had to stay in  when we were playing at this club.  And, but I got the private bedroom because I was the one that came back with the girl.  No, no, because I came back with the girl.  The other ones had like bunk beds in the main room where the TV was and everything.  Yeah.  So this girl like was going over and she kind of fucking clunked me.  And I went, ah, you hit me in the fucking head.  And she goes, ah, fuck you.  And she fucking left and just started blowing my drummer. 
[02:15:00]  I was so pissed.  I'm like, goddamn, it should have been me.  You know what happens to me?  I wake up often after because I like to party and then I'm looking through like my, my iPhone  or something and I'm like, oh, who's taping that?  Oh, really?  And I'm like, Matt, dude, delete this.  And he's like, no.  And I'm like, yeah, delete it.  And then I'm looking at myself like, I can't believe I was doing that.  I can't believe I was that crazy.  But you blackout?  I blackout sometimes.  Not all the time.  Do you think you have a problem?  No. 
[02:15:30]  Do you think you have a problem?  Oh, shit.  Well, I know I do.  No, I don't have a problem.  How many, how many texts per weekend do you look at and go, not a clue that I sent that?  It happens probably once a week.  Do you do a lot of sexting?  A lot of flirt?  Let's just say, because I know you're a married gal these days.  Would you consider it maybe a little text flirting maybe?  Yeah.  Yeah, with some dudes?  Gotta keep it spicy.  Oh, man.  Not dudes, my husband.  Oh, but I.  Or just any other dude.  There's no other guy that it's like, hey, by the way. 
[02:16:00]  It's empty promises.  But I'm sexting him.  I'm not going to deliver.  So why am I going to do that?  So you literally fucked everyone that you've sexted with?  Yeah.  Because if not, it was an empty promise.  Yeah.  I don't want to make empty promises.  I want to fulfill what I, you know.  Boy, he got himself a firecracker.  He sure did.  Yeah.  So you just send your husband dirty texts?  Yeah, if I plan on doing something dirty later.  Pictures?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah?  We're not together.  What kind of pictures do you take? 
[02:16:30]  Let's see.  Dirty.  Ah!  Danny just grabbed her phone.  He's panicking.  Danny just grabbed her phone off the console and goes, let's see.  I'll never come in again, ever again if you don't hand that over.  Are there bad pictures on there?  Yeah.  I don't remember what it is.  Show us one.  Show us one.  I can't.  Even part of a dirty picture.  This is my personal property.  The reward for giving back the phone should be one picture.  Yeah, one picture.  No.  That's fair.  That is fair.  Thank you.  It's written in the bylaws.  You should have taken a picture of your dick. 
[02:17:00]  These are fucking imagination.  I had been since you walked in.  I'm leaving now.  I have to go work on my show.  What?  You do a show here?  Yeah, yeah.  Right next door.  I never knew that.  By the way, are there any girls here that you think I have a shot with?  I'm doing a fucking horrible dry spell.  I have some friends, but not at Sirius.  Are they good looking?  Yeah, duh.  Think I roll with ugly bitches?  No, but I mean, let's be honest.  I'm not asking you to hook them up with exactly a male model.  Oh, true.  Some of them aren't really into the relationship thing now.  They just want to bang. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  That's even worse.  Do you just want to bang?  I want anything I've developed.  I need a girl who's in a relationship because then she'll fuck me hoping to get more.  Any girl who's just looking to fuck, this is not the spot they land on.  Oh.  It's true.  I'll help you out.  Jim, I got you.  Can you bring some pictures in of potentials for Jimmy?  I'm going to bring in some potentials for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see some.  Thank you, Nicole.  Let's do that.  That's your job.  Coming up.  Good idea.  How old are they?  They're...  Well, I just turned 30 on Sunday.  Oh, that's fine.  They're...  Yeah, they're all late 20s or 30s. 
[02:18:00]  All right, cool.  Was 30 tough?  I feel a little old.  Do you?  Yeah.  30...  I mean, it's just...  For some reason, 30 was tough.  40 was easy.  You still got...  I feel like 40 will be tough.  No, 30 was tough.  Still could get your legs up there.  Yeah.  Kimbo, right?  Oh, yeah.  No problems.  Do you go out dubstepping?  No, okay.  No.  Jimmy's obsessed with dubstepping.  I don't know what...  I want to see an example of dubstepping.  She's very pretty.  She looks good today.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Bigfoot.  There's a Bigfoot video.  Oh, man.  Don't call her that.  Jesus.  We have seen her.  Yeah, they really are like fucking...  I was just looking...  They're like monkey hens.  Now, some sites going with the fact that...  Is this Bigfoot?  And other sites going, this is ridiculous.  But you got a guy...  I think he's on a bike?  Bicycle?  Oh, Bigfoot can't have a bike.  It's like an ATV, I think.  Oh, ATV?  Yeah, from what it looks like.  All right.  And where is he?  Ohio.  Ohio?  Oh, yeah.  Bigfoot's not in Ohio. 
[02:19:00]  Bigfoot's in Ohio.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So in the middle of the woods, down a dirt path, trees...  All over the fucking place, obviously.  Now he's up.  Whoa!  And then look, that's why it's fake.  He goes off the road like that.  Why would you do that?  He might think it's a bear.  And then he backs up.  Walking.  And then takes off the other way.  No.  We're Slenderman.  They didn't show him...  I love Slenderman.  They didn't show him turning around, by the way.  In the slow motion of Bigfoot running across a path. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  It's insert athlete here.  Oh, come on.  That stinks.  Video's going everywhere.  By the way, can you show the turn?  Yes, it is.  Huh?  Why did he turn around?  He was scared.  He was scared and had to get out of there.  He was definitely scared of the Bigfoot guy.  He was scared.  He was scared of the Yeti.  Yeah.  The Yeti.  He should have called him.  Hey, Sask! 
[02:20:00]  Why does he have...  Watch this!  What is Sask?  Why does he have poor quality video in this day and age?  Oh, because he didn't want it clear.  And why is he filming himself as he goes through the woods?  He wanted to see where he was going.  He was hoping to see Bigfoot.  Yeah.  Oh, you'd go with the GoPro, right?  That gives you some good fucking video.  So, obviously, that's fake.  But some of the sites go with it.  Going, oh, could this be Bigfoot?  And what happened with the other guy?  I'm a Bigfoot out of Dayton, Ohio with two bad knees.  In a dream to become a big furry fucking animal.  Yes. 
[02:20:30]  In a dream to become the missing link.  He's in Ohio.  18 years ago, I left him in Ohio.  And walked through the woods.  With two very big feet.  In a dream to become an urban legend.  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I begot it.  Dream came true.  He had bad knees when he left Dayton.  Left Dayton with his dumb bad knees. 
[02:21:00]  I know.  He started his career with bad knees.  Had a bad nephew, too.  Working at the Firestone Tire Plant.  Ugh, on his knees.  You hear about fucking Roger Clemens?  What about him?  He pitched.  50 years old.  He struck out the first batter.  That minor league thing he's doing?  Yeah, but still he's 50.  Those guys are supposed to have some kind of skills.  He's 50-year-old Roger Clemens.  How fast is he pitching?  He got up to 88.  Yeah, I bet.  There's rumors that...  Does the ball go back into the future?  There's rumors he's going to come up to the big leagues to help out... 
[02:21:30]  Who the fuck?  Who the fuck?  Because their attendance is way low.  Is it Houston?  Planet Houston.  Yeah.  He had a good outing, right, Travis?  It was all right.  What do you mean all right?  Three and a third inning.  Two strikeouts.  That's good.  Yeah, I mean...  That's good.  But he's playing independent league ball.  It's not like he's playing, you know...  So he's playing the Mets.  Yeah.  And there's rumors that he's getting his shit together so he can pitch for the Astros  to get their attendance up.  Might as well.  They're terrible.  Yeah, they're horrendous. 
[02:22:00]  And they have nothing to lose.  Did they beat the Mets?  I don't know.  Fuck the Mets.  Mike Francesa?  The Mets.  Oh, that was great.  I can't find the other Bigfoot story.  The guy died or something?  He was trying to get a Bigfoot hoax together?  Yeah, he was trying to do a Bigfoot hoax.  So he dressed in a ghillie suit, which is one of those suits the snipers wear that looks like  big furry things, looks like vegetation and whatnot.  And he was going to walk through the woods.  And somehow, I guess he made it onto a road because he was a run over.  Oh, my God.  By two cars. 
[02:22:30]  Did they have video of that?  Whoops.  No, unfortunately not.  Now, a 15-year-old girl hit him with her car, then another car swerved, and a third car  driven by a 17-year-old, ran him over.  What the hell's going on?  Those teenagers don't have fucking any reaction to it.  It's not the teenage threesome he was hoping for.  No, not quite.  They'll probably go on an old man's curve to race for pinks.  The pinks.  The area had that dumped. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it's dead man's walk.  Shut up.  The ghost of Mary.  Yeah.  Gotta go to the graveyard.  She only comes out.  Yeah, the...  Oh, shut up.  The ghost of Murray's shit stash.  Never heard of that one.  Yeah, he shows up, and he fucking...  And he shines his shoes and goes, ooh.  What was the one in Smithtown?  It's the ghost of Mary or something like that.  Crazy Mary?  I don't know.  There's always some kind of Mary thing. 
[02:23:30]  So stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  We used to go to the cemetery to drink for that.  And we'd be like, and now, if you look into the darkness over there, you'll see the ghost  of some Mary fucking...  I think it was always Mary.  We were all drinking, and the girls would get scared.  We never saw shit.  We'd shove their heads in our laps.  Is that why you'd be there?  Any excuse to fuck you.  These girls would be like, let's go to the cemetery.  I'm like, wherever you want to go.  Hop in my Volkswagen Baja bug. 
[02:24:00]  And then fucking get some booze.  So that's one of the many differences between me and you.  We were nerds hoping that we were actually going to see this dump thing.  Oh, man.  We didn't use it as an excuse because we couldn't get the fucking girls.  I would put on the voice and be like, and if you look over there, through that right  holy shit, I see it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  And they'd get all scared, and they'd grab onto you, and you'd be like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then a minute later, they forget the ghost, and they're sucking your penis. 
[02:24:30]  That's it.  A ghostly brew.  It's the roof of their mouth.  Exactly.  A white ghostly brew.  They have liquid ghosts in their fucking hair.  Some strange apparition is leaking down your chin.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He started off clear, and now he's fucking milky white, and he crusts up on your collar.  Fucking whore.  Ah, shit.  Hicks89 on Twitter. 
[02:25:00]  It was Mary's grave out there in the Smithtown area.  Yeah, yes, Mary's grave.  But no one saw anything, but everyone said they did, so that kept the whole thing going  for a while.  A bunch of drivel.  There was one off 25A, a cemetery I used to go to that was, we're trying to buy Northport.  Oh, the one on the hill?  Yeah.  That's the one I used to go to with these fucking girls.  That fucking graveyard is really old.  Yeah, real old.  They had to do from like the 1800s.  The tombstones were kind of falling down the hill.  Yeah.  On to 25A.  I drive up there with the Baja bulk.  It is the dumbest place to have a cemetery.  It's literally on the side of a hill. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure back when they made it, it wasn't quite as on the side of the hill.  It's like 1860s and stuff.  True.  Yeah.  That was always fun, figuring out how to get girls to fucking do things.  God damn.  Always involved booze, though.  Always.  Always involved booze.  And you're still doing that.  Yeah, fuck.  You're still trying to figure out how to get girls to do things.  How do I do that?  To do things.  My God.  You're Peter Pan.  You used to go to Leahy Park.  It was called Leahy, across from Harborfields, the elementary school. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Uncle Paul.  Sure, you go to Leahy Park and you're playing the leaves.  Looks like you got some leaves down your pants.  Let me get in there and get them.  They're going to be crispy crunching all over.  So you would help them.  Sure.  Sure.  Put some leaves in your underwear and they'll go down there and clean them out.  I'll show you.  Let's play rake fingers. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, it was a good playground there.  Sure.  And, you know, nothing better than drinking and jumping around in the playground with some friends.  Yeah.  This is a long time ago, folks.  I don't do this now.  That would be really creepy.  And coming from me, that means it's really creepy.  Your boyish asshole pressed on one of the jungle gym bars.  It's stinking.  Like trying.  I just tried so hard all the time.  Overly trying hard. 
[02:27:00]  And then you have to fight off fucking other guys like goddamn caveman times.  They come over.  Here's the guy that looks really good.  And here's the guy that's got a little bit of a better car and shit.  And I'm there trying to make them laugh their asses off.  Sometimes I'd win.  Sometimes I wouldn't win.  And no pussy had been sent.  No.  Her eyes had rolled over white.  She'd suck my cock.  Yeah, that was bad. 
[02:27:30]  As a guy, you're right.  You have to compete like a motherfucker.  Oh, it was fucking...  You think girls have to compete that much?  Well, no.  Because there was always less girls.  So they were just trying to protect their vaginas.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  So all they have to do is present like a bunch of orangutans and we'll fuck them.  Yes.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  And it was friends, you know, too.  So, you know, you'd have to piss your friend off and totally like cock block them in the worst way.  And then after it was all said and done, you'd be like, you know, sorry. 
[02:28:00]  Sorry.  You couldn't stay mad at each other.  But it was one of those things.  Like, I fucked Joe Curry over so many times with girls.  So many times.  Oh!  What did you have?  He hated me.  What did you have he didn't that you want every time?  I had, I've told it before, the Tequila Sunrise was such an icebreaker with girls.  Because the guys would only bring beers.  It's short and fucking narrow-minded.  They'd bring beers.  I would bring tequila, grenadine, and fucking orange juice.  Jesus. 
[02:28:30]  And I'd be like, you know, they'd be, oh, you got a drink or something?  And think it's a beer.  And I'd go, you want a Tequila Sunrise?  I'd be like, first I'd pick my mark.  Right.  And I'd be like, keep it quiet.  I don't have that much.  She'd go, oh, thanks.  Like, now you're making her special.  So I'd make a drink.  And, you know, well, tequila, and, oh, this is good.  It's a girly drink.  So it tasted really sweet.  It was nice.  And it's tequila.  So it got them all fucked up.  And then I'd be joking with them and talking and giving them that look in the eye and the nod like I'm listening to what they're saying.  What were you thinking, though?  I want to fuck! 
[02:29:00]  What was Joe Kerry doing during this?  Just opening up another cheap beer?  He brought some Meister Brow and cigar, or cigarillos.  We used to smoke that shit.  And he was so nervous back then and intimidated by girls that he would clam up and trip over his words and shit.  But why wouldn't he live and learn and enough of the cheap beer and come up with his own mixed drink that the girls would like?  I don't know.  I mean, obviously the tequila sunrise was yours, but he couldn't come up with, like, I don't know, a fuzzy navel or something? 
[02:29:30]  He's going to bring a Rob Roy.  Get some fucking old 40s star.  Rob Roy.  A Rob Roy.  Get me a Manhattan neat.  Yeah.  You remember the White Owls, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, smoking the cigars and stuff was good when you were playing poker with the guys over the house.  I thought it was so fucking cool.  If you're trying to get a girl, don't fucking smoke the cigar.  You're going to have dumb cigar breath and shit.  Do you have any of your teeth?  Oh, yeah.  All that shit.  We look like idiots.  Jesus.  And we just would be playing poker in someone's basement thinking we were cool because we were smoking those things. 
[02:30:00]  Oh.  That was horrible.  Go ahead.  And then Joe what?  No, Joe got so mad at me also because one time I remember I had a Target for the night and then another girl came over.  And I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to crack the deal with the first one, so I just corralled the other one with a tequila sunrise also and was talking to her.  And I was trying to work both angles and see which was going to pan out.  And Joe literally came up to me and just said, Anthony, could you just please one?  Right.  Give me a chance at one of them. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  So I ejected one.  Did you fuck one?  Yeah, eventually.  No.  Poor Joe.  Oh, Joe almost fell out of his chair.  Poor Joe.  But he will be playing the big gig, right?  Yes, he's my keyboard player for Rotgut.  Yeah, he'll be playing there.  Where?  Belmore.  Friday, 9 p.m.  Yes.  K.J.  K.J. Farrell.  K.J. Farrell.  Belmore. 
[02:31:00]  Belmore.  Big Rotgut show.  Also, opening, Art of the Topless.  You might remember them.  They do a lot of the songs from Ron and Fez's show and our show and things like that.  Very good shit.  Yeah.  You know, we should take a break because Ryan Starr is here.  He's going to have a couple minutes to set up.  He's going to play a song or two.  Exactly.  Man, I would like him to play an original and maybe some kind of cool cover.  I just like covers.  That'd be nice.  Who doesn't like a good cover?  Zeppelin?  What do you want?  That's pretty good.  Really?  Acoustic Zeppelin.  Fuck yeah.  Someone does it well?  Acoustic Zeppelin is always good. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy?  Oh, I don't know.  Whatever Ryan wants.  I don't mind originals.  I don't mind covers.  I don't care.  No, we'll do whatever.  Whatever he wants.  You know, people tell me, Jim, you're so easygoing.  No one tells you that.  That's not a personal lie.  That's not true.  That's not a personal lie.  Jim, you're so easygoing.  You're so easygoing, Jim.  You just go with the flow, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jim's the perfect gentleman.  I'm told I'm the Sanka of people.  Roger Clemens is fat. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  Well, I thought he did okay, considering he's 50.  Hey, everybody.  Glad to be back.  Did I say his fastball got up to 88?  See you all later.  Yeah, really?  And he's frosting his hair still.  Is he?  Yeah, there's a big...  All the sports blogs are all about his frosted hair.  Roger the Rocket.  You got to get a picture of his frosted hair.  Should we break and come back?  Yeah, let's do it.  Ryan Starr next.  Thank you all.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas. 
[02:32:30]  And I can tell you it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon.  Roger Clemens is in George's box.  And Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things...  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen,  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box,  announcing he is back. 
[02:33:00]  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention, fans.  He is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  Sirius, Sirius XS.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:33:30]  Space Hog.  In the meantime.  Ryan Starr in studio.  It's been a while, Ryan.  What is going on?  It has been a while.  I told Ryan off air, I'm so happy for him,  because you've done very well in the last few years, 
[02:34:00]  but you're getting a bump up right now.  It's been a long road.  Well, first of all, you guys have been there since day one, man.  Let's be honest.  Day four.  And we believed when no one else believed, Ryan.  Oh, my goodness.  Seriously.  I had pimples and braces and long 90s hair.  It was awesome.  We did Leno together.  And how does a band get booked on tonight?  What's the process of that?  Do you submit?  Wait, what did you say?  You went through the best part so quickly.  What?  Say that again, but with, you know, we did what together? 
[02:34:30]  We did the Tonight Show.  Ah, yes.  Come on, for you, I know it's no big deal, but, you know.  Well, no, you had a great featured spot.  I was just doing a silly bit, but you had a real spot.  You were great, but it was awesome to be there.  That was a big deal for me.  How does that happen for a band?  Because I hear there's a lot.  Every band they use on that show does very well.  So that's a really good sign that you're on.  Yeah, no, definitely.  That was a big deal.  You know, I was out there for a second, kind of floating out there, doing my thing.  I made a new music video on my own right here in New York. 
[02:35:00]  And then went on the road.  How'd you pay for it?  What's that?  How'd you pay for it?  How much was it?  I dug deep in my pockets.  Really?  You know, we got creative, and I owe lots of people favors now for the rest of time.  But I had to be done.  I wasn't getting the support.  You know, musicians getting support these days is not the same.  I mean, videos are, sorry to interrupt, videos are important again.  They are.  Yeah.  That's like the, that's the main tool.  I mean, kids aren't, they're going online and watching their music while they're doing,  you know, 50 other things. 
[02:35:30]  So you got to put, and this one particularly was cool because it got a little more, you  know, the video's a little more risque.  Like we, we went to, to sexier places, like, uh, 50 shades of gray places or whatever you  want to call it.  These, I don't know what you call it, sex.  And, uh, uh, but it was just a beautiful video.  I mean, it wasn't gratuitous.  It was just really, I just want this beautiful moving image photography, you know, and, and,  and it worked.  And the video now has almost two, two million hits.  It's like, it's rocking on its own.  You know, that was really exciting for me because it was the biggest thing I've ever done. 
[02:36:00]  And I did it on my own.  And so it was one of those Rocky moments where I said, I got, I'm going to go do this.  And, uh, how'd you get the traction?  Cause a lot of guys that are talented get a video out there.  You know, I had the base, you know, I've been doing this long enough that there is a fan,  an incredible fan base out there and a passionate one.  And, and I asked them to go spread a video.  I mean, they're, they're monsters are amazing.  They love their, cause I met these people on the road.  I've spent four hours after every show, you know, meeting people and getting to, it goes both  ways, you know, and that's what feeds me when I come back into the studio to make music. 
[02:36:30]  Uh, but this video went going and then, and then, uh, radio started playing it.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I got picked up with a great label Island Records and literally  a day, an hour after we negotiated the contract, the first phone call I got from the publicist  was, so your single's coming out on iTunes on Tuesday, which by the way, single is out  right now.  Stay a while.  Uh, and, uh, you're going to do the tonight show in like four days.  And it was just, it was that fast.  It was amazing.  And, and for me, you gotta understand, you know, there's plenty of artists out there and 
[02:37:00]  maybe I would have been this way too, but like you can be so cool and just, yeah, no  big deal.  And your shoegazing and all that stuff, man, I'm, I'm in the airport, like I'm taking a  piss and JFK, like with the guy next to him, like, um, and I'm just, I couldn't hold it.  And we got off the airplane and the, the, the flight attendants were like, we'd like  to congratulate Ryan Starr and his band for, uh, playing tonight and everyone's cheering.  It was like, you know, I'm going to enjoy the ride now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was fun.  You know, sometimes people are just too, too cool for their own. 
[02:37:30]  Right, right, right.  It's been a long road too.  Uh, did you feel like giving up anywhere in there?  Whew.  I never knew an option, you know, like, you work hard, you know, I know your guy's story  too.  I mean, it's, it's like, you just, you stick with it, I guess.  And I want to be that guy.  I mean, at this point, a lot of my songs are about, you know, just, just not giving  up and being who you are and living in the moment and all that stuff.  So, you know, I feel in a way I've experienced all this so I can mean it more when I do sing  and, and the road has been really, I mean, it's, it's been a long one. 
[02:38:00]  It's been a tough one.  Um, so when I experienced these things, it feels that much better.  And like I said, it really is, I've had those rocky moments now, like, like where you  just, it's you, you're a fighter, you're out there, you get knocked down.  And, and, um, I don't know any other way, to be honest, I'm a hard worker.  It's just, that comes natural.  But what I'm most proud about now is that, you know, not giving up, like you said, you  know, as hard as you could work, you know, just sticking through it and seeing the other  side now is really fun.  Is it embarrassing doing a music video?  I was, cause I would always like, cause you have to sing the same thing and you have to 
[02:38:30]  like, just the, is the process of doing that?  Like, I would be so embarrassed having to, to, to do that.  Like, um, and it's like, and it doesn't matter what band it is or what song it is or how great  the song is, just the process of having to sing and then stop and reset and capture the  moment and people are watching.  Like, Oh, that's the hardest, but the people watching thing, it took me a while to get used  to it.  Um, and now I just realized like, you know, you could be, you can be a little insecure on  five, seven camera people or whatever.  Or, but then if you realize you're there, they're not there, you're really talking to 
[02:39:00]  the people watching the video that aren't there yet.  And I figured out a way, you know, I've gotten out of my head a little bit to, to, to handle  that better now.  And in this last one, I mean, I was walking around Brooklyn streets in the middle of the  night and just, you know, just had fun with it.  Again, it's like, I'm trying to just have fun with it all and not take anything so serious  now.  And then, um, they went and shot the rest, uh, at some, some house in Jersey and, uh, you  know, I'm sure I got the actors fairly drunk and, you know, naked. 
[02:39:30]  And it was, it was a good process.  And then when I saw the finished thing, I was just, I trusted my friend to make this  great video.  His name's Andrew Zay and he's never done a video.  He's a photographer.  Wow.  I just love his work.  And I was like, you want to do this?  And he jumped in and it killed it, man.  He's getting worked out.  I mean, it's just, uh, and it's cool cause you're working with friends and it's, it just  feels, it feels good.  You know, I've done the other thing where I've gone with the big name guy cause he's going  to do this.  And all they do is pocket the money and buy a BMW.  Like this guy put everything into the video and it looks like a $50,000 video and we  did not spend anything close to that. 
[02:40:00]  It's a real do it yourself thing.  So if you go online and check it out, it's cool.  And, um, what's the video again?  It's called stay a while.  Stay a while.  Right.  You know, you see Brian Starr stay a while.  You'll, you'll see it.  And it's, uh, I'm really proud of it.  I'm really, and I've done cool videos before, but this one, this one's something special.  Is that, is that what a video, like a, a really good video cost 50 grand?  I think like, you know, when you look at the high rollers, when you look at like the  Rihanna's and the Beyonce's, I'm sure that's like, I mean, that's 50 grand just on hair  and makeup.  We're in, we're 10, 15 seconds in. 
[02:40:30]  It looks really, really, bro, man.  He does.  Look at that.  Beautiful.  He dare I say beautiful, but what the fuck is beautiful.  And it's real for me.  It's cool because it's really New York.  I mean, I, I, I'm when I tour, the only thing that keeps me not homesick is having my  stickers on my t-shirt say New York city all over them.  So I'm having the video and you know, if I could be like the Spike Lee of rock and roll,  I'll be, I'll be psyched, you know, do you tell him that you want, like when you do a  video, do you go, all right, I want it to feel like this, or I want this to be the concept  or I'm going to walk through New York. 
[02:41:00]  Or do you go, look, I want to make a video.  And he goes, all right, you should just walk and have a girl in it.  Like, I, how does that, I tend to walk pretty, I've learned, like, I'm like becoming a walker  in my videos.  This one, we, we, I wanted, I wanted it to be innocent.  I wanted it to be like that summer memory, you know, that we all had when you're growing up.  And, uh, we found these people that aren't actors like that guy, we found at the diesel  store in Union Square and, uh, he's psyched.  Uh, I think he like broke up with his girlfriend cause he like fell in love with this girl and  said, but the girl, uh, she, she's also a friend of the photographer's friend of mine. 
[02:41:30]  And I just wanted like, and she's beautiful, but I didn't want like drop dead model, like  fake gorgeous.  I wanted like real, real, right.  And, uh, that, that's, what's also fun.  And, and, and I feel like people can relate to it cause it's not, this video is well done.  Yeah.  We're watching it as you talk.  It's, it's really, really good.  Where are you walking to?  Yeah, man.  Where are you walking to?  Yeah.  I got to pick up my lawn.  Get it?  Yeah.  You know, it's funny cause like, no, we didn't have permits.  We're just stealing all these shots.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm, I'm on the streets and people are honking me behind. 
[02:42:00]  You know, this is like when we're in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, people don't wait for anybody.  Right.  They're like, what's going on?  They don't care.  New York.  They don't care if you shoot, they don't care if Madonna's filming a musical.  Yeah.  Get out of my way.  They get pissed the fuck off.  They're really.  She's hot, this girl.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait about 10 seconds.  Oh, you saw that little, there's a little, you know, vodka.  So does she date, she dating that guy now?  Uh, no, no.  Oh, he didn't.  I didn't, I didn't keep up with the soul proper of it all.  But I think, I think what I heard is he, he might've like got really in love and she kind of. 
[02:42:30]  Whoa.  Oh, here we go.  This is the unrated version.  Whoa.  She's a very lovely buzzer.  There is a clean version for people easily fed.  Fuck, I'm not a clean version.  Exactly.  Hold on right there.  If you pause it, you'll see.  Oh, yeah, we got to pause that.  No, there is, uh, there's actual slippage there.  So wait, he left his check for her because he fell in love with her?  Wow, you're a good pause.  How'd you do that?  Danny Ross.  Yeah, he's the internet master.  Yeah, he's a freaking pro.  Email me that picture.  He learned this skill watching Zoom.  It's funny, we were doing a photo shoot, uh, this new photo shoot for, for what's coming up. 
[02:43:00]  And, um, the photographer is the guy, again, who did the video.  And we called her as a joke.  We were having some fun.  We had some drinks.  And we're like, let's call her up.  And I said, here we go, like, you're my girl now.  Like, you're the girl in the video.  Like, you're my Alicia Silverstone, you know?  And we're like, I just wrote a song.  It's called Third Bass, all right?  This is where I'm going.  Oh, no.  And then it's like, you could just keep, like, you know, building it up.  Like, wrote a song.  It's called Grand Slam, you know?  How do you, how do you feel about, how do you feel about, you know, showing, let's say, labia? 
[02:43:30]  I don't know.  What, is she an actress?  Or no?  No, she's amazing.  She's just a cool, she's a photographer.  Oh, okay.  She's a photographer.  She's got some nice teardrops.  She's the, uh, she, like, follows, I think, fairly wealthy people around with cameras  and documents their vacations and stuff.  Oh, really?  She's amazing.  Oh, I remember having her around when I was...  Yeah, yeah, you called her left.  Sure, sure.  Ryan, why don't we play a song?  Oh, wow.  You want to play the single?  Yeah, I'll play this song.  Let's play the, uh, kumbaya version of Stay a While Here for You. 
[02:44:00]  Wait, hey, can we match it up with the video?  I can't watch that and sing it to the same time.  I wouldn't think so.  I would love to see how many people are, like, going on right now.  Oh, there's probably a fuckload right now, especially after, hey, the unedited, whoa!  Yeah, she's very hot.  Yeah, I think you're going to get a few views from us today.  The greatest thing is we had to do this clean edit version, and it's got, like, 20 views,  and the other one, I guess there's two separate versions now, but if you add them up,  it's, like, almost two million views, and it just shows people, you know, they make  a big deal, you need to clean, you need to clean, and then no one watches it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, watch the whole, the real thing.  Yeah, of course.  Exactly.  All right, Ryan Starr, Stay a While.  All right, Ryan Starr. 
[02:45:00]  I feel you near, what I'm saying is I need you here, even though love never seems to  last.  If you think we got a chance, stay a while, oh, you got to stay a while.  These days are wild. 
[02:45:30]  Baby, won't you stay a while?  I drop the needle on the bell brigade, we slow dance till the moonlight fades.  Tell me now that you never leave, you always stay here with me.  Oh, oh, I keep you safe from the circus show, the bullshit and the blowing smoke, the knife  hidden under every sleeve, they stab you back, watch you bleed. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, oh, they're going to tell you what you want to hear.  Like, I could make you a star next year, well, if New York City's lights are so bright, how come  so many people cry?  There's a lot of people crying tonight.  Stay a while.  Stay a while.  Oh, you got to stay a while.  Oh, oh.  These days are wild.  Baby, won't you stay a while? 
[02:46:30]  Let your hair fall around your face  I would kill just to keep you safe  Put your body next to mine  Just let go and close your eyes  I shiver when I feel your skin 
[02:47:00]  Like a sinner who's been forgiven  Go on baby, shine your light  Cause no one's gonna find us here tonight  Stay a while  Oh, you got to stay a while  Oh, these days are wild  Baby, won't you stay a while  Oh, I, I, I 
[02:47:30]  Oh, I, I, I, I, I, I  Won't you stay a while  I'm in.  Jesus.  Ryan Starr, stay a while.  You just sold a few records, sir. 
[02:48:00]  That's great, man.  Wow.  Really great.  That's the bonfire version, you know?  That's the fun one.  Do you like singing like that more than you like being plugged in, or is it...  You know, it's all different, man.  I literally, literally last night I was at a bonfire and had a little ukulele guitar  and playing that and just having fun.  And so that's...  He's got the perfect life.  He's just at a bonfire last night, Ant.  It's John Balby's house.  Were you making tequila sunrises for the ladies?  Yeah, that works.  Anthony just taught a lot of people to move today. 
[02:48:30]  Wow, fuck that cheap beer.  It doesn't work after the, you know, early 20s.  Yeah, believe me.  Get your own fucking beer after that.  Yeah.  But then you're plugged in and you're amped up and it's, you know, it's a whole different world.  I still, I come from rock and roll.  I come from, I was in a rock band from the age of 50.  You guys know.  I mean, my first gig was at CBGB's in New York when I was 15 years old.  What was your influences?  I know it's a hat question, but at 15...  No, no, it's not, man.  I mean, I found rock when I was, you know...  In that age when, like, you just find cool music and stuff, it was when, like, Pearl Jam 
[02:49:00]  and Nirvana were coming out.  So for me, I feel lucky.  Like, sometimes I look around now with kids that age and I'm like, oof, what are they drawing  from?  But I was probably at the tail end of maybe this rock and roll renaissance, you know,  where I feel like I had a real good education.  And then I backtracked from there and got into stuff like The Doors and all that stuff.  But I grew up on, you know, it's Nine and Snails, Pearl Jam, maybe R.E.M., The Pixies.  And that was, like, my Bible growing up.  And before that, I mean, thank God they came out.  Because before that, I was a saxophone player and I was aspiring to be, like, the world's next 
[02:49:30]  Kenny G.  So they saved all of our lives by playing some cool music for me to eat here.  Yeah, I imagine there's a lot more sex available to this style of music than fucking jamming  on the sax.  I don't know.  Doesn't he own Starbucks or something?  Does he really?  I think he's one of the early investors in Starbucks.  Is he really?  Kenny G?  Yeah, Seattle.  Come on.  I'm pretty sure.  Check it out.  No, it would only make sense.  Why?  Absolutely.  Because why wouldn't he have done that?  Perfect example of, like, oh, douchebag makes good.  You mean while we weren't paying attention to all the shit that was so obvious? 
[02:50:00]  Precise.  While you guys were drinking Frappuccinos, he was, like, on the phone with his accountant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Another big shoes bag full of money?  Great.  Coffee money.  Why the bonfire last night?  Where were you?  I was at Montauk, man.  I write a lot of my songs out there.  It's just great beach, which is changing.  I mean, I grew up in the summers out there surfing and stuff.  And now I go there and there's, like, Lamborghinis parked out front.  It's becoming the new hot spot. 
[02:50:30]  It's definitely the thing.  And it's a strange feeling.  It used to be kind of down and dirty when we were all growing up.  Yeah.  It was a fisherman town, you know?  It's kind of like the Hamptons are pushing their way out that way.  They pushed.  But the water's too cold out there.  No, it's great now.  It's like 80.  Oh, they even changed the temperature of the water.  It's a heaters.  They're heating up.  You know, if you get enough people to pee in the ocean.  It's fucking cold out there.  I'm sorry.  Where do you go?  I mean, there's no warm up here.  I'm a North Fork guy.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  It's warm.  Yeah.  There's no waves there.  My brother's way out near Orient Point, so close to that. 
[02:51:00]  There's some shit out that way.  I mean, it's something out there.  It just spiritually connects me to it.  I've always written songs out there, so I try to get out as much as I can.  But then again, the Hamptons every once in a while is good.  Is this new?  Kenny G is an aircraft pilot.  Okay.  And he has a seaplane, the DeHavilland Beaver, which, of course, lends itself to the joke.  It's probably the only beaver he's ever been in.  Oh, I wouldn't laugh at that type of humor.  Of course not.  He's also an early investor in the Starbucks coffeehouse chain. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, but the early guys didn't do much.  And Facebook.  Yeah, why not?  Fucking Yahoo and Apple.  Why get involved in Facebook?  I waited until it was 30 a share.  Right.  Good job, Jimmy.  That's when you should buy it.  Yeah, what's up?  Who is on this microphone, lad?  Like, this tastes like...  No, it's like a sweet lip gloss.  Like, my lips are glossy now.  Oh, Jimmy.  No.  I was standing in front of it.  That's probably...  They spray them with Febreze sometimes.  Oh, wonderful.  But no one talks on that, really.  No.  Not really.  So I'm getting pure chemical. 
[02:52:00]  No one does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why not?  The worst, though, is like, would you rather have something like that or just horrible fucking  smoking and coffee breath?  You should see the thing.  Sometimes, I remember, oh, man.  So when I was younger, so I became a germaphobe, I think, too much, but I think credited to  playing clubs in New York City growing up.  Yeah.  And I was like 16 or 17.  You know, my parents had to, like, get me into the show.  Otherwise, I don't have a fake idea yet.  And I remember on this microphone, it tasted disgusting.  I was like, I got to start.  I got to buy my own mic.  Like, that was the thing I had to save up for. 
[02:52:30]  So I had this microphone.  And then I saw the guy who went on right before me.  He comes out.  He's like, hey, good set, man.  And he had, like, serious funk all over his lips.  And I was like, oh, my God.  You have to at some point.  Now, I wasn't going to bring this up.  I, myself, am a singer.  Are you sure?  And when I would be playing out, like you said, you're playing out in the clubs, the  dented-up mic with bits of food in the fucking screen.  Yeah, yeah.  It was horrible.  And when you sing, you're not off the bike.  You're eating the fucking thing. 
[02:53:00]  You're eating the fucking thing.  Your mouth's hitting it.  The smell of the mic.  It was terrible.  So finally, yeah, you go out and get that Shure fucking 58, the road.  58, yeah.  There's a girl named Charlotte Underwood.  She's a funny black comic.  And she does a bit at the end where she would blow the microphone.  Ooh.  And she would put the whole microphone in her mouth.  And I was like, how the fuck are you doing that?  I saw Shirley Manson way back when she was in a band called Angelfish.  Shirley Manson from Garbage, right?  Yeah, sure.  Sexy girl.  Oh, yeah.  I saw her in a band called Angelfish.  She opened for the band Live, right, when they were big on Top of the World. 
[02:53:30]  And it was like at Irving Plaza.  It was a cool show.  And she was in this band.  And she did things with this microphone.  And this was before she made it.  Holy shit.  So she was just a dirty girl.  I mean, she had this miniskirt on.  And she literally right up there in front of her.  I mean, it was, your jaw dropped.  It was insane.  Nice.  And then here comes fucking Live.  How you doing?  We're all fighting to sing into that one.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  Yeah, little known fact.  What a filthy girl. 
[02:54:00]  I'm telling you all these facts.  She is cute, though.  I always thought she was kind of cool.  Garbage is a great band.  Yeah.  And they're still doing it, too, man.  They never really went away.  Yeah.  The new record, I heard Madison play a few tracks.  She interviewed the band on Lithium.  And I liked their new stuff.  I didn't go out and buy it or anything.  But no one knows about it.  I don't understand.  But it's a really good record.  There's so much noise out there.  You can't do good stuff.  Huh?  Maybe not now.  She's still pretty.  She's not bad at all.  But back in the day, she looked pretty fucking good. 
[02:54:30]  She looked really good.  Ryan, you want to play another one before we get out of here?  We were thinking a cover or something.  Something different.  Oh, man.  I mean, what do you want to play?  I could do a cover.  Let's do a cover.  If you don't want to.  Do it short.  What would you like to do?  You don't have to play.  I swear to God.  By the way, I have to leave before I play.  Can you?  You don't like Ryan Starr?  I love Ryan Starr.  Jimmy obviously doesn't like Ryan Starr.  Have you ever been walked out on like this?  How rude.  I love Ryan.  I have a flight to go.  I'm doing actually Leno tomorrow.  Obviously, I love him.  He's doing Leno tomorrow.  See, he's the guy.  He's not telling anyone at the urinals that he's on Leno tomorrow. 
[02:55:00]  He's like, I'm just doing Leno.  He's trying to get something else done.  His plane leaves at 6.  I don't know why he's leaving like this.  This is weird, Ryan.  It's cool.  He's got a superhero shirt on.  He's got business to do.  That's why Kenny has a nappy.  I'll see you guys.  Captain America.  See you later, man.  Thank you.  No, absolutely.  Take it easy, Jimmy.  We were thinking cover, but we don't care.  What would you like to do?  This is your time.  Isn't it our time, Mr. Hand?  I'll do a cover, man.  You don't have to, though.  What cover are you doing? 
[02:55:30]  Or you can do a cover and then do another original.  It's up to you.  You make the final call right now.  No, I don't.  I can't do that.  Please, please.  I can't.  This is your home.  I can't.  They want to go on terms, man.  I say do a cover.  I was hoping for the doors, actually.  What did you say?  Nothing.  I didn't hear it.  The doors.  All right.  I was told to do one of my own, right?  Yeah, it's fine.  Officially.  All right.  This is called Brand New Day.  Nice.  Dream. 
[02:56:00]  Track the clocks and give me some time, yeah.  I've stayed in one place for too long, gotta get on the run again.  I saw the one thing that I want, hell bent, get out of bed. 
[02:56:30]  I'm throwing rocks at your window, you're tying the bedsheets together.  They say that we're dreaming too big, but I say this town's too small.  Dream, send me a sign, turn back the clocks, give me some time.  I need to break out and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes to the brand new day. 
[02:57:00]  It's a brand new day!  I've taken hits like a brawler, but I'm getting back up again.  And from the moment I saw her, I was hell bent with heaven's sands.  I'm throwing rocks at your window.  We're leaving this place together.  They say that we're flying too high. 
[02:57:30]  We'll get used to looking up.  Dream, send me a sign.  Turn back the clocks, give me some time.  I need to break out and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes to the brand new day.  It's a brand new day.  I know it's a brand new day. 
[02:58:00]  I know it's a brand new day.  Dream, send me a sign.  Turn back the clocks, give me some time.  Time, I need to break out and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes to the brand new day. 
[02:58:30]  It's a brand new day.  It's a brand new day.  Hey, la, la.  Na, na, na.  Oh.  Ryan Starr, brand new day.  It's lacking a little energy, I think.  Besides that.  It's early, it's early.  I'm kidding.  Are you fucking kidding? 
[02:59:00]  That song is a theme song to a television show on Fox called Lie to Me.  That Tim Roth show where he was.  Oh, Tim Roth.  Right.  They canceled it.  I was so psyched.  I was like, I'm going to make money and everything.  I remember that now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Still taking the subway here.  Fucking Tim Roth.  Reservoir Dogs.  Yes.  Yeah, he's badass, man.  Fuck yeah.  It was a cool show.  It taught people how to spot liars and stuff.  Did you get to meet him?  No, I never met him.  Jesus.  Never met him.  I think he Twittered me once.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:59:30]  You guys Twittered me.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I just Twittered you.  Twittered me now.  That's great.  I'll Twitter again.  I'll say, hey, man.  Did Jim really leave for a six o'clock flight?  No, no.  He's got a flight.  He didn't really have to leave, though.  You're such a fucking scumbag.  No, he did.  Yeah, he did.  I know Jimmy.  He feels bad when he's got to leave.  It's like, fuck.  I got to go.  But when he's got a flight, there's no stopping him.  He's a fucking juggernaut to the airport.  Amazing.  He'll ditch everybody.  It's like, what? 
[03:00:00]  Five minutes?  No, let's go.  They can find their own ride.  Right, right, right, right.  I thought it was like morning poop emergency or something.  No, it was early.  Could be.  That all sucked.  No, he's a big fan.  I love him, man.  He came back from Leno saying, I met Ryan Starr.  I'm like, he's been on our show a million fucking times.  Yeah, you know, seeing him on the Leno show, it was very comforting.  Like I said, it was like having some, just you know how it could get out there.  It was like having some New York blood.  It was cool.  And I met one of the Olympians.  Which one?  The wrestler guy.  Oh, the wrestler guy.  That's good.  He won a gold medal, and he's the wrestler guy. 
[03:00:30]  Well, you know what?  He's the wrestler guy.  Yeah, that's true.  What are you going to say?  I feel like I could have taken him, man.  Honestly.  Really?  He's like, he was tinier, you know?  They make weight and stuff.  I was like, I don't know.  Even though you're not in the same weight class, you could take an Olympic wrestler.  You know, I learned everything about fighting.  Good question.  Remember that Sylvester Stallone movie, Over the Top?  Over the Top.  I feel like from that, I learned how to turn the hat around.  Maybe his arm wrestle.  Turn the hat backwards.  Yeah, you're ready to rock.  Punch the guy in the nose.  Yeah.  When I was a kid, the worst thing I've ever done in my life. 
[03:01:00]  This is terrible, was I saw that movie.  And when they say when parents, you know, get all up in arms about that entertainment,  you know, can mess up kids.  They're so right.  Video games, violence.  Influence, do you?  Like, you have to be, you know, right from wrong.  But I seriously, man, was a victim of that because I saw that movie.  And my best friend at the time was a girl.  And she kept beating me in arm wrestles.  Like, she was like, and she was a tomboy, just beating me, beating me.  I should probably not tell the story.  But I did the, I did like the whole psych you're out thing.  Like, I went for it and right before the thing.  And we were kids. 
[03:01:30]  We were very young.  Sure.  I was like five.  And I, and I like punched her, like right before the thing, just to psych.  And she, I just remember being like, don't tell my mom.  And I learned at that moment, you're not allowed to hit girls.  You can't do that.  No.  It's terrible.  And it was the, it was the worst thing I've ever done in my life, I think.  Wow.  And I, and I remembered though, like being like, Sylvester Stallone did, like,  I didn't understand right from wrong.  Was she upset?  I mean, she probably kicked the crap out of me.  Probably kicked her ass.  She was a lot stronger than I was.  Good.  I was waiting for you to punch me, you mother.  I was wailing on you. 
[03:02:00]  But I remember, and it was a good thing.  Because by the time I got like into Grand Theft Auto, you know, in high school,  it was like, it was good.  But I understood the difference between reality and entertainment.  Yeah, and take the car out and try to go for a fucking stunt bonus.  But it's true.  Watching wrestling growing up.  I mean, we used to flip each other over like that.  We didn't even think twice about it.  Kids will imitate wrestling like crazy.  Crazy.  All the moves.  And sometimes they bust each other's fucking necks.  I wish while it happens.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Price, the cost of doing business.  Sure.  Why not?  Well, Ryan Starr, this was a pleasure, sir.  Always.  Thanks for being here.  So I'm not going to force you to do a cover. 
[03:02:30]  Some of the biggest supporters.  I love you guys.  I'm a fan since forever.  That's fucking amazing.  Thanks, man.  I remember driving the Expressway with the wow stuff.  Wow.  Come on.  I remember the old days.  Come on.  Isn't it great when somebody on the way up talks to the people that are on the way down?  Yes.  What are you going to do?  It happens.  Amazing.  Thanks for all the support.  We saw the limelight.  It was nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, have fun, man.  It looks like you're doing great.  Appreciate it.  I hope to see you soon, man.  I'm going to go make the new album. 
[03:03:00]  And in the meantime, stay a while on iTunes and check out the video and Twitter me.  And all that stuff.  The next time you do a cover.  I think someone's going to yell at me as soon as I walk out this door.  No, no, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Don't even worry about it.  I could have done a cover.  Nah.  I could still do a cover.  Which one would you have done?  I was going to do In Your Eyes.  Peter Gabriel.  I'll do that on the road sometimes.  It's a good one.  Holy fuck.  Can you do that?  Can you play this out?  Let's do it, man.  All right.  Ryan Starr.  I'm sorry.  I twisted his arm.  I'll be honest.  But I just wanted to hear you sing some more.  I get so lost sometimes. 
[03:03:30]  Days pass.  And this emptiness fills my heart.  When I want to run away I drive off in my car But whichever way I go I come back to 
[03:04:00]  the place you are And all my instincts, they return  In the grand facade So soon will burn Without noise, without my pride  I reach out from the inside In your eyes 
[03:04:30]  I light the heat I am complete  I see the doorway Of a thousand churches  Your eyes  The resolution Of all your fruitless searches  Oh, I see the light in the heat  I want to touch the light The heat I see in your eyes  Love 
[03:05:00]  See, I don't like to see So much pain  So much wasted  And these moments Keep slipping away  I get so tired Of working so hard For our survival 
[03:05:30]  I look to the time with you To keep me awake in life  Oh, and all my instincts They return And the grand facade  Soon will burn Without my voice  Without my pride I reach out from the inside 
[03:06:00]  Oh, and all my instincts In your eyes  I light the heat I am complete  I see the doorway Of a thousand churches  Your eyes The resolution Of all your fruitless searches  Oh, and all my instincts In your eyes  Oh, I see the light And the heat 
[03:06:30]  I want to touch the light And the heat I see  In your eyes In your eyes  In your eyes In your eyes  In your eyes  In your eyes  Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord In your eyes  In your, in your eyes
