<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of two news stories: the cracked protective coating at the Willis Tower Skydeck, which the hosts debunked as overblown media sensationalism, and the firing of Rochester radio hosts Kimberly and Beck for their comments on the city's policy covering gender reassignment surgery.  The hosts played audio clips of Kimberly and Beck's remarks, deemed offensive by some, and debated the justification for their firing. This led into a discussion about a transgender girl playing on a girls' varsity softball team in Rochester, fueled by a caller's criticism and Joe Rogan's comments about biological differences. The hosts expressed mixed opinions, ranging from confusion to skepticism, and engaged in humorous, albeit crude, banter.  They also played and reacted to audio of Kimberly and Beck discussing the same topic, criticizing its poor quality while defending their right to free speech.  The segment included a discussion about Wendy Williams, Donald Sterling,  clogging families, Dan Natterman, Vinny Brand, reality TV, and the Stairway to Heaven plagiarism controversy.

The show continued with a caller's humorous contribution involving the phrase "cum in my ass," followed by a caller criticizing the media's focus on transgender surgery over veterans' needs, sparking a discussion about Chelsea Manning.  A substantial portion focused on listener-submitted misheard lyrics, beginning with a debate on whether a singer said "rain or me" or "rain on me," with a sidetrack on the unusual use of "cola" to rhyme with "Lola."  A listener then discussed a detail in Charlie Daniels Band's "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," currently playing live nearby.  Another caller explained the "Coca-Cola" lyric was a reference to a 70s drag bar.  This segued into discussions about song censorship, the New York Rangers (with one host showing strong fandom for Ron Duguay), and misheard lyrics in Blondie's "Rapture" (allegedly containing "finger fuck me").  A Philadelphia caller's outrage about the Rangers led to a discussion of hockey rivalries, including the Islanders' "Drive for Five."

The show then delved into a significant segment dedicated entirely to listener-submitted claims of misheard or obscured lyrics containing racial slurs or offensive language.  Listeners highlighted alleged slurs in songs by AC/DC ("Highway to Hell"), Garth Brooks ("Friends in Low Places"), Pearl Jam ("Yellow Ledbetter"), Billy Joel, The Beatles ("Girl"), The Rolling Stones ("Beast of Burden"), Starship ("We Built This City"), Van Halen, Pilot ("Magic"), and Dean Martin ("Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer").  The hosts played audio clips to attempt verification, and also discussed misheard lyrics claimed to be present in songs by Alice in Chains and Brenda Lee,  a squeaky chair sound in a Beatles song, and a broken rattle in an Aerosmith song.  The show concluded with a humorous segment focusing on a compilation of Reverend Al Sharpton's mispronounced words.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, everyone. Welcome aboard.  We're just looking at the Willis Tower story.  What was the headline on CNN?  Tower of Terror.  Tower of Terror.  Tower of Terror.  And I guess the news really isn't going to tell you exactly what's going on over there, right?  No, they want it to be sensational.  So they make it sound like...  So you've got to come up with a nice headline, Tower of Terror.  Nice graphic.  Yeah.  And then you... 
[00:00:30]  House of Horrors, Tower of Terror.  And then you completely lie to your audience.  Right.  That's what they do.  You make it sound like it was a harrowing experience.  They're teasing the fact that you could fall through.  It's the sky deck up there in Chicago.  We all did it.  It was a lot of fun.  It's like the glass cube that they push out.  Right.  Glass care.  Glass care.  They push it out the side of the building.  Right.  And you kind of, you know, walk out into it.  Did you do it?  And you're just kind of hovering up there.  No, I didn't go that day. 
[00:01:00]  It was great.  It's a lot of fun, actually.  We shot some video up there.  Some funny stuff.  And Sam was very, very scared to do it.  And I got clips out of Kenny doing a headstand and then panicking, begging us to get him  down immediately.  But the thing, it's a thing shattered or?  No, that's what they'd like you to believe, the news.  What?  I watch the news and I believe everything they tell me.  They said it shattered.  A family fell through, I guess.  Right?  Yeah, they plummeted to their death.  Because they tease that as well.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  You know, glass shatters while family's in sky deck.  Yeah.  So they want you to believe that the family actually fell 103 stories.  And that didn't happen.  The fact is, the truth here on this one, people, is they got some kind of coating on top, right?  Crisp crumb coating.  I don't understand the coating.  What is that made of?  It's some kind of glass.  It's another type of glass.  Glass, right.  Or plastic or something.  Because you got, I guess the biggest part of that thing is that it's got to be clean.  Right.  It's got to be clean and a scratch-free kind of a thing, or else it kind of ruins the illusion. 
[00:02:00]  Sure.  And they couldn't replace the actual bottom of the cube anytime something scratches.  Right, right.  So they have these thin coating of glass or plastic that goes over the actual glass.  Right.  And that cracked.  It went like...  So there's nothing going on there.  You could have still jumped up and down on top of it.  There's nothing going on there.  Nothing happened.  Sam, be on Red Alert today.  I want the news clips where they're making this way worse than it is. 
[00:02:30]  Terror, terror.  The tower of terror thing.  CNN just did the tower of terror.  How far is tower of terror.  But the fact is...  I told you how dangerous it was.  Huh?  I told you how dangerous it was.  Well, you did.  Would that have scared you of that if you were in that?  You heard crack in place?  Yes.  That would have been terrible.  Oh, they'd be cleaning the shit off of it.  But I think they should add that as one of the features.  Have the coating, you know, crack every once in a while.  Randomly for people to really, you know, get the full effect of how scary that could be.  Yeah.  But the fact remains that no one was falling to their death. 
[00:03:00]  It wasn't...  The sky deck itself wasn't, you know, cracking under that family's feet.  No.  It was the coating, like Anthony just, you know, explained.  So obviously they replaced those coatings a lot.  Yeah, I would gather.  Because people are scratching it up, scuffing it up.  Yeah.  And if they can't, you know, get it nice and shiny clean...  That's the whole selling point, is that it feels like you're kind of floating.  Right.  So you can't ruin it with scratches.  So after hours they take that layer off and they put a new layer on. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  That's all.  That's all that happened.  That's it.  It's a huge story today.  Like people were falling through it.  Terror, terror.  Tower, terror.  Tower of terror.  Terror.  Terror.  Coating on glass floor of Willis Tower, not the actual glass itself, cracks under Taurus.  All right.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Lots of stuff.  I saw all this stuff already.  Oh, shit.  Well, they say it's the glass coating.  Right.  I never heard of a glass coating until something cracked. 
[00:04:00]  And the display is closed.  They say, well, it's open, but then they say the people with access to doors are closed.  Take a look and listen.  103 stories above the ground.  Watch how they report it.  That's breaking underneath me.  I hear it.  I feel it.  Four cousins posed together for a picture on a glass observation deck overlooking Chicago.  It's cousins.  And the second they stood up.  I can feel the glass just shattering completely around my hand.  They looked back to see the surface they'd been sitting on, shattered. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, no way.  I'm going down with it.  I feel you can hear the cracking.  Any second I'm forward to.  They also got video of the glass literally cracking in front of their eyes.  They feared the ledge was about to fall to the ground.  Because you can see through it, obviously, you have the psychological effect that, you know, oh, my gosh, something broke.  Nobody was ever in danger.  Engineer Michael Swanberg says there's a thick panel of glass that didn't break, designed to withstand 10,000 pounds or five tons of weight. 
[00:05:00]  The rock.  We watched as crews replaced the thin layer above it that caused such a scare.  So this is the new sheet of glass that will go on the sky deck.  And if you look here, you can see exactly how thin that is.  Crews tell me that this is meant to be scratched and scraped up.  In fact, it's replaced every six to nine months, depending upon wear and tear.  But they still say tower 10.  You can see how the observation ledge extends just beyond the Willis Tower.  Coming up. 
[00:05:30]  With the new glass panel finally in place, we put it to the test.  So we are stepping onto that thin sheet of glass now.  That's correct.  The quarter-inch top-piece glass is designed to protect the one-and-a-half-inch thick structural glass.  Oh, my God.  Take the picture.  That's only one-and-a-half inches?  Now back in business.  And even these guys admit, after the scare of their lives...  For the record, it's an awesome view.  It's an awesome building.  It's the view from up top that made such an impression on them that they may just come back for more. 
[00:06:00]  So it's really not a story.  George Howell.  No.  CNN.  No.  Chicago.  But CNN is reporting it properly.  Right.  So I do...  But the graphics said...  I have to kind of apologize a little bit.  No, because the graphics said glass floor cracks a hundred-and-whatever stories.  That was to get you hooked into the story.  Right.  They're like, okay, we've got to tell the people what's really going on here.  Yeah.  All right.  They reported it properly.  But that's the first news report where they're reporting it properly. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Everyone else is kind of teasing the fact that there was a major issue there.  Yeah.  And people could have fallen to their deaths.  By the way, that's the same Skydeck box we were in, Sam.  I know that.  You noticed that, right?  Oh, shit.  I was the same one.  Oh, shit.  I feel vindicated.  Man of Questionable Reyes defecated on himself.  Why does this come back to defecation?  Questionable Reyes. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Yeah.  We'll be keeping tabs on that.  Keeping the news honest throughout the day with that story.  Glassgate?  Glassgate.  Glassgate.  Tower of Terror.  You ever been on Tower of Terror down there in Orlando?  So fun.  Scary, right?  Yeah.  What is that one now?  It's the one where they drop you at Twilight Zone, Tower of Terror.  Yeah, I don't do that shit.  I don't like that dropping shit.  No, I don't do that shit.  You went on that.  Yeah, it was fun.  And you can go, like, multiple times because the drop changes.  There's, like, six or 12 different...  What's different about falling? 
[00:07:30]  It starts and stops and starts and stops and starts and stops.  How about just get you to the bottom?  In a nice, slow...  It's just an elevator, yeah.  A real elevator.  Let's just do that.  It takes you down.  I'm just going to go up and down an elevator.  What was you?  Good enough for me.  I love the Tower of Terror.  Well, the Tower of Terror is in Chicago now.  That's the real Tower of Terror.  I don't love that at all.  Oh, shit.  It looks like, you know, it didn't even stop business up there.  You know why it didn't stop business up there?  Because they knew exactly what was going on.  Of course. 
[00:08:00]  You saw that when CNN was just doing that report,  well, the radio people didn't see.  But the studio audience we have saw.  Oh, that's right.  We don't do studio audiences anymore either.  That's right.  You know, as they're trying to do their piece,  people were enjoying the other Skydex that didn't have this thin coating of glass crack.  Right.  So they didn't even shut down the exhibit.  It seems to me if there is, like, the slightest little granule of something on that floor when they put that glass down. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  That it would be very easy to crack.  Oh, sure.  Because if it's elevated, even a little fucking fraction of a millimeter higher than the rest of it, and you step on it, it's going to crack.  Right.  They must really have to clean the shit out of that before they put it down.  I don't think there's a person not alive that, uh, not alive.  I mean, you would be scared shitless if that happened.  If it did happen, yes, Tower of Terror.  You would be scared.  Like, what the fuck?  But then someone would go, could tell you quickly, no, no, you were never in any danger. 
[00:09:00]  But if you hear, like, while you stand out there.  Oh, my God.  They should do that.  Yes.  It should be on your ticket.  Every once in a while, we're going to crack the glass underneath your feet.  Are you cool with this?  If not, then you can't do this.  Well, you just pipe in the sound over the PA system.  Just the sound of crack.  That broken glass sound.  What happened?  Or just be the asshole that just starts going, oh, my God, I think the glass is cracking.  Yeah.  That alone will get people panicking.  You could put it on your, uh, phone, the sound. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Record it on your phone, and then you stand there and just play it.  Right.  When other people ask.  Oh, she, it's like that.  Like someone threw a baseball through it.  He just picked the worst.  I know why he picked that one.  I love it.  I love it.  Oh, Stone Cold.  Is that Stone Cold?  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  All right, now it's fine.  Power of Terror.  Sorry.  Oh, what happened?  That's great.  Uh, that is funny.  I respect it.  That's where his brain went, when immediately, when you say glass shattering, you know, it's 
[00:10:00]  like Stone Cold.  Is that what he comes out to, that song?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he used to.  Well, does he still somewhere?  He did it.  Probably when he comes down for breakfast in the morning, he has that music play for  him, for himself.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Thank you guys for admitting you'd be scared on that thing.  You would shit your fucking pants.  Everyone would shit their pants, but our point is that no one was ever in danger.  Yeah, but this is the one time when the fucking media actually has it right, man.  If you're on that thing and it's a hundred and fucking three stories up and that thing 
[00:10:30]  starts spidering, you would fucking die.  I'd start jumping up and down and go, come on.  That's right.  Break, bitch.  That's right.  I'd fucking laugh.  Yeah, Chip.  Yeah.  Take the glass.  That's right.  Fuck it up.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mikey Queens as we move on to the other huge story this morning.  Mikey.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  How you doing?  All right.  Who does that?  Wendy Williams?  How you doing? 
[00:11:00]  You guys haven't seen that?  Her entire show is how you doing?  Can you find out how you doing?  Isn't that Joey from Friends?  Wasn't he the originator?  I don't know.  It's her thing now, man.  Or how you doing, Yankees?  Oh, God.  Hey, Kaminoosh.  You didn't like that?  No.  Terrible.  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:11:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  What is she doing?  How you doing?  Como esta?  How you doing?  Why does she make that face?  How you doing?  You doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Como esta?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:12:00]  Why is she doing this?  It's also the same episode?  She does a lot on every episode.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Is that like a thing?  Yeah, she's been doing this since she was on the radio.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  All right, how long is this?  I don't sound like that, do I?  Chinese have come a long way, though, man.  They have nothing to complain about if they're big TV stars now on TV.  Really smoothing out those necks, huh?  Yeah.  They're doing a great job with the surgery and everything. 
[00:12:30]  What's up, Mikey?  Oh, well, you know, Donald Sterling, at least he gets something good out of this.  You know, that team was worth $500,000.  They have a terrible stadium deal for another nine years.  And he gets $2 billion.  You mean $500 million?  They were worth $500 million by Forbes, the most he would have got last week.  Before this scandal, he would have got $900 million.  Now he gets $2 billion.  He actually makes $1.1 billion extra.  Well, you know, the NBA is really making him suffer for his comments. 
[00:13:00]  Hayata.  Hayata.  Hayata.  Hayata.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  This is so bad.  Yeah, this is nice.  Well, anyway, Mikey.  Yeah, the NBA wanted him to suffer, and he's certainly suffering by making $2 billion for his team. 
[00:13:30]  You've got the Microsoft guy that bought it, right?  Is this official?  Not yet.  But it's looking good?  He wanted to buy the Kings.  The guy, I mean, if he tries to stand in the way of this, he's an idiot.  But the guy that bought the Microsoft one and moved the Sacramento Kings to Seattle, he was only going to pay $600,000 for that team.  The most was $500,000.  $600,000.  You keep saying $100,000, you mean $100 million.  Million.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Wait.  So, I don't think there's a sports franchise out there that's worth $2 billion. 
[00:14:00]  Dodgers are the only one higher.  $2.1 million.  Oh, really?  That was the only one sold in 2012, yeah.  The Yankees would go for more than $2 billion.  Yeah, but Dallas Cowboys probably would, too.  Dallas Cowboys and Yankees.  But not the Clippers, Red Sox.  But why the Clippers?  The Clippers have the worst stadium deal, also.  They've got nine years left on that terrible deal that they share with the Lakers.  Right.  This is a force.  Because they don't go on their NBA team for sale.  And it's a force, too. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  It's the only NBA team for sale.  It's, they want this guy gone.  Right.  So he can name his own fucking price.  Right.  Oh, you don't want to pay that much?  Then fuck you, I'll stay.  Right.  He didn't even name the price.  It was one of the most powerful groups against another powerful group.  A bidding war.  Steve Jobs' ex-wife and Oprah Winfrey and all these, David Geffen against Steve Ballmer  who wanted a toy.  Right.  He's not going to make money off of this.  Isn't he worth like $20 billion, this guy?  Oh, yeah.  And he tried to buy the Sacramento Kings and move them to Seattle, and he lost out on that. 
[00:15:00]  So now he's, you know, gets this $2 billion toy.  Yeah, thank you.  If you're worth $20 billion, I don't think you care that much about a profit on a $2 billion  sports franchise.  Exactly.  I can't imagine how that's going to make money for him anytime soon.  Or at least get his money back.  Dude, how do you make a billion dollars back on the Clippers?  All right.  I don't know.  I hope they're terrible next year.  But, you know, the NBA, congratulations to them. 
[00:15:30]  And they really are making Donald Sterling suffer.  I'm going to start fucking saying horrible racist stuff behind the scenes.  Yes.  Hopefully I can profit from it.  I hope the new guy just shows up in, like, a Gestapo uniform, goose steps in, just wearing  Nazi regalia.  What did Sterling pay for the team?  I forgot.  Something like $15 million?  $10.  That's what I heard.  No?  How much did he?  I think he paid, what, around $15 million for the team? 
[00:16:00]  $15 million.  Something like that?  That is an investment.  Wow.  And he's a lawyer.  Fuck your 401.  This Donald Sterling knows how to make money.  My God.  You put in a few million.  Right.  And then you liberally sprinkle in some racist words.  Right.  And you walk away with a couple of billion.  A couple of bill.  But he doesn't want to sell the team still.  It's the wife.  Yeah.  Yeah, but now, you know.  He might still go against the Board of Governors and selling it. 
[00:16:30]  Which cabinet?  But who knows?  Yeah.  Is that all?  Yeah.  I was just thinking.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because I was watching on CNN.  His lawyer was on.  Basically saying that Donald's fighting this shit.  Exactly.  And then you wake up this morning and say this deal is pretty much a done deal.  They just got to sign some shit.  So I...  Wouldn't you say you're fighting it if you want it to get the best price?  I guess.  I don't know.  It's like, well, we've got to throw a lot of money at this fuck. 
[00:17:00]  Has Donald Sterling said anything about this deal?  Yes.  He's still going to fight it.  It's the wife that's selling it.  I don't know why he would fight it now.  Two billion dollars.  You can't...  Yeah, I mean, he's all 90...  He's saying that he's mentally incapacitated, so he can't function the team anyway.  He can't function as a human being.  That's not true.  We've all...  Yeah, I know.  We've all heard him over the last month.  Buy me out.  I buy you out.  Right. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe you guys should buy the team.  Oh.  Yeah, huh?  Really?  Scrape up some shekels.  Really?  All right, Mikey.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  There's probably one person in this building that could afford it.  Are we?  And he's not here today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's too busy talking about how great the clogging family was.  Who is that guy?  What?  Oh, my God.  Was there a clogging family on America's Got Talent?  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  And he was just praising them as the greatest clogging family ever.  I appreciate good clogging, Robin.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  You know what's really good?  That river dance.  I love river dance.  Oh, no.  It's clogging.  Oh, clogging.  Clogging.  You know, they're fucking tap dancing with clogs on, I guess.  I don't know.  I can't see.  Can you remember that TV?  Every clogging dance should end like fucking...  In the Willis Tower.  Like misery. 
[00:18:30]  Like James Caan in a mallet.  I don't think this is the clogging family there.  Is there a different clogger?  Oh, yeah.  What are they doing?  How many cloggers are there?  There's been many cloggers over the years.  Cloggers.  There's a bunch of toilets, and they just...  That's a good one.  Mars, we'll never use that new technology.  Yes, thanks.  The only thing that was done for us...  I never look over there. 
[00:19:00]  The only thing that was done for us over the break, we're never going to use that technology.  Because when you put the computer on the TV, you lose the quality big time.  Yes.  Ah!  I always thought this was one of the greatest things you've seen.  I love this stuff.  Boo-hoo.  I don't know if this video will have his comments, which will have just fucking brutal.  Are the girls hot, at least?  Oh, great.  It's a family entertainment, Robert.  It's just basically tap dancing. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  Wow.  You made clogging up really hot.  Wow.  It's inspiring.  It's fun.  It's talent.  You guys are great.  I want to see you again.  Yeah.  Wow.  I want to see you again.  Wowie kazowie.  He's judging...  Same guy, huh?  That's the same guy.  He's fucking a 2014 gong show. 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  I know we all change as we grow, but that's a drastic change in my book.  He's the new J.P. Morgan.  The new Jamie Farr out there with a gong and a fucking mallet.  I'm going to put a mallet, Anthony.  Get it?  I still look...  How many times today?  There's never too many mallet references.  Clogging.  Shit.  Clogging.  When you said...  I would be bored out of my mind if I saw them clogging. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, God.  Who cares?  They're all in sync.  I want to see you again.  Do you really?  Do you?  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Good for him.  Is he nice on that show?  I've never seen it.  Well, he was supposed to be like the mean Piers Morgan guy, and then he decided he's going  to be nice or something, and it fucked up everything.  And I think that's one reason why the show just doesn't do as well as it used to.  Didn't he used to fucking...  Didn't he used to have a Channel 9 show where he waved a fucking fried chicken on the end 
[00:21:00]  of a fishing pole in front of black people?  Well, yeah.  People are allowed to change, though.  He had the KKK guy.  Yeah.  Wake up, white people.  But now, last season, a little kid was crying on stage, and he went up and consoled him and  said everything would be okay.  Get one of his surplus kiddies.  Uh-oh.  Brent Michaels rushed to the hospital.  God damn.  What goes on with this guy?  Jesus.  Rocker rushed to the hospital.  Something full on his head?  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  Anyway.  Keep your posts on that one.  Yeah.  Tower of terror.  We love you, Miramani.  Thank you.  Yes?  I have no problem speaking.  First of all, you're a very nice young man.  You know that.  No one likes hitting the X on a seven-year-old.  You're very brave to get up there at seven years old.  Three of them.  Oh, he's crying.  Big scary man made you cry. 
[00:22:00]  That's a mean man.  I'll fix everything.  I'll fix everything.  Let me fix everything.  I'll fix everything.  I'm sorry, my man.  I'm so sorry.  Aw, that's sweet.  You're a terrific young man.  You are so brave.  You are wonderful.  This job is too rough for me.  I don't really want to do it. 
[00:22:30]  This is what he wishes his father said to him.  Aw.  You're a terrific kid.  Did you know that?  Yes.  No.  Yes.  I'm going to be honest with you.  I don't want to make you cry.  Okay.  You know what, near money?  It's funny.  I've met many great rappers.  I'm on the radio.  I interview them.  Oh, shut up.  I, me.  I, me.  Me again.  I.  What do you think of me?  So what happened with the kid?  I'm talking about me.  What about you?  Huh?  Did he boot the kid off, I hope?  That's old shit. 
[00:23:00]  Who cares?  Oh, man.  He didn't win the fucking thing.  I want to follow him who got the boot that day.  I'll tell you one thing.  Dan Natterman killed it on America's Got Talent.  Our pal Dan Natterman.  I didn't see that.  I heard he was going to be on it.  Jimmy's pal Dan Natterman.  Dan Natterman is a very, very funny guy.  He killed it on America's Got Talent.  What was he on?  He got some heat.  I'm not going to expose anything, but he was hilarious.  Yes, he was.  On a segment of Jimmy's project.  I got Dan Natterman on his rise to start-up.  Yes.  Hello. 
[00:23:30]  Hi.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Okay.  What's your name?  Dan Natterman.  This appearance is going to make him huge.  I live in New York City.  You do?  And he's moved on.  I live in New York City.  He's moved on, so you'll see him again.  His delivery is great.  I'm going to do a comedy act.  Comedy act.  Okay.  I love comedy.  Well, all right.  He is funny.  Well, I guess I'll talk about myself.  I'm 44, never been married.  People ask me why I've never been married. 
[00:24:00]  Good question.  Probably because I talk to married people all the time.  And you know what I'm not hearing?  Enthusiasm.  Ain't nobody selling this marriage thing.  You wouldn't buy any other product if people talked about it the same way people talk about  being married.  Like if you went to buy a car and the salesman was like, well, this car, it's not easy.  It's not easy.  You know?  You really got to work hard.  It takes a lot of work.  And there'll be good days and bad days with this car.  But don't give up.  It's funny.  I ask married people all the time, how do you like being married? 
[00:24:30]  At best, you know what I hear?  So far, so good.  At best.  I ask people, how do you like Game of Thrones?  They're like, oh my God.  I try to meet women on the internet.  Anybody do the internet?  You got to be careful on the internet.  People lie to you on the internet.  Now, what's the number one lie on the internet?  People lie about their age on the internet.  And then they'll put up like an old picture from like 1982.  And then they look young in a picture.  And then you meet them.  And they're 78 years old. 
[00:25:00]  That's why I tell women I meet online.  Look, send me a picture of you holding today's paper.  He's not as good as the cloggers.  Or at least an iPhone 4, for God's sake.  One picture I saw on the internet, the Berlin Wall was in the background.  And it was under construction.  Thank you, everybody.  That's it for me.  That was very good. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, he's very funny.  He gets a standing ovation, too.  He's going to do very well.  This dude's funny.  This dude's funny.  Your boy in the camp.  Yeah.  Sam Waltz.  That's Sam's boy in the camp.  Yep.  You are a really likable guy.  I especially like the speed.  It's very good.  Can you climb?  Hang on to every word to get what you were saying.  Because I'm a little slow. 
[00:26:00]  Well, your English is not your native tongue.  Exactly.  We're looking for the next million dollar talent.  We're looking for someone great.  You fit the bill.  Every joke was rock solid.  You've got it all.  You've got the delivery.  Your likability is there.  And you've got great material.  Home run, home run, home run.  Welcome.  You're going to do great.  Thank you.  You're going to do great.  Appreciate it.  Wow.  You're not allowed to do the Opie and Anthony show.  You're really, really funny.  Simple as that. 
[00:26:30]  Is that Spice?  You know what you are when I look at you and listen to you?  Jerry Spice.  No, I love Jerry Spice.  Jerry Spice.  Fucking asshole.  It would be you.  I'm going to start the voting.  I'm going to say yes.  Now, I have to give you a yes.  Thank you.  And I'm going to give you a yes, too.  I vote yes.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Wow.  You do what you want.  There you go.  Dan.  Damn.  Yeah.  Good for Dan.  That was last night?  That was a couple days ago. 
[00:27:00]  Good for Dan.  Last week.  I don't remember the fuck it was.  That's pretty good.  He's on the Comedy Cellar podcast, which is on SiriusXM.  I don't know when they play it.  Very hard to do stand-up that quickly.  You've got to be clean.  Yeah, totally clean.  Controversy-free.  And you only get 90 seconds, I think.  They'll probably edit you down for, I'm guessing, three or four minutes.  But be able to be likable and everything.  Right.  That's pretty hard to do.  I don't think they edit you down.  Isn't that live or something?  Oh, is it?  Is that live?  Not the auditions. 
[00:27:30]  Not the auditions?  No?  Yeah, they probably are.  Fuck me running.  They probably want the best stuff possible, so they probably let you go a little longer.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Our pal Vinny Brand was on Last Comic Standing.  I saw a picture of Vinny last night.  What was he doing?  Why was he on that?  He was competing.  Vinny's on Last Comic Standing?  Yeah.  There's a lot of legit comics.  He's 55 years old.  Yeah.  But there's a lot of legit comics that are doing that now.  Yeah, it's real.  It's not like the amateurs like it was when Dat Phan was.  Yeah, it's really.  Dat Phan.  Jimmy Schubert passed.  Yeah, Schubert's on it. 
[00:28:00]  I know DC Benny was on it.  Yeah, he was on last night.  I apologize.  I thought it was for the kids, that show.  It's an invitational.  How'd he do?  They didn't air his full set.  Oh.  Did he pass?  I'm not sure.  That's not good.  I hope so.  I didn't even know Last Comic Standing was still on the air.  I know.  Did they bring it back or something?  I think J.B. Smoove is hosting.  They bring it back?  Yeah.  Yeah, J.B. Smoove is hosting, and the judges are Russell Peters, Keenan Ivory Waynes, and 
[00:28:30]  Roseanne.  Roseanne who?  Barr.  Roseanne?  Roseanne.  This show doesn't sound good.  Sounds awful.  Sorry.  Our friend, Russell Peters, is the judge.  Our friend is the contestant.  I'm happy for him.  It's crazy.  This is like 10 seconds of Vinnie Brand.  All right.  I drove my 25-year-old home from college, one and a half hour drive.  In that one and a half hours, she talked for two and a half hours. 
[00:29:00]  He's a good stand-up, Vinnie.  That's a funny joke.  Yeah.  Did he make it through?  Um...  Eagerly awaiting the results.  Yeah, I don't...  Ladies and gentlemen, Vinnie Brand.  I don't see his name on this...  Oh, man.  No?  That's too bad.  Oh, he's a good egg.  He is a good egg.  We like Vinnie.  Good for Vinnie Brand.  What?  The show just sounds horrible. 
[00:29:30]  Why?  Because it did well for a while.  Why are they bringing it back?  I'm guessing it's cheap.  They always do that.  But why don't they just, uh...  I don't know, come up with a different concept.  A common lunch?  Yeah.  Did she make it through?  Um...  She might have.  That was last week's show.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah, right now they're going through the, like, invitationals, you know, and then they'll move on to the...  I don't know.  Jimmy Schubert did make it through.  Oh, okay.  And how about D.C.?  D.C. Benny?  Don't know. 
[00:30:00]  Don't know.  That was last night.  Funny guys.  Yeah, they're all funny.  He had a good set.  No one's watching this.  Is there a house?  No.  No, they don't do the house.  All right.  Good, good.  No more house.  Well, that was funny with Rich and his ironing.  If they let comedians just kind of hang out and be literally the caustic tricks that comedians  are, that would be really funny.  Right.  And the closest they had to it was Rich.  Boss.  Yeah.  He was funny.  He was giving people shit.  Yeah, that's when the show did some good ratings, so...  Yeah.  Some of these shows, though, you're right.  I had no idea they're still on. 
[00:30:30]  Apparently, is Survivor still on?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah, I...  That's insanity.  Who was watching that?  I heard it on one of my TVs.  Did you...  Do you ever hear anyone talking about it?  No.  What are the numbers for that?  Big Brother is still on.  What?  That's such an instant machine.  They just fucking throw people in.  But they just, they decided, they accepted much lower numbers.  Oh, yeah.  Because when it first hit, everybody was watching Survivor.  We were at N.E.W.  It's huge.  So this show's been on the air almost 15 years, probably.  It's got to be one of those shows that they don't need amazing ratings because it's cheap. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  How is Survivor cheap?  Flying people all over the world, unless they're doing it in, like, Detroit now.  And haven't they run out of islands?  Yeah.  They had to run out of islands by now.  And who's on it?  Is Probst still on it?  I think so, yeah.  Our old pal Probst.  Yeah, Jeff Probst's sister.  But that's the only salary they have to pay.  They don't actually have to pay actors.  So what are the numbers?  I mean, it's still...  From the first few years to where are they at now?  Well, right now...  I couldn't name one contestant on that.  You used to know everyone's names on that show. 
[00:31:30]  They're still doing 9.5 million views.  Are they really?  That's pretty good.  Which puts them in second place.  This was Wednesday.  Did Richard Hatch win first?  I don't know one person that's watching this show.  No one talks about it.  Who's watching this?  Yeah, but...  No one talks about it.  You couldn't...  You couldn't, like...  You couldn't avoid Survivor talk.  Yeah.  When it first hit.  And that number was, I think, closer to, like, 15, 20 million easily.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Easily, right?  It was a phenomenon.  So it's probably half the number at this point?  Yeah, I would definitely say that.  Well, that's still a huge hit for those guys.  Good for them.  But I couldn't tell you anything about it.  I don't know what island they're on.  I don't know any of the contestants.  No.  Do they still do the same challenges, or they mix it up a little bit?  The Isle of Staten.  That would be...  Right.  You could set them loose in Staten Island.  It's the Toad Hill Road Challenge.  Yes.  They have to try to buy a house in Toad Hill Road without getting punched in the face. 
[00:32:30]  Try to afford to get over the bridge.  It's very expensive.  I know.  It's a much better joke than my stupid pseudo-mafia joke.  No.  But, I mean, it's the same.  Even American Idol now, like, the whole point of that show is that the winner gets to go on and be a famous singer.  Yeah.  Nobody even knows who wins.  No one knows anymore.  American Idol anymore.  Who are the judges on Idol?  It's Harry...  I thought I just called it Idol.  I should have my fucking T-popped up.  Harry Connick Jr.  Oh.  Oh, he's cool.  Wait, what is this show now?  Idol.  Oh, American Idol.  That's still on.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  One of the douchiest scenes in movie history in Independence Day with Harry Connick Jr.  Where he's walking with fucking Will Smith to their aircraft.  Right.  And he goes, you got the celebration, the fucking thing, the cigar.  Kick the tires and light the fires.  Light the fires, big daddy.  He calls him big daddy like it's his bitch.  One douche moment after another.  It was so bad.  And then he's like, I got it right here.  Ah, fucking douche.  You didn't like Robert Lozier in that? 
[00:33:30]  Ah.  Get on the horn.  Let everyone know how to take down them sons of bitches.  Yuck.  I preferred him.  I give you a ten million dollar star.  I know.  That's the Robert Lozier I like.  So fucked up.  You know who won American Idol is the kid who called his Twitter followers retards.  Remember when he played that clip?  He won this thing.  Did he apologize?  He won.  He won.  He took it back.  He took it back.  But we don't even know that.  Yeah, but he won.  Why don't we know he won that? 
[00:34:00]  Because, I mean, I don't.  No one knows who won fucking.  We have to be on.  We have to be on top of all this stuff.  Yeah.  For our jobs.  And I don't even know.  I mean, the voice is over, too.  I don't know.  There's a winner.  Do you know anyone who's ever won the voice?  No.  I don't know anyone who's ever won the voice.  Who is?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  And you're cool with me.  I forgot.  See, I know everything.  It was perfect.  Well, I'm supposed to know that stuff.  Yeah, we said there, and I don't even know.  Like, you expect us not to know, but I don't even know.  I'm in a different demo than you. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  You know more about Led Zeppelin than me.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Jimmy Page is saying the Stairway to Heaven lawsuit is bullshit.  Of course he is.  See?  Fucking stealing riffs.  What's he going to do?  He has to say that.  He can't come out and go, oh, finally come back to bite me.  Right.  Exactly.  He's got to.  He's saying it's all bullshit.  No, just coincidence.  You know what, though?  If you take it and make it huge, you know.  Fuck that guy.  It just sounds exactly like it, but it's just, it worked out that way.  Fuck that other guy. 
[00:35:00]  It wasn't intentional.  Whoever he is.  Let's see.  To Jimmy Page, the song remains the same.  Get it?  Get it?  The Led Zeppelin guitarist has tersely rejected the recently reported claim that his band copied  its 1971 classic rock Touchstone Stairway to Heaven from the Los Angeles band Spirit,  their former tour mates.  He commented, clothed in cashmere.  No?  He tried to just fit in as many awkward titles. 
[00:35:30]  Petting his black dog.  Oh, is that Jimmy Page?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  He called the charges in French publication Liberation, according to an online translator.  I have no further comment on the subject.  What is the, can we hear the, just real quick, the spirit version?  Can we know what his version sounds like?  What's, this is the spirit version, so he really ripped it off.  But Jimmy, what about all the other ones where you actually added names to the liner notes?  Ah, you know, it's just, you just do it.  Hey.  No reason. 
[00:36:00]  Throw him a bone.  Yeah, put a name, doesn't hurt anyone.  Throw him a bone.  Uh, spirit song was Taurus.  Ding, ding, ding.  Jimmy Page is like, eh, can't really use this.  Right.  Can't really use this, but.  Ah.  Ah.  No.  Hey, Jethro Tull ripped this off. 
[00:36:30]  Right, fucker.  But is there a part of it that they took?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've seen nothing like it.  No, no, no.  Totally different.  Can't use this.  I'm lying.  Can't use this.  Oh, no, it's this is.  It doesn't sound nothing like our song.  Totally different.  Oh.  Hi, yeah.  Oh, well, now this.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Don't hear it.  Oh. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I don't like it at all.  Come on.  What do you, he didn't know how to end the riff.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  That's what Paige had.  She knew how to end the riff.  Right.  Yeah.  This show blows monkey ass.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Spirit.  Shut up.  But that's obviously really, really so similar. 
[00:37:30]  But Paige added the end of it.  Just go, yeah, Paige knew how to fucking end it.  All right.  And then you get the singing going.  We both fought a lot.  I never heard that song.  Yeah.  They opened.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, they did.  I was outside.  See, and you had a little.  Some tootley-doos.  Yeah.  This is better.  Ooh.  All right.  Let me hear a spirit again.  Ah. 
[00:38:00]  This guy's just doing, like, a scale thing.  Fuck him.  Fuck him where he lives.  Right there should have been.  Right.  He doesn't even know what he's doing here.  But it's almost like Zeppelin has taken so many songs.  They take some good parts, and then they fucking gussy them up.  And make them, you know.  Yeah.  Huge fucking songs. 
[00:38:30]  Imagine someone calls something and whip them out Tuesday.  Oh.  What do you mean imagine?  It doesn't.  Well, yeah.  But I'm sorry.  We had people do all that shit.  But that's it.  It's like they've taken something.  Yeah.  But everyone knows who the originators are.  Certainly.  Spirit.  Spirit.  Yeah.  Good point.  Do they claim that Zeppelin took any other part of that song?  Because that's the only part we know.  That's it.  I think it's just the riff.  Just the riff.  That's it.  Yeah.  Good luck.  What about when the song starts rocking out? 
[00:39:00]  Where do they get that part from?  That's right.  The guy will probably start recalling conversations they had while they were on the road.  Jimmy asked me what was wrong.  I said there was a bustle in my hedgerow.  I didn't sleep well.  Boo.  Yeah, we got it.  Loud and clear.  Loud and queer. 
[00:39:30]  That joke was not good.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  What about this part?  Little air guitar right here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Mark Goodman's pressing the button.  There he is.  What, the free trial thing? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  But only Fox airs the commercial.  They got, what, a special deal with Fox?  I guess so.  Yeah, Sirius XM's commercial with Mark Goodman.  It's nice to be reminded of where you walk when you're going to take a dump when you watch TV at night.  It's like, oh, that's the only way I'd walk to take a dump.  Yeah.  Do you know how many times I've seen that right there?  Yeah.  While my asshole was still itching?  Buckering.  Strangely, there's no button there.  No.  When we walk by there.  There's just tape residue from where they came out. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, where they just ripped it off the wall.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you can still see.  They haven't even cleaned the tape?  You can still see where they taped the button to the fucking console.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's eat some food.  Yep.  Continue with some other things.  Rightio.  All right.  Good old Gnarles.  Fuck you.  I'm Nas Barkley.  That was one of the bits.  See those?  He's only 40.  Ain't that some shit?  Damn. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Happy birthday.  Fuck you.  Trey Parker's 42 today.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Of Matt and Trey fame.  Wow.  He's 42.  I'd have thought he was older, quite frankly.  Yeah.  How long have they been famous?  Fuck.  Yeah, because we discovered.  I mean, we...  What was he, 20-fucking-2?  I guess, because we were at AF when we first heard about South Park and Matt and Trey.  Early, too.  Like, maybe 96-ish, I want to say. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, the Jesus Santa.  Four, 18.  Earlier than that.  Yeah.  It's almost 20 years, South Park, I think.  18, 19 years in, right?  Yeah.  So he was 23, 24.  Damn.  Well, 96 would be almost twice, but 18 years ago.  Yep.  Right.  But I think it was, like, 93 when South Park started.  93, 94, and now.  I don't think so.  All right.  I'll look it up.  I don't either.  Not South Park.  No.  The Jesus thing.  But that was underground and, you know, got its cult following.  And then it kind of went mainstream.  Comedy Central. 
[00:42:00]  The Jesus Santa thing was early on.  I'll tell you why I know.  South Park was 97.  Yeah, because me and Anthony got South Park clips before they were even airing South Park.  Uh-huh.  And we started dropping them in between songs.  And people were like, what the fuck is that?  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were lucky enough to get those through one of our pals.  And they kind of were telling us this show we think is going to be pretty big.  And they kind of pushed some clips forward to some shows.  No, I don't even think to some shows.  I think literally we were one of the only ones. 
[00:42:30]  I know.  One of the only ones.  An exclusive.  We were playing Cartman.  Cartman.  Cartman drops.  Cartman.  And people were like, what the fuck?  You do.  And I know that was before the show hit.  The show hit in 97, you're saying?  Yeah.  17 years then.  Okay.  What are we going to talk about?  RuPaul?  Are we going to talk about the radio show in Rochester?  What do you want to do?  Oh, the RuPaul stuff's pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Finally, you know.  People talking about language.  Somebody talking about language.  Being brave and talking about language.  Yep.  Well, RuPaul's been around for years.  Been the mainstream tranny, really.  What's that?  Quite frankly.  Who?  What?  Was that a...  Who did you just say?  What did you just say?  Tim McCarver?  Or...  Who's the baseball announcer that just retired?  Tim McCarver?  Tim McCarver.  I think he just walked by with a cup of coffee.  Oh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I hope it's cold. 
[00:43:30]  Tim McCarver.  No reason.  I don't want him to have cold coffee.  Is this a dick thing to wish on someone's coffee?  I think it was him.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Anyway, sorry.  Yeah.  Uh, RuPaul.  RuPaul being a mainstream tranny.  Right.  For years.  And, um, commenting on how this language thing is getting out of hand.  It's Orwellian.  Orwellian.  Whoa.  As far as the, um, gay, lesbian, transgender community goes. 
[00:44:00]  Um, RuPaul says, uh, this is getting way out of hand.  It's not a community.  It's, uh, the word tranny isn't a problem for him.  And, uh, shouldn't be for anyone else.  And he says, uh, he says, like, I'm a tranny about himself.  He's like, it's not just transsexual or trans, like, transvestite.  Yeah, transvestite.  I've been a tranny for 30 years.  Yeah, yeah.  And the tweet, one tweet was great.  Uh, Orwell's book, Animal Farm. 
[00:44:30]  The pigs didn't really want a revolution.  They just wanted to be Farmer John.  And Ru tweeted out, I guess, about the gay movement or the attitude of this language repression.  Yeah, yeah.  It's nice to see people.  See people.  How could you not, how could you shit on RuPaul if you're a fucking, yeah, a gay activist?  Like, it's all these young babies on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  So we can start saying tranny again?  I never stopped.  All right.  I'll have to tell Jimmy. 
[00:45:00]  I said it earlier when we were talking about Wendy Williams.  Yes.  It's kind of funny.  Put it on a Loom like that.  Put it on a Loom like that.  If I didn't know any better, I would swear she was a tranny.  Yes.  Doing a TV show.  I would really bet a lot of money on that one.  No problem.  No problem. 
[00:45:30]  How long has RuPaul been around?  32 years.  I've done two TV shows with Ru.  No pun intended.  We did Chelsea Lately today when Ru was dressed.  And I was like, oh, he's going to be an asshole because he's just really tall.  I was like, oh, fuck.  But very, very personable.  And then at Fox one time, we were doing Red Eye.  It was when Greg used to have you step out and the guests would come in for the interview.  Remember that?  Those days.  And Ru was the guest.  But Ru was dressed just like a guy that day. 
[00:46:00]  Like in a suit jacket.  All freckly faced.  Yeah, it was weird.  All freckly faced Ru.  And I saw him once out in public.  Me and Jonathan were out in L.A.  And he was eating like in a something potlay.  And I'm like, Jonathan's like, that's RuPaul.  And I'm like, nobody recognized him.  I'm like, what a great gig.  You can just kind of go out and live your life.  Yeah, yeah.  And just dress up and you're fabulous.  Fabulous.  Well, speaking of trannies, I guess that does lead to the firing of another radio show. 
[00:46:30]  This one's a, it's not even a tough one for me.  Kimberly and Beck are fucking twats, losers.  But they got fired.  Kick them in when they're down.  Fuck them.  They took some major cheap shots at my boy Brother Wee's up there in Rochester.  Oh, that was them.  They were real, real cunts toward him.  For no good reason, by the way.  Just making up shit and then telling lies on their radio show.  And they're the show that got fired up there in Rochester.  Oh, shit.  What'd they say? 
[00:47:00]  So, I haven't heard this audio.  I've read the article.  So, let's see if they should have been fired.  Not right.  I don't like them.  We'll be the judge.  But I'll have an open mind as far as a radio show goes and whether or not they should be fired.  Dicks.  Hey, the city of Rochester...  Yeah, so this is what kind of fire right here.  This is the actual clip.  All right.  Let's listen.  There's a few clips here on the topic.  Hey, the city of Rochester, you should be feeling good about this.  Using your tax dollars to extend transition-related health care coverage to its employees who are transgender and gender non-conforming. 
[00:47:30]  What the hell does that mean?  That means if you want to change...  Like, you're not a woman or a man?  If you're a man and you want to change into being a woman, or if you're a woman and want, you know, some appendage added,  they can probably do that for you in the city of Rochester.  Mayor Lovely Warren...  It's going to be covered by the health insurance.  Mayor Lovely Warren made that announcement. 
[00:48:00]  It's been approved by the city's Labor Management Health Care Committee.  The new coverage, if you are a city of Rochester employee...  So far, so good.  ...will pay for services related to your gender reassignment surgery.  Mm-hmm.  What?  So the dude can look like a lady, and the city is going to pay for it.  All right.  You're, you're tax dollars at work.  Woo! 
[00:48:30]  All right.  So mostly a new story.  That was nothing.  There's got to be more than that.  There's got to be.  Yeah, there's more coming.  So far, they're a bunch of dicks, but I don't think they should have been fired for that.  Not a firing offense right there.  But we are getting to the point where, when you say, I don't necessarily agree with that,  that will eventually become, well, you got to go.  Right.  Yeah.  Let's see if it gets worse.  Does that mean then they'll also, if women want to have a boob job, they'll pay for the  boob job?  Because I think that's only right. 
[00:49:00]  The services that will be paid for under the new coverage, gender reassignment surgery,  psychological counseling, because you're probably a nut job to begin with.  Uh-oh.  That's my opinion.  Hormone.  That's my opinion.  You're allowed to have your opinion.  She added that part.  So, God, I hate this fucking bitch.  So this is hard for me, because she is a twat.  Is she hot?  I don't know.  I don't give a fuck.  How things are clear?  Pop her face up on that fucking screen, Samuel.  Zoom in on the bikini crotch.  We have different priorities, but I mean, you used to be able to voice your opinion 
[00:49:30]  on a radio show, and she even said, that is my opinion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She thinks you're a nut job if you want that done.  A nut job.  You should be able to say that, even though you're a fucking twat.  Isn't that part of the treatment?  If you want to become a woman, you have to get a nut job.  See?  All fired.  Counseling, because you're probably a nut job to begin with.  That's my opinion.  Hormone therapy, cosmetic, and reconstructive surgery. 
[00:50:00]  So let me get this straight.  A lot of women who have breast cancer sometimes have to fight with the freaking insurance company  to get their breasts redone, right?  Right.  Because whether or not they're lopsided, because you just have the cancer removed,  or maybe you have to have complete removal,  sometimes those insurance companies want to be a pain in the backside.  Will the city then cover that cost?  Will the city cover that cost?  I don't know.  That's not...  That cost?  She didn't make any mention of that. 
[00:50:30]  I mean, I think some insurance companies do.  Some you have to fight with for reconstructive surgery if you have cancer.  All right.  So we're two minutes into the...  Nut job is what did it.  Nut job, in my opinion...  Doesn't matter.  And...  That's it.  Yeah, but that...  I hate these fucking people, but she should not be fired for what she has said so far.  Yeah, and then she has a very viable argument about the insurance companies  not covering people with, you know, medical problems.  Instead of, like, firing her for saying that she thinks that if you're transgender, 
[00:51:00]  that you're a nut job, well, then how about you...  It's like, that's what a lot of people think.  That is what a lot of people think.  And maybe it's the wrong opinion, but that's literally the opinion a lot of people have.  What, are you going to fire everybody who thinks that and just doesn't say it?  Yes, Jimmy.  I don't know how you do a radio show at this point.  I just don't know how you do it.  If that is a firing offense, man, did we used to get away with murder.  Of course.  Just groveling in there, fucking...  Just groveling. 
[00:51:30]  It continues here.  Let's see if it gets worse.  There's an area high school that has a transsexual boy playing on the girls' varsity softball team.  It's not right.  Kimberly and Beck, I'm a skinny girl trapped in a fat girl's  body.  Will the city pay for liposuction?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  They're kind of shitty at doing bits, but they're trying to do bits.  Yeah, I'm not looking at the quality of their radio.  Yeah, they're shitty bits.  Trying to make some jokes now. 
[00:52:00]  There's no hate in their voices, really.  What is the softball team player?  What was that again?  A boy, a transgendered, I guess, boy to girl, playing on the girls' softball team.  Yeah.  But there was a big controversy about this in MMA, when there was, I think someone had  gone through the full surgery.  Right.  But Rogan was such a smart point about being born with a certain bone structure.  Right.  And it wasn't about bigotry.  It was about there's a physical difference in bone structure and ligament strength. 
[00:52:30]  And Job was really smart, the way he...  Fat on your butt.  Oh, man.  Are they going to pay for it?  Oh, hopefully, right?  No.  I'm a broke guy.  I mean, I'm a rich guy stuck in a broke guy's body.  Do you think they'll just give me a lump sum of cash?  You know, they should.  They should.  I mean, I feel rich.  Why shouldn't I be able to be rich?  So true, Chris.  Yeah, there's really two issues here, Kimberly.  First of all, you got a guy playing girls' softball, which is wrong.  Right.  I don't care who it is.  Even though he thinks and feels like a girl.  Well, I think a guy playing girls' softball is wrong. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  They can hit the ball.  Of course they can.  Guys can hit the ball generally further than women.  Is that the dude?  I don't know.  Do we have any more of the picture down there?  Oh, that's it?  So is that a guy?  But they'll say no.  I think their argument is, well, no, it's not a boy.  You're not a boy who's becoming a girl.  This is who you are.  They're saying that there's a different gender.  I mean, again, I'm completely paraphrasing.  I could be fucking 100% wrong.  But that motherfucker jacked the ball further than fucking the chicks on the team. 
[00:53:30]  But, sorry.  Is that another picture of the dude?  But, I don't know.  Guys playing girls' sports.  That's, that's, why would you want to do that?  But they'll say he's not a guy.  Yeah.  And if you say he, they'll go, well, he's not a he.  He's not a she.  Obviously, there's no, you step in shit.  You're in a little circle.  Oh, wow.  Right.  And you step in shit no matter which direction you walk in.  What the fuck?  You verbally step in shit.  Yikes. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  I'm not going to say anything.  Wow.  You know, in my opinion, not very attractive.  You got a guy who wants to be a girl.  So then, because he wants to be a girl, he's playing on the girls' softball team.  Well, you can't.  Are we allowed to say that's strange?  That seems strange to me.  You can't not allow.  I remember being in high school.  We all remember being in high school, and that seems strange to me that you.  That was just a couple of years ago.  Thank you. 
[00:54:30]  That as a guy, you'd want to go on a girls' team.  But it's not a guy.  That's the whole thing.  But he's got guy parts still.  Doesn't matter.  Very confusing.  It is.  It is confusing.  The whole thing is very confusing.  But if you get.  All right.  If he says he's not a guy anymore, he thinks like a girl, but he has the guy parts, which  means he has the guy physique, like Rogan was talking about.  And now you're on a girls' team.  That's strange to me.  But if you say that it's strange to you. 
[00:55:00]  That seems like you would have an unfair advantage in general.  Although there are girls that could play the sport better than guys.  But in general, guys are stronger at sports.  I would imagine.  But you can't even say it's strange to me.  You can't even say it.  I know.  I know.  I know.  It's like, I can never get the LGBT.  You can't expect everyone just to understand this in the scope of a couple of years.  Yeah.  And don't mistake, like Jimmy said, don't mistake misunderstanding for hate.  Or even people who don't like it or people who don't get it. 
[00:55:30]  People who don't necessarily hate you.  No.  And there's a lot of people that don't want you to have your rights.  At least they were saying it on the radio so you know where they stand.  They weren't saying one thing and cowering and voting another way or going behind the scenes.  You know where they stand.  Right.  You can't get respect out of just fear.  No.  Fear mongering.  Making people scared to discuss the topic.  You're just going to get resentment.  You know, you get resentment.  People don't like being told what they can or cannot say with the consequences being their jobs. 
[00:56:00]  It takes time to get acceptance.  You can't force that on people because you just get people that are really just bitter that they're being forced to think a way, a certain way.  A few more years go by, then maybe this type of thing won't be as strange to the mainstream.  But the fact is, it's a bit strange when you really break it down and try to wrap your head around it.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean you hate the person because he's going through this in his life or her life. 
[00:56:30]  But that's it.  But it's just strange to me.  It's in all these organizations that are there for people of different sexuality, race, women's groups, all of it.  They take whatever the criticism is or the misunderstanding or whatever or other people's opinions.  And it instantly goes into the hate and bash and punch column.  You know, they can't see it as anything but hatred and you're not being tolerant. 
[00:57:00]  You know, it doesn't mean...  And you can have an opinion on this without it being hatred.  So there's the story in Rochester.  They cover the story and then they're trying to just have a little fun with it.  That's all this is.  They're doing dumb morning radio with it.  They're doing dumb morning radio trying to come up with some jokes.  They're failing miserably, to be completely honest with you.  But they're at least trying.  They're at least trying, though.  At least they're trying.  They're not like, yeah, fuck them.  You know, you should just go out and punch them in the face. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  That would be a firing offense.  Of course.  They're just trying to fucking entertain their listeners.  Not talking about how maybe the insurance company should deal with people with medical problems.  If they're going to deal with this, maybe they should take care of women that have been victims of cancer.  But you can't say a nut job.  A nut job.  Even if you're wrong, you can't say...  Like, how can that be a fireable offense?  Especially when you add, in my opinion.  It's a very vague term.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And nut job is very, you know, subjective. 
[00:58:00]  But to not be able to say that, even if people who are...  You're doomed.  Yeah, but transsexual will go, like, that's wrong.  I'm not a nut job.  Okay, fine.  But you can't fire someone for thinking that.  No.  Well, you can.  I guess so, yeah.  Any person or group that thinks this is a firing offense is an oversensitive douche.  Yeah.  Who's just trying to make some noise and get their group recognized.  Well, there's more audio, but so far...  Oh, maybe they'd go crazy there. 
[00:58:30]  But so far, I don't think they should have been fired for anything that I've heard.  Not even close.  And I don't like these guys at all.  I want to continue stressing that.  Yeah.  Because they took some ridiculously cheap shots at Brother Wee's who didn't deserve it.  He still has guy strength, right?  Right.  And I know this goes on in a number of sports.  If the school does not offer, like, boys' volleyball, there are boys who play on the girls'  volleyball team.  But clearly, in this situation, the school district does have baseball for boys. 
[00:59:00]  But does that mean this kid mentally thinks he's a woman or trying to become a woman, so he's going to play girls' softball?  Now, someone's trying to guess.  I will tell you, it is not a city school.  No.  Can't you just spitball like that?  It is not a city school.  Just talk about things and be like, just a flow of ideas and opinions and thoughts on a subject, and be able to do it unhindered.  It's amazing.  It's so...  It's unfortunate.  You should be able to...  I don't hear hate in their hearts about it. 
[00:59:30]  Hate, none.  I hear where they don't really understand the whole topic at hand.  Fucking ridiculous.  But even if you have hate in your heart, you probably should be able to do that on the radio.  You should be able to say it.  The old days used to be able to spew shit and have hate in your heart as long as you were following the FCC.  Right, right.  And their rules.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  You can't...  People should be able to listen to things and assess it in their own mind. 
[01:00:00]  And be able to interpret, if it's hate speech, if it's fucking just someone's opinion, if it's somebody with a lack of understanding, two people trying to figure something out.  You know?  When you just have a stream of consciousness and there's a genuine discussion about a topic going on on the air, you might hit on things that people might be offended by.  That you have completely wrong because it's an opinion based on something that you're not really that knowledgeable about.  But you shouldn't have to run everything through the, is this going to get me fired filter because some group is going to be upset that you're even discussing it. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  I hear nothing in this audio.  Nothing.  As far as, you know, being fired from.  I hear shitty radio.  Yeah.  It's just...  It's just bland.  It's just there.  It's not...  I don't even know if it's shitty.  It's just there.  I would be down the dial so fast.  I wouldn't even think twice about this discussion.  I would have moved on to some fucking music station for the song.  It was a spirit taurus.  We got a good amount of, a little bit of press from the, we talked about, what did we talk about? 
[01:01:00]  Right before we went on a break, about the liberal repression of speech.  Yes.  And it seems like that's been a big topic now, is how they're repressing speech.  And Bloomberg, it fits in with this, I will never bash Bloomberg again.  What?  Because he spoke at Harvard, and he just basically blasted Ivy League schools for being repressors of ideology.  And he pointed out how 96% of Ivy League schools donated to Obama, which is fine. 
[01:01:30]  But he's thinking that, that point of view is all that's being shown.  But let, I mean, that should give you a little perspective on the mindset there.  That 98%?  96.  96.  96, same fucking thing.  True.  Really, it's too different.  How his, uh, Raymond Kelly, his police commissioner was shouted down at Brown University when he was trying to talk about the policing in New York, and all that just screaming about his blacks and Muslims.  Like, they wouldn't even hear the discussion. 
[01:02:00]  Of course.  It's because the people getting angry.  Condoleezza Rice?  Yeah, Condoleezza Rice couldn't speak.  Couldn't speak.  Oh, they don't even want to hear somebody's, uh, take on, on life?  Little babies.  Little babies.  Little baby boys and baby girls.  Whammy and daddy have gone out of their way to never make them hear anything unpleasant.  Now can't even hear commencement speakers.  Right.  Please, I hope I got that word right.  With an opposing, with an opposing view of the 96%. 
[01:02:30]  It's just.  It's embarrassingly.  It is embarrassing.  One-sided and shallow.  But I'm glad people are calling them out now, and it's good to hear Bloomberg do that at Harvard.  Is the pendulum swinging back the other way?  It'll never swing back the other way.  But it's just nice to hear people, you know, just telling these language police.  He's going to go fuck themselves.  Let's get through this audio.  It is not a city school that has an alleged transgender kid on the girls' varsity softball team.  It shouldn't be allowed.  And tax dollars and medical insurance should not pay for that. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  If you want that, and that's going on in your head, that should be out of your own pocket.  Yeah.  That's why insurance companies are so screwed up.  They'll pay for that, but they don't want to pay for, you know, certain new therapies of cancer treatment.  That just blows my mind.  She's got that sexy, rasped voice.  It does good with girls on radio when they have that little rasp to their voice.  It sounds like they've been out smoking and drinking all night.  Yeah.  I like it.  She's not being outrageous there at all.  No.  Nothing outrageous about what she's saying.  She's usually used to complain about insurance companies.  Right, right. 
[01:03:30]  Like, hey, if you're going to do this, why not do that?  We've all had to deal with insurance companies where you get that letter and they're like,  yeah, we're not covering that.  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  You're not covering that.  Yeah.  Amazing.  I wanted my teeth cut into little baseball caps and they refused to do it.  They wouldn't do it?  No.  Aw.  But that'd be cute.  Baseball caps.  Yeah.  They don't, whatever.  Is there more?  Because I can't imagine that's what they got fired for.  Yeah, there's more.  And then a caller calls them out.  They drop some end bombs.  Something.  Caller calls them out, and that's, you know, that's part of when you're a spirit. 
[01:04:00]  Bowling, like Ann said, and throwing it around a little bit and trying to figure shit out  on the fly.  She's very opinionated about what's going on there in Rochester, and I don't hear anything,  you know, outrageous.  The PD says, then you take it to the phones.  Right, of course.  After you're done discussing, you take it to the next level.  Some kind of, what, is it a pyramid or something?  Something like that.  Who knows?  Ah-ha, you're on the radio with us.  Kimberly, I'm back.  What's up?  Oh, God.  God, that fucking voice.  You hear that?  Wow.  Wow.  That was a high. 
[01:04:30]  That was a...  Wow.  I love the radio.  I love the radio.  Oh, yuck.  God, we'll have a little...  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Ah-ha, let's hear him.  Now we're going to have to play this five times.  You know how this works.  Ah-ha, you're on the radio with us.  Kimberly, I'm back.  Oh, I am.  Come away, I'm black. 
[01:05:00]  Come away, I'm black.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  It's not even as bad as it is.  I know.  It never is.  Hi, you're on the radio with us.  Kimberly, I'm back.  What's up?  Oh, hi.  So you're speaking about this transgender individual in a very disrespectful manner.  Really, sir?  You know, you're missing a lot of points about being transgender.  The thing is, this girl, she's a girl.  She chose to be a girl.  You keep referring to her as a boy, and that's incredibly disrespectful. 
[01:05:30]  And it's...  Do you have a...  You chose...  The person's saying she chose to be a girl.  How do you expect everyone just to grasp that and accept it?  Right.  Not in God's eyes way, but that you choosing to be something is all of a sudden what it should be.  And how is discussing it disrespectful?  Like, that's not even...  What they did wasn't even disrespectful.  They're discussing some subject that... 
[01:06:00]  And it's no wacky opinion.  This is stuff that a lot of people think about this subject.  Of course.  How is it so disrespectful to say that it's a guy that's playing and not a woman?  In all fairness, that's the caller's opinion on that thing, which is fine.  Because now, okay, now have a discussion about it.  Maybe you'll learn from each other.  I don't know.  No, you've got to fire the people.  That's what you do.  That's incredibly disrespectful. 
[01:06:30]  Wasn't she born a boy?  You're talking about the high school player on the varsity girls softball team, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here in the area.  We didn't mention what school.  Uh-huh.  So, she is still a boy, right?  Oh, she is still a boy, right?  Oh, she is still a boy, right?  But this is how people think about it.  Jimmy Stewart.  That's a little Jimmy Stewart in there.  We're going to throw this. 
[01:07:00]  Keep your chin up.  Now, I just want to make fun of their voices.  I don't even give a fuck anymore.  I don't know.  Whatever they're saying, it's just blah, blah, blah, at this point.  Right, right.  Now, I'm just picking up on the bad radio voices.  We didn't mention what school.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, she is still a boy, right?  So, she is still a boy, right?  Right?  What is that?  Is that the same guy as...  That isn't even a voice. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, shit.  So, uh, she is still a boy, right?  Right.  So, she is a boy, right?  And, uh, well...  Well, you hear Jimmy Stewart, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, I got to hear it one more time.  Sorry, people.  Cool.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, she is still a boy, right?  Right?  Yeah.  You got to get your toolbar. 
[01:08:00]  Toolbar.  Look at your toolbar.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this.  You got to play that at the break.  Keep your chin up.  I love that.  Don't get through this.  True or less?  No.  She has a penis, but she's still female.  That's how it works.  But she has a testosterone.  Wait, did you guys hear that?  And I just think...  Oh, Jimmy's inner voice?  Yes, my inner monologue.  But that's going to...  What that guy on the phone said, and believes in his heart... 
[01:08:30]  In his soul...  Yes.  Other people, most of us, still can't wrap our heads around.  Period.  If you have a penis and testicles...  Right.  ...you're considered a male.  Right.  In just about every aspect of life.  But people are trying to explain to us that's not the case.  That's not the case.  Because their brains are wired differently.  I understand where they're coming from, but for us to completely understand that, it's going to take a lot longer. 
[01:09:00]  Physically, it's a dude playing softball.  Right.  Physically, come on.  Yeah, there's no third set of genitals.  No.  Uh-huh.  There's no third set of genitals.  There's the reproductive organs of a man, and there's the reproductive organs of a woman.  Yeah.  So the point is, it's like if there was a third set of genitals, people would go, like, oh, okay.  Right.  So how do you expect people just to understand that because you say it?  I'm not saying it's not even that they're lying, but how do you expect people just to grab that and go, oh, okay, that's the way... 
[01:09:30]  You're right.  Right.  Yeah.  You've got three different things that you're trying to force into two categories.  And still...  You know what I mean?  Like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's penises, vaginas, and then there's people that, you know...  But there's only a penis and vagina.  Right.  As far as what dictates a man and a woman.  Right.  That's it.  Period.  Period.  What do they say that, like, you're not defined by your genitals?  I mean, again...  Oh, stop.  I don't... 
[01:10:00]  Scientifically, yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  You should see me walk around in sweatpants.  I have.  Trust me.  I still can't figure it out.  Trust me.  I'm like, that guy's got a big cliff.  And again, so far...  I have a small penis, you son of a bitch.  So far, nothing.  Fireable.  No, nothing.  And I've got to say it again.  I do not like these guys whatsoever.  Oh, see, I thought you liked them.  Whatsoever.  It's my favorite radio show.  So this pains me.  Yeah.  Because the easy thing to do would be, fuck these guys, because, you know, they fucked with 
[01:10:30]  the, you know, my mentor, basically.  But as a broadcaster.  But as a broadcaster, I see nothing in this that should get these guys fired.  Yeah.  But she has a testosterone, which makes her stronger than the average bear.  Okay.  But there's some females out there who have a lot of testosterone naturally.  But they're females.  They're born females.  They're still female.  The ability...  Well, see, having a vagina does not make you a better softball player. 
[01:11:00]  No.  But having a penis...  It certainly can be used as a backup glove, can't it?  It's funny.  That's funny.  It's funny.  Catching a softball with your cunt.  Yeah, that was a fucking funny line.  There you go.  You squat on a ground ball, takes a bad hop.  Absolutely.  You pick it up, you go run over and drop it on the bag.  Looks like the alien birth.  Fucking slimy softball that nobody wants to touch.  I liked it. 
[01:11:30]  Looks like a candy-coated apple.  Clots on it.  Going for the joke?  Yeah.  No hate behind that joke.  Just trying to get, you know, trying to be a little silly.  Pussy catcher's joke.  Um, the thing about being transgender, though, is this kind of, no, it's this kind of spread  of misinformation that keeps the stigma alive.  Listen, here's the thing.  What you want to do with your body and what sex you want to be is your business.  And we embrace it.  I've got no problem with that.  Kimberly's got no problem with that. 
[01:12:00]  I don't.  We just don't think the city of Rochester taxpayers should, should be on the hook for that.  That's all.  Nor do I think if you're transgender, should you get to, if you're a boy, who in your mind  you're a girl, and maybe you've gone through the process, you shouldn't be able to play  on the girls' varsity.  You have advantages.  You have strength advantages.  You have hormone advantages.  You should be playing on the boys' baseball team.  But do you see right there when, I'm sorry, when they said, uh...  They embrace the sexuality of the individuals. 
[01:12:30]  So, there you go.  Wow.  And the person said...  There you go.  She said, she said, uh, you're, you're spreading misinformation.  No.  They're not coming off like an authority on the subject.  Not at all.  Not at all.  The Surgeon General or the...  They are just talking it through.  They're having a discussion.  They're having a discussion.  And everyone says that's, you know, what we need to do.  We need to have an open dialogue about this.  Oh, God, right.  What a bunch of fucking liars.  Right.  Open dialogue, my fucking ass.  They put that caller through.  They didn't shout down that caller.  They listened to that caller.  We're, we're safer than most here at Satellite Radio, but even us, 
[01:13:00]  playing this audio and discussing it, in the back of my head,  I'm, like, being extremely fucking careful.  Oh, what do we say?  Right.  Extremely fucking careful.  These guys, I don't know if I've told you, but I really hate their fucking guts.  You have not made that clear.  See, I thought...  I hate their fucking guts.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  They have done...  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  And then it just turns into...  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[01:13:30]  Fucking Herman Munster in a wig.  Lily, how you doing?  Grandpa?  Grandpa, Eddie, how you doing?  That's a big bitch.  Oh, yeah.  Holy...  She would kick my ass.  Has ya?  I'm pretty convinced that she would probably win in a fight with me.  Fucking probably?  And I do all right.  Definitely.  I'm just going to say I do all right.  You can scrap?  I can scrap a little, but I think she would get the best.  She'd get the best, yeah, in the long run. 
[01:14:00]  How would she do it, you think?  Fucking pin you down.  Really?  Choke you out.  She would choke you.  Yeah.  She would guillotine choke you.  Choke you.  Guillotine choke.  But at least I would have those...  Oh, fuck.  At least I would have those warm boobs resting on the back of my head as she chokes me out.  Yeah, you'd be looking at her heels as she fucking...  It's like a standing guillotine.  She would lift you up and your little dumb feet would come off the ground.  Just imagine that tunnel vision just closing in on her heels.  Yeah.  As you fucking lose consciousness. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, and you're feeling the sweat of her side through her shirt because she's in combat mode.  Is that okay to say that a big bitch would beat me up?  Hearing how you're doing.  How you're doing.  Echoing.  Because your hearing is going.  How you're doing now.  Or she'd be taunting you.  You're not doing so well.  Yeah, yeah.  How you're doing.  A guillotine choke.  Yeah.  That's how it would go down?  Yeah, or she'd throw you on the ground and fucking side-mound you and pound you with her fucking elbow.  She would give you a brutal, like a male beatdown.  Oh, yeah.  Here's another question because, you know, as a guy, you're taught not to hit women. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  When do you start just fucking hammer-fisting her?  If you're losing, right?  Because you're losing.  Right?  You're losing.  When do you go, fuck everything I know about not hitting women?  Start fighting like a man.  And start fighting.  Yeah.  When?  Once you pop shit a few times with some jabs?  Maybe a heel to the balls?  What would it take for you to go, I'm done.  I now have to hit a woman.  I think as a guy, you have to take a defensive stance with a woman and just try to protect yourself. 
[01:15:30]  Sure.  But if they start getting the best of you and you feel that your consciousness might be slipping away, you've just got to haul off.  But what is that?  Like one good, solid punch they get into your head?  Yeah.  And you get a little, like, woozy?  You start losing your legs and you see that they're charging at you?  Next thing you know, you're on the ground just hammer-fisting a brawl.  Just a brutal fucking movie beatdown.  I always wonder that.  Yeah.  When do you have to cross the line?  Yeah, chivalry goes out the window. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  Is she suffocating you with her big ass?  Anyway, let's continue with this audio.  But yeah, they say to have the discussion.  They are having the discussion.  They're not saying beat up transgendered people or they're garbage or fuck them or get them out of the car.  They're having, they're talking through honest feelings.  Yes.  They're not experts.  So spreading misinformation is done by experts.  They're not experts.  No one thinks that these two morons are fucking medical experts. 
[01:16:30]  I like that they're having this discussion because you might learn something.  You know, what ends up happening in the end, you've got other radio shows that see that these radio shows are getting fired.  So now these tougher topics, they're not even, they're not even going to even touch.  Yeah.  And you can, you can get some knowledge by just discussing things.  They don't want an open discussion.  City taxpayers do pay for school sports teams because it's school tax, right?  Right.  Nobody pays for a transgender person's stuff, treatment and care and all that. 
[01:17:00]  It does come out of pocket.  Well, they're only paying so much of it.  If you work for the city of Rochester, the city's insurance is now going to pay for it.  Oh, cool.  I mean, that was the point of our conversation.  I don't see what that has to do with this high school kid, though.  Well, I mean, it was just someone had texted in saying, hey, did you know, in the midst of our talking about the city of Rochester insurance,  now paying for transgendered individuals?  It was just kind of a conversation within a conversation. 
[01:17:30]  Okay.  Got it?  Still, it's incredibly disrespectful towards transgender people.  Please don't spread any misinformation.  But do you see right there how, like, they gave her a reasonable answer about how this happened.  Wow, a completely reasonable answer.  And still keep the narrative.  Please don't spread misinformation.  Right.  They're not authorities on the subject.  They're not professing to be either.  They're just giving an opinion.  Just talking.  Jack and Jack.  Please don't spread any misinformation, especially when you're joking about it.  Okay, thank you, sir.  Now, why you got to be mean like that? 
[01:18:00]  That was funny.  Just thank you, sir.  But was that a guy or a girl on the phone?  I don't know, but that was funny.  Thank you, sir.  There's nothing here.  Oh, and I despise these people.  Let me, we have one more clip, but let me go to Mark in Rochester.  Marky.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Mark.  How are you going?  Here's the funny thing.  I mean, did you guys kind of hit the nail on the head? 
[01:18:30]  Of course we did.  How?  You're bringing the discussion up.  I mean, you should be able to talk about it.  And the fact that they're joking about it, that's what they do.  They're DJs.  I was only joking.  What the thing is, when they said Nut Job, I think that really hit a chord, and that kind  of put it over the edge.  But again, if you look at a new release, I think even last week on a DVD, there's a Disney  movie that came out called Nut Job, and it's a cartoon.  Right.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's just, it's ridiculous.  I mean, like I said, you have to have an open phone. 
[01:19:00]  But someone's got a problem with that.  It's, you know, but anyway, I'm punching out, guys.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That caller got their points out, and they were allowed to talk, and they weren't shouted  down.  You know, the guy said, you know, thank you for calling, sir.  You couldn't really tell on the phone if there was a Merrill.  Yeah.  I think the articles I read, they got fired for saying Nut Job.  Oh, was it?  Okay.  Really?  More or less, that part of it.  But here's one more piece of audio from the whole thing.  This guy who's playing girls' softball, does he use the girls' locker room? 
[01:19:30]  That's up to the individual.  Why?  Some states actually have laws that prevent transgender people from choosing their own  bathroom.  I've got to figure that he probably doesn't.  Although, I bet you if you ask the girls at this high school that's not in the city, but  it's in one of the suburbs, I bet you ask the girls, they probably don't care one way  or the other.  I mean, they're not worried about this kid, probably, who's transgendered, using the girls'  locker room.  When he steps up to the plate, doesn't he have two bats?  He's making pussy jokes, dick jokes. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, thank you, sir.  Right.  It's fucking funny.  Yeah.  Right?  Not bad.  Okay.  But listen.  Making jokes.  Another thing about being transgender is...  She doesn't want to joke with you about it, but you understand.  We really...  We understand all the nuances of the sensitivity, and we get it.  I just don't...  I think if you're born with a penis, you should remain...  Yeah, you're a boy, and you should remain on the boys' team until you no longer have the 
[01:20:30]  penis, but that, again, that's just me.  I may be narrow-minded in this.  So, I mean, here's the deal, though.  Again, I'm just going to say it.  There are...  See, these guys, they're pretty smart broadcasters because they know all the...  the problem areas, because they keep saying, that's my opinion.  Yeah, you can hear.  They're actually trying.  That used to be good enough in radio.  Yeah.  Yep.  You know?  But they found something to get them on.  Now, Ope likes these guys, right?  Yeah, I mean, you're defending them because you're a fan of the show. 
[01:21:00]  A fan of the show.  But I'm being impartial in defending them.  I will fucking flip shit right now.  Oh, shit.  You don't have to love these guys.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Fucking...  Was it Fred from Brooklyn?  Wait.  He has a funny tweet about my fight with my imaginary...  Fred from Brooklyn.  Fred Brooklyn on Twitter.  He writes, she beat you with a garbage can cover like Sonny and the Godfather.  Bite your hand if you try to grab onto the railing. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  You make fun of my how you doing again, and I'll kill you.  I would know she means business when she rips off her fucking wig and goes into fighting  stance.  Oh, yeah.  Fight mode.  And then I'm like, ah, shit.  I'm in trouble.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Does she take her heels off before she starts kicking the shit out of me?  Yes.  She does?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'd rather have the heels on because she'd be a little off balance.  Yeah, you might get an advantage there. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Right.  Chop out the base.  Oh, God.  You've never been beat up by a girl, right?  Not for free.  No.  I don't know.  Were you in court for my divorce?  Oh, for the sound thrashing.  That's going to suck.  All right.  Let's get to the end of this.  We're just about there.  Gary.  There shouldn't be, you know, a boy who thinks he's a girl. 
[01:22:30]  On the girls' varsity softball team.  I don't care if he's going through all the transgendered stuff.  Yeah.  I get it.  We're sensitive to that.  You can do whatever you want to do with your body.  Love whoever you want to love.  We have always said on this show, not enough love in the world.  No.  The fact of the matter is, the city shouldn't pay with taxpayer dollars, insurance, for transgendered stuff.  Just like if you feel like, man, I'd really like a facelift because of my nose too big.  Or maybe I've got wrinkles.  Oh, I'm really, I'm a nut about it.  Right.  I mean, where do you draw the line?  A dude looks like a lady. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, I get it.  A dude looks like a lady.  Aerosmith made a lot of money off making fun of the fact.  Yeah, they're making fun of Aerosmith, though.  Dude looks like a lady.  You probably couldn't put that song out nowadays.  What was that about?  Was that about?  It has to be.  It was about a dude that looks like a lady, right?  Uh, if I know my rock and roll knowledge, I think it's about Motley Crue, actually.  Really?  I think they were kind of making fun of the fact that they kind of had the makeup.  Get the fuck out of here.  I think.  Someone might, uh, maybe someone could help me on that one. 
[01:23:30]  I believe so.  I'm just going through all the words in my head.  Dude looks like a lady.  In fact, we're here in the time.  Of our lives.  Somebody say, forgive me if I see my little life.  Does anyone know?  I feel like I read that somewhere.  Wikipedia is saying that it's, uh, interpreted as about being about a drag queen.  Oh.  Okay.  Drag queen's not, uh, good.  You can't say that.  You can't say tranny.  You can't say she-male.  Why can't you say drag queen?  I don't know. 
[01:24:00]  I've never heard that be.  Because you're pointing out that someone might look different than you.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to do that nowadays.  That was another thing that I think, uh, RuPaul was commenting about, that people were  mad because he, she, whatever, used, uh, she-male.  Right.  Uh, as the, you know, viewer-male thing for the TV show.  Yeah.  She-male.  Let's, let's check out the, uh, she-male.  And then it's like, oh, that's terrible.  Oh, you can't use that.  Derogatory.  Oh.  How the fuck do you keep track of what's derogatory now? 
[01:24:30]  Things that were acceptable forever.  Like, all of a sudden, overnight, it's a bad word now, and you can't use it, and it's  hatred.  Shut up.  And Ru said that it's not the words, it's the intent and where it's coming from.  Yeah.  And if you're a member of that community, and you think RuPaul, who has been, who  literally has, it became mainstream, and people are like, oh, I kind of like RuPaul.  I like that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And now all of a sudden, you're turning on RuPaul because Ru doesn't use the appropriate  words.  Go fuck yourselves.  They probably look at Ru like a, a, a tranny Uncle Tom. 
[01:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Oh, you're just, oh.  But RuPaul put transvestites on the map.  Entercom statement on the whole thing.  Oh, thank God.  I'm sure it's not groveling around.  Thank God.  I bet diversity, tolerance, words like that.  So, I really come from a place where I don't like these guys.  And, uh...  What guys?  I kind of...  The radio show?  But I don't like them.  Well, you guys. 
[01:25:30]  Why?  That's very hurtful.  I come from a place.  But with that said, I, I almost feel sorry for these, these, these guys.  They got fucked royally.  They did.  They were having an open discussion about something that's going on in their town.  A lot of people probably think the same way.  They said that, uh, you should be able to love whoever you want.  And, and, and, you know, they, they understand the topic in general.  Yeah.  And then they had people that had, uh, you know, other opinions.  And they, and they discussed it with them. 
[01:26:00]  Discussed it openly.  Openly.  Like everyone says you're supposed to.  Yep.  We need to open a dialogue on race.  We need a dialogue on the transgendered community.  We gotta talk openly about misogyny and women and that, it's all bullshit.  You don't want an open discussion.  You think an open discussion is, uh, your point of view, no dissenting point of view.  Right.  And that's open discussion.  And radio is weird because people don't want to acknowledge that maybe broadcasters are 
[01:26:30]  just trying to make jokes as well.  Yeah.  They, they know it was a joke, but then they take it out of context.  And then they, and then in writing, it looks like, oh my God, do you hear this hateful thing?  They said.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They know you're kidding.  They don't care.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  But why radio guys?  Why are we the lowest scum in entertainment?  We certainly are.  Intercom statements, uh, statement from Intercom Rochester's vice president and general manager, 
[01:27:00]  Sue Munn, reads as follows.  This morning, Intercom fired Kimberly and Beck effective immediately.  Ah, I don't know why they always have to add that.  Effective immediately.  When you're fired, you get to linger a little bit.  Effective 10 years from now.  When you're fired, you're fired.  Why the effective immediately?  It sounds like you're doing what, effective we'll see when.  Right. 
[01:27:30]  They're hateful.  Hateful.  That's why I fucking hate radio.  That's why I fucking hate radio.  Cowards, don't hate.  You can't even stick up for your own people.  Because there's nothing in there that was actually hateful.  Nothing.  Just because you're a fan of the show, don't.  That's why we're very biased.  View of this on.  I hate them for other reasons, but.  Oh.  But they didn't say anything hateful in there.  There was nothing hateful.  Their hateful comments against the transgender community do not represent our station or our company. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, shut up.  Wow.  We deeply, we deeply apologize.  Apologies are so deep.  You could just apologize.  You don't have to go very deep.  We deeply apologize to the transgender community, the community of Rochester, and anyone else  who was offended by their hateful comments.  Community.  Their hateful comments.  They're calling what we listen to hateful comments in this day and age.  I don't trust.  Unbelievable.  I don't trust one fucker in management. 
[01:28:30]  Nope.  They will throw you under the bus in a second.  That's terrible.  They know damn well there's nothing hateful in there.  Not a thing.  And they don't have the balls to say that.  Not a thing.  They don't have the balls to say, you know, they took on a tough topic this morning.  Their opinions are their opinions.  I think they made it clear that's how they feel.  But they also said in there that there's not enough love in the world and you should be able to love whoever you want.  They should have gotten a pat on the back.  Like, Jesus, what about all that stuff?  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  And I fucking hate these fucking guys.  Oh, see, but.  We are proud of our past work on behalf.  Look at this.  We are proud of our past work on behalf of the local LGBT community.  What do they do for the community?  I would love to know exactly what they did.  And we remain committed to that partnership.  This gross lawyer pussy language.  Partnership.  Partnership.  And then Kimberly and Beck apologize, I guess.  Let's see.  Or is this the story about the apology? 
[01:29:30]  Waddle-dee-doodle.  Oh, okay.  Intercom Rock.  The Buzz.  We might have been on The Buzz up there for a while.  I don't even know.  New York Fire Morning Duo.  Kimberly and Beck following an on-air on-air remarks over new transgender benefits for a city of Rochester employees caused an uproar.  They're hateful, hateful remarks.  It didn't cause an uproar.  No.  There was a letter that was sent to the station.  Yeah.  A form letter, basically.  One letter, right? 
[01:30:00]  That's what I think.  Yeah.  We are very sorry for the hurt and pain we have caused to anyone, especially those in the transgender community and their friends and families.  What we said and the manner in which we handled ourselves was wrong.  This is Kimberly and Beck apologizing.  Wrong?  What was wrong about that?  At this point, they were trying to save their asses.  Good lack.  Because apologies are all bullshit.  We know that.  What we said and the manner in which we handled ourselves was wrong.  We take full responsibility and we deeply apologize to any.  Deeply. 
[01:30:30]  And all that.  We offended.  Put on your scuba gear.  We're going deep.  They don't believe any of this stuff.  Of course they don't.  This is Kimberly and Beck's apology.  Our attempt was to discuss a controversial health care issue.  However, our lack of sensitivity and understanding of the transgender people and their plight created 12 minutes of radio.  We, that wish we could take back.  That's how that reads.  We wish that we could take back.  We fully understand Intercom's position and their decision to dismiss us.  They're trying to like. 
[01:31:00]  This is all about.  Setting up pay.  This is all about severance package.  And setting up for their next day.  Right.  It is their right and we accept their decision and our responsibility in it.  It's too bad they have to say that.  Yeah.  They don't believe any of this shit.  I truly love Big Brother.  Intercom has been and will continue to be a strong advocate for the LGBT community.  And we are proud to have been helpful in Intercom's efforts over our 13 years with the company.  This is groveled.  They fired a radio show that was with them for 13 years over. 
[01:31:30]  Over that.  Over what we just heard.  Over what you just heard.  And the lawyer.  And then the lawyer writes that statement up.  Over what we just heard.  The lawyer writes that statement up and that should be their.  That's their statement.  Zero sincerity.  13 years.  And they might have had.  I don't even think.  But they might have had a bad segment in there that some people were offended by.  Might have.  Might have.  It is our hope that this situation can be a time of learning and understanding about the  trends of the community.  And not a time for additional anger and insensitivity. 
[01:32:00]  This is a community of individuals who struggle painfully to be themselves and find the support  and comfort they deserve.  We believe that this can be a chance for all of us to stop the ignorance and find our humanity.  Signed, Kimberly Ray and Barry Beck.  Written by LGBT community and some shitty lawyer from Intercom.  Yes.  Lunch of lawyers got together.  There's not one ounce of true humanity in that.  No sincerity. 
[01:32:30]  It's lawyer blanket cover talk.  It's just shit.  Learn.  Let's learn.  Let's learn together.  We're happy we got fired.  Yes.  Because we can help.  That's pretty much it.  We're happy we got fired because now we can understand and learn.  Right.  It's a stupid radio show.  We all do.  We all just do stupid radio shows in the end.  I don't want to learn anything of substance doing this.  No.  Are you kidding?  Why would I want to?  We're not teaching.  Right.  We're not here to teach you anything.  We get shit wrong every day. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  And I go home and I don't even think about it.  Don't even care.  I don't care what I got wrong.  Oh, they'll tell me on Twitter.  But I don't even care when I read the tweets.  I don't care.  Doesn't even matter.  Who cares, right?  Some days I get a couple good jokes in and other days I bomb horribly.  I don't give a fuck.  It doesn't matter.  We just come in here and try to fool around a little bit.  Oh, God.  Try to fool around a little bit.  With each other.  That's right, Jimmy.  That's right.  That's right.  Bunch of men doing some shoulder kissing. 
[01:33:30]  You hateful man.  Wow.  That's a rough one, boys and girls.  That's a big radio company that doesn't even stick by their people.  Knowing that, you know, when you turn on these mics every morning, you know, it's...  Especially when you're...  There's a minefield out there.  Landmines all over the place and you never know.  Because you don't...  That's the beauty of a landmine.  You don't even know what is going to fucking blow up your ass.  No.  You don't know which one.  You don't know which step is going to do that. 
[01:34:00]  I couldn't enter...  Which direction?  And go like, we don't agree with what the host said.  They don't reflect the company's views.  They're individuals.  And then behind the scenes say, like, look, guys, just be careful with this one.  Like, why not just...  Why couldn't it be something casual like that?  It's got to be a firing and an instant garbage lawyer statement.  God, and they...  I would sue.  I swear to you, if I was them...  Sue everyone.  I would sue.  They want their back, their money.  Yeah, but I would sue.  Fuck it.  Because they said hateful a few times in their apology statement. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  There was no hate in that.  No.  Prove they had hate in their hearts when they did that break.  Prove it.  Prove it in a court of law.  I would love to see that case.  No one would think that that was a hate speech.  You know?  They didn't completely understand the mind of a transgender individual.  Right.  That's okay.  What did they do wrong there?  And we all know insurance companies are shitty.  So when you do hear that they're, you know, going to cover something like that, you think 
[01:35:00]  of all the stuff in your own life they didn't cover.  Right.  And that does make you go, what the fuck?  It does.  The best thing you can do is what they did, is have an open discussion about all this stuff.  But people are now petrified to even discuss some of these topics.  Not even get controversial with the subject matter.  But even discuss matters of race or sexuality. 
[01:35:30]  People are petrified.  They don't want to do it.  Yeah.  That's the forward-thinking, progressive, liberal way we deal with things now, is to not even  talk about, to be afraid to progress and to talk openly about subjects.  Right.  That is exactly what Jimmy brought up before vacation.  And you're considered conservative to say that.  I'm not conservative.  Yeah.  I'm really not. 
[01:36:00]  But you're considered a conservative if you feel that way?  It's just astounding how stupid people are.  I mean, I'm probably getting, you know, I'm just saying I'm not conservative.  Oh, right.  I'm not conservative.  Jesus.  Breaking news.  What?  I'm not conservative.  Of course I am.  I'm probably open-minded.  Right.  Open-minded.  Almost breaking news.  Can we have a stinger?  Almost breaking news.  Almost.  Almost breaking news.  Wouldn't even make the message boards.  Yeah, so, fuck. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Well.  That bothers me.  Bon voyage.  I went into this, I didn't want to hear the audio until we, I like hearing this stuff,  you know, fresh.  I read all the articles and I was all like, yeah, fuck those guys.  Why?  They did my boy wheeze wrong, so fuck those guys.  I can't wait to hear the audio.  And then I thought.  And then I hear it, I'm like, you gotta defend them.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  As broadcasters, you have to.  That's why all those, those black, um, um, morning radio hosts were all fucking stupid 
[01:37:00]  and dumb to do the rah-rah when I just got fired.  Yeah.  Because they're coming after you next, you stupid fucks.  Yeah.  You know.  Sometimes you gotta defend someone that you don't, you know, you don't, you know, like  or agree with.  Although it is kind of like a rock, paper, scissor thing with, um, different, uh, races  and stuff.  Like if, if, if black people talk about race on the air, you could pretty much get away  with murder.  Um, but, uh, gay issues, you can't, you know. 
[01:37:30]  Asian issues.  Yeah.  Black hosts can't get away with.  Right.  White people.  They, you could, they could, black shows could bring a white person on and say, it's kick  whitey Tuesdays and white people would, would, would be upset, like afraid to, to call it  out because they don't want to be considered a racist.  Right.  Oh, wow.  That one doesn't sit well at all.  No.  That was pretty, uh, pretty instant radio right there.  Believe it or not.  On a tough topic.  Obviously a tough topic that most of us completely don't. 
[01:38:00]  We just can't wrap our heads around it.  Yeah.  We just can't.  It's very confusing when you try to really figure it all out.  Exactly.  And I, I don't like the guy thing where the guy, the guys that go into like girl shit.  Yeah.  Like the Hooters.  I was thinking of Hooters.  When guys are like, I'm going to be a Hooters waitress.  Yeah.  And then he sues Hooters for his right to be.  I should be able to.  A waiter at Hooters.  Shut up.  I hate all that stuff. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, puppy.  Uh, a, a pawfect pair?  A pawfect pair.  It doesn't make any sense.  All right.  I guess.  Is there, uh, uh, one of the Fox News concerts going on out there now?  Charlie Daniels.  Charlie Daniels is out there, huh?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  Is he going to do The Devil Went Down to Georgia?  He was looking for a soul to steal.  He was way behind.  I used to know every word of that song.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  He was way behind.  He was looking to make a deal. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  I used to know every fucking word of that song.  I came across this young man.  He was selling a fiddle and playing a hot.  Play a fiddle of gold against your soul.  I don't think I'm better than you.  No, The Devil jumped up on a hickory stump.  Oh.  He said, boy, let me tell you what.  Tell you what.  I guess you didn't know it.  I'm a fiddle player, too.  I'm a fiddle player, too.  And if you can't take it there, I'll make a bet with you.  He said, you play a good fiddle, Chip.  Chip beat Daniels.  Down to Georgia for a soul to steal. 
[01:39:30]  That's the white man, right?  Went down to Georgia.  Is that what he means?  It was hate speech.  I'm sorry.  I deeply apologized.  He said, boy, let me tell you what.  You didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.  And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.  This song was huge.  You play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due.  I'm a gold against your story, because I think I'm better than you.  Let's see what he's playing.  Let's see what he's playing.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:40:00]  You play devil.  Yeah, the house next door to me was sold.  He's got that, what is it called, the pubis?  The pubis?  Pussy region.  I don't know.  What is it called again?  The fuba.  Wow.  This song ain't devilin' down to Georgia.  What? 
[01:40:30]  I follow Charlie on Twitter.  Is he a conservative?  Oh, boy.  He is very conservative, very religious, and, yeah, very pro-America kind of a thing.  How old is Charlie?  He's got to be in his 70s at this point.  Let me look it up real fast here.  This is 77 years old.  This is a rarity.  Usually they just show them quick and go, oh, never mind.  Oh, there we go. 
[01:41:00]  Yes, yes.  Charlie Daniels.  What's this about rarities?  First concert I ever saw.  Long Island Arena.  Charlie Daniels?  Charlie Daniels.  Yeah.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  What happened?  It's made of face of Iraq.  Oh.  I said it was sexy.  Yeah.  He said rarity.  I like it.  So why don't we take a break?  We're going to do some other things.  The yearbook photoshopping.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  And other apologies?  By the way, we still haven't gone 10 days.  We haven't gone two days. 
[01:41:30]  Without an apology.  We were gone, I mean, with the weekend involved, what, about eight days, something like that?  And there were apologies all over the place when we were away from radio for a week.  We can't go a week.  We can't go a week.  I just want to reiterate, here on the Opie and Anthony Show, we're trying to go 10 lousy  days without some kind of, you know, apology.  Yeah.  And we can't do it.  No.  It's becoming a joke in this country.  It's becoming ridiculous.  Oh, I've got to hit the bathroom again.  It's crazy. 
[01:42:00]  I went to the London.  Don't tell I stayed there in Los Angeles.  Boy, it must have been a long flight there and back.  The restaurant in there is fucking sick.  That's the one I went, and Donnie got us in the kitchen for the special chef table.  Ah, Dandy Dunn-Wicklin?  And I made fun of the whole thing, and to this day, he's bummed out.  What's his name?  From the chef's show?  Yeah, yeah.  It's his restaurant.  Ramsey.  Jordan Ramsey.  No.  Food there is amazing. 
[01:42:30]  Jordan Ramsey.  It's fucking crazy.  I don't like Gordon Ramsey stuff.  No.  But it got you Gordwig?  Yeah, it's got...  Well, I was like...  Got a little gurgle going on?  I've been just shitting all morning.  You're a real spokesman for the restaurant.  It's crazy.  Look, I'm not trying to be.  I'm not the espresso.  Are you dropping hammers, or are they...  What's the consistency?  This is dropping spackle.  Yeah.  It's pudding with tumors in it.  Really?  I'm dropping fucking wallpaper glue.  Oh, no hammers to be seen. 
[01:43:00]  No, it's like what comes out of a glue gun.  Yes.  It's white.  It's cum.  It's cum.  It shouldn't cum.  Someone came in my ass.  Apparently, that's what Jimmy's implying.  Can I isolate that?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Save that, please.  Save the cum in my ass.  Well, by the way, thank you, Psycho Bob.  One more call on this topic, because this is very important.  It really is.  Psycho Bob, go ahead.  Very good point.  Good morning, boys. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, hello.  The question is, does this mean that taking care of transgender surgery is more important  than taking care of our veterans?  Yeah, apparently.  Well, that's sort of the point they were making up there.  Like, wow, you're covering that, but you're not covering all these other things.  And then you've got veterans dying because they're told to wait.  Yeah, they're not getting proper coverage.  And they're talking about Chelsea Manning, whose name was originally Bradley Manning.  I don't know if he got the surgery or whatever, but how does he get that kind of care? 
[01:44:00]  And regular veterans are not getting, or other veterans are not getting...  That's why you should discuss it.  It confuses people that you're now covering that, but you're not covering some of these  other things.  They got fired for that.  Wow.  That's, that's, oof.  Wow.  Crazy.  That's ridiculous.  Yep.  Okay, we got other things.  Right.  Oh, I get it.  Can't do this song these days.  Oh, right. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Wait, can we stop the song?  Why would the champagne taste like Coca-Cola?  Coca-Cola.  Just so we could get to Lola?  C-O-L-A cola.  You got to get to Lola somehow, right?  He's just trying to get to Lola, right?  I think he's just trying to get to Lola.  And one of the lines is, lips like cherry cola.  Lips like cherry cola.  So he uses it again to get to Lola? 
[01:45:00]  He really wanted to sing about Lola.  What else rhymes with Lola?  But what a...  Ebola.  Ebola.  Ebola.  But what a weird way to get to Lola.  Yeah.  You're sipping champagne that tastes just like Coca-Cola?  Yeah.  I've had champagne.  Have you ever had champagne that tastes anything like Coca-Cola?  None.  So what is he getting at there?  It rhymes with Lola.  That's all it is, huh?  What else, right?  There's not really...  Rain or me. 
[01:45:30]  Or me.  Rain or me.  All day yesterday.  All day.  Rain or me.  All day long.  And then you get the Twitter assholes.  You know, for most of the song, Roger actually does say or.  What?  Oh, jeez, I fucked the whole thing up.  On, on, on.  No, he doesn't.  The Twitter fucking asshole said it.  He never says rain on me.  Because half the time he is singing rain on me.  That person should jump out a window because he's saying rain or me the entire song. 
[01:46:00]  Rain or me.  Of course, it's rain over me.  Right.  It's to rain over me.  But then you could say rain on me.  No, not really.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Holy love.  This person's an asshole.  Can't make it rain.  This is like TBT.  I always hated this.  Throwback.  I always hated the brrrr of the drums. 
[01:46:30]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  I like it in the shining.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Very scary.  And then the tinkling.  Tinkling of the keys.  I, I absolutely love this song, but not the beginning so much.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  I like when it starts that.  This is just showing off.  No, I still don't like it.  I like, I like when it goes.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  This is where the song should start.  Okay.  right here oh yeah this is ripoff by the way 
[01:47:00]  i saw the who at giant stadium yeah and they were doing like uh tommy yeah  fucking crazy i love that tommy it's quirky and strange  it was huge too the sound they had horns and everything 
[01:47:30]  oh what's what what ray  it's not on  then they would have called it rain on me  they would have solved a lot of problems by just saying  rain on me and a lot of times if you imagine something being said that's what  you hear  so if you hear it as rain on me you're gonna hear it as rain on me and doesn't  song work if it's just rain on me it's gonna be it's kind of nice to be 
[01:48:00]  rained on  no but it's raining over him  i know  it's raining over me it's raining over me  but how about how about the fact that it's not r-a-i-n  it's rain  right like to rain over something but don't they have like some a king doesn't  rain on you  right he rains over you  or you  for most of my life i thought you know you're just walking outside and getting  hit with the rain with the rain so maybe i never understood this song i don't know 
[01:48:30]  rain on me  it's rain it's rain  r-e-i-g-n  yes right  so this has nothing to do  it's over you  love rain over me  so this has nothing to do with the weather  nothing  oh okay  i don't know why they have the rain in the beginning of this song  well that part does that confuse everybody to make them think it's saying rain on me 
[01:49:00]  of course  everyone tweeting that he says rain on me half for the song right is an idiot  they're just imagining that  they are  oh sorry  now he said cool cool rain  uh-oh  remy green  is this groundhog's day  yeah  sorry  alright alright turn this on  okay  turn this on he makes a good point  it's groundhog day  but we didn't uh we added a little to that  hey  it's mark goodman he's hitting the button for the free programming  um 
[01:49:30]  oh  ah  ah yes  from  alright all you  what is he saying  I don't know  I don't remember  groundhog's day  I took a picture by the way  of me right by that  did you really  it's famous  it's famous now  cause it's part of the commercial  yeah so I'm gonna um  I'm gonna post it  and show where they ripped  you need to get a shot of the commercial  and do a split screen thing  yes  oh yeah you gotta split screen that  I'm gonna show where they ripped it all  but have someone split screen that for you  cause that  it's not gonna make sense if you just tweet it  well  you need to split screen  like here's the famous spot 
[01:50:00]  you know  in here  in case you know what  what I'm talking about here is  I don't care  I'm just  oh oh oh  oh shit  he's doing it  right outside our building  right across the street  the Charlie Daniels band  I think the devil could beat him these days  fuck  the devil doesn't have arthritis  the devil went down to Georgia  and he was looking for a soul to steal  he was in the bank  and he was way behind  he was willing to make a deal  let's see how you are  they're not gonna play the whole song 
[01:50:30]  right  the devil jumped upon a hickerson  and said  boy I never tell you why  you probably didn't even know it  I'm a fiddle player too  and if you care to take a dare  I'll just make a bed with you  now you're playing pretty good fiddle boy  but they're skipping the devil  sing it like the record  god damn it  that crowd just knocks hair  no  no huh  but how weird is it he's still singing the song  B-Rock  why don't you go there and smash the fiddle over your head 
[01:51:00]  that is raw  when did this song come out  I swear I was a little kid  in the late 70s  and now  he's still singing the song  that's crazy  holy fuck  this song's gotta be at least 40 years old  right  yeah  yeah  when did it come out then  77  around there  that's what I want to  77  79  this is 79  if you remember  that's 35 years ago 
[01:51:30]  this was the one that made him a big like hit  but Charlie Daniels was  pretty big  in certain circles  before that in Southern Rock  right  this was like his big hit  he's got a big old belt buckle on  I listened to him back in like 76  77  really  what were some of the hits back then  I don't even know  oh my god  um  country boy  uh  wild uh  right right  wild hair  country boy  uh  uh

[01:53:00]  he's playing the fiddle  he's proving that he's  good at it  the devil would beat him  so bad right now  I always wonder what Steve Dahl  was doing nowadays  Steve Dahl playing  Bob  guitar  he's playing guitar  with the Charlie Daniels  good for him  I didn't know he had that talent  oh there's a couple people  dancing out there  that's one of the hosts  oh is it  yeah trying to get something going  no one  like E-Rock said earlier  no one gives a fuck

[02:03:30]  oh I don't even know  of another hockey team  it's all about  the Rangers  first Stanley Cup  appearance in 20 years  I know  crazy  I know  they last won it  in 94  I remember that too  I remember the big  headline on the newspaper  I was working at  St. John's Hospital  in Smithtown  putting in a  ventilation system  in the tuberculosis  wing  a mere few weeks  before the  night time attitude  I hope you didn't get it  no it wasn't that  I used to have to 
[02:04:00]  do the vents in there  though  and there was like  fuzz growing  on the inside  of the vents  it was terrible  what an awful job  that was  but then I remember  you know  it was like  the next day  all the newspapers  holy shit  Rangers win  Stanley Cup  that hurt  as far as  Islanders fans go  yeah  because we were  still waiting  for the drive  for five  well we certainly  were  remember the drive  for five  there was an  Islander dynasty  back in the 80s  a dynasty  and we were able  to say 1940  it was a wonderful 
[02:04:30]  chant  it was  1940  not as  fun as  1940  and then those  fuckers turned it  on us  and now they  say 1980  what was it  I forgot what year  it's like  81  82  83  84  84  85  I think  84  maybe  so I think  they say  1984  I forget  it doesn't fit  it's shoehorning  let's just put it  this way  safe to say  I will not be  rooting for the  Rangers in the  Stanley Cup  fuck those 
[02:05:00]  guys  we're talking  about the  Islanders  not the  Rangers  we know  the Rangers  is 94  we had  an edge  on all  Rangers fans  we were able  to chant  1940  because that  was the last  time they  won the  Stanley Cup  and then they  fucked up the  whole chant  by winning  in 1994  that's my  point here  today  so then they  used our  chant against  us  and started  saying  1984  or whatever  it was  83  1983  but it was  80  81  82  83  yeah  the last  Stanley Cup  that's what  you make  fun of  we were 
[02:05:30]  making fun  of the fact  that they  didn't win  it since  1940  but you  can't look  at it  and say  oh 83  they won  fucking  four years  in a row  and they've  been shitty  ever since  it's crazy  well yeah  that was  30 years  ago  we're over  30 years  Jesus Christ  they're a  shitty organization  and it pains  me to say  that but they  are  I didn't go  to one game  this year  young and  vibrant  and they  have to  play in that  shithole  one more time  one more year  before they  finally get  to Brooklyn  and then we  get to see  fucking  Roland  with an  Islanders 
[02:06:00]  jersey  sure  high-fiving  people in  the subway  Roland really  he loves the  Rangers so he's  definitely high-fiving  people in Arizona  somewhere  is that the  what  is that the  black  or somebody  just make that  just mock-ups  right now  mock-ups  no official  I don't like  the Gortons  Gloucester  fisherman  they would never  go back to  the Gortons  thing  so someone is  fucking around  they would  never do that  that's stupid  there's no way  they would do  that  they would  they would  have the  Islanders  looks like  Marky Mark  in the  perfect storm  yeah  fucking 
[02:06:30]  with that  on the  jersey  stupid  and we're  gonna learn  something today  thank Christ  telling you  we are  Terry in  Jersey  Terry  yo guys  how you doing  pretty good  how you doing  how you doing  how you doing  Charlie Daniels  made the end  of the song  politically correct  what do you mean  the end of that  song  was to be  I told you once  you son of a  bitch  I'm the best

[02:14:00]  have been  like things  I've searched  for online  and you put  stuff in the  search and  you're like  and then you  reach a point  where it's like  I don't even  really care  about this  and then you  just move  on  right let's  say hi  to Sean  that's how  I'm feeling  about fucking  hell  but you're  still in as  far as the  phone topic  goes right  I love the  phone  curses and  songs  we're taking  your calls  that's right  we are  it's bad  phone topic  friday  Sean  hey  on highway  to hell  they say  hell  he double  hockey sticks  they say  the n-word  and he says 
[02:14:30]  uh  monscott says  um  living free  living easy  living free  he's a nigger  on a one way  ride  I've heard  highway to hell  a probably  let's not  exaggerate  probably though  20,000 times  it's  it's  season ticket  season ticket  sorry  it's season ticket  on a one way  ride  that's what it  says on the  uh  on the  uh  the music sheet  but go ahead  and listen  alright let's  listen  oh come on  how far

[02:16:00]  wow  how did we miss that  all the times I've  heard this song  I've never heard that  before  wow  one more time  wow  I even tried to  hear it as ticket  that time  I really did  and I almost  heard a tick  burr  it's like  it doesn't  no  but it's  it's blending  together  you're saying  season ticket  no he's not 
[02:16:30]  what's the lyrics  after that  um  is there a tree  in there  oh  I don't know  is there  what  after that  what's the  how does that  lyric end  okay this one  is just  credit  uh  ask another  leave me be  taking everything  in my stride  don't need reason  don't need rhyme  ain't nothing  I would rather do  oh okay  I mean it doesn't  make any sense  they're saying the  edward  it's just be like  I'm on my way  to hell  hey  one more time  I want to hear  the context  of the beginning  okay  it's plain as day 
[02:17:00]  I would stake  an ass eating  on it  oh really  really  wow  wow  Sean thank you  for that  for real  that one  I hear clear  as day  there's no debate  you didn't hear  the fucking  hell and hey  dude  no  I heard something  in there  I heard

[02:18:00]  plainer  in the house  next door to me  was sold  ticket  it's not as clear  in that song  as it is in this  right  holy shit  all right let's go  rap songs  it's not as clear  in certain rap songs  right  ticket what  yeah  ticket who  let's go to  Georgia Brooklyn  he's got a really good one  as we do  you know  curses and songs  today  yes  good phone topic  great phone topic  yes  my ticket  my ticket  my motherfucking ticket  check your twitter by the way  everyone's hearing the n-word 
[02:18:30]  everyone  of course  I mean everyone  that's a huge surprise  yes  go ahead  where are we  yeah  George Brooklyn  hey guys  what's up  how about  CeeLo Green  forget you  there's a  little alternate version  that's kind of funny  amp  amp  I think you're going to like the video  if you haven't seen it already  the 10 year old  check it out guys  punch it out  it's like we  it's like  there are days  the listeners think  we just came out of some kind of coma  they gotta  they gotta update us on things  oh 
[02:19:00]  the original  lyric is  fuck you  but to get it on radio  we change it to forget you  by the way  I know this song  with the fuck you  because I sang this  at karaoke  last night  right on Broadway  hey  yeah I was saying  on Broadway last night  what part  the karaoke plays  right next door  to the strip club  alright  it's Broadway  it's Broadway  you've made it to Broadway 
[02:19:30]  I was tearing up  fucking Broadway  with my vocal prowess  yeah  you could hear a squeaky chair  right before the  the drums  and won't get fooled again  really  mm-hmm  Keith Mooney  right before the  where he comes in  that's a long  ah yeah  that one I knew  when I was in college radio  we thought that was a big deal  yeah  and I think you could hear  the air conditioner  in that song too  and then you hear  Keith Moon  because he's gotta go  pound away  yeah  you hear him move  his chair up 
[02:20:00]  and you hear a squeak  he's ready to go  right  he's ready to rock  and they didn't take that out  I guess it was hard  to take shit out like that  I found that  that is weird  what do you mean  you hear the squeaking chair  in the  you heard it right  yeah  no one knows this  squeaking chair  why should you care  I understand  but  yeah  here play it  okay  it gets really low  and then it's time  for him to pound  this is off topic  though  this isn't a curse  this is a squeak  listen for the squeak  as Keith Mooney  moves his chair up  I think you talked over it 
[02:20:30]  hold on  here it is  no  it's right before  he hits the drums  yeah  oh god  because he's moving forward  to go at it  this is why the cursing  thing worked better  true  uh oh  I didn't hear it 
[02:21:00]  I didn't hear it at all  I didn't hear it at all  it was dead silence  in the background  did they remaster that one  I don't know  but you can easily  we separated it  we used to separate  the tracks too  so you could really hear it  you could blame E-Rock  on that one  I didn't hear it  I didn't hear it at all  Pete Townsend says  kike in rough boys  does he really  no  oh  yes Sal  oh stupid Sal  I mean Sal  there was a curse  in don't mess with the Zohan  yes  you guys were talking  about Roxanne before  like quirky things  in songs  or that 
[02:21:30]  yeah  when did it become  quirk  instead of curses  well you're talking  about the chair squeak  right  yeah  if you listen to  the beginning of Roxanne  you know there's that  awkward thing in the beginning  and it's like that laugh  it was Sting  supposedly he was like  really drunk  and he sat down  on the piano  oh  yeah  it's pretty  it's I mean  it's something you always hear  and you're like  what the fuck is that  but it kind of works  with the key of the song  actually  what does this have to do  with the squeaky chair  the non-existent squeaky chair  non-existent  and we'll get fooled again  E-Rock heard it 
[02:22:00]  there's something right there  oh shit  E-Rock  look it up online  because now I look like a fool  here  let me try it again  yeah let's try it again  oh  right there  you didn't hear that  holy shit  I could barely  tell that you were  playing something  yeah usually  give us a little lead up  let people settle in  a little bit  Jesus Christ  and relax their ears  what  did you hear that  what  back now  did you hear it  I could hear that 
[02:22:30]  sound in one note  right  try it again  give us a little time  to settle in  just a little  couple seconds  I heard  nothing  I used to hear this  clear as day  so I don't know  what's going on  I don't know if they  cleaned the song up  finally  I want to know  what E-Rock is here  yeah what is E-Rock  I don't hear it  I hear it right before  the sound kicks in  yeah that's what it is  we got a big one 
[02:23:00]  we got a big one  coming in  as we take  curses and songs  not obscure songs  that no one heard  on the radio  this is like  where they're  getting away  with a little  something  yeah  alright go ahead  Austin in Houston  oh I know you  Austin in Houston  yes  confusing  what's going on guys  yeah my whole life  every time I've heard  like an oldies radio  on any radio station  they never  seem to take out  who the fuck are you  from the end of  who are you  that's why 
[02:23:30]  phone topic Friday  is wonderful  it really is  as if  we are doing  this show  for nobody  you just keep  you keep taking  calls until you  you can figure out  how to get right  back to the beginning  right back to it  there's just  who the fuck  are you  we're not talking  about the ones  we all know  already  wow  are we going to  go with a curse  or a weird noise  let's go weird noise  oh this guy says  that the first lyric 
[02:24:00]  the first verse  explains the whole  n-word in  Highway to Hell  Kevin in Louisiana  hey this is Kevin  if you listen to  the first verse  listen to the words  he's saying  and Anthony  you probably  would appreciate it  more  he kind of  explains  what he's getting  into  alright why don't you  read the lyrics  to Highway to Hell  up to the n-word  ok  living easy  loving free  season ticket 
[02:24:30]  or  yeah we know  season n-word  oh boy  season n  right  on a one way ride  right  asking nothing  right  leave me be  taking everything  in my stride  don't need reason  don't need rhyme  ain't nothing  that I'd rather do  going down  party time  my friends  are going to be  there too  yep  I'm on the highway  to hell  that makes no  sense  as far as  any kind of  racial undertones  me and this black 
[02:25:00]  guy are going to  hell  we're going to  party  right  Kevin what are you  getting at  I'm talking about  the first  the first few  words  maybe I heard  the first few  words wrong  the original song  title  MLK boulevard to  hell  oh wow  that makes sense  now it makes  perfect sense  yes  yes  we're going to go  with a strange  noise now  and I still want to  find the squeaky  chair  if someone can help  me out with that  let's say hi to  Doug in Boston  Doug  what's up guys 
[02:25:30]  hey  hey  right before  in Aerosmith's  Dream On  when he says  I see lines in the  mirror you hear  a sniff  like he's doing  blow  yeah well that would  make sense  he would do that  have you ever heard  that before  no  let's hear it  is that the first  so the first  the first words of the  song are every time  I look in the mirror  is that when it is  yes and he says  I see lines in the 
[02:26:00]  mirror  no it's lines on my  face getting clearer  right  something like that  yeah yeah yeah  Jesus fuck  alright let's hear  the snorting though  every time  that I look  in the mirror  all these lines  in my face  getting clearer  the past  that's even  inhaling  he's inhaling  to sing 
[02:26:30]  we've all heard that  but it's just inhaling  he's inhaling  to sing the song  Steven Tyler  used to have  an amazing voice  that's a fucking  pretty damn  good voice  right there  sexy  here's another one  coming in  curses and songs  let's say  hi to Kent  in South Carolina  not what we're doing  and Billy Joel  also drops the  n-bomb  that's coming up  next  but first  Kent  in South Carolina  hey you know  Alice in Chains  man in the box  whenever they do 
[02:27:00]  bury me in shit  like I always  hear that on the  radio  they never edit  that out  man in the box  bury me in my shit  yeah we know  that one  yeah it's pretty  obvious  that one's pretty  obvious  thank you  let's go to  Terry in  Pennsylvania  Terry  hey  hey  Billy Joel  says the  n-word  huh  yeah  in the song  Anthony's song  yeah  the moving  out  I don't know  how far in it is  I know it's by 
[02:27:30]  the polished  offender  at least you can  polish the offender  right  how far in  is that  at least he can  okay  where does he  use the  trading in a  Chevy for a  Cadillac  you ought to  know by now  and if he  can't drive  with a broken  back  at least he  can polish  the fender  and it seems  like it  was the  time  that's what  it's all  about  mama 
[02:28:00]  if that's  moving up  then  moving out  so where's  the n-word  very dramatic  yeah it's not  there  it's no n-word  there  no n-word  anywhere  anywhere in that  song  yeah who  knows  we were  pretty skeptical  about the  ACDC one  yeah really  boy that was  blatant  our phone topic  isn't doing so  well right now  yeah  we need another  n-bomb  why would he say  at least he can  polish  the fender  the n-word 
[02:28:30]  Terry where is it  he's gone  Terry's there  but I think he  might be embarrassed  liar  so where's the  word  yeah where's the  word  I don't know  the exact  verse  something like  nigger can't  dance with  something  but at least  he can polish  the fender  alright go to  that part  the fender  part  yeah I heard 
[02:29:00]  I think  I think he's  saying  and if he  can't drive  with a broken  back  he thinks he  says  and nigger  can't drive  with a broken  back  right  but it's not  that one's not  as good as  highway to hell  let's hear it  again  let's hear  highway to hell  again  well no let's  hear this  at first  and then we'll  see how the  n-word is  properly used  in a song  go ahead  I hear it  it goes  nigger can't  drive  with a broken  back 
[02:29:30]  now I hear  the word  play it again  that's undeniable  yeah  oh my god  he's saying  it  he's definitely  saying it  Sam  wow Terry  with a big  comeback  damn  Terry  we were so  skeptical  boy you're sure  hear what you  want to  don't you  but Billy Joel  is definitely  dropping the  n-bomb  yeah  absolutely  Billy Joel's  a racist  not as good  as AC  can we hear  the ACDC  again  oh sure  please  yeah I have 
[02:30:00]  it  here you go  alright let me hear  I mean that's  as clear as  Billy Joel  it's really  just clear as  day  right there  you know  what really  sucks  that song  is now  destroyed  for me  because I  will hear  it come on  and I will  listen just  to hear that  part  sure  will you sing  along loudly  oh please  I sing that  song every day  really  when you think  about it  you want to go  weird noise  and give me  shelter  give me 
[02:30:30]  shelter  oh the air  conditioner is  in a Pink Floyd  song  I think  how do you  know  like all Pink Floyd  is just weird  shit  no there's  one that  yeah right  maybe they just  put it in there  there's one where  there's like a clock  ticking in the  background  they just left it  in the fucking  song they left  a cash register  in there  oh no it's  crazy  it's the doors  ugh  you're just  naming Bane  riders on the  storm  yeah it was  raining  and then you  hear  it's like  love rain or me  we're back  we're back 
[02:31:00]  full circle  motherfuckers  but let's play  the Pearl Jam  version  love rain  rain or me  rain or me  rain or me  Elsa sang a  little even flow  last night  on Broadway  you did  yeah  um  Ross and  Nolens  or New Orleans  or New Orleans  oh hi Ross  oh hi Ross  and give me shelter  I don't know  if I'm the only  one who hears  this or whatever  uh but when  the girls  start singing 
[02:31:30]  you know  the high part  uh you know  and the girls  go off  there's  there's like a  there's a  woo in there  and I can only  imagine like  they're all in  the studio  and Nick Jagger's  like you know  getting off on  on this note  that she hits  because it's like  one of the  killers  her voice  kind of screeches  and then like  right in the  break and hear  a woo  or maybe it's  just me  I might be  stupid  now before that 
[02:32:00]  before that  yeah  it's like  one of the  middle ones  can we bow  to the stones  for this song  by the way  holy shit  I love this  one  I love that  this is one  of the best  crack vocals  in  fuck  and then the  same guy

[02:47:00]  now I'm just hearing  a bunch of tits  alright  thank you  tit tit tit tit  Yeah, I'm not buying that.  Oh, Billy Joel's talking about running over a black guy in that song.  Oh, my God.  According to James.  And that's how he polishes the fender.  Wow, that sounds like something a grease man would say.  Oh, I thought he was at least giving the guy a job,  but he's polishing the fender because he just ran him over?  Oh, that's Billy Joel.  Should you listen in that context?  Hold on.  Let's talk to James.  James. 
[02:47:30]  Hi, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, he's talking about.  Oh, God.  Listen to this.  Cadillac.  He can't drive with a broken back, but at least he can polish the fender.  That's because he's sliding off the frickin' hood.  Oh, he can't drive because he just got run over,  and that's why he's got the broken back.  Billy Joel hit him with his car.  Billy Joel ran him off probably drunk.  Yeah, Billy Joel's been known to hit a few things.  Right.  Exactly.  While driving.  Yeah.  You know, he's turning a negative into a positive. 
[02:48:00]  You know, he might have broke the poor fellow's back,  but at least he can polish his fender.  Why don't you polish his fender?  Hey, while you're stuck there, why don't you polish the fender?  Oh, my God.  Let's listen.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Oh, Billy.  Billy actually ran over this gentleman.  Terrible.  Oh, pender.  He's watching Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street.  Okay.  Across from the medical center.  And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac.  You want to know by now.  You want to know by now. 
[02:48:30]  Make a cataphy.  You're the broken back.  At least you can polish the fender.  Oh, yeah.  And it seems like you're really fine.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  There you go.  Right at my mother and my girl.  And that guy probably would think it was a waste of time to polish the fenders.  He's like, I just got my back broken.  Terrible.  Because Billy Joel ran me over.  Why would I polish your fender?  It's a waste of time.  Got to go to the medical center you were just talking about.  Across from the medical center.  He's like, no.  Boy, polish those fenders. 
[02:49:00]  We got a guy calling from Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi.  And let's talk about hearing porch monkeys in a song.  No.  Come on.  Did I have to go here?  Mike.  Yes.  Hey.  The original version of Garth Brooks' Friends in Low Places.  Towards the end, when everybody comes in, they're all singing.  There's clear as day a guy who yells porch monkey.  No way.  Not Garth.  I will live in boot.  Get your glass of champagne. 
[02:49:30]  Mm-hmm.  Last one to do.  Last one to show.  Let's go.  Remember when this guy was huge?  He was giant.  And then he...  Crossover artist.  Then he completely goes away.  Garth Brooks.  Wow.  Young Gary Shandling introing Garth.  Is that going to help me?  Here.  Well, I got friends in low place.  It's weird and wicked ground.  And the beer chases my blues away. 
[02:50:00]  Garth refuses.  And I'll be okay.  Garth won't put his music...  Hell, I got...  He won't put his music on iTunes or Spotify.  No, that's just a fad.  What a weirdo.  What happened to him?  It's a good song, though.  Oh, we don't have to hear the whole thing.  It's near the end.  I think I heard it. 
[02:50:30]  This is a different version.  I heard it.  I think this is it.  No, put it where you had it.  Yeah.  I think it's this one now, when it goes. 
[02:51:00]  I got friends in low places where the whiskey...  Watch.  Right on this little break.  The chase is my blues away.  I don't hear anything. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  What a waste of time.  You know how hard it is to concentrate that hard?  It's terrible.  Why would Garth be like, okay, in this part, you yell Porch Monkey at me.  Garth never said that.  He would never have said that.  No one in the song says it.  Let's say, hi, Steve and Bloomfield.  Hi, guys.  Where's Bloomfield?  ACDC again.  Who made who?  They say Niggertown.  No, they don't.  They do.  Jesus Christ.  Why would they say that?  Why would they say that? 
[02:52:00]  Now, I've heard this song plenty of times.  What part?  Very close to the end, about 220 in.  220 in.  This guy's giving us a time stamp.  Okay.  I have a different lyric.  This was...  I'll let you guys, because last time I was wrong, obviously.  All right.  We're going to maybe hear...  This was part of the Maximum Overdrive soundtrack.  By the way...  Stephen King's terrible movie.  By the way, I choose not to say the word.  If I say N.  Good for you.  N-word.  I wish ACDC and Billy Joel would make that choice. 
[02:52:30]  Let's go.  I choose not to say it.  Oh, wait.  E-Rock has found it.  I found it.  He might be right.  He might be right.  I got it.  There's no way.  There's no fucking way.  Let's listen to E-Rock.  Go ahead.  There we go.  Steve, thank you.  You're welcome. 
[02:53:00]  I feel it going round and round.  Running out of chips.  You got no line in the nippin' town.  Oh, my God.  This is the most racist band I've ever heard.  They hear the words.  They just can't write one song without that word in it.  Do you want to know what the credited lyric is?  Yes.  Running out of chips.  Right.  You got no line.  Right.  In an 8-bit town. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, sure it is.  Sure it is.  Let's listen to it again.  You tell me what you hear.  Mm-hmm.  Running out of chips.  You got no line.  You got no line in the nippin' town.  It's not even close to it.  What are you hearing?  Oh, he's dropping bombs.  He's dropping bombs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You guys want to hear a toilet flush in Penny Lane?  What?  Come on.  There's no toilet flushing in Penny Lane.  Cody at San Antonio. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, hey.  I was just curious if you guys had heard that.  At the end of the song, around 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  That's what I've always heard as a kid, but I swear it sounds like a kid.  Where?  How long in?  Right after he says, and meanwhile back, and then he's just whoosh, and it's a toilet flushing.  I swear it is.  2 minutes and 30-something seconds in.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  That's what I mean.  Wow. 
[02:54:30]  That's not a toilet.  That's what it sounds like.  It's not a toilet.  You don't think one of the producers just left the bathroom open and flushed?  That's a big wall of sound.  I think it might be an accidental toilet flush.  You think?  I think so.  Ringo was fucking squirting one out while somebody was over dubbing his drum tracks. 
[02:55:00]  He was coming out of the bathroom.  Get off the drums, Paul.  After dropping some hammers.  My job.  He was mad.  He knew if he didn't flush and run out of there, someone would replace him on the drums.  So he had the door open.  He shuts and fucking flushes.  He always shits with the door open.  With the door open and keep an eye on his drums.  To make sure Paul McCartney's not redoing his track.  Allegedly.  Paul is back on that drum school.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi.  Stop.  Get off me drums. 
[02:55:30]  I'll stop shitting with the door open.  But he can't stop shitting.  No, I've got to take another dump.  Don't redo me drum tracks while I'm trying to take a dump.  We're going to come back strong here because there's a rattle break in Sweet Emotion.  Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, there was an interview with Steve and Tyler.  He said right at the beginning, you hear the rattle going.  I think the fourth or fifth time, it just cuts off real short. 
[02:56:00]  He says because it broke.  But they kept it in.  They should have had a didgeridoo at the beginning of this song.  I think a didgeridoo would have fit very well.  There's a nigga on a didgeridoo.  He's just describing my season. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know.  That's a dumbass.  Fucking ACDC.  Racist ACDC, man.  ACDC is terribly racist.  Where?  Before it gets into the lyrics.  What?  Where are we with the broken rattle?  If the rattle just stops.  What if they just didn't want to use the rattle anymore?  It's in there.  It's like the fourth or fifth time.  It's before it gets to any of the lyrics. 
[02:57:00]  That's it.  That's it.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, that's...  I have no idea.  No, we don't know that one.  That's supposedly the sound of a rattle breaking.  Oh, fuck.  No, it's the rattle they use.  Yeah, got it.  Remember that one I was saying earlier about losing interest completely in something? 
[02:57:30]  You don't want us to explore the rattle?  I could give a shit.  About the rattle?  ACDC's dropping end bombs.  And we care about Aerosmith's broken fucking rattle?  I guess there's a lot going on in Highway to Hell.  There's a lot of misleading lyrics.  Yeah, huh?  Someone said they were going to send me a link, but I don't see it.  A link to Highway to Hell for multiple incorrect wording for lyrics.  But I don't have the link, so...  It gets clearer every time. 
[02:58:00]  It does, right?  It gets clearer every time.  With each playing.  If that's what it's all about  Mama, if that's moving up, then I'll bet  You want to know by now  You want to know by now  Nicky can't drive with a fucking fender  I'll accept fucking fender  You guys?  Right.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Billy Joel says, uh, Nicky.  And not the N-word. 
[02:58:30]  And we got Nicky on the phone right now.  What?  Who swears this song is about him or her.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Nick in Brooklyn.  Nick!  Yeah, I know.  Nick's songs about me, motherfucker.  Nicky!  Right?  You made that clear.  I stand corrected.  It's Anthony's song, dummy.  Nicky.  Nicky can't drive?  Uh-huh.  With a broken back.  Yeah, it's a cough at the beginning of that Pink Floyd song you were talking about. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I know the cough.  What does Brenda Lee want, though?  Oh, I'll tell you what Brenda Lee wants.  What does she want?  It's a tree that's the Christmas spirit break.  Later we'll have some fucking pie.  We'll get you somewhere early.  Have some fucking pie.  We are children.  We really are children.  She's going to have some fucking pie.  Some fucking pie.  Let's go to Kim in Cincinnati.  Kim.  Hi there.  Hi.  How there? 
[02:59:30]  I just thought I'd satisfy your curiosity.  It's not as funny as the N-word, but it's a cough at the beginning of Wish You Were Here.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Is it a real one?  I think so.  I think that was one of those.  I think it's the drummer, but...  I still want the squeaky chair from The Who.  We've still got to solve that.  And then this will be a complete phone topic today.  Yeah.  Is he going to cough, supposedly?  Or is he, like, plugging in his amp or something?  What is this?  Go ahead.  Wish You Were Here. 
[03:00:00]  It's the whole album.  They sure liked wacky sounds.  It's the whole album.  It's not Wish You Were Here, the song.  Holy shit.  I think that's the start of what...  I wasn't going to click the remaster.  Shine on You Crazy Diamond or something?  That's a great song.  Yeah.  I think I heard that.  I think it's a star nonsense.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Now, what is it?  I'm sure.  It's Bob Kelly.  It's Bob Kelly.  It's Bob Kelly.  It's Bob Kelly.  It's Bob Kelly.  Oh. 
[03:01:00]  How long?  This shit's great when you're on the weed.  But, uh...  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  No, he doesn't.  He goes around again.  He goes around again.  Yeah, but we got people that are mad that we didn't hear porch monkeys.  There's more...  There are more people saying it's in the song.  Come on!  Mark in Maine said we had the wrong version or something.  Wrong version.  Go ahead, Mark.  You guys didn't even get the right version of Garth Brooks. 
[03:01:30]  It's hard to find him on YouTube.  I think he's got it all blocked because of the copyright.  He's all over YouTube.  That was some fucking cover.  There's all kinds of Garth Brooks covers.  That was him!  No, bullshit.  I used to listen to that song so much.  When I was a kid, I wore it off the fucking tape.  It was definitely...  But it was him, but it was a live version.  No, it wasn't live either.  No, there's a double live version.  The song that we heard was Friends in Low Places.  I think it was the version that he put out on the Best Of album. 
[03:02:00]  There's an extended version.  That wasn't fucking Gareth Brooks, though.  You could tell by his voice.  If you look up the original version,  it sounds like it says porch monkey in the end,  but I think the guy says once more.  But you can hear it on the end of the original version.  All right.  The original version.  Right.  All right.  I don't care.  And it might be the extended lyrics version.  No, I don't care again.  All right.  Let's go on to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, John.  John in Jersey. 
[03:02:30]  No, my name's Johan.  Supposedly, Cheryl Crowe says N.T.,  and every day is a winding road.  John, are you there?  Today is a winding road.  No.  No, John.  All right.  Wait, what did she say?  Holy shit.  You know that song,  We Built This City by Starship?  Yeah.  Breaking news.  Dave in Milwaukee.  Dave?  Yeah, if you listen real closely, 
[03:03:00]  I think they say something else.  It's My Dick's All Shitty.  No way.  They actually say My Dick's All Shitty  and We Built This City?  It's right up front.  What?  Do we have that?  Do we have that anywhere?  My dick's all shitty.  Oh, wow.  Am I hearing that?  My dick's all shitty from the door.  My dick's all shitty.  This guy is screaming to get this.  He's so passionate about it.  Oh, you know.  I love that MIDI, horrible MIDI karaoke. 
[03:03:30]  Damn.  Damn.  Can't believe they got away with this on the radio.  Yeah, this will be in your head all day.  Enjoy it.  Say it won't blow me.  Say it won't blow me.  Like it in your face.  Say you only take the cock in your dirty face.  Now I'm all filthy. 
[03:04:00]  There's too real my dick.  Too real my dick.  It looks just like a black mask.  But not quiet and stiff.  It's harmonized.  Right.  It's his impassioned yelling that I love.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  There we go.  My dick's all shitty. 
[03:04:30]  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  My dick's all shitty.  It's not really even lined up.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  All right, we've got to go back to Highway to Hell.  Ryan wants to head to Highway to Hell.  Ryan in Philadelphia.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, my buddy, he thinks that...  My buddy, wherever I go, he goes.  My buddy.  My fucking buddy.  My fucking buddy.  I teach him all the things that I know. 
[03:05:00]  My buddy and me like to climb up a tree.  My buddy and me.  We're the best friends could be.  My buddy.  The hell's that from?  My buddy.  I don't know that.  My buddy and me.  I don't know it.  Kid fucking sister.  It's child of the 80s stuff.  All right, go ahead there, Ryan.  He thinks in Highway to Hell it says,  Cheesy nigger with a runway light.  That could be.  Would you take a listen to that?  That makes no sense. 
[03:05:30]  Let's hear that.  Why hasn't anyone told us about this?  My God.  Cheesy nigger on the runway light.  No, no.  I think it's undeniable.  I think he's wrong about that.  I definitely hear the N-bomb.  I hear she's a...  But there's no runway light.  No, let's go to Jim Westchester.  There's another song with the N-word in it.  Oh.  Yes.  Jim.  Pearl Jam.  Yellow Ledbetter.  Second line the song says, 
[03:06:00]  On the porch, a nigger sat.  Wow.  I've heard that song a million times, too.  Yellow Ledbetter.  The first line.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Okay.  All right.  Let's just listen to it first.  Don't let it...  Don't spoil it.  Spurl it.  Don't let your mind play tricks on you.  Don't spoil it.  You got it?  Yeah, here you go.  First fucking line, huh?  It's too bad, because I like this song.  I'd like to hear a little bit of it.  I guess... 
[03:06:30]  Sad.  Nice hearing it.  Nice.  What are we going to sing about today?  It's horrible.  It gets so racist.  I want to see them  on a porch, a nigger sat. 
[03:07:00]  He's saying that's it.  Come on.  What?  Did we pass it, Jim?  No, wait.  The part that sounds like...  Jim, did we pass it already?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  On the porch, a nigger sat.  All right.  That's fine.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  Let's listen again.  Let's listen again.  It's undeniable.  People have subliminal racism.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to see them  on a porch, a nigger sat. 
[03:07:30]  I hear it.  I do.  I actually hear it.  On a porch, a nigger sat.  He couldn't tell...  He was a little scared.  He couldn't totally commit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because then he was like,  oh, boy, this could get me in trouble,  so let me just...  But I've got to express this.  On a porch, a nigger sat.  On a porch, a nigger sat.  Let's hear it again.  When you hear it once,  you hear it a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's definitely...  It's definitely there.  It's undeniable.  Undeniable.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to commit, though.  That's the key here. 
[03:08:00]  It's true.  Whoop.  On a porch, a nigger sat.  He knows it's bad  because he doesn't want to commit to it.  But the art there,  he needs to express...  That's terrible.  ...who is sitting on that porch right now.  That's terrible.  I can't believe that.  But he's definitely down with it.  He's doing the N-I-G-G-A. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Wait, let's hear it one more time.  Okay, you're right.  I'm surprised by Eddie Vedder.  Yeah, shit.  I'm a porch, a nigger sat.  Yeah.  I want to see them  on a porch, a nigger sat.  The sat is very...  The question is,  the caller says he's using the A,  but Opie, you think he's using the E-R. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, he's going all E-R.  That's a huge difference.  But he doesn't commit.  He's a little scared.  Eddie Vedder would never do the E-R.  He's the man of the people.  Oh, he's the N-I-G-G-A.  He's down.  All right, thanks, guys.  They suck dick in Beast of Burden.  Let's go to Bill in South Carolina.  Bill.  That's Joe.  Sorry, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  That's all right.  Yeah, in Beast of Burden,  in the lyrics,  it says,  Mick says,  I'm going to suck it up.  But it's clear as day.  He says,  I'm going to suck it dick. 
[03:09:30]  Mick Jagger wants to suck the dick.  That's crazy.  I've heard the rumors over the years  with what?  David Bowie, was it?  David Bowie had to have his stomach pumped.  He had so much jizz in it.  Right.  Exactly.  That's true, right?  Like five other artists did, too.  We could listen to all of Beast of Burden.  That's fine,  because that's a great song.  But what part of the song is it in, Joe?  It's in the second half.  All right, go second half.  Yeah, second half.  You see where it's at?  Yeah.  You see the actual lyric?  No, of course not.  Of course not. 
[03:10:00]  Mick's sucking dick.  Uh, okay.  I'm going to be listening to the Rolling Stones  and the Police today after this radio show.  Fuck.  Okay.  It's coming up. 
[03:10:30]  Suck a dick.  Suck a dick.  Hang on.  I was sickness.  I was suck a dick.  Oh, that's what he said.  I was suck a dick.  That's what he said.  But it has sickness before that.  I was sick a dick.  I was suck a dick.  What does the lyric say?  It's saying all your sickness. 
[03:11:00]  The lyric or what?  Yeah, the lyric.  The lyric says all your sickness, I can suck it up.  Which makes sense.  All your sickness, I'll suck a dick.  Right, but he's saying all your sickness, I can suck a dick.  He's basically saying, hey man, I'm no homophobe.  I'll suck a dick.  Right, right.  Right?  Let's listen again.  He's like, fuck you.  It's embarrassing when you're 12 and you sing that song.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, let me hear that.  All your sickness, I can suck a dick. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, sickness, I can suck a dick.  That's what he says.  Yeah, it is.  Playing his day.  Mick is sucking dick.  Oh, goodness, I can suck a dick.  Yeah, he's sucking a dick.  He's sucking a dick.  Mick is sucking a dick.  Thank you, Joe.  Pass that one.  Yep.  And we found the squeaky chair, but I'm telling you, there's a squeaky chair.  I'll get fooled again.  This is enough about the squeaky chair.  Robin of Buffalo.  A lot of people calling in about the squeaky chair. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I think the squeaky chair is at the end of A Day in the Life, at the end of the  long piano ending.  Right.  Paul McCartney gets out of his chair and walks out of the room.  How do you know?  Were you there?  I think you're at the piano.  What do you mean?  How do you know he didn't walk to get, you know, some water or something?  How do you know Ringo wasn't going to the bathroom and he was getting up to sit in his  fucking seat behind the drums.  Now I gotta go fix Ringo's abortion drum tracks.  He just finished and he's like, now I gotta go fix these fucking drums. 
[03:12:30]  I see you, Paul.  Stay off me drum kit.  Stay away from me drum kit while I take a dump.  Let's hear the squeaky chair.  But this is not the squeaky chair I'm referring to.  I heard something. 
[03:13:00]  I heard something.  Was the phone hanging up?  I heard it too.  Was the phone hanging up?  No, I heard it.  I heard it.  Oh, I heard it.  I heard it.  I heard it at the very, very end there.  I heard it.  Because he's got to keep his feet on the sustain pedals, right?  So he can't get...  It's actually on film, too.  It's on film.  Got it.  Really?  All right, listen.  Mark in Iowa says the yellow lead better lyric is actually horse cum glitter. 
[03:13:30]  All right, let's take a listen.  That could be it.  Mark.  Yeah, that yellow lead better, it's horse of glitter.  And another thing that I don't even like to have assholes.  But they don't ever sing.  When he sings that song at concert, he says he never really ever sings it the same.  He'll throw other words in there.  You'll have to be rare.  I bet I know one word that doesn't change.  I'll have to be rare.  I'll have to be rare.  I'll have to be rare.  I'll have to be rare.  I'll have to be rare.  That's why he changes it up. 
[03:14:00]  He's scared shitless.  Oh, yeah.  The times have changed.  Right.  So it's like if I sing it a whole bunch of different ways, no one will notice that I actually said the N word.  Let's hear it again.  The other way I sing it.  Let's hear it.  Are we thinking it could be horse cum glitter?  Or horse glitter?  I don't know.  All right, let me hear it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  He's so sane.  Oh, my God.  He's so sane, the N word there.  And we didn't want to believe the guy.  I know.  That explains a lot about this being Travis's favorite band.  No horse cum in that song.  That's all racist.  That's very racist.  Let me say hi to Jason in New York.  Jason.  Hey, it's a very...  Did we really do this for over an hour?  This is so stupid.  Yeah, we skipped a break.  Jason.  Everybody wants some Van Halen. 
[03:15:00]  At the very, very end, if you turn up the fade, you can hear Dave Lee Ross say, look, I'll pay you for it.  What the fuck?  I'll pay you for it.  What the fuck?  In reference to prostitution.  I want some, too.  His dumb, talking, singing.  All right, let's take a look.  Oh, yeah, I know this stuff. 
[03:15:30]  Look, I'll pay you for it.  What the fuck?  Yeah, what the fuck?  But they fade the fuck really quickly.  But that's supposed to be.  Yeah, I kind of remember that one.  Let's see.  This guy.  Brad in Kansas.  Brad.  Brad.  The famous stand-alone fruit call.  You can hear a door closing.  You're talking about Fez and his blueberry ring.  Can you hear the door close?  Yes, you can.  And what is that door closing? 
[03:16:00]  That's Ronnie giving up.  But for some reason, Ronnie keeps coming back in.  Ronnie, get over the drums.  Did you want to hear to see if you could?  Please.  You could hear the door close.  Well, no.  Well, let me hear the door close.  All right, just get to the door close.  The blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[03:16:30]  The door closing is so telling.  It's the best thing ever.  Because Ron left.  Ron just left the studio.  He was basically saying, fuck this.  He left the studio.  He listened to Fez and he's like, yep, Fez got this.  If that was on an airplane, Ronnie still would have left. 
[03:17:00]  He would have just walked out of an airplane at that point.  We blew off so much shit today.  Holy shit, did we ever.  But you know what?  Phone Topic Friday.  Successful phone topic today.  Let's go to, uh, remember that song?  That's what's important, isn't it?  Yes, yes.  You know the song Magic by Pilot?  You know it if you heard it.  This guy's got a little something on that.  Jordan in Youngstown.  Jordan.  Yeah, the song Magic by Pilot is actually my dick.  If you listen a little closely, you can hear my dick instead of me. 
[03:17:30]  It's my dick.  It's my dick.  He's saying it.  It's my dick.  He's saying it.  I've heard that song so many times and never picked up that he's saying, oh, oh, oh, it's  my dick.  Just listen to some guy singing about his cock.  Right.  Keep going.  Let's hear how many times he says my dick.  You know he called up with this because he used to sing it that way as a kid.  He's probably in the car.  Right.  Like this would come on the radio and he'd sing my dick and he'd get yelled at for it. 
[03:18:00]  Stop saying it that way.  Those aren't the lyrics and you know that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's my dick, man.  Dean Martin's guilty of doing this shit.  Dean Martin?  Are you kidding me?  Come on, in Jersey, John.  Fucking pie.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, Dean Martin's version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  He says, Rudy the Red-Dick Reindeer towards the end.  He just throws in, towards the end.  Towards the end.  Let's hear it. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Toward the end.  Let's stick to the end.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, hey, wait a minute.  What?  I think it's actually in the lyric.  He doesn't even try.  Rudy the Red-Dick Reindeer.  What the fuck is going on?  His dick was red, too? 
[03:19:00]  These are national treasures that are doing this talk.  This is crazy.  Christmas with the Rat Pack.  Go back a little.  Let's hear that.  One more time.  Fuck.  Dolph, myth, you are no so bright.  Won't you guide mine sleigh tonight?  Then are the reindeer loving.  As they shout it out with glee.  Rudy the Red-Dick Reindeer.  He's not even trying.  Rudy the Red-Dick Reindeer. 
[03:19:30]  Very good, brother.  Very good.  Thank you.  So glad I didn't break the mouse yesterday when I threw it a few times or we wouldn't have  had this fine phone topic today.  Amazing.  Well, I mean, there's so much.  Please don't procrastinate.  It's no good to masturbate from sexual healing.  I mean, I guess that would make sense.  I think they were allowed to masturbate for a while, right?  Like, that's not like Brenda Lee wants some fucking pie.  Right.  You know?  Bitch.  That filthy bitch. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  Rock the Casbah says, fuck the passport?  That's what that song's all about?  Wait a minute.  Let's go to Jay in Kansas City.  Jay.  I thought it was just, fuck the Casbah, actually.  No, it's, uh, it's, uh, fuck the passport.  He's thinking about, they can't get a passport to get over the border, and he's pissed about  it, and that's what that whole song's about, and he's saying, fuck the passport, fuck the  passport.  I thought it was, fuck the Casbah, fuck the Casbah.  Then why would he say, fucking the passport? 
[03:20:30]  No, just fuck the passport, like, screw the passport.  But part of it, he says, rockin', so he says, rockin' the Casbah, fuck the passport?  Yeah.  Exactly.  What?  Exactly is right.  I'm with this guy.  Relax, Sam.  All right, you need a passport to get to the Casbah.  Is that Hayden Penn?  All right.  Yeah.  A little weird.  I never liked her.  She's a little weird.  She's like a little fire hydrant.  She would be really hot if you could stretch her.  She needs to be stretched. 
[03:21:00]  I'd stretch her out a little bit.  She's like a shrinky dink of a real woman.  A stretching rack or something.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, can I see the, uh, before we leave, which, ooh, we're in OT.  You're actually in extra OT because you skipped a break.  That means you're going to have to cut some of the show.  Yes.  What part?  Definitely no phone topic Friday parts.  Oh, no.  I mean, that's a staple of the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I do remember Sal walked in at some point.  Oh, we can get rid of Sal.  You should just.  Get rid of Sal.  Sal is always a good safe bet to cut out of the show if we need time. 
[03:21:30]  Do we have any Sal that we can?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll just cut the Sal.  Let's trim the Sal.  I think we're a little slow starting today.  Somewhere like.  Yeah, you guys will figure it out.  No, I felt like you guys were on fire all day.  I love it.  Look at that.  Mark Goodman's in the hall.  Maybe if we cut out every reference to Mark Goodman.  Fuck, dude.  We pull this out of our ass.  Constantly.  Constantly.  We weren't going to do this today.  Hell no.  We had topics to talk about. 
[03:22:00]  Well, we found out Pearl Jam, ACDC, and Billy Joel are all racist.  Which is the best one out of those three?  I would say ACDC because they're extremely racist.  I don't know, though.  Billy Joel, man, running over ends.  It's pretty rough.  Because that totally reworked the context.  And Eddie Vedder's just with an observation.  Let's break this down.  Eddie Vedder, he's driving somewhere down south, and he just, that's an observation.  Terrible.  It's a side street.  He's looking at all the houses, and he sees one of the porches. 
[03:22:30]  ACDC degrading a woman a little bit.  A black woman.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Billy Joel is the most racist.  He's running them over.  And he's running them over and turning it into a positive that at least now his bumper is polished.  Polishing the fender.  Yeah, like, while you're stuck to the hood of my car, shine my fender.  I didn't think, see it that way.  I saw, as he hit him, just his clothes and stuff polish the fender.  Isn't it nice when you can really look into it like that? 
[03:23:00]  No, but his back is broken.  His back broke.  Because he hit the fucking guy from the back, and as he flew across his fender, he shined  it a little bit.  Sure.  In more ways than one.  Right.  So, you know, yes.  Black Country Woman by Zeppelin has the N-bomb.  Oh, all right.  Dean Martin loves singing about reindeer.  Reindeer dick.  Red reindeer dick.  We're just looking for a good out.  This guy might have the good out.  I hope so. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Aaron in South Dakota.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hello.  Jig Isles and Song Centerfold.  Instead of Angel is a Centerfold, it's Grandma Has Camel Toe.  Is that true?  If I even remotely hear this, it's not going to make my day.  There's no fucking way.  There's no way.  Oh, no way.  Check it out and try it.  What part?  What's the original lyric?  Angel is a Centerfold.  Angel is a Centerfold. 
[03:24:00]  This was a huge song.  Oh, okay.  So it's right at the hook.  Yeah, I know.  The hook's throughout the whole song.  It's the hook?  You really don't know this song, Sam Roberts?  Maybe I'll know it when I hear it.  Oh, my God.  This was a huge song.  I don't know it by name.  Here we go.  Oh, I know that song.  It was an early MTV hit.  Oh, of course I know this song. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, it might be his grandma, though.  Angel is a Centerfold.  Oh, what did he mean solo?  My memory has just been solo.  No.  Angel is a Centerfold.  Ah.  Wait, wait.  It can't be the hook.  That's just something that rhymes. 
[03:25:00]  My grandma has a camel toe.  It just rhymes with it.  That's not...  I knew it wasn't going to work.  You didn't like that one.  I knew it wasn't going to work.  All right.  Let's end with the Reverend Al Sharpton teleprompt.  Oh, teleprompt.  Volume two.  Volume two.  Volume one was a hit.  And what?  The same guy came up with volume two?  Yeah.  All the times he fucks up words while he does his show?  Yeah, we fuck up words here ourselves.  Yeah, but not...  I'm pretty guilty of that. 
[03:25:30]  You're not newscasters.  Oh, thank you, Sam.  You know.  Let's hear this.  Volume two.  Should we end with this?  Why not?  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to end with this.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  But what?  Oh.  Hey.  I did it.  Sabado.  Holy shit.  Manana.  I like this.  Sabado.  Sabado gigante.  Sabado.  Oh, my God.  So, fin de semana.  Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday.  Wow.  This is like getting a gift.  That's right. 
[03:26:00]  I like these two-day weeks.  Yeah.  We're going to have to do more of these.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  We end with this.  And we will much about that be committed.  So, there's no real conflict.  Michael Drunisky.  Drunit?  Druniac.  Including Lincoln himself.  Daniel Days Lewis.  We're behind Monica Lewinsky.  The one and only Trey Song is here.  Allison Lundgren, Grimes.  Gina Day Jesus. 
[03:26:30]  You and Gina Day Jesus.  Tea Party challenger, Matt.  Matt Bivitt.  People don't want to have their Social Security overall.  The Republican savior, Mark Rubio's big night.  And evolution and Galeo.  I mean, this whole thing of Galeo.  America's changed, changed.  Unless IT and skillets, President Putin doing something similar back in. 
[03:27:00]  It won't change this fundamental fact about the GOP.  Just how absurd these attacks is.  Nearly six months after the dangerous traffic jam.  The Thai military says,  My friend for many years,  Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana, Iyana.  There's nothing there. </pre>
