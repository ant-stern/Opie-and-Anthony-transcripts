<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a phone interview with comedian Doug Stanhope.  High on a self-invented drug cocktail he called "Xanadu" (Xanax and mushrooms), Stanhope discussed his upcoming Edinburgh Fringe Festival appearance, his strained relationship with his mother, his views on life and death, and various drug experiences, including a hilarious bad trip fueled by mescaline and a Charlton Heston movie. He also mentioned updates on his website regarding Opie and Anthony, his rivalry with Dane Cook, and his relocation to a small Arizona town. The hosts then played a bizarre public service announcement about LSD featuring a talking hot dog.  Opie followed with a story about his CB radio days as "Diamond Dust" and a disastrous date with "Dreamweaver."  Jim Brewer then joined the studio, sharing crude and profane anecdotes about his time on Saturday Night Live, focusing on Norm Macdonald, David Spade, and Tracy Morgan.

The show continued with a rambling discussion beginning with an anecdote about a tense situation with a radio producer, involving a planned Dave Lee Roth impersonation and the producer's subsequent emotional breakdown.  This led to a conversation about a difficult work environment, featuring backstabbing and negativity, prompting contemplation of quitting.  A Norm Macdonald bit was played, leading into a discussion about offensive jokes, including one about being proud of a gay son. A fictional news report parodying Tom Brokaw investigating JFK Jr.'s supposedly faked death and encountering mermaids followed.

Anthony then shared lengthy details about his childhood, including his crying tendencies, difficult relationships with his parents (including his father's infidelity), and a near-sexual encounter with a friend in a treehouse, hinting at a later-realized homosexual attraction on the friend's part.  More childhood anecdotes involving embarrassing crying episodes were recounted.  This segued into a discussion of a news story about public sex acts in a New Jersey park, including an interview with Club Soda Kenny, a former undercover officer who described using his appearance to catch perpetrators.

A phone interview with Tommy Lee, intended to promote his new album, then took place.  The hosts repeatedly attempted to steer the conversation towards Lee's legal issues with Pamela Anderson, including accusations of him giving her Hepatitis C.  Lee became increasingly agitated, using derogatory terms and hanging up multiple times. He claimed his publicist had agreed to avoid the topic, which the hosts denied.  The hosts called him a "pussy" for avoiding the questions. A caller, Luke, defended Lee, but the hosts argued that since Lee sought publicity, he should answer difficult questions.  The segment ended with the hosts mocking Lee and contrasting his behavior with that of Phil from Pantera, whom they praised.  They also discussed the nature of celebrity interviews and public expectations.  Another phone call with Tommy Lee later occurred, where the conversation was again dominated by Pamela Anderson's health, resulting in Tommy Lee again ending the call abruptly.  The hosts ended the segment by criticizing Tommy Lee's behavior and reflecting on the challenges of booking celebrity guests.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen. 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Just before break, we got word that Doug Stanhope was on the line. 
[00:04:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, Doug Stanhope.  Ladies and gentlemen, Doug Stanhope.  Is there any other kind of tripping?  Hi, Doug.  No, usually when you're tripping.  The PR kind of radio, right?  The what?  I should keep my P's and Q's, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, some P's, some P's, some Q's, you know.  All right.  I'm just making sure.  You know the game.  Yeah.  What did you...  Hey, what did you take, Doug? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, actually, we, well, we've been doing mushrooms all night, but, but we just invented our own  cocktail because they didn't know if we should keep tripping or go to bed.  So we made a, we call it the Xanadu.  It was a, we blended up Xanax with equal amounts of mushroom caps in a coffee grinder  and poured it into Jaeger shots.  Xanadu.  We called it a Xanadu.  Wow. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  We, we invented it.  Yeah, I would say you did.  I don't think anyone else would have come up with that.  What else could a Xanadu be?  Two glasses, one totally empty and one with milk.  I'm not.  So, um...  But if you find out about a bar selling them, I'm a regular.  It's you.  Wow, man.  So you, you're really feeling good.  Oh, yeah.  We're, we're, we're trashed.  I gotta go over to Scotland in a, like, a day. 
[00:06:00]  What are you doing over there?  The Fringe Festival.  I gotta be there for a whole month.  So now I'm, like, practicing for being absolutely out of my mind all the time.  Because UK comics make, yeah, make American comics look like, yeah, Norton gets on and stuff.  And we're just so, you know, we're out of the norm.  Dude.  What are you gonna...  How are you gonna get your, uh, how are you gonna get your, uh, how are you gonna get your, your, your drugs over there? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, they have drugs over there.  Over there, it's like the old days of having fun in America.  Remember that?  Remember when fun used to happen?  We didn't have to invent it or just make fun of other people that have it?  Yeah, they're still in those days.  Like, they don't have websites or, they're still, like, just raw, the, the good comics I know over there.  They, CD, what? 
[00:07:00]  No, I'm still coming in with a beer at 8 a.m.  Doug is the worst nightmare of everybody that does anti-drug ads.  Because he's the one, he just makes it sound so much fun.  Like, so much fun, like something you want to do.  No, no bad stories, right?  You're just having fun.  Well, well, no, I mean, you die at the end.  That's the bad story.  I mean, for all of us, but, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Why, at some point, do you have to go, well, okay, yeah, well, that was fun when we were at Mardi Gras and we were 22,  but that fun must not have been real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you guys been having some of those deep thoughts tonight?  Some of those way out thoughts?  We start having conversations about stuff that you don't remember the next day,  but it was so deep, like, you were curing the world's ills in one evening,  and then the next day, you forgot it or you remember it, and it sounded ridiculous. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, Captain, I've been doing this stuff for a lot of decades,  so it's not like a way out thought that I don't remember is out of the ordinary.  It's not like I'm experimenting.  I'm almost 40 years old, for Christ's sake.  What have you guys been talking about tonight, though?  We've been talking about, I don't know, what have you been talking about?  When you were off the air and you could talk without the FCC busting your butt. 
[00:08:30]  Well, we were talking about crazy things that go through your head sometimes  when, like, you're at a funeral and you kind of get it in your head,  standing up and maybe pushing the casket over,  and what a ruckus that would make,  but your brain kind of tells your body not to do it.  All right.  We've been talking about the same thing.  My buddy Joby, his best friend just blew his brains out,  and he was a little reticent to trip tonight because it just happened.  Yeah, that would kind of make a bad trip if he starts thinking about it.  Yeah, my mother is, like, hopefully going to die soon. 
[00:09:00]  She's on emphysema.  I just swallowed that F-word.  Yeah, but I didn't think you swallowed enough of it.  No.  So his mom's got emphysema?  No, my mom.  Oh, your mom.  Yeah, she's going to, yeah, Norton knows mother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like your mom.  Yeah, she's a funny mom to everyone else,  but to me she's just annoying,  and I hope she dies soon.  She's a joyless douche. 
[00:09:30]  A joyless douche?  Does she smoke or did she smoke?  Yeah, my mom knows that there's nothing left in her life except to be alive,  and, yeah, I hope she dies soon.  And so, yeah, we've been talking about stuff.  But that doesn't freak you out when you're tripping,  like, to start thinking about that kind of thing,  because then you start thinking about your own mortality.  It makes you laugh when you're tripping,  because you realize that we die at the end.  It's all this ego, like, Hollywood stuff that makes you laugh. 
[00:10:00]  Like, you're just watching, like, any kind of entertainment tonight,  kind of stuff.  Like, who takes this seriously?  How can I continue making jokes like I care about this?  Because you die at the end.  Like, everything you're doing now is based on that fact.  I go on stage every night with that thought.  Why even try?  You're just going to die at the end of it.  Dude, don't you and your mom get along really good? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, no, no.  I've hated her for ten years, Norton.  Are you serious?  Well, since she moved in with me, and she's been a liability,  she made herself a liability to me,  and she will make no steps towards getting...  She's completely a disability and all that.  She can take care of herself, but she chooses not to.  Okay.  And I don't have the time to go through the, like, problems of, you know,  the red tape.  Yeah, get on the dole, baby.  Do you have to do things like clean her up and stuff? 
[00:11:00]  No, no, she's not that.  But she was, like, they had to airlift her for emphysema to the hospital,  like, to the ER, and they had to vacuum her, vacuum out her lungs.  Oof.  What the hell was she smoking?  Well, she's been smoking cool menthols for 48 years or something.  Yeah, she had her on a ventilator, and I'm sitting there watching her die.  I thought she was going to die for sure.  And I'm watching her die on a ventilator after they had to suction out her lungs while she 
[00:11:30]  was aware of it.  And I'm still looking down at her going, that makes me want a cigarette.  Jesus Christ.  That was an honest reaction.  Dude, does she still smoke?  I still smoke, yeah.  No, does she still smoke?  I'm a light one.  Does your mom still smoke?  Oh, yeah.  Well, actually, she's been on the patch for five days.  How is the patch a bigger, like, deterrent or a bigger reminder than vacuuming your lungs 
[00:12:00]  out?  Like, she is really hooked on smoking, I guess.  Exactly, yeah.  And you're smoking, too, so you're probably going to have, like, the same fate.  Well, yeah.  I think I could die from a lot of things sooner.  I hope to not have the same fate.  Right.  I hope to have one of my other fates greet me first.  Greet me.  I just wrote a big update, and we're tripping. 
[00:12:30]  I go, you know, this is a perfect call, because I just wrote a big update about O&A for my  site, and my web guide didn't get it up.  I'm working all day on it.  And then I just clicked on it.  My update's not up on my site.  Wait, did you talk about us on your website?  Well, no, you guys had mentioned me a week or two ago.  Anytime you guys mention me, I get a flood of MySpace emails, which is very cool. 
[00:13:00]  No, we thought it was really cool that you gave us props on your latest CD.  Oh, well.  He gave us a little shout-out from the stage.  And then you couldn't understand why the Howard Stern fans and the Opie and Anthony fans  can't get along, or something like that.  Yeah, no, and that was kind of the point of the whole thing.  Like, I actually had to take out part of the update, because I tried to assimilate.  Like, Dane Cook is my comedy nemesis, but he has been forever, and I tried to put that 
[00:13:30]  into the update, but it was, like, too convoluted, and I re-read it.  Like, Dane Cook is someone I, like, I hate as a comic, but I don't have a problem with  him as a guy.  I live in a town of 6,000 people right now.  Where the hell do you live?  Jesus.  This is Arizona, down on the Mexican border.  And I took a month off.  Easy to skip over the line if he needs to.  Huh?  I said I took a month off, because I thought I needed it. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And I just had to tell my buddy, as we were tripping, if Dane Cook and Larry the Cable  Guy walked into my local bar after a month off in a small town like this, I would have  hugged them as though they were dead relatives.  Just to have someone to communicate with.  You can't.  Like, all right.  You really have no one to talk to.  Rivalry and artists, whatever.  All right, we can talk like human beings. 
[00:14:30]  Doug, why'd you move to that little teeny town?  I don't know, midlife crisis?  Midlife crisis?  You buy a vet or something.  Yeah.  I had to get out of L.A.  It was just, like, that ego nonsense was, I think we're going to move to Austin in January.  You're just a nomad.  Hey, Al.  You're like Kane from Kung Fu.  What do you think about, uh.  Only stoned.  What do you think about Mel Gibson? 
[00:15:00]  I hate the Jews.  Doug doesn't care.  No, I hate the Jews, too.  You do?  Yeah.  For what reason?  Because I only hate the Jews that have to bring up that they're a Jew.  Why do you have to keep saying they're a Jew?  That was the first thing I thought, because I don't watch the news when I'm off.  Yeah.  And I put it on, and it was, like, 56 minutes of Hezbollah, which is the Jews. 
[00:15:30]  And then there was a five-minute, here's a, what if Revelation is really coming upon us?  And then, finally, we'll end it with a human interest piece about Mel Gibson eating the Jews and getting a DUI.  All right.  Next time I get, if I get a DUI, I don't drive drunk anymore, because I'm so overdue for a DUI.  You figure you've been lucky, so.  Oh, it's hugely lucky. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  But if I do, I'm going to go, I hate the Jews.  Can I get pressed?  I have to live down this man show thing.  Can you arrest me?  Jesus.  Hey, Jeff, you ever seen it?  I get girls gone wild, I've got to get out of my, to be a respectable comic again.  Not only do I hate the Jews, but I'll be appearing at the Houston Improv.  But, no, I just hate it.  Like, if you came up to me and go, you know what, because as a Lutheran, and you prefaced everything as being as a Lutheran, what does that matter? 
[00:16:30]  You would hate the Lutherans.  Jews.  Well, you know, because I have a Jewish background.  What does Jew mean?  Shut the fuck up.  I don't know.  I think too much of the sea got in that time.  Yeah.  Doug, you're down in Arizona, and you do peyote.  No, just mushrooms.  Mushrooms?  No, okay. 
[00:17:00]  I was going to ask you if you ever had one of those, like, Indian kind of...  No, we did.  Me and Tom Rhodes did the other night on the same batch of mushrooms.  On our bellies, vomiting, and in our own waist.  I urinated in my own pants for almost an hour on a heavy dose of the same mushrooms.  But we did mescaline in the desert this May, and that was the first time I found mescaline.  But, yeah, people don't do good drugs anymore. 
[00:17:30]  They do tweak, and they're all coked up, and it's all, like, pointless drugs.  I haven't even heard of anybody that's done mescaline in 20 years.  That was one of my favorite drugs.  I never found it until this year.  Mescaline just made you laugh.  Yeah, exactly.  Just giggle.  Oh, that's fantastic.  No, I watch mountains melt.  It's one of the most miraculous...  And I'm 40 years old, so...  You watch mountains melt in the desert, man.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's fantastic.  Wow. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I watched french fries under a heat lamp once.  Just turned, like, a kaleidoscope, it looked like.  Every single french fry was a different color and was changing colors like chameleons.  Oh.  Really amazing.  Last time I did mescaline.  Have you ever had a bad trip?  I didn't have many trips, and I wouldn't trip if...  I probably tripped, like...  And it was always mescaline.  Probably about three or four times tops.  Once was at a Van Halen concert, and it was the first time I ever did it. 
[00:18:30]  84?  Yeah, probably around 84 or something.  And it was at a Van Halen concert at the Nassau Coliseum out on Long Island.  And I took it and didn't know...  It hadn't hit me.  Everybody else is like, dude, I'm peeking.  This is great.  You know, Van Halen's up there kicking ass.  And everyone's laughing on the way out, so I'm like, dude, I'm driving.  You guys are all too screwed up.  I didn't make it out of the parking lot before it hit me full blast.  It starts raining, so the wipers had to be turned on, and they're going like... 
[00:19:00]  And streaking every light, like the stoplights and the streetlights would streak because of  the rain, and that made it even worse.  And the radio started talking to me, like...  And I just started laughing my ass off.  I didn't know...  I was going down the parkway.  I didn't know if I was doing five or 80 miles an hour.  I was driving all paranoid but laughing. 
[00:19:30]  It was...  That was the first time.  But after that, probably three more times, but never had a bad one.  But I would never do it if I was in, like, a bad place or in a bad mood.  Or if my mother had emphysema.  You learn when you're younger.  Yeah, that's why you call it experimentation.  You learn, yeah, I'm going to clean up my whole house because Discord makes me crazy.  You're in a comfortable, safe place to do this, away from authority figures.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then we ridicule the way we live. 
[00:20:00]  I couldn't do it after a friend's death or if my mother had emphysema like that.  I couldn't trip.  I had a bad time once just smoking too much weed and watching Grey Lady Down.  It's some Charlton Heston submarine movie.  And they went down and got into an accident.  And then the sub was sunk at the bottom of the ocean.  And they were trapped.  And they couldn't get out.  Dude, I freaked out.  I felt like I was in the sub and had, like, the worst anxiety attack. 
[00:20:30]  I had to run into my room.  I was pretty much in the fetal position sucking my thumb.  It was one of the most awful.  You can watch bad Charlton Heston movies while you're tripping.  We just watched a movie at the end of a trip just to try to come down.  And that's when we discovered these Xanadu shots.  Xanadu.  To decide whether we should keep tripping or go to bed.  And tripping won.  You've got to be in a good place. 
[00:21:00]  Self-reflection.  Oh, I wish this update was out.  Watch my set later.  Like, after I bust my webmaster's balls.  Some guy, like, when you mention me, whatever you mention me,  like, I always get a flood of MySpace, but I get this, like, perfect MySpace email  from a fan of yours, and in the worst English, like, worst, hey, you, 
[00:21:30]  like, you have to decipher what he's trying to say.  You know the MySpace email.  Yeah, I know the feeling.  And the guy's name is Bob, and he's trying to make me decide.  Like, it was, they mention you, that's cool, but you have to decide between Opie  and Howard.  Yeah, it's like anti-matter and matter.  The two can't be in the same place.  Nah, we don't play that game.  He plays that game. 
[00:22:00]  But you have to see the picture of the MySpace.  That's what's great about MySpace is they give you a picture of the guy you're  talking to.  And the guy has this, like, big, stupid, oversized Mardi Gras hat with a half-toothed  smile, and he's from Jersey, and he's talking about, well, unless you want to go  with the Howards, like, he's going to invite you to his Hampton house, and I  brought this whole update that will eventually be up.  It should have been up now, except I have a day for a web app. 
[00:22:30]  We'll check all day for that, Doug.  Yeah.  Doug, we've got to take a break, because, you know, it's FM radio.  Yeah, that's all right.  We might call you back, because we've got a PSA we've got to play for you.  Have you ever bitten into a hot dog and heard it scream?  And talked to you after doing any LSD?  We got an LSD PSA that's going to make you laugh really hard.  From, like, the 60s.  I'm hanging on the line.  All right, we'll keep you on hold, all right?  Doug, hold on a minute.  All right.  Doug Stanhope, everyone. 
[00:23:00]  Doug Stanhope.  Check him out on his MySpace.  It's a real deal, man.  He has a drinking problem.  Wow.  Wow.  He's a rock star, though.  We talk about that.  Not many rock stars left.  Yep.  All right, we'll continue in just a bit.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hopefully, Doug Stanhope's still here.  Doug. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, I'm still here.  Hey, man.  All right, before we let you go so you can continue to trip, we've got to play this thing for you.  This is a real LSD PSA that they played back in the day.  We're thinking late 60s, maybe early 70s.  All right?  All right.  I'm with you.  I'm just enjoying the show.  I don't have XM, so I'm happy just to listen to you.  We're not out there yet, huh?  We're not in that 6,000-person town?  Well, this would be Arizona.  I'm in a town of 6,000 people, for Christ's sake. 
[00:24:00]  You know, that's a perfect, perfect town for XM.  You've got to get the XM.  I'm sure local radio's not getting it.  We have a free series radio, and I can't even get the satellite out here at all.  You can probably get XM, though.  There's a lot more repeaters.  All right.  Here we go.  The LSD PSA.  Either one's better than terrestrial.  What?  What?  All right.  Here we go.  Listen to you.  Here we go.  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night. 
[00:24:30]  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  Did he?  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever, but I kept sitting there  waiting and waiting, and nothing was happening.  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green 
[00:25:00]  and brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  Sounds cute.  Green and brown is asking for it, by the way, your dress.  Serves a PlayStation.  She's a real looker, this one.  Yeah.  So far, so good, though.  So far, it sounds like a good enough day.  She dropped a little acid or something.  No real problem.  No, I got some pretty clothes on for the year 1969, whatever the hell it is.  Horribly awry.  It's groovy, and then I started hearing some music, so things can't go well. 
[00:25:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  It gets ugly.  Yeah, here we go.  Back to it.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog.  I was very hungry, and I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual, and I put 
[00:26:00]  the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said no.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder. 
[00:26:30]  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  We know what a face is.  I took to where it looked like his hair, and he started telling me that I couldn't  eat him, and he had a wife and seven kids at home to school.  It's a Mexican hot dog.  I can't hear the dialogue because of the music.  What? 
[00:27:00]  I can't hear the dialogue because of the music.  I know, the awful music.  It, like, drowns it out.  Well, she looked down at the hot dog, Doug, and it looked like a face, and then the face  is talking, saying it has seven kids at home.  Yeah, it looked like a Duke lacrosse player on a penis.  I get it.  I get it.  Had a face, a nose, a mouth, eyes, ears.  The ketchup looked like hair.  Yeah, the ketchup looked like hair.  The message is, I must feel like a whore for putting out, because otherwise, if I just 
[00:27:30]  give it to my natural sexual urge, then a guy won't have to work 60 hours put into overtime  to get a spoiler for his Honda that might attract me to maybe giving him gratification in the  toilet.  Is this what you're getting from this?  Wow.  Nice buzz.  Yeah.  I think the hot dog is some kind of, you know, thing there.  The hot dog, but the point is, yeah, any drug that makes you not produce is against the 
[00:28:00]  law, any drug that will keep you dumb and happy in a 60-hour-a-week cubicle, yeah, that's  legal.  All right, let's get back to the story here.  All right.  He had a wife and seven kids at home to support, and I stood there with this hot dog and asked  Terry, do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  Thanks for the help.  And I told him, look at the thing, he's got a face, and he's screaming. 
[00:28:30]  And the guy finally looked over, and he got on the same trip that I was on.  Look at the, you know something?  This bitch just screwed up the other guy's good trip.  Poor Terry.  Poor Terry is just hanging out.  He's having a good time.  He has to battle having a girl's name to begin with.  Just wants to get high and enjoy himself.  Have a little acid.  Enjoy the time.  Maybe get lucky with this whore later on.  It's a 60s.  Free love.  He's tripping with a, yeah, hot piece of ass.  Yeah, he's going to be getting some. 
[00:29:00]  She brings up a talking hot dog.  He's like, nah, it's nothing.  Meaning, bitch, shut up.  Leave this alone.  Don't think about it.  Don't go there.  She brings it up again.  He looks.  Oh, Christ.  It does have a face.  Now, it ruins his trip.  Maybe.  Killjoy.  Maybe it was his hot dog.  Maybe, yeah.  Just not talking.  Just put it in your mouth.  He doesn't know well enough to leave her behind to go walk around the neighborhood.  Yeah, just leave her alone, man. 
[00:29:30]  And the hot dog had one eye, and it was looking at me intensely.  They're kind of bad trips.  That's for rookies to deal with.  That's why you have youngsters like butters hanging around.  Drop her off at the hospital and just leave.  Yeah, well, it gets better, so.  Go, I'm waiting.  So Terry has acknowledged the face on the hot dog?  Yeah, Terry now is starting to get into the same bad trip that this broad is in.  Here we go.  He got on the same trip that I was on.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog. 
[00:30:00]  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating, so I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud.  That's Terry screaming.  I see this a whole different way now.  They never left the apartment.  They never left the apartment, and that's Terry screaming his ass off.  She was tripping that they bought a hot dog.  He drew a face on it.  Yeah, just to be silly because they're tripping. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, this should be fun.  Boy, Terry was driving, and that scream was the tire screeching.  The guy I'm tripping with is kind of a new friend of mine,  and we're down in a small town on the Arizona border.  So he doesn't understand that I'm hearing, and then I put it into my mouth.  And he's like, I thought you were on the radio.  And you go, just I'll explain later.  Bear with me.  Yeah, bear with me.  Jesus.  All right, so I backed it up a little bit. 
[00:31:00]  Here we go again.  I decided I was just hallucinating, so I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town,  so I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  Opie tactic.  She's using the Opie mouse technique.  It's the same thing Lorena Bobbitt said.  Why would you have to step on it?  Why not just put it down safely and gently? 
[00:31:30]  Because it was suffering like Opie's mice and the glue trap.  This is a monster now.  You've got to put it down and you've got to kill it.  That's probably just a drug.  Biting it and stomping.  She's stomping, thinking of all its children.  Poor Terry.  He's just in San Francisco, the heyday of the hippies.  He's just trying to get some action.  He's got some chicken capris and a smart outfit.  Summer of love with some dope.  There's some dope that's destroying his manhood.  I don't believe it's a hot dog anymore.  She's got a nice unconditioned braid in her hair. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Hairy armpits, dirty feet.  Yeah.  How did they play this thing?  Was this like in front of every good movie that you had to sit?  No, this kind of thing used to play in schools.  They would like get an assembly together in school and play this along with, you know,  Hamburger on the Highway, that movie about driving in Driver's Ed.  I remember, honestly, in, I guess it was sixth grade, a science teacher telling us that kids  who would sniff glue would die and be so deformed that their parents couldn't pick out their bodies 
[00:32:30]  in the morgue.  Sounds cool.  I never thought about sniffing glue, but it occurred to me later on, wait, wait, they  were teaching me this in public school.  Yeah.  Such disinformation that it destroys, like this, yeah, there's drugs that are bad, but once  a kid learns that, hey, if I smoke a joint, I'm probably not going to blow my friend's 
[00:33:00]  head off.  Yeah, it was always smoking a joint and you would, you know, if you were the babysitter,  let's say you're babysitting and you smoke a little reefer, you would put the baby in  the oven and the mother would come home and find the turkey upstairs tucked in into the  crib.  That was always like the story.  And she'd go to check on her baby and go, where's my, why is there, why is there a turkey  in the crib?  And run downstairs and the babysitter would go, no, the turkey's in the oven.  And the mother would open the oven and scream because her baby was cooked in the oven because 
[00:33:30]  the babysitter smoked a joint.  But the thing is, once kids realize that one of those, am I there?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're there.  Yeah.  Once kids realize that one of those things is garbage, they discount all of it and they  go, well, I guess heroin must be just as easy as pot.  Like if you're going to have PSAs, make them all on us.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get to the end of the story here.  We got 40 more seconds.  I'm waiting.  I'm all night.  There's a great ending here. 
[00:34:00]  So loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  Jesus.  I realized that I had murdered it and I took off screaming down the street, scared. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Running.  She ran down the street, just scared.  Nothing makes me want to slap a woman more than when they scream like that.  Because she murdered a hot dog.  Wait, wait.  Is there a video of this?  Yeah, there is a video.  Did you see it?  You're going to have to tell me how this PSA ends because I can only, the sound effects  are screaming over the dialogue.  Yeah, I saw the video or a piece of it just recently. 
[00:35:00]  It was on something I think maybe the Daily Show was playing or a Colbert Report.  It was playing like a piece of it.  And yeah, there's video.  It's all groovy and done with like those light shows that used to be done with oil, paint,  and the overhead projector.  Kind of thing like that was going on in between.  Like an old Black Sabbath video.  Yeah, something like that.  Exactly.  Kaleidoscope things going on.  Wow, wow.  And Doug, I'll tell you how this ended with Terry in the emergency room going, why did  she do that to me? 
[00:35:30]  Why?  She's jumping up.  Why?  Why?  All right, we got a break.  Doug, we're going to let you go, all right?  Hey, thanks for having me.  I have an update coming out to you, but I'll be in Scotland for a whole month, so I won't.  But I'll talk to you soon.  Have a good trip.  All right, watch, don't eat any hot dogs in the next 24 hours or so.  Or if you do, make sure they're white.  Thanks for having me on when I'm tripping.  It makes me feel good.  Right on.  Doug Stanhope, checking that on MySpace.  All right, Doug.  All right.  Peace.  There he goes. 
[00:36:00]  Love Doug.  He's out of his mind.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Nicky Six.  You're listening to the worst, I mean the worst, of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Gary Wright, and you're listening to a bit that I made famous.  It's Dreamweaver on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ant used to pick up a little CB horse.  This was...  Come on, man.  Remember the big CB radio craze?  Of course.  I was like in my early teens, and it was a way to get girls, you know? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Here he is.  Um, Breaker, Breaker 1-9.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah, um, Breaker for a radio check.  You're coming in four by four, good buddy.  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there like, yeah, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10, 10, 10-8 on the side waiting for you, good buddy.  There. 
[00:37:00]  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know...  I'm double nickels all the way.  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some purdy seat covers here today.  Down the old blacktop.  Keep her between the ditches, good buddy.  Yeah, well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  Hmm, I'm just on the CB.  Oh, I gotta explain this. 
[00:37:30]  This just never...  Explaining never works on this show, does it?  I was living in California at the time,  and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse.  Uh-oh.  And I used to ride.  And my handle, because I ran a rent string.  This guy I knew had a rent string,  so you used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton  that wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend  and guide them up in the hills. 
[00:38:00]  So I was like the guide.  And I'd take them up there and then go down,  back down the hill and get the next batch  and bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler with...  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy.  The butt wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Uh, Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust?  Fag! 
[00:38:30]  That's worse than...  What's Diamond Dust?  That's worse than Butt Wrangler?  It wasn't Butt Wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler was a guy on a horse  that got together the livestock.  Diamond Dust?  I don't know.  Say, you got the Diamond Dust.  Hello, Diamond Dust.  You out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  What? 
[00:39:00]  Got your ears on?  Ah!  This here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck, what's your...  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves,  good buddy.  Big fan, for sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  Clean, clear to fly, town.  Oh, dude.  I'm kidding.  Oh, big fan.  Shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely got the front door,  good buddy.  Mercy sakes alive.  We got us a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate? 
[00:39:30]  Hey, there's a chick in a roller skate.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels  up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy, taking pictures,  giving away invitations.  I'll be, uh, be back.  I gotta go 10-100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there? 
[00:40:00]  We got us a Tijuana taxi.  Whoa, I just got passed by a crazy man  on a crotch rocket.  You better watch out for the Smokies.  Come on, everybody.  All right, all right.  Meet you up at the Chokin' Tube.  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this, uh,  this girl that I used to, uh,  communicate with on the,  on the, the Citizens Band. 
[00:40:30]  And her handle was Dreamweaver.  You dick.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  And she sounded hot.  Yeah.  So I invited her, uh,  down to, uh, ride horses.  The key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What?  What do you look like, Ant? 
[00:41:00]  Uh, shut up.  All right, go ahead.  So, so I was all excited  for my little date  and I saddled up, uh, my horse  and, and the other horse  and, uh, kind of shut up.  Dreamweaver,  I'll, uh, I'll meet you down  at the stable  at two o'clock in the afternoon.  This is the Wrangler,  over and out.  Dreamweaver.  So I'm all psyched.  You're an ass, man.  And, uh, so, uh, 
[00:41:30]  all right, so you're,  I saddle up my horse  and I, I spend time, you know,  brushing the horses,  making sure they look all good  and everything.  And then I saddle up  the other horse  and I, I take the reins  and put her on the saddle horn  and I'm, I'm, I'm kind of  trailer in the other horse,  you know, down to meet her  by the river bed  where we were going to ride.  Well, well, she comes, uh,  walking up  and I see kind of  in the distance  and I'm like, 
[00:42:00]  okay, that must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say  that you had the 10  and everything  and you were hoping  to score in the woods, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I, I packed like a whole thing,  uh, uh, saddlebags  are all packed up  with some, a couple of beers  and I had bedrolls  and a tent  just in case things went well  because we had a bunch  of hills to ride up in  and stuff.  I'm going to camp out  with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, tell your mom,  um, you're going to be,  uh, spending the night,  Dreamweaver.  Tell her, tell her  you're at a friend's house  because we're going  to camp out. 
[00:42:30]  This is the Wrangler.  I'll run out.  I'm 10, 10, 10, 8.  On the side, Dreamweaver.  Looking forward  to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was  gravely disappointed,  the horse that had  a carrier looked pissed.  I wasn't sure  if I should take  the saddle off of the horse,  put it on her  and let the horse ride her.  Dreamweaver.  She was huge. 
[00:43:00]  Dreamweaver.  I believe you can get me  free to ride.  All right.  Yes, I was,  I was gravely disappointed.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver.  I believe we can get  the horse ride.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver.  Ah.  So, Dreamweaver was a big...  So, she's like, are you,  are you a Wrangler?  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  Please don't be Dreamweaver.  I'm Dreamweaver.  All right, let's,  let's go for a ride.  So, we, we went like,  uh, up and down the riverbed  for about an hour.  I was like,  oh, look at the time.  Here I had like bedrolls  on the back of this thing.  It was like,  I was pawingles  going up to,  to Walnut Grove.  I was going to go over the river  for a week.  To go get supplies  for the family.  I mean,  I had this thing packed out.  Like a pack mule.  You were ready to rock.  I was like a prospector.  I had crap hanging off the horses. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready to rock.  I was,  oh, ready to rock.  You were a Dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt her food  that I realized looking at it  I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know,  we used to hunt.  We were hunting little rabbits  and stuff.  Feeding her would be,  forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison  left on the plane.  I could live off your thigh  for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed  because she's talking  that she, you know,  oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neill.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her,  you know,  I let her off  and she rode off  into the distance.  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do  a drive-by on horseback?  Well, I'm the only guy  with two horses?  One empty?  Are you a Wrangler?  No.  You should have.  No, just looking for, 
[00:45:00]  another girl.  You should have tried  to, like,  meet her in town  or something,  did the drive-by  to see what she looked like.  The whole thing was riding up  like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You gotta remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like,  maybe 13 years old  and this was  mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me,  this was in San Juan,  Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  You used to ride.  This was what we did.  You know? 
[00:45:30]  And I'm like,  I had firearms on me.  I swear to God,  I had a pistol  just in case I had a fight  for her honor  for any bandoleros.  Meanwhile,  they'd have been,  you keep her.  We don't want her.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was like,  I was so pumped up for this  and so was she.  Pumped up.  But, yeah,  it was very disappointing. 
[00:46:00]  But,  to bring it all back  to the beginning of this story,  she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed that hard  in a while.  My eyes are tearing.  This song brings back  memories every time I hear it.  I gotta tell you,  to this day,  when I hear Dreamweaver,  I think of the whole day,  how happy I was  and psyched  and how disappointed I was  riding back to the ranch  that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story.  Thank you, Opie.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  92.3 KROQ.  It's the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  We get the best SNL dirt 
[00:47:00]  during the commercials.  Yeah.  I was just telling you.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Norm was my,  he was the best, man.  Norm rocked.  He just,  I told this story last night,  but when we had the press,  this is when I knew Norm,  Norm rocks.  As soon as I got the show,  you know,  you have this big press conference.  Yeah.  And you're like,  oh my God,  I'm in makeup  and they're putting clothes on me  and I'm getting pictures taken.  They're finding out  about my background. 
[00:47:30]  I'm meeting the head of NBC.  This is exciting.  Well, we're up there  and they give us a big lecture.  Now, they're going to ask you questions.  Just think about  how you're going to answer them  and they're going to say  some bad things to you,  but it's the press.  It's cool  and they're really prepping us  and they're really being cool about it.  Well, you know,  they ask like Sherry.  Sherry O'Terry says here,  you were in the Groundlings?  Yes, and I loved reading it.  I loved Santa Claus my whole life.  I just wanted to be a Santa Claus.  This is the most exciting time in my life.  Sorry. 
[00:48:00]  Norm MacDonald,  I've got to ask you this.  You're the veteran,  Tim Meadows,  David Spade.  You guys are the veterans.  Everyone knows  this is such a frat house atmosphere,  which it's not.  This is such a frat house.  What kind of practical jokes  are you going to play on the guys?  You're going to have to dump out,  so be prepared.  Uh-oh, wait.  Can you put it in a way?  Just use the first letter  of the bad word.  Norm goes,  I don't know.  We're probably going to...  I swear to God. 
[00:48:30]  I swear to God.  I can still picture that.  I can guarantee  none of that made the radio.  We're going to abuse them  in ways that are  from the backside  of the rumper.  But he says this  in front of all these reporters,  you know, TV guys.  Yeah.  I laughed.  And that's when I started,  like, where am I right now?  And we went down to the side  where there was food 
[00:49:00]  when it was over,  and I went, Norma,  you think that was cool?  And he's like,  let me tell you something.  They don't give two cramps  about you, bro.  You guys are on  a little Chippendales.  Yeah, I'm going to be on the show.  I'll see you in about five months.  Wow.  Oh, man.  It was awesome.  Brutally honest.  Spade right off the bat  saying,  hey, am you thinking out  Norm's crazy? 
[00:49:30]  Norm used to hate Catan.  Hated Catan.  Well, I did too, man.  I didn't hate him.  I just had problems with him.  Yeah.  It's just competition stuff.  Whatever, man.  It sounded very,  like you were saying,  high school.  It was totally...  Like, like...  If I can explain to you  show business  is such a goof.  It's just that  there's so much stakes involved.  It's the only thing  that's involved.  It's just like high school.  You just go in.  It's like a little play.  Catan...  Well, we pitch ideas. 
[00:50:00]  We get our ideas.  You know, we sit down.  The best was...  I don't know if I told you guys  this one.  Catan's sitting there.  Garth Brooks comes in.  Everyone's like,  don't forget,  pull out your big ones  for Garth Brooks.  He's going to pull in  a lot of ratings.  So, like, oh,  Middle West loves this guy.  And so they're like,  okay, yeah,  this guy's huge.  So I'm waiting out  for a goat boy out there  or something  trying to get on.  But everyone,  they're bringing the cannons.  Cheerleaders!  Mary Catherine! 
[00:50:30]  So they're all  bringing out their guns.  And Catan,  it's like the second time  he did Mango,  the gay stripper or whatever.  Yeah.  So, uh,  some good acting, yeah.  He comes up and he goes,  I got this idea  where I'm going to do Mango.  And, um...  So Garth goes,  I don't think  Superstar Garth Brooks  is going to do Mango.  Gay Mango.  Unless it's the episode  where he gets  the crap neck out of him. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, man,  it was good time.  And then he wrote,  so check this out.  So now he...  So now, like,  so now the mini war  has begun.  Right.  So, uh,  we go to,  now,  the day,  we read all the sketches  on a, uh,  Wednesday.  Wednesday,  you sit there  and you read, like,  eight hours  of sketches.  And the first thing you do, 
[00:51:30]  you sit down  and you look at the top  and see which ones you're in.  You know,  there's a big stack of them  and the top is a cast  and, yeah,  it instantly goes,  oh, this week sucks.  So the further down you get,  it's like, oh, boy.  Yeah, exactly.  So, um,  but here's Mango  and I see Mango  and I look  and I see Brewer.  Katan puts in  all the guys he knows.  He puts in me,  Colin,  Tracy Morgan,  and Norm.  So,  I'm like,  ooh, interesting.  I pull out,  I go,  now Norm doesn't do sketches.  He tells you right off the bat, 
[00:52:00]  hey, listen, guys,  I'll be in sketches  because I'm going to F it up  and I'm just not going to show up.  So a sketch comedy show  and he doesn't do sketches.  Yeah, what do you plan on it?  I got the news, man.  I'm busy.  That's it.  He just threw the news.  And what's what,  like if he had a killer sketch  and that's the way he was  and you know what,  God bless him for it  and he'd put,  he'd be like,  yeah, I got Brent Reynolds,  I'll do that.  But don't put me  in one of your little gay sketches  in the back.  Don't do it.  I'm telling you right now,  I'm not going to do it.  And he did it, man. 
[00:52:30]  That's great.  So we sit there  and I'm looking at the,  you know,  let me look at this thing here  and it says,  Katan writes  that Norm has to say  that mango,  now this may be,  may not be word for word,  but we're in the ballpark.  That mango is my favorite  all-time stripper.  Gosh, I dream about that mango.  So I'm sitting there  and I give Colin Quinn  an elbow.  He's like,  I know, I know,  I know,  I saw it. 
[00:53:00]  I saw it already.  This is going to be good.  This is the end of it all.  This is great.  I love it.  Holy jeez,  that sounds just like,  I know,  I know,  I know.  So here we go.  Now Norm,  this is funny too,  even when sometimes  he has to do sketches,  you know,  our big catering thing  is, you know,  carrots.  So he's sitting there.  All he would do  is read.  Like if he had to read,  here,  just one line of the paper,  he'd go,  he'd eat a carrot.  Eh, 
[00:53:30]  I'll do this  for a Canadian tonight.  Live,  send me up.  That's the way  he would read your sketch.  No matter what you put in it.  Eh,  Cox Moore  became better than,  um,  Glenn.  So now,  also,  on the read-through,  you have all the,  producers,  you have the network,  you have all the writers,  you have,  uh,  all the people  that are going to do  the costumes,  everyone's going to,  you know,  do the sets. 
[00:54:00]  They're all sitting there  watching while you're  doing the read-through.  we do the read-through  and the host is on the end.  Well, uh,  here it comes.  Now,  of course,  the industry has a lot of,  um,  homosexual  top personnel.  Of course.  So,  that's a given.  So we're sitting there,  Norm goes,  here comes the big line.  I,  I totally,  I'm professional  and I go,  can't wait to see  that mango tonight.  I,  totally professional. 
[00:54:30]  Norm grabs the thing,  he's,  hey,  I contend,  Sherlock's big seat,  honey.  Oh,  that mango loves you.  I wish you just made it right.  Matter of fact,  tonight I'm going to go see him.  I love that big,  oh,  God.  And then he put it down  and he got up  and he walked out of the room.  That is a set of balls.  That's great.  He's like the,  he's like the John Wayne of comedy. 
[00:55:00]  He just doesn't care.  Oh,  it was just brilliant.  Didn't he have an assistant  or someone that had to actually  empty the bottles of urine  from his office?  Well,  it was what,  yeah.  I never actually saw that.  Yeah,  I heard like Snapple bottles  or something like that.  All over the office.  He wouldn't want to leave his office  to go to the bathroom,  so he'd just do it in a bottle  and his assistant,  hey,  can you empty this?  Dang.  Well,  he used to,  he was very competitive  and he'd make us play,  well,  I was too.  At two in the morning,  you have a reader's block,  so I'd get Colin  and a couple guys  and let's play football  in the hallway. 
[00:55:30]  But Norm,  he,  he,  if he lost a game,  he was very competitive,  so he was like,  ah,  that's it.  Lojo,  come here.  If no one to play  and you get this chick,  Lojo,  stay in the other hallway.  We're going to play this game.  I'm going to whip the ball  as fast as I can at you  and you're going to bounce it  and you're going to block it,  all right?  Put your hands up.  And he just,  and the object of the game  was try to hit the wall  behind them  and he'd whip the ball  as hard as he can  and she'd be like,  ow, 
[00:56:00]  that really hurt my finger.  Come on,  I'm going to fang it,  let's go.  But we used to play football  and I got him back one tuck  because he was rough.  He would,  he was dirty.  He'd hold my hands  and hold the,  you know,  pass come to me.  He was a dirty player.  So this one night  I was like,  screw this.  I went in,  got nice and zapped,  in the room.  So I'm ready  for a big football game.  I put on my boots  and I waited  until he was going out  for a pass  and I got behind him  and I kicked him  really hard  in the calf.  Bang! 
[00:56:30]  He was down.  Norm's like,  ah!  Beating guys, bro.  Colin's like,  what happened,  what happened?  Hey,  you can't, bro.  You kicked me  in the goddamn calf.  What the hell  was that, bro?  I said,  well,  don't be a dick.  Don't hold me, man.  You're being a dick.  You don't have to  kill me, man.  Oh my God,  that's funny.  It was the same thing  as high school, man.  Yeah.  Brewer,  can you do five seconds  of Tracy Morgan?  Tracy was...  Listen to Tracy Morgan 
[00:57:00]  and I will say this  about Tracy Morgan.  I've known him  since the Uptown Comedy Club  and I'm telling you,  he has not been,  his true talents  have not been exposed.  I never laughed so hard  than Tracy Morgan.  You will see him one day.  When we were in the same room  together,  Tracy,  me and him  spend a lot of time  and I get frustrated.  People try to steal stuff  from you  and there's just nothing  you can do about it.  Katan.  Katan. 
[00:57:30]  For instance,  there was one time  where,  you know,  it's stuff like,  you know,  you pitch your fake ideas,  but there was one time  where in my room  I have a chalkboard,  right?  And I think Rosie  was coming up soon.  We knew that was  going to be big ratings.  Rosie was huge.  Pull out your guns  for Rosie.  So,  I said,  you know what?  I wrote up there,  Pesci Christmas story.  Pesci Christmas story.  So,  I was sitting there,  I write that up there  and all of a sudden,  here he comes.  Hey,  what you up to?  What you doing? 
[00:58:00]  Hey,  what's up,  buddy?  How you doing?  Oh my God.  What's up?  Pesci story?  What's that?  Sounds funny.  Oh boy.  I said,  well,  you know,  it's kind of,  I was trying to venture  out of the show  and just,  you know,  have Pesci Christmas.  It was corny.  It was just,  hey,  you know why  Rudolph's nose is red?  Because he's a rat.  Whole family rat.  So,  he's going that stupid direction.  So,  I'm like,  but I'm going to,  and he goes,  why are you doing it?  I said,  I'm going to do it in two weeks  when Rosie's on the show.  And he goes, 
[00:58:30]  ah,  that's cool.  What happens?  We go to the read through  and again,  you're in front of everyone.  It's just,  what pops up out of nowhere,  the,  uh,  Al Pacino Christmas story.  Oh no.  You know why  Rudolph  is cuckoo?  And I'm like,  what the,  deke?  Oh no.  And if you run the coaches  and tell them,  you're a faggot.  Right,  right.  Dude,  deal with it.  Listen,  people have ideas  and they constantly go, 
[00:59:00]  you're like,  right,  you look petty and,  yeah,  right.  Now I'd always go back to like,  I go back to Tracy,  I'm like,  yo,  Jim,  Kane killed Abel.  Kane killed Abel.  Over jealousy,  Kane killed him.  So I'm going to take you out.  Should have had Pesci beat up Mango.  But I actually had a run in with him too.  It was,  uh,  and that's,  I was so pissed.  I was so pissed.  Cause this is like the second,  third episode. 
[00:59:30]  It was another corny one with,  uh,  I was,  I did some radio thing and we were talking about 80s metal.  And I just started goofing around to Dave Lee Roth.  Whoa.  I didn't even do him that good,  but I started saying,  you know what?  What a cool idea.  And the radio guy was like,  you know,  you should try that as a go point.  Well,  I didn't think about that.  So I go up and,  um,  I talk about it.  I'm like,  yeah,  we'll have,  uh,  an old time and I'll come out as different characters,  a best of show.  So I can do pre-tape.  So once you know,  what's the first thing I get into the office?  Cause he's never there early jumps.  He's like, 
[01:00:00]  Hey,  um,  I was wondering you doing go boy this week.  It's already picked up.  He's like,  I do a great,  great fan.  Hale and Dave Lee Roth.  Oh no.  So I went,  I took the benefit of the doubt.  I took the benefit.  I said,  you know what?  I got to be honest with you.  Um,  I was in a,  I was just talking about that today.  It's really bizarre.  You brought that up.  Cause actually you kind of look like him and you might even say,  and I didn't have a full idea,  but I did bring it up,  talking about putting him on goat boy.  I was talking about doing a pre-tape.  He's like,  well,  I just thought it'd be funny. 
[01:00:30]  You know,  I come out and be great.  We could do it this week.  I went,  well,  uh,  you tell you what,  why don't we talk about this?  Cause when we're like in a dressing room,  I'm getting ready to rehearse.  I said,  why don't we talk about this next week?  And maybe we could do this for like next week's show or two weeks from now.  All right.  All right.  Two seconds later,  like high school goes running to the head writer of goat boy.  And I see him like Lily auditioning,  kicking his leg up in the head.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:01:00]  And he came over.  He's like,  listen,  Chris has got it great.  And I was like,  where is he?  And it was like high school.  I had to bring him back.  And I'm like,  dude,  what's wrong with you?  What is wrong with,  did we not just talk?  He started crying.  Oh no.  I shouldn't befriend you like that.  You're the only one who talks to me.  It was like therapy.  I would sit him down.  I'm like,  dude,  you can't do this.  A little crying.  Why does anyone talk to me?  Because you're crazy,  bro.  You're crazy. 
[01:01:30]  Quirky Romano.  The little crying.  I didn't see it,  but he's very funny.  He's very funny.  He's very physical.  He's very talented,  but it brings out the high school in you.  I guess so.  I've never heard.  Can you imagine doing it?  Can you imagine me sitting there going,  hey,  Rick,  I got this great character.  I went to an Opie and Anthony show.  I talked to you guys.  Like,  hey,  Opie.  And you're like,  we'll talk about it later.  Rick,  don't tell Opie and Anthony,  but I get to this great gorilla voice. 
[01:02:00]  What?  What?  I've never heard good stories come out of that place.  How as gay is that?  I've always heard like nasty,  backstabbing stuff.  You know what?  And I praise my wife.  I'd come home and I'd be like,  man,  I can't,  I can't deal with it.  I can't,  you know what?  It's too crazy.  She's like,  then quit.  You become a miserable little pothead.  Get off the show.  You said,  the minute work is not fun,  you're out.  Well,  it's not fun.  Get out. 
[01:02:30]  And you know,  and you still pause the,  you don't understand.  Send it live.  And I'm the goat man.  And Joe said,  yeah,  all right.  You know,  go hang out in the balcony and smoke to your retarded and go bitch to someone else.  And that's the part of life you need because it's so truthful.  Put your back in.  You know what?  It's right,  man.  And that's when I got it.  That's when I wanted out.  I love your honesty,  man.  Hey,  I can't kill you for being honest.  And it's just my perception.  That's all.  That is brutal.  I love it.  We're going to take a break. 
[01:03:00]  We found one of our favorite Norm clips.  Oh,  yeah.  I love this one.  We love this one.  This is Norm from,  Dennis Miller.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have a play this a lot.  We love this thing.  Classic Norm McDonald.  Let's all enjoy,  um,  and how he,  how he,  he just goes with his story.  You won't even know where,  you have no clue where he's going.  That's why he's just talking.  And then he hits you right between the eyes.  It takes forever to get to the punchline,  but it's well worth the trip,  man.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically to be in bad taste? 
[01:03:30]  As you look back on it,  maybe at the time you thought it was a good play,  but you look back on it and you think that was in bad taste.  Well,  sometimes like in standup,  I'll do jokes that are,  uh,  that I,  like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience.  They told me,  so I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah,  it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about,  cause I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it, 
[01:04:00]  there were these old men and old ladies like with these signs that said,  we are proud of our gay son,  you know?  And so I was saying,  that's an odd thing to be proud of,  you know,  because it's not an achievement,  you know,  it's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I,  I just wondered,  I just,  I had a hard time believing that these 50,  60 year old men are actually bragging,  you know,  at work like that.  Hey,  uh,  Bill,  you know,  uh,  my kid,  Oh my God,  we're proud of him,  Johnny.  He,  uh, 
[01:04:30]  graduated from Harvard,  you know,  the first in his class,  you know what I mean?  Uh,  and now he's articling over at a law firm and,  uh,  Oh yeah,  he loves.  This kid.  The Opie and Anthony show.  92.  Three K rock.  92.  Three K rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey,  this is Brian Regan and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  Dave writes,  uh,  for your information about two hours ago,  Tom Brokaw was seen scuba diving in the ocean doing a live broadcast to see if JFK Jr.  was faking his death.  He is hoping he will,  uh,  reappear from the water and catch him in the act.  Come on.  Well,  you know,  I don't think Tom Brokaw is in the water.  I believe finally the story's dead and,  uh,  they've run out of angle.  So I wouldn't be surprised.  If,  uh,  you know,  some of the networks did get some scuba divers down there to see, 
[01:05:30]  uh,  if,  if something's going on,  but actually scuba diving,  actually on the beach with scuba gear,  with scuba gear,  ladies and gentlemen,  Tom Brokaw,  NBC nightly news.  You know,  it's strange.  I sound better with a regulator in my mouth than I do just trying to speak normally.  Normally.  Normally.  Hey,  um,  Tom,  Tom,  yes,  Tom Brokaw.  You,  you, 
[01:06:00]  you,  you sound a little out of it today.  Well,  I sound a little lightheaded or something.  I was deep diving looking for JFK Jr.  I don't believe he's dead.  I think it's a big conspiracy.  And I ran out of oxygen 200 feet below the surface and had to ascend so rapidly that Tom Brokaw,  me,  Tom Brokaw,  got into the bins.  Nitrogen bubbles in my bloodstream.  So I'm a bit of a woozy.  But I do believe I did see JFK Jr. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  When I was,  uh,  just before I passed out,  I also saw Ricochet Rabbit and the Care Bears.  They were all doing a dance.  And then someone pulled me out of the drink.  Yeah.  Now,  Tom?  I believe it was the Navy vessel of the grass.  Still on site.  Picking up any lost screw that came from JFK's plane at the cost of millions and millions of dollars. 
[01:07:00]  I was,  I was wowed by Arielle,  the little mermaid.  It was nice.  You know,  she's got nice cans for a cartoon mermaid,  the little redhead chick.  You know,  those mermaids,  very deceiving.  Yep.  Great cans you could,  you know,  feel.  But if you try to go south,  it gets a little fishy.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC Nightly News. 
[01:07:30]  I couldn't tell where the skin ended and the scales started.  As I tried making love to a mermaid.  On my next report,  Tom Brokaw makes love to a mermaid.  Flipping up scales to find the elusive mermaid guy.  You know what the odd thing is?  It smells like human.  What was the toughest thing you've ever had to say on the news? 
[01:08:00]  I believe it was back in the 80s.  It had to be the day that Leon Klinghoffer was thrown off of the cruise ship Achille Gauro. 
[01:08:30]  The Achille Gauro where wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer was thrown overboard by terrorists who took over the cruise ship Achille.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 
[01:09:00]  and I'll just turn back into the depths.  There he goes, Tom Brokaw.  Swimming away.  Tom Brokaw.  Hey, he's having sex with mermaids.  Hey, this is Michael Shiklis.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  I love the conversations here.  Just despicable backstabbing going on.  I love it.  And then the mics go on.  Ding.  And then you hear this.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We like to call it a virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Yes, and it can be transmitted person to person. 
[01:10:00]  Slowly but surely.  We don't need a chicken involved.  Actually, I want to make Anthony happy this morning.  Why?  Well, yes.  If you want, you can sing along, Anthony.  I remember this.  We'd be playing in the car.  Why don't you get a job?  I've been trying.  It's not a...  You try going out there and I'm raising three children for F's sake. 
[01:10:30]  That's where I learned my best dialogue.  All my best cursey words came from mom and dad yelling at each other.  Or it would be playing.  This song would be playing on that big sarcophagus radio TV stereo system that was in every Guinea's living room.  Big wooden carved thing.  And this would be playing.  And mom would be cooking.  And everything would be good.  You'd smell like spaghetti sauce and meatballs in the background. 
[01:11:00]  We're playing, you know, as kids.  And everything's happy.  And daddy would come home.  Daddy!  Yeah, how you doing?  Oh, good.  How are you?  That day.  I worked my ass off today.  Okay, leave dad alone.  He's in a bad mood.  And then you'd hear from the kitchen.  Where the sauce is bubbling.  And there it goes. 
[01:11:30]  Sitting at the dinner table.  Love, sweet love playing in the background.  Hearing just the clinking, the uncomfortable clinking of forks on plate.  No conversation.  Until dad maybe got a look he didn't like.  And then the plate of spaghetti and meatballs.  I saw it.  Slow motion. 
[01:12:00]  Picked up.  Thrown across the room.  No!  Thrown across the room.  Right into the phone.  And he just, you know, stormed out of the place.  And mom's sitting there twirling spaghetti on her fork, aggravated.  I'm in tears crying as spaghetti slid slowly down the 70s floral print wall.  And this song playing in the background.  Everybody! 
[01:12:30]  Right.  Love.  Sweet love.  What a childhood.  When would daddy return?  Who the hell knew?  He had a chippy up in Connecticut.  So he would, like, disappear all night.  He'd come back.  Grr!  Go off yourself.  Grr!  Wait, everyone knew he might have had a chippy, but no one talked about it?  Yeah, no one talked about it.  Because he was, like, the worst. 
[01:13:00]  He was like me when it came to cheating.  Like, just horrible at it.  I'm the worst cheater ever.  Like, they're on to me in a second.  Because I give up on the girl that I'm with.  I just give up.  I don't try.  Yeah, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend.  You're out.  And my dad was kind of the same way.  A couple of things coming in on the instant feedback.  Rob from his mobile device.  The soundtrack.  Oh, no, no.  I'm sorry, Rob. 
[01:13:30]  It just updated.  I actually wanted to read Carl's from Westchester.  Anthony's parents were Sims.  Wish someone else was running it.  And then Sully from West Palm Beach.  The home of E-Rock's family.  Is it just me or does Ant make his dad sound like Rocky?  No.  It's just you, stupid West Palm.  Yeah, so anytime I hear these songs, it kind of reminds me. 
[01:14:00]  I forgot what song was playing when the Buick overheated on her way to Flushing to visit friends.  And my father had to pull into a hospital parking lot to get water for the car.  And it was overheating.  And I was just crying hysterical because I was the biggest crybaby.  I would cry at everything.  I would cry at everything.  But I'm talking like I was six or seven.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I, too, was a crier growing up.  I was a crybaby.  I guess if there's any tough men out there that want to admit today they also were criers growing up, please call the program. 
[01:14:30]  Crybaby.  I was a big crybaby.  So because the car is going, you know, steam's pouring out of the front.  I'm in the back.  My father's just aggravated to be there.  So he turns around.  He's like, shut the F up.  And my mother's like, Joey, he's just scared.  Well, toughen up.  Like my father was convinced I would just be by like 15. 
[01:15:00]  Thank God.  Yeah.  But thank God, you know.  Yeah.  Thank God.  I didn't have to disappoint him like that before he died.  Thank God.  But I was always crying.  I was a big crybaby.  My mother would leave us like in the car to run in.  It's back in the old days.  You could do that.  Go in to the grocery store or something.  She'd leave me, my brother and my sister in the car with the windows rolled down like we were dogs.  But you did that.  And if somebody in the car next to us came up to get into their car, they would come up between and I'd see them coming close to our car and I'd go. 
[01:15:30]  Thinking they were going to.  Where at six or seven, this like fear and crying came from.  Because even my younger sister, my baby sister was fine with it.  I always thought we'd be kidnapped or something.  I was a little faggot.  I was five or six and I was going to my friend's house for the first time.  Like the first time I'm actually going to like a classmate's house to hang out after school. 
[01:16:00]  I think it was about five or six.  It was Jimmy Horowitz.  And I was, my mom dropped me off at Jimmy Horowitz's house, right?  It was, it couldn't have been more than two miles from the house.  By the time she got home, the phone was ringing off the hook.  She answered it and it was Mrs. Horowitz going, what's wrong with your kid?  Could you come pick up Greg?  And my mom's like, why?  Because he's crying hysterically. 
[01:16:30]  And she's like, but I just dropped him off.  I was too scared.  Yeah.  I was too scared to be left alone at Jimmy Horowitz's house and mom had to come pick me up.  The only time I cried, like, I'm disgusted with, I can't look.  Are you?  I'm disgusted with the two of you.  But we were children.  It doesn't matter.  Okay.  When I was a boy about that age.  Yeah.  My grandmother took me to Coney Island and she took me on the cyclone.  Oh.  And I was about nine years old.  Nine?  Crying.  All right.  Nine, you're a baby.  I was scared of the cyclone and I cried the entire time and wailed. 
[01:17:00]  And there was a black father with his son in the front of us.  Yeah.  Trying to comfort me.  Aw.  Shushed me up.  That's nice.  While I cried my little privileged white eyes out.  I wept like crazy on my first day of kindergarten.  I remember it vividly.  The car pulled up.  It was me and my mommy.  She took me to kindergarten and walked me to the door.  And the kindergarten teacher.  Now, I'm thinking, they don't do this with everybody.  So, my mother probably planned because she knew I was going to lose my mind. 
[01:17:30]  So, she had to do it this way.  She walked to the door and the kindergarten teacher took my hand.  And she goes, come on, Anthony.  We're going to go into a class and there's plenty of people to play with and everything.  And I was like, okay, this sounds great.  Because I assumed mommy was going to be there the whole time.  Well, mommy turns around to leave and I lost my mind.  I punched the kindergarten teacher and I'm running to the door and I can't reach that top thing that you push. 
[01:18:00]  You know, the bar that opens up school doors.  I couldn't reach it.  So, I'm just pounding on the glass going, mommy!  Mommy!  And she just had to keep her back turned and walk away.  And I'm sure she was crying herself.  She wasn't.  She had the douche chill.  What a little faggot.  Everyone was saying I was scared of Jews.  That's why I was crying.  Scared of Jews.  At the heart with the little blonde, perfect hair. 
[01:18:30]  Are you airy and walking in there?  Yeah, they should have been scared of me!  Right.  Mother, he has dark eyebrows!  It is him, Greg O'Beeuse!  It's the white devil!  Bert and Philly, he can't let you slide today, Anthony.  No one can.  Anthony, you did disappoint your father.  You were hanging around with Richard in the treehouse.  He had to know about the kid before you did.  That's true.  No, no, actually not.  I wouldn't have put him on to Richard being gay, to tell you the truth. 
[01:19:00]  Because he wasn't.  When I first moved out to California, you know, the kid was like 11.  And we were just friends.  And I don't know, something happened.  The gay switch flipped when he turned like 14.  Who's to know?  I didn't know.  I didn't know until, yeah.  Because we used to hang out at the stable.  I had horses and everything.  We'd hang out at the ranch.  I know it's a legendary story for the XM listeners, but there's a lot of people that are hearing us for the first time ever. 
[01:19:30]  Or the first time in four years.  Yeah.  And you're going to have to use the fake beep, but you've got to tell this story.  It's worth telling again.  Because, well, he's saying that my father should have been on to Richard.  Anthony almost had his own monster rain moment.  Well, I had a friend, Richard, out in California, and we used to do, you know, we were like best friends. 
[01:20:00]  We used to go horseback riding and stuff because we both had horses, fishing.  I remember waking up very early in San Juan Capistrano to ride our bikes to Dana Point with our fishing poles and go fishing and stuff and just doing things that kids did.  Did you ever see someone's bike and go, what the hell is that on yours?  And they said, oh, a seat.  No, it wasn't that obvious at that time.  See, I'm talking 11, 12, 13, that whole age was just filled with normal kid growing up things. 
[01:20:30]  At that point, you're just waiting for the hormones to take off.  Right, because you're still a kid.  You're all pretty much the same level.  You don't know if you're going to get the gay hormones at that point or the manly hormones.  Or the man hormones.  So, but there were, in hindsight, and I mean hindsight in the literal sense, not hindsight.  In hindsight, I kind of do recall, because even at a very young age, I'd be looking at girls and thinking, wow, she's cute.  Or I'd like to kiss her or something like that. 
[01:21:00]  And he was always disinterested.  And I'd never thought about it because I was a kid and everything.  You kind of don't think about those things.  But we used to just do things like you do with your best friend.  And then we started getting a little older, and we used to hang out and camp out at the stables.  We had our horses there, and you'd make a big fire and barbecue things and hang out.  And the girls would come over from the stable, too, because they had horses.  And we'd hang out and talk with them and try to make time with them or something like that. 
[01:21:30]  And, again, he was disinterested.  And then one time, I guess when he was about 14, I guess I was 15.  It was kind of right before I came back to New York to stay permanently, because I was out there for quite a few years with my father.  We were camping out in the treehouse.  It was this treehouse that we had built at the stable.  And we were just kind of talking about everything, and we decided to just go to sleep. 
[01:22:00]  So I'm laying there, and he kind of – like we were also drinking some beers at that point.  We started – when we had –  At what age?  Hung out at the stables drinking beers.  I was like 14.  Oh, 14.  All right.  14, so, yeah, we started, like, drinking some beers and stuff, drinking some Coors.  And so I start – you know, I'm going to sleep, and he leans over, and I hear him whisper, 
[01:22:30]  Anthony, you want me to suck your –  And I'm laying there, like – like I'm turned, where I'm facing the wall of the treehouse.  Where there are a few –  And he's kind of, like, behind me.  So I'm like – I'm like how Vito would be, and he's like Johnny Cakes.  And I guess he thought I didn't hear him because he repeated it. 
[01:23:00]  He's like, because I'll – if you want me to.  And all I could do is lay there with my eyes, like, wide open, but he didn't see that,  and try to control, like, my breathing and just go –  I faked sleep where there should have been – a celebrity should have come out 
[01:23:30]  and given me an Oscar for best sleeping performance done by a man with a homosexual trying to –  Did you sleep through the hole when he spit in his hand thing and broke back mountain you, your young – 
[01:24:00]  It was like broke back tree fort.  It really was.  Yeah, I made believe I was asleep.  And then the next day, like, nothing was acknowledged about it.  But there was, like, this uncomfortable thing where we hung out less and less, and that was that.  And then less than a year later, I was on a plane back to New York where I stayed, and that was it.  Went back to California years later with my friends, Joe Curry, the hillbilly that we had on the XM show, Frank, my brother. 
[01:24:30]  And we went out, and it was all about just grabbing guns and going hunting with my father and stuff.  It was very cool.  And Richard came up.  And now at this point, we're all in our 20s.  And he came up, and we asked him if he wanted to go hunting,  but he decided to go with my father's wife, Corey, to go curtain shopping.  And at this point, it was just blatant, man.  It was like, hi, how have you been? 
[01:25:00]  So good to see you.  It's like, oh, okay.  You want to, um, you're going hunting, but do you want to get some curtains?  Or maybe I can...  Your upbringing was like this boy's life.  Your father was trying to convince you that he fought for the pink team.  Yeah, yeah.  Fought for the pink team.  I had quite a few adventures growing up, especially out in California. 
[01:25:30]  It was like the Wild West.  And, uh, horses, guns.  I've seen people get shot.  It was just, uh...  It was a great time to grow up.  It was just wonderful.  All the sexual advances.  My formative years, homo advances.  One guy, because I guess I was, I was a cute kid.  I'll say.  And, um, one time there was this Mexican guy.  We were hanging out at, uh, one of these Mexicans, uh, uh, stables where they kept their horses. 
[01:26:00]  And this old, drunken Mexican guy starts talking to me.  And everyone else is around.  You know, we're right around this big fire, and my father's there and everything.  And this old, drunken Mexican guy's, like, talking to me.  And then he goes, you know, if you want, we can talk over there in the bushes if you want to, you know, talk a little more about things.  My father heard this, turned around, and I have never...  And I've seen my father kick some ass.  Never seen him kick someone's ass like this where the other Mexican guys had to pull him off. 
[01:26:30]  He'd have killed the guy.  And he's like, the guy's trying to ask my son, I'm gonna kick the guy, I'm gonna...  And how old were you?  Um, 19.  13.  Yeah.  This was just, uh, 20.  They're fighting, you just stood there by the fire and sipped your Shirley Temple.  Oh!  I sipped my chocolate, I sipped my chocolate martini.  Oh!  Oh!  Would you?  Want to go to the bushes?  Why is your son standing there in a pair of heels? 
[01:27:00]  He is egging me on.  You're about age 14.  Yeah, it was, uh...  There you go.  Quite the upbringing.  Irresistible, Anthony.  I was.  I was a doll.  Svelte.  All right, we're gonna say...  We're gonna step aside.  We got a lot of people calling in to admit that they, too, cried growing up.  We're looking for manly men who cried growing up.  Also, uh, speaking of the gay, did you cry growing up, Club Soda Kenny?  Club Soda is the biggest mooc ever.  No, thank you.  No, none of that, huh? 
[01:27:30]  No, I was a bully all my life.  You've never cried.  Why, you made people cry, right?  Yeah, I regret it now, because it's nice to be nice.  How would you know?  No, I try.  I make an effort, but I just have a propensity to make people dislike me.  It's amazing.  He has a knack for it.  My dad kind of made me stop the whole crying thing, also, when I lived out there.  Uh, because one time my leg cramped up, and I let out a scream, like it was, like that. 
[01:28:00]  And he, like, grabbed me by the, by the scruff of my neck and shirt and said, the only time  I want to hear you make a sound like that is if there's an effing arrow in your chest.  Oh, man, you're dead.  And that was it.  Your dad didn't tolerate anything, did he?  It was, he said, I, he constantly said I was in man training.  Like, man training.  And that entailed getting me a girl on my 13th birthday that was 19.  Like, it was just like this whole plan that he had.  He was so paranoid that one of you were going to turn out gay. 
[01:28:30]  Turn out with a little bit of the gay.  He was really paranoid.  He said, you're 13?  Get him a girl.  Let's get this going right away.  I don't want him thinking about joining the other team.  No crying when you're having sex.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're late.  We're very, very late today.  Yes.  Speaking of the gay, gay group sex party arrests in New Jersey.  Big story today.  McGreevy there.  An update on Fat Nick confessing or his confession tape.  We got that today.  We have newscaster improv that we were, what? 
[01:29:00]  We're taking a break?  Tom Chase, I'm just panicking.  We're doing great radio right now.  Tom, don't fire.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  The worst.  The Opie and Anthony.  I know.  What happened?  Apparently Jimmy's mic squeaked.  It hurt. 
[01:29:30]  Squeaky.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  We'll do a couple phone calls, then we'll move on to some other things.  It's Chris in New Jersey.  What's going on today, Chris?  Not that much.  Hey there, Chris.  Chris?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we hear you.  What you got?  Let me turn the music off.  Go.  Okay, yeah.  When I was like 13, the family went on vacation down in Wildwood, New Jersey.  And my dad took us to the amusement park and he wanted me to go on a roller coaster.  And my sisters have been riding all day. 
[01:30:00]  And I started crying like the biggest baby because I was scared to death of it.  And my mom said, no, he doesn't want to go on.  Don't make him go on.  My dad goes, no, there's no way.  He's 13 years old.  I've been playing football for three years at that point.  He says, you're getting on a damn roller coaster.  He may be getting in the front row.  And I cried like a little kid.  And there was like girls everywhere laughing at me and everything.  This girl's laughing at you.  He says, get on the ride, you fat pig.  I'm going to say, is he going to shoot me, dump my body in the river?  I don't want to get on the ride.  All these kids are there. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  I just remembered another crying story.  I was just a baby.  I was in school and there was a thing where.  Give me the Dionne Warwick CD.  No, this wasn't a family thing.  It was just this is complete faggery.  I was at school and it was a bring something from your nationality type food to school that day.  So everybody would bring something from their nationality.  And it was like a smorgasbord type atmosphere for a bunch of the kids to elementary school.  I think first grade, something like that. 
[01:31:00]  And my mother was so like rushed and could give her crap.  She she bought these things, these Italian like I don't even know what they were kind of cakey,  but they were rolled up into like chocolate balls that were lumpy and it looked like crap.  And it was in a box and I just kind of dumped it in a bowl and put it on the table.  And no one took any because the word got out that it looked like crap.  And and I was so disappointed that nobody took it, that I started crying in school. 
[01:31:30]  I'm sitting there in front of my bowl of Italian crap cookies, crying my eyes out.  What a girl.  Oh, such a.  I was such a little girl.  Just sitting there in front of your baked goods that nobody wanted.  No one wanted.  And I was.  Yeah, I was crying because no one wanted them.  When they said, what's wrong with you?  Did you just say nothing?  My period's coming.  I was emotional.  Yuck. 
[01:32:00]  Let's get a Rick in North Carolina.  How's my mic working?  Working fine.  Yes.  What's up, Rick?  Uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, well, uh, I stuck my thumb till I was 13, 14 years  old.  You sucked your thumb until you were 14?  Yeah.  Are you a man's man now?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a man's man now.  I, I was, uh, my parents got divorced when I was really young and I had a pretty hot step 
[01:32:30]  mom.  And anyway.  Yeah.  That has to do anything with you sucking your thumb till you're 14.  So what finally got you out of the thumb sucking to start torturing small animals?  Find something else to satisfy that, uh, urge, did you?  Uh, yeah.  Richard?  No, well, not that, not that way.  But no, I just, I don't know.  It was just one of those things, man.  I just, uh, you know, um, you know, 14.  Did you do it in secret?  Say again?  Did you do it in secret or were you there at, you know, junior high just sucking your  thumb or whatever? 
[01:33:00]  Stupid wet finger.  No, I did it in secret.  Big callous thumb.  Always look like you just get out of the shower.  Like, well, that thumb must be clean.  You're always watching it.  Worsh.  All right.  Thanks, uh, Rick.  Yep.  I don't think we'll take any more calls.  Nah.  For a while.  No one's going to top me as far as being a big baby anyway.  Yeah.  A little douche just sitting in front of a bowl of untouched cookies.  Crappy looking cookies crying.  Anthony's duty cookies.  Fact.  They just showed Hasselhoff crying.  Oh, they did. 
[01:33:30]  Speaking of crying.  Crying.  Yeah.  Well, he's David Hasselhoff.  At least we're not crying at American Idol.  Well, I did get a little emotional last night.  Oh, my God.  That is great.  David Hasselhoff crying at Taylor Hicks 1.  All right.  Here we go.  We got a very interesting story out of New Jersey.  Listen to this.  This next story tonight comes with a warning.  You are about to see exclusive video of men engaging in sexual activity in a public park.  Now, this park is popular with families and also popular with gays cruising and then hooking up. 
[01:34:00]  It's the South Mountain Reservation in Maplewood.  Let me write that down.  New Jersey reporter Anthony Johnson takes us there.  Ooh.  Does he?  These men are involved in all kinds of sexual activity.  Twosomes, threesomes, and foursomes.  Ooh.  We have altered this amateur videotape to hide their identities and the sexual activity.  Why?  But it's the kind of thing you don't expect to see in a public park filled with trails where children and families hike 
[01:34:30]  and can easily stumble across some very graphic sexual activity involving men apparently not ashamed of their public display.  It's pretty upsetting because, you know, I walk my dog in a lot of these reservations here, so I don't really want to run into something like that.  Run into it.  Oops.  Sorry.  Wow.  Wow.  Just trying to pick juniper berries.  Say, what's going on behind that shrub?  Club Soda County ran into a microphone. 
[01:35:00]  Were you caught at this park?  Yeah, Kenny would.  Why are you so excited to be on Mike?  No, in my past life, my alter ego.  Yes.  I used to work in that park near that jurisdiction.  You did.  And one time I had to go on the detail to catch those type of people.  Yeah.  And the thing was, the signal was, they used to jingle their keys at each other.  Oh, is that it?  And that was the signal.  Yeah, to hook up.  Wow.  You were like a boy toy decoy? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, were you a decoy decoy?  Did you jingle your keys and then just haul off of the right?  That explains the mustache.  No, I'm kidding.  We finally understand the mustache.  Kenny, you're not undercover anymore.  You can shave that.  You can shave the gay mustache off.  There'd be a bunch of empty cars and there was like 30 people lined up outside of Kenny's truck.  Those people, they used to like to fight because they were like all professional people, like doctors, lawyers, married with kids.  Yeah.  And they couldn't get caught being, you know, doing what they were doing. 
[01:36:00]  So they needed a big moose like you to get in there if they wanted to resist.  So were you a decoy?  Yeah.  And people used to jingle.  So what would happen when you were jiggling?  Hi, fella.  Give us a little something.  Well, it's too graphic and I don't want to get in trouble because, you know, I'll say the wrong thing.  Well, you had to make sure they were there for that, right?  Right.  So did you have to, was there some kind of an offer made to you or?  Yeah, there has to be some kind of overt act.  Overt act.  Right.  So would they actually have to disrobe to a point or? 
[01:36:30]  Well, they would have to do something, make a gesture, touch, talk.  Touch.  So you would actually be touched?  Oh, no.  No.  I would never participate in the overt act.  Oh, so you would be watching two other guys?  Uh, perhaps sometimes there would be that activity.  Well, what if a guy comes up to you?  Let's say, jingle your keys.  Hey, fella.  Nice mustache. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks.  How are you doing, pal?  Uh, good.  Uh, now what would I have to do, like, to you that you would then, uh, have to do your job?  No, I, like, for instance, I would start complimenting, like, uh, ooh, that's a lovely color shirt you're wearing.  Why, thank you, sir.  You know, just trying to, like, pick the guy up.  Yeah, let him know you're interested.  Right, right.  It's going well so far.  Yeah, no kidding.  Smooth.  We all know Kenny's a horrific actor.  Oh.  Nice shirt.  You caught no one.  Let's be honest. 
[01:37:30]  Well, no, see, that, you were like, uh, like the, they would come on to you with no problem.  Right.  So what would he do?  Like, where is the point where you then let on who you are and what your job is?  Like, what did he have to do if, if you weren't the one being touched?  No, because they, they, they would like, uh.  He'd say.  You want to take a walk?  You want to go to the car?  You want to listen?  You know.  And that's enough?  No.  No, no, no.  No, but then, you know, once if they tried to put their arm around you. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, so, yeah.  So you would be touched in certain ways sometimes.  Oh, no, I wouldn't let nobody touch me.  Then how would you?  So you weren't arresting anyone.  Oh, no.  If, if, if they raised their arm to put it around me.  Stop it.  That was enough.  That was enough for me.  No, the guy went to pat you in the back and all of a sudden he's in cuffs.  I don't believe it.  I don't either.  I think Ken would do the thing where they would go, you're not a cop, are you?  And he would take it out.  And, uh, he'd go, no, I'm not at all.  And they would make eye contact for a little while.  Right.  Ken would let it happen for a good 10, 12 minutes and then bust him. 
[01:38:30]  No, it was very easy because those people were very eager.  Right.  And more often than not, you would catch other people in the act.  How many times did they, did they like reach into your truck and go, my God, you're 6'5 and  this is what you have?  I can't find it.  No, I would tell them I'm.  His key is bigger.  I'm 6'5 and, I'm 6'5 and everything's in proportion.  Oh.  Oh, there you go.  Well, fella.  Really?  It was a smooth talk like that.  Nice shirt.  That's a good color for you. 
[01:39:00]  All right, well.  It brings out your eyes.  Let's, don't.  Let's play the next clip from this story.  Arrows have been painted on trees showing these men where to go so they could meet.  Wait, they had arrows and everything?  They didn't have, I told you they're very blatant.  They didn't have arrows back in the day, but.  Not back in the day.  You know, there was a certain section and that was the, the, the signal was the jingle  of your keys at each other.  What would, what would the, what would the arrow say?  This way to weight loss. 
[01:39:30]  Arrows have been painted on trees.  No T-cells allowed past this point.  So they could meet.  They apparently follow the trail near the entrance to the South Mountain Reservation, hoping they  can join in.  Authorities say this public sexual activity is a growing problem.  I mean, today is just so prevalent.  There's so much more of it.  They're communicating with each other on the internet and, and showing photos of themselves  on the internet.  Come and see me.  This is what you can get.  The Essex County Sheriff's Office has made 87 arrests in this area this year alone. 
[01:40:00]  But I also believe there should be more of a public outcry.  It's crazy.  It's absolutely very frustrating for us, for, for our police officers and for the public.  It's not right for children.  Children should not be subjected to something like that.  The children.  They always got to ask how it's going to affect the children.  Oh, my God.  The, the, the freaking instant feedback is great.  Holy cow.  Club Soda Kenny.  Gay vice.  From Waterford. 
[01:40:30]  Another guy's calling him homo undercover.  Steven from Bayshore.  You know, we're doing the first half of the show, uh, trying to keep it, uh, keep it a little  cleaner.  So we have to, you got to use your imagination here.  Kenny would say, fee, fi, fo, fum.  I got a mustache now.  Make me.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Brian from Manhattan.  The signal was a foot tap in each bathroom stall.  I was also a decoy.  Oh, they're talking about something else.  Is CBS coming out with CSI key jinglers? 
[01:41:00]  Uh.  The problem with Kenny was that he couldn't get a lot because Kenny didn't like to go into  anything hardcore.  He just liked to make out.  Right.  Stay away from the, stay away from that truck.  He just likes to make out and have a lot of body contact.  Um.  Steven from Bayshore.  Kenny would ask the guys if they.  I'm lonely.  Steven from Bayshore.  Kenny would ask the guys if they wanted to climb his beanstalk.  Chris from Boston.  Here in Boston, the gays hang out in the mall bathrooms and the signal is to tap your feet  outside the stall while another fella waits inside.  They are known to the mall police as tappers. 
[01:41:30]  Tappers?  Yeah.  Well, there's also the old shopping bag ploy that men sometimes use, uh, in, uh, stalls  where you take a shopping bag and, uh, put it down in front of you.  And if, if somebody is investigating and they look under the stall, all they'll see is you  sitting on the toilet like you're using it.  And since you've been shopping, perhaps there's a shopping bag in front of you.  And meanwhile, there's somebody standing in the shopping bag, uh, being serviced. 
[01:42:00]  And, uh, you know, you, you never know, uh, that, that it was going on.  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  Jimmy's favorite famous crinkle, crinkle.  Yeah.  It's just a pair of confused feet.  Just a lad who is whining his business.  And someone said, come here, there's candy in this stall.  They end up with their feet in a bag.  And the next thing you know, you're just turning to and fro with a tear stained face.  And all you can hear is, and the crinkle, crinkle.  Dan in, uh, Pennsylvania, it sounds like a theme park. 
[01:42:30]  Your T-cell count must be this low to, uh, to ride.  They can always catch guys who used clear bags by accident.  Well, unless he just bought a pair of backwards feet, he's going to the pokey.  We got one more clip here.  On this tape, it appears that other men move in, apparently trying to join the action.  The men taken into custody are usually charged with lewdness, which is considered to be a minor offense.  But authorities are thinking about putting cameras up in this area to eliminate some of this unwanted activity. 
[01:43:00]  Record the hotness.  I wish I could say I'm shocked, you know, but I'm not shocked.  I'm not shocked.  Don't say you are.  Now, all of the men that you saw in that video appear to be having consensual sex.  Now, according to authorities, they come from all walks of life.  All ethnic groups, shocking groups, are married.  And also in the video, we saw that most of them were having unprotected sex.  Sheriff may not be shocked, but we're shocked. 
[01:43:30]  We're completely shocked.  The sheriff knows about the situation there.  He's been over there.  His men have worked the area, but these people continue to come back.  Who are these people?  That was Steve?  What?  Not our Steve.  Oh.  I thought it all ended with you outing Steve and saying that was all about Steve.  I hear someone getting your answer.  I'm just here doing homework for a radio show.  I'm a bear.  I live in the woods.  I'm just trying to get some sound bites.  Damn these hybrid car keys. 
[01:44:00]  They don't jingle very well.  You guys just push the horn button.  You're going to get us all busted.  I don't know what happened.  It won't turn off.  It looks like Than has a story.  Than?  Oh.  What?  No.  It's not Steve.  The Steve you're thinking of.  Oh, okay.  That's all I have.  Oh.  I had a whole thing if it was, but forget it.  All right.  I bet if Travis went undercover, they'd just call that kid the Magnet.  Got more busts in a week than we have in five years.  What is it about him?  You put him in those little white spandex shorts and word gets out. 
[01:44:30]  We got a guy from Utah this week.  Little Travis.  James Gump from Pal Talk was Kenny's line.  Can I kiss you on the mouth or do you want to kiss me?  You want to kiss me on the mouth?  I'm an idiot.  All right.  We should take a break because Keith the cop is here and there's some great calls coming.  And maybe we'll do some phone calls after the break.  Was there a guy, I heard they busted a guy with a van and a cast on his arm trying to  get guys to help him with a couch.  Is that true? 
[01:45:00]  Would you?  Could you help me?  Keith the cop.  I'll help you.  Would you?  Kenny beats him with the couch.  No, he actually lets Kenny go.  Like I just, it's not worth it.  You about an IQ 14?  All right.  We got a break.  It rubs a lotion in his mustache.  It does this whenever it's told.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  9, 2, 3, K-Rock. 
[01:45:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Rich Voss.  You might recognize me if you were on the train today.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  If you're on hold, stay there, but we got to go right to the hotline.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Who, me?  Yeah.  Mr. Lee.  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah.  Escorts and hookers and stuff.  You, I have to assume you've done that a couple of times at least. 
[01:46:00]  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah.  See, that's just it.  You go out.  You pick up some chick.  He's a rock star and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Yeah, everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape.  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today because I've always wanted to thank you.  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while  mom and sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey. 
[01:46:30]  We all went upstairs to see you rail, Pam.  You perverts.  You perverts.  You know something, though?  You're lucky.  You're lucky that you were endowed like that because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog.  And you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd be going  through life embarrassed.  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got to be psyched at that gun out there. 
[01:47:00]  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  If I got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I've got to ask you.  I saw Pam on, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN?  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even talking about the P word?  Because she was claiming.  I got to go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a f***.  What a dick. 
[01:47:30]  All right, Tommy Lee, officially an ass wipe.  Why would he hang up?  Why would he hang up?  You were tooling, are you idiot?  Hey, it got out of video.  You were married.  No one doesn't know.  Why are we bringing up the P word?  He wants to promote some golf tournament.  Wow, that's exciting, radio.  Let's talk about a golf tournament.  Want to talk about her and her goddamn hep?  And the fact that she says Tommy gave it to him?  What gave it to her?  What is wrong with these people? 
[01:48:00]  Did Tommy Lee lose his mind?  I didn't see if you were being nasty.  Did he lose his friggin' mind?  He wasn't even happy that we brought up the sex tape.  I was complimenting the guy.  I got to go.  Then go.  Go F yourself.  Have a sense of humor.  You jack off.  Like, anyone wants to hear about anything else that you're doing.  You're not exactly at the peak of your music career right now.  We want to talk about the sex you had.  We want to talk about the hep C.  The hep thing, Pam.  Does she have a big C?  The interesting stuff. 
[01:48:30]  Want to ask why he didn't have a lifeguard at the party?  Why are we going to sit there and plug stuff and not get something that would be worthwhile for this program?  Like, talk about Pam.  He should have used his schlong to separate the shallow end from the deep end of the pool.  Like that thing they put across the pool.  Oh, my God.  I'm glad this happened today.  It's a perfect example why.  Because a lot of people ask us, a lot of journalists ask us, a lot of listeners, why you guys don't have more famous people on the show. 
[01:49:00]  That's why.  That's why.  They all have major attitudes.  And they got an agenda.  Well, yeah, they could come on your show, but they will only talk about a stupid golf tournament.  And nobody was being a dick to them.  Like, you weren't saying anything messed up about Pam Anderson or him.  I just wanted to talk about Pam.  And I saw her on Larry King, and I wanted to comment on the hepatitis thing.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Obviously, you're not going to rescue children, are you?  Well, he was being a dick. 
[01:49:30]  He was just a dick.  That's not cool rocker.  Hey, here's my crib.  Hey, here's where my dogs hang out.  Yeah, my dog.  That wasn't cool rocker.  That was uptight asswipe that doesn't want to talk about anything that anyone wants to hear about.  He wants to plug stuff and get off.  Well, it don't work that way on this show.  It does not work that way.  Give and take, it's called.  We used to play that game, and we gave our listeners horrible radio.  Horrible effing radio. 
[01:50:00]  Nothing more.  Hey, why are we bringing up the P word?  No more.  Oh, God, disgust me.  Another rock hero gone.  Gone.  Is it?  Ugh.  Tommy Lee, been through the mill, been at the top of the frigging rock heap, back down on the downside of the slide,  and you'd think he'd have something to talk about.  There's only been books written about their sex lives and the debauchery that the crew's been through. 
[01:50:30]  It's known, Tommy.  You went out with Pam.  You were married to the woman.  You had kids with her.  What is it, a secret?  That's all in the book.  All of a sudden, we can't talk about, we can't talk about Pam Anderson.  These celebrities are delusional.  They are effing delusional.  Why do you think you're coming on a radio show to talk about a stupid golf tournament?  There are golf tournaments every day, these celebrity golf tournaments.  And if he would have talked with us, we'd have plugged it like we gave a flying F, too.  We would have given it a good plug. 
[01:51:00]  It would have sounded sincere.  Boy, what a surprise we bring up Pam when she was on Larry King last night.  Last night.  It wasn't like it happened two months ago.  She was blaming you for the hep.  I'd like to go to the horse's mouth and hear the answer, but instead we got the horse's ass.  Tommy Lee.  Wow, Tommy, you're real brave.  What a rocker.  When he said, I'm out of here, I thought...  What a rocker.  Suck it.  I thought he was kidding.  When he said, I'm out of here.  I thought he was kidding. 
[01:51:30]  So did I.  I thought he was kidding.  Oh, yeah, Vince and Nicky, much cooler.  When they hung out, they were talking.  They were talking about the past and their sex lives and everything.  They talked for like two and a half hours.  We asked...  They answered every single question we threw at them.  Every single one.  Talked about Nicky getting thrown into a dumpster because they thought he was dead after he OD'd.  He told the whole story.  Yeah.  I think it was in Japan or something. 
[01:52:00]  He OD'd.  And the people that were doing the drugs with him were like,  Holy S, we just killed a rock star.  We got to get rid of him.  Threw him in a dumpster.  All the sex stories.  And also, he woke up.  You got to mention the tape, though.  You have to.  It's a very famous porno.  You have to.  The tape is famous.  He might be tired of talking about it, but you know something?  People still want to hear from him about it.  It's part of doing what you do, Tommy.  It's part of getting your plugs out.  You got to give a little something first.  I'm not going to sit here. 
[01:52:30]  We're not going to sit here and kiss your ass.  Wow.  Dave is delusional.  Line seven.  I disagree.  What if Ant was on a show and they talked about his wife?  I talk about it all the time, you idiot.  Right here on this radio show.  And she wasn't on Larry King.  You know what?  Right.  If you were.  All right.  Let's say.  Wow.  You were lucky enough to be on Larry King, let's say.  Right.  You're going there.  You got to think.  Well, some questions are going to come up.  That might be a little uncomfortable, right?  Right.  Right.  If my wife was accusing me of giving her HEP. 
[01:53:00]  Ex-wife.  Ex-wife.  I would absolutely talk about it.  And Ant wasn't married to another celebrity who was being interviewed on national television.  Yeah.  Well, it's still.  And I've talked about it plenty of times on this show.  Going into a situation like that, you're prepared.  You know they're going to be asking questions.  Every time we sit down to do an interview with one of these magazines or a paper or something  or a Bill O'Reilly, we know some of the questions are going to be a little uncomfortable.  I know those Olsen twins questions are coming.  I'll answer them.  So you decide, all right, do I want to put myself through this? 
[01:53:30]  Or not.  I talked about the goddamn $300 engagement ring.  I talked about the hell night that was my wedding.  Call him back.  Call him back.  Or the publicist.  Call him back.  If I had a good chance to clear my name and go, no, that's not true, that's not true,  I would certainly do it.  I don't understand why somebody would want to do that.  We got more out of Pantera, Phil, and he was inebriated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's a rock star.  Phil. 
[01:54:00]  Get him back on the phone.  I'm so sick.  I need answers now.  I really am sick of these fake rock stars, by the way.  I'm tired of it.  I won't bring up names, but I've seen some things like backstage.  They're just fake.  They're not like, you know, I'll hand it to Norton, you know, with the dedication to Ozzy  and stuff.  When you're looking at Ozzy, you know he's not fake.  You know he's the real deal.  You know, there's a lot of bands just putting on the suit, Anthony.  That's it.  Putting on the look.  Yeah.  Oh, MTV Cribs is over. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, here's where I hang with my chicks.  He had chicks dancing on the poles like, oh, wow, look, he's Tommy Lee.  The strippers are there.  Everything.  It's crap.  Big rock star.  Yeah, where are my dogs?  Stop it.  Whatever.  There it is.  See if he gets on the line and just bust that trash.  Ugh.  God, I'm tired of it.  See you later. 
[01:55:00]  Bye.  I gotta go.  Why are we...  The P word.  The P word.  The P word.  She's got a name.  Her name's Pam.  You were married to the P word.  I think you'd want to maybe address the fact that she was accusing you of giving her the  HEP.  Do you have the HEP?  Yeah, that phone line just went dark.  That ain't happening.  Tell him not to talk.  No more not talking about stuff.  You know something? 
[01:55:30]  Fine.  After we clear some other stuff out of the way.  He can talk about what he's doing.  It's give and take.  No one wants to hear about Tommy Lee's music.  Being in the public eye, it's a price you pay.  I mean, I know it's annoying to have your personal life, but you know what?  When you're making millions of dollars and your personal life is a part of that, well, you  gotta talk about it.  You know something else?  If I sat down and Tommy Lee was somewhere and I got to speak with him, I would not bring  up things like this.  But this is a program that people listen to based on if they're going to hear interesting 
[01:56:00]  banter.  Tommy talking about his latest album and who's on it and what he's doing.  What could he possibly say to make people go out and buy it?  That's the give me that we give him after he gives us something.  It's a give and take.  You know, and you get on the radio and you talk honestly and stuff, you might turn some  people around and go, hey, that Tommy Lee's an interesting guy.  Oh, he's got a new CD out?  I'm going to check it out.  What the hell?  Now he looks like a jackass.  And you look at Ozzy, and I'm not even being a nut with this, talks about, no, no, seriously,  he talks about the time he tried to strangle his wife or the things he did.  Oh, he's very open. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Real open about all the good stuff and the awful stuff.  Yeah, real rock star.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm here in my lounge.  Look at my lounge, man, where my dogs hang out.  All my dogs.  I got a Starbucks right here in my house.  Anytime any of my dogs over and need the Starbucks, we...  Ooh, real cool rock star.  The P word.  And he hangs up.  Where was the Starbucks the day of the party?  Might have kept a few people awake.  Yeah, maybe the machine was getting cleaned that day. 
[01:57:00]  I don't know.  Well, that's it.  I don't care if he called back.  It's called Never a Dull Moment.  It's on.  And in parentheses, unless you're on the radio.  Pussy, your ex was on Larry King.  Yeah.  A show that the entire world was watching.  What a big dick.  Accusing you of some serious things.  And he's a jackass, too.  And this isn't a small radio show anymore. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, isn't it?  No.  Oh, I wouldn't have started yelling like that if I thought it was.  Oh, I better be quiet.  You had an opportunity to comment.  It happened last night.  Yeah.  Not even 24 hours ago.  Sorry.  You're going to be saddled with her in radio conversations and TV for a while.  It's the nature of the beast.  I'd rather, if he wants to pop on and address why he's very uptight and can't take some questions 
[01:58:00]  about his ex-wife.  Who is Pam Anderson?  You know?  I mean, stop it.  We've played the game way too long.  Yeah.  We've had publicists F with this program.  We've had people walk off.  And it's just not happening anymore.  We didn't even get any tough questions out.  We didn't say anything.  Anything.  Stop it. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Jesus.  God, that bugs me because, you know, you just think Tommy Lee.  Yeah, he'd be cool about it.  Nobody would make a dick to him.  Yeah.  And I could tell right off the bat.  We're like, all right.  Boy, he's got total lack of any energy.  He's really not adding to the hooker.  Because we were talking about the hooker thing.  I was like, yeah, all right, Tommy.  You've been to some.  Maybe he's got a story.  Maybe something. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Nothing.  So I figure I'm changing directions here.  Let's go for something he does have comments on or stories on.  We'll talk about the videotape a little.  And Pam.  There you go.  Shut up.  I was complimenting him.  That was entertainment.  I know.  For our Thanksgiving.  Jesus, what an ass.  Oh, that bugs me.  I hate that.  Muttley crew.  Can't believe it.  Hung up.  Tommy Lee. 
[01:59:30]  Tainted blood.  Hepatitis.  Doesn't want to talk about it.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  Sounded like the biggest pussy by saying that, too.  Oh, the P-word.  The P-word.  She's talking about you, pally.  Well, we'll step aside, Ant.  All right.  No surprise there.  No.  Oh, no.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3.  Good rock.  Hey, this is Geraldo Rivera, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  Let's go to Luke.  Hey, Luke.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I'm not trying to tell you how to run your show.  I'm not trying to break your sacks or anything.  All right.  Do you think you're being a little hard on Tommy, though?  I mean, the guy's going, you know, he's going through something.  His ex-wife's accusing him of giving her FC.  Maybe he's just trying to be above it and just not comment on it.  Hey, Luke, you're missing the point.  Then don't do an interview.  Right.  Then stop with the interviews.  Then don't do a nationally syndicated show.  You know what? 
[02:00:30]  Every interviewer out there that has the balls will ask him.  No one cares about the album and the tour.  The biggest thing they care about is all these accusations that Pam's making  and FHM Magazine on Larry King last night.  That's what they want to know.  It's not like you guys are paparazzi and you chased him down.  No.  He came here and said, look, I want to plug this.  He called us.  He's plugging his album.  He came right to our stoop.  Of course we're going to ask.  That's our job to ask.  I agree with you guys in a way. 
[02:01:00]  I know you guys are friends.  And the listeners expect it.  Absolutely.  Tommy Lee's on our show and we're going to make believe we care about his album.  I haven't even checked it out.  I don't think many people have checked it out, to be honest with you.  But I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and listened to what he had to say about it.  But there's other things we need to get accomplished, too.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But I kind of feel bad for him.  I think he's just trying to be...  And don't call a high-profile radio show.  You know what?  You guys are right.  Maybe some little rock station in Des Moines, Iowa doesn't have the balls to ask some questions. 
[02:01:30]  Because when you're with Pam Anderson, you're going to get the recognition.  Like, wow, you're with Pam Anderson.  And he never said, no, I don't want to talk about that.  It's like, it's always cool to be with Pam Anderson when you're married to him.  Well, when things go wrong, you've still got to talk about it like you did when you were married.  All right, look.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, sweetie.  What happened to our rock stars?  I don't know.  I'm so delusioned.  There's no real rock stars out there anymore.  Yeah, there's a few, but... 
[02:02:00]  Not really.  They're not living the real rock star lifestyle.  I'm talking about the new...  Phil from Pantera?  I'm talking about the...  Not a lot, but in general?  That guy is living the rock star lifestyle for 20 people.  You think Creed is living the rock star lifestyle?  No.  You mean up and coming?  That's what I'm saying.  The new guys.  The new guys.  And someone like Phil has been around for a very long time.  I'm talking about the guys that have come along in the last, let's say, five years.  You know?  Yeah.  AIDS is a big one, though.  Don't forget, man.  A lot of people just can't go out and bang like they used to be. 
[02:02:30]  No, I'm not even talking about AIDS and stuff.  I'm talking about how they surround themselves with people that tell them, well, you know,  it wouldn't be good to do this or say this on the radio.  Let's just focus on this.  They listen to the people around them instead of just letting it hang out like the old days.  Yeah, Phil from Pantera.  He didn't have any publicists around or anything.  He said some crazy stuff.  It would have given publicists nightmares.  When the publicists are there standing around, waving their hands.  Protecting their, quote, rock star image. 
[02:03:00]  Doing that finger to the throat thing like, cut, this is enough.  We're done.  We're done here.  Go away.  Go away.  Tommy Lee.  Oh, man.  What a big downer.  You know, you remember him as being the rock star from Motley Crue and he's banging the  models and stuff.  He turns out to be just another ass.  Hey, Tommy, you want to jumpstart your career? 
[02:03:30]  Start talking.  Talk.  Start talking.  That's what does it.  Guess what?  Your name will be in the papers again.  It's a known formula that works.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, why you guys call me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up, like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything and  you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to, you were, you were told not to bring up the people.  No one, no one told us anything. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, Tommy, no one tells us what to do, first of all, and you were the big, no one tells us  what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name.  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, yes, you were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it instead of trying to talk your  way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not!  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's a...  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about.  You know what, guys? 
[02:04:30]  What year are you guys living in?  It's like, dude, turn the page, guys.  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  It was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this.  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying,  pretty much, that you gave her hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her a hep C.  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that? 
[02:05:00]  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King.  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  You know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well.  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to, you know, maybe talk  to you about it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  Why?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is.  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it. 
[02:05:30]  That's all.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what?  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and calling her a liar, a C, a d**k.  Every name I can figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused.  You didn't even say the first time you're on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we agreed 
[02:06:00]  to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that it never got to us that we couldn't talk about Pam.  Because you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Wow, we need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play.  I know, I'm hanging up.  Hey, you don't want to talk about it.  I'm very open-minded.  Let me tell you something.  If we started talking about it and he just told us what he told us there, look, this 
[02:06:30]  is what she's saying.  I don't like going in that direction.  To me, it's old news.  I'd rather just not really get into it.  It would have been like, all right, that's pretty much his side of it.  If he doesn't want to dwell on it.  And us being us, we might poke at it a little more and make a goof about it.  I'm sure Jim will say some tasteless thing into the mic about it.  But you know something?  He didn't.  He just hung up and it was like, what's he doing? 
[02:07:00]  You call me a pussy.  I'm hanging up.  Oh, boy.  Jersey Bob here says, if I type in pussy, he'll disconnect from the internet.  Wait a minute.  There you go, Jersey Bob.  You were told.  You were told.  I'm told?  Tommy, maybe you should do your research on Ant and I.  No one tells us what to do.  I don't like being told things.  Believe me.  You call.  I've been told enough.  You see the hesitation?  He's like, oh, my God.  He called me a pussy.  Now I've got to hang up.  Yeah, no one else told that.  All of a sudden, he goes, you call me a pussy. 
[02:07:30]  I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  And all of a sudden, I'm just looking and you know he was confused like, oh, ass.  Now I've got to hang up.  I called him out on it.  You should have told him I will not have an ultimatum put to me.  It was that delayed.  Oh, brother.  Oh, wow.  Now I've got to hang up and I really need to promote this new CD.  Now what do I do?  I guess I've got to hang up.  He's living in a bubble.  You know what I mean?  He says, what year are you living in?  That was three years ago.  No, it's still like Ope said. 
[02:08:00]  When you see her on Larry King the night before talking about it, you would think, all right,  for our side alone, just for this radio, it would be interesting to hear his rebuttal  on the whole thing.  So we're obligated to ask.  Even if his rebuttal is, I don't want to talk about it.  That's not how I do things.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Then we get into other things.  He's talking like this Larry King interview happened six months ago.  Yeah.  We talk about the Motley Crue days.  You were told.  Plenty of other things we're talking about. 
[02:08:30]  You were told.  Go after yourself.  Told.  E, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Ope?  Hey.  Ope, I want to congratulate you on your new balls.  Why are my new ones?  I don't know, man.  And I'm a little disappointed in you, man.  What?  And when he hung up the first time, you were digging into him, man.  Then he called back.  He said, the guy should have fired right at him, man.  Dude, listen to me on this.  First of all, it's the Opey and Anthony show, and I went.  That's all that is.  If I didn't go, I guarantee my pal here Ant was going. 
[02:09:00]  You know what makes good radio?  I beat him to the punch, because we were both to the point where we had it.  Hey, you know what makes good radio?  Two people not yelling over each other, especially when a third is on the phone.  What we identify and know what to do, when one person's speaking, the other person has  to back off, because you don't want to hear this.  Go ahead, Ope.  Just say anything.  Hey, Tommy, what the hell is it?  You know something?  You don't want to talk about anything.  It's like, August 10th.  It doesn't sound good.  August 10th.  Yeah, I mean, he's a hazard anyway. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  No, no one cares about it.  Goddamn Norton, man.  All righty, thanks.  You were told.  You were told not to call this program with those words.  He could have even said, pending litigation.  Perhaps that would have, you know, okay.  And use that one.  Pending litigation.  It worked well for you when I was trying to, because I had a job to do when you were  going through your mess.  Yeah.  I was prying you to see how far I could get you to go.  And on the air, I would say, because it's true, it was.  You know, pending litigation. 
[02:10:00]  Perhaps there's some kind of lawsuits being filed that he can't talk about.  I don't know.  Unless he tells us, you know, what do we know?  We're going to talk about it.  The guy doesn't understand that after Motley Crue, the biggest thing he's known for is  a porno movie with his ex-wife, Pamela.  That's the biggest goddamn thing.  Hey, here's some excitement.  Tommy Lee.  Never a dull moment.  The name of the new CD.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  You're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America, where we love to make fun of 
[02:10:30]  everything. </pre>
