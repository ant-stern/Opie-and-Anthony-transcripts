<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a comedic segment selling absurd items, including Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa rookie cards alongside a bizarre claim of selling "22-year-old virgins" as a package deal, referencing Don West. This transitioned into humorous role-playing scenarios, such as job interviews and McDonald's drive-thru interactions, featuring increasingly outlandish sales pitches.  The hosts then discussed a news story about a giant mosquito in Queens supposedly causing encephalitis, with much comedic mispronunciation and caller anecdotes, including one about a mosquito wearing a KKK shirt. They played a hilariously risky K-Dog audition tape deemed too inappropriate for their boss.  A substantial portion featured Orson Welles's profane and hilarious outtakes from commercial recordings, highlighting his temper and the hosts' discussion of analog versus digital recording techniques.

The show then moved to an interview with Rachel Wallace, owner of a cat, Twinkles, who survived being put in a dryer on high heat.  The interview was punctuated by crude language and sexual innuendo, focusing on the cat's injuries, Rachel's reaction, and her fundraising efforts for Twinkles' veterinary bills. Rachel also mentioned her job as a high school drug counselor and provided her email address for donations.  The hosts briefly promoted an upcoming contest involving mothers and InSync tickets.

A significant portion centered around an NSYNC ticket contest.  The hosts referenced a previous contest involving a mother and daughter submitting "queefing" sounds.  A caller, "Gay Marco," offered oral sex for the tickets despite his disgust.  A new contest was devised: a female listener would receive tickets and a meeting with Dice (musician) in exchange for oral sex from Marco. Kristen agreed to this proposition.  Marco eventually performed the act on Wendy, another caller, with an NSYNC song playing, visibly distressed. Wendy also received a Cancun trip.  Further discussion followed about Marco's experience, interspersed with a caller trying to convince his mother he's gay and an in-studio conversation with "Jamaican Mike," focusing on his experiences with women and Jamaican culture, with sexually suggestive comments and Jamaican patois.

The broadcast continued with listener calls and discussions about experiences in Jamaica, specifically concerning the perceived size of Jamaican men's genitals. Callers shared anecdotes about Jamaican women's infidelity, leading to a “What's in My Pants” game with a female caller, Becca, describing her thong while driving.  Numerous callers shared explicit stories about encounters with Jamaican men, emphasizing their genitalia size, including descriptions of a "hummer contest" and awkward situations. A call to a Nevada escort service resulted in humorous miscommunication and explicit details.  The segment included a yodeling soundbite and repeated use of the phrase "Excuse me while I whip this out." A caller's Tourette's Syndrome was mentioned.  A call to a sex toy store concluded this segment with significant miscommunication and laughter.  The show included multiple commercial breaks and a comedic bit with Jim Brewer.

[00:22:30]  jersey and uh we're taking over the world or at least jersey there were people that jumped out of  their windows oh yeah citizen kane of course he then did a ufo take out the mayor did you remember  where he said the ship landed in jersey grover's mill grover's mill very good that's right very  good there you go well um rick stumbled upon some orson wells outtakes yeah this is pretty damn funny 
[00:23:00]  you think casey was a tool is that don on the phone hi i'm casey casem a little dog named god damn how  the hell am i supposed to come out of an up-tempo number hi you know but this so here's orson wells he's  trying to do a commercial read obviously anthony yeah everyone's heard our outtakes uh here's orson  wells and his outtakes orson wells he just gets very ornery and he's talking to the guy in the 
[00:23:30]  control room that probably makes about four bucks an hour well back then probably like 75 cents oh my  god really probably made nothing while orson wells is making all that dough and he's just giving this  guy a hard time and it was 10 times harder because it was all tape and stuff no digital workstations to  just punch it in cut and paste is that the old razor blade trick where you cut out the and paste  it together oh yeah yeah that's how they did it i remember watching you do that man that was like  an art hope you used to do that at a bb all the time and it's like oh how much time left 20 seconds 
[00:24:00]  and you're still editing tape cutting out words on tape and then taping the two ends together that's  how they used to do it was a pain in the ass yeah so when orson wells screws up this read that means they  had to start over yep over and over and over can't just hit you know delete and then start over  again like they do on the computer work yeah i'll punch you in yeah punch you in the face here we go  here's orson wells and the killer voice nothing is more important than the simple act of getting  together you could have just one more take of that why i just did it right why the hell are you asking me 
[00:24:30]  for another one well i thought there was a slight gong and i would like just like to be safe jesus  i take directions from one person under protest but for two i don't sit still but who the hell are you  anyway this is a lot of you know that you want one more yes wow man i gotta hear the first part  again where he goes why i did it right the first time i think he screwed it up though yeah he did 
[00:25:00]  screw it up he slurred a word right yeah nothing is more important than the simple act of deep getting  together you could have just one more take of that why i just did it right i just did it right no you  didn't you slurred the word listen listen nothing is more important than the simple act of deep getting  together together you could have just one more take of that why i just did it right of getting  together getting people right yeah yeah see what i can get another the engineering screw it up or he 
[00:25:30]  screwed up all right let's go why i did it right i did it right martians in grover's mill what's happening  ray guns all right this next one man does anyone know what he's uh doing a read for with this one uh i think  it's like uh frozen peas or something frozen peas yeah i'm a whore frozen peas my bank account's a  little low he's talking about frozen peas and man he gets really picky with them i'm into my character 
[00:26:00]  and the thing is if if it sounds a little weird like you don't know why he's referring to well we're  over whatever like talking about what he's seeing it's because when they did these types of commercials  tv commercials they had to lay the voice after they shot the picture right so he could see what  he's he's uh right so they would show the the commercial commercial in front of him and as he  he saw it he would voice it and say the appropriate things in the appropriate place right and they  wanted the words to match the right picture right yes here's orson or no orson well we know a remote 
[00:26:30]  farm in lincolnshire where mrs buckley lives every july peas grow there do you really mean that  yeah so in other words i'd start half a second late don't you think you really want to say july  over the snow isn't that the fun of it it's if you can make it almost when that shot disappears it'll  make much i think it's so nice that that you see a snow-covered field and say every july peas grow there 
[00:27:00]  we know a remote farm in lincolnshire where mrs buckley lives every july peas grow there we aren't even in  the fields you see we're talking about him growing and she's picked him yeah oh my god that's about  as the the most the most funny orson wells we'll ever get yeah i think he just cracked the joke  he's trying to match the audio with the video he's talking about growing peas and on the screen she's already 
[00:27:30]  picked them but she's already picked them and then flying saucers come down pray god listen again  we're talking about him growing and she's picked them yeah on what in july i don't understand you  then when must what must be over for july uh when we get out of the snowy field when i was out we were  onto a can of peas a big dish of peas when i said in july oh i'm sorry yes always i'm always past that 
[00:28:00]  yes well that's about where i say in july you emphasize a bit in in july why that doesn't make  any sense sorry there's no known way of saying an english sentence in which you begin a sentence  within and emphasize it get me a jury and show me how you can say in july if you go down on you  that's just it wait what was yeah why did he say that what was the curse he said he said and i'll go 
[00:28:30]  down he said yeah i'll go down wow get me a jury go back a couple seconds in july  in july get me a jury and show me how you can say in july oh it didn't go down on you that's just  idiotic if you'll forgive me my sex that's just stupid in july i'd love to know how you emphasize  in and in july impossible meaningless i think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to 
[00:29:00]  he isn't thinking well listen tell me just to one last yeah and it was my fault i should i said  in july if you can leave every july you didn't say it he said it you're a friend every july  no you don't really mean every july it is but that's a bad copy it's in july of course it's every  july there's too much directing around here norway fish fingers no find us norway we know a certain 
[00:29:30]  fjord in norway near where the card gather in great shoals there yonster stangeland  a fraction more on the one that shows thing did you roll it around very nice yeah roll it around  and i have no more time you don't know what i'm up against because it's full of of of things that  are only correct because they're grammatical but they're tough on the year you see this is a very  wearying one it's unpleasant to read unrewarding what a prick man oh my god what a prick can you 
[00:30:00]  imagine being the guy that's got to run that tape the poor engineer well saying that to you yes what  are you talking about you incompetent the in the fjords yim vank yes the fjords there are flying  saucers little men green men ray gum what do you say in and emphasize in i'll bend you over and 
[00:30:30]  butt slam you if you could show me get me a jury your friends get me a jury and another scotch i was  hammered the complete 28 last years of my life there's more is that don on the phone where are those  pictures i was supposed to see how am i supposed to go into a commercial about peas with flying saucers  landing what a dick here's some more because fingers freeze the card at sea and then add a crumb crisp 
[00:31:00]  cool crumb crisp coating that's tough crumb crisp coating i think no because of the way it's written  you need to break it up because it's not it's not as conversationally written what take crumb out  good here under protest is beef burgers we know a little place in the american far west 
[00:31:30]  where charlie briggs chops up the finest prairie fed beef and tastes this is a lot of  you want one more you missed the first beef actually completely you're emphasizing prairie fed  but you can't emphasize beef that's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before july come on  fellas you're losing your heads i wouldn't direct any living actor like this in shakespeare where you do  this is impossible awesome you did six last year and by far away the best and i know the reason the 
[00:32:00]  right reading for this is the one i'm giving it at the moment i spend 20 times more for you people  than any other commercial i've ever made you're such pissed now what is it you want in your depths of  your ignorance what is it you want whatever it is you want i can't deliver because i just don't see it  that was absolutely fine it was no money is worthless wow he left he walked

He had a tuxedo the size of a circus tent.  Let me tell you.  Hey, what was the movie  Orson Welles did  Evil in the title?  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil, yeah.  What an unbelievable movie that was.  It's pronounced Evil.  Touch of Evil.  I don't know if this guy just drank  gala wine to numb his brain, 
[00:36:00]  but I don't know how he fell so far.  Yeah, well, there you go.  Get a jury.  Get a jury.  Find out how.  If you find out how I fell so far,  I'll give you a Cleveland steamer.  All right, Arthur.  Complete with undigested green peas.  Green peas.  Every July.  Every July, I look in my toilet and see  corn and green peas.  Sometimes an errant strand of broccoli, Rob. 
[00:36:30]  After those Saturday nights with Dean Martin,  my bowl would look like  someone used a salad shooter in it.  My ass looks like  chopped up, well-fed beef.  Wonderful.  But I did it right.  But I did it right.  I'm getting here that all night long. 
[00:37:00]  I'm talking about.  But I did it right.  Pests.  I did it right the first time.  Don't have to take this.  There's the bowl.  Yes, and if we go to the orange groves  in this Southern California  orange orchard,  you'll see the two of these put together  look like my old sack.  Why can't I talk about my sack?  They look like the oranges.  What do you know?  Idaho russet potatoes. 
[00:37:30]  That's what my sack looks like.  Complete with eyes.  Wonderful.  Why does my ass look like  Yucca Flats after the blast?  After a weekend with  Dean Martin, Terry Lewis,  Bing and some peas.  One day we were all tanked up in Vegas  watching Sinatra  and I believed I saw 
[00:38:00]  a flying saucer  land and shoot ray guns.  I don't care if this isn't pertinent to the copy.  Wait, look.  I'll scratch my butt crack.  Look, it looks like Brie.  I'm ripping off playing.  Wonderful.  Disgusting fat Orson Welles,  the final years.  I was served no ass cheese  before a sigh.  God, I've got to take a dump, 
[00:38:30]  you insolent, limey bastard.  I will not take direction from you.  I do it under protest.  I've got to take a dump.  Opie, run a knife over my fat body.  It makes me hot.  No, no.  It's not right.  Please.  No, it's okay, man.  God damn,  my dump looked like  leftover beef wellington  with fine chopped beef  from a cow  I slammed over the head 
[00:39:00]  with a sledgehammer  to make these fine burgers.  Mr. Welles, what happened?  Appetizing, isn't it?  I rip its throat out  with my own teeth.  What happens if I find a jury?  Find a jury?  I'll give you the  I'll give you the wheelbarrow.  Roll me in flower,  look for the wet spot,  violate me.  Orson Welles.  Speaking of greens, 
[00:39:30]  toss my salad.  Just toss my salad.  Why?  I did it right the first time.  Yes.  Nothing I like  than crapping out  a heaping helping  of rice-a-roni,  the San Francisco treat.  Why is it  the San Francisco treat?  I thought that was a fag.  Oh, this show is S. 
[00:40:00]  Bravo.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour  by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by  and Quinty Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  All right, we've got a doctor  on the line  before we move on.  Lou the doctor,  what's going on?  Lou?  Lou, what's going on? 
[00:40:30]  Listen, I have a good idea  for tomorrow's show.  I want to come on  and do my juggling act.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, man,  we're moving on  from yesterday's show  and it wasn't even that bad,  so shut up.  Okay, have a good day.  All right, man.  All right.  Well, we could get  to this Haywood thing.  Now, what writer  fell for that gag?  Well, it's the Post.  It is the Post, right?  Yeah.  Neil Graves.  What a tool.  Probably the number one  fake name.  Yeah.  Right?  I think Michael Hunt.  Michael Hunt is up there. 
[00:41:00]  I can't even think of others.  Like, well,  Philip McCracken.  I was going to say  Phil McCracken.  Phil McCracken.  Who falls for Haywood, though?  I mean,  do you know anyone  named Haywood?  No.  No.  You're right.  They did an article  on these coffee cafe banks,  they're calling them.  Basically, you know,  we've seen the internet cafes  where you go  and you have a cup of coffee  and you surf a little bit,  blah, blah, blah. 
[00:41:30]  Now they're taking it  to the next level  and they're like bank cafes,  I guess they call.  So you get your coffee  and you can do online investing  and things like that.  Check your stocks,  get some advice,  on, you know,  where you should put  your money and stuff  and these places  are popping up  all over Manhattan.  So they did an article  in the Post today  and on page 45,  New York Pulse,  they do the story  with Neil Graves  and they interview people  that just happen  to be in the coffee shops  doing their banking  and having a cup of Joe, 
[00:42:00]  you know?  And,  God.  So here's a quote  from a guy.  If I didn't work  a block away,  I wouldn't go in.  People who want to trade  can do it from their laptop  or a handheld device.  Haywood Jablomi,  41,  a Manhattan real estate agent,  agreed.  This is a nice looking store,  but I don't see people  coming in here to trade,  he said.  Not the suits  who work up here.  No way.  So Haywood is quoted  in the Post today.  Haywood Jablomi.  Ja, 
[00:42:30]  Jablomi.  Jablomi.  Jablomi.  That guy must have  laughed his ass off,  not only saying it,  but then reading it  the next day.  Right.  Who falls for that gag?  Try to get a Michael Hunt  in there.  That's got to be  the best one.  But it's funny  when you see it in writing.  It's, yeah,  the Post page 45,  okay?  Haywood Jablomi.  We got the owner  of Twinkles on the phone.  Twinkles the cat.  Rick,  you're losing  your effing mind.  Twinkles the dryer cat.  Well, 
[00:43:00]  it was a pretty...  Hey,  could Rachel hear us?  Okay,  can you tell Rachel  we're going to be with her  in about 30 seconds?  Because we want to read  the story.  It's very,  very tragic  what happened  to her cat.  Okay,  she's off the line.  Did you see?  There you go.  What a crock of ass.  This was in the Post today,  right?  Yeah.  A tumble dry cat survives.  Twinkles the cat  was in a tumble dryer 
[00:43:30]  for 15 minutes  and the cat survived.  Made it through.  And Rick wants  to fly Twinkles in  so he can have  some kind of competition  where we can see  if we can get a cat  in the dryer  for more than 15 minutes.  Oh,  come on.  You can't do that.  How did Twinkles  end up in the dryer?  Twinkles is the luckiest  cat in the world  after being tumble dried  on high heat  for 15 minutes  and surviving.  High heat.  It's a miracle  he made it.  This cat has now 
[00:44:00]  used up about  eight and a half  of his nine lives.  Oh!  Twinkles owner  Rachel Wallace said,  Wallace of Chippewa Falls,  Wisconsin,  adopted the long-haired  feline five years ago  and quickly found  he was curious  about everything.  She had no idea  Twinkles had climbed  into the clothes dryer  to investigate  a new hiding place.  So when she remembered  a load of wet clothes  she'd left in the dryer  from the night before,  Wallace simply slammed  the door  and turned the heat up.  I put the dryer on high  and went to sweep up  in the kitchen.  About 15 minutes later 
[00:44:30]  I heard this huge  chunking noise  and went to check it out  she said.  It was horrifying.  Wallace and her husband  Greg brought the cat  outside and poured  cold water on him.  Cool him off.  As their three kids  washed in distress.  Then they rushed him  to the vet.  He was basically in shock.  It wasn't really  dissimilar to an auto accident  Dr. Wayne Griffin said.  Oh, he was all beat up.  Yeah, Twinkles sustained  badly burned ears  and fluid in his lungs.  Oh. 
[00:45:00]  And, oh, this sucks.  Griffin had to amputate  his badly mangled tail.  Oh, man.  He had to be fed  through a syringe  for four days  but is now on the road  to recovery  the vet said.  Animal experts said  it was a miracle  the family pet survived  considering the temperature  inside the dryer  reached up to 160 degrees.  Wow, that's superhuman.  I had told the kids  that Twinkles was going to die  but somehow he held on  and kept fighting  Wallace said.  The family said  Twinkles will definitely  never set foot  in the dryer again. 
[00:45:30]  He's purring once again  and staying way clear  of the laundry room  Wallace said.  Now that his tail  is only an inch long  we're thinking of  calling him  Stubby.  Ho, ho.  So, Rick,  what the hell  do you want us to do  with the owner  of this cat?  That must have been  some static cling  on a long-haired cat.  Big sock stuck to it.  Twinkles owner.  All right, let's  plunk Rachel down.  All right.  Rachel Wallace. 
[00:46:00]  Hello there.  Hi, Rachel.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show live in New York City.  How are you?  Great.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Your story made  the paper today.  Isn't that amazing?  Absolutely amazing.  We're pet lovers  here in New York.  We are here in Wisconsin too.  We just want to know  how's Twinkles doing?  Well, Twinkles is doing better.  He doesn't look like himself.  He doesn't have a tail anymore  and his ears are all burned  but he's with us.  So, he's hanging in there.  So, they didn't give us  much of the story  in the paper today.  Could you just give us  a little overview  of what happened? 
[00:46:30]  Sure.  It was on April 8th.  It was a Sunday afternoon  and I came home from church  and we ate our Sunday dinner  and thought I'd sweep  the kitchen floor  so I was doing that  and I thought,  you know,  I think I'll do some laundry  while I'm at it.  Oh, laundry.  Yeah.  I quickly went to laundry room  and there were some  leftover kind of wrinkled  towels and jeans  in the dryer  from the night before  so I just quickly  shut the door,  slammed the door  and cranked it up on high.  Oh, my goodness.  And the cute little  puss-puss was in there.  Well, you know,  unbeknownst to me.  So, I went back  to my sweep 
[00:47:00]  and I was doing  a complete job.  I was moving  furniture in the kitchen.  So, Rachel,  you were the irresponsible one  in this situation.  I was the irresponsible  pet owner.  Is that what you would say?  Yeah.  Responsible for the pet  no longer having a tail.  I'll take full ownership  for it.  Any guilt, Rachel?  Any guilt?  You're laughing.  It sounds like  something serious.  No, I can laugh now.  I can laugh now  and I've learned  that we should all,  all of us that have pets  should close the dryer door  at all times.  Rachel, we are  card-carrying members  of the People 
[00:47:30]  for Ethical Treatment  of Animals here  and when we heard the story,  we were horrified,  quite frankly.  I know.  And I don't think  you laugh.  Please don't turn me in.  I don't think you laughing  about this is...  No, no, I'm...  Rachel.  No, Rachel,  you're talking to  two big pussy lovers.  Okay.  I don't think laughing...  Why is she laughing at us?  I'll stop laughing.  Why are you laughing?  I told the story  about ten times today,  so you have to just  excuse me,  as well as the BBC.  I did an interview  with the BBC last night  of all things.  The English are fags.  There you go.  So what happened was  is that I was sweeping 
[00:48:00]  and I kept kind of hearing  this kind of...  It sounded like a zipper  on one of my kids' jackets  or something  and I kind of ignored it.  So time went on...  That was probably  Twinkle's teeth.  What?  And it was about,  oh, I don't know,  12, 13 minutes later  that the noise got so loud  that I thought,  what is that clunky noise?  And I opened the dryer  and I was horrified.  It was our cat  and the cat was...  You sound horrified  with all your laughing, Rachel.  There you go.  How am I doing?  And I was horrified.  The cat was, you know,  blood was coming out  of his ears,  his nose, his mouth. 
[00:48:30]  He was roasting.  I've learned now  that dryers get up  to about 160 degrees.  Dare I say...  And he was gasping for air.  Hey, Rachel,  I'm the host  of this radio show.  Dare I say  you had a bloody pussy  in the dryer.  Okay, I didn't say that.  You did.  But it was hot.  It was hot.  It was a cat  and it was bleeding,  of course, yes.  He was gasping for air  and I ran downstairs,  got my husband  and our three children  and I came up  and my husband  called the vet  and he said,  you stupid bitch.  So we brought it outside  and proceeded  to pour cold water 
[00:49:00]  over it.  We were pouring  cold water  down its throat.  I mean,  anything we could do.  And you felt  that was good  being a veterinarian?  Well, let me tell you,  at the moment,  I was, you know,  anything went.  Rachel,  I was interrupted.  I'm sorry.  They gave me  my big cup of coffee  so I could get  through this mess  on the radio show.  So you brought  the cat outside  and it was heated up.  It was heated up  and we cooled it down.  Oh, so you cooled  the pussy.  Well, then,  stop this now. 
[00:49:30]  Well, then what we did  is we told the kids  that the cat  was going to die.  So, of course,  we were all bawling.  Of course,  my husband wasn't bawling,  but we were all bawling.  And they were looking  at you like the  irresponsible bitch cat owner.  You did this, mom.  Right, right.  So the vet called back  and said,  I have an idea.  So we rushed it  in the family van  to the vet  and he gave it  a steroid shot,  a diuretic shot,  and some other  kind of shot.  And within about an hour,  Twinkle started  kind of looking like  he was going to  pull through.  And he did.  Fascinating story.  He pulled through  and for the next four days, 
[00:50:00]  I breakfast, lunch,  and dinner fed him  with a syringe.  Because, of course,  he couldn't move.  He couldn't walk.  He couldn't move.  Did the doctor  have to shave  your little pussy?  Oh, stop this now.  What?  I'm talking about the cat.  Now, the doctor did say...  I'm not the one  that threw him  in the dryer, Rachel.  You are.  All right.  I don't know  what you call him  in Wisconsin.  We call him pussies  here in New York.  Right.  Kitties here.  Kitties.  Kitties.  Kittens.  Cats.  So he didn't have  to shave down the pussy?  No, he didn't.  Right.  But he gave it a shot  and he survived. 
[00:50:30]  Dare we say?  Although his tail died,  became hard  and it died  and we had to have  it amputated.  So if you'd like  to make a donation  to the Twinkles Amputation Fund,  it was $220.  I think you should  pay for yourself.  Rachel, are you trying  to say that something  hard on your pussy  had to be amputated?  Okay.  Now I'm going to be silent.  I'm just asking.  You said that the tail  was hard  and it was on the pussy  and it had to be amputated,  right?  That is correct.  That's correct. 
[00:51:00]  And it left you  with a mangled pussy,  I dare say.  That's right.  Now Twinkles is okay?  Well, Twinkles,  you know,  his ears are like  burned off.  One of them,  I think one of them  is going to make it.  One of them is like  kind of curled up  like a potato chip  and it's kind of  ready to chip off  any day.  It's deformed  and probably is going  to lead a horrible  life of team.  It looks like a lynx now.  It looks because  there's no tail.  So you're suggesting  if people want a cat  that looks like a lynx,  you just throw him  in the dryer.  I didn't say that.  Well, you did it. 
[00:51:30]  You didn't have to say it.  Hey, Fred on Line 9  wants to know  if the lint catcher  in your dryer  was full of pussy hair.  Oh my goodness.  Good question.  No comment on that one.  Although I did put  a bounce sheet in it.  Oh, is that the joke  you're telling now  at your cat's expense?  There you go.  That's funny.  It smelled great.  That's a joke here.  Now, how many lives  do you think your pussy went through?  I think he used up  about eight and a half.  Eight and a half?  I think he used up  about eight and a half.  Half left.  Got a half of life left. 
[00:52:00]  I think put him in the washer  ought to take care of that.  Maybe.  Well, Rachel,  you and your pussy  are quite famous today  in New York City.  I guess, yeah.  And it looks like  you've got a lovely daughter.  I see...  Oh, she's great.  It looks like it's Sarah  with the pre-washed pussy.  It's saying it right there  in the paper today.  Yep.  How about that?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Does it say that?  It's Sarah with the pre-washed pussy.  Whoa, what happened?  Rachel?  Yes.  I'm still here.  I'm sort of afraid  to start talking again. 
[00:52:30]  Why?  This is how we do our show.  I'm the mother of three children.  You know.  You put them in the dryer?  They're in school,  so they're not hearing them.  My infant crawled  into the dryer.  But you kind of hurt  our feelings  because this is how  we do our radio show.  Oh, I'm teasing.  That's okay.  You guys are doing  a great job.  We're just trying to,  you know,  make it in radio.  I know.  And we thought  we'd have a little fun  with you and your pussy.  There you go.  And now I feel like  I, I don't know,  might have said  something bad. 
[00:53:00]  Well, this went hard.  You know,  I think you'd feel better  if you'd make a donation  to the Twinkles Recovery Fund.  Are you insane?  Are you really trying  to get money for Twinkles?  No, but this did  cost us quite a lot of money.  Well, you should pay for it  with your own stupidity.  Why should other people  have to pay for it?  I'm happy to pay  because this is  our beloved family pack.  We don't pay for pussy  around here.  He's worth this and more.  Rachel,  why are you making money  off your pussy?  I'm not making money.  What the hell?  Poor cat.  Unbelievable.  She's actually trying 
[00:53:30]  to turn a dime.  She was a ho-er.  And how the hell  do you make money  off a mangled pussy?  Right.  You're horrible.  You're a whole woman.  What kind of money  do you want for that cat?  Ah, yeah.  What kind of money?  Yeah, how much  are you trying to scrape off?  220 bucks.  If all of your listeners  maybe sent 50 cents  to the Twinkles Recovery Fund,  we could get this thing  paid for.  Hey, you wouldn't happen  to have an email address,  would you?  I do.  That would help  because all of our listeners  would wrap me  behind little Twinkles. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, they would.  I'll give it to you afterwards.  Well, this is your opportunity.  We have a few listeners.  It is in New York.  I mean, we're not,  we're in last place,  but, you know,  we're trying to do  good radio every day.  Yeah.  There's somebody  listening to this.  Yeah.  What's your email address, Rachel?  I don't know.  I think I lost it.  Oh, here it is.  You want money?  Yeah.  You know how many  pet lovers we have  listening to us?  Do you have some pet lovers?  How can they send me money  through my email address?  Well, they'll write you 
[00:54:30]  and ask you where  they can send you.  How about if they send it  to your radio station?  Rachel, let me tell you.  You give them the address  of your radio station.  Rachel, we don't have time  for that.  And I'll tell you why  we want your email address, okay?  You ask the question.  We want to make sure  you're safe.  We're not just going to  give out an address  on the air.  Right.  But see, if you give out  the email,  then people, you know,  write you,  and then you give them  the address?  I'll give it to you guys  afterwards.  And if you really want  to give it out,  you can give it out.  But I'll give it to you  guys afterwards.  All right.  I'm too scared. 
[00:55:00]  You know, I'm the mother  of three.  Three little children?  Three little precious  children.  Three children.  And a great husband.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what's Twinkles  doing today?  Twinkles is lounging  around the house.  I left this morning.  I had done an interview  in California.  You know, the amazing thing  is that his brain  is 100% there.  How do you not?  I mean, picture yourself  tumbling in a dry  from his 50 minutes  on high heat.  I mean, would your brain  be there?  You don't know.  And his brain is there.  You don't know  if the brain's there.  You're fried.  Well, he's back  to his old behaviors.  You're fried your pussy's brain. 
[00:55:30]  He's back to his old behaviors.  I hear you were just  trying to imitate  a stunt that you saw  on Jackass.  Is that true?  Because I wish  that show was off the air.  It's horrible.  No, I had no idea  the cat had crawled  in the dryer.  But you know,  I learned my lesson now.  I check my dryer  many times before I do  any kind of laundry.  I'm kind of paranoid  in the laundry room now.  Hey, do you have,  is your pussy fixed?  Yes, it is.  Oh.  Yeah, but he still  pretends like he's not fixed. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, it's a he?  You know, yeah, it's a he.  Did it burn anything off?  No, things are still working.  He's there.  That's horrible.  I know.  What a horrible story.  I know.  Well, we want to thank you  for doing this interview  with us.  Well, sure, no problem.  Um, yeah.  I hope it was fun for you.  It was fun.  Okay.  What did that little pussy  smell like when it came  out of the dryer?  Mountain spring air.  Really?  That's, I think that was  the bounce.  Any static cling?  Hey, Rachel,  we can only dream, 
[00:56:30]  you know?  Oh, my gosh.  You know, we got to the vet  and the first thing  the vet said is,  well, did he shrink?  Oh.  You know, we're like crying  and the vet says,  well, did it shrink?  I guess it was vet humor.  That's a funny vet.  I know.  Vet humor, yes.  Dr. Wayne Griffin.  And give that email address  out one more time.  For who?  For you.  For the listeners.  Okay, hang up the phone  and then I'll give it to you.  Hang up the phone?  We're...  Hang up.  Okay, I'll give it to you.  Go ahead.  All right.  W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L 
[00:57:00]  at  Chip Falls.  C-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S  dot  This is long now.  K-1-2  dot  W-I  dot  U-S.  This is your email address?  I work at a school.  I'm a counselor in a school.  Oh, great.  Yep.  Don't you guys got like  cable modems and stuff?  I don't know.  There's something called...  This is how the Wisconsin  school system email thing works. 
[00:57:30]  There's something called AOL.  Look into it.  I know.  You know, I should consider that.  I can't afford it  because I'm too busy  paying this bill.  Oh, she's trying to get the cash.  Well, the way you get it,  give that address out  one more time.  Okay.  W-A-L-L-A-C-R-L  at  Chip Falls.  C-H-I-P-F-A-L-L-S  dot  K-12  dot  W-I  dot  U-S.  Did you have to explain  to your students  about the tragedy  of your little pussy?  Well, you know, 
[00:58:00]  I'm a drug counselor.  Oh, you are?  I am.  What grade do you teach?  Well, I'm like a counselor  in a high school.  I work with  freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.  Hey, what kind of drugs  are the high school kids  doing these days?  Oh, you know.  We're a little out of touch.  Are you?  Are they doing the E?  They are.  Yeah.  They like the E, right?  A lot of alcohol,  a lot of pot,  and then all those other drugs.  Yeah.  You know what a good buzz is?  No.  You hop in a dryer  for 15 minutes.  I've heard that.  You will be spinning.  I'm thinking you were on the E  to allow your captains  to get trapped in a dryer.  I'm clean.  For how long?  Oh, you know,  I've never been 
[00:58:30]  chemically dependent.  But I actually am a teacher  and I've not had any kind of drug,  even including alcohol,  for about 18 years.  I'm sober.  What was the last drug you did?  Margarita.  That's not a drug.  Well, technically,  alcohol is a drug.  Gak, gak.  You're a lightweight.  No, no, no.  Try some AK-47.  Gak, gak, gak.  Do you really want to open up  that can of worms with me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you?  Well, I mean,  there are more people  with alcohol problems  in the United States  than any other drug combined.  Hey, you can go after yourself. 
[00:59:00]  Don't you agree?  I mean, most kids  start out with cigarettes  and they go to alcohol  and cops and other drugs.  So it kind of is  starts out that way.  Well, you know,  we've got to thin the herd, though.  And coming from a woman  that put her cat in the dryer,  yeah, I'll take that advice.  I know.  I've been waiting for this.  Stone sober.  I know.  I'm sober.  All right.  I did it with a sober mind.  Okay.  Rachel Wallace.  All righty.  I'm sure our listeners  will send you plenty of cash.  You get nothing.  You lose.  You guys have a great day. 
[00:59:30]  And we're glad  your pussy's doing well.  I am, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye.  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Rachel Wallace.  Rachel Wallace.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Owner of Twinkles,  the miracle cat.  Jesus.  The miracle pussy.  She must have been, uh...  All right.  That rocked.  Yeah, good.  Good interview.  See, that's a good interview  right there.  Nice.  Where's the new chick?  They better not have  dumped out of that.  I was talking about a cat  the whole damn time.  Of course.  Why would they dump? 
[01:00:00]  We'd be irresponsible  if we took any of the phone calls  on the phone screen right now.  Right.  See?  No one has pet roosters.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  The M.A.W.  212-757-1027.  We have to talk about  our third contest  that's running right now, Anthony.  We're contest crazy. 
[01:00:30]  In an O&A sort of way.  Right.  Let's not forget  we're also doing  Mommy, what would you do  for in-sync tickets?  I hate to be biased  because our contestopia  like our children.  But I do have a favorite.  And it is,  Mommy, what would you do  for in-sync tickets?  Nice.  The concept is great.  You got the mothers  of young daughters  that want to see in-sync  very badly.  Right.  The young girls.  Right.  And the mothers 
[01:01:00]  will do anything  to make their little girl happy.  Absolutely.  Anything.  Because the ages  of the girls  that usually want to see in-sync,  it's just when they start  butting heads with the mom.  Right.  Trying to make it  their own ground.  So, uh,  the moms will usually  do anything  to make their girls happy.  And what better  than in-sync tickets?  My God.  Well, we got to figure out  how to do this contest  the right way this time.  Yeah.  Because our mommy  what would you do  for Britney Spears contest  fell apart.  Will it be?  Yeah.  But, I mean,  it turned out okay  because we finally got 
[01:01:30]  one mommy to come down here  and shoot bottle rockets  out of her, uh,  out of her t***.  Okay.  Look.  What?  You can say that word  just not in that context.  Oh.  Like, I could say,  uh,  you're being a stupid twat.  And that would make the air.  Right.  But you can't refer  to certain parts  of the female anatomy.  So, when I said  that a mommy  came down here  and was shooting  bottle rockets  out of her t***. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  What?  Look, I'm at a dump now.  Oh, all right.  No, I'm just trying to learn.  Well,  why don't you sit down  with CBS lawyers  and they can beat you  about the head and neck  with phone books.  I've been doing radio  half my life  but I don't know  all the rules.  So, I'm glad  you're teaching me this one.  It's all in the context open.  Yes, I know, Anthony.  I could say  you're being a d***.  Right.  But then you can't  use that same word  to describe a certain 
[01:02:30]  part of the male anatomy.  Ah.  See how it works?  It's so simple  plain and clear.  Well, the fact remains  that mommy came down here  and shot bottle rockets  out of a peach.  There you go.  Out of a peach?  Yeah.  Out of her whale's eye.  Uh-huh.  That's also good.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  So, we saved that contest  but barely.  Yeah, because we had  a bunch of contenders  that were going to come up  and remember anal sex?  Yeah, I remember.  Going to have a couple 
[01:03:00]  come up here  and have anal sex.  Yeah, I remember.  Geez.  What does that have to do  with anything?  Yeah.  Well, they were going  to have anal sex  so their young son  could see Britney Spears.  Correct.  Right here in front  of everybody.  Correct.  They blew us off.  Yeah.  The mother-daughter  queefing team  blew us off.  But they did queef  over the phone.  Right.  Which was very good.  Remember the daughter  had the high piccolo  type queef  and the mother  was more like a bassoon.  It was cute.  Yeah, it was a family moment  right out of the Waltons, 
[01:03:30]  I would say.  Very, very quaint moment.  Right.  And we just need more people.  Instead of like  setting a day aside  where we have  all the mommies come down  and then we look like losers  when only one mommy shows up.  Uh-huh.  I think we should just say  contest is on.  Oh, that's good.  So now if somebody  has an idea  they come down and do it.  They can come down tomorrow  and set the bar.  Okay.  I like that idea.  That's much better  than a one day  no one shows up thing.  Oh, because those days  just suck.  Yeah.  So contest is on. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Mommy,  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  Yeah.  All right.  And also feel free  to call  and let us know  what this is  before you stop down.  Ah.  Gay Marco,  what's up?  Oh my God.  I have to have  these tickets.  Please.  Oh my God.  I love NSYNC.  Oh my God.  I stood outside.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Oh my God.  I stood outside  Good Morning America 
[01:04:30]  on Monday  for six hours  in the freezing cold  and I just saw  the top of their head.  That's all I could see.  Marco.  Marco.  Give us a hey.  Hey.  It's him.  I just have to confirm it.  You want to confirm  the hey's  to make sure  it's him, Anthony?  Hold on, Marco.  Let me get my hey.  I got the hey.  Oh, okay.  Here's your hey.  Here's Marco  doing the famous hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:05:00]  Hey.  That's him.  Gay.  Hey.  All right, gay Marco.  Oh my God.  Hey.  Oh my God.  Hey.  I have fantasies  of having an orgy  with NSYNC.  God damn it.  Jesus.  Justin Timberlake  on the bottom.  Then me.  Then JC.  Poor guy.  Then Joey Orley.  You're right.  Then Lance and Chris  in each hand.  Oh.  Oh my God.  He'd have everything  working. 
[01:05:30]  Hands, feet, mouth.  He'd look like a puppeteer.  Love him.  Love him.  Unbelievable this guy.  That's no strings.  Oh my God.  It's the no strings.  All right.  You're very excited.  Marco, even though  there is no chance  in hell we would  ever consider you  coming down here  and doing something,  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  I would give  oral sex to a woman  even though it would  make me vomit.  That's disgusting.  You know something?  Now that might be funny  to have him come down  and do that.  Oh my God.  That's as bad  as like asking  a straight guy 
[01:06:00]  to do it  to another guy.  To hob a knob.  Oh my God.  This guy is so  unbelievably gay  that the thought  of a lady  naked in front of him  disgusts him.  Oh God,  the smell of it.  It was just like  that.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He's all disgusting.  Marco,  just imagine it.  For the NSYNC tickets,  we bring in a  hot  19-year-old lesbian  with huge 
[01:06:30]  34 Ds.  Oh God.  You pull down  the tight cotton panties  and they're staring you  in the face.  Oh my God,  I have shrinkage.  They're staring you  in the face  is the sweetest,  youngest,  ripest peach heat.  Ew.  Ew.  Yeah,  and then  you slowly approach it  getting that nice,  unbelievable fragrance.  Yeah,  you know you're close  and then  after a little nuzzling, 
[01:07:00]  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop.  After a little nuzzling,  you're just,  you're face deep,  my friend.  Oh my God.  That's right.  And as you  take a taste  of the peach,  all of a sudden  you hear her say,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  now that would be  a hell of a,  oh my God,  that would be a hell of a  sexcapade.  eh,  eh,  eh,  what do you think,  Margo?  I would do anything. 
[01:07:30]  I would,  I would succumb to anything  to see and think.  I love them.  Hey.  Hey.  Eh,  eh,  hey.  Eh,  eh,  baby,  you're not the only one.  Oh.  You don't have to be afraid.  Is he hearing this?  I would sing all the songs.  Hey,  why don't you sing along  to this song for us,  right?  Yeah,  sing along.  I can't hear it.  All right,  you fag,  hold on.  Hold on,  you should be able  to hear this.  Ready?  Go.  It's tearing apart  when I'm with you. 
[01:08:00]  Hey.  When we are apart,  I feel it too.  Eh,  eh,  eh,  no matter  what I do,  I think you'll pay.  Come on,  sing.  With or without you.  Sing,  you homo.  Come on.  All right,  now wait,  then I have something else for you.  What?  I have Mets tickets  for Sunday night.  I'm already going.  My boyfriend dumped me  this week.  I'm so sad.  He took a dump on you? 
[01:08:30]  We broke up.  So I have nobody  to go with  to the game.  I'm so sad.  Yeah,  like it's so hard  to find another fag.  Pull out your fag bait  and troll around  Christopher Street.  Everyone is begging us  to have Marco  eat the peach.  Well,  that would be funny,  man.  for the NSYNC tickets.  Marco,  you're dead serious.  You really want  these NSYNC tickets.  I want these tickets  so bad.  Oh my God,  I have to see them.  I have to breathe  the same air as JC. 
[01:09:00]  Oh my God.  All right,  listen.  Listen,  Ant,  Ant,  let me put the plea  out there.  All right.  We need a lady.  If you're a faithful  listener to this show,  we need a lady  to take one for the team.  Marco,  can I ask you something?  Yeah.  What would be  more heinous to you?  A very hot looking girl  or an ugly looking,  maybe out of shape  type girl?  Yeah,  that's a good question.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's equally as disgusting.  Yeah,  because I guess  that's like asking us 
[01:09:30]  what would be worse,  a hot guy  or a fat guy.  Or a beer belly guy.  It's like,  how do you make that choice  unless you're Rick?  Hey,  Marco.  Yeah?  What if we found a girl  that is willing to have you,  you know,  take a taste of her peach  and then she gets  to go to NSYNC with you?  Oh,  I don't care.  Fine,  yes.  Hmm,  that is very interesting.  I don't have a boyfriend anymore,  so it doesn't matter.  The only thing is  it really takes out of the mix  the doing it  for your child's sake  because the mother now 
[01:10:00]  would have to go  or send her daughter  with Marco.  Sure,  I'll babysit.  Which is probably a safe date.  That's a very safe date.  Unless you got an ass  like a nine-year-old boy.  I mean,  come on,  we'd sing all the songs together.  I could do her hair.  Oh,  my God.  What a fact.  Oh,  my God.  Do you think  Richard Gere is cute?  No,  no.  No?  No?  Someone is moaning.  Sadiqa.  Yes?  Why are you moaning?  Because I want to see NSYNC.  And how old are you? 
[01:10:30]  18.  You're 18  and you want to see NSYNC.  Yes.  And listen,  she's crying.  All right.  Are you crying?  Yes.  Why?  Because I love her so much.  All right,  Marco,  cry along with Sadiqa.  Oh,  my God.  I love them.  Oh,  my God.  I love JC.  Oh,  my God.  Hey.  I want to see them so bad.  Sadiqa,  you love them,  huh?  Yes.  And you want,  have you ever seen them?  Yes,  I've seen them before.  Have you ever had a gay guy  go **** on you?  No. 
[01:11:00]  Oh,  my God.  So now,  why are you crying,  though?  I don't get it.  Because I love them.  You don't understand.  You don't know  unless you're there.  Yes,  Marco.  I've never been to  any of their concerts.  I thought you just said  you saw them already.  No,  I went to their hotel.  Oh,  and you saw them  go into the hotel?  Yeah.  And that's why  this contest is  pure brilliance.  Absolutely.  Mommy,  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  But now it's getting  even more twisted. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah,  because now  this girl is 18.  You're 18  and you're so like,  how good are our seats?  Great.  We have great seats.  Oh,  God.  Was that the girl  or Mark?  I know.  Who was that?  Right.  Sadiqa.  Yes.  Great seats.  Yeah.  Really close.  You'll get a great view.  Who's your favorite?  Joey.  Boo.  What?  What's wrong  with Joey?  What's the matter,  Marco?  Ew,  he's so dirty. 
[01:12:00]  No,  he's not.  Don't you make fun  of Sadiqa's name.  Well,  calm down,  everyone,  because we've got  a proposition  for everyone on the phone.  We know they're  all equally as hot.  No.  No.  Joey's the cutest.  All right,  Sadiqa.  J.C.  is the most talented  cutest.  No,  he's not.  A fag  and an 18-year-old girl  arguing over inside.  All right,  listen,  listen,  listen.  Someone better make sure  that Kristen on line one  does not hang up.  Right.  Because she is willing  to do this,  but we'll give  Sadiqa a try.  Sadiqa.  Yes. 
[01:12:30]  What are you willing  to do for  NSYNC tickets?  Anything.  Anything.  Would you be willing  to come into the studio?  What do you look like?  Yeah,  give us a little description.  Um,  I'm 5'4",  brown hailed,  blue eyes,  125 pounds.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Nice body?  Yes.  Young,  firm,  big boobs,  small boobs,  big.  Very nice.  Of what is your heritage?  Huh?  What is your heritage?  What's your background? 
[01:13:00]  Hello?  Yeah,  what's your background,  like your heritage?  What race are you?  I know the word's  a big one,  but, uh,  what's your nationality?  Sadiqa.  Hey,  where'd she go?  Sadiqa.  God damn it.  She's gone.  Yeah,  something clicked.  Marco?  Yeah?  I guess you might call back.  That's why I said,  make sure we don't  hang up on Kristen.  Kristen?  Yes,  what's going on?  Are you the one  willing to take one  for the team?  Yes,  but I want something  in return.  I don't like NSYNC,  so I don't want that.  All right.  Can I ask for something? 
[01:13:30]  Oh my God,  we got a ton of girls  that are willing to do this.  I have really,  really good seats for Dice.  I'm going to MSG.  Okay.  I want to know  if there's any way  in hell I'd be able  to at least meet him  and say hi.  Can we get this girl  backstage to meet Dice?  I think we can.  I think we can.  Okay.  And then you would be willing  to let gay Marco  taste your peach.  Oh God.  Yes.  I even asked my husband  and he said it was okay.  Oh my God. 
[01:14:00]  Whoa,  why would he say it's okay?  Because the guy's gay.  Yeah.  And so am I.  Can he be in the room  at the same time?  No.  Gay Marco,  this cannot be pleasurable  to you at all.  Stop saying.  I can bring three  of my girlfriends with me  and they can correct him  while he does it.  Yeah,  the three girls  all have to be like topless  and you're like bottomless  and then Marco  has to do the thing.  Oh God.  Kristen.  How bad do you want  these tickets, buddy? 
[01:14:30]  Oh my God,  I want them so bad.  Kristen.  Yeah?  Describe how hot you are  and listen to Marco lose it.  Well,  I have really big boobs.  Oh,  there you go.  Boobs,  Marco.  I have like blondish brown hair  and I'm five foot one  and  Nice shape.  Oh,  I have a nice shape.  Do you keep the peach trimmed?  Oh yeah,  very  and I have a tattoo  right next to it.  Oh,  yeah.  So Marco's going to be staring  right at it  inches away 
[01:15:00]  from the peach,  Marco.  Boo.  And then  I run my fingers  through his hair.  Oh yeah.  How long would you allow him  to taste the peach?  Well,  as long as you want to put him  through the torture  for the ticket.  Good.  You are a trooper.  You are good.  You are really a trooper.  I got it.  I got it.  How about  for the duration  of one NSYNC tune?  Oh.  You're not torturing me.  That ain't bad though.  That's like three minutes.  And Marco will  even allow you  to pick the NSYNC song. 
[01:15:30]  Okay.  But if there's not  action going on  during the whole song  then you're out.  Oh God.  Marco,  have you ever done  anything with a girl?  Never.  Never.  This is great.  This is great.  Oh my God.  I love it.  I think  we don't have  contest rules yet,  Anthony.  I think we might have  to change the contest.  All right.  Could you see Marco  getting finished  and going,  that was great guys.  Right.  Yeah.  I'll turn him straight.  When's Talica  coming to town? 
[01:16:00]  Dan's got a great suggestion.  What does Dan say?  That might be hard  to pull off.  Listen to Marco yell.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  How are you?  Good.  Tell Marco  your suggestion.  Hey, listen,  as a bad guy,  wouldn't it be  a little more torture  if he had to have  vaginal intercourse  with him?  Impossible.  Why is it impossible?  Yeah, why is it impossible?  Yeah, why?  It's just not  going to happen.  Why?  Because, I mean, 
[01:16:30]  right now I have shrinkage  so much from even  the thought of this.  Oh, God.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Marco?  Yeah.  All right.  And the deal is what?  Marco has to  eat the peach?  Yeah.  Marco, who is just  a flaming fag,  has to now  go south  on a girl  for the first time ever.  To Marco,  you guys got to  understand this.  For Marco to do this,  it is as disgusting 
[01:17:00]  as one of us  going south  on a guy.  There you go.  Marco,  you going to be all right?  I don't even know  what I would do.  He's never done this before.  Yeah, he's going to be  real experienced.  All I know is like  suction.  He's going to try  to stroke something.  Right.  All he knows is suction.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  There you go.  Thank you, Marco.  Thanks for that visual.  I think we got a connection.  Yeah, let's arrange a date  that we can do this. 
[01:17:30]  Marco, when can you do this?  Well, I have to go  into work and see  what day I can get off.  All right.  Get off.  Where?  From the florist  or the interior decorator  company.  From the factory.  Oh, that's right.  Sausage factory.  You were saying that?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Bye, bye, bye.  Bye, bye, bye.  It's so gay.  Sing, Marco.  Bye, bye, bye, bye. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh, dear.  And it's a nice  She's gonna start up  Hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Wonderful.  Think about it, Marco.  Okay.  All right, you get to pick  the NSYNC song  throughout the duration  of the song.  You have to eat the peach.  I can't wait to see this.  You guys, I need earphones 
[01:18:30]  or, like, earplugs  while he's doing it.  Why?  Because the thought  of, like, listening  to NSYNC  and being  out by a fag.  Oh, boy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Yeah, we can't  quite be so graphic.  That was good,  but, yeah,  it didn't make the radio.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  You want to block out  all the noise  is what you're saying,  so you need headphones.  Yeah.  Yeah, we want to hear  the music  and you certainly  don't want to hear Marco.  Yeah, I just want  to pretend I'm  somewhere else.  Okay.  Kristen, this is  a better way of putting it. 
[01:19:00]  This is probably  going to be the worst  oral you're ever,  ever going to have  in your life  because he is just  not even going to  know what to do with it.  Oh, my God.  If I don't vomit.  Marco, I'll be  dreaming about you.  You got everyone's  number and info  and everything.  And, Marco?  What have I done?  Well, you're going to,  hey, you're going to  go to NSYNC  is what you've done.  Oh, my God.  Yes, calm down.  Marco, I got some  audio of us  the day you have  to eat the peach.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hi. 
[01:19:30]  So you have,  we might have to  brief him on some  techniques.  Yeah, we'll have  like a bunch of guys  call and help him  out with some pointers  and stuff.  We'll walk you through it.  There are certain,  you know, little basic  rules to adhere to.  Right.  There you go.  It's not like  painting a fence.  It's not like  a man either,  so you don't have  to use your fist.  Oh, Christ.  He's so happy.  He's so,  what's another word  for happy?  Gay.  That's right.  All right,  we've got to take 
[01:20:00]  a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.

And, oh, yeah, we have a pro in the studio, of course.  We have Cassidy.  Cassidy's been giving a...  Professional p***h eater.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We had to jump out of that.  She goes professional, you know, and then the P-word eater.  P-gater.  Yeah.  Yeah, peach. 
[01:23:00]  Peach eater.  She's a professional peach eater.  She's done it before.  So, Cassidy, you could yell out stuff to Marco as he's doing this.  As long as it isn't, you know, lick that pee.  Eat that pee.  Get your nose in that pee.  Right.  You know, things that aren't that technical.  Okay.  Would be nice.  We'll get this down.  Now, Wendy, you ready?  You've been huffing and puffing over there.  A little nervous.  That's okay.  Let me get the mic over there.  He is red.  Get one last thing.  So, you're all ready for this?

You're going to sunbathe topless.  Oh, good God.  Marco, look at that.  Marco, look at her.  Isn't that beautiful?  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you heard it there.  Now, describe what Marco is wearing, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Marco has his lovely NSYNC T-shirt on with all the boys' faces emblazoned across the front.  Yeah.  He's got a bib on that says, I love Daddy, just in case any of that peach drips on him.  He doesn't want to ruin that NSYNC shirt.  And then he's got a bag full of hygiene products, oral hygiene and breath mints and gum and toothpaste.  Some kind of mouthwash.  Altoids and Wrigley and Tic Tacs.  Well, I'm sure with some of the places your face is gone, you carry that around a lot, right? 
[01:24:30]  No, well, I'm just, hey, I'm just thinking, you know, my overnight bag.  It's an overnight bag, sure.  Okay.  You know, come on.  What's the clothespin for?  He brought a clothespin.  Now, that's a little insensitive, Marco.  I know.  And now that I've met lovely, what was her name?  This is very typical for me, you know.  Ah, not knowing the name.  Wendy, Wendy.  I knew that, Wendy.  Lovely Wendy.  Now that I've met her, I know that she is going to be fresh smelling, so I won't be needing any... 
[01:25:00]  Oof.  I won't be needing...  Oof!  You really don't know, girls.  No.  Let me tell...  Wait.  You know something?  Let me say something.  Yeah, let me explain why I said that.  This is just a fallacy, because there's a few, let's just say, bad peaches that ruin  it for everybody.  She seems very hygienic.  Well, no, the problem I was trying to get at was the whole friend thing.  That's right. 
[01:25:30]  Our friend.  But you know something?  There are various feminine hygiene products during that time of month that keep things fresh.  Wendy, I apologize.  Oh, fine.  All right, good.  All right, she's okay with it.  If you ruin this before it happens, I'm going to punch you in the face.  Okay, we ready?  Yes.  All right, Wendy, if you would assume the position, as they say.  Oh, my God.  Wow, what is she wearing?  She's got...  Well, you've got to give them enough room, like, to the knees or something.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, to the knees. 
[01:26:00]  Don't worry.  We're all friends and family here.  She's got a pair of hot black panties.  Don't worry.  You know something?  Take a breath, shut your eyes, and let your inhibitions just melt away.  Would you like a blindfold?  Melt away.  Yeah.  A blindfold.  Because Marco's got to be able to...  I'll tell you something.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  The knees apart thing is very difficult for a guy.  All right.  Because that really strains the neck.  What about me?  Well, you've got to be able to...  Yeah, you've got to be able to...  Is this good?  To really...  Yeah, because he could get in there. 
[01:26:30]  You could pop your head through.  Oh, my God.  Marco, she's like...  You okay?  Bend over me.  Bend over me.  How about you?  No, but that doesn't work like that.  But she likes in the air.  He can't get to the goods.  Come here.  Oh, look at Marco.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Okay, get the song ready.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're holding hands.  He is now kneeling down right in front of her.  She is sitting on the famous couch, and he's crying.  Marco?  Marco's crying. 
[01:27:00]  Marco.  How much do you want to sing?  Do it for JC.  Oh, God.  JC.  It's JC.  You might need him.  I know, I know, I know.  Think of JC.  JC.  Now, wait a minute.  He can't get to that that way.  He's got to go from that way.  Yeah, there you go.  That's perfect.  But you don't understand.  I understand.  You know what?  No, no.  Look, look.  We all understand.  Look, you know what you could do?  Stay like that until everything's ready to happen, and then let it ride, and he will do  what he's got to do. 
[01:27:30]  Okay?  Comment?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We will...  He will be coached.  He will be coached by the lovely Cassidy.  Now, Opie, the song's got to start, and then Marco will go to work.  Are you shaking, Marco?  How are you doing, Marco?  I'm just keeping it down right now.  You're okay, Marco.  He's going to have a heart attack.  No, Marco, you're okay.  I don't know if he can do it.  It's not that bad, Marco.  Yeah, not that bad.  Okay.  I just think I'm in another place right now. 
[01:28:00]  Right, another place.  Yeah.  You're okay.  He's sweating.  He's sweating like crazy.  Okay.  He will not look at her.  All right, if we can get the music started, maybe, and we will go.  We have a go.  All right.  Ready?  Three.  Let's light this candle.  What, what, what, what?  What do I do first?  Okay.  All right, Marco.  Calm down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  What you do first, Marco.  Right when the song starts, and the beautiful gates of pleasure open up, you take the area 
[01:28:30]  right here, and you go sort of right, right below the, yeah, yeah, she will point right  to it.  Keep my eyes open, though.  Okay, I'll, I'll show you real fast, and then you can close it.  Okay.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  Okay, go.  Can I look at it first?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, give him a quick look.  Oh, my God.  No, Marco, get out.  Don't leave.  Marco, get out. 
[01:29:00]  Marco, come here.  Go back.  Marco, come here.  Come here.  Marco, come here.  He feels like, no, Marco, come here.  Come here.  What was that?  No, Marco.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco.  I swear, it was like a scene on Alien.  He freaked out.  And for the people playing at home, we just saw the hottest.  Right, right.  If you're, if you're a heterosexual guy, you would have just went like, oh, my God. 
[01:29:30]  Good God.  Oh, my God.  Marco.  Marco.  Marco, take a breath.  Now, let's get back into position.  Here, watch.  I'll hold your hand if you want.  Oh, she'll hold your hand.  I'll hold your hand.  As long as I know.  Opie's behind me.  Oh, boy.  Opie, just say yes, yes, yes.  And shut up.  Just come.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  All right, he is back, kneeling.  He was not looking, though.  Now, right when the music starts, she will again, the gates will open, and you will. 
[01:30:00]  Wait, make him look at it again.  Oh, God, that ruins it, dude.  It's so funny, though.  Come on.  Mike, come and make him look at it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Open.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why does it stick out like this?  That's a woman.  That's a woman.  What do you think?  Marco's crying.  Marco, it's okay.  You're making me feel bad.  There's no crying.  It'll make her feel bad.  I'm sure it's beautiful, but it is beautiful. 
[01:30:30]  It could have been over with already.  What do you mean?  Right.  See?  Okay.  Opie, no more showing.  In sync.  JC.  Just think JC.  JC.  JC.  Yes.  JC.  JC.  JC.  Suck it up.  That's JC.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You okay?  Hold on.  We've got to make sure everyone's okay before we start the song.  You just got to last.  I'm fine.  I'm ready.  You got to last three minutes and 20 seconds, Marco.  Can I just give you, I'll give you a pointer real quick.  All right.  If you want, go stick a Tic Tac in your mouth right now and eat it while you're doing it. 
[01:31:00]  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  That's a very good suggestion.  Good.  Good.  Good.  I could better.  Piece of gum.  Good.  Altoid.  There's an Altoid.  He's shaking like a car on bad jazz.  Is that okay, Marco?  Hey.  Yes.  He's got his I Love Daddy Biv on.  He is all set to go.  His NSYNC shirt.  He is kneeling before a beautiful girl and he is now ready when the NSYNC song starts 
[01:31:30]  to consume the peach, as they say.  Mm-hmm.  You ready, Marco?  Okay.  She will, again, point where you're supposed to go.  And let me make this clear, Marco.  Now, you know I'm your pal.  But if that song starts and too much time goes by before you start, we're going to stop  the song and start over again.  All right?  Okay.  Okay.  Ready?  Are we ready?  Here we go.  Marco, take it away.  Win your NSYNC tickets. 
[01:32:00]  Right there, baby.  Where's the music?  It's going.  I can hear him.  Stop.  Wait.  Wait.  He has to hear the music.  Hold on.  Hold on.  First try.  The first try.  The headphones.  Marco's headphones don't reach.  All right.  Get the headphones on them.  You got to get them to reach.  Get the...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  His legs are shaking.  Marco.  I'm going to fall over.  Marco.  Take those headphones.  You'll hear your beautiful NSYNC.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  You okay?  All right.  All right.  It's all NSYNC now.  That's all you're going to hear is your JC.  JC.  And talk to Wendy for a sec.  Because there was contact.  I'm getting nervous.  He's making me nervous now.  It's not about you, baby.  It's about him.  Now, Opie, no.  Something didn't happen like that.  Oh, no?  It didn't.  There was never contact.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I've never actually seen such struggle with a girl pulling a guy's head.  I see it the other way around sometimes, but you never...  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  The song is going to start, Marco. 
[01:33:00]  You've got to loosen up.  She's pulling on your head like, I don't know what.  Any guy would be dying right now, Marco.  Look at this t***.  Marco, you're so gay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Marco, you're so gay.  Thank you.  Yes, Marco.  All right.  Is the song ready again?  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Take two.  Let it rip.  And we have contact.  Oh, my God. 
[01:33:30]  He's doing it.  Mike Wendy, because she's making some bizarre faces.  Wait, what?  Wait, what?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Wendy, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  This is so weird.  Is it working?  No, it's not working.  Keep going, Marco.  All right.  Let's see.  Side to side.  Side to side.  Her face. 
[01:34:00]  She's like, she's got her head going back and forth like, no, no, this is awful.  Look at her.  Talk to Wendy.  Talk to Wendy.  Wendy, how you doing?  He's doing a wonderful job.  No, he's not.  No, no.  And two and a half minutes to go.  No audio coming from the area.  Two and a half minutes to go.  Wait, Wendy, is he still doing it?  He's doing it.  Yeah, Marco, don't just keep your head down there.  You've got to work it.  Don't just stare at it.  There he goes. 
[01:34:30]  Wendy, why are you, like, freaking out so much?  What is he doing in particular that's so freaking out?  He's so gay.  He wasn't?  He wasn't?  It's so, I asked him a lot of the problems.  He goes, it's so gay.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  Two minutes.  Two minutes to go.  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  Tell us what he's doing wrong.  He's coughing or crying or something.  Marco, almost there.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You can't do it.  You can't do it.  Great.  What's he doing wrong?  He's coughing or coughing or coughing or coughing or coughing and he's coughing. 
[01:35:00]  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  It's almost done.  His legs are flailing.  It's as if someone was chopping his head off.  You okay?  What is the difference between good and what he's doing?  Good actually makes me smile, like, for real.  This is freaking you out.  Maybe if you grab the back of his head, he'll do a little better.  And he shakes his head.  No. 
[01:35:30]  I've got to see if he's doing this right.  You get your head in there, my friend.  I sit there.  All right.  You tell us if he stops.  How much longer?  How much longer?  We're at the one minute warning.  One minute, Marco.  One minute, Marco.  You're all man.  You're all man.  You're all man.  Look at this gay guy go.  He's doing push-ups or something.  Is he getting better as time goes on?  No, he's getting worse.  He's getting worse.  Marco, say something.  Marco, how are you doing?  No, keep going.  You're almost there. 
[01:36:00]  Say something.  Don't lose contact or we start over.  Say something.  Hum.  Hum or do something.  Hum.  All right.  You seem to have settled down.  Listen to breathe.  30 seconds, Marco.  30 seconds.  The song's almost over.  JC.  Think JC.  Marco, JC.  Is this the worst you've ever had?  I can't even explain this right now. 
[01:36:30]  Five, four, three, two, one.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, how does it feel?  Marco.  How does it feel?  I'm going to the sink.  Look at him crying on the floor.  He's crying on the floor with a little pip on in his instinct shirt.  He's in the fetal position.  Marco, you did it.  Marco.  Hey, was that the worst ever?  That was so bad. 
[01:37:00]  All right, they're putting altoids in his mouth, Annie.  I can't even describe it.  Very bad.  Marco?  Not a hint of pleasure.  No.  Marco.  Marco.  Is he coming to yet?  Marco?  Marco, he's still on the floor.  He's breathing heavy.  It's over.  You did good.  Very good, Marco.  Marco?  And then right when he came away, he took his I Love Daddy bib and just wiped his face with it, crying.  You all right there, Marco?  Yeah.  Let's not forget that Wendy had her friend. 
[01:37:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Marco?  Yeah.  He's crying.  Marco.  Why are you crying?  Are you okay?  I'm okay.  Wait, he's really crying.  You all right?  I'm fine.  You all right?  Yep.  How was it for you?  It was great.  Wait, are you crying because of what you just did or because you just won the NSYNC ticket?  Vote.  Oh, my God.  It's okay, Marco.  Guys would have loved doing what you were just doing there.  It was awful.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:00]  What was the most horrible thing about it, Marco?  The taste.  Oh, no.  Now, Wendy, don't let this be a reflection on you.  He is a gay man.  You know, he likes things like Man A, you know, so we really got to keep things in perspective  here.  It just tasted so weird.  So weird?  Yes.  From a guy that likes Man A.  Look at him.  Well, Marco, let me present to you two tickets to NSYNC No Stinks Attached at the Continental 
[01:38:30]  Arena.  Congratulations.  I hope that makes it a little easier for you.  Yes.  Yes, it does.  Thank you so much.  Oh, that's the funniest thing you've ever seen.  It was the best thing we've ever done.  Oh, my God.  He's sweating.  He's beat red.  He's tearing.  Horrified.  Are you all right, Marco?  I'm going to be fine.  Did you start getting into it at all?  No.  No?  It was just horrible.  And, Wendy, you were saying it was not pleasurable at all.  No.  Someone get Marco a banana.  Now, for a guy, even a bad one is kind of good. 
[01:39:00]  Sure.  Just because it's happening?  But that wasn't even happening?  It was just because it was really weird because he's so really gay.  The gayness came through in his...  If I didn't know he was gay, it probably wouldn't have been, like, as, like, bad.  But because he is, and I definitely take that into consideration why.  He's a trooper, though, because he did it the whole time, man.  He did.  He didn't come up for air once.  Not once.  I almost puked.  Well, that's good.  Again, Wendy, no reflection on you.  You've got to remember where it's coming from. 
[01:39:30]  Well, Marco's got the in-sync tickets, and Wendy has a trip for two to Cancun, Mexico,  courtesy of EastStudentTravel.com.  Wow.  Congratulations to everybody.  Beautiful job.  The number one student travel service in America, EastStudentTravel.com.  Now, let's go to our house porn star.  Oh, adult film actress.  I'm sorry.  Cassidy, 19 years old.  Cassidy, you witnessed the whole thing.  How does that rate with some of the porn star actors that you've seen working the same area? 
[01:40:00]  That was pretty sad.  Oh, I love Wendy.  A little kiss on the cheek, and he is even more disgusted.  Unbelievable.  Marco, any final thoughts?  Yeah.  No.  Is that the worst thing you've ever, ever done in your life?  Yes.  Wow.  Was that the worst thing ever done to you, Wendy?  Yes, definitely.  No doubt about it.  All right.  Our mission is done here.  Okay, great.  Bravo.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you very much, all involved.  You're going in sync.  There you go.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll be back. 
[01:40:30]  212-757-1027.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Totally.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  You've got to try to convince her, man.  All right, I'll do my best.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, darling?  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah?  Well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I've got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous.  Something I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  How come you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you. 
[01:41:30]  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah, okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I had to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people. 
[01:42:00]  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me.  I haven't had enough heartache.  I think, you know, good God.  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Bobby, what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah, all right, all right.  Okay, I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No, I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah, that's nice. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arm's reach.  Bobby, don't give me that balloon, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She's got to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay. 
[01:43:00]  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  I don't take you.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah, I'm a twinkie, Bob.  That's how I got the throat this bad, Bob.  I've been swallowing too many ropes.  Hey, Bob.  Bob.  You sit down, Bob.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  You want to call your mom back and then call us?  Yeah, I've got to get her head out of the oven.  All right.  We'll recognize your voice. 
[01:43:30]  Call back, all right?  All right.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:44:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We have Mike from the garage in the studio.  He's a good friend of ours.  Yeah.  We see him every day.  We're going to call you Jamaican Mike.  Yeah.  You're from Jamaica, right?  Yeah.  How long?  How long you been up here?  Fourteen years.  Fourteen years.  You still got the cool thing because it works with the chicks, right?  You know what?  See? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  He's probably like, you know, when we go off the air, what do you really sound like?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  How you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Just my guts will sound smooth.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Have you ever said, yeah, man?  Yeah.  You say, it's all good?  He's saying, it's all good.  Yeah.  You go on vacation down south, way down south of the town.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Why wouldn't it be?  Damn.  That must be. 
[01:45:00]  Guy's getting chicks with an accent, dude.  Jesus Christ.  Nothing wrong with that.  Hey, Jamaican Mike.  Do you just, like, pound girls when you're not working?  I can't say that, man.  Oh, you got the special lady, right?  You know it.  You know it?  You know it.  What kind of lady is she?  Hmm?  Is she a nice lady?  Yeah, she's beautiful, man.  Did you steal one of our white women?  Huh?  Yeah.  Did you?  You got the prize of the community? 
[01:45:30]  Did you steal one of our white women?  Come on, you can be honest.  No.  Oh, no.  You got a fine ebony princess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah?  I'm good, man.  I'm good.  Yeah?  I'm good.  But no.  I think he's got a white woman, man.  Come on.  Help us out.  I bet he's packing a baby's arm, clutching an apple.  Right?  The myth.  The Louisiana black snake.  The Jamaican boa constrictor. 
[01:46:00]  You know it.  The boner constrictor.  You know a lot of white girls go to Jamaica for that, though.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I've heard.  Well, that's what happens.  They get into the fight with the boyfriend.  They go down there and, boy, have an awakening.  They come back limping.  They come back limping.  Yeah, you wreck it for us when they get back to the States. 
[01:46:30]  You could forget about it.  It's like, oh, there's that cute little thing again.  You're right.  There you go.  Gee, thanks.  I've got to strap a board on the back of my butt now.  No chance for you when you return, man.  Yeah.  Jamaica.  Yeah.  Jamaica crotch bleep.  Look at his hat.  His hat describes his junk ant.  What does it say?  Fat hat. 
[01:47:00]  It's all good.  It's all good.  I can relate because a guy.  Oh, you can't hope it.  No, listen, listen.  A guy.  A guy.  That's bad.  That's bad for you.  We went down to Turks and Caicos.  Let me explain.  Okay.  A guy that looked very similar to him, right, Ant?  You were there.  Yeah.  All over my woman.  Nothing I could do.  If he wanted her, what was I going to do?  A lasso her with his junk.  Right.  Like, spin it over his head like a rope.  What happened?  I think we got out of there alive. 
[01:47:30]  I'm tired.  I think we did all right.  I was able to, you know, convince her that I was the better man.  Let's get back to the States.  Wasn't he the guy selling herb, too?  He was the guy.  What the hell was his name?  And then he would just walk around.  It's all good.  And he had white women all over his damn...  Whoa.  All over his body.  Oh, yeah?  That's great, man.  He must have pounded ten chicks that week alone.  And one of them, he wanted to be my girlfriend.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, without a doubt. 
[01:48:00]  The hell was his name?  Oh.  Dexter.  That one, Eddie Murphy, right?  Well, Jamaican Mike, we're going to try to make you feel at home here.  Yeah, that's cool.  Looks like the CD player smoked too much weed, though.  It doesn't play?  No, hold on.  Let's see if that works.  See how I cleaned the CD?  Yeah.  Rubbed it on my shirt here.  Here we go.  Let me feel it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.

Yeah, and of course, you don't reveal, Becca, until we ask you.  Right.  So, Becca?

Oh, my God.  If you, uh...  If I can still walk, please?  I believe we have a sound clip of Becca when she meets Jamaican Mike.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[01:57:00]  All right, Becca.  If you stump Jamaican Mike, we'll give you wrestling tickets, but you can't lie.  Oh, I won't lie.  All right.  Very good.  I'll let you.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, why don't you rub the phone up and down.  Okay.  Hold on.  Listen carefully.  Whoa.  Did you hear?  Yeah.  It sounds like you lost it.  Right.  All right.  Was that up and down? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, it was up and down.  Now, do a side to side.  Okay.  Hold on.  Slowly.  Okay.  Was that good?  Okay.  Now, uh, circular motion.  Very slowly.  Okay.  Hold on.  Sounds like she's going over a large pothole.  Maybe she is, though.  How many times have you been in Jamaica?  Nothing, Becca. 
[01:58:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Do you need to hear circular again?  No, I got a pretty good line on this, I think.  You do?  Yeah.  I'm going to go off of my normal, uh...  Well, uh, let Jamaican mic go first.  All right.  Oh, you don't need me to do it again?  Yeah, I want to hear it one more time.  All right, go ahead.  One more time?  Circular motion.  Circular motion.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  Is that okay?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  That's very good.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Uh, to our guest, uh, Jamaican mic. 
[01:58:30]  The choices are, uh, triangle.  Mm-hmm.  Basic triangle.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Um.  Hitler mustache, which is a very short little thin thing.  Okay.  Uh, the mohawk, which is self-explanatory.  Mm-hmm.  Or the wood floor.  Totally clean.  Or the, uh, the pool rack filled with, uh, dreadlocks.  Well...  No, that's not a dreadlock, so...  No, definitely not.  No, definitely not.  I would say a wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Okay.  Anthony? 
[01:59:00]  Um, I am going to say mohawk.  Mohawk.  Uh, see...  She tans in the nude.  She tans in the nude.  It's all over.  Uh, it's a wood floor.  Becca!  You're going to say wood floor.  Yeah.  What is in your pants?  Okay, well, it's not a wood floor.  Okay?  Yeah?  What were the other ones you said?  I said mohawk.  Okay, well, it's sort of like that, but it's very, very, very, very thin and very, very,  like, very close.  Like, it's like not even in half of an inch. 
[01:59:30]  Okay, but it's thin.  Oh, you got a little, like, exclamation point.  It doesn't matter how thick it is, Opie.  A mohawk is a line of hair.  Is it a line of hair?  Yep.  And it's not short like a little Hitler mustache.  No, but it's, like, long.  There you go.  I'm giving myself the victory.  Anthony won again, but you did stump Jamaican Mike, so we will give you the wrestling tickets.  Cool.  Thank you so much.  Becca, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you.  Any final words to Jamaican Mike?  Uh, not really.  All right.  There's nothing to say.  All right, hold on the line, Becca.  There she goes.  Give her the wrestling tickets.  And we got to take a quick break.  A bunch of people on hold.  They got Jamaican stories.  Oh, my God.  This could get pretty interesting.  Look at Poi Jason on line nine.  I know.  My fiance in Jamaica now without me.  Oh, man.  Maybe you could tell him what's, uh...  That's good.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll go to him after break, and you can tell him maybe what he can expect when she gets 
[02:00:30]  back.  Yodel-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod.  Wait, wait.  Do that again.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Here's his fiance.  Say.  I got a couple of brothers down there.  Yodel-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-lod-a-l-a-l-a-lod-a-l-a-lod-a-l-a-l-a-l-a.  Yodel-a-lod-a-lod-a-l-a-l-o-a-lod-a-l-a-l-a-l-a-l-a-l-a-l-il-a-l-a.  Hello.  Hello.  Ok.  Bye-now gullum.  Honey.  Honey.  You're back from Jamaica.  What the hell's that sound?  That's amazing. 
[02:01:00]  Dumb, huh?  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit,  because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon. 
[02:02:00]  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good, good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone. 
[02:02:30]  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I can get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take the fees, the fees, the fees, the fees...  A massacard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if... 
[02:03:00]  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  Take your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  High up...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Girls?  We have black ladies. 
[02:03:30]  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  But wait...  No, no, no, no, no.  Hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[02:04:00]  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  212-757-1027.  We're talking about Jamaica.  And how paranoid we get when our ladies go down there without us.  Because they run into guys like Mike here.  Oh, forget about it.  That's it.  They're coming back ruined.  What was once, uh, boy, tighter than a thimble is now like, remember the old movie you see 
[02:04:30]  where the mother comes out and wants everybody to come back to the house for vittles?  So she puts the thing in that triangle bell and goes,  Lang, lang, lang, lang, lang, lang, lang.  That's what it ends up looking like.  What happened?  Wow!  What the hell happened?  And she went to Jamaica.  Like throwing a crowbar down an empty hallway.  Down the hallway. 
[02:05:00]  All right, let's go to Jason.  He's over, Johnny.  Jason's getting really paranoid because, uh, I guess his fiance is in Jamaica right now without him.  Uh, Jason, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  What's up?  We're talking to you.  Let's go.  So you, uh, your, your fiance is in Jamaica?  Yeah.  Uh, I'm home laying tile.  And, uh, my buddy walked in and said, well, well, guess what?  Insert your own joke there.  Someone is laying pipe in Jamaica right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I figured.  She's laying tile, too.  He, uh, resides on the beach.  Huh?  She's laying tile, too. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, I bet she is.  His name's tile.  This sucks.  What is Jamaican Mike?  They got those wacky names down there.  Hey, tile.  Come on.  Meet Dexter and tile.  Dexter St. John, right?  All right.  Yeah, swinging.  So you want to ask, uh, Jamaican Mike a question about?  If I might ask, what happens?  What happens?  And should I take the ring back now?  No.  Don't take it back, man.  She's just having fun.  Yeah, well.  She's having fun.  She certainly is. 
[02:06:00]  If you're lucky, dude, she'll, uh, maybe just be with one of the smaller guys.  Eight to ten inches.  Uh, and, and you'll still have something left to salvage.  Yeah.  And when she gets back.  Oh, this sucks.  Oh, Jason.  She's down there.  I'm going out tonight.  That's it.  She's down there right now?  Huh?  Have you talked to her?  Yeah, she's been calling me every night.  Every night, huh?  Every night.  Well, she's just making sure you're not surprising her down there.  Yeah.  You know, because when you get the phone call, you know you have at least, uh.  She wants to make sure I'm home. 
[02:06:30]  That's it.  You have at least like six, seven hours.  Right.  If she calls from the airport.  If you call, forget about it.  She's coming home tomorrow, though.  Oh, she is?  So, she was only there for five days, so it's only minimal damage, hopefully.  Hey, wait a minute.  We have some audio from your fiancée.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  I guess you guys need to keep clenching somebody. 
[02:07:00]  She goes, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.  Hum, hum, hum.  Hum, hum.  Oh, man.  Have your girls ever gone there?  Uh, no.  No.  Oh, no.  I guess you're not that dumb, huh? 
[02:07:30]  No.  No, it's good.  It's all good.  Don't worry.  Jamaica Mike's saying it's all good.  Don't worry.  Jamaica Mike says it's all good.  All right.  It's all good.  Oh, it's all good.  It's all good.  I'll let you know if she comes home and I have to go, hello, hello.  Uh, yeah.  Call me.  Thank you.  All right?  Oh, man.  There goes, Jason.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Great. 
[02:08:00]  So, I feel bad for Jay's girl, I'll tell you.  Well, for Jay.  His girl's out there getting it right now, isn't she?  But, say.  Probably a lot of it, man.  My ex-girlfriend didn't call me at all when she was away.  Dirty pig.  I don't know, man.  I tell you, she came back, though.  It was terrible.  It was like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.  It's really a bad thing, I think, once they get down there.  All right.  Have a good one, guys. 
[02:08:30]  See, this is what we didn't want to hear.  Now the ladies are calling.  Tammy is going to crush all of us.  Tammy, what's going on?  Say it.  Go ahead, Tammy.  Say it.  Say it.  What's up?  It's true.  What?  It's true.  What's true?  What's true?  Wait, hold on a second.  What's true?  Keep it.  Hi, mate.  What is she doing?  Tammy, what are you working?  No, no.  I was at the gas station.  They asked me to turn my car off.  What's longer?  The guys' slongs in Jamaica or the gas hose coming out of the pump? 
[02:09:00]  It's not just the length.  Oh, yeah?  Well, what do you want to say?  Yeah, what do you want to say?  We're doing a radio show here.  Tammy.  If they're going to Jamaica, I won't come back.  I think she's been bludgeoned with Jamaican member over her head.  And she's a little slow now.  There's a bunch of dents in her brain.  Man, help us out.  Going to Jamaica.  And how does a girl talk her boyfriend into going to Jamaica alone? 
[02:09:30]  It's like, could you go to your girlfriend and go, yeah, well, I'm just going to go visit like a whorehouse in Vegas.  Yeah, and I got all these free coupons for like free hummers and, you know, butt sex and stuff.  And I'll just go there.  Later.  Chris from the Bronx wants Jamaican Mike to say, look what I did to you again with that accent it has.  Mike, you have to say that for us.  Just say, look what I did to you again. 
[02:10:00]  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, I'm on.  Mary, what's going on?  I'm calling in about the fact that the Jamaicans, the man that called in earlier, that said that his fiance is down there and she's calling him.  Yeah.  Better watch out because I live with the Jamaicans.  Yeah.  And that little stereotype about the big thing is true.  It's true.  Oh, yeah.  My boyfriend's from Cholone.  Cholone?  I'm from St. Thomas. 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  St. Thomas.  Between Portland and Kingston.  Right.  Yeah.  He's got family there as well.  They measure distance in penis over there.  So that's like, what, 25 penis away or something like that?  Wow.  All right.  And Mary, he just pounds you and pounds you.  He takes care of it every night.  Mary, how huge is it?  Is it like a shopping bag now? 
[02:11:00]  Can you remember when it was the size of a normal private area?  No.  No.  No.  It's just seven years.  Hi, Junior.  Seven years.  You know, he takes care of it.  That's all that fits.  Does it give you acid reflux from hitting your stomach?  It's like an old man's mouth when he pops his teeth out.  Oh, God.  Oh, man. 
[02:11:30]  Do you walk like I have a rash all the time?  No.  No?  You get used to it after a while, but I'm not going nowhere else.  But that's it.  You can't, there's no turning back now.  You've set the bar to a certain level, and it's over.  When you're naked and you're walking around your house, does it sound like you're wearing  corduroys?  No, it's fine, but he takes care of it, and, well, Jamaican, hot nuts. 
[02:12:00]  When you get into the bathtub, does the water level go down?  Well, I love you.  You guys are great.  He got me into listening to you.  All right.  You roll.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  That's something.  We're breaking some ground here.  Finding out Jamaicans have really big ones. 
[02:12:30]  Geez.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Very good.  How are you guys?  We're doing all right.  You guys are the greatest.  You make my drive home the greatest.  Thank you.  When I was down in Jamaica, they had lots of wooden statues with these large Jamaican  junks, if you will.  Really?  They call it the Big Bamboo, and they have shirts that say, Who's Afraid of the Bamboo?  That's how you get used to looking at it on a statue before you have to see the real  thing, I'm sure.  If you want to try it out, you can back into it. 
[02:13:00]  It's the plunger thing all over again.  Oh, man.  So, did you have any of that Jamaican sex down there?  No, I didn't.  I was 12, but a lot of Jamaicans registered in me.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Okay.  Terrific.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Let's go to Brad.  Hot and huge penises.  Why would girls come back?  Why do they come back?  Yeah.  Why do they come back, Mike?  That's like a strip club that gives away free beer and never closes. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Why would the guy leave?  Brad.  ONA, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing, Jamaican, Mike?  I'm doing pretty good.  You?  I'm doing all right.  All right.  I got this ridiculous story.  I better be careful how I tell it, too, being on the radio, but you hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  So, a friend of mine, a close friend of mine, he went down to Jamaica for spring break  this year, and he went into this bar, and they were actually having, what's the best  way to put this?  Just the random girls at the bar, they were having an oral contest. 
[02:14:00]  How's that?  Whoa.  Like a hummer contest?  Absolutely.  So, girls that were just at the bar were giving hummers to guys?  He said, basically, it were a bunch of random guys they had lined up there, and they were  just picking out of these just drunk girls that were just at the bar, and they all, you  know, got down and all at the same time started.  And whoever could get the guy first got, like, prizes and drinks and stuff like that. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  He said it was pretty unbelievable.  Yeah.  Keep going, baby.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm almost there.  It's all good, though.  It's all good.  All right, Brad.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go to the bar.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How are you?  I got a funny Jamaican story for you.  I had no idea what Jamaica was all about, but the men's units down there were huge. 
[02:15:00]  Ten years ago, get married, right?  My wife and I, we were only with each other before this.  We were two virgins on our honeymoon.  We got down there.  And, you know, you go to the club med scene or the hotels down there, and you just stay  kind of by yourself.  Well, one night, we decided to venture out to go to the local scene to kind of catch out  what's going on.  Biggest mistake ever.  Wow.  We go to this luau, this type of thing where, like, all the local guys are there.  We're hanging around a bonfire, eating and drinking.  All of a sudden, my wife starts dancing with one of these guys. 
[02:15:30]  And this guy started sporting wood, if you know what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that thing could have covered half of D.C.  He was like an umbrella.  It was like an umbrella in a cage.  Ever since that man.  Ever since that man.  Excuse me.  Can we see your stuff? 
[02:16:00]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Torture!  It's torture!  Wow.  So what happened, Johnny?  So, I'm sitting here in amazement, and her eyes are like the snake from Jungle Book.  You know what I mean? 
[02:16:30]  You know, that snake with the eyes are all googly-eyed, and she's just, like, staring at that thing.  Dude, it has never been the same.  Ten years later, it has never been the same.  She looks at it like bananas different now.  Oh, yeah?  Hmm, stick it in my mouth.  Of course, talking about the joints in Jamaica, Anthony.  Yes.  Yeah, the joints.  The joints.  Right.  Yeah.  Ouch.  I never, I never sized up since then.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I just have to thank, you know, the Jamaican men for ruining it for the rest of us small 
[02:17:00]  white men.  Thanks a lot, Mike.  All right.  Take care.  Bye, Johnny.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  You're on the natural, man.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Barrett was on the natural.  That was hilarious.  The girl, the snake from Jungle Boy.  The eyes, you're getting these big, huh?  She's just looking at that.  Whoa, that's horrible.  Her face was like those wacky paintings you see in the subway where the girls had the big, 
[02:17:30]  huge eyes.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing?  All right, I got a story for you.  Yeah.  I was down in Jamaica for spring break about two months ago.  All right, I'm at this bar.  First of all, these guys, these local guys are cool.  So, you know, they flock to the bars, and they just, you know, will stand around all  cool in the back of the bar with, like, the joints behind her.  There's plane loads of white chicks coming in.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to go to the bars?  I see.  Here comes another one, man.  We go out.  I see the hottest white girl I've ever seen. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  I see her.  I don't have the courage to go talk to her.  Finally, like, on the third night, I get a couple of red stripes of me.  I'm going to go and talk to her.  I see her in the corner of the bar hooking up with this Rastafarian guy, this Jamaican guy.  She's rubbing his junk.  She's all over the sky, and I am just heartbroken.  And my confidence the entire week just went down the tubes, man.  It was traumatic.  Once you said you could forget about it, man.  Here's you.  Exactly.  The Jamaican Mike is. 
[02:18:30]  There she is.  I need that comparison again.  That's too good.  The white guy.  White guy in Jamaica.  And the guy that she was with at the bar.  Anthony. 
[02:19:00]  Yo.  How are you?  I was down in Jamaica a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  And there I am.  I hook up with these two girls, and I meet one of the guys from the entertainment guy of the resort I was at.  Uh-huh.  And we end up going back to their room, you know, having some fun with the girls.  I see this guy's hammer come out.  Yeah.  Biggest thing I have ever done.  It didn't get any bigger.  It was just, it was like down to like almost his knee. 
[02:19:30]  And the damn thing, it didn't get any bigger.  It didn't swell.  It just stood up.  Like a sleeping Doberman, you know, when they wake up and they just get up.  The damn thing just stood up and looked at me.  And I said, oh, my God, I had to get the hell out of there.  I lost it.  I walked out of the room.  See you later, precious.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  How's it going?  We're doing all right.  Yeah, I got a friend who's a waiter, and he's got a buddy at work, Jamaican guy.  He's got into a contest in his country for the biggest penis.  Okay.  They have these contests down there.  Oh, man.  I mean, if I go down there, I'll have to enter the women's competition.  And I'll probably lose. 
[02:20:30]  Thanks, guys.  Terrible.  Thank you.  Use it or lose it.  Damn.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Junkzilla.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You're going to make me drive off the road. 
[02:21:00]  I was down in Jamaica at one of these all-inclusive resorts.  And they had this guy, the body man, who took us all on a picnic.  There were five guys.  Five white guys.  A picnic man.  Yeah.  A picnic.  Or so we thought.  A picnic.  There were five white guys, five white girls, and the body man.  The body man.  He takes us out into the ocean, into, like, side-deep water.  And we start these drinking games with rum punch and everything. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, one thing leads to another, and everybody starts to get naked.  And, of course, what happens when white guys go in the ocean?  They get the turtle head.  So there are five of us standing there.  I've never been more humiliated in my life.  He takes down his shorts, and this thing is down, like, three-quarters of the way down his thigh.  He is a brown line of women waiting to get it on with him. 
[02:22:00]  The rest of us are standing there drinking rum punch.  That's great, man.  That's great.  Why the hell could you jump down there?  That's great.  Why would you take off your trunks, let's say, if you know you have a turtle head?  Biggest mistake of my life.  He said if you wanted to stay there, you had to take your shorts off.  Oh, yeah, sure.  It eliminates the competition.  Exactly.  That's their plan.  They get whitey down there, and they take advantage of you. 
[02:22:30]  You really ain't too, man.  That's what I did.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  God damn it, you guys are hilarious.  That is awful.  Mark.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Oh, man.  I went into the CVS, like, two weeks ago, and they said, oh, hey, your wife's got pictures.  Do you want to pick them up?  I said, yeah, sure.  What the heck?  She was down in Jamaica.  I'm in the car, man.  She's down there with her girlfriend. 
[02:23:00]  I got pictures of her, her girlfriend, and Long Dong Silver laying in the bed.  Laying in the bed?  Yeah.  I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this now?  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  I pulled the picture out.  She hasn't said anything.  I don't even know.  And I'm like, okay, fine.  Who took the damn picture?  You guys are killing us, man.  Maybe they had the camera set up on a tripod, and he just hit it with his slung.  I think he was holding it with the end of his slung, because I couldn't see the tip of it. 
[02:23:30]  Wow.  That's funny, Mark.  Dude, man.  It's the Jamaican Heart Lonely Club today.  You're killing us.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  God bless you, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, man.  Lewis.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Lewis?  Hey, man.  I went to Jamaica around two years ago, and I'm hooking up with this black Jamaican girl.  And she's telling me that I'm the first white guy she's ever had, right?  So bring her back to the hotel room.  And I'm around, like, seven inches.  So I'm like, you know, I think that I'm good and stuff. 
[02:24:00]  And I whip it out, and it's all ready.  I'm ready to go.  And she says, wait a minute.  You need some Viagra?  I got some Viagra in the back.  I'm like, what do you mean, Viagra?  I'm like, this is me, man.  What are you talking about?  She's like, no, no.  I got some Viagra.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Not big enough, Lewis.  Seven inches, man.  What the hell is up with you Jamaicans?  I'm rich, though, man.  All right.  You guys cool, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Better. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, man.  This is too fun for that.  It's awful.  Hey, Rod.  Yeah, guys.  What's happening?  How are you?  All right.  I'm doing good.  Hey, let me tell you something.  I was taking my girl down to Florida a couple weeks, and I figured I'd give her a little  special surprise, go over to Jamaica.  So I was going to go get the tickets this weekend.  Let me tell you something.  I got one thing to say to you, Tracy, because I know you're listening.  Disneyland.  We're going to Disneyland.  Disneyland.  You are not getting unleashed in the land of the Caribbean Cyclops.  There you go. 
[02:25:00]  There you go.  It's not happening.  Orlando, man.  That's it.  You are staying continental, baby.  I still love you, but, you know, we just got to make sure we keep hold of what we got.  Go to Jamaica now, fun, man.  Don't be scared.  All right, Rod.  All right, guys.  Be good.  Bye.  The closest she's going to get is Pirates of the Caribbean.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  And unlike Disney, it's not a small world in Jamaica, man. 
[02:25:30]  All right, man, we got to take a break.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great, man.  That's horrible, man.  Why would a guy go down there?  Why would a crazy white boy go down?  Oh, this guy.  Jamaica.  Hey, look at this clip.  I've seen this clip.  Oh, what's the, uh, oh, the guy that lifts stuff with his, uh, schlong.  Yeah.  The guy that looks weak.  I mean, I can understand you're a single guy, maybe.  You want to go down there and, uh, smoke more pot than you've ever smoked in your life. 
[02:26:00]  That's one thing.  But if you're, you got a chick and you go down there, you're insane.  Or if, uh, if you let your chick go down there alone or with one of her girlfriends.  Like, that's going to help.  Oh, she'll go with a girlfriend.  They'll protect each other.  No.  Skewered like shish kebab, the two of them.  Like a piece of beef and a pepper on a skewer.  That's it, man.  Uh, quick break and we'll be back.  H.O.P. 
[02:26:30]  Anthony.  107.  W.N.E.W.  My God.  We're hanging with Jim Brewer today.  Uh, I'm just starting to breathe again.  If you're tuning out during the commercials, you are just plain stupid at this point.  The best radio happening during the commercials.  You know what we learned, uh, today?  Part of it.  A little early. 
[02:27:00]  But, uh, we learned that there's now a third live read that people are going to be requesting.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter commercial with Jim Brewer.  We'll play that again tomorrow.  We have that.  What else do we have?  We have, uh, the Mujan hair remover.  The, uh, with, um, with Otto and George yesterday.  And then, of course, Jay Moore with the Rockaway Bedding.  Right.  Jim Brewer killing for us today.  Oh, you guys rock.  You make our job very easy.  Just turn on the mic and let Brewer go.  Ugh.  Even, ugh. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, JJ.  JJ.  Yeah, that was the funniest effing thing on New York radio ever.  What?  My sides are killing me now.  But the dog and the choking and...  Uh, everybody had an old, an old bra like that.  We used to call her Bagger in our town.  Bagger?  Yeah.  It was the funniest thing.  Brewer rules.  Screw that hook-nosed Jew.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Of course, he's referring to Ben Stein.  Ben Stein.  From Win Ben Stein's Money.  Yep.  In my neighborhood, we used to throw rockets at that lady. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, who didn't?  And Halloween was just, like, torture her night.  We had, uh, we had, um, this one German shepherd dog, and he lived this one house, and he,  they always leave him out, and he'd drive us nuts, and on the 4th of July, you know,  a lot of rockets right at him.  You get the drunk guy with roaming candles.  Where's the eppin' dog?  You can't feel the paint.  You can't feel the sparks.  Only the drunk dudes would grab the roaming candle. 
[02:28:30]  Grab the roaming candle.  Everybody else, you can't feel it.  His face is blistering.  What did it say on the instruction?  Place on ground, light views, get away.  You gotta shake it up.  You gotta shake it up.  Shake it up.  What do you got, fairies?  Come on.  Try an old one.  You know, I saw a roaming candle placed in the ground and lit, explode like a stick of  friggin' dynamite once.  And I'm thinking, oh my God, I'm always seeing people like you, Brewer says, holding these.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  And then, and then you get, like, the retarded.  It's like, one one's going up 100 feet, the other one's dribbling out on the guy's knuckles.  Open your head, Dick!  You got my foot, Dick!  Dick, give me the things.  You're done.  You're done.  Don't be a faggot.  Come on, man.  Then you had the idiot that would look into the tube because it didn't go off.  I thought there was another one in here.  Yeah, let me take a look. 
[02:29:30]  Let me take a look.  You just can't even pack 10 in here anymore.  That was always the thing.  When I go in and say, done, you go, effing chink.  Yeah, that's it.  Done.  Effing chink.  You light off like a pack of firecrackers and half of it would go off, the other was  strewn over with no fuses.  The chinks.  Freakin' chinks.  They can't get it right.  Once a year, we want to have fun with these things.  The friggin' chinks.  It's conspiracy.  It's the chinks.  They want it that way.  Give me money and they give us crap.  We just got to light them individually.  Give me your punk.  I remember trying to light firecrackers with a sparkler and you can't tell if they're 
[02:30:00]  lit.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's all sparkling together.  You're like, yeah.  Right up until it went in my hand.  Right.  I was like, oh my God, I can't feel my hand.  It was totally numb.  There's always one guy that spent like $40 on one.  Yeah, one thing.  Yo, let me see that one you got.  Let me see that one you got.  Oh God, I'll go get it.  40 bucks.  Don't tell my Mulder, man.  Oh my God, what is it, dude?  That's a thing, dude. 
[02:30:30]  I don't even know.  All I know is that it's serious crap.  It's like a Buick with a fuse in it.  Look, it's got wings.  You got to put it together.  You got to put it together.  That's all I need to say.  You got to put it together.  My brother came home from the Army.  He had his Army buddies visit him about a year or so later.  And they brought some goodies with him.  One was an M1 tank simulator. 
[02:31:00]  This thing simulated the blast of a tank shell hitting the ground.  What?  Without the shrapnel and whatnot.  This is unbelievable.  So it was a green canister with some military writing on it that unscrewed  and had a couple of contacts inside.  So I'm like, oh, let me go to the hardware store, grab some wire and a dry cell battery.  We'll go out to the John Glenn field out there and set this booger off, you know?  So I put it in the field.  I had like 50 feet of wire.  And you never realize how short 50 feet is until it's the only distance between you 
[02:31:30]  and something that explodes.  So I unroll it, and I'm looking.  I go, okay, well, it's a little closer than I would like to be.  But there's no shrapnel, you know?  So I'll attach one wire to the positive side of the dry cell.  I'll hook the other wire and then throw it on the contact and run away.  So by the time the igniter heats up or something, for that long haul the electricity's got to  make down 50 feet, oh, that could take nanoseconds. 
[02:32:00]  Gives me more than enough time to run.  To spin away.  Right.  Yeah.  No sooner did that wire brush the contact than I just saw a white light and got blown back  where the ground wasn't even under my feet anymore.  Like, you can't see it because it's radio.  I'm sorry.  But for you guys, I was like this in midair.  Like, my arms are straight out, my legs straight out, and I'm flying backwards.  I land on my ass, and now the flash was so bright, I heard my pupils slam shut. 
[02:32:30]  They were like, thwock, thwock.  And I couldn't see.  So I'm feeling myself, feeling, okay, fingers good, fingers there.  I'm feeling everything.  I swear to you, not a mark on me.  But the concussion from this thing, because there was no shrapnel, everything was right  there contained, no metal hitting me, but the blast, the frigging shockwave, it reminded  me of those scenes you see on Discovery of the house from the A-bomb, getting blown one 
[02:33:00]  way, and the trees snapping.  I swear, I got blown like 10 feet right on my ass.  I felt like the coyote.  I really did, man.  I knew how it felt.  And then afterwards, when you realize you're okay, it's like, dude, was that the coolest?  I thought I was dead, but now that I'm not, how cool is that?  Right.  That's funny.  Really, really sick.  All right.  Why'd they make it illegal? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, right?  It used to be so much fun.  John.  Yeah.  What's up?  Make my own pipe bomb.  Who on Long Island didn't have a buddy that made his own pipe bomb?  I got a bunch of M-80s, we'll just hollow out the side with a screwdriver, dump them in  the pipe.  You get all the duds in the next day.  Duds?  Yeah.  We'll make a genie.  Step on it, it explodes.  You get the lit genie and step on it in mid-spotulate.  Did you see it turned pink?  Did you see the pink color?  Thanks.  He's got the best genie. 
[02:34:00]  Case closed.  James Orville.  Might add pink in it, dick.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  May I help you?  Yes, butt plugs.  Who?  Butt plugs.  Butt plugs, yes, ma'am.  How can I help you?  Butt plugs.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Butt plugs.  A butt box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs. 
[02:34:30]  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  Butt?  Butt box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello?  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug.  What kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  No, butt plug.  I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  A butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Bug plug? 
[02:35:00]  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt plug.  What do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to figure...  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah, okay.  I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug. 
[02:35:30]  Butt?  Butt plug.  Oh, sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah, we don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right.  What the f*** was that? 
[02:36:00]  What the f*** was that?  Go F yourself.  Weed every day.  Go F yourself.  Weed every day.  Weed every day.  I'll beat up a check for you.  What?  Eh, eh.  Oh.  Eh, eh.  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it. 
[02:36:30]  Okay, watch this.  Stupid baby.  Get out of here, twat.  Stupid baby.  Stupid friggin' twat.  This is a turn-off.  Go for a pose.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  How'd you like to shut my ass?  Get in the coffin.  Howdy, maggot.  You son of a bitch.  Oh.  Why?  I just did it right.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.
