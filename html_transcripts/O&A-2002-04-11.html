<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a voicemail from an enraged listener unleashing a torrent of offensive language and violent threats.  The hosts responded with sarcastic self-deprecation, claiming a "mental capacity of an 18-year-old," and then provided phone numbers for listeners to call in.  A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the fallout from their commentary on Kathleen Turner's nudity in *The Graduate*.  A caller, Steve, graphically described the scene, prompting the hosts to suggest a listener heckle Turner to cover up. This led to angry calls and threats of legal action from Turner's representatives, including Ken Stevens, the general manager.  The hosts defended their actions as free speech, continuing with graphic descriptions of Turner's appearance and further humorous suggestions for audience disruption.  They then announced a new "fantasy girl" to replace Anna Kournikova, sparking a sexually explicit and offensive discussion about various celebrities' physical attributes, including a detailed, disparaging description of Kournikova's perceived poor imitation of a Marilyn Monroe scene.

The show shifted to a discussion of Mark Gastineau's emotional 48 Hours interview about his past domestic abuse. Listener calls followed, covering the Kathleen Turner controversy, Tiger Woods' new girlfriend, and Opie's fantasy girl selection, all punctuated by the hosts' crude and often racially charged humor.  A segment heavily featured listener calls detailing the reactions of white parents to their daughters dating Black men.  Callers shared anecdotes about familial disapproval, with discussions touching on concerns about sickle cell anemia, perceived commitment issues, and the use of interracial relationships as a status symbol among Black men.  The conversation meandered to other topics, including a listener's teenage dating experience, John Daly's alcoholism, speculation about nude photos of Tiger Woods' girlfriend, and the playing of Wesley Willis' music.  A strongly worded listener letter criticizing the show's content, particularly the "55-gallon drum challenge," was dismissed dismissively by the hosts.

Another segment opened with a discussion of the show's perceived influence, sparked by a letter from Brent criticizing the humor and suggesting a connection to the Columbine massacre. Opie vehemently denied this, launching into a tirade against Brent and blaming the parents of the Columbine shooters.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" and the "Hi Mom" bit (where a man calls his mother pretending to have been fired for masturbating at work) were discussed. The hosts defended themselves as "artists" and deflected responsibility for listener actions, responding to accusations of being "publicity whores" and mercenaries.  The conversation returned to Tiger Woods' new girlfriend (with photos promised online), Kreskin's stroke (also promised online), and the Kathleen Turner lawsuit. The contest related to the Turner incident was changed; instead of rewarding someone for yelling at her, the prize would go to the person who provided a ticket to *The Graduate*, preferably orchestra seating.  Comedian Dice called in for a rambling conversation, followed by an in-studio appearance by Paul Mercurio (from *The Daily Show*), with clips of his aggressive and insulting audience interactions.  Chloe Jones, an adult film star, and other women from the Privileged Gentleman's Club, then visited the studio, engaging in sexually explicit conversation with the hosts, including showing clips of Chloe's films. The show concluded with plugs for Mercurio and Jones' appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Message from, to, February, 10 at 6.57 p.m.  Hello, Glenn. I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this on to your general manager.  I'm wondering if someone's going to wait until someone goes in there and blows their head off of those pigs that work in your station.  They are disgusting pigs. Their mothers must be slapped in whores.  In order for them to go on the air and do the s*** that they do.  I am very sick of not being able to get in my car and my oxygen is the son of a b***h in space and fall into your pig-sized f***ing f***ing. 
[00:00:30]  And I have to hear a goddamn 60-year-old girl with a thousand goddamn stock rooms.  I have children who I'm trying to raise.  Now, if you guys don't stop it, I'm going to turn my f***ing life into the cause of busting your asses.  Now, please, Glenn, as you can see, I'm upset.  I'm a professional person. I've had children.  I'm not a wimp. I'm not a nerd.  And you can take your right to speak to shove it up their asses. 
[00:01:00]  You won't stop it because now you've gotten the very piss.  Now, please, forward the message.  Thank you.  Wow.  Great job, lady. We're still here.  What a b***h she was.  Someone requested that yesterday, so there you go.  That's like five years old. We're still in your face, lady.  Well, we, you know, we took a little break from Boston for a while.  Well, I think it's a calmer, gentler, Opie and Anthony, though. 
[00:01:30]  We've matured.  Oh, really?  We're maturing.  Yeah, I think we have the mental capacity of an 18-year-old now.  Right.  I got it.  And by accident, my radio goes to your effing station, she says.  Yeah, an accident.  Liar, liar, pants on fire, I say.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where is the...  Let's give out the phone numbers. 
[00:02:00]  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Where? Where?  Sacramento.  Sacramento.  They got WOW stickers in, and they're a hot commodity out there in Sacramento.  So, what's up, Sacramento?  You can use 866-277-4-WOW.  All right?  Roy, we've got to get right into the festivities today, Anthony, because we have a busy, busy show.  Oh, wait. Hold on.  Hot soup! 
[00:02:30]  Hot soup!  Hot soup!  Hot soup!  That's what I say!  Hot soup!  Yes, Dice.  Hot soup!  Hot soup, Dice.  Thank you, Dice.  Look what he's doing now.  Right.  You don't want to get me all started up over here, because everybody's like...  You're the one asking me to say, remember back then.  What?  I'm telling me to shut up, because you said who?  That's who? 
[00:03:00]  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hot soup!  Of course, hot soup.  The knucklehead is back.  We love the Dice Man on the O.P. Anthony show.  We really do.  When he comes up with something like hot soup, you've got to love him.  Hot soup.  Hot soup, Anthony.  Well, there's some controversy brewing with the O.P. Anthony show once again today. 
[00:03:30]  Yes, yes.  Some people a little upset with us.  Are they?  Oh, the dentist.  Relax.  It's not about you.  No.  Push a stop on your little recorder.  We're not going to talk about you today.  The dentist.  Anthony.  That kills me.  Ah.  It seems Kathleen Turner's people are very pissed off at you and I.  Yes, I did get wind of this.  I've been briefed. 
[00:04:00]  It seems that Kathleen Turner, who is on Broadway now, performing the role of Mrs. Robinson in  The Graduate, is a little annoyed with this program.  She's better suited to play Mr. Robinson.  Ah.  According to Steve from foundrymusic.com, who went and saw the play.  Yes, Steve saw it.  Steve did see the production.  And Steve was horrified by a naked Kathleen Turner.  She spends... 
[00:04:30]  Saying things like she looks like she could play for the Jets.  Yeah.  Big shoulders.  She spends about upwards of, you know, 16 to 20 seconds, I guess.  Completely nude.  Full frontal nudity.  Big, big 70s bush, is what Steve is saying.  Yeah, he said it looked like, kind of like a pool rack.  Yeah, pool rack.  I mean, it's that, it's like that big.  Go to your local billiard parlor.  Pick up a rack off one of the pool tables.  Fill it with hair from a barbershop. 
[00:05:00]  There you go.  That'll give you some image of what that might look like.  And, well, you know, no fault of her own.  She's no kid anymore.  You know?  Steve, hold on.  We're talking about you.  You don't even know.  She's not in the best of shape.  No.  From what I'm hearing from Steve.  Steve, you got us in trouble.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  You did nothing.  Yes, you did.  I was reporting.  Kathleen Turner's people very pissed off at Ant and I. 
[00:05:30]  We would have never talked about that stupid play, but you went and saw it.  And yelling phone calls is what I'm hearing.  Yelling.  Threatening to sue you and I.  Ken Stevens involved at some point.  He took the phone.  Super GM, Ken Stevens.  I'm really good.  Once again, sticking up for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Fighting the good fight behind the scenes.  Right.  I don't think there will be a Kathleen Turner PSA, Anthony.  No.  I think this time around, Ken did the right thing.  This, we got to give a little, maybe a little update to people what this involves. 
[00:06:00]  Steve saw the performance.  Yeah.  Saw Kathleen Turner.  Full frontal nudity.  On the stage.  The crowd very hushed at that moment, he said.  Very, very hushed, Opie.  I think he even said there were some gasps.  A couple of slights.  Like a little courtroom murmur kind of.  And then they all talked a little.  I talked a little bit of a reason.  Right.  And then she, I guess, walks off or puts something on or.  How did the nudity end? 
[00:06:30]  Nudity ends, I believe, with her walking back into the bathroom where she was.  Oh, so you got to see her ass, too?  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  And what was that like?  I think I'd rather see Steve's ass.  Thank you.  Oh, so our Steve is a thinner Steve.  Well, there's a thinner Steve.  It's not hairy.  It's.  It's.  All right.  And large and big.  Trunk-esque.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a big girl.  So using our freedom of speech, Anthony.  Right.  Let's hide behind that once again.  Let us pull up that wall. 
[00:07:00]  We'll pull up the freedom of speech wall.  We said that someone should tell Kathleen Turner to put her clothes on.  Yeah.  Because that's pretty much what a lot of the people in the audience want to tell her.  Oh, my God.  You're horrific naked.  Put your clothes back on.  So.  It felt like it's Alicia Silverstone naked on the stage.  No.  So perhaps we figured if there was an audience member sitting there that saw Kathleen Turner  naked during her little part of the play. 
[00:07:30]  And if this person felt like it.  Right.  And he had some balls.  He would have some balls.  He would stand up and tell her to put her clothes back on.  Stand up.  Put your clothes on.  Right.  That's pretty much all we really said.  That's great.  Because, I mean, wouldn't that just say it all, Opie?  Wouldn't that say it all?  And if it was a fan of this program, all the better.  All the better.  Just find a nice seat near the aisle.  Find a seat. 
[00:08:00]  You see Kathleen Turner.  She takes her clothes off.  We would love if somebody just stood up and yelled, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I would rather see Anne Bancroft today naked.  Right.  Than Kathleen Turner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess for some reason, it doesn't seem like it's believable that Jason Biggs playing the Dustin Hoffman role.  Right.  Would be falling for a big, fat, naked Kathleen Turner. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So now Kathleen Turner's people are up our ass.  And, of course, because of that, we have to go on the air now and say.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, I've got to get the statement from Ken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now.  Here it is, Anne.  I guess we have to put this out to the people.  Yes.  Go see The Graduate with Kathleen Turner. 
[00:09:00]  And, well, when she rips her clothes off, yell out, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  There you go.  Why?  Hey.  I do.  I don't care.  It'd be great.  I know Ken is listening.  Hey, man.  We tried.  What the hell?  Do it.  It'll be great.  It's a cute little statement you typed on your little typewriter.  But come on.  Goddamn.  Come on. 
[00:09:30]  And how could they sue us for saying that?  Oh, you can't.  You know something?  I know that the Constitution affords certain rights and freedoms of speech.  And it's always argued that you cannot go into a crowded theater.  The freedom of speech does not afford you the right to go into a crowded theater and yell fire.  You always hear that with the freedom of speech argument.  You cannot yell fire.  What you can do and are within your legal rights to do is yell, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Hey, you're just stating the obvious.  Right.  I'm not saying you might not get your ass thrown right the hell out of that theater. 
[00:10:00]  It's kind of like when you're at a baseball game and let's say Nomar Garciaparra hits a home run.  Nomar, put your goddamn clothes back on.  You can stand up and go, wow, what a hit.  They're just commenting about the event you're viewing.  Anthony?  Rick?  What are you saying?  What if you stand up in a crowded theater and yell, monster?  I don't know if that's legal.  Would that start the same panic as a fire?  Monster!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Dr. Jekyll's high. 
[00:10:30]  Ah!  You know, every performance, though, from now on, she's going to be wondering from that moment she drops her towel if tonight's the night.  Well, you know, you just never know.  They always used to complain, or they still do, people on Broadway, about those pesky cell phones ringing during their little...  Dialogue.  She will lose her mind.  Could you see one of our dopey-ass fans just standing there, standing up in a seat and going, 
[00:11:00]  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Now, this all started with an early morning phone call to Rick, our producer.  Rick, what was said to you over the phone by Kathleen Turner's people?  Well, first, they tag-teamed the poor guy, too.  There were two on the other line yelling and screaming at you, right?  Well, first, I thought, okay, somebody told them that you guys were talking about the show.  They want to book Kathleen Turner.  I'm thinking, all right, this could be cool.  Let her kind of defend herself, right?  Now, as soon as I called the guy back, he and Kathleen Turner's assistant get on the phone and just start railing me about, 
[00:11:30]  what do you guys think you're doing, having a contest, there's a law against this, we're going to get lawyers.  As soon as I started throwing lawyers and saying Washington, D.C., I said, you've got to talk to Ken Stevens.  Time to forward the call to Ken Stevens, the firefighter of the Opioid Anthem Show.  Exactly.  Putting out fires left and right.  Dave from Cleveland recommending that someone stand up and say, nice hair diaper.  That's a good one, too.  All right.  We'll go with that.  Thank you, Dave from Cleveland.  If you want to yell, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on or stand up and yell, nice hair diaper. 
[00:12:00]  Nice hair diaper?  You want to get the agent on the phone?  You think he'll talk today?  No, you belong in a dump in Staten Island.  It's a little long.  Yeah.  Why don't you call up the agent and see if he'll come on the air with us.  Yelling and screaming like a crazy man.  I hear she's not going to perform until this is taken care of.  And her understudy, DeVita, is going to be taking her place. 
[00:12:30]  Brother, brother, brother.  Very good.  Yeah.  So, wow.  What the hell's going to happen there?  You've got to figure every night now that part's going to come up and she's going to be like, oh boy.  Oh boy, is this the night?  Here comes the scene.  Is this the night?  I saw her on all the morning talk shows talking about this role and stuff.  And no one on the balls will say, it's a fabulous role for me. 
[00:13:00]  I adore doing stuff of this nature.  And John from D.C. saying, it's okay to yell monster in a theater when Kathleen Turner comes on stage naked.  And you're going to yell monster?  Is that the role?  All right.  We're just waiting.  Rick's calling the Kathleen Turner people.  Oh, really?  This should be extremely uncomfortable.  Oh, well, what happened to the phone there? 
[00:13:30]  Uh-oh.  There's a hangout.  Well, we'll get a report in a second here.  Rick, coming back into the studio.  All right.  He's out visiting a client right now, but I left him our number to call back.  I didn't call him back.  Because the ball's behind the scenes.  Oh, behind the scenes, there'll be all kinds of jockeying for position going on.  But you know something?  I would still love for someone to stand up and say, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Or just stand up and go, what the hell were you thinking? 
[00:14:00]  Or, sweet, merciful crap.  Or stand up and say, ha-choo!  That'd be a good one.  Yeah, stand up and say this.  Ha-choo!  That's what I say!  Ha-choo!  Could you imagine Kathleen Turner goes on stage, everyone, little hush comes to the crowd,  and all of a sudden you just hear, sweet, merciful crap! 
[00:14:30]  One thing I know, I don't want to hear any audience member yell, is it?  Hold a stink!  Hold a stink!  Oh, Anthony, we got audio of Kathleen Turner as the clothes hit the floor.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We have a law student on the line.  Yes, Phil. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, it's Phil.  Well, I'm a law student.  Sorry, Phil.  How you doing, Opie?  All right.  What's up?  Law student.  He's a scumbag in training, Opie.  Yes, I am, guys.  Listen, we're doing constitutional law right now, and we're dealing with the First Amendment.  I thought I'd give you a little help here.  Yeah.  The reason why you can't yell fire in a theater is that it presents a clear and present danger  to everybody in the audience.  I think we learned this in the third grade.  Yes, I know.  What I think is that Kathleen Turner herself taking off her clothes is a clear and present  danger, so I think you guys are all with the courts here. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Of course.  Just her doing it is a clear and present danger.  Someone's going to have a stroke viewing that.  I know.  Definitely.  Oh, no, we have a clip of somebody in the audience, and it goes, hush, Kathleen Turner  is standing naked on stage, and all you hear, blurted out from one seat.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Oh, no.  I thought I had the audio of the audience member, eh?  Ah!  Ah!  Remember, you're a drag queen! 
[00:16:00]  Not many people know, Ant.  I went and saw The Graduate.  You did?  The other day.  Ah!  I didn't want to tell you, but now that Kathleen Turner's people are threatening to sue us  and stuff.  Yeah.  Well, when that moment happened, I taped myself.  Uh-huh.  Ah!  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  They're all pink on the inside.  Well, some more than others.  Yeah.  Some have a little purple with the pink.  Ah!  A little brown.  A little brown.  A little brown.  A little gristle.  You know, when you get that one bad clam.  All the others are nice and tight and pink and stuff.  And you're like, hmm, this is nice.  And you get that one, oof.  Tastes bad.  Looks bad.  Ah!  Poof!  Half the clam is, you know, falling out of the shell. 
[00:17:00]  And the edges are all brown on the clam.  And it's just hanging out like a tongue sticking out of a mouth.  We're talking about clams.  Yeah.  And it stinks.  Yeah.  No!  No!  Yeah.  All right.  Ah!  Poof!  Brett, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey, Brett.  What's up?  I think somebody should get in there and say, hey, what's that string?  Hey, what's that string?  Yeah.  Hey, what's that string?  All right.  Kathleen Turner. 
[00:17:30]  We got a tape of her sounding a little confused during her nude scene.  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Somebody in the front row.  Let's go to Graham.  Graham, what's going on?  What's up, guy?  You guys suck so bad.  Why?  I've been trying all week to get out of having to go see this piece of crap this Saturday  night, and now I've got to sit with this ammo in the back of my mind.  There you go.  You're going to be giggling like a little schoolgirl when the clothes hit the stage. 
[00:18:00]  You don't understand.  I'm going to the Met game before that.  Really?  I'm going to be drinking.  I don't want to be there.  It's with clients and my wife's.  The best way to get out of it, I can think of, is to have someone yank me out of there  for saying something along the lines, put your clothes on, you fat bitch.  Right.  Right.  Hey.  He's laughing.  I hear him laughing.  It's not funny.  It's going to happen.  There's no way out of it.  I'm going to have to do it.  Wow.  The power. 
[00:18:30]  Also.  Yes.  Yes.  Can't legally you get out of trouble if you say, in my opinion, before you bash this chick?  I guess.  I mean, First Amendment law students should know if you say, in my opinion, you can't be  held responsible.  We're just speaking our minds.  I don't want to see Kathleen Turner naked ever.  No.  Ever.  No.  And I don't think it's believable that Jason Biggs is supposed to, you know, get turned  on by the linebacker as she takes her clothes on.  She hasn't been good since that baby movie a couple years ago with the two little kids 
[00:19:00]  that were talking.  And, you know, I'm going to have to do what I got to do.  I'm sorry.  You might read about it.  All right.  And then our people get involved and they want to sue us to state our opinion.  Stop it.  You know, one of the things I read in the playbill as I'm waiting for this play to start  is that she was given the option not to do the nude scene at all.  Oh, but it's now time.  Now it's a freeing experience.  So she was told that she didn't have to do it, apparently, by the director of The Graduate,  but she said it was the part dictated that she got. 
[00:19:30]  Dictated.  She got completely naked.  Why couldn't she get naked in front of, like, a funhouse mirror?  Maybe that'll help.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All right.  So we'll have to wait and see how this plays out.  But, you know, if the Kathleen Turner people want to get on the show today, we would love  to have you.  All right?  Let the clam hit the floor.  Let the clam hit the floor.  Little droopah.  And there's someone in the front row as Kathleen Turner disrobes.  It's coming right for us. 
[00:20:00]  You've got to watch out.  All right.  Something else really fast.  Yeah.  Before we take our first break, Ant, I have an announcement to make.  I am switching fantasy girls.  Oh.  Now, who was your previous fantasy girl?  I went from Drew Barrymore.  Yeah.  Which, uh...  Ragged around the edges.  Yeah.  You guys didn't like my choice way back when.  A little sloppy.  Well, I like the skank in her.  You know what I mean?  A little skank.  I like a little skank with my fantasy girl.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:20:30]  And then I went with the obvious Anna Kornikova, like so many other people.  Right.  Anna Kornikova is over in my mind.  You know what really, really clinched the Anna Kornikova?  The Kornikova thing being over for me.  Reading the story about the video that she made with Enrique where she had cold sores?  No.  Really?  That did it for me.  Get that story.  Where's that?  I didn't even see that.  That, that...  Yeah, that...  It was a commercial or for the...  This is months ago.  Yeah.  I didn't hear about that.  Oh, that totally did it for me.  No.  You don't want to know your fantasy girl gets cold sores and pimples and stuff. 
[00:21:00]  You want them perfect at all times.  My, uh...  The thing that put me over, uh, her, was that commercial where she's supposed to do the Marilyn  Monroe thing over the grate and the air blows up.  We all remember the Marilyn Monroe scene.  She's over the grate.  The wind blows up from one of the subway grates and her dress blows up and she's very, very  cute trying to hold it down.  She puts a little devilish grin on and whatnot.  They tried to reenact that using Anna Kornikova.  So she walks over the grate. 
[00:21:30]  The air blows.  She turns around, squats, and puts her hands on her knees.  And instead of looking cute and, and kind of, you know, dirty and evil and devilish like  Marilyn Monroe did, it looked like she was taking a dump.  Yes.  She looked like she was squatting to take a dump.  There was nothing sexy about it.  And taking a dump in, yeah, in not a sexy style.  No.  Some girls...  Is there a sexy style that girls take dumps in, Opie?  Some girls could at least...  Comment.  Some girls could at least make that position look sexy, yes.  Really?  What about those ads for, uh, uh, help me out somebody, the, the candy shoes or the candy 
[00:22:00]  underwear or whatever it was.  Yes.  And they had the girls, uh, on the, on the, uh, toilet with the, the panties down, uh, you  know...  Around their ankles.  All right.  But you're not seeing the whole...  Sexy in a weird way.  Mm-hmm.  But how she did it, I, I, I assume that's how a, a plumber takes a dump.  Yeah.  She was just like, just to see her, all you needed was a, a grunt, a dump grunt.  And someone had to sign off for that and say, yeah, she looked real sexy doing the Marilyn 
[00:22:30]  Monroe thing.  I mean, you look at the...  I so agree with you.  I saw her and I was like, ugh.  It was awful.  You remember the pictures of her in Rolling Stone dressed all in that red stuff and lounged  out legs for a mile long and everything.  And that was all hot and everything.  And, and now you see her over that grate and taking a dump, a plumber's dump.  It's just...  She, uh, ain't working anymore.  She is so over, Anthony.  Yeah.  So I want to announce my new fantasy girl.  Your new fantasy girl.  Oh.  Oh.  Maybe people can try to guess. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  We got something to give away?  Yeah.  Tons of stuff.  New fantasy girl.  No.  See, Dama from, uh, New York.  He's already...  Florida Evans, Opie.  Um, no.  No.  And it's not Kathleen Turner.  No, it's not Florida Evans.  That was before...  Yeah.  Uh, I, I got my eyes done from the, the good doctor, Dr. Philotoff.  Brand new fantasy girl.  Uh, I know who it is.  Starts with a D, ends with an A.  DeVita.  No. 
[00:23:30]  No.  We already did today's DeVita joke.  I know, but two in one day, even better.  More gooder than one DeVita reference.  All right.  Well, we'll have people guess.  Because I'm sure they'll have fun as I go into the barrel, obviously.  There you go.  Hey, do we have that Florida thing we can play going into break?  No, don't use that.  I need...  I'm going for that reference.  Oh, perish the thought.  Four days in a row.  I'll make five.  I got to make sure it makes sense, though, Rick.  Do it, can I, can we play that, uh... 
[00:24:00]  Oh, do we have the short version, though?  Short version.  You know what?  We'll do it after commercial.  I know where it is.  Uh-huh.  It's in my desk.  And no, it isn't my mom.  All right, guess my new fantasy girl.  Yeah.  Do you have a fantasy girl in?  Um, no, because when the, uh, when the, uh, Anna Kornikova thing was over, I really didn't  have anybody to fall in.  So you haven't replaced?  Fall into place.  Even those nude shots of Jennifer Connelly didn't do it?  No, the old Jennifer Connelly shots were great.  We were looking at nude celebrity sites yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  Show prep.  And, uh, she almost became my new fantasy girl.  There's a shot of her, um, on a beach or something, looking just hot.  And then she's in front of a mirror from a movie.  Was it Mulholland Drive?  Uh, I can't remember.  But she was, that was her perfect point.  Now she's all bony and anorexic and stuff, like at the awards.  And, uh, this, though, she was the perfect, perfect body for her.  By the way, just like the Miss America pageant, I do have a backup in case something happens 
[00:25:00]  to my brand new fantasy girl.  Yeah, but first runner up.  First runner up.  It's the chick that is featured on the latest Stuff Magazine cover.  Holy mother of God.  Sophia Vergara.  No, J.K. from Hoboken.  Her name is not Beth.  No, we've been hot chicks.  You people are just a bit much.  Well, if someone gets it, we'll, uh, we'll give you a prize.  Whatever, and we'll have fun with it.  But this chick that's on the latest issue of Stuff Magazine, Sophia, is just beyond ridiculous. 
[00:25:30]  If you're walking by a newsstand, check it out.  The pictures of her in here are unbelievable.  The woman whose cancerous breast was brought in the other day.  No!  See?  You people are jackass.  All right, we'll go to the phones next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted who's only pretending  to be interested in who I am and what I think so he can get into my scale.  Dirty girls need love, too.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  You know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around here?  Anthony.  Executioners with Linkin Park.  It's going down.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, we're doing a stupid little thing right now.  I know it's stupid.  We've got some prizes to give away.  I'm announcing that I have a new fantasy girl replacing Anna Kornikova, Anthony.  It's about time.  Yes.  Now, people want to guess who it is, Ant.  I think it's very obvious, by the way. 
[00:26:30]  You do?  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to the phones.  Let's see.  This looks like Davida.  What's up, guys?  It's Davida.  Hey, Davida.  What's going on?  Hey, Opie, am I your fantasy?  You're my fantasy, man.  Just picture it.  Me, you, naked in a bed, and me tussling those delicious, juicy, blonde locks of yours.  No, Davida.  It's not you.  Opie, I am all the man, I mean woman, you need. 
[00:27:00]  No, Davida.  I'm sorry.  It's not you.  Later.  Hey, you think I can get dicey?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, now.  My bad.  I'll bring some heat later in the show, baby.  I hope I don't burn out my character.  Yeah, don't burn out your character.  You're on the air for 30 seconds.  That's good.  All right.  Later.  You're like a 30-second character.  Right.  Dice, unfortunately, is a 40-minute character when he calls.  Don't burn yourself out.  All right.  No, it's not Davida, Anthony.  No.  Let's go to Dave. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, Dave.  What's going on, man?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I know, I hope he likes some vodka, and he likes him pregnant.  I'd say a seven-month pregnant Beyonce from the best of his job.  I don't find anything attractive about that girl.  You don't like Beyonce?  I think the other black lady in Destiny's Child, much hotter.  Really?  Much hotter.  I'm trying to figure out which one.  With the short.  She had the short black hair for a while.  Really?  I swear. 
[00:28:00]  You think Beyonce or whatever her name is hot?  I think she's the hottest one in the band.  She's got huge ass and huge wide thighs.  She's not ready for the job.  Yo, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ken Stevens had Kathleen Turner's people in, and he didn't sell them advertising?  That's good.  That is good.  Very good, bro.  All right, I've got listeners.  Go listen to Get It 105.  Thanks.  Which one, Opie?  The one on the right.  The one all the way on the right.  I swear to you.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even making it.  She's the manliest one in Destiny's Child. 
[00:28:30]  She's not manly.  Absolutely is.  Turn it around.  Hold on.  Let me get another gallery shot up here.  I'll get one shot of just her.  She's the hottest in the band.  I'm telling you.  I don't think any one of them is spectacular.  You think she's the hottest one?  She's hotter than Beyonce.  You absolutely think?  I don't know.  Yeah, definitely.  She's the darkest.  And I like them dark.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Chris. 
[00:29:00]  Yo.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Opie, you said you like a little skanky woman, right?  Yeah.  Nobody's skankier than Lisa Orbeck.  Oh, stop it.  There's no one there.  You're getting her confused with Laura.  Laura.  Laura's the skanky one.  Oh, man.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  No, Laura's not my fantasy girl.  Go ahead, Jim.  I'm going to say Tara Reade.  Now, you know something?  Tara Reade is so close to being just a dream girl. 
[00:29:30]  One of those really hot-looking girls.  There's a couple of things going on with her that ain't quite right.  When you talk about a fantasy girl,  I mean, they've got to be perfect.  Well, she partied at Lizzie Grubman,  so we know she knows how to friggin' drink.  Tara Reade, she needs her boobs a little bigger.  She's in the new movie, what?  The Val Kilmer movie?  Or Van Halen?  Whatever the hell that friggin' thing's called?  Let me tell you,  if Kate Hudson had bigger boobs,  she would, without a doubt, be my fantasy girl.  I've seen some nudes of her, too.  She's been in our studio.  She's an angel on Earth.  I mean, she's unbelievable. 
[00:30:00]  Really?  But as far as, like, a fantasy girl,  she needs the boobs.  It's not the obvious Britney Spears?  No.  It's too obvious.  Yeah.  All right, then I guess Jay Moore's out.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Let's go to Jared.  What's up, Jared?  Yeah, is your new fantasy girl Esther Rolle?  No.  We're going to play that bit in a second here, though, but no.  You know, from The Good Times?  I got you.  I know you like the African princesses.  All right, all right, all right.  Thank you.  Andrew from Cleveland, what's going on? 
[00:30:30]  Andrew?  I think 2002, SI issue.  Chi Chi Rodriguez's wife.  And I know who Anthony's is, too, man.  You can't decide between which Olsen twins.  Yeah, the Olsen twins, right.  Very nice.  But you know what?  Andrew is the closest.  Closest, Anthony.  Oh, oh.  A little hint there.  It's not Jessica Alba.  It's not Katie Holmes.  Even though Katie Holmes as a lesbian in that HBO show was beyond hot. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give me that.  Shakira, no.  Oh, whoa, this guy's close.  Nick from Philly, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Is it the breastfeeding mom?  No.  Mama, I want ninny.  You're not too old.  Mama, I want ninny.  All right, guys, you guys are up.  All right, we promised, by the way, no more four-year-olds breastfeeding on our show.  No.  We're done with that.  We got over that. 
[00:31:30]  Quickly, thank God.  Don from East Meadow writes, is it Karen the anal monster from Buffalo?  All right, see, look who you're picking.  It's like they got to film her in negative just so you could see her.  From Destiny's Child.  She's a little darker than Beyonce.  Wow.  I don't know, though.  I'm not saying she's a knockout gorgeous, but I'm saying out of those three girls, I think  she's the hottest.  Yeah.  As far as the full package goes.  You just want them wild.  That's right.  Unbroke.  That's right. 
[00:32:00]  It's not Lillian Garcia from the WWF.  It's not Sheryl Crow.  It's not Bea Arthur.  It's not Star Jones.  It's not Kelly Ripa.  It's not Mandy Moore.  Wow.  It's not Natalie Imbruglia.  It's Imbruglia.  It's a little more obscure than I think you're giving people credit for.  I'll be like, it's kind of, it's not something that is just out there all the time.  Do you people read?  Come on now.  Slow down. 
[00:32:30]  Slow down.  All right, and my new fantasy girl, because no one's going to get it.  No.  Tiger Woods' girlfriend.  Holy S.  Tiger Woods' God.  His new girlfriend.  There's a picture of her in, what, the Post today?  Ellen Nordegrin.  Page seven of the New York Post.  Oh my God.  Perfect.  She's the whitest woman on the face of the earth.  Perfect.  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  Big boobs, tall.  Tiger takes after O.J. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, Tiger, you need any pointers on how to cut her blonde head off?  Just call up to O.J.  And you know I don't ask the listeners for much.  Yeah.  I really don't.  I'm begging you guys, as many pictures as you could find of her, can you please send them in to me?  We did a quick search and we found about four or five and they're un-effing believable.  I guess she did some model shots recently.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Well, people now are saying Tiger Woods' girlfriend? 
[00:33:30]  Of course.  Jackass.  No, not Kathleen Turner.  But she's unbelievable.  Maybe Steve could link her picture up on our website, foundyourmusic.com.  She is just one of those blonde, Nordic, very attractive model girls.  And there's Tiger.  Oh, brother.  Oh, geez.  Whoa, what's wrong?  Well, I just, I see the sisters getting a little angry at this. 
[00:34:00]  See, some of the sisters may be getting a little angry.  Because you know how the sisters don't like when the successful men of color go after the white broads.  They don't like it.  They get angry.  Tiger's very black, though.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's got more of that Asian thing in him.  Really?  Yeah.  His mom's like Korean or something.  You see his dad?  Taiwanese.  I don't know.  His dad is all black. 
[00:34:30]  His dad got a little white blood in him.  You think?  A little bit.  A little bit.  When you talk black, you talk about Bruce Smith, Mickey Rivers.  That's black, my friends.  Yeah.  Rondell White.  Wow.  Well, good luck, Tiger.  Wait, Tom is going to dispute my fantasy girl already.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I've seen a picture of that chick in the globe.  She is hot.  But that picture today in the paper does no justice because she's got messed up teeth. 
[00:35:00]  Look at it.  Like really yellow and she's got a big gap in her teeth.  See, I'm looking at her teeth.  I'm looking at her teeth right now.  No one has yellow.  She has perfect teeth.  Black and white.  Dude, dude.  Dude, no one has yellow teeth when you're that hot.  No, I'm telling you, he's not perfect, Ben.  He's not.  He's dating a freaking half nigger, half chick.  Oh, Jesus.  We don't like that.  That's why he's angry.  See?  We don't like that.  Along with the sisters being angry, Opie, a lot of white guys get a little uptight about 
[00:35:30]  this, too.  Now, someone is telling me that she has a twin sister and they're not joking.  Really?  Oh, no joke here.  She has a twin sister.  That's Paul E. from Lawrence, who has never lied to us as far as this radio show goes.  Oh, yeah.  Michael's got it.  Uh, Michael.  Hey, Opie.  How you doing?  All right, bro.  That's Parnivik's nanny.  Yeah.  That's how Tiger met her.  Yeah, the PGA golfer that wears the funny hat.  Yeah.  Right.  Where he has to flip the lid up high.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Straight from Sweden, man.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:36:00]  And, uh, she was his nanny and then Tiger, uh...  Well, he's friends with her and he went over the house a couple of times and then, you  know...  I bet.  Oh, by the way, people are starting to send me pictures of Tiger's old girlfriend.  Yeah.  It looks just like her.  No, not at all.  Or close to it.  No.  She's like a five.  The new one's a ten.  That's not the one I'm into.  Oh, people.  A buddy of mine's down in Augusta.  Yeah.  For the masters.  Pretty nice, dude.  And he saw her live and said she's phenomenal.  You can tell.  I mean, they just snapped a picture.  It's in the post today.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:36:30]  Like a Barbie doll.  There you go.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Al Florentine.  All right.  Sounds just like it, doesn't it?  All right, Dan.  Do we really want to do this with Gastineau?  Oh, God, was this painful.  We have a few more minutes left here.  This was just painful to watch.  What was it, 2020?  48 Hours.  48 Hours.  Whatever.  Whatever.  They're all the same shows.  I'm sure they love that.  I'm just like, what?  What is that, 2020?  Oh, we promo it. 
[00:37:00]  We air it.  And you still get it wrong.  Oh, what do I know?  Whatever.  48 Hours.  One of those shows.  And they were talking with Mark Gastineau.  You remember him.  New York Jets.  He was part of that devastating line.  Oh, what was that?  The New York SAC Exchange?  The New York SAC Exchange.  And, well, he came about some bad times.  You know what?  Tiger Woods is doing something with his new chick already.  He's making her wear coats and stuff to cover up that unbelievable body. 
[00:37:30]  So there's no distractions when he's playing golf.  Are those brand new pictures from the Masters?  I just got...  This is a brand new picture of her.  Tiger Woods girlfriend, Ellen Nordgren, follows him during first round play in the 2002 Masters  played at the Augusta National Golf Club, April 11, 2002.  That's the latest picture of her right there, Anthony, on the Internet.  Here it goes.  This girl will...  There's going to be so many pictures of her.  She's going to explode all over the Internet. 
[00:38:00]  You watch.  You watch.  That's the old girlfriend.  Stop sending the old girlfriend.  Anyway.  Tiger Woods.  Oh, he got a piece of ass there.  Everyone is sending the old girlfriend who also has blonde hair, but she has beady eyes that are too close together.  That's not the one I'm looking at.  We're looking for her, the Nordic guy.  Beady eyes.  Look at that.  Look at that picture right there, Anthony.  That's something.  There you go.  All right.  Anyway, you were saying about Mark Gastineau.  Oh, yeah.  Poor Mark Gastineau. 
[00:38:30]  You know, he fell on some bad times because...  Well, first of all, he beats women.  He liked beating women.  And it cost him some money.  He had trouble with, what, alcohol and drugs.  Just turned into a big mess.  He went to jail for it, didn't he?  Went to jail for domestic abuse.  He was beating his girlfriends, his wife.  And he went to jail.  Yeah, he went to jail for it.  It's not like he just started beating women.  They put him in some kind of an anger management program and, I don't know, he just turned into a mess. 
[00:39:00]  Well, they interview him.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy ass.  The pictures they're coming up with.  Our listeners rock.  My new screensaver.  Thank you.  Wow.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So they were talking to him.  They were interviewing him.  And he's talking about how, you know, he turned to the Bible.  And, oh, it's just awful.  But, Opie, the tragic moment of this whole thing when he broke down. 
[00:39:30]  He broke down and started crying.  There's big, big, mongoloid-headed Marques.  No.  Just crying.  His lips are trembling all over the place.  Guys hate seeing other guys cry, though.  He's contorting his face.  He's like, just crying.  I hate seeing guys cry.  Oh, don't do that on TV.  You know, don't do it on TV.  You want to hear Mark Gastineau crying? 
[00:40:00]  Here we go.  You are a big man.  What would make you hit a woman?  What came over you?  Me wanting my wife, girlfriend to be submissive to me in the world.  He says he's begun to understand his violent behavior thanks to a newfound faith and a counseling program for batterers.  This is a Mark Gastineau you've never seen.  It says that you have attended 26 sessions of alternative to violence program. 
[00:40:30]  And it means a lot to you, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  Don't want things I have.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, God.  Why would he go on national TV and cry like that?  Don't you do it!  Don't you! 
[00:41:00]  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, that's horrible!  God, that is awful!  Isn't that the worst?  I couldn't even look at the TV and it was so uncomfortable.  Yeah, we don't need to see that.  Growing up a Jet fan and what he did on the football field and to see what he has become?  Oh, awful. 
[00:41:30]  You remember, you know...  Is he going to start apologizing for all the sacks he did on the field?  God, I'm sorry.  And I hit him and the ball popped out of his hands.  He fumbled.  I want to apologize to every quarterback I knocked down.  I'm so sorry.  It was something in me.  I didn't mean to end your career. 
[00:42:00]  I'm so sorry.  Oh, well.  There you go.  Hey, Anthony, by the way, I'm not the only one.  No, no.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Which one?  No, don't do that to us today!  You asses.  Oh, bastard.  There's a way to get out of that without having to shut the computer down, yeah.  Somebody sent me the never-ending windows popping up of a man holding open the balloon knot. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, where you could fit a softball.  You bastard.  I'm glad I didn't click on that.  What was the link?  No, but...  It was...  But before that, someone...  I mean, there are a ton of people already on to what I'm saying here today, Anthony.  Yeah.  There is someone pretty much just following her around in Augusta today.  Uh-huh.  They had a picture of her on the second hole watching Tiger.  Now we're up to a picture of her on the fifth hole watching Tiger.  Oh, really?  And they're just exploding all over the internet already.  Yeah.  Here's Tiger Woods' girlfriend on the fifth hole. 
[00:43:00]  Like, the picture of her on the second hole wasn't good enough.  Oh, the second hole.  Something bad.  All right, why don't we break here?  That was the only clip we had of him crying?  Damn.  Huh?  No, that was it.  That was it?  Yeah, it was just a quick little thing.  Gas and no crying.  What are you going to do with it?  All right.  You know.  It's the new Opie and Anthony show where we don't beat things into the ground for an  hour and a half.  I don't know if I like that part of the show.  Really?  Where we don't beat things into the ground. 
[00:43:30]  That means we have to come up with more stuff.  It's a challenge for us.  As we're downloading pictures.  No, that's the beady-eyed one.  They keep sending the beady-eyed ones.  Stupid people.  Anthony, we found something from the Oney Archives here.  Haven't played this in a really long time.  Talking about fantasy women and stuff.  I made a big slip up a few years back, a couple of years ago, when I said I loved Florida  from Good Times.  Yeah, yeah.  When I meant to say Thelma. 
[00:44:00]  You meant to say Thelma, the daughter.  The daughter.  She was in Playboy when I was just a little, little kid.  Yeah.  And I stole the Playboy with her in it.  You know, the sister.  With her in it.  With her looking all black and stuff and naked.  It was really hot.  And I was trying to tell the story on the air and I slipped and I said Florida instead  of Thelma.  Yeah, you certainly did.  Check this out.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Thelma, Thelma, Thelma.  Thelma.  Thelma.  Thelma.  No, no, no, no.  Showing out the camera in her teeth. 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no.  James, Ope is looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs stable to the back of my neck.  James.  Where's JJ?  Thelma.  You said Florida.  Everyone heard it.  Ope had the hots for Florida.  I don't know when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Ope.  Come here, give me some love.  Little brown shook, Ope. 
[00:45:00]  James.  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man.  Yeah.  How about that Anesta, Ope?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen.  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking, wow, what  a hot babe. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup.  Oh, man.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Ope, hots for Florida from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Ope's personal collection.  The one with Florida.  James, I'm naked in Playboy.  All right.  Son of a...  James! 
[00:46:00]  Now, J.J., I have company this evening.  Ope is coming over.  After James got killed, remember that?  She would have liked a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have fit good in the projects.  All right.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother.  Yes.  Yes.  Remember how angry he was.  That's right.  I don't think Ope would have cut the monster.  Michael.  His hair and everything. 
[00:46:30]  Mama?  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let Mama go out with Ope.  James!  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he sure is the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Of course he can't stack up to James, Larry Count. 
[00:47:00]  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun ever.  I always thought it was fun to pick on people.  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here.  I listen to the Ope and Anthony.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here.  I listen to the Ope and Anthony.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here and I listen to the Ope and Anthony show every day.  Yeah, right.  The Ope and Anthony show. 
[00:47:30]  1027 WNEW.  An ambitious attorney.  Call the court and tell them that I'm on my way, all right?  Okay.  Okay, tell them I'm on.  Nice one, Ben.  We're back with the Ope and Anthony show.  First technical problem we've had in months.  There goes your record.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Cleveland.  Jim Norton playing there tomorrow night.  I think he's flying today and maybe we'll get him on the show a little later. 
[00:48:00]  866-277-4WOW if you're outside the New York area.  I want to thank something real quick.  I bet he has a problem with this flight.  Of course.  And his hotel room.  Of course.  He'll have many problems.  I want to thank the listeners.  They're sending in pictures like crazy of Tiger Woods' new girlfriend.  Not the old girlfriend with the beady eyes that are too close together.  The Nordic god.  Well, we've seen some of the pictures of her and her twin sister now, too. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, because Paul from Lawrence goes, dude, I'm telling you, I'm not lying.  She has a twin sister.  It has been confirmed because we found another website with the twins posing together.  This girl is ridiculous.  Steve is getting all the links and he's putting it up on foundrymusic.com.  So, Super GM Ken Stevens just walked in and said, she's nearly perfect.  Ah, nearly?  She's nearly perfect.  Nearly perfect.  I want to ask Ken what the flaw is in this girl because I can't find one.  Why?  Even the space between the teeth is sexy in a way. 
[00:49:00]  And you know what's funny?  Now they've got pictures of her on the sixth hole watching Tiger Woods.  Well, that's what they're doing, hole by hole.  Hole by hole, they're getting pictures of Tiger Woods' new girlfriend and they're putting them up on the Internet.  So, we're finding some really, really hot websites with this girl all over it.  Hey, there's a sister on the line.  Let's go to, what, Marcy?  Yes, how you doing, guys?  What's up, Marcy?  What's up?  You know, you don't mind, Tiger? 
[00:49:30]  No, no.  Hold on, there's a technical problem due to Tiger's chick.  That was a technical problem.  Oh, that's why?  Yeah.  That's why you effed up, Ben?  Ben, usually very focused when we're in here, Anthony?  Yeah.  He lost his effing mind and coming back into the show, we're playing music, commercials, sweepers all at the same time because he's too busy checking out Tiger Woods' girlfriend.  Oh, I know.  Go ahead, Marcy.  Like I said, if I found a white guy that could do me and he was successful, like Tiger Woods or Ben Affleck and he's hot, hell yeah, I'm going to do it. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah?  If he can satisfy me physically and emotionally and financially, hell yeah.  And he has the benefits?  I got benefits.  No, please, Steve, Whitney, I have my own benefit.  Yeah, baby.  I have my own benefit.  I'm an independent sister.  So, basically, you're saying you'd go out with a white guy?  Yes, I would.  I mean, I've taken a lot of, and I have, and I've taken a lot of grief for it because, I mean, hell, you know how it is, but. 
[00:50:30]  That means you're black, black.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Don't curse there, Marcy.  Now, the thing is, don't allow the sisters, they don't like it when a guy of color is going out with a white chick.  You know?  That's pretty much uneducated ignorance, I think.  Ignat.  Ignat.  Yeah, you ignorant.  Ignat. 
[00:51:00]  That's pretty ignorant.  I mean, um.  Marcy, how would you, why would you take a guy that's not hot just because he's black and then you find this hot white guy and you don't, you don't do it.  But the sisters think that a black guy should leave, uh, you know, take his success into the community and find himself a girl there.  I mean, in all honesty, you're trying to get out of the freaking community.  Why go back and get some cheese, some cash?  You don't agree with the, I gots to give a little back?  No. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, donate.  Do charity.  Give to the local daycare center or whatever.  But get your chicks outside the crack house.  Leave them there.  Leave them where you find them.  Marcy, uh, where are you calling from?  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  And how black are you?  I'm very black.  Yeah.  But how black?  I'm not very dark.  No, I'm not very dark.  Beyonce black or the one that Opie likes black?  No, I'm.  Halle Berry black?  Or Halle Berry black.  Or Florida black.  Black black.  Definitely not Florida.  Lou Gossett Jr.?  Definitely not Florida. 
[00:52:00]  No?  No.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling.  You guys rock.  Thank you, baby.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Andrew has found a flaw in Tiger Woods' new girlfriend.  Oh.  Andrew, I didn't think there was a flaw.  What have you found?  Uh, she's dating a black guy.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  People.  Andrew.  Wow.  We're all just trying to get along here.  Damn.  Diane.  Yeah.  Another black sister.  What's up?  I'm not in your demographic.  I'm 32. 
[00:52:30]  I'm professional.  I'm driving out the street.  And I just want to let you know that good times thing that you do is the funniest thing  I have ever heard.  You like the good times?  That is hilarious.  More.  We need more blackists.  I admit that I listened to you guys.  I did the Arbitron ratings thing a couple weeks ago.  And I was afraid to put the station down.  I don't like that you use the N word.  I don't like that word.  Oh, no.  I know you guys are funny.  I know you guys are racist.  But some of the people that call in, I wonder if they're serious.  But you guys don't know.  You can plan around. 
[00:53:00]  Diane, I can say that they're serious.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, they're serious.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It's bad.  But that's the way it goes, I guess.  This show has a lot of flaws.  I'm not going to fake it.  These guys call in and they're serious.  Yeah, I know.  But we're learning we can say the N word as long as it's GGA.  Yeah, sure.  I don't like anybody saying it.  I don't care what color they are.  No, GGA is okay at the end.  No, it's not okay.  You're saying that's okay.  That's what they tell me. 
[00:53:30]  And even GGAZ is even better.  Oh, okay.  As long as you don't do the G-G-E-R at the end.  Well, whatever you say.  That's when they get upset.  You all need to do that.  And the Miss Cleo thing is pretty funny, too, with her.  I guess you're doing crank calls with her.  That was funny, too.  Right.  And I don't care if a black guy dates a white girl as long as it's not exclusively just white girls.  As long as he, you know, doesn't matter to me.  So, Diane, when I'm getting out of this conversation, you only like the black bits that we do on this show. 
[00:54:00]  Well, you know, no, actually, I'm giving you approval.  Do you like any of our white boy bits?  Let's see.  Some of the things you guys do is kind of disgusting, but...  Well, of course, yeah.  I like Norton.  I think he's kind of funny.  Yeah.  But for the most part, yeah, you guys are pretty funny.  All right.  Well, thank you.  You provide a pick-me-up for the end of the day.  Well, thanks, Diane.  Okay.  Have a good one.  Well, you too.  Bye-bye.  I wonder if she ever admitted that she does listen to us. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Well, what city was she calling from?  Well, we have audio of the time, I guess, John Daly was asking Tiger if he could borrow his girlfriend.  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Ah.  All right.  A John Daly reference.  Nice, Ed.  I know you knew the PGA.  Oh, I know John Daly.  Big hitter, big drunk.  Well, yeah.  He thinks he could beat alcoholism with aspirin, pretty much. 
[00:55:00]  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  He pretty much gave up on the AA thing.  He's starting to beat AIDS with Tylenol.  He's doing it on his own.  Yeah.  He said he could do it on his own.  Eric, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah.  Are you there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  I, you know, you're talking about Tiger's new girlfriend, how they were examined her hole  by hole.  Yes.  Come on.  You want to examine her hole by hole?  What are you talking about?  Ah.  I get it.  I got to admit, and Obie, I got to admit, I always had a thing for Alice on the Brady  Bunch. 
[00:55:30]  Word.  I'm with you.  That is twisted.  Thank you.  Come on.  She had the great uniform, everything.  She'd do whatever they wanted.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Elizabeth.  Elizabeth.  Yes.  What's up?  Hi.  I just turned 16, and when I was over at my friend's house from camp, I went to, she had  this friend, and I started going out with him.  Yeah.  And I, this was like my second and her third boyfriend, and I dated two white guys before 
[00:56:00]  that.  Oh, wait.  The guy was a black guy?  Yeah.  And you're 16, and you're a white chick.  God.  Yeah.  So when did your dad have the heart attack?  Oh, God.  He didn't.  I did.  Oh, my God.  There was a huge difference between him and my last boyfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet it was huge.  I imagine there was a big difference.  Was it a huge difference?  Or just a big difference?  What?  Did you take him home to your family?  Oh, what do we ask you're asking?  Oh, no.  By the second time I went out with him, I was gone. 
[00:56:30]  I was like, no way.  Now, what was he doing that made you walk away?  Um, he just wanted a lot more physically than emotionally.  Oh, so you weren't ready to give that up?  Not yet.  And that was the big difference?  Yeah, that was the huge difference.  Yeah.  I'd say white guys want more from you, and emotionally, then they're ready to go on, and  they're not as forceful.  The brothers just want to poof. 
[00:57:00]  Was mom and dad cool when they met him?  They didn't meet him.  Yeah.  Of course not.  Did you ever tell your parents?  Um, yeah, because he called once, and my mom answered the phone.  And did he have a typical African-American type dialect?  No.  Was it like, yo, put your little hoe on the phone, bitch?  No.  No?  No.  I'll tear that ass up.  It was very American.  I'm going to tear that ass up.  Uh-huh.  So what did mommy say?  She freaked. 
[00:57:30]  Uh-oh.  Like any mom would.  What did she say?  Um...  I don't know if every mom would freak.  She didn't freak.  No, I'll be every mom would freak.  Yeah, not every mom would.  But she just, she didn't freak.  She just wanted me to understand the difference.  And by the second time I went up there, I did, on my own, understand the difference.  Wait, so what did your mom say?  Um...  I want to see how she...  I love how these moms, they try to be liberal and open and everything, but the bottom line  is, look, let me explain something.  The nation that we're living in, the whole environment we're living in, we like to sit 
[00:58:00]  around and say that we're very accepting, very liberal-minded with certain things.  And of course, anybody, if there's two people that are in love with each other, blah, blah,  blah, get them together, whatever.  But the truth of the matter is, there are still some barriers that exist between the  parents and children, that if you have a daughter and you're a white family, especially if you're  a white...  Are you a middle-class family, would you consider yourself?  Upper-middle-class, yeah.  Upper-middle-class.  You... 
[00:58:30]  Most parents, I'm going to say it, do not want their child, their daughter, dating a  black guy.  It's just the way it is.  Call me out on it, whatever you want to say.  This is the world we live in.  And I could see this girl, Elizabeth, going to her mother.  Her mother now finds out.  And the mother, trying not to sound racist and trying to sound liberal and open-minded,  but she's still this girl's mother, and, you know, she knows there's probably going to  be a lot of obstacles if you decide to, what they say, go black.  So, I need to know, what did your mom say to you? 
[00:59:00]  Um, she basically explained the whole cultural difference, the whole, um...  Wait, you gotta get...  Okay, okay.  What did she give it as a cultural...  I'll be specific.  Hold on, cultural differences, go ahead.  Okay.  She said that...  You know they get the sickle cell.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  She said that, um, most black guys... 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Um, just don't really want to commit to a white girl, basically.  Just want to use you and, you know, throw you.  Especially at 16.  Yeah.  Um...  I think that's, uh, true.  You know what?  I have to play the other side of that.  That's true for every guy that's 16.  Mm.  That is true.  Not many 16-year-old guys, the ones that are a poohahs, you want to settle down at 16.  Most of them want to get as much trim as possible.  How do we get a clip of this? 
[01:00:00]  We got a clip of the mom when, uh, Elizabeth was asking who was on the phone.  Spare checker.  Oh, my God.  Jeez.  I don't think that was a clip.  Well, also, like, my town is really small, so most of the people here grew up here, you  know, married people from the surrounding neighborhood, you know, it's just that kind of town.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  So...  How black was he?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Um...  Was he, uh, Manute Bull black? 
[01:00:30]  No.  Both his parents were.  But he was, like...  Yeah.  He was...  I don't know.  He wasn't very, very black.  And what attracted you to, uh, this gentleman in the first place?  Um, well, he was my friend's friend.  Yeah.  So, I...  I knew that I could trust him because he was my friend.  My own friend's friend's.  And, um...  Did your dad find out?  No.  He still...  Well, he did, but he didn't say anything, I guess.  I don't know my parents.  Oh, of course not.  And what else did your mom say about that? 
[01:01:00]  Nothing.  She just left me to decide for myself, really.  That's cool.  If I wanted to.  Wow.  Actually, we do have the, uh, comment that, uh, her father made.  Oh, God.  It's horrible.  All right.  Thank you, Elizabeth.  You're welcome.  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  Bye.  You know what, uh, Voss says.  Once you go black, you never go back.  Your family won't let you in.  Mike, black guy, what's up?  What's up, baby?  My two favorite crackers.  What's going on?  Yeah, kid! 
[01:01:30]  What's up, baby?  Listen.  Two points, and I'll be out your way.  One, there's no black woman on earth that will be proud to say, I know a black guy who  dates a white woman.  Really?  That doesn't happen.  Yeah, I've seen it.  They get pissed, man.  Oh, please.  My wife is the biggest racist in the world.  Michael Woods, come on TV.  Uh, he only like white girls.  He only like white girls.  Please.  Well, I would love a nice little piece of snow in my life.  Wait, your wife's black?  Yeah, of course my wife's black.  A nice piece of snow.  Remember that from what we learned.  Hey, buddy.  What, do you want to see the contrast of your hog laying on her back? 
[01:02:00]  That's right.  No, I don't want to.  Watch her expression as you pull it out your pants.  Number two.  Hold on, hold on.  I just got to back up a little bit.  It is so refreshing to hear a black guy say that his black wife is racist.  Oh, please.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Because there's a misconception.  Everyone thinks only white people can be racist.  Oh, no, no.  Black women are the biggest racists in the world. 
[01:02:30]  Don't let them get around each other.  Oh, he just loves white women.  He got to have white.  As soon as he gets old, don't let him have money.  Oh, my God.  Is he a ball player or something like that?  Yeah.  See, I knew it.  I knew it.  That's classic.  Go ahead.  I interrupted you.  And number two.  The point she made.  No, no.  It's not.  There's no black men do look forward to have a nice young white girl when they're 16.  No, it's something we look forward to.  And if we get it, it's like a badge of honor.  You got a white girl, too?  Surprise.  Surprise.  Yo, son.  Did you blaze it? 
[01:03:00]  Did you blaze it?  Did you blaze it?  Oh, man.  What?  That's right.  And then bring them home to dinner.  I'm going, brothers.  Y'all have a good day.  Very good, bro.  Wow.  All right, Mike.  It's just the way we, you know, it's the way of the world.  A lot of parents would get upset with that.  Of course.  They'd freak out.  Wayne wants to add to this.  Wayne, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, you guys rock.  Thank you, bro.  Listen to this story.  Yesterday, my sister comes home from boarding school. 
[01:03:30]  Right, 14 years old.  She says, oh, I'm going to bring my new boyfriend home.  So we're all excited to see her.  She comes to the door with this about 6'3", basketball playing, huge black dude.  My dad's eyes fell down to his freaking ass.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Down to his ass.  And he sat there at dinner.  It was the most awkward thing in the world.  Nobody was expecting it.  Did he try to be open-minded and seem...  I knew he was trying, but I knew he was trying.  I knew he was thinking, what the hell am I going to do right now? 
[01:04:00]  What am I going to do to freaking kill this dude right here?  I'll tell you, white girls, your dad doing something to piss you off, making you angry.  You hold all the cards.  All the cards.  If you walk in, and you walk in with a black eye for your boyfriend, your dad will freak  out.  It's just the way it is.  I saw my dad.  He was just freaking out.  I had no idea what to do.  Yeah.  Actually, I got some audio with your dad.  Yeah?  You're the two.  Charcoal briquette. 
[01:04:30]  A moulinion.  Sounds like Tony Soprano.  All right, guys.  You guys best.  All right, Wayne.  Let's go to Marty, a black guy.  Marty, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, and hey, how's it going?  All right.  I had a question.  I'm a black guy, and for the most part, all I've dated is white girls.  And I was curious to the fact of why the families get upset about it, because more than once,  I've been dumped because of the fact.  I'll tell you something.  I'm not your ghetto guy or anything like that, but I was just, you know, like, is it just  like the general stereotype or the whole, you know, taking advantage? 
[01:05:00]  I'll tell you.  Okay.  Black guys are at the top of that list, but it's pretty much any time you really go outside  the race to an extreme.  You know, you get an Italian, and there are some Italian families, they don't want you  dating anyone but Italians.  Right.  You know?  Right.  But a lot of Italian families, you know, they come home with Irish girls, and they're not  too happy about that either.  But that, absolutely.  But, you know, the black guys, they're at the top of the list.  But, you know, you get a girl that brings home an Asian guy or something, a lot of times  the family might freak out just as much.  Hold on. 
[01:05:30]  I got a quick story.  I've told it a bunch of times on the air.  I like this Jewish girl from Long Island.  But the mom would have nothing to do with me because she knew I wasn't Jewish.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Now, here's the deal, Marty.  I mean, this mom could care less if I was going to treat her daughter right, you know?  Right, right.  All she wanted was for this daughter to, you know, marry a Jewish guy.  Yeah.  Do you date black girls at all, Marty?  I got to be honest with you, I have not dated one yet, and I'm 21.  All right.  Now, let me, because you're going to answer your own question here. 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  Why do white people get so upset when a daughter brings home a black guy?  And you say it might be the stereotype that's there or something with an attitude of thinking  that maybe they're out for one thing, they just want the white girl.  Why don't you date black girls?  Primarily, and I'm glad no one knows me, most black girls that I've been around have, and  this is an awful stereotype, have major attitudes, and I really just don't feel like dealing with 
[01:06:30]  it.  All right.  And I think the white families look at the black guys that are brought home with the  same, in the same light, you know?  You think?  It's like, ah, okay, all I really know about black guys is, you know, they're out for the  white cooch there on my daughter, and it's, you know, going to upset them a little bit.  Hey, who's at your door?  My younger brother, who also doesn't date black chicks.  I just thought I'd mention it.  Because, like, it really gets to the point, like, because I remember, like, when I was 
[01:07:00]  young, my mom had a conversation with me, and, like, the other guy was saying how, like,  some black women are, like, you know, prejudiced anyway.  My mom's, like, almost prejudiced against black chicks.  Yeah.  Like, I think she was the one that sort of instilled in it to me, just because she's a teacher,  so most of the girls she's around is the same way.  But I don't know, I was experienced.  Are both your parents black?  Yeah, both are, but my grandparents, both grandparents, one grandparent on either side  of my family is white, so.  I got to tell you something, too. 
[01:07:30]  Now, you sound like a very articulate, educated young man.  Yeah, that's what I was brought up.  Yeah, exactly.  And your mom probably thinks now, and it sounds racist, you know, but it's coming from a black  woman, your mother, probably that you're too good for some of these girls.  Yeah, she's mentioned it more than once, I guess, on that level, now that you bring it  up like that, which I guess, like, the first time I heard it, though, I was, like, young,  so I kind of, you know, just took it as a joke, but now that you met, you know, now that 
[01:08:00]  I give it more thought, that could be it.  Yeah.  Just for it.  Good luck to you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys are awesome.  Been listening since day one.  Thanks, man.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  Bye-bye.  See if a white chick's got to bring home a black guy, at least he sounds like a nice  enough guy.  I enjoy the fact that the black guys take all the fat white chicks out of the dating pool.  That's good, too.  Thank you.  All the big, bleached, blonde, big-ass laundromat sitting white bitches takes them right out  of the mix. 
[01:08:30]  They're all out of the dating pool for us white guys.  Keep them satisfied.  Thanks to you, black guys.  You seem to love the big white ass.  You know what else it is with the parents, too?  They don't.  Now, if that guy, let's say you take a guy like that, he comes over the house.  Initially, the father's going to lose his effing mind because he's just going to see black.  That's it.  You get to know him, you talk to him, perhaps he's a fine young man, but the image that's  in a lot of white guys' heads when his daughter is dating a black guy is the gangster coming  over, you know? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I'm inviting my homies over there going, F your girl, too, B. You know what I mean?  And that's just, you know, it's the stereotype.  It horrifies white people.  It horrifies.  It's the first impression that goes through your head.  Right.  And hopefully, you at least have an open mind to see what the person's all about.  Well, you know something?  But unfortunately, in today's day and age, you know, you're asking for a freaking miracle.  It's a little rough.  Holy ass naked pictures of Tiger Woods' girl.  That one right there.  Pop it.  Where?  That can't be. 
[01:09:30]  Are they fake?  Hold on.  Holy ass.  Why would they be fake?  Look, everyone's running.  Dude, we're on Tiger Woods' new girlfriend kick in the biggest effing way.  Whoever sent this link, give them a freaking prize.  By the way, Steve from foundrymusic.com is putting up all the pictures of Tiger Woods' new...  Oh!  That's not her.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Scroll up.  Oh, scroll up.  Maybe that other one wasn't her either. 
[01:10:00]  I don't think it was.  Oh, no.  It was now.  That was the other one.  That's not her either.  Oh.  Look at us bitching, even though we just saw it, like, really hot chicks naked.  False alarm.  Ben.  All right.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is putting up pictures of Tiger Woods' new girlfriend.  And nude girls that kind of look like her.  Yeah, you might as well.  Steve, you want hits today on your website?  Put that link up there, too.  All right.  We're going to continue, man. 
[01:10:30]  The phones have exploded over this dating thing, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah.  Also, Anthony, I think when we come back, we're going to play today's Wesley Willis Song of the Day.  Ah, beautiful.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  From the show.  From the show.  That's right, guys.  Andrew W.K., Anthony, party hard. 
[01:11:00]  Andrew W.K.  That's the name, huh?  On any given day, we have no clue what direction this show is going to go in.  Yes.  We weren't going to talk about the black-white thing today, but the phones have exploded, Anthony.  Yes.  And Charlie's a white guy.  I date mostly black girls.  Their families flip out, too.  Really?  Let's check out the other side of this issue, I guess.  Charlie, what's going on?  Gentlemen.  Hey.  What's happening?  What up?  Listen, I'm a white guy. 
[01:11:30]  I'm fairly well-educated.  I have a good job.  And I grew up in an area that pretty much was predominantly black.  So, since I was 13, 14, hanging out with black girls.  And I've had too many times where you go to the house and the dad's like, take a look at you.  And I feel like this crazy stress come over me.  You don't even know what to do.  So, it's like the flip side of the coin, you know?  So, they're not happy that you're going out with their black daughters.  They're absolutely not.  I'm not really packing any heat in my pants, either.  So, the girls, you know, the girls are pleased. 
[01:12:00]  But it's just a freaking mess dealing with these uneducated, older black men that stereotype white guys as, you know, like their master or something like that.  I don't even know how to put it.  You know, they're coming from the old school.  Have you ever dated a white girl?  Yeah, I dated white girls.  I dated black girls.  I dated Puerto Rican girls.  What's your preference?  Puerto Ricans, actually.  Because they got the rhythm.  They got the juice.  All right, Charlie.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  And? 
[01:12:30]  No.  Not going to work.  All right.  Scott, a white guy married to a black girl.  Same thing when I go to her house.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, I'll tell you.  Yeah, I was married for 10 years to a white woman.  Divorced.  Went on a number of dates.  Went out with a woman.  Fell in love with her.  Beautiful black woman.  Doctor.  Went to talk to her dad about marriage.  He ran from the phone screaming, why are you doing this to me? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  See, most people, I think, it's natural to just want your children to marry within your same race or ethnic background, whatever you want to call it.  Or something that is close.  Close enough is all right.  No, no.  You want to close like you want to slowly and get it right.  Here's the kicker.  Mom picked up the phone and said, let me talk to the young man.  I got on the phone. 
[01:13:30]  She said, has my daughter seen your W-2s?  Uh-oh.  What did that mean?  She wanted to make sure that I wasn't some kind of tax evader.  Oh, like maybe some guy that's, because she's a career woman trying to get some cash from her.  Right.  Hmm.  Right.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Well, what happened?  Well, we've been married for almost seven years.  Oh, God bless. 
[01:14:00]  Have they accepted you at all?  Yes, yes.  You know, the grandparents haven't.  They're still, you know, that's a whole other issue.  Oh, they kind of remember the good old days, believe me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they don't want to remember.  They look at you and remember fire hoses and backs of buses.  Whites only pools.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're bringing a dozen roses over the house, and the grandparents, all they see is a hose.  Oh, you want to talk about the most uncomfortable moment of my life is when I met her grandmother.  Really?  Did you call her grandmammy? 
[01:14:30]  Maybe that was the problem.  You know, I was very polite.  You know, Miss, you know, she ignored me for an hour, would not talk to me, would not respond to anything I said.  Didn't offer me a seat in her home or anything else like that.  See, people are animals.  That's all it is.  We're all animals.  And in the same way that you don't see other animals mating with other species or whatever, it's just the way it happens.  We're still animals, and black, white, or whatever the hell you are, you want your offspring to remain with its own. 
[01:15:00]  And it's just the natural way people are.  Well, I'll tell you, we have a beautiful daughter who's four now.  Supermodel?  She is on her way to being a supermodel.  The black, white combo, you're raising supermodels.  You're crazy you don't get into that.  You got it.  They come out very attractive with a permatan that's wonderful.  Yeah, no skin cancer.  Yeah.  They don't have to worry about getting a little dark.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Scott, thank you.  Hey, you guys suck.  Thank you, ma'am. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  I think Danny's a father.  He's checking in on this.  Danny!  Yeah?  What's up, bro?  How you doing?  All right.  All right.  Here's an explanation.  Every guy knows what they want to do to a girl, right?  Yeah.  That's their intention.  Every guy watches porno movies, right?  Yeah.  And every porno movie, there's always a black and a white, you know, thing going on, right?  Some.  All right.  Well, you know, some.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't you know how this show works?  Yeah, you got it.  Okay, okay.  Do you know how this show works?  You cannot use the descriptive term for the...  Okay, junk.  Right.  We're responsible broadcasters. 
[01:16:00]  I hope Washington is hearing us say that.  That's why we say junk.  Yeah, we just can't use...  I mean, for future reference, for everyone that calls the show, we just can't use the P word  to describe the man's thing.  Right.  You could say junk, but that's why we call it a mule or a yam egg or, you know.  All right, so, and it's a little stereotypical, but they usually have big junk.  Right.  Right.  And the father sees the black guy walk in the house, and that's the first thing that  comes to his mind.  That's what he's going to do to his daughter.  I'm going to tear that up. 
[01:16:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  I don't want to see that.  I don't want to picture that in the head, because they're picturing, well, this is what  I want to do to somebody else, you know, when they're a kid.  And then they're picturing this guy with the big junk, you know?  I guess it's bad enough picturing your innocent daughter, you know, having sex, but then  to put it over the top with, you know, a black guy that has an arm for a mule, maybe that's  part of the problem.  It makes it a little worse, I guess?  Is that what you're trying to say?  A little bit, yeah.  And by the way, I actually dated a black girl.  And, I mean, you know, I think it's great. 
[01:17:00]  I mean, you know, it's fun for me.  All right.  I mean, I have no problem with it, but I think that that's what goes through, you know, guys,  their daughter's head, you know, they're thinking about this huge mule.  I got you.  You know what it is?  I think this is one part of racism that is still so alive and well and so far from ever  being taken care of.  Because we've gotten to the point now where, you know, anyone could shop where they want.  Jobs are open up to people that are qualified regardless of race. 
[01:17:30]  And there are laws out there that are in place to make sure this happens if something of the  contrary happens.  You know, you could go to a lawyer and sue a company for not hiring you because you're  black.  Hell, in my life, man, it's gotten to the point if I'm on the subway and a black guy sits  next to me, I don't even flinch.  It's the damn towel heads that I worry about now.  Right.  That's another story.  We could all hate the towel heads together now.  But that is a part of racism that is just so. 
[01:18:00]  It's the towel heads that make me nervous now when I'm on a subway.  Is that it?  Hell yeah.  Or a train and I see one sitting there.  I'm like, oh, hey, he might be a nice guy and he has no intention of hijacking a plane.  But you know what?  It's making me nervous.  Black guy, no problem with me.  Right.  No problem.  See, we're overcoming.  Matt's a racist and he's very pissed off at us.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  You should not even be talking about this crap right now. 
[01:18:30]  Stuff that goes on.  What's the problem?  No, this is stuff that should not go on.  Oh, boy.  First of all, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I got a daughter.  She's six years old.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, if she ever, ever.  Matt, real quick for us.  Where are you from?  I'm from Philly.  Oh.  Could have sworn it was from Boston.  Could have sworn it was from Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, then.  I got a daughter.  She's six years old.  Yeah.  For a white guy that doesn't like black people, you picked a great city to live in.  Well, you know, I live in a suburb of Philly, so I'm not quite in that district there. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  What's the problem with your daughter now?  Well, she's six years old, and God forbid, I'm dreading the years ahead.  If she ever brings anybody besides white into my home, God forbid what's going to happen.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Violence.  Very, very violent, because it's not right.  It's not right, and it shouldn't happen. 
[01:19:30]  What if it makes her happy there, Matt?  What's that?  What if it makes her happy?  What if this black guy treats her right, takes care of her?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Tends to her needs.  No.  What if he's a good guy and not like this stereotypical image you have in your head?  Let's say the daughter blows it off, blows off this guy.  Could you put it in other terms, I'll be?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blows off this guy because she's trying to make you happy, and this guy would have been  real nice to her and stuff, and then marries maybe a white guy to make you happy, and  the white guy turns out to be a real douchebag and beats her all the time and blah, blah, blah. 
[01:20:00]  Well, you know what?  If anybody lays a hand on my daughter, I'll kill him, and I'll go to jail for it, but  if it's a black guy, I'll kill him myself, and I'll just, I'll go nuts.  See, part of that primal racism, Opie, that comes through when a father is faced with the  thought of his lily white daughter dating a black guy.  Well, what would happen if you had kids and your daughter father would die that you didn't... 
[01:20:30]  Hey, let me...  Why I'm not having kids.  Well, good for you.  Let me give you a scenario.  Did you see that movie Traffic?  Oh, God.  No, I did not.  No, I did not.  Oh, there's a scene in there that you need to see, my friend.  Why is that?  Michael Douglas' daughter starts smoking some of the crack, you know what I mean?  She turns into a little bit of a druggy and crackhead.  I got you.  You know, one of those families.  Very upper class.  Upper middle class, you know.  And the father is searching for her because she kind of disappears. 
[01:21:00]  By the way, one of the hottest and most erotic scenes in movie history.  It's blatant abuse.  It's horrible.  There's something really hot about that scene.  The father comes in because...  I got the DVD in.  I've seen that scene at least 20 times.  No.  The father, Michael...  Don't even say it's black and white.  Yeah, Michael Douglas comes in, and there's this crack dealer, black guy, just banging  away on his white daughter.  His underage white daughter.  Underage white daughter.  He's at the door, right? 
[01:21:30]  Didn't Michael Douglas see this going on, right?  Yeah, at one point, you just see his black ass going up and down.  Just going to town, bro.  Going to town.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  I'm not a racist.  I got to call your TV.  All right.  He had to add a funny joke to the whole discussion we were having.  All right.  Are you guys sorry?  All right.  Tracy, who was in the 55-gallon drum challenge,  she's raising a supermodel.  She's married to a white guy.  She's black.  She's from the D.C. area.  What's up, Tracy? 
[01:22:00]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  Actually, I'm from Augusta, and let me tell you, down there, the biggest thing is to work  at the Masters when you're in high school.  The Massas.  Yeah.  And when those white guys come in.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You just brought up a funny, funny thing, though.  The tournament is in Atlanta.  Augusta.  Which is, man, I mean, there's more black people in Atlanta than white people.  Oh, yeah.  Especially in the metro area.  And they have a golf tournament called the Masters. 
[01:22:30]  The Massas.  I'm going to work at the Massas.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  But the biggest thing.  You guys got the Freak Nick down there.  Freak Nick.  The white execs that come down for the tournament.  Yeah.  All they want are black girls.  Oh, really?  Sure.  As soon as they can get you, or think that they can get you to go off to the side, or  anywhere, that's what they want.  I have a friend who still, to this day, keeps in touch with an exec from Sony. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Asian guy?  No, he's white.  Oh.  Sony USA.  Does he have a brother that's also in the business?  I'm not sure.  But all I know is he came down while we were in high school and met her.  Yeah.  And she has no worries financially.  When you were in high school?  Yeah.  Because the high school kids work at the different stands on the green.  Tracy, explain Freak Nick to us white folk. 
[01:23:30]  Awesome.  And I were down there, I think, the week before Freak Nick, and I swear to you, all the white  locals warned us to get out of town before Saturday, and people were boarding up their  businesses in the whole metro area.  Freak Nick is African for white man leave.  The black Woodstock, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, I hear it's like the black spring break.  And the locals do, well, the white locals are just not happy about it.  We were stuck in traffic because some black students decided to get out and dance on their 
[01:24:00]  cars.  Yeah, that's pretty much what happened.  And all the girls are doing the F me dance, where they just bend over and rotate their  ass around and wait for some guy to just come up behind her.  Yeah.  And we're sitting there going, oh, my God, what are we going to do?  Hey, move along.  Yeah, no.  No, we just sat there and watched like a bunch of pussies.  Well, you know what, the biggest problem that me and my husband face is, I hate to say  this, the white trash, uneducated white people, those are the ones who have the biggest problem 
[01:24:30]  with it.  God damn.  And you know what, most of them, their daughters are...  Oh, hey.  Sorry.  Can't say that word.  No, no, no, no.  Really, like the guy who just called in, I guarantee you, his daughter will be...  Oh.  Banging as many black guys as she can.  Oh.  By the age of 16.  Wow.  Not earlier.  He's shooting himself.  Yeah.  All right, Tracy.  He is.  Always a pleasure to talk to you. 
[01:25:00]  Thank you.  I love you guys.  You suck.  All right, Paige.  Thanks.  Bye.  I can't wait for your daughter to be of age there, Tracy.  People are sending...

[01:38:30]  children yes okay guys what did they have a leaflet that they send out or a mass email uh this week in  our local parents group we're going to be discussing radio and our children and then they all sit around  and go oh okay that's a good topic let me have a homework assignment we want everyone to pick a radio  show and and listen to it for a week and come back with uh your comments when we all sit in a circle  in the basement of a church ah i did not know of your program until this time in which a parent 
[01:39:00]  expressed concern over the fact that her 13 year old daughter and 15 year old son were having sex  with each other no no oh no sorry uh and 15 year old son were listening to your program in the car  what is wrong with that statement um why would you listen to this program in the car with your 13  year old daughter and 15 year old son you had the power this parent had the power not that we care  trust me but in this case the parent had the power to just go kick kick end of problem but decided i 
[01:39:30]  guess uh you know i guess she didn't have the power over the kids and she had to sit through this  and 15 year old son were listening to your program in the car and during this episode on the air you  killed a lamb and made women eat the entrails of the animal as part of a contest um hmm let me think  hold on i don't i don't want to you know go off half cocked here did we ever kill a lamb on our radio  show anthony i'm trying to no i know we killed rats once yeah good eating killed the lamb and made women 
[01:40:00]  eat the entrails of the animal as part of a contest no i think someone came in and ate uh the brains  of a lamb get your your crap straight as far as a lamb is concerned we had a girl come in and eat  lamb brains right out of a skull that was brought here by uh mal who's a french chef people eat lamb  brains it's not all that odd uh the other thing we had was lamb blood which was also restaurant 
[01:40:30]  quality we didn't drain a living lamb here for the blood and uh we put it in a super soaker and  hosed a girl down in her bronze panties which was just fantastic so many people so many people get  the the facts wrong as far as the show go yeah and then they amazed me and these are the same people  that bitch and complain to our bosses and to uh government agencies that run message boards and  they get it all right they get it all wrong half-assed listening with half an ear uh uh 
[01:41:00]  making up your own crap so it sounds better mind your own business don't listen to this show  tell you tell your 13 year old daughter and 15 year old son that you don't want them listening to this  show in your car don't blame us you're a bad parent uh being involved in talk radio myself must be a  great show i understand that murdering animals on air is frowned upon by the fcc murdered uh some rats 
[01:41:30]  that day and cooked them and ate them so i explained to the parent that you most likely  only pretended to engage in these acts as a bit hey i agree with this guy just pretend fake everything  she listed numerous other bits she found offensive after monitoring your program and i thought it only  fair to listen to your show with the group the following week with the group now they sit around  as a group and listen to the show they take a tape popping it okay brace yourselves now people  what you're about to hear may make you puke we're gonna play this tape before we get to the booze and 
[01:42:00]  swinging uh so they listened as a group where am i uh okay uh okay the program we reviewed you had  billed as the 55 gallon drum challenge you have picked a good one group why couldn't they pick one of  those days where we just had nothing going on too bad it wasn't sex for sam anthony oh that would  even be better yeah sex for sam coming soon to the opian anthony show yes i think we're doing that 
[01:42:30]  in the month of may uh quite frankly i found the program revolting revolting apart from the use of  disgusting byproducts and live animals i took i took particular offense to the blatant misogyny  sadism misogyny oh sorry uh misogyny sadism and pedophile pedophilia jokes which uh strewed the show  i told the horrified parents in my group horrified opie yeah i love when people are horrified you know 
[01:43:00]  what horrifies people uh uh horrific crash terrorism murder not a dopey radio show horrified  dare you use that word horrified is what uh people were feeling when they saw the whole uh twin tower  thing yeah take that emotion of watching the towers collapse that's being horrified i was horrified  not listening to a show of people laughing women who are in the 55 gallon drums having various things 
[01:43:30]  dumped on them uh and laughing and enjoying it and and being part of a show that isn't horrifying by the  way we didn't force any of the ladies to do it they wanted of course not well that's our next one we  are going to just grab women and force them well after all we always got to take it to the next level  right it wasn't that one though i told the horrified parents in my group that you obviously  were again only pretending to do such things and the girls were quite all right well they were not  all right one girl couldn't stand after she got out of the drum yeah shaking like crazy and she needed

[01:44:30]  which you opened with a disrespectful mocking of the world trade center attacks under the guise of  being serious an offense which i know no words to express all right listen you douchebag brent i you  can say whatever the f you want and get all your facts wrong about every single other thing we do on  this show but i will not accept the fact that you think we made fun of the world trade center in that  in that way when i read that line i'm sitting there going what the hell was he listening to unless you 
[01:45:00]  nobody you know what this ass munch dope f probably heard us actually discussing the world trade center  like we had many times on this program in a serious manner and he probably took it as sarcasm  because of other things we do on this show oh wow when you say you uh you know you're standing  behind the police and fire department and you're outraged by this obviously they mean they're not  where did he get that from and i won't accept that brent you douche listen closer kill yourself 
[01:45:30]  uh from there your show became a forum for racists and pedophiles such as jim norton well he is a  racist and a pedophile ready for this ready for this yeah i wish jim was here today but he's flying  to cleveland for those uh those shows oh this is great oh yeah hold on hold on well let me strap in  i got a seatbelt everyone should strap in for this next line strap in they're talking about  jim norton i'll back up i'll back up and read the whole sentence i'm gonna tuck into the crash 
[01:46:00]  position i need a pillow i wish jim was here to hear this i know from there your show became a  forum for racists and pedophiles such as jim norton who the group will be looking at next week in our  discussion of comedy gone too far comedy gone too far comedy can't go far enough my friends why don't 
[01:46:30]  you get your group together and have a game of russian roulette or go drink some kool-aid do something  you're bored here it is look look brent are you listening with your group brent i'll direct this  right to you wait wait wait wait for them to get their pad and pencils out get your pad and pencil  brent because now that you've described our show so accurately let me let me tell you a little  something about you and your group you are bored crapless parents you might have this little inkling of 
[01:47:00]  recollection of a life that was fun that was free-spirited and spontaneous that may have  included some off-color humor some dark humor and just maybe some fun and good times which you chose  to throw away by uh becoming a parent that's your prerogative i don't care i frankly i really don't  care but to then use your your lack of entertainment to put together this group where you judge what 
[01:47:30]  other people should be listening to whether comedy has gone too far who are you to judge what comedy  goes too far you're bored parents you're bored you forgot what a good time is this show is for people  that enjoy having good times who understand what fun is and who remember who remember what it was  like to have fun there are plenty of parents that listen to this program have a great time with it 
[01:48:00]  still go out and have fun oh there's a million parents calling us by the way they're not in these  groups groups of other dull people with no lives trying to decide what's good for humanity  please get your group together get in a closed room and pop a canister of zyklon b and die well get out  the basement of the church and take your kid to a ball game or to the park or something yeah you're  wasting too much time go raise your kid and leave us out of it disgust me i realize that you are 
[01:48:30]  attempting to make a humorous program for young adults but your show goes too far in whose opinion  a bunch of idiots this is this is brought up all the time we have young uh young listeners we know that  but we also have a lot of older listeners yeah a lot of people like to just blow that up no no that  programs just for a bunch of teenage boys yeah it's not true ah you could perhaps uh learn from the  example of other radio personalities who are considered controversial considered controversial 
[01:49:00]  such as don imus don imus what year are you living in brent or someone uh a show we know uh very well  because anthony's uh ex-money law loves lon and wally up in massachusetts i love lon and wally they are so  much fun i would i used to have to i used to have to when i'd have to pick my wife up because she would 
[01:49:30]  go to uh uh the mother's house xy xy it's over at the time i mean that's what i'm talking about at the  time oh are you when i had to pick up you're going back to the future i'm back to the future hey listen  listen so let me read the line before you go on because this tangent will go on for 15 minutes  knowing you you can perhaps learn from the example of other radio personalities who are considered  controversial such as don imus or lauren and wally hold on who's you and who use god why isn't jim here  i know write this down for the when we talk to jim who use i love this word madcap humor 
[01:50:00]  but use it intelligently madcap that's some madcap humor thank god we don't do madcap humor  the day we do madcap humor is the day i put a bullet in the back of my skull madcap humor when was  the last time you heard oh that's some madcap humor i don't know that is madcap i think that's 
[01:50:30]  a word right out of the vaudeville days vaudeville you know when i used to go and watch vaudeville  shows it was madcap humor madcap humor okay so uh lon and wally lon and wally i you know me and opie  would be doing our radio show and and doing the best we can trying our our hardest to come up with  something a little different and fun and and uh something that will catch people's attention on  a daily basis and uh i would i would go to pick up at the at the time wife at the the mother-in-law's 
[01:51:00]  house and i'd hear you should have heard lon and wally today they were so funny what they were doing  this very funny thing where men called in to answer questions that only women are supposed to know the  aunts is too and i'd be like that's great that's battle of sexism which is the oldest radio bit in  america there it is trying to eke out an existence in this uh medium and uh i just have to hear endlessly 
[01:51:30]  about how funny a lot and wally speaking of influencing their listeners lon and wally made your uh  your ex monologue drunk what what are you saying opie well she liked the box of wine  box of wine i noticed she started drinking more uh boxes of wine uh you know after she started  listening to that program maybe that's what makes lauren and wally funny you got to be drinking boxes  of wine all right so then sometimes i would even take long to drive home i wouldn't even make right 
[01:52:00]  turns no lefts no rights i drive straight and listen to lon and wally uh i understand that you  are trying to make a living in a difficult business but think of the effects you are having on children  today none on us none on us we're artists we're artists don't care brent we're artists  incidents such as the columbine this is the yeah here you go and they bring it up all the time for some 
[01:52:30]  reason we're everyone us marilyn manson everyone responsible for columbine in except for who's  really responsible they're lousy crappy parents who weren't listening to their children talk weren't  listening even at the last minute to their children building bombs in their garage but no it's it's radio  like we do it's music like marilyn man take away the violent video games and uh and the music and and  the cool uh you know the programs that we get to see on tv and the movies and i guarantee there'll 
[01:53:00]  be there'll be a ton of columbines brent country i can only i can only hope brent your children grow  up to grab a gun and shoot up their friggin school to prove what a lousy parent you are because that's  what people that you know what brent let me explain something to you people don't look at a situation  like columbine normal people don't look at a situation like that and blame the media and blame music and  radio they don't do that you do because you're insane with your stupid group people look at the 
[01:53:30]  parents they watch the crying parents on tv and go there's the ass wipe useless loser responsible for  the monsters that shot up their school not the media so i can only dream that it happens to you so we  can look at your stupid crying face on television because no normal person blames the media you're you're  you're a minority in this so i don't know incidents such as the columbine murders should prove why 
[01:54:00]  people like yourselves must rethink their views or risk or tragedy no imagine if you will okay let me  imagine i'll put on my imagine hat one of your young listeners performing the same violent acts on women  you profess to find funny let me imagine that hold on i gotta do something first okay let me start  imagining i guess going back to the 55 gallon jump challenge yeah yeah where the girls volunteer to  do this right right if there are girls out there that want to volunteer to to kind of get uh you 
[01:54:30]  know a bunch of stuff dumped on them by their their friends in the neighborhood what's that hurting if  you have somebody that listens to this show and does the exact same thing we do on this show there's no  problem there's no problem you have a guy and a girl and the guy goes hey yeah baby you want to get  in this uh drum i'll seal up the top and i'll throw crap on you all night and the girl goes that sounds  like a blast you know what there's no problem with that you make it sound like we ran out on the streets 
[01:55:00]  apprehended some girls as kicking and screaming threw them in a barrel and dumped stuff on them well there  was one there was one all right and an extra barrel all right most of the girls we got  that should end up winning the contest i know sorry  uh it would be a tragic wake-up call for both of you yeah and i hope you will remember the next  time you turn on a microphone that you are affecting an impressionable audience and wrong none on us

[02:00:00]  stand up and have the balls and say uh kathleen put your clothes back on kathleen put your clothes back  on okay so now they want to sue us yeah um this is something we spoke about what last week uh yes  when uh steve went to the play and uh he said there's 15 seconds or so where she drops a towel and she's 
[02:00:30]  standing there kathleen turner completely naked full frontal nudity big bush the whole deal and we  just uh suggested somebody go to the show right when that happens i hear the audience gets completely  quiet because it's very awkward there's a lot of yeah there's like oh and then that low and a lot  a little low rumbling as they discuss oh my god she's completely naked oh my god this must be  so it's horrible i'm embarrassed i can't believe she's doing this this is horrifying she doesn't 
[02:01:00]  actually think she's hot and cute up there does she yeah so um we suggest somebody at that moment of  awkward quiet mumbling just stand up and yell out hey kathleen put your goddamn clothes back on right  and which you know it would would completely freak her out and of course we need a tape so we could  kind of uh exploit it on our radio program right we know we're exploiting we're not gonna fake it to  you guys of course so uh now uh kathleen turner's people called uh ken stevens uh-huh super gm ken 
[02:01:30]  stevens ken stevens had to put out the fire anthony and he promised kathleen turner's people that we are  wink wink nudge nudge not uh running a contest of course that we are not giving a prize away yeah to  the person that does this right and i say to that anthony yes new angle  what's the new angle i will give a very very good prize oh to the first person uh-huh that comes 
[02:02:00]  down to the opian anthony show with a ticket to see the graduate on broadway oh what do we got  i whatever we have the bet i don't care i'll go to the goddamn atm machine again do we have um  do we have something good like a good electronics type prize or something we'll come up with something  really good i need a ticket to the graduate one ticket one ticket to see the graduate on broadway we 
[02:02:30]  need one ticket and now the contest has changed i will give a prize to the person that brings down  a ticket to see the graduate just bring a ticket that's right you'll get believe me you will get  more in prize value than the ticket value of the show so it's a good trade-off we'll do that  we'll come up with something very good guys and ladies we do not ask much from you guys yeah you know 
[02:03:00]  that uh-huh you know that preferably a ticket for sunday's performance oh dude we can't put a date  out there they'll be looking i'm just saying preferably you think they'll know maybe we're  throwing them off i'm smart that is good let's just put it this way we need one ticket to see the  graduate one ticket to see the graduate someone has got to take one for the team there's probably a lot  of a lot of husbands out there that are being forced to see this play yes take those tickets from 
[02:03:30]  your wife when she's not looking uh-huh and make believe she lost them and and uh deliver them to  our studio uh-huh preferably a ticket in the first 20 rows oh yeah it should be close it should be a  good ticket not the balcony no not the balcony not that gotta be up not that whoa we need orchestra we  need orchestra seating orchestra seating to see the graduate first person that gets me a ticket uh-huh 
[02:04:00]  will win a very nice prize yes and i don't think we're breaking any rules by doing uh this little  country absolutely aren't and when you you give us the ticket that ticket will go to somebody who will  then sit in the audience i ah anthony i just need a ticket i hope i just need a ticket all right  stop being captain obvious over there i'm not being captain obvious i just need a ticket all right 
[02:04:30]  maybe my mom wants to go see the play maybe i just need a ticket can she yell loud i need a ticket  all right shut up all right just wonder why don't you just write it on your forehead what  oh yeah because we're being so vague what we are

[02:24:30]  on line four steve yes steve hey what's going on guys hey bro they've got these little mini  bullhorns for kids they're they're not like long like a regular bullhorn is you probably could slip  one into a jacket pocket really not that noticeably and they don't make your voice that much louder but  it's enough to get some attention in that place why are we talking about making our voices louder  i just needed a pair take us to the graduate do you know what the acoustics are like in a theater  they're fine all right should we get the porn stars in here or what but we got to do the 
[02:25:00]  porn stars we got to do the paul mercurio i want to hear the paul thing by the way who can be seen  at rascals and ocean township this weekend rascals ocean township this weekend is by the order  tonight tonight saturday and sunday tonight saturday and sunday paul you tonight any  saturday and sunday you get any plugs you want you're a great friend of this program  rascals ocean township with paul mercurio tonight headlining saturday and sunday right  very funny guy speaking of headlining uh paul mercurio headlines the uh the audience for the daily 
[02:25:30]  show he warms up the audience just like any tv program that is taped in front of people before  they uh tape they have somebody that warms up the audience it gets the energy level up to help the  star right i'm there i'm there to help the man in front of the camera exactly i'm a giver  mm-hmm absolutely we've been making fun of this for uh a very long time and uh well we got some tape  of paul warming up i love this the daily show audience for john stewart are you full of energy and 
[02:26:00]  everything oh this is great all right we've got a few clips this is really unsettling here's the  first one oh you're gonna be on tv let me hear you come on now oh you're gonna do better than that  loud i need i need hooting and hollering yes louder louder oh my god hooting and hollering you know  something i actually wasn't when i used to do the imitation of what i believed it sounded like 
[02:26:30]  it wasn't even that bad hooting i never used hooting no one hoots anymore i don't have any earphones i  can't hear myself out there right that's why i have no monitor hey hey now why i go and i spin plates  is a whole other issue but spin the plates and then a monkey comes out you grind the organ it goes out  into the audience and gets money in a cup well i need to get them you know so they start this rather 
[02:27:00]  lackluster and i think it was rainy that day so they kind of you know yeah um all right i'll shut  up now all right here's the rest of this one look look i'm running look look at me run wow  i'm running around the desk you know i'm putting out energy louder don't stop i'll tell you when  to stop oh come on come on sir please come on oh yeah louder louder one two three go wow 
[02:27:30]  you can do better than that folks here we go let's do your rest right now go wow  it really is it really is the point of work keep going keep going don't stop  i'm i'm the people probably just you were running around the desk yeah what were you running  was it in place running or why did i set myself up for this well i was sort of walking around the 
[02:28:00]  desk at a brisk pace in order to uh in order to sort of physicalize the idea of energy for the  people you know what i'm saying so come on you can do better than that and i'd be sitting there thinking  i was really doing the best i can and there i got no more for you like my mother leave me alone  built to it sweet merciful crap that's what i'd be in the audience jay yeah what's going on guys hey  what's up i got a question for you i need uh your opinion on something uh can you just uh let me know 
[02:28:30]  how's my hooting in ah jay callback your phone stinks his phone sucked he was going to ask you if uh  if his hooting is uh good enough for you all right and then he's gonna hoot i'll judge it all right  here's uh you can do better than that here's another clip of paul mercurio warming up the audience  all right so uh you can kind of get the drift here because when you're home and you hear  you're watching a show and you hear the audience studio audience laughing it affects you even if  it's a lame show with a crappy punchline you know or something you're like you know hey look look at 
[02:29:00]  the bell rang and you're like when they hear them laugh and you're laughing and you're saying yourself  i've become a tool why am i you know well you're those people tonight um so just sort of participate  with us and be nice and you really are half of this you're 50 percent of this i can't stress  oh my god your energy guests will feed off your energy and uh just have a great time and enjoy  yourself that's the exact line that's what i said that's what he's doing now john will john will feed  off your energy see oh my god i was saying the same thing i thought you knew i did that no i swear 
[02:29:30]  that's even worse how about we have to stop this now how about you get the audience to do the bang bang  bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang no i don't i look i have standards right  right you're not going to go the bang bang route well let's see uh let's uh listen to another clip  as it warms up the daily show audience for john stewart on comedy central hi everybody my name is uh  paul i'm your warm-up chimp say hello to me oh you can do better than that say hello to me  there you go um what's your name man andrea nice meeting that your husband oh hey how's it going 
[02:30:00]  awesome wow look at you talking like an 18 year old i'll punch you in the face  seriously i don't know what's wrong with you is that a way to warm up an audience by threatening  violence on them it's not your typical warm-up right i try to take it to another place i run  around the desk and i punch people right around the desk i verbally parade them tell them that they're 
[02:30:30]  not living up to my expectations and then i threaten them with physical violence are you going to be on  uh 48 hours five years from now crying you're like the bad father you're not good enough and dad i  scored a touchdown why not two not good enough people and this next clip really emphasizes that  it's only like three seconds check the great paul santini oh you beat me to it you bastard all right

[02:31:30]  that was that woman i think i said something else i don't know hey uh here's another clip in yeah okay  we're gonna kind of rush through this because the porn star is getting all freaked out falls all upset  we gotta rush through it by the way paul mercurio playing tonight saturday and sunday  at roscoe's in ocean township township very funny guy headlining it's a 732 area code all right here's  uh paul you seem very calm and happy with your wife you divorced did you ever cheat on your wife
