<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a brand new intro, a departure from their previous, trouble-focused one.  The main focus of the broadcast was a detailed recounting of a weekend trip to Foxwoods Casino with comedian Jimmy Norton.  The trip began with a chaotic drive, exacerbated by Kenny's refusal to use a GPS or wear his glasses, resulting in them getting hopelessly lost in the rain.  Norton's behavior was a significant point of discussion, including a memorable incident where he allegedly exposed his genitals from his hotel balcony overlooking the woods.  His weekend was further complicated by severe nausea, which he couldn't relieve until reaching the hotel.

The hosts then shifted to their experience at a new Connecticut comedy club, praising the welcoming staff and receptive audience.  A large portion of the show covered their gambling escapades at Foxwoods, with specific details about their wins and losses. Norton's gambling session was particularly noteworthy, stretching over approximately 12 hours. They described their opulent suite at Foxwoods, emphasizing its amenities, the excellent food at the Paragon restaurant, and the copious amounts of food and alcohol they consumed.  The excessive smoking within the casino was also discussed, along with Norton's considerable exhaustion following the trip.  Finally, there was humorous commentary regarding the casino's confusing layout, the quality of the food, and the use of a panoramic photo app to capture their luxurious suite.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Apparently, Opie and Anthony are dicks.  Oh, here they go again. 
[00:03:30]  Fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dreams.  The show is a lot funnier on N.E.W.  The show's host, Anthony Kalia and Greg Opie here.  It's an controversial team.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me.  I didn't want to say it's racist, but goddamn.  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go, all right.  God, we just lost our demo, man. 
[00:04:00]  What's wrong with you?  He's just the last draw for the watching radio duo.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh.  What happened?  Shocked?  Yeah.  Jimmy just got shocked by his headphones.  You're right.  That happened.  I hate that.  Oh, I hate that.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Got a grounding problem.  What kind of welcome back is that?  No kidding.  You almost got jacked to death. 
[00:04:30]  I was going to say, nice brand new show intro.  I like it.  Yeah, that was funny.  We're not in trouble anymore, finally.  Our intro was all about us being in trouble.  The media talking about us being in trouble.  And I'm thinking, we haven't been in trouble in a few years.  Yeah, so let's move on.  Move on with the new intro.  Right.  Morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Everyone's weekend was fun.  It sure was.  How was Foxwoods, boys?  Great.  Had so much fun.  Jimmy Norton, a genius performance again. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, thank you.  So goddamn funny.  New shit that I haven't seen.  It's just like.  Wait, wait, wait.  You actually went and saw him?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  The Friday early show.  I did.  We went to dinner.  We went to dinner together.  You had to take a break from the tables, huh?  No, I hadn't started yet.  Actually, we all went to the luxurious suite that Foxwoods put us up in.  My God.  That thing was great.  It was like a hotel inside the hotel, his room.  I had a lobby in my room. 
[00:05:30]  That's nice.  And we all went out to dinner.  We went to a very good restaurant.  Oh, my God.  That place was fantastic.  Yes.  What was it?  Paragon.  Paragon.  Paragon.  There at Foxwoods.  And, of course, lots of lofts having dinner when you're sitting with the likes of Jimmy  Norton and Club Soda Kenny and Danny.  What's his name with the comic?  Keith.  He wasn't there, right?  Oh, Lenny.  Oh, Keith the cop.  Oh, Lenny the nerd.  No, Lenny's a very funny comedian.  I like Lenny.  He took a nap while we went out to dinner.  I know. 
[00:06:00]  He was like, come on.  What a girl.  Oh, we were laughing.  Why would you do that?  Food was great.  And then I caught Jimmy's show.  Like I said, really funny.  Killed.  Thank you, man.  And then it was time to hit the tables and pay for some of the stuff that I enjoyed.  How did you wind up doing?  Whoopsie.  Down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Down.  I had a great comeback because I was really down.  Whose ass is that?  What's up?  That's Jimmy.  That's Norton?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's out on my balcony.  Jimmy decided he was just going to let his dick swing in the breeze a little. 
[00:06:30]  I was genuflecting.  Genuflecting.  It's a ritual before any gig.  Oh, just overlooking the woods.  I was overlooking the woods.  Oh, it's a beautiful foliage to overlook.  And your dick's out.  And there's his ass just facing the window of the balcony.  Wonderful.  Yeah, you can't really see my penis.  You can just see me looking pensively off into the distance.  You kind of got your hip kind of checked a little bit to one side.  Very nice shot right there.  Very artistic.  Yeah, artistic. 
[00:07:00]  That's what I call it.  That should be your next album cover.  I wish he would have fallen over the balcony and they found him with his pants down.  He splattered.  Or my dick got caught in the railing and the helmet got ripped off.  That was, what day was that?  That was Friday.  That was right when we got there.  Kind of Friday, yeah.  Because Thursday.  Why did you feel like you had to have your dick out?  Why wouldn't you?  That's the question.  The breeze was nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It felt good on your balls.  Yeah, it was refreshing.  The nice fall air.  I was getting over an illness.  I was very sick.  Oh, you got to fucking cool off the fever bag. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I was, Thursday night, we did the show and I was going to come back.  So we left at about 10.30.  And, can I tell you the story?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We, uh.  Puking and construction and detours.  A nightmare.  Just a mess, huh?  Dude, I think we were lost for about 50 minutes in those fucking woods around the hotel.  Yeah, yeah.  How could you be lost?  I don't know, because somebody doesn't wear his glasses when he drives and when it says  next, it says 95 right lane. 
[00:08:00]  We have to make a left and then 95 south would have been in the right lane.  Can I stop you for a second?  Isn't it one road to Foxwoods, basically?  No.  Not at that point.  95 and then what?  There's a bunch of roads or is it one road leading to Foxwoods?  It's a six mile road from 95 to 2.  And why doesn't he have GPS yet?  Because he has the OnStar, which is hideous.  It's like you.  You don't use that unless your nav is broken.  Here's what happens.  We're supposed to make a left and then stay in the right lane in the 95 south.  Yeah.  Which would have put us on route 2 to 95 south. 
[00:08:30]  Sure.  But he says he sees right lane sign and fucking panicky Pete in a rainstorm makes the right.  It was like the fucking, it was like a Rock the Rocky Horror Show.  Stupid Brad and Janet.  Yeah.  And as we're riding on these back roads, I'm starting to feel like queasy.  And I'm like, I'm getting like really queasy.  And he goes, let's turn around and go back.  But we had gone like three miles.  I'm like, no, just call in your OnStar.  So when you call in the OnStar, it's a live operator and it gives you one line at a time. 
[00:09:00]  At a time.  It's stupid.  So we're doing these, we're in these back roads.  And we're doing these twisty, turny roads.  And I'm like, pull over.  It's pouring rain.  I'm nauseous.  And it's like because of the rain and the headlights and the fucking trees, I'm looking through a tunnel with just rain falling.  And it was like fucking vertigo.  So I'm like, stop.  And he kept stopping.  And I was just getting out in that rainstorm Thursday night, standing there, trying to make myself puke just to get it up.  I couldn't puke.  Like that.  Oh, God.  You weren't able to do that. 
[00:09:30]  No.  Look at that guy.  Look at that power booting photos.  I was trying to, and I could not get the vomit out.  So I kept getting back in the car.  That's my favorite, by the way.  Sorry to interrupt.  It's moshing guy puking out his nose and mouth.  It's a classic.  It's been around for years.  It almost looks like a frat guy.  I think that could be like one of the first like internet pictures.  Like I remember seeing that when I had like AOL in 1994.  Just laughing your balls off.  It's a major power boot.  I laughed really hard after it took 15 minutes to download.  The wrong guy looks like a Florentine on the end. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Young Florentine.  A little bit.  So you never puked?  No, I did, but not until I get back.  I couldn't puke standing there.  I kept trying to puke, and I couldn't puke.  So there was one point where I had him stop probably three times in a 10-minute period or a 5-minute period.  It was that bad.  I would have made a long ride home.  But every time we tried to get back to the hotel, because we finally just put the drive.  I'm like, fuck it.  Just take me back to the hotel.  I can't make this trip.  And we would hit, how many road closures?  Two road closures?  It was like, it was like.  Why were they closing the road up there?  I don't know. 
[00:10:30]  It's the middle of the night, and it's a rainstorm.  And there's woods.  Yeah, what are they doing?  Dude, it was so.  What, did the deer need to cross some highways?  So.  There were no highways.  These were like one-lane roads.  And we got back to the hotel, I think, 50 minutes after we had left.  And I just went up to the room, and I made myself vomit.  It was like that 24-hour bug.  That sucks.  But it was fucking, I can't remember ever being that queasy.  It was fucking horrendous.  Worst ride of my life.  Club was amazing, though.  But the. 
[00:11:00]  Good spot.  Fucking loved it, dude.  Crowds were good.  Fans were good.  Yeah, it's a brand new club.  Patrice was there the week before.  I think Nick is there next week.  And they got a great lineup.  That's a strong lineup.  And they treat comedians nicely.  It was fucking so rare to walk into a place where the staff is friendly.  And they're happier there.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm like, who are you expecting?  The comedy show?  That's because it just opened.  Give them time.  Give them time to get other comedians.  Oh, yeah.  To get Jaden to realize all you comedians are just scum.  Complete assholes. 
[00:11:30]  They're the same people that have comics in New York.  So they understand comics.  I really was.  So it's comics that is expanding?  It's called comics, yeah.  Damn.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That's very good for those guys.  So it was.  I loved it, man.  I loved being up there.  And I actually had a great time.  Normally at clubs, you just do them, you do them.  But this was.  It was great, man.  The crowds were fucking great.  Yeah.  Bumped.  I missed this one.  Yeah, you should have come, man.  It was really good.  That would have been a good one to go to.  And we got to get Kenny some GPS.  Enough of the odds.  Dude, I gave him a TomTom one time. 
[00:12:00]  Enough.  And they're not the greatest, but the TomToms are okay.  Something.  He just won't use it.  He won't use that or his glasses.  How about we get it installed in his car?  Yeah.  Doesn't that car just come?  Like, can't you have that car with nav in it?  Like, couldn't you have ordered that car with the factory installed navigation system?  It was completely my fault what happened Thursday night.  I took a wrong turn.  I wasn't blaming myself.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy made it.  You don't have to take the blame. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I think Jimmy made it very clear whose problem that was.  But doesn't your make of car have an option where you could have factory installed GPS?  Yeah, but at the time I purchased the vehicle, there were no vehicles on the lot.  Oh, you wanted to.  So how long would it have taken you to wait a little?  Yeah, but it was circumstances.  Like, my son turned 17, so I was giving him my old truck, and I had to purchase a new truck immediately.  And it was at the time where, like, GM was, all the car companies were bankrupt and, you know, because the economy and everything. 
[00:13:00]  Can't you go back now and have a factory installed GPS put into your vehicle?  So it's not, you know, like some schleppy thing or wires around or anything.  It's too grand.  You could get, like, a, you know.  A Tom Tom for nothing, because you have one.  No, I have Jimmy's Tom Tom, and it, you know.  He uses the Ken Ken.  Yeah, exactly.  Glasses and line-by-line directions.  Which makes the wrong turn turn.  Yeah.  If I didn't make that wrong turn, he probably would have been fine, because. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, but you wouldn't have made that wrong turn with a GPS.  Correct.  Thank God you don't drive a lot, so you don't really need the GPS.  I would have gotten sick anyway, though.  That nausea hit me.  You know what it hits you when all of a sudden you feel sick?  Like, I don't feel too good.  And then your entire body is covered in a sheen.  Yeah, yeah.  Of cooling sweat.  And you're like, that's puke feeling.  And then you feel it, like, in your stomach, you're like, and your throat starts closing up.  You're like, oh, I'm going to fucking puke.  It was worse because we were going in circles on mountain roads. 
[00:14:00]  But even going straight down 95, I would have gotten sick.  Because I was sick when I got back to the room.  Yeah.  And the next day I still felt sick.  But I just, I felt, I felt better by showtime.  Yeah.  But I didn't even feel, I only ate once until showtime.  I didn't even feel safe eating before the show.  You should have seen poor little Jimmy.  They're bringing out, like, we ordered our main course at Paragon.  And then they just kept bringing out, the chef kept coming out and bringing out appetizer after appetizer.  Just amazing stuff.  And Jimmy's like, you know, no, I got to, you know, I'm doing a show and I wasn't feeling good. 
[00:14:30]  And he said, well, that looks delicious.  And he grabbed it and eats some.  Fish, wonton, all this great food.  It was amazing.  But the chef said, like, all the food came from, like, around the world.  Like, they just had, like, the fresh crab legs, like, flown in from the deadliest catch boats.  Yeah, yeah.  And he got truffles from wherever he got them.  Truffles were great.  The goddamn king crab legs were silly.  Like a caveman, I was ripping those apart.  I ate those.  Because those are bland enough where you can eat them where they're not, like, too oily, like an al dente thing. 
[00:15:00]  There was some stuff I was just nervous because it was fried.  Very nervous.  Yeah.  And the steak was amazing, wasn't it, Ken?  I think in my 53 years on earth, that was arguably the best piece of meat I've ever had.  Wow.  Look at you.  Quite the endorsement.  That would have been better if you didn't say arguably.  Arguably.  I said arguably.  Arguably.  Isn't he terrific?  The food was amazing, though.  It was fucking great.  Sounds like a good weekend.  I had to wake up early this morning, like, right after. 
[00:15:30]  I was up when Kenny called.  I'm going to give him my wake-up call because I got home, really didn't do anything but crapped right out once the car dropped us off.  When did you get home?  About six-ish.  Oh, Sunday.  Okay.  Six-ish.  And just by seven, I was in bed asleep.  I was pretty exhausted.  We do that.  Our timeline completely flips nocturnal.  We're up in the day, nighttime, completely asleep in the daytime. 
[00:16:00]  And, again, I got to say, these Asians and their cigarettes, they can't stop.  So I woke up this morning.  I'm just like, just reeking of smoke.  Oh, you're allowed to smoke up there?  Indian casinos love the smoking because they sell the cigarettes.  Oh, yeah.  They sell the cigarettes.  They don't have a non-smoking area?  Oh, yeah, they do.  Yeah, they do.  But it doesn't really matter.  It doesn't matter.  You've got to walk through the area.  Right, right.  I mean, and if you've got to walk through the slot machine area to get to the tables, there's Asians with, like, eight cigarettes per hand. 
[00:16:30]  Just, whoa, whoa, clouds of smoke you're walking through.  And so I had to get up early and wash that filth off of me.  And warsh?  Warsh.  I had a warsh.  Why didn't you warsh when you got home yesterday?  Too goddamn tired.  A big, nice, long, fucking hot shower.  I was exactly...  Get all the slime off.  I had no energy to lift my hands to shampoo my hair.  I was done.  I had to just crap out.  And then I slept from, like, 7.30 until I got up this morning.  Showtime.  So it was a nice, long sleep.  Long sleep.  How many hours at the table? 
[00:17:00]  Many, many.  I think Saturday.  It was from Friday after Jimmy's show.  Started right away.  When did Jimmy's show end?  The early show, so...  It was the only one show.  Oh, Friday, right.  That's right.  9.30.  8 o'clock.  Done by 9.30.  So about 10 o'clock I started, and I went until about 10 o'clock the next morning.  Holy shit.  So it was a good overnight, 12 hours straight.  We went and talked to him a little while after the late show.  Yes.  And he was... 
[00:17:30]  It wasn't his best night, I guess, at the tables.  They were beating him pretty badly.  Yeah.  Was there yelling and screaming?  Was there a pillow involved?  No, it wasn't that bad.  It was more like, why are you doing this?  How do you get that?  And I was actually with him.  I'm like, how the fuck do they get these cards?  I'd whip my head around, look at Jimmy Oldman and go, did you see that?  Dude.  He would get a jack and a four.  What do you do with that shit?  And then you'd see the dealer with a jack, and you'd know what's underneath.  A four and then a seven.  Yeah.  Or just an ace or whatever. 
[00:18:00]  It really is amazing when they get on those runs.  Jesus.  I did get on a really good run, though, by about six in the morning.  So from six in the morning till ten in the morning, I was really just pounding them.  And Keith kept just grabbing stacks of chips, going back to the cage, paying off markers.  And then he'd come back from paying off the marker.  I'd have another stack of chips.  He'd grab them, go back.  So it was working really well.  It was like a nice assembly line we had going.  But then it was just to the point where we were fucking exhausted, and I was working 
[00:18:30]  on like five espressos, because they stopped serving booze.  I know.  They stopped serving booze at like 1.30.  Do they really?  Yeah.  So there was no more booze at the table, so I'm just like, let me have an espresso.  So they bring one, and I just kept going, another espresso.  Another espresso.  Did you need the booze, though, really?  I was, uh, it never hurts.  Your desk really needed the booze?  Never hurts.  Maybe you have to get a flask.  A flask.  I think you're heading into a flask.  No, there are a thing.  There are ways around things.  We'll just put it that way.  I would imagine there are. 
[00:19:00]  There are ways around things.  It's Danny Smiles, yes.  There are ways around things.  Five espressos, though?  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  So I was just shaking.  I'm like, ah!  And then just exhausted, so I went back to the room.  I would love to know the numbers.  I know you don't talk numbers.  I never talk numbers, but it was, yeah.  Big numbers.  I took a beating.  It wasn't giant, but it was a good, it was one of those beatings where I was like, you  know, I'm not feeling it.  I'm cutting my losses.  Was the number big enough where you technically paid for everything this weekend? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, probably, yeah.  I know you've had weekends where you basically didn't pay for nothing and brought some cash  home.  Some cake home.  But it's safe to say that pretty much you paid for your way this time.  Put it this way.  If I had to pay for that room, that was crazy enough, so I was very happy about that.  They don't really charge anyone for that room, right?  Isn't it for the high rollers, mostly?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I don't think anybody ever pays for that room.  Right, right.  But if you had to pay for it, wow.  Yeah, I saw the picture of it.  Holy shit.  Fucking unbelievable. 
[00:20:00]  Holy shit.  Chocolate-covered pretzels.  When you get in, in Anthony, in my room, no chocolate-covered pretzels.  But here's the difference.  Jimmy, very excited about the chocolate-covered pretzels.  What were you excited about in the room, Anthony?  Right there, the bar area.  Exactly.  I took a pano shot.  See how different these two are.  I'll plug that app, too.  Let me tell you something.  There's an app called Pano for iPhone, and you can take pictures in almost 360 degrees.  Well, you can in 360 degrees, and it stitches it together. 
[00:20:30]  So that is a panoramic shot of part of the room.  That's without the bedrooms or anything.  Can I tell you something about this app?  I saw this picture on your Twitter, and I really thought it was a picture from the website.  Yeah.  It has that feel like that would be the top of the website.  Yeah.  You can see there's a dining room way in the back, and then if you keep going around that  corner, there's a bedroom.  Giant bedroom.  Right.  And just a great room.  Nice bar.  Which fully stocked.  And anything we needed.  Like, we got up, there was no Captain Morgan.  Called down. 
[00:21:00]  Some Captain Morgan, please.  Boom.  They bring it right up.  You're forgetting something.  Circle what you can see on the table, Dan.  In the white box, for the love of Christ.  Those are the pretzels.  The pretzels are actually there.  The chocolate-covered pretzels.  The chocolate-covered pretzels are in the shot, thank God.  So it doesn't look like all debauchery.  And that's a 180 shot.  That wasn't even what was behind me or anything.  I know.  We can figure that out.  That's tremendous.  That's amazing.  That looks like a website shot, though.  You're right.  Yeah.  Like the top of a website, right?  Yeah.  Too bad the view was kind of bad, huh?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Fucking over these.  It's a forest.  Do you ever see, at the end of Cuckoo's Nest, that where he was, it was all these trees.  That's exactly what this place reminded me of, where Cuckoo's Nest was set.  Fucking A, man.  Oh, it was fucking fantastic.  I hadn't been to Foxwoods in 10 years.  I went there with Ben Bailey many years ago to do a gig.  And when I walked in the building, the first time I went, I'm like, you don't want to leave.  It's like a weird vibe that the building has.  That's what they try to do.  Yeah.  That's their goal, to make sure you never leave until you're broke.  Until you're nauseous, the building calls you back. 
[00:22:00]  That's what happened.  I was trying to come home.  I'm like, if I was a gambler, you know how spooked I'd be by this?  Because I got sick and the building made me come back.  They made you come back.  It's like lost.  Did you guys go on any hikes or anything?  What?  Huh?  Yes, I did.  You were in the middle of the woods.  There must be some nice hikes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some nice hiking trails.  I went fucking from my room down to Junior's, which was like the Junior's in New York.  And ate deli food.  It was fucking amazing.  And I ate there every day. 
[00:22:30]  Was your room good?  Yeah.  Turned out all right?  Yeah.  Ant's was better because his was in the newer part of the hotel, the Pequot suite.  Yes, the Pequot Towers.  But mine was, they gave me a nice fucking huge room.  It's as big as my apartment.  You guys steal anything from the hotel rooms?  You don't steal when they bring you the stuff.  Did you borrow stuff?  Ah, we might have taken some bottles of booze that were around.  You know, if there's a full bottle of Captain Morgan, why wouldn't I take it and put it  in my bar at home?  You know, but it's not like I'm shoving towels and soap in there. 
[00:23:00]  You know?  I never take from hotel rooms.  It's weird.  Yeah.  Why would you?  I don't know why.  Some stuff is really nice, Ben.  You say, in a room like his?  Fuck me.  I would take the sofa in that fucking room.  Into a moving van.  You just walk through the casino with the mattress.  Because he really liked it.  And they'd probably let him.  Yeah, they'd probably let him.  Enjoy the mattress, Mr. Coyote.  You should test him next time.  Have fun.  You should absolutely test him.  Yeah.  Just fucking take the mattress and walk through the casino and see.  And then you show them your credentials. 
[00:23:30]  They're like, okay, I'm sorry.  What were we thinking?  Dude, the chef came over to the table before we ate.  Yeah.  That's what happens when you're a high roller.  They really make you feel good.  The comic, I'm lucky the fucking waitress came over at Junior's.  The high roller, though, in that amazing restaurant we ate at.  And you never even have to, you don't have to pick appetizers because you're getting every appetizer.  They bring it over for everybody and then clear it away.  And the next one comes in.  Must be nice.  Brajute. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, the brajute.  They melt in your mouth.  That was fucking good.  Everything was amazing.  Grilled cheese, even.  And a little thing of grilled cheese and some ham on the side, which sounds like it would be very amateurish.  Amazing.  Yeah, you're eating it going, this is the best grilled cheese.  Fuck.  We had a great time.  Had a really good time.  They treated us like gold.  It was great. </pre>
