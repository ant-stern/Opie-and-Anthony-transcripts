<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony Cumia and Greg Hughes, with Jim Norton filling in for Opie, heavily discussing Eric Nagel's wedding.  They dissected the guest list, noting the absence of Danny Ross, Travis Tiff, and D-Boy, while highlighting the presence of Tim Sabean (from the Howard Stern Show).  Much of the conversation revolved around speculating on the reasons behind these inclusions and omissions, punctuated by jokes about the potential awkwardness of the situation.  Bill Burrâ€™s possible attendance was discussed, ultimately deemed uncertain.  The best man situation was a key comedic point, initially Roland, who bowed out due to a Harry Potter movie premiere conflict, leaving the replacement a mystery.  Opie's prostate issues, a misogynistic movie anecdote, a Bar Nine gig, and various personal anecdotes were also shared. The hosts' contrasting relationships with Nagel were explored in relation to the guest list. The segment concluded with further wedding discussion and plans for the evening, including attending a Harry Potter movie.


The show then transitioned into a discussion about guest bookings. The hosts debated the securing of Zachary Levi ("Chuck"), the potential appearance of Kevin Nealon and Kevin Smith, and the challenges in getting established celebrities like Edward Norton and Ricky Gervais.  A heated exchange regarding the producer's role in guest selection ensued.  Kevin Nealon was in-studio, and Kevin Smith called in.  Zachary Levi's appearance was heavily debated.  The conversation diverged into a discussion of the "Situation" from "The Jersey Shore" attempting serious acting, comparing it to athletes' often-unsuccessful sitcom appearances (Keith Hernandez on *Seinfeld* was mentioned), and Stephen Slater's infamous rap song.  The segment shockingly concluded with extended snippets of Charles Manson's music, prompting a discussion of his life, crimes, and his mother's appearance.  This unexpected shift in tone followed lighthearted banter, with Jimmy's broken headphones providing ongoing comedic relief.  A substantial portion focused on the addictive nature of "Angry Birds," with a caller sharing his experience.


The next segment featured a conversation focusing on the guests' show business experiences, particularly their late-night and variety show appearances.  A comedian recounted his *Saturday Night Live* experience, detailing the audition process, interactions with cast members (Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks, and Darryl Hammond), and his departure.  The discussion covered the difficulties of breaking into show business and maintaining a stand-up career, along with anecdotes about odd jobs (grave digging, air conditioning installation, Dunkin' Donuts).  Encounters with Bill Murray and a humorous story about pretending to be air conditioning repairmen to access a comedy club were shared.  Kevin Smith called in, discussing *Red State*, its actors (Michael Parks, John Goodman, Melissa Leo), and his film industry experiences.  Kevin Nealon shared a story about police responding to a noise complaint from a loud scene in *From Dusk Till Dawn*.  Joe DeRosa and Zachary Levi made brief in-studio appearances.  The language used was frequently profane.


A segment featuring Zachary Levi followed, promoting *Tangled*. He discussed his career, theater background, post-divorce dating (using Disney musicals), and humorous banter about hoarding, *Cats*, and video games (*Call of Duty: Black Ops*).  He detailed his *Tangled* voice work and his new company, "Nerd Machine."  After his departure, the hosts angrily discussed a negative encounter with Levi's publicist, describing her entitled behavior, including interrupting the interview to promote Levi's website and threatening to prevent Levi's appearance if she wasn't allowed in the studio.  They debated the publicist's competence and whether her actions reflected poorly on Levi, whom they found pleasant. The conversation concluded with further discussion about the publicist, other celebrities, conspiracy theories, and a childhood school play anecdote.


The show concluded with a discussion about hair plugs and plastic surgery, referencing Gene Wilder and joking about the risks.  A Pat Oswald joke about a plastic surgery show altering appearances to resemble celebrities led to speculation about ideal choices (Paul Newman, Brad Pitt).  The hosts discussed the irony of physical flaws becoming assets in show business (Jamie Farr's nose, Mike Tyson).  A critique of a doctor's character in *Cannonball Run* and comments on Marty Feldman's appearance and career followed.  The hosts then plugged upcoming appearances at the Borgata, Tropicana, and *Righteous Kill*, discussing terrible movie lines from *Over the Edge* and *Shark Attack 3*.  A digression about *The Car* trailer ensued, followed by anecdotes about Bobby Kelly's unusual gadget purchases (a jacket-pillow, compartmentalized forks).  They promoted their shows and speculated on a groom vomiting at an upcoming wedding. The segment ended with reminiscing about a canceled show and closing remarks.

[00:10:30]  because i remember  there was a little bit  of a controversy  because he could make it  to opie's wedding  i think  that's  yeah and then if he went  to eric nagel's wedding  oh my god  oh my dear sweet jesus christ  on a cross  it is quite the guest list  uh and  of  people who were invited  it is quite the lack  of a guest list too  because i just found this out  oh are we gossipy  little girdies  we really are  fucking little girdies  oh we just gossipy girdies  with this one  what i find out is  that um 
[00:11:00]  our own  danny ross  and travis teff  not invited  and  along with  d-boy  d-boy  also not invited  to the wedding  well mars  you know  mars are you invited  no  but wait i mean  what do you expect  mars isn't gonna get invited  why not  maybe his wife  could make a cake  and he could've  saved money  he was invited  to wash the dishes  oh  oh damn  oh shit  talking about his background  and how they all  wash dishes  oh shit  oh shit 
[00:11:30]  kenny were you invited  yes  kenny was invited  i was invited  i'm going  now what is the difference  between the likes of a  sam roberts  wait a minute  was troy invited  troy quan  was troy invited  troy  yes  yes  troy was invited  what a willy nilly  um  sort of invite list  but  i see a pattern here  what's that  i don't know  i don't know 
[00:12:00]  but i do see  now danny's not invited  correct  travis not invited  correct  and d-boy not invited  that's a little odd  like do you guys speak to eric  like you talked right  yes  as much as i would think  sam would  on a professional level  do you guys talk much socially  like outside of the boundaries  of the program  we have  met socially  okay  what about  troy  does troy  troy  troy's actually known eric  for like 14 years  what  yeah  how 
[00:12:30]  they go back to uh  back to the old days  no not scott and todd  no no no no no no  back to like uh  when when troy was in pennsylvania  i'll be a trot  come on in troy  i want to know this  wow what's this relationship  you have with mr nagel  with the nagel family  yeah i've known him about 14 years  how'd you meet him  uh we met through  i was in a band  and he worked for college radio  you were in a band  and he was getting one  on his stomach  c because he's fat 
[00:13:00]  yes no that's what he was getting  from the buffet  all right so you were in a band  that he worked for college radio  and he had some way of rigging  cmj because back in the day  that's how they would sort of uh  uh when you were in a band  and you wanted to be noticed  see they would look at cmj  and he had a way of rigging it  so uh i don't know how he did it  but he started doing that  and then i started working  with this other band  that he uh 
[00:13:30]  he was doing the same thing for  so you uh you you were one of those  bands that thought  a college radio guy  could get you somewhere  well at least it would help you  start charting  so you would show up on the cmj charts  and then labels would go  again you thought a college jock  could get you somewhere  well  where'd you get  uh  because i was in the same boat  yeah  well i used to do college radio shows  and things like that  and they help you 
[00:14:00]  no  they stunk  they weren't even good jocks  you know it's a gamble  interview anybody  you know you're just trying  you're just trying to make a name  for yourself so  yeah i know the game my friend  but uh  wow you've known him that long  yeah  all right  i didn't know you guys were uh  like old buddy buddy  what uh  wouldn't you love to hear  those fucking air checks  from back when he was a college radio guy  oh  oh  do you have any of those  like from your own stuff  being plenty of  i would  i love to hear  i want to hear some  nagle  you know eric has all of them 
[00:14:30]  but he pretends he doesn't  oh yeah i know  i mean he used to  he trades radio tapes  of course he has every  he has every minute  that he's been on the internet  wait he trades radio tapes  well he did before  yeah  with who  he's an old  he like he'd go on the internet  who wants them  and he'd trade like  when he was a teenager  he would tape  four radio shows  like he used to tape  scott and todd  and all kinds of shows  and trade radio tapes  on the internet  would he sell them  he'd trade them  for what  who the fuck  hey do you have scott and todd  tuesday the 8th  yeah  no that's exactly  what they would do  he would trade radio tapes 
[00:15:00]  from what shows  would he want  i don't know  i mean there used to be  when we could get to his website  there used to be a massive list  of what he had  and what he wanted  wow  like he was serious about it  he was a big radio tape trader  he's still big but  well  he's still a traitor  bigger than ever  really  yeah  he is  but he knows him  for 14 years  he could say what he wants  wow  eric's interesting  there's a lot of layers  for that little fat kid  oh there certainly are  a lot of layers  because he's got secrets  that's right 
[00:15:30]  he keeps secrets  he does  he's got secrets about himself  because isn't he a gossipy  little gertie too  very gossipy  but for other people  like he doesn't expose  anything about himself  the mysterious nagel  yeah  yeah  plus he always like  he talks in like code  when like he keeps details  that there's no reason to keep  like he keeps secrets  that are not like  it's not a secret  with him  like he'll talk like  well  so and so said so  and you're like  and when he acts like  there's something going on  it's a complete non-event  it's nothing  like a really weird 
[00:16:00]  like I was in the kitchen before  and uh  and Robin Quivers walked in  and um  you know  what happened  nah she got some coffee  I got a pretzel  is that the story  and he pulled you aside  and that's what he pulled you aside  that's a horrible story  she got some coffee  I got a beef shank  eric eric also is known  for his  his terrible practical jokes  like if you do something  that pisses him off  what's happening tonight  like you can fuck with him  pretty hard  or something will happen  it'll piss him off  and then like  eric's big version of revenge 
[00:16:30]  is like he'll uh  you know  he'll turn your monitor  facing backwards  and they'll be like  got you pretty good  or a celebrity will come in  and he'll be like  hey could Sam get a picture  with you  and then he's like  I got you back  and I'm like  yeah but I got a picture  with it  eric totally got  eric totally got D-boy  a couple months ago  by having him get a picture  with MC Hammer  face  face  nailed  and like two weeks ago  you guys were making fun of him  on the air  and he just played a sweeper  for no reason  during the show  yeah yeah  that was him getting back  he got us  but I like the exclusivity 
[00:17:00]  of the wedding  it makes me feel like  I'm going to a  an event that is  a place to be seen  you know what  you got on the other side  of the velvet row  I am  the likes of  you know  the scum  have to stand outside  we're not standing outside waiting  no I didn't think you were  we're just somewhere else  all you guys can do  is watch from afar  go to bar nine Danny  I guess  I've got no other plans  come on show up  we'll have a pisser  yeah so 
[00:17:30]  I see  I see  because we've noticed  over the years  there's a couple of camps here  just click  the place can  tend to be a bit clicky  as they say  a little clicky  it is  and poor Mars  doesn't belong to any  nobody wants him  he would love to  you can tell too  because when it's just  Opie in the room  he tries to kiss his ass  when it's just you in the room  he's trying to kiss your ass  he just  he just wants to be in the camp  I thought just conversation  no he just wants to work  in the kitchen of either camp 
[00:18:00]  he doesn't get  oh shit  oh yeah  yeah it is a little clicky  and I've noticed like  you know  the people that  tend to frequent  my house  not invited to the wedding  you're right  as a matter of fact  I showed up at your  Halloween party  I probably almost  lost myself an invitation  you really  if you would have  stayed longer  you uh  you showed up for  I believe you were there  for 16 minutes  well I had to go  and do a show 
[00:18:30]  well whatever  whatever  at 9 o'clock  yeah at 9 o'clock  yeah  we were there  at like 5  I was there  yeah I was there at 5  I stayed for like  an hour and a half  and then I had to  drive in here  oh what a long drive  and then I had to  prep for a show  it was on this channel  it was nice to see  Jess with her little  bunny ears  that was very cute  she did have bunny ears  on  Jessica Rabbit  that's what she was  Jessica Rabbit  Jessica Rabbit  her name's Jessica  I know  when is uh  one of the uh  nuptials taking place  uh 
[00:19:00]  we're not engaged  Sam Roberts  so  the Roberts wedding  it would be a little  uh  uh  early to set a wedding day  when there's no engagement  is there any talk  about uh  engagements in your life  or anything  well I mean  we've been dating  does mommy allow it  will your mommy  she would be absolutely  fine with it  yes  really  would she insist  on giving you  her engagement ring  to give to Jess  with a dress  do you think she'd  make it with a dress  yeah yeah  she might if she ever  some oldie time  little house on the prairie  traditional dress 
[00:19:30]  he has to bow Jess  in the dress  and his mom wore  is she just staying  on the back  right by the ass part  and he's like  oh no  what happened  oh it's sardines  and buttermilk  there's cracker crumbs  by the crotch  oh no  oh that would be  terrible  no she has no  engagement ring  to uh  what  for Jess to wear  so  why doesn't your mommy  have an engagement ring  because my dad  proposed over the phone  and then  of course he did  it's just more mystique  he's a cheap skater 
[00:20:00]  he didn't want to buy a ring  he really is a skin flint  did he make her  stick her finger  through his little mustache  through the curly part  and be like  oh will you marry me  it's like the ring  for the night  he clipped it off  no cause they were dating  I guess  when they were living  in Detroit  dating means having sex  by the way  I mean I'm sure  they were back in the car  yeah  and then  Detroit  the Studebaker  that's great  Detroit  yeah  romance city  they call it  yeah  oh god  they get sucker punched  and robbed  that's right  they'd park an 8 mile 
[00:20:30]  and she'd blow them  oh that's horrible  sorry  no it's fair  wow  and then my dad  moved to California  and once he got out there  I think he got a cold  and he got  that's the place  you ought to be  yeah  but then he called her  and asked her to marry him  so then he went back  to Detroit  married her  and then brought her  back to California  what the fuck  is that about  that's how  I'll tell you what happens  when you leave  and you realize  that like the sex  you're having  is not as good  as the stuff back home  you gotta go back  California sex  doesn't beat Detroit sex 
[00:21:00]  I guess not  I think hands down  it does  maybe  depends on what people like  you never know  I mean  could be some fetish there  no I don't know  I think it was more  traditionalist  here it is  his dad's very traditional  and I think the California chicks  little too wild  for pops  you think so  little too wild  did he have his wild streak  apparently they used to throw  like parties  every single weekend  before they had kids  Tupperware parties  I don't know what  your swinger parties  oh yeah  hotel keys  yeah please 
[00:21:30]  Detroit  cuckold city  oh wow  I didn't know about this  no so  so even over all these years  he never decided to  you know  no he said  fuck that  no  fuck that  yeah no  never decided  wow  so she doesn't have  an engagement ring  so I won't have to  worry about that  what about wedding band  type thing  they got that  yeah it's just like  a plain wedding band  plain  yeah  plain Jane  little gold band  yeah that's it  just a plain gold band  now that doesn't mean  you're gonna you know  be the same thing 
[00:22:00]  you've been with Jess  how long now  over five years  five years  do you say you love her  yes  and she says I know  no  she doesn't pull  no she responds  appropriately  come on  she responds  okay  after five years  she's still  alright  she's just uncomfortable  when I bring it up  I thought she gave you  the old Han Solo  I love you  I know  and then frozen  yeah  gone  I know  that was his line 
[00:22:30]  yeah  I know  that's pretty funny  it was a great line  it's like fuck you  I'm being frozen  carbonite  I know  or carbon  I know  he backed up his computer  or something  I don't know  no that's carbonite  this is different  oh literal James  guy who gets angry  at the jokes  well when one comes out  let me know  so Eric  it's weird  how did Eric invite  certain people  I could never invite  Troy and not Sam  or Sam and not Travis  it's weird  it's awkward 
[00:23:00]  if I was  to have a wedding  I would invite  either all the staff  or none of the staff  yeah  it would be too awkward  I would probably  go for all  yeah  even the little  glistening snot  under your nose  wouldn't stop you  I'm doing that  I'll wipe that now  poor Sam is a cold  oh  you're a little sniffly  yeah he is  but you know what  not getting invited  to Eric's wedding  saves me at least  a hundred dollars  at the very least  well yeah  figure a gift  a babysitter  Jesus Christ  what year is this  yeah  a hundred bucks 
[00:23:30]  at least I say  well I mean  you know it's Eric  a gift  a babysitter  what would you  give him a little  cash in the envelope  yeah  what like ten bucks  well for Eric  yeah  yeah I've been  trying to talk  Jess down  an amount  oh you're really  oh yeah  I could only imagine  the conversations  that take place  with the people  for the gift  because I have to tell  her I'm like look  we both know  Eric and me  work at the same place  and he makes  significantly more money  than me  oh  oh god that's  supposed to be  a great discussion  so wow  cheapskate  the hot chick 
[00:24:00]  it's like a 70s film  with James Caan  she doesn't want  to be embarrassed  because she's friends  with his bride-to-be  and I'm like look  oh that's right  there's that dynamic too  yeah  how much is the difference  between what you want  to give and what she  wants to give  I would probably like  to give half  of what she wants  to give  wow  wow  so I'm gonna guess  Jess wants to give  200 and Sam wants  to give 100  that's my guess  that's a  yeah it's more or less  and 100  it's like a con  I'm like look  I don't want to give  100 but  look  for what he does 
[00:24:30]  around here  he makes a lot  more money than me  by the way  this is one of  the invited guests  imagine what the  uninvited guests  would have been thinking  Troy has made it clear  that he's not  bringing a gift  this evening  Troy no gift  whatsoever  well technically  I have a year  to deliver a gift  so  but he did  he said to Eric's face  technically I have a year  and hopefully  you'll forget by then  that's good  because you're not  getting one  times are tough  and I know he makes  a lot of money  tough economy right now  very tough  more than you  absolutely 
[00:25:00]  probably double  that's yeah  he doesn't need it  then yeah  that's kind of a weird  thing to give money  to somebody  and let's not forget  he also stole  $100,000 from us  yeah I told him that too  that is true  I said take my 100  out of the daily newspaper  that is true  years ago  he did win a  daily news  $100,000  $100,000  using a show  newspaper  and it was a show  newspaper  which all the fans  still think  that's why everybody  makes fun of him  because we're all  jealous that he won  the lottery 
[00:25:30]  wouldn't be  that's it  does he still have  any of that money  come on  he invested in  property in Florida  the old homestead  really  does he do good  it's a condo  where is it  his father has money  he's smart  so he might  his dad  he comes from  a very good place  of course  he's loaded  he can afford it  when he started  working at XM  he bought a ton  of stock  for like $13  a share  so he's not  that smart  with money  that's so great 
[00:26:00]  it's father price  it's starting  that steak  for yourself  it's creeping up  but wow  that might take  a little while  he did that whole  thing where  you take X amount  of dollars  out of your paycheck  and it just  automatically goes  into buying  more stock  pre-tax  so you save  a lot of money  that's great  it's exactly  what Enron did  perfect  is that what they did  wonderful  oh yeah  they were giving you  the option to  either put it  in a sound  retirement fund  or just buy  this company stock  which is just  going through the roof  so people did  and this is another 
[00:26:30]  thing where it's like  alright  Enron  they were fucking  just despicable  criminals  but the greed  factor on the  employees  going like  well I could  slowly build my  retirement plan  over the years  or I could make  a fortune  overnight  was it a Ponzi  or no  no not so much  a Ponzi  as downright  out and out lies  oh really  yeah yeah  they were  juggling the books  making the stock  what do they call 
[00:27:00]  that  falsely inflating  the price  who was the head  of Enron  who was the big  name in that  it wasn't Kenneth  Eric Nagel  wow  yeah the head  of that  it was a fantastic  thing  yeah what the fuck  was his name  it was Dave Enron  was it Dave Enron  oh okay  it was not  Dave Enron  I knew that  didn't sound right  Dave  you should have  said Ted  Enron  it was me and  Ron  we're friends  Ted Enron  Travis told me  it's Ken Lay  it was Ken Lay 
[00:27:30]  I was right  yeah yeah  Ken Lay  is he in jail  I don't think so  were you hurt  not to be invited  Travis  honestly  no  Danny a little  bothered  that your co-worker  didn't ask you  I think they're  they're probably  not necessarily hurt  because they probably  in their heart  didn't specifically  want to go  but it is kind of  like  I'm amused  you're making it  like it's like  a very clear sign  it is a  like a  I'm in a quandary  about it  because it's like 
[00:28:00]  you would think  you'd invite the  entire staff  and then you don't  you're selective  here's the weird thing  especially with  like with Sam  because  like I  everybody thinks  that me and Eric  have like a thing  or something  and there's really  no thing  like I don't  I haven't  like the last time  I really got mad  at Eric  like legitimately  it was so long ago  I can't even remember  what it was over  like we're not best friends  he doesn't like  when you  demean his job  on the air  yeah but even  that happens  like once  in a blue moon 
[00:28:30]  for the most part  Sam however  blue moons every day  Sam  I don't really  I don't really hang on  I don't harp on Eric  too much  but Sam will bust  Eric's balls  every day of the week  and make fun of him  and just every time  you know  and like when  when Eric is in here  getting his balls busted  Sam's the one  in the background  going hey  you fat  hey  you stomach  and then  I don't get the invite  not like I care  but then Sam  and I see the same behavior  going on with Stevie  where Sam delivers Stevie 
[00:29:00]  all of the abuse  yeah  but then he hates me  yeah  and Travis  and I think you guys  get mad at Eric and Stevie  you're coming from a very angry  like you guys get very mad  and start yelling  and then people get hurt  whereas I'm just coming  from a silly place  because you're a baseball bat  to the head  whereas Sam is more of like  a slow stomach cancer  yeah  they don't understand  what he's doing  and by the time  it's too late  yeah it's just too late  I'm just being charming  you'd make a great  Manson or Hitler 
[00:29:30]  thank you  thank you  I'll take that as a compliment  I think so  who's rolling  we gotta get rolling in here  I have to hear how that went down  yeah  best man  who's the best man  I think  they must have been switched out  with his personal  okay  friends  but  was it  somebody that should have been  in the first place  yeah  is Dave going  Eastside Dave is going  Eastside Dave is going  Eastside Dave got the invite  which by the way  guarantees  the wedding will be  a horrid memory  he said  for everyone involved  Troy said he plans  on getting completely fucked up 
[00:30:00]  because of this open bar  who Dave or Troy  Troy plans on doing it  food will be good though  Dave you don't have to even tell  Eastside Dave also does  of course  and  he sat them at the table  with me  who I've been known  to instigate a couple things  so it's not gonna be  hey Dave  why don't you  and then  Troy  I think Dave's drinking  a little more than you  why don't you  yeah  you wanna see Dave get drunk  I wanna see  yeah  I wanna see the wedding get ruined  I hope that Dave  I hope Dave's asshole  is the ring bearer  oh yeah 
[00:30:30]  wouldn't that be great  she has to stick her finger  in his ass  to put the ring on  pull it out  and there it is  there's a pucker  right on  everyone cries  right on her little finger  well Roland's in studio  with  wow he's got a  Bruce Springsteen shirt on  Bruce  holy  Bruce  Bruce  so what happened  with  Eric's wedding  he asked you to be  the best man 
[00:31:00]  well  I'm gonna talk about  my private life  on air  oh girlfriend  let me tell you  yeah Roland's a  gossipy Gertie too  isn't he  we're all just  hens today  that's like  I'm the real housewives  yes  now you  you were asked  now did you  during my  during my  unemployment years  I cast away  where people feed you  you just like  nod your head  as you eat  so they go  want to go for 
[00:31:30]  food  down here  I'll buy your  waffles  oh so that was  the set up  to asking you  like you needed  a moment to long  I ate my waffles  and then I was  stuffing my face  because we're  getting married  I'm like  alright  you want to be  best man  pass the syrup  please  I mean  we're not  I mean  it was friends  but I'm  the next  butter  butter  you got  the butter  trying to have  a sensitive  moment  a poignant  moment  with Roland  and Roland's  just grabbing  condiments 
[00:32:00]  off the table  he's like  trying to talk  to Billy Bob  Thornton's  sling blades  what's going  best man  don't you need  somebody  who you know  for a long  time  well you're  closer to  right  yeah closer  like my  buddy David  or my  buddy Kevin  we like  half way  grew up  with each  other  from 15  years old  on up  so I'm like  alright  well you get  free food  there  I'm like  I don't know  how long  I want to be  unemployed  so I'm like  free food  I'm like  I guess so  but there are  expenses that  come with being  a best man  I didn't know 
[00:32:30]  that  and responsibility  I didn't know  that either  until I googled  away and I  called my  brother  what's the best  man  he goes  like four  grand  I'm like  fuck  girlfriend  you have to  take him out  to dinners  and this  you have to  do the  bachelor party  you have to  get him a  gift  I'll show you  my underwear  with a big  shift stainless  I don't know  how much it  costs  the toast  you know  you can make  or break a  wedding  it doesn't  matter  all the  niggles are  niggles are  drunks  he just 
[00:33:00]  thought best  man meant  he was going  to get to  go to the  wedding and  have a front  row seat  he had won  something  he's just  show up and  high five  everybody  like Danny  thought  you just  hang out  top shelf  liquor  pound down  a bunch  Eric lied  and told him  Bruce was  his wedding  band  okay  I know  well they  said that  there would  be a band  who played  Bruce  that was  selling  points  but now  it's a DJ  who plays  80's music  I think  I know why 
[00:33:30]  Roland was  asked to be  best man  all the pieces  are coming  together  Troy you  weren't asked  to be  best man  were you  invited to  the dinner  last night  no  14 fucking  years  I was  invited to  the dinner  last night  but I  couldn't go  but he  knew I  couldn't go  to the  wedding  so I  think he  invited me  for that  but I  had to  work  so I  couldn't  go  but he  also  invited  Hope  to the  dinner  yeah  which makes  me  and Roland's  the best  man  which makes  me think  that Eric  doesn't really  have a semblance  of who's a  close friend  and not  Eric is looking  at the people  who can do  things  yes 
[00:34:00]  or like he  wants people  who have  careers in  show business  he wants  Roland who knows  celebrities  he can be the  best man  this is networking  I don't think I was  invited to the  dinner was I  oh I shouldn't have  said anything then  did you go  no I wasn't  invited to  that's what I'm  saying I  wasn't invited to  dinner  see I wanted  to go  because I  like Eric  a lot  but I wanted  to go to  the wedding  because it  would be a  hang with  the guys  and all my  friends at  fucking work  I didn't know  that none of  you guys were  going I would  have been  fucking miserable  if I cancelled  this weekend  oh my god  imagine that  me and Troy  would be there  yeah but it's 
[00:34:30]  like you guys  only two guys  from the show  I thought it was  going to be the  whole show  yeah I mean I  don't even think  I think he told  yesterday that there  may be like random  people at our  table it's going to  be Dave Troy  and me with some  seat fillers  it's like they  use it at the  academy awards  they just pop  people in there  I don't want to  be the big  attraction at the  wedding  you would be  you would be  celebrity number  one  he'd be introducing  you to everybody  because he knows  he's a celebrity  Mars' family is  doing the valet  que paso  que paso  aqui  aqui Mars  see me food 
[00:35:00]  senor  por favor  Mars running  and like catching  keys  running out to  the lot  upgrading his car  as it goes along  putting fuzzy  dice in there  catching air as  the superman music  plays like  Ferris Bueller  change missing  from your car  Mars has to tell  you he's not  responsible for  lost or stolen  iPods  Roland I gotta ask  you now since  you declined being  best man  now first you 
[00:35:30]  accepted  over food  yes  now how did  you decline  because that's  an awkward thing  to have to then  tell somebody  especially when  the wedding is  three weeks out  wait when did  you tell him  no  I don't  I mean all  told this  wedding was  planned in  three months  yeah  so it's like  yeah yeah  you know there  wasn't a lot  of time  either way  like he  you know even  if you told  him like a  couple weeks  ago  yeah I try  to remember  it was like  like if he  told me  like if you  go hey  you want to  go eat  kill a dog  and now it's  broken  yeah fuck  yeah 
[00:36:00]  we're gonna  eat  yeah  so how did  you approach  him and tell  him you then  could not  be the best  well it's like  like a well  guess who's  not gonna be  there on your  wedding  he's like  hmm I don't  know who  I'm like  ta-da  and what  what did  you say  and then  he was like  oh  and then it  got awkward  so I just  like going  it's not a  big deal  you're the guy  canceling  but I said  like how long  your marriage  really is gonna  last  oh damn 
[00:36:30]  but he was  getting nervous  cold  fees  I was like  all together  yeah  I'm doing  myself a  favor  yeah  and he  was fine  with this  yeah  backpedal  like a  motherfucker  did you  yeah  did you  was he  mad at  you  a little  yeah  he was  probably  hurt too  I bet  he was  hurt  a little  he thought  Rowan was  gonna be  his big  show business  best friend  it's such an  odd choice  not that you're  an odd choice  but your  relationship's  an odd choice  yes  didn't even  ask Giddles  best man  is someone  you grew up 
[00:37:00]  with  Giddles  is his friend  who's been  around forever  he went on  one of the  homeless shopping  sprees  but we all  love Giddles  Giddles  that is a  fantastic name  everyone's laughing  Giddles  Giddles is exactly  the person you  would think is  Eric's best friend  is he a  guy from the  past  yeah he was  Eric's roommate  like he's Eric's  legit friend  yeah  so is Giddles  now the best  man  but if you  look at Giddles  you say yeah  that's Eric's  best friend 
[00:37:30]  how do we  not know  who Eric's  best friend  I know  who's Giddles  he's very  private  I think he  emailed like  four people  after I said  no  he emailed  like BCC  them  like hey  congratulations  oh a BCC  so people  couldn't tell  that they were  on an email  with three  other people  I didn't  talk about  that Sam  okay  you're right  you imply  things  yes I do  who did he  ask finally  who did he  get  I don't know  we'll find out  mystery best  man tonight  yes  you'll find out  I'm sure  you're gonna  dish all the  dirt  yeah I take  two days off  and I can't 
[00:38:00]  take any  day time off  so  yeah  yeah  why do you have  to take two  days off  he only took  one day  yeah yeah  the time off  now also  Eric Nagel  got a wedding  he got a  because he's a  skinflint  Eric's cheap  yeah  well  it seems so  because  he got  a Friday  wedding  last minute  kind of a  thing  because weddings  are usually  planned  especially if 
[00:38:30]  you're  there's a  burden here  I can hear  yes  especially if  you were  you know  you've been  engaged  for a while  and been with  the same  couple years  three years  you would think  they got engaged  the same weekend  that Obie got  engaged  yes and Obie  has a six month  old and he's  been married  forever  we celebrated  an anniversary  yeah  we were talking  about this  before the show  a little bit  we were saying  how Fan  everybody remembers  Fan right  when Fan  decided that it  was time for him  to get married  he knew Eric 
[00:39:00]  had wanted  to get married  too so he kept  they kept  Fan kept going  when are you  going to schedule  your wedding date  because I don't  want to interfere  with your wedding  oh god  I had short hair  at Fan's wedding  yeah they've been  married for about  two years  oh my  Fan wait  tall guy  looks like a  praying mantis  I remember him  is he invited  to the Nagel  wedding  oh hell no  of course not  wait is she  is there a reason  for this wedding  being so fast  he keeps saying  oh speculate  it's more secretism 
[00:39:30]  but he keeps saying  I just wanted to  get it over with  and he said  he got a good  somebody approached  him with a good  deal on the hall  and everything  well it's Friday  it's 7 o'clock  at night  and it's Friday  7 at night  in Jersey  which by the way  would have been  a fucking nightmare  for anybody  could you imagine  driving to Hobo  you'd have to  take a train  you'd have to  take a train  but you have to  get cabs  that are like  80 bucks  those gypsy cabs  over there  gypsy cabs  I don't know  they don't speak English  they kill you  you get killed 
[00:40:00]  that would have been  a nightmare  I actually have to  do Eric's work  today since he's  not here  and then try to  get out of here  early so I can  get home  put a god damn  suit on  and then drive to Jersey  why didn't you  bring a suit with you  just change your  I've just met you here  or go see Harry Potter  and if you have to  do Eric's work  and get out early  that should be a problem  you're right  I don't even know  what he does  you should start now  yeah you can actually  leave now  you have to go on  Twitter and eat  Subway  and Troy's got to  come over to my place  because he can't get  to Jersey from here 
[00:40:30]  no huh  why  because he'd have to  get two subways  to a train  to a cab  how far is this  from the train  it's Hoboken  small  it's like 15 minutes  up or 20 minutes  up from the train  station  really  it's not a  convenient place  it was like  it was like  when Liza Minnelli  went to Arthur's  party  two months  in a cab  later  and a cab  and a train  and I'll be here  shut up  that ugly monster  oh god  you look at all  the space  you're like  yeah  because nobody  wants to come here  oh god 
[00:41:00]  nobody wants to  come here  so far out  that was  Hoboken  Sam wrote  down a piece  of paper  oh yeah  is it more  Hoboken  or is it more  Jersey City  I think  more to the  there yeah  oh wow  Camden  why would he do it  on a Friday night  the week before  Thanksgiving  it's cheap  it's much less  expensive  it's cheap  but like we said  he's got some cake  you know  oh yeah  and a lot of it  he eats it  and his bride 
[00:41:30]  and his bride to be  is doing very well  too  yeah  well I don't want  to say anything  well she's a wonderful  person  the wonderful  future Mrs. Nagel  that's why we're all  so confused by it  we just want to give  our condolences  to her  it's condolences  that should be given  everybody  does anybody have  any objections  80 people are going  to stand up  what are you doing  including Eric's  whole family  her parents  no loyalty  the new best man  whoever he is  yeah who is  his new best man  who is it  did he ask Howard 
[00:42:00]  Artie Lang  who's doing it  I think Gary  you're in the book signing  he's got Pat Cooper  doing it  who told you that  he's a good man  to marry  he has no idea  who he is  I'm the best man  I'm the best man  I have dignity  dignity  yeah poor Iraq  alright  well that's the  Iraq's nuptials  wow  you'll be going  I believe he is  planning on going  yeah he's planning 
[00:42:30]  on going  to the nuptials  but I'm sure  our own Sam Roberts  will have  full accounting  because you  you know how to  keep your eyes open  your ears open  you don't drink a lot  right  so you know  we'll ask  we'll ask Troy  and he'll go  I don't fucking know  I'll have to give you  all the Troy stories  because he won't have  a fucking clue  what happened  he'll just be like  and then he took  the wedding  I was drinking  so you don't know  what he's talking about  Sam's like a mongoose  he just kind of shows up  peeks  gets all the information  sneaks out 
[00:43:00]  yeah it's creepy  yeah I can't wait  to hear all the details  of the Nagel wedding  I can't wait for it  the Nagel  and then Jess was like  she's talking about  what time we have to leave  because she was like  well we can't be late  to the wedding  the ceremony  and I'm like why  all the action's  going to take place  at the reception  ceremony blows  yeah  I went to  Ope's ceremony  I don't know if I've been  to one since then  I hate the ceremony  you only go with  really close friends 
[00:43:30]  yeah I haven't  been to a wedding  ceremony  they fucking stink  I've  the more weddings  I go to  the less ceremonies  I go to  I just start going  to the reception  yeah  here's the money  take this  yeah  and they will  never know  that you weren't there  fuck  and now a letter  the letter  from John  to the Corinthians  is read by someone  that can't fucking read  it's totally someone 
[00:44:00]  stumbling through  their shit  and now they're reading  the bride and groom  have decided to  make their own vows  I vow  to  lock the refrigerator  at night  and um  I vow  to  I don't know  what do I vow to do  get my stomach stapled  do you promise  to not take  fridgy door rides  because piggy broke 
[00:44:30]  fridgy door  by riding on it  yeah  his refrigerator  door fell off  once didn't it  he just went to  open it  and it fell off  that's saying a lot  he would just  open it  and ride it  closed  and open it again  NASA checked  the hinges  and they just  had stress cracks  on them  yeah there was  an O-ring problem  with Eric's  refrigerator door  poor fat kid  is not even here  the O-ring  is his mouth  too much food  going into it  yeah  there was a  gimbal lock  in the kitchen  exploded  but the good news 
[00:45:00]  is that Jess  until yesterday  was not aware  of the one year  to give a gift  rule  oh really  so I'm going to  see if I can  sell her on that  to at least get  like a momentary  reprieve from  giving anything  because Troy's  got the right idea  there's no reason  I already  sent a gift  yeah he told us  that you did  oh you did  yes he said  it was a very  nice gift  and we tried  to say  Troy actually 
[00:45:30]  brought this up  it was genius  of him  he said  why don't you  kind of make  it like a show  gift  like to see  if that could  be  I was trying  to piggyback  sorry dude  see if that  could be  from the show  damn  we should all  sign a shirt  for him  that would  actually be  his favorite  gift  he would  put it up  I should have  got him a nice  something like that  Eric's good to me  he gets me  stuff signed  that's how we  judge our  friendships on  this show  who gets my  picture signed  it really is a  shallow place  me and Eric  actually had a  moment though  the other day  yeah he came up 
[00:46:00]  and he had  like the serious  Iraq face on  and he shook  my hand  and he was like  I just want to  thank you for  and he always  tries to get it  when you're alone  yeah  you know  like no one  else is in  the studio  he wants to have  a real sincere  moment  so it's like  I just want to  you know  thank you for  the gift  and I hope  before the smile  and no problem  he didn't see  the utter horror  in my face  that I had no  fucking idea  what Ange  had bought  for him 
[00:46:30]  I'll tell you  this  I'll tell you  this  I think that  I think he was  tipped off to that  because he said  he said  yeah Ange sent  me a really nice  gift  he told us  it was like  a wine refrigerator  or something  and then he said  of course the  packing slip  said  Angela Mareska  on it  but  oh damn  oh  tripped up  so  but you got  Iraq a wedding  gift  well  Ange  oops 
[00:47:00]  hey  some things  get lost  in the mail  what are you  gonna do  I gotta give her  something now  though  I might have  a toasty  sandwich  postal service  is not reliable  these days  no  no  it's not  are you wearing  a suit  Roland  he's not going  oh you're not  going at all  no  he said he wasn't  the best man  because he couldn't  go  oh  he's not going  at all  no  I'll be with  a wizard hat  what  what are you doing  what  I don't even know  what that means  Harry Potter  oh you're going  to see Harry Potter 
[00:47:30]  no  he's not  Roland  Roland  didn't want to be  best man  at the wedding  to go see  Harry Potter  it's the best thing  I've ever heard  in my life  oh that's  fantastic  wow  we get a suggestion  coming in  Sam  should re-gift  the Nageltron  gotcha TV  yeah  that's a great idea  that is a good one  he would feel the weight  of it and be all psyched  because he'd think  it was a box of candy  and now I also hear tell 
[00:48:00]  a little more gossip  going on  that Eric is off  until December  that's right  December 1  he's decided to just  yesterday was his last day  yesterday's last day  he's coming back  in December  because I guess  they're taking a honeymoon  that's right  which is good  the Nagels will be spending  the next two weeks  that's what I want to know  where  it's got to be somewhere  nice 
[00:48:30]  nice and sunny  I would think  I'm going to guess  Atlantis  Bahamas  I'll tell you  you would be closer  if you had said  Atlantic City  because  the Nagels  will be spending  two full weeks  or maybe more  at this point  in lovely  Hoboken  slash Jersey City  at the Nagel residence  they're not going away  I asked him  he said he was just  sitting home  playing Red Dead Redemption

[00:55:00]  look at each other and go  your turn  plate spinners  and fucking sword swallers  what do we need  cock swallers  of course  that joke's gotta come up  um  let me uh  let me go here  okay  here's my email  first  Zach  Levi  oh no  Levy  whatever it is  this is to  Levi  this is to Travis  by the way  who is the um  producer of the program  I go right to the top  Zach 
[00:55:30]  Levi  Levi  thank you  I never got an email  about Zach  uh  two question marks  after his name  two question marks  which really means a  talking  that is true  the boss is speaking  talk  talking  um  and then I kind of  beat around the bush  a little at the beginning  who the fuck is he  oh no  and did we ever agree  to have him in  Roland is getting a bit  rambunctious  that was my 
[00:56:00]  that was my  um  that was mine  whoa  um  and then  I get  uh  from  the lovely  Travis  my pal  we can just stop there  we don't have to  yeah you both said yes  to him  he's the  lead in Chuck  I don't give a fuck  if you want to cancel  oh  that goes  for Nealon as well  just let me know  why you don't like  Kevin Nealon  I don't have a problem 
[00:56:30]  with him but if you guys  change your mind  you know you change your mind  he's just being uh  accommodating  as a producer  let me know  if you want him  if you love him  you can have him  if you don't  you don't give a fuck  he's neutral  like a good executive  producer should be  now I  as one  former  said  absolutely  do not remember  this Zachary guy  being pitched  it was uh  please  set the mood  set the  you told me  it was uh  with uh  Jim Sturges  and Zach Levi  I printed out  I said these two  I need a favor from 
[00:57:00]  but I thought  the favor guy  was Jim Sturges  right  no I said  those two  which one was  he  he was the guy  who came in  the British guy  who was fine  alright  what about  the other  favorite guy  that I thought  that was the  global warming  I said  that wasn't  the favorite guy  I said  would you guys  like him  also  oh no  I said  these two  are the favors  you're a  verbal shell  game  with these  guests  he's fucking  doing three  three guest  Monty  that's what he  does  hey  where's the 
[00:57:30]  guest you  want  this guy  oh shit  I got a  Zachary  Levy  I'll give you  two Zach  Levy's  for one  Sturgis  alright  oh here it  is  alright  and as we  look in  the middle  there's  President Bush  he's got a  book tour  going  and we go  back and  forth  where's  President Bush  where is he  is he on  the right  oh it's  Zachary  Levy  the guy  from Chuck  Levi  Levi  like the  pants  that's right  I'll remember  it that way  like the  pants  like the  pants  a Disney 
[00:58:00]  movie  well that  falls right  into our  demo  it does  because  Tron is  coming out  on Disney  who we  will get  no one  from  I don't  think the  favorite  things have  ever worked  never  who have  we taken  who  did we  take  in order  to get  Jeff  Bridges  Zachary  Levi  oh wait  wait  you're  saying  we're  going to  get  Jeff  Bridges  ok  hold  the phone  should I  mark  the sound  yes please  mark it  mark the  time 
[00:58:30]  mark the  date  mark everything  so we can  play that  clip  when it  never  happens  how about  this  loser leaves  town  if we don't  get Jeff  Bridges  rolling  quits  holy shit  loser leaves  you gotta  buff my  ass  I'm not  saying  now Roland  this is  nothing  against you  you're  doing what  is called  your job  right  and I  understand  this  but  I'm  seeing  like  these  guests  that I  don't  really  like  I don't 
[00:59:00]  think  now if  it's a  favor  it's a  favor  I'm  willing  to do  a favor  and someday  and this  day may  never  come  you will  be asked  to do  a favor  for us  and you  will get  the favor  automatically  no matter  what  call Roland  but they've  never  you come  through  but they  don't  the studios  never  come through  you hold  up your  side of  the bargain  you do  the favor  the guest  comes in  and then  big movies  come around  and we  never see  these people  never  Edward Norton  finally came  in 
[00:59:30]  I'm happy  I was there  not here of  course but  we never  get them  they never  say yes  they're publicists  and that was  years in the  making by the  way  absolutely  if we hadn't  done 18  phoners with  them we  never would  have gotten  Edward  Norton  and their  publicists  always say  no  like the  next time  next time  like Gervais  we only got  one time  because he's  now I  talked to his  people he's  coming back  next year  2011  because somebody  who  you need to  call your  people  somebody  before I  came here  called these 
[01:00:00]  people  and pissed  them off  it said  the wrong  thing  yeah because  Roland wasn't  here to  Roland's credit  and I heard  things through  the grapevine  the person  who's not  here anymore  trying to  pitch it  the wrong  way  and then  yell at  these people  someone yelled  at this person  saying well  if you don't  want them  fuck you  guys  blah blah  blah  and that  hurts the  publicist  I know  I'm just  saying  no we  didn't  oh what's 
[01:00:30]  that  no we  didn't  I don't  believe you  let me just  say that  no we  did not  we absolutely  did not  when  in studio  yes  no we  wouldn't  yes  I would  have said  yes  in a second  the person  who was  before me  told  when  it was  the year  I wasn't  here in  november  how long ago  maybe about  six months  ago  the audience 
[01:01:00]  knows we  love  Gervais  that would  never have  happened  I got a  phone call  from the  publicist  that day  oh no  no no  no  alright  that's  something  different  Jesus  fuck  oh my  god  so but  I cleaned  up all  the mess  is all  clean  everything  back to  normal  and after  Zachary  Levi  I promise  you  no more  favorites  from me  I promise  you that  I'll mark  that down  too  yeah yeah  could you  mark that  one down  mark the  time  date 
[01:01:30]  timestamp  this tape  was that  an in studio  or a phone  or a phone  I'm not sure  if it was in  studio  I think it was  a phone  I vaguely  remember that  I had a phone  call after  because I wasn't  with the guys  and I told them  I'm not with  the guys anymore  because I vaguely  remember that  incident  I think it was  pitched as a  phone  I believe so  too  I don't think  we would have  ever said no  I know  I never  would have  said no  I think  that was  pitched as a  phone  every appearance  by him  has been  brilliant  and there's 
[01:02:00]  no way  you guys  have to  read more  everything's  fixed  everything's  clear  and all I  ask is  Zachary Levi  quick 10 minutes  and I will not  ask for anything  and he might be  good because  Jim Sturridge  just turned out  to be a cool  dude  and Chuck  is a big  show  it's been  four seasons  he's doing  Conan next  week  if I don't  watch it  it's not  good  that's my  litmus test  why don't we  take a break  because I have  lovely food 
[01:02:30]  here  I have  eggy wigs  everything looks  so delicious  and when we  get back  I want to hear  this thing  it's the  situation I guess  and Bristol Palin  did a safe  sex PSA  and from  what I hear  the situation  is trying  to act  like the  situation  and doing  a horrid  job  like when  sports stars  are on  sitcoms  and they  can't play 
[01:03:00]  themselves  they're so  stiff  that's what  I'm grasping  do you think  they're bad  sports stars  in sitcoms  it is the  worst idea  do they still  do it  at all  not that  often  no  it's been  the only  ones I  ever saw  that were  almost a  little good  was on  Seinfeld  and they  were almost  like I think  Keith Hernandez  did a great  job as  Keith Hernandez  there's a whole  generation of  people that  just know  Keith Hernandez  because he  was on  Seinfeld  and I  thought maybe  he acted  as a 
[01:03:30]  player  you know  that was  it  and then  when George  was teaching  batting practice  I thought that  was funny  too  they drove  Danny Tardable  to the  yeah  that was  another one  it just  like to get  Yankee  that was  kind of  cool  but for the  most part  especially back  in the 70s  and the Brady  bunch  and things  like when  they just  figured they'd  boost ratings  by having the  star du jour  the sports  Joe Namath walk  on  yeah yeah  Muhammad Ali  walked into the  Drummond house  on different strokes 
[01:04:00]  did he really  yes he did  he thought Arnold  was one of his  turds  literally  walked into it  he didn't open  the door  he just walked  into the building  see because  he's shaky  Kimberly was  trying to put  a tie on  so he pulled  it and she  wound up  in the rafters  you know  because she  hung herself  I think  no I think  it was a  drug overdose  oh good  then that joke  didn't work  for many reasons  whatever  but yeah  I gotta see  if the situation  really pulls  this one off  he wants to be  a serious actor  so I bet he  does well  yeah  what else 
[01:04:30]  do we got there  that JetBlue  attendant  Stephen Slater  he's a rap  song  oh yeah  he has a rap  song  yeah I know rap  and this is a rap  song  oh god  what is it about  like that  well he's advertising  an iPhone app  his own  no  a company hired him  to do a rap song  why would they hire him  because he's  he's pop culture  man  pop culture is pop culture  for 10 minutes  these days  he's completely  uninteresting to everybody  yeah  he has to pay for the door  he's a douche bag  did he have to pay for the door 
[01:05:00]  yes  that's fantastic  should we take a break then  yeah let's take a break  we'll be right back  BRB  these words  Sirius XM  the virus  this is the OB Anthony Show  the OB and Anthony Show  a funk  funk  hi everybody  OB and Anthony Show  Friday edition  I like that edition 
[01:05:30]  that means  I can slack off  all night  tomorrow  tomorrow night  Sunday  Sunday  and then you gotta  start thinking about  being good boy  I was a good boy  last night  because I knew  if I went to stretch  two days off  wow  hell to pay  hell to pay  I thought  yesterday  I was just like 
[01:06:00]  you know what  why not  just why not  why not  I just didn't even have  an excuse or anything  I was just like  you know what  I'm gonna take a  personal day  god damn it  personal day  since we signed our deal  what's the matter  Jimmy  what's the matter  my headphones are broken  your little earpiece  came off  I'm trying to talk  but I can't  get it on there  it goes on like a condom  ask someone how that works  exactly  I usually just fuck 
[01:06:30]  and then go  you look pretty healthy  yeah  it's great  I don't want to use  guest headphones  oh ew  maggots in there  or whatever it is  bed bugs  bed bug ears  Jesus Christ  what's the matter  with this  can Mars fix this  please  yeah I was a  I was a good boy  last night  because  you know  I took  I took yesterday  off as a  personal day 
[01:07:00]  all the speculation  god  they do speculate  OB takes the day  you know  and then he's got to  take the rest of the week  and then  I'm like  you know  fuck  hopes out  I figure what the hell  good opportunity  to take a little  personal day  which entailed  talking to  my  accountant  one of those  you know how many  of these job reality  shows are out there  now  they got the  auctioneer 
[01:07:30]  site guy  and they got  pickers  and then they got  the  the  some of them  other job  shows  they got  dirty jobs  dirty jobs  pawn stars  pawn stars  auction kings  auction kings  they got a lot  of those things  the ice road  truckers  billy the exterminator  billy the exterminator  oh he stinks  cake boss  ace of cakes 
[01:08:00]  ace of cakes  pit boss  pit boss  undercover ball  undercover ball  let's just  suffice to say  there's a lot  of these  shows  on  you will  never see  accountant wars  it is the  dullest  job  so I had  to talk to him  yesterday  is he boring  it's just  like he's  he's a nice  enough guy  but  but it's just 
[01:08:30]  talking about  finances  and and  everything  involves so  much  paperwork  and signatures  and things  and things  that you have  to like  get  that have  been filed  away for a  while  and you gotta  find things  and me  with finding  things  no  no  it's just  a pain  so I did  that  I sacrificed  my day  off to do  that  played a little  black ops  which is fun  and then 
[01:09:00]  I got  no I'm not  being audited  as long as  I at least  let me knock  wood on that  one  and then  I got  hung up  I got  great gaming  systems  you know  xbox  I got  black ops  I got  red dead  redemption  all the fun  games  and I sat  there for  what had  to be  six hours  playing  angry birds  on my  fucking  ipad  it's  it's one 
[01:09:30]  of the most  addicting  stupid ass  games  I never  got it  you ever  play it  no  you take  these various  birds  sounds horrible  it's  it's horrible  it's awful  but I can't  stop playing it  it's by far  the best selling  game  in iphone  it's the number  one game  angry bird  ever on the  iphone  ok  there's  these little  piggies  I like to  call them  nagles  they're all  over the  board  and they're  in various  structures 
[01:10:00]  little rickety  wooden structures  and little  concrete things  and they're  all there  and they  laugh at  you  they're  they make  little sounds  that annoy  you  and then  you get  a slingshot  off to the  left of  this structure  and you  put the  little bird  in there  and you  gotta shoot  the bird  at the  structure  or at the  piggies  to kill  all the  piggies  with the  limited amount  of birds  that you have  and certain  birds do  certain things  some just  some just  fucking  fling 
[01:10:30]  with the  slingshot  they don't  do shit  other ones  hit  and then you  hit the  screen again  and they  explode  other ones  multiply  multiply  like you  hit it  and then it  breaks into  three  sometimes if you  slide the  screen up  the yellow  birds  the velocity  goes very  fast  they go  very fast  like you  get them  on target  and then you  slide  and the  thing  goes fast  and then that  boomerang  bird  which I had  such a hard  time with  again I kept  boomeranging him  into midair and  he just missed  my target  completely  but I did 
[01:11:00]  this to the  point where  my eyes  I felt like I  was arc welding  for five hours  without a fucking  shield on my  face  it was  burning  eyes burning  you could have  done anything  else in that  time and it  would have been  more valuable  anything  well I was  I was poking  the fire  which I do  in the fireplace  and drinking  because that's  what I do  how long did  you play  for  it had  to be  from the  time the  accountant  left which  was probably  three in the 
[01:11:30]  afternoon  until  eleven thirty  at night  what  yes  angry birds  angry stupid  fuckbirds  did you eat  dinner  I quickly  made myself  a turkey  sandwich  and then ran  back to get  to the angry  birds  ran back  what the  fuck  and the whole  time  I was making  the sandwich  I just was  hearing  they're laughing  at me  they make  sounds at  you  I can't  comprehend  ever wanting  to play 
[01:12:00]  angry birds  if you  played it  you would  keep playing  it  it's only  like a  dollar  you can't  I looked  at it  a thousand  times  and said  why is this  the number  one game  I would  never  fucking  play  this  that's  how they  get you  I played  it  and it  was over  Johnny  I do  chess puzzles  and I do  a couple  of them  while I  shit  are there  birds  in it  yes  there are  angry  and they  pick up  my bishop  and move  it  I know  you play  chess  I see  that  I see  that a lot  but I can't 
[01:12:30]  I'm not  good at it  I'm very  average  but at least  I understand  why I like  that  angry birds  I can't  comprehend  but now  here's  the only  thing I'll  give to  angry birds  there is  a strategy  thing involved  you do  realize  you have  delete it  and have  fun  that's  the strategy  get blown  you have  a limited  amount  of birds  sure  as life  would be  and a lot  of times  you're like  there's no  way  I can  bring down 
[01:13:00]  this structure  and kill  all these  little piggies  with only  this limited  amount  of birds  and you  really gotta  start thinking  like  I'll launch  it over  and have it  come drop  straight down  so that  knocks into  that  you gotta  start thinking  about the  structure  itself  and there  is a strategy  to it  it's not  just flinging  birds at  the little  piggy structures  there's actually  YouTube  walkthroughs  of like  every level  you can't  look at it  if you  use a  YouTube  walkthrough 
[01:13:30]  shoot yourself  in the head  uh oh  you're being  pointed at  by Travis  he's ratting  you out  right now  did you use  a YouTube  walkthrough  to get  through  angry birds  absolutely  not  I found  out about  it  because I  posted  on Twitter  I can't  get past  this level  and then  everybody  started  Twittering  me  go to  YouTube  YouTube  YouTube  but I  didn't  go through  it  I don't  know  why would  you think  I can't  get past  the bird  level  I don't  I don't  get it  I did  spend  an hour  and a half  trying to  get past  one  fucking  structure  fucking  blows  angry birds 
[01:14:00]  blows  and I was  starting to  yell  and I was  starting to  text people  that I was  very angry  more angry  than the birds  I was very  angry  um  Danny  line two  please  let's go to  Justin  I can't  hear  but I'm  actually going  to take a  call  oh Jimmy  doesn't have  headphones  hey Justin  Jimmy  um  yeah what's  up  I beat  angry birds  the other  day  and I felt  a real sense  of loss  that there  wasn't another  structure or  level  to beat 
[01:14:30]  and now  I've got  I've got to  go back  through the  game  and get  three stars  on everything  and that's  a real  pain in the  ass  well get  yeah getting  you gotta be  good to get  three stars  in each one  you gotta  take them  down  have a couple  birds left  over  yeah a couple  of birds  left over  but uh  sir have  you played  the Halloween  uh portion  there's another  download  he uh  he left  we could hang  up on him  there's a  I guess a  Halloween  version  yes that's  true I  haven't downloaded  which is some  new levels 
[01:15:00]  and stuff like  that  what's the  new Halloween  version  I don't  care  but no  actually do  they add  birds or  is it like  I don't  care  it's addicting  it really is  addicting  it just gets  addicting  because you  could sit  there you  could do  anything  you could  fucking  poke the  fire and  drink  you could  watch a  TV show  you could  do anything  and you  just  you're just 
[01:15:30]  shooting birds  at things  does it  really make  that noise  yeah  I don't  care  Jimmy really  doesn't care  about this  angry birds  no but I've  seen it so  many times  and uh  I just  don't  understand  it's always  the number  one thing  if you ever  tried it  you'd probably  just keep  playing it  I don't  know  sometimes I  try to  play when  I'm the  passenger  in a car  but that's  a terrible  time to play  because your  finger gets  shaky  oh passenger  in a car  no no  you'll puke  yes  I can't do  anything as 
[01:16:00]  a passenger  in a car  except look  out the  fucking  windshield  my girlfriend  read a book  all the way to  Atlantic City  in the back  I'm like how  the fuck  do you do  that  maybe vomiting  not because she  can't read  oh okay  how do you  do that  without getting  sick  yeah  if you  look down  too much  if you're  on your  iPhone  and reading  you just  and then all  of a sudden  you'll get  this whoosh  this whoosh  of queasiness  comes over  you and you're  like what  the fuck  I can't even  look at my  phone  then you gotta 
[01:16:30]  roll the window  down and look  out the  windshield  just look at  what the  driver's doing  but then driving  oh man  you can read  you can do  anything  I get nauseous  sometimes  in the back  of the cab  so I get  very sick  yeah depending  on how  they're driving  yeah synomial  fluid  builds up  behind the  ear  and it  tells you  your body  thinks you're  doing one  thing  but your  mind thinks  you're doing  another  so it's a  reaction  the cochlea  the cochlea  in the ear  is what's  kind of  causing that  it's your  body convincing 
[01:17:00]  yourself  that you're  fucked up  it is some  kind of a  motion sickness  thing  what gives  you that  I think it  is that  fluid in  your ear  and your  eyes  aren't  working in  conjunction  with each  other  and that  makes you  nauseous  why would  that happen  why would  they put  that stupid  thing in  a body  I forget  what  your body  interprets it  as something  else  like you're  going crazy  or you're  having an  optical illusion  so why  throw up  it's like  well let's  make him  throw up  do they  think you've  been poisoned 
[01:17:30]  maybe your  body thinks  you've been  poisoned  because you're  all fucked  up  how about  a body  cuts the  shit  I know  kind of  figure it  out  look into  the brain  let the brain  tell you  no you're  driving  dummy  hate that  hate feeling  queasy  oh it's  horrible  I really  wish that  Dr. Steve  or someone  I never  thought I'd say  this  I wish Dr. Steve  would call  oh god  please  because I want  to know  see the driving  while reading  or drinking  one little  ounce of his  wine  makes you feel  the same way  projectile  vomit  get it  his wine 
[01:18:00]  stinks  is it not  good  uh oh  what happened  I just broke  the headphone  but it was  an accident  oh the little  headphone jack  bent  I hope  it snaps  I hope  it snaps  off  you got  a little  eighth inch  jack  and it's  bent now  he's putting  it in his  little headphone  hole  how's it  how's it  going  good  yes  put in a  hole  it wasn't  going  good  who's this  I don't know  someone coming  down the hall  with a suitcase  I've had enough  of our fucking  1970s intern  I know  oh Manson  yeah 
[01:18:30]  what do you  call him  Manson  I started  calling him  Charles Manson  today  yeah  it's more  more like  fog hat  it looks like  to me  just a very  young  Charles Manson  the singer  from  oh the cool  one that used  to write songs  before he realized  I have his tape  do you  Manson's music  really  I have  traded with  e-rock  for a fucking  80s top 40  show  no I have  Charles Manson's  I don't know  what I have  with me  but I have  his fucking  CD  is it any  good  no  is he rocking  he blows  what's he 
[01:19:00]  singing about  I don't know  nothing fun  sing happy  sunshiny songs  that'd be great  I like  Folger's coffee  but I can't  stand the  bitch  yeah he  fancied  himself quite  the song  smith  in his  younger years  and actually  I think some  people were  interested  from certain  books I read  they were  interested in  kind of his  wacky little  loose  lifestyle 
[01:19:30]  thing  I got some  Charles Manson  songs  you want to  hear one  oh you got  them  yeah I got  a few  he worked  at the  beach boys  which one  you got  yes  don't do  anything  illegal  I got  that one  what year  is that  from  95  garbage dump  I love  garbage dump  that was one  of my favorites  he's just  singing about  a garbage  dump  that's  great  it's a  place to  throw all  your  garbage  yeah let's  hear a little  Manson  Sharon Tate's  womb  don't do  anything  oh god 
[01:20:00]  that's just  awful  unnecessary  and completely  the show  okay  I got a little  change in my  pocket  gonna pay  text  to kill  people  another one  it's only  coming out  a one  oh this  sounds like  one of those  shredding  videos on  youtube  anything  illegal  beware of  the eagle  that's right  in the middle  of your back  it's like  it's almost 
[01:20:30]  it's almost like  an Arlo  Guthrie  and the  doors  they got  you  in a  sack  wow  very nice  and they keep  you looking  bad  don't do  anything  illegal  anywhere  of the eagle  that's got you  this is the  most ironic  song I've  ever heard  anyone sing  don't do  anything  illegal  his fucking 
[01:21:00]  vocals are way  too low  what a dick  yeah  doesn't mean  I'm not the  balls to put  it heavy in  the mix  what's wrong  of him  oh listen  to that guitar  he's terrible  at playing  guitar  good at  convincing  people to  kill other  people but  he's way in  the background  yeah  I'm juggling 
[01:21:30]  sound effects  his voice is  actually it's  better than you  think it would  be  he's not good  at recording  songs  it's fucking  awful  he probably had  Tex Watson doing  this with a  bloody knife  how'd your  parents die  how'd your  parents die  that's terrible  I'm sorry  wow  that's terrible  that's terrible  oh okay 
[01:22:00]  this is horrible  thank you  do you have  one more song  maybe one more  example  I think one  example  yeah just one  isn't enough  I don't think  so we're  prejudging this  guy  alright let's  hear one more  little piece  of Charles  or Chuck  Manson  you know how  they call  Charlton Heston  Charlton Heston  but his close  friends  it's Chuck  Heston  oh garbage  dump  oh garbage  dump  I sing this  every day  when I walk  into work  girls don't like 
[01:22:30]  when you sing  this right  before you  go down  on them  you could  feed the  world  with my  garbage  dump  you could  feed the  world  with my  garbage  dump  I dropped  these in the  toilet  good garbage  dump  get it  that sums 
[01:23:00]  up  yeah  when you're  living on  the road  and you think  sometimes you're  starving  and to bring it  all back to the  beginning of the  show this is  E-Roc's  wedding song  yeah  yeah  garbage dump  there's magic on  these tapes man  why are you called  my garbage dump  garbage dump 
[01:23:30]  garbage dump  why are you called  my garbage dump  stop it  he wanted to be like  a fucking  he wanted to be  somebody  the reaction to this 
[01:24:00]  was so bad  he had to kill a  pregnant woman  to wipe the  memories of it away  do you understand  the massacre  he had to  orchestrate  to remove  the memory  of this one  he wanted to be  known as anything  but this so badly  he had to slaughter  a coffee heiress  leave her head  by a grape  holy dip  uh  danny people  are begging  to uh  have this put  on my karaoke  machine  uh  who wouldn't want  to see maybe  sal  raw garbage dump 
[01:24:30]  oh garbage dump  raw garbage dump  I don't know  he's got trouble  with the songs  he knows  oh I know  please  Jesus Christ  garbage  I like the  the big ending  that's fantastic  good job  Charles  garbage dump  oh garbage dump  who's not gonna be  hearing that in their  fucking head  sucked  my garbage dump  without the killing  part like 
[01:25:00]  it seemed like a  pretty cool thing  he had for the  60s you know  they lived on some  old western movie  set  that's like a  cool 60s thing  to do  just fucking  all filthy  hippie chicks  that's cool  he's a very  charismatic guy  in interviews  when you hear  he actually makes  sense when you  hear him  interviewed  he's like  is he really  yeah yeah  he's not a  dumb guy  he's like  I didn't kill  anybody  he's like  they were college  students man  I'm a beatnik  he makes really  good arguments  where you're like  he technically  didn't kill  he probably  if tried in a 
[01:25:30]  court today  for the same  type of crimes  with all the  legal wrangling  they do now  he probably  would have gotten  off the hook  cause yeah  he didn't kill  anybody  he did not kill  anybody  and he said  they were college  educated people  man  you have any  interviews with  Manson or no  yeah  this is a good  documentary  wow  can you just  hear him for a  second  that's crazy  that's the guy  I'm a street  child  I'm a runaway  little girl 
[01:26:00]  at 15 years old  out of Kentucky  named Kathleen  Maddox  I didn't have a  husband  my husband's  name was Scott  and  he  married somebody  else and went  down the road  and she went to  Cincinnati had a  guy named  Charlie Manson  I like how he  talked about  him  born on  November 12  1934  in Cincinnati  Ohio  in Cincinnati  General Hospital  his mother  Kathleen Maddox  was just 16  and unmarried 
[01:26:30]  when he was born  whore  whore mother  born of a whore  mother  wow  she looks like  Nurse Ratched  really does  wow  she looks like  Louise Fletcher  she was as  motherly looking  as my mother  was  Manson  childhood friend  Dolores Longwell  you sure don't want that  she went to prison  for five years  for strong arm  robbery  her brother  had to deal  a trick in  off the street  and put the  yoke on him  to get some  money to eat  put the yoke  on him  she was a prostitute  it just  I couldn't believe 
[01:27:00]  that either  wow  and she went  to prison  and I used to  visit her in the  prison visiting  room  sounds like  George Bush  oh my god  he does  he sounds like  Bush  wow  except he makes  more sense  got it  alright  this is nothing  this is one  you want to watch  it's just good  I just like  the  he sounds like  Bush  alright 
[01:27:30]  you cannot go  to the school  you don't have  to set it  on fire  how do you  get Manson  for an interview  I would love  to interview  Manson  we have to  do a favor  first  we have to  interview  people that  had tickets  people that  had received  some parking  tickets  and then we  work our way  up to Manson  he's like  could you  interview  Joel Rifkin  and then 
[01:28:00]  it's a favor  they want  and then  they'll give you  Manson  you gotta interview  other serial killers  could you interview  there's a guy  who did three  rapes  they just want  you to interview  him first  it's a favor  for the  penal system  they'll get  you Manson  after  I just  want to  kick my  own teeth  out for a  second  because  when the  clip first  started playing  I went  god  Manson's  crazy  really  Anthony  well that's  a good  point  Anthony  he's like  some kind  of a crazy  person  Jesus 
[01:28:30]  Kevin  Nealon  is here  you may  remember  Kevin Nealon  from a little  show called  Saturday Night  Live  I've never met  Kevin  really  never met him  no  have you  played at  some of the  same venues  maybe  he's much  more famous  than I am  so it's  possible  but he's  probably doing  gigs I'm not  doing  I hear  telly's a  tall drink  of water  as they  say  a tall  drink  of water  tall  not big  you know  tall  Sam just 
[01:29:00]  ran down  the hall  what did  you want  to play  did you  want to  play  anything  before  we don't  have  time  oh of  course  I did  but with  Kevin Nealon  coming in  I'm just  in a  I'm in a  quandary  we're in  one of  those like  oh is there  time to  play that  is Kevin  Nealon  walking down  he is  walking down  the hall  what is  it  look he's  got an  entourage  he's got  Troy  and Roland  what a horrible  entourage that is  god Charles  Manson's mother  I cannot believe  how much she  looks like 
[01:29:30]  Nurse  Ranchet  she does look  like Nurse  Ranchet  wow  and probably  just as  sympathetic  to raise  a child  like  he was  already  in prison  when that movie  was made  that's how  when the  godfather  was made  Manson had  done two  years already  yeah  I mean  that's how  long  man that's  something  Kevin Nealon  there he is  and see  he is tall  yes he is  it wasn't  trick photography  or anything  how you doing  sir  Anthony  hi  we bring  people in  on the air 
[01:30:00]  so a lot  of people  are confused  they sit  down  and go  after five  minutes  they go  are we  on the air  it's like  yeah we're  on the air  it's more  entertaining  to bring them  in  what do you  got there  I have  an apple  and a banana  oh very  healthy guy  there  and then  you know  and then  just some  brownies  apple  bananas  brownies  I love to  shove sweets  into my  fat mouth  right now  I'm starving  are you a  sweet guy  yeah I mean  I try not to  be because  my eating habits 
[01:30:30]  are despicable  it's kind of  hard  you know  it is  on the road  it's brutal  you can't eat  healthy anywhere  but New York  or LA  I bought  an apple  and a banana  I'm not going  to eat them  just start to  remind me  this is what  I should be  eating  just have it  Roman homeless  people here  have this  bum  and go buy  cake  you know  when I bought  some food  for a homeless  guy once  because he was  asking for money  were you hungry  he goes yeah  yeah  so I got him  some food  I brought it  back  and he goes  nah I don't  like this  that is one  of the biggest  like insults  I think  in the homeless  community  like we look  at it as  something nice 
[01:31:00]  to do  they look  at it as  like look  you know  I want drugs  and booze  you're just  screwing with me  here giving me  food  I don't want  to eat  yeah I mean  he was really  just insulted  he was  yeah yeah  no I don't want  that  because the sign  always says  like I'm hungry  I haven't eaten  but it's like  look I'm playing  poker here  I'm bluffing  don't call me  yeah you're right  and what about  these guys  that will work  for food  they're not  going to work  and plus  what would you  have them do  yeah exactly  would you bring  them in the house 
[01:31:30]  and have them  clean up  could you just  stand here  and smell  for a few hours  and I'll be  happy to give  you some food  yeah yeah  put your sign  in my truck  there's an old lady  I need bricked  in the side of the head  would you take  care of that  that's probably  good  that's the kind  of stuff  yeah  you'd probably get  a homeless guy  to fucking do  some damage  for you  or maybe get  them to you know  collect on some  of the loans  that people owe you  because they're  going to ask  them for money  but they'd forget  and just  they'd forget  who you asked  to clock on the head  and just find  an old tourist  from Australia  you got to write  it on their  cardboard sign  say you owe me 
[01:32:00]  you owe  Kevin Nealon  50 dollars  well those dummies  would probably  collect 50 grand  and just go  buy Boone's Ferry  what is it called  Boone's Farm  Boone's Farm  Boone's Ferry  I took Boone's Ferry  once  oops wait a minute  it's terrible  I've been sober  too long  I forget  Boone's Farm  Boone's Farm  Strawberry Hill  was like one of  the ones  yeah yeah  what about Ripple  Ripple  Ripple was like  the joke  from Red Fox's 
[01:32:30]  joke  from Sanford and  Son  and I never  thought of  going like to  Ripple  that to me was  wow you're at  the bottom of the  barrel  but if you got  like Boone's Farm  Strawberry Hill  a little Martini  and Rossi  Osti Spumante  around the holidays  and got together  with some of your  friends  underage friends  and chugged that  stuff down  until you vomited  you were having  a great night  that was friendship  you still tell the  stories you know  to your friends  wine always made me  horribly sick  do you drink  I used to 
[01:33:00]  not heavily  but I mean  I used to like to  get I figured  you know  why drink  unless you're  going to get  drunk  I mean  why not  I mean  that's the  reason I drank  I drink for  the taste  says the guy  with the  you know  the scotch  that's warm  yeah  in the bottom  of the glass  they pour out  that quarter  inch  18 times  by the time  you know it  you're pretty  hammered  this codependent  wife's in the  corner with a  black eye  and a sling  on her shoulder  here's the thing  for me  I couldn't drink  when I was  you know 
[01:33:30]  until I was  like 21  but the drinking  age was 18  in New York  so I grew up  in Connecticut  a lot of guys  would take the  train in  to the stumble  in  right in  Portchester  it was the  name of the  place  but I looked  like I was  12  until I was  about 30  so even if  I had a fake  ID  they wouldn't  believe it  hard to get  booze  yeah  growing up  it was  kind of easy  somebody was  always able  to get  something  and we  never hung  out in bars  it was always  the woods  I grew up  out on Long  Island  very suburban  so we just 
[01:34:00]  went out in  the woods  and drank  like Jack  Daniels  did you sniff  glue  vomited  no we're  never into  I knew  guys that  were into  like just  that  they'll do  anything  to get  high  I was such  a little  pussy  I wouldn't  you know  which I  guess was  good  but I  wouldn't  huff the  paint  or sniff  glue  we sniffed  I guess  it's what  they do  now  and people  it's almost  like anal  nitrate  you'd open  like a little  jar of it  and you'd hold  it and your  whole head would  go like  you did that  oh my god  when I was a 
[01:34:30]  teenager  it gave you  a very bad  headache  after a while  that's a  guy who  that's what  guys do  when they  blow each  other in  boots  I heard  they do  you'll hear  that  if you ever  watch it  in a porno  movie  you hear  somebody  getting blown  how does  that enhance  the situation  I have no  idea  I can't do  it  but I don't  know  I guess  doing that  makes you  kind of  forget  you have  a headache  god I'm  blowing a  man  this is  terrible  but it must  be good  for sex  but you  can't get  a lot  of that  stuff  now  over the  counter 
[01:35:00]  you know  they keep  all that  stuff  away  you can  still  drink  cologne  though  right  people  kids  are  drinking  last I  heard  doing that  was  kitty  dukakis  many years  ago  did she  really  cologne  and hair  spray  at least  if you  have a hangover  you throw up  it smells  good  awful smell  coming out  of the toilet  I knew  people who  were sober  who said  they used  to drink  fucking  sterno  the thing  that you  burn  you can  drink  anything  to get  fucked  up  that would  make  you blind  though  I'm  sure  it's  not  good  you're  probably  not  in a  rational  place  when you  do  it  no 
[01:35:30]  that's  that's  it  Danny  it's  called  Rush  exactly  and now  some of  these drinks  now  with the  caffeine  in it  they're  starting  to ban  the alcohol  and the  caffeine  I don't  know  why  are they  banning  that  because  it's  New York  State  I guess  right now  is  taking  the  caffeinated  alcohol  beverages  off  because  it's  like  it's  the  poor  man's  speed  ball  it's  a  hell  of  lot  caffeine  and some  booze  you drink  it  why are  they taking  that away  they're  saying  the FDA  is saying  that it's  an unapproved  food additive  caffeine  it's okay 
[01:36:00]  to have  the alcohol  you know  the alcoholic  beverage  but it's  unsafe  to  then  I guess  what they're  saying  is  it keeps  you awake  too long  to drink  more  you can't  drive  well put it  this way  it's  it's  like an  energy drink  like a  red bull  it's full  of caffeine  and taurine  and all that  stuff  and it's  a 12%  alcohol  by volume  drink  so what  that really  means  and it  tastes  like shitty  kool-aid  like alcoholic  kool-aid  so a  college could  down one  of these  things  in 10  15 minutes 
[01:36:30]  and it's  like the  equivalent  of drinking  five beers  and they'll  have like  two or  three at  a time  so they  don't even  realize  that they're  so it's  for the  college kids  mostly  so it's  got to be  eliminated  from new  york state  completely  because of  the college  kids  who by the  way will  drink  anyway  and who  get prescribed  adderall  like it's  like it's  finstone's  chewables  xanax  vodka  and red bull  that's it  that makes  a nice cocktail  by the way  you gotta  know how to  make it  my mom makes  it  oh  do you ever  drink like  at a high 
[01:37:00]  altitude  not in a  plane  only in a  plane  and if it  never lost  cabin pressure  so i didn't  know the  feeling  what do you  mean like  actually climbing  a mountain  like if you're  in lake tahoe  or somewhere  you know  or aspen  oh i did  drink in  yeah in  aspen and  denver  i mean it  really it  really you  know speeds  up things  yeah yeah  you get really  drunk fast  and i didn't  like this also  because i was  in one of  those uh  a condo  thing  in aspen  and 10 
[01:37:30]  stairs to  get up  stairs and  i was like  shot like i  actually thought i  had to go to  the hospital  something was  wrong i  instantly got  like leukemia  or something  but i had  no energy  whatsoever  i lived in  lake tahoe  for a while  i had a  condo up  there and  it's 89  stairs to  get up to  the condo  oh my god  and when you  first get there  you're not  used to the  altitude and  you're bringing  suitcases up  you gotta i  had to stop  like every other  stair you  it's the  worst and  you you  initially you  don't think  about it so 
[01:38:00]  you grab it  and go at  the normal  speed you  would at  regular  normal  person  beer on  the way up  the stairs  beer smoking  whatever you  want to do  and then you  realize eight  steps later you're  falling down  who are you living  next door to  tom hagan  why would you  take late  tall  tom hagan  tom yeah it's  uh yeah and  you do get  really wasted  very and you  know they charge  you like ten  dollars a drink  there and at  first you go  ten dollars a  drink and they  go oh okay but  this one will have  the effect of  three drinks  yeah so you don't 
[01:38:30]  complain that's a  money saver then  it is right there  you just fly into  them if you take  the cost of the  plane ticket off  you're doing very  well you have to  take that fucking  450 off the top  yeah right off the  top uh you're at  the stress factory  i will be not right  now but i will be  you will be tonight  and tomorrow  tonight tomorrow  only oh we'll do  two tonight two  tomorrow have you  worked out there  jim oh many times  many many it's  like my home club  everyone knows  that new brunswick  new jersey it's a  seven three two  five four five  jimmy what well  because vinnie knows

[01:41:30]  come over and they're  like it's 95 degrees  the water and i just  don't care because um  i look at all the  problems that we had  as a planet up until  this point it hasn't  been as i like to say  hunky dory uh all these  years up until now and  no matter what the  older generation does to  fuck things up the  younger generation comes  in and figures out how  to fix it so no matter  what we do the earth's  still gonna be spinning  and uh yeah you 
[01:42:00]  alone are not is you're  not gonna screw up the  uh the environment  thank you kevin have  your sports car but  nobody else should do  that no no no i'm just  saying you should be the  exception i get upset as  a matter of fact when i  see other people doing  what i do i go you're  being very selfish and  greedy and uh our  how how what of the  children what of the  children that's not too  far off though streisand  got caught doing that  you know she's very  preaching about you know  energy saving all that  so then she's got her  fucking air conditioner  24 hours when she's not  even there so the house  is like 60 and then her 
[01:42:30]  publicist or spokesperson  said well barbara doesn't  say that she does that but  she was saying that it was  some horrible thing oh it's  not her they handle it so  not as i do they handled  they couldn't have been  worse if she said look  you're poor you should all  be killed i say more  solar power less  electricity and we start in  the prisons no more  electric chairs solar power  chairs solar chair it's a  much more humane way to go  it's a slower death gym  start off with a nice tan  yeah and uh and then the  vacation's pretty much it  probably initially would  just feel like one of  those old arcade machines 
[01:43:00]  of how sexy are you will  you hold on and get  shocked and then you just  realize okay it's killing  me solar power you start  doing stand-up were you  stand-up when you started  coming i don't think we  ever met i've known who  you are for many many years  yeah it's like uh i've  seen you run out there  too and you just wrote a  book a while back a while  yeah two years ago yeah  yeah but you know  comedians you just we had  never met and uh you  started doing stand-up  before you were acting  oh yeah yeah stand-up is  what i wanted to do and i  never had any intention of  doing anything else it's i  wanted to be a stand-up  comic so i moved out to 
[01:43:30]  la from connecticut and  got into stand-up and uh  i've been doing it non-stop  for it's been over 30  years now remember when  you first start out you  know people say how long  you've been doing this  and you go oh it's like  two years yeah four years  whatever and that's what  it seemed like for a long  time it's just four years  and you got you know you  could say so you know if  i'm not that good that's  why i've only been doing  it for two two years three  years you know and  then it turns out now it's  like 30 it's like there's  no excuses and guys that  time too so it looks like  we're prodigies like if  someone says uh if you're  doing it eight years and  someone's like how long  you're doing it you go  oh four years like wow  pretty good for four years 
[01:44:00]  you know it's a way to  make ourselves look more  naturally gifted yeah  oh unless somebody goes  oh wow really because i  thought it was like two  yeah no see a hooker will  never say 30 i've been  doing this for 30 years  never they'll say i'll  just like uh i'm just a  couple weeks it's my  first time yeah and  they'll never tell you  you're the fifth client of  the day but you'll  suddenly know yes you  will she sneezes and  there's tapioca on your  rug um oh i was  gonna oh fuck man do 
[01:44:30]  you have your old tapes  do you watch your old  shit like from uh when  you were in your first  five years do you have  any stuff from then oh  god yeah yeah i mean i  just ran into um um  norm crosby and he was  the first tv show i did  norm crosby's uh i think  it was comedy hour or  something like that wow  and uh and he he reminded  me that i did his show  but yeah i've got all  that stuff the tonight  show letterman so you  did it with johnny  though right yeah  how many carsons you  know i don't even know  a bunch i don't know  fuck i mean not it was 
[01:45:00]  a bunch but i did i did  maybe uh maybe a half a  dozen with carson and  then i did all the  guests you know gary  shandling joan rivers  yeah yeah anybody who  guessed that i was on  there did you get to do  you get called over to  the couch at all well  this is the thing i  auditioned for the carson  show probably prematurely  you know you audition  you're not really ready  and the guy at the  court coordinator  and so um so i would do  it like i auditioned 
[01:45:30]  several times and i was  i i was so nervous i  would have sweat coming  out of areas i never knew  like i had sweat coming  out of the back of my  knee dripping down my  leg as i was auditioning  you know and then you  finally you finally get to  do it and um and that's  and i had like a three  day notice that i was  going to do it and so  all i'm doing is in my  head i'm going over my  five-minute act i'd be  talking to people on the  street i'd be nodding my  head like i'm listening  but really i'm going over  my act in my head for the  tonight show and then  they the curtain opens up  i go out there i swear to  you i forgot my act on the  way out to the tee yeah 
[01:46:00]  because everybody's  applauding and johnny's  sitting right there with  that man it's like here i  am and the applauding and  the applause is starting to  die down and you realize  you got to go you got to  say something but luckily  i remembered it and  you ever have to talk  for a second sometimes  you got to just talk to  get your mouth moving it's  like how's it going it's  uh things are okay and  then you're like oh there  we are and then you  finally land on where you  have to be it's fucking  terrifying better it's the  worst one it's the worst  when you get out there you  forget what you're going  to say and your first line  out of your mouth is so  what else is going on so  johnny hey have a hand 
[01:46:30]  for johnny but i did get  i got panel the first i went  out uh and uh i finished my  stand-up act and you don't  want to turn to carson yeah to  get the you know you don't  want to look like you're  begging right you know can  i sit please yeah yeah so  you kind of as you're about  to leave you kind of look  over and wave to him and he  waves and then i get behind  the curtain and the talent  coordinator who i you know  was sweating in front of so  many times goes i think  stay here because i think  johnny wants to talk to you  after the commercial so  that's what happened and he  brought you out brought me  out that's great left back 
[01:47:00]  of the kneecap stains on the  chair yeah you get up it's  all wet you should have  showed some balls and just  walked over and sat down  regardless of what he said  you should have done like two  lines and just walked over  started doing panel yeah or  when he goes stick around  johnny wants to talk to you  i don't think so yeah i gotta  go somewhere yeah you should  have thought about this  earlier my fucking flights in  two hours stupid trying to  upgrade yeah i'm always amazed  by guys i obviously never did  carson um and i'm always  jealous of guys who did carson  because he's just the greatest 
[01:47:30]  it's like you never realized  that he was saying he had  information beforehand like how  would he know that you went  scuba how the fuck would he  know that yeah unless somebody  told him that he's just a  master of lobbing up questions  to people yeah and he would  always preface it by saying  i don't know somebody told  me you know oh yeah it's  somebody yeah yeah i understand  that researches you but you  know that the sad thing now is  um a lot of times if people  have done a tonight show with  johnny carson they don't put  it on their resume because it's  a little too dated oh right  because it's 393 right right  long time oh wow you've been 
[01:48:00]  around that long yeah yeah  like you don't see a hooker put  johnny carson on her resume no  never no no no so i guess you  don't put uh the other uh what's  his name the deaf guy that you  were talking about earlier that  uh norm crosby norm crosby i guess  you don't put that on the resume  either uh that's probably not  there either but that was a while  ago that was during the days i  love that when they had the old  variety shows and they would  always yell the announcer and  i'm on the norm crosby show with  the guest star kevin ehler you  never wait yeah doing i mean i 
[01:48:30]  did merv griffin mike douglas john  davidson show wow yeah i remember  john davidson was he on uh real  people or one of the no no what  was shows one of those uh one of  those shows another guy yeah no no  no but that was skip stevenson  sarah purcell and uh byron allen  was he right was young that's  incredible john davidson he was on  one of the one of those shows yeah  fucking yeah one of those shows  that got huge ratings and you watch  now and go why yeah what were we  watching did you know skip  stevenson he was a stand-up he  died i didn't know him that well  yeah he did on the poor guy huh 
[01:49:00]  you didn't know him i just  just say hi to him you know i  didn't really were you still doing  uh stand-up like during snl when you  yeah yeah really oh yeah uh after  this first season uh dana carvey  dennis mill and i went on a tour that  was sponsored by swatch swatch oh the  swatch tour i mean like like during  when the show is was on not hiatus or  anything oh yeah we go out to clubs  around town here clubs yeah yeah it  seemed like um a lot of work well you  know people they always say you know  that schedule on saturday live must be 
[01:49:30]  grueling well it is if you got a  couple sketches going oh but if you're  not you know if you're like in a  couple of sketches but you're just  kind of background yeah a couple  lines you know you got the whole  week to go out and hit the clubs and  you know so we go to catch rising  star or comic strip or improv any of  those clubs would it piss you off  were you like god damn you know um  you know what sketch in the  beginning there was only like eight  of us on the cast when i first came  on i came on with phil hartman and  uh dana carter what years were you  there i was there 86 to 95 oh you  yeah nine years wow yeah so um so you 
[01:50:00]  know we usually were in a lot of the  show but then as the years picked up i  stayed there for nine seasons and other  people left and i was kind of like the  inmate that never got you know i  didn't leave couldn't get paroled so i  saw a lot of cast members come in and  then there in the last couple years of  my uh run there there was a there was a  lot of people on the cast the intros  took maybe 15 minutes yeah it's  starting to the point where it was  like wow it's featuring featuring it  the featured player and hanging  around key grip what you gotta have 
[01:50:30]  one of the daryl hammond i think has  the longest run but you gotta be very  very close behind that daryl's the kind  of guy you go is he still on the show  yeah i still don't know if daryl  especially left the show you see daryl  on a show you're like is this a rerun  but you know occasionally i'll have  somebody ask me to say now are you  still do you guys tape in new york  are you still on the show i said no i  left like uh 95 15 years does it feel  like that long no it doesn't in fact i'm  just coming up here i looked over at  30 rock and i thought wow i just felt  like it just brought me right back  again i remember walking to that 
[01:51:00]  building many mornings you know our  afternoons thinking sees what am i  gonna do did you um what did you leave  under good circumstances or because i've  heard it can be a very difficult place  to work i mean you know i was really  like i was like the guy in there who i  knew what it was i knew it was a great  gig um i wasn't in a rush to leave  you know i love working obviously  different hosts you know and um and it  wasn't like you know i had a lot of  heat on me on that show you know i did  couple skits here and there characters  hans and franz mr subliminal yeah but i 
[01:51:30]  saw people come in and they were very  ambitious and they wanted to be stars  overnight and and it would drive them  crazy you know they would i guess that  didn't work out too well yeah yeah oh  so you and daryl he came in 95 to 09 so  he basically came in as you were leaving  he took over for me yeah we were both  great impressionists that was the other  thing i didn't do like a lot of  impressions when i first before i got on  the show um i lived in a home in the  hollywood hills i shared with a couple  of comics and uh one of them was dana  carvey he rented an apartment over our  garage and uh he would come down from 
[01:52:00]  san francisco and he'd stay there and we  were friends and he got uh on that  summer he got uh picked to be on the  show he auditioned um and he got the  show and i was dating jan hooks at the  time and she was up for the show and i  was i was a stand-up and i never  thought because i didn't do characters  or impressions you know i was just a tall  funny guy and uh dana calls me and i was  reading backstage live from saturday live  just kind of you know excited for both  of them yeah they're going to be on the  show what a magical house it was a  magical house i lived with florentine 
[01:52:30]  two abject failures so you're with dana  and then david spade used to rent my room  from me sublet from me when i went to do  saturday night live and then he eventually  got on the show right um so anyway um  but another one of my roommates has  cancer now so it's not a real lucky uh say  one person had to well pay for your  success that's true so anyway dana  calls me from lauren michael's house in  amagansett one one summer night uh  before he was on the show he goes hey  hey man i'm out at lauren's lauren's  house amagansett guess who's out in the 
[01:53:00]  kitchen i said who somebody bill murray and  uh you know kill around her no way yeah  yeah yeah i'm there jesus is great he  goes hey i think they need another guy  on the show they need another cast member  looking for one and i told about you and  i think they might be interested they  might want to see your tapes i said  really bill murray bill murray's in the  kitchen and and not thinking anything  would ever come of this because you  know i don't do characters or  impressions and so um i send my tapes  you know they want to see my tapes i  send them never think anything would  come of it and a week later dana calls  me again hey guess what i'm back out  at lauren's house guess who's in the  kitchen you know chibi chase dan 
[01:53:30]  akron no way really i think they like  their tapes i think they're gonna fly  you in i think they're flying me for an  audition and uh i i never like believed  it from the get-go and they flew me in  and i think i'd be the only one going  in but of course there's a whole plane  full of people auditioning sure  the tonight show the pilot even comes  out of the cockpit hey you guys think  this is funny for my audition and uh so  you know i get there and i what is the  process you have to go in because i  remember when daryl hammond was going  through it what yeah what do you what  happened what do you what's your first  audition for these guys well back then  um they brought us up to studio 8h and 
[01:54:00]  um it was right in the studio which is  pretty intimidating yeah and they had a  camera kind of set up by the bleachers  off to the side and they were all  sitting the people that were on the  cast already were sitting behind the  camera with lauren and you get like i  don't know five minutes or whatever to  do your stuff with people who are the  the cast yeah yeah they're sitting  there and so you know i just did some  my stand-up i did some stuff that dane  and i used to kid around with in our at  our house um but you know just pretty  much being myself and then the uh you 
[01:54:30]  know i did my audition flew back home  never thinking anything would come of  it and a week later i'm meeting with  lauren michaels uh and he's you know  offered me a job as a feature player  which is seven shows you know guaranteed  to be you know in and my manager said  well you know we can't really do that  you can't survive in new york just being  a feature player on saturday night live  you know so let's make him a writer too  and get you know at least four thousand  dollars a show so um that's what i did  i became a writer and a feature player  for a year and then they made me a cast 
[01:55:00]  member the next year when you uh who  who was uh what cast members were  watching you like who was particularly  intimidating um nobody was  intimidating because i knew i wasn't  going to get the job oh really you just  wrote it off like it was john lovitz  dennis miller dana was there uh norah  dunn lauren michaels and then some of  you know uh the um production people  how long has he been on line 12 just now  oh he just called in okay he's been  there a little while has he a little  while we have kevin neiland so i  figured two kevins is a little a little 
[01:55:30]  while kevin kevin's just hanging out  probably smoking pot he probably doesn't  even realize he dialed the number yeah  he probably just fucking fell asleep with  a joint in his mouth hey let's uh if  you could excuse us uh for a moment  feel free to step outside or no no no  not at all you know kevin smith oh yeah  yeah i've met him a few times yeah i did a  radio show with him in san francisco once  oh cool hi kevin kevin smith huge huge  snl fans are listening to neil and go  on it's like porn i was i memorized that 
[01:56:00]  backstage at snl book backwards and  forwards before i wanted to make film  that's all i wanted to do in life was  write for saturday well i'd not even be  on it and when i went to college up in  the city i went to the new school for  social research eugene lang for a  semester um i'd skip classes just go  down to 30 rockets sit in the lobby and  wait to be discovered i didn't know that  as a writer dude with nothing on no  placard saying i'm a writer just  literally sitting there going lauren  michaels will know when he walks back i  don't think you yeah i don't think you  could be discovered as a writer just 
[01:56:30]  sitting there i was fucking retarded it's  not quite like carrie grant as a soda  jerk in the days where i tried and then  successfully completed sucking my own  dick so i wasn't using my head that  straight but mr neil and that was so  thrilling to listen to i would listen to  fucking ten hours of that oh thanks i  have about nine and a half hours of that  but you know it sounds like carby has  ten hours you know getting outside a lot  of people do ask me they say hey how can i  get on that show and and it and is like 
[01:57:00]  trying to go out with a real hot woman  yeah you gotta just ignore it ignore it  you know and let it come to you yeah you  gotta i guess have a radio show make a  lot of money and that's the only way it'll  happen for you see i'm talking about the  only way i could get a girl  see self-deprecating humor you do great  anthony you do amazing he does an amazing  impressionist i mean impressions are very  important that show that's groundbreaking  information by jim norton impressions are 
[01:57:30]  good on snl back to you guys i'm always  trying to i'm not only never heard of a  college for social research is that where  you went kev yeah i was the i went to the  new school for social research that's  where they do uh it's over on 12th i think  it is it's where they do uh the you know  the inside the actor's studio i think  shoots in their theater and inside the new  school they had a couple colleges one was  called eugene lang i think um parsons school  of design was also part of it at that time  it was like a mall for colleges  obviously i went to the food court 
[01:58:00]  what were you hoping to achieve by going to  that uh i just had to go to college my  brother sister went to college and you know  that's what you're supposed to do i love  the go to college just because you have to  and have no idea what you're doing there  doesn't exist anymore that that thought  process has fallen away yeah now that that  whole generation has ceased to exist the  whole like well you got to go to college  to make it work you know and nowadays  that's not even the case so why do people  go to college then yeah what the fuck 
[01:58:30]  are there actually wants to start life that  early man no one wants to jump in the deep  end of the pool like let me tread here in  the kitty end for a little while yeah the  school end yeah and why wouldn't you  looking back now it's just like man i wish  i'd wasted more time in school yeah but  you know what it is i every body the waste  to be fair before i get slipped by every  college  for some people it is a waste for some  people career education for me it would  have sucked to sit around for another few  years because i wanted to get going  everyone i know that is in college now 
[01:59:00]  though is freaking out like i don't know  one person that's going to college that  isn't freaking out to the point of tears  and like like this is too much pressure  and stress and that because the illusion  is shattered back in the day it used to  be if you go to college you're going to  get a good job yeah and i think a lot of  people went to college there's a good  percentage of found out that wasn't even  true back then but now there's nothing  close to a guarantee you're going to get  any job let alone a quote-unquote good  job by going to college and you know when  you start off doing stand-up comedy you 
[01:59:30]  you have like an education whatever or  you have a job to fall back on you  always say to fall back on i don't  think anybody's ever fallen back on that  backup job back on the trade yeah i did  some roofing yeah i could always go  back you know go back on comedy go from  doing carson and you know that to a  roofing yeah no well you start to jump  off the fucking roof if it came to that  i'm sure you know people too like i know  guys that go back to doing from stand-up to  doing real jobs after 15 years i'm like i 
[02:00:00]  don't know how you fucking just relate to  people like that i'm no stand-up but i've  always been prepared to go back to the  regular world and stuff and i know i could  get a job at almost any fucking convenience  store on this point please they love you  there i'd be like hire me for  appearances at your convenience store yeah  you'd you'd go behind the register uh to  be taught how to do it and they go no  could you just stand out in front yeah i'm  like just seriously i'm a good worker  though you don't want your work fat boy  just stand there stand by the door all  right now right now you've lost your job 
[02:00:30]  you can't do jim you can't do stand-up  anymore what are you gonna do honestly um  i i don't know lottery tickets dude i  really i have not i purposely didn't  leave myself a safety lottery tickets or  buying lottery tickets um i don't know  i have no comprehension of what i would  do i purposely said there's this i  dropped out of high school so i have no  uh no no backup plan you really just  all eggs one basket yeah i probably put  on a little a little push-up raw and i  would just start filleting man not even  for money just because i was being a  self-hatred spiral is this part of the 
[02:01:00]  question or just today yeah it's just  something i was random thought how about  you anthony uh well i i was uh in the  construction field i did install uh air  conditioning and heating uh systems so  you much like you're seeing here but no i  would never do that again i don't know  what i'd do because i couldn't bring  myself to be cutting a piece of sheet  metal in an attic with a net helper and  go guess who i used to be really huh  what oh that show yeah you guys got in  trouble for something could you pass me 
[02:01:30]  that clinch collar yeah great yeah i'm  honest when i first started uh doing  stand-up on the road i was working with  brad garrett at this club in oklahoma  city and we we come into town and nobody  really knows who you are i mean i did a  few talk shows by then maybe i did a  tonight show and uh and we you know they  typically pick you up from the airport and  they bring you either to the condo or they  bring you to the club so you kind of  check in you know and yeah so they bring  us into the uh the club and we go to the  receptionist in the office and um she  goes can i help you and and uh i told her 
[02:02:00]  we're from the air conditioning unit from  the air conditioning company because we  uh because it's pretty hot in there and  uh she goes oh oh no she asked us she  goes are you guys from the air  conditioning company we said yeah yeah  of course and uh and she goes oh great  great and uh we we uh looked up at the  ceiling and i said uh can you take a  look let me take a look up there i  stood we stood up on our desk you know  pushing papers all over the place we're  taking tiles off of the ceiling you  know we're saying oh this does not look  good we didn't know a thing about her  yeah this is bad um we're gonna have 
[02:02:30]  to uh shut down the uh the room for  about three days oh no no no you can't  do that we uh we've got the shows oh  who's coming in um uh bill garrett and  uh ken ken nielsen ken nielsen it's not  gonna work we're gonna have to take out  all these ducks and put up some cinch  tape we're just making up names she  doesn't know either but that's what she  gets for not knowing who we were exactly  two tall cranky comics that's great so  yeah so we put some nice air conditioning  in there and then we made a couple of  extra thousand dollars that weekend 
[02:03:00]  it was it was one of the it was one of  the worst jobs ever because uh no one  wants air conditioning in the winter so  you're in attics constantly that are  120 130 degrees in the middle of the  summer when they decide uh they want  that and then you're such scum of the  earth that if you you you're sweating  you want water and you just kind of  poke your head down from that attic  hole in a hallway or something and go  excuse me uh can i have a glass of  water and i swear to you i've gotten 
[02:03:30]  the hose is in back oh in back of the  house and you have to get down from the  the and that's a bad job walk out and  now you're just drinking out of this  the hose that's been sitting in the sun  so pvc and water is going into your  mouth is wonderful wonderful water  what's worse than hot water through a  fucking hose it's terrible the only  upside of it is now i absolutely get to  treat all the people that work at my  house like that and i laugh i'm like  work slob that's a bad job but i bet 
[02:04:00]  it's not as bad as the jobs i've had  my worst job kev what was your worst  job my worst job i worked at a cemetery  and the backhoe went out and i actually  had to hand dig some fucker's grave  holy jesus fucking night of living dead  it was bad and right then and there i was  like i i gotta i gotta get funny for a  i thought i had the worst i can't put  fuckers in the earth there's bad karma  to that old school grave digging wow  yeah yeah between that and an italian  baker i worked at for about an hour i  can't stand fucking italian desserts like 
[02:04:30]  that cannoli shit they are awful i don't  know why i got a job i think it's my  mother's like somebody needs help there  she'd been in there and she's like they  had to help one time you better get in  there because you can't just sit around  the house all summer and i want to watch  me i was coming through the door like a  heavy kid and they're like oh fucking  great but they had no idea i got back  there i was like oh my god i hate all  this shit so much it's the only kind of  like sweet or dessert i can't get my  head around it's like that diabetic  candy to some degree so i was just at  one point they were like we need you to 
[02:05:00]  go pick up milk i was like all right and  i went to pick up milk just never came  back never never returned no like  hamilton delivering the fish type in  you're like hurley's father when i  first got into stand-up i worked for  manpower it was a temporary oh the  temp place yeah so you would work these  crappy jobs during the day but you had  your nights off and you made just enough  to pay the rent which which of these  three jobs did i have okay multiple  choice all right um uh car leasing 
[02:05:30]  company delivering cars to the stars  uh cleaning dog crap off of mufflers or  department store santa claus or making  donuts at dunkin donuts that is really  uh wait are you east coast or west  coast uh west coast but i'll eliminate  dunkin donuts well i did that was one of  the jobs though it was a manpower though  but you're that was a good good good  elimination right there i was trying i  was like sherlock holmes in it but you  were  i don't know okay so it narrows it down to 
[02:06:00]  a department store santa claus uh  delivering cars for car leasing company  or cleaning dog crap off of mufflers in a  warehouse i don't really have the  physique for a department store santa even  though i know they stuff i remember i was  23 at the time 20 24 23 but i'm gonna  say it's cleaning dog shit off mufflers  because that's too obscure a job to make  up it really is an odd job well the answer  is off all of them there's no way to win  that one yeah but department store santa  claus i worked in san diego um which is 
[02:06:30]  right over the border from tijuana and i was  a skinny santa claus i yeah i look like a  kid with a beard and was everyone asking  for citizenship what would you like a  hiding place they weren't speaking  english that's the problem i mean these  mexican families would come over with  their kids they were dirty from tijuana  and they were they had no wonder they  were peeing on my lap and they and they  scotch guarded the santa suit because it  would just bubble up on the suit because  this happened before i guess beads up and  rolls off yeah nice and the cleaning the  dog crap off the mufflers that was like a 
[02:07:00]  that the guard dogs how does it get on the  mufflers the guard dogs and it was in a in  a basement somewhere and there's these  tight little shells you had to crawl up  on and the dog crap had been there for  ever and there's mold on it you had to  clean all that up wait how would it get  on the guard dogs for the car lodge you  mean uh no where they stored the  mufflers this muffler shop oh okay an  auto body part i guess it was but then  the dunkin donut one though that um i  wanted to buy a marshall amplifier when i  was like 17 yeah and i was working as a 
[02:07:30]  lifeguard at the time he didn't make  any money and i thought i'm gonna i'm  gonna apply for this job at dunkin  donuts we make donuts at night from 10  to 5 in the morning and that'd be a  lifeguard during the day jesus but all i  needed was like 500 and so finally the  guy the general manager interviews me  you know i'm next and my plan is just to  work two weeks 500 you're out of there  i'm out of there i'm gone and um so he  interviews me it's a nice interview i  think i'm gonna get hired then at the  last minute he goes now you're not gonna  just work a couple weeks and then quit on 
[02:08:00]  me are you because i guess a lot of  people do that wow yeah and i thought  oh my gosh he had me pegged and then i  thought i said i told him i said no no  this is what i want to do i want to make  donuts this is a career this is it and i  see the guy making donuts and he's got  burns all over his arms you know from  the grease it's been there a while yeah  yeah oh battle wound so what happened  two weeks so i worked two weeks and  quit never got the money for the amp oh  wait a minute he he didn't he hired me i 
[02:08:30]  didn't tell him uh you know i was gonna  quit you didn't get paid though i did get  paid oh okay but i didn't make enough  money oh not enough you know i i thought  maybe you were too like bashful to tell  him that you were quitting after two  weeks like he said and just didn't show  up yeah no keep the money i'm sorry i'm  an asshole i did work a job once at  sikorsky uh helicopters in connecticut now  that sounds like a cool job it does but i  was working in the factory i was i was  sanding blades and refurbishing blades and 
[02:09:00]  i said my foreman goes to me after about  a year there he goes what's a what's a  young guy like you do working in a place  like this i said oh i'm just working to  pay off my college loan and to get some  travel money go to europe and he looked  at me goes yeah that's what i said 20  years ago and that scared me so much man i  got out of there like the next year goodbye  that's 20 years later i was out of there  that's what happened with the uh sheet  metal work with the air conditioning  stuff i'd see these guys uh you know they  were they were 60 years old still 
[02:09:30]  climbing rickety ladders and cutting  themselves on what amounts to giant  razor blades these pieces of ductwork and  i i would it just about brought me to  tears i said i i can't i'm not this guy  i don't do this yeah i i swear i have some  type of talent get me the fuck out of  here and there's still a lot of guys  like that working those jobs now that  could be great uh i always said i think  the greatest singer in the world is like  a farmer somewhere in the midwest and 
[02:10:00]  the greatest comic is working at some  machine shop somewhere that just never  got the break but what's the worst thing  for me is when people who come up to like  35 and like yeah you know man i want to  start when i was 21 like you know i wanted  to start when i was like 19 i just thought  of it i never did and it's like oh thank  fucking god i tried it yeah that would  have been me it's been that guy it's  heartbreaking i hear guys in their 30s  and four who just never try it's like  you know just do it yeah i tell you all  you guys you can get early is an absolute  help because uh at the end of the day 
[02:10:30]  look if it hits if it takes then you're  leading this uh bucket of wind life way  earlier than you anticipated but if it  takes a few years then you tend to  appreciate it more and or turn it into  bitterness later on yeah exactly at least  you can make other people's life miserable  exactly that's where you never understood  and you see it a lot um in in um in this  business particularly with like uh actors  because actors face so much rejection on  a regular basis and usually years of it in  a row everyone's always telling them no  you're not this you're not this you're not 
[02:11:00]  this and then you would imagine when  somebody says finally says you're the one  you're right they get tapped and let's  say they make it into that elite 10 percent  or something like that that it would be  slobberingly uh grateful gratitude and  appreciation you'd ever always ever hear out of  their mouths but just like a human being  just like all human beings as soon as you  get accustomed to something good you start  fucking finding its fault yeah just like  somebody you know is just like i'm tired of  fucking julio roberts there's always going  to be a point where you're just like i see  that yes 
[02:11:30]  how good i thought it would be it's just  it's it's now based on how i entered into  my new matrix i'm not as appreciative for  it anymore so you read so many fucking and  meet so many actors who are just like  bitter and and want to like make other  people's lives on set miserable because of  the shit they went through for 10 15 years  of their lives names come on come on  kevin oh man well i think he's just an  option that wasn't just some odd observation  i'm sweating man i'm sweating that was 
[02:12:00]  from experience do you know what a dick you  have to beat upset kevin smith yes it takes it  takes a lot for it takes a lot i think to  kind of hit me in a way of the people i've  worked with hit me in a way where i'm  like oh my god fucking intolerable dick and um  there are people i've worked with people i've  worked with a person who is just the uh absolute  absence of passion whatsoever and i know  people like passion they get paid to do a job any for any  job any that involves you getting up in front of 
[02:12:30]  people or making pretend for a living or making  movies or making entertainment of any sort of way shape or form requires a  degree of passion to get you past everyone else to do it because  otherwise everyone would do it but not everyone wants to do it that on  passion for it some people just like to watch it  but some people like to do it and if you like to do it and you've kind of got  enough passion for it you've got to bring that to work  i worked with somebody who had no passion one of the most passionless  human beings i've ever met male or female i know you can't say it was a male  female it was jim norton come on it was scary it was so fucking scary man 
[02:13:00]  because you're like there's a couple million dollars on the line  whenever you're trying to make a movie and nobody wants to make a bad movie  but when you've got that much money riding on it you want everybody there  wanting to be there wanting to see it accomplished what are some of the things  that that show you like oh my god that person just has no interest in being  here doing okay when you're setting up a shot when you're uh when you're  shooting a sequence and i know this is weird to do uh orally or over the radio  because it'd be so much easier to point and shit but try to bear with me i'll try to 
[02:13:30]  build a little word picture you can kevin you you kind of have a talent for  telling a story there kevin it's okay let's say i'm standing next to a kevin  neiland you lost me what's happening  time i'm standing next to kevin neiland uh kevin and i say kevin there's your mark  the mark is kind of where kevin has to stand  in order to be captured by the cameras so if he's standing to the left of the  mark he's off camera so you need the actor to hit the mark 
[02:14:00]  so i'd say kevin there's your mark you hit that mark and you're gonna say some  shit and that's it we're done and then you say okay action and kevin goes  twenty feet to the left of the mark and then you go huh maybe it's me maybe i  didn't explain myself correctly and you say cut you go over you go i'm sorry  kevin i didn't mean over there when i said the mark i meant this mark right here  where all the cameras and lights are pointed  and he goes where the cameras and lights are inside the studio  and then kevin would go okay okay and then i go back and i go action and then kevin  walks 15 feet to the right of the mark and then you're like okay is he is he just is 
[02:14:30]  he mean or just willfully retarded at this wow  and then you go over you go i'm sorry dude maybe i didn't it's it's here it's right  this is the mark oh okay i got you and then you go back and you kind of wipe the  sweat off your brow and kind of smile awkwardly at everyone around the monitors  who are like what's going on and then you say action and then he just walks over  to the craft service table and then you wait on action i'm not lying you'll do 
[02:15:00]  that four more times before you realize what he basically wants is for you to go  wherever he wants to go so basically you're like okay that actor is going to  set the market ladies and gentlemen let's readjust as soon as he lets us know  what it is like somebody who's literally working against the production just  sitting there to be like how can i fuck with it today that kind of passionless  piece of shit you get the work with that person you appreciate any actor i know  who you're talking about maker i would love anybody who wants to be there you 
[02:15:30]  suddenly appreciate more than anything in life  they're not good at their job the fact that they come with passion to do it  right and a willingness to learn i'd take that a thousand times over the person  who steps on the set is just like yeah i'll be here i'll do it when i want to did  you argue with this person because kevin's a very easygoing guy on set i  mean i can't picture you ever being rude to anybody or shouting did you argue with  this person i couldn't that's not in my fucking makeup and that's what i believe  that person wanted some people you meet need drama need to create drama to create 
[02:16:00]  drama like they need to create literally create some fucking off-camera drama so  that they can go and take that onto the fucking oh it's part of the process  yeah they're like hey man that's my process this dude wasn't even that i mean if it was  that i could deal with it because it's like hey man it's wacky but at least this person's  giving me yeah i know who you're talking about okay fucking ben affleck man you're right  fuck that guy they say he's a good director now  yeah right you know what gets me did you see the town no i haven't seen it yet he did a fucking 
[02:16:30]  awesome job yeah where'd he learn his shit where'd he learn his shit kevin  me because i saw that picture i was like where'd you learn your shit but he was off frame a little  bit you know i noticed he was off frame a little bit here and there you know what gets me too is  when people um are surprised that somebody's nice kevin nealon that's no way to get a job in ben  affleck's movie telling him he's off frame and shit i'll never get a job in one of his movies  sure you will man you're fucking kevin nealon do that yeah he actually offered me or there was a  role that he wanted me to do and i couldn't do it lying you're right just felt good to say that 
[02:17:00]  you know it always surprises me when people are like think somebody's nice guy in in the business  and they're surprised by it you know yeah it's like you know this guy you know kevin he's a nice  guy he's one why shouldn't he be really nice guy kevin really it's like this yeah i think they should  all be nice guys exactly for what they're when someone says to you you're going to be able to  make pretend for a living you know what your job in life is going to be the same shit you did when 
[02:17:30]  you were nine right right and you get to dress that way as well that's when like why would i  ever be bitter why would i ever be fucking yeah you want a huge portion of what is the life lottery  yeah you know yeah and and you lucky the lucky lucky few man where it's just like here's a bunch  of money go make some shit up yeah dude blows a donkey like very good very good hey kevin what was  your first writing job uh it was i wrote clerks i mean i never got that was it really it was i mean i  guess the first time i was paid to write something was on mall rats right really as clerks i wrote 
[02:18:00]  for nothing and we shot for nothing and then i went and pitched mall rats universal after we went  to the sundance film festival in 94 and they bought it and they paid me to write i think i got paid like  let me think 75 grand or something in the righteous box 95 95 and i was like i would have sucked a dick  for that oh what if i was just like 75 thousand yeah yeah right what i'd still pop a cock in my 
[02:18:30]  mouth for 75 g's hey what what do we what who who was in the film you just did now what is the red  what's in the film red state oh we just fucking finished it it is it's the tits dude this is the  hands down the best flick i ever made really so fucking good yeah it's it's this little horror movie  we made i can't wait to show we submitted it to sundance and hopefully we'll hear back who's in it  um it's uh this dude named that i mean there's a bunch of people but uh but i'll focus on one we  got michael angarano who's is a uh you know a teen actor not a teen he's in his 20s um carl gallner 
[02:19:00]  this dude nick brawn this chick carrie bachay um melissa leo who was up for an oscar a couple years  ago for frozen river not last year the year before she's in this movie the fighter that's coming out  she's been in tons of stuff she's on homicide uh she's one of the like most respected actresses  in the business john goodman uh who's just dynamite in the fucking flick i saw john goodman  the other day he's lost about 200 pounds yeah he's really he's pretty i mean he doesn't look  like he did for the last few years i hear he doesn't uh he doesn't stand on his mark though 
[02:19:30]  i hear he doesn't stand on his mark though and uh john goodman's the opposite john goodman now  now kevin neill and back me up when you when you're making a tv program or or a movie generally  speaking they'll have somebody as a stand-in for you yeah somebody where it's like like kevin's  on a set and he's like i don't want to stand here while you light the shot i want to go over there  and text you go over there and do that and then they bring somebody in to stand where he's going  to stand on that mark that i was talking about before where they're lighting and aiming the cameras  and then after about a half an hour of setting up that shot the stand-in is replaced by the person 
[02:20:00]  who's going to be in the scene he's like thanks man and then the dude takes off that's a real job  that's a fucking actual job and then eventually john goodman stands in for himself john goodman  just hangs out on the set all day long he's like i'll be fine i'll be here i'll do it and he just  stands in for himself so he gets himself lit he is a fucking dream and then like he opens his mouth  in the middle of a fucking take or at the start of a take and everything he says he's such a fucking 
[02:20:30]  pro he's been doing for so many years it falls out of his mouth he throws dialogue away and you  suddenly you're like student acting like he's literally having this conversation  like it's watching a pro work somebody's been doing it for years and years it's fucking amazing  my dream is that one person talks about me this way  the big guy and the big gun in our movie is michael parks he plays the  our baddie uh pastor aben cooper because the movie is about the religious fundamentalist michael parks man  holy shit he is so fucking then came bronson motherfucker exactly exactly yes don't win an 
[02:21:00]  award of this movie there's no justice in this world he is astounding in the movie and plays uh  it's this aben cooper character so cool pastor from this church and he is he's a dude who if people  don't know the name he was in a lot of robert and quentin stuff more recently and he always played  great parts whenever he comes out and he's hanging out with his kid and well so number one the older 
[02:21:30]  dude that's michael parks he fucking drops an anvil on him and it's it's crazy it's one of the five best  performances i've ever seen him in my life his uh his dialogue at the beginning of dust till dawn  inside that liquor store was that's why i wrote this fucking fantastic i saw that in 95 i went to this uh  sneak screening that dimension was having and uh bob once he was like can my see this movie can my  and i went and saw it and the first five minutes ten minutes is the scene in benny's world of  liquors and it's michael parks as the sheriff yeah and he is it's for me i was i was fucking like 
[02:22:00]  captive his love at first sight i was like that's the way this dude's delivering dialogue i've never  heard anyone deliver dialogue that before it was so low key but like you were you were completely  fixated on it yeah right then and there i was just and then he dies in the first i know and then  he's just out of the movie he's like what the fuck and i was just like i can't do this man i  can't i can't not work with this man like that dude is fucking astounding what would it be like to  do a whole movie with him and so 15 years later i finally figured out what it was because i didn't 
[02:22:30]  write movies that went for my you couldn't put michael parks and fucking chasing amy you know no  it would have been weird but this movie could absolutely put him in and i finally found something  that's cool man i'll tell you a quick story about um cast and did swear so i was trying to tell  explain to my wife she's like who's gonna play that part and i was like this dude michael parks and  she's like who is he and i was trying to explain it and i was like let me just show you from dusk  till dawn and i bring that the dvd and into uh my room i got this big hundred and three inch 
[02:23:00]  television player uh television player sound like i'm from the television player i watch my i watch my  stories on it so i've got a big blu-ray player attached to it as well pop the dvd in and so  basically you're watching a cinema-like presentation of from dusk till dawn and so we watch the first  10 minutes and shit and now you know i turn it up because i like my shit loud um and so uh after  it's that after i pause it because the kid comes in the room harley and um you know the movie's a  little grown up and shit so i pause it don't want to see it and uh we were like what's up and she's 
[02:23:30]  like the the police are outside and i said what and i look out the window  and i see a cop is talking to uh reina uh our housekeeper and so i go downstairs but before i  go downstairs i get i kind of go over to jen i'm like what should we do and she's like what do you  mean they probably have nothing to do with us i said they're talking to reina and i look back at  the window and reina points and the cop looks up at me and i wave at him so i don't know what else  to do and he goes do you live here i said yeah he goes get down here right now get down here and i 
[02:24:00]  said okay and we had just had some baja fresh delivered and i felt weird i felt scared because  you know as i as we all know i like to imbibe in this house from time to time so suddenly i was  like what's gonna and i just imbibe fairly recently i said what's gonna make me look the most low-key  and casual and i grabbed a container of baja fresh chicken with it that i just bought and took it  downstairs with me open the door and the the cops do that thing where they take one step backwards put 
[02:24:30]  one hand on their hip and one hand extended forward holy shit what and there's two of them  at the door and i'm and the doorway and it's my kid behind me and she had two friends over  and my wife's behind me and i just saw reina as i was coming to the door i was like reina what did  the police want she's like oh i don't know mr kevin everything's okay she doesn't speak much english  so i was just like all right open the door cops hands on hips and shit my kid goes all wide  out and the cop goes how many people are in this house and i go uh like i didn't know i was gonna have  to do math that quickly so i was just like well it's me this one is mine so there's about six 
[02:25:00]  he goes why don't you step outside and you just step outside right now i was like okay and i'm  still holding the chicken he's like what's out i was like chicken and he goes what's got what's  going on who's in this house and i was like what are you talking about he's like we got a call  um from somebody uh some neighbor or something said that there were screams for help coming from  inside the house oh man and i go i i go honestly i have no idea what you're talking about i said  we're the only ones here i said my my friends uh my kids friends are over as me and the wife we're 
[02:25:30]  just about to have a bottle fresh as you can see i'm holding chicken right here as you can see and  then one of the other policemen goes like no no it wasn't a neighbor somebody walking down the hill  called it in and the guy goes oh because at first at first they were implying that the call was coming  from inside the house i was like wow this is like when a stranger called yeah no shit but uh i was like  somebody walking down the hill he's like yeah they said that somebody was crying for help out the  windows um and and my kid is like breaking down at this point man she just starts like getting sobby 
[02:26:00]  and she's never seen anything like this yeah it's just like the police are like get out of your house  little kid and and the whole time like she's upset for one reason i'm upset for another reason because  i'm like did i leave a joint upstairs in that ass so uh they're coming into the house to kind of look  around because of this phone call they got and i go officer wait by any chance um are you guys here  looking for the gecko brothers and he's like what do you mean i was like i got 103 inch television  upstairs man and i was just playing the opening scene from from dusk till dawn that too is kind 
[02:26:30]  of a hostage situation there's a lot of screaming um and the cop he was older he looks to the younger  cop he's like is this true and the younger cop goes yeah it was the best part of the movie  and he goes uh he goes all right well uh let me just take a look inside and they walked into the  house and looked around a little bit and they're like okay everything seems to check out and i was  like thanks thanks so much man thank you and and you know he was i was like i i he was like i'm sorry  we bothered you i'm sorry like i said dude if that's your response to something like that i'm more than 
[02:27:00]  happy to to you know be involved you guys were great uh now i feel super safe if something ever does  happen you'd never have to apologize about coming in here and so they left and i closed the  door and my wife is looking at me with wide wide fucking eyes and she's kind of breathing heavily  now and i'm like so yeah that's michael parks who's going to be in our movie cut till later all  the cops are sitting there eating chicken with them watching the whole film they stayed outside for like  five minutes though man like they you know they were like well we kind of believe what he says it 
[02:27:30]  was i like the fact that they came in the house because for all they knew there's somebody standing  behind the door with my kid with a gun to their head yeah yeah and then they leave they were like they  didn't they didn't buy my whole like it they started like getting in my kid's face not in  their face like yelling at her but they were just like um what's your name honey who lives here who  lives here and i was like that's my daughter i was like i'm not asking her not asking you so i'm  asking her because they want to make sure that i'm not like i answered the door in a robe i'm  carrying fucking fistful of chicken you're not the bad guy yeah i could be the dude that was in  there being hey everybody this is my house now like by the way how was the baja fresh chicken

[02:30:30]  smodcast that you did of the back to the future but is there any talk about how doc is just basically  a lunatic like he's a madman with a suicide plan no but but that's kind of it i mean why talk about  that that's part of the plot oh yeah a lot of the yeah right a lot of the uh shit coming up since  it's the 25th anniversary and they've been doing so much 25th right yeah yeah they've been doing so  much uh publicity with it re-releasing the movie and everything uh a lot of people have come up with 
[02:31:00]  these new theories that um i don't know what to make of them one was that doc brown uh at the very  beginning of the movie knew exactly what was going to happen the whole fucking time like he already had  the vest on he knew marty was going to go and take the car from the the nobody he didn't know that  yet but he didn't have the vest on the beginning of the movie no he had the vest on after all the  events happened so he would have that knowledge after marty would write the letter yeah but wouldn't 
[02:31:30]  in the beginning of the movie no vest end of the movie he doesn't know no no no he didn't i'll tell  you why because tell me because uh that universe no longer exists yeah but in that universe doc brown  died he was shot dead yeah in that universe see marty changes he changed it's that whole tangent  universe thing like they might as well be living in a tangent 1985 it just worked out paradox loop  though where it happened before it's just we didn't we didn't see the beginning of the movie we just saw 
[02:32:00]  like a middle point in what would just keep going and going yeah like that it's kind of like the the  the architect scene in the matrix this is all happened we kind of like it's happened a zillion times  of all these variations sooner or later marty gets to a white room where a dude clicking it's just  like you fucked up again you're supposed to fuck your mother now go back and do it all right now i  could shoot that theory shit it wouldn't have been the twin pines mall then it would be what the lone 
[02:32:30]  pine it would have been lone pine right if he would have went through all that shit he went through  oh yeah that makes sense ah that makes sense ah lone pine when he comes back isn't it lone pine mall  when he comes back yeah yeah i hate this fucking movie i fucking hate back to the future not stand it  i'm still more interested in the fact that uh doc says uh if my calculations are correct then when  this baby hits 88 miles an hour you see some serious shit because then he then grabs michael j fox marty 
[02:33:00]  and he's not sure if this thing is going to happen or not so he's basically and he knows that he just  stole plutonium from a bunch of libyan terrorists that are coming to get him so he knows that he's  going to bounce to to the either the future or the past wherever he wants to go if it does work  yeah but if it doesn't work he knows that he is libyan terrorists coming to kill him so to clean up  his little mess that he's made he figures that he'll commit suicide and drag marty and the dog into it  so that way no one's left so he gets hit by the delorean if it didn't disappear exactly 
[02:33:30]  it's just a mess of marty does it's dead it's on video no one understands why and because at least  he doesn't get killed you know from a rocket launcher you know shot by terrorists kevin  will be at the stress factory tonight and tomorrow two shows friday two shows saturday the great  kevin neil and seven three two five four five yes ha ha for tickets uh in new brunswick there you  can get there from the city it's very easy the great kevin neil and and of course kevin smith  uh what's the new movie kevin uh red state we hope to debut it at sundance in january yeah that

[02:37:00]  perfect day for it i mean why not you took a day off everything's going to shit i know right you know  the fucked up thing about taking days off when you have this job because i will always say one of  the easiest jobs ever in life is this fucking job the hardest part is getting up in the morning right  but it's four hours of goofing off and talking right uh never thought i'd get paid for it it's 
[02:37:30]  fantastic uh but when you take the day off you sleep until you would have been home anyway so it's  it's almost a waste believe it or not anthony is the one saying this it's almost a waste to take  a day off you're growing up i like it i woke up and it was like it was like 10 or something 10 30  and i'm like i would have been home already homo already i've been home already i hi sir just take

[02:38:30]  course um from the popular uh show chuck that's that's right yes that's what everybody's uh telling  me i am going to be the biggest asshole ever i haven't seen chuck that's what makes you the  biggest hassle ever no that's that's number probably a laundry list of number 73 all right all right  there's many more before and after believe me i know that what what is what is the uh what is that 
[02:39:00]  about please please explain let me uh break it down for you real quick so uh chuck basically i play a  guy who works in an electronic store like a best buy or something like that and um you get stopped  right there wow wow i'm hooked i'll watch it um and then basically through this crazy series of events  he ends up with all the government's top secrets in his brain so the government sends two of their  best to protect chuck and use him to fight bad guys and terrorist plots and things like that yeah 
[02:39:30]  see that's god it should titillating isn't something different than chuck though because i see chuck and  i think um norris well that or just some guy on a sitcom kind of thing oh yeah that sounds like  something intriguing i appreciate that uh yeah i just you know as long as i can pitch it to people  personally i think well that's just that's where the viewership is yeah you have to go around to  everyone individually every every nielsen home i'm like is this yes and don't stop me at the i work 
[02:40:00]  at a best buy type place no although that's pretty good that is pretty good it's pretty good because i go  to best buy and it's some of the most fun times of my life i usually leave with something i'm very  happy with that's good yes computer electronics guy camera always i have to get like the latest  thing i have stuff in in boxes i'm not that i'm a hoarder i aspire to be oh good not yeah but i have  like boxes of some electronic stuff that i never threw away and it's like old zip drives with a giant 
[02:40:30]  serial port plug that's like a foot wide bunch of ribbon cables and matrix dot printer things and i  should just throw them out you well or you could cobble that all together into your own personal  robot to do your bidding i could do that sort of a la 18 where i can make anything out of anything  yeah make one of those jackie gleason spaceman costumes out of it i'm a man from space i thought  we were being invaded rob yes of course i'm a man from space space can i compliment jack over here 
[02:41:00]  for a second that's why i came in if i may so on the show you play like a nerdy guy that works  at in for the nerd herd this is true like best buys geek squad whatever this is true he knows this  chuck i like this so why he's in here thank god when you watch the show like you know i'm a comedian  and i aspire to do more than just stand up and i watched the show and i'm like i could do something  like this like i could be in a show like this and then you sit next to him and see his stunning beauty 
[02:41:30]  and you're like oh that's why that's why i can't be at the star of a tv he is a handsome fellow holy  crap if i had a nickel for every time i've heard stunning beauty from another man from another man  wait a minute i have the i have all those nickels it's one i have one nickel  you owe him he's exceptionally good lucky you're too kind in hollywood how'd you get that big start  was it looks was it talent what'd you do um casting couch casting couch no man you know i'm really

[02:43:00]  honk a horn or something oh that's good that's awful that's friggin that's not awful that's uh  poignant but i did i went to uh and i had to like get like hey let's get a limo we'll go into the city  we'll dress up we'll go to that friggin uh the russian tea room and then we'll go see cats  just a complete white trash night out in the city every time i think i'm starting to get to know you

[02:44:30]  is so what did that mean to you yeah it's a 23 year old girl you're trying to suck her tits  ass couldn't you prefer jack lemon or alda in this role yeah yeah i really i go every time i go  11 i actually agree yeah you got it and then it got to the point where after my uh after my uh  divorce um and i would start dating i'd have to go to different shows like the little mermaid  oh my god and uh beauty and the beast lion king you know girls of that age like those shows 
[02:45:00]  what they're good shows they are it's music it's dancing it's costumes i felt good about myself i  laughed i cried i got laid it was wonderful look at that oh my god musicals are fucking atrocious  you don't like the uh but disney musicals are different because you're kind of like like all  right i know there's an element of fantasy with that which is a little bit different for me not  quite jim's fantasies no dumping on anybody it'd be a coffee table with a bunch of people squatting over  it's singing fucking belting out arias i was is this a subtle segue into what i've just worked 
[02:45:30]  on yes wow this is really subtle you saw i was with this 23 year old broad i was trying to bet  and uh i know great and zach take it away you saw exactly where we were going with that yeah uh  i just did a movie yes an animated disney musical called tangled no it's true of course it is  tangled and and what do you play well it's just it's basically the story of rapunzel mandy moore 
[02:46:00]  plays rapunzel for that yeah yeah yeah they're good i love that disney animation god damn they get  those little subtle things animation went to crap for so many years and then uh disney's always been  good and they do have those little subtle things that look so good reminds me of my childhood that  should be the uh that should be a review for the movie it is love the disney animation god damn they  got those little subtle that should come up on the commercial at the bottom of the screen  got those little subtle things yes yeah i actually got excited when i saw the trailer for there was 
[02:46:30]  there was one animated one before this the frog princess and the frog yeah i actually i like you know  i'm it's not really i'm not the demographic where but i got excited to see that disney was going back  to the old school actual hand-drawn animation yeah yeah everything's been cgi or cg whatever it's  called it's it's cool but it just kind of got a little well tangled cg i thought it was sorry no  it's all right my job this morning was to just rub all this in your faces that's like listen zach go in 
[02:47:00]  that we're not going to prep them at all you're going to go in you're going to go for the jugular  but it's cg animation it's not it is cg animation story no no no it's like toy story but by the way  by the way it's a valid point look when i first got the job i thought it was going to be 2d because  i was seeing princess and the frog stuff and i was like oh they're going to go back to 2d which i'm a  huge fan of you know what we all grew up watching that kind of stuff but it's look it's it tangled is 
[02:47:30]  it's fantastic man it really is a like a throwback to classic disney animation and storytelling  but you have you know younger audiences now that are accustomed to cg and they're accustomed to 3d and  they're accustomed to all these kind of newer technologies and implementing those into  animation and film so that's the way they went with it and it's still great and you don't really  feel like it's jarring you don't you don't watch it going oh this is cg you watch it go oh this is  like a really cool animated film you know see that's what i meant jesus of course i was talking about 
[02:48:00]  that because i did see the trailer and don't worry it'll go to broadway in a few years  it will and you'll have another day joe thank god you could rent a limo i've run out it's a bad  day from long island it's been in this coat since 88 and you know what i like wearing a tuxedo t-shirt  it cracks everyone up i don't wear the tuxedo it's hilarious oh people seem to love it what you are  also uh uh now this came from our crack staff that's right you like playing black ops i love black 
[02:48:30]  cops yeah i'm a big video gamer in general i yeah but black ops is kind of you know the  the soup de jure yeah as it as it not to use french in any way especially since i don't speak  it but um no it's great man i mean the whole series all all call of duties yeah all the call  of duty as well and i as well i don't know what the correct now you play pc or uh xbox 360 yeah  yeah i started my first person shooter career on pc i could zero in very easy with a mouse and 
[02:49:00]  keyboard i am so i love the nerd that is coming out right now continue roller i am so bad with it  i suck i don't know how people get 20 kills zero deaths things like that when i am i'm pretty much  on the bottom every time three kills maybe one assist 30 deaths yeah i shoot around everybody  i get stabbed constantly by some 12 year old that's calling me a fag or something it's horrible 
[02:49:30]  dude there are nasty nasty kids online it's really not i and and it's really sad because  these kids think that you know there's such an anonymity with an online kind of personality or avatar  whatever and their parents don't know what the heck they're saying so they're getting away with really  atrocious nonsense like racist and sexist and just overall bigotry it's like yeah yeah you want to  reach through the thing and slap them across the face and say i don't care who you are you can't say  stuff like that to people that's horrible i know yeah and by the way that's probably noodle 61 which is 
[02:50:00]  me so i get i get mad though i get so angry i yell at the game i do understand though uh i have a lot  of friends that started playing uh first person shooters or any games really on on their pcs so i  understand the frustration of going from a mouse and keyboard to a controller i only started on  consoles so i never really had the problem elitist elitist you shall not triumph um but i but i love  con i like the controller i always have a hard time because there's so many other keys on a keyboard 
[02:50:30]  that my fingers start finding other things at least it's laid out flat though like the controller it's  like okay i'm hitting the bottom of it the sides of it the top that well the listen father time  yeah get with the program i don't know you kid i liked coleco's football game  are you trying on ps2 or ps3 or xbox xbox yeah i yeah i hate i can't do the ps3 control i hate the 
[02:51:00]  playstation control but the xbox controls i think are very easy to use it's a good economic i'm not  i'm not trying to pawn it off on the controller i personally suck i i'm bad at the game and it  frustrates me because i want to be really good but i'm not i see guys walking around and i'll  follow a group of five guys and i'll be like all right i'll go with these five guys one shot rings  out i'm the dead guy it just never fails i suck how do you do you do you are you good i do pretty  good i i you know it depends on how much time i have to dedicate to any game like you know if i if 
[02:51:30]  like in the off season when we're not shooting and i've got nothing but video game time uh i can get  pretty good i can get pretty good but you know we're during the season i'm at work all day every  day so there's not really enough time to dedicate because the guys that are really good at these  games oh my god spend insane amounts of time yeah playing like crazy to the point where it's not  healthy you know i i can't imagine that they don't have bed sores or something you know just eyes are 
[02:52:00]  constantly beat red and the only thing running through their veins is mountain dew it's there's no  mountain dew and pizza that's it you know how does black ops hold up to warfare 2 because i thought  they released them too close together man no you know what i will say the campaign for i've only  played the campaign really and the campaign for black ops is really good um you know there's this  constant i'm to nerd out just for a second please so please but by all means uh uh treyarch and  infinity ward are the two kind of producing companies that have gone back and forth producing all the 
[02:52:30]  call of duty games right and you know for the longest time infinity ward i think a lot of people  felt like they were the first one they made uh modern warfare one and then they made modern  warfare two and those were the big big sellers world at war was treyarch that was it was a good one  but you know i i don't know but i think treyarch they're they're the ones who did black ops and  they've done a really good job incorporating a lot of the good stuff you like from all the modern  warfare titles you still have your perks and all that stuff plus you have the zombie mode which is a  lot of fun zombie modes you can play as jfk and castro and nixon fighting off zombies i mean yeah 
[02:53:00]  any game that affords you that opportunity i think you need to buy that really is all right  i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get it it is a fun game they got a lot of the similar weaponry and  stuff from the other games but then there's that little the like the little radio control car thing  is yeah just a pisser yeah piss me off i'll be i'll be crouched down waiting for somebody to come  around a corner and hear it's like oh here i come i'm dead yeah great thank you bobby kelly  talked to me about that remote control car for 10 minutes one day he made me watch clips of it on 
[02:53:30]  youtube yeah bobby is just hooked dude they got a remote control car dude and it blows things up  and look at this dude and he was showing me the footage i was like dude it just it kind of just  looked like modern warfare too so i was like i don't know man maybe it is similar but it's new maps  yeah it's new maps it's new guns and you know lots of new gidget gidgets gadgets and gizmos and  you can play as gidget and you can play as people are dead with a surfboard it's amazing yes the uh  bobby kelly though when we were playing with him and fucking uh dane playing with him and 
[02:54:00]  dane cook is a knifer and i wanted to well i wanted to kill him because it was the game but he he would  just stab everybody and it's like oh he's got like 80 kills from just knifing people and i love when you  get the jump on him yeah and i'm shooting with a machine gun at somebody and he runs up and just  knifes me i fall to the ground going i i had a machine gun that's because he likes to keep it  personal yeah it is a very personal yeah it's like you know homicidal people they you know when you 
[02:54:30]  watch 48 at first 48 they find a guy that's stabbed it's like yeah well obviously this isn't uh  this is a personal this is a crime of passion you don't stab someone in the face 80 times um  and just for robbery it's uh david and i uh bonded a bit on the star wars games we were really emailing  star wars galaxies or uh galak well not galaxies um uh old republic the trailers for  old republic and force unleashed too and he sent me one of the trailers and he goes derosa uh watch  this trailer it'll make your dick hard and glow and glow green which i thought was perfect of 
[02:55:00]  course with star wars are you kidding me i flipped that's it check out force unleashed  too that's a fun game i've seen it i've seen it the trailers for it i i was at e3 uh earlier this  year and the trailers for it were incredible and i played the first one i haven't really i've been  playing a lot of fable three because that's what how is it it's good man i mean look you know peter  molyneux and lines you know they they they do a good job with the the game and it's really immersive 
[02:55:30]  and you run around and you know just kind of geeking out like an everquest or world of warcraft  yeah it's kind of yeah but it's it's it's lighter than that you don't you know it's it's deep but it's  not so deep that you are completely lost i liked that but the the trouble with those games are you can't  leave them for any length of time and just come back like i i still have a character from everquest  that from 1998 that i pay a monthly you know whatever it is just just in case i'm like i can't 
[02:56:00]  get rid of it yeah just in case i haven't played it in years because i don't know how to play like  it's a whole new interface they've changed it there's new upgrades new this that i mean and  i'd be in this this zone where nobody is anymore going this used to be where the parties were what  happened yeah and like i don't know how to kill anything anymore but i'm just so that's a real new  level of nerd when you treat a video game character like a gym membership but i remember  i own it i just don't go yeah i just don't go but you do and to be a complete nerd and geek is to 
[02:56:30]  know playing those games and being like i remember that area and like it almost becomes a place where  you knew like i remember running around that place i remember going into that cave i remember having a  pretty pretty hairy battle with something in there like you remember those moments from games  it's sad i understand your look on your face it is sad but it's what it is it's only sad because 
[02:57:00]  it reminds me of my own life that's all i'm not judging i'm just a huge game but i'll play anything  at least to give it a try except you know obvious horrible games but like even sims i played that i like  sim city i never played any of the sims i mean i think i i again i'm i'm like you i think every game  kind of presents a cool thing to check out or try out or whatever but when you have a really limited  amount of time you really you have to narrow it down and be like okay what what do i really want  to play and it's normally first person shooters or some adventure games and yeah you know stuff like 
[02:57:30]  the sims i think is is fascinating especially how they've taken the franchise and they've made this  you know whole world you can create and and all that out of sim city too you know if you go back to  sim city i remember my stepdad playing sim city and being like what is what is this you're making your  own simulated city hence the name genius um but you know it's cool and hurricanes and things and  coming through and and now that you can take over your own these little lives and families and they're 
[02:58:00]  procreating and going to jobs and it's like a juggling act too because you know you can't leave  any one thing alone for too long or else it screws something else up yeah yeah there was always something  very like peeping tom ish about the sims to me like my friend yeah watching him go to the  the boyaristic yeah yeah and i'd go over he was into it and i go over he's like you got to see  this dude look and i and it was the first time i'd heard of it and i was like what i don't understand  what do you do and he's like you just watch these people and make them do things i was like yeah  complex much yeah yeah yeah no it's totally that it's totally that but you know i think people just 
[02:58:30]  get into the whole idea of it but you know every place chess oh just trying to add you  that's okay you're just gonna be placed you don't play in the park with the timers uh no those guys  are uh home a lot of those homeless guys are as good as master level players no i don't at all  how does that happen anyway it's all they do they play for food i cannot get my life together but i  could play chess grandmasters actually one of those washington square to play against because  they're they're they're just they shit talk they play two minute games they're literally 
[02:59:00]  animal talk they're talking and shitting themselves at the same time it's terrible  they're loud they're taunters to king  and then you feel bad because he check baited you and then he goes to sleep under the table  you're like well i guess it all comes out in the wash doesn't it  you just lie in wait don't you you just sit here you listen to us go on and on about nonsense and then  you come out with these zingers that's that's smart that's jimmy that's calculated he sits and fumes

[03:02:00]  and brewer but i'm almost too much show yeah it really is a great show  just short the miami heat yeah comedy shows she came in here she sat in the back we never let  the publicists in the room because they're no no draining life drainers and uh while while while  the guy's doing his interview she taps me and asks for my pen and then she's holding up a sign  to me with his website on it to plug it and i'm like would you do that if it was television  she got mad because she's she's an extraordinarily entitled individual as a publicist and everybody 
[03:02:30]  kisses her ass and she got mad because danny and i reacted annoyed because i'm on the radio and  she fucking tapped me do you believe she tapped him and held up a sign for his website i've never  had that in 20 years you know what i can't believe is that jim did not take it and then rip it up in  her face i know because i'm in a horrible mood already and it would have gotten i would have said  something barbaric to her i didn't want to do that that's radio gold barbaric 
[03:03:00]  and i would have listened i would have listened she's awful she's a very and she's like i don't  know why it benefits you to have a bad relationship with me i don't give a  fuck it's you what wait a minute first of all i'm not having a bad relationship with you you  started being a bitch about that's what you gotta say if all your clients left you what exactly what  talent what do you have what exactly what would you do some place you'd be you'd be barking in  times square for chicago tickets yeah yeah that's what you'd be able to fucking do your fucking cab  driver i told you we have an on-air rule no no publicist in the room it's not about the i i was 
[03:03:30]  trying to let roland and talent off the hook because it wasn't their fault but it's not even  a rule that i don't want him in here of our rules no one lets the publicist in yeah so so if he's  doing conan are you gonna walk out and sit with him on the fucking set of conan and hold up a set  or you're gonna stand by the camera and hold up no she's gonna stay in the back she's literally said  i don't know how it benefits you the aggregate and i'm like well i don't know how it benefits you  to have a bad relationship with us we have a massive audience yeah i don't care if she she's 
[03:04:00]  like i'll never do your show again i'm like i don't care because we were good to work i'm like  we treated him great so it's not about him it's about how he said that to her but she's gonna  fuck over her clients based on how she felt she was treated and by the way fuck you by the way  fuck you i'll never do your show again until one of your clients goes i want to do the opening anthony  show and you bow down and go okay okay you fucking leech you fucking leech that's the problem with  publicist like that you never they should not that's that's why i love my publicist she never 
[03:04:30]  comes in with me i don't need to be coddled stay outside you don't come in here and hold up a sign  to jim norton like that the fucking nerve of that woman while i'm working how fucking dare you  and i know she apologized didn't she see you had your tuxedo on jimmy but she never you were doing  a show she's like she's like i've done a lot of radio shows i've been radio shows before and  that's the respect they have for radio guys that's the way they look at radio as a medium and that's 
[03:05:00]  why a lot of these dumb publicists jimmy that's the truly insulting part is because if you use the  conan defense with her she'll go well conan that's different i said to her would you bring i said would  you would you do it was tv would you be holding up a sign huh it's a talk show but that's my point  she's gonna fucking sit there and tear off everybody and go well you guys are here that's  over there to me yeah fuck her she sounds like a wonderful woman oh she certainly does an entitled  an entitled person and i i did let her know that i'm like you're making it about you it's not about 
[03:05:30]  you no wonder why certain publicists are found in their cars in la wait can we get jesus i thought  where this was going i thought initially i thought jimmy was riffing on this person who got shot like the  beginning of godfather can we get uh billy crud up into the conversation here  he really looks like the guy so much shit there's no way he doesn't he can't get you coke  he's like back in the day he still cut an album like that's the guy was he there when john homes  got murdered in wonderland one of our interns what the hell's his name his name is boogie nights 
[03:06:00]  she threatened to not bring her fucking client in if she wasn't allowed to the studio if i would  have known that yes yes she said no i'm coming in and then kenny went no uh you know you you publicists  stay out here and then she said i my client won't go in unless i that's that's the arrogance of this  woman i don't care who she is i don't care who she handles she doesn't get me booked on the tonight  show she's never gonna help or hurt me is she in every scene uh that he's in in movies and his tv 
[03:06:30]  show is she in the background to make sure she's there with him she's during every facet of his life  i don't care who she i really don't i don't care if she has the whole fucking cast of tron  it's irrelevant to me we've done the show a long time it's the first person she's scared  that her client's gonna come in here and kill it while she's out there and realize that he doesn't  really need her at this level she's a troll the can you imagine i will i i'm not going in if he if 
[03:07:00]  he doesn't go in if i don't go in i wish i would hear my publisher say that i'd fire her on the  fucking spot you're fucking shit you're shit yeah fuck you say shit and we have promos that  supposed to be running for the show they weren't running for the last two days they weren't put  in the system so i'm just in a fucking horrible mood so yesterday we weren't here and the promos  weren't running and that's you know god it's okay i i facebook didn't told people they could buy  tickets like three days ago because that's how good i am on the internet then i got like 20 emails  uh dude just to let you know the tickets haven't gone on sale yet for the borgata it's gonna be huge 
[03:07:30]  january 16th yeah i think it'll sell very well of comedy shows that's how that's if i was a  publicist that that's the spin i would use yep yeah i would too the old spin oh my god i have to  talking to her i hate her even more i have absolutely no respect for her i don't care if  she hears everywhere how did you look at her and not just i'm not gonna yell and curse at her  because again like because you're a professional i even said to her and don't threaten to pull him  i'm like don't hurt the rest of the platform i don't care if you pull him from our show go ahead 
[03:08:00]  but don't pull him from the rest of the show what the arrogance that well then no she will not be in  any of this kingdom i won't bring any of my people that's the problem with publicists and artists  bring it on themselves because fucking artists cower behind their publicists and most of them  have no personalities some should just turn around and go hey lighten up like you weren't for me  fucking people kill me too too how dare you insult me i will never give you the cast of gossip girl  oh you're you're a fucking you're a no talent yeah yeah that's why you do what you do because you 
[03:08:30]  have to associate with the business somehow you have to glom onto it somehow while contributing  nothing artistically you know the interesting story that would have about celebrities that she tells  their family like she's inside yeah but then you gotta tell it like you're so over it and you don't  watch tv right right i don't want to name any names but yeah and if you don't like it i go across  the street to mitchin murray fuck you you're a fucking secretary 
[03:09:00]  that really really and maybe i should have went out there and talked to her but i didn't want to  see roland get blamed for something that had nothing to do with him were you were you nice to  her at least when you told her she couldn't oh i kicked her in the cunt and told her it was procedure  yes that's what i do the bottom line for her saying that there's nothing kenny could have done  to inspire that i was following procedure roland held the door open for the guy to go in  she tried to follow in and roland said no i'm sorry you can listen so i gently tased her and she 
[03:09:30]  goes no i'm going in i'm going no i'm sorry not the fucking fact that she would say to somebody that  works here no i'm going in who the fuck are you you know she sounds like you jimmy did she irk you  dude i know i looked at her face i know exactly the type of person she is i know exactly the kind  of person she is she's every there's nothing there she's entitled to the listeners jimmy has been 
[03:10:00]  standing since i came in here because i is standing up man because for the greater good of the company  i did not curse at her and she thought i was being rude here's the problem nobody confronts that  woman i was just going to say on her awfulness she's entitled everybody kisses her ass i don't  know i'm a stand-up lady i don't give a fuck about who you handle you're not going to handle me you  go you just going up to her was rude to me it was like that was rude to me it was a courtesy that i  showed her is jimmy the greatest he just sounded like archie bunker all you need to do is call it 
[03:10:30]  jimmy why don't you let yourself get this worked up about a piece of shit like that who gives a  fuck fuck i don't care what you don't thank you don't don't don't ever ruin your day dude i'm  already mad i'm already mad because down the hall they were supposed to put our promos in and my  promos for poughkeepsie and they weren't in for two days now i'm very angry about that but that  annoyed me because i saw in her face she's everything i despise and and don't respect  in show business oh geez the publicist wants to come in here what are you coming in here for 
[03:11:00]  why don't you sit over there you can stay outside you did you broad publicist wants to come in and  count his pennies oh jesus i've got to hurt a client like that and not let him promote in front of this  audience it's like do you know how she sounds like she sounds like remember when they did the tv  version of the letterman leno battle remember leno's manager the manager yeah that she sounds  like the helen kushnik yeah like because obviously you never met her in real life the tv version the 
[03:11:30]  book version that's what she sounds like right but i i would have to me to me it was a courtesy to go  talk to her because i guess again publicists they're like every other but everybody else in show  business they're just all behind the scenes sneaks they're non-contributors nobody just talks face  to face nobody just goes look that was our rule that was not rolling that was our nobody  does that and by the way in front of one of our bosses saying that we were assholes we were 
[03:12:00]  assholes it's a great one of our which one of our bosses who was it uh kenny the new boss of the  talent handler that's not our boss oh it's not my boss same as the old boss yeah it's roland's boss  fuck him no no she she she she roland was great to her though i'm teasing of course i love and the  fucking the fucking slave mentality that perpetuates every goddamn artist in this business  that lets these fucking pieces of yeah actually go no i'm the one that needs to be tended to right  now i'm important go fuck yourself you know it to her she was the important one in this whole thing 
[03:12:30]  fuck with whatever you want to say or do or anything she's in i'm not going to say a bad  word about her because i don't know how it helps me to have a bad relationship with that  person she said that you're bill burr you are right but it was almost like i was going over  there if she didn't tap me you want to be on hot 97 ever in your life buddy i can make that happen  she tapped me and held up a that to me was all i needed to know about her the the uh the science 
[03:13:00]  said wanna fuck and i said no the pomposity if i may yeah oh you may the lack of respect for radio  that people like that have this dummy this dummy who obviously doesn't do her job well would rather  have him promote probably on a local news show than on this right show which has a lot more  listeners because they don't understand what radio they're just dumb it's gonna make him more  personable it's not just and he was great it was not doing him no we're talking video games with the  fucking guy it's not like and everyone that comes in here doesn't have to talk about that movie we'll 
[03:13:30]  plug it we'll get it across and everything but how about you let the guy be a human fucking being  and be relatable to people that go oh wow okay that's that guy i'll never do that show again  she's sitting there holding up a sign the blog of the website not for not for nothing and this is  no disrespect to that guy because he was really cool but i was in here when ed norton was in here  you didn't get anything like that with ed norton and ed norton is a goddamn oscar winning fucking yes  right who was i wrong uh it was uh zach um levi yeah no way the guy from chuck yeah chuck chuck holy 
[03:14:00]  i don't know what that is if it's not on espn i don't know what it is i said that it's not a  conspiracy theory yeah yeah let me tell you she you wait a minute she was exhibiting signs of mind  control mind control i think the harp unit was tuned into her that made me laugh so hard just then that  i got lightheaded i almost passed out it was such a shooting laugh that came out of my face 
[03:14:30]  the secret society of the publicists that's what it's all about you know it's it's it's something  that it's the illuminati you know what i like i like when he goes to storm in somewhere and he acts  like they don't know he's coming and you stay shown from behind walking and the camera's there  they're already in the office yeah yeah when he walked in what what are you what are you doing here  yeah i mean you know what's worse wall street boys club those are the only conspiracy theorists 
[03:15:00]  that they put on tv it's just like jerry springer it's the worst of the worst i see things it's that  approach it's the storm in and pretend like you're just storming in thing or it's the michael moore  thing when you walk into the kmart corporate office and they go yeah you can't come upstairs with your  fucking cameras yeah just showed up but he goes well obviously they're hiding so hiding something no  dickhead you can't roll up with a fucking camera crew spur the moment i like the uh the jesse  ventura approach is the ralph cramden approach when he walks in oh cocktail time come on out 
[03:15:30]  hov come on out hov i know you're up to something yeah you know that i don't know that i know  that the harp unit's doing mind control  area 51 i'm not i'm not they got guns let's run not would it be great at the end of every episode  when ventura's stupid theories are proved wrong if he had to act like crammed in when he realizes he's 
[03:16:00]  wrong and make that face and kind of wave his arms around and then just go to the black girl at the  table baby you're the greatest you're the greatest i'm driving the sad thing is he isn't 100 wrong  he's just he's not the guy he's so not the guy he's not the guy if you just sat there and just  talked about the federal reserve in a calm manner yeah yeah first of all they couldn't have it if they  figured out everything was built on sand i'm going in here's the secret building where all the 
[03:16:30]  conspiracy is it why you just fucking ask somebody walk in we spoke with a man in a van in the middle  of the desert that was the most ridiculous thing i ever saw no the worst one the worst one is that  ghost hunters oh like i love how you're gonna watch the episode like this is the episode they're gonna  prove that ghosts exist but for some reason this isn't international news at this point like you're  gonna walk into the office the next day and you just see they proved it the trailer is always some 
[03:17:00]  kind of thing where it's like did you hear that dude i don't know what that was something went ah  and then ghost hunters it's always grainy footage the best part is when they sit there and they get  mad at the ghost and they set up all this stuff and they the ghost always has a name they're like  mary ellen you have 17 minutes to show yourself i love or else what i love that or else what i've been  here a while 17 minutes i could do that on my head i love that fucking reality show like tease i 
[03:17:30]  used to do a bit about that how like they'll be like coming up next on bakers or whatever and i'll  be like it's two guys in the kitchen like i'm gonna fucking rape you and you're like holy  shit i'm like i got it if they raped each other it would have been in the paper six months ago  like they raped each other on this show it's the most dramatic moments that's another one  like uh uh any kind of paranormal activity or something they always have that night vision  it's grainy you see the people's eyes are all open wide and and and you can see their retinas what 
[03:18:00]  was that it's like what was that downstairs and then they run downstairs it's like why don't you  have a camera in every room shaky camera and then you're oh my god tune in for the next and then you  tune in and nothing ever happened yeah but oh my god was like we're on a film oh my god someone  should have gotten the film that's fine i can literally go on the internet and look at my  apartment from outer space see a picture of it and they can't find a ghost in an eight-room colonial  they can't get footage of it that's oh we just missed it that's a great point about not having 
[03:18:30]  a camera and every they literally react like a dad that just had a kid for the first time  we're gonna tape everything quick quick get over he's walking  it's you know what it is it's the music man that's what they're doing with ghosts with ghosts  what does that mean the music man was uh uh this this old musical the guy didn't know anything  about instruments and he came there and he got the town all fucking stirred up that they were  going to put in a pool hall ah jesus joe i can't remember we did it we did it in fifth grade it's 
[03:19:00]  all 76 trombos at the big parade there you go i know that i think i did it in fifth grade too or  yeah yeah i i was oh i told david tell you the story were you were the star or no this is the  best thing you know that song the wells fargo wagon oh jesus they got this thing you know the wells  fargo wagon is a comet but this was their big this was their big excitement ah the big number  like a busby berkeley movie no like back back in the day you gotta you gotta let me get this story

[03:21:00]  guy with the fucking straw hat like a rickshaw yeah the fucking wells fargo rickshaw comes  no dude he he looked like he looked like he was going to be an offensive lineman that's how big this  kid was holy shit oh maybe he fucking took a shit on the stage like a horse would no he was  he wasn't like full on he he was a little touched and there was something about when they he felt  it's like the first time you get a laugh on stage that was his that's bad reaction that's bad when

[03:29:00]  she sounds like she has if she poked you and tore and you nodded and you did that classic  jimmy just tore up guys guys my client doesn't feel comfortable unless i'm sitting behind him  constantly blackberrying the entire blackberrying and then holding up signs when we're having a  fucking human conversation and i could see her from where i was and she sat there with a  fucking scowl on her face is a distraction energy sucking she's the direction it got in my head i was 
[03:29:30]  like is she pissed off at the way this is going like who the fuck is she is she his assistant is she  a cunt who is she's a nobody she's just a publicist and they're in pushy by nature which is how they  get their clients things but i know the balance she was despicable she was despicable and rude and  entitled and i'm telling her in succotash artists that have that fucking person you have an idiot  representing you i don't care who she handles yeah but my publicist pulled that shit i would spit on her 
[03:30:00]  it's unfucking believable dude those people are butlers and it's like  i'm not gonna say her name on the air no no i have a roster though okay if you had a  fucking dinner party and your butler treated somebody like that you'd be like what are  you out of your fucking mind you work for me she probably has a great roster she's probably a good  policy no no don't don't hedge your bets now jimmy i don't care let's stay with the anger the  roster is um yeah she's uh let's see all right yeah i'm looking she's vice president of entertainment  for this one uh boom boom boom boom i don't see shit there is not

[03:31:00]  our last name well guess what fragrance well i mean that's that that supports something i didn't  want to say earlier before i had the information but it's like people that represent tons of reputable  people don't fucking act like that anybody that throws their weight around doesn't have  you've been in the business long enough to know how a publicist acts bill you know they call me  kid show biz where i come from everywhere that's what i heard everywhere everywhere i got a great 
[03:31:30]  youtube video do you yeah yeah we got it whenever we go to take a break i want to i got to show you  this we take a break it's we're done home time by the way is anybody on twitter mr got here  fucking five minutes before the show is exactly on twitter is he on twitter  oh uh that was the beginning of a trashing and i totally avoided it no i totally i'm sorry but i  apologize i'm not paying attention to that i'm very bad i'm sorry huh i wasn't gonna trash you  come on that's what you come in for what no it isn't what i come in for i'm saying it's what i love 
[03:32:00]  bill i love bill burr i'm not buying this he's setting me up for the overhand right i really do i find  you're very his name is uh it's uh z-a-c-h-a-r-y-l-e-v-i at twitter he's a cool guy don't  fuck with him but his publicist he was very cool and he's a good actor and you know i liked him a  lot but his publicist was really embarrassingly entitled and awful yeah he should know that maybe  he doesn't even know that she's awful yeah oh by the way i'm me and joe are going to have a 
[03:32:30]  little road trip driving down to dc uh we're going to be performing uh there uh tonight actually  yeah at the uh was it the listener i'm the worst listener auditorium the listener what is it it's  gonna be a listener there are you a bad plugger i am the one you know it is you know some people  can't we really just proved why i have i love my publicist after we're sitting here i'm agreeing  with you guys calling them chauffeurs in the back of my head i'm just feeling him going like really 
[03:33:00]  is this how this son of a bitch is that how he feels they're pushy by nature which they have to  be but there's a lot of my publicist never have that rude that's just rude man you you say you  threaten just to recap just to recap how did you feel about zachary levi's publicist just you know  just people got here late sum it up people got here late hmm it's how remember when de niro  enraging bull was being thrown in the jail cell the way he was speaking to those guards that's  how i wanted to talk to her yeah that's actually how she got in the fucking room she kind of he 
[03:33:30]  was actually politer going into that than she was getting in for roland oh what an atrocity you don't  know where you're going because you don't know your history you guys three times i've come here  roland has been wearing that same bruce springsteen t-shirt he is and i was gonna say i would not be  surprised if he owns three different ones like oh dude one of the greatest things i've ever seen  is when i did this i did this show for the troops and bruce springsteen was there and roland was a 
[03:34:00]  is a ridiculous likes springsteen more than you like acdc he was floating he couldn't even move  he was like paralyzed every time springsteen walked by it was fucking awesome to watch a man like him  have a dream come true you got a hug from him wow do you really like acdc i love acdc do you like them  they're great man yeah i think that they're they're very antiquated when it comes to their  online business they're really dumb when it comes to that but as far as a band they're kick-ass  they are you know what i i just i just saw the rush documentary that came out last year and i broke 
[03:34:30]  i put all my rushed the ones from the office from the 70s on my ipod and i've been going  fucking crazy oh god dude i haven't listened to them in so long yeah it's because it was a pain in the  ass like to just i never got into those guys you don't like the trees i there is unrest in the  forest there is trouble with the trees the maples want more sunlight all right but the yokes ignore  their pleas not one of the biggest hits i know but that's a good one two trees is a classic right 
[03:35:00]  song but but there is unrest in the forest it's no limelight is it really about trees come on  limelight did they uh they're the only band i've ever listened to that i still love even after i heard  this lyric who has come to slay the dragon they really are just nerds yeah nerds they're larpers  they talk about that in the uh in the documentary they talk about like after their fifth album they 
[03:35:30]  were like we decided after that album not to do any more 20 minute songs that went through five  parts about kingdoms and dragons like in renaissance fairs dragons are queers we get it they talk about  playing one of their 20 minute fantasy epics for ace freely and they go he just didn't get it  it talk about the culture clash yeah yeah like hey you know you like to fuck hookers and do blow 
[03:36:00]  ace listen to this 20 minute song about frodo baggins  you know i'm gonna try to cram in everything i wanted to talk about i was uh out in l.a right  and i turned my tv on and uh the show you got on here the girl there with the leopard boots  had uh wendy williams had uh rich brought richard simmons out and he comes out all right he's lost  like 30 pounds he's 61 years old you know you start to lose your elasticity so it's you actually look 
[03:36:30]  better if you stay fat when you're old and he comes out dude with those little candy stripe shorts  on and that tank top on with his hair plugs from like 1983 he could see through you see through his  hair it was fucking horrific and i was it just made me think of like you know people who you you  go into show business and some people are themselves and other people are a character so you have a  costume yeah like he might be at the top of the list you know michael jackson kept wearing the loafers  and the short pants and it starts to get embarrassing when you hit 50 he is 61 years old i think he might be 
[03:37:00]  at the top of the list with i was even thinking like like fucking angus to a certain level dude like that  guy when he's 60 dude to still be wearing the school boy outfit school boy outfit my vote goes  richard simmons with the little shorts and then the uh wife beater uh tank top oh and his i used to be  obese man tits 61 year old man tits peeking out the side and he didn't even have his fake tan he was a  fucking mess and you did like that hair was this sparse like shit somebody yesterday said it was like 
[03:37:30]  that little stuff that you throw in an easter basket yeah before you put the little chocolate  eggs on it richard simmons and gene wilder yeah the only two people that have that hair on the  fucking scene wilder tried to do a comb over with it oh man that's is there anything worse than old  fake straight hair gene wilder when he started flattening it down it's the whole world no that's  the funny thing about like uh when you get watch those hair plug commercials and somebody you always 
[03:38:00]  hear the guy go like yeah he goes i wish i did this 10 years ago it's like no you didn't if you  did no you didn't all you'd have had left with those plugs all your other hair would have been gone  and you'd have had no that's why all these people who get in plastic surgery they're heroes they're  letting them practice on their face like all those real housewives that you see what they're  fucked up that's because when we're 80 we're going to actually be able to look 20 because of what they  did to those people's doctor went and went okay i should have done this yeah did you ever 
[03:38:30]  did you ever hear that pat oswald joke that he did about uh when they were doing the celebrity  remember they were doing that show where they make you look like a celebrity through plastic  surgery how fucked up was that pat oswald permanent plastic yeah yeah yeah pat oswald had a joke  about it where he goes do you realize if they did this show 20 years ago he's like there'd be a guy  on the table and just as he was going under he'd go make me look like gutenberg  i don't even know who that is steve gutenberg oh steve gutenberg because we'd have dudes walking 
[03:39:00]  around looking like john oats yeah it really is kind of a time sensitive little uh project you're  going for there yeah that would suck who would you pick who's the timeless celebrity the one that you  could go paul newman newman brad pitt right cruz you couldn't go wrong right i don't know could you  jerry vale  who's the doctor who's the doctor in cannonball run that doctor
