<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts discussing their WNEW station colleagues, praising "Don and Mike" and commenting on "The Radio Chick" hiring their former associate, Chuck, who was unknowingly using Opie's "inappropriate bell" sound effect.  They humorously compared The Radio Chick's staff (Chuck, Butchie, and The Radio Chick) to *The Mod Squad*, even creating a fictional, sexually suggestive *Mod Squad 2000* promo.  They also discussed "Ron and Fez," focusing on Fez's vocal style, ultimately expressing overall positivity towards the station's programming.

Next, Leah Reich, a sex and relationships columnist for IGN4men.com, joined the show.  Callers and Leah engaged in explicit discussions about various sexual topics, including penis size, sexual positions, unusual odors, fetishes involving urination and defecation, and experiences with G-spot stimulation.  Leah recounted receiving many bizarre reader questions, and Opie shared an uncomfortable anecdote about a pregnant woman.  Mike Tyson then contributed bizarre and offensive comments to the conversation, offering violent "solutions" to callers' sexually explicit and violent problems. This continued with more caller questions and answers, remaining highly sexually explicit and vulgar throughout.

The show then shifted to teasing producer Rick about his wife's $600 purchase of seven pots and the questionable origin of his George Foreman grill, leading to a chaotic segment filled with jokes and accusations.

Following this, the hosts played a poorly produced audition tape from a staff member nicknamed Spaz or K-Dawg, filled with rambling, nonsensical statements. Spaz's audition included offensive commentary on Hillary Clinton (calling her a "carpet muncher"), the Million Youth March (using racial slurs), the giant mosquito incident in Queens, the Waco siege, and confused sports commentary.  Callers and the hosts reacted with disbelief, laughter, and outrage.  This segment also included further discussion of the giant mosquito, fueled by increasingly absurd caller contributions.

A bizarre phone call impersonating an Alzheimer's-stricken Ronald Reagan followed, filled with vulgar jokes and insults towards Nancy Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.  This was followed by a discussion about Bill Cosby's alleged inappropriate touching of a woman, leading to explicit conversation about sexual advances, with caller Jay Moore offering shockingly blunt advice on "getting laid."  Opie, Anthony, and callers engaged in this conversation extensively.

The show concluded with a tense yet ultimately seemingly reconciled segment involving a phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, triggered by Anthony's impression of him. The conversation devolved into insults, name-calling ("Jerkoff"), and arguments about the impression's nature.  Dice Clay, Kaz, Jay Moore (calling from LA), and other callers participated in this segment, expressing various reactions to the impression and engaging in further vulgar banter.  This was followed by a discussion regarding the Fox show "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?" and its contestant Rick Rockwell, focusing on allegations of abuse and featuring extremely vulgar and misogynistic commentary from Andrew Dice Clay, who repeatedly used the word "whore" and described violent scenarios. The hosts and callers shared similar disgust toward Rockwell and suggested other outrageous reality show concepts, repeatedly using "allegedly" throughout the discussion.  Audio clips of Rockwell were played, and the segment ended with more listener calls and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, your lowest common denominator, the worst of Opie and Anthony, is there anything sadder, the worst of Opie and Anthony, quick, change the channel, no, 1027, WNEW, Anthony, Don and Mike on at 7 o'clock, yes, I hope people are digging all the new shows that we have here at NEW, I listen on the way home now, I gotta be honest, I used to listen to  K-Rock on the way home, when we used to have the other guy there, I don't know, I forgot his name here, 7 o'clock, just one of the many that have come and gone, yeah, but I gotta tell you, Don and Mike, I find myself laughing on the way home and then I stop in front of the house, I don't get right out, I gotta sit there and wait until they're done with one of their bits or something, and I'd never do that, I swear, very funny, and what about the radio chick, she hired our buddy Chuck, yeah, you see that? 
[00:00:30]  Now Chuck used to do a lot of stuff for our show, very talented guy, you know, we just couldn't give him a ton of exposure, no, so we passed him on to the radio chick, cause he's a talented guy, that's the God's honest truth, and the radio chick hired him, yeah, I got an issue with Chuck right about now though, cause I was listening, cause I was driving in, alright, here it is, uh oh, little issue, okay, I gather up all my little toys at the end of the day, my little train whistle Opie, Celine, 
[00:01:00]  yeah, right, this one, the wacky thing, gym teacher, alright lady, wacky horn, I gather all those up, inappropriate bell, no, no, I don't gather that up, oh, okay, you know why, why, cause in the bag driving home, that's what I hear, sounds like I'm being chased by the good humor man, 
[00:01:30]  so I leave it here, okay, not thinking any other show is gonna be using the inappropriate bell, yeah, seems when I'm listening today, Chuck was slamming on the inappropriate bell during the show, uh oh, ripping me off, don't you, you leave the inappropriate bell alone, Chuck, you might have to hide it, you might have to bring it into the back office, that's what I'm thinking, but it's always here, you know, 
[00:02:00]  I don't think anybody would use it, but, uh, now, are they doing a radio show, or are they fighting crime?  I think they're fighting crime, what is that going on now? 
[00:02:30]  They got the radio chick, yeah, they got, uh, Chuck now, yeah, they got Butchie, yeah, it's not a radio show, it's the Mod Squad, it's the friggin' Mod Squad,  Chuck is Link, they got Radio Chick, played by Peggy Lipton, and then the other guy, I don't remember his name, Butchie, Mike, yeah, Michael, what was it, no, I know Butchie, but I don't know who the other guy was from the Mod Squad, 
[00:03:00]  see, they get done with the radio show, then they hit the streets of Manhattan fighting crime, it's amazing, butchie doesn't have the afro, though, well, no, no, Chuck would have to get the afro,  the Link from the Mod Squad afro, well, the white guy from the Mod Squad had a little white afro, I don't know, and a little bit, yeah, he had kind of a, kind of like the Mike Brady afro-ish thing happening, yeah,  Yeah, and then Peggy Lipton, you know, that, she was a piece of ass, and, uh, the radio chick, you know, she could, uh, fight crime with her boobs somehow, 
[00:03:30]  maybe that could be some kind of a superpower thing she, she has, but I'm thinking they're setting up to be crime fighters after they're done with the radio show,  they got all the makings from the Mod Squad on the, uh, the radio chick show, they really should do, like, a sweeper with the Mod Squad, like, music, you know,  They really should, yeah.  Join the radio chick, Chuck, and Butchie, for the radio chick show, and after the show, see them on the streets of Manhattan fighting crime as the Mod Squad 2000, 
[00:04:00]  A Quinn Martin production, in Technicolor, act one, the chick's boobs, foil a bank robbery, police bank, on Broadway, being robbed, out come the robbers, they get caught in the radio chick's boobs, 
[00:04:30]  Just then grabs them, and Butchie ties them up with one of the chick's bras, on the all-new, Mod Squad 2000, in Technicolor, a Quinn Martin production.  Wow, I would watch that.  Was that a Quinn Martin production?  Eh, it is now.  Every show from the 70s pretty much was, so I invented that.  Yeah, I think it was, Quinn Martin, that sounded like QM music, didn't it? 
[00:05:00]  Yes, it did.  Yeah, the Mod Squad, on before us.  Anal radio, then the Mod Squad.  That's what I'm calling them now.  They already just call themselves that now.  The Mod Squad.  Yeah.  From 10 to 2, the Mod Squad.  They've got to start their show tomorrow with that.  Yeah, they are the Mod Squad.  We'll be very flattered if they do. 
[00:05:30]  The Mod Squad.  What a politically correct radio show they've got over there.  All they need is a chink.  Who they figured out, and Yao Chung as Fing Lo.  Kind of like watching the 11 o'clock news.  Yeah.  They've got all their bases covered.  They've got all the bases covered.  You know, Chuck could do anything that might be offensive to blacks.  Yeah.  And then the chick, so any women's issues or anything like that.  I don't know, and the Butchie could take care of anybody.  Just need a gay guy.  Yeah, get a, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Gay guy.  Gay guy.  It's a regular melting pot, that show.  Gay Marco, soon to be joining the chick's show.  The Mod Squad.  It's the Mod Squad.  She should change the name of the show.  The Mod Squad.  They truly are the Mod Squad.  That's great.  They've got to make a promo where they're just running across a bridge, like the beginning of the Mod Squad.  Today's episode, Anal Intrusion. 
[00:06:30]  Remember that Peggy Lipton?  And I think she went out with Link for a while, too, didn't she?  And then she went out with, what's his name, the black music producer guy.  Oh, Quincy?  Quincy.  Yeah, she was married to him, I think.  Had a couple kids already?  She likes it.  She liked the dog meat.  Yeah.  A little jungle fever going on with Peggy Lipton.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Let's not forget Ron and Fez doing a very good job, too.  Well, maybe Fez join the, uh...  Why?  Come on.  Well, the voice, he has a little wacky voice.  It is a wacky Zane voice that he's got there.  A little wacky.  Why?  What do you mean, don't go there?  I like the show.  We listen every night.  I love the internet.  Why is everyone freaking out?  Everyone's freaking out.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Check out Ron and Fez.  Fez has just a little wacky voice, that's all.  Hey, Ron.  Hoo-hoo. 
[00:07:30]  What's on the internet tonight?  Hoo-hoo.  Don't you know?  Why?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting looks around here.  You can't say the guy has a wacky voice?  You know, for years we're sitting here, two years,  bashing every other show on this station  because they suck monkey ass.  Ass.  Thank you.  Now we finally are talking about the shows  and we enjoy the shows.  And we're just, you know, pointing out things  we've noted so far and you guys are losing it.  I mean, for God's sake. 
[00:08:00]  Don and Mike are great.  We love the mod squad that comes on before us.  And Ron and Ed Wynn are great.  Oh, Ron and Fez.  I'm sorry.  Come on.  What?  I'm the only one that thinks you have the wacky voice?  I was the one that said it.  The voice is a little wacky.  That's all.  It's, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh.  It's a little cat.  It's catchy. 
[00:08:30]  Right?  It is.  I'm sure.  What, Psycho-Lark?  You're not brave enough to say that on the radio?  What?  Making the hand gesture.  Look, look.  I had a cough.  I have no clue what anybody's deal is on that.  I haven't even met him face to face.  I hope he came in on their first night on the air, I guess.  They're nice guys.  I haven't met him.  They really are nice guys.  Because I, I, I don't know.  I listen to the show.  I enjoy it thoroughly.  No, it's, I'll tell you. 
[00:09:00]  You know what's weird about it?  Fez?  Yeah.  You meet him.  It's like, hey, yo, my name's Fez.  What's up?  How are you?  Oh, really?  And then on the air, he's like, oh, he's got a wacky voice.  Hoo-hoo!  All right.  We're back from commercial?  Yeah.  Okay.  How we doing?  Oh, Jimo.  What?  He sounds very happy.  Sounds very upbeat, very happy, very gay.  No.  That's all I'm saying.  No, we encourage you.  No, I meant that like in the Flintstones.  We'll have a gay old time. 
[00:09:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  That's all.  You know, when they said we'll have a gay old time on the Flintstones.  Right?  What?  Jesus Christ.  Hey!  Can't we just talk?  Hey!  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Okay.  Terrific.  Hey! 
[00:10:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey.  Okay, terrific.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  So, of course, we encourage everyone to check out what we're talking about.  You've got to check out the Mod Squad before us.  The Mod Squad.  Dynamike after us at 7, and Ron and Fez at, what, 11? 
[00:10:30]  They come on?  Yeah, 11 to 3.  And when do we get a morning show?  Today's episode, who's the new colored guy?  Why?  I'll ring my own bell.  Larry, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Real good.  Man, that show, it's a pretty good idea, the whole basis of the show.  Yeah.  But those guys sound like the two homos from In Living Color.  You know, the movie review?  What, men on radio? 
[00:11:00]  That's exactly what they sound like, the movie review homos from In Living Color.  Men on film?  Oh, God, they're terrible.  Anyone can comment on how anybody sounds or anything.  I enjoy the show.  Yeah, the basis for the show is a great idea.  I am very into the internet and computer.  I'm on all the time.  And to have a radio show where you can interact with who they're talking to and get on websites  they're talking to, it's very interesting.  It's very new.  I've never heard of anybody doing that on radio.  Joe, the other problem with that show is, though, dead air.  They have a lot of dead air. 
[00:11:30]  A lot of times in between.  They've only been on a week.  I'm not just saying this.  We like the show.  Yeah.  We're the first ones to trash a show after they've been on only two days.  No, we think all the shows are doing great.  All right.  You guys rock.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  Hey.  All right.  We love them. 
[00:12:30]  Great.  Finally have shows we can talk about.  That's the truth.  And have fun with it.  All we said was his voice was a little wacky.  That's all I said.  That's all?  A little different.  Come on.  And we love the Mod Squad.  Jay would fit right in.  Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Of course.  Hey.  All right.  We got to take a break.  No, but please check out all the shows and make your opinions after a while. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  You know?  At least give them all a chance.  They deserve it.  I'm working hard.  Loving the shows.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Okay.  Terrific.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of Okay Terrific.  That's the best.  I've heard that a thousand times.  It gets funnier every time you hear it.  I can see it now, Ant. 
[00:13:30]  Our next road show, we're going to see Okay Terrific.  Okay Terrific.  Signs in the audience.  Okay Terrific.  All right, we're back on our phone line.  Leah.  Hey.  Sorry, Leah, to make you wait there.  What's your last name?  My last name is Reich.  R-E-I-T-H.  Leah Reich.  Mm-hmm.  And your website is one of the most popular for guys on the Internet, right? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it is.  It's huge.  We are IGN, and we have entertainment.  Video games, sci-fi, movies, DVD, Babe of the Day.  Did you guys hear about Babe of the Century?  Babe of the Century, no.  Yeah, there was a huge voting thing for Babe of the Century.  That was us.  Elizabeth Hurley won.  Elizabeth Hurley?  Babe of the Century?  Babe of the Century, come on.  Hey, I didn't vote for her.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  I would go for the girl that's on the cover of Gear Magazine this month.  Yeah.  Jessica Biel?  The chick from what? 
[00:14:30]  The 17-year-old?  No, the 7-7 broad, right?  He's 17.  So?  So?  If she's showing it in a magazine, who cares?  That's one of the hottest photo spreads I've ever seen in my life.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't think it was that hot.  I've seen better, but...  Are you a lesbian, Leah?  Well, that's personal information, and I don't really give that out.  No.  That's yes.  Okay.  I mean, come on.  I'm worried about guys.  I've got to know a little bit about them.  Well, then you're bisexual.  That's okay, right? 
[00:15:00]  Hey.  All right, so you get a ton of hits.  A lot of guys go there for advice.  Yep.  And I'm sure you get a lot of weird questions.  I get the best questions on earth.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I get letters that start out with, no hello, no nothing, just, my penis itches all the time.  That was me.  I got a letter from a guy who's had this terrible crotch itch problem for three years, and he's  writing a letter to me.  He's like, now it's starting to have pus come out of it.  Do you think I should go to the doctor?  I'm just like, you know what? 
[00:15:30]  What do you think?  Ladies, man.  Does the guy shower?  Yeah.  He says, well, I keep it really clean, but it's just itching, and now it's turning a different  color, and there's pus coming out, and I'm like, three years, and you don't think  you should go to the doctor?  Right.  So, what did you tell the guy?  To go to the doctor?  Go to the doctor.  Take a shower, maybe?  Yes, the medication.  It wasn't signed by spaz, was it?  No.  Oh, okay.  No.  Just had a check.  No.  You probably would have used the pseudonym anyway, don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would have. 
[00:16:00]  Well, there was another guy who wrote, why is my ass hairy?  No, he wanted to know the best way to get rid of some of his ass hair.  He said, my ass is too hairy.  What can I do about it?  Ass hair.  Yeah, and I wrote, well, you know.  I guess he's not talking about, like, on the cheeks.  You know what?  I didn't really ask him to go into a lot more detail.  Visualization is something that I have to do a lot, and I didn't want to know where  it was, but I gave him some options for hair removal.  Being a girl, I'm familiar with most of them. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  You know, we have to keep ourselves sleek and smooth.  Uh-huh.  And so I told him a lot of different options, and then I went home, and one of my friends  living in San Francisco, there's a lot of people who shave themselves here, and...  San Francisco.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And...  Just trying to figure out your personal life.  Sorry.  He told me that I should have told the guy to use the Mach 3 razor.  It gets you the closest shave.  Yeah.  But, you know what?  Shaving your butt is really dangerous, because the hairs grow in all different directions,  and the only thing worse than a hairy ass is one with red bumps all over it. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  You don't want to ingrown hairs.  Do straight guys shave their ass?  Yeah.  I have a friend who's totally straight, and he shaves his chest.  Uh-huh.  And other parts of his body.  Totally straight, huh?  Yeah, I know he is.  Why bother with the ass, though?  Well, I mean, if you can't tell where the hair on your head begins and the hair on your  legs begins, don't you think...  I mean, hey, some women find it sexy.  Some men find it sexy, too.  What, hairy asses? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, hairy bodies.  No, hairy asses we're talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There are people who find a lot of body hair sexy, no matter where it is.  Yeah.  Honey, if there are men who find old women, like, and big, giant, pregnant women who want  porn about that, there are going to be people who find hairy ass sexy.  I checked out the pregnant porno sites.  Uh-huh.  And?  Well, I was, um...  You want to get into this a little bit?  I will, you know.  What do you think?  I was, uh...  I had a little fetish going.  Uh-huh.  We've discussed it on the radio show. 
[00:18:00]  You have a pregnant woman fetish?  I thought I did, Leah.  And then we had a girl come in here who was, what, eight months pregnant?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was huge.  And we had her dance for us and stuff, or for myself.  And I was completely turned off.  Yeah, it didn't last.  No, I got rid of that fetish quickly.  Which part turned you off?  I don't know.  It was just, it was just beyond bizarre.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, she was ready to drop, too.  We tried to have her give birth live on our show, but it didn't work.  Oh, that's quality radio. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Quality radio.  Award winning, mind you.  Yeah, we win awards all over the country now for stuff like that.  I can only imagine.  You're really pushing the envelope for women's rights.  We had her running up and down the stairs.  We had her have sex with her husband in another studio.  This was when she was, uh...  Did she get paid for this?  No, she was...  Actually, when she came in to give birth, she was past her due date.  So we had her doing jumping jacks, running up and down the stairs.  We wanted to induce labor here on the show.  Live on the show.  Then her husband banged her in another studio. 
[00:19:00]  Did you bang her?  Did you want...  Did you...  Are you horrified yet?  Did you actually want...  I'm totally not horrified.  How can I be horrified?  I work in an office with guys, and I get letters from kids who ask me how I can make their penises grow bigger.  I mean, what can...  There is nothing in the world, practically, that can horrify me.  How do you answer that one back?  Yeah, I need to know.  I say that this is actually another Psychic Friends Network, honey.  I don't know if your penis is going to grow.  You know?  And the thing is, is like most of those penis enlargement things, they're... 
[00:19:30]  I mean, some of them, if...  I mean, if something really honestly, truly worked, don't you think we'd all know about it?  Yeah.  If something was really worked and didn't have scary side effects or didn't have all kinds of possible things that could go wrong  and weird things that can happen, and if it was really permanent, we'd know about it.  I mean, there are pumps and there are creams and there are this and there are that.  The cream.  Why doesn't the cream make your hands bigger?  Exactly.  Remember that old gag?  I mean, do you really want to attach weights to your penis every day to try and stretch it out? 
[00:20:00]  I do.  I bet you do.  I bet you have them on right now.  Yeah.  I do.  It's stretching out.  Yeah.  I'm glad to my knees.  Yeah, I don't understand.  I'm glad to my knees.  Yeah.  Does that work, though?  It's apparently worked for some people, but I think you've got to have a lot of patience and definitely a little pain tolerance.  Yeah.  And you've had a lot of strange letters lately?  Yeah, I've had some good ones lately.  Well, I get them from all different ages. 
[00:20:30]  You know, they all want to know so many possible things, not just about, I have a column called What's Up With My Penis, which answers more the medical stuff.  I don't actually answer those regularly, but, you know, I get them all.  In your little letter here that we received, what's that bump on my penis?  Uh-huh.  Can too much masturbation stump my growth?  Yep.  Will she go out with a geek like me? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  I get guys of all ages who are convinced.  I get guys who have never gone on dates.  Uh-huh.  And I'm not talking about just 14-year-olds.  I get guys of all ages.  Earl Fugler.  Our own black girl here at the studio.  Yeah.  I get all the questions.  I get guys who are 32 and newly divorced and have no idea how to start dating again.  Yeah.  I get guys who, I got the best one.  Can I read you the best one ever?  Of course you can.  I'll read you a couple.  This one, I don't know how old this kid is, but you've got to tell me the best part. 
[00:21:30]  Leah, my girlfriend and I have our two-month anniversary coming up, and she said I could suck her breasts.  But then it hit me.  Do I actually suck on her breasts or on her nipples?  You don't have to answer, but I could use some help.  It's like funny.  Yeah, that's got to be a kid.  The best thing.  That's a 15-year-old.  I know.  The best thing in the world, though, is the fact that his girlfriend is like, sweetie, I want to talk to you about something.  There's a special occasion coming up.  Yeah.  And I've got a good surprise for you.  Yeah.  Hey, that's wrong.  Has a girl ever said that to you?  No, I... 
[00:22:00]  Suck my boobies.  I loved when she said that.  That would be hysterical.  Suck her boobies.  All right.  Read another one for us.  Um, and I'll have any of the older ones, because, oh, you guys will like this one.  You can give the advice to this guy.  Okay.  Dear Leah, hi, I am a younger teen, and I have a few questions.  I wanted to ask you if it is normal when I see two women kissing, not like kissing on the cheek, but kissing like lesbian kissing, my penis goes straight up.  I wanted to know if it is normal.  We might have to clean that up for the radio. 
[00:22:30]  His, his, uh, his junk, uh, gets, uh...  You can't say penis?  I don't know what they dump out of on the show.  That sounds good.  It's very clinical now.  All right.  Yeah, she's an advice columnist.  We can get away with a lot more than we usually do.  Yeah, and he said, um, uh, I wanted to know if it is normal to be aroused a lot.  Right.  Yeah.  But, um, yeah, I get, I get a lot of, a lot of questions about the penis.  Um, guys who have different questions.  They don't know.  I get, I got so many questions about average penis size that I had to go ahead and write a whole article about it. 
[00:23:00]  And what, what do you think's average?  What do I think the average?  Yeah.  As far as I know, average penis size is 6.4 inches in length and 5 inches in circumference.  Rock.  5 in circumference?  I like how it suddenly gets really quiet as everyone starts.  Wait, 5 in circumference?  I'm trying to...  Yeah, if your, if your penis is 2.5 inches in...  That's not diameter, okay.  It's not a tuna can.  I like...  It's like a big Foster's oil can.  I know, I was looking at the Foster's, uh, beer can on the other side of the studio. 
[00:23:30]  And I get, I get a lot of good questions from guys who have girlfriends who have never had orgasms,  and they don't know how to help their girlfriend have an orgasm, or guys who want to last longer.  Yeah.  Um, those are all really good ones.  Because those are, those are pretty easy.  Well, Leah, you want us to put you through the test?  You want to answer a few questions from our, our lovely audience?  Oh, I can give it a shot.  Is there anybody who wants to ask me a question?  I don't really answer, I can't give medical advice out.  Right.  Um, so no penis questions.  But if you've got any relationship or sex questions, we can give it a shot. 
[00:24:00]  Or, I mean, there could be, uh, some things you can answer about the penis.  Like what?  I don't know.  We'll, we'll go to the phones next, and we'll find out, okay?  Okay.  Give out the website.  We've got to take a break, and then we'll take some, uh, some questions from our audience.  It's www.IGN4men.com, and you spell out the four, so it's I-G-N-F-O-R-M-E-N.com.  All right.  Very good.  More with Leah next.  Stay there.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  107 WNEW. 
[00:24:30]  And we're back.  We're talking to Leah.  Hey.  Hey, Leah.  What's going on?  She's got this great website.  A lot of guys go to it, and they, they ask her, uh, advice on sex and relationships and  stuff, right?  That's right.  Very popular website.  It's, uh, I-G-N-F-O-R-M-E-N.com.  I-G-N-F-O-R-M-E-N.com.  And you get a lot of funny, funny questions.  I get a lot of funny ones.  I get a lot of serious ones.  I get them all.  And a lot of people, uh, they write to this stuff, and you think they're joking, but they're 
[00:25:00]  not.  Some of them, I wonder.  They're pretty clueless, right?  Yeah.  Well, we're going to put you to the test.  We've got a bunch of guys on the line that want to ask you some advice, okay?  Okay.  Try it.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Uh-oh.  Your phone's crapping out.  We've got Leah on the phone.  You've got some advice that you need?  Yeah.  I think I found my girlfriend's G-spot, and I was wondering if she could recommend any sexual  positions that might help us utilize it. 
[00:25:30]  Well, that's kind of a trial and error kind of a thing.  I mean, everybody's G-spot.  Generally, the G-spot is around in the same area, inside.  So you're going to have to experiment, because there are some positions that are going to  feel good and some that aren't.  I mean, if I were you, a lot of good G-spot is manual stimulation.  You can do a lot with that, with your hand, if you can find it with your hand.  That's what works best, is if I use my finger.  Well, you know what, there are some positions that are going to be good, but some of them  are just acrobatic, uncomfortable. 
[00:26:00]  While you're trying to find the G-spot, you're like, throwing out your back, and what's the  point of that?  Right.  I mean, basically, you know what, if you guys can find your G-spot, God, you're lucky,  because most people can.  Well, what...  Just do what feels good, and don't even worry, you know, to try different things.  Totally awesome.  I can tell when I hit it.  Yeah.  What sexual position do you suggest there, Leah?  Like the wheelbarrow position, have her walk around the room as you're holding her legs  or something?  Is that going to feel good?  I don't think that's a good one.  I don't think that's a good one.  Yeah, that's a really relaxing sexual position.  You know what, there are some that are good, like if, you know, she's lying down and you're 
[00:26:30]  standing up, and kind of tilted up, that might work.  You know what, honestly, the best thing is, all that Cosmo, these are great sexual position  things, it's basically a matter of kind of experimenting around and figuring out what  feels good.  Some women really like when you're in a chair, and you're sitting on, they sit on your lap,  either facing forwards or back.  Right.  That's always a popular one.  That's what you like, right?  This is so not about me. 
[00:27:00]  This is about Tim and his G-spot girlfriend.  I just want to know your credentials.  Like, have you seen a lot of, you know, are you like an expert?  I can't give you my references, but I know a few things.  Yeah?  Through experience?  Oh, wait.  Hey, I thought we were giving advice here.  Yeah, we are, but I just want to know a little about you.  I've had my experience.  Leah, who's giving the advice.  Just the right amount.  Leah, have you ever seen a penis?  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  Yeah, I've definitely seen a penis.  All right, good.  All right, so you suggest those positions for Tim to start with?  I think those positions would be really good.  But you know what the reality is, is that the angle, it also depends on the angle of  your penis, the angle of the vagina, all those kinds of different things.  Very good.  You could, you could.  If I were you, I would just roll around, get sweaty, and try everything you possibly  want to try.  And see what happens.  Oh, yeah, what the hell?  You can put that trigonometry, that's a good use.  Angle.  There you go.  Try to figure it all out.  Thank you, Tim.  Let's go to Dominic. 
[00:28:00]  Dominic, you're next.  What's going on?  Hello?  You're talking to Leah.  Hi, Dominic.  I got my schween caught in a junk drawer.  All right.  Wait, what?  You got your schween stuck where, Dominic?  In the junk drawer.  How ironic is that?  I was very, very injured.  All right, obviously somebody just having a little fun.  Hmm.  Somebody is a happy hour there already?  I was walking in the dark kitchen, and it got caught in the drawer, and now it's got 
[00:28:30]  bent.  You get it?  Junk drawer.  You know, his junk got caught in a junk drawer.  How can I fix it?  Leah, you got questions about that?  Guys getting their stuff stuck in places?  No, I sure don't.  Usually things don't get stuck that easily.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  You know, I can't imagine that happening.  God, that would be so...  Can you imagine going to the emergency room in that position?  I'm sure there have been more embarrassing positions people have gone to the ER in.  Yeah.  Tony, you're next.  Things up their butt. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, Tony.  Yo.  What's up?  You're on with Leah.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, Tony?  You're on the rule.  Good.  Hey, I was wondering, how can I, how can I put this, get my girlfriend off without having  to go south of the border for more than 15, 20 minutes?  Why?  You don't like that?  Is she...  I don't like it.  It's just kind of...  Your jaw gets tired.  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  No, totally.  Hey, girls have the same problem.  If I were you, basically one of the good things to do is, I mean, no women can, not every woman 
[00:29:30]  can have a really fast orgasm.  Some can, some can't.  She might want to work on it a little bit on her own and try and figure out what positions  there might be something that would work a little bit better.  You might, there might be a position for her to sit in that might help her, you know, have  an orgasm more quickly.  Another thing to do is start out with something other than oral sex.  You can start out with manual stimulation.  You can roll around.  You can introduce, you know, you can introduce vibrators if you want. 
[00:30:00]  They introduce the gardener.  That'd probably be even faster.  The what?  Oh, the gardener.  They're rotten.  I bet that'd be a fast one.  Yeah.  You can bring the milkman in.  Yeah.  There's different, the vagina has different angles also.  I've never heard of that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're all different shapes.  That's why, you know how sometimes you fit better in some people and not in others?  Well, I want to.  It's not necessarily because they're stretched out.  It's also because they're different shapes and sizes.  Different shapes and angles and stuff.  It's like Space Mountain in there. 
[00:30:30]  Pitch black and going all kinds of ways.  Oh, yeah.  I once dated a girl.  Uh-huh?  I hit the back wall, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, it's brutal.  You can totally hit the cervix.  And you know what?  It hurts when the cervix gets, the cervix is sensitive.  Yeah.  When you smack into that, it's like, forget it.  All right.  Game over.  All right.  Game over.  Let's move on to Matt.  Matt's got a very good question for Leah.  Matt.  What's up, Oak?  All right.  You talking to Leah?  She gives you a nice comment.  I got a problem with my girl.  Yeah.  Every time I'm going for the back door, she's all open to it. 
[00:31:00]  She loves it.  I'm fiddling around.  She's digging it, you know?  Yep.  But once I get my junk all the way, you know, doing its thing, she's got to go to the bathroom.  She's got to take a dumb.  So what am I supposed to do?  Let her take a dumb.  Yeah.  Let her go.  Then she goes and sits down and she don't have to go.  Yeah.  That's because, I mean, you're basically, you're stimulating all kinds of stuff.  It's, you know, you know when you have to go to the bathroom really badly because there's  something sitting in there?  Yeah.  That's my thing.  The body thinks that I have to do that. 
[00:31:30]  When something sitting in there is Matt.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  The only, you know, the only way that, it might just be the way she is.  She might not be able to.  She might, she might have to try and.  I think I just got to get her to like bite out on the pillow and deal with it.  Yeah, it might be that.  Seriously.  Leah, in a matter of time, this show is going to be all over the world.  Can you, can you imagine?  I, I, how I fear.  The state of the universe.  It's like gonorrhea.  All right.  Who do we have next on the line here?  Renee.  Renee, you got a question for Leah.  Yeah, listen, I'm dating this girl and she's got an odor down there. 
[00:32:00]  Uh-huh.  No?  And I really don't know how to tell this girl.  I mean, she's, she's good looking.  She's hot.  I don't, you know, I'd be with this girl.  Honey, sexy does not have anything to do with personal hygiene or body odor.  But it does help you get over it.  But it's not body odor.  No, I know.  No, I'm talking about different bodily odors.  Well, it could be a number of things.  It could be hygiene.  It could be something.  It could be an infection.  I'm not talking necessarily about an STD.  It could be something like a yeast infection. 
[00:32:30]  She doesn't work at the Bumblebee factory.  Does she, Renee?  Hey.  This is what I don't understand.  This is the bad part because I've been with her.  I was with her once.  Uh-huh.  And it was a long order filled up the whole room.  Okay.  You either, you either, you either, look.  Okay.  This is my motto.  If you're close enough to do it, you're close enough to talk about it.  And if you can't say something to her about it, then you probably should find a reason  to not go out with her anymore.  Pop in a Mentos.  Well, that's the whole thing.  I'm still hanging out with her, but I don't want to go down there.  Well, then you have to say something about it because you're going to have to go down  there eventually. 
[00:33:00]  That's my problem.  How the hell do I say something?  Say, you know what?  I don't know what this is.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever had to do in my life.  I feel super uncomfortable and stupid, but there's, you know, or you could say, hey,  once before I had this girlfriend and she had this odor and it was a yeast infection  and I'm thinking that, you know, that's something that I've noticed.  It's not bad and it's not like there's something wrong.  I really want to go down on you, but there's this problem and, you know, I wanted you to  talk to me about it. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know what it could be.  Are you explaining to this guy or talking to me right now?  I'm talking to him.  Oh, okay.  I'm telling him what he should say.  Oh, you're giving me an offer.  Hey, Rene, Rene, I got some advice for you.  It's a, it's a, I was in a very similar situation.  You got to dump the bitch, man.  You got to.  Get away.  And you know what?  You'll, you'll solve two problems.  You'll get rid of your bad breath too.  Oh, Jesus.  Yo, I can't go down.  I haven't went down there like that.  I'm not doing that.  You know what you do?  Subtle hints sometimes work.  A snorkel and a mask. 
[00:34:00]  Stuff like that.  It'll work.  Oh, good.  All right.  Well, the question.  You can stick an air fresher down there.  You know, the comments.  Yeah.  Like peel off back.  A stick-up.  This is a good place for a stick-up.  My name is pretty unique.  You know, I'm hoping she hears this phone call.  So I'm talking about her.  Get a can of Lysol.  You better hope she's not listening to the radio right now.  All right.  Thanks, Rene.  Thanks a lot.  The questions are getting better, Leah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, let's go to Joe.  Joe's got a very serious question here.  All right.  Joe.  Hello.  You need some advice from Leah, huh?  Joe. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys can just break my chops all you want.  This is one of the things where being hung like this is actually not a good thing.  All right.  So you got a big one?  Yeah.  My wife is kind of tiny.  She's, you know, she's with the gymnast and dancing.  She's kind of tiny.  I'm a big guy, you know?  Yeah.  Leah, he's hung.  I think I've caught on to that point.  Yeah.  So what's the advice for Joe?  It hurts him when we do it, you know?  I mean, oral sex all the time is great, but, you know, normal sex is kind of cool every 
[00:35:00]  now and then, you know what I'm saying?  We can't because I hurt her.  And you guys got married?  Yeah.  We got a kid, too.  Wow.  Wow.  How'd you do that?  Kid got dense in his head?  Carefully, carefully.  Very carefully.  That's a toughie.  You know, I'm sure you've tried lubricant and all that kind of stuff, right?  Tell me to be 40.  You know, you're 40.  You guys are so bad.  Tell me to be 40-inch.  What?  I can't believe I'm listening to you.  Hey, Joe.  Me the can win.  Yeah.  Joe, I got some advice for you. 
[00:35:30]  What's that?  Yeah, you take over.  Get a shoehorn.  Come on.  Has she talked to the doctor about it at all?  Has she talked to her gynecologist about it?  No, she's went to the doctor a couple times about it, and it's just, it's me.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if there's anything you can do.  I mean, she just might be, you could, I mean, she's had a kid.  If the kid can fit through it, you can fit through it, but it might not feel good.  It's not bad.  I hit things.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You hit things.  Yeah, that is the worst feeling.  Well, we'll have to forget about it. 
[00:36:00]  You might just, you know what?  I don't know what to tell you on that.  You might just have to be really careful and have, you know, kind of mix things up a little  bit.  Do a little bit of regular sex and then finish off with oral sex.  You know, you could start out with, because you know when you get to finishing when you're  having regular sex and you start going haywire, going all the way in as far as you  can?  You know, taking it home.  Joe, get the jaws of life.  That's the thing.  It's like, that's when you really start hitting things, but maybe you can do a little bit,  you know, a little bit of regular sex, enjoy it, get warmed up, finish it off with oral 
[00:36:30]  sex.  All right.  Like, oral sex isn't regular sex.  You know what I'm saying.  Very good.  You know what?  All right.  Kind of mix it up a little bit, because I don't know that there's much you can do.  You know, Joe, I think that's a great question.  Thanks for calling today.  Thanks.  You know what I think he's got to do?  Remember when the kid at school used to hold the pencil way down by the tip?  And the teacher would put the rubber band on the pencil and say, don't go below the  rubber band?  Yeah.  He's got to put like a rubber band around his member and just go that far. 
[00:37:00]  Like a big bumper.  Or maybe like those cones they put around the dog's head so they don't chew themselves when  they get back from the vet.  He could put that halfway down and he won't hurt him.  I'm just trying to help.  All right.  Rob, you've got a question for Leah.  She's giving out some advice today to our faithful listeners here.  Rob.  How do I get my chick to give me a blumpkin?  What the hell is...  Leah, do you know what a blumpkin is?  You know what?  No, I have no idea.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Rob, what's a blumpkin?  Be careful in your explanation.  Be careful and explain what a blumpkin is to Leah.  I got it.  It's when you're taking a d**k and a chick giving you a hummer.  Oh, okay.  You're on the commode.  You're on the ball.  That's good.  That's a lady.  That's a lady you got there, Rob.  You're sitting on the can and she's giving you a hummer.  Is she feeding you two at the same time?  Are you drinking a beer at the same time? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  That's the kind of memory, huh?  Are you resting your beer on her head at the same time?  Yeah, really.  In a crack pipe, bitch.  What did he say?  In a crack pipe, bitch.  I don't know.  Leah, angry man.  Leah, I think you pissed off one of our listeners there.  Oh, yeah.  Leah did it.  I'm sure you've never done that.  No, no.  They're all our friends.  Tommy, you got a question for Leah?  Giving some great advice today to the men.  I learned what a blumpkin is.  Tommy.  Hi.  Hi, Tommy.  Hello, Leah.  Only serious questions at this point. 
[00:38:30]  No doubt.  Okay, Tommy.  I've stayed a lot of very attractive model types, but I like to be urinated and defecated  on.  Is that something...  Hey, who doesn't?  Hey.  No.  Is that something?  What?  I couldn't hear you because the rude boys were getting ruptured.  Me, me, me.  Me, me, me.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  What?  What?  She didn't hear you again.  Go ahead.  I...  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  What?  Is it normal?  Is it normal?  Is it normal?  I'm not...  I'm not going to say what's normal or not normal.  Everybody's got their fetishes.  Everybody's got their things.  Oh, come on.  That's out there. 
[00:39:00]  Come on.  Well, you know...  Hey, you know what?  I live in San Francisco.  Ain't nothing out there as far as I'm concerned.  The guy...  You know what?  What you're going to have to do to find somebody like that is you're going to have to start  going either to clubs, specializing, putting out personal ads.  There are people who get off on that.  There are people who get off on doing it.  I think Stallone...  And they're out there.  Stallone likes it.  What?  Stallone likes it.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Sure he does.  So do you suggest Tommy starts off slow, maybe, or...?  I think...  Yeah, I think what you're going to have to do is you're not going to...  I don't think you're just going to find, you know, Jane Average walking around the street 
[00:39:30]  and say, hey, lady, can you take a c*** on me?  But I think if you...  You can put personals in, and there are definitely organizations of people who are completely open  to all sorts of those activities, and you're just going to have to search those out.  Yeah, you've got to start off...  Dude, start off slow with a little hugging, kissing, maybe her blowing a snot rocket on your  cheek.  You know?  You're sick.  You can.  Yeah, we're sick, Tommy.  Remove the plumbing and go down to the basement when she goes to the bathroom. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, remove the end cap.  I'm going to clean out the pipe.  You guys are sick.  All right, thank you.  Bye, peace.  Jesus, man.  These people.  That's hot, Bob.  You ever...  You into that at all?  Into...  Defecation?  I can say, I don't care about personal information.  No, that really is not my thing.  Yeah.  So you're from San Francisco?  So your girlfriend doesn't take a...  I'm not from here.  I'm not from here.  You live there?  I've been here for a while.  So are you straight or, you know, a lesbian girl?  But didn't we already cover this?  I just want to make sure. 
[00:40:30]  You just want to make sure.  Well, you know what?  If we ever hang out in person, then maybe I'll tell you.  All right.  Dave, what's going on?  Lesba.  Oh, man, you guys rock.  All right.  Only serious questions at this point for Lee.  Yeah, of course, of course.  Okay.  Listen, I got a question for the young lady, right?  When my girl and I are doing things, it seems like, you know, she has a problem bouncing  on me.  Bouncing on you?  Yeah, you know how, like, ride me, so to speak?  Like, if I'm, like, in my horizontal position and stuff like that, she really doesn't like 
[00:41:00]  to get on top.  But I love that, man.  Oh, getting on top.  I don't like to get on top.  There's a woman out there who doesn't like to get on top?  Yeah, what, are you kidding me?  This chick will get, like, she'll give me, like, maybe, like, two or three bounces.  And then after that, whew, I'm tired.  Can you get back on top?  Have you ever sat down with her and said, you know, baby, you know what really turns me on  more than anything is when you get on top?  Have you ever told her that?  What day don't I do that?  Huh?  I said, what day don't I do that?  I do that, like, every night.  Okay, well, I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, no, seriously, there are guys who will go, why won't my girlfriend do this because  it really turns me on?  And I'll say, have you ever asked her to do it?  And they'll be like, no, it's not like girls are psychic.  That's why I asked you that.  Aaliyah.  Yeah, Dave, I think I can help you out.  I don't even want to know what you have to say.  I hope he's going to feel this one.  You want her bouncing a lot more when she's on top, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's the best, man.  All right, glue your credit cards to the ceiling.  I mean, that'll get her reaching and bouncing. 
[00:42:00]  Seriously, because even like, you know, we're doing things like that.  I mean, like, you know, she's trying to, like, lay off of it when I'm trying to.  Now, like you told the other guy a little while ago saying, like, how you might be hurting  things and stuff like that.  Yeah.  And I don't know if that's the case, but I've asked her several times.  She says no.  She says she's uncomfortable.  Maybe she's not comfortable.  Maybe it doesn't do it for her.  But maybe you can say, look, I'll make you a trade.  You do this, and I'll do something that you want for as long as you want it.  A trade?  Yeah, what the hell?  Yeah, I'm with you.  A trade.  Yeah.  Say, like, you know, like, I'll, I don't know, you can trade sexual favors. 
[00:42:30]  Haven't you ever done that?  Oh, man, let's make a deal here.  Yeah, really.  No, but you can be like, you know what, I want to treat you.  Like, one night, you know, I want to make all these great decisions.  I want to be, I want to have all these things.  So, will you do this for me, please?  Will you get up on top and stay there for a while?  Yeah.  All right.  Please, for me, because it would make me really happy.  And I want to make you happy, so I want to make you happy in retirement.  All right.  Well, he's saying she gets tired.  Well, go to work out and get some more stamina or something. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  But, Dave, thanks for your question.  We only have a few more minutes here.  We want to get a few more questions.  All right.  You guys, sir.  Thank you.  Very good question from Dave.  Let's go to Steve.  Only serious questions at this point for Leah.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Now you've got a serious question, right?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  It refers to, like, you know, when you're going to take care of the woman, you know, go downstairs, go south.  Yeah.  What is the closest thing you guys can tell me that would be safe as far as, like, what the smell should be like? 
[00:43:30]  Have you ever been asked that question before?  You know, I've never, ever been asked that question before.  Everyone's kind of different.  What is it supposed to smell?  I mean, it's not supposed to smell super fishy.  Okay.  If you're smelling tuna, there's something wrong.  Oh.  All right.  No, there really is, because there's infections that have a very strong fishy smell.  Okay.  And there are STDs that have a very strong fishy go to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I don't, you know, the smell, everybody's kind of different. 
[00:44:00]  I like the smell of a hooker that hasn't showered in two weeks.  No, I mean, like, you know, sometimes it's clean.  Sometimes it's kind of like, you know?  Yeah.  Leah, he's asking what should it smell like.  Off the top of your head.  Off the top of my head.  I don't, that's, that's the thing, is it doesn't, it doesn't smell like anything else.  Yeah.  It should smell kind of clean, but the thing is, is the thing, the other problem is, is  that at different times of the month, I'm not talking about going down on a girl when 
[00:44:30]  she's got a period.  I'm talking about.  Oh, stop.  Yeah.  No, gross you out.  No, no, I'm getting hot.  Yeah, I'm going to get it pregnant.  Leah, let me ask you, you know.  I like looking at my guy just.  During different times of the month, it smells different.  During different parts of her cycle, it feels different, and it smells different, and it  looks different during different parts of her cycle.  Now, now, should it also be sometimes thick or thin?  No, seriously, it changes throughout the month, during different parts of the month, depending  on whether she's, you know, ovulating, whether she's, what part of her cycle she's in. 
[00:45:00]  Sometimes it'll be thicker.  Sometimes, it shouldn't be chunky.  What if it starts looking like the grill of an edsel?  It should not be chunky.  It should not look like cheese.  It should not look like cheese.  That's a good rule of thumb.  Like cottage cheese.  That's disgusting.  All right.  Cottage cheese.  Do you like how I can sew gross guys out?  It's the best thing in the world.  Yeah.  I bet we could gross you out a lot easier.  Well, we got it.  No way.  We got to thank Steve for the question.  Thanks, Steve.  Leah, taking advice from our listeners, only serious questions, of course. 
[00:45:30]  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, you're next on the radio show.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Sorry, I had some in my throat.  What's up, Jeff?  I was wondering if you could catch STDs from receiving the rusty trombone.  Ah.  You know what the rusty trombone is?  Um, no.  Why don't you guys tell me?  That's a good one.  Well, that's when a girl is taking care of your back door and doing the reach around,  and it looks like she's playing a trombone.  Can you receive an STD from that?  Well, so it's basically she's giving you a rim job?  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[00:46:00]  A rim job.  Sure.  A rim job.  And she's also a rim slash hand.  Okay.  Whoa, visualization.  It's the trombone.  Yeah, I got it.  You know, I, not being a doctor, I can't guarantee that you wouldn't, but I can't imagine you would  unless you both had some, unless you had a cut on the back door.  You know, some, you need to have really small cuts.  Oh, cut.  On the back door.  Like a small cut.  Oh, okay.  That's what I said. 
[00:46:30]  If you see going on, if you had a, uh, any kind of problem, you know, back, if you had  any sort of infection, I mean, you might be able to, because, you know, something like  herpes, while it's hard to, depending on which one it is, you might be able to transfer it.  I mean, there's a possibility.  Yeah.  Depending on what she's got and what you've got in me, she'll always get tested.  But there are things you can't get tested for.  And if she's got an open four on her mouth, um, I should not.  Oh, she should not be back there.  No, no.  All right.  That's a very good question from Jeff. 
[00:47:00]  Uh, let's go to George real fast.  George, you got a question for Leah?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Hi, George.  Um, Leah, how you doing, Leah?  Fine, thanks.  Good.  Uh, I have a, I have a weird fetish, I think.  Mm-hmm.  Um, I like to, uh, be thrown up on.  Like, I like to eat it and everything.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I was just, I was just wondering, uh, how I could convince my girlfriend to do  that.  It's going to make you puke.  How you could convince your girlfriend to do that? 
[00:47:30]  Does she know you have this fetish?  Well, um, I'm a little afraid to tell her because, I mean.  Yeah, that.  I don't know if it's normal or not.  How?  It's, well.  Um.  My last girlfriend used to do it to me, but.  How does your girlfriend, I mean, how does your girlfriend, as far as other fetishes  and kinky stuff go?  Uh.  I mean, is she totally vanilla?  Is she totally, like, missionary position, honey, turn the light off, put your nightgown  back on?  What, the new girl?  The new girl.  What does she like?  She, uh, she likes it when I suck her toes.  Okay, well, see, that's not really that. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, that is.  But have you ever talked to her about any kind of, can you toss, you know what you're going  to have to do is you're going to have to feel around the subject.  Okay.  You're going to have to say, you know, talk to her about different kinds of fetishes  and different kinds of stuff and find out what she's interested in and slowly introduce  the subject.  I don't think, like, next time you take her out to dinner, you can be like, hey, honey,  pass this salt and you puke on me when we're done.  George, does she have a gag reflex?  Um.  Oh, you know, you're, don't go, don't go there.  What?  I'm just asking.  Yeah, she's got a gag reflex. 
[00:48:30]  Where are you going?  When are you getting a Hummer?  Yeah.  Just drive that baby home.  Oh, God.  And you'll get her puking.  Yeah.  You know what?  You're going to have to talk about it.  You're going to have to introduce it to Farley.  And if she's, like, super against any kind of kink or fetish, chances are she's not going  to be up for puking.  George, think about the gag reflex or go out and date a bulimic.  Yeah.  A bulimic.  Yeah.  They like throwing up all the time.  Hey, guys.  Take her out to a nice dinner.  Yeah.  And then punch her hard in the stomach. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  Thank you, George.  Hey, long-time listener, first-time caller.  Appreciate it.  Indication.  All right.  Absolutely.  Punch her very hard in the uterus.  Aaliyah?  Yeah, on a puke.  Yes, darling.  We have Mike Tyson checking in.  I apologize.  Aaliyah?  I have a question.  Uh-huh.  I used to have this problem with Robin Givens when I was married to her.  The bitch couldn't take a punch.  Where is the best place to punch a bitch where I could have sex with her, yet she would not 
[00:49:30]  file charges of rape against me?  Am I listening to this?  Am I so not involved in this?  I don't think it's just like...  In the goddamn uterus?  Is that where you punch?  Or in the...  Because she had a glass drawer.  I punch her and she go out like a light.  That is the worst thing I've ever heard, ever.  Yeah?  Why is it that you can say goddamn, but you can't say the F word?  Why is it that you can have a woman talk about getting...  Totally getting off, and you can't say the F word? 
[00:50:00]  Hey, goddamn f*** yourself.  Damn, I said it.  And hope it dumped out of me.  Damn, I just said the F word.  Oh, God.  All right, let's go back to our calls.  There's a few...  Yeah, why don't we do that?  There's a few good ones left here.  Yeah, you keep talking like that, and Mike Tyson, come over there and take care of you, Leah.  Why don't we play once in Leah's pants?  Oh, God.  You ever play that game?  You take the phone and rub it on your genitalia, and we have to guess if it's a mohawk, a diamond, a triangle... 
[00:50:30]  Or completely shamed.  Or completely shamed.  I'm so not going there.  Something's telling me you're a rainforest.  Mike Tyson's feeling like it's Abraham Lincoln's head in the leg lock.  Oh, man.  I apologize.  I gotta apologize for Mike Tyson.  Mike just kind of checks in from time to time.  He screw you two homos, I'll punch yous out, too.  See, we can't even control him.  Mike, you're next.  You got a serious question for Leah.  She's getting a little annoyed at this point.  Yes, go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, I got a question. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  Go for it.  Leah, this is a good one.  Okay.  I need a good answer.  Well, I only get the answer.  She's getting some time from me, right?  She's, you know, riding me.  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, she gets that sound, that fart sound.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It feels so good, but it sounds so bad.  This is true.  There is nothing.  You can do nothing.  I mean, I tried pulling the buttocks apart to let air out.  It don't work.  Honey, it's not coming from there. 
[00:51:30]  It's not coming from there.  Where's it coming from?  It's coming from there's air trapped inside the vagina.  When you're in there, like, you're causing friction.  There's movement.  There's air going in and out.  Sometimes air gets trapped, and that's what it is.  It's not coming from the back door.  Like, if I took a finger in there, would it let air out?  No, there's honestly, there's, I mean, sometimes you can feel it, and you might be able to tell it's going to happen.  She might know.  You might be able to keep it from happening and slow it down.  But you can't.  I and Mike has a solution. 
[00:52:00]  I don't want to hear what he's going to say.  A couple of body blows to the lower abdomen, and then flip her over with some kidney punches.  That ought to drain all the air out.  And if she's still doing it, beat her upon the head.  That way, she might still do it, but at least she won't be giggling when it happens.  Women everywhere applaud you.  Oh, my God.  I apologize.  Iron Mike Tyson.  Sorry, it's not Opie and Anthony.  It's Iron Mike.  Let's go to another Mike on the line.  Only serious questions for Leah at this point. 
[00:52:30]  Mike, what do you got?  Opie and Anthony, all your listeners sound like they're whacked out of their heads.  I know.  We apologize.  But anyway, my cousin works at the city morgue.  And I like to sneak in there on Fridays and, you know, fool around with the recently deceased people.  Is that normal or?  No, that's not normal.  I mean, that's called necrophilia.  Should I still wear a condom?  Oh, yeah.  I would think that you probably would want to. 
[00:53:00]  What if all sex should I?  I can't receive it, obviously.  Did you guys have all your friends?  No, we don't have friends, Leah.  Believe me.  These are our listeners.  We love them.  Yeah.  If I were you, first of all, I don't know if what you're doing is legal.  I mean, they're not complaining.  I don't think, well, I can imagine that they're not complaining.  That's the most action they're probably going to get for a long time.  Yeah.  I mean, what about the oral sex issue?  I think that, you know what? 
[00:53:30]  I don't know what you can, honestly, you don't know what you can catch from dead people, I'm sure.  All kinds of things.  Yeah, it's probably, you know.  I really, that's not something I actually am an expert in.  Well, Mike, thanks for the call.  We appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.  We've got to move on here, but let's take a couple more.  Josh.  Yo.  Let's get it back on the road here.  You got a question for Leah?  Yeah, I do.  My girlfriend likes me to tie a rope around her neck and pull her real tight when I'm having sex with her.  Amen, Josh.  Now, if you only couple that with some punches to the face, head, chest, and back region, you'll be doing it like I and Mike. 
[00:54:00]  Hello?  Leah?  Mm-hmm.  I think we lost that call.  I'm sorry.  I can't imagine why.  Okay.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you got a question for Leah?  Yeah, I got this problem.  Mm-hmm.  My girlfriend tells me that my member smells.  Uh-huh.  And even after I get out of the shower, it smells. 
[00:54:30]  Like, I don't understand.  Like, she did a teabag on me, and she just almost threw up in my face.  Yeah?  So.  Are you circumcised?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I'm serious, because, you know, sometimes, I don't know what it could be.  You're going to have to go to the doctor.  Well, is there any lotion?  Is there any, like, lotion or something that tastes good that I could put on there?  Ew, lotion has the worst taste.  Have you ever gotten lotion in your mouth?  It's like getting open.  You know what works?  The type of lotion, Vaseline.  Apply it very quickly with your right hand. 
[00:55:00]  It won't help the smell, but then you won't care.  That's true.  Any advice for Steve there, Leah?  I'm saying you're probably going to have to go talk to the doctor about it.  I don't know.  You know, the smell could be anything.  It could be the soap you're using.  You could be having a reaction to it.  It could be that, you know, you've got an infection.  It could be you're not cleaning properly.  It could be you just had sex with a dirty horn.  And she stunk up your member.  That's like robber.  That's what they're there for. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  Let's move on to John.  John, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Leah, I have a question for you.  My wife gets very irritated inside whenever I'm banging her sister.  What can I do about that?  Oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding me.  The ironic thing, though, is she doesn't get irritated when I prank her brother.  What could be the difference?  Leah, I believe that was a prank call.  Yeah, we apologize.  We apologize.  So let's...  Let's talk to all the others.  No, all the others were definitely right on. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, those are right.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I have a problem with my dog.  When I have sex with him, he won't come or I call him.  Is there a way...  Should I romance him a little bit?  Yeah, you should make the kibble in with the wet food.  That really turns him on.  Because I used to be into necrophiliac bestiality.  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine.  They're dead animals.  Oh, God.  But I got moved on.  I thought it was more than...  Oh, God.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Well, thank you, Glenn.  Jeez, it's so hard to weed through these calls and get the real ones.  Dave?  How you doing, guys?  It's a shame that we don't know what these people want to talk about.  I have to ask her a question.  Sorry about that.  Yes, Dave.  Seriously.  I've heard that if you're having...  Well, I guess taking a girl from the back door and you knock her unconscious, I heard  she tightens up.  Is that true?  That is absolutely true.  I will answer that.  Does Mike know all about that?  She tightens up real good.  You've got to combine it with some lefts and rights to the ears.  I feel like I'm running the gauntlet. 
[00:57:00]  Like, if I stick it out to the end, something good is going to happen.  But I have to be like this.  Yeah, I am, Michael.  Come over there and give you a few punches to the universe.  But seriously, does that help?  Does that really...  Because I'll do it with my girlfriend.  I'll just knock her right the hell out.  I hope she turns around and kicks you so hard she ruptures one of your nuts.  Dave, it's all about feeling good.  And then, you know, I mean, once she's out, I can play cards on her.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  That was a really quality question.  Dave sounds like a true gentleman. 
[00:57:30]  Yes.  Leah.  A what?  Whenever I take a girl to my hotel room and rip her clothes off and have sex with her  against her will, she always files a rape suit.  How do I stop the bitches from doing this short of killing the bitch?  I suggest that you remove the offending member.  Give you a lot less problems.  Okay.  With that, let's wrap this up with Joe.  Joe?  Joe, what's going on?  You got a question for Leah?  Yeah.  Opie and Andy, I'm really glad I got through.  I've been seeing this girl for like two weeks. 
[00:58:00]  You know, we tried to be intimate like three times.  And every time, like, we try to have intercourse, her penis keeps getting in the way.  I don't know what, you know, I haven't been with a lot of girls or any, like, girls.  But what do you guys do when your girl's penis is getting in the way?  Leah, do you have an answer to that?  No, but I'm sure you do.  No, I don't.  I know that you're a little bit more of an expert on this.  No, no, I don't have a...  I don't know what to do. 
[00:58:30]  You're in San Francisco.  I think you could answer this question.  Yeah.  Well, I think there's a few of that.  I think there's a little bit of that going on in New York.  Yeah.  You know, I keep saying, Dominic, what do I do with this?  I don't know what to do.  You've got to help me out.  Okay, Joe.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, Leah, this was a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Do you suggest our listeners pound the website with more questions for you?  Absolutely.  I got pound uterus.  There we go.  Couple of body blows. 
[00:59:00]  That's my...  I am my hammer sex.  So, Leah, you definitely want our listeners to, you know, check out the website and pound  the website with more questions for you.  Yeah, I do.  You're sure, right?  Sure.  Okay, good.  And that website again?  www.IGN4men.com.  That's F-O-R-M-E-N.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Leah.  Thanks, guys.  This was a lot of fun today.  Great.  Thanks.  I hope you had fun.  Oh, I did.  All right.  Cool.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Leah, everyone. 
[00:59:30]  She's completely disgusted.  You guys did a great job.  Yeah, bravo.  You finally caught on.  The audience comes through.  Only the serious questions.  What a bunch of clowns.  I have a friend that works at the morgue.  Good news, everyone.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  What's happening, guys?  You haven't figured it out yet. 
[01:00:00]  It's not Opie and Anthony.  Actually, it's just Rick, the producer, hanging in for the guys.  They are on vacation this week.  And it's somebody who called up on the phone earlier and said, why are they on vacation?  Because people go on vacation.  Simple as that.  Right.  Nah.  Anyhow.  Doing the worst of today.  If you've got any suggestions for today's worst of, please give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Let us know what you want to hear in terms of bits.  Getting lots of great requests.  We got Dice when he visited the studio back about nine months ago. 
[01:00:30]  That's coming up in the 5 o'clock hour.  Lots of requests for Spaz Radio, which is coming up next hour in the 4 o'clock hour.  And tons of other stuff, including this one that I'm going to do next, which is off the  Demented World City.  The world-famous butt plug.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:01:00]  May I help you?  Yes, butt plugs.  Who?  Butt plugs.  Butt plugs, yes, me.  How can I help you?  Butt plugs.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Butt plugs.  A butt box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  Butt?  Butt plugs?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about? 
[01:01:30]  Butt plugs, yes.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug.  What kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  No, butt plug.  I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  A butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug. 
[01:02:00]  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, but, but, but, what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to fix...  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah, okay, I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt?  Butt plug.  Oh, sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want. 
[01:02:30]  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah, I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah, we don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So pay attention, answer.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Stephen Lynch in the studio.  This music's too loud.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  I've heard from people, too, like the music that's playing when we come out of a break. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  It'll be loud in our phones.  Right.  So we sound like we're yelling over the music, but it's all equalized going out of the air.  So sometimes it sounds like, hey, how you doing?  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back.  Oh, my ears are bleeding.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Rick was telling a cute little story while we were in a commercial break.  Yeah.  How long have you been married, Rick? 
[01:03:30]  I believe you're up to 10 days.  T plus 10 days.  No.  10 days back from your honeymoon, a day and a half.  In an hour, it'll be 12 days total.  All right.  Okay.  So 12 days, a dozen days.  Dozen days.  Now, Rick, you did quite well with the wedding checks, I believe.  We did okay, but it wasn't about money.  No.  Yeah, but, I mean, let's face it.  When you get married, you get very excited to open up those envelopes.  You do get a little giddy, don't you, there, Rick?  Just a little bit.  That sack is in front of you, and you're just kind of opening up envelopes going, look at this one. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Like, I don't even like these people.  So you're sitting there and thinking of all the funny things you could buy with the money, right?  Yeah.  Right?  You're sitting there going, wow, look at all this money.  I could buy that.  Especially, you know, all the work I did the past year.  Sure, sure.  The extra hours I put in.  So, Rick, how long did it take before you realized you'd have no say in how the money was spent?  Well, it hit me on the 11th day. 
[01:04:30]  11th day, which was yesterday.  About 8 p.m.  Some of the money was spent yesterday?  Yeah.  How much money was spent yesterday?  I came home and I found...  Wait, wait, wait, no.  Just how much money did she spend yesterday?  She spent...  That's all I want to know right now.  600 bucks, did you say?  Six hundred dollars.  Okay, now I'm thinking...  We got some good stuff.  That's a major purchase.  Probably, I'm guessing, either major appliance, something like that, to make the little woman's life a little easier around the homestead, right? 
[01:05:00]  All right, kids, hold on to your steering wheel really tight.  So what did she spend the money on, Rick?  Well, um...  We had registered for some things that we never got.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Just get to it.  Go.  She bought pots.  Come on!  Are you kidding me?  No.  She bought pots.  Now, six hundred...  Six hundred... 
[01:05:30]  A hundred dollars worth of pots.  Pots.  Well, I'm thinking you must get a hell of a lot of pots.  That's what I said.  That's what I said.  That's what I said.  For six hundred dollars.  You sure she said she spent it on pots and not pot?  Yeah, there were no, like, you know, bangs around the house.  All right, this is old shit.  It's on the marijuana.  All right, six hundred dollars on pots. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  So now I'm thinking probably a pot for any occasion.  Hundreds of pots could be bought for six hundred dollars.  I am dead.  How many pots were purchased for six hundred dollars?  Uh...  Seven pots.  Seven pots.  Does George Foreman come to your house, too, and cook for that price?  Actually, we got that.  The George Foreman lean, mean, fat-burning, grilling machine. 
[01:06:30]  And we got it from you and Jen.  George...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  All right, hold on.  Pete, what's up?  No way.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  I gave you a check, you bastard.  I gave you cash.  Did you?  I know I did.  You didn't...  Get out of here!  The day I give you a goddamn grilling machine, put it over my friggin' head.  We got the George Foreman fat-busting grill from you. 
[01:07:00]  No.  Look.  Ass wipe.  Look.  I really think...  There is no way in hell you got the George Foreman grilling fat-burning machine from us.  We did.  Dude, look, I'm pissed now.  I wrote a friggin' check for you, man.  Cash.  I understand that.  I got out of the car with no, uh, grabbed gift or anything.  Right.  It was an envelope with a check in it.  You seem to have crossed up some of your labeling on, on gifts that were given out. 
[01:07:30]  Unless Opie was playing a joke on me, got the grilling machine, and slapped our name on it.  Dude, you mean you went 12 days thinking I gave you a goddamn George Foreman grilling machine?  Linda, Linda, if you're listening, Rick's wife, if you're listening, there's no way we got you a George Foreman grilling machine.  You're joking with me, right? 
[01:08:00]  No, I'm not joking, dude.  Rick, I swear to you.  I swear to Christ to you.  And the funniest part about it, dude, we were psyched.  You're like, cool!  I don't care how psyched you are.  We did not get you a grilling machine.  A friggin' infomercial product I get our producer for his wedding?  Dude, I cut you a pretty good check.  Find it.  You could buy another half a pot of that money. 
[01:08:30]  She could get at least another two or three pots.  Yeah.  I am gonna friggin' faint.  Are you kidding me?  You've been thinking that we got you that?  Bro, I'm mocking you.  Oh my God, you've got us a friggin' infomercial thing.  Where's the Thighmaster from Opie and Sandy?  Actually, we were expecting the slam, man.  Rick, I swear to you.  No.  There was no George Foreman grilling machine.  Are you sure it wasn't you? 
[01:09:00]  Positive.  I could have sworn it was you, man.  Positive.  Holy mother of pearl.  Hey, I am livid.  Cheryl, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm thinking that maybe Ben gave that as a bridal shower gift.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That could have been it.  All right, well, a bridal shower gift, that's fine.  But it still came from you.  Not a wedding gift.  You had your name on it.  You did not.  You did?  A bridal shower gift?  With the lingerie.  Nothing better for George, George, George, George, and George.  And Rick and Linda. 
[01:09:30]  And showing he cares about our producer, Rick.  Come on.  Uh-uh.  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  Hey, where's Rick?  Is he there?  I'm right here.  What are you, half a fag or something like that?  Everyone's a fag.  At least I'm half a fag.  What?  What do I do now?  Now, when you take a p***, pal, what are you doing giving your wife any money at all?  What are you talking about?  What's my thoughts at, Ben?  You're crazy.  Check your penis at the door, pal.  You don't need it anymore.  Thanks. 
[01:10:00]  I think he's more pissed than I am.  Eric, what's going on?  You know what, man?  Fess up to the grilling machine, man.  And it's all gay.  Get him up to Nell's.  Apologize.  Fess up to Nell's.  That wasn't his wedding gift.  I was going to say, that's a great gift in the black community at a wedding, right?  Absolutely, man.  I got married.  I could cook up my crack in that.  I got like 50 cents of towels, man.  So, like, I've been married now 12 years. 
[01:10:30]  I've still got towels I haven't even freaking used yet.  All right, Eric.  Very good.  What's the difference between guys and girls?  Let me put a lady on the phone here.  Michelle, what's going on?  Oh, I knew you were coming for me when I heard that.  What's up, Michelle?  Well, that's reasonable if it's a good set of pans.  $600 is a reasonable price for seven pots?  Think about it.  Think about it.  If you're going to buy a set now for $150 or whatever, and then three years from now,  buy another set.  Three years from now, buy another set.  Is the logic of the ladies?  This is the logic I got last night. 
[01:11:00]  Of course.  This will last us 10 to 15 years.  12 years.  What kind of pots are they?  I don't know.  They're pots.  Pots.  My mother has pots in her house that I swear I remember her cooking me soupy when I was  six, when I was a kid.  The same pots.  And they probably cost like $10.  Pots.  $600 on seven pots.  Phil, what's up?  This might not be a bad thing for Rick.  The key question is, Rick, if you came home with, say, a $600 stereo receiver, would you 
[01:11:30]  get the shit beat out of you, or would that be cool?  Because if it works both ways, you could work this to your advantage.  No, I'm not going to be spending $600.  I won't get clearance on that.  Clearance.  Clearance.  Clearance.  Close, man.  It's all over for the client.  You've got no chance.  If she can go and drop six, and you don't have a peep to say about it, and if you did  the same thing, you're hosed, it's, you know, just turn over everything. 
[01:12:00]  Thank you, Phil.  Well, see, here's what led to the $600 pot story.  There we go.  Okay.  We're flying back from Aruba, and she said, you know, one of the things I wanted us to  get that we didn't get for the wedding were these sets of pots that I registered for.  Planting the seed on the way home.  Look at that.  Planting a little seed.  Yeah, after a week's longest sex, I figured, you know.  So, she goes, they're like $300, $350 bucks, the ones she registered for.  Well, that was 10 months ago. 
[01:12:30]  That set is not available anymore at Williams-Sonoma.  So, it's their fault, Rick?  So, now it's the $600 set of pots.  Are you defending her by saying the store screwed up by not having them?  No, this is how I got suckered in.  So, then when I got home, and she goes, I got you this, and I got you this, and I got  you Tostitos, and I got you little weenies, and I got you this.  Like, she bought me all these, like, little food.  And I got $600 worth of pots.  Right.  Exactly.  Trying to run it past you.  Exactly.  And it was just like, and it's like she's softening the blow. 
[01:13:00]  Like, and I got the pots.  I'm like, oh, cool.  How much was the final total?  Oh, $600.  Well, they didn't have the ones I registered for.  Yeah.  And you said I could go and get them.  So, $600.  You think you know what you'd do?  You'd come home someday and go, look, they didn't have the Sony Walkman I wanted, so I  had to get the big screen digital television set.  Yeah, I had to get the big screen TV. 
[01:13:30]  Jay, what do you have to add?  Is Rick Weisschance short for Richard?  No, it's not.  Ah, I was going to say, there's another nickname for Richard that sounds like Rick, and I think  you're going to have to start bawling yourself out for a while.  If you're trying to tell you, don't get married, we spend weeks trying to tell you, don't get  married.  Oh, my God.  I was going to say what Anthony said.  Why don't you walk out and just try to buy a TV, like a 32-inch stereo TV.  See what happens.  I already got one of those, and she was there for it. 
[01:14:00]  Okay, well, buy one for your room, though, just for you, like, to watch football games  on a weekend.  That goes in your room, and then you get the big screen TV.  I'm talking the, like, 56.  We don't have the room, dude.  Who cares?  Buy it.  It's not a matter of even watching it.  You never have to turn it on.  You just have to purchase it.  That's it.  In the hallway.  That's it.  A doorstop.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  I'll tell you.  I'm listening to you guys, and I'll tell you, Rick's actually lucky, because at least he's  got something sizable to show up for $600. 
[01:14:30]  My brother's rich of a wife just spent $600 on six steak knives.  Six steak knives.  $100 a night.  One set of Hankle steak knives for $600.  I could appreciate a purchase like this.  I don't know what's funnier.  By the way, Rick, did you get the George Foreman grill that I sent?  Yeah, I don't know what's funnier.  Rick's wife spending $600 on pots, or Anthony finding out that he gave the George Foreman  grill as a wedding gift.  I did not.  You did. 
[01:15:00]  It wasn't a wedding gift.  Your name was on it.  I don't know whether it was given to you as a bridal shower gift, or given to Linda as  a bridal shower gift.  That was not your wedding present from us.  It was not the George Foreman fat burning grilling machine thing that he sells.  Hey, George, what's up?  I want to ask Anthony, when you ordered the George Foreman grill machine, are you making  four easy payments on that, or did you tell you all at once? 
[01:15:30]  What's the matter with you?  Nah, four easy payments.  Did he throw in a Mark McGuire rookie card?  Be dialing people.  George Foreman grill.  Look at the fat it burns off.  And you get a Sosa rookie card and a Beanie Baby.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, you guys got to play back all those days where we told Rick not to get married. 
[01:16:00]  He was sounding so pompous and all full of himself.  Now he sounds like a beaten dog.  Oh, I'm not that beaten.  I still got my car.  Oh, your little yellow sports car?  Hopefully, that'll be home when I get home.  Rick still has his little yellow sports car.  How long, we'll take a little pool here, how long before it's traded in for an Astrovan?  Huh?  How long before the Dodge Caravan's in the driveway and your little yellow sports car,  the impractical two-seater, is gonzo? 
[01:16:30]  God, I hope it's home when I get home.  Andrea.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Rick, how many pots did you say you got in?  You got seven pots.  Are you sure?  Is it a set of seven?  Uh-oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Because if it's a set of seven, you know what you're paying for.  You're paying for three pots, maybe a pan, and three lids.  Oh, they count the lids on the part of the set?  No, we definitely got seven pots out of the deal.  Are you sure about that?  Yeah.  Oh, well, then you didn't get ripped off.  No.  And for an extra hundred, we'll throw in handles. 
[01:17:00]  I'm doubting this.  Yeah, it's a 20-piece set.  Well, we include the screws that hold the handles on, the washers, everything.  Pot's not included.  Rick, I want to know.  I've got to come over someday and have maybe some Campbell's tomato soup cooked in an almost  $100 pot.  And it's got to be good.  And then it's got to taste better than, like, just a regular old pot.  And then we can grill you up a nice grilled cheese sandwich with your George Foreman fat 
[01:17:30]  muffin grill, man.  It'll be a nice soup and sandwich for you.  Oh, good.  Dude, if we have to run out for any groceries, you could take me in your Dodge Caravan.  We'll pass your sports car at the lot where it was traded in for your Astro fan.  You know, I feel so free.  I think I'm going to go out tonight and spend $600 in hookers and drugs.  Just because I can.  Cutting down tonight?  Do you like any of this crap?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:18:00]  1027 WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  Here we go.  Yes, the ONA show.  Lots to do today.  We'll get into all that in just a minute.  All right.  Let's see.  What else would we want to get here today?  Thirsty monkeys?  This, I have to say, is the story of the day.  How the hell did this happen? 
[01:18:30]  Well, let me read a little bit for you, Anthony.  Thirsty monkeys stoned herdsmen to death.  I love this.  Cue music.  No.  In Nairobi, a group of thirsty monkeys stoned a herdsman to death in drought-stricken northern Kenya  as he watered his livestock, a newspaper reported Thursday.  Why?  In a clear sign of worsening drought, a herdsman was killed after the rioting monkeys stoned him 
[01:19:00]  at a watering point.  A nurse in the district said the man died from severe head injury.  Head injury?  Good aim on the monkeys.  Damn.  All they wanted was a little bit of water.  Could he not spare a few drops of water for these poor primates?  My God! 
[01:19:30]  Just a little taste of water for their red monkey asses.  And everything would have been fine.  He'd have been alive today.  But no, he denied the monkey.  Damn you!  Damn you!  I needed water.  And Zira came up and gave me a drink of water.  God damn it, I love that monkey bitch. 
[01:20:00]  She gave me water.  I got water from a monkey!  And he wouldn't give water back to these poor thirsty monkeys!  Damn him!  They gave you a lot of water when you were in that cage with the...  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  God damn, good aim on the monkeys.  Head injuries. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Crack shots.  You know, they couldn't hit me with bullets when Dr. Zayas was shooting.  But they hit him in the head with rocks.  How does a monkey know that the guy has water and he isn't giving it to him?  I know.  I don't understand this story.  Explain that one.  There's no way the monkey knows he has water.  He doesn't know to pick a block to throw them at him.  Are you sure this is Nairobi?  Maybe they're smarter than we thought, Anthony. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  They are intelligent.  Smart monkeys.  They live in little clay houses.  I've seen it.  Take your sticky paws off me, damn dirty ape.  Oh, holy.  Nova.  Nova.  Look, they're throwing rocks at Nova.  Damn you monkeys.  I just don't get it.  A bunch of riotous monkeys. 
[01:21:30]  Let me get this straight.  Riotous monkeys.  Yeah.  Red ass stupid monkeys.  Right.  See a sheep herder.  Yes.  Giving water to his sheep.  Correct.  They get mad because he's not giving them water.  Correct.  And they start throwing rocks.  Right.  Why do they just go and take the water?  I don't know.  There was more of them, right? 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  My God, man.  That's an amazing story.  Either this guy is incredibly stupid, or those are some smart monkeys.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'd have kicked them in their tiny red asses.  Yes.  Yes.  What's that, Cornelius?  Zero's pregnant, and it's not yours. 
[01:22:30]  Damn, you caught me again.  I couldn't take my hands off of her saggy monkey udders.  That red ass is a bullseye for jumping.  I love it.  Are you sure?  I still, I don't understand.  Are you sure, nigga?  Are you sure they weren't drinking malt liquor?  That's all I gotta say. 
[01:23:00]  Stop it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Huh?  Maybe it was Reginald Denny.  Ah, what?  Yaddle doodles.  Bone dry.  Bone dry, damn you.  Apologize.  Apologize.  No wonder they throw rocks.  Bone dry.  Bone dry. 
[01:23:30]  Damn monkeys.  I heard they threw 41 rocks.  Yes.  But only 19 hit him.  Right.  I heard he was down, and they kept throwing rocks at him.  Bastard monkeys.  Why?  The guy was just holding his wallet.  And they threw rocks at him, and continued, even when Ashi was down. 
[01:24:00]  Why, damn you?  Damn.  They just said, please, can we have some water in their native monkey tongue.  The shepherd just didn't know how to deal with the monkeys.  No justice, no peace.  That's wrong to me.  No justice.  Maybe the Yankees can recruit these guys.  He's a cool cat.  He's a cool cat indeed.  He's just said, when you see riotous monkeys, give them water, for God's sake. 
[01:24:30]  What's wrong with you?  All right.  I never thought they were that smart.  There'll be a rally at noon tomorrow.  I've never heard this.  What to do?  What to do?  Riotous monkeys.  All right.  Listen.  Have all the water you want.  Around me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  It's awful.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yes.  Jesus.  Horrifying.  All right.  All right.  All right.  They keep coming back.  Apologizing.  All right.  Phone number 212-757-1027.  We'll go to the phones next.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027-WMW. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  It's not Opie.  Not Anthony.  What's up, guys?  It's Rick, the producer, sitting in for the guys.  They're on vacation.  They have been on vacation all week.  So, if you didn't know that, probably they're living in their cave.  Maybe you're out of town.  I don't know what else.  What else could be your excuse?  We're doing the worst of all week this week.  We've got tomorrow to do it as well.  Guys will return fresh, ready to go, bright and early. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, somewhat early.  Monday.  So, make sure you check it out when they do return from their vacation.  In the meantime, a lot of people have been requesting this.  They've been requesting it for a while, all week.  And I told you it would be coming up.  Spaz Radio.  Yeah, when Spaz, our big red retard, brings in his radio audition tape for the guys to check out and, you know, give them their feedback on.  And he mistakenly gives it to them, like, the day before they're coming into work. 
[01:26:30]  So, of course, they're going to listen to it.  And you've just got to sit back.  If you've never heard this before, you've only heard about it, sit back.  It's about, be prepared to be here for the next hour and a half or so.  Because this is some of the funniest stuff they have ever done.  All right?  So, sit back.  Relax.  Eat something quickly before this gets started.  Maybe take one last sip of your drink.  And here it is. 
[01:27:00]  It's Spaz Radio.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Your lowest common denominator.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is there anything to say that?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Quick, change the channel.  No!  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony in the studio, we've got Spaz, our buddy, our pal, who works on the radio show.  He hasn't been on the radio in a couple weeks, thank God. 
[01:27:30]  But he's been busy screening the phone calls for the radio, and he does a great job.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  I think we can agree on that point.  Well, Spaz gave me his radio audition tape as I was leaving the building yesterday.  Because I, I guess, wasn't worthy enough to listen to it and offer up an opinion.  Right.  My total lack of radio experience that Spaz sees it.  Yeah.  Well, Spaz.  What?  Do you realize this is the number one radio market in the country? 
[01:28:00]  Yes, I do.  Do you realize pretty much, whether you like him, hate him, or what have you, anybody in  a major market radio has enough experience to critique a college radio tape?  Yeah.  I'm almost insulted.  If it wasn't coming from you, I would be insulted, but I couldn't possibly be insulted.  I apologize.  By you.  Well, that's okay, Spaz.  Once again, Anthony and I played the tape.  I look like we're in Iowa.  It's like I'm an intern at an Iowa radio station. 
[01:28:30]  You can't take my tape.  So, Anthony and I checked out the tape while we were stuck in traffic on the way in today,  and you kept us very entertained.  Usually, we have major road rage, especially with the 59th Street Bridge being effed up like  it is lately.  We were stuck in traffic.  We didn't care because we were laughing so damn hard.  That is a fact.  That is a fact.  People were looking at us like, what the hell are they listening to that they're laughing  so hard?  We should have had hockey helmets on for what we looked like in that truck. 
[01:29:00]  Swear to God.  Well, Anthony, there's already people calling in because I told people to call up and comment  about Spaz's radio audition tape.  Yeah.  We haven't even played any of it yet, and people are already calling in.  Well, I would love to know what someone would have to say before they hear it.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Dude.  Yeah.  You guys, I couldn't even imagine what you guys were like on the bridge.  I mean, I call in all the time, and I talk to him just on the phone.  Yeah.  I can imagine what these tapes are going to be like.  If you don't mind, I want to hang on the air and just listen to this because this has 
[01:29:30]  got to be probably the funniest thing I'm ever going to hear in my entire life.  All right.  I'll put you on hold, and we'll go to you from time to time with your comments as well,  okay?  Right on.  Thanks, Al.  All right.  Who else is...  Do we have someone screening the call?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go, Anthony.  All right.  So I guess we could get into Spaz's audition tape.  Let's get right into it.  This tape was made when, Spaz?  Over the weekend?  Over the weekend.  Yeah, because he's talking about some current events in this tape.  He's talking about Khalid Muhammad's Million Youth March. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  He's talking about the killer mosquito.  Yeah, don't get confused.  This isn't a tape from years ago or something at a college radio station or anything.  This is just this weekend.  Right.  A couple days ago, he's talking about the Subway Series a little bit, kind of.  All right.  A little baseball talk.  A little baseball talk back there.  You better watch it, Maggie.  And he has some comments about Hillary Clinton.  Mm-hmm.  Politics.  Good.  Well-rounded.  Well-rounded.  And Janet Reno out of nowhere.  All right.  So we're going to play the first break, Spaz. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  This is you opening up your radio show, right?  Yes.  Okay.  What were you trying to get across in your first break here?  I don't know.  We're just going to go through the process with you.  That's all.  All right.  I wanted to start off with a voiceover to show I could do a voiceover.  Okay.  A voiceover.  Intro to music, you know, and hype up the show, or what you can expect in the hour.  Okay.  Coming up and everything like that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  So it's kind of like a radio tease, you know?  Yes.  I'm K-Dawg.  It's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And by the way, his name is not Kevin or Spaz on his radio show. 
[01:31:00]  It is...  K-Dawg.  K-Dawg.  K-Dawg.  Look how he says that with a thought.  So over a long, I think it's a metallic intro, you're going to tell everyone what they could  expect on the K-Dawg radio show, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Let's start here then.  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday  or Saturday.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Uh-oh.  You didn't know what day you were on?  I screwed up in the beginning.  So I...  But I covered it very well in the next statement. 
[01:31:30]  What?  Or Saturday, I'm sorry?  No.  The next statement, I said, I'm just...  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to get into the weekend like everybody else.  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  So you were a little confused what day it was, right?  Yeah.  No real big deal if you're trying to be on the radio.  Sure.  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday  or Saturday.  I'm sorry.  Just trying to get...  Wait, wait.  What was that?  Everybody else's...  What?  Wait a minute.  What are you doing?  What?  It's like Friday by Saturday. 
[01:32:00]  Do you hear that?  What?  He's got some kind of breathing thing on?  Dude, play that again.  All right.  Hold on.  This could take forever today.  Yeah, I'm kicking it off here at about four o'clock in the afternoon here on this Friday  or Saturday.  I'm sorry.  Just trying to get into the weekend as everybody else is.  But...  What?  What is that?  You can't be snorting into the microphone like that.  It's phlegm.  It's when I'm breathing through my mouth. 
[01:32:30]  That's the sound of me.  Well, you've got to fix that.  Or something.  All right.  So the K-Dog radio show has begun, Anthony.  Yeah, how would I know?  Right.  That's their inexperience.  It's like the K-Dog radio show has begun.  All right.  And so far, Spaz is not really sure what day it is.  That's a good start, though, Spaz.  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  But we're going to kick you off a little program here with a little bit of Metallica.  And...  As he walks away from the...  He's got a little bit of you.  Good mic technique. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Anyway, yeah.  We're going to be getting into more of the musical Rob Zombie and Ramstein and other good stuff.  We're going to be talking about some news going around.  There's a killer justito going around in Queens right now.  The Mets, the Yankees, and that Million Man Youth March.  We'll see how good that goes.  Million Man Youth March.  What?  Million Man Youth March?  It's the Million Man March or the Million Youth March.  Never both.  You can't be a man and a youth at the same time.  The Million Man Youth March. 
[01:33:30]  I like that other part.  I know.  Wait.  I'm going back.  There's going to be comments about, like, riots or something.  Hold on.  Here we go.  The Million Man Youth March.  We'll see how good that goes.  You can see the riots right now.  Anyway, as everybody fears for their life in Harlem.  What?  Spaz is like bashing black people.  Right off the bat.  What's up with that?  I was trying to make it.  People are fearing for their lives? 
[01:34:00]  You're wacky.  So they're fearing for their lives and they're like, what the hell?  I might as well tune in the K-Dog radio show?  Yeah, you know.  They're going to have a big good connection with the story into the show.  All right.  All right.  Let me go back.  What?  All right.  Let's hear this again.  Let's get into that Million Man Youth March.  Let's see how good that goes.  We'll see the riots right now.  Anyway, as everybody fears for their life in Harlem, listen for, you know, content and 
[01:34:30]  giveaways later on here at WSR 610 AM.  We've got some t-shirts and other stuff like that.  Anyway, let's just continue on to music.  We're going to kick you off with Metallica.  Hey, for black.  We're here at WSR 610 AM on the College Radio.  For number 623-2369.  Drop a bit of a request.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Go up to the studio.  This is K-Dog.  All right.  Let's get some listener reaction on the instant feedback. 
[01:35:00]  It'll be Greg from Jersey says, guys, this isn't even funny.  It's just sad.  And Ian from Syosset, please, I beg you, put the K-Dog to sleep.  What is your little catchphrase?  Drop a dime.  I used to say, drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Oh, that's cute.  Do you know what a phone call costs these days?  I know, but, you know, it's just catchy, I thought.  Someone else has a little critique.  I don't know how experienced this guy is in radio, but he's offering his critique. 
[01:35:30]  Rich from New York City.  Get the tissues out of your nose.  You're not calling in sick to work.  Let's go to the phones real fast, Ant.  Frank, what's up?  I'm going to drop a quarter.  Oh, my God, I almost crashed.  When is that million-man youth mark?  I found K-Dog.  I felt like a dog.  My head was twisting when I hear a word is on. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, my.  What the hell is going on?  Well, we're going to teach Spaz or K-Dog a little bit about,  radio today.  It sounded like he was snoring.  I was going to fall asleep, too.  If I wasn't laughing, I would have been asleep.  All right, Frank, thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Can we go to some instant feedback real quick?  Steve from the Foundry Music website.  Okay.  As you know, Steve, wanting to get into broadcasting,  he's going to school right now.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  He says,  God damn, I've been busting my ass on a demo for the past month,  so I'll sound perfect.  And that's what Kevin hands in.  Oh, my God, what a tragedy.  It's a rough draft.  Rough draft.  All right, calm down, everyone.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, if you ask me,  I think K-Dog is trying to audition to be Will Penn Tarvis on K-Rock or something,  because he's horrible.  All right.  ONA, you guys suck Spaz.  You rusty trombone.  All right, thank you.  See you later.  All right.  So was that the end of your first break? 
[01:37:00]  You set up your radio show there, Spaz?  The first break, yes.  All right.  Mind you, this whole tape is a rough draft.  Okay.  Oh, rough draft.  By the way, I noticed throughout your radio audition  that you were, like, recording your segues.  Yes.  Oof.  Why?  Because I want to...  Like, one song would fade out,  and then I guess he's trying to show a future boss  that he's able to start another song as the other one's ending, right?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You don't need to put that on a tape.  I don't?  No, a monkey could do that.  Oh. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, seriously.  All right.  Should we move on with his audition tape?  Oh, of course.  All right.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  In all fairness for K-Dawg,  this is his second break of his radio audition tape anthem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's coming out of Ugly Kid Joe's Neighbor, right?  Yes.  All right.  So he figured he'd work the song title into his rap to start this break.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  You're at, uh...  Come on!  WICR?  Wait a minute.  Did you forget what radio station you were at?  Did you?  No.  I just lost train of thought there for a second.  Oh.  The train of thought derailed many miles back.  Wait, Spaz.  All right.  You start your radio show,  and you're not really sure what day of the week it is, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And now I'm hearing on this tape that you really weren't sure what radio station you were at. 
[01:38:30]  Let me question.  Drop a dog.  Drop a dime.  What did that say again?  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  All right.  Here he comes to start his second break with that neighbor thing.  And listen closely.  Spaz kind of forgot what radio station he's broadcasting for.  Drop a nickel.  Suck my pickle.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  Here at, uh... 
[01:39:00]  WICR?  I just climbed it.  It's like four and a half seconds.  You didn't know your call letter?  Did you have to look up and read it from somewhere or what?  Was that manipulated?  That's not manipulated.  That's how you gave me the tape.  Are you serious?  Yeah, look.  Listen.  Listen for yourself.  You don't know what radio station you're broadcasting.  I was about to learn.  I almost said N-E-W.  Oh, he's dreaming now.  Jesus. 
[01:39:30]  All right, listen.  You're at, uh...  WICR.  It's like...  You're at, uh...  W-Y?  That whole thing.  All right.  All right, so you had him with the K-Dog.  So he's growling.  Oh, I get it now. 
[01:40:00]  Holy Jesus.  All right, so you had a little trouble trying to remember what radio station you're at.  I guess not!  I guess that happens with all the pros in the biz.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Let's move on with the second break here.  All right.  610 AM out of college radio for number 633-2369.  That was Ugly Kid Joe with Neighbor.  And before that, you heard Fear Factory with their new single cars.  As well as we opened up the show with Metallica.  Yes, there is none higher.  With Fade to Black. 
[01:40:30]  Anyway, we're going to be getting some more news later on.  I'm talking about that deadly mosquito going around in Queens.  What's the deadly mosquito?  Is it like as big as Godzilla and it's attacking people?  It killed a couple of people.  You make it sound like it's this huge, like, 20-foot creature.  The deadly mosquito.  I'm trying to make the story so people would listen to me.  So this is a radio tease?  They're going to have to tune in to make sure it's not a huge, giant mosquito?  Yes, because I'm trying to give them a headline to capture my audience. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, is that it?  Like the tease?  Wow, the instant feedback.  Just going wild, Opie.  Paul from Morristown.  He sounds like he smoked a dime bag before making the tape.  Someone tells Spaz it's okay to go back, listen to his tape before he hands it to anyone.  Then he should ask himself if he would hire the person on the tape.  Get Mr. Rogers off the friggin' air.  Donald in the Bronx says, I'm going to drop a grenade.  This is more painful than watching Ben Stiller get his schween caught in a zipper. 
[01:41:30]  And Xavier, good God in heaven, make this hurting stop.  Make it stop.  It burns my ears.  Get this effin' sorry ass off the air.  Mennon from Brooklyn.  I'd rather wear a Cleveland steamer than hear the rest of this.  Greg in Jersey.  Guys, please tell me that this is a bit and he didn't really do this on his own.  The feedback's just pouring in. 
[01:42:00]  Billy, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  All right.  What the hell?  What is it?  One giant mosquito?  That's what I was trying to tell him.  Like Rodan flying around Queens somewhere?  Yeah, it's doing a flyby, for God's sake.  The giant mosquito.  That's killing people in Queens.  Come on.  It's killing three people.  Hey, this is Don Imus.  This is annoying me because I had Moby Worm, the giant worm.  Remember that, baby?  Hey, Spaz, am I experienced enough to critique your tape? 
[01:42:30]  Just wait.  He tries to pronounce what the people are getting from the time.  Spaz, I think you need a big, fad cowboy hat like Don Imus.  Now, let's say it.  W-A-M-B-Z.  All right.  All right.  So I guess Spaz is teasing a new story to keep his listeners tuned, right, Anthony? 
[01:43:00]  I think he's going to have commentary on the giant mosquito soon.  Me and Rick are going to pee ourselves in the room.  Come on.  It gets much better.  Oh, I know.  Because this is Spaz's news break.  Hold on to your bladder, kids.  Okay, so there's a huge, giant mosquito loose in Queens, and we continue the tape now. 
[01:43:30]  Does it have, like, fangs and stuff, Spaz?  It's right in Astoria right now.  It's a big, giant mosquito.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's move on.  Let's move on to LaGuardia.  Let's move on with the tape.  If you're just tuning in, we're listening to Spaz's radio audition tape.  Just wait until he talks about the Million Youth March.  If he said LaGuardia, we'll come out, LaGuardia.  All right.  Let's do a little traffic in one of the reports. 
[01:44:00]  Watch out for the traffic by LaGuardia Airport.  All right.  Here we go, Ant.  Let's move on.  I'm not going to even get it to Hillary.  I don't want to discuss that, well, can't get my views over the air because it's not meant for on the air.  But, yeah.  All right.  So you went from, okay, so this is like your current event.  What the hell is that?  This is your current event break, I'm assuming.  You want to discuss the issues of the day, right? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  So you're teasing the giant mosquito story that you're going to talk about a little later, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  But now you have some commentary about Hillary Clinton, but it's so outrageous you're not going to tell your listeners.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You had commentary on Hillary.  Yeah.  But it's not for the air.  Yeah, because I didn't know if I was allowed to say that.  Say what I was going to say.  What were you going to say?  Well, unless you were going to call her a c**t.  I don't...  I'm sorry. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  We had a tough hour of the show.  Unless you were going to say something bad about her, bad language or anything, what were you going to say?  What were you going to say about Hillary?  You got some obvious, strong views on Hillary.  Yeah.  I was going to say is that she's a carpet muncher and she shouldn't be in New York because she doesn't know anything about it.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Carpet muncher. 
[01:45:30]  Which is K-Dog's train wrecked.  So you're pretty much telling people that she's a lesbian.  Well, yeah, because she's a butch.  She's been the president for the past two terms.  She's worn out pants in the family.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  So, and I guess what I'm getting from K-Dog's radio audition tape, there's a killer mosquito loose in Queens and Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher, right?  Goddamn, I would listen to this every day.  I swear to God.  I swear to you, if this was on every day, I would listen. 
[01:46:00]  K-Rock ought to hire you.  I swear I would listen every day.  You're definitely better than Stuttering John.  You don't know what the hell's going to happen.  That's not saying much, but.  Okay, so, giant mosquito, Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher.  All right.  Let's continue.  Not a carpet bagger.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  He's getting away from politics.  All right.  Wait.  Hold on.  I've got to go to the phones really fast.  Chris, what's up?  I can do better than that.  And I'm not in radio, and that's a challenge. 
[01:46:30]  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Listen, I tell you what, I just about peed myself sitting here for the last 10 minutes on the line.  I've got to tell you, Anthony, I can understand why he didn't give you the tape to critique.  You know, K-Dawg's vast experience in the music industry has led him to where we're at right now.  I can just imagine where his career is headed to.  He's going to be beyond what you guys can't even imagine.  All right.  Take care, fellas.  All right.  Jesus.  Can we have some more emails coming in? 
[01:47:00]  They're just coming in like crazy.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Johnny thinks K-Dawg should spend more time licking his things.  Good God in heaven, Spaz shouldn't even do commentary for the Special Olympics.  Joe Lyons from Comedy Central checking in.  The Greaseman isn't as racist as Spaz. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, that's right.  He had a comment about the Million Man Youth March.  The Million Man Youth March.  Yeah.  Johnny from Brooklyn.  What's wrong with Spaz?  His mother must have dropped him as a baby.  Corey, does Spaz have the ability to speak in complete sentences or have a complete thought?  What a tool.  And Rich, neither is K-Dawg meant to be on the air.  Maybe in the air when he jumps to his death after this critique.  So, people just checking in like crazy, K-Dawg. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, and if you're just tuning in once again, we're listening to Spaz, a.k.a. K-Dawg's radio audition tape.  Spaz handing me the audition tape on the way home last night.  All right, so I guess we're in the middle of Spaz's current events break-in.  Right.  Giant mosquito Hillary Clinton.  Yeah, well, we just found out that Hillary Clinton is a carpet man, Jack.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Are we going to go back now to Spaz Radio? 
[01:48:30]  Spaz Radio.  From the top of the Spaz building.  All right, ready?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Dan, are we getting some heat about the, you know, the thing in Waco?  Yeah, that thing.  That little distraction a couple years ago.  You also got some news on the, um...  Wait, you didn't bring up Janarino, but you don't even...  Did you elaborate?  Did you elaborate on your thought?  Hold on, I've got to go back again.  That thing in Waco. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Everybody knows what that was about.  They were crashing.  Yeah, but catching some heat.  Why is she catching heat?  What new developments have we found out about what happened at Waco two years ago, or however  many years ago it was?  It was an error, by my judgment, to not speak about that.  Well, do you have any thoughts on Janarino and Waco, Texas, Spaz?  Not at this moment, but I will get back to you.  Do you think the government's holding information from us?  Uh, no, but, um, I just think that, you know, probably is getting a bad rap, because I know 
[01:49:30]  how it feels when...  Huh?  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Because I...  See, because I know how it feels, you know, when...  All right, let him finish his thought.  Okay, he's got some, uh...  Finish his thought.  Come on.  It's only a four-hour show.  Because I know how it feels when your own personnel and your own officers don't help  you out.  They're, like, going against you.  Okay.  Well, I don't know. 
[01:50:00]  All right, so, and here's Spaz talking about Janarino, but he just decided to...  Like Hillary, uh, he just wouldn't talk about it.  Janarino getting some heat about the, uh, you know, the, uh, thing in Waco a couple years  ago.  He also got some news on the, um, the Mets and the Yankees and other such good stuff.  The Millionaire News March, give my commentary on that.  Pretty soon.  Anyway, you were listening to K-Dawg here at WICR, and, uh, we're going to be getting  back to more music and give it in about a little bit. 
[01:50:30]  But, uh, first we're going to get into a couple commercials, and then we'll be right  back with some more tunes.  We're going to be kicking off with some Judas Priest.  But, uh, so stay tuned.  Stay in there.  Any requests, 633-2369, this is K-Dawg, here at WICR, 610 A.M.  Oh, Paul.  Oh, he's, he's teasing the, uh, Million Man Youth March.  March.  He's going to have some comments about that. 
[01:51:00]  A little comments about it.  Very.  I'm assuming this is going to be the bit of the day.  You've been, uh, pushing it so much.  It's got to be some brilliant stuff, Scott.  I believe I did give good commentary on that.  All right.  Well, okay.  We're finished with the second break from the K-Dawg radio audition tape, Anthony.  You covered a lot of current events there.  Yeah.  The people on instant feedback are great, man.  Lawrence, Brooklyn, give him the overnights.  The way overnights. 
[01:51:30]  Marconi checking in.  I wish I never invented radio.  Another guy from Brooklyn saying, pathetic, just pathetic.  And Chris from Anglewood, call the dog catcher on K-Dawg and stuff a bone up his ass.  Well, let's go to the phones real fast.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Listen, I've got one question. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  The K and K-Dawg.  Yeah.  Is that short for Corky?  Thank you, Craig.  Totally out of control.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Rooney, New York City.  Waco is a current event.  In other news, Hitler catching some heat over that Holocaust thing.  John, what's up?  Guys, this has got to be a skit, right?  I swear to God.  No way.  I used to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I thought you guys picked on him too much.  Spaz, you're an idiot.  I am going to be hacking up the plan from laughing so hard. 
[01:52:30]  I swear it is, John.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's a rough draft.  Well, we understand that, Spaz.  That's why you came to us.  We're going to help you out with your next tape.  All right?  Okay.  Tony from Milford.  My wife is an Iona graduate.  She just threw away her diploma.  Thank you for proving Westchester Community College to be the premier higher learning institute. 
[01:53:00]  God, the listeners are great, man.  All right.  Spaz shouldn't be allowed to own a radio.  Tim, you've been waiting a while.  What's up?  Oh, guys, let me tell you.  This has been worth a half an hour away.  Oh, cool.  Spaz.  I always used to call you, Kevin, when you pick up the phone, now you're effing Spaz.  You know what he sounds like?  You take a 45 and you put it on 33 and a third.  Hi, guys.  The mad scientist in a Bugs Bunny cartoon?  The ether? 
[01:53:30]  Hello, rabbit.  Let me tell you.  Spaz, as a college graduate, oh, Jesus Christ.  God help my son.  All right, Tim.  Later, guys.  Bye.  The president of Iona College just threw himself on the tracks of Metro North.  And put Spaz in a traffic copter and shoot it down.  And I hate to say this, but we definitely got to take another break.  We've been talking for like a half hour.  We got the second half of the Spaz radio audition tape. 
[01:54:00]  I defy you to go anywhere.  Who the hell is going to change their dial at this point?  On the way, his commentary on the Million Youth March.  And the giant mosquito.  The giant mosquito.  It's one giant mosquito killing people in Queens, according to Spaz.  Yeah.  And he's got some tips on how to prevent getting bit by the giant mosquito.  Oh, there he is.  Whoa, there he is in Astoria. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Just trudging up the van white.  I've got to take a leak.  I can't handle this, man.  All right, listen.  We've got to blow out some commercials.  Please stay right there.  We'll get into the second half of K-Dawg's audition tape to become a radio DJ.  I swear to God, if there's program directors from other radio stations listening, you're 
[01:55:00]  crazy not to hire this guy.  I'll pick him up in a second.  Hire him.  Put him up against us.  And see what happens.  All right, Ant?  All right.  Please don't go anywhere.  His commentary on the Million Man Youth March is priceless.  And wait until you hear how he pronounces what you get from the giant mosquito.  More to come with WNW.  Stay there. 
[01:55:30]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNW.  1027 WNW, The Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony, and Spaz is in the studio.  Yeah, we're back from the long commercial break.  Thanks for hanging in there for us.  I had to run out of here and take the wins.  If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of listening to Spaz's radio audition tape.  He gave us the tape on the way out last night. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Anthony and I, we decided we were really scared to play it.  We finally decided to play it when we were stuck in horrible traffic on the 59th Street  Bridge today.  We figured we needed a laugh, so we put in Spaz's audition tape.  I've got to say, thank God we were in traffic, that we weren't moving, because I swear I'd  have been into the East River.  Yeah.  I'd have driven off the bridge.  Right.  We were laughing so freaking hard, we forgot we were in traffic.  Should we maybe read a few emails commenting on K-Dog's audition tape opening? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, sure.  Go ahead, man.  All right.  Marianne, he sounds like special K-Dog.  Let's see.  Joe in Morristown.  Please, oh God, please don't let this moron breed.  Uh, Terry, the emergency broadcast system is funnier than Spaz.  Pete in Hicksville, call the cops on K-Dog so they can put him in the trunk of a car and  die.  Another one, Spaz is worse than the grease man. 
[01:57:00]  Uh, Matt in Ramsey, I guess doing a little imitation of K-Dog.  Hey, this is crap dog.  I'm an absolute idiot.  And Nat from, uh, Manhattan, you should feed Spaz to the giant mosquito so it can suck  the pus out of his head.  I want to stop listening, yet I'm deeply compelled.  I hope this doesn't cause a clot in my brain.  John checking in, tell Ralph Mouth not to give up his gig at Arnold's. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, man.  And we're also getting some faxes in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I can't handle it.  Remember, when you're breathing, you gotta go.  Um, Spaz, Million Man Ute March.  He sounds like Joe Pesci.  Ute March.  K-Dog has rabies.  Does he lick his own, you know what, during the breaks?  I bet he can't even get himself off in a closet. 
[01:58:00]  Does he sniff the asses of his guests when they head to the studio?  Thank you, Johnny.  Uh, tell a gay dog to give it up from Big John.  Sean in Jersey, uh, I think you finally found a worthy cause for all that muscular dystrophy  money.  We have to have a cure for whatever Spaz has before it spreads.  He's sadder than any drooling kid in a wheelchair any day.  Well, Spaz, people, um, commenting, but of course, they're not experienced.  Right.  In radio. 
[01:58:30]  They really don't know what they're talking about, Spaz.  So, uh.  They're just listeners.  Yeah, take that for what it's worth.  Right.  Uh, Rick, what's up?  Hey, you guys better not let Dave Herman or Gary hear this tape, because you guys will  be losing your jobs real quick.  Oh, we know that.  And you should just tell Kevin you should go at the cops with a hammer in the near future.  Thanks a lot.  You guys suck.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, bye.  Cool.  Uh, Wiggler.  Wiggler.  Yeah, guys, how's it going?  All right, what's up?  He has got to change from K-Dog to K-Rap. 
[01:59:00]  That's just horrible crap right there.  All right, K-Rap.  I tell you that the Budweiser ferret is more articulate than Spaz.  All right, K-Rap.  We're here.  We're here.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, bud.  You suck at it, especially Spaz.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Uh, Stephen, what's up?  Yo, I think, yo, Spaz, everybody's busting on him, but yo, he's got balls.  He's got, he's, he's enjoying himself there.  There he goes.  He really is good.  All right, good.  You know, I'd love to be in his shoes.  All right.  Oh, hanging out with Spaz, all them guys, you guys, you guys are the best. 
[01:59:30]  We love Spaz.  We're just giving him a little advice on his radio audition tape today.  Thank you, Stephen.  No problem.  All right, man.  One more call, and we'll get back to the audition tape.  James, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, he should either stick to changing tampons or doing gameplays or something,  but just get him off the radio.  What is up with that?  Well, he's learning.  He's learning.  He's horrible.  All right, James.  Spaz dogs.  Which K-Dog?  Spaz dogs.  Sounds better.  All right, cool.  Later.  Thank you. 
[02:00:00]  All right, are we ready to get back to the tape, Ant?  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  I want to refresh everyone's memory in case we're getting a bunch of new people checking  out the show today.  We are listening to Spaz, a.k.a. K-Dog.  That's his on-air name.  And, yeah, it's his audition radio tape.  And so far, we've learned on this tape that there's a giant mosquito killing people in Queens.  Whoa.  Yeah, there's a giant mosquito in Queens.  Don, I miss.  We also learned that Hillary Clinton is a carpet muncher. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I've heard in the news that she's a carpet bagger.  Yeah.  But, hey, carpet muncher, why not?  He had some comment about Janarino, but we're not really sure what it was.  And he's got, I guess the bit of the day is he's going to have some incredible commentary  on the Million Man Youth March.  Million Man Youth March.  Million Man Youth March.  But he's convinced that everyone was rioting in Harlem as they were listening to his radio show. 
[02:01:00]  Did I summarize good enough, Ant?  Yeah, I think you did a great job.  Okay.  Please forgive me.  Too much oxygen to my brain.  Okay.  From laughing too hard.  All right, so let's get back to the audition tape.  This is break three.  I think, finally, are we going to listen to your commentary on the Million Youth March?  Yes.  Million Man Youth March?  Million Man Youth March.  Okay, let's get back to K-Dog.  Yeah, run for your lives.  Absolutely.  K-Dog.  This is K-Dog here in New York.  All right, what happened there? 
[02:01:30]  What happened there?  K-Dog?  I don't realize it's K-Dog.  I didn't know that the CD was going to continue.  I didn't know how to change the continuous single on that CD player.  How did you handle that?  Let's hear how he handled that.  All right, you want me to go back in?  All right.  I think he panicked.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right, here we go.  All right, sorry about that.  Here we go.  Listen, he forgot to turn off the CD player. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, run for your lives.  This is K-Dog here in WSDR.  Whoa.  Look at that down there.  This is K-Dog here in WSDR.  It's 10 a.m.  And Jeff Flanagan will be running to the Continental Airlines Arena as he was the 10th caller and he won those Black Sab tickets.  So Black Sab, that's pretty hip.  Yeah.  All right, rock on, man.  Black Sab.  So congratulations, Mr. Jeff Flanagan. 
[02:02:30]  All right, of dear old Iona.  Anyway, let's get some news that's going around today here on a Saturday.  All right, here comes some more news.  All right.  F-Tom broke off.  I mean, spaz is news.  Oh, wait.  Dan, there's a guy on the line that says that he sees the giant mosquito.  Oh, he hung up.  He hung up, bud.  Maybe he had a run from the giant mosquito.  Yeah, he'll call back, I'm sure. 
[02:03:00]  All right, here we go with the K-Dog's audition team.  Weekend shift here.  WSDR, 16 a.m., phone number 633-2369.  Wait a minute, spaz.  K-Dog, pardon me.  Excuse me.  That meant no disrespect.  That's all right.  Shouldn't, if you're giving out, whether it be the calls of the station or the phone number,  shouldn't you be articulate?  Shouldn't you let the people hear it?  You're kind of rambling.  Hey, K-Dog, it's a man, one, two, five, six. 
[02:03:30]  Like, you can't even tell what that was.  Play that little part back and you tell me if you can say what that is.  All right, here we go.  Doing the weekend shift here.  WSDR, 16 a.m., phone number 633-2369.  Like, everything just blends into a, it's just because I'm used to saying it.  But, hey, who am I?  Adam, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Well, I was wondering, I know where K-Dog got his name.  You've been watching too much wrestling, spaz.  I was wondering where Conan from WCW went. 
[02:04:00]  I was wondering next if you're going to be using Spaz Hogan.  No.  Wait, you got your name from an ex-wrestling guy?  Are you a K-Dog wannabe?  No, it's not that.  He happens to have the same name.  I just picked that name out of the blue because I had another name which I didn't particularly like.  Macho Man was already taken.  No.  I had another name, but I didn't want it anymore, so I chose that one.  What?  Howard Stern?  No.  The name I had before K-Dog was Dr. K. 
[02:04:30]  Dr. K.  Yeah.  That's good.  The doctor is in.  Yeah, baby.  K-Dog.  He's got your prescription.  The K-Dog, Jesse James.  Oh, you didn't know?  All right.  Hold on.  John has a comment.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Listen, I just want to tell you, the tape would sound better if you played it backwards.  Demonic messages.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Let's get back to the tape because this is another current events break. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Why are you turning so red over there, Spaz?  You all right?  Yeah.  All right.  My head hurts.  All right.  Here we go.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Do we show me what?  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  And I'm looking here at the article that the Million Man Youth March, and it's been amazing.  Now, if you're looking at the article, can't you see it just says the Million Youth March?  There was the Million Man March, which was down in D.C.  Yeah.  And then there's the Million Youth March, which is up in Harlem.  Yeah.  See, if you're a man, you can't be a youth.  Right. 
[02:05:30]  Or a youth.  So I said it wrong.  As you say.  Okay.  Million Man Youth.  Woman March.  All right.  It happens.  All right.  It happens time and time again.  Million Man Youth March, and there's been a million prayers being said for peace as  Muhammad Khalid will be marching.  Oh, no.  He's marching.  You could say Muhammad, Khalid, or his name, Khalid Muhammad.  Oh.  See, you kind of got his name backwards.  There, dog K. 
[02:06:00]  My apologies to Mr. Muhammad.  You're really not sure what his name is, right?  I did read the article before I did this.  Well, didn't you see his name?  Yeah.  I thought I read it as Muhammad Khalid.  What do you have, Listexia?  There might have been a comment there.  I just didn't see it.  All right.  Let's go.  I don't think so in the newspaper.  All right.  Let's move on.  This is his commentary about the Million Man Youth March.  Read it in a minute.  As Muhammad Khalid will be marching, actually, he's marching right about now, and last year 
[02:06:30]  there was only about 6,000 marchers.  This year, it's going to be, well, according to him, slightly more.  He went through two courts, actually, to get this okayed as the city tried to shut the rally  down because of Khalid's racist remarks.  In my opinion, I think that it shouldn't happen, but my opinion doesn't apparently count.  I'm just one of the masses here in the city of New York. 
[02:07:00]  Masses?  So why don't you think the Million Man Youth March shouldn't take place?  Yeah.  Because the guy is a racist joke.  Why should people follow his message?  You mean racist?  Like, did he say anything like they'd be rioting up and all?  No, it's just...  No, it's just that...  All right.  Yeah, I have to agree with him.  The grease man likes the K-dog.  Yay!  The color's a problem, a problem, snarlings, right, K-dog?  It's the grease man with the K-dog. 
[02:07:30]  What a doodle, yadda-deedle.  What a doodle-deedle-do.  Yeah, we hate the colors, don't we, K-dog?  It's K-K-K-dog.  What a doodle.  Look at his hood.  What a doodle.  Snarlings, bone dry, yeah.  Grease man with the K-K-K-dog, yeah.  What a doodle.  Yeah.  Me and the K-K-K-dog, we don't like the Jews either, eh. 
[02:08:00]  And the chinks, eh.  What a doodle.  I am not racist.  So you don't agree with...  Neither am I, yeah.  So you don't agree with Mohammed Khalid's message of hate or...  Hate and violence, I don't believe in violence, okay.  All right.  All right.  That's good.  Okay, here we go.  Anyway.  Anyway.  You had a much will be happening, and then you had to find somebody, you know, you're a winner. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my head.  And you got more and some feedback on there.  There we go.  Punch it up.  Holy Christ.  It is...  Oh, my God.  It is priceless, man.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Did WNEW hire Spaz strictly for entertainment purposes, or do they actually think that he 
[02:09:00]  could intern for this radio station?  The only great justice that could be done is if the giant mosquito flies up his ass and  explodes.  He is absolutely horrible.  I'm embarrassed to be a communications major listening to this, guys.  I can't believe how bad this guy is.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Thank you very much.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Rob from Brooklyn checking in, Opie.  In other news, the giant mosquito ate Mohammed Khalid while K-Dog made a mess on Hillary's  munched carpet. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  Anyway, let's get back to the tape.  Chris, real quick, saying Spaz really shines when he reads from the newspaper.  And I guess he breaks up his stories by using the term anyway.  Here we go.  Anyway, but yet much will be happening.  It is happening right about now.  I wonder how it's going.  And the police did promise to, well, be in less amount of force this year, basically. 
[02:10:00]  What it is, is that they're going to have 1,500 less officers there to close down the  rally this year.  There's going to be no ride gear, no helicopters swooping in to tear up the place.  And the cops tore up the place last year.  Is that what they did?  You might as well just tell the people that the cops are going to keep their fire hoses  at home.  I was looking for a phrase to say, and that's the first thing that came to mind.  All right.  Let's move on.  Yeah, that's basically it. 
[02:10:30]  So I hope the courts are happy, and it'll be their fault if something happens.  Yeah, that's what I say, yeah.  It's bound to be bad if there's black people there.  Yeah, you got to do it to the grease man here with the KKK dog, yeah.  So it's the courts fall out.  Are you an American?  Are you from this country?  I can't believe you're more offensive than the grease man. 
[02:11:00]  Do you understand they do have the right to have this march?  Yes, but it is American.  Most people don't agree that he had the march, but it's up to the courts to defend that.  Right.  Well, it's called freedom of speech, you idiot.  I know, but Giuliani fought it.  All I'm saying is that if they promote hate and violence, and that's what happened last  year, why would the court...  I want to promote hate and violence.  I don't want anyone else promoting it.  No, why would the court allow history to repeat itself?  Yeah, they do. 
[02:11:30]  I agree, yeah.  I agree, yeah.  If it's brown, keep them down, yeah.  That's what the grease man says.  And the KKK dog, yeah.  All right.  Are we almost done with your commentary?  I'm dry, yeah.  With a million-man youth march fast, that's the end of the...  Now we're up to the mosquito.  On the giant mosquito.  Oh, it's going to the giant mosquito.  Yeah.  Hold your hats, people.  That's just my opinion.  If anyone wants to call me up at 633-2369 to refuse his opinion, I'd be happy to...  Call you up.  I'll kick your white ass, brother. 
[02:12:00]  I will kick your white ass.  I didn't mean it for all blacks.  I just meant people who follow his message.  Oh, here he goes with his shovel.  Digging deeper.  All right, very good.  I mean all blacks.  All right, we got all...  I'm friends with a lot of...  We got to get...  A lot of them.  A lot of them.  I like those people.  I'm friends with those human beings.  Yeah, don't you know you?  How do I phrase it?  I'm not a racist, but... 
[02:12:30]  I'm not.  All right, I got a hint for you.  Apologitory.  Apologitory.  All right, let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we got a mosquito going around killing people.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, a giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge.  Oh, ho.  Giant mosquito.  They're convinced that's one mosquito, and they're trying to find this one mosquito. 
[02:13:00]  No, what I meant was, there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So, a giant mosquito breed.  What?  Next thing you know, he's going to say there's a bunch of chinks running away.  Could you name all the different mosquito breeds?  Yeah.  I know...  I can look at pictures of them and...  Yeah, pictures are good.  I like our pictures.  Whoa.  He has the, uh...  Going on his centerfold. 
[02:13:30]  All right, listen.  Field and stream.  All right, listen.  This gets really good.  I'm going to have to...  Let's let the tape ride.  All right.  Here we go.  Holy Christ.  The giant mosquito in Queens, killing people.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we got a mosquito going around killing people.  Apparently, it affects your immune system in your brain.  It inflamed, it's called...  I can't even pronounce this.  Here it goes.  Encephalito.  Anyway, it's...  Encephalito. 
[02:14:00]  Encephalito.  Look at how hard it's at.  Encephalito.  I don't know.  Encephalito.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone.  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it.  All right.  Someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude, I was laughing so hard, I just started dry heaving. 
[02:14:30]  Giant mosquito.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant mosquito.  Look for the giant mosquito story.  I'll take a picture of the giant mosquito story.  Rick, eagerly looking for the giant mosquito story.  I can't even pronounce this.  Encephalito.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right.  All right.  I got it.  I got the word in front of him.  All right.  Go ahead.  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death feared from...  Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name. 
[02:15:00]  Encephalitis.  You get your ass over here.  You'll sit the spatula and the boris the inside.  Encephalitis.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, I was driving home down the southern state, and I saw the big mosquito behind me.  I got really scared.  I sped up, but he came up alongside me, and he just wowed me.  I couldn't believe it.  He had a big KKK dog t-shirt on. 
[02:15:30]  I was stressed.  I couldn't believe it.  I was shocked.  Very cool.  That'll shock you.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  Encephalitis.  All right.  Let's get back into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  That's what happens.  That the mosquito is carrying.  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get.  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two. 
[02:16:00]  Then you're in paralysis, and then could die.  Coincidentally enough, it's the same thing that happens when I'm listening to K-Dog.  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  Scott Herman's in here, our boss.  Scott, have you been listening to the audition tape of K-Dog?  No, I didn't.  Oh, you're missing all the fun today.  Can I hear it?  Can I hear it?  I'm a little scared to play it for you, because we want our jobs. 
[02:16:30]  We don't want you taking K-Dog and putting him in our time slot.  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right, let's get back to the tape.  These are the symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Residents are being sprayed.  The residents are being sprayed.  What?  Dude, but they're spraying.  They're spraying, like, sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush. 
[02:17:00]  Not the people.  Damn you!  It's a madhouse!  So you think they're just running around with this spray and spray of people as they're going about their business?  Soakers full of DDT.  No.  There were tables set up with officers in, like, that, you know, outbreak suit.  And they had, like, cutter and off.  They were just spraying people as they walked by the table. 
[02:17:30]  That's the picture I saw.  Oh, my God.  If I just, like, if I just, like, cracked his head open right now, would I be charged with anything?  Or would it be a public service?  It's just scary.  All right.  Listen.  It's just so all throughout.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get back to it.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Now, actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with this mosquito in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito? 
[02:18:00]  You know, there he tried to say, what's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like you're from another country, you know?  I'm going to pee myself, I swear to God.  Encephalitis, where's Bactine?  Where's your sister Bactine?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large, giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens.  He's just walking around with bug spray. 
[02:18:30]  Spraying the residents.  In Queens, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks when outdoors.  Use insect repellent that includes DEET, D-E-E-T.  Avoid the outdoor activity from dusk to the door.  Remove water from cars and jars, because that's where miscues later eggs and, you know, settled water.  And check your home for tight-fitting screens indoors.  Much like the rules of going out there in the summer, you know, don't wear heavy clothing, don't let 100s get a heat. 
[02:19:00]  This is common sense, people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense.  I am stupefied, man.  It's common sense, people. 
[02:19:30]  Follow it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on here.  People should know these things anyway, but, of course, we've got morons on the TV and, like me on the radio right now,  that's telling you all the preventing causes to do.  Anyway, we're going to get right back to music.  And we're going to kick it off.  Actually, it would have been a Ren Stronstein.  It's Duhast.  Yeah.  Anyway, we've got some more news on the way we're going to talk sports after this next song break. 
[02:20:00]  There's Duhast.  We're WICR.  We're going to be great.  New grad.  And welcome.  That was good.  I hit the note.  You know, I hit the post.  That's a nice segue from Encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  Ricky, what's going on?  Yo.  What's up?  Yeah, I just saw this giant mosquito.  He made his way up to Harlem.  He was giving Mohamed Khalid a rusty trombone, man. 
[02:20:30]  I tell you, it was the weirdest looking thing.  This guy's just a dope, man.  Get him off.  Actually, no, he's hysterical.  Man, this is great.  Keep it up, guys.  All right, Ricky.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Patrick, Mount Vernon, saying, those infected can get a slight case of death.  Well, we do have more.  Oh, I can't wait to hear more.  Come on.  Do you want a few more? 
[02:21:00]  Got to hear a little more.  We have a sports break.  Sports.  Well, that's maybe where his strength comes in.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  I'm sweating.  I've been laughing so hard.  I started dry heaving.  I haven't laughed that hard in years, K-Dawg.  Thank you.  People saying, stop.  I can't see.  I'm laughing so hard.  Please, please stop.  All right.  I think we'll play one last bit of K-Dawg's radio audition tape after these. 
[02:21:30]  All right, Ant?  All right.  It's 1027-WNEW.  Oh, what?  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Oh, yeah.  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Oh, yeah.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  Joe, Pete, Anthony, and K-Dawg in the studio.  Well, we're thrilled to have K-Dawg here with us.  You might know him as Spaz. 
[02:22:00]  We've been going through his radio audition tape here.  Yeah.  And I just can't get enough.  It's like an accident.  It is like a damn car wreck.  I can't get enough.  The people are just speaking out in droves here.  Yeah.  I'll be instant feedback.  Joe from the Bronx.  I guess I have some advice for Spaz.  Welcome to McDonald's.  K-Dawg here.  Drop a dime.  Let me know how I can help you. 
[02:22:30]  And Jimbo from this concert, I'm going to stab myself in the ears with a sewing needle.  And then somebody else, I guess, wondering what you meant about what breed of mosquito is spreading.  What's the disease?  Let me get the word out.  Encephalitis.  Oh, that was close.  Encephalitis.  There you go.  Encephalitis, Encephalitis, whatever.  I said, breed of mosquito.  What's he talking about?  What breed of Down syndrome does he have?  I have terminal depression, and I'm laughing my ass off. 
[02:23:00]  I feel better for myself because life could be worse.  I could be Spaz.  Jeremy.  Michael from Glendale, Queens.  I'm going to answer feedback.  My cab driver, Mohamed Mobik Jambu, Minko Gertisman, didn't charge me for the ride because he was laughing so hard.  He can't believe how bad K-Dawg speaks.  Well, there you go.  Hey, dog.  I think we've got the last part of his audition tape here. 
[02:23:30]  Joe, what's going on real fast?  I've got to tell you guys, listening to Spaz explain himself is even funnier than listening to the tape itself.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my Lord.  Spaz, you're an idiot.  You're just an idiot, bro.  Thank you.  No problem.  No, thank you.  This has to go on your greatest hits tape, guys.  Yeah, watch out for that giant mosquito if you're in Queens.  Oh, got him.  Oh, definitely.  All right.  I've got the big can of off.  All right.  Good.  Thank you.  All right, Ant.  I think we're moving into a sports break here. 
[02:24:00]  He's coming out of music.  He's excited.  He's in the middle of his radio show, and here we go with K-Dawg's radio audition tape.  Yeah.  I am the super beast.  Hey, dog, here in the WRC.  Our 670 Amount of College Radio, phone number 633-CD69, the CD for compact disc, and 69  for someone's lucky number every seven seconds according to statistics.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  What were you trying to say there?  That's another catch coin phrase I had in college. 
[02:24:30]  I said, hey, our last four.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  You have some of these wacky catch phrases.  What's the first one when you want someone to call you at your radio show?  Drop it down.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Okay.  And what's your second one?  The other one is that the last four numbers of our station number is 2369.  So I say a CD69, a CD for compact disc, 69 for someone's lucky number every seven seconds  according to statistics. 
[02:25:00]  Statistics.  Statistics.  I think you said statistics, but, and what does that mean?  That somebody's in a 69 every 23 seconds?  No.  Every seven seconds, someone is possibly having sex.  So what does that have to do with 69?  69 is a sexual position.  Yeah, but does that mean that they're having a, like, everybody having sex is still in a 69?  They could be, if they're lucky. 
[02:25:30]  That's deep.  Uh, Rob, what's up?  Yeah, I just spotted, uh, you know, that giant mosquito.  Yeah?  Flying over Flushing.  Hundreds of Japanese people are taking bullies of it.  In fact, here comes Montra now.  Montra's doing some skyrides saying it's Spaz is a jerk.  Uh-oh.  And now here comes Godzilla.  Oh, he's spraying DDT out of his chest.  I can't believe it. 
[02:26:00]  The people are going nuts.  Just find one of those men that is walking around spraying people with bug spray.  You'll be okay.  Later.  Thanks, Rob.  Holy cow.  All right, let's go.  We've got to move on to other stuff on the show today.  We've wasted an hour and a half on this already.  Statistics, I should say.  Anyway, I keep forgetting to turn that off every time I play it on that CD.  Station equipment, got to get it fixed.  Anyway, looking at the box.  We have to play around the equipment.  And the Mets lost last night a heartbreaker in the 10th, 5-2 against the Rockies. 
[02:26:30]  As the bullpen just blew it.  The Mets actually last month were in first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.  But then that dwindled because Atlanta won a 10-game win streak.  It doesn't have to blow.  So then the Mets were stuck to 4-1-1.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it blows.  I've got to give it to him.  You've got to get a lot of credit.  You know, there's sports.  That blows. 
[02:27:00]  I say that all the time.  Yeah, when my Giants lost, yeah, that blows.  Mets lost a heartbreaker in the National League baseball thing on the planet Earth in our universe.  Well, you've got to get the little details out.  Yay, right here in the northern hemisphere of this great planet we call Earth in the solar system. 
[02:27:30]  Right?  Spinning around the sun.  The Mets.  Lost one.  Well, K-Dog, I think you could team up with Mad Dog and you guys would have a great sports set.  Mad Dog and a K-Dog.  K-Dog and a Mad Dog.  Yeah, K-Dog.  What do you think of the Yankees' chances here?  Going on away.  I don't like the Yankees.  I don't like them either.  I like the Giants.  Boy, you're stupid. 
[02:28:00]  I never knew there was somebody that couldn't speak worse than me.  I can't even say to our router.  At least I can say encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  Comes from a mosquito.  A bunch of mosquitoes.  Not a big giant mosquito, you frickin' idiot.  I got a K-Dog.  He couldn't.  And now he's words from a router. 
[02:28:30]  Encephalitis.  Ain't that right, Maggie?  I can't even speak.  I can say it.  The idiot's got the words spoken out right in front of him.  One of the few diseases that are spelt phonetically.  No wonder I got so far in radio. 
[02:29:00]  Mushmouth over here.  He's got a gig.  In the business.  There's probably some poor sap somewhere in the Midwest.  Got a booming voice.  Sounds like a testicle the size of happening apps.  Could be doing voiceover, making millions of dollars.  Never got a chance to go on the radio.  And we got a Swiss cheesehead. 
[02:29:30]  He's got a gig.  He's got a gig, Maggie.  The Mets losing is a heartbreaker.  This is a heartbreaker.  I'm ready to quit the business.  I'm going to become a speech therapist.  Might as well.  What the hell?  If this tool could be a DJ, it's a man, Maggie.  That's right, Doc. 
[02:30:00]  I'm hanging out with the dogs, Mad Dog and K-Dog.  Mad Dog and a K-Dog.  I'm a fan.  Can you remember that, the fan?  It's a K-Dog, aren't you?  Hey, where the hell am I?  I got a fan.  All right, we're in the middle of K-Dog's sports break here.  Mad Dog.  What next, Martian soccer?  What are you going to comment on?  Something on this planet?  Or your home planet of Tatooine? 
[02:30:30]  Where the hell are you from?  You're a freaking alien.  It's got to be camping from Earth.  Let's go to him.  He's from the same planet that brings you the giant mosquito.  Giant mosquito?  It's a big swarm of mosquitoes, you friggin' idiot.  It's going to sound like there's one mosquito with a derby and a cigar sticking out of his mouth.  Rousting people for change. 
[02:31:00]  Mad Dog, would you like to hang for this sports break?  I would like to listen to his sports expertise.  All right, here we go.  We got an expert in the studio to help you further along here, K-Dog, with your radio edition tape.  It's the National League, but then that dwindled because Atlanta won a 10-game win streak. 
[02:31:30]  There's an F below.  So then the Mets are second four and a half years behind as they play the Rockies tonight, actually.  A lighter going against Bohannon.  And the Yankees lost.  Dropped one to the Angels, 8-2.  As Andy Pettit having a really tough season this year.  I don't know, Andy Pettit's a man in the Yankees, so I don't really give a, you know, a rat's patoot.  He doesn't like the Yankees.  He's telling everyone he doesn't like the Yankees, Anthony.  I despised him. 
[02:32:00]  But that's his strategy.  He figures he doesn't like the Yankees, so he's not going to let anybody hear about how the Yankees did.  So he'll lull him off to sleep with his delivery.  Anyway, I hate the Yankees, so I don't really give a, you know, a rat's patoot.  Patoot.  I hate the Yankees, you know, for the Yankees.  But my picks are still the Mets to win the Eastern Division.  For the Central, I would have to say Houston.  And for the West, I'm going with Arizona.  For the American League, I want Boston. 
[02:32:30]  It's not going to happen.  But I'll pull for them anyway.  Boston for the American League East.  Cleveland to Central.  And I'm pulling for Oakland for the West.  And for the wild cards, I'll say National League.  Cincinnati will get it.  And I'm thinking that the American League, I'm going to have to say Texas.  So I'm going.  Write these down.  Yankees and Braves are not going to make the pen a race.  Call it an outside limb.  I know people have not.  Call it an outside limb?  I accidentally used two phrases in the same juncture. 
[02:33:00]  What were you trying to say?  You're basically saying that the Yankees and Braves are not going to be in the playoffs, right?  Yeah, I was going out on a limb.  Do you realize there's going out on a limb and there's an outside chance?  Yes.  That's what I was trying to say.  I thought you were going on a whim.  Oh, you could go on a whim.  Out on a whim.  I used two phrases at the same time.  I don't know.  All right, so the Yanks and Braves are not going to make the playoffs.  They realize there's only like three weeks left in the season,  and they're pretty much going to make the playoffs. 
[02:33:30]  Miracles do happen.  Yeah.  I don't like the Braves.  Unfortunately, one didn't happen right here.  I know people knocking on the door, pounding on the door, saying,  What is up with you, K-Dog?  My friends, they've hit me over the head with papers and other crap,  just because of comments I made about the baseball situation.  That's what I'm saying.  It's nothing to do with baseball.  The Yanks and Braves will not make it to the penalty race.  You know, the time is up, I think.  I think it's time for the Mets and the Indians to move on in the World Series. 
[02:34:00]  Anyway, so that's the case with baseball.  But as it stands now, some of my predictions are true, some are not.  But we'll see if season ends.  Anyway, Lady Liberty, they're the game behind in the WNBA playoffs.  And we'll see how that goes in the future.  But we've got one last song set to go.  Spastradamus.  In the future.  He's making predictions at Spastradamus. 
[02:34:30]  He's one of my quatrains.  All right.  All right.  And we're going to kick it off with a little bit of Butthole Servers.  I'll have a ton of voice there in a second.  Anyway, we're going to be getting back to more music.  Here is the Butthole Servers.  Ew.  Getting a little spice to an afternoon snack downstairs with Peppa.  Here at WRC, 6am, on the College Radio.  633-2369. 
[02:35:00]  That was a hell of a sports break.  You've got to give him credit.  For a frigging retard team to be able to say things like Yankees, Atlanta.  Then you've got to give him credit.  Obviously, he doesn't have a brain.  Obviously, there's nothing in there.  All right.  We have finally reached the last break of K-Dog's radio show.  Here it is.  He's wrapping up his little show here. 
[02:35:30]  He's going to go away mad.  Anyway, speaking of going away, it's K-Dog.  It's about time for me to go back to the kennel, so to speak.  You forgot to turn off the CD player again.  Yeah.  As I go off to the kennel.  I like that.  Back to the kennel.  Back to the kennel.  That's cute.  Please have this dog destroyed.  Back to the gas chamber.  He should be euthanized.  I can't take it. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Let's wrap this up.  Back to the kennel.  Anyway, that was Motley Crue with Don't Go Away Mad.  Before that was Offspring with The Kids Aren't Right.  That explains why I'm so screwed up in the head.  Anyway, up next is Nelspawn.  He'll keep up with this rock and metal format as he'll play his favorite metal and rock tunes here on WICR 6 and AM. 
[02:36:30]  Don't forget about our WICR big-ass bash one week from tonight, as a matter of fact.  Kick it off at 8 p.m.  And Old Dool's just around the corner on, actually, on North Avenue.  That's right.  Old Dool's on North Avenue.  615 North Avenue, to be exact.  And we'll be having a party there all night long.  It's 21 to enter.  No, it's 18 to enter.  21 to drink.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, time for me to go. 
[02:37:00]  Wait, did you say 21 to enter?  18 to drink?  I almost said that.  Old Dool's on North Avenue.  615 North Avenue, to be exact.  And we'll be having a party there all night long.  It's 21 to enter.  No, it's 18 to enter.  21 to drink.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, time for me to go.  And, wow.  Anyway, I'll be back again one week from today.  Kick it off again at 4 o'clock with more of your favorite tunes. 
[02:37:30]  Keep the requests rolling in at 633-2369, and I'll see you next week.  Here's my final song as I head out.  No pun intended.  And here's Guns N' Roses with Night Train.  Wait, wait.  Why would head out be a pun?  A pun with the song.  You know, I'm heading out on the night train.  There he goes.  Heading out.  There goes K-Dog. 
[02:38:00]  Back to the kennel.  On the night train.  Back to the kennel.  Well, that was...  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Somebody tell Spaz it's butthole surfers, not butthole servers.  Swervers.  I mean, an ounce of pronunciation.  You have an ounce of talent.  One ounce of talent. 
[02:38:30]  Well, maybe...  Maybe the answer in the phone.  Maybe Spaz is a butthole server.  You see, one guy likes your catchphrase.  Just drop a dime and Spaz will enter from behind.  Frank, what's up?  Dude, how long was the umbilical cord wrapped around his throat?  Oh, God's sakes.  Lucky he made it, I guess.  Hey, and the Yanks and the Braves aren't going to make it to the pennant race.  What are they in right now?  Come on.  They ain't going to make it. 
[02:39:00]  They're not going to make it into the playoffs.  No, he said they're not going to make it to the pennant race.  Oh, okay.  I screwed up, all right?  I'm at the playoffs.  Look at that.  Oh, he's just exhausted.  Jeff, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, could you please neuter the K-Dogs?  And he can't breathe?  I mean, Jesus Christ.  This is worse.  My IQ is through the f***ing floor.  I'm sitting here drooling over myself.  I'm wearing my f***ing hockey helmet.  Oh, look, dude, you can't say the F-word. 
[02:39:30]  You can't curse.  We had to dump on you twice, but we get your point.  Thank you, John.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  See you.  Mike, what's up?  Where did he go to college, just kidding?  Iona.  Iona.  I think they're going to take his diploma away.  They tried.  I mean, if anybody's listening to this show, he's retarded.  I just don't get it.  You guys are the best.  I did.  Thank you.  Bye.  Some guy wrote a whole news story about how the giant mosquito infiltrated the Million Man Youth March while Mohammed Khalid was performing the Rusty Trombone on Reverend Al. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, my God.  You make Stuttering John sound brilliant.  I swear to God.  Wow.  This is more disturbing than Robert De Niro's Rupert Pupkin character.  The fake talk show in The King of Comedy.  Oh, that movie's great. 
[02:40:30]  Andy, what's up?  You guys, you might as well quit after today because you're never doing anything funnier than this.  That's the best bit ever.  This could be the funniest stuff I've ever heard.  Ever.  Thank you, Andy.  Ladies, you guys, you've got it.  Kevin from the Bronx.  That sports report by Spaz was the most back-ass effing stupid attempt at sounding smart.  The Rangers have practically clinched for the playoffs, and there's no effing way the Yanks or the Braves will not make the playoffs.  Shoot him.  Shoot him now. 
[02:41:00]  That's why I said I was hoping for Boston.  It's not going to happen, but I pulled for him anyway.  What?  Is the Yankees going to get in a plane crash?  Are you hoping for a plane crash at this point?  It could happen.  Al, what's up?  Hey, maybe the mosquito is going to eat the Yankees.  They won't make it to the playoffs.  You'll probably get one of those electronic shot collars for the K-Dog here so you guys can zap his ass. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, we'll put up one of those.  All right.  Thanks, Al.  One of those fences where you put the wire in the ground so the dog just stops right at your property.  The invisible fence.  The invisible fence.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  I'd like to offer Spaz a job on my area of expertise.  Yeah.  I'd like him to come out of my clock every hour and go,  He's an idiot.  What's the matter with him? 
[02:42:00]  Well, as I read here, Opie,  Yeah.  Breaking news off the AP.  Hey, the New York Air National Guard announced that two of its F-16s have just downed what they believe to be a giant mosquito.  They say they used a DDT-laden Queens resonance strapped to a Sparrow missile.  Spaz, stick to Morse code.  That's James from Queens.  Wow. 
[02:42:30]  Well, Spaz, there you have it.  Your demo tape.  That was the fastest hour and a half ever.  Ever.  Great job.  Next time.  Now, that wasn't the polished version.  No, that was my very rough draft.  Maybe next time we'll get a polished version where you throw in some bumpers and stuff.  Can we bring you back in a couple of weeks to see how you progressed?  Yeah.  Okay.  You know?  That'd be good.  I have to lay down.  My head hurts.  We've got to find some Tylenol.  I've got to lay down.  All right.  Wow.  Mark, what's up? 
[02:43:00]  Hey, I want to know how to pass it off to Charlie Lewis Telefon and do that sports report.  I'm laughing at my choir, man.  I'm pissing.  Thank you, Mark.  You guys are great, man.  All right.  Bye.  See you.  Bye.  Bye.  Tonight's report, the giant mosquito has been plaguing Queens.  Obviously, this first reported by a crack news reporter, K-Dog, on the radio station, 
[02:43:30]  once in five seconds, makes your moment, as he so eloquently put it.  Even I, Tom Brokaw, can't speak very well, but I can say encephalitis.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  So pay attention, answer.  1027 WNEW.  Hopefully, you guys have recovered at least a little bit as we continue on with the worst of. 
[02:44:00]  If you've never heard that before, again, that's a...  We just call it spaz radio because it's just incredible.  Well, the funniest, probably one of the funniest things we've ever done here since we've been at NUW.  Anyhow, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  If you have any suggestions, we've got some time left in today's show.  For any bits you want to hear, 212-757-1027.  You can fax them in at 212-957-WNEW.  Or instant feedback, getting a ton of feedback off the instant feedback on the Internet. 
[02:44:30]  So if you've got any suggestions for today's worst of, and if I've got time, I'll definitely try and squeeze it in.  Uh, yeah, Coz.  We're going to do some Cozby, by request.  Dice.  When Dice is in the studio, by request, coming up in just a little bit.  And also, more Mike Tyson.  All right?  That's all on the way, including some other cool stuff.  So hang tight, enjoy, and here's some Ronald Reagan. 
[02:45:00]  Some of the latest news from his illness on the worst of O&A.  Do you like any of this crap?  It's the worst of O&A.  And it's 107-WNEW.  Uh, well, we've got some, uh, sad news.  This whole Reagan story is just getting more and more tragic every day.  It's, uh, pretty interesting.  Every couple of months, he's back in the news.  And, uh, boy, they just haven't found that cure where he's perfect and then fine again.  No, and they're not going to, it's just, uh, it's just a matter of time at this point. 
[02:45:30]  Well, Alzheimer's disease has robbed Ronald Reagan of his ability to speak.  Uh, he can't even talk now?  Now he can't even talk.  He's just slowly but surely deteriorating.  And now he has lost his voice, the ex-president of the United States.  Uh, but he can still smile.  Oh, great.  Okay, let me get this straight.  He goes from finger on the button, power to destroy all mankind.  That's when I was in high school.  Yeah, two, it's an accomplishment that he's smiling. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  Great, great.  Life rules.  Jesus Christ.  I try to visit every, every couple of weeks and we found he likes my bright red fingernails,  Reagan's oldest daughter Marine says.  Great.  She writes that in, uh, this week's Newsweek.  He looks at those nails and we get a big smile from the, from the man.  A big smile.  Right.  That's great.  Well, anyway, it's our lucky day once again.  I don't know how he's going to speak because the Alzheimer's has robbed the ex-president 
[02:46:30]  of his ability to speak.  Yeah, supposedly he can't even speak, huh?  So, uh, I mean, how are we even going to do this phone call?  Uh, I hear he's on line five right now.  Mr. Reagan.  Mr. Reagan.  Hey, Mr. Reagan, are you there?  Hello.  There he is.  Hello.  Hey, they said you can't speak.  Yes, I'm, I'm sorry.  The phone was ringing and I answered the cat.  Now.  Come on. 
[02:47:00]  That'll hurt.  No, no.  Old Ron can still talk.  Well, the, the, the papers are saying you cannot speak anymore because of the Alzheimer's.  No, I, I just want to, I just want to say I, I can still talk.  I choose not to, so I don't have to, well, talk to that big-headed stick figure, Nancy.  God damn it.  She's about the scariest friggin' thing to look at, isn't she?  That's so wrong.  A head like a cassava melon on a body only Karen Carpenter could want. 
[02:47:30]  Ah, come on.  God damn it.  Thank God for Alzheimer's.  Sometimes I forget I even banged the broad.  Hey, I'm a little leprechaun and I'm on Jupiter.  Hello.  Yeah, where are you at?  Yes, Mr. Gorbachev.  Yeah.  Tear off those clothes.  I, I always hated that damn spot on his head.  He'd be talking missiles and ICBMs and I'd be like, Jesus Christ, it's shaped like Nancy's big fat ass. 
[02:48:00]  Mr. Gorbachev, wash your head, you wooski.  Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black.  I ate my cufflinks and I'm a foghorn.  Woo, woo, woo.  Hello.  Yeah, we're here, Mr. Reagan.  Uh-oh.  What's up?  Here comes Nancy. 
[02:48:30]  I'd better start drooling.  Or I may have to stick it to that praying mantis balloon head bitch.  You know, sometimes I wake up screaming, just screaming.  Yeah.  I dream her huge head is calling me and wants sex.  Oh, my God.  God damn, I'd rather, ugh, I wouldn't do her with bonzo slong.  Oh, my God.  My ice cream's melting.  Yeah.  Yes, and it's all warm. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And it's in the back of my pants.  And it stinks.  Mmm, chocolate.  I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  Here's my handle and, well, my spout is soft all the time.  Look, my hands run backwards.  Once Barbara Bush hobbed my knob.  Oh, yeah?  What?  She hobbed your knob?  Who?  Barbara Bush.  She did?  Yeah.  That's what you just told us. 
[02:49:30]  Who?  You.  I should watch that old gag.  You.  I love Alzheimer's.  I don't have to be responsible for anything.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, what's wrong?  Here comes that friggin' Maureen.  Yeah?  That daughter of mine with those goddamn nails.  Well, it says in the paper you really like her red nails.  Why would they think that?  I don't know.  That's what she said, I guess.  Oh, I got the reason I'm smiling is because I remember banging 20-year-old Hollywood starlets 
[02:50:00]  with nails like that.  I miss that hose bag.  Well, she used to tickle my prostate with those nails.  Oh, yeah?  Now my prostate looks like a pineapple.  As does Nancy's big head.  Excuse me, could you do something?  Yeah, what?  I'll send the, uh, well, Secret Service away.  Yeah.  Shoot me.  Come on.  Would you please shoot me?  It can't be that bad. 
[02:50:30]  I'm sitting in my own crap.  Yeah.  And Nancy's huge head keeps peeking in on me.  Does it?  Like some distorted Mardi Gras float.  I was gonna say, does it still look like a Pez dispenser?  It's still, oh my God.  What?  It's awful.  Yeah.  And if she thinks I could talk, she tries to have sex with me.  Well.  So you have to go down below there?  Oh my God.  The only thing more horrible than her head. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Is that gas.  You should see it.  It's like nothing I've ever seen.  Well, what does it look like?  The horror.  Yeah.  The horror.  Just this empty, cavernous, dried-out hole.  Oh, man.  Nothing.  A void.  A vacuum.  Here she comes. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, keep walking, Twiggy.  Well, what does the gas look like, though?  Is she nice and trimmed down there?  You're a glutton for punishment.  Why?  For him, who could tell?  It's all gone white.  Fallen out.  She's bald down there.  Oh, yeah?  And to top it off, she's got that stain that Gorby had.  God.  It's all just a mess.  I'd rather not talk about it.  Okay.  Well, I didn't write any material on it. 
[02:52:00]  You'd have said you were, you know, going in that direction.  Perhaps, well, I'd have an answer.  Well, I figured you were flowing that you might be able to go there, Mr. Reagan.  No, I'm not flowing.  No.  Neither is she.  Very dry.  All right.  I can't even do this Ron impression with the short throat I am.  No, that sounds fine.  You ask.  Yes.  Okay.  Do you have any other jokes, Mr. Reagan? 
[02:52:30]  Let me look.  Okay.  Oh, not a one.  That's about it, huh?  Yes.  All right.  I'd better go now.  Okay.  Godspeed.  Tear down that wall.  All right.  There he is, everyone.  What?  No, there he goes.  The ex-president of the United States of America, Mr. Reagan.  President Reagan, everyone.  The words of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  We got the Kaz in the studio.  The Kaz.  And also, live from L.A., it's Jay Moore. 
[02:53:00]  Jay.  First weekly visit.  What's up, Jay?  I don't know how Kaz could be in the studio when he's here at my house.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's in the other room.  Kaz.  You're good.  Oh, no.  Put him on the phone.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pick up the light.  Now, I would like to talk to you about my penis.  Now, you take your hand and you place it below my belt. 
[02:53:30]  And you're drinking the stuff.  And it feels good.  And it's great to get.  And flizzing, flop, flizzing, bizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing.  Don't the piss back and forth.  And before you know it, flizzing, zizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing.  Flizzing.  Flizzing, flizzing. 
[02:54:00]  Flizzing, flizzing.  It seems to cause him a little bit of trouble there.  Flizzing, flizzing.  What's up, man?  Lachelle Covington, a 20.  That's been a rumor about Kaz for a long time.  What, that he likes grabbing girls' hands and shoving them down his pants?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Did you read the story in L.A., Jay?  No.  Oh, this is a great story.  I'm still on Comic Time.  I've been sleeping until once.  Oh, this is a great story.  Lachelle Covington, she's been on the Cosby Show a few times.  Lachelle.  It's Lachelle. 
[02:54:30]  Lachelle.  I don't know how to pronounce these names.  Lachelle.  She's got Ricky Lake with that name.  Lachelle.  Lachelle.  She's got Ricky Lake name.  Yeah, she's been on the...  Lachelle, when did you and Rat Tatooine know Latrine was the breeze baby?  Well, then I talked to Listerine.  Hold on, Kalua.  It's Portia's turn.  LaMangelo.  LaMangelo.  Anfernee, please.  Anfernee.  Anfernee.  What was the thing?  Well, she's an actress.  She's been on the Cosby Show, but she hasn't had speaking parts on the Cosby Show.  I wonder why. 
[02:55:00]  Well, she went to Cos's little house there.  Went to his posh townhouse.  To his townhouse to get some acting advice.  Acting advice.  From the Cos.  That seems a little strange right there.  That's the best.  She goes to his house for a little acting advice.  She's a hoo-er.  A hoo-er.  Well, she filed a police report saying the beloved comedian put her hand under his T-shirt  and guided it south toward his sweatpants.  That's a crime?  Built and far.  What law did he break? 
[02:55:30]  You see, the penis is below the belt line, so I only wanted her to touch my penis.  I put her hand on my belly bar.  I was hoping it would not stay where I put it.  What law did he break?  I was guiding her hand towards what I like to call Fat Albert.  Well, sometimes when I drink too much, he's Donald Donald.  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids hanging right below. 
[02:56:00]  I like to call my left nut Rudy and my right nut Bill.  Rudy hangs a little lower because he's sad about being below Fat Albert.  Pow!  If you're struck Rudy just right, the next thing you know, pow!  Fat Albert starts dripping and drizzling all over.  It's not my Huxtable. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, Jay, I think Cosby wanted to play What's in My Pants, huh?  Yeah, right.  I saved Polar with an afro, slightly shaved, and she dates a fireman because it has a brass knob.  And what law did he break?  Well, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, they decided no crime had been committed.  She pulled her hand away, and at that point, before that point, it was a consensual little circumstance. 
[02:57:00]  So the cops never questioned Cosby.  However, the story gets better there, Jay Moore.  Oh, now she's going to sue him.  In the upcoming issue of the National Enquirer, Covington's relatives are quoted saying Cosby went further grabbing her breasts,  trying to put his hand down her pants, and exposing himself to the young actor.  If that's the case, there's crimes going on on a daily basis right here in this studio.  I was just going to say that.  Anthony and I, it's alarming.  Anthony and I think of the same joke.  Like a 60% clip. 
[02:57:30]  And it's like just 50-50.  Who gets it out first?  It's alarming.  You want to hear more of the police report?  Because it is pretty funny.  But I don't understand.  Putting a woman's hand on your belly.  Putting a woman's hand on your pants.  You know how many times, you know what my trick was when you didn't think you were getting anywhere?  Yeah.  This works, guys.  Any guy listening, this is a great one.  There we go.  There we go.  More advice.  Batten down the hatches.  More advice.  M-O-H-R advice.  Okay.  Hey, come on.  This is the guy that came up with, I made two cousins kiss. 
[02:58:00]  Don't forget.  Absolutely.  We'll never forget it.  All right, when you're in the car making out, and you're like touching breast, and you're  not sure what's going to happen, and you just, you know, you could sit there until five  in the morning making out.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Yeah.  I mean, time, expedition is the key.  You want to be expeditious in the process of getting laid.  Right.  Because you're making out, and when you feel, don't just do it like right off the bat.  You got to get it like hot and heavy.  You touch the breast, tweak the nipples a little.  Then you take out, it's got to be erect, gentlemen.  Don't take out the acorn. 
[02:58:30]  Take out the rod.  Yeah.  And you just let them see it.  You say, what are we going to do about this?  When they see it, sometimes when they see it, it's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  They can't help it.  Yeah.  They're at least going to touch it out of curiosity, because they can't believe you.  The worst thing that's going to happen is they're going to make, you know, kick you  out of the car.  And then who wants to be able to do it anyway?  That's a break.  It's a problem, though.  What are we going to do about this?  That's a break.  Oh, look, you know what that's how you do?  You're like, oh, my God, look how excited you get me. 
[02:59:00]  You show them.  Oh.  It's like the compliment.  That's a brave move, Jay.  That is a bold move, man.  I'm telling you it works, because when they see it, well, not Rick, because he's an egg roll,  but when they see most, you know, nice, handsome, circumcised penises, you know, they like penises.  But if Rick takes out, like, an egg roll, they're going to be like, I don't know about  that one there.  Why don't you peel it yourself and get back to me?  I love the girls in the car.  You're making out with them and stuff, and you want to go for patch, and they have all 
[02:59:30]  those karate moves preventing you from getting down there.  Yeah.  I didn't realize their arms can move like that.  Yeah, it's like they do their special.  I've been on the road.  What are we going to do about this?  Now, enter the question, and I suppose, at about 1.15 a.m., what are we going to do  about my erect penis?  It looks like a Jell-O pudding pop, right?  Oh, there you go.  Why don't you treat it like what? 
[03:00:00]  Phil's barn and Phil's.  You're not fine.  Rudy never minded putting a hand on the cousin's pants during the cotton show.  Now, little Rudy.  Rudy.  What a great story in the paper.  Why did a 60-year-old girl have a mustache?  And Rudy had a little dirty Sanchez going.  I can't believe a 65-year-old man trying to get pussy is news. 
[03:00:30]  It's a 20-year-old chick, and he's, like, putting his hand down.  Yeah, but what else do you do when you're worth a billion dollars and you're 65 years old?  You'd think he could be a little smoother than that, though.  What's that?  He's in his swank townhouse in his big, stinky Cosby sweatpants.  Repeat that.  Repeat that.  With his big belly.  Repeat the first part of your sentence.  He's in his posh townhouse.  Yeah, she came to him.  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean, you can...  For acting advice.  You know what, though?  If he probably would have had just a tad more class, it would have worked. 
[03:01:00]  Like, like...  Kissed her on the mouth.  I don't know.  I don't know what to move it, but I don't think it's grab her hand and put it in your  pants.  Yeah, Jay, what's the move?  I told you what to move is you make out and it's fully erect.  Shake it out.  What are you going to do about this?  You're stroking it yourself and say, look how excited you make me.  What are we going to do about this?  It's crazy.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  I'm in pain.  I'm in pain.  What are we going to do about this? 
[03:01:30]  It just sounds like a problem.  It's so funny.  What are we going to...  Oh, look at this.  Geez, I've got to take this back to the shop.  What are we going to do about this?  No, then you start doing it yourself and they're like...  Then they feel stupid that they're just sitting there watching you masturbate.  Before you know it, it's tonsil hockey.  Shake it from the man.  Brilliant.  Brilliant move.  Somebody's going to try that move.  Bravo.  You know what's funny is Opie's going to try it on his girlfriend, like, where he doesn't  even have to try it.  What are we going to do about this?  Opie will be like making out tonight and just take it out and be like, oh, what are we 
[03:02:00]  going to do about this?  Put that away.  You're disgusting.  Put it in me.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I'm going to try the, what are we going to do about this line?  I encourage all our listeners to try the, what are we going to do about this line?  Yeah, try it.  Let us know how it works, you single dad.  It's got to be like, oh, my God, you're in so much pain because it's fucking out of  your pants.  Hold on.  This girl, Kelly, says this trick works.  Yes, see?  I'm going to put you on with Kelly, Jay.  Your hand is strong.  Kelly!  Yeah?  Hi, what's up?  Lovely.  Great.  It does work.  Really?  Because when you see a good-looking penis, you want to take care of it. 
[03:02:30]  It is so true, and I can tell you from experience, it's very true.  It has happened many times.  From the way you're talking, it sounds like you're doing one right now.  No, actually, right now, I'm on my way to work.  I'm going to, like, deep shit with my boss.  Oops.  Oh, watch that curse word.  Sorry, but I'm really...  Go cursing.  You can't curse.  You know.  Hey, Kelly, Kelly, what are we going to do about this?  I don't know.  I have to come visit.  I guess it has to be in the same room, right, Jay?  It works better when you're there with the person.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah?  Why does it work?  It's because you see it, and you're already excited, and there's the sight of it.  Make sure you want to do something about it.  If you're making out for, like, five hours, and you haven't done that yet, you're in serious  problems, okay?  But I'm thinking after an hour of making out, you should be doing it by then, okay?  Or less than an hour.  That's right.  Cool.  When you see it's fully erect, you almost feel guilty for the...  When the guy starts stroking it himself, you're going to be like, all right, get out of  the way.  Let me do it.  Well, you don't stop right away.  You talk to them for a real while. 
[03:03:30]  Chuck it up!  I'm going in!  It works, though.  All right, Kelly, thank you.  You're welcome.  Well, look at that.  How drunk was that girl?  This girl, Joanne, says that your trick works.  One more lady that says that Jane Moore's trick works.  You know, you guys didn't believe me when I unveiled the trick.  No, I didn't.  That's a ballsy move.  Joanne!  Hello!  Hi.  All right, Jay, that trick has worked so many times on me, it's not even funny.  Wow.  You know, tell everybody.  So many times.  Your uncles are going to start pulling it out. 
[03:04:00]  So, what, you're making out with a guy, you're getting hot and heavy, he pulls out his junk  and says, what are we going to do about it, and it works for you, huh?  And let me tell you, it's like, okay, I'll be a good girl tomorrow.  Wow.  You know, you go along, you're saying, I'm going to behave myself.  No, no, this is not going any further.  Yeah.  I'm going to remain calm.  We're just going to end the night nicely.  It's going to be good.  I'm going to be, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He takes it out, and the next thing you know, it's just irresistible. 
[03:04:30]  That's right.  It's a beautiful sight.  It truly is.  Some filth and flog.  I told you when they see it.  See, guys don't realize that it's actually an attractive thing to women.  It is a weapon.  Yeah.  Well, that was a storyline, episode 54, when I taught Theo that trick.  He went out and pulled out his stuff.  Filth and flog.  Put your hand down the big sweaty sweatpants of the cause, filthy farm.  I applaud the cause. 
[03:05:00]  I think if you're a billionaire, and you work as hard as he has, as long as he has, and a  girl comes to your house, and you put her hand on your belly, your big old belly, and  tell her to take care of some business, I think he's done nothing wrong, and I think  this country's gone bananas with the...  Where do you draw the line between sexual harassment and trying to get laid?  What if you're just trying to get laid?  Yeah, but you know something?  She came over to your house for acting advice.  She honestly knew what the deal was.  I'm just saying a little more couth. 
[03:05:30]  Maybe she didn't right away want to plunge down at his 60-year-old...  Couth, you know who needs couth?  Six-year-old...  How many poor guys need couth?  Melting Turkish taffy nuts.  And you're a secret-looking guy that has a billion dollars, you don't need couth.  You pull down your pants and go, hey, play with this.  I'm worth a billion.  I own the little rascals.  I own the little rascals.  I want you to grab my buckwheat.  You need...  Tymie.  Look, my little stymie is right here.  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.

Oh, and they will return on Monday, ready to rock, so be ready for them when they get back, all right?  But something by request a lot of people have been asking for.  Of course, we all know Anthony does a dead-on Dice impression,  and people have been asking about the time he was in the studio live, which happened about nine months ago. 
[03:07:30]  And hopefully he'll be coming back soon.  But in the meantime, here it is, when Dice met Dice.  On the worst of open, Anthony.  And now...  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  107 WNAW.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Entering Mr. O Anthony.  Where is he?  Whoa.  There he is.  He looks like...  Hey, Dice! 
[03:08:00]  What was that?  Get this over with.  What did that mean?  You're doing me a thing.  No, no, no.  We'll explain it.  See, he's a bastard.  He's an obnoxious bastard.  Okay, so who's the guy that does me?  Huh?  Do you?  I don't think I'm going to do you.  All right?  You know, that's not bad.  That's what you said last time I did you.  That's what you said last time.  Yeah, the only...  That's excellent.  That's even...  That's almost better than me. 
[03:08:30]  The only difference between you and me is about $35 million.  I hope you still got some of that.  Yeah, I got plenty of it.  Yeah?  That's why I could afford not to wear sleeves.  What's the matter?  Why are you tongue-tied?  Why are you off on the...  Is this the guy...  I thought we were getting along.  No, we are getting along.  But we got to have fun for the people in their cars going home that have been at work all 
[03:09:00]  day dealing with the Chinaman boss to listen to something.  Well, okay?  I got some clips of Anthony doing you.  Yeah, let's hear some.  You want to hear one?  Yeah, yeah.  When his badmouths you.  What?  Who's the...  Oh, see, he's very sensitive.  I don't badmouth.  He does...  It's an homage.  I think...  An homage.  What does that word mean, Kenny?  It means that he badmouths you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, when...  What did you hear?  You're playing chuckles for 15 people.  Oh, wait, I got...  Maybe that was my choice. 
[03:09:30]  And it wasn't chuckles.  It was Laugh Your Balls Off in Poughkeepsie.  No, I...  Chuckles?  I did two albums in front of 15 people.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  In Dangerfields.  But do you know how many people bought those albums?  How many?  I guess, Jerko.  A million.  Yeah, take a guess.  So you address me in the proper fashion, I'm not going to talk.  All right?  Well, I didn't mean anything by Jerkoff face. 
[03:10:00]  What did you mean?  That's like a compliment.  That's when you become friends.  All right, asswipe.  I can roll with that.  See, that doesn't hurt me.  No, I know.  That's like a nice thing for you to say.  You can wallow in your millions and you don't feel bad.  Because only buddies could talk like that to each other.  See?  Yeah.  I don't call the farmer, you know, J-O-Face.  He hasn't earned that from me yet.  He's going to be late right away. 
[03:10:30]  Maybe me and you could do a show like doing my twin or something.  Yeah.  Or he's not as handsome.  He could be the evil dice.  He's got the goatee ready.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  We do like a sitcom on some network that might have me.  The handsome dice and the retarded dice.  I guess you'll be playing the retarded dice there, Kenny.  Look.  Look at this guy.  What is with the hurt feelings all of a sudden?  Come on.  Hey, Kenny, I found the clip you were talking about.  Why?  Go ahead.  Let's hear it. 
[03:11:00]  I'm going to be at a laugh till you cropped your pants, coincidentally enough, in Allentown,  Pennsylvania.  Where did that come from?  No, what I like is coincidentally enough.  Because that's another word I don't understand.  It's never said.  That was never said, huh?  No.  So where are you performing this weekend?  Or in your bathroom alone?  Where are you performing?  I perform here all week.  Do you do stand-up comedy?  No.  Why would I want to travel the country?  That's why you jerk-off face. 
[03:11:30]  Staying in lousy hotels.  Well, I stay in the best hotels.  When you die.  Maybe back in 88.  Huh?  What now?  Holiday Inn, Best Westin.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit now.  Well, what's the matter?  Now it starts coming your way, and the nice man gets a little pissed off.  Wait a minute now.  Huh?  Huh?  Maybe if you find your own personality, you can make a living doing stand-up comedy.  Personality?  Personality. 
[03:12:00]  I mean, you got a good personality.  You got a good personality.  Let me hear you say that one.  Huh?  Say it.  I don't understand what you're saying.  You say to me, you got good personality.  Say that.  Just say that.  You got a good personality.  Personality.  I mean, you got a good personality.  Now, until you learn that, you really don't have the impression down.  So I'll try it too.  I don't think people are going to pay to hear.  You have to leave the...  No, no, no, no, no.  That's not what I said.  What you said, I have to leave the...  That's not what I said.  I said personality.  I mean, you got a good personality.  Now, I ask you. 
[03:12:30]  You got a good personality.  I mean, you...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Huh?  That's not what I said.  What I said is personality.  Personality means you got a good personality.  Guys, you're making no sense.  No, that makes no sense.  You babble.  I'm hearing...  I'm hearing babble.  No, what you're saying makes no sense.  What I'm saying is a statement.  Why is that dead air on the air?  Why aren't you talking now?  Talk to me when I talk to you.  Because I don't understand the word you're saying.  Personality means you got personal. 
[03:13:00]  You see?  Now, everybody driving in that car...  Spock, explain.  ...going, I understand.  How come Jerkoff face don't understand?  Again with the Jerkoff face.  I'll be on radio stations all over the country.  I'll promote Anthony Jerkoff face.  How's that going to feel?  I can't even do an impression of you because I haven't heard you yet.  I heard, uh, Opie...  How do you not kill your parents?  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:13:30]  107 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay and Kenny.  Love so to Kenny.  I hear you.  So, uh, you want to talk to some folks there, Dice?  That's up to you.  Yeah, what the hell?  Let's go.  John, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Yo, you guys are great.  Nice man.  I love you, but Anthony, man.  What?  What are you, a pussy?  What?  You're making fun of him for like a week and a half.  Now you can't say...  It's not making fun.  It's talking.  It's a parody, and I'm going to let it go. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, come on, talking.  Well, what did I do?  Let this guy talk.  What did he say that I should get mad at?  Because I don't get mad.  Wait a minute.  I don't get mad, so tell me.  All right.  I'll, um...  Well, we got some, uh, exams.  It's usually...  All right.  Hey, I sold our Madison Square Garden, huh?  They haven't called since, but I sold it out in record time.  All right?  You know, stuff like that.  The imitation...  It's nothing personal, Dice.  No, it's very flattering.  You're...  You're a character, you know?  Exactly.  You're a character. 
[03:14:30]  It's like I'm a walking cartoon.  That's what you're saying, right?  It's like I'm not even human.  I don't...  Yeah.  I'm a cartoon to you.  I'm a few laughs for you.  I'm not around, and you can just say whatever you want.  That's what this guy's saying.  You know, now I'm glad to hear you say it.  Say it again.  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem?  You know, between me and you.  Yeah, you jake off.  Huh?  I don't understand this guy.  What's wrong with these people? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, everybody's looking for a beating.  Well, I got more examples of Anthony.  Yeah, let me hear something.  Oh, Christ.  Come on.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  I ain't been funny since 86.  Now, that isn't even true.  Now, that isn't even true.  Now, wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  See, that was done with computer generation.  Look at me.  If we went in court of law, what was your answer just now?  That's not true.  That was computer generated.  You don't know how you feel about me.  As you, Anthony, for this person. 
[03:15:30]  First of all, I don't think you did the Rodney thing until maybe 87.  So, it's not even, like, logistically correct.  It's 88.  88.  Right, see?  That's right.  And you were hysterical.  Mr. Clay, I got another example for you.  Okay.  Hey, this is Diceman.  I used to be somebody.  Now, I can't even sell out a closet.  Hey, now, wait a minute.  Now, when was that?  That was before, Phil.  Before I went to Governor's and saw a packed club of raving fans. 
[03:16:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Before the night.  You see, I got to forgive him because of what he just said.  What?  What'd he say?  Well, he didn't.  Guys, you had disappeared for a while, okay?  You had.  To you?  You know something?  Yeah, to me.  I was a big fan.  Shut your mouth.  Kenny, when was the last special?  HBO special.  Assume the position.  When did it air?  Three years ago.  Okay.  What year was that?  Ninety-six.  Yeah, ninety-six.  Okay. 
[03:16:30]  You said eighty-six.  Yeah.  You said eighty-six.  Kenny, how many homes tuned in in nineteen ninety-six?  Ninety-five percent.  Okay.  Who's tuning in for you if you go on TV, Anthony?  Dice.  Your parents?  See, it wasn't Andrew Dice Clay.  It was the Dice character.  I'm mocking.  Oh, I get it.  It's a cartoon.  The cartoon guy.  It's like Fred Flintstone or something.  So you don't have another example, do you?  Oh, sure. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  Andrew Dice Clay, I'm available for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and sweet sixteens.  How did you know I was doing?  And I'm not even banging the broom.  Now, come on.  How did you know I was doing?  I'll show you a nice one.  That must be a treat, huh?  Hey, read the Torah, then come on.  See, he's an instigator.  I didn't say nothing, Mr. Clay.  Look, I...  You know the funny thing is that you...  You know the funny thing is about this whole little thing with him.  Yeah.  That he's calling himself Andrew Dice Clay.  No. 
[03:17:30]  And the other funny thing is...  Is I'm going to sue you.  No, no, this is what I'm leaning up to.  Don't give the punchline away.  When you use somebody's name, number one, like, that's called, like, um...  What is that word?  Infringement.  Infringement, that's one.  Defamation of character.  That's two.  Huh?  So here comes another $35 million from the station that hired you.  Now, we'll probably have to settle.  You'll probably lose your job and be with the hot dog stand downstairs. 
[03:18:00]  But I'm still going to love you because I know it's a goof.  Would you like another example?  Okay, let's take another...  Nah, you got one?  Contrary to popular belief, the Diceman can read.  Now, wait a minute.  Hold it, hold it.  Wait a minute now.  Here, here.  I'm going to read out of this, um...  This educational magazine I'm looking at with a chick in a bikini called Stuff.  And just the fact that I was able... 
[03:18:30]  Even though it's big letters, I was able to read that.  Anthony, we are in Diceman's court of law.  Did I not read that word correctly?  Yes, you did, Diceman.  And are you, in fact, the person that said that on that recording he just played?  Yes or no, Anthony?  It was taken out of context.  Yes or no, Anthony?  Did you say that was right?  Yes, taken out of context.  Yes or no?  Answer the question.  Yes, out of context.  He can actually...  Oh, well, you know what?  Since it's out of context, why don't you play us a little more? 
[03:19:00]  I sold out Madison Square Garden.  Hey, we got the Olive Garden checking in.  I think they got a spot for you.  Is this the Olive Garden?  Yeah, this is the Olive Garden.  How are you guys doing over there?  All right.  You want to talk to Dice?  Yeah, I'd like to speak to the Diceman.  Hey, Olive Garden, what's your problem?  Yeah, we want to know if you could sell out a table of four.  Table of four?  Are you insulting me?  Are you insulting me?  I think I...  You don't think I could sell out a table of four?  Let me tell you something.  Last week, I was at Burger King, 15 people. 
[03:19:30]  All right?  So don't tell me about a table of four.  What time?  All right, Olive Garden.  All right, peace.  Bye.  Hey, call me.  You think I'll call?  I'll be using the case.  Hold on a minute.  Did he call himself Dice again?  Kenny, that's another 35.  I'm keeping track.  Now, wait a minute.  This is all done in a spirit of fun and laughter.  Okay, and I'm going to laugh when I see you with the hot dog stand. 
[03:20:00]  I'm going to come over.  I'm going to go, hey, Anthony, look at you now.  See, you're a sauerkraut on that bun, all right?  And now I'm going to go, Anthony, do me a little.  Do me a little.  Say you're me again.  That's what I'm going to say to you.  Now, come on.  My wife's going to leave with me in a nice big stretch limo with the jacuzzi in it.  Champagne in the back.  We put on one of my house tapes.  We get all licking up and crazy.  And she'll be throwing my hot dog out the window.  Look at this, Anthony. 
[03:20:30]  See, he does have the apple, and it does look like a zebra.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personality.  I mean, you got a lot of personality.  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Your lowest common denominator.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is there anything sadder?  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:21:00]  Quick, change the channel.  No!  102.7 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay and...  All right, we want to take another call?  Yeah, we can do that.  Maybe you'd like to speak for me.  I'm just so used to it.  All right, Mike, what's up?  Give me a favor.  Ask Anthony when you're going to be playing my grandma's album.  All right, that might have been a club that came up in conversation.  Oh, wait, we got another thing here about my grandma's house.  Well, we got a few more. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, come on.  I thought we were through this.  We laughed your asses off up in Poughkeepsie.  How many people...  And ha-ha, I just laughed and my sack caved in.  You're all alone now, Anthony.  He would make up comedy clubs.  How does it feel?  Look.  He would make up comedy clubs that you'd be appearing at.  Come on.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Now, look.  How long are the cartoons going to play anywhere?  We see...  No, let me be straight.  We see the Diceman, 1988.  Bust, uh, open the scene.  Rodney Dangerfield special. 
[03:22:00]  Like, you break.  Huge.  You need to become the biggest comic ever in history.  That's what you're saying.  Right, huge.  So, how do you keep that level?  You can't.  I rest my care.  I know.  No.  I make a verdict from the jury.  But then...  Wait.  No, I'm done.  I'm done with the case.  Well...  We can take the next call now.  But then...  I didn't do enough for you.  No!  You just think you've been coming out with plenty of material because of me.  Exactly. 
[03:22:30]  See, you, you, you, uh, reach, uh, a huge place.  Yeah, but don't you think a performer should try other things in a career?  Of course.  I mean, I did about 900 arenas.  How many did I do to make you happy?  The bit, the bit is, your attitude is still like,  I'm Madison Square Garden.  I'm the biggest selling comedian of all time.  I got...  I know...  But that's the bit.  Because...  Oh, is that the bit?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Your Honor?  Well, Mr. Clay?  Mr. Clay, I got an example of Anthony trying to come up with new material. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Do you have any new material before you leave, Dice?  All new stuff.  I do new rhymes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Let's hear one of your new rhymes.  You're Bill Clinton and Monica.  Hey, you're busy.  It's funny stuff, huh?  Yeah.  Number one.  Let's talk.  You're wetting your pants over there.  Oh, I'm wetting my pants.  All right.  Number one.  It's a Linda Tripp poem.  All right.  You got that wrong.  All right.  So now you'll be smirching my material. 
[03:23:30]  Be smirching?  Tripp poem.  I don't know what that means.  I mean, be smirching?  You understand?  When I do the Linda Tripp poem, they'll be calling you and going,  why did you not do the Linda Tripp poem?  You were just making something up, weren't you?  Perhaps that will happen.  That's the way it's going to come down.  See, I didn't want to get into this.  Oh, he's all, him and Rick, hot enough stuff.  Obviously, I don't know how much you'd dump it, but get into it.  It's your life.  Dice, the people get a big... 
[03:24:00]  The hottest woman lives with you.  People get a big kick out of it.  You walk around the house and go,  honey, cook me some egg.  You know, now it's time to go...  You know, I'm going to take the dog off.  That's exactly it.  Now I'm going to be impersonal.  He means you're going to keep your personal.  I don't even know what that is.  Exactly, because that takes true talent to figure that out. 
[03:24:30]  Say it.  I can't.  I can't.  I don't even know what you said.  Then you will be asked that in the court of law.  In the court of law.  Say personality.  I mean, you're going to keep your personal.  Because until you can do that,  this lawsuit will be pending.  Dice, remember I was the one who helped you out.  Now, remember.  Now, wait a minute.  You're in it, too.  I'm going to get you out of this little, you know,  10 by 10 room.  Believe me.  You'll be traveling around with me,  Club Soda, Murray, Happy Face,  and Murray.  A couple laughs.  Murray?  I said Murray.  Oh, okay.  Bring the broads and bite it. 
[03:25:00]  You're going to have to unload this chick.  I'm sorry.  I mean, nice girl and everything,  but they're all over the place.  It's like toilet paper.  There you go.  I went to it.  I don't know why you had to start all this, man.  I have a little bit of fun.  See, but the only thing is that in his favor  is that he does a good impression.  Oh, thank you.  All the best I've heard.  He does many others, by the way.  Who else should do?  I can't remember now.  Who else is he doing?  See, I'm thrown.  Charlton Heston. 
[03:25:30]  Charlton Heston.  That's more of a goof on Charlton Heston  than really Chuck Heston.  So, wait, what are you saying?  What you're doing to me is not a goof?  I try to think of that  as a more accurate interpretation  of your voice.  So who do you think he does good?  I'll be good.  Al Sharpton.  Well, those are all like parodies.  He does like Charles Carole really good.  What are you parodies?  What's he doing on me?  Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan, he does real well.  But Ronald Reagan wouldn't even know it anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  That's why it's fun.  I don't know.  People have...  I don't know.  Popeye.  Just wait until they... 
[03:26:00]  Popeye.  Nobody cares.  It's a cartoon.  But then again,  like he has said on the radio,  I am a cartoon.  I'm not a human being.  I'm a cartoon.  I'm a cartoon.  Popeye.  Anthony.  Popeye.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  4-1-0 is only a number.  All right.  It's the worst of O&A.  Now, that usually would be it  with Dice versus Dice,  with the real Dice. 
[03:26:30]  But there was a portion of that  that I recovered a few months back.  Because after Dice left the studio,  Anthony started doing the impression of him again  during a commercial.  And Dice heard about it.  So Dice actually called up  during the middle of the commercial  because he was listening  and confronted Anthony about the impression.  So this is Dice calling back.  Check this out.  Like any of this crap.  It's the worst of O&A.  107-W-N-E-W. 
[03:27:00]  What's the matter?  No, I'm walking in the street.  People pulled up.  It's still on in the cars.  And Anthony don't know what to stop.  Hey, I've been good.  If he had a problem with me,  you should have said it right there and then.  I gave him the opportunity.  The fans called in.  They said,  if you've got a problem.  And I took it.  All right.  The guy who's goofing around.  And now you open your mouth again.  I didn't say nothing.  You said plenty. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, listen, Jerkoff.  You'll come back here.  Now I'm the Jerkoff.  Maybe you're the Jerkoff.  Okay?  You don't want to do this.  I try to come on the first.  See, I'm never the one to pull the first punch.  That's not me.  Like, even like all the Jerkoffs,  they're called in all the tough guys  that are in their apartment stone going,  my life means nothing,  so let me insult somebody else.  Is that what I'm going to start?  Is that what I've got to start thinking about you?  Or do I think,  hey, the guy does a good impression.  If he could get a few laughs off of it, 
[03:28:00]  let him get a few laughs.  You tell me what you want me to think.  It could go two ways.  We're friends.  Or there's a problem.  And if I got a problem,  you really got a problem.  Hey, I hear you, Dice.  You don't want to die.  Hey, hey, we left there.  Everything was nice.  Be nice.  Good for everybody.  I saw your wife downstairs.  I gave a quick squeeze and a kick.  You know what I mean?  I told the town.  I thought he did a good impression.  And now I'm walking down the street. 
[03:28:30]  The guy pulls over and goes,  Dice, you've got to hear this guy.  He's first going up.  People are instigating.  I haven't said one word.  I was listening in the frigging car over here.  I've got to go.  I've got to work the streets with this nonsense now.  And everybody's coming over.  Go, where is this?  Anthony, you pussy?  If he's got a problem, let him say it.  Dice, it's Opie.  I'll confess.  All right.  We've got to make up.  There's a hot chick walking by me now.  Honey, you want to be on the radio?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  You're too good for everybody. 
[03:29:00]  I'm your man on the street now.  Hey, honey, can I clear you?  I'm sorry.  I'm over here now.  Thank you.  You know what I mean?  I talked to everybody on the street.  I put all kinds of people on.  Hey, pal, say hello.  Hey, what's going on?  Say what's happening.  Did you hear that guy?  I'll go over to another guy that's actually very mad at you for what you did.  Here it is.  What's your name?  His name's Cliff.  Hold on.  All right.  Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are?  I'm tired of a pal.  I'm tired.  You're not sure.  You're not sure. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  Cliff, find yourself a pill or something.  Hey, Dice, get out of here.  Kenny, get this guy out of here.  Hey, Dice, can you talk to these people in the middle of the street for us?  This is the middle of the street.  I don't even know where we are, but we've got some high-looking numbers walking on.  Now, Dice, I'll go on record and say I consider you a pal now.  All right.  So we are friends, and when I come back to town, I'm coming back in there, and I want  to hear more of these clips.  Unless Howard makes up with you, and then he'll be on Howard's show. 
[03:30:00]  No, no, he's got to apologize.  He's got to be a man and apologize.  I said that to the guy calling in.  All right.  I don't owe him no apology.  Yeah, but...  But you know what?  You guys are fun.  Cool.  Well, a lot of people thought that we should have beat you up or something.  I don't get that, but...  Well, that you were going to come in here and beat me up.  Yeah.  Well, isn't that funny how everybody's brave when they're on the phone or when they're  on TV, but the minute they face you, all of a sudden they clam up.  You know, we had you in the studio, and then I'm like, hey, man, I like this guy, and 
[03:30:30]  he's making people laugh, and we had some fun.  That's all I care about.  Who's this now?  I'll be.  Yeah, Anthony...  You're the even-tempered one.  Well, Anthony...  I got no use for you.  I like people with emotions.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  Anthony, let him have it.  Let him have it, Anthony.  Anthony's got a lot of emotion in him.  He's got a lot of problems, a lot of penta-bangers.  That's why I relate to him.  Hey, Dice, but...  I don't relate to farmers.  Hey, Dice, because of you, Anthony, I changed his shirt after you left.  You missed the car.  The only thing I got to milk is between my... 
[03:31:00]  You know what, man?  The bus driver's just looking at me.  He's looking for Pete now.  But I just passed the hot-looking redhead, and you know what they do for me.  What?  Oh, me and Jack, I've got to keep the guy's pussy-hovel.  All right, guys.  I'm going to let you go.  All right, please.  Don't make me clap back.  All right, Dice.  Come see us again, all right?  That's right.  I'll be looking for you.  All right.  Don't worry.  I know just where to find you.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  Take it easy.  How you doing? 
[03:31:30]  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're listening to Opie and the guy that wants to be me show on WNEW 102.7.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So pay attention, answer.  107.  WNEW.  Let's talk about the millionaire.  The millionaire. 
[03:32:00]  Who wants to marry a whore?  Yeah, I am very disappointed in Fox.  Yeah.  That's where I go for, you know, the sensational TV.  We've all seen the shows.  And now they do Who Wants to Marry a Whore?  World's scariest police chase is five.  Yeah.  Things like that.  All those fun programs.  And then they come up with Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  Yeah.  And it turns out the guy had a restraining order against him.  Might not even be a millionaire at this point.  He lives in like this little house. 
[03:32:30]  Lives in a crappy house.  In San Diego somewhere.  Trust me, I'm nowhere near a millionaire.  And I live in a better house than he does.  Than this millionaire guy.  I think most of us do.  They showed the house on Dateline last night.  I'm like, that's not where a millionaire lives.  Yeah, so it turns out somebody dug up some documents on him.  God, you've got to love the internet, man.  Like years ago, this stuff didn't happen.  But it was on the smokinggun.com.  That's a great website.  You go there and find all kinds of dirt on people.  They've got documents and court papers and all kinds of stuff there. 
[03:33:00]  And they turned up a restraining order that this guy's ex-fiancee filed against him.  For pushing her around, smacking her, and saying he was going to kill her.  Well, the quote from the restraining order, I've got it right in front of me here.  Rockwell threw me around and slapped and hit me in the face.  Recently, he said he would find me and kill me.  Come on!  Many times during sex, he attempted to become physically and verbally abusive.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  His temper is short, and he will randomly throw anything in his tap.  I don't like it, you bitch, don't you?  See, I see nothing wrong with that.  Ah, Mike Tyson.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with that way he treats his whores.  You've got to knock him around a little bit.  Yeah.  What do all abused women have in common?  Ah, what, Mike?  They don't effing listen.  Listen to Iron Mike.  Just ask that bitch, Robin Givens. 
[03:34:00]  I gave her a couple.  Hey, could you turn down Iron Mike's punches?  What?  Because they hurt my ears.  A little hungover, Mike?  Yeah.  Mike went to the detail party.  There was some bitchy whores down there last night.  Little squarmy model types.  The waifs.  Yeah.  What a bunch of glass jaws on those whores.  I gave one a punch to the uterus, right in her camel toe.  It split her right in half.  Oh, come on. 
[03:34:30]  She busted wide open.  I hate whores that can't take a punch.  Are you going to be the next person to do who wants to marry an abusive millionaire?  I am indeed a millionaire.  Yeah.  I made a lot of money boxing.  Yeah.  And I want to do the show.  I want to go on there and marry a whore.  Now, how would you pick your future bride live on TV there?  How many do you get to choose from?  A hell of a lot.  Like 50 or so.  50 disgusting whores. 
[03:35:00]  I like that.  So I go down the line.  And the first thing I'll do is like nail them with a few body blows.  See if they can take some punches to the gut.  You dirty bitch.  Shut up.  And how would you determine after you hit them a few times?  Which one would be?  Well, they'd all fall down.  So the ones that fall down a little slower.  Yeah.  Those are the ones I would choose for a finalist.  Okay.  And then they go to the Iron Mike Tyson motel room for a little alleged rape. 
[03:35:30]  That's where I pin them down and I bang them against their will.  But it's just allegedly.  Yeah.  Remember that.  Of course.  Keep Opie and Anthony out of trouble.  Allegedly.  How do you spell it?  Allegedly.  E.  M. 
[03:36:00]  A.  A.  A.  A-I-O-U.  Who cares how you spell it?  All right.  I know what it means.  It's up in there and they don't get sued by a big goddamn boxing maniac.  Then I went, okay, then I have that.  Yeah.  And the way I choose finalists from that.  Yeah, now you got, let's say you got the ten finalists on stage.  Who can accept Iron Mike for anal? 
[03:36:30]  That would narrow it down pretty quickly.  I swear, wait, you ain't seen nothing until you've seen Iron Mike's Louisiana black snake.  It's got a mind of its own.  It rapes women.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Thank God I keep saying that.  Shut up, you whore.  Oh, she's out.  She's out of the competition.  You see how easy it is? 
[03:37:00]  Come here, I grab this one by the throat.  She's right down.  How am I supposed to have fun with her whore like that?  She can't take a punch.  Look at her bleed.  And then for the final one, when I get down to the final three, I bite each one of their ears off.  I spit in their face.  Up in the jam.  Body goes to the uterus.  And then the one that still has the most blood in their body is the one I take home to be my bride. 
[03:37:30]  My bride, Mrs. Iron Mike, filthy whore.  On the next episode of Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire, right?  Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire.  And then you know what we do for Honeymoon?  I grab her and I climb the Empire State Building and swat at biplanes.  Until they shoot me down. 
[03:38:00]  Plus, beauty killed the beast.  Allegedly.  Either that or I hit on her with a space shovel and bury her in the backyard with other dirty girls.  You're a dirty girl.  Allegedly.  Very nice.  Fuck me on the show.  All right.  Whore.  Iron Mike, I'm the next Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire. 
[03:38:30]  Just like Rick Rockwell.  Oh, my God.  God damn.  Damn.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone has comments about this stupid show.  Ronnie, what's up?  I got to tell you, man.  Fox crossed the frigging line with this show.  I actually threw a pot at my wife.  I threw a pot.  I went under the sink, threw a frigging pot at her.  I said, I cannot believe this thing is on television.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it. 
[03:39:00]  Well, they always cross the line.  That's why I'm pissed off at Fox.  They should be rerunning that show now.  Instead, they're like, no, we can't rerun it because it's so controversial.  They've made a living off being controversial.  Rerun the stupid show.  Let's take another look at Rick Rockwell.  I was the one who said right after that show that he was a psychopath.  I want to know who looked this guy's history up.  Helen Keller?  You can't figure this out?  That this guy's a lunatic?  Screw his history.  I don't understand why we're not digging up his backyard as we speak. 
[03:39:30]  He's probably got some bodies back there.  He's got some bones back there.  You never know.  Allegedly.  You've got to live in the projects out here, for Christ's sake.  What kind of millionaire is fixing his own plumbing?  Yeah.  How many millionaires live in the projects?  That's a good point.  I mean, what's up with that?  He's not a rap artist.  Forget it.  I mean, Fox has such mud on their fat.  I'm glad they do because they put most dangerous headaches on and most biggest periods women  have and most fantastic bike rides, whatever the hell people watch. 
[03:40:00]  Now they're putting this crap on to boost.  This is out of control.  That millionaire was a pussy, too.  I swear to God, I saw the interview with him and they didn't even have sex on their honeymoon.  They went, where would, where'd they go on a cruise?  They went on a cruise, had separate rooms.  That's what I said, a cruise.  We got a cruise, right.  See, he would be able to keep that girl if he worked the honeymoon like I and Mike Tyson  works it.  Yeah, how do you work it?  Well, some delicate mood lighting in the suite.  Oh, yeah.  In that little cabin on the cruise ship. 
[03:40:30]  Bottle of champagne, maybe?  A bottle of champagne.  Oh, yes.  Nice, easy music.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe like Marvin Gaye.  Uh-huh.  Nice, easy music.  And then maybe she wears some lingerie.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe some body oils and stuff?  Yeah, body oils.  Yeah.  They're all loosened up, nice, a couple of drinks.  Oh, yeah.  And then I sweet pork her.  Uh-huh.  Little sweet pork.  Okay.  And then I bury my fish so far up her.  I work her like a hand puppet. 
[03:41:00]  I put on a little puppet show after I punch her in the uterus.  I whisper sweet nothings in her ear as I bite it off.  Shut up!  Oh!  All completely alleged.  Allegedly?  Yeah, allegedly.  Okay.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up, ONA?  How are you?  I got the name for the next Fox special. 
[03:41:30]  What?  When Millionaires Attack.  That would be pretty good.  That's very good.  When Millionaires Attack on Fox.  Very good.  Brought to you with the cooperation of the men and women that are psychopaths.  I'm telling you, that guy is a psycho.  Yeah.  Dig up his yard now.  What are we waiting for?  I don't know who sat down and talked to the guy.  Like, they must have interviewed him.  I mean, they had to sit down with the producers, right?  I mean, three words out of this guy's mouth, you'd be going, oh, oh, no. 
[03:42:00]  We booked the lunatic.  Right.  Oh, no.  This guy is completely insane.  Yeah.  He's certifiable.  Well, we got some clips of Rockwell.  On this clip, it's worth playing.  Rockwell compares marriage to computers, to buying a computer.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to sound like a harsh analogy, but have you ever heard someone talk about buying  a computer?  You say you buy a computer, you check them out, you find all the features you want, and 
[03:42:30]  then you make the best decision you can based on the amount of money you have to spend and  the information you have at the time, and then after you do it, you don't look back.  Right.  Because the next day, there's going to be another computer that's more powerful and better.  And I kind of tried to approach my decision on that basis.  Yeah, yeah.  Like the Dell computer with the...  What? 
[03:43:00]  What?  He's comparing his...  You're putting your floppy disk into the hard drive.  Yeah.  Just like a computer.  When I get mad at it, I hit it with the baseball bat and shatter its monitor.  John, what's going on?  That guy, he sounds like a homo if I ever heard one.  Yeah, you're thinking gay, huh?  Yeah, just going by his voice.  I would have to agree with John.  Sure.  Did you see the news last night?  He just told all the news people.  Say that again.  I'm sorry.  He was giving away pizza.  There's a little news media hanging out in front of his house. 
[03:43:30]  He was?  Yeah.  What a guy.  With like five boxes of pizza.  Oh, yeah.  That's what a millionaire does.  Knows how to win over the crowd.  Goes to Domino's.  That's good.  Pizza.  He's not a millionaire.  He's a psycho killer.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Lifestyles of the rich and abusive.  Let's go into the house of Rockwell that costs in the hundreds of dollars.  Here's Rockwell in his sprawling shack. 
[03:44:00]  Working off the old sperm bank he just met on television.  Let's look at his house.  What's that in the crawl space?  Dead bodies.  As Rockwell drives in the luxury of his Dodge Dart.  It's a 1972 Dodge Dart.  Wonderful. 
[03:44:30]  Let's look at the master bedroom.  What's that smell?  There's a body under the bed.  He's dressed to the nines.  In his Wrangler jeans.  And Puma sneakers.  Let's go to the luxurious backyard.  Where he could fit up to two Weber grills. 
[03:45:00]  Lifestyles of the rich and abusive.  What a tool.  All right.  Let's open his closet and see his collection of concert t-shirts.  That guy's not a millionaire.  Why did the rush one always shrink?  They did have the cheapest concert t-shirts.  Damn, it was a midriff top.  That's a great obscure reference right there.  Gabe from Queens on the Instant Feedback app.  They ought to make those pseudo-reality shows really interesting. 
[03:45:30]  Something like, Who Wants to Marry for a Green Card?  With 50 illegals trying out for an American bachelor.  After you get a winner, you let loose the INS agents after the other 49.  Watch them scatter like roaches in the light.  Now there's a show for Fox.  Come on.  That's great.  That is a good one.  That's Gabe from Queens.  Very good.  Get our best stuff from you effers.  Look at all the wife-beater t-shirts.  How appropriate.  TK from Long Island on the Instant Feedback. 
[03:46:00]  On BET or the WB, they should have, Who Wants to Marry a Welfare Recipient?  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  It's the inappropriate gong.  Who wants to marry a welfare recipient?  You'll win a life supply of government cheese and food stamps amounting in the tens of dollars. 
[03:46:30]  You'll be whisked away in a 62 Cadillac.  You'll be getting a shopping cart full of depositable bottles.  And a snorkel jacket.  Let's look at our contestants.  Oh, look at Ziggy.  Oh, look at Ziggy.  Oh, boy.  We'll take a quick break here. 
[03:47:00]  Who wants to marry a millionaire?  Kid toucher.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Sucks, man.  From wall to wall.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
