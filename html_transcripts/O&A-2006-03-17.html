<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony St. Patrick's Day broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe was a chaotic spectacle of unrestrained energy and highly offensive language. The show opened with the hosts acknowledging the wildly unruly crowd, described as "maniacs" and likened to a "Nambla meeting."  Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, and Bill Burr were among the numerous studio guests present throughout the broadcast.

Early highlights included Twitchels, a stand-up comedian with Tourette's Syndrome, whose performance, punctuated by involuntary tics and outbursts,  was met with audience chants of "Jump!"  Big A and Twitchels attempted a disastrous reading of a St. Patrick's Day story, hampered by Big A's pronunciation struggles and microphone malfunctions.  A midget performed an impromptu striptease for money thrown on stage.  A man in half a Hulk Hogan mask engaged in drunken banter, and "Stalker Patty" delivered a raucous karaoke rendition of "White Rabbit."  Schizo Bill, a comedian identifying as schizophrenic, performed a set and got into a heated argument with Rich Voss over accusations of exploitation regarding performance fees and merchandise sales.

Hulk Hogan made a surprise appearance, interacting with the audience and joking about his family.  His wife was encouraged, though she didn't comply, to flash the crowd.  This segment, also featuring his daughter Brooke and son Nick, built upon prior discussion of Brooke's popularity and his wife's Playboy past.  Twitchels interacted with Hogan, requesting a Hulk Hogan chop.  Hogan discussed his family's reality show, *Hogan Knows Best*, and his relationship with Sylvester Stallone, culminating in both he and Brooke removing their shirts for the audience.

Other guests included Damien Fahey from MTV's TRL, who commented on the chaos; Master Poe, a karate-performing singer who delivered a bizarre musical performance;  internet personalities Neo is God and Scoliope, who both removed their shirts before Scoliope's abrupt departure; and Anthony's brother Elmo, whose off-key karaoke led to outbursts directed at someone named Bob.  Musical performances included Anthony's rendition of "Sweet Caroline," his mother's performance of "Bobby McGee," and Danny's performance of Black Sabbath's "War Pigs."  A heavily intoxicated audience member repeatedly fell asleep on his feet.  A planned hard-boiled egg eating contest was cancelled due to health code violations.

A significant portion of the show involved a discussion about a possibly fentanyl-laced "pot lollipop,"  followed by a segment featuring women from the Paltalk online community.  At the hosts' repeated requests, many of these women exposed their breasts and other body parts on camera.  Dr. Ian Smith was briefly asked his opinion on their figures.  "Don Knox," a man resembling an older Hulk Hogan, expressed his displeasure at the lack of further female nudity.  The show concluded with thank-yous to sponsors, staff, and guests.  The entire broadcast was consistently marked by vulgar language, sexually explicit content, and provocative behavior from hosts, guests, and audience members.

[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Come on, come on, right here.  Come on, come on. 
[00:05:00]  There they are.  There are the animals.  Look at this.  Look at this room full of maniacs. 
[00:05:30]  Fucking cow talk scum.  Wow.  Look at him.  Opie's working the crowd.  Yeah, there you go.  He's high-fiving.  That's right.  Pull them in there.  Balloons.  There you go.  That's your people.  Yeah.  There's your people.  There's your people.  That's right, Opie.  Reach out to your people.  Wow.  Wow.  We bow to you guys.  Thank you.  Here they are.  That's right.  The masses.  Yeah.  Welcome to the worst show you're going to hear this year. 
[00:06:00]  Fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's like a Nambla meeting.  It's like a Nambla meeting.  It is a Nambla meeting.  Well, I got to ask, how many of you were here for last year's festivities?  All right.  Got a couple of repeat offenders that are here. 
[00:06:30]  Remember?  Fuck you trying to reach out to me?  Oh, I know.  Hey, how many of you are regular?  I just wanted to know how many people would know what to expect, which is not much, and  a lot of anger and racism.  Well, at least this year, the bars opened a lot earlier, so that'll help the broadcast.  I said it, I don't know if it was drowned out by the crowd, but welcome to the worst radio 
[00:07:00]  show of the year.  I'm going to just say that right off the bat.  That hurt.  You guys want to introduce some people on the stage.  They've helped out the radio show tremendously while Jim Norton's being a star in Hollywood.  Let's hear it for Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice O'Neill, also known as T-Bone on Arrested Development. 
[00:07:30]  And you might know him as one of the stock guys in the office.  All right.  No, I guess they don't.  I said might.  I didn't say definitely.  Next to Patrice O'Neill.  You know him, you love him, and sometimes you hate him.  It's Rich Voss, everyone.  Oh, listen to the ovation.  You know what?  These fucking guys will go wild over this leprechaun, right? 
[00:08:00]  Go fuck yourselves.  It's like being at a Nambla meeting.  Why don't you try chanting something he's not used to hearing. 
[00:08:30]  Barney is funnier.  Barney is funnier.  Look at that little fucking fidget.  Here's the deal, you motherfuckers.  Any of you that come see me live will never say that again.  Okay, now kiss my ass.  All right.  Rick Voss, everyone.  Rick is talking shit.  Yeah, I'm talking smack.  I'm talking smack.  And finally, on the end, let's hear it for Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr.  See that, Rick?  You ever feel that in an improv? 
[00:09:00]  That's what happened.  They love him.  They love him.  He signed up for a second tour of duty for a St. Paddy show.  Bill was here last year very early in his career on our show.  I think it was only your second appearance on the show.  Oh, yeah.  He left.  And again, I had to get the horrified Bill Burr speech about how he's not sure if he wants  this show to be part of his resume of his career.  That is absolute horseshit.  Shut up, you fucking sheep.  I didn't even know Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, Burr, I could turn him on you in a fucking second.  Stop acting like you're wearing your sword.  I'm not afraid of you.  That's because he was doing Star and Buck back then.  Oh, no.  You think these guys know who that is?  The first best.  Just because we're not in the studio doesn't mean we didn't bring the car crash.  That's right.  We need the car crash wherever we go.  All right.  You guys ready to meet Twitchels for the first time?  Oh, thank God. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're starting off big.  We're starting off real big.  We had to sit in the dressing room with him for a while, and he just babbled about his  Tourette's.  Yeah, he's...  Enough already.  He's really nervous.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitchels!  Center stage.  Center stage, Twitchels.  Where's he going?  His direction...  Right up front, we can be humiliated.  His sense of direction has been correct.  That was an accident. 
[00:10:30]  Yo, what's up, guys?  Woo!  Hey, screw that.  Now we can start to jump, Chance.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Look at this twitching river dance motherfucker.  His pants have Tourette's.  They're twitching off of him. 
[00:11:00]  What the hell is...  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He looks like an ugly Catholic pepper.  This is awesome, guys.  It's like Tate's.  Well, uh...  Tina is the...  I don't think there's anybody that doesn't know, but Twitchels has Tourette's Syndrome,  and he's a stand-up comic.  Would you guys like to hear some of his stand-up comedy?  Let's give him, like, a minute.  Yeah.  Let's give him a minute.  Give him a little bit.  Give him a little bit of stuff. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Let's hear Twitchels.  I can't hear you!  Oh!  Oh, my God.  He sounds like Bobcat.  Wow!  This feels great!  Do I...  No, it doesn't.  You're not...  He's fighting it.  He's fighting it.  His pants are falling down.  He really is in awful shape. 
[00:12:00]  I never noticed that.  You people are as fucked up as my therapist!  Yeah!  Yeah, you would think someone Twitching all the time would be...  Oh, this?  This?  Is that better?  I found somebody that spits more than me.  You know what?  What?  I...  Guys!  I met Rich Ross for the first time backstage, and for once, I finally feel fucking normal!  Yeah!  It's a feel-good presentation. 
[00:12:30]  Give him a joke, Richels.  I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  Guys, thank you so much.  You want me to go?  Yeah, give him a minute of comedy.  Let's go.  Give him some of your act.  Guys, thank you so much for coming out.  I appreciate it.  Yeah!  Let him try one.  Let him do one.  Yeah!  He can't get it through his act, because they keep making it.  He's doing his act, so...  Twitchels, do your act for, like, one minute. 
[00:13:00]  All right, people!  Ask him what it's called.  I am so happy to be here.  This is great.  You know what?  A lot of things, people are asking me, what's it like to have Tourette's?  What's your name?  You.  I want you to take your right hand, start banging it on your head.  Start banging it on your head.  All right, now try to take your left hand, and start banging it on your other hand at the  same time.  All right, now try to bite her nipple at the same time.  Yeah!  That's...  That's...  What do you see or heard? 
[00:13:30]  They love it!  They absolutely love it, Twitchels!  They love it!  Come on, he's working out some new shit!  Right, right!  He's doing premium plans next month!  That's it?  No.  Absolutely not!  Well, what's his real name?  He's not an act, he's an act with that.  It's Lewis, so they're just chanting,  Lou!  That's what they're saying.  It wasn't boo, they were saying Lou!  All right, Twitchels, one more joke before we move on here.  One more joke.  And make it a joke.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's your name?  What's your name, right there?  Wait a second!  No, no, I'm serious!  Have you ever fucked anyone with Tourette's? 
[00:14:00]  Because you look familiar!  Oh!  That was close!  You look familiar!  I can't, I can't, I can't!  It's Andrew Tourette's play!  Yeah!  Yeah!  What is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is he doing?  All right!  All right, listen.  If anybody can, then you make me a fucker man! 
[00:14:30]  Yeah!  All right, we're already losing control, that's all right.  You guys, let's hear it for Twitchels, we're going to move on here.  There he is.  Your favorite Tourette's comic.  What a mess.  He is a mess.  They're chanting jump as he leaves the stage.  All right, you guys.  They're from a building.  You guys, one of our greatest creations is hitting the stage right now. 
[00:15:00]  Let's hear it for Big A!  Oh, he's got a haircut, look at him.  Oh, wow.  He's got an Adolf Hitler haircut.  That is like, that is like Shep Howard hair.  Adolf, Adolf.  Adolf, Adolf.  Someone get a Sharpie.  Yeah, we need a Sharpie.  Get a Sharpie, motherfucker.  Hey, Big A, give me a black Sharpie.  Big A.  You got a Sharpie?  I got something that'll go great with that haircut.  I need a black Sharpie.  Yeah, you got to put up with this shit. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, come on.  That haircut, where'd you get that?  Come on, lean in.  All right.  Anthony is making a Hitler mustache on Big A.  Oh, it looks terrific, too.  Well, he's got the Adolf haircut, so we got to give him the mustache now.  That's not coming off any time soon. 
[00:16:00]  There it is.  All right, turn around and meet your.  That's not right.  With one hand.  That's it.  That's not right.  Man, the Fures had a little too much Brocklars.  All right, everyone.  Let's get a few words from Big A.  Big A, address the crowd, will you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Mike doesn't work.  He puts him in the oven, and then he eats him. 
[00:16:30]  Goebbels' head's going to roll for this one.  Is it on?  No.  All right, now the mic is on.  Now the mic is on.  Here we go.  What up, man?  They're trying to get his wireless mic to work.  We got the roadies on the stage fixing Big A's microphone.  All right, you guys.  Let's hear it.  Let's Big A talk for a minute.  Here we go.  Big A, everyone. 
[00:17:00]  I want to wish everybody a happy St. Paddy's Day.  Big A, it's like this.  Hey, where'd you get the haircut, really?  Hey, where'd you get the haircut, really?  Actually, a friend cut it for me.  A friend cut it for you.  No, an enemy cut it for you.  Yeah, that's a joke.  What did he use, like a bowl and a razor right around the back? 
[00:17:30]  Because I got to say, the back looks like those old Our Gang kind of haircuts from the 30s.  What?  It's a fat little rattle.  Spaceship.  It really takes away from the rest of his life.  Yeah, it really brings everybody's eyesight up to the hair, and you don't concentrate on the rest of the...  That fucking walking mess.  Fucking do some stuff. 
[00:18:00]  That's fantastic.  The haircut and the mustache of Adolf Hitler and the body of Hermann Göring.  Come on, it's funny if you watch the Hitler Channel.  I do every day.  All right.  What we're going to do now is we're going to bring Twitchels back on the stage.  And we're going to have...  If you guys are faithful listeners of the show, and obviously you are,  you guys know Big A and Twitchels read the news for us on our program. 
[00:18:30]  Well, today for St. Paddy's Day, they're going to do a little story of St. Patrick.  The story of St. Patrick sticking with the mood.  This is going to be fantastic.  The story of St. Patrick.  With Twitchels and Big A.  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Oh!  Yeah, fuck you!  Nah!  That was too loud.  You're blowing out my eardrums, Twitchels. 
[00:19:00]  All right, you guys, here we go.  It's Big A and Twitchels, the story of St. Patrick.  Go ahead, Big A, get us going.  Ah!  Hold on, hold on, hold on, just in case people are wondering, Big A has started reading.  He just can't get past the first word yet. 
[00:19:30]  No.  Sound it out.  Big A has problems with words that start with S-T.  He can't say them.  And the first word is stagger.  Let's see if he can get to it.  All right, once again, it's Big A, Twitchels, the story of St. Patrick.  Big A, start us off.  Oh, my God.  No, don't close the thing.  Get you, baby. 
[00:20:00]  Wait, wait.  All right, Anthony, Anthony, we're losing control here because he really can't get it going here.  Come on, Big A, what's the matter?  All right, you got to talk loud into the mic so they can hear you back home, you know.  Yeah, talk right into the mic and get those S-T words out.  Come on. 
[00:20:30]  All right, here we go.  Once again, it's Big A and Twitchels, the story of St. Patrick.  Step up to the edge of the stage.  Yeah, get closer to the people.  Come on.  All right.  Come on.  Big A.  Come on.  Here you go, Big A.  All right, Big A.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on, buddy.  Come on, buddy.  You can do it.  You can do it.  You can do it.  You can do it. 
[00:21:00]  You can do it.  Let's go, buddy.  He's not on.  He's not on.  He's not on.  He's not on.  He's off again.  Do you want me to start from my part?  Is your mic on?  It's not on?  Are you sure?  Oh, got it. 
[00:21:30]  Got it.  Got it.  Got it.  Got it.  Got it.  Who's going to get drunk with me?  Yeah, that's what I like.  I love it.  Do you want me to get drunk with you?  Wait.  Who will have sex with me? 
[00:22:00]  Could someone grab that fucking mic away from him?  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Jesus.  Twitzels, give me the fucking mic.  Until that glitch gets worked out.  Anthony, explain what's going on here, man.  And by glitch, I mean him still breathing.  All right.  Holy shit.  He just blew out all our eardrums up here on the stage.  Oh, holy crap.  Yeah, I don't know.  It sounded like they went to turn up Big A and turned up Twitzels instead, which is a horrid idea.  That was very, very bad. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  My head's spinning.  There was awful, awful feedback there.  I'm glad they test all this shit out beforehand.  We never go out on the road without a full testing of everything, right?  And we test right when we hit the air.  That's when the test starts.  All right.  My God.  I heard a great chant before when the curtain was closed of show your tits.  What happened?  Who was that?  Yeah.  And she showed.  But then I heard a suck that cock chant. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, there we go.  There you go.  All right.  That'll be tits, calms them down.  I know how to work it.  Oh, hey, how you doing?  Hey, how does that guy have tits?  Your hair's a little short, so you look like Harry Potter with nice cans.  I got to be honest with you.  You kind of got the ground glasses, the short hair.  You got a boyish little look, but you got great tits, as does little Harry Potter. 
[00:23:30]  That's great.  Can you, uh, can someone lift her up so maybe she can show the crowd?  Because those are pretty good.  Yeah, we already got a beach ball going.  Yeah, lift, just lift her up a little bit.  Hey, guys, look, we got a good caliber of girl here today.  There you go.  That's nice.  Look, not bad, right?  Get out of the way, Twitter.  You know, she was the, um...  Rob fucking Bo, man.  When you see the nurse on Halloween, she did this on Halloween, too, I think.  You remember that shit, Patrice. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're good like that.  All right, very good.  Very good.  Back into your people.  Try not to get picked up like a bowling ball by those animals.  Let's go back out.  All right, are we stupid enough to try this again?  Yes, we are.  We certainly are.  All right.  You know why?  It's the spirit of St. Patrick's Day that we're trying to get across with these two idiots.  All right.  And I'm not going to let equipment problems get in the way.  Plus, you're educating people.  Thank you, Bill.  The story of St. Patrick's Day.  Of course.  It fits the whole reason we're here today.  And it takes... 
[00:24:30]  To drink and be racist.  It takes Big A so long to get going that it fucks up everybody.  Oh, I know.  All right, we're going to try this again.  It's not like they have a long attention span, these people.  They're making Twichels jump again on stage.  He's fighting it.  He's fighting it.  We're just kind of stalling.  We're trying to get the wireless mics going again.  Oh!  There he goes.  So he was fighting the urge, but he had to jump again.  Anthony, there's also PowTalk cameras all over the Hard Rock today?  Well, apparently so.  I can't get them up on my camera, so I don't know what they're going. 
[00:25:00]  But hopefully they're out there and people are tuned in, watching the festivities as they happen.  But watching might be better than hearing at this point.  Than actually or being here.  Exactly.  All right.  Is Big A ready again?  We're going to try this again?  Give it a try.  All right.  Get out there, Big A, if you're ready.  All right.  Here we go.  We're going to try this one more time.  It's Big A and Twichels.  The story of St. Patrick.  Big A, whenever you're ready, start. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  The first word he's going to attempt to say is stagger, by the way.  Here we go.  Nice and loud, Big A.  You can do it!  Move on!  Take out of the morning!  Stagger, close your friends, and let me start the stimulating story of St. Patrick, a tale steeped in history.  All right.  Patrick was born in the second half of the fourth century A.D. in Brighton. 
[00:26:00]  He was born...  Oh, brother.  All right.  He was born whatever that means.  I don't know.  He was born now, Scott, and did not change his name to Patrick until he became a priest much later in life.  As a teenager, he was...  I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I don't know if he's going to be like that.  He was...  ...tucked into shackles and kidnapped by a whole group of pirates and sold into slavery in Ireland.  After six years of committing...  What?  Starring... 
[00:27:00]  ...to Patrick's...  ...to Patrick's...  ...to Patrick's stall.  Patrick's stall.  Help us out.  Oh, my God.  Roll away from his captors.  Jump shit, if you will.  And...  If you will.  Started.  Started.  Started. 
[00:27:30]  What?  Lost.  Started.  Just...  ...study...  ...in a modest...  ...  ...  Did you pick up the pants?  All right.  Back to Twitch also.  Patrick studied there for many years, eventually being bequeathed the honor of Bishop in the year 42 by Pope...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[00:28:00]  ...  ...  ... 
[00:28:30]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[00:29:00]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  Patrick was credited with...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[00:29:30]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  churches in  Ireland  I feel like I'm in a Led Zeppelin concert.  And found it  that  he also 
[00:30:00]  escaped more than 12  attempts on his life.  Sounds fucking familiar.  Is that Wee Man?  All right, we finally end with Big A.  Go ahead, Big A, finally.  Legend  also  States, States.  Legend also  States, States.  That he  stamped 
[00:30:30]  out of the existence of  snakes in Ireland.  Although some  they'll believe  that this is simply  a metaphor  for converting  all of the pagans  of Ireland to Christianity.  Patrick's life  stopped  in his heart.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  Yes.  Do you like this?  It's good.  A March 17th 
[00:31:00]  in the year  461 of the  standard  to come on  and get through  this bucket thing.  Standard  Christian calendar.  His death is  still  driving in a car  listening.  Still  celebrated  every  year  to this  every day.  There you go.  Now that you've  heard the tale  start. 
[00:31:30]  Start.  You got it?  Sound it out?  Christianity.  Christianity.  Start.  Start.  Nothing  drinks into your  stomach.  All right.  Let's hear it for  Big A and Twitchels.  Yeah.  The story of  St. Patrick.  Good job.  I had no idea  what that was about.  When Twitchels  was helping  it was like  It was horrible.  It was like  pork roll  helping Scrapple.  All right.  Who's the fidget?  Who's the midget 
[00:32:00]  over there?  Opie.  They don't like  being called that.  I like being  called midgets.  And  there he is.  Look at you.  And he's married.  Isn't that  what this is all  about?  He's married.  Here get him  over Mike.  This guy works  once a year.  He has a wife.  You are.  Where's your wife?  All right.  This is.  He's a little  person.  Opie.  A little person.  How tall are you  bro?  Wait.  My height  on my dick.  Oh. 
[00:32:30]  Hang on.  I got a log  in my underwear.  Has there ever  been a funny midget?  I mean who could  just stand on  his material.  Where's all the  fucking Irish people?  Those are great  midget  Rips brother shoes  he has on.  All right.  Those are Norton  shoes.  You like my shoes  huh?  Let me see your  hands.  I want to see  if mine are bigger.  Hey.  Nice teeth.  Oh my God.  They're almost  the same size.  They are very  comparable to  midget hands boss.  Nice teeth. 
[00:33:00]  What are we going  to do with the  midget today?  You fucking  horse tooth jackass.  Oh.  Wow.  Follow the  yellow brick road.  I thought there  was only one  horse tooth jackass.  We got another  horse tooth jackass.  Someone throw him  into the crowd  please.  Kick him off the  stage boss.  So now  little guy  what do you do?  You remember me?  No.  You bust a point  Dexter.  I just  you dress up 
[00:33:30]  like this  every  every day  except holidays.  Oh  today's a holiday.  You lost weight  and got kicked  out of here.  Andrew Dice  Midget.  I'm over here  now.  Oh.  There he goes.  Hey do  Seinfeld.  What?  This motherfucker  has the confidence  of a dwarf.  Whip him out.  Whip him out. 
[00:34:00]  Nice tits.  What is the  midget doing here?  Like what do you do?  It's a leprechaun  at St. Paddy's  Day.  Oh.  Oh my God.  It's age  shrinking.  I want to see  my shillelagh.  So one day  a year  he gets to feel  good about himself.  And you get a lot  of attention  one day a year?  Yeah.  One day a year  I get...  Well  on Christmas  he plays an elf.  I got a fucking  shillelagh  right here.  Two days a year.  Two days a year.  He pulled out  the shillelagh joke  twice.  Two times. 
[00:34:30]  So do you dress  as an elf  on Christmas too?  An elf on Christmas  a leprechaun  at St. Paddy's  and a fucking  male stripper  once in a while.  Oh.  Oh.  Can he do  some stage diving?  I want to see  the midget stage dive.  You think you guys  could handle  the midget stage diving?  Put on some  fucking stripping music.  I'll fuck  his ship right now.  Yeah!  Hey, he's having  a better set 
[00:35:00]  than Twitchell.  He certainly is.  And he's got  more dignity.  Wait, he really  wants...  The midget  really wants  to strip.  Do we have  any house music  we can throw on?  Yeah!  We got any house music  for the stripper?  Here we go.  His hands barely  met behind his head.  I know.  His hat's  going to go.  There you go.  It's leprechaun  striptease.  This one's  for the ladies  out there.  All kind of...  Oh, yeah.  All ten of...  All ten of the ladies. 
[00:35:30]  Is he going to  strip or what?  That's right.  All right, well,  this is...  There you go.  Yeah, give him a  sit in your lap dance.  All right, we got  the leprechaun  slowly but surely  taking his clothes off.  He's...  Oh, jeez.  He's doing the  vest-between-the-legs gag.  Yeah.  Going over to the ladies.  Really...  The ladies are  giving him dollar bills,  Opie.  The money's coming out.  You think he's  going to lay in  the fetal position  in the sink later  and cry about this?  Hey.  You think...  You think Otto knows  he's working without him? 
[00:36:00]  There goes the vest.  All right.  All right.  He's...  That's right.  It's hilarious.  What goes off next?  The leprechaun hat.  Slip on out of  those Brooks Brothers shoes.  That's good.  He's got on booty shorts.  Running those  Vienna sausages  through his hair.  And always put  the money in his hat.  If you guys want to see more,  throw the dollars  on the stage.  Yeah.  Here comes that big belt,  that leprechaun  big belt buckle belt.  That's right.  And that little  midget mail pad 
[00:36:30]  baldness  that he could never hide  because we could all  see the top of his head.  There he goes.  He's...  Wow.  He's taking...  Just rubbed the belt  across his non-existent paint.  Shouldn't this guy be...  Shouldn't this guy be  teaching Patrick Swayze  how to run through trains  and move cans...  Move soda cans...  Oh, they got coins.  Taking his fake beard off.  The beard's off.  Now, there's dollars  and coins coming up.  Oh, no.  Here come the coins.  Make a wish.  Make a wish.  Now, they're just 
[00:37:00]  throwing coins.  Five more.  They got dollars  that's coming up.  It's amazing.  And...  Hey, don't throw it too hard.  We want to see the rest of this.  Hey, can you speed this up  a little there?  Really, dude?  We're doing this...  We're doing this  as a goof.  Oh, he took a nickel  to the head.  That's got to be like  a rock to the rest of us.  Come on, man.  Take your clothes off.  We are getting  pulpy by...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey, no throwing shit  or you will be removed  from the fucking place  and that's no shit.  All right.  Hold on. 
[00:37:30]  His bodyguard shot him.  I saw that, motherfucker.  Yeah.  All right.  He has a classic  security haircut.  Hey, you know how  I usually boo people  from PalTalk?  Oh, look.  Rick Fox ran on the stage  to collect all the dollar bills.  chill.  Yeah.  What are you, insane?  Do you know,  if you throw shit, 
[00:38:00]  keep it at the midget,  not at us.  Jesus Christ.  Are you crazy?  Yeah, how bad is your aim  that you hit us  instead of the midget?  Do you honestly think if I get hit with something, this is like a big pal talk room.  If I get hit with something, you'll be bounced.  Literally.  All right.  No throwing shit.  Now the midget really has low self-esteem.  All right, he's back to pick up his belongings.  He's picking up his stuff.  And he's out of the air.  Pick up your cash there. 
[00:38:30]  It's all yours.  You earned it.  He's got to kick it.  All your money.  There you go.  It's very hard for him to pick up money with those balloon fingers.  Pick my self-respect up right there, too.  Yeah.  Hey, before we take our first break, we've got to introduce everybody to one more person from the radio program.  He doesn't do much, but he looks really, really silly.  Let's hear it for half a Hulk face.  No way.  Half a Hulk face.  All right, half a Hulk face.  Live at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That is not a Halloween mask, everybody. 
[00:39:00]  That's the real deal.  Half a Hulk face.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  How are you?  How you been?  Good?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  Are you drunk?  I don't know why.  Look, I need a damn drink.  That's right.  Give me a damn drink.  This motherfucker's a rock star.  I love to get drunk.  Keep this guy in that booze.  Drink.  Drink, be merry, and fuck everybody else.  That's right.  Wow, I've never seen more cameras go off in my life.  Yeah, come on.  Get this guy half shit-faced.  There you go. 
[00:39:30]  Let's go.  I don't want to hear it.  I want to get drunk, damn it.  I want to drink.  Half a Hulk face.  Move to the edge of the stage.  Everyone wants to take your picture there.  Get close.  They love you.  They love you.  Blah, blah, blah.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I love the chance.  Oh, holy shit, man.  He said, you got loser.  Oh, wow.  Oh, hey.  Challenge you.  Don't act like you didn't hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you. 
[00:40:00]  We forgot to tell him that half a Hulk face has an attitude.  Yeah.  I know.  He don't take the other stuff.  That's what I thought.  I thought the mission lives in this side.  He don't take any shit.  There you go.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  I think it's going to pour out the other side of his mouth.  What's he going to do?  Drink it through a line?  There he goes.  He's chugging a beer for the crowd.  Half a Hulk face.  There he goes.  There you go.  And, Opie, wouldn't you.  He just turned the crowd around. 
[00:40:30]  Wouldn't you just be drinking all the time?  That was good.  It's filling his jaw like a pelican.  All right.  Half a Hulk face, everyone.  Hey, he's going to be hanging out.  You see him out there.  Buy him a beer.  Buy him a drink because wouldn't you want one, really?  Wouldn't you drink all day?  I think this is what's going to happen.  We're going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we're going to do a little karaoke, right?  Karaoke was a big hit down at your brother's place.  F.H. Riley's.  And we're bringing it here live to you. 
[00:41:00]  Is Stalker Patty here?  Is Stalker Patty in the house?  Because when she sang White Rabbit, oh, my goodness.  It was wonderful.  Where's Stalker Patty?  Where's Stalker Patty?  There she is.  Way back there.  We're going to take a little break.  Wait.  This is what I want to see happen before the break, though.  Let's lift her up in the air and bring her to the stage.  Yeah.  You guys just pass Stalker Patty over the crowd until she hits the stage.  Throw her like a dart.  Here we go.  Stalker Patty's in the back of the room. 
[00:41:30]  They're lifting her up.  Lift her up on the crowd.  Let her crowd surf to the stage.  Oh, please.  I'm afraid.  Come on, Stalker Patty.  Someone from the back of the crowd lift her up.  Here we go.  We're bringing Stalker Patty to the stage.  Oh, here she goes.  Get her up on the crowd.  She doesn't want to be lifted up.  Come on, Patty, you pussy.  I don't want to be lifted up.  I'm 50.  My hip could snap.  They're going to try to carry me like a bowling ball.  And there she is. 
[00:42:00]  Stalker Patty, everyone.  What do you want me to do?  When we get back, Stalker Patty will be doing karaoke.  She's going to do White Rabbit.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from the Hard Rock Cafe for St. Patty's Day, baby.  It's a traditional Irish step dancing party featuring Opie and Anthony and a kettle of little leprechauns.  Stop it.  It's an ONA St. Patty's Day live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  So go fuck your mother with tenors.  As I was going over the far-fake Kerry Mountains, I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting. 
[00:42:30]  I first produced me Pistol and I then produced me Rager.  Thanks that is a deliver for you are a bold deceiver.  A shrink, no do not.  Why far the value?  Why far the value is received? 
[00:43:00]  I count the doubtless money when it made a produce of hate.  Of course it has.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  We can't even hear ourselves think up here on the stage. 
[00:43:30]  No.  Oh, it's a clusterfuck, but we're having a goddamn good time at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That'll happen.  I can't hear anything.  It's our St. Paddy State broadcast.  There we go.  There we go.  Ow.  I don't know what made the radio.  I just know we're back live, I guess, right?  Okay.  I'm going to have no hearing by the time this is done.  It goes from you can't hear anything, and then all of a sudden, bam, you get full volume.  Jet airplane.  Exactly.  Wonderful.  Well, I'm looking at the PalTalk cam.  It is now up.  The Opie and Anthony live room is open.  And someone's roving around and roaming around with a laptop, with a camera. 
[00:44:00]  And I see them somewhere in the middle of the crowd right now.  Where are they over there?  There he is.  Yeah, so for the people that couldn't make it here, they can see all the festivities right here on PalTalk.  And, you know, we've got to admit, we only have four or five listeners.  Howard was right.  Howard was right.  Yeah.  We have four or five listeners and a racist comic.  Oh, by the way, Howard Stern did not work today. 
[00:44:30]  He did not work on the radio today.  No.  He would rather hang out.  We would rather hang out with our fans and do a fucking party.  There you go.  And you know what I call him for that?  Lucky bastard.  I mean.  Hey, where are the bagpipes?  Here they come.  Oh, no.  Yes.  What St. Paddy's Day would be complete without some bagpipes?  Wow.  I feel like we're announcing a parade. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Like a cop died or some shit?  Yeah.  Opia's Garfield makes its way down the street.  This is wonderful.  We're sitting here parade side.  And, oh, thank you.  Look at the details.  Look at the details of the float.  It's just amazing.  Isn't that fantastic?  And, of course, here comes the Nike float.  This one's sponsored by Nike.  And, remember, these guys are always tough. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  They always look like they'll fuck you up.  Like these bagpipes motherfuckers.  Actually, Anthony, we're listening to the guard.  Hey, guy.  What's with the skirt?  Excuse me?  Serving Morris and Somerset counties.  Wonderful.  Go to www.tgpd.org.  Hey, what percentage of their gigs do you think are funerals?  Half.  Easy.  And half is St. Paddy's Day.  Parades and funerals. 
[00:46:00]  Too bad Norton's not here.  Men in dresses.  All right.  You guys do it all day?  I mean.  They're good.  I like that guy's tapping his foot.  I don't know where the beat is in this.  They all sound the same.  A toast.  A toast.  Hey, you guys drink Jaeger?  Yeah, we want to thank Jaeger Meister.  Hi.  We're supplying some of the alcohol at the Hard Rock Cafe today. 
[00:46:30]  Got a nice little shot girl handing out the Jaeger Meister shots.  Let's get some fucking Jaeger.  Best.  Happy St. Paddy's Day, you animals.  And there you go.  Another shot of Jaeger Meister down the old gullet.  Ah, drinking on the air.  It's not early, early in the morning.  It's almost like the old days, Obi.  It certainly is.  All right.  Let's hear it for these guys.  The pipes and drums.  The guard. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Maybe another little tune to walk yous off the stage with.  They can tell them to play the long version of Edna Gata DeVita.  How long is that?  22 minutes?  Hit it, baby.  We can use that at this point.  Hey, play the guitar riff for fucking Hotel California.  We can use that at this point. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  There they go.  Grab one of those philosophy bags.  Semper Fi. 
[00:48:00]  Once again, it's the guard, pipes and drums, serving Morris and Somerset Counties.  www.tpd.org.  More than 100 years of piping experience.  There they go.  Bravo, gentlemen.  Do you guys do Jay-Z?  I know.  It's one of my favorite songs.  That is probably the antithesis of the anti-black music.  All right.  That was great.  That was like my favorite.  Black guys, that's one thing they've never incorporated into like hip-hop or anything is 
[00:48:30]  bagpipes.  White guy.  White guy dress music.  Is that what it is?  White power.  White power.  That's right.  White power.  Celtic crosses and everything.  That's fantastic.  That's right.  That's right.  I think we're ready for Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty, come on.  Back out here.  We can do this late night karaoke at FH Riley's.  Yeah, she is.  Patty.  I love Patty.  And why don't we get the Pal Talk guy up on stage with the camera so we can get a good 
[00:49:00]  view of Patty doing this tune, man.  Is the titty girl Patty's daughter?  No, you have to get fucked to have a daughter.  Oh, Patty, you got to show them your tits first.  That's right.  Oh, geez, we forgot Patty.  We forgot Patty.  You got to show everyone your tits.  You know what the sad thing is?  I've seen her completely naked.  That is really sad that you can even say that.  Go ahead, Patty.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Go ahead, Patty.  What do you want me to do?  Flash in the crowd.  One, two. 
[00:49:30]  There you go.  All right.  Those are 50-year-old tits.  Was her pants pulled up over her titty?  Somebody got hit in the eye by a hair.  That was beautiful, Patty.  All right, listen.  Oh, half a Hulk face is on the Paltalk camera right now.  It's frightening.  It's like I'm watching the hills have eyes.  Will you come play with me?  Why don't we get the Paltalk camera up here so you can get Patty.  All right, the Paltalk camera is making his way up. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, making his way up.  And let's have Patty sing her eerie rendition of White Rabbit.  White Rabbit.  Yeah, she did this during late night karaoke.  It was a hit.  We figured we'd bring it to the rest of the country today.  Are we all set?  Is Paltalk up on stage?  Working their way back now.  All right, slowly but surely making their way to the stage.  One pill makes you larger and one makes you small.  And the one that I got makes you a worthless piece of shit. 
[00:50:30]  Doesn't rhyme, but it's accurate.  Is that the Boss Loves Cock chant?  It's not out of nowhere.  Where did that come from?  It's a new one.  Boss Loves Cock.  It's not a new one.  It's not a party until you hear this chant, I got to tell you.  First of all, there's 300 guys.  I love Cobb.  Oh, are you going to take that?  Are you going to take that? 
[00:51:00]  It's 300 guys for you.  Good for you, Rich.  You got balls.  300 guys.  And he loves Cobb.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, Katrina.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  He got you.  I mean, let's be fair.  All right, Patty is very confused on the stage,  so I think we should get her singing her song.  All right, Patty. 
[00:51:30]  Patty, move closer to the monitor there, all right?  Patty, can you read?  Yeah, I can.  Oh, from there?  Yeah.  Wow, your eyes work, huh?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  With those glasses, Corey gave her colors.  All right, here we go.  Stalker Patty doing White Rabbit, everyone.  One bill makes you larger, and one bill makes you small, and the one sad mother needs you. 
[00:52:00]  You don't do anything at all.  Go ask Gallus when she's 10 feet tall. 
[00:52:30]  And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall,  Just hear it, Charlie.  Just hear it, Charlie.  All of the smoking caterpillar has given you the call.  Call Alice when she was just a small.  When the man on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go. 
[00:53:00]  And you just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving on.  Go ask Gallus.  I think she'll know.  When logic and proportion have the head to be fed, and then white knight is talking backwards, 
[00:53:30]  And the red queen's off of her head.  You smoke this shit to escape from reality?  I am reality.  I am reality.  I am reality.  I am reality.  I'm sad.  I tuck it down, BC.  We want it.  Yeah.  We want it.  Yeah.  We want it. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Bring it down the house.  Salker Patty at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, I'm doing another one, baby.  Let me do it again.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Bad Patty.  In the white room.  With black birds, huh?  Damn, Patty.  Wow.  Gotta give it to Salker Patty.  It's like Grey Slick.  It's like watching Grey Slick.  That's what they call me.  I'm sad in different colors and shit.  That was fantastic.  Wow.  Very nice.  That was fucking psychedelic, man.  That was good.  What, Bill?  She did.  She did.  She did.  She did.  She did. 
[00:54:30]  She did.  She did.  She did.  She did.  That was good.  What, Bill?  She did that better than Grey Slick could at this point.  Oh, absolutely.  She's, uh, I think she's in line for the next generation.  Like a Jefferson Chrysler.  Right?  Whatever they're calling it these days.  It's like when that guy quit Judas Priest.  Yeah.  He just grabbed somebody random.  Throw someone new in.  She kind of has a Grey Slick now look to her.  Yeah.  Punched over.  She still has that hippie body.  Right.  That big nasty push. 
[00:55:00]  Big Woodstock push.  Still got mud in it.  Don't take the brown ass and...  Hey, you guys, we forgot to introduce Schizo Bill to the crowd.  So?  And he's getting a little paranoid backstage, so we should bring him out here.  No, we already did that, Opie.  Did we?  Yeah, we already brought him out.  Schizo Bill got a little reprimand earlier right here.  Oh, whoa, two, boom.  He was trying to sell bootleg t-shirts. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, really?  This is somebody that's like in our organization trying to sell bootleg t-shirts to the crowd.  That's too good.  Well, let's bring him out here for a couple of minutes, you guys.  Yeah, if that was the Sopranos, he'd get whacked.  Absolutely.  Here comes Schizo Bill.  Look at him.  This guy's the real deal, man.  How you doing, Bill?  I'm doing great.  How you doing, Bill? 
[00:56:00]  I'm doing great.  Hey, Bill, how you doing?  I'm doing great.  Someone get me a beer.  Somebody get Schizo Bill a beer.  Hey, Bill, can you actually zip that up?  Don't throw shit.  Don't throw shit.  I see everything.  Schizo Bill doing his shot of Jägermeister, Anthony.  I'm really not supposed to drink.  Oh, really?  Oh, with the medication?  Oh, thanks for telling me now.  Hey, Anthony.  Great crowd control.  Don't throw shit.  But I ran out of that months ago.  It's my job as a comedian to make you laugh.  It's my duty as a schizophrenic to scare you.  I hear Schizo Bill.  He is facing the crowd now.  Give a little of your act. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, do a little of your act, Schizo Bill.  Ladies and gentlemen, come to the stage right now.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.

All the schizophrenics thought they were Jesus.  They all drowned.  What's your mind, Schizo?  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Bill.  Do your act.  Do your act.  Do your act.  Do your act.  I'm trying to do it.  They're being rude.  That's okay.  You've got to be a professional.  Pretend you're at the Apollo.  Do your act. 
[00:57:30]  Plug shit when you're done.  That's exactly what I was in the room.  Wait.  No, no, no.  I'm doing my act.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come on.  Bill, for the love of God, do your act.  Hey, hey.  Bill, it might just be my opinion, but I think you're losing the crowd.  All right, try one more time.  Get in there, Bill.  Get in there.  Come on.  Come on, Bill.  Give him your opening joke.  When I was in the mental hospital, I used to forget things after I got shot treatment.  Like some really creepy guy, Elaine Jep, you soon. 
[00:58:00]  All right, you've got to tighten it up, Bill.  Hey, boss.  Tell him what to do when this happens.  You know.  I'll tell you what to do.  Run.  Boss sucks.  Boss sucks.  All right.  Oh.  Boss sucks.  Boss sucks.  Boss sucks.  He's leaning the back.  Boss sucks.  Boss sucks.  He turned him on rich.  Oh, what a dirtbag move.  I know.  All right.  Great.  He tried to charge me through to a gas set at the Improv. 
[00:58:30]  He tried to charge me.  Yeah, he tried to charge me.  He's so an anti-Semitic.  Yeah.  You aren't part of my t-shirt sale.  And the hard rock won't sell me, sell my t-shirts, and I'm running out of medication money.  You son of a devil.  That's it.  Expose him.  I told him.  I put him on stage.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait.  What's the party?  First of all.  Piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  All right.  Hold on.  Anthony.  What the hell's going on? 
[00:59:00]  He tried to exploit the retard.  He said he would never do that.  He wanted another shot.  I want another shot.  No, you can't have me.  I want another shot.  He's accusing Boss of charging me for a spot.  Get the bill at MySpace.com.  Yeah, he is.  He's charging me for a comedy spot.  And his sister said, that's how you make it in comedy.  All hell is breaking loose.  You scum band Boss.  That's a scandal.  Oh, my God.  Really busted apart the Jewish experience.  MySpace.com.  Get the bill.  MySpace.com.  Get the bill. 
[00:59:30]  He said he's trying to get a piece of his t-shirt, Sam.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get Schizzo Bill off this thing.  Wait a minute.  There's something important to have to say.  Fucking Humphrey.  There's a benefit for me.  Get him off this.  There he goes.  Isn't it supposed to be men in white coats to take him away?  Not well-dressed suits.  Do you believe he did that?  I mean, I know he fucked, but that's unbelievable.  You charged him money, Rich?  No, no.  I have scandal.  And this needs to be uncovered right now.  We need to address this.  We need to address this.  Here's what happened.  He's got comics got to pay their dues. 
[01:00:00]  They don't have to pay you.  Well, you know, it's like when I sponsor people, I got to pay D&A and what the fuck.  He wants to get up.  Rich, did you spend all your last comic standing money?  No, I'm loaded.  Here's the deal.  We were backstage, and I was being nice.  Listeners, for real.  Why did you sew part of your boxer to your eyes on?  First of all, I'm going to cut myself on this.  All right.  Are we back here or what?  All right.  I have no idea what the hell's making the radio.  All I know, there's accusations flying by. 
[01:00:30]  Schizo Bill was trying to exact.  Voss said something, and then Schizo Bill attacked Voss.  And he got called a piece of shit.  I think he made a piece of shit move.  We can hear all the mics now.  What happened?  Voss was charging.  He charged Schizo Bill.  He said he wanted a piece of his T-shirt sale that is show.  And he charged to go on.  I believe Schizo Bill.  Did you see the look in his eye?  It wasn't crazy.  He was a hurt man.  Yeah.  And then he said, he's a piece of shit, right?  Piece of shit. 
[01:01:00]  This is fucking great.  You're the worst.  I fucking got up at 8 o'clock for this, you motherfuckers.  What did you make from him?  10 bucks?  He was fucking an asshole.  And I made him sell my D.  I was in Cleveland coming up, and I said to him,  if you want to come in, you can do a guest spot.  Okay.  And then Bonnie backstage said,  but if you show shirts, we take the money.  Fucking with him.  And he's really believing it.  He's fucking doing my butt.  Oh, no.  Can Bonnie do your bidding for you? 
[01:01:30]  No, she's backing it up.  You cheap fuck.  No, he's like Kobe, bringing up Shaq right now.  Right, right.  I'm trying to be nice and give a nice, young,  schizo comic a guest spot.  All right, we're going to move on.  We got a special guest at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, yeah.  You guys, let's hear it for the Hogan family.  Hulk Hogan and his family.  Get the fuck.  This is real Hulk Hogan.  Oh, yeah.  That's real Hulk Hogan.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:00]  There he is.  You're a legend, man.  Oh, fucking Hulk.  Oh, there it is.  That's beautiful.  Hi, girls.  Oh, I don't have a camera.  Oh, I am.  Kobe.  Let's meet you, Terry.  Take a seat wherever you can.  The Hulk is posing and the place is going nuts.  The Hulk.  Oh, do we get out? 
[01:02:30]  He's getting out.  He's just working the crowd in there.  Loving it.  Take a seat, Mr. Hogan.  That's all right.  Anyone will do.  There's a couple of mics down there, too.  A couple of mics down there.  But disrespect in front of Hulk.  Wow. 
[01:03:00]  Hulk wants his wife a flash.  Holy crap.  That was really funny, man.  Hulk pointed at his wife and said, flash the crowd.  You know, Hulk, what you have to put up with, having a very attractive daughter like this. 
[01:03:30]  That's cool, brother.  But let me tell you something.  If my wife dropped those bombs out, you guys would be passing out backwards.  What's going on over there, Anthony?  I don't know.  I think she was threatening.  You're going to whip the crowd into a frenzy with that body.  Hulk, wouldn't it have been easier for you to have ugly children? 
[01:04:00]  Do you think it would have been easier for your life?  Brother, thank God they look like my wife, you know.  Thank God.  Yeah, but I think it would have been easier instead of having to have these guys trying to pick up on her and stuff.  It's your daughter.  It's your little girl.  And you've got to put up with these guys that you obviously know aren't good enough.  Yeah, but Vince McMahon doesn't want me beating up the young punks in the WWE.  I could beat up all these guys if they messed with my daughter, man.  That's true. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, do you like this?  What are these guys like?  We're crazy.  We're crazy.  We're crazy.  But now you have had to deal with her dates, with guys coming over.  Yeah, it's been crazy, brother.  But, you know, she's almost 18, so you animals wait a couple more months and she'll be street legal.  Hey, what are you promoting her?  Any ideas about maybe nude posing?  In all respect, Mr. Hogan, any nude photography when you turn 18? 
[01:05:00]  I don't know about nude, but there's definitely going to be maybe Maxim or stuff.  Maxim, one of those hot bikini layouts.  Does it make you uncomfortable at all that she's very comfortable with her body and willing to show it like that?  And you're her dad, man.  Well, I mean, you know, it hadn't been shown so far, so we're still deep, deep under the radar, you know.  So, so far, so good.  But we've seen enough where, you know, we get that mental image.  Hulk, not that I have myself.  I haven't, you know, watched the show, seen your daughter, and then maybe put it in the Rolodex in your head for later use. 
[01:05:30]  But I assume other guys have.  Does that, how does that make you feel?  Well, every time our show, Hogan knows best, which, this Sunday night, brother, 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock on VH1.  The new episodes.  Every time our show airs, Brooke's website blows up with all these guys wanting to know her size is, where she's going to be, where she's singing at.  It gets pretty crazy.  Plus, Mrs. Hogan, my wife, Playboy, you want me to wrestle my wife? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they won another match.  Come on, let's hear it.  Another match.  Anthony, I just got a note from backstage.  Twitchels wants Hulk to chop him.  Are you shitting me?  Hulk, would you do a little move with Twitchels for the crowd?  No, brother, no.  No more lawsuits.  Yeah, he's had enough of lawsuits.  He's had enough of those.  I don't want to stop his heart.  You would do him a favor, though.  He has Tourette's.  It's this guy right here.  It might cure him.  Twitchels, come over here and say hi to Hulk Hogan. 
[01:06:30]  He's a big fan.  He's a comedian, and he's the real deal.  He has Tourette's.  He has Tourette's.  He has Tourette's.  He's got to shake everyone's hands.  Whenever he hears the word jump, he feels compelled to jump.  And the crowd, of course, is very sympathetic to that.  They yell it out every two seconds.  Twitchels, how are you feeling meeting Hulk?  Say that again?  How are you feeling meeting the Hulkster?  I thought I had Tourette's really bad before.  I'm fucking nervous around you.  Crack! 
[01:07:00]  Crack!  Hey!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  You're going to tire him out.  I thought it would be a great honor to get chopped by Hulk.  First of all, if he'd kill you, you understand you would die.  And it might be the better of the two lives that he's living right now. 
[01:07:30]  He's very strong.  Yeah.  Now, Hulk, you were saying...  All right, Twitchels.  All right.  Enough.  You were saying about your wife now.  I thought we forgot about all that.  No.  No.  We don't forget.  She don't.  Lovely woman.  Been married to her for 22 years.  Never had a fight.  Everything's cool.  Really?  22 years.  What's it like for her, though, to be married to this guy for 22 years?  It's been a very exciting road, I'll tell you, because I was with him all through the WWF years. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  We did a lot of traveling.  Stopped.  Had kids up.  She's showing her her tits.  Isn't that great?  We said she looks like Harry Potter showing tits.  I think Nick likes this place.  This is all good.  Hey, Nick didn't see that.  Hulk's son, Nick, needs to see that thing.  Now he's happy.  Now we got Nick involved.  Hey, Nick, it's St. Patrick's today, you know?  Yeah.  It's a special occasion. 
[01:08:30]  Good enough reason.  Very special.  This place, as you know, used to be WWE.  Yeah, this place was wild.  I remember they had, when I came in here, it was back in the Ted Turner days when the NWO was running for life, man.  I came in here to eat one day.  All the WWF superstars were in here, and there was not one Hulk Hogan picture anywhere.  That's because we were down in the south doing the NWO thing.  But then we made peace, and everything's good now.  Me and Opie have a history with this place also. 
[01:09:00]  Do you know that we were the pre-game show hosts for the XFL?  Well, wow.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a bad train to know where.  That train never left the station.  Unbelievable.  Vince McMahon picked us personally, though.  Yeah.  Anthony, don't forget.  Thanks.  Hey, the new season of Hogan Knows Best, what can we expect?  Well, we can expect more chaos.  Brooke's trying to break away.  Nick is using the cameras to his advantage.  He's got all kind of game. 
[01:09:30]  He's running with these 18, 19-year-old girls, so it's game on with Nick.  And we made friends with the camera crew, so we don't even know the camera's there anymore.  And, I mean, it gets pretty heavy this year, so you guys are going to be surprised.  Yeah.  Bravo, man.  I was wondering, I know Sylvester Stallone's making Rocky Balboa.  Did he ask you to be any part of that because he's such a huge part of the first one?  Well, you know, Rocky III was great, but I kind of think it was weird when Stallone first went on the talk circuit, like on Johnny Carson and all those shows. 
[01:10:00]  When you talk about Rocky III, they keep asking about Thunderlips, and I think it got to the point where they don't want any more Thunderlips, you know, because it kind of like overshadowed the rest of the movie.  But he's a good friend.  He inducted me into the Hall of Fame last year, and I wish him all the best.  Yeah, it looks like it's going to be a pretty good movie.  And looking forward to the next season.  Well, thank you so much, guys.  This is awesome to have us out here.  You've got a great crowd of your own, man.  You've got a great following here.  Hey, can I say something?  The past.  I really just don't think this day would be complete unless with a crowd like this here in New York City, Times Square, that Hulk Hogan needs to stand up here and tear off his shirt for you people. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's a photo op.  Come on, baby.  Let's see the crab down the whole thing.  No, man.  Come on.  Don't show those pythons.  Come on.  Let's do it.  Yeah, that's just like seeing Brooke.  If you can't get Brooke, we'll get some.  We'll give him a couple posies.  We'll give him a couple posies.  All right.  All right.  Here comes Hogan.  All right.  To the front of the stage.  Hulk Hogan. 
[01:11:00]  Hogan knows best this Sunday at 10 p.m. on VH1.  Bravo.  He's making his way to the front of the stage, Anthony.  Come on, baby.  Everybody misses you.  He's silent in his fucking arms, man.  All right, Hulkster.  There he is.  Hulk Hogan.  Oh, man.  He needs to hear more noise, you guys. 
[01:11:30]  You got some fans up in the back there, baby.  Come on.  I don't hear him.  It doesn't sound like masks or a garden.  Come on.  Pump it up.  Let's go.  You can do better than that.  Come on.  Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan. 
[01:12:00]  Hulk Hogan.  All right, Brooke, it's your turn.  My turn?  Yeah, your turn.  Now it's Brooke's turn, everyone.  Come on.  I can do it?  Yeah, you can do it. 
[01:12:30]  You can do it.  Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan, Hogan,  Come on, you can do it.  She can't bring me security.  You need someone to use their teeth?  I don't think I can do it.  But do you guys want this?  Oh, now they're throwing the Hulk Hogan t-shirt into the crowd.  Yeah.  Here's Hulk Hogan's daughter, Brooke, making her way to the front of the crowd.  One, two, three.  They work the crowd the same way, man. 
[01:13:00]  She learned from daddy.  There you go.  Oh, the guy caught him with his crutch.  Oh, my God.  He caught him with his crutch.  Caught him with his crutch.  What a catch.  And now he's going to need it.  Pandemonium here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Damn, Hulk, you know how to work the crowd, bro.  All right.  There's some crazy Opie and Anthony Hulkamaniacs out there, brother. 
[01:13:30]  Absolutely.  That was a pretty hot catch.  My brother right there.  They love you, man.  You guys are awesome, man.  All right.  Let's hear it, you guys, for Hulk Hogan and his family.  Hogan knows best this Sunday, 10 p.m. on VH1.  Thank you so much.  We appreciate it.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue with our St. Paddy's Day show at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Top of the morning to you.  I'm Seamus McFaddy, the little leprechaun with a big, delicious prize waiting for you in me trousers. 
[01:14:00]  Join the Opie and Anthony show for a generous portion of corned beef and a pint while we gather at the Opie.  I love it.  It's another St. Patrick's Day celebration with Opie and Anthony.  Live.  I've been a wild rover for many years a year  I've spent all the money on whiskey and beer that's missing  But now I'm returning with gold and great store  And I never will play the wild rover no more 
[01:14:30]  And it's no, hey, never  No, hey, never, no more  Will I play the wild rover  No, hey, never, no more  I went in to an end  And we're back at the Hard Rock Cafe for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  What a mess.  But we're having a good time.  We want to say hi to Damien Fahey from TRL on MTV joining the program.  Had a great time last time you were on the show.  We had a good time last time.  I believe Twitchells was there.  Hey, what about Hulk Hogan?  Bill Burr was starstruck.  All of us were starstruck to meet Hulk Hogan.  I had to get a picture.  I was like Jim Norton.  I literally stood there like a little bitch waiting for him to come out. 
[01:15:30]  You did.  I really did and I'm not going to apologize.  Well, he's one of the most well-known people.  You know, you see him.  You know it's Hulk.  You got to get a picture with him.  Best Fu Manchu ever?  Fu Manchu ever.  Who else is wearing the Fu Manchu?  And then the guns.  I'm sitting here.  It was so embarrassing.  The guy's sitting next to me and his arms are like holiday hams.  And like this thing is dangling next to his.  And I look like just like 18 of my arms to make up one of his. 
[01:16:00]  So embarrassing.  That's a man's man.  I'm a man's man.  That's a real man.  I'm robbing that nigga.  And I'm a faggot.  Stick that nigga up.  But I have switched to Guinness.  There you go.  Happy St. Paddy's Day.  Hi.  Anthony raising his glass of Guinness to the crowd.  All right.  Hey, I think we're ready for more karaoke, huh?  Yes, we have Stalker Paddy do White Rabbit.  A great rendition.  Renable. 
[01:16:30]  It gave me an acid flashback and I never even took acid.  That's how strong her performance was of that song.  But now I think it's time to bring it down a little, people.  Maybe a song about love.  And who could sing that?  A song about love.  Yeah.  Oh, they're calling for him.  Yep.  You guys, let's hear it for Master Poe making his way to the stage.  Master Poe.  Every karate killer has a salt sign. 
[01:17:00]  That's it.  Poe playing up to the crowd right now, Anthony.  He looks like he's hosting the grind.  Hey, nigga.  Remember that show?  Hey, let me tell y'all something.  Bruce Lee sang Stairway to Heaven at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  Don't you ever forget that shit.  Did he?  I don't know.  Naked shit up.  Who cares?  Why not?  Master Poe.  Get Master Poe a mic.  Hey, Chuck Norris plays the violin, nigga. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, guys, I have to do it.  I'm sorry.  There he goes.  Now he's all out of breath.  He's going to be like Axl Rose when he did his comeback.  We know what he's going to say right here.  Hit it.  Pony Pony Rose!  His battle cry.  It's his battle cry, yes.  That is the battle cry, the catchphrase.  His Jeff Foxworthy moment.  Here's my ladies in the hand.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, man.  I want my ladies to come out.  Oh, yeah.  No offense with you guys, but I'm not singing to you.  Oh, yeah.  You're not cute enough.  He's got chalk dust in the back of his...  He must have beat up a teacher.  Poe is the man who will fight for your eyes.  I need to do a lot more.  Poe could be your hero.  All right, Master Poe's got three girls on tour. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, look at that ass in the middle.  Oh, look at that ass in the middle.  Look at that ass in the middle.  Ladies, please.  And when a master comes along.  Sexy, huh?  All right, here we go.  Master Poe's singing a love song, everybody.  Live at the Hard Rock Cafe.  I need my soul when it changes my mind.  Sad things he's serious.  It's the one that I lost my mind.  He's dreaming.  It's half okay.  It's so bad, right?  It's half all right.  And I never said how much I need you to do. 
[01:19:00]  This is why he learned karate, because he really likes this song.  Yeah.  I sure need you.  Yeah, when this is blasting out your windows or your car, you've got to know how to kick  ass.  My love.  Yeah.  Just sing in a round.  You don't even need the words, nigga.  You don't need the television.  Fuck the words.  Fuck that television.  Oh, he knows it by heart.  Master Richie.  Look at him. 
[01:19:30]  He's playing to the girls in the crowd.  Leaning down, singing into a girl's eyes right now.  And now he's gouging them out with his own fingers to show he's still a comfortable expert.  Oh, someone's making out, too, right there.  Yeah, there's a couple making out.  He's creating romance.  He's inspiring the love of the people.  Yeah.  With his soprano's haircut.  Yeah, folks.  The girls are swooning. 
[01:20:00]  That's right.  Come on, grab her ass.  That's right, folks.  You ain't gonna lose to my fight and leave it.  I'm sick of letting you stay.  My son.  Yeah, folks.  Just sing about you, baby. 
[01:20:30]  Just blows my mind.  They got a nice little rub in the middle.  They got their lighters out, Anthony.  My son.  You know, and that's coincidental.  Massapolk could kill you with a lighter in under three seconds.  Just blows my mind.  Oh.  There's a guy calling him a faggot, too.  That's a...  I actually like that.  That's someone that's real smart.  Only party rock.  Taking a chance. 
[01:21:00]  Better than I thought.  Yeah.  Better than I thought.  My friend is here and my lover.  Oh, yeah.  The performance is absolutely dreadful.  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.  You made my love so strong.  I know where I belong.  Oh, girl.  Oh.  Poe's getting action. 
[01:21:30]  Poe is getting action.  He's got the choreography and everything.  Perfect, man.  He can sing and they feel safe.  That's what women want.  Poe, do the two-finger kiss to the crowd, baby.  Yeah, two-finger kiss to the crowd.  Yeah, Poe.  Yeah, Poe.  Middle of the song, applause break.  Lionel Richie never got that.  Just close my mind. 
[01:22:00]  Nigga, fuck one-finger push-ups.  Thanks for a listen.  My love.  Just speaking about you.  That chick's got her shirt off.  Just close my mind.  Oh, God.  He's doing his splits.  He's doing splits.  Yeah.  Nuts are on the stage.  That's so he can hit the high notes.  Here you go, Poe.  How about that for some egg protein for you, buddy?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  That was nice.  Mr. Poe, everyone.  Master Poe.  Yeah, Poe.  Remember to vote for Poe.  It's 1-800-4-IDOL-08.  08.  That wasn't bad.  You got to give him props for that.  It was great.  And your boy's still on.  Right.  That little goofy motherfucker is still on.  All right.  There you go.  Master Poe leaving the stage.  I think Master Poe has what it takes to be the next American Idol. 
[01:23:00]  He can kick ass and sing.  Congratulations.  You're going to New Brunswick.  Hey, Anthony, we got to introduce Neo is God to the crowd, by the way.  Oh, wow.  Neo's here.  We got a celebrity in the front row we haven't introduced yet.  Yep.  Can we get him on the stage?  Yeah, let's try to lift him up.  If possible.  Fucking asshole.  Online, this guy's a killer, an assassin.  Just as deadly as Poe online. 
[01:23:30]  This is Neo is God.  Neo.  Working the stage right now.  What's up, Neo?  Good to see you again, buddy.  Turn around for a little photo op.  This is Neo.  Yeah, photo op.  Neo is God.  Bottom slash.  Wow.  He doesn't like you.  He doesn't like you.  He doesn't like you, Patrice.  Who gives a fuck?  He's got an American vest jersey on.  He's wonderful.  Oh, shit.  And it always looks like he's wearing Kevlar vests.  Yeah, I don't think he is.  That's just his chest.  Hey, Anthony, that DNA's a bitch. 
[01:24:00]  He looks like he's trying to shoplift a pot.  That DNA's a bitch.  Yeah.  You mix it up one way, you get a body like Hulk Hogan.  You mix it up another way, and you get Neo is God.  You know, it's the same principle.  A sperm hits an egg, later you have a Hulk Hogan,  or you have Neo.  God has a sense of humor, people.  Well, this sperm bounces off the egg.  This sperm hit the egg from the 50th floor.  Somebody missed it.  This thing.  Hey, wait, we want to see you without your shirt off, Neo. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's why the people came here to the Hard Rock Cafe.  Neo, you're disappointed.  You are the American mess.  You've got to show everyone.  He is.  All right, this is his encore.  He's an American mess.  All right, do you guys want to see Neo without his shirt on?  Yeah, why not?  It's a photo op.  It's a photo op, everybody.  That's right, Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, come on.  You thought that midget was hot.  He is the reigning American mess.  There you go.  Opie and Anthony have eyes.  Hey, it's Scoliope. 
[01:25:00]  And this is Scoliope also from American mess.  Scoliope, what's up?  He cut his hair, man.  He must have booked a part or something.  No, he didn't cut his hair.  He had another operation, probably.  Oh, yeah.  Way to bring it up, Bill.  Good to see you.  If we could have, let's do dueling pipe cleaner spines.  And have both of you get up there shirtless for the crowd.  A great photo op.  Hey, why don't you have them play Twister? 
[01:25:30]  By the way, this would not be the time to throw stuff into the crowd when we're trying  to get something going on here.  All right.  Yeah, hey, yeah.  There we go.  All right, gentlemen, if you would step a little closer to the stage so they could  get good photo ops and show them your goods.  All right.  It's Neo is God and Scoliope, everyone.  Scoliope.  They seem a little shy.  Yeah, they don't want to do it.  You know how many times they've done this in doctor's offices, but somehow in a small  atmosphere. 
[01:26:00]  Seems to be a problem.  See, they don't understand that.  Just standing on that cold scale.  Yeah.  Scoliope, you got to take your leather jacket off and your shirt for the crowd.  Holy shit.  Do they have hearing impairments to us?  I don't think they're listening to us.  Fucking Scoliope has a fucking dash and debonair.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He's dressed like Matthew McConaughey.  E-Rock, get it done.  Get it done.  Tell them what they have to do.  You guys might want to get your cameras ready for this photo op.  E-Rock's trying to work on it. 
[01:26:30]  That's E-Rock, everyone.  All right, here they go.  Now they know what we need from them.  Neo is God and Scoliope, everyone.  There comes the jersey.  There it is.  And here comes the t-shirt.  You might want...  He doesn't want to do it.  Scoliope ain't going to do it.  E-Rock's tapping out.  I don't want to look.  There it is.  All right, Neo, walk to the front of the stage so they get a good shot there.  There it goes.  Neo is God doing the Hulk. 
[01:27:00]  The Hulk posing.  The Hulk.  Wow.  That's like something out of a black and white textbook.  And there you have it.  Neo is God.  And Scoliope walks off with just a tad more dignity.  Yeah, Scoliope.  Wow.  The crowd too horrified to applaud.  By the way, you just saw the last appearance by Scoliope on our show.  Yeah, I think so.  Give him a hand. 
[01:27:30]  Give Neo is God a hand.  Why?  Because he has some self-respect, you motherfucker.  Exactly.  He has no room for self-respect on this fucking show.  He has stripped down his shoulder and his fucking spleen hanging out the side.  So he's out.  He's out.  We'll find someone to take his place.  We'll find somebody else flicked.  We'll find some other naked flickeded motherfucker that had a strip for you, you son of a bitch.  Hey, it's great to have dignity, buddy.  Is Ben reading his contract right now?  Let me tell you what dignity is to this program.  Like kryptonite to Superman, my friend. 
[01:28:00]  We can't have dignity.  Not on this show.  Scoliope says, fuck you.  You got to go with your assets, whatever they are.  Absolutely.  I'll take me in my eye, down in my chin, and go.  You didn't see half a Hulk face arguing.  Where is half a Hulk face?  I don't know.  His eye was running like Niagara Falls.  He's gone?  He's out of here?  And I think he left.  Yeah, he had an appointment.  Do you think he does that thing where he stands by the edge of a mirror and makes like, so you can see both halves. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, you know he's done that.  Yeah.  Running the side of a skyscraper.  Right.  He just cries.  That's how he hits on women.  Yeah.  Look at me.  He's just got to walk around with a mirror.  And he gets that number.  You got that in the date break drug.  You're all set.  What does Damien Fahey from TRL think of this whole mess?  I haven't seen nipples like that in a long time, actually.  Yeah.  Aren't they horrific? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Saveachild.com.  Yeah, but that shit now, they take care of it.  I saw a show they were putting titanium rods in people's back and spine and re-stretching them,  but you got to be like a year old when they do it.  Yeah.  He's past the point of no return, man.  He's a limited edition.  You'll never see people like that anymore.  It's over.  Like the dwarf.  There's only a few of them.  I remember growing up, dwarves all over the place.  They're going to be extinct very soon, is what you're saying.  Flipper-armed people.  You saw them all over way back when. 
[01:29:30]  Thalidomide babies.  They weed them out now.  They give them the old Francine in the toilet.  Pull out the tampon.  Boom.  The kid's gone.  You laugh your ass off.  You move on with your life.  By the way, Anthony, we got a situation here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  I don't know if we're allowed to do the hard-boiled egg-eating contest.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard there's some kind of health code.  Health code.  The Board of Health came by.  Because it is an eating establishment, and I think the eggs have to be certified in some  way, shape, or form before people can eat in here.  They said we don't have a permit.  Yeah, no egg-eating permit. 
[01:30:00]  We don't have a permit to allow people to puke.  Is that what it is?  A puke permit?  I have no idea.  Maybe four not to do that again.  I see Bob Kelly's to the side of the stage.  Here comes Bob.  We also have the Hamptons police want to come out with their bagpipes and do a little thing  before the end of the show.  Yeah, we can do that.  We'll allow them to come on.  And, of course, the grand finale, everyone lining up to tell their jokes.  Right, their jokes. 
[01:30:30]  They can be any kind of jokes you want.  Oh, no.  And we also have some more karaoke on the way, I guess.  Yes, I know.  I've been, people have been asking me all day if I'm going to be doing a little Neil  Diamond.  And, I don't know.  It's been horrific.  Do you want to hear Neil Diamond?  No, they don't want to hear.  Do you guys want to hear Anthony do Neil Diamond or what?  Yeah!  They, uh, should I do it? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah!  They're calling for you, Anthony.  Yeah!  And, quite frankly, we have nothing else to do with this radio show, so go waste four  minutes for us, buddy.  Go waste a couple minutes for us.  Hey, do the hour remix, Anthony.  Yeah, really.  Do the Peter Frampton version, will you?  It's great to be back here in New York.  Is that egg thing over?  Huh?  The egg thing's done?  I think so.  You're a wonderful crowd.  He's a big guy in the back of the scene.  And the guy from Celebrity Football. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, man, it's way back in time.  You might know her, and you might be able to sing along with this one.  Look at the look.  Look at the look on that guy's face.  Damien, check this out.  Anthony doing something.  I've heard that before.  I saw it came out when Anthony was 43.  All right, here we go, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  God bless you.  God bless you, people.  Where it began, I can't begin to know when, but then I know it's growing strong. 
[01:32:00]  Everybody was in the spring.  Everybody.  Then spring became the summer.  Who would have believed you'd come along?  Everybody. 
[01:32:30]  Hands.  Touching.  Touching hands.  Nice tits, lady.  Reaching out.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Sweet Caroline.  The times never seem so good.  I've been inclined. 
[01:33:00]  To believe in the world.  The worst-rested billionaire I've ever seen.  Now I look in the night.  And it don't seem so lonely.  We fill it up with only two.  Lovely.  And when I hurt.  When hurting runs off my shoulders. 
[01:33:30]  How can I hurt when holding you?  Everybody, how do you want to feel?  Warm.  Touching warm.  Touch my warm cock.  Reaching out.  Touching those tits.  Touching tits.  Sweet Caroline. 
[01:34:00]  f4 f4 f4.  The times never been so good.  f4 f4 f4.  I've been inclined.  f4 f4 f4.  If they believe they never were.  f4 f4 f4.  Oh, no, no, no.  A little musical interlude, ladies and gentlemen.  For me to tell you how much I've loved being here,  talking with everybody, singing to you people. 
[01:34:30]  It's a wonderful crowd.  In Caroline, the times never seemed so good.  I've been crying to believe they never would.  Oh, sweet Caroline, the times never seemed so good. 
[01:35:00]  I've been crying.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it for Anthony!  You made the song yours.  You made it yours.  There he is, your next American Idol, Anthony!  Most people would have sang that fucking song just like Neil Diamond. 
[01:35:30]  You made it yours.  I made it my own.  You made it your own?  I made it my own.  Hey, you guys want to hear the other side of the spectrum with this karaoke?  Of course.  I'm going to pass, but I'm going to bring up my brother.  Holy shit.  He's the best singer in my family.  Uh-oh.  You thought Anthony had pipes.  You thought Anthony had pipes.  That's my brother, Elmo, who designed the fine T-shirts that everyone is wearing. 
[01:36:00]  This song, this is going to sound a little different than what you just heard.  But quite enthusiastic here.  A toast.  Here's to you.  Here's to me.  And if I can't, we disagree.  Fuck my cousin Danny.  Here's to me.  Your brother's going to bomb. 
[01:36:30]  We already know he's going to bomb.  Watch that.  No, there's no doubt about it.  Am I ruining another bit?  Yes, you are.  You're just ruining it.  Ah.  Once again, he's...  This is for Kicking Moon on Mind's face.  Listen to these pipes, boys.  Yeah.  Oh.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh, look at the fleet of feet.  Irish people can't dance.  Does she talk? 
[01:37:00]  Does she talk to me?  That fucking bomb on the house is stuffing his face with beating.  Oh, it's Bob and the world.  Oh, it's a cunt.  He's a cunt.  He's a cunt.  We hate him.  Bob, you fucking cunt.  You're a cunt.  You're a fucking cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt. 
[01:37:30]  Cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  You're a cunt. 
[01:38:00]  Bob, you're a cunt.  Bob, you're a cunt.  There we go.  Oh, he's doing crab work. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, he's doing crab work. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, he's killing.  He's killing.  Now, he made that his own.  He really did.  Yeah.  A lot of guys can't lead the song and improv and come back in the way you're supposed to.  You know, dog, dog, I wasn't sure what to think of you from the start, dog, but you got me in the middle of the song. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, that's my brother, Elmo, everyone.  Wow.  You're a star.  I guess I can explain.  You're a star.  I guess I need to explain.  My brother takes it very seriously when people take shots at us.  I got it.  We told you on the show, he's nuts.  Yeah.  He wanted to fly to Chicago.  That's the guy who wanted to fly to Chicago and beat the shit out of Man Cow.  We're talking shit about us on Fox. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-huh.  So there you go.  That was some aggression that was building up in him, and he's the real deal.  I could see that on PLJ or another one of these commercial terrestrial radio stations.  That's the type of music they need.  What do you think of that?  Now, you see a lot of new music on TRL.  I think that needs to be available on iTunes very soon.  iTunes for download?  Yeah, I think so.  Absolutely.  You're going to be hearing a lot of people downloading that to their iPod.  I see it all over.  Yeah.  It's going to explode. 
[01:40:30]  Sweeping the nation.  Plus, who doesn't love a happy drunk?  Right.  Right.  Wow.  That's some aggression that's been building up.  Yeah.  He listens to the show every day, and he just gets more and more pissed off every day.  All right.  Once again, my brother, Elmo, what can I tell you?  I think we should get your mom up here to do, you know.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  She's shaking her head no already.  I can see from here.  If she had some wine spritzers during the time between she got here and now, we might see it. 
[01:41:00]  But I don't know.  Dawn?  Dawn, is there a clue that my mom might actually do Bobby McGee singing here?  She's shaking her head.  She's saying no.  Wow.  She's going to need a chiropractor.  She's shaking her head no so hard.  Wow.  No?  Because the crowd loves, you know.  Crowd's nice and warmed up.  She's retired from performing live.  She just doesn't want to follow that. 
[01:41:30]  She doesn't want to follow my brother.  Tremendous performance.  Ladies and gentlemen, Anthony's mom.  That's my mommy.  Mommy has hit the stage.  Hi, mommy.  And the bagpipes.

[01:57:00]  Satan laughing spreads his wings.  Oh Lord, yeah.  Yeah, let's hear it for Sammy.  Sammy, everyone, yes.  Representing Black Sabbath.  And the guy, the drunk guy, has officially fallen asleep on his feet. 
[01:57:30]  How do you fall asleep to Black Sabbath?  Yeah, Black Sabbath, big crowd yelling, and you fell asleep.  Don't look for the guy we're talking about.  It's you.  Yeah.  It's you.  You keep looking around like, where's this idiot they're talking about?  There are a bunch of drunk guys, but you are the drunk guy.  You are the drunk guy, dude.  They're all staring at you.  You are hammered.  What are you chewing on?  He's chewing on...  Yeah, you're not fucked up?  You were just asleep on your feet.  All right, here we go.  We're going to talk to the guy.  Oh.  Huh?  Not at all.  Not at all? 
[01:58:00]  Not at all.  You were asleep on your feet.  I was not.  Not at all.  What are you drinking over there in front of you?  It's pink.  The fucking shit's pink.  Did you realize remember?  You know what?  I get this guy.  You just go into denial.  This is like...  He's practicing for when the state troopers pull them over.  Right.  Get your own cranberry.  I don't drink 19 years.  Yeah?  He's like that normally?  Wow, dude.  Then you better go to a doctor.  He's not...  I should, right?  All right.  Fall asleep on my feet. 
[01:58:30]  I couldn't believe it.  All right.  Very good.  I'm sitting there with Matt Campbell with you.  I can't believe I'm not asleep.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  We're going to have the grand finale.  We got Twitchels who wants to sing New York for everybody.  Oh, everyone knows the words to that one.  To close out the show.  Also, what else we got?  Oh, we got people that are going to line up and tell their best jokes today.  Best jokes because that's what it's all about on St. Paddy's Day.  It's a tradition that we started last year.  We'll do it again this year.  It's Opie and Anthony and our pals live from the Hard Rock Cafe for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast. 
[01:59:00]  It's a traditional Irish step-dancing party featuring Opie and Anthony and a kettle of little leprechauns.  Oh, stop it.  It's an ONA St. Paddy's Day live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  So go fuck your mother.  Ten hours.  Well, in the merry month of Maine, I'm from me home.  I started left the girls and chew one nearly broken hearted saluted father dear. 
[01:59:30]  Kissed me darling mother, drank a pint of beer.  Me grief and tears to smothered enough to reap the corn and leaf where I was born.  Could a stout like corn and banished ghost and goblins a brand new pair of brofs.  To rattle up with the bogs and frighten all the dogs on the rocky roads.  It's a double of one, two, three, four, five, one to hair.  I turn them down the rocky roads and all the ways.  It's a double of Mike Palaldi-Gah.  In Mullingar the night I rested them.  So weary started by daylight.  It's morning to lay in there.  We took a drop of the pure.  The kiss of the heart is ringing.  That's the Paddy's cure when there is umph. 
[02:00:00]  I drink and they hear the last smile.  Laugh and all the while.  Happy, curious, girl.  All right.  I think we're back.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  It's our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  The Opie and Anthony show on XM satellite radio.  We got Patrice O'Neal making his way back to the stage.  We have Bill Burr up here.  And we haven't even really talked to him.  Bob Kelly is also helping us out today.  What's up, Bobby?  What's up, Bobby?  What's up, Bobby?  Is this on?  Yeah, it's on.  It's happening.  It's on.  I don't know how this sounds as a radio broadcast.  I've got to tell you, we're having a great time. 
[02:00:30]  Bob, this is like one of your holidays, right?  Bob Kelly.  Robert Patrick Kelly right here.  Dude.  It's not an ounce of Irish blood in him though.  Dude.  The crowd looks like it's Lenny Clark over and over and over again.  It's just a bunch of Lenny Clarks.  It's Lenny Clark cloned.  Dude.  Dude.  A bunch of chunky gray-haired Irishmen.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  What's up, dude?  Dude.  Hey, Bill Burr wanted to talk to your mom, by the way, Anthony.  Hey, why?  Because I was just wondering, like, such a classy lady, man. 
[02:01:00]  I don't know.  What happened to you?  You're like this gun-collecting redneck and shit.  But she looks like she could be at one of those Republican conventions.  I'm a gun-collecting psychopath.  I'm not really a redneck.  Like, I would shoot a redneck.  All right.  It was a hack reference.  I was running out of shit.  It's early.  You know, but I don't know what happened.  I guess I took after my dad.  You know?  Something like that.  Your mom is...  She's gorgeous.  Oh, thank you.  Pretty.  Pretty.  Gorgeous.  You know what I'm like to say?  You know what?  Your mama looks delicious, nigga. 
[02:01:30]  Sink, fucker.  Don't talk about her.  I'm not saying.  I'm just saying, you look older than your mom.  I mean...  And before you start complimenting her, she taught me every racist thing I know.  I love your mama.  All right.  I just like your mama.  Bobby's going to rub one out.  I love your mama.  You're going to rub one out to Anthony's mother.  No.  I didn't say that, Anthony.  Any time someone...  You know, your mother's really good looking.  That means later on...  She's horrible.  I didn't know it was your mom.  Don't rub your back. 
[02:02:00]  Come on.  Your mama's only 66, man.  Patrice, man.  You're getting Sal pissed off.  Disrespectful.  So you want to hear Twitchell's do New York, New York?  You know...  No, but okay.  Why not?  We're just killing time at this point.  This, a karaoke favorite.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie.  Boy, everybody gets involved.  Huh?  What are they doing with all those eggs?  I don't know what they're going to do with the eggs.  We got a lot of fat guys backstage that are really bummed out they can't do the egg-eating contest. 
[02:02:30]  Why don't we give them to the homeless?  Why don't we give them to the crowd?  Why don't we throw them at the crowd?  I broke my knee, dude.  This is how the brainstorming goes on this show.  Yeah.  We can...  What can we do to get fired?  That's pretty much how it starts.  Let's bring out Twitchell's once again.  All right, you twitching ass.  Every time he hits the stage, they yell, jump in. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, he should have sang them.  Should have sang Van Halen.  Getting his wireless mic together.  Or Pointer Sisters.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Twitchell's.  You familiar with this song?  Have you sang the song before?  Yeah, I sang New York, New York before.  Yes.  I love it.  I love Sinatra.  I love Crooney.  Crooney.  Yo!  Yes!  Once again, it's Twitchell's.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  I've never seen Twitchell's. 
[02:03:30]  In the heart of Times Square, it's Twitchell's doing New York, New York at the Hard Rock Cafe.  No better time or place.  Alienware.  Start spreading the news.  Whoa.  I'm leaving today.  He's a cooler.  I want to be a part of it.  New York, New York. 
[02:04:00]  Whoa.  Yeah, cute.  These vagabond shoes are longing to stray.  It's got tone to rest, also.  Right through the very heart of it.  Ah!  New York.  I want to wake up in a city that doesn't sleep.  Oh, he's selling it.  Now he's Liza Minnelli.  Can't find I'm A number one. 
[02:04:30]  Ah.  Top of the heap.  Can't you read?  Rah!  These little town blues.  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm melting away.  I've never seen so much back.  I'll make up a brand new side of it in old New York.  Wow.  Make it down. 
[02:05:00]  Look at this.  It's so falling down.  Ah.  He's asking.  It's up to you.  New York.  New York.  New York.  The coldest corn house. 
[02:05:30]  I thought he was getting electrocuted.  I really thought he was getting electrocuted, too.  What the hell was that?  How would you ever know?  A number one.  He's top of the list.  King of the hill.  A number one.  These little town blues.  Oh, this is horrid.  Ah, I'm melting away. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, this is horrid.  Ah.  I find a maze.  Oh, I do.  Start of it.  King of New York.  Boom.  Italy.  Everybody gets you.  Make it down.  Rah!  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's up to you, New York, New York. 
[02:06:30]  Look at them on the monitors.  Wow.  You rock.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Now he's ruining the crowd.  He shoved his hat up his ass and ran off stage. 
[02:07:00]  He destroyed one of our wireless microphones, by the way.  He turreted a microphone.  He had it in his hand.  He twitched so bad, the mic flew,  and wires ripped out of both sides of the receiver  and the microphone itself.  He destroyed it.  I think that's known as a death grip.  Yeah, he had the death grip on the microphone.  I really thought he was getting electrocuted like everyone else.  And then he started twitching so badly.  Yeah, we thought he was getting electrocuted.  Which would have been a great finish for the show.  Absolutely.  Twitching is getting electrocuted. 
[02:07:30]  We might have to do that.  All right.  We're running out of show.  Thank God.  Yes.  Quickly.  Thank God.  Quickly coming to the point where we can just drink  without the responsibility of having to do a show.  Right.  You having anything afterwards or what?  Absolutely, yes.  You got like what?  A 30 second of an Irish in you?  One 30 second?  That's about it.  You got to be a little Mick in you, right?  And a lot of Red Bull in me at this point.  Red Bull?  We also have Dr. Ian Smith backstage from Celebrity Fit Club. 
[02:08:00]  Supposedly Michael Strahan stopping by.  Did he stop by or not?  We don't know.  I have no idea who's back there.  Who's running this show at this point?  We don't even know.  We got Master Paul that wants to sing another song.  What?  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  Red Bull!  What are they saying?  Oh, Raining Stump. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, Raining Stump.  Look at the guy, look at the guy, look at the guy, he's asleep, let him fall, let him  fall, push him!  The guy who claims he's not drinking is asleep on his feet.  He's just tired, he's resting his eyes.  There we go.  He's resting his eyes!  He's resting his eyes?  Yeah, right on his mantis.  Have you ever seen a bigger collection of degenerates? 
[02:09:00]  This guy was sleeping, I was watching him standing, I was like, wow, this guy's an anomaly.  Yeah, but he's telling us he's not drinking or anything.  Dude, then you have some, what, neurological, you got narcolepsy or something?  What do you got?  You broke your neck, man!  You broke your neck and you smoked pot.  What?  I broke my neck in a road rage accident.  He's high.  A road rage accident.  I wish I was high.  In a road rage accident. 
[02:09:30]  Fucking token.  Listen.  You broke your neck.  In a road rage accident, they put two cadaver bones.  Very funny.  Two cadaver bones and a titanium plate in my neck.  You got AIDS.  So every now and then I just shut my eyes.  You got AIDS.  You got AIDS.  Holy shit.  You got AIDS.  You got AIDS.  You got AIDS.  And the ever popular You Got AIDS chant.  It's not a party until you hear the You Got AIDS chant.  You guys are animals. 
[02:10:00]  Dr. Ian Smith.  You assholes in this place.  So because you have the cadaver bones in you,  occasionally you just die on your feet and then come back too.  And the guy in the coffin twitches a little bit.  Hey, Ian, what's his target weight?  He needs to lose about 100 pounds.  Yeah, he should definitely be on the show, man.  What is he sucking?  What is that?  Yeah, what do you have in your mouth?  That's a medicated pop.  A what?  That's a medicated pop.  Oh, I heard about these marijuana lollipops. 
[02:10:30]  No, no, no.  Yes, you're fucked up on pot lollipop.  Pop?  Pot?  It's a pot lollipop.  No, no.  Joe Rogan eats them.  It's fentanyl.  No, it's fentanyl.  It's what?  It's fentanyl.  And what does that do to you, sir?  Makes you tired and fall asleep on your feet?  It's a painkiller.  It takes away the pain, but it does have some side effect.  You're drinking while you're taking it?  You want one?  You're drinking while you're taking it?  You want one?  The guy's drinking alcohol while he's taking painkillers.  He's not drinking alcohol, but now we know why he's passing out. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, now we know why he's passing out.  Is it lollipop form?  Yeah.  It's in a lollipop?  Yes.  Let me see what one looks like unwrapped and unsucked on.  You have a little wrapped?  Yeah, as opposed to that soggy stick in your mouth.  All right, we got to the bottom of what this guy's all about.  There it is.  It looks like a fucking tampon, dude.  You're sucking on tampons.  Let's see what this is.  It's only patients already. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, you know what?  All right.  Who cares about the lollipop drug thing?  We got this girl.  Get her on stage for a photo op.  Get her on stage.  Get her on stage.  We must control the radio show.  We might as well see the tapes at this point.  Jesus, those are fucking perfect.  All right, what's her name, E-Rock?  This is Map of Hawaii.  Oh, the Map of Hawaii couple.  Wow, here they are.  These guys, fuck, live on our show on Pal Talk.  What's up?  Nice to see you.  Wow.  Map of Hawaii once again.  How are you?  Wow, man.  It's so funny. 
[02:12:00]  How are you?  Here, give the lollipop back to the guys.  All right.  What are they going to do for us?  Let's get your lollipop.  What are they going to do for us now that they're on the stage, Anthony?  Well, I think everybody would love to see her loveliness.  Tits.  Yeah, watch the cameras go off in two places.  Oh, my God.  Make sure you turn this way.  Turn this way.  Turn this way.  Do a spin.  Do a spin.  Do a spin.  Do a spin.  Do a spin for the guys back here.  Yeah.  Yeah, like a spin.  Holy shit.  There you go.  What's up with that, huh? 
[02:12:30]  There you go.  Dr. Ian Smith, how many pounds do you think she needs to lose?  Hey, dude, let me see her on.  Zero.  Wow.  She's got her target.  Hey, dude.  Hey, guys.  Don't we want to see her cock?  Yeah, let's see your cock, dude.  Take your cock out.  Whoa.  Take your cock out, Ken.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, all right.  No, who wants to see a cock?  Is there any ladies out there that think they could beat that?  Just asking.  Get up here.  Right here.  I saw some tits right here.  Yeah, yeah, by the way.  Get up here.  Your tits are nice, too.

There you go.  Do a spin.  Do a spin.  Do a spin.  There you go.  Wow.  And those are real.  Yeah, that's XOXO.  Are they real?  Because I don't know if they're real.  Real.  They're real.  They're real.  Dr. Ian Smith, what do you think?  They're real.  Absolutely.  That's XOXO on Pal Talk all the time.  Very real.  Great.  Just as lovely in person as she is in a little postage stamp picture.  I didn't know Laverne from Laverne and Shirley was so sexy. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Did I see a baby girl in the audience, too?  It looked like she was there.  Well, yeah, now we're getting all the girls.  Oh, look at that.  Lucie's in there, too.  Lucie.  Lucie.  All the girls of Pal Talk.  Put your shirt down.  All the girls from Pal Talk.  Tracy.  Tracy.  Wow, look.  They're all here.  All the Pal Talk girls are here.

[02:14:00]  Wait, wait.  Turn.  There you go.  Turn.  Turn.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Bravissimo.  I've got to ask Anthony.  I love the girls of Pal Talk.  My body English suggests maybe a possible lawsuit later.  You think so?  Uncomfortable.  Anthony, good luck with that.  We've got a team of lawyers.  I've got to ask Dr. Ian Smith, calcium deficient on that last...  She is full of mammary lactose.  All right.  I need more protein.  He needs a protein shake. 
[02:14:30]  There you go.  Another girl flashing.  Turn.  Turn.  Very nice.  Looks painful.  Good guy.  Love it.  Is that Norton?  You're an Irish girl, right?  Yeah.  Irish girl.  Dude, she doesn't even know where she is.  You're an Irish girl, right?  You're asking her hard questions.  She looks like Thor's girlfriend.  Happy day, Packers, sir.  You too, white bitch.  You know what?  I want you to...  I would love you to...  Patrice, I want you to tell me to show your tits.  Show your tits. 
[02:15:00]  Show your tits, baby.  Say it mean.  Say it mean.  Come on, bitch.  You ain't running this movie.  Patrice, show her.  Hey, bitch.  Just pull out those uncooked eggs and show everybody, please.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There is something going on there, huh?  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.  Oh, boy.  I think a little jungle fever going on over there.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  And this is where we get shut down, everybody.  There you go.  As she tries to take her jeans off.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Yes. 
[02:15:30]  There you go.  Hey, there's no problem with that.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Are there moles on that, too?  Hey, Anthony, I think it might be time for the jokes.  Well, maybe not.  Oh, shit.  Maybe we should pass on the jokes.  Yeah, you're right.  Look at it.  Got the cameras out and the cell phones.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at Sleepy.  He's awake now.  There you go.  Give a big hand for the Aryan princes.  That's your people.  That's right.  Look at this.  She's got a Celtic thing on her back.  Yeah, there you go.

[02:16:30]  It's a joke, you jackass.  I like how you lobbied for that shit, Patrice.  Hey, let's ask Dr. Ian Smith what diet he suggests for-  Yeah.  Booty McBoo.  Yeah, from Pound Dog.  Let me see.  Yep, that's her.  Hey, what's up, baby?  What was that girl on Back to Life?  Was it Natalie?  At least wait until they walk off, man.  Jesus.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Raising your hand.  Her target weight loss.  Why would we want to see your tits, sir?  You are actually pushing.  You get up there.  You want to see my cock?

Yes, that's the-  Everyone loves Harry Potter.  The Harry Potter girl with the boobs.  Yeah, I've been there, done that.  You don't get off, doesn't it?  She looks like the girl that keepers, uh, not keepers, Donald Sutherland.  Ah, forget it.  Oh, yeah, that's sexy. 
[02:17:30]  All right, turn around.  Turn around to the judges.  Turn around to the judges.  Now, she's fat and in shape.  What do you suggest?  She's out of shape and in shape, Ian.  What do you suggest she'd do?  Yeah, let's ask Dr. Ian Smith for some advice here.  She's what we call a dichotomy.  Does she eat and do push-ups at the same time?  Yeah, right.  Harry Potter and the 32 Cs.  She's got that, like, schoolgirl, I'm a librarian's daughter kind of thing.  Yeah.  They're good, though, right? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  I think that was nice.  Absolutely.  Oh, they're chasing all at once.  They want a mass boobing.  They want a mass boobing?  A mass boobing.  Should we get a mass boobing going on or what?  It looks like a bad softball team.  I know.  Here they come.  All of them get up here.  And any other girls that haven't been up that want to join in.  All right.  Let's get up.  Come on up.  Look at this.  Bring up the bad news hoes.  These girls are... 
[02:18:30]  No, there she is.  She was the one in her underwear laying in bed yesterday.  We saw you in your underwear laying on your bed.  My God.  These girls are ridiculous.  This is better than the...  Jesus Christ.  Spin around for the judges.  One for the judges.  One for the judges.  Judges.  You've got to spin around for us.  You have to spin slowly.  Wait.  Slow.  Very nice.  She's going to pass out, but very nice.  She gave it real quick. 
[02:19:00]  She's like, no pictures.  Wait.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  Yesterday on Pal Talk, she just hung out in her bra and panties laying in bed during  the whole show.  Fantastic.  And there she goes.  Why did they suck their stomach in the back?  Wait a minute.  Don Knox has something to say.  Go ahead, Mr. Furley.  Tell Jack Tripper, that faggot, to get out the house.  Fuck the tinge, man.  Look at the twat.  He looks like an old Hulk Hogan. 
[02:19:30]  Old Hulk Hogan.  He's very disappointed.  He wants to see twat.  He's waiting for Neil Young.  He's waiting for Neil Young.  Not quite.  What do you want to see, Motorhead?  What's the problem, Lemmy?  I don't want to see tits.  That's a goddamn short.  Why not?  What's wrong with tits?  I see more than that at home.  Something tells me they're not out there.  No, but you don't got a woman who can take her left tits and throw her right side of  her shoulder. 
[02:20:00]  I do.  Wait, your chick...  Shouldn't you be somewhere building a motorcycle?  What's going on?  What's going on?  Your chick could take a left hit and put it over her right shoulder?  That's a trick I like to see.  Come on, sir.  Sir, what was Vietnam like?  Come on, Rosie.  Stop trying to tease the audience and pull them.  Jesus.  Pull those bag of potatoes out.  All right.  She's getting a good reaction.  And one for the judges.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Turn to the judges.  Ooh, that looks nice.  Look at those.  Oh, there you go.  Look at those. 
[02:20:30]  Look at those.  Wow.  All right.  Do a jumping jack.  She's eating too much carbohydrates, huh, Ian?  Ian, what's your professional assessment there?  Once you eat, Ian, you are what you eat, two boiled potatoes.  Man, take 50 pounds off, please.  I mean...  Her target weight is death.  If you are what you eat, I don't think the USDA recommends moose noses.  And kidding me, like, 400. 
[02:21:00]  Problem?  I think somebody got rejected.  They got sent home.  Wow.  She must have a record.  They don't have to flash if they don't want to.  That's all right.  It's only the girls who want to play.  We actually want girls to show up at our events.  I can't get over this guy looking like Hulk Hogan in 80 years.  Well, he's really pissed off.  He wants to see Quad, and he has a girl at home that can throw, what, her left boob over  her right shoulder?  That's from years of hanging on the back of a shaky Harley Davidson.  Sure can.  Just, like, tamped everything down at the bottom of his head. 
[02:21:30]  He looks like he's got an El Camino.  Sure can.  No.  Yeah.  He just keeps saying, sure can, no.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Hulk Hogan without steroids.  All right.  I think we're wrapping up the program, Anthony.  Anthony.  We've done it all today.  Oh, boy.  Next time a president gets assassinated, that's the guys they're going to blame it on.  I'm the patsy.  And, well, they should.  He's got a ponytail, too.  That's good.  You a biker?  Dude, you on a bike?  Of course I'm not. 
[02:22:00]  You on a bike?  Of course I'm not.  You on a Harley?  No, I can build them.  Oh.  All right.  Why don't we thank some people and get the hell out of here, Anthony?  First of all, we want to thank John at the Hard Rock Cafe for throwing this thing big.  If girls want to come on stage and flash as we do the thank yous, that would help us out.  As the credits roll, the girls can show this.  We also want to thank Don Wicklund for helping us out from XM Satellite Radio.  Marlon doing the karaoke from MercuryEntertainment.com.  Great job.

And if we didn't thank you, I'm sorry.  You guys, you guys are the best.  Thank you so much for listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  Cheers.  We're going to hang around and party a little more. 
[02:24:00]  It's our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  And thanks a lot, guys.  We're out of here.  We're out of here.
