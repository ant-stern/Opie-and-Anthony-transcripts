<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of comedian Bobby Lee's erratic appearance on Jeff Ross's show, focusing on a near-wardrobe malfunction.  This transitioned into a vulgar and derogatory critique of the *Honey Boo Boo* family and their lifestyle.  The hosts then offered their negative opinions on Sacha Baron Cohen's *The Dictator*, before launching into a sexually suggestive and vulgar discussion of the documentary about Dolores Hart, a former actress who became a nun, and the impact on her former fianc√©.

The show then shifted to somber news, covering the death of a fan, "Trucking Bozo," and a house fire that destroyed the home of comedian John Valby.  The hosts responded with crude jokes and speculation about the fire's cause, followed by playing some of Valby's comedy material.  This led into a highly critical and offensive discussion about welfare recipients in Georgia, particularly focusing on a news story detailing a temporary suspension of food stamp benefits due to a system error. The hosts expressed strong disapproval, using derogatory language and criticizing the recipients' perceived lack of responsibility and work ethic, debating the merits of work requirements for welfare in relation to recent Obama administration policy changes.  A caller, Ethan, challenged their claims regarding the Obama welfare policy.

The conversation then turned to the death of Neil Armstrong, punctuated by offensive jokes about him, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins.  A recording of President Nixon's conversation with the astronauts was played, followed by more crude commentary. The hosts briefly touched upon Maria Sharapova's planned guest appearance, the Dana White/Jon Jones controversy, Opie's encounter with Buzz Aldrin, and the relative computing power of the Apollo 11 guidance computer compared to modern smartphones.  A nostalgic discussion about a Gulf gas station Apollo 11 promotion concluded this segment with a fabricated, offensive joke about Neil Armstrong.

A significant portion of the show focused on the 2012 US Presidential election, gun control in the wake of recent shootings (including the Empire State Building shooting), and a debate, led by Jim Norton, about the taboo of criticizing religious beliefs in political campaigns.  The conversation included vulgar commentary about past presidents and a humorous, yet insensitive, reference to a Taliban beheading.  Graphic descriptions of the Empire State Building shooting, with humorous observations about bystanders, were included. Kim Kardashian's comments on gun control were ridiculed, and the hosts debated gun control laws, the Second Amendment, and the balance between individual rights and public safety.

The show later featured a segment on comedian Brian Regan's moon-walking material, followed by a discussion on one-upping stories at social gatherings.  A call from Colin Quinn complained about the rudeness of fellow comedians Roland and Jim Norton.  An impromptu eye exam for Roland, who appeared to have poor vision, followed. The cancellation of UFC 151 due to Jon Jones' refusal to fight Chael Sonnen was analyzed in detail, including a discussion of their fighting styles and personalities. Opie then discussed an upcoming performance with his band, Rotgut.

The final segments centered on Danny's search for a dog.  He detailed his criteria, frustrations, and the challenges of adopting an adult dog versus a puppy, discussing the pros and cons of rescue dogs versus purchasing from breeders.  Numerous callers offered breed suggestions, often repeating similar recommendations, which Danny rejected, emphasizing his need for help with the *process*, not breed selection.  The conversation included humorous tangents about dog feces, the difficulties of using Petfinder, and offensive jokes on various topics. Danny concluded by asking for help finding a dog, specifically requesting contacts for Vizsla rescues and providing his Twitter handle.

[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now.

[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  White simply, the greatest show in the show in the history of broadcasting.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  Every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the grub. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With O.P.  The destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Hello.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Dino's back.  I was kind of did Jeff Ross's show.  How was that?  It was fun, man.  And it was me and Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee.  I love Bobby Lee.  Is a funny fuck. 
[00:05:30]  I love Bobby Lee.  I don't know what to make of him.  Is it a work or is he really weird?  He showed up in a fucking hat and a weird mustache.  He looked like Mako from MASH.  The guy that would make all those appearances.  Yeah.  He's just a funny fucking...  Bobby Lee's one of the funniest guys ever.  I love him.  He's scared to do our show, I think.  He loves it.  No, he loves you guys.  He asked about us.  Yeah, he loves the show.  I don't know.  Is he really a complete psycho weirdo or is it part of his act? 
[00:06:00]  I'll put it to you this way.  He was good.  He was walking around a little weird.  And at the end, of course, the big closer for the night, I don't think it'll make the air,  was Bobby Lee's cock almost coming out again because he just pulled his pants down and the top of his shaft and his pews were showing and his ass.  He does love pulling out his dick.  He's a nervous Nelly man.  He's a fucking loser.  One of my favorite bits we did at the old studio was we had this console. 
[00:06:30]  This is how...  This is...  Here we go again.  The bitching starts.  But really quickly.  This just shows you how well XM was to us.  They even made the console rise up because we decided, we told Eric Logan, you know, some days we're going to want to stand and do our radio show.  And if you stand, everything is way too low to get at.  Yeah, yeah.  So he goes, all right, we'll make the whole console rise.  Yeah, you just press the button and the whole console list it up.  So we can make it kind of like a bar where you're just kind of leaning on the console and doing radio. 
[00:07:00]  And we decided to try that out with Bobby Lee and not tell him as we moved the thing up and down during his performance, his appearance.  And we all sat there making believe we didn't see what was going on.  And he was trying to get any of our attention, any one of our attention to go, you see this, right?  And none of us would fucking lead on that, you know, we were fucking with him.  He told the makeup girl, I was in makeup with him, and he's like, yeah, he was talking about our show. 
[00:07:30]  And he's like, and these guys always play mind games with me.  They always play mind games with me.  They always play mind games with me.  It was me, Bobby, and this girl from Little Miss Sunshine, Mary Ellen.  I can't say her last name.  Was she the girl?  I don't know.  I've never seen it.  The little kid?  I don't know.  How old was she?  She's a stand-up.  She's probably in her late 20s.  Maybe she's 30.  She might be the little girl.  No way.  That movie's been out for a while.  She's doing...  No, I think it was probably someone...  She was in that zombie movie, too.  Zombieland.  Really?  And then, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  I bet you that movie's 10 years old by now.  I bet you there's 10 years on that.  It's an edgy show, Jeff's show.  He did a Trayvon show.  Like, he's doing, like, fucking...  Oh, the Abigail Breslin's little girl.  Who did Mary Ellen something play?  I forget.  Mary Lynn.  Or Mary Lynn, I think her name was.  Who did Mary Lynn play?  She's a weird last name.  I'm trying to think, because the...  I don't remember the movie that much.  The movie was just, I think, the girl, and then the mother, who we've had on the show,  like...  Yeah, we did.  We were talking about Mary Lynn Raskub. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, Raskub.  Yeah, she was on 24.  Yeah, she was.  Yeah.  She's very nice.  She's very funny.  Who'd she play in that?  24?  No.  Little Miss Sunshine.  I didn't see the movie.  I just saw 24.  Oh, right.  With Keith Simon.  Was that the movie with Honey Boo Boo?  Oh, God.  I'm a huge fan of Honey Boo Boo.  Not even Honey Boo Boo.  That's trash.  I'm a huge fan of the mom.  The mom.  The mom rules.  She is the breakout star, they say, is the mom.  Is she going to call in?  Yeah, we're going to get her.  Yeah, we're going to get her a call-in with her? 
[00:09:00]  I can't believe, and TLC, they have to do it.  They show her age every time she talks.  She's only 32 years old, this woman.  Do you think they know she looks terrible for 32?  Holy fuck, yeah.  When they put her age up to her, I'm like, get what?  32.  This is what I know about her so far.  I think she's had at least three different fathers for her kids.  One of her kids, which are pregnant.  Right.  Her oldest is 17 and pregnant, but the mom had that kid when she was 15, obviously. 
[00:09:30]  That makes 32.  Then she has three other daughters, including Honey Boo Boo, and I think the two daughters  have the same father, so it's one, two, and then Honey Boo Boo's father, because it's  not Sugar Bear, I don't think.  Oh, I think he just split.  I think that father's gone.  And Sugar Bear just sits there and shoots tabacky and spits.  I don't even know what he does.  I was tweeting the fact that I think if black people watch that show, it's like when white  people watch First 48.  It's like, oh, really? 
[00:10:00]  Okay, this.  And then they just go, oh, shit, look at this white trash fucking family.  That's a fun family, because everyone tweets me like, oh, I can't wait for you guys to  make fun of this show.  I guess we will in a way, but that's a family that likes to have a good time.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of love in that family.  It's just a weird fucking setup.  Yeah, yeah.  They're not as bad as the pageant people, right?  No.  Not that bad, no.  No.  They get way worse, right?  But that pageant isn't going to be what Honey Boo Boo does. 
[00:10:30]  She's got a great personality.  Yeah, yeah.  She'll probably end up acting or something.  The kid is Honey Boo Boo, right?  Yeah.  The kid is fucking a mental patient.  She's got a big personality.  Big personality.  Yeah, I think she's a psycho.  What a name that is, Honey Boo Boo.  That's such a great name for a show.  But I mean, here comes Honey Boo Boo.  Yeah, no one's going to forget it, right?  That's what they were calling her during the pageant, because all it was was an appearance  on one of the pageants on Top Boys and Tiaras, and they spun it off.  And when I first heard it, I'm like, why are they spinning that off? 
[00:11:00]  Like, there's 20,000 of these fucking little pageant bitches that they could make a show  out of, but I guess they saw when they were filming, like, oh my God, we've got to get  this family on film.  We've got to get the mom.  Yeah.  Who loves couponing.  Yeah, yeah.  She's kind of a hoarder, too, right?  Yeah, she loves that couponing thing, that extreme couponing.  So she goes to the store and gets, like, hundreds of dollars in groceries for 20 bucks, because 
[00:11:30]  she knows how to work the coupons.  But that means you've got to get, like, 20 of every item.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do they eat healthy?  Oh, God.  It's all crap.  She weighs over 300 pounds, the mom.  The daughters that are, like, 16, 15, they already weigh 175.  I thought one daughter was the pregnant one, but it wasn't.  She's just fat.  She's just got a big gut on her.  And Honey Boo Boo's already got a gut.  Oh, she's fat.  She can't fit into her dress anymore.  The kid, they're setting her up for the pageant, and they're trying to put her in a dress. 
[00:12:00]  She's sitting back on the couch, and she grabs her belly and goes, I got a belly.  Right.  It's a great show.  I'm all in.  I'm all in with Honey Boo Boo.  But what were we talking about?  Oh, Little Miss Sunshine and Jeffrey Ross and Bobby Lee.  Okay.  Bobby Lee's on that new show.  I haven't seen it yet.  Animal Hospital.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, he's on that.  And he was in this movie that Anthony recommended to me that I rented over the weekend.  I'm getting a bad rap here.  Is it the same one I saw? 
[00:12:30]  Recommends.  I kind of hate you right now.  I didn't recommend it.  That was my Friday night watching The Dictator.  That movie sucked.  It did.  I'm agreeing with you.  And then I started, like, I put his name and The Dictator and Twitter to see.  And overall, people just fucking hated the movie.  Hated it.  That thing fucking blew.  What I said was, I was watching it and got a few laughs from it, a few of the scenes, but  I didn't even finish watching the fucking thing. 
[00:13:00]  I had to just walk away.  I didn't watch the movie.  I was getting, like, I was trying to hang in there, and I could get to the end of movies  easily.  55 minutes in, I'm like, I just, I gotta turn this off.  Stunk.  I started getting mad.  Yeah, you get mad at watching a movie.  I love that.  We get it.  You're making the tourists think you're terrorists in the helicopter.  Holy fuck!  There was a better way to do that, no? 
[00:13:30]  You didn't like that scene?  It was spoon-fed to you for 10 minutes before they started screaming.  All of his jokes were.  I only like his stuff that is unscripted.  I think he's a genius unscripted.  Like, he's the funniest guy ever.  Or, when he comes to him, like, the original Borat's and Ali G stuff.  I love Borat.  I love Ali G.  And Bruno on the show.  I've never seen Bruno.  I've heard mixed, uh, mixed things.  No, no, no.  Not the movie.  No, I know, I know.  He was in, uh, that's his-  On his show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I heard the movie, Bruno, uh-  I've heard the same.  Mixed reviews.  Mixed reviews on that.  But this dictator, holy fuck. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  There were just a couple of lines that he said that were really funny, but I thought the movie  stunk.  Like I said, if I was gonna recommend a movie, I think I would've watched the whole thing.  And I, uh, halfway, halfway through, I was just like, I stopped watching it.  It's funny, because we're kind of hanging out on the couch.  The kid is kind of chill.  So, I'm like, okay, Hunger Games or The Dictator?  Hunger Games or The Dictator, right?  Oh, no.  And then I remember what you said, and I go, you know what?  I haven't seen a good comedy in a while.  Well, you're not gonna see one turning that on either. 
[00:14:30]  So, instead of Hunger Games, which is an amazing movie, and I heard, you know, Jimmy said  he saw it recently.  I went with The Dictator and went, oh, my God.  Terrible.  And Anna Faris was terrific, because she's good in everything.  She's good in bad movies, because she just knows how to act.  But, fuck, Sacha Baron Cohen, go back to the drawing board, man.  Yeah.  Did that movie do well?  No.  It bombed in theaters and all that?  It bombed.  And the odd thing is, that I was, because I'm staying, because I'm doing my sleep study 
[00:15:00]  tonight, so I stayed up last night.  Hunger Games was fantastic.  You really liked it?  Loved it.  Really?  I can't wait to watch it.  I thought it was really interesting.  Very original.  And I, you know, Sutherland plays a real prick in it.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  But I liked it so much.  Did you see Hunger Games, Danny?  No, I didn't.  I can't believe how much I liked it.  Yeah, I'll watch it tonight.  I watched that, and a documentary called, I think, God is Bigger Than Elvis, or something 
[00:15:30]  like that.  And it's a documentary about, she was a hot starlet.  She co-starred with Elvis, Brando, Montgomery Clift, a bunch of these guys.  She was fucking smoking.  And in 1963, she entered a convent, and has been there ever since.  Still there.  She left Hollywood to become a nun.  What the hell happened to her that forced her into that life?  When you hear her explain it, it's just, she said it was a calling, and she had gone up 
[00:16:00]  to the convent to relax one time while she was in between movie shoots or whatever, and  she said something came over her there.  Something came over Elvis, all over her.  Yes.  Yes, maybe after she was on a fucking rotisserie with him and Brando.  Yes, exactly.  Where do you find these movies?  HBO, On Demand.  That's HBO, all right.  And there's a really...  Is it a good movie?  Well, it's a 30-minute documentary.  Oh, cool.  And she was engaged to be married. 
[00:16:30]  She was dating a guy for five years, and at the engagement party.  She tells him, I'm going, I have news for you.  I'm going into a convent.  And he goes, ha, ha, ha, that's a good one.  And then she goes...  Canceled the wedding.  And I don't want to blow the whole thing, but it was really good, man.  And I think she...  She was really hot.  She was beautiful.  Look up her name.  Her name is Mother Doris...  Doris Hart, I think, H-A-R-T, or Dolores Hart, Doris Hart.  I bet she had a giant muff. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  I bet it was giant.  It probably looked like Christ's beard.  That's what I'm ready to think of.  Her panties look like the Shroud of Turin.  Wow, yeah.  She, uh...  Yeah?  That's back in the day, they call it.  Yeah, she was pretty, man.  Well, fuck, I'm going to watch this.  Yeah.  Half-hour documentary, I could do that.  That's easy.  But Doris Hart, uh...  Just...  Is that her right there on the left?  Yeah, but no, that's not a good picture of her.  Actually, I could tell that's a good picture.  Take-out documentary.  It's not a bad picture of her. 
[00:17:30]  She looks pretty, yeah, you could tell.  I'm a big fan of eyes.  No.  Is that her?  Is that her name?  Wow.  Who's that beast?  There's an unfortunate tennis player named Doris Hart.  An unfortunate tennis player.  How about Google, uh...  You gotta find more images of her,  because I'm telling you,  there's some fucking smoking hot pictures of her.  Um...  Yeah, there she is.  Like, Elvis is kissing her.  Oh.  Yeah.  Like, how fucking cute is she, man?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  She was a really beautiful girl. 
[00:18:00]  What a looker.  She had sex with Elvis,  and that fucked her up, huh?  That fucked her up, yeah.  Well, she was...  And again, she was with somebody for five years,  so you know she was fucking him.  Oh, man.  But they showed a bunch of...  Wait, I know that face.  No, that's like Doris Day or something.  Oh, okay.  Fucking...  Who is that?  That's a very familiar face.  I don't think that's her.  That's her.  I don't know, is it?  That looked like...  She's 73 now.  She's been in the convent since 63.  How does she look now?  I mean, show a picture of her now.  She looks just like an old lady,  but she...  For 73, she doesn't look bad.  Like, when you look at her at 73, 
[00:18:30]  you're like, all right.  That's a tolerable...  Did she have an interesting life?  Look at her.  So far?  I see her, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, was it Dolores Hart?  Yeah.  Oh, Dolores.  That's my mother's name.  Second row to the left, that's her.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, you could tell.  But the eyes...  She looks all right for 73.  So she leaves...  Jota Rosa would do her.  I bet none smell.  I got her all bundled up.  She leaves this guy.  She leaves this guy.  He's in love with her.  He's an architect.  He's getting ready to build him  a new house. 
[00:19:00]  And they fucking show him  later in the documentary.  And he's still alive.  And he's being interviewed.  And you could tell he goes,  we were set to get married  and she had gone to this convent  and she got a letter.  And they said,  hey, you remember,  you said you wanted to come back.  And that's what brought her back.  They had sent a letter to her.  So he goes,  and she had out...  You could tell he's still bitter about it.  And they had outside forces interfered.  People found each other.  And he's like,  I've never gotten over her. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  And they show him going  up to the convent.  And now.  Wow.  And they're still close.  And he goes,  that's why I've been coming up  to the convent for 47 years.  What the fuck is wrong  with that guy?  Move on, you dummy.  He's still in love with his whole life.  But he never got married?  Never got married.  Oh my God.  He dated and stuff.  But it looks like he never got married.  He was so in love with her.  And this is what religion does.  Like,  she was in love with God.  And I guess it's a weird calling. 
[00:20:00]  But like,  this dumb woman,  like you had a guy here  that would have given you everything  who obviously was dedicated to you.  I don't know if she's dumb, Jimmy.  Oh, she's as dumb as I come.  Jesus will give her everything.  She might...  Anyone that is...  She might have a really happy life.  No, you know what?  We can't wrap our heads around it,  but she might just be  right where she wants to be.  Anybody that gives themselves  a life of celibacy  because they think God  doesn't want them  giving or getting dick  is nonsensical.  It's absolute idiocy.  Yeah, they should be allowed  to do both. 
[00:20:30]  Get dick and...  And have sex.  No, I mean,  get dick and be a nun or...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, priest or...  They should all be able to fuck.  Exactly.  It's absolute idiocy.  That's why Frank De Niro...  Frank De Niro...  Frank Manero  left the priesthood.  Right.  Who was that in...  Saturday Nightmare Fury.  Oh.  Tony Manero's brother.  Fuck, man.  I'm going to watch this tonight.  Yeah, I didn't mean  to give away the whole thing  until I started to give away  the ending.  I did, but I didn't care.  Well, I do.  I don't want to... 
[00:21:00]  It's a documentary.  Spoiler alert.  It's all a fact.  Sorry, folks.  I just got anxious.  I was enjoying talking about it.  That's very good.  I wouldn't even say sorry  because most people  didn't even know  about this movie, so...  That's what I'm saying.  You gave them a little hope  and then you fucking  crushed their dreams.  But it was really sad  when he goes,  that's why I've been  coming up here  for 47 years.  Do they still have  some kind of relationship  that's nice?  Oh, they're still close.  I mean, he still talks to her  and they pecked goodbye  and, you know,  he's just...  He loves her.  And he goes,  I still feel the same way  about her. 
[00:21:30]  What an asshole.  He is a douche.  Jesus, dude.  He probably had a small dick  and she probably told him once,  like,  what a big cocketh you have.  Cocketh?  Yeah, she probably said that.  Then she shuffled off  to Buffalo in the nunnery  and he's been jacking off  to her muff ever since.  Oh, it has to be.  He probably hates Christ.  You stole my chick.  Yes.  Jesus cock-blocked him.  You don't think  he's a God guy?  No.  Oh, he can't be.  How do you compete  with Christ?  Hey, I got my own firm here.  I'm building us a house.  Yeah.  He's the Messiah. 
[00:22:00]  All right, all right.  Outside Geneseo  is an abbey  where the monks are  and we would go there  every once in a while  and there's a section  for the public  and they could check out  the monks doing their thing  where they do  the whole silence thing  and all that.  Christ.  And I'll never forget  they had the guys  in the gray robes.  Those are the monks  and then they had a guy  that, I don't know,  he was in kind of  almost civilian clothes  sort of,  but in between  civilian clothes  and this gray thing  and the guy explained to us,  yeah, he's deciding 
[00:22:30]  if he wants to do this  for the rest of his life.  And I'm like,  oh, that's cool.  But then they gave  the backstory  he's married with kids  like he's ready  to give up all that  to become one of these monks  outside Geneseo  in this abbey.  And you figure the monks  would go,  stay with your wife and kids.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You shouldn't leave them.  I understand someone  that's lonely  and doesn't have  a family already,  but fuck,  this guy's giving up  all that.  And they're the type of monks,  they're not allowed to talk.  They don't talk.  That's stupid.  But they have one or two guys  that are allowed to talk  because they have to communicate  with the outside world 
[00:23:00]  and I always thought  that wasn't fair.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden  a guy in his gray robe,  hi, nice to meet you.  All right,  we'll give you the tour  of the abbey.  And then they bring you  into this hollow ground  where they pray  and all that shit  and the rest of them  aren't allowed to talk.  And all you hear  is their footsteps and stuff.  It's really creepy.  All those vows of silence.  If you're ever outside Geneseo,  it's so worth checking out.  I used to go on a retreat  to an abbey.  I used to go twice a year  on a sober retreat  with other sober people.  It was a men's retreat  and I would go every March  and every December 
[00:23:30]  for three days.  It was a weekend.  It was a Friday.  So I went,  twice a year  for the first nine years  of my sobriety.  I went to 18 consecutive.  Wow.  It was called  a Matt Talbot retreat.  And it was not aligned  with any group  or sober group.  It was just a bunch  of sober people  who were going on this thing.  And I went to many of them  with sober friends.  Oh.  And it was a ritual.  I would go.  I wouldn't work.  I would never take gigs.  And it was nice.  We would always stop  off at Stewart's  and have a hot dog.  It was like a weird 
[00:24:00]  little fucking fun ritual  but I loved it up there.  Gay sex?  No.  No, that's when  it was still pay phones  so I always thought  my girlfriends  were cheating on me.  So I would always  call back.  Yeah.  But it was run  by sober monks.  Something chill about it, right?  The monks that were sober,  they were all sober guys.  They make beer?  No.  They grew Christmas trees.  That's how they made  their money.  The one outside Geneseo  was all about the bread.  They had the best  raisin bread ever.  I forgot the name of it.  There's always something  that they make, right? 
[00:24:30]  This bread was ridiculous  how good it was.  People would come  just to buy the bread.  It better be  because that's their whole life  and if you could just  go get it in the store,  it's like they've got  to make good shit.  I know they're knickknacks  and shit.  Yeah.  They had an honor system.  They had this gift shop  because no one really talks.  It just kind of sat there  and then they had a box  so you buy shit  and you put your money in.  Oh, it's a dollar?  Right.  It's like 20 bucks  and you're like,  oh, can't talk.  I used to like going there  every once in a while  just to chill out.  Yeah.  And you'd watch these guys  just fucking in silence 
[00:25:00]  praying.  It was just a weird scene.  That is odd.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Fuck that.  I still have my little  Matt Talbot sweatshirt.  I love that sweatshirt.  Yeah, I found that recently.  I put it in storage  but I can't throw it out.  I see you wear it.  No, I don't want to show you.  Oh.  Because you'll sully it  with your drunkenness.  I certainly will.  I'll vomit on it.  How ironic.  Old drunk wine vomit.  I found a picture  of all those guys. 
[00:25:30]  It was a bunch of us  took a group photo.  I haven't seen so many  of them in many, many years.  It's weird.  You get older.  It beats dropping dead  when you're 30  but you realize  I haven't seen that guy  since I was 25.  Damn.  There was one guy  who was real loud  and his tongue  would always hang out  but I just knew  he was so happy  to be away from his wife  so he went on  like four retreats a year.  He just loved  getting away from his wife.  Yeah.  He would always laugh  like this.  Yeah.  He was a big fat dude  with mutton chops.  He was the greatest though. 
[00:26:00]  He was just so happy  to be around the guys.  Tongue is sticking out  when you laugh like that.  His tongue would just pop out.  Yeah.  I used to go.  He had like.  I don't like that at all.  You could not like him.  He was just telling funny trucks, truck driver stories.  He was really a nice guy.  Speaking of truckers, we lost the truck in Bozo.  Remember the truck in Bozo? 
[00:26:30]  He was a big supporter of our show.  Yeah.  Is that he died?  Yeah, he died.  He was on the truck show, right?  Yeah, he was.  How did it happen?  He, I don't know.  Natural or an abutment?  Well, the weird part is he left regular radio because he was sick and he was only in retirement for a little while and then he popped on XM.  Did we meet him or did we just.  He used to talk about us here and there, man.  He was a fan of what we did.  I believe we did put him on the air a couple of times back when we first started at XM. 
[00:27:00]  Do we know anybody from the trucking channel here?  There's somebody I've seen around that works for them.  I don't know.  I don't know who.  The trucking Bozo has passed.  Poor trucking Bozo.  I'm not sure if a lot of people know that.  That's why I wanted to mention it.  I didn't.  I did not know at all.  And then John Valby's house burned down over the way down.  Yeah, geez.  He's all right, though.  His family's okay.  For a while there, I was wondering if he was in there.  Yeah, that guy.  I didn't know him.  Trucking Bozo.  What did he die of?  Anyone know?  Looks like Michael McDonald.  Yeah.  Minute bomb, minute bomb, minute bomb. 
[00:27:30]  Poor Valby, man.  Your house burning down has got to be such a horrible thing because everything, your memories,  your fucking kids' drawings.  He's like 10 kids.  Valby is a...  If he does one thing, it's drink and fucking pump out potent loads.  Yeah, he lost everything in the house.  Oh, it's so awful.  It was completely done.  Do we have any news on that?  Estimating $500,000 he lost.  Yikes.  And all of his fucking notes.  I think that's just for that.  I think that's just the house. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, imagine like all of this.  His videotaped shows.  That was his house?  Is that after or before?  That looks after.  You sure?  It looks like one of those like...  Can we get him on the phone?  Let's try to get John Valby on.  I love John Valby.  That looks pretty burnt up.  Wait, we got the story here?  Sure.  Why not?  Commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the story out of Buffalo.  Oh, that's so sad.  He lived in Clarence.  Clarence?  Go local for the Buffalo people.  There you go.  And start your career today.  Right.  Good evening.  I'm Lou Raguse. 
[00:28:30]  Neighbors alerted News 4 to a major fire in Clarence this morning.  The home belongs to an entertainer.  News 4's Ed Dranch is live for you with the latest, Ed.  And Lou John Valby is known as Dr. Dirty.  He made it out safely.  The fire started around 9.30 this morning.  Tonight, he says, it looks like his house is a total loss.  Fleshing red lights and a smoky haze surrounded John Valby's Clarence home.  Early morning flames tore through the entertainer's house on Sawmill Road.  It's like an easily burned house.  I came out in the living room and you could see flames and then I saw the plate glass doors blow, explode. 
[00:29:00]  And so I got the hell out.  Valby ran from the house with his dog, his daughter and her friend not far behind.  It was she who first noticed the flames, screaming for everyone to get out.  The fire's destruction sparked heavy emotion.  Clarence Assistant Fire Chief Jeff Schlabach says the fire moved quickly, swallowing half the house before crews arrived. 
[00:29:30]  The fire had quite a good jump on us and there's extensive damage.  Half a million dollars worth.  Firefighters worked for more than two hours to control the flames.  The walls and ceiling collapsed in one part of the house, forcing firefighters out immediately.  We trained for things like this and, you know, it worked as best it could.  But this Sunday morning fire wasn't the first at Valby's house.  Earlier this week, he says trash cans outside the home were set on fire.  It's an odd coincidence.  If it were a script for NCIS, it wouldn't be coincidence, you know, but we can't think of any enemies. 
[00:30:00]  Despite Valby's raised suspicions and so much of his life destroyed, this fire has struck a different chord.  There's no point in dwelling on what you're losing.  You know, you can only go forward.  What's under the bridge is under the bridge.  We can use a nut like Gary Truman again.  Dang.  Poor John.  And I will say that that reporter's voice was making me physically ill. 
[00:30:30]  So annoying.  Smoke and a haze.  So annoying.  Gotta do your voice.  God almighty.  Can't you just talk like a person?  Guy lost his whole life and you still gotta do your voice.  Ah, I can't believe my house is on fire.  I can't believe.  All right.  Sorry.  I'm gonna do.  Believe me, I want to join in.  I know.  I just can't because I remember when I first met him and I wanted to do stand-up.  Great guy.  I was at Club Binet in New Jersey and he was one of my fucking idols. 
[00:31:00]  Valby's one of my idols when I was a kid.  Love him.  I love Valby.  So I walked up to him and I'm like, hey, I want to do comedy.  And he's like, just get together five minutes.  He was so nice to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I was so blown away that I was even talking to him.  Ah, burning down my house.  Watch out.  Fuck.  He looks good though.  Yeah, he does.  He looks good when he's not on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In his white suit.  Oh, man.  Fuck.  We love Valby.  All those memories.  I would love to get him on.  We don't have his number though. 
[00:31:30]  My roof.  My roof.  My roof is on fire.  Come on.  Ah.  Let me see it.  Oh, no.  We're bringing Smokey the Bear to the gangbang.  I'm not gonna do it.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  The fireman.  The fireman who?  The fireman that's here to put out the house because it's on fire.  I got Valby's number, but it is under home, so I know.  Oh, I didn't start the fire.  It was always burning. 
[00:32:00]  Ah.  I will not join in the revelry.  In the revelry.  I will not.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Burn, baby.  Burn.  My house is an inferno.  He saw his daughter crying.  I just thought it was fucking cute.  How could he do this?  Jesus.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[00:32:30]  Ah.  In my house is a burning ring of fire.  It burned down, down, down.  The flames got higher, and I ran, ran, ran.  I refuse.  I refuse to engage in this.  Of course you don't.  I'm sorry.  I refuse to join in the Merriman's.  Merriman's.  You're chomping at the bit, though.  I can see it in your face.  I actually am just too tired of thinking about anything. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, no.  I got his number, but like I said, it's under home.  Well, try him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  If you hear it ring, and then you hear somebody pick up and go, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  I'm sitting here and do it.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  I'll leave a message.  Oh.  Oh.  It's there.  We should have left him a message.  Oh, man. 
[00:33:30]  What?  Hi.  We heard your house burned down.  Well, yeah.  Just say, look, it's open.  We'd love you to call in.  Someone out there could get a hold of Albie.  We'd love to talk to him today.  Goodness gracious, my house is on fire.  Hello.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Same joke twice.  Yeah.  It made me laugh again.  I've seen fire.  Oh, it's my house. 
[00:34:00]  We'll not mention the Boyster Cult song.  Oh, my house is burning.  House is burning.  House is burning.  Oh, it's terrible.  I'm very sad.  Refuse to engage in this.  Yeah, I don't know that one too well. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know if Albie is nothing but the best.  He's got a great outlook on things.  He does.  You know, hopefully he doesn't have fucking shitty, what is that, progressive insurance.  Yeah.  Hopefully he's got good insurance.  Oh, progressive is good, right?  Yeah.  Hope Valby wasn't doing something stupid, though. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, man.  Knows to tip a few back.  Tip them back.  So 9.30 in the morning, he was probably just wrapping up from the night before.  Smoking in bed.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That house looked like a tinderbox, didn't it?  It sure did.  Old wood.  It looked like just a cabin in the woods.  Yeah.  I saw a sign.  It kind of had smoke on it.  It was like one of those signs outside the house.  It said, leaves and dumped...  What?  Leaves and dumped ashtrays.  There's only...  Like a little area. 
[00:35:30]  Oily rags here.  Oh, poor John.  I'm glad he's okay.  That would be awful.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll rebuild.  Yeah.  That's it.  You just got to hope...  You just got to hope, you know, too many really amazing things.  Maybe he didn't have them in the house.  Where would he have them?  Oh, my God.  No.  He lost everything.  Oh.  That's pretty obvious.  They even showed a burnt guitar.  That's terrible. 
[00:36:00]  Horrible.  Well, Armstrong died.  It's very sad.  Oh, man.  I would say it's sad because of who he is, but...  Well, he's 82.  He went into the hospital for some heart stuff and complications from the surgeries, I guess.  Took him out.  Yeah.  Three weeks later.  Yeah, at that age, I think people just, you know, leave it alone.  Whatever you got.  You figured you'd have good heart surgery.  Good thing.  Thank you.  What is that?  Is that mine? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, the food has arrived.  Maybe we can do the Neil Armstrong after the break.  We should because...  The food's nice and warm.  I got eggs today instead of my usual tuna, which could sit here for an hour.  But eggs, eh.  We'll talk about Neil Armstrong.  Cold cold, that's not good.  No.  Some food is...  A lot of food is good cold, but eggs is not one of them.  Eggs, not one of them.  Not good.  Not one of them.  Why don't we play some Valby?  I'm in.  Chicken, I'm in.  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah, let's play.  Do we have...  I love Valby's...  What they were playing on that was his version of All in the Family. 
[00:37:00]  That, and you don't mind my...  His fucking Edmund Fitzgerald parody makes me laugh every time.  Oh, yeah, that's a funny one.  Definitely.  I have both.  Which one do you want?  How about both in a row?  They're so short.  They're eight seconds each.  Back to back.  I think that's a great idea.  The one they call Itchy Woomy.  Itchy Woomy.  Itchy Woomy.  That guy's great.  Speaking of Valby, I remember that was the first time I'd ever met Bob Kelly because...  Oh, right.  That was the first time I think he was in the XM Studios was that same day that Valby was 
[00:37:30]  coming in.  And he was just downstairs and just assumed that I was working for the show or whatever.  And I just was like, who is this guy who's being really annoying and obnoxious?  Because he only introduced himself as Jimmy's friend.  Jimmy's friend, Bobby.  He's hardly even that.  Valby used to come in nice and early right from his gigs and just sleep until it was  time to go in the air.  Well, Bobby, he was running around the block because we couldn't find Valby because we needed 
[00:38:00]  his keyboards or whatever.  Well, we were trying to find the band.  Yeah, so me and Bob Kelly run around the block like idiots.  Lord Almighty, my living room temperature's rising.  Higher and higher.  I don't know which way to run.  Yeah, we also have the Steinway.  The hunk of burning house.  Right?  Well, the Steinway bit is classic.  Maybe we'll do that in the nine o'clock hour, but fucking Valby.  He had that shitty van.  Oh, yeah.  That he drove around with. 
[00:38:30]  What's his name?  Ron, right?  Ron wrote all the songs.  And Valby's the voice.  Yeah.  Pulls it all together.  The verse.  And I'm sure Valby wrote some stuff, too, but Ron was a genius coming up with a lot  of this stuff.  Yup.  And wanted to just be behind the scenes.  Man.  So, all right, we'll do some Valby and a break.  What the fuck is this shit?  We'll do some Neil Armstrong and some other stuff.  Stay there.  Stay there. 
[00:39:00]  Boy, the way the Beatles played. 
[00:39:30]  We all went on them panty rides.  Guys with long hair had it made.  Those were the days.  You didn't need to have a date.  Cause everybody'd masturbate.  Gee, my old left hand was great.  Those were the days.  And you knew who you were then. 
[00:40:00]  Girls were slots and men were men.  A mystery could use a man like Charlie Manson again.  Nixon had the Watergate blues.  The Boston Celtics would never lose.  Eighteen-year-olds could still buy booze.  Those were the days. 
[00:40:30]  And you knew who you were then.  Girls were slots and men were men.  Mister, we could use a disease like herpes simplex again.  Everybody had good drugs.  Howard Cosell, he wore bad rugs.  Nancy Reagan still had jugs. 
[00:41:00]  Those were the days.  Oh, yes, I remember as well.  So happy,Ë°Ä equals a date.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I'm Joelin.  I'm Joeas.  Please Organizate.  Thank you, everybody.  Me.  Good night.  I'm Joeas.  Good night. 
[00:41:30]  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, you know, we're fucking close enough to Canada to do this fucking tune.  I have a sip of fucking beer.  How the fuck are you guys doing, all right?  I just got off the fucking road, drove seven and a half fucking hours to get here. 
[00:42:00]  I know you guys don't give a fucking rant's ass.  I'm still going...  All right, yeah, Canadian song.  This is changing my attitude very quickly.  The Canuck girls came round from Chippewa on down.  There was a big one they call Ichiwumi.  Now, I didn't gripe that her twat looked like trite, 
[00:42:30]  but the smell of her feet really threw me.  The crew came on deck with their peckers erect,  going down on a hefty Hispanic.  I was second in line of a hundred and nine.  Less men went down on the Titanic.  Two laddies came in, she was doing her nails,  so she jerked them both off with her right foot. 
[00:43:00]  Her boyfriend had the hot, so he pumped twenty-nine shots  in the ass of that bad Gordon-like foot.  I cruised down the street, saw some faggots in the heat.  Edmund was hung of a barrel.  Jerry had two little holes in his butt.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald.  I just love the way Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God, it's better.  Two is in action.  Three is in action.  The opening of the show.  If you believe they put a man on the moon,  man on the moon.  If you believe there's nothing up there to sleep,  when nothing is going up. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just enjoying the song. 
[00:44:30]  Any R.E.M. fans?  Not so much, eh?  Yeah.  A little bit?  R.E.M., a few.  You know, the hits.  The hits.  Oh, yeah.  You can't go deep with R.E.M., right?  No.  What do we got?  Is Isaac's going to hit New Orleans?  Well, you know, with these hurricanes, no one ever knows shit.  At this point, I think we know.  It could be.  I think a cat won.  I don't know.  But then they're like, well, it could be.  I love the could be.  Is cat one not as bad, right? 
[00:45:00]  Meow.  That's sick.  Yeah.  I don't think New Orleans wants to deal with a fucking breeze at this point.  Yeah.  Well, it's heading right toward it.  Track a little west of Florida.  They were assuming that Tampa was going to have a problem with the Republican convention there.  Just heavy rain, man.  Tampa is inland.  Yeah.  Quite a ways, too.  So it went a little west, and now they're not quite sure where it's going to hit.  Somewhere between Alabama, fucking Louisiana. 
[00:45:30]  Louisiana, and it's looking like it's going to increase to a hurricane, maybe category one, maybe a week two, and then hit somewhere.  That's still pretty good.  They're reinforcing the levees.  We've got to hear about the levees again.  And it is, what, the seventh anniversary coming up?  Or we're around the seventh anniversary of Katrina?  Remember that?  Wow, that was fun.  I was there when that happened.  No, you weren't.  Well, you weren't.  You know how we're pretty on the ball? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  One of our biggest faux pas ever, and we should do a whole special on it someday.  Whoa.  When that fucking hurricane was hitting, we, as a show, certainly I will take blame for what I did, but I'm sure you guys were right there, too.  Oh, the stupid media hyping up this stupid hurricane.  Oh, we did.  It's going to be nothing.  Oh, yeah.  How many people did we get killed?  Oh, yeah.  Whoops.  I don't know.  It looked like the people that died weren't really our demo. 
[00:46:30]  Not our fan base.  Yeah.  Our batting average is really good, but we blew that one.  I would love to get the audio clip someday, because we're like, oh, this is, oh, look what they're doing.  They always do this.  There's a person.  There's a person.  Yeah.  That was seven years ago.  Is that seven years?  That was from that, huh?  Yeah.  There's a person.  Wow, that was from that.  It was 2005, man.  Fuck, man.  But I remember we blew that one big fucking time.  That's why Iraq got all those autographs for the Katrina auction.  Oh, shit.  Did we ever do anything with that? 
[00:47:00]  No.  I mean, maybe something, but, you know.  He's on vacation?  Why wouldn't he be here?  Well, he's on vacation.  That's good.  He's on vacation.  Sam's on a honeymoon.  Another honeymoon, by the way.  Where's Iraq on vacation?  I don't know.  Is that big fat someone up to New Hampshire?  I think he tweeted, hey, is there anything to do in New Hampshire?  Yeah.  How about fucking get on the radio, stupid, while the show is here?  Stupid asshole wants to go trek around with a moose.  Oh, well.  They like to stick to their own kind. 
[00:47:30]  For some reason, we have the worst vacation deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is strange.  I mean, there is no one here this week.  No.  I mean, we're going to take most of the week off, but.  We are taking some time, right?  Good.  Oh, yeah.  We'll take a few more days.  Excellent.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  I was just sitting there thinking about it last week, and I'm like, there's no, why wouldn't  I do this?  The last, like, you know, blast before Labor Day.  Yeah, I'm going to take some fucking time. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to relax around my house.  I hear the weather's supposed to be nice.  Why?  Because the company says we don't have the days.  That's why.  But then they did the right thing in the end and gave us a few extra.  We're going to.  So, I'm sure it'll cost us in some way down the road.  Nothing's for free around here.  You think the people will actually leave New Orleans this time when warned?  Do you think they'll get up and leave?  It wasn't as easy as that for a lot of people.  It certainly was.  Maybe they'll spell their signs right when they're spray painting.  The water is rising. 
[00:48:30]  Well, please.  Yeah, rising E on the end, usually.  Please.  Please.  Pleas.  Maybe someone erased the E.  I think someone erased the E.  Maybe he ran out of pain.  Maybe someone erased the E.  Nice penmanship.  Yeah, you can be forgiven for a misspelling when your neighbors and friends are floating by.  Yeah.  And you're on a roof waiting for your turn to be picked up by a helicopter.  Yeah.  That was horrible.  It was something.  Where were those people supposed to go, Ann?  I got a good opinion.  They're very, very poor.  They were supposed to leave before the fucking hurricane got there with all those days' advance notice that they got. 
[00:49:00]  Weren't there buses leaving town or something, too?  Yeah, there were buses.  There was plenty of opportunity to get the fuck out of there.  Very poor people.  Yeah, you know, I'm still tired of the poor people.  Sick people.  Sick of the poor people.  You're sick of the poor people?  Tired of them.  Oh, my God.  Ann's had enough.  Enough for the poor.  Attaboy.  Attaboy, yeah.  Ann's tired of this shit.  He ain't gonna take it.  Wow.  I fucking posted a clip on Twitter about some woman that, actually, there's a few people.  I guess some kind of welfare ran out in Georgia. 
[00:49:30]  And the, I called it the unapologetic entitlement that these people showed was fucking stunning.  It just, I couldn't believe it.  Should we play the clip?  Where are you?  Where's, when you gonna come through?  When you gonna come through?  I got six children to feed.  And they go hungry.  Really?  Really?  Six fucking kids?  You know, responsible families don't have six fucking kids?  Because they can't afford them?  And they know that in order to continue your wildlife style, not being on the till, that 
[00:50:00]  you gotta fucking, you know, you gotta work?  I do agree with you.  It's ridiculous.  You have to have some kind of responsibility as a parent and figure out how many kids you  can afford.  My keys.  Although, you know, my family didn't do that.  We had a shitload of kids with no money.  That's the one.  Check this out.  It's amazing.  And by the way, before you play it, they all have weaves and jewelry.  They got plenty of jewelry on. 
[00:50:30]  What's wrong with the weaves?  You know what?  If you can't fucking afford to feed your kids because the welfare didn't come through that  day, maybe you lay off the weave.  You fucking put a schmata on your head and buys the kids some food.  What's a schmata?  I don't know.  A babushka.  Is that one of those rag things?  Some kind of rag on your head.  The first one has a rag on her head.  But, um, it's just, it's so...  Why does this bother you?  Because it's so...  Why does this bother you?  And I was asked that.  I was asked, why does it bother me?  Do you have a beautiful compound?  You barely leave?  You're good. 
[00:51:00]  This is destroying our country.  It's destroying it from the inside.  This entitlement, this sense that it's expected to pay for people's kids is just a growing  problem.  And it's destroying the country.  This money and whatnot could be used for so much better, so many better things.  This total laziness and lack of ambition to do anything is costing the country jobs, technology,  everything.  But the country doesn't feel that way because they allow this, Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  Look, it ain't me allowing it.  That's for sure.  And when I go to the polls in November, I'm voting for people that don't allow it.  That's my fucking guide.  Why does the country allow this?  Because we have certain guilt-ridden people in politics, and liberal Democrats especially,  that feel that these people aren't lazy and just on the take, that they need it, that  these are people that fell through the cracks. 
[00:52:00]  They're ambitious people that want to work, but the jobs aren't out there.  Do you know what a small percentage of people that really is on the till, that really want  to work, but can't and have to begrudgingly take the welfare?  No.  This has become a way of life.  Their job is getting this welfare and fucking using that money instead of trying to get work.  This woman, bitches, she's out there for six hours standing on line for welfare. 
[00:52:30]  If you could fucking stand there for six hours, you could work, you bitch.  She could have sucked a lot of dick in those six hours.  Whatever you do.  Whatever you do.  I agree with that point, by the way.  Oh, it's terrible.  I do agree with you.  Hey, before you play this clip, there's a police officer in New Orleans.  We don't have to go to him, but he does say, Anthony, during Katrina, they didn't leave  because they didn't issue a mandatory evacuation.  Oh, okay.  How about woman-tory?  I think that's part of the problem.  There we go.  I think that was part of the problem.  Well, how about you just fucking...  I know when I go on vacation and every year there's hurricanes. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  The locals stay because they know the difference.  They know which hurricanes are really bad and which ones they could fucking ride out.  When you live in a soup bowl that's protected by a few granules of sand around it and a  hurricane's coming, maybe you shouldn't wait for mandatory evacuation.  Maybe you should know the dangers of the area you live in and get the fuck out of there.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's me.  I don't know.  I kind of think self-preservation.  You know what, though? 
[00:53:30]  I don't think you would leave.  Yeah?  I think you're a guy that would ride it out.  Well, you better do something with some sandbags and get to the high ground.  Let's say we got a Cat 3.  It hits Long Island, which is very rare, obviously.  Would you leave?  It would all depend on fucking where it's coming.  I would have to do enough of my own research.  There's an evacuation in your town.  Would you leave?  Yeah.  You would?  Yeah, I would.  I'd leave.  Really?  Yeah, I'd go to my apartment in the city.  People like, fuck you.  See, a lot of these people didn't have that option. 
[00:54:00]  Didn't the poor people have apartments in the city they could go to?  Come on.  They didn't have that option.  So a lot of them said, you know what?  We'll just ride this out and hope for the best.  Let's go to my apartment.  That's an ass.  I am an ass.  I know.  It's funny.  Let's watch this clip.  Yeah, let's see this wonderful clip.  So what is this clip again, Ed?  Well, apparently in Georgia, the county in Georgia, the welfare, they went to the welfare  place and for some reason there was a glitch and they didn't get their cards filled. 
[00:54:30]  They're little swipey credit cards to make it much easier and less embarrassing to use  food stamps.  They now have it like on a credit card.  Oh, really?  And frustration from dozens of Clayton County parents who say their children are going hungry  tonight after their food stamps were suddenly cut off.  Fox News.  Justin Gray is at the live desk with the story that is all new tonight on The Edge.  Oh, boy.  Justin.  Tom, state officials admit to me tonight that something went wrong down in Clayton County  at the office that administers food stamps and Medicaid, but they're still not sure what. 
[00:55:00]  Parents tell me tonight they can't buy food without those food stamps.  This food stamp card ain't got number 17 cents on it.  Terry Clark says she stood in line for more than six hours at Clayton County's Human Services.  All right, Ed.  What?  I'm annoyed.  I'm completely annoyed.  This guy got number 17 cents on it.  It's the attitude.  Oh, that's what I said.  It's the attitude.  You should be thankful.  They're not even thankful that they're getting free fucking money. 
[00:55:30]  They're pissed that it isn't there on time.  When someone gives me something for free, I'm very, very grateful.  Because it's expected.  This is their job, getting welfare money.  I was ready to pounce on you, but when you see that lady getting all fucking bent out of shape.  Well, let's see what she has to see.  Holy fuck.  They aren't getting free money.  That's right.  This is this liberal cocksucker.  Look, don't fucking.  Who is it?  Let me say. 
[00:56:00]  Where is it?  Where is it?  I swear I'm going to just fucking.  I don't know.  I can't find him.  Let's see what they have to say.  I didn't even hear the beginning of that.  I want to hear what she has to say.  Yeah, let's see what she has to say.  You don't have to go.  Yeah, okay.  It's just for her.  Because food stamp help for her six children unexpectedly ended.  There's no telling my kids that we can't eat.  I'm not taking no because my babies don't deserve that.  Nobody's kids should go hungry down here in Georgia.  State officials say this office was overwhelmed today.  Did you get that part?  With dozens of families.  Go back.  I want to hear her again.  I want to hear her again. 
[00:56:30]  Go way back.  You can't have six kids.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You can't have six kids if just a glitch in the system is going to make you go hungry.  Make them hungry.  You don't have any backup plan just in case?  None.  Sort of like a plan B or something?  None.  Plan B would entail some type of thinking and working.  One day.  Not in her fucking agenda.  Plan B would have helped not have six kids.  No, no, no.  Plan B.  I knew that was set up for somebody.  That's great.  But one day? 
[00:57:00]  One day.  And your family goes hungry?  That's kind of crazy.  My kids are hungry.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's go back here.  More than six hours at Clayton County's Human Services office because food stamp help  for her six children unexpectedly ended.  There's no telling my kids that we can't eat.  I'm not taking no because my babies don't deserve that.  Nobody's kids should go hungry down here in Georgia.  State officials say this office was overwhelmed today.  With dozens of families facing a similar problem.  The food stamp's just not there. 
[00:57:30]  Me and my kids, they haven't ate since this morning.  So, and I was supposed to get my food stamps yesterday night.  They haven't eaten since this morning.  They've been angry.  They started banging on the window.  They haven't ate since this morning.  They have not eaten.  But I didn't mind that lady.  No?  She was just trying to figure out what she's got to do.  I didn't mind the other.  What you do?  Fucking work.  I was bothered by the first lady.  The second lady, she's like, all right, I'm trying to figure out what's going on.  How about, how about you become a fucking member of, a productive member of society instead of a burden? 
[00:58:00]  You're a burden!  Jesus Christ!  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  A spokesperson tells me what happened here today was out of the ordinary and it was unexpected.  But they say they're not sure what exactly went wrong.  What was the glitch that led to this mess?  Our budgets have not increased.  State's election talk.  This director admitted to me there were problems here as he tried to calm fears. 
[00:58:30]  And his statement, a state spokesperson says, quote, we have both state and county staff working to understand the cause of the problem today.  We are working to ensure people receive their food stamps as soon as possible.  I'm a cancer patient.  I need these pills to survive.  Candace Bennett says her cancer medications have nearly run out.  And after spending all day here, her Medicaid and her food stamps are both still on hold.  When are y'all going to come through?  When are you going to come through?  When I'm on my last pill? 
[00:59:00]  Or better yet, when I'm dead?  And then I won't need it.  State officials say that Clayton County office was closed Monday because of furloughs.  And that could have contributed to the lines.  They are investigating whether some sort of paperwork or computer problem might have led to some families getting their benefits cut off by mistake.  Reporting at the live guest tonight, Justin Gray, Fox 5 News.  So they're going to figure that whole thing out.  They will.  You might just have to wait a day or two.  I don't blame the lady for wanting her cancer medicine, though. 
[00:59:30]  That's a fair thing to all.  There's a weird entitlement there, though.  I was so appreciative when I was growing up and we got stuff for free.  I was so appreciative.  It's expected.  They get mad that their fucking unlimited credit card isn't full?  They get mad?  And they're mad they have to wait around six hours?  Do you understand what this is?  It's free fucking money that people that work are giving you.  If you get free fucking money, you should be able to sit there for at least eight hours. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  Right.  The basic work day.  And feed your children's.  After eight hours, okay, maybe start getting a little annoyed.  But they're screaming that they have to wait around for six hours.  And every time there's a sit like there's been a lot of systems proposed, which like  work fair and things like that.  But people fight it like people.  Some people are for it.  But a lot of people object to it.  And the ACLU will jump in.  If you want to drug test people, which I think we should be able to.  Drug test them.  I think if we are providing fucking free money and all this stuff for people, I think it's 
[01:00:30]  fair for us to say you should be out looking for work and not doing drugs.  I think we're right to ask that.  I think I got a basic dumb question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.  So you get free money, so you get the welfare, you get the food stamps, right?  Sure.  Why can't you make those people, if they're able, do a little work?  Well.  Hold on, hold on.  For the town, the community.  Yeah, you're right.  Like, let's say, I don't know, you're maybe a couple hours a week. 
[01:01:00]  I'm not even talking about a nine to five, five days a week.  I'm talking, hey, man, you know.  What a great idea.  You're getting the free welfare and the free food stamps and all this.  What a great idea.  We need, let's say this, two hours a week from you.  You want an answer?  What is the real answer to that?  You want an answer?  Because I'm sure you know.  Obama just signed something a couple of weeks ago.  Just signed it.  That says you no longer have to work in any way, shape, or form if you're on welfare.  What, you used to have to?  You used to, yeah, there used to be a criteria where you at least had to look for work. 
[01:01:30]  There was part of the department where you had to show that you were looking.  And after a certain period of time, you had to show that you worked a little bit in order to continue.  He got rid of all that.  But not even looking for work, obviously these communities and neighborhoods are shitty.  So why wouldn't you tell the people, okay, look, you know, can you just mow this fucking lawn?  Let's take a half hour a week.  Obama president, eh.  Or let's clean up some of the garbage over here.  What's wrong with asking people to do that if you're capable of working, if you're getting free shit? 
[01:02:00]  You try to tell that woman you just saw in that clip that she's got to go out and pick up garbage in her fucking neighborhood.  For an hour a week.  She'd lose her fucking mind.  I ain't picking up no garbage.  What did Obama sign, though?  What did he sign?  He signed a bill that said you no longer have a work obligation.  That's ridiculous.  For welfare.  It's there.  I believe you.  I'm saying it's ridiculous.  I'm not talking about looking.  I'm talking about doing.  And why would it be bad to go, look, you don't want to you don't want to mow this lawn over here by the school that's looking a little shitty, you know, then we take away your welfare because you could obviously work. 
[01:02:30]  It's fucking amazing.  Then you would get some nice.  You would get some things done.  You think you would clean up some of these neighborhoods just a little bit.  There's an entire every person just does an hour a week, two hours a week.  That's nothing.  It's an entitlement issue.  We didn't have a lot going up.  If someone said to me, look, you're going to be able to have brand new fucking sneakers and some better food, but we want you to fucking mow a lawn here and there. 
[01:03:00]  I would do that in a second.  I think we were on food stamps at one point.  It's terrible.  My father got laid off.  Why isn't he still on?  You could just ride that out for your whole life.  Make it a career.  My family was on Opie's caddy money, which was terrific.  It was a great program.  Put it in a jar.  I lived that.  What are you, diabetic?  I lived that.  I was the one walking around the golf course for eight to ten hours a day, and that money went to the fucking family, man. 
[01:03:30]  Well, that infuriated me.  I saw a few other ones, but I didn't.  I thought I was going to pounce on you, but that is pretty bad.  Oh, it's just.  The one lady I didn't mind, she was like, all right, well, I'm just here to try to figure out what the fuck's going on.  But it was the other few in that clip.  It is this attitude and this whole mindset that that is now your career.  You're a career welfare recipient.  What's wrong with making those people work just a few hours?  I'm not talking 40-hour week.  Obama finds it a problem. 
[01:04:00]  And people, the second you suggest that, all kinds of people come out of the woodwork from the NAACP and the ACLU and say, no, this is terrible.  It's racist.  It's this.  It's that.  Not you.  But it's cleaning up your own community.  I'm not saying go fucking work on a highway somewhere.  It's just where you live.  Someone's in charge and goes, okay, we need this done over here.  We need a nice paint job on this fucking building over here.  When people aren't cleaning up their own community just to have a clean community, you're really not going to get much done by telling people that they have to do it for their welfare money. 
[01:04:30]  It's just not going to happen.  What did Obama sign down?  Do we have that?  That really annoys me.  Yeah, it's ending work for welfare.  I think it was down a little ways.  Why would he do that?  Ending work for welfare.  There it is.  This guy says if you make these people work in a county job, they will slip and fall to collect disability.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it's infuriating.  Yeah, work for welfare was the program, and he put a stop to that. 
[01:05:00]  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I was in a store, and there was a sign saying, Red Bull is now EDT approved.  Yeah, they're always mad if they can't get fucking beer with it or fucking cigarettes.  But then there's people that will use it to buy stuff, sell it, sell what they bought, and then buy fucking nails and hair and fucking booze with it.  We should have the right, again, if we are giving you that stuff, if it's our money, we should have the right to say what you get with it because we're providing food, medical care. 
[01:05:30]  I have no problem providing food or medical care.  I really don't.  And I'm not talking about turning people into slaves.  Right, of course not.  Just a little work.  Bare minimum.  Hour, two hours a week.  But, man, that would add up fast.  Y'all, I'm going to put you all back in chains.  You would get some projects done, man.  We're really reaching this doomed point where it just keeps happening.  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  I don't see this country producing.  It's so fucking sad.  Nope.  Neil Armstrong dies.  You look at the Apollo program fucking 40 years ago.  And what do we got?  We're going up an old 60s Russian Soyuz spacecraft now because we don't even have a fucking space program for taking our astronauts up to a space station.  And why is that?  Because all these fucking companies have just been fucked over.  There's no more technology.  Like, why would you stop something like that when that was one of the greatest generators of smart engineers? 
[01:06:30]  Do you think that they felt, like, with going to the moon, like, because don't forget, we just landed something on Mars.  Do you think that they felt...  With a lot of private money.  Like, do you think they felt like going to the moon and stuff, there was nothing really to be learned there anymore?  Like, almost sending machines you get more out of than sending people.  There's equity in sending people for even just a, I don't know, some type of fucking morale boost for the country. 
[01:07:00]  Well, what are you talking about?  The space station.  For, uh, yeah.  Now we have to, you know, hitch a ride on some archaic...  But we have a program, the space station.  There's no reason to, you know...  What's the International Space Station?  It's not just ours.  Oh, that's right.  We pretty much did the whole thing.  Yeah, we pretty much did the whole thing.  Right, right.  But then we have the International Space Station so we can be funded and continue to go there because we don't have a NASA program.  Yeah, we're great.  Yeah, we were proud of that, NASA.  All those fucking space...  All the missions that were put, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo missions, the shuttle missions, it made technology. 
[01:07:30]  That shit all trickled down to the private sector where everything you use today is based on something from the space program.  Tang!  And now...  Tang?  I loved Tang.  And now there's nothing.  I don't know if it's good anymore.  I have no idea.  Tang stinks.  They keep talking about...  They keep talking about how we need more thinkers and engineers and we got to do this and that.  How do you think you get them? 
[01:08:00]  Like, hands-on applications of people working with machines, trying to figure out problems, problem solving.  How do we get from this place to another planet and take everything we need with us or get there and farm what we need once you get there?  All that, there's no reason to think about it because no one's doing it.  It's sad.  Ethan says you're wrong about the Obama thing.  Yeah, I agree with Ethan.  Let me see what Ethan has to say.  And then we got Robert in Alabama that's got something to it on this.  Of course.  Hey, Ethan. Go ahead. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, guys. What's up?  Hi, Ethan.  The thing about the welfare, at least as I heard it on the news, is that basically Obama signed something that gives governors flexibility, like waivers, to do their own thing on welfare.  It's the same thing, actually, that Mitt Romney is for.  And so it has nothing to do...  And everybody who fax checks this, because it happens to have made its way into Republican political ads about Obama doing it, is actually all been deemed like the whatever, the four-star pants on fire kind of stuff. 
[01:09:00]  It's just about giving governors, most of whom are Republicans, flexibility to do what they want in terms of enforcing welfare requirements, some of which could be even increased work requirements.  Oh, really?  Why isn't there just a federal program like that?  Why isn't there...  Why would he stop a federal ruling?  I think it has to do with giving state governors more flexibility.  What's wrong with that, Ant?  All right.  Okay. 
[01:09:30]  I was saying...  I was trying to say that.  I don't...  I'll have to look further.  I don't believe him.  Well, this guy says it's pretty much, I think, the same thing.  Robert in Alabama.  Alabama, boom!  Robert.  Yeah, Ant, I'm pretty close to you politically, but yeah, I think he is right from the fact checks that I did.  It looks like when he signed it was actually to give more local governments, more state governments, more flexibility to impose their own programs.  As long as the end of the percentage returning to work remained as good as what was under the other program, then flexibility was allowed. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, so you get a liberal, democratic government like in New York State.  You think they're going to fucking boost up the work requirement?  But you're saying it has to be at least as good as it was, right?  Oh, sure.  That's easy to keep track of.  Which this really is the kind of thing that the state's right, that the Republicans, you know, under any other kind of administration would be saying that we really needed this. 
[01:10:30]  All right, then the governor's got to get on the ball then and start cutting these fucking people off, make them work.  But the real problem is we're at about 46% of the population right now is on some kind of entitlement.  At some point, we tip over that 50% mark, and then there's no way the person who's giving the entitlements is ever going to be voted out.  That party is then a permanent ruling party.  Right, because then they ‚Äì exactly, because why would you not ‚Äì why wouldn't you vote for the guy that's just giving you free money? 
[01:11:00]  Absolutely.  We're doing that.  So we're slowly fucking up this country.  Yes.  Do you like Noam Chomsky?  Yes.  Noam Chomsky.  I was watching some of his stuff, because ideologically, I just am so different than him, but he really is a smart dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was liking what he was saying about certain things.  Yeah, he's very interesting.  Look at him with his fucking ‚Äì his old guy hairdo.  Yeah.  But he's a very good talker. 
[01:11:30]  I was watching old debates with him and Buckley.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you must love them.  They hate us.  And they're just these two intellectual dullards.  They were really smart dudes, but they're just both fucking nerds.  Dullards.  Just nerds.  But really, they used to have these shows where these guys just sit across from each other and just bullshit about this stuff really intelligently.  Amazing.  Like, you know, Vietnam and all this stuff. 
[01:12:00]  People just don't like ‚Äì they clamor to see them.  There's one moment, and this is like in 69, where they were joking, and they were telling  you like a little joke about something, but Chomsky's like, well, I ‚Äì you know, I think  he was getting chided by ‚Äì what's ‚Äì who did I just say?  Buckley for losing his temper.  And Chomsky's like, well, I won't lose my temper here.  And he's like, well, that's good, because if you do, I'll smash you in the goddamn face.  It was pretty funny.  And he was kind of kidding, but you know he wasn't.  They got into it, man.  We got the Neil Armstrong, by the way, officially. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, Neil.  We were doing that, too, here during this break, so here's this.  Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, becoming a hero to generations, has died.  Good kid.  His family says he died following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures.  Armstrong commanded the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed on the moon July 20, 1969.  Oh, shit.  He then radioed back to Earth, where he stated his now famous line.  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. 
[01:13:00]  He and fellow astronaut Edwin Buzz Aldrin spent nearly three hours walking on the moon.  What about Michael Collins, bitch?  Fucking Michael Collins.  What about fucking Michael Collins on the side of the fucking moon, bitch?  Michael Collins is zipping around the moon alone while those two are frolicking.  He's jacking off up there.  Fuck them.  Space Jack.  Yeah, they had it easy, just hanging out on the moon, gallivanting, playing golf, futzing 
[01:13:30]  around, while Michael Collins had to fly behind the moon.  No one knew what was back there.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Monsters.  There could have just been fucking ship-eating monsters back there.  There could have just been a giant snakehead sticking out, eating spaceships.  No one knew.  Can you imagine he saw that, but he just knows he can't tell anyone.  Yeah, no one will believe him.  No one will believe him.  Yeah, if he looked down, he saw nightclub lights, but he's like, I can't, no one will  fucking buy this shit.  I know him.  And I don't have a camera, fuck. 
[01:14:00]  They have all the cameras.  He's the most isolated man in history.  It was Michael Collins, because when he was on the other side of the moon, he was cut  off from all communications, and there was no...  How fucked up is that?  Wrap your head around that.  Farther from any human being than a human has ever been.  Yeah, he was just...  But no one talks about Michael Collins.  No, they don't.  It's always Neil and Buzz.  So he's been further than anyone.  Even though they were the first two on the moon, without them, no one getting home.  Imagine if he just left them there, if he just said, ah, fuck them.  Oh, man.  That's what you get from being first, and then just hung a left. 
[01:14:30]  I'm going to hang a Louie.  Hang a left.  That's great.  What was the name of that fucking ship coming back?  Tranquility?  Tranquility?  Yeah, Aquarius, whatever it was.  You're off course.  Yeah, I'm coming home.  Well, Aquarius was the...  That was 13.  Or imagine he's passive-aggressive.  Eagle.  They have a fight, and he's like, no, I'm not picking you up until we solve this issue.  How about an apology?  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I bet you they've never been nicer to anybody than they were to Michael Collins.  Oh, yeah.  Right before he dropped them off.  See you soon, buddy.  Right?  Right?  We'll see you soon?  Dinner's on me.  That's just fucked up.  It really is amazing there.  And no one knew it, you know, that it was going to work.  That's just amazing.  They had a pretty good idea that it was going to work, but no dead guys on the moon.  You don't know for sure.  You know, that's weird.  I wish you would have messed this quote up.  It's one small step for man.  Which is surprising, because these boots are so dang heavy. 
[01:15:30]  In quotes, and on a plaque, so dang heavy.  That's weird.  One small step for man.  Although, it would probably be bigger if I had longer legs.  I've got webbed toes.  They have to put it on the plaque.  They have to put it on the plaque.  That's hilarious.  One small, oh, my bag is stuck to my leg.  Oh, my bag is stuck to my leg.  These words will echo through history.  One small step for a motherfucker.  One giant leap for a bunch of motherfuckers. 
[01:16:00]  Why is he talking like that?  Why is he cursing?  Walking on the moon, collecting samples, and conducting experiments.  Back on Earth, the former Navy fighter pilot never allowed himself to be caught up in the celebrity and glamour of the space program,  calling himself a White Sox, pocket protector, nerdy engineer.  Neil Armstrong was 82 years old.  So he was a true nerd, huh?  Yeah, total nerd, engineer guy.  Not much of a personality?  Figuring and calculating.  Because he didn't do many interviews, did he? 
[01:16:30]  No, he wasn't big on that shit.  He was just a nerd.  He loved figuring things out.  He was a very cool guy.  And he was a private person?  Yeah.  Because you didn't really hear about Neil Armstrong much.  You know why he didn't do interviews?  Because he had a weird nervous tick.  Yeah.  It was embarrassing.  They would ask him, what was the moon like?  He would say, we were on it with...  Down.  And we just...  Buzz and I felt that it was...  You know, Buzz and I were...  We weren't exactly sure what to expect, but we knew that the entire... 
[01:17:00]  Buzz always takes over.  That is embarrassing.  Yeah.  Buzz, why don't you take it?  That's why he said one small step...  He wanted to say something else.  Yeah, Tourette's.  They got pictures of the Apollo.  The Apollo 11 landing site, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, we talked about this a couple weeks ago.  They were able to get pictures of what?  That's pretty good.  The landing site.  The landing site.  The base of the lunar module. 
[01:17:30]  That's pretty fucking cool.  Everything's there.  Yeah.  That would be a pretty cool poster to have on the wall.  Man.  All that shit's just there for the taking.  Imagine what that would get if you brought it back.  Wow.  Wow.  But, you know, it's kind of hard.  You couldn't sell it.  You want to pawn it or sell it?  Why couldn't you sell it?  Yeah, this is a landing strut from the original Apollo 11 lunar module platform.  You know, not many people are collecting these things.  I'm going to have to, you know, get it restored.  It's going to sit in my shop for a long time. 
[01:18:00]  I'll give you a hundred bucks.  Well, you know, I had some Apollo 11 stuff and I sold it.  I feel pretty good.  I'm going to go out to dinner with my wife.  Every episode.  Do you know what would be great if another country, like the Chinese, sent up a ship and  I just took our shit.  No, but they just decided to land in the same spot and they video say to themselves, just  karate kicking the flag over and like kicking dust on all the footprints and like, and then  they dumped out and they dumped out like these plastic baggies of stuff. 
[01:18:30]  And they're like, uh, it appears that the Chinese are dumping duty on the, on the original  landing spot.  They've kicked over and now they are dumping bags and bags of duty on the spot.  If you were a powerful nation, why wouldn't you do that?  Yeah.  Just to be, just go up there and just fuck shit up.  That's your whole goal.  That would really, I don't think that would get a very good ovation.  Yeah.  And it'd be hilarious.  Doing like horrible shake their hiney dances at the camera. 
[01:19:00]  This ridiculous, just desecrating the place.  Pissing on it somehow without the dick freezing off.  Or they're just dumping tinkle, like blocks of tinkle.  Blocks.  They're throwing duty and blocks of tinkle all over the old landing site.  That would be hilarious.  Hey, uh, we got Nixon calling Neil Armstrong.  Hello.  And as far as technology goes, I just thought this was really strange because there's Nixon  on just an old school phone calling the moon. 
[01:19:30]  Do you need a battery?  Do you need a battery?  Well, your motherfucking batteries fell out.  Nah, those are new.  We officially don't have interns right now, right?  I don't think it works.  We're intern free for a little while.  I think I need a new one.  Yeah, you dropped the megaphone.  I know.  We got one?  No, I think it's just for a day.  Oh, for a day.  Nice.  Where's puppet hair?  Which one is puppet hair?  Sal.  Glorified intern, Sal.  Sal, right, right.  So here's Nixon talking to Neil Armstrong.  Hello. 
[01:20:00]  He's in his office now and would like to say a few words to you.  Over.  He's thinking about it.  Yeah.  I like his policies.  Could he call back?  I guess we got to do this.  Could he call back?  I'm dropping a deuce.  Right.  And it's really hard.  I have my hiney pressed up against the wall and a bag over my spine and my duty is floating  up into the bag.  Can you tell President Nixon I'll get with him in a second?  I'm shooting a deuce in the sky, as we like to say. 
[01:20:30]  Did Nixon get a lot of credit for this, even though it was pretty much Kennedy's vision?  I don't think so.  I think whatever president's in office at the time, you know, it gets kind of a little  rah-rah thing going, but nah.  Well, it was Lyndon Johnson, wasn't it?  LBJ was big.  LBJ set it in motion.  Kennedy kind of started the whole dream of the whole thing, and then LBJ's administration  got it going.  Then why do we always talk about Kennedy?  When it was LBJ that got it done, actually.  When it's Dickard, we will go to the moon and do those other things, like fuck Marilyn 
[01:21:00]  Monroe and Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  We will do all of these things, and I will lose my hat in November.  I'm going to wear a Stetson, and it's going to be shot off.  The top of my head blew off like the lunar module leaving the moon.  Governor Connolly will hold his hat miraculously.  That, we're going to go to the moon, and this blab-a-mouthed junkie is going to overdose. 
[01:21:30]  Bobby and I put her on the spit and spun her around while Joe served Mr. Coffee.  He's in his office now, and we'd like to say a few words to you.  Over.  Are you?  That would be an honor.  Oh.  All right.  Go ahead, Mr. President.  This is Houston out.  Hello, Neil and Buzz.  Hi. 
[01:22:00]  I'm talking to you by telephone from the over room at the White House, and this certainly  has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House.  How about ever?  I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done.  Hold on.  Hey, motherfucker, it's Michael.  Why don't you say hi to me, too?  I'm the motherfucker sipping around everywhere.  He just jumps in.  Collins just gets all upset.  Why the fuck are you here?  Neil, Buzz, Buzz, Neil.  I can't leave the motherfuckers. 
[01:22:30]  You think he's listening in on this going, what the fuck?  What about me?  I'm a piece of shit up here.  Jesus Christ.  You couldn't hear that?  What about chopped liver?  Can you listen to me?  I'm chopped liver.  What about chopped liver?  Fuck it.  I got to pick these fucking guys up.  What about me?  Yeah.  You hear Neil going, you know, yeah.  And Buzz and I, and in the back, and me.  Oh, yeah.  Right on me.  Say hi to the bus driver.  All are of what you have done. 
[01:23:00]  For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.  And for people all over the world, I am sure that they, too, join with Americans in recognition  of what you have done.  Feet, this is.  Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world.  Oh, boy.  And as you talk to us from the sea of tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to 
[01:23:30]  bring peace and tranquility to Earth.  By bombing Cambodia.  For one priceless month.  Oops.  Oops.  Take him two clicks up the Long River.  We did a better Nixon over.  If anyone does the Nixon, it's easy.  Yeah, we kind of didn't know what happened after this, huh?  Yes.  Huh, Mr. President?  Yeah, maybe checkers is going to go barking up there or something.  Ah, that's a good one. 
[01:24:00]  Not really.  Bye.  For one priceless moment.  Oh, boy.  In the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one.  Right.  One in their pride in what you have done.  And one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.  I think he's trying to come up with a soundbite.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like throwing a bunch of shit against the wall to see what sticks.  He's like, fuck, Neil just came up with something good.  I've got to come up with something just as good here. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, and he's not...  Rasping the heavens.  Right, right, right.  But he's not...  It's like, how about a convert?  He keeps just missing it.  The statement.  Thank God that you've zoomed up there in the clouds.  Oh, no, that's no good, huh?  In the heavens.  Try heavens.  Try heavens.  You've made all of us peoples feel goodly.  As a nation and as a planet, you rule.  We hope you're having fun zipping up around there on the moon 
[01:25:00]  while Jews and spokes ruin things down here for the rest of us.  It's my pleasure to know there are no Negroes up there right now.  The white man holds the high ground.  You aren't a Jew, are you?  What about Collins?  That sounds Jewish.  Don't let him land.  He'll try to claim it for himself like they did in Palestine.  Henry, Henry, these are your people.  Make sure the Jew doesn't land. 
[01:25:30]  You're a little more tricky.  And one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.  Night.  I heard you.  Oh, no.  Eh.  What was that?  I wasn't listening.  Thank you, Mr. President.  It's a great honor and not only the United States representing,  not only the United States, but  man of peace of all nations  and with interest and a curiosity. 
[01:26:00]  A lot of Iggers up.  Great.  Ooze.  What was that?  I like this boy.  And with interest and a curiosity and  with a vision for the future.  A  honor for us to be able to participate here today.  And thank you very much.  And I look forward. 
[01:26:30]  All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.  Look forward to that very much, sir.  Was this recording?  Was that Buzz at the end?  Yeah, I think Buzz was like,  Scott's got a few words in.  Because he's probably sitting there like,  can I say something?  I want to talk to Grandpa.  No, you heard in the back, you heard,  I'm not signing that.  Fucking Frankie asshole buzzes.  Buzz.  Neil must have asked him for an autograph. 
[01:27:00]  It's the only two up there.  No, get out of here.  Punch in the face.  I didn't write it.  I'm not signing it.  Fucking the president.  I don't want to sign it.  But it's for, you know,  it's for my kid, Ron.  I'm not signing it.  Buzz is cranky.  How could you be cranky  if you walked on the moon?  He probably was tired.  Wouldn't that take you through your days?  Your remaining days?  Wants to get home.  Yeah, he's probably had enough  of talking about that already.  So you walked on the moon.  Did I?  They said, yeah,  Neil Armstrong wasn't really  too cool about talking about it 
[01:27:30]  because it's how many times  could you answer  how was it to walk on the moon,  you know?  Yeah, I would have asked him  a better question.  Did you get a rod up there?  When you would get an erection,  would it slowly swell  or would it just doink out  and smash the front  of your spaceman costume?  Spaceman costume.  You ever have an itch  in your asshole in that outfit?  Quickly, Neil.  Comment.  Neil, comment, Neil.  Imagine if you had swamp ass  in that thing.  What was just the bottom  of your foot ish?  Is that why you guys  were jumping around like that?  That itchy foot, you think?  So, Neil, did you know  you look like a couple of retards 
[01:28:00]  bouncing around  in those stupid uniforms  waving like tards?  Fucking.  Has Buzz said anything  about the passing  of Neil Armstrong?  I haven't heard any Buzz comments.  He just tweeted, LOL.  Good.  I bet Buzz was pissed  he wasn't first  to walk out there.  But Neil was the cool,  he was the cool cucumber guy,  the unflappable guy,  and Buzz was more  the, you know,  emotional guy.  What did Neil do  with the rest of his life?  He just was an engineer.  Did he work after that? 
[01:28:30]  I think he did.  Didn't he work for NASA?  Yeah, but he was just  a figurehead.  They all get like a gig  for NASA.  They're like the real,  yeah, you fucking,  hey, there's the guy  that walked on the moon  right there.  Did he get a parking spot?  Working at a desk.  I'm sure he got like  a great parking spot.  He got the nice parking spot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was one of the biggest  VIPs in the world though  because like there's Popes,  but he was,  he was a teacher.  He taught engineering.  There you go.  He was almost bigger  than a head of state  because everywhere in the world  he's the first guy to do it.  Like figureheads come and go,  presidents come and go,  but there's not one person 
[01:29:00]  in power that wouldn't  want him at their table.  Yeah.  What about if somebody  finally goes to Mars?  First guy on Mars?  That will be amazing.  That's bigger.  The moon is bigger  because the first person  to land on another body.  Leave Earth.  Leave.  Mars would be bigger.  No, not the moon  I don't think.  Oh, I don't know.  You know what?  Mars.  Oh my God, Mars.  But the moon was a milestone  for people.  It's leaving the Earth  and going somewhere else  the first time.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Unfortunately.  I would love to see people  go back to the moon  just because we have  such great technology now  as far as imaging  and video and stuff.  How cool would that be?  It would look amazing.  Like, it would fucking  look amazing.  We got a lot of billionaires  that don't know  what to do with their money.  How about you do something?  They will eventually.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, they're trying  to privatize it,  but it's too...  You know what they did?  They were like,  all right,  let's privatize space.  Everybody get  your fucking money together,  build some kind  the spaceship-y thing  and have fun.  Oh, and now we're just  going to cut the space  program also.  Yeah, you need some 
[01:30:00]  overlap there.  You need to have them  get time to get up to speed.  So why would you cut  the space program  down to nothing  when people aren't  really ready to privatize you?  And what are they saying  about the storage  on our stupid smartphones  compared to the  Apollo 11 mission?  Oh, the lunar module.  But how much more powerful  are our...  I have to look it up.  I think a standard  pocket calculator  has more computing power  these days.  Isn't that amazing?  I heard the smartphone,  it was hundreds of times more.  It was nothing. 
[01:30:30]  It just, yeah,  there was nothing on that.  What did it calculate?  Peep-boop, peep-boop.  Peep-boop.  Peep-boop.  Fucking course direction.  Someone's asking  we play the Brian Regan  walking on the moon bit.  I don't know if I know that one.  Walking on the moon.  We walked on the moon.  On the moon.  We could play that  going into break.  Smartphones are like  hundreds of times  more powerful  than the computers  they use for Apollo 11.  That's crazy.  I remember  Gulf gas stations  had,  during the Apollo 11 mission,  had this little  cardboard thing 
[01:31:00]  and you'd pop out  the perforations  and you'd bend it  and insert  tab A  into slot A.  That famous shit.  And you built  a lunar module with it.  If you did it right.  Well, yeah,  and you had to get  a full tank of gas.  No, I think I did this  too.  It was kind of  a big thing.  But you had to get  a full tank of gas  to do it.  To get that.  And daddy wouldn't get  the full tank of gas.  Knowing his kid  wants to do this.  So I started crying  and asking,  you know,  that I wanted it. 
[01:31:30]  And he's like,  I don't need a goddamn  full tank of gas.  Why wouldn't he get  the full tank of gas?  He was probably broke.  He had quarters  from what he was stealing  from the vending machines  he was supposed to be  unloading.  And it's like,  I'll get a gallon  or two of gas  and I got some beer money.  Back then,  you could fucking,  you know,  you get a dollar's worth,  two dollars worth of gas  and you're good  for a couple of days.  It was Apollo 11 at?  Yeah.  I'm looking it up  on eBay.  Oh.  I wonder how much  that's worth.  I remember doing that.  Yeah.  I really do.  If you looked it up,  I can't find it  on my phone. 
[01:32:00]  Cardboard.  I think it was golf.  Wait.  The Apollo guidance  computer, by the way,  had 2K of RAM.  2K of RAM.  Is that good?  Is that good?  2 kilobytes of RAM?  Oh, for 1969,  I'm sure it was pretty sweet.  What do you get  for 2K on your smartphone?  What would that be?  I don't know.  A contact?  Is that about it?  Is that all it had  was to fit?  A contact.  Is that it,  you think?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  So wait,  what is this thing?  So wait,  it's right. 
[01:32:30]  Gas station,  Apollo 11.  Yeah,  gas station,  lunar module,  cardboard.  Gas station thing  for faggot kids.  Why don't we just  put a rover on the moon?  How's he going to do  radio from up there?  Why don't you just  put a rover on the moon  with some nice HD cameras?  Shut up the conspiracy guys.  I reckon.  Well,  you got all these guys  that have money  that they just want to burn.  Yeah.  That would be kind of  easy to do, right? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  I guess they figure  might as well use it  to go to Mars.  Oh, there it is.  Good damn it.  That's it.  See, that wasn't  easy to do.  120 bucks.  120 bucks.  It's 45 years old.  It was golf.  Wow.  You remembered it was golf.  That's crazy.  Yeah, that is crazy.  I do remember it.  How is that worth nothing?  Oh, man.  Look how complicated it is.  It all starts with one  tab A into slot B.  Yeah.  Oh, and it was cool.  And that one's  in perfect condition.  And it was cool  because the top  came off of the base,  you know?  It was like, 
[01:33:30]  it worked just like  the lunar module did.  Yeah.  We should buy one.  That was cool.  I don't have to buy one  and just break it  in front of Anthony.  No.  And just try it.  Just step on it  and kick it.  No.  See that one,  they didn't try to do it.  No.  No, you don't want it.  You want it.  There's a few of us.  See, look,  we almost got ripped off.  We could totally get  these for 25 bucks.  Oh, man.  Some asshole.  Aren't they all open?  No, that one's done  in perfect condition.  This one looks pretty good.  Look, 25 bucks.  Some asshole saved this  for 43 years  and it's only worth  25 bucks.  25 bucks.  You better have 
[01:34:00]  fucking a million of them.  He must be  Ben Golf.  That's his name.  He's got them all.  He is.  Well, just because  it's old doesn't mean  he's full stacks.  Yeah.  He gave a few  to Teddy Esso  many years ago.  Esso.  And then Larry Beep  Beepy came over.  Beepy.  Beepy.  Yeah.  And said,  hey, Mickey Exxon's  all right, Jim.  We got the joke.  How many more  am I going to name?  What did Armstrong do  for fun?  I want to know  more about the bat.  I don't know.  He collected  child pornography. 
[01:34:30]  One small hand  on my penis,  one giant load  on your shoe.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, he was  a terrible man  in real life.  Just awful.  Yeah, he's dead.  They check his computers.  Nothing but kid porn.  Nothing but kid porn  and fucking, 
[01:35:00]  they all had  little space helmets on.  He would dress them up  like little spacemen  and rape them.  Jesus.  All his spaceman  costumes had their  ass missing.  Yeah.  He'd just say  it was the oxygen line  he had to plug  into the suit.  And he had like  a little special  blanket that just  had like space  stuff on it.  So he would put  them on the bed  like, yeah,  you're bouncing  on the moon.  Yeah, look,  you're weightless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And here's the  little special chair.  It feels like a  finger in your bottom,  but it's really  a special moon chair.  Make it sit on 
[01:35:30]  his lap in the  centrifuge.  So he just  mushed into his  crotch.  Spin it faster  and faster  as he's grinding  down on his dick.  Yeah, we take him  into the simulator.  So that's what  he did.  Okay.  Yeah.  Now we know.  Very private man.  Yeah, let me show  you how the lunar  module is going to  dock with the  command module.  Here, pull your  pants down.  Here, first we  have to get it  wet with spin.  He's a great  American.  Great American. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I would just love  to know what he  had to deal with  where he wanted  to yell and  scream, I  fucking walked  on the moon.  He never really  wrote about that.  He couldn't get  some like rebates.  That's what I mean.  That's like at  rock bottom.  Yeah.  Just some  something where he's  waiting on line or  something and no one  is paying him any  attention.  He's like, I  fucking walked on  the moon.  Or how about some  dumb kids like he's  he's shuffling in a  store or something  like fucking old  man to move you 
[01:36:30]  fucking dick.  That's the weird  shit.  He's like, I  walked on the moon  and now I'm just  an asshole to these  kids.  No one walked on  the moon.  It was all fake.  That's when he  wants Buzz Aldrin  around to take care  of those fucking  fist.  I bet his wife was  so sick of hearing  about it.  He's probably all he  talked about like  white fucker.  He'd be like, you  ready for some  moon come?  Ready for some  I'm going to get  that's right.  Lick my moonies  when she was  she would lick his  balls.  He's like, juggle  the moonies,  juggle the moonies,  play with my module. 
[01:37:00]  She would like, I  ride with the moon  analogies and talk.  We heard you.  Top of my dick.  Let's go for  gimbal lock.  It was all space  talk.  Fuck.  I want to know.  I want to know  those weird little  fucking quirky  things.  Well, he was a  great American.  He was a hero.  Yes, he was.  Why aren't the  flags at half  masked?  You'd think,  right?  Why?  That seems like it  would be a no  brainer.  I would assume that  they would be.  Now, why aren't  they?  I don't know.  Why haven't we 
[01:37:30]  had a...  Who says whether  the flags are down?  Didn't we used to  have a day of  mourning and all  that shit for  some of this  stuff?  Back in the day.  Why aren't the  flags at  half?  I don't know.  You'd think you  would just do  that.  Wait for his  funeral.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  Wait for that.  Yeah.  He was a very...  He just kind of  lived a private  life after that.  We had Buzz  Aldrin in.  Yes, we did.  Fucking Buzz,  man.  I would love to  have met all  those guys together.  How cool is that?  That was pretty  goddamn cool.  I don't remember  what we talked  about to you.  The moon.  That was it?  I think we  talked about  the moon.  That was it? 
[01:38:00]  What else did  you talk to him  about?  We were scared  that he might  punch us.  I bought something  that he wrote  so he signed it.  I have it framed  in my house.  Oh, yeah.  I told you,  when I went to  that fucking  New Jersey  Hall of Fame  thing, me and  Voss were  inducting Abbott  and Costello.  Great.  And fucking Buzz  was helping  induct somebody.  So we're all  back in this  dressing room  and Buzz Aldrin's  there.  I had my picture  with him from  that day.  And so he's  walking by me  with his wife  and I'm just  standing there with  my girlfriend  at the time  and I'm like,  Buzz, can you  sign this picture 
[01:38:30]  of us?  He goes,  not now,  I'll do it  later,  I'll do it  later.  It was just  me and him  in the hallway.  He was such  a douchebag.  It's like you  fake a fucking  go to the moon  guy.  He punches you.  And then I  told you,  I've told this  my ex walks  over to me  later and she  goes, give me  the picture.  I'm like,  what?  She goes, give  it to me,  he'll sign  it.  And I'm like,  what do you mean?  She's like, he  wants to fuck  me.  So she walks  back over and  she's like,  she told me that  Buzz was like  flirting with her  and chatting.  And she's like,  oh yeah, my  boyfriend brought  a picture.  He goes, yeah,  I'll sign it.  And so she  went and brought  it back and he  goes, well,  I didn't mean  right now. 
[01:39:00]  And his wife  was getting  annoyed and she  goes, just sign  the picture,  Buzz.  So he actually  signed it really  nice.  And then she  slinked back over  and I put it  back in my  little fucking  sign the  fucking thing.  She's had it.  But then as  soon as that  happened, as  soon as that  happened, a  bunch of  people started  asking him  for cell phone  pictures.  Oh, no.  It really ruined  his night.  It did.  So they were  all on stage  together at the  very end, like  after Bon Jovi  performed.  And I'm on  there and Buzz  was there and  I'm trying to  talk to him and  he completely  ignored me. 
[01:39:30]  He was so  mad at him.  He was so...  When he realized  that the picture  was the same one  he had refused  to sign, I was  like, yeah,  something, something.  And he just  turned the other  way and pretended  he didn't hear  me.  That's cool.  That's fucking  great.  I love it.  Buzz.  Wanted nothing  to do with me.  Oh, he's cranky  that Buzz.  He couldn't  have wanted  less to do  with me.  Really?  We liked  meeting him  though.  That was a  fun day.  It's fucking  history right  there.  Not many  people get  to.  All right, we  got the  Brian Regan  bit going  in a break.  Hey.  It's kind  of old news,  but I think  it still matters.  The Dana White  thing. 
[01:40:00]  Yes, John  Jones.  The Shell  son.  He was  supposed to  be here  today.  Yeah, we  were supposed  to have  John Jones  on the  show today.  You're  right, Jimmy.  We teased  the fucking  audio for  three hours  and man,  we're people  annoyed and  look, we  don't have  our excuses.  We just  fucking ran  out of time.  So we do  have the  audio.  We could  go through  it.  Yeah, I  would love  to.  And I  also want  to talk  about the  Times Square  shooting.  I like  Sharapova.  She's supposed  to come in,  I think.  She's pretty  cute, man.  We said yes,  we'll see.  Who is she?  She's one of  the best tennis  players ever. 
[01:40:30]  Sharapova.  Very good.  One of the  best ever.  Make this  sexy dance  for you.  She's  supposed to  come in,  I guess.  Yeah.  Well, they  got the  U.S.  Open and  they're trying  to sell  tickets.  I think  we're going  to have  her and  maybe  Federer.  Maybe  Roger  Federer.  We said  yes, we'll  see what  happens.  I don't  know.  All right,  Brian Regan  to break.  I was  watching this  thing on  TV about  Pluto,  former  planet  Pluto,  got kicked  out.  Wow,  how embarrassing 
[01:41:00]  getting kicked  out of that  group.  How did  that go  down?  Pluto,  come on  in,  have a  seat.  It's the  hardest thing  I have to  do around  here,  Pluto.  I'm going  to cut  right to  the quick.  You're  no longer  a planet.  Well,  the best  we can  figure,  you're  just a 
[01:41:30]  big  nothing.  can I  still go  around the  sun?  Feel free.  What are  you?  I'm just  a big  nothing.  What a  horrible thing  to be told.  That was  decided by  the planet  definition  committee.  It's an  actual  committee.  They get  together and  well, 
[01:42:00]  you can  imagine the  wild times.  They wear  their colors,  tattoos,  born to  define.  What do they  do?  I guess there's a  guy with a  gavel.  Okay,  everybody,  focus.  I know  everyone's  excited.  A lot has  happened since  last time.  Daphne,  can you  read the  current  definition  of planet?  The  yellow one  is the  sun! 
[01:42:30]  I  appreciate  that input.  But we're  in the  middle of a  TV thing.  I  appreciate  that input.  I  appreciate  that input.  I  appreciate  that input.  So I'm  going to  back up  a second. 
[01:43:00]  Daphne,  can you  read the  current  definition  of planet?  I don't  know what  it is,  so I  can't do  her part.  Very  good.  Not sure  what I'm  making fun  of.  I don't  even know  what it  is.  Oh man,  I like  space  stuff,  man.  They  always say  we're  looking for  intelligent  life on  other planets.  That kills  me,  they have  that  qualifying  condition  on there. 
[01:43:30]  We're  looking for  intelligent  life.  Like finding  any life  anywhere  wouldn't freak  us out  totally.  we're  looking for  the more  intelligent  type.  It's like  we have  found  people  on  Neptune,  but  I don't  want to  be  insensitive,  but  it's like  we stepped  off the  lander  and then 
[01:44:00]  turn,  there's a  bunch of  we're  from  earth.  We're  looking for  intelligent  life.  Two  plus  two  is  chicken.  That's a  negative,  Houston.  good luck 
[01:44:30]  with your  hopes and  dreams.  Grab my  hand!  Grab my  hand!  We've  got  12 people  on the  moon.  Ever  since we've  done that,  you hear about  people who get  upset about  little things  in their  life and  they blame  the fact  that we've  been on  the moon  for their  problems.  As if  there's a  possible  tie-in,  you know?  Like if  their  phone  cord  is all  tangled  up,  they can  put a  man on 
[01:45:00]  the  moon.  But they  can't make  a damn  phone  cord that  won't  punch up.  They can  put a  man on  the  moon!  Maybe if  we never  did that,  they'd be  happy,  huh?  Isn't  that phone  cord  driving you  crazy?  Oh,  nah.  We haven't  even had a  man on  the moon  yet.  Why would  I let  something  like this  bother me? 
[01:45:30]  I think  life's a  bowl of  cherries.  Hey,  buddy,  welcome to  Antonio's.  Sit down.  What are you  looking for,  a simple  trim?  Straight  black hair  do not  rike.  Well,  we can't  do much  as far  as color.  I  bleach  brown hair  sometimes.  Okay,  you do that.  What is it  you want me  to do  for you?  Want  nice  big  hair  with  a lot  of  body?  Body?  Get  a  hairstyle  look  like  a  hot  stew. 
[01:46:00]  All right,  I can give it a try,  but I can't make no promises.  I get  tears for  fears.  The who's for what?  I get  a  frock  of  a  seagull.  What's that,  like a  fegler thing?  Do not rike  not attractive  to  female.  Whatever you say,  karate kid.  How about I take  some off the sides,  leave it long on the back?  Look  like a  Bay City  roller.  Yeah,  sure,  whatever you say.  So,  no ladies in your life?  When  try to get  American  girlfriend. 
[01:46:30]  So that's why you're here.  Well,  you gotta just keep trying out there,  buddy.  Hungry  like a wolf.  Yeah,  well,  there's a sandwich place  down the block.  Well,  there you go.  What do you think?  I  look  very  sexy.  Yeah,  right.  Great.  Look good.  glad you're satisfied.  All right,  food man shoe,  hit the bricks.  I  get on there  with a  skateboard  roundboard. 
[01:47:00]  He forgot his  fucking license.  Hey,  buddy,  you forgot.  Yikes.  That's not what I meant  when I said  a little off the top.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the  O.P.  Anthony Show.  How's everyone doing? 
[01:47:30]  Oh,  lovely.  Yeah.  I love early.  I have a question.  Yes,  Jim Norton.  Did we talk  about why  you cannot  mention people's  why is religion  such a sacred  thing  in campaigns? 
[01:48:00]  Now,  I know that we need  religious freedom,  but why  can you not  call someone's  religion into  question?  Why the fuck  is that so  off limits?  It's a choice  you make.  And like,  why can't you  be called  into question  if you believe  a man moved  to rock  after being dead  for three days  or if you  believe  whatever that  Mormon shit is?  I think it's  because you  have your own  beliefs that are  equally as silly  if you look at  them literally  and you don't  want to open  yourself up to that. 
[01:48:30]  But you know  what I'm saying?  Like,  that's the silliness  of it.  They call each  other out for  everything.  Didn't you once  say this word  instead of that word?  But yet this  basic thing  that dictates  your thinking  and your morality  and you believe  in like the  magical stuff  that happened  magic.  No one can go  wow,  you're an ass.  Yeah.  Because it's easy  to make fun  of the Mormons  but my God  the Catholic faith  is pretty crazy.  That's the one  I know pretty well.  Yeah.  All the idiocy. 
[01:49:00]  Idiocy.  My problem is  you know  the Jesus dinosaur  thing.  And we have a lot  of people that  still believe that.  Jesus sore.  Yes.  That's where my  line is.  Jesus sore.  Come on man.  Really?  That's really  what you believe?  That's one of the  senators.  There's people  in Washington  that truly believe  that.  Jesus.  A lot of them  too.  Riding the  velociraptor with  the saddle on.  That one's  hilarious.  You think  scientists just  when they get  together for a  few beers  just roll their  eyes like  they laugh  fucking dummies.  They have to.  They have to 
[01:49:30]  right?  They have to.  We got people  listening right now  that believe that.  I know though.  They call up  they get angry.  You know  they call up  and they  shut up.  Just shut up.  Yeah.  Who's going  to win this  thing?  Romney?  I think  Romney.  You've got  Obama?  What's going  to happen  there?  Obama seems  very vulnerable  let's say.  I've just  noticed like  a quick thing.  I was driving  around the other  day.  I'm on the  expressway going  quite a few  exits and I'm  just looking  around at the 
[01:50:00]  backs of cars.  Remember four  years ago the  unbelievable amount  of Obama  change bumper  stickers that were  on cars and  stuff?  I barely saw  any Obama  bumper stickers.  You see more  of those?  Not really a  not really a  scientific polling  method but it  just showed like  well people would  say they don't  like putting bumper  stickers on their  new cars.  Some of these  Obama fans and  believe me four  years ago I saw  a fuckload of  them.  Remember that's  what radio stations  started saying?  Well the bumper 
[01:50:30]  sticker.  That's why you  need a window  click.  I think that's  where that came  from.  People might not  want bumper stickers  on their cars.  On their brand new  cars.  So we got  window clings  that don't  resemble the  actual thing  anyway.  You fucking  asshole.  You gotta write  the book man.  That's a whole  chapter.  Yeah.  Window clings.  Wow window  clings.  A window cling.  I think Obama's  very vulnerable  right now.  I think a little  uptick in the  economy though and  it's a done deal.  He gets reelected 
[01:51:00]  in a couple  of months.  He just needs a  little uptick.  Good fucking  luck in a couple  of months.  I know.  He really is  coming across like  he's not doing  much of anything  and he's been  campaigning like  crazy to keep  the job but  without really  looking like he's  doing a good  job.  You know what I  mean?  Wow.  Wow.  Look at all that  red on the map.  Yeah.  But then do the  blue states are the  ones that like  there's some blues.  They got the big  fucker.  A lot of red.  Wow.  The middle of the  country just 
[01:51:30]  fucking hates  Obama.  Oh they are.  They are the  middle of the  country.  There wasn't one  blue.  No they are very  very Republican.  I've always known  that but when you  see it on a map  wow.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Yeah.  What is that about?  We just don't know  that part of the  country.  It's always been the  way with the  middle of the  country.  That's why we  should that's why  our next live  broadcast we should  just fucking dead  center of the  country somewhere.  Absolutely.  Let's see what  that's all about.  Yes.  As long as I don't  have a gig there  that weekend I'll  be happy to do 
[01:52:00]  this.  Exactly.  Do they pay?  No.  They said it  wasn't right.  They were going to  take care of that  one.  I'm glad I said  that but I  haven't heard  anything.  I know.  A lot of Obama  supporters think  it's going to be  another clean sweep  but they've goofed  so much on Romney  and with their  friends and watching  the news especially  and stuff like that  so they think that  that's the thinking  like oh man  Obama's got it  wrapped up  no one's going  to vote for  this retard  you know  because that's  how they speak  amongst themselves 
[01:52:30]  but if you look  outside that  and look at the  middle of the  country like  Obama's in  trouble in this  one.  I'm not saying  it's a slam dunk  either way  but to think  that it's impossible  that Romney can  win this is very  silly thinking  not that I want  the Democrats  running out to  the polls  stay home  it's fine  but I think  Romney's got a  real shot at  this  I think Romney's  going to win  because I think  a big part of  the appeal for  Obama was we  wanted a black  president  the first black  president  I mean it's  like I don't  I really do  not  it's people who 
[01:53:00]  cry racism about  Obama annoy me  because I never  think of him as  the black president  I literally just  get annoyed  24 hours a day  but it doesn't  even occur to me  it's literally I  get irritated at  the fact that I  like him but I  think he's a tax  and spend liberal  which annoys me  his race is  irrelevant to me  like I wanted a  black president  I thought that would  be a great step  forward but it's  like I don't give  a fuck at all  about that  when I get annoyed  with him I never  think of it and  like when he got  bin Laden I didn't  think of it 
[01:53:30]  he's up for the  same ridicule as  every other president  sure but the  second you do it  a lot of people  will say well you  just don't like him  because he's black  and you're racist  and you just don't  like a black  president all that  shit but yeah the  truth of the matter  is if it was a  white guy with the  same policies I  wouldn't like him  either believe me  but we'll see what  happens um I wish  they had a better  guy than Mitt  Romney yeah I  know he's such a  fucking wishy-washy  bucket of jizz  buddy-duddy no  personality whatsoever  bore he's just not a 
[01:54:00]  likeable guy he's a  smart guy but he's  not likeable even  bush had a personality  it was a little  strange but at first  it was weird with  but he had a  personality the same  I think Romney's  personality he was  hilarious he's funnier  than Obama and he was  funnier than than  fucking this stiff  Romney actually had a  sense of humor yeah he  really did but who's  the last stiff we had  in office like just  over-the-top  jimmy carter who  or george bush senior  bush senior was kind  of uh yeah he was 
[01:54:30]  kind of stiff because  you know I mean Obama  has the personality  uh bush we we have  discovered that yeah  it was funny hilarious  clinton clinton  had personality yeah  yeah definitely did  what a bush senior  reagan had the  personality yes hello  yeah bush senior or  carter nixon  nixon had a personality  oh yeah he was full of  personality  dwight eisenhower  romney just  yeah well you know you 
[01:55:00]  really don't know you  really don't get a good  feel of somebody's  personality until they  are president but i'm  with jimmy i mean that's  the best choice for the  republicans that's just  fucking weird i mean  they're such dumb ron  paul to me you know  the same shit happens  with the democrats yeah  but at least the the  lineup that we had to  choose terrible it was  unbelievable herman  kane newt gingrich they  threw that fat fuck out  again they i'm telling  you they purposely do it 
[01:55:30]  because they they know  who they want they want  romney so they yeah what  they have to do is stack  him against such fucking  garbage which they did  herman kane's a dummy  fucking newt gingrich is a  fat cunt santorum let's  not forget about him  santorum's a cunt um  ron paul i thought made  a lot of sense and i love  the fact that he won when  it comes to auditing the  fed but uh he's a rock  star he's just he's first  of all he's very old and  second of all he's just a  little too uh off the  beaten path for people and 
[01:56:00]  then they were never going  to push him and he had no  shot at the nomination yeah  so what they do is they  throw all this fucking dog  shit at us uh with the  exception of ron paul and  they make it look of course  i would look good next to  gingrich that fucking fat  whinging asshole what a  fucking fat whiner he made  it fun for a while oh he's  so hateable he made it fun  though i literally hope he  falls into an elevator shaft  and paralyzes himself what  about bachman oof i got  vibes from when i met her  really yeah she kept looking 
[01:56:30]  at it  uh that's a good question  people are asking are you  better off now than we were  four years ago it's the old  standard you know who do i  vote for feels the same to  me do a good job four years  ago are you better does it  feel the same to me just the  same i don't think so i i think  we're a much more polarized  what has changed your life in  four years um well i don't feel  as secure um as i did as far as 
[01:57:00]  uh what could happen with um  you know jobs and things like  that but that has nothing to  with obama yeah kind of our  industry is just dying why then  well you know what yeah then  why isn't it being you know why  aren't things being done to bring  it back  huh like like it's like oh that  has nothing to do with obama well  it's his administration his  administration it should have  something to do with it  uh that's that's i feel my life's  just the same really but we  wanted better  we needed better how about he  there's a lot of promises  yeah i think this i i what i'm 
[01:57:30]  trying to say is feeling just  the same is bad too we wanted  more we wanted a lot more no  matter who we are i think the  country has a much more for how  he got up there during the  inauguration oh shit that's  what i'm getting at talking  about how he's gonna elevate  this country oh it's gonna be  great and we seem more  depressed than ever as a nation  the people don't really seem to  have faith in anything because  there's a big letdown yeah and  as far as the country goes on the  whole people don't have faith in 
[01:58:00]  in a business in industry in  technology it's just this thing  like i hope i got a job tomorrow  i'll tell you why because with  obama even people who he had this  weird air around him like this  thing like he was an outsider  almost because he hasn't been in  politics long enough to be one of  these like fucking 30 year lying  ingrained pieces of shit but there  was something about him that  people felt he really does want 
[01:58:30]  transparency he really does want  this transparency that's the first  fucking casualty is presidency but  i mean i think that's what people  felt yeah i believe that he was  sincere when he said he wanted it i  don't at all i actually don't i do  believe i don't at all believe he  wanted transparency that  motherfucker clammed up the second  he stepped into that white house well  i think that again when you get the  gig there's things that you realize  that you can't like like he gave  mccrystal the fourth the 30,000  troop i respect the fact that he  did that instead of sticking with  well i said how long did it take 
[01:59:00]  well jesus christ he gotta have his  head beat in before he fucking uh  released the troops that the  general saying we need that was a  big one though yeah of course it was  but you know what yeah but i think  that when people see the fact that  he couldn't get these things done and  they believe that if anybody at  least in the political realm now  maybe ron paul's another guy that  can that can at least be a maverick or  somebody who feels like they're a  little outside the system and then he  goes in and he just spins his wheels  and you're like god there really is no  way like if a guy from outside came 
[01:59:30]  in or felt like outside came in and  shook things up a little you'd be like  all right even if you didn't like him  but it just feels like when you come  from that place and people feel good  about it or like wow this is different  and you spin like in a habit trail  people like what the fuck this just it  depresses everybody but i see him as  somebody that another president that  was a great campaigner great  campaigner lousy fucking president but  i mean uh you think the system set up  where it made it tough for him to get  anything done  because i believe that yeah yeah but 
[02:00:00]  why i believe that's part of the  problem i think uh from he's elected  we're going to see that same problem as  well  maybe not as much i don't know but i  think the system itself is fucked up  yeah but you hear a lot of people  say uh well you know the republicans  shut down uh obama uh they didn't want  anything passed and then the thing you  hear a lot also is um well you know  have you ever heard of somebody saying  that they hope he fails as president  you know that's not patriotic that's it's  like what the reason they were saying  they hope he fails as president is  because they think if he got to enact a 
[02:00:30]  lot of the stuff he wanted to that it  would be detrimental to the country so  the better of the two things is him  failing well romney is his mission well  romney's now promising a lot so now  let's say he gets in and uh you know  we don't see change again man this  country's gonna be fucking best it's  gonna be the same stuff like the problem  is when when a guy like that gets in  then the companies do what they want and  you see what scumbags they are this  it's like there's no answer it's very  frustrating because i like i don't hate 
[02:01:00]  obama at all and i didn't hate bush but  when i look back and i was for the war  and i was supported it we never should  have done it it was wrong and i was  wrong to support it you know look at  afghanistan they beheaded 17 fucking  people at a dance party the taliban  i'd have to do the same at some of these  fucking dance parties why would you do  that because they're just awful like  that's fucked up they were just dancing  it's a head chop off dance yeah amazing  finale it was a chicken dance i actually 
[02:01:30]  i stand corrected i apologize taliban  if you're if you're at that music event  how many beheadings would you sit through  before you're like yeah i gotta go man  this is too much for me they're doing the  hokey pokey and then if they thought  someone said uh you put your head in  oh it's not come on it's not it's all  right give yourself a chance uh what's  the story why why did they do this 
[02:02:00]  besides being savages that's it yeah it's  the taliban does not like parties and  music why would you take that chance we  all learned from footloose those people  should overthrow if they can't overthrow  this fucking taliban be careful huh that  would be funny if kevin bacon tried to  pull that move over there drinking his  jack i gotta go footloose headloose he's  all mad fucking hitting his little car in  the in the little warehouse they just  chase him around yeah he's doing back  flips and cartwheels and then they're 
[02:02:30]  just chasing him with big machetes like a  comedy and then at the end they all  dance together because they realize he  was right they dance and they're holding  his head  wow that's fucked up but you know we had  that this shooter in times square and a  lot of people stuck around to check it  out as it was going down right i wonder  how many beheadings would you'd sit  through yeah like yeah all right enough  let's yeah something else just what  lousy that do they are they're fucking  lousy people yeah they're simply 
[02:03:00]  lousy fucking people it's this archaic  thinking this primitive fucking thinking  how many let me ask you this in america  how many guys you think you could  recruit americans yeah to actually be  head people well that'd be a tough one  they'd have to be all lunatic fucking  crazy murderers in the first place the  answer would be not many no and you  you would know they were would be  completely crazy yeah but over there  seems like a lot of people could do  this they love lapping heads off of 
[02:03:30]  they don't they i'm doing for the show  for the show i'll cut someone's head off  if you want me to glaze uh yeah that's  that's crazy it's a religion that they  just they adhere to it and and they're  they're animals what what uh what band  was playing music event that's true  anyone good too shy shy hush hush i was  gonna say i would understand if it was  nickelback or something nickelback maybe  it's nickelback of course you're gonna  try to behead people they couldn't have 
[02:04:00]  found somebody in julia the taliban had  enough they were taunting the taliban  stupid nickelback avril uh levine is uh  engaged uh nickelback guy yeah huh that's  a little weird yeah wasn't she married  before or something yeah yeah she was  married to the uh that dude the shark  dude we met him once she must be a lead  singer some 41 yeah we drank with that  guy must be a cunt remember but we  drank with him too yeah yeah at that  weird v uh mtv music awards yeah we'll 
[02:04:30]  bust the rhymes okay yeah he hung out at  the bar oh fucking they all smelled like  weed yeah um it was just some kind of  music event yeah you know god knows what  it is over there it was a dance party it  was it was on uh it was in taliban  controlled land that's pretty stupid so  why would you dance around in taliban land  just all right dancing sucks to begin  with yeah fuck them now you're gonna let's  just pull out beheading you know what if 
[02:05:00]  the taliban lop all their fucking heads  off okay too bad rise up yourselves and  fight them right the awful imperialist west  get the fuck out get the fuck out of a rat  mind our business let them just keep  chopping heads off over there it's not  our business let's take care of the  problems at home first exactly how about  that guys uh sean in alabama knows uh who  is performing at the music event uh yes  sean i hope it was a talking head oh like  how he says it was the talking heads 
[02:05:30]  oh boy come on it's not bad oh i see what  happened uh-oh yeah no no no i get it now i  get it it was a mixed sex party so there  was men and women there oh well then fuck  them i mean if it was if it was dancing and  partying i don't know but now i know that  there was women there sure those creeps  they all like fucking bacha bozzy in that  fucking country a lot of boy fuckers boys a  lot of boy fucking over there mm-hmm they 
[02:06:00]  love their boys they just don't like  women huh oh no why would you want to  cover them up so much i just don't get  the weakness of those men yes the  weakness it is weakness right can't  handle  you know what you just remind me of  something i was down in uh where the  fuck uh wildwood diamond beach and one  of these couples set up on the beach  with kids oh no the woman was head to  toe covered on the i swear to you it was 
[02:06:30]  90 plus degrees how do they do it dying  under our dumb umbrellas in our dumb  bathing suits right do that and i forgot  about this we're all checking out for  like 20 minutes the guy is looking like a  regular american in a bathing you know  bathing suit no shirt on just enjoying the  beach and she's just sitting there  struggling he's in a beach chair i swear  to you she's sitting on a on a towel a  blanket you know how uncomfortable that  gets after like two minutes she knows 
[02:07:00]  our place and then she had to put the  lotion on the guy we're watching this  whole thing go down and people all  around this couple and they had a couple  of small kids were just beyond outraged  like how would you deal with this well  it's amazing it's not and but you're  supposed to respect other cultures oh yeah  no one said it was like no but you  should look at them and go do you know  how fucking ridiculous you look at the  beach in that outfit the guy dumb the  guy i mean and you know it could be  many religions so i'm just gonna say it  he looked like a complete asshole to 
[02:07:30]  allow this and how do people tolerate  that as far as women's rights go and and  how uh women are treated i didn't see  how do they tolerate that she wasn't in  she wasn't in black she sort of had part  of her face uh uncovered but the guy oh  the guy had just her bathing suit that's  it and she she had to be dying in this  thing yeah and she had to sit on the  fucking uh blanket next to him as he's  in a really nice beach chair just hanging  out if a guy was on the towel let's see 
[02:08:00]  that to me is more detrimental than  smacking a woman in the face man because  if a guy was on the beach and he just  smacked his chick in the face people  would come over and be outraged right you  motherfucker they would unload on but  dressing her up like that on the beach  is worse than that i think wait a minute  i'm sorry she's in the ocean with one  they have gloves on too i don't know  this woman does have a glove on i don't  know why but so you can't see her skin  people look they're disgusting now look  okay you can't really question it because 
[02:08:30]  it's part of his religion i guess but  this is what this is my question you  know it's a really hot day you know this  is how you guys do things why would you  take her to the beach because he wants  to go because there's self-serving wants  to go awful and she had to sit behind  him i noticed too because he had the  prime prime uh chair he was looking at  the ocean he had a nice little  refreshing drink and she was  uncomfortable on the blanket behind him  i'm sick of fucking women bitching about  like like their rights and stuff when  shit like this goes on and and no one 
[02:09:00]  says anything fuck you yeah fuck up  fuck everyone what am i saying but  cares but we all i mean you know just  complete strangers you're you're making  eye contact with complete strangers  going yeah look at this yeah that's  shit that's funny  i don't know hey uh times square turns  out the cops uh  state building oh i'm sorry yeah time 
[02:09:30]  square was the last one i know god that  was the other guy with the knife you  know kidding that was very recent too yeah  yeah this guy with the empire state  building um it's not it wasn't a mass  shooting that the guy did it wasn't  like he wanted to go to the empire  stable and he shoot people up he had  his target one guy his boss of his right  he was disgruntled right he wanted to  go up and and did exactly what he  wanted to shot him and started walking  away and apparently a construction  worker saw him and told the cops hey  that guy just shot somebody right and  the cops went to approach him he spun 
[02:10:00]  around uh pulled his gun out on the  cops cops unload on him killing him but in  the uh in the meantime they also uh shot  nine people that were in the area  either by uh two of them got shot with  genuine bullets right and the rest got  ricochets and fragments um but uh yeah  all the injuries were done by the police  department you think bloomberg's like  oh boy bloomberg's a big gun guy anti-gun 
[02:10:30]  guy yeah but you know what you can't  yeah here it is here's the video the  surveillance surveillance video here's a  guy comes around the planter two cops  now he pulls the gun one cop goes to  take cover the other cops one arming it  there's the head shot that's the head  shot good shot right there to all the  people that complain about big brother  and the cameras this is the beauty of  having cameras everywhere look at this  all right yeah he walks around he's  like he's working sort of in the street 
[02:11:00]  between the planter hey you and he pulled  his gun on him now that guy's trying  some cover and concealment now i i gotta  go back and show you something that you  didn't notice yeah we have another  situation of a a grown adult leaving  their child oh right a pause where  where get ready to pause  ah i see it oh the woman in white yes  she runs off she lets goes her little 
[02:11:30]  daughter is fucking just i think they  were holding hands even a lot of people  think it the the woman in the black was  the mom because she runs the complete  opposite direction no if you see the  surveillance footage you'll see a mom and  a daughter and the mom just takes a  one turn and takes off she totally  christian is that bitch oh my god  watch the move she makes fuck that and  there's the kids still walking like hey  mom where you going you see that she  abandoned but then again you know it's 
[02:12:00]  easy to say what the fuck but i don't  know what you're gonna do who knows  what what the fuck happens in your  brain i love this fat guy gets shot like  three times i love the fat lady who  runs in the foreground in the black  yeah fucking big fat monster head  yeah she hasn't exercised in decades but  she knows when or wrong when she has  a big purse look at look at fatty wait  till she comes back watch this move  she make big panicking elephant look at  a stampeding  her hair is why are we laughing at this  this is great  haha look at the people run for their 
[02:12:30]  lives  fucking horrific now obviously you can't  say what you would do what anybody  should do no one could second guess  these guys but if you look at the tape  what you just see on the just looking  in not knowing anything else right one of  the cops the second the guy pulls the  gun out he gets behind the planter two  hand grip on his gun and start shooting  and using the planter in between him  and the gun the gunman look he's over  now now the gunman moves out a little  he moves closer to the planter right the  other cop steps into the middle of the 
[02:13:00]  sidewalk he's one handing it he's  fucking manix he's got the one hand out  and he's shooting wildly  um real weird ridiculous why why the  fuck yeah i don't know he's like  strafing and trying to fire yeah he's  there's not a lot of there's not a lot  of outrage over the fact that no because  people no one died and uh they dispatched  the problem uh but yeah this is but this 
[02:13:30]  is going to be a training video can you go  frame by frame with the mom i want to see  when she bails are they holding hands  let me see well they're no no but they're  right next to you that's obviously her  kid it's obviously her kid and then  watch the right turn actually she cuts  her kid off she runs right in front of  the kid to watch and at this point she  realizes that there's a yeah she's got  her foot dug in she's ready to steal  second and the bad part is the kid  doesn't know any better so the kid  turned her head to the left to look look 
[02:14:00]  and the mom's like you don't look now  you can see right there though he's  still holding his stetson now if you go  two more frames in by then he is he's  dropped his hat he's obviously turning  back and he's looking towards the  knoll look at that guy why didn't that  guy get off his bench yeah that guy's  just reading look i just want to see the  sea lion run back again i love how look  at her head her head is if anything  should have taken a bullet it's this  lady's head and she's got her hands on  her head she she immediately broke down 
[02:14:30]  she's panic mode she's panicking it's  easy to look on and laugh but fuck  fuck that that bench was a bad place  because that's right behind the guy you  just never know word word you probably  felt lucky that you got a seat on the  bench yeah there's something to be said  for Darwinism you know and that that  lady she just sometimes you know she's  got to be the gazelle for the lion  sometimes you know they got to eat  lions got to eat lion got ego let's see  what uh she is pat she's fallen all 
[02:15:00]  over herself wow god i fell down dead  that's great because he does you can  see him get shot twice before he falls  he does like this little move then he  drops his bag and then he just topples  over dead and a lot of people like why  do they have to cough him supposedly he  was still alive after they shot him for  he was moving a little bit that's  gonna suck with bullets they need to get  cuffed yeah ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow my  bones out and all you want to do is use  your hands to hold your head because it  aches oh man god she knew how to run 
[02:15:30]  huh we should definitely ban some guns  yes exactly from the police oh wait  maybe not we both uh attack attack kim  kardashian at the same time yeah kim  kardashian's a fucking idiot again she's  like these gun laws have to be changed  and then i was like well because here's  a list she mentioned the chicago thing  yeah 19 people were shot in chicago as  well exactly same thing though she's like  we gotta have gun laws gun laws i heard  the most it was it was the most uh the 
[02:16:00]  easiest way to sum everything up and it  was in a car that was passing me now you  just kind of hear a snippet of whatever's  going by in someone's car so someone had  some talk radio on and as it went by me  it was just like uh adding gun laws  doesn't really take the guns out of the  hands of the irresponsible and that was  all i heard and that's all you need it's  i'm just throwing my hands up in the  parking lot i'm like yes that's all you  need it's it's fucking that's the that's  the whole argument and it couldn't have  been more true i love hearing three  second conversations as i walk on the  sidewalk wasn't a beginning a middle and  an end it all makes sense i would say 
[02:16:30]  but sometimes you hear some shit you're  like fuck i want to follow that person  now what the hell was that about there  was a kim kardashian she said her dumb  shit and then i just posted i was like  okay here are the laws for new york city  here are the laws for new york city and  here's what it takes to get a gun and  here's what happens if you don't have  this in place and you have a gun here's  what laws you're breaking here's the  prison terms here's all the info you  need as far as what new york city's  already doing as far as laws go what 
[02:17:00]  more laws can you possibly pass well you  can't the second this thing went down on  what was that friday my dad posted like  a picture of like a like a revolver and  like the the barrel is tied in a knot and  it was like enough already and it's like  enough of what like what enough of what  if a crazy person wants to get something  done with a gun they're gonna go and  they're gonna have the means to find  that gun if they're motivated enough and  carry out whatever their intended plan  was let me ask you this was he a legal  gun owner no no he never was and i said  the same thing i said if you think it's  so easy because i said well what should we  do about it he goes make them more 
[02:17:30]  difficult to get i said they're already  difficult to get and i laid out the  whole thing as i mean i know new york i  can't speak for jersey or connecticut but  i know new york and it's very difficult  to do anything in new york if you don't  have a license which means you went  through all kinds of background checks  in new york and forget about the city  i'm just talking new york state you  cannot even walk into a gun store and  say could i see that and have him take  a pistol out and and hold it but how did  this guy get this kind of feels good he  went to florida back in 91 he bought a 
[02:18:00]  gun in florida in 1991 and then brought  it up here the second he left florida it  became an illegal weapon but it still  should be harder to get though because  the thinking is that if he didn't have  that gun if it had been harder to get  in florida then the cops would not have  had to like if it was a knife or another  weapon the cops wouldn't have had to  pull and fire into a crowd if he wanted  a gun he would have been able to get  one in some or even if the criteria was  more uh stringent in florida he wanted a  gun and he's had it it wasn't like he 
[02:18:30]  bought a spur of the moment he had it  since 1991 let me ask you rusty should  we have the same gun laws in every state  would that help uh no a lot of states  don't want that some states are very  adamant about where where they are so  is that is that part of the problem  that uh it's easy to get guns in other  states it's not a problem it's part of  what it is it's part of what you know  the states the states have their own  fucking laws as far as uh guns go because  if you have no licensing some have  strictest this motherfucker like we all  know if you could get a gun easier in 
[02:19:00]  another state it's so easy to get it to  new york city and it's illegal to do it  though what other laws are you can't  stop people from buying something  because you can then bring it somewhere  else well i'm just asking the tough  questions i have a solution i'm just  asking the tough questions because  it's it's not going to scare anyone if  they go to another state to get a gun  legally and then bring it to new york  because they know no one's going to  fucking check your trunk or anything for  a gun two years mandatory prison that's  what i'm asking but that's what they  have if you're caught in new york with a  gun regardless if you use it or not 
[02:19:30]  you could take your gun and beat some  man over the head that's stabbing a  nun and you will get two years in  prison just for having mandatory right  mandatory so is that is that enough of  a deterrent for some people no but 10  years won't be enough of a deterrent i'm  just asking oh i'm just arguing i have  it by the way i don't even know i don't  even know what my status is i have the  solution this way each state can have  their own gun laws what you do is in in  the guns when you make them you put 
[02:20:00]  something um that is in that is  impossible to take out that makes the  gun traceable trackable like uh i don't  want to say you know a chip what's that  or some type of a something in there so  the second that that gun crosses state  lines there's a gps track that knows  it's done oh that's crazy you can't  infringe on somebody's uh privacy like  that no no no but it's tracking guns it  would be then tracking people that have  guns it's it no one would go for you 
[02:20:30]  put something where it doesn't it does  not activate or or do that or maybe you  need a warrant to do or this there should  be safeguards in place so that people's  privacy is not infringed on and so that  people who are just honest gun owners  you are not tracked that's logistically  pretty hard to do and then no one would  trust the fact that you have something  that's tracking in your gun uh no one  would trust the fact that it's not being  abused to uh why not see what is happening 
[02:21:00]  in our cell phones every day as we speak  that's exactly in our cell phones they  can track they can track our gps the  cars a cell phone isn't sold with the  feature hey we can find you it's part of  what it is if you say we're going to take  a gun and and put a tracking device in  it it's been hell but why but why think  about it though but that's a because i  know but look at the it would i think  help a lot of the problem the minute that  that gun crossed a state line it a 
[02:21:30]  fucking a sensor going you don't think  some homie would fucking know how to  just bash it out with a nail or  something not if it's mashed into the uh  you gotta mush it in there good  you really put a lot of tape on it i  don't shit in there i don't see that  happening it sounds good but it's a  little naive jimmy but why to think  that why with technology the way it is  why should guns have the same trace  ability they had in 1506 with  technology the way it is we're still  firing out lead slugs really fast at  someone lasers i'm gonna throw this 
[02:22:00]  metal at you really fast but no i think  that's very very doable you think gun  violence is a huge problem in this  country uh i think in certain inner  city areas it is i don't think these  these one in a thousand fucking one in a  million i think there's there's uh way  worse things gun violence is a problem  the same way that red wine will make you  live forever it's one of those stories  that pops up every now and again it's  hot now and then it goes away the second  part of it because i was i was going  somewhere with this i mean cars kill so  many more fucking people every year 
[02:22:30]  they see that as a necessity we need to  get around it's a necessary evil but we  talk about a lot on this show we could  easily make our highways better we'd  choose not to how about the fact that  why because it costs what what is that  cost it is cost because we know that is  a major fucking problem i think the  driving test should be a lot harder hold  on we pretty much all every single one  of us knows at least one person that  has died in a car yeah i i in my i know  i'm trying to think it probably at least 
[02:23:00]  10 if you knew that many people that  died of anything else you'd be like wow  something's got to be done right but we  choose not to we can make it safer we  absolutely can i know they've changed i  know we've changed some of the shit in  our cars and stuff but it's the highways  themselves some of the shit we do is  crazy we all accept the risk of driving  right we accept it uh people have  acceptable risk with certain things and  they they don't have any tolerance for  it in other things like guns people  don't like the idea that guns around  yet they hop in a car every day knowing 
[02:23:30]  that their odds of getting killed by that  car are a fuck of a lot better than it  is with a gun and alcohol and right  exactly everything else exactly to the  fucking mix i think there should be a  much more difficult driving test uh i think  too many people are out there driving  with such basic knowledge of driving  right i think you ought to have a  knowledge of what your machine is even  doing how it works well i think the  same should be said for uh gun purchases  as well you should be you should know  how your your weapon works and you  should you should have to be able to  pass some kind of range exam you should 
[02:24:00]  be able to you should know how it works  and take it yeah because anybody could  just go not anybody but i mean if  someone wants to go and just buy a  rifle they could just do that as long  as they have as long as they have a  clean history uh nothing going on they  can do that and not know how the  that i just think this problem is blown  out of proportion all the time in the  media and then you look at something  like chicago again a banner weekend for  chicago fucking shootings uh and this  happens every single weekend in chicago  but for some reason i guess those people  aren't as important because they're not 
[02:24:30]  a movie theater full of people and it's  not one one gunman and it's black on  black um if a white guy if or a group  of white people were shooting 37  37 people over the weekend this this  weekend 37 people were shot nine killed  in chicago if there was a just a roving  gang of white people doing this it would  be insane but why does the race matter  so much when the end result is these  people are dead why is this so bad in  chicago the fucking and here's why and 
[02:25:00]  who's second and and how far you got  when you got someone like ram emmanuel in  there tying the police hands behind their  back and you have this liberal fucking  government in in chicago they don't want  to do what's tough to do which is crack  down on these motherfuckers how about  some fucking stop and frisks no we can't  do that but so they live with 37 people  getting shot nine killed every weekend i'm  not done with my idea oh i'm telling you  if you put something that you cannot take 
[02:25:30]  out that fucking guns can be traced why  would anybody object to it like uh why  would law-abiding citizens object to that  if they know the motive is is to track  when things are are brought illegally like  if you're an honest gun owner and you have  a gun at your house and you all your guns  are legal like there's no reason for that  to ever come up it's so value so if i drive 
[02:26:00]  somewhere and i cross a state line to get  to a state that i'm legally able to carry  in that sensor is going to go off yeah and  and track me i don't want that but that  doesn't attract but again you put your  cell phone against your cell phone let  him use my cell phone but what's the  greater good a gun owner not liking  himself being tracked or because the  government doesn't care if you have  phones the government does at some point  care that you have guns and that's been  the whole gist of the second amendment is 
[02:26:30]  the fact that the people should be  uninfringed upon to own guns and not  have to be accountable to the government  as to uh where they are with that gun at  any moment um there are laws you must  adhere to but that's what the laws are  for they never saw this coming though and  honestly i firmly believe in the second  amendment but they never saw this coming  they never saw this problem if you they  had no comprehension that this problem 
[02:27:00]  would exist the way it does i there's no  way that the and the mindset of the  people i've said this before who wrote  the constitution does matter there's no  way that they understood the amount of  of civilians that would be killed with  first of all i don't think guns were as  portable but like all the all the things  that have changed they just didn't see  coming you don't think they saw there  was going to be they saw it in their  own history especially during uh the  revolutionary war the advancement of 
[02:27:30]  weaponry they saw it they knew weapons  were going to advance they didn't put a  fucking footnote in there that said  well if weapons get to the point where  they can do this then we got to change  it they knew it was going to advance they  saw an advancement so why wasn't  something put in there as a a stopgap  maybe what they did because maybe what  they didn't see was the breakdown of  society or the way life is not valued  as much they probably they probably  didn't see gay marriage coming either  like there's so many things that have 
[02:28:00]  happened in a couple hundred years that  they never saw coming and uh they  didn't they didn't count for it did  any of uh the founding fathers talk  later in their lives about some of this  shit oh i don't know like last week  they were probably all when they wrote  it though i mean none of those guys  were pretty old i mean they're probably  at least in the 40s i think there's  one guy that went oh all of their  quote no all of their quotes that i've  read on the second amendment has been  very pro second amendment later in  their lives yeah during their entire  lives they always have these quotes  about the fact that the people it's 
[02:28:30]  their right to be armed and and why  they gave them that right and and it's  been pretty consistent throughout their  lives from the quotes i've read sure i  don't know it just seems to me that if  you have a societal breakdown if you  have fucking uh inner city crime and  shit like that it's a it's a horrible  thing to do to infringe upon your  rights to try to stop something  instead of dealing with the actual  problem but the founding fathers for  all and much as i've shit on them for  being slave owners i mean as far as i 
[02:29:00]  mean they did do some brilliant things  with the bill obviously they had this  the the original uh whatever the  original bill of rights was the  original constitution they did the  the miranda rights were not in that i  mean that was and when miranda i think  years later that came that came in the  1900s i think right well yeah you can  you can but i mean that's how that's  how and the constitution without but you  can only do it if you're not taking away  a right you can add to sure all right 
[02:29:30]  you can't take away a right with another  amendment i don't want to take a right  away i'm only saying as far as what they  foresaw happening this was a group of  people very concerned about government  infringement so concerned they wanted  to arm themselves but they didn't even  think to put in that you had to be told  what your rights were like this basic  thing that we take for granted that's  so obvious now there was a very long  time where that didn't exist well we  had to wait for miranda to be born yeah  i suppose so you also think those 
[02:30:00]  puritanical motherfuckers would have  allowed first amendment protection for  rap lyrics do you honestly think they you  say well they didn't know how it was  going to get do you honestly think  those motherfuckers those church going  christian jesus motherfuckers would  have liked to protect uh with the first  amendment that kind of speech no i'm  sure they wouldn't i'm sure they  wouldn't have either but i so you can't  constantly look as to what they would  have thought but no no but their intent 
[02:30:30]  but their intent was to cover unpopular  speak like with the stuff that they were  saying that was unpopular even though the  language nobody talked like that back  then but they were protecting things  that were anti-government and and like  things that were as rebellious as rap  lyrics are considered now yeah you didn't  curse and go yo niggas back then but  when you i think ben franklin did i'm  sure he did but he whispered it but when  you said things back then it was it was  eloquent and it was about the government  but they were as as anti what's the word 
[02:31:00]  i'm looking for as as against the grain  maybe as rap lyrics are so i think they  would have been a lot more and i don't  think that they would have not had the  second amendment if they even if they  foresaw but i think that they would  have reworded it or they would have been  comfortable with certain restrictions  being put on or certain things uh being  put in place i don't think they would  have been like it's a free-for-all they  didn't see society breaking down like it  has they just didn't see it coming no but  but a societal breakdown doesn't mean you 
[02:31:30]  have to infringe on someone's rights and  i think as far as you were saying about  the first amendment and them you know  protecting speech that was as rebellious  then as you know certain rap lyrics are  now well you can apply that to the  second amendment also knowing they you  have to assume that they knew things  were going to change uh even with the  first amendment and protected speech so  the second yet had to know that they  knew that was going to change and  nothing's put in there as far as this is  inalienable inalienable inalienable 
[02:32:00]  thank you i had a mind fart right there  uh it's it's it's so simple and so  basic that your rights shall not be  infringed upon uh not with an asterisk to  it but i don't disagree about people i  think people should be able to own guns  i'm for it i just think that it gets  unreasonable like when when in the with  the way things are now when you say like  tracking guns and again i know it sounds 
[02:32:30]  crazy but again eventually we're going  to have little things in our fingers  where paper money will eventually be a  thing in the past like you know i mean  like the technology is very around the  corner for all that they could easily put  that in guns easily and it would just  make them all traceable if you're a law  abiding citizen and your gun is where it  is then then we're happy that you have it  good but if you're a criminal or if your  gun is stolen or if your gun is being  used in a robbery somewhere well then i  think that society has a right to know 
[02:33:00]  that and i think us protecting ourselves  from people abusing the right of the  second amendment is also very important  the second amendment is very important  but i think that a lot of people who  wrote the constitution didn't understand  that the rest of us have to protect  ourselves from people abusing it and we  do i i understand that but i i'm just  not getting the whole um you're you're  expected privacy for your gun ownership  from the government that's a very  important part of what they wanted is 
[02:33:30]  is they the government should not know  who has and i know it's out there i  really know it's out there there are  there's so much paperwork you have to go  through in this day and age but it's  not this instantaneous knowledge of where  you are with your gun and you mean to  tell me that would never be used let's  say let's say you're you had a nasty  divorce sure uh you have a gun you  never intend on doing anybody harm but  now you're driving towards the city that 
[02:34:00]  your ex-wife is in now you mean to tell  me that'll never be used as a kind of uh  you know this is iffy is he going to  kill his ex-wife maybe we ought to stop  him maybe you want to ask what and all  of a sudden it becomes a thing where now  this technology is being used as some  type of preemptive uh strike well maybe  you don't interfere with the person  driving maybe the thing is my hearty  report yes if the ex-wife wants to know  and she's had a violent relationship  maybe she has the right to know that 
[02:34:30]  this guy is driving towards her so maybe  that that instead of infringing on the  guy maybe you just see where he's going  you don't do anything about like and  again with everything gps everybody  knows we are anyway but maybe the fact  that her she can be informed that this  ex-husband is driving towards her  maybe fuck his right to privacy because  he's probably going to shoot her like  you know i mean in those extreme cases  maybe that happens a lot so i don't want  his rights infringed upon but i don't  have any problem with her and i 
[02:35:00]  understand what you mean about being  tracked like i don't disagree with you  totally on that either but there has to  be a way to make it work and just  because i don't have it all worked out  doesn't mean that you get it worked  out jimmy well i've just come up with  this bill it's called the uh it's  called the trace guns with computers  bill  can i tell you what i heard in the  gym oh that's pretty big kid  i love your radio show  thanks this fucking guy it was when 
[02:35:30]  the whole thing was going down and  outside the empire state building  obviously yeah i'd have the show went  to the gym and uh the guy goes uh  wow you hear what happened at the  empire state building it's like yeah  man guns are a problem this country  then he goes to this guy he goes this  is what they should do and we've all  heard and seen this guy here this is  what they should do they should make  bullets illegal and then he goes  think about it and walks away  dramatically like you just made a  great point yeah think about it and  then walks nice i'm sitting at this  machine going oh my god oh my god 
[02:36:00]  think about it that's what they should  do make the bullets illegal  i don't know just trade just track  them and this way when they go over  the border illegally we know where they  are it's very possible and what's  wrong with no but then again i mean  let's get the death penalty involved  that'd be cool too i would love to  know where the guns are but i'm happy  to have citizens with guns  citizens with guns i'm very pleased that  people can own guns yeah they should be 
[02:36:30]  able to there is an expectation of  privacy to to a certain extent and that  that would be a real infringement on  on your isn't the nra would be against  that they don't even like they don't  even like when uh they want to alter  when the government wants to alter guns  for tracking in any way shape or form  because they even wanted to do it in an  analog sense by every firing pin would  have a special etching on it uh that 
[02:37:00]  when they pick up shell casing they  could trace that right back to the gun  sure um easily destroyed easily filed  off um so the only people that would be  using it and be able to held it be held  accountable are legal gun owners which  you know it's a waste of time money uh  cost for the gun manufacturers to have  to read mill and retool things um so i  don't know i don't i don't have an  answer but i don't think the problem is 
[02:37:30]  as serious that it merits some type of  widespread infringement on law-abiding  citizens rights that's all i mean if  somebody wants to kill somebody and i  guess if the easiest thing would be to  use a gun if now you can't get a gun  but the intent is still there don't you  just pick up a knife a knife you know  how many stabbings and bludgeonings  there are in england there was almost  one in times square it's crazy how come  we're not all banning knives all yeah  that guy's terrible did you hear about  that thing in times square there's two  many knives in the country i think  short beat knife that day and all we 
[02:38:00]  should do we should we can accept knives  for some reason i think it's the ability  of knives you know you can run away  from a knife yeah i think it's more the  ability of a gun to that piece of shit  was able to run exactly i think it's the  ability of a gun to catch you across  the street that bugs us all the way  those the way those cops were firing at  that guy i'd be more worried about about  if they had a knife on him i'd be like  well he's not going to hit me but if he  had a knife then he might be able to be  in range of me but i'm not worried  about firing blindly with one arm with  his one-armed fucking stance we're 
[02:38:30]  making fun of that lady and of course  someone has to say it's hard to say  what anyone would really do when  bullets start flying i know that i know  what i was going to look at because we  weren't there i'd fucking i would  fucking just start saying funny stuff  like oh these are really bullets of a  broadway you think someone stopped to  laugh yeah the gunman i have a few  laughs you hear about this creep  though more info coming out about him  he uh lived on the upper east side  yeah he got fired how long ago now  like a little over a year right a while  ago and he's been wearing the same 
[02:39:00]  gray suit every day he leaves his  apartment every day in the same gray  suit he goes and gets a cup of coffee  everyone knew him up there for being a  little strange and on friday he handed  his keys in because they were redoing his  apartment that he was uh renting i guess  yeah yeah subleasing some kind of weird  thing and said look here's the keys  and everyone's worried where are you  gonna live and he's like oh you don't  have to worry about me i'll i'll never  be back and that was it i would love  downtown and shot his old boss yeah i 
[02:39:30]  would love the fbi to release the facts  of this and like a profiler to go over  this and tell you exactly what the  company did wrong meaning there's ways to  see this violence coming never surprised  well they both apparently had restraining  orders out on each other and there was  always some kind of uh problem when they  uh saw each other um he did say at one  point that i'm gonna kill you and uh he  reported it but i mean but it's the guns 
[02:40:00]  it's the guns yeah it's the gun that damn  gun yeah but just because the guy was  crazy it does it doesn't negate the fact  that that guns are an issue it's not saying  that guns are everything and i understand  people kill guns don't jump up and do it  by themselves but it doesn't negate the  fact that the problem exists just because  this guy was a crazy fuck you know i mean  the problem still does exist i i would i  would totally before um the background  checks um you know i don't mind that i 
[02:40:30]  don't mind them running my name through  the fbi database every time i go to buy  a gun fine uh but how much is that really  going to help all right so now you got to  go an extra step and an extra step a lot  of these guys especially recently they've  had no criminal uh previous criminal records  there's no way to really weed them out  what as nuts that you shouldn't have  cracked the guns what about making the  penalties just brutal for using an illegal  gun again chicago has i mean the most  brutal gun laws there are and how bad is 
[02:41:00]  the most how bad is it uh first of all  you're not even allowed to carry a gun okay  what happens if you kill someone with an  illegal gun if you kill someone you're  gonna get life in prison life in prison yeah  what if you just uh maim them yeah i don't  know i guess up to the judge but those  guys are all wondering if there's any  way to do that make the the penalties  just brutal death penalty shit like get  real crazy if you're out on the street  with a gun in chicago you're breaking the  law instantly right how do we stop that  but you're not you're scared of getting  killed so like for them like for us we 
[02:41:30]  can't comprehend that but when you're  living in that life literally you are  watching your friends get shot you're  so the fucking the idea of going to jail  or the gun laws are irrelevant yeah  because the price for not having one is  you're going to get shot and it becomes  logical to walk out of your own house  with a gun but it's a cultural problem  it's not a fucking hardware problem i  mean it's a cultural fucking problem  that they're killing each other over  there someone says you got the chicago  thing wrong i just want to make sure  are you're allowed to have a gun in  chicago but you can't leave your house 
[02:42:00]  yeah you can oh and that you still need  crazy fucking documentation because i've  always thought how you have said it over  the years that you're just not allowed  to own a gun that's new that was new  you can use a few people hit me up on  twitter i'm just wondering you can have  one in your house but you can't leave  your house with a gun oh i don't think  you can not even have a handgun uh but i  know damn well you can't walk the streets  none of these shootings are happening in  people's houses are you allowed to have  a handgun in chicago in your own home  uh no i think you could have a shotgun or  rifle and you can't obviously take that 
[02:42:30]  out on the street oh shut up  master queef what do you say i do not and  and chicago's got some of the toughest  fucking gun laws there are stop it don't  quibble with me you're quibbling  quibble no you're quibbling who wants to  be told they're they're quibbling he is  quibbling he's an idiot  why don't we uh take a break uh you find  the brian reagan the other bit because 
[02:43:00]  people said that was the wrong bit i got  the other bit i told everybody everybody  looked at me like i was fucking little  fat tits jimmy but that was right but it  was a good bit it was topical but now we  got the other bit do you want do you want  the foot it's there's a four minute  version or i can cut it into like a one and  a half we better go four minutes to get  the essence of his comedy so yeah i would  hate to edit his yeah i don't like editing  anyone's comedy you don't fuck with art  that's right four minutes brian reagan  talking about walking on the moon because 
[02:43:30]  the neil armstrong thing  about an hour ago but it's still  you'll laugh whatever hit it i'm  actually kind of quiet off stage a lot  of people don't realize that i was at a  dinner party recently a bunch of people  that i don't know one guy talking plenty  for everybody and then me myself right  and then i and then myself right me me i  couldn't tell this one about i because i  was talking about myself and then me me  beware the me monster 
[02:44:00]  so i tried to jump in with a little  story i don't want to just sit there the  whole night right when i'm done with my  story this guy goes that ain't nothing  didn't mean to waste everybody's time  telling my nothing story here let marco  polo speak he's back with tales of 
[02:44:30]  adventure  the story ain't nothing  maybe it wasn't because i made the  mistake of trying to tell a story about  having only two wisdom teeth pulled and i  learned a lesson  don't ever try to tell a two wisdom tooth  story  because you ain't going nowhere  the four wisdom teeth people are going  to parachute in  and cut you off at the pass  halt  halt with your two wisdom tooth tail 
[02:45:00]  you will never complete one trust me  i'm trying to tell my story you know i had  some wisdom teeth pulled i had um  i had two but i had four pulled  no five no nine i had nine wisdom teeth  pulled  all of mine were impacted they were all  coming upside down the roots wrapped  around my tongue coming out my nose  they were tusks i was a warthog no  anesthesia they pulled them out with 
[02:45:30]  pliers i was eating corn in the cob that  afternoon  pin the blue ribbon upon his chest  that knocks the socks off of my wisdom  tooth tail  why do people need to top other people  i've never understood it and i see it  all the time  obviously people get something out of it  at best people wait for your lips to  stop  yeah  okay yeah you me 
[02:46:00]  you me you see the difference  you see you see that  now i do  what is it about the human condition  people get something out of that  that's why i have a social fantasy  i wish i was one of the 12 astronauts  who have been on our moon  they must love knowing they can beat  anybody's story  whenever they want 
[02:46:30]  they can sit back quietly at a dinner  party while some other person some  me monster is doing his thing and let  him go  let him run with the line while you be  quiet  let him have his moment yeah i'm a big  traveler i have my business all i got  my own global enterprise i got a check  you know i'm driving in the autobahn  because i keep a fleet of sports cars  over in zurich  you know there's a swiss account  that i have to check  mount kilimanjaro expedition  you might have to cancel that  you know runway's an aspirin a lot 
[02:47:00]  shorter the first time you go in  there you know you have that  pacific room company  we're going to try to take that  over and  global enterprise  i walked on the moon  well you have the floor moonwalker  you know you mentioned driving on the 
[02:47:30]  autobahn that reminded me once i was  driving in the sea of tranquility  in my lunar rover  and i too was worried about our speed  till i remembered wait we're the only  ones on the moon  you guys are great thank you very much  sirius xm  this is the op and anthony show 
[02:48:00]  yo colin quinn what's up  colin  what's going on  hi sir  i'm calling for two reasons  yes  one is i don't know how you train your  people  but they're very impolite  dumb roland i see him in long island city  the other day  we're the only two people on the whole  fucking block 
[02:48:30]  and meanwhile we had discussed  long island city  how he was going to come see me  which he never  did he lives like a block  from where i was doing the show  and then i go  roland  roland  and he starts skulking like  you ever see rubenga  when he goes into the refugee camp  rubenga  fucking skulking like  he's literally like  got a bag full of chow corn or something  and then 
[02:49:00]  to make matters worse  asshole norton  i put a little like  i called  i placed a couple of calls to him  you know  and you don't leave messages these days  you know  you do it hip style  you just kind of leave your number  and then they call you  this asshole doesn't call me back  so then i tweet  i tweet at him  i'm like  you know  when you tweet at somebody  they usually get  this prick still doesn't get back to me  like two days later  hold on  i'm looking right now  through all of my missed calls 
[02:49:30]  oh  and i do not see  one from you  oh  whoa  maybe check on the liar  colin quinn  but  i'm just gonna say  why would i make that up  you probably dialed  i don't think you're lying  i think you dialed the wrong number  because you're old  and your fingers are thin  and you probably hit the wrong one  you probably called somebody else  jim belushi  look on your tweets  i haven't checked my twitter  he said look on your sweet ass  i think  hold on  hold on  i'm trying to find it  when did you tweet me  shut up 
[02:50:00]  i'm sick of this liar  and everyone's going wrong  with this  fucking liar  i didn't know you tweeted me  i would have acknowledged it  with a little hay  or an lol  roland what happened  why didn't uh  why didn't you uh  recognize colin  i can't  bang  honestly  the tweet could be a problem  a mistake on my part  because jim's  the default avatar  looks like jim's headshot  uh-huh  the what  the default avatar 
[02:50:30]  the default the egg  okay now i'm seeing it  i'm seeing it now  it was the 25th  at 3 15 p.m  that was yesterday right  i was fast  oh you're really a fish  and gong  it was the 25th  shut up  it was two days ago  oh  called jim norton  to tell him a funny run-in  i had with roland yesterday  never heard back  that's cool he's busy  i didn't um  and i wouldn't classify that  as a funny run-in  i would i would classify that  as a justifiably ignored  by roland  i would never ignore him 
[02:51:00]  my friend lives in that building  he's  i thought it was him  just busting my balls  i can't see that far  roland can't see that far  i can't see that far  can we do an eye test  with roland right now  yeah that is  your eyes are pretty bad  is it easy to get that chart  yeah yeah we could do that  and how many feet  we'll figure it out  i only got two feet  how many you got  i thought i heard my name  but i didn't quite know  and i just saw a person  i was like  i don't know who that  you recognize colin's voice  i mean roland  who else could that be  well i don't know  i went across the street once 
[02:51:30]  it wasn't  i thought someone was calling me  and the girl goes  what are you doing  i thought you called me  she goes no no  i'm like ah damn it  fucking  idiots  i've heard roland is very blind  we're gonna give him  an eye test today  i want to know how blind he is  anyway  i am gonna laugh  that's all i have  that's it  i'm gonna laugh at re-benga  re-benga  he's soaked off like  re-benga  see you guys later 
[02:52:00]  take it easy call  oh am i gonna laugh  about that all day  oh oh oh oh  yes  he gone  he gone  he gone  i hate that  isn't that chicago  who's that fucking baseball  announcer for the white sox  i think  he gone  he gone  that's his home run call  he gone  that's when they strike out  somebody  he gone  i fucking hate that  are you a jets fan  no  no  i'm not  oh roland is  hi roland  what happened 
[02:52:30]  they look shitty though  i heard that  well it's  it is pre-season  but the fact remains  they haven't  thrown for a touchdown yet  remember the big  you know  qb controversy  they got two  two qbs  they got two qbs  and they can't  not one of them  could get the fucking  ball in the end zone  yeah  they have not  he won't try  a touchdown yet  they came close  but nothing  they came close  but nothing  so we're a little nervous  jet nation is a little nervous  oh  everybody is so into  their fantasy football 
[02:53:00]  i've noticed a lot of  tweets about their  even our own  travis i guess  is involved in this  travis had two good picks  travis  those were my first two picks  i have a very good team  do you  i think so  who are some of your  standouts  who do you  you know  i got  i mean  i got stafford  in my second pick  which i'm very happy about  no  he's  anthony  he's the quarterback  for the lions  not a fucking clue  not even the slightest  you don't like fantasy football  fantasy football is fun  and it's so much easier  than fantasy baseball  because you only have to  worry about it once a week 
[02:53:30]  i don't even get it  and i'm in first place  in fantasy baseball  so  um  very good  do i get the red zone  this year  tom warner  no  no  we are the only ones  tom warner  fucks you over  oh man  even even cable vision  time warner is the last holdout  they're terrible  cable vision signed a deal  with the nfl network  i don't believe in that  fios though  time warner is the last one  fios rules  how many years  how many years  how many years right  that you've been trying to  tell me to do this  you got files jimmy  love it  all right i'm coming over  for red zone 
[02:54:00]  it's phenomenal  nice  i'll get a red zone  at your house  all right  i know what i read  shut up  yeah  i know that um  some people are annoyed  they didn't get to see  breaking bad  wow  why didn't they  well there's a problem  i'm not going to mention it  here because i might have  to talk about them in a  minute  oh  really  yeah  uh  yeah  yeah  there's a problem with  the amc  don't look over there  i want to do this eye exam  how many feedback does he 
[02:54:30]  have to go  don't look i said  i go don't look  so what does he do  it's not roland  it's not roland  edgar jesus  how many feet danny  well he should really be  20 feet away  and i don't think we have  that kind of room in here  so we'll have to go outside  but you know what  if he's across  if he's as bad as he  as he says  yeah get him to the couch  go to the couch  i don't think he'll make it  so  go all the way to the couch  as far back as you can  is that 20 feet in it  that's not  that's uh  probably 15  15  if colin was way farther  that's why  you know you'll find out  so you're cheating  imagine from the dorsal  to the tail fin 
[02:55:00]  roland read the first  line  f  okay go  f  it is f  all right  second one  b c  he's already having  a problem  no he's okay  he's got it  but he's got it  but he's having a problem  line two  is his mic working  hold on hold on  get a mic near you  um  p  okay  t  e  o  okay  all right  we're good  next one  ah fuck me  um  nope  looks like a  yeah  b 
[02:55:30]  z  f  e  d  i don't know  what's that  he got that right  yeah he got that one  all right  but barely  q  so it's not that bad  huh  d  uh huh  c d  t  a  is it  whoa  okay  all right  that one you really  fucking dropped the ball on  so it's the fifth line  wow  yeah i mean  is that bad  he's between 20 30 20 40 
[02:56:00]  but again he's not a full 20 feet back  yeah and colin was at least like 70  he was like way up  when i saw like a little wave i'm like  i don't know who  boland is blind  yeah  boland could use it he could use a little prescription  yeah  now i need it from 20 feet  i don't think i don't think he would have gotten the 20 40 line  he would have died after f  oh kenny  what's wrong kenny  kenny thinks it's one long word  i was i was doing it from outside the glass  you can go out there and look  all right go outside the glass  kenya 
[02:56:30]  kenny what's 20  what's 20 feet you think  you're supposed to cover one eye  i'll do it  are you  well i got the each eye  but we'll go with two  go outside now  oh yeah  because that's the extra five feet  when he starts to like uh answer  or reading the lines as questions  then you know it's getting into trouble  bc  bc  i got 20 30 according to that 
[02:57:00]  oh yeah  is that about right  well i guess 20 20 is the best  but 20 30 you can drive and shit  was that iq 20 30  all right hold on here he is  all right  all right rollin start with the first line  f  okay f  bc  yeah  remember that  yeah  um  c  uh 
[02:57:30]  uh  uh  uh  i don't know what that was  i i  that thing looks like a note at the end  but the two i don't know  so what is it  the ched don't know  the ched don't know  p  t  t  d  o  oh my god  so what's that  he added an extra letter  adding letters  it wasn't even there  2050  2050's really bad right  yeah  oh my god  yeah  2050  jesus 
[02:58:00]  all right rollin  that killed two minutes  thanks  b  q  oh  his eyes fucking suck a dick  yeah  yeah  there's his mouth  so audio we didn't get to last week  it's terrific audio  dana white cancels ufc 151  which would have been this past saturday  yep  and uh  it's all over um  john  it would have been this coming saturday  oh okay you're right  uh  oh yeah yeah  you're right  absolutely right  uh  john jones decided not to take a fight with chel sunnan  it was offered 
[02:58:30]  what happened was i think  that  originally  i think they had asked a couple of people  i think  uh  leota machida  but he didn't want to fight him right away  and there was a couple of other names i think that came up  and uh  then chel  jumped up  but chel was not just sitting on a couch  he was training with henderson  and jones is saying he would have had three days notice  because the last five days are cutting weight  and  doing press  no it's easy to get crazy to have to do 
[02:59:00]  i mean  really  you couldn't fight like that  it's easy to hate john jones  period  yeah it's easy to be annoyed  period  yeah  sure  i don't know man  he'd make some valid points i think  i mean  i don't think uh  a fight card should be cancelled over one fight  should be  the card should be a little stronger no  the reason i'm not sure about it is because  um  i mean the headline event's the headline event  um  a john jones championship fight  is a very tough one to replace on a card  like you know  even if the bottom of the card is really good 
[02:59:30]  that's a big fucking  that's the draw  you still need something  yeah  gotcha  and  for  the  the  dana or those  they're thinking is he should have just  and rogan tweeted he was shocked  and a lot of fighters have been surprised  so i'm kind of  now why was he shocked  because joe obviously knows this sport  because he's saying i can't believe john jones  wouldn't take a fight with a guy who hasn't been  training for the fight like  why wouldn't he take that fight  um  and a lot of people think as a champion  you always got to be ready to go  and you're contracted for a fight 
[03:00:00]  and um  it happens before  where a lot of times people do swap out  it's just i guess  people get hurt in training  probably more than in boxing  because you're using more  like you know i mean  there's a lot of takedowns  like henderson  i think in a takedown defense  hurt his face  it is a sport that happens  yeah  frequently  because there's so much more body  way more than boxing  well yeah definitely more in training  way more yeah  uh but then again  in the foreman  in foreman ali fight  foreman got cut  in zaire  they didn't bring in a replacement  they waited six weeks and fought  that's obviously a different  didn't have to wait 
[03:00:30]  in there for six weeks  yeah in zaire  that's part of the documentary  they're just sitting around  waiting for him to heal  yeah  uh so this is  data white  he is pissed  yeah  most have heard the audio by now  but  i have not  you haven't heard the audio  neither  okay  so this is probably  one of my all-time  hellos  uh  as being president of the ufc  over the last 11 years  for the first time  in uh  in 11 years  we're going to cancel an event  this saturday's fight 
[03:01:00]  at mantelay bay  is uh  is being canceled  dan henderson  has a partial tear  in his mcl  and  couldn't continue  couldn't  you know  he tried to  he tried to train  he tried to  to continue to work out  he saw doctors  and there was nothing  we could do  to uh  to save that fight  so  one of the things  that you guys have heard me  brag about a million times  is how  ufc doesn't have to 
[03:01:30]  cancel events  we can uh  you know  we can always find  a replacement  for somebody to fight  john jones  on eight days notice  it is tough to do  but  to be totally honest  with you guys  one guy did  not only when i called him  did he say  i'll take the fight  he said i'll fly to las vegas  tonight  and fight him  and that was chael sonan  chael sonan  accepted the fight  with with with john jones 
[03:02:00]  wanted to fight bad  so  as of  you know  eight nine o'clock  last night  we had a fight  we here at the ufc  started working  started uh  you know  creating different commercials  pr started getting ready  to crank up  i was going to do this call  and this was obviously  going to be a much different  call this morning  uh  but  the one thing  that i never thought  in a million years  would happen  happened  john jones said  i'm not fighting chael sonan  with eight days notice 
[03:02:30]  again something that's never  happened in ufc history  a guy who's a world champion  and considered one of the  pound for pound best  turns down  uh  a fight  so that has never  happened either  wow  chael sonan  all right so i don't  understand that  sonan  all right i had it all  backwards  what do you mean  why isn't he fighting him  why isn't he fighting sonan  well  why wouldn't he  i'll tell you what  his trainer greg jackson  advised him against it  and this is their thinking  from what i can tell 
[03:03:00]  because  henderson was training  chael was helping  henderson  train for the jones fight  so it wasn't like  he was just sitting on a couch  doing nothing  he probably was not  in fighting shape  but jones was training  for a fight  i think jones  he should be ready  i thought he was the one  that  from all the hubbub i heard  i actually thought he was  the one that got called up  last minute  no  no but jones  isn't fighting for a while  still  another month right  the next ufc event  uh  well now they've pushed it  back  yes  but he was on the card 
[03:03:30]  yes for this one  but they pushed it to the next one  so he should have fought  well the reason  wait john jones was on this card too  this was the card he was on  yeah  he got pushed back to the next one  you're thinking the same thing  i was thinking  i'm fucking confused  see  here's the fight  john jones was definitely fighting  john jones  was gonna fight ufc  dan henderson  was supposed to fight  this coming saturday  right  henderson hurt his knee  right  he wanted to fight  he couldn't  so they tried to find  a replacement fight  for jones  oh my god  i'm with anthony  i'm a dummy  yes  hey  he was scheduled to fight 
[03:04:00]  sorry about that  he was scheduled to fight  i'm a dummy on this one  we're both dummies on this one  i'm sorry  i'm sorry  john jones was scheduled to fight  in eight days  wow  so they tried to find a replacement fight  and again i think they went to loyota machida  and i think machida said no  i will not fight john jones without  proper training camp  and i think they got him  vitor belfort  i'm sorry  that's who he's fighting  vitor belfort did say yes  but not  now  he'll fight him  in a few weeks  he needed time to train  but they needed 
[03:04:30]  him to fight  they didn't want to cancel this card  right  so  i think they made some calls  and nobody would fight john jones  without the proper training  except chael sonan  chael said he would  i'm a complete idiot  and i want to apologize to data white  because i was confused  why he was losing his mind  i'm dumb  i thought the guy that was asked  last minute said  fuck you  i haven't been training  but this guy's been training  for a championship fight  and now another guy comes in  and he's got to fight him  fuck yeah fight him  yeah of course  get in there and fight  you fucking idiot  john jones absolutely should have 
[03:05:00]  john jones should have done it  here's why they said no  and this is what greg jackson's  thinking was  he's  like henderson is a stand up fighter  henderson  throws a fucking right  that would literally  knock fucking  i can't think of an example  but he throws a booming right  and shale is a wrestler  knock a personality  into club soda kenny  oh  no he doesn't hit that hard  yeah  he doesn't hit that  that's something you need  something they have  they have an atomic  fucking  out of smacker 
[03:05:30]  which is kenny's head  in an atom  meeting  and just talking  until the atom  hangs itself  hello adam  nothing  he's not amused  i am stupid  but shale's a wrestler  yeah  and he's the absolute  option  which is probably  why he was helping  henderson  he was probably  helping his wrestling  got it  i got it all now  so jones was training  for a stand up fighter  but i'll say this  greg jackson said  chale is just a dangerous  fighter  and he's one of those  guys  he just 
[03:06:00]  on my thinking  he just fought  silver  he went a round  and a half  with him  and lost  but he didn't go  five tough rounds  so he trained  for three months  to fight  probably the best  fighter in the world  had a pretty good  first round  and then lost  the second  so he's not beat up  from that fight  and he was training  henderson  so they'd probably  be thinking  he's in better shape  than he's acknowledging  and jones  shows john jones  respects chale  absolutely  because chale's  dangerous man  and chale has  nothing to lose 
[03:06:30]  i think unfortunately  though john jones  was in a tough spot  and should have  taken the fight  he should have  taken the fight  i was thinking  john jones  was 152  for some reason  no he was 151  let me tell you  no i  yeah obviously  let me tell you  something  if uh  if dana  and uh  company over there  um  are known  for not  cancelling events  because they can  just get a  replacement like that  and you get  a replacement  then the guy  that's originally  on the card  should have  to fucking fight  especially a  fucking  a fight like  jones  son in which 
[03:07:00]  i don't think  we'll see  that would have  been much bigger  yeah  because henderson's  a respected  tough dude  but chale just  has this thing  around him  where he's  such a shit talker  right  and he's so good  at promoting  and he's a really  tough guy  and he's crazy  like he literally  chale's so funny  he said on twitter  he goes to john jones  i make a lot more  than you  or he might have  actually said this  he goes i'll give  you my purse  i make a lot more  money than you  which of course  he doesn't  but he's like  i make a lot more  than you  i'll give you my purse  he just says anything  but what if  the other side 
[03:07:30]  of the argument  obviously it's  you know john jones  was training for  a specific fighter  so that that fucks up  his training in his  head a little bit  yeah but i think  knowing the ufc  and this happens  i think unfortunately  you gotta take the fight  you gotta  john jones  i think would  definitely beat chale  it's not a reflection  on chale  i think chale's a  lighter guy jones  is heavier  and i think jones  is much just  younger and stronger  chale uh  how does he say his name  sonnen  it's weird  you get used to  i always thought  sonnen but i guess  it's sonnen  i always said sonnen  but it's sonnen 
[03:08:00]  yeah uh  he's a character  obviously  yeah i love him  i want him on this  show desperately  i want him too  man we should get  him on the show  we love chale  get the word out  we'll take a phone  from him tomorrow  yeah  anything  but here's chale  uh  you know  you've got a guy  that's in great shape  and healthy  turning down a fight  that just doesn't  happen  you have a champion  turning down a fight  and that just doesn't  happen  and you have a main  event  that an industry  is counting on  for one bratty  entitled kid  uh  to pull the plug 
[03:08:30]  on all of that  it really  really blew me away  i've simply never  heard of it  in any of those  regards  and and he was  all of that  wrapped into one  champ main event  in shape  and still turned  it down  i do wish  that he would  consider  all of the other  people that this  affects  and there's guys  on the undercard  who are scratching  and clawing  for their chance  that are on  borrowed money  that are  sleeping at the gym  and that are  counting  on that paycheck  it's a tremendously 
[03:09:00]  big deal  for some rich  brat  out of new  mexico  to just say  the hell with you  all  some rich brat  out of new  mexico  he called him  what did  john jones say  because he didn't  he didn't talk  publicly about this  jones says  he's got a statement  though right  dan henderson got  hurt and the fight  was cancelled  i signed a contract  a long time ago  to fight dan henderson  that's what i studied  for  and that's what i  prepared myself for 
[03:09:30]  to take a fight  with a different  opponent in which  i would basically  have three days  of training  before traveling  and then starting  to cut weight  i just thought  would be the  dumbest idea  ever  i wouldn't  have been  properly  prepared  i definitely  apologize  to the other  fighters on the  card  i feel terrible  but it also  wasn't my decision  to cancel the  whole card  i don't make  those decisions  i apologize  to the people  that lost money  on tickets  and travel  and things  like that  i don't apologize  for my decision  but i do apologize  for the way  it affected  people  i hope people 
[03:10:00]  can understand  i was just  trying to do  the best thing  for my career  i'm moving  forward  i'm continuing  to work  and i'm working  on transforming  my body  from great shape  to phenomenal  shape  my goal  now is to  beat leota  better than  i did the first  time  right  i want to uh  be a better  version of myself  and i'm looking  forward to it  that was before  i think  is that you  talking or were  you reading a  statement  that was jim  norton  that's what i  would say  if i was a  man  that was jones  but i think  now it's  it's vitro  balfour  not  but you're in  great shape  you're in great 
[03:10:30]  shape and you're  hoping to get  in phenomenal  shape  i'm actually a  fat pig  so i'm on  no carbs  again  nice  oh  yeah  that's a fine  statement  now what do we  do now i think  john chokes  did the right thing  well you know  he didn't train  for that guy  so  but i think  he outweighs  chael  i think that  would have been  i was  i'd love to have  seen that fight  you gotta take  the chance  that you didn't  train for this  particular guy  because you know  as far as that  whole thing goes  you gotta kind of  be a company guy  because you're in  a business where 
[03:11:00]  you know this  happens a lot  so you know  in the back  of your head  fuck this  could happen  and you know  and by the way  he said  anderson silva  called  and agreed  to fight  jones  but it was  after the fight  he didn't realize  it was after  it was cancelled  he was calling  from brazil  oh  and his guy  called  but they'd  already cancelled  the event  so it's just  done  wait silva  john jones  i wouldn't want  to see it  like that  anyway  i wouldn't want  to see it  when anderson  silva  wasn't ready  like  you want  that as  like a  well prepared  fight  will that  ever happen  nah  silva won't 
[03:11:30]  do it  how much  money  they're gonna  lose  that's a lot  that's probably  why he's so mad  but chael son  and not  i mean  chael's a  fucking animal  he really is  i mean  for him to  shit talk  anderson silva  like that  when he knew  he had to  fight him  he's pretty  fucking  ballsy  he's a  ballsy guy  yeah  yeah  he's a  crazy white  dude  let's get  chael on the  phone  i think he  would talk  to us  yeah  you think  i don't think  anybody's talking  about this  right now  oh chael  we're all scared 
[03:12:00]  yeah we reached  out to dan white  i just texted him  i don't know  if he'll  nah we tried  oh  when you weren't  here  we tried  oh  doesn't need us  i'll just  video blog it  video blog  now what do we  got here  what  what  i just want to  remind everybody  that i got  a gig coming up  on friday  oh right  yes  remember the band  rotgut  yes  oh sure you  don't  uh  anyway  we're getting  back together 
[03:12:30]  uh  again just  for um  for some fun  shits and giggles  we rehearsed  uh last week  and then we just  rehearsed yesterday  again  how was it  hilarious  we're fucking  having such a good  time doing this  and it sounds  like amazing  i forgot how  good my brother  plays like  bass  fucking slapping  and shit  and we're  throwing together  some chili peppers  songs and uh  a lot of the  a lot of the  fun spirited  original  you're doing  red hot chili  peppers  yeah we do  a few chili  peppers  don't go  downstairs  yes  give a damn  let's go 
[03:13:00]  downstairs  i hope you  sing that wrong  oh my god  i'm at that  peloponese  because i've heard  you do that  like a thousand  times  most motherfuckers  don't go  downstairs  all confident  oh yeah  and i'd be like  fuck that's  blood sugar  sex magic  i sang that  lyric wrong  every single  time  anyway  yeah  uh  so rock  it's this  friday  9 p.m.  at kj  farrell's  that's uh  in belmore  out on long  island  242 
[03:13:30]  pettit avenue  in belmore  uh yeah  and uh  it's just gonna  be a fucking  pisser  we've been  laughing  can i go  joe curry  no  i wanna go  and fred's um  i think it's his  nephew  you still don't  know  i do  you know what  he comes in  and we gig  and he's a great  guy and everything  but we haven't  talked  we haven't  spoken or  anything  he amazingly  enough looks a lot  like danny ross  he really  they people are  gonna think you're  playing fucking  guitar for right  oh really  swear to god  oh cool  i'll get some new  fans  i really think 
[03:14:00]  people are gonna  think he looks  like danny a lot  so uh yeah  i'm psyched for  that it's gonna  be fun  i will uh expect  a complimentary  ticket  you will get  a vip  treatment  jim norton  vip  treatment  uh  yeah  i don't  once again  i don't know  how to say  your name  natas  chaos  whatever  n-a-t-a-s  k-a-o-s  he's a regular  um  just to add it  to the argument  you boys are  off  you train  for one style  no champ  ever  in capital 
[03:14:30]  letters  takes a  last minute  fight  guys who  are desperate  to  but um  i think it's  happened before  but he did  train for a  totally different  style  which i do  understand  he trained to  look out for  henderson's  right  which is  he throws a  right  that  pictures something  being knocked  over by something  powerful  that's what his  right does  you could come  up with something  try 
[03:15:00]  he throws  dude  how hard  how hard  is this  right  that fucking  thing  it's like  take  whatever the  hardest thing  you can think  of fucking  make it like  even harder  than that  and it  fucking  comes fast  i'll help  you along  something with  maybe rich  voss  he  he  fucking  he throws  such a  booming  right  something with  rich voss  that if  it fucked  it would  punch  rich voss  and like 
[03:15:30]  knock him  somewhere  into  something  that's like  fucking  whatever it  would take  whatever it  would take  to knock  rich voss  into something  so you're  saying it's  really hard  he hits  like hard  enough  i don't  know  his right  is like  fwapoon  fwapoon  fwapoon  that's pretty  bad  with henderson  he sets you  up  and when he  unloads that  he uncorks  that right  which i think  john jones  would have 
[03:16:00]  been able  to stay  away from  and he  would have  just put  dan henderson  on the  ground  well i  don't think  henderson's  ever been  submitted  no  he is  another  tough  white  psychopath  with  fucking  like  deliverance  face  yeah the  white  guys are  he's  fucking  scary  he looks  like he's  a guy  that could  literally  walk  shirtless  into any  bar  and just  try to  fuck  someone's  wife  and they  go  please  sir  please  don't  fuck  my  wife  he's  got  cauliflower  ears  and a  fucking  deadpan  stare  he's  truly  nuts  but that  fucking  i'm sure  his left 
[03:16:30]  hurts  too  but his  right  hand  motherfucking  it's been  described as  like a  fucking  just a  fucking  like a  weapon  and he  trains  actually in  irvine  right by the  improv  where i'll be  performing  thursday  through saturday  september  13th  through 15th  i'm going to  the funny bone  in columbus  september  21  when is  that  september  21  22  and i have

[03:22:00]  there's not too many  people that are like  i'm gonna be on the  air and then they get  there it's always this  roundabout yeah  falling and even when i  told my dad that i  wanted to do this he  was like are you sure  because he was in the  business for like  decades and he tried  to talk me out of it  and i should have  listened did my my  mom i said this goes  nowhere i i didn't  even say radio i think  i just said like i  wanted to be like an  audio engineer and  like you know like mix  and record like like  records and i was like  yeah yeah that's it's  too small of a field you  can't do that yeah like 
[03:22:30]  this really i this is  not gonna go anywhere  you know like when i  was before i went to  college and i went to  college for radio i  wanted to be on the  air and then i got on  a college radio and i  realized i'm not gonna  be good on the air  it's just funny it's  just one of those  things like i never  thought i was good  at well i'm not  saying i am good but  i'm definitely much  more comfortable than i  was i mean can you  think well yeah  there's when you were  an intern back in like  2005 and like or six  and like even you were  completely flustered  after eight years of  working in the business  i'm comfortable being on 
[03:23:00]  the radio yeah you get  called in or or to even  if it's something just  nonsensical and you're  immediately sweating and  red and you just don't  know what to do oh i  hated that so i guess we  got no one on the phones  back there sally pants  no so i was running on  the board all right we'll  just we'll just call yeah  hey you're on the air  what's your name sir or  ma'am  ross ross what's up  buddy hey i just want  to let you guys know i  think you're doing a  really good job even  though uh even though  your dickhead's on the  phone as far as screening  and stuff like that we  don't screen the phone  sir i haven't screened a  phone call in many years  if one of our guys goes 
[03:23:30]  out to take a dump maybe  i'll go on a phone for a  minute or two but that's  about it i like the  after show though you  guys do a really good  job of it thanks russ  we're only five minutes  in yeah let's let's do  something plenty of time  tell us how good we are  after we do something  haven't done anything yet  man i don't know how  to talk about breaking  bad i just don't know  how to talk about it  how do you talk about  it we told people we  would talk about it i  know but look it's like  we live in a dvr world  we live in an air  especially on a sunday  night it's a late sunday  night show i give up an 
[03:24:00]  hour of sleep me too  because i don't want to  be spoiled i purposely  give my like when i go to  bed for this radio show i  have to really think about  what time i'm going to  bed because it obviously  affects the time i wake  up i wake up at about  3 15 breaking bad's an  hour long it's over at  11 i purposely purposely  give myself only a four  hour sleep because i have  to see it it's gotten to  the point i have to watch  but i have to i cannot  risk go coming here on a  monday and having it  blown for me from some  phone caller or some  jackass on twitter or 
[03:24:30]  facebook i cannot risk  that's the problem  twitter's the problem and  i feel even worse for  people on the west coast  because people on the  east coast just don't  don't give a fuck  anymore and and i'm  trying to be very  careful like after  breaking bad like if i  really want to like you  know tweet like a  reaction i try not to  spoil it but there's a  lot of people who think  oh east coast is the  only place in the world  we can all talk about  breaking bad now and  like oh god if i was in  california and i was  three hours away from  watching breaking bad  and somebody spoiled it  for me on twitter that's  so much worse than like 
[03:25:00]  okay i'm gonna watch it  later on in the week  you had to see you had  to see walt strangling  skylar though you had to  see that i mean if you  remember i mean obviously  she was a problem and she  needed to be handled and  i'm just glad it got  done like that you  know hey scott what  can we do for you today  on this on this unorthodox  after show hey uh danny  you did a hell of a job  looking up stuff on the  computer that's yeah i'm  really good at that stuff  some people might say  that it's not a skill but  uh i don't know about  that so much i think 
[03:25:30]  there's a way that  there's a right way and  a wrong way to do just  about anything that that  part where uh anthony  wanted to find that toy  man you were right on it  dude dude i'm the shit  this isn't this isn't a  this is not a surprise to  me sam would have been  looking up some wwf dolls  or some shit yeah you  know for a kid who's  always making fun of eric  for writing fan fiction i  mean i think that's what  sam might be doing when  he can't find these these  you know these really easy  things to find on the  internet maybe he's just  uninterested because he's 
[03:26:00]  too busy putting his own  dream cards together maybe  he's not a summer slam guy  maybe he's putting together  his own uh fall brawl card  wcw oh it's fall brawl wcw i  don't know i don't remember  i don't know i would ask  eric but he's not even here  i can't i i have i am now  lost i don't i cannot have  any wrestling questions  answered for me i feel lost  what is the next pay-per-view  i'm at a paddock well we  could always call eric which  i'm sure we'll do before this  week is up if he's on  vacation where did he go 
[03:26:30]  do we know where he i think  he's in new hampshire oh  that's right that's right he  tweeted about being in new  hampshire all right so  listen eric is at fun spot  right because that's the  only thing to do in new  hampshire who vacations in  new hampshire i don't know  is that where um that's  where fun spot is is that  where uh cape cod's not in  new hampshire right that's  in massachusetts i've never  been there yeah i don't know  no it doesn't matter i don't  know what he's doing let's  get back to what is what  really matters here and that  is breaking bad i honestly i  don't know how to i want to  talk about it it's hard to  just jump in there's a big  episode and i'm sure a lot of 
[03:27:00]  you guys saw it out there but  at the same time i don't want  to ruin maybe we should talk  about it tomorrow hey i guess  it is late day yeah it's a  late show i mean even if i  had to be up at at eight  o'clock to go to work you  know i might not watch it i'm  just glad that i i get to it  now because i was the kind of  guy that i was saving it on  the dvr and i thought i'd be  safe so was i and i was doing  that with the walking dead  too until until uh someone's  death got spoiled for me on

[03:28:30]  something dish related but  then i remember that they're a  fine sponsor of this is this  is great and you know what  whatever channels they want to  carry hey you know what if  they're not carrying amc it's  probably they're probably being  being cunts about it yep that's  what i have to say totally agree  and here's someone that's not  listening on feedback rat spit  goes new hampshire wtf sam is a  wild man sam sam's not the one  in new hampshire right yeah i  know where sam is and sam's  definitely out of new hampshire  sam's in like hawaii isn't he

[03:29:30]  shop for danny is looking to adopt  a dog dude dog shopping is hard  you're gonna be a first-time dog  owner and i'm i'm a few weeks into  this i guess mm-hmm because i just  don't i guess you you think you know  where to start but is that even the  right place yeah so here i am just  just me and my google skills a lot to  think about finding a dog it is a lot  to think about because you want a  puppy do you want a rescue no i'm  you want an older dog no i don't  here's what i don't want a dog with  special needs i don't want to adopt 
[03:30:00]  your shitty dog my dog well anyone's  shitty dog for that no and i don't  want to adopt your shitty dog because  your shitty dog pukes on the carpet  when you play with it for fucking two  seconds so fuck your shitty dog and  it's fucking snoring and it's  collapsed trachea right as a prop it's  fucking throat open with a bone just  so it doesn't suffocate in its sleep so  we'll we'll knock french bulldogs off  yeah no that's not a breed for me okay  i don't think i like i like a a dog  that uh doesn't risk dying in the night 
[03:30:30]  okay french bulldog would not be for  you no i'm not that a french bulldog is  like having like a two-year-old baby  that you have to just you just have to  make sure it's breathing every now and  again yeah i'll wake up in the morning  i'll wake up you know at three in the  morning and um and i'll listen and if  he's not like snoring i'll be like oh  yeah i remember when my my little  brother and me and my little brother  we have an 11 year difference so it's  it's quite a bit and i remember one  time he was sick he was really sick  with a bad cold or whatever it was and  you know he's like sniffing and 
[03:31:00]  coughing and all that and i remember  like you know a few minutes had went by  without hearing like a sniffle or a  cough and i'm in the other room going  is he dead did he just die in there  because i don't hear anything i'm  like i don't need that with a dog and  those those dogs just make so much  goddamn noise man but you know you go to  a shelter and it's like i don't  want a puppy so they have maybe 10 to  15 adult dogs and half of them have  been through the mill so many times  that they're just unadoptable because  you know oh this one got sent home  with a family and then it bit the baby  in the face so and he doesn't like 
[03:31:30]  other dogs and so well now i don't want  it now i don't i'm sorry i'm a lot i'm  a dying i understand that this shitty  dog would love a forever home but that  home is not mine because i don't want  your shit i need a dog that i could  mold into my dog my bff forever but i  can't i can't have a puppy at the same  time so how the fuck do you do this  yeah puppies a lot of work and you  wouldn't be able to yeah this is  shitty yeah you're gonna be a terrible  owner why because you're just gonna  care about it for a week and then you  can't just blindly say things like that 
[03:32:00]  if you're gonna say that then you need  to give me an example of what of why  i'm gonna be a shitty dog owner um you  can't just say that why what am i not  gonna i'm not gonna take the dog for a  dog i don't know you you you know  what you go away a lot that's not true  so where am i going so what are you  gonna do when we go to our next live  event when's that happening i don't  know but what do you do plenty of time  to figure it out see like i'm the kind  of guy that would never send my dog to  like uh uh what do you call it um like 
[03:32:30]  a shelter for the weekend yeah yeah like  i would just feel too bad like yeah but  i have dog friends like i could leave my  dog dog friends yes we talk all the  days they're some of my only friends  but uh no i mean you know uh i have i  have friends in the neighborhood i  could leave i can leave my dog with  their dog or something like that i'm  sure that could work so then what are  you looking for then like i mean like  like i can't read wise i just so you  just want like a shitty little mutt  that like you can find under the bridge  or or do you want you know there's a  lot of factors that i'm that there's a 
[03:33:00]  lot of factors and some fashionable dog  that you could put in like your man bag  and walk into the store with i'm not  opposed to one of those dogs because i  understand space space requirements of a  dog and i'm not a selfish content i don't  think that i'm going to get a 75 80  pound sporting dog and throwing and throw  it in an apartment where i'm out for some  of the day that's a shitty thing to do so  whereas i used to be opposed to something  like a rat terrier or a chihuahua i think i  would be okay with it now just you got to  compromise and you got to be careful too  because you know like just like me like 
[03:33:30]  you're renting and like what if this dog  has separation anxiety and just like  well dude eats your entire house my  landlord she already told me that like  there will be additional uh security  deposits if i do go the dog route but uh  i'm just amazed that they're cool with  it because i wasn't expecting to get a  yes on this one so now that the answer  is a yes now it's like all right dude  balls in your court now now get a fucking  dog stupid you've been you've been  yapping about it for so long now you got  to do it and now it's like i just like  you go to the shelter and like i was  saying there's 15 adult dogs so it's 
[03:34:00]  like what am i supposed to do just pick  one of these fucking dogs no you don't  have to you can just wait and that's  what i'm doing i'm waiting and you know  i'm trying to i think the way to do this  is so like if you go and you see the  dog ask to hang out with the dog try to  get a vibe off the dog and like i did it  this weekend and there was a dog she was  she was cool she was submissive she was  giving me the bellies and everything but i  noticed that she got rowdy real quick and  distracted really quick and then i you  know the the there was no spark there so  i was like fuck it gotta move on you  gotta wait for a spark gotta move on  candy man wants to help me find a dog 
[03:34:30]  i don't know how he's gonna do it though  how are you gonna do this candy man do i  do i just say dog in a mirror three  times  no um what we've done uh we've gone the  puppy in the rescue route but what we  started doing is you go to a breeder and  ask to get a place dog that like they  use the stud or to breed with that's like  a year or two old and they're usually  more adjusted and they don't have to deal  with a crazy dog that's what we just we  just got one now yeah that costs a lot  more money than just picking up a  rescue yeah no it's about the same  prices we rescued a dog before and it  was like 200 bucks and the same thing 
[03:35:00]  with the breeder is about two hundred  dollars i think i would figure a  breeder is looking for more coin yeah  well i guess it depends on the kind of  dog now they're just looking to place  the dog in a home we got a basset hound  and she's awesome and she's placed we  rescued basset hounds one was great the  other one was a nut that i had to take  back so um and especially with a puppy  this was the best way for us because  they were usually more adjusted i would  feel like such a piece of shit bringing a  dog back yeah you know it was right  because my chick was saying that too  because what that the dog i was playing  with at the shelter you know they had 
[03:35:30]  you know they returned this dog and she  would drive home she's like how the fuck  do you return a dog like i would just  feel that like i'm not saying like i  wouldn't do it because you know  obviously i'm not who knows you know  who knows but yeah exactly i'm not  gonna ruin my life just because you  know i've got something where i don't  want to return a dog but like i would  just feel like the biggest piece of  shit to bring this dog home and then be  like all right yeah and that's why  that's why i want to spend the time  you know finding that one because i  don't want to do that either i just  think that's a shitty thing thanks a  lot candy man i don't know if that's  gonna do it for me but some of these  people they like i'm glad that people 
[03:36:00]  are calling and they want to help me  but like this isn't gonna work matt  what's up hey i think you should get a  great day yeah i should get a great  day old yeah no seriously he's a  year old i live in a one-bedroom  apartment out in california he he's  you get a crate train you get him on a  schedule he's perfect listen i'm not i'm  not i would love a great day i'm not  shoveling fucking 10 pound shits at  fucking 340 in the morning okay that's  not for me those are some horse shit  dude i know i it's all about what you

[03:37:30]  know what though a great dane one of  those breeds that i wouldn't get because  they break down young ish and i can't  deal with that  uh again it's all about how you breed  how you raise no but i mean like for a  while that was the only advice bobby  could give  so do your research on them they're  they're great indoors i'm not i dude  i'm sorry i'm not getting  i appreciate the although kind words  yeah exactly danny's gonna look like a 
[03:38:00]  big gay boy  and you're gonna have your great dane  you're gonna get the last laugh i can't  no look i know what's for me i know  what's not for me a fucking a large  breed dog is not for me why it's not  from i just know it i'm not not for a  first fucking dog man like it's not  like i haven't had dogs before but  never independent like i've had a dog  with a girlfriend and their family or  something like that but it's never i  never had my fuck you it's my dog so  now that it's fuck you it's my dog your  dog not her dog yeah i know but it's  not gonna be a great day no i  appreciate it but thank you thank you 
[03:38:30]  thank you thank you i don't know how to  do this i just don't know how to do it  because you can't go to the same  shelters over and over it's just the  same shitty dogs well that's why you  gotta go to different places when me  and my chick got i gotta go out of  town right we went all the way out to  to long island whoa and we lived well  wow geez shit we lived in brooklyn  gee cosmo did you fucking how'd you make  it all the way out there to fucking  pick up jer jeez did you take the li ee  we went like five different places and  it's tough because you walk into a 
[03:39:00]  place and and and you so you you want  a dog you know and you're like okay  the dog's gonna be here like this is it  here i go i'm getting a dog and then  you gotta walk out of there you gotta go  and i'll tell you something and there  was besides that shitty old dog that  was returned a whole bunch of times  there was a cute little brown right a  little younger than i would want but a  little hound big floppy ears i'm like  oh i'm gonna play with that dog so of  course i work up the courage to ask one  of the people there about the dog it's  in the adoption process they just threw  it in there with another dog i'm just  like fuck you know because it's killing 
[03:39:30]  me man because this is like it's one of  those things you can't sleep on it's  like you gotta always be looking you  have to always be because who knows  maybe you miss a great dog you're like  fuck man and maybe that was your dog  yeah but you know what the right dog's  gonna come along for you i hope so  there's a lot of a lot of people i  know there's a lot of dog lovers i  guess yeah we should really get to a  few of these yeah hey uh bob you're on  the after show talking about dogs  yeah hey uh yeah i i saw i started  looking at the shelters all around  birmingham and uh and i saw a dog that  i loved her the way she looked she was 
[03:40:00]  part dead part boxer dog no that's  great pit and boxer that's awesome  i'm not the size dog you can have but i  didn't want to buy one on look so i  went to other shelters around first  looking at different dogs and so i  finally went by her humane society to  look at her and they had the dogs in  these six by six uh concrete kennels  you know three per thing and all the  dogs were barking and spinning around  and everything and when i got to her  she was in amongst these other dogs and  she was just laying there just sitting 
[03:40:30]  there looking around with her paws  crossed all calm and i thought i took  her out so when you go and she ended up  immediately she bonded to me and she has  been for two and a half years been the  best animal i've ever seen she stays in  the house alone for 12 hours a day  doesn't pee  great what a great owner  well i mean i don't do that normally i have to work late  dead shit  well that's what i have to work too but that was one of the things that  that that made me not have a dog for so long because i knew i was out of the house for a long 
[03:41:00]  time and i just it's unfair it's unfair to keep a dog crated up for for eight twelve hours a day it's kind  of she has run to the townhouse so i mean she sleeps in the bed a while she'll go sleep on the couch  she'll she'll move it she'll get one of my shoes and move it from one part of the house the other so i can see  where she's been all day long but the thing is just don't take one on looks just go and watch how to  behave for a while no no i hear you i think we're on the same page there but it's just like i i you know  i don't know where to go to find dog volume i i could find puppy volume i could i could find weight 
[03:41:30]  you gotta go to all the shelters puppy weight is fine but adult adult dog volume is difficult  it might sound counterintuitive but you wouldn't believe what great dogs i i had a  uh greyhound one time that was a retired racer you know they were i was looking at some of those  because they're low i always thought that they were high energy they're not they are such cows  potatoes they sleep 20 hours a day they are they are the best they are the best animals you've ever  seen yeah look i mean i would i would definitely be down for that if i can if i came across a uh a 
[03:42:00]  retired greyhound or an adult greyhound i would not rule that out i know not all of them race  thank you very much they don't all have to be retired no no i know but i'm saying but a lot of them are and i  would definitely you know i would definitely go after one of those guys those guys are unloved and  they end up you know kicked to the curb just like santa's little helper yeah who didn't want to save  santa's little helper yeah i was all about it uh who's next here i don't know it's everybody's  gonna say the same thing oh you should get this dog because i have that dog yeah you should get a 
[03:42:30]  french bulldog yes yeah that's that's not great advice somebody on uh you know what everybody thinks  that you know that that their dog is is the best kind of dog and that's totally fair gotta look  into boxers gotta get this gotta get a say saint bernard yeah but you know what like everyone's  gonna do that and whatever dog you get you're gonna be the same way you know you're gonna be like  i like vichlas i love you gotta get a vichla somebody somebody give me their vichla right now  if you have a well-behaved trained vichla that knows lots of tricks here's what you do with the 
[03:43:00]  after show this week and sam's out i'm just gonna solicit dog solicitation solicit a vichla all right  that's it guys you have until friday to find me a beautiful vichla i am using my i am using my  position and this radio gig i'm using it for my benefit why don't you get a schnoodle you know  someone on well somebody on my on twitter at danny j ross if you follow me on twitter at danny j ross  somebody uh suggested that i should look into a schnoodle yeah i i think you should get a schnoodle  this is not not bobo no i mean it's just a mutt what a pretty name i saw some some what are those 
[03:43:30]  uh puggles puggles puggles they're adorable until they're about a year old then they just look and  then they look like ugly ugly dogs like they're just big big grown ugly dogs and they're just not  good here wait i'm gonna go to chris for a sec chris you're on the after opian anthony live portion  of the show hey uh i uh i command you for adopting dogs uh i just did it but uh check  out petfinder dude i'm on petfinder every day and it's a difficult site to navigate it's it's way too 
[03:44:00]  many search results with not a lot of weeding i see there's a lot of options yeah but not really  it's like what are you looking for a dog or a cat no but i also see that a lot of people miss  mislabel like their breeds like i typed in i i know enough for the french bulldogs but like i typed  in french bulldogs and there's fucking chihuahuas that pop up there it's not what i'm looking for  and it's it might just be a tool to lead you to i mean there's so many more organizations yeah  well shelters well i told you you know what it is it's not it's not so much that i think that 
[03:44:30]  searching on petfinder is is good i think that petfinder is good for helping you find shelters  that are close by and then you could see what animals are available at your local shelters rather  than us this global you know usa wide search for a specific breed that that's what i that's what i found  anyway it it took me about three months till i found the dog is right for me and uh man one day  you're gonna meet a dog you're just gonna know i know but that's i know it's gonna happen but you  know what like he's saying you know chris he's saying it took him three months to find that dog 
[03:45:00]  and like that's that's the pat not panic but i know it's not a weekend thing this isn't something  where i'm gonna visit like two or three shelters and there's my dog so you know it's it's this constant  hunt that's that's becoming uh not not not not a bother because it's never no it's been longer  dude i've been looking at this for a while it's just like i don't want to just go to north shore  animal league every fucking week that's not how i'm gonna that's not how this is gonna work go to  the long island greyhound transfer i might have to you want to get laid you got to put in the time to 
[03:45:30]  get you know to meet the right chick yeah he's going facebook you're like who wants to fuck me  when it comes to you who wants me to adopt them yeah hey who's got a dog that's that's how this is  that's how this whole game has been working for me anyway good luck to you man thank you buddy  have a good one i appreciate the help now sean knows all about dogs sean what do you what's  your recommendations for me what should i do i would go with a female wamara i want one dude  they're great they're great dogs but you know what they got a lot of energy and i can't sit there  running around with a fucking dog all day not well now they've got they've got lower energy than a 
[03:46:00]  this one if you get a female and get her fixed man fuck it they're like cow's potatoes i thought  you're going somewhere else sorry no yeah i was just looking for the bone i was looking for the  silver lining no i just thought that was a bonus that'll get you some chicks man beautiful coat  blue-eyed dog i mean god damn come on yeah well it's not so much see i think i think a lot of the  listeners out there are confused it's not like i don't know what breed of dog to get like i kind  of have that down i know what what direction i want to go and i just don't know how you start the  hunt dude like where do you go like i i just don't know i don't know pet finder is great you know 
[03:46:30]  i live on long island there's a local long uh long island animal shelter that's that's decent but  oh yeah you should go uptown to this animal care and control place i had to drop something off  there one day yeah i think i heard of there there's a ton of dogs that's like because they're the actual  like they're the pound right like when they talk about like all the dogs at the pound like that's  that's the real deal pound it was depressing i can't remember why i went there but i just remember  waiting for for whoever i drove there to come back and and it's just this it's just this line of 
[03:47:00]  people with dogs or cats just just waiting to to to get the fuck out of my life that's like the  real death sentence fuck it really is it's it's depressing that's like the ren and stimpy pound  yeah i don't know man well i'm glad that this is a topic that a lot of people have advice uh on  mike mike hey i think yeah hey i think you're being short-sighted here i think you ought to get like a  chicken or fucking or chupacabras or even a goat well you know i know that you could probably i 
[03:47:30]  know some places in queens to get goats because uh new york being the uh the cultural melting pot  that it is you can get any kind of stuff like that but how cool would you be walking around with  a chicken on a leash okay and if it dies you eat the son of a bitch whereas if you get a dog  you can't eat him unless you're vietnamese all right i'm just done with hack jokes like  you had to know it was coming i was just waiting for it you'll never guess the listener made a 
[03:48:00]  reference about some asian people eating a dog oh that's crazy yeah can we can you call back i  didn't hear i hope so i'm sure he will i'm sure he's a uh a regular listener of this of this fine  program see all these people they they're not giving me what i want here it's just you should get  this you should get that you need a french a blue french bulldog yeah no i would love a blue  french bulldog no john we're not even taking your call now hi john you need the blue one no we got 
[03:48:30]  there no i don't need that i don't want that blue is gorgeous color i don't care i'm with you john  i don't care i just i don't i don't need breed advice i just i want to know the process it's the  it's the whole the process of meeting and and knowing which one is it's like it's like getting  married i i fail in every relationship i have i'm gonna find a fucking dog that's gonna live with  me for years see that's why i think you're gonna fail as a dog owner you're gonna get tired of your 
[03:49:00]  dog you're gonna want a new dog i never said that i was i was going to be a successful dog this dog  doesn't cuddle with me anymore what are you gonna say i'm gonna cheat on my dog i think you're trying  to apply i'm gonna cheat on my dog that's not even nice i haven't even met my dog yet you've already  you've already got this whole relationship i think finding a dog is just like finding a chick before  facebook because you already made the facebook analogy yeah but i pick out a dog the same way  i'm picking out a relationship i go oh that one looks nice yeah but then sometimes they don't work 
[03:49:30]  out and then they bite your baby's face yeah sometimes you hang out for 20 minutes and you're like  god this chick sucks well that's what happened i went to north shore animal league and i was like  oh what a nice dog and then the dog starts paying attention to someone else just like every real  every other relationship i have i'm like well fuck this bitch quite literally this person has cookies  yeah exactly oh bacon oh look oh that's the person that i am i'm familiar with i've heard i've  had history with that person so fuck you it's not easy dog and dude it's all the same i don't know 
[03:50:00]  it's it's just across species lines all the behaviors are the same as long as i  have treats for you you're my best friend have you checked out the new york visla rescue  no well you know what i checked out no because i emailed the fucking long island visla rescue  you know and some fucking old lady with an aol email address and they don't get back to you it's  like all these all these rescue websites the websites were put together in in in 1999  these really are shitty their best photo available their best view to netscape and navigator 
[03:50:30]  yeah this place apparently has two dogs for adoption and neither was  and then people go but that's but that's funny because everybody goes oh go to a rescue go to a  rescue website these are the fucking rescue websites so what am i supposed to do and i'm not  dude when i get home now i'm sorry i sound like bob dude but when i get home in the afternoon it's  you know two three o'clock i'm sort of tired i mean it's not like it's not like i'm like oh my day  was so hard but who who wants to at three o'clock now start driving around to to who knows where  into connecticut oh see see what you're saying oh who wants to do this after i get home that's 
[03:51:00]  how you're going to be when it's time to walk the dog no that's i don't have to go into jersey  to walk my dog i don't got to fucking pay a toll on the fucking tappan z bridge to walk my dog take  a shit i don't want to walk the dog well yeah walking a dog in the rain sucks but but it's better  than having shit on your computer chair so you do it just go to these places you know what you do  take a couple days off you just got to do it on the weekend no i want to save those for for dog  break-in period all right yeah fair enough yeah you're gonna need some time to break in your dog 
[03:51:30]  now this i can't do you want a male or a female i want a female why because i want to be able to  have sex with it just in case my chick leaves yeah but butthole male dog's butthole tighter too  wasn't thinking yeah well that's like a great day no i'm just thinking female dog because they're  typically smaller and they typically have a more by what five pounds five or ten in an apartment it's a  it's a it makes a difference a ten ten pounds makes a difference on a female dog suck why  because they're they're they're more temperamental what a surprise dr gay wants all the dicks 
[03:52:00]  flapping around yeah what does a dog if he doesn't have a penis give me some dog dicks and i'm happy  boy can't have a dog if there's no rocket you know what i always how you supposed to go for rocket  ride i always like male dogs and female cats well i don't like cats cats are fucking useless  i don't have cats anymore cats are useless things you want a dog that's like a manly pet you get a  man dog i don't understand how people they they go oh like that they're they squish their cat into  their chest and they go i love my cat my cat loves me and all that cat wants to do is just leave and 
[03:52:30]  scratch the shit out of you and be like fuck off they're just they have that face like i hate this  person i hate him but he feeds me so i have to keep showing up here cats suck a cock a cock i don't  understand cat people i never will i was always a cat person and then uh then when we got married  my my chick wanted a dog they fucking suck and i was like all right let's get a dog and now i'm  all dog i'm biased though because i'm allergic uh you know so obviously that does weigh a little  bit on my you're allergic you're allergic to dogs a little bit allergic to my dog oh yeah but it's  very specific allergy it's bulldog saliva like they have to be licking all over me and it sucks 
[03:53:00]  they see everybody they still with the breeds boston terrier boston terriers are great you need  to pick look i don't all these people sound very smart to me help i don't i know what breed i'm  looking for it's no you don't it's not about that boston terrier is great though yeah see this kind  of sounds like something i'm into carla you have some good advice it sounds like and i think i  might want to try this well i work with a lot of animal rescues here in cleveland and one thing you  could do is find who the rescues are that pull dogs from the kennels from the kill shelters and you 
[03:53:30]  can become a foster and that means you kind of give them the criteria of what kind of dog  conform and they can match you up that way and you can foster it which means it's a temporary dog  in your home and now what now can you keep the foster if you and if you fall in love with it  absolutely you can definitely adopt it from the rescue that you're working with or if it doesn't  work out then the rescue can what if you foster a dog and the foster dog is like john uh john connor's 
[03:54:00]  friend or no like john connor in terminator 2 and he just treats you like an asshole and you have to  kill the dog huh give it back you give it back to a safe rescue and then the rescue will find  another foster home for it what if the dog just takes off on his dirt bike like fuck you mom  i have a friend who uh i have a friend who who fosters uh french bulldogs and and i would love to do  that australian for beer i would love to do that but i know that the first dog i get i'm gonna be like  nah i can't get rid of this dog i'm keeping this dog yeah that's how i ended up before yeah see it's 
[03:54:30]  impossible you can't have a dog in your house for for for a month and then not want to well i mean  you're probably gonna fall in love with the query dogs and have quirks yeah you're gonna love i know  that's why this is so difficult it's just it's not i don't want to say it's hard it's not a hard it's  not stressing on me it's you know but it is difficult it's a difficult process people who foster dogs they  got a lot of respect for that's tough definitely sorry i'm sorry yeah you should be don't interrupt the  man when he's talking i was done who the fuck are you um i was gonna say it's definitely true that 
[03:55:00]  dog kind of picks you and you you get with the dog that you know is great i volunteer at the shelter  and some dogs i'm just in love with and some dogs it's like oh you're a cool dog but  yeah see that's how i felt with this dog we were playing and she was cool and you know she was like  oh you're a cool human i was like you're a cool dog but we weren't we weren't we definitely there was  no love connection there there was no love connection it'll definitely happen when it's  right for sure yeah it's just you know i guess i just gotta keep telling i just gotta keep getting  out there man you know you just gotta keep playing the field thanks carl yeah you know you can't what 
[03:55:30]  do you expect you can't expect these dogs to come over to your house and just sit down on the couch  with you man you gotta get out there you gotta want it known it it would be easier if you could  just pick up a dog at a bar i guess they have dog bars do they have dog bars they have bars that you  can bring your dog too really but i want to start drinking again yeah but most of them are already  taken what do you mean like people bring them they're not giving them away like they're gonna  bring them back home dog bars yeah what are you talking about there's bars you have been to a bar 
[03:56:00]  i think so they serve alcohol yeah yes okay there are bars in in the city that allow you to bring  your dog yeah but what are you saying i'm saying that you can't just bring a dog that you find at a  bar home oh that's the part that's where i was like what are you talking about no people have  brought those dogs and they plan on no i no i i understand that but i would love i would love  to go get ripped with my dog yeah that's something that's that sounds like a fun there there's some  dog bars there's just you know there's a few things that i guess people want like like there's a reason 
[03:56:30]  why people want their dog for companionship or whatever else and it's just like i just don't see  what like there's no better time than just running around like rolling rolling around with a dog  flinging tennis balls at each other all day like how is that just not the first thing your dog how to  throw a tennis ball dude my my old dog she would fucking throw the ball back at you like not like  hard like it's gonna like you're gonna be like nice arm or nice mouth dog like she'd fucking wing  that shit you just take it wear face back and forth yeah playing fetch is fun it is fun but you got to go  out there you got you can't save this stuff for the weekend you know why i have to no all the good 
[03:57:00]  ones are taken during the week because they're like you know what we should probably go out all right  so okay so after all the set is done here and i walk in my house and and i take a dump and it's  3 30 now where am i going now you go to the to the where am i going to the long island greyhound  transfer and you say oh okay you don't have any dogs for me i'll see you later and then you go  back home and you cross that one off your list well no you don't cross it off the list you just say i'll  be back tomorrow you cross it off the list for how long because what's the rotation at 24 hours 
[03:57:30]  24 hours yeah go back just call them say hey i was here the other day do they really have new dogs  every day though like just these places have new daily dogs well maybe not like these these breed  specific rescues but places like uh like uh north shore animal league or whatever absolutely they get  new dogs every single day well my my ex used to work there or maybe she still does but if she does  that's kind of maybe she can give you like the inside track to a good dog well no but like for as many 
[03:58:00]  dogs as they have out like i know they have a ton of dogs that are like they just haven't made it to  like it's like the hall of fame where they have like a ton of like collectible stuff in the basement  well it's like the dogs that have that have been like whipped into behaving you know and then there's  the dogs that they're not quite they're not quite ready for prime time players like those guys like  they're still in the back they're being worked on but uh but that's not what i'm looking for either  because all you know like and then there's always going to be a ton of puppies and young dogs but i  can't have a five-month-old puppy yeah but you know what you're you're in a good position because so 
[03:58:30]  many people do want puppies doggy style ah get it hey danny yeah uh if you want to check out this  website it's called petfinder.com oh suck a dick sal no because literally i've had maybe 80 phone  calls hey danny should check out this website called uh petfinder have you been listening at all  have you yes are you sure unfortunately yes all right well good luck with that sal why don't you  click off that mic and we'll finish up the show here we talked about petfinder so 
[03:59:00]  there you go anyway as i was saying before you made your doggy style joke that was a joke  oh okay uh you're in a great position because a lot of people you know especially families you know  they want the puppy and they want to go they want to go adopt a puppy and a lot of people don't want  an adult dog and and it's great when there's people like you that do want an adult i thought it  was weird because even at the shelter that i went to some you know whoever worked there i you know  she's like what are you looking for and i'm like well you know an adult dog you know over a year  old they don't get that a lot yeah and i was expecting her to after i kind of you know rattled 
[03:59:30]  out my criteria i expected her to be like you know thinking oh you know we have buddy or we have molly  she was just like oh and that was like not even like a suggestion for me there you go look at all  of these dogs that i have for you yeah i mean yeah you are you're you're you're in a good position if  you're doing that i just wish that the p like i like i told you i emailed that long island  vishla rescue whatever i figured that would be call them they have a phone number yeah i know but  it's like why can't you just email me back just what are you being far too lazy for somebody that 
[04:00:00]  wants a dog you know like i wanted this dog but i email and they hurry up actually so i guess i'm  not getting a dog you know what because you start making i like emails are i like having records of  things because this is it apartment hunting is the same way because then all of a sudden people are  calling you and you have no idea who these people are and then everything is a fucking sammy jankis  scenario where you have to pretend that you understand and know who this person is let's  call you this guy he calls me to look at an apartment right he goes daddy i'm like yeah he  goes he goes hey man sorry about last week but uh if you want to meet up tomorrow i could do about

[04:01:00]  and living things right let me have a record where i could go through a paper trail and be like okay oh  yes this is that dog this is the dog but that has liquid shits all over the place these are specific  places though i emailed another person before i would have called but you know i didn't have time  because we were doing things but i emailed another person about some beautiful little dog  sorry i'm just looking at dogs i know it's easy to it's easy it is easy i saw a three-legged guy i  showed you mr three legs i'll have a three-legged dog i'm in no position to adopt a dog and since
